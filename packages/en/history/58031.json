McCloy\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForeword\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON, by Executive Order No. 11130 dated\r\nNovember 29, 1963,[F-1] created this Commission to investigate the\r\nassassination on November 22, 1963, of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the\r\n35th President of the United States. The President directed the\r\nCommission to evaluate all the facts and circumstances surrounding the\r\nassassination and the subsequent killing of the alleged assassin and to\r\nreport its findings and conclusions to him.[F-2]\r\n\r\nThe subject of the Commission’s inquiry was a chain of events which\r\nsaddened and shocked the people of the United States and of the world.\r\nThe assassination of President Kennedy and the simultaneous wounding\r\nof John B. Connally, Jr., Governor of Texas, had been followed within\r\nan hour by the slaying of Patrolman J. D. Tippit of the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment. In the United States and abroad, these events evoked\r\nuniversal demands for an explanation.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the assassination, State and local officials in\r\nDallas devoted their resources to the apprehension of the assassin.\r\nThe U.S. Secret Service, which is responsible for the protection\r\nof the President, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation began an\r\ninvestigation at the direction of President Johnson. Within 35 minutes\r\nof the killing of Patrolman Tippit, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested\r\nby the Dallas police as a suspect in that crime. Based on evidence\r\nprovided by Federal, State, and local agencies, the State of Texas\r\narraigned Oswald within 12 hours of his arrest, charging him with the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy and the murder of Patrolman Tippit.\r\nOn November 24, 1963, less than 48 hours after his arrest, Oswald was\r\nfatally shot in the basement of the Dallas Police Department by Jack\r\nRuby, a Dallas nightclub owner. This shooting took place in full view\r\nof a national television audience.\r\n\r\nThe events of these 2 days were witnessed with shock and disbelief\r\nby a Nation grieving the loss of its young leader. Throughout the\r\nworld, reports on these events were disseminated in massive detail.\r\nTheories and speculations mounted regarding the assassination. In many\r\ninstances, the intense public demand for facts was met by partial\r\nand frequently conflicting reports from Dallas and elsewhere. After\r\nOswald’s arrest and his denial of all guilt, public attention focused\r\nboth on the extent of the evidence against him and the possibility of\r\na conspiracy, domestic or foreign. His subsequent death heightened\r\npublic interest and stimulated additional suspicions and rumors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMISSION AND ITS POWERS\r\n\r\nAfter Lee Harvey Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby, it was no longer\r\npossible to arrive at the complete story of the assassination through\r\nnormal judicial procedures during a trial of the alleged assassin.\r\nAlternative means for instituting a complete investigation were widely\r\ndiscussed. Federal and State officials conferred on the possibility of\r\ninitiating a court of inquiry before a State magistrate in Texas. An\r\ninvestigation by the grand jury of Dallas County also was considered.\r\nAs speculation about the existence of a foreign or domestic conspiracy\r\nbecame widespread, committees in both Houses of Congress weighed the\r\ndesirability of congressional hearings to discover all the facts\r\nrelating to the assassination.\r\n\r\nBy his order of November 29 establishing the Commission, President\r\nJohnson sought to avoid parallel investigations and to concentrate\r\nfactfinding in a body having the broadest national mandate. As Chairman\r\nof the Commission, President Johnson selected Earl Warren, Chief\r\nJustice of the United States, former Governor and attorney general of\r\nthe State of California. From the U.S. Senate, he chose Richard B.\r\nRussell, Democratic Senator from Georgia and chairman of the Senate\r\nArmed Services Committee, former Governor of, and county attorney in,\r\nthe State of Georgia, and John Sherman Cooper, Republican Senator\r\nfrom Kentucky, former county and circuit judge, State of Kentucky,\r\nand U.S. Ambassador to India. Two members of the Commission were\r\ndrawn from the U.S. House of Representatives: Hale Boggs, Democratic\r\nU.S. Representative from Louisiana and majority whip, and Gerald R.\r\nFord, Republican, U.S. Representative from Michigan and chairman of\r\nthe House Republican Conference. From private life, President Johnson\r\nselected two lawyers by profession, both of whom have served in the\r\nadministrations of Democratic and Republican Presidents: Allen W.\r\nDulles, former Director of Central Intelligence, and John J. McCloy,\r\nformer President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and\r\nDevelopment, former U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, and during\r\nWorld War II, the Assistant Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nFrom its first meeting on December 5, 1963, the Commission viewed the\r\nExecutive order as an unequivocal Presidential mandate to conduct a\r\nthorough and independent investigation. Because of the numerous rumors\r\nand theories, the Commission concluded that the public interest in\r\ninsuring that the truth was ascertained could not be met by merely\r\naccepting the reports or the analyses of Federal or State agencies.\r\nNot only were the premises and conclusions of those reports critically\r\nreassessed, but all assertions or rumors relating to a possible\r\nconspiracy, or the complicity of others than Oswald, which have come to\r\nthe attention of the Commission, were investigated.\r\n\r\nOn December 13, 1963, Congress enacted Senate Joint Resolution 137\r\n(Public Law 88-202)[F-3] empowering the Commission to issue subpoenas\r\nrequiring the testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence\r\nrelating to any matter under its investigation. In addition, the\r\nresolution authorized the Commission to compel testimony from witnesses\r\nclaiming the privilege against self-incrimination under the fifth\r\namendment to the U.S. Constitution by providing for the grant of\r\nimmunity to persons testifying under such compulsion. Immunity under\r\nthese provisions was not granted to any witness during the Commission’s\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nThe Commission took steps immediately to obtain the necessary staff\r\nto fulfill its assignment. J. Lee Rankin, former Solicitor General of\r\nthe United States, was sworn in as general counsel for the Commission\r\non December 16, 1963. Additional members of the legal staff were\r\nselected during the next few weeks. The Commission has been aided by 14\r\nassistant counsel with high professional qualifications, selected by it\r\nfrom widely separated parts of the United States. This staff undertook\r\nthe work of the Commission with a wealth of legal and investigative\r\nexperience and a total dedication to the determination of the truth.\r\nThe Commission has been assisted also by highly qualified personnel\r\nfrom several Federal agencies, assigned to the Commission at its\r\nrequest. This group included lawyers from the Department of Justice,\r\nagents of the Internal Revenue Service, a senior historian from the\r\nDepartment of Defense, an editor from the Department of State, and\r\nsecretarial and administrative staff supplied by the General Services\r\nAdministration and other agencies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the assistance afforded by Federal agencies,\r\nthe Commission throughout its inquiry had the cooperation of\r\nrepresentatives of the city of Dallas and the State of Texas. The\r\nattorney general of Texas, Waggoner Carr, aided by two distinguished\r\nlawyers of that State, Robert G. Storey of Dallas, retired dean of\r\nthe Southern Methodist University Law School and former president of\r\nthe American Bar Association, and Leon Jaworski of Houston, former\r\npresident of the Texas State Bar Association, has been fully informed\r\nat all times as to the progress of the investigation, and has advanced\r\nsuch suggestions as he and his special assistants considered helpful\r\nto the accomplishment of the Commission’s assignment. Attorney General\r\nCarr has promptly supplied the Commission with pertinent information\r\npossessed by Texas officials. Dallas officials, particularly those from\r\nthe police department, have fully complied with all requests made by\r\nthe Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nDuring December and early January the Commission received an increasing\r\nvolume of reports from Federal and State investigative agencies. Of\r\nprincipal importance was the five-volume report of the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation, submitted on December 9, 1963, which summarized\r\nthe results of the investigation conducted by the Bureau immediately\r\nafter the assassination. After reviewing this report, the Commission\r\nrequested the Federal Bureau of Investigation to furnish the underlying\r\ninvestigative materials relied upon in the summary report. The first\r\ninvestigative reports submitted in response to this request were\r\ndelivered to the Commission on December 20, 1963. On December 18, the\r\nSecret Service submitted a detailed report on security precautions\r\ntaken before President Kennedy’s trip to Texas and a summary of the\r\nevents of November 22, as witnessed by Secret Service agents. A few\r\ndays later the Department of State submitted a report relating to\r\nOswald’s defection to the Soviet Union in 1959, and his return to the\r\nUnited States in 1962. On January 7 and 11, 1964, the attorney general\r\nof Texas submitted an extensive set of investigative materials, largely\r\nDallas police reports, on the assassination of President Kennedy and\r\nthe killing of Oswald.\r\n\r\nAs these investigative reports were received, the staff began\r\nanalyzing and summarizing them. The members of the legal staff,\r\ndivided into teams, proceeded to organize the facts revealed by\r\nthese investigations, determine the issues, sort out the unresolved\r\nproblems, and recommend additional investigation by the Commission.\r\nSimultaneously, to insure that no relevant information would be\r\noverlooked, the Commission directed requests to the 10 major\r\ndepartments of the Federal Government, 14 of its independent agencies\r\nor commissions, and 4 congressional committees for all information\r\nrelating to the assassination or the background and activities of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald and Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the accumulating materials, the Commission directed\r\nnumerous additional requests to Federal and State investigative\r\nagencies. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service\r\nexecuted the detailed requests for statements of witnesses and\r\nexaminations of physical evidence with dispatch and thoroughness. All\r\nthese reports were reviewed and analyzed by the Commission. Additional\r\ninvestigative requests, where appropriate, were handled by Internal\r\nRevenue Service, Department of State, and the military intelligence\r\nagencies with comparable skill. Investigative analyses of particular\r\nsignificance and sensitivity in the foreign areas were contributed\r\nby the Central Intelligence Agency. On occasion the Commission used\r\nindependent experts from State and city governments to supplement or\r\nverify information. During the investigation the Commission on several\r\noccasions visited the scene of the assassination and other places in\r\nthe Dallas area pertinent to the inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe scope and detail of the investigative effort by the Federal and\r\nState agencies are suggested in part by statistics from the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation and the Secret Service. Immediately after the\r\nassassination more than 80 additional FBI personnel were transferred to\r\nthe Dallas office on a temporary basis to assist in the investigation.\r\nBeginning November 22, 1963, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\r\nconducted approximately 25,000 interviews and reinterviews of persons\r\nhaving information of possible relevance to the investigation and by\r\nSeptember 11, 1964, submitted over 2,300 reports totaling approximately\r\n25,400 pages to the Commission. During the same period the Secret\r\nService conducted approximately 1,550 interviews and submitted 800\r\nreports totaling some 4,600 pages.\r\n\r\nBecause of the diligence, cooperation, and facilities of Federal\r\ninvestigative agencies, it was unnecessary for the Commission to\r\nemploy investigators other than the members of the Commission’s legal\r\nstaff. The Commission recognized, however, that special measures were\r\nrequired whenever the facts or rumors called for an appraisal of the\r\nacts of the agencies themselves. The staff reviewed in detail the\r\nactions of several Federal agencies, particularly the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation, the Secret Service, the Central Intelligence Agency,\r\nand the Department of State. Initially the Commission requested the\r\nagencies to furnish all their reports relating to the assassination\r\nand their relationships with Oswald or Ruby. On the basis of these\r\nreports, the Commission submitted specific questions to the agency\r\ninvolved. Members of the staff followed up the answers by reviewing\r\nthe relevant files of each agency for additional information. In some\r\ninstances, members of the Commission also reviewed the files in person.\r\nFinally, the responsible officials of these agencies were called to\r\ntestify under oath. Dean Rusk, Secretary of State; C. Douglas Dillon,\r\nSecretary of the Treasury; John A. McCone, Director of the Central\r\nIntelligence Agency; J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau\r\nof Investigation; and James J. Rowley, Chief of the Secret Service,\r\nappeared as witnesses and testified fully regarding their agencies’\r\nparticipation in the matters under scrutiny by the Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION HEARINGS\r\n\r\nIn addition to the information resulting from these investigations, the\r\nCommission has relied primarily on the facts disclosed by the sworn\r\ntestimony of the principal witnesses to the assassination and related\r\nevents. Beginning on February 3, 1964, the Commission and its staff\r\nhas taken the testimony of 552 witnesses. Of this number, 94 appeared\r\nbefore members of the Commission; 395 were questioned by members of\r\nthe Commission’s legal staff; 61 supplied sworn affidavits; and 2\r\ngave statements.[F-4] Under Commission procedures, all witnesses were\r\nadvised that they had the right to the presence and the advice of their\r\nlawyer during the interrogation, with the corollary rights to raise\r\nobjections to any questions asked, to make any clarifying statement on\r\nthe record after the interrogation, and to purchase a copy of their\r\ntestimony.[F-5]\r\n\r\nCommission hearings were closed to the public unless the witness\r\nappearing before the Commission requested an open hearing. Under these\r\nprocedures, testimony of one witness was taken in a public hearing\r\non two occasions. No other witness requested a public hearing. The\r\nCommission concluded that the premature publication by it of testimony\r\nregarding the assassination or the subsequent killing of Oswald might\r\ninterfere with Ruby’s rights to a fair and impartial trial on the\r\ncharges filed against him by the State of Texas. The Commission also\r\nrecognized that testimony would be presented before it which would\r\nbe inadmissible in judicial proceedings and might prejudice innocent\r\nparties if made public out of context. In addition to the witnesses\r\nwho appeared before the Commission, numerous others provided sworn\r\ndepositions, affidavits, and statements upon which the Commission\r\nhas relied. Since this testimony, as well as that taken before the\r\nCommission, could not always be taken in logical sequence, the\r\nCommission concluded that partial publication of testimony as the\r\ninvestigation progressed was impractical and could be misleading.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMISSION’S FUNCTION\r\n\r\nThe Commission’s most difficult assignments have been to uncover\r\nall the facts concerning the assassination of President Kennedy and\r\nto determine if it was in any way directed or encouraged by unknown\r\npersons at home or abroad. In this process, its objective has been to\r\nidentify the person or persons responsible for both the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy and the killing of Oswald through an examination\r\nof the evidence. The task has demanded unceasing appraisal of the\r\nevidence by the individual members of the Commission in their effort to\r\ndiscover the whole truth.\r\n\r\nThe procedures followed by the Commission in developing and assessing\r\nevidence necessarily differed from those of a court conducting a\r\ncriminal trial of a defendant present before it, since under our system\r\nthere is no provision for a posthumous trial. If Oswald had lived he\r\ncould have had a trial by American standards of justice where he would\r\nhave been able to exercise his full rights under the law. A judge and\r\njury would have presumed him innocent until proven guilty beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt. He might have furnished information which could have\r\naffected the course of his trial. He could have participated in and\r\nguided his defense. There could have been an examination to determine\r\nwhether he was sane under prevailing legal standards. All witnesses,\r\nincluding possibly the defendant, could have been subjected to\r\nsearching examination under the adversary system of American trials.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has functioned neither as a court presiding over an\r\nadversary proceeding nor as a prosecutor determined to prove a case,\r\nbut as a factfinding agency committed to the ascertainment of the\r\ntruth. In the course of the investigation of the facts and rumors\r\nsurrounding these matters, it was necessary to explore hearsay and\r\nother sources of information not admissible in a court proceeding\r\nobtained from persons who saw or heard and others in a position to\r\nobserve what occurred. In fairness to the alleged assassin and his\r\nfamily, the Commission on February 25, 1964, requested Walter E.\r\nCraig, president of the American Bar Association, to participate in\r\nthe investigation and to advise the Commission whether in his opinion\r\nthe proceedings conformed to the basic principles of American justice.\r\nMr. Craig accepted this assignment and participated fully and without\r\nlimitation. He attended Commission hearings in person or through his\r\nappointed assistants. All working papers, reports, and other data in\r\nCommission files were made available, and Mr. Craig and his associates\r\nwere given the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, to recall any\r\nwitness heard prior to his appointment, and to suggest witnesses whose\r\ntestimony they would like to have the Commission hear. This procedure\r\nwas agreeable to counsel for Oswald’s widow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMISSION’S REPORT\r\n\r\nIn this report the Commission submits the results of its investigation.\r\nEach member of the Commission has given careful consideration to\r\nthe entire report and concurs in its findings and conclusions. The\r\nreport consists of an initial chapter summarizing the Commission’s\r\nbasic findings and conclusions, followed by a detailed analysis of\r\nthe facts and the issues raised by the events of November 22, 1963,\r\nand the 2 following days. Individual chapters consider the trip to\r\nDallas, the shots from the Texas School Book Depository, the identity\r\nof the assassin, the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald, the possibility\r\nof a conspiracy, Oswald’s background and possible motive, and\r\narrangements for the protection of the President. In these chapters,\r\nrather than rely on cross references, the Commission on occasion has\r\nrepeated certain testimony in order that the reader might have the\r\nnecessary information before him while examining the conclusions of the\r\nCommission on each important issue.\r\n\r\nWith this report the Commission is submitting the complete testimony\r\nof all the witnesses who appeared before the Commission or gave sworn\r\ndepositions or affidavits, the accompanying documentary exhibits, and\r\nother investigative materials which are relied upon in this report.

A young and vigorous leader\r\nwhose years of public and private life stretched before him was the\r\nvictim of the fourth Presidential assassination in the history of a\r\ncountry dedicated to the concepts of reasoned argument and peaceful\r\npolitical change. This Commission was created on November 29, 1963,\r\nin recognition of the right of people everywhere to full and truthful\r\nknowledge concerning these events. This report endeavors to fulfill\r\nthat right and to appraise this tragedy by the light of reason and the\r\nstandard of fairness. It has been prepared with a deep awareness of\r\nthe Commission’s responsibility to present to the American people an\r\nobjective report of the facts relating to the assassination.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF EVENTS\r\n\r\nAt 11:40 a.m., c.s.t., on Friday, November 22, 1963, President John\r\nF. Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy, and their party arrived at Love Field,\r\nDallas, Tex. Behind them was the first day of a Texas trip planned\r\n5 months before by the President, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson,\r\nand John B. Connally, Jr., Governor of Texas. After leaving the White\r\nHouse on Thursday morning, the President had flown initially to San\r\nAntonio where Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson joined the party and\r\nthe President dedicated new research facilities at the U.S. Air Force\r\nSchool of Aerospace Medicine. Following a testimonial dinner in Houston\r\nfor U.S. Representative Albert Thomas, the President flew to Fort Worth\r\nwhere he spent the night and spoke at a large breakfast gathering on\r\nFriday.\r\n\r\nPlanned for later that day were a motorcade through downtown Dallas,\r\na luncheon speech at the Trade Mart, and a flight to Austin where\r\nthe President would attend a reception and speak at a Democratic\r\nfundraising dinner. From Austin he would proceed to the Texas ranch of\r\nthe Vice President. Evident on this trip were the varied roles which\r\nan American President performs--Head of State, Chief Executive, party\r\nleader, and, in this instance, prospective candidate for reelection.\r\n\r\nThe Dallas motorcade, it was hoped, would evoke a demonstration of the\r\nPresident’s personal popularity in a city which he had lost in the 1960\r\nelection. Once it had been decided that the trip to Texas would span 2\r\ndays, those responsible for planning, primarily Governor Connally and\r\nKenneth O’Donnell, a special assistant to the President, agreed that\r\na motorcade through Dallas would be desirable. The Secret Service was\r\ntold on November 8 that 45 minutes had been allotted to a motorcade\r\nprocession from Love Field to the site of a luncheon planned by Dallas\r\nbusiness and civic leaders in honor of the President. After considering\r\nthe facilities and security problems of several buildings, the Trade\r\nMart was chosen as the luncheon site. Given this selection, and in\r\naccordance with the customary practice of affording the greatest number\r\nof people an opportunity to see the President, the motorcade route\r\nselected was a natural one. The route was approved by the local host\r\ncommittee and White House representatives on November 18 and publicized\r\nin the local papers starting on November 19. This advance publicity\r\nmade it clear that the motorcade would leave Main Street and pass the\r\nintersection of Elm and Houston Streets as it proceeded to the Trade\r\nMart by way of the Stemmons Freeway.\r\n\r\nBy midmorning of November 22, clearing skies in Dallas dispelled the\r\nthreat of rain and the President greeted the crowds from his open\r\nlimousine without the “bubbletop,” which was at that time a plastic\r\nshield furnishing protection only against inclement weather. To the\r\nleft of the President in the rear seat was Mrs. Kennedy. In the jump\r\nseats were Governor Connally, who was in front of the President, and\r\nMrs. Connally at the Governor’s left. Agent William R. Greer of the\r\nSecret Service was driving, and Agent Roy H. Kellerman was sitting to\r\nhis right.\r\n\r\nDirectly behind the Presidential limousine was an open “followup” car\r\nwith eight Secret Service agents, two in the front seat, two in the\r\nrear, and two on each running board. These agents, in accordance with\r\nnormal Secret Service procedures, were instructed to scan the crowds,\r\nthe roofs, and windows of buildings, overpasses, and crossings for\r\nsigns of trouble. Behind the “followup” car was the Vice-Presidential\r\ncar carrying the Vice President and Mrs. Johnson and Senator Ralph W.\r\nYarborough. Next were a Vice-Presidential “followup” car and several\r\ncars and buses for additional dignitaries, press representatives, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe motorcade left Love Field shortly after 11:50 a.m., and proceeded\r\nthrough residential neighborhoods, stopping twice at the President’s\r\nrequest to greet well-wishers among the friendly crowds. Each time\r\nthe President’s car halted, Secret Service agents from the “followup”\r\ncar moved forward to assume a protective stance near the President\r\nand Mrs. Kennedy. As the motorcade reached Main Street, a principal\r\neast-west artery in downtown Dallas, the welcome became tumultuous.\r\nAt the extreme west end of Main Street the motorcade turned right on\r\nHouston Street and proceeded north for one block in order to make a\r\nleft turn on Elm Street, the most direct and convenient approach to the\r\nStemmons Freeway and the Trade Mart. As the President’s car approached\r\nthe intersection of Houston and Elm Streets, there loomed directly\r\nahead on the intersection’s northwest corner a seven-story, orange\r\nbrick warehouse and office building, the Texas School Book Depository.\r\nRiding in the Vice President’s car, Agent Rufus W. Youngblood of the\r\nSecret Service noticed that the clock atop the building indicated 12:30\r\np.m., the scheduled arrival time at the Trade Mart.\r\n\r\nThe President’s car which had been going north made a sharp turn\r\ntoward the southwest onto Elm Street. At a speed of about 11 miles per\r\nhour, it started down the gradual descent toward a railroad overpass\r\nunder which the motorcade would proceed before reaching the Stemmons\r\nFreeway. The front of the Texas School Book Depository was now on the\r\nPresident’s right, and he waved to the crowd assembled there as he\r\npassed the building. Dealey Plaza--an open, landscaped area marking the\r\nwestern end of downtown Dallas--stretched out to the President’s left.\r\nA Secret Service agent riding in the motorcade radioed the Trade Mart\r\nthat the President would arrive in 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nSeconds later shots resounded in rapid succession. The President’s\r\nhands moved to his neck. He appeared to stiffen momentarily and lurch\r\nslightly forward in his seat. A bullet had entered the base of the back\r\nof his neck slightly to the right of the spine. It traveled downward\r\nand exited from the front of the neck, causing a nick in the left lower\r\nportion of the knot in the President’s necktie. Before the shooting\r\nstarted, Governor Connally had been facing toward the crowd on the\r\nright. He started to turn toward the left and suddenly felt a blow on\r\nhis back. The Governor had been hit by a bullet which entered at the\r\nextreme right side of his back at a point below his right armpit. The\r\nbullet traveled through his chest in a downward and forward direction,\r\nexited below his right nipple, passed through his right wrist which had\r\nbeen in his lap, and then caused a wound to his left thigh. The force\r\nof the bullet’s impact appeared to spin the Governor to his right, and\r\nMrs. Connally pulled him down into her lap. Another bullet then struck\r\nPresident Kennedy in the rear portion of his head, causing a massive\r\nand fatal wound. The President fell to the left into Mrs. Kennedy’s lap.\r\n\r\nSecret Service Agent Clinton J. Hill, riding on the left running board\r\nof the “followup” car, heard a noise which sounded like a firecracker\r\nand saw the President suddenly lean forward and to the left. Hill\r\njumped off the car and raced toward the President’s limousine. In the\r\nfront seat of the Vice-Presidential car, Agent Youngblood heard an\r\nexplosion and noticed unusual movements in the crowd. He vaulted into\r\nthe rear seat and sat on the Vice President in order to protect him.\r\nAt the same time Agent Kellerman in the front seat of the Presidential\r\nlimousine turned to observe the President. Seeing that the President\r\nwas struck, Kellerman instructed the driver, “Let’s get out of here;\r\nwe are hit.” He radioed ahead to the lead car, “Get us to the hospital\r\nimmediately.” Agent Greer immediately accelerated the Presidential car.\r\nAs it gained speed, Agent Hill managed to pull himself onto the back of\r\nthe car where Mrs. Kennedy had climbed. Hill pushed her back into the\r\nrear seat and shielded the stricken President and Mrs. Kennedy as the\r\nPresident’s car proceeded at high speed to Parkland Memorial Hospital,\r\n4 miles away.\r\n\r\nAt Parkland, the President was immediately treated by a team of\r\nphysicians who had been alerted for the President’s arrival by the\r\nDallas Police Department as the result of a radio message from the\r\nmotorcade after the shooting. The doctors noted irregular breathing\r\nmovements and a possible heartbeat, although they could not detect a\r\npulsebeat. They observed the extensive wound in the President’s head\r\nand a small wound approximately one-fourth inch in diameter in the\r\nlower third of his neck. In an effort to facilitate breathing, the\r\nphysicians performed a tracheotomy by enlarging the throat wound and\r\ninserting a tube. Totally absorbed in the immediate task of trying to\r\npreserve the President’s life, the attending doctors never turned the\r\nPresident over for an examination of his back. At 1 p.m., after all\r\nheart activity ceased and the Last Rites were administered by a priest,\r\nPresident Kennedy was pronounced dead. Governor Connally underwent\r\nsurgery and ultimately recovered from his serious wounds.\r\n\r\nUpon learning of the President’s death, Vice President Johnson left\r\nParkland Hospital under close guard and proceeded to the Presidential\r\nplane at Love Field. Mrs. Kennedy, accompanying her husband’s body,\r\nboarded the plane shortly thereafter. At 2:38 p.m., in the central\r\ncompartment of the plane, Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as the 36th\r\nPresident of the United States by Federal District Court Judge Sarah T.\r\nHughes. The plane left immediately for Washington, D.C., arriving at\r\nAndrews AFB, Md., at 5:58 p.m., e.s.t. The President’s body was taken\r\nto the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Md., where it was given\r\na complete pathological examination. The autopsy disclosed the large\r\nhead wound observed at Parkland and the wound in the front of the neck\r\nwhich had been enlarged by the Parkland doctors when they performed the\r\ntracheotomy. Both of these wounds were described in the autopsy report\r\nas being “presumably of exit.” In addition the autopsy revealed a small\r\nwound of entry in the rear of the President’s skull and another wound\r\nof entry near the base of the back of the neck. The autopsy report\r\nstated the cause of death as “Gunshot wound, head,” and the bullets\r\nwhich struck the President were described as having been fired “from a\r\npoint behind and somewhat above the level of the deceased.”\r\n\r\nAt the scene of the shooting, there was evident confusion at the\r\noutset concerning the point of origin of the shots. Witnesses differed\r\nin their accounts of the direction from which the sound of the shots\r\nemanated. Within a few minutes, however, attention centered on the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building as the source of the shots.\r\nThe building was occupied by a private corporation, the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Co., which distributed school textbooks of several\r\npublishers and leased space to representatives of the publishers. Most\r\nof the employees in the building worked for these publishers. The\r\nbalance, including a 15-man warehousing crew, were employees of the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Co. itself.\r\n\r\nSeveral eyewitnesses in front of the building reported that they saw a\r\nrifle being fired from the southeast corner window on the sixth floor\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository. One eyewitness, Howard L. Brennan,\r\nhad been watching the parade from a point on Elm Street directly\r\nopposite and facing the building. He promptly told a policeman that he\r\nhad seen a slender man, about 5 feet 10 inches, in his early thirties,\r\ntake deliberate aim from the sixth-floor corner window and fire a rifle\r\nin the direction of the President’s car. Brennan thought he might be\r\nable to identify the man since he had noticed him in the window a few\r\nminutes before the motorcade made the turn onto Elm Street. At 12:34\r\np.m., the Dallas police radio mentioned the Depository Building as\r\na possible source of the shots, and at 12:45 p.m., the police radio\r\nbroadcast a description of the suspected assassin based primarily on\r\nBrennan’s observations.\r\n\r\nWhen the shots were fired, a Dallas motorcycle patrolman, Marrion L.\r\nBaker, was riding in the motorcade at a point several cars behind the\r\nPresident. He had turned right from Main Street onto Houston Street\r\nand was about 200 feet south of Elm Street when he heard a shot.\r\nBaker, having recently returned from a week of deer hunting, was\r\ncertain the shot came from a high-powered rifle. He looked up and saw\r\npigeons scattering in the air from their perches on the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Building. He raced his motorcycle to the building,\r\ndismounted, scanned the area to the west and pushed his way through the\r\nspectators toward the entrance. There he encountered Roy Truly, the\r\nbuilding superintendent, who offered Baker his help. They entered the\r\nbuilding, and ran toward the two elevators in the rear. Finding that\r\nboth elevators were on an upper floor, they dashed up the stairs. Not\r\nmore than 2 minutes had elapsed since the shooting.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the second-floor landing on their way up to the top\r\nof the building, Patrolman Baker thought he caught a glimpse of someone\r\nthrough the small glass window in the door separating the hall area\r\nnear the stairs from the small vestibule leading into the lunchroom.\r\nGun in hand, he rushed to the door and saw a man about 20 feet away\r\nwalking toward the other end of the lunchroom. The man was emptyhanded.\r\nAt Baker’s command, the man turned and approached him. Truly, who had\r\nstarted up the stairs to the third floor ahead of Baker, returned\r\nto see what had delayed the patrolman. Baker asked Truly whether he\r\nknew the man in the lunchroom. Truly replied that the man worked in\r\nthe building, whereupon Baker turned from the man and proceeded, with\r\nTruly, up the stairs. The man they encountered had started working\r\nin the Texas School Book Depository Building on October 16, 1963. His\r\nfellow workers described him as very quiet--a “loner.” His name was Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nWithin about 1 minute after his encounter with Baker and Truly, Oswald\r\nwas seen passing through the second-floor offices. In his hand was a\r\nfull “Coke” bottle which he had purchased from a vending machine in\r\nthe lunchroom. He was walking toward the front of the building where\r\na passenger elevator and a short flight of stairs provided access to\r\nthe main entrance of the building on the first floor. Approximately 7\r\nminutes later, at about 12:40 p.m., Oswald boarded a bus at a point on\r\nElm Street seven short blocks east of the Depository Building. The bus\r\nwas traveling west toward the very building from which Oswald had come.\r\nIts route lay through the Oak Cliff section in southwest Dallas, where\r\nit would pass seven blocks east of the roominghouse in which Oswald was\r\nliving, at 1026 North Beckley Avenue. On the bus was Mrs. Mary Bledsoe,\r\none of Oswald’s former landladies who immediately recognized him.\r\nOswald stayed on the bus approximately 3 or 4 minutes, during which\r\ntime it proceeded only two blocks because of the traffic jam created by\r\nthe motorcade and the assassination. Oswald then left the bus.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later he entered a vacant taxi four blocks away and asked\r\nthe driver to take him to a point on North Beckley Avenue several\r\nblocks beyond his roominghouse. The trip required 5 or 6 minutes. At\r\nabout 1 p.m. Oswald arrived at the roominghouse. The housekeeper, Mrs.\r\nEarlene Roberts, was surprised to see Oswald at midday and remarked\r\nto him that he seemed to be in quite a hurry. He made no reply. A few\r\nminutes later Oswald emerged from his room zipping up his jacket and\r\nrushed out of the house.\r\n\r\nApproximately 14 minutes later, and just 45 minutes after the\r\nassassination, another violent shooting occurred in Dallas. The victim\r\nwas Patrolman J. D. Tippit of the Dallas police, an officer with a\r\ngood record during his more than 11 years with the police force. He\r\nwas shot near the intersection of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, about\r\nnine-tenths of a mile from Oswald’s roominghouse. At the time of the\r\nassassination, Tippit was alone in his patrol car, the routine practice\r\nfor most police patrol cars at this time of day. He had been ordered by\r\nradio at 12:45 p.m. to proceed to the central Oak Cliff area as part of\r\na concentration of patrol car activity around the center of the city\r\nfollowing the assassination. At 12:54 Tippit radioed that he had moved\r\nas directed and would be available for any emergency. By this time the\r\npolice radio had broadcast several messages alerting the police to\r\nthe suspect described by Brennan at the scene of the assassination--a\r\nslender white male, about 30 years old, 5 feet 10 inches and weighing\r\nabout 165 pounds.\r\n\r\nAt approximately 1:15 p.m., Tippit was driving slowly in an easterly\r\ndirection on East 10th Street in Oak Cliff. About 100 feet past the\r\nintersection of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, Tippit pulled up\r\nalongside a man walking in the same direction. The man met the general\r\ndescription of the suspect wanted in connection with the assassination.\r\nHe walked over to Tippit’s car, rested his arms on the door on the\r\nright-hand side of the car, and apparently exchanged words with Tippit\r\nthrough the window. Tippit opened the door on the left side and started\r\nto walk around the front of his car. As he reached the front wheel on\r\nthe driver’s side, the man on the sidewalk drew a revolver and fired\r\nseveral shots in rapid succession, hitting Tippit four times and\r\nkilling him instantly. An automobile repairman, Domingo Benavides,\r\nheard the shots and stopped his pickup truck on the opposite side of\r\nthe street about 25 feet in front of Tippit’s car. He observed the\r\ngunman start back toward Patton Avenue, removing the empty cartridge\r\ncases from the gun as he went. Benavides rushed to Tippit’s side. The\r\npatrolman, apparently dead, was lying on his revolver, which was out\r\nof its holster. Benavides promptly reported the shooting to police\r\nheadquarters over the radio in Tippit’s car. The message was received\r\nshortly after 1:16 p.m.\r\n\r\nAs the gunman left the scene, he walked hurriedly back toward Patton\r\nAvenue and turned left, heading south. Standing on the northwest corner\r\nof 10th Street and Patton Avenue was Helen Markham, who had been\r\nwalking south on Patton Avenue and had seen both the killer and Tippit\r\ncross the intersection in front of her as she waited on the curb for\r\ntraffic to pass. She witnessed the shooting and then saw the man with a\r\ngun in his hand walk back toward the corner and cut across the lawn of\r\nthe corner house as he started south on Patton Avenue.\r\n\r\nIn the corner house itself, Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis and her\r\nsister-in-law, Mrs. Virginia Davis, heard the shots and rushed to the\r\ndoor in time to see the man walk rapidly across the lawn shaking a\r\nrevolver as if he were emptying it of cartridge cases. Later that day\r\neach woman found a cartridge case near the house. As the gunman turned\r\nthe corner he passed alongside a taxicab which was parked on Patton\r\nAvenue, a few feet from 10th Street. The driver, William W. Scoggins,\r\nhad seen the slaying and was now crouched behind his cab on the street\r\nside. As the gunman cut through the shrubbery on the lawn, Scoggins\r\nlooked up and saw the man approximately 12 feet away. In his hand was a\r\npistol and he muttered words which sounded to Scoggins like “poor dumb\r\ncop” or “poor damn cop.”\r\n\r\nAfter passing Scoggins, the gunman crossed to the west side of Patton\r\nAvenue and ran south toward Jefferson Boulevard, a main Oak Cliff\r\nthoroughfare. On the east side of Patton, between 10th Street and\r\nJefferson Boulevard, Ted Callaway, a used car salesman, heard the shots\r\nand ran to the sidewalk. As the man with the gun rushed past, Callaway\r\nshouted “What’s going on?” The man merely shrugged, ran on to Jefferson\r\nBoulevard and turned right. On the next corner was a gas station with a\r\nparking lot in the rear. The assailant ran into the lot, discarded his\r\njacket and then continued his flight west on Jefferson.\r\n\r\nIn a shoe store a few blocks farther west on Jefferson, the manager,\r\nJohnny Calvin Brewer, heard the siren of a police car moments after\r\nthe radio in his store announced the shooting of the police officer in\r\nOak Cliff. Brewer saw a man step quickly into the entranceway of the\r\nstore and stand there with his back toward the street. When the police\r\ncar made a =U=-turn and headed back in the direction of the Tippit\r\nshooting, the man left and Brewer followed him. He saw the man enter\r\nthe Texas Theatre, a motion picture house about 60 feet away, without\r\nbuying a ticket. Brewer pointed this out to the cashier, Mrs. Julia\r\nPostal, who called the police. The time was shortly after 1:40 p.m.\r\n\r\nAt 1:29 p.m., the police radio had noted the similarity in the\r\ndescriptions of the suspects in the Tippit shooting and the\r\nassassination. At 1:45 p.m., in response to Mrs. Postal’s call, the\r\npolice radio sounded the alarm: “Have information a suspect just went\r\nin the Texas Theatre on West Jefferson.” Within minutes the theater\r\nwas surrounded. The house lights were then turned up. Patrolman M. N.\r\nMcDonald and several other policemen approached the man, who had been\r\npointed out to them by Brewer.\r\n\r\nMcDonald ordered the man to his feet and heard him say, “Well, it’s all\r\nover now.” The man drew a gun from his waist with one hand and struck\r\nthe officer with the other. McDonald struck out with his right hand and\r\ngrabbed the gun with his left hand. After a brief struggle McDonald and\r\nseveral other police officers disarmed and handcuffed the suspect and\r\ndrove him to police headquarters, arriving at approximately 2 p.m.\r\n\r\nFollowing the assassination, police cars had rushed to the Texas School\r\nBook Depository in response to the many radio messages reporting that\r\nthe shots had been fired from the Depository Building. Inspector J.\r\nHerbert Sawyer of the Dallas Police Department arrived at the scene\r\nshortly after hearing the first of these police radio messages at 12:34\r\np.m. Some of the officers who had been assigned to the area of Elm\r\nand Houston Streets for the motorcade were talking to witnesses and\r\nwatching the building when Sawyer arrived. Sawyer entered the building\r\nand rode a passenger elevator to the fourth floor, which was the top\r\nfloor for this elevator. He conducted a quick search, returned to the\r\nmain floor and, between approximately 12:37 and 12:40 p.m., ordered\r\nthat no one be permitted to leave the building.\r\n\r\nShortly before 1 p.m. Capt. J. Will Fritz, chief of the homicide and\r\nrobbery bureau of the Dallas Police Department, arrived to take charge\r\nof the investigation. Searching the sixth floor, Deputy Sheriff Luke\r\nMooney noticed a pile of cartons in the southeast corner. He squeezed\r\nthrough the boxes and realized immediately that he had discovered the\r\npoint from which the shots had been fired. On the floor were three\r\nempty cartridge cases. A carton had apparently been placed on the floor\r\nat the side of the window so that a person sitting on the carton could\r\nlook down Elm Street toward the overpass and scarcely be noticed from\r\nthe outside. Between this carton and the half-open window were three\r\nadditional cartons arranged at such an angle that a rifle resting on\r\nthe top carton would be aimed directly at the motorcade as it moved\r\naway from the building. The high stack of boxes, which first attracted\r\nMooney’s attention, effectively screened a person at the window from\r\nthe view of anyone else on the floor.\r\n\r\nMooney’s discovery intensified the search for additional evidence on\r\nthe sixth floor, and at 1:22 p.m., approximately 10 minutes after the\r\ncartridge cases were found, Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone turned his\r\nflashlight in the direction of two rows of boxes in the northwest\r\ncorner near the staircase. Stuffed between the two rows was a\r\nbolt-action rifle with a telescopic sight. The rifle was not touched\r\nuntil it could be photographed. When Lt. J. C. Day of the police\r\nidentification bureau decided that the wooden stock and the metal knob\r\nat the end of the bolt contained no prints, he held the rifle by the\r\nstock while Captain Fritz ejected a live shell by operating the bolt.\r\nLieutenant Day promptly noted that stamped on the rifle itself was the\r\nserial number “C2766” as well as the markings “1940” “MADE ITALY” and\r\n“CAL. 6.5.” The rifle was about 40 inches long and when disassembled it\r\ncould fit into a handmade paper sack which, after the assassination,\r\nwas found in the southeast corner of the building within a few feet of\r\nthe cartridge cases.\r\n\r\nAs Fritz and Day were completing their examination of this rifle on the\r\nsixth floor, Roy Truly, the building superintendent, approached with\r\ninformation which he felt should be brought to the attention of the\r\npolice. Earlier, while the police were questioning the employees, Truly\r\nhad observed that Lee Harvey Oswald, 1 of the 15 men who worked in the\r\nwarehouse, was missing. After Truly provided Oswald’s name, address,\r\nand general description, Fritz left for police headquarters. He arrived\r\nat headquarters shortly after 2 p.m. and asked two detectives to pick\r\nup the employee who was missing from the Texas School Book Depository.\r\nStanding nearby were the police officers who had just arrived with\r\nthe man arrested in the Texas Theatre. When Fritz mentioned the name\r\nof the missing employee, he learned that the man was already in the\r\ninterrogation room. The missing School Book Depository employee and the\r\nsuspect who had been apprehended in the Texas Theatre were one and the\r\nsame--Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nThe suspect Fritz was about to question in connection with the\r\nassassination of the President and the murder of a policeman was born\r\nin New Orleans on October 18, 1939, 2 months after the death of his\r\nfather. His mother, Marguerite Claverie Oswald, had two older children.\r\nOne, John Pic, was a half-brother to Lee from an earlier marriage which\r\nhad ended in divorce. The other was Robert Oswald, a full brother to\r\nLee and 5 years older. When Lee Oswald was 3, Mrs. Oswald placed him in\r\nan orphanage where his brother and half-brother were already living,\r\nprimarily because she had to work.\r\n\r\nIn January 1944, when Lee was 4, he was taken out of the orphanage, and\r\nshortly thereafter his mother moved with him to Dallas, Tex., where\r\nthe older boys joined them at the end of the school year. In May of\r\n1945 Marguerite Oswald married her third husband, Edwin A. Ekdahl.\r\nWhile the two older boys attended a military boarding school, Lee\r\nlived at home and developed a warm attachment to Ekdahl, occasionally\r\naccompanying his mother and stepfather on business trips around the\r\ncountry. Lee started school in Benbrook, Tex., but in the fall of\r\n1946, after a separation from Ekdahl, Marguerite Oswald reentered Lee\r\nin the first grade in Covington, La. In January 1947, while Lee was\r\nstill in the first grade, the family moved to Fort Worth, Tex., as the\r\nresult of an attempted reconciliation between Ekdahl and Lee’s mother.\r\nA year and a half later, before Lee was 9, his mother was divorced\r\nfrom her third husband as the result of a divorce action instituted by\r\nEkdahl. Lee’s school record during the next 5½ years in Fort Worth was\r\naverage, although generally it grew poorer each year. The comments of\r\nteachers and others who knew him at that time do not reveal any unusual\r\npersonality traits or characteristics.\r\n\r\nAnother change for Lee Oswald occurred in August 1952, a few months\r\nafter he completed the sixth grade. Marguerite Oswald and her\r\n12-year-old son moved to New York City where Marguerite’s oldest\r\nson, John Pic, was stationed with the Coast Guard. The ensuing year\r\nand one-half in New York was marked by Lee’s refusals to attend\r\nschool and by emotional and psychological problems of a seemingly\r\nserious nature. Because he had become a chronic school truant, Lee\r\nunderwent psychiatric study at Youth House, an institution in New\r\nYork for juveniles who have had truancy problems or difficulties\r\nwith the law, and who appear to require psychiatric observation,\r\nor other types of guidance. The social worker assigned to his case\r\ndescribed him as “seriously detached” and “withdrawn” and noted “a\r\nrather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally starved,\r\naffectionless youngster.” Lee expressed the feeling to the social\r\nworker that his mother did not care for him and regarded him as a\r\nburden. He experienced fantasies about being all powerful and hurting\r\npeople, but during his stay at Youth House he was apparently not\r\na behavior problem. He appeared withdrawn and evasive, a boy who\r\npreferred to spend his time alone, reading and watching television.\r\nHis tests indicated that he was above average in intelligence for\r\nhis age group. The chief psychiatrist of Youth House diagnosed Lee’s\r\nproblem as a “personality pattern disturbance with schizoid features\r\nand passive-aggressive tendencies.” He concluded that the boy was “an\r\nemotionally, quite disturbed youngster” and recommended psychiatric\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nIn May 1953, after having been at Youth House for 3 weeks, Lee Oswald\r\nreturned to school where his attendance and grades temporarily\r\nimproved. By the following fall, however, the probation officer\r\nreported that virtually every teacher complained about the boy’s\r\nbehavior. His mother insisted that he did not need psychiatric\r\nassistance. Although there was apparently some improvement in Lee’s\r\nbehavior during the next few months, the court recommended further\r\ntreatment. In January 1954, while Lee’s case was still pending,\r\nMarguerite and Lee left for New Orleans, the city of Lee’s birth.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to New Orleans, Lee maintained mediocre grades but\r\nhad no obvious behavior problems. Neighbors and others who knew him\r\noutside of school remembered him as a quiet, solitary and introverted\r\nboy who read a great deal and whose vocabulary made him quite\r\narticulate. About 1 month after he started the 10th grade and 11 days\r\nbefore his 16th birthday in October 1955, he brought to school a note\r\npurportedly written by his mother, stating that the family was moving\r\nto California. The note was written by Lee. A few days later he dropped\r\nout of school and almost immediately tried to join the Marine Corps.\r\nBecause he was only 16, he was rejected.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving school Lee worked for the next 10 months at several jobs\r\nin New Orleans as an office messenger or clerk. It was during this\r\nperiod that he started to read communist literature. Occasionally,\r\nin conversations with others, he praised communism and expressed to\r\nhis fellow employees a desire to join the Communist Party. At about\r\nthis time, when he was not yet 17, he wrote to the Socialist Party of\r\nAmerica, professing his belief in Marxism.\r\n\r\nAnother move followed in July 1956 when Lee and his mother returned\r\nto Fort Worth. He reentered high school but again dropped out after\r\na few weeks and enlisted in the Marine Corps on October 24, 1956, 6\r\ndays after his 17th birthday. On December 21, 1956, during boot camp\r\nin San Diego, Oswald fired a score of 212 for record with the M-1\r\nrifle--2 points over the minimum for a rating of “sharpshooter” on a\r\nmarksman/sharpshooter/expert scale. After his basic training, Oswald\r\nreceived training in aviation fundamentals and then in radar scanning.\r\n\r\nMost people who knew Oswald in the Marines described him as a “loner”\r\nwho resented the exercise of authority by others. He spent much of\r\nhis free time reading. He was court-martialed once for possessing an\r\nunregistered privately owned weapon and, on another occasion, for using\r\nprovocative language to a noncommissioned officer. He was, however,\r\ngenerally able to comply with Marine discipline, even though his\r\nexperiences in the Marine Corps did not live up to his expectations.\r\n\r\nOswald served 15 months overseas until November 1958, most of it in\r\nJapan. During his final year in the Marine Corps he was stationed for\r\nthe most part in Santa Ana, Calif., where he showed a marked interest\r\nin the Soviet Union and sometimes expressed politically radical views\r\nwith dogmatic conviction. Oswald again fired the M-1 rifle for record\r\non May 6, 1959, and this time he shot a score of 191 on a shorter\r\ncourse than before, only 1 point over the minimum required to be a\r\n“marksman.” According to one of his fellow marines, Oswald was not\r\nparticularly interested in his rifle performance, and his unit was not\r\nexpected to exhibit the usual rifle proficiency. During this period\r\nhe expressed strong admiration for Fidel Castro and an interest in\r\njoining the Cuban army. He tried to impress those around him as an\r\nintellectual, but his thinking appeared to some as shallow and rigid.\r\n\r\nOswald’s Marine service terminated on September 11, 1959, when at his\r\nown request he was released from active service a few months ahead\r\nof his scheduled release. He offered as the reason for his release\r\nthe ill health and economic plight of his mother. He returned to Fort\r\nWorth, remained with his mother only 3 days and left for New Orleans,\r\ntelling his mother he planned to get work there in the shipping or\r\nimport-export business. In New Orleans he booked passage on the\r\nfreighter SS _Marion Lykes_, which sailed from New Orleans to Le Havre,\r\nFrance, on September 20, 1959.\r\n\r\nLee Harvey Oswald had presumably planned this step in his life for\r\nquite some time. In March of 1959 he had applied to the Albert\r\nSchweitzer College in Switzerland for admission to the spring 1960\r\nterm. His letter of application contained many blatant falsehoods\r\nconcerning his qualifications and background. A few weeks before his\r\ndischarge he had applied for and obtained a passport, listing the\r\nSoviet Union as one of the countries which he planned to visit. During\r\nhis service in the Marines he had saved a comparatively large sum of\r\nmoney, possibly as much as $1,500, which would appear to have been\r\naccomplished by considerable frugality and apparently for a specific\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accumulated fund soon became known. On October 16,\r\n1959, Oswald arrived in Moscow by train after crossing the border\r\nfrom Finland, where he had secured a visa for a 6-day stay in the\r\nSoviet Union. He immediately applied for Soviet citizenship. On the\r\nafternoon of October 21, 1959, Oswald was ordered to leave the Soviet\r\nUnion by 8 p.m. that evening. That same afternoon in his hotel room\r\nOswald, in an apparent suicide attempt, slashed his left wrist. He\r\nwas hospitalized immediately. On October 31, 3 days after his release\r\nfrom the hospital, Oswald appeared at the American Embassy, announced\r\nthat he wished to renounce his U.S. citizenship and become a Russian\r\ncitizen, and handed the Embassy officer a written statement he had\r\nprepared for the occasion. When asked his reasons, Oswald replied, “I\r\nam a Marxist.” Oswald never formally complied with the legal steps\r\nnecessary to renounce his American citizenship. The Soviet Government\r\ndid not grant his request for citizenship, but in January 1960 he was\r\ngiven permission to remain in the Soviet Union on a year-to-year basis.\r\nAt the same time Oswald was sent to Minsk where he worked in a radio\r\nfactory as an unskilled laborer. In January 1961 his permission to\r\nremain in the Soviet Union was extended for another year. A few weeks\r\nlater, in February 1961, he wrote to the American Embassy in Moscow\r\nexpressing a desire to return to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe following month Oswald met a 19-year-old Russian girl, Marina\r\nNikolaevna Prusakova, a pharmacist, who had been brought up in\r\nLeningrad but was then living with an aunt and uncle in Minsk. They\r\nwere married on April 30, 1961. Throughout the following year he\r\ncarried on a correspondence with American and Soviet authorities\r\nseeking approval for the departure of himself and his wife to the\r\nUnited States. In the course of this effort, Oswald and his wife\r\nvisited the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in July of 1961. Primarily on the\r\nbasis of an interview and questionnaire completed there, the Embassy\r\nconcluded that Oswald had not lost his citizenship, a decision\r\nsubsequently ratified by the Department of State in Washington, D.C.\r\nUpon their return to Minsk, Oswald and his wife filed with the Soviet\r\nauthorities for permission to leave together. Their formal application\r\nwas made in July 1961, and on December 25, 1961, Marina Oswald was\r\nadvised it would be granted.\r\n\r\nA daughter was born to the Oswalds in February 1962. In the months that\r\nfollowed they prepared for their return to the United States. On May 9,\r\n1962, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, at the request\r\nof the Department of State, agreed to waive a restriction under the\r\nlaw which would have prevented the issuance of a United States visa to\r\nOswald’s Russian wife until she had left the Soviet Union. They finally\r\nleft Moscow on June 1, 1962, and were assisted in meeting their travel\r\nexpenses by a loan of $435.71 from the U.S. Department of State. Two\r\nweeks later they arrived in Fort Worth, Tex.\r\n\r\nFor a few weeks Oswald, his wife and child lived with Oswald’s brother\r\nRobert. After a similar stay with Oswald’s mother, they moved into\r\ntheir own apartment in early August. Oswald obtained a job on July\r\n16 as a sheet metal worker. During this period in Fort Worth, Oswald\r\nwas interviewed twice by agents of the FBI. The report of the first\r\ninterview, which occurred on June 26, described him as arrogant and\r\nunwilling to discuss the reasons why he had gone to the Soviet Union.\r\nOswald denied that he was involved in Soviet intelligence activities\r\nand promised to advise the FBI if Soviet representatives ever\r\ncommunicated with him. He was interviewed again on August 16, when he\r\ndisplayed a less belligerent attitude and once again agreed to inform\r\nthe FBI of any attempt to enlist him in intelligence activities.\r\n\r\nIn early October 1962 Oswald quit his job at the sheet metal plant\r\nand moved to Dallas. While living in Forth Worth the Oswalds had been\r\nintroduced to a group of Russian-speaking people in the Dallas-Fort\r\nWorth area. Many of them assisted the Oswalds by providing small\r\namounts of food, clothing, and household items. Oswald himself was\r\ndisliked by almost all of this group whose help to the family was\r\nprompted primarily by sympathy for Marina Oswald and the child.\r\nDespite the fact that he had left the Soviet Union, disillusioned\r\nwith its Government, Oswald seemed more firmly committed than ever to\r\nhis concepts of Marxism. He showed disdain for democracy, capitalism,\r\nand American society in general. He was highly critical of the\r\nRussian-speaking group because they seemed devoted to American concepts\r\nof democracy and capitalism and were ambitious to improve themselves\r\neconomically.\r\n\r\nIn February 1963 the Oswalds met Ruth Paine at a social gathering. Ruth\r\nPaine was temporarily separated from her husband and living with her\r\ntwo children in their home in Irving, Tex., a suburb of Dallas. Because\r\nof an interest in the Russian language and sympathy for Marina Oswald,\r\nwho spoke no English and had little funds, Ruth Paine befriended Marina\r\nand, during the next 2 months, visited her on several occasions.\r\n\r\nOn April 6, 1963, Oswald lost his job with a photography firm. A few\r\ndays later, on April 10, he attempted to kill Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker\r\n(Resigned, U.S. Army), using a rifle which he had ordered by mail 1\r\nmonth previously under an assumed name. Marina Oswald learned of her\r\nhusband’s act when she confronted him with a note which he had left,\r\ngiving her instructions in the event he did not return. That incident\r\nand their general economic difficulties impelled Marina Oswald to\r\nsuggest that her husband leave Dallas and go to New Orleans to look for\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nOswald left for New Orleans on April 24, 1963. Ruth Paine, who knew\r\nnothing of the Walker shooting, invited Marina Oswald and the baby to\r\nstay with her in the Paines’ modest home while Oswald sought work in\r\nNew Orleans. Early in May, upon receiving word from Oswald that he had\r\nfound a job, Ruth Paine drove Marina Oswald and the baby to New Orleans\r\nto rejoin Oswald.\r\n\r\nDuring the stay in New Orleans, Oswald formed a fictitious New Orleans\r\nChapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. He posed as secretary of\r\nthis organization and represented that the president was A. J. Hidell.\r\nIn reality, Hidell was a completely fictitious person created by\r\nOswald, the organization’s only member. Oswald was arrested on August 9\r\nin connection with a scuffle which occurred while he was distributing\r\npro-Castro leaflets. The next day, while at the police station, he\r\nwas interviewed by an FBI agent after Oswald requested the police to\r\narrange such an interview. Oswald gave the agent false information\r\nabout his own background and was evasive in his replies concerning Fair\r\nPlay for Cuba activities. During the next 2 weeks Oswald appeared on\r\nradio programs twice, claiming to be the spokesman for the Fair Play\r\nfor Cuba Committee in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nOn July 19, 1963, Oswald lost his job as a greaser of coffee processing\r\nmachinery. In September, after an exchange of correspondence with\r\nMarina Oswald, Ruth Paine drove to New Orleans and on September 23,\r\ntransported Marina, the child, and the family belongings to Irving,\r\nTex. Ruth Paine suggested that Marina Oswald, who was expecting her\r\nsecond child in October, live at the Paine house until after the baby\r\nwas born. Oswald remained behind, ostensibly to find work either in\r\nHouston or some other city. Instead, he departed by bus for Mexico,\r\narriving in Mexico City on September 27, where he promptly visited\r\nthe Cuban and Russian Embassies. His stated objective was to obtain\r\nofficial permission to visit Cuba, on his way to the Soviet Union. The\r\nCuban Government would not grant his visa unless the Soviet Government\r\nwould also issue a visa permitting his entry into Russia. Oswald’s\r\nefforts to secure these visas failed, and he left for Dallas, where he\r\narrived on October 3, 1963.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw his wife the next day, it was decided that Oswald would\r\nrent a room in Dallas and visit his family on weekends. For 1 week he\r\nrented a room from Mrs. Bledsoe, the woman who later saw him on the bus\r\nshortly after the assassination. On October 14, 1963, he rented the\r\nBeckley Avenue room and listed his name as O. H. Lee. On the same day,\r\nat the suggestion of a neighbor, Mrs. Paine phoned the Texas School\r\nBook Depository and was told that there was a job opening. She informed\r\nOswald who was interviewed the following day at the Depository and\r\nstarted to work there on October 16, 1963.\r\n\r\nOn October 20 the Oswalds’ second daughter was born. During October\r\nand November Oswald established a general pattern of weekend visits to\r\nIrving, arriving on Friday afternoon and returning to Dallas Monday\r\nmorning with a fellow employee, Buell Wesley Frazier, who lived near\r\nthe Paines. On Friday, November 15, Oswald remained in Dallas at the\r\nsuggestion of his wife who told him that the house would be crowded\r\nbecause of a birthday party for Ruth Paine’s daughter. On Monday,\r\nNovember 18, Oswald and his wife quarreled bitterly during a telephone\r\nconversation, because she learned for the first time that he was living\r\nat the roominghouse under an assumed name. On Thursday, November 21,\r\nOswald told Frazier that he would like to drive to Irving to pick up\r\nsome curtain rods for an apartment in Dallas. His wife and Mrs. Paine\r\nwere quite surprised to see him since it was a Thursday night. They\r\nthought he had returned to make up after Monday’s quarrel. He was\r\nconciliatory, but Marina Oswald was still angry.\r\n\r\nLater that evening, when Mrs. Paine had finished cleaning the kitchen,\r\nshe went into the garage and noticed that the light was burning. She\r\nwas certain that she had not left it on, although the incident appeared\r\nunimportant at the time. In the garage were most of the Oswalds’\r\npersonal possessions. The following morning Oswald left while his wife\r\nwas still in bed feeding the baby. She did not see him leave the house,\r\nnor did Ruth Paine. On the dresser in their room he left his wedding\r\nring which he had never done before. His wallet containing $170 was\r\nleft intact in a dresser-drawer.\r\n\r\nOswald walked to Frazier’s house about half a block away and placed a\r\nlong bulky package, made out of wrapping paper and tape, into the rear\r\nseat of the car. He told Frazier that the package contained curtain\r\nrods. When they reached the Depository parking lot, Oswald walked\r\nquickly ahead. Frazier followed and saw Oswald enter the Depository\r\nBuilding carrying the long bulky package with him.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning of November 22, Marina Oswald followed President\r\nKennedy’s activities on television. She and Ruth Paine cried when they\r\nheard that the President had been shot. Ruth Paine translated the news\r\nof the shooting to Marina Oswald as it came over television, including\r\nthe report that the shots were probably fired from the building where\r\nOswald worked. When Marina Oswald heard this, she recalled the Walker\r\nepisode and the fact that her husband still owned the rifle. She went\r\nquietly to the Paine’s garage where the rifle had been concealed in a\r\nblanket among their other belongings. It appeared to her that the rifle\r\nwas still there, although she did not actually open the blanket.\r\n\r\nAt about 3 p.m. the police arrived at the Paine house and asked Marina\r\nOswald whether her husband owned a rifle. She said that he did and then\r\nled them into the garage and pointed to the rolled up blanket. As a\r\npolice officer lifted it, the blanket hung limply over either side of\r\nhis arm. The rifle was not there.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at police headquarters, Captain Fritz had begun questioning\r\nOswald. Soon after the start of the first interrogation, agents of\r\nthe FBI and the U.S. Secret Service arrived and participated in the\r\nquestioning. Oswald denied having anything to do with the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy or the murder of Patrolman Tippit. He claimed that\r\nhe was eating lunch at the time of the assassination, and that he then\r\nspoke with his foreman for 5 to 10 minutes before going home. He denied\r\nthat he owned a rifle and when confronted, in a subsequent interview,\r\nwith a picture showing him holding a rifle and pistol, he claimed that\r\nhis face had been superimposed on someone else’s body. He refused to\r\nanswer any questions about the presence in his wallet of a selective\r\nservice card with his picture and the name “Alek J. Hidell.”\r\n\r\nDuring the questioning of Oswald on the third floor of the police\r\ndepartment, more than 100 representatives of the press, radio, and\r\ntelevision were crowded into the hallway through which Oswald had\r\nto pass when being taken from his cell to Captain Fritz’ office for\r\ninterrogation. Reporters tried to interview Oswald during these\r\ntrips. Between Friday afternoon and Sunday morning he appeared in the\r\nhallway at least 16 times. The generally confused conditions outside\r\nand inside Captain Fritz’ office increased the difficulty of police\r\nquestioning. Advised by the police that he could communicate with an\r\nattorney, Oswald made several telephone calls on Saturday in an effort\r\nto procure representation of his own choice and discussed the matter\r\nwith the president of the local bar association, who offered to obtain\r\ncounsel. Oswald declined the offer saying that he would first try to\r\nobtain counsel by himself. By Sunday morning he had not yet engaged an\r\nattorney.\r\n\r\nAt 7:10 p.m. on November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald was formally\r\nadvised that he had been charged with the murder of Patrolman J.D.\r\nTippit. Several witnesses to the Tippit slaying and to the subsequent\r\nflight of the gunman had positively identified Oswald in police\r\nlineups. While positive firearm identification evidence was not\r\navailable at the time, the revolver in Oswald’s possession at the time\r\nof his arrest was of a type which could have fired the shots that\r\nkilled Tippit.\r\n\r\nThe formal charge against Oswald for the assassination of President\r\nKennedy was lodged shortly after 1:30 a.m., on Saturday, November 23.\r\nBy 10 p.m. of the day of the assassination, the FBI had traced the\r\nrifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository to\r\na mailorder house in Chicago which had purchased it from a distributor\r\nin New York. Approximately 6 hours later the Chicago firm advised\r\nthat this rifle had been ordered in March 1963 by an A. Hidel for\r\nshipment to post office box 2915, in Dallas, Tex., a box rented by\r\nOswald. Payment for the rifle was remitted by a money order signed by\r\nA. Hidell. By 6:45 p.m. on November 23, the FBI was able to advise\r\nthe Dallas police that, as a result of handwriting analysis of the\r\ndocuments used to purchase the rifle, it had concluded that the rifle\r\nhad been ordered by Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nThroughout Friday and Saturday, the Dallas police released to the\r\npublic many of the details concerning the alleged evidence against\r\nOswald. Police officials discussed important aspects of the case,\r\nusually in the course of impromptu and confused press conferences\r\nin the third-floor corridor. Some of the information divulged was\r\nerroneous. Efforts by the news media representatives to reconstruct the\r\ncrime and promptly report details frequently led to erroneous and often\r\nconflicting reports. At the urgings of the newsmen, Chief of Police\r\nJesse E. Curry, brought Oswald to a press conference in the police\r\nassembly room shortly after midnight of the day Oswald was arrested.\r\nThe assembly room was crowded with newsmen who had come to Dallas from\r\nall over the country. They shouted questions at Oswald and flashed\r\ncameras at him. Among this group was a 52-year-old Dallas nightclub\r\noperator--Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, November 24, arrangements were made for Oswald’s\r\ntransfer from the city jail to the Dallas County jail, about 1 mile\r\naway. The news media had been informed on Saturday night that the\r\ntransfer of Oswald would not take place until after 10 a.m. on Sunday.\r\nEarlier on Sunday, between 2:30 and 3 a.m., anonymous telephone calls\r\nthreatening Oswald’s life had been received by the Dallas office of the\r\nFBI and by the office of the county sheriff. Nevertheless, on Sunday\r\nmorning, television, radio, and newspaper representatives crowded into\r\nthe basement to record the transfer. As viewed through television\r\ncameras, Oswald would emerge from a door in front of the cameras and\r\nproceed to the transfer vehicle. To the right of the cameras was a\r\n“down” ramp from Main Street on the north. To the left was an “up” ramp\r\nleading to Commerce Street on the south.\r\n\r\nThe armored truck in which Oswald was to be transferred arrived shortly\r\nafter 11 a.m. Police officials then decided, however, that an unmarked\r\npolice car would be preferable for the trip because of its greater\r\nspeed and maneuverability. At approximately 11:20 a.m. Oswald emerged\r\nfrom the basement jail office flanked by detectives on either side and\r\nat his rear. He took a few steps toward the car and was in the glaring\r\nlight of the television cameras when a man suddenly darted out from\r\nan area on the right of the cameras where newsmen had been assembled.\r\nThe man was carrying a Colt .38 revolver in his right hand and, while\r\nmillions watched on television, he moved quickly to within a few feet\r\nof Oswald and fired one shot into Oswald’s abdomen. Oswald groaned with\r\npain as he fell to the ground and quickly lost consciousness. Within 7\r\nminutes Oswald was at Parkland Hospital where, without having regained\r\nconsciousness, he was pronounced dead at 1:07 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe man who killed Oswald was Jack Ruby. He was instantly arrested and,\r\nminutes later, confined in a cell on the fifth floor of the Dallas\r\npolice jail. Under interrogation, he denied that the killing of Oswald\r\nwas in any way connected with a conspiracy involving the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy. He maintained that he had killed Oswald in a\r\ntemporary fit of depression and rage over the President’s death. Ruby\r\nwas transferred the following day to the county jail without notice to\r\nthe press or to police officers not directly involved in the transfer.\r\nIndicted for the murder of Oswald by the State of Texas on November 26,\r\n1963, Ruby was found guilty on March 14, 1964, and sentenced to death.\r\nAs of September 1964, his case was pending on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThis Commission was created to ascertain the facts relating to the\r\npreceding summary of events and to consider the important questions\r\nwhich they raised. The Commission has addressed itself to this task and\r\nhas reached certain conclusions based on all the available evidence.\r\nNo limitations have been placed on the Commission’s inquiry; it has\r\nconducted its own investigation, and all Government agencies have fully\r\ndischarged their responsibility to cooperate with the Commission in its\r\ninvestigation. These conclusions represent the reasoned judgment of\r\nall members of the Commission and are presented after an investigation\r\nwhich has satisfied the Commission that it has ascertained the truth\r\nconcerning the assassination of President Kennedy to the extent that a\r\nprolonged and thorough search makes this possible.\r\n\r\n1. The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor\r\nConnally were fired from the sixth floor window at the southeast corner\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository. This determination is based upon\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Witnesses at the scene of the assassination saw a rifle\r\n    being fired from the sixth floor window of the Depository\r\n    Building, and some witnesses saw a rifle in the window\r\n    immediately after the shots were fired.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The nearly whole bullet found on Governor Connally’s\r\n    stretcher at Parkland Memorial Hospital and the two bullet\r\n    fragments found in the front seat of the Presidential limousine\r\n    were fired from the 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano rifle\r\n    found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building to the\r\n    exclusion of all other weapons.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The three used cartridge cases found near the window on\r\n    the sixth floor at the southeast corner of the building were\r\n    fired from the same rifle which fired the above-described\r\n    bullet and fragments, to the exclusion of all other weapons.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) The windshield in the Presidential limousine was struck\r\n    by a bullet fragment on the inside surface of the glass, but\r\n    was not penetrated.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) The nature of the bullet wounds suffered by President\r\n    Kennedy and Governor Connally and the location of the car at\r\n    the time of the shots establish that the bullets were fired\r\n    from above and behind the Presidential limousine, striking the\r\n    President and the Governor as follows:\r\n\r\n    (1) President Kennedy was first struck by a bullet which\r\n    entered at the back of his neck and exited through the lower\r\n    front portion of his neck, causing a wound which would not\r\n    necessarily have been lethal. The President was struck a second\r\n    time by a bullet which entered the right-rear portion of his\r\n    head, causing a massive and fatal wound.\r\n\r\n    (2) Governor Connally was struck by a bullet which entered on\r\n    the right side of his back and traveled downward through the\r\n    right side of his chest, exiting below his right nipple. This\r\n    bullet then passed through his right wrist and entered his left\r\n    thigh where it caused a superficial wound.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) There is no credible evidence that the shots were fired\r\n    from the Triple Underpass, ahead of the motorcade, or from any\r\n    other location.\r\n\r\n2. The weight of the evidence indicates that there were three shots\r\nfired.\r\n\r\n3. Although it is not necessary to any essential findings of the\r\nCommission to determine just which shot hit Governor Connally, there\r\nis very persuasive evidence from the experts to indicate that the\r\nsame bullet which pierced the President’s throat also caused Governor\r\nConnally’s wounds. However, Governor Connally’s testimony and certain\r\nother factors have given rise to some difference of opinion as to this\r\nprobability but there is no question in the mind of any member of the\r\nCommission that all the shots which caused the President’s and Governor\r\nConnally’s wounds were fired from the sixth floor window of the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository.\r\n\r\n4. The shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor\r\nConnally were fired by Lee Harvey Oswald. This conclusion is based upon\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter Italian rifle from\r\n    which the shots were fired was owned by and in the possession\r\n    of Oswald.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Oswald carried this rifle into the Depository Building on\r\n    the morning of November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Oswald, at the time of the assassination, was present at\r\n    the window from which the shots were fired.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) Shortly after the assassination, the Mannlicher-Carcano\r\n    rifle belonging to Oswald was found partially hidden between\r\n    some cartons on the sixth floor and the improvised paper bag\r\n    in which Oswald brought the rifle to the Depository was found\r\n    close by the window from which the shots were fired.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) Based on testimony of the experts and their analysis of\r\n    films of the assassination, the Commission has concluded that a\r\n    rifleman of Lee Harvey Oswald’s capabilities could have fired\r\n    the shots from the rifle used in the assassination within the\r\n    elapsed time of the shooting. The Commission has concluded\r\n    further that Oswald possessed the capability with a rifle\r\n    which enabled him to commit the assassination.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) Oswald lied to the police after his arrest concerning\r\n    important substantive matters.\r\n\r\n    (_g_) Oswald had attempted to kill Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker\r\n    (Resigned, U. S. Army) on April 10, 1963, thereby demonstrating\r\n    his disposition to take human life.\r\n\r\n5. Oswald killed Dallas Police Patrolman J. D. Tippit approximately 45\r\nminutes after the assassination. This conclusion upholds the finding\r\nthat Oswald fired the shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded\r\nGovernor Connally and is supported by the following:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Two eyewitnesses saw the Tippit shooting and seven\r\n    eyewitnesses heard the shots and saw the gunman leave the scene\r\n    with revolver in hand. These nine eyewitnesses positively\r\n    identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man they saw.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The cartridge cases found at the scene of the shooting\r\n    were fired from the revolver in the possession of Oswald at the\r\n    time of his arrest to the exclusion of all other weapons.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The revolver in Oswald’s possession at the time of his\r\n    arrest was purchased by and belonged to Oswald.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) Oswald’s jacket was found along the path of flight taken\r\n    by the gunman as he fled from the scene of the killing.\r\n\r\n6. Within 80 minutes of the assassination and 35 minutes of the Tippit\r\nkilling Oswald resisted arrest at the theatre by attempting to shoot\r\nanother Dallas police officer.\r\n\r\n7. The Commission has reached the following conclusions concerning\r\nOswald’s interrogation and detention by the Dallas police:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Except for the force required to effect his arrest,\r\n    Oswald was not subjected to any physical coercion by any law\r\n    enforcement officials. He was advised that he could not be\r\n    compelled to give any information and that any statements made\r\n    by him might be used against him in court. He was advised of\r\n    his right to counsel. He was given the opportunity to obtain\r\n    counsel of his own choice and was offered legal assistance by\r\n    the Dallas Bar Association, which he rejected at that time.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Newspaper, radio, and television reporters were allowed\r\n    uninhibited access to the area through which Oswald had to\r\n    pass when he was moved from his cell to the interrogation room\r\n    and other sections of the building, thereby subjecting Oswald\r\n    to harassment and creating chaotic conditions which were not\r\n    conducive to orderly interrogation or the protection of the\r\n    rights of the prisoner.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The numerous statements, sometimes erroneous, made to\r\n    the press by various local law enforcement officials, during\r\n    this period of confusion and disorder in the police station,\r\n    would have presented serious obstacles to the obtaining of\r\n    a fair trial for Oswald. To the extent that the information\r\n    was erroneous or misleading, it helped to create doubts,\r\n    speculations, and fears in the mind of the public which might\r\n    otherwise not have arisen.\r\n\r\n8. The Commission has reached the following conclusions concerning the\r\nkilling of Oswald by Jack Ruby on November 24, 1963:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Ruby entered the basement of the Dallas Police Department\r\n    shortly after 11:17 a.m. and killed Lee Harvey Oswald at 11:21\r\n    a.m.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Although the evidence on Ruby’s means of entry is not\r\n    conclusive, the weight of the evidence indicates that he walked\r\n    down the ramp leading from Main Street to the basement of the\r\n    police department.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) There is no evidence to support the rumor that Ruby\r\n    may have been assisted by any members of the Dallas Police\r\n    Department in the killing of Oswald.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) The Dallas Police Department’s decision to transfer\r\n    Oswald to the county jail in full public view was unsound.\r\n    The arrangements made by the police department on Sunday\r\n    morning, only a few hours before the attempted transfer, were\r\n    inadequate. Of critical importance was the fact that news media\r\n    representatives and others were not excluded from the basement\r\n    even after the police were notified of threats to Oswald’s\r\n    life. These deficiencies contributed to the death of Lee Harvey\r\n    Oswald.\r\n\r\n9. The Commission has found no evidence that either Lee Harvey Oswald\r\nor Jack Ruby was part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign, to\r\nassassinate President Kennedy. The reasons for this conclusion are:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The Commission has found no evidence that anyone assisted\r\n    Oswald in planning or carrying out the assassination. In this\r\n    connection it has thoroughly investigated, among other factors,\r\n    the circumstances surrounding the planning of the motorcade\r\n    route through Dallas, the hiring of Oswald by the Texas School\r\n    Book Depository Co. on October 15, 1963, the method by which\r\n    the rifle was brought into the building, the placing of cartons\r\n    of books at the window, Oswald’s escape from the building, and\r\n    the testimony of eyewitnesses to the shooting.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The Commission has found no evidence that Oswald\r\n    was involved with any person or group in a conspiracy to\r\n    assassinate the President, although it has thoroughly\r\n    investigated, in addition to other possible leads, all facets\r\n    of Oswald’s associations, finances, and personal habits,\r\n    particularly during the period following his return from the\r\n    Soviet Union in June 1962.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The Commission has found no evidence to show that\r\n    Oswald was employed, persuaded, or encouraged by any foreign\r\n    government to assassinate President Kennedy or that he was an\r\n    agent of any foreign government, although the Commission has\r\n    reviewed the circumstances surrounding Oswald’s defection to\r\n    the Soviet Union, his life there from October of 1959 to June\r\n    of 1962 so far as it can be reconstructed, his known contacts\r\n    with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and his visits to the\r\n    Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City during his trip to\r\n    Mexico from September 26 to October 3, 1963, and his known\r\n    contacts with the Soviet Embassy in the United States.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) The Commission has explored all attempts of Oswald to\r\n    identify himself with various political groups, including the\r\n    Communist Party, U. S. A., the Fair Play for Cuba Committee,\r\n    and the Socialist Workers Party, and has been unable to find\r\n    any evidence that the contacts which he initiated were related\r\n    to Oswald’s subsequent assassination of the President.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) All of the evidence before the Commission established\r\n    that there was nothing to support the speculation that Oswald\r\n    was an agent, employee, or informant of the FBI, the CIA, or\r\n    any other governmental agency. It has thoroughly investigated\r\n    Oswald’s relationships prior to the assassination with all\r\n    agencies of the U. S. Government. All contacts with Oswald by\r\n    any of these agencies were made in the regular exercise of\r\n    their different responsibilities.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) No direct or indirect relationship between Lee Harvey\r\n    Oswald and Jack Ruby has been discovered by the Commission, nor\r\n    has it been able to find any credible evidence that either knew\r\n    the other, although a thorough investigation was made of the\r\n    many rumors and speculations of such a relationship.\r\n\r\n    (_g_) The Commission has found no evidence that Jack Ruby acted\r\n    with any other person in the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\n    (_h_) After careful investigation the Commission has found no\r\n    credible evidence either that Ruby and Officer Tippit, who was\r\n    killed by Oswald, knew each other or that Oswald and Tippit\r\n    knew each other.\r\n\r\n    Because of the difficulty of proving negatives to a certainty\r\n    the possibility of others being involved with either Oswald\r\n    or Ruby cannot be established categorically, but if there is\r\n    any such evidence it has been beyond the reach of all the\r\n    investigative agencies and resources of the United States and\r\n    has not come to the attention of this Commission.\r\n\r\n10. In its entire investigation the Commission has found no evidence of\r\nconspiracy, subversion, or disloyalty to the U. S. Government by any\r\nFederal, State, or local official.\r\n\r\n11. On the basis of the evidence before the Commission it concludes\r\nthat Oswald acted alone. Therefore, to determine the motives for the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy, one must look to the assassin\r\nhimself. Clues to Oswald’s motives can be found in his family\r\nhistory, his education or lack of it, his acts, his writings, and the\r\nrecollections of those who had close contacts with him throughout\r\nhis life. The Commission has presented with this report all of the\r\nbackground information bearing on motivation which it could discover.\r\nThus, others may study Lee Oswald’s life and arrive at their own\r\nconclusions as to his possible motives.\r\n\r\nThe Commission could not make any definitive determination of Oswald’s\r\nmotives. It has endeavored to isolate factors which contributed to his\r\ncharacter and which might have influenced his decision to assassinate\r\nPresident Kennedy. These factors were:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) His deep-rooted resentment of all authority which was\r\n    expressed in a hostility toward every society in which he lived;\r\n\r\n    (_b_) His inability to enter into meaningful relationships with\r\n    people, and a continuous pattern of rejecting his environment\r\n    in favor of new surroundings;\r\n\r\n    (_c_) His urge to try to find a place in history and despair at\r\n    times over failures in his various undertakings;\r\n\r\n    (_d_) His capacity for violence as evidenced by his attempt to\r\n    kill General Walker;\r\n\r\n    (_e_) His avowed commitment to Marxism and communism, as he\r\n    understood the terms and developed his own interpretation of\r\n    them; this was expressed by his antagonism toward the United\r\n    States, by his defection to the Soviet Union, by his failure\r\n    to be reconciled with life in the United States even after\r\n    his disenchantment with the Soviet Union, and by his efforts,\r\n    though frustrated, to go to Cuba.\r\n\r\nEach of these contributed to his capacity to risk all in cruel and\r\nirresponsible actions.\r\n\r\n12. The Commission recognizes that the varied responsibilities of the\r\nPresident require that he make frequent trips to all parts of the\r\nUnited States and abroad. Consistent with their high responsibilities\r\nPresidents can never be protected from every potential threat. The\r\nSecret Service’s difficulty in meeting its protective responsibility\r\nvaries with the activities and the nature of the occupant of the\r\nOffice of President and his willingness to conform to plans for his\r\nsafety. In appraising the performance of the Secret Service it should\r\nbe understood that it has to do its work within such limitations.\r\nNevertheless, the Commission believes that recommendations for\r\nimprovements in Presidential protection are compelled by the facts\r\ndisclosed in this investigation.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The complexities of the Presidency have increased so\r\n    rapidly in recent years that the Secret Service has not been\r\n    able to develop or to secure adequate resources of personnel\r\n    and facilities to fulfill its important assignment. This\r\n    situation should be promptly remedied.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The Commission has concluded that the criteria and\r\n    procedures of the Secret Service designed to identify and\r\n    protect against persons considered threats to the president,\r\n    were not adequate prior to the assassination.\r\n\r\n    (1) The Protective Research Section of the Secret Service,\r\n    which is responsible for its preventive work, lacked sufficient\r\n    trained personnel and the mechanical and technical assistance\r\n    needed to fulfill its responsibility.\r\n\r\n    (2) Prior to the assassination the Secret Service’s criteria\r\n    dealt with direct threats against the President. Although the\r\n    Secret Service treated the direct threats against the President\r\n    adequately, it failed to recognize the necessity of identifying\r\n    other potential sources of danger to his security. The Secret\r\n    Service did not develop adequate and specific criteria defining\r\n    those persons or groups who might present a danger to the\r\n    President. In effect, the Secret Service largely relied upon\r\n    other Federal or State agencies to supply the information\r\n    necessary for it to fulfill its preventive responsibilities,\r\n    although it did ask for information about direct threats to the\r\n    President.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The Commission has concluded that there was insufficient\r\n    liaison and coordination of information between the Secret\r\n    Service and other Federal agencies necessarily concerned with\r\n    Presidential protection. Although the FBI, in the normal\r\n    exercise of its responsibility, had secured considerable\r\n    information about Lee Harvey Oswald, it had no official\r\n    responsibility, under the Secret Service criteria existing\r\n    at the time of the President’s trip to Dallas, to refer to\r\n    the Secret Service the information it had about Oswald. The\r\n    Commission has concluded, however, that the FBI took an unduly\r\n    restrictive view of its role in preventive intelligence work\r\n    prior to the assassination. A more carefully coordinated\r\n    treatment of the Oswald case by the FBI might well have\r\n    resulted in bringing Oswald’s activities to the attention of\r\n    the Secret Service.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) The Commission has concluded that some of the advance\r\n    preparations in Dallas made by the Secret Service, such as the\r\n    detailed security measures taken at Love Field and the Trade\r\n    Mart, were thorough and well executed. In other respects,\r\n    however, the Commission has concluded that the advance\r\n    preparations for the President’s trip were deficient.\r\n\r\n    (1) Although the Secret Service is compelled to rely to a great\r\n    extent on local law enforcement officials, its procedures at\r\n    the time of the Dallas trip did not call for well-defined\r\n    instructions as to the respective responsibilities of the\r\n    police officials and others assisting in the protection of the\r\n    President.\r\n\r\n    (2) The procedures relied upon by the Secret Service for\r\n    detecting the presence of an assassin located in a building\r\n    along a motorcade route were inadequate. At the time of the\r\n    trip to Dallas, the Secret Service as a matter of practice did\r\n    not investigate, or cause to be checked, any building located\r\n    along the motorcade route to be taken by the President. The\r\n    responsibility for observing windows in these buildings during\r\n    the motorcade was divided between local police personnel\r\n    stationed on the streets to regulate crowds and Secret Service\r\n    agents riding in the motorcade. Based on its investigation the\r\n    Commission has concluded that these arrangements during the\r\n    trip to Dallas were clearly not sufficient.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) The configuration of the Presidential car and the seating\r\n    arrangements of the Secret Service agents in the car did not\r\n    afford the Secret Service agents the opportunity they should\r\n    have had to be of immediate assistance to the President at the\r\n    first sign of danger.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) Within these limitations, however, the Commission\r\n    finds that the agents most immediately responsible for the\r\n    President’s safety reacted promptly at the time the shots were\r\n    fired from the Texas School Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS\r\n\r\nPrompted by the assassination of President Kennedy, the Secret Service\r\nhas initiated a comprehensive and critical review of its total\r\noperations. As a result of studies conducted during the past several\r\nmonths, and in cooperation with this Commission, the Secret Service has\r\nprepared a planning document dated August 27, 1964, which recommends\r\nvarious programs considered necessary by the Service to improve its\r\ntechniques and enlarge its resources. The Commission is encouraged by\r\nthe efforts taken by the Secret Service since the assassination and\r\nsuggests the following recommendations.\r\n\r\n1. A committee of Cabinet members including the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury and the Attorney General, or the National Security Council,\r\nshould be assigned the responsibility of reviewing and overseeing the\r\nprotective activities of the Secret Service and the other Federal\r\nagencies that assist in safeguarding the President. Once given this\r\nresponsibility, such a committee would insure that the maximum\r\nresources of the Federal Government are fully engaged in the task of\r\nprotecting the President, and would provide guidance in defining the\r\ngeneral nature of domestic and foreign dangers to Presidential security.\r\n\r\n2. Suggestions have been advanced to the Commission for the transfer\r\nof all or parts of the Presidential protective responsibilities of\r\nthe Secret Service to some other department or agency. The Commission\r\nbelieves that if there is to be any determination of whether or not to\r\nrelocate these responsibilities and functions, it ought to be made by\r\nthe Executive and the Congress, perhaps upon recommendations based on\r\nstudies by the previously suggested committee.\r\n\r\n3. Meanwhile, in order to improve daily supervision of the Secret\r\nService within the Department of the Treasury, the Commission\r\nrecommends that the Secretary of the Treasury appoint a special\r\nassistant with the responsibility of supervising the Secret Service.\r\nThis special assistant should have sufficient stature and experience in\r\nlaw enforcement, intelligence, and allied fields to provide effective\r\ncontinuing supervision, and to keep the Secretary fully informed\r\nregarding the performance of the Secret Service. One of the initial\r\nassignments of this special assistant should be the supervision of the\r\ncurrent effort by the Secret Service to revise and modernize its basic\r\noperating procedures.\r\n\r\n4. The Commission recommends that the Secret Service completely\r\noverhaul its facilities devoted to the advance detection of potential\r\nthreats against the President. The Commission suggests the following\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The Secret Service should develop as quickly as possible\r\n    more useful and precise criteria defining those potential\r\n    threats to the President which should be brought to its\r\n    attention by other agencies. The criteria should, among other\r\n    additions, provide for prompt notice to the Secret Service of\r\n    all returned defectors.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The Secret Service should expedite its current plans to\r\n    utilize the most efficient data-processing techniques.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Once the Secret Service has formulated new criteria\r\n    delineating the information it desires, it should enter into\r\n    agreements with each Federal agency to insure its receipt of\r\n    such information.\r\n\r\n5. The Commission recommends that the Secret Service improve the\r\nprotective measures followed in the planning, and conducting of\r\nPresidential motorcades. In particular, the Secret Service should\r\ncontinue its current efforts to increase the precautionary attention\r\ngiven to buildings along the motorcade route.\r\n\r\n6. The Commission recommends that the Secret Service continue its\r\nrecent efforts to improve and formalize its relationships with local\r\npolice departments in areas to be visited by the President.\r\n\r\n7. The Commission believes that when the new criteria and procedures\r\nare established, the Secret Service will not have sufficient personnel\r\nor adequate facilities. The Commission recommends that the Secret\r\nService be provided with the personnel and resources which the Service\r\nand the Department of the Treasury may be able to demonstrate are\r\nneeded to fulfill its important mission.\r\n\r\n8. Even with an increase in Secret Service personnel, the protection of\r\nthe President will continue to require the resources and cooperation of\r\nmany Federal agencies. The Commission recommends that these agencies,\r\nspecifically the FBI, continue the practice as it has developed,\r\nparticularly since the assassination, of assisting the Secret Service\r\nupon request by providing personnel or other aid, and that there be\r\na closer association and liaison between the Secret Service and all\r\nFederal agencies.\r\n\r\n9. The Commission recommends that the President’s physician always\r\naccompany him during his travels and occupy a position near the\r\nPresident where he can be immediately available in case of any\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\n10. The Commission recommends to Congress that it adopt legislation\r\nwhich would make the assassination of the President and Vice President\r\na Federal crime. A state of affairs where U.S. authorities have no\r\nclearly defined jurisdiction to investigate the assassination of a\r\nPresident is anomalous.\r\n\r\n11. The Commission has examined the Department of State’s handling\r\nof the Oswald matters and finds that it followed the law throughout.\r\nHowever, the Commission believes that the Department in accordance\r\nwith its own regulations should in all cases exercise great care in\r\nthe return to this country of defectors who have evidenced disloyalty\r\nor hostility to this country or who have expressed a desire to\r\nrenounce their American citizenship and that when such persons are so\r\nreturned, procedures should be adopted for the better dissemination\r\nof information concerning them to the intelligence agencies of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n12. The Commission recommends that the representatives of the bar, law\r\nenforcement associations, and the news media work together to establish\r\nethical standards concerning the collection and presentation of\r\ninformation to the public so that there will be no interference with\r\npending criminal investigations, court proceedings, or the right of\r\nindividuals to a fair trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe Assassination\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter describes President Kennedy’s trip to Dallas, from its\r\norigin through its tragic conclusion. The narrative of these events\r\nis based largely on the recollections of the participants, although\r\nin many instances documentary or other evidence has also been used by\r\nthe Commission. Beginning with the advance plans and Secret Service\r\npreparations for the trip, this chapter reviews the motorcade through\r\nDallas, the fleeting moments of the assassination, the activities at\r\nParkland Memorial Hospital, and the return of the Presidential party to\r\nWashington. An evaluation of the procedures employed to safeguard the\r\nPresident, with recommendations for improving these procedures, appears\r\nin chapter VIII of the report.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNING THE TEXAS TRIP\r\n\r\nPresident Kennedy’s visit to Texas in November 1963 had been under\r\nconsideration for almost a year before it occurred. He had made\r\nonly a few brief visits to the State since the 1960 Presidential\r\ncampaign and in 1962 he began to consider a formal visit.[C2-1]\r\nDuring 1963, the reasons for making the trip became more persuasive.\r\nAs a political leader, the President wished to resolve the factional\r\ncontroversy within the Democratic Party in Texas before the election\r\nof 1964.[C2-2] The party itself saw an opportunity to raise funds by\r\nhaving the President speak at a political dinner eventually planned\r\nfor Austin.[C2-3] As Chief of State, the President always welcomed the\r\nopportunity to learn, firsthand, about the problems which concerned\r\nthe American people.[C2-4] Moreover, he looked forward to the public\r\nappearances which he personally enjoyed.[C2-5]\r\n\r\nThe basic decision on the November trip to Texas was made at a\r\nmeeting of President Kennedy, Vice President Johnson, and Governor\r\nConnally on June 5, 1963, at the Cortez Hotel in El Paso, Tex.[C2-6]\r\nThe President had spoken earlier that day at the Air Force Academy\r\nin Colorado Springs, Colo., and had stopped in El Paso to discuss\r\nthe proposed visit and other matters with the Vice President and the\r\nGovernor.[C2-7] The three agreed that the President would come to Texas\r\nin late November 1963.[C2-8] The original plan called for the President\r\nto spend only 1 day in the State, making whirlwind visits to Dallas,\r\nFort Worth, San Antonio, and Houston.[C2-9] In September, the White\r\nHouse decided to permit further visits by the President and extended\r\nthe trip to run from the afternoon of November 21 through the evening\r\nof Friday, November 22.[C2-10] When Governor Connally called at the\r\nWhite House on October 4 to discuss the details of the visit, it was\r\nagreed that the planning of events in Texas would be left largely to\r\nthe Governor.[C2-11] At the White House, Kenneth O’Donnell, special\r\nassistant to the President, acted as coordinator for the trip.[C2-12]\r\n\r\nEveryone agreed that, if there was sufficient time, a motorcade through\r\ndowntown Dallas would be the best way for the people to see their\r\nPresident. When the trip was planned for only 1 day, Governor Connally\r\nhad opposed the motorcade because there was not enough time.[C2-13]\r\nThe Governor stated, however, that “once we got San Antonio moved\r\nfrom Friday to Thursday afternoon, where that was his initial stop\r\nin Texas, then we had the time, and I withdrew my objections to\r\na motorcade.”[C2-14] According to O’Donnell, “we had a motorcade\r\nwherever we went,” particularly in large cities where the purpose was\r\nto let the President be seen by as many people as possible.[C2-15]\r\nIn his experience, “it would be automatic” for the Secret Service\r\nto arrange a route which would, within the time allotted, bring the\r\nPresident “through an area which exposes him to the greatest number of\r\npeople.”[C2-16]\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCE PREPARATIONS FOR THE DALLAS TRIP\r\n\r\nAdvance preparations for President Kennedy’s visit to Dallas were\r\nprimarily the responsibility of two Secret Service agents: Special\r\nAgent Winston G. Lawson, a member of the White House detail who acted\r\nas the advance agent, and Forrest V. Sorrels, special agent in charge\r\nof the Dallas office.[C2-17] Both agents were advised of the trip on\r\nNovember 4.[C2-18] Lawson received a tentative schedule of the Texas\r\ntrip on November 8 from Roy H. Kellerman, assistant special agent in\r\ncharge of the White House detail, who was the Secret Service official\r\nresponsible for the entire Texas journey.[C2-19] As advance agent\r\nworking closely with Sorrels, Lawson had responsibility for arranging\r\nthe timetable for the President’s visit to Dallas and coordinating\r\nlocal activities with the White House staff, the organizations directly\r\nconcerned with the visit, and local law enforcement officials.[C2-20]\r\nLawson’s most important responsibilities were to take preventive\r\naction against anyone in Dallas considered a threat to the President,\r\nto select the luncheon site and motorcade route, and to plan security\r\nmeasures for the luncheon and the motorcade.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreventive Intelligence Activities\r\n\r\nThe Protective Research Section (PRS) of the Secret Service maintains\r\nrecords of people who have threatened the President or so conducted\r\nthemselves as to be deemed a potential danger to him. On November 8,\r\n1963, after undertaking the responsibility for advance preparations\r\nfor the visit to Dallas, Agent Lawson went to the PRS offices in\r\nWashington. A check of the geographic indexes there revealed no listing\r\nfor any individual deemed to be a potential danger to the President\r\nin the territory of the Secret Service regional office which includes\r\nDallas and Fort Worth.[C2-21]\r\n\r\nTo supplement the PRS files, the Secret Service depends largely on\r\nlocal police departments and local offices of other Federal agencies\r\nwhich advise it of potential threats immediately before the visit\r\nof the President to their community. Upon his arrival in Dallas on\r\nNovember 12 Lawson conferred with the local police and the local\r\noffice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation about potential dangers\r\nto the President. Although there was no mention in PRS files of the\r\ndemonstration in Dallas against Ambassador Adlai Stevenson on October\r\n24, 1963, Lawson inquired about the incident and obtained through the\r\nlocal police photographs of some of the persons involved.[C2-22] On\r\nNovember 22 a Secret Service agent stood at the entrance to the Trade\r\nMart, where the President was scheduled to speak, with copies of these\r\nphotographs. Dallas detectives in the lobby of the Trade Mart and in\r\nthe luncheon area also had copies of these photographs. A number of\r\npeople who resembled some of those in the photographs were placed under\r\nsurveillance at the Trade Mart.[C2-23]\r\n\r\nThe FBI office in Dallas gave the local Secret Service representatives\r\nthe name of a possibly dangerous individual in the Dallas area who was\r\ninvestigated. It also advised the Secret Service of the circulation on\r\nNovember 21 of a handbill sharply critical of President Kennedy,[C2-24]\r\ndiscussed in chapter VI of this report. Shortly before, the Dallas\r\npolice had reported to the Secret Service that the handbill had\r\nappeared on the streets of Dallas. Neither the Dallas police nor the\r\nFBI had yet learned the source of the handbill.[C2-25] No one else was\r\nidentified to the Secret Service through local inquiry as potentially\r\ndangerous, nor did PRS develop any additional information between\r\nNovember 12, when Lawson left Washington, and November 22. The adequacy\r\nof the intelligence system maintained by the Secret Service at the time\r\nof the assassination, including a detailed description of the available\r\ndata on Lee Harvey Oswald and the reasons why his name had not been\r\nfurnished to the Secret Service, is discussed in chapter VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Luncheon Site\r\n\r\nAn important purpose of the President’s visit to Dallas was to speak at\r\na luncheon given by business and civic leaders. The White House staff\r\ninformed the Secret Service that the President would arrive and depart\r\nfrom Dallas’ Love Field; that a motorcade through the downtown area of\r\nDallas to the luncheon site should be arranged; and that following the\r\nluncheon the President would return to the airport by the most direct\r\nroute. Accordingly, it was important to determine the luncheon site as\r\nquickly as possible, so that security could be established at the site\r\nand the motorcade route selected.\r\n\r\nOn November 4, Gerald A. Behn, agent in charge of the White House\r\ndetail, asked Sorrels to examine three potential sites for the\r\nluncheon.[C2-26] One building, Market Hall, was unavailable for\r\nNovember 22. The second, the Women’s Building at the State Fair\r\nGrounds, was a one-story building with few entrances and easy to make\r\nsecure, but it lacked necessary food-handling facilities and had\r\ncertain unattractive features, including a low ceiling with exposed\r\nconduits and beams. The third possibility, the Trade Mart, a handsome\r\nnew building with all the necessary facilities, presented security\r\nproblems. It had numerous entrances, several tiers of balconies\r\nsurrounding the central court where the luncheon would be held, and\r\nseveral catwalks crossing the court at each level. On November 4,\r\nSorrels told Behn he believed security difficulties at the Trade Mart\r\ncould be overcome by special precautions.[C2-27] Lawson also evaluated\r\nthe security hazards at the Trade Mart on November 13.[C2-28] Kenneth\r\nO’Donnell made the final decision to hold the luncheon at the Trade\r\nMart; Behn so notified Lawson on November 14.[C2-29]\r\n\r\nOnce the Trade Mart had been selected, Sorrels and Lawson worked out\r\ndetailed arrangements for security at the building. In addition to the\r\npreventive measures already mentioned, they provided for controlling\r\naccess to the building, closing off and policing areas around it,\r\nsecuring the roof and insuring the presence of numerous police\r\nofficers inside and around the building. Ultimately more than 200 law\r\nenforcement officers, mainly Dallas police but including 8 Secret\r\nService agents, were deployed in and around the Trade Mart.[C2-30]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Motorcade Route\r\n\r\nOn November 8, when Lawson was briefed on the itinerary for the trip to\r\nDallas, he was told that 45 minutes had been allotted for a motorcade\r\nprocession from Love Field to the luncheon site.[C2-31] Lawson was not\r\nspecifically instructed to select the parade route, but he understood\r\nthat this was one of his functions.[C2-32] Even before the Trade Mart\r\nhad been definitely selected, Lawson and Sorrels began to consider the\r\nbest motorcade route from Love Field to the Trade Mart. On November 14,\r\nLawson and Sorrels attended a meeting at Love Field and on their return\r\nto Dallas drove over the route which Sorrels believed best suited for\r\nthe proposed motorcade.[C2-33] This route, eventually selected for the\r\nmotorcade from the airport to the Trade Mart, measured 10 miles and\r\ncould be driven easily within the allotted 45 minutes.[C2-34] From Love\r\nField the route passed through a portion of suburban Dallas, through\r\nthe downtown area along Main Street and then to the Trade Mart via\r\nStemmons Freeway. For the President’s return to Love Field following\r\nthe luncheon, the agents selected the most direct route, which was\r\napproximately 4 miles.[C2-35]\r\n\r\nAfter the selection of the Trade Mart as the luncheon site, Lawson\r\nand Sorrels met with Dallas Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry, Assistant\r\nChief Charles Batchelor, Deputy Chief N. T. Fisher, and several other\r\ncommand officers to discuss details of the motorcade and possible\r\nroutes.[C2-36] The route was further reviewed by Lawson and Sorrels\r\nwith Assistant Chief Batchelor and members of the local host committee\r\non November 15. The police officials agreed that the route recommended\r\nby Sorrels was the proper one and did not express a belief that any\r\nother route might be better.[C2-37] On November 18, Sorrels and Lawson\r\ndrove over the selected route with Batchelor and other police officers,\r\nverifying that it could be traversed within 45 minutes. Representatives\r\nof the local host committee and the White House staff were advised by\r\nthe Secret Service of the actual route on the afternoon of November\r\n18.[C2-38]\r\n\r\nThe route impressed the agents as a natural and desirable one. Sorrels,\r\nwho had participated in Presidential protection assignments in Dallas\r\nsince a visit by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936,[C2-39]\r\ntestified that the traditional parade route in Dallas was along Main\r\nStreet, since the tall buildings along the street gave more people an\r\nopportunity to participate.[C2-40] The route chosen from the airport\r\nto Main Street was the normal one, except where Harwood Street was\r\nselected as the means of access to Main Street in preference to a short\r\nstretch of the Central Expressway, which presented a minor safety\r\nhazard and could not accommodate spectators as conveniently as Harwood\r\nStreet.[C2-41] According to Lawson, the chosen route seemed to be the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n    It afforded us wide streets most of the way, because of the\r\n    buses that were in the motorcade. It afforded us a chance to\r\n    have alternative routes if something happened on the motorcade\r\n    route. It was the type of suburban area a good part of the way\r\n    where the crowds would be able to be controlled for a great\r\n    distance, and we figured that the largest crowds would be\r\n    downtown, which they were, and that the wide streets that we\r\n    would use downtown would be of sufficient width to keep the\r\n    public out of our way.[C2-42]\r\n\r\nElm Street, parallel to Main Street and one block north, was not used\r\nfor the main portion of the downtown part of the motorcade because Main\r\nStreet offered better vantage points for spectators.\r\n\r\nTo reach the Trade Mart from Main Street the agents decided to use\r\nthe Stemmons Freeway (Route No. 77), the most direct route. The only\r\npractical way for westbound traffic on Main Street to reach the\r\nnorthbound lanes of the Stemmons Freeway is via Elm Street, which\r\nRoute No. 77 traffic is instructed to follow in this part of the\r\ncity. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2113, p. 34.) Elm Street was to be\r\nreached from Main by turning right at Houston, going one block north\r\nand then turning left onto Elm. On this last portion of the journey,\r\nonly 5 minutes from the Trade Mart, the President’s motorcade would\r\npass the Texas School Book Depository Building on the northwest corner\r\nof Houston and Elm Streets. The building overlooks Dealey Plaza,\r\nan attractively landscaped triangle of 3 acres. (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 876, p. 33.) From Houston Street, which forms the base\r\nof the triangle, three streets--Commerce, Main, and Elm--trisect\r\nthe plaza, converging at the apex of the triangle to form a triple\r\nunderpass beneath a multiple railroad bridge almost 500 feet from\r\nHouston Street.[C2-43] Elm Street, the northernmost of the three,\r\nafter intersecting Houston curves in a southwesterly arc through the\r\nunderpass and leads into an access road, which branches off to the\r\nright and is used by traffic going to the Stemmons Freeway and the\r\nDallas-Fort Worth Turnpike. (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 2113-2116,\r\npp. 34-37.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 876\r\n\r\nDEALEY PLAZA--DALLAS, TEXAS\r\n\r\n  1. TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY\r\n  2.

To\r\ncreate this traffic pattern, a concrete barrier between Main and Elm\r\nStreets presents an obstacle to a right turn from Main across Elm to\r\nthe access road to Stemmons Freeway and the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike.\r\nThis concrete barrier extends far enough beyond the access road to\r\nmake it impracticable for vehicles to turn right from Main directly to\r\nthe access road. A sign located on this barrier instructs Main Street\r\ntraffic not to make any turns.[C2-45] (See Commission Exhibits Nos.\r\n2114-2116, pp. 35-37.) In conformity with these arrangements, traffic\r\nproceeding west on Main is directed to turn right at Houston in order\r\nto reach the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike, which has the same access road\r\nfrom Elm Street as does the Stemmons Freeway.[C2-46] (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 2967, p. 38.)\r\n\r\nThe planning for the motorcade also included advance preparations for\r\nsecurity arrangements along the route. Sorrels and Lawson reviewed the\r\nroute in cooperation with Assistant Chief Batchelor and other Dallas\r\npolice officials who took notes on the requirements for controlling the\r\ncrowds and traffic, watching the overpasses, and providing motorcycle\r\nescort.[C2-47] To control traffic, arrangements were made for the\r\ndeployment of foot patrolmen and motorcycle police at various positions\r\nalong the route.[C2-48] Police were assigned to each overpass on the\r\nroute and instructed to keep them clear of unauthorized persons.[C2-49]\r\nNo arrangements were made for police or building custodians to inspect\r\nbuildings along the motorcade route since the Secret Service did\r\nnot normally request or make such a check.[C2-50] Under standard\r\nprocedures, the responsibility for watching the windows of buildings\r\nwas shared by local police stationed along the route and Secret Service\r\nagents riding in the motorcade.[C2-51]\r\n\r\nAs the date for the President’s visit approached, the two Dallas\r\nnewspapers carried several reports of his motorcade route. The\r\nselection of the Trade Mart as the possible site for the luncheon first\r\nappeared in the Dallas Times-Herald on November 15, 1963.[C2-52] The\r\nfollowing day, the newspaper reported that the Presidential party\r\n“apparently will loop through the downtown area, probably on Main\r\nStreet, en route from Dallas Love Field” on its way to the Trade\r\nMart.[C2-53] On November 19, the Times-Herald afternoon paper detailed\r\nthe precise route:\r\n\r\n    From the airport, the President’s party will proceed to\r\n    Mockingbird Lane to Lemmon and then to Turtle Creek, turning\r\n    south to Cedar Springs.\r\n\r\n    The motorcade will then pass through downtown on Harwood and\r\n    then west on Main, turning back to Elm at Houston and then out\r\n    Stemmons Freeway to the Trade Mart.[C2-54]\r\n\r\nAlso on November 19, the Morning News reported that the President’s\r\nmotorcade would travel from Love Field along specified streets, then\r\n“Harwood to Main, Main to Houston, Houston to Elm, Elm under the Triple\r\nUnderpass to Stemmons Freeway, and on to the Trade Mart.”[C2-55] On\r\nNovember 20 a front page story reported that the streets on which\r\nthe Presidential motorcade would travel included “Main and Stemmons\r\nFreeway.”[C2-56] On the morning of the President’s arrival, the Morning\r\nNews noted that the motorcade would travel through downtown Dallas onto\r\nthe Stemmons Freeway, and reported that “the motorcade will move slowly\r\nso that crowds can ‘get a good view’ of President Kennedy and his\r\nwife.”[C2-57]\r\n\r\n\r\nDALLAS BEFORE THE VISIT\r\n\r\nThe President’s intention to pay a visit to Texas in the fall of 1963\r\naroused interest throughout the State. The two Dallas newspapers\r\nprovided their readers with a steady stream of information and\r\nspeculation about the trip, beginning on September 13, when the\r\nTimes-Herald announced in a front page article that President Kennedy\r\nwas planning a brief 1-day tour of four Texas cities--Dallas, Fort\r\nWorth, San Antonio, and Houston.[C2-58] Both Dallas papers cited White\r\nHouse sources on September 26 as confirming the President’s intention\r\nto visit Texas on November 21 and 22, with Dallas scheduled as one of\r\nthe stops.[C2-59]\r\n\r\nArticles, editorials, and letters to the editor in the Dallas Morning\r\nNews and the Dallas Times-Herald after September 13 reflected the\r\nfeeling in the community toward the forthcoming Presidential visit.\r\nAlthough there were critical editorials and letters to the editors, the\r\nnews stories reflected the desire of Dallas officials to welcome the\r\nPresident with dignity and courtesy. An editorial in the Times-Herald\r\nof September 17 called on the people of Dallas to be “congenial\r\nhosts” even though “Dallas didn’t vote for Mr. Kennedy in 1960, may\r\nnot endorse him in ’64.”[C2-60] On October 3 the Dallas Morning News\r\nquoted U.S. Representative Joe Pool’s hope that President Kennedy would\r\nreceive a “good welcome” and would not face demonstrations like those\r\nencountered by Vice President Johnson during the 1960 campaign.[C2-61]\r\n\r\nIncreased concern about the President’s visit was aroused by the\r\nincident involving the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai\r\nE. Stevenson. On the evening of October 24, 1963, after addressing\r\na meeting in Dallas, Stevenson was jeered, jostled, and spat upon\r\nby hostile demonstrators outside the Dallas Memorial Auditorium\r\nTheater.[C2-62] The local, national, and international reaction to\r\nthis incident evoked from Dallas officials and newspapers strong\r\ncondemnations of the demonstrators. Mayor Earle Cabell called on the\r\ncity to redeem itself during President Kennedy’s visit.[C2-63] He\r\nasserted that Dallas had shed its reputation of the twenties as the\r\n“Southwest hate capital of Dixie.”[C2-64] On October 26 the press\r\nreported Chief of Police Curry’s plans to call in 100 extra off-duty\r\nofficers to help protect President Kennedy.[C2-65] Any thought that\r\nthe President might cancel his visit to Dallas was ended when Governor\r\nConnally confirmed on November 8 that the President would come to Texas\r\non November 21-22, and that he would visit San Antonio, Houston, Fort\r\nWorth, Dallas, and Austin.[C2-66]\r\n\r\nDuring November the Dallas papers reported frequently on the plans\r\nfor protecting the President, stressing the thoroughness of the\r\npreparations. They conveyed the pleas of Dallas leaders that citizens\r\nnot demonstrate or create disturbances during the President’s visit.\r\nOn November 18 the Dallas City Council adopted a new city ordinance\r\nprohibiting interference with attendance at lawful assemblies.[C2-67]\r\nTwo days before the President’s arrival Chief Curry warned that the\r\nDallas police would not permit improper conduct during the President’s\r\nvisit.[C2-68]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on November 17 the president of the Dallas Chamber of\r\nCommerce referred to the city’s reputation for being the friendliest\r\ntown in America and asserted that citizens would “greet the President\r\nof the United States with the warmth and pride that keep the Dallas\r\nspirit famous the world over.”[C2-69] Two days later, a local\r\nRepublican leader called for a “civilized nonpartisan” welcome for\r\nPresident Kennedy, stating that “in many respects Dallas County has\r\nisolated itself from the main stream of life in the world in this\r\ndecade.”[C2-70]\r\n\r\nAnother reaction to the impending visit--hostile to the President--came\r\nto a head shortly before his arrival. On November 21 there appeared\r\non the streets of Dallas the anonymous handbill mentioned above. It\r\nwas fashioned after the “wanted” circulars issued by law enforcement\r\nagencies. Beneath two photographs of President Kennedy, one fullface\r\nand one profile, appeared the caption, “Wanted for Treason,” followed\r\nby a scurrilous bill of particulars that constituted a vilification of\r\nthe President.[C2-71] And on the morning of the President’s arrival,\r\nthere appeared in the Morning News a full page, black-bordered\r\nadvertisement headed “Welcome Mr. Kennedy to Dallas,” sponsored by\r\nthe American Factfinding Committee, which the sponsor later testified\r\nwas an ad hoc committee “formed strictly for the purpose of having\r\na name to put in the paper.”[C2-72] The “welcome” consisted of a\r\nseries of statements and questions critical of the President and his\r\nadministration.[C2-73] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1031, p. 294.)\r\n\r\n\r\nVISITS TO OTHER TEXAS CITIES\r\n\r\nThe trip to Texas began with the departure of President and Mrs.\r\nKennedy from the White House by helicopter at 10:45 a.m., e.s.t., on\r\nNovember 21, 1963, for Andrews AFB. They took off in the Presidential\r\nplane, _Air Force One_, at 11 a.m., arriving at San Antonio at 1:30\r\np.m., c.s.t. They were greeted by Vice President Johnson and Governor\r\nConnally, who joined the Presidential party in a motorcade through San\r\nAntonio.[C2-74] During the afternoon, President Kennedy dedicated the\r\nU.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks AFB.[C2-75] Late\r\nin the afternoon he flew to Houston where he rode through the city in a\r\nmotorcade, spoke at the Rice University Stadium, and attended a dinner\r\nin honor of U.S. Representative Albert Thomas.[C2-76]\r\n\r\nAt Rice Stadium a very large, enthusiastic crowd greeted the\r\nPresident.[C2-77] In Houston, as elsewhere during the trip, the\r\ncrowds showed much interest in Mrs. Kennedy. David F. Powers of the\r\nPresident’s staff later stated that when the President asked for his\r\nassessment of the day’s activities, Powers replied “that the crowd was\r\nabout the same as the one which came to see him before but there were\r\n100,000 extra people on hand who came to see Mrs. Kennedy.”[C2-78] Late\r\nin the evening, the Presidential party flew to Fort Worth where they\r\nspent the night at the Texas Hotel.[C2-79]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of November 22, President Kennedy attended a breakfast\r\nat the hotel and afterward addressed a crowd at an open parking\r\nlot.[C2-80] The President liked outdoor appearances because more people\r\ncould see and hear him.[C2-81] Before leaving the hotel, the President,\r\nMrs. Kennedy, and Kenneth O’Donnell talked about the risks inherent\r\nin Presidential public appearances.[C2-82] According to O’Donnell,\r\nthe President commented that “if anybody really wanted to shoot the\r\nPresident of the United States, it was not a very difficult job--all\r\none had to do was get a high building someday with a telescopic\r\nrifle, and there was nothing anybody could do to defend against such\r\nan attempt.”[C2-83] Upon concluding the conversation, the President\r\nprepared to depart for Dallas.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL AT LOVE FIELD\r\n\r\nIn Dallas the rain had stopped, and by midmorning a gloomy overcast\r\nsky had given way to the bright sunshine that greeted the Presidential\r\nparty when _Air Force One_ touched down at Love Field at 11:40\r\na.m., c.s.t.[C2-84] Governor and Mrs. Connally and Senator Ralph\r\nW. Yarborough had come with the President from Fort Worth.[C2-85]\r\nVice President Johnson’s airplane, _Air Force Two_, had arrived at\r\nLove Field at approximately 11:35 a.m., and the Vice President and\r\nMrs. Johnson were in the receiving line to greet President and Mrs.\r\nKennedy.[C2-86]\r\n\r\nAfter a welcome from the Dallas reception committee, President and Mrs.\r\nKennedy walked along a chain-link fence at the reception area greeting\r\na large crowd of spectators that had gathered behind it.[C2-87] Secret\r\nService agents formed a cordon to keep the press and photographers\r\nfrom impeding their passage and scanned the crowd for threatening\r\nmovements.[C2-88] Dallas police stood at intervals along the fence\r\nand Dallas plainclothesmen mixed in the crowd.[C2-89] Vice President\r\nand Mrs. Johnson followed along the fence, guarded by four members of\r\nthe Vice-Presidential detail.[C2-90] Approximately 10 minutes after\r\nthe arrival at Love Field, the President and Mrs. Kennedy went to the\r\nPresidential automobile to begin the motorcade.[C2-91]\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE MOTORCADE\r\n\r\nSecret Service arrangements for Presidential trips, which were\r\nfollowed in the Dallas motorcade, are designed to provide protection\r\nwhile permitting large numbers of people to see the President.[C2-92]\r\nEvery effort is made to prevent unscheduled stops, although the\r\nPresident may, and in Dallas did, order stops in order to greet the\r\npublic.[C2-93] When the motorcade slows or stops, agents take positions\r\nbetween the President and the crowd.[C2-94]\r\n\r\nThe order of vehicles in the Dallas motorcade was as follows:\r\n\r\n_Motorcycles._--Dallas police motorcycles preceded the pilot car.[C2-95]\r\n\r\n_The pilot car._--Manned by officers of the Dallas Police Department,\r\nthis automobile preceded the main party by approximately a quarter\r\nof a mile. Its function was to alert police along the route that the\r\nmotorcade was approaching and to check for signs of trouble.[C2-96]\r\n\r\n_Motorcycles._--Next came four to six motorcycle policemen whose main\r\npurpose was to keep the crowd back.[C2-97]\r\n\r\n_The lead car._--Described as a “rolling command car,” this was an\r\nunmarked Dallas police car, driven by Chief of Police Curry and\r\noccupied by Secret Service Agents Sorrels and Lawson and by Dallas\r\nCounty Sheriff J. E. Decker. The occupants scanned the crowd and the\r\nbuildings along the route. Their main function was to spot trouble\r\nin advance and to direct any necessary steps to meet the trouble.\r\nFollowing normal practice, the lead automobile stayed approximately\r\nfour to five car lengths ahead of the President’s limousine.[C2-98]\r\n\r\n_The Presidential limousine._--The President’s automobile was a\r\nspecially designed 1961 Lincoln convertible with two collapsible jump\r\nseats between the front and rear seats.[C2-99] (See Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 346, p. 44.) It was outfitted with a clear plastic bubble-top\r\nwhich was neither bulletproof nor bullet resistant.[C2-100] Because\r\nthe skies had cleared in Dallas, Lawson directed that the top not be\r\nused for the day’s activities. He acted on instructions he had received\r\nearlier from Assistant Special Agent in Charge Roy H. Kellerman, who\r\nwas in Fort Worth with the President.[C2-101] Kellerman had discussed\r\nthe matter with O’Donnell, whose instructions were, “If the weather\r\nis clear and it is not raining, have that bubbletop off.”[C2-102]\r\nElevated approximately 15 inches above the back of the front seat was\r\na metallic frame with four handholds that riders in the car could grip\r\nwhile standing in the rear seat during parades.[C2-103] At the rear on\r\neach side of the automobile were small running boards, each designed\r\nto hold a Secret Service agent, with a metallic handle for the rider\r\nto grasp.[C2-104] The President had frequently stated that he did not\r\nwant agents to ride on these steps during a motorcade except when\r\nnecessary. He had repeated this wish only a few days before, during his\r\nvisit to Tampa, Fla.[C2-105]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 346\r\n\r\nInterior of Presidential limousine used on November 22, 1963.]\r\n\r\nPresident Kennedy rode on the right-hand side of the rear seat with\r\nMrs. Kennedy on his left.[C2-106] Governor Connally occupied the right\r\njump seat, Mrs. Connally the left.[C2-107] Driving the Presidential\r\nlimousine was Special Agent William R. Greer of the Secret Service; on\r\nhis right sat Kellerman.[C2-108] Kellerman’s responsibilities included\r\nmaintaining radio communications with the lead and followup cars,\r\nscanning the route, and getting out and standing near the President\r\nwhen the cars stopped.\r\n\r\n_Motorcycles._--Four motorcycles, two on each side, flanked the rear\r\nof the Presidential car. They provided some cover for the President,\r\nbut their main purpose was to keep back the crowd.[C2-109] On previous\r\noccasions, the President had requested that, to the extent possible,\r\nthese flanking motorcycles keep back from the sides of his car.[C2-110]\r\n\r\n_Presidential followup car._--This vehicle, a 1955 Cadillac\r\neight-passenger convertible especially outfitted for the Secret\r\nService, followed closely behind the President’s automobile.[C2-111]\r\nIt carried eight Secret Service agents--two in the front seat, two in\r\nthe rear, and two on each of the right and left running boards.[C2-112]\r\nEach agent carried a .38-caliber pistol, and a shotgun and automatic\r\nrifle were also available.[C2-113] Presidential Assistants David F.\r\nPowers and Kenneth O’Donnell sat in the right and left jump seats,\r\nrespectively.[C2-114]\r\n\r\nThe agents in this car, under established procedure, had instructions\r\nto watch the route for signs of trouble, scanning not only the\r\ncrowds but the windows and roofs of buildings, overpasses, and\r\ncrossings.[C2-115] They were instructed to watch particularly for\r\nthrown objects, sudden actions in the crowd, and any movements toward\r\nthe Presidential car.[C2-116] The agents on the front of the running\r\nboards had directions to move immediately to positions just to the\r\nrear of the President and Mrs. Kennedy when the President’s car slowed\r\nto a walking pace or stopped, or when the press of the crowd made it\r\nimpossible for the escort motorcycles to stay in position on the car’s\r\nrear flanks.[C2-117] The two agents on the rear of the running boards\r\nwere to advance toward the front of the President’s car whenever it\r\nstopped or slowed down sufficiently for them to do so.[C2-118]\r\n\r\n_Vice-Presidential car._--The Vice-Presidential automobile, a four-door\r\nLincoln convertible obtained locally for use in the motorcade,\r\nproceeded approximately two to three car lengths behind the President’s\r\nfollowup car.[C2-119] This distance was maintained so that spectators\r\nwould normally turn their gaze from the President’s automobile by\r\nthe time the Vice President came into view.[C2-120] Vice President\r\nJohnson sat on the right-hand side of the rear seat, Mrs. Johnson\r\nin the center, and Senator Yarborough on the left.[C2-121] Rufus W.\r\nYoungblood, special agent in charge of the Vice President’s detail,\r\noccupied the right-hand side of the front seat, and Hurchel Jacks of\r\nthe Texas State Highway patrol was the driver.[C2-122]\r\n\r\n_Vice-Presidential followup car._--Driven by an officer of the Dallas\r\nPolice Department, this vehicle was occupied by three Secret Service\r\nagents and Clifton C. Carter, assistant to the Vice President.[C2-123]\r\nThese agents performed for the Vice President the same functions that\r\nthe agents in the Presidential followup car performed for the President.\r\n\r\n_Remainder of motorcade._--The remainder of the motorcade consisted\r\nof five cars for other dignitaries, including the mayor of Dallas\r\nand Texas Congressmen, telephone and Western Union vehicles, a White\r\nHouse communications car, three cars for press photographers, an\r\nofficial party bus for White House staff members and others, and two\r\npress buses. Admiral George G. Burkley, physician to the President,\r\nwas in a car following those “containing the local and national\r\nrepresentatives.”[C2-124]\r\n\r\n_Police car and motorcycles._[C2-125]--A Dallas police car and several\r\nmotorcycles at the rear kept the motorcade together and prevented\r\nunauthorized vehicles from joining the motorcade.\r\n\r\n_Communications in the motorcade._[C2-126]--A base station at a fixed\r\nlocation in Dallas operated a radio network which linked together the\r\nlead car, Presidential car, Presidential followup car, White House\r\ncommunications car, Trade Mart, Love Field, and the Presidential\r\nand Vice-Presidential airplanes. The Vice-Presidential car and\r\nVice-Presidential followup car used portable sets with a separate\r\nfrequency for their own car-to-car communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DRIVE THROUGH DALLAS\r\n\r\nThe motorcade left Love Field shortly after 11:50 a.m. and drove at\r\nspeeds up to 25 to 30 miles an hour through thinly populated areas on\r\nthe outskirts of Dallas.[C2-127] At the President’s direction, his\r\nautomobile stopped twice, the first time to permit him to respond to\r\na sign asking him to shake hands.[C2-128] During this brief stop,\r\nagents in the front positions on the running boards of the Presidential\r\nfollowup car came forward and stood beside the President’s car,\r\nlooking out toward the crowd, and Special Agent Kellerman assumed his\r\nposition next to the car.[C2-129] On the other occasion, the President\r\nhalted the motorcade to speak to a Catholic nun and a group of small\r\nchildren.[C2-130]\r\n\r\nIn the downtown area, large crowds of spectators gave the President a\r\ntremendous reception.[C2-131] The crowds were so dense that Special\r\nAgent Clinton J. Hill had to leave the left front running board of\r\nthe President’s followup car four times to ride on the rear of the\r\nPresident’s limousine.[C2-132] (See Commission Exhibit No. 698, p. 47.)\r\nSeveral times Special Agent John D. Ready came forward from the right\r\nfront running board of the Presidential followup car to the right side\r\nof the President’s car.[C2-133] Special Agent Glen A. Bennett once left\r\nhis place inside the followup car to help keep the crowd away from\r\nthe President’s car. When a teenage boy ran toward the rear of the\r\nPresident’s car,[C2-134] Ready left the running board to chase the boy\r\nback into the crowd. On several occasions when the Vice President’s\r\ncar was slowed down by the throng, Special Agent Youngblood stepped out\r\nto hold the crowd back.[C2-135]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 698\r\n\r\nPresidential limousine in Dallas motorcade.]\r\n\r\nAccording to plan, the President’s motorcade proceeded west through\r\ndowntown Dallas on Main Street to the intersection of Houston Street,\r\nwhich marks the beginning of Dealey Plaza.[C2-136] From Main Street\r\nthe motorcade turned right and went north on Houston Street, passing\r\ntall buildings on the right, and headed toward the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Building.[C2-137] The spectators were still thickly\r\ncongregated in front of the buildings which lined the east side of\r\nHouston Street, but the crowd thinned abruptly along Elm Street, which\r\ncurves in a southwesterly direction as it proceeds downgrade toward the\r\nTriple Underpass and the Stemmons Freeway.[C2-138]\r\n\r\nAs the motorcade approached the intersection of Houston and Elm\r\nStreets, there was general gratification in the Presidential party\r\nabout the enthusiastic reception. Evaluating the political overtones,\r\nKenneth O’Donnell was especially pleased because it convinced him\r\nthat the average Dallas resident was like other American citizens in\r\nrespecting and admiring the President.[C2-139] Mrs. Connally, elated by\r\nthe reception, turned to President Kennedy and said, “Mr. President,\r\nyou can’t say Dallas doesn’t love you.” The President replied, “That is\r\nvery obvious.”[C2-140]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASSASSINATION\r\n\r\nAt 12:30 p.m., c.s.t., as the President’s open limousine proceeded at\r\napproximately 11 miles per hour along Elm Street toward the Triple\r\nUnderpass, shots fired from a rifle mortally wounded President Kennedy\r\nand seriously injured Governor Connally. One bullet passed through the\r\nPresident’s neck; a subsequent bullet, which was lethal, shattered the\r\nright side of his skull. Governor Connally sustained bullet wounds in\r\nhis back, the right side of his chest, right wrist, and left thigh.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Time\r\n\r\nThe exact time of the assassination was fixed by the testimony of four\r\nwitnesses. Special Agent Rufus W. Youngblood observed that the large\r\nelectric sign clock atop the Texas School Book Depository Building\r\nshowed the numerals “12:30” as the Vice-Presidential automobile\r\nproceeded north on Houston Street, a few seconds before the shots were\r\nfired.[C2-141] Just prior to the shooting, David F. Powers, riding in\r\nthe Secret Service followup car, remarked to Kenneth O’Donnell that\r\nit was 12:30 p.m., the time they were due at the Trade Mart.[C2-142]\r\nSeconds after the shooting, Roy Kellerman, riding in the front seat\r\nof the Presidential limousine, looked at his watch and said “12:30”\r\nto the driver, Special Agent Greer.[C2-143] The Dallas police radio\r\nlog reflects that Chief of Police Curry reported the shooting of the\r\nPresident and issued his initial orders at 12:30 p.m.[C2-144]\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeed of the Limousine\r\n\r\nWilliam Greer, operator of the Presidential limousine, estimated\r\nthe car’s speed at the time of the first shot as 12 to 15 miles per\r\nhour.[C2-145] Other witnesses in the motorcade estimated the speed\r\nof the President’s limousine from 7 to 22 miles per hour.[C2-146] A\r\nmore precise determination has been made from motion pictures taken\r\non the scene by an amateur photographer, Abraham Zapruder. Based on\r\nthese films, the speed of the President’s automobile is computed at an\r\naverage speed of 11.2 miles per hour. The car maintained this average\r\nspeed over a distance of approximately 136 feet immediately preceding\r\nthe shot which struck the President in the head. While the car traveled\r\nthis distance, the Zapruder camera ran 152 frames. Since the camera\r\noperates at a speed of 18.3 frames per second, it was calculated that\r\nthe car required 8.3 seconds to cover the 136 feet. This represents a\r\nspeed of 11.2 miles per hour.[C2-147]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Presidential Limousine\r\n\r\nMrs. John F. Kennedy, on the left of the rear seat of the limousine,\r\nlooked toward her left and waved to the crowds along the route. Soon\r\nafter the motorcade turned onto Elm Street, she heard a sound similar\r\nto a motorcycle noise and a cry from Governor Connally, which caused\r\nher to look to her right. On turning she saw a quizzical look on her\r\nhusband’s face as he raised his left hand to his throat. Mrs. Kennedy\r\nthen heard a second shot and saw the President’s skull torn open under\r\nthe impact of the bullet. As she cradled her mortally wounded husband,\r\nMrs. Kennedy cried, “Oh, my God, they have shot my husband. I love you,\r\nJack.”[C2-148]\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally testified that he recognized the first noise as a\r\nrifle shot and the thought immediately crossed his mind that it was\r\nan assassination attempt. From his position in the right jump seat\r\nimmediately in front of the President, he instinctively turned to his\r\nright because the shot appeared to come from over his right shoulder.\r\nUnable to see the President as he turned to the right, the Governor\r\nstarted to look back over his left shoulder, but he never completed the\r\nturn because he felt something strike him in the back.[C2-149] In his\r\ntestimony before the Commission, Governor Connally was certain that he\r\nwas hit by the second shot, which he stated he did not hear.[C2-150]\r\n\r\nMrs. Connally, too, heard a frightening noise from her right. Looking\r\nover her right shoulder, she saw that the President had both hands\r\nat his neck but she observed no blood and heard nothing. She watched\r\nas he slumped down with an empty expression on his face.[C2-151] Roy\r\nKellerman, in the right front seat of the limousine, heard a report\r\nlike a firecracker pop. Turning to his right in the direction of the\r\nnoise, Kellerman heard the President say “My God, I am hit,” and saw\r\nboth of the President’s hands move up toward his neck. As he told the\r\ndriver, “Let’s get out of here; we are hit,” Kellerman grabbed his\r\nmicrophone and radioed ahead to the lead car, “We are hit. Get us to\r\nthe hospital immediately.”[C2-152]\r\n\r\nThe driver, William Greer, heard a noise which he took to be a backfire\r\nfrom one of the motorcycles flanking the Presidential car. When he\r\nheard the same noise again, Greer glanced over his shoulder and saw\r\nGovernor Connally fall. At the sound of the second shot he realized\r\nthat something was wrong, and he pressed down on the accelerator as\r\nKellerman said, “Get out of here fast.”[C2-153] As he issued his\r\ninstructions to Greer and to the lead car, Kellerman heard a “flurry\r\nof shots” within 5 seconds of the first noise. According to Kellerman,\r\nMrs. Kennedy then cried out: “What are they doing to you?” Looking back\r\nfrom the front seat, Kellerman saw Governor Connally in his wife’s\r\nlap and Special Agent Clinton J. Hill lying across the trunk of the\r\ncar.[C2-154]\r\n\r\nMrs. Connally heard a second shot fired and pulled her husband down\r\ninto her lap.[C2-155] Observing his blood-covered chest as he was\r\npulled into his wife’s lap, Governor Connally believed himself mortally\r\nwounded. He cried out, “Oh, no, no, no. My God, they are going to kill\r\nus all.”[C2-156] At first Mrs. Connally thought that her husband had\r\nbeen killed, but then she noticed an almost imperceptible movement\r\nand knew that he was still alive. She said, “It’s all right. Be\r\nstill.”[C2-157] The Governor was lying with his head on his wife’s lap\r\nwhen he heard a shot hit the President.[C2-158] At that point, both\r\nGovernor and Mrs. Connally observed brain tissue splattered over the\r\ninterior of the car.[C2-159] According to Governor and Mrs. Connally,\r\nit was after this shot that Kellerman issued his emergency instructions\r\nand the car accelerated.[C2-160]\r\n\r\n\r\nReaction by Secret Service Agents\r\n\r\nFrom the left front running board of the President’s followup car,\r\nSpecial Agent Hill was scanning the few people standing on the south\r\nside of Elm Street after the motorcade had turned off Houston Street.\r\nHe estimated that the motorcade had slowed down to approximately 9 or\r\n10 miles per hour on the turn at the intersection of Houston and Elm\r\nStreets and then proceeded at a rate of 12 to 15 miles per hour with\r\nthe followup car trailing the President’s automobile by approximately\r\n5 feet.[C2-161] Hill heard a noise, which seemed to be a firecracker,\r\ncoming from his right rear. He immediately looked to his right,\r\n“and, in so doing, my eyes had to cross the Presidential limousine\r\nand I saw President Kennedy grab at himself and lurch forward and to\r\nthe left.”[C2-162] Hill jumped from the followup car and ran to the\r\nPresident’s automobile. At about the time he reached the President’s\r\nautomobile, Hill heard a second shot, approximately 5 seconds after the\r\nfirst, which removed a portion of the President’s head.[C2-163]\r\n\r\nAt the instant that Hill stepped onto the left rear step of the\r\nPresident’s automobile and grasped the handhold, the car lurched\r\nforward, causing him to lose his footing. He ran three or four steps,\r\nregained his position and mounted the car. Between the time he\r\noriginally seized the handhold and the time he mounted the car, Hill\r\nrecalled that--\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Kennedy had jumped up from the seat and was, it appeared\r\n    to me, reaching for something coming off the right rear bumper\r\n    of the car, the right rear tail, when she noticed that I was\r\n    trying to climb on the car. She turned toward me and I grabbed\r\n    her and put her back in the back seat, crawled up on top of the\r\n    back seat and lay there.[C2-164]\r\n\r\nDavid Powers, who witnessed the scene from the President’s followup\r\ncar, stated that Mrs. Kennedy would probably have fallen off the rear\r\nend of the car and been killed if Hill had not pushed her back into the\r\nPresidential automobile.[C2-165] Mrs. Kennedy had no recollection of\r\nclimbing onto the back of the car.[C2-166]\r\n\r\nSpecial Agent Ready, on the right front running board of the\r\nPresidential followup car, heard noises that sounded like firecrackers\r\nand ran toward the President’s limousine. But he was immediately called\r\nback by Special Agent Emory P. Roberts, in charge of the followup car,\r\nwho did not believe that he could reach the President’s car at the\r\nspeed it was then traveling.[C2-167] Special Agent George W. Hickey,\r\nJr., in the rear seat of the Presidential followup car, picked up and\r\ncocked an automatic rifle as he heard the last shot. At this point the\r\ncars were speeding through the underpass and had left the scene of the\r\nshooting, but Hickey kept the automatic weapon ready as the car raced\r\nto the hospital.[C2-168] Most of the other Secret Service agents in\r\nthe motorcade had drawn their sidearms.[C2-169] Roberts noticed that\r\nthe Vice President’s car was approximately one-half block behind the\r\nPresidential followup car at the time of the shooting and signaled for\r\nit to move in closer.[C2-170]\r\n\r\nDirecting the security detail for the Vice President from the right\r\nfront seat of the Vice-Presidential car, Special Agent Youngblood\r\nrecalled:\r\n\r\n    As we were beginning to go down this incline, all of a sudden\r\n    there was an explosive noise. I quickly observed unnatural\r\n    movement of crowds, like ducking or scattering, and quick\r\n    movements in the Presidential followup car. So I turned around\r\n    and hit the Vice President on the shoulder and hollered, get\r\n    down, and then looked around again and saw more of this\r\n    movement, and so I proceeded to go to the back seat and get on\r\n    top of him.[C2-171]\r\n\r\nYoungblood was not positive that he was in the rear seat before the\r\nsecond shot, but thought it probable because of President Johnson’s\r\nstatement to that effect immediately after the assassination.[C2-172]\r\nPresident Johnson emphasized Youngblood’s instantaneous reaction after\r\nthe first shot:\r\n\r\n    I was startled by the sharp report or explosion, but I had no\r\n    time to speculate as to its origin because Agent Youngblood\r\n    turned in a flash, immediately after the first explosion,\r\n    hitting me on the shoulder, and shouted to all of us in the\r\n    back seat to get down. I was pushed down by Agent Youngblood.\r\n    Almost in the same moment in which he hit or pushed me, he\r\n    vaulted over the back seat and sat on me. I was bent over under\r\n    the weight of Agent Youngblood’s body, toward Mrs. Johnson and\r\n    Senator Yarborough.[C2-173]\r\n\r\nClifton C. Carter, riding in the Vice President’s followup car a short\r\ndistance behind, reported that Youngblood was in the rear seat using\r\nhis body to shield the Vice President before the second and third shots\r\nwere fired.[C2-174]\r\n\r\nOther Secret Service agents assigned to the motorcade remained at\r\ntheir posts during the race to the hospital. None stayed at the scene\r\nof the shooting, and none entered the Texas School Book Depository\r\nBuilding at or immediately after the shooting. Secret Service procedure\r\nrequires that each agent stay with the person being protected and\r\nnot be diverted unless it is necessary to accomplish the protective\r\nassignment.[C2-175] Forrest V. Sorrels, special agent in charge of the\r\nDallas office, was the first Secret Service agent to return to the\r\nscene of the assassination, approximately 20 or 25 minutes after the\r\nshots were fired.[C2-176]\r\n\r\n\r\nPARKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nThe Race to the Hospital\r\n\r\nIn the final instant of the assassination, the Presidential motorcade\r\nbegan a race to Parkland Memorial Hospital, approximately 4 miles from\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository Building.[C2-177] On receipt of the\r\nradio message from Kellerman to the lead car that the President had\r\nbeen hit, Chief of Police Curry and police motorcyclists at the head\r\nof the motorcade led the way to the hospital.[C2-178] Meanwhile, Chief\r\nCurry ordered the police base station to notify Parkland Hospital that\r\nthe wounded President was en route.[C2-179] The radio log of the Dallas\r\nPolice Department shows that at 12:30 p.m. on November 22 Chief Curry\r\nradioed, “Go to the hospital--Parkland Hospital. Have them stand by.”\r\nA moment later Curry added, “Looks like the President has been hit.\r\nHave Parkland stand by.” The base station replied, “They have been\r\nnotified.”[C2-180] Traveling at speeds estimated at times to be up\r\nto 70 or 80 miles per hour down the Stemmons Freeway and Harry Hines\r\nBoulevard, the Presidential limousine arrived at the emergency entrance\r\nof the Parkland Hospital at about 12:35 p.m.[C2-181] Arriving almost\r\nsimultaneously were the President’s followup car, the Vice President’s\r\nautomobile, and the Vice President’s followup car. Admiral Burkley, the\r\nPresident’s physician, arrived at the hospital “between 3 and 5 minutes\r\nfollowing the arrival of the President,” since the riders in his car\r\n“were not exactly aware what had happened” and the car went on to the\r\nTrade Mart first.[C2-182]\r\n\r\nWhen Parkland Hospital received the notification, the staff in\r\nthe emergency area was alerted and trauma rooms 1 and 2 were\r\nprepared.[C2-183] These rooms were for the emergency treatment\r\nof acutely ill or injured patients.[C2-184] Although the first\r\nmessage mentioned an injury only to President Kennedy, two rooms\r\nwere prepared.[C2-185] As the President’s limousine sped toward\r\nthe hospital, 12 doctors rushed to the emergency area: surgeons,\r\nDrs. Malcolm O. Perry, Charles R. Baxter, Robert N. McClelland,\r\nRonald C. Jones; the chief neurologist, Dr. William Kemp Clark; 4\r\nanesthesiologists, Drs. Marion T. Jenkins, Adolph H. Giesecke, Jr.,\r\nJackie H. Hunt, Gene C. Akin; a urological surgeon, Dr Paul C. Peters;\r\nan oral surgeon, Dr. Don T. Curtis; and a heart specialist, Dr. Fouad\r\nA. Bashour.[C2-186]\r\n\r\nUpon arriving at Parkland Hospital, Lawson jumped from the lead car and\r\nrushed into the emergency entrance, where he was met by hospital staff\r\nmembers wheeling stretchers out to the automobile.[C2-187] Special\r\nAgent Hill removed his suit jacket and covered the President’s head\r\nand upper chest to prevent the taking of photographs.[C2-188] Governor\r\nConnally, who had lost consciousness on the ride to the hospital,\r\nregained consciousness when the limousine stopped abruptly at the\r\nemergency entrance. Despite his serious wounds, Governor Connally tried\r\nto get out of the way so that medical help could reach the President.\r\nAlthough he was reclining in his wife’s arms, he lurched forward in\r\nan effort to stand upright and get out of the car, but he collapsed\r\nagain. Then he experienced his first sensation of pain, which became\r\nexcruciating.[C2-189] The Governor was lifted onto a stretcher and\r\ntaken into trauma room 2.[C2-190] For a moment, Mrs. Kennedy refused to\r\nrelease the President, whom she held in her lap, but then Kellerman,\r\nGreer, and Lawson lifted the President onto a stretcher and pushed it\r\ninto trauma room 1.[C2-191]\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment of President Kennedy\r\n\r\nThe first physician to see the President at Parkland Hospital was Dr.\r\nCharles J. Carrico, a resident in general surgery.[C2-192] Dr. Carrico\r\nwas in the emergency area, examining another patient, when he was\r\nnotified that President Kennedy was en route to the hospital.[C2-193]\r\nApproximately 2 minutes later, Dr. Carrico saw the President on his\r\nback, being wheeled into the emergency area.[C2-194] He noted that\r\nthe President was blue-white or ashen in color; had slow, spasmodic,\r\nagonal respiration without any coordination; made no voluntary\r\nmovements; had his eyes open with the pupils dilated without any\r\nreaction to light; evidenced no palpable pulse; and had a few chest\r\nsounds which were thought to be heart beats.[C2-195] On the basis of\r\nthese findings, Dr. Carrico concluded that President Kennedy was still\r\nalive.[C2-196]\r\n\r\nDr. Carrico noted two wounds: a small bullet wound in the front\r\nlower neck, and an extensive wound in the President’s head where\r\na sizable portion of the skull was missing.[C2-197] He observed\r\nshredded brain tissue and “considerable slow oozing” from the latter\r\nwound, followed by “more profuse bleeding” after some circulation\r\nwas established.[C2-198] Dr. Carrico felt the President’s back and\r\ndetermined that there was no large wound there which would be an\r\nimmediate threat to life.[C2-199] Observing the serious problems\r\npresented by the head wound and inadequate respiration, Dr. Carrico\r\ndirected his attention to improving the President’s breathing.[C2-200]\r\nHe noted contusions, hematoma to the right of the larynx, which was\r\ndeviated slightly to the left, and also ragged tissue which indicated\r\na tracheal injury.[C2-201] Dr. Carrico inserted a cuffed endotracheal\r\ntube past the injury, inflated the cuff, and connected it to a Bennett\r\nmachine to assist in respiration.[C2-202]\r\n\r\nAt that point, direction of the President’s treatment was undertaken by\r\nDr. Malcolm O. Perry, who arrived at trauma room 1 a few moments after\r\nthe President.[C2-203] Dr. Perry noted the President’s back brace as\r\nhe felt for a femoral pulse, which he did not find.[C2-204] Observing\r\nthat an effective airway had to be established if treatment was to be\r\neffective, Dr. Perry performed a tracheotomy, which required 3 to 5\r\nminutes.[C2-205] While Dr. Perry was performing the tracheotomy, Drs.\r\nCarrico and Ronald Jones made cutdowns on the President’s right leg and\r\nleft arm, respectively, to infuse blood and fluids into the circulatory\r\nsystem.[C2-206] Dr. Carrico treated the President’s known adrenal\r\ninsufficiency by administering hydrocortisone.[C2-207] Dr. Robert\r\nN. McClelland entered at that point and assisted Dr. Perry with the\r\ntracheotomy.[C2-208]\r\n\r\nDr. Fouad Bashour, chief of cardiology, Dr. M. T. Jenkins, chief\r\nof anesthesiology, and Dr. A. H. Giesecke, Jr., then joined in the\r\neffort to revive the President.[C2-209] When Dr. Perry noted free air\r\nand blood in the President’s chest cavity, he asked that chest tubes\r\nbe inserted to allow for drainage of blood and air. Drs. Paul C.\r\nPeters and Charles R. Baxter initiated these procedures.[C2-210] As a\r\nresult of the infusion of liquids through the cutdowns, the cardiac\r\nmassage, and the airway, the doctors were able to maintain peripheral\r\ncirculation as monitored at the neck (carotid) artery and at the wrist\r\n(radial) pulse. A femoral pulse was also detected in the President’s\r\nleg.[C2-211] While these medical efforts were in progress, Dr. Clark\r\nnoted some electrical activity on the cardiotachyscope attached to\r\nmonitor the President’s heart responses.[C2-212] Dr. Clark, who most\r\nclosely observed the head wound, described a large, gaping wound in the\r\nright rear part of the head, with substantial damage and exposure of\r\nbrain tissue, and a considerable loss of blood.[C2-213] Dr. Clark did\r\nnot see any other hole or wound on the President’s head. According to\r\nDr. Clark, the small bullet hole on the right rear of the President’s\r\nhead discovered during the subsequent autopsy “could have easily been\r\nhidden in the blood and hair.”[C2-214]\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any neurological, muscular, or heart response,\r\nthe doctors concluded that efforts to revive the President were\r\nhopeless.[C2-215] This was verified by Admiral Burkley, the President’s\r\nphysician, who arrived at the hospital after emergency treatment\r\nwas underway and concluded that “my direct services to him at that\r\nmoment would have interfered with the action of the team which was\r\nin progress.”[C2-216] At approximately 1 p.m., after last rites were\r\nadministered to the President by Father Oscar L. Huber, Dr. Clark\r\npronounced the President dead. He made the official determination\r\nbecause the ultimate cause of death, the severe head injury, was within\r\nhis sphere of specialization.[C2-217] The time was fixed at 1 p.m.,\r\nas an approximation, since it was impossible to determine the precise\r\nmoment when life left the President.[C2-218] President Kennedy could\r\nhave survived the neck injury, but the head wound was fatal.[C2-219]\r\nFrom a medical viewpoint, President Kennedy was alive when he arrived\r\nat Parkland Hospital; the doctors observed that he had a heart beat\r\nand was making some respiratory efforts.[C2-220] But his condition was\r\nhopeless, and the extraordinary efforts of the doctors to save him\r\ncould not help but to have been unavailing.\r\n\r\nSince the Dallas doctors directed all their efforts to controlling the\r\nmassive bleeding caused by the head wound, and to reconstructing an\r\nairway to his lungs, the President remained on his back throughout his\r\nmedical treatment at Parkland.[C2-221] When asked why he did not turn\r\nthe President over, Dr. Carrico testified as follows:\r\n\r\n    A. This man was in obvious extreme distress and any more\r\n    thorough inspection would have involved several minutes--well,\r\n    several--considerable time which at this juncture was not\r\n    available. A thorough inspection would have involved washing\r\n    and cleansing the back, and this is not practical in treating\r\n    an acutely injured patient. You have to determine which things,\r\n    which are immediately life threatening and cope with them,\r\n    before attempting to evaluate the full extent of the injuries.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you ever have occasion to look at the President’s back?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir. Before--well, in trying to treat an acutely injured\r\n    patient, you have to establish an airway, adequate ventilation\r\n    and you have to establish adequate circulation. Before this was\r\n    accomplished the President’s cardiac activity had ceased and\r\n    closed cardiac massage was instituted, which made it impossible\r\n    to inspect his back.\r\n\r\n    Q. Was any effort made to inspect the President’s back after he\r\n    had expired?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. And why was no effort made at that time to inspect his back?\r\n\r\n\r\n    A. I suppose nobody really had the heart to do it.[C2-222]\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Parkland doctors took no further action after the\r\nPresident had expired because they concluded that it was beyond the\r\nscope of their permissible duties.[C2-223]\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment of Governor Connally\r\n\r\nWhile one medical team tried to revive President Kennedy, a second\r\nperformed a series of operations on the bullet wounds sustained by\r\nGovernor Connally.[C2-224] Governor Connally was originally seen by Dr.\r\nCarrico and Dr. Richard Dulany.[C2-225] While Dr. Carrico went on to\r\nattend the President, Dr. Dulany stayed with the Governor and was soon\r\njoined by several other doctors.[C2-226] At approximately 12:45 p.m.,\r\nDr. Robert Shaw, chief of thoracic surgery, arrived at trauma room 2,\r\nto take charge of the care of Governor Connally, whose major wound fell\r\nwithin Dr. Shaw’s area of specialization.[C2-227]\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally had a large sucking wound in the front of the right\r\nchest which caused extreme pain and difficulty in breathing. Rubber\r\ntubes were inserted between the second and third ribs to reexpand the\r\nright lung, which had collapsed because of the opening in the chest\r\nwall.[C2-228] At 1:35 p.m., after Governor Connally had been moved to\r\nthe operating room, Dr. Shaw started the first operation by cutting\r\naway the edges of the wound on the front of the Governor’s chest and\r\nsuturing the damaged lung and lacerated muscles.[C2-229] The elliptical\r\nwound in the Governor’s back, located slightly to the left of the\r\nGovernor’s right armpit approximately five-eighths inch (a centimeter\r\nand a half) in its greatest diameter, was treated by cutting away\r\nthe damaged skin and suturing the back muscle and skin.[C2-230] This\r\noperation was concluded at 3:20 p.m.[C2-231]\r\n\r\nTwo additional operations were performed on Governor Connally for\r\nwounds which he had not realized he had sustained until he regained\r\nconsciousness the following day.[C2-232] From approximately 4 p.m. to\r\n4:50 p.m. on November 22, Dr. Charles F. Gregory, chief of orthopedic\r\nsurgery, operated on the wounds of Governor Connally’s right wrist,\r\nassisted by Drs. William Osborne and John Parker.[C2-233] The wound on\r\nthe back of the wrist was left partially open for draining, and the\r\nwound on the palm side was enlarged, cleansed, and closed. The fracture\r\nwas set, and a cast was applied with some traction utilized.[C2-234]\r\nWhile the second operation was in progress, Dr. George T. Shires,\r\nassisted by Drs. Robert McClelland, Charles Baxter, and Ralph Don\r\nPatman, treated the gunshot wound in the left thigh.[C2-235] This\r\npunctuate missile wound, about two-fifths inch in diameter (1\r\ncentimeter) and located approximately 5 inches above the left knee,\r\nwas cleansed and closed with sutures; but a small metallic fragment\r\nremained in the Governor’s leg.[C2-236]\r\n\r\n\r\nVice President Johnson at Parkland\r\n\r\nAs President Kennedy and Governor Connally were being removed from the\r\nlimousine onto stretchers, a protective circle of Secret Service agents\r\nsurrounded Vice President and Mrs. Johnson and escorted them into\r\nParkland Hospital through the emergency entrance.[C2-237] The agents\r\nmoved a nurse and patient out of a nearby room, lowered the shades, and\r\ntook emergency security measures to protect the Vice President.[C2-238]\r\nTwo men from the President’s followup car were detailed to help\r\nprotect the Vice President. An agent was stationed at the entrance\r\nto stop anyone who was not a member of the Presidential party. U.S.\r\nRepresentatives Henry B. Gonzalez, Jack Brooks, Homer Thornberry, and\r\nAlbert Thomas joined Clifton C. Carter and the group of special agents\r\nprotecting the Vice President.[C2-239] On one occasion Mrs. Johnson,\r\naccompanied by two Secret Service agents, left the room to see Mrs.\r\nKennedy and Mrs. Connally.[C2-240]\r\n\r\nConcern that the Vice President might also be a target for\r\nassassination prompted the Secret Service agents to urge him to\r\nleave the hospital and return to Washington immediately.[C2-241] The\r\nVice President decided to wait until he received definitive word of\r\nthe President’s condition.[C2-242] At approximately 1:20 p.m., Vice\r\nPresident Johnson was notified by O’Donnell that President Kennedy was\r\ndead.[C2-243] Special Agent Youngblood learned from Mrs. Johnson the\r\nlocation of her two daughters and made arrangements through Secret\r\nService headquarters in Washington to provide them with protection\r\nimmediately.[C2-244]\r\n\r\nWhen consulted by the Vice President, O’Donnell advised him to go to\r\nthe airfield immediately and return to Washington.[C2-245] It was\r\ndecided that the Vice President should return on the Presidential\r\nplane rather than on the Vice-Presidential plane because it had better\r\ncommunication equipment.[C2-246] The Vice President conferred with\r\nWhite House Assistant Press Secretary Malcolm Kilduff and decided\r\nthat there would be no release of the news of the President’s death\r\nuntil the Vice President had left the hospital.[C2-247] When told that\r\nMrs. Kennedy refused to leave without the President’s body, the Vice\r\nPresident said that he would not leave Dallas without her.[C2-248] On\r\nthe recommendation of the Secret Service agents, Vice President Johnson\r\ndecided to board the Presidential airplane, _Air Force One_, and wait\r\nfor Mrs. Kennedy and the President’s body.[C2-249]\r\n\r\n\r\nSecret Service Emergency Security Arrangements\r\n\r\nImmediately after President Kennedy’s stretcher was wheeled into trauma\r\nroom 1, Secret Service agents took positions at the door of the small\r\nemergency room. A nurse was asked to identify hospital personnel and\r\nto tell everyone, except necessary medical staff members, to leave the\r\nemergency room. Other Secret Service agents posted themselves in the\r\ncorridors and other areas near the emergency room. Special Agent Lawson\r\nmade certain that the Dallas police kept the public and press away\r\nfrom the immediate area of the hospital.[C2-250] Agents Kellerman and\r\nHill telephoned the head of the White House detail, Gerald A. Behn, to\r\nadvise him of the assassination. The telephone line to Washington was\r\nkept open throughout the remainder of the stay at the hospital.[C2-251]\r\n\r\nSecret Service agents stationed at later stops on the President’s\r\nitinerary of November 22 were redeployed. Men at the Trade Mart were\r\ndriven to Parkland Hospital in Dallas police cars.[C2-252] The Secret\r\nService group awaiting the President in Austin were instructed to\r\nreturn to Washington.[C2-253] Meanwhile, the Secret Service agents\r\nin charge of security at Love Field started to make arrangements for\r\ndeparture. As soon as one of the agents learned of the shooting, he\r\nasked the officer in charge of the police detail at the airport to\r\ninstitute strict security measures for the Presidential aircraft, the\r\nairport terminal, and the surrounding area. The police were cautioned\r\nto prevent picture taking. Secret Service agents working with police\r\ncleared the areas adjacent to the aircraft, including warehouses,\r\nother terminal buildings and the neighboring parking lots, of all\r\npeople.[C2-254] The agents decided not to shift the Presidential\r\naircraft to the far side of the airport because the original landing\r\narea was secure and a move would require new measures.[C2-255]\r\n\r\nWhen security arrangements at the airport were complete, the Secret\r\nService made the necessary arrangements for the Vice President to leave\r\nthe hospital. Unmarked police cars took the Vice President and Mrs.\r\nJohnson from Parkland Hospital to Love Field. Chief Curry drove one\r\nautomobile occupied by Vice President Johnson, U.S. Representatives\r\nThomas and Thornberry, and Special Agent Youngblood. In another car\r\nMrs. Johnson was driven to the airport accompanied by Secret Service\r\nagents and Representative Brooks. Motorcycle policemen who escorted the\r\nautomobiles were requested by the Vice President and Agent Youngblood\r\nnot to use sirens. During the drive Vice President Johnson, at\r\nYoungblood’s instruction, kept below window level.[C2-256]\r\n\r\n\r\nRemoval of the President’s Body\r\n\r\nWhile the team of doctors at Parkland Hospital tried desperately to\r\nsave the life of President Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy alternated between\r\nwatching them and waiting outside.[C2-257] After the President was\r\npronounced dead, O’Donnell tried to persuade Mrs. Kennedy to leave the\r\narea, but she refused. She said that she intended to stay with her\r\nhusband.[C2-258] A casket was obtained and the President’s body was\r\nprepared for removal.[C2-259] Before the body could be taken from the\r\nhospital, two Dallas officials informed members of the President’s\r\nstaff that the body could not be removed from the city until an autopsy\r\nwas performed. Despite the protests of these officials, the casket was\r\nwheeled out of the hospital, placed in an ambulance, and transported to\r\nthe airport shortly after 2 p.m.[C2-260] At approximately 2:15 p.m. the\r\ncasket was loaded, with some difficulty because of the narrow airplane\r\ndoor, onto the rear of the Presidential plane where seats had been\r\nremoved to make room.[C2-261] Concerned that the local officials might\r\ntry to prevent the plane’s departure, O’Donnell asked that the pilot\r\ntake off immediately. He was informed that takeoff would be delayed\r\nuntil Vice President Johnson was sworn in.[C2-262]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE TRIP\r\n\r\nSwearing in of the New President\r\n\r\nFrom the Presidential airplane, the Vice President telephoned Attorney\r\nGeneral Robert F. Kennedy, who advised that Mr. Johnson take the\r\nPresidential oath of office before the plane left Dallas.[C2-263]\r\nFederal Judge Sarah T. Hughes hastened to the plane to administer the\r\noath.[C2-264] Members of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential parties\r\nfilled the central compartment of the plane to witness the swearing in.\r\nAt 2:38 p.m., c.s.t., Lyndon Baines Johnson took the oath of office as\r\nthe 36th President of the United States.[C2-265] Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs.\r\nJohnson stood at the side of the new President as he took the oath of\r\noffice.[C2-266] Nine minutes later, the Presidential airplane departed\r\nfor Washington, D.C.[C2-267]\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn to Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nOn the return flight, Mrs. Kennedy sat with David Powers, Kenneth\r\nO’Donnell, and Lawrence O’Brien.[C2-268] At 5:58 p.m., e.s.t.,\r\n_Air Force One_ landed at Andrews AFB, where President Kennedy had\r\nbegun his last trip only 31 hours before.[C2-269] Detailed security\r\narrangements had been made by radio from the President’s plane on the\r\nreturn flight.[C2-270] The public had been excluded from the base,\r\nand only Government officials and the press were permitted near the\r\nlanding area. Upon arrival, President Johnson made a brief statement\r\nover television and radio. President and Mrs. Johnson were flown by\r\nhelicopter to the White House, from where Mrs. Johnson was driven to\r\nher residence under Secret Service escort. The President then walked to\r\nthe Executive Office Building, where he worked until 9 p.m.[C2-271]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Autopsy\r\n\r\nGiven a choice between the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda,\r\nMd., and the Army’s Walter Reed Hospital, Mrs. Kennedy chose the\r\nhospital in Bethesda for the autopsy because the President had served\r\nin the Navy.[C2-272] Mrs. Kennedy and the Attorney General, with three\r\nSecret Service agents, accompanied President Kennedy’s body on the\r\n45-minute automobile trip from Andrews AFB to the Hospital.[C2-273] On\r\nthe 17th floor of the Hospital, Mrs. Kennedy and the Attorney General\r\njoined other members of the Kennedy family to await the conclusion of\r\nthe autopsy.[C2-274] Mrs. Kennedy was guarded by Secret Service agents\r\nin quarters assigned to her in the naval hospital.[C2-275] The Secret\r\nService established a communication system with the White House and\r\nscreened all telephone calls and visitors.[C2-276]\r\n\r\nThe hospital received the President’s body for autopsy at approximately\r\n7:35 p.m.[C2-277] X-rays and photographs were taken preliminarily\r\nand the pathological examination began at about 8 p.m.[C2-278] The\r\nautopsy report noted that President Kennedy was 46 years of age, 72½\r\ninches tall, weighed 170 pounds, had blue eyes and reddish-brown\r\nhair. The body was muscular and well developed with no gross skeletal\r\nabnormalities except for those caused by the gunshot wounds. Under\r\n“Pathological Diagnosis” the cause of death was set forth as “Gunshot\r\nwound, head.”[C2-279] (See app. IX.)\r\n\r\nThe autopsy examination revealed two wounds in the President’s head.\r\nOne wound, approximately one-fourth of an inch by five-eighths of an\r\ninch (6 by 15 millimeters), was located about an inch (2.5 centimeters)\r\nto the right and slightly above the large bony protrusion (external\r\noccipital protuberance) which juts out at the center of the lower part\r\nof the back of the skull. The second head wound measured approximately\r\n5 inches (13 centimeters) in its greatest diameter, but it was\r\ndifficult to measure accurately because multiple crisscross fractures\r\nradiated from the large defect.[C2-280] During the autopsy examination,\r\nFederal agents brought the surgeons three pieces of bone recovered from\r\nElm Street and the Presidential automobile. When put together, these\r\nfragments accounted for approximately three-quarters of the missing\r\nportion of the skull.[C2-281] The surgeons observed, through X-ray\r\nanalysis, 30 or 40 tiny dustlike fragments of metal running in a line\r\nfrom the wound in the rear of the President’s head toward the front\r\npart of the skull, with a sizable metal fragment lying just above the\r\nright eye.[C2-282] From this head wound two small irregularly shaped\r\nfragments of metal were recovered and turned over to the FBI.[C2-283]\r\n\r\nThe autopsy also disclosed a wound near the base of the back of\r\nPresident Kennedy’s neck slightly to the right of his spine. The\r\ndoctors traced the course of the bullet through the body and, as\r\ninformation was received from Parkland Hospital, concluded that the\r\nbullet had emerged from the front portion of the President’s neck that\r\nhad been cut away by the tracheotomy at Parkland.[C2-284] The nature\r\nand characteristics of this neck wound and the two head wounds are\r\ndiscussed fully in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nAfter the autopsy was concluded at approximately 11 p.m., the\r\nPresident’s body was prepared for burial. This was finished at\r\napproximately 4 a.m.[C2-285] Shortly thereafter, the President’s wife,\r\nfamily and aides left Bethesda Naval Hospital.[C2-286] The President’s\r\nbody was taken to the East Room of the White House where it was placed\r\nunder ceremonial military guard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe Shots From the Texas School Book Depository\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter the Commission analyzes the evidence and sets forth\r\nits conclusions concerning the source, effect, number and timing\r\nof the shots that killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor\r\nConnally. In that connection the Commission has evaluated (1) the\r\ntestimony of eyewitnesses present at the scene of the assassination;\r\n(2) the damage to the Presidential limousine; (3) the examination by\r\nqualified experts of the rifle and cartridge cases found on the sixth\r\nfloor of the Texas School Book Depository and the bullet fragments\r\nfound in the Presidential limousine and at Parkland Hospital; (4)\r\nthe wounds suffered by President Kennedy and Governor Connally; (5)\r\nwound ballistics tests; (6) the examination by qualified experts of\r\nthe clothing worn by President Kennedy and Governor Connally; and (7)\r\nmotion-picture films and still photographs taken at the time of the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WITNESSES\r\n\r\nAs reflected in the previous chapter, passengers in the first few cars\r\nof the motorcade had the impression that the shots came from the rear\r\nand from the right, the general direction of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building, although none of these passengers saw anyone\r\nfire the shots. Some spectators at Houston and Elm Streets, however,\r\ndid see a rifle being fired in the direction of the President’s car\r\nfrom the easternmost window of the sixth floor on the south side of\r\nthe building. Other witnesses saw a rifle in this window immediately\r\nafter the assassination. Three employees of the Depository, observing\r\nthe parade from the fifth floor, heard the shots fired from the floor\r\nimmediately above them. No credible evidence suggests that the shots\r\nwere fired from the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass, the\r\nnearby railroad yards or any place other than the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 477\r\n\r\nPosition of Howard L. Brennan on November 22, 1963. (Photograph taken\r\non March 20, 1964, and marked by Brennan during his testimony to show\r\nthe window (A) in which he saw a man with a rifle, and the window (B)\r\non the fifth floor in which he saw people watching the motorcade.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the Depository\r\n\r\nEyewitnesses testified that they saw a man fire a weapon from the\r\nsixth-floor window. Howard L. Brennan, a 45-year-old steamfitter,\r\nwatched the motorcade from a concrete retaining wall at the southwest\r\ncorner of Elm and Houston, where he had a clear view of the south side\r\nof the Depository Building.[C3-1] (See Commission Exhibit No. 477, p.\r\n62.) He was approximately 107 feet from the Depository entrance and\r\n120 feet from the southeast corner window of the sixth floor.[C3-2]\r\nBrennan’s presence and vantage point are corroborated by a motion\r\npicture of the motorcade taken by amateur photographer Abraham\r\nZapruder, which shows Brennan, wearing gray khaki work clothes and a\r\ngray work helmet, seated on the retaining wall.[C3-3] Brennan later\r\nidentified himself in the Zapruder movie.[C3-4] While waiting about\r\n7 minutes for the President to arrive, he observed the crowd on the\r\nstreet and the people at the windows of the Depository Building.[C3-5]\r\nHe noticed a man at the southeast corner window of the sixth floor, and\r\nobserved him leave the window “a couple of times.”[C3-6]\r\n\r\nBrennan watched the President’s car as it turned the corner at Houston\r\nand Elm and moved down the incline toward the Triple Underpass. Soon\r\nafter the President’s car passed, he heard an explosion like the\r\nbackfire of a motorcycle.[C3-7] Brennan recalled:\r\n\r\n    Well, then something, just right after this explosion, made me\r\n    think that it was a firecracker being thrown from the Texas\r\n    Book Store. And I glanced up. And this man that I saw previous\r\n    was aiming for his last shot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Well, as it appeared to me he was standing up and resting\r\n    against the left window sill, with gun shouldered to his\r\n    right shoulder, holding the gun with his left hand and taking\r\n    positive aim and fired his last shot. As I calculate a couple\r\n    of seconds. He drew the gun back from the window as though he\r\n    was drawing it back to his side and maybe paused for another\r\n    second as though to assure hisself that he hit his mark, and\r\n    then he disappeared.[C3-8]\r\n\r\nBrennan stated that he saw 70 to 85 percent of the gun when it was\r\nfired and the body of the man from the waist up.[C3-9] The rifle was\r\naimed southwesterly down Elm Street toward the underpass.[C3-10]\r\nBrennan saw the man fire one shot and he remembered hearing a total\r\nof only two shots. When questioned about the number of shots, Brennan\r\ntestified:\r\n\r\n    I don’t know what made me think that there was firecrackers\r\n    throwed out of the Book Store unless I did hear the second\r\n    shot, because I positively thought the first shot was a\r\n    backfire, and subconsciously I must have heard a second shot,\r\n    but I do not recall it. I could not swear to it.[C3-11]\r\n\r\nBrennan quickly reported his observations to police officers.[C3-12]\r\nBrennan’s description of the man he saw is discussed in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nAmos Lee Euins, a 15-year-old ninth grade student, stated that he was\r\nfacing the Depository as the motorcade turned the corner at Elm and\r\nHouston. He recalled:\r\n\r\n    Then I was standing here, and as the motorcade turned the\r\n    corner, I was facing, looking dead at the building. And so I\r\n    seen this pipe thing sticking out the window. I wasn’t paying\r\n    too much attention to it. Then when the first shot was fired, I\r\n    started looking around, thinking it was a backfire. Everybody\r\n    else started looking around. Then I looked up at the window,\r\n    and he shot again.[C3-13]\r\n\r\nAfter witnessing the first shots, Euins hid behind a fountain bench\r\nand saw the man shoot again from the window in the southeast corner of\r\nthe Depository’s sixth floor.[C3-14] According to Euins, the man had\r\none hand on the barrel and the other on the trigger. Euins believed\r\nthat there were four shots.[C3-15] Immediately after the assassination,\r\nhe reported his observations to Sgt. D. V. Harkness of the Dallas\r\nPolice Department and also to James Underwood of station KRLD-TV of\r\nDallas.[C3-16] Sergeant Harkness testified that Euins told him that\r\nthe shots came from the last window of the floor “under the ledge”\r\non the side of the building they were facing.[C3-17] Based on Euins’\r\nstatements, Harkness radioed to headquarters at 12:36 p.m. that “I have\r\na witness that says that it came from the fifth floor of the Texas Book\r\nDepository Store.”[C3-18] Euins accurately described the sixth floor as\r\nthe floor “under the ledge.” Harkness testified that the error in the\r\nradio message was due to his own “hasty count of the floors.”[C3-19]\r\n\r\nOther witnesses saw a rifle in the window after the shots were fired.\r\nRobert H. Jackson, staff photographer, Dallas Times Herald, was in a\r\npress car in the Presidential motorcade, eight or nine cars from the\r\nfront. On Houston Street about halfway between Main and Elm, Jackson\r\nheard the first shot.[C3-20] As someone in the car commented that it\r\nsounded like a firecracker, Jackson heard two more shots.[C3-21] He\r\ntestified:\r\n\r\n    Then we realized or we thought that it was gunfire, and then we\r\n    could not at that point see the President’s car. We were still\r\n    moving slowly, and after the third shot the second two shots\r\n    seemed much closer together than the first shot, than they were\r\n    to the first shot. Then after the last shot, I guess all of\r\n    us were just looking all around and I just looked straight up\r\n    ahead of me which would have been looking at the School Book\r\n    Depository and I noticed two Negro men in a window straining to\r\n    see directly above them, and my eyes followed right on up to\r\n    the window above them and I saw the rifle or what looked like\r\n    a rifle approximately half of the weapon, I guess I saw, and\r\n    just as I looked at it, it was drawn fairly slowly back into\r\n    the building, and I saw no one in the window with it.\r\n\r\n    I didn’t even see a form in the window.[C3-22]\r\n\r\nIn the car with Jackson were James Underwood, television station\r\nKRLD-TV; Thomas Dillard, chief photographer, Dallas Morning News;\r\nMalcolm O. Couch and James Darnell, television newsreel cameramen.\r\nDillard, Underwood, and the driver were in the front seat, Couch\r\nand Darnell were sitting on top of the back seat of the convertible\r\nwith Jackson. Dillard, Couch, and Underwood confirmed that Jackson\r\nspontaneously exclaimed that he saw a rifle in the window.[C3-23]\r\nAccording to Dillard, at the time the shots were fired he and his\r\nfellow passengers “had an absolutely perfect view of the School\r\nDepository from our position in the open car.”[C3-24] Dillard\r\nimmediately took two pictures of the building: one of the east\r\ntwo-thirds of the south side and the other of the southeast corner,\r\nparticularly the fifth- and sixth-floor windows.[C3-25] These pictures\r\nshow three Negro men in windows on the fifth floor and the partially\r\nopen window on the sixth floor directly above them. (See Dillard\r\nExhibits C and D, pp. 66-67.) Couch also saw the rifle in the window,\r\nand testified:\r\n\r\n    And after the third shot, Bob Jackson, who was, as I recall,\r\n    on my right, yelled something like, “Look up in the window!\r\n    There’s the rifle!”\r\n\r\n    And I remember glancing up to a window on the far right, which\r\n    at the time impressed me as the sixth or seventh floor, and\r\n    seeing about a foot of a rifle being--the barrel brought into\r\n    the window.[C3-26]\r\n\r\nCouch testified he saw people standing in other windows on the third\r\nor fourth floor in the middle of the south side, one of them being a\r\nNegro in a white T-shirt leaning out to look up at the windows above\r\nhim.[C3-27]\r\n\r\nMayor and Mrs. Earle Cabell rode in the motorcade immediately behind\r\nthe Vice-Presidential followup car.[C3-28] Mrs. Cabell was seated in\r\nthe back seat behind the driver and was facing U.S. Representative\r\nRay Roberts on her right as the car made the turn at Elm and Houston.\r\nIn this position Mrs. Cabell “was actually facing” the seven-story\r\nDepository when the first shot rang out.[C3-29] She “jerked” her head\r\nup immediately and saw a “projection” in the first group of windows\r\non a floor which she described both as the sixth floor and the top\r\nfloor.[C3-30] According to Mrs. Cabell, the object was “rather long\r\nlooking,” but she was unable to determine whether it was a mechanical\r\nobject or a person’s arm.[C3-31] She turned away from the window to\r\ntell her husband that the noise was a shot, and “just as I got the\r\nwords out * * * the second two shots rang out.”[C3-32] Mrs. Cabell did\r\nnot look at the sixth-floor window when the second and third shots were\r\nfired.[C3-33]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DILLARD EXHIBIT C\r\n\r\nEnlargement of photograph taken by Thomas C. Dillard on November 22,\r\n1963.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DILLARD EXHIBIT D\r\n\r\nPhotograph taken by Thomas C. Dillard on November 22, 1963.]\r\n\r\nJames N. Crawford and Mary Ann Mitchell, two deputy district clerks for\r\nDallas County, watched the motorcade at the southeast corner of Elm and\r\nHouston. After the President’s car turned the corner, Crawford heard\r\na loud report which he thought was backfire coming from the direction\r\nof the Triple Underpass.[C3-34] He heard a second shot seconds later,\r\nfollowed quickly by a third. At the third shot, he looked up and saw a\r\n“movement” in the far east corner of the sixth floor of the Depository,\r\nthe only open window on that floor.[C3-35] He told Miss Mitchell “that\r\nif those were shots they came from that window.” When asked to describe\r\nthe movement more exactly, he said,\r\n\r\n    * * * I would say that it was a profile, somewhat from\r\n    the waist up, but it was a very quick movement and rather\r\n    indistinct and it was very light colored. * * *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    When I saw it, I automatically in my mind came to the\r\n    conclusion that it was a person having moved out of the window.\r\n    * * *[C3-36]\r\n\r\nHe could not state whether the person was a man or a woman.[C3-37] Miss\r\nMitchell confirmed that after the third shot Crawford told her, “Those\r\nshots came from that building.”[C3-38] She saw Crawford pointing at a\r\nwindow but was not sure at which window he was pointing.[C3-39]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Fifth Floor\r\n\r\nThree Depository employees shown in the picture taken by Dillard were\r\non the fifth floor of the building when the shots were fired: James\r\nJarman, Jr., age 34, a wrapper in the shipping department; Bonnie Ray\r\nWilliams, age 20, a warehouseman temporarily assigned to laying a\r\nplywood floor on the sixth floor; and Harold Norman, age 26, an “order\r\nfiller.” Norman and Jarman decided to watch the parade during the lunch\r\nhour from the fifth-floor windows.[C3-40] From the ground floor they\r\ntook the west elevator, which operates with push-button controls, to\r\nthe fifth floor.[C3-41] Meanwhile, Williams had gone up to the sixth\r\nfloor where he had been working and ate his lunch on the south side of\r\nthat floor. Since he saw no one around when he finished his lunch, he\r\nstarted down on the east elevator, looking for company. He left behind\r\nhis paper lunch sack, chicken bones and an empty pop bottle.[C3-42]\r\nWilliams went down to the fifth floor, where he joined Norman and\r\nJarman at approximately 12:20 pm.[C3-43]\r\n\r\nHarold Norman was in the fifth-floor window in the southeast corner,\r\ndirectly under the window where witnesses saw the rifle. (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 485, p. 69.) He could see light through the\r\nceiling cracks between the fifth and sixth floors.[C3-44] As the\r\nmotorcade went by, Norman thought that the President was saluting with\r\nhis right arm,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 485 Positions occupied by\r\nDepository employees on fifth floor on November 22, 1963.]\r\n\r\n    * * * and I can’t remember what the exact time was but I know I\r\n    heard a shot, and then after I heard the shot, well, it seems\r\n    as though the President, you know, slumped or something, and\r\n    then another shot and I believe Jarman or someone told me,\r\n    he said, “I believe someone is shooting at the President,”\r\n    and I think I made a statement “It is someone shooting at the\r\n    President, and I believe it came from up above us.”\r\n\r\n    Well, I couldn’t see at all during the time but I know I heard\r\n    a third shot fired, and I could also hear something sounded\r\n    like the shell hulls hitting the floor and the ejecting of the\r\n    rifle * * *.[C3-45]\r\n\r\nWilliams said that he “really did not pay any attention” to the first\r\nshot--\r\n\r\n    * * * because I did not know what was happening. The second\r\n    shot, it sounded like it was right in the building, the second\r\n    and third shot. And it sounded--it even shook the building, the\r\n    side we were on. Cement fell on my head.\r\n\r\n    Q. You say cement fell on your head?\r\n\r\n    A. Cement, gravel, dirt, or something, from the old building,\r\n    because it shook the windows and everything. Harold was sitting\r\n    next to me, and he said it came right from over our head.[C3-46]\r\n\r\nWilliams testified Norman said “I can even hear the shell being ejected\r\nfrom the gun hitting the floor.”[C3-47]\r\n\r\nWhen Jarman heard the first sound, he thought that it was either a\r\nbackfire--\r\n\r\n    * * * or an officer giving a salute to the President. And then\r\n    at that time I didn’t, you know, think too much about it. * * *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Well, after the third shot was fired, I think I got up and\r\n    I run over to Harold Norman and Bonnie Ray Williams, and\r\n    told them, I said, I told them that it wasn’t a backfire or\r\n    anything, that somebody was shooting at the President.[C3-48]\r\n\r\nJarman testified that Norman said “that he thought the shots had come\r\nfrom above us, and I noticed that Bonnie Ray had a few debris in his\r\nhead. It was sort of white stuff, or something.”[C3-49] Jarman stated\r\nthat Norman said “that he was sure that the shot came from inside the\r\nbuilding because he had been used to guns and all that, and he said\r\nit didn’t sound like it was too far off anyway.”[C3-50] The three men\r\nran to the west side of the building, where they could look toward the\r\nTriple Underpass to see what had happened to the motorcade.[C3-51]\r\n\r\nAfter the men had gone to the window on the west side of the building,\r\nJarman “got to thinking about all the debris on Bonnie Ray’s head” and\r\nsaid, “That shot probably did come from upstairs, up over us.”[C3-52]\r\nHe testified that Norman said, “I know it did, because I could hear\r\nthe action of the bolt, and I could hear the cartridges drop on the\r\nfloor.”[C3-53] After pausing for a few minutes, the three men ran\r\ndownstairs. Norman and Jarman ran out of the front entrance of the\r\nbuilding, where they saw Brennan, the construction worker who had seen\r\nthe man in the window firing the gun, talking to a police officer, and\r\nthey then reported their own experience.[C3-54]\r\n\r\nOn March 20, 1964, preceding their appearance before the Commission,\r\nthese witnesses were interviewed in Dallas. At that time members of the\r\nCommission’s legal staff conducted an experiment. Norman, Williams,\r\nand Jarman placed themselves at the windows of the fifth floor as they\r\nhad been on November 22. A Secret Service agent operated the bolt of\r\na rifle directly above them at the southeast corner window of the\r\nsixth floor. At the same time, three cartridge shells were dropped to\r\nthe floor at intervals of about 3 seconds. According to Norman, the\r\nnoise outside was less on the day of the assassination than on the day\r\nof the test.[C3-55] He testified, “Well, I heard the same sound, the\r\nsound similar. I heard three something that he dropped on the floor and\r\nthen I could hear the rifle or whatever he had up there.”[C3-56] The\r\nexperiment with the shells and rifle was repeated for members of the\r\nCommission on May 9, 1964, on June 7, 1964, and again on September 6,\r\n1964. All seven of the Commissioners clearly heard the shells drop to\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Triple Underpass\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the testimony of the witnesses who heard and observed\r\nshots fired from the Depository, the Commission’s investigation has\r\ndisclosed no credible evidence that any shots were fired from anywhere\r\nelse. When the shots were fired, many people near the Depository\r\nbelieved that the shots came from the railroad bridge over the Triple\r\nUnderpass or from the area to the west of the Depository.[C3-57] In\r\nthe hectic moments after the assassination, many spectators ran in\r\nthe general direction of the Triple Underpass or the railroad yards\r\nnorthwest of the building. Some were running toward the place from\r\nwhich the sound of the rifle fire appeared to come, others were fleeing\r\nthe scene of the shooting.[C3-58] None of these people saw anyone with\r\na rifle, and the Commission’s inquiry has yielded no evidence that\r\nshots were fired from the bridge over the Triple Underpass or from the\r\nrailroad yards.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the motorcade, Patrolman J. W. Foster stood on the east\r\nside of the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass and Patrolman\r\nJ. C. White stood on the west side.[C3-59] Patrolman Joe E. Murphy\r\nwas standing over Elm Street on the Stemmons Freeway overpass, west\r\nof the railroad bridge farther away from the Depository.[C3-60] Two\r\nother officers were stationed on Stemmons Freeway to control traffic\r\nas the motorcade entered the Freeway.[C3-61] Under the advance\r\npreparations worked out between the Secret Service and the Dallas\r\nPolice Department, the policemen were under instructions to keep\r\n“unauthorized” people away from these locations.[C3-62] When the\r\nmotorcade reached the intersection of Elm and Houston Streets, there\r\nwere no spectators on Stemmons Freeway where Patrolman Murphy was\r\nstationed.[C3-63] Patrolman Foster estimated that there were 10 or 11\r\npeople on the railroad bridge where he was assigned;[C3-64] another\r\nwitness testified that there were between 14 and 18 people there as the\r\nmotorcade came into view.[C3-65] Investigation has disclosed 15 persons\r\nwho were on the railroad bridge at this time, including 2 policemen,\r\n2 employees of the Texas-Louisiana Freight Bureau and 11 employees of\r\nthe Union Terminal Co.[C3-66] In the absence of any explicit definition\r\nof “unauthorized” persons, the policemen permitted these employees to\r\nremain on the railroad bridge to watch the motorcade. (See chapter\r\nVIII, pp. 446-447.) At the request of the policemen, S.M. Holland,\r\nsignal supervisor for Union Terminal Co., came to the railroad bridge\r\nat about 11:45 a.m. and remained to identify those persons who were\r\nrailroad employees.[C3-67] In addition, Patrolman Foster checked\r\ncredentials to determine if persons seeking access to the bridge were\r\nrailroad employees.[C3-68] Persons who were not railroad employees were\r\nordered away, including one news photographer who wished only to take a\r\npicture of the motorcade.[C3-69]\r\n\r\nAnother employee of the Union Terminal Co., Lee E. Bowers, Jr., was at\r\nwork in a railroad tower about 14 feet above the tracks to the north\r\nof the railroad bridge and northwest of the corner of Elm and Houston,\r\napproximately 50 yards from the back of the Depository.[C3-70] (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 2218, p. 73.) From the tower he could view\r\npeople moving in the railroad yards and at the rear of the Depository.\r\nAccording to Bowers, “Since approximately 10 o’clock in the morning\r\ntraffic had been cut off into the area so that anyone moving around\r\ncould actually be observed.”[C3-71] During the 20 minutes prior to\r\nthe arrival of the motorcade, Bowers noticed three automobiles which\r\nentered his immediate area; two left without discharging any passengers\r\nand the third was apparently on its way out when last observed by\r\nBowers.[C3-72] Bowers observed only three or four people in the general\r\narea, as well as a few bystanders on the railroad bridge over the\r\nTriple Underpass.[C3-73]\r\n\r\nAs the motorcade proceeded toward the Triple Underpass, the spectators\r\nwere clustered together along the east concrete wall of the railroad\r\nbridge facing the oncoming procession.[C3-74] (See Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 2215, p. 75.) Patrolman Foster stood immediately behind them and\r\ncould observe all of them.[C3-75] Secret Service agents in the lead car\r\nof the motorcade observed the bystanders and the police officer on the\r\nbridge.[C3-76] Special Agent Winston G. Lawson motioned through the\r\nwindshield in an unsuccessful attempt to instruct Patrolman Foster to\r\nmove the people away from their position directly over the path of the\r\nmotorcade.[C3-77] Some distance away, on the Stemmons Freeway overpass\r\nabove Elm Street, Patrolman Murphy also had the group on the railroad\r\nbridge within view.[C3-78] When he heard the shots, Foster rushed to\r\nthe wall of the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass and looked\r\ntoward the street.[C3-79] After the third shot, Foster ran toward the\r\nDepository and shortly thereafter informed Inspector Herbert J. Sawyer\r\nof the Dallas Police Department that he thought the shots came from the\r\nvicinity of Elm and Houston.[C3-80]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2118\r\n\r\nVIEW FROM NORTH TOWER OF UNION TERMINAL COMPANY, DALLAS, TEXAS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2214\r\n\r\nVIEW FROM TRIPLE UNDERPASS, DALLAS, TEXAS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2215\r\n\r\nVIEW OF TRIPLE UNDERPASS FROM LOCATION ON ELM STREET\r\n\r\n(BETWEEN ZAPRUDER FRAMES 272-280)]\r\n\r\nOther witnesses on the railroad bridge had varying views concerning\r\nthe source and number of the shots. Austin L. Miller, employed by the\r\nTexas-Louisiana Freight Bureau, heard three shots and thought that they\r\ncame from the area of the Presidential limousine itself.[C3-81] One of\r\nhis coworkers, Royce G. Skelton, thought he heard four shots, but could\r\nnot tell their exact source.[C3-82] Frank E. Reilly, an electrician\r\nat Union Terminal, heard three shots which seemed to come from the\r\ntrees “On the north side of Elm Street at the corner up there.”[C3-83]\r\nAccording to S.M. Holland, there were four shots which sounded as\r\nthough they came from the trees on the north side of Elm Street where\r\nhe saw a puff of smoke.[C3-84] Thomas J. Murphy, a mail foreman at\r\nUnion Terminal Co., heard two shots and said that they came from a\r\nspot just west of the Depository.[C3-85] In the railroad tower, Bowers\r\nheard three shots, which sounded as though they came either from the\r\nDepository Building or near the mouth of the Triple Underpass. Prior\r\nto November 22, 1963, Bowers had noted the similarity of the sounds\r\ncoming from the vicinity of the Depository and those from the Triple\r\nUnderpass, which he attributed to “a reverberation which takes place\r\nfrom either location.”[C3-86]\r\n\r\nImmediately after the shots were fired, neither the policemen nor\r\nthe spectators on the railroad bridge over the Triple Underpass saw\r\nanything suspicious on the bridge in their vicinity. (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 2214, p. 74.) No one saw anyone with a rifle. As he ran\r\naround through the railroad yards to the Depository, Patrolman Foster\r\nsaw no suspicious activity.[C3-87] The same was true of the other\r\nbystanders, many of whom made an effort after the shooting to observe\r\nany unusual activity. Holland, for example, immediately after the\r\nshots, ran off the overpass to see if there was anyone behind the\r\npicket fence on the north side of Elm Street, but he did not see anyone\r\namong the parked cars.[C3-88] Miller did not see anyone running across\r\nthe railroad tracks or on the plaza west of the Depository.[C3-89]\r\nBowers and others saw a motorcycle officer dismount hurriedly and\r\ncome running up the incline on the north side of Elm Street.[C3-90]\r\nThe motorcycle officer, Clyde A. Haygood, saw no one running from the\r\nrailroad yards.[C3-91]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL AUTOMOBILE\r\n\r\nAfter the Presidential car was returned to Washington on November 22,\r\n1963, Secret Service agents found two bullet fragments in the front\r\nseat. One fragment, found on the seat beside the driver, weighed 44.6\r\ngrains and consisted of the nose portion of a bullet.[C3-92] The\r\nother fragment, found along the right side of the front seat, weighed\r\n21.0 grains and consisted of the base portion of a bullet.[C3-93]\r\nDuring the course of an examination on November 23, agents of the\r\nFederal Bureau of Investigation found three small lead particles,\r\nweighing between seven-tenths and nine-tenths of a grain each, on the\r\nrug underneath the left jump seat which had been occupied by Mrs.\r\nConnally.[C3-94] During this examination, the Bureau agents noted a\r\nsmall residue of lead on the inside surface of the laminated windshield\r\nand a very small pattern of cracks on the outer layer of the windshield\r\nimmediately behind the lead residue.[C3-95] There was a minute particle\r\nof glass missing from the outside surface, but no penetration. The\r\ninside layer of glass was not broken.[C3-96] The agents also observed a\r\ndent in the strip of chrome across the top of the windshield, located\r\nto the left of the rear view mirror support.[C3-97]\r\n\r\nThe lead residue on the inside of the windshield was compared under\r\nspectrographic analysis by FBI experts with the bullet fragments\r\nfound on and alongside the front seat and with the fragments under\r\nthe left jump seat. It was also compared with bullet fragments found\r\nat Parkland Hospital. All these bullet fragments were found to be\r\nsimilar in metallic composition, but it was not possible to determine\r\nwhether two or more of the fragments came from the same bullet.[C3-98]\r\nIt is possible for the fragments from the front seat to have been a\r\npart of the same bullet as the three fragments found near the left\r\njump seat,[C3-99] since a whole bullet of this type weighs 160-161\r\ngrains.[C3-100] (See app. X, pp. 555-558.)\r\n\r\nThe physical characteristics of the windshield after the assassination\r\ndemonstrate that the windshield was struck on the inside surface. The\r\nwindshield is composed of two layers of glass with a very thin layer\r\nof plastic in the middle “which bonds them together in the form of\r\nsafety glass.”[C3-101] The windshield was extracted from the automobile\r\nand was examined during a Commission hearing.[C3-102] (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 350, p. 78.) According to Robert A. Frazier, FBI firearms\r\nexpert, the fact that cracks were present on the outer layer of glass\r\nshowed that the glass had been struck from the inside. He testified\r\nthat the windshield\r\n\r\n    could not have been struck on the outside surface because of\r\n    the manner in which the glass broke and further because of the\r\n    lead residue on the inside surface. The cracks appear in the\r\n    outer layer of the glass because the glass is bent outward at\r\n    the time of impact which stretches the outer layer of the glass\r\n    to the point where these small radial or wagon spoke, wagon\r\n    wheel spoke-type cracks appear on the outer surface.[C3-103]\r\n\r\nAlthough there is some uncertainty whether the dent in the chrome on\r\nthe windshield was present prior to the assassination,[C3-104] Frazier\r\ntestified that the dent “had been caused by some projectile which\r\nstruck the chrome on the inside surface.”[C3-105] If it was caused\r\nby a shot during the assassination, Frazier stated that it would not\r\nhave been caused by a bullet traveling at full velocity, but rather\r\nby a fragment traveling at “fairly high velocity.”[C3-106] It could\r\nhave been caused by either fragment found in the front seat of the\r\nlimousine.[C3-107]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 350\r\n\r\nWindshield of Presidential limousine.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERT EXAMINATION OF RIFLE, CARTRIDGE CASES, AND BULLET FRAGMENTS\r\n\r\nOn the sixth floor of the Depository Building, the Dallas police\r\nfound three spent cartridges and a rifle. A nearly whole bullet was\r\ndiscovered on the stretcher used to carry Governor Connally at Parkland\r\nHospital. As described in the preceding section, five bullet fragments\r\nwere found in the President’s limousine. The cartridge cases, the\r\nnearly whole bullet and the bullet fragments were all subjected to\r\nfirearms identification analysis by qualified experts. It was the\r\nunanimous opinion of the experts that the nearly whole bullet, the two\r\nlargest bullet fragments and the three cartridge cases were definitely\r\nfired in the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building\r\nto the exclusion of all other weapons.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscovery of Cartridge Cases and Rifle\r\n\r\nShortly after the assassination, police officers arrived at the\r\nDepository Building and began a search for the assassin and\r\nevidence.[C3-108] Around 1 p.m. Deputy Sheriff Luke Mooney noticed a\r\npile of cartons in front of the window in the southeast corner of the\r\nsixth floor.[C3-109] (See Commission Exhibit No. 723, p. 80.) Searching\r\nthat area he found at approximately 1:12 p.m. three empty cartridge\r\ncases on the floor near the window.[C3-110] When he was notified of\r\nMooney’s discovery, Capt. J. W. Fritz, chief of the homicide bureau of\r\nthe Dallas Police Department, issued instructions that nothing be moved\r\nor touched until technicians from the police crime laboratory could\r\ntake photographs and check for fingerprints.[C3-111] Mooney stood guard\r\nto see that nothing was disturbed.[C3-112] A few minutes later, Lt.\r\nJ. C. Day of the Dallas Police Department arrived and took photographs\r\nof the cartridge cases before anything had been moved.[C3-113]\r\n\r\nAt 1:22 p.m. Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone and Deputy Constable Seymour\r\nWeitzman found a bolt-action rifle with a telescopic sight between two\r\nrows of boxes in the northwest corner near the staircase on the sixth\r\nfloor.[C3-114] No one touched the weapon or otherwise disturbed the\r\nscene until Captain Fritz and Lieutenant Day arrived and the weapon\r\nwas photographed as it lay on the floor.[C3-115] After Lieutenant Day\r\ndetermined that there were no fingerprints on the knob of the bolt and\r\nthat the wooden stock was too rough to take fingerprints, he picked the\r\nrifle up by the stock and held it that way while Captain Fritz opened\r\nthe bolt and ejected a live round.[C3-116] Lieutenant Day retained\r\npossession of the weapon and took it back to the police department\r\nfor examination.[C3-117] Neither Boone nor Weitzman handled the\r\nrifle.[C3-118]\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscovery of Bullet at Parkland Hospital\r\n\r\nA nearly whole bullet was found on Governor Connally’s stretcher\r\nat Parkland Hospital after the assassination. After his arrival at\r\nthe hospital the Governor was brought into trauma room No. 2 on a\r\nstretcher, removed from the room on that stretcher a short time later,\r\nand taken on an elevator to the second-floor operating room.[C3-119] On\r\nthe second floor he was transferred from the stretcher to an operating\r\ntable which was then moved into the operating room, and a hospital\r\nattendant wheeled the empty stretcher into an elevator.[C3-120] Shortly\r\nafterward, Darrell C. Tomlinson, the hospital’s senior engineer,\r\nremoved this stretcher from the elevator and placed it in the corridor\r\non the ground floor, alongside another stretcher wholly unconnected\r\nwith the care of Governor Connally.[C3-121] A few minutes later, he\r\nbumped one of the stretchers against the wall and a bullet rolled\r\nout.[C3-122]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 723\r\n\r\nShield of cartons around sixth floor southeast corner window.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Tomlinson was not certain whether the bullet came from the\r\nConnally stretcher or the adjacent one, the Commission has concluded\r\nthat the bullet came from the Governor’s stretcher. That conclusion is\r\nbuttressed by evidence which eliminated President Kennedy’s stretcher\r\nas a source of the bullet. President Kennedy remained on the stretcher\r\non which he was carried into the hospital while the doctors tried to\r\nsave his life.[C3-123] He was never removed from the stretcher from the\r\ntime he was taken into the emergency room until his body was placed\r\nin a casket in that same room.[C3-124] After the President’s body\r\nwas removed from that stretcher, the linen was taken off and placed\r\nin a hamper and the stretcher was pushed into trauma room No. 2, a\r\ncompletely different location from the site where the nearly whole\r\nbullet was found.[C3-125]\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of Rifle\r\n\r\nThe bolt-action, clip-fed rifle found on the sixth floor of the\r\nDepository, described more fully in appendix X, is inscribed with\r\nvarious markings, including “MADE ITALY,” “CAL. 6.5,” “1940” and the\r\nnumber C2766.[C3-126] (See Commission Exhibit Nos. 1303, 541(2) and\r\n541(3), pp. 82-83.) These markings have been explained as follows:\r\n“MADE ITALY” refers to its origin; “CAL. 6.5” refers to the rifle’s\r\ncaliber; “1940” refers to the year of manufacture; and the number\r\nC2766 is the serial number. This rifle is the only one of its type\r\nbearing that serial number.[C3-127] After review of standard reference\r\nworks and the markings on the rifle, it was identified by the FBI as a\r\n6.5-millimeter model 91/38 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.[C3-128] Experts\r\nfrom the FBI made an independent determination of the caliber by\r\ninserting a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter cartridge into the weapon\r\nfor fit, and by making a sulfur cast of the inside of the weapon’s\r\nbarrel and measuring the cast with a micrometer.[C3-129] From outward\r\nappearance, the weapon would appear to be a 7.35-millimeter rifle, but\r\nits mechanism had been rebarreled with a 6.5-millimeter barrel.[C3-130]\r\nConstable Deputy Sheriff Weitzman, who only saw the rifle at a glance\r\nand did not handle it, thought the weapon looked like a 7.65 Mauser\r\nbolt-action rifle.[C3-131] (See chapter V, p. 235.)\r\n\r\nThe rifle is 40.2 inches long and weighs 8 pounds.[C3-132] The\r\nminimum length broken down is 34.8 inches, the length of the wooden\r\nstock.[C3-133] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1304, p. 132.) Attached\r\nto the weapon is an inexpensive four-power telescopic sight,\r\nstamped “Optics Ordnance Inc./Hollywood California,” and “Made in\r\nJapan.”[C3-134] The weapon also bears a sling consisting of two leather\r\nstraps. The sling is not a standard rifle sling but appears to be a\r\nmusical instrument strap or a sling from a carrying case or camera\r\nbag.[C3-135]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1303]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBITS NOS. 541(2) AND 541(3)\r\n\r\nPhotograph of markings on C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.]\r\n\r\n\r\nExpert Testimony\r\n\r\nFour experts in the field of firearms identification analyzed the\r\nnearly whole bullet, the two largest fragments and the three cartridge\r\ncases to determine whether they had been fired from the C2766\r\nMannlicher-Carcano rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository.\r\nTwo of these experts testified before the Commission. One was Robert A.\r\nFrazier, a special agent of the FBI assigned to the FBI Laboratory in\r\nWashington, D.C. Frazier has worked generally in the field of firearms\r\nidentification for 23 years, examining firearms of various types for\r\nthe purpose of identifying the caliber and other characteristics of the\r\nweapons and making comparisons of bullets and cartridge cases for the\r\npurpose of determining whether or not they were fired in a particular\r\nweapon.[C3-136] He estimated that he has made “in the neighborhood of\r\n50,000 to 60,000” firearms comparisons and has testified in court on\r\nabout 400 occasions.[C3-137] The second witness who testified on this\r\nsubject was Joseph D. Nicol, superintendent of the bureau of criminal\r\nidentification and investigation for the State of Illinois. Nicol\r\nalso has had long and substantial experience since 1941 in firearms\r\nidentification, and estimated that he has made thousands of bullet and\r\ncartridge case examinations.[C3-138]\r\n\r\nIn examining the bullet fragments and cartridge cases, these experts\r\napplied the general principles accepted in the field of firearms\r\nidentification, which are discussed in more detail in appendix X at\r\npages 547-553. In brief, a determination that a particular bullet or\r\ncartridge case has been fired in a particular weapon is based upon a\r\ncomparison of the bullet or case under examination with one or more\r\nbullets or cases known to have been fired in that weapon. When a bullet\r\nis fired in any given weapon, it is engraved with the characteristics\r\nof the weapon. In addition to the rifling characteristics of the\r\nbarrel which are common to all weapons of a given make and model,\r\nevery weapon bears distinctive microscopic markings on its barrel,\r\nfiring pin and bolt face.[C3-139] These markings arise initially\r\nduring manufacture, since the action of the manufacturing tools\r\ndiffers microscopically from weapon to weapon and since, in addition,\r\nthe tools change microscopically while being used. As a weapon is\r\nused further distinctive markings are introduced. Under microscopic\r\nexamination a qualified expert may be able to determine whether the\r\nmarkings on a bullet known to have been fired in a particular weapon\r\nand the markings on a suspect bullet are the same and, therefore,\r\nwhether both bullets were fired in the same weapon to the exclusion\r\nof all other weapons. Similarly, firearms identification experts are\r\nable to compare the markings left upon the base of cartridge cases and\r\nthereby determine whether both cartridges were fired by the same weapon\r\nto the exclusion of all other weapons. According to Frazier, such\r\nan identification “is made on the presence of sufficient individual\r\nmicroscopic characteristics so that a very definite pattern is formed\r\nand visualized on the two surfaces.”[C3-140] Under some circumstances,\r\nas where the bullet or cartridge case is seriously mutilated, there are\r\nnot sufficient individual characteristics to enable the expert to make\r\na firm identification.[C3-141]\r\n\r\nAfter making independent examinations, both Frazier and Nicol\r\npositively identified the nearly whole bullet from the stretcher and\r\nthe two larger bullet fragments found in the Presidential limousine as\r\nhaving been fired in the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the\r\nDepository to the exclusion of all other weapons.[C3-142] Each of the\r\ntwo bullet fragments had sufficient unmutilated area to provide the\r\nbasis for an identification.[C3-143] However, it was not possible to\r\ndetermine whether the two bullet fragments were from the same bullet\r\nor from two different bullets.[C3-144] With regard to the other bullet\r\nfragments discovered in the limousine and in the course of treating\r\nPresident Kennedy and Governor Connally, however, expert examination\r\ncould demonstrate only that the fragments were “similar in metallic\r\ncomposition” to each other, to the two larger fragments and to the\r\nnearly whole bullet.[C3-145] After examination of the three cartridge\r\ncases found on the sixth floor of the Depository, Frazier and Nicol\r\nconcluded that they had been fired in the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano\r\nrifle to the exclusion of all other weapons.[C3-146] Two other experts\r\nfrom the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who made independent\r\nexaminations of the nearly whole bullet, bullet fragments and cartridge\r\ncases, reached the identical conclusions.[C3-147]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BULLET WOUNDS\r\n\r\nIn considering the question of the source of the shots fired at\r\nPresident Kennedy and Governor Connally, the Commission has also\r\nevaluated the expert medical testimony of the doctors who observed\r\nthe wounds during the emergency treatment at Parkland Hospital and\r\nduring the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital. It paid particular\r\nattention to any wound characteristics which would be of assistance\r\nin identifying a wound as the entrance or exit point of a missile.\r\nAdditional information regarding the source and nature of the injuries\r\nwas obtained by expert examination of the clothes worn by the two men,\r\nparticularly those worn by President Kennedy, and from the results of\r\nspecial wound ballistics tests conducted at the Commission’s request,\r\nusing the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle with ammunition of the same\r\ntype as that used and found on November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President’s Head Wounds\r\n\r\nThe detailed autopsy of President Kennedy performed on the night of\r\nNovember 22 at the Bethesda Naval Hospital led the three examining\r\npathologists to conclude that the smaller hole in the rear of the\r\nPresident’s skull was the point of entry and that the large opening on\r\nthe right side of his head was the wound of exit.[C3-148] The smaller\r\nhole on the back of the President’s head measured one-fourth of an\r\ninch by five-eighths of an inch (6 by 15 millimeters).[C3-149] The\r\ndimensions of that wound were consistent with having been caused by\r\na 6.5-millimeter bullet fired from behind and above which struck at\r\na tangent or an angle causing a 15-millimeter cut. The cut reflected\r\na larger dimension of entry than the bullet’s diameter of 6.5\r\nmillimeters, since the missile, in effect, sliced along the skull for\r\na fractional distance until it entered.[C3-150] The dimension of 6\r\nmillimeters, somewhat smaller than the diameter of a 6.5-millimeter\r\nbullet, was caused by the elastic recoil of the skull which shrinks the\r\nsize of an opening after a missile passes through it.[C3-151]\r\n\r\nLt. Col. Pierre A. Finck, Chief of the Wound Ballistics Pathology\r\nBranch of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, who has\r\nhad extensive experience with bullet wounds, illustrated the\r\ncharacteristics which led to his conclusions about the head wound by\r\na chart prepared by him. This chart, based on Colonel Finck’s studies\r\nof more than 400 cases, depicted the effect of a perforating missile\r\nwound on the human skull.[C3-152] When a bullet enters the skull\r\n(cranial vault) at one point and exits at another, it causes a beveling\r\nor cratering effect where the diameter of the hole is smaller on the\r\nimpact side than on the exit side. Based on his observations of that\r\nbeveling effect on the President’s skull, Colonel Finck testified:\r\n“President Kennedy was, in my opinion, shot from the rear. The bullet\r\nentered in the back of the head and went out on the right side of his\r\nskull * * * he was shot from above and behind.”[C3-153]\r\n\r\nComdr. James J. Humes, senior pathologist and director of laboratories\r\nat the Bethesda Naval Hospital, who acted as chief autopsy surgeon,\r\nconcurred in Colonel Finck’s analysis. He compared the beveling or\r\nconing effect to that caused by a BB shot which strikes a pane of\r\nglass, causing a round or oval defect on the side of the glass where\r\nthe missile strikes and a belled-out or coned-out surface on the\r\nopposite side of the glass.[C3-154] Referring to the bullet hole on the\r\nback of President Kennedy’s head, Commander Humes testified: “The wound\r\non the inner table, however, was larger and had what in the field of\r\nwound ballistics is described as a shelving or coning effect.”[C3-155]\r\nAfter studying the other hole in the President’s skull, Commander Humes\r\nstated: “* * * we concluded that the large defect to the upper right\r\nside of the skull, in fact, would represent a wound of exit.”[C3-156]\r\nThose characteristics led Commander Humes and Comdr. J. Thornton\r\nBoswell, chief of pathology at Bethesda Naval Hospital, who assisted\r\nin the autopsy, to conclude that the bullet penetrated the rear of the\r\nPresident’s head and exited through a large wound on the right side of\r\nhis head.[C3-157]\r\n\r\nBallistics experiments (discussed more fully in app. X, pp. 585-586)\r\nshowed that the rifle and bullets identified above were capable of\r\nproducing the President’s head wound. The Wound Ballistics Branch of\r\nthe U.S. Army laboratories at Edgewood Arsenal, Md., conducted an\r\nextensive series of experiments to test the effect of Western Cartridge\r\nCo. 6.5-millimeter bullets, the type found on Governor Connally’s\r\nstretcher and in the Presidential limousine, fired from the C2766\r\nMannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the Depository. The Edgewood Arsenal\r\ntests were performed under the immediate supervision of Alfred G.\r\nOlivier, a doctor who had spent 7 years in wounds ballistics research\r\nfor the U.S. Army.[C3-158]\r\n\r\nOne series of tests, performed on reconstructed inert human skulls,\r\ndemonstrated that the President’s head wound could have been caused\r\nby the rifle and bullets fired by the assassin from the sixth-floor\r\nwindow. The results of this series were illustrated by the findings on\r\none skull which was struck at a point closely approximating the wound\r\nof entry on President Kennedy’s head. That bullet blew out the right\r\nside of the reconstructed skull in a manner very similar to the head\r\nwound of the President.[C3-159] As a result of these tests, Dr. Olivier\r\nconcluded that a Western Cartridge Co. 6.5 bullet fired from the C2766\r\nMannlicher-Carcano rifle at a distance of 90 yards would make the same\r\ntype of wound as that found on the President’s head. Referring to the\r\nseries of tests, Dr. Olivier testified:\r\n\r\n    It disclosed that the type of head wounds that the President\r\n    received could be done by this type of bullet. This surprised\r\n    me very much, because this type of stable bullet I didn’t\r\n    think would cause a massive head wound, I thought it would go\r\n    through making a small entrance and exit, but the bones of the\r\n    skull are enough to deform the end of this bullet causing it to\r\n    expend a lot of energy and blowing out the side of the skull or\r\n    blowing out fragments of the skull.[C3-160]\r\n\r\nAfter examining the fragments of the bullet which struck the\r\nreconstructed skull, Dr. Olivier stated that--\r\n\r\n    the recovered fragments were very similar to the ones recovered\r\n    on the front seat and on the floor of the car.\r\n\r\n    This, to me, indicates that those fragments did come from the\r\n    bullet that wounded the President in the head.[C3-161]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President’s Neck Wounds\r\n\r\nDuring the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital another bullet wound\r\nwas observed near the base of the back of President Kennedy’s neck\r\nslightly to the right of his spine which provides further enlightenment\r\nas to the source of the shots. The hole was located approximately 5½\r\ninches (14 centimeters) from the tip of the right shoulder joint and\r\napproximately the same distance below the tip of the right mastoid\r\nprocess, the bony point immediately behind the ear.[C3-162] The\r\nwound was approximately one-fourth by one-seventh of an inch (7 by\r\n4 millimeters), had clean edges, was sharply delineated, and had\r\nmargins similar in all respects to those of the entry wound in the\r\nskull.[C3-163] Commanders Humes and Boswell agreed with Colonel Finck’s\r\ntestimony that this hole--\r\n\r\n    * * * is a wound of entrance. * * * The basis for that\r\n    conclusion is that this wound was relatively small with clean\r\n    edges. It was not a jagged wound, and that is what we see in\r\n    wound of entrance at a long range.[C3-164]\r\n\r\nThe autopsy examination further disclosed that, after entering the\r\nPresident, the bullet passed between two large muscles, produced a\r\ncontusion on the upper part of the pleural cavity (without penetrating\r\nthat cavity), bruised the top portion of the right lung and ripped the\r\nwindpipe (trachea) in its path through the President’s neck.[C3-165]\r\nThe examining surgeons concluded that the wounds were caused by the\r\nbullet rather than the tracheotomy performed at Parkland Hospital.\r\nThe nature of the bruises indicated that the President’s heart and\r\nlungs were functioning when the bruises were caused, whereas there\r\nwas very little circulation in the President’s body when incisions\r\non the President’s chest were made to insert tubes during the\r\ntracheotomy.[C3-166] No bone was struck by the bullet which passed\r\nthrough the President’s body.[C3-167] By projecting from a point of\r\nentry on the rear of the neck and proceeding at a slight downward angle\r\nthrough the bruised interior portions, the doctors concluded that the\r\nbullet exited from the front portion of the President’s neck that had\r\nbeen cut away by the tracheotomy.[C3-168]\r\n\r\nConcluding that a bullet passed through the President’s neck, the\r\ndoctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital rejected a theory that the bullet\r\nlodged in the large muscles in the back of his neck and fell out\r\nthrough the point of entry when external heart massage was applied at\r\nParkland Hospital. In the earlier stages of the autopsy, the surgeons\r\nwere unable to find a path into any large muscle in the back of the\r\nneck. At that time they did not know that there had been a bullet\r\nhole in the front of the President’s neck when he arrived at Parkland\r\nHospital because the tracheotomy incision had completely eliminated\r\nthat evidence.[C3-169] While the autopsy was being performed, surgeons\r\nlearned that a whole bullet had been found at Parkland Hospital on\r\na stretcher which, at that time, was thought to be the stretcher\r\noccupied by the President. This led to speculation that the bullet\r\nmight have penetrated a short distance into the back of the neck and\r\nthen dropped out onto the stretcher as a result of the external heart\r\nmassage.[C3-170]\r\n\r\nFurther exploration during the autopsy disproved that theory. The\r\nsurgeons determined that the bullet had passed between two large strap\r\nmuscles and bruised them without leaving any channel, since the bullet\r\nmerely passed between them.[C3-171] Commander Humes, who believed\r\nthat a tracheotomy had been performed from his observations at the\r\nautopsy, talked by telephone with Dr. Perry early on the morning of\r\nNovember 23, and learned that his assumption was correct and that Dr.\r\nPerry had used the missile wound in the neck as the point to make the\r\nincision.[C3-172] This confirmed the Bethesda surgeons’ conclusion that\r\nthe bullet had exited from the front part of the neck.\r\n\r\nThe findings of the doctors who conducted the autopsy were consistent\r\nwith the observations of the doctors who treated the President at\r\nParkland Hospital. Dr. Charles S. Carrico, a resident surgeon at\r\nParkland, noted a small wound approximately one-fourth of an inch in\r\ndiameter (5 to 8 millimeters) in the lower third of the neck below\r\nthe Adam’s apple.[C3-173] Dr. Malcolm O. Perry, who performed the\r\ntracheotomy, described the wound as approximately one-fifth of an inch\r\nin diameter (5 millimeters) and exuding blood which partially hid edges\r\nthat were “neither cleancut, that is, punched out, nor were they very\r\nragged.”[C3-174] Dr. Carrico testified as follows:\r\n\r\n    Q. Based on your observations on the neck wound alone did you\r\n    have a sufficient basis to form an opinion as to whether it was\r\n    an entrance or an exit wound?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir; we did not. Not having completely evaluated all\r\n    the wounds, traced out the course of the bullets, this wound\r\n    would have been compatible with either entrance or exit wound\r\n    depending upon the size, the velocity, the tissue structure and\r\n    so forth.[C3-175]\r\n\r\nThe same response was made by Dr. Perry to a similar query:\r\n\r\n    Q. Based on the appearance of the neck wound alone, could it\r\n    have been either an entrance or an exit wound?\r\n\r\n    A. It could have been either.[C3-176]\r\n\r\nThen each doctor was asked to take into account the other known facts,\r\nsuch as the autopsy findings, the approximate distance the bullet\r\ntraveled and tested muzzle velocity of the assassination weapon. With\r\nthese additional factors, the doctors commented on the wound on the\r\nfront of the President’s neck as follows:\r\n\r\n    Dr. CARRICO. With those facts and the fact as I understand it\r\n    no other bullet was found this would be, this was, I believe,\r\n    was an exit wound.[C3-177]\r\n\r\n    Dr. PERRY. A full jacketed bullet without deformation passing\r\n    through skin would leave a similar wound for an exit and\r\n    entrance wound and with the facts which you have made available\r\n    and with these assumptions, I believe that it was an exit\r\n    wound.[C3-178]\r\n\r\nOther doctors at Parkland Hospital who observed the wound prior to\r\nthe tracheotomy agreed with the observations of Drs. Perry and\r\nCarrico.[C3-179] The bullet wound in the neck could be seen for only\r\na short time, since Dr. Perry eliminated evidence of it when he\r\nperformed the tracheotomy. He selected that spot since it was the point\r\nwhere such an operation was customarily performed, and it was one\r\nof the safest and easiest spots from which to reach the trachea. In\r\naddition, there was possibly an underlying wound to the muscles in the\r\nneck, the carotid artery or the jugular vein, and Dr. Perry concluded\r\nthat the incision, therefore, had to be low in order to maintain\r\nrespiration.[C3-180]\r\n\r\nConsiderable confusion has arisen because of comments attributed to\r\nDr. Perry concerning the nature of the neck wound. Immediately after\r\nthe assassination, many people reached erroneous conclusions about the\r\nsource of the shots because of Dr. Perry’s observations to the press.\r\nOn the afternoon of November 22, a press conference was organized\r\nat Parkland Hospital by members of the White House press staff and\r\na hospital administrator. Newsmen with microphones and cameras were\r\ncrowded into a room to hear statements by Drs. Perry and William\r\nKemp Clark, chief neurosurgeon at Parkland, who had attended to\r\nPresident Kennedy’s head injury. Dr. Perry described the situation as\r\n“bedlam.”[C3-181] The confusion was compounded by the fact that some\r\nquestions were only partially answered before other questions were\r\nasked.[C3-182]\r\n\r\nAt the news conference, Dr. Perry answered a series of hypothetical\r\nquestions and stated to the press that a variety of possibilities\r\ncould account for the President’s wounds. He stated that a single\r\nbullet could have caused the President’s wounds by entering through\r\nthe throat, striking the spine, and being deflected upward with the\r\npoint of exit being through the head.[C3-183] This would have accounted\r\nfor the two wounds he observed, the hole in the front of the neck and\r\nthe large opening in the skull. At that time, Dr. Perry did not know\r\nabout either the wound on the back of the President’s neck or the small\r\nbullet-hole wound in the back of the head. As described in chapter\r\nII, the President was lying on his back during his entire time at\r\nParkland. The small hole in the head was also hidden from view by the\r\nlarge quantity of blood which covered the President’s head. Dr. Perry\r\nsaid his answers at the press conference were intended to convey his\r\ntheory about what could have happened, based on his limited knowledge\r\nat the time, rather than his professional opinion about what did\r\nhappen.[C3-184] Commenting on his answers at the press conference, Dr.\r\nPerry testified before the Commission:\r\n\r\n    I expressed it [his answers] as a matter of speculation that\r\n    this was conceivable. But, again, Dr. Clark [who also answered\r\n    questions at the conference] and I emphasized that we had no\r\n    way of knowing.[C3-185]\r\n\r\nDr. Perry’s recollection of his comments is corroborated by some of the\r\nnews stories after the press conference. The New York Herald Tribune on\r\nNovember 23, 1963, reported as follows:\r\n\r\n     Dr. Malcolm Perry, 34, attendant surgeon at Parkland Hospital\r\n    who attended the President, said he saw two wounds--one below\r\n    the Adam’s apple, the other at the back of the head. He said he\r\n    did not know if two bullets were involved. It is possible, he\r\n    said, that the neck wound was the entrance and the other the\r\n    exit of the missile.[C3-186]\r\n\r\nAccording to this report, Dr. Perry stated merely that it was\r\n“possible” that the neck wound was a wound of entrance. This conforms\r\nwith his testimony before the Commission, where he stated that by\r\nthemselves the characteristics of the neck wound were consistent with\r\nbeing either a point of entry or exit.\r\n\r\n_Wound ballistics tests._--Experiments performed by the Army Wound\r\nBallistics experts at Edgewood Arsenal, Md. (discussed in app. X, p.\r\n582) showed that under simulated conditions entry and exit wounds are\r\nvery similar in appearance. After reviewing the path of the bullet\r\nthrough the President’s neck, as disclosed in the autopsy report,\r\nthe experts simulated the neck by using comparable material with a\r\nthickness of approximately 5½ inches (13½ to 14½ centimeters), which\r\nwas the distance traversed by the bullet. Animal skin was placed on\r\neach side, and Western Cartridge Co. 6.5 bullets were fired from the\r\nC2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle from a distance of 180 feet. The animal\r\nskin on the entry side showed holes which were regular and round.\r\nOn the exit side two holes were only slightly elongated, indicating\r\nthat the bullet had become only a little unstable at the point of\r\nexit.[C3-187] A third exit hole was round, although not quite as\r\nregular as the entry holes.[C3-188] The exit holes, especially the\r\none most nearly round, appeared similar to the descriptions given by\r\nDrs. Perry and Carrico of the hole in the front of the President’s\r\nneck.[C3-189]\r\n\r\nThe autopsy disclosed that the bullet which entered the back of the\r\nPresident’s neck hit no bony structure and proceeded in a slightly\r\ndownward angle. The markings on the President’s clothing indicate\r\nthat the bullet moved in a slight right to left lateral direction as\r\nit passed through the President’s body.[C3-190] After the examining\r\ndoctors expressed the thought that a bullet would have lost very\r\nlittle velocity in passing through the soft tissue of the neck, wound\r\nballistics experts conducted tests to measure the exit velocity of\r\nthe bullet.[C3-191] The tests were the same as those used to create\r\nentry and exit holes, supplemented by the use of break-type screens\r\nwhich measured the velocity of bullets. The entrance velocity of the\r\nbullet fired from the rifle averaged 1,904 feet per second after it\r\ntraveled 180 feet. The exit velocity averaged 1,772 to 1,798 feet per\r\nsecond, depending upon the substance through which the bullet passed.\r\nA photograph of the path of the bullet traveling through the simulated\r\nneck showed that it proceeded in a straight line and was stable.[C3-192]\r\n\r\n_Examination of clothing._--The clothing worn by President Kennedy on\r\nNovember 22 had holes and tears which showed that a missile entered\r\nthe back of his clothing in the vicinity of his lower neck and exited\r\nthrough the front of his shirt immediately behind his tie, nicking the\r\nknot of his tie in its forward flight.[C3-193] Although the caliber\r\nof the bullet could not be determined and some of the clothing items\r\nprecluded a positive determination that some tears were made by a\r\nbullet, all the defects could have been caused by a 6.5-millimeter\r\nbullet entering the back of the President’s lower neck and exiting in\r\nthe area of the knot of his tie.[C3-194]\r\n\r\nAn examination of the suit jacket worn by the President by FBI Agent\r\nFrazier revealed a roughly circular hole approximately one-fourth of\r\nan inch in diameter on the rear of the coat, 5⅜ inches below the top\r\nof the collar and 1¾ inches to the right of the center back seam of\r\nthe coat.[C3-195] The hole was visible on the upper rear of the coat\r\nslightly to the right of center. Traces of copper were found in the\r\nmargins of the hole and the cloth fibers around the margins were pushed\r\ninward.[C3-196] Those characteristics established that the hole was\r\ncaused by an entering bullet.[C3-197] Although the precise size of the\r\nbullet could not be determined from the hole, it was consistent with\r\nhaving been made by a 6.5-millimeter bullet.[C3-198]\r\n\r\nThe shirt worn by the President contained a hole on the back side 5¾\r\ninches below the top of the collar and 1⅛ inches to the right of the\r\nmiddle of the back of the shirt.[C3-199] The hole on the rear of the\r\nshirt was approximately circular in shape and about one-fourth of an\r\ninch in diameter, with the fibers pressed inward.[C3-200] These factors\r\nestablished it as a bullet entrance hole.[C3-201] The relative position\r\nof the hole in the back of the suit jacket to the hole in the back\r\nof the shirt indicated that both were caused by the same penetrating\r\nmissile.[C3-202]\r\n\r\nOn the front of the shirt, examination revealed a hole seven-eighths\r\nof an inch below the collar button and a similar opening seven-eighths\r\nof an inch below the buttonhole. These two holes fell into alinement\r\non overlapping positions when the shirt was buttoned.[C3-203] Each\r\nhole was a vertical, ragged slit approximately one-half of an inch\r\nin height, with the cloth fibers protruding outward. Although the\r\ncharacteristics of the slit established that the missile had exited\r\nto the front, the irregular nature of the slit precluded a positive\r\ndetermination that it was a bullet hole.[C3-204] However, the hole\r\ncould have been caused by a round bullet although the characteristics\r\nwere not sufficiently clear to enable the examining expert to render a\r\nconclusive opinion.[C3-205]\r\n\r\nWhen the President’s clothing was removed at Parkland Hospital, his tie\r\nwas cut off by severing the loop immediately to the wearer’s left of\r\nthe knot, leaving the knot in its original condition.[C3-206] The tie\r\nhad a nick on the left side of the knot.[C3-207] The nick was elongated\r\nhorizontally, indicating that the tear was made by some object moving\r\nhorizontally, but the fibers were not affected in a manner which would\r\nshed light on the direction or the nature of the missile.[C3-208]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Governor’s Wounds\r\n\r\nWhile riding in the right jump seat of the Presidential limousine\r\non November 22, Governor Connally sustained wounds of the back,\r\nchest, right wrist and left thigh. Because of the small size and\r\nclean-cut edges of the wound on the Governor’s back, Dr. Robert Shaw\r\nconcluded that it was an entry wound.[C3-209] The bullet traversed\r\nthe Governor’s chest in a downward angle, shattering his fifth rib,\r\nand exited below the right nipple.[C3-210] The ragged edges of the\r\n2-inch (5 centimeters) opening on the front of the chest led Dr. Shaw\r\nto conclude that it was the exit point of the bullet.[C3-211] When\r\nGovernor Connally testified before the Commission 5 months after\r\nthe assassination, on April 21, 1964, the Commission observed the\r\nGovernor’s chest wounds, as well as the injuries to his wrist and thigh\r\nand watched Dr. Shaw measure with a caliper an angle of declination of\r\n25° from the point of entry on the back to the point of exit on the\r\nfront of the Governor’s chest.[C3-212]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the shooting, Governor Connally was unaware that he had\r\nsustained any injuries other than his chest wounds.[C3-213] On the back\r\nof his arm, about 2 inches (5 centimeters) above the wrist joint on\r\nthe thumb side, Dr. Charles F. Gregory observed a linear perforating\r\nwound approximately one-fifth of an inch (one-half centimeter) wide\r\nand 1 inch (2½ centimeters) long.[C3-214] During his operation on this\r\ninjury, the doctor concluded that this ragged wound was the point of\r\nentry because thread and cloth had been carried into the wound to the\r\nregion of the bone.[C3-215] Dr. Gregory’s conclusions were also based\r\nupon the location in the Governor’s wrist, as revealed by X-ray, of\r\nsmall fragments of metal shed by the missile upon striking the firm\r\nsurface of the bone.[C3-216] Evidence of different amounts of air in\r\nthe tissues of the wrist gave further indication that the bullet passed\r\nfrom the back to the front of the wrist.[C3-217] An examination of the\r\npalm surface of the wrist showed a wound approximately one-fifth of\r\nan inch (one-half centimeter) long and approximately three-fourths of\r\nan inch (2 centimeters) above the crease of the right wrist.[C3-218]\r\nDr. Shaw had initially believed that the missile entered on the palm\r\nside of the Governor’s wrist and exited on the back side.[C3-219]\r\nAfter reviewing the factors considered by Dr. Gregory, however, Dr.\r\nShaw withdrew his earlier opinion. He deferred to the judgment of Dr.\r\nGregory, who had more closely examined that wound during the wrist\r\noperation.[C3-220]\r\n\r\nIn addition, Governor Connally suffered a puncture wound in the left\r\nthigh that was approximately two-fifths of an inch (1 centimeter) in\r\ndiameter and located approximately 5 or 6 inches above the Governor’s\r\nleft knee.[C3-221] On the Governor’s leg, very little soft-tissue\r\ndamage was noted, which indicated a tangential wound or the penetration\r\nof a larger missile entering at low velocity and stopping after\r\nentering the skin.[C3-222] X-ray examination disclosed a tiny metallic\r\nfragment embedded in the Governor’s leg.[C3-223] The surgeons who\r\nattended the Governor concluded that the thigh wound was not caused\r\nby the small fragment in the thigh but resulted from the impact of a\r\nlarger missile.[C3-224]\r\n\r\n_Examination of clothing._--The clothing worn by Governor Connally\r\non November 22, 1963, contained holes which matched his wounds. On\r\nthe back of the Governor’s coat, a hole was found 1⅛ inches from\r\nthe seam where the right sleeve attached to the coat and 7¼ inches\r\nto the right of the midline.[C3-225] This hole was elongated in a\r\nhorizontal direction approximately five-eighths of an inch in length\r\nand one-fourth of an inch in height.[C3-226] The front side of the\r\nGovernor’s coat contained a circular hole three-eighths of an inch in\r\ndiameter, located 5 inches to the right of the front right edge of the\r\ncoat slightly above the top button.[C3-227] A rough hole approximately\r\nfive-eighths of an inch in length and three-eighths of an inch in width\r\nwas found near the end of the right sleeve.[C3-228] Each of these holes\r\ncould have been caused by a bullet, but a positive determination of\r\nthis fact or the direction of the missile was not possible because the\r\ngarment had been cleaned and pressed prior to any opportunity for a\r\nscientific examination.[C3-229]\r\n\r\nAn examination of the Governor’s shirt disclosed a very ragged tear\r\nfive-eighths of an inch long horizontally and one-half of an inch\r\nvertically on the back of the shirt near the right sleeve 2 inches\r\nfrom the line where the sleeve attaches.[C3-230] Immediately to the\r\nright was another small tear, approximately three-sixteenths of an inch\r\nlong.[C3-231] The two holes corresponded in position to the hole in\r\nthe back of the Governor’s coat.[C3-232] A very irregular tear in the\r\nform of an “H” was observed on the front side of the Governor’s shirt,\r\napproximately 1½ inches high, with a crossbar tear approximately 1 inch\r\nwide, located 5 inches from the right side seam and 9 inches from the\r\ntop of the right sleeve.[C3-233] Because the shirt had been laundered,\r\nthere were insufficient characteristics for the expert examiner to form\r\na conclusive opinion on the direction or nature of the object causing\r\nthe holes.[C3-234] The rear hole could have been caused by the entrance\r\nof a 6.5-millimeter bullet and the front hole by the exit of such a\r\nbullet.[C3-235]\r\n\r\nOn the French cuff of the right sleeve of the Governor’s shirt was\r\na ragged, irregularly shaped hole located 1½ inches from the end of\r\nthe sleeve and 5½ inches from the outside cuff-link hole.[C3-236] The\r\ncharacteristics after laundering did not permit positive conclusions\r\nbut these holes could have been caused by a bullet passing through the\r\nGovernor’s right wrist from the back to the front sides.[C3-237] The\r\nGovernor’s trousers contained a hole approximately one-fourth of an\r\ninch in diameter in the region of the left knee.[C3-238] The roughly\r\ncircular shape of the hole and the slight tearing away from the edges\r\ngave the hole the general appearance of a bullet hole but it was not\r\npossible to determine the direction of the missile which caused the\r\nhole.[C3-239]\r\n\r\n_Course of bullet._--Ballistics experiments and medical findings\r\nestablished that the missile which passed through the Governor’s wrist\r\nand penetrated his thigh had first traversed his chest. The Army Wound\r\nBallistics experts conducted tests which proved that the Governor’s\r\nwrist wound was not caused by a pristine bullet. (See app. X, pp.\r\n582-585.) A bullet is pristine immediately on exiting from a rifle\r\nmuzzle when it moves in a straight line with a spinning motion and\r\nmaintains its uniform trajectory with but a minimum of nose surface\r\nstriking the air through which it passes.[C3-240] When the straight\r\nline of flight of a bullet is deflected by striking some object, it\r\nstarts to wobble or become irregular in flight, a condition called\r\nyaw.[C3-241] A bullet with yaw has a greater surface exposed to the\r\nstriking material or air, since the target or air is struck not only\r\nby the nose of the bullet, its smallest striking surface, but also by\r\nthe bullet’s sides.[C3-242]\r\n\r\nThe ballistics experts learned the exact nature of the Governor’s wrist\r\nwound by examining Parkland Hospital records and X-rays and conferring\r\nwith Dr. Gregory. The C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found in the\r\nDepository was fired with bullets of the same type as the bullet found\r\non the Governor’s stretcher and the fragments found in the Presidential\r\nlimousine. Shots were fired from a distance of 70 yards at comparable\r\nflesh and bone protected by material similar to the clothing worn by\r\nthe Governor.[C3-243] One of the test shots wounded the comparable\r\nflesh and bone structure in virtually the same place and from the same\r\nangle as the wound inflicted on Governor Connally’s wrist. An X-ray and\r\nphotograph of the simulated wrist confirmed the similarity.[C3-244] The\r\nbullet which inflicted that injury during the tests had a nose which\r\nwas substantially flattened from striking the material.[C3-245] The\r\nstriking velocity at 70 yards of seven shots fired during the tests\r\naveraged 1,858 feet per second; the average exit velocity of five shots\r\nwas 1,776 feet per second.[C3-246]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion that the Governor’s wrist was not struck by a pristine\r\nbullet was based upon the following: (1) greater damage was inflicted\r\non the test material than on the Governor’s wrist;[C3-247] (2) the\r\ntest material had a smaller entry wound and a larger exit wound,\r\ncharacteristic of a pristine bullet, while the Governor’s wrist had\r\na larger entry wound as compared with its exit wound, indicating a\r\nbullet which was tumbling;[C3-248] (3) cloth was carried into the\r\nwrist wound, which is characteristic of an irregular missile;[C3-249]\r\n(4) the partial cutting of a radial nerve and tendon leading to the\r\nGovernor’s thumb further suggested that the bullet which struck him was\r\nnot pristine, since such a bullet would merely push aside a tendon and\r\nnerve rather than catch and tear them;[C3-250] (5) the bullet found\r\non the Governor’s stretcher probably did not pass through the wrist\r\nas a pristine bullet because its nose was not considerably flattened,\r\nas was the case with the pristine bullet which struck the simulated\r\nwrist;[C3-251] and (6) the bullet which caused the Governor’s thigh\r\ninjury and then fell out of the wound had a “very low velocity,”\r\nwhereas the pristine bullets fired during the tests possessed a very\r\nhigh exit velocity.[C3-252]\r\n\r\nAll the evidence indicated that the bullet found on the Governor’s\r\nstretcher could have caused all his wounds. The weight of the whole\r\nbullet prior to firing was approximately 160-161 grains and that of the\r\nrecovered bullet was 158.6 grains.[C3-253] An X-ray of the Governor’s\r\nwrist showed very minute metallic fragments, and two or three of these\r\nfragments were removed from his wrist.[C3-254] All these fragments were\r\nsufficiently small and light so that the nearly whole bullet found on\r\nthe stretcher could have deposited those pieces of metal as it tumbled\r\nthrough his wrist.[C3-255] In their testimony, the three doctors who\r\nattended Governor Connally at Parkland Hospital expressed independently\r\ntheir opinion that a single bullet had passed through his chest;\r\ntumbled through his wrist with very little exit velocity, leaving small\r\nmetallic fragments from the rear portion of the bullet; punctured his\r\nleft thigh after the bullet had lost virtually all of its velocity; and\r\nhad fallen out of the thigh wound.[C3-256]\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally himself thought it likely that all his wounds were\r\ncaused by a single bullet. In his testimony before the Commission, he\r\nrepositioned himself as he recalled his position on the jump seat, with\r\nhis right palm on his left thigh, and said:\r\n\r\n    I * * * wound up the next day realizing I was hit in three\r\n    places, and I was not conscious of having been hit but by one\r\n    bullet, so I tried to reconstruct how I could have been hit\r\n    in three places by the same bullet, and I merely, I know it\r\n    penetrated from the back through the chest first.\r\n\r\n    I assumed that I had turned as I described a moment ago,\r\n    placing my right hand on my left leg, that it hit my wrist,\r\n    went out the center of the wrist, the underside, and then into\r\n    my leg, but it might not have happened that way at all.[C3-257]\r\n\r\nThe Governor’s posture explained how a single missile through his\r\nbody would cause all his wounds. His doctors at Parkland Hospital had\r\nrecreated his position, also, but they placed his right arm somewhat\r\nhigher than his left thigh although in the same alinement.[C3-258] The\r\nwound ballistics experts concurred in the opinion that a single bullet\r\ncaused all the Governor’s wounds.[C3-259]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAJECTORY\r\n\r\nThe cumulative evidence of eyewitnesses, firearms and ballistic\r\nexperts and medical authorities demonstrated that the shots were\r\nfired from above and behind President Kennedy and Governor Connally,\r\nmore particularly, from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building. In order to determine the facts with as much\r\nprecision as possible and to insure that all data were consistent\r\nwith the shots having been fired from the sixth floor window, the\r\nCommission requested additional investigation, including the analysis\r\nof motion picture films of the assassination and onsite tests. The\r\nfacts developed through this investigation by the FBI and Secret\r\nService confirmed the conclusions reached by the Commission regarding\r\nthe source and trajectory of the shots which hit the President and the\r\nGovernor. Moreover, these facts enabled the Commission to make certain\r\napproximations regarding the locations of the Presidential limousine at\r\nthe time of the shots and the relevant time intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFilms and Tests\r\n\r\nWhen the shots rang out the Presidential limousine was moving beyond\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository Building in a southwesterly direction\r\non Elm Street between Houston Street and the Triple Underpass.[C3-260]\r\nThe general location of the car was described and marked on maps by\r\neyewitnesses as precisely as their observations and recollections\r\npermitted.[C3-261] More exact information was provided by motion\r\npictures taken by Abraham Zapruder, Orville O. Nix and Mary Muchmore,\r\nwho were spectators at the scene.[C3-262] Substantial light has been\r\nshed on the assassination sequence by viewing these motion pictures,\r\nparticularly the Zapruder film, which was the most complete and from\r\nwhich individual 35-millimeter slides were made of each motion picture\r\nframe.[C3-263]\r\n\r\nExamination of the Zapruder motion picture camera by the FBI\r\nestablished that 18.3 pictures or frames were taken each second,\r\nand therefore, the timing of certain events could be calculated by\r\nallowing 1/18.3 seconds for the action depicted from one frame to the\r\nnext.[C3-264] The films and slides made from individual frames were\r\nviewed by Governor and Mrs. Connally, the Governor’s doctors, the\r\nautopsy surgeons, and the Army wound ballistics scientists in order\r\nto apply the knowledge of each to determine the precise course of\r\nevents.[C3-265] Tests of the assassin’s rifle disclosed that at least\r\n2.3 seconds were required between shots.[C3-266] In evaluating the\r\nfilms in the light of these timing guides, it was kept in mind that\r\na victim of a bullet wound may not react immediately and, in some\r\nsituations, according to experts, the victim may not even know where he\r\nhas been hit, or when.[C3-267]\r\n\r\nOn May 24, 1964, agents of the FBI and Secret Service conducted a\r\nseries of tests to determine as precisely as possible what happened\r\non November 22, 1963. Since the Presidential limousine was being\r\nremodeled and was therefore unavailable, it was simulated by using\r\nthe Secret Service followup car, which is similar in design.[C3-268]\r\nAny differences were taken into account. Two Bureau agents with\r\napproximately the same physical characteristics sat in the car in the\r\nsame relative positions as President Kennedy and Governor Connally had\r\noccupied. The back of the stand-in for the President was marked with\r\nchalk at the point where the bullet entered. The Governor’s model had\r\non the same coat worn by Governor Connally when he was shot, with the\r\nhole in the back circled in chalk.[C3-269]\r\n\r\nTo simulate the conditions which existed at the assassination scene\r\non November 22, the lower part of the sixth-floor window at the\r\nsoutheast corner of the Depository Building was raised halfway, the\r\ncardboard boxes were repositioned, the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle\r\nfound on the sixth floor of the Depository was used, and mounted on\r\nthat rifle was a camera which recorded the view as was seen by the\r\nassassin.[C3-270] In addition, the Zapruder, Nix, and Muchmore cameras\r\nwere on hand so that photographs taken by these cameras from the same\r\nlocations where they were used on November 22, 1963, could be compared\r\nwith the films of that date.[C3-271] The agents ascertained that the\r\nfoliage of an oak tree that came between the gunman and his target\r\nalong the motorcade route on Elm Street was approximately the same as\r\non the day of the assassination.[C3-272]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Bullet That Hit\r\n\r\nThe position of President Kennedy’s car when he was struck in the\r\nneck was determined with substantial precision from the films and\r\nonsite tests. The pictures or frames in the Zapruder film were marked\r\nby the agents, with the number “1” given to the first frame where\r\nthe motorcycles leading the motorcade came into view on Houston\r\nStreet.[C3-273] The numbers continue in sequence as Zapruder filmed\r\nthe Presidential limousine as it came around the corner and proceeded\r\ndown Elm. The President was in clear view of the assassin as he rode up\r\nHouston Street and for 100 feet as he proceeded down Elm Street, until\r\nhe came to a point denoted as frame 166 on the Zapruder film.[C3-274]\r\nThese facts were determined in the test by placing the car and men\r\non Elm Street in the exact spot where they were when each frame of\r\nthe Zapruder film was photographed. To pinpoint their locations, a\r\nman stood at Zapruder’s position and directed the automobile and both\r\nmodels to the positions shown on each frame, after which a Bureau\r\nphotographer crouched at the sixth-floor window and looked through a\r\ncamera whose lens recorded the view through the telescopic sight of the\r\nC2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.[C3-275] (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n887, p. 99.) Each position was measured to determine how far President\r\nKennedy had gone down Elm from a point, which was designated as station\r\nC, on a line drawn along the west curbline of Houston Street.[C3-276]\r\n\r\nBased on these calculations, the agents concluded that at frame 166 of\r\nthe Zapruder film the President passed beneath the foliage of the large\r\noak tree and the point of impact on the President’s back disappeared\r\nfrom the gunman’s view as seen through the telescopic lens.[C3-277]\r\n(See Commission Exhibit No. 889, p. 100.) For a fleeting instant, the\r\nPresident came back into view in the telescopic lens at frame 186 as\r\nhe appeared in an opening among the leaves.[C3-278] (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 891, p. 101.) The test revealed that the next point at\r\nwhich the rifleman had a clear view through the telescopic sight of\r\nthe point where the bullet entered the President’s back was when the\r\ncar emerged from behind the tree at frame 210.[C3-279] (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 893, p. 102.) According to FBI Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt,\r\n“There is no obstruction from the sixth floor window from the time\r\nthey leave the tree until they disappear down toward the triple\r\noverpass.”[C3-280]\r\n\r\nAs the President rode along Elm Street for a distance of about 140\r\nfeet, he was waving to the crowd.[C3-281] Shaneyfelt testified that\r\nthe waving is seen on the Zapruder movie until around frame 205, when\r\na road sign blocked out most of the President’s body from Zapruder’s\r\nview through the lens of his camera. However, the assassin continued to\r\nhave a clear view of the President as he proceeded down Elm.[C3-282]\r\nWhen President Kennedy again came fully into view in the Zapruder film\r\nat frame 225, he seemed to be reacting to his neck wound by raising\r\nhis hands to his throat.[C3-283] (See Commission Exhibit No. 895, p.\r\n103.) According to Shaneyfelt the reaction was “clearly apparent in 226\r\nand barely apparent in 225.”[C3-284] It is probable that the President\r\nwas not shot before frame 210, since it is unlikely that the assassin\r\nwould deliberately have shot at him with a view obstructed by the oak\r\ntree when he was about to have a clear opportunity. It is also doubtful\r\nthat even the most proficient marksman would have hit him through the\r\noak tree. In addition, the President’s reaction is “barely apparent”\r\nin frame 225, which is 15 frames or approximately eight-tenths second\r\nafter frame 210, and a shot much before 210 would assume a longer\r\nreaction time than was recalled by eyewitnesses at the scene. Thus,\r\nthe evidence indicated that the President was not hit until at least\r\nframe 210 and that he was probably hit by frame 225. The possibility\r\nof variations in reaction time in addition to the obstruction of\r\nZapruder’s view by the sign precluded a more specific determination\r\nthan that the President was probably shot through the neck between\r\nframes 210 and 225, which marked his position between 138.9 and 153.8\r\nfeet west of station C.[C3-285]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 887\r\n\r\nPhotograph taken during reenactment showing C2766 rifle with camera\r\nattached.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 889\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 166]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 891\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 186]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 893\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 210]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 895\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 225]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 697\r\n\r\nPhotograph of Presidential limousine taken during motorcade.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Special Agent Robert A. Frazier, who occupied the position\r\nof the assassin in the sixth-floor window during the reenactment,\r\nit is likely that the bullet which passed through the President’s\r\nneck, as described previously, then struck the automobile or someone\r\nelse in the automobile.[C3-286] The minute examination by the FBI\r\ninspection team, conducted in Washington between 14 and 16 hours\r\nafter the assassination, revealed no damage indicating that a bullet\r\nstruck any part of the interior of the Presidential limousine, with\r\nthe exception of the cracking of the windshield and the dent on the\r\nwindshield chrome.[C3-287] Neither of these points of damage to the car\r\ncould have been caused by the bullet which exited from the President’s\r\nneck at a velocity of 1,772 to 1,779 feet per second.[C3-288] If the\r\ntrajectory had permitted the bullet to strike the windshield, the\r\nbullet would have penetrated it and traveled a substantial distance\r\ndown the road unless it struck some other object en route.[C3-289] Had\r\nthat bullet struck the metal framing, which was dented, it would have\r\ntorn a hole in the chrome and penetrated the framing, both inside and\r\noutside the car.[C3-290] At that exit velocity, the bullet would have\r\npenetrated any other metal or upholstery surface of the interior of the\r\nautomobile.[C3-291]\r\n\r\nThe bullet that hit President Kennedy in the back and exited through\r\nhis throat most likely could not have missed both the automobile\r\nand its occupants. Since it did not hit the automobile, Frazier\r\ntestified that it probably struck Governor Connally.[C3-292] The\r\nrelative positions of President Kennedy and Governor Connally at\r\nthe time when the President was struck in the neck confirm that the\r\nsame bullet probably passed through both men. Pictures taken of the\r\nPresident’s limousine on November 22, 1963, showed that the Governor\r\nsat immediately in front of the President.[C3-293] Even though the\r\nprecise distance cannot be ascertained, it is apparent that President\r\nKennedy was somewhat to the Governor’s right. The President sat on the\r\nextreme right, as noted in the films and by eyewitnesses, while the\r\nright edge of the jump seat in which the Governor sat is 6 inches from\r\nthe right door.[C3-294] (See Commission Exhibit No. 697, p. 104.) The\r\nPresident wore a back brace which tended to make him sit up straight,\r\nand the Governor also sat erect since the jump seat gave him little leg\r\nroom.[C3-295]\r\n\r\nBased on his observations during the reenactment and the position of\r\nGovernor Connally shown in the Zapruder film after the car emerged\r\nfrom behind the sign, Frazier testified that Governor Connally was in\r\na position during the span from frame 207 to frame 225 to receive a\r\nbullet which would have caused the wounds he actually suffered.[C3-296]\r\nGovernor Connally viewed the film and testified that he was hit between\r\nframes 231 and 234.[C3-297] According to Frazier, between frames 235\r\nand 240 the Governor turned sharply to his right, so that by frame\r\n240 he was too far to the right to have received his injuries at that\r\ntime.[C3-298] At some point between frames 235 and 240, therefore,\r\nis the last occasion when Governor Connally could have received his\r\ninjuries, since in the frames following 240 he remained turned too\r\nfar to his right.[C3-299] If Governor Connally was hit by a separate\r\nshot between frames 235 and 240 which followed the shot which hit the\r\nPresident’s neck, it would follow that: (1) the assassin’s first shot,\r\nassuming a minimum firing time of 2.3 seconds (or 42 frames), was fired\r\nbetween frames 193 and 198 when his view was obscured by the oak tree;\r\n(2) President Kennedy continued waving to the crowd after he was hit\r\nand did not begin to react for about 1½ seconds; and (3) the first\r\nshot, although hitting no bones in the President’s body, was deflected\r\nafter its exit from the President’s neck in such a way that it failed\r\nto hit either the automobile or any of the other occupants.\r\n\r\nViewed through the telescopic sight of the C2766 Mannlicher-Carcano\r\nrifle from the sixth-floor window during the test, the marks that\r\nsimulated the entry wounds on the stand-ins for the President and the\r\nGovernor were generally in a straight line. That alinement became\r\nobvious to the viewer through the scope as the Governor’s model\r\nturned slightly to his right and assumed the position which Governor\r\nConnally had described as his position when he was struck. Viewing\r\nthe stand-ins for the President and the Governor in the sight of the\r\nC2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle at the location depicted in frames\r\n207 and 210, Frazier testified: “They both are in direct alinement\r\nwith the telescopic sight at the window. The Governor is immediately\r\nbehind the President in the field of view.”[C3-300] (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 893, p. 102.) A surveyor then placed his sighting equipment\r\nat the precise point of entry on the back of the President’s neck,\r\nassuming that the President was struck at frame 210, and measured the\r\nangle to the end of the muzzle of the rifle positioned where it was\r\nbelieved to have been held by the assassin.[C3-301] That angle measured\r\n21°34’.[C3-302] From the same points of reference, the angle at frame\r\n225 was measured at 20°11’, giving an average angle of 20°52’30” from\r\nframe 210 to frame 225.[C3-303] Allowing for a downward street grade of\r\n3°9’, the probable angle through the President’s body was calculated at\r\n17°43’30”, assuming that he was sitting in a vertical position.[C3-304]\r\n\r\nThat angle was consistent with the trajectory of a bullet passing\r\nthrough the President’s neck and then striking Governor Connally’s\r\nback, causing the wounds which were discussed above. Shortly after\r\nthat angle was ascertained, the open car and the stand-ins were\r\ntaken by the agents to a nearby garage where a photograph was taken\r\nto determine through closer study whether the angle of that shot\r\ncould have accounted for the wounds in the President’s neck and the\r\nGovernor’s back.[C3-305] A rod was placed at an angle of 17°43’30” next\r\nto the stand-ins for the President and the Governor, who were seated in\r\nthe same relative positions.[C3-306] The wounds of entry and exit on\r\nthe President were approximated based on information gained from the\r\nautopsy reports and photographs.[C3-307] The hole in the back of the\r\njacket worn by the Governor and the medical description of the wound\r\non his back marked that entry point.[C3-308] That line of fire from\r\nthe sixth floor of the Depository would have caused the bullet to exit\r\nunder the Governor’s right nipple just as the bullet did. Governor\r\nConnally’s doctors measured an angle of declination on his body from\r\nthe entry wound on his back to the exit on the front of his chest at\r\nabout 25° when he sat erect.[C3-309] That difference was explained\r\nby either a slight deflection of the bullet caused by striking the\r\nfifth rib or the Governor’s leaning slightly backward at the time he\r\nwas struck. In addition, the angle could not be fixed with absolute\r\nprecision, since the large wound on the front of his chest precluded an\r\nexact determination of the point of exit.[C3-310]\r\n\r\nThe alinement of the points of entry was only indicative and not\r\nconclusive that one bullet hit both men. The exact positions of\r\nthe men could not be re-created; thus, the angle could only be\r\napproximated.[C3-311] Had President Kennedy been leaning forward or\r\nbackward, the angle of declination of the shot to a perpendicular\r\ntarget would have varied. The angle of 17°43’30” was approximately\r\nthe angle of declination reproduced in an artist’s drawing.[C3-312]\r\nThat drawing, made from data provided by the autopsy surgeons, could\r\nnot reproduce the exact line of the bullet, since the exit wound\r\nwas obliterated by the tracheotomy. Similarly, if the President or\r\nthe Governor had been sitting in a different lateral position, the\r\nconclusion might have varied. Or if the Governor had not turned in\r\nexactly the way calculated, the alinement would have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nAdditional experiments by the Army Wound Ballistics Branch further\r\nsuggested that the same bullet probably passed through both President\r\nKennedy and Governor Connally. (See app. X, pp. 582-585.) Correlation\r\nof a test simulating the Governor’s chest wound with the neck and\r\nwrist experiments indicated that course. After reviewing the Parkland\r\nHospital medical records and X-rays of the Governor and discussing his\r\nchest injury with the attending surgeon, the Army ballistics experts\r\nvirtually duplicated the wound using the assassination weapon and\r\nanimal flesh covered by cloth.[C3-313] The bullet that struck the\r\nanimal flesh displayed characteristics similar to the bullet found on\r\nGovernor Connally’s stretcher.[C3-314] Moreover, the imprint on the\r\nvelocity screen immediately behind the animal flesh showed that the\r\nbullet was tumbling after exiting from the flesh, having lost a total\r\naverage of 265 feet per second.[C3-315] Taking into consideration the\r\nGovernor’s size, the reduction in velocity of a bullet passing through\r\nhis body would be approximately 400 feet per second.[C3-316]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 902\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM NIX FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 313\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM MUCHMORE FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT]\r\n\r\nBased upon the medical evidence on the wounds of the Governor and\r\nthe President and the wound ballistics tests performed at Edgewood\r\nArsenal, Drs. Olivier and Arthur J. Dziemian, chief of the Army\r\nWound Ballistics Branch, who had spent 17 years in that area of\r\nspecialization, concluded that it was probable that the same bullet\r\npassed through the President’s neck and then inflicted all the wounds\r\non the Governor.[C3-317] Referring to the President’s neck wound\r\nand all the Governor’s wounds, Dr. Dziemian testified: “I think the\r\nprobability is very good that it is, that all the wounds were caused\r\nby one bullet.”[C3-318] Both Drs. Dziemian and Olivier believed that\r\nthe wound on the Governor’s wrist would have been more extensive had\r\nthe bullet which inflicted that injury merely passed through the\r\nGovernor’s chest, exiting at a velocity of approximately 1,500 feet per\r\nsecond.[C3-319] Thus, the Governor’s wrist wound suggested that the\r\nbullet passed through the President’s neck, began to yaw in the air\r\nbetween the President and the Governor, and then lost more velocity\r\nthan 400 feet per second in passing through the Governor’s chest. A\r\nbullet which was yawing on entering into the Governor’s back would\r\nlose substantially more velocity in passing through his body than\r\na pristine bullet.[C3-320] In addition, the bullet that struck the\r\nanimal flesh was flattened to a greater extent than the bullet which\r\npresumably struck the Governor’s rib,[C3-321] which suggests that the\r\nbullet which entered the Governor’s chest had already lost velocity\r\nby passing through the President’s neck. Moreover, the large wound on\r\nthe Governor’s back would be explained by a bullet which was yawing,\r\nalthough that type of wound might also be accounted for by a tangential\r\nstriking.[C3-322]\r\n\r\nDr. Frederick W. Light, Jr., the third of the wound ballistics experts,\r\nwho has been engaged in that specialty at Edgewood Arsenal since 1951,\r\ntestified that the anatomical findings were insufficient for him to\r\nformulate a firm opinion as to whether the same bullet did or did not\r\npass through the President’s neck first before inflicting all the\r\nwounds on Governor Connally.[C3-323] Based on the other circumstances,\r\nsuch as the relative positions of the President and the Governor in\r\nthe automobile, Dr. Light concluded that it was probable that the same\r\nbullet traversed the President’s neck and inflicted all the wounds on\r\nGovernor Connally.[C3-324]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Subsequent Bullet That Hit\r\n\r\nAfter a bullet penetrated President Kennedy’s neck, a subsequent shot\r\nentered the back of his head and exited through the upper right portion\r\nof his skull. The Zapruder, Nix and Muchmore films show the instant in\r\nthe sequence when that bullet struck. (See Commission Exhibit No. 902,\r\np. 108.) That impact was evident from the explosion of the President’s\r\nbrain tissues from the right side of his head. The immediately\r\npreceding frame from the Zapruder film shows the President slumped to\r\nhis left, clutching at his throat, with his chin close to his chest and\r\nhis head tilted forward at an angle.[C3-325] Based upon information\r\nprovided by the doctors who conducted the autopsy, an artist’s drawing\r\ndepicted the path of the bullet through the President’s head, with his\r\nhead being in the same approximate position.[C3-326]\r\n\r\nBy using the Zapruder, Nix and Muchmore motion pictures, the\r\nPresident’s location at the time the bullet penetrated his head was\r\nfixed with reasonable precision. A careful analysis of the Nix and\r\nMuchmore films led to fixing the exact location of these cameramen. The\r\npoint of impact of the bullet on the President’s head was apparent in\r\nall of the movies. At that point in the Nix film a straight line was\r\nplotted from the camera position to a fixed point in the background\r\nand the President’s location along this line was marked on a plat\r\nmap.[C3-327] A similar process was followed with the Muchmore film. The\r\nPresident’s location on the plat map was identical to that determined\r\nfrom the Nix film.[C3-328] The President’s location, established\r\nthrough the Nix and Muchmore films, was confirmed by comparing his\r\nposition on the Zapruder film. This location had hitherto only been\r\napproximated, since there were no landmarks in the background of the\r\nZapruder frame for alinement purposes other than a portion of a painted\r\nline on the curb.[C3-329] Through these procedures, it was determined\r\nthat President Kennedy was shot in the head when he was 230.8 feet from\r\na point on the west curbline on Houston Street where it intersected\r\nwith Elm Street.[C3-330] The President was 265.3 feet from the rifle in\r\nthe sixth-floor window and at that position the approximate angle of\r\ndeclination was 15°21’.[C3-331]\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF SHOTS\r\n\r\nThe consensus among the witnesses at the scene was that three shots\r\nwere fired.[C3-332] However, some heard only two shots,[C3-333] while\r\nothers testified that they heard four and perhaps as many as five\r\nor six shots.[C3-334] The difficulty of accurate perception of the\r\nsound of gunshots required careful scrutiny of all of this testimony\r\nregarding the number of shots. The firing of a bullet causes a number\r\nof noises: the muzzle blast, caused by the smashing of the hot gases\r\nwhich propel the bullet into the relatively stable air at the gun’s\r\nmuzzle; the noise of the bullet, caused by the shock wave built up\r\nahead of the bullet’s nose as it travels through the air; and the noise\r\ncaused by the impact of the bullet on its target.[C3-335] Each noise\r\ncan be quite sharp and may be perceived as a separate shot. The tall\r\nbuildings in the area might have further distorted the sound.\r\n\r\nThe physical and other evidence examined by the Commission compels\r\nthe conclusion that at least two shots were fired. As discussed\r\npreviously, the nearly whole bullet discovered at Parkland Hospital\r\nand the two larger fragments found in the Presidential automobile,\r\nwhich were identified as coming from the assassination rifle, came from\r\nat least two separate bullets and possibly from three.[C3-336] The\r\nmost convincing evidence relating to the number of shots was provided\r\nby the presence on the sixth floor of three spent cartridges which\r\nwere demonstrated to have been fired by the same rifle that fired the\r\nbullets which caused the wounds. It is possible that the assassin\r\ncarried an empty shell in the rifle and fired only two shots, with the\r\nwitnesses hearing multiple noises made by the same shot. Soon after\r\nthe three empty cartridges were found, officials at the scene decided\r\nthat three shots were fired, and that conclusion was widely circulated\r\nby the press. The eyewitness testimony may be subconsciously colored\r\nby the extensive publicity given the conclusion that three shots were\r\nfired. Nevertheless, the preponderance of the evidence, in particular\r\nthe three spent cartridges, led the Commission to conclude that there\r\nwere three shots fired.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHOT THAT MISSED\r\n\r\nFrom the initial findings that (_a_) one shot passed through the\r\nPresident’s neck and then most probably passed through the Governor’s\r\nbody, (_b_) a subsequent shot penetrated the President’s head, (_c_)\r\nno other shot struck any part of the automobile, and (_d_) three shots\r\nwere fired, it follows that one shot probably missed the car and its\r\noccupants. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether it was the first,\r\nsecond, or third shot which missed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Shot\r\n\r\nIf the first shot missed, the assassin perhaps missed in an effort to\r\nfire a hurried shot before the President passed under the oak tree, or\r\npossibly he fired as the President passed under the tree and the tree\r\nobstructed his view. The bullet might have struck a portion of the tree\r\nand been completely deflected. On the other hand, the greatest cause\r\nfor doubt that the first shot missed is the improbability that the\r\nsame marksman who twice hit a moving target would be so inaccurate on\r\nthe first and closest of his shots as to miss completely, not only the\r\ntarget, but the large automobile.\r\n\r\nSome support for the contention that the first shot missed is found in\r\nthe statement of Secret Service Agent Glen A. Bennett, stationed in\r\nthe right rear seat of the President’s followup car, who heard a sound\r\nlike a firecracker as the motorcade proceeded down Elm Street. At that\r\nmoment, Agent Bennett stated:\r\n\r\n    * * * I looked at the back of the President. I heard another\r\n    firecracker noise and saw that shot hit the President about\r\n    four inches down from the right shoulder. A second shot\r\n    followed immediately and hit the right rear high of the\r\n    President’s head.[C3-337]\r\n\r\nSubstantial weight may be given Bennett’s observations. Although his\r\nformal statement was dated November 23, 1963, his notes indicate that\r\nhe recorded what he saw and heard at 5:30 p.m., November 22, 1963, on\r\nthe airplane en route back to Washington, prior to the autopsy, when it\r\nwas not yet known that the President had been hit in the back.[C3-338]\r\nIt is possible, of course, that Bennett did not observe the hole in\r\nthe President’s back, which might have been there immediately after the\r\nfirst noise.\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally’s testimony supports the view that the first shot\r\nmissed, because he stated that he heard a shot, turned slightly to his\r\nright, and, as he started to turn back toward his left, was struck\r\nby the second bullet.[C3-339] He never saw the President during the\r\nshooting sequence, and it is entirely possible that he heard the missed\r\nshot and that both men were struck by the second bullet. Mrs. Connally\r\ntestified that after the first shot she turned and saw the President’s\r\nhands moving toward his throat, as seen in the films at frame\r\n225.[C3-340] However, Mrs. Connally further stated that she thought her\r\nhusband was hit immediately thereafter by the second bullet.[C3-341]\r\nIf the same bullet struck both the President and the Governor, it is\r\nentirely possible that she saw the President’s movements at the same\r\ntime as she heard the second shot. Her testimony, therefore, does not\r\npreclude the possibility of the first shot having missed.\r\n\r\nOther eyewitness testimony, however, supports the conclusion that the\r\nfirst of the shots fired hit the President. As discussed in chapter II,\r\nSpecial Agent Hill’s testimony indicates that the President was hit by\r\nthe first shot and that the head injury was caused by a second shot\r\nwhich followed about 5 seconds later. James W. Altgens, a photographer\r\nin Dallas for the Associated Press, had stationed himself on Elm Street\r\nopposite the Depository to take pictures of the passing motorcade.\r\nAltgens took a widely circulated photograph which showed President\r\nKennedy reacting to the first of the two shots which hit him. (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 900, p. 113.) According to Altgens, he snapped\r\nthe picture “almost simultaneously” with a shot which he is confident\r\nwas the first one fired.[C3-342] Comparison of his photograph with\r\nthe Zapruder film, however, revealed that Altgens took his picture\r\nat approximately the same moment as frame 255 of the movie, 30 to\r\n45 frames (approximately 2 seconds) later than the point at which\r\nthe President was shot in the neck.[C3-343] (See Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 901, p. 114.) Another photographer, Phillip L. Willis, snapped\r\na picture at a time which he also asserts was simultaneous with the\r\nfirst shot. Analysis of his photograph revealed that it was taken at\r\napproximately frame 210 of the Zapruder film, which was the approximate\r\ntime of the shot that probably hit the President and the Governor. If\r\nWillis accurately recalled that there were no previous shots, this\r\nwould be strong evidence that the first shot did not miss.[C3-344]\r\n\r\nIf the first shot did not miss, there must be an explanation for\r\nGovernor Connally’s recollection that he was not hit by it. There was,\r\nconceivably, a delayed reaction between the time the bullet struck him\r\nand the time he realized that he was hit, despite the fact that the\r\nbullet struck a glancing blow to a rib and penetrated his wrist bone.\r\nThe Governor did not even know that he had been struck in the wrist or\r\nin the thigh until he regained consciousness in the hospital the next\r\nday. Moreover, he testified that he did not hear what he thought was\r\nthe second shot, although he did hear a subsequent shot which coincided\r\nwith the shattering of the President’s head.[C3-345] One possibility,\r\ntherefore, would be a sequence in which the Governor heard the first\r\nshot, did not immediately feel the penetration of the bullet, then\r\nfelt the delayed reaction of the impact on his back, later heard the\r\nshot which shattered the President’s head, and then lost consciousness\r\nwithout hearing a third shot which might have occurred later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 900\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH BY AP PHOTOGRAPHER\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 901\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM ZAPRUDER FILM\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH FROM RE-ENACTMENT\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\r\n\r\nFRAME 255]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Shot\r\n\r\nThe possibility that the second shot missed is consistent with the\r\nelapsed time between the two shots that hit their mark. From the timing\r\nevidenced by the Zapruder films, there was an interval of from 4.8 to\r\n5.6 seconds between the shot which struck President Kennedy’s neck\r\n(between frames 210 to 225) and the shot which struck his head at frame\r\n313.[C3-346] Since a minimum of 2.3 seconds must elapse between shots,\r\na bullet could have been fired from the rifle and missed during this\r\ninterval.[C3-347] This possibility was buttressed by the testimony of\r\nwitnesses who claimed that the shots were evenly spaced, since a second\r\nshot occurring within an interval of approximately 5 seconds would have\r\nto be almost exactly midway in this period. If Altgens’ recollection\r\nis correct that he snapped his picture at the same moment as he heard\r\na shot, then it is possible that he heard a second shot which missed,\r\nsince a shot fired 2.3 seconds before he took his picture at frame 255\r\ncould have hit the President at about frame 213.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a substantial majority of the witnesses stated that\r\nthe shots were not evenly spaced. Most witnesses recalled that the\r\nsecond and third shots were bunched together, although some believed\r\nthat it was the first and second which were bunched.[C3-348] To the\r\nextent that reliance can be placed on recollection of witnesses as to\r\nthe spacing of the shots, the testimony that the shots were not evenly\r\nspaced would militate against a second shot missing. Another factor\r\narguing against the second shot missing is that the gunman would have\r\nbeen shooting at very near the minimum allowable time to have fired\r\nthe three shots within 4.8 to 5.6 seconds, although it was entirely\r\npossible for him to have done so. (See ch. IV, pp. 188-194.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Third Shot\r\n\r\nThe last possibility, of course, is that it was the third shot which\r\nmissed. This conclusion conforms most easily with the probability\r\nthat the assassin would most likely have missed the farthest shot,\r\nparticularly since there was an acceleration of the automobile after\r\nthe shot which struck the President’s head. The limousine also changed\r\ndirection by following the curve to the right, whereas previously it\r\nhad been proceeding in almost a straight line with a rifle protruding\r\nfrom the sixth-floor window of the Depository Building.\r\n\r\nOne must consider, however, the testimony of the witnesses who\r\ndescribed the head shot as the concluding event in the assassination\r\nsequence. Illustrative is the testimony of Associated Press\r\nphotographer Altgens, who had an excellent vantage point near the\r\nPresident’s car. He recalled that the shot which hit the President’s\r\nhead “was the last shot--that much I will say with a great degree\r\nof certainty.”[C3-349] On the other hand, Emmett J. Hudson, the\r\ngroundskeeper of Dealey Plaza, testified that from his position on\r\nElm Street, midway between Houston Street and the Triple Underpass,\r\nhe heard a third shot after the shot which hit the President in the\r\nhead.[C3-350] In addition, Mrs. Kennedy’s testimony indicated that\r\nneither the first nor the second shot missed. Immediately after the\r\nfirst noise she turned, because of the Governor’s yell, and saw her\r\nhusband raise his hand to his forehead. Then the second shot struck the\r\nPresident’s head.[C3-351]\r\n\r\nSome evidence suggested that a third shot may have entirely missed and\r\nhit the turf or street by the Triple Underpass. Royce G. Skelton, who\r\nwatched the motorcade from the railroad bridge, testified that after\r\ntwo shots “the car came on down close to the Triple Underpass” and an\r\nadditional shot “hit in the left front of the President’s car on the\r\ncement.”[C3-352] Skelton thought that there had been a total of four\r\nshots, either the third or fourth of which hit in the vicinity of the\r\nunderpass.[C3-353] Dallas Patrolman J. W. Foster, who was also on the\r\nTriple Underpass, testified that a shot hit the turf near a manhole\r\ncover in the vicinity of the underpass.[C3-354] Examination of this\r\narea, however, disclosed no indication that a bullet struck at the\r\nlocations indicated by Skelton or Foster.[C3-355]\r\n\r\nAt a different location in Dealey Plaza, the evidence indicated that a\r\nbullet fragment did hit the street. James T. Tague, who got out of his\r\ncar to watch the motorcade from a position between Commerce and Main\r\nStreets near the Triple Underpass, was hit on the cheek by an object\r\nduring the shooting.[C3-356] Within a few minutes Tague reported this\r\nto Deputy Sheriff Eddy R. Walthers, who was examining the area to\r\nsee if any bullets had struck the turf.[C3-357] Walthers immediately\r\nstarted to search where Tague had been standing and located a place on\r\nthe south curb of Main Street where it appeared a bullet had hit the\r\ncement.[C3-358] According to Tague, “There was a mark quite obviously\r\nthat was a bullet, and it was very fresh.”[C3-359] In Tague’s opinion,\r\nit was the second shot which caused the mark, since he thinks he heard\r\nthe third shot after he was hit in the face.[C3-360] This incident\r\nappears to have been recorded in the contemporaneous report of Dallas\r\nPatrolman L. L. Hill, who radioed in around 12:40 p.m.: “I have one\r\nguy that was possibly hit by a richochet from the bullet off the\r\nconcrete.”[C3-361] Scientific examination of the mark on the south\r\ncurb of Main Street by FBI experts disclosed metal smears which, “were\r\nspectrographically determined to be essentially lead with a trace\r\nof antimony.”[C3-362] The mark on the curb could have originated\r\nfrom the lead core of a bullet but the absence of copper precluded\r\n“the possibility that the mark on the curbing section was made by an\r\nunmutilated military full metal-jacketed bullet such as the bullet from\r\nGovernor Connally’s stretcher.”[C3-363]\r\n\r\nIt is true that the noise of a subsequent shot might have been drowned\r\nout by the siren on the Secret Service followup car immediately\r\nafter the head shot, or the dramatic effect of the head shot might\r\nhave caused so much confusion that the memory of subsequent events\r\nwas blurred. Nevertheless, the preponderance of the eyewitness\r\ntestimony that the head shot was the final shot must be weighed in any\r\ndetermination as to whether it was the third shot that missed. Even\r\nif it were caused by a bullet fragment, the mark on the south curb of\r\nMain Street cannot be identified conclusively with any of the three\r\nshots fired. Under the circumstances it might have come from the bullet\r\nwhich hit the President’s head, or it might have been a product of the\r\nfragmentation of the missed shot upon hitting some other object in the\r\narea.[C3-364] Since he did not observe any of the shots striking the\r\nPresident, Tague’s testimony that the second shot, rather than the\r\nthird, caused the scratch on his cheek, does not assist in limiting the\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nThe wide range of possibilities and the existence of conflicting\r\ntestimony, when coupled with the impossibility of scientific\r\nverification, precludes a conclusive finding by the Commission as to\r\nwhich shot missed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME SPAN OF SHOTS\r\n\r\nWitnesses at the assassination scene said that the shots were\r\nfired within a few seconds, with the general estimate being 5 to 6\r\nseconds.[C3-365] That approximation was most probably based on the\r\nearlier publicized reports that the first shot struck the President in\r\nthe neck, the second wounded the Governor and the third shattered the\r\nPresident’s head, with the time span from the neck to the head shots on\r\nthe President being approximately 5 seconds. As previously indicated,\r\nthe time span between the shot entering the back of the President’s\r\nneck and the bullet which shattered his skull was 4.8 to 5.6 seconds.\r\nIf the second shot missed, then 4.8 to 5.6 seconds was the total time\r\nspan of the shots. If either the first or third shots missed, then a\r\nminimum of 2.3 seconds (necessary to operate the rifle) must be added\r\nto the time span of the shots which hit, giving a minimum time of 7.1\r\nto 7.9 seconds for the three shots. If more than 2.3 seconds elapsed\r\nbetween a shot that missed and one that hit, then the time span would\r\nbe correspondingly increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the evidence analyzed in this chapter, the Commission has\r\nconcluded that the shots which killed President Kennedy and wounded\r\nGovernor Connally were fired from the sixth-floor window at the\r\nsoutheast corner of the Texas School Book Depository Building. Two\r\nbullets probably caused all the wounds suffered by President Kennedy\r\nand Governor Connally. Since the preponderance of the evidence\r\nindicated that three shots were fired, the Commission concluded that\r\none shot probably missed the Presidential limousine and its occupants,\r\nand that the three shots were fired in a time period ranging from\r\napproximately 4.8 to in excess of 7 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe Assassin\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding chapter has established that the bullets which killed\r\nPresident Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally were fired from the\r\nsoutheast corner window of the sixth floor of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building and that the weapon which fired these bullets was\r\na Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5-millimeter Italian rifle bearing the serial\r\nnumber C2766. In this chapter the Commission evaluates the evidence\r\nupon which it has based its conclusion concerning the identity of the\r\nassassin. This evidence includes (1) the ownership and possession of\r\nthe weapon used to commit the assassination, (2) the means by which the\r\nweapon was brought into the Depository Building, (3) the identity of\r\nthe person present at the window from which the shots were fired, (4)\r\nthe killing of Dallas Patrolman J.D. Tippit within 45 minutes after the\r\nassassination, (5) the resistance to arrest and the attempted shooting\r\nof another police officer by the man (Lee Harvey Oswald) subsequently\r\naccused of assassinating President Kennedy and killing Patrolman\r\nTippit, (6) the lies told to the police by Oswald, (7) the evidence\r\nlinking Oswald to the attempted killing of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker\r\n(Resigned, U.S. Army) on April 10, 1963, and (8) Oswald’s capability\r\nwith a rifle.\r\n\r\n\r\nOWNERSHIP AND POSSESSION OF ASSASSINATION WEAPON\r\n\r\nPurchase of Rifle by Oswald\r\n\r\nShortly after the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle was found on the sixth floor\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository Building,[C4-1] agents of the FBI\r\nlearned from retail outlets in Dallas that Crescent Firearms, Inc.,\r\nof New York City, was a distributor of surplus Italian 6.5-millimeter\r\nmilitary rifles.[C4-2] During the evening of November 22, 1963, a\r\nreview of the records of Crescent Firearms revealed that the firm had\r\nshipped an Italian carbine, serial number C2766, to Klein’s Sporting\r\nGoods Co., of Chicago, Ill.[C4-3] After searching their records from\r\n10 p.m. to 4 a.m. the officers of Klein’s discovered that a rifle\r\nbearing serial number C2766 had been shipped to one A. Hidell, Post\r\nOffice Box 2915, Dallas, Tex., on March 20, 1963.[C4-4] (See Waldman\r\nExhibit No. 7, p. 120.)\r\n\r\nAccording to its microfilm records, Klein’s received an order for a\r\nrifle on March 13, 1963, on a coupon clipped from the February 1963\r\nissue of the American Rifleman magazine. The order coupon was signed,\r\nin handprinting, “A. Hidell, P.O. Box 2915, Dallas, Texas.” (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 773, p. 120.) It was sent in an envelope bearing\r\nthe same name and return address in handwriting. Document examiners\r\nfor the Treasury Department and the FBI testified unequivocally that\r\nthe bold printing on the face of the mail-order coupon was in the\r\nhandprinting of Lee Harvey Oswald and that the writing on the envelope\r\nwas also his.[C4-5] Oswald’s writing on these and other documents was\r\nidentified by comparing the writing and printing on the documents in\r\nquestion with that appearing on documents known to have been written by\r\nOswald, such as his letters, passport application, and endorsements of\r\nchecks.[C4-6] (See app. X, p. 568-569.)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the order coupon the envelope contained a U.S. postal\r\nmoney order for $21.45, purchased as No. 2,202,130,462 in Dallas,\r\nTex., on March 12, 1963.[C4-7] The canceled money order was obtained\r\nfrom the Post Office Department. Opposite the printed words “Pay To”\r\nwere written the words “Kleins Sporting Goods,” and opposite the\r\nprinted word “From” were written the words “A. Hidell, P.O. Box 2915\r\nDallas, Texas.” These words were also in the handwriting of Lee Harvey\r\nOswald.[C4-8] (See Commission Exhibit No. 788, p. 120.)\r\n\r\nFrom Klein’s records it was possible to trace the processing of the\r\norder after its receipt. A bank deposit made on March 13, 1963,\r\nincluded an item of $21.45. Klein’s shipping order form shows an\r\nimprint made by the cash register which recorded the receipt of $21.45\r\non March 13, 1963. This price included $19.95 for the rifle and the\r\nscope, and $1.50 for postage and handling. The rifle without the scope\r\ncost only $12.78.[C4-9]\r\n\r\nAccording to the vice president of Klein’s, William Waldman, the scope\r\nwas mounted on the rifle by a gunsmith employed by Klein’s, and the\r\nrifle was shipped fully assembled in accordance with customary company\r\nprocedures.[C4-10] The specific rifle shipped against the order had\r\nbeen received by Klein’s from Crescent on February 21, 1963. It bore\r\nthe manufacturer’s serial number C2766. On that date, Klein’s placed\r\nan internal control number VC836 on this rifle.[C4-11] According to\r\nKlein’s shipping order form, one Italian carbine 6.5 X-4× scope,\r\ncontrol number VC836, serial number C2766, was shipped parcel post to\r\n“A. Hidell, P.O. Box 2915, Dallas, Texas,” on March 20, 1963.[C4-12]\r\nInformation received from the Italian Armed Forces Intelligence Service\r\nhas established that this particular rifle was the only rifle of its\r\ntype bearing serial number C2766.[C4-13] (See app. X, p. 554.)\r\n\r\nThe post office box to which the rifle was shipped was rented to “Lee\r\nH. Oswald” from October 9, 1962, to May 14, 1963.[C4-14] Experts on\r\nhandwriting identification from the Treasury Department and the FBI\r\ntestified that the signature and other writing on the application for\r\nthat box were in the handwriting of Lee Harvey Oswald,[C4-15] as was\r\na change-of-address card dated May 12, 1963,[C4-16] by which Oswald\r\nrequested that mail addressed to that box be forwarded to him in New\r\nOrleans, where he had moved on April 24.[C4-17] Since the rifle was\r\nshipped from Chicago on March 20, 1963, it was received in Dallas\r\nduring the period when Oswald rented and used the box. (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 791, p. 120.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOCUMENTS ESTABLISHING PURCHASE OF RIFLE BY LEE HARVEY\r\nOSWALD\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT 791\r\n\r\nAPPLICATION FOR POST OFFICE BOX\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT 773\r\n\r\nPURCHASE ORDER\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT 788\r\n\r\nMONEY ORDER\r\n\r\nWALDMAN’S EXHIBIT 7\r\n\r\nKLEIN’S SHIPPING ORDER]\r\n\r\nIt is not known whether the application for post office box 2915\r\nlisted “A. Hidell” as a person entitled to receive mail at this box.\r\nIn accordance with postal regulations, the portion of the application\r\nwhich lists names of persons, other than the applicant, entitled to\r\nreceive mail was thrown away after the box was closed on May 14,\r\n1963.[C4-18] Postal Inspector Harry D. Holmes of the Dallas Post Office\r\ntestified, however, that when a package is received for a certain\r\nbox, a notice is placed in that box regardless of whether the name\r\non the package is listed on the application as a person entitled to\r\nreceive mail through that box. The person having access to the box then\r\ntakes the notice to the window and is given the package. Ordinarily,\r\nInspector Holmes testified, identification is not requested because\r\nit is assumed that the person with the notice is entitled to the\r\npackage.[C4-19]\r\n\r\nOswald’s use of the name “Hidell” to purchase the assassination weapon\r\nwas one of several instances in which he used this name as an alias.\r\nWhen arrested on the day of the assassination, he had in his possession\r\na Smith & Wesson .38 caliber revolver[C4-20] purchased by mail-order\r\ncoupon from Seaport-Traders, Inc., a mail-order division of George\r\nRose & Co., Los Angeles. The mail-order coupon listed the purchaser\r\nas “A. J. Hidell Age 28” with the address of post office box 2915\r\nin Dallas.[C4-21] Handwriting experts from the FBI and the Treasury\r\nDepartment testified that the writing on the mail-order form was that\r\nof Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-22]\r\n\r\nAmong other identification cards in Oswald’s wallet at the time of his\r\narrest were a Selective Service notice of classification, a Selective\r\nService registration certificate,[C4-23] and a certificate of service\r\nin the U.S. Marine Corps,[C4-24] all three cards being in his own\r\nname. Also in his wallet at that time were a Selective Service notice\r\nof classification and a Marine certificate of service in the name\r\nof Alek James Hidell.[C4-25] On the Hidell Selective Service card\r\nthere appeared a signature, “Alek J. Hidell,” and the photograph of\r\nLee Harvey Oswald.[C4-26] Experts on questioned documents from the\r\nTreasury Department and the FBI testified that the Hidell cards were\r\ncounterfeit photographic reproductions made by photographing the\r\nOswald cards, retouching the resulting negatives, and producing prints\r\nfrom the retouched negatives. The Hidell signature on the notice of\r\nclassification was in the handwriting of Oswald.[C4-27] (See app. X, p.\r\n572.)\r\n\r\nIn Oswald’s personal effects found in his room at 1026 North\r\nBeckley Avenue in Dallas was a purported international certificate\r\nof vaccination signed by “Dr. A. J. Hideel,” Post Office Box 30016,\r\nNew Orleans.[C4-28] It certified that Lee Harvey Oswald had been\r\nvaccinated for smallpox on June 8, 1963. This, too, was a forgery.\r\nThe signature of “A. J. Hideel” was in the handwriting of Lee Harvey\r\nOswald.[C4-29] There is no “Dr. Hideel” licensed to practice medicine\r\nin Louisiana.[C4-30] There is no post office box 30016 in the New\r\nOrleans Post Office but Oswald had rented post office box 30061 in New\r\nOrleans[C4-31] on June 3, 1963, listing Marina Oswald and A. J. Hidell\r\nas additional persons entitled to receive mail in the box.[C4-32]\r\nThe New Orleans postal authorities had not discarded the portion of\r\nthe application listing the names of those, other than the owner of\r\nthe box, entitled to receive mail through the box. Expert testimony\r\nconfirmed that the writing on this application was that of Lee Harvey\r\nOswald.[C4-33]\r\n\r\nHidell’s name on the post office box application was part of Oswald’s\r\nuse of a nonexistent Hidell to serve as president of the so-called New\r\nOrleans Chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. (As discussed\r\nbelow in ch. VI, p. 292.) Marina Oswald testified that she first\r\nlearned of Oswald’s use of the fictitious name “Hidell” in connection\r\nwith his pro-Castro activities in New Orleans.[C4-34] According\r\nto her testimony, he compelled her to write the name “Hidell” on\r\nmembership cards in the space designated for the signature of the\r\n“Chapter President.”[C4-35] The name “Hidell” was stamped on some of\r\nthe “Chapter’s” printed literature and on the membership application\r\nblanks.[C4-36] Marina Oswald testified, “I knew there was no such\r\norganization. And I know Hidell is merely an altered Fidel, and I\r\nlaughed at such foolishness.”[C4-37] Hidell was a fictitious president\r\nof an organization of which Oswald was the only member.[C4-38]\r\n\r\nWhen seeking employment in New Orleans, Oswald listed a “Sgt. Robt.\r\nHidell” as a reference on one job application[C4-39] and “George\r\nHidell” as a reference on another.[C4-40] Both names were found to be\r\nfictitious.[C4-41] Moreover, the use of “Alek” as a first name for\r\nHidell is a further link to Oswald because “Alek” was Oswald’s nickname\r\nin Russia.[C4-42] Letters received by Marina Oswald from her husband\r\nsigned “Alek” were given to the Commission.[C4-43]\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald’s Palmprint on Rifle Barrel\r\n\r\nBased on the above evidence, the Commission concluded that Oswald\r\npurchased the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository\r\nBuilding. Additional evidence of ownership was provided in the form of\r\npalmprint identification which indicated that Oswald had possession of\r\nthe rifle he had purchased.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after the rifle was discovered on the sixth floor of\r\nthe Depository Building[C4-44] it was examined by Lt. J. C. Day of\r\nthe identification bureau of the Dallas police. He lifted the rifle\r\nby the wooden stock after his examination convinced him that the wood\r\nwas too rough to take fingerprints. Capt. J. W. Fritz then ejected a\r\ncartridge by operating the bolt, but only after Day viewed the knob\r\non the bolt through a magnifying glass and found no prints.[C4-45]\r\nDay continued to examine the rifle with the magnifying glass, looking\r\nfor possible fingerprints. He applied fingerprint powder to the side\r\nof the metal housing near the trigger, and noticed traces of two\r\nprints.[C4-46] At 11:45 p.m. on November 22, the rifle was released\r\nto the FBI and forwarded to Washington where it was examined on the\r\nmorning of November 23 by Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the Latent\r\nFingerprint Section of the FBI’s Identification Division.[C4-47]\r\n\r\nIn his testimony before the Commission, Latona stated that when he\r\nreceived the rifle, the area where prints were visible was protected by\r\ncellophane.[C4-48] He examined these prints, as well as photographs of\r\nthem which the Dallas police had made, and concluded that:\r\n\r\n    * * * the formations, the ridge formations and characteristics,\r\n    were insufficient for purposes of either effecting\r\n    identification or a determination that the print was not\r\n    identical with the prints of people. Accordingly, my opinion\r\n    simply was that the latent prints which were there were of no\r\n    value.[C4-49]\r\n\r\nLatona then processed the complete weapon but developed no identifiable\r\nprints.[C4-50] He stated that the poor quality of the wood and the\r\nmetal would cause the rifle to absorb moisture from the skin, thereby\r\nmaking a clear print unlikely.[C4-51]\r\n\r\nOn November 22, however, before surrendering possession of the rifle\r\nto the FBI Laboratory, Lieutenant Day of the Dallas Police Department\r\nhad “lifted” a palmprint from the underside of the gun barrel “near\r\nthe firing end of the barrel about 3 inches under the Woodstock when I\r\ntook the Woodstock loose.”[C4-52] “Lifting” a print involves the use of\r\nadhesive material to remove the fingerprint powder which adheres to the\r\noriginal print. In this way the powdered impression is actually removed\r\nfrom the object.[C4-53] The lifting had been so complete in this case\r\nthat there was no trace of the print on the rifle itself when it was\r\nexamined by Latona. Nor was there any indication that the lift had been\r\nperformed.[C4-54] Day, on the other hand, believed that sufficient\r\ntraces of the print had been left on the rifle barrel, because he\r\ndid not release the lifted print until November 26, when he received\r\ninstructions to send “everything that we had” to the FBI.[C4-55] The\r\nprint arrived in the FBI Laboratory in Washington on November 29,\r\nmounted on a card on which Lieutenant Day had written the words “off\r\nunderside gun barrel near end of foregrip C2766.”[C4-56] The print’s\r\npositive identity as having been lifted from the rifle was confirmed\r\nby FBI Laboratory tests which established that the adhesive material\r\nbearing the print also bore impressions of the same irregularities that\r\nappeared on the barrel of the rifle.[C4-57]\r\n\r\nLatona testified that this palmprint was the right palmprint of\r\nLee Harvey Oswald.[C4-58] At the request of the Commission, Arthur\r\nMandella, fingerprint expert with the New York City Police Department,\r\nconducted an independent examination and also determined that this\r\nwas the right palmprint of Oswald.[C4-59] Latona’s findings were also\r\nconfirmed by Ronald G. Wittmus, another FBI fingerprint expert.[C4-60]\r\nIn the opinion of these experts, it was not possible to estimate the\r\ntime which elapsed between the placing of the print on the rifle and\r\nthe date of the lift.[C4-61]\r\n\r\nExperts testifying before the Commission agreed that palmprints\r\nare as unique as fingerprints for purposes of establishing\r\nidentification.[C4-62] Oswald’s palmprint on the underside of the\r\nbarrel demonstrates that he handled the rifle when it was disassembled.\r\nA palmprint could not be placed on this portion of the rifle, when\r\nassembled, because the wooden foregrip covers the barrel at this\r\npoint.[C4-63] The print is additional proof that the rifle was in\r\nOswald’s possession.\r\n\r\n\r\nFibers on Rifle\r\n\r\nIn a crevice between the butt plate of the rifle and the wooden stock\r\nwas a tuft of several cotton fibers of dark blue, gray-black, and\r\norange-yellow shades.[C4-64] On November 23, 1963, these fibers were\r\nexamined by Paul M. Stombaugh, a special agent assigned to the Hair\r\nand Fiber Unit of the FBI Laboratory.[C4-65] He compared them with the\r\nfibers found in the shirt which Oswald was wearing when arrested in\r\nthe Texas Theatre.[C4-66] This shirt was also composed of dark blue,\r\ngray-black and orange-yellow cotton fibers. Stombaugh testified that\r\nthe colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the\r\nrifle matched those in Oswald’s shirt.[C4-67] (See app. X, p. 592.)\r\n\r\nStombaugh explained in his testimony that in fiber analysis, as\r\ndistinct from fingerprint or firearms identification, it is not\r\npossible to state with scientific certainty that a particular small\r\ngroup of fibers come from a certain piece of clothing to the exclusion\r\nof all others because there are not enough microscopic characteristics\r\npresent in fibers.[C4-68] Judgments as to probability will depend on\r\nthe number and types of matches.[C4-69] He concluded, “There is no\r\ndoubt in my mind that these fibers could have come from this shirt.\r\nThere is no way, however, to eliminate the possibility of the fibers\r\nhaving come from another identical shirt.”[C4-70]\r\n\r\nHaving considered the probabilities as explained in Stombaugh’s\r\ntestimony, the Commission has concluded that the fibers in the tuft\r\non the rifle most probably came from the shirt worn by Oswald when he\r\nwas arrested, and that this was the same shirt which Oswald wore on\r\nthe morning of the assassination. Marina Oswald testified that she\r\nthought her husband wore this shirt to work on that day.[C4-71] The\r\ntestimony of those who saw him after the assassination was inconclusive\r\nabout the color of Oswald’s shirt,[C4-72] but Mary Bledsoe, a former\r\nlandlady of Oswald, saw him on a bus approximately 10 minutes after\r\nthe assassination and identified the shirt as being the one worn by\r\nOswald primarily because of a distinctive hole in the shirt’s right\r\nelbow.[C4-73] Moreover, the bus transfer which he obtained as he left\r\nthe bus was still in the pocket when he was arrested.[C4-74] Although\r\nOswald returned to his roominghouse after the assassination and when\r\nquestioned by the police, claimed to have changed his shirt,[C4-75] the\r\nevidence indicates that he continued wearing the same shirt which he\r\nwas wearing all morning and which he was still wearing when arrested.\r\n\r\nIn light of these findings the Commission evaluated the additional\r\ntestimony of Stombaugh that the fibers were caught in the crevice of\r\nthe rifle’s butt plate “in the recent past.”[C4-76] Although Stombaugh\r\nwas unable to estimate the period of time the fibers were on the rifle\r\nhe said that the fibers “were clean, they had good color to them,\r\nthere was no grease on them and they were not fragmented. They looked\r\nas if they had just been picked up.”[C4-77] The relative freshness\r\nof the fibers is strong evidence that they were caught on the rifle\r\non the morning of the assassination or during the preceding evening.\r\nFor 10 days prior to the eve of the assassination Oswald had not been\r\npresent at Ruth Paine’s house in Irving, Tex.,[C4-78] where the rifle\r\nwas kept.[C4-79] Moreover, the Commission found no reliable evidence\r\nthat Oswald used the rifle at any time between September 23, when it\r\nwas transported from New Orleans, and November 22, the day of the\r\nassassination.[C4-80] The fact that on the morning of the assassination\r\nOswald was wearing the shirt from which these relatively fresh fibers\r\nmost probably originated, provides some evidence that they were placed\r\non the rifle that day since there was limited, if any, opportunity for\r\nOswald to handle the weapon during the 2 months prior to November 22.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Stombaugh pointed out that fibers might retain their\r\nfreshness if the rifle had been “put aside” after catching the fibers.\r\nThe rifle used in the assassination probably had been wrapped in a\r\nblanket for about 8 weeks prior to November 22.[C4-81] Because the\r\nrelative freshness of these fibers might be explained by the continuous\r\nstorage of the rifle in the blanket, the Commission was unable to reach\r\nany firm conclusion as to when the fibers were caught in the rifle. The\r\nCommission was able to conclude, however, that the fibers most probably\r\ncame from Oswald’s shirt. This adds to the conviction of the Commission\r\nthat Oswald owned and handled the weapon used in the assassination.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotograph of Oswald With Rifle\r\n\r\nDuring the period from March 2, 1963, to April 24, 1963, the Oswalds\r\nlived on Neely Street in Dallas in a rented house which had a small\r\nback yard.[C4-82] One Sunday, while his wife was hanging diapers,\r\nOswald asked her to take a picture of him holding a rifle, a pistol\r\nand issues of two newspapers later identified as the Worker and the\r\nMilitant.[C4-83] Two pictures were taken. The Commission has concluded\r\nthat the rifle shown in these pictures is the same rifle which was\r\nfound on the sixth floor of the Depository Building on November 22,\r\n1963. (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 133-A and 133-B, p. 126.)\r\n\r\nOne of these pictures, Exhibit No. 133-A, shows most of the rifle’s\r\nconfiguration.[C4-84] Special Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, a photography\r\nexpert with the FBI, photographed the rifle used in the assassination,\r\nattempting to duplicate the position of the rifle and the lighting in\r\nExhibit No. 133-A.[C4-85] After comparing the rifle in the simulated\r\nphotograph with the rifle in Exhibit No. 133-A, Shaneyfelt testified,\r\n“I found it to be the same general configuration. All appearances were\r\nthe same.” He found “one notch in the stock at this point that appears\r\nvery faintly in the photograph.” He stated, however, that while he\r\n“found no differences” between the rifles in the two photographs, he\r\ncould not make a “positive identification to the exclusion of all other\r\nrifles of the same general configuration.”[C4-86]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPHS OF OSWALD HOLDING RIFLE\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 133-A\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 133-B\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 134\r\n\r\n(Enlargement of Commission Exhibit No. 133-A)]\r\n\r\nThe authenticity of these pictures has been established by expert\r\ntestimony which links the second picture, Commission Exhibit No. 133-B,\r\nto Oswald’s Imperial Reflex camera, with which Marina Oswald testified\r\nshe took the pictures.[C4-87] The negative of that picture, Commission\r\nExhibit No. 133-B, was found among Oswald’s possessions.[C4-88]\r\nUsing a recognized technique of determining whether a picture was\r\ntaken with a particular camera, Shaneyfelt compared this negative\r\nwith a negative which he made by taking a new picture with Oswald’s\r\ncamera.[C4-89] He concluded that the negative of Exhibit No. 133-B was\r\nexposed in Oswald’s Imperial Reflex camera to the exclusion of all\r\nother cameras.[C4-90] He could not test Exhibit No. 133-A in the same\r\nway because the negative was never recovered.[C4-91] Both pictures,\r\nhowever, have identical backgrounds and lighting and, judging from the\r\nshadows, were taken at the same angle. They are photographs of the\r\nsame scene.[C4-92] Since Exhibit No. 133-B was taken with Oswald’s\r\ncamera, it is reasonably certain that Exhibit No. 133-A was taken by\r\nthe same camera at the same time, as Marina Oswald testified. Moreover,\r\nShaneyfelt testified that in his opinion the photographs were not\r\ncomposites of two different photographs and that Oswald’s face had not\r\nbeen superimposed on another body.[C4-93]\r\n\r\nOne of the photographs taken by Marina Oswald was widely published\r\nin newspapers and magazines, and in many instances the details of\r\nthese pictures differed from the original, and even from each other,\r\nparticularly as to the configuration of the rifle. The Commission\r\nsought to determine whether these photographs were retouched prior\r\nto publication. Shaneyfelt testified that the published photographs\r\nappeared to be based on a copy of the original which the publications\r\nhad each retouched differently.[C4-94] Several of the publications\r\nfurnished the Commission with the prints they had used, or described by\r\ncorrespondence the retouching they had done. This information enabled\r\nthe Commission to conclude that the published pictures were the same\r\nas the original except for retouching done by these publications,\r\napparently for the purpose of clarifying the lines of the rifle and\r\nother details in the picture.[C4-95]\r\n\r\nThe dates surrounding the taking of this picture and the purchase of\r\nthe rifle reinforce the belief that the rifle in the photograph is\r\nthe rifle which Oswald bought from Klein’s. The rifle was shipped\r\nfrom Klein’s in Chicago on March 20, 1963, at a time when the Oswalds\r\nwere living on Neely Street.[C4-96] From an examination of one of\r\nthe photographs, the Commission determined the dates of the issues\r\nof the Militant and the Worker which Oswald was holding in his hand.\r\nBy checking the actual mailing dates of these issues and the time it\r\nusually takes to effect delivery to Dallas, it was established that the\r\nphotographs must have been taken sometime after March 27.[C4-97] Marina\r\nOswald testified that the photographs were taken on a Sunday about 2\r\nweeks before the attempted shooting of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker on\r\nApril 10, 1963.[C4-98] By Sunday, March 31, 1963, 10 days prior to the\r\nWalker attempt, Oswald had undoubtedly received the rifle shipped from\r\nChicago on March 20, the revolver shipped from Los Angeles on the same\r\ndate,[C4-99] and the two newspapers which he was holding in the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nRifle Among Oswald’s Possessions\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald testified that the rifle found on the sixth floor of the\r\nDepository Building was the “fateful rifle of Lee Oswald.”[C4-100]\r\nMoreover, it was the only rifle owned by her husband following his\r\nreturn from the Soviet Union in June 1962.[C4-101] It had been\r\npurchased in March 1963, and taken to New Orleans where Marina Oswald\r\nsaw it in their rented apartment during the summer of 1963.[C4-102]\r\nIt appears from his wife’s testimony that Oswald may have sat on the\r\nscreened-in porch at night practicing with the rifle by looking through\r\nthe telescopic sight and operating the bolt.[C4-103] In September 1963,\r\nOswald loaded their possessions into a station wagon owned by Ruth\r\nPaine, who had invited Marina Oswald and the baby to live at her home\r\nin Irving,[C4-104] Tex. Marina Oswald has stated that the rifle was\r\namong these possessions,[C4-105] although Ruth Paine testified that she\r\nwas not aware of it.[C4-106]\r\n\r\nFrom September 24, 1963, when Marina Oswald arrived in Irving from\r\nNew Orleans, until the morning of the assassination, the rifle was,\r\naccording to the evidence, stored in a green and brown blanket in the\r\nPaines’ garage among the Oswalds’ other possessions.[C4-107] About 1\r\nweek after the return from New Orleans, Marina Oswald was looking in\r\nthe garage for parts to the baby’s crib and thought that the parts\r\nmight be in the blanket. When she started to open the blanket, she saw\r\nthe stock of the rifle.[C4-108] Ruth and Michael Paine both noticed the\r\nrolled-up blanket in the garage during the time that Marina Oswald was\r\nliving in their home.[C4-109] On several occasions, Michael Paine moved\r\nthe blanket in the garage.[C4-110] He thought it contained tent poles,\r\nor possibly other camping equipment such as a folding shovel.[C4-111]\r\nWhen he appeared before the Commission, Michael Paine lifted the\r\nblanket with the rifle wrapped inside and testified that it appeared\r\nto be the same approximate weight and shape as the package in his\r\ngarage.[C4-112]\r\n\r\nAbout 3 hours after the assassination, a detective and deputy sheriff\r\nsaw the blanket-roll, tied with a string, lying on the floor of the\r\nPaines’ garage. Each man testified that he thought he could detect\r\nthe outline of a rifle in the blanket, even though the blanket was\r\nempty.[C4-113] Paul M. Stombaugh, of the FBI Laboratory, examined the\r\nblanket and discovered a bulge approximately 10 inches long midway\r\nin the blanket. This bulge was apparently caused by a hard protruding\r\nobject which had stretched the blanket’s fibers. It could have been\r\ncaused by the telescopic sight of the rifle which was approximately 11\r\ninches long.[C4-114] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1304, p. 132.)\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nHaving reviewed the evidence that (1) Lee Harvey Oswald purchased the\r\nrifle used in the assassination, (2) Oswald’s palmprint was on the\r\nrifle in a position which shows that he had handled it while it was\r\ndisassembled, (3) fibers found on the rifle most probably came from\r\nthe shirt Oswald was wearing on the day of the assassination, (4) a\r\nphotograph taken in the yard of Oswald’s apartment showed him holding\r\nthis rifle, and (5) the rifle was kept among Oswald’s possessions\r\nfrom the time of its purchase until the day of the assassination, the\r\nCommission concluded that the rifle used to assassinate President\r\nKennedy and wound Governor Connally was owned and possessed by Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIFLE IN THE BUILDING\r\n\r\nThe Commission has evaluated the evidence tending to show how Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald’s Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, serial number C2766, was\r\nbrought into the Depository Building, where it was found on the\r\nsixth floor shortly after the assassination. In this connection the\r\nCommission considered (1) the circumstances surrounding Oswald’s return\r\nto Irving, Tex., on Thursday, November 21, 1963, (2) the disappearance\r\nof the rifle from its normal place of storage, (3) Oswald’s arrival at\r\nthe Depository Building on November 22, carrying a long and bulky brown\r\npaper package, (4) the presence of a long handmade brown paper bag\r\nnear the point from which the shots were fired, and (5) the palmprint,\r\nfiber, and paper analyses linking Oswald and the assassination weapon\r\nto this bag.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Curtain Rod Story\r\n\r\nDuring October and November of 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald lived in a\r\nroominghouse in Dallas while his wife and children lived in Irving,\r\nat the home of Ruth Paine,[C4-115] approximately 15 miles from\r\nOswald’s place of work at the Texas School Book Depository. Oswald\r\ntraveled between Dallas and Irving on weekends in a car driven by a\r\nneighbor of the Paines, Buell Wesley Frazier, who also worked at the\r\nDepository.[C4-116] Oswald generally would go to Irving on Friday\r\nafternoon and return to Dallas Monday morning. According to the\r\ntestimony of Frazier, Marina Oswald, and Ruth Paine, it appears that\r\nOswald never returned to Irving in midweek prior to November 21, 1963,\r\nexcept on Monday, October 21, when he visited his wife in the hospital\r\nafter the birth of their second child.[C4-117]\r\n\r\nDuring the morning of November 21, Oswald asked Frazier whether he\r\ncould ride home with him that afternoon. Frazier, surprised, asked\r\nhim why he was going to Irving on Thursday night rather than Friday.\r\nOswald replied, “I’m going home to get some curtain rods * * * [to]\r\nput in an apartment.”[C4-118] The two men left work at 4:40 p.m. and\r\ndrove to Irving. There was little conversation between them on the way\r\nhome.[C4-119] Mrs. Linnie Mae Randle, Frazier’s sister, commented to\r\nher brother about Oswald’s unusual midweek return to Irving. Frazier\r\ntold her that Oswald had come home to get curtain rods.[C4-120]\r\n\r\nIt would appear, however, that obtaining curtain rods was not the\r\npurpose of Oswald’s trip to Irving on November 21. Mrs. A. C. Johnson,\r\nhis landlady, testified that Oswald’s room at 1026 North Beckley Avenue\r\nhad curtains and curtain rods,[C4-121] and that Oswald had never\r\ndiscussed the subject with her.[C4-122] In the Paines’ garage, along\r\nwith many other objects of a household character, there were two flat\r\nlightweight curtain rods belonging to Ruth Paine but they were still\r\nthere on Friday afternoon after Oswald’s arrest.[C4-123] Oswald never\r\nasked Mrs. Paine about the use of curtain rods,[C4-124] and Marina\r\nOswald testified that Oswald did not say anything about curtain rods\r\non the day before the assassination.[C4-125] No curtain rods were\r\nknown to have been discovered in the Depository Building after the\r\nassassination.[C4-126] In deciding whether Oswald carried a rifle to\r\nwork in a long paper bag on November 22, the Commission gave weight to\r\nthe fact that Oswald gave a false reason for returning home on November\r\n21, and one which provided an excuse for the carrying of a bulky\r\npackage the following morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Missing Rifle\r\n\r\nBefore dinner on November 21, Oswald played on the lawn of the Paines’\r\nhome with his daughter June.[C4-127] After dinner Ruth Paine and\r\nMarina Oswald were busy cleaning house and preparing their children\r\nfor bed.[C4-128] Between the hours of 8 and 9 p.m. they were occupied\r\nwith the children in the bedrooms located at the extreme east end of\r\nthe house.[C4-129] On the west end of the house is the attached garage,\r\nwhich can be reached from the kitchen or from the outside.[C4-130] In\r\nthe garage were the personal belongings of the Oswald family including,\r\nas the evidence has shown, the rifle wrapped in the old brown and green\r\nblanket.[C4-131]\r\n\r\nAt approximately 9 p.m., after the children had been put to bed, Mrs.\r\nPaine, according to her testimony before the Commission, “went out to\r\nthe garage to paint some children’s blocks, and worked in the garage\r\nfor half an hour or so. I noticed when I went out that the light was\r\non.”[C4-132] Mrs. Paine was certain that she had not left the light on\r\nin the garage after dinner.[C4-133] According to Mrs. Paine, Oswald\r\nhad gone to bed by 9 p.m.;[C4-134] Marina Oswald testified that it was\r\nbetween 9 and 10 p.m.[C4-135] Neither Marina Oswald nor Ruth Paine\r\nsaw Oswald in the garage.[C4-136] The period between 8 and 9 p.m.,\r\nhowever, provided ample opportunity for Oswald to prepare the rifle for\r\nhis departure the next morning. Only if disassembled could the rifle\r\nfit into the paper bag found near the window[C4-137] from which the\r\nshots were fired. A firearms expert with the FBI assembled the rifle\r\nin 6 minutes using a 10-cent coin as a tool, and he could disassemble\r\nit more rapidly.[C4-138] While the rifle may have already been\r\ndisassembled when Oswald arrived home on Thursday, he had ample time\r\nthat evening to disassemble the rifle and insert it into the paper bag.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the assassination, Marina Oswald was watching television\r\nwhen she learned of the shooting. A short time later Mrs. Paine told\r\nher that someone had shot the President “from the building in which\r\nLee is working.” Marina Oswald testified that at that time “My heart\r\ndropped. I then went to the garage to see whether the rifle was there\r\nand I saw that the blanket was still there and I said ‘Thank God.’” She\r\ndid not unroll the blanket. She saw that it was in its usual position\r\nand it appeared to her to have something inside.[C4-139]\r\n\r\nSoon afterward, at about 3 p.m., police officers arrived and searched\r\nthe house. Mrs. Paine pointed out that most of the Oswalds’ possessions\r\nwere in the garage.[C4-140] With Ruth Paine acting as an interpreter,\r\nDetective Rose asked Marina whether her husband had a rifle. Mrs.\r\nPaine, who had no knowledge of the rifle, first said “No,” but when\r\nthe question was translated, Marina Oswald replied “Yes.”[C4-141] She\r\npointed to the blanket which was on the floor very close to where Ruth\r\nPaine was standing. Mrs. Paine testified:\r\n\r\n    As she [Marina] told me about it I stepped onto the blanket\r\n    roll. * * * And she indicated to me that she had peered into\r\n    this roll and saw a portion of what she took to be a gun she\r\n    knew her husband to have, a rifle. And I then translated this\r\n    to the officers that she knew that her husband had a gun that\r\n    he had stored in here. * * * I then stepped off of it and the\r\n    officer picked it up in the middle and it bent so. * * *[C4-142]\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine had the actual blanket before her as she testified and she\r\nindicated that the blanket hung limp in the officer’s hand.[C4-143]\r\nMarina Oswald testified that this was her first knowledge that the\r\nrifle was not in its accustomed place.[C4-144]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Long and Bulky Package\r\n\r\nOn the morning of November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald left the Paine\r\nhouse in Irving at approximately 7:15 a.m., while Marina Oswald was\r\nstill in bed.[C4-145] Neither she nor Mrs. Paine saw him leave the\r\nhouse.[C4-146] About half-a-block away from the Paine house was the\r\nresidence of Mrs. Linnie Mae Randle, the sister of the man with whom\r\nOswald drove to work--Buell Wesley Frazier. Mrs. Randle stated that on\r\nthe morning of November 22, while her brother was eating breakfast, she\r\nlooked out the breakfast-room window and saw Oswald cross the street\r\nand walk toward the driveway where her brother parked his car near\r\nthe carport. He carried a “heavy brown bag.”[C4-147] Oswald gripped\r\nthe bag in his right hand near the top. “It tapered like this as he\r\nhugged it in his hand. It was * * * more bulky toward the bottom”\r\nthan toward the top.[C4-148] She then opened the kitchen door and\r\nsaw Oswald open the right rear door of her brother’s car and place\r\nthe package in the back of the car.[C4-149] Mrs. Randle estimated\r\nthat the package was approximately 28 inches long and about 8 inches\r\nwide.[C4-150] She thought that its color was similar to that of the\r\nbag found on the sixth floor of the School Book Depository after the\r\nassassination.[C4-151]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1304\r\n\r\nC2766 Mannlicher-Carcano rifle and paper bag found on the sixth floor\r\nof the Texas School Book Depository.]\r\n\r\nFrazier met Oswald at the kitchen door and together they walked to the\r\ncar.[C4-152] After entering the car, Frazier glanced over his shoulder\r\nand noticed a brown paper package on the back seat. He asked, “What’s\r\nthe package, Lee?” Oswald replied, “curtain rods.”[C4-153] Frazier told\r\nthe Commission “* * * the main reason he was going over there that\r\nThursday afternoon when he was to bring back some curtain rods, so I\r\ndidn’t think any more about it when he told me that.”[C4-154] Frazier\r\nestimated that the bag was 2 feet long “give and take a few inches,”\r\nand about 5 or 6 inches wide.[C4-155] As they sat in the car, Frazier\r\nasked Oswald where his lunch was, and Oswald replied that he was going\r\nto buy his lunch that day.[C4-156] Frazier testified that Oswald\r\ncarried no lunch bag that day. “When he rode with me, I say he always\r\nbrought lunch except that one day on November 22 he didn’t bring his\r\nlunch that day.”[C4-157]\r\n\r\nFrazier parked the car in the company parking lot about 2 blocks\r\nnorth of the Depository Building. Oswald left the car first, picked\r\nup the brown paper bag, and proceeded toward the building ahead of\r\nFrazier. Frazier walked behind and as they crossed the railroad tracks\r\nhe watched the switching of the cars. Frazier recalled that one end\r\nof the package was under Oswald’s armpit and the lower part was held\r\nwith his right hand so that it was carried straight and parallel\r\nto his body. When Oswald entered the rear door of the Depository\r\nBuilding, he was about 50 feet ahead of Frazier. It was the first time\r\nthat Oswald had not walked with Frazier from the parking lot to the\r\nbuilding entrance.[C4-158] When Frazier entered the building, he did\r\nnot see Oswald.[C4-159] One employee, Jack Dougherty, believed that he\r\nsaw Oswald coming to work, but he does not remember that Oswald had\r\nanything in his hands as he entered the door.[C4-160] No other employee\r\nhas been found who saw Oswald enter that morning.[C4-161]\r\n\r\nIn deciding whether Oswald carried the assassination weapon in the\r\nbag which Frazier and Mrs. Randle saw, the Commission has carefully\r\nconsidered the testimony of these two witnesses with regard to the\r\nlength of the bag. Frazier and Mrs. Randle testified that the bag which\r\nOswald was carrying was approximately 27 or 28 inches long,[C4-162]\r\nwhereas the wooden stock of the rifle, which is its largest component,\r\nmeasured 34.8 inches.[C4-163] The bag found on the sixth floor was 38\r\ninches long.[C4-164] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1304, p. 132.) When\r\nFrazier appeared before the Commission and was asked to demonstrate\r\nhow Oswald carried the package, he said, “Like I said, I remember\r\nthat I didn’t look at the package very much * * * but when I did\r\nlook at it he did have his hands on the package like that,”[C4-165]\r\nand at this point Frazier placed the upper part of the package under\r\nhis armpit and attempted to cup his right hand beneath the bottom of\r\nthe bag. The disassembled rifle was too long to be carried in this\r\nmanner. Similarly, when the butt of the rifle was placed in Frazier’s\r\nhand, it extended above his shoulder to ear level.[C4-166] Moreover,\r\nin an interview on December 1, 1963, with agents of the FBI, Frazier\r\nhad marked the point on the back seat of his car which he believed\r\nwas where the bag reached when it was laid on the seat with one edge\r\nagainst the door. The distance between the point on the seat and the\r\ndoor was 27 inches.[C4-167]\r\n\r\nMrs. Randle said, when shown the paper bag, that the bag she saw Oswald\r\ncarrying “wasn’t that long, I mean it was folded down at the top as\r\nI told you. It definitely wasn’t that long.”[C4-168] And she folded\r\nthe bag to a length of about 28½ inches. Frazier doubted whether the\r\nbag that Oswald carried was as wide as the bag found on the sixth\r\nfloor,[C4-169] although Mrs. Randle testified that the width was\r\napproximately the same.[C4-170]\r\n\r\nThe Commission has weighed the visual recollection of Frazier and\r\nMrs. Randle against the evidence here presented that the bag Oswald\r\ncarried contained the assassination weapon and has concluded that\r\nFrazier and Randle are mistaken as to the length of the bag. Mrs.\r\nRandle saw the bag fleetingly and her first remembrance is that it was\r\nheld in Oswald’s right hand “and it almost touched the ground as he\r\ncarried it.”[C4-171] Frazier’s view of the bag was from the rear. He\r\ncontinually advised that he was not paying close attention.[C4-172] For\r\nexample, he said,\r\n\r\n    * * * I didn’t pay too much attention the way he was walking\r\n    because I was walking along there looking at the railroad cars\r\n    and watching the men on the diesel switch them cars and I\r\n    didn’t pay too much attention on how he carried the package at\r\n    all.[C4-173]\r\n\r\nFrazier could easily have been mistaken when he stated that Oswald held\r\nthe bottom of the bag cupped in his hand with the upper end tucked into\r\nhis armpit.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation of Bag\r\n\r\nA handmade bag of wrapping paper and tape[C4-174] was found in the\r\nsoutheast corner of the sixth floor alongside the window from which the\r\nshots were fired.[C4-175] (See Commission Exhibit No. 2707, p. 142.) It\r\nwas not a standard type bag which could be obtained in a store and it\r\nwas presumably made for a particular purpose. It was the appropriate\r\nsize to contain, in disassembled form, Oswald’s Mannlicher-Carcano\r\nrifle, serial No. C2766, which was also found on the sixth\r\nfloor.[C4-176] Three cartons had been placed at the window apparently\r\nto act as a gun rest and a fourth carton was placed behind those at the\r\nwindow.[C4-177] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1301, p. 138.) A person\r\nseated on the fourth carton could assemble the rifle without being seen\r\nfrom the rest of the sixth floor because the cartons stacked around the\r\nsoutheast corner would shield him.[C4-178] (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n723, p. 80.) The presence of the bag in this corner is cogent evidence\r\nthat it was used as the container for the rifle. At the time the bag\r\nwas found, Lieutenant Day of the Dallas police wrote on it, “Found next\r\nto the sixth floor window gun fired from. May have been used to carry\r\ngun. Lt. J. C. Day.”[C4-179]\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Evidence Linking Rifle and Oswald to Paper Bag\r\n\r\n_Oswald’s fingerprint and palmprint found on bag._--Using a standard\r\nchemical method involving silver nitrates[C4-180] the FBI Laboratory\r\ndeveloped a latent palmprint and latent fingerprint on the bag.\r\n(See app. X, p. 565.) Sebastian F. Latona, supervisor of the FBI’s\r\nLatent Fingerprint Section, identified these prints as the left index\r\nfingerprint and right palmprint of Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-181] The\r\nportion of the palm which was identified was the heel of the right\r\npalm, i.e., the area near the wrist, on the little finger side.[C4-182]\r\nThese prints were examined independently by Ronald G. Wittmus of the\r\nFBI,[C4-183] and by Arthur Mandella, a fingerprint expert with the New\r\nYork City Police Department.[C4-184] Both concluded that the prints\r\nwere the right palm and left index finger of Lee Oswald. No other\r\nidentifiable prints were found on the bag.[C4-185]\r\n\r\nOswald’s palmprint on the bottom of the paper bag indicated, of course,\r\nthat he had handled the bag. Furthermore, it was consistent with the\r\nbag having contained a heavy or bulky object when he handled it since a\r\nlight object is usually held by the fingers.[C4-186] The palmprint was\r\nfound on the closed end of the bag. It was from Oswald’s right hand, in\r\nwhich he carried the long package as he walked from Frazier’s car to\r\nthe building.[C4-187]\r\n\r\n_Materials used to make bag._--On the day of the assassination, the\r\nDallas police obtained a sample of wrapping paper and tape from the\r\nshipping room of the Depository and forwarded it to the FBI Laboratory\r\nin Washington.[C4-188] James C. Cadigan, a questioned-documents expert\r\nwith the Bureau, compared the samples with the paper and tape in the\r\nactual bag. He testified, “In all of the observations and physical\r\ntests that I made I found * * * the bag * * * and the paper sample * *\r\n* were the same.”[C4-189]\r\n\r\nAmong other tests, the paper and tape were submitted to fiber analysis\r\nand spectrographic examination.[C4-190] In addition the tape was\r\ncompared to determine whether the sample tape and the tape on the bag\r\nhad been taken from the tape dispensing machine at the Depository.\r\nWhen asked to explain the similarity of characteristics, Cadigan\r\nstated:[C4-191]\r\n\r\n    Well, briefly, it would be the thickness of both the paper and\r\n    the tape, the color under various lighting conditions of both\r\n    the paper and the tape, the width of the tape, the knurled\r\n    markings on the surface of the fiber, the texture of the fiber,\r\n    the felting pattern * * *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I found that the paper sack found on the sixth floor * * * and\r\n    the sample * * * had the same observable characteristics both\r\n    under the microscope and all the visual tests that I could\r\n    conduct.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The papers I also found were similar in fiber composition,\r\n    therefore, in addition to the visual characteristics,\r\n    microscopic and UV [ultra violet] characteristics.\r\n\r\nMr. Cadigan concluded that the paper and tape from the bag were\r\nidentical in all respects to the sample paper and tape taken from the\r\nTexas School Book Depository shipping room on November 22, 1963.[C4-192]\r\n\r\nOn December 1, 1963, a replica bag was made from materials found on\r\nthat date in the shipping room. This was done as an investigatory aid\r\nsince the original bag had been discolored during various laboratory\r\nexaminations and could not be used for valid identification by\r\nwitnesses.[C4-193] Cadigan found that the paper used to make this\r\nreplica sack had different characteristics from the paper in the\r\noriginal bag.[C4-194] The science of paper analysis enabled him to\r\ndistinguish between different rolls of paper even though they were\r\nproduced by the same manufacturer.[C4-195]\r\n\r\nSince the Depository normally used approximately one roll of paper\r\nevery 3 working days,[C4-196] it was not surprising that the replica\r\nsack made on December 1, 1963, had different characteristics from\r\nboth the actual bag and the sample taken on November 22. On the other\r\nhand, since two rolls could be made from the same batch of paper, one\r\ncannot estimate when, prior to November 22, Oswald made the paper bag.\r\nHowever, the complete identity of characteristics between the paper\r\nand tape in the bag found on the sixth floor and the paper and tape\r\nfound in the shipping room of the Depository on November 22 enabled\r\nthe Commission to conclude that the bag was made from these materials.\r\nThe Depository shipping department was on the first floor to which\r\nOswald had access in the normal performance of his duties filling\r\norders.[C4-197]\r\n\r\n_Fibers in paper bag matched fibers in blanket._--When Paul M.\r\nStombaugh of the FBI Laboratory examined the paper bag, he found,\r\non the inside, a single brown delustered viscose fiber and several\r\nlight green cotton fibers.[C4-198] The blanket in which the rifle was\r\nstored was composed of brown and green cotton, viscose and woolen\r\nfibers.[C4-199]\r\n\r\nThe single brown viscose fiber found in the bag matched some\r\nof the brown viscose fibers from the blanket in all observable\r\ncharacteristics.[C4-200] The green cotton fibers found in the paper\r\nbag matched some of the green cotton fibers in the blanket “in all\r\nobservable microscopic characteristics.”[C4-201] Despite these matches,\r\nhowever, Stombaugh was unable to render an opinion that the fibers\r\nwhich he found in the bag had probably come from the blanket, because\r\nother types of fibers present in the blanket were not found in the bag.\r\nHe concluded:\r\n\r\n    All I would say here is that it is possible that these fibers\r\n    could have come from this blanket, because this blanket is\r\n    composed of brown and green woolen fibers, brown and green\r\n    delustered viscose fibers, and brown and green cotton fibers. *\r\n    * * We found no brown cotton fibers, no green viscose fibers,\r\n    and no woolen fibers.\r\n\r\n    So if I found all of these then I would have been able to say\r\n    these fibers probably had come from this blanket. But since I\r\n    found so few, then I would say the possibility exists, these\r\n    fibers could have come from this blanket.[C4-202]\r\n\r\nStombaugh confirmed that the rifle could have picked up fibers from the\r\nblanket and transferred them to the paper bag.[C4-203] In light of the\r\nother evidence linking Lee Harvey Oswald, the blanket, and the rifle\r\nto the paper bag found on the sixth floor, the Commission considered\r\nStombaugh’s testimony of probative value in deciding whether Oswald\r\ncarried the rifle into the building in the paper bag.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald (1) told the curtain rod story to Frazier to explain both\r\nthe return to Irving on a Thursday and the obvious bulk of the package\r\nwhich he intended to bring to work the next day; (2) took paper and\r\ntape from the wrapping bench of the Depository and fashioned a bag\r\nlarge enough to carry the disassembled rifle; (3) removed the rifle\r\nfrom the blanket in the Paines’ garage on Thursday evening; (4) carried\r\nthe rifle into the Depository Building, concealed in the bag; and, (5)\r\nleft the bag alongside the window from which the shots were fired.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSWALD AT WINDOW\r\n\r\nLee Harvey Oswald was hired on October 15, 1963, by the Texas School\r\nBook Depository as an “order filler.”[C4-204] He worked principally\r\non the first and sixth floors of the building, gathering books listed\r\non orders and delivering them to the shipping room on the first\r\nfloor.[C4-205] He had ready access to the sixth floor,[C4-206] from\r\nthe southeast corner window of which the shots were fired.[C4-207]\r\nThe Commission evaluated the physical evidence found near the window\r\nafter the assassination and the testimony of eyewitnesses in deciding\r\nwhether Lee Harvey Oswald was present at this window at the time of the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1301\r\n\r\nSOUTHEAST CORNER OF SIXTH FLOOR SHOWING ARRANGEMENT OF CARTONS SHORTLY\r\nAFTER SHOTS WERE FIRED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1302\r\n\r\nAPPROXIMATE LOCATION OF WRAPPING-PAPER BAG AND LOCATION OF PALM PRINT\r\nON CARTON NEAR WINDOW IN SOUTHEAST CORNER. (HAND POSITION SHOWN BY\r\nDOTTED LINE ON BOX)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPalmprints and Fingerprints on Cartons and Paper Bag\r\n\r\nBelow the southeast corner window on the sixth floor was a large carton\r\nof books measuring approximately 18 by 12 by 14 inches which had been\r\nmoved from a stack along the south wall.[C4-208] Atop this carton was\r\na small carton marked “Rolling Readers,” measuring approximately 13\r\nby 9 by 8 inches.[C4-209] In front of this small carton and resting\r\npartially on the windowsill was another small “Rolling Readers”\r\ncarton.[C4-210] These two small cartons had been moved from a stack\r\nabout three aisles away.[C4-211] The boxes in the window appeared to\r\nhave been arranged as a convenient gun rest.[C4-212] (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1301, p. 138.) Behind these boxes was another carton placed\r\non the floor on which a man sitting could look southwesterly down Elm\r\nStreet over the top of the “Rolling Readers” cartons.[C4-213] Next to\r\nthese cartons was the handmade paper bag, previously discussed, on\r\nwhich appeared the print of the left index finger and right palm of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald.[C4-214] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1302, p. 139.)\r\n\r\nThe cartons were forwarded to the FBI in Washington. Sebastian F.\r\nLatona, supervisor of the Latent Fingerprint Section, testified that\r\n20 identifiable fingerprints and 8 palmprints were developed on these\r\ncartons.[C4-215] The carton on the windowsill and the large carton\r\nbelow the window contained no prints which could be identified as being\r\nthose of Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-216] The other “Rolling Readers” carton,\r\nhowever, contained a palmprint and a fingerprint which were identified\r\nby Latona as being the left palmprint and right index fingerprint of\r\nLee Harvey Oswald.[C4-217] (See app. X, p. 566.)\r\n\r\nThe Commission has considered the possibility that the cartons might\r\nhave been moved in connection with the work that was being performed\r\non the sixth floor on November 22. Depository employees were laying\r\na new floor at the west end and transferring books from the west to\r\nthe east end of the building.[C4-218] The “Rolling Readers” cartons,\r\nhowever, had not been moved by the floor layers and had apparently been\r\ntaken to the window from their regular position for some particular\r\npurpose.[C4-219] The “Rolling Readers” boxes contained, instead of\r\nbooks, light blocks used as reading aids.[C4-220] They could be easily\r\nadjusted and were still solid enough to serve as a gun rest.\r\n\r\nThe box on the floor, behind the three near the window, had been\r\none of these moved by the floor layers from the west wall to near\r\nthe east side of the building in preparation for the laying of the\r\nfloor.[C4-221] During the afternoon of November 22, Lieutenant Day\r\nof the Dallas police dusted this carton with powder and developed\r\na palmprint on the top edge of the carton on the side nearest the\r\nwindow.[C4-222] The position of this palmprint on the carton was\r\nparallel with the long axis of the box, and at right angles with the\r\nshort axis; the bottom of the palm rested on the box.[C4-223] Someone\r\nsitting on the box facing the window would have his palm in this\r\nposition if he placed his hand alongside his right hip. (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 1302, p. 139.) This print which had been cut out of the\r\nbox was also forwarded to the FBI and Latona identified it as Oswald’s\r\nright palmprint.[C4-224] In Latona’s opinion “not too long” a time\r\nhad elapsed between the time that the print was placed on the carton\r\nand the time that it had been developed by the Dallas police.[C4-225]\r\nAlthough Bureau experiments had shown that 24 hours was a likely\r\nmaximum time, Latona stated that he could only testify with certainty\r\nthat the print was less than 3 days old.[C4-226]\r\n\r\nThe print, therefore, could have been placed on the carton at any time\r\nwithin this period. The freshness of this print could be estimated\r\nonly because the Dallas police developed it through the use of powder.\r\nSince cartons absorb perspiration, powder can successfully develop a\r\nprint on such material[C4-227] only within a limited time. When the FBI\r\nin Washington received the cartons, the remaining prints, including\r\nOswald’s on the Rolling Readers carton, were developed by chemical\r\nprocesses. The freshness of prints developed in this manner[C4-228]\r\ncannot be estimated, so no conclusions can be drawn as to whether these\r\nremaining prints preceded or followed the print developed in Dallas\r\nby powder. Most of the prints were found to have been placed on the\r\ncartons by an FBI clerk and a Dallas police officer after the cartons\r\nhad been processed with powder by the Dallas Police.[C4-229] (See ch.\r\nVI, p. 249; app. X, p. 566.)\r\n\r\nIn his independent investigation, Arthur Mandella of the New York\r\nCity Police Department reached the same conclusion as Latona that the\r\nprints found on the cartons were those of Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-229]\r\nIn addition, Mandella was of the opinion that the print taken from the\r\ncarton on the floor was probably made within a day or a day and a half\r\nof the examination on November 22.[C4-230] Moreover, another expert\r\nwith the FBI, Ronald G. Wittmus, conducted a separate examination and\r\nalso agreed with Latona that the prints were Oswald’s.[C4-231]\r\n\r\nIn evaluating the significance of these fingerprint and palmprint\r\nidentifications, the Commission considered the possibility that Oswald\r\nhandled these cartons as part of his normal duties. Since other\r\nidentifiable prints were developed on the cartons, the Commission\r\nrequested that they be compared with the prints of the 12 warehouse\r\nemployees who, like Oswald, might have handled the cartons. They were\r\nalso compared with the prints of those law enforcement officials who\r\nmight have handled the cartons. The results of this investigation are\r\nfully discussed in chapter VI, page 249. Although a person could handle\r\na carton and not leave identifiable prints, none of these employees\r\nexcept Oswald left identifiable prints on the cartons.[C4-232] This\r\nfinding, in addition to the freshness of one of the prints and the\r\npresence of Oswald’s prints on two of the four cartons and the\r\npaper bag led the Commission to attach some probative value to the\r\nfingerprint and palmprint identifications in reaching the conclusion\r\nthat Oswald was at the window from which the shots were fired, although\r\nthe prints do not establish the exact time he was there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2707\r\n\r\nSIXTH FLOOR, TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY DALLAS, TEXAS]\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald’s Presence on Sixth Floor Approximately 35 Minutes Before the\r\nAssassination\r\n\r\nAdditional testimony linking Oswald with the point from which the\r\nshots were fired was provided by the testimony of Charles Givens, who\r\nwas the last known employee to see Oswald inside the building prior\r\nto the assassination. During the morning of November 22, Givens was\r\nworking with the floor-laying crew in the southwest section of the\r\nsixth floor.[C4-233] At about 11:45 a.m. the floor-laying crew used\r\nboth elevators to come down from the sixth floor. The employees raced\r\nthe elevators to the first floor.[C4-234] Givens saw Oswald standing\r\nat the gate on the fifth floor as the elevator went by.[C4-235] Givens\r\ntestified that after reaching the first floor, “I discovered I left\r\nmy cigarettes in my jacket pocket upstairs, and I took the elevator\r\nback upstairs to get my jacket with my cigarettes in it.”[C4-236] He\r\nsaw Oswald, a clipboard in hand, walking from the southeast corner\r\nof the sixth floor toward the elevator.[C4-237] (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 2707, p. 142.) Givens said to Oswald, “Boy are you going\r\ndownstairs? * * * It’s near lunch time.” Oswald said, “No, sir. When\r\nyou get downstairs, close the gate to the elevator.”[C4-238] Oswald was\r\nreferring to the west elevator which operates by pushbutton and only\r\nwith the gate closed.[C4-239] Givens said, “Okay,” and rode down in the\r\neast elevator. When he reached the first floor, the west elevator--the\r\none with the gate--was not there. Givens thought this was about 11:55\r\na.m.[C4-240] None of the Depository employees is known to have seen\r\nOswald again until after the shooting.[C4-241]\r\n\r\nThe significance of Givens’ observation that Oswald was carrying his\r\nclipboard became apparent on December 2, 1963, when an employee,\r\nFrankie Kaiser, found a clipboard hidden by book cartons in the\r\nnorthwest corner of the sixth floor at the west wall a few feet from\r\nwhere the rifle had been found.[C4-242] This clipboard had been made\r\nby Kaiser and had his name on it.[C4-243] Kaiser identified it as the\r\nclipboard which Oswald had appropriated from him when Oswald came to\r\nwork at the Depository.[C4-244] Three invoices on this clipboard,\r\neach dated November 22, were for Scott-Foresman books, located on the\r\nfirst and sixth floors.[C4-245] Oswald had not filled any of the three\r\norders.[C4-246]\r\n\r\n\r\nEyewitness Identification of Assassin\r\n\r\nHoward L. Brennan was an eyewitness to the shooting. As indicated\r\npreviously the Commission considered his testimony as probative in\r\nreaching the conclusion that the shots came from the sixth floor,\r\nsoutheast corner window of the Depository Building.[C4-247] (See ch.\r\nIII, pp. 61-68.) Brennan also testified that Lee Harvey Oswald, whom\r\nhe viewed in a police lineup on the night of the assassination, was\r\nthe man he saw fire the shots from the sixth-floor window of the\r\nDepository Building.[C4-248] When the shots were fired, Brennan was in\r\nan excellent position to observe anyone in the window. He was sitting\r\non a concrete wall on the southwest corner of Elm and Houston Streets,\r\nlooking north at the Depository Building which was directly in front of\r\nhim.[C4-249] The window was approximately 120 feet away.[C4-250](See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 477, p. 62.)\r\n\r\nIn the 6- to 8-minute period before the motorcade arrived,[C4-251]\r\nBrennan saw a man leave and return to the window “a couple of\r\ntimes.”[C4-252] After hearing the first shot, which he thought was a\r\nmotorcycle backfire, Brennan glanced up at the window. He testified\r\nthat “this man I saw previously was aiming for his last shot * * *\r\nas it appeared to me he was standing up and resting against the left\r\nwindow sill * * *.”[C4-253]\r\n\r\nBrennan saw the man fire the last shot and disappear from the window.\r\nWithin minutes of the assassination, Brennan described the man to the\r\npolice.[C4-254] This description most probably led to the radio alert\r\nsent to police cars at approximately 12:45 p.m., which described the\r\nsuspect as white, slender, weighing about 165 pounds, about 5’10” tall,\r\nand in his early thirties.[C4-255] In his sworn statement to the police\r\nlater that day, Brennan described the man in similar terms, except\r\nthat he gave the weight as between 165 and 175 pounds and the height\r\nwas omitted.[C4-256] In his testimony before the Commission, Brennan\r\ndescribed the person he saw as “* * * a man in his early thirties,\r\nfair complexion, slender, but neat, neat slender, possible 5 foot 10 *\r\n* * 160 to 170 pounds.”[C4-257] Oswald was 5’9”, slender and 24 years\r\nold. When arrested, he gave his weight as 140 pounds.[C4-258] On other\r\noccasions he gave weights of both 140 and 150 pounds.[C4-259] The New\r\nOrleans police records of his arrest in August of 1963 show a weight of\r\n136 pounds.[C4-260] The autopsy report indicated an estimated weight of\r\n150 pounds.[C4-261]\r\n\r\nBrennan’s description should also be compared with the eyewitness\r\ndescription broadcast over the Dallas police radio at 1:22 p.m. of the\r\nman who shot Patrolman J. D. Tippit. The suspect was described as “a\r\nwhite male about 30, 5’8”, black hair, slender. * * *”[C4-262] At 1:29\r\np.m. the police radio reported that the description of the suspect in\r\nthe Tippit shooting was similar to the description which had been given\r\nby Brennan in connection with the assassination.[C4-263] Approximately\r\n7 or 8 minutes later the police radio reported that “an eyeball\r\nwitness” described the suspect in the Tippit shooting as “a white male,\r\n27, 5’11”, 165 pounds, black wavy hair.”[C4-264] As will be discussed\r\nfully below, the Commission has concluded that this suspect was Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nAlthough Brennan testified that the man in the window was standing\r\nwhen he fired the shots,[C4-265] most probably he was either sitting\r\nor kneeling. The half-open window,[C4-266] the arrangement of the\r\nboxes,[C4-267] and the angle of the shots virtually preclude a standing\r\nposition.[C4-268] It is understandable, however, for Brennan to have\r\nbelieved that the man with the rifle was standing. A photograph\r\nof the building taken seconds after the assassination shows three\r\nemployees looking out of the fifth-floor window directly below the\r\nwindow from which the shots were fired. Brennan testified that\r\nthey were standing,[C4-269] which is their apparent position in the\r\nphotograph.[C4-270] (See Dillard Exhibits Nos. C and D. pp. 66-67.) But\r\nthe testimony of these employees,[C4-271] together with photographs\r\nsubsequently taken of them at the scene of the assassination,[C4-272]\r\nestablishes that they were either squatting or kneeling. (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 485, p. 69.) Since the window ledges in the\r\nDepository Building are lower than in most buildings,[C4-273] a person\r\nsquatting or kneeling exposes more of his body than would normally be\r\nthe case. From the street, this creates the impression that the person\r\nis standing. Brennan could have seen enough of the body of a kneeling\r\nor squatting person to estimate his height.\r\n\r\nShortly after the assassination Brennan noticed two of these employees\r\nleaving the building and immediately identified them as having been\r\nin the fifth-floor windows.[C4-274] When the three employees appeared\r\nbefore the Commission, Brennan identified the two whom he saw leave the\r\nbuilding.[C4-275] The two men, Harold Norman and James Jarman, Jr.,\r\neach confirmed that when they came out of the building, they saw and\r\nheard Brennan describing what he had seen.[C4-276] Norman stated, “*\r\n* * I remember him talking and I believe I remember seeing him saying\r\nthat he saw us when we first went up to the fifth-floor window, he saw\r\nus then.”[C4-277] Jarman heard Brennan “talking to this officer about\r\nthat he had heard these shots and he had seen the barrel of the gun\r\nsticking out the window, and he said that the shots came from inside\r\nthe building.”[C4-278]\r\n\r\nDuring the evening of November 22, Brennan identified Oswald as\r\nthe person in the lineup who bore the closest resemblance to the\r\nman in the window but he said he was unable to make a positive\r\nidentification.[C4-279] Prior to the lineup, Brennan had seen Oswald’s\r\npicture on television and he told the Commission that whether this\r\naffected his identification “is something I do not know.”[C4-280] In\r\nan interview with FBI agents on December 17, 1963, Brennan stated\r\nthat he was sure that the person firing the rifle was Oswald.[C4-281]\r\nIn another interview with FBI agents on January 7, 1964, Brennan\r\nappeared to revert to his earlier inability to make a positive\r\nidentification,[C4-282] but, in his testimony before the Commission,\r\nBrennan stated that his remarks of January 7 were intended by him\r\nmerely as an accurate report of what he said on November 22.[C4-283]\r\n\r\nBrennan told the Commission that he could have made a positive\r\nidentification in the lineup on November 22 but did not do so because\r\nhe felt that the assassination was “a Communist activity, and I felt\r\nlike there hadn’t been more than one eyewitness, and if it got to be a\r\nknown fact that I was an eyewitness, my family or I, either one, might\r\nnot be safe.”[C4-284] When specifically asked before the Commission\r\nwhether or not he could positively identify the man he saw in the\r\nsixth-floor window as the same man he saw in the police station,\r\nBrennan stated, “I could at that time--I could, with all sincerity,\r\nidentify him as being the same man.”[C4-285]\r\n\r\nAlthough the record indicates that Brennan was an accurate observer,\r\nhe declined to make a positive identification of Oswald when he first\r\nsaw him in the police lineup.[C4-286] The Commission, therefore, does\r\nnot base its conclusion concerning the identity of the assassin on\r\nBrennan’s subsequent certain identification of Lee Harvey Oswald as\r\nthe man he saw fire the rifle. Immediately after the assassination,\r\nhowever, Brennan described to the police the man he saw in the window\r\nand then identified Oswald as the person who most nearly resembled the\r\nman he saw. The Commission is satisfied that, at the least, Brennan saw\r\na man in the window who closely resembled Lee Harvey Oswald, and that\r\nBrennan believes the man he saw was in fact Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nTwo other witnesses were able to offer partial descriptions of a\r\nman they saw in the southeast corner window of the sixth floor\r\napproximately 1 minute before the assassination, although neither\r\nwitness saw the shots being fired.[C4-287] Ronald Fischer and Robert\r\nEdwards were standing on the curb at the southwest corner of Elm and\r\nHouston Streets,[C4-288] the same corner where Brennan was sitting on\r\na concrete wall.[C4-289] Fischer testified that about 10 or 15 seconds\r\nbefore the motorcade turned onto Houston Street from Main Street,\r\nEdwards said, “Look at that guy there in that window.”[C4-290]\r\n\r\nFischer looked up and watched the man in the window for 10 or 15\r\nseconds and then started watching the motorcade, which came into view\r\non Houston Street.[C4-291] He said that the man held his attention\r\nuntil the motorcade came because the man:\r\n\r\n    * * * appeared uncomfortable for one, and secondly, he wasn’t\r\n    watching * * * he didn’t look like he was watching for the\r\n    parade. He looked like he was looking down toward the Trinity\r\n    River and the Triple Underpass down at the end--toward the end\r\n    of Elm Street. And * * * all the time I watched him, he never\r\n    moved his head, he never--he never moved anything. Just was\r\n    there transfixed.[C4-292]\r\n\r\nFischer placed the man in the easternmost window on the south side of\r\nthe Depository Building on either the fifth or the sixth floor.[C4-293]\r\nHe said that he could see the man from the middle of his chest to the\r\ntop of his head, and that as he was facing the window the man was in\r\nthe lower right-hand portion of the window and “seemed to be sitting\r\na little forward.”[C4-294] The man was dressed in a light-colored,\r\nopen-neck shirt which could have been either a sports shirt or a\r\nT-shirt, and he had brown hair, a slender face and neck with light\r\ncomplexion, and looked to be 22 or 24 years old.[C4-295] The person\r\nin the window was a white man and “looked to me like he was looking\r\nstraight at the Triple Underpass” down Elm Street.[C4-296] Boxes and\r\ncases were stacked behind him.[C4-297]\r\n\r\nApproximately 1 week after the assassination, according to Fischer,\r\npolicemen showed him a picture of Oswald.[C4-298] In his testimony\r\nhe said, “I told them that that could have been the man. * * * That\r\nthat could have been the man that I saw in the window in the School\r\nBook Depository Building, but that I was not sure.”[C4-299] Fischer\r\ndescribed the man’s hair as some shade of brown--“it wasn’t dark and it\r\nwasn’t light.”[C4-300] On November 22, Fischer had apparently described\r\nthe man as “light-headed.”[C4-301] Fischer explained that he did not\r\nmean by the earlier statement that the man was blond, but rather that\r\nhis hair was not black.[C4-302]\r\n\r\nRobert Edwards said that, while looking at the south side of the\r\nDepository Building shortly before the motorcade, he saw nothing of\r\nimportance “except maybe one individual who was up there in the corner\r\nroom of the sixth floor which was crowded in among boxes.”[C4-303] He\r\nsaid that this was a white man about average in size, “possibly thin,”\r\nand that he thought the man had light-brown hair.[C4-304] Fischer and\r\nEdwards did not see the man clearly enough or long enough to identify\r\nhim. Their testimony is of probative value, however, because their\r\nlimited description is consistent with that of the man who has been\r\nfound by the Commission, based on other evidence, to have fired the\r\nshots from the window.\r\n\r\nAnother person who saw the assassin as the shots were fired was Amos L.\r\nEuins, age 15, who was one of the first witnesses to alert the police\r\nto the Depository as the source of the shots, as has been discussed in\r\nchapter III.[C4-305] Euins, who was on the southwest corner of Elm and\r\nHouston Streets,[C4-306] testified that he could not describe the man\r\nhe saw in the window. According to Euins, however, as the man lowered\r\nhis head in order to aim the rifle down Elm Street, he appeared to have\r\na white bald spot on his head.[C4-307] Shortly after the assassination,\r\nEuins signed an affidavit describing the man as “white,”[C4-308] but\r\na radio reporter testified that Euins described the man to him as\r\n“colored.”[C4-309] In his Commission testimony, Euins stated that\r\nhe could not ascertain the man’s race and that the statement in the\r\naffidavit was intended to refer only to the white spot on the man’s\r\nhead and not to his race.[C4-310] A Secret Service agent who spoke to\r\nEuins approximately 20 to 30 minutes after the assassination confirmed\r\nthat Euins could neither describe the man in the window nor indicate\r\nhis race.[C4-311] Accordingly, Euins’ testimony is considered probative\r\nas to the source of the shots but is inconclusive as to the identity of\r\nthe man in the window.\r\n\r\nIn evaluating the evidence that Oswald was at the southeast corner\r\nwindow of the sixth floor at the time of the shooting, the Commission\r\nhas considered the allegation that Oswald was photographed standing in\r\nfront of the building when the shots were fired. The picture which gave\r\nrise to these allegations was taken by Associated Press Photographer\r\nJames W. Altgens, who was standing on the south side of Elm Street\r\nbetween the Triple Underpass and the Depository Building.[C4-312] As\r\nthe motorcade started its descent down Elm Street, Altgens snapped\r\na picture of the Presidential limousine with the entrance to the\r\nDepository Building in the background.[C4-313] Just before snapping\r\nthe picture Altgens heard a noise which sounded like the popping of\r\na firecracker. Investigation has established that Altgens’ picture\r\nwas taken approximately 2 seconds after the firing of the shot which\r\nentered the back of the President’s neck.[C4-314]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1061\r\n\r\nTEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY DIAGRAM OF FIRST FLOOR]\r\n\r\nIn the background of this picture were several employees watching\r\nthe parade from the steps of the Depository Building. One of these\r\nemployees was alleged to resemble Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-315] The\r\nCommission has determined that the employee was in fact Billy\r\nNolan Lovelady, who identified himself in the picture.[C4-316]\r\nStanding alongside him were Buell Wesley Frazier[C4-317] and William\r\nShelley,[C4-318] who also identified Lovelady. The Commission is\r\nsatisfied that Oswald does not appear in this photograph. (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 900, p. 113.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald’s Actions in Building After Assassination\r\n\r\nIn considering whether Oswald was at the southeast corner window at the\r\ntime the shots were fired, the Commission has reviewed the testimony\r\nof witnesses who saw Oswald in the building within minutes after the\r\nassassination. The Commission has found that Oswald’s movements, as\r\ndescribed by these witnesses, are consistent with his having been at\r\nthe window at 12:30 p.m.\r\n\r\n_The encounter in the lunchroom._--The first person to see Oswald\r\nafter the assassination was Patrolman M. L. Baker of the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment. Baker was riding a two-wheeled motorcycle behind the last\r\npress car of the motorcade.[C4-319] As he turned the corner from Main\r\nonto Houston at a speed of about 5 to 10 miles per hour,[C4-320] a\r\nstrong wind blowing from the north almost unseated him.[C4-321] At\r\nabout this time he heard the first shot.[C4-322] Having recently\r\nheard the sounds of rifles while on a hunting trip, Baker recognized\r\nthe shots as that of a high-powered rifle; “it sounded high and I\r\nimmediately kind of looked up, and I had a feeling that it came from\r\nthe building, either right in front of me [the Depository Building]\r\nor of the one across to the right of it.”[C4-323] He saw pigeons\r\nflutter upward. He was not certain, “but I am pretty sure they came\r\nfrom the building right on the northwest corner.”[C4-324] He heard two\r\nmore shots spaced “pretty well even to me.”[C4-325] After the third\r\nshot, he “revved that motorcycle up,” drove to the northwest corner\r\nof Elm and Houston, and parked approximately 10 feet from the traffic\r\nsignal.[C4-326] As he was parking he noted that people were “falling,\r\nand they were rolling around down there * * * grabbing their children”\r\nand rushing about.[C4-327] A woman screamed, “Oh, they have shot that\r\nman, they have shot that man.”[C4-328] Baker “had it in mind that the\r\nshots came from the top of this building here,” so he ran straight to\r\nthe entrance of the Depository Building.[C4-329]\r\n\r\nBaker testified that he entered the lobby of the building and “spoke\r\nout and asked where the stairs or elevator was * * * and this man,\r\nMr. Truly, spoke up and says, it seems to me like he says, ‘I am a\r\nbuilding manager. Follow me, officer, and I will show you.’”[C4-330]\r\nBaker and building superintendent Roy Truly went through a second set\r\nof doors[C4-331] and stopped at a swinging door where Baker bumped into\r\nTruly’s back.[C4-332] They went through the swinging door and continued\r\nat “a good trot” to the northwest corner of the floor where Truly hoped\r\nto find one of the two freight elevators. (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n1061, p. 148.) Neither elevator was there.[C4-333] Truly pushed the\r\nbutton for the west elevator which operates automatically if the gate\r\nis closed.[C4-334] He shouted twice, “Turn loose the elevator.”[C4-335]\r\nWhen the elevator failed to come, Baker said, “let’s take the stairs,”\r\nand he followed Truly up the stairway, which is to the west of the\r\nelevator.[C4-336]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1118\r\n\r\nTEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY DIAGRAM OF SECOND FLOOR SHOWING ROUTE OF\r\nOSWALD]\r\n\r\nThe stairway is located in the northwest corner of the Depository\r\nBuilding. The stairs from one floor to the next are “=L=-shaped,”\r\nwith both legs of the “=L=” approximately the same length. Because\r\nthe stairway itself is enclosed, neither Baker nor Truly could see\r\nanything on the second-floor hallway until they reached the landing at\r\nthe top of the stairs.[C4-337] On the second-floor landing there is a\r\nsmall open area with a door at the east end. This door leads into a\r\nsmall vestibule, and another door leads from the vestibule into the\r\nsecond-floor lunchroom.[C4-338] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1118, p.\r\n150.) The lunchroom door is usually open, but the first door is kept\r\nshut by a closing mechanism on the door.[C4-339] This vestibule door\r\nis solid except for a small glass window in the upper part of the\r\ndoor.[C4-340] As Baker reached the second floor, he was about 20 feet\r\nfrom the vestibule door.[C4-341] He intended to continue around to his\r\nleft toward the stairway going up but through the window in the door he\r\ncaught a fleeting glimpse of a man walking in the vestibule toward the\r\nlunchroom.[C4-342]\r\n\r\nSince the vestibule door is only a few feet from the lunchroom\r\ndoor,[C4-343] the man must have entered the vestibule only a second\r\nor two before Baker arrived at the top of the stairwell. Yet he must\r\nhave entered the vestibule door before Truly reached the top of the\r\nstairwell, since Truly did not see him.[C4-344] If the man had passed\r\nfrom the vestibule into the lunchroom, Baker could not have seen him.\r\nBaker said:\r\n\r\n    He [Truly] had already started around the bend to come to the\r\n    next elevator going up, I was coming out this one on the second\r\n    floor, and I don’t know, I was kind of sweeping this area as I\r\n    come up, I was looking from right to left and as I got to this\r\n    door here I caught a glimpse of this man, just, you know, a\r\n    sudden glimpse * * * and it looked to me like he was going away\r\n    from me. * * *\r\n\r\n    I can’t say whether he had gone on through that door [the\r\n    lunchroom door] or not. All I did was catch a glance at him,\r\n    and evidently he was--this door might have been, you know,\r\n    closing and almost shut at that time.[C4-345]\r\n\r\nWith his revolver drawn, Baker opened the vestibule door and ran into\r\nthe vestibule. He saw a man walking away from him in the lunchroom.\r\nBaker stopped at the door of the lunchroom and commanded, “Come\r\nhere.”[C4-346] The man turned and walked back toward Baker.[C4-347] He\r\nhad been proceeding toward the rear of the lunchroom.[C4-348] Along a\r\nside wall of the lunchroom was a soft drink vending machine,[C4-349]\r\nbut at that time the man had nothing in his hands.[C4-350]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Truly had run up several steps toward the third floor.\r\nMissing Baker, he came back to find the officer in the doorway to the\r\nlunchroom “facing Lee Harvey Oswald.”[C4-351] Baker turned to Truly\r\nand said, “Do you know this man, does he work here?”[C4-352] Truly\r\nreplied, “Yes.”[C4-353] Baker stated later that the man did not seem to\r\nbe out of breath; he seemed calm. “He never did say a word or nothing.\r\nIn fact, he didn’t change his expression one bit.”[C4-354] Truly said\r\nof Oswald: “He didn’t seem to be excited or overly afraid or anything.\r\nHe might have been a bit startled, like I might have been if somebody\r\nconfronted me. But I cannot recall any change in expression of any kind\r\non his face.”[C4-355] Truly thought that the officer’s gun at that time\r\nappeared to be almost touching the middle portion of Oswald’s body.\r\nTruly also noted at this time that Oswald’s hands were empty.[C4-356]\r\n\r\nIn an effort to determine whether Oswald could have descended to the\r\nlunchroom from the sixth floor by the time Baker and Truly arrived,\r\nCommission counsel asked Baker and Truly to repeat their movements from\r\nthe time of the shot until Baker came upon Oswald in the lunchroom.\r\nBaker placed himself on a motorcycle about 200 feet from the corner\r\nof Elm and Houston Streets where he said he heard the shots.[C4-357]\r\nTruly stood in front of the building.[C4-358] At a given signal, they\r\nreenacted the event. Baker’s movements were timed with a stopwatch. On\r\nthe first test, the elapsed time between the simulated first shot and\r\nBaker’s arrival on the second-floor stair landing was 1 minute and 30\r\nseconds. The second test run required 1 minute and 15 seconds.[C4-359]\r\n\r\nA test was also conducted to determine the time required to walk from\r\nthe southeast corner of the sixth floor to the second-floor lunchroom\r\nby stairway. Special Agent John Howlett of the Secret Service carried\r\na rifle from the southeast corner of the sixth floor along the east\r\naisle to the northeast corner. He placed the rifle on the floor near\r\nthe site where Oswald’s rifle was actually found after the shooting.\r\nThen Howlett walked down the stairway to the second-floor landing and\r\nentered the lunchroom. The first test, run at normal walking pace,\r\nrequired 1 minute, 18 seconds;[C4-360] the second test, at a “fast\r\nwalk” took 1 minute, 14 seconds.[C4-361] The second test followed\r\nimmediately after the first. The only interval was the time necessary\r\nto ride in the elevator from the second to the sixth floor and walk\r\nback to the southeast corner. Howlett was not short winded at the end\r\nof either test run.[C4-362]\r\n\r\nThe minimum time required by Baker to park his motorcycle and reach\r\nthe second-floor lunchroom was within 3 seconds of the time needed to\r\nwalk from the southeast corner of the sixth floor down the stairway to\r\nthe lunchroom. The time actually required for Baker and Truly to reach\r\nthe second floor on November 22 was probably longer than in the test\r\nruns. For example, Baker required 15 seconds after the simulated shot\r\nto ride his motorcycle 180 to 200 feet, park it, and run 45 feet to the\r\nbuilding.[C4-363] No allowance was made for the special conditions\r\nwhich existed on the day of the assassination--possible delayed\r\nreaction to the shot, jostling with the crowd of people on the steps\r\nand scanning the area along Elm Street and the parkway.[C4-364] Baker\r\nsaid, “We simulated the shots and by the time we got there, we did\r\neverything that I did that day, and this would be the minimum, because\r\nI am sure that I, you know, it took me a little longer.”[C4-365] On\r\nthe basis of this time test, therefore, the Commission concluded that\r\nOswald could have fired the shots and still have been present in the\r\nsecond-floor lunchroom when seen by Baker and Truly.\r\n\r\nThat Oswald descended by stairway from the sixth floor to the\r\nsecond-floor lunchroom is consistent with the movements of the two\r\nelevators, which would have provided the other possible means of\r\ndescent. When Truly, accompanied by Baker, ran to the rear of the\r\nfirst floor, he was certain that both elevators, which occupy the same\r\nshaft,[C4-366] were on the fifth floor.[C4-367] Baker, not realizing\r\nthat there were two elevators, thought that only one elevator was\r\nin the shaft and that it was two or three floors above the second\r\nfloor.[C4-368] In the few seconds which elapsed while Baker and Truly\r\nran from the first to the second floor, neither of these slow elevators\r\ncould have descended from the fifth to the second floor. Furthermore,\r\nno elevator was at the second floor when they arrived there.[C4-369]\r\nTruly and Baker continued up the stairs after the encounter with Oswald\r\nin the lunchroom. There was no elevator on the third or fourth floor.\r\nThe east elevator was on the fifth floor when they arrived; the west\r\nelevator was not. They took the east elevator to the seventh floor\r\nand ran up a stairway to the roof where they searched for several\r\nminutes.[C4-370]\r\n\r\nJack Dougherty, an employee working on the fifth floor, testified\r\nthat he took the west elevator to the first floor after hearing a\r\nnoise which sounded like a backfire.[C4-371] Eddie Piper, the janitor,\r\ntold Dougherty that the President had been shot,[C4-372] but in his\r\ntestimony Piper did not mention either seeing or talking with Dougherty\r\nduring these moments of excitement.[C4-373] Both Dougherty and Piper\r\nwere confused witnesses. They had no exact memory of the events of that\r\nafternoon. Truly was probably correct in stating that the west elevator\r\nwas on the fifth floor when he looked up the elevator shaft from the\r\nfirst floor. The west elevator was not on the fifth floor when Baker\r\nand Truly reached that floor, probably because Jack Dougherty took it\r\nto the first floor while Baker and Truly were running up the stairs or\r\nin the lunchroom with Oswald. Neither elevator could have been used by\r\nOswald as a means of descent.\r\n\r\nOswald’s use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of other\r\nemployees in the building. Three employees--James Jarman, Jr., Harold\r\nNorman, and Bonnie Ray Williams--were watching the parade from the\r\nfifth floor, directly below the window from which the shots were fired.\r\nThey rushed to the west windows after the shots were fired and remained\r\nthere until after they saw Patrolman Baker’s white helmet on the fifth\r\nfloor moving toward the elevator.[C4-374] While they were at the west\r\nwindows their view of the stairwell was completely blocked by shelves\r\nand boxes.[C4-375] This is the period during which Oswald would have\r\ndescended the stairs. In all likelihood Dougherty took the elevator\r\ndown from the fifth floor after Jarman, Norman, and Williams ran to the\r\nwest windows and were deciding what to do. None of these three men saw\r\nDougherty, probably because of the anxiety of the moment and because\r\nof the books which may have blocked the view.[C4-376] Neither Jarman,\r\nNorman, Williams, or Dougherty saw Oswald.[C4-377]\r\n\r\nVictoria Adams, who worked on the fourth floor of the Depository\r\nBuilding, claimed that within about 1 minute following the shots she\r\nran from a window on the south side of the fourth floor,[C4-378]\r\ndown the rear stairs to the first floor, where she encountered two\r\nDepository employees--William Shelley and Billy Lovelady.[C4-379] If\r\nher estimate of time is correct, she reached the bottom of the stairs\r\nbefore Truly and Baker started up, and she must have run down the\r\nstairs ahead of Oswald and would probably have seen or heard him.\r\nActually she noticed no one on the back stairs. If she descended from\r\nthe fourth to the first floor as fast as she claimed in her testimony,\r\nshe would have seen Baker or Truly on the first floor or on the stairs,\r\nunless they were already in the second-floor lunchroom talking to\r\nOswald. When she reached the first floor, she actually saw Shelley and\r\nLovelady slightly east of the east elevator.\r\n\r\nShelley and Lovelady, however, have testified that they were watching\r\nthe parade from the top step of the building entrance when Gloria\r\nCalverly, who works in the Depository Building, ran up and said that\r\nthe President had been shot.[C4-380] Lovelady and Shelley moved\r\nout into the street.[C4-381] About this time Shelley saw Truly and\r\nPatrolman Baker go into the building.[C4-382] Shelley and Lovelady, at\r\na fast walk or trot, turned west into the railroad yards and then to\r\nthe west side of the Depository Building. They reentered the building\r\nby the rear door several minutes after Baker and Truly rushed through\r\nthe front entrance.[C4-383] On entering, Lovelady saw a girl on the\r\nfirst floor who he believes was Victoria Adams.[C4-384] If Miss Adams\r\naccurately recalled meeting Shelley and Lovelady when she reached the\r\nbottom of the stairs, then her estimate of the time when she descended\r\nfrom the fourth floor is incorrect, and she actually came down the\r\nstairs several minutes after Oswald and after Truly and Baker as well.\r\n\r\n_Oswald’s departure from building._--Within a minute after Baker\r\nand Truly left Oswald in the lunchroom, Mrs. R. A. Reid, clerical\r\nsupervisor for the Texas School Book Depository, saw him walk through\r\nthe clerical office on the second floor toward the door leading to the\r\nfront stairway. Mrs. Reid had watched the parade from the sidewalk in\r\nfront of the building with Truly and Mr. O. V. Campbell, vice president\r\nof the Depository.[C4-385] She testified that she heard three shots\r\nwhich she thought came from the building.[C4-386] She ran inside and\r\nup the front stairs into the large open office reserved for clerical\r\nemployees. As she approached her desk, she saw Oswald.[C4-387] He\r\nwas walking into the office from the back hallway, carrying a full\r\nbottle of Coca-Cola in his hand,[C4-388] presumably purchased after\r\nthe encounter with Baker and Truly. As Oswald passed Mrs. Reid she\r\nsaid, “Oh, the President has been shot, but maybe they didn’t hit\r\nhim.”[C4-389] Oswald mumbled something and walked by.[C4-390] She\r\npaid no more attention to him. The only exit from the office in\r\nthe direction Oswald was moving was through the door to the front\r\nstairway.[C4-391] (See Commission Exhibit 1118, p. 150.) Mrs. Reid\r\ntestified that when she saw Oswald, he was wearing a T-shirt and no\r\njacket.[C4-392] When he left home that morning, Marina Oswald, who\r\nwas still in bed, suggested that he wear a jacket.[C4-393] A blue\r\njacket, later identified by Marina Oswald as her husband’s,[C4-394] was\r\nsubsequently found in the building,[C4-395] apparently left behind by\r\nOswald.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reid believes that she returned to her desk from the street about\r\n2 minutes after the shooting.[C4-396] Reconstructing her movements,\r\nMrs. Reid ran the distance three times and was timed in 2 minutes by\r\nstopwatch.[C4-397] The reconstruction was the minimum time.[C4-398]\r\nAccordingly, she probably met Oswald at about 12:32, approximately\r\n30-45 seconds after Oswald’s lunchroom encounter with Baker and Truly.\r\nAfter leaving Mrs. Reid in the front office, Oswald could have gone\r\ndown the stairs and out the front door by 12:33 p.m.[C4-399]--3 minutes\r\nafter the shooting. At that time the building had not yet been sealed\r\noff by the police.\r\n\r\nWhile it was difficult to determine exactly when the police sealed off\r\nthe building, the earliest estimates would still have permitted Oswald\r\nto leave the building by 12:33. One of the police officers assigned to\r\nthe corner of Elm and Houston Streets for the Presidential motorcade,\r\nW.E. Barnett, testified that immediately after the shots he went to\r\nthe rear of the building to check the fire escape. He then returned to\r\nthe corner of Elm and Houston where he met a sergeant who instructed\r\nhim to find out the name of the building. Barnett ran to the building,\r\nnoted its name, and then returned to the corner.[C4-400] There he was\r\nmet by a construction worker--in all likelihood Howard Brennan, who\r\nwas wearing his work helmet.[C4-401] This worker told Barnett that\r\nthe shots had been fired from a window in the Depository Building,\r\nwhereupon Barnett posted himself at the front door to make certain that\r\nno one left the building. The sergeant did the same thing at the rear\r\nof the building.[C4-402] Barnett estimated that approximately 3 minutes\r\nelapsed between the time he heard the last of the shots and the time\r\nhe started guarding the front door. According to Barnett, “there were\r\npeople going in and out” during this period.[C4-403]\r\n\r\nSgt. D. V. Harkness of the Dallas police said that to his knowledge\r\nthe building was not sealed off at 12:36 p.m. when he called in on\r\npolice radio that a witness (Amos Euins) had seen shots fired from a\r\nwindow of the building.[C4-404] At that time, Inspector Herbert V.\r\nSawyer’s car was parked in front of the building.[C4-405] Harkness did\r\nnot know whether or not two officers with Sawyer were guarding the\r\ndoors.[C4-406] At 12:34 p.m. Sawyer heard a call over the police radio\r\nthat the shots had come from the Depository Building.[C4-407] He then\r\nentered the building and took the front passenger elevator as far as\r\nit would go--the fourth floor.[C4-408] After inspecting this floor,\r\nSawyer returned to the street about 3 minutes after he entered the\r\nbuilding.[C4-409] After he returned to the street he directed Sergeant\r\nHarkness to station two patrolmen at the front door and not let anyone\r\nin or out; he also directed that the back door be sealed off.[C4-410]\r\nThis was no earlier than 12:37 p.m.[C4-411] and may have been later.\r\nSpecial Agent Forrest V. Sorrels of the Secret Service, who had been\r\nin the motorcade, testified that after driving to Parkland Hospital,\r\nhe returned to the Depository Building about 20 minutes after the\r\nshooting, found no police officers at the rear door and was able to\r\nenter through this door without identifying himself.[C4-412]\r\n\r\nAlthough Oswald probably left the building at about 12:33 p.m., his\r\nabsence was not noticed until at least one-half hour later. Truly,\r\nwho had returned with Patrolman Baker from the roof, saw the police\r\nquestioning the warehouse employees. Approximately 15 men worked in the\r\nwarehouse[C4-413] and Truly noticed that Oswald was not among those\r\nbeing questioned.[C4-414] Satisfying himself that Oswald was missing,\r\nTruly obtained Oswald’s address, phone number, and description from\r\nhis employment application card. The address listed was for the Paine\r\nhome in Irving. Truly gave this information to Captain Fritz who was on\r\nthe sixth floor at the time[C4-415]. Truly estimated that he gave this\r\ninformation to Fritz about 15 or 20 minutes after the shots,[C4-416]\r\nbut it was probably no earlier than 1:22 p.m., the time when the rifle\r\nwas found. Fritz believed that he learned of Oswald’s absence after\r\nthe rifle was found.[C4-417] The fact that Truly found Fritz in the\r\nnorthwest corner of the floor, near the point where the rifle was\r\nfound, supports Fritz’ recollection.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nFingerprint and palmprint evidence establishes that Oswald handled\r\ntwo of the four cartons next to the window and also handled a paper\r\nbag which was found near the cartons. Oswald was seen in the vicinity\r\nof the southeast corner of the sixth floor approximately 35 minutes\r\nbefore the assassination and no one could be found who saw Oswald\r\nanywhere else in the building until after the shooting. An eyewitness\r\nto the shooting immediately provided a description of the man in the\r\nwindow which was similar to Oswald’s actual appearance. This witness\r\nidentified Oswald in a lineup as the man most nearly resembling the man\r\nhe saw and later identified Oswald as the man he observed. Oswald’s\r\nknown actions in the building immediately after the assassination are\r\nconsistent with his having been at the southeast corner window of the\r\nsixth floor at 12:30 p.m. On the basis of these findings the Commission\r\nhas concluded that Oswald, at the time of the assassination, was\r\npresent at the window from which the shots were fired.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KILLING OF PATROLMAN J. D. TIPPIT\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Depository Building at approximately 12:33 p.m.,\r\nLee Harvey Oswald proceeded to his roominghouse by bus and taxi. He\r\narrived at approximately 1 p.m. and left a few minutes later. At about\r\n1:16 p.m., a Dallas police officer, J. D. Tippit, was shot less than\r\n1 mile from Oswald’s roominghouse. In deciding whether Oswald killed\r\nPatrolman Tippit the Commission considered the following: (1) positive\r\nidentification of the killer by two eyewitnesses who saw the shooting\r\nand seven eyewitnesses who heard the shots and saw the gunman flee\r\nthe scene with the revolver in his hand, (2) testimony of firearms\r\nidentification experts establishing the identity of the murder weapon,\r\n(3) evidence establishing the ownership of the murder weapon, (4)\r\nevidence establishing the ownership of a zipper jacket found along the\r\npath of flight taken by the gunman from the scene of the shooting to\r\nthe place of arrest.\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald’s Movements After Leaving Depository Building\r\n\r\n_The bus ride._--According to the reconstruction of time and events\r\nwhich the Commission found most credible, Lee Harvey Oswald left the\r\nbuilding approximately 3 minutes after the assassination. He probably\r\nwalked east on Elm Street for seven blocks to the corner of Elm and\r\nMurphy where he boarded a bus which was heading back in the direction\r\nof the Depository Building, on its way to the Oak Cliff section of\r\nDallas. (See Commission Exhibit 1119-A, p. 158.)\r\n\r\nWhen Oswald was apprehended, a bus transfer marked for the\r\nLakewood-Marsalis route was found in his shirt pocket.[C4-418] The\r\ntransfer was dated “Fri. Nov. 22, ’63” and was punched in two places by\r\nthe busdriver. On the basis of this punchmark, which was distinctive\r\nto each Dallas driver, the transfer was conclusively identified as\r\nhaving been issued by Cecil J. McWatters, a busdriver for the Dallas\r\nTransit Co.[C4-419] On the basis of the date and time on the transfer,\r\nMcWatters was able to testify that the transfer had been issued by him\r\non a trip which passed a check point at St. Paul and Elm Streets at\r\n12:36 p.m., November 22, 1963.[C4-420]\r\n\r\nMcWatters was sure that he left the checkpoint on time and he\r\nestimated that it took him 3 to 4 minutes to drive three blocks west\r\nfrom the checkpoint to Field Street, which he reached at about 12:40\r\np.m.[C4-421] McWatters’ recollection is that he issued this transfer to\r\na man who entered his bus just beyond Field Street, where a man beat on\r\nthe front door of the bus, boarded it and paid his fare.[C4-422] About\r\ntwo blocks later, a woman asked to get off to make a 1 o’clock train at\r\nUnion Station and requested a transfer which she might use if she got\r\nthrough the traffic.\r\n\r\n    * * * So I gave her a transfer and opened the door and she was\r\n    going out the gentleman I had picked up about two blocks [back]\r\n    asked for a transfer and got off at the same place in the\r\n    middle of the block where the lady did.\r\n\r\n    * * * It was the intersection near Lamar Street, it was near\r\n    Poydras and Lamar Street.[C4-423]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1119-A\r\n\r\n  WHEREABOUTS OF\r\n  LEE HARVEY OSWALD\r\n  between\r\n  12:33 P.M. and 1:50 P.M.\r\n  November 22, 1963\r\n\r\n  (ALL TIMES ARE APPROXIMATE)\r\n] The man was on the bus approximately 4 minutes.[C4-424]\r\n\r\nAt about 6:30 p.m. on the day of the assassination, McWatters viewed\r\nfour men in a police lineup. He picked Oswald from the lineup as the\r\nman who had boarded the bus at the “lower end of town on Elm around\r\nHouston,” and who, during the ride south on Marsalis, had an argument\r\nwith a woman passenger.[C4-425] In his Commission testimony, McWatters\r\nsaid he had been in error and that a teenager named Milton Jones was\r\nthe passenger he had in mind.[C4-426] In a later interview, Jones\r\nconfirmed that he had exchanged words with a woman passenger on the bus\r\nduring the ride south on Marsalis.[C4-427] McWatters also remembered\r\nthat a man received a transfer at Lamar and Elm Streets and that a\r\nman in the lineup was about the size of this man.[C4-428] However,\r\nMcWatters’ recollection alone was too vague to be a basis for placing\r\nOswald on the bus.\r\n\r\nRiding on the bus was an elderly woman, Mary Bledsoe, who confirmed\r\nthe mute evidence of the transfer. Oswald had rented a room from Mrs.\r\nBledsoe about 6 weeks before, on October 7,[C4-429] but she had asked\r\nhim to leave at the end of a week. Mrs. Bledsoe told him “I am not\r\ngoing to rent to you any more.”[C4-430] She testified, “I didn’t like\r\nhis attitude. * * * There was just something about him I didn’t like or\r\nwant him. * * * Just didn’t want him around me.” [C4-431] On November\r\n22, Mrs. Bledsoe came downtown to watch the Presidential motorcade.\r\nShe boarded the Marsalis bus at St. Paul and Elm Streets to return\r\nhome.[C4-432] She testified further:\r\n\r\n    And, after we got past Akard, at Murphy--I figured it out.\r\n    Let’s see. I don’t know for sure. Oswald got on. He looks like\r\n    a maniac. His sleeve was out here. * * * His shirt was undone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Was a hole in it, hole, and he was dirty, and I didn’t look at\r\n    him. I didn’t want to know I even seen him * * *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    * * * he looked so bad in his face, and his face was so\r\n    distorted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Hole in his sleeve right here.[C4-433]\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Bledsoe said these words, she pointed to her right\r\nelbow.[C4-434] When Oswald was arrested in the Texas Theatre, he was\r\nwearing a brown sport shirt with a hole in the right sleeve at the\r\nelbow.[C4-435] Mrs. Bledsoe identified the shirt as the one Oswald was\r\nwearing and she stated she was certain that it was Oswald who boarded\r\nthe bus.[C4-436] Mrs. Bledsoe recalled that Oswald sat halfway to the\r\nrear of the bus which moved slowly and intermittently as traffic\r\nbecame heavy.[C4-437] She heard a passing motorist tell the driver that\r\nthe President had been shot.[C4-438] People on the bus began talking\r\nabout it. As the bus neared Lamar Street, Oswald left the bus and\r\ndisappeared into the crowd.[C4-439]\r\n\r\nThe Marsalis bus which Oswald boarded traveled a route west on Elm,\r\nsouth on Houston, and southwest across the Houston viaduct to service\r\nthe Oak Cliff area along Marsalis.[C4-440] A Beckley bus which also\r\nserved the Oak Cliff area, followed the same route as the Marsalis\r\nbus through downtown Dallas, except that it continued west on Elm,\r\nacross Houston in front of the Depository Building, past the Triple\r\nUnderpass into west Dallas, and south on Beckley.[C4-441] Marsalis\r\nStreet is seven blocks from Beckley.[C4-442] Oswald lived at 1026 North\r\nBeckley.[C4-443] He could not reach his roominghouse on the Marsalis\r\nbus, but the Beckley bus stopped across the street.[C4-444] According\r\nto McWatters, the Beckley bus was behind the Marsalis bus, but he did\r\nnot actually see it.[C4-445] Both buses stopped within one block of the\r\nDepository Building. Instead of waiting there, Oswald apparently went\r\nas far away as he could and boarded the first Oak Cliff bus which came\r\nalong rather than wait for one which stopped across the street from his\r\nroominghouse.\r\n\r\nIn a reconstruction of this bus trip, agents of the Secret Service\r\nand the FBI walked the seven blocks from the front entrance of the\r\nDepository Building to Murphy and Elm three times, averaging 6½ minutes\r\nfor the three trips.[C4-446] A bus moving through heavy traffic on\r\nElm from Murphy to Lamar was timed at 4 minutes.[C4-447] If Oswald\r\nleft the Depository Building at 12:33 p.m., walked seven blocks\r\ndirectly to Murphy and Elm, and boarded a bus almost immediately, he\r\nwould have boarded the bus at approximately 12:40 p.m. and left it at\r\napproximately 12:44 p.m. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1119-A, p. 158.)\r\n\r\nRoger D. Craig, a deputy sheriff of Dallas County, claimed that\r\nabout 15 minutes after the assassination he saw a man, whom he later\r\nidentified as Oswald,[C4-448] coming from the direction of the\r\nDepository Building and running down the hill north of Elm Street\r\ntoward a light-colored Rambler station wagon, which was moving slowly\r\nalong Elm toward the underpass.[C4-449] The station wagon stopped to\r\npick up the man and then drove off.[C4-450] Craig testified that later\r\nin the afternoon he saw Oswald in the police interrogation room and\r\ntold Captain Fritz that Oswald was the man he saw.[C4-451] Craig also\r\nclaimed that when Fritz pointed out to Oswald that Craig had identified\r\nhim, Oswald rose from his chair, looked directly at Fritz, and said,\r\n“Everybody will know who I am now.”[C4-452]\r\n\r\nThe Commission could not accept important elements of Craig’s\r\ntestimony. Captain Fritz stated that a deputy sheriff whom he could\r\nnot identify did ask to see him that afternoon and told him a similar\r\nstory to Craig’s.[C4-453] Fritz did not bring him into his office\r\nto identify Oswald but turned him over to Lieutenant Baker for\r\nquestioning. If Craig saw Oswald that afternoon, he saw him through the\r\nglass windows of the office. And neither Captain Fritz nor any other\r\nofficer can remember that Oswald dramatically arose from his chair\r\nand said, “Everybody will know who I am now.”[C4-454] If Oswald had\r\nmade such a statement, Captain Fritz and others present would probably\r\nhave remembered it. Craig may have seen a person enter a white Rambler\r\nstation wagon 15 or 20 minutes after the shooting and travel west on\r\nElm Street, but the Commission concluded that this man was not Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald, because of the overwhelming evidence that Oswald was far\r\naway from the building by that time.\r\n\r\n_The taxicab ride._--William Whaley, a taxicab driver, told his\r\nemployer on Saturday morning, November 23, that he recognized Oswald\r\nfrom a newspaper photograph as a man whom he had driven to the Oak\r\nCliff area the day before.[C4-455] Notified of Whaley’s statement, the\r\npolice brought him to the police station that afternoon. He was taken\r\nto the lineup room where, according to Whaley, five young teenagers,\r\nall handcuffed together, were displayed with Oswald.[C4-456] He\r\ntestified that Oswald looked older than the other boys.[C4-457] The\r\npolice asked him whether he could pick out his passenger from the\r\nlineup. Whaley picked Oswald. He said,\r\n\r\n    * * * you could have picked him out without identifying him by\r\n    just listening to him because he was bawling out the policeman,\r\n    telling them it wasn’t right to put him in line with these\r\n    teenagers and all of that and they asked me which one and I\r\n    told them. It was him all right, the same man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    He showed no respect for the policemen, he told them what he\r\n    thought about them. They knew what they were doing and they\r\n    were trying to railroad him and he wanted his lawyer.[C4-458]\r\n\r\nWhaley believes that Oswald’s conduct did not aid him in his\r\nidentification “because I knew he was the right one as soon as I saw\r\nhim.”[C4-459]\r\n\r\nWhaley’s memory of the lineup is inaccurate. There were four men\r\naltogether, not six men, in the lineup with Oswald.[C4-460] Whaley said\r\nthat Oswald was the man under No. 2.[C4-461] Actually Oswald was under\r\nNo. 3. Only two of the men in the lineup with Oswald were teenagers:\r\nJohn T. Horn, aged 18, was No. 1; David Knapp, aged 18, was No. 2; Lee\r\nOswald was No. 3; and Daniel Lujan, aged 26, was No. 4.[C4-462]\r\n\r\nWhen he first testified before the Commission, Whaley displayed a trip\r\nmanifest[C4-463] which showed a 12 o’clock trip from Travis Hotel to\r\nthe Continental bus station, unloaded at 12:15 p.m., a 12:15 p.m.\r\npickup at Continental to Greyhound, unloaded at 12:30 p.m., and a\r\npickup from Greyhound (bus station) at 12:30 p.m., unloaded at 500\r\nNorth Beckley at 12:45 p.m. Whaley testified that he did not keep an\r\naccurate time record of his trips but recorded them by the quarter\r\nhour, and that sometimes he made his entry right after a trip while\r\nat other times he waited to record three or four trips.[C4-464] As he\r\nunloaded his Continental bus station passenger in front of Greyhound,\r\nhe started to get out to buy a package of cigarettes.[C4-465] He saw a\r\nman walking south on Lamar from Commerce. The man was dressed in faded\r\nblue color khaki work clothes, a brown shirt, and some kind of work\r\njacket that almost matched his pants.[C4-466] The man asked, “May I\r\nhave the cab?”, and got into the front seat.[C4-467] Whaley described\r\nthe ensuing events as follows:\r\n\r\n    And about that time an old lady, I think she was an old lady,\r\n    I don’t remember nothing but her sticking her head down past\r\n    him in the door and said, “Driver, will you call me a cab down\r\n    here?”\r\n\r\n    She had seen him get this cab and she wanted one, too, and he\r\n    opened the door a little bit like he was going to get out and\r\n    he said, “I will let you have this one,” and she says, “No, the\r\n    driver can call me one.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    * * * I asked him where he wanted to go. And he said, “500\r\n    North Beckley.”\r\n\r\n    Well, I started up, I started to that address, and the police\r\n    cars, the sirens was going, running crisscrossing everywhere,\r\n    just a big uproar in that end of town and I said, “What the\r\n    hell. I wonder what the hell is the uproar?”\r\n\r\n    And he never said anything. So I figured he was one of these\r\n    people that don’t like to talk so I never said any more to him.\r\n\r\n    But when I got pretty close to 500 block at Neches and North\r\n    Beckley which is the 500 block, he said, “This will do fine,”\r\n    and I pulled over to the curb right there. He gave me a dollar\r\n    bill, the trip was 95 cents. He gave me a dollar bill and\r\n    didn’t say anything, just got out and closed the door and\r\n    walked around the front of the cab over to the other side of\r\n    the street [east side of the street]. Of course, the traffic\r\n    was moving through there and I put it in gear and moved on,\r\n    that is the last I saw of him.[C4-468]\r\n\r\nWhaley was somewhat imprecise as to where he unloaded his passenger.\r\nHe marked what he thought was the intersection of Neches and Beckley\r\non a map of Dallas with a large “X.”[C4-469] He said, “Yes, sir; that\r\nis right, because that is the 500 block of North Beckley.”[C4-470]\r\nHowever, Neches and Beckley do not intersect. Neches is within one-half\r\nblock of the roominghouse at 1026 North Beckley where Oswald was\r\nliving. The 500 block of North Beckley is five blocks south of the\r\nroominghouse.[C4-471]\r\n\r\nAfter a review of these inconsistencies in his testimony before the\r\nCommission, Whaley was interviewed again in Dallas. The route of the\r\ntaxicab was retraced under the direction of Whaley.[C4-472] He directed\r\nthe driver of the car to a point 20 feet north of the northwest\r\ncorner of the intersection of Beckley and Neely, the point at which\r\nhe said his passenger alighted.[C4-473] This was the 700 block of\r\nNorth Beckley.[C4-474] The elapsed time of the reconstructed run from\r\nthe Greyhound Bus Station to Neely and Beckley was 5 minutes and 30\r\nseconds by stopwatch.[C4-475] The walk from Beckley and Neely to 1026\r\nNorth Beckley was timed by Commission counsel at 5 minutes and 45\r\nseconds.[C4-476]\r\n\r\nWhaley testified that Oswald was wearing either the gray zippered\r\njacket or the heavy blue jacket.[C4-477] He was in error, however.\r\nOswald could not possibly have been wearing the blue jacket during\r\nthe trip with Whaley, since it was found in the “domino” room of\r\nthe Depository late in November.[C4-478] Moreover, Mrs. Bledsoe saw\r\nOswald in the bus without a jacket and wearing a shirt with a hole at\r\nthe elbow.[C4-479] On the other hand, Whaley identified Commission\r\nExhibit No. 150 (the shirt taken from Oswald upon arrest) as the shirt\r\nhis passenger was wearing.[C4-480] He also stated he saw a silver\r\nidentification bracelet on his passenger’s left wrist.[C4-481] Oswald\r\nwas wearing such a bracelet when he was arrested.[C4-482]\r\n\r\nOn November 22, Oswald told Captain Fritz that he rode a bus to a stop\r\nnear his home and then walked to his roominghouse.[C4-483] When queried\r\nthe following morning concerning a bus transfer found in his possession\r\nat the time of his arrest, he admitted receiving it.[C4-484] And when\r\ninterrogated about a cab ride, Oswald also admitted that he left the\r\nslow-moving bus and took a cab to his roominghouse.[C4-485]\r\n\r\nThe Greyhound Bus Station at Lamar and Jackson Streets, where Oswald\r\nentered Whaley’s cab, is three to four short blocks south of Lamar and\r\nElm.[C4-486] If Oswald left the bus at 12:44 p.m. and walked directly\r\nto the terminal, he would have entered the cab at 12:47 or 12:48 p.m.\r\nIf the cab ride was approximately 6 minutes, as was the reconstructed\r\nride, he would have reached his destination at approximately 12:54\r\np.m. If he was discharged at Neely and Beckley and walked directly to\r\nhis roominghouse, he would have arrived there about 12:59 to 1 p.m.\r\nFrom the 500 block of North Beckley, the walk would be a few minutes\r\nlonger, but in either event he would have been in the roominghouse at\r\nabout 1 p.m. This is the approximate time he entered the roominghouse,\r\naccording to Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper there.[C4-487] (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1119-A, p. 158.)\r\n\r\n_Arrival and departure from roominghouse._--Earlene Roberts,\r\nhousekeeper for Mrs. A.C. Johnson at 1026 North Beckley, knew Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald under the alias of O. H. Lee. She first saw him the day\r\nhe rented a room at that address on October 14, 1963.[C4-488] He signed\r\nhis name as O. H. Lee on the roominghouse register.[C4-489]\r\n\r\nMrs. Roberts testified that on Thursday, November 21, Oswald did not\r\ncome home. On Friday, November 22, about 1 p.m., he entered the house\r\nin unusual haste. She recalled that it was subsequent to the time\r\nthe President had been shot. After a friend had called and told her,\r\n“President Kennedy has been shot,” she turned on the television. When\r\nOswald came in she said, “Oh, you are in a hurry,” but Oswald did\r\nnot respond. He hurried to his room and stayed no longer than 3 or 4\r\nminutes. Oswald had entered the house in his shirt sleeves, but when he\r\nleft, he was zipping up a jacket. Mrs. Roberts saw him a few seconds\r\nlater standing near the bus stop in front of the house on the east side\r\nof Beckley.[C4-490]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1968\r\n\r\nLOCATION OF EYEWITNESSES TO THE MOVEMENTS OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD IN THE\r\nVICINITY OF THE TIPPIT KILLING]\r\n\r\nOswald was next seen about nine-tenths of a mile away at the southeast\r\ncorner of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, moments before the Tippit\r\nshooting. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1119-A, p. 158.) If Oswald left\r\nhis roominghouse shortly after 1 p.m. and walked at a brisk pace, he\r\nwould have reached 10th and Patton shortly after 1:15 p.m.[C4-491]\r\nTippit’s murder was recorded on the police radio tape at about 1:16\r\np.m.[C4-492]\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of Shooting\r\n\r\nPatrolman J. D. Tippit joined the Dallas Police Department in July\r\n1952.[C4-493] He was described by Chief Curry as having the reputation\r\nof being “a very fine, dedicated officer.”[C4-494] Tippit patroled\r\ndistrict No. 78 in the Oak Cliff area of Dallas during daylight\r\nhours. He drove a police car painted distinctive colors with No. 10\r\nprominently displayed on each side. Tippit rode alone, as only one\r\nman was normally assigned to a patrol car in residential areas during\r\ndaylight shifts.[C4-495]\r\n\r\nAt about 12:44 p.m. on November 22, the radio dispatcher on channel 1\r\nordered all downtown patrol squads to report to Elm and Houston, code\r\n3 (emergency).[C4-496] At 12:45 p.m. the dispatcher ordered No. 78\r\n(Tippit) to “move into central Oak Cliff area.”[C4-497] At 12:54 p.m.,\r\nTippit reported that he was in the central Oak Cliff area at Lancaster\r\nand Eighth. The dispatcher ordered Tippit to be: “* * * at large for\r\nany emergency that comes in.”[C4-498] According to Chief Curry, Tippit\r\nwas free to patrol the central Oak Cliff area.[C4-499] Tippit must\r\nhave heard the description of the suspect wanted for the President’s\r\nshooting; it was broadcast over channel 1 at 12:45 p.m., again at 12:48\r\np.m., and again at 12:55 p.m.[C4-500] The suspect was described as a\r\n“white male, approximately 30, slender build, height 5 foot 10 inches,\r\nweight 165 pounds.”[C4-501] A similar description was given on channel\r\n2 at 12:45 p.m.[C4-502]\r\n\r\nAt approximately 1:15 p.m., Tippit, who was cruising east on 10th\r\nStreet, passed the intersection of 10th and Patton, about eight blocks\r\nfrom where he had reported at 12:54 p.m. About 100 feet past the\r\nintersection Tippit stopped a man walking east along the south side of\r\nPatton. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, p. 164.) The man’s general\r\ndescription was similar to the one broadcast over the police radio.\r\nTippit stopped the man and called him to his car. He approached the\r\ncar and apparently exchanged words with Tippit through the right front\r\nor vent window. Tippit got out and started to walk around the front of\r\nthe car. As Tippit reached the left front wheel the man pulled out a\r\nrevolver and fired several shots. Four bullets hit Tippit and killed\r\nhim instantly. The gunman started back toward Patton Avenue, ejecting\r\nthe empty cartridge cases before reloading with fresh bullets.\r\n\r\n\r\nEyewitnesses\r\n\r\nAt least 12 persons saw the man with the revolver in the vicinity of\r\nthe Tippit crime scene at or immediately after the shooting. By the\r\nevening of November 22, five of them had identified Lee Harvey Oswald\r\nin police lineups as the man they saw. A sixth did so the next day.\r\nThree others subsequently identified Oswald from a photograph. Two\r\nwitnesses testified that Oswald resembled the man they had seen. One\r\nwitness felt he was too distant from the gunman to make a positive\r\nidentification. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, p. 164.)\r\n\r\nA taxi driver, William Scoggins, was eating lunch in his cab which\r\nwas parked on Patton facing the southeast corner of 10th Street and\r\nPatton Avenue a few feet to the north.[C4-503] A police car moving\r\neast on 10th at about 10 or 12 miles an hour passed in front of his\r\ncab. About 100 feet from the corner the police car pulled up alongside\r\na man on the sidewalk. This man, dressed in a light-colored jacket,\r\napproached the car. Scoggins lost sight of him behind some shrubbery\r\non the southeast corner lot, but he saw the policeman leave the car,\r\nheard three or four shots, and then saw the policeman fall. Scoggins\r\nhurriedly left his seat and hid behind the cab as the man came back\r\ntoward the corner with gun in hand. The man cut across the yard through\r\nsome bushes, passed within 12 feet of Scoggins, and ran south on\r\nPatton. Scoggins saw him and heard him mutter either “Poor damn cop”\r\nor “Poor dumb cop.”[C4-504] The next day Scoggins viewed a lineup of\r\nfour persons and identified Oswald as the man whom he had seen the\r\nday before at 10th and Patton.[C4-505] In his testimony before the\r\nCommission, Scoggins stated that he thought he had seen a picture\r\nof Oswald in the newspapers prior to the lineup identification on\r\nSaturday. He had not seen Oswald on television and had not been shown\r\nany photographs of Oswald by the police.[C4-506]\r\n\r\nAnother witness, Domingo Benavides, was driving a pickup truck west on\r\n10th Street. As he crossed the intersection a block east of 10th and\r\nPatton, he saw a policeman standing by the left door of the police car\r\nparked along the south side of 10th. Benavides saw a man standing at\r\nthe right side of the parked police car. He then heard three shots and\r\nsaw the policeman fall to the ground. By this time the pickup truck\r\nwas across the street and about 25 feet from the police car. Benavides\r\nstopped and waited in the truck until the gunman ran to the corner.\r\nHe saw him empty the gun and throw the shells into some bushes on the\r\nsoutheast corner lot.[C4-507] It was Benavides, using Tippit’s car\r\nradio, who first reported the killing of Patrolman Tippit at about\r\n1:16 p.m.: “We’ve had a shooting out here.”[C4-508] He found two empty\r\nshells in the bushes and gave them to Patrolman J. M. Poe who arrived\r\non the scene shortly after the shooting.[C4-509] Benavides never saw\r\nOswald after the arrest. When questioned by police officers on the\r\nevening of November 22, Benavides told them that he did not think that\r\nhe could identify the man who fired the shots. As a result, they did\r\nnot take him to the police station. He testified that the picture of\r\nOswald which he saw later on television bore a resemblance to the man\r\nwho shot Officer Tippit.[C4-510]\r\n\r\nJust prior to the shooting, Mrs. Helen Markham, a waitress in\r\ndowntown Dallas, was about to cross 10th Street at Patton. As she\r\nwaited on the northwest corner of the intersection for traffic to\r\npass,[C4-511] she noticed a young man as he was “almost ready to get\r\nup on the curb”[C4-512] at the southeast corner of the intersection,\r\napproximately 50 feet away. The man continued along 10th Street. Mrs.\r\nMarkham saw a police car slowly approach the man from the rear and\r\nstop alongside of him. She saw the man come to the right window of the\r\npolice car. As he talked, he leaned on the ledge of the right window\r\nwith his arms. The man appeared to step back as the policeman “calmly\r\nopened the car door” and very slowly got out and walked toward the\r\nfront of the car. The man pulled a gun. Mrs. Markham heard three shots\r\nand saw the policeman fall to the ground near the left front wheel. She\r\nraised her hands to her eyes as the man started to walk back toward\r\nPatton.[C4-513] She peered through her fingers, lowered her hands, and\r\nsaw the man doing something with his gun. “He was just fooling with it.\r\nI didn’t know what he was doing. I was afraid he was fixing to kill\r\nme.”[C4-514] The man “in kind of a little trot” headed down Patton\r\ntoward Jefferson Boulevard, a block away. Mrs. Markham then ran to\r\nOfficer Tippit’s side and saw him lying in a pool of blood.[C4-515]\r\n\r\nHelen Markham was screaming as she leaned over the body.[C4-516] A\r\nfew minutes later she described the gunman to a policeman.[C4-517]\r\nHer description and that of other eyewitnesses led to the police\r\nbroadcast at 1:22 p.m. describing the slayer as “about 30, 5’8”,\r\nblack hair, slender.”[C4-518] At about 4:30 p.m., Mrs. Markham, who\r\nhad been greatly upset by her experience, was able to view a lineup\r\nof four men handcuffed together at the police station.[C4-519] She\r\nidentified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man who shot the policeman.[C4-520]\r\nDetective L. C. Graves, who had been with Mrs. Markham before the\r\nlineup testified that she was “quite hysterical” and was “crying\r\nand upset.”[C4-521] He said that Mrs. Markham started crying when\r\nOswald walked into the lineup room.[C4-522] In testimony before the\r\nCommission, Mrs. Markham confirmed her positive identification of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald as the man she saw kill Officer Tippit.[C4-523]\r\n\r\nIn evaluating Mrs. Markham’s identification of Oswald, the Commission\r\nconsidered certain allegations that Mrs. Markham described the man\r\nwho killed Patrolman Tippit as “short, a little on the heavy side,”\r\nand having “somewhat bushy” hair.[C4-524] The Commission reviewed the\r\ntranscript of a phone conversation in which Mrs. Markham is alleged\r\nto have provided such a description.[C4-525] A review of the complete\r\ntranscript has satisfied the Commission that Mrs. Markham strongly\r\nreaffirmed her positive identification of Oswald and denied having\r\ndescribed the killer as short, stocky and having bushy hair. She\r\nstated that the man weighed about 150 pounds.[C4-526] Although she\r\nused the words “a little bit bushy” to describe the gunman’s hair,\r\nthe transcript establishes that she was referring to the uncombed\r\nstate of his hair, a description fully supported by a photograph of\r\nOswald taken at the time of his arrest. (See Pizzo Exhibit No. 453-C,\r\np. 177.) Although in the phone conversation she described the man as\r\n“short,”[C4-527] on November 22, within minutes of the shooting and\r\nbefore the lineup, Mrs. Markham described the man to the police as 5’8”\r\ntall.[C4-528]\r\n\r\nDuring her testimony Mrs. Markham initially denied that she ever had\r\nthe above phone conversation.[C4-529] She has subsequently admitted\r\nthe existence of the conversation and offered an explanation for her\r\ndenial.[C4-530] Addressing itself solely to the probative value of Mrs.\r\nMarkham’s contemporaneous description of the gunman and her positive\r\nidentification of Oswald at a police lineup, the Commission considers\r\nher testimony reliable. However, even in the absence of Mrs. Markham’s\r\ntestimony, there is ample evidence to identify Oswald as the killer of\r\nTippit.\r\n\r\nTwo young women, Barbara Jeanette Davis and Virginia Davis, were in an\r\napartment of a multiple-unit house on the southeast corner of 10th and\r\nPatton when they heard the sound of gunfire and the screams of Helen\r\nMarkham. They ran to the door in time to see a man with a revolver\r\ncut across their lawn and disappear around a corner of the house onto\r\nPatton.[C4-531] Barbara Jeanette Davis assumed that he was emptying his\r\ngun as “he had it open and was shaking it.”[C4-532] She immediately\r\ncalled the police. Later in the day each woman found an empty shell\r\non the ground near the house. These two shells were delivered to the\r\npolice.[C4-533]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of November 22, Barbara Jeanette and Virginia Davis\r\nviewed a group of four men in a lineup and each one picked Oswald as\r\nthe man who crossed their lawn while emptying his pistol.[C4-534]\r\nBarbara Jeanette Davis testified that no one had shown her a picture\r\nof Oswald before the identification and that she had not seen him\r\non television. She was not sure whether she had seen his picture in\r\na newspaper on the afternoon or evening of November 22 prior to the\r\nlineup.[C4-535] Her reaction when she saw Oswald in the lineup was that\r\n“I was pretty sure it was the same man I saw. When they made him turn\r\nsideways, I was positive that was the one I seen.”[C4-536] Similarly,\r\nVirginia Davis had not been shown pictures of anyone prior to the\r\nlineup and had not seen either television or the newspapers during the\r\nafternoon.[C4-537] She identified Oswald, who was the No. 2 man in the\r\nlineup,[C4-538] as the man she saw running with the gun: she testified,\r\n“I would say that was him for sure.”[C4-539] Barbara Jeanette Davis\r\nand Virginia Davis were sitting alongside each other when they made\r\ntheir positive identifications of Oswald.[C4-540] Each woman whispered\r\nOswald’s number to the detective. Each testified that she was the first\r\nto make the identification.[C4-541]\r\n\r\nWilliam Arthur Smith was about a block east of 10th and Patton when\r\nhe heard shots. He looked west on 10th and saw a man running to the\r\nwest and a policeman falling to the ground. Smith failed to make\r\nhimself known to the police on November 22. Several days later he\r\nreported what he had seen and was questioned by FBI agents.[C4-542]\r\nSmith subsequently told a Commission staff member that he saw Oswald\r\non television the night of the murder and thought that Oswald was the\r\nman he had seen running away from the shooting.[C4-543] On television\r\nOswald’s hair looked blond, whereas Smith remembered that the man\r\nwho ran away had hair that was brown or brownish black. Later, the\r\nFBI showed Smith a picture of Oswald. In the picture the hair was\r\nbrown.[C4-544] According to his testimony, Smith told the FBI, “It\r\nlooked more like him than it did on television.” He stated further\r\nthat from “What I saw of him” the man looked like the man in the\r\npicture.[C4-545]\r\n\r\nTwo other important eyewitnesses to Oswald’s flight were Ted Callaway,\r\nmanager of a used-car lot on the northeast corner of Patton Avenue\r\nand Jefferson Boulevard, and Sam Guinyard, a porter at the lot. They\r\nheard the sound of shots to the north of their lot.[C4-546] Callaway\r\nheard five shots, and Guinyard three. Both ran to the sidewalk on the\r\neast side of Patton at a point about a half a block south of 10th.\r\nThey saw a man coming south on Patton with a revolver held high in his\r\nright hand. According to Callaway, the man crossed to the west side\r\nof Patton.[C4-547] From across the street Callaway yelled, “Hey, man,\r\nwhat the hell is going on?” He slowed down, halted, said something,\r\nand then kept on going to the corner, turned right, and continued west\r\non Jefferson.[C4-548] Guinyard claimed that the man ran down the east\r\nside of Patton and passed within 10 feet of him before crossing to the\r\nother side.[C4-549] Guinyard and Callaway ran to 10th and Patton and\r\nfound Tippit lying in the street beside his car.[C4-550] Apparently he\r\nhad reached for his gun; it lay beneath him outside of the holster.\r\nCallaway picked up the gun.[C4-551] He and Scoggins attempted to chase\r\ndown the gunman in Scoggin’s taxicab,[C4-552] but he had disappeared.\r\nEarly in the evening of November 22, Guinyard and Callaway viewed the\r\nsame lineup of four men from which Mrs. Markham had earlier made her\r\nidentification of Lee Harvey Oswald. Both men picked Oswald as the man\r\nwho had run south on Patton with a gun in his hand.[C4-553] Callaway\r\ntold the Commission: “So they brought four men in. I stepped to the\r\nback of the room, so I could kind of see him from the same distance\r\nwhich I had seen him before. And when he came out I knew him.”[C4-554]\r\nGuinyard said, “I told them that was him right there. I pointed him out\r\nright there.”[C4-555] Both Callaway and Guinyard testified that they\r\nhad not been shown any pictures by the police before the lineup.[C4-556]\r\n\r\nThe Dallas Police Department furnished the Commission with pictures\r\nof the men who appeared in the lineups with Oswald,[C4-557] and the\r\nCommission has inquired into general lineup procedures used by the\r\nDallas police as well as the specific procedures in the lineups\r\ninvolving Oswald.[C4-558] The Commission is satisfied that the lineups\r\nwere conducted fairly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 143\r\n\r\nREVOLVER USED IN TIPPIT KILLING]\r\n\r\nAs Oswald ran south on Patton Avenue toward Jefferson Boulevard\r\nhe was moving in the direction of a used-car lot located on the\r\nsoutheast corner of this intersection.[C4-559] Four men--Warren\r\nReynolds,[C4-560] Harold Russell,[C4-561] Pat Patterson,[C4-562] and\r\nL. J. Lewis[C4-563]--were on the lot at the time, and they saw a white\r\nmale with a revolver in his hands running south on Patton. When the\r\nman reached Jefferson, he turned right and headed west. Reynolds and\r\nPatterson decided to follow him. When he reached a gasoline service\r\nstation one block away he turned north and walked toward a parking\r\narea in the rear of the station. Neither Reynolds nor Patterson saw\r\nthe man after he turned off Jefferson at the service station.[C4-564]\r\nThese four witnesses were interviewed by FBI agents 2 months after\r\nthe shooting. Russell and Patterson were shown a picture of Oswald\r\nand they stated that Oswald was the man they saw on November 22,\r\n1963. Russell confirmed this statement in a sworn affidavit for\r\nthe Commission.[C4-565] Patterson, when asked later to confirm his\r\nidentification by affidavit said he did not recall having been shown\r\nthe photograph. He was then shown two photographs of Oswald and he\r\nadvised that Oswald was “unquestionably” the man he saw.[C4-566]\r\nReynolds did not make a positive identification when interviewed by the\r\nFBI, but he subsequently testified before a Commission staff member\r\nand, when shown two photographs of Oswald, stated that they were\r\nphotographs of the man he saw.[C4-567] L. J. Lewis said in an interview\r\nthat because of the distance from which he observed the gunman he would\r\nhesitate to state whether the man was identical with Oswald.[C4-568]\r\n\r\n\r\nMurder Weapon\r\n\r\nWhen Oswald was arrested, he had in his possession a Smith & Wesson\r\n.38 Special caliber revolver, serial number V510210. (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 143, p. 170). Two of the arresting officers placed their\r\ninitials on the weapon and a third inscribed his name. All three\r\nidentified Exhibit No. 143 as the revolver taken from Oswald when he\r\nwas arrested.[C4-569] Four cartridge cases were found in the shrubbery\r\non the corner of 10th and Patton by three of the eyewitnesses--Domingo\r\nBenavides, Barbara Jeanette Davis, and Virginia Davis.[C4-570] It was\r\nthe unanimous and unequivocal testimony of expert witnesses before the\r\nCommission that these used cartridge cases were fired from the revolver\r\nin Oswald’s possession to the exclusion of all other weapons. (See app.\r\nX, p. 559.)\r\n\r\nCortlandt Cunningham, of the Firearms Identification Unit of the\r\nFBI Laboratory, testified that he compared the four empty cartridge\r\ncases found near the scene of the shooting with a test cartridge\r\nfired from the weapon in Oswald’s possession when he was arrested.\r\nCunningham declared that this weapon fired the four cartridges to the\r\nexclusion of all other weapons. Identification was effected through\r\nbreech face marks and firing pin marks.[C4-571] Robert A. Frazier and\r\nCharles Killion, other FBI firearms experts, independently examined\r\nthe four cartridge cases and arrived at the same conclusion as\r\nCunningham.[C4-572] At the request of the Commission, Joseph D. Nicol,\r\nsuperintendent of the Illinois Bureau of Criminal Identification\r\nInvestigation, also examined the four cartridge cases found near the\r\nsite of the homicide and compared them with the test cartridge cases\r\nfired from the Smith & Wesson revolver taken from Oswald. He concluded\r\nthat all of these cartridges were fired from the same weapon.[C4-573]\r\n\r\nCunningham compared four lead bullets recovered from the body\r\nof Patrolman Tippit with test bullets fired from Oswald’s\r\nrevolver.[C4-574] He explained that the bullets were slightly smaller\r\nthan the barrel of the pistol which had fired them. This caused the\r\nbullets to have an erratic passage through the barrel and impressed\r\nupon the lead of the bullets inconsistent individual characteristics\r\nwhich made identification impossible. Consecutive bullets fired from\r\nthe revolver by the FBI experts could not be identified as having been\r\nfired from that revolver.[C4-575] (See app. X, p. 559.) Cunningham\r\ntestified that all of the bullets were mutilated, one being useless\r\nfor comparison purposes. All four bullets were fired from a weapon\r\nwith five lands and grooves and a right twist[C4-576] which were\r\nthe rifling characteristics of the revolver taken from Oswald. He\r\nconcluded, however, that he could not say whether the four bullets\r\nwere fired from the revolver in Oswald’s possession.[C4-577] “The only\r\nthing I can testify is they could have on the basis of the rifling\r\ncharacteristics--they could have been.”[C4-578]\r\n\r\nNicol differed with the FBI experts on one bullet taken from Tippit’s\r\nbody. He declared that this bullet[C4-579] was fired from the same\r\nweapon that fired the test bullets to the exclusion of all other\r\nweapons. But he agreed that because the other three bullets were\r\nmutilated, he could not determine if they had been fired from the same\r\nweapon as the test bullets.[C4-580]\r\n\r\nThe examination and testimony of the experts enabled the Commission to\r\nconclude that five shots may have been fired, even though only four\r\nbullets were recovered. Three of the bullets recovered from Tippit’s\r\nbody were manufactured by Winchester-Western, and the fourth bullet\r\nby Remington-Peters, but only two of the four discarded cartridge\r\ncases found on the lawn at 10th Street and Patton Avenue were of\r\nWinchester-Western manufacture.[C4-581] Therefore, one cartridge\r\ncase of this type was not recovered. And though only one bullet of\r\nRemington-Peters manufacture was recovered, two empty cartridge\r\ncases of that make were retrieved. Therefore, either one bullet of\r\nRemington-Peters manufacture is missing or one used Remington-Peters\r\ncartridge case, which may have been in the revolver before the\r\nshooting, was discarded along with the others as Oswald left the scene.\r\nIf a bullet is missing, five were fired. This corresponds with the\r\nobservation and memory of Ted Callaway,[C4-582] and possibly Warren\r\nReynolds, but not with the other eyewitnesses who claim to have heard\r\nfrom two to four shots.\r\n\r\n\r\nOwnership of Revolver\r\n\r\nBy checking certain importers and dealers after the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy and slaying of Officer Tippit, agents of the\r\nFBI determined that George Rose & Co. of Los Angeles was a major\r\ndistributor of this type of revolver.[C4-583] Records of Seaport\r\nTraders, Inc., a mail-order division of George Rose & Co., disclosed\r\nthat on January 3, 1963, the company received from Empire Wholesale\r\nSporting Goods, Ltd., Montreal, a shipment of 99 guns in one case.\r\nAmong these guns was a .38 Special caliber Smith & Wesson revolver,\r\nserial No. V510210, the only revolver made by Smith & Wesson with\r\nthis serial number.[C4-584] When first manufactured, it had a 5-inch\r\nbarrel. George Rose & Co. had the barrel shortened by a gunsmith to 2¼\r\ninches.[C4-585]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REVOLVER PURCHASE AND SHIPPING DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 790\r\n\r\nMICHAELIS EXHIBIT NO. 2\r\n\r\nMICHAELIS EXHIBIT NO. 4\r\n\r\nMICHAELIS EXHIBIT NO. 5]\r\n\r\nSometime after January 27, 1963, Seaport Traders, Inc., received\r\nthrough the mail a mail-order coupon for one “.38 St. W. 2” Bbl.,” cost\r\n$29.95. Ten dollars in cash was enclosed. The order was signed in ink\r\nby “A. J. Hidell, aged 28.”[C4-586] (See Commission Exhibit No. 790,\r\np. 173.) The date of the order was January 27 (no year shown), and the\r\nreturn address was Post Office Box 2915, Dallas, Tex. Also on the order\r\nform was an order, written in ink, for one box of ammunition and one\r\nholster, but a line was drawn through these items. The mail-order form\r\nhad a line for the name of a witness to attest that the person ordering\r\nthe gun was a U.S. citizen and had not been convicted of a felony. The\r\nname written in this space was D. F. Drittal.[C4-587]\r\n\r\nHeinz W. Michaelis, office manager of both George Rose & Co., Inc., and\r\nSeaport Traders, Inc., identified records of Seaport Traders, Inc.,\r\nwhich showed that a “.38 S and W Special two-inch Commando, serial\r\nnumber V510210” was shipped on March 20, 1963, to A. J. Hidell, Post\r\nOffice Box 2915, Dallas, Tex. The invoice was prepared on March 13,\r\n1963; the revolver was actually shipped on March 20 by Railway Express.\r\nThe balance due on the purchase was $19.95. Michaelis furnished the\r\nshipping copy of the invoice, and the Railway Express Agency shipping\r\ndocuments, showing that $19.95, plus $1.27 shipping charge, had been\r\ncollected from the consignee, Hidell.[C4-588] (See Michaelis Exhibits\r\nNos. 2, 4, 5, p. 173.)\r\n\r\nHandwriting experts, Alwyn Cole of the Treasury Department and James\r\nC. Cadigan of the FBI, testified before the Commission that the\r\nwriting on the coupon was Oswald’s. The signature of the witness,\r\nD. F. Drittal, who attested that the fictitious Hidell was an American\r\ncitizen and had not been convicted of a felony, was also in Oswald’s\r\nhandwriting.[C4-589] Marina Oswald gave as her opinion that the\r\nmail-order coupon was in Oswald’s handwriting.[C4-590] When shown\r\nthe revolver, she stated that she recognized it as the one owned by\r\nher husband.[C4-591] She also testified that this appeared to be\r\nthe revolver seen in Oswald’s belt in the picture she took in late\r\nMarch or early April 1963 when the family was living on Neely Street\r\nin Dallas.[C4-592] Police found an empty revolver holster when they\r\nsearched Oswald’s room on Beckley Avenue after his arrest.[C4-593]\r\nMarina Oswald testified that this was the holster which contained the\r\nrevolver in the photographs taken on Neely Street.[C4-594]\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald’s Jacket\r\n\r\nApproximately 15 minutes before the shooting of Tippit, Oswald was\r\nseen leaving his roominghouse.[C4-595] He was wearing a zipper\r\njacket which he had not been wearing moments before when he had\r\narrived home.[C4-596] When Oswald was arrested, he did not have a\r\njacket.[C4-597] Shortly after Tippit was slain, policemen found a\r\nlight-colored zipper jacket along the route taken by the killer as he\r\nattempted to escape.[C4-598] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, p. 164.)\r\n\r\nAt 1:22 p.m. the Dallas police radio described the man wanted for the\r\nmurder of Tippit as “a white male about thirty, five foot eight inches,\r\nblack hair, slender, wearing a white jacket, white shirt and dark\r\nslacks.”[C4-599] According to Patrolman Poe this description came from\r\nMrs. Markham and Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis.[C4-600] Mrs. Markham told\r\nPoe that the man was a “white male, about 25, about five feet eight,\r\nbrown hair, medium,” and wearing a “white jacket.” Mrs. Davis gave Poe\r\nthe same general description: a “white male in his early twenties,\r\naround five foot seven inches or eight inches, about 145 pounds,” and\r\nwearing a white jacket.\r\n\r\nAs has been discussed previously, two witnesses, Warren Reynolds and\r\nB. M. Patterson, saw the gunman run toward the rear of a gasoline\r\nservice station on Jefferson Boulevard. Mrs. Mary Brock, the wife of a\r\nmechanic who worked at the station, was there at the time and she saw\r\na white male, “5 feet, 10 inches * * * wearing light clothing * * * a\r\nlight-colored jacket” walk past her at a fast pace with his hands in\r\nhis pocket. She last saw him in the parking lot directly behind the\r\nservice station. When interviewed by FBI agents on January 21, 1964,\r\nshe identified a picture of Oswald as being the same person she saw on\r\nNovember 22. She confirmed this interview by a sworn affidavit.[C4-601]\r\n\r\nAt 1:24 p.m., the police radio reported, “The suspect last seen running\r\nwest on Jefferson from 400 East Jefferson.”[C4-602] Police Capt. W. R.\r\nWestbrook and several other officers concentrated their search along\r\nJefferson Boulevard.[C4-603] Westbrook walked through the parking lot\r\nbehind the service station[C4-604] and found a light-colored jacket\r\nlying under the rear of one of the cars.[C4-605] Westbrook identified\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 162 as the light-colored jacket which he\r\ndiscovered underneath the automobile.[C4-606]\r\n\r\nThis jacket belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald. Marina Oswald stated\r\nthat her husband owned only two jackets, one blue and the other\r\ngray.[C4-607] The blue jacket was found in the Texas School Book\r\nDepository[C4-608] and was identified by Marina Oswald as her\r\nhusband’s.[C4-609] Marina Oswald also identified Commission Exhibit No.\r\n162, the jacket found by Captain Westbrook, as her husband’s second\r\njacket.[C4-610]\r\n\r\nThe eyewitnesses vary in their identification of the jacket. Mrs.\r\nEarlene Roberts, the housekeeper at Oswald’s roominghouse and the last\r\nperson known to have seen him before he reached 10th Street and Patton\r\nAvenue, said that she may have seen the gray zipper jacket but she was\r\nnot certain. It seemed to her that the jacket Oswald wore was darker\r\nthan Commission Exhibit No. 162.[C4-611] Ted Callaway, who saw the\r\ngunman moments after the shooting, testified that Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 162 looked like the jacket he was wearing but “I thought it had a\r\nlittle more tan to it.”[C4-612] Two other witnesses, Sam Guinyard and\r\nWilliam Arthur Smith, testified that Commission Exhibit No. 162 was\r\nthe jacket worn by the man they saw on November 22. Mrs. Markham and\r\nBarbara Davis thought that the jacket worn by the slayer of Tippit was\r\ndarker than the jacket found by Westbrook.[C4-613] Scoggins thought it\r\nwas lighter.[C4-614]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, however, that Oswald was seen leaving his\r\nroominghouse at about 1 p.m. wearing a zipper jacket, that the man who\r\nkilled Tippit was wearing a light-colored jacket, that he was seen\r\nrunning along Jefferson Boulevard, that a jacket was found under a car\r\nin a lot adjoining Jefferson Boulevard, that the jacket belonged to\r\nLee Harvey Oswald, and that when he was arrested at approximately 1:50\r\np.m., he was in shirt sleeves. These facts warrant the finding that Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald disposed of his jacket as he fled from the scene of the\r\nTippit killing.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThe foregoing evidence establishes that (1) two eyewitnesses who heard\r\nthe shots and saw the shooting of Dallas Police Patrolman J. D. Tippit\r\nand seven eyewitnesses who saw the flight of the gunman with revolver\r\nin hand positively identified Lee Harvey Oswald as the man they saw\r\nfire the shots or flee from the scene, (2) the cartridge cases found\r\nnear the scene of the shooting were fired from the revolver in the\r\npossession of Oswald at the time of his arrest, to the exclusion of all\r\nother weapons, (3) the revolver in Oswald’s possession at the time of\r\nhis arrest was purchased by and belonged to Oswald, and (4) Oswald’s\r\njacket was found along the path of flight taken by the gunman as he\r\nfled from the scene of the killing. On the basis of this evidence\r\nthe Commission concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Dallas Police\r\nPatrolman J.D. Tippit.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSWALD’S ARREST\r\n\r\nThe Texas Theatre is on the north side of Jefferson Boulevard,\r\napproximately eight blocks from the scene of the Tippit shooting and\r\nsix blocks from where several witnesses last saw Oswald running west on\r\nJefferson Boulevard.[C4-615] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1968, p. 164.)\r\nShortly after the Tippit murder, police sirens sounded along Jefferson\r\nBoulevard. One of the persons who heard the sirens was Johnny Calvin\r\nBrewer, manager of Hardy’s Shoestore, a few doors east of the Texas\r\nTheatre. Brewer knew from radio broadcasts that the President had been\r\nshot and that a patrolman had also been shot in Oak Cliff.[C4-616]\r\nWhen he heard police sirens, he “looked up and saw the man enter the\r\nlobby,” a recessed area extending about 15 feet between the sidewalk\r\nand the front door of his store.[C4-617] A police car made a =U=-turn,\r\nand as the sirens grew fainter, the man in the lobby “looked over his\r\nshoulder and turned around and walked up West Jefferson towards the\r\ntheatre.”[C4-618] The man wore a T-shirt beneath his outer shirt and he\r\nhad no jacket.[C4-619] Brewer said, “He just looked funny to me. * * *\r\nHis hair was sort of messed up and looked like he had been running, and\r\nhe looked scared, and he looked funny.”[C4-620]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (HILL EXHIBIT B) OSWALD IN FRONT OF TEXAS THEATER\r\n\r\n(FRANK PIZZO EXHIBIT 453-C)\r\n\r\nOSWALD AT DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1797\r\n\r\nOSWALD AT DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT]\r\n\r\nMrs. Julia Postal, selling tickets at the box office of the Texas\r\nTheatre, heard police sirens and then saw a man as he “ducked into”\r\nthe outer lobby space of the theatre near the ticket office.[C4-621]\r\nAttracted by the sound of the sirens, Mrs. Postal stepped out of the\r\nbox office and walked to the curb.[C4-622] Shortly thereafter, Johnny\r\nBrewer, who had come from the nearby shoestore, asked Mrs. Postal\r\nwhether the fellow that had ducked in had bought a ticket.[C4-623] She\r\nsaid, “No; by golly, he didn’t,” and turned around, but the man was\r\nnowhere in sight.[C4-624] Brewer told Mrs. Postal that he had seen the\r\nman ducking into his place of business and that he had followed him\r\nto the theatre.[C4-625] She sent Brewer into the theatre to find the\r\nman and check the exits, told him about the assassination, and said “I\r\ndon’t know if this is the man they want * * * but he is running from\r\nthem for some reason.”[C4-626] She then called the police.[C4-627]\r\n\r\nAt 1:45 p.m., the police radio stated, “Have information a suspect\r\njust went in the Texas Theatre on West Jefferson.”[C4-628] Patrol cars\r\nbearing at least 15 officers converged on the Texas Theatre.[C4-629]\r\nPatrolman M. N. McDonald, with Patrolmen R. Hawkins, T. A. Hutson,\r\nand C. T. Walker, entered the theatre from the rear.[C4-630] Other\r\npolicemen entered the front door and searched the balcony.[C4-631]\r\nDetective Paul L. Bentley rushed to the balcony and told the\r\nprojectionist to turn up the house lights.[C4-632] Brewer met McDonald\r\nand the other policemen at the alley exit door, stepped out onto the\r\nstage with them[C4-633] and pointed out the man who had come into the\r\ntheatre without paying.[C4-634] The man was Oswald. He was sitting\r\nalone in the rear of the main floor of the theatre near the right\r\ncenter aisle.[C4-635] About six or seven people were seated on the\r\ntheatre’s main floor and an equal number in the balcony.[C4-636]\r\n\r\nMcDonald first searched two men in the center of the main floor,\r\nabout 10 rows from the front.[C4-637] He walked out of the row up\r\nthe right center aisle.[C4-638] When he reached the row where the\r\nsuspect was sitting, McDonald stopped abruptly and told the man to\r\nget on his feet.[C4-639] Oswald rose from his seat, bringing up both\r\nhands.[C4-640] As McDonald started to search Oswald’s waist for a\r\ngun, he heard him say, “Well, it’s all over now.”[C4-641] Oswald then\r\nstruck McDonald between the eyes with his left fist; with his right\r\nhand he drew a gun from his waist.[C4-642] McDonald struck back with\r\nhis right hand and grabbed the gun with his left hand.[C4-643] They\r\nboth fell into the seats.[C4-644] Three other officers, moving toward\r\nthe scuffle, grabbed Oswald from the front, rear and side.[C4-645] As\r\nMcDonald fell into the seat with his left hand on the gun, he felt\r\nsomething graze across his hand and heard what sounded like the snap of\r\nthe hammer.[C4-646] McDonald felt the pistol scratch his cheek as he\r\nwrenched it away from Oswald.[C4-647] Detective Bob K. Carroll, who was\r\nstanding beside McDonald, seized the gun from him.[C4-648]\r\n\r\nThe other officers who helped subdue Oswald corroborated McDonald in\r\nhis testimony except that they did not hear Oswald say, “It’s all\r\nover now.” Deputy Sheriff Eddy R. Walthers recalled such a remark\r\nbut he did not reach the scene of the struggle until Oswald had been\r\nknocked to the floor by McDonald and the others.[C4-649] Some of the\r\nofficers saw Oswald strike McDonald with his fist.[C4-650] Most of them\r\nheard a click which they assumed to be a click of the hammer of the\r\nrevolver.[C4-651] Testimony of a firearms expert before the Commission\r\nestablished that the hammer of the revolver never touched the shell in\r\nthe chamber.[C4-652] Although the witnesses did not hear the sound of\r\na misfire, they might have heard a snapping noise resulting from the\r\npolice officer grabbing the cylinder of the revolver and pulling it\r\naway from Oswald while he was attempting to pull the trigger.[C4-653]\r\n(See app. X, p. 560.)\r\n\r\nTwo patrons of the theatre and John Brewer testified regarding the\r\narrest of Oswald, as did the various police officers who participated\r\nin the fight. George Jefferson Applin, Jr., confirmed that Oswald\r\nfought with four or five officers before he was handcuffed.[C4-654] He\r\nadded that one officer grabbed the muzzle of a shotgun, drew back, and\r\nhit Oswald with the butt end of the gun in the back.[C4-655] No other\r\ntheatre patron or officer has testified that Oswald was hit by a gun.\r\nNor did Oswald ever complain that he was hit with a gun, or injured in\r\nthe back. Deputy Sheriff Walthers brought a shotgun into the theatre\r\nbut laid it on some seats before helping to subdue Oswald.[C4-656]\r\nOfficer Ray Hawkins said that there was no one near Oswald who had a\r\nshotgun and he saw no one strike Oswald in the back with a rifle butt\r\nor the butt of a gun.[C4-657]\r\n\r\nJohn Gibson, another patron in the theatre, saw an officer grab Oswald,\r\nand he claims that he heard the click of a gun misfiring.[C4-658] He\r\nsaw no shotgun in the possession of any policeman near Oswald.[C4-659]\r\nJohnny Brewer testified he saw Oswald pull the revolver and the\r\nofficers struggle with him to take it away but that once he was\r\nsubdued, no officer struck him.[C4-660] He further stated that\r\nwhile fists were flying he heard one of the officers say “Kill the\r\nPresident, will you.”[C4-661] It is unlikely that any of the police\r\nofficers referred to Oswald as a suspect in the assassination. While\r\nthe police radio had noted the similarity in description of the two\r\nsuspects, the arresting officers were pursuing Oswald for the murder\r\nof Tippit.[C4-662] As Oswald, handcuffed, was led from the theatre, he\r\nwas, according to McDonald, “cursing a little bit and hollering police\r\nbrutality.”[C4-663] At 1:51 p.m., police car 2 reported by radio that\r\nit was on the way to headquarters with the suspect.[C4-664]\r\n\r\nCaptain Fritz returned to police headquarters from the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository at 2:15 after a brief stop at the sheriff’s\r\noffice.[C4-665] When he entered the homicide and robbery bureau office,\r\nhe saw two detectives standing there with Sgt. Gerald L. Hill, who had\r\ndriven from the theatre with Oswald.[C4-666] Hill testified that Fritz\r\ntold the detective to get a search warrant, go to an address on Fifth\r\nStreet in Irving, and pick up a man named Lee Oswald. When Hill asked\r\nwhy Oswald was wanted, Fritz replied, “Well, he was employed down at\r\nthe Book Depository and he had not been present for a roll call of the\r\nemployees.”[C4-667] Hill said, “Captain, we will save you a trip * * *\r\nthere he sits.”[C4-668]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATEMENTS OF OSWALD DURING DETENTION\r\n\r\nOswald was questioned intermittently for approximately 12 hours between\r\n2:30 p.m., on November 22, and 11 a.m., on November 24. Throughout\r\nthis interrogation he denied that he had anything to do either with\r\nthe assassination of President Kennedy or the murder of Patrolman\r\nTippit. Captain Fritz of the homicide and robbery bureau did most of\r\nthe questioning, but he kept no notes and there were no stenographic\r\nor tape recordings. Representatives of other law enforcement agencies\r\nwere also present, including the FBI and the U.S. Secret Service. They\r\noccasionally participated in the questioning. The reports prepared by\r\nthose present at these interviews are set forth in appendix XI. A full\r\ndiscussion of Oswald’s detention and interrogation is presented in\r\nchapter V of this report.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening of November 22, the Dallas Police Department\r\nperformed paraffin tests on Oswald’s hands and right cheek in an\r\napparent effort to determine, by means of a scientific test, whether\r\nOswald had recently fired a weapon. The results were positive for\r\nthe hands and negative for the right cheek.[C4-669] Expert testimony\r\nbefore the Commission was to the effect that the paraffin test was\r\nunreliable[C4-670] in determining whether or not a person has fired a\r\nrifle or revolver.[C4-671] The Commission has, therefore, placed no\r\nreliance on the paraffin tests administered by the Dallas police. (See\r\napp. X, pp. 561-562.)\r\n\r\nOswald provided little information during his questioning. Frequently,\r\nhowever, he was confronted with evidence which he could not explain,\r\nand he resorted to statements which are known to be lies.[C4-672] While\r\nOswald’s untrue statements during interrogation were not considered\r\nitems of positive proof by the Commission, they had probative value in\r\ndeciding the weight to be given to his denials that he assassinated\r\nPresident Kennedy and killed Patrolman Tippit. Since independent\r\nevidence revealed that Oswald repeatedly and blatantly lied to the\r\npolice, the Commission gave little weight to his denials of guilt.\r\n\r\n\r\nDenial of Rifle Ownership\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, Oswald denied owning a rifle. On November 23, Fritz\r\nconfronted Oswald with the evidence that he had purchased a rifle under\r\nthe fictitious name of “Hidell.” Oswald said that this was not true.\r\nOswald denied that he had a rifle wrapped up in a blanket in the Paine\r\ngarage. Oswald also denied owning a rifle and said that since leaving\r\nthe Marine Corps he had fired only a small bore .22 rifle.[C4-673] On\r\nthe afternoon of November 23, Officers H. M. Moore, R. S. Stovall, and\r\nG. F. Rose obtained a search warrant and examined Oswald’s effects in\r\nthe Paine garage. They discovered two photographs, each showing Oswald\r\nwith a rifle and a pistol.[C4-674] These photographs were shown to\r\nOswald on the evening of November 23 and again on the morning of the\r\n24th. According to Fritz, Oswald sneered, saying that they were fake\r\nphotographs, that he had been photographed a number of times the day\r\nbefore by the police, that they had superimposed upon the photographs\r\na rifle and a revolver.[C4-675] He told Fritz a number of times that\r\nthe smaller photograph was either made from the larger, or the larger\r\nphotograph was made from the smaller and that at the proper time he\r\nwould show that the pictures were fakes. Fritz told him that the two\r\nsmall photographs were found in the Paine garage. At that point,\r\nOswald refused to answer any further questions.[C4-676] As previously\r\nindicated, Marina Oswald testified that she took the two pictures with\r\nher husband’s Imperial Reflex camera when they lived on Neely Street.\r\nHer testimony was fully supported by a photography expert who testified\r\nthat in his opinion the pictures were not composites.[C4-677]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Revolver\r\n\r\nAt the first interrogation, Oswald claimed that his only crime was\r\ncarrying a gun and resisting arrest. When Captain Fritz asked him why\r\nhe carried the revolver, he answered, “Well, you know about a pistol.\r\nI just carried it.”[C4-678] He falsely alleged that he bought the\r\nrevolver in Fort Worth,[C4-679] when in fact he purchased it from a\r\nmail-order house in Los Angeles.[C4-680]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Aliases “Hidell” and “O. H. Lee”\r\n\r\nThe arresting officers found a forged selective service card with\r\na picture of Oswald and the name “Alek J. Hidell” in Oswald’s\r\nbillfold.[C4-681] On November 22 and 23, Oswald refused to tell Fritz\r\nwhy this card was in his possession,[C4-682] or to answer any questions\r\nconcerning the card.[C4-683] On Sunday morning, November 24, Oswald\r\ndenied that he knew A. J. Hidell. Captain Fritz produced the selective\r\nservice card bearing the name “Alek J. Hidell.” Oswald became angry\r\nand said, “Now, I’ve told you all I’m going to tell you about that\r\ncard in my billfold--you have the card yourself and you know as much\r\nabout it as I do.”[C4-684] At the last interrogation on November 24,\r\nOswald admitted to Postal Inspector Holmes that he had rented post\r\noffice box 2915, Dallas, but denied that he had received a package\r\nin this box addressed to Hidell. He also denied that he had received\r\nthe rifle through this box.[C4-685] Holmes reminded Oswald that A. J.\r\nHidell was listed on post office box 30061, New Orleans, as one\r\nentitled to receive mail. Oswald replied, “I don’t know anything about\r\nthat.”[C4-686]\r\n\r\nWhen asked why he lived at his roominghouse under the name O. H. Lee,\r\nOswald responded that the landlady simply made a mistake, because he\r\ntold her that his name was Lee, meaning his first name.[C4-687] An\r\nexamination of the roominghouse register revealed that Oswald actually\r\nsigned the name O. H. Lee.[C4-688]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Curtain Rod Story\r\n\r\nIn concluding that Oswald was carrying a rifle in the paper bag on the\r\nmorning of November 22, 1963, the Commission found that Oswald lied\r\nwhen he told Frazier that he was returning to Irving to obtain curtain\r\nrods. When asked about the curtain rod story, Oswald lied again. He\r\ndenied that he had ever told Frazier that he wanted a ride to Irving\r\nto get curtain rods for an apartment.[C4-689] He explained that a\r\nparty for the Paine children had been planned for the weekend and he\r\npreferred not to be in the Paine house at that time; therefore, he made\r\nhis weekly visit on Thursday night.[C4-690] Actually, the party for one\r\nof the Paine’s children was the preceding weekend, when Marina Oswald\r\nsuggested that Oswald remain in Dallas.[C4-691] When told that Frazier\r\nand Mrs. Randle had seen him carrying a long heavy package, Oswald\r\nreplied, “Well, they was mistaken. That must have been some other\r\ntime he picked me up.”[C4-692] In one interview, he told Fritz that\r\nthe only sack he carried to work that day was a lunch sack which he\r\nkept on his lap during the ride from Irving to Dallas.[C4-693] Frazier\r\ntestified before the Commission that Oswald carried no lunch sack that\r\nday.[C4-694]\r\n\r\n\r\nActions During and After Shooting\r\n\r\nDuring the first interrogation on November 22, Fritz asked Oswald to\r\naccount for himself at the time the President was shot. Oswald told him\r\nthat he ate lunch in the first-floor lunchroom and then went to the\r\nsecond floor for a Coke which he brought downstairs. He acknowledged\r\nthe encounter with the police officer on the second floor. Oswald\r\ntold Fritz that after lunch he went outside, talked with Foreman Bill\r\nShelley for 5 or 10 minutes and then left for home. He said that he\r\nleft work because Bill Shelley said that there would be no more work\r\ndone that day in the building.[C4-695] Shelley denied seeing Oswald\r\nafter 12 noon or at any time after the shooting.[C4-696] The next day,\r\nOswald added to his story. He stated that at the time the President was\r\nshot he was having lunch with “Junior” but he did not give Junior’s\r\nlast name.[C4-697] The only employee at the Depository Building named\r\n“Junior” was James Jarman, Jr. Jarman testified that he ate his lunch\r\non the first floor around 5 minutes to 12, and that he neither ate\r\nlunch with nor saw Oswald.[C4-698] Jarman did talk to Oswald that\r\nmorning:\r\n\r\n    * * * he asked me what were the people gathering around on the\r\n    corner for and I told him that the President was supposed to\r\n    pass that morning, and he asked me did I know which way he was\r\n    coming, and I told him, yes, he probably come down Main and\r\n    turn on Houston and then back again on Elm. Then he said, “Oh,\r\n    I see,” and that was all.[C4-699]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIOR ATTEMPT TO KILL\r\n\r\nThe Attempt on the Life of Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker\r\n\r\nAt approximately 9 p.m., on April 10, 1963, in Dallas, Tex., Maj. Gen.\r\nEdwin A. Walker, an active and controversial figure on the American\r\npolitical scene since his resignation from the U.S. Army in 1961,\r\nnarrowly escaped death when a rifle bullet fired from outside his\r\nhome passed near his head as he was seated at his desk.[C4-700] There\r\nwere no eyewitnesses, although a 14-year-old boy in a neighboring\r\nhouse claimed that immediately after the shooting he saw two men, in\r\nseparate cars, drive out of a church parking lot adjacent to Walker’s\r\nhome.[C4-701] A friend of Walker’s testified that two nights before the\r\nshooting he saw “two men around the house peeking in windows.”[C4-702]\r\nGeneral Walker gave this information to the police before the shooting,\r\nbut it did not help solve the crime. Although the bullet was recovered\r\nfrom Walker’s house (see app. X, p. 562), in the absence of a weapon\r\nit was of little investigatory value. General Walker hired two\r\ninvestigators to determine whether a former employee might have been\r\ninvolved in the shooting.[C4-703] Their results were negative. Until\r\nDecember 3, 1963, the Walker shooting remained unsolved.\r\n\r\nThe Commission evaluated the following evidence in considering whether\r\nLee Harvey Oswald fired the shot which almost killed General Walker:\r\n(1) A note which Oswald left for his wife on the evening of the\r\nshooting, (2) photographs found among Oswald’s possessions after the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy, (3) firearm identification of the\r\nbullet found in Walker’s home, and (4) admissions and other statements\r\nmade to Marina Oswald by Oswald concerning the shooting.\r\n\r\n_Note left by Oswald._--On December 2, 1963, Mrs. Ruth Paine turned\r\nover to the police some of the Oswalds’ belongings, including a Russian\r\nvolume entitled “Book of Useful Advice.”[C4-704] In this book was an\r\nundated note written in Russian. In translation, the note read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    1. This is the key to the mailbox which is located in the main\r\n    post office in the city on Ervay Street. This is the same\r\n    street where the drugstore, in which you always waited is\r\n    located. You will find the mailbox in the post office which is\r\n    located 4 blocks from the drugstore on that street. I paid for\r\n    the box last month so don’t worry about it.\r\n\r\n    2. Send the information as to what has happened to me to\r\n    the Embassy and include newspaper clippings (should there\r\n    be anything about me in the newspapers). I believe that the\r\n    Embassy will come quickly to your assistance on learning\r\n    everything.\r\n\r\n    3. I paid the house rent on the 2d so don’t worry about it.\r\n\r\n    4. Recently I also paid for water and gas.\r\n\r\n    5. The money from work will possibly be coming. The money will\r\n    be sent to our post office box. Go to the bank and cash the\r\n    check.\r\n\r\n    6. You can either throw out or give my clothing, etc. away.\r\n    Do not keep these. However, I prefer that you hold on to my\r\n    personal papers (military, civil, etc.).\r\n\r\n    7. Certain of my documents are in the small blue valise.\r\n\r\n    8. The address book can be found on my table in the study\r\n    should need same.\r\n\r\n    9. We have friends here. The Red Cross also will help you. (Red\r\n    Cross in English). [sic]\r\n\r\n    10. I left you as much money as I could, $60 on the second of\r\n    the month. You and the baby [apparently] can live for another 2\r\n    months using $10 per week.\r\n\r\n    11. If I am alive and taken prisoner, the city jail is located\r\n    at the end of the bridge through which we always passed on\r\n    going to the city (right in the beginning of the city after\r\n    crossing the bridge).[C4-705]\r\n\r\nJames C. Cadigan, FBI handwriting expert, testified that this note was\r\nwritten by Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-706]\r\n\r\nPrior to the Walker shooting on April 10, Oswald had been attending\r\ntyping classes on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings. He had quit\r\nthese classes at least a week before the shooting, which occurred on\r\na Wednesday night.[C4-707] According to Marina Oswald’s testimony, on\r\nthe night of the Walker shooting, her husband left their apartment on\r\nNeely Street shortly after dinner. She thought he was attending a class\r\nor was “on his own business.”[C4-708] When he failed to return by 10\r\nor 10:30 p.m., Marina Oswald went to his room and discovered the note.\r\nShe testified: “When he came back I asked him what had happened. He was\r\nvery pale. I don’t remember the exact time, but it was very late. And\r\nhe told me not to ask him any questions. He only told me he had shot\r\nat General Walker.”[C4-709] Oswald told his wife that he did not know\r\nwhether he had hit Walker; according to Marina Oswald when he learned\r\non the radio and in the newspapers the next day that he had missed,\r\nhe said that he “was very sorry that he had not hit him.”[C4-710]\r\nMarina Oswald’s testimony was fully supported by the note itself which\r\nappeared to be the work of a man expecting to be killed, or imprisoned,\r\nor to disappear. The last paragraph directed her to the jail and the\r\nother paragraphs instructed her on the disposal of Oswald’s personal\r\neffects and the management of her affairs if he should not return.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the note was written while the Oswalds were living\r\nin Dallas before they moved to New Orleans in the spring of 1963. The\r\nreferences to house rent and payments for water and gas indicated that\r\nthe note was written when they were living in a rented apartment;\r\ntherefore it could not have been written while Marina Oswald was living\r\nwith the Paines. Moreover, the reference in paragraph 3 to paying “the\r\nhouse rent on the 2d” would be consistent with the period when the\r\nOswalds were living on Neely Street since the apartment was rented on\r\nMarch 3, 1963. Oswald had paid the first month’s rent in advance on\r\nMarch 2, 1963, and the second month’s rent was paid on either April\r\n2 or April 3.[C4-711] The main post office “on Ervay Street” refers\r\nto the post office where Oswald rented box 2915 from October 9, 1962,\r\nto May 14, 1963.[C4-712] Another statement which limits the time\r\nwhen it could have been written is the reference “you and the baby,”\r\nwhich would indicate that it was probably written before the birth of\r\nOswald’s second child on October 20, 1963.\r\n\r\nOswald had apparently mistaken the county jail for the city jail.\r\nFrom Neely Street the Oswalds would have traveled downtown on the\r\nBeckley bus, across the Commerce Street viaduct and into downtown\r\nDallas through the Triple Underpass.[C4-713] Either the viaduct or the\r\nunderpass might have been the “bridge” mentioned in the last paragraph\r\nof the note. The county jail is at the corner of Houston and Main\r\nStreets “right in the beginning of the city” after one travels through\r\nthe underpass.\r\n\r\n_Photographs._--In her testimony before the Commission in February\r\n1964, Marina Oswald stated that when Oswald returned home on the\r\nnight of the Walker shooting, he told her that he had been planning\r\nthe attempt for 2 months. He showed her a notebook 3 days later\r\ncontaining photographs of General Walker’s home and a map of the area\r\nwhere the house was located.[C4-714] Although Oswald destroyed the\r\nnotebook,[C4-715] three photographs found among Oswald’s possessions\r\nafter the assassination were identified by Marina Oswald as photographs\r\nof General Walker’s house.[C4-716] Two of these photographs were taken\r\nfrom the rear of Walker’s house.[C4-717] The Commission confirmed, by\r\ncomparison with other photographs, that these were, indeed, photographs\r\nof the rear of Walker’s house.[C4-718] An examination of the window at\r\nthe rear of the house, the wall through which the bullet passed, and\r\nthe fence behind the house indicated that the bullet was fired from a\r\nposition near the point where one of the photographs was taken.[C4-719]\r\n\r\nThe third photograph identified by Marina Oswald depicts the entrance\r\nto General Walker’s driveway from a back alley.[C4-720] Also seen\r\nin the picture is the fence on which Walker’s assailant apparently\r\nrested the rifle.[C4-721] An examination of certain construction work\r\nappearing in the background of this photograph revealed that the\r\npicture was taken between March 8 and 12, 1963, and most probably on\r\neither March 9 or March 10.[C4-722] Oswald purchased the money order\r\nfor the rifle on March 12, the rifle was shipped on March 20,[C4-723]\r\nand the shooting occurred on April 10. A photography expert with\r\nthe FBI was able to determine that this picture was taken with the\r\nImperial Reflex camera owned by Lee Harvey Oswald.[C4-724] (See app. X,\r\np. 596.)\r\n\r\nA fourth photograph, showing a stretch of railroad tracks, was\r\nalso identified by Marina Oswald as having been taken by her\r\nhusband, presumably in connection with the Walker shooting.[C4-725]\r\nInvestigation determined that this photograph was taken approximately\r\nseven-tenths of a mile from Walker’s house.[C4-726] Another photograph\r\nof railroad tracks found among Oswald’s possessions was not identified\r\nby his wife, but investigation revealed that it was taken from a point\r\nslightly less than half a mile from General Walker’s house.[C4-727]\r\nMarina Oswald stated that when she asked her husband what he had done\r\nwith the rifle, he replied that he had buried it in the ground or\r\nhidden it in some bushes and that he also mentioned a railroad track in\r\nthis connection. She testified that several days later Oswald recovered\r\nhis rifle and brought it back to their apartment.[C4-728]\r\n\r\n_Firearms identification._--In the room beyond the one in which General\r\nWalker was sitting on the night of the shooting the Dallas police\r\nrecovered a badly mutilated bullet which had come to rest on a stack of\r\npaper.[C4-729] The Dallas City-County Investigation Laboratory tried to\r\ndetermine the type of weapon which fired the bullet. The oral report\r\nwas negative because of the battered condition of the bullet.[C4-730]\r\nOn November 30, 1963, the FBI requested the bullet for ballistics\r\nexamination; the Dallas Police Department forwarded it on December 2,\r\n1963.[C4-731]\r\n\r\nRobert A. Frazier, an FBI ballistics identification expert, testified\r\nthat he was “unable to reach a conclusion” as to whether or not the\r\nbullet recovered from Walker’s house had been fired from the rifle\r\nfound on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building.\r\nHe concluded that “the general rifling characteristics of the rifle\r\n* * * are of the same type as those found on the bullet * * * and,\r\nfurther, on this basis * * * the bullet could have been fired from the\r\nrifle on the basis of its land and groove impressions.”[C4-732] Frazier\r\ntestified further that the FBI avoids the category of “probable”\r\nidentification. Unless the missile or cartridge case can be identified\r\nas coming from a particular weapon to the exclusion of all others, the\r\nFBI refuses to draw any conclusion as to probability.[C4-733] Frazier\r\ntestified, however, that he found no microscopic characteristics or\r\nother evidence which would indicate that the bullet was not fired from\r\nthe Mannlicher-Carcano rifle owned by Lee Harvey Oswald. It was a\r\n6.5-millimeter bullet and, according to Frazier, “relatively few” types\r\nof rifles could produce the characteristics found on the bullet.[C4-734]\r\n\r\nJoseph D. Nicol, superintendent of the Illinois Bureau of Criminal\r\nIdentification and Investigation, conducted an independent examination\r\nof this bullet and concluded “that there is a fair probability” that\r\nthe bullet was fired from the rifle used in the assassination of\r\nPresident Kennedy.[C4-735] In explaining the difference between his\r\npolicy and that of the FBI on the matter of probable identification,\r\nNicol said:\r\n\r\n    I am aware of their position. This is not, I am sure, arrived\r\n    at without careful consideration. However, to say that because\r\n    one does not find sufficient marks for identification that\r\n    it is a negative, I think is going overboard in the other\r\n    direction. And for purposes of probative value, for whatever\r\n    it might be worth, in the absence of very definite negative\r\n    evidence, I think it is permissible to say that in an exhibit\r\n    such as 573 there is enough on it to say that it could have\r\n    come, and even perhaps a little stronger, to say that it\r\n    probably came from this, without going so far as to say to the\r\n    exclusion of all other guns. This I could not do.[C4-736]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Commission recognizes that neither expert was able to\r\nstate that the bullet which missed General Walker was fired from\r\nOswald’s rifle to the exclusion of all others, this testimony was\r\nconsidered probative when combined with the other testimony linking\r\nOswald to the shooting.\r\n\r\n_Additional corroborative evidence._--The admissions made to Marina\r\nOswald by her husband are an important element in the evidence that Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald fired the shot at General Walker. As shown above, the\r\nnote and the photographs of Walker’s house and of the nearby railroad\r\ntracks provide important corroboration for her account of the incident.\r\nOther details described by Marina Oswald coincide with facts developed\r\nindependently of her statements. She testified that her husband had\r\npostponed his attempt to kill Walker until that Wednesday because he\r\nhad heard that there was to be a gathering at the church next door\r\nto Walker’s house on that evening. He indicated that he wanted more\r\npeople in the vicinity at the time of the attempt so that his arrival\r\nand departure would not attract great attention.[C4-737] An official\r\nof this church told FBI agents that services are held every Wednesday\r\nat the church except during the month of August.[C4-738] Marina Oswald\r\nalso testified that her husband had used a bus to return home.[C4-739]\r\nA study of the bus routes indicates that Oswald could have taken any\r\none of several different buses to Walker’s house or to a point near the\r\nrailroad tracks where he may have concealed the rifle.[C4-740] It would\r\nhave been possible for him to take different routes in approaching and\r\nleaving the scene of the shooting.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._--Based on (1) the contents of the note which Oswald\r\nleft for his wife on April 10, 1963, (2) the photographs found among\r\nOswald’s possessions, (3) the testimony of firearms identification\r\nexperts, and (4) the testimony of Marina Oswald, the Commission has\r\nconcluded that Lee Harvey Oswald attempted to take the life of Maj.\r\nGen. Edwin A. Walker (Resigned, U.S. Army) on April 10, 1963. The\r\nfinding that Lee Harvey Oswald attempted to murder a public figure in\r\nApril 1963 was considered of probative value in this investigation,\r\nalthough the Commission’s conclusion concerning the identity of the\r\nassassin was based on evidence independent of the finding that Oswald\r\nattempted to kill General Walker.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard M. Nixon Incident\r\n\r\nAnother alleged threat by Oswald against a public figure involved\r\nformer Vice President Richard M. Nixon. In January 1964, Marina Oswald\r\nand her business manager, James Martin, told Robert Oswald, Lee Harvey\r\nOswald’s brother, that Oswald had once threatened to shoot former\r\nVice President Richard M. Nixon.[C4-741] When Marina Oswald testified\r\nbefore the Commission on February 3-6, 1964, she had failed to mention\r\nthe incident when she was asked whether Oswald had ever expressed\r\nany hostility toward any official of the United States.[C4-742] The\r\nCommission first learned of this incident when Robert Oswald related it\r\nto FBI agents on February 19, 1964,[C4-743] and to the Commission on\r\nFebruary 21.[C4-744]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald appeared before the Commission again on June 11, 1964,\r\nand testified that a few days before her husband’s departure from\r\nDallas to New Orleans on April 24, 1963, he finished reading a morning\r\nnewspaper “* * * and put on a good suit. I saw that he took a pistol.\r\nI asked him where he was going, and why he was getting dressed. He\r\nanswered ‘Nixon is coming. I want to go and have a look.’” He also said\r\nthat he would use the pistol if the opportunity arose.[C4-745] She\r\nreminded him that after the Walker shooting he had promised never to\r\nrepeat such an act. Marina Oswald related the events which followed:\r\n\r\n    I called him into the bathroom and I closed the door and I\r\n    wanted to prevent him and then I started to cry. And I told him\r\n    that he shouldn’t do this, and that he had promised me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I remember that I held him. We actually struggled for several\r\n    minutes and then he quieted down.[C4-746]\r\n\r\nShe stated that it was not physical force which kept him from leaving\r\nthe house. “I couldn’t keep him from going out if he really wanted\r\nto.”[C4-747] After further questioning she stated that she might have\r\nbeen confused about shutting him in the bathroom, but that “there is no\r\ndoubt that he got dressed and got a gun.”[C4-748]\r\n\r\nOswald’s revolver was shipped from Los Angeles on March 20,\r\n1963,[C4-749] and he left for New Orleans on April 24, 1963.[C4-750]\r\nNo edition of either Dallas newspaper during the period January 1,\r\n1963, to May 15, 1963, mentioned any proposed visit by Mr. Nixon to\r\nDallas.[C4-751] Mr. Nixon advised the Commission that the only time\r\nhe was in Dallas in 1963 was on November 20-21, 1963.[C4-752] An\r\ninvestigation failed to reveal any invitation extended to Mr. Nixon\r\nduring the period when Oswald’s threat reportedly occurred.[C4-753] The\r\nCommission has concluded, therefore, that regardless of what Oswald may\r\nhave said to his wife he was not actually planning to shoot Mr. Nixon\r\nat that time in Dallas.\r\n\r\nOn April 23, 1963, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was in Dallas for\r\na visit which had been publicized in the Dallas newspapers throughout\r\nApril.[C4-754] The Commission asked Marina Oswald whether she might\r\nhave misunderstood the object of her husband’s threat. She stated,\r\n“there is no question that in this incident it was a question of\r\nMr. Nixon.”[C4-755] When asked later whether it might have been Mr.\r\nJohnson, she said, “Yes, no. I am getting a little confused with so\r\nmany questions. I was absolutely convinced it was Nixon and now after\r\nall these questions I wonder if I am right in my mind.”[C4-756] She\r\nstated further that Oswald had only mentioned Nixon’s name once during\r\nthe incident.[C4-757] Marina Oswald might have misunderstood her\r\nhusband. Mr. Johnson was the then Vice President and his visit took\r\nplace on April 23d.[C4-758] This was 1 day before Oswald left for New\r\nOrleans and Marina appeared certain that the Nixon incident “wasn’t the\r\nday before. Perhaps 3 days before.”[C4-759]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald speculated that the incident may have been unrelated to\r\nan actual threat. She said,\r\n\r\n    * * * It might have been that he was just trying to test me.\r\n    He was the kind of person who could try and wound somebody in\r\n    that way. Possibly he didn’t want to go out at all but was just\r\n    doing this all as a sort of joke, not really as a joke but\r\n    rather to simply wound me, to make me feel bad.[C4-760]\r\n\r\nIn the absence of other evidence that Oswald actually intended\r\nto shoot someone at this time, the Commission concluded that the\r\nincident, as described by Marina Oswald, was of no probative value in\r\nthe Commission’s decision concerning the identity of the assassin of\r\nPresident Kennedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSWALD’S RIFLE CAPABILITY\r\n\r\nIn deciding whether Lee Harvey Oswald fired the shots which killed\r\nPresident Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally, the Commission\r\nconsidered whether Oswald, using his own rifle, possessed the\r\ncapability to hit his target with two out of three shots under the\r\nconditions described in chapter III. The Commission evaluated (1) the\r\nnature of the shots, (2) Oswald’s Marine training in marksmanship, (3)\r\nhis experience and practice after leaving the Marine Corps, and (4) the\r\naccuracy of the weapon and the quality of the ammunition.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nature of the Shots\r\n\r\nFor a rifleman situated on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building the shots were at a slow-moving target proceeding\r\non a downgrade in virtually a straight line with the alinement of the\r\nassassin’s rifle, at a range of 177 to 266 feet.[C4-761] An aerial\r\nphotograph of Dealey Plaza shows that Elm Street runs at an angle so\r\nthat the President would have been moving in an almost straight line\r\naway from the assassin’s rifle.[C4-762] (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n876, p. 33.) In addition, the 3° downward slope of Elm Street was of\r\nassistance in eliminating at least some of the adjustment which is\r\nordinarily required when a marksman must raise his rifle as a target\r\nmoves farther away.[C4-763]\r\n\r\nFour marksmanship experts testified before the Commission. Maj.\r\nEugene D. Anderson, assistant head of the Marksmanship Branch of\r\nthe U.S. Marine Corps, testified that the shots which struck the\r\nPresident in the neck and in the head were “not * * * particularly\r\ndifficult.”[C4-764] Robert A. Frazier, FBI expert in firearms\r\nidentification and training, said:\r\n\r\n    From my own experience in shooting over the years, when you\r\n    shoot at 175 feet or 260 feet, which is less than 100 yards,\r\n    with a telescopic sight, you should not have any difficulty in\r\n    hitting your target.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I mean it requires no training at all to shoot a weapon with a\r\n    telescopic sight once you know that you must put the crosshairs\r\n    on the target and that is all that is necessary.[C4-765]\r\n\r\nRonald Simmons, chief of the U.S. Army Infantry Weapons Evaluation\r\nBranch of the Ballistics Research Laboratory, said: “Well, in order\r\nto achieve three hits, it would not be required that a man be an\r\nexceptional shot. A proficient man with this weapon, yes.”[C4-766]\r\n\r\nThe effect of a four-power telescopic sight on the difficulty of\r\nthese shots was considered in detail by M. Sgt. James A. Zahm,\r\nnoncommissioned officer in charge of the Marksmanship Training Unit in\r\nthe Weapons Training Battalion of the Marine Corps School at Quantico,\r\nVa.[C4-767] Referring to a rifle with a four-power telescope, Sergeant\r\nZahm said:\r\n\r\n    * * * this is the ideal type of weapon for moving\r\n    targets * * *[C4-768]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    * * * Using the scope, rapidly working a bolt and using the\r\n    scope to relocate your target quickly and at the same time when\r\n    you locate that target you identify it and the crosshairs are\r\n    in close relationship to the point you want to shoot at, it\r\n    just takes a minor move in aiming to bring the crosshairs to\r\n    bear, and then it is a quick squeeze.[C4-769]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I consider it a real advantage, particularly at the range of\r\n    100 yards, in identifying your target. It allows you to see\r\n    your target clearly, and it is still of a minimum amount of\r\n    power that it doesn’t exaggerate your own body movements. It\r\n    just is an aid in seeing in the fact that you only have the one\r\n    element, the crosshair, in relation to the target as opposed to\r\n    iron sights with aligning the sights and then aligning them on\r\n    the target.[C4-770]\r\n\r\nCharacterizing the four-power scope as “a real aid, an extreme aid”\r\nin rapid fire shooting, Sergeant Zahm expressed the opinion that the\r\nshot which struck President Kennedy in the neck at 176.9 to 190.8 feet\r\nwas “very easy” and the shot which struck the President in the head\r\nat a distance of 265.3 feet was “an easy shot.”[C4-771] After viewing\r\nphotographs depicting the alinement of Elm Street in relation to the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building, Zahm stated further:\r\n\r\n    This is a definite advantage to the shooter, the vehicle moving\r\n    directly away from him and the downgrade of the street, and he\r\n    being in an elevated position made an almost stationary target\r\n    while he was aiming in, very little movement if any.[C4-772]\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald’s Marine Training\r\n\r\nIn accordance with standard Marine procedures, Oswald received\r\nextensive training in marksmanship.[C4-773] During the first week of an\r\nintensive 3-week training period he received instruction in sighting,\r\naiming, and manipulation of the trigger.[C4-774] He went through a\r\nseries of exercises called dry firing where he assumed all positions\r\nwhich would later be used in the qualification course.[C4-775] After\r\nfamiliarization with live ammunition in the .22 rifle and .22 pistol,\r\nOswald, like all Marine recruits, received training on the rifle range\r\nat distances up to 500 yards, firing 50 rounds each day for five\r\ndays.[C4-776]\r\n\r\nFollowing that training, Oswald was tested in December of 1956,\r\nand obtained a score of 212, which was 2 points above the\r\nminimum for qualifications as a “sharpshooter” in a scale of\r\nmarksman--sharpshooter--expert.[C4-777] In May of 1959, on another\r\nrange, Oswald scored 191, which was 1 point over the minimum for\r\nranking as a “marksman.”[C4-778] The Marine Corps records maintained\r\non Oswald further show that he had fired and was familiar with the\r\nBrowning Automatic rifle, .45 caliber pistol, and 12-gage riot\r\ngun.[C4-779]\r\n\r\nBased on the general Marine Corps ratings, Lt. Col. A. G. Folsom, Jr.,\r\nhead, Records Branch, Personnel Department, Headquarters U.S. Marine\r\nCorps, evaluated the sharpshooter qualification as a “fairly good shot”\r\nand a low marksman rating as a “rather poor shot.”[C4-780]\r\n\r\nWhen asked to explain the different scores achieved by Oswald on the\r\ntwo occasions when he fired for record, Major Anderson said:\r\n\r\n    * * * when he fired that [212] he had just completed a very\r\n    intensive preliminary training period. He had the services of\r\n    an experienced highly trained coach. He had high motivation. He\r\n    had presumably a good to excellent rifle and good ammunition.\r\n    We have nothing here to show under what conditions the B\r\n    course was fired. It might well have been a bad day for firing\r\n    the rifle--windy, rainy, dark. There is little probability\r\n    that he had a good, expert coach, and he probably didn’t have\r\n    as high a motivation because he was no longer in recruit\r\n    training and under the care of the drill instructor. There\r\n    is some possibility that the rifle he was firing might not\r\n    have been as good a rifle as the rifle that he was firing in\r\n    his A course firing, because [he] may well have carried this\r\n    rifle for quite some time, and it got banged around in normal\r\n    usage.[C4-781]\r\n\r\nMajor Anderson concluded:\r\n\r\n    I would say that as compared to other Marines receiving the\r\n    same type of training, that Oswald was a good shot, somewhat\r\n    better than or equal to--better than the average let us say.\r\n    As compared to a civilian who had not received this intensive\r\n    training, he would be considered as a good to excellent\r\n    shot.[C4-782]\r\n\r\nWhen Sergeant Zahm was asked whether Oswald’s Marine Corps training\r\nwould have made it easier to operate a rifle with a four-power scope,\r\nhe replied:\r\n\r\n    Based on that training, his basic knowledge in sight\r\n    manipulation and trigger squeeze and what not, I would say that\r\n    he would be capable of sighting that rifle in well, firing it,\r\n    with 10 rounds.[C4-783]\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing Oswald’s marksmanship scores, Sergeant Zahm concluded:\r\n\r\n    I would say in the Marine Corps he is a good shot, slightly\r\n    above average, and as compared to the average male of his age\r\n    throughout the civilian, throughout the United States, that he\r\n    is an excellent shot.[C4-784]\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald’s Rifle Practice Outside the Marines\r\n\r\nDuring one of his leaves from the Marines, Oswald hunted with his\r\nbrother Robert, using a .22 caliber bolt-action rifle belonging either\r\nto Robert or Robert’s in-laws.[C4-785] After he left the Marines and\r\nbefore departing for Russia, Oswald, his brother, and a third companion\r\nwent hunting for squirrels and rabbits.[C4-786] On that occasion\r\nOswald again used a bolt-action .22 caliber rifle; and according to\r\nRobert, Lee Oswald exhibited an average amount of proficiency with that\r\nweapon.[C4-787] While in Russia, Oswald obtained a hunting license,\r\njoined a hunting club and went hunting about six times, as discussed\r\nmore fully in chapter VI.[C4-788] Soon after Oswald returned from the\r\nSoviet Union he again went hunting with his brother, Robert, and used a\r\nborrowed .22 caliber bolt-action rifle.[C4-789] After Oswald purchased\r\nthe Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, he told his wife that he practiced with\r\nit.[C4-790] Marina Oswald testified that on one occasion she saw him\r\ntake the rifle, concealed in a raincoat, from the house on Neely\r\nStreet. Oswald told her he was going to practice with it.[C4-791]\r\nAccording to George De Mohrenschildt, Oswald said that he went target\r\nshooting with that rifle.[C4-792]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald testified that in New Orleans in May of 1963, she\r\nobserved Oswald sitting with the rifle on their screened porch\r\nat night, sighting with the telescopic lens and operating the\r\nbolt.[C4-793] Examination of the cartridge cases found on the sixth\r\nfloor of the Depository Building established that they had been\r\npreviously loaded and ejected from the assassination rifle, which would\r\nindicate that Oswald practiced operating the bolt.[C4-794]\r\n\r\n\r\nAccuracy of Weapon\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled from the discussion in chapter III that the\r\nassassin in all probability hit two out of the three shots during the\r\nmaximum time span of 4.8 to 5.6 seconds if the second shot missed,\r\nor, if either the first or third shots missed, the assassin fired the\r\nthree shots during a minimum time span of 7.1 to 7.9 seconds.[C4-795]\r\nA series of tests were performed to determine whether the weapon and\r\nammunition used in the assassination were capable of firing the shots\r\nwhich were fired by the assassin on November 22, 1963. The ammunition\r\nused by the assassin was manufactured by Western Cartridge Co. of\r\nEast Alton, Ill. In tests with the Mannlicher-Carcano C2766 rifle,\r\nover 100 rounds of this ammunition were fired by the FBI and the\r\nInfantry Weapons Evaluation Branch of the U.S. Army. There were no\r\nmisfires.[C4-796]\r\n\r\nIn an effort to test the rifle under conditions which simulated\r\nthose which prevailed during the assassination, the Infantry Weapons\r\nEvaluation Branch of the Ballistics Research Laboratory had expert\r\nriflemen fire the assassination weapon from a tower at three silhouette\r\ntargets at distances of 175, 240, and 265 feet. The target at 265 feet\r\nwas placed to the right of the 240-foot target which was in turn placed\r\nto the right of the closest silhouette.[C4-797] Using the assassination\r\nrifle mounted with the telescopic sight, three marksmen, rated as\r\nmaster by the National Rifle Association, each fired two series of\r\nthree shots. In the first series the firers required time spans of 4.6,\r\n6.75, and 8.25 seconds respectively. On the second series they required\r\n5.15, 6.45, and 7 seconds. None of the marksmen had any practice with\r\nthe assassination weapon except for exercising the bolt for 2 or 3\r\nminutes on a dry run. They had not even pulled the trigger because of\r\nconcern about breaking the firing pin.[C4-798]\r\n\r\nThe marksmen took as much time as they wanted for the first target and\r\nall hit the target.[C4-799] For the first four attempts, the firers\r\nmissed the second shot by several inches.[C4-800] The angle from the\r\nfirst to the second shot was greater than from the second to the third\r\nshot and required a movement in the basic firing position of the\r\nmarksmen.[C4-801] This angle was used in the test because the majority\r\nof the eyewitnesses to the assassination stated that there was a\r\nshorter interval between shots two and three than between shots one and\r\ntwo.[C4-802] As has been shown in chapter III, if the three shots were\r\nfired within a period of from 4.8 to 5.6 seconds, the shots would have\r\nbeen evenly spaced and the assassin would not have incurred so sharp an\r\nangular movement.[C4-803]\r\n\r\nFive of the six shots hit the third target where the angle of movement\r\nof the weapon was small.[C4-804] On the basis of these results,\r\nSimmons testified that in his opinion the probability of hitting the\r\ntargets at the relatively short range at which they were hit was very\r\nhigh.[C4-805] Considering the various probabilities which may have\r\nprevailed during the actual assassination, the highest level of firing\r\nperformance which would have been required of the assassin and the\r\nC2766 rifle would have been to fire three times and hit the target\r\ntwice within a span of 4.8 to 5.6 seconds. In fact, one of the firers\r\nin the rapid fire test in firing his two series of three shots, hit\r\nthe target twice within a span of 4.6 and 5.15 seconds. The others\r\nwould have been able to reduce their times if they had been given the\r\nopportunity to become familiar with the movement of the bolt and the\r\ntrigger pull.[C4-806] Simmons testified that familiarity with the bolt\r\ncould be achieved in dry practice and, as has been indicated above,\r\nOswald engaged in such practice.[C4-807] If the assassin missed either\r\nthe first or third shot, he had a total of between 4.8 and 5.6 seconds\r\nbetween the two shots which hit and a total minimum time period of from\r\n7.1 to 7.9 seconds for all three shots. All three of the firers in\r\nthese tests were able to fire the rounds within the time period which\r\nwould have been available to the assassin under those conditions.\r\n\r\nThree FBI firearms experts tested the rifle in order to determine the\r\nspeed with which it could be fired. The purpose of this experiment was\r\nnot to test the rifle under conditions which prevailed at the time of\r\nthe assassination but to determine the maximum speed at which it could\r\nbe fired. The three FBI experts each fired three shots from the weapon\r\nat 15 yards in 6, 7, and 9 seconds, and one of these agents, Robert A.\r\nFrazier, fired two series of three shots at 25 yards in 4.6 and 4.8\r\nseconds.[C4-808] At 15 yards each man’s shots landed within the size\r\nof a dime.[C4-809] The shots fired by Frazier at the range of 25 yards\r\nlanded within an area of 2 inches and 5 inches respectively.[C4-810]\r\nFrazier later fired four groups of three shots at a distance of 100\r\nyards in 5.9, 6.2, 5.6, and 6.5 seconds. Each series of three shots\r\nlanded within areas ranging in diameter from 3 to 5 inches.[C4-811]\r\nAlthough all of the shots were a few inches high and to the right\r\nof the target, this was because of a defect in the scope which was\r\nrecognized by the FBI agents and which they could have compensated for\r\nif they were aiming to hit a bull’s-eye.[C4-812] They were instead\r\nfiring to determine how rapidly the weapon could be fired and the area\r\nwithin which three shots could be placed. Frazier testified that while\r\nhe could not tell when the defect occurred, but that a person familiar\r\nwith the weapon could compensate for it.[C4-813] Moreover, the defect\r\nwas one which would have assisted the assassin aiming at a target which\r\nwas moving away. Frazier said, “The fact that the crosshairs are set\r\nhigh would actually compensate for any lead which had to be taken. So\r\nthat if you aimed with this weapon as it actually was received at the\r\nlaboratory, it would not be necessary to take any lead whatsoever in\r\norder to hit the intended object. The scope would accomplish the lead\r\nfor you.” Frazier added that the scope would cause a slight miss to\r\nthe right. It should be noted, however, that the President’s car was\r\ncurving slightly to the right when the third shot was fired.\r\n\r\nBased on these tests the experts agreed that the assassination rifle\r\nwas an accurate weapon. Simmons described it as “quite accurate,” in\r\nfact, as accurate as current military rifles.[C4-814] Frazier testified\r\nthat the rifle was accurate, that it had less recoil than the average\r\nmilitary rifle and that one would not have to be an expert marksman\r\nto have accomplished the assassination with the weapon which was\r\nused.[C4-815]\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThe various tests showed that the Mannlicher-Carcano was an accurate\r\nrifle and that the use of a four-power scope was a substantial aid\r\nto rapid, accurate firing. Oswald’s Marine training in marksmanship,\r\nhis other rifle experience and his established familiarity with this\r\nparticular weapon show that he possessed ample capability to commit\r\nthe assassination. Based on the known facts of the assassination,\r\nthe Marine marksmanship experts, Major Anderson and Sergeant Zahm,\r\nconcurred in the opinion that Oswald had the capability to fire three\r\nshots, with two hits, within 4.8 and 5.6 seconds.[C4-816] Concerning\r\nthe shots which struck the President in the back of the neck, Sergeant\r\nZahm testified: “With the equipment he [Oswald] had and with his\r\nability I consider it a very easy shot.”[C4-817] Having fired this shot\r\nthe assassin was then required to hit the target one more time within a\r\nspace of from 4.8 to 5.6 seconds. On the basis of Oswald’s training and\r\nthe accuracy of the weapon as established by the tests, the Commission\r\nconcluded that Oswald was capable of accomplishing this second hit\r\neven if there was an intervening shot which missed. The probability of\r\nhitting the President a second time would have been markedly increased\r\nif, in fact, he had missed either the first or third shots thereby\r\nleaving a time span of 4.8 to 5.6 seconds between the two shots which\r\nstruck their mark. The Commission agrees with the testimony of Marine\r\nmarksmanship expert Zahm that it was “an easy shot” to hit some part of\r\nthe President’s body, and that the range where the rifleman would be\r\nexpected to hit would include the President’s head.[C4-818]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the evidence reviewed in this chapter, the Commission\r\nhas found that Lee Harvey Oswald (1) owned and possessed the rifle used\r\nto kill President Kennedy and wound Governor Connally, (2) brought this\r\nrifle into the Depository Building on the morning of the assassination,\r\n(3) was present, at the time of the assassination, at the window\r\nfrom which the shots were fired, (4) killed Dallas Police Officer\r\nJ. D. Tippit in an apparent attempt to escape, (5) resisted arrest by\r\ndrawing a fully loaded pistol and attempting to shoot another police\r\nofficer, (6) lied to the police after his arrest concerning important\r\nsubstantive matters, (7) attempted, in April 1963, to kill Maj. Gen.\r\nEdwin A. Walker, and (8) possessed the capability with a rifle which\r\nwould have enabled him to commit the assassination. On the basis of\r\nthese findings the Commission has concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was\r\nthe assassin of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDetention and Death of Oswald\r\n\r\n\r\nLee Harvey Oswald spent almost all of the last 48 hours of his life\r\nin the Police and Courts Building, a gray stone structure in downtown\r\nDallas that housed the headquarters of the Dallas Police Department and\r\nthe city jail. Following his arrest early Friday afternoon, Oswald was\r\nbrought immediately to this building and remained there until Sunday\r\nmorning, November 24, when he was scheduled to be transferred to the\r\ncounty jail. At 11:21 that morning, in full view of millions of people\r\nwatching on television, Oswald was fatally wounded by Jack Ruby, who\r\nemerged suddenly from the crowd of newsmen and policemen witnessing the\r\ntransfer and fired a single shot at Oswald.\r\n\r\nWhether the killing of Oswald was part of a conspiracy involving\r\nthe assassination of President Kennedy is considered in chapter VI.\r\nAside from that question, the occurrences within the Police and\r\nCourts Building between November 22 and 24 raise other important\r\nissues concerning the conduct of law enforcement officials, the\r\nresponsibilities of the press, the rights of accused persons, and\r\nthe administration of criminal justice in the United States. The\r\nCommission has therefore deemed it necessary to determine the facts\r\nconcerning Oswald’s detention and death and to evaluate the actions and\r\nresponsibilities of the police and press involved in these events.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF OSWALD IN CUSTODY\r\n\r\nThe focal center of the Police and Courts Building during Oswald’s\r\ndetention was the third floor, which housed the main offices of the\r\nDallas Police Department. The public elevators on this floor opened\r\ninto a lobby midpoint of a corridor that extended along the length of\r\nthe floor for about 140 feet. At one end of this 7-foot-wide corridor\r\nwere the offices occupied by Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry and his\r\nimmediate subordinates; at the other end was a small pressroom that\r\ncould accommodate only a handful of reporters. Along this corridor were\r\nother police offices, including those of the major detective bureaus.\r\nBetween the pressroom and the lobby was the complex of offices\r\nbelonging to the homicide and robbery bureau, headed by Capt. J. Will\r\nFritz.[C5-1] (See Commission Exhibit No. 2175, p. 197.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2175\r\n\r\nTHIRD FLOOR PLAN DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT DALLAS, TEXAS]\r\n\r\n\r\nChronology\r\n\r\nThe policemen who seized Oswald at the Texas Theatre arrived with him\r\nat the police department building at about 2 p.m. and brought him\r\nimmediately to the third floor offices of the homicide and robbery\r\nbureau to await the arrival of Captain Fritz from the Texas School\r\nBook Depository. After about 15 or 20 minutes Oswald was ushered into\r\nthe office of Captain Fritz for the first of several interrogation\r\nsessions.[C5-2] At 4:05 p.m. he was taken to the basement assembly room\r\nfor his first lineup.[C5-3] While waiting outside the lineup room,\r\nOswald was searched, and five cartridges and other items were removed\r\nfrom his pockets.[C5-4] After the lineup, at about 4:20, Oswald was\r\nreturned to Captain Fritz’ office for further questioning.[C5-5] Two\r\nhours later, at 6:20 p.m., Oswald was taken downstairs for a second\r\nlineup and returned to Captain Fritz’ office within 15 minutes for\r\nadditional interrogation.[C5-6] Shortly after 7 p.m., Captain Fritz\r\nsigned a complaint charging Oswald with the murder of Patrolman Tippit.\r\nOswald was formally arraigned, i.e., advised of the charges, at 7:10\r\np.m., before Justice of the Peace David L. Johnston, who came to\r\nCaptain Fritz’ office for the occasion.[C5-7]\r\n\r\nAfter a third lineup at about 7:40 p.m., Oswald was returned to Fritz’\r\noffice.[C5-8] About an hour later, after further questioning, Oswald’s\r\nfingerprints and palmprints were taken and a paraffin test (see\r\napp. XI) administered in Fritz’ office, after which the questioning\r\nresumed.[C5-9] At 11:26 p.m. Fritz signed the complaint charging Oswald\r\nwith the murder of President Kennedy.[C5-10] Shortly after midnight,\r\ndetectives took Oswald to the basement assembly room for an appearance\r\nof several minutes before members of the press.[C5-11] At about 12:20\r\na.m. Oswald was delivered to the jailer who placed him in a maximum\r\nsecurity cell on the fifth floor.[C5-12] His cell was the center one in\r\na block of three cells that were separated from the remainder of the\r\njail area. The cells on either side of Oswald were empty and a guard\r\nwas nearby whenever Oswald was present.[C5-13] Shortly after 1:30 a.m.\r\nOswald was brought to the identification bureau on the fourth floor\r\nand arraigned before Justice of the Peace Johnston, this time for the\r\nmurder of President Kennedy.[C5-14]\r\n\r\nQuestioning resumed in Fritz’ office on Saturday morning at about 10:25\r\na.m., and the session lasted nearly an hour and 10 minutes.[C5-15]\r\nOswald was then returned to his cell for an hour, and at 12:35 p.m.\r\nhe was brought back to Fritz’ office for an additional half-hour of\r\nquestioning.[C5-16] From 1:10 to 1:30 p.m., Oswald’s wife and mother\r\nvisited him in the fourth floor visiting area;[C5-17] at 1:40 p.m.\r\nhe attempted to call an attorney in New York.[C5-18] He appeared in\r\nanother lineup at 2:15 p.m.[C5-19] At 2:45 p.m., with Oswald’s consent,\r\na member of the identification bureau obtained fingernail scrapings\r\nand specimens of hair from him.[C5-20] He returned to the fourth floor\r\nat 3:30 p.m. for a 10-minute visit with his brother, Robert.[C5-21]\r\nBetween 4 and 4:30 p.m., Oswald made two telephone calls to Mrs. Ruth\r\nPaine[C5-22] at her home in Irving; at about 5:30 p.m. he was visited\r\nby the president of the Dallas Bar Association[C5-23] with whom he\r\nspoke for about 5 minutes. From 6 to 7:15 p.m. Oswald was interrogated\r\nonce again in Captain Fritz’ office and then returned to his\r\ncell.[C5-24] At 8 p.m. he called the Paine residence again and asked to\r\nspeak to his wife, but Mrs. Paine told him that his wife was no longer\r\nthere.[C5-25]\r\n\r\nOswald was signed out of jail at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, November 24, and\r\ntaken to Captain Fritz’ office for a final round of questioning.[C5-26]\r\nThe transfer party left Fritz’ office at about 11:15 a.m.;[C5-27] at\r\n11:21 a.m. Oswald was shot.[C5-28] He was declared dead at Parkland\r\nHospital at 1:07 p.m.[C5-29]\r\n\r\n\r\nInterrogation Sessions\r\n\r\nDuring the period between 2:30 p.m. on Friday afternoon and 11:15 a.m.\r\nSunday morning, Oswald was interrogated for a total of approximately 12\r\nhours.[C5-30] Though subject to intermittent questioning for more than\r\n7 hours on Friday, Oswald was given 8 to 9 hours to rest that night.\r\nOn Saturday he was questioned for a total of only 3 hours during three\r\ninterrogation sessions, and on Sunday he was questioned for less than 2\r\nhours.[C5-31] (These interrogations are discussed in ch. IV.)\r\n\r\nCaptain Fritz’ office, within which the interrogations took place,\r\nwas a small room, 14 feet by 9½ feet in size.[C5-32] In addition to\r\nthe policemen guarding the prisoner, those present usually included\r\nDallas detectives, investigators from the FBI and the Secret Service,\r\nand occasionally other officials, particularly a post office inspector\r\nand the U.S. marshal. (See statements in app. XI.) As many as seven\r\nor eight people crowded into the small office.[C5-33] In all, more\r\nthan 25 different persons participated in or were present at some\r\ntime during interrogations. Captain Fritz, who conducted most of\r\nthe interrogations, was frequently called from the room. He said,\r\n“I don’t believe there was any time when I went through a very long\r\nperiod without having to step to the door, or step outside, to get\r\na report from some pair of officers, or to give them additional\r\nassignments.”[C5-34] In his absence, others present would occasionally\r\nquestion Oswald.[C5-35]\r\n\r\nThe interrogators differ on whether the confusion prevailing in the\r\nmain third floor corridor penetrated Fritz’ office and affected the\r\natmosphere within.[C5-36] Oswald’s processions through the third floor\r\ncorridor, described more fully below, tended, in Fritz’ opinion,\r\nto keep Oswald upset, and the remarks and questions of newsmen\r\nsometimes caused him to become annoyed. Despite the confusion that\r\nfrequently prevailed, Oswald remained calm most of the time during the\r\ninterrogations.[C5-37] According to Captain Fritz:\r\n\r\n    You know I didn’t have trouble with him. If we would just\r\n    talk to him quietly like we are talking right now, we talked\r\n    all right until I asked him a question that meant something,\r\n    every time I asked him a question that meant something, that\r\n    would produce evidence he immediately told me he wouldn’t tell\r\n    me about it and he seemed to anticipate what I was going to\r\n    ask.[C5-38]\r\n\r\nSpecial Agent James W. Bookhout, who represented the FBI at most of the\r\ninterrogations, stated, “I think generally you might say anytime that\r\nyou asked a question that would be pertinent to the investigation, that\r\nwould be the type of question he would refuse to discuss.”[C5-39]\r\n\r\nThe number of people in the interrogation room and the tumultuous\r\natmosphere throughout the third floor made it difficult for the\r\ninterrogators to gain Oswald’s confidence and to encourage him to be\r\ntruthful. As Chief Curry has recognized in his testimony, “we were\r\nviolating every principle of interrogation * * * it was just against\r\nall principles of good interrogation practice.”[C5-40]\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald’s Legal Rights\r\n\r\nAll available evidence indicates that Oswald was not subjected to any\r\nphysical hardship during the interrogation sessions or at any other\r\ntime while he was in custody. He was fed and allowed to rest. When he\r\nprotested on Friday against being handcuffed from behind, the cuffs\r\nwere removed and he was handcuffed in front.[C5-41] Although he made\r\nremarks to newsmen about desiring a shower and demanding his “civil\r\nrights,” Oswald did not complain about his treatment to any of the\r\nnumerous police officers and other persons who had much to do with him\r\nduring the 2 days of his detention.[C5-42] As described in chapter IV,\r\nOswald received a slight cut over his right eye and a bruise under his\r\nleft eye during the scuffle in the Texas Theatre with the arresting\r\nofficers, three of whom were injured and required medical treatment.\r\nThese marks were visible to all who saw him during the 2 days of his\r\ndetention and to millions of television viewers.[C5-43]\r\n\r\nBefore the first questioning session on Friday afternoon, Fritz warned\r\nOswald that he was not compelled to make any statement and that\r\nstatements he did make could be used against him.[C5-44] About 5 hours\r\nlater, he was arraigned for the Tippit murder and within an additional\r\n6½ hours he was arraigned for the murder of President Kennedy. On each\r\noccasion the justice of the peace advised Oswald of his right to obtain\r\ncounsel and the right to remain silent.[C5-45]\r\n\r\nThroughout the period of detention, however, Oswald was not represented\r\nby counsel. At the Friday midnight press conference in the basement\r\nassembly room, he made the following remarks:\r\n\r\n    OSWALD. Well, I was questioned by Judge ---- [Johnston].\r\n    However, I protested at that time that I was not allowed legal\r\n    representation during that very short and sweet hearing. I\r\n    really don’t know what the situation is about. Nobody has\r\n    told me anything except that I am accused of, of, murdering\r\n    a policeman. I know nothing more than that and I do request\r\n    someone to come forward to give me legal assistance.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you kill the President?\r\n\r\n    A. No. I have not been charged with that. In fact nobody has\r\n    said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it was when\r\n    the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Q. Mr. Oswald, how did you hurt your eye?\r\n\r\n    A. A policeman hit me.[C5-46]\r\n\r\nAt this time Oswald had been arraigned only for the murder of\r\nPatrolman Tippit, but questioning by Captain Fritz and others had\r\nbeen substantially concerned with Oswald’s connection with the\r\nassassination.[C5-47]\r\n\r\nOn Friday evening, representatives of the American Civil Liberties\r\nUnion visited the police department to determine whether Oswald was\r\nbeing deprived of counsel. They were assured by police officials and\r\nJustice of the Peace Johnston that Oswald had been informed of his\r\nrights and was being allowed to seek a lawyer.[C5-48] On Saturday\r\nOswald attempted several times to reach John Abt, a New York lawyer,\r\nby telephone, but with no success.[C5-49] In the afternoon, he called\r\nRuth Paine and asked her to try to reach Abt for him, but she too\r\nfailed.[C5-50] Later in the afternoon, H. Louis Nichols, president of\r\nthe Dallas Bar Association, visited Oswald in his cell and asked him\r\nwhether he wanted the association to obtain a lawyer for him. Oswald\r\ndeclined the offer, stating a first preference for Abt and a second\r\npreference for a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union.[C5-51]\r\nAs late as Sunday morning, according to Postal Inspector Harry D.\r\nHolmes, Oswald said that he preferred to get his own lawyer.[C5-52]\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITY OF NEWSMEN\r\n\r\nWithin an hour of Oswald’s arrival at the police department on November\r\n22, it became known to newsmen that he was a possible suspect in the\r\nslaying of President Kennedy as well as in the murder of Patrolman\r\nTippit. At least as early as 3:26 p.m. a television report carried this\r\ninformation. Reporters and cameramen flooded into the building and\r\ncongregated in the corridor of the third floor, joining those few who\r\nhad been present when Oswald first arrived.[C5-53]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Third Floor\r\n\r\nFelix McKnight, editor of the Dallas Times-Herald, who handled press\r\narrangements for the President’s visit, estimated that within 24 hours\r\nof the assassination more than 300 representatives of news media were\r\nin Dallas, including correspondents from foreign newspapers and press\r\nassociations.[C5-54] District Attorney Henry M. Wade thought that the\r\ncrowd in the third floor hallway itself may have numbered as many as\r\n300.[C5-55] Most estimates, including those based on examination of\r\nvideo tapes, place upwards of 100 newsmen and cameramen in the third\r\nfloor corridor of the police department by the evening of November\r\n22.[C5-56] (See Commission Exhibit No. 2633, p. 203.)\r\n\r\nIn the words of an FBI agent who was present, the conditions at the\r\npolice station were “not too much unlike Grand Central Station at rush\r\nhour, maybe like the Yankee Stadium during the World Series games. *\r\n* *”[C5-57] In the lobby of the third floor, television cameramen set\r\nup two large cameras and floodlights in strategic positions that gave\r\nthem a sweep of the corridor in either direction. Technicians stretched\r\ntheir television cables into and out of offices, running some of them\r\nout of the windows of a deputy chief’s office and down the side of the\r\nbuilding. Men with newsreel cameras, still cameras, and microphones,\r\nmore mobile than the television cameramen, moved back and forth seeking\r\ninformation and opportunities for interviews. Newsmen wandered into the\r\noffices of other bureaus located on the third floor, sat on desks, and\r\nused police telephones; indeed, one reporter admits hiding a telephone\r\nbehind a desk so that he would have exclusive access to it if something\r\ndeveloped.[C5-58]\r\n\r\nBy the time Chief Curry returned to the building in the middle of the\r\nafternoon from Love Field where he had escorted President Johnson from\r\nParkland Hospital, he found that “there was just pandemonium on the\r\nthird floor.”[C5-59] The news representatives, he testified:\r\n\r\n    * * * were jammed into the north hall of the third floor,\r\n    which are the offices of the criminal investigation division.\r\n    The television trucks, there were several of them around the\r\n    city hall. I went into my administrative offices, I saw cables\r\n    coming through the administrative assistant office and through\r\n    the deputy chief of traffic through his office, and running\r\n    through the hall they had a live TV set up on the third floor,\r\n    and it was a bedlam of confusion.[C5-60]\r\n\r\nAccording to Special Agent Winston G. Lawson of the Secret Service:\r\n\r\n    At least by 6 or 7 o’clock * * * [the reporters and cameramen]\r\n    were quite in evidence up and down the corridors, cameras on\r\n    the tripods, the sound equipment, people with still cameras,\r\n    motion picture-type hand cameras, all kinds of people with tape\r\n    recorders, and they were trying to interview people, anybody\r\n    that belonged in police headquarters that might know anything\r\n    about Oswald * * *[C5-61]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2633\r\n\r\nScene in third floor corridor.]\r\n\r\nThe corridor became so jammed that policemen and newsmen had to\r\npush and shove if they wanted to get through, stepping over cables,\r\nwires, and tripods.[C5-62] The crowd in the hallway was so dense that\r\nDistrict Attorney Wade found it a “strain to get the door open” to\r\nget into the homicide office.[C5-63] According to Lawson, “You had to\r\nliterally fight your way through the people to get up and down the\r\ncorridor.”[C5-64] A witness who was escorted into the homicide offices\r\non Saturday afternoon related that he\r\n\r\n    tried to get by the reporters, stepping over television cables\r\n    and you couldn’t hardly get by, they would grab you and wanted\r\n    to know what you were doing down here, even with the detectives\r\n    one in front and one behind you.[C5-65]\r\n\r\nThe television cameras continued to record the scene on the third floor\r\nas some of the newsmen kept vigil through the night.[C5-66]\r\n\r\nSuch police efforts as there were to control the newsmen were\r\nunavailing. Capt. Glen D. King, administrative assistant to Chief\r\nCurry, witnessed efforts to clear an aisle through the hallway, but\r\nrelated that “this was a constant battle because of the number of\r\nnewsmen who were there. They would move back into the aisleway that had\r\nbeen cleared. They interfered with the movement of people who had to\r\nbe there.”[C5-67] According to one detective, “they would be asked to\r\nstand back and stay back but it wouldn’t do much good, and they would\r\npush forward and you had to hold them off physically.” The detective\r\nrecalled that on one occasion when he was escorting a witness through\r\nthe corridor he “stopped * * * and looked down and there was a joker\r\nhad a camera stuck between * * * [his] legs taking pictures. * *\r\n*”[C5-68] Forrest V. Sorrels of the Secret Service had the impression\r\nthat the “press and the television people just * * * took over.”[C5-69]\r\n\r\nPolice control over the access of other than newsmen to the third floor\r\nwas of limited but increasing effectiveness after Oswald’s arrival\r\nat the police department. Initially no steps were taken to exclude\r\nunauthorized persons from the third floor corridor, but late Friday\r\nafternoon Assistant Chief Charles Batchelor stationed guards at the\r\nelevators and the stairway to prevent the admission of such persons. He\r\nalso directed the records room in the basement to issue passes, after\r\nverification by the bureaus involved, to people who had legitimate\r\nbusiness on the third floor.[C5-70] Throughout the 3 days of Oswald’s\r\ndetention, the police were obliged to continue normal business in\r\nall five bureaus located along the third floor hallway. Thus many\r\npersons--relatives of prisoners, complainants, witnesses[C5-71]--had\r\noccasion to visit police offices on the third floor on business\r\nunrelated to the investigation of the assassination.\r\n\r\nNewsmen seeking admission to the third floor were required to identify\r\nthemselves by their personal press cards; however, the department\r\ndid not follow its usual procedure of checking the authenticity of\r\npress credentials.[C5-72] Captain King felt that this would have\r\nbeen impossible in light of “the atmosphere that existed over there,\r\nthe tremendous pressures that existed, the fact that telephones were\r\nringing constantly, that there were droves of people in there * * *\r\nthe fact that the method by which you positively identify someone * * *\r\nit’s not easy.”[C5-73]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2631\r\n\r\nOswald being moved through third floor corridor.]\r\n\r\nPolice officers on the third floor testified that they carefully\r\nchecked all persons for credentials, and most newsmen indicated that\r\nafter Batchelor imposed security they were required to identify\r\nthemselves by their press cards.[C5-74] Special Agent Sorrels of the\r\nSecret Service stated that he was requested to present credentials on\r\nsome of his visits to the third floor.[C5-75] However, other newsmen\r\napparently went unchallenged during the entire period before Oswald was\r\nkilled, although some of them were wearing press badges on their lapels\r\nand some may have been known to the police officers.[C5-76]\r\n\r\nAccording to some reporters and policemen, people who appeared to\r\nbe unauthorized were present on the third floor after security\r\nprocedures were instituted, and video tapes seem to confirm their\r\nobservations.[C5-77] Jack Ruby was present on the third floor on Friday\r\nnight.[C5-78] Assistant Chief of Police N. T. Fisher testified that\r\neven on Saturday “anybody could come up with a plausible reason for\r\ngoing to one of the third floor bureaus and was able to get in.”[C5-79]\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald and the Press\r\n\r\nWhen the police car bringing Oswald from the Texas Theatre drove into\r\nthe basement of police headquarters at about 2 p.m. on Friday, some\r\nreporters and cameramen, principally from local papers and stations,\r\nwere already on hand. The policemen formed a wedge around Oswald and\r\nconducted him to the elevator, but several newsmen crowded into the\r\nelevator with Oswald and the police. When the elevator stopped at the\r\nthird floor, the cameramen ran ahead down the corridor, and then turned\r\naround and backed up, taking pictures of Oswald as he was escorted\r\ntoward the homicide and robbery bureau office. According to one\r\nescorting officer, some six or seven reporters followed the police into\r\nthe bureau office.[C5-80]\r\n\r\nFrom Friday afternoon, when Oswald arrived in the building, until\r\nSunday, newspaper reporters and television cameras focused their\r\nattention on the homicide office. In full view and within arm’s length\r\nof the assembled newsmen, Oswald traversed the 20 feet of corridor\r\nbetween the homicide office and the locked door leading to the jail\r\nelevator at least 15 times after his initial arrival. The jail\r\nelevator, sealed off from public use, took him to his fifth floor cell\r\nand to the assembly room in the basement for lineups and the Friday\r\nnight news conference.[C5-81]\r\n\r\nOn most occasions, Oswald’s escort of three to six detectives and\r\npolicemen had to push their way through the newsmen who sought to\r\nsurround them. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2631, p. 205.) Although\r\nthe Dallas press normally did not take pictures of a prisoner without\r\nfirst obtaining permission of the police, who generally asked the\r\nprisoner, this practice was not followed by any of the newsmen with\r\nOswald.[C5-82] Generally when Oswald appeared the newsmen turned their\r\ncameras on him, thrust microphones at his face, and shouted questions\r\nat him. Sometimes he answered. Reporters in the forefront of the throng\r\nwould repeat his answers for the benefit of those behind them who could\r\nnot hear. On Saturday, however in response to police admonitions,\r\nthe reporters exercised more restraint and shouted fewer questions at\r\nOswald when he passed through the corridor.[C5-83]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2965\r\n\r\nOSWALD AT PRESS CONFERENCE IN ASSEMBLY ROOM, FRIDAY NIGHT]\r\n\r\nOswald’s most prolonged exposure occurred at the midnight press\r\nconference on Friday night. In response to demands of newsmen, District\r\nAttorney Wade, after consulting with Chief Curry and Captain Fritz, had\r\nannounced shortly before midnight that Oswald would appear at a press\r\nconference in the basement assembly room.[C5-84] An estimated 70 to 100\r\npeople, including Jack Ruby, and other unauthorized persons, crowded\r\ninto the small downstairs room. No identification was required.[C5-85]\r\nThe room was so packed that Deputy Chief M. W. Stevenson and Captain\r\nFritz who came down to the basement after the crowd had assembled could\r\nnot get in and were forced to remain in the doorway.[C5-86]\r\n\r\nOswald was brought into the room shortly after midnight.[C5-87] Curry\r\nhad instructed policemen not to permit newsmen to touch Oswald or\r\nget close to him, but no steps were taken to shield Oswald from the\r\ncrowd.[C5-88] Captain Fritz had asked that Oswald be placed on the\r\nplatform used for lineups so that he could be more easily removed “if\r\nanything happened.”[C5-89] Chief Curry, however, insisted that Oswald\r\nstand on the floor in front of the stage, where he was also in front of\r\nthe one-way nylon-cloth screen customarily used to prevent a suspect\r\nfrom seeing those present in the room. This was done because cameramen\r\nhad told Curry that their cameras would not photograph well through the\r\nscreen.[C5-90]\r\n\r\nCurry had instructed the reporters that they were not to “ask any\r\nquestions and try to interview * * * [Oswald] in any way,” but when he\r\nwas brought into the room, “immediately they began to shoot questions\r\nat him and shove microphones into his face.”[C5-91] It was difficult\r\nto hear Oswald’s answers above the uproar. Cameramen stood on the\r\ntables to take pictures and others pushed forward to get close-ups.\r\n(See Commission Exhibit No. 2965, p. 207.) The noise and confusion\r\nmounted as reporters shouted at each other to get out of the way and\r\ncamermen made frantic efforts to get into position for pictures.[C5-92]\r\nAfter Oswald had been in the room only a few minutes, Chief Curry\r\nintervened and directed that Oswald be taken back to the jail because,\r\nhe testified, the newsmen “tried to overrun him.”[C5-93]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ABORTIVE TRANSFER\r\n\r\nIn Dallas, after a person is charged with a felony, the county sheriff\r\nordinarily takes custody of the prisoner and assumes responsibility for\r\nhis safekeeping. Normally, the Dallas Police Department notifies the\r\nsheriff when a prisoner has been charged with a felony and the sheriff\r\ndispatches his deputies to transport the accused to the county jail.\r\nThis is usually done within a few hours after the complaint has been\r\nfiled. In cases of unusual importance, however, the Dallas city police\r\nsometimes transport the prisoners to the county jail.[C5-94]\r\n\r\nThe decision to move Oswald to the county jail on Sunday morning\r\nwas reached by Chief Curry the preceding evening. Sometime after\r\n7:30 Saturday evening, according to Assistant Chief Batchelor, two\r\nreporters told him that they wanted to go out to dinner but that “they\r\ndidn’t want to miss anything if we were going to move the prisoner.”\r\nCurry came upon them at that point and told the two newsmen that\r\nif they returned by 10 o’clock in the morning, they wouldn’t “miss\r\nanything.”[C5-95] A little later, after checking with Captain Fritz,\r\nCurry made a similar announcement to the assembled reporters. Curry\r\nreported the making of his decision to move Oswald as follows:\r\n\r\n    Then, I talked to Fritz about when he thought he would transfer\r\n    the prisoner, and he didn’t think it was a good idea to\r\n    transfer him at night because of the fact you couldn’t see, and\r\n    if anybody tried to cause them any trouble, they needed to see\r\n    who they were and where it was coming from and so forth, and\r\n    he suggested that we wait until daylight, so this was normal\r\n    procedure, I mean, for Fritz to determine when he is going to\r\n    transfer his prisoners, so I told him “Okay.” I asked him, I\r\n    said, “What time do you think you will be ready tomorrow?”\r\n    And he didn’t know exactly and I said, “Do you think about 10\r\n    o’clock,” and he said, “I believe so,” and then is when I went\r\n    out and told the newspaper people * * * “I believe if you are\r\n    back here by 10 o’clock you will be back in time to observe\r\n    anything you care to observe.”[C5-96]\r\n\r\nDuring the night, between 2:30 and 3 a.m., the local office of the FBI\r\nand the sheriff’s office received telephone calls from an unidentified\r\nman who warned that a committee had decided “to kill the man that\r\nkilled the President.”[C5-97] Shortly after, an FBI agent notified\r\nthe Dallas police of the anonymous threat. The police department and\r\nultimately Chief Curry were informed of both threats.[C5-98]\r\n\r\nImmediately after his arrival at the building on Sunday morning between\r\n8:30 and 8:45 a.m., Curry spoke by telephone with Sheriff J. E. Decker\r\nabout the transfer. When Decker indicated that he would leave to Curry\r\nthe decision on whether the sheriff’s office or the police would move\r\nOswald, Curry decided that the police would handle it because “we had\r\nso much involved here, we were the ones that were investigating the\r\ncase and we had the officers set up downstairs to handle it.”[C5-99]\r\n\r\nAfter talking with Decker, Curry began to discuss plans for the\r\ntransfer. With the threats against Oswald in mind, Curry suggested to\r\nBatchelor and Deputy Chief Stevenson that Oswald be transported to the\r\ncounty jail in an armored truck, to which they agreed. While Batchelor\r\nmade arrangements to have an armored truck brought to the building,\r\nCurry and Stevenson tentatively agreed on the route the armored truck\r\nwould follow from the building to the county jail.[C5-100]\r\n\r\nCurry decided that Oswald would leave the building via the basement. He\r\nstated later that he reached this decision shortly after his arrival\r\nat the police building Sunday morning, when members of the press had\r\nalready begun to gather in the basement. There is no evidence that\r\nanyone opposed this decision.[C5-101] Two members of the Dallas police\r\ndid suggest to Captain Fritz that Oswald be taken from the building\r\nby another exit, leaving the press “waiting in the basement and on\r\nCommerce Street, and we could be to the county jail before anyone\r\nknew what was taking place.”[C5-102] However, Fritz said that he did\r\nnot think Curry would agree to such a plan because he had promised\r\nthat Oswald would be transferred at a time when newsmen could take\r\npictures.[C5-103] Forrest Sorrels also suggested to Fritz that Oswald\r\nbe moved at an unannounced time when no one was around, but Fritz again\r\nresponded that Curry “wanted to go along with the press and not try to\r\nput anything over on them.”[C5-104]\r\n\r\nPreliminary arrangements to obtain additional personnel to assist\r\nwith the transfer were begun Saturday evening. On Saturday night,\r\nthe police reserves were requested to provide 8 to 10 men on Sunday,\r\nand additional reservists were sought in the morning.[C5-105] Capt.\r\nC. E. Talbert, who was in charge of the patrol division for the city\r\nof Dallas on the morning of November 24, retained a small number of\r\npolicemen in the building when he took charge that morning and later\r\nordered other patrolmen from several districts to report to the\r\nbasement.[C5-106] At about 9 a.m. Deputy Chief Stevenson instructed\r\nall detectives within the building to remain for the transfer.[C5-107]\r\nSheriff Decker testified that his men were ready to receive Oswald at\r\nthe county jail from the early hours of Sunday morning.[C5-108]\r\n\r\nWith the patrolmen and reserve policemen available to him, Captain\r\nTalbert, on his own initiative, undertook to secure the basement\r\nof the police department building. He placed policemen outside the\r\nbuilding at the top of the Commerce Street ramp to keep all spectators\r\non the opposite side of Commerce Street. Later, Talbert directed\r\nthat patrolmen be assigned to all street intersections the transfer\r\nvehicle would cross along the route to the county jail.[C5-109] His\r\nmost significant security precautions, however, were steps designed to\r\nexclude unauthorized persons from the basement area.\r\n\r\nThe spacious basement of the Police and Courts Building contains, among\r\nother things, the jail office and the police garage. (See Commission\r\nExhibit No. 2179, p. 211.) The jail office, into which the jail\r\nelevator opens, is situated on the west side of an auto ramp cutting\r\nacross the length of the basement from Main Street, on the north side\r\nof the building, to Commerce Street, on the south side. From the foot\r\nof this ramp, on the east side, midway through the basement, a decline\r\nruns down a short distance to the =L=-shaped police garage. In addition\r\nto the auto ramp, five doors to the garage provide access to the\r\nbasement from the Police and Courts Building on the west side of the\r\ngarage and the attached Municipal Building on the east. Three of these\r\nfive doors provide access to three elevators opening into the garage,\r\ntwo for passengers near the central part of the garage and one for\r\nservice at the east end of the garage. A fourth door near the passenger\r\nelevator opens into the municipal building; the fifth door, at the\r\nCommerce Street side of the garage, opens into a sub-basement that is\r\nconnected with both buildings.[C5-110]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2179\r\n\r\nBASEMENT\r\n\r\nDALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT, DALLAS, TEXAS]\r\n\r\nShortly after 9 o’clock Sunday morning, policemen cleared the basement\r\nof all but police personnel. Guards were stationed at the top of the\r\nMain and Commerce Streets auto ramps leading down into the basement,\r\nat each of the five doorways into the garage, and at the double doors\r\nleading to the public hallway adjacent to the jail office. Then, Sgt.\r\nPatrick T. Dean, acting under instructions from Talbert, directed\r\n14 men in a search of the garage. Maintenance workers were directed\r\nto leave the area. The searchers examined the rafters, tops of air\r\nconditioning ducts, and every closet and room opening off the garage.\r\nThey searched the interior and trunk compartment of automobiles parked\r\nin the garage. The two passenger elevators in the central part of the\r\ngarage were not in service and the doors were shut and locked; the\r\nservice elevator was moved to the first floor, and the operator was\r\ninstructed not to return it to the basement.[C5-111]\r\n\r\nDespite the thoroughness with which the search was conducted, there\r\nstill existed one and perhaps two weak points in controlling access\r\nto the garage. Testimony did not resolve positively whether or not\r\nthe stairway door near the public elevators was locked both from the\r\ninside and outside as was necessary to secure it effectively.[C5-112]\r\nAnd although guards were stationed near the double doors, the hallway\r\nnear the jail office was accessible to people from inside the Police\r\nand Courts Building without the necessity of presenting identification.\r\nUntil seconds before Oswald was shot, newsmen hurrying to photograph\r\nOswald were able to run without challenge through those doors into the\r\nbasement.[C5-113]\r\n\r\nAfter the search had been completed, the police allowed news\r\nrepresentatives to reenter the basement area and gather along the\r\nentrance to the garage on the east side of the ramp. Later, the police\r\npermitted the newsmen to stand in front of the railing on the east side\r\nof the ramp leading to Main Street. The policemen deployed by Talbert\r\nand Dean had instructions to allow no one but identified news media\r\nrepresentatives into the basement. As before, the police accepted any\r\ncredentials that appeared authentic, though some officers did make\r\nspecial efforts to check for pictures and other forms of corroborating\r\nidentification. Many newsmen reported that they were checked on more\r\nthan one occasion while they waited in the basement. A small number did\r\nnot recall that their credentials were ever checked.[C5-114]\r\n\r\nShortly after his arrival on Sunday morning, Chief Curry issued\r\ninstructions to keep reporters and cameramen out of the jail office\r\nand to keep television equipment behind the railing separating the\r\nbasement auto ramp from the garage. Curry observed that in other\r\nrespects Captain Talbert appeared to have security measures in hand and\r\nallowed him to proceed on his own initiative. Batchelor and Stevenson\r\nchecked progress in the basement during the course of the morning,\r\nand the officials were generally satisfied with the steps Talbert had\r\ntaken.[C5-115]\r\n\r\nAt about 11 a.m., Deputy Chief Stevenson requested that Capt. O. A.\r\nJones of the forgery bureau bring all available detectives from the\r\nthird floor offices to the basement. Jones instructed the detectives\r\nwho accompanied him to the basement to line the walls on either side\r\nof the passageway cleared for the transfer party.[C5-116] According to\r\nDetective T. D. McMillon,\r\n\r\n    * * * Captain Jones explained to us that, when they brought\r\n    the prisoner out, that he wanted two lines formed and we were\r\n    to keep these two lines formed, you know, a barrier on either\r\n    side of them, kind of an aisle * * * for them to walk through,\r\n    and when they came down this aisle, we were to keep this line\r\n    intact and move along with them until the man was placed in the\r\n    car.[C5-117]\r\n\r\nWith Assistant Chief Batchelor’s permission, Jones removed\r\nphotographers who had gathered once again in the basement jail office.\r\nJones recalled that he instructed all newsmen along the Main Street\r\nramp to remain behind an imaginary line extending from the southeast\r\ncorner of the jail office to the railing on the east side of the ramp;\r\nother officers recalled that Jones directed the newsmen to move away\r\nfrom the foot of the Main Street ramp and to line up against the east\r\nrailing. In any event, newsmen were allowed to congregate along the\r\nfoot of the ramp after Batchelor observed that there was insufficient\r\nroom along the east of the ramp to permit all the news representatives\r\nto see Oswald as he was brought out.[C5-118]\r\n\r\nBy the time Oswald reached the basement, 40 to 50 newsmen and 70 to 75\r\npolice officers were assembled there. Three television cameras stood\r\nalong the railing and most of the newsmen were congregated in that\r\narea and at the top of the adjacent decline leading into the garage.\r\nA group of newsmen and police officers, best estimated at about 20,\r\nstood strung across the bottom of the Main Street ramp. Along the south\r\nwall of the passageway outside the jail office door were about eight\r\ndetectives, and three detectives lined the north wall. Two officers\r\nstood in front of the double doors leading into the passageway from the\r\ncorridor next to the jail office.[C5-119] (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n2634, p. 214.)\r\n\r\nBeginning Saturday night, the public had been kept informed of the\r\napproximate time of the transfer. At approximately 10:20 a.m. Curry\r\ntold a press conference that Oswald would be moved in an armored truck\r\nand gave a general description of other security precautions.[C5-120]\r\nApparently no newsmen were informed of the transfer route, however,\r\nand the route was not disclosed to the driver of the armored truck\r\nuntil the truck arrived at the Commerce Street exit at about 11:07\r\na.m.[C5-121] When they learned of its arrival, many of the remaining\r\nnewsmen who had waited on the third floor descended to the basement.\r\nShortly after, newsmen may have had another indication that the\r\ntransfer was imminent if they caught a glimpse through the glass\r\nwindows of Oswald putting on a sweater in Captain Fritz’ office.[C5-122]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2634\r\n\r\nScene in areaway outside jail office immediately before shooting\r\n(Sunday, November 24).]\r\n\r\nBecause the driver feared that the truck might stall if it had to start\r\nfrom the bottom of the ramp and because the overhead clearance appeared\r\nto be inadequate, Assistant Chief Batchelor had it backed only into the\r\nentranceway at the top of the ramp. Batchelor and others then inspected\r\nthe inside of the truck.[C5-123]\r\n\r\nWhen Chief Curry learned that the truck had arrived, he informed\r\nCaptain Fritz that security controls were in effect and inquired how\r\nlong the questioning of Oswald would continue. At this point, Fritz\r\nlearned for the first time of the plan to convey Oswald by armored\r\ntruck and immediately expressed his disapproval. He urged the use of an\r\nunmarked police car driven by a police officer, pointing out that this\r\nwould be better from the standpoint of both speed and maneuverability.\r\nCurry agreed to Fritz’ plan; the armored truck would be used as a\r\ndecoy. They decided that the armored truck would leave the ramp first,\r\nfollowed by a car which would contain only security officers. A police\r\ncar bearing Oswald would follow. After proceeding one block, the car\r\nwith Oswald would turn off and proceed directly to the county jail; the\r\narmored truck would follow a lead car to the jail along the previously\r\nagreed upon and more circuitous route.[C5-124]\r\n\r\nCaptain Fritz instructed Detectives C. W. Brown and C. N. Dhority and\r\na third detective to proceed to the garage and move the followup car\r\nand the transfer car into place on the auto ramp. He told Lt. Rio S.\r\nPierce to obtain another automobile from the basement and take up a\r\nlead position on Commerce Street.[C5-125] Deputy Chief Stevenson went\r\nback to the basement to inform Batchelor and Jones of the change in\r\nplans.[C5-126] Oswald was given his sweater, and then his right hand\r\nwas handcuffed to the left hand of Detective J. R. Leavelle.[C5-127]\r\nDetective T. L. Baker called the jail office to check on security\r\nprecautions in the basement and notify officials that the prisoner was\r\nbeing brought down.[C5-128]\r\n\r\nOn arriving in the basement, Pierce asked Sgts. James A. Putnam and\r\nBilly Joe Maxey to accompany him in the lead car. Since the armored\r\ntruck was blocking the Commerce Street ramp, it would be necessary to\r\ndrive out the Main Street ramp and circle the block to Commerce Street.\r\nMaxey sat on the back seat of Pierce’s car, and Putnam helped clear a\r\npath through reporters on the ramp so that Pierce could drive up toward\r\nMain Street. When the car passed by the reporters at about 11:20 a.m.,\r\nPutnam entered the car on the right front side. Pierce drove to the\r\ntop of the Main Street ramp and slowed momentarily as Patrolman Roy\r\nE. Vaughn stepped from his position at the top of the ramp toward the\r\nstreet to watch for traffic.[C5-129] After Pierce’s car left the garage\r\narea, Brown drove another police car out of the garage, moved part way\r\nup the Commerce Street ramp, and began to back down into position to\r\nreceive Oswald. Dhority also proceeded to drive the followup car into\r\nposition ahead of Brown.[C5-130]\r\n\r\nAs Pierce’s car started up the ramp at about 11:20 a.m., Oswald,\r\naccompanied by Captain Fritz and four detectives, arrived at the jail\r\noffice. Cameramen in the hallway of the basement took pictures of\r\nOswald through the interior glass windows of the jail office as he was\r\nled through the office to the exit.[C5-131] Some of these cameramen\r\nthen ran through the double doors near the jail office and squeezed\r\ninto the line which had formed across the Main Street ramp.[C5-132]\r\nStill others remained just inside the double doors or proceeded through\r\nthe double doors after Oswald and his escort emerged from the jail\r\noffice.[C5-133] (See Commission Exhibit No. 2177, p. 217.)\r\n\r\nWhen Fritz came to the jail office door, he asked if everything was\r\nready, and a detective standing in the passageway answered yes.[C5-134]\r\nSomeone shouted, “Here he comes!”; additional spotlights were turned on\r\nin the basement, and the din increased. A detective stepped from the\r\njail office and proceeded toward the transfer car. Seconds later Fritz\r\nand then Oswald, with Detective Leavelle at his right, Detective L. C.\r\nGraves at his left, and Detective L. D. Montgomery at his rear, came\r\nthrough the door. Fritz walked to Brown’s car, which had not yet backed\r\nfully into position; Oswald followed a few feet behind. Newsmen near\r\nthe double door moved forward after him.[C5-135] Though movie films\r\nand video tapes indicate that the front line of newsmen along the Main\r\nStreet ramp remained fairly stationary, it was the impression of many\r\nwho were close to the scene that with Oswald’s appearance the crowd\r\nsurged forward. According to Detective Montgomery, who was walking\r\ndirectly behind Oswald, “as soon as we came out this door * * * this\r\nbunch here just moved in on us.”[C5-136] To Detective B. H. Combest,\r\nstanding on the Commerce Street side of the passageway from the jail\r\noffice door, it appeared that\r\n\r\n    Almost the whole line of people pushed forward when Oswald\r\n    started to leave the jail office, the door, the hall--all the\r\n    newsmen were poking their sound mikes across to him and asking\r\n    questions, and they were everyone sticking their flashbulbs up\r\n    and around and over him and in his face.[C5-137]\r\n\r\nAfter Oswald had moved about 10 feet from the door of the jail office,\r\nJack Ruby passed between a newsman and a detective at the edge of the\r\nstraining crowd on the Main Street ramp. With his right hand extended\r\nand holding a .38 caliber revolver, Ruby stepped quickly forward\r\nand fired a single fatal bullet into Oswald’s abdomen.[C5-138] (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 2636, p. 218.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE ASSISTANCE TO JACK RUBY IN ENTERING THE BASEMENT\r\n\r\nThe killing of Lee Harvey Oswald in the basement of police headquarters\r\nin the midst of more than 70 police officers gave rise to immediate\r\nspeculation that one or more members of the police department provided\r\nJack Ruby assistance which had enabled him to enter the basement and\r\napproach within a few feet of the accused Presidential assassin. In\r\nchapter VI, the Commission has considered whether there is any evidence\r\nlinking Jack Ruby with a conspiracy to kill the President. At this\r\npoint, however, it is appropriate to consider whether there is evidence\r\nthat Jack Ruby received assistance from Dallas policemen or others\r\nin gaining access to the basement on the morning of November 24. An\r\naffirmative answer would require that the evidence be evaluated for\r\npossible connection with the assassination itself. While the Commission\r\nhas found no evidence that Ruby received assistance from any person in\r\nentering the basement, his means of entry is significant in evaluating\r\nthe adequacy of the precautions taken to protect Oswald.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2177\r\n\r\nJAIL OFFICE AND IMMEDIATE VICINITY\r\n\r\nBASEMENT, DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2636\r\n\r\nRuby shooting Oswald (Sunday, November 24).]\r\n\r\nAlthough more than a hundred policemen and newsmen were present in\r\nthe basement of police headquarters during the 10 minutes before the\r\nshooting of Oswald, none has been found who definitely observed Jack\r\nRuby’s entry into the basement. After considering all the evidence,\r\nthe Commission has concluded that Ruby entered the basement unaided,\r\nprobably via the Main Street ramp, and no more than 3 minutes before\r\nthe shooting of Oswald.\r\n\r\nRuby’s account of how he entered the basement by the Main Street ramp\r\nmerits consideration in determining his means of entry. Three Dallas\r\npolicemen testified that approximately 30 minutes after his arrest,\r\nRuby told them that he had walked to the top of the Main Street ramp\r\nfrom the nearby Western Union office and that he walked down the\r\nramp at the time the police car driven by Lieutenant Pierce emerged\r\ninto Main Street.[C5-139] This information did not come to light\r\nimmediately because the policemen did not report it to their superiors\r\nuntil some days later.[C5-140] Ruby refused to discuss his means of\r\nentry in interrogations with other investigators later on the day of\r\nhis arrest.[C5-141] Thereafter, in a lengthy interview on December 21\r\nand in a sworn deposition taken after his trial, Ruby gave the same\r\nexplanation he had given to the three policemen.[C5-142]\r\n\r\nThe Commission has been able to establish with precision the time\r\nof certain events leading up to the shooting. Minutes before Oswald\r\nappeared in the basement, Ruby was in the Western Union office located\r\non the same block of Main Street some 350 feet from the top of the\r\nMain Street ramp. The time stamp on a money order which he sent and\r\non the receipt found in his pocket establish that the order was\r\naccepted for transmission at almost exactly 11:17 a.m. Ruby was then\r\nobserved to depart the office walking in the direction of the police\r\nbuilding.[C5-143] Video tapes taken without interruption before the\r\nshooting establish that Lieutenant Pierce’s car cleared the crowd\r\nat the foot of the ramp 55 seconds before the shooting. They also\r\nshow Ruby standing at the foot of the ramp on the Main Street side\r\nbefore the shooting.[C5-144] (See Commission Exhibit No. 2635, p.\r\n220.) The shooting occurred very close to 11:21 a.m. This time has\r\nbeen established by observing the time on a clock appearing in motion\r\npictures of Oswald in the basement jail office, and by records giving\r\nthe time of Oswald’s departure from the city jail and the time at which\r\nan ambulance was summoned for Oswald.[C5-145]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2635\r\n\r\nRuby in basement (extreme right) immediately before shooting (Sunday,\r\nNovember 24).]\r\n\r\nThe Main Street ramp provided the most direct route to the basement\r\nfrom the Western Union office. At normal stride, it requires\r\napproximately 1 minute to walk from that office to the top of the Main\r\nStreet ramp and about 20-25 seconds to descend the ramp.[C5-146] It is\r\ncertain, therefore, that Ruby entered the basement no more than 2-3\r\nminutes before the shooting. This timetable indicates that a little\r\nmore than 2 of the 4 minutes between Ruby’s departure from the Western\r\nUnion office and the time of the shooting are unaccounted for. Ruby\r\ncould have consumed this time in loitering along the way, at the top of\r\nthe ramp, or inside the basement. However, if Ruby is correct that he\r\npassed Pierce’s car at the top of the ramp, he could have been in the\r\nbasement no more than 30 seconds before the shooting.[C5-147]\r\n\r\nThe testimony of two witnesses partially corroborates Ruby’s claim\r\nthat he entered by the Main Street ramp. James Turner, an employee\r\nof WBAP-TV Fort Worth, testified that while he was standing near\r\nthe railing on the east side of the Main Street ramp, perhaps 30\r\nseconds before the shooting, he observed a man he is confident was\r\nJack Ruby moving slowly down the Main Street ramp about 10 feet from\r\nthe bottom.[C5-148] Two other witnesses testified that they thought\r\nthey had seen Ruby on the Main Street side of the ramp before the\r\nshooting.[C5-149]\r\n\r\nOne other witness has testified regarding the purported movements\r\nof a man on the Main Street ramp, but his testimony merits little\r\ncredence. A former police officer, N. J. Daniels, who was standing at\r\nthe top of the ramp with the single patrolman guarding this entrance,\r\nR. E. Vaughn, testified that “3 or 4 minutes, I guess”[C5-150] before\r\nthe shooting, a man walked down the Main Street ramp in full view of\r\nVaughn but was not stopped or questioned by the officer. Daniels did\r\nnot identify the man as Ruby. Moreover, he gave a description which\r\ndiffered in important respects from Ruby’s appearance on November 24,\r\nand he has testified that he doesn’t think the man was Ruby.[C5-151]\r\nOn November 24, Vaughn telephoned Daniels to ask him if he had seen\r\nanybody walk past him on the morning of the 24th and was told that he\r\nhad not; it was not until November 29 that Daniels came forward with\r\nthe statement that he had seen a man enter.[C5-152]\r\n\r\nAlthough the sum of this evidence tends to support Ruby’s claim that\r\nhe entered by the Main Street ramp, there is other evidence not fully\r\nconsistent with Ruby’s story. Patrolman Vaughn stated that he checked\r\nthe credentials of all unknown persons seeking to enter the basement,\r\nand his testimony was supported by several persons.[C5-153] Vaughn\r\ndenied that the emergence of Lieutenant Pierce’s car from the building\r\ndistracted him long enough to allow Ruby to enter the ramp unnoticed,\r\nand neither he nor any of the three officers in Lieutenant Pierce’s car\r\nsaw Ruby enter.[C5-154]\r\n\r\nDespite Vaughn’s denial the Commission has found no credible evidence\r\nto support any other entry route. Two Dallas detectives believed\r\nthey observed three men pushing a WBAP-TV camera into the basement\r\nminutes before the shooting, while only two were with the camera after\r\nOswald had been shot.[C5-155] However, films taken in the basement\r\nshow the WBAP-TV camera being pushed past the detectives by only two\r\nmen.[C5-156] The suspicion of the detectives is probably explained by\r\ntestimony that a third WBAP-TV employee ran to help steady the incoming\r\ncamera as it entered the basement, probably just before the camera\r\nbecame visible on the films.[C5-157] Moreover, since the camera entered\r\nthe basement close to 4 minutes before the shooting,[C5-158] it is\r\nvirtually impossible that Ruby could have been in the basement at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe possibility that Ruby entered the basement by some other route\r\nhas been investigated, but the Commission has found no evidence to\r\nsupport it. Ruby could have walked from the Western Union office to\r\nthe Commerce Street ramp on the other side of the building in about 2½\r\nminutes.[C5-159] However, during the minutes preceding the shooting\r\nvideo tapes show the armored truck in the entranceway to this ramp\r\nwith only narrow clearance on either side. (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n2710, p. 223.) Several policemen were standing near the truck and a\r\nlarge crowd of spectators was gathered across the street.[C5-160] It is\r\nimprobable that Ruby could have squeezed past the truck without having\r\nbeen observed. If Ruby entered by any other means, he would have had\r\nto pass first through the Police and Courts Building or the attached\r\nMunicipal Building, and then secondly through one of the five doors\r\ninto the basement, all of which, according to the testimony of police\r\nofficers, were secured. The testimony was not completely positive about\r\none of the doors.[C5-161]\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to support the speculations that Ruby used\r\na press badge to gain entry to the basement or that he concealed\r\nhimself in a police car. Police found no form of press card on Ruby’s\r\nperson after his apprehension, nor any discarded badges within the\r\nbasement.[C5-162] There is no evidence that any police officer admitted\r\nRuby on the pretense that he was a member of the press or any other\r\npretense.[C5-163]\r\n\r\nPolice vehicles in the basement were inspected during the course of\r\nthe search supervised by Sergeant Dean.[C5-164] According to Patrolman\r\nVaughn, the only vehicles that entered the basement while he was at the\r\ntop of the Main Street ramp were two patrol cars, one of which entered\r\ntwice, and a patrol wagon which was searched by another policeman\r\nafter it entered the basement. All entered on official police business\r\nand considerably more than 4 minutes before Oswald was shot.[C5-165]\r\nNone of the witnesses at the top of the Main Street ramp recalled any\r\npolice car entering the basement in the 4-minute period after Ruby\r\nleft the Western Union office and preceding the shooting.[C5-166] The\r\npossibility that Ruby could have entered the basement in a car may\r\ntherefore be completely discounted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2710]\r\n\r\nThe Dallas Police Department, concerned at the failure of its security\r\nmeasures, conducted an extensive investigation that revealed no\r\ninformation indicating complicity between any police officer and Jack\r\nRuby.[C5-167] Ruby denied to the Commission that he received any\r\nform of assistance.[C5-168] The FBI interviewed every member of the\r\npolice department who was on duty in the basement on November 24, and\r\nCommission staff members took sworn depositions from many. With few\r\nexceptions, newsmen who were present in the basement at the time also\r\ngave statements and/or depositions. As the record before the Commission\r\nindicated, Ruby had had rather free access to the Dallas police\r\nquarters during the period subsequent to the assassination, but there\r\nwas no evidence that implicated the police or newsmen in Ruby’s actions\r\non that day.[C5-169]\r\n\r\nRuby was known to have a wide acquaintanceship with Dallas policemen\r\nand to seek their favor. According to testimony from many sources, he\r\ngave free coffee at his clubs to many policemen while they were on\r\nduty and free admittance and discounts on beverages when they were off\r\nduty.[C5-170] Although Chief Curry’s estimate that approximately 25 to\r\n50 of the 1,175 men in the Dallas Police Department knew Ruby[C5-171]\r\nmay be too conservative, the Commission found no evidence of any\r\nsuspicious relationships between Ruby and any police officer.\r\n\r\nThe Commission found no substantial evidence that any member of the\r\nDallas Police Department recognized Jack Ruby as an unauthorized person\r\nin the basement prior to the time Sgt. P. T. Dean, according to his\r\ntestimony, saw Ruby dart forward toward Oswald. But Dean was then\r\npart way up the Commerce Street ramp, too far removed to act.[C5-172]\r\nPatrolman W. J. Harrison, Capt. Glen King, and reserve officers Capt.\r\nC. O. Arnett and Patrolman W. M. Croy were among those in front of\r\nRuby at the time Dean saw him. They all faced away from Ruby, toward\r\nthe jail office.[C5-173] Video tapes show that Harrison turned in the\r\ndirection of the ramp at the time Lieutenant Pierce’s car passed,\r\nand once again 25 seconds later, but there is no indication that he\r\nobserved or recognized Ruby.[C5-174] The policemen standing on the\r\nsouth side of the passageway from the jail office, who might have\r\nbeen looking in Ruby’s direction, had the glare of television and\r\nphotographer’s lights in their eyes.[C5-175]\r\n\r\nThe Commission also considered the possibility that a member of the\r\npolice department called Ruby at his apartment and informed him, either\r\nintentionally or unintentionally, of the time of the planned transfer.\r\nFrom at least 10:19 a.m., until close to 11 a.m., on Sunday, Ruby was\r\nat his apartment,[C5-176] where he could have received a call that the\r\ntransfer was imminent. He apparently left his apartment between 10:45\r\nand 11 a.m.[C5-177] However, the drive from Ruby’s apartment to the\r\nWestern Union office takes approximately 15 minutes.[C5-178] Since\r\nthe time of the contemplated transfer could not have been known to\r\nanyone until a few minutes before 11:15 a.m., a precise time could not\r\nhave been conveyed to Ruby while he was at his apartment. Moreover,\r\nthe television and radio publicized the transfer plans throughout\r\nthe morning, obviating the need for Ruby to obtain information\r\nsurreptitiously.\r\n\r\n\r\nADEQUACY OF SECURITY PRECAUTIONS\r\n\r\nThe shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald obviously resulted from the failure\r\nof the security precautions which the Dallas Police Department had\r\ntaken to protect their prisoner. In assessing the causes of the\r\nsecurity failure, the Commission has not overlooked the extraordinary\r\ncircumstances which prevailed during the days that the attention of the\r\nworld was turned on Dallas. Confronted with a unique situation, the\r\nDallas police took special security measures to insure Oswald’s safety.\r\nUnfortunately these did not include adequate control of the great crowd\r\nof newsmen that inundated the police department building.\r\n\r\nThe Dallas police had in custody a man whose alleged act had brought\r\nupon him immediate and universal opprobrium. There were many possible\r\nreasons why people might have attempted to kill him if given the\r\nopportunity. Concerned that there might be an attempt on Oswald’s life,\r\nFBI Director J. Edgar Hoover sent a message to Chief Curry on November\r\n22 through Special Agent Manning C. Clements of the FBI’s Dallas\r\noffice, urging that Oswald be afforded the utmost security. Curry does\r\nnot recall receiving the message.[C5-179]\r\n\r\nAlthough the presence of a great mass of press representatives\r\ncreated an extraordinary security problem in the building, the\r\npolice department pursued its normal policy of admitting the press.\r\nThat policy, set forth in General Order No. 81 of the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment, provided--\r\n\r\n    * * * that members of this Department render every assistance,\r\n    except such as obviously may seriously hinder or delay the\r\n    proper functioning of the Department, to the accredited\r\n    members of the official news-gathering agencies and this\r\n    includes newspaper, television cameramen and news-reel\r\n    photographers.[C5-180]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to all members of the police department, dated February 7,\r\n1963, Chief Curry explained the general order, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n    The General Order covering this subject is not merely\r\n    permissive. It does not state that the Officer may, if he\r\n    so chooses, assist the press. It rather places on him a\r\n    responsibility to lend active assistance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    * * * as a Department we deal with public affairs. It is the\r\n    right of the public to know about these affairs, and one of\r\n    the most accurate and useful avenues we have of supplying this\r\n    information is through the newspapers and radio and television\r\n    stations.\r\n\r\n    Implied in the General Order is a prohibition for the Officer\r\n    to improperly attempt to interfere with the news media\r\n    representative, who is functioning in his capacity as such.\r\n    Such activity on the part of any Police Officer is regarded\r\n    by the press as an infringement of rights, and the Department\r\n    shares this view.[C5-181]\r\n\r\nUnder this policy, news representatives ordinarily had access to the\r\nPolice and Courts Building. The first newsmen to arrive on Friday\r\nafternoon were admitted in accordance with the policy; others who\r\ncame later simply followed behind them. Shortly after Oswald arrived,\r\nCaptain King granted permission to bring television cameras to the\r\nthird floor.[C5-182] By the time the unwieldy proportions of the crowd\r\nof newsmen became apparent, it had already become well entrenched on\r\nthe third floor. No one suggested reversing the department’s policy\r\nexpressed in General Order No. 81. Chief Curry testified that at no\r\ntime did he consider clearing the crowd from the building; he “saw no\r\nparticular harm in allowing the media to observe the prisoner.”[C5-183]\r\nCaptain King later stated candidly that he simply became “accustomed to\r\nthe idea of them being out there.”[C5-184]\r\n\r\nThe general policy of the Dallas police recognized that the rule\r\nof full cooperation did not apply when it might jeopardize an\r\ninvestigation.[C5-185] In retrospect, most members of the department\r\nbelieved that the general rule allowing admittance of the press to the\r\npolice quarters should not have been followed after the assassination.\r\nFew, if any, thought this at the time.[C5-186] By failing to exclude\r\nthe press from the building on Friday and Saturday, the Dallas police\r\nmade it possible for the uncontrolled crowd to nearly surround Oswald\r\non the frequent occasions that he moved through the third floor\r\ncorridor. The decision to allow newsmen to observe the transfer on\r\nSunday followed naturally the policy established during these first 2\r\ndays of Oswald’s detention.\r\n\r\nThe reporters and cameramen descended upon the third floor of the\r\nPolice and Courts Building in such numbers that the pressroom on the\r\nthird floor proved wholly inadequate. Rather than the “two or three\r\nor maybe a half dozen reporters” who normally appeared to cover local\r\npolice stories,[C5-187] the police were faced with upward of 100.\r\nBringing with them cameras, microphones, cables, and spotlights, the\r\nnewsmen inevitably spilled over into areas where they interfered\r\nwith the transaction of police business and the maintenance of\r\nsecurity.[C5-188]\r\n\r\nAside from numbers, the gathering of reporters presented a problem\r\nbecause most of them were representatives of the national and foreign\r\npress, rather than the local press.[C5-189] These newsmen carried\r\nindividual press cards rather than identification cards issued by the\r\nDallas police. Therefore, it was impossible for the police to verify\r\nquickly the identity of this great number of unfamiliar people who\r\nappeared almost simultaneously.[C5-190] Because of the close physical\r\nproximity of the milling mass of insistent newsmen to the prisoner, the\r\nfailure to authenticate press credentials subjected the prisoner to a\r\nserious security risk.\r\n\r\nAlthough steps were taken on Friday afternoon to insure that persons\r\nseeking entry to the third floor were there for a legitimate purpose,\r\nreasons could be fabricated. Moreover, because of the large crowd,\r\nit was easier for unauthorized persons to slip by those guarding\r\nthe entrances. Jack Ruby, for one, was able to gain entry to the\r\nthird-floor corridor on Friday night.[C5-191]\r\n\r\nThe third-floor corridor provided the only passageway between the\r\nhomicide and robbery bureau and the jail elevator. No thought seems to\r\nhave been given, however, to the possibility of questioning Oswald on\r\nsome other floor.[C5-192] Moreover, Oswald’s most extended exposure to\r\nthe press, at the Friday evening press conference, was unrelated to any\r\nphase of the investigation and was motivated primarily by the desire to\r\nsatisfy the demands of the news media to see the prisoner.[C5-193] The\r\nrisks attendant upon this appearance were emphasized by the presence of\r\nunauthorized persons, including Jack Ruby, at the press conference in\r\nthe basement assembly room.[C5-194]\r\n\r\nAlthough Oswald was repeatedly exposed to possible assaults on Friday\r\nand Saturday, he met his death on Sunday, when police took the most\r\nextensive security precautions. The assembly of more than 70 police\r\nofficers, some of them armed with tear gas, and the contemplated use\r\nof an armored truck, appear to have been designed primarily to repel\r\nan attempt of a mob to seize the prisoner.[C5-195] Chief Curry’s own\r\ntestimony indicated that such a focus resulted not from any appraisal\r\nof the varied risks to Oswald’s life but came about in response to the\r\ntelephone threat Sunday morning that a hundred men were going to attack\r\nOswald.[C5-196]\r\n\r\nA more balanced appraisal would have given thought to protection\r\nagainst any attack. For example, the acceptance of inadequate press\r\ncredentials posed a clear avenue for a one-man assault. The likelihood\r\nof an unauthorized person obtaining entry by such means is confirmed\r\nnot alone by the fact that Jack Ruby managed to get by a guard at one\r\nentrance. Several newsmen related that their credentials were not\r\nchecked as they entered the basement Sunday morning. Seconds before\r\nOswald was shot, the double doors from the hallway next to the jail\r\noffice afforded a means of entry to the basement without presentation\r\nof credentials earlier demanded of newsmen.[C5-197]\r\n\r\nThe swarm of newspeople in the basement also substantially limited the\r\nability of the police to detect an unauthorized person, once he had\r\nentered the basement. While Jack Ruby might have been easily spotted\r\nif only police officers had been in the basement,[C5-198] he remained\r\napparently unnoticed in the crowd of newsmen until he lunged forward\r\ntoward Oswald. The near-blinding television and motion picture lights\r\nwhich were allowed to shine upon the escort party further increased the\r\ndifficulty of observing unusual movements in the basement.\r\n\r\nMoreover, by making public the plans for the transfer, the police\r\nattracted to the city jail many persons who otherwise might not\r\nhave learned of the move until it had been completed. This group\r\nincluded the onlookers gathered on Commerce Street and a few people\r\non Main Street. Also, continuous television and radio coverage of the\r\nactivities in the basement might have resulted in compromise of the\r\ntransfer operation.\r\n\r\nThese risks to Oswald’s safety, growing in part out of adherence to\r\nthe general policy of the police department, were also accepted for\r\nother reasons. Many members of the police department believed that the\r\nextraordinary public attention aroused by the tragic death of President\r\nKennedy obliged them to make special efforts to accommodate the press.\r\nCaptain King carefully articulated one reason why the newsmen were\r\npermitted\r\n\r\n    * * * to remain in the hallways, * * * to view the\r\n    investigation and to keep in constant touch with progress of\r\n    the investigation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    We realized that if we arrested a suspect, that if we brought\r\n    him into the police station and then conducted all of our\r\n    investigations behind closed doors, that if we gave no reports\r\n    on the progress of our investigation and did not permit the\r\n    newsmen to see the suspect--if we excluded them from it--we\r\n    would leave ourselves open not only to criticisms that we were\r\n    fabricating a suspect and were attempting to pin something on\r\n    someone, but even more importantly, we would cause people to\r\n    lose faith in our fairness and, through losing faith in our\r\n    fairness, to lose faith to a certain extent in the processes of\r\n    law.\r\n\r\n    We felt it was mandatory that as many people knew about it as\r\n    possible. We knew, too, that if we did exclude the newsmen,\r\n    we would be leaving ourselves open to a charge that we were\r\n    using improper action, duress, physical abuse, all of these\r\n    things.[C5-199]\r\n\r\nWhile Oswald was in custody, the Dallas police kept the press informed\r\nabout the treatment Oswald was receiving. The public could have been\r\nassured that the prisoner was not mistreated and that his rights\r\nwere fully respected by the police, without each one of hundreds\r\nof cameramen and reporters being permitted to satisfy himself that\r\nthe police had not abused the prisoner. This result could have been\r\naccomplished by obtaining reports from members of the family who\r\nvisited him, or by a committee of the bar or other substantial citizens\r\nof the community. When it became known on Saturday that Oswald did\r\nnot have an attorney, the president of the Dallas Bar Association\r\nvisited him to inquire whether he wished assistance in obtaining\r\ncounsel.[C5-200]\r\n\r\nMoreover, the right of the public to know does not give the press\r\nlicense to interfere with the efficient operation of law-enforcement\r\nagencies. Permitting the press to remain on the third floor of the\r\nbuilding served no valid purpose that could not have been met if the\r\npress had been excluded from the third floor, as it was from the fourth\r\nand fifth floors, and informed of developments either through press\r\nreleases or at press conferences elsewhere in the building.\r\n\r\nHaving failed to exclude the mass of the press from the basement during\r\nthe transfer of Oswald, the police department’s security measures could\r\nnot be completely effective. Despite the pressures that prevailed,\r\nplanning and coordination of security arrangements could have been\r\nmore thorough and precise. No single member of the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment ever assumed full responsibility for the details of Oswald’s\r\ntransfer.[C5-201] Chief Curry participated in some of the planning, but\r\nhe felt that primary authority for the transfer should be Fritz’, since\r\nFritz had charge of the investigation. According to Chief Curry--\r\n\r\n    Fritz and I, I think, discussed this briefly, the possibility\r\n    of getting that prisoner out of the city hall during the night\r\n    hours and by another route and slipping him to the jail, but\r\n    actually Fritz was not too much in favor of this and I more or\r\n    less left this up to Fritz as to when and how this transfer\r\n    would be made, because he has in the past transferred many of\r\n    his prisoners to the county jail and I felt that since it was\r\n    his responsibility, the prisoner was, to let him decide when\r\n    and how he wanted to transfer this prisoner.[C5-202]\r\n\r\nFritz, on the other hand, felt that Curry was directing the transfer\r\narrangements: “I was transferring him like the chief told me to\r\ntransfer him.”[C5-203] When Capt. W. B. Frazier notified Fritz by\r\ntelephone early Sunday morning about the threats to Oswald’s life,\r\nFritz replied that Curry should be notified, since he was handling\r\nthe transfer.[C5-204] When urged to modify the transfer plans to\r\navoid the press, as he later testified he would have preferred to do,\r\nFritz declined on the ground that Curry had already decided to the\r\ncontrary.[C5-205] Hence, if the recollection of both officials is\r\naccurate, the basic decision to move Oswald at an announced time and\r\nin the presence of the news media was never carefully thought through\r\nby either man. Curry and Fritz had agreed Saturday evening that Oswald\r\nshould not be moved at night, but their discussion apparently went\r\nlittle further.[C5-206]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the members of the Dallas Police Department were, as many\r\ntestified, accustomed to working together so that formal instructions\r\nwere sometimes unnecessary. On the other hand, it is clear, at least\r\nin retrospect, that this particular occasion demanded more than the\r\nusual informal unspoken understandings. The evidence indicates that no\r\nmember of the department at any time considered fully the implications\r\nof moving Oswald through the basement. Nor did any single official or\r\ngroup of officials coordinate and direct where the transfer vehicle\r\nwould be stationed to accept Oswald, where the press would stand, and\r\nthe number and positioning of police officers in the basement. Captain\r\nJones indicated that there were to be two solid lines of policemen from\r\nthe jail office door to the transfer vehicle,[C5-207] but lines were\r\nformed only along the walls of the areaway between the jail office\r\ndoor and the ramp. The newsmen were not kept east of the auto ramp\r\nwhere a railing would have separated them from Oswald. No strong ranks\r\nof policemen were ever placed in front of the newsmen once they were\r\nallowed to gather in the area of the Main Street ramp.[C5-208] Many\r\npolicemen in the basement did not know the function they were supposed\r\nto perform. No instructions were given that certain policemen should\r\nwatch the crowd rather than Oswald.[C5-209] Apparently no one gave any\r\nthought to the blinding effect of television and other camera lights\r\nupon the escort party.\r\n\r\nLargely on his own initiative, Captain Talbert undertook to secure the\r\nbasement, with only minimal coordination with those responsible for\r\nand familiar with the route Oswald would take through the basement.\r\nSeveral officials recalled that Lt. Woodrow Wiggins was directed to\r\nclear the basement jail office, but Wiggins testified that he received\r\nno such assignment.[C5-210] In any event, less than 20 minutes before\r\nthe transfer, Captain Jones observed newsmen in the jail office and had\r\nthem removed. But no official removed news personnel from the corridor\r\nbeside the jail office; indeed, cameramen took pictures through the\r\nglass windows of the jail office as Oswald walked through it toward\r\nthe basement, and then approached to within 20 feet of Oswald from\r\nthe rear at the same time that Jack Ruby moved toward Oswald from the\r\nfront.[C5-211]\r\n\r\nA clear example of the inadequacy of coordination was the last-minute\r\nchange in plans to transfer Oswald in an unmarked police car rather\r\nthan by armored truck.[C5-212] The plan to use an armored vehicle was\r\nadopted without informing Fritz. When Fritz was told of the arrangement\r\nshortly after 11 o’clock, he objected, and hurried steps were taken\r\nto modify the arrangements. Fritz was then prematurely informed that\r\nthe basement arrangements were complete. When Oswald and the escorting\r\ndetectives entered the basement, the transfer car had not yet been\r\nbacked into position, nor had the policemen been arranged to block the\r\nnewsmen’s access to Oswald’s path.[C5-213] If the transfer car had been\r\ncarefully positioned between the press and Oswald, Ruby might have been\r\nkept several yards from his victim and possibly without a clear view\r\nof him. Detective Leavelle, who accompanied Oswald into the basement,\r\ntestified:\r\n\r\n    * * * I was surprised when I walked to the door and the car was\r\n    not in the spot it should have been, but I could see it was in\r\n    back, and backing into position, but had it been in position\r\n    where we were told it would be, that would have eliminated\r\n    a lot of the area in which anyone would have access to him,\r\n    because it would have been blocked by the car. In fact, if the\r\n    car had been sitting where we were told it was going to be,\r\n    see--it would have been sitting directly upon the spot where\r\n    Ruby was standing when he fired the shot.[C5-214]\r\n\r\nCaptain Jones described the confusion with which Oswald’s entry into\r\nthe basement was in fact received:\r\n\r\n    Then the change--going to put two cars up there. There is no\r\n    reason why that back car can’t get all the way back to the jail\r\n    office. The original plan would be that the line of officers\r\n    would be from the jail door to the vehicle. Then they say,\r\n    “Here he comes.” * * * It is too late to get the people out of\r\n    the way of the car and form the line. I am aware that Oswald is\r\n    already coming because of the furor, so, I was trying to keep\r\n    everybody out of the way and keep the way clear and I heard a\r\n    shot.[C5-215]\r\n\r\nTherefore, regardless of whether the press should have been allowed to\r\nwitness the transfer, security measures in the basement for Oswald’s\r\nprotection could and should have been better organized and more\r\nthorough. These additional deficiencies were directly related to the\r\ndecision to admit newsmen to the basement. The Commission concludes\r\nthat the failure of the police to remove Oswald secretly or to control\r\nthe crowd in the basement at the time of the transfer were the major\r\ncauses of the security breakdown which led to Oswald’s death.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWS COVERAGE AND POLICE POLICY\r\n\r\nConsistent with its policy of allowing news representatives to remain\r\nwithin the working quarters of the Police and Courts Building, the\r\npolice department made every effort to keep the press fully informed\r\nabout the progress of the investigation. As a result, from Friday\r\nafternoon until after the killing of Oswald on Sunday, the press was\r\nable to publicize virtually all of the information about the case\r\nwhich had been gathered until that time. In the process, a great deal\r\nof misinformation was disseminated to a worldwide audience. (For some\r\nexamples see app. XII.)\r\n\r\nAs administrative assistant to Chief Curry, Captain King also handled\r\ndepartmental press relations and issued press releases. According to\r\nKing, it was “the responsibility of each member of the department\r\nto furnish to the press information on incidents in which they,\r\nthemselves, were involved, except on matters which involved * *\r\n* personnel policies of the department, or * * * unless it would\r\nobviously interfere with an investigation underway.”[C5-216] In\r\nOswald’s case, Chief Curry released most of the information to the\r\npress. He and Assistant Chief Batchelor agreed on Friday that Curry\r\nwould make all announcements to the press.[C5-217] However, there is no\r\nevidence that this decision was ever communicated to the rest of the\r\npolice force. The chief consequence appears to have been that Batchelor\r\nrefrained from making statements to the news media during this period.\r\n\r\nMost of the information was disclosed through informal oral statements\r\nor answers to questions at impromptu and clamorous press conferences in\r\nthe third floor corridor. Written press releases were not employed. The\r\nambulatory press conference became a familiar sight during these days.\r\nWhenever Curry or other officials appeared in the hallway, newsmen\r\nsurrounded them, asking questions and requesting statements. Usually\r\nthe officials complied. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2632, p. 232.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2632\r\n\r\nPress interview with Chief Curry in third floor corridor.]\r\n\r\nCurry appeared in interviews on television and radio at least a\r\ndozen times during November 22-24. He did not attend any of the\r\ninterrogations of Oswald in Captain Fritz’ office except at the\r\nbeginning and toward the end of Sunday morning’s session; he received\r\nhis information through Captain Fritz and other sources.[C5-218]\r\nNevertheless, in sessions with the newsmen on Friday and Saturday he\r\ngave detailed information on the progress of the case against Oswald.\r\nRecorded statements of television and radio interviews with Curry and\r\nother officials in Dallas during November 22-24 have been transcribed\r\nand included in the record compiled by the Commission.[C5-219] An\r\nexample of these interviews is the following transcript of remarks made\r\nby Curry to newsmen on Saturday:\r\n\r\n    Q. Chief Curry, I understand you have some new information in\r\n    this case. Could you relate what that is?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, we’ve just been informed by the Federal Bureau of\r\n    Investigation, that they, the FBI, have the order letter from\r\n    a mail order house, and the order was sent to their laboratory\r\n    in Washington and the writing on this order was compared with\r\n    known samples of our suspect, Oswald’s handwriting and found to\r\n    be the same.\r\n\r\n    Q. This order was for the rifle?\r\n\r\n    A. This order was for the rifle to a mail order house in\r\n    Chicago. It was [inaudible]. The return address was to Dallas,\r\n    Texas, to the post office box under the name of A. Hidell,\r\n    H-I-D-E-double L. This is the post office box of our suspect.\r\n    This gun was mailed parcel post March 20, 1963. I understand\r\n    he left Dallas shortly after this and didn’t come back until I\r\n    think about two months ago.\r\n\r\n    Q. Do you know again on what date this rifle was ordered and\r\n    are you able to link it definitely as the rifle which you\r\n    confiscated at the School Book Depository?\r\n\r\n    A. That we have not done so far. If the FBI has been able to do\r\n    it I have not been informed of it yet. We do know that this man\r\n    ordered a rifle of the type that was used in the assassination\r\n    of the President from this mail order house in Chicago and\r\n    the FBI has definitely identified the writing as that of our\r\n    suspect.\r\n\r\n    Q. On another subject--I understand you have photographs of\r\n    the suspect, Oswald, with a rifle like that used. Could you\r\n    describe that picture?\r\n\r\n    A. This is the picture of Oswald standing facing a camera with\r\n    a rifle in his hand which is very similar to the rifle that we\r\n    have in our possession. He also had a pistol strapped on his\r\n    hip. He was holding two papers in his hand, with one of them\r\n    seemed to be The Worker and the other says Be Militant--I\r\n    don’t know whether that was headlines or the name of the paper.\r\n\r\n    Q. How much did the gun cost from the mail order house?\r\n\r\n    A. I understand the gun was advertised for $12.78, I believe.\r\n\r\n    Q. Have you received any results on the ballistics test\r\n    conducted on the gun and on Oswald?\r\n\r\n    A. They’re going to be favorable. I don’t have a formal report\r\n    yet.\r\n\r\n    Q. But you are sure at this time they will be favorable?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes.\r\n\r\n    Q. Do you feel now that you have the case completely wrapped\r\n    up, or are you continuing?\r\n\r\n    A. We will continue as long as there is a shred of evidence to\r\n    be gathered. We have a strong case at this time.\r\n\r\n    Q. I believe you said earlier this afternoon that you have a\r\n    new development which does wrap up the case--the first time you\r\n    said the case definitely is secure. Is that correct?\r\n\r\n    A. That was this morning. This additional evidence just makes a\r\n    stronger case.\r\n\r\n    Q. But this is not the same evidence you were referring to then?\r\n\r\n    A. No, that’s true.\r\n\r\n    Q. Would you be willing to say what that evidence was?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir. I don’t wish to reveal it. It might jeopardize our\r\n    case.\r\n\r\n    Commentator: Thank you very much Chief Jesse Curry of the\r\n    Dallas Police Department.[C5-220]\r\n\r\nAlthough Captain Fritz permitted himself to be interviewed by the\r\nnews media less frequently than did Chief Curry, he nevertheless\r\nanswered questions and ventured opinions about the progress of the\r\ninvestigation. On Saturday he told reporters that he was convinced\r\nbeyond a doubt that Oswald had killed the President. He discussed some\r\nof the evidence in the case, especially the rifle, but his contribution\r\nto the knowledge of the reporters was small compared with that of Chief\r\nCurry.[C5-221]\r\n\r\nMany other members of the police department, including high\r\nofficials, detectives, and patrolmen, were also interviewed by news\r\nrepresentatives during these days.[C5-222] Some of these men had\r\nparticipated in specific aspects of the case, such as the capture of\r\nOswald at the Texas Theatre and the search for evidence at the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository Building. Few, if any, seemed reluctant to\r\nsubmit to questions and to being televised. It seemed to District\r\nAttorney Wade that the newsmen “just followed everybody everywhere they\r\nwent * * * they interviewed some of your patrolmen * * * on the corner\r\n* * * they were interviewing anybody.”[C5-223]\r\n\r\nWade himself also made several statements to the press. He visited\r\npolice headquarters twice on Friday, twice on Saturday, and twice on\r\nSunday. On most of these occasions he was interviewed by the press\r\nand appeared on television.[C5-224] After Oswald had appeared before\r\nthe press on Friday night, Wade held an impromptu conference with\r\nreporters in the overflowing assembly room.[C5-225] Wade told the\r\npress on Saturday that he would not reveal any evidence because it\r\nmight prejudice the selection of a jury.[C5-226] On other occasions,\r\nhowever, he mentioned some items of evidence and expressed his opinions\r\nregarding Oswald’s guilt. He told the press on Friday night that\r\nOswald’s wife had told the police that her husband had a rifle in the\r\ngarage at the house in Irving and that it was missing the morning of\r\nthe assassination. On one occasion he repeated the error that the\r\nmurder rifle had been a Mauser. Another time, he stated his belief that\r\nOswald had prepared for the assassination months in advance, including\r\nwhat he would tell the police. He also said that Oswald had practiced\r\nwith the rifle to improve his marksmanship.[C5-227]\r\n\r\nThe running commentary on the investigation by the police inevitably\r\ncarried with it the disclosure of many details that proved to be\r\nerroneous. In their efforts to keep the public abreast of the\r\ninvestigation, the police reported hearsay items and unverified\r\nleads; further investigation proved many of these to be incorrect or\r\ninaccurate. For example, the rifle found on the sixth floor of the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building was initially identified as a\r\nMauser 7.65 rather than a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5 because a deputy\r\nconstable who was one of the first to see it thought it looked like a\r\nMauser. He neither handled the weapon nor saw it at close range.[C5-228]\r\n\r\nPolice sources were also responsible for the mistaken notion that the\r\nchicken bones found on the sixth floor were the remains of Oswald’s\r\nlunch. They had in fact been left by another employee who ate his lunch\r\nthere at least 15 minutes before the assassination.[C5-229] Curry\r\nrepeated the erroneous report that a Negro had picked up Oswald near\r\nthe scene of the assassination and driven him across town.[C5-230]\r\nIt was also reported that the map found in Oswald’s room contained a\r\nmarked route of the Presidential motorcade when it actually contained\r\nmarkings of places where Oswald may have applied for jobs, including,\r\nof course, the Texas School Book Depository.[C5-231]\r\n\r\nConcern about the effects of the unlimited disclosures was being\r\nvoiced by Saturday morning. According to District Attorney Wade,\r\nhe received calls from lawyers in Dallas and elsewhere expressing\r\nconcern about providing an attorney for Oswald and about the amount of\r\ninformation being given to the press by the police and the district\r\nattorney.[C5-232] Curry continued to answer questions on television and\r\nradio during the remainder of the day and Sunday morning.[C5-233]\r\n\r\nFBI Director J. Edgar Hoover became concerned because “almost as\r\nsoon as * * * [FBI Laboratory reports] would reach the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment, the chief of police or one of the representatives of the\r\ndepartment would go on TV or radio and relate findings of the FBI,\r\ngiving information such as the identification of the gun and other\r\nitems of physical evidence.”[C5-234] On Sunday, after Oswald was\r\nshot, Hoover dispatched a personal message to Curry requesting him\r\n“not to go on the air any more until this case * * * [is] resolved.”\r\nHoover testified later that Curry agreed not to make any more\r\nstatements.[C5-235]\r\n\r\nThe shooting of Oswald shocked the Dallas police, and after the\r\ninterviews that immediately followed the shooting they were disposed\r\nto remain silent. Chief Curry made only one more television appearance\r\nafter the shooting. At 1:30 p.m., he descended to the assembly room\r\nwhere, tersely and grimly, he announced Oswald’s death. He refused to\r\nanswer any of the questions shouted at him by the persistent reporters,\r\nconcluding the conference in less than a minute.[C5-236]\r\n\r\nDistrict Attorney Wade also held one more press conference. Before\r\ndoing so on Sunday evening, he returned once more to the police\r\nstation and held a meeting with “all the brass” except Curry. Wade\r\ntold them that “people are saying * * * you had the wrong man and you\r\nall were the one who killed him or let him out here to have him killed\r\nintentionally.” Wade told the police that “somebody ought to go out in\r\ntelevision and lay out the evidence that you had on Oswald, and tell\r\nthem everything.” He sat down and listed from memory items of evidence\r\nin the case against Oswald. According to Wade, Chief Curry refused to\r\nmake any statements because he had told an FBI inspector that he would\r\nsay no more. The police refused to furnish Wade with additional details\r\nof the case.[C5-237]\r\n\r\nWade nonetheless proceeded to hold a lengthy formal press conference\r\nthat evening, in which he attempted to list all of the evidence that\r\nhad been accumulated at that point tending to establish Oswald as the\r\nassassin of President Kennedy. Unfortunately, at that time, as he\r\nsubsequently testified, he lacked a thorough grasp of the evidence and\r\nmade a number of errors.[C5-238] He stated that Oswald had told a woman\r\non a bus that the President had been killed, an error apparently caused\r\nby the busdriver having confused Oswald with another passenger who was\r\non the bus after Oswald had left. Wade also repeated the error about\r\nOswald’s having a map marked with the route of the motorcade. He told\r\nreporters that Oswald’s description and name “went out by the police\r\nto look for him.”[C5-239] The police never mentioned Oswald’s name in\r\ntheir broadcast descriptions before his arrest.[C5-240]\r\n\r\nWade was innocent of one error imputed to him since November 24.\r\nThe published transcript of part of the press conference furnished\r\nto newspapers by the Associated Press represented Wade as having\r\nidentified the cabdriver who took Oswald to North Beckley Avenue\r\nafter the shooting, as one named “Darryl Click.” The transcript as it\r\nappeared in the New York Times and the Washington Post of November 26,\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n    A. [Wade] a lady. He then--the bus, he asked the bus driver to\r\n    stop, got off at a stop, caught a taxicab driver, Darryl Click.\r\n    I don’t have his exact place--and went to his home in Oak\r\n    Cliff, changed his clothes hurriedly, and left.[C5-241]\r\n\r\nThe correct transcript of the press conference, taken from an audio\r\ntape supplied by station WBAP, Fort Worth, is as follows:\r\n\r\n    A. [Wade] A lady. He then--the bus, he asked the bus driver to\r\n    stop, got off at a stop, caught a taxicab driver.\r\n\r\n    Q. Where?\r\n\r\n    A. In Oak Cliff. I don’t have the exact place--and went to\r\n    his home in Oak Cliff, changed his clothes hurriedly and\r\n    left.[C5-242]\r\n\r\nIn this manner, a section of Dallas, “Oak Cliff,” became a nonexistent\r\ntaxicab driver, “Darryl Click.” Wade did not mention the cabdriver\r\nby name at any time. In transcribing the conference from the sound\r\ntape, a stenographer apparently made an error that might have become\r\npermanently imbedded in the literature of the event but for the\r\npreservation and use of an original sound tape.\r\n\r\nThough many of the inaccuracies were subsequently corrected by the\r\npolice and are negated by findings of the Commission included elsewhere\r\nin this report, the publicizing of unchecked information provided much\r\nof the basis for the myths and rumors that came into being soon after\r\nthe President’s death. The erroneous disclosures became the basis for\r\ndistorted reconstruction and interpretations of the assassination.\r\nThe necessity for the Dallas authorities to correct themselves or\r\nto be corrected by other sources gave rise not only to criticism of\r\nthe police department’s competence but also to doubts regarding the\r\nveracity of the police. Skeptics sought to cast doubt on much of the\r\ncorrect evidence later developed and to find support for their own\r\ntheories in these early police statements.\r\n\r\nThe immediate disclosure of information by the police created a further\r\nrisk of injuring innocent citizens by unfavorable publicity. This\r\nwas the unfortunate experience of Joe R. Molina, a Dallas-born Navy\r\nveteran who had been employed by the Texas School Book Depository\r\nsince 1947 and on November 22, 1963, held the position of credit\r\nmanager. Apparently because of Molina’s employment at the Depository\r\nand his membership in a veterans’ organization, the American G.I.\r\nForum, that the Dallas police considered possibly subversive, Dallas\r\npolicemen searched Molina’s home with his permission, at about 1:30\r\na.m., Saturday, November 23. During the day Molina was intermittently\r\ninterrogated at police headquarters for 6 or 7 hours, chiefly about his\r\nmembership in the American G.I. Forum, and also about Oswald. He was\r\nnever arrested, charged, or held in custody.[C5-243]\r\n\r\nWhile Molina was being questioned, officials of the police department\r\nmade statements or answered questions[C5-244] that provided the basis\r\nfor television reports about Molina during the day. These reports spoke\r\nof a “second suspect being picked up,” insinuated that the Dallas\r\npolice had reason to suspect another person who worked in the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository, stated that the suspect had been arrested and\r\nhis home searched, and mentioned that Molina may have been identified\r\nby the U.S. Department of Justice as a possible subversive.[C5-245]\r\n\r\nNo evidence was ever presented to link Molina with Oswald except as\r\na fellow employee of the Texas School Book Depository. According to\r\nMolina, he had never spoken to Oswald.[C5-246] The FBI notified the\r\nCommission that Molina had never been the subject of an investigation\r\nby it and that it had never given any information about Molina to\r\nthe Dallas police concerning any alleged subversive activities by\r\nhim.[C5-247] The Dallas police explained in a statement to the FBI that\r\nthey had never had a file on Molina, but that they did have one on the\r\nAmerican G.I. Forum.[C5-248]\r\n\r\nMolina lost his job in December. He felt that he was being discharged\r\nbecause of the unfavorable publicity he had received, but officials of\r\nthe Depository claimed that automation was the reason. Molina testified\r\nthat he had difficulty in finding another position, until finally, with\r\nthe help of a fellow church member, he secured a position at a lower\r\nsalary than his previous one.[C5-249]\r\n\r\nIf Oswald had been tried for his murders of November 22, the effects\r\nof the news policy pursued by the Dallas authorities would have proven\r\nharmful both to the prosecution and the defense. The misinformation\r\nreported after the shootings might have been used by the defense to\r\ncast doubt on the reliability of the State’s entire case. Though each\r\ninaccuracy can be explained without great difficulty, the number\r\nand variety of misstatements issued by the police shortly after the\r\nassassination would have greatly assisted a skillful defense attorney\r\nattempting to influence the attitudes of jurors.\r\n\r\nA fundamental objection to the news policy pursued by the Dallas\r\npolice, however, is the extent to which it endangered Oswald’s\r\nconstitutional right to a trial by an impartial jury. Because of the\r\nnature of the crime, the widespread attention which it necessarily\r\nreceived, and the intense public feelings which it aroused, it would\r\nhave been a most difficult task to select an unprejudiced jury, either\r\nin Dallas or elsewhere. But the difficulty was markedly increased\r\nby the divulgence of the specific items of evidence with which the\r\npolice linked Oswald to the two killings. The disclosure of evidence\r\nencouraged the public, from which a jury would ultimately be impaneled,\r\nto prejudge the very questions that would be raised at trial.\r\n\r\nMoreover, rules of law might have prevented the prosecution from\r\npresenting portions of this evidence to the jury. For example, though\r\nexpressly recognizing that Oswald’s wife could not be compelled to\r\ntestify against him, District Attorney Wade revealed to the Nation that\r\nMarina Oswald had affirmed her husband’s ownership of a rifle like that\r\nfound on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.[C5-250]\r\nCurry stated that Oswald had refused to take a lie detector test,\r\nalthough such a statement would have been inadmissible in a\r\ntrial.[C5-251] The exclusion of such evidence, however, would have been\r\nmeaningless if jurors were already familiar with the same facts from\r\nprevious television or newspaper reports. Wade might have influenced\r\nprospective jurors by his mistaken statement that the paraffin test\r\nshowed that Oswald had fired a gun. The tests merely showed that he had\r\nnitrate traces on his hands, which did not necessarily mean that he had\r\nfired either a rifle or a pistol.[C5-252]\r\n\r\nThe disclosure of evidence was seriously aggravated by the statements\r\nof numerous responsible officials that they were certain of Oswald’s\r\nguilt. Captain Fritz said that the case against Oswald was “cinched.”\r\nCurry reported on Saturday that “we are sure of our case.”[C5-253]\r\nCurry announced that he considered Oswald sane, and Wade told the\r\npublic that he would ask for the death penalty.[C5-254]\r\n\r\nThe American Bar Association declared in December 1963 that “widespread\r\npublicizing of Oswald’s alleged guilt, involving statements by\r\nofficials and public disclosures of the details of ‘evidence,’ would\r\nhave made it extremely difficult to impanel an unprejudiced jury and\r\nafford the accused a fair trial.”[C5-255] Local bar associations\r\nexpressed similar feelings.[C5-256] The Commission agrees that\r\nLee Harvey Oswald’s opportunity for a trial by 12 jurors free of\r\npreconception as to his guilt or innocence would have been seriously\r\njeopardized by the premature disclosure and weighing of the evidence\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nThe problem of disclosure of information and its effect on trials is,\r\nof course, further complicated by the independent activities of the\r\npress in developing information on its own from sources other than\r\nlaw enforcement agencies. Had the police not released the specific\r\nitems of evidence against Oswald, it is still possible that the other\r\ninformation presented on television and in the newspapers, chiefly of a\r\nbiographical nature, would itself have had a prejudicial effect on the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of the news policy adopted by the Dallas authorities,\r\nChief Curry observed that “it seemed like there was a great demand by\r\nthe general public to know what was going on.”[C5-257] In a prepared\r\nstatement, Captain King wrote:\r\n\r\n    At that time we felt a necessity for permitting the newsmen as\r\n    much latitude as possible. We realized the magnitude of the\r\n    incident the newsmen were there to cover. We realized that not\r\n    only the nation but the world would be greatly interested in\r\n    what occurred in Dallas. We believed that we had an obligation\r\n    to make as widely known as possible everything we could\r\n    regarding the investigation of the assassination and the manner\r\n    in which we undertook that investigation.[C5-258]\r\n\r\nThe Commission recognizes that the people of the United States, and\r\nindeed the world, had a deep-felt interest in learning of the events\r\nsurrounding the death of President Kennedy, including the development\r\nof the investigation in Dallas. An informed public provided the\r\nultimate guarantee that adequate steps would be taken to apprehend\r\nthose responsible for the assassination and that all necessary\r\nprecautions would be taken to protect the national security. It was\r\ntherefore proper and desirable that the public know which agencies were\r\nparticipating in the investigation and the rate at which their work\r\nwas progressing. The public was also entitled to know that Lee Harvey\r\nOswald had been apprehended and that the State had gathered sufficient\r\nevidence to arraign him for the murders of the President and Patrolman\r\nTippit, that he was being held pending action of the grand jury, that\r\nthe investigation was continuing, and that the law enforcement agencies\r\nhad discovered no evidence which tended to show that any other person\r\nwas involved in either slaying.\r\n\r\nHowever, neither the press nor the public had a right to be\r\ncontemporaneously informed by the police or prosecuting authorities\r\nof the details of the evidence being accumulated against Oswald.\r\nUndoubtedly the public was interested in these disclosures, but\r\nits curiosity should not have been satisfied at the expense of the\r\naccused’s right to a trial by an impartial jury. The courtroom, not the\r\nnewspaper or television screen, is the appropriate forum in our system\r\nfor the trial of a man accused of a crime.\r\n\r\nIf the evidence in the possession of the authorities had not been\r\ndisclosed, it is true that the public would not have been in a position\r\nto assess the adequacy of the investigation or to apply pressures for\r\nfurther official undertakings. But a major consequence of the hasty\r\nand at times inaccurate divulgence of evidence after the assassination\r\nwas simply to give rise to groundless rumors and public confusion.\r\nMoreover, without learning the details of the case, the public could\r\nhave been informed by the responsible authority of the general scope of\r\nthe investigation and the extent to which State and Federal agencies\r\nwere assisting in the police work.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITY OF NEWS MEDIA\r\n\r\nWhile appreciating the heavy and unique pressures with which the\r\nDallas Police Department was confronted by reason of the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy, primary responsibility for having failed to\r\ncontrol the press and to check the flow of undigested evidence to the\r\npublic must be borne by the police department. It was the only agency\r\nthat could have established orderly and sound operating procedures to\r\ncontrol the multitude of newsmen gathered in the police building after\r\nthe assassination.\r\n\r\nThe Commission believes, however, that a part of the responsibility\r\nfor the unfortunate circumstances following the President’s death\r\nmust be borne by the news media. The crowd of newsmen generally\r\nfailed to respond properly to the demands of the police. Frequently\r\nwithout permission, news representatives used police offices on the\r\nthird floor, tying up facilities and interfering with normal police\r\noperations. Police efforts to preserve order and to clear passageways\r\nin the corridor were usually unsuccessful. On Friday night the\r\nreporters completely ignored Curry’s injunction against asking Oswald\r\nquestions in the assembly room and crowding in on him. On Sunday\r\nmorning, the newsmen were instructed to direct no questions at Oswald;\r\nnevertheless, several reporters shouted questions at him when he\r\nappeared in the basement.[C5-259]\r\n\r\nMoreover, by constantly pursuing public officials, the news\r\nrepresentatives placed an insistent pressure, upon them to disclose\r\ninformation. And this pressure was not without effect, since the police\r\nattitude toward the press was affected by the desire to maintain\r\nsatisfactory relations with the news representatives and to create a\r\nfavorable image of themselves. Chief Curry frankly told the Commission\r\nthat\r\n\r\n    I didn’t order them out of the building, which if I had it\r\n    to do over I would. In the past like I say, we had always\r\n    maintained very good relations with our press, and they had\r\n    always respected us. * * * [C5-260]\r\n\r\nCurry refused Fritz’ request to put Oswald behind the screen in the\r\nassembly room at the Friday night press conference because this might\r\nhave hindered the taking of pictures.[C5-261] Curry’s subordinates had\r\nthe impression that an unannounced transfer of Oswald to the county\r\njail was unacceptable because Curry did not want to disappoint the\r\nnewsmen; he had promised that they could witness the transfer.[C5-262]\r\nIt seemed clear enough that any attempt to exclude the press from the\r\nbuilding or to place limits on the information disclosed to them would\r\nhave been resented and disputed by the newsmen, who were constantly and\r\naggressively demanding all possible information about anything related\r\nto the assassination.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Commission has found no corroboration in the video and\r\naudio tapes, police officials recall that one or two representatives of\r\nthe press reinforced their demands to see Oswald by suggesting that the\r\npolice had been guilty of brutalizing him. They intimated that unless\r\nthey were given the opportunity to see him, these suggestions would be\r\npassed on to the public.[C5-263] Captain King testified that he had\r\nbeen told that\r\n\r\n    A short time after Oswald’s arrest one newsman held up a\r\n    photograph and said, “This is what the man charged with the\r\n    assassination of the President looks like. Or at least this is\r\n    what he did look like. We don’t know what he looks like after\r\n    an hour in the custody of the Dallas Police Department.”[C5-264]\r\n\r\nCity Manager Elgin Crull stated that when he visited Chief Curry in\r\nhis office on the morning of November 23, Curry told him that he “felt\r\nit was necessary to cooperate with the news media representatives, in\r\norder to avoid being accused of using Gestapo tactics in connection\r\nwith the handling of Oswald.” Crull agreed with Curry.[C5-265] The\r\nCommission deems any such veiled threats to be absolutely without\r\njustification.\r\n\r\nThe general disorder in the Police and Courts Building during November\r\n22-24 reveals a regrettable lack of self-discipline by the newsmen.\r\nThe Commission believes that the news media, as well as the police\r\nauthorities, who failed to impose conditions more in keeping with the\r\norderly process of justice, must share responsibility for the failure\r\nof law enforcement which occurred in connection with the death of\r\nOswald. On previous occasions, public bodies have voiced the need\r\nfor the exercise of self-restraint by the news media in periods when\r\nthe demand for information must be tempered by other fundamental\r\nrequirements of our society.\r\n\r\nAt its annual meeting in Washington in April 1964, the American\r\nSociety of Newspaper Editors discussed the role of the press in Dallas\r\nimmediately after President Kennedy’s assassination. The discussion\r\nrevealed the strong misgivings among the editors themselves about the\r\nrole that the press had played and their desire that the press display\r\nmore self-discipline and adhere to higher standards of conduct in the\r\nfuture.[C5-266] To prevent a recurrence of the unfortunate events which\r\nfollowed the assassination, however, more than general concern will be\r\nneeded. The promulgation of a code of professional conduct governing\r\nrepresentatives of all news media would be welcome evidence that the\r\npress had profited by the lesson of Dallas.\r\n\r\nThe burden of insuring that appropriate action is taken to establish\r\nethical standards of conduct for the news media must also be borne,\r\nhowever, by State and local governments, by the bar, and ultimately\r\nby the public. The experience in Dallas during November 22-24 is a\r\ndramatic affirmation of the need for steps to bring about a proper\r\nbalance between the right of the public to be kept informed and the\r\nright of the individual to a fair and impartial trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nInvestigation of Possible Conspiracy\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter sets forth the findings of the Commission as to whether\r\nLee Harvey Oswald had any accomplices in the planning or execution of\r\nthe assassination. Particularly after the slaying of Oswald by Jack\r\nRuby under the circumstances described in the preceding chapter, rumors\r\nand suspicions developed regarding the existence of a conspiracy to\r\nassassinate President Kennedy. As discussed in appendix XII, many of\r\nthese rumors were based on a lack of information as to the nature and\r\nextent of evidence that Oswald alone fired the shots which killed\r\nPresident Kennedy and wounded Governor Connally. Others of the more\r\nwidely publicized rumors maintained that Oswald must have received aid\r\nfrom one or more persons or political groups, ranging from the far\r\nleft to the far right of the political spectrum, or from a foreign\r\ngovernment, usually either the Castro regime in Cuba or the Soviet\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThe Commission faced substantial difficulties in determining whether\r\nanyone conspired with or assisted the person who committed the\r\nassassination. Prior to his own death Oswald had neither admitted his\r\nown involvement nor implicated any other persons in the assassination\r\nof the President. The problem of determining the existence or\r\nnonexistence of a conspiracy was compounded because of the possibility\r\nof subversive activity by a foreign power. Witnesses and evidence\r\nlocated in other countries were not subject to subpena, as they would\r\nhave been if they had been located in the United States. When evidence\r\nwas obtained from a foreign nation, it could not be appraised as\r\neffectively as if it had been derived from a domestic source. The\r\nCommission has given the closest scrutiny to all available evidence\r\nwhich related or might have related to a foreign country. All such\r\nevidence was tested, whenever possible, against the contingency that it\r\nhad been fabricated or slanted to mislead or confuse.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet its obligations fully, the Commission has investigated\r\neach rumor and allegation linking Oswald to a conspiracy which\r\nhas come to its attention, regardless of source. In addition,\r\nthe Commission has explored the details of Lee Harvey Oswald’s\r\nactivities and life, especially in the months immediately preceding\r\nthe assassination, in order to develop any investigative lead\r\nrelevant to the issue of conspiracy. All of Oswald’s known writings\r\nor other possessions which might have been used for code or other\r\nespionage purposes have been examined by either the Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation or the National Security Agency, or both agencies, to\r\ndetermine whether they were so used.[C6-1]\r\n\r\nIn setting forth the results of this investigation, the first section\r\nof this chapter reviews the facts related to the assassination itself,\r\npreviously considered in more detail in chapter IV. If any conspiracy\r\ndid exist, it might have manifested itself at some point during\r\nOswald’s preparation for the shooting, his execution of the plan, or\r\nhis escape from the scene of the assassination. The Commission has\r\ntherefore studied the precise means by which the assassination occurred\r\nfor traces of evidence that Oswald received any form of assistance in\r\neffecting the killing.\r\n\r\nThe second section of the chapter deals more broadly with Oswald’s life\r\nsince 1959. During the period following his discharge from the Marines\r\nin 1959, Oswald engaged in several activities which demand close\r\nscrutiny to determine whether, through these pursuits, he developed\r\nany associations which were connected with the planning or execution\r\nof the assassination. Oswald professed commitment to Marxist ideology;\r\nhe defected to the Soviet Union in 1959; he attempted to expatriate\r\nhimself and acquire Soviet citizenship; and he resided in the Soviet\r\nUnion until June of 1962. After his return to the United States he\r\nsought to maintain contacts with the Communist Party, Socialist Workers\r\nParty, and the Fair Play for Cuba Committee; he associated with various\r\nRussian-speaking citizens in the Dallas-Fort Worth area--some of whom\r\nhad resided in Russia; he traveled to Mexico City where he visited\r\nboth the Cuban and Soviet Embassies 7 weeks before the assassination;\r\nand he corresponded with the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. In\r\nview of these activities, the Commission has instituted a thorough\r\ninvestigation to determine whether the assassination was in some manner\r\ndirected or encouraged through contacts made abroad or through Oswald’s\r\npolitically oriented activities in this country. The Commission has\r\nalso considered whether any connections existed between Oswald and\r\ncertain right-wing activity in Dallas which, shortly before the\r\nassassination, led to the publication of hostile criticism of President\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\nThe final section of this chapter considers the possibility that Jack\r\nRuby was part of a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy. The\r\nCommission explored Ruby’s background and his activities in the months\r\nprior to the assassination, and especially his activities in the 2 days\r\nafter the assassination, in an effort to determine whether there was\r\nany indication that Ruby was implicated in that event. The Commission\r\nalso sought to ascertain the truth or falsity of assertions that Oswald\r\nand Ruby were known to one another prior to the assassination.\r\n\r\nIn considering the question of foreign involvement, the Commission\r\nhas received valuable assistance from the Department of State, the\r\nCentral Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and\r\nother Federal agencies with special competence in the field of foreign\r\ninvestigation. Some of the information furnished by these agencies is\r\nof a highly confidential nature. Nevertheless, because the disclosure\r\nof all facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy is of\r\ngreat public importance, the Commission has included in this report all\r\ninformation furnished by these agencies which the Commission relied\r\nupon in coming to its conclusions, or which tended to contradict those\r\nconclusions. Confidential sources of information, as contrasted with\r\nthe information itself, have, in a relatively few instances, been\r\nwithheld.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE ASSASSINATION\r\n\r\nEarlier chapters have set forth the evidence upon which the Commission\r\nconcluded that President Kennedy was fired upon from a single window\r\nin the southeast corner of the sixth floor of the Texas School\r\nBook Depository, and that Lee Harvey Oswald was the person who\r\nfired the shots from this point. As reflected in those chapters, a\r\ncertain sequence of events necessarily took place in order for the\r\nassassination to have occurred as it did. The motorcade traveled past\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository; Oswald had access to the sixth\r\nfloor of the building; Oswald brought the rifle into the building;\r\nthe cartons were arranged at the sixth-floor window; and Oswald\r\nescaped from the building before the police had sealed off the exits.\r\nAccordingly, the Commission has investigated these circumstances\r\nto determine whether Oswald received help from any other person in\r\nplanning or performing the shooting.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelection of Motorcade Route\r\n\r\nThe factors involved in the choice of the motorcade route by the Secret\r\nService have been discussed in chapter II of this report.[C6-2] It\r\nwas there indicated that after passing through a portion of suburban\r\nDallas, the motorcade was to travel west on Main Street, and then\r\nto the Trade Mart by way of the Stemmons Freeway, the most direct\r\nroute from that point. This route would take the motorcade along the\r\ntraditional parade route through downtown Dallas; it allowed the\r\nmaximum number of persons to observe the President; and it enabled the\r\nmotorcade to cover the distance from Love Field to the Trade Mart in\r\nthe 45 minutes allocated by members of the White House staff planning\r\nthe President’s schedule in Dallas. No member of the Secret Service,\r\nthe Dallas Police Department, or the local host committee who was\r\nconsulted felt that any other route would be preferable.\r\n\r\nTo reach Stemmons Freeway from Main Street, it was determined that\r\nthe motorcade would turn right from Main Street onto Houston Street\r\nfor one block and then left onto Elm Street, proceeding through the\r\nTriple Underpass to the Stemmons Freeway access road. This route took\r\nthe motorcade past the Texas School Book Depository Building on the\r\nnorthwest corner of Elm and Houston Streets. Because of the sharp turn\r\nat this corner, the motorcade also reduced its speed. The motorcade\r\nwould have passed approximately 90 yards further from the Depository\r\nBuilding and made no turn near the building if it had attempted to\r\nreach the Stemmons Freeway directly from Main Street. The road plan in\r\nDealey Plaza, however, is designed to prevent such a turn. In order to\r\nkeep motorists from reaching the freeway from Main Street, a concrete\r\nbarrier has been erected between Main and Elm Streets extending beyond\r\nthe freeway entrance. (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 2114-2116, pp.\r\n35-37.) Hence, it would have been necessary for the motorcade either\r\nto have driven over this barrier or to have made a sharp =S=-turn\r\nin order to have entered the freeway from Main Street. Selection\r\nof the motorcade route was thus entirely appropriate and based on\r\nsuch legitimate considerations as the origin and destination of the\r\nmotorcade, the desired opportunity for the President to greet large\r\nnumbers of people, and normal patterns of traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald’s Presence in the Depository Building\r\n\r\nOswald’s presence as an employee in the Texas School Book Depository\r\nBuilding was the result of a series of happenings unrelated to the\r\nPresident’s trip to Dallas. He obtained the Depository job after\r\nalmost 2 weeks of job hunting which began immediately upon his arrival\r\nin Dallas from Mexico on October 3, 1963.[C6-3] At that time he was\r\nin poor financial circumstances, having arrived from Mexico City\r\nwith approximately $133 or less,[C6-4] and with his unemployment\r\ncompensation benefits due to expire on October 8.[C6-5] Oswald and\r\nhis wife were expecting the birth of their second child, who was\r\nin fact born on October 20.[C6-6] In attempting to procure work,\r\nOswald utilized normal channels, including the Texas Employment\r\nCommission.[C6-7]\r\n\r\nOn October 4, 1963, Oswald applied for a position with Padgett Printing\r\nCorp., which was located at 1313 Industrial Boulevard, several blocks\r\nfrom President Kennedy’s parade route.[C6-8] Oswald favorably impressed\r\nthe plant superintendent who checked his prior job references, one\r\nof which was Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall, the firm where Oswald had done\r\nphotography work from October 1962 to April 1963.[C6-9] The following\r\nreport was written by Padgett’s plant superintendent on the reverse\r\nside of Oswald’s job application: “Bob Stovall does not recommend this\r\nman. He was released because of his record as a troublemaker.--Has\r\nCommunistic tendencies.”[C6-10] Oswald received word that Padgett\r\nPrinting had hired someone else.[C6-11]\r\n\r\nOswald’s employment with the Texas School Book Depository came about\r\nthrough a chance conversation on Monday, October 14, between Ruth\r\nPaine, with whom his family was staying while Oswald was living in\r\na roominghouse in Dallas, and two of Mrs. Paine’s neighbors.[C6-12]\r\nDuring a morning conversation over coffee, at which Marina Oswald was\r\npresent, Oswald’s search for employment was mentioned. The neighbors\r\nsuggested several places where Oswald might apply for work. One of\r\nthe neighbors present, Linnie Mae Randle, said that her brother had\r\nrecently been hired as a schoolbook order filler at the Texas School\r\nBook Depository and she thought the Depository might need additional\r\nhelp. She testified, “and of course you know just being neighborly and\r\neverything, we felt sorry for Marina because her baby was due right\r\naway as we understood it, and he didn’t have any work * * *.”[C6-13]\r\n\r\nWhen Marina Oswald and Mrs. Paine returned home, Mrs. Paine promptly\r\ntelephoned the Texas School Book Depository and spoke to Superintendent\r\nRoy Truly, whom she did not know.[C6-14] Truly agreed to interview\r\nOswald, who at the time was in Dallas seeking employment. When Oswald\r\ncalled that evening, Mrs. Paine told him of her conversation with\r\nTruly.[C6-15] The next morning Oswald went to the Texas School Book\r\nDepository where he was interviewed and hired for the position of order\r\nfiller.[C6-16]\r\n\r\nOn the same date, the Texas Employment Commission attempted to refer\r\nOswald to an airline company which was looking for baggage and cargo\r\nhandlers at a salary which was $100 per month higher than that offered\r\nby the Depository Co.[C6-17] The Employment Commission tried to advise\r\nOswald of this job at 10:30 a.m. on October 16, 1963. Since the records\r\nof the Commission indicate that Oswald was then working,[C6-18] it\r\nseems clear that Oswald was hired by the Depository Co. before the\r\nhigher paying job was available. It is unlikely that he ever learned of\r\nthis second opportunity.\r\n\r\nAlthough publicity concerning the President’s trip to Dallas appeared\r\nin Dallas newspapers as early as September 13, 1963, the planning of\r\nthe motorcade route was not started until after November 4, when the\r\nSecret Service was first notified of the trip.[C6-19] A final decision\r\nas to the route could not have been reached until November 14, when\r\nthe Trade Mart was selected as the luncheon site.[C6-20] Although\r\nnews reports on November 15 and November 16 might have led a person\r\nto believe that the motorcade would pass the Depository Building, the\r\nroute was not finally selected until November 18; it was announced\r\nin the press on November 19, only 3 days before the President’s\r\narrival.[C6-21] Based on the circumstances of Oswald’s employment and\r\nthe planning of the motorcade route, the Commission has concluded that\r\nOswald’s employment in the Depository was wholly unrelated to the\r\nPresident’s trip to Dallas.\r\n\r\n\r\nBringing Rifle Into Building\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the evidence developed in chapter IV the Commission\r\nconcluded that Lee Harvey Oswald carried the rifle used in the\r\nassassination into the Depository Building on Friday, November 22,\r\n1963, in the handmade brown paper bag found near the window from\r\nwhich the shots were fired.[C6-22] The arrangement by which Buell\r\nWesley Frazier drove Oswald between Irving and Dallas was an innocent\r\none, having commenced when Oswald first started working at the\r\nDepository.[C6-23] As noted above, it was Frazier’s sister, Linnie May\r\nRandle, who had suggested to Ruth Paine that Oswald might be able to\r\nfind employment at the Depository. When Oswald started working there,\r\nFrazier, who lived only a half block away from the Paines, offered to\r\ndrive Oswald to and from Irving whenever he was going to stay at the\r\nPaines’ home.[C6-24] Although Oswald’s request for a ride to Irving on\r\nThursday, November 21, was a departure from the normal weekend pattern,\r\nOswald gave the explanation that he needed to obtain curtain rods for\r\nan “apartment” in Dallas.[C6-25] This served also to explain the long\r\npackage which he took with him from Irving to the Depository Building\r\nthe next morning.[C6-26] Further, there is no evidence that Ruth Paine\r\nor Marina Oswald had reason to believe that Oswald’s return was in\r\nany way related to an attempt to shoot the President the next day.\r\nAlthough his visit was a surprise, since he arrived on Thursday instead\r\nof Friday for his usual weekend visit, both women testified that they\r\nthought he had come to patch up a quarrel which he had with his wife a\r\nfew days earlier when she learned that he was living in Dallas under an\r\nassumed name.[C6-27]\r\n\r\nIt has also been shown that Oswald had the opportunity to work in\r\nthe Paines’ garage on Thursday evening and prepare the rifle by\r\ndisassembling it, if it were not already disassembled, and packing\r\nit in the brown bag.[C6-28] It has been demonstrated that the paper\r\nand tape from which the bag was made came from the shipping room of\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository and that Oswald had access to this\r\nmaterial.[C6-29] Neither Ruth Paine nor Marina Oswald saw the paper\r\nbag or the paper and tape out of which the bag was constructed.[C6-30]\r\nIf Oswald actually prepared the bag in the Depository out of materials\r\navailable to him there, he could have concealed it in the jacket or\r\nshirt which he was wearing.[C6-31] The Commission has found no evidence\r\nwhich suggests that Oswald required or in fact received any assistance\r\nin bringing the rifle into the building other than the innocent\r\nassistance provided by Frazier in the form of the ride to work.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccomplices at the Scene of the Assassination\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of boxes at the window from which the shots were fired\r\nwas studied to determine whether Oswald required any assistance in\r\nmoving the cartons to the window. Cartons had been stacked on the\r\nfloor, a few feet behind the window, thus shielding Oswald from the\r\nview of anyone on the sixth floor who did not attempt to go behind\r\nthem.[C6-32] (See Commission Exhibit No. 723, p. 80.) Most of those\r\ncartons had been moved there by other employees to clear an area for\r\nlaying a new flooring on the west end of the sixth floor.[C6-33]\r\nSuperintendent Roy Truly testified that the floor-laying crew moved\r\na long row of books parallel to the windows on the south side\r\nand had “quite a lot of cartons” in the southeast corner of the\r\nbuilding.[C6-34] He said that there was not any particular pattern that\r\nthe men used in putting them there. “They were just piled up there more\r\nor less at that time.”[C6-35] According to Truly, “several cartons”\r\nwhich had been in the extreme southeast corner had been placed on\r\ntop of the ones that had been piled in front of the southeast corner\r\nwindow.[C6-36]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the three boxes in the window and the one on which\r\nthe assassin may have sat has been described previously.[C6-37] Two\r\nof these four boxes, weighing approximately 55 pounds each, had been\r\nmoved by the floor-laying crew from the west side of the floor to the\r\narea near the southwest corner.[C6-38] The carton on which the assassin\r\nmay have sat might not even have been moved by the assassin at all.\r\nA photograph of the scene depicts this carton on the floor alongside\r\nother similar cartons. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1301, p. 138.)\r\nOswald’s right palmprint on this carton may have been placed there as\r\nhe was sitting on the carton rather than while carrying it. In any\r\nevent both of these 55-pound cartons could have been carried by one\r\nman. The remaining two cartons contained light block-like reading aids\r\ncalled “Rolling Readers” weighing only about 8 pounds each.[C6-39]\r\nAlthough they had been moved approximately 40 feet[C6-40] from their\r\nnormal locations at the southeast corner window, it would appear that\r\none man could have done this in a matter of seconds.\r\n\r\nIn considering the possibility of accomplices at the window, the\r\nCommission evaluated the significance of the presence of fingerprints\r\nother than Oswald’s on the four cartons found in and near the window.\r\nThree of Oswald’s prints were developed on two of the cartons.[C6-41]\r\nIn addition a total of 25 identifiable prints were found on the 4\r\ncartons.[C6-42] Moreover, prints were developed which were considered\r\nas not identifiable, i.e., the quality of the print was too fragmentary\r\nto be of value for identification purposes.[C6-43]\r\n\r\nAs has been explained in chapter IV, the Commission determined that\r\nnone of the warehouse employees who might have customarily handled\r\nthese cartons left prints which could be identified.[C6-44] This was\r\nconsidered of some probative value in determining whether Oswald moved\r\nthe cartons to the window. All but 1 of the 25 definitely identifiable\r\nprints were the prints of 2 persons--an FBI employee and a member of\r\nthe Dallas Police Department who had handled the cartons during the\r\ncourse of the investigation.[C6-45] One identifiable palmprint was not\r\nidentified.[C6-46]\r\n\r\nThe presence on these cartons of unidentified prints, whether or\r\nnot identifiable, does not appear to be unusual since these cartons\r\ncontained commercial products which had been handled by many people\r\nthroughout the normal course of manufacturing, warehousing, and\r\nshipping. Unlike other items of evidence such as, for example, a\r\nransom note in a kidnaping, these cartons could contain the prints of\r\nmany people having nothing to do with the assassination. Moreover,\r\nthe FBI does not maintain a filing system for palmprints because,\r\naccording to the supervisor of the Bureau’s latent fingerprint section,\r\nSebastian F. Latona, the problems of classification make such a system\r\nimpracticable.[C6-47] Finally, in considering the significance of the\r\nunidentified prints, the Commission gave weight to the opinion of\r\nLatona to the effect that people could handle these cartons without\r\nleaving prints which were capable of being developed.[C6-48]\r\n\r\nThough the fingerprints other than Oswald’s on the boxes thus provide\r\nno indication of the presence of an accomplice at the window, two\r\nDepository employees are known to have been present briefly on the\r\nsixth floor during the period between 11:45 a.m., when the floor-laying\r\ncrew stopped for lunch, and the moment of the assassination. One of\r\nthese was Charles Givens, a member of the floor-laying crew, who went\r\ndown on the elevator with the others and then, returned to the sixth\r\nfloor to get his jacket and cigarettes.[C6-49] He saw Oswald walking\r\naway from the southeast corner, but saw no one else on the sixth floor\r\nat that time. He then took one of the elevators back to the first floor\r\nat approximately 11:55 a.m.[C6-50]\r\n\r\nBonnie Ray Williams, who was also working with the floor-laying crew,\r\nreturned to the sixth floor at about noon to eat his lunch and watch\r\nthe motorcade.[C6-51] He looked out on Elm Street from a position\r\nin the area of the third or fourth set of windows from the east\r\nwall.[C6-52] At this point he was approximately 20-30 feet away from\r\nthe southeast corner window. He remained for about “5, 10, maybe 12\r\nminutes” eating his lunch which consisted of chicken and a bottle of\r\nsoda pop.[C6-53] Williams saw no one on the sixth floor during this\r\nperiod, although the stacks of books prevented his seeing the east side\r\nof the building.[C6-54] After finishing his lunch Williams took the\r\nelevator down because no one had joined him on the sixth floor to watch\r\nthe motorcade.[C6-55] He stopped at the fifth floor where he joined\r\nHarold Norman and James Jarman, Jr., who watched the motorcade with\r\nhim from a position on the fifth floor directly below the point from\r\nwhich the shots were fired. Williams left the remains of his lunch,\r\nincluding chicken bones and a bottle of soda, near the window where he\r\nwas eating.[C6-56]\r\n\r\nSeveral witnesses outside the building claim to have seen a person in\r\nthe southeast corner window of the sixth floor. As has already been\r\nindicated, some were able to offer better descriptions than others and\r\none, Howard L. Brennan, made a positive identification of Oswald as\r\nbeing the person at the window.[C6-57] Although there are differences\r\namong these witnesses with regard to their ability to describe the\r\nperson they saw, none of these witnesses testified to seeing more than\r\none person in the window.[C6-58]\r\n\r\nOne witness, however, offered testimony which, if accurate, would\r\ncreate the possibility of an accomplice at the window at the time of\r\nthe assassination. The witness was 18-year-old Arnold Rowland, who\r\ntestified in great detail concerning his activities and observations\r\non November 22, 1963. He and his wife were awaiting the motorcade,\r\nstanding on the east side of Houston Street between Maine and\r\nElm,[C6-59] when he looked toward the Depository Building and noticed\r\na man holding a rifle standing back from the southwest corner window\r\non the sixth floor. The man was rather slender in proportion to his\r\nsize and of light complexion with dark hair.[C6-60] Rowland said that\r\nhis wife was looking elsewhere at the time and when they looked back\r\nto the window the man “was gone from our vision.”[C6-61] They thought\r\nthe man was most likely someone protecting the President. After the\r\nassassination Rowland signed an affidavit in which he told of seeing\r\nthis man, although Rowland was unable to identify him.[C6-62]\r\n\r\nWhen Rowland testified before the Commission on March 10, 1964, he\r\nclaimed for the first time to have seen another person on the sixth\r\nfloor. Rowland said that before he had noticed the man with the rifle\r\non the southwest corner of the sixth floor he had seen an elderly Negro\r\nman “hanging out that window” on the southeast corner of the sixth\r\nfloor.[C6-63] Rowland described the Negro man as “very thin, an elderly\r\ngentleman, bald or practically bald, very thin hair if he wasn’t\r\nbald,” between 50 and 60 years of age, 5 feet 8 inches to 5 feet 10\r\ninches tall, with fairly dark complexion.[C6-64] Rowland claimed that\r\nhe looked back two or three times and noticed that the man remained\r\nuntil 5 or 6 minutes prior to the time the motorcade came. Rowland did\r\nnot see him thereafter. He made no mention of the Negro man in his\r\naffidavit.[C6-65] And, while he said he told FBI agents about the man\r\nin the southeast corner window when interviewed on the Saturday and\r\nSunday following the assassination,[C6-66] no such statement appears in\r\nany FBI report.[C6-67]\r\n\r\nMrs. Rowland testified that her husband never told her about seeing\r\nany other man on the sixth floor except the man with the rifle in\r\nthe southwest corner that he first saw. She also was present during\r\nRowland’s interview with representatives of the FBI[C6-68] and said\r\nshe did not hear him make such a statement,[C6-69] although she also\r\nsaid that she did not hear everything that was discussed.[C6-70]\r\nMrs. Rowland testified that after her husband first talked about\r\nseeing a man with the rifle, she looked back more than once at the\r\nDepository Building and saw no person looking out of any window on\r\nthe sixth floor.[C6-71] She also said that “At times my husband is\r\nprone to exaggerate.”[C6-72] Because of inconsistencies in Rowland’s\r\ntestimony and the importance of his testimony to the question of a\r\npossible accomplice, the Commission requested the FBI to conduct an\r\ninquiry into the truth of a broad range of statements made by Rowland\r\nto the Commission. The investigation showed that numerous statements\r\nby Rowland concerning matters about which he would not normally be\r\nexpected to be mistaken--such as subjects he studied in school, grades\r\nhe received, whether or not he had graduated from high school, and\r\nwhether or not he had been admitted to college--were false.[C6-73]\r\n\r\nThe only possible corroboration for Rowland’s story is found in the\r\ntestimony of Roger D. Craig, a deputy sheriff of Dallas County, whose\r\ntestimony on other aspects of the case has been discussed in chapter\r\nIV. Craig claimed that about 10 minutes after the assassination he\r\ntalked to a young couple, Mr. and Mrs. Rowland,\r\n\r\n    * * * and the boy said he saw two men on the sixth floor of\r\n    the Book Depository Building over there; one of them had a\r\n    rifle with a telescopic sight on it--but he thought they were\r\n    Secret Service agents or guards and didn’t report it. This\r\n    was about--oh, he said, 15 minutes before the motorcade ever\r\n    arrived.[C6-74]\r\n\r\nAccording to Craig, Rowland said that he looked back a few minutes\r\nlater and “the other man was gone, and there was just one man--the man\r\nwith the rifle.”[C6-75] Craig further testified that Rowland told him\r\nthat when he first saw the two men, they were walking back and forth in\r\nfront of the window for several minutes. They were both white men and\r\none of them had a rifle with a scope on it.[C6-76] This report by Craig\r\nis contradicted by the testimony of both the Rowlands, and by every\r\nrecorded interview with them conducted by law enforcement agencies\r\nafter the assassination.\r\n\r\nAs part of its investigation of Rowland’s allegation and of the\r\ngeneral question of accomplices at the scene of the assassination,\r\nthe Commission undertook an investigation of every person employed\r\nin the Texas School Book Depository Building. Two employees might\r\npossibly fit the general description of an elderly Negro man, bald or\r\nbalding. These two men were on the first floor of the building during\r\nthe period before and during the assassination.[C6-77] Moreover, all\r\nof the employees were asked whether they saw any strangers in the\r\nbuilding on the morning of November 22.[C6-78] Only one employee saw\r\na stranger whom he described as a feeble individual who had to be\r\nhelped up the front steps of the building. He went to a public restroom\r\nand left the building 5 minutes later, about 40 minutes before the\r\nassassination.[C6-79]\r\n\r\nRowland’s failure to report his story despite several interviews\r\nuntil his appearance before the Commission, the lack of probative\r\ncorroboration, and the serious doubts about his credibility, have led\r\nthe Commission to reject the testimony that Rowland saw an elderly\r\nbalding Negro man in the southeast corner window of the sixth floor of\r\nthe Depository Building several minutes before the assassination.\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald’s Escape\r\n\r\nThe Commission has analyzed Oswald’s movements between the time of\r\nthe assassination and the shooting of Patrolman Tippit to determine\r\nwhether there is any evidence that Oswald had assistance in his flight\r\nfrom the building. Oswald’s activities during this period have been\r\ntraced through the testimony of seven witnesses and discussed in detail\r\nin chapter IV.[C6-80] (See Commission Exhibit No. 1119-A, p. 158\r\nand Commission Exhibit No. 1118, p. 150.) Patrolman M. L. Baker and\r\nDepository superintendent Roy Truly saw him within 2 minutes of the\r\nassassination on the second floor of the building. Mrs. R. A. Reid saw\r\nhim less than 1 minute later walking through the second-floor offices\r\ntoward the front of the building. A busdriver, Cecil J. McWatters,\r\nand Oswald’s former landlady, Mrs. Mary Bledsoe, saw him board a bus\r\nat approximately 12:40 p.m., and get off about 4 minutes later. A\r\ncabdriver, William W. Whaley, drove Oswald from a cabstand located a\r\nfew blocks from where Oswald left the bus to a point in Oak Cliff about\r\nfour blocks from his roominghouse; and Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper\r\nat Oswald’s roominghouse, saw him enter the roominghouse at about 1\r\np.m. and leave a few minutes later. When seen by these seven witnesses\r\nOswald was always alone.\r\n\r\nParticular attention has been directed to Oswald’s departure from\r\nthe Depository Building in order to determine whether he could have\r\nleft the building within approximately 3 minutes of the assassination\r\nwithout assistance. As discussed more fully in chapter IV, the building\r\nwas probably first sealed off no earlier than 12:37 by Inspector\r\nHerbert Sawyer.[C6-81] The shortest estimate of the time taken to seal\r\noff the building comes from Police Officer W. E. Barnett, one of the\r\nofficers assigned to the corner of Elm and Houston Streets for the\r\nPresidential motorcade, who estimated that approximately 3 minutes\r\nelapsed between the time he heard the last of the shots and the time he\r\nstarted guarding the front door.[C6-82] According to Barnett, “there\r\nwere people going in and out” during this period.[C6-83] The evidence\r\ndiscussed in chapter IV shows that 3 minutes would have been sufficient\r\ntime for Oswald to have descended from the sixth floor and left the\r\nbuilding without assistance.[C6-84]\r\n\r\nOne witness, James R. Worrell, Jr., claims to have seen a man running\r\nfrom the rear of the building shortly after the assassination, but in\r\ntestimony before the Commission he stated that he could not see his\r\nface.[C6-85] Two other witnesses who watched the rear of the building\r\nduring the first 5 minutes after the shooting saw no one leave.[C6-86]\r\nThe claim of Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig that he saw Oswald leave the\r\nDepository Building approximately 15 minutes after the assassination\r\nhas been discussed in chapter IV.[C6-87] Although Craig may have seen\r\nsomeone enter a station wagon 15 minutes after the assassination, the\r\nperson he saw was not Lee Harvey Oswald, who was far removed from the\r\nbuilding at that time.\r\n\r\nThe possibility that accomplices aided Oswald in connection with\r\nhis escape was suggested by the testimony of Earlene Roberts, the\r\nhousekeeper at the 1026 North Beckley roominghouse.[C6-88] She\r\ntestified that at about 1 p.m. on November 22, after Oswald had\r\nreturned to the roominghouse, a Dallas police car drove slowly by the\r\nfront of the 1026 North Beckley premises and stopped momentarily; she\r\nsaid she heard its horn several times.[C6-89] Mrs. Roberts stated that\r\nthe occupants of the car were not known to her even though she had\r\nworked for some policemen who would occasionally come by.[C6-90] She\r\nsaid the policeman she knew drove car No. 170 and that this was not the\r\nnumber on the police car that honked on November 22. She testified that\r\nshe first thought the car she saw was No. 106 and then said that it was\r\nNo. 107.[C6-91] In an FBI interview she had stated that she looked out\r\nthe front window and saw police car No. 207.[C6-92] Investigation has\r\nnot produced any evidence that there was a police vehicle in the area\r\nof 1026 North Beckley at about 1 p.m. on November 22.[C6-93] Squad car\r\n207 was at the Texas School Book Depository Building, as was car 106.\r\nSquad cars 170 and 107 were sold in April 1963 and their numbers were\r\nnot reassigned until February 1964.[C6-94]\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the accuracy of Mrs. Roberts’ recollection concerning\r\nthe police car, it is apparent from Mrs. Roberts’ further testimony\r\nthat she did not see Oswald enter a car when he hurriedly left the\r\nhouse. She has stated that when she last saw Oswald, shortly after\r\n1 p.m., he was standing at a bus stop in front of the house.[C6-95]\r\nOswald was next seen less than 1 mile away, at the point where he shot\r\nPatrolman Tippit. Oswald could have easily reached this point on foot\r\nby about 1:16 p.m., when Tippit was shot. Finally, investigation has\r\nproduced no evidence that Oswald had prearranged plans for a means to\r\nleave Dallas after the assassination or that any other person was to\r\nhave provided him assistance in hiding or in departing the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD\r\n\r\nFinding no evidence in the circumstances immediately surrounding\r\nthe assassination that any person other than Lee Harvey Oswald was\r\ninvolved in the killing of the President, the Commission directed an\r\nintensive investigation into his life for the purpose, among others,\r\nof detecting any possible traces that at some point he became involved\r\nin a conspiracy culminating in the deed of November 22, 1963. As a\r\nproduct of this investigation, the Commission has compiled a detailed\r\nchronological biography of Oswald which is set forth as appendix XIII.\r\nStudy of the period from Oswald’s birth in 1939 to his military service\r\nfrom 1956 to 1959 has revealed no evidence that he was associated with\r\nany type of sinister or subversive organization during that period.\r\nThough his personality and political views took shape during these\r\nearly years, the events of that period are significant primarily to an\r\nunderstanding of the personality of Lee Harvey Oswald and are discussed\r\nin that connection in chapter VII. Beginning with his preparation for\r\ndefection to the Soviet Union in 1959, however, Oswald engaged in\r\nseveral activities which required close scrutiny by the Commission.\r\nIn an appraisal of Oswald’s actions since 1959 for the purpose of\r\ndetermining whether he was part of a conspiracy, several aspects of\r\nhis background and character must be borne in mind. He was young,\r\ninexperienced, and had only a limited education. As will be more fully\r\ndiscussed in chapter VII, he was unable to establish relationships\r\nwith others and had a resentment for authority and any discipline\r\nflowing from it. While he demonstrated the ability to act secretively\r\nand alone, without regard to the consequences to himself, as in his\r\ndefection to the Soviet Union, he does not appear to have been the\r\nkind of person whom one would normally expect to be selected as a\r\nconspirator.\r\n\r\n\r\nResidence in the Soviet Union\r\n\r\nLee Harvey Oswald was openly committed to Marxist ideology, he defected\r\nto the Soviet Union in 1959, and resided there until June of 1962,\r\neventually returning to the United States with a Russian wife. In\r\norder to evaluate rumors and speculations[C6-96] that Oswald may have\r\nbeen an agent of the Soviet Union, the Commission investigated the\r\nfacts surrounding Oswald’s stay in Russia. The Commission was thus\r\nfulfilling its obligation to probe all facts of possible relevance to\r\nthe assassination, and does not suggest by this investigation that the\r\nrulers of the Soviet Union believed that their political interests\r\nwould be advanced by the assassination of President Kennedy. On this\r\nquestion, the Secretary of State testified before the Commission on\r\nJune 10, 1964 as follows:\r\n\r\n    I have seen no evidence that would indicate to me that the\r\n    Soviet Union considered that it had an interest in the removal\r\n    of President Kennedy or that it was in any way involved in the\r\n    removal of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I have not seen or heard of any scrap of evidence indicating\r\n    that the Soviet Union had any desire to eliminate President\r\n    Kennedy nor in any way participated in any such event.\r\n\r\n    Now, standing back and trying to look at that question\r\n    objectively despite the ideological differences between our two\r\n    great systems, I can’t see how it could be to the interest of\r\n    the Soviet Union to make any such effort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I do think that the Soviet Union, again objectively considered,\r\n    has an interest in the correctness of state relations. This\r\n    would be particularly true among the great powers, with which\r\n    the major interests of the Soviet Union are directly engaged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I think that although there are grave differences between\r\n    the Communist world and the free world, between the Soviet\r\n    Union and other major powers, that even from their point of\r\n    view there needs to be some shape and form to international\r\n    relations, that it is not in their interest to have this world\r\n    structure dissolve into complete anarchy, that great states\r\n    and particularly nuclear powers have to be in a position to\r\n    deal with each other, to transact business with each other, to\r\n    try to meet problems with each other, and that requires the\r\n    maintenance of correct relations and access to the leadership\r\n    on all sides.\r\n\r\n    I think also that although there had been grave differences\r\n    between Chairman Khrushchev and President Kennedy, I think\r\n    there were evidences of a certain mutual respect that had\r\n    developed over some of the experiences, both good and bad,\r\n    through which these two men had lived.\r\n\r\n    I think both of them were aware of the fact that any Chairman\r\n    of the Soviet Union, and any President of the United States,\r\n    necessarily bear somewhat special responsibility for the\r\n    general peace of the world. Indeed without exaggeration, one\r\n    could almost say the existence of the northern hemisphere in\r\n    this nuclear age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    So that it would be an act of rashness and madness for Soviet\r\n    leaders to undertake such an action as an active policy.\r\n    Because everything would have been put in jeopardy or at stake\r\n    in connection with such an act.\r\n\r\n    It has not been our impression that madness has characterized\r\n    the actions of the Soviet leadership in recent years.[C6-97]\r\n\r\nThe Commission accepts Secretary Rusk’s estimate as reasonable\r\nand objective, but recognizes that a precise assessment of Soviet\r\nintentions or interests is most difficult. The Commission has thus\r\nexamined all the known facts regarding Oswald’s defection, residence\r\nin the Soviet Union, and return to the United States. At each step the\r\nCommission sought to determine whether there was any evidence which\r\nsupported a conclusion that Soviet authorities may have directly or\r\nindirectly influenced Oswald’s actions in assassinating the President.\r\n\r\n_Oswald’s entry into the Soviet Union._--Although the evidence is\r\ninconclusive as to the factors which motivated Oswald to go to the\r\nSoviet Union, there is no indication that he was prompted to do so by\r\nagents of that country. He may have begun to study the Russian language\r\nwhen he was stationed in Japan, which was intermittently from August\r\n1957 to November 1958.[C6-98] After he arrived in Moscow in October\r\n1959 he told several persons that he had been planning his defection\r\nfor 2 years, which suggests that the decision was made while he was\r\nin the Far East.[C6-99] George De Mohrenschildt, who met Oswald after\r\nhis return from the Soviet Union, testified that Oswald once told him\r\nmuch the same thing: “I met some Communists in Japan and they got me\r\nexcited and interested, and that was one of my inducements in going\r\nto Soviet Russia, to see what goes on there.”[C6-100] This evidence,\r\nhowever, is somewhat at variance with Oswald’s statements made to two\r\nAmerican newspaper reporters in Moscow shortly after his defection\r\nin 1959,[C6-101] and to other people in the United States after his\r\nreturn in 1962.[C6-102] Though his remarks were not inconsistent as to\r\nthe time he decided to defect, to these people he insisted that before\r\ngoing to the Soviet Union he had “never met a Communist” and that the\r\nintent to defect derived entirely from his own reading and thinking.\r\nHe said much the same to his brother in a letter he wrote to him from\r\nRussia explaining why he had defected.[C6-103] Which of Oswald’s\r\nstatements was the more accurate remains unknown.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that Oswald received outside assistance in\r\nfinancing his trip to the Soviet Union. After he arrived in Moscow,\r\nOswald told a newspaper correspondent, Aline Mosby, that he had saved\r\n$1,500 out of his Marine Corps salary to finance his defection,[C6-104]\r\nalthough the news story based upon Oswald’s interview with Aline Mosby\r\nunaccountably listed the sum of $1,600 instead of $1,500.[C6-105]\r\nAfter this article had appeared, Marguerite Oswald also related the\r\n$1,600 figure to an FBI agent.[C6-106] Either amount could have been\r\naccumulated out of Oswald’s earnings in the Marine Corps; during\r\nhis 2 years and 10 months of service he received $3,452.20, after\r\nall taxes, allotments and other deductions.[C6-107] Moreover Oswald\r\ncould certainly have made the entire trip on less than $1,000. The\r\nticket on the ship he took from New Orleans to Le Havre, France, cost\r\n$220.75;[C6-108] it cost him about $20 to reach London from Le Havre;\r\nhis plane fare from London to Helsinki, where he received his visa,\r\ncost him $111.90; he probably purchased Russian “tourist vouchers”\r\nnormally good for room and board for 10 days for $300; his train fare\r\nfrom Helsinki to Moscow was about $44; in Moscow he paid only $1.50 to\r\n$3 a night for his room and very little for his meals after his tourist\r\nvouchers ran out;[C6-109] and apparently he did not pay his hotel bill\r\nat all after November 30, 1959.[C6-110] Oswald’s known living habits\r\nindicate that he could be extraordinarily frugal when he had reason to\r\nbe, and it seems clear that he did have a strong desire to go to the\r\nSoviet Union.\r\n\r\nWhile in Atsugi, Japan, Oswald studied the Russian language, perhaps\r\nwith some help from an officer in his unit who was interested in\r\nRussian and used to “talk about it” with Oswald occasionally.[C6-111]\r\nHe studied by himself a great deal in late 1958 and early 1959 after\r\nhe was transferred from Japan to California.[C6-112] He took an Army\r\naptitude test in Russian in February 1959 and rated “Poor.”[C6-113]\r\nWhen he reached the Soviet Union in October of the same year he could\r\nbarely speak the language.[C6-114] During the period in Moscow while\r\nhe was awaiting decision on his application for citizenship, his diary\r\nrecords that he practiced Russian 8 hours a day.[C6-115] After he was\r\nsent to Minsk in early January 1960 he took lessons from an interpreter\r\nassigned to him for that purpose by the Soviet Government.[C6-116]\r\nMarina Oswald said that by the time she met him in March 1961 he spoke\r\nthe language well enough so that at first she thought he was from one\r\nof the Baltic areas of her country, because of his accent. She stated\r\nthat his only defects were that his grammar was sometimes incorrect and\r\nthat his writing was never good.[C6-117]\r\n\r\nThus, the limited evidence provides no indication that Oswald was\r\nrecruited by Soviet agents in the Far East with a view toward defection\r\nand eventual return to the United States. Moreover, on its face such a\r\npossibility is most unlikely. If Soviet agents had communicated with\r\nOswald while he was in the Marine Corps, one of the least probable\r\ninstructions they would have given him would have been to defect. If\r\nOswald had remained a Marine radar specialist, he might at some point\r\nhave reached a position of value as a secret agent. However, his\r\ndefection and the disloyal statements he made publicly in connection\r\nwith it eliminated the possibility that he would ever gain access to\r\nconfidential information or programs of the United States. The very\r\nfact that he defected, therefore, is itself persuasive evidence that he\r\nwas not recruited as an agent prior to his defection.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has investigated the circumstances under which Oswald\r\nobtained a visa to enter the Soviet Union for possible evidence that\r\nhe received preferential treatment in being permitted to enter the\r\ncountry. Oswald left New Orleans, La., for Europe on September 20,\r\n1959,[C6-118] having been released from active duty in the Marine Corps\r\non September 11, 1959.[C6-119] He went directly to Helsinki, Finland,\r\nby way of Le Havre, France, and London, England, arriving at Helsinki\r\non Saturday, October 10, 1959.[C6-120] Oswald probably arrived in\r\nHelsinki too late in the evening to have applied for a visa at the\r\nSoviet Union consulate that night.[C6-121] In light of the rapidity\r\nwith which he made connections throughout his entire trip,[C6-122] he\r\nprobably applied for a visa early on Monday, October 12. On October 14,\r\nhe was issued Soviet Tourist Visa No. 403339, good for one 6-day visit\r\nin the U.S.S.R.[C6-123] He left Helsinki on a train destined for Moscow\r\non October 15.[C6-124]\r\n\r\nThe Department of State has advised the Commission that it has some\r\ninformation that in 1959 it usually took an American tourist in\r\nHelsinki 1 to 2 weeks to obtain a visa,[C6-125] and that it has other\r\ninformation that the normal waiting period during the past 5 years has\r\nbeen a week or less.[C6-126] According to the Department’s information,\r\nthe waiting period has always varied frequently and widely, with one\r\nconfirmed instance in 1963 of a visa routinely issued in less than\r\n24 hours.[C6-127] The Central Intelligence Agency has indicated that\r\nvisas during the 1964 tourist season were being granted in about 5 to 7\r\ndays.[C6-128]\r\n\r\nThis information from the Department of State and the Central\r\nIntelligence Agency thus suggests that Oswald’s wait for a visa may\r\nhave been shorter than usual but not beyond the range of possible\r\nvariation. The prompt issuance of Oswald’s visa may have been merely\r\nthe result of normal procedures, due in part to the fact that the\r\nsummer rush had ended. It might also mean that Oswald was unusually\r\nurgent in his demands that his visa be issued promptly. Oswald himself\r\ntold officials at the American Embassy in Moscow on October 31, when\r\nhe appeared to renounce his citizenship, that he had said nothing to\r\nthe Soviets about defecting until he arrived in Moscow.[C6-129] In\r\nany event, the Commission has found nothing in the circumstances of\r\nOswald’s entry into the Soviet Union which indicates that he was at the\r\ntime an agent of the U.S.S.R.\r\n\r\n_Defection and admission to residence._--Two months and 22 days elapsed\r\nfrom Oswald’s arrival in Moscow until he left that city to take up\r\nresidence in Minsk. The Commission has considered the possibility that\r\nOswald was accepted for residence in the Soviet Union and sent to Minsk\r\nunusually soon after he arrived, either because he had been expected\r\nor because during his first weeks in Moscow he developed an undercover\r\nrelationship with the Soviet Government. In doing so, the Commission\r\nhas attempted to reconstruct the events of those months, though it is,\r\nof course, impossible to account for Oswald’s activities on every day\r\nof that period.\r\n\r\nOswald’s “Historic Diary,”[C6-130] which commences on October 16,\r\n1959, the date Oswald arrived in Moscow, and other writings he later\r\nprepared,[C6-131] have provided the Commission with one source of\r\ninformation about Oswald’s activities throughout his stay in the\r\nSoviet Union. Even assuming the diary was intended to be a truthful\r\nrecord, it is not an accurate guide to the details of Oswald’s\r\nactivities. Oswald seems not to have been concerned about the accuracy\r\nof dates and names,[C6-132] and apparently made many of his entries\r\nsubsequent to the date the events occurred. Marina Oswald testified\r\nthat she believed that her husband did not begin to keep the diary\r\nuntil he reached Minsk, 3 months after his arrival in Russia,[C6-133]\r\nand scraps of paper found in Oswald’s possession, containing much the\r\nsame information as appears in his diary,[C6-134] suggest that he\r\ntranscribed the entries into the diary at a later time. The substance\r\nof Oswald’s writings has been carefully examined for consistency\r\nwith all other related information available to the Commission. In\r\naddition, the writings have been checked for handwriting,[C6-135] and\r\nfor consistency of style, grammar, and spelling with earlier and later\r\nwritings which are known to be his.[C6-136] No indication has been\r\nfound that entries were written or coached by other persons.[C6-137]\r\n\r\nHowever, the most reliable information concerning the period Oswald\r\nspent in Moscow in the latter part of 1962 comes from the records\r\nof the American Embassy in Moscow,[C6-138] the testimony of Embassy\r\nofficials,[C6-139] and the notes of two American newspaper reporters,\r\nAline Mosby [C6-140] and Priscilla Johnson,[C6-141] who interviewed\r\nOswald during this period. Oswald’s correspondence with his brother and\r\nmother has also been relied upon for some relatively minor information.\r\nThe findings upon which the Commission based its conclusion concerning\r\nSoviet involvements in the assassination were supported by evidence\r\nother than material provided by the Soviet Union[C6-142] or Oswald’s\r\nwritings. The Central Intelligence Agency has also contributed data\r\non the normal practices and procedures of the Soviet authorities in\r\nhandling American defectors.\r\n\r\nThe “Historic Diary” indicates that on October 16, 1959, the day Oswald\r\narrived in Moscow, he told his Intourist guide, Rima Shirokova, that\r\nhe wished to renounce his American citizenship and become a Soviet\r\ncitizen. The same day, the guide reportedly helped Oswald prepare a\r\nletter to the Soviet authorities requesting citizenship.[C6-143] The\r\ndiary indicates, however, that on October 21 he was informed that\r\nhis visa had expired and that he would be required to leave Moscow\r\nwithin 2 hours.[C6-144] During the preceding days, according to the\r\ndiary, he had been interviewed once and perhaps twice by Soviet\r\nofficials.[C6-145] During this period the KGB,[B] the agency with\r\nprimary responsibility for examining defectors arriving in Russia,\r\nundoubtedly investigated Oswald as fully as possible. In 1959,\r\nvirtually all Intourist guides were KGB informants, and there is no\r\nreason to believe that this was not true of Oswald’s guide.[C6-146]\r\n\r\n    [B] The Committee for State Security, best known by its\r\n        Russian initials, “KGB,” is a lineal descendant of the\r\n        revolutionary ChEKA and has passed through numerous\r\n        changes of name since 1917 with little change of function.\r\n        Presently the KGB handles all Soviet counterintelligence\r\n        operations and is the instrument for various types of\r\n        subversive activities. It is responsible for the internal\r\n        security of the Soviet state and the safety of its leaders.\r\n        In addition it shares responsibility for foreign espionage\r\n        activities with the intelligence component of the Ministry\r\n        of Defense, the “GRU.” The KGB would have the primary\r\n        responsibility for keeping track of a defector such as\r\n        Oswald.\r\n\r\n        The Ministry of Internal Affairs or “MVD” was for many years\r\n        the designation of the organization responsible for civil\r\n        law enforcement and administration of prisons and forced\r\n        labor camps in the Soviet Union. During a part of its\r\n        history it also directed vast economic combines. In January\r\n        1960, the central or all-union MVD was abolished and its\r\n        powers transferred to the MVD’s of the several Soviet\r\n        republics. A further change took place in the summer of\r\n        1962, when the republic MVD’s were renamed Ministries for\r\n        the Preservation of Public Order and Safety. In the past\r\n        few years the republic MVD’s have been gradually divesting\r\n        themselves of their economic functions. When Lee Harvey\r\n        Oswald was in the Soviet Union though, the MVD still\r\n        carried on substantial economic activities. For example,\r\n        inmates of the MVD-administered “corrective labor colonies”\r\n        engaged in brickmaking, heavy construction work, and\r\n        lumbering.\r\n\r\n        In the Commission’s report, the term KGB will be used, as\r\n        above, to describe the principal Soviet counterintelligence\r\n        and espionage service. Oswald often inaccurately referred\r\n        to the “secret police” as the MVD; and in any quotations\r\n        from him, the Commission will reproduce his actual words.\r\n        Whenever the Commission refers to the MVD, it will be\r\n        referring to it as defined in this footnote.\r\n\r\nAccording to Oswald’s diary he attempted suicide when he learned\r\nhis application for citizenship had been denied.[C6-147] If true,\r\nthis would seem to provide strong evidence that, at least prior to\r\nOctober 21, there was no undercover relationship between Oswald and\r\nthe Soviet Government. Though not necessarily conclusive, there is\r\nconsiderable direct evidence which indicates that Oswald did slash his\r\nwrist. Oswald’s autopsy showed that he had a scar on his left wrist\r\nand that it was of the kind which could have been caused by a suicide\r\nattempt.[C6-148] The medical records from the Botkinskaya Hospital in\r\nMoscow, furnished by the Soviet Government, reveal that from October\r\n21 to October 28 he was treated there for a self-inflicted wound on\r\nthe left wrist.[C6-149] The information contained in these records is\r\nconsistent with the facts disclosed by the autopsy examination relating\r\nto Oswald’s wrist and to other facts known about Oswald. Although no\r\nwitness recalled Oswald mentioning a suicide attempt,[C6-150] Marina\r\nOswald testified that when she questioned her husband about the\r\nscar on his wrist, he became “very angry,” and avoided giving her a\r\nreply.[C6-151] Oswald’s character, discussed in the following chapter,\r\ndoes not seem inconsistent with a suicide or feigned suicide attempt,\r\nnor with his having failed to disclose the suicide attempt. Many\r\nwitnesses who testified before the Commission observed that he was not\r\nan “open” or trusting person, had a tendency toward arrogance, and was\r\nnot the kind of man who would readily admit weaknesses.[C6-152]\r\n\r\nOswald appeared at the American Embassy in Moscow on October 31,\r\n1959, 3 days after his release from the Botkinskaya Hospital.[C6-153]\r\nHe did not give the officials at the Embassy any indication that he\r\nhad recently received medical treatment.[C6-154] Oswald’s appearance\r\nwas the first notification to the American Government that he was\r\nin Russia, since he had failed to inform the Embassy upon his\r\narrival,[C6-155] as most American tourists did at the time.[C6-156]\r\nIn appendix XV, Oswald’s dealings with the Embassy in 1959 until his\r\nreturn to the United States in 1962 are described in full, and all\r\naction taken by the American officials on his case is evaluated. His\r\nconduct at the Embassy has also been considered by the Commission for\r\nany indication it may provide as to whether or not Oswald was then\r\nacting under directions of the Soviet Government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 913\r\n\r\nNOTE HANDED BY OSWALD TO THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN MOSCOW ON OCT. 31,\r\n1959]\r\n\r\nAt the Embassy, Oswald declared that he wished to renounce his U.S.\r\ncitizenship,[C6-157] but the consul to whom he spoke, Richard E.\r\nSnyder, refused to accept his renunciation at that time, telling him\r\nthat he would have to return to complete the necessary papers.[C6-158]\r\nHowever, Oswald did give the consul his passport[C6-159] and a\r\nhandwritten statement requesting that his American citizenship be\r\n“revoked” and “affirm[ing] [his] * * * allegiance” to the Soviet\r\nUnion.[C6-160] (See Commission Exhibit No. 913, p. 261.) The FBI has\r\nconfirmed that this statement is in Oswald’s handwriting,[C6-161]\r\nand Snyder has testified that the letter’s phrases are consistent\r\nwith the way Oswald talked and conducted himself.[C6-162] During the\r\napproximately 40-minute interview, Oswald also informed Snyder that he\r\nhad been a radar operator in the Marine Corps, intimating that he might\r\nknow something of special interest, and that he had informed a Soviet\r\nofficial that he would give the Soviets any information concerning\r\nthe Marine Corps and radar operation which he possessed.[C6-163]\r\nAlthough Oswald never filed a formal renunciation, in a letter to the\r\nEmbassy dated November 3, 1959, he again requested that his American\r\ncitizenship be revoked and protested the refusal to accept his\r\nrenunciation on October 31.[C6-164] (See Commission Exhibit No. 912, p.\r\n263.)\r\n\r\nWhile at the Embassy,[C6-165] and in a subsequent interview with\r\nan American journalist,[C6-166] Oswald displayed familiarity with\r\nCommunist ideological arguments, which led those with whom he spoke\r\nto speculate that he may have received some instruction from Soviet\r\nauthorities. Oswald’s familiarity with the law regarding renunciation\r\nof citizenship, observed by both Embassy officials,[C6-167] could also\r\nbe construed as a sign of coaching by Soviet authorities. However,\r\nOswald is known to have been an avid reader[C6-168] and there is\r\nevidence that he had read Communist literature without guidance while\r\nin the Marine Corps and before that time.[C6-169] After his arrival in\r\nMoscow, Oswald most probably had discussions with his Intourist guide\r\nand others,[C6-170] but none of the Americans with whom he talked in\r\nMoscow felt that his conversations necessarily revealed any type of\r\nformal training.[C6-171] The “Historic Diary” indicates that Oswald did\r\nnot tell his guide that he intended to visit the Embassy because he\r\nfeared she would disapprove.[C6-172] (See Commission Exhibit No. 24,\r\np. 264.) Though Oswald gave Snyder the impression “of an intelligent\r\nperson who spoke in a manner and on a level, which seemed to befit\r\nhis apparent level of intelligence,”[C6-173] correspondent Priscilla\r\nJohnson, who spent about 5 hours talking with him,[C6-174] received a\r\nmuch less favorable impression:\r\n\r\n    He liked to create the pretense, the impression that he was\r\n    attracted to abstract discussion and was capable of engaging in\r\n    it, and was drawn to it. But it was like pricking a balloon.\r\n    I had the feeling that if you really did engage him on this\r\n    ground, you very quickly would discover that he didn’t have\r\n    the capacity for a logical sustained argument about an abstract\r\n    point on economics or on noneconomic, political matters or any\r\n    matter, philosophical.[C6-175]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 912\r\n\r\nLETTER MAILED BY OSWALD TO THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN MOSCOW.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 24\r\n\r\nOSWALD’S OWN ACCOUNT OF HIS MEETING AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN MOSCOW\r\nOCT. 31, 1959\r\n\r\nExcerpts from his “Historic Diary”]\r\n\r\nA comparison of the formal note Oswald handed Snyder[C6-176] and his\r\nletter of November 3[C6-177] with the provisions of section 349(a)\r\nof the Immigration and Nationality Act[C6-178] suggests that Oswald\r\nhad read the statute but understood it imperfectly; he apparently was\r\ntrying to use three out of the four ways set out in the statute to\r\nsurrender his citizenship, but he succeeded in none.\r\n\r\nMoreover, persuasive evidence that Oswald’s conduct was not carefully\r\ncoached by Soviet agents is provided by some of his actions at the\r\nEmbassy. The single statement which probably caused Oswald the most\r\nfuture trouble was his declaration that he had already volunteered to a\r\nSoviet official that he would, if asked, tell the Soviet Government all\r\nthat he knew about his job in radar as a Marine. Certainly a statement\r\nof this type would prejudice any possibility of his being an effective\r\npro-Communist agent.\r\n\r\nFurther, though unquestionably evidencing anti-American sentiments,\r\nOswald’s behavior at the Embassy, which brought him exceedingly close\r\nto expatriation, was unlikely to have increased his value in any\r\ncapacity to the Soviet Union. Richard E. Snyder, the official who\r\ninterviewed Oswald on October 31, testified that he “had every reason\r\nto believe” that Oswald would have carried through a formal--and\r\ntherefore effective--renunciation of his American citizenship\r\nimmediately if he had let him.[C6-179] However, as a defector, Oswald\r\ncould have had considerable propaganda value without expatriating\r\nhimself; and if he had expatriated himself his eventual return to\r\nthe United States would have been much more difficult and perhaps\r\nimpossible. If Snyder’s assessment of Oswald’s intentions is accurate,\r\nit thus tends to refute the suggestion that Oswald was being coached\r\nby the Soviets. In addition, reporters noticed Oswald’s apparent\r\nambivalence in regard to renouncing his citizenship--stormily demanding\r\nthat he be permitted to renounce while failing to follow through by\r\ncompleting the necessary papers[C6-180]--behavior which might have\r\ndetracted from his propaganda value.\r\n\r\nAccording to Oswald’s “Historic Diary”[C6-181] and the documents\r\nfurnished to the Commission by the Soviet Government,[C6-182] Oswald\r\nwas not told that he had been accepted as a resident of the Soviet\r\nUnion until about January 4, 1960. Although on November 13 and 16\r\nOswald informed Aline Mosby[C6-183] and Priscilla Johnson[C6-184] that\r\nhe had been granted permission to remain in the country indefinitely,\r\nthe diary indicates that at that time he had been told only that\r\nhe could remain “until some solution is found with what to do with\r\nme.”[C6-185] The diary is more consistent with the letter Oswald\r\nwrote to his brother Robert on December 17, saying that he was then,\r\nmore than a month after he saw Johnson and Mosby, about to leave his\r\nhotel,[C6-186] and with some later correspondence with his mother.\r\nOswald mailed a short note to his mother which she received in Texas on\r\nJanuary 5; that same day she mailed a money order to him in Moscow,\r\nbut it apparently got there too late, because she received it back,\r\nunopened, on February 25.[C6-187] Oswald’s conflicting statement to the\r\ncorrespondents also seems reconcilable with his very apparent desire to\r\nappear important to others. Moreover, so long as Oswald continued to\r\nstay in a hotel in Moscow, the inference is that the Soviet authorities\r\nhad not yet decided to accept him.[C6-188] This inference is supported\r\nby information supplied by the CIA on the handling of other defectors\r\nin the Soviet Union.[C6-189]\r\n\r\nThus, the evidence is strong that Oswald waited at least until November\r\n16, when he saw Miss Johnson, and it is probable that he was required\r\nto wait until January 4, a little over 2½ months from October 16,\r\nbefore his application to remain in Russia was granted. In mid-November\r\nMiss Johnson asked Oswald whether the Russians were encouraging his\r\ndefection, to which Oswald responded: “The Russians are treating\r\nit like a legal formality. They don’t encourage you and they don’t\r\ndiscourage you.”[C6-190] And, when the Soviet Government finally acted,\r\nOswald did not receive Soviet citizenship, as he had requested, but\r\nmerely permission to reside in Russia on a year-to-year basis.[C6-191]\r\n\r\nAsked to comment upon the length of time, 2 months and 22 days, that\r\nprobably passed before Oswald was granted the right to remain in the\r\nSoviet Union, the CIA has advised that “when compared to five other\r\ndefector cases, this procedure seems unexceptional.”[C6-192] Similarly,\r\nthe Department of State reports that its information “indicated that a\r\n2-month waiting period is not unusual.”[C6-193] The full response of\r\nthe CIA is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Oswald said that he asked for Soviet citizenship on 16 October\r\n    1959. According to his diary, he received word a month later\r\n    that he could stay in the USSR pending disposition of his\r\n    request, but it was another month and a half before he was\r\n    given his stateless passport.\r\n\r\n    When compared to five other defector cases, this procedure\r\n    seems unexceptional. Two defectors from US Army intelligence\r\n    units in West Germany appear to have been given citizenship\r\n    immediately, but both had prior KGB connections and fled as\r\n    a result of Army security checks. Of the other three cases,\r\n    one was accepted after not more than five weeks and given a\r\n    stateless passport apparently at about the same time. The\r\n    second was immediately given permission to stay for a while,\r\n    and his subsequent request for citizenship was granted three\r\n    months later. The third was allowed to stay after he made his\r\n    citizenship request, but almost two months passed before he was\r\n    told that he had been accepted. Although the Soviet Ministry of\r\n    Foreign Affairs soon after told the US Embassy that he was a\r\n    Soviet citizen, he did not receive his document until five or\r\n    six months after initial application. We know of only one case\r\n    in which an American asked for Soviet citizenship but did not\r\n    take up residence in the USSR. In that instance, the American\r\n    changed his mind and voluntarily returned to the United\r\n    States less than three weeks after he had requested Soviet\r\n    citizenship.[C6-194]\r\n\r\nThe Department of State has commented as follows:\r\n\r\n    The files of the Department of State reflect the fact that\r\n    Oswald first applied for permission to remain in Russia\r\n    permanently, or at least for a long period, when he arrived in\r\n    Moscow, and that he obtained permission to remain within one or\r\n    two months.\r\n\r\n    A. Is the fact that he obtained permission to stay within this\r\n    period of time usual?\r\n\r\n    _Answer_--Our information indicates that a two months waiting\r\n    period is not unusual. In the case of [name withheld] the\r\n    Supreme Soviet decided within two months to give Soviet\r\n    citizenship and he was thereafter, of course, permitted to stay.\r\n\r\n    B. Can you tell us what the normal procedures are under similar\r\n    circumstances?\r\n\r\n    _Answer_--It is impossible for us to state any “normal”\r\n    procedures. The Soviet Government never publicizes the\r\n    proceedings in these cases or the reasons for its action.\r\n    Furthermore, it is, of course, extremely unusual for an\r\n    American citizen to defect.[C6-195]\r\n\r\nThe information relating to Oswald’s suicide attempt indicates that\r\nhis application to remain in the Soviet Union was probably rejected\r\nabout 6 days after his arrival in Moscow. Since the KGB is the Soviet\r\nagency responsible for the initial handling of all defectors,[C6-196]\r\nit seems likely that the original decision not to accept Oswald was\r\nmade by the KGB. That Oswald was permitted to remain in Moscow after\r\nhis release from the hospital suggests that another ministry of the\r\nSoviet Government may have intervened on his behalf. This hypothesis\r\nis consistent with entries in the “Historic Diary” commenting that the\r\nofficials Oswald met after his hospital treatment were different from\r\nthose with whom he had dealt before.[C6-197] The most plausible reason\r\nfor any such intervention may well have been apprehension over the\r\npublicity that would follow the rejection of a devout convert to the\r\nCommunist cause.\r\n\r\n_Oswald’s Life in Minsk._--According to the “Historic Diary”[C6-198]\r\nand documents received from the Soviet Government,[C6-199] Oswald\r\nresided in the city of Minsk from January 1960 until June 1962.\r\nOswald’s life in Minsk is the portion of his life concerning which the\r\nleast is known. The primary sources of information are Oswald’s own\r\nwritings and the testimony of Marina Oswald. Other evidence, however,\r\nestablishes beyond doubt that Oswald was in fact located in Minsk on\r\nat least two occasions. The Commission has obtained two photographs\r\nwhich were taken by American tourists in Minsk in August 1961 in which\r\nOswald appears.[C6-200] The tourists did not know Oswald, nor did\r\nthey speak with him; they remembered only that several men gathered\r\nnear their car.[C6-201] (See Kramer Exhibit 1, p. 268.) In addition,\r\nOswald was noticed in Minsk by a student who was traveling with the\r\nUniversity of Michigan band on a tour of Russia in the spring of\r\n1961.[C6-202] Oswald corresponded with the American Embassy in Moscow\r\nfrom Minsk,[C6-203] and wrote letters from Minsk to his family in\r\nthe United States.[C6-204] Oswald and his wife have many photographs\r\ntaken of themselves which show Minsk backgrounds and persons who are\r\nidentifiable as residents of Minsk.[C6-205] After he returned to the\r\nUnited States, Oswald conversed about the city with Russian-born\r\nAmerican citizens who were familiar with it.[C6-206] Marina Oswald\r\nis also familiar with the city.[C6-207] The Commission has also\r\nbeen able independently to verify the existence in Minsk of many of\r\nthe acquaintances of Oswald and his wife whom they said they knew\r\nthere.[C6-208] (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 1392, 1395, 2606, 2609,\r\n2612 and 2623, pp. 270-271.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSWALD, MAN STANDING ON RIGHT IN FIGURED SHIRT.\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH TAKEN IN MINSK, U.S.S.R. BY AN AMERICAN TOURIST IN AUGUST,\r\n1961.\r\n\r\n(KRAMER DEPOSITION 1)]\r\n\r\nOnce he was accepted as a resident alien in the Soviet Union, Oswald\r\nwas given considerable benefits which ordinary Soviet citizens in his\r\nposition in society did not have. The “Historic Diary” recites that\r\nafter Oswald was informed that he could remain in the Soviet Union and\r\nwas being sent to Minsk he was given 5,000 rubles[C] ($500) by the “Red\r\nCross, * * * for expenses.” He used 2,200 rubles to pay his hotel bill,\r\nand another 150 rubles to purchase a train ticket. With the balance\r\nof slightly over 2,500 rubles, Oswald felt, according to the diary,\r\nlike a rich man.[C6-209] Oswald did not receive free living quarters,\r\nas the diary indicates the “Mayor” of Minsk promised him,[C6-210] but\r\nabout 6 weeks after his arrival he did receive an apartment, very\r\npleasant by Soviet standards, for which he was required to pay only 60\r\nrubles ($6.00) a month. Oswald considered the apartment “almost rent\r\nfree.”[C6-211] Oswald was given a job in the “Byelorussian Radio and\r\nTelevision Factory,” where his pay on a per piece basis ranged from\r\n700 to 900 rubles ($70-$90) a month.[C6-212] According to his wife,\r\nthis rate of pay was average for people in his occupation but good\r\nby Soviet standards generally.[C6-213] She explained that piecework\r\nrates throughout the Soviet Union have generally grown out of line\r\nwith compensation for other jobs.[C6-214] The CIA has confirmed that\r\nthis condition exists in many areas and occupations in the Soviet\r\nUnion.[C6-215] In addition to his salary, Oswald regularly received\r\n700 rubles ($70) per month from the Soviet “Red Cross.”[C6-216] The\r\nwell-paying job, the monthly subsidy, and the “almost rent-free”\r\napartment combined to give Oswald more money than he needed. The only\r\ncomplaint recorded in the “Historic Diary” is that there was “no place\r\nto spend the money.”[C6-217]\r\n\r\n    [C] About a year after Oswald received this money, the ruble\r\n        was revalued to about 10 times its earlier value.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has found no basis for associating Oswald’s preferred\r\nincome with Soviet undercover activity. Marina Oswald testified that\r\nforeign nationals are commonly given special treatment in the Soviet\r\nUnion,[C6-218] and the Central Intelligence Agency has confirmed that\r\nit is standard practice in the Soviet Union for Americans and other\r\nforeign defectors from countries with high standards of living to be\r\n“subsidized.”[C6-219] Apparently it is Soviet practice to attempt\r\nto make life sufficiently pleasant for a foreign defector so that\r\nhe will not become disillusioned and return to his native country.\r\nThe Commission has also assumed that it is customary for Soviet\r\nintelligence agencies to keep defectors under surveillance during their\r\nresidence in the Soviet Union, through periodic interviews of neighbors\r\nand associates of the defector.[C6-220] Oswald once mentioned that the\r\nSoviet police questioned his neighbors occasionally.[C6-221]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE OSWALDS IN MINSK, U.S.S.R.\r\n\r\n(COMMISSION EXHIBIT 1392)\r\n\r\nOSWALD AND MARINA ON A BRIDGE IN MINSK\r\n\r\n(COMMISSION EXHIBIT 2623)\r\n\r\nUNCLE VASILY AKSIONOV AND AUNT LUBOVA AKSIONOVA, WITH THE OSWALDS\r\n\r\n(COMMISSION EXHIBIT 1395)\r\n\r\nMARINA WAITING FOR BUS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPHS OF OSWALDS IN U. S. S. R.\r\n\r\n(COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2609)\r\n\r\nROSA KUZNETSOVA, ELLA GERMAN, LEE HARVEY OSWALD, AND PAVEL GOLOVACHEV\r\n\r\n(COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2612)\r\n\r\nOSWALD AND ALFRED (LAST NAME UNKNOWN), A HUNGARIAN FRIEND OF ANITA ZIGER\r\n\r\n(COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2606)\r\n\r\nVIEW OVERLOOKING THE SYISLOCH RIVER FROM THE BALCONY OF THE OSWALDS’\r\nAPARTMENT IN MINSK]\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is from Oswald’s personal writings alone that the\r\nCommission has learned that he received supplementary funds from the\r\nSoviet “Red Cross.” In the notes he made during the return trip to\r\nthe United States Oswald recognized that the “Red Cross” subsidy had\r\nnothing to do with the well-known International Red Cross. He frankly\r\nstated that the money was paid to him for having “denounced” the\r\nUnited States and that it had come from the “MVD.”[C6-222] Oswald’s\r\npapers reveal that the “Red Cross” subsidy was terminated as soon as\r\nhe wrote the American Embassy in Moscow in February 1961 asking that\r\nhe be permitted to return.[C6-223] (See Commission Exhibit No. 25, p.\r\n273.) Marina Oswald’s testimony confirmed this; she said that when she\r\nknew Oswald he no longer was receiving the monthly grant but still\r\nretained some of the savings accumulated in the months when he had been\r\nreceiving it.[C6-224] Since she met Oswald in March and married him in\r\nApril of 1961, her testimony was consistent with his records.\r\n\r\nThe nature of Oswald’s employment while in Minsk has been examined\r\nby the Commission. The factory in which he worked was a large plant\r\nmanufacturing electronic parts and radio and television sets. Marina\r\nOswald has testified that he was an “apprentice machinist” and “ground\r\nsmall metallic parts for radio receivers, on a lathe.”[C6-225] So far\r\nas can be determined, Oswald never straightforwardly described to\r\nanyone else in the United States exactly what his job was in the Soviet\r\nUnion.[C6-226] Some of his acquaintances in Dallas and Fort Worth had\r\nthe impression that he was disappointed in having been given a menial\r\njob and not assigned to an institution of higher learning in the Soviet\r\nUnion.[C6-227] Marina Oswald confirmed this and also testified that\r\nher husband was not interested in his work and not regarded at the\r\nfactory as a very good worker.[C6-228] The documents furnished to the\r\nCommission by the Soviet government were consistent with her testimony\r\non this point, since they included a report from Oswald’s superior at\r\nthe factory which is critical of his performance on the job.[C6-229]\r\nOswald’s employment and his job performance are thus consistent with\r\nhis known occupational habits in this country and otherwise afford no\r\nground for suspicion.\r\n\r\nOswald’s membership in a hunting club while he was in the Soviet Union\r\nhas been a matter of special interest to the Commission. One Russian\r\nemigre testified that this was a suspicious circumstance because no one\r\nin the Soviet Union is permitted to own a gun for pleasure.[C6-230] The\r\nCommission’s investigation, however, has established that this is not\r\nso. The Central Intelligence Agency has advised the Commission that\r\nhunting societies such as the one to which Oswald belonged are very\r\npopular in the Soviet Union.[C6-231] They are frequently sponsored\r\nby factories for their employees, as was Oswald’s.[C6-232] Moreover,\r\nSoviet citizens (or foreigners residing in the Soviet Union) are\r\npermitted to own shotguns, but not rifles, without joining a society;\r\nall that is necessary is that the gun be registered at the local\r\nmilitia office immediately after it has been purchased.[C6-233] Experts\r\nfrom the Central Intelligence Agency have examined Oswald’s club\r\nmembership certificate and gun permit and expressed the opinion that\r\nits terms and numbers are consistent with other information the CIA has\r\nabout the Soviet Union.[C6-234]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 25)\r\n\r\nEXCERPTS FROM A SPEECH OSWALD NEVER DELIVERED, WHICH HE PROBABLY WROTE\r\nABOARD THE SHIP WHILE RETURNING FROM THE U. S. S. R. WITH HIS FAMILY]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald testified that her husband went hunting only on one\r\noccasion during the time of their marriage.[C6-235] However, Oswald\r\napparently joined the Byelorussian Society of Hunters and Fishermen\r\nin the summer of 1960[C6-236] and did not marry until April 30,\r\n1961,[C6-237] so he could have been more active while he was still a\r\nbachelor. Oswald made no secret of his membership in the hunting club.\r\nHe mentioned it on occasion to friends after he returned to the United\r\nStates;[C6-238] discussed it at some length in a speech at a Jesuit\r\nSeminary in Mobile, Ala., in the summer of 1962;[C6-239] included it\r\nin his correspondence with his brother Robert;[C6-240] and kept his\r\nmembership certificate[C6-241] and gun permit[C6-242] until the day\r\nhe was killed. In view of these facts, it is unlikely that Oswald’s\r\nmembership in a hunting club was contrived to conceal some sort of\r\nsecret training. Moreover, the CIA has informed the Commission that it\r\nis in possession of considerable information on the location of secret\r\nSoviet training institutions and that it knows of no such institution\r\nin or near Minsk during the time Oswald was there.[C6-243]\r\n\r\nOswald’s marriage to Marina Prusakova on April 30, 1961,[C6-244] is\r\nitself a fact meriting consideration. A foreigner living in Russia\r\ncannot marry without the permission of the Soviet Government.[C6-245]\r\nIt seems unlikely that the Soviet authorities would have permitted\r\nOswald to marry and to take his wife with him to the United States if\r\nthey were contemplating using him alone as an agent. The fact that\r\nhe had a Russian wife would be likely, in their view, to increase\r\nany surveillance under which he would be kept by American security\r\nagencies, would make him even more conspicuous to his neighbors as “an\r\nex-Russian,” and would decrease his mobility. A wife’s presence in the\r\nUnited States would also constitute a continuing risk of disclosure.\r\nOn the other hand, Marina Oswald’s lack of English training and her\r\ncomplete ignorance of the United States and its customs[C6-246] would\r\nscarcely recommend her to the Soviet authorities as one member of\r\nan “agent team” to be sent to the United States on a difficult and\r\ndangerous foreign enterprise.\r\n\r\n_Oswald’s departure from the Soviet Union._--On February 13, 1961, the\r\nAmerican Embassy in Moscow received a letter from Oswald postmarked\r\nMinsk, February 5, asking that he be readmitted to the United\r\nStates.[C6-247] This was the first time that the Embassy had heard\r\nfrom or about Oswald since November 16, 1959.[C6-248] The end of the\r\n15-month silence came only a few days after the Department of State in\r\nWashington had forwarded a request to the Moscow Embassy on February\r\n1, 1961, informing the Embassy that Oswald’s mother was worried about\r\nhim, and asking that he get in touch with her if possible.[C6-249]\r\nThe simultaneity of the two events was apparently coincidental. The\r\nrequest from Marguerite Oswald went from Washington to Moscow by\r\nsealed diplomatic pouch and there was no evidence that the seal had\r\nbeen tampered with.[C6-250] The officer of the Department of State\r\nwho carried the responsibility for such matters has testified that\r\nthe message was not forwarded to the Russians after it arrived in\r\nMoscow.[C6-251]\r\n\r\nOswald’s letter does not seem to have been designed to ingratiate him\r\nwith the Embassy officials. It starts by incorrectly implying that he\r\nhad written an earlier letter that was not answered, states that he\r\nwill return to the United States only if he can first “come to some\r\nagreement” on there being no legal charges brought against him, and\r\nends with a reminder to the officials at the Embassy that they have a\r\nresponsibility to do everything they can to help him, since he is an\r\nAmerican citizen.[C6-252]\r\n\r\nThe Embassy’s response to this letter was to invite Oswald to\r\ncome personally to Moscow to discuss the matter.[C6-253] Oswald\r\nat first protested because of the difficulty of obtaining Soviet\r\npermission.[C6-254] He wrote two more protesting letters during the\r\nfollowing 4 months,[C6-255] but received no indication that the Embassy\r\nwould allow him to handle the matter by mail.[C6-256] While the\r\nDepartment of State was clarifying its position on this matter,[C6-257]\r\nOswald unexpectedly appeared in Moscow on Saturday, July 8,\r\n1961.[C6-258] On Sunday, Marina Oswald flew to Moscow,[C6-259] and was\r\ninterviewed by officials in the American Embassy on Tuesday.[C6-260]\r\n\r\nThe Commission asked the Department of State and the Central\r\nIntelligence Agency to comment on whether the Oswalds’ travel to Moscow\r\nwithout permission signified special treatment by the Soviet Union.\r\nFrom their responses, it appears that since Marina Oswald possessed a\r\nSoviet citizen’s internal passport, she did not require prior approval\r\nto make the trip.[C6-261] Although Soviet law did require her husband,\r\nas the holder of a “stateless passport,” to obtain advance permission\r\nfor the trip, his failure to do so would not normally have been\r\nconsidered a serious violation. In this respect, the CIA has advised\r\nthe Commission as follows:\r\n\r\n    OSWALD’S travel from Minsk to Moscow and return in July 1961\r\n    would normally have required prior authorization. Bearers of a\r\n    Soviet “passport for foreigners” (_vid na zhitelstov v. SSSR\r\n    dlya innostrantsa_) are required to obtain travel authorization\r\n    from the Visa and Registration Department (OVIR) (or Passport\r\n    Registration Department (PRO) in smaller towns) if they desire\r\n    to leave the city (or oblast) where they are domiciled.\r\n    This same requirement is believed to apply to persons, such\r\n    as OSWALD, holding Soviet “stateless passports” (_vid na\r\n    zhitelstvo_ v. _SSSR dlya lits bez grazhdanstva_).\r\n\r\n    The practicality of even “unauthorized” travel was demonstrated\r\n    by events related by a United States citizen who defected\r\n    in 1960, and subsequently was sent to Kiev to study. After\r\n    repatriating this defector told U.S. authorities he had made\r\n    a total of seven unauthorized trips from Kiev during his stay\r\n    in the USSR. He was apprehended on two of his flights and was\r\n    returned to Kiev each time, the second time under escort. On\r\n    both occasions he was merely reprimanded by the deputy chief\r\n    of the institute at which he was studying. Since Marina had a\r\n    Soviet citizen’s internal passport there would have been no\r\n    restrictions against her making the trip to Moscow.[C6-262]\r\n\r\nThe answers of the Department of State, together with the Commission’s\r\nspecific questions, are as follows:\r\n\r\n    B. Could resident foreigners normally travel in this manner\r\n    without first obtaining such permission?\r\n\r\n    _Answer_--There are only a few U.S. nationals now living in the\r\n    Soviet Union. They include an American Roman Catholic priest,\r\n    an American Protestant minister, a number of correspondents,\r\n    some students and technical advisers to Soviet businesses. We\r\n    know that the priest, the minister, the correspondents and the\r\n    students must obtain permission from Soviet authorities before\r\n    taking any trips. The technical advisers notify officials of\r\n    their project before they travel and these officials personally\r\n    inform the militia.\r\n\r\n    C. If travel of this type was not freely permitted, do you\r\n    believe that Oswald normally would have been apprehended during\r\n    the attempt or punished after the fact for traveling without\r\n    permission?\r\n\r\n    _Answer_--Based on the information we have, we believe that\r\n    if Oswald went to Moscow without permission, and this was\r\n    known to the Soviet authorities, he would have been fined or\r\n    reprimanded. Oswald was not, of course, an average foreign\r\n    resident. He was a defector from a foreign country and the\r\n    bearer of a Soviet internal “stateless” passport * * * during\r\n    the time when he was contemplating the visit to Moscow to come\r\n    to the Embassy * * *\r\n\r\n    The Soviet authorities probably knew about Oswald’s trip\r\n    even if he did not obtain advance permission, since in most\r\n    instances the Soviet militia guards at the Embassy ask for the\r\n    documents of unidentified persons entering the Embassy grounds\r\n    * * *\r\n\r\n    An American citizen who, with her American citizen husband,\r\n    went to the Soviet Union to live permanently and is now trying\r\n    to obtain permission to leave, informed the Embassy that she\r\n    had been fined for not getting permission to go from Odessa to\r\n    Moscow on a recent trip to visit the Embassy.\r\n\r\n    D. Even if such travel did not have to be authorized, do you\r\n    have any information or observations regarding the practicality\r\n    of such travel by Soviet citizens or persons in Oswald’s status?\r\n\r\n    _Answer_--It is impossible to generalize in this area. We\r\n    understand from interrogations of former residents in the\r\n    Soviet Union who were considered “stateless” by Soviet\r\n    authorities that they were not permitted to leave the town\r\n    where they resided without permission of the police. In\r\n    requesting such permission they were required to fill out a\r\n    questionnaire giving the reason for travel, length of stay,\r\n    addresses of individuals to be visited, etc.\r\n\r\n    Notwithstanding these requirements, we know that at least\r\n    one “stateless” person often traveled without permission of\r\n    the authorities and stated that police stationed at railroad\r\n    stations usually spotchecked the identification papers of\r\n    every tenth traveler, but that it was an easy matter to avoid\r\n    such checks. Finally, she stated that persons who were caught\r\n    evading the registration requirements were returned to their\r\n    home towns by the police and sentenced to short jail terms\r\n    and fined. These sentences were more severe for repeated\r\n    violations.[C6-263]\r\n\r\nWhen Oswald arrived at the Embassy in Moscow, he met Richard E. Snyder,\r\nthe same person with whom he had dealt in October of 1959.[C6-264]\r\nPrimarily on the basis of Oswald’s interview with Snyder on Monday,\r\nJuly 10, 1961, the American Embassy concluded that Oswald had not\r\nexpatriated himself.[C6-265] (See app. XV, pp. 752-760.) On the\r\nbasis of this tentative decision, Oswald was given back his American\r\npassport, which he had surrendered in 1959.[C6-266] The document was\r\ndue to expire in September 1961,[C6-267] however, and Oswald was\r\ninformed that its renewal would depend upon the ultimate decision by\r\nthe Department of State on his expatriation.[C6-268] On July 11, Marina\r\nOswald was interviewed at the Embassy and the steps necessary for her\r\nto obtain an American visa were begun.[C6-269] In May 1962, after 15\r\nmonths of dealings with the Embassy, Oswald’s passport was ultimately\r\nrenewed and permission for his wife to enter the United States was\r\ngranted.[C6-270]\r\n\r\nThe files on Oswald and his wife compiled by the Department of State\r\nand the Immigration and Naturalization Service contain no indication\r\nof any expert guidance by Soviet authorities in Oswald’s dealings with\r\nthe Department or the Service. For example, the letters from Minsk to\r\nthe Embassy in Moscow,[C6-271] which are in his handwriting,[C6-272]\r\ndisplay the arrogant attitude which was characteristic of him both\r\nbefore and after he lived in Russia, and, when compared with other\r\nletters that were without doubt composed and written by him,[C6-273]\r\nshow about the same low level of sophistication, fluency, and spelling.\r\nThe Department officer who most frequently dealt with Oswald when he\r\nbegan negotiations to return to the United States, Richard E. Snyder,\r\ntestified that he can recall nothing that indicated Oswald was being\r\nguided or assisted by a third party when he appeared at the Embassy\r\nin July 1961.[C6-274] On the contrary, the arrogant and presumptuous\r\nattitude which Oswald displayed in his correspondence with the Embassy\r\nfrom early 1961 until June 1962,[C6-275] when he finally departed from\r\nRussia, undoubtedly hindered his attempts to return to the United\r\nStates. Snyder has testified that although he made a sincere effort to\r\ntreat Oswald’s application objectively, Oswald’s attitude made this\r\nvery difficult.[C6-276]\r\n\r\nIn order to leave Russia, it was also necessary for the Oswalds\r\nto obtain permission from the Soviet Government. The timing and\r\ncircumstances under which the Oswalds obtained this permission have\r\nalso been considered by the Commission. Marina Oswald, although her\r\nmemory is not clear on the point, said that she and Oswald first\r\nmade their intentions to go to the United States known to Soviet\r\nofficials in Minsk in May, even before coming to Moscow in July for the\r\nconference at the American Embassy.[C6-277] The Oswalds’ correspondence\r\nwith the Embassy and the documents furnished the Commission by the\r\nSoviet Government show that the Oswalds made a series of formal\r\napplications to the Soviets from July 15 to August 21.[C6-278]\r\nPresumably the most difficult question for the Soviet authorities\r\nwas whether to allow Marina Oswald to accompany her husband. She was\r\ncalled to the local passport office in Minsk on December 25, 1961, and\r\ntold that authority had been received to issue exit visas to her and\r\nOswald.[C6-279] Obtaining the permission of the Soviet Government to\r\nleave may have been aided by a conference which Marina Oswald had, at\r\nher own request, with a local MVD official, Colonel Aksenov, sometime\r\nin late 1961. She testified that she applied for the conference at her\r\nhusband’s urging, after he had tried unsuccessfully to arrange such\r\na conference for himself.[C6-280] She believed that it may have been\r\ngranted her because her uncle with whom she had lived in Minsk before\r\nher marriage was also an MVD official.[C6-281]\r\n\r\nThe correspondence with the American Embassy at this time reflected\r\nthat the Oswalds did not pick up their exit visas immediately.[C6-282]\r\nOn January 11, 1962, Marina Oswald was issued her Soviet exit visa.\r\nIt was marked valid until December 1, 1962.[C6-283] The Oswalds did\r\nnot leave Russia until June 1962, but the additional delay was caused\r\nby problems with the U.S. Government and by the birth of a child in\r\nFebruary.[C6-284] Permission of the Soviet authorities to leave, once\r\ngiven, was never revoked. Oswald told the FBI in July 1962, shortly\r\nafter he returned to the United States, that he had been interviewed\r\nby the MVD twice, once when he first came to the Soviet Union and once\r\njust before he departed.[C6-285] His wife testified that the second\r\ninterview did not occur in Moscow but that she and her husband dealt\r\nwith the MVD visa officials frequently in Minsk.[C6-286]\r\n\r\nInvestigation of the circumstances, including the timing, under which\r\nthe Oswalds obtained permission from the Soviet Government to leave\r\nRussia for the United States show that they differed in no discernible\r\nmanner from the normal. The Central Intelligence Agency has informed\r\nthe Commission that normally a Soviet national would not be permitted\r\nto emigrate if he might endanger Soviet national security once he\r\nwent abroad.[C6-287] Those persons in possession of confidential\r\ninformation, for example, would constitute an important category of\r\nsuch “security risks.” Apparently Oswald’s predeparture interview by\r\nthe MVD was part of an attempt to ascertain whether he or his wife\r\nhad access to any confidential information. Marina Oswald’s reported\r\ninterview with the MVD in late 1961, which was arranged at her request,\r\nmay have served the same purpose. The Commission’s awareness of both\r\ninterviews derives entirely from Oswald’s and his wife’s statements and\r\nletters to the American Embassy, which afford additional evidence that\r\nthe conferences carried no subversive significance.\r\n\r\nIt took the Soviet authorities at least 5½ months, from about July 15,\r\n1961, until late December, to grant permission for the Oswalds to leave\r\nthe country. When asked to comment upon the alleged rapidity of the\r\nOswalds’ departure, the Department of State advised the Commission:\r\n\r\n    * * * In the immediate post-war period there were about fifteen\r\n    marriages in which the wife had been waiting for many years\r\n    for a Soviet exit permit. After the death of Stalin the Soviet\r\n    Government showed a disposition to settle these cases. In the\r\n    summer of 1953 permission was given for all of this group\r\n    of Soviet citizen wives to accompany their American citizen\r\n    husbands to the United States.\r\n\r\n    Since this group was given permission to leave the Soviet\r\n    Union, there have been from time to time marriages in the\r\n    Soviet Union of American citizens and Soviet citizens. With\r\n    one exception, it is our understanding that all of the Soviet\r\n    citizens involved have been given permission to emigrate to the\r\n    United States after waiting periods which were, in some cases\r\n    from three to six months and in others much longer.[C6-288]\r\n\r\nBoth the Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency\r\ncompiled data for the Commission on Soviet wives of American citizens\r\nwho received exit visas to leave the Soviet Union, where the relevant\r\ninformation was available. In both cases the data were consistent\r\nwith the above conclusion of the State Department. The Department of\r\nState had sufficient information to measure the timespan in 14 cases.\r\nThe Department points out that it has information on the dates of\r\napplication for and receipt of Soviet exit visas only on those cases\r\nthat have been brought to its attention. A common reason for bringing\r\na case to the attention of the Department is that the granting of the\r\nexit visa by the Soviet Union has been delayed, so that the American\r\nspouse seeks the assistance of his own government. It therefore\r\nappears that the sampling data carry a distinct bias toward lengthy\r\nwaiting periods. Of the 14 cases tested, 6 involve women who applied\r\nfor visas after 1953, when the liberalized post-Stalin policy was\r\nin effect. The approximate waiting periods for these wives were, in\r\ndecreasing order, 13 months, 6 months, 3 months, 1 month, and 10\r\ndays.[C6-289] Of the 11 cases examined by the Central Intelligence\r\nAgency in which the time period is known or can be inferred, the Soviet\r\nwives had to wait from 5 months to a year to obtain exit visas.[C6-290]\r\n\r\nIn his correspondence with the American Embassy and his brother\r\nwhile he was in Russia,[C6-291] in his diary,[C6-292] and in\r\nhis conversations with people in the United States after he\r\nreturned,[C6-293] Oswald claimed that his wife had been subjected\r\nto pressure by the Soviet Government in an effort to induce her not\r\nto emigrate to the United States. In the Embassy correspondence,\r\nOswald claimed that the pressure had been so intense that she had\r\nto be hospitalized for 5 days for “nervous exhaustion.”[C6-294]\r\nMarina Oswald testified that her husband exaggerated and that no such\r\nhospitalization or “nervous exhaustion” ever occurred.[C6-295] However,\r\nshe did testify that she was questioned on the matter occasionally\r\nand given the impression that her government was not pleased with her\r\ndecision.[C6-296] Her aunt and uncle in Minsk did not speak to her “for\r\na long time”; she also stated that she was dropped from membership in\r\nthe Communist Youth Organization (Komsomol) when the news of her visit\r\nto the American Embassy in Moscow reached that organization.[C6-297]\r\nA student who took Russian lessons from her in Texas testified that\r\nshe once referred to the days when the pressure was applied as “a\r\nvery horrible time.”[C6-298] Despite all this Marina Oswald testified\r\nthat she was surprised that their visas were granted as soon as they\r\nwere--and that hers was granted at all.[C6-299] This evidence thus\r\nindicates that the Soviet authorities, rather than facilitating the\r\ndeparture of the Oswalds, first tried to dissuade Marina Oswald from\r\ngoing to the United States and then, when she failed to respond to\r\nthe pressure, permitted her to leave without undue delay. There are\r\nindications that the Soviet treatment of another recent defector who\r\nleft the Soviet Union to return to the United States resembled that\r\naccorded to the Oswalds.[C6-300]\r\n\r\nOn the basis of all the foregoing evidence, the Commission concluded\r\nthat there was no reason to believe that the Oswalds received unusually\r\nfavorable treatment in being permitted to leave the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociations in the Dallas-Fort Worth Community\r\n\r\n_The Russian-speaking community._--Shortly after his return from Russia\r\nin June 1962, Oswald and his family settled in Fort Worth, Tex., where\r\nthey met a group of Russian-born or Russian-speaking persons in the\r\nDallas-Fort Worth area.[C6-301] The members of this community were\r\nattracted to each other by common background, language, and culture.\r\nMany of them were well-educated, accomplished, and industrious\r\npeople, several being connected with the oil exploration, production,\r\nand processing industry that flourishes in the Dallas-Fort Worth\r\narea.[C6-302] As described more fully in chapter VII and in appendix\r\nXIII, many of these persons assisted the Oswalds in various ways. Some\r\nprovided the Oswalds with gifts of such things as food, clothing, and\r\nbaby furniture.[C6-303] Some arranged appointments and transportation\r\nfor medical and dental treatment, and assumed the cost in some\r\ninstances.[C6-304] When Oswald undertook to look for employment in\r\nDallas in early October of 1962 and again when marital difficulties\r\narose between the Oswalds in November of the same year, Marina Oswald\r\nand their child were housed at times in the homes of various members\r\nof the group.[C6-305] The Commission has examined the background of\r\nmany of these individuals and has thoroughly investigated Oswald’s\r\nrelationship with them.\r\n\r\nThere is no basis to suppose that Oswald came to Fort Worth upon his\r\nreturn from Russia for the purpose of establishing contacts with the\r\nRussian-speaking community located in that area. Oswald had spent\r\nseveral of his grammar-school years in Fort Worth.[C6-306] In 1962, his\r\nbrother Robert lived in Fort Worth and his mother resided in nearby\r\nVernon, Tex. In January of that year, Oswald indicated to American\r\nofficials in Russia that he intended to stay with his mother upon his\r\nreturn to the United States; however, sometime after mid-February, he\r\nreceived an invitation to stay with Robert and his family until he\r\nbecame settled, and he did spend the first several weeks after his\r\nreturn at Robert’s home.[C6-307] In July, Oswald’s mother moved to Fort\r\nWorth and Oswald and his wife and child moved into an apartment with\r\nher.[C6-308] While in that apartment, Oswald located a job in Fort\r\nWorth and then rented and moved with his family into an apartment on\r\nMercedes Street.[C6-309]\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival in 1962, Oswald did not know any members of the\r\nrelatively small and loosely knit Russian-speaking community.[C6-310]\r\nShortly after his arrival Oswald obtained the name of two\r\nRussian-speaking persons in Fort Worth from the office of the Texas\r\nEmployment Commission in that city.[C6-311] Attempts to arrange a\r\nprompt visit with one of them failed.[C6-312] The second person,\r\nPeter Paul Gregory, was a consulting petroleum engineer and part-time\r\nRussian-language instructor at the Fort Worth Public Library. Oswald\r\ncontacted him in order to obtain a letter certifying to his proficiency\r\nin Russian and Marina Oswald later tutored his son in the Russian\r\nlanguage.[C6-313] Gregory introduced the Oswalds to George Bouhe and\r\nAnna Meller, both of whom lived in Dallas and became interested in\r\nthe welfare of Marina Oswald and her child.[C6-314] Through them,\r\nother members of the Russian community became acquainted with the\r\nOswalds.[C6-315]\r\n\r\nThe Oswalds met some 30 persons in the Russian-speaking community,\r\nof whom 25 testified before the Commission or its staff; others\r\nwere interviewed on behalf of the Commission.[C6-316] This range of\r\ntestimony has disclosed that the relationship between Lee Harvey Oswald\r\nand the Russian-speaking community was short lived and generally quite\r\nstrained.[C6-317] During October and November of 1962 Marina Oswald\r\nlived at the homes of some of the members of the Russian-speaking\r\ncommunity.[C6-318] She stayed first with Elena Hall while Oswald\r\nwas looking for work in Dallas.[C6-319] In early November, Marina\r\nOswald and the baby joined Oswald in Dallas, but soon thereafter, she\r\nspent approximately 2 weeks with different Russian-speaking friends\r\nduring another separation.[C6-320] Oswald openly resented the help\r\nMarina’s “Russian friends” gave to him and his wife and the efforts\r\nof some of them to induce Marina to leave him.[C6-321] George Bouhe\r\nattempted to dissuade Marina from returning to her husband in November\r\n1962, and when she rejoined him, Bouhe became displeased with her as\r\nwell.[C6-322] Relations between the Oswalds and the members of the\r\nRussian community had practically ceased by the end of 1962. Katherine\r\nFord, one of the members of the group, summed up the situation as it\r\nexisted at the end of January 1963: “So it was rather, sort of, Marina\r\nand her husband were dropped at that time, nobody actually wanted to\r\nhelp. * * *”[C6-323]\r\n\r\nIn April of 1963, Oswald left Fort Worth for New Orleans, where he\r\nwas later joined by his wife and daughter, and remained until his\r\ntrip to Mexico City in late September and his subsequent return to\r\nthe Dallas-Fort Worth area in early October of 1963.[C6-324] With\r\nonly minor exceptions,[C6-325] there is no evidence that any member\r\nof the Russian-speaking community had further contact with Oswald or\r\nhis family after April.[C6-326] In New Orleans, Oswald made no attempt\r\nto make new Russian-speaking acquaintances for his wife and there is\r\nno evidence that he developed any friendships in that city.[C6-327]\r\nSimilarly, after the return from New Orleans, there seems to have been\r\nno communication between the Oswalds and this group until the evening\r\nof November 22, 1963, when the Dallas Police enlisted Ilya Mamantov\r\nto serve as an interpreter for them in their questioning of Marina\r\nOswald.[C6-328]\r\n\r\nGeorge De Mohrenschildt and his wife, both of whom speak Russian\r\nas well as several other languages, however, did continue to see\r\nthe Oswalds on occasion up to about the time Oswald went to New\r\nOrleans on April 24, 1963. De Mohrenschildt was apparently the\r\nonly Russian-speaking person living in Dallas for whom Oswald had\r\nappreciable respect, and this seems to have been true even though De\r\nMohrenschildt helped Marina Oswald leave her husband for a period in\r\nNovember of 1962.[C6-329]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the relations between Oswald and De Mohrenschildt,\r\nthe Commission has considered testimony concerning an event which\r\noccurred shortly after Oswald shot at General Walker. The De\r\nMohrenschildts came to Oswald’s apartment on Neely Street for the\r\nfirst time on the evening of April 13, 1963, apparently to bring\r\nan Easter gift for the Oswald child.[C6-330] Mrs. De Mohrenschildt\r\ntestified that while Marina Oswald was showing her the apartment, she\r\nsaw a rifle with a scope in a closet. Mrs. De Mohrenschildt then told\r\nher husband, in the presence of the Oswalds, that there was a rifle\r\nin the closet.[C6-331] Mrs. De Mohrenschildt testified that “George,\r\nof course, with his sense of humor--Walker was shot at a few days\r\nago, within that time. He said, ‘Did you take a pot shot at Walker by\r\nany chance?’”[C6-332] At that point, Mr. De Mohrenschildt testified,\r\nOswald “sort of shriveled, you see, when I asked this question. *\r\n* * made a peculiar face * * * [and] changed the expression on his\r\nface” and remarked that he did targetshooting.[C6-333] Marina Oswald\r\ntestified that the De Mohrenschildts came to visit a few days after the\r\nWalker incident and that when De Mohrenschildt made his reference to\r\nOswald’s possibly shooting at Walker, Oswald’s “face changed, * * * he\r\nalmost became speechless.”[C6-334] According to the De Mohrenschildts,\r\nMr. De Mohrenschildt’s remark was intended as a joke, and he had no\r\nknowledge of Oswald’s involvement in the attack on Walker.[C6-335]\r\nNonetheless, the remark appears to have created an uncomfortable\r\nsilence, and the De Mohrenschildts left “very soon afterwards.” They\r\nnever saw either of the Oswalds again.[C6-336] They left in a few days\r\non a trip to New York City and did not return until after Oswald had\r\ngone to New Orleans.[C6-337] A postcard from Oswald to De Mohrenschildt\r\nwas apparently the only contact they had thereafter.[C6-338] The De\r\nMohrenschildts left in early June for Haiti on a business venture, and\r\nthey were still residing there at the time they testified on April 23,\r\n1964.[C6-339]\r\n\r\nExtensive investigation has been conducted into the background of\r\nboth De Mohrenschildts.[C6-340] The investigation has revealed that\r\nGeorge De Mohrenschildt is a highly individualistic person of varied\r\ninterests. He was born in the Russian Ukraine in 1911 and fled Russia\r\nwith his parents in 1921 during the civil disorder following the\r\nrevolution. He was in a Polish cavalry military academy for 1½ years.\r\nLater he studied in Antwerp and attended the University of Liege from\r\nwhich he received a doctor’s degree in international commerce in\r\n1928. Soon thereafter, he emigrated to the United States; he became\r\na U.S. citizen in 1949.[C6-341] De Mohrenschildt eventually became\r\ninterested in oil exploration and production; he entered the University\r\nof Texas in 1944 and received a master’s degree in petroleum geology\r\nand petroleum engineering in 1945.[C6-342] He has since become active\r\nas a petroleum engineer throughout the world.[C6-343] In 1960, after\r\nthe death of his son, he and his wife made an 8-month hike from the\r\nUnited States-Mexican border to Panama over primitive jungle trails.\r\nBy happenstance they were in Guatemala City at the time of the Bay of\r\nPigs invasion.[C6-344] A lengthy film and complete written log was\r\nprepared by De Mohrenschildt and a report of the trip was made to\r\nthe U.S. Government.[C6-345] Upon arriving in Panama they journeyed\r\nto Haiti where De Mohrenschildt eventually became involved in a\r\nGovernment-oriented business venture in which he has been engaged\r\ncontinuously since June 1963 until the time of this report.[C6-346]\r\n\r\nThe members of the Dallas-Fort Worth Russian community and others\r\nhave variously described De Mohrenschildt as eccentric, outspoken,\r\nand a strong believer in individual liberties and in the U.S. form\r\nof government, but also of the belief that some form of undemocratic\r\ngovernment might be best for other peoples.[C6-347] De Mohrenschildt\r\nfrankly admits his provocative personality.[C6-348]\r\n\r\nJeanne De Mohrenschildt was born in Harbin, China, of White Russian\r\nparents. She left during the war with Japan, coming to New York in 1938\r\nwhere she became a successful ladies dress and sportswear apparel\r\ndesigner. She married her present husband in 1959.[C6-349]\r\n\r\nThe Commission’s investigation has developed no signs of subversive\r\nor disloyal conduct on the part of either of the De Mohrenschildts.\r\nNeither the FBI, CIA, nor any witness contacted by the Commission has\r\nprovided any information linking the De Mohrenschildts to subversive\r\nor extremist organizations.[C6-350] Nor has there been any evidence\r\nlinking them in any way with the assassination of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has also considered closely the relations between the\r\nOswalds and Michael and Ruth Paine of Irving, Tex. The Paines were\r\nnot part of the Russian community which has been discussed above.\r\nRuth Paine speaks Russian, however, and for this reason was invited\r\nto a party in February of 1963 at which she became acquainted with\r\nthe Oswalds.[C6-351] The host had met the Oswalds through the De\r\nMohrenschildts.[C6-352] Marina Oswald and Ruth Paine subsequently\r\nbecame quite friendly, and Mrs. Paine provided considerable assistance\r\nto the Oswalds.[C6-353] Marina Oswald and her child resided with\r\nRuth Paine for a little over 2 weeks while Oswald sought a job in\r\nNew Orleans in late April and early May 1963.[C6-354] In May, she\r\ntransported Marina Oswald to New Orleans, paying all of the traveling\r\nand other expenses.[C6-355] While the Oswalds were in New Orleans,\r\nthe two women corresponded.[C6-356] Mrs. Paine came to New Orleans in\r\nlate September and took Marina Oswald and her child to her home in\r\nIrving.[C6-357]\r\n\r\nSince Oswald left for Mexico City promptly after Mrs. Paine and his\r\nfamily departed New Orleans,[C6-358] the Commission has considered\r\nwhether Ruth Paine’s trip to New Orleans was undertaken to assist\r\nOswald in this venture, but the evidence is clear that it was not. In\r\nher letters to Ruth Paine during the summer of 1963, Marina Oswald\r\nconfided that she was having continuing difficulties with her husband,\r\nand Mrs. Paine urged Marina Oswald to live with her in Irving; the\r\nletters of the two women prior to Mrs. Paine’s arrival in New Orleans\r\non September 20, 1963, however, contain no mention that Oswald was\r\nplanning a trip to Mexico City or elsewhere.[C6-359] In New Orleans,\r\nMrs. Paine was told by Oswald that he planned to seek employment in\r\nHouston, or perhaps Philadelphia. Though Marina Oswald knew this to\r\nbe false, she testified that she joined in this deception.[C6-360] At\r\nno time during the entire weekend was Mexico City mentioned.[C6-361]\r\nCorroboration for this testimony is found in a letter Mrs. Paine wrote\r\nher mother shortly after she and Marina Oswald had returned to Irving\r\non September 24, in which she stated that Marina Oswald was again\r\nliving with her temporarily and that Oswald was job-hunting.[C6-362]\r\nWhen Oswald arrived at the Paine home on October 4, he continued his\r\ndeception by telling Mrs. Paine, in his wife’s presence, that he had\r\nbeen unsuccessful in finding employment.[C6-363] At Oswald’s request,\r\nMarina Oswald remained silent.[C6-364]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald lived with Ruth Paine through the birth of her second\r\ndaughter on October 20, 1963, and until the assassination of President\r\nKennedy.[C6-365] During this period, Oswald obtained a room in Dallas\r\nand found employment in Dallas, but spent weekends with his family at\r\nthe Paine home.[C6-366] On November 1 and 5, Ruth Paine was interviewed\r\nby agents of the FBI who were investigating Oswald’s activities since\r\nhis return from the Soviet Union, as set forth in greater detail in\r\nchapter VIII. She did not then know Oswald’s address in Dallas.[C6-367]\r\nShe was not asked for, nor did she volunteer, Oswald’s telephone number\r\nin Dallas, which she did know.[C6-368] She advised the Bureau agent to\r\nwhom she spoke of Oswald’s periodic weekend visits, and she informed\r\nhim that Oswald was employed at the Texas School Book Depository\r\nBuilding.[C6-369]\r\n\r\nOn November 10, Ruth Paine discovered a draft of Oswald’s letter\r\nwritten the day before to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, in which\r\nhe indicated that he had journeyed to Mexico City and conferred with\r\na “comrade Kostine in the Embassy of the Soviet Union, Mexico City,\r\nMexico.”[C6-370] (This letter is discussed later in this chapter.)\r\nMr. and Mrs. Paine testified that although they initially assumed the\r\nletter was a figment of Oswald’s imagination, the letter gave Mrs.\r\nPaine considerable misgivings.[C6-371] She determined that if the FBI\r\nagents returned she would deliver to them the copy of a draft of the\r\nletter which, unknown to Oswald, she had made.[C6-372] However, the\r\nagents did not return before the assassination.[C6-373] On November 19,\r\nMrs. Paine learned that Oswald was living in his Dallas rooming-house\r\nunder an assumed name.[C6-374] She did not report this to the FBI\r\nbecause, as she testified, she “had no occasion to see them, and * * *\r\ndid not think it important enough to call them after that until the 23d\r\nof November.”[C6-375]\r\n\r\nThe Commission has thoroughly investigated the background of both\r\nPaines. Mrs. Paine was born Ruth Hyde in New York City on September 3,\r\n1932. Her parents moved to Columbus, Ohio, in the late 1930’s.[C6-376]\r\nThey were divorced in 1961.[C6-377] Ruth Paine graduated from Antioch\r\nCollege in 1955.[C6-378] While in high school she first became\r\ninterested in Quaker activities; she and her brother became Quakers\r\nin 1951.[C6-379] In 1952, following completion of her sophomore year\r\nat Antioch College, she was a delegate to two Friends conferences in\r\nEngland.[C6-380]\r\n\r\nAt the time the Paines met in 1955, Mrs. Paine was active in the work\r\nof the Young Friends Committee of North America, which, with the\r\ncooperation of the Department of State, was making an effort to lessen\r\nthe tensions between Soviet Russia and the United States by means of\r\nthe stimulation of contacts and exchange of cultures between citizens\r\nof the two nations through “pen-pal” correspondence and exchanges of\r\nyoung Russians and Americans.[C6-381] It was during this period that\r\nMrs. Paine became interested in the Russian language.[C6-382] Mrs.\r\nPaine participated in a Russian-American student exchange program\r\nsponsored by the Young Friends Committee of North America, and has\r\nparticipated in the “pen-pal” phase of the activities of the Young\r\nFriends Committee.[C6-383] She has corresponded until recently with a\r\nschoolteacher in Russia.[C6-384] Although her active interest in the\r\nFriends’ program for the lessening of East-West tensions ceased upon\r\nher marriage in December 1957, she has continued to hold to the tenets\r\nof the Quaker faith.[C6-385]\r\n\r\nMichael Paine is the son of George Lyman Paine and Ruth Forbes\r\nPaine, now Ruth Forbes Young, wife of Arthur Young of Philadelphia,\r\nPa.[C6-386] His parents were divorced when he was 4 years of age.\r\nHis father, George Lyman Paine, is an architect and resides in\r\nCalifornia.[C6-387] Michael Paine testified that during his late\r\ngrammar and early high school days his father participated actively in\r\nthe Trotskyite faction of the Communist movement in the United States\r\nand that he attended some of those meetings.[C6-388] He stated that\r\nhis father, with whom he has had little contact throughout most of his\r\nlife, has not influenced his political thinking. He said that he has\r\nvisited his father four or five times in California since 1959, but\r\ntheir discussions did not include the subject of communism.[C6-389]\r\nSince moving to Irving, Tex., in 1959, he has been a research engineer\r\nfor Bell Helicopter Co. in Fort Worth.[C6-390] Mr. Paine has security\r\nclearance for his work.[C6-391] He has been a long-time member of the\r\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union.[C6-392] Though not in sympathy with\r\nrightist political aims, he has attended a few meetings of far-right\r\norganizations in Dallas for the purpose, he testified, of learning\r\nsomething about those organizations and because he “was interested in\r\nseeing more communication between the right and the left.”[C6-393]\r\n\r\nThe Commission has conducted a thorough investigation of the Paines’\r\nfinances and is satisfied that their income has been from legitimate\r\nand traceable sources, and that their expenditures were consistent with\r\ntheir income and for normal purposes. Although in the course of their\r\nrelationship with the Oswalds, the Paines assumed expenses for such\r\nmatters as food and transportation, with a value of approximately $500,\r\nthey made no direct payments to, and received no moneys or valuables\r\nfrom, the Oswalds.[C6-394]\r\n\r\nAlthough prior to November 22, Mrs. Paine had information relating\r\nto Oswald’s use of an alias in Dallas, his telephone number, and\r\nhis correspondence with the Soviet Embassy, which she did not pass\r\non to the FBI,[C6-395] her failure to have come forward with this\r\ninformation must be viewed within the context of the information\r\navailable to her at that time. There is no evidence to contradict her\r\ntestimony that she did not then know about Oswald’s attack on General\r\nWalker, the presence of the rifle on the floor of her garage, Oswald’s\r\nownership of a pistol, or the photographs of Oswald displaying the\r\nfirearms.[C6-396] She thus assumed that Oswald, though a difficult and\r\ndisturbing personality, was not potentially violent, and that the FBI\r\nwas cognizant of his past history and current activities.[C6-397]\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is from Mrs. Paine herself that the Commission has\r\nlearned that she possessed the information which she did have. Mrs.\r\nPaine was forthright with the agent of the FBI with whom she spoke\r\nin early November 1963, providing him with sufficient information to\r\nhave located Oswald at his job if he had deemed it necessary to do\r\nso,[C6-398] and her failure to have taken immediate steps to notify the\r\nBureau of the additional information does not under the circumstances\r\nappear unusual. Throughout the Commission’s investigation, Ruth\r\nPaine has been completely cooperative, voluntarily producing all\r\ncorrespondence, memoranda, and other written communications in her\r\npossession that had passed between her and Marina Oswald both before\r\nand after November 22, 1963.[C6-399] The Commission has had the benefit\r\nof Mrs. Paine’s 1963 date book and calendar and her address book and\r\ntelephone notation book, in both of which appear many entries relating\r\nto her activities with the Oswalds.[C6-400] Other material of a purely\r\npersonal nature was also voluntarily made available.[C6-401] The\r\nCommission has found nothing in the Paines’ background, activities, or\r\nfinances which suggests disloyalty to the United States,[C6-402] and it\r\nhas concluded that Ruth and Michael Paine were not involved in any way\r\nwith the assassination of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nA fuller narrative of the social contacts between the Oswalds and the\r\nvarious persons of the Dallas-Fort Worth community is incorporated\r\nin chapter VII and appendix XIII, and the testimony of all members\r\nof the group who testified before the Commission is included in the\r\nprinted record which accompanies the report. The evidence establishes\r\nthat the Oswalds’ contacts with these people were originated and\r\nmaintained under normal and understandable circumstances. The files\r\nmaintained by the FBI contain no information indicating that any of the\r\npersons in the Dallas-Fort Worth community with whom Oswald associated\r\nwere affiliated with any Communist, Fascist, or other subversive\r\norganization.[C6-403] During the course of this investigation, the\r\nCommission has found nothing which suggests the involvement of any\r\nmember of the Russian-speaking community in Oswald’s preparations to\r\nassassinate President Kennedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical Activities Upon Return to the United States\r\n\r\nUpon his return from the Soviet Union, Oswald had dealings with the\r\nCommunist Party, U.S.A., the Socialist Workers Party, and the Fair\r\nPlay for Cuba Committee, and he also had minor contacts with at least\r\ntwo other organizations with political interests. For the purpose\r\nof determining whether Oswald received any advice, encouragement,\r\nor assistance from these organizations in planning or executing the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy, the Commission has conducted a full\r\ninvestigation of the nature and extent of Oswald’s relations with them.\r\nThe Commission has also conducted an investigation to determine whether\r\ncertain persons and organizations expressing hostility to President\r\nKennedy prior to the assassination had any connection with Lee Harvey\r\nOswald or with the shooting of the President.\r\n\r\n_Communist Party, U.S.A.; Socialist Workers Party._--In August of 1962,\r\nOswald subscribed to the Worker, a publication of the Communist Party,\r\nU.S.A.[C6-404] He also wrote the Communist Party to obtain pamphlets\r\nand other literature which, the evidence indicates, were sent to him\r\nas a matter of course.[C6-405]\r\n\r\nOswald also attempted to initiate other dealings with the Communist\r\nParty, U.S.A., but the organization was not especially responsive.\r\nFrom New Orleans, he informed the party of his activities in\r\nconnection with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, discussed below,\r\nsubmitting membership cards in his fictitious chapter to several party\r\nofficials.[C6-406] In a letter from Arnold S. Johnson, director of\r\nthe information and lecture bureau of the party, Oswald was informed\r\nthat although the Communist Party had no “organizational ties” with\r\nthe committee, the party issued much literature which was “important\r\nfor anybody who is concerned about developments in Cuba.”[C6-407] In\r\nSeptember 1963 Oswald inquired how he might contact the party when\r\nhe relocated in the Baltimore-Washington area, as he said he planned\r\nto do in October, and Johnson suggested in a letter of September 19\r\nthat he “get in touch with us here [New York] and we will find some\r\nway of getting in touch with you in that city [Baltimore].”[C6-408]\r\nHowever, Oswald had also written asking whether, “handicapped as it\r\nwere, by * * * [his] past record,” he could “still * * * compete with\r\nantiprogressive forces, above ground or whether in your opinion * * *\r\n[he] should always remain in the background, i.e., underground,” and in\r\nthe September 19 letter received the reply that “often it is advisable\r\nfor some people to remain in the background, not underground.”[C6-409]\r\n\r\nIn a letter postmarked November 1, Oswald informed the party that\r\nhe had moved to Dallas, and reported his attendance at a meeting at\r\nwhich General Walker had spoken, and at a meeting of the American\r\nCivil Liberties Union; he asked Johnson for the party’s “general view”\r\nof the latter organization and “to what degree, if any, [he] should\r\nattempt to highten its progressive tendencies.” According to Johnson,\r\nthis letter was not received by the Communist Party until after the\r\nassassination.[C6-410] At different times, Oswald also wrote the\r\nWorker and the Hall-Davis Defense Committee, enclosing samples of his\r\nphotographic work and offering to assist in preparing posters; he was\r\ntold that “his kind offer [was] most welcomed and from time to time we\r\nshall call on you,” but he was never asked for assistance.[C6-411] The\r\ncorrespondence between Oswald and the Communist Party, and with all\r\nother organizations, is printed in the record accompanying this report.\r\n\r\nWhen Oswald applied for a visa to enter Cuba during his trip to\r\nMexico City, discussed below,[C6-412] Senora Silvia Duran, the Cuban\r\nconsular employee who dealt with Oswald, wrote on the application\r\nthat Oswald said he was a member of the Communist Party and that he\r\nhad “displayed documents in proof of his membership.”[C6-413] When\r\nOswald went to Mexico, he is believed to have carried his letters from\r\nthe Soviet Embassy in Washington and from the Communist Party in the\r\nUnited States, his 1959 passport, which contained stamps showing that\r\nhe had lived in Russia for 2½ years, his Russian work permit, his\r\nRussian marriage certificate, membership cards and newspaper clippings\r\npurporting to show his role in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and\r\na prepared statement of his qualifications as a “Marxist.”[C6-414]\r\nBecause of the mass of papers Oswald did present showing his affinity\r\nfor communism, some in the Russian language, which was foreign to\r\nSenora Duran, and because further investigation, discussed below,\r\nindicated that Oswald was not a member of the party, Senora Duran’s\r\nnotation was probably inaccurate.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrest after the assassination, Oswald attempted to contact\r\nJohn J. Abt, a New York attorney, to request Abt to represent him. Abt\r\nwas not in New York at the time, and he was never reached in connection\r\nwith representing Oswald. Abt has testified that he at no time had any\r\ndealings with Oswald and that prior to the assassination he had never\r\nheard of Lee Harvey Oswald.[C6-415]\r\n\r\nAfter his return from the Soviet Union, Oswald also carried on a\r\nlimited correspondence with the Socialist Workers Party. In October\r\nof 1962 he attempted to join the party, but his application was not\r\naccepted since there was then no chapter in the Dallas area.[C6-416]\r\nOswald also wrote the Socialist Workers Party offering his assistance\r\nin preparing posters. From this organization too he received the\r\nresponse that he might be called upon if needed. He was asked for\r\nfurther information about his photographic skills, which he does not\r\nappear to have ever provided.[C6-417] Oswald did obtain literature from\r\nthe Socialist Workers Party, however, and in December 1962 he entered\r\na subscription to the affiliated publication, the Militant.[C6-418]\r\nApparently in March of 1963 Oswald wrote the party of his activities\r\nand submitted a clipping with his letter. In response, he was told that\r\nhis name was being sent to the Young Socialist Alliance for further\r\ncorrespondence, but the files of the alliance apparently contain no\r\nreference to Oswald. Neither the letter nor the clipping which Oswald\r\nsent has been located.[C6-419]\r\n\r\nInvestigation by the Commission has produced no plausible evidence that\r\nLee Harvey Oswald had any other significant contacts with the Communist\r\nParty, U.S.A., the Socialist Workers Party, or with any other extreme\r\nleftist political organization. The FBI and other Federal security\r\nagencies have made a study of their records and files and contacted\r\nnumerous confidential informants of the agencies and have produced no\r\nsuch evidence.[C6-420] The Commission has questioned persons who, as\r\na group, knew Oswald during virtually every phase of his adult life,\r\nand from none of these came any indication that Oswald maintained a\r\nsurreptitious relationship with any organization. Arnold S. Johnson,\r\nof the American Communist Party; James T. Tormey, executive secretary\r\nof the Hall-Davis Defense Committee; and Farrell Dobbs, secretary of\r\nthe Socialist Workers Party, voluntarily appeared before the Commission\r\nand testified under oath that Oswald was not a member of these\r\norganizations and that a thorough search of their files had disclosed\r\nno records relating to Oswald other than those which they produced for\r\nthe Commission.[C6-421] The material that has been disclosed is in all\r\ncases consistent with other data in the possession of the Commission.\r\n\r\n_Socialist Labor Party._--Oswald also wrote to the Socialist Labor\r\nParty in New York in November 1962 requesting literature. Horace\r\nTwiford, a national committeeman at large for the party in the State\r\nof Texas, was informed by the New York headquarters in July 1963 of\r\nOswald’s request, and on September 11, 1963, he did mail literature\r\nto Oswald at his old post office box in Dallas.[C6-422] On his way to\r\nMexico City in September 1963, Oswald attempted to contact Twiford\r\nat his home in Houston; Oswald spoke briefly with Twiford’s wife,\r\nidentifying himself as a member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee,\r\nbut since Twiford was out of town at the time, Oswald was unable\r\nto speak with him.[C6-423] Arnold Peterson, national secretary and\r\ntreasurer of the Socialist Labor Party, has stated that a search of the\r\nrecords of the national headquarters reveals no record pertaining to\r\nOswald; he explained that letters requesting literature are routinely\r\ndestroyed.[C6-424] The Socialist Party-Social Democratic Federation\r\nhas also advised that a review of its records fails to reflect any\r\ninformation or correspondence pertaining to Oswald.[C6-425]\r\n\r\n_Fair Play for Cuba Committee._--During the period Oswald was in New\r\nOrleans, from the end of April to late September 1963, he was engaged\r\nin activity purportedly on behalf of the now defunct Fair Play for\r\nCuba Committee (FPCC), an organization centered in New York which\r\nwas highly critical of U.S. policy toward the Cuban Government under\r\nFidel Castro. In May 1963, after having obtained literature from the\r\nFPCC,[C6-426] Oswald applied for and was granted membership in the\r\norganization.[C6-427] When applying for membership, Oswald wrote\r\nnational headquarters that he had\r\n\r\n    * * * been thinking about renting a small office at my own\r\n    expense for the purpose of forming a F.P.C.C. branch here in\r\n    New Orleans.\r\n\r\n    Could you give me a charter?[C6-428]\r\n\r\nWith his membership card, Oswald apparently received a copy of the\r\nconstitution and bylaws for FPCC chapters, and a letter, dated May 29,\r\nwhich read in part as follows (with spelling as in original):\r\n\r\n    It would be hard to concieve of a chapter with as few members\r\n    as seem to exist in the New Orleans area. I have just gone\r\n    through our files and find that Louisiana seams somewhat\r\n    restricted for Fair Play activities. However, with what is\r\n    there perhaps you could build a larger group if a few people\r\n    would undertake the disciplined responsibility of concrete\r\n    organizational work.\r\n\r\n    We certainly are not at all adverse to a very small Chapter\r\n    but certainly would expect that there would be at least twice\r\n    the amount needed to conduct a legal executive board for the\r\n    Chapter. Should this be reasonable we could readily issue a\r\n    charter for a New Orleans Chapter of FPCC. In fact, we would\r\n    be very, very pleased to see this take place and would like to\r\n    do everything possible to assist in bringing it about.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    You must realize that you will come under tremendous pressures\r\n    with any attempt to do FPCC work in that area and that you will\r\n    not be able to operate in the manner which is conventional\r\n    here in the north-east. Even most of our big city Chapters\r\n    have been forced to Abandon the idea of operating an office in\r\n    public. * * * Most Chapters have discovered that it is easier\r\n    to operate semi-privately out of a home and maintain a P.O.\r\n    Box for all mailings and public notices. (A P.O. Box is a must\r\n    for any Chapter in the organization to guarnatee the continued\r\n    contact with the national even if an individual should move or\r\n    drop out.) We do have a serious and often violent opposition\r\n    and this proceedure helps prevent many unnecessary incidents\r\n    which frighten away prospective supporters. I definitely\r\n    would not recommend an office, at least not one that will be\r\n    easily identifyable to the lunatic fringe in your community.\r\n    Certainly, I would not recommend that you engage in one at the\r\n    very beginning but wait and see how you can operate in the\r\n    community through several public experiences.[C6-429]\r\n\r\nThereafter Oswald informed national headquarters that he had opened\r\npost office box No. 30061, and that against its advice he had decided\r\n“to take an office from the very beginning”; he also submitted copies\r\nof a membership application form and a circular headed “Hands Off\r\nCuba!” which he had had printed, and informed the headquarters that he\r\nintended to have membership cards for his chapter printed, which he\r\nsubsequently did.[C6-430] He wrote three further letters to the New\r\nYork office to inform it of his continued activities.[C6-431] In one\r\nhe reported that he had been evicted from the office he claimed to\r\nhave opened, so that he “worked out of a post office box and by useing\r\nstreet demonstrations and some circular work * * * sustained a great\r\ndeal of interest but no new members.”[C6-432]\r\n\r\nOswald did distribute the handbills he had printed on at least\r\nthree occasions.[C6-433] Once, while doing so, he was arrested and\r\nfined for being involved in a disturbance with anti-Castro Cuban\r\nrefugees,[C6-434] one of whom he had previously met by presenting\r\nhimself as hostile to Premier Castro in an apparent effort to\r\ngain information about anti-Castro organizations operating in New\r\nOrleans.[C6-435] When arrested, he informed the police that his\r\nchapter had 35 members.[C6-436] His activities received some attention\r\nin the New Orleans press, and he twice appeared on a local radio\r\nprogram representing himself as a spokesman for the Fair Play for Cuba\r\nCommittee.[C6-437] After his return to Dallas, he listed the FPCC as an\r\norganization authorized to receive mail at his post office box.[C6-438]\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite these activities, the FPCC chapter which Oswald purportedly\r\nformed in New Orleans was entirely fictitious. Vincent T. Lee, formerly\r\nnational director of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, has testified\r\nthat the New York office did not authorize the creation of a New\r\nOrleans chapter, nor did it provide Oswald with funds to support his\r\nactivities there.[C6-439] The national office did not write Oswald\r\nagain after its letter of May 29. As discussed more fully in chapter\r\nVII, Oswald’s later letters to the national office purporting to inform\r\nit of his progress in New Orleans contained numerous exaggerations\r\nabout the scope of his activities and the public reaction to\r\nthem.[C6-440] There is no evidence that Oswald ever opened an office as\r\nhe claimed to have done. Although a pamphlet taken from him at the time\r\nof his arrest in New Orleans contains the rubber stamp imprint “FPCC,\r\n544 CAMP ST., NEW ORLEANS, LA.,” investigation has indicated that\r\nneither the Fair Play for Cuba Committee nor Lee Harvey Oswald ever\r\nmaintained an office at that address.[C6-441] The handbills and other\r\nmaterials bearing the name of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee were\r\nprinted commercially by Oswald without the approval of the national\r\nheadquarters.[C6-442] Oswald’s membership card in the “New Orleans\r\nchapter” of the committee carried the signature of “A. J. Hidell,”\r\npurportedly the president of the chapter, but there is no evidence that\r\nan “A. J. Hidell” existed and, as pointed out in chapter IV, there is\r\nconclusive evidence that the name was an alias which Oswald used on\r\nvarious occasions. Marina Oswald herself wrote the name “Hidell” on the\r\nmembership card at her husband’s insistence.[C6-443]\r\n\r\nNo other member of the so-called New Orleans chapter of the committee\r\nhas ever been found. The only occasion on which anyone other than\r\nOswald was observed taking part in these activities was on August 9,\r\n1963, when Oswald and two young men passed out leaflets urging “Hands\r\nOff Cuba!” on the streets of New Orleans. One of the two men, who was\r\n16 years old at the time, has testified that Oswald approached him\r\nat the Louisiana State Employment Commission and offered him $2 for\r\nabout an hour’s work. He accepted the offer but later, when he noticed\r\nthat television cameras were being focused on him, he obtained his\r\nmoney and left. He testified that he had never seen Oswald before and\r\nnever saw him again. The second individual has never been located; but\r\naccording to the testimony of the youth who was found, he too seemed\r\nto be someone not previously connected with Oswald.[C6-444] Finally,\r\nthe FBI has advised the Commission that its information on undercover\r\nCuban activities in the New Orleans area reveals no knowledge of Oswald\r\nbefore the assassination.[C6-445]\r\n\r\n_Right-wing groups hostile to President Kennedy._--The Commission also\r\nconsidered the possibility that there may have been a link between\r\nOswald and certain groups which had bitterly denounced President\r\nKennedy and his policies prior to the time of the President’s trip to\r\nDallas. As discussed in chapter II, two provocative incidents took\r\nplace concurrently with President Kennedy’s visit and a third but a\r\nmonth prior thereto. The incidents were (1) the demonstration against\r\nthe Honorable Adlai E. Stevenson, U.S. Ambassador to the United\r\nNations, in late October 1963, when he came to Dallas on United Nations\r\nDay; (2) the publication in the Dallas Morning News on November 22 of\r\nthe full page, black-bordered paid advertisement entitled, “Welcome Mr.\r\nKennedy”; and (3) the distribution of a throwaway handbill entitled\r\n“Wanted for Treason” throughout Dallas on November 20 and 21. Oswald\r\nwas aware of the Stevenson incident; there is no evidence that he\r\nbecame aware of either the “Welcome Mr. Kennedy” advertisement or\r\nthe “Wanted for Treason” handbill, though neither possibility can be\r\nprecluded.\r\n\r\nThe only evidence of interest on Oswald’s part in rightist groups in\r\nDallas was his alleged attendance at a rally at the Dallas Auditorium\r\nthe evening preceding Ambassador Stevenson’s address on United Nations\r\nDay, October 24, 1963. On the evening of October 25, 1963, at the\r\ninvitation of Michael Paine, Oswald attended a monthly meeting of the\r\nDallas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union in which he was\r\nlater to seek membership.[C6-446] During the course of the discussion\r\nat this meeting, a speaker mentioned Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker\r\n(Resigned, U.S. Army). Oswald arose in the midst of the meeting to\r\nremark that a “night or two nights before” he had attended a meeting at\r\nwhich General Walker had spoken in terms that led Oswald to assert that\r\nGeneral Walker was both anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic.[C6-447] General\r\nWalker testified that he had been the speaker at a rally the night\r\nbefore Ambassador Stevenson’s appearance, but that he did not know and\r\nhad never heard of Oswald prior to the announcement of his name on\r\nradio and television on the afternoon of November 22.[C6-448] Oswald\r\nconfirmed his attendance at the U.S. Day rally in an undated letter he\r\nwrote to Arnold Johnson, director of the information and lecture bureau\r\nof the Communist Party, mailed November 1, 1963, in which he reported:\r\n\r\n    On October 23rd, I had attended a ultra-right meeting headed by\r\n    General Edwin a. Walker, who lives in Dallas.\r\n\r\n    This meeting preceded by one day the attack on a. e. Stevenson\r\n    at the United Nations Day meeting at which he spoke.\r\n\r\n    As you can see, political friction between ‘left’ and ‘right’\r\n    is very great here.[C6-449]\r\n\r\nIn the light of Oswald’s attack upon General Walker on the evening of\r\nApril 10, 1963, discussed in chapter IV,[C6-450] as well as Oswald’s\r\nknown political views,[C6-451] his asserted attendance at the political\r\nrally at which General Walker spoke may have been induced by many\r\npossible motives. However, there is no evidence that Oswald attended\r\nany other rightist meetings or was associated with any politically\r\nconservative organizations.\r\n\r\nWhile the black-bordered “Welcome Mr. Kennedy” advertisement in\r\nthe November 22 Dallas Morning News, which addressed a series of\r\ncritical questions to the President, probably did not come to Oswald’s\r\nattention, it was of interest to the Commission because of its\r\nappearance on the day of the assassination and because of an allegation\r\nmade before the Commission concerning the person whose name appeared\r\nas the chairman of the committee sponsoring the advertisement.\r\nThe black-bordered advertisement was purported to be sponsored by\r\n“The American Fact-Finding Committee,” which was described as “An\r\nunaffiliated and nonpartisan group of citizens who wish truth.” Bernard\r\nWeissman was listed as “Chairman” and a post office box in Dallas was\r\nthe only address. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1031, p. 294.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1031]\r\n\r\nThe Commission has conducted a full investigation into the genesis of\r\nthis advertisement and the background of those responsible for it.\r\nThree of the four men chiefly responsible, Bernard W. Weissman, William\r\nB. Burley III, and Larrie H. Schmidt, had served together in the U.S.\r\nArmy in Munich, Germany, in 1962. During that time they had with\r\nothers devised plans to develop two conservative organizations, one\r\npolitical and the other business. The political entity was to be named\r\nConservatism--USA, or CUSA, and the business entity was to be named\r\nAmerican Business, or AMBUS.[C6-452] While in Munich, according to\r\nWeissman, they attempted to develop in their “own minds * * * ways to\r\nbuild up various businesses that would support us and at the same time\r\nsupport our political activities.”[C6-453] According to a subsequent\r\nletter from Schmidt to Weissman, “Cusa was founded for patriotic\r\nreasons rather than for personal gain--even though, as a side effect,\r\nAmbus was to have brought great return, as any business endeavor\r\nshould.”[C6-454] To establish their organizations, Weissman testified\r\nthat they:\r\n\r\n    * * * had planned while in Munich that in order to accomplish\r\n    our goals, to try to do it from scratch would be almost\r\n    impossible, because it would be years before we could even get\r\n    the funds to develop a powerful organization. So we had planned\r\n    to infiltrate various rightwing organizations and by our own\r\n    efforts become involved in the hierarchy of these various\r\n    organizations and eventually get ourselves elected or appointed\r\n    to various higher offices in these organizations, and by doing\r\n    this bring in some of our own people, and eventually take over\r\n    the leadership of these organizations, and at that time having\r\n    our people in these various organizations, we would then, you\r\n    might say, call a conference and have them unite, and while no\r\n    one knew of the existence of CUSA aside from us, we would then\r\n    bring them all together, unite them, and arrange to have it\r\n    called CUSA.[C6-455]\r\n\r\nSchmidt was the first to leave the service; settling in Dallas in\r\nOctober 1962, he became a life insurance salesman and quickly engaged\r\nin numerous political activities in pursuit of the objectives devised\r\nin Munich.[C6-456] He became affiliated with several organizations and\r\nprepared various political writings.[C6-457]\r\n\r\nUpon their release from the military, Weissman and Burley did not\r\nimmediately move to Dallas, though repeatedly urged to do so by\r\nSchmidt.[C6-458] On October 1, 1963, Schmidt wrote Weissman: “Adlai\r\nStevenson is scheduled here on the 24th on UN Day. Kennedy is scheduled\r\nin Dallas on Nov. 24th. There are to be protests. All the big things\r\nare happening _now_--if we don’t get in right now we may as well\r\nforget it.”[C6-459] The day of the Stevenson demonstration, Schmidt\r\ntelephoned Weissman, again urging him to move to Dallas. Recalling that\r\nconversation with Schmidt, Weissman testified:\r\n\r\n    And he said, “If we are going to take advantage of the\r\n    situation * * * you better hurry down here and take advantage\r\n    of the publicity, and at least become known among these various\r\n    right-wingers, because this is the chance we have been looking\r\n    for to infiltrate some of these organizations and become\r\n    known,” in other words, go along with the philosophy we had\r\n    developed in Munich.[C6-460]\r\n\r\nFive days later he wrote to Weissman and Burley to report that as\r\nthe “only organizer of the demonstration to have publicly identified\r\nhimself,” he had “become, overnight, a ‘fearless spokesman’ and\r\n‘leader’ of the rightwing in Dallas. What I worked so hard for in one\r\nyear--and nearly failed--finally came through one incident in one\r\nnight!” He ended, “Politically, CUSA is set. It is now up to you to get\r\nAmbus going.”[C6-461]\r\n\r\nWeissman and Burley accepted Schmidt’s prompting and traveled to\r\nDallas, arriving on November 4, 1963.[C6-462] Both obtained employment\r\nas carpet salesmen. At Schmidt’s solicitation they took steps to join\r\nthe John Birch Society, and through Schmidt they met the fourth person\r\ninvolved in placing the November 22 advertisement, Joseph P. Grinnan,\r\nDallas independent oil operator and a John Birch Society coordinator in\r\nthe Dallas area.[C6-463]\r\n\r\nWithin a week to 10 days after Weissman and Burley had arrived in\r\nDallas, the four men began to consider plans regarding President\r\nKennedy’s planned visit to Dallas.[C6-464] Weissman explained the\r\nreason for which it was decided that the ad should be placed:\r\n\r\n    * * * after the Stevenson incident, it was felt that a\r\n    demonstration would be entirely out of order, because we\r\n    didn’t want anything to happen in the way of physical violence\r\n    to President Kennedy when he came to Dallas. But we thought\r\n    that the conservatives in Dallas--I was told--were a pretty\r\n    downtrodden lot after that, because they were being oppressed\r\n    by the local liberals, because of the Stevenson incident. We\r\n    felt we had to do something to build up the morale of the\r\n    conservative element, in Dallas. So we hit upon the idea of the\r\n    ad.[C6-465]\r\n\r\nWeissman, Schmidt, and Grinnan worked on the text for the\r\nadvertisement.[C6-466] A pamphlet containing 50 questions critical\r\nof American policy was employed for this purpose, and was the source\r\nof the militant questions contained in the ad attacking President\r\nKennedy’s administration.[C6-467] Grinnan undertook to raise the\r\n$1,465 needed to pay for the ad.[C6-468] He employed a typed draft of\r\nthe advertisement to support his funds solicitation.[C6-469] Grinnan\r\nraised the needed money from three wealthy Dallas businessmen: Edgar\r\nR. Crissey, Nelson Bunker Hunt, and H. R. Bright, some of whom in\r\nturn collected contributions from others.[C6-470] At least one of\r\nthe contributors would not make a contribution unless a question he\r\nsuggested was inserted.[C6-471] Weissman, believing that Schmidt,\r\nGrinnan, and the contributors were active members of the John Birch\r\nSociety, and that Grinnan eventually took charge of the project,\r\nexpressed the opinion that the advertisement was the creation of the\r\nJohn Birch Society,[C6-472] though Schmidt and Grinnan have maintained\r\nthat they were acting “solely as individuals.”[C6-473]\r\n\r\nA fictitious sponsoring organization was invented out of whole\r\ncloth.[C6-474] The name chosen for the supposed organization was The\r\nAmerican Fact-Finding Committee.[C6-475] This was “Solely a name,”\r\nWeissman testified; “* * * As a matter of fact, when I went to place\r\nthe ad, I could not remember the name * * * I had to refer to a piece\r\nof paper for the name.”[C6-476] Weissman’s own name was used on the\r\nad in part to counter charges of anti-Semitism which had been leveled\r\nagainst conservative groups in Dallas.[C6-477] Weissman conceived\r\nthe idea of using a black border,[C6-478] and testified he intended\r\nit to serve the function of stimulating reader attention.[C6-479]\r\nBefore accepting the advertisement, the Dallas Morning News apparently\r\nsubmitted it to its attorneys for their opinion as to whether its\r\npublication might subject them to liability.[C6-480]\r\n\r\nWeissman testified that the advertisement drew 50 or 60 mailed\r\nresponses.[C6-481] He took them from the post office box early on\r\nSunday morning, November 24.[C6-482] He said that those postmarked\r\nbefore the attack on President Kennedy were “favorable” in\r\ntone;[C6-483] those of later postmark were violently unfavorable,\r\nnasty, and threatening;[C6-484] and, according to a report from\r\nSchmidt, those postmarked some weeks later were again of favorable\r\ntone.[C6-485]\r\n\r\nThe four promoters of the ad deny that they had any knowledge of or\r\nfamiliarity with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to November 22, or Jack Ruby\r\nprior to November 24.[C6-486] Each has provided a statement of his\r\nrole in connection with the placement of the November 22 advertisement\r\nand other matters, and investigation has revealed no deception.\r\nThe Commission has found no evidence that any of these persons was\r\nconnected with Oswald or Ruby, or was linked to a conspiracy to\r\nassassinate President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nThe advertisement, however, did give rise to one allegation concerning\r\nBernard Weissman which required additional investigation. On March 4,\r\n1964, Mark Lane, a New York attorney, testified before the Commission\r\nthat an undisclosed informant had told him that Weissman had met\r\nwith Jack Ruby and Patrolman J. D. Tippit at Ruby’s Carousel Club on\r\nNovember 14, 1963. Lane declined to state the name of his informant\r\nbut said that he would attempt to obtain his informant’s permission\r\nto reveal his name.[C6-487] On July 2, 1964, after repeated requests\r\nby the Commission that he disclose the name of his informant, Lane\r\ntestified a second time concerning this matter, but declined to\r\nreveal the information, stating as his reason that he had promised\r\nthe individual that his name would not be revealed without his\r\npermission.[C6-488] Lane also made this allegation during a radio\r\nappearance, whereupon Weissman twice demanded that Lane reveal the name\r\nof the informant.[C6-489] As of the date of this report Lane has failed\r\nto reveal the name of his informant and has offered no evidence to\r\nsupport his allegation. The Commission has investigated the allegation\r\nof a Weissman-Ruby-Tippit meeting and has found no evidence that such\r\na meeting took place anywhere at any time. The investigation into this\r\nmatter is discussed in a later section of this chapter dealing with\r\npossible conspiracies involving Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nA comparable incident was the appearance of the “Wanted for Treason”\r\nhandbill on the streets of Dallas 1 to 2 days before President\r\nKennedy’s arrival. These handbills bore a reproduction of a front\r\nand profile photograph of the President and set forth a series of\r\ninflammatory charges against him.[C6-490] Efforts to locate the\r\nauthor and the lithography printer of the handbill at first met with\r\nevasive responses[C6-491] and refusals to furnish information.[C6-492]\r\nRobert A. Surrey was eventually identified as the author of the\r\nhandbill.[C6-493] Surrey, a 38-year-old printing salesman employed\r\nby Johnson Printing Co. of Dallas, Tex., has been closely associated\r\nwith General Walker for several years in his political and business\r\nactivities.[C6-494] He is president of American Eagle Publishing Co.\r\nof Dallas, in which he is a partner with General Walker.[C6-495] Its\r\noffice and address is the post office box of Johnson Printing Co. Its\r\nassets consist of cash and various printed materials composed chiefly\r\nof General Walker’s political and promotional literature,[C6-496] all\r\nof which is stored at General Walker’s headquarters.[C6-497]\r\n\r\nSurrey prepared the text for the handbill and apparently used Johnson\r\nPrinting Co. facilities to set the type and print a proof.[C6-498]\r\nSurrey induced Klause, a salesman employed by Lettercraft Printing\r\nCo. of Dallas,[C6-499] whom Surrey had met when both were employed\r\nat Johnson Printing Co.,[C6-500] to print the handbill “on the\r\nside.”[C6-501] According to Klause, Surrey contacted him initially\r\napproximately 2 or 2½ weeks prior to November 22.[C6-502] About a\r\nweek prior to November 22, Surrey delivered to Klause two slick paper\r\nmagazine prints of photographs of a front view and profile of President\r\nKennedy,[C6-503] together with the textual page proof.[C6-504] Klause\r\nwas unable to make the photographic negative of the prints needed to\r\nprepare the photographic printing plate,[C6-505] so that he had this\r\nfeature of the job done at a local shop.[C6-506] Klause then arranged\r\nthe halftone front and profile representations of President Kennedy at\r\nthe top of the textual material he had received from Surrey so as to\r\nsimulate a “man wanted” police placard. He then made a photographic\r\nprinting plate of the picture.[C6-507] During the night, he and his\r\nwife surreptitiously printed approximately 5,000 copies on Lettercraft\r\nPrinting Co. offset printing equipment without the knowledge of his\r\nemployers.[C6-508] The next day he arranged with Surrey a meeting\r\nplace, and delivered the handbills.[C6-509] Klause’s charge for the\r\nprinting of the handbills was, including expenses, $60.[C6-510]\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the investigation Klause stated to Federal agents\r\nthat he did not know the name of his customer, whom he incorrectly\r\ndescribed;[C6-511] he did say, however, that the customer did not\r\nresemble either Oswald or Ruby.[C6-512] Shortly before he appeared\r\nbefore the Commission, Klause disclosed Surrey’s identity.[C6-513] He\r\nexplained that no record of the transaction had been made because “he\r\nsaw a chance to make a few dollars on the side.”[C6-514]\r\n\r\nKlause’s testimony receives some corroboration from Bernard Weissman’s\r\ntestimony that he saw a copy of one of the “Wanted for Treason”\r\nhandbills on the floor of General Walker’s station wagon shortly after\r\nNovember 22.[C6-515] Other details of the manner in which the handbills\r\nwere printed have also been verified.[C6-516] Moreover, Weissman\r\ntestified that neither he nor any of his associates had anything to do\r\nwith the handbill or were acquainted with Surrey, Klause, Lettercraft\r\nPrinting Co., or Johnson Printing Co.[C6-517] Klause and Surrey, as\r\nwell as General Walker, testified that they were unacquainted with\r\nLee Harvey Oswald and had not heard of him prior to the afternoon\r\nof November 22.[C6-518] The Commission has found no evidence of any\r\nconnection between those responsible for the handbill and Lee Harvey\r\nOswald or the assassination.\r\n\r\n\r\nContacts With the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City and the\r\nSoviet Embassy in Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nEight weeks before the assassination, Oswald traveled to Mexico City\r\nwhere he visited both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies.[D] Oswald’s wife\r\nknew of this trip before he went,[C6-519] but she denied such knowledge\r\nuntil she testified before the Commission.[C6-520] The Commission\r\nundertook an intensive investigation to determine Oswald’s purpose and\r\nactivities on this journey, with specific reference to reports that\r\nOswald was an agent of the Cuban or Soviet Governments. As a result of\r\nits investigation, the Commission believes that it has been able to\r\nreconstruct and explain most of Oswald’s actions during this time. A\r\ndetailed chronological account of this trip appears in appendix XIII.\r\n\r\n    [D] The Soviet Embassy in Mexico City includes consular as\r\n        well as diplomatic personnel in a single building. The\r\n        Cuban Embassy and Cuban Consulate in Mexico City, though\r\n        in separate buildings, are in the same compound. Both the\r\n        Soviet and the Cuban establishments will be referred to\r\n        throughout the report simply as Embassies.\r\n\r\n_Trip to Mexico._--Oswald was in Mexico from September 26, 1963, until\r\nOctober 3, 1963.[C6-521] (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 2478, 2481, p.\r\n300.) Marina Oswald testified that Oswald had told her that the purpose\r\nof the trip was to evade the American prohibition on travel to Cuba and\r\nto reach that country.[C6-522] He cautioned her that the trip and its\r\npurpose were to be kept strictly secret.[C6-523] She testified that he\r\nhad earlier laid plans to reach Cuba by hijacking an airliner flying\r\nout of New Orleans, but she refused to cooperate and urged him to give\r\nit up, which he finally did.[C6-524] Witnesses who spoke with Oswald\r\nwhile he was on a bus going to Mexico City also testified that Oswald\r\ntold them he intended to reach Cuba by way of Mexico, and that he hoped\r\nto meet Fidel Castro after he arrived.[C6-525] When Oswald spoke to\r\nthe Cuban and Soviet consular officials in Mexico City, he represented\r\nthat he intended to travel to the Soviet Union and requested an\r\n“in-transit” Cuban visa to permit him to enter Cuba on September 30 on\r\nthe way to the Soviet Union. Marina Oswald has testified that these\r\nstatements were deceptions designed to get him to Cuba.[C6-526] Thus,\r\nalthough it is possible that Oswald intended to continue on to Russia\r\nfrom Cuba, the evidence makes it more likely that he intended to remain\r\nin Cuba.[C6-527]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSWALD’S MEXICAN TOURIST CARD AND APPLICATION\r\n\r\n(COMMISSION EXHIBIT 2481)\r\n\r\nAPPLICATION FOR TOURIST CARD\r\n\r\n(COMMISSION EXHIBIT 2478)\r\n\r\nTOURIST CARD]\r\n\r\nOswald departed from New Orleans probably about noon on September 25\r\nand arrived in Mexico City at about 10 a.m. on September 27.[C6-528] In\r\nMexico City he embarked on a series of visits to the Soviet and Cuban\r\nEmbassies, which occupied most of his time during the first 2 days of\r\nhis visit. At the Cuban Embassy, he requested an “in-transit” visa to\r\npermit him to visit Cuba on his way to the Soviet Union.[C6-529] Oswald\r\nwas informed that he could not obtain a visa for entry into Cuba unless\r\nhe first obtained a visa to enter the U.S.S.R.,[C6-530] and the Soviet\r\nEmbassy told him that he could not expect an answer on his application\r\nfor a visa for the Soviet Union for about 4 months.[C6-531] Oswald\r\ncarried with him newspaper clippings, letters and various documents,\r\nsome of them forged or containing false information, purporting to\r\nshow that he was a “friend” of Cuba.[C6-532] With these papers and his\r\nrecord of previous residence in the Soviet Union and marriage to a\r\nSoviet national, he tried to curry favor with both Embassies.[C6-533]\r\nIndeed, his wife testified that in her opinion Oswald’s primary purpose\r\nin having engaged in Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities was to\r\ncreate a public record that he was a “friend” of Cuba.[C6-534] He made\r\nhimself especially unpopular at the Cuban Embassy by persisting in his\r\ndemands that as a sympathizer in Cuban objectives he ought to be given\r\na visa. This resulted in a sharp argument with the consul, Eusebio\r\nAzque.[C6-535]\r\n\r\nBy Saturday, September 28, 1963, Oswald had failed to obtain visas at\r\nboth Embassies.[C6-536] From Sunday, September 29, through Wednesday\r\nmorning, October 2, when he left Mexico City on a bus bound for the\r\nUnited States, Oswald spent considerable time making his travel\r\narrangements, sightseeing and checking again with the Soviet Embassy to\r\nlearn whether anything had happened on his visa application.[C6-537]\r\nMarina Oswald testified that when she first saw him after his return to\r\nthe United States he was disappointed and discouraged at his failure to\r\nreach Cuba.[C6-538]\r\n\r\nThe general outlines of Oswald’s activities in Mexico, particularly the\r\nnature and extent of his contacts at the Cuban Embassy, were learned\r\nvery early in the investigation. An important source of information\r\nrelating to his business at the Cuban Embassy was Senora Silvia Tirado\r\nde Duran, a Mexican national employed in the visa section of the Cuban\r\nEmbassy, who was questioned intensively by Mexican authorities soon\r\nafter the assassination.[C6-539] An excerpt from the report of the\r\nMexican Government summarized the crucial portion of Senora Duran’s\r\nrecollection of Oswald. In translation it reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    * * * she remembered * * * [that Lee Harvey Oswald] was the\r\n    name of an American who had come to the Cuban Consulate to\r\n    obtain a visa to travel to Cuba in transit to Russia, the\r\n    latter part of September or the early part of October of this\r\n    year, and in support of his application had shown his passport,\r\n    in which it was noted that he had lived in that country for a\r\n    period of three years; his labor card from the same country\r\n    written in the Russian language; and letters in that same\r\n    language. He had presented evidence that he was married to\r\n    a Russian woman, and also that he was apparently the leader\r\n    of an organization in the city of New Orleans called “Fair\r\n    * * * [Play] for Cuba,” claiming that he should be accepted\r\n    as a “friend” of the Cuban Revolution. Accordingly, the\r\n    declarant, complying with her duties, took down all of the\r\n    information and completed the appropriate application form;\r\n    and the declarant, admittedly exceeding her responsibilities,\r\n    informally telephoned the Russian consulate, with the intention\r\n    of doing what she could to facilitate issuance of the Russian\r\n    visa to Lee Harvey Oswald. However, they told her that there\r\n    would be a delay of about four months in processing the case,\r\n    which annoyed the applicant since, according to his statement,\r\n    he was in a great hurry to obtain visas that would enable\r\n    him to travel to Russia, insisting on his right to do so in\r\n    view of his background and his loyalty and his activities in\r\n    behalf of the Cuban movement. The declarant was unable to\r\n    recall accurately whether or not the applicant told her he\r\n    was a member of the Communist Party, but he did say that his\r\n    wife * * * was then in New York City, and would follow him, *\r\n    * * [Senora Duran stated] that when Oswald understood that it\r\n    was not possible to give him a Cuban visa without his first\r\n    having obtained the Russian visa, * * * he became very excited\r\n    or angry, and accordingly, the affiant called Consul Ascue\r\n    [sic], * * * [who] came out and began a heated discussion in\r\n    English with Oswald, that concluded by Ascue telling him that\r\n    “if it were up to him, he would not give him the visa,” and “a\r\n    person of his type was harming the Cuban Revolution rather than\r\n    helping it,” it being understood that in their conversation\r\n    they were talking about the Russian Socialist Revolution and\r\n    not the Cuban. Oswald maintained that he had two reasons for\r\n    requesting that his visa be issued promptly, and they were:\r\n    one, that his tourist permit in Mexico was about to expire; and\r\n    the other, that he had to get to Russia as quickly as possible.\r\n    Despite her annoyance, the declarant gave Oswald a paper * * *\r\n    in which she put down her name, “Silvia Durán,” and the\r\n    number of the telephone at the consulate, which is “11-28-47”\r\n    and the visa application was processed anyway. It was sent\r\n    to the Ministry of [Foreign] Relations of Cuba, from which a\r\n    routine reply was received some fifteen to thirty days later,\r\n    approving the visa, but on the condition that the Russian visa\r\n    be obtained first, although she does not recall whether or not\r\n    Oswald later telephoned her at the Consulate number that she\r\n    gave him.[C6-540]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSWALD’S APPLICATION FOR A VISA FOR TRAVEL TO CUBA AND\r\nTHE REPLY OF THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n(COMMISSION EXHIBIT 2564)\r\n\r\nOSWALD’S APPLICATION ——> TRANSLATION\r\n\r\nCUBAN REPLY ——> TRANSLATION\r\n\r\nBOTH DOCUMENTS FURNISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF CUBA.]\r\n\r\nWith the dates of Oswald’s entry into and departure from Mexico,\r\nwhich had been obtained from the records of the Mexican Immigration\r\nService very shortly after the assassination, the Government of Mexico\r\ninitiated a thorough investigation to uncover as much information as\r\npossible on Oswald’s trip.[C6-541] Representatives of U.S. agencies\r\nworked in close liaison with the Mexican law enforcement authorities.\r\nThe result of this investigative effort was to corroborate the\r\nstatements of Senora Duran and to verify the essentials of Oswald’s\r\nactivities in Mexico as outlined above.\r\n\r\nSenora Duran is a well-educated native of Mexico, who was 26 years\r\nold at the time of her interrogation. She is married to Senor Horacio\r\nDuran Navarro, a 40-year-old industrial designer, and has a young\r\nchild. Although Senora Duran denies being a member of the Communist\r\nParty or otherwise connected with it, both Durans have been active in\r\nfar left political affairs in Mexico, believe in Marxist ideology, and\r\nsympathize with the government of Fidel Castro,[C6-542] and Senor Duran\r\nhas written articles for El Dia, a pro-Communist newspaper in Mexico\r\nCity.[C6-543] The Commission has reliable evidence from a confidential\r\nsource that Senora Duran as well as other personnel at the Cuban\r\nEmbassy were genuinely upset upon receiving news of President Kennedy’s\r\ndeath. Senora Duran’s statements were made to Mexican officials soon\r\nafter the assassination,[C6-544] and no significant inaccuracies in\r\nthem have been detected. Documents fitting the description given by\r\nSenora Duran of the documents Oswald had shown her, plus a notation\r\nwhich she said she had given him, were found among his possessions\r\nafter his arrest.[C6-545]\r\n\r\nThe Cuban Government was asked to document and confirm the essentials\r\nof Senora Duran’s testimony. Its response, which has been included\r\nin its entirety in this Report, included a summary statement of\r\nOswald’s activities at the Cuban Embassy;[C6-546] a photograph of the\r\napplication for a visa he completed there,[C6-547] and a photograph\r\nof the communication from Havana rejecting the application unless he\r\ncould first present a Soviet visa.[C6-548] (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n2564, p. 306.) The information on these documents concerning Oswald’s\r\ndate of birth, American passport number and activities and statements\r\nat the Embassy is consistent with other information available to the\r\nCommission.[C6-549] CIA experts have given their opinion that the\r\nhandwriting on the visa application which purports to be Oswald’s\r\nis in fact his and that, although the handwritten notations on\r\nthe bottom of the document are too brief and faint to permit a\r\nconclusive determination, they are probably Senora Duran’s.[C6-550]\r\nThe clothes which Oswald was wearing in the photograph which appears\r\non the application appear to be the same as some of those found\r\namong his effects after the assassination, and the photograph itself\r\nappears to be from the same negative as a photograph found among his\r\neffects.[C6-551] Nothing on any of the documents raises a suspicion\r\nthat they might not be authentic.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important confirmation of Senora Duran’s testimony,\r\nhowever, has been supplied by confidential sources of extremely high\r\nreliability available to the United States in Mexico. The information\r\nfrom these sources establishes that her testimony was truthful and\r\naccurate in all material respects. The identities of these sources\r\ncannot be disclosed without destroying their future usefulness to the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the Commission has produced considerable\r\ntestimonial and documentary evidence establishing the precise time of\r\nOswald’s journey, his means of transportation, the hotel at which he\r\nstayed in Mexico City, and a restaurant at which he often ate. All\r\nknown persons whom Oswald may have met while in Mexico, including\r\npassengers on the buses he rode,[C6-552] and the employees and guests\r\nof the hotel where he stayed,[C6-553] were interviewed. No credible\r\nwitness has been located who saw Oswald with any unidentified person\r\nwhile in Mexico City; to the contrary, he was observed traveling\r\nalone to and from Mexico City,[C6-554] at his hotel,[C6-555] and at\r\nthe nearby restaurant where he frequently ate.[C6-556] A hotel guest\r\nstated that on one occasion he sat down at a table with Oswald at the\r\nrestaurant because no empty table was available, but that neither spoke\r\nto the other because of the language barrier.[C6-557] Two Australian\r\ngirls who saw Oswald on the bus to Mexico City relate that he occupied\r\na seat next to a man who has been identified as Albert Osborne, an\r\nelderly itinerant preacher.[C6-558] Osborne denies that Oswald was\r\nbeside him on the bus.[C6-559] To the other passengers on the bus it\r\nappeared that Osborne and Oswald had not previously met,[C6-560] and\r\nextensive investigation of Osborne has revealed no further contact\r\nbetween him and Oswald. Osborne’s responses to Federal investigators on\r\nmatters unrelated to Oswald have proved inconsistent and unreliable,\r\nand, therefore, based on the contrary evidence and Osborne’s lack of\r\nreliability, the Commission has attached no credence to his denial\r\nthat Oswald was beside him on the bus. Investigation of his background\r\nand activities, however, disclose no basis for suspecting him of any\r\ninvolvement in the assassination.[C6-561]\r\n\r\nInvestigation of the hotel at which Oswald stayed has failed to uncover\r\nany evidence that the hotel is unusual in any way that could relate to\r\nOswald’s visit. It is not especially popular among Cubans, and there\r\nis no indication that it is used as a meeting place for extremist or\r\nrevolutionary organizations.[C6-562] Investigation of other guests of\r\nthe hotel who were there when Oswald was has failed to uncover anything\r\ncreating suspicion.[C6-563] Oswald’s notebook which he carried with him\r\nto Mexico City contained the telephone number of the Cuban Airlines\r\nOffice in Mexico City;[C6-564] however, a Cuban visa is required by\r\nMexican authorities before an individual may enplane for Cuba,[C6-565]\r\nand a confidential check of the Cuban Airlines Office uncovered no\r\nevidence that Oswald visited their offices while in the city.[C6-566]\r\n\r\n_Allegations of conspiracy._--Literally dozens of allegations of\r\na conspiratorial contact between Oswald and agents of the Cuban\r\nGovernment have been investigated by the Commission. Among the\r\nclaims made were allegations that Oswald had made a previous trip to\r\nMexico City in early September to receive money and orders for the\r\nassassination,[C6-567] that he had been flown to a secret airfield\r\nsomewhere in or near the Yucatan Peninsula,[C6-568] that he might\r\nhave made contacts in Mexico City with a Communist from the United\r\nStates shortly before the assassination,[C6-569] and that Oswald\r\nassassinated the President at the direction of a particular Cuban agent\r\nwho met with him in the United States and paid him $7,000.[C6-570]\r\nA letter was received from someone in Cuba alleging the writer had\r\nattended a meeting where the assassination had been discussed as part\r\nof a plan which would soon include the death of other non-Communist\r\nleaders in the Americas.[C6-571] The charge was made in a Cuban\r\nexpatriate publication that in a speech he delivered 5 days after the\r\nassassination, while he was under the influence of liquor, Fidel\r\nCastro made a slip of the tongue and said, “The first time Oswald was\r\nin Cuba,” thereby giving away the fact that Oswald had made one or more\r\nsurreptitious trips to that country.[C6-572]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 1400\r\n\r\nLEE HARVEY OSWALD’S MOVEMENTS IN MEXICO CITY]\r\n\r\nSome stories linked the assassination to anti-Castro groups who\r\nallegedly were engaged in obtaining illicit firearms in the United\r\nStates, one such claim being that these groups killed the President as\r\npart of a bargain with some illicit organizations who would then supply\r\nthem with firearms as payment.[C6-573] Other rumors placed Oswald\r\nin Miami, Fla., at various times, allegedly in pro-Cuban activities\r\nthere.[C6-574] The assassination was claimed to have been carried out\r\nby Chinese Communists operating jointly with the Cubans.[C6-575] Oswald\r\nwas also alleged to have met with the Cuban Ambassador in a Mexico\r\nCity restaurant and to have driven off in the Ambassador’s car for a\r\nprivate talk.[C6-576] Castro himself, it was alleged, 2 days after\r\nthe assassination called for the files relating to Oswald’s dealings\r\nwith two members of the Cuban diplomatic mission in the Soviet Union;\r\nthe inference drawn was that the “dealings” had occurred and had\r\nestablished a secret subversive relationship which continued through\r\nOswald’s life.[C6-577] Without exception, the rumors and allegations of\r\na conspiratorial contact were shown to be without any factual basis, in\r\nsome cases the product of mistaken identification.\r\n\r\nIllustrative of the attention given to the most serious allegations is\r\nthe case of “D,” a young Latin American secret agent who approached\r\nU.S. authorities in Mexico shortly after the assassination and declared\r\nthat he saw Lee Harvey Oswald receiving $6,500 to kill the President.\r\nAmong other details, “D” said that at about noon on September 18,\r\nwaiting to conduct some business at the Cuban consulate, he saw a group\r\nof three persons conversing in a patio a few feet away. One was a\r\ntall, thin Negro with reddish hair, obviously dyed, who spoke rapidly\r\nin both Spanish and English, and another was a man he said was Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald. A tall Cuban joined the group momentarily and passed\r\nsome currency to the Negro. The Negro then allegedly said to Oswald\r\nin English, “I want to kill the man.” Oswald replied, “You’re not man\r\nenough, I can do it.” The Negro then said in Spanish, “I can’t go with\r\nyou, I have a lot to do.” Oswald replied, “The people are waiting for\r\nme back there.” The Negro then gave Oswald $6,500 in large-denomination\r\nAmerican bills, saying, “This isn’t much.” After hearing this\r\nconversation, “D” said that he telephoned the American Embassy in\r\nMexico City several times prior to the assassination in an attempt to\r\nreport his belief that someone important in the United States was to be\r\nkilled, but was finally told by someone at the Embassy to stop wasting\r\nhis time.\r\n\r\n“D” and his allegations were immediately subjected to intensive\r\ninvestigation. His former employment as an agent for a Latin American\r\ncountry was confirmed, although his superiors had no knowledge of his\r\npresence in Mexico or the assignment described by “D.” Four days after\r\n“D” first appeared the U.S. Government was informed by the Mexican\r\nauthorities that “D” had admitted in writing that his whole narrative\r\nabout Oswald was false. He said that he had never seen Oswald anyplace,\r\nand that he had not seen anybody paid money in the Cuban Embassy. He\r\nalso admitted that he never tried to telephone the American Embassy\r\nin September and that his first call to the Embassy was after the\r\nassassination. “D” said that his motive in fabricating the story was\r\nto help get himself admitted into the United States so that he could\r\nthere participate in action against Fidel Castro. He said that he hated\r\nCastro and hoped that the story he made up would be believed and would\r\ncause the United States to “take action” against him.\r\n\r\nStill later, when questioned by American authorities, “D” claimed that\r\nhe had been pressured into retracting his statement by the Mexican\r\npolice and that the retraction, rather than his first statement, was\r\nfalse. A portion of the American questioning was carried on with the\r\nuse of a polygraph machine, with the consent of “D.” When told that\r\nthe machine indicated that he was probably lying, “D” said words to\r\nthe effect that he “must be mistaken.” Investigation in the meantime\r\nhad disclosed that the Embassy extension number “D” said he had\r\ncalled would not have given him the person he said he spoke to, and\r\nthat no one at the Embassy--clerks, secretaries, or officers--had\r\nany recollection of his calls. In addition, Oswald spoke little, if\r\nany, Spanish. That he could have carried on the alleged conversation\r\nwith the red-headed Negro in the Cuban Embassy, part of which was\r\nsupposed to have been in Spanish, was therefore doubtful. “D” now said\r\nthat he was uncertain as to the date when he saw “someone who looked\r\nlike Oswald” at the Cuban Embassy, and upon reconsideration, he now\r\nthought it was on a Tuesday, September 17, rather than September 18. On\r\nSeptember 17, however, Oswald visited the Louisiana State Unemployment\r\nCommission in New Orleans and also cashed a check from the Texas\r\nEmployment Commission at the Winn-Dixie Store No. 1425 in New Orleans.\r\nOn the basis of the retractions made by “D” when he heard the results\r\nof the polygraph examination, and on the basis of discrepancies which\r\nappeared in his story, it was concluded that “D” was lying.[C6-578]\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the Commission has thus produced no evidence that\r\nOswald’s trip to Mexico was in any way connected with the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy, nor has it uncovered evidence that the Cuban\r\nGovernment had any involvement in the assassination. To the contrary,\r\nthe Commission has been advised by the CIA and FBI that secret and\r\nreliable sources corroborate the statements of Senora Duran in all\r\nmaterial respects, and that the Cuban Government had no relationship\r\nwith Lee Harvey Oswald other than that described by Senora Duran.\r\nSecretary of State Rusk also testified that after the assassination\r\n“there was very considerable concern in Cuba as to whether they would\r\nbe held responsible and what the effect of that might be on their own\r\nposition and their own safety.”[C6-579]\r\n\r\n_Contacts with the Soviet Embassy in the United States._--Soon after\r\nthe Oswalds reached the United States in June 1962 they wrote to the\r\nSoviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. Oswald requested information about\r\nsubscriptions to Russian newspapers and magazines and ultimately did\r\nsubscribe to several Russian journals. Soviet law required Marina\r\nOswald, as a Soviet citizen living abroad, to remain in contact with\r\nher nation’s Embassy and to file various papers occasionally.[C6-580]\r\nIn 1963, after Oswald had experienced repeated employment difficulties,\r\nthere were further letters when the Oswalds sought permission to return\r\nto the Soviet Union. The first such request was a letter written by\r\nMarina Oswald on February 17, 1963. She wrote that she wished to\r\nreturn to Russia but that her husband would stay in the United States\r\nbecause “he is an American by nationality.”[C6-581] She was informed\r\non March 8, 1963, that it would take from 5 to 6 months to process the\r\napplication.[C6-582] The Soviet Union made available to the Commission\r\nwhat purports to be the entire correspondence between the Oswalds\r\nand the Russian Embassy in the United States.[C6-583] This material\r\nhas been checked for codes and none has been detected.[C6-584] With\r\nthe possible exception of a letter which Oswald wrote to the Soviet\r\nEmbassy after his return from Mexico City, discussed below, there is\r\nno material which gives any reason for suspicion. The implications of\r\nall of this correspondence for an understanding of Lee Harvey Oswald’s\r\npersonality and motivation is discussed in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nOswald’s last letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C., dated\r\nNovember 9, 1963, began by stating that it was written “to inform you\r\nof recent events since my meetings with Comrade Kostin in the Embassy\r\nof the Soviet Union, Mexico City, Mexico.”[C6-585] The envelope bears\r\na postmark which appears to be November 12, 1963.[C6-586] Ruth Paine\r\nhas testified that Oswald spent the weekend at her home working on the\r\nletter and that she observed one preliminary draft.[C6-587] A piece\r\nof paper which was identified as one of these drafts was found among\r\nOswald’s effects after the assassination. (See Commission Exhibits\r\nNos. 15, 103, p. 311.) According to Marina Oswald, her husband retyped\r\nthe envelope 10 times.[C6-588]\r\n\r\nInformation produced for the Commission by the CIA is to the effect\r\nthat the person referred to in the letter as “comrade Kostin” was\r\nprobably Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov, a member of the consular staff\r\nof the Soviet Union in Mexico City. He is also one of the KGB officers\r\nstationed at the Embassy.[C6-589] It is standard Soviet procedure for\r\nKGB officers stationed in embassies and in consulates to carry on\r\nthe normal duties of such a position in addition to the undercover\r\nactivities.[C6-590] The Commission has identified the Cuban consul\r\nreferred to in Oswald’s letter as Senor Eusebio Azque (also “Ascue”),\r\nthe man with whom Oswald argued at the Cuban Embassy, who was in fact\r\nreplaced. The CIA advised the Commission:\r\n\r\n    We surmise that the references in Oswald’s 9 November letter to\r\n    a man who had since been replaced must refer to Cuban Consul\r\n    Eusebio Azque, who left Mexico for Cuba on permanent transfer\r\n    on 18 November 1963, four days before the assassination. Azque\r\n    had been in Mexico for 18 years and it was known as early as\r\n    September 1963 that Azque was to be replaced. His replacement\r\n    did arrive in September. Azque was scheduled to leave in\r\n    October but did not leave until 18 November.\r\n\r\n    We do not know who might have told Oswald that Azque or any\r\n    other Cuban had been or was to be replaced, but we speculate\r\n    that Silvia Duran or some Soviet official might have mentioned\r\n    it if Oswald complained about Azque’s altercation with\r\n    him.[C6-591]\r\n\r\nWhen asked to explain the letter, Marina Oswald was unable to add\r\nanything to an understanding of its contents.[C6-592] Some light\r\non its possible meaning can be shed by comparing it with the early\r\ndraft. When the differences between the draft and the final document\r\nare studied, and especially when crossed-out words are taken into\r\naccount, it becomes apparent that Oswald was intentionally beclouding\r\nthe true state of affairs in order to make his trip to Mexico sound as\r\nmysterious and important as possible.\r\n\r\nFor example, the first sentence in the second paragraph of the letter\r\nreads, “I was unable to remain in Mexico indefinily because of my\r\nmexican visa restrictions which was for 15 days only.” The same\r\nsentence in the draft begins, before the words are crossed out, “I was\r\nunable to remain in Mexico City because I considered useless * * *” As\r\nalready mentioned, the Commission has good evidence that Oswald’s trip\r\nto Mexico was indeed “useless” and that he returned to Texas with that\r\nconviction. The first draft, therefore, spoke the truth; but Oswald\r\nrewrote the sentence to imply that he had to leave because his visa was\r\nabout to expire. This is false; Oswald’s tourist card still had a full\r\nweek to run when he departed from Mexico on October 3.[C6-593]\r\n\r\nThe next sentence in the letter reads, “I could not take a chance on\r\nreqesting a new visa unless I used my real name, so I returned to the\r\nUnited States.” The fact is that he did use his real name for his\r\ntourist card, and in all dealings with the Cuban Embassy, the Russian\r\nEmbassy and elsewhere. Oswald did use the name of “Lee” on the trip,\r\nbut as indicated below, he did so only sporadically and probably as the\r\nresult of a clerical error. In the opinion of the Commission, based\r\nupon its knowledge of Oswald, the letter constitutes no more than a\r\nclumsy effort to ingratiate himself with the Soviet Embassy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT 15\r\n\r\nOSWALD’S LETTER TO THE EMBASSY U. S. S. R., WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\n(COMMISSION EXHIBIT 103)\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY DRAFT]\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestigation of Other Activities\r\n\r\n_Oswald’s use of post office boxes and false names._--After his return\r\nfrom the Soviet Union, Lee Harvey Oswald is known to have received\r\nhis mail at post office boxes and to have used different aliases on\r\nnumerous occasions. Since either practice is susceptible of use for\r\nclandestine purposes, the Commission has directed attention to both\r\nfor signs that Oswald at some point made undercover contact with other\r\npersons who might have been connected with the assassination.\r\n\r\nOswald is known to have opened three post office boxes during 1962 and\r\n1963. On October 9, 1962, the same day that he arrived in Dallas from\r\nFort Worth, and before establishing a residence there, he opened box\r\nNo. 2915 at the Dallas General Post Office. This box was closed on\r\nMay 14, 1963, shortly after Oswald had moved to New Orleans.[C6-594]\r\nThat portion of the post office box application listing the names of\r\nthose persons other than the applicant entitled to receive mail at\r\nthe box was discarded in accordance with postal regulations after the\r\nbox was closed; hence, it is not known what names other than Oswald’s\r\nwere listed on that form.[C6-595] However, as discussed in chapter IV,\r\nOswald is known to have received the assassination rifle under the\r\nname of A. Hidell and his Smith & Wesson revolver under the name of\r\nA. J. Hidell at that box.[C6-596] On June 3, 1963, Oswald opened box\r\nNo. 30061 at the Lafayette Square Substation in New Orleans. Marina\r\nOswald and A. J. Hidell were listed as additional persons entitled to\r\nreceive mail at this box.[C6-597] Immediately before leaving for Mexico\r\nCity in late September, Oswald submitted a request to forward his mail\r\nto the Paines’ address in Irving, and the box was closed on September\r\n26.[C6-598] On November 1, 1963, he opened box No. 6225 at the Dallas\r\nPost Office Terminal Annex. The Fair Play for Cuba Committee and the\r\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union were listed as also being entitled to\r\nreceive mail at this box.[C6-599]\r\n\r\nOswald’s use of post office boxes is consistent with other information\r\nknown about him. His frequent changes of address and receipt of\r\nCommunist and other political literature would appear to have provided\r\nOswald reason to have rented postal boxes. These were the explanations\r\nfor his use of the boxes which he provided Postal Inspector H. D.\r\nHolmes on November 24.[C6-600] Moreover, on October 14, 1963, he had\r\nmoved into a room on Beckley Avenue under the name of O. H. Lee[C6-601]\r\nand it would have been extremely difficult for Oswald to have received\r\nhis mail at that address without having disclosed his true name. The\r\nboxes cost Oswald only $1.50 or less per month.[C6-602]\r\n\r\nAlthough the possibilities of investigation in this area are limited,\r\nthere is no evidence that any of the three boxes was ever used for\r\nthe surreptitious receipt of messages or was used by persons other\r\nthan Oswald or his family. No unexplainable notes were found among\r\nOswald’s possessions after his arrest. Oswald’s box on the day of the\r\nassassination, No. 6225, was kept under constant personal surveillance\r\nby postal inspectors from about 5 p.m. November 22 until midnight\r\nNovember 24. A modified surveillance was maintained thereafter. No one\r\ncalled for mail out of this box; indeed the only mail in the box was a\r\nRussian magazine addressed to Oswald. The single outstanding key was\r\nrecovered from Oswald immediately after he was taken in custody.[C6-603]\r\n\r\nIn appraising the import of Oswald’s rental of post office boxes, it is\r\nsignificant that he was not secretive about their use. All three boxes\r\nwere rented by Oswald using his true name.[C6-604] His application\r\nfor box No. 2915 showed his home address as that of Alexandra De\r\nMohrenschildt (Taylor), whose husband had agreed to allow Oswald to use\r\nhis address.[C6-605] His application for the New Orleans box listed\r\nhis address as 657 French Street; his aunt, Lillian Murret, lived at\r\n757 French Street.[C6-606] On the application for box No. 6225, Oswald\r\ngave an incorrect street number, though he did show Beckley Avenue,\r\nwhere he was then living.[C6-607] He furnished the box numbers to\r\nhis brother, to an employer, to Texas and New Orleans unemployment\r\ncommissions, and to others.[C6-608] Based on all the facts disclosed\r\nby its investigation, the Commission has attached no conspiratorial\r\nsignificance to Oswald’s rental of post office boxes.\r\n\r\nOswald’s use of aliases is also well established. In chapter IV, the\r\nevidence relating to his repeated use of the name “A. J. Hidell,”\r\nand close variants thereof, is set forth.[C6-609] Because Oswald’s\r\nuse of this pseudonym became known quickly after the assassination,\r\ninvestigations were conducted with regard to persons using the name\r\nHidell or names similar to it. Subversive files, public carrier\r\nrecords, telegraph company records, banking and other commercial\r\nrecords, and other matters investigated and persons interviewed\r\nhave been examined with regard to Oswald’s true name and his known\r\nalias.[C6-610] No evidence has been produced that Oswald ever used the\r\nname Hidell as a means of making undercover contact with any person.\r\nIndeed, though Oswald did prepare a counterfeit selective service card\r\nand other identification using this name, he commonly used “Hidell”\r\nto represent persons other than himself, such as the president of his\r\nnonexistent Fair Play for Cuba Committee chapter, the doctor whose name\r\nappeared on his counterfeit international certificate of vaccination,\r\nand as references on his job applications.[C6-611]\r\n\r\nAlwyn Cole, questioned document expert for the Treasury Department,\r\ntestified that the false identification found on Oswald upon his arrest\r\ncould have been produced by employing elementary techniques used in\r\na photographic printing plant.[C6-612] (See app. X, pp. 571-578.)\r\nThough to perform the necessary procedures would have been difficult\r\nwithout the use of expensive photographic equipment, such equipment\r\nand the needed film and photographic paper were available to Oswald\r\nwhen he was employed from October 1962 through early April 1963 at\r\nJaggars-Chiles-Stovall, a commercial advertising photography firm in\r\nDallas.[C6-613] While so employed, Oswald is known to have become\r\nfamiliar with the mechanics of photographic enlargements, contraction,\r\nand image distortion that would have been necessary to produce his\r\nfalse identification, and to have used the facilities of his employer\r\nfor some personal work.[C6-614] Cole testified that the cards in\r\nOswald’s wallet did not exhibit a great deal of skill, pointing out\r\nvarious errors that had been committed.[C6-615] Oswald’s supervisor at\r\nJaggars-Chiles-Stovall has stated that Oswald seemed unable to perform\r\nphotographic work with precision, which was one of the main reasons for\r\nwhich he was ultimately discharged.[C6-616] The retouched negatives\r\nused to make Oswald’s counterfeit certificate of service identification\r\nwere found among Oswald’s personal effects after his arrest, as was\r\na rubber stamping kit apparently employed to produce his spurious\r\ninternational certificate of vaccination.[C6-617] There is strong\r\nevidence, therefore, that Oswald himself made the various pieces of\r\ncounterfeit identification which he carried, and there is no reason to\r\nbelieve that he received assistance from any person in establishing his\r\nalias.\r\n\r\nOswald also used incorrect names other than Hidell, but these too\r\nappear unconnected with any form of conspiracy. Oswald’s last name\r\nappears as “Lee” in three places in connection with his trip to Mexico\r\nCity, discussed above. His tourist card was typed by the Mexican\r\nconsulate in New Orleans, “Lee, Harvey Oswald.”[C6-618] However, the\r\ncomma seems to have been a clerical error, since Oswald signed both\r\nthe application and the card itself, “Lee H. Oswald.” Moreover, Oswald\r\nseems originally to have also printed his name, evenly spaced, as “Lee\r\nH Oswald,” but, noting that the form instructed him to “Print full\r\nname. No initials,” printed the remainder of his middle name after\r\nthe “H.” The clerk who typed the card thus saw a space after “Lee,”\r\nfollowed by “Harvey Oswald” crowded together, and probably assumed\r\nthat “Lee” was the applicant’s last name. (See Commission Exhibit\r\n2481, p. 300.) The clerk who prepared Oswald’s bus reservation for his\r\nreturn trip wrote “H. O. Lee.” He stated that he did not remember the\r\noccasion, although he was sure from the handwriting and from other\r\nfacts that he had dealt with Oswald. He surmised that he probably made\r\nout the reservation directly from the tourist card, since Oswald spoke\r\nno Spanish, and, seeing the comma, wrote the name “H. O. Lee.”[C6-619]\r\nOswald himself signed the register at the hotel in Mexico City as “Lee,\r\nHarvey Oswald,”[C6-620] but since the error is identical to that on the\r\ntourist card and since he revealed the remainder of his name, “Harvey\r\nOswald,” it is possible that Oswald inserted the comma to conform to\r\nthe tourist card, or that the earlier mistake suggested a new pseudonym\r\nto Oswald which he decided to continue.\r\n\r\nIn any event, Oswald used his correct name in making reservations for\r\nthe trip to Mexico City, in introducing himself to passengers on the\r\nbus, and in his dealings with the Cuban and Soviet Embassies.[C6-621]\r\nWhen registering at the Beckley Avenue house in mid-October, Oswald\r\nperpetuated the pseudonym by giving his name as “O. H. Lee,”[C6-622]\r\nthough he had given his correct name to the owner of the previous\r\nroominghouse where he had rented a room after his return from Mexico\r\nCity.[C6-623] Investigations of the Commission have been conducted\r\nwith regard to persons using the name “Lee,” and no evidence has been\r\nfound that Oswald used this alias for the purpose of making any type of\r\nsecret contacts.\r\n\r\nOswald is also known to have used the surname “Osborne” in ordering\r\nFair Play for Cuba Committee handbills in May 1963.[C6-624] He\r\nalso used the false name D. F. Drittal as a certifying witness on\r\nthe mail-order coupon with which he purchased his Smith & Wesson\r\nrevolver.[C6-625] He used the name Lt. J. Evans as a reference on an\r\nemployment application in New Orleans.[C6-626]\r\n\r\nOswald’s repeated use of false names is probably not to be\r\ndisassociated from his antisocial and criminal inclinations. No doubt\r\nhe purchased his weapons under the name of Hidell in attempt to prevent\r\ntheir ownership from being traced. Oswald’s creation of false names\r\nand ficititious personalities is treated in the discussion of possible\r\nmotives set forth in chapter VII. Whatever its significance in that\r\nrespect may be, the Commission has found no indication that Oswald’s\r\nuse of aliases was linked with any conspiracy with others.\r\n\r\n_Ownership of a second rifle._--The Commission has investigated a\r\nreport that, during the first 2 weeks of November 1963, Oswald had a\r\ntelescopic sight mounted and sighted on a rifle at a sporting goods\r\nstore in Irving, Tex. The main evidence that Oswald had such work\r\nperformed for him is an undated repair tag bearing the name “Oswald”\r\nfrom the Irving Sports Shop in Irving, Tex. On November 25, 1963, Dial\r\nD. Ryder, an employee of the Irving Sports Shop, presented this tag\r\nto agents of the FBI, claiming that the tag was in his handwriting.\r\nThe undated tag indicated that three holes had been drilled in an\r\nunspecified type of rifle and a telescopic sight had been mounted on\r\nthe rifle and boresighted.[C6-627]\r\n\r\nAs discussed in chapter IV, the telescopic sight on the C2766\r\nMannlicher-Carcano rifle was already mounted when shipped to Oswald,\r\nand both Ryder and his employer, Charles W. Greener, feel certain\r\nthat they never did any work on this rifle.[C6-628] If the repair\r\ntag actually represented a transaction involving Lee Harvey Oswald,\r\ntherefore, it would mean that Oswald owned another rifle. Although this\r\nwould not alter the evidence which establishes Oswald’s ownership of\r\nthe rifle used to assassinate President Kennedy, the possession of a\r\nsecond rifle warranted investigation because it would indicate that a\r\npossibly important part of Oswald’s life had not been uncovered.\r\n\r\nSince all of Oswald’s known transactions in connection with firearms\r\nafter his return to the United States were undertaken under an assumed\r\nname,[C6-629] it seems unlikely that if he did have repairs made at\r\nthe sports shop he would have used his real name. Investigation has\r\nrevealed that the authenticity of the repair tag bearing Oswald’s name\r\nis indeed subject to grave doubts. Ryder testified that he found the\r\nrepair tag while cleaning his workbench on November 23, 1963.[C6-630]\r\nHowever, Ryder spoke with Greener repeatedly during the period between\r\nNovember 22-28 and, sometime prior to November 25, he discussed\r\nwith him the possibility that Oswald had been in the store. Neither\r\nhe nor Greener could remember that he had been. But despite these\r\nconversations with Greener, it is significant that Ryder never called\r\nthe repair tag to his employer’s attention. Greener did not learn about\r\nthe tag until November 28, when he was called by TV reporters after the\r\nstory had appeared in the Dallas Times-Herald.[C6-631] The peculiarity\r\nof Ryder’s silence is compounded by the fact that, when speaking to\r\nthe FBI on November 25, Ryder fixed the period during which the tag\r\nhad been issued as November 1-14, 1963, yet, from his later testimony,\r\nit appears that he did so on the basis that it must have occurred\r\nwhen Greener was on vacation since Greener did not remember the\r\ntransaction.[C6-632] Moreover, the FBI had been directed to the Irving\r\nSports Shop by anonymous telephone calls received by its Dallas office\r\nand by a local television station. The anonymous male who telephoned\r\nthe Bureau attributed his information to an unidentified sack boy at a\r\nspecified supermarket in Irving, but investigation has failed to verify\r\nthis source.[C6-633]\r\n\r\nNeither Ryder nor Greener claimed that Lee Harvey Oswald had ever been\r\na customer in the Irving Sports Shop. Neither has any recollection of\r\neither Oswald or his Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, nor does either recall\r\nthe transaction allegedly represented by the repair tag or the person\r\nfor whom the repair was supposedly made.[C6-634] Although Ryder stated\r\nto the FBI that he was “quite sure” that he had seen Oswald and that\r\nOswald may have been in the store at one time, when shown a photograph\r\nof Oswald during his deposition, Ryder testified he knew the picture to\r\nbe of Oswald, “as the pictures in the paper, but as far as seeing the\r\nguy personally, I don’t think I ever have.”[C6-635]\r\n\r\nSubsequent events also reflect on Ryder’s credibility. In his\r\ndeposition, Ryder emphatically denied that he talked to any reporters\r\nabout this matter prior to the time a story about it appeared in the\r\nNovember 28, 1963, edition of the Dallas Times-Herald.[C6-636] Earlier,\r\nhowever, he told an agent of the U.S. Secret Service that the newspaper\r\nhad misquoted him.[C6-637] Moreover, a reporter for the Dallas\r\nTimes-Herald has testified that on November 28, 1963, he called Ryder\r\nat his home and obtained from him all of the details of the alleged\r\ntransaction, and his story is supported by the testimony of a second\r\nreporter who overheard one end of the telephone conversation.[C6-638]\r\nNo other person by the name of Oswald in the Dallas-Fort Worth area has\r\nbeen found who had a rifle repaired at the Irving Sports Shop.[C6-639]\r\n\r\nPossible corroboration for Ryder’s story is provided by two women,\r\nMrs. Edith Whitworth, who operates the Furniture Mart, a furniture\r\nstore located about 1½ blocks from the Irving Sports Shop, and Mrs.\r\nGertrude Hunter, a friend of Mrs. Whitworth. They testified that in\r\nearly November of 1963, a man who they later came to believe was\r\nOswald drove up to the Furniture Mart in a two-tone blue and white 1957\r\nFord automobile, entered the store and asked about a part for a gun,\r\npresumably because of a sign that appeared in the building advertising\r\na gunsmith shop that had formerly occupied part of the premises. When\r\nhe found that he could not obtain the part, the man allegedly returned\r\nto his car and then came back into the store with a woman and two young\r\nchildren to look at furniture, remaining in the store for about 30 to\r\n40 minutes.[C6-640]\r\n\r\nUpon confronting Marina Oswald, both women identified her as the woman\r\nwhom they had seen in the store on the occasion in question, although\r\nMrs. Hunter could not identify a picture of Lee Harvey Oswald and Mrs.\r\nWhitworth identified some pictures of Oswald but not others. Mrs.\r\nHunter purported to identify Marina Oswald by her eyes, and did not\r\nobserve the fact that Marina Oswald had a front tooth missing at the\r\ntime she supposedly saw her.[C6-641] After a thorough inspection of the\r\nFurniture Mart, Marina Oswald testified that she had never been on the\r\npremises before.[C6-642]\r\n\r\nThe circumstances surrounding the testimony of the two women are\r\nhelpful in evaluating the weight to be given to their testimony, and\r\nthe extent to which they lend support to Ryder’s evidence. The women\r\npreviously told newspaper reporters that the part for which the man\r\nwas looking was a “plunger,” which the Commission has been advised is\r\na colloquial term used to describe a firing pin.[C6-643] This work was\r\ncompletely different from the work covered by Ryder’s repair tag, and\r\nthe firing pin of the assassination weapon does not appear to have\r\nbeen recently replaced.[C6-644] At the time of their depositions,\r\nneither woman was able to recall the type of work which the man wanted\r\ndone.[C6-645]\r\n\r\nMrs. Whitworth related to the FBI that the man told her that the\r\nyounger child with him was born on October 20, 1963, which was in\r\nfact Rachel Oswald’s birthday.[C6-646] In her testimony before the\r\nCommission, however, Mrs. Whitworth could not state that the man had\r\ntold her the child’s birthdate was October 20, 1963, and in fact\r\nexpressed uncertainty about the birthday of her own grandchild, which\r\nshe had previously used as a guide to remembering the birthdate of the\r\nyounger child in the shop.[C6-647] Mrs. Hunter thought that the man she\r\nand Mrs. Whitworth believed was Oswald drove the car to and from the\r\nstore;[C6-648] however, Lee Harvey Oswald apparently was not able to\r\ndrive an automobile by himself and does not appear to have had access\r\nto a car.[C6-649]\r\n\r\nThe two women claimed that Oswald was in the Furniture Mart on a\r\nweekday, and in midafternoon. However, Oswald had reported to work\r\nat the Texas School Book Depository on the dates referred to by the\r\nwomen and there is no evidence that he left his job during business\r\nhours.[C6-650] In addition, Ruth Paine has stated that she always\r\naccompanied Marina Oswald whenever Marina left the house with her\r\nchildren and that they never went to the Furniture Mart, either with or\r\nwithout Lee Harvey Oswald, at any time during October or November of\r\n1963.[C6-651] There is nothing to indicate that in November the Oswalds\r\nwere interested in buying furniture.[C6-652]\r\n\r\nFinally, investigation has produced reason to question the credibility\r\nof Mrs. Hunter as a witness. Mrs. Hunter stated that one of the reasons\r\nshe remembers the description of the car in which Oswald supposedly\r\ndrove to the furniture store was that she was awaiting the arrival of a\r\nfriend from Houston, who drove a similar automobile.[C6-653] However,\r\nthe friend in Houston has advised that in November 1963, she never\r\nvisited or planned to visit Dallas, and that she told no one that she\r\nintended to make such a trip. Moreover the friend added, according to\r\nthe FBI interview report, that Mrs. Hunter has “a strange obsession\r\nfor attempting to inject herself into any big event which comes to her\r\nattention” and that she “is likely to claim some personal knowledge of\r\nany major crime which receives much publicity.”[C6-654] She concluded\r\nthat “the entire family is aware of these ‘tall tales’ Mrs. Hunter\r\ntells and they normally pay no attention to her.”[C6-655]\r\n\r\nAnother allegation relating to the possible ownership of a second\r\nrifle by Oswald comes from Robert Adrian Taylor, a mechanic at a\r\nservice station in Irving. Some 3 weeks after the assassination, Taylor\r\nreported to the FBI that he thought that, in March or April of 1963,\r\na man he believed to be Oswald had been a passenger in an automobile\r\nthat stopped at his station for repairs; since neither the driver nor\r\nthe passenger had sufficient funds for the repair work, the person\r\nbelieved to be Oswald sold a U.S. Army rifle to Mr. Taylor, using the\r\nproceeds to pay for the repairs.[C6-656] However, a second employee at\r\nthe service station, who recalled the incident, believed that, despite\r\na slight resemblance, the passenger was not Oswald.[C6-657] Upon\r\nreflection, Taylor himself stated that he is very doubtful that the man\r\nwas Oswald.[C6-658]\r\n\r\n_Rifle practice._--Several witnesses believed that in the weeks\r\npreceding the assassination, they observed a man resembling Oswald\r\npracticing with a rifle in the fields and wooded areas surrounding\r\nDallas, and at rifle ranges in that area. Some witnesses claimed Oswald\r\nwas alone, while others said he was accompanied by one or more other\r\npersons. In most instances, investigation has disclosed that there is\r\nno substantial basis for believing that the person reported by the\r\nvarious witnesses was Oswald.[C6-659]\r\n\r\nOne group of witnesses, however, believed that they observed Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald at the Sports Drome Rifle Range in Dallas at various\r\ntimes from September through November of 1963. In light of the number\r\nof witnesses, the similarity of the descriptions of the man they saw,\r\nand the type of weapon they thought the individual was shooting, there\r\nis reason to believe that these witnesses did see the same person at\r\nthe firing range, although the testimony of none of these witnesses is\r\nfully consistent with the reported observations of the other witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe witnesses who claimed to have seen Oswald at the firing range\r\nhad more than a passing notice of the person they observed. Malcolm\r\nH. Price, Jr., adjusted the scope on the individual’s rifle on one\r\noccasion;[C6-660] Garland G. Slack had an altercation with the\r\nindividual on another occasion because he was shooting at Slack’s\r\ntarget;[C6-661] and Sterling C. Wood, who on a third date was present\r\nat the range with his father, Dr. Homer Wood, spoke with his father and\r\nvery briefly with the man himself about the individual’s rifle.[C6-662]\r\nAll three of these persons, as well as Dr. Wood, expressed confidence\r\nthat the man they saw was Oswald.[C6-663] Two other persons believed\r\nthey saw a person resembling Oswald firing a similar rifle at another\r\nrange near Irving 2 days before the assassination.[C6-664]\r\n\r\nAlthough the testimony of these witnesses was partially corroborated\r\nby other witnesses,[C6-665] there was other evidence which prevented\r\nthe Commission from reaching the conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald\r\nwas the person these witnesses saw. Others who were at the firing\r\nrange remembered the same individual but, though noting a similarity\r\nto Oswald, did not believe that the man was Oswald;[C6-666] others\r\neither were unable to state whether the man was Oswald or did not\r\nrecall seeing anybody who they feel may have been Oswald.[C6-667]\r\nMoreover, when interviewed on December 2, 1963, Slack recalled that the\r\nindividual whom he saw had blond hair,[C6-668] and on December 3, 1963,\r\nPrice stated that on several occasions when he saw the individual,\r\nhe was wearing a “Bulldogger Texas style” hat and had bubble gum or\r\nchewing tobacco in his cheek.[C6-669] None of these characteristics\r\nmatch those known about Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the date on which Price adjusted the scope for the unknown\r\nperson was September 28, 1963, but Oswald is known to have been in\r\nMexico City at that time;[C6-670] since a comparison of the events\r\ntestified to by Price and Slack strongly suggests that they were\r\ndescribing the same man,[C6-671] there is reason to believe that\r\nSlack was also describing a man other than Oswald. In addition,\r\nSlack believed he saw the same person at the rifle range on November\r\n10[C6-672] and there is persuasive evidence that on November 10, Oswald\r\nwas at the Paine’s home in Irving and did not leave to go to the rifle\r\nrange.[C6-673] Finally, the man whom Price assisted on September 28\r\ndrove an old car, possibly a 1940 or 1941 Ford.[C6-674] However,\r\nthere is evidence that Oswald could not drive at that time, and there\r\nis no indication that Oswald ever had access to such a car.[C6-675]\r\nNeither Oswald’s name nor any of his known aliases was found in the\r\nsign-in register maintained at the Sports Drome Rifle Range, though\r\nmany customers did not sign this register.[C6-676] The allegations\r\npertaining to the companions who reportedly accompanied the man\r\nbelieved to be Oswald are also inconsistent among themselves[C6-677]\r\nand conform to no other credible information ascertained by the\r\nCommission. Several witnesses noticed a bearded man at the club when\r\nthe person believed to be Oswald was there, although only one witness\r\nthought the two men were together;[C6-678] the bearded gentleman\r\nwas located, and he was not found to have any connection with\r\nOswald.[C6-679]\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that the identification of Price, Slack, and the\r\nWoods was reinforced in their own minds by the belief that the man\r\nwhom they saw was firing a rifle perhaps identical to Oswald’s\r\nMannlicher-Carcano. The witnesses agreed that the man they observed\r\nwas firing a Mauser-type bolt-action rifle with the ammunition clip\r\nimmediately in front of the trigger action, and that a scope was\r\nmounted on the rifle.[C6-680] These features are consistent with the\r\nrifle Oswald used for the assassination.[C6-681] The witnesses agreed\r\nthat the man had accurate aim with the rifle.[C6-682]\r\n\r\nHowever, the evidence demonstrated that the weapon fired by the\r\nman they observed was different from the assassination rifle. The\r\nwitnesses agreed that the barrel of the gun which the individual\r\nwas firing had been shortened in the process of “sporterizing” the\r\nweapon.[C6-683] In addition, Price and Slack recalled that certain\r\npieces were missing from the top of the weapon,[C6-684] and Dr. Wood\r\nand his son, and others, remembered that the weapon spouted flames\r\nwhen fired.[C6-685] None of these characteristics correspond with\r\nOswald’s Mannlicher-Carcano.[C6-686] Price and Slack believed that the\r\ngun did not have a sling, but the assassination weapon did have one.\r\nSterling Wood, on the other hand, recalled that the rifle which he saw\r\nhad a sling.[C6-687] Price also recalled that he examined the rifle\r\nbriefly for some indication as to where it had been manufactured, but\r\nsaw nothing, whereas the words “MADE ITALY” are marked on the top of\r\nOswald’s Mannlicher-Carcano.[C6-688]\r\n\r\nThe scope on the rifle observed at the firing range does not appear to\r\nbe the same as the one on the assassination weapon. Price remembered\r\nthat the individual told him that his scope was Japanese, that he had\r\npaid $18 for it, and that he had it mounted in a gunshop in Cedar\r\nHills, though apparently no such shop exists in that area.[C6-689]\r\nThe scope on the Mannlicher-Carcano was of Japanese origin but it was\r\nworth a little more than $7 and was already mounted when he received\r\nthe rifle from a mail-order firm in Chicago.[C6-690] Sterling Wood and\r\nSlack agreed that the scope had a somewhat different appearance from\r\nthe scope on the assassination rifle.[C6-691]\r\n\r\nThough the person believed to be Oswald retained his shell casings,\r\npresumably for reuse,[C6-692] all casings recovered from areas where it\r\nis believed that Oswald may have practiced have been examined by the\r\nFBI Laboratory, and none has been found which was fired from Oswald’s\r\nrifle.[C6-693] Finally, evidence discussed in chapter IV tends to prove\r\nthat Oswald brought his rifle to Dallas from the home of the Paines in\r\nIrving on November 22, and there is no other evidence which indicates\r\nthat he took the rifle or a package which might have contained the\r\nrifle out of the Paine’s garage, where it was stored, prior to that\r\ndate.[C6-694]\r\n\r\n_Automobile demonstration._--The testimony of Albert Guy Bogard has\r\nbeen carefully evaluated because it suggests the possibility that\r\nOswald might have been a proficient automobile driver and, during\r\nNovember 1963, might have been expecting funds with which to purchase\r\na car. Bogard, formerly an automobile salesman with a Lincoln-Mercury\r\nfirm in Dallas, testified that in the early afternoon of November\r\n9, 1963, he attended a prospective customer who he believes was Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald. According to Bogard, the customer, after test driving\r\nan automobile over the Stemmons Freeway at 60 to 70 miles per hour,\r\ntold Bogard that in several weeks he would have the money to make a\r\npurchase. Bogard asserted that the customer gave his name as “Lee\r\nOswald,” which Bogard wrote on a business card. After Oswald’s name\r\nwas mentioned on the radio on November 22, Bogard assertedly threw the\r\ncard in a trash can, making the comment to coemployees that he supposed\r\nOswald would no longer wish to buy a car.[C6-695]\r\n\r\nBogard’s testimony has received corroboration.[C6-696] The assistant\r\nsales manager at the time, Frank Pizzo, and a second salesman, Eugene\r\nM. Wilson, stated that they recall an instance when the customer\r\ndescribed by Bogard was in the showroom.[C6-697] Another salesman,\r\nOran Brown, recalled that Bogard asked him to assist the customer if\r\nhe appeared during certain evenings when Bogard was away from the\r\nshowroom. Brown stated that he too wrote down the customer’s name and\r\nboth he and his wife remember the name “Oswald” as being on a paper in\r\nhis possession before the assassination.[C6-698]\r\n\r\nHowever, doubts exist about the accuracy of Bogard’s testimony. He,\r\nPizzo, and Wilson differed on important details of what is supposed to\r\nhave occurred when the customer was in the showroom. Whereas Bogard\r\nstated that the customer said he did not wish credit and wanted to\r\npurchase a car for cash,[C6-699] Pizzo and Wilson both indicated that\r\nthe man did attempt to purchase on credit.[C6-700] According to Wilson,\r\nwhen the customer was told that he would be unable to purchase a car\r\nwithout a credit rating, substantial cash or a lengthy employment\r\nrecord, he stated sarcastically, “Maybe I’m going to have to go back to\r\nRussia to buy a car.”[C6-701] While it is possible that Oswald would\r\nhave made such a remark, the statement is not consistent with Bogard’s\r\nstory. Indeed, Bogard has made no mention that the customer ever spoke\r\nwith Wilson while he was in the showroom.[C6-702] More important, on\r\nNovember 23, a search through the showroom’s refuse was made, but no\r\npaper bearing Oswald’s name was found.[C6-703] The paper on which Brown\r\nreportedly wrote Oswald’s name also has never been located.[C6-704]\r\n\r\nThe assistant sales manager, Mr. Pizzo, who saw Bogard’s prospect on\r\nNovember 9 and shortly after the assassination felt that Oswald may\r\nhave been this man, later examined pictures of Oswald and expressed\r\nserious doubts that the person with Bogard was in fact Oswald. While\r\nnoting a resemblance, he did not believe that Oswald’s hairline\r\nmatched that of the person who had been in the showroom on November\r\n9.[C6-705] Wilson has stated that Bogard’s customer was only about 5\r\nfeet tall.[C6-706] Several persons who knew Oswald have testified that\r\nhe was unable to drive,[C6-707] although Mrs. Paine, who was giving\r\nOswald driving lessons, stated that Oswald was showing some improvement\r\nby November.[C6-708] Moreover, Oswald’s whereabouts on November 9,\r\nas testified to by Marina Oswald and Ruth Paine, would have made it\r\nimpossible for him to have visited the automobile showroom as Mr.\r\nBogard claims.[C6-709]\r\n\r\n_Alleged association with various Mexican or Cuban individuals._--The\r\nCommission has examined Oswald’s known or alleged contacts and\r\nactivities in an effort to ascertain whether or not he was involved\r\nin any conspiracy may be seen in the investigation it conducted as\r\na result of the testimony given by Mrs. Sylvia Odio. The Commission\r\ninvestigated her statements in connection with its consideration of\r\nthe testimony of several witnesses suggesting that Oswald may have\r\nbeen seen in the company of unidentified persons of Cuban or Mexican\r\nbackground. Mrs. Odio was born in Havana in 1937 and remained in\r\nCuba until 1960; it appears that both of her parents are political\r\nprisoners of the Castro regime. Mrs. Odio is a member of the Cuban\r\nRevolutionary Junta (JURE), an anti-Castro organization.[C6-710] She\r\ntestified that late in September 1963, three men came to her apartment\r\nin Dallas and asked her to help them prepare a letter soliciting funds\r\nfor JURE activities. She claimed that the men, who exhibited personal\r\nfamiliarity with her imprisoned father, asked her if she were “working\r\nin the underground,” and she replied that she was not.[C6-711] She\r\ntestified that two of the men appeared to be Cubans, although they also\r\nhad some characteristics that she associated with Mexicans. Those two\r\nmen did not state their full names, but identified themselves only by\r\ntheir fictitious underground “war names.” Mrs. Odio remembered the name\r\nof one of the Cubans as “Leopoldo.”[C6-712] The third man, an American,\r\nallegedly was introduced to Mrs. Odio as “Leon Oswald,” and she was\r\ntold that he was very much interested in the Cuban cause.[C6-713]\r\nMrs. Odio said that the men told her that they had just come from New\r\nOrleans and that they were then about to leave on a trip.[C6-714] Mrs.\r\nOdio testified that the next day Leopoldo called her on the telephone\r\nand told her that it was his idea to introduce the American into the\r\nunderground “because he is great, he is kind of nuts.”[C6-715] Leopoldo\r\nalso said that the American had been in the Marine Corps and was an\r\nexcellent shot, and that the American said the Cubans “don’t have any\r\nguts * * * because President Kennedy should have been assassinated\r\nafter the Bay of Pigs, and some Cubans should have done that, because\r\nhe was the one that was holding the freedom of Cuba actually.”[C6-716]\r\n\r\nAlthough Mrs. Odio suggested doubts that the men were in fact members\r\nof JURE,[C6-717] she was certain that the American who was introduced\r\nto her as Leon Oswald was Lee Harvey Oswald.[C6-718] Her sister, who\r\nwas in the apartment at the time of the visit by the three men, and\r\nwho stated that she saw them briefly in the hallway when answering the\r\ndoor, also believed that the American was Lee Harvey Oswald.[C6-719]\r\nBy referring to the date on which she moved from her former apartment,\r\nOctober 1, 1963, Mrs. Odio fixed the date of the alleged visit on the\r\nThursday or Friday immediately preceding that date, i.e., September\r\n26 or 27. She was positive that the visit occurred prior to October\r\n1.[C6-720]\r\n\r\nDuring the course of its investigation, however, the Commission\r\nconcluded that Oswald could not have been in Dallas on the evening\r\nof either September 26 or 27, 1963. It also developed considerable\r\nevidence that he was not in Dallas at any time between the beginning\r\nof September and October 3, 1963. On April 24, Oswald left Dallas for\r\nNew Orleans, where he lived until his trip to Mexico City in late\r\nSeptember and his subsequent return to Dallas. Oswald is known to have\r\nbeen in New Orleans as late as September 23, 1963, the date on which\r\nMrs. Paine and Marina Oswald left New Orleans for Dallas.[C6-721]\r\nSometime between 4 p.m. on September 24 and 1 p.m. on September 25,\r\nOswald cashed an unemployment compensation check at a store in New\r\nOrleans;[C6-722] under normal procedures this check would not have\r\nreached Oswald’s postal box in New Orleans until at least 5 a.m. on\r\nSeptember 25.[C6-723] The store at which he cashed the check did not\r\nopen until 8 a.m.[C6-724] Therefore, it appeared that Oswald’s presence\r\nin New Orleans until sometime between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. on September 25\r\nwas quite firmly established.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no firm evidence of the means by which Oswald\r\ntraveled from New Orleans to Houston, on the first leg of his Mexico\r\nCity trip, the Commission noted that a Continental Trailways bus\r\nleaving New Orleans at 12:30 p.m. on September 25 would have brought\r\nOswald to Houston at 10:50 p.m. that evening.[C6-725] His presence\r\non this bus would be consistent with other evidence before the\r\nCommission.[C6-726] There is strong evidence that on September 26,\r\n1963, Oswald traveled on Continental Trailways bus No. 5133 which left\r\nHouston at 2:35 a.m. for Laredo, Tex. Bus company records disclose\r\nthat one ticket from Houston to Laredo was sold during the night\r\nshift on September 25-26, and that such ticket was the only one of\r\nits kind sold in the period of September 24 through September 26. The\r\nagent who sold this ticket has stated that Oswald could have been\r\nthe purchaser.[C6-727] Two English passengers, Dr. and Mrs. John B.\r\nMcFarland, testified that they saw Oswald riding alone on this bus\r\nshortly after they awoke at 6 a.m.[C6-728] The bus was scheduled to\r\narrive in Laredo at 1:20 p.m. on September 26, and Mexican immigration\r\nrecords show that Oswald in fact crossed the border at Laredo to Nuevo\r\nLaredo, Mexico, between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. on that day.[C6-729] Evidence\r\nset out in appendix XIII establishes that Oswald did not leave Mexico\r\nuntil October 3, and that he arrived in Dallas the same day.\r\n\r\nThe Commission noted that the only time not strictly accounted for\r\nduring the period that Mrs. Odio thought Oswald might have visited\r\nher is the span between the morning of September 25 and 2:35 a.m.\r\non September 26. The only public means of transportation by which\r\nOswald could have traveled from New Orleans to Dallas in time to\r\ncatch his bus from Houston to Laredo, would have been the airlines.\r\nInvestigation disclosed no indication that he flew between these\r\npoints.[C6-730] Moreover, it did not seem probable that Oswald would\r\nspeed from New Orleans, spend a short time talking to Sylvia Odio,\r\nand then travel from Dallas to Mexico City and back on the bus.\r\nAutomobile travel in the time available, though perhaps possible,\r\nwould have been difficult.[C6-731] The Commission noted, however,\r\nthat if Oswald had reached Dallas on the evening of September 25,\r\nhe could have traveled by bus to Alice, Tex., and there caught the\r\nbus which had left Houston for Laredo at 2:35 a.m. on September 26,\r\n1963.[C6-732] Further investigation in that regard indicated, however,\r\nthat no tickets were sold, during the period September 23-26, 1963 for\r\ntravel from Dallas to Laredo or points beyond by the Dallas office of\r\nContinental Trailways, the only bus line on which Oswald could have\r\nmade connections with the bus on which he was later seen. Furthermore,\r\nif Oswald had traveled from Dallas to Alice, he would not have reached\r\nthe Houston to Laredo bus until after he was first reportedly observed\r\non it by the McFarlands.[C6-733] Oswald had also told passengers on the\r\nbus to Laredo that he had traveled from New Orleans by bus, and made\r\nno mention of an intervening trip to Dallas.[C6-734] In addition, the\r\nCommission noted evidence that on the evening of September 25, 1963,\r\nOswald made a telephone call to a party in Houston proposing to visit a\r\nresident of Houston that evening[C6-735] and the fact that such a call\r\nwould appear to be inconsistent with Oswald’s having been in Dallas at\r\nthe time. It thus appeared that the evidence was persuasive that Oswald\r\nwas not in Dallas on September 25, and, therefore, that he was not in\r\nthat city at the time Mrs. Odio said she saw him.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that it appeared almost certain that Oswald\r\ncould not have been in Dallas at the time Mrs. Odio thought he was,\r\nthe Commission requested the FBI to conduct further investigation to\r\ndetermine the validity of Mrs. Odio’s testimony.[C6-736] The Commission\r\nconsidered the problems raised by that testimony as important in view\r\nof the possibility it raised that Oswald may have had companions on\r\nhis trip to Mexico.[C6-737] The Commission specifically requested the\r\nFBI to attempt to locate and identify the two men who Mrs. Odio stated\r\nwere with the man she thought was Oswald.[C6-738] In an effort to do\r\nthat the FBI located and interviewed Manuel Ray, a leader of JURE who\r\nconfirmed that Mrs. Odio’s parents were political prisoners in Cuba,\r\nbut stated that he did not know anything about the alleged Oswald\r\nvisit.[C6-739] The same was true of Rogelio Cisneros,[C6-740] a former\r\nanti-Castro leader from Miami who had visited Mrs. Odio in June of 1962\r\nin connection with certain anti-Castro activities.[C6-741] Additional\r\ninvestigation was conducted in Dallas and in other cities in search of\r\nthe visitors to Mrs. Odio’s apartment.[C6-742] Mrs. Odio herself was\r\nreinterviewed.[C6-743]\r\n\r\nOn September 16, 1964, the FBI located Loran Eugene Hall in\r\nJohnsandale, Calif.[C6-744] Hall has been identified as a participant\r\nin numerous anti-Castro activities.[C6-745] He told the FBI that in\r\nSeptember of 1963 he was in Dallas, soliciting aid in connection\r\nwith anti-Castro activities. He said he had visited Mrs. Odio. He\r\nwas accompanied by Lawrence Howard, a Mexican-American from East Los\r\nAngeles and one William Seymour from Arizona. He stated that Seymour\r\nis similar in appearance to Lee Harvey Oswald; he speaks only a few\r\nwords of Spanish,[C6-746] as Mrs. Odio had testified one of the men\r\nwho visited her did.[C6-747] While the FBI had not yet completed its\r\ninvestigation into this matter at the time the report went to press,\r\nthe Commission has concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was not at Mrs.\r\nOdio’s apartment in September of 1963.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has also noted the testimony of Evaristo Rodriguez,\r\na bartender in the Habana Bar in New Orleans, to the effect that\r\nhe saw Oswald in that bar in August of 1963 in the company of a\r\nLatin-appearing man.[C6-748] Rodriguez’ description of the man\r\naccompanying the person he thought to be Oswald was similar in respects\r\nto the description given by Sylvia Odio since both testified that the\r\nman may have been of either Cuban or Mexican extraction, and had a\r\nslight bald spot on the forepart of his hairline.[C6-749] Rodriguez’\r\nidentification of Oswald was uncorroborated except for the testimony\r\nof the owner of the bar, Orest Pena; according to Rodriguez, Pena was\r\nnot in a position to observe the man he thought later to have been\r\nOswald.[C6-750] Although Pena has testified that he did observe the\r\nsame person as did Rodriguez, and that this person was Oswald,[C6-751]\r\nan FBI interview report indicated that a month earlier Pena had\r\nstated that he “could not at this time or at any time say whether\r\nor not the person was identical with Lee Harvey Oswald.”[C6-752]\r\nThough when testifying, Pena identified photographs of Oswald, the\r\nFBI report also recorded that Pena “stated the only reason he was\r\nable to recognize Oswald was because he had seen Oswald’s picture in\r\nthe news media so often after the assassination of President John F.\r\nKennedy.”[C6-753] When present at Pena’s bar, Oswald was supposed to\r\nhave been intoxicated to the extent that he became ill,[C6-754] which\r\nis inconsistent with other evidence that Oswald did not drink alcoholic\r\nbeverages to excess.[C6-755]\r\n\r\nThe Commission has also noted the testimony of Dean Andrews, an\r\nattorney in New Orleans. Andrews stated that Oswald came to his office\r\nseveral times in the summer of 1963 to seek advice on a less than\r\nhonorable discharge from the Armed Forces, the citizenship status of\r\nhis wife and his own citizenship status. Andrews, who believed that he\r\nwas contacted on November 23 to represent Oswald, testified that Oswald\r\nwas always accompanied by a Mexican and was at times accompanied by\r\napparent homosexuals.[C6-756] Andrews was able to locate no records of\r\nany of Oswald’s alleged visits, and investigation has failed to locate\r\nthe person who supposedly called Andrews on November 23, at a time\r\nwhen Andrews was under heavy sedation.[C6-757] While one of Andrews’\r\nemployees felt that Oswald might have been at his office, his secretary\r\nhas no recollection of Oswald being there.[C6-758]\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald Was Not an Agent for the U.S. Government\r\n\r\nFrom the time of his release from the Marine Corps until the\r\nassassination, Lee Harvey Oswald dealt in various transactions with\r\nseveral agencies of the U.S. Government. Before departing the United\r\nStates for the Soviet Union in 1959, he obtained an American passport,\r\nwhich he returned to the Embassy in Moscow in October 1959 when he\r\nattempted to renounce his U.S. citizenship. Thereafter, while in the\r\nSoviet Union, Oswald had numerous contacts with the American Embassy,\r\nboth in person and through correspondence. Two years later, he applied\r\nfor the return and renewal of his passport, which was granted him.\r\nHis application concerning the admittance of his wife to this country\r\nwas passed upon by the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the\r\nDepartment of Justice in addition to the State Department. And before\r\nreturning to this country, he secured a loan from the State Department\r\nto help cover his transportation costs from Moscow to New York.\r\nThese dealings with the Department of State and the Immigration and\r\nNaturalization Service have been reviewed earlier in this chapter and\r\nare considered in detail in appendix XV. After his return, Oswald was\r\ninterviewed on three occasions by agents of the FBI, and Mrs. Paine was\r\nalso questioned by the FBI about Oswald’s activities. Oswald obtained a\r\nsecond passport in June of 1963. And both the FBI and the CIA took note\r\nof his Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities in New Orleans and his\r\nappearance at the Soviet consulate in Mexico City. For reasons which\r\nwill be discussed fully in chapter VIII, Oswald’s name was never given\r\nto the U.S. Secret Service.\r\n\r\nThese dealings have given rise to numerous rumors and allegations\r\nthat Oswald may have been a paid informant or some type of undercover\r\nagent for a Federal agency, usually the FBI or the CIA. The Commission\r\nhas fully explored whether Oswald had any official or unofficial\r\nrelationship with any Federal agency beyond that already described.\r\n\r\nOswald’s mother, Mrs. Marguerite Oswald, testified before the\r\nCommission that she believes her son went to Russia and returned as\r\nan undercover agent for the U.S. Government.[C6-759] Mrs. Oswald\r\nmentioned the belief that her son was an agent to a State Department\r\nrepresentative whom she visited in January 1961, when she was trying\r\nto locate her son.[C6-760] She had been interviewed earlier by FBI\r\nAgent John W. Fain, within some 6 months of Oswald’s departure for\r\nRussia, and did not at that time suggest such an explanation for\r\nOswald’s departure.[C6-761] Though provided the opportunity to present\r\nany material she considered pertinent, Mrs. Oswald was not able to\r\ngive the Commission any reasonable basis for her speculation.[C6-762]\r\nAs discussed later in this chapter, the Commission has investigated\r\nMarguerite Oswald’s claim that an FBI agent showed her a picture of\r\nJack Ruby after the assassination but before Lee Harvey Oswald had been\r\nkilled; this allegation was inaccurate, since the picture was not of\r\nRuby.\r\n\r\nAfter the assassination it was reported that in 1962 Oswald had told\r\nPauline Bates, a public stenographer in Fort Worth, Tex., that he\r\nhad become a “secret agent” of the U.S. Government and that he was\r\nsoon going back to Russia “for Washington.”[C6-763] Mrs. Bates in her\r\nsworn testimony denied that Oswald ever told her anything to that\r\neffect.[C6-764] She testified that she had stated “that when he first\r\nsaid that he went to Russia and had gotten a visa that I thought--it\r\nwas just a thought--that maybe he was going over under the auspices of\r\nthe State Department--as a student or something.”[C6-765]\r\n\r\nIn order to evaluate the nature of Oswald’s dealings with the\r\nDepartment of State and the Immigration and Naturalization Service,\r\nthe Commission has obtained the complete files of both the Department\r\nand the Service pertaining to Lee Harvey Oswald. Officials who were\r\ndirectly involved in dealing with the Oswald case on these matters have\r\ntestified before the Commission. A critical evaluation of the manner in\r\nwhich they were handled by these organizations is set forth in appendix\r\nXV. The record establishes that Oswald received no preferential\r\ntreatment and that his case involved no impropriety on the part of any\r\nGovernment official.\r\n\r\nDirector John A. McCone and Deputy Director Richard Helms of the\r\nCentral Intelligence Agency testified before the Commission that no\r\none connected with the CIA had ever interviewed Oswald or communicated\r\nwith him in any way.[C6-766] In his supplementing affidavit, Director\r\nMcCone stated unequivocally that Oswald was not an agent, employee, or\r\ninformant of the CIA, that the Agency never communicated with him in\r\nany manner or furnished him any compensation, and that Oswald was never\r\ndirectly or indirectly associated with the CIA.[C6-767] The Commission\r\nhas had access to the full CIA file on Oswald which is entirely\r\nconsistent with Director McCone’s statements.\r\n\r\nThe Director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, Assistant to the Director\r\nAlan H. Belmont, FBI Agents John W. Fain and John L. Quigley, who\r\ninterviewed Oswald, and FBI Agent James P. Hosty, Jr., who was in\r\ncharge of his case at the time of the assassination, have also\r\ntestified before the Commission. All declared, in substance, that\r\nOswald was not an informant or agent of the FBI, that he did not act\r\nin any other capacity for the FBI, and that no attempt was made to\r\nrecruit him in any capacity.[C6-768] Director Hoover and each Bureau\r\nagent, who according to the FBI would have been responsible for or\r\naware of any attempt to recruit Oswald as an informant, have also\r\nprovided the Commission with sworn affidavits to this effect.[C6-769]\r\nDirector Hoover has sworn that he caused a search to be made of the\r\nrecords of the Bureau, and that the search discloses that Oswald “was\r\nnever an informant of the FBI, and never assigned a symbol number in\r\nthat capacity, and was never paid any amount of money by the FBI in any\r\nregard.”[C6-770] This testimony is corroborated by the Commission’s\r\nindependent review of the Bureau files dealing with the Oswald\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nThe Commission also investigated the circumstances which led to the\r\npresence in Oswald’s address book of the name of Agent Hosty together\r\nwith his office address, telephone number, and license number.[C6-771]\r\nHosty and Mrs. Paine testified that on November 1, 1963, Hosty left his\r\nname and phone number with Mrs. Paine so that she could advise Hosty\r\nwhen she learned where Oswald was living in Dallas.[C6-772] Mrs. Paine\r\nand Marina Oswald have testified that Mrs. Paine handed Oswald the\r\nslip of paper on which Hosty had written this information.[C6-773] In\r\naccordance with prior instructions from Oswald,[C6-774] Marina Oswald\r\nnoted Hosty’s license number which she gave to her husband.[C6-775] The\r\naddress of the Dallas office of the FBI could have been obtained from\r\nmany public sources.\r\n\r\nThus, close scrutiny of the records of the Federal agencies involved\r\nand the testimony of the responsible officials of the U.S. Government\r\nestablish that there was absolutely no type of informant or undercover\r\nrelationship between an agency of the U.S. Government and Lee Harvey\r\nOswald at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald’s Finances\r\n\r\nIn search of activities or payments demonstrating the receipt of\r\nunexplained funds, the Commission undertook a detailed study of\r\nOswald’s receipts and expenditures starting with the date of his return\r\nfrom the Soviet Union on June 13, 1962, and continuing to the date of\r\nhis arrest on November 22, 1963. In appendix XIV there appears a table\r\nlisting Oswald’s estimated receipts and expenditures on a monthly basis\r\nduring this period.\r\n\r\nThe Commission was assisted in this phase of the investigation by able\r\ninvestigators of the Internal Revenue Service of the Department of\r\nthe Treasury and by agents of the FBI. The investigation extended far\r\nbeyond interrogation of witnesses who appeared before the Commission.\r\nAt banks in New Orleans, La.; Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston, and Laredo,\r\nTex., inquiries were made for any record of a checking, savings, or\r\nloan accounts or a safe deposit box rented in the names of Lee Harvey\r\nOswald, his known aliases, or members of his immediate family. In many\r\ncases a photograph of Oswald was exhibited to bank officials who were\r\nin a position to see a person in the safe deposit box area of their\r\nbanks. No bank account or safe deposit boxes were located which could\r\nbe identified with Oswald during this period of his life, although\r\nevidence was developed of a bank account which he had used prior to\r\nhis trip to the Soviet Union in 1959. Telegraph companies were checked\r\nfor the possibility of money orders that may have been sent to Oswald.\r\nAll known locations where Oswald cashed checks which he received\r\nwere queried as to the possibility of his having cashed other checks\r\nthere. Further inquiries were made at Oswald’s places of employment,\r\nhis residences and with local credit associations, hospitals,\r\nutility companies, State and local government offices, post offices,\r\nperiodicals, newspapers, and employment agencies.[C6-776]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald testified that she knew of no sources of income Oswald\r\nother than his wages and his unemployment compensation.[C6-777] No\r\nevidence of other cash income has been discovered. The Commission has\r\nfound that the funds known to have been available to Oswald during\r\nthe period June 13, 1962, through November 22, 1963, were sufficient\r\nto cover all of his known expenditures during this period. Including\r\ncash on hand of $63 when he arrived from the Soviet Union, the Oswalds\r\nreceived a total of $3,665.89 in cash from wages, unemployment\r\ncompensation benefits, loans, and gifts from acquaintances. His cash\r\ndisbursements during this period were estimated at $3,501.79, leaving\r\na balance of $164.10. (See app. XIV.) This estimated balance is within\r\n$19 of the $183.87 in cash which was actually in Oswald’s possession\r\nat the time of his arrest, consisting of $13.87 on his person and $170\r\nin his wallet left at the Paine house.[C6-778]\r\n\r\nIn computing Oswald’s expenditures, estimates were made for food,\r\nclothing, and incidental expenses. The incidental expenses included\r\ntelephone calls, the cost of local newspapers, money order and\r\ncheck-cashing fees, postage, local transportation costs, personal care\r\ngoods and services, and other such small items. All of these expenses,\r\nincluding food and clothing, were estimated at a slightly higher figure\r\nthan would be normal for a family with the income of the Oswalds, and\r\nprobably higher than the Oswalds actually spent on such items.[C6-779]\r\nThis was done in order to be certain that even if some of Oswald’s\r\nminor expenditures are not known, he had adequate funds to cover his\r\nknown expenditures.\r\n\r\nDuring the 17-month period preceding his death, Oswald’s pattern of\r\nliving was consistent with his limited income. He lived with his family\r\nin furnished apartments whose cost, including utilities, ranged from\r\nabout $60 to $75 per month.[C6-780] Witnesses testified to his wife’s\r\ndisappointment and complaints and to their own shock and misgivings\r\nabout several of the apartments in which the Oswalds lived during\r\nthe period.[C6-781] Moreover, the Oswalds, particularly Marina,\r\nfrequently lived with relatives and acquaintances at no cost. Oswald\r\nand his family lived with his brother Robert and then with Marguerite\r\nOswald from June until sometime in August 1962.[C6-782] As discussed\r\npreviously, Marina Oswald lived with Elena Hall and spent a few nights\r\nat the Taylors’ house during October of 1962;[C6-783] in November\r\nof that same year, Marina Oswald lived with two families.[C6-784]\r\nWhen living away from his family Oswald rented rooms for $7 and $8\r\nper week or stayed at the YMCA in Dallas where he paid $2.25 per\r\nday.[C6-785] During late April and early May 1963, Oswald lived with\r\nrelatives in New Orleans, while his wife lived with Ruth Paine in\r\nIrving, Tex.[C6-786] From September 24, 1963, until November 22, Marina\r\nOswald stayed with Ruth Paine, while Oswald lived in roominghouses\r\nin Dallas.[C6-787] During the period Marina Oswald resided with\r\nothers, neither she nor her husband made any contribution to her\r\nsupport.[C6-788]\r\n\r\nThe Oswalds owned no major household appliances, had no automobile,\r\nand resorted to dental and hospital clinics for medical care.[C6-789]\r\nAcquaintances purchased baby furniture for them, and paid dental\r\nbills in one instance.[C6-790] After his return to the United States,\r\nOswald did not smoke or drink, and he discouraged his wife from\r\ndoing so.[C6-791] Oswald spent much of his time reading books which\r\nhe obtained from the public library, and periodicals to which he\r\nsubscribed.[C6-792] He resided near his place of employment and used\r\nbuses to travel to and from work.[C6-793] When he visited his wife\r\nand the children on weekends in October and November 1963, he rode\r\nin a neighbor’s car, making no contribution for gasoline or other\r\nexpenses.[C6-794] Oswald’s personal wardrobe was also very modest.\r\nHe customarily wore T-shirts, cheap slacks, well-worn sweaters, and\r\nwell-used zipper jackets. Oswald owned one suit, of Russian make\r\nand purchase, poor fitting and of heavy fabric which, despite its\r\nunsuitability to the climates of Texas and Louisiana and his obvious\r\ndiscomfort, he wore on the few occasions that required dress.[C6-795]\r\n\r\nFood for his family was extremely meager. Paul Gregory testified\r\nthat during the 6 weeks that Marina Oswald tutored him he took the\r\nOswalds shopping for food and groceries on a number of occasions\r\nand that he was “amazed at how little they bought.”[C6-796] Their\r\nfriends in the Dallas-Fort Worth area frequently brought them food and\r\ngroceries.[C6-797] Marina testified that her husband ate “very little.”\r\nHe “never had breakfast. He just drank coffee and that is all. Not\r\nbecause he was trying to economize. Simply he never liked to eat.” She\r\nestimated that when he was living by himself in a roominghouse, he\r\nwould spend “about a dollar, $1.30” for dinner and have a sandwich and\r\nsoft drink for lunch.[C6-798]\r\n\r\nThe thrift which Oswald exercised in meeting his living expenses\r\nallowed him to accumulate sufficient funds to meet other expenses which\r\nhe incurred after his return from the Soviet Union. From his return\r\nuntil January of 1963, Oswald repaid the $435.71 he had borrowed from\r\nthe State Department for travel expenses from Moscow, and the $200\r\nloan he had obtained from his brother Robert to fly from New York to\r\nDallas upon his return to this country. He completed the retirement\r\nof the debt to his brother in October 1962.[C6-799] His cash receipts\r\nfrom all sources from the day of his arrival in Fort Worth through\r\nOctober 1962 aggregated $719.94; it is estimated that he could have\r\nmade the repayments to Robert and met his other known expenses and\r\nstill have been left with savings of $122.06 at the end of the month.\r\nAfter making initial $10 monthly payments to the State Department,\r\nOswald paid the Government $190 in December and $206 in January, thus\r\nliquidating that debt.[C6-800] From his net earning of $805.96 from\r\nNovember through January plus his prior savings, Oswald could have made\r\nthese payments to the State Department, met his other known expenses,\r\nand still have had a balance of $8.59 at the end of January 1963. In\r\ndiscussing the repayment of these debts, Marina Oswald testified: “Of\r\ncourse we did not live in luxury. We did not buy anything that was not\r\nabsolutely needed, because Lee had to pay his debt to Robert and to the\r\nGovernment. But it was not particularly difficult.”[C6-801]\r\n\r\nIncluded in the total figure for Oswald’s disbursements were $21.45\r\nfor the rifle used in the assassination and $31.22 for the revolver\r\nwith which Oswald shot Officer Tippit. The major portion of the\r\npurchase price for these weapons was paid in March 1963, when Oswald\r\nhad finished paying his debts, and the purchases were compatible with\r\nthe total funds then available to him.[C6-802] During May, June, and\r\nJuly of 1963, Oswald spent approximately $23 for circulars, application\r\nblanks, and membership cards for his one-man New Orleans chapter of\r\nthe Fair Play for Cuba Committee.[C6-803] In August he paid $2 to\r\none and possibly two young men to assist in passing out circulars\r\nand then paid a $10 court fine after pleading guilty to a charge of\r\ndisturbing the peace.[C6-804] Although some of these expenses were\r\nincurred after Oswald lost his job on July 19, 1963, his wages during\r\nJune and July, and his unemployment compensation thereafter, provided\r\nsufficient funds to enable him to finance these activities out of his\r\nown resources.[C6-805]\r\n\r\nAlthough Oswald paid his own busfare to New Orleans on April 24, 1963,\r\nhis wife and the baby were taken there, at no cost to Oswald, by Ruth\r\nPaine.[C6-806] Similarly, Ruth Paine drove to New Orleans in September\r\nand brought Marina Oswald and the baby back to Irving, Tex.[C6-807]\r\nOswald’s uncle, Charles Murret, also paid for the short trip taken by\r\nOswald and his family from New Orleans to Mobile, Ala., on July 27,\r\n1963.[C6-808] It is estimated that when Oswald left for Mexico City in\r\nSeptember 1963, he had accumulated slightly over $200. Marina Oswald\r\ntestified that when he left for Mexico City he had “a little over\r\n$100,” though she may not have taken into account the $33 unemployment\r\ncompensation check which Oswald collected after her departure from New\r\nOrleans.[C6-809] In any event, expenses in Mexico have been estimated\r\nas approximately $85, based on transportation costs of $50 and a hotel\r\nexpense of about $1.28 per day. Oswald ate inexpensively and, allowing\r\n$15 for entertainment and miscellaneous items, it would appear that he\r\nhad the funds available to finance the trip.[C6-810]\r\n\r\nThe Commission has considered the testimony of Leonard E. Hutchison,\r\nproprietor of Hutch’s Market in Irving, in connection with Oswald’s\r\nfinances. Hutchison has testified that on a Friday during the first\r\nweek in November, a man he believes to have been Lee Harvey Oswald\r\nattempted to cash a “two-party,” or personal check for $189, but that\r\nhe refused to cash the check since his policy is to cash personal\r\nchecks for no more than $25.[C6-811] Oswald is not known to have\r\nreceived a check for this amount from any source.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, November 1, Oswald did cash a Texas Unemployment Commission\r\ncheck for $33 at another supermarket in Irving,[C6-812] so that a\r\npossible explanation of Hutchison’s testimony is that he refused to\r\ncash this $33 check for Oswald and is simply in error as to the amount\r\nof the instrument. However, since the check cashed at the supermarket\r\nwas issued by the State comptroller of Texas, it is not likely that\r\nHutchison could have confused it with a personal check.\r\n\r\nExamination of Hutchison’s testimony indicates that a more likely\r\nexplanation is that Oswald was not in his store at all. Hutchison\r\ntestified that the man who attempted to cash the check was a customer\r\nin his store on previous occasions; in particular, Hutchison recalled\r\nthat the man, accompanied by a woman he believes was Marina Oswald and\r\nan elderly woman, were shopping in his store in October or November\r\nof 1963 on a night he feels certain was a Wednesday evening.[C6-813]\r\nOswald, however, is not known to have been in Irving on any Wednesday\r\nevening during this period.[C6-814] Neither of the two checkers at\r\nthe market recall such a visit by a person matching the description\r\nprovided by Hutchison, and both Marina Oswald and Marguerite Oswald\r\ndeny that they were ever in Hutchison’s store.[C6-815] Hutchison\r\nfurther stated that the man made irregular calls at his grocery between\r\n7:20 a.m. and 7:45 a.m. on weekday mornings, and always purchased\r\ncinnamon rolls and a full gallon of milk.[C6-816] However, the evidence\r\nindicates that except for rare occasions Oswald was in Irving only on\r\nweekends; moreover, Buell Wesley Frazier, who drove Oswald to and from\r\nIrving on these occasions, testified that on Monday mornings he picked\r\nOswald up at a point which is many blocks from Hutchison’s store and\r\nordinarily by 7:20 a.m.[C6-817] Hutchison also testified that Ruth\r\nPaine was an occasional customer in his store;[C6-818] however, Mrs.\r\nPaine indicated that she was not in the store as often as Hutchison\r\ntestified;[C6-819] and her appearance is dissimilar to the description\r\nof the woman Hutchison stated was Mrs. Paine.[C6-820] In light of the\r\nstrong reasons for doubting the correctness of Hutchison’s testimony\r\nand the absence of any other sign that Oswald ever possessed a personal\r\ncheck for $189, the Commission was unable to conclude that he ever\r\nreceived such a check.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has also examined a report that, not long before the\r\nassassination, Oswald may have received unaccounted funds through money\r\norders sent to him in Dallas. Five days after the assassination, C.A.\r\nHamblen, early night manager for the Western Union Telegraph Co. in\r\nDallas, told his superior that about 2 weeks earlier he remembered\r\nOswald sending a telegram from the office to Washington, D.C., possibly\r\nto the Secretary of the Navy, and that the application was completed\r\nin an unusual form of hand printing.[C6-821] The next day Hamblen\r\ntold a magazine correspondent who was in the Western Union office on\r\nother business that he remembered seeing Oswald in the office on prior\r\noccasions collecting money orders for small amounts of money.[C6-822]\r\nSoon thereafter Hamblen signed a statement relating to both the\r\ntelegram and the money orders, and specifying two instances in which\r\nhe had seen the person he believed to be Oswald in the office; in each\r\ninstance the man had behaved disagreeably and one other Western Union\r\nemployee had become involved in assisting him.[C6-823]\r\n\r\nDuring his testimony, Hamblen did not recall with clarity the\r\nstatements he had previously made, and was unable to state whether\r\nthe person he reportedly had seen in the Western Union office was or\r\nwas not Lee Harvey Oswald.[C6-824] Investigation has disclosed that\r\na second employee does recall one of the occurrences described by\r\nHamblen, and believes that the money order in question was delivered\r\n“to someone at the YMCA”; however, he is unable to state whether or\r\nnot the man involved was Oswald.[C6-825] The employee referred to by\r\nHamblen in connection with the second incident feels certain that the\r\nunusual episode described by Hamblen did not occur, and that she at no\r\ntime observed Oswald in the Western Union office.[C6-826]\r\n\r\nAt the request of Federal investigators, officers of Western Union\r\nconducted a complete search of their records in Dallas and in other\r\ncities, for the period from June through November 1963, for money\r\norders payable to Lee Harvey Oswald or his known aliases and for\r\ntelegrams sent by Oswald or his known aliases. In addition, all money\r\norders addressed to persons at the YMCA in Dallas during October\r\nand November 1963 were inspected, and all telegrams handled from\r\nNovember 1 through November 22 by the employee who Hamblen assertedly\r\nsaw service Oswald were examined, as were all telegrams sent from\r\nDallas to Washington during November. No indication of any such money\r\norder or telegram was found in any of these records.[C6-827] Hamblen\r\nhimself participated in this search, and was “unable * * * to pin down\r\nany of these telegrams or money orders that would indicate it was\r\nOswald.”[C6-828] Hamblen’s superiors have concluded “that this whole\r\nthing was a figment of Mr. Hamblen’s imagination,”[C6-829] and the\r\nCommission accepts this assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE CONSPIRACY INVOLVING JACK RUBY\r\n\r\nJack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald at 11:21 a.m., on Sunday, November\r\n24, 1963, shortly after Ruby entered the basement of the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment. Almost immediately, speculation arose that Ruby had acted\r\non behalf of members of a conspiracy who had planned the killing of\r\nPresident Kennedy and wanted to silence Oswald. This section of chapter\r\nVI sets forth the Commission’s investigation into the possibility\r\nthat Ruby, together with Oswald or with others, conspired to kill the\r\nPresident, or that Ruby, though not part of any such conspiracy, had\r\naccomplices in the slaying of Oswald. Presented first are the results\r\nof the Commission’s detailed inquiry into Ruby’s actions from November\r\n21 to November 24. In addition, this section analyzes the numerous\r\nrumors and suspicions that Ruby and Oswald were acquainted and examines\r\nRuby’s background and associations for evidence of any conspiratorial\r\nrelationship or motive. A detailed life of Ruby is given in appendix\r\nXVI which provides supplemental information about Ruby and his\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\n\r\nRuby’s Activities From November 21 to November 24, 1963\r\n\r\nThe Commission has attempted to reconstruct as precisely as possible\r\nthe movements of Jack Ruby during the period November 21-November 24,\r\n1963. It has done so on the premise that, if Jack Ruby were involved\r\nin a conspiracy, his activities and associations during this period\r\nwould, in some way, have reflected the conspiratorial relationship.\r\nThe Commission has not attempted to determine the time at which Ruby\r\nfirst decided to make his attack on Lee Harvey Oswald, nor does it\r\npurport to evaluate the psychiatric and related legal questions which\r\nhave arisen from the assault upon Oswald. Ruby’s activities during\r\nthis 3-day period have been scrutinized, however, for the insight they\r\nprovide into whether the shooting of Oswald was grounded in any form of\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\n_The eve of the President’s visit._--On Thursday, November 21, Jack\r\nRuby was attending to his usual duties as the proprietor of two\r\nDallas night spots--the Carousel Club, a downtown nightclub featuring\r\nstriptease dancers, and the Vegas Club, a rock-and-roll establishment\r\nin the Oaklawn section of Dallas. Both clubs opened for business each\r\nday in the early evening and continued 7 days a week until after\r\nmidnight.[C6-830] Ruby arrived at the Carousel Club at about 3 p.m.\r\nThursday afternoon, as was his custom,[C6-831] and remained long\r\nenough to chat with a friend and receive messages from Larry Crafard,\r\na handyman and helper who lived at the Carousel.[C6-832] Earlier in\r\nthe day Ruby had visited with a young lady who was job hunting in\r\nDallas,[C6-833] paid his rent for the Carousel premises,[C6-834]\r\nconferred about a peace bond he had been obliged to post as a result\r\nof a fight with one of his striptease dancers,[C6-835] consulted\r\nwith an attorney about problems he was having with Federal tax\r\nauthorities,[C6-836] distributed membership cards for the Carousel\r\nClub,[C6-837] talked with Dallas County Assistant District Attorney\r\nWilliam F. Alexander about insufficient fund checks which a friend had\r\npassed,[C6-838] and submitted advertising copy for his nightclubs to\r\nthe Dallas Morning News.[C6-839]\r\n\r\nRuby’s evening activities on Thursday, November 21, were a combination\r\nof business and pleasure. At approximately 7:30 p.m., he drove Larry\r\nCrafard to the Vegas Club which Crafard was overseeing because Ruby’s\r\nsister, Eva Grant, who normally managed the club, was convalescing\r\nfrom a recent illness.[C6-840] Thereafter, Ruby returned to the\r\nCarousel Club and conversed for about an hour with Lawrence Meyers,\r\na Chicago businessman.[C6-841] Between 9:45 and 10:45 p.m., Ruby had\r\ndinner with Ralph Paul, his close friend and financial backer. While\r\ndining Ruby spoke briefly with a Dallas Morning News employee, Don\r\nCampbell, who suggested that they go to the Castaway Club, but Ruby\r\ndeclined.[C6-842] Thereafter, Ruby returned to the Carousel Club where\r\nhe acted as master of ceremonies for his show and peacefully ejected an\r\nunruly patron.[C6-843] At about midnight Ruby rejoined Meyers at the\r\nBon Vivant Room of the Dallas Cabana where they met Meyers’ brother\r\nand sister-in-law.[C6-844] Neither Ralph Paul nor Lawrence Meyers\r\nrecalled that Ruby mentioned the President’s trip to Dallas.[C6-845]\r\nLeaving Meyers at the Cabana after a brief visit, Ruby returned to\r\nclose the Carousel Club and obtain the night’s receipts.[C6-846] He\r\nthen went to the Vegas Club which he helped Larry Crafard close for the\r\nnight;[C6-847] and, as late as 2:30 a.m., Ruby was seen eating at a\r\nrestaurant near the Vegas Club.[C6-848]\r\n\r\n_Friday morning at the Dallas Morning News._--Jack Ruby learned of the\r\nshooting of President Kennedy while in the second-floor advertising\r\noffices of the Dallas Morning News, five blocks from the Texas School\r\nBook Depository, where he had come Friday morning to place regular\r\nweekend advertisements for his two nightclubs.[C6-849] On arriving at\r\nthe newspaper building at about 11 or 11:30 a.m., he talked briefly\r\nwith two newspaper employees concerning some diet pills he had\r\nrecommended to them.[C6-850] Ruby then went to the office of Morning\r\nNews columnist, Tony Zoppi, where he states he obtained a brochure\r\non his new master of ceremonies that he wanted to use in preparing\r\ncopy for his advertisements.[C6-851] Proceeding to the advertising\r\ndepartment, he spoke with advertising employee Don Campbell from\r\nabout noon until 12:25 p.m. when Campbell left the office.[C6-852] In\r\naddition to the business at hand, much of the conversation concerned\r\nRuby’s unhappiness over the financial condition of his clubs and\r\nhis professed ability to handle the physical fights which arose in\r\nconnection with the clubs.[C6-853] According to Campbell, Ruby did\r\nnot mention the Presidential motorcade nor did he display any unusual\r\nbehavior.[C6-854]\r\n\r\nAbout 10 minutes after the President had been shot but before word had\r\nspread to the second floor, John Newnam, an advertising department\r\nemployee, observed Ruby sitting at the same spot where Campbell had\r\nleft him. At that time Ruby had completed the advertisement, which\r\nhe had apparently begun to compose when Campbell departed, and was\r\nreading a newspaper.[C6-855] To Newnam, Ruby voiced criticism of the\r\nblack-bordered advertisement entitled “Welcome, Mr. Kennedy” appearing\r\nin the morning paper and bearing the name of Bernard Weissman as the\r\nchairman of the committee sponsoring the advertisement.[C6-856] (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1031, p. 294.) According to Eva Grant, Ruby’s\r\nsister, he had telephoned her earlier in the morning to call her\r\nattention to the ad.[C6-857] At about 12:45 p.m., an employee entered\r\nthe office and announced that shots had been fired at the President.\r\nNewnam remembered that Ruby responded with a look of “stunned\r\ndisbelief.”[C6-858]\r\n\r\nShortly afterward, according to Newnam, “confusion reigned” in\r\nthe office as advertisers telephoned to cancel advertising they\r\nhad placed for the weekend.[C6-859] Ruby appears to have believed\r\nthat some of those cancellations were motivated by the Weissman\r\nadvertisement.[C6-860] After Newnam accepted a few telephone calls,\r\nhe and Ruby walked toward a room where other persons were watching\r\ntelevision.[C6-861] One of the newspaper employees recalled that Ruby\r\nthen appeared “obviously shaken, and an ashen color--just very pale * *\r\n*”[C6-862] showed little disposition to converse,[C6-863] and sat for a\r\nwhile with a dazed expression in his eyes.[C6-864]\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes, Ruby placed telephone calls to Andrew Armstrong,\r\nhis assistant at the Carousel Club, and to his sister, Mrs. Grant. He\r\ntold Armstrong, “If anything happens we are going to close the club”\r\nand said he would see him in about 30 minutes.[C6-865] During the call\r\nto his sister, Ruby again referred to the Weissman advertisement;\r\nat one point he put the telephone to Newnam’s ear, and Newnam heard\r\nMrs. Grant exclaim, “My God, what do they want?” It was Newnam’s\r\nrecollection that Ruby tried to calm her.[C6-866]\r\n\r\nRuby testified that after calling his sister he said, “John, I will\r\nhave to leave Dallas.”[C6-867] Ruby explained to the Commission:\r\n\r\n    I don’t know why I said that, but it is a funny reaction that\r\n    you feel; the city is terribly let down by the tragedy that\r\n    happened. And I said, “John, I am not opening up tonight.”\r\n\r\n    And I don’t know what else transpired. I know people were just\r\n    heartbroken * * *.\r\n\r\n    I left the building and I went down and I got in my car and I\r\n    couldn’t stop crying. * * * [C6-868]\r\n\r\nNewnam estimated that Ruby departed from the Morning News at about\r\n1:30 p.m., but other testimony indicated that Ruby may have left\r\nearlier.[C6-869]\r\n\r\n_Ruby’s alleged visit to Parkland Hospital._--The Commission has\r\ninvestigated claims that Jack Ruby was at Parkland Hospital at about\r\n1:30 p.m., when a Presidential press secretary, Malcolm Kilduff,\r\nannounced that President Kennedy was dead. Seth Kantor, a newspaperman\r\nwho had previously met Ruby in Dallas, reported and later testified\r\nthat Jack Ruby stopped him momentarily inside the main entrance to\r\nParkland Hospital some time between 1:30 and 2 p.m., Friday, November\r\n22, 1963.[C6-870] The only other person besides Kantor who recalled\r\nseeing Ruby at the hospital did not make known her observation until\r\nApril 1964, had never seen Ruby before, allegedly saw him only briefly\r\nthen, had an obstructed view, and was uncertain of the time.[C6-871]\r\nRuby has firmly denied going to Parkland and has stated that he went to\r\nthe Carousel Club upon leaving the Morning News.[C6-872] Video tapes of\r\nthe scene at Parkland do not show Ruby there, although Kantor can be\r\nseen.[C6-873]\r\n\r\nInvestigation has limited the period during which Kantor could have\r\nmet Ruby at Parkland Hospital on Friday to a few minutes before and\r\nafter 1:30 p.m. Telephone company records and the testimony of Andrew\r\nArmstrong established that Ruby arrived at the Carousel Club no later\r\nthan 1:45 p.m. and probably a few minutes earlier.[C6-874] Kantor was\r\nengaged in a long-distance telephone call to his Washington office\r\nfrom 1:02 p.m. until 1:27 p.m.[C6-875] Kantor testified that, after\r\ncompleting that call, he immediately left the building from which he\r\nhad been telephoning, traveled perhaps 100 yards, and entered the main\r\nentrance of the hospital. It was there, as he walked through a small\r\ndoorway, that he believed he saw Jack Ruby, who, Kantor said, tugged at\r\nhis coattails and asked, “Should I close my places for the next three\r\nnights, do you think?” Kantor recalled that he turned briefly to Ruby\r\nand proceeded to the press conference at which the President’s death\r\nwas announced. Kantor was certain he encountered Ruby at Parkland but\r\nhad doubts about the exact time and place.[C6-876]\r\n\r\nKantor probably did not see Ruby at Parkland Hospital in the few\r\nminutes before or after 1:30 p.m., the only time it would have been\r\npossible for Kantor to have done so. If Ruby immediately returned to\r\nthe Carousel Club after Kantor saw him, it would have been necessary\r\nfor him to have covered the distance from Parkland in approximately 10\r\nor 15 minutes in order to have arrived at the club before 1:45 p.m.,\r\nwhen a telephone call was placed at Ruby’s request to his entertainer,\r\nKaren Bennett Carlin.[C6-877] At a normal driving speed under normal\r\nconditions the trip can be made in 9 or 10 minutes.[C6-878] However, it\r\nis likely that congested traffic conditions on November 22 would have\r\nextended the driving time.[C6-879] Even if Ruby had been able to drive\r\nfrom Parkland to the Carousel in 15 minutes, his presence at the Dallas\r\nMorning News until after 1 p.m., and at the Carousel prior to 1:45\r\np.m., would have made his visit at Parkland exceedingly brief. Since\r\nRuby was observed at the Dallas Police Department during a 2 hour\r\nperiod after 11 p.m. on Friday,[C6-880] when Kantor was also present,\r\nand since Kantor did not remember seeing Ruby there,[C6-881] Kantor\r\nmay have been mistaken about both the time and the place that he saw\r\nRuby. When seeing Ruby, Kantor was preoccupied with the important event\r\nthat a press conference represented. Both Ruby and Kantor were present\r\nat another important event, a press conference held about midnight,\r\nNovember 22, in the assembly room of the Dallas Police Department. It\r\nis conceivable that Kantor’s encounter with Ruby occurred at that time,\r\nperhaps near the small doorway there.[C6-882]\r\n\r\n_Ruby’s decision to close his clubs._--Upon arriving at the Carousel\r\nClub shortly before 1:45 p.m., Ruby instructed Andrew Armstrong, the\r\nCarousel’s bartender, to notify employees that the club would be\r\nclosed that night.[C6-883] During much of the next hour Ruby talked\r\nby telephone to several persons who were or had been especially close\r\nto him, and the remainder of the time he watched television and spoke\r\nwith Armstrong and Larry Crafard about the assassination.[C6-884] At\r\n1:51 p.m., Ruby telephoned Ralph Paul in Arlington, Tex., to say that\r\nhe was going to close his clubs. He urged Paul to do likewise with his\r\ndrive-in restaurant.[C6-885] Unable to reach Alice Nichols, a former\r\ngirl friend, who was at lunch, Ruby telephoned his sister, Eileen\r\nKaminsky, in Chicago.[C6-886] Mrs. Kaminsky described her brother as\r\ncompletely unnerved and crying about President Kennedy’s death.[C6-887]\r\nTo Mrs. Nichols, whose return call caused Ruby to cut short his\r\nconversation with Mrs. Kaminsky, Ruby expressed shock over the\r\nassassination.[C6-888] Although Mrs. Nichols had dated Ruby for nearly\r\n11 years, she was surprised to hear from him on November 22 since they\r\nhad not seen one another socially for some time.[C6-889] Thereafter,\r\nRuby telephoned at 2:37 p.m. to Alex Gruber, a boyhood friend from\r\nChicago who was living in Los Angeles.[C6-890] Gruber recalled that in\r\ntheir 3-minute conversation Ruby talked about a dog he had promised to\r\nsend Gruber, a carwash business Gruber had considered starting, and the\r\nassassination.[C6-891] Ruby apparently lost his self-control during the\r\nconversation and terminated it.[C6-892] However, 2 minutes after that\r\ncall ended, Ruby telephoned again to Ralph Paul.[C6-893]\r\n\r\nUpon leaving the Carousel Club at about 3:15 p.m., Ruby drove to Eva\r\nGrant’s home but left soon after he arrived, to obtain some weekend\r\nfood for his sister and himself.[C6-894] He first returned to the\r\nCarousel Club and directed Larry Crafard to prepare a sign indicating\r\nthat the club would be closed; however, Ruby instructed Crafard not\r\nto post the sign until later in the evening to avoid informing his\r\ncompetitors that he would be closed.[C6-895] (See Commission Exhibit\r\n2427, p. 339.) Before leaving the club, Ruby telephoned Mrs. Grant who\r\nreminded him to purchase food.[C6-896] As a result he went to the Ritz\r\nDelicatessen, about two blocks from the Carousel Club, and bought a\r\ngreat quantity of cold cuts.[C6-897]\r\n\r\nRuby probably arrived a second time at his sister’s home close to 5:30\r\np.m. and remained for about 2 hours. He continued his rapid rate of\r\ntelephone calls, ate sparingly, became ill, and attempted to get some\r\nrest.[C6-898] While at the apartment, Ruby decided to close his clubs\r\nfor 3 days. He testified that after talking to Don Saffran, a columnist\r\nfor the Dallas Times-Herald:\r\n\r\n    I put the receiver down and talked to my sister, and I said,\r\n    “Eva, what shall we do?”\r\n\r\n    And she said, “Jack, let’s close for the 3 days.” She said, “We\r\n    don’t have anything anyway, but we owe it to--” (chokes up.)\r\n\r\n    So I called Don Saffran back immediately and I said, “Don, we\r\n    decided to close for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.”\r\n\r\n    And he said, “Okay.”[C6-899]\r\n\r\nRuby then telephoned the Dallas Morning News to cancel his\r\nadvertisement and, when unable to do so, he changed his ad to read\r\nthat his clubs would be closed for the weekend.[C6-900] Ruby also\r\ntelephoned Cecil Hamlin, a friend of many years. Sounding very “broken\r\nup,” he told Hamlin that he had closed the clubs since he thought\r\nmost people would not be in the mood to visit them and that he felt\r\nconcern for President Kennedy’s “kids.”[C6-901] Thereafter he made two\r\ncalls to ascertain when services at Temple Shearith Israel would be\r\nheld.[C6-902] He placed a second call to Alice Nichols to tell her of\r\nhis intention to attend those services[C6-903] and phoned Larry Crafard\r\nat the Carousel to ask whether he had received any messages.[C6-904]\r\nEva Grant testified:\r\n\r\n    When he was leaving, he looked pretty bad. This I remember. I\r\n    can’t explain it to you. He looked too broken, a broken man\r\n    already. He did make the remark, he said, “I never felt so bad\r\n    in my life, even when Ma or Pa died.”\r\n\r\n    So I said, “Well, Pa was an old man. He was almost 89 years. *\r\n    * *”[C6-905]\r\n\r\n_Friday evening._--Ruby is uncertain whether he went directly from his\r\nsister’s home to his apartment or possibly first to his club.[C6-906]\r\nAt least 5 witnesses recall seeing a man they believe was Ruby on the\r\nthird floor of police headquarters at times they have estimated between\r\n6 and 9 p.m.;[C6-907] however, it is not clear that Ruby was present\r\nat the Police and Courts Building before 11 p.m. With respect to three\r\nof the witnesses, it is doubtful that the man observed was Ruby. Two\r\nof those persons had not known Ruby previously and described wearing\r\napparel which differed both from Ruby’s known dress that night and\r\nfrom his known wardrobe.[C6-908] The third, who viewed from the rear\r\nthe person he believed was Ruby, said the man unsuccessfully attempted\r\nto enter the homicide office.[C6-909] Of the police officers on duty\r\nnear homicide at the time of the alleged event, only one remembered\r\nthe episode, and he said the man in question definitely was not\r\nRuby.[C6-910] The remaining witnesses knew or talked with Ruby, and\r\ntheir testimony leaves little doubt that they did see him on the third\r\nfloor at some point on Friday night; however the possibility remains\r\nthat they observed Ruby later in the evening, when his presence is\r\nconclusively established.[C6-911] Ruby has denied being at the police\r\ndepartment Friday night before approximately 11:15 p.m.[C6-912]\r\n\r\nIn any event, Ruby eventually returned to his own apartment before 9\r\np.m. There he telephoned Ralph Paul but was unable to persuade Paul\r\nto join him at synagogue services.[C6-913] Shortly after 9 p.m., Ruby\r\ncalled the Chicago home of his oldest brother, Hyman Rubenstein,\r\nand two of his sisters, Marion Carroll and Ann Volpert.[C6-914]\r\nHyman Rubenstein testified that, during the call, his brother was so\r\ndisturbed about the situation in Dallas that he mentioned selling his\r\nbusiness and returning to Chicago.[C6-915] From his apartment, Ruby\r\ndrove to Temple Shearith Israel, arriving near the end of a 2-hour\r\nservice which had begun at 8 p.m.[C6-916] Rabbi Hillel Silverman, who\r\ngreeted him among the crowd leaving the services[C6-917] was surprised\r\nthat Ruby, who appeared depressed, mentioned only his sister’s recent\r\nillness and said nothing about the assassination.[C6-918]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (COMMISSION EXHIBIT 2427)\r\n\r\n“CLOSED” SIGN POSTED IN THE WINDOW OF THE CAROUSEL CLUB AND RUBY’S\r\nNEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENT ANNOUNCING THAT THE VEGAS AND CAROUSEL CLUBS\r\nWILL BE CLOSED\r\n\r\n\r\nDALLAS TIMES HERALD SATURDAY, NOV. 23, 1963 PAGE A-13]\r\n\r\nRuby related that, after joining in the postservice\r\nrefreshments,[C6-919] he drove by some night clubs, noticing whether\r\nor not they had been closed as his were.[C6-920] He testified that,\r\nas he drove toward town, a radio announcement that the Dallas police\r\nwere working overtime prompted the thought that he might bring those at\r\npolice headquarters something to eat.[C6-921] At about 10:30 p.m., he\r\nstopped at a delicatessen near the Vegas Club and purchased 8 kosher\r\nsandwiches and 10 soft drinks.[C6-922] From the delicatessen, he called\r\nthe police department but was told that the officers had already\r\neaten.[C6-923] He said he then tried to offer the food to employees\r\nat radio station KLIF but failed in several attempts to obtain the\r\nprivate night line number to the station.[C6-924] On three occasions\r\nbetween phone calls, Ruby spoke with a group of students whom he did\r\nnot know, lamenting the President’s death, teasing one of the young men\r\nabout being too young for his clubs, borrowing their copy of the Dallas\r\nTimes Herald to see how his advertisements had been run, and stating\r\nthat his clubs were the only ones that had closed because of the\r\nassassination. He also expressed the opinion, as he had earlier in the\r\nday, that the assassination would be harmful to the convention business\r\nin Dallas.[C6-925] Upon leaving the delicatessen with his purchases,\r\nRuby gave the counterman as a tip a card granting free admission to his\r\nclubs.[C6-926] He drove downtown to the police station where he has\r\nsaid he hoped to find an employee from KLIF who could give him the “hot\r\nline” phone number for the radio station.[C6-927]\r\n\r\n_The third floor of police headquarters._--Ruby is known to have\r\nmade his way, by about 11:30 p.m., to the third floor of the Dallas\r\nPolice Department where reporters were congregated near the homicide\r\nbureau.[C6-928] Newsman John Rutledge, one of those who may well have\r\nbeen mistaken as to time, gave the following description of his first\r\nencounter with Ruby at the police station:\r\n\r\n    I saw Jack and two out-of-state reporters, whom I did not know,\r\n    leave the elevator door and proceed toward those television\r\n    cameras, to go around the corner where Captain Fritz’s office\r\n    was. Jack walked between them. These two out-of-state reporters\r\n    had big press cards pinned on their coats, great big red ones,\r\n    I think they said “President Kennedy’s Visit to Dallas--Press”,\r\n    or something like that. And Jack didn’t have one, but the man\r\n    on either side of him did. And they walked pretty rapidly from\r\n    the elevator area past the policeman, and Jack was bent over\r\n    like this--writing on a piece of paper, and talking to one\r\n    of the reporters, and pointing to something on the piece of\r\n    paper, he was kind of hunched over.[C6-929]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 2424\r\n\r\nJack Ruby at press conference in basement assembly room about midnight\r\nNovember 22, 1963. (Jack Ruby is the individual in the dark suit, back\r\nrow, right-hand side, wearing horn-rimmed glasses.)] Detective Augustus\r\nM. Eberhardt, who also recalled that he first saw Ruby earlier in the\r\nevening, said Ruby carried a note pad and professed to be a translator\r\nfor the Israeli press. He remembered Ruby’s remarking how unfortunate\r\nthe assassination was for the city of Dallas and that it was “hard to\r\nrealize that a complete nothing, a zero like that, could kill a man\r\nlike President Kennedy * * *.”[C6-930]\r\n\r\nVideo tapes confirm Ruby’s statement that he was present on the\r\nthird floor when Chief Jesse E. Curry and District Attorney Henry M.\r\nWade announced that Oswald would be shown to the newsmen at a press\r\nconference in the basement.[C6-931] Though he has said his original\r\npurpose was only to locate a KLIF employee, Ruby has stated that while\r\nat the police station he was “carried away with the excitement of\r\nhistory.”[C6-932] He accompanied the newsmen to the basement to observe\r\nOswald. His presence at the midnight news conference is established\r\nby television tapes and by at least 12 witnesses.[C6-933] When Oswald\r\narrived, Ruby, together with a number of newsmen, was standing atop\r\na table on one side of the room.[C6-934] (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n2424, p. 341.) Oswald was taken from the room after a brief appearance,\r\nand Ruby remained to hear reporters question District Attorney Wade.\r\nDuring the press conference, Wade stated that Oswald would probably be\r\nmoved to the county jail at the beginning of the next week.[C6-935] In\r\nanswer to one question, Wade said that Oswald belonged to the “Free\r\nCuba Committee.” A few reporters spoke up correcting Wade and among the\r\nvoices was that of Jack Ruby.[C6-936]\r\n\r\nRuby later followed the district attorney out of the press conference,\r\nwalked up to him and, according to Wade, said “Hi Henry * * * Don’t you\r\nknow me? * * * I am Jack Ruby, I run the Vegas Club. * * *”[C6-937]\r\nRuby also introduced himself to Justice of the Peace David L. Johnston,\r\nshook his hand, gave Johnston a business card to the Carousel Club,\r\nand, upon learning Johnston’s official position, shook Johnston’s hand\r\nagain.[C6-938] After talking with Johnston, he gave another card to\r\nIcarus M. Pappas, a reporter for New York radio station WNEW.[C6-939]\r\nFrom a representative of radio station KBOX in Dallas, Ruby obtained\r\nthe “hot line” telephone number to KLIF.[C6-940] He then called the\r\nstation and told one of the employees that he would like to come up to\r\ndistribute the sandwiches and cold drinks he had purchased.[C6-941]\r\nObserving Pappas holding a telephone line open and attempting to get\r\nthe attention of District Attorney Wade, Ruby directed Wade to Pappas,\r\nwho proceeded to interview the district attorney.[C6-942] Ruby then\r\ncalled KLIF a second time and offered to secure an interview with Wade;\r\nhe next summoned Wade to his phone, whereupon KLIF recorded a telephone\r\ninterview with the district attorney.[C6-943] A few minutes later. Ruby\r\nencountered Russ Knight, a reporter from KLIF who had left the station\r\nfor the police department at the beginning of Ruby’s second telephone\r\ncall. Ruby directed Knight to Wade and waited a short distance away\r\nwhile the reporter conducted another interview with the district\r\nattorney.[C6-944]\r\n\r\n_At radio station KLIF._--When Ruby left police headquarters, he\r\ndrove to radio station KLIF, arriving at approximately 1:45 a.m. and\r\nremaining for about 45 minutes.[C6-945] After first distributing his\r\nsandwiches and soft drinks, Ruby settled in the newsroom for the 2 a.m.\r\nnewscast in which he was credited with suggesting that Russ Knight ask\r\nDistrict Attorney Wade whether or not Oswald was sane.[C6-946] After\r\nthe newscast, Ruby gave a Carousel card to one KLIF employee, although\r\nanother did not recall that Ruby was promoting his club as he normally\r\ndid.[C6-947] When speaking with KLIF’s Danny Patrick McCurdy, Ruby\r\nmentioned that he was going to close his clubs for the weekend and\r\nthat he would rather lose $1,200 or $1,500 than remain open at that\r\ntime in the Nation’s history. McCurdy remembered that Ruby “looked\r\nrather pale to me as he was talking to me and he kept looking at the\r\nfloor.”[C6-948] To announcer Glen Duncan, Ruby expressed satisfaction\r\nthat the evidence was mounting against Oswald. Duncan said that Ruby\r\ndid not appear to be grieving but, instead, seemed pleased about the\r\npersonal contact he had had with the investigation earlier in the\r\nevening.[C6-949]\r\n\r\nRuby left the radio station accompanied by Russ Knight. Engaging Knight\r\nin a short conversation, Ruby handed him a radio script entitled\r\n“Heroism” from a conservative radio program called “Life Line.” It was\r\napparently one of the scripts that had come into Ruby’s hands a few\r\nweeks before at the Texas Products Show when Hunt Foods were including\r\nsuch scripts with samples of their products.[C6-950] The script\r\nextolled the virtues of those who embark upon risky business ventures\r\nand stand firmly for causes they believe to be correct.[C6-951] Ruby\r\nasked Knight’s views on the script and suggested that there was a\r\ngroup of “radicals” in Dallas which hated President Kennedy and that\r\nthe owner of the radio station should editorialize against this group.\r\nKnight could not clearly determine whether Ruby had reference to\r\npersons who sponsored programs like “Life Line” or to those who held\r\nleftwing views.[C6-952] Knight gained the impression that Ruby believed\r\nsuch persons, whoever they might be, were partially responsible for the\r\nassassination.[C6-953]\r\n\r\n_Early morning of November 23._--At about 2:30 a.m., Ruby entered\r\nhis automobile and departed for the Dallas Times-Herald Building. En\r\nroute, he stopped for about an hour to speak with Kay Helen Coleman,\r\none of his dancers, and Harry Olsen, a member of the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment, who had hailed him from a parking garage at the corner\r\nof Jackson and Field Streets. The couple were crying and extremely\r\nupset over the assassination. At one point, according to Ruby, the\r\npolice officer remarked that “they should cut this guy [Oswald] inch\r\nby inch into ribbons,” and the dancer said that “in England they\r\nwould drag him through the streets and would have hung him.”[C6-954]\r\nAlthough Ruby failed to mention this episode during his first two FBI\r\ninterviews,[C6-955] he later explained that his reason for failing to\r\ndo so was that he did not “want to involve them in anything, because\r\nit was supposed to be a secret that he [the police officer] was going\r\nwith this young lady.”[C6-956] About 6 weeks after the assassination,\r\nOlsen left the Dallas Police Department and married Miss Coleman. Both\r\nOlsen and his wife testified that they were greatly upset during their\r\nlengthy conversation with Ruby early Saturday morning; but Mrs. Olsen\r\ndenied and Olsen did not recall the remarks ascribed to them.[C6-957]\r\nThe Olsens claimed instead that Ruby had cursed Oswald.[C6-958] Mrs.\r\nOlsen also mentioned that Ruby expressed sympathy for Mrs. Kennedy and\r\nher children.[C6-959]\r\n\r\nFrom Jackson and Field Streets, Ruby drove to the Dallas Times-Herald,\r\nwhere he talked for about 15 minutes with composing room employee Roy\r\nPryor, who had just finished a shift at 4 a.m. Ruby mentioned that\r\nhe had seen Oswald earlier in the night, that he had corrected Henry\r\nWade in connection with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and that\r\nhe had set up a telephone interview with Wade. Pryor testified that\r\nRuby explicitly stated to him that he believed he was in good favor\r\nwith the district attorney.[C6-960] Recalling that Ruby described\r\nOswald as a “little weasel of a guy” and was emotionally concerned\r\nabout the President’s wife and children, Pryor also was impressed by\r\nRuby’s sorrowful mood and remembered that, as he talked, Ruby shook a\r\nnewspaper to emphasize his concern over the assassination.[C6-961]\r\n\r\nWhen Pryor left the composing room, Ruby remained and continued\r\nspeaking with other employees, including Arthur Watherwax and the\r\nforeman, Clyde Gadash. Ruby, who often visited the Times-Herald at\r\nthat early morning hour in connection with his ads, sought Watherwax’s\r\nviews on his decision to close his clubs and indicated he was going\r\nto attempt to persuade other club owners to do likewise. Watherwax\r\ndescribed Ruby as “pretty shaken up” about the assassination and at the\r\nsame time “excited” that he had attended Oswald’s Friday night press\r\nconference.[C6-962]\r\n\r\nWhile at the Times-Herald, Ruby displayed to the composing room\r\nemployees a “twistboard” he had previously promised to Gadash.[C6-963]\r\nThe twistboard was an exercising device consisting of two pieces of\r\nhardened materials joined together by a lazy susan bearing so that\r\none piece could remain stationary on the floor while a person stood\r\natop it and swiveled to and fro.[C6-964] Ruby had been trying to\r\npromote sales of the board in the weeks before President Kennedy was\r\nkilled.[C6-965] Considerable merriment developed when one of the women\r\nemployees at the Times-Herald demonstrated the board, and Ruby himself,\r\nput on a demonstration for those assembled.[C6-966] He later testified:\r\n“* * * not that I wanted to get in with the hilarity of frolicking,\r\nbut he [Gadash] asked me to show him, and the other men gathered\r\naround.”[C6-967] Gadash agreed that Ruby’s general mood was one of\r\nsorrow.[C6-968]\r\n\r\nAt about 4:30 a.m., Ruby drove from the Dallas Times-Herald to his\r\napartment where he awakened his roommate George Senator.[C6-969] During\r\nhis visit in the composing room Ruby had expressed the view that the\r\nWeissman advertisement was an effort to discredit the Jews.[C6-970]\r\nSenator testified that when Ruby returned to the apartment, he began\r\nto discuss the Weissman advertisement and also a signboard he had seen\r\nin Dallas urging that Chief Justice Earl Warren be impeached.[C6-971]\r\nShortly thereafter, Ruby telephoned Larry Crafard at the Carousel\r\nClub.[C6-972] He told Crafard to meet him and Senator at the Nichols\r\nGarage adjacent to the Carousel Club and to bring a Polaroid camera\r\nkept in the club.[C6-973] After Crafard joined Ruby and Senator, the\r\nthree men drove to the “Impeach Earl Warren” sign near Hall Avenue and\r\nCentral Expressway in Dallas. There Ruby instructed Crafard to take\r\nthree photographs of the billboard. Believing that the sign and the\r\nWeissman newspaper ad might somehow be connected, Ruby noted on the\r\nback of an envelope a name and post office box number that appeared on\r\nthe sign.[C6-974] According to George Senator:\r\n\r\n    * * * when he was looking at the sign and taking pictures of\r\n    it, and the newspaper ad, * * * this is where he really wanted\r\n    to know the whys or why these things had to be out. He is\r\n    trying to combine these two together, which I did hear him say,\r\n    “This is the work of the John Birch Society or the Communist\r\n    Party or maybe a combination of both.”[C6-975]\r\n\r\nPursuing a possible connection between the billboard and the newspaper\r\nadvertisement, Ruby drove to the post office and asked a postal\r\nemployee for the name of the man who had rented the box indicated on\r\nthe billboard, but the employee said that he could not provide such\r\ninformation. Ruby inspected the box, however, and was upset to find it\r\nstuffed with mail.[C6-976] The three men then drove to a coffeeshop\r\nwhere Ruby continued to discuss the two advertisements. After about 30\r\nminutes, they left the coffeeshop. Crafard was taken to the Carousel\r\nClub; Ruby and Senator returned to their apartment,[C6-977] and Ruby\r\nretired at about 6 a.m.[C6-978]\r\n\r\n_The morning and afternoon of November 23._--At 8 or 8:30 a.m. Crafard,\r\nwho had been asked to feed Ruby’s dogs, telephoned Ruby at his\r\napartment to inquire about food for the animals.[C6-979] Ruby forgot\r\nthat he had told Crafard he did not plan to go to bed and reprimanded\r\nCrafard for waking him.[C6-980] A few hours thereafter Crafard\r\nassembled his few belongings, took from the Carousel cash register $5\r\nof money due him from Ruby, left a receipt and thank-you note, and\r\nbegan hitchhiking to Michigan. Later that day, Andrew Armstrong found\r\nthe note and telephoned Ruby.[C6-981]\r\n\r\nRuby apparently did not return to bed following Crafard’s call. During\r\nthe morning hours, he watched a rabbi deliver on television a moving\r\neulogy of President Kennedy.[C6-982] According to Ruby, the rabbi:\r\n\r\n    went ahead and eulogized that here is a man that fought in\r\n    every battle, went to every country, and had to come back to\r\n    his own country to be shot in the back [starts crying] * * *.\r\n    That created a tremendous emotional feeling for me, the\r\n    way he said that. Prior to all the other times, I was carried\r\n    away.[C6-983]\r\n\r\nAn employee from the Carousel Club who telephoned Ruby during the\r\nmorning remembered that his “voice was shaking” when he spoke of the\r\nassassination.[C6-984]\r\n\r\nRuby has stated that, upon leaving his apartment some time between\r\nnoon and 1:30 p.m., he drove to Dealey Plaza where a police officer,\r\nwho noted Ruby’s solemnity, pointed out to him the window from which\r\nthe rifleshots had been fired the day before.[C6-985] Ruby related\r\nthat he inspected the wreaths that had been placed in memory of the\r\nPresident and became filled with emotion while speaking with the\r\npolice officer.[C6-986] Ruby introduced himself to a reporter for\r\nradio station KRLD who was working inside a mobile news unit at the\r\nplaza; the newsman mentioned to Ruby that he had heard of Ruby’s help\r\nto KLIF in obtaining an interview with Henry Wade, and Ruby pointed\r\nout to the reporter that Capt. J. Will Fritz and Chief Curry were then\r\nin the vicinity. Thereafter, the newsman interviewed and photographed\r\nthe officers.[C6-987] Ruby said that he next drove home and returned\r\ndowntown to Sol’s Turf Bar on Commerce Street.[C6-988]\r\n\r\nThe evidence indicated, however, that sometime after leaving Dealey\r\nPlaza, Ruby went to the Nichols Parking Garage adjacent to the Carousel\r\nClub, where he was seen by Garnett C. Hallmark, general manager of\r\nthe garage, and Tom Brown, an attendant. Brown believed that at about\r\n1:30 p.m. he heard Ruby mention Chief Curry’s name in a telephone\r\nconversation from the garage. Brown also recalled that, before finally\r\ndeparting, Ruby asked him to inform acquaintances whom he expected to\r\nstop by the garage that the Carousel would be closed.[C6-989] Hallmark\r\ntestified that Ruby drove into the garage at about 3 p.m., walked to\r\nthe telephone, inquired whether or not a competing burlesque club would\r\nbe closed that night, and told Hallmark that he (Ruby) was “acting\r\nlike a reporter.”[C6-990] Hallmark then heard Ruby address someone\r\nat the other end of the telephone as “Ken” and caught portions of a\r\nconversation concerning the transfer of Oswald.[C6-991] Hallmark said\r\nRuby never called Oswald by name but used the pronoun “he” and remarked\r\nto the recipient of the call, “you know I’ll be there.”[C6-992]\r\n\r\nKen Dowe, a KLIF announcer, to whom Ruby made at least two telephone\r\ncalls within a short span of time Saturday afternoon, confirmed that\r\nhe was probably the person to whom Hallmark and Brown overheard Ruby\r\nspeaking. In one call to Dowe, Ruby asked whether the station knew\r\nwhen Oswald would be moved; and, in another, he stated he was going to\r\nattempt to locate Henry Wade.[C6-993] After Ruby finished his calls, he\r\nwalked onto Commerce Street, passed the Carousel Club, and returned a\r\nfew minutes later to get his car.[C6-994]\r\n\r\nRuby’s comment that he was “acting like a reporter” and that he would\r\nbe at the Oswald transfer suggests that Ruby may have spent part of\r\nSaturday afternoon shuttling back and forth from the Police and Courts\r\nBuilding to Dealey Plaza. Such activity would explain the fact that\r\nTom Brown at the Nichols Garage believed he saw Ruby at 1:30 p.m.\r\nwhile Garnett Hallmark placed Ruby at the garage at 3 p.m. It would\r\nalso explain Ken Dowe’s receiving two phone calls from Ruby. The\r\ntestimony of five news reporters supports the possibility that Ruby\r\nwas at the Police and Courts Building Saturday afternoon.[C6-995]\r\nOne stated that Ruby provided sandwiches for newsmen on duty there\r\nSaturday afternoon, although no news representative has mentioned\r\npersonally receiving such sandwiches.[C6-996] Another testified that\r\nhe received a card to the Carousel Club from Ruby about 4 p.m. that\r\nday at the police station.[C6-997] A third believed he saw Ruby enter\r\nan office in which Henry Wade was working, but no one else reported\r\na similar event.[C6-998] The remaining two witnesses mentioned no\r\nspecific activities.[C6-999] None of the persons who believed they saw\r\nRuby at the police department on Saturday had known him previously,\r\nand no police officer has reported Ruby’s presence on that day. Ruby\r\nhas not mentioned such a visit. The Commission, therefore, reached no\r\nfirm conclusion as to whether or not Ruby visited the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment on Saturday.\r\n\r\nShortly after 3 p.m. Ruby went to Sol’s Turf Bar on Commerce Street\r\nwhere he remained for about 45 minutes. Ruby, a nondrinker, stated\r\nthat he visited Sol’s for the purpose of talking with his accountant,\r\nwho customarily prepared the bar’s payroll on Saturday afternoon.\r\nThe accountant testified, however, that he saw Ruby only briefly\r\nand mentioned no business conversation with Ruby.[C6-1000] Ruby\r\nwas first noticed at the Turf Bar by jeweler Frank Bellochio, who,\r\nafter seeing Ruby, began to berate the people of Dallas for the\r\nassassination.[C6-1001] Ruby disagreed and, when Bellochio said he\r\nmight close his jewelry business and leave Dallas, Ruby attempted to\r\ncalm him, saying that there were many good citizens in Dallas.[C6-1002]\r\nIn response, Bellochio pointed to a copy of the Bernard Weissman\r\nadvertisement.[C6-1003] To Bellochio’s bewilderment, Ruby then said\r\nhe believed that the advertisement was the work of a group attempting\r\nto create anti-Semitic feelings in Dallas and that he had learned\r\nfrom the Dallas Morning News that the ad had been paid for partly in\r\ncash.[C6-1004] Ruby thereupon produced one of the photographs he had\r\ntaken Saturday morning of the “Impeach Earl Warren” sign and excitedly\r\nbegan to rail against the sign as if he agreed with Bellochio’s\r\noriginal criticism of Dallas.[C6-1005] He “seemed to be taking two\r\nsides--he wasn’t coherent,” Bellochio testified.[C6-1006] When\r\nBellochio saw Ruby’s photographs, which Bellochio thought supported\r\nhis argument against Dallas, he walked to the front of the bar and\r\nshowed them to Tom Apple, with whom he had been previously arguing. In\r\nApple’s presence, Bellochio asked Ruby for one of the pictures but Ruby\r\nrefused, mentioning that he regarded the pictures as a scoop.[C6-1007]\r\nBellochio testified: “I spoke to Tom and said a few more words to\r\nTom, and Ruby was gone--never said ‘Goodbye’ or ‘I’ll be seeing\r\nyou.’”[C6-1008]\r\n\r\nRuby may have left in order to telephone Stanley Kaufman, a friend\r\nand attorney who had represented him in civil matters.[C6-1009]\r\nKaufman testified that, at approximately 4 p.m., Ruby called him\r\nabout the Bernard Weissman advertisement. According to Kaufman,\r\n“Jack was particularly impressed with the [black] border as being a\r\ntipoff of some sort--that this man knew the President was going to\r\nbe assassinated * * *.”[C6-1010] Ruby told Kaufman that he had tried\r\nto locate Weissman by going to the post office and said that he was\r\nattempting to be helpful to law enforcement authorities.[C6-1011]\r\n\r\nConsiderable confusion exists as to the place from which Ruby placed\r\nthe call to Kaufman and as to his activities after leaving Sol’s Turf\r\nBar. Eva Grant stated that the call was made from her apartment about\r\n4 p.m.[C6-1012] Ruby, however, believed it was made from the Turf Bar.\r\nHe stated that from the Turf Bar he went to the Carousel and then home\r\nand has not provided additional details on his activities during the\r\nhours from about 4 to 9:30 p.m.[C6-1013] Robert Larkin saw him downtown\r\nat about 6 p.m.[C6-1014] and Andrew Armstrong testified that Ruby\r\nvisited the Carousel Club between 6 and 7 p.m. and remained about an\r\nhour.[C6-1015]\r\n\r\n_At Eva Grant’s apartment Saturday evening._--Eva Grant believed that,\r\nfor most of the period from 4 until 8 p.m., Ruby was at her apartment.\r\nMrs. Grant testified that her brother was still disturbed about the\r\nWeissman advertisement when he arrived, showed her the photograph\r\nof the Warren sign, and recounted his argument with Bellochio about\r\nthe city of Dallas. Still curious as to whether or not Weissman was\r\nJewish, Mrs. Grant asked her brother whether he had been able to find\r\nthe name Bernard Weissman in the Dallas city directory, and Ruby\r\nsaid he had not. Their doubts about Weissman’s existence having been\r\nconfirmed, both began to speculate that the Weissman ad and the Warren\r\nsign were the work of either “Commies or the Birchers,” and were\r\ndesigned to discredit the Jews.[C6-1016] Apparently in the midst of\r\nthat conversation Ruby telephoned Russ Knight at KLIF and, according to\r\nKnight, asked who Earl Warren was.[C6-1017]\r\n\r\nMrs. Grant has testified that Ruby eventually retired to her bedroom\r\nwhere he made telephone calls and slept.[C6-1018] About 8:30 p.m.,\r\nRuby telephoned to Thomas J. O’Grady, a friend and former Dallas\r\npolice officer who had once worked for Ruby as a bouncer. To O’Grady,\r\nRuby mentioned closing the Carousel Club, criticized his competitors\r\nfor remaining open, and complained about the “Impeach Earl Warren”\r\nsign.[C6-1019]\r\n\r\n_Saturday evening at Ruby’s apartment._--By 9:30 p.m., Ruby had\r\napparently returned to his apartment where he received a telephone call\r\nfrom one of his striptease dancers, Karen Bennett Carlin, who, together\r\nwith her husband, had been driven from Fort Worth to Dallas that\r\nevening by another dancer, Nancy Powell.[C6-1020] All three had stopped\r\nat the Colony Club, a burlesque nightclub which competed with the\r\nCarousel.[C6-1021] Mrs. Carlin testified that, in need of money, she\r\ntelephoned Ruby, asked whether the Carousel would be open that night,\r\nand requested part of her salary.[C6-1022] According to Mrs. Carlin,\r\nRuby became angry at the suggestion that the Carousel Club might be\r\nopen for business but told her he would come to the Carousel in about\r\nan hour.[C6-1023]\r\n\r\nThereafter, in a depressed mood, Ruby telephoned his sister Eva Grant,\r\nwho suggested he visit a friend.[C6-1024] Possibly in response to that\r\nsuggestion, Ruby called Lawrence Meyers, a friend from Chicago with\r\nwhom he had visited two nights previously.[C6-1025] Meyers testified\r\nthat, during their telephone conversation, Ruby asked him what he\r\nthought of this “terrible thing,” Ruby then began to criticize his\r\ncompetitors, Abe and Barney Weinstein, for failing to close their\r\nclubs on Saturday night. In the course of his conversation about the\r\nWeinsteins and the assassination, Ruby said “I’ve got to do something\r\nabout this.”[C6-1026] Meyers initially understood that remark to refer\r\nto the Weinsteins. Upon reflection after Oswald was shot, Meyers was\r\nuncertain whether Ruby was referring to his competitors, or to the\r\nassassination of President Kennedy; for Ruby had also spoken at length\r\nabout Mrs. Kennedy and had repeated “those poor people, those poor\r\npeople.”[C6-1027] At the conclusion of their conversation, Meyers\r\ndeclined Ruby’s invitation to join him for a cup of coffee but invited\r\nRuby to join him at the motel. When Ruby also declined, the two agreed\r\nto meet for dinner the following evening.[C6-1028]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Karen Carlin and her husband grew anxious over Ruby’s\r\nfailure to appear with the money they had requested.[C6-1029] After a\r\nsubstantial wait, they returned together to the Nichols Garage where\r\nMr. Carlin telephoned to Ruby.[C6-1030] Carlin testified that he told\r\nRuby they needed money in order to return to Fort Worth[C6-1031]\r\nalthough Nancy Powell testified that she drove the Carlins home that\r\nevening.[C6-1032] Agreeing to advance a small sum, Ruby asked to speak\r\nto Mrs. Carlin, who claimed that Ruby told her that if she needed\r\nmore money she should call him on Sunday.[C6-1033] Thereafter, at\r\nRuby’s request, garage attendant Huey Reeves gave Mrs. Carlin $5, and\r\nshe signed with her stage name “Little Lynn” a receipt which Reeves\r\ntime-stamped 10:33 p.m., November 23.[C6-1034] (See Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 1476, p. 351.)\r\n\r\nInconsistent testimony was developed regarding Ruby’s activities\r\nduring the next 45 minutes. Eva Grant testified that she did not see\r\nher brother on Saturday night after 8 p.m. and has denied calling\r\nRalph Paul herself that night.[C6-1035] Nonetheless, telephone\r\ncompany records revealed that at 10:44 p.m. a call was made to Ralph\r\nPaul’s Bull Pen Drive-In in Arlington, Tex., from Mrs. Grant’s\r\napartment.[C6-1036] It was the only call to Paul from her apartment\r\non Friday or Saturday;[C6-1037] she recalled her brother making such\r\na call that weekend;[C6-1038] and Ralph Paul has testified that Ruby\r\ntelephoned him Saturday night from Eva Grant’s apartment and said he\r\nand his sister were there crying.[C6-1039]\r\n\r\nNineteen-year-old Wanda Helmick, a former waitress at the Bull Pen\r\nDrive-In, first reported in June, 1964 that some time during the\r\nevening she saw the cashier answer the Bull Pan’s pay telephone and\r\nheard her call out to Paul, “It is for you. It is Jack.”[C6-1040]\r\nMrs. Helmick claimed she overheard Paul, speaking on the telephone,\r\nmention something about a gun which, she understood from Paul’s\r\nconversation, the caller had in his possession. She said she also heard\r\nPaul exclaim “Are you crazy?”[C6-1041] She provided no other details\r\nof the conversation. Mrs. Helmick claimed that on Sunday, November 24,\r\nafter Oswald had been shot, she heard Paul repeat the substance of the\r\ncall to other employees as she had related it and that Paul said Ruby\r\nwas the caller.[C6-1042] Ralph Paul denied the allegations of Mrs.\r\nHelmick.[C6-1043] Both Paul and Mrs. Helmick agreed that Paul went home\r\nsoon after the call, apparently about 11 p.m.[C6-1044]\r\n\r\nShortly after 11 p.m., Ruby arrived at the Nichols Garage where\r\nhe repaid Huey Reeves and obtained the receipt Mrs. Carlin had\r\nsigned.[C6-1045] Outside the Carousel, Ruby exchanged greetings with\r\nPolice Officer Harry Olsen and Kay Coleman, whom he had seen late\r\nthe previous night.[C6-1046] Going upstairs to the club, Ruby made a\r\nseries of five brief long-distance phone calls, the first being to the\r\nBull Pen Drive-In at 11:18 p.m. and lasting only 1 minute.[C6-1047]\r\nApparently unable to reach Paul there, Ruby telephoned Paul’s home in\r\nArlington, Tex., for 3 minutes.[C6-1048] A third call was placed at\r\n11:36 p.m. for 2 minutes, again to Paul’s home.[C6-1049] At 11:44 p.m.\r\nRuby telephoned Breck Wall, a friend and entertainer who had gone to\r\nGalveston, Tex., when his show in Dallas suspended its performance out\r\nof respect to President Kennedy. The call lasted 2 minutes.[C6-1050]\r\nThereafter, Ruby immediately placed a 1-minute phone call to Paul’s\r\nhome.[C6-1051]\r\n\r\nAlthough Ruby has mentioned those calls, he has not provided details\r\nto the Commission; however, he has denied ever indicating to Paul or\r\nWall that he was going to shoot Oswald and has said he did not consider\r\nsuch action until Sunday morning.[C6-1052] Ralph Paul did not mention\r\nthe late evening calls in his interview with FBI agents on November\r\n24, 1963.[C6-1053] Later Paul testified that Ruby called him from\r\ndowntown to say that nobody was doing any business.[C6-1054] Breck Wall\r\ntestified that Ruby called him to determine whether or not the American\r\nGuild of Variety Artists (AGVA), which represented striptease dancers\r\nin Dallas, had met concerning a dispute Ruby was having with the\r\nunion.[C6-1055] Ruby’s major difference with AGVA during the preceding\r\n2 weeks had involved what Ruby considered to be AGVA’s failure to\r\nenforce against his 2 competitors, Abe and Barney Weinstein, AGVA’s\r\nban on “striptease contests” and performances by “amateurs.”[C6-1056]\r\nAs recently as Wednesday, November 20, Ruby had telephoned an AGVA\r\nrepresentative in Chicago about that complaint and earlier in\r\nNovember he had unsuccessfully sought to obtain assistance from a\r\nSan Francisco gambler and a Chicagoan reputed for his heavyhanded\r\nunion activities.[C6-1057] Wall testified that Ruby “was very upset\r\nthe President was assassinated and he called Abe Weinstein or Bernie\r\nWeinstein * * * some names for staying open * * *.” Wall added, “he was\r\nvery upset * * * that they did not have the decency to close on such a\r\nday and he thought out of respect they should close.”[C6-1058]\r\n\r\n_Ruby’s activities after midnight._--After completing the series of\r\ncalls to Paul and Wall at 11:48 p.m., Ruby went to the Pago Club,\r\nabout a 10-minute drive from the Carousel Club.[C6-1059] He took a\r\ntable near the middle of the club and, after ordering a Coke, asked\r\nthe waitress in a disapproving tone, “Why are you open?”[C6-1060] When\r\nRobert Norton, the club’s manager, joined Ruby a few minutes later he\r\nexpressed to Ruby his concern as to whether or not it was proper to\r\noperate the Pago Club that evening. Ruby indicated that the Carousel\r\nwas closed but did not criticize Norton for remaining open.[C6-1061]\r\nNorton raised the topic of President Kennedy’s death and said, “[W]e\r\ncouldn’t do enough to the person that [did] this sort of thing.”\r\nNorton added, however, that “Nobody has the right to take the life of\r\nanother one.”[C6-1062] Ruby expressed no strong opinion, and closed the\r\nconversation by saying he was going home because he was tired.[C6-1063]\r\nLater, Ruby told the Commission: “he knew something was wrong with me\r\nin the certain mood I was in.”[C6-1064]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (COMMISSION EXHIBIT 1476)\r\n\r\nCOPY OF RECEIPT GIVEN BY LITTLE LYNN TO HUEY REEVES AT 10:33 P.M.,\r\nNOVEMBER 23, 1963\r\n\r\n\r\n(DOYLE LANE DEPOSITION 5118)\r\n\r\nCOPY OF TELEGRAM ORDER FOR MONEY SENT TO LITTLE LYNN ON NOVEMBER 24,\r\n1963, STAMPED 11:17 A.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n(DOYLE LANE DEPOSITION 5119)\r\n\r\nCOPY OF WESTERN UNION OFFICE COPY OF RECEIPT GIVEN TO JACK RUBY ON\r\nNOVEMBER 24, 1963, STAMPED 11:17 A.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n(COMMISSION EXHIBIT 2420)\r\n\r\nCOPY OF FACE OF WESTERN UNION RECEIPT GIVEN TO JACK RUBY ON NOVEMBER\r\n24, 1963\r\n\r\n\r\n(COMMISSION EXHIBIT 2421)\r\n\r\nCOPY OF BACK OF WESTERN UNION RECEIPT GIVEN TO JACK RUBY ON NOVEMBER\r\n24, 1963, STAMPED 11:16 A.M.]\r\n\r\nRuby testified that he went home after speaking with Norton and went to\r\nbed about 1:30 a.m.[C6-1065] By that time, George Senator claimed, he\r\nhad retired for the night and did not remember Ruby’s return.[C6-1066]\r\nEva Grant testified that her brother telephoned her at about 12:45 a.m.\r\nto learn how she was feeling.[C6-1067]\r\n\r\n_Sunday morning._--Ruby’s activities on Sunday morning are the subject\r\nof conflicting testimony. George Senator believed that Ruby did not\r\nrise until 9 or 9:30 a.m.;[C6-1068] both Ruby and Senator maintained\r\nthat Ruby did not leave their apartment until shortly before 11:00\r\na.m., and two other witnesses have provided testimony which supports\r\nthat account of Ruby’s whereabouts.[C6-1069] On the other hand, three\r\nWBAP-TV television technicians--Warren Richey, John Smith, and Ira\r\nWalker--believed they saw Ruby near the Police and Courts Building\r\nat various times between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.[C6-1070] But there are\r\nsubstantial reasons to doubt the accuracy of their identifications.\r\nNone had ever seen Ruby on a prior occasion. None looked for an\r\nextended period at the man believed to be Ruby,[C6-1071] and all were\r\noccupied with their duties and had no reason to remember the man’s\r\nappearance until they saw Ruby’s picture on television.[C6-1072]\r\n\r\nSmith, for one, was not entirely positive about his identification\r\nof Ruby as the man he saw;[C6-1073] and Richey was looking down from\r\natop a TV mobile unit when he observed on the sidewalk the man he\r\nbelieved was Ruby.[C6-1074] In addition, Richey and Smith provided\r\ndescriptions of Ruby which differ substantially from information\r\nabout Ruby gathered from other sources. Smith described the man he\r\nsaw as being an “unkempt person that possibly could have slept with\r\nhis clothes on * * *.”[C6-1075] Ruby was characteristically clean and\r\nwell groomed.[C6-1076] In fact, Senator testified that Ruby shaved and\r\ndressed before leaving their apartment that morning, and at the time\r\nRuby shot Oswald he was dressed in a hat and business suit.[C6-1077]\r\nRichey described Ruby as wearing a grayish overcoat,[C6-1078] while\r\ninvestigation indicated that Ruby did not own an overcoat and was\r\nnot wearing one at the time of the shooting.[C6-1079] (See Pappas\r\nDeposition Exhibit No. 1, p. 356.) Although Walker’s identification\r\nof Ruby is the most positive, his certainty must be contrasted with\r\nthe indefinite identification made by Smith, who had seen the man on\r\none additional occasion.[C6-1080] Both Smith and Walker saw a man\r\nresembling Ruby when the man, on two occasions, looked through the\r\nwindow of their mobile news unit and once asked whether Oswald had\r\nbeen transferred. Both saw only the man’s head, and Smith was closer\r\nto the window; yet Smith would not state positively that the man was\r\nRuby.[C6-1081] Finally, video tapes of scenes on Sunday morning near\r\nthe NBC van show a man close to the Commerce Street entrance who might\r\nhave been mistaken for Ruby.[C6-1082]\r\n\r\nGeorge Senator said that when he arose, before 9 a.m., he began to\r\ndo his laundry in the basement of the apartment building while Ruby\r\nslept.[C6-1083] During Senator’s absence, Ruby received a telephone\r\ncall from his cleaning lady, Mrs. Elnora Pitts, who testified that she\r\ncalled sometime between 8:30 and 9 a.m. to learn whether Ruby wanted\r\nher to clean his apartment that day.[C6-1084] Mrs. Pitts remembered\r\nthat Ruby “sounded terrible strange to me.” She said that “there was\r\nsomething wrong with him the way he was talking to me.”[C6-1085] Mrs.\r\nPitts explained that, although she had regularly been cleaning Ruby’s\r\napartment on Sundays, Ruby seemed not to comprehend who she was or\r\nthe reason for her call and required her to repeat herself several\r\ntimes.[C6-1086] As Senator returned to the apartment after the call, he\r\nwas apparently mistaken for Ruby by a neighbor, Sidney Evans, Jr. Evans\r\nhad never seen Ruby before but recalled observing a man resembling\r\nRuby, clad in trousers and T-shirt, walk upstairs from the “washateria”\r\nin the basement of their building and enter Ruby’s suite with a load\r\nof laundry. Later in the morning, Malcolm Slaughter who shared an\r\napartment with Evans, saw an individual, similarly clad, on the same\r\nfloor as Ruby’s apartment.[C6-1087] Senator stated that it was not\r\nRuby’s custom to do his own washing and that Ruby did not do so that\r\nmorning.[C6-1088]\r\n\r\nWhile Senator was in the apartment, Ruby watched television, made\r\nhimself coffee and scrambled eggs, and received, at 10:19 a.m., a\r\ntelephone call from his entertainer, Karen Carlin.[C6-1089] Mrs. Carlin\r\ntestified that in her telephone conversation she asked Ruby for $25\r\ninasmuch as her rent was delinquent and she needed groceries.[C6-1090]\r\nShe said that Ruby, who seemed upset, mentioned that he was going\r\ndowntown anyway and that he would send the money from the Western Union\r\noffice.[C6-1091] According to George Senator, Ruby then probably took a\r\nhalf hour or more to bathe and dress.[C6-1092]\r\n\r\nSupporting the accounts given by Mrs. Carlin and Mrs. Pitts of Ruby’s\r\nemotional state, Senator testified that during the morning Ruby:\r\n\r\n    * * * was even mumbling, which I didn’t understand. And right\r\n    after breakfast he got dressed. Then after he got dressed he\r\n    was pacing the floor from the living room to the bedroom,\r\n    from the bedroom to the living room, and his lips were\r\n    going. What he was jabbering I don’t know. But he was really\r\n    pacing.[C6-1093]\r\n\r\nRuby has described to the Commission his own emotions of Sunday morning\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    * * * Sunday morning * * * [I] saw a letter to Caroline, two\r\n    columns about a 16-inch area. Someone had written a letter to\r\n    Caroline. The most heartbreaking letter. I don’t remember the\r\n    contents. * * * alongside that letter on the same sheet of\r\n    paper was a small comment in the newspaper that, I don’t know\r\n    how it was stated, that Mrs. Kennedy may have to come back for\r\n    the trial of Lee Harvey Oswald. * * *\r\n\r\n    I don’t know what bug got ahold of me. I don’t know what it is,\r\n    but I am going to tell the truth word for word.\r\n\r\n    I am taking a pill called Preludin. It is a harmless pill, and\r\n    it is very easy to get in the drugstore. It isn’t a highly\r\n    prescribed pill. I use it for dieting.\r\n\r\n    I don’t partake of that much food. I think that was a stimulus\r\n    to give me an emotional feeling that suddenly I felt, which was\r\n    so stupid, that I wanted to show my love for our faith, being\r\n    of the Jewish faith, and I never used the term and I don’t want\r\n    to go into that--suddenly the feeling, the emotional feeling\r\n    came within me that someone owed this debt to our beloved\r\n    President to save her the ordeal of coming back. I don’t know\r\n    why that came through my mind.[C6-1094]\r\n\r\n(See Commission Exhibit No. 2426, p. 355.)\r\n\r\n_Sunday morning trip to police department._--Leaving his apartment a\r\nfew minutes before 11 a.m., Ruby went to his automobile taking with him\r\nhis dachshund, Sheba, and a portable radio.[C6-1095] He placed in his\r\npocket a revolver which he routinely carried in a bank moneybag in the\r\ntrunk of his car.[C6-1096] Listening to the radio, he drove downtown,\r\naccording to his own testimony, by a route that took him past Dealey\r\nPlaza where he observed the scattered wreaths. Ruby related that he\r\nnoted the crowd that had gathered outside the county jail and assumed\r\nthat Oswald had already been transferred. However, when he passed the\r\nMain Street side of the Police and Courts Building, which is situated\r\non the same block as the Western Union office, he also noted the crowd\r\nthat was gathered outside that building.[C6-1097] Normal driving time\r\nfor the trip from his apartment would have been about 15 minutes, but\r\nRuby’s possible haste and the slow movement of traffic through Dealey\r\nPlaza make a reliable estimate difficult.[C6-1098]\r\n\r\nRuby parked his car in a lot directly across the street from the\r\nWestern Union office. He apparently placed his keys and billfold in the\r\ntrunk of the car, then locked the trunk, which contained approximately\r\n$1,000 in cash, and placed the trunk key in the glove compartment of\r\nthe car. He did not lock the car doors.[C6-1099]\r\n\r\nWith his revolver, more than $2,000 in cash, and no personal\r\nidentification, Ruby walked from the parking lot across the street to\r\nthe Western Union office where he filled out forms for sending $25 by\r\ntelegraph to Karen Carlin.[C6-1100] After waiting in line while one\r\nother Western Union customer completed her business,[C6-1101] Ruby paid\r\nfor the telegram and retained as a receipt one of three time-stamped\r\ndocuments which show that the transaction was completed at almost\r\nexactly 11:17 a.m., c.s.t.[C6-1102] (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 1476,\r\n2420, 2421; D. Lane Deposition Exhibits Nos. 5118, 5119, p. 351.)\r\nThe Western Union clerk who accepted Ruby’s order recalls that Ruby\r\npromptly turned, walked out of the door onto Main Street, and proceeded\r\nin the direction of the police department one block away.[C6-1103]\r\nThe evidence set forth in chapter V indicates that Ruby entered the\r\npolice basement through the auto ramp from Main Street and stood\r\nbehind the front rank of newsmen and police officers who were crowded\r\ntogether at the base of the ramp awaiting the transfer of Oswald to\r\nthe county jail.[C6-1104] As Oswald emerged from a basement office\r\nat approximately 11:21 a.m., Ruby moved quickly forward and, without\r\nspeaking,[C6-1105] fired one fatal shot into Oswald’s abdomen before\r\nbeing subdued by a rush of police officers.[C6-1106]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEDROOM OF JACK RUBY’S APARTMENT\r\n\r\n(COMMISSION EXHIBIT 2426)\r\n\r\nON SUNDAY AFTERNOON NOVEMBER 24, 1963, A COPY OF THAT MORNING’S DALLAS\r\nTIMES HERALD WAS FOUND AT THE FOOT OF JACK RUBY’S BED (B).

Prior to the tragedy, Ruby’s activities were\r\nroutine. Though persons who saw him between November 22 and 24 disagree\r\nas to whether or not he appeared more upset than others around him, his\r\nresponse to the assassination appears to have been one of genuine shock\r\nand grief. His indications of concern over the possible effects of the\r\nassassination upon his businesses seem consistent with other evidence\r\nof his character.[C6-1107] During the course of the weekend, Ruby seems\r\nto have become obsessed with the possibility that the Impeach Earl\r\nWarren sign and the Bernard Weissman ad were somehow connected and\r\nrelated to the assassination. However, Ruby’s interest in these public\r\nnotices was openly expressed and, as discussed below, the evidence\r\nreveals no connection between him and any political organization.\r\n\r\nExamination of Larry Crafard’s sudden departure from Dallas shortly\r\nbefore noon on November 23 does not suggest that Ruby was involved in a\r\nconspiracy. To be sure, Crafard started hitchhiking to Michigan, where\r\nmembers of his family lived, with only $7 in his pocket.[C6-1108] He\r\nmade no attempt to communicate with law enforcement officials after\r\nOswald’s death;[C6-1109] and a relative in Michigan recalled that\r\nCrafard spoke very little of his association with Ruby.[C6-1110] When\r\nfinally located by the FBI 6 days later, he stated that he left Ruby’s\r\nemploy because he did not wish to be subjected to further verbal abuse\r\nby Ruby and that he went north to see his sister, from whom he had not\r\nheard in some time.[C6-1111]\r\n\r\nAn investigation of Crafard’s unusual behavior confirms that his\r\ndeparture from Dallas was innocent. After Oswald was shot, FBI\r\nagents obtained from the Carousel Club an unmailed letter drafted\r\nby Crafard to a relative in Michigan at least a week before the\r\nassassination.[C6-1112] The letter revealed that he was considering\r\nleaving Dallas at that time.[C6-1113] On November 17, Crafard, who had\r\nbeen receiving only room, board, and incidental expenses, told Ruby he\r\nwanted to stop working for him; however, Crafard agreed to remain when\r\nRuby promised a salary.[C6-1114] Then on the morning of November 23,\r\nRuby and Crafard had a minor altercation over the telephone.[C6-1115]\r\nAlthough Crafard did not voluntarily make known to the authorities his\r\nassociations with Ruby, he spoke freely and with verifiable accuracy\r\nwhen questioned. The automobile driver who provided Crafard his first\r\nride from Dallas has been located; his statement generally conforms\r\nwith Crafard’s story; and he did not recall any unusual or troubled\r\nbehavior by Crafard during that ride.[C6-1116]\r\n\r\nAlthough Crafard’s peremptory decision to leave Dallas might be unusual\r\nfor most persons, such behavior does not appear to have been uncommon\r\nfor him. His family residence had shifted frequently among California,\r\nMichigan, and Oregon.[C6-1117] During his 22 years, he had earned his\r\nlivelihood picking crops, working in carnivals, and taking other odd\r\njobs throughout the country.[C6-1118] According to his testimony, he\r\nhad previously hitchhiked across the country with his then wife and\r\ntwo infant children.[C6-1119] Against such a background, it is most\r\nprobable that the factors motivating Crafard’s departure from Dallas on\r\nNovember 23 were dissatisfaction with his existence in Ruby’s employ,\r\nwhich he had never considered more than temporary, Ruby’s decision\r\nto close his clubs for 3 days, the argument on Saturday morning,\r\nand his own desire to see his relatives in Michigan. There is no\r\nevidence to suggest any connection between Crafard’s departure and the\r\nassassination of the President or the shooting of Oswald.\r\n\r\nThe allegations of Wanda Helmick raised speculation that Ruby’s\r\nSaturday night phone calls to Ralph Paul and Breck Wall might have\r\nconcerned the shooting of Oswald, but investigation has found nothing\r\nto indicate that the calls had conspiratorial implications. Paul\r\nwas a close friend, business associate, and adviser to Jack Ruby.\r\nRuby normally kept in close telephone contact with Paul, who had a\r\nsubstantial sum of money committed to the Carousel Club.[C6-1120] Paul\r\nexplained that Ruby called him Saturday evening once to point out his\r\nads, another time to say that nobody seemed to be doing any business in\r\ndowntown Dallas, and a third time to relate that both he and his sister\r\nwere crying over the assassination.[C6-1121] Between two of those phone\r\ncalls to Paul, Ruby telephoned to Galveston, Tex., to speak with Wall,\r\na friend and former business associate who was an official of the\r\nAmerican Guild of Variety Artists. Wall related that during that call\r\nRuby criticized the Weinsteins for failing to close their clubs.\r\n\r\nHaving earlier made the same complaint to Lawrence Meyers to whom\r\nhe mentioned a need “to do something about this” it would have been\r\ncharacteristic for Ruby to want to direct Breck Wall’s attention,\r\nas an AGVA official, to what he regarded as the Weinsteins’ improper\r\nconduct. The view that the calls to Wall and Paul could have had\r\nconspiratorial implications also is belied in large measure by the\r\nconduct of both men before and after the events of November 22-24. A\r\ncheck of long-distance telephone records reveals no suspicious activity\r\nby either man.[C6-1122] Paul, in fact, is not known to have visited\r\nDallas during the weekend of the assassination except to appear openly\r\nin an effort to arrange counsel for Ruby within a few hours of the\r\nattack on Oswald. Neither the FBI nor the CIA has been able to provide\r\nany information that Ralph Paul or Breck Wall ever engaged in any form\r\nof subversive activity.[C6-1123]\r\n\r\nMoreover, Mrs. Helmick’s reliability is undermined by her failure to\r\nreport her information to any investigative official until June 9,\r\n1964.[C6-1124] Although a sister-in-law confirms that Mrs. Helmick\r\nwrote her “something about a gun” shortly after the shooting,[C6-1125]\r\nthe only mention of any statement by Paul which was included in a\r\nletter written by Mrs. Helmick after the Ruby trial was that Paul\r\nbelieved Ruby was “not in his right mind.”[C6-1126] No corroborating\r\nwitness named by Mrs. Helmick has been found who remembers the\r\nconversations she mentioned.[C6-1127] Both Ruby and Paul have denied\r\nthat anything was said, as Mrs. Helmick suggests, about a gun or an\r\nintent to shoot Oswald, and Wall has stated that Ruby did not discuss\r\nsuch matters with him.[C6-1128] Even if Mrs. Helmick is accurate the\r\nstatements ascribed to Paul indicate only that he may have heard of a\r\npossible reference by Ruby to shooting Oswald. According to her, Paul’s\r\nresponse was to exclaim “Are you crazy?” But under no circumstances\r\ndoes the report of Mrs. Helmick or any other fact support a belief that\r\nPaul or Wall was involved in the shooting of Oswald.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has conducted an investigation of the telephone call\r\nRuby received from Karen Carlin at 10:19 Sunday morning to determine\r\nwhether that call was prearranged for the purpose of conveying\r\ninformation about the transfer of Oswald or to provide Ruby an excuse\r\nfor being near the police department. The Commission has examined the\r\nrecords of long-distance telephone calls on Sunday morning for Jack\r\nRuby,[C6-1129] the Carlins,[C6-1130] the Dallas police,[C6-1131] and\r\nseveral other persons[C6-1132] and has found no sign of any indirect\r\ncommunication to Ruby through Mr. or Mrs. Carlin. No other evidence\r\nshowing any link between the Carlins and the shooting of Oswald has\r\nbeen developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nRuby and Oswald Were Not Acquainted\r\n\r\nThe possibility of a prior acquaintanceship between Ruby and Oswald has\r\nbeen suggested by some persons who viewed the shooting on television\r\nand believed that a look of recognition appeared on Oswald’s face as\r\nRuby moved toward him in the jail basement. The Commission has examined\r\nthe television tapes and movie films which were made as Oswald moved\r\nthrough the basement and has observed no facial expressions which can\r\nbe interpreted as signifying recognition of Ruby by Oswald. It is\r\ndoubtful even that Oswald could have seen Ruby sufficiently clearly to\r\ndiscern his identity since Oswald was walking from a dark corridor into\r\n“the flash from the many cameras” and the lights of TV cameramen which\r\nwere “blinding.”[C6-1133] In addition to such generalized suspicion,\r\nthere have been numerous specific allegations that Oswald was seen in\r\nthe company of Ruby prior to November 22, often at Ruby’s Carousel\r\nClub. All such allegations have been investigated, but the Commission\r\nhas found none which merits credence. In all but a few instances where\r\nthe Commission was able to trace the claim to its source, the person\r\nresponsible for the report either denied making it or admitted that he\r\nhad no basis for the original allegations.[C6-1134] Frequently those\r\nresponsible for the allegations have proved to be persons of erratic\r\nmemory or dubious mental stability.[C6-1135] In a few instances, the\r\nsource of the story has remained unidentified, and no person has come\r\nforward to substantiate the rumor.[C6-1136]\r\n\r\nThe testimony of a few witnesses who claim to have seen Ruby with a\r\nperson who they feel may have been Oswald warrants further comment. One\r\nsuch witness, Robert K. Patterson, a Dallas electronics salesman, has\r\nstated that on a date established from sales records as November 1,\r\n1963, Ruby, accompanied by a man who resembled Oswald, purchased some\r\nequipment at his business establishment.[C6-1137] However, Patterson\r\ndid not claim positively that the man he saw was Oswald,[C6-1138] and\r\ntwo of his associates who were also present at the time could not state\r\nthat the man was Oswald.[C6-1139] Other evidence indicates that Ruby’s\r\ncompanion was Larry Crafard. Crafard, who lived at the Carousel Club\r\nwhile working for Ruby from mid-October until November 23, 1963, stated\r\nthat sometime in late October or early November he accompanied Ruby to\r\nan electronics store in connection with the purchase of electronics\r\nequipment.[C6-1140] Ruth Paine testified that Crafard’s photograph\r\nbears a strong resemblance to Oswald; and employment records of the\r\nTexas School Book Depository show that Oswald worked a full day on\r\nNovember 1, 1963.[C6-1141]\r\n\r\nWilliam D. Crowe, Jr., a young nightclub master of ceremonies\r\nwho had worked for Ruby on three occasions and had begun a 4- or\r\n5-week engagement at the Carousel Club on November 11, 1963, was\r\nthe first person who reported a possible association between Ruby\r\nand Oswald.[C6-1142] While attempting to enter the Carousel Club on\r\nNovember 24, shortly after Oswald was shot, Crowe encountered two\r\nnews media representatives who were gathering information on Jack\r\nRuby.[C6-1143] At that time, Crowe, who included a memory act in\r\nhis repertoire,[C6-1144] mentioned the “possibility” that he had\r\nseen Oswald at the Carousel Club.[C6-1145] As a result he was asked\r\nto appear on television. In Crowe’s own words, the story “started\r\nsnowballing.” He testified:\r\n\r\n    They built up the memory thing and they built up the bit of\r\n    having seen Oswald there, and I never stated definitely,\r\n    positively, and they said that I did, and all in all, what\r\n    they had in the paper was hardly even close to what I told\r\n    them.[C6-1146]\r\n\r\nCrowe added that his memory act involved a limited system which did\r\nnot, in fact, improve his memory and that his memory might not even be\r\nas good as that of the average person. When asked how certain he was\r\nthat the man he saw was Oswald, Crowe testified: “* * * the face seemed\r\nfamiliar as some faces do, and I had associated him with a patron that\r\nI had seen in the club a week before. That was about it.”[C6-1147]\r\n\r\nA possible explanation for Crowe’s belief that Oswald’s face seemed\r\nfamiliar was supplied by a freelance photographer, Eddie Rocco, who\r\nhad taken pictures at the Carousel Club for Ruby at about the time\r\nCrowe was employed there. Rocco produced one of those photographs\r\nwhich depicted a man who might have been mistaken for Oswald by\r\npersons having no reason to remember the man at the time they saw\r\nhim.[C6-1148] When shown the Rocco photograph, Crowe said that there\r\nwas as strong a possibility that the man he recalled seeing was the man\r\nin the photograph as there was that he was Oswald.[C6-1149] Crowe’s\r\nuncertainty was further underscored by his failure initially to provide\r\nhis information about Oswald to David Hoy, a news-media friend whom\r\nCrowe telephoned in Evansville, Ind., less than 20 minutes after Oswald\r\nwas shot.[C6-1150] By then the possible recognition had occurred to\r\nCrowe,[C6-1151] and Hoy said he was quite surprised that Crowe had\r\ngiven the information first to other news representatives instead of\r\ntelling him in that early conversation.[C6-1152]\r\n\r\nAfter Crowe’s identification had been publicized, four other persons\r\nalso reported seeing Oswald at the Carousel Club. One man said he\r\nsaw Ruby and Oswald seated at a table together and recalled that the\r\nman resembling Oswald was addressed by a blond-haired waitress as\r\n“Bettit” or “Pettit.” The witness was unable to give any description\r\nof “Pettit” except that he was the man who had been shot by Ruby. He\r\ncould not describe the inside of the Carousel and was unable to give\r\na precise location for the club.[C6-1153] Another witness, a resident\r\nof Tennessee, related seeing a man resembling Oswald at the Carousel\r\nClub on November 10.[C6-1154] Ruth Paine has testified, however, that\r\nOswald spent the entire holiday weekend of November 9, 10, and 11 at\r\nher home in Irving, Tex.[C6-1155] Two of Ruby’s former employees, Karen\r\nCarlin and Billy Joe Willis, also believed they had seen a person who\r\nresembled Oswald. Willis believed he saw the man at the Carousel Club\r\nbut did not think the man was Oswald.[C6-1156] Mrs. Carlin likewise was\r\nnot certain that the man was Oswald nor was she sure where she had seen\r\nhim.[C6-1157] Neither reported any connection between the man and Ruby.\r\nNo other employees recalled seeing Oswald or a person resembling him at\r\nthe Carousel Club.[C6-1158]\r\n\r\nWilbryn Waldon (Robert) Litchfield II also claimed to have seen at\r\nthe Carousel Club a man resembling Oswald. Litchfield stated that\r\nduring a visit to the Carousel Club in late October or early November\r\n1963, he saw such a man enter Ruby’s office, apparently to confer with\r\nRuby.[C6-1159] Although there is substantial evidence that Litchfield\r\ndid see Ruby at the Carousel Club about that time,[C6-1160] there\r\nis strong reason to believe that Litchfield did not see Lee Harvey\r\nOswald. Litchfield described the man he saw as having pockmarks\r\non the right side of his chin;[C6-1161] Oswald did not have such\r\nidentifying marks.[C6-1162] Moreover, the Commission has substantial\r\ndoubts concerning Litchfield’s credibility. Although present at an\r\nFBI interview of another witness on November 29, Litchfield made no\r\nmention of his observation to public officials until December 2,\r\n1963.[C6-1163] Litchfield, who had twice been convicted for offenses\r\ninvolving forged checks,[C6-1164] testified that he first recalled\r\nthat Oswald resembled the visitor he saw at the Carousel Club while\r\nwatching a television showing on Sunday morning, November 24, of the\r\nshooting by Ruby.[C6-1165] At that time Litchfield was playing poker\r\nwith three friends, and he testified that he promptly informed them of\r\nthe resemblance he observed.[C6-1166] However, none of the three poker\r\ncompanions remembered Litchfield’s making such a remark; and two added\r\nthat Litchfield’s statements were often untrustworthy.[C6-1167]\r\n\r\nWith regard to all of the persons who claimed to have seen Ruby and\r\nOswald together, it is significant that none had particular reason to\r\npay close attention to either man, that substantial periods of time\r\nelapsed before the events they assertedly witnessed became meaningful,\r\nand that, unlike the eyewitnesses who claimed to have seen Oswald\r\non November 22, none reported their observations soon after Oswald\r\nwas arrested. In the course of its investigation, the Commission has\r\nencountered numerous clear mistakes of identification. For example, at\r\nleast four persons, other than Crafard, are known to have been mistaken\r\nfor Oswald.[C6-1168] Other persons have been misidentified as Jack\r\nRuby.[C6-1169] Under all the available evidence there is no substantial\r\nlikelihood that the person the various witnesses claimed to have seen\r\nwith Ruby was in fact Oswald.\r\n\r\nIn addition to probing the reported evidence that Ruby and Oswald had\r\nbeen seen together, the Commission has examined other circumstances for\r\nsigns that the two men were acquainted. From the time Oswald returned\r\nfrom Mexico, both he and Jack Ruby lived in the Oak Cliff section of\r\nDallas, slightly more than a mile apart. Numerous neighbors of both\r\nOswald and Ruby were interviewed, and none knew of any association\r\nbetween the two.[C6-1170] Oswald’s work began at 8 each weekday\r\nmorning and terminated at 4:45 each afternoon.[C6-1171] Jack Ruby\r\nusually remained in his apartment until past 9 a.m. each day.[C6-1172]\r\nAlthough both men worked in downtown Dallas, they normally traveled\r\nto their places of employment by different routes. Ruby owned an\r\nautomobile, and the shortest route downtown from his home was via\r\na freeway adjacent to his apartment.[C6-1173] Oswald did not own a\r\ncar and had, at best, a rudimentary ability to drive.[C6-1174] From\r\nhis roominghouses on North Beckley Avenue and on Marsalis Street, he\r\nnormally took public transportation which did not bring him within six\r\nblocks of either Ruby’s apartment or his downtown nightclub, nor did\r\nOswald’s route from the bus stop to home or work bring him near Ruby’s\r\nhome or business.[C6-1175] Persons at Oswald’s roominghouse testified\r\nthat he regularly came home promptly after work and remained in his\r\nroom.[C6-1176] While in Dallas, he is not known to have visited any\r\nnightclub.[C6-1177] Ruby was generally at the Carousel Club from 9\r\no’clock each evening until after 1 a.m.[C6-1178] In a few instances,\r\nRuby and Oswald patronized the same stores, but no indication has\r\nbeen found that they ever met at such stores.[C6-1179] Ruby at one\r\ntime frequented a restaurant where Oswald occasionally ate breakfast,\r\nbut the times of their patronage were widely separated and restaurant\r\nemployees knew of no acquaintance between Ruby and Oswald.[C6-1180]\r\nLikewise, Ruby has held various memberships in the Dallas YMCA and\r\nOswald lived there for brief periods; however, there is no indication\r\nthat they were there at the same time.[C6-1181]\r\n\r\nBoth Ruby and Oswald maintained post office boxes at the terminal annex\r\nof the U.S. post office in Dallas, but there is no indication that\r\nthose facts were more than coincidental. On November 1, 1963, Oswald\r\nrented box No. 6225, his third since October 1962.[C6-1182] Oswald’s\r\npossible purpose has been discussed previously in this chapter. On\r\nNovember 7, 1963, Jack Ruby rented post office box No. 5475 because he\r\nhoped to receive mail responses to advertisements for the twistboard\r\nexercise device which he was then promoting.[C6-1183] Although it is\r\nconceivable that Oswald and Ruby coincidentally encountered one another\r\nwhile checking their boxes, the different daily schedules of the two\r\nmen render even this possibility unlikely. Moreover, Oswald’s withdrawn\r\npersonality makes it improbable that the two would have spoken if their\r\npaths had crossed.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has also examined the known friends and acquaintances of\r\nRuby and Oswald for evidence that the two were acquainted, but it has\r\nfound very few possible links. One conceivable association was through\r\nJohn Carter, a boarder at 1026 North Beckley Avenue while Oswald lived\r\nthere. Carter was friendly with Wanda Joyce Killam, who had known Jack\r\nRuby since shortly after he moved to Dallas in 1947 and worked for him\r\nfrom July 1963 to early November 1963. Mrs. Killam, who volunteered the\r\ninformation about Carter’s residence during an interview with an agent\r\nof the FBI, has stated that she did not believe Carter ever visited the\r\nCarousel Club and that she did not think Carter knew Ruby.[C6-1184]\r\nCarter stated that he had not heard of Ruby until Oswald was shot, had\r\ntalked briefly with Oswald only once or twice, and had never heard\r\nOswald mention Ruby or the Carousel Club.[C6-1185] The Commission has\r\nno reason to disbelieve either Mrs. Killam or Mr. Carter.\r\n\r\nA second possible link between Oswald and Ruby was through Earlene\r\nRoberts, the housekeeper at 1026 North Beckley Avenue. Bertha Cheek,\r\nthe sister of Mrs. Roberts, is known to have visited Jack Ruby at\r\nthe Carousel Club during the afternoon of November 18, 1963. Mrs.\r\nCheek testified that she had met with Ruby and a person whom Ruby\r\nrepresented to be an interior decorator for the purpose of discussing\r\nthe possibility of financially backing Ruby in a new nightclub which\r\nhe planned to open. Mrs. Cheek said she had met Ruby only once, a\r\nfew years before, and that she had not heard of Oswald until he shot\r\nPresident Kennedy.[C6-1186] Mr. Frank Boerder, the decorator who\r\nwas present at the November 18 meeting, confirmed the substance of\r\nthe discussion reported by Mrs. Cheek,[C6-1187] and other witnesses\r\nestablish that Ruby was, in fact, seeking an associate for a new\r\nnightclub venture.[C6-1188] There is no evidence that Jack Ruby ever\r\nassociated with Earlene Roberts, nor is there any indication that Mrs.\r\nCheek knew of Lee Harvey Oswald prior to November 22.[C6-1189]\r\n\r\nOswald’s trips to the home of Mrs. Ruth Paine at 2115 West Fifth\r\nStreet in Irving, Tex., presented another possible link to Ruby.\r\nWhile Oswald’s family resided with Mrs. Paine, William F. Simmons,\r\npianoplayer in the musical combo which worked at the Carousel Club\r\nfrom September 17, 1963, until November 21, 1963, lived at 2539 West\r\nFifth Street, in Irving. Simmons has stated that his only relationship\r\nto Ruby was as an employee, that Ruby never visited him, that he did\r\nnot know Oswald, and that he had never seen Oswald at the Carousel\r\nClub.[C6-1190] Other persons in the neighborhood knew of no connection\r\nbetween Ruby and Oswald.[C6-1191]\r\n\r\nThe Commission has investigated rumors that Jack Ruby and Lee Harvey\r\nOswald were both homosexuals and, thus, might have known each other\r\nin that respect. However, no evidence has been uncovered to support\r\nthe rumors, the closest acquaintances of both men emphatically deny\r\nthem,[C6-1192] and Ruby’s nightclubs were not known to have been\r\nfrequented by homosexuals.[C6-1193]\r\n\r\nA final suggestion of a connection between Jack Ruby and Lee Harvey\r\nOswald arises from the testimony of Oswald’s mother, Marguerite\r\nOswald. When appearing before the Commission, Mrs. Oswald related that\r\non November 23, 1963, before Ruby shot Oswald, FBI Agent Bardwell\r\nD. Odum showed her a picture of a man she believed was Jack Ruby,\r\nand asked whether the man shown was familiar to her. Odum had first\r\nattempted to see Marina Oswald, but Marguerite refused to allow Marina\r\nto be disturbed at that time.[C6-1194] In the course of Marguerite’s\r\ntestimony, the Commission asked the FBI for a copy of the photograph\r\ndisplayed by Odum to her. When Marguerite viewed the photograph\r\nprovided the Commission, she stated that the picture was different from\r\nthe one she saw in November, in part because the “top two corners” were\r\ncut differently and because the man depicted was not Jack Ruby.[C6-1195]\r\n\r\nThe Commission has investigated this matter and determined that Special\r\nAgent Odum did show a picture to Marguerite Oswald for possible\r\nidentification but that the picture was not of Jack Ruby. On November\r\n22 the CIA had provided the FBI with a photograph of a man who, it was\r\nthought at the time, might have been associated with Oswald. To prevent\r\nthe viewer from determining precisely where the picture had been\r\ntaken, FBI Agent Odum had trimmed the background from the photograph\r\nby making a series of straight cuts which reduced the picture to an\r\nirregular hexagonal shape.[C6-1196] The picture which was displayed\r\nby the Commission to Marguerite Oswald was a copy of the same picture\r\nshown her by Agent Odum; however, in supplying a duplicate photograph\r\nfor Commission use the FBI had cropped the background by cutting\r\nalong the contours of the body of the man shown,[C6-1197] resulting\r\nin a photograph without any background, unlike the first photograph\r\nMarguerite viewed on November 23. Affidavits obtained from the CIA and\r\nfrom the two FBI agents who trimmed the photographs established that\r\nthe one shown to Mrs. Oswald before the Commission, though trimmed\r\ndifferently from the one shown her on November 23, was a copy of the\r\nsame picture. Neither picture was of Jack Ruby.[C6-1198] The original\r\nphotograph had been taken by the CIA outside of the United States\r\nsometime between July 1, 1963, and November 22, 1963, during all of\r\nwhich time Ruby was within the country.[C6-1199]\r\n\r\n\r\nRuby’s Background and Associations\r\n\r\nIn addition to examining in detail Jack Ruby’s activities from November\r\n21 to November 24 and his possible acquaintanceship with Lee Harvey\r\nOswald, the Commission has considered whether or not Ruby had ties\r\nwith individuals or groups that might have obviated the need for any\r\ndirect contact near the time of the assassination. Study of Jack Ruby’s\r\nbackground, which is set out more fully in appendix XVI, leads to the\r\nfirm conclusion that he had no such ties.\r\n\r\n_Business activities._--Ruby’s entire life is characteristic of a\r\nrigorously independent person. He moved from his family home soon after\r\nleaving high school at age 16, although a “family” residence has been\r\nmaintained in Chicago throughout the years.[C6-1200] Later, in 1947,\r\nhe moved from Chicago to Dallas and maintained only sporadic contact\r\nwith most of his family.[C6-1201] For most of his working years and\r\ncontinuously since 1947, Jack Ruby was self-employed.[C6-1202] Although\r\nhe had partners from time to time, the partnerships were not lasting,\r\nand Ruby seems to have preferred to operate independently.\r\n\r\nRuby’s main sources of income were his two nightclubs--the Carousel\r\nClub and the Vegas Club--although he also frequently pursued a number\r\nof independent, short-lived business promotions. (Ruby’s business\r\ndealings are described in greater detail in app. XVI.) At the time of\r\nthe assassination, the United States claimed approximately $44,000\r\nin delinquent taxes, and he was in substantial debt to his brother\r\nEarl and to his friend Ralph Paul.[C6-1203] However, there are no\r\nindications that Earl Ruby or Ralph Paul was exerting pressure for\r\npayment or that Ruby’s tax liabilities were not susceptible to an\r\nacceptable settlement. Ruby operated his clubs on a cash basis,\r\nusually carrying large amounts of cash on his person; thus there is\r\nno particular significance to the fact that approximately $3,000 in\r\ncash was found on his person and in his automobile when arrested. Nor\r\ndo his meager financial records reflect any suspicious activities.\r\nHe used his bank accounts only infrequently, with no unexplained\r\nlarge transactions; and no entries were made to Ruby’s safe-deposit\r\nboxes in over a year prior to the shooting of Oswald.[C6-1204] There\r\nis no evidence that Ruby received any sums after his arrest except\r\nroyalties from a syndicated newspaper article on his life and small\r\ncontributions for his defense from friends, sympathizers, and family\r\nmembers.[C6-1205]\r\n\r\n_Ruby’s political activities._--Jack Ruby considered himself a\r\nDemocrat, perhaps in part because his brother Hyman had been active\r\nin Democratic ward politics in Chicago.[C6-1206] When Ruby was\r\narrested, police officers found in his apartment, 10 political cards\r\nurging the election of the “Conservative Democratic slate,”[C6-1207]\r\nbut the Commission has found no evidence that Ruby had distributed\r\nthat literature and he is not known ever to have campaigned for any\r\npolitical candidates.[C6-1208] None of his friends or associates\r\nexpressed any knowledge that he belonged to any groups interested in\r\npolitical issues, nor did they remember that he had discussed political\r\nproblems except on rare occasions.[C6-1209]\r\n\r\nAs a young man, Ruby participated in attacks upon meetings of the\r\nGerman-American Bund in Chicago, but the assaults were the efforts\r\nof poolhall associates from his predominantly Jewish neighborhood\r\nrather than the work of any political group. His only other known\r\nactivities which had any political flavor possessed stronger overtones\r\nof financial self-interest. In early 1942 he registered a copyright for\r\na placard which displayed an American flag and bore the inscription\r\n“Remember Pearl Harbor.” The placard was never successfully promoted.\r\nAt other times, he is reported to have attempted to sell busts\r\nof President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[C6-1210] The rabbi of Ruby’s\r\nsynagogue expressed the belief that Ruby was too unsophisticated to\r\ngrasp or have a significant interest in any political creed.[C6-1211]\r\nAlthough various views have been given concerning Ruby’s attitude\r\ntoward President Kennedy prior to the assassination, the overwhelming\r\nnumber of witnesses reported that Ruby had considerable respect for\r\nthe President, and there has been no report of any hostility toward\r\nhim.[C6-1212]\r\n\r\nThere is also no reliable indication that Ruby was ever associated\r\nwith any Communist or radical causes. Jack Ruby’s parents were born in\r\nPoland in the 1870’s and his father served in the Czarist Russian army\r\nfrom 1893-98. Though neither parent became a citizen after emigrating\r\nto the United States in the early 1900’s, the evidence indicates\r\nthat neither Ruby nor his family maintained any ties with relatives\r\nin Europe.[C6-1213] Jack Ruby has denied ever being connected with\r\nany Communist activities. The FBI has reported that, prior to the\r\nshooting of Oswald, its nationwide files contained no information of\r\nany subversive activities by Ruby.[C6-1214] In addition, a Commission\r\nstaff member has personally examined all subversive activities reports\r\nfrom the Dallas-Fort Worth office of the FBI for the year 1963 and\r\nhas found no reports pertaining to Jack Ruby or any of his known\r\nacquaintances.[C6-1215]\r\n\r\nThe Commission has directed considerable attention to an allegation\r\nthat Jack Ruby was connected with Communist Party activities in Muncie,\r\nInd. On the day after Oswald’s death, a former resident of Muncie\r\nclaimed that between 1943 and 1947 a Chicagoan resembling Ruby and\r\nknown to him as Jack Rubenstein was in Muncie on three occasions and\r\nassociated with persons who the witness suspected were Communists.\r\nThe witness stated that the man resembling Ruby visited Muncie during\r\nthese years as a guest of the son-in-law of a now-deceased jeweler for\r\nwhom the witness worked.[C6-1216] A second son-in-law of the jewelry\r\nstore owner suggested that he may have known Ruby while the two resided\r\nin Chicago,[C6-1217] but the son-in-law whom Ruby allegedly visited\r\ndisclaimed any acquaintanceship with Ruby.[C6-1218] Both sons-in-law\r\ndenied any Communist activities and the Commission has found no\r\ncontrary evidence other than the testimony of the witness.\r\n\r\nOn the first two occasions on which Ruby is alleged to have been in\r\nMuncie, military records show him to have been on active military\r\nduty in the South.[C6-1219] The witness also said that the man he\r\nknew as Rubenstein owned or managed a nightclub when he met him, but\r\nthe Commission has no reliable evidence that Jack Ruby ever owned\r\nor worked in any nightclubs when he lived in Chicago.[C6-1220] The\r\nwitness further stated that on one occasion he found the name of\r\nJack Rubenstein, or perhaps a similar name, together with the names\r\nof others he believed were Communists, on a list which had been left\r\nin a room above the jewelry store after a meeting held there. The\r\nwitness said he gave the list to his wife’s cousin, now deceased,\r\nwho was then the chief of detectives in Muncie.[C6-1221] However,\r\nneither the list nor a person identifiable as Jack Ruby has been\r\nlocated after a thorough search by the FBI of its own files and\r\nthose of the Muncie Police Department, the Indiana State Police,\r\nand other agencies.[C6-1222] The witness did not recall seeing\r\nRubenstein in Muncie during the period of that meeting, and he had\r\nnever heard Rubenstein say anything which would indicate he was a\r\nCommunist.[C6-1223]\r\n\r\nThe FBI has interviewed all living persons who the witness stated\r\nwere involved with Ruby in Communist activities in Muncie. One person\r\nnamed by the witness was known previously to have been involved in\r\nCommunist Party activities, but subversive activities files have\r\nrevealed no such activities for any of the others.[C6-1224] The\r\nadmitted former Communist denied knowing Ruby and stated that the\r\njewelry store owner was not known to him as a Communist and that\r\nCommunist meetings were never held above the store.[C6-1225] All\r\nother Muncie residents named by the witness as possible associates of\r\nRuby denied knowing Ruby.[C6-1226] Similarly, fellow employees of the\r\nwitness whom he did not claim were Communists knew of no Communist\r\nactivities connected with the jewelry store owner or any visits of\r\nJack Ruby, and FBI informants familiar with Communist activities in\r\nIndiana and Chicago did not know of any participation by Ruby.[C6-1227]\r\nFinally, the witness testified that even though he believed as early\r\nas 1947 that all of the persons named by him were Communists he had\r\nnever brought his information to the attention of any authority\r\ninvestigating such activities, except for providing the alleged list to\r\nhis cousin.[C6-1228] The Commission finds no basis for accepting the\r\nwitness’s testimony.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has also investigated the possibility that Ruby was\r\nassociated with ultraconservative political endeavors in Dallas. Upon\r\nhis arrest, there were found in Ruby’s possession two radio scripts\r\nof a right-wing program promoted by H. L. Hunt, whose political\r\nviews are highly conservative. Ruby had acquired the scripts a few\r\nweeks earlier at the Texas Products Show, where they were enclosed\r\nin bags of Hunt food products. Ruby is reported to have become\r\nenraged when he discovered the scripts, and threatened to send one to\r\n“Kennedy.”[C6-1229] He is not known to have done anything with them\r\nprior to giving one to a radio announcer on Nevember 23; and on that\r\nday he seemed to confuse organizations of the extreme right with those\r\nof the far left.[C6-1230] On November 21, Ruby drove Connie Trammel,\r\na young college graduate whom he had met some months previously, to\r\nthe office of Lamar Hunt, the son of H. L. Hunt, for a job interview.\r\nAlthough Ruby stated that he would like to meet Hunt, seemingly to\r\nestablish a business connection, he did not enter Hunt’s office with\r\nher.[C6-1231]\r\n\r\nAn allegation that Ruby was a visitor at the home of Maj. Gen. Edwin A.\r\nWalker (Resigned, U.S. Army) appears totally unfounded. The allegation\r\nwas made in late May 1964 to an agent of the U.S. Secret Service by\r\nWilliam McEwan Duff. Duff, who was discharged from military service\r\nin June 1964 because of a fraudulent enlistment, disclaimed any\r\nknowledge of Ruby or Oswald when questioned by FBI agents in January\r\n1964.[C6-1232]\r\n\r\nAnother allegation connecting Jack Ruby with right-wing activities was\r\nMark Lane’s assertion, mentioned previously, that an unnamed informant\r\ntold him of a meeting lasting more than 2 hours in the Carousel Club\r\non November 14, 1963, between Jack Ruby, Patrolman J. D. Tippit, and\r\nBernard Weissman.[C6-1233] Although the name of Lane’s informant has\r\nnever been revealed to the Commission, an investigation has been\r\nconducted in an effort to find corroboration for the claimed Tippit,\r\nWeissman, and Ruby meeting. No employee of the Carousel Club has any\r\nknowledge of the meeting described by Lane.[C6-1234] Ruby and Weissman\r\nboth deny that such a meeting occurred, and Officer Tippit’s widow\r\nhas no knowledge that her late husband ever went to the Carousel\r\nClub.[C6-1235]\r\n\r\nSome confusion has arisen, however, because early Friday afternoon,\r\nNovember 22, Ruby remarked that he knew the Tippit who had been\r\nshot by Oswald. Later Ruby stated that he did not know J. D. Tippit\r\nbut that his reference was to G. M. Tippit, a member of the special\r\nservices bureau of the Dallas Police Department who had visited\r\nRuby establishments occasionally in the course of his official\r\nduties.[C6-1236] Larry Crafard was unable to recognize photographs of\r\nJ. D. Tippit and had no recollection of a Tippit, Weissman, and Ruby\r\nmeeting at any time.[C6-1237] However, uncertainty was introduced when\r\nCrafard identified a photograph of Bernard Weissman as resembling a\r\nman who had visited the Carousel Club and had been referred to by Ruby\r\nas “Weissman.”[C6-1238] In a subsequent interview Crafard stated that\r\nhe believed Weissman was a detective on the Dallas Police Department,\r\nthat his first name may have been Johnny, and that he was in his late\r\nthirties or early forties.[C6-1239] As set forth previously, Bernard\r\nWeissman was a 26-year-old New York carpet salesman. Crafard added\r\n“I could have my recollection of a Mr. Weissman mixed up with someone\r\nelse”.[C6-1240]\r\n\r\nRuby’s conduct on November 22 and 23, 1963, corroborates his denial\r\nthat he knew Bernard Weissman. Ruby expressed hostility to the November\r\n22 full-page advertisement to many persons. To none did he give any\r\nindication that he was familiar with the person listed as responsible\r\nfor the advertisement.[C6-1241] His attempt on November 23 to trace the\r\nholder of the post office box shown on the “Impeach Earl Warren” sign\r\nand to locate Weissman’s name in a Dallas city directory[C6-1242] also\r\ntends to indicate that in fact he was not familiar with Weissman. Had\r\nhe been involved in some type of unlawful activity with Weissman, it is\r\nhighly unlikely that Ruby would have called attention to Weissman as he\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nInvestigation has disclosed no evidence that Officer J. D. Tippit was\r\nacquainted with either Ruby or Oswald. Neither Tippit’s wife nor his\r\nclose friends knew of such an acquaintanceship.[C6-1243] Tippit was not\r\nknown to frequent nightclubs[C6-1244] and he had no reason during the\r\ncourse of his police duties to enter Ruby’s clubs.[C6-1245] Although at\r\nthe time of the assassination Tippit was working weekends in a Dallas\r\nrestaurant owned by a member of the John Birch Society, the restaurant\r\nowner stated that he never discussed politics with Tippit.[C6-1246]\r\nPersons close to Tippit related that Tippit rarely discussed political\r\nmatters with any person and that he was a member of no political\r\norganization.[C6-1247] Telephone records for the period following\r\nSeptember 26, 1963, revealed no suspicious long-distance calls from the\r\nTippit household.[C6-1248]\r\n\r\nTippit’s encounter with Oswald following the shooting of the President\r\nis indicative of no prior association between the two men. Police radio\r\nlogs show that, as part of general directions issued to all officers\r\nimmediately after the assassination, Tippit was specifically directed\r\nto patrol the Oak Cliff area where he came upon Oswald.[C6-1249] His\r\nmovement from the area which he had been patrolling into the central\r\nOak Cliff area was also in conformity with the normal procedure of the\r\nDallas Police Department for patrol cars to cover nearby districts when\r\nthe patrol cars in that district became otherwise engaged, as occurred\r\nafter the assassination.[C6-1250] Oswald fit the general description,\r\nwhich, 15 minutes after the assassination, was broadcast to all police\r\ncars of a suspect described by a bystander who had seen Oswald in the\r\nsixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository.[C6-1251] There\r\nis thus no basis for any inference that, in approaching Oswald, Tippit\r\nwas acting other than in the line of police duty.\r\n\r\n_Allegations of Cuban activity._--No substantiation has been found for\r\nrumors linking Ruby with pro- or anti-Castro Cuban activities,[C6-1252]\r\nexcept for one incident in January 1959 when Ruby made preliminary\r\ninquiries, as a middleman, concerning the possible sale to Cuba of\r\nsome surplus jeeps located in Shreveport, La., and asked about the\r\npossible release of prisoners from a Cuban prison. No evidence has\r\nbeen developed that the project ever became more than a “possibility”.\r\nRuby explained that in early 1959 United States sentiment toward Cuba\r\nwas still favorable and that he was merely pursuing a money-making\r\nopportunity.[C6-1253]\r\n\r\nDuring the period of the “jeep sale”, R. D. Matthews, a gambler and\r\na “passing acquaintance” of Ruby, returned to Dallas from Havana\r\nwhere he had been living. In mid-1959, he returned to Cuba until\r\nmid-1960.[C6-1254] On October 3, 1963, a telephone call was made from\r\nthe Carousel Club to Matthews’ former wife in Shreveport.[C6-1255] No\r\nevidence has been uncovered that Matthews was associated with the sale\r\nof jeeps or the release of prisoners or that he knew of Oswald prior to\r\nthe assassination.[C6-1256] Matthews’ ex-wife did not recall the phone\r\ncall in October of 1963, and she asserted that she did not know Jack\r\nRuby or anybody working for him.[C6-1257]\r\n\r\nIn September 1959, Ruby traveled to Havana as a guest of a close friend\r\nand known gambler, Lewis J. McWillie. Both Ruby and McWillie state the\r\ntrip was purely social.[C6-1258] In January 1961, McWillie left Cuba\r\nwith strong feelings of hostility to the Castro regime. In early 1963,\r\nRuby purchased a pistol which he shipped to McWillie in Nevada, but\r\nMcWillie did not accept the package.[C6-1259] The Commission has found\r\nno evidence that McWillie has engaged in any activities since leaving\r\nCuba that are related to pro- or anti-Castro political movements or\r\nthat he was involved in Ruby’s abortive jeep transaction.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has also received evidence that in April 1962, a\r\ntelegram sent to Havana, Cuba, was charged to the business telephone of\r\nEarl Ruby, brother of Jack Ruby.[C6-1260] Earl Ruby stated that he was\r\nunable to recall that telegram but testified that he had never traveled\r\nto Cuba nor had any dealings with persons in Cuba.[C6-1261] Jack Ruby\r\nis not known to have visited his brother at that time, and during that\r\nperiod Earl and Jack did not maintain a close relationship.[C6-1262]\r\nEarl Ruby is not known to have been involved in any subversive\r\nactivities.[C6-1263]\r\n\r\nFinally, examination of FBI information relative to Cuban groups in the\r\nDallas-Fort Worth area for the year 1963 fails to disclose any person\r\nwho might provide a link between Ruby and such groups.[C6-1264] The\r\nCentral Intelligence Agency has no information suggesting that Jack\r\nRuby or any of his closest associates have been involved in any type of\r\nrevolutionary or subversive Cuban activity.[C6-1265]\r\n\r\n_Possible underworld connections._--The Commission has investigated\r\nRuby’s possible criminal activities, looking with particular concern\r\nfor evidence that he engaged in illegal activities with members of the\r\norganized underworld or that, on his own, he was a promoter of illegal\r\nendeavors. The results of that investigation are more fully detailed in\r\nappendix XVI. Ruby was reared in a Chicago neighborhood where he became\r\nacquainted with local criminals and with persons who later became\r\ncriminals. Throughout his life, Ruby’s friendships with persons of that\r\ncharacter were limited largely to professional gamblers, although his\r\nnight club businesses brought him in contact with persons who had been\r\nconvicted of other offenses. There is no credible evidence that Ruby,\r\nhimself, gambled on other than a social basis or that he had any unpaid\r\ngambling debts.[C6-1266] He had never been charged with a felony prior\r\nto his attack on Oswald; his only encounters in Chicago stemmed from\r\nticket scalping and the unauthorized sale of copyrighted music; and, in\r\nDallas, his law violations, excluding traffic charges, resulted from\r\nthe operation of his clubs or outbursts of temper.[C6-1267] Ruby has\r\ndisclaimed that he was associated with organized criminal activities,\r\nand law enforcement agencies have confirmed that denial.[C6-1268]\r\n\r\n_Investigation of George Senator._--In addition to examining Ruby’s own\r\nactivities and background, the Commission has paid careful attention to\r\nthe activities and background of George Senator, Ruby’s roommate and\r\none of his closest friends in Dallas. Senator was interrogated by staff\r\nmembers over a 2-day period; he provided a detailed account of his own\r\nlife and cooperated fully in all aspects of the Commission’s inquiry\r\ninto the activities of Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nSenator was 50 years old at the time Ruby shot Oswald. He had been born\r\nSeptember 4, 1913, in Gloversville, N.Y., and had received an eighth\r\ngrade education. Upon leaving school, he worked in Gloversville and\r\nNew York City until about age 25. For the next few years he worked\r\nin various restaurants and cafeterias in New York and Florida until\r\nenlisting in the Army in August 1941.[C6-1269] After his honorable\r\ndischarge in September 1945, Senator was employed for most of the\r\nnext 13 years selling inexpensive dresses throughout the South and\r\nSouthwest. In the course of that employment he moved to Dallas where\r\nhe met Jack Ruby while visiting Ruby’s Vegas Club in about 1955\r\nor 1956.[C6-1270] Ruby was one of many who helped Senator when he\r\nencountered financial difficulties during the years 1958 to 1962. For a\r\nwhile in 1962, Ruby provided room and board in exchange for Senator’s\r\nhelp in his clubs and apartment. In August 1963, Senator was unable to\r\nmaintain his own apartment alone following his roommate’s marriage.\r\nRuby again offered to help and on November 1, 1963, Senator moved into\r\nRuby’s apartment.[C6-1271] The Commission has found no evidence that\r\nSenator ever engaged in any political activities.[C6-1272]\r\n\r\nAgainst this background the Commission has evaluated Senator’s account\r\nof his own activities on November 22, 23, and 24. When questioned by\r\nDallas and Federal authorities hours after the shooting of Oswald,\r\nSenator omitted mention of having accompanied Ruby to photograph the\r\n“Impeach Earl Warren” sign on Saturday morning. Senator stated to\r\nCommission staff members that in the interviews of November 24 he\r\nomitted the incident because of oversight.[C6-1273] However, he spoke\r\nfreely about it in his sworn testimony and no inaccuracies have been\r\nnoted in that portion of his testimony. Senator also failed to mention\r\nto the Commission and to previous interrogators that, shortly after\r\nRuby left their apartment Sunday morning, he called friends, Mr. and\r\nMrs. William Downey, and offered to visit their apartment and make\r\nbreakfast for them.[C6-1274] Downey stated, in June 1964, that Senator\r\nsaid he was alone and that, after Downey declined the offer, Senator\r\nremarked that he would then go downtown for breakfast.[C6-1275] When\r\ntold of Downey’s account, Senator denied it and explained that the two\r\nwere not friendly by the time Senator left Dallas about six weeks after\r\nthe assassination.[C6-1276]\r\n\r\nThe Commission also experienced difficulty in ascertaining the\r\nactivities of Senator on November 22 and 23. He was unable to\r\naccount specifically for large segments of time when he was not with\r\nRuby.[C6-1277] And, as to places and people Senator says he visited\r\non those days prior to the time Oswald was shot, the Commission has\r\nbeen unsuccessful in obtaining verification.[C6-1278] Senator admitted\r\nthat he had spent much of that time drinking but denied that he was\r\nintoxicated.[C6-1279]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to know with complete certainty whether Senator had\r\nany foreknowledge of the shooting of Oswald. Ruby testified that at\r\nabout 10:15 a.m. on Sunday morning, November 24, he said, in Senator’s\r\npresence, “If something happened to this person, that then Mrs.\r\nKennedy won’t have to come back for the trial.”[C6-1280] According\r\nto Ruby, this is the most explicit statement he made concerning\r\nOswald that morning.[C6-1281] Senator denies any knowledge of Ruby’s\r\nintentions.[C6-1282]\r\n\r\nSenator’s general response to the shooting was not like that of a\r\nperson seeking to conceal his guilt. Shortly before it was known that\r\nRuby was the slayer of Oswald, Senator visited the Eatwell Restaurant\r\nin downtown Dallas. Upon being informed that Ruby was the attacker,\r\nSenator exclaimed, “My God,” in what appeared to be a genuinely\r\nsurprised tone.[C6-1283] He then ran to a telephone, returned to gulp\r\ndown his coffee, and quickly departed.[C6-1284] He drove promptly to\r\nthe home of James Martin, an attorney and friend. Martin recalled that\r\nSenator’s concern was for his friend Ruby and not for himself.[C6-1285]\r\nMartin and Senator drove to the Dallas Police Department where\r\nSenator voluntarily submitted himself to police questioning, and\r\ngave interviews to newspaper and television reporters.[C6-1286] The\r\nCommission has concluded, on the basis of its investigation into\r\nSenator’s background, activities, and reaction to the shooting, that\r\nSenator did not aid or conspire with Jack Ruby in the killing of Oswald.\r\n\r\n_Ruby’s activities preceding President’s trip._--In addition to the\r\nbroad investigation into Ruby’s background and associations, the\r\nCommission delved particularly into Ruby’s pattern of activities during\r\nthe 2 months preceding President Kennedy’s visit to Dallas in order to\r\ndetermine whether there was unusual conduct which might be linked to\r\nthe President’s forthcoming trip.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has been able to account specifically for Jack Ruby’s\r\npresence in Dallas on every day after September 26, 1963, except\r\nfive--September 29, 30 and October 11, 14, and 24--and there is no\r\nevidence that he was out of the Dallas-Fort Worth area on those\r\ndays.[C6-1287] The report of one person who saw Ruby on September 28\r\nindicates that Ruby probably remained in Dallas on September 29 and\r\n30,[C6-1288] when Oswald was in Mexico City. The Commission has looked\r\nfor but has found no evidence that Ruby traveled to Mexico at that\r\ntime.[C6-1289] Both Ruby and Ralph Paul have stated that Ruby did not\r\nleave the Dallas-Fort Worth area during September, October, or November\r\n1963.[C6-1290]\r\n\r\nDuring October and November of 1963, Jack Ruby maintained his usual\r\nvigorous pace of business activities. In particular, he directed\r\nconsiderable attention to his two nightclubs and to other business\r\npromotions.[C6-1291] During the final month before the Kennedy trip,\r\nhis time was increasingly occupied with personnel problems at both his\r\nclubs. There is no indication that he devoted less than full attention\r\nto these matters or that he appeared preoccupied with other affairs.\r\nHis acquaintances did feel that Ruby seemed depressed and concerned\r\nthat his friends were deserting him.[C6-1292] However, there were no\r\nsigns of secretive conduct.\r\n\r\nScrutiny of Ruby’s activities during the several days preceding the\r\nPresident’s arrival in Dallas has revealed no indication of any\r\nunusual activity. Ruby is remembered to have discussed the President’s\r\nimpending trip with only two persons and only briefly.[C6-1293] Two\r\nnewspapers containing a description of the expected motorcade routes\r\nthrough Dallas and Fort Worth were found in Ruby’s car at the time of\r\nthis arrest. However, such papers circulated widely in Dallas, and\r\nRuby’s car, like his apartment, was so cluttered with other newspapers,\r\nnotebooks, brochures, cards, clothing, and personal items[C6-1294] that\r\nthere is no reason to attach any significance to the papers.\r\n\r\nAside from the results of the Commission’s investigation reported\r\nabove, there are other reasons to doubt that Jack Ruby would have shot\r\nOswald as he did if he had been involved in a conspiracy to carry out\r\nthe assassination, or that he would have been delegated to perform the\r\nshooting of Oswald on behalf of others who were involved in the slaying\r\nof the President. By striking in the city jail, Ruby was certain to\r\nbe apprehended. An attempt to silence Oswald by having Ruby kill him\r\nwould have presented exceptionally grave dangers to any other persons\r\ninvolved in the scheme. If the attempt had failed, Oswald might have\r\nbeen moved to disclose his confederates to the authorities. If it\r\nsucceeded, as it did, the additional killing might itself have produced\r\na trail to them. Moreover, Ruby was regarded by most persons who knew\r\nhim as moody and unstable--hardly one to have encouraged the confidence\r\nof persons involved in a sensitive conspiracy.[C6-1295]\r\n\r\nSince his apprehension, Jack Ruby has provided the Federal authorities\r\nwith several detailed accounts of his activities both preceding and\r\nfollowing the assassination of President Kennedy. Ruby has shown no\r\nreluctance to answer any questions addressed to him. The accounts\r\nprovided by Ruby are consistent with evidence available to the\r\nCommission from other sources.\r\n\r\nThese additional considerations are thus fully consistent with the\r\nresults of the Commission’s investigation. Rumors of a connection\r\nbetween Ruby and Oswald have proved groundless, while examination\r\nof Ruby’s background and associations, his behavior prior to the\r\nassassination, and his activities during the November 22-24 weekend\r\nhas yielded no evidence that Ruby conspired with anyone in planning\r\nor executing the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald. Whatever the legal\r\nculpability of Jack Ruby for his act of November 24, the evidence is\r\npersuasive that he acted independently in shooting Oswald.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased upon the investigation reviewed in this chapter, the Commission\r\nconcluded that there is no credible evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald\r\nwas part of a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy. Examination\r\nof the facts of the assassination itself revealed no indication that\r\nOswald was aided in the planning or execution of his scheme. Review\r\nof Oswald’s life and activities since 1959, although productive in\r\nilluminating the character of Lee Harvey Oswald (which is discussed\r\nin the next chapter), did not produce any meaningful evidence of a\r\nconspiracy. The Commission discovered no evidence that the Soviet Union\r\nor Cuba were involved in the assassination of President Kennedy. Nor\r\ndid the Commission’s investigation of Jack Ruby produce any grounds\r\nfor believing that Ruby’s killing of Oswald was part of a conspiracy.\r\nThe conclusion that there is no evidence of a conspiracy was also\r\nreached independently by Dean Rusk, the Secretary of State; Robert S.\r\nMcNamara, the Secretary of Defense; C. Douglas Dillon, the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury; Robert F. Kennedy, the Attorney General; J. Edgar Hoover,\r\nthe Director of the FBI; John A. McCone, the Director of the CIA; and\r\nJames J. Rowley, the Chief of the Secret Service, on the basis of the\r\ninformation available to each of them.[C6-1296]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nLee Harvey Oswald: Background and Possible Motives\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence reviewed above identifies Lee Harvey Oswald as the\r\nassassin of President Kennedy and indicates that he acted alone in\r\nthat event. There is no evidence that he had accomplices or that he\r\nwas involved in any conspiracy directed to the assassination of the\r\nPresident. There remains the question of what impelled Oswald to\r\nconceive and to carry out the assassination of the President of the\r\nUnited States. The Commission has considered many possible motives\r\nfor the assassination, including those which might flow from Oswald’s\r\ncommitment to Marxism or communism, the existence of some personal\r\ngrievance, a desire to effect changes in the structure of society or\r\nsimply to go down in history as a well publicized assassin. None of\r\nthese possibilities satisfactorily explains Oswald’s act if it is\r\njudged by the standards of reasonable men. The motives of any man,\r\nhowever, must be analyzed in terms of the character and state of mind\r\nof the particular individual involved. For a motive that appears\r\nincomprehensible to other men may be the moving force of a man whose\r\nview of the world has been twisted, possibly by factors of which\r\nthose around him were only dimly aware. Oswald’s complete state of\r\nmind and character are now outside of the power of man to know. He\r\ncannot, of course, be questioned or observed by those charged with the\r\nresponsibility for this report or by experts on their behalf. There is,\r\nhowever, a large amount of material available in his writings and in\r\nthe history of his life which does give some insight into his character\r\nand, possibly, into the motives for his act.\r\n\r\nSince Oswald is dead, the Commission is not able to reach any definite\r\nconclusions as to whether or not he was “sane” under prevailing legal\r\nstandards. Under our system of justice no forum could properly make\r\nthat determination unless Oswald were before it. It certainly could\r\nnot be made by this Commission which, as has been pointed out above,\r\nascertained the facts surrounding the assassination but did not draw\r\nconclusions concerning Oswald’s legal guilt.\r\n\r\nIndications of Oswald’s motivation may be obtained from a study of\r\nthe events, relationships and influences which appear to have been\r\nsignificant in shaping his character and in guiding him. Perhaps\r\nthe most outstanding conclusion of such a study is that Oswald was\r\nprofoundly alienated from the world in which he lived. His life was\r\ncharacterized by isolation, frustration, and failure. He had very\r\nfew, if any, close relationships with other people and he appeared to\r\nhave great difficulty in finding a meaningful place in the world. He\r\nwas never satisfied with anything. When he was in the United States\r\nhe resented the capitalist system which he thought was exploiting him\r\nand others like him. He seemed to prefer the Soviet Union and he spoke\r\nhighly of Cuba.[C7-1] When he was in the Soviet Union, he apparently\r\nresented the Communist Party members, who were accorded special\r\nprivileges and who he thought were betraying communism, and he spoke\r\nwell of the United States.[C7-2] He accused his wife of preferring\r\nothers to himself and told her to return to the Soviet Union without\r\nhim but without a divorce. At the same time he professed his love for\r\nher and said that he could not get along without her.[C7-3] Marina\r\nOswald thought that he would not be happy anywhere, “Only on the moon,\r\nperhaps.”[C7-4]\r\n\r\nWhile Oswald appeared to most of those who knew him as a meek and\r\nharmless person, he sometimes imagined himself as “the Commander”[C7-5]\r\nand, apparently seriously, as a political prophet--a man who said that\r\nafter 20 years he would be prime minister.[C7-6] His wife testified\r\nthat he compared himself with great leaders of history. Such ideas of\r\ngrandeur were apparently accompanied by notions of oppression.[C7-7]\r\nHe had a great hostility toward his environment, whatever it happened\r\nto be, which he expressed in striking and sometimes violent acts long\r\nbefore the assassination. There was some quality about him that led\r\nhim to act with an apparent disregard for possible consequences.[C7-8]\r\nHe defected to the Soviet Union, shot at General Walker, tried to go\r\nto Cuba and even contemplated hijacking an airplane to get there. He\r\nassassinated the President, shot Officer Tippit, resisted arrest and\r\ntried to kill another policeman in the process.\r\n\r\nOswald apparently started reading about communism when he was about 15.\r\nIn the Marines, he evidenced a strong conviction as to the correctness\r\nof Marxist doctrine, which one associate described as “irrevocable,”\r\nbut also as “theoretical”; that associate did not think that Oswald was\r\na Communist.[C7-9] Oswald did not always distinguish between Marxism\r\nand communism.[C7-10] He stated several times that he was a Communist\r\nbut apparently never joined any Communist Party.[C7-11]\r\n\r\nHis attachment to Marxist and Communist doctrine was probably, in some\r\nmeasure, an expression of his hostility to his environment. While there\r\nis doubt about how fully Oswald understood the doctrine which he so\r\noften espoused, it seems clear that his commitment to Marxism was an\r\nimportant factor influencing his conduct during his adult years. It was\r\nan obvious element in his decision to go to Russia and later to Cuba\r\nand it probably influenced his decision to shoot at General Walker. It\r\nwas a factor which contributed to his character and thereby might have\r\ninfluenced his decision to assassinate President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nThe discussion below will describe the events known to the Commission\r\nwhich most clearly reveals the formation and nature of Oswald’s\r\ncharacter. It will attempt to summarize the events of his early life,\r\nhis experience in New York City and in the Marine Corps, and his\r\ninterest in Marxism. It will examine his defection to the Soviet Union\r\nin 1959, his subsequent return to the United States and his life here\r\nafter June of 1962. The review of the latter period will evaluate his\r\npersonal and employment relations, his attempt to kill General Walker,\r\nhis political activities, and his unsuccessful attempt to go to Cuba in\r\nlate September of 1963. Various possible motives will be treated in the\r\nappropriate context of the discussion outlined above.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Early Years\r\n\r\nSignificant in shaping the character of Lee Harvey Oswald was the death\r\nof his father, a collector of insurance premiums. This occurred 2\r\nmonths before Lee was born in New Orleans on October 18, 1939.[C7-12]\r\nThat death strained the financial fortunes of the remainder of the\r\nOswald family. It had its effect on Lee’s mother, Marguerite, his\r\nbrother Robert, who had been born in 1934, and his half-brother\r\nJohn Pic, who had been born in 1932 during Marguerite’s previous\r\nmarriage.[C7-13] It forced Marguerite Oswald to go to work to provide\r\nfor her family.[C7-14] Reminding her sons that they were orphans and\r\nthat the family’s financial condition was poor, she placed John Pic\r\nand Robert Oswald in an orphans’ home.[C7-15] From the time Marguerite\r\nOswald returned to work until December 26, 1942, when Lee too was sent\r\nto the orphans’ home, he was cared for principally by his mother’s\r\nsister, by babysitters and by his mother, when she had time for\r\nhim.[C7-16]\r\n\r\nMarguerite Oswald withdrew Lee from the orphans’ home and took him\r\nwith her to Dallas when he was a little over 4 years old.[C7-17] About\r\n6 months later she also withdrew John Pic and Robert Oswald.[C7-18]\r\nApparently that action was taken in anticipation of her marriage to\r\nEdwin A. Ekdahl, which took place in May of 1945.[C7-19] In the fall of\r\nthat year John Pic and Robert Oswald went to a military academy where\r\nthey stayed, except for vacations, until the spring of 1948.[C7-20] Lee\r\nOswald remained with his mother and Ekdahl,[C7-21] to whom he became\r\nquite attached. John Pic testified that he thought Lee found in Ekdahl\r\nthe father that he never had.[C7-22] That situation, however, was\r\nshort-lived, for the relations between Marguerite Oswald and Ekdahl\r\nwere stormy and they were finally divorced, after several separations\r\nand reunions, in the summer of 1948.[C7-23]\r\n\r\nAfter the divorce Mrs. Oswald complained considerably about how\r\nunfairly she was treated, dwelling on the fact that she was a widow\r\nwith three children. John Pic, however, did not think her position was\r\nworse than that of many other people.[C7-24] In the fall of 1948 she\r\ntold John Pic and Robert Oswald that she could not afford to send them\r\nback to the military school and she asked Pic to quit school entirely\r\nto help support the family, which he did for 4 months in the fall of\r\n1948.[C7-25] In order to supplement their income further she falsely\r\nswore that Pic was 17 years old so that he could join the Marine\r\nCorps Reserves.[C7-26] Pic did turn over part of his income to his\r\nmother, but he returned to high school in January of 1949, where he\r\nstayed until 3 days before he was scheduled to graduate, when he left\r\nschool in order to get into the Coast Guard.[C7-27] Since his mother\r\ndid not approve of his decision to continue school he accepted the\r\nresponsibility for that decision himself and signed his mother’s name\r\nto all his own excuses and report cards.[C7-28]\r\n\r\nPic thought that his mother overstated her financial problems and was\r\nunduly concerned about money. Referring to the period after the divorce\r\nfrom Ekdahl, which was apparently caused in part by Marguerite’s\r\ndesire to get more money from him, Pic said: “Lee was brought up in\r\nthis atmosphere of constant money problems, and I am sure it had quite\r\nan effect on him, and also Robert.”[C7-29] Marguerite Oswald worked\r\nin miscellaneous jobs after her divorce from Ekdahl.[C7-30] When she\r\nworked for a time as an insurance saleslady, she would sometimes\r\ntake Lee with her, apparently leaving him alone in the car while she\r\ntransacted her business.[C7-31] When she worked during the school year,\r\nLee had to leave an empty house in the morning, return to it for lunch\r\nand then again at night, his mother having trained him to do that\r\nrather than to play with other children.[C7-32]\r\n\r\nAn indication of the nature of Lee’s character at this time was\r\nprovided in the spring of 1950, when he was sent to New Orleans to\r\nvisit the family of his mother’s sister, Mrs. Lillian Murret, for 2\r\nor 3 weeks. Despite their urgings, he refused to play with the other\r\nchildren his own age.[C7-33] It also appears that Lee tried to tag\r\nalong with his older brothers but apparently was not able to spend as\r\nmuch time with them as he would have liked, because of the age gaps\r\nof 5 and 7 years, which became more significant as the children grew\r\nolder.[C7-34]\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York City\r\n\r\nWhatever problems may have been created by Lee’s home life in Louisiana\r\nand Texas, he apparently adjusted well enough there to have had an\r\naverage, although gradually deteriorating, school record with no\r\nbehavior or truancy problems. That was not the case, however, after\r\nhe and his mother moved to New York in August of 1952, shortly\r\nbefore Lee’s 13th birthday. They moved shortly after Robert joined\r\nthe Marines; they lived for a time with John Pic who was stationed\r\nthere with the Coast Guard.[C7-35] Relations soon became strained,\r\nhowever,[C7-36] so in late September Lee and his mother moved to\r\ntheir own apartment in the Bronx.[C7-37] Pic and his wife would\r\nhave been happy to have kept Lee, however, who was becoming quite a\r\ndisciplinary problem for his mother, having struck her on at least one\r\noccasion.[C7-38]\r\n\r\nThe short-lived stay with the Pics was terminated after an incident in\r\nwhich Lee allegedly pulled out a pocket knife during an argument and\r\nthreatened to use it on Mrs. Pic. When Pic returned home, Mrs. Oswald\r\ntried to play down the event but Mrs. Pic took a different view and\r\nasked the Oswalds to leave. Lee refused to discuss the matter with Pic,\r\nwhom he had previously idolized, and their relations were strained\r\nthereafter.[C7-39]\r\n\r\nOn September 30, 1952, Lee enrolled in P.S. 117,[C7-40] a junior\r\nhigh school in the Bronx, where the other children apparently teased\r\nhim because of his “western” clothes and Texas accent.[C7-41] He\r\nbegan to stay away from school, preferring to read magazines and\r\nwatch television at home by himself.[C7-42] This continued despite\r\nthe efforts of the school authorities and, to a lesser extent, of\r\nhis mother to have him return to school.[C7-43] Truancy charges were\r\nbrought against him alleging that he was “beyond the control of his\r\nmother insofar as school attendance is concerned.”[C7-44] Lee Oswald\r\nwas remanded for psychiatric observation to Youth House, an institution\r\nin which children are kept for psychiatric observation or for detention\r\npending court appearance or commitment to a child-caring or custodial\r\ninstitution such as a training school.[C7-45] He was in Youth House\r\nfrom April 16 to May 7, 1953,[C7-46] during which time he was examined\r\nby its Chief Psychiatrist, Dr. Renatus Hartogs, and interviewed and\r\nobserved by other members of the Youth House staff.[C7-47]\r\n\r\nMarguerite Oswald visited her son at Youth House, where she recalled\r\nthat she waited in line “with Puerto Ricans and Negroes and\r\neverything.”[C7-48] She said that her pocketbook was searched “because\r\nthe children in this home were such criminals, dope fiends, and had\r\nbeen in criminal offenses, that anybody entering this home had to be\r\nsearched in case the parents were bringing cigarettes or narcotics or\r\nanything.”[C7-49] She recalled that Lee cried and said, “Mother, I want\r\nto get out of here. There are children in here who have killed people,\r\nand smoke. I want to get out.”[C7-50] Marguerite Oswald said that she\r\nhad not realized until then in what kind of place her son had been\r\nconfined.[C7-51]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Lee told his probation officer, John Carro, that\r\n“while he liked Youth House he miss[ed] the freedom of doing what he\r\nwanted. He indicated that he did not miss his mother.”[C7-52] Mrs.\r\nEvelyn Strickman Siegel, a social worker who interviewed both Lee and\r\nhis mother while Lee was confined in Youth House, reported that Lee\r\n“confided that the worse thing about Youth House was the fact that he\r\nhad to be with other boys all the time, was disturbed about disrobing\r\nin front of them, taking showers with them etc.”[C7-53]\r\n\r\nContrary to reports that appeared after the assassination, the\r\npsychiatric examination did not indicate that Lee Oswald was\r\na potential assassin, potentially dangerous, that “his outlook\r\non life had strongly paranoid overtones” or that he should be\r\ninstitutionalized.[C7-54] Dr. Hartogs did find Oswald to be a tense,\r\nwithdrawn, and evasive boy who intensely disliked talking about himself\r\nand his feelings. He noted that Lee liked to give the impression that\r\nhe did not care for other people but preferred to keep to himself,\r\nso that he was not bothered and did not have to make the effort of\r\ncommunicating. Oswald’s withdrawn tendencies and solitary habits\r\nwere thought to be the result of “intense anxiety, shyness, feelings\r\nof awkwardness and insecurity.”[C7-55] He was reported to have said\r\n“I don’t want a friend and I don’t like to talk to people” and “I\r\ndislike everybody.”[C7-56] He was also described as having a “vivid\r\nfantasy life, turning around the topics of omnipotence and power,\r\nthrough which he tries to compensate for his present shortcomings and\r\nfrustrations.”[C7-57] Dr. Hartogs summarized his report by stating:\r\n\r\n    This 13 year old well built boy has superior mental resources\r\n    and functions only slightly below his capacity level in spite\r\n    of chronic truancy from school which brought him into Youth\r\n    House. No finding of neurological impairment or psychotic\r\n    mental changes could be made. Lee has to be diagnosed as\r\n    “personality pattern disturbance with schizoid features and\r\n    passive-aggressive tendencies.” Lee has to be seen as an\r\n    emotionally, quite disturbed youngster who suffers under the\r\n    impact of really existing emotional isolation and deprivation,\r\n    lack of affection, absence of family life and rejection by a\r\n    self involved and conflicted mother.[C7-58]\r\n\r\nDr. Hartogs recommended that Oswald be placed on probation on condition\r\nthat he seek help and guidance through a child guidance clinic. There,\r\nhe suggested, Lee should be treated by a male psychiatrist who could\r\nsubstitute for the lack of a father figure. He also recommended that\r\nMrs. Oswald seek “psychotherapeutic guidance through contact with a\r\nfamily agency.” The possibility of commitment was to be considered only\r\nif the probation plan was not successful.[C7-59]\r\n\r\nLee’s withdrawal was also noted by Mrs. Siegel, who described him as\r\na “seriously detached, withdrawn youngster.”[C7-60] She also noted\r\nthat there was “a rather pleasant, appealing quality about this\r\nemotionally starved, affectionless youngster which grows as one speaks\r\nto him.”[C7-61] She thought that he had detached himself from the\r\nworld around him because “no one in it ever met any of his needs for\r\nlove.”[C7-62] She observed that since Lee’s mother worked all day,\r\nhe made his own meals and spent all his time alone because he didn’t\r\nmake friends with the boys in the neighborhood. She thought that he\r\n“withdrew into a completely solitary and detached existence where he\r\ndid as he wanted and he didn’t have to live by any rules or come into\r\ncontact with people.”[C7-63] Mrs. Siegel concluded that Lee “just\r\nfelt that his mother never gave a damn for him. He always felt like\r\na burden that she simply just had to tolerate.”[C7-64] Lee confirmed\r\nsome of those observations by saying that he felt almost as if there\r\nwere a veil between him and other people through which they could not\r\nreach him, but that he preferred the veil to remain intact. He admitted\r\nto fantasies about being powerful and sometimes hurting and killing\r\npeople, but refused to elaborate on them. He took the position that\r\nsuch matters were his own business.[C7-65]\r\n\r\nA psychological human figure-drawing test corroborated the\r\ninterviewer’s findings that Lee was insecure and had limited social\r\ncontacts. Irving Sokolow, a Youth House psychologist reported that:\r\n\r\n    The Human Figure Drawings are empty, poor characterizations\r\n    of persons approximately the same age as the subject. They\r\n    reflect a considerable amount of impoverishment in the social\r\n    and emotional areas. He appears to be a somewhat insecure\r\n    youngster exhibiting much inclination for warm and satisfying\r\n    relationships to others. There is some indication that he may\r\n    relate to men more easily than to women in view of the more\r\n    mature conceptualisation. He appears slightly withdrawn and in\r\n    view of the lack of detail within the drawings this may assume\r\n    a more significant characteristic. He exhibits some difficulty\r\n    in relationship to the maternal figure suggesting more anxiety\r\n    in this area than in any other.[C7-66]\r\n\r\nLee scored an IQ of 118 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for\r\nChildren. According to Sokolow, this indicated a “present intellectual\r\nfunctioning in the upper range of bright normal intelligence.”[C7-67]\r\nSokolow said that although Lee was “presumably disinterested in school\r\nsubjects he operates on a much higher than average level.”[C7-68] On\r\nthe Monroe Silent Reading Test, Lee’s score indicated no retardation in\r\nreading speed and comprehension; he had better than average ability in\r\narithmetical reasoning for his age group.[C7-69]\r\n\r\nLee told Carro, his probation officer, that he liked to be by himself\r\nbecause he had too much difficulty in making friends.[C7-70] The\r\nreports of Carro and Mrs. Siegel also indicate an ambivalent attitude\r\ntoward authority on Oswald’s part. Carro reported that Lee was\r\ndisruptive in class after he returned to school on a regular basis in\r\nthe fall of 1953. He had refused to salute the flag and was doing very\r\nlittle, if any, work. It appears that he did not want to do any of\r\nthe things which the authorities suggested in their efforts to bring\r\nhim out of the shell into which he appeared to be retreating.[C7-71]\r\nHe told Mrs. Siegel that he would run away if sent to a boarding\r\nschool. On the other hand he also told her that he wished his mother\r\nhad been more firm with him in her attempts to get him to return to\r\nschool.[C7-72]\r\n\r\nThe reports of the New York authorities indicate that Lee’s mother gave\r\nhim very little affection and did not serve as any sort of substitute\r\nfor a father. Furthermore she did not appear to understand her own\r\nrelationship to Lee’s psychological problems. After her interview with\r\nMrs. Oswald, Mrs. Siegel described her as a “smartly dressed, gray\r\nhaired woman, very self-possessed and alert and superficially affable,”\r\nbut essentially a “defensive, rigid, self-involved person who had real\r\ndifficulty in accepting and relating to people” and who had “little\r\nunderstanding” of Lee’s behavior and of the “protective shell he has\r\ndrawn around himself.”[C7-73] Dr. Hartogs reported that Mrs. Oswald\r\ndid not understand that Lee’s withdrawal was a form of “violent but\r\nsilent protest against his neglect by her and represents his reaction\r\nto a complete absence of any real family life.”[C7-74] Carro reported\r\nthat when questioned about his mother Lee said, “well I’ve got to live\r\nwith her. I guess I love her.”[C7-75] It may also be significant that,\r\nas reported by John Pic, “Lee slept with my mother until I joined the\r\nservice in 1950. This would make him approximately 10, well, almost 11\r\nyears old.”[C7-76]\r\n\r\nThe factors in Lee Oswald’s personality which were noted by those who\r\nhad contact with him in New York indicate that he had great difficulty\r\nin adapting himself to conditions in that city. His usual reaction to\r\nthe problems which he encountered there was simply withdrawal. Those\r\nfactors indicated a severe inability to enter into relationships with\r\nother people. In view of his experiences when he visited his relatives\r\nin New Orleans in the spring of 1950, and his other solitary habits,\r\nLee had apparently been experiencing similar problems before going to\r\nNew York, and as will be shown below, this failure to adapt to his\r\nenvironment was a dominant trait in his later life.\r\n\r\nIt would be incorrect, however, to believe that those aspects of Lee’s\r\npersonality which were observed in New York could have led anyone to\r\npredict the outburst of violence which finally occurred. Carro was the\r\nonly one of Oswald’s three principal observers who recommended that\r\nhe be placed in a boy’s home or similar institution.[C7-77] But Carro\r\nwas quite specific that his recommendation was based primarily on the\r\nadverse factors in Lee’s environment--his lack of friends, the apparent\r\nunavailability of any agency assistance and the ineffectualness of\r\nhis mother--and not on any particular mental disturbance in the boy\r\nhimself.[C7-78] Carro testified that:\r\n\r\n    There was nothing that would lead me to believe when I saw\r\n    him at the age of 12 that there would be seeds of destruction\r\n    for somebody. I couldn’t in all honesty sincerely say such a\r\n    thing.[C7-79]\r\n\r\nMrs. Siegel concluded her report with the statement that:\r\n\r\n    Despite his withdrawal, he gives the impression that he is not\r\n    so difficult to reach as he appears and patient, prolonged\r\n    effort in a sustained relationship with one therapist might\r\n    bring results. There are indications that he has suffered\r\n    serious personality damage but if he can receive help quickly\r\n    this might be repaired to some extent.[C7-80]\r\n\r\nLee Oswald never received that help. Few social agencies even in New\r\nYork were equipped to provide the kind of intensive treatment that he\r\nneeded, and when one of the city’s clinics did find room to handle him,\r\nfor some reason the record does not show, advantage was never taken of\r\nthe chance afforded to Oswald. When Lee became a disciplinary problem\r\nupon his return to school in the fall of 1953, and when his mother\r\nfailed to cooperate in any way with school authorities, authorities\r\nwere finally forced to consider placement in a home for boys. Such a\r\nplacement was postponed, however, perhaps in part at least because\r\nLee’s behavior suddenly improved. Before the court took any action,\r\nthe Oswalds left New York[C7-81] in January of 1954, and returned to\r\nNew Orleans where Lee finished the ninth grade before he left school\r\nto work for a year.[C7-82] Then in October of 1956, he joined the\r\nMarines.[C7-83]\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn to New Orleans and Joining the Marine Corps\r\n\r\nAfter his return to New Orleans Oswald was teased at school because of\r\nthe northern accent which he had acquired.[C7-84] He concluded that\r\nschool had nothing to offer him.[C7-85] His mother exercised little\r\ncontrol over him and thought he could decide for himself whether to go\r\non in school.[C7-86] Neighbors and others who knew him at that time\r\nrecall an introverted boy who read a great deal.[C7-87] He took walks\r\nand visited museums, and sometimes rode a rented bicycle in the park\r\non Saturday mornings.[C7-88] Mrs. Murret believes that he talked at\r\nlength with a girl on the telephone, but no one remembers that he had\r\nany dates.[C7-89] A friend, Edward Voebel, testified that “he was more\r\nbashful about girls than anything else.”[C7-90]\r\n\r\nSeveral witnesses testified that Lee Oswald was not aggressive.[C7-91]\r\nHe was, however, involved in some fights. Once a group of white boys\r\nbeat him up for sitting in the Negro section of a bus, which he\r\napparently did simply out of ignorance.[C7-92] Another time, he fought\r\nwith two brothers who claimed that he had picked on the younger of\r\nthem, 3 years Oswald’s junior. Two days later, “some big guy, probably\r\nfrom a high school--he looked like a tremendous football player”\r\naccosted Oswald on the way home from school and punched him in the\r\nmouth, making his lip bleed and loosening a tooth. Voebel took Oswald\r\nback to the school to attend to his wounds, and their “mild friendship”\r\nstemmed from that incident.[C7-93] Voebel also recalled that Oswald\r\nonce outlined a plan to cut the glass in the window of a store on\r\nRampart Street and steal a pistol, but he was not sure then that Oswald\r\nmeant to carry out the plan, and in fact they never did. Voebel said\r\nthat Oswald “wouldn’t start any fights, but if you wanted to start\r\none with him, he was going to make sure that he ended it, or you were\r\ngoing to really have one, because he wasn’t going to take anything from\r\nanybody.”[C7-94] In a space for the names of “close friends” on the\r\nninth grade personal history record, Oswald first wrote “Edward Vogel,”\r\nan obvious misspelling of Voebel’s name, and “Arthor Abear,” most\r\nlikely Arthur Hebert, a classmate who has said that he did not know\r\nOswald well. Oswald erased those names, however, and indicated that he\r\nhad no close friends.[C7-95]\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that this misspelling of names, apparently on a\r\nphonetic basis, was caused by a reading-spelling disability from which\r\nOswald appeared to suffer.[C7-96] Other evidence of the existence of\r\nsuch a disability is provided by the many other misspellings that\r\nappear in Oswald’s writings, portions of which are quoted below.\r\n\r\nSometime during this period, and under circumstances to be discussed\r\nmore fully below, Oswald started to read Communist literature, which he\r\nobtained from the public library.[C7-97] One of his fellow employees,\r\nPalmer McBride, stated that Oswald said he would like to kill President\r\nEisenhower because he was exploiting the working class.[C7-98] Oswald\r\npraised Khrushchev and suggested that he and McBride join the Communist\r\nParty “to take advantage of their social functions.”[C7-99] Oswald also\r\nbecame interested in the New Orleans Amateur Astronomy Association, an\r\norganization of high school students. The association’s then president,\r\nWilliam E. Wulf, testified that he remembered an occasion when Oswald\r\n\r\n    * * * started expounding the Communist doctrine and saying that\r\n    he was highly interested in communism, that communism was the\r\n    only way of life for the worker, et cetera, and then came out\r\n    with a statement that he was looking for a Communist cell in\r\n    town to join but he couldn’t find any. He was a little dismayed\r\n    at this, and he said that he couldn’t find any that would\r\n    show any interest in him as a Communist, and subsequently,\r\n    after this conversation, my father came in and we were kind of\r\n    arguing back and forth about the situation, and my father came\r\n    in the room, heard what we were arguing on communism, and that\r\n    this boy was loud-mouthed, boisterous, and my father asked him\r\n    to leave the house and politely put him out of the house, and\r\n    that is the last I have seen or spoken with Oswald.[C7-100]\r\n\r\nDespite this apparent interest in communism, Oswald tried to join the\r\nMarines when he was 16 years old.[C7-101] This was 1 year before his\r\nactual enlistment and just a little over 2½ years after he left New\r\nYork. He wrote a note in his mother’s name to school authorities in New\r\nOrleans saying that he was leaving school because he and his mother\r\nwere moving to San Diego. In fact, he had quit school in an attempt\r\nto obtain his mother’s assistance to join the Marines.[C7-102] While\r\nhe apparently was able to induce his mother to make a false statement\r\nabout his age he was nevertheless unable to convince the proper\r\nauthorities that he was really 17 years old.[C7-103] There is evidence\r\nthat Oswald was greatly influenced in his decision to join the Marines\r\nby the fact that his brother Robert had done so approximately 3 years\r\nbefore.[C7-104] Robert Oswald had given his Marine Corps manual to his\r\nbrother Lee, who studied it during the year following his unsuccessful\r\nattempt to enlist until “He knew it by heart.”[C7-105] According to\r\nMarguerite Oswald, “Lee lived for the time that he would become 17\r\nyears old to join the Marines--that whole year.”[C7-106] In John Pic’s\r\nview, Oswald was motivated to join the Marines in large part by a\r\ndesire “to get from out and under * * * the yoke of oppression from my\r\nmother.”[C7-107]\r\n\r\nOswald’s inability or lack of desire to enter into meaningful\r\nrelationships with other people continued during this period in New\r\nOrleans (1954-56).[C7-108] It probably contributed greatly to the\r\ngeneral dissatisfaction which he exhibited with his environment, a\r\ndissatisfaction which seemed to find expression at this particular\r\npoint in his intense desire to join the Marines and get away from his\r\nsurroundings and his mother. His study of Communist literature, which\r\nmight appear to be inconsistent with his desire to join the Marines,\r\ncould have been another manifestation of Oswald’s rejection of his\r\nenvironment.[C7-109]\r\n\r\nHis difficulty in relating to other people and his general\r\ndissatisfaction with the world around him continued while he was in\r\nthe Marine Corps. Kerry Thornley, a marine associate, who, shortly\r\nafter Oswald’s defection, wrote an as yet unpublished novel based in\r\nconsiderable part on Oswald’s life, testified that “definitely the\r\nMarine Corps was not what he had expected it to be when he joined.”\r\nHe said that Oswald “seemed to guard against developing real close\r\nfriendships.”[C7-110] Daniel Powers, another marine who was stationed\r\nwith Oswald for part of his marine career, testified that Oswald seemed\r\n“always [to be] striving for a relationship, but whenever he did * * *\r\nhis general personality would alienate the group against him.”[C7-111]\r\nOther marines also testified that Oswald had few friends and kept very\r\nmuch to himself.[C7-112]\r\n\r\nWhile there is nothing in Oswald’s military records to indicate that\r\nhe was mentally unstable or otherwise psychologically unfit for duty\r\nin the Marine Corps,[C7-113] he did not adjust well to conditions\r\nwhich he found in that service.[C7-114] He did not rise above the\r\nrank of private first class, even though he had passed a qualifying\r\nexamination for the rank of corporal.[C7-115] His Marine career was\r\nnot helped by his attitude that he was a man of great ability and\r\nintelligence and that many of his superiors in the Marine Corps were\r\nnot sufficiently competent to give him orders.[C7-116] While Oswald did\r\nnot seem to object to authority in the abstract, he did think that he\r\nshould be the one to exercise it. John E. Donovan, one of his former\r\nofficers, testified that Oswald thought “that authority, particularly\r\nthe Marine Corps, ought to be able to recognize talent such as his own,\r\nwithout a given magic college degree, and put them in positions of\r\nprominence.”[C7-117]\r\n\r\nOswald manifested this feeling about authority by baiting his officers.\r\nHe led them into discussions of foreign affairs about which they often\r\nknew less than he did, since he had apparently devoted considerable\r\ntime to a study of such matters.[C7-118] When the officers were unable\r\nto discuss foreign affairs satisfactorily with him, Oswald regarded\r\nthem as unfit to exercise command over him.[C7-119] Nelson Delgado,\r\none of Oswald’s fellow Marines, testified that Oswald tried to “cut up\r\nanybody that was high ranking” in those arguments “and make himself\r\ncome out top dog.”[C7-120] Oswald probably engaged his superiors in\r\narguments on a subject that he had studied in an attempt to attract\r\nattention to himself and to support his exaggerated idea of his own\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\nThornley also testified that he thought that Oswald’s extreme personal\r\nsloppiness in the Marine Corps “fitted into a general personality\r\npattern of his: to do whatever was not wanted of him, a recalcitrant\r\ntrend in his personality.”[C7-121] Oswald “seemed to be a person who\r\nwould go out of his way to get into trouble”[C7-122] and then used\r\nthe “special treatment” he received as an example of the way in which\r\nhe was being picked on and “as a means of getting or attempting to\r\nget sympathy.”[C7-123] In Thornley’s view, Oswald labored under a\r\npersecution complex which he strove to maintain and “felt the Marine\r\nCorps kept a pretty close watch on him because of his ‘subversive’\r\nactivities.” Thornley added: “I think it was kind of necessary to him\r\nto believe that he was being picked on. It wasn’t anything extreme. I\r\nwouldn’t go as far as to call it, call him a paranoid, but a definite\r\ntendency there was in that direction, I think.”[C7-124]\r\n\r\nPowers considered Oswald to be meek and easily led,[C7-125] an\r\n“individual that you would brainwash, and quite easy * * * [but]\r\nI think once he believed in something * * * he stood in his\r\nbeliefs.”[C7-126] Powers also testified that Oswald was reserved and\r\nseemed to be “somewhat the frail, little puppy in the litter.”[C7-127]\r\nHe had the nickname “Ozzie Rabbit.”[C7-128]\r\n\r\nOswald read a good deal, said Powers, but “he would never be reading\r\nany of the shoot-em-up westerns or anything like that. Normally,\r\nit would be a good type of literature; and the one that I recall\r\nwas ‘Leaves of Grass,’ by Walt Whitman.”[C7-129] According to\r\nPowers, Oswald said: “‘All the Marine Corps did was to teach you\r\nto kill’ and after you got out of the Marines you might be good\r\ngangsters.”[C7-130] Powers believed that when Oswald arrived in Japan\r\nhe acquired a girlfriend, “finally attaining a male status or image in\r\nhis own eyes.”[C7-131] That apparently caused Oswald to become more\r\nself-confident, aggressive and even somewhat pugnacious, although\r\nPowers “wouldn’t say that this guy is a troublemaker.”[C7-132] Powers\r\nsaid “now he was Oswald the man rather than Oswald the rabbit.”[C7-133]\r\nOswald once told Powers that he didn’t care if he returned to the\r\nUnited States at all.[C7-134]\r\n\r\nWhile in Japan, Oswald’s new found apparent self confidence and\r\npugnaciousness led to an incident in which he spilled a drink on one\r\nof his sergeants and abusively challenged him to fight.[C7-135] At the\r\ncourt-martial hearing which followed, Oswald admitted that he had been\r\nrather drunk when the incident occurred. He testified that he had felt\r\nthe sergeant had a grudge against him and that he had unsuccessfully\r\nsought a transfer from the sergeant’s unit. He said that he had simply\r\nwanted to discuss the question with the sergeant and the drink had\r\nbeen spilled accidentally. The hearing officer agreed with the latter\r\nclaim but found Oswald guilty of wrongfully using provoking words\r\nand sentenced him to 28 days, canceling the suspension of a 20-day\r\nsentence that Oswald had received in an earlier court-martial for\r\npossessing an unauthorized pistol with which he had accidentally shot\r\nhimself.[C7-136]\r\n\r\nAt his own request, Oswald was transferred from active duty to the\r\nMarine Corps Reserve under honorable conditions in September of 1959,\r\n3 months prior to his regularly scheduled separation date,[C7-137]\r\nostensibly to care for his mother who had been injured in an accident\r\nat her work.[C7-138] He was undesirably discharged from the Marine\r\nCorps Reserve, to which he had been assigned on inactive status\r\nfollowing his transfer from active duty, after it was learned that he\r\nhad defected to the Soviet Union.[C7-139] In an attempt to have this\r\ndischarge reversed, Oswald wrote to then Secretary of the Navy Connally\r\non January 30, 1962, stating that he would “employ all means to right\r\nthis gross mistake or injustice.”[C7-140]\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally had just resigned to run for Governor of Texas,\r\nso he advised Oswald that he had forwarded the letter to his\r\nsuccessor.[C7-141] It is thus clear that Oswald knew that Governor\r\nConnally was never directly concerned with his discharge and he must\r\nhave known that President Kennedy had had nothing to do with it. In\r\nthat connection, it does not appear that Oswald ever expressed any\r\ndissatisfaction of any kind with either the President or Governor\r\nConnally.[C7-142] Marina Oswald testified that she “had never heard\r\nanything bad about Kennedy from Lee. And he never had anything against\r\nhim.”[C7-143] Mrs. Oswald said that her husband did not say anything\r\nabout Governor Connally after his return to the United States. She\r\ntestified: “But while we were in Russia he spoke well of him. * * * Lee\r\nsaid that when he would return to the United States he would vote for\r\nhim [for Governor].”[C7-144] Oswald must have already learned that the\r\nGovernor could not help him with his discharge because he was no longer\r\nSecretary of the Navy, at the time he made that remark.\r\n\r\nEven though Oswald apparently did not express any hostility against\r\nthe President or Governor Connally, he continued to be concerned about\r\nhis undesirable discharge.[C7-145] It is clear that he thought he had\r\nbeen unjustly treated. Probably his complaint was due to the fact that\r\nhis discharge was not related to anything he had done while on active\r\nduty and also because he had not received any notice of the original\r\ndischarge proceedings, since his whereabouts were not known.[C7-146] He\r\ncontinued his efforts to reverse the discharge by petitioning the Navy\r\nDischarge Review Board, which finally declined to modify the discharge\r\nand so advised him in a letter dated July 25, 1963.[C7-147]\r\n\r\nGovernor Connally’s connection with the discharge, although indirect,\r\ncaused the Commission to consider whether he might have been Oswald’s\r\nreal target. In that connection, it should be noted that Marina Oswald\r\ntestified on September 6, 1964, that she thought her husband “was\r\nshooting at Connally rather than President Kennedy.” In support of her\r\nconclusion Mrs. Oswald noted her husband’s undesirable discharge and\r\nthat she could not think of any reason why Oswald would want to kill\r\nPresident Kennedy.[C7-148] It should be noted, however, that at the\r\ntime Oswald fired the shots at the Presidential limousine the Governor\r\noccupied the seat in front of the President, and it would have been\r\nalmost impossible for Oswald to have hit the Governor without hitting\r\nthe President first. Oswald could have shot the Governor as the car\r\napproached the Depository or as it was making the turn onto Elm Street.\r\nOnce it had started down Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass,\r\nhowever, the President almost completely blocked Oswald’s view of the\r\nGovernor prior to the time the first shot struck the President.[C7-150]\r\nFurthermore, Oswald would have had other and more favorable\r\nopportunities to strike at the Governor than on this occasion when, as\r\na member of the President’s party, he had more protection than usual.\r\nIt would appear, therefore, that to the extent Oswald’s undesirable\r\ndischarge affected his motivation, it was more in terms of a general\r\nhostility against the government and its representatives rather than a\r\ngrudge against any particular person.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterest in Marxism\r\n\r\nAs indicated above, Oswald started to read Communist literature after\r\nhe and his mother left New York and moved to New Orleans.[C7-151] He\r\ntold Aline Mosby, a reporter who interviewed him after he arrived in\r\nMoscow:\r\n\r\n    I’m a Marxist, * * * I became interested about the age of 15.\r\n    From an ideological viewpoint. An old lady handed me a pamphlet\r\n    about saving the Rosenbergs. * * * I looked at that paper and I\r\n    still remember it for some reason, I don’t know why.[C7-152]\r\n\r\nOswald studied Marxism after he joined the Marines and his sympathies\r\nin that direction and for the Soviet Union appear to have been widely\r\nknown, at least in the unit to which he was assigned after his return\r\nfrom the Far East. His interest in Russia led some of his associates\r\nto call him “comrade”[C7-153] or “Oswaldskovitch.”[C7-154] He always\r\nwanted to play the red pieces in chess because, as he said in an\r\napparently humorous context, he preferred the “Red Army.”[C7-155]\r\nHe studied the Russian language,[C7-156] read a Russian language\r\nnewspaper[C7-157] and seemed interested in what was going on in the\r\nSoviet Union.[C7-158] Thornley, who thought Oswald had an “irrevocable\r\nconviction” that his Marxist beliefs were correct, testified:\r\n\r\n    I think you could sit down and argue with him for a number\r\n    of years * * * and I don’t think you could have changed his\r\n    mind on that unless you knew why he believed it in the first\r\n    place. I certainly don’t. I don’t think with any kind of formal\r\n    argument you could have shaken that conviction. And that is why\r\n    I say irrevocable. It was just--never getting back to looking\r\n    at things from any other way once he had become a Marxist,\r\n    whenever that was.[C7-159]\r\n\r\nThornley also testified about an incident which grew out of a\r\ncombination of Oswald’s known Marxist sympathies and George Orwell’s\r\nbook “1984,” one of Oswald’s favorite books which Thornley read at\r\nOswald’s suggestion. Shortly after Thornley finished reading that\r\nbook the Marine unit to which both men were assigned was required\r\nto take part in a Saturday morning parade in honor of some retiring\r\nnoncommissioned officers, an event which they both approached with\r\nlittle enthusiasm. While waiting for the parade to start they talked\r\nbriefly about “1984” even though Oswald seemed to be lost in his own\r\nthoughts. After a brief period of silence Oswald remarked on the\r\nstupidity of the parade and on how angry it made him, to which Thornley\r\nreplied: “Well, comes the revolution you will change all that.”\r\nThornley testified:\r\n\r\n    At which time he looked at me like a betrayed Caesar and\r\n    screamed, screamed definitely, “Not you, too, Thornley.” And I\r\n    remember his voice cracked as he said this. He was definitely\r\n    disturbed at what I had said and I didn’t really think I had\r\n    said that much. * * * I never said anything to him again and he\r\n    never said anything to me again.[C7-160]\r\n\r\nThornley said that he had made his remark only in the context of “1984”\r\nand had not intended any criticism of Oswald’s political views which is\r\nthe way in which, Thornley thought, Oswald took his remarks.[C7-161]\r\n\r\nLieutenant Donovan testified that Oswald thought that “there were\r\nmany grave injustices concerning the affairs in the international\r\nsituation.” He recalled that Oswald had a specific interest in Latin\r\nAmerica, particularly Cuba, and expressed opposition to the Batista\r\nregime and sympathy for Castro, an attitude which, Donovan said,\r\nwas “not * * * unpopular” at that time. Donovan testified that he\r\nnever heard Oswald express a desire personally to take part in the\r\nelimination of injustices anywhere in the world and that he “never\r\nheard him in any way, shape or form confess that he was a Communist,\r\nor that he ever thought about being a Communist.”[C7-162] Delgado\r\ntestified that Oswald was “a complete believer that our way of\r\ngovernment was not quite right” and believed that our Government did\r\nnot have “too much to offer,” but was not in favor of “the Communist\r\nway of life.” Delgado and Oswald talked more about Cuba than Russia,\r\nand sometimes imagined themselves as leaders in the Cuban Army or\r\nGovernment, who might “lead an expedition to some of these other\r\nislands and free them too.”[C7-163]\r\n\r\nThornley also believed that Oswald’s Marxist beliefs led to an\r\nextraordinary view of history under which:\r\n\r\n    He looked upon the eyes of future people as some kind of\r\n    tribunal, and he wanted to be on the winning side so that\r\n    10,000 years from now people would look in the history books\r\n    and say, “Well, this man was ahead of his time.” * * * The\r\n    eyes of the future became * * * the eyes of God. * * * He was\r\n    concerned with his image in history and I do think that is why\r\n    he chose * * * the particular method [of defecting] he chose\r\n    and did it in the way he did. It got him in the newspapers. It\r\n    did broadcast his name out.[C7-164]\r\n\r\nThornley thought that Oswald not only wanted a place in history but\r\nalso wanted to live comfortably in the present. He testified that if\r\nOswald could not have that “degree of physical comfort that he expected\r\nor sought, I think he would then throw himself entirely on the other\r\nthing he also wanted, which was the image in history. * * * I think he\r\nwanted both if he could have them. If he didn’t, he wanted to die with\r\nthe knowledge that, or with the idea that he was somebody.”[C7-165]\r\n\r\nOswald’s interest in Marxism led some people to avoid him, even though\r\nas his wife suggested, that interest may have been motivated by a\r\ndesire to gain attention.[C7-166] He used his Marxist and associated\r\nactivities as excuses for his difficulties in getting along in the\r\nworld, which were usually caused by entirely different factors. His\r\nuse of those excuses to present himself to the world as a person who\r\nwas being unfairly treated is shown most clearly by his employment\r\nrelations after his return from the Soviet Union. Of course, he made\r\nhis real problems worse to the extent that his use of those excuses\r\nprevented him from discovering the real reasons for and attempting to\r\novercome his difficulties. Of greater importance, Oswald’s commitment\r\nto Marxism contributed to the decisions which led him to defect to the\r\nSoviet Union in 1959, and later to engage in activities on behalf of\r\nthe Fair Play for Cuba Committee in the summer of 1963, and to attempt\r\nto go to Cuba late in September of that year.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefection to the Soviet Union\r\n\r\nAfter Oswald left the Marine Corps in September of 1959, ostensibly to\r\ncare for his mother, he almost immediately left for the Soviet Union\r\nwhere he attempted to renounce his citizenship. At the age of 19,\r\nOswald thus committed an act which was the most striking indication\r\nhe had yet given of his willingness to act on his beliefs in quite\r\nextraordinary ways.\r\n\r\nWhile his defection resulted in part from Oswald’s commitment to\r\nMarxism, it appears that personal and psychological factors were also\r\ninvolved. On August 17, 1963, Oswald told Mr. William Stuckey, who\r\nhad arranged a radio debate on Oswald’s activities on behalf of the\r\nFair Play for Cuba Committee, that while he had begun to read Marx and\r\nEngels at the age of 15,\r\n\r\n    the conclusive thing that made him decide that Marxism was the\r\n    answer was his service in Japan. He said living conditions\r\n    over there convinced him something was wrong with the system,\r\n    and that possibly Marxism was the answer. He said it was\r\n    in Japan that he made up his mind to go to Russia and see\r\n    for himself how a revolutionary society operates, a Marxist\r\n    society.[C7-167]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, at least one person who knew Oswald after his return\r\nthought that his defection had a more personal and psychological\r\nbasis.[C7-168] The validity of the latter observation is borne out\r\nby some of the things Oswald wrote in connection with his defection\r\nindicating that his motivation was at least in part a personal one. On\r\nNovember 26, 1959, shortly after he arrived in the Soviet Union, and\r\nprobably before Soviet authorities had given him permission to stay\r\nindefinitely, he wrote to his brother Robert that the Soviet Union\r\nwas a country which “I have always considered * * * to be my own” and\r\nthat he went there “only to find freedom. * * * I could never have\r\nbeen personally happy in the U.S.”[C7-169] He wrote in another letter\r\nthat he would “never return to the United States which is a country I\r\nhate.”[C7-170] His idea that he was to find “freedom” in the Soviet\r\nUnion was to be rudely shattered.\r\n\r\nWhatever Oswald’s reasons for going to the Soviet Union might have\r\nbeen, however, there can be little doubt that his desire to go was\r\nquite strong. In addition to studying the Russian language while he was\r\nin the Marines, Oswald had managed to save enough money to cover the\r\nexpenses of his forthcoming trip. While there is no proof that he saved\r\n$1,500, as he claimed, it would have taken considerable discipline to\r\nsave whatever amount was required to finance his defection out of the\r\nsalary of a low ranking enlisted man.[C7-171]\r\n\r\nThe extent of Oswald’s desire to go to the Soviet Union and of his\r\ninitial commitment to that country can best be understood, however,\r\nin the context of his concomitant hatred of the United States, which\r\nwas most clearly expressed in his November 26, 1959, letter to his\r\nbrother Robert. Addressing himself to the question of why “I and my\r\nfellow workers and communist’s would like to see the present capitalist\r\ngovernment of the U.S. overthrown” Oswald stated that that government\r\nsupported an economic system “which exploits all its workers” and under\r\nwhich “art, culture and the sprit of man are subjected to commercial\r\nenterpraising, [and] religion and education are used as a tool to\r\nsurpress what would otherwise be a population questioning their\r\ngovernment’s unfair economic system and plans for war.”[C7-172]\r\n\r\nHe complained in his letter about segregation, unemployment,\r\nautomation, and the use of military forces to suppress other\r\npopulations. Asking his brother why he supported the American\r\nGovernment and what ideals he put forward, Oswald wrote:\r\n\r\n    Ask me and I will tell you I fight for _communism_. * * * I\r\n    will not say your grandchildren will live under communism, look\r\n    for yourself at history, look at a world map! America is a\r\n    dieing country, I do not wish to be a part of it, nor do I ever\r\n    again wish to be used as a tool in its military aggressions.\r\n\r\n    This should ansewer your question, and also give you a glimpse\r\n    of my way of thinking.\r\n\r\n    So you speak of advantages. Do you think that is why I am here?\r\n    For personal, material advantages? Happiness is not based on\r\n    oneself, it does not consist of a small home, of taking and\r\n    getting, Happiness is taking part in the struggle, where there\r\n    is no borderline between one’s own personal world, and the\r\n    world in general. I never believed I would find more material\r\n    advantages at _this_ stage of development in the Soviet Union\r\n    than I might of had in the U.S.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I have been a pro-communist for years and yet I have never\r\n    met a communist, instead I kept silent and observed, and what\r\n    I observed plus my Marx’ist learning brought me here to the\r\n    Soviet Union. I have always considered this country to be my\r\n    own.[C7-173]\r\n\r\nResponding to Robert’s statement that he had not “renounced” him,\r\nOswald told his brother “on what terms I want this arrangement.” He\r\nadvised Robert that:\r\n\r\n    1. In the event of war I would kill _any_ american who put a\r\n    uniform on in defence of the american government--any american.\r\n\r\n    2. That in my own mind I have no attachment’s of any kind in\r\n    the U.S.\r\n\r\n    3. That I want to, and I shall, live a normal happy and\r\n    peaceful life here in the Soviet Union _for the rest of my\r\n    life_.\r\n\r\n    4. that my mother and you are (in spite of what the newspaper\r\n    said) _not_ objects of affection, but only examples of workers\r\n    in the U.S.[C7-174]\r\n\r\nDespite this commitment to the Soviet Union Oswald met disappointments\r\nthere just as he had in the past. At the outset the Soviets told him\r\nthat he could not remain. It seems that Oswald immediately attempted\r\nsuicide--a striking indication of how much he desired to remain in the\r\nSoviet Union.[C7-175] It shows how willing he was to act dramatically\r\nand decisively when he faced an emotional crisis with few readily\r\navailable alternatives at hand. He was shocked to find that the Soviet\r\nUnion did not accept him with open arms. The entry in his self-styled\r\n“Historic Diary” for October 21, 1959, reports:\r\n\r\n    I am shocked!! My dreams! * * * I have waited for 2 year to be\r\n    accepted. My fondes dreams are shattered because of a petty\r\n    offial, * * * I decide to end it. Soak rist in cold water to\r\n    numb the pain. Than slash my leftwrist. Than plaug wrist into\r\n    bathtum of hot water. * * * Somewhere, a violin plays, as I\r\n    wacth my life whirl away. I think to myself “How easy to Die”\r\n    and “A Sweet Death, (to violins) * * *”[C7-176]\r\n\r\nOswald was discovered in time to thwart his attempt at suicide.[C7-177]\r\nHe was taken to a hospital in Moscow where he was kept until October\r\n28, 1959.[C7-178]\r\n\r\nStill intent, however, on staying in the Soviet Union, Oswald went on\r\nOctober 31, to the American Embassy to renounce his U.S. citizenship.\r\nMr. Richard E. Snyder, then Second Secretary and senior consular\r\nofficial at the Embassy, testified that Oswald was extremely sure of\r\nhimself and seemed “to know what his mission was. He took charge, in\r\na sense, of the conversation right from the beginning.”[C7-179] He\r\npresented the following signed note:\r\n\r\n    I Lee Harvey Oswald do hereby request that my present\r\n    citizenship in the United States of America, be revoked.\r\n\r\n    I have entered the Soviet Union for the express purpose of\r\n    appling for citizenship in the Soviet Union, through the means\r\n    of naturalization.\r\n\r\n    My request for citizenship is now pending before the Surprem\r\n    Soviet of the U.S.S.R..\r\n\r\n    I take these steps for political reasons. My request for the\r\n    revoking of my American citizenship is made only after the\r\n    longest and most serious considerations.\r\n\r\n    I affirm that my allegiance is to the Union of Soviet Socialist\r\n    Republics.[C7-180] (See Commission Exhibit 913, p. 261.)\r\n\r\nAs his “principal reason” for renouncing his citizenship Oswald stated:\r\n“I am a Marxist.”[C7-181] He also alluded to hardships endured by his\r\nmother as a worker, referring to them as experiences that he did not\r\nintend to have himself,[C7-182] even though he stated that he had\r\nnever held a civilian job.[C7-183] He said that his Marine service in\r\nOkinawa and elsewhere had given him “a chance to observe ‘American\r\nimperialism.’” but he also displayed some sensitivity at not having\r\nreached a higher rank in the Marine Corps.[C7-184] He stated that he\r\nhad volunteered to give Soviet officials any information that he had\r\nconcerning Marine Corps operations,[C7-185] and intimated that he might\r\nknow something of special interest.[C7-186] Oswald’s “Historic Diary”\r\ndescribes the event in part as follows:\r\n\r\n    I leave Embassy, elated at this showdown, returning to my hotel\r\n    I feel now my energies are not spent in vain. I’m sure Russians\r\n    will except me after this sign of my faith in them.[C7-187]\r\n\r\nThe Soviet authorities finally permitted Oswald to remain in their\r\ncountry.[C7-188] No evidence has been found that they used him for any\r\nparticular propaganda or other political or informational purposes.\r\nThey sent him to Minsk to work in a radio and television factory as a\r\nmetal worker.[C7-189] The Soviet authorities denied Oswald permission\r\nto attend a university in Moscow,[C7-190] but they gave him a monthly\r\nallowance of 700 rubles a month (old exchange rate)[C7-191] in\r\naddition to his factory salary of approximately equal amount[C7-192]\r\nand considerably better living quarters than those accorded to Soviet\r\ncitizens of equal age and station.[C7-193] The subsidy, apparently\r\nsimilar to those sometimes given to foreigners allowed to remain in the\r\nSoviet Union, together with his salary, gave Oswald an income which\r\nhe said approximated that of the director of the factory in which he\r\nworked.[C7-194]\r\n\r\nEven though he received more money and better living quarters than\r\nother Russians doing similar work, he envied his wife’s uncle, a\r\ncolonel in the MVD, because of the larger apartment in which he lived.\r\nReminiscent of his attitude toward his superiors in the Marine Corps,\r\nOswald apparently resented the exercise of authority over him and\r\nthe better treatment afforded to Communist Party officials.[C7-195]\r\nAfter he returned to the United States he took the position that the\r\nCommunist Party officials in the Soviet Union were opportunists who\r\nwere betraying their positions for personal gain. He is reported to\r\nhave expressed the conclusion that they had “fat stinking politicians\r\nover there just like we have over here.”[C7-196]\r\n\r\nOswald apparently continued to have personal difficulties while he was\r\nin Minsk. Although Marina Oswald told the Commission that her husband\r\nhad good personal relationships in the Soviet Union,[C7-197] Katherine\r\nFord, one of the members of the Russian community in Dallas with\r\nwhich the Oswalds became acquainted upon their arrival in the United\r\nStates, stated that Mrs. Oswald told her everybody in Russia “hated\r\nhim.”[C7-198] Jeanne De Mohrenschildt, another member of that group,\r\nsaid that Oswald told her that he had returned because “I didn’t find\r\nwhat I was looking for.”[C7-199] George De Mohrenschildt thought that\r\nOswald must have become disgusted with life in the Soviet Union as the\r\nnovelty of the presence of an American wore off and he began to be less\r\nthe center of attention.[C7-200]\r\n\r\nThe best description of Oswald’s state of mind, however, is set forth\r\nin his own “Historic Diary.” Under the entry for May 1, 1960, he noted\r\nthat one of his acquaintances “relats many things I do not know about\r\nthe U.S.S.R. I begin to feel uneasy inside, its true!”[C7-201] Under\r\nthe entry for August-September of that year he wrote:\r\n\r\n    As my Russian improves I become increasingly concious of just\r\n    what sort of a sociaty I live in. Mass gymnastics, complusory\r\n    afterwork meeting, usually political information meeting.\r\n    Complusory attendence at lectures and the sending of the entire\r\n    shop collective (except me) to pick potatoes on a Sunday, at\r\n    a state collective farm: A “patroict duty” to bring in the\r\n    harvest. The opions of the workers (unvoiced) are that its\r\n    a great pain in the neck: they don’t seem to be esspicialy\r\n    enthusiastic about any of the “collective” duties a natural\r\n    feeling. I am increasingly aware of the presence, in all thing,\r\n    of Lebizen, shop party secretary, fat, fortyish, and jovial on\r\n    the outside. He is a no-nonsense party regular.[C7-202]\r\n\r\nFinally, the entry of January 4-31 of 1961:\r\n\r\n    I am stating to reconsider my disire about staying the work is\r\n    drab the money I get has nowhere to be spent. No night clubs\r\n    or bowling allys no places of recreation acept the trade union\r\n    dances I have have had enough.[C7-203]\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter, less than 18 months after his defection, about 6\r\nweeks before he met Marina Prusakova, Oswald opened negotiations with\r\nthe U.S. Embassy in Moscow looking toward his return to the United\r\nStates.[C7-204]\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn to the United States\r\n\r\nIn view of the intensity of his earlier commitment to the Soviet Union,\r\na great change must have occurred in Oswald’s thinking to induce him to\r\nreturn to the United States. The psychological effects of that change\r\nmust have been highly unsettling. It should be remembered that he was\r\nnot yet 20 years old when he went to the Soviet Union with such high\r\nhopes and not quite 23 when he returned bitterly disappointed. His\r\nattempt to renounce his citizenship had been an open expression of\r\nhostility against the United States and a profound rejection of his\r\nearly life. The dramatic break with society in America now had to be\r\nundone. His return to the United States publicly testified to the utter\r\nfailure of what had been the most important act of his life.\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald confirmed the fact that her husband was experiencing\r\npsychological difficulties at the time of his return. She said that\r\n“immediately after coming to the United States Lee changed. I did not\r\nknow him as such a man in Russia.”[C7-205] She added that while he\r\nhelped her as he had done before, he became more of a recluse, that\r\n“[he] was very irritable, sometimes for a trifle” and that “Lee was\r\nvery unrestrained and very explosive” during the period from November\r\n19, 1962 to March of 1963.[C7-206]\r\n\r\nAfter the assassination she wrote that:\r\n\r\n    In general, our family life began to deteriorate after we\r\n    arrived in America. Lee was always hot-tempered, and now this\r\n    trait of character more and more prevented us from living\r\n    together in harmony. Lee became very irritable, and sometimes\r\n    some completely trivial thing would drive him into a rage. I\r\n    myself do not have a particularly quiet disposition, but I had\r\n    to change my character a great deal in order to maintain a more\r\n    or less peaceful family life.[C7-207]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald’s judgment of her husband’s state of mind may be\r\nsubstantiated by comparing material which he wrote in the Soviet Union\r\nwith what he wrote while on the way back to the United States and after\r\nhis return. While in the Soviet Union he wrote his longest and clearest\r\npiece of work, “The Collective.” This was a fairly coherent description\r\nof life in that country, basically centered around the radio and\r\ntelevision factory in which he worked.[C7-208] While it was apparently\r\nintended for publication in the United States, and is in many respects\r\ncritical of certain aspects of life in the Soviet Union, it appears\r\nto be the work of a fairly well organized person. Oswald prefaced his\r\nmanuscript with a short autobiographical sketch which reads in part as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Lee Harvey Oswald was born in Oct 1939 in New Orleans La. the\r\n    son of a Insuraen Salesmen whose early death left a far mean\r\n    streak of indepence brought on by negleck. entering the US\r\n    Marine corp at 17 this streak of independence was strengthed by\r\n    exotic journeys to Japan the Philipines and the scores of odd\r\n    Islands in the Pacific immianly after serving out his 3 years\r\n    in the USMC he abonded his american life to seek a new life\r\n    in the USSR. full of optimism and hope he stood in red square\r\n    in the fall of 1959 vowing to see his chosen course through,\r\n    after, however, two years and alot of growing up I decided to\r\n    return to the USA. * * *[C7-209]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPHS OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD TAKEN IN MINSK\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT 2891\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT 2892\r\n\r\n(COMMISSION EXHIBIT 2788)\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPH OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD TAKEN AFTER HIS RETURN FROM THE SOVIET\r\nUNION]\r\n\r\n“The Collective” contrasts sharply with material which Oswald seems\r\nto have written after he left the Soviet Union,[C7-210] which appears\r\nto be more an expression of his own psychological condition than of a\r\nreasoned analysis. The latter material expresses great hostility to\r\nboth communism and capitalism. He wrote, that to a person knowing both\r\nof those systems, “their can be no mediation between those systems as\r\nthey exist to-day and that person. He must be opposed to their basic\r\nfoundations and representatives”[C7-211]\r\n\r\n    and yet it is imature to take the sort of attitude which\r\n    says “a curse on both your houses!” their are two great\r\n    represenative of power in the world, simply expressed, the left\r\n    and right, and their ~offspring~ factions and concers. any\r\n    practical attempt at one alternative must have as its nuclus\r\n    the triditionall ideological best of both systems, and yet be\r\n    utterly opposed to both systems.[C7-212]\r\n\r\nSuch an alternative was to be opposed both to capitalism and communism\r\nbecause:\r\n\r\n    No man, having known, having lived, under the Russian Communist\r\n    and American capitalist system, could possibly make a choice\r\n    between them, there is no choice, one offers oppresstion the\r\n    other poverty. Both offer imperilistic injustice, tinted with\r\n    two brands of slavery.[C7-213]\r\n\r\nOswald actually did attempt to formulate such an alternative[C7-214]\r\nwhich he planned to “put forward” himself.[C7-215] He thought the\r\nnew alternative would have its best chance to be accepted after\r\n“conflict between the two world systems leaves the ~world~ country\r\nwithout defense or foundation of goverment,”[C7-216] after which the\r\nsurvivors would “seek a alturnative ~opposed~ to those systems which\r\nhave brough them misery.”[C7-217] Oswald realized that “their thinking\r\nand education will be steeped in the traiditions of those systems\r\n[and] they would never except a ‘new order’ complete beyond their\r\nunderstanding.”[C7-218] As a result he thought it would be “neccary\r\nto oppose the old systems but at the same time support their cherised\r\ntrations.”[C7-219]\r\n\r\nExpanding on his ideas on how his alternative to communism and\r\ncapitalism might be introduced, he wrote of a “readily foreseeable\r\n* * * economic, political or military crisis, internal or external,\r\n[which] will bring about the final destrution of the capitalist\r\nsystem,”[C7-220] and indicated that “preparation in a special\r\nparty could safeguard an independant course of action after the\r\ndebacle,”[C7-221] which would achieve the goal, which was:\r\n\r\n    The emplacement of a separate, democratic, pure communist\r\n    sociaty * * * but one with union-communes, democratic\r\n    socializing of production and without regard to the twisting\r\n    apart of ~Marxism~ Marxist Communism by other powers.[C7-222]\r\n\r\nWhile “[r]esoufualniss and patient working towards the aforesaid\r\ngoal’s are prefered rather than loud and useless manifestation’s of\r\nprotest,”[C7-223] Oswald went on to note:\r\n\r\n    But these prefered tactics now, may prove to be too limited in\r\n    the near future, they should not be confused with slowness,\r\n    indesision or fear, only the intellectualy fearless could even\r\n    be remotly attracted too our doctrine, and yet this doctrine\r\n    requirers the ~uptmost~ utmost restraint, a state of being in\r\n    itself majustic in power.[C7-224]\r\n\r\nOswald’s decided rejection of both capitalism and communism seemed to\r\nplace him in a situation in which he could not live with satisfaction\r\neither in the United States or in the Soviet Union. The discussion\r\nabove has already set forth examples of his expression of hatred for\r\nthe United States. He also expressed hatred of the Soviet Union and\r\nof the Communist Party, U.S.A., even though he later referred to the\r\nlatter as “trusted long time fighters for progress.”[C7-225] He wrote:\r\n\r\n    The Communist Party of the United States has betrayed itself!\r\n\r\n    it has turned itself into the tradional lever of a foreign\r\n    power to overthrow the goverment of the United States; not in\r\n    the name of freedow or high ideals, but in servile conformity\r\n    to the wishes of the Soviet Union and in anticipation of Soviet\r\n    Russia’s complete domination of the American continent.[C7-226]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    There can be no sympathy for those who have turned the idea of\r\n    communism into a vill curse to western man.\r\n\r\n    The Soviets have committed crimes unsurpassed even by their\r\n    early day capitalist counterparts, the imprisonment of their\r\n    own peoples, with the mass extermination so typical of Stalin,\r\n    and the individual surpresstion and regimentation under\r\n    Krushchev.\r\n\r\n    The deportations, the purposefull curtailment of diet in the\r\n    consumer slighted population of Russia, the murder of history,\r\n    the prositution of art and culture.[C7-227]\r\n\r\nA suggestion that Oswald hated more than just capitalism and communism\r\nis provided by the following, which was apparently written either on\r\nthe ship coming back, or after his return from the Soviet Union:\r\n\r\n    I have offen wondered why it is that the communist, ~anarchist~\r\n    capitatist and even the fasist and anarchist elements in\r\n    american, allways profess patrotistism toward the land and the\r\n    people, if not the goverment; although their ~ideals~ movements\r\n    must surly lead to the bitter destruction of all and everything.\r\n\r\n    I am quite sure these people must hate not only the goverment\r\n    but ~our~ the ~peop~ culture, ~traditions,~ heritage and very\r\n    people itself, and yet they stand up and piously pronouce\r\n    themselfs patriots, displaying their war medles, that they\r\n    gained in conflicts ~long-past~ between themselfs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I wonder what would happen it somebody was to stand up and say\r\n    he was utterly opposed not only to the goverments, but to the\r\n    people, too the entire land and complete foundations of his\r\n    socically.[C7-228]\r\n\r\nOswald demonstrated his thinking in connection with his return to the\r\nUnited States by preparing two sets of identical questions of the type\r\nwhich he might have thought he would be asked at a press conference\r\nwhen he returned. With either great ambivalence or cold calculation he\r\nprepared completely different answers to the same questions. Judged\r\nby his other statements and writings, however, he appears to have\r\nindicated his true feelings in the set of answers first presented and\r\nto have stated in the second what he thought would be least harmful\r\nto him as he resumed life in the United States. For example, in\r\nresponse to his questions about his decision to go to the Soviet Union,\r\nhis first draft answered “as a mark of dicuss and protest against\r\namerican political policies in foriengn countrys, my personal sign of\r\ndiscontent and horror at the misguided line of resoning of the U.S.\r\nGoverment.”[C7-229] His second answer was that he “went as a citizen of\r\nthe U.S. (as a tourist) residing in a forieng conutry which I have a\r\nperfect right to do. I went there to see the land, the people and how\r\ntheir system works.”[C7-230]\r\n\r\nTo the question of “Are you a communits?” he first answered “Yes,\r\nbasically, allthough I hate the USSR and socialist system I still\r\n_think_ marxism can work under different circumstances.”[C7-231] His\r\nsecond answer to this question was, “No of course not, I have never\r\neven know a communist, outside of the ones in the USSR but you can’t\r\nhelp that.”[C7-232] His first set of questions and answers indicated\r\nhis belief that there were no outstanding differences between the\r\nSoviet Union and the United States, “except in the US. the living\r\nstandard is a little higher, freedoms are about the same, medical\r\naid and the educational system in the USSR is better than in the\r\nUSA.”[C7-233] In the second simulated transcript which ended with the\r\nstatement “Newspapers, thank you sir; you are a _real_ patriot!!” he\r\napparently concluded that the United States offered “freedom of speech\r\ntravel outspoken opposition to unpopular policies freedom to believe in\r\ngod,” while the Soviet Union did not.[C7-234]\r\n\r\nDespite the hatred that Oswald expressed toward the Soviet Union after\r\nhis residence there, he continued to be interested in that country\r\nafter he returned to the United States. Soon after his arrival he\r\nwrote to the Soviet Embassy in Washington requesting information on\r\nhow to subscribe to Russian newspapers and magazines and asked for\r\n“any periodicals or bulletins which you may put out for the beneifit\r\nof your citizens living, for a time, in the U.S.A..”[C7-235] Oswald\r\nsubsequently did subscribe to several Soviet journals.[C7-236] While\r\nMarina Oswald tried to obtain permission to return to the Soviet Union\r\nshe testified that she did so at her husband’s insistence.[C7-237]\r\n\r\nIn July of 1963, Oswald also requested the Soviet Union to provide a\r\nvisa for his return to that country.[C7-238] In August of 1963, he\r\ngave the New Orleans police as a reason for refusing to permit his\r\nfamily to learn English, that “he hated America and he did not want\r\nthem to become ‘Americanized’ and that his plans were to go back to\r\nRussia.”[C7-239] Even though his primary purpose probably was to get to\r\nCuba, he sought an immediate grant of visa on his trip to Mexico City\r\nin late September of 1963.[C7-240] He also inquired about visas for\r\nhimself and his wife in a letter which he wrote to the Soviet Embassy\r\nin Washington on November 9, 1963.[C7-241]\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal Relations\r\n\r\nApart from his relatives, Oswald had no friends or close associates\r\nin Texas when he returned there in June of 1962, and he did not\r\nestablish any close friendships or associations, although it appears\r\nthat he came to respect George De Mohrenschildt.[C7-242] Somewhat of a\r\nnonconformist,[C7-243] De Mohrenschildt was a peripheral member of the\r\nso-called Russian community, with which Oswald made contact through Mr.\r\nPeter Gregory, a Russian-speaking petroleum engineer whom Oswald met as\r\na result of his contact with the Texas Employment Commission office in\r\nFort Worth.[C7-244] Some of the members of that group saw a good deal\r\nof the Oswalds through the fall of 1963, and attempted to help Mrs.\r\nOswald particularly, in various ways.[C7-245] In general, Oswald did\r\nnot like the members of the Russian community.[C7-246] In fact, his\r\nrelations with some of them, particularly George Bouhe, became quite\r\nhostile.[C7-247] Part of the problem resulted from the fact that, as\r\nJeanne De Mohrenschildt testified, Oswald was “very, very disagreeable\r\nand disappointed.”[C7-248] He also expressed considerable resentment at\r\nthe help given to his wife by her Russian-American friends. Jeanne De\r\nMohrenschildt said:\r\n\r\n     Marina had a hundred dresses given to her * * * [and] he\r\n    objected to that lavish help, because Marina was throwing it\r\n    into his face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    He was offensive with the people. And I can understand why, *\r\n    * * because that hurt him. He could never give her what the\r\n    people were showering on her. * * * no matter how hard he\r\n    worked--and he worked very hard.[C7-249]\r\n\r\nThe relations between Oswald and his wife became such that Bouhe wanted\r\nto “liberate” her from Oswald.[C7-250] While the exact sequence of\r\nevents is not clear because of conflicting testimony, it appears that\r\nDe Mohrenschildt and his wife actually went to Oswald’s apartment early\r\nin November of 1962 and helped to move the personal effects of Marina\r\nOswald and the baby. Even though it appears that they may have left\r\nOswald a few days before, it seems that he resisted the move as best\r\nhe could. He even threatened to tear up his wife’s dresses and break\r\nall the baby things. According to De Mohrenschildt, Oswald submitted to\r\nthe inevitable, presumably because he was “small, you know, and he was\r\nrather a puny individual.”[C7-251] De Mohrenschildt said that the whole\r\naffair made him nervous since he was “interfering in other people’s\r\naffairs, after all.”[C7-252]\r\n\r\nOswald attempted to get his wife to come back and, over Bouhe’s\r\nprotest, De Mohrenschildt finally told him where she was. De\r\nMohrenschildt admitted that:\r\n\r\n    if somebody did that to me, a lousy trick like that, to take my\r\n    wife away, and all the furniture, I would be mad as hell, too.\r\n    I am surprised that he didn’t do something worse.[C7-253]\r\n\r\nAfter about a 2-week separation, Marina Oswald returned to her\r\nhusband.[C7-254] Bouhe thoroughly disapproved of this and as a result\r\nalmost all communication between the Oswalds and members of the Russian\r\ncommunity ceased. Contacts with De Mohrenschildt and his wife did\r\ncontinue and they saw the Oswalds occasionally until the spring of\r\n1963.[C7-255]\r\n\r\nShortly after his return from the Soviet Union, Oswald severed all\r\nrelations with his mother; he did not see his brother Robert from\r\nThanksgiving of 1962 until November 23, 1963.[C7-256] At the time of\r\nhis defection, Oswald had said that neither his brother, Robert, nor\r\nhis mother were objects of his affection, “but only examples of workers\r\nin the U.S.” He also indicated to officials at the American Embassy in\r\nMoscow that his defection was motivated at least in part by so-called\r\nexploitation of his mother by the capitalist system.[C7-257] Consistent\r\nwith this attitude he first told his wife that he did not have a\r\nmother, but later admitted that he did but that “he didn’t love her\r\nvery much.”[C7-258]\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived from the Soviet Union, Oswald and his family lived\r\nat first with his brother Robert. The latter testified that they “were\r\njust together again,” as if his brother “had not been to Russia.” He\r\nalso said that he and his family got along well with Marina Oswald and\r\nenjoyed showing her American things.[C7-259] After about a month with\r\nhis brother, Oswald and his family lived for a brief period with his\r\nmother at her urging, but Oswald soon decided to move out.[C7-260]\r\n\r\nMarguerite Oswald visited her son and his family at the first apartment\r\nwhich he rented after his return, and tried to help them get settled\r\nthere. After she had bought some clothes for Marina Oswald and a\r\nhighchair for the baby, Oswald emphatically told her to stop. As\r\nMarguerite Oswald testified, “he strongly put me in my place about\r\nbuying things for his wife that he himself could not buy.”[C7-261]\r\nOswald objected to his mother visiting the apartment and became quite\r\nincensed with his wife when she would open the door for her in spite\r\nof his instructions to the contrary.[C7-262] Oswald moved to Dallas on\r\nabout October 8, 1962, without telling his mother where he was going.\r\nHe never saw or communicated with her in any way again until she came\r\nto see him after the assassination.[C7-263]\r\n\r\nEven though Oswald cut off relations with his mother, he attempted for\r\nthe first time to learn something about his family background when he\r\nwent to New Orleans in April of 1963. He visited some of his father’s\r\nelderly relatives and the cemetery where his father was buried in an\r\neffort to develop the facts of his genealogy.[C7-264] While it does not\r\nappear that he established any new relationships as a result of his\r\ninvestigation, he did obtain a large picture of his father from one of\r\nthe elderly relatives with whom he spoke.[C7-265] Oswald’s interest in\r\nsuch things presents a sharp contrast with his attitude at the time of\r\nhis defection, when he evidenced no interest in his father and hardly\r\nmentioned him, even when questioned.[C7-266]\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployment\r\n\r\nOswald’s defection, his interest in the Soviet Union, and his\r\nactivities on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee not only\r\ncaused him difficulties in his employment relations, but they also\r\nprovided him with excuses for employment failures which were largely of\r\nhis own making. Oswald experienced some difficulty finding employment.\r\nPerhaps this was partially because of his lack of any specific skill or\r\ntraining.[C7-267] Some of his acquaintances, feeling that Oswald tried\r\nto impress people with the fact that he had lived and worked in Russia,\r\nwere led to the belief that his employment difficulties were caused by\r\nhis telling prospective employers that he had last been employed in\r\nMinsk.[C7-268] While he might have expected difficulty from such an\r\napproach, in fact the evidence indicates that Oswald usually told his\r\nprospective employers and employment counselors that he had recently\r\nbeen discharged from the Marine Corps.[C7-269]\r\n\r\nOswald obtained a job in July of 1962 as a sheet metal worker with\r\na company in Fort Worth. His performance for that company was\r\nsatisfactory.[C7-270] Even though he told his wife that he had\r\nbeen fired, he voluntarily left on October 8, 1962, and moved to\r\nDallas.[C7-271]\r\n\r\nOn October 9, 1962 he went to the Dallas office of the Texas Employment\r\nCommission where he expressed a reluctance to work in the industrial\r\nfield.[C7-272] He indicated an interest in writing. An employment\r\ncounselor testified, on the basis of a general aptitude test Oswald\r\nhad taken, that he had some aptitude in that area, “because the verbal\r\nscore is high and the clerical score is high.”[C7-273] While that\r\ncounselor found that he was qualified to handle many different types\r\nof jobs, because of his need for immediate employment she attempted\r\nto obtain for him any job that was available at the time. Oswald\r\nmade qualifying marks in 19 of 23 categories included on the general\r\naptitude examination and scored 127 on the verbal test, as compared\r\nwith 50 percent of the people taking it who score less than 100. The\r\ncounselor testified that there was some indication that Oswald was\r\ncapable of doing college work and noted that Oswald’s verbal and\r\nclerical potential was “outstanding.”[C7-274] Employment Commission\r\nrecords concerning Oswald stated: “Well-groomed & spoken, business\r\nsuit, alert replies--Expresses self extremely well.”[C7-275] Oswald\r\nsaid that he hoped eventually to develop qualifications for employment\r\nas a junior executive through a work-study program at a local college.\r\nHe indicated, however, that he would have to delay that program because\r\nof his immediate financial needs and responsibilities.[C7-276]\r\n\r\nOn October 11, 1962, the Employment Commission referred Oswald to a\r\ncommercial advertising photography firm in Dallas,[C7-277] where he\r\nwas employed as a trainee starting October 12, 1962.[C7-278] Even\r\nthough Oswald indicated that he liked photographic work,[C7-279] his\r\nemployer found that he was not an efficient worker. He was not able\r\nto produce photographic work which adhered with sufficient precision\r\nto the job specifications and as a result too much of his work had to\r\nbe redone.[C7-280] He also had difficulty in working with the other\r\nemployees. This was at least in part because of the close physical\r\nconfines in which some of the work had to be done.[C7-281] He did not\r\nseem to be able to make the accommodations necessary when people work\r\nunder such conditions and as a result became involved in conflicts,\r\nsome of which were fairly heated, with his fellow employees.[C7-282]\r\n\r\nIn February or March of 1963, it began to appear that Oswald was having\r\nconsiderable difficulty doing accurate work and in getting along with\r\nthe other employees. It appears that his discharge was hastened by the\r\nfact that he brought a Russian language newspaper to work.[C7-283] It\r\nis not possible to tell whether Oswald did this to provide an excuse\r\nfor his eventual discharge, or whether he brought the Russian language\r\nnewspaper with him one day after his other difficulties became clear.\r\nIt is possible that his immediate supervisor noticed the newspaper at\r\nthat time because his attention had otherwise been drawn more directly\r\nto Oswald. In any event, Oswald was discharged on April 6, 1963,\r\nostensibly because of his inefficiency and difficult personality. His\r\nsupervisor admitted, however, that while he did not fire Oswald because\r\nof the newspaper incident or even weigh it heavily in his decision,\r\n“it didn’t do his case any good.”[C7-284]\r\n\r\nUpon moving to New Orleans on April 24, 1963, Oswald’s employment\r\nproblems became more difficult. He left his wife and child at the\r\nhome of a friend, Mrs. Ruth Paine, of Irving, Tex.[C7-285] In New\r\nOrleans he obtained work as a greaser and oiler of coffee processing\r\nmachines for the William B. Reily Co., beginning May 10, 1963.[C7-286]\r\nAfter securing this job and an apartment, Oswald asked his wife to\r\njoin him. Mrs. Paine brought Oswald’s family to New Orleans.[C7-287]\r\nRefusing to admit that he could only get work as a greaser, Oswald\r\ntold his wife and Mrs. Paine that he was working as a commercial\r\nphotographer.[C7-288] He lost his job on July 19, 1963, because his\r\nwork was not satisfactory[C7-289] and because he spent too much time\r\nloitering in the garage next door, where he read rifle and hunting\r\nmagazines.[C7-290] Oswald apparently concluded that his Fair Play for\r\nCuba Committee activities were not related to his discharge.[C7-291]\r\nThe correctness of that conclusion is supported by the fact that he\r\ndoes not seem to have been publicly identified with that organization\r\nuntil August 9, 1963, almost a month after he lost his job.[C7-292]\r\n\r\nHis Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities, however, made it more\r\ndifficult for him to obtain other employment. A placement interviewer\r\nof the Louisiana Department of Labor who had previously interviewed\r\nOswald, saw him on television and heard a radio debate in which he\r\nengaged on August 21, 1963. He consulted with his supervisor and “it\r\nwas determined that we should not undertake to furnish employment\r\nreferences for him.”[C7-293] Ironically, he failed to get a job in\r\nanother photographic firm after his return to Dallas in October of\r\n1963, because the president of the photographic firm for which he\r\nhad previously worked told the prospective employer that Oswald was\r\n“kinda peculiar sometimes and that he had some knowledge of the Russian\r\nlanguage,” and that he “may be a damn Communist. I can’t tell you.\r\nIf I was you, I wouldn’t hire him.”[C7-294] The plant superintendent\r\nof the new firm testified that one of the employees of the old firm\r\n“implied that Oswald’s fellow employees did not like him because he was\r\npropagandizing and had been seen reading a foreign newspaper.” As a\r\nresult Oswald was not hired.[C7-295] He subsequently found a job with\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository for which he performed his duties\r\nsatisfactorily.[C7-296]\r\n\r\n\r\nAttack on General Walker\r\n\r\nThe Commission has concluded that on April 10, 1963, Oswald shot\r\nat Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker (Resigned, U.S. Army), demonstrating\r\nonce again his propensity to act dramatically and, in this instance\r\nviolently, in furtherance of his beliefs. The shooting occurred 2\r\nweeks before Oswald moved to New Orleans and a few days after he had\r\nbeen discharged by the photographic firm. As indicated in chapter IV,\r\nOswald had been planning his attack on General Walker for at least\r\n1[C7-297] and perhaps as much as 2 months.[C7-298] He outlined his\r\nplans in a notebook and studied them at considerable length before\r\nhis attack.[C7-299] He also studied Dallas bus schedules to prepare\r\nfor his later use of buses to travel to and from General Walker’s\r\nhouse.[C7-300] Sometime after March 27, but according to Marina Oswald,\r\nprior to April 10, 1963,[C7-301] Oswald posed for two pictures with his\r\nrecently acquired rifle and pistol, a copy of the March 24, 1963, issue\r\nof the Worker, and the March 11, 1963, issue of the Militant.[C7-302]\r\nHe told his wife that he wanted to send the pictures to the Militant\r\nand he also asked her to keep one of the pictures for his daughter,\r\nJune.[C7-303]\r\n\r\nFollowing his unsuccessful attack on Walker, Oswald returned home.\r\nHe had left a note for his wife telling her what to do in case he\r\nwere apprehended, as well as his notebook and the pictures of himself\r\nholding the rifle.[C7-304] She testified that she was agitated\r\nbecause she had found the note in Oswald’s room, where she had gone,\r\ncontrary to his instructions, after she became worried about his\r\nabsence.[C7-305] She indicated that she had no advance knowledge of\r\nOswald’s plans, that she became quite angry when Oswald told her what\r\nhe had done, and that she made him promise never to repeat such a\r\nperformance. She said that she kept the note to use against him “if\r\nsomething like that should be repeated again.”[C7-306] When asked if\r\nOswald requested the note back she testified that:\r\n\r\n    He forgot about it. But apparently after he thought that what\r\n    he had written in his book might be proof against him, and he\r\n    destroyed it. [the book][C7-307]\r\n\r\nShe later gave the following testimony [*indicates that the witness\r\nanswered without using the interpreter]:\r\n\r\n    Q. After he brought the rifle home, then, he showed you the\r\n    book?\r\n\r\n    *A. Yes.\r\n\r\n    Q. And you said it was not a good idea to keep this book?\r\n\r\n    *A. Yes.\r\n\r\n    Q. And then he burned the book?\r\n\r\n    *A. Yes.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you ask him why he had not destroyed the book before he\r\n    actually went to shoot General Walker?\r\n\r\n    A. It never came to me, myself, to ask him that\r\n    question.[C7-308]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald’s testimony indicates that her husband was not\r\nparticularly concerned about his continued possession of the most\r\nincriminating sort of evidence.[C7-309] If he had been successful and\r\nhad been apprehended even for routine questioning, his apartment would\r\nundoubtedly have been searched, and his role would have been made clear\r\nby the evidence which he had left behind. Leaving the note and picture\r\nas he did would seem to indicate that he had considered the possibility\r\nof capture. Possibly he might have wanted to be caught, and wanted his\r\ninvolvement made clear if he was in fact apprehended. Even after his\r\nwife told him to destroy the notebook he removed at least some of the\r\npictures which had been pasted in it and saved them among his effects,\r\nwhere they were found after the assassination.[C7-310] His behavior was\r\nentirely consistent with his wife’s testimony that:\r\n\r\n    I asked him what for he was making all these entries in the\r\n    book and he answered that he wanted to leave a complete record\r\n    so that all the details would be in it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I am guessing that perhaps he did it to appear to be a brave\r\n    man in case he were arrested, but that is my supposition * *\r\n    *[C7-311]\r\n\r\nThe attempt on General Walker’s life deserves close attention in any\r\nconsideration of Oswald’s possible motive for the assassination and\r\nthe trail of evidence he left behind him on that occasion. While there\r\nare differences between the two events as far as Oswald’s actions\r\nand planning are concerned, there are also similarities that should\r\nbe considered. The items which Oswald left at home when he made his\r\nattack on Walker suggest a strong concern for his place in history.\r\nIf the attack had succeeded and Oswald had been caught, the pictures\r\nshowing him with his rifle and his Communist and Socialist Worker’s\r\nParty newspapers would probably have appeared on the front pages of\r\nnewspapers or magazines all over the country, as, in fact, one of\r\nthem did appear after the assassination.[C7-312] The circumstances of\r\nthe attack on Walker coupled with other indications that Oswald was\r\nconcerned about his place in history[C7-313] and with the circumstances\r\nsurrounding the assassination, have led the Commission to believe that\r\nsuch concern is an important factor to consider in assessing possible\r\nmotivation for the assassination.\r\n\r\nIn any event, the Walker incident indicates that in spite of the belief\r\namong those who knew him that he was apparently not dangerous,[C7-314]\r\nOswald did not lack the determination and other traits required to\r\ncarry out a carefully planned killing of another human being and was\r\nwilling to consummate such a purpose if he thought there was sufficient\r\nreason to do so. Some idea of what he thought was sufficient reason for\r\nsuch an act may be found in the nature of the motive that he stated for\r\nhis attack on General Walker. Marina Oswald indicated that her husband\r\nhad compared General Walker to Adolph Hitler. She testified that Oswald\r\nsaid that General Walker “was a very bad man, that he was a fascist,\r\nthat he was the leader of a fascist organization, and when I said that\r\neven though all of that might be true, just the same he had no right to\r\ntake his life, he said if someone had killed Hitler in time it would\r\nhave saved many lives.”[C7-315]\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical Activities\r\n\r\nOswald’s political activities after his return to the United States\r\ncenter around his interest in Cuba and in the Fair Play for Cuba\r\nCommittee. Although, as indicated above, the Commission has been\r\nunable to find any credible evidence that he was involved in any\r\nconspiracy, his political activities do provide insight into certain\r\naspects of Oswald’s character and into his possible motivation for\r\nthe assassination. While it appears that he may have distributed\r\nFair Play for Cuba Committee materials on one uneventful occasion in\r\nDallas sometime during the period April 6-24, 1963,[C7-316] Oswald’s\r\nfirst public identification with that cause was in New Orleans. There,\r\nin late May and early June of 1963, under the name Lee Osborne, he\r\nhad printed a handbill headed in large letters “Hands Off Cuba,” an\r\napplication form for, and a membership card in, the New Orleans branch\r\nof the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.[C7-317] He first distributed\r\nhis handbills and other material uneventfully in the vicinity of\r\nthe U.S.S. _Wasp_, which was berthed at the Dumaine Street wharf in\r\nNew Orleans, on June 16, 1963.[C7-318] He distributed literature in\r\ndowntown New Orleans on August 9, 1963, and was arrested because of a\r\ndispute with three anti-Castro Cuban exiles, and again on August 16,\r\n1963.[C7-319] Following his arrest, he was interviewed by the police,\r\nand at his own request, by an agent of the FBI.[C7-320] On August 17,\r\n1963, he appeared briefly on a radio program[C7-321] and on August 21,\r\n1963, he debated over radio station WDSU, New Orleans, with Carlos\r\nBringuier, one of the Cuban exiles who had been arrested with him on\r\nAugust 9.[C7-322] Bringuier claimed that on August 5, 1963, Oswald had\r\nattempted to infiltrate an anti-Castro organization with which he was\r\nassociated.[C7-323]\r\n\r\nWhile Oswald publicly engaged in the activities described above, his\r\n“organization” was a product of his imagination.[C7-324] The imaginary\r\npresident of the nonexistent chapter was named A. J. Hidell,[C7-325]\r\nthe name that Oswald used when he purchased the assassination\r\nweapon.[C7-326] Marina Oswald said she signed that name, apparently\r\nchosen because it rhymed with “Fidel,”[C7-327] to her husband’s\r\nmembership card in the New Orleans chapter. She testified that he\r\nthreatened to beat her if she did not do so.[C7-328] The chapter had\r\nnever been chartered by the national FPCC organization.[C7-329] It\r\nappears to have been a solitary operation on Oswald’s part in spite of\r\nhis misstatements to the New Orleans police that it had 35 members,\r\n5 of which were usually present at meetings which were held once a\r\nmonth.[C7-330]\r\n\r\nOswald’s Fair Play for Cuba activities may be viewed as a very\r\nshrewd political operation in which one man single handedly created\r\npublicity for his cause or for himself. It is also evidence of Oswald’s\r\nreluctance to describe events accurately and of his need to present\r\nhimself to others as well as to himself in a light more favorable\r\nthan was justified by reality. This is suggested by his misleading\r\nand sometime untruthful statements in his letters to Mr. V. T. Lee,\r\nthen national director of FPCC. In one of those letters, dated August\r\n1, 1963, Oswald wrote that an office which he had previously claimed\r\nto have rented for FPCC activities had been “promply closed 3 days\r\nlater for some obsure reasons by the renters, they said something\r\nabout remodeling ect., I’m sure you understand.”[C7-331] He wrote that\r\n“thousands of circulars were distrubed”[C7-332] and that he continued\r\nto receive inquiries through his post office box which he endeavored\r\n“to keep ansewering to the best of my ability.”[C7-333] In his letter\r\nto V. T. Lee, he stated that he was then alone in his efforts on behalf\r\nof FPCC, but he attributed his lack of support to an attack by Cuban\r\nexiles in a street demonstration and being “officialy cautioned” by\r\nthe police, events which “robbed me of what support I had leaving me\r\nalone.”[C7-334]\r\n\r\nIn spite of those claims, the Commission has not been able to uncover\r\nany evidence that anyone ever attacked any street demonstration in\r\nwhich Oswald was involved, except for the Bringuier incident mentioned\r\nabove, which occurred 8 days after Oswald wrote the above letter to\r\nV. T. Lee.[C7-335] Bringuier, who seemed to be familiar with many\r\nanti-Castro activities in New Orleans, was not aware of any such\r\nincident.[C7-336] Police reports also fail to reflect any activity\r\non Oswald’s part prior to August 9, 1963, except for the uneventful\r\ndistribution of literature at the Dumaine Street wharf in June.[C7-337]\r\nFurthermore, the general tenor of Oswald’s next letter to V. T. Lee,\r\nin which he supported his report on the Bringuier incident with a copy\r\nof the charges made against him and a newspaper clipping reporting\r\nthe event, suggests that his previous story of an attack by Cuban\r\nexiles was at least greatly exaggerated.[C7-338] While the legend\r\n“FPCC 544 Camp St. NEW ORLEANS, LA.” was stamped on some literature\r\nthat Oswald had in his possession at the time of his arrest in New\r\nOrleans, extensive investigation was not able to connect Oswald with\r\nthat address, although it did develop the fact that an anti-Castro\r\norganization had maintained offices there for a period ending early\r\nin 1962.[C7-339] The Commission has not been able to find any other\r\nindication that Oswald had rented an office in New Orleans. In view of\r\nthe limited amount of public activity on Oswald’s part before August\r\n9, 1963, there also seems to be no basis for his claim that he had\r\ndistributed “thousands” of circulars, especially since he had claimed\r\nto have printed only 2,000 and actually had only 1,000 printed. In\r\naddition, there is no evidence that he received any substantial amount\r\nof materials from the national headquarters.[C7-340]\r\n\r\nIn another letter to V. T. Lee, dated August 17, 1963, Oswald wrote\r\nthat he had appeared on Mr. William Stuckey’s 15-minute television\r\nprogram over WDSU-TV called “Latin American Focus” as a result of\r\nwhich he was “flooded with callers and invitations to debate’s ect.\r\nas well as people interested in joining the F.P.C.C. New Orleans\r\nbranch.”[C7-341] WDSU has no program of any kind called “Latin American\r\nFocus.”[C7-342] Stuckey had a radio program called “Latin Listening\r\nPost,” on which Oswald was heard for less than 5 minutes on August 17,\r\n1963.[C7-343] It appears that Oswald had only one caller in response to\r\nall of his FPCC activities, an agent of Bringuier’s attempting to learn\r\nmore about the true nature of the alleged FPCC “organization” in New\r\nOrleans.[C7-344]\r\n\r\nOswald’s statements suggest that he hoped to be flooded with callers\r\nand invitations to debate. This would have made him a real center of\r\nattention as he must have been when he first arrived in the Soviet\r\nUnion and as he was to some extent when he returned to the United\r\nStates. The limited notoriety that Oswald received as a result of the\r\nstreet fracas and in the subsequent radio debate was apparently not\r\nenough to satisfy him. He exaggerated in his letters to V. T. Lee in\r\nan apparent attempt to make himself and his activities appear far more\r\nimportant than they really were.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSWALD DISTRIBUTING FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA HANDBILLS IN NEW\r\nORLEANS, AUGUST 16, 1963--INSETS SHOW SAMPLES OF HIS HANDBILLS ON\r\nWHICH HE HAD STAMPED HIS NAME AND THE NAME OF “A J HIDELL”\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT 2966 A\r\n\r\nCOMMISSION EXHIBIT 2966 B\r\n\r\nGARNER DEPOSITION EXHIBIT 1]\r\n\r\nHis attempt to express himself through his Fair Play for Cuba\r\nactivities, however, was greatly impeded by the fact that the radio\r\ndebate over WDSU on August 21, 1963, brought out the history of his\r\ndefection to the Soviet Union.[C7-345] The basic facts of the event\r\nwere uncovered independently by William Stuckey, who arranged the\r\ndebate, and Edward Butler, executive director of the Information\r\nCouncil of the Americas, who also appeared on the program.[C7-346]\r\nOswald was confronted with those facts at the beginning of the debate\r\nand was so thrown on the defensive by this that he was forced to state\r\nthat Fair Play for Cuba was “not at all Communist controlled regardless\r\nof the fact that I had the experience of living in Russia.”[C7-347]\r\n\r\nStuckey testified that uncovering Oswald’s defection was very important:\r\n\r\n    I think that we finished him on that program. * * * because\r\n    we had publicly linked the Fair Play for Cuba Committee with\r\n    a fellow who had lived in Russia for 3 years and who was an\r\n    admitted Marxist.\r\n\r\n    The interesting thing, or rather the danger involved, was\r\n    the fact that Oswald seemed like such a nice, bright boy and\r\n    was extremely believable before this. We thought the fellow\r\n    could probably get quite a few members if he was really indeed\r\n    serious about getting members. We figured after this broadcast\r\n    of August 21, why, that was no longer possible.[C7-348]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that Oswald had been surprised and was on the\r\ndefensive throughout the debate, according to Stuckey: “Mr. Oswald\r\nhandled himself very well, as usual.”[C7-349] Stuckey thought Oswald\r\n“appeared to be a very logical, intelligent fellow,” and “was arrested\r\nby his cleancutness.”[C7-350] He did not think Oswald looked like the\r\n“type” that he would have expected to find associating with a group\r\nsuch as the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.[C7-351] Stuckey thought that\r\nOswald acted very much as would a young attorney.[C7-352]\r\n\r\nFollowing the disclosure of his defection, Oswald sought advice\r\nfrom the Communist Party, U.S.A., concerning his Fair Play for Cuba\r\nactivity.[C7-353] He had previously sent, apparently unsolicited, to\r\nthe Party newspaper, the Worker, samples of his photographic work,\r\noffering to contribute that sort of service without charge.[C7-354]\r\nThe Worker replied: “Your kind offer is most welcomed and from time to\r\ntime we shall call on you.”[C7-355] He later wrote to another official\r\nof the Worker, seeking employment, and mentioning the praise he had\r\nreceived for submitting his photographic work.[C7-356] He presented\r\nArnold Johnson, Gus Hall, and Benjamin J. Davis honorary membership\r\ncards in his nonexistent New Orleans chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba\r\nCommittee, and advised them of some of his activities on behalf of the\r\norganization.[C7-357] Arnold Johnson, director of the information and\r\nlecture bureau of the Communist Party, U.S.A., replied stating:\r\n\r\n    It is good to know that movements in support of fair play for\r\n    Cuba has developed in New Orleans as well as in other cities.\r\n    We do not have any organizational ties with the Committee, and\r\n    yet there is much material that we issue from time to time that\r\n    is important for anybody who is concerned about developments in\r\n    Cuba.[C7-358]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald said that such correspondence from people he considered\r\nimportant meant much to Oswald. After he had begun his Cuban activity\r\nin New Orleans “he received a letter from somebody in New York, some\r\nCommunist--probably from New York--I am not sure from where--from some\r\nCommunist leader and he was very happy, he felt that this was a great\r\nman that he had received the letter from.”[C7-359] Since he seemed to\r\nfeel that no one else understood his political views, the letter was of\r\ngreat value to him for it “was proof * * * that there were people who\r\nunderstood his activity.”[C7-360]\r\n\r\nHe anticipated that the full disclosure of his defection would\r\nhinder him in “the struggle for progress and freedom in the United\r\nStates”[C7-361] into which Oswald, in his own words, had “thrown”\r\nhimself. He sought advice from the central committee of the Communist\r\nParty, U.S.A., in a letter dated August 28, 1963, about whether he\r\ncould “continue to fight, handicapped as it were, by my past record\r\n* * * [and] compete with anti-progressive forces, above-ground or\r\nweather in your opion I should always remain in the background, i.e.\r\nunderground.”[C7-362] Stating that he had used his “position” with what\r\nhe claimed to be the local branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee\r\nto “foster communist ideals,” Oswald wrote that he felt that he might\r\nhave compromised the FPCC and expressed concern lest “Our opponents\r\ncould use my background of residence in the U.S.S.R. against any cause\r\nwhich I join, by association, they could say the organization of which\r\nI am a member, is Russian controled, ect.”[C7-363] In reply Arnold\r\nJohnson advised Oswald that, while as an American citizen he had a\r\nright to participate in such organizations as he wished, “there are a\r\nnumber of organizations, including possibly Fair Play, which are of\r\na very broad character, and often it is advisable for some people to\r\nremain in the background, not underground.”[C7-364]\r\n\r\nBy August of 1963, after a short 3 months in New Orleans, the city in\r\nwhich he had been born and had lived most of his early life, Oswald\r\nhad fallen on difficult times. He had not liked his job as a greaser\r\nof coffee processing machinery and he held it for only a little over 2\r\nmonths.[C7-365] He had not found another job. His wife was expecting\r\ntheir second child in October and there was concern about the cost\r\nwhich would be involved.[C7-366] His brief foray on behalf of the Fair\r\nPlay for Cuba Committee had failed to win any support. While he had\r\ndrawn some attention to himself and had actually appeared on two radio\r\nprograms, he had been attacked by Cuban exiles and arrested, an event\r\nwhich his wife thought upset him and as a result of which “he became\r\nless active, he cooled off a little.”[C7-367] More seriously, the\r\nfacts of his defection had become known, leaving him open to almost\r\nunanswerable attack by those who opposed his views. It would not have\r\nbeen possible to have followed Arnold Johnson’s advice to remain in\r\nthe background, since there was no background to the New Orleans FPCC\r\n“organization,” which consisted solely of Oswald. Furthermore, he had\r\napparently not received any letters from the national headquarters\r\nof FPCC since May 29, 1963,[C7-368] even though he had written four\r\ndetailed letters since that time to Mr. V. T. Lee[C7-369] and had also\r\nkept the national headquarters informed of each of his changes of\r\nmailing address.[C7-370] Those events no doubt had their effects on\r\nOswald.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterest in Cuba\r\n\r\nBy August of 1963, Oswald had for some time been considering the\r\npossibility of leaving the United States again. On June 24, 1963, he\r\napplied for a new passport[C7-371] and in late June or early July\r\nhe told his wife that he wanted to return to the Soviet Union with\r\nher. She said that he was extremely upset, very unhappy, and that he\r\nactually wept when he told her that.[C7-372] He said that nothing\r\nkept him in the United States, that he would not lose anything if he\r\nreturned to the Soviet Union, that he wanted to be with her and that\r\nit would be better to have less and not have to be concerned about\r\ntomorrow.[C7-373]\r\n\r\nAs a result of that conversation, Marina Oswald wrote the Soviet\r\nEmbassy in Washington concerning a request she had first made on\r\nFebruary 17, 1963, for permission for herself and June to return to\r\nthe Soviet Union.[C7-374] While that first request, made according to\r\nMarina Oswald at her husband’s insistence, specifically stated that\r\nOswald was to remain in the United States, she wrote in her letter\r\nof July 1963, that “things are improving due to the fact that my\r\nhusband expresses a sincere wish to return together with me to the\r\nUSSR.”[C7-375] Unknown to his wife, however, Oswald apparently enclosed\r\na note with her letter of July in which he requested the Embassy to\r\nrush his wife’s entrance visa because of the impending birth of the\r\nsecond child but stated that: “As for my return entrance visa please\r\nconsider it _separtably_.”[C7-376]\r\n\r\nThus, while Oswald’s real intentions, assuming that they were known to\r\nhimself, are not clear, he may not have intended to go to the Soviet\r\nUnion directly, if at all.[C7-377] It appears that he really wanted to\r\ngo to Cuba. In his wife’s words:\r\n\r\n    I only know that his basic desire was to get to Cuba by any\r\n    means, and that all the rest of it was window dressing for that\r\n    purpose.[C7-378]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald testified that her husband engaged in Fair Play for Cuba\r\nCommittee activities “primarily for purposes of self-advertising. He\r\nwanted to be arrested. I think he wanted to get into the newspapers, so\r\nthat he would be known.”[C7-379] According to Marina Oswald, he thought\r\nthat would help him when he got to Cuba.[C7-380] He asked his wife to\r\nhelp him to hijack an airplane to get there, but gave up that scheme\r\nwhen she refused.[C7-381]\r\n\r\nDuring this period Oswald may have practiced opening and closing the\r\nbolt on his rifle in a screened porch in his apartment.[C7-382] In\r\nSeptember he began to review Spanish.[C7-383] He approved arrangements\r\nfor his family to return to Irving, Tex., to live with Mrs. Ruth\r\nPaine.[C7-384] On September 20, 1963, Mrs. Paine and her two children\r\narrived in New Orleans from a trip to the East Coast[C7-385] and left\r\nfor Irving with Marina Oswald and June and most of the Oswalds’ effects\r\n3 days later.[C7-386] While Marina Oswald knew of her husband’s plan\r\nto go to Mexico and thence to Cuba if possible,[C7-387] Mrs. Paine was\r\ntold that Oswald was going to Houston and possibly to Philadelphia to\r\nlook for work.[C7-388]\r\n\r\nOswald left for Mexico City on September 25, 1963, and arrived on\r\nSeptember 27, 1963. He went almost directly to the Cuban Embassy and\r\napplied for a visa to Cuba in transit to Russia.[C7-389] Representing\r\nhimself as the head of the New Orleans branch of the “organization\r\ncalled ‘Fair Play for Cuba,’ he stated his desire that he should be\r\naccepted as a ‘friend’ of the Cuban Revolution.”[C7-390] He apparently\r\nbased his claim for a visa in transit to Russia on his previous\r\nresidence, his work permit for that country, and several unidentified\r\nletters in the Russian language. The Cubans would not, however, give\r\nhim a visa until he had received one from the Soviets, which involved a\r\ndelay of several months. When faced with that situation Oswald became\r\ngreatly agitated, and although he later unsuccessfully attempted to\r\nobtain a Soviet visa at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, he insisted\r\nthat he was entitled to the Cuban visa because of his background,\r\npartisanship, and personal activities on behalf of the Cuban movement.\r\nHe engaged in an angry argument with the consul who finally told him\r\nthat “as far as he was concerned he would not give him a visa” and that\r\n“a person like him [Oswald] in place of aiding the Cuban Revolution,\r\nwas doing it harm.”[C7-391]\r\n\r\nOswald must have been thoroughly disillusioned when he left Mexico City\r\non October 2, 1963. In spite of his former residence in the Soviet\r\nUnion and his Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities he had been\r\nrebuffed by the officials of both Cuba and the Soviet Union in Mexico\r\nCity. Now there appeared to be no chance to get to Cuba, where he had\r\nthought he might find his communist ideal. The U.S. Government would\r\nnot permit travel there and as far as the performance of the Cubans\r\nthemselves was concerned, he was “disappointed at not being able to\r\nget to Cuba, and he didn’t have any great desire to do so any more\r\nbecause he had run into, as he himself said--into bureaucracy and red\r\ntape.”[C7-392]\r\n\r\nOswald’s attempt to go to Cuba was another act which expressed his\r\nhostility toward the United States and its institutions as well as a\r\nconcomitant attachment to a country in which he must have thought were\r\nembodied the political principles to which he had been committed for\r\nso long. It should be noted that his interest in Cuba seems to have\r\nincreased along with the sense of frustration which must have developed\r\nas he experienced successive failures in his jobs, in his political\r\nactivity, and in his personal relationships. In retrospect his attempt\r\nto go to Cuba or return to the Soviet Union may well have been Oswald’s\r\nlast escape hatch, his last gambit to extricate himself from the\r\nmediocrity and defeat which plagued him throughout most of his life.\r\n\r\nOswald’s activities with regard to Cuba raise serious questions as\r\nto how much he might have been motivated in the assassination by a\r\ndesire to aid the Castro regime, which President Kennedy so outspokenly\r\ncriticized. For example, the Dallas Times Herald of November 19, 1963,\r\nprominently reported President Kennedy as having “all but invited\r\nthe Cuban people today to overthrow Fidel Castro’s Communist regime\r\nand promised prompt U.S. aid if they do.”[C7-393] The Castro regime\r\nseverely attacked President Kennedy in connection with the Bay of\r\nPigs affair, the Cuban missile crisis, the ban on travel to Cuba, the\r\neconomic embargo against that country, and the general policy of the\r\nUnited States with regard to Cuba. An examination of the Militant, to\r\nwhich Oswald subscribed,[C7-394] for the 3-month period prior to the\r\nassassination reflects an extremely critical attitude toward President\r\nKennedy and his administration concerning Cuban policy in general as\r\nwell as on the issues of automation and civil rights, issues which\r\nappeared to concern Oswald a great deal.[C7-395] The Militant also\r\nreflected a critical attitude toward President Kennedy’s attempts to\r\nreduce tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. It\r\nalso dealt with the fear of the Castro regime that such a policy might\r\nresult in its abandonment by the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nThe October 7, 1963, issue of the Militant reported Castro as saying\r\nCuba could not accept a situation where at the same time the United\r\nStates was trying to ease world tensions it also “was increasing\r\nits efforts to ‘tighten the noose’ around Cuba.”[C7-396] Castro’s\r\nopposition to President Kennedy’s attempt to reduce world tensions was\r\nalso reported in the October 1, 1963, issue of the Worker, to which\r\nOswald also subscribed.[C7-397] In this connection it should be noted\r\nthat in speaking of the Worker, Oswald told Michael Paine, apparently\r\nin all seriousness, that “you could tell what they wanted you to do *\r\n* * by reading between the lines, reading the thing and doing a little\r\nreading between the lines.”[C7-398]\r\n\r\nThe general conflict of views between the United States and Cuba was,\r\nof course, reflected in other media to such an extent that there can\r\nbe no doubt that Oswald was aware generally of the critical attitude\r\nthat Castro expressed about President Kennedy. Oswald was asked during\r\nthe New Orleans radio debate in which he engaged on August 21, 1963,\r\nwhether or not he agreed with Castro that President Kennedy was a\r\n“ruffian and a thief.” He replied that he “would not agree with that\r\nparticular wording.”[C7-399] It should also be noted, however, that\r\none witness testified that shortly before the assassination Oswald had\r\nexpressed approval of President Kennedy’s active role in the area of\r\ncivil rights.[C7-400]\r\n\r\nAlthough Oswald could possibly have been motivated in part by his\r\nsympathy for the Castro government, it should be remembered that his\r\nwife testified that he was disappointed with his failure to get to Cuba\r\nand had lost his desire to do so because of the bureaucracy and red\r\ntape which he had encountered.[C7-401] His unhappy experience with the\r\nCuban consul seems thus to have reduced his enthusiasm for the Castro\r\nregime and his desire to go to Cuba.\r\n\r\nWhile some of Castro’s more severe criticisms of President Kennedy\r\nmight have led Oswald to believe that he would be well received in Cuba\r\nafter he had assassinated the American President, it does not appear\r\nthat he had any plans to go there. Oswald was carrying only $13.87 at\r\nthe time of his arrest, although he had left, apparently by design,\r\n$170 in a wallet in his wife’s room in Irving.[C7-402] If there was no\r\nconspiracy which would help him escape, the possibility of which has\r\nbeen considered in chapter VI, it is unlikely that a reasoning person\r\nwould plan to attempt to travel from Dallas, Tex., to Cuba with $13.87\r\nwhen considerably greater resources were available to him. The fact\r\nthat Oswald left behind the funds which might have enabled him to reach\r\nCuba suggests the absence of any plan to try to flee there and raises\r\nserious questions as to whether or not he ever expected to escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nPossible Influence of Anti-Kennedy Sentiment in Dallas\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that one of the motivating influences operating\r\non Lee Oswald was the atmosphere in the city of Dallas, especially an\r\natmosphere of extreme opposition to President Kennedy that was present\r\nin some parts of the Dallas community and which received publicity\r\nthere prior to the assassination.[C7-403] Some of that feeling was\r\nexpressed in the incident involving then vice-presidential candidate\r\nJohnson during the 1960 campaign, in the treatment of Ambassador Adlai\r\nStevenson late in October of 1963 and in the extreme anti-Kennedy\r\nnewspaper advertisement and handbills that appeared in Dallas at the\r\ntime of the President’s visit there.[C7-404]\r\n\r\nThe Commission has found no evidence that the extreme views expressed\r\ntoward President Kennedy by some rightwing groups centered in Dallas\r\nor any other general atmosphere of hate or rightwing extremism which\r\nmay have existed in the city of Dallas had any connection with Oswald’s\r\nactions on November 22, 1963. There is, of course, no way to judge\r\nwhat the effect of the general political ferment present in that city\r\nmight have been, even though Oswald was aware of it. His awareness is\r\nshown by a letter that he wrote to Arnold Johnson of the Communist\r\nParty U.S.A., which Johnson said he did not receive until after the\r\nassassination. The letter said in part:\r\n\r\n    On October 23rd, I had attened a ultra-right meeting headed by\r\n    General Edwin A. Walker, who lives in Dallas.\r\n\r\n    This meeting preceded by one day the attack on A. E. Stevenson\r\n    at the United Nations Day meeting at which he spoke\r\n\r\n    As you can see, political friction between “left” and “right”\r\n    is very great here.\r\n\r\n    Could you advise me as to the general view we have on the\r\n    American Civil Liberties Union?[C7-405]\r\n\r\nIn any event, the Commission has been unable to find any credible\r\nevidence that Oswald had direct contact or association with any of\r\nthe personalities or groups epitomizing or representing the so-called\r\nrightwing, even though he did, as he told Johnson, attend a meeting\r\nat which General Walker spoke to approximately 1,300 persons.[C7-406]\r\nOswald’s writings and his reading habits indicate that he had an\r\nextreme dislike of the rightwing, an attitude most clearly reflected by\r\nhis attempt to shoot General Walker.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship With Wife\r\n\r\nThe relations between Lee and Marina Oswald are of great importance\r\nin any attempt to understand Oswald’s possible motivation. During the\r\nperiod from Oswald’s return from Mexico to the assassination, he and\r\nhis wife spent every weekend but one together at the Irving, Tex.,\r\nhome of Mrs. Ruth Paine, who was then separated from her husband. The\r\nsole exception was the weekend of November 16-17, 1963, the weekend\r\nbefore the assassination, when his wife asked Oswald not to come to\r\nIrving. During the week, Oswald lived in a roominghouse in Dallas, but\r\nhe usually called his wife on the telephone twice a day.[C7-407] She\r\ntestified that after his return from Mexico Oswald “changed for the\r\nbetter. He began to treat me better. * * * He helped me more--although\r\nhe always did help. But he was more attentive.”[C7-408] Marina Oswald\r\nattributed that to their living apart and to the imminent birth of\r\ntheir second child. She testified that Oswald “was very happy” about\r\nthe birth of the child.[C7-409]\r\n\r\nWhile those considerations no doubt had an effect on Oswald’s attitude\r\ntoward his family it would seem that the need for support and sympathy\r\nafter his recent rebuffs in Mexico City might also have been important\r\nto him. It would not have been the first time that Oswald sought closer\r\nties with his family in time of adversity.[C7-410]\r\n\r\nHis past relationships with his wife had been stormy, however, and it\r\ndid not seem that she respected him very much. They had been married\r\nafter a courtship of only about 6 weeks, a part of which Oswald\r\nspent in the hospital. Oswald’s diary reports that he married his\r\nwife shortly after his proposal of marriage to another girl had been\r\nrejected. He stated that the other girl rejected him partly because\r\nhe was an American, a fact that he said she had exploited. He stated\r\nthat “In spite of fact I married Marina to hurt Ella [the girl that had\r\nrejected him] I found myself in love with Marina.”[C7-411] Many of the\r\npeople with whom the Oswalds became acquainted after their arrival in\r\nthe United States thought that Marina Oswald had married her husband\r\nprimarily in the hope that she would be able to leave the Soviet Union.\r\nMarina Oswald has denied this.[C7-412]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald expressed one aspect of her husband’s attitude toward her\r\nwhen she testified that:\r\n\r\n    * * * Lee wanted me to go to Russia, and I told him that if he\r\n    wanted me to go then that meant that he didn’t love me, and\r\n    that in that case what was the idea of coming to the United\r\n    States in the first place. Lee would say that it would be\r\n    better for me if I went to Russia. I did not know why. I did\r\n    not know what he had in mind. He said he loved me but that it\r\n    would be better for me if I went to Russia, and what he had in\r\n    mind I don’t know.[C7-413]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Oswald objected to the invitation that his wife\r\nhad received to live with Mrs. Ruth Paine, which Mrs. Paine had\r\nmade in part to give her an alternative to returning to the Soviet\r\nUnion.[C7-414] Marina Oswald wrote to Mrs. Paine that: “Many times he\r\n[Oswald] has recalled this matter to me and said that I am just waiting\r\nfor an opportunity to hurt him. It has been the cause of many of our\r\narguments.”[C7-415] Oswald claimed that his wife preferred others to\r\nhim.[C7-416] He said this about members of the Russian-speaking group\r\nin the Dallas-Ft. Worth area, whom she said he tried to forbid her from\r\nseeing,[C7-417] and also about Mrs. Paine.[C7-418] He specifically made\r\nthat claim when his wife refused to come to live with him in Dallas as\r\nhe asked her to do on the evening of November 21, 1963.[C7-419]\r\n\r\nThe instability of their relations was probably a function of the\r\npersonalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations with\r\nhis wife. He apparently attempted to be “the Commander” by dictating\r\nmany of the details of their married life.[C7-420] While Marina Oswald\r\nsaid that her husband wanted her to learn English,[C7-421] he made no\r\nattempt to help her and there are other indications that he did not\r\nwant her to learn that language. Oswald apparently wished to continue\r\npracticing his own Russian with her.[C7-422] Lieutenant Martello of\r\nthe New Orleans police testified that Oswald stated that he did not\r\nspeak English in his family because he did not want them to become\r\nAmericanized.[C7-423] Marina Oswald’s inability to speak English also\r\nmade it more difficult for her to have an independent existence in this\r\ncountry. Oswald struck his wife on occasion,[C7-424] did not want her\r\nto drink, smoke or wear cosmetics[C7-425] and generally treated her\r\nwith lack of respect in the presence of others.[C7-426]\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which Oswald’s problems would have caused him in any\r\nrelationship were probably not reduced by his wife’s conduct. Katherine\r\nFord, with whom Marina Oswald stayed during her separation from her\r\nhusband in November of 1962, thought that Marina Oswald was immature\r\nin her thinking and partly responsible for the difficulties that the\r\nOswalds were having at that time.[C7-427] Mrs. Ford said that Marina\r\nOswald admitted that she provoked Oswald on occasion.[C7-428] There\r\ncan be little doubt that some provocation existed. Oswald once struck\r\nhis wife because of a letter which she wrote to a former boy friend in\r\nRussia. In the letter Marina Oswald stated that her husband had changed\r\na great deal and that she was very lonely in the United States. She was\r\n“sorry that I had not married him [the Russian boy friend] instead,\r\nthat it would have been much easier for me.”[C7-429] The letter fell\r\ninto Oswald’s hands when it was returned to his post office box because\r\nof insufficient postage, which apparently resulted from an increase in\r\npostal rates of which his wife had been unaware.[C7-430] Oswald read\r\nthe letter, but refused to believe that it was sincere, even though\r\nhis wife insisted to him that it was. As a result Oswald struck her,\r\nas to which she testified: “Generally, I think that was right, for\r\nsuch things that is the right thing to do. There was some grounds for\r\nit.”[C7-431]\r\n\r\nAlthough she denied it in some of her testimony before the\r\nCommission,[C7-432] it appears that Marina Oswald also complained\r\nthat her husband was not able to provide more material things for\r\nher.[C7-433] On that issue George De Mohrenschildt, who was probably as\r\nclose to the Oswalds as anyone else during their first stay in Dallas,\r\nsaid that:\r\n\r\n    She was annoying him all the time--“Why don’t you make some\r\n    money?” * * * Poor guy was going out of his mind. * * *\r\n\r\n    We told her she should not annoy him--poor guy, he is doing his\r\n    best, “Don’t annoy him so much.” * * *[C7-434]\r\n\r\nThe De Mohrenschildts also testified that “right in front” of\r\nOswald Marina Oswald complained about Oswald’s inadequacy as a\r\nhusband.[C7-435] Mrs. Oswald told another of her friends that Oswald\r\nwas very cold to her, that they very seldom had sexual relations and\r\nthat Oswald “was not a man.”[C7-436] She also told Mrs. Paine that she\r\nwas not satisfied with her sexual relations with Oswald.[C7-437]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald also ridiculed her husband’s political views, thereby\r\ntearing down his view of his own importance. He was very much\r\ninterested in autobiographical works of outstanding statesmen of the\r\nUnited States, to whom his wife thought he compared himself.[C7-438]\r\nShe said he was different from other people in “At least his\r\nimagination, his fantasy, which was quite unfounded, as to the fact\r\nthat he was an outstanding man.”[C7-439] She said that she “always\r\ntried to point out to him that he was a man like any others who were\r\naround us. But he simply could not understand that.”[C7-440] Jeanne De\r\nMohrenschildt, however, thought that Marina Oswald “said things that\r\nwill hurt men’s pride.”[C7-441] She said that if she ever spoke to her\r\nhusband the way Marina Oswald spoke to her husband, “we would not last\r\nlong.”[C7-442] Mrs. De Mohrenschildt thought that Oswald, whom she\r\ncompared to “a puppy dog that everybody kicked,”[C7-443] had a lot of\r\ngood qualities, in spite of the fact that “Nobody said anything good\r\nabout him.”[C7-444] She had “the impression that he was just pushed,\r\npushed, pushed, and she [Marina Oswald] was probably nagging, nagging,\r\nnagging.”[C7-445] She thought that he might not have become involved in\r\nthe assassination if people had been kinder to him.[C7-446]\r\n\r\nIn spite of these difficulties, however, and in the face of the\r\neconomic problems that were always with them, things apparently went\r\nquite smoothly from the time Oswald returned from Mexico until the\r\nweekend of November 16-17, 1963.[C7-447] Mrs. Paine was planning a\r\nbirthday party for one of her children on that weekend and her husband,\r\nMichael, was to be at the house. Marina Oswald said that she knew her\r\nhusband did not like Michael Paine and so she asked him not to come\r\nout that weekend, even though he wanted to do so. She testified that\r\nshe told him “that he shouldn’t come every week, that perhaps it is\r\nnot convenient for Ruth that the whole family be there, live there.”\r\nShe testified that he responded: “As you wish. If you don’t want me\r\nto come, I won’t.”[C7-448] Ruth Paine testified that she heard Marina\r\nOswald tell Oswald about the birthday party.[C7-449]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, November 17, 1963, Ruth Paine and Marina Oswald decided to\r\ncall Oswald[C7-450] at the place where he was living, unbeknownst to\r\nthem, under the name of O. H. Lee.[C7-451] They asked for Lee Oswald\r\nwho was not called to the telephone because he was known by the other\r\nname.[C7-452] When Oswald called the next day his wife became very\r\nangry about his use of the alias.[C7-453] He said that he used it\r\nbecause “he did not want his landlady to know his real name because\r\nshe might read in the paper of the fact that he had been in Russia and\r\nthat he had been questioned.”[C7-454] Oswald also said that he did not\r\nwant the FBI to know where he lived “Because their visits were not\r\nvery pleasant for him and he thought that he loses jobs because the\r\nFBI visits the place of his employment.”[C7-455] While the facts of\r\nhis defection had become known in New Orleans as a result of his radio\r\ndebate with Bringuier,[C7-456] it would appear to be unlikely that\r\nhis landlady in Dallas would see anything in the newspaper about his\r\ndefection, unless he engaged in activities similar to those which had\r\nled to the disclosure of his defection in New Orleans. Furthermore,\r\neven though it appears that at times Oswald was really upset by visits\r\nof the FBI, it does not appear that he ever lost his job because of\r\nits activities, although he may well not have been aware of that\r\nfact.[C7-457]\r\n\r\nWhile Oswald’s concern about the FBI had some basis in fact, in\r\nthat FBI agents had interviewed him in the past and had renewed\r\ntheir interest to some extent after his Fair Play for Cuba Committee\r\nactivities had become known, he exaggerated their concern for\r\nhim. Marina Oswald thought he did so in order to emphasize his\r\nimportance.[C7-458] For example, in his letter of November 9, 1963, to\r\nthe Soviet Embassy in Washington, he asked about the entrance visas for\r\nwhich he and his wife had previously applied. He absolved the Soviet\r\nEmbassy in Mexico City of any blame for his difficulties there. He\r\nadvised the Washington Embassy that the FBI was “not now” interested\r\nin his Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities, but noted that the FBI\r\n“has visited us here in Dallas, Texas, on November 1. Agent James P.\r\nHasty warned me that if I engaged in F.P.C.C. activities in Texas the\r\nF.B.I. will again take an ‘interrest’ in me.”[C7-459] Neither Hosty\r\nnor any other agent of the FBI spoke to Oswald on any subject from\r\nAugust 10, 1963, to the time of the assassination.[C7-460] The claimed\r\nwarning was one more of Oswald’s fabrications. Hosty had come to the\r\nPaine residence on November 1 and 5, 1963, but did not issue any such\r\nwarning or suggest that Marina Oswald defect from the Soviet Union\r\nand remain in the United States under FBI protection, as Oswald went\r\non to say.[C7-461] In Oswald’s imagination “I and my wife strongly\r\nprotested these tactics by the notorious F.B.I.”[C7-462] In fact, his\r\nwife testified that she only said that she would prefer not to receive\r\nany more visits from the Bureau because of the “very exciting and\r\ndisturbing effect” they had upon her husband,[C7-463] who was not even\r\npresent at that time.[C7-464]\r\n\r\nThe arguments he used to justify his use of the alias suggest that\r\nOswald may have come to think that the whole world was becoming\r\ninvolved in an increasingly complex conspiracy against him. He may\r\nhave felt he could never tell when the FBI was going to appear on the\r\nscene or who else was going to find out about his defection and use it\r\nagainst him as had been done in New Orleans.[C7-465] On the other hand,\r\nthe concern he expressed about the FBI may have been just another story\r\nto support the objective he sought in his letter.\r\n\r\nThose arguments, however, were not persuasive to Marina Oswald, to whom\r\n“it was nothing terrible if people were to find out that he had been\r\nin Russia.”[C7-466] She asked Oswald: “After all, when will all your\r\nfoolishness come to an end? All of these comedies. First one thing and\r\nthen another. And now this fictitious name.”[C7-467] She said: “On\r\nMonday [November 18, 1963] he called several times, but after I hung up\r\non him and didn’t want to talk to him he did not call again. He then\r\narrived on Thursday [November 21, 1963].”[C7-468]\r\n\r\nThe events of that evening can best be appreciated through Marina\r\nOswald’s testimony:\r\n\r\n    Q. Did your husband give any reason for coming home on Thursday?\r\n\r\n    A. He said that he was lonely because he hadn’t come the\r\n    preceding weekend, and he wanted to make his peace with me.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you say anything to him then?\r\n\r\n    A. He tried to talk to me but I would not answer him, and he\r\n    was very upset.\r\n\r\n    Q. Were you upset with him?\r\n\r\n    A. I was angry, of course. He was not angry--he was upset. I\r\n    was angry. He tried very hard to please me. He spent quite a\r\n    bit of time putting away diapers and played with the children\r\n    on the street.\r\n\r\n    Q. How did you indicate to him that you were angry with him?\r\n\r\n    A. By not talking to him.\r\n\r\n    Q. And how did he show that he was upset?\r\n\r\n    A. He was upset over the fact that I would not answer him.\r\n    He tried to start a conversation with me several times, but\r\n    I would not answer. And he said that he didn’t want me to be\r\n    angry at him because this upsets him.\r\n\r\n    On that day, he suggested that we rent an apartment in Dallas.\r\n    He said that he was tired of living alone and perhaps the\r\n    reason for my being so angry was the fact that we were not\r\n    living together. That if I want to he would rent an apartment\r\n    in Dallas tomorrow--that he didn’t want me to remain with Ruth\r\n    any longer, but wanted me to live with him in Dallas.\r\n\r\n    He repeated this not once but several times, but I refused. And\r\n    he said that once again I was preferring my friends to him, and\r\n    that I didn’t need him.\r\n\r\n    Q. What did you say to that?\r\n\r\n    A. I said it would be better if I remained with Ruth until\r\n    the holidays, he would come, and we would all meet together.\r\n    That this was better because while he was living alone and I\r\n    stayed with Ruth, we were spending less money. And I told him\r\n    to buy me a washing machine, because two children it became too\r\n    difficult to wash by hand.\r\n\r\n    Q. What did he say to that?\r\n\r\n    A. He said he would buy me a washing machine.\r\n\r\n    Q. What did you say to that?\r\n\r\n    A. Thank you. That it would be better if he bought something\r\n    for himself--that I would manage.[C7-469]\r\n\r\nThat night Oswald went to bed before his wife retired. She did not\r\nspeak to him when she joined him there, although she thought that he\r\nwas still awake. The next morning he left for work before anyone else\r\narose.[C7-470] For the first time he left his wedding ring in a cup on\r\nthe dresser in his room.[C7-471] He also left $170 in a wallet in one\r\nof the dresser drawers. He took with him $13.87[C7-472] and the long\r\nbrown package that Frazier and Mrs. Randle saw him carry and which he\r\nwas to take to the School Book Depository.[C7-473]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unanswered Questions\r\n\r\nNo one will ever know what passed through Oswald’s mind during the week\r\nbefore November 22, 1963. Instead of returning to Irving on November 15\r\nfor his customary weekend visit, he remained in Dallas at his wife’s\r\nsuggestion because of the birthday party. He had argued with her\r\nover the use of an alias and had not called her after that argument,\r\nalthough he usually telephoned once or twice a day. Then on Thursday\r\nmorning, November 21, he asked Frazier for a ride to Irving that\r\nnight, stating falsely that he wanted to pick up some curtain rods to\r\nput in an apartment.[C7-474]\r\n\r\nHe must have planned his attack at the very latest prior to Thursday\r\nmorning when he spoke to Frazier. There is, of course, no way to\r\ndetermine the degree to which he was committed to his plan at that\r\ntime. While there is no way to tell when he first began to think\r\nspecifically of assassinating the President it should be noted that\r\nmention of the Trade Mart as the expected site of the Presidential\r\nluncheon appeared in The Dallas Times Herald on November 15,\r\n1963.[C7-475] The next day that paper announced the final approval\r\nof the Trade Mart as the luncheon site and stated that the motorcade\r\n“apparently will loop through the downtown area, probably on Main\r\nStreet, en route from Dallas Love Field” on its way to the Trade Mart\r\non Stemmons Freeway.[C7-476] Anyone who was familiar with that area\r\nof Dallas would have known that the motorcade would probably pass the\r\nTexas School Book Depository to get from Main Street onto the Stemmons\r\nFreeway. That fact was made precisely clear in subsequent news stories\r\non November 19, 20, and 22.[C7-477]\r\n\r\nOn November 15, 1963, the same day that his wife told him not to come\r\nto Irving, Oswald could have assumed that the Presidential motorcade\r\nwould pass in front of his place of work. Whether he thought about\r\nassassinating the President over the weekend can never be known, but\r\nit is reasonably certain that over the weekend he did think about\r\nhis wife’s request that he not come to Irving, which was prompted\r\nby the birthday party being held at the Paine home. Oswald had a\r\nhighly exaggerated sense of his own importance, but he had failed at\r\nalmost everything he had ever tried to do. He had great difficulty in\r\nestablishing meaningful relations with other people. Except for his\r\nfamily he was completely alone. Even though he had searched--in the\r\nMarine Corps, in his ideal of communism, in the Soviet Union and in his\r\nattempt to get to Cuba--he had never found anything to which he felt he\r\ncould really belong.\r\n\r\nAfter he returned from his trip to Mexico where his application to go\r\nto Cuba had been sharply rejected, it must have appeared to him that\r\nhe was unable to command even the attention of his family. He could\r\nnot keep them with him in Dallas, where at least he could see his\r\nchildren whom, several witnesses testified, he seemed to love.[C7-478]\r\nHis family lived with Mrs. Paine, ostensibly because Oswald could not\r\nafford to keep an apartment in Dallas, but it was also, at least in\r\npart, because his wife did not want to live there with him.[C7-479] Now\r\nit appeared that he was not welcome at the Paine home, where he had\r\nspent every previous weekend since his return from Mexico and his wife\r\nwas once again calling into question his judgment, this time concerning\r\nhis use of an alias.\r\n\r\nThe conversation on Monday, November 18, 1963, ended when Marina Oswald\r\nhung up and refused to talk to him. Although he may long before have\r\ndecided on the course he was to follow and may have told his wife the\r\nthings he did on the evening of November 21, 1963, merely to disarm\r\nher and to provide a justification of sorts, both she and Mrs. Paine\r\nthought he had come home to make up after the fight on Monday.[C7-480]\r\nThoughts of his personal difficulties must have been at least partly\r\non his mind when he went to Irving on Thursday night and told his wife\r\nthat he was lonely, that he wanted to make peace with her and bring his\r\nfamily to Dallas where they could live with him again.\r\n\r\nThe Commission does not believe that the relations between Oswald\r\nand his wife caused him to assassinate the President. It is unlikely\r\nthat the motivation was that simple. The feelings of hostility and\r\naggression which seem to have played such an important part in Oswald’s\r\nlife were part of his character long before he met his wife and such a\r\nfavorable opportunity to strike at a figure as great as the President\r\nwould probably never have come to him again.\r\n\r\nOswald’s behavior after the assassination throws little light on his\r\nmotives. The fact that he took so little money with him when he left\r\nIrving in the morning indicates that he did not expect to get very far\r\nfrom Dallas on his own and suggests the possibility, as did his note\r\nto his wife just prior to the attempt on General Walker, that he did\r\nnot expect to escape at all. On the other hand, he could have traveled\r\nsome distance with the money he did have and he did return to his room\r\nwhere he obtained his revolver. He then killed Patrolman Tippit when\r\nthat police officer apparently tried to question him after he had left\r\nhis roominghouse and he vigorously resisted arrest when he was finally\r\napprehended in the Texas Theatre. Although it is not fully corroborated\r\nby others who were present, two officers have testified that at the\r\ntime of his arrest Oswald said something to the effect that “it’s all\r\nover now.”[C7-481]\r\n\r\nOswald was overbearing and arrogant throughout much of the time between\r\nhis arrest and his own death.[C7-482] He consistently refused to\r\nadmit involvement in the assassination or in the killing of Patrolman\r\nTippit.[C7-483] While he did become enraged at at least one point in\r\nhis interrogation, the testimony of the officers present indicates that\r\nhe handled himself with considerable composure during his questioning.\r\nHe admitted nothing that would damage him but discussed other matters\r\nquite freely.[C7-484] His denials under questioning, which have no\r\nprobative value in view of the many readily demonstrable lies he told\r\nat that time[C7-485] and in the face of the overwhelming evidence\r\nagainst him which has been set forth above, only served to prolong the\r\nperiod during which he was the center of the attention of the entire\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nMany factors were undoubtedly involved in Oswald’s motivation for the\r\nassassination, and the Commission does not believe that it can ascribe\r\nto him any one motive or group of motives. It is apparent, however,\r\nthat Oswald was moved by an overriding hostility to his environment.\r\nHe does not appear to have been able to establish meaningful\r\nrelationships with other people. He was perpetually discontented with\r\nthe world around him. Long before the assassination he expressed his\r\nhatred for American society and acted in protest against it. Oswald’s\r\nsearch for what he conceived to be the perfect society was doomed from\r\nthe start. He sought for himself a place in history--a role as the\r\n“great man” who would be recognized as having been in advance of his\r\ntimes. His commitment to Marxism and communism appears to have been\r\nanother important factor in his motivation. He also had demonstrated a\r\ncapacity to act decisively and without regard to the consequences when\r\nsuch action would further his aims of the moment. Out of these and the\r\nmany other factors which may have molded the character of Lee Harvey\r\nOswald there emerged a man capable of assassinating President Kennedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nThe Protection of the President\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 100 years since 1865 four Presidents of the United States\r\nhave been assassinated--Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William\r\nMcKinley, and John F. Kennedy. During this same period there were\r\nthree other attacks on the life of a President, a President-elect, and\r\na candidate for the Presidency, which narrowly failed: on Theodore\r\nRoosevelt while campaigning in October of 1912; on President-elect\r\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, when visiting Miami on February 15,\r\n1933; and on President Harry S. Truman on November 1, 1950, when\r\nhis temporary residence, Blair House, was attacked by Puerto Rican\r\nNationalists.[C8-1] One out of every five Presidents since 1865 has\r\nbeen assassinated; there have been attempts on the lives of one out of\r\nevery three.\r\n\r\nPrompted by these dismaying statistics, the Commission has inquired\r\ninto the problems and methods of Presidential protection in effect at\r\nthe time of President Kennedy’s assassination. This study has led the\r\nCommission to conclude that the public interest might be served by any\r\ncontribution it can make to the improvement of protective arrangements.\r\nThe Commission has not undertaken a comprehensive examination of all\r\nfacets of this subject; rather, it has devoted its time and resources\r\nto those broader aspects of Presidential protection to which the events\r\nof last November called attention.\r\n\r\nIn this part of its inquiry the Commission has had full access to\r\na major study of all phases of protective activities prepared by\r\nthe Secret Service for the Secretary of the Treasury following the\r\nassassination. As a result of this study, the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury has prepared a planning document dated August 27, 1964,\r\nwhich recommends additional personnel and facilities to enable the\r\nSecret Service to expand its protection capabilities. The Secretary\r\nof the Treasury submitted this planning document on August 31, 1964,\r\nto the Bureau of the Budget for review and approval. This planning\r\ndocument has been made a part of the Commission’s published record; the\r\nunderlying staff and consultants’ reports reviewed by the Commission\r\nhave not, since a disclosure of such detailed information relating to\r\nprotective measures might undermine present methods of protecting the\r\nPresident. However, all information considered by the Commission which\r\npertains to the protective function as it was carried out in Dallas has\r\nbeen published as part of this report.\r\n\r\nThe protection of the President of the United States is an immensely\r\ndifficult and complex task. It is unlikely that measures can be devised\r\nto eliminate entirely the multitude of diverse dangers that may arise,\r\nparticularly when the President is traveling in this country or abroad.\r\nThe protective task is further complicated by the reluctance of\r\nPresidents to take security precautions which might interfere with the\r\nperformance of their duties, or their desire to have frequent and easy\r\naccess to the people. The adequacy of existing procedures can fairly\r\nbe assessed only after full consideration of the difficulty of the\r\nprotective assignment, with particular attention to the diverse roles\r\nwhich the President is expected to fill. After reviewing this aspect\r\nof the matter this chapter will set forth the Commission’s conclusions\r\nregarding certain protective measures in force at the time of the\r\nDallas trip and propose recommendations for improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF THE PROTECTIVE ASSIGNMENT\r\n\r\nThe President is Head of State, Chief Executive, Commander in Chief,\r\nand leader of a political party. As the ceremonial head of the\r\nGovernment the President must discharge a wide range of public duties,\r\nnot only in Washington but throughout the land. In this role he\r\nappears to the American people, in the words of William Howard Taft,\r\nas “the personal embodiment and representative of their dignity and\r\nmajesty.”[C8-2] As Chief Executive, the President controls the exercise\r\nof the vast, almost incalculable powers of the executive branch of the\r\nFederal Government. As Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, he must\r\nmaintain ultimate authority over the development and disposition of\r\nour military power. Finally, in accordance with George Washington’s\r\nmaxim that Americans have a government “of accommodation as well as a\r\ngovernment of laws,”[C8-3] it is the President’s right and duty to be\r\nthe active leader of his party, as when he seeks to be reelected or to\r\nmaintain his party in power.\r\n\r\nIn all of these roles the President must go to the people. Exposure of\r\nthe President to public view through travel among the people of this\r\ncountry is a great and historic tradition of American life. Desired\r\nby both the President and the public, it is an indispensable means\r\nof communication between the two. More often than not, Presidential\r\njourneys have served more than one purpose at the same time:\r\nceremonial, administrative, political.\r\n\r\nFrom George Washington to John F. Kennedy, such journeys have been\r\na normal part of the President’s activities. To promote nationwide\r\nacceptance of his administration Washington made grand tours that\r\nserved also to excite interest in the Presidency.[C8-4] In recent\r\nyears, Presidential journeys have been frequent and extensive, partly\r\nbecause of the greater speed and comfort of travel and partly because\r\nof the greater demands made on the President. It is now possible for\r\nPresidents to travel the length and breadth of a land far larger than\r\nthe United States in 1789 in less time than it took George Washington\r\nto travel from New York to Mount Vernon or Thomas Jefferson from\r\nWashington to Monticello. During his Presidency, Franklin D. Roosevelt\r\nmade almost 400 journeys and traveled more than 350,000 miles.[C8-5]\r\nSince 1945, Roosevelt’s successors have ranged the world, and their\r\nforeign journeys have come to be accepted as normal rather than\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nJohn F. Kennedy’s journey to Texas in November 1963 was in this\r\ntradition. His friend and Special Assistant Kenneth O’Donnell, who\r\naccompanied him on his last visit to Dallas, stated the President’s\r\nviews of his responsibilities with simplicity and clarity:\r\n\r\n    The President’s views of his responsibilities as President of\r\n    the United States were that he meet the people, that he go out\r\n    to their homes and see them, and allow them to see him, and\r\n    discuss, if possible, the views of the world as he sees it,\r\n    the problems of the country as he sees them. And he felt that\r\n    leaving Washington for the President of the United States was a\r\n    most necessary--not only for the people, but for the President\r\n    himself, that he expose himself to the actual basic problems\r\n    that were disturbing the American people. It helped him in his\r\n    job here, he was able to come back here with a fresh view of\r\n    many things. I think he felt very strongly that the President\r\n    ought to get out of Washington, and go meet the people on a\r\n    regular basis.[C8-6]\r\n\r\nWhatever their purpose, Presidential journeys have greatly enlarged\r\nand complicated the task of protecting the President. The Secret\r\nService and the Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies\r\nwhich cooperate with it, have been confronted in recent years with\r\nincreasingly difficult problems, created by the greater exposure of the\r\nPresident during his travels and the greater diversity of the audiences\r\nhe must face in a world torn by conflicting ideologies.\r\n\r\nIf the sole goal were to protect the life of the President, it could\r\nbe accomplished with reasonable assurance despite the multiple roles\r\nhe must play. But his very position as representative of the people\r\nprevents him from effectively shielding himself from the people. He\r\ncannot and will not take the precautions of a dictator or a sovereign.\r\nUnder our system, measures must be sought to afford security without\r\nimpeding the President’s performance of his many functions. The\r\nprotection of the President must be thorough but inconspicuous to\r\navoid even the suggestion of a garrison state. The rights of private\r\nindividuals must not be infringed. If the protective job is well done,\r\nits performance will be evident only in the unexceptional fact of its\r\nsuccess. The men in charge of protecting the President, confronted\r\nby complex problems and limited as they are in the measures they may\r\nemploy, must depend upon the utmost cooperation and understanding from\r\nthe public and the President.\r\n\r\nThe problem and the reasonable approach to its solution were ably\r\nstated in a memorandum prepared by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover for the\r\nPresident soon after the assassination:\r\n\r\n    The degree of security that can be afforded the President of\r\n    the United States is dependent to a considerable extent upon\r\n    the degree of contact with the general public desired by the\r\n    President. Absolute security is neither practical nor possible.\r\n    An approach to complete security would require the President to\r\n    operate in a sort of vacuum, isolated from the general public\r\n    and behind impregnable barriers. His travel would be in secret;\r\n    his public appearances would be behind bulletproof glass.\r\n\r\n    A more practical approach necessitates compromise. Any travel,\r\n    any contact with the general public, involves a calculated\r\n    risk on the part of the President and the men responsible for\r\n    his protection. Such risks can be lessened when the President\r\n    recognizes the security problem, has confidence in the\r\n    dedicated Secret Service men who are ready to lay down their\r\n    lives for him and accepts the necessary security precautions\r\n    which they recommend. Many Presidents have been understandably\r\n    impatient with the security precautions which many years\r\n    of experience dictate because these precautions reduce the\r\n    President’s privacy and the access to him of the people of\r\n    the country. Nevertheless the procedures and advice should be\r\n    accepted if the President wishes to have any security.[C8-7]\r\n\r\n\r\nEVALUATION OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION AT THE TIME OF THE ASSASSINATION\r\nOF PRESIDENT KENNEDY\r\n\r\nThe history of Presidential protection shows growing recognition over\r\nthe years that the job must be done by able, dedicated, thoroughly\r\nprofessional personnel, using the best technical equipment that can\r\nbe devised.[C8-8] The assassination of President Kennedy demands an\r\nexamination of the protective measures employed to safeguard him and an\r\ninquiry whether improvements can be made which will reduce the risk of\r\nanother such tragedy. This section considers first the means used to\r\nlocate potential sources of danger to the President in time to take\r\nappropriate precautions. In this connection the information available\r\nto Federal agencies about Lee Harvey Oswald is set out and the reasons\r\nwhy this information was not furnished to the Secret Service appraised.\r\nSecond, the adequacy of other advance preparations for the security of\r\nthe President during his visit to Dallas, largely measures taken by\r\nthe Secret Service, is considered. Finally, the performance of those\r\ncharged with the immediate responsibility of protecting the President\r\non November 22 is reviewed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntelligence Functions Relating to Presidential Protection at the Time\r\nof the Dallas Trip\r\n\r\nA basic element of Presidential protection is the identification and\r\nelimination of possible sources of danger to the President before the\r\ndanger becomes actual. The Secret Service has attempted to perform this\r\nfunction through the activities of its Protective Research Section and\r\nrequests to other agencies, Federal and local, for useful information.\r\nThe Commission has concluded that at the time of the assassination the\r\narrangements relied upon by the Secret Service to perform this function\r\nwere seriously deficient.\r\n\r\n_Adequacy of preventive intelligence operations of the Secret\r\nService._--The main job of the Protective Research Section (PRS) is to\r\ncollect, process, and evaluate information about persons or groups who\r\nmay be a danger to the President. In addition to this function, PRS is\r\nresponsible for such tasks as obtaining clearance of some categories of\r\nWhite House employees and all tradesmen who service the White House,\r\nthe security processing of gifts sent to the President, and technical\r\ninspections against covert listening devices.[C8-9] At the time of the\r\nassassination PRS was a very small group, comprised of 12 specialists\r\nand 3 clerks.[C8-10]\r\n\r\nMany persons call themselves to the attention of PRS by attempting to\r\nvisit the President for bizarre reasons or by writing or in some other\r\nway attempting to communicate with him in a threatening or abusive\r\nmanner or with undue persistence. Robert I. Bouck, special agent in\r\ncharge of PRS, estimated that most of the material received by his\r\noffice originated in this fashion or from the occasional investigations\r\ninitiated by the Secret Service, while the balance was furnished to PRS\r\nby other Federal agencies, with primary source being the FBI.[C8-11]\r\nThe total volume of information received by PRS has risen steadily.\r\nIn 1943 PRS received approximately 9,000 items of information; in\r\n1953 this had increased to more than 17,000 items; in 1963 the total\r\nexceeded 32,000 items.[C8-12] Since many items may pertain to a\r\nsingle case, these figures do not show the caseload. In the period\r\nfrom November 1961 to November 1963, PRS received items in 8,709\r\ncases.[C8-13]\r\n\r\nBefore the assassination of President Kennedy, PRS expressed its\r\ninterest in receiving information on suspects in very general terms.\r\nFor example, PRS instructed the White House mailroom, a source of much\r\nPRS data, to refer all communications on identified existing cases\r\nand, in addition, any communication “that in any way indicates anyone\r\nmay have possible intention of harming the President.”[C8-14] Slightly\r\nmore specific criteria were established for PRS personnel processing\r\nWhite House mail referred by the White House mailroom, but again the\r\nstandards were very general.[C8-15] These instructions to PRS personnel\r\nappear to be the only instance where an effort was made to reduce\r\nthe criteria to writing.[C8-16] When requested to provide a specific\r\nstatement of the standards employed by PRS in deciding what information\r\nto seek and retain, the Secret Service responded:\r\n\r\n    The criteria in effect prior to November 22, 1963, for\r\n    determining whether to accept material for the PRS general\r\n    files were broad and flexible. All material is and was desired,\r\n    accepted, and filed if it indicated or tended to indicate\r\n    that the safety of the President is or might be in danger,\r\n    either at the present or in the future. * * * There are many\r\n    actions, situations, and incidents that may indicate such\r\n    potential danger. Some are specific, such as threats; danger\r\n    may be implied from others, such as membership or activity in\r\n    an organization which believes in assassination as a political\r\n    weapon. All material received by PRS was separately screened\r\n    and a determination made as to whether the information might\r\n    indicate possible harm to the President. If the material\r\n    was evaluated as indicating some potential danger to the\r\n    President--no matter how small--it was indexed in the general\r\n    PRS files under the name of the individual or group of\r\n    individuals to whom that material related.[C8-17]\r\n\r\nThe general files of PRS consist of folders on individuals, card\r\nindexed by name. The files are manually maintained, without use of\r\nany automatic data-processing techniques.[C8-18] At the time of the\r\nassassination, the active PRS general files contained approximately\r\n50,000 cases accumulated over a 20-year period,[C8-19] some of which\r\nincluded more than one individual. A case file was established if the\r\ninformation available suggested that the subject might be a danger\r\nto the President. Many of these cases were not investigated by PRS.\r\nThe case file served merely as a repository for information until\r\nenough had accumulated to warrant an investigation.[C8-20] During\r\nthe period November 1961 to November 1963, PRS investigated 34 newly\r\nestablished or reactivated cases concerning residents of Texas.[C8-21]\r\nMost of these cases involved persons who used threatening language\r\nin communications to or about the President. An additional 115 cases\r\nconcerning Texas residents were established but not investigated.[C8-22]\r\n\r\nWhen PRS learns of an individual whose conduct warrants scrutiny,\r\nit requests an investigation by the closest Secret Service field\r\noffice,[C8-23] of which there are 65 throughout the country. If the\r\nfield office determines that the case should be subject to continuing\r\nreview, PRS establishes a file which requires a checkup at least every\r\n6 months.[C8-24] This might involve a personal interview or interviews\r\nwith members of the person’s household.[C8-25] Wherever possible, the\r\nSecret Service arranges for the family and friends of the individual,\r\nand local law enforcement officials, to advise the field office if\r\nthe subject displays signs of increased danger or plans to leave his\r\nhome area. At the time of the assassination there were approximately\r\n400 persons throughout the country who were subject to periodic\r\nreview.[C8-26]\r\n\r\nIf PRS concludes after investigation that an individual presents a\r\nsignificant danger to the life of the President, his name is placed in\r\na “trip index file” which is maintained on a geographical field office\r\nbasis.[C8-27] At the time of the assassination the names of about 100\r\npersons were in this index, all of whom were included in the group of\r\n400 being reviewed regularly.[C8-28] PRS also maintains an album of\r\nphotographs and descriptions of about 12 to 15 individuals who are\r\nregarded as clear risks to the President and who do not have a fixed\r\nplace of residence.[C8-29] Members of the White House detail of the\r\nSecret Service have copies of this album.[C8-30]\r\n\r\nIndividuals who are regarded as dangerous to the President and who\r\nare in penal or hospital custody are listed only in the general\r\nfiles of PRS, but there is a system for the immediate notification\r\nof the Secret Service by the confining institution when a subject is\r\nreleased or escapes.[C8-31] PRS attempts to eliminate serious risks by\r\nhospitalization or, where necessary, the prosecution of persons who\r\nhave committed an offense such as threatening the President.[C8-32]\r\nIn June 1964 PRS had arrangements to be notified about the release or\r\nescape of approximately 1,000 persons.[C8-33]\r\n\r\nIn summary, at the time of the assassination PRS had received, over\r\na 20-year period, basic information on some 50,000 cases; it had\r\narrangements to be notified about release from confinement in roughly\r\n1,000 cases; it had established periodic regular review of the status\r\nof 400 individuals; it regarded approximately 100 of these 400 cases\r\nas serious risks and 12 to 15 of these cases as highly dangerous\r\nrisks. Members of the White House detail were expected to familiarize\r\nthemselves with the descriptions and photographs of the highest risk\r\ncases. The cases subject to periodic review and the 100 or so cases\r\nin the higher risk category were filed on a geographic basis, and\r\ncould conveniently be reviewed by a Secret Service agent preparing\r\nfor a Presidential trip to a particular part of the country. These\r\nwere the files reviewed by PRS on November 8, 1963, at the request of\r\nSpecial Agent Lawson, advance agent for President Kennedy’s trip to\r\nDallas.[C8-34] The general files of PRS were not indexed by geographic\r\nlocation and were of little use in preparing for a Presidential visit\r\nto a specific locality.\r\n\r\nSecret Service requests to other agencies for intelligence information\r\nwere no more specific than the broad and general instructions to its\r\nown agents and the White House mailroom. The head of PRS testified\r\nthat the Secret Service requested other agencies to provide “any and\r\nall information that they may come in contact with that would indicate\r\ndanger to the President.”[C8-35] These requests were not communicated\r\nin writing by the Secret Service; rather, the Service depended on the\r\npersonal liaison maintained by PRS with the headquarters of the Federal\r\nintelligence agencies, particularly the FBI, and at the working level\r\nwith personnel of the field offices of the various agencies.[C8-36]\r\nThe Service frequently participated in the training programs of other\r\nlaw enforcement agencies, and agents from other agencies attended the\r\nregular Secret Service training schools. Presidential protection was an\r\nimportant topic in these training programs.[C8-37]\r\n\r\nIn the absence of more specific instructions, other Federal\r\nagencies interpreted the Secret Service’s informal requests to\r\nrelate principally to overt threats to harm the President or other\r\nspecific manifestations of hostility. For example, at the time of the\r\nassassination, the FBI Handbook, which is in the possession of every\r\nBureau special agent, provided:\r\n\r\n    Threats against the President of the U.S., members of his\r\n    immediate family, the President-elect, and the Vice-President\r\n\r\n    Investigation of threats against the President of the United\r\n    States, members of his immediate family, the President-Elect,\r\n    and the Vice-President is within the exclusive jurisdiction\r\n    of the U.S. Secret Service. Any information indicating the\r\n    possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the\r\n    President, members of the immediate family of the President,\r\n    the President-Elect or the Vice-President must be referred\r\n    immediately by the most expeditious means of communication\r\n    to the nearest office of the U.S. Secret Service. Advise the\r\n    Bureau at the same time by teletype of the information so\r\n    furnished to the Secret Service and the fact that it has been\r\n    so disseminated. The above action should be taken without delay\r\n    in order to attempt to verify the information and no evaluation\r\n    of the information should be attempted. When the threat is\r\n    in the form of a written communication, give a copy to local\r\n    Secret Service and forward the original to the Bureau where\r\n    it will be made available to Secret Service headquarters in\r\n    Washington. The referral of the copy to local Secret Service\r\n    should not delay the immediate referral of the information by\r\n    the fastest available means of communication to Secret Service\r\n    locally.[C8-38]\r\n\r\nThe State Department advised the Secret Service of all crank and\r\nthreat letter mail or crank visitors and furnished reports concerning\r\nany assassination or attempted assassination of a ruler or other\r\nmajor official anywhere in the world.[C8-39] The several military\r\nintelligence agencies reported crank mail and similar threats involving\r\nthe President.[C8-40] According to Special Agent in Charge Bouck, the\r\nSecret Service had no standard procedure for the systematic review\r\nof its requests for and receipt of information from other Federal\r\nagencies.[C8-41]\r\n\r\nThe Commission believes that the facilities and procedures of the\r\nProtective Research Section of the Secret Service prior to November\r\n22, 1963, were inadequate. Its efforts appear to have been too largely\r\ndirected at the “crank” threat. Although the Service recognized that\r\nits advance preventive measures must encompass more than these most\r\nobvious dangers, it made little effort to identify factors in the\r\nactivities of an individual or an organized group, other than specific\r\nthreats, which suggested a source of danger against which timely\r\nprecautions could be taken. Except for its special “trip index” file of\r\n400 names, none of the cases in the PRS general files was available for\r\nsystematic review on a geographic basis when the President planned a\r\nparticular trip.\r\n\r\nAs reported in chapter II, when the special file was reviewed on\r\nNovember 8, it contained the names of no persons from the entire\r\nDallas-Fort Worth area, notwithstanding the fact that Ambassador\r\nStevenson had been abused by pickets in Dallas less than a month\r\nbefore. Bouck explained the failure to try to identify the individuals\r\ninvolved in the Stevenson incident after it occurred on the ground that\r\nPRS required a more direct indication of a threat to the President, and\r\nthat there was no such indication until the President’s scheduled visit\r\nto that area became known.[C8-42] Such an approach seriously undermines\r\nthe precautionary nature of PRS work; if the presence in Dallas of the\r\nStevenson pickets might have created a danger for the President on a\r\nvisit to that city, PRS should have investigated and been prepared to\r\nguard against it.\r\n\r\nOther agencies occasionally provided information to the Secret Service\r\nconcerning potentially dangerous political groups. This was done in the\r\ncase of the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, for example, but only\r\nafter members of the group had resorted to political violence.[C8-43]\r\nHowever, the vague requests for information which the Secret Service\r\nmade to Federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies were not\r\nwell designed to elicit information from them about persons other than\r\nthose who were obvious threats to the President. The requests shifted\r\nthe responsibility for evaluating difficult cases from the Service,\r\nthe agency most responsible for performing that task, to the other\r\nagencies. No specific guidance was provided. Although the CIA had on\r\nfile requests from the Treasury Department for information on the\r\ncounterfeiting of U.S. currency and certain smuggling matters,[C8-44]\r\nit had no written specification of intelligence information collected\r\nby CIA abroad which was desired by the Secret Service in advance of\r\nPresidential trips outside the United States.\r\n\r\n_Information known about Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the\r\nassassination._--No information concerning Lee Harvey Oswald appeared\r\nin PRS files before the President’s trip to Dallas. Oswald was known\r\nto other Federal agencies with which the Secret Service maintained\r\nintelligence liaison. The FBI had been interested in him, to some\r\ndegree at least, since the time of his defection in October 1959.\r\nIt had interviewed him twice shortly after his return to the United\r\nStates, again a year later at his request and was investigating\r\nhim at the time of the assassination. The Commission has taken the\r\ntestimony of Bureau agents who interviewed Oswald after his return\r\nfrom the Soviet Union and prior to November 22, 1963, the agent\r\nwho was assigned his case at the time of the assassination, the\r\nDirector of the FBI, and the Assistant to the Director in charge\r\nof all investigative activities under the Director and Associate\r\nDirector.[C8-45] In addition, the Director and Deputy Director for\r\nPlans of the CIA testified concerning that Agency’s limited knowledge\r\nof Oswald before the assassination.[C8-46] Finally, the Commission has\r\nreviewed the complete files on Oswald, as they existed at the time of\r\nthe assassination, of the Department of State, the Office of Naval\r\nIntelligence, the FBI, and the CIA. The information known to the FBI is\r\nsummarized below.\r\n\r\n_From defection to return to Fort Worth._--The FBI opened a file\r\non Oswald in October 1959,[C8-47] when news reports appeared of\r\nhis defection to the Soviet Union.[C8-48] The file was opened\r\n“for the purpose of correlating information inasmuch as he was\r\nconsidered a possible security risk in the event he returned to this\r\ncountry.”[C8-49] Oswald’s defection was also the occasion for the\r\nopening of files by the Department of State, CIA, and the Office of\r\nNaval Intelligence. Until April 1960, FBI activity consisted of placing\r\nin Oswald’s file information regarding his relations with the U.S.\r\nEmbassy in Moscow and background data relating largely to his prior\r\nmilitary service, provided by other agencies. In April 1960, Mrs.\r\nMarguerite Oswald and Robert Oswald were interviewed in the course of a\r\nroutine FBI investigation of transfers of small sums of money from Mrs.\r\nOswald to her son in Russia.[C8-50]\r\n\r\nDuring the next 2 years the FBI continued to accumulate information,\r\nand kept itself informed on Oswald’s status by periodic reviews of\r\nState Department and Office of Naval Intelligence files. In this way,\r\nit learned that when Oswald had arrived in the Soviet Union he had\r\nattempted to renounce his U.S. citizenship and applied for Soviet\r\ncitizenship, had described himself as a Marxist, had said he would\r\ngive the Soviet Union any useful information he had acquired as a\r\nmarine radar technician and had displayed an arrogant and aggressive\r\nattitude at the U.S. Embassy; it learned also that Oswald had been\r\ndischarged from the Marine Corps Reserve as undesirable in August\r\n1960.[C8-51] In June 1962, the Bureau was advised by the Department of\r\nState of Oswald’s plan to return to the United States. The Bureau made\r\narrangements to be advised by immigration authorities of his return,\r\nand instructed the Dallas office to interview him when he got back\r\nto determine whether he had been recruited by a Soviet intelligence\r\nservice.[C8-52] Oswald’s file at the Department of State Passport\r\nOffice was reviewed in June 1962. It revealed his letter of January\r\n30, 1962, to Secretary of the Navy Connally, in which he protested his\r\ndischarge and declared that he would use “all means” to correct it.\r\nThe file reflected the Department’s determination that Oswald had not\r\nexpatriated himself.[C8-53]\r\n\r\n_From return to Fort Worth to move to New Orleans._--Oswald was first\r\ninterviewed by FBI Agents John W. Fain and B. Tom Carter on June 26,\r\n1962, in Fort Worth.[C8-54] Agent Fain reported to headquarters that\r\nOswald was impatient and arrogant, and unwilling to answer questions\r\nregarding his motive for going to the Soviet Union. Oswald “denied\r\nthat he had ever denounced his U.S. citizenship, and * * * that he had\r\never applied for Soviet citizenship specifically.”[C8-55] Oswald was,\r\nhowever, willing to discuss his contacts with Soviet authorities. He\r\ndenied having any involvement with Soviet intelligence agencies and\r\npromised to advise the FBI if he heard from them.[C8-56]\r\n\r\nAgent Fain was not satisfied by this interview and arranged to\r\nsee Oswald again on August 16, 1962.[C8-57] According to Fain’s\r\ncontemporaneous memorandum and his present recollection, while Oswald\r\nremained somewhat evasive at this interview, he was not antagonistic\r\nand seemed generally to be settling down.[C8-58] (Marina Oswald,\r\nhowever, recalled that her husband was upset by this interview.)[C8-59]\r\nOswald again agreed to advise the FBI if he were approached under\r\nsuspicious circumstances; however, he deprecated the possibility of\r\nthis happening, particularly since his employment did not involve any\r\nsensitive information.[C8-60] Having concluded that Oswald was not a\r\nsecurity risk or potentially dangerous or violent, Fain determined that\r\nnothing further remained to be done at that time and recommended that\r\nthe case be placed in a closed status.[C8-61] This is an administrative\r\nclassification indicating that no further work has been scheduled. It\r\ndoes not preclude the agent in charge of the case from reopening it if\r\nhe feels that further work should be done.[C8-62]\r\n\r\nFrom August 1962 until March 1963, the FBI continued to accumulate\r\ninformation regarding Oswald but engaged in no active investigation.\r\nAgent Fain retired from the FBI in October 1962, and the closed\r\nOswald case was not reassigned.[C8-63] However, pursuant to a\r\nregular Bureau practice of interviewing certain immigrants from Iron\r\nCurtain countries, Fain had been assigned to see Marina Oswald at an\r\nappropriate time.[C8-64] This assignment was given to Agent James\r\nP. Hosty, Jr. of the Dallas office upon Fain’s retirement. In March\r\n1963, while attempting to locate Marina Oswald, Agent Hosty was told\r\nby Mrs. M. F. Tobias, a former landlady of the Oswalds at 602 Elsbeth\r\nStreet in Dallas, that other tenants had complained because Oswald was\r\ndrinking to excess and beating his wife.[C8-65] This information led\r\nHosty to review Oswald’s file, from which he learned that Oswald had\r\nbecome a subscriber to the Worker, a Communist Party publication. Hosty\r\ndecided that the Lee Harvey Oswald case should be reopened because of\r\nthe alleged personal difficulties and the contact with the Worker, and\r\nhis recommendation was accepted.[C8-66] He decided, however, not to\r\ninterview Marina Oswald at that time, and merely determined that the\r\nOswalds were living at 214 Neely Street in Dallas.[C8-67]\r\n\r\nOn April 21, 1963, the FBI field office in New York was advised\r\nthat Oswald was in contact with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in\r\nNew York, and that he had written to the committee stating that he\r\nhad distributed its pamphlets on the streets of Dallas.[C8-68] This\r\ninformation did not reach Agent Hosty in Dallas until June.[C8-69]\r\nHosty considered the information to be “stale” by that time, and did\r\nnot attempt to verify Oswald’s reported statement.[C8-70] Under a\r\ngeneral Bureau request to be on the alert for activities of the Fair\r\nPlay for Cuba Committee, Hosty had inquired earlier and found no\r\nevidence that it was functioning in the Dallas area.[C8-71]\r\n\r\n_In New Orleans._--In the middle of May of 1963, Agent Hosty checked\r\nOswald’s last known residence and found that he had moved.[C8-72]\r\nOswald was tentatively located in New Orleans in June, and Hosty asked\r\nthe New Orleans FBI office to determine Oswald’s address and what he\r\nwas doing.[C8-73] The New Orleans office investigated and located\r\nOswald, learning his address and former place of employment on August\r\n5, 1963.[C8-74] A confidential informant advised the FBI that Oswald\r\nwas not known to be engaged in Communist Party activities in New\r\nOrleans.[C8-75]\r\n\r\nOn June 24, Oswald applied in New Orleans for a passport, stating that\r\nhe planned to depart by ship for an extended tour of Western European\r\ncountries, the Soviet Union, Finland, and Poland. The Passport Office\r\nof the Department of State in Washington had no listing for Oswald\r\nrequiring special treatment, and his application was approved on the\r\nfollowing day.[C8-76] The FBI had not asked to be informed of any\r\neffort by Oswald to obtain a passport, as it might have under existing\r\nprocedures, and did not know of his application.[C8-77] According to\r\nthe Bureau,\r\n\r\n    We did not request the State Department to include Oswald\r\n    on a list which would have resulted in advising us of any\r\n    application for a passport inasmuch as the facts relating to\r\n    Oswald’s activities at that time did not warrant such action.\r\n    Our investigation of Oswald had disclosed no evidence that\r\n    Oswald was acting under the instructions or on behalf of any\r\n    foreign government or instrumentality thereof.[C8-78]\r\n\r\nOn August 9, 1963, Oswald was arrested and jailed by the New Orleans\r\nPolice Department for disturbing the peace, in connection with a street\r\nfight which broke out when he was accosted by anti-Castro Cubans while\r\ndistributing leaflets on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. On\r\nthe next day, he asked the New Orleans police to arrange for him to be\r\ninterviewed by the FBI. The police called the local FBI office and an\r\nagent, John L. Quigley, was sent to the police station.[C8-79] Agent\r\nQuigley did not know of Oswald’s prior FBI record when he interviewed\r\nhim, inasmuch as the police had not given Oswald’s name to the Bureau\r\nwhen they called the office.[C8-80]\r\n\r\nQuigley recalled that Oswald was receptive when questioned about his\r\ngeneral background but less than completely truthful or cooperative\r\nwhen interrogated about the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Quigley\r\ntestified:\r\n\r\n    When I began asking him specific details with respect to\r\n    his activities in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New\r\n    Orleans as to where meetings were held, who was involved, what\r\n    occurred, he was reticent to furnish information, reluctant and\r\n    actually as far as I was concerned, was completely evasive on\r\n    them.[C8-81]\r\n\r\nIn Quigley’s judgment, Oswald “was probably making a self-serving\r\nstatement in attempting to explain to me why he was distributing this\r\nliterature, and for no other reason, and when I got to questioning him\r\nfurther then he felt that his purpose had been served and he wouldn’t\r\nsay anything further.”[C8-82]\r\n\r\nDuring the interview Quigley obtained background information from\r\nOswald which was inconsistent with information already in the\r\nBureau’s possession. When Quigley returned to his office, he learned\r\nthat another Bureau agent, Milton R. Kaack, had been conducting a\r\nbackground investigation of Oswald at the request of Agent Hosty\r\nin Dallas. Quigley advised Kaack of his interview and gave him a\r\ndetailed memorandum.[C8-83] Kaack was aware of the facts known to the\r\nFBI and recognized Oswald’s false statements.[C8-84] For example,\r\nOswald claimed that his wife’s maiden name was Prossa and that they\r\nhad been married in Fort Worth and lived there until coming to New\r\nOrleans.[C8-85] He had told the New Orleans arresting officers that he\r\nhad been born in Cuba.[C8-86]\r\n\r\nSeveral days later, the Bureau received additional evidence that Oswald\r\nhad lied to Agent Quigley. On August 22, it learned that Oswald had\r\nappeared on a radio discussion program on August 21.[C8-87] William\r\nStuckey, who had appeared on the radio program with Oswald, told the\r\nBureau on August 30 that Oswald had told him that he had worked and\r\nbeen married in the Soviet Union.[C8-88] Neither these discrepancies\r\nnor the fact that Oswald had initiated the FBI interview was considered\r\nsufficiently unusual to necessitate another interview.[C8-89] Alan H.\r\nBelmont, Assistant to the Director of the FBI, stated the Bureau’s\r\nreasoning in this way:\r\n\r\n    Our interest in this man at this point was to determine whether\r\n    his activities constituted a threat to the internal security of\r\n    the country. It was apparent that he had made a self-serving\r\n    statement to Agent Quigley. It became a matter of record in\r\n    our files as a part of the case, and if we determined that the\r\n    course of the investigation required us to clarify or face him\r\n    down with this information, we would do it at the appropriate\r\n    time.\r\n\r\n    In other words, he committed no violation of the law by telling\r\n    us something that wasn’t true, and unless this required further\r\n    investigation at that time, we would handle it in due course,\r\n    in accord with the whole context of the investigation.[C8-90]\r\n\r\nOn August 21, 1963, Bureau headquarters instructed the New Orleans\r\nand Dallas field offices to conduct an additional investigation of\r\nOswald in view of the activities which had led to his arrest.[C8-91]\r\nFBI informants in the New Orleans area, familiar with pro-Castro or\r\nCommunist Party activity there, advised the Bureau that Oswald was\r\nunknown in such circles.[C8-92]\r\n\r\n_In Dallas._--In early September 1963 the FBI transferred the principal\r\nresponsibility for the Oswald case from the Dallas office to the\r\nNew Orleans office.[C8-93] Soon after, on October 1, 1963, the FBI\r\nwas advised by the rental agent for the Oswalds’ apartment in New\r\nOrleans that they had moved again.[C8-94] According to the information\r\nreceived by the Bureau they had vacated their apartment, and Marina\r\nOswald had departed with their child in a station wagon with Texas\r\nregistration.[C8-95] On October 3, Hosty reopened the case in Dallas\r\nto assist the New Orleans office.[C8-96] He checked in Oswald’s old\r\nneighborhood and throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area but was unable\r\nto locate Oswald.[C8-97]\r\n\r\nThe next word about Oswald’s location was a communication from the\r\nCIA to the FBI on October 10, advising that an individual tentatively\r\nidentified as Oswald had been in touch with the Soviet Embassy in\r\nMexico City in early October of 1963.[C8-98] The Bureau had had no\r\nearlier information suggesting that Oswald had left the United States.\r\nThe possible contact with the Soviet Embassy in Mexico intensified\r\nthe FBI’s interest in learning Oswald’s whereabouts.[C8-99] The FBI\r\nrepresentative in Mexico City arranged to follow up this information\r\nwith the CIA and to verify Oswald’s entry into Mexico.[C8-100] The CIA\r\nmessage was sent also to the Department of State where it was reviewed\r\nby personnel of the Passport Office, who knew from Oswald’s file that\r\nhe had sought and obtained a passport on June 25, 1963.[C8-101] The\r\nDepartment of State did not advise either the CIA or the FBI of these\r\nfacts.[C8-102]\r\n\r\nOn October 25, the New Orleans office of the FBI learned that in\r\nSeptember Oswald had given a forwarding address of 2515 West Fifth\r\nStreet, Irving, Tex.[C8-103] After receiving this information on\r\nOctober 29, Agent Hosty attempted to locate Oswald. On the same day\r\nHosty interviewed neighbors on Fifth Street and learned that the\r\naddress was that of Mrs. Ruth Paine.[C8-104] He conducted a limited\r\nbackground investigation of the Paines, intending to interview Mrs.\r\nPaine and ask her particularly about Oswald’s whereabouts.[C8-105]\r\n\r\nHaving determined that Mrs. Paine was a responsible and reliable\r\ncitizen, Hosty interviewed her on November 1. The interview lasted\r\nabout 20-25 minutes.[C8-106] In response to Hosty’s inquiries, Mrs.\r\nPaine\r\n\r\n    * * * readily admitted that Mrs. Marina Oswald and Lee Oswald’s\r\n    two children were staying with her. She said that Lee Oswald\r\n    was living somewhere in Dallas. She didn’t know where. She said\r\n    it was in the Oak Cliff area but she didn’t have his address.\r\n\r\n    I asked her if she knew where he worked. After a moment’s\r\n    hesitation, she told me that he worked at the Texas School\r\n    Book Depository near the downtown area of Dallas. She didn’t\r\n    have the exact address, and it is my recollection that we went\r\n    to the phone book and looked it up, found it to be 411 Elm\r\n    Street.[C8-107]\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine told Hosty also that Oswald was living alone in Dallas\r\nbecause she did not want him staying at her house, although she was\r\nwilling to let Oswald visit his wife and children.[C8-108] According to\r\nHosty, Mrs. Paine indicated that she thought she could find out where\r\nOswald was living and would let him know.[C8-109] At this point in the\r\ninterview, Hosty gave Mrs. Paine his name and office telephone number\r\non a piece of paper.[C8-110] At the end of the interview, Marina Oswald\r\ncame into the room. When he observed that she seemed “quite alarmed”\r\nabout the visit, Hosty assured her, through Mrs. Paine as interpreter,\r\nthat the FBI would not harm or harass her.[C8-111]\r\n\r\nOn November 4, Hosty telephoned the Texas School Book Depository and\r\nlearned that Oswald was working there and that he had given as his\r\naddress Mrs. Paine’s residence in Irving.[C8-112] Hosty took the\r\nnecessary steps to have the Dallas office of the FBI, rather than\r\nthe New Orleans office, reestablished as the office with principal\r\nresponsibility.[C8-113] On November 5, Hosty was traveling near Mrs.\r\nPaine’s home and took the occasion to stop by to ask whether she had\r\nany further information. Mrs. Paine had nothing to add to what she had\r\nalready told him, except that during a visit that past weekend, Oswald\r\nhad said that he was a “Trotskyite Communist,” and that she found\r\nthis and similar statements illogical and somewhat amusing.[C8-114]\r\nOn this occasion Hosty was at the Paine residence for only a few\r\nminutes.[C8-115]\r\n\r\nDuring neither interview did Hosty learn Oswald’s address or telephone\r\nnumber in Dallas. Mrs. Paine testified that she learned Oswald’s\r\ntelephone number at the Beckley Street roominghouse in the middle\r\nof October shortly after Oswald rented the room on October 14. As\r\ndiscussed in chapter VI, she failed to report this to Agent Hosty\r\nbecause she thought the FBI was in possession of a great deal of\r\ninformation and certainly would find it very easy to learn where Oswald\r\nwas living.[C8-116]\r\n\r\nHosty did nothing further in connection with the Oswald case until\r\nafter the assassination. On November 1, 1963, he had received a\r\ncopy of the report of the New Orleans office which contained Agent\r\nQuigley’s memorandum of the interview in the New Orleans jail on August\r\n10,[C8-117] and realized immediately that Oswald had given false\r\nbiographic information.[C8-118] Hosty knew that he would eventually\r\nhave to investigate this, and “was quite interested in determining the\r\nnature of his contact with the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City.”[C8-119]\r\nWhen asked what his next step would have been, Hosty replied:\r\n\r\n    Well, as I had previously stated, I have between 25 and 40\r\n    cases assigned to me at any one time. I had other matters to\r\n    take care of. I had now established that Lee Oswald was not\r\n    employed in a sensitive industry. I can now afford to wait\r\n    until New Orleans forwarded the necessary papers to me to\r\n    show me I now had all the information. It was then my plan to\r\n    interview Marina Oswald in detail concerning both herself and\r\n    her husband’s background.\r\n\r\n    Q. Had you planned any steps beyond that point?\r\n\r\n    A. No. I would have to wait until I had talked to Marina to see\r\n    what I could determine, and from there I could make my plans.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you take any action on this case between November 5 and\r\n    November 22?\r\n\r\n    A. No, sir.[C8-120]\r\n\r\nThe official Bureau files confirm Hosty’s statement that from\r\nNovember 5 until the assassination, no active investigation was\r\nconducted.[C8-121] On November 18 the FBI learned that Oswald recently\r\nhad been in communication with the Soviet Embassy in Washington and so\r\nadvised the Dallas office in the ordinary course of business. Hosty\r\nreceived this information on the afternoon of November 22, 1963.[C8-122]\r\n\r\n_Nonreferral of Oswald to the Secret Service._--The Commission has\r\nconsidered carefully the question whether the FBI, in view of all\r\nthe information concerning Oswald in its files, should have alerted\r\nthe Secret Service to Oswald’s presence in Dallas prior to President\r\nKennedy’s visit. The Secret Service and the FBI differ as to whether\r\nOswald fell within the category of “threats against the President”\r\nwhich should be referred to the Service.\r\n\r\nRobert I. Bouck, special agent in charge of the Protective Research\r\nSection, testified that the information available to the Federal\r\nGovernment about Oswald before the assassination would, if known\r\nto PRS, have made Oswald a subject of concern to the Secret\r\nService.[C8-123] Bouck pointed to a number of characteristics besides\r\nOswald’s defection the cumulative effect of which would have been to\r\nalert the Secret Service to potential danger:\r\n\r\n    I would think his continued association with the Russian\r\n    Embassy after his return, his association with the Castro\r\n    groups would have been of concern to us, a knowledge that he\r\n    had, I believe, been courtmartialed for illegal possession\r\n    of a gun, of a hand gun in the Marines, that he had owned a\r\n    weapon and did a good deal of hunting or use of it, perhaps\r\n    in Russia, plus a number of items about his disposition and\r\n    unreliability of character, I think all of those, if we had had\r\n    them altogether, would have added up to pointing out a pretty\r\n    bad individual, and I think that, together, had we known that\r\n    he had a vantage point would have seemed somewhat serious to\r\n    us, even though I must admit that none of these in themselves\r\n    would be--would meet our specific criteria, none of them alone.\r\n\r\n    But it is when you begin adding them up to some degree that you\r\n    begin to get criteria that are meaningful.[C8-124]\r\n\r\nMr. Bouck pointed out, however, that he had no reason to believe that\r\nany one Federal agency had access to all this information, including\r\nthe significant fact that Oswald was employed in a building which\r\noverlooked the motorcade route.[C8-125]\r\n\r\nAgent Hosty testified that he was fully aware of the pending\r\nPresidential visit to Dallas. He recalled that the special agent\r\nin charge of the Dallas office of the FBI, J. Gordon Shanklin, had\r\ndiscussed the President’s visit on several occasions, including the\r\nregular biweekly conference on the morning of November 22:\r\n\r\n    Mr. Shanklin advised us, among other things, that in view\r\n    of the President’s visit to Dallas, that if anyone had any\r\n    indication of any possibility of any acts of violence or any\r\n    demonstrations against the President, or Vice President,\r\n    to immediately notify the Secret Service and confirm it in\r\n    writing. He had made the same statement about a week prior at\r\n    another special conference which we had held. I don’t recall\r\n    the exact date. It was about a week prior.[C8-126]\r\n\r\nIn fact, Hosty participated in transmitting to the Secret Service two\r\npieces of information pertaining to the visit.[C8-127] Hosty testified\r\nthat he did not know until the evening of Thursday, November 21,\r\nthat there was to be a motorcade, however, and never realized that\r\nthe motorcade would pass the Texas School Book Depository Building.\r\nHe testified that he did not read the newspaper story describing the\r\nmotorcade route in detail, since he was interested only in the fact\r\nthat the motorcade was coming up Main Street, “where maybe I could\r\nwatch it if I had a chance.”[C8-128]\r\n\r\nEven if he had recalled that Oswald’s place of employment was on the\r\nPresident’s route, Hosty testified that he would not have cited him\r\nto the Secret Service as a potential threat to the President.[C8-129]\r\nHosty interpreted his instructions as requiring “some indication\r\nthat the person planned to take some action against the safety of\r\nthe President of the United States or the Vice President.”[C8-130]\r\nIn his opinion, none of the information in the FBI files--Oswald’s\r\ndefection, his Fair Play for Cuba activities in New Orleans, his lies\r\nto Agent Quigley, his recent visit to Mexico City--indicated that\r\nOswald was capable of violence.[C8-131] Hosty’s initial reaction on\r\nhearing that Oswald was a suspect in the assassination, was “shock,\r\ncomplete surprise,” because he had no reason to believe that Oswald\r\n“was capable or potentially an assassin of the President of the United\r\nStates.”[C8-132]\r\n\r\nShortly after Oswald was apprehended and identified, Hosty’s superior\r\nsent him to observe the interrogation of Oswald.[C8-133] Hosty parked\r\nhis car in the basement of police headquarters and there met an\r\nacquaintance, Lt. Jack Revill of the Dallas police force. The two men\r\ndisagree about the conversation which took place between them. They\r\nagree that Hosty told Revill that the FBI had known about Oswald and,\r\nin particular, of his presence in Dallas and his employment at the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building.[C8-134] Revill testified that\r\nHosty said also that the FBI had information that Oswald was “capable\r\nof committing this assassination.”[C8-135] According to Revill, Hosty\r\nindicated that he was going to tell this to Lieutenant Wells of the\r\nhomicide and robbery bureau.[C8-136] Revill promptly made a memorandum\r\nof this conversation in which the quoted statement appears.[C8-137]\r\nHis secretary testified that she prepared such a report for him that\r\nafternoon[C8-138] and Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry and District\r\nAttorney Henry M. Wade both testified that they saw it later that\r\nday.[C8-139]\r\n\r\nHosty has unequivocally denied, first by affidavit and then in his\r\ntestimony before the Commission, that he ever said that Oswald was\r\ncapable of violence, or that he had any information suggesting\r\nthis.[C8-140] The only witness to the conversation was Dallas Police\r\nDetective V. J. Brian, who was accompanying Revill. Brian did not hear\r\nHosty make any statement concerning Oswald’s capacity to be an assassin\r\nbut he did not hear the entire conversation because of the commotion at\r\npolice headquarters and because he was not within hearing distance at\r\nall times.[C8-141]\r\n\r\nHosty’s interpretation of the prevailing FBI instructions on referrals\r\nto the Secret Service was defended before the Commission by his\r\nsuperiors. After summarizing the Bureau’s investigative interest in\r\nOswald prior to the assassination, J. Edgar Hoover concluded that\r\n“There was nothing up to the time of the assassination that gave any\r\nindication that this man was a dangerous character who might do harm\r\nto the President or to the Vice President.”[C8-142] Director Hoover\r\nemphasized that the first indication of Oswald’s capacity for violence\r\nwas his attempt on General Walker’s life, which did not become known\r\nto the FBI until after the assassination.[C8-143] Both Director Hoover\r\nand his assistant, Alan H. Belmont, stressed also the decision by the\r\nDepartment of State that Oswald should be permitted to return to the\r\nUnited States.[C8-144] Neither believed that the Bureau investigation\r\nof him up to November 22 revealed any information which would have\r\njustified referral to the Secret Service. According to Belmont, when\r\nOswald returned from the Soviet Union,\r\n\r\n    * * * he indicated that he had learned his lesson, was\r\n    disenchanted with Russia, and had a renewed concept--I am\r\n    paraphrasing, a renewed concept--of the American free society.\r\n\r\n    We talked to him twice. He likewise indicated he was\r\n    disenchanted with Russia. We satisfied ourselves that we had\r\n    met our requirement, namely to find out whether he had been\r\n    recruited by Soviet intelligence. The case was closed.\r\n\r\n    We again exhibited interest on the basis of these contacts with\r\n    The Worker, Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which are relatively\r\n    inconsequential.\r\n\r\n    His activities for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New\r\n    Orleans, we knew, were not of real consequence as he was not\r\n    connected with any organized activity there.\r\n\r\n    The interview with him in jail is not significant from the\r\n    standpoint of whether he had a propensity for violence.\r\n\r\n    Q. This is the Quigley interview you are talking about?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes; it was a self-serving interview.\r\n\r\n    The visits with the Soviet Embassy were evidently for the\r\n    purpose of securing a visa, and he had told us during one\r\n    of the interviews that he would probably take his wife back\r\n    to Soviet Russia some time in the future. He had come back\r\n    to Dallas. Hosty had established that he had a job, he was\r\n    working, and had told Mrs. Paine that when he got the money he\r\n    was going to take an apartment when the baby was old enough,\r\n    he was going to take an apartment, and the family would live\r\n    together.\r\n\r\n    He gave evidence of settling down. Nowhere during the course\r\n    of this investigation or the information that came to us from\r\n    other agencies was there any indication of a potential for\r\n    violence on his part.\r\n\r\n    Consequently, there was no basis for Hosty to go to Secret\r\n    Service and advise them of Oswald’s presence. * * *[C8-145]\r\n\r\nAs reflected in this testimony, the officials of the FBI believed that\r\nthere was no data in its files which gave warning that Oswald was a\r\nsource of danger to President Kennedy. While he had expressed hostility\r\nat times toward the State Department, the Marine Corps, and the FBI\r\nas agents of the Government,[C8-146] so far as the FBI knew he had\r\nnot shown any potential for violence. Prior to November 22, 1963, no\r\nlaw enforcement agency had any information to connect Oswald with the\r\nattempted shooting of General Walker. It was against this background\r\nand consistent with the criteria followed by the FBI prior to November\r\n22 that agents of the FBI in Dallas did not consider Oswald’s presence\r\nin the Texas School Book Depository Building overlooking the motorcade\r\nroute as a source of danger to the President and did not inform the\r\nSecret Service of his employment in the Depository Building.\r\n\r\nThe Commission believes, however, that the FBI took an unduly\r\nrestrictive view of its responsibilities in preventive intelligence\r\nwork, prior to the assassination. The Commission appreciates the\r\nlarge volume of cases handled by the FBI (636,371 investigative\r\nmatters during fiscal year 1963).[C8-147] There were no Secret Service\r\ncriteria which specifically required the referral of Oswald’s case\r\nto the Secret Service; nor was there any requirement to report the\r\nnames of defectors. However, there was much material in the hands of\r\nthe FBI about Oswald: the knowledge of his defection, his arrogance\r\nand hostility to the United States, his pro-Castro tendencies, his\r\nlies when interrogated by the FBI, his trip to Mexico where he was\r\nin contact with Soviet authorities, his presence in the School Book\r\nDepository job and its location along the route of the motorcade. All\r\nthis does seem to amount to enough to have induced an alert agency,\r\nsuch as the FBI, possessed of this information to list Oswald as a\r\npotential threat to the safety of the President. This conclusion may be\r\ntinged with hindsight, but it stated primarily to direct the thought\r\nof those responsible for the future safety of our Presidents to the\r\nneed for a more imaginative and less narrow interpretation of their\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\nIt is the conclusion of the Commission that, even in the absence of\r\nSecret Service criteria which specifically required the referral\r\nof such a case as Oswald’s to the Secret Service, a more alert and\r\ncarefully considered treatment of the Oswald case by the Bureau might\r\nhave brought about such a referral. Had such a review been undertaken\r\nby the FBI, there might conceivably have been additional investigation\r\nof the Oswald case between November 5 and November 22. Agent Hosty\r\ntestified that several matters brought to his attention in late October\r\nand early November, including the visit to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico\r\nCity, required further attention. Under proper procedures knowledge of\r\nthe pending Presidential visit might have prompted Hosty to have made\r\nmore vigorous efforts to locate Oswald’s roominghouse address in Dallas\r\nand to interview him regarding these unresolved matters.\r\n\r\nThe formal FBI instructions to its agents outlining the information\r\nto be referred to the Secret Service were too narrow at the time\r\nof the assassination. While the Secret Service bears the principal\r\nresponsibility for this failure, the FBI instructions did not\r\nreflect fully the Secret Service’s need for information regarding\r\npotential threats. The handbook referred thus to “the possibility of\r\nan attempt against the person or safety of the President.”[C8-148]\r\nIt is clear from Hosty’s testimony that this was construed, at least\r\nby him, as requiring evidence of a plan or conspiracy to injure the\r\nPresident.[C8-149] Efforts made by the Bureau since the assassination,\r\non the other hand, reflect keen awareness of the necessity of\r\ncommunicating a much wider range of intelligence information to the\r\nService.[C8-150]\r\n\r\nMost important, notwithstanding that both agencies have professed\r\nto the Commission that the liaison between them was close and fully\r\nsufficient,[C8-151] the Commission does not believe that the liaison\r\nbetween the FBI and the Secret Service prior to the assassination was\r\nas effective as it should have been. The FBI Manual of Instructions\r\nprovided:\r\n\r\n    Liaison With Other Government Agencies\r\n\r\n    To insure adequate and effective liaison arrangements, each\r\n    SAC should specifically designate an Agent (or Agents) to be\r\n    responsible for developing and maintaining liaison with other\r\n    Federal Agencies. This liaison should take into consideration\r\n    FBI-agency community of interests, location of agency\r\n    headquarters, and the responsiveness of agency representatives.\r\n    In each instance, liaison contacts should be developed to\r\n    include a close friendly relationship, mutual understanding\r\n    of FBI and agency jurisdictions, and an indicated willingness\r\n    by the agency representative to coordinate activities and to\r\n    discuss problems of mutual interest. Each field office should\r\n    determine those Federal agencies which are represented locally\r\n    and with which liaison should be conducted.[C8-152]\r\n\r\nThe testimony reveals that liaison responsibilities in connection\r\nwith the President’s visit were discussed twice officially by the\r\nspecial agent in charge of the FBI office in Dallas. As discussed in\r\nchapter II, some limited information was made available to the Secret\r\nService.[C8-153] But there was no fully adequate liaison between the\r\ntwo agencies. Indeed, the Commission believes that the liaison between\r\nall Federal agencies responsible for Presidential protection should be\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Protective Measures and Aspects of Secret Service Performance\r\n\r\nThe President’s trip to Dallas called into play many standard operating\r\nprocedures of the Secret Service in addition to its preventive\r\nintelligence operations. Examination of these procedures shows that\r\nin most respects they were well conceived and ably executed by the\r\npersonnel of the Service. Against the background of the critical events\r\nof November 22, however, certain shortcomings and lapses from the high\r\nstandards which the Commission believes should prevail in the field of\r\nPresidential protection are evident.\r\n\r\n_Advance preparations._--The advance preparations in Dallas by Agent\r\nWinston G. Lawson of the White House detail have been described in\r\nchapter II. With the assistance of Agent in Charge Sorrels of the\r\nDallas field office of the Secret Service, Lawson was responsible for\r\nworking out a great many arrangements for the President’s trip. The\r\nService prefers to have two agents perform advance preparations. In\r\nthe case of Dallas, because President Kennedy had scheduled visits to\r\nfive Texas cities and had also scheduled visits to other parts of the\r\ncountry immediately before the Texas trip, there were not enough men\r\navailable to permit two agents to be assigned to all the advance work.\r\nConsequently, Agent Lawson did the advance work alone from November 13\r\nto November 18, when he was joined by Agent David B. Grant, who had\r\njust completed advance work on the President’s trip to Tampa.\r\n\r\nThe Commission concludes that the most significant advance arrangements\r\nfor the President’s trip were soundly planned. In particular, the\r\nCommission believes that the motorcade route selected by Agent Lawson,\r\nupon the advice of Agent in Charge Sorrels and with the concurrence\r\nof the Dallas police, was entirely appropriate, in view of the known\r\ndesires of the President. There were far safer routes via freeways\r\ndirectly to the Trade Mart, but these routes would not have been in\r\naccordance with the White House staff instructions given the Secret\r\nService for a desirable motorcade route.[C8-154] Much of Lawson’s\r\ntime was taken with establishing adequate security over the motorcade\r\nroute and at the two places where the President would stop, Love Field\r\nand the Trade Mart. The Commission concludes that the arrangements\r\nworked out at the Trade Mart by these Secret Service agents with the\r\ncooperation of the Dallas police and other local law enforcement\r\nagents, were carefully executed. Since the President was to be at the\r\nTrade Mart longer than at any other location in Dallas and in view of\r\nthe security hazards presented by the building, the Secret Service\r\ncorrectly gave particular attention in the advance preparations\r\nto those arrangements. The Commission also regards the security\r\narrangements worked out by Lawson and Sorrels at Love Field as entirely\r\nadequate.\r\n\r\nThe Commission believes, however, that the Secret Service has\r\ninadequately defined the responsibilities of its advance agents, who\r\nhave been given broad discretion to determine what matters require\r\nattention in making advance preparations and to decide what action\r\nto take. Agent Lawson was not given written instructions concerning\r\nthe Dallas trip or advice about any peculiar problems which it might\r\ninvolve; all instructions from higher authority were communicated to\r\nhim orally. He did not have a checklist of the tasks he was expected to\r\naccomplish, either by his own efforts or with the cooperation of local\r\nauthorities.[C8-155] The only systematic supervision of the activities\r\nof the advance agent has been that provided by a requirement that he\r\nfile interim and final reports on each advance assignment. The interim\r\nreport must be in the hands of the agent supervising the protective\r\ngroup traveling with the President long enough before his departure to\r\napprise him of any particular problems encountered and the responsive\r\naction taken.[C8-156] Agent Lawson’s interim report was received by\r\nAgent Kellerman on November 20, the day before departure on the Texas\r\ntrip.[C8-157]\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service has advised the Commission that no unusual\r\nprecautions were taken for the Dallas trip, and that “the precautions\r\ntaken for the President’s trip were the usual safeguards employed\r\non trips of this kind in the United States during the previous\r\nyear.”[C8-158] Special Agent in Charge Sorrels testified that the\r\nadvance preparations followed on this occasion were “pretty much the\r\nsame” as those followed in 1936 during a trip to Dallas by President\r\nRoosevelt, which was Sorrels’ first important assignment in connection\r\nwith Presidential work.[C8-159]\r\n\r\nIn view of the constant change in the nature of threats to the\r\nPresident and the diversity of the dangers which may arise in the\r\nvarious cities within the United States, the Commission believes\r\nthat standard procedures in use for many years and applied in all\r\nparts of the country may not be sufficient. There is, for example, no\r\nSecret Service arrangement for evaluating before a trip particular\r\ndifficulties that might be anticipated, which would bring to bear the\r\njudgment and experience of members of the White House detail other than\r\nthe advance agent. Constant reevaluation of procedures, with attention\r\nto special problems and the development of instructions specific to\r\nparticular trips, would be a desirable innovation.\r\n\r\n_Liaison with local law enforcement authorities._--In the description\r\nof the important aspects of the advance preparations, there have\r\nbeen references to the numerous discussions between Secret Service\r\nrepresentatives and the Dallas Police Department. The wholehearted\r\nsupport of these local authorities was indispensable to the Service\r\nin carrying out its duties. The Service had 28 agents participating\r\nin the Dallas visit.[C8-160] Agent Lawson’s advance planning called\r\nfor the deployment of almost 600 members of the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment, Fire Department, County Sheriff’s Department, and the\r\nTexas Department of Public Safety.[C8-161] Despite this dependence on\r\nlocal authorities, which would be substantially the same on a visit\r\nby the President to any large city, the Secret Service did not at the\r\ntime of the assassination have any established procedure governing\r\nits relationships with them.[C8-162] It had no prepared checklist of\r\nmatters to be covered with local police on such visits to metropolitan\r\nareas and no written description of the role the local police were\r\nexpected to perform. Discussions with the Dallas authorities and\r\nrequests made of them were entirely informal.\r\n\r\nThe Commission believes that a more formal statement of assigned\r\nresponsibilities, supplemented in each case to reflect the peculiar\r\nconditions of each Presidential trip, is essential. This would help to\r\neliminate varying interpretations of Secret Service instructions by\r\ndifferent local law enforcement representatives. For example, while the\r\nSecret Service representatives in Dallas asked the police to station\r\nguards at each overpass to keep “unauthorized personnel” off, this term\r\nwas not defined. At some overpasses all persons were excluded, while\r\non the overpass overlooking the assassination scene railroad and yard\r\nterminal workmen were permitted to remain under police supervision,\r\nas discussed in chapter III.[C8-163] Assistant Chief Batchelor of the\r\nDallas police noted the absence of any formal statement by the Secret\r\nService of specific work assigned to the police and suggested the\r\ndesirability of such a statement.[C8-164] Agent Lawson agreed that\r\nsuch a procedure would assist him and other agents in fulfilling their\r\nresponsibilities as advance agents.[C8-165]\r\n\r\n_Check of buildings along route of motorcade._--Agent Lawson did not\r\narrange for a prior inspection of buildings along the motorcade route,\r\neither by police or by custodians of the buildings, since it was not\r\nthe usual practice of the Secret Service to do so.[C8-166] The Chief of\r\nthe Service has provided the Commission a detailed explanation of this\r\npolicy:\r\n\r\n    Except for inauguration or other parades involving foreign\r\n    dignitaries accompanied by the President in Washington, it has\r\n    not been the practice of the Secret Service to make surveys\r\n    or checks of buildings along the route of a Presidential\r\n    motorcade. For the inauguration and certain other parades in\r\n    Washington where the traditional route is known to the public\r\n    long in advance of the event, buildings along the route can be\r\n    checked by teams of law enforcement officers, and armed guards\r\n    are posted along the route as appropriate. But on out-of-town\r\n    trips where the route is decided on and made public only a few\r\n    days in advance, buildings are not checked either by Secret\r\n    Service agents or by any other law enforcement officers at the\r\n    request of the Secret Service. With the number of men available\r\n    to the Secret Service and the time available, surveys of\r\n    hundreds of buildings and thousands of windows is not practical.\r\n\r\n    In Dallas the route selected necessarily involved passing\r\n    through the principal downtown section between tall buildings.\r\n    While certain streets thought to be too narrow could be\r\n    avoided and other choices made, it was not practical to select\r\n    a route where the President could not be seen from roofs or\r\n    windows of buildings. At the two places in Dallas where the\r\n    President would remain for a period of time, Love Field and\r\n    the Trade Mart, arrangements were made for building and roof\r\n    security by posting police officers where appropriate. Similar\r\n    arrangements for a motorcade of ten miles, including many\r\n    blocks of tall commercial buildings is not practical. Nor is it\r\n    practical to prevent people from entering such buildings, or\r\n    to limit access in every building to those employed or having\r\n    business there. Even if it were possible with a vastly larger\r\n    force of security officers to do so, many observers have felt\r\n    that such a procedure would not be consistent with the nature\r\n    and purpose of the motorcade to let the people see their\r\n    President and to welcome him to their city.\r\n\r\n    In accordance with its regular procedures, no survey or other\r\n    check was made by the Secret Service, or by any other law\r\n    enforcement agency at its request, of the Texas School Book\r\n    Depository Building or those employed there prior to the time\r\n    the President was shot.[C8-167]\r\n\r\nThis justification of the Secret Service’s standing policy is not\r\npersuasive. The danger from a concealed sniper on the Dallas trip was\r\nof concern to those who had considered the problem. President Kennedy\r\nhimself had mentioned it that morning,[C8-168] as had Agent Sorrels\r\nwhen he and Agent Lawson were fixing the motorcade route.[C8-169]\r\nAdmittedly, protective measures cannot ordinarily be taken with regard\r\nto all buildings along a motorcade route. Levels of risk can be\r\ndetermined, however, as has been confirmed by building surveys made\r\nsince the assassination for the Department of the Treasury.[C8-170] An\r\nattempt to cover only the most obvious points of possible ambush along\r\nthe route in Dallas might well have included the Texas School Book\r\nDepository Building.\r\n\r\nInstead of such advance precautions, the Secret Service depended in\r\npart on the efforts of local law enforcement personnel stationed along\r\nthe route. In addition, Secret Service agents riding in the motorcade\r\nwere trained to scan buildings as part of their general observation\r\nof the crowd of spectators.[C8-171] These substitute measures were of\r\nlimited value. Agent Lawson was unable to state whether he had actually\r\ninstructed the Dallas police to scan windows of buildings lining the\r\nmotorcade route, although it was his usual practice to do so.[C8-172]\r\nIf such instructions were in fact given, they were not effectively\r\ncarried out. Television films taken of parts of the motorcade by a\r\nDallas television station show the foot patrolmen facing the passing\r\nmotorcade, and not the adjacent crowds and buildings, as the procession\r\npassed.[C8-173]\r\n\r\nThree officers from the Dallas Police Department were assigned to the\r\nintersection of Elm and Houston during the morning of November 22 prior\r\nto the motorcade.[C8-174] All received their instructions early in the\r\nmorning from Capt. P. W. Lawrence of the traffic division.[C8-175]\r\nAccording to Captain Lawrence:\r\n\r\n    I then told the officers that their primary duty was traffic\r\n    and crowd control and that they should be alert for any persons\r\n    who might attempt to throw anything and although it was not a\r\n    violation of the law to carry a placard, that they were not to\r\n    tolerate any actions such as the Stevenson incident and arrest\r\n    any person who might attempt to throw anything or try to get\r\n    at the President and his party; paying particular attention to\r\n    the crowd for any unusual activity. I stressed the fact that\r\n    this was our President and he should be shown every respect\r\n    due his position and that it was our duty to see that this was\r\n    done.[C8-176]\r\n\r\nCaptain Lawrence was not instructed to have his men watch buildings\r\nalong the motorcade route and did not mention the observation of\r\nbuildings to them.[C8-177] The three officers confirm that their\r\nprimary concern was crowd and traffic control, and that they had no\r\nopportunity to scan the windows of the Depository or any other building\r\nin the vicinity of Elm and Houston when the motorcade was passing.\r\nThey had, however, occasionally observed the windows of buildings in\r\nthe area before the motorcade arrived, in accordance with their own\r\nunderstanding of their function.[C8-178]\r\n\r\nAs the motorcade approached Elm Street there were several Secret\r\nService agents in it who shared the responsibility of scanning the\r\nwindows of nearby buildings. Agent Sorrels, riding in the lead car, did\r\nobserve the Texas School Book Depository Building as he passed by, at\r\nleast for a sufficient number of seconds to gain a “general impression”\r\nof the lack of any unusual activity.[C8-179] He was handicapped,\r\nhowever, by the fact that he was riding in a closed car whose roof at\r\ntimes obscured his view.[C8-180] Lawson, also in the lead car, did\r\nnot scan any buildings since an important part of his job was to look\r\nbackward at the Presidents car.[C8-181] Lawson stated that he “was\r\nlooking back a good deal of the time, watching his car, watching the\r\nsides, watching the crowds, giving advice or asking advice from the\r\nChief and also looking ahead to the known hazards like overpasses,\r\nunderpasses, railroads, et cetera.”[C8-182] Agent Roy H. Kellerman,\r\nriding in the front seat of the Presidential car, stated that he\r\nscanned the Depository Building, but not sufficiently to be alerted\r\nby anything in the windows or on the roof.[C8-183] The agents in the\r\nfollowup car also were expected to scan adjacent buildings. However,\r\nthe Commission does not believe that agents stationed in a car behind\r\nthe Presidential car, who must concentrate primarily on the possibility\r\nof threats from crowds along the route, provide a significant safeguard\r\nagainst dangers in nearby buildings.\r\n\r\n_Conduct of Secret Service agents in Fort Worth on November 22._--In\r\nthe early morning hours on November 22, 1963, in Fort Worth, there\r\noccurred a breach of discipline by some members of the Secret Service\r\nwho were officially traveling with the President. After the President\r\nhad retired at his hotel, nine agents who were off duty went to the\r\nnearby Fort Worth Press Club at midnight or slightly thereafter,\r\nexpecting to obtain food; they had had little opportunity to eat during\r\nthe day.[C8-184] No food was available at the Press Club. All of the\r\nagents stayed for a drink of beer, or in several cases, a mixed drink.\r\nAccording to their affidavits, the drinking in no case amounted to\r\nmore than three glasses of beer or 1½ mixed drinks, and others who\r\nwere present say that no agent was inebriated or acted improperly.\r\nThe statements of the agents involved are supported by statements of\r\nmembers of the Fort Worth press who accompanied or observed them and by\r\na Secret Service investigation.[C8-185]\r\n\r\nAccording to their statements, the agents remained at the Press Club\r\nfor periods varying from 30 minutes to an hour and a half, and the last\r\nagent left the Press Club by 2 a.m.[C8-186] Two of the nine agents\r\nreturned to their rooms. The seven others proceeded to an establishment\r\ncalled the Cellar Coffee House, described by some as a beatnik place\r\nand by its manager as “a unique show place with continuous light\r\nentertainment all night [serving] only coffee, fruit juices and no\r\nhard liquors or beer.” [C8-187] There is no indication that any of the\r\nagents who visited the Cellar Coffee House had any intoxicating drink\r\nat that establishment.[C8-188] Most of the agents were there from about\r\n1:30 or 1:45 a.m. to about 2:45 or 3 a.m.; one agent was there from 2\r\nuntil 5 a.m.[C8-189]\r\n\r\nThe lobby of the hotel and the areas adjacent to the quarters of the\r\nPresident were guarded during the night by members of the midnight to 8\r\na.m. shift of the White House detail. These agents were each relieved\r\nfor a half hour break during the night.[C8-190] Three members of this\r\nshift separately took this opportunity to visit the Cellar Coffee\r\nHouse.[C8-191] Only one stayed as long as a half hour, and none had any\r\nbeverage there.[C8-192] Chief Rowley testified that agents on duty in\r\nsuch a situation usually stay within the building during their relief,\r\nbut that their visits to the Cellar were “neither consistent nor\r\ninconsistent” with their duty.[C8-193]\r\n\r\nEach of the agents who visited the Press Club or the Cellar Coffee\r\nHouse (apart from the three members of the midnight shift) had duty\r\nassignments beginning no later than 8 a.m. that morning. President\r\nKennedy was scheduled to speak across the street from his hotel in Fort\r\nWorth at 8:30 a.m.,[C8-194] and then at a breakfast, after which the\r\nentourage would proceed to Dallas. In Dallas, one of the nine agents\r\nwas assigned to assist in security measures at Love Field, and four had\r\nprotective assignments at the Trade Mart. The remaining four had key\r\nresponsibilities as members of the complement of the followup car in\r\nthe motorcade. Three of these agents occupied positions on the running\r\nboards of the car, and the fourth was seated in the car.[C8-195]\r\n\r\nThe supervisor of each of the off-duty agents who visited the Press\r\nClub or the Cellar Coffee House advised, in the course of the Secret\r\nService investigation of these events, that each agent reported\r\nfor duty on time, with full possession of his mental and physical\r\ncapabilities and entirely ready for the performance of his assigned\r\nduties.[C8-196] Chief Rowley testified that, as a result of the\r\ninvestigation he ordered, he was satisfied that each of the agents\r\nperformed his duties in an entirely satisfactory manner, and that their\r\nconduct the night before did not impede their actions on duty or in\r\nthe slightest way prevent them from taking any action that might have\r\naverted the tragedy.[C8-197] However, Chief Rowley did not condone\r\nthe action of the off-duty agents, particularly since it violated a\r\nregulation of the Secret Service, which provides:\r\n\r\n    _Liquor, use of._--a. Employees are strictly enjoined to\r\n    refrain from the use of intoxicating liquor during the hours\r\n    they are officially employed at their post of duty, or when\r\n    they may reasonably expect that they may be called upon to\r\n    perform an official duty. During entire periods of travel\r\n    status, the special agent is officially employed and should not\r\n    use liquor, until the completion of all of his official duties\r\n    for the day, after which time a very moderate use of liquor\r\n    will not be considered a violation. However, all members of the\r\n    White House Detail and special agents cooperating with them on\r\n    Presidential and similar protective assignments are considered\r\n    to be subject to call for official duty at any time while in\r\n    travel status. Therefore, the use of intoxicating liquor of any\r\n    kind, including beer and wine, by members of the White House\r\n    Detail and special agents cooperating with them, or by special\r\n    agents on similar assignments, while they are in a travel\r\n    status, is prohibited.[C8-198]\r\n\r\nThe regulations provide further that “violation or slight disregard” of\r\nthese provisions “will be cause for removal from the Service.”[C8-199]\r\n\r\nChief Rowley testified that under ordinary circumstances he would\r\nhave taken disciplinary action against those agents who had been\r\ndrinking in clear violation of the regulation. However, he felt that\r\nany disciplinary action might have given rise to an inference that\r\nthe violation of the regulation had contributed to the tragic events\r\nof November 22. Since he was convinced that this was not the case, he\r\nbelieved that it would be unfair to the agents and their families to\r\ntake explicit disciplinary measures. He felt that each agent recognized\r\nthe seriousness of the infraction and that there was no danger of a\r\nrepetition.[C8-200]\r\n\r\nThe Commission recognizes that the responsibilities of members of the\r\nWhite House detail of the Secret Service are arduous. They work long,\r\nhard hours, under very great strain, and must travel frequently. It\r\nmight seem harsh to circumscribe their opportunities for relaxation.\r\nYet their role of protecting the President is so important to the\r\nwell-being of the country that it is reasonable to expect them to\r\nmeet very high standards of personal conduct, so that nothing can\r\ninterfere with their bringing to their task the finest qualities and\r\nmaximum resources of mind and body. This is the salutary goal to which\r\nthe Secret Service regulation is directed, when it absolutely forbids\r\ndrinking by any agent accompanying the President on a trip. Nor is\r\nthis goal served when agents remain out until early morning hours,\r\nand lose the opportunity to get a reasonable amount of sleep. It is\r\nconceivable that those men who had little sleep, and who had consumed\r\nalcoholic beverages, even in limited quantities, might have been more\r\nalert in the Dallas motorcade if they had retired promptly in Fort\r\nWorth. However, there is no evidence that these men failed to take\r\nany action in Dallas within their power that would have averted the\r\ntragedy. As will be seen, the instantaneous and heroic response to\r\nthe assassination of some of the agents concerned was in the finest\r\ntradition of Government service.\r\n\r\n_The motorcade in Dallas._--Rigorous security precautions had been\r\narranged at Love Field with the local law enforcement authorities by\r\nAgents Sorrels and Lawson. These precautions included reserving a\r\nceremonial area for the Presidential party, stationing police on the\r\nrooftops of all buildings overlooking the reception area, and detailing\r\npolice in civilian clothes to be scattered throughout the sizable\r\ncrowd.[C8-201] When President and Mrs. Kennedy shook hands with members\r\nof the public along the fences surrounding the reception area, they\r\nwere closely guarded by Secret Service agents who responded to the\r\nunplanned event with dispatch.[C8-202]\r\n\r\nAs described in chapter II, the President directed that his car stop\r\non two occasions during the motorcade so that he could greet members\r\nof the public.[C8-203] At these stops, agents from the Presidential\r\nfollow-up car stood between the President and the public, and on one\r\noccasion Agent Kellerman left the front seat of the President’s car to\r\ntake a similar position. The Commission regards such impromptu stops\r\nas presenting an unnecessary danger, but finds that the Secret Service\r\nagents did all that could have been done to take protective measures.\r\n\r\n_The Presidential limousine._--The limousine used by President Kennedy\r\nin Dallas was a convertible with a detachable, rigid plastic “bubble”\r\ntop which was neither bulletproof nor bullet resistant.[C8-204] The\r\nlast Presidential vehicle with any protection against small-arms\r\nfire left the White House in 1953. It was not then replaced because\r\nthe state of the art did not permit the development of a bulletproof\r\ntop of sufficiently light weight to permit its removal on those\r\noccasions when the President wished to ride in an open car. The\r\nSecret Service believed that it was very doubtful that any President\r\nwould ride regularly in a vehicle with a fixed top, even though\r\ntransparent.[C8-205] Since the assassination, the Secret Service, with\r\nthe assistance of other Federal agencies and of private industry, has\r\ndeveloped a vehicle for the better protection of the President.[C8-206]\r\n\r\n_Access to passenger compartment of Presidential car._--On occasion\r\nthe Secret Service has been permitted to have an agent riding in the\r\npassenger compartment with the President. Presidents have made it\r\nclear, however, that they did not favor this or any other arrangement\r\nwhich interferes with the privacy of the President and his guests.\r\nThe Secret Service has therefore suggested this practice only on\r\nextraordinary occasions.[C8-207] Without attempting to prescribe or\r\nrecommend specific measures which should be employed for the future\r\nprotection of Presidents, the Commission does believe that there are\r\naspects of the protective measures employed in the motorcade at Dallas\r\nwhich deserve special comment.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential vehicle in use in Dallas, described in chapter II, had\r\nno special design or equipment which would have permitted the Secret\r\nService agent riding in the driver’s compartment to move into the\r\npassenger section without hindrance or delay. Had the vehicle been so\r\ndesigned it is possible that an agent riding in the front seat could\r\nhave reached the President in time to protect him from the second and\r\nfatal shot to hit the President. However, such access to the President\r\nwas interfered with both by the metal bar some 15 inches above the back\r\nof the front seat and by the passengers in the jump seats. In contrast,\r\nthe Vice Presidential vehicle, although not specially designed for that\r\npurpose, had no passenger in a jump seat between Agent Youngblood and\r\nVice President Johnson to interfere with Agent Youngblood’s ability\r\nto take a protective position in the passenger compartment before the\r\nthird shot was fired.[C8-208]\r\n\r\nThe assassination suggests that it would have been of prime importance\r\nin the protection of the President if the Presidential car permitted\r\nimmediate access to the President by a Secret Service agent at the\r\nfirst sign of danger. At that time the agents on the running boards of\r\nthe followup car were expected to perform such a function. However,\r\nthese agents could not reach the President’s car when it was traveling\r\nat an appreciable rate of speed. Even if the car is traveling more\r\nslowly, the delay involved in reaching the President may be crucial. It\r\nis clear that at the time of the shots in Dallas, Agent Clinton J. Hill\r\nleaped to the President’s rescue as quickly as humanly possible. Even\r\nso, analysis of the motion picture films taken by amateur photographer\r\nZapruder reveals that Hill first placed his hand on the Presidential\r\ncar at frame 343, 30 frames and therefore approximately 1.6 seconds\r\nafter the President was shot in the head.[C8-209] About 3.7 seconds\r\nafter the President received this wound, Hill had both feet on the car\r\nand was climbing aboard to assist President and Mrs. Kennedy.[C8-210]\r\n\r\n_Planning for motorcade contingencies._--In response to inquiry by\r\nthe Commission regarding the instructions to agents in a motorcade of\r\nemergency procedures to be taken in a contingency such as that which\r\nactually occurred, the Secret Service responded:\r\n\r\n    The Secret Service has consistently followed two general\r\n    principles in emergencies involving the President. All agents\r\n    are so instructed. The first duty of the agents in the\r\n    motorcade is to attempt to cover the President as closely\r\n    as possible and practicable and to shield him by attempting\r\n    to place themselves between the President and any source of\r\n    danger. Secondly, agents are instructed to remove the President\r\n    as quickly as possible from known or impending danger.\r\n    Agents are instructed that it is not their responsibility to\r\n    investigate or evaluate a present danger, but to consider any\r\n    untoward circumstances as serious and to afford the President\r\n    maximum protection at all times. No responsibility rests\r\n    upon those agents near the President for the identification\r\n    or arrest of any assassin or an attacker. Their primary\r\n    responsibility is to stay with and protect the President.\r\n\r\n    Beyond these two principles the Secret Service believes a\r\n    detailed contingency or emergency plan is not feasible because\r\n    the variations possible preclude effective planning. A number\r\n    of steps are taken, however, to permit appropriate steps to\r\n    be taken in an emergency. For instance, the lead car always\r\n    is manned by Secret Service agents familiar with the area and\r\n    with local law enforcement officials; the radio net in use in\r\n    motorcades is elaborate and permits a number of different means\r\n    of communication with various local points. A doctor is in the\r\n    motorcade.[C8-211]\r\n\r\nThis basic approach to the problem of planning for emergencies is\r\nsound. Any effort to prepare detailed contingency plans might well have\r\nthe undesirable effect of inhibiting quick and imaginative responses.\r\nIf the advance preparation is thorough, and the protective devices\r\nand techniques employed are sound, those in command should be able to\r\ndirect the response appropriate to the emergency.\r\n\r\nThe Commission finds that the Secret Service agents in the motorcade\r\nwho were immediately responsible for the President’s safety reacted\r\npromptly at the time the shots were fired. Their actions demonstrate\r\nthat the President and the Nation can expect courage and devotion to\r\nduty from the agents of the Secret Service.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS\r\n\r\nThe Commission’s review of the provisions for Presidential protection\r\nat the time of President Kennedy’s trip to Dallas demonstrates the\r\nneed for substantial improvements. Since the assassination, the Secret\r\nService and the Department of the Treasury have properly taken the\r\ninitiative in reexamining major aspects of Presidential protection.\r\nMany changes have already been made and others are contemplated,\r\nsome of them in response to the Commission’s questions and informal\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssassination a Federal Crime\r\n\r\nThere was no Federal criminal jurisdiction over the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy. Had there been reason to believe that the\r\nassassination was the result of a conspiracy, Federal jurisdiction\r\ncould have been asserted; it has long been a Federal crime to conspire\r\nto injure any Federal officer, on account of, or while he is engaged\r\nin, the lawful discharge of the duties of his office.[C8-212] Murder\r\nof the President has never been covered by Federal law, however, so\r\nthat once it became reasonably clear that the killing was the act of a\r\nsingle person, the State of Texas had exclusive jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIt is anomalous that Congress has legislated in other ways touching\r\nupon the safety of the Chief Executive or other Federal officers,\r\nwithout making an attack on the President a crime. Threatening harm\r\nto the President is a Federal offense,[C8-213] as is advocacy of\r\nthe overthrow of the Government by the assassination of any of its\r\nofficers.[C8-214] The murder of Federal judges, U.S. attorneys and\r\nmarshals, and a number of other specifically designated Federal law\r\nenforcement officers is a Federal crime.[C8-215] Equally anomalous are\r\nstatutory provisions which specifically authorize the Secret Service\r\nto protect the President, without authorizing it to arrest anyone who\r\nharms him. The same provisions authorize the Service to arrest without\r\nwarrant persons committing certain offenses, including counterfeiting\r\nand certain frauds involving Federal checks or securities.[C8-216] The\r\nCommission agrees with the Secret Service[C8-217] that it should be\r\nauthorized to make arrests without warrant for all offenses within its\r\njurisdiction, as are FBI agents and Federal marshals.[C8-218]\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of efforts to make assassination a\r\nFederal crime, particularly after the assassination of President\r\nMcKinley and the attempt on the life of President-elect Franklin D.\r\nRoosevelt.[C8-219] In 1902 bills passed both Houses of Congress but\r\nfailed of enactment when the Senate refused to accept the conference\r\nreport.[C8-220] A number of bills were introduced immediately following\r\nthe assassination of President Kennedy.[C8-221]\r\n\r\nThe Commission recommends to the Congress that it adopt legislation\r\nwhich would:\r\n\r\n    Punish the murder or manslaughter of, attempt or conspiracy to\r\n    murder, kidnaping of and assault upon\r\n\r\n    the President, Vice President, or other officer next in\r\n    the order of succession to the Office of President, the\r\n    President-elect and the Vice-President-elect,\r\n\r\n    whether or not the act is committed while the victim is in\r\n    the performance of his official duties or on account of such\r\n    performance.\r\n\r\nSuch a statute would cover the President and Vice President or,\r\nin the absence of a Vice President, the person next in order of\r\nsuccession. During the period between election and inauguration,\r\nthe President-elect and Vice-President-elect would also be covered.\r\nRestricting the coverage in this way would avoid unnecessary\r\ncontroversy over the inclusion or exclusion of other officials who are\r\nin the order of succession or who hold important governmental posts.\r\nIn addition, the restriction would probably eliminate a need for the\r\nrequirement which has been urged as necessary for the exercise of\r\nFederal power, that the hostile act occur while the victim is engaged\r\nin or because of the performance of official duties.[C8-222] The\r\ngovernmental consequences of assassination of one of the specified\r\nofficials give the United States ample power to act for its own\r\nprotection.[C8-223] The activities of the victim at the time an\r\nassassination occurs and the motive for the assassination bear no\r\nrelationship to the injury to the United States which follows from the\r\nact. This point was ably made in the 1902 debate by Senator George F.\r\nHoar, the sponsor of the Senate bill:\r\n\r\n    * * * what this bill means to punish is the crime of\r\n    interruption of the Government of the United States and the\r\n    destruction of its security by striking down the life of the\r\n    person who is actually in the exercise of the executive power,\r\n    or of such persons as have been constitutionally and lawfully\r\n    provided to succeed thereto in case of a vacancy. It is\r\n    important to this country that the interruption shall not take\r\n    place for an hour * * *[C8-224]\r\n\r\nEnactment of this statute would mean that the investigation of any of\r\nthe acts covered and of the possibility of a further attempt would be\r\nconducted by Federal law enforcement officials, in particular, the\r\nFBI with the assistance of the Secret Service.[C8-225] At present,\r\nFederal agencies participate only upon the sufferance of the local\r\nauthorities. While the police work of the Dallas authorities in the\r\nearly identification and apprehension of Oswald was both efficient\r\nand prompt, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who strongly supports such\r\nlegislation, testified that the absence of clear Federal jurisdiction\r\nover the assassination of President Kennedy led to embarrassment\r\nand confusion in the subsequent investigation by Federal and local\r\nauthorities.[C8-226] In addition, the proposed legislation will insure\r\nthat any suspects who are arrested will be Federal prisoners, subject\r\nto Federal protection from vigilante justice and other threats.[C8-227]\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee of Cabinet Officers\r\n\r\nAs our Government has become more complex, agencies other than the\r\nSecret Service have become involved in phases of the overall problem\r\nof protecting our national leaders. The FBI is the major domestic\r\ninvestigating agency of the United States, while the CIA has the\r\nprimary responsibility for collecting intelligence overseas to\r\nsupplement information acquired by the Department of State. The Secret\r\nService must rely in large part upon the investigating capacity and\r\nexperience of these and other agencies for much of its information\r\nregarding possible dangers to the President. The Commission believes\r\nthat it is necessary to improve the cooperation among these agencies\r\nand to emphasize that the task of Presidential protection is one of\r\nbroad national concern.\r\n\r\nThe Commission suggests that consideration might be given to assigning\r\nto a Cabinet-level committee or the National Security Council (which\r\nis responsible for advising the President respecting the coordination\r\nof departmental policies relating to the national security)[C8-228]\r\nthe responsibility to review and oversee the protective activities\r\nof the Secret Service and the other Federal agencies that assist in\r\nsafeguarding the President. The Committee should include the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury and the Attorney General, and, if the Council is used,\r\narrangements should be made for the attendance of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury and the Attorney General at any meetings which are concerned\r\nwith Presidential protection.[C8-229] The Council already includes, in\r\naddition to the President and Vice President, the Secretaries of State\r\nand Defense and has a competent staff.\r\n\r\nThe foremost assignment of the Committee would be to insure that the\r\nmaximum resources of the Federal Government are fully engaged in the\r\njob of protecting the President, by defining responsibilities clearly\r\nand overseeing their execution. Major needs of personnel or other\r\nresources might be met more easily on its recommendation than they have\r\nbeen in the past.\r\n\r\nThe Committee would be able to provide guidance in defining the general\r\nnature of domestic and foreign dangers to Presidential security. As\r\nimprovements are recommended for the advance detection of potential\r\nthreats to the President, it could act as a final review board. The\r\nexpert assistance and resources which it could draw upon would be\r\nparticularly desirable in this complex and sensitive area.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement would provide a continuing high-level contact for\r\nagencies that may wish to consult respecting particular protective\r\nmeasures. For various reasons the Secret Service has functioned largely\r\nas an informal part of the White House staff, with the result that\r\nit has been unable, as a practical matter, to exercise sufficient\r\ninfluence over the security precautions which surround Presidential\r\nactivities. A Cabinet-level committee which is actively concerned with\r\nthese problems would be able to discuss these matters more effectively\r\nwith the President.\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsibilities for Presidential Protection\r\n\r\nThe assignment of the responsibility of protecting the President to\r\nan agency of the Department of the Treasury was largely an historical\r\naccident.[C8-230] The Secret Service was organized as a division of the\r\nDepartment of the Treasury in 1865, to deal with counterfeiting. In\r\n1894, while investigating a plot to assassinate President Cleveland,\r\nthe Service assigned a small protective detail of agents to the White\r\nHouse. Secret Service men accompanied the President and his family to\r\ntheir vacation home in Massachusetts and special details protected him\r\nin Washington, on trips, and at special functions. These informal and\r\npart-time arrangements led to more systematic protection in 1902, after\r\nthe assassination of President McKinley; the Secret Service, then the\r\nonly Federal investigative agency, assumed full-time responsibility\r\nfor the safety of the President. Since that time, the Secret Service\r\nhas had and exercised responsibility for the physical protection of\r\nthe President and also for the preventive investigation of potential\r\nthreats against the President.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Secret Service has had the primary responsibility for\r\nthe protection of the President, the FBI, which was established\r\nwithin the Department of Justice in 1908, has had in recent years an\r\nincreasingly important role to play. In the appropriations of the\r\nFBI there has recurred annually an item for the “protection of the\r\nperson of the President of the United States,” which first appeared\r\nin the appropriation of the Department of Justice in 1910 under the\r\nheading “Miscellaneous Objects.”[C8-231] Although the FBI is not\r\ncharged with the physical protection of the President, it does have an\r\nassignment, as do other Government agencies, in the field of preventive\r\ninvestigation in regard to the President’s security. As discussed\r\nabove, the Bureau has attempted to meet its responsibilities in this\r\nfield by spelling out in its Handbook the procedures which its agents\r\nare to follow in connection with information received “indicating\r\nthe possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the\r\nPresident” or other protected persons.\r\n\r\nWith two Federal agencies operating in the same general field of\r\npreventive investigation, questions inevitably arise as to the scope\r\nof each agency’s authority and responsibility. As the testimony of\r\nJ. Edgar Hoover and other Bureau officials revealed, the FBI did not\r\nbelieve that its directive required the Bureau to notify the Secret\r\nService of the substantial information about Lee Harvey Oswald which\r\nthe FBI had accumulated before the President reached Dallas. On the\r\nother hand, the Secret Service had no knowledge whatever of Oswald,\r\nhis background, or his employment at the Book Depository, and Robert\r\nI. Bouck, who was in charge of the Protective Research Section of the\r\nSecret Service, believed that the accumulation of the facts known to\r\nthe FBI should have constituted a sufficient basis to warn the Secret\r\nService of the Oswald risk.\r\n\r\nThe Commission believes that both the FBI and the Secret Service\r\nhave too narrowly construed their respective responsibilities. The\r\nCommission has the impression that too much emphasis is placed by\r\nboth on the investigation of specific threats by individuals and not\r\nenough on dangers from other sources. In addition, the Commission has\r\nconcluded that the Secret Service particularly tends to be the passive\r\nrecipient of information regarding such threats and that its Protective\r\nResearch Section is not adequately staffed or equipped to conduct the\r\nwider investigative work that is required today for the security of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nDuring the period the Commission was giving thought to this situation,\r\nthe Commission received a number of proposals designed to improve\r\ncurrent arrangements for protecting the President. These proposals\r\nincluded suggestions to locate exclusive responsibility for all phases\r\nof the work in one or another Government agency, to clarify the\r\ndivision of authority between the agencies involved, and to retain the\r\nexisting system but expand both the scope and the operations of the\r\nexisting agencies, particularly those of the Secret Service and the FBI.\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out that the FBI, as our chief investigative\r\nagency, is properly manned and equipped to carry on extensive\r\ninformation gathering functions within the United States. It was also\r\nsuggested that it would take a substantial period of time for the\r\nSecret Service to build up the experience and skills necessary to meet\r\nthe problem. Consequently the suggestion has been made, on the one\r\nhand, that all preventive investigative functions relating to the\r\nsecurity of the President should be transferred to the FBI, leaving\r\nwith the Secret Service only the responsibility for the physical\r\nprotection of the President, that is, the guarding function alone.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is urged that all features of the protection\r\nof the President and his family should be committed to an elite and\r\nindependent corps. It is also contended that the agents should be\r\nintimately associated with the life of the Presidential family in\r\nall its ramifications and alert to every danger that might befall\r\nit, and ready at any instant to hazard great danger to themselves in\r\nthe performance of their tremendous responsibility. It is suggested\r\nthat an organization shorn of its power to investigate all the\r\npossibilities of danger to the President and becoming merely the\r\nrecipient of information gathered by others would become limited solely\r\nto acts of physical alertness and personal courage incident to its\r\nresponsibilities. So circumscribed, it could not maintain the esprit\r\nde corps or the necessary alertness for this unique and challenging\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nWhile in accordance with its mandate this Commission has necessarily\r\nexamined into the functioning of the various Federal agencies concerned\r\nwith the tragic trip of President Kennedy to Dallas and while it\r\nhas arrived at certain conclusions in respect thereto, it seems\r\nclear that it was not within the Commission’s responsibility to make\r\nspecific recommendations as to the long-range organization of the\r\nPresident’s protection, except as conclusions flowing directly from\r\nits examination of the President’s assassination can be drawn. The\r\nCommission was not asked to apply itself as did the Hoover Commission\r\nin 1949, for example, to a determination of the optimum organization\r\nof the President’s protection. It would have been necessary for the\r\nCommission to take considerable testimony, much of it extraneous to\r\nthe facts of the assassination of President Kennedy, to put it in a\r\nposition to reach final conclusions in this respect. There are always\r\ndangers of divided responsibility, duplication, and confusion of\r\nauthority where more than one agency is operating in the same field;\r\nbut on the other hand the protection of the President is in a real\r\nsense a Government-wide responsibility which must necessarily be\r\nassumed by the Department of State, the FBI, the CIA, and the military\r\nintelligence agencies as well as the Secret Service. Moreover, a number\r\nof imponderable questions have to be weighed if any change in the\r\nintimate association now established between the Secret Service and the\r\nPresident and his family is contemplated.\r\n\r\nThese considerations have induced the Commission to believe that\r\nthe determination of whether or not there should be a relocation of\r\nresponsibilities and functions should be left to the Executive and the\r\nCongress, perhaps upon recommendations based on further studies by the\r\nCabinet-level committee recommended above or the National Security\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nPending any such determination, however, this Commission is convinced\r\nof the necessity of better coordination and direction of the\r\nactivities of all existing agencies of Government which are in a\r\nposition to, and do, furnish information and services related to the\r\nsecurity of the President. The Commission feels the Secret Service and\r\nthe FBI, as well as the State Department and the CIA when the President\r\ntravels abroad, could improve their existing capacities and procedures\r\nso as to lessen the chances of assassination. Without, therefore,\r\ncoming to final conclusions respecting the long-range organization\r\nof the President’s security, the Commission believes that the facts\r\nof the assassination of President Kennedy point to certain measures\r\nwhich, while assuming no radical relocation of responsibilities, can\r\nand should be recommended by this Commission in the interest of the\r\nmore efficient protection of the President. These recommendations are\r\nreviewed below.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Supervision of the Secret Service\r\n\r\nThe intimacy of the Secret Service’s relationship to the White House\r\nand the dissimilarity of its protective functions to most activities of\r\nthe Department of the Treasury have made it difficult for the Treasury\r\nto maintain close and continuing supervision. The Commission believes\r\nthat the recommended Cabinet-level committee will help to correct many\r\nof the major deficiencies of supervision disclosed by the Commission’s\r\ninvestigation. Other measures should be taken as well to improve the\r\noverall operation of the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nDaily supervision of the operations of the Secret Service within the\r\nDepartment of the Treasury should be improved. The Chief of the Service\r\nnow reports to the Secretary of the Treasury through an Assistant\r\nSecretary whose duties also include the direct supervision of the\r\nBureau of the Mint and the Department’s Employment Policy Program, and\r\nwho also represents the Secretary of the Treasury on various committees\r\nand groups.[C8-232] The incumbent has no technical qualifications in\r\nthe area of Presidential protection.[C8-233] The Commission recommends\r\nthat the Secretary of the Treasury appoint a special assistant\r\nwith the responsibility of supervising the Service. This special\r\nassistant should be required to have sufficient stature and experience\r\nin law enforcement, intelligence, or allied fields to be able to\r\nprovide effective continuing supervision, and to keep the Secretary\r\nfully informed regarding all significant developments relating to\r\nPresidential protection.\r\n\r\nThis report has already pointed out several respects in which the\r\nCommission believes that the Secret Service has operated with\r\ninsufficient planning or control. Actions by the Service since the\r\nassassination indicate its awareness of the necessity for substantial\r\nimprovement in its administration. A formal and thorough description of\r\nthe responsibilities of the advance agent is now in preparation by the\r\nService.[C8-234] Work is going forward toward the preparation of formal\r\nunderstandings of the respective roles of the Secret Service and other\r\nagencies with which it collaborates or from which it derives assistance\r\nand support. The Commission urges that the Service continue this effort\r\nto overhaul and define its procedures. While manuals and memoranda\r\nare no guarantee of effective operations, no sizable organization\r\ncan achieve efficiency without the careful analysis and demarcation\r\nof responsibility that is reflected in definite and comprehensive\r\noperating procedures.\r\n\r\nThe Commission also recommends that the Secret Service consciously set\r\nabout the task of inculcating and maintaining the highest standard of\r\nexcellence and esprit for all of its personnel. This involves tight and\r\nunswerving discipline as well as the promotion of an outstanding degree\r\nof dedication and loyalty to duty. The Commission emphasizes that it\r\nfinds no causal connection between the assassination and the breach of\r\nregulations which occurred on the night of November 21 at Fort Worth.\r\nNevertheless, such a breach, in which so many agents participated, is\r\nnot consistent with the standards which the responsibilities of the\r\nSecret Service require it to meet.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreventive Intelligence\r\n\r\nIn attempting to identify those individuals who might prove a danger\r\nto the President, the Secret Service has largely been the passive\r\nrecipient of threatening communications to the President and reports\r\nfrom other agencies which independently evaluate their information for\r\npotential sources of danger. This was the consequence of the Service’s\r\nlack of an adequate investigative staff, its inability to process large\r\namounts of data, and its failure to provide specific descriptions of\r\nthe kind of information it sought.[C8-235]\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service has embarked upon a complete overhaul of its\r\nresearch activities.[C8-236] The staff of the Protective Research\r\nSection (PRS) has been augmented, and a Secret Service inspector has\r\nbeen put in charge of this operation. With the assistance of the\r\nPresident’s Office of Science and Technology, and of the Advanced\r\nResearch Projects Agency of the Department of Defense, it has\r\nobtained the services of outside consultants, such as the Rand Corp.,\r\nInternational Business Machines Corp., and a panel of psychiatric\r\nand psychological experts. It has received assistance also from data\r\nprocessing experts at the CIA and from a specialist in psychiatric\r\nprognostication at Walter Reed Hospital.[C8-237] As a result of\r\nthese studies, the planning document submitted by the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury to the Bureau of the Budget on August 31, 1964, makes\r\nseveral significant recommendations in this field.[C8-238] Based\r\non the Commission’s investigation, the following minimum goals for\r\nimprovements are indicated:\r\n\r\n_Broader and more selective criteria._--Since the assassination, both\r\nthe Secret Service and the FBI have recognized that the PRS files can\r\nno longer be limited largely to persons communicating actual threats\r\nto the President. On December 26, 1963, the FBI circulated additional\r\ninstructions to all its agents, specifying criteria for information to\r\nbe furnished to the Secret Service in addition to that covered by the\r\nformer standard, which was the possibility of an attempt against the\r\nperson or safety of the President. The new instructions require FBI\r\nagents to report immediately information concerning:\r\n\r\n    Subversives, ultrarightists, racists and fascists (a)\r\n    possessing emotional instability or irrational behavior, (b)\r\n    who have made threats of bodily harm against officials or\r\n    employees of Federal, state or local government or officials\r\n    of a foreign government, (c) who express or have expressed\r\n    strong or violent anti-U.S. sentiments and who have been\r\n    involved in bombing or bomb-making or whose past conduct\r\n    indicates tendencies toward violence, and (d) whose prior acts\r\n    or statements depict propensity for violence and hatred against\r\n    organized government.[C8-239]\r\n\r\nAlan H. Belmont, Assistant to the Director of the FBI, testified that\r\nthis revision was initiated by the FBI itself.[C8-240] The volume of\r\nreferences to the Secret Service has increased substantially since the\r\nnew instructions went into effect; more than 5,000 names were referred\r\nto the Secret Service in the first 4 months of 1964.[C8-241] According\r\nto Chief Rowley, by mid-June 1964, the Secret Service had received from\r\nthe FBI some 9,000 reports on members of the Communist Party.[C8-242]\r\nThe FBI now transmits information on all defectors,[C8-243] a category\r\nwhich would, of course, have included Oswald.\r\n\r\nBoth Director Hoover and Belmont expressed to the Commission the\r\ngreat concern of the FBI, which is shared by the Secret Service,\r\nthat referrals to the Secret Service under the new criteria might,\r\nif not properly handled, result in some degree of interference with\r\nthe personal liberty of those involved.[C8-244] They emphasized the\r\nnecessity that the information now being furnished be handled with\r\njudgment and care. The Commission shares this concern. The problem is\r\naggravated by the necessity that the Service obtain the assistance of\r\nlocal law enforcement officials in evaluating the information which it\r\nreceives and in taking preventive steps.\r\n\r\nIn June 1964, the Secret Service sent to a number of Federal law\r\nenforcement and intelligence agencies guidelines for an experimental\r\nprogram to develop more detailed criteria.[C8-245] The suggestions of\r\nFederal agencies for revision of these guidelines were solicited. The\r\nnew tentative criteria are useful in making clear that the interest of\r\nthe Secret Service goes beyond information on individuals or groups\r\nthreatening to cause harm or embarrassment to the President.[C8-246]\r\nInformation is requested also concerning individuals or groups who have\r\ndemonstrated an interest in the President or “other high government\r\nofficials in the nature of a complaint coupled with an expressed or\r\nimplied determination to use a means, other than legal or peaceful, to\r\nsatisfy any grievance, real or imagined.”[C8-247] Under these criteria,\r\nwhether the case should be referred to the Secret Service depends on\r\nthe existence of a previous history of mental instability, propensity\r\ntoward violent action, or some similar characteristic, coupled with\r\nsome evaluation of the capability of the individual or group to further\r\nthe intention to satisfy a grievance by unlawful means.[C8-248]\r\n\r\nWhile these tentative criteria are a step in the right direction, they\r\nseem unduly restrictive in continuing to require some manifestation of\r\nanimus against a Government official. It is questionable whether such\r\ncriteria would have resulted in the referral of Oswald to the Secret\r\nService. Chief Rowley believed that they would, because of Oswald’s\r\ndemonstrated hostility toward the Secretary of the Navy in his letter\r\nof January 30, 1962.[C8-249]\r\n\r\n    I shall employ all means to right this gross mistake or\r\n    injustice to a boni-fied U.S. citizen and ex-service man. The\r\n    U.S. government has no charges or complaints against me. I ask\r\n    you to look into this case and take the necessary steps to\r\n    repair the damage done to me and my family.[C8-250]\r\n\r\nEven with the advantage of hindsight, this letter does not appear to\r\nexpress or imply Oswald’s “determination to use a means, other than\r\nlegal or peaceful, to satisfy [his] grievance” within the meaning of\r\nthe new criteria.[C8-251]\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that a good deal of further consideration and\r\nexperimentation will be required before adequate criteria can be\r\nframed. The Commission recognizes that no set of meaningful criteria\r\nwill yield the names of all potential assassins. Charles J. Guiteau,\r\nLeon F. Czolgosz, John Schrank, and Guiseppe Zangara--four assassins\r\nor would-be assassins--were all men who acted alone in their criminal\r\nacts against our leaders.[C8-252] None had a serious record of prior\r\nviolence. Each of them was a failure in his work and in his relations\r\nwith others, a victim of delusions and fancies which led to the\r\nconviction that society and its leaders had combined to thwart him. It\r\nwill require every available resource of our Government to devise a\r\npractical system which has any reasonable possibility of revealing such\r\nmalcontents.\r\n\r\n_Liaison with other agencies regarding intelligence._--The Secret\r\nService’s liaison with the agencies that supply information to it has\r\nbeen too casual. Since the assassination, the Service has recognized\r\nthat these relationships must be far more formal, and each agency\r\ngiven clear understanding of the assistance which the Secret Service\r\nexpects.[C8-253]\r\n\r\nOnce the Secret Service has formulated its new standards for collection\r\nof information, it should enter into written agreements with each\r\nFederal agency and the leading State and local agencies that might\r\nbe a source of such information. Such agreements should describe in\r\ndetail the information which is sought, the manner in which it will be\r\nprovided to the Secret Service, and the respective responsibilities for\r\nany further investigation that may be required.\r\n\r\nThis is especially necessary with regard to the FBI and CIA, which\r\ncarry the major responsibility for supplying information about\r\npotential threats, particularly those arising from organized groups,\r\nwithin their special jurisdiction. Since these agencies are already\r\nobliged constantly to evaluate the activities of such groups, they\r\nshould be responsible for advising the Secret Service if information\r\ndevelops indicating the existence of an assassination plot and for\r\nreporting such events as a change in leadership or dogma which indicate\r\nthat the group may present a danger to the President. Detailed formal\r\nagreements embodying these arrangements should be worked out between\r\nthe Secret Service and both of these agencies.\r\n\r\nIt should be made clear that the Secret Service will in no way seek\r\nto duplicate the intelligence and investigative capabilities of the\r\nagencies now operating in this field but will continue to use the\r\ndata developed by these agencies to carry out its special duties.\r\nOnce experience has been gained in implementing such agreements with\r\nthe Federal and leading State and local agencies, the Secret Service,\r\nthrough its field offices, should negotiate similar arrangements with\r\nsuch other State and local law enforcement agencies as may provide\r\nmeaningful assistance. Much useful information will come to the\r\nattention of local law enforcement agencies in the regular course of\r\ntheir activities, and this source should not be neglected by undue\r\nconcentration on relationships with other Federal agencies. Finally,\r\nthese agreements with Federal and local authorities will be of little\r\nvalue unless a system is established for the frequent formal review of\r\nactivities thereunder.\r\n\r\nIn this regard the Commission notes with approval several recent\r\nmeasures taken and proposed by the Secret Service to improve its\r\nliaison arrangements. In his testimony Secretary of the Treasury C.\r\nDouglas Dillon informed the Commission that an interagency committee\r\nhas been established to develop more effective criteria. According to\r\nSecretary Dillon, the Committee will include representatives of the\r\nPresident’s Office of Science and Technology, Department of Defense,\r\nCIA, FBI, and the Secret Service.[C8-254] In addition, the Department\r\nof the Treasury has requested five additional agents for its Protective\r\nResearch Section to serve as liaison officers with law enforcement and\r\nintelligence agencies.[C8-255] On the basis of the Department’s review\r\nduring the past several months, Secretary Dillon testified that the\r\nuse of such liaison officers is the only effective way to insure that\r\nadequate liaison is maintained.[C8-256] As a beginning step to improve\r\nliaison with local law enforcement officials, the Secret Service on\r\nAugust 26, 1964, directed its field representatives to send a form\r\nrequest for intelligence information to all local, county, and State\r\nlaw enforcement agencies in their districts.[C8-257] Each of these\r\nefforts appears sound, and the Commission recommends that these and the\r\nother measures suggested by the Commission be pursued vigorously by the\r\nSecret Service.\r\n\r\n_Automatic data processing._--Unless the Secret Service is able to\r\ndeal rapidly and accurately with a growing body of data, the increased\r\ninformation supplied by other agencies will be wasted. PRS must develop\r\nthe capacity to classify its subjects on a more sophisticated basis\r\nthan the present geographic breakdown. Its present manual filing system\r\nis obsolete; it makes no use of the recent developments in automatic\r\ndata processing which are widely used in the business world and in\r\nother Government offices.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury now recognize\r\nthis critical need. In the planning document currently under review\r\nby the Bureau of the Budget, the Department recommends that it be\r\npermitted to hire five qualified persons “to plan and develop a\r\nworkable and efficient automated file and retrieval system.”[C8-258]\r\nAlso the Department requests the sum of $100,000 to conduct a detailed\r\nfeasibility study; this money would be used to compensate consultants,\r\nto lease standard equipment or to purchase specially designed pilot\r\nequipment.[C8-259] On the basis of such a feasibility study, the\r\nDepartment hopes to design a practical system which will fully meet the\r\nneeds of the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nThe Commission recommends that prompt and favorable consideration be\r\ngiven to this request. The Commission further recommends that the\r\nSecret Service coordinate its planning as closely as possible with all\r\nof the Federal agencies from which it receives information. The Secret\r\nService should not and does not plan to develop its own intelligence\r\ngathering facilities to duplicate the existing facilities of other\r\nFederal agencies. In planning its data processing techniques, the\r\nSecret Service should attempt to develop a system compatible with those\r\nof the agencies from which most of its data will come.[E]\r\n\r\n    [E] In evaluating data processing techniques of the Secret\r\n        Service, the Commission had occasion to become informed, to\r\n        a limited extent, about the data processing techniques of\r\n        other Federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\r\n        The Commission was struck by the apparent lack of effort,\r\n        on an interagency basis, to develop coordinated and\r\n        mutually compatible systems, even where such coordination\r\n        would not seem inconsistent with the particular purposes of\r\n        the agency involved. The Commission recognizes that this is\r\n        a controversial area and that many strongly held views are\r\n        advanced in resistance to any suggestion that an effort be\r\n        made to impose any degree of coordination. This matter is\r\n        obviously beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission, but it\r\n        seems to warrant further study before each agency becomes\r\n        irrevocably committed to separate action. The Commission,\r\n        therefore, recommends that the President consider ordering\r\n        an inquiry into the possibility that coordination might\r\n        be achieved to a greater extent than seems now to be\r\n        contemplated, without interference with the primary mission\r\n        of each agency involved.\r\n\r\n_Protective Research participation in advance arrangements._--Since\r\nthe assassination, Secret Service procedures have been changed to\r\nrequire that a member of PRS accompany each advance survey team to\r\nestablish liaison with local intelligence gathering agencies and to\r\nprovide for the immediate evaluation of information received from\r\nthem.[C8-260] This PRS agent will also be responsible for establishing\r\nan informal local liaison committee to make certain that all protective\r\nintelligence activities are coordinated. Based on its experience\r\nduring this period, the Secret Service now recommends that additional\r\npersonnel be made available to PRS so that these arrangements can\r\nbe made permanent without adversely affecting the operations of the\r\nService’s field offices.[C8-261] The Commission regards this as a most\r\nuseful innovation and urges that the practice be continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiaison With Local Law Enforcement Agencies\r\n\r\nAdvice by the Secret Service to local police in metropolitan areas\r\nrelating to the assistance expected in connection with a Presidential\r\nvisit has hitherto been handled on an informal basis.[C8-262]\r\nThe Service should consider preparing formal explanations of the\r\ncooperation anticipated during a Presidential visit to a city, in\r\nformats that can be communicated to each level of local authorities.\r\nThus, the local chief of police could be given a master plan, prepared\r\nfor the occasion, of all protective measures to be taken during the\r\nvisit; each patrolman might be given a prepared booklet of instructions\r\nexplaining what is expected of him.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service has expressed concern that written instructions\r\nmight come into the hands of local newspapers, to the prejudice of\r\nthe precautions described.[C8-263] However, the instructions must be\r\ncommunicated to the local police in any event and can be leaked to\r\nthe press whether or not they are in writing. More importantly, the\r\nlack of carefully prepared and carefully transmitted instructions\r\nfor typical visits to cities can lead to lapses in protection, such\r\nas the confusion in Dallas about whether members of the public were\r\npermitted on overpasses.[C8-264] Such instructions will not fit\r\nall circumstances, of course, and should not be relied upon to the\r\ndetriment of the imaginative application of judgment in special cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nInspection of Buildings\r\n\r\nSince the assassination of President Kennedy, the Secret Service has\r\nbeen experimenting with new techniques in the inspection of buildings\r\nalong a motorcade route.[C8-265] According to Secretary Dillon, the\r\nstudies indicate that there is some utility in attempting to designate\r\ncertain buildings as involving a higher risk than others.[C8-266] The\r\nCommission strongly encourages these efforts to improve protection\r\nalong a motorcade route. The Secret Service should utilize the\r\npersonnel of other Federal law enforcement offices in the locality to\r\nassure adequate manpower for this task, as it is now doing.[C8-267]\r\nLack of adequate resources is an unacceptable excuse for failing to\r\nimprove advance precautions in this crucial area of Presidential\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecret Service Personnel and Facilities\r\n\r\nTestimony and other evidence before the Commission suggest that the\r\nSecret Service is trying to accomplish its job with too few people\r\nand without adequate modern equipment. Although Chief Rowley does not\r\ncomplain about the pay scale for Secret Service agents, salaries are\r\nbelow those of the FBI and leading municipal police forces.[C8-268] The\r\nassistant to the Director of the FBI testified that the caseload of\r\neach FBI agent averaged 20-25, and he felt that this was high.[C8-269]\r\nChief Rowley testified that the present workload of each Secret Service\r\nagent averages 110.1 cases.[C8-270] While these statistics relate to\r\nthe activities of Secret Service agents stationed in field offices\r\nand not the White House detail, field agents supplement those on the\r\ndetail, particularly when the President is traveling. Although the\r\nCommission does not know whether the cases involved are entirely\r\ncomparable, these figures suggest that the agents of the Secret Service\r\nare substantially overworked.\r\n\r\nIn its budget request for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1964,\r\nthe Secret Service sought funds for 25 new positions, primarily\r\nin field offices.[C8-271] This increase has been approved by the\r\nCongress.[C8-272] Chief Rowley explained that this would not provide\r\nenough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers\r\nrequired. However, the 1964-65 budget request was submitted in November\r\n1963 and requests for additional personnel were not made because of the\r\nstudies then being conducted.[C8-273]\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service has now presented its recommendations to the Bureau\r\nof the Budget.[C8-274] The plan proposed by the Service would take\r\napproximately 20 months to implement and require expenditures of\r\napproximately $3 million during that period. The plan provides for an\r\nadditional 205 agents for the Secret Service. Seventeen of this number\r\nare proposed for the Protective Research Section; 145 are proposed\r\nfor the field offices to handle the increased volume of security\r\ninvestigations and be available to protect the President or Vice\r\nPresident when they travel; 18 agents are proposed for a rotating pool\r\nwhich will go through an intensive training cycle and also be available\r\nto supplement the White House detail in case of unexpected need; and 25\r\nadditional agents are recommended to provide the Vice President full\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe Commission urges that the Bureau of the Budget review these\r\nrecommendations with the Secret Service and authorize a request for the\r\nnecessary supplemental appropriation, as soon as it can be justified.\r\nThe Congress has often stressed that it will support any reasonable\r\nrequest for funds for the protection of the President.[C8-275]\r\n\r\n\r\nManpower and Technical Assistance From Other Agencies\r\n\r\nBefore the assassination the Secret Service infrequently requested\r\nother Federal law enforcement agencies to provide personnel to assist\r\nin its protection functions.[C8-276] Since the assassination, the\r\nService has experimented with the use of agents borrowed for short\r\nperiods from such agencies. It has used other Treasury law enforcement\r\nagents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places\r\nto which the President frequently travels.[C8-277] It has also used\r\nother Federal law enforcement agents during Presidential visits to\r\ncities in which such agents are stationed. Thus, in the 4 months\r\nfollowing the assassination, the FBI, on 16 separate occasions,\r\nsupplied a total of 139 agents to assist in protection work during\r\na Presidential visit,[C8-278] which represents a departure from its\r\nprior practice.[C8-279] From February 11 through June 30, 1964, the\r\nService had the advantage of 9,500 hours of work by other enforcement\r\nagencies.[C8-280]\r\n\r\nThe FBI has indicated that it is willing to continue to make such\r\nassistance available, even though it agrees with the Secret Service\r\nthat it is preferable for the Service to have enough agents to handle\r\nall protective demands.[C8-281] The Commission endorses these efforts\r\nto supplement the Service’s own personnel by obtaining, for short\r\nperiods of time, the assistance of trained Federal law enforcement\r\nofficers. In view of the ever-increasing mobility of American\r\nPresidents, it seems unlikely that the Service could or should increase\r\nits own staff to a size which would permit it to provide adequate\r\nprotective manpower for all situations. The Commission recommends that\r\nthe agencies involved determine how much periodic assistance they can\r\nprovide, and that each such agency and the Secret Service enter into\r\na formal agreement defining such arrangements. It may eventually be\r\ndesirable to codify the practice in an Executive order. The Secret\r\nService will be better able to plan its own long-range personnel\r\nrequirements if it knows with reasonable certainty the amount of\r\nassistance that it can expect from other agencies.\r\n\r\nThe occasional use of personnel from other Federal agencies to assist\r\nin protecting the President has a further advantage. It symbolizes\r\nthe reality that the job of protecting the President has not been\r\nand cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the Secret Service.\r\nThe Secret Service in the past has sometimes guarded its right to\r\nbe acknowledged as the sole protector of the Chief Executive. This\r\nno longer appears to be the case.[C8-282] Protecting the President\r\nis a difficult and complex task which requires full use of the best\r\nresources of many parts of our Government. Recognition that the\r\nresponsibility must be shared increases the likelihood that it will be\r\nmet.\r\n\r\nMuch of the Secret Service work requires the development and use\r\nof highly sophisticated equipment, some of which must be specially\r\ndesigned to fit unique requirements. Even before the assassination,\r\nand to a far greater extent thereafter, the Secret Service has been\r\nreceiving full cooperation in scientific research and technological\r\ndevelopment from many Government agencies including the Department of\r\nDefense and the President’s Office of Science and Technology.[C8-283]\r\n\r\nEven if the manpower and technological resources of the Secret Service\r\nare adequately augmented, it will continue to rely in many respects\r\nupon the greater resources of the Office of Science and Technology and\r\nother agencies. The Commission recommends that the present arrangements\r\nwith the Office of Science and Technology and the other Federal\r\nagencies that have been so helpful to the Secret Service be placed on\r\na permanent and formal basis. The exchange of letters dated August 31,\r\n1964, between Secretary Dillon and Donald F. Hornig, Special Assistant\r\nto the President for Science and Technology, is a useful effort in the\r\nright direction.[C8-284] The Service should negotiate a memorandum of\r\nunderstanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from\r\nwhich it can expect to need help in the future. The essential terms of\r\nsuch memoranda might well be embodied in an Executive order.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThis Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection\r\nof our Presidents which will guarantee security. The demands on the\r\nPresident in the execution of his responsibilities in today’s world are\r\nso varied and complex and the traditions of the office in a democracy\r\nsuch as ours are so deepseated as to preclude absolute security.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has, however, from its examination of the facts of\r\nPresident Kennedy’s assassination made certain recommendations which it\r\nbelieves would, if adopted, materially improve upon the procedures in\r\neffect at the time of President Kennedy’s assassination and result in a\r\nsubstantial lessening of the danger.\r\n\r\nAs has been pointed out, the Commission has not resolved all the\r\nproposals which could be made. The Commission nevertheless is confident\r\nthat, with the active cooperation of the responsible agencies and with\r\nthe understanding of the people of the United States in their demands\r\nupon their President, the recommendations we have here suggested would\r\ngreatly advance the security of the office without any impairment of\r\nour fundamental liberties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\n  IMMEDIATE RELEASE      NOVEMBER 30, 1963\r\n\r\nOffice of the White House Press Secretary\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER\r\n\r\nNO.11130\r\n\r\nAPPOINTING A COMMISSION TO REPORT UPON THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT\r\nJOHN F.

Attempts were also made on the lives of two other\r\nPresidents, one President-elect, and one ex-President. Still other\r\nPresidents were the objects of plots that were never carried out. The\r\nactual attempts occurred as follows:\r\n\r\n  Andrew Jackson             Jan. 30, 1835.\r\n  Abraham Lincoln            Apr. 14, 1865.  Died Apr. 15, 1865.\r\n  James A. Garfield          July 2, 1881.   Died Sept. 19, 1881.\r\n  William McKinley           Sept. 6, 1901.  Died Sept. 14, 1901.\r\n  Theodore Roosevelt         Oct. 14, 1912.  Wounded; recovered.\r\n  Franklin D. Roosevelt      Feb. 15, 1933.\r\n  Harry S. Truman            Nov. 1, 1950.\r\n  John F. Kennedy            Nov. 22, 1963.  Died that day.\r\n\r\nAttempts have thus been made on the lives of one of every five American\r\nPresidents. One of every nine Presidents has been killed. Since 1865,\r\nthere have been attempts on the lives of one of every four Presidents\r\nand the successful assassination of one of every five. During the last\r\nthree decades, three attacks were made.\r\n\r\nIt was only after William McKinley was shot that systematic and\r\ncontinuous protection of the President was instituted. Protection\r\nbefore McKinley was intermittent and spasmodic. The problem had existed\r\nfrom the days of the early Presidents, but no action was taken until\r\nthree tragic events had occurred. In considering the effectiveness of\r\npresent day protection arrangements, it is worthwhile to examine the\r\ndevelopment of Presidential protection over the years, to understand\r\nboth the high degree of continuing danger and the anomalous reluctance\r\nto take the necessary precautions.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Republic, there was remarkably little concern\r\nabout the safety of Presidents and few measures were taken to protect\r\nthem. They were at times the objects of abuse and the recipients of\r\nthreatening letters as more recent Presidents have been, but they\r\ndid not take the threats seriously and moved about freely without\r\nprotective escorts. On his inauguration day, Thomas Jefferson walked\r\nfrom his boarding house to the Capitol, unaccompanied by any guard, to\r\ntake the oath of office. There was no police authority in Washington\r\nitself until 1805 when the mayor appointed a high constable and 40\r\ndeputy constables.[A7-1]\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams received many threatening letters and on one occasion\r\nwas threatened in person in the White House by a court-martialed\r\nArmy sergeant. In spite of this incident, the President asked for no\r\nprotection and continued to indulge his fondness for solitary walks and\r\nearly morning swims in the Potomac.[A7-2]\r\n\r\nAmong pre-Civil War Presidents, Andrew Jackson aroused particularly\r\nstrong feelings. He received many threatening letters which, with a\r\nfine contempt, he would endorse and send to the Washington Globe for\r\npublication. On one occasion in May 1833, Jackson was assaulted by a\r\nformer Navy lieutenant, Robert B. Randolph, but refused to prosecute\r\nhim. This is not regarded as an attempt at assassination, since\r\nRandolph apparently did not intend serious injury.[A7-3]\r\n\r\nLess than 2 years later, on the morning of January 10, 1835, as Jackson\r\nemerged from the east portico of the Capitol, he was accosted by a\r\nwould-be assassin, Richard Lawrence, an English-born house painter.\r\nLawrence fired his two pistols at the President, but they both\r\nmisfired. Lawrence was quickly overpowered and held for trial. A jury\r\nfound him not guilty by reason of insanity. He was confined in jails\r\nand mental hospitals for the rest of his life.[A7-4]\r\n\r\nThe attack on Jackson did not inspire any action to provide protection\r\nfor the Chief Executive. Jackson’s immediate successor, Martin Van\r\nBuren, often walked to church alone and rode horseback alone in\r\nthe woods not far from the White House. In August 1842, after an\r\nintoxicated painter had thrown rocks at President John Tyler, who was\r\nwalking on the grounds to the south of the White House, Congress passed\r\nan act to establish an auxiliary watch for the protection of public and\r\nprivate property in Washington. The force was to consist of a captain\r\nand 15 men. This act was apparently aimed more at the protection of\r\nthe White House, which had been defaced on occasion, than of the\r\nPresident.[A7-5]\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN\r\n\r\nEven before he took the oath of office, Abraham Lincoln was thought\r\nto be the object of plots and conspiracies to kidnap or kill him.\r\nExtremist opponents apparently contemplated desperate measures to\r\nprevent his inauguration, and there is some evidence that they plotted\r\nto attack him while he was passing through Baltimore on his way to\r\nWashington.[A7-6]\r\n\r\nFor the inauguration, the Army took precautions unprecedented up to\r\nthat time and perhaps more elaborate than any precautions taken since.\r\nSoldiers occupied strategic points throughout the city, along the\r\nprocession route, and at the Capitol, while armed men in plain clothes\r\nmingled with the crowds. Lincoln himself, in a carriage with President\r\nBuchanan, was surrounded on all sides by such dense masses of soldiers\r\nthat he was almost completely hidden from the view of the crowds. The\r\nprecautions at the Capitol during the ceremony were almost as thorough\r\nand equally successful.[A7-7]\r\n\r\nLincoln lived in peril during all his years in office. The volume\r\nof threatening letters remained high throughout the war, but little\r\nattention was paid to them. The few letters that were investigated\r\nyielded no results.[A7-8] He was reluctant to surround himself with\r\nguards and often rejected protection or sought to slip away from it.\r\nThis has been characteristic of almost all American Presidents. They\r\nhave regarded protection as a necessary affliction at best and contrary\r\nto their normal instincts for either personal privacy or freedom to\r\nmeet the people. In Lincoln these instincts were especially strong, and\r\nhe suffered with impatience the efforts of his friends, the police, and\r\nthe military to safeguard him.[A7-9]\r\n\r\nThe protection of the President during the war varied greatly,\r\ndepending on Lincoln’s susceptibility to warnings. Frequently, military\r\nunits were assigned to guard the White House and to accompany the\r\nPresident on his travels. Lincoln’s friend, Ward H. Lamon, on becoming\r\nmarshal of the District of Columbia in 1861, took personal charge of\r\nprotecting the President and provided guards for the purpose, but he\r\nbecame so exasperated at the President’s lack of cooperation that he\r\ntendered his resignation. Lincoln did not accept it. Finally, late in\r\nthe war, in November 1864, four Washington policemen were detailed to\r\nthe White House to act as personal bodyguards to the President. Lincoln\r\ntolerated them reluctantly and insisted they remain as inconspicuous as\r\npossible.[A7-10]\r\n\r\nIn the closing days of the war, rumors of attempts on Lincoln’s life\r\npersisted. The well-known actor, John Wilkes Booth, a fanatical\r\nConfederate sympathizer, plotted with others for months to kidnap\r\nthe President. The fall of the Confederacy apparently hardened his\r\ndetermination to kill Lincoln.[A7-11] Booth’s opportunity came on\r\nGood Friday, April 14, 1865, when he learned that the President would\r\nbe attending a play at Ford’s Theater that night. The President’s\r\nbodyguard for the evening was Patrolman John F. Parker of the\r\nWashington Police, a man who proved himself unfit for protective duty.\r\nHe was supposed to remain on guard in the corridor outside of the\r\nPresidential box during the entire performance of the play, but he soon\r\nwandered off to watch the play and then even went outside the theater\r\nto have a drink at a nearby saloon. Parker’s dereliction of duty left\r\nthe President totally unprotected.[A7-12] Shortly after 10 o’clock on\r\nthat evening, Booth found his way up to the Presidential box and shot\r\nthe President in the head. The President’s wound was a mortal one; he\r\ndied the next morning, April 15.[A7-13]\r\n\r\nA detachment of troops captured Booth on April 26 at a farm near\r\nBowling Green, Va.; he received a bullet wound and died a few\r\nhours later. At a trial in June, a military tribunal sentenced\r\nfour of Booth’s associates to death and four others to terms of\r\nimprisonment.[A7-14]\r\n\r\nLincoln’s assassination revealed the total inadequacy of Presidential\r\nprotection. A congressional committee conducted an extensive\r\ninvestigation of the assassination, but with traditional reluctance,\r\ncalled for no action to provide better protection for the President\r\nin the future. Nor did requests for protective measures come from the\r\nPresident or from Government departments. This lack of concern for the\r\nprotection of the President may have derived also from the tendency of\r\nthe time to regard Lincoln’s assassination as part of a unique crisis\r\nthat was not likely to happen to a future Chief Executive.[A7-15]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEED FOR PROTECTION FURTHER DEMONSTRATED\r\n\r\nFor a short time after the war, soldiers assigned by the War Department\r\ncontinued to protect the White House and its grounds. Metropolitan\r\nWashington policemen assisted on special occasions to maintain order\r\nand prevent the congregation of crowds. The permanent Metropolitan\r\nPolice guard was reduced to three and assigned entirely to protection\r\nat the White House. There was no special group of trained officers to\r\nprotect the person of the President. Presidents after Lincoln continued\r\nto move about in Washington virtually unattended, as their predecessors\r\nhad done before the Civil War, and, as before, such protection as they\r\ngot at the White House came from the doormen, who were not especially\r\ntrained for guard duty.[A7-16]\r\n\r\nThis lack of personal protection for the President came again\r\ntragically to the attention of the country with the shooting of\r\nPresident James A. Garfield in 1881. The President’s assassin, Charles\r\nJ. Guiteau, was a self-styled “lawyer, theologian, and politician”\r\nwho had convinced himself that his unsolicited efforts to help elect\r\nGarfield in 1880 entitled him to appointment as a consul in Europe.\r\nBitterly disappointed that the President ignored his repeated written\r\nrequests for appointment to office and obsessed with a kind of\r\nmegalomania, he resolved to kill Garfield.\r\n\r\nAt that time Guiteau was 38 years old and had an unusually checkered\r\ncareer behind him. He had been an itinerant and generally unsuccessful\r\nlecturer and evangelist, a lawyer, and a would-be politician. While\r\nit is true he resented Garfield’s failure to appoint him consul in\r\nParis as a reward for his wholly illusory contribution to the Garfield\r\ncampaign, and he verbally attacked Garfield for his lack of support\r\nfor the so-called Stalwart wing of the Republican Party, these may not\r\nhave supplied the total motivation for his crime. At his trial he\r\ntestified that the “Deity” had commanded him to remove the President.\r\nThere is no evidence that he confided his assassination plans to anyone\r\nor that he had any close friends or confidants. He made his attack on\r\nthe President under circumstances where escape after the shooting was\r\ninconceivable. There were some hereditary mental problems in his family\r\nand Guiteau apparently believed in divine inspiration.[A7-17]\r\n\r\nGuiteau later testified that he had had three opportunities to attack\r\nthe President prior to the actual shooting. On all of these occasions,\r\nwithin a brief period of 3 weeks, the President was unguarded. Guiteau\r\nfinally realized his intent on the morning of July 2, 1881. As Garfield\r\nwas walking to a train in the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station\r\nin Washington, Guiteau stepped up and shot him in the back. Garfield\r\ndid not die from the effects of the wound until September 19, 1881.\r\nAlthough there was evidence of serious abnormality in Guiteau, he was\r\nfound guilty of murder and sentenced to be hanged. The execution took\r\nplace on June 30, 1882.[A7-18]\r\n\r\nAt least one newspaper, the New York Tribune, predicted that the\r\nassault on Garfield would lead to the President becoming “the slave\r\nof his office, the prisoner of forms and restrictions,” in sharp and\r\nunwelcome contrast to the splendidly simple life he had been able to\r\nlive before.\r\n\r\n    The bullet of the assassin who lurked in the Washington railway\r\n    station to take the life of President Garfield shattered the\r\n    simple Republican manner of life which the custom of nearly\r\n    a century has prescribed for the Chief Magistrate of the\r\n    United States. Our Presidents have been the first citizens of\r\n    the Republic--nothing more. With a measure of power in their\r\n    hands far greater than is wielded by the ruler of any limited\r\n    monarchy in Europe, they have never surrounded themselves with\r\n    the forms and safeguards of courts. The White House has been a\r\n    business office to everybody. Its occupant has always been more\r\n    accessible than the heads of great commercial establishments.\r\n    When the passions of the war were at fever heat, Mr. Lincoln\r\n    used to have a small guard of cavalry when he rode out to his\r\n    summer residence at the Soldier’s Home; but at no other time in\r\n    our history has it been thought needful for a President to have\r\n    any special protection against violence when inside or outside\r\n    the White House. Presidents have driven about Washington like\r\n    other people and travelled over the country as unguarded and\r\n    unconstrained as any private citizen.[A7-19]\r\n\r\nThe prediction of the Tribune did not come to pass. Although the\r\nNation was shocked by this deed, its representatives took no steps to\r\nprovide the President with personal protection. The President continued\r\nto move about Washington, sometimes completely alone, and to travel\r\nwithout special protection. There is a story that President Chester A.\r\nArthur, Garfield’s successor, once went to a ceremony at the Washington\r\nNavy Yard on a public conveyance that he hailed in front of the White\r\nHouse.[A7-20]\r\n\r\nDuring Grover Cleveland’s second administration (1893-97) the number of\r\nthreatening letters addressed to the President increased markedly, and\r\nMrs. Cleveland persuaded the President to increase the number of White\r\nHouse policemen to 27 from the 3 who had constituted the force since\r\nthe Civil War. In 1894, the Secret Service began to provide protection,\r\non an informal basis.[A7-21]\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service was organized as a division of the Department of the\r\nTreasury in 1865, to deal with counterfeiting.[A7-22] Its jurisdiction\r\nwas extended to other fiscal crimes against the United States in\r\nlater appropriations acts,[A7-23] but its early work in assisting in\r\nprotecting the President was an unofficial, stopgap response to a\r\nneed for a trained organization, with investigative capabilities, to\r\nperform this task. In 1894, while investigating a plot by a group of\r\ngamblers in Colorado to assassinate President Cleveland, the Secret\r\nService assigned a small detail of operatives to the White House to\r\nhelp protect him. Secret Service men accompanied the President and\r\nhis family to their vacation home in Massachusetts; special details\r\nprotected the President in Washington, on trips, and at special\r\nfunctions.[A7-24] For a time, two agents rode in a buggy behind\r\nPresident Cleveland’s carriage, but this practice attracted so much\r\nattention in the opposition newspapers that it was soon discontinued\r\nat the President’s insistence.[A7-25] These initially informal and\r\npart-time arrangements eventually led to the organization of permanent\r\nsystematic protection for the President and his family.\r\n\r\nDuring the Spanish-American War the Secret Service stationed a detail\r\nat the White House to provide continuous protection for President\r\nMcKinley. The special wartime protective measures were relaxed after\r\nthe war, but Secret Service guards remained on duty at the White House\r\nat least part of the time.[A7-26]\r\n\r\nBetween 1894 and 1900, anarchists murdered the President of France,\r\nthe Premier of Spain, the Empress of Austria, and the King of Italy.\r\nAt the turn of the century the Secret Service thought that the strong\r\npolice action taken against the anarchists in Europe was compelling\r\nthem to flee and that many were coming to the United States. Concerned\r\nabout the protection of the President, the Secret Service increased the\r\nnumber of guards and directed that a guard accompany him on all of his\r\ntrips.[A7-27]\r\n\r\nUnlike Lincoln and Garfield, President McKinley was being guarded when\r\nhe was shot by Leon F. Czolgosz, an American-born 28-year-old factory\r\nworker and farmhand. On September 6, 1901, the President was holding\r\na brief reception for the public in the Temple of Music at the Pan\r\nAmerican Exposition in Buffalo. Long lines of people passed between\r\ntwo rows of policemen and soldiers to reach the President and shake\r\nhis hand. In the immediate vicinity of the President were four Buffalo\r\ndetectives, four soldiers, and three Secret Service agents. Two of\r\nthe Secret Service men were facing the President at a distance of 3\r\nfeet. One of them stated later that it was normally his custom to\r\nstand at the side of the President on such occasions, but that he had\r\nbeen requested not to do so at this time in order to permit McKinley’s\r\nsecretary and the president of the exposition to stand on either side\r\nof McKinley. Czolgosz joined the line, concealed a pistol under a\r\nhandkerchief, and when he stood in front of the President shot twice\r\nthrough the handkerchief. McKinley fell critically wounded.[A7-28]\r\n\r\nCzolgosz, a self-styled anarchist, did not believe in rulers of any\r\nkind. There is evidence that the organized anarchists in the U.S.A. did\r\nnot accept or trust him. He was not admitted as a member to any of the\r\nsecret anarchist societies. No co-plotters were ever discovered, and\r\nthere is no evidence that he had confided in anyone. A calm inquiry\r\nmade by two eminent alienists about a year after Czolgosz was executed\r\nfound that Czolgosz had for some time been suffering from delusions.\r\nOne was that he was an anarchist; another was that it was his duty to\r\nassassinate the President.[A7-29]\r\n\r\nThe assassin said he had no grudge against the President personally but\r\ndid not believe in the republican form of government or in rulers of\r\nany kind. In his written confession he included the words, “‘I don’t\r\nbelieve one man should have so much service and another man should\r\nhave none.’” As he was strapped to the chair to be electrocuted, he\r\nsaid: “‘I killed the President because he was the enemy of the good\r\npeople--the good working people. I am not sorry for my crime.’”[A7-30]\r\n\r\nMcKinley lingered on for 8 days before he died of blood poisoning\r\nearly on the morning of September 14. Czolgosz, who had been\r\ncaptured immediately, was swiftly tried, convicted, and condemned to\r\ndeath. Although it seemed to some contemporaries that Czolgosz was\r\nincompetent, the defense made no effort to plead insanity. Czolgosz was\r\nexecuted 45 days after the President’s death. Investigations by the\r\nBuffalo police and the Secret Service revealed no accomplices and no\r\nplot of any kind.[A7-31]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF PRESIDENTIAL PROTECTION\r\n\r\nThis third assassination of a President in a little more than a\r\ngeneration--it was only 36 years since Lincoln had been killed--shook\r\nthe nation and aroused it to a greater awareness of the uniqueness of\r\nthe Presidency and the grim hazards that surrounded an incumbent of\r\nthat Office. The first congressional session after the assassination of\r\nMcKinley gave more attention to legislation concerning attacks on the\r\nPresident than had any previous Congress but did not pass any measures\r\nfor the protection of the President.[A7-32] Nevertheless, in 1902 the\r\nSecret Service, which was then the only Federal general investigative\r\nagency of any consequence, assumed full-time responsibility for the\r\nsafety of the President. Protection of the President now became one of\r\nits major permanent functions, and it assigned two men to its original\r\nfull-time White House detail. Additional agents were provided when the\r\nPresident traveled or went on vacation.[A7-33]\r\n\r\nTheodore Roosevelt, who was the first President to experience the\r\nextensive system of protection that has surrounded the President ever\r\nsince, voiced an opinion of Presidential protection that was probably\r\nshared in part by most of his successors. In a letter to Senator Henry\r\nCabot Lodge in 1906, from his summer home, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    The Secret Service men are a very small but very necessary\r\n    thorn in the flesh. Of course, they would not be the least\r\n    use in preventing any assault upon my life. I do not believe\r\n    there is any danger of such an assault, and if there were, as\r\n    Lincoln said, “though it would be safer for a President to live\r\n    in a cage, it would interfere with his business.” But it is\r\n    only the Secret Service men who render life endurable, as you\r\n    would realize if you saw the procession of carriages that pass\r\n    through the place, the procession of people on foot who try to\r\n    get into the place, not to speak of the multitude of cranks and\r\n    others who are stopped in the village.[A7-34]\r\n\r\nRoosevelt, who had succeeded to the Presidency because of an assassin’s\r\nbullet, himself became the object of an assassination attempt a few\r\nyears after he left office and when he was no longer under Secret\r\nService protection. During the Presidential campaign of 1912, just as\r\nhe was about to make a political speech in Milwaukee on October 14, he\r\nwas shot and wounded in the breast by John N. Schrank, a 36-year-old\r\nGerman-born ex-tavern keeper. A folded manuscript of his long speech\r\nand the metal case for his eyeglasses in the breast pocket of\r\nRoosevelt’s coat were all that prevented the assassination.[A7-35]\r\n\r\nSchrank had had a vision in 1901, induced possibly by McKinley’s\r\nassassination, which took on meaning for him after Roosevelt, 11 years\r\nlater, started to campaign for the Presidency. In this vision the ghost\r\nof McKinley appeared to him and told him not to let a murderer (i.e.,\r\nRoosevelt, who according to the vision had murdered McKinley) become\r\nPresident. It was then that he determined upon the assassination. At\r\nthe bidding of McKinley’s ghost, he felt he had no choice but to kill\r\nTheodore Roosevelt. After his attempt on Roosevelt, Schrank was found\r\nto be insane and was committed to mental hospitals in Wisconsin for the\r\nrest of his life.[A7-36]\r\n\r\nThe establishment and extension of the Secret Service authority for\r\nprotection was a prolonged process. Although the Secret Service\r\nundertook to provide full-time protection for the President beginning\r\nin 1902, it received neither funds for the purpose nor sanction\r\nfrom the Congress until 1906 when the Sundry Civil Expenses Act for\r\n1907 included funds for protection of the President by the Secret\r\nService.[A7-37] Following the election of William Howard Taft in 1908,\r\nthe Secret Service began providing protection for the President-elect.\r\nThis practice received statutory authorization in 1913, and in\r\nthe same year, Congress authorized permanent protection of the\r\nPresident.[A7-38] It remained necessary to renew the authority annually\r\nin the Appropriations Acts until 1951.\r\n\r\nAs in the Civil and Spanish-American Wars, the coming of war in 1917\r\ncaused increased concern for the safety of the President. Congress\r\nenacted a law, since referred to as the threat statute, making it a\r\ncrime to threaten the President by mail or in any other manner.[A7-39]\r\nIn 1917 Congress also authorized protection for the President’s\r\nimmediate family by the Secret Service.[A7-40]\r\n\r\nAs the scope of the Presidency expanded during the 20th century,\r\nthe Secret Service found the problems of protection becoming more\r\nnumerous. In 1906, for the first time in history, a President traveled\r\noutside the United States while in office. When Theodore Roosevelt\r\nvisited Panama in that year, he was accompanied and protected by\r\nSecret Service men.[A7-41] In 1918-19 Woodrow Wilson broadened the\r\nprecedent of Presidential foreign travel when he traveled to Europe\r\nwith a Secret Service escort of 10 men to attend the Versailles Peace\r\nConference.[A7-42]\r\n\r\nThe attempt on the life of President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt\r\nin 1933 further demonstrated the broad scope and complexity of the\r\nprotection problems facing the Secret Service. Giuseppe Zangara was\r\na bricklayer and stonemason with a professed hatred of capitalists\r\nand Presidents. He seemed to be obsessed with the desire to kill a\r\nPresident. After his arrest he confessed that he had first planned to\r\ngo to Washington to kill President Herbert Hoover, but as the cold\r\nclimate of the North was bad for his stomach trouble, he was loath\r\nto leave Miami, where he was staying. When he read in the paper that\r\nPresident-elect Roosevelt would be in Miami, he resolved to kill\r\nhim.[A7-43]\r\n\r\nOn the night of February 15, 1933, at a political rally in Miami’s\r\nBayfront Park, the President-elect sat on the top of the rear seat of\r\nhis automobile with a small microphone in his hand as he made a short\r\ninformal talk. Fortunately for him, however, he slid down into the seat\r\njust before Zangara could get near enough to take aim. The assassin’s\r\narm may have been jogged just as he shot; the five rounds he directed\r\nat Roosevelt went awry. However, he mortally wounded Mayor Anton\r\nCermak, of Chicago, and hit four other persons; the President-elect,\r\nby a miracle, escaped. Zangara, of course, never had any chance of\r\nescaping.[A7-44]\r\n\r\nZangara was electrocuted on March 20, 1933, only 33 days after his\r\nattempt on Roosevelt. No evidence of accomplices or conspiracy came to\r\nlight, but there was some sensational newspaper speculation, wholly\r\nundocumented, that Zangara may have been hired by Chicago gangsters to\r\nkill Cermak.[A7-45]\r\n\r\nThe force provided since the Civil War by the Washington Metropolitan\r\nPolice for the protection of the White House had grown to 54 men by\r\n1922.[A7-46] In that year Congress enacted legislation creating the\r\nWhite House Police Force as a separate organization under the direct\r\ncontrol of the President.[A7-47] This force was actually supervised\r\nby the President’s military aide until 1930, when Congress placed\r\nsupervision under the Chief of the Secret Service.[A7-48] Although\r\nCongress transferred control and supervision of the force to the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury in 1962,[A7-49] the Secretary delegated\r\nsupervision to the Chief of the Secret Service.[A7-50]\r\n\r\nThe White House detail of the Secret Service grew in size slowly from\r\nthe original 2 men assigned in 1902. In 1914 it still numbered only 5,\r\nbut during World War I it was increased to 10 men. Additional men were\r\nadded when the President traveled. After the war the size of the detail\r\ngrew until it reached 16 agents and 2 supervisors by 1939. World War II\r\ncreated new and greater protection problems, especially those arising\r\nfrom the President’s trips abroad to the Grand Strategy Conferences in\r\nsuch places as Casablanca, Quebec, Tehran, Cairo, and Yalta. To meet\r\nthe increased demands, the White House detail was increased to 37 men\r\nearly in the war.[A7-51]\r\n\r\nThe volume of mail received by the White House had always been large,\r\nbut it reached huge proportions under Franklin D. Roosevelt. Presidents\r\nhad always received threatening letters but never in such quantities.\r\nTo deal with this growing problem, the Secret Service established in\r\n1940 the Protective Research Section to analyze and make available to\r\nthose charged with protecting the President, information from White\r\nHouse mail and other sources concerning people potentially capable of\r\nviolence to the President. The Protective Research Section undoubtedly\r\npermitted the Secret Service to anticipate and forestall many incidents\r\nthat might have been embarrassing or harmful to the President.[A7-52]\r\n\r\nAlthough there was no advance warning of the attempt on Harry S.\r\nTruman’s life on November 1, 1950, the protective measures taken by the\r\nSecret Service availed, and the assassins never succeeded in firing\r\ndirectly at the President. The assassins--Oscar Collazo and Griselio\r\nTorresola, Puerto Rican Nationalists living in New York--tried to force\r\ntheir way into Blair House, at the time the President’s residence while\r\nthe White House was being repaired. Blair House was guarded by White\r\nHouse policemen and Secret Service agents. In the ensuing gun battle,\r\nTorresola and one White House policeman were killed, and Collazo and\r\ntwo White House policemen were wounded. Had the assassins succeeded in\r\nentering the front door of Blair House, they would probably have been\r\ncut down immediately by another Secret Service agent inside who kept\r\nthe doorway covered with a submachine gun from his vantage point at the\r\nfoot of the main stairs. In all, some 27 shots were fired in less than\r\n3 minutes.[A7-53]\r\n\r\nCollazo was brought to trial in 1951 and sentenced to death, but\r\nPresident Truman commuted the sentence to life imprisonment on July 24,\r\n1952. Although there was a great deal of evidence linking Collazo and\r\nTorresola to the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico and its leader, Pedro\r\nAlbizu Campos, the Government could not establish that the attack on\r\nthe President was part of a larger Nationalist conspiracy.[A7-54]\r\n\r\nThe attack on President Truman led to the enactment in 1951 of\r\nlegislation that permanently authorized the Secret Service to protect\r\nthe President, his immediate family, the President-elect, and the Vice\r\nPresident, the last upon his request. Protection of the Vice President\r\nby the Secret Service had begun in January 1945 when Harry S. Truman\r\noccupied the office.[A7-55]\r\n\r\nIn 1962 Congress further enlarged the list of Government officers\r\nto be safeguarded, authorizing protection of the Vice President (or\r\nthe officer next in order of succession to the Presidency) without\r\nrequiring his request therefor; of the Vice President-elect; and of a\r\nformer President, at his request, for a reasonable period after his\r\ndeparture from office. The Secret Service considered this “reasonable\r\nperiod” to be 6 months.[A7-56]\r\n\r\nAmendments to the threat statute of 1917, passed in 1955 and 1962, made\r\nit a crime to threaten to harm the President-elect, the Vice President,\r\nor other officers next in succession to either office. The President’s\r\nimmediate family was not included in the threat statute.[A7-57]\r\n\r\nCongressional concern regarding the uses to which the President might\r\nput the Secret Service--first under Theodore Roosevelt and subsequently\r\nunder Woodrow Wilson--caused Congress to place tight restrictions on\r\nthe functions of the Service and the uses of its funds.[A7-58] The\r\nrestrictions probably prevented the Secret Service from developing into\r\na general investigative agency, leaving the field open for some other\r\nagency when the need arose. The other agency proved to be the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation (FBI), established within the Department of\r\nJustice in 1908.[A7-59]\r\n\r\nThe FBI grew rapidly in the 1920’s, and especially in the 1930’s\r\nand after, establishing itself as the largest, best equipped, and\r\nbest known of all U.S. Government investigative agencies. In the\r\nappropriations of the FBI there recurred annually an item for the\r\n“protection of the person of the President of the United States,” that\r\nhad first appeared in the appropriation of the Department of Justice\r\nin 1910 under the heading “Miscellaneous Objects.”[A7-60] But there\r\nis no evidence that the Justice Department ever exercised any direct\r\nresponsibility for the protection of the President. Although it had no\r\nprescribed protection functions, according to its Director, J. Edgar\r\nHoover, the FBI did provide protection to Vice President Charles Curtis\r\nat his request, when he was serving under Herbert Hoover from 1929 to\r\n1933. Over the years the FBI contribution to Presidential protection\r\nwas confined chiefly to the referral to the Secret Service of the names\r\nof people who might be potentially dangerous to the President.[A7-61]\r\n\r\nIn recent years the Secret Service has remained a small and specialized\r\nbureau, restricted to very limited functions prescribed by Congress.\r\nIn 1949, a task force of the Commission on Organization of the\r\nExecutive Branch of the Government (Hoover Commission), recommended\r\nnonfiscal functions be removed from the Treasury Department.[A7-62] The\r\nrecommendation called for transfer of the White House detail, White\r\nHouse Police Force, and Treasury Guard Force from the Secret Service\r\nto the Department of Justice. The final report of the Commission\r\non the Treasury Department omitted this recommendation, leaving the\r\nprotective function with the Secret Service.[A7-63] At a meeting of\r\nthe Commission, ex-President Hoover, in a reference to the proposed\r\ntransfer, expressed the opinion that “the President will object to\r\nhaving a ‘private eye’ looking after these fellows and would rather\r\ncontinue with the service.”[A7-64]\r\n\r\nIn 1963 the Secret Service was one of several investigative agencies\r\nin the Treasury Department. Its major functions were to combat\r\ncounterfeiting and to protect the President, his family, and other\r\ndesignated persons.[A7-65] The Chief of the Secret Service administered\r\nits activities through four divisions: Investigation, Inspection,\r\nAdministrative, and Security, and 65 field offices throughout the\r\ncountry, each under a special agent in charge who reported directly\r\nto Washington. The Security Division supervised the White House\r\ndetail, the White House Police, and the Treasury Guard Force. During\r\nfiscal year 1963 (July 1, 1962-June 30, 1963) the Secret Service had\r\nan average strength of 513, of whom 351 were special agents. Average\r\nstrength of the White House Police during the year was 179.[A7-66]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VIII\r\n\r\nMedical Reports From Doctors at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe president arrived in the Emergency Room at exactly 12:43 p.m. in\r\nhis limousine. He was in the back seat, Gov. Conally was in the front\r\nseat of the same car, Gov. Connally was brought out first and was\r\nput in room two. President was brought out next and put in room one.\r\nDr. Clark pronounced the President dead at 1 p.m. exactly. All of\r\nthe President’s belongings except his watch were given to the Secret\r\nService. His watch was given to Mr. C. P. Wright. He left the Emergency\r\nRoom, the President, at about 2 p.m. in an O’Neal ambulance. He was put\r\nin a bronze colored plastic casket after being wrapped in a blanket\r\nand was taken out of the hospital. He was removed from the hospital.\r\nThe Gov. was taken from the Emergency room to the Operating Room.\r\n\r\nThe President’s wife refused to take off her bloody gloves, clothes.\r\nShe did take a towel and wipe her face. She took her wedding ring off\r\nand placed it on one of the President’s fingers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe President arrived at the Emergency Room at 12:43 P.M., the 22nd\r\nof November, 1963. He was in the back seat of his limousine. Governor\r\nConnally of Texas was also in this car. The first physician to see the\r\nPresident was Dr. James Carrico, a Resident in General Surgery.\r\n\r\nDr. Carrico noted the President to have slow, agonal respiratory\r\nefforts. He could hear a heartbeat but found no pulse or blood pressure\r\nto be present. Two external wounds, one in the lower third of the\r\nanterior neck, the other in the occipital region of the skull, were\r\nnoted. Through the head wound, blood and brain were extruding. Dr.\r\nCarrico inserted a cuffed endotracheal tube. While doing so, he noted a\r\nragged wound of the trachea immediately below the larynx.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Dr. Malcolm Perry, Attending Surgeon, Dr. Charles Baxter,\r\nAttending Surgeon, and Dr. Ronald Jones, another Resident in General\r\nSurgery, arrived. Immediately thereafter, Dr. M. T. Jenkins, Director\r\nof the Department of Anesthesia, and Doctors Giesecke and Bunt, two\r\nother Staff Anesthesiologists, arrived. The endotracheal tube had been\r\nconnected to a Bennett respirator to assist the President’s breathing.\r\nAn Anesthesia machine was substituted for this by Dr. Jenkins. Only\r\n100% oxygen was administered.\r\n\r\nA cutdown was performed in the right ankle, and a polyethylene catheter\r\ninserted in the vein. An infusion of lactated Ringer’s solution was\r\nbegun. Blood was drawn for type and crossmatch, but unmatched type “O”\r\nRH negative blood was immediately obtained and begun. Hydrocortisone\r\n300 mgms was added to the intravenous fluids.\r\n\r\nDr. Robert McClelland, Attending Surgeon, arrived to help in the\r\nPresident’s care. Doctors Perry, Baxter, and McClelland began a\r\ntracheostomy, as considerable quantities of blood were present from\r\nthe President’s oral pharynx. At this time, Dr. Paul Peters, Attending\r\nUrological Surgeon, and Dr. Kemp Clark, Director of Neurological\r\nSurgery, arrived. Because of the lacerated trachea, anterior chest\r\ntubes were placed in both pleural spaces. These were connected to\r\nsealed underwater drainage.\r\n\r\nNeurological examination revealed the President’s pupils to be widely\r\ndilated and fixed to light. His eyes were divergent, being deviated\r\noutward; a skew deviation from the horizontal was present. No deep\r\ntendon reflexes or spontaneous movements were found.\r\n\r\nThere was a large wound in the right occipito-parietal region, from\r\nwhich profuse bleeding was occurring. 1500 cc. of blood were estimated\r\non the drapes and floors of the Emergency Operating Room. There\r\nwas considerable loss of scalp and bone tissue. Both cerebral and\r\ncerabellar tissue were extruding from the wound.\r\n\r\nFurther examination was not possible as cardiac arrest occurred at this\r\npoint. Closed chest cardiac massage was begun by Dr. Clark. A pulse\r\npalpable in both the carotid and femoral arteries was obtained. Dr.\r\nPerry relieved on the cardiac massage while a cardiotachioscope was\r\nconnected. Dr. Fouad Bashour, Attending Physician, arrived as this was\r\nbeing connected. There was electrical silence of the President’s heart.\r\n\r\nPresident Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1300 hours by Dr. Clark.\r\n\r\n            Kemp Clark, M.D,\r\n            Director\r\n            Service of Neurological Surgery\r\n\r\nKC:ca\r\n\r\ncc to Dean’s Office, Southwestern Medical School\r\n\r\ncc to Medical Records, Parkland Memorial Hospital\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS\r\n  SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL SCHOOL\r\n\r\n  DALLAS\r\n\r\n  M. T.

Jenkins, M.D., Professor and Chairman\r\n           Department of Anesthesiology\r\n\r\n  Subject: Statement concerning resuscitative efforts for\r\n           President John F. Kennedy\r\n\r\nUpon receiving a stat alarm that this distinguished patient was\r\nbeing brought to the emergency room at Parkland Memorial Hospital, I\r\ndispatched Doctors A. H. Giesecke and Jackie H. Hunt with an anesthesia\r\nmachine and resuscitative equipment to the major surgical emergency\r\nroom area, and I ran down the stairs. On my arrival in the emergency\r\noperating room at approximately 1230 I found that Doctors Carrico\r\nand/or Delaney had begun resuscitative efforts by introducing an\r\norotracheal tube, connecting it for controlled ventilation to a Bennett\r\nintermittent positive pressure breathing apparatus. Doctors Charles\r\nBaxter, Malcolm Perry, and Robert McClelland arrived at the same time\r\nand began a tracheostomy and started the insertion of a right chest\r\ntube, since there was also obvious tracheal and chest damage. Doctors\r\nPaul Peters and Kemp Clark arrived simultaneously and immediately\r\nthereafter assisted respectively with the insertion of the right\r\nchest tube and with manual closed chest cardiac compression to assure\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nFor better control of artificial ventilation, I exchanged the\r\nintermittent positive pressure breathing apparatus for an anesthesia\r\nmachine and continued artificial ventilation. Doctors Gene Akin and\r\nA. H. Giesecke assisted with the respiratory problems incident to\r\nchanging from the orotracheal tube to a tracheostomy tube, and Doctors\r\nHunt and Giesecke connected a cardioscope to determine cardiac activity.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of these activities, the emergency room cart was\r\nelevated at the feet in order to provide a Trendelenburg position,\r\na venous cutdown was performed on the right saphenous vein, and\r\nadditional fluids were begun in a vein in the left forearm while\r\nblood was ordered from the blood bank. All of these activities were\r\ncompleted by approximately 1245, at which time external cardiac massage\r\nwas still being carried out effectively by Doctor Clark as judged\r\nby a palpable peripheral pulse. Despite these measures there was no\r\nelectrocardiographic evidence of cardiac activity.\r\n\r\nThese described resuscitative activities were indicated as of first\r\nimportance, and after they were carried out attention was turned to\r\nall other evidences of injury. There was a great laceration on the\r\nright side of the head (temporal and occipital), causing a great\r\ndefect in the skull plate so that there was herniation and laceration\r\nof great areas of the brain, even to the extent that the cerebellum\r\nhad protruded from the wound. There were also fragmented sections of\r\nbrain on the drapes of the emergency room cart. With the institution of\r\nadequate cardiac compression, there was a great flow of blood from the\r\ncranial cavity, indicating that there was much vascular damage as well\r\nas brain tissue damage.\r\n\r\nIt is my personal feeling that all methods of resuscitation were\r\ninstituted expeditiously and efficiently. However, this cranial and\r\nintracranial damage was of such magnitude as to cause the irreversible\r\ndamage. President Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1300.\r\n\r\n  Sincerely,\r\n\r\n  M. T. Jenkins, M.D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT No. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n\r\nPARKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nOPERATIVE RECORD\r\n\r\nDATE: 11-22-63 Thoracic Surg\r\n\r\nROOM: 220\r\n\r\nSTATUS: Pvt\r\n\r\nNAME: John Connally\r\n\r\nUnit # 26 36 99\r\n\r\nAGE:\r\n\r\nRACE: W/M\r\n\r\nPRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gunshot wound of the chest with comminuted\r\nfracture of the 5th rib\r\n\r\nPOST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same with laceration right middle lobe,\r\nhematoma lower lobe of lung\r\n\r\nOPERATION: Thoractomy, removal rib fragment, debridement of wound\r\n\r\nBEGAN: 1335\r\n\r\nENDED: 1520\r\n\r\nANESTHETIC: General\r\n\r\nBEGAN: 1300\r\n\r\nANESTHESIOLOGIST: Giesecke\r\n\r\nSURGEON: Robert Shaw.

A tube had\r\nbeen placed through the second interspace in the mid-clavicular line\r\nconnected to a waterseal bottle to evacuate the right pneumothorax and\r\nhemathorax. An IV infusion of RL solution had already been started.\r\nAs soon as the patient was positioned on the OR table the anesthesia\r\nwas Induced by Dr. Giesecke and an endotracheal tube was in place. As\r\nsoon as it was possible to control respiration with positive pressure\r\nthe occlusive dressing was taken from the right chest and the extent\r\nof the wound more carefully determined. It was found that the wound of\r\nentrance was just lateral to the right scapula close the the axilla yet\r\nhad passed through the latysmus dorsi muscle shattered approximately\r\nten cm of the lateral and anterior portion of the right fifth rib and\r\nemerged below the right nipple. The wound of entrance was approximately\r\nthree cm in its longest diameter and the wound of exit was a ragged\r\nwound approximately five cm in its greatest diameter. The skin and\r\nsubcutaneous tissue over the path of the missile moved in a paradoxical\r\nmanner with respiration indicating softening of the chest. The skin\r\nof the whole area was carefully cleansed with Phisohex and Iodine.\r\nThe entire area including the wound of entrance and wound of exit was\r\ndraped partially excluding the wound of entrance for the first part\r\nof the operation. An elliptical incision was made around the wound of\r\nexit removing the torn edges of the skin and the damaged subcutaneous\r\ntissue. The incision was then carried in a downward curve up toward the\r\nright axilla so as to not have the skin incision over the actual path\r\nof the missile ban through the chest wall. This incision was carried\r\ndown through the subcutaneous tissue to expose the Serratus anterior\r\nmuscle and the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi muscle. The\r\nfragmented and damaged portions of the Serratus anterior muscle were\r\nexcised. Small rib fragments that were adhering to periosteal tags were\r\ncarefully removed preserving as much periosteum as possible. The fourth\r\nintercostal muscle bundle and fifth intercostal muscle bundle were not\r\nappreciably damaged.\r\n\r\nThe ragged ends of the damaged fifth rib were cleaned out with the\r\nrongeur. The plura had been torn open by the secondary missiles\r\ncreated by the fragmented fifth rib. The wound was open widely and\r\nexposure was obtained with a self retaining retractor. The right\r\nplural cavity was then carefully inspected. Approximately 200 cc of\r\nclot and liquid blood was removed from the pleural cavity. The middle\r\nlobe had a linear rent starting at its peripheral edge going down\r\ntowards itshilum separating the lobe into two segments. There was an\r\nopen bronchus in the depth of this wound. Since the vascularlty and\r\nthe bronchial connections to the lobe were intact it was decided to\r\nrepair the lobe rather then to remove it. The repair was accomplished\r\nwith a running suture of #000 chromic gut on atraumatic needle closing\r\nboth plural surfaces as well as two runnin sutures approximating the\r\ntissue of the central portion of the lobe. This almost completely\r\nsealed off the air leaks which were evident in the torn portion of the\r\nlobe. The lower lobe was next examined and found to be engorged with\r\nblood and at one point a laceration of allowed the oozing of blood.\r\nThis laceration had undoubtedly been caused by a rib fragment. This\r\nlaceration was closed with a single suture of #3-O chromic gut on\r\natraumatic needle. The right pleural cavity was now carefully examined\r\nand small ribs fragments were removed, the diaphram was found to be\r\nuninjured. There was no evidence of injury of the mediastinum and its\r\ncontents. Hemostasis had been accomplished within the plural cavity\r\nwith the repair of the middle lobe and the suturing of the laceration\r\nin the lower lobe. The upper lobe was found to be uninjured. The\r\ndrains which had previously been placed in the second interspace\r\nin the midclavicular line was found to be longer than necessary so\r\napproximately ten cm of it was cut away and the remaining portion was\r\ndemonstrated with two additional openings. An additional drain was\r\nplaced through a stab wound in the eighth interspace in the posterior\r\naxillary line. Both these drains were then connected to a waterseal\r\nbottle. The fourth and fifth intercostal muscles were then approximated\r\nwith interrupted sutures of #O chromic gut. The remaining portion\r\nof the Serratus anterior muscle was then approximated across the\r\nclosure of the intercostal muscle. The laceration of the latissimus\r\ndorsi muscle on its intermost surface was then closed with several\r\ninterrupted sutures of #O chromic gut. ~The subcutaneous tissue was th~\r\nBefore closing the subcutaneous tissue one million units of Penicillin\r\nand one gram of Streptomycin in 100 cc normal saline was instilled\r\ninto the wound. The stab wound was then made in the most dependent\r\nportion of the wound coming out near the angle of the scapula. A large\r\nPenrose drain was drawn out through this stab wound to allow drainage\r\nof the wound of the chest wall. The subcutaneous tissue was then closed\r\nwith interrupted #O chromic gut inverting the knots. Skin closed with\r\ninterrupted vertical mattress sutures of black silk. Attention was next\r\nturned to the wound of entrance. It was excised with an elliptical\r\nincision. It was found that the latissimus dorsi muscle although\r\nlacerated was not badly damaged so that the opening was closed with\r\nsutures of #O chromic gut in the fascia of the muscle. Before closing\r\nthis incision ~the~ palpation with the index finger the Penrose drain\r\ncould be felt immediately below in the space beneath the latissimus\r\ndorsi muscle. The skin closed with interrupted vertical mattress\r\nsutures of black silk. Drainage tubes were secured with safety pens and\r\nadhesive tape and dressings applied. As soon as the operation on the\r\nchest had been concluded Dr. Gregory and Dr. Shires started the surgery\r\nthat was necessary for the wounds of the right wrist and left thigh.\r\n\r\nDr. Robert Shaw\r\n\r\nRS:bl\r\n\r\n* There was also a comminuted fracture of the right radius secondary to\r\nthe same missile and in addition a small flesh wound of the left thigh.\r\nThe operative notes concerning the management of the right arm and left\r\nthigh will be dictated by Dr. Charles Gregory and Dr. Tom Shires.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT No. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT No. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n\r\nPARKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nOPERATIVE RECORD\r\n\r\nDATE: 11-22-63 Ortho\r\n\r\nROOM: 220\r\n\r\nSTATUS: Pvt.\r\n\r\nNAME: Governor John Connally\r\n\r\nUNIT: 26 36 99\r\n\r\nAGE: W/M\r\n\r\nRACE:\r\n\r\nPRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Comminuted fracture of the right distal\r\nradius, open secondary to gunshot wound\r\n\r\nPOST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\r\n\r\nOPERATION: Debridement of gunshot wound of right wrist, reduction of\r\nfracture of the radius\r\n\r\nBEGAN: 1600\r\n\r\nENDED: 1650\r\n\r\nANESTHETIC: General\r\n\r\nBEGAN: 1300\r\n\r\nANESTHESIOLOGIST: Giesecke\r\n\r\nSURGEON: Dr. Charles Gregory\r\n\r\nASSISTANTS: Drs.

Pol Brevis)\r\n\r\nCLINICAL EVALUATION: While still under general anesthesia and following\r\na thoracotomy and repair of the chest injury by Dr. Robert Shaw, the\r\nright upper extremity was thoroughly prepped in the routine fashion\r\nafter shaving. he was draped in the routine fashion using stockinette,\r\nthe only addition was the use of a debridement pan. The wound of entry\r\non the dorsal aspect of the right wrist over the junction of the distal\r\nfourth of the radius and shaft was approximately two cm in length and\r\nrather oblique with the loss of tissue with some considerable contusion\r\nat the margins of it. There was a wound of exit along the volar surface\r\nof the wrist about two cm above the flexion crease of the wrist and in\r\nthe midline. The wound of entrance was carefully excised and developed\r\nthrough the muscles and tendons from the radial side of the bone to\r\nthe bone itself where the fracture was encountered. It was noted that\r\nthe tendon of the abductor palmaris longus was transected, only two\r\nsmall fragments of bone ~was~ were removed, one approximately one cm\r\nin length and consisted of lateral cortex which lay free in the wound\r\nand had no soft tissue connections, another much smaller fragment\r\nperhaps 3 mm in length was subsequently removed. Small bits of metal\r\nwere encountered at various levels throughout the wound and these were\r\nwherever they were identified and could be picked up were picked up and\r\nhave been submitted to the Pathology department for identification and\r\nexamination. Throughout the wound ~it was not~ and especially in the\r\nsuperficial layers and to some extent in the tendon and tendon sheaths\r\non the radial side of the arm small fine bits of cloth consistent with\r\nfine bits of Mohair. It is our understanding that the patient was\r\nwearing a Mohair suit at the time of the injury and this accounts for\r\nthe deposition of such organic material within the wound. After as\r\ncareful and complete a debridement as could be carried out and with\r\nan apparent integrity of the flexor tendons and the median nerve in\r\nthe volar side, and after thorough irrigation the wound of exit on\r\nthe volar surface of the wrist was closed primarily with wire sutures\r\nwhile the wound of entrance on the radial side of the forearm was only\r\npartially closed being left open for the purpose of drainage should any\r\nmake spontaneous appearance.\r\n\r\nThis is because of the presence of Mohair and organic material deep\r\ninto the wound which is prone to produce tissue reactions and to\r\nencourage infection and this precaution of not closing the wound was\r\ntaken in correspondence with our experience in that regard.\r\n\r\nIn view of the urgency of the Governor’s original chest injury it was\r\nimpossible to definitely ascertain the status of the circulation and\r\nthe nerve supply to the hand and wrist on the right side. Accordingly,\r\nit was determined as best we could at the time of operation and the\r\nradial artery was found to be intact and pulsating normally. The\r\nintegrity of the median nerve and the ulnar nerve is not clearly\r\nestablished but it is presumed to be present. Following closure of\r\nthe volar wound and partial closure of the radial wound, dry sterile\r\ndressings were applied and a long arm cast was then applied with skin\r\ntape traction, rubber band variety, attached to the thumb and index\r\nfinger of the right hand. ~The-righ~ An attitude of flexon was created\r\nat the right elbow, and post operatively the limbus suspended from\r\nan overhead frame using tape traction.

The chest injury has been dictated by Dr.\r\nShaw, the orthopedic injury to the arm by Dr. Gregory.\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF PATIENT:\r\n\r\nCLINICAL EVALUATION: There was a 1 cm. punctate missile wound over the\r\njuncture of the middle and lower third, medial aspect, of the left\r\nthigh. X-rays of the thigh and leg revealed a bullet fragment which\r\nwas imbedded in the body of the femur in the distal third. The leg\r\nwas prepared with Phisohex and I.O. Prep and was draped in the usual\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nFollowing this the missile wound was excised and the bullet tract was\r\nexplored. The missile wound was seen to course through the subcutaneous\r\nfat and into the vastus medialis. The necrotic fat and muscle were\r\ndebrided down to the region of the femur. The direction of the missile\r\nwound was judged not to be in the course of the femoral vessel,\r\nsince the wound was distal and anterior to Hunter’s canal. Following\r\ncomplete debridement of the wound and irrigation with saline, the\r\nwound was felt to be adequately debrided enough so that three simple\r\nthrough-and-through, stainless steel Aloe #28 wire sutures were used\r\nencompassing skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle fascia on both\r\nsides. Following this a sterile dressing was applied. The dorsalis\r\npedis and posterior tibial pulses in both lags were quite good. The\r\nthoracic procedure had been completed at this time, the debridement of\r\nthe compound fracture in the arm was still in progress at the time this\r\nsoft tissue injury repair was completed.\r\n\r\n            Tom Shires, M.D.\r\n\r\nfa\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n\r\nPARKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nOPERATIVE RECORD\r\n\r\nDATE: 11/24/63 Surg.\r\n\r\nROOM:\r\n\r\nSTATUS: S NAME: Oswald, Lee Harvey\r\n\r\nEOR UNIT # 25260\r\n\r\nAGE: 24 Yr.\r\n\r\nRACE: W/M\r\n\r\nPRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: GSW of upper abdomen and chest with massive\r\nbleeding\r\n\r\nPOST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Major vascular injury in abdomen and chest\r\n\r\nOPERATION: Exploratory laparotomy, thoracotomy, efforts to repair aorta\r\n           1’15”\r\n\r\nBEGAN: 1142\r\n\r\nENDED: 1307\r\n\r\nANESTHETIC: General\r\n\r\nBEGAN: 1142\r\n\r\nANESTHESIOLOGIST:\r\n    Dr. M.T.

At the time he was seen preoperatively he was without blood\r\npressure, heart beat was heard infrequently at 130 beats per minute,\r\nAnd preoperatively had endotracheal tube placed and was receiving\r\noxygen by anesthesia at the time he was moved to the operating room.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: Under endotracheal oxygen anesthesia,\r\na long mid-line abdominal incision was made. Bleeders were not\r\napparent and none were clamped or tied. Upon opening the peritoneal\r\ncavity, approximately 2 to 3 liters of blood, both liquid and in\r\nclots, were encountered. These were removed. The bullet pathway was\r\nthen identified as having shattered the upper medial surface of the\r\nspleen, then entered the retroperitoneal area where there was a large\r\nretroperitoneal hematoma in the area of the pancreas. Following this,\r\nbleeding was seen to be coming from the right side, and upon inspection\r\nthere was seen to be an exit to the right through the inferior vena\r\ncava, thence through the superior pole of the right kidney, the lower\r\nportion of the right lobe of the liver, and into the right lateral\r\nbody wall. First the right kidney, which was bleeding, was identified,\r\ndissected free, retracted immediately, and the inferior vena cava\r\nhole was clamped with a partial occlusion clamp of the Satinsky type.\r\nFollowing this immobilization, packing controlled the bleeding from\r\nthe right kidney. Attention was then turned to the left, as bleeding\r\nwas massive from the left side. The inspection of the retroperitoneal\r\narea revealed a huge hematoma in the mid-line. The spleen was then\r\nmobilized, as was the left colon, and the retroperitoneal approach was\r\nmade to the mid-line structures. The pancreas was seen to be shattered\r\nin its mid portion, bleeding was seen to be coming from the aorta. This\r\nwas dissected free. Bleeding was controlled with finger pressure by\r\nDr. Malcolm O. Perry. Upon identification of this injury, the superior\r\nmesenteric artery had been sheared off of the aorta, there was back\r\nbleeding from the superior mesenteric artery. This was cross-clamped\r\nwith a small, curved DeBakey clamp. The aorta was then occluded with\r\na straight DeBakey clamp above and a Potts clamp below. At this point\r\nall major bleeding was controlled, blood pressure was reported to be\r\nin the neighborhood of 100 systolic. Shortly thereafter, however, the\r\npulse rate, which had been in the 80 to 90 range, was found to be 40\r\nand a few seconds later found to be zero. No pulse was felt in the\r\naorta at this time. Consequently the left chest was opened through an\r\nintercostal incision in approximately the fourth intercostal space. A\r\nFinochietto retractor was inserted, the heart was seen to be flabby\r\nand not beating at all. There was no hemopericardium. There was a\r\nhole in the diaphragm but no hemothorax. A left closed chest tube had\r\nbeen introduced in the Emergency Room prior to surgery, so that there\r\nwas no significant pneumothorax on the left side. The pericardium was\r\nopened, cardiac massage was started, and a pulse was obtainable with\r\nmassage. The heart was flabby, consequently calcium chloride followed\r\nby epinephrine-Xylocaine® were injected into the left ventricle without\r\nsuccess. However, the standstill was converted to fibrillation.\r\nFollowing this, defibrillation was done, using 240, 360, 500, and 750\r\nvolts and finally successful defibrillation was accomplished. However,\r\nno effective heart beat could be instituted. A pacemaker was then\r\ninserted into the wall of the right ventricle and grounded on skin,\r\nand pacemaking was started. A very feeble, small, localized muscular\r\nresponse was obtained with the pacemaker but still no effective beat.\r\nAt this time we were informed by Dr. Jenkins that there were no signs\r\nof life in that the pupils were fixed and dilated, there was no retinal\r\nblood flow, no respiratory effort, and no effective pulse could be\r\nmaintained even with cardiac massage. The patient was pronounced dead\r\nat 1:07 P.M. Anesthesia consisted entirely of oxygen. No anesthetic\r\nagents as such were administered. The patient was never conscious from\r\nthe time of his arrival in the Emergency Room until his death at 1:07\r\nP.M. The subcutaneous bullet was extracted from the right side during\r\nthe attempts at defibrillation, which were rotated among the surgeons.\r\nThe cardiac massage and defibrillation attempts were carried out by\r\nDr. Robert N. McClelland, Dr. Malcolm O. Perry, Dr. Ronald Jones.\r\nAssistance was obtained from the cardiologist, Dr. Fouad Bashour.\r\n\r\n            Tom Shires, M.D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 392--Continued]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IX\r\n\r\n\r\nAutopsy Report and Supplemental Report\r\n\r\nCLINICAL RECORD AUTOPSY PROTOCOL A63-272 (JJH:ec)\r\n\r\nDATE AND HOUR DIED 22 November 1963 1300 (CST)\r\n\r\nDATE AND HOUR AUTOPSY PERFORMED 22 November 1963 2000 (EST)\r\n\r\nFULL AUTOPSY X\r\n\r\nPROSECTOR (497831) CDR J.J.

A63-272\r\n\r\nPATIENT’S IDENTIFICATION\r\n  KENNEDY, JOHN F.\r\n  NAVAL MEDICAL SCHOOL\r\n\r\nCLINICAL SUMMARY: According to available information the deceased,\r\nPresident John F. Kennedy, was riding in an open car in a motorcade\r\nduring an official visit to Dallas, Texas on 22 November 1963. The\r\nPresident was sitting in the right rear seat with Mrs. Kennedy seated\r\non the same seat to his left. Sitting directly in front of the\r\nPresident was Governor John B. Connolly of Texas and directly in front\r\nof Mrs. Kennedy sat Mrs. Connolly. The vehicle was moving at a slow\r\nrate of speed down an incline into an underpass that leads to a freeway\r\nroute to the Dallas Trade Mart where the President was to deliver an\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nThree shots were heard and the President fell forward bleeding from the\r\nhead. (Governor Connolly was seriously wounded by the same gunfire.)\r\nAccording to newspaper reports (“Washington Post” November 23, 1963)\r\nBob Jackson, a Dallas “Times Herald” Photographer, said he looked\r\naround as he heard the shots and saw a rifle barrel disappearing into\r\na window on an upper floor of the nearby Texas School Book Depository\r\nBuilding.\r\n\r\nShortly following the wounding of the two men the car was driven to\r\nParkland Hospital in Dallas. In the emergency room of that hospital the\r\nPresident was attended by Dr. Malcolm Perry. Telephone communication\r\nwith Dr. Perry on November 23, 1963 develops the following information\r\nrelative to the observations made by Dr. Perry and procedures performed\r\nthere prior to death.\r\n\r\nDr. Perry noted the massive wound of the head and a second much\r\nsmaller wound of the low anterior neck in approximately the midline. A\r\ntracheostomy was performed by extending the latter wound. At this point\r\nbloody air was noted bubbling from the wound and an injury to the right\r\nlateral wall of the trachea was observed. Incisions were made in the\r\nupper anterior chest wall bilaterally to combat possible subcutaneous\r\nemphysema. Intravenous infusions of blood and saline were begun and\r\noxygen was administered. Despite these measures cardiac arrest occurred\r\nand closed chest cardiac massage failed to re-establish cardiac action.\r\nThe President was pronounced dead approximately thirty to forty minutes\r\nafter receiving his wounds.\r\n\r\nThe remains were transported via the Presidential plane to Washington,\r\nD.C. and subsequently to the Naval Medical School, National Naval\r\nMedical Center, Bethesda, Maryland for postmortem examination.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION OF BODY: The body is that of a muscular,\r\nwell-developed and well nourished adult Caucasian male measuring 72½\r\ninches and weighing approximately 170 pounds. There is beginning rigor\r\nmortis, minimal dependent livor mortis of the dorsum, and early algor\r\nmortis. The hair is reddish brown and abundant, the eyes are blue, the\r\nright pupil measuring 8 mm. in diameter, the left 4 mm. There is edema\r\nand ecchymosis of the inner canthus region of the left eyelid measuring\r\napproximately 1.5 cm. in greatest diameter. There is edema and\r\necchymosis diffusely over the right supra-orbital ridge with abnormal\r\nmobility of the underlying bone. (The remainder of the scalp will be\r\ndescribed with the skull.)\r\n\r\nThere is clotted blood on the external ears but otherwise the ears,\r\nnares, and mouth are essentially unremarkable. The teeth are in\r\nexcellent repair and there is some pallor of the oral mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nSituated on the upper right posterior thorax just above the upper\r\nborder of the scapula there is a 7 x 4 millimeter oval wound. This\r\nwound is measured to be 14 cm. from the tip of the right acromion\r\nprocess and 14 cm. below the tip of the right mastoid process.\r\n\r\nSituated in the low anterior neck at approximately the level of the\r\nthird and fourth tracheal rings is a 6.5 cm. long transverse wound with\r\nwidely gaping irregular edges. (The depth and character of these wounds\r\nwill be further described below.)\r\n\r\nSituated on the anterior chest wall in the nipple line are bilateral\r\n2 cm. long recent transverse surgical incisions into the subcutaneous\r\ntissue. The one on the left is situated 11 cm. cephalad to the nipple\r\nand the one on the right 8 cm. cephalad to the nipple. There is no\r\nhemorrhage or ecchymosis associated with these wounds. A similar clean\r\nwound measuring 2 cm. in length is situated on the antero-lateral\r\naspect of the left mid arm. Situated on the antero-lateral aspect of\r\neach ankle is a recent 2 cm. transverse incision into the subcutaneous\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\nThere is an old well healed 8 cm. McBurney abdominal incision. Over\r\nthe lumbar spine in the midline is an old, well healed 15 cm. scar.\r\nSituated on the upper antero-lateral aspect of the right thigh is an\r\nold, well healed 8 cm. scar.\r\n\r\nMISSILE WOUNDS: 1. There is a large irregular defect of the scalp and\r\nskull on the right involving chiefly the parietal bone but extending\r\nsomewhat into the temporal and occipital regions. In this region\r\nthere is an actual absence of scalp and bone producing a defect which\r\nmeasures approximately 13 cm. in greatest diameter.\r\n\r\nFrom the irregular margins of the above scalp defect tears extend in\r\nstellate fashion into the more or less intact scalp as follows:\r\n\r\na. From the right inferior temporo-parietal margin anterior to the\r\nright ear to a point slightly above the tragus.\r\n\r\nb. From the anterior parietal margin anteriorly on the forehead to\r\napproximately 4 cm. above the right orbital ridge.\r\n\r\nc. From the left margin of the main defect across the midline\r\nantero-laterally for a distance of approximately 8 cm.\r\n\r\nd. From the same starting point as c. 10 cm. postero-laterally.\r\n\r\nSituated in the posterior scalp approximately 2.5 cm. laterally to\r\nthe right and slightly above the external occipital protuberance is\r\na lacerated wound measuring 15 x 6 mm. In the underlying bone is a\r\ncorresponding wound through the skull which exhibits beveling of the\r\nmargins of the bone when viewed from the inner aspect of the skull.\r\n\r\nClearly visible in the above described large skull defect and exuding\r\nfrom it is lacerated brain tissue which on close inspection proves to\r\nrepresent the major portion of the right cerebral hemisphere. At this\r\npoint it is noted that the falx cerebri is extensively lacerated with\r\ndisruption of the superior saggital sinus.\r\n\r\nUpon reflecting the scalp multiple complete fracture lines are seen\r\nto radiate from both the large defect at the vertex and the smaller\r\nwound at the occiput. These vary greatly in length and direction, the\r\nlongest measuring approximately 19 cm. These result in the production\r\nof numerous fragments which vary in size from a few millimeters to 10\r\ncm. in greatest diameter.\r\n\r\nThe complexity of these fractures and the fragments thus produced\r\ntax satisfactory verbal description and are better appreciated in\r\nphotographs and roentgenograms which are prepared.\r\n\r\nThe brain is removed and preserved for further study following formalin\r\nfixation.\r\n\r\nReceived as separate specimens from Dallas, Texas are three fragments\r\nof skull bone which in aggregate roughly approximate the dimensions\r\nof the large defect described above. At one angle of the largest of\r\nthese fragments is a portion of the perimeter of a roughly circular\r\nwound presumably of exit which exhibits beveling of the outer aspect of\r\nthe bone and is estimated to measure approximately 2.5 to 3.0 cm. in\r\ndiameter. Roentgenograms of this fragment reveal minute particles of\r\nmetal in the bone at this margin. Roentgenograms of the skull reveal\r\nmultiple minute metallic fragments along a line corresponding with a\r\nline joining the above described small occipital wound and the right\r\nsupra-orbital ridge. From the surface of the disrupted right cerebral\r\ncortex two small irregularly shaped fragments of metal are recovered.\r\nThese measure 7 x 2 mm. and 3 x 1 mm. These are placed in the custody\r\nof Agents Francis X. O’Neill, Jr. and James W. Sibert, of the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation, who executed a receipt therefor (attached).\r\n\r\n2. The second wound presumably of entry is that described above in the\r\nupper right posterior thorax. Beneath the skin there is ecchymosis\r\nof subcutaneous tissue and musculature. The missile path through the\r\nfascia and musculature cannot be easily probed. The wound presumably\r\nof exit was that described by Dr. Malcolm Perry of Dallas in the\r\nlow anterior cervical region. When observed by Dr. Perry the wound\r\nmeasured “a few millimeters in diameter”, however it was extended\r\nas a tracheostomy incision and thus its character is distorted at\r\nthe time of autopsy. However, there is considerable ecchymosis of\r\nthe strap muscles of the right side of the neck and of the fascia\r\nabout the trachea adjacent to the line of the tracheostomy wound. The\r\nthird point of reference in connecting these two wounds is in the\r\napex (supra-clavicular portion) of the right pleural cavity. In this\r\nregion there is contusion of the parietal pleura and of the extreme\r\napical portion of the right upper lobe of the lung. In both instances\r\nthe diameter of contusion and ecchymosis at the point of maximal\r\ninvolvement measures 5 cm. Both the visceral and parietal pleura are\r\nintact overlying these areas of trauma.\r\n\r\nINCISIONS: The scalp wounds are extended in the coronal plane to\r\nexamine the cranial content and the customary (Y) shaped incision is\r\nused to examine the body cavities.\r\n\r\nTHORACIC CAVITY: The bony cage is unremarkable. The thoracic organs are\r\nin their normal positions and relationships and there is no increase in\r\nfree pleural fluid. The above described area of contusion in the apical\r\nportion of the right pleural cavity is noted.\r\n\r\nLUNGS: The lungs are of essentially similar appearance the right\r\nweighing 320 Gm., the left 290 Gm. The lungs are well aerated with\r\nsmooth glistening pleural surfaces and gray-pink color. A 5 cm.\r\ndiameter area of purplish red discoloration and increased firmness\r\nto palpation is situated in the apical portion of the right upper\r\nlobe. This corresponds to the similar area described in the overlying\r\nparietal pleura. Incision in this region reveals recent hemorrhage into\r\npulmonary parenchyma.\r\n\r\nHEART: The pericardial cavity is smooth walled and contains\r\napproximately 10 cc. of straw-colored fluid. The heart is of\r\nessentially normal external contour and weighs 350 Gm. The pulmonary\r\nartery is opened in situ and no abnormalities are noted. The cardiac\r\nchambers contain moderate amounts of postmortem clotted blood. There\r\nare no gross abnormalities of the leaflets of any of the cardiac\r\nvalves. The following are the circumferences of the cardiac valves:\r\naortic 7.5 cm., pulmonic 7 cm., tricuspid 12 cm., mitral 11 cm. The\r\nmyocardium is firm and reddish brown. The left ventricular myocardium\r\naverages 1.2 cm. in thickness, the right ventricular myocardium 0.4 cm.\r\nThe coronary arteries are dissected and are of normal distribution and\r\nsmooth walled and elastic throughout.\r\n\r\nABDOMINAL CAVITY: The abdominal organs are in their normal positions\r\nand relationships and there is no increase in free peritoneal fluid.\r\nThe vermiform appendix is surgically absent and there are a few\r\nadhesions joining the region of the cecum to the ventral abdominal\r\nwall at the above described old abdominal incisional scar.\r\n\r\nSKELETAL SYSTEM: Aside from the above described skull wounds there are\r\nno significant gross skeletal abnormalities.\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHY: Black and white and color photographs depicting\r\nsignificant findings are exposed but not developed. These photographs\r\nwere placed in the custody of Agent Roy H. Kellerman of the U. S.\r\nSecret Service, who executed a receipt therefore (attached).\r\n\r\nROENTGENOGRAMS: Roentgenograms are made of the entire body and of the\r\nseparately submitted three fragments of skull bone. These are developed\r\nand were placed in the custody of Agent Roy H. Kellerman of the U. S.\r\nSecret Service, who executed a receipt therefor (attached).\r\n\r\nSUMMARY: Based on the above observations it is our opinion that the\r\ndeceased died as a result of two perforating gunshot wounds inflicted\r\nby high velocity projectiles fired by a person or persons unknown. The\r\nprojectiles were fired from a point behind and somewhat above the level\r\nof the deceased. The observations and available information do not\r\npermit a satisfactory estimate as to the sequence of the two wounds.\r\n\r\nThe fatal missile entered the skull above and to the right of the\r\nexternal occipital protuberance. A portion of the projectile traversed\r\nthe cranial cavity in a posterior-anterior direction (see lateral skull\r\nroentgenograms) depositing minute particles along its path. A portion\r\nof the projectile made its exit through the parietal bone on the right\r\ncarrying with it portions of cerebrum, skull and scalp. The two wounds\r\nof the skull combined with the force of the missile produced extensive\r\nfragmentation of the skull, laceration of the superior saggital sinus,\r\nand of the right cerebral hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe other missile entered the right superior posterior thorax above\r\nthe scapula and traversed the soft tissues of the supra-scapular and\r\nthe supra-clavicular portions of the base of the right side of the\r\nneck. This missile produced contusions of the right apical parietal\r\npleura and of the apical portion of the right upper lobe of the lung.\r\nThe missile contused the strap muscles of the right side of the neck,\r\ndamaged the trachea and made its exit through the anterior surface of\r\nthe neck. As far as can be ascertained this missile struck no bony\r\nstructures in its path through the body.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it is our opinion that the wound of the skull produced\r\nsuch extensive damage to the brain as to preclude the possibility of\r\nthe deceased surviving this injury.\r\n\r\nA supplementary report will be submitted following more detailed\r\nexamination of the brain and of microscopic sections. However, it is\r\nnot anticipated that these examinations will materially alter the\r\nfindings.\r\n\r\nJ. J.

KENNEDY\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION REPORT No. A63-272\r\n\r\nGROSS DESCRIPTION OF BRAIN: Following formalin fixation the brain\r\nweighs 1500 gms. The right cerebral hemisphere is found to be markedly\r\ndisrupted. There is a longitudinal laceration of the right hemisphere\r\nwhich is para-sagittal in position approximately 2.5 cm. to the right\r\nof the of the midline which extends from the tip of the occipital lobe\r\nposteriorly to the tip of the frontal lobe anteriorly. The base of the\r\nlaceration is situated approximately 4.5 cm. below the vertex in the\r\nwhite matter. There is considerable loss of cortical substance above\r\nthe base of the laceration, particularly in the parietal lobe. The\r\nmargins of this laceration are at all points jagged and irregular, with\r\nadditional lacerations extending in varying directions and for varying\r\ndistances from the main laceration. In addition, there is a laceration\r\nof the corpus callosum extending from the genu to the tail. Exposed in\r\nthis latter laceration are the interiors of the right lateral and third\r\nventricles.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed from the vertex the left cerebral hemisphere is intact.\r\nThere is marked engorgement of meningeal blood vessels of the left\r\ntemporal and frontal regions with considerable associated sub-arachnoid\r\nhemorrhage. The gyri and sulci over the left hemisphere are of\r\nessentially normal size and distribution. Those on the right are too\r\nfragmented and distorted for satisfactory description.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed from the basilar aspect the disruption of the right cortex\r\nis again obvious. There is a longitudinal laceration of the mid-brain\r\nthrough the floor of the third ventricle just behind the optic chiasm\r\nand the mammillary bodies. This laceration partially communicates with\r\nan oblique 1.5 cm. tear through the left cerebral peduncle. There are\r\nirregular superficial lacerations over the basilar aspects of the left\r\ntemporal and frontal lobes.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of preserving the specimen coronal sections are not\r\nmade. The following sections are taken for microscopic examination:\r\n\r\n    a. From the margin of the laceration in the right parietal lobe.\r\n\r\n    b. From the margin of the laceration in the corpus callosum.\r\n\r\n    c. From the anterior portion of the laceration in the right\r\n    frontal lobe.\r\n\r\n    d. From the contused left fronto-parietal cortex.\r\n\r\n    e. From the line of transection of the spinal cord.\r\n\r\n    f. From the right cerebellar cortex.\r\n\r\n    g. From the superficial laceration of the basilar aspect of the\r\n    left temporal lobe.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this examination seven (7) black and white and\r\nsix (6) color 4x5 inch negatives are exposed but not developed (the\r\ncassettes containing these negatives have been delivered by hand to\r\nRear Admiral George W. Burkley, MC, USN, White House Physician).\r\n\r\nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:\r\n\r\nBRAIN: Multiple sections from representative areas as noted above are\r\nexamined. All sections are essentially similar and show extensive\r\ndisruption of brain tissue with associated hemorrhage. In none of the\r\nsections examined are there significant abnormalities other than those\r\ndirectly related to the recent trauma.\r\n\r\nHEART: Sections show a moderate amount of sub-epicardial fat. The\r\ncoronary arteries, myocardial fibers, and endocardium are unremarkable.\r\n\r\nLUNGS: Sections through the grossly described area of contusion\r\nin the right upper lobe exhibit disruption of alveolar walls and\r\nrecent hemorrhage into alveoli. Sections are otherwise essentially\r\nunremarkable.\r\n\r\nLIVER: Sections show the normal hepatic architecture to be well\r\npreserved. The parenchymal cells exhibit markedly granular cytoplasm\r\nindicating high glycogen content which is characteristic of the “liver\r\nbiopsy pattern” of sudden death.\r\n\r\nSPLEEN: Sections show no significant abnormalities.\r\n\r\nKIDNEYS: Sections show no significant abnormalities aside from\r\ndilatation and engorgement of blood vessels of all calibers.\r\n\r\nSKIN WOUNDS: Sections through the wounds in the occipital and upper\r\nright posterior thoracic regions are essentially similar. In each there\r\nis loss of continuity of the epidermis with coagulation necrosis of the\r\ntissues at the wound margins. The scalp wound exhibits several small\r\nfragments of bone at its margins in the subcutaneous tissue.\r\n\r\nFINAL SUMMARY: This supplementary report covers in more detail the\r\nextensive degree of cerebral trauma in this case. However neither this\r\nportion of the examination nor the microscopic examinations alter the\r\npreviously submitted report or add significant details to the cause of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nJ. J.

Frazier and Cortlandt Cunningham of the\r\nFBI, and Joseph D. Nicol, superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal\r\nIdentification and Investigation of the State of Illinois. Frazier has\r\nbeen in the field of firearms identification for 23 years, following a\r\n1-year course of specialized training in the FBI Laboratory. Cunningham\r\nhas been in the field for 5 years, having also completed the FBI\r\ncourse. Nicol has been in the firearms identification field since 1941,\r\nhaving begun his training in the Chicago police crime laboratory. Each\r\nhas made many thousands of firearms identification examinations.[A10-1]\r\nFrazier testified on the rifle, the rifle cartridge cases, and the\r\nrifle bullets; Cunningham on the revolver, the revolver cartridge\r\ncases, the revolver bullets, and the paraffin test; and Nicol on all\r\nthe bullets and cartridge cases and the paraffin test.[A10-2] Nicol’s\r\nconclusions were identical to those of Frazier and Cunningham, except\r\nas noted.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Principles\r\n\r\nA cartridge, or round of ammunition, is composed of a primer, a\r\ncartridge case, powder, and a bullet. The primer, a metal cup\r\ncontaining a detonable mixture, fits into the base of the cartridge\r\ncase, which is loaded with the powder. The bullet, which usually\r\nconsists of lead or of a lead core encased in a higher strength metal\r\njacket, fits into the neck of the cartridge case. To fire the bullet,\r\nthe cartridge is placed in the chamber of a firearm, immediately behind\r\nthe firearm’s barrel. The base of the cartridge rests against a solid\r\nsupport called the breech face or, in the case of a bolt-operated\r\nweapon, the bolt face. When the trigger is pulled, a firing pin strikes\r\na swift, hard blow into the primer, detonating the priming mixture. The\r\nflames from the resulting explosion ignite the powder, causing a rapid\r\ncombustion whose force propels the bullet forward through the barrel.\r\n\r\nThe barrels of modern firearms are “rifled,” that is, several spiral\r\ngrooves are cut into the barrel from end to end. The purpose of the\r\nrifling is to set the bullet spinning around its axis, giving it a\r\nstability in flight that it would otherwise lack. The weapons of a\r\ngiven make and model are alike in their rifling characteristics;\r\nthat is, number of grooves, number of lands (the raised portion of\r\nthe barrel between the grooves) and twist of the rifling. When a\r\nbullet is fired through a barrel, it is engraved with these rifling\r\ncharacteristics. For example, all S. & W. .38/200 British Service\r\nRevolvers have five grooves and five lands, which twist to the right,\r\nand bullets fired through such a revolver will have five groove and\r\nland impressions, right twist.\r\n\r\nIn addition to rifling characteristics, every weapon bears distinctive\r\nmicroscopic characteristics on its components, including its barrel,\r\nfiring pin, and breech face. While a weapon’s rifling characteristics\r\nare common to all other weapons of its make and model (and sometimes\r\neven to weapons of a different make or model), a weapon’s microscopic\r\ncharacteristics are distinctive, and differ from those of every other\r\nweapon, regardless of make and model. Such markings are initially\r\ncaused during manufacture, since the action of manufacturing tools\r\ndiffers microscopically from weapon to weapon, and since the tools\r\nchange microscopically while being operated. As a weapon is used,\r\nfurther distinctive microscopic markings are introduced by the effects\r\nof wear, fouling, and cleaning. As Frazier testified:\r\n\r\n    Q. Can you explain how you are able to come to a conclusion\r\n    that a cartridge case was fired in a particular weapon to the\r\n    exclusion of all other weapons?\r\n\r\n    MR. FRAZIER. Yes, sir; during the manufacture of a weapon,\r\n    there are certain things done to the mechanism of it, which\r\n    are by machine or by filing, by grinding, which form the\r\n    parts of the weapon into their final shape. These machining\r\n    and grinding and filing operations will mark the metal with\r\n    very fine scratches or turning marks and grinding marks in\r\n    such a way that there will be developed on the surface of\r\n    the metal a characteristic pattern. This pattern, because it\r\n    is made by these accidental machine-type operations, will be\r\n    characteristic of that particular weapon, and will not be\r\n    reproduced on separate weapons. It may be a combination of\r\n    marks that--the face of the bolt may be milled, then it may be\r\n    in part filed to smooth off the corners, and then, as a final\r\n    operation, it may be polished, or otherwise adjusted during the\r\n    hand fitting operation, so that it does have its particular\r\n    pattern of microscopic marks.\r\n\r\n    The bolt face of the 139 rifle I have photographed and enlarged\r\n    in this photograph [Commission Exhibit No. 558] to show the\r\n    types of marks I was referring to.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The marks produced during manufacture are the marks seen on\r\n    the bolt face; filing marks, machining marks of the various\r\n    types, even forging marks or casting marks if the bolt happens\r\n    to be forged or cast. And then variations which occur in\r\n    these marks during the life of the weapon are very important\r\n    in identification, because many of the machining marks can\r\n    be flattened out, can be changed, by merely a grain of sand\r\n    between the face of the cartridge case and the bolt at the time\r\n    a shot is fired, which will itself scratch and dent the bolt\r\n    face. So the bolt face will pick up a characteristic pattern of\r\n    marks which are peculiar to it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    * * * [T]he marks which are placed on any bolt face are\r\n    accidental in nature. That is, they are not placed there\r\n    intentionally in the first place. They are residual to some\r\n    machining operation, such as a milling machine, in which each\r\n    cutter of the milling tool cuts away a portion of the metal;\r\n    then the next tooth comes along and cuts away a little more,\r\n    and so on, until the final surface bears the combination of\r\n    the various teeth of the milling cutter. In following that\r\n    operation, then, the surface is additionally scratched--until\r\n    you have numerous--we call them microscopic characteristics,\r\n    a characteristic being a mark which is peculiar to a certain\r\n    place on the bolt face, and of a certain shape, it is of a\r\n    certain size, it has a certain contour, it may be just a little\r\n    dimple in the metal, or a spot of rust at one time on the face\r\n    of the bolt, or have occurred from some accidental means such\r\n    as dropping the bolt, or repeated use having flattened or\r\n    smoothed off the surface of the metal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    * * * [A]s the blade of a milling machine travels around a\r\n    surface, it takes off actually a dust--it is not actually a\r\n    piece of metal--it scrapes a little steel off in the form of\r\n    a dust--or a very fine powder or chip--that tooth leaves a\r\n    certain pattern of marks--that edge. That milling cutter may\r\n    have a dozen of these edges on its surface, and each one takes\r\n    a little more. Gradually you wear the metal down, you tear it\r\n    out actually until you are at the proper depth. Those little\r\n    pieces of metal, as they are traveling around, can also scratch\r\n    the face of the bolt--unless they are washed away. So that\r\n    you may have accidental marks from that source, just in the\r\n    machining operation.\r\n\r\n    Now, there are two types of marks produced in a cutting\r\n    operation. One, from the nicks along the cutting edge of the\r\n    tool, which are produced by a circular operating tool--which\r\n    produce very fine scratches in a circular pattern. Each time\r\n    the tool goes around, it erases those marks that were there\r\n    before. And when the tool is finally lifted out, you have a\r\n    series of marks which go around the surface which has been\r\n    machined, and you will find that that pattern of marks, as this\r\n    tool goes around, will change. In one area, it will be one set\r\n    of marks--and as you visually examine the surface of the metal,\r\n    these very fine marks will extend for a short distance, then\r\n    disappear, and a new mark of a new type will begin and extend\r\n    for a short distance. The entire surface, then, will have a--be\r\n    composed of a series of circles, but the individual marks seen\r\n    in the microscope will not be circular, will not form complete\r\n    circles around the face of the bolt.\r\n\r\n    Q. Have you had occasion to examine two consecutive bolt faces\r\n    from a factory?\r\n\r\n    A. Oh, yes.\r\n\r\n    Q. And what did you find on that examination?\r\n\r\n    A. There would be no similarity in the individual microscopic\r\n    characteristics between the two bolt faces.\r\n\r\n    Q. There actually was none?\r\n\r\n    A. No, there was none.[A10-3]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Q. How are you able to conclude that a given bullet was fired\r\n    in a given weapon to the exclusion of all other weapons, Mr.\r\n    Frazier?\r\n\r\n    A. That is based again upon the microscopic marks left on the\r\n    fired bullets and those marks in turn are based upon the barrel\r\n    from which the bullets are fired.\r\n\r\n    The marks in the barrel originate during manufacture. They\r\n    originate through use of the gun, through accidental marks\r\n    resulting from cleaning, excessive cleaning, of the weapon, or\r\n    faulty cleaning.\r\n\r\n    They result from corrosion in the barrel due to the hot gases\r\n    and possibly corrosive primer mixtures in the cartridges used,\r\n    and primarily again they result from wear, that is, an eroding\r\n    of the barrel through friction due to the firing of cartridges,\r\n    bullets through it.\r\n\r\n    In this particular barrel the manufacturer’s marks are caused\r\n    by the drill which drills out the barrel, leaving certain marks\r\n    from the drilling tool. Then portions of these marks are erased\r\n    by a rifling tool which cuts the four spiral grooves in the\r\n    barrel and, in turn, leaves marks themselves, and in connection\r\n    with those marks of course, the drilling marks, being circular\r\n    in shape, there is a tearing away of the surface of the metal,\r\n    so that a microscopically rough surface is left.\r\n\r\n    Then removing part of those marks with a separate tool causes\r\n    that barrel to assume an individual characteristic, a character\r\n    all of its own.\r\n\r\n    In other words, at that time you could identify a bullet fired\r\n    from that barrel as having been fired from the barrel to the\r\n    exclusion of all other barrels, because there is no system\r\n    whatever to the drilling of the barrel. The only system is in\r\n    the rifling or in the cutting of the grooves, and in this case\r\n    of rifle barrels, even the cutters wear down as the barrels\r\n    are made, eventually of course having to be discarded or\r\n    resharpened.\r\n\r\n    Q. Have you examined consecutively manufactured barrels to\r\n    determine whether their microscopic characteristics are\r\n    identical?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir; I have three different sets of, you might say,\r\n    paired barrels, which have been manufactured on the same\r\n    machine, one after the other, under controlled conditions to\r\n    make them as nearly alike as possible, and in each case fired\r\n    bullets from those barrels could not be identified with each\r\n    other; in fact, they looked nothing at all alike as far as\r\n    individual microscopic characteristics are concerned. Their\r\n    rifling impressions of course would be identical, but the\r\n    individual marks there would be entirely different.[A10-4]\r\n\r\nWhen a cartridge is fired, the microscopic characteristics of the\r\nweapon’s barrel are engraved into the bullet (along with its rifling\r\ncharacteristics), and the microscopic characteristics of the firing pin\r\nand breech face are engraved into the base of the cartridge case. By\r\nvirtue of these microscopic markings, an expert can frequently match\r\na bullet or cartridge case to the weapon in which it was fired. To\r\nmake such an identification, the expert compares the suspect bullet\r\nor cartridge case under a comparison microscope, side by side with a\r\ntest bullet or cartridge case which has been fired in the weapon, to\r\ndetermine whether the pattern of the markings in the test and suspect\r\nitems are sufficiently similar to show that they were fired in the same\r\nweapon. This is exemplified by Frazier’s examination of Commission\r\nExhibit No. 543, one of the cartridge cases found in the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Building after the assassination:\r\n\r\n    Q. Mr. Frazier, we were just beginning to discuss, before the\r\n    recess, Commission Exhibit 559, which is a picture, as you\r\n    described it, of Exhibit No. 543 and a test cartridge under a\r\n    microscope * * *?\r\n\r\n    MR. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Q. Could you discuss, by using that picture, some of the\r\n    markings which you have seen under the microscope and on the\r\n    basis of which you made your identification?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes, sir. In the photograph I have drawn some small circles\r\n    and numbered them, those circles, correspondingly on each side\r\n    of the photograph. The purpose of the circles is not to point\r\n    out all the similarities, but to call attention to some of them\r\n    and to help orient in locating a mark on one with a mark on\r\n    the opposite side of the photograph. In general the area shown\r\n    is immediately outside of the firing pin in the bolt of the\r\n    139 rifle, on the left side of the photograph, and Commission\r\n    Exhibit 543 on the right side.\r\n\r\n    The circles have been drawn around the dents or irregularly\r\n    shaped ridges, small bumps, and depressions on the surface of\r\n    the metal in six places on each side of the photograph. It is\r\n    an examination of these marks, and all of the marks on the\r\n    face of the breech, microscopically which permits a conclusion\r\n    to be reached. The photograph itself actually is a substitute\r\n    to show only the type of marks found rather than their nature,\r\n    that is, their height, their width, or their relationship to\r\n    each other, which is actually a mental, visual, comparison on\r\n    the two specimens themselves.\r\n\r\n    Q. Referring for a second to this mental, visual,\r\n    comparison, Mr. Frazier, would a person without firearms\r\n    training--firearms-identification training--be able to look\r\n    under a microscope and make a determination for himself\r\n    concerning whether a given cartridge case had been fired in a\r\n    given weapon?\r\n\r\n    A. In that connection that person could look through\r\n    the microscope. He may or may not see these individual\r\n    characteristics which are present, because he does not know\r\n    what to look for in the first place, and, secondly, they are of\r\n    such a nature that you have to mentally sort them out in your\r\n    mind going back and forth between one area and the other until\r\n    you form a mental picture of them in a comparison such as this.\r\n\r\n    If it was a different type of comparison, of parallel marks or\r\n    something of that nature, then he could see the marks, but in\r\n    either instance, without having compared hundreds and hundreds\r\n    of specimens, he would not be able to make any statement as to\r\n    whether or not they were fired from the same rifle.\r\n\r\n    Q. Would you say that this is, then, a matter of expert\r\n    interpretation rather than a point-for-point comparison which a\r\n    layman could make?\r\n\r\n    A. I would say so; yes. I don’t think a layman would recognize\r\n    some of the things on these cartridge cases and some shown\r\n    in the photographs as actually being significant or not\r\n    significant, because there will be things present which have\r\n    nothing whatsoever to do with the firing of the cartridge case\r\n    in the gun.\r\n\r\n    There may be a depression in the primer to begin with, and\r\n    there are no marks registered at that point as a result of\r\n    the firing. Unless these things are known to occur, someone\r\n    may actually arrive at a different conclusion, because of the\r\n    absence of similar marks.\r\n\r\n    Q. Now having reference to the specific exhibit before you,\r\n    which is 559--\r\n\r\n    A. Yes.\r\n\r\n    Q. Are all the marks shown in both photographs identical?\r\n\r\n    A. No.\r\n\r\n    Q. And could you go into detail on a mark which is not\r\n    identical to explain why you would get such a result?\r\n\r\n    A. Well, for instance, between what I have drawn here as circle\r\n    4 and circle 5, there is a slanting line from the upper left to\r\n    the lower right on C-6. This line shows as a white line in the\r\n    photograph.\r\n\r\n    On the other side there is a rough, very rough ridge which\r\n    runs through there, having an entirely different appearance\r\n    from the relatively sharp line on C-6. The significant part of\r\n    that mark is the groove in between, rather than the sharp edge\r\n    of the mark, because the sharp corner could be affected by the\r\n    hardness of the metal or the irregular surface of the primer\r\n    and the amount of pressure exerted against it, pressing it back\r\n    against the face of the bolt, at the time the cartridges were\r\n    fired. So that you would never expect all the marks on one\r\n    cartridge case to be identical with all the marks on the other\r\n    cartridge case.\r\n\r\n    In fact, you would expect many differences. But the comparison\r\n    is made on the overall pattern, contour, and nature of the\r\n    marks that are present.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Q. Again there are dissimilar marks on these two pictures [of\r\n    the firing-pin depressions on the cartridge case Commission\r\n    Exhibit No. 543, and a test cartridge case], Mr. Frazier?\r\n\r\n    A. Yes; there are, for the same reason, that metal does not\r\n    flow the same in every instance, and it will not be impressed\r\n    to the same depth and to the same amount, depending on the type\r\n    of metal, the blow that is struck, and the pressures involved.\r\n\r\n    Q. Is your identification made therefore on the basis of\r\n    the presence of similarities, as opposed to the absence of\r\n    dissimilarities?\r\n\r\n    A. No, that is not exactly right. The identification is\r\n    made on the presence of sufficient individual microscopic\r\n    characteristics so that a very definite pattern is formed and\r\n    visualized on the two surfaces.\r\n\r\n    Dissimilarities may or may not be present, depending on whether\r\n    there have been changes to the firing pin through use or wear,\r\n    whether the metal flows are the same, and whether the pressures\r\n    are the same or not.\r\n\r\n    So I don’t think we can say that it is an absence of\r\n    dissimilarities, but rather the presence of similarities.[A10-5]\r\n\r\nA bullet or cartridge case cannot always be identified with the weapon\r\nin which it was fired. In some cases, the bullet or cartridge case is\r\ntoo mutilated. In other cases, the weapon’s microscopic characteristics\r\nhave changed between the time the suspect item was fired and the time\r\nthe test item was fired--microscopic characteristics change drastically\r\nin a short period of time, due to wear, or over a longer period of\r\ntime, due to wear, corrosion, and cleaning. Still again, the weapon\r\nmay mark bullets inconsistently--for example, because the bullets are\r\nsmaller than the barrel, and travel through it erratically.[A10-6]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rifle\r\n\r\nThe rifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository\r\nshortly after the assassination was a bolt-action, clip-fed, military\r\nrifle, 40.2 inches long and 8 pounds in weight.[A10-7] Inscribed on\r\nthe rifle were various markings, including the words “CAL. 6.5,”\r\n“MADE ITALY,” “TERNI,” and “ROCCA”; the numerals “1940” and “40”;\r\nthe serial number C2766; the letters “R-E,” “PG,” and “TNI”; the\r\nfigure of a crown; and several other barely decipherable letters and\r\nnumbers.[A10-8] The rifle bore a very inexpensive Japanese four-power\r\nsight, stamped “4 x 18 COATED,” “ORDNANCE OPTICS INC.,” “HOLLYWOOD\r\nCALIFORNIA,” and “MADE IN JAPAN”[A10-9] and a sling consisting of two\r\nleather straps, one of which had a broad patch, which apparently had\r\nbeen inserted on the rifle and cut to length.[A10-10] The sling was\r\nnot a standard rifle sling, but appeared to be a musical instrument\r\nstrap or a sling from a carrying case or camera bag.[A10-11] A basic\r\npurpose of a rifle sling is to enable the rifleman to steady his grip,\r\nby wrapping the arm into the sling in a prescribed manner. The sling on\r\nthe rifle was too short to use in the normal way, but might have served\r\nto provide some additional steadiness.[A10-12]\r\n\r\nThe rifle was identified as a 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano Italian\r\nmilitary rifle, Model 91/38.[A10-13] This identification was initially\r\nmade by comparing the rifle with standard reference works and by the\r\nmarkings inscribed on the rifle.[A10-14] The caliber was independently\r\ndetermined by chambering a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5 millimeter cartridge\r\nin the rifle for fit, and by making a sulfur cast of the inside of\r\nthe rifle’s barrel which was measured with a micrometer.[A10-15] (The\r\ncaliber of a weapon is the diameter of the interior of the barrel,\r\nmeasured between opposite lands. The caliber of American weapons is\r\nexpressed in inches; thus a .30-caliber weapon has a barrel which is\r\nthirty one-hundredths or three-tenths of an inch in diameter. The\r\ncaliber of continental European weapons is measured in millimeters. A\r\n6.5-millimeter caliber weapon corresponds to an American .257-caliber\r\nweapon, that is, its barrel diameter is about one-fourth inch.)[A10-16]\r\nThe identification was later confirmed by a communication from SIFAR,\r\nthe Italian Armed Forces Intelligence Service. This communication also\r\nexplained the markings on the rifle, as follows: “CAL. 6.5” refers\r\nto the rifle’s caliber; “MADE ITALY” refers to its origin, and was\r\ninscribed at the request of the American importer prior to shipment;\r\n“TERNI” means that the rifle was manufactured and tested by the Terni\r\nArmy Plant of Terni, Italy; the number “C2766” is the serial number\r\nof the rifle, and the rifle in question is the only one of its type\r\nbearing that serial number; the numerals “1940” and “40” refer to the\r\nyear of manufacture; and the other figures, numbers, and letters are\r\nprincipally inspector’s, designer’s, or manufacturer’s marks.[A10-17]\r\n\r\nThe Model 91/38 rifle was one of the 1891 series of Italian military\r\nrifles, incorporating features designed by Ritter von Mannlicher and\r\nM. Carcano. The series originally consisted of 6.5-millimeter caliber\r\nrifles, but Model 38 of the series, designed shortly before World War\r\nII, was a 7.35-millimeter caliber. Early in World War II, however,\r\nthe Italian Government, which encountered an ammunition supply\r\nproblem, began producing many of these rifles as 6.5-millimeter caliber\r\nrifles, known as the 6.5-millimeter Model 91/38.[A10-18] The 91/38\r\nhas been imported into this country as surplus military equipment,\r\nhas been advertised quite widely, and is now fairly common in this\r\ncountry.[A10-19]\r\n\r\nLike most bolt-action military rifles, the 91/38 is operated by\r\nturning up the bolt handle, drawing the bolt to the rear, pushing the\r\nbolt forward, turning down the bolt handle, and pulling the trigger.\r\nBringing the bolt forward and turning down the bolt handle compresses\r\nthe spring which drives the firing pin, and locks the bolt into place.\r\nWhen the trigger is pulled, the cocked spring drives the firing pin\r\nforward and the cartridge is fired. The face of the bolt bears a lip,\r\ncalled the extractor, around a portion of its circumference. As the\r\nbolt is pushed forward, this lip grasps the rim of the cartridge. As\r\nthe bolt is pulled back, the extractor brings the empty cartridge case\r\nwith it, and as the cartridge case is being brought back, it strikes\r\na projection in the ejection port called the ejector, which throws it\r\nout of the rifle. Meanwhile, a leaf spring beneath the clip has raised\r\nthe next cartridge into loading position. When the bolt is brought\r\nforward, it pushes the fresh cartridge into the chamber. The trigger is\r\npulled, the cartridge is fired, the bolt handle is brought up, the bolt\r\nis brought back, and the entire cycle starts again. As long as there\r\nis ammunition in the clip, one need only work the bolt and pull the\r\ntrigger to fire the rifle.[A10-20]\r\n\r\nThe clip itself is inserted into the rifle by drawing back the bolt,\r\nand pushing the clip in from the top. The clip holds one to six\r\ncartridges.[A10-21] If six cartridges are inserted into the clip and\r\nan additional cartridge is inserted into the chamber, up to seven\r\nbullets can be fired before reloading.[A10-22] When the rifle was\r\nfound in the Texas School Book Depository Building it contained a\r\nclip[A10-23] which bore the letters “SMI” (the manufacturer’s markings)\r\nand the number “952” (possibly a part number or the manufacturer’s code\r\nnumber).[A10-24] The rifle probably was sold without a clip; however,\r\nthe clip is commonly available.[A10-25]\r\n\r\n\r\nRifle Cartridge and Cartridge Cases\r\n\r\nWhen the rifle was found, one cartridge was in the chamber.[A10-26]\r\nThe cartridge was a 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano cartridge,\r\nmanufactured by the Western Cartridge Co., at East Alton, Ill. This\r\ntype of cartridge is loaded with a full metal-jacketed, military type\r\nof bullet, weighing 160-161 grains. The bullet has parallel sides and a\r\nround nose. It is just under 1.2 inches long, and just over one-fourth\r\ninch in diameter.[A10-27] Its velocity is approximately 2,165 feet per\r\nsecond.[A10-28] The cartridge is very dependable; in tests runs by the\r\nFBI and the Infantry Weapons Evaluation Branch of the U.S. Army, the\r\nC2766 rifle was fired with this Western Cartridge Co. ammunition over\r\n100 times, with no misfires. (In contrast, some of the other ammunition\r\navailable on the market for this rifle is undesirable or of very poor\r\nquality).[A10-29] The cartridge is readily available for purchase from\r\nmail-order houses, as well as a few gunshops; some 2 million rounds\r\nhave been placed on sale in the United States.[A10-30]\r\n\r\nThe presence of the cartridge in the chamber did not necessarily mean\r\nthat the assassin considered firing another bullet, since he may have\r\nreloaded merely by reflex.[A10-31]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 558\r\n\r\nBolt face of the C2766 rifle.]\r\n\r\nApart from the cartridge in the rifle, three expended cartridge cases\r\nwere found in the southeast portion of the sixth floor of the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository Building, lying between the south wall and\r\na high stack of boxes which ran parallel to the wall.[A10-32] The\r\ncartridge cases were a short distance to the west of the southeast\r\ncorner window in that wall.[A10-33] Based on a comparison with test\r\ncartridge cases fired from the C2766 rifle, the three cartridge cases\r\nwere identified as having been fired from the C2766 rifle.[A10-34]\r\n(See Commission Exhibit No. 558, p. 556.) A test was run to determine\r\nif the cartridge-case-ejection pattern of the rifle was consistent\r\nwith the assumption that the assassin had fired from the southeast\r\nwindow.[A10-35] In this test, 11 cartridges were fired from the rifle\r\nwhile it was depressed 45° downward, and 8 cartridges were fired from\r\nthe rifle while it was held horizontally. The elevation of the ejected\r\ncartridge cases above the level of the ejection port, and the points\r\non the floor at which the ejection cartridge cases initially landed,\r\nwere then plotted. The results of these tests are illustrated by the\r\ndiagrams, Commission Exhibits Nos. 546 and 547. Briefly, Commission\r\nExhibit No. 547 shows that with the weapon depressed at a 45° angle,\r\nthe cartridge cases did not rise more than 2 inches above the ejection\r\nport; with the weapon held horizontally, they did not rise more than\r\n12 inches above the ejection port.[A10-36] Commission Exhibit No. 546\r\nshows that if a circle was drawn around the initial landing points of\r\nthe cartridge cases which were ejected in the test while the rifle\r\nwas held depressed at 45°, the center of the circle would be located\r\n86 inches and 80° to the right of the rifle’s line of sight; if a\r\ncircle was drawn around the initial landing points of the cartridge\r\ncases ejected while the rifle was held horizontally, the center of the\r\ncircle would be 80 inches and 90° to the right of the line of sight.\r\nIn other words, the cartridge cases were ejected to the right of and\r\nat roughly a right angle to the rifle.[A10-37] The cartridge cases\r\nshowed considerable ricochet after their initial landing, bouncing\r\nfrom 8 inches to 15 feet.[A10-38] The location of the cartridge cases\r\nwas therefore consistent with the southeast window having been used by\r\nthe assassin, since if the assassin fired from that window the ejected\r\ncartridge cases would have hit the pile of boxes at his back and\r\nricocheted between the boxes and the wall until they came to rest to\r\nthe west of the window.[A10-39]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rifle Bullets\r\n\r\nIn addition to the three cartridge cases found in the Texas School\r\nBook Depository Building, a nearly whole bullet was found on Governor\r\nConnally’s stretcher and two bullet fragments were found in the front\r\nof the President’s car.[A10-40] The stretcher bullet weighed 158.6\r\ngrains, or several grains less than the average Western Cartridge Co.\r\n6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano bullet.[A10-41] It was slightly\r\nflattened, but otherwise unmutilated.[A10-42] The two bullet fragments\r\nweighed 44.6 and 21.0 grains, respectively[A10-43] The heavier fragment\r\nwas a portion of a bullet’s nose area, as shown by its rounded contour\r\nand the character of the markings it bore.[A10-44] The lighter fragment\r\nconsisted of bullet’s base portion, as shown by its shape and by the\r\npresence of a cannelure.[A10-45] The two fragments were both mutilated,\r\nand it was not possible to determine from the fragments themselves\r\nwhether they comprised the base and nose of one bullet or of two\r\nseparate bullets.[A10-46] However, each had sufficient unmutilated\r\narea to provide the basis of an identification.[A10-47] Based on a\r\ncomparison with test bullets fired from the C2766 rifle, the stretcher\r\nbullet and both bullet fragments were identified as having been fired\r\nfrom the C2766 rifle.[A10-48]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Revolver\r\n\r\nThe revolver taken from Oswald at the time of his arrest was a .38\r\nSpecial S. & W. Victory Model revolver.[A10-49] It bore the serial\r\nNo. V510210, and is the only such revolver with that serial number,\r\nsince S. & W. does not repeat serial numbers.[A10-50] The revolver was\r\noriginally made in the United States, but was shipped to England, as\r\nshown by the English inspection or proof marks on the chambers.[A10-51]\r\nThe revolver showed definite signs of use but was in good operating\r\ncondition.[A10-52] The revolver was originally designed to fire a\r\n.38 S. & W. cartridge, whose bullet is approximately 12 or 13 grains\r\nlighter than the .38 Special, and approximately .12 inches shorter,\r\nbut has a somewhat larger diameter.[A10-53] In the United States, the\r\n.38 Special is considered to be a better bullet than the .38 S. &\r\nW.,[A10-54] and the revolver was rechambered for a .38 Special prior to\r\nbeing sold in the United States.[A10-55] The weapon was not rebarreled,\r\nalthough the barrel was shortened by cutting off approximately 2¾ of\r\nits original 5 inches.[A10-56] The shortening of the barrel had no\r\nfunctional value, except to facilitate concealment.[A10-57]\r\n\r\nThe weapon is a conventional revolver, with a rotating cylinder holding\r\none to six cartridges. It is loaded by swinging out the cylinder and\r\ninserting cartridges into the cylinder’s chambers. If all six chambers\r\nare loaded, the weapon can be fired six consecutive times without\r\nreloading.[A10-58] To extract empty cartridge cases, the cylinder\r\nis swung out and an ejector rod attached to the cylinder is pushed,\r\nsimultaneously ejecting all the cartridge cases (and cartridges) in the\r\ncylinder. If both live cartridges and expended cartridge cases are in\r\nthe cylinder, before pushing the ejection rod one can tip the cylinder\r\nand dump the live cartridges into his hand.[A10-59] The cartridge cases\r\nwill not fall out, because they are lighter than the cartridges, and\r\nwhen fired they will have expanded so as to tightly fit the chamber\r\nwalls.[A10-60]\r\n\r\nIn a crouched stance a person can fire five shots with the revolver in\r\n3-4 seconds with no trouble, and would need no training to hit a human\r\nbody four times in four or five shots at a range of 8 feet.[A10-61] A\r\nperson who had any training with the weapon would not find its recoil\r\nnoticeable.[A10-62]\r\n\r\n\r\nRevolver Cartridges and Cartridge Cases\r\n\r\nWhen Oswald was arrested six live cartridges were found in the\r\nrevolver.[A10-63] Three were Western .38 Specials, loaded with\r\ncopper-coated lead bullets, and three were Remington-Peters .38\r\nSpecials, loaded with lead bullets.[A10-64] Five additional live\r\ncartridges were found in Oswald’s pocket,[A10-65] all of which were\r\nWestern .38 Specials, loaded with copper-coated bullets.[A10-66] The\r\nWestern and Remington-Peters .38 Special cartridges are virtually\r\nidentical--the copper coating on the Western bullets is not a full\r\njacket, but only a gilding metal, put on principally for sales\r\nappeal.[A10-67]\r\n\r\nFour expended cartridge cases were found near the site of the Tippit\r\nkilling.[A10-68] Two of these cartridge cases were Remington-Peters\r\n.38 Specials and two were Western .38 Specials.[A10-69] Based on a\r\ncomparison with test cartridge cases fired in the V510210 revolver,\r\nthe four cartridge cases were identified as having been fired in the\r\nV510210 revolver.[A10-70]\r\n\r\n\r\nRevolver Bullets\r\n\r\nFour bullets were recovered from the body of Officer Tippit.[A10-71]\r\nIn Nicol’s opinion one of the four bullets could be positively\r\nidentified with test bullets fired from V510210 revolver, and the\r\nother three could have been fired from that revolver.[A10-72] In\r\nCunningham’s opinion all four bullets could have been fired from\r\nthe V510210 revolver, but none could be positively identified to\r\nthe revolver[A10-73]--that is, in his opinion the bullets bore the\r\nrevolver’s rifling characteristics, but no conclusion could be drawn\r\non the basis of microscopic characteristics.[A10-74] Cunningham did\r\nnot conclude that the bullets had not been fired from the revolver,\r\nsince he found that consecutive bullets fired in the revolver by\r\nthe FBI could not even be identified with each other under the\r\nmicroscope.[A10-75] The apparent reasons for this was that while the\r\nrevolver had been rechambered for a .38 Special cartridge, it had not\r\nbeen rebarreled for a .38 Special bullet. The barrel was therefore\r\nslightly oversized for a .38 Special bullet, which has a smaller\r\ndiameter than a .38 S. & W. bullet. This would cause the passage of\r\na .38 Special bullet through the barrel to be erratic, resulting in\r\ninconsistent microscopic markings.[A10-76]\r\n\r\nBased on the number of grooves, groove widths, groove spacing, and\r\nknurling on the four recovered bullets, three were copper-coated lead\r\nbullets of Western-Winchester manufacture (Western and Winchester are\r\ndivisions of the same company), and the fourth was a lead bullet of\r\nRemington-Peters manufacture.[A10-77] This contrasts with the four\r\nrecovered cartridge cases, which consisted of two Remington-Peters\r\nand two Westerns. There are several possible explanations for this\r\nvariance: (1) the killer fired five cartridges, three of which were\r\nWestern-Winchester and two of which were Remington-Peters; one\r\nRemington-Peters bullet missed Tippit; and a Western-Winchester\r\ncartridge case and the Remington-Peters bullet that missed were simply\r\nnot found. (2) The killer fired only four cartridges, three of which\r\nwere Western-Winchester and one of which was Remington-Peters; prior to\r\nthe shooting the killer had an expended Remington-Peters cartridge case\r\nin his revolver, which was ejected with the three Western-Winchester\r\nand one Remington-Peters cases; and one of the Western-Winchester\r\ncases was not found. (3) The killer was using hand-loaded ammunition,\r\nthat is, ammunition which is made with used cartridge cases to save\r\nmoney; thus he might have loaded one make of bullet into another\r\nmake of cartridge case.[A10-78] This third possibility is extremely\r\nunlikely, because when a cartridge is fired the cartridge case expands,\r\nand before it can be reused it must be resized. There was, however,\r\nno evidence that any of the four recovered cartridge cases had been\r\nresized.[A10-79]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Struggle for the Revolver\r\n\r\nOfficer McDonald of the Dallas police, who arrested Oswald, stated\r\nthat he had struggled with Oswald for possession of the revolver and\r\nthat in the course of the struggle, “I heard the snap of the hammer,\r\nand the pistol crossed my left cheek * * * the primer of one round was\r\ndented on misfire at the time of the struggle. * * *”[A10-80] However,\r\nnone of the cartridges found in the revolver bore the impression of\r\nthe revolver’s firing pin.[A10-81] In addition, the revolver is so\r\nconstructed that the firing pin cannot strike a cartridge unless the\r\nhammer (which bears the firing pin) has first been drawn all the way\r\nback by a complete trigger pull.[A10-82] Had the hammer gone all the\r\nway back and then hit the cartridge, it is unlikely that the cartridge\r\nwould have misfired.[A10-83] It would be possible for a person to\r\ninterject his finger between the hammer and the cartridge, but the\r\nspring driving the hammer is a very strong one and the impact of the\r\nfiring pin into a finger would be clearly felt.[A10-84] However, the\r\ncylinder and the trigger are interconnected and the trigger cannot be\r\nfully pulled back if the cylinder is grasped.[A10-85] Therefore, if\r\nOswald had pulled on the trigger while McDonald was firmly grasping the\r\ncylinder, the revolver would not have fired, and if the gun was grabbed\r\naway at the same time the trigger would have snapped back with an\r\naudible sound.[A10-86]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Paraffin Test\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the interrogation of Lee Harvey Oswald following\r\nthe assassination a paraffin test was performed by the Dallas police\r\non both of his hands and his right cheek. The paraffin cast of Oswald’s\r\nhands reacted positively to the test. The cast of the right cheek\r\nshowed no reaction.[A10-87]\r\n\r\nTo perform the paraffin test, layers of warm liquid paraffin,\r\ninterleaved with layers of gauze for reinforcement, are brushed or\r\npoured on the suspect’s skin. The warm sticky paraffin opens the\r\nskin’s pores and picks up any dirt and foreign material present at the\r\nsurface. When the paraffin cools and hardens it forms a cast, which\r\nis taken off and processed with diphenylamine or diphenylbenzidine,\r\nchemicals which turn blue in the presence of nitrates. Since gunpowder\r\nresidues contain nitrates, the theory behind the test is that if a cast\r\nreacts positively, i.e., if blue dots appear, it provides evidence that\r\nthe suspect recently fired a weapon.[A10-88] In fact, however, the test\r\nis completely unreliable in determining either whether a person has\r\nrecently fired a weapon or whether he has not.[A10-89] On the one hand,\r\ndiphenylamine and diphenylbenzidine will react positively not only\r\nwith nitrates from gunpowder residues, but nitrates from other sources\r\nand most oxidizing agents, including dichromates, permanganates,\r\nhypochlorates, periodates, and some oxides. Thus, contact with\r\ntobacco, Clorox, urine, cosmetics, kitchen matches, pharmaceuticals,\r\nfertilizers, or soils, among other things, may result in a positive\r\nreaction to the paraffin test. Also, the mere handling of a weapon may\r\nleave nitrates on the skin.[A10-90] A positive reaction is, therefore,\r\nvalueless in determining whether a suspect has recently fired a weapon.\r\nConversely, a person who has recently fired a weapon may not show a\r\npositive reaction to the paraffin test, particularly if the weapon was\r\na rifle. A revolver is so constructed that there is a space between the\r\ncylinder, which bears the chambers, and the barrel. When a revolver is\r\nfired, nitrate-bearing gases escape through this space and may leave\r\nresidues on the hand.[A10-91] In a rifle, however, there is no gap\r\nbetween the chamber and the barrel, and one would therefore not expect\r\nnitrates to be deposited upon a person’s hands or cheeks as a result of\r\nhis firing a rifle. As Cunningham testified:\r\n\r\n    Mr. CUNNINGHAM. * * * I personally wouldn’t expect to find any\r\n    residues on a person’s right cheek after firing a rifle due to\r\n    the fact that by the very principles and the manufacture and\r\n    the action, the cartridge itself is sealed into the chamber\r\n    by the bolt being closed behind it, and upon firing the case,\r\n    the cartridge case expands into the chamber filling it up and\r\n    sealing it off from the gases, so none will come back in your\r\n    face, and so by its very nature, I would not expect to find\r\n    residue on the right cheek of a shooter.[A10-92]\r\n\r\nThe unreliability of the paraffin test has been demonstrated by\r\nexperiments run by the FBI. In one experiment, conducted prior to the\r\nassassination, paraffin tests were performed on 17 men who had just\r\nfired 5 shots with a .38-caliber revolver. Eight men tested negative\r\nin both hands, three men tested positive on the idle hand and negative\r\non the firing hand, two men tested positive on the firing hand and\r\nnegative on the idle hand, and four men tested positive on both their\r\nfiring and idle hands.[A10-93] In a second experiment, paraffin tests\r\nwere performed on 29 persons, 9 of whom had just fired a revolver or\r\nan automatic, and 20 of whom had not fired a weapon. All 29 persons\r\ntested positive on either or both hands.[A10-94] In a third experiment,\r\nperformed after the assassination, an agent of the FBI, using the C2766\r\nrifle, fired three rounds of Western 6.5-millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano\r\nammunition in rapid succession. A paraffin test was then performed on\r\nboth of his hands and his right cheek. Both of his hands and his cheek\r\ntested negative.[A10-95]\r\n\r\nThe paraffin casts of Oswald’s hands and right cheek were also examined\r\nby neutron-activation analyses at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\r\nBarium and antimony were found to be present on both surfaces of all\r\nthe casts and also in residues from the rifle cartridge cases and\r\nthe revolver cartridge cases.[A10-96] Since barium and antimony were\r\npresent in both the rifle and the revolver cartridge cases, their\r\npresence on the casts were not evidence that Oswald had fired the\r\nrifle. Moreover, the presence on the inside surface of the cheek cast\r\nof a lesser amount of barium, and only a slightly greater amount of\r\nantimony, than was found on the outside surface of the cast rendered it\r\nimpossible to attach significance to the presence of these elements on\r\nthe inside surface. Since the outside surface had not been in contact\r\nwith Oswald’s cheek, the barium and antimony found there had come from\r\na source other than Oswald. Furthermore, while there was more barium\r\nand antimony present on the casts than would normally be found on\r\nthe hands of a person who had not fired a weapon or handled a fired\r\nweapon, it is also true that barium and antimony may be present in many\r\ncommon items; for example, barium may be present in grease, ceramics,\r\nglass, paint, printing ink, paper, rubber, plastics, leather, cloth,\r\npyrotechnics, oilcloth and linoleum, storage batteries, matches and\r\ncosmetics; antimony is present in matches, type metal, lead alloys,\r\npaints and lacquers, pigments for oil and water colors, flameproof\r\ntextiles, storage batteries, pyrotechnics, rubber, pharmaceutical\r\npreparations and calico; and both barium and antimony are present in\r\nprinted paper and cloth, paint, storage batteries, rubber, matches,\r\npyrotechnics, and possibly other items. However, the barium and\r\nantimony present in these items are usually not present in a form which\r\nwould lead to their adhering to the skin of a person who had handled\r\nsuch items.[A10-97]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Walker Bullet\r\n\r\nOn April 10, 1963, a bullet was recovered from General Walker’s\r\nhome, following an attempt on his life.[A10-98] The bullet, which was\r\nseverely mutilated, weighed 148.25 grains.[A10-99] This bullet had\r\nthe rifling characteristics of the C2766 rifle and all its remaining\r\nphysical characteristics were the same as the Western 6.5 millimeter\r\nMannlicher-Carcano bullet. However, while the bullet could have been\r\nfired from the C2766 rifle, it was severely mutilated and in Frazier’s\r\nopinion could not be identified as having been fired or not fired from\r\nthat rifle.[A10-100] Nicol agreed that a positive identification could\r\nnot be made, but concluded there was “a fair probability” that the\r\nbullet had been fired from the same rifle as the test bullets.[A10-101]\r\n\r\n\r\nFINGERPRINTS AND PALMPRINTS\r\n\r\nTwo experts gave testimony concerning fingerprints and palmprints:\r\nSebestian Latona[A10-102] and Arthur Mandella.[A10-103] Latona is the\r\nsupervisor of the Latent Fingerprint Section of the Identification\r\nDivision of the FBI. He has been with that Division over 32 years,\r\nhaving begun as a student fingerprint classifier and worked up to his\r\npresent position. Mandella is a detective and fingerprint instructor\r\nwith the police department of the city of New York. He has been in\r\nthe fingerprint field for 19 years. Both have made a vast number of\r\nfingerprint examinations and have testified in Federal, State, and\r\nmilitary courts.[A10-104] Their conclusions were identical, except as\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Principles[A10-105]\r\n\r\nFingerprints and palmprints are made by the ridges which cover the\r\nsurface of the fingers and palms. These ridges first appear 2 or 3\r\nmonths before birth, and remain unchanged until death. Commission\r\nExhibit No. 634-A (p. 564) illustrates several common characteristics\r\nor “points” formed by the ridges; a clear fingerprint impression will\r\ncontain anywhere from 85 to 125 such points. While many of the common\r\npoints appear in almost every print, no two prints have the same points\r\nin the same relationship to each other.\r\n\r\nA print taken by a law-enforcement agency is known as an “inked print,”\r\nand is carefully taken so that all the characteristics of the print are\r\nreproduced on the fingerprint card; a print which is left accidentally,\r\nsuch as a print left at the scene of a crime, is known as a latent\r\nprint. To make an identification of a latent print, the expert compares\r\nthe points in the latent print with the points in an inked print. If a\r\npoint appearing in a latent print does not appear in the inked print,\r\nor vice versa, the expert concludes that the two prints were not made\r\nby the same finger or palm. An identification is made only if there\r\nare no inconsistencies between the inked and latent prints, and the\r\npoints of similarity and their relative positions are sufficiently\r\ndistinctive, and sufficient in number, to satisfy the expert that an\r\nidentity exists.[A10-106]\r\n\r\nThere is some disagreement concerning whether a minimum number of\r\npoints is necessary for an identification. Some foreign law-enforcement\r\nagencies require a minimum number of 16 points. However, in the\r\nUnited States, in which there has been a great deal of experience\r\nwith fingerprints, expert opinion holds there is no minimum number\r\nof points, and that each print must be evaluated on its own\r\nmerits.[A10-107]\r\n\r\nPalmprints are as distinctive as fingerprints, but are not as popularly\r\nknown. Possibly this is because law enforcement agencies usually record\r\nonly fingerprints for their identification files, since fingerprints\r\ncan be much more readily classified and filed than palmprints. Also,\r\nlatent fingerprint impressions are probably more common than latent\r\npalmprint impressions, because persons generally touch objects with\r\ntheir fingers rather than their palms. However, palmprints will\r\nfrequently be found on heavy objects, since the palms as well as the\r\nfingers are employed in handling such objects.[A10-108]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 634-A\r\n\r\nRidge Characteristics\r\n\r\nUsed by Experts in Comparing Fingerprints]\r\n\r\nA latent print is the result of perspiration exuded by the sweat pores\r\nin the ridges. This perspiration is composed of water, protein or\r\nfatty materials, and sodium chloride (salt). A latent print can be\r\ndeveloped--made visible--in several ways. Sometimes a latent print can\r\nbe developed merely by the use of correct lighting. A second method\r\nis to brush the print very lightly with a powder, which adheres to\r\nits outline. Once a print is powdered it can be photographed, lifted,\r\nor both. (In lifting, an adhesive substance, such as scotch tape, is\r\nplaced over a powdered print. When the adhesive is lifted the powder\r\nclings to its surface. The adhesive is then mounted.) However, powder\r\nis usually effective only on objects which have a hard, smooth,\r\nnonabsorbent surface, such as glass, tile, and various types of highly\r\npolished metals and is usually not effective on absorbent materials,\r\nsuch as paper or unfinished wood or metal, which absorb perspiration\r\nso that there is nothing on the material’s surface to which the powder\r\ncan adhere. Prints on absorbent materials can sometimes be developed\r\nby iodine fumes, which may react with fatty or protein materials which\r\nhave been absorbed into the object, or by a silver nitrate solution,\r\nwhich may react with sodium chloride which has been absorbed into the\r\nobject.[A10-109]\r\n\r\nNot every contact of a finger or palm leaves a latent print. For\r\nexample, if the surface is not susceptible to a latent print, if the\r\nfinger or palm had no perspiration, or if the perspiration was mostly\r\nwater and had evaporated, no print will be found.[A10-110]\r\n\r\n\r\nObjects in the Texas School Book Depository Building\r\n\r\nA number of objects found in the Texas School Book Depository Building\r\nfollowing the assassination were processed for latent fingerprints by\r\nthe FBI--in some cases, after they had been processed by the Dallas\r\npolice. These objects included the homemade wrapping paper bag found\r\nnear the southeast corner window; the, C2766 rifle; three small cartons\r\nwhich were stacked near that window (which were marked “Box A,” “Box\r\nB,” and “Box C”),[A10-111] and a fourth carton resting on the floor\r\nnearby (marked “Box D”);[A10-112] the three 6.5-millimeter cartridge\r\ncases found near the window; and the cartridge found in the rifle. The\r\nresults were as follows:\r\n\r\n_The paper bag._--The FBI developed a palmprint and a fingerprint\r\non the paper bag by silver nitrate. These were compared with the\r\nfingerprints and palmprints of Lee Harvey Oswald taken by the Dallas\r\npolice, and were found to have been made by the right palm and the left\r\nindex finger of Lee Harvey Oswald.[A10-113]\r\n\r\n_The C2766 rifle._--The wood and metal of the rifle was absorbent,\r\nand not conducive to recording a good print.[A10-114] However, the\r\nDallas police developed by powder some faint ridge formations on the\r\nmetal magazine housing in front of the trigger and also developed\r\nby powder and lifted a latent palmprint from the underside of the\r\nbarrel.[A10-115] The faint ridge formations were insufficient\r\nfor purposes of effecting an identification,[A10-116] but the\r\nlatent palmprint was identified as the right palm of Lee Harvey\r\nOswald.[A10-117]\r\n\r\n_The cartons._--Using the silver nitrate method, the FBI developed\r\nnine identifiable latent fingerprints and four identifiable latent\r\npalmprints on Box A,[A10-118] seven identifiable fingerprints and\r\ntwo identifiable palmprints on Box B,[A10-119] and two identifiable\r\nfingerprints and one identifiable palmprint on Box C.[A10-120] One of\r\nthe fingerprints on Box A was identified as the right index fingerprint\r\nof Lee Harvey Oswald,[A10-121] and one of the palmprints on Box A was\r\nidentified as the left palmprint of Lee Harvey Oswald.[A10-122] All the\r\nremaining prints on Box A were the palmprints of R. L. Studebaker, a\r\nDallas police officer, and Forest L. Lucy, an FBI clerk, who shipped\r\nthe cartons from Dallas to the FBI Laboratory in Washington, D.C., and\r\nfingerprints of Detective Studebaker. All but one of the fingerprints\r\non Box B belonged to Studebaker and Lucy and one palmprint was that of\r\nStudebaker. The fingerprints on Box C were those of Studebaker and Lucy\r\nand the palmprint was Studebaker’s.[A10-123] One palmprint on Box B was\r\nunidentified.[A10-124]\r\n\r\nThe FBI developed two fingerprints on Box D by silver nitrate, and the\r\nDallas police developed a palmprint on Box D by powder.[A10-125] The\r\nfingerprints belonged to Lucy. The palmprint was identified as the\r\nright palmprint of Lee Harvey Oswald.[A10-126] While the age of a print\r\ncannot be generally determined,[A10-127] this palmprint must have been\r\nrelatively fresh, because the carton was constructed of cardboard,\r\nan absorbent material, and if a long period had elapsed between the\r\ntime the print was made and the time it was powdered, the perspiration\r\nwould have been absorbed into the cardboard, and the print could not\r\nhave been developed by powder.[A10-128] Tests run by the FBI show that\r\nusually a latent impression on such cardboard cannot be developed by\r\npowder more than 24 hours after it is made.[A10-129] Latona felt that\r\nthe maximum age of the palmprint on Box D at the time of development\r\n(which was shortly after the assassination), would have been 3\r\ndays;[A10-130] Mandella felt that the maximum time would have been a\r\nday and a half.[A10-131]\r\n\r\n_The three cartridge cases and the cartridge case found in the\r\nrifle._--No prints were developed on the cartridge found in the rifle\r\nor on the three expended cartridge cases.[A10-132]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONED DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nTwo experts gave testimony concerning questioned documents: Alwyn\r\nCole[A10-133] and James C. Cadigan.[A10-134] Cole apprenticed as a\r\nquestioned document examiner for 6 years, from 1929 to 1935, and has\r\nbeen examiner of questioned documents for the U.S. Treasury Department\r\nsince then. Cadigan has been a questioned document examiner with the\r\nFBI for 23½ years, following a specialized course of training and\r\ninstruction. Both have testified many times in Federal and States\r\ncourts.[A10-135] Their conclusions were identical, except as noted.\r\n\r\nBoth experts examined and testified on the following questioned\r\ndocuments: (1) The mail order to Klein’s Sporting Goods of Chicago,\r\nin response to which Klein’s sent the C2766 rifle; the accompanying\r\nmoney order; and the envelope in which the mail order and the money\r\norder were sent--all of which bore the name “A. Hidell” and the\r\naddress “P.O. Box 2915, Dallas, Texas”;[A10-136] (2) the mail order\r\nto Seaport Traders, Inc., of Los Angeles, bearing the same name and\r\naddress, in response to which the Seaport Traders sent the V510210\r\nrevolver;[A10-137] (3) part of an application for Post Office Box\r\n2915, Dallas, Tex., opened October 9, 1962 and closed May 14, 1963,\r\nand two change-of-address orders relating to that box, dated October\r\n10, 1962 and May 12, 1963--all signed “Lee H. Oswald,” and part of an\r\napplication for Post Office Box 30061, New Orleans, La., naming “A. J.\r\nHidell” as a party entitled to receive mail through the box, signed “L.\r\nH. Oswald”;[A10-138] (4) a spurious selective service system notice\r\nof classification and a spurious certificate of service in the U.S.\r\nMarine Corps, found in Oswald’s wallet after his arrest, both in the\r\nname “Alek James Hidell”;[A10-139] (5) a spurious smallpox vaccination\r\ncertificate, found among Oswald’s belongings at his room at 1026\r\nNorth Beckley, purportedly issued to Lee Oswald by “Dr. A. J. Hideel,\r\nP.O. Box 30016, New Orleans, La.”;[A10-140] and (6) a card, found in\r\nOswald’s wallet after his arrest, reading “Fair Play for Cuba Committee\r\nNew Orleans Chapter,” dated “June 15, 1963,” bearing the name “L. H.\r\nOswald” and the signature “Lee H. Oswald,” and signed “A. J. Hidell”\r\nas chapter president.[A10-141] Cadigan also examined (7) the unsigned\r\nnote, Commission Exhibit No. 1, written almost entirely in Russian,\r\nwhich Marina testified Oswald had left for her prior to his attempt on\r\nthe life of General Walker;[A10-142] and (8) the homemade paper bag\r\nfound on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository following\r\nthe assassination.[A10-143]\r\n\r\n_General principles._[A10-144]--The area of questioned document\r\nexamination encompasses many types of inquiries, the most familiar of\r\nwhich is the identification of handwriting. Handwriting identification\r\nis based upon the principle that every person’s handwriting is\r\ndistinctive. As Cole testified:\r\n\r\n    Q. Mr. Cole, could you explain the basis on which you were able\r\n    to make an identification of a questioned writing as being\r\n    authored by the person who wrote a standard writing?\r\n\r\n    Mr. COLE. This is based upon the principle that every\r\n    handwriting is distinctive, that since the mental and physical\r\n    equipment for producing handwriting is different in every\r\n    individual, each person produces his own distinctive writing\r\n    habits. Of course, everyone learns to write in the beginning\r\n    by an endeavor to repeat ideal letter forms but, practically\r\n    no one is able to reproduce these forms exactly. Even though a\r\n    person might have some initial success during the active period\r\n    of instruction, he soon departs from these and develops his\r\n    own habits. It may be said that habit in handwriting is that\r\n    which makes handwriting possible. Habit is that which makes\r\n    handwriting efficient. If it were not for the development of\r\n    habit, one would be obliged to draw or sketch.\r\n\r\n    Some habit would be included even in those efforts. But the\r\n    production of handwriting rapidly and fluently always involves\r\n    a recording of personal writing habit. This has been confirmed\r\n    by observation of a very large number of specimens over a long\r\n    period of time, and it has further been demonstrated by, on my\r\n    part, having a formal responsibility for rendering decisions\r\n    about the identification of handwriting based upon an agreement\r\n    of handwriting habit in situations where there would be a\r\n    rigorous testing of the correctness of these decision by field\r\n    investigators, for example, of the law-enforcement agencies,\r\n    and a demonstration that these results were confirmed by other\r\n    evidence.\r\n\r\n    This is the basis for identification of handwriting.[A10-145]\r\n\r\nThe same principles are generally applicable to hand printing,[A10-146]\r\nand in the balance of this section the term “handwriting” will be used\r\nto refer to both cursive or script writing and hand printing.\r\n\r\nNot every letter in a questioned handwriting can be used as the\r\nbasis of an identification. Most people learn to write letters in\r\na standard or “copybook” form: a handwriting is distinctive only\r\ninsofar as it departs significantly from such forms.[A10-147]\r\nCorrespondingly, not every variation indicates nonidentification;\r\nno two acts are precisely alike and variations may be found within\r\na single document. Like similarities, variations are significant\r\nonly if they are distinctive.[A10-148] Moreover, since any single\r\ndistinctive characteristic may not be unique to one person, in order\r\nto make an identification the expert must find a sufficient number of\r\ncorresponding distinctive characteristics and a general absence of\r\ndistinctive differences.[A10-149]\r\n\r\nThe possibility that one person could imitate the handwriting of\r\nanother and successfully deceive an expert document examiner is very\r\nremote. A forger leaves two types of clue. First, he can seldom\r\nperfectly simulate the letter forms of the victim; concentrating on\r\nthe reproduction of one detail, he is likely not to see others. Thus,\r\nthe forger may successfully imitate the general form of a letter, but\r\nget proportions or letter connections wrong. In addition, the forger\r\ndraws rather than writes. Forged writing is therefore distinguished by\r\ndefects in the quality of its line, such as tremor, waver, patching,\r\nretouching, noncontinuous lines, and pen lifts in awkward and unusual\r\nplaces.[A10-150]\r\n\r\nTo make a handwriting identification, the handwriting in the document\r\nunder examination (the questioned document) is compared against the\r\nhandwriting in documents known to have been prepared by a suspect (the\r\nknown or standard documents). This is exemplified by Cole’s examination\r\nof Commission Exhibit No. 773, the photograph of the mail order for the\r\nrifle and the envelope in which it was sent:\r\n\r\n    Q. Now, Mr. Cole, returning to 773, the questioned document,\r\n    can you tell the Commission how you formed the conclusion that\r\n    it was prepared by the author of the standards, that is, what\r\n    steps you followed in your examination and comparison, what\r\n    things you considered, what instruments or equipment you used,\r\n    and so forth?\r\n\r\n    Mr. COLE. I made first a careful study of the writing on\r\n    Commission Exhibit 773 without reference to the standard\r\n    writing, in an effort to determine whether or not this writing\r\n    contained what I would regard as a basis for identification,\r\n    contained a record of writing habit, and as that--as a result\r\n    of that part of my examination, I concluded that this is a\r\n    natural handwriting. By that I mean that it was made at a\r\n    fair speed, that it doesn’t show any evidence of an unnatural\r\n    movement, poor line quality, tremor, waver, retouching, or the\r\n    like. I regard it as being made in a fluent and fairly rapid\r\n    manner which would record the normal writing habits of the\r\n    person who made it.\r\n\r\n    I then made a separate examination of the standards, of all of\r\n    the standard writings, to determine whether that record gave a\r\n    record of writing habit which could be used for identification\r\n    purposes, and I concluded that it, too, was a natural\r\n    handwriting and gave a good record of writing habit.\r\n\r\n    I then brought the standard writings together with the\r\n    questioned writing for a detailed and orderly comparison,\r\n    considering details of letter forms, proportion, pen pressure,\r\n    letter connections, and other details of handwriting habit * *\r\n    *.[A10-151]\r\n\r\nThe standards used by Cole and Cadigan consisted of a wide variety\r\nof documents known to be in the handwriting of Lee Harvey Oswald,\r\nincluding indorsements on his payroll checks, applications for\r\nemployment, for a passport, for membership in the American Civil\r\nLiberties Union, and for a library card, and letters to the Immigration\r\nand Naturalization Service, the Marine Corps, the State Department, and\r\nthe American Embassy in Russia.[A10-152]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mail Order for the C2766 Rifle, the Related Envelope, and the Money\r\nOrder\r\n\r\nThe mail order and envelope for the C2766 rifle were photographed\r\nby Klein’s on microfilm, and then destroyed.[A10-153] To identify\r\nthe handwriting an enlarged photograph was made which showed the\r\nhandwriting characteristics with sufficient clarity to form the\r\nbasis of an identification.[A10-154] Based on a comparison with the\r\nstandards, the handwriting on the purchase order and the envelope\r\nwere identified as Lee Harvey Oswald’s.[A10-155] The money order,\r\nwhich was retained by the post office after having been cashed\r\nby Klein’s,[A10-156] was also identified as being in Oswald’s\r\nhandwriting.[A10-157] These identifications were made on the basis\r\nof numerous characteristics in which the writing in both the\r\nquestioned and standard documents departed from conventional letter\r\nforms.[A10-158] For example, in the return address on the envelope, the\r\nleft side of the “A” in “A. Hidell” was made by a downstroke followed\r\nby an upstroke which almost exactly traced the down-stroke, the “i”\r\nshowed an elongation of the approach stroke and an exaggerated slant to\r\nthe right, and the second “l” was somewhat larger than the first; the\r\n“B” in “Box” had an upper lobe smaller than the lower lobe; the “D” in\r\n“Dallas” exhibited a distinctive construction of the looped form at the\r\ntop of a letter, and the “s” was flattened and forced over on its side;\r\nand the “x” in “Texas” was made in the form of a “u” with a cross bar.\r\nThese characteristics were also present in the standards.[A10-159] In\r\naddition, these items, as well as other questioned documents, resembled\r\nthe standards in their use of certain erroneous combinations of capital\r\nand lowercase letters.[A10-160] For example, in the mail order, “Texas”\r\nwas printed with a capital “T,” “X,” “A,” and “S,” but a lowercase “e”;\r\na similar mixture of capital and lowercase letters in “Texas” was found\r\nin the standards.[A10-161]\r\n\r\nThe writing on the purchase order and envelope showed no significant\r\nevidence of disguise (subject to the qualification that the use of hand\r\nprinting on the mail order, rather than handwriting, may have been used\r\nfor that purpose).[A10-162] However, it is not unusual for a person\r\nusing an alias not to disguise his writing. For example, Cole, who is\r\ndocument examiner for the Treasury Department, has frequently examined\r\nforgeries evidencing no attempt at disguise. [A10-163]\r\n\r\n\r\nMail Order for the V510210 Revolver\r\n\r\nBased on a comparison with the standards, the handwriting on the mail\r\norder[A10-164] for the V510210 revolver was also identified as Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald’s.[A10-165]\r\n\r\n\r\nPost Office Box Applications and Change-of-Address Card\r\n\r\nA post office box application consists of three parts: The first\r\ncontains directions for use. The second provides applicant’s name,\r\naddress, signature space, box number, date of opening and closing. The\r\nthird part provides instruction space concerning delivery of mail and\r\nnames of persons entitled to use the box.[A10-166] Under post office\r\nregulations[A10-167] the second part was retained by the Dallas Post\r\nOffice for box 2915; it destroyed the third part after the box was\r\nclosed. Based on the standards, the signature “Lee H. Oswald,” and\r\nother handwriting on the application, was identified as that of Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald.[A10-168] The postal clerk appeared to have filled in the\r\nbalance.[A10-169]\r\n\r\nThe Fort Worth and Dallas post offices retained two change-of-address\r\norders signed “Lee H. Oswald”: One to “Postmaster, Fort Worth, Tex.,”\r\ndated October 10, 1962, to send mail to “Oswald, Lee H” at 2703\r\nMercedes Av., Fort Worth, Texas” and forward to “Box 2915, Dallas,\r\nTexas”; the other to “Postmaster, Dallas, Texas” dated May 12, 1963,\r\nrequested mail for post office box 2915 be forwarded to “Lee Oswald” at\r\n“4907 Magazine St., New Orleans, La.”[A10-170] Based on a comparison\r\nwith the standards, the handwriting on these orders was identified as\r\nthat of Lee Harvey Oswald.[A10-171]\r\n\r\nThe New Orleans post office retained the third part of the application\r\nfor post office box 30061, New Orleans, La., dated June 11, 1963, and\r\nsigned “L. H. Oswald.” [A10-172] Inserted in the space for names of\r\npersons entitled to receive mail through the box were written the names\r\n“A. J. Hidell” and “Marina Oswald.” On the basis of a comparison with\r\nthe standards, the writing and the signature on the card was identified\r\nas the handwriting of Lee Harvey Oswald.[A10-173]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spurious Selective Service System Notice of Classification and U.S.\r\nMarine Corps Certificate of Service\r\n\r\nWhen Oswald was arrested he had in his possession a Selective\r\nService System notice of classification and a certificate of service\r\nin the U.S. Marine Corps in the name of “Alek James Hidell,” and\r\na Selective Service System notice of classification, a Selective\r\nService System registration certificate, and a certificate of service\r\nin the U.S. Marine Corps in his own name.[A10-174] (See Cadigan\r\nExhibits Nos. 19 and 21, p. 573.) The Hidell cards where photographic\r\ncounterfeits.[A10-175] After Oswald’s arrest a group of retouched\r\nnegatives were found in Mr. Paine’s garage at 2515 West Fifth Street,\r\nIrving, Tex.,[A10-176] among which were retouched negatives of the\r\nOswald cards.[A10-177] A comparison of these retouched negatives\r\nwith the Hidell and Oswald cards showed that the Hidell cards had\r\nbeen counterfeited by photographing the Oswald cards, retouching\r\nthe resulting negatives, and producing photographic prints from the\r\nretouched negatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hidell Notice of Classification\r\n\r\n_Face side._--The face of the Hidell notice of classification[A10-178]\r\nwas produced from the face of the Oswald notice of\r\nclassification[A10-179] by a two-step process. First, the counterfeiter\r\nphotographed the Oswald notice, making a basic intermediate\r\nnegative.[A10-180] He then opaqued out of this intermediate negative\r\nall of the information typed or handwritten onto the Oswald notice,\r\nincluding the name “Lee Harvey Oswald,” the selective service No.,\r\n“41-114-39-532,” the signature of the official of the local board, and\r\nthe mailing date. In addition, he made another intermediate negative\r\nof the lowermost third of the Oswald notice, which contained a printed\r\nlegend setting forth various instructions relating to draft board\r\nprocedures.[A10-181] This negative reproduced the printed material\r\nexactly, but reduced it in size.[A10-182] The two intermediate\r\nnegatives were combined to produce a third negative, substantially\r\nidentical to the basic intermediate negative except that, by virtue of\r\nthe reduction in the size of the printed legend, a square space had\r\nbeen created in the lower left-hand corner.[A10-183] The counterfeiter\r\nthen made a photographic print of this third negative, which contained\r\nblanks wherever typed or handwritten material had appeared on the\r\noriginal Oswald notice and a new space in the lower left-hand corner.\r\nFinally, new material was inserted into the blanks on the Hidell\r\nnotice where typed or handwritten material had appeared on the Oswald\r\nnotice.[A10-184] Thus the name “ALEK JAMES HIDELL,” the selective\r\nservice No. “42-224-39-532,” and the mailing date “Feb. 5, 1962,”\r\nwere typed into the appropriate blanks on the Hidell notice. Two\r\ntypewriters were used in this typing, as shown by differences in the\r\ndesign of the typed figure “4,”[A10-185] and by differences in the\r\nstrength of the typed impression.[A10-186] Probably the counterfeiter\r\nswitched typewriters when he discovered that the ribbon of his first\r\ntypewriter was not inked heavily enough to leave a clear impression (a\r\nproblem which would have been aggravated by the fact that the glossy\r\nphotographic paper used to make the Hidell notice did not provide a\r\ngood surface for typewriting).[A10-187] The face of the notice also\r\nbore many uninked indentations, which could only be made out under\r\nstrong side lighting.[A10-188] These indentations were apparently\r\nmade with the typewriter set at stencil--that is, set so that the\r\ntypewriter key struck the notice directly, rather than striking it\r\nthrough the inked typewriter ribbon.[A10-189] This may have been done\r\nas a dry-run practice, to enable the counterfeiter to determine how to\r\nproperly center and aline the inserted material.[A10-190] A sidelight\r\nphotograph showed that the names “ALEK,” “JAMES,” and “HIDELL” had\r\neach been typed in stencil at least twice before being typed in with\r\nthe ribbon.[A10-191] A capital letter “O” had been stenciled prior to\r\none of the stenciled “ALEK’s.”[A10-192] A serial number and a date of\r\nmailing had also been typed in stencil.[A10-193]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the typed material, a signature, “Alek J. Hidell,” was\r\nwritten in ink in the blank provided for the registrant’s signature,\r\nand another, somewhat illegible signature, apparently reading “Good\r\nHoffer,” was written in ink in the blank provided for the signature\r\nof an official of the local board.[A10-194] This name differed from\r\nthe name written in ink on the Oswald notice, which appeared to\r\nconsist of a first name beginning with an “E” or a “G” and the surname\r\n“Schiffen.”[A10-195] However, the legibility of the name on the Oswald\r\nnotice was also quite poor, and the counterfeiter might have been\r\nattempting to duplicate it. A possible reason for deleting the original\r\nname and substituting another is that if the name had not been deleted\r\nit would have been reproduced on the Hidell notice as a photographic\r\nreproduction, which would look less authentic than a pen-and-ink\r\nsignature.[A10-196]\r\n\r\nBased on a comparison with the handwriting in the standards, the\r\nsignature “Alek J. Hidell” on the Hidell notice was identified as being\r\nin the handwriting of Lee Harvey Oswald.[A10-197] The signature “Good\r\nHoffer” could not be positively identified, being almost illegible;\r\nhowever, it was not inconsistent with Oswald’s handwriting.[A10-198]\r\n\r\nTo complete the face of the Hidell notice a picture of Lee Harvey\r\nOswald was inserted into the space in the lower left-hand corner which\r\nhad been created by reducing the size of the printed legend at the\r\nbottom.[A10-199]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CADIGAN EXHIBIT NO. 19\r\n\r\nFace and reverse sides of the Oswald Notice of Classification.\r\n\r\n\r\nCADIGAN EXHIBIT NO. 21\r\n\r\nFace and reverse sides of the Oswald Selective Service System\r\nRegistration Certificate and the Oswald Certificate of Service in the\r\nU.S. Marine Corps.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CADIGAN EXHIBITS NOS. 15 AND 16\r\n\r\nFace and reverse sides of the Hidell Selective Service System Notice of\r\nClassification.\r\n\r\nFace and reverse sides of the Hidell Certificate of Service in the U.S.\r\nMarine Corps.]\r\n\r\nIn creating the face of the Hidell notice, the counterfeiter left\r\ntraces which enabled the experts to link together the Hidell notice,\r\nthe retouched negatives, and the Oswald notice. To retouch the\r\nnegatives the counterfeiter simply painted a red opaque substance on\r\none side of the negative over the material he wished to delete. When\r\nthe negative was printed, the opaquing prevented light from passing\r\nthrough, so that the print showed blanks wherever the negative had been\r\nopaqued. However, the original material was still clearly visible on\r\nthe negative itself.[A10-200] In addition, at several points the typed\r\nor handwritten material in the Oswald notice had overlapped the printed\r\nmaterial. For example, the signature of the official of the local\r\nboard overlapped the letters “re” in the printed word “President,”\r\n“l” and “a” in the printed word “local,” and “viola” in the printed\r\nword “violation.” When this signature was opaqued out, the portions of\r\nthe printed material which had been overlapped by the signature were\r\neither removed or mutilated. The consequent distortions were apparent\r\non both the retouched negative and the Hidell notice itself. Similarly,\r\nthe selective service number typed on the Oswald notice overlapped\r\nthe margins of the boxes into which it was typed. Although the\r\ncounterfeiter opaqued out the numerals themselves, the margins of the\r\nboxes remained thickened at the points where they had been overlapped\r\nby the numerals. These thickened margins were apparent on both the\r\nretouched negative and the Hidell notice.[A10-201]\r\n\r\n_Reverse side._--The reverse side of the Hidell notice, which was\r\npasted back-to-back to the face, was actually a form of the reverse\r\nside of a Selective Service System registration certificate.\r\nEssentially, it was counterfeited the same way as the face of the\r\nnotice: a photograph was made of the reverse side of the Oswald\r\nregistration certificate, the material which had been typed or stamped\r\non the Oswald registration certificate was opaqued out of the resulting\r\nnegative, and a photographic print was made from the retouched\r\nnegative. This is shown by the negative, in which the opaqued-out\r\ninformation is still visible, and by defects in the printed material\r\non the Hidell notice at point where typed-in material had overlapped\r\nprinted material on the Oswald registration certificate.[A10-202]\r\n\r\nAs the final step, new information was typed on the print in the blanks\r\nwhich resulted from the retouching operation.[A10-203] Thus “GR” was\r\nsubstituted for “Blue” under color of eyes; “BROWN” was substituted\r\nfor “Brn” under color of hair; “FAIR” was substituted for “Med.” under\r\ncomplexion; “5” [ft.] “9” [in.] was substituted for “5” [ft.] “11”\r\n[in.] under height; and “155” was substituted for “150” under weight.\r\nThe name and address of the local board on the Oswald registration\r\ncertificate were opaqued out, but substantially the same name and\r\naddress were typed back onto the Hidell notice.[A10-204] As in the\r\nsignature of the local board official on the face of the notice, a\r\npossible reason for deleting the original draft board name and the\r\naddress and substituting substantially similar material in its place\r\nis that if the original material had not been deleted it would have\r\nreproduced as a photographic reproduction, which would look much less\r\nauthentic than typed-in material.[A10-205]\r\n\r\nA limited number of typed uninked indentations are also present.\r\nThus the indented letters “CT” appear before the letters “GR” (under\r\ncolor of eyes) and the indented letters “EY” follow “GR.” An indented\r\n“9” appears above the visible “9” for the inch figure of height, and\r\nan indented “i” appears before the weight, “155.” Much of the typed\r\nmaterial on the reverse side of the Hidell notice was not very legible\r\nunder ordinary lighting, since it was typed with a typewriter which\r\nleft a very weakly inked impression.[A10-206] In fact, it is difficult\r\nto tell whether some of the material, particularly the word “Brown”\r\nunder color of hair, was put in by stencil or by ribbon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hidell Certificate of Service\r\n\r\nThe face and reverse side of the Hidell certificate of service were\r\nproduced from the face and reverse side of the Oswald certificate of\r\nservice[A10-207] by photographing the Oswald certificate, retouching\r\nthe resulting negatives to eliminate typed and handwritten material,\r\nand making a photographic print from the retouched negative.[A10-208]\r\nAs in the case of the notice of classification, this is shown by the\r\nnegative itself, in which the opaqued-out information is still visible,\r\nand by defects in the printed material on the Hidell certificate at\r\npoints where handwritten material had crossed over printed material\r\non the Oswald certificate. Thus, in the Oswald certificate the upper\r\nportion of the name “Lee” in Oswald’s signature crosses the letter\r\n“u” in the printed word “signature.” The consequent mutilation of the\r\nprinted letter “u” can be seen on the Hidell certificate. Similarly,\r\nthe ending stroke in the letter “y” in the name “Harvey” in Oswald’s\r\nsignature crosses the letter “n” in the printed word “certifying.”\r\nThis stroke was not removed at all, and can be seen as a stroke\r\nacross the “n” in the Hidell certificate.[A10-209] As the final step\r\nin producing the Hidell certificate, new material was typed into the\r\nblanks on the photographic print. On the face, the words “ALEK JAMES\r\nHIDELL” were typed into the blank where “LEE HARVEY OSWALD 1653230”\r\nhad appeared. A sidelight photograph shows that these words had been\r\ntyped in stencil at least twice before being typed in with the ribbon\r\napparently to determine proper centering and alignment.[A10-210] In\r\nproducing the reverse side of the Hidell certificate, the signature\r\n“Lee Harvey Oswald,” and the dates “24 October 1956” and “11 September\r\n1959,” showing the beginning and end of the period of active service,\r\nhad been opaqued out. No signature was inserted into resulting blank\r\nsignature space. However, just below the word “of” in the printed line\r\n“signature of individual,” there are two vertical indentations which\r\nfill about three-fourths of the height of the signature blank, and a\r\ndiagonal indentation which slants from approximately the base of the\r\nleft vertical to approximately the midpoint of the right vertical--the\r\ntotal effect being of a printed capital letter “H.” Also, just below\r\nthe second and third “i’s” in the printed word “individual” are two\r\nmore vertical indentations, which could be the vertical strokes of\r\n“d’s” or “l’s”--although the circular portion of the letter “d” is\r\nnot present.[A10-211] These indentations could have been made by any\r\nsharp instrument, such as a ballpoint pen which was not delivering ink,\r\na stylus of the type used in preparing mimeograph forms, or even a\r\ntoothpick.[A10-212] The indentations are brought out rather clearly in\r\na sidelight photograph, but can also be seen on the card itself if the\r\ncard is held so that light strikes it at an angle.[A10-213]\r\n\r\nInto the space for the beginning of active service was typed the date\r\n“OCT. 13 1958.” The space for the end of active service contains\r\nseveral light-impression and stencil typewriting operations. It\r\nwas apparently intended to read “OCT. 12 1961,” but because of the\r\nlightness of the impression and the many stenciled characters, the\r\ndate is barely legible.[A10-214] Interestingly, one of the stenciled\r\nimpressions in the blank for end of active service reads “24 October\r\n1959,” as determined under a microscope, while a stenciled impression\r\nin the blank for beginning of active service reads “24 October\r\n1957.”[A10-215]\r\n\r\nThe counterfeiting of the Hidell cards did not require great skill,\r\nbut probably required an elementary knowledge of photography,\r\nparticularly of the photographic techniques used in a printing\r\nplant.[A10-216] A moderate amount of practice with the technique would\r\nbe required--perhaps half a dozen attempts. Practicing retouching on\r\nthe balance of the negatives found at the Paine garage would have been\r\nsufficient.[A10-217] The retouching of the negatives could have been\r\naccomplished without any special equipment. However, the preparation\r\nof the negative, apart from retouching, would probably have required\r\na very accurate camera, such as would be found in a photographic\r\nlaboratory or printing plant.[A10-218]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vaccination Certificate\r\n\r\nA government-printed form entitled “International Certificates of\r\nVaccination or Revaccination against Smallpox”[A10-219] was found\r\namong Oswald’s belongings at his room at 1026 Beckley Avenue,\r\nDallas.[A10-220] The form purported to certify that “LEE OSWALD” had\r\nbeen vaccinated against smallpox on “JUNE 8, 1963” by “DR. A.J. HIDEEL,\r\nP.O. BOX 30016, NEW ORLEANS, LA.” The card was signed “Lee H. Oswald”\r\nand “A. J. Hideel,” and the name and address “Lee H. Oswald, New\r\nOrleans, La.” were hand printed on the front of the card. All of this\r\nmaterial, except the signatures and the hand printing, had been stamped\r\nonto the card. The Hideel name and address consisted of a three-line\r\nstamp--“DR. A. J. HIDEEL/P.O. BOX 30016/NEW ORLEANS, LA.” A circular,\r\nstamped, illegible impression resembling a seal appeared under a\r\ncolumn entitled “Approved stamp.”[A10-221]\r\n\r\nOn the basis of a comparison with the standards, Cole identified all of\r\nthe handwriting on the vaccination certificate, including the signature\r\n“A. J. Hideel,” as the writing of Lee Harvey Oswald.[A10-222] Cadigan\r\nidentified all of the writing as Oswald’s except for the “A. J. Hideel”\r\nsignature, which in his opinion was too distorted to either identify\r\nor nonidentify as Oswald’s handwriting.[A10-223] The stamped material\r\non the certificate was compared with a rubber stamping kit which\r\nbelonged to Oswald.[A10-224] In this kit was a rubber stamp with three\r\nlines of print assembled: “L. H. OSWALD/4907 MAGAZINE ST/NEW ORLEANS,\r\nLA.”[A10-225] Cole found a perfect agreement in measurement and design\r\nbetween the letters stamped on the certificate and the letters he\r\nexamined from Oswald’s rubber stamping kit. However, he was unable\r\nto determine whether the characteristics of Oswald’s rubber stamping\r\nkit were distinctive, and therefore, while he concluded that Oswald’s\r\nrubber stamping kit could have made the rubber stamp impressions on the\r\ncertificate, he was unable to say that it was the only kit which could\r\nhave made the impressions.[A10-226] On the basis of the comparison\r\nbetween the words “NEW ORLEANS, LA.” set up in the rubber stamp in\r\nOswald’s kit, and the words “NEW ORLEANS, LA.” on the certificate,\r\nCadigan concluded that these words had been stamped on the certificate\r\nwith Oswald’s rubber stamp. However, he could draw no conclusion as to\r\nthe remaining stamped material, which was not directly comparable to\r\nthe remaining lines set up on Oswald’s rubber stamp.[A10-227]\r\n\r\nOn close examination, the circular impression resembling a seal\r\nconsisted of the words “BRUSH IN CAN,” printed in reverse.[A10-228]\r\nApparently, the impression was made with the top of a container of\r\nsolvent or cleaning fluid which bore these words in raised lettering.\r\nIn the center of the impression was a mottled pattern which was similar\r\nto the blank areas on a date stamp found in Oswald’s rubber stamping\r\nkit.[A10-229]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fair Play for Cuba Committee Card\r\n\r\nThe Fair Play for Cuba Committee card had two signatures: “L. H.\r\nOswald” and “A. J. Hidell.” Based on the standards, both Cole and\r\nCadigan identified “L. H. Oswald” as the signature of Lee Harvey\r\nOswald,[A10-230] but both were unable to identify the “A. J. Hidell”\r\nsignature.[A10-231] Cadigan noted differences between the Hidell\r\nsignature and Oswald’s handwriting, indicating the possibility that\r\nsomeone other than Oswald had authored the signature.[A10-232] Cole\r\nbelieved that the signature was somewhat beyond Oswald’s abilities\r\nas a penman.[A10-233] On the basis of a short English interlinear\r\ntranslation written by Marina Oswald, Cole felt that she might have\r\nbeen the author of the signature,[A10-234] but the translation did\r\nnot present enough of her handwriting to make possible a positive\r\nidentification.[A10-235] In subsequent testimony before the\r\nCommission, Marina stated that she was indeed the author of the Hidell\r\nsignature on the card.[A10-236] Cadigan confirmed this testimony by\r\nobtaining further samples of Marina Oswald’s handwriting and comparing\r\nthese samples with the signature on the card.[A10-237]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unsigned Russian-Language Note\r\n\r\nCadigan’s examination confirmed Marina’s testimony that the handwriting\r\nin the unsigned note, Commission Exhibit No. 1, was that of Lee Harvey\r\nOswald.[A10-238] Since the note was written almost entirely in the\r\nRussian language, which uses the Cyrillic alphabet (as opposed to the\r\nLatin alphabet used in the English language), in making his examination\r\nCadigan employed not only Oswald’s English language standards, but also\r\nletters written by Oswald in the Russian language.[A10-239]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Homemade Wrapping Paper Bag\r\n\r\nIn the absence of watermarks or other distinctive characteristics,\r\nit is impossible to determine whether two samples of paper came from\r\nthe same manufacturer.[A10-240] The homemade paper bag found on\r\nthe sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository following the\r\nassassination was made out of heavy brown paper and glue-bearing\r\nbrown paper tape, neither of which contained watermarks or other\r\ndistinctive characteristics.[A10-241] However, Cadigan compared the\r\nquestioned paper and tape in the paper bag with known paper and tape\r\nsamples obtained from the shipping department of the Texas School Book\r\nDepository on November 22, 1963, to see if the questioned items could\r\nhave come from the shipping room.[A10-242] The questioned and known\r\nitems were examined visually by normal, incidental, and transmitted\r\nnatural and electric light, and under ultraviolet light;[A10-243]\r\nexamined microscopically for surface, paper structure, color, and\r\nimperfections;[A10-244] examined for their felting pattern, which\r\nis the pattern of light and dark areas caused by the manner in\r\nwhich the fibers become felted at the beginning stages of paper\r\nmanufacture;[A10-245] measured for thickness with a micrometer\r\nsensitive to one one-thousandth of an inch,[A10-246] subjected to a\r\nfiber analysis to determine the type of fibers of which they were\r\ncomposed, and whether the fibers were bleached or unbleached;[A10-247]\r\nand examined spectrographically to determine what metallic ions were\r\npresent.[A10-248] The questioned and known items were identical in all\r\nthe properties measured by these tests.[A10-249] (The width of the tape\r\non the paper sack was 3 inches, while the width of the sample tape\r\nwas 2.975, or twenty-five thousandths of an inch smaller; however,\r\nthis was not a significant difference).[A10-250] In contrast, a paper\r\nsample obtained from the Texas School Book Depository shipping room\r\non December 1, 1963, was readily distinguishable from the questioned\r\npaper.[A10-251]\r\n\r\nExamination of the tape revealed other significant factors indicating\r\nthat it could have come from the Texas School Book Depository shipping\r\nroom. There were several strips of tape on the bag.[A10-252] All but\r\ntwo of the ends of these strips were irregularly torn; the remaining\r\ntwo ends had machine-cut edges. This indicated that the person who made\r\nthe bag had drawn a long strip of tape from a dispensing machine and\r\nhad torn it by hand into several smaller strips.[A10-253] Confirmation\r\nthat the tape had been drawn from a dispensing machine was supplied\r\nby the fact that a series of small markings in the form of half-inch\r\nlines ran down the center of the tape like ties on a railroad track.\r\nSuch lines are made by a ridged wheel in a tape dispenser which is\r\nconstructed so that when a hand lever is pulled, the wheel, which is\r\nconnected to the lever, pulls the tape from its roll and dispenses it.\r\nSuch dispensers are usually found only in commercial establishments. A\r\ndispenser of this type was located in the Texas School Book Depository\r\nshipping room. The length of the lines and the number of lines per\r\ninch on the tape from the paper bag was identical to the length of the\r\nlines and the number of lines per inch on the tape obtained from the\r\ndispenser in the Texas School Book Depository shipping room.[A10-254]\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUND BALLISTICS EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\nPurpose of the Tests\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the Commission’s inquiry, questions arose as\r\nto whether the wounds inflicted on President Kennedy and Governor\r\nConnally could have been caused by the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle found\r\non the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building and\r\nWestern Cartridge Co. bullets and fragments of the type found on the\r\nGovernor’s stretcher and in the Presidential limousine. In analyzing\r\nthe trajectory of the bullets after they struck their victims, further\r\nquestions were posed on the bullet’s velocity and penetration power\r\nafter exiting from the person who was initially struck. To answer\r\nthese and related questions, the Commission requested that a series of\r\ntests be conducted on substances resembling the wounded portions of\r\nthe bodies of President Kennedy and Governor Connally under conditions\r\nwhich simulated the events of the assassination.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Testers and Their Qualifications\r\n\r\nIn response to the Commission’s request, an extensive series of\r\ntests were conducted by the Wound Ballistics Branch of the U.S. Army\r\nChemical Research and Development Laboratories at Edgewood Arsenal,\r\nMd. Scientists working at that branch are engaged in full-time efforts\r\nto investigate the wound ballistics of missiles in order to test their\r\neffects on substances which simulate live human bodies.[A10-255] The\r\ntests for the Commission were performed by Dr. Alfred G. Olivier under\r\nthe general supervision of Dr. Arthur J. Dziemian with consultation\r\nfrom Dr. Frederick W. Light, Jr.[A10-256] Dr. Olivier received his\r\ndoctorate in veterinary medicine from the University of Pennsylvania in\r\n1953. Since 1957 he has been engaged in research on wound ballistics\r\nat Edgewood Arsenal and is now chief of the Wound Ballistics\r\nBranch.[A10-257] His supervisor, Dr. Dziemian, who is chief of the\r\nBiophysics Division at Edgewood Arsenal, holds a Ph. D. degree from\r\nPrinceton in 1939, was a national research fellow in physiology at\r\nthe University of Pennsylvania and was a fellow in anatomy at Johns\r\nHopkins University Medical School.[A10-258] Since 1947, Dr. Dziemian\r\nhas been continuously engaged in wound ballistics work at Edgewood\r\nArsenal.[A10-259] In 1930, Dr. Light was awarded an M.D. degree from\r\nJohns Hopkins Medical School and in 1948 received his Ph. D. from the\r\nsame institution.[A10-260] After serving a residency in pathology, he\r\nworked as a pathologist until 1940 when he returned to Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity to study mathematics. Since 1951, Dr. Light has been engaged\r\nin the study of the pathology of wounding at Edgewood Arsenal.[A10-261]\r\nAll three of these distinquished scientists testified before the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Testing Conditions\r\n\r\nThe Commission made available to the Edgewood Arsenal scientists\r\nall the relevant facts relating to the wounds which were inflicted\r\non President Kennedy and Governor Connally including the autopsy\r\nreport on the President, and the reports and X-rays from Parkland\r\nHospital.[A10-262] In addition, Drs. Olivier and Light had an\r\nopportunity to discuss in detail the Governor’s wounds with\r\nthe Governor’s surgeons, Drs. Robert R. Shaw and Charles F.\r\nGregory.[A10-263] The Zapruder films of the assassination were viewed\r\nwith Governor and Mrs. Connally to give the Edgewood scientists their\r\nversion.[A10-264] The Commission also provided the Edgewood scientists\r\nwith all known data on the source of the shots, the rifle and bullets\r\nused, and the distances involved. For purposes of the experiments, the\r\nCommission turned over to the Edgewood testers the Mannlicher-Carcano\r\nrifle found on the sixth floor of the Depository Building.[A10-265]\r\nFrom information provided by the Commission, the Edgewood scientists\r\nobtained Western bullets of the type used by the assassin.[A10-266]\r\n\r\n\r\nTests on Penetration Power and Bullet Stability\r\n\r\nComparisons were made of the penetrating power of Western bullets\r\nfired from the assassination rifle with other bullets.[A10-267] From\r\nthe Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, the Western bullet was fired through\r\ntwo gelatin blocks totaling 72½ centimeters in length.[A10-268] As\r\nevidenced by Commission Exhibit No. 844, which is a photograph from a\r\nhigh-speed motion picture, the Western bullets passed through 1½ blocks\r\nin a straight line before their trajectory curved.[A10-269] After\r\ncoming out of the second gelatin block, a number of the bullets buried\r\nthemselves in a mound of earth.[A10-270]\r\n\r\nUnder similar circumstances, a bullet described as the NATO round M-80\r\nwas fired from a M-14 rifle.[A10-271] The penetrating power of the\r\nlatter is depicted in Commission Exhibit No. 845 which shows that\r\nbullet possesses much less penetrating power with a quicker tumbling\r\naction. Those characteristics cause an early release of energy which\r\nbrings the bullet to a stop at shorter distances.[A10-272] A further\r\ntest was made with a 257 Winchester Roberts soft-nosed hunting bullet\r\nas depicted in Commission Exhibit No. 846. That bullet became deformed\r\nalmost immediately upon entering the block of gelatin and released its\r\nenergy very rapidly.[A10-273] From these tests, it was concluded that\r\nthe Western bullet fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano had “terrific\r\npenetrating ability” and would retain substantial velocity after\r\npassing through objects such as the portions of the human body.[A10-274]\r\n\r\n\r\nTests Simulating President Kennedy’s Neck Wound\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the autopsy report on President Kennedy, the Edgewood\r\nscientists simulated the portion of the President’s neck through which\r\nthe bullet passed. It was determined that the bullet traveled through\r\n13½ to 14½ centimeters of tissue in the President’s neck.[A10-275]\r\nThat substance was simulated by constructing three blocks: one with a\r\n20-percent gelatin composition, a second from one animal meat and a\r\nthird from another animal meat.[A10-276] Those substances duplicated as\r\nclosely as possible the portion of the President’s neck through which\r\nthe bullet passed.[A10-277] At the time the tests were conducted, it\r\nwas estimated that the President was struck at a range of approximately\r\n180 feet, and the onsite tests which were conducted later at Dallas\r\nestablished that the President was shot through the neck at a range\r\nof 174.9 feet to 190.8 feet.[A10-278] At a range of 180 feet, the\r\nWestern bullets were fired from the assassination weapon, which has a\r\nmuzzle velocity of approximately 2,160 feet per second, through those\r\nsubstances which were placed beside a break-type screen for measuring\r\nvelocity.[A10-279] The average entrance velocity at 180 feet was 1,904\r\nfeet per second.[A10-280]\r\n\r\nTo reconstruct the assassination situation as closely as possible both\r\nsides of the substances were covered with material and clipped animal\r\nskin to duplicate human skin.[A10-281] The average exit velocity was\r\n1,779 feet from the gelatin, 1,798 feet from the first animal meat and\r\n1,772 feet from the second animal meat.[A10-282] Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 847 depicts one of the animal meats compressed to 13½ to 14½\r\ncentimeters to approximate the President’s neck and Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 848 shows the analogous arrangement for the gelatin.[A10-283]\r\nThe photograph marked Commission Exhibit No. 849 shows the bullet\r\npassing through the gelatin in a straight line evidencing very stable\r\ncharacteristics.[A10-284]\r\n\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 850 depicts the pieces of clipped animal\r\nskin placed on the points of entry and exit showing that the holes\r\nof entrance are round while the holes of exit are “a little more\r\nelongated.”[A10-285] From these tests, it was concluded that the bullet\r\nlost little of its velocity in penetrating the President’s neck so\r\nthat there would have been substantial impact on the interior of the\r\nPresidential limousine or anyone else struck by the exiting bullet.\r\nIn addition, these tests indicated that the bullet had retained most\r\nof its stability in penetrating the President’s neck so that the exit\r\nhole would be only slightly different from the appearance of the entry\r\nhole.[A10-286]\r\n\r\n\r\nTests Simulating Governor Connally’s Chest Wounds\r\n\r\nTo most closely approximate the Governor’s chest injuries, the Edgewood\r\nscientists shot an animal with the assassination weapon using the\r\nWestern bullets at a distance of 210 feet.[A10-287] The onsite tests\r\nlater determined that the Governor was wounded at a distance of 176.9\r\nfeet to 190.8 feet from the sixth-floor window at the southeast corner\r\nof the Depository Building.[A10-288] The average striking velocity of\r\n11 shots at 210 feet was 1,929 feet per second and the average exit\r\nvelocity was 1,664 feet per second.[A10-289]\r\n\r\nOne of the shots produced an injury on the animal’s rib very similar\r\nto that inflicted on Governor Connally.[A10-290] For purposes of\r\ncomparison with the Governor’s wound, the Edgewood scientists studied\r\nthe Parkland Hospital report and X-rays, and they also discussed\r\nthese wounds with Dr. Shaw, the Governor’s chest surgeon.[A10-291]\r\nThe similar animal injury passed along the animal’s eighth left rib\r\ncausing a fracture which removed a portion of the rib in a manner very\r\nsimilar to the wound sustained by the Governor.[A10-292] The X-ray\r\nof that wound on the animal is reproduced as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n852.[A10-293] A comparison with the Governor’s chest wound, shown\r\nin X-ray marked as Commission Exhibit No. 681, shows the remarkable\r\nsimilarity between those two wounds.[A10-294]\r\n\r\nThe bullet which produced the wound depicted in Commission Exhibits\r\nNos. 851 and 852 was marked as Commission Exhibit No. 853 and possessed\r\ncharacteristics very similar to the bullet marked as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 399 found on Governor Connally’s stretcher and believed\r\nto have been the bullet which caused his chest wound.[A10-295] Those\r\nbullets, identified as Commission Exhibits Nos. 399 and 853, were\r\nflattened in similar fashion.[A10-296] In addition, the lead core was\r\nextruded from the rear in the same fashion on both bullets.[A10-297]\r\nOne noticeable difference was that the bullet identified as Commission\r\nExhibit No. 853, which penetrated the animal, was somewhat more flat\r\nthan Commission Exhibit No. 399 which indicated that Commission\r\nExhibit No. 853 was probably traveling at somewhat greater speed than\r\nthe bullet which penetrated the Governor’s chest.[A10-298] After the\r\nbullet passed through the animal, it left an imprint on the velocity\r\nscreen immediately behind the animal which was almost the length of\r\nthe bullet indicating that the bullet was traveling sideways or end\r\nover end.[A10-299] Taking into consideration the extra girth on the\r\nGovernor, the reduction in the velocity of the bullet passing through\r\nhis body was estimated at 400 feet.[A10-300] The conclusions from\r\nthe animal shots are significant when taken in conjunction with the\r\nexperiments performed simulating the injuries to the Governor’s wrist.\r\n\r\n\r\nTests Simulating Governor Connally’s Wrist Wounds\r\n\r\nFollowing procedures identical to those employed in simulating the\r\nchest wound, the wound ballistics experts from Edgewood Arsenal\r\nreproduced, as closely as possible, the Governor’s wrist wound. Again\r\nthe scientists examined the reports and X-rays from Parkland Hospital\r\nand discussed the Governor’s wrist wound with the attending orthopedic\r\nsurgeon, Dr. Charles F. Gregory.[A10-301] Bone structures were then\r\nshot with Western bullets fired from the assassination weapon at a\r\ndistance of 210 feet.[A10-302] The most similar bone-structure shot was\r\nanalyzed in testimony before the Commission. An X-ray designated as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 854 and a photograph of that X-ray which appears\r\nas Commission Exhibit No. 855 show a fracture at a location which is\r\nvery similar to the Governor’s wrist wound depicted in X-rays marked as\r\nCommission Exhibits Nos. 690 and 691.[A10-303]\r\n\r\nThe average striking velocity of the shots was 1,858 feet per\r\nsecond.[A10-304] The average exit velocity was 1,786 feet per second\r\nfor the 7 out of 10 shots from bone structures which could be\r\nmeasured.[A10-305] These tests demonstrated that Governor Connally’s\r\nwrist was not struck by a pristine bullet, which is a missile that\r\nstrikes an object before hitting anything else.[A10-306] This\r\nconclusion was based on the following factors: (1) Greater damage\r\nwas inflicted on the bone structure than that which was suffered\r\nby the Governor’s wrist;[A10-307] and (2) the bone structure had a\r\nsmaller entry wound and a larger exit wound which is characteristic\r\nof a pristine bullet as distinguished from the Governor’s wrist which\r\nhad a larger wound of entry indicating a bullet which was tumbling\r\nwith substantial reduction in velocity.[A10-308] In addition, if the\r\nbullet found on the Governor’s stretcher (Commission Exhibit No. 399)\r\ninflicted the wound on the Governor’s wrist, then it could not have\r\npassed through the Governor’s wrist had it been a pristine bullet, for\r\nthe nose would have been considerably flattened, as was the bullet\r\nwhich struck the bone structure, identified as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n856.[A10-309]\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions From Simulating the Neck, Chest, and Wrist Wounds\r\n\r\nBoth Drs. Olivier and Dziemian expressed the opinion that one bullet\r\ncaused all the wounds on Governor Connally.[A10-310] The wound to the\r\nGovernor’s wrist was explained by circumstances where the bullet passed\r\nthrough the Governor’s chest, lost substantial velocity in doing so,\r\ntumbled through the wrist, and then slightly penetrated the Governor’s\r\nleft thigh.[A10-311] Thus, the results of the wound ballistics tests\r\nsupport the conclusions of Governor Connally’s doctors that all his\r\nwounds were caused by one bullet.[A10-312]\r\n\r\nIn addition, the wound ballistics tests indicated that it was most\r\nprobable that the same bullet passed through the President’s neck\r\nand then proceeded to inflict all the wounds on the Governor. That\r\nconclusion was reached by Drs. Olivier and Dziemian based on the\r\nmedical evidence on the wounds of the President and the Governor and\r\nthe tests they performed.[A10-313] It was their opinion that the wound\r\non the Governor’s wrist would have been more extensive had the bullet\r\nwhich inflicted that injury merely passed through the Governor’s chest\r\nexiting at a velocity of approximately 1,500 feet per second. Thus,\r\nthe Governor’s wrist wound indicated that the bullet passed through\r\nthe President’s neck, began to yaw in the air between the President\r\nand the Governor, and then lost substantially more velocity than 400\r\nfeet per second in passing through the Governor’s chest.[A10-314] A\r\nbullet which was yawing on entering into the Governor’s back would\r\nlose substantially more velocity in passing through his body than a\r\npristine bullet.[A10-315] In addition, the greater flattening of the\r\nbullet that struck the animal’s rib (Commission Exhibit No. 853) than\r\nthe bullet which presumably struck the Governor’s rib (Commission\r\nExhibit No. 399) indicates that the animal bullet was traveling at a\r\ngreater velocity.[A10-316] That suggests that the bullet which entered\r\nthe Governor’s chest had already lost velocity by passing through the\r\nPresident’s neck.[A10-317] Moreover, the large wound on the Governor’s\r\nback would be explained by a bullet which was yawing although that type\r\nof wound might also be accounted for by a tangential striking.[A10-318]\r\n\r\nDr. Frederick W. Light, Jr., the third of the wound ballistics experts,\r\ntestified that the anatomical findings alone were insufficient for\r\nhim to formulate a firm opinion on whether the same bullet did or did\r\nnot pass through the President’s neck first before inflicting all the\r\nwounds on Governor Connally.[A10-319] Based on the other circumstances,\r\nsuch as the relative positions in the automobile of the President and\r\nthe Governor, Dr. Light concluded that it was probable that the same\r\nbullet traversed the President’s neck and inflicted all the wounds on\r\nGovernor Connally.[A10-320]\r\n\r\n\r\nTests Simulating President Kennedy’s Head Wounds\r\n\r\nAdditional tests were performed on inert skulls filled with a 20\r\npercent gelatin substance and then coated with additional gelatin to\r\napproximate the soft tissues overlying the skull.[A10-321] The skull\r\nwas then draped with simulated hair as depicted in Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 860.[A10-322] Using the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle and the Western\r\nbullets, 10 shots were fired at the reconstructed skulls from a\r\ndistance of 270 feet which was the estimated distance at the time those\r\ntests were conducted.[A10-323] It was later determined through the\r\nonsite tests that President Kennedy was struck in the back of the head\r\nat a distance of 265.3 feet from the assassination weapon.[A10-324]\r\n\r\nThe general results of these tests were illustrated by the findings on\r\none skull which was struck at a point most nearly approximating the\r\nwound of entry on President Kennedy’s head.[A10-325] The whole skull,\r\ndepicted in Commission Exhibit No. 860, was struck 2.9 centimeters\r\nto the right and almost horizontal to the occipital protuberance or\r\nslightly above it, which was virtually the precise point of entry on\r\nthe President’s head as described by the autopsy surgeons.[A10-326]\r\nThat bullet blew out the right side of the reconstructed skull in a\r\nmanner very similar to the head wounds of the President.[A10-327] The\r\nconsequences on that skull are depicted in Commission Exhibits Nos. 861\r\nand 862, which illustrate the testimony of Dr. Alfred G. Olivier, who\r\nsupervised the experiments.[A10-328] Based on his review of the autopsy\r\nreport, Dr. Olivier concluded that the damage to the reconstructed\r\nskull was very similar to the wound inflicted on the President.[A10-329]\r\n\r\nTwo fragments from the bullet which struck the test skull closely\r\nresembled the two fragments found in the front seat of the Presidential\r\nlimousine. The fragment designated as Commission Exhibit No. 567 is a\r\nmutilated piece of lead and copper very similar to a mutilated piece\r\nof copper recovered from the bullet which struck the skull depicted\r\nin Commission Exhibit No. 860. The other fragment, designated as\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 569 which was found in the front seat of the\r\nPresidential limousine, is the copper end of the bullet.[A10-330]\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 569 is very similar to a copper fragment of the\r\nend of the bullet which struck the test skull.[A10-331] The fragments\r\nfrom the test bullet are designated as Commission Exhibit No. 857 and\r\nare depicted in a photograph identified as Commission Exhibit No.\r\n858.[A10-332] A group of small lead particles, recovered from the test\r\nbullet, are also very similar to the particles recovered under the\r\nleft jump seat and in the President’s head. The particles from the\r\ntest bullet are a part of Commission Exhibit No. 857 and are depicted\r\nin photograph designated as Commission Exhibit No. 859.[A10-333] That\r\nskull was depicted as Commission Exhibit No. 862.[A10-334]\r\n\r\nAs a result of these tests, Dr. Olivier concluded that the Western\r\nbullet fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle at a distance of 270\r\nfeet would make the same type of wound found on the President’s\r\nhead.[A10-335] Prior to the tests, Dr. Olivier had some doubt that such\r\na stable bullet would cause a massive head wound like that inflicted\r\non the President.[A10-336] He had thought it more likely that such a\r\nstriking bullet would make small entrance and exit holes.[A10-337] The\r\ntests, however, showed that the bones of the skull were sufficient\r\nto deform the end of the bullet causing it to expend a great deal of\r\nenergy and thereby blow out the side of the skull.[A10-338] These tests\r\nfurther confirmed the autopsy surgeons’ opinions that the President’s\r\nhead wound was not caused by a dumdum bullet.[A10-339] Because of the\r\ntest results, Dr. Olivier concluded that the fragments found on and\r\nunder the front seat of the President’s car most probably came from\r\nthe bullet which struck the President’s head.[A10-340] It was further\r\nconcluded that the damage done to Governor Connally’s wrist could not\r\nhave resulted from a fragment from the bullet which struck President\r\nKennedy’s head.[A10-341]\r\n\r\n\r\nHAIRS AND FIBERS\r\n\r\nTestimony on hairs and fibers was given by Paul M. Stombaugh[A10-342]\r\nof the FBI. Stombaugh has been a specialist in hairs and fibers\r\nsince 1960, when he began a 1-year period of specialized training in\r\nthis field. He has made thousands of hair and fiber examinations,\r\nand has testified in Federal and State courts in approximately 28\r\nStates.[A10-343] Stombaugh examined and gave testimony on the\r\nfollowing objects: (1) The green and brown blanket found in the Paine’s\r\ngarage, Commission Exhibit No. 140; (2) the homemade paper bag found\r\non the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository following the\r\nassassination, Commission Exhibit No. 142; (3) the shirt worn by Oswald\r\non November 22, 1963, Commission Exhibit No. 150; and (4) the C2766\r\nrifle, Commission Exhibit No. 139.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 666\r\n\r\nDIAGRAM OF A HAIR]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Principles\r\n\r\n_Hairs._--As shown in Commission Exhibit No. 666 (p. 587), a hair\r\nconsists of a central shaft of air cells, known as the medulla; a\r\ncortex containing pigment granules (which give the hair its color)\r\nand cortical fusi (air spaces); and a cuticle and an outer layer of\r\nscales. Unlike fingerprints, hairs are not unique. However, human hairs\r\ncan be distinguished from animal hairs by various characteristics,\r\nincluding color, texture, length, medullary structure and shape, shape\r\nof pigment, root size, and scale size. In addition, hairs of the\r\nCaucasian, Negroid, and Mongoloid human races can be distinguished\r\nfrom each other by color, texture, size and degree of fluctuation of\r\ndiameter, thickness of cuticle, shape and distribution of pigment,\r\nand shape of cross-section. Moreover, even though individual hairs\r\nare not unique, the expert usually can distinguish the hairs of\r\ndifferent individuals. Thus, Stombaugh, who had made approximately\r\n1,000 comparison examinations of Caucasian hairs and 500 comparison\r\nexaminations of Negroid hairs, had never found a case in which he\r\nwas unable to differentiate the hairs of two different Caucasian\r\nindividuals, and had found only several cases in which he could\r\nnot distinguish, with absolute certainty, between the hairs of two\r\ndifferent Negroid individuals.[A10-344]\r\n\r\n_Fibers._--Like hairs, the various types of natural and artificial\r\nfibers can be distinguished from each other under the microscope. Like\r\nhairs too, individual fibers are not unique, but the expert usually\r\ncan distinguish fibers from different fabrics. A major identifying\r\ncharacteristic of most fibers is color, and under the microscope many\r\ndifferent shades of each color can be differentiated--for example,\r\n50-100 shades of green or blue, and 25-30 shades of black. The\r\nmicroscopic appearance of three types of fibers--cotton, wool, and\r\nviscose--is illustrated in Commission Exhibit No. 665 (p. 589). Two of\r\nthese, cotton and viscose, were the subject of testimony by Stombaugh.\r\nCotton is a natural fiber. Under the microscope, it resembles a twisted\r\nsoda straw, and the degree of twist is an additional identifying\r\ncharacteristic of cotton. Cotton may be mercerized or (more commonly)\r\nunmercerized. Viscose is an artificial fiber. A delustering agent\r\nis usually added to viscose to cut down its luster, and under the\r\nmicroscope this agent appears as millions of tiny spots on the outside\r\nof the fiber. The major identifying characteristics of viscose, apart\r\nfrom color, are diameter--hundreds of variations being possible--and\r\nsize and distribution of delustering agent, if any.[A10-345]\r\n\r\n_The blanket._--Stombaugh received the blanket, Commission Exhibit No.\r\n140, in the FBI Laboratory at 7:30 a.m., on November 23, 1963.[A10-346]\r\nExamination showed that it was composed of brown and green fibers, of\r\nwhich approximately 1-2 percent were woolen, 20-35 percent were cotton,\r\nand the remainder were delustered viscose.[A10-347] The viscose fibers\r\nin the blanket were of 10-15 different diameters, and also varied\r\nslightly in shade and in the size and distribution of the delustering\r\nagent. (The apparent cause of those variations was that the viscose\r\nin the blanket consisted of scrap viscose.)[A10-348] The cotton also\r\nvaried in shade, about seven to eight different shades of green cotton\r\nbeing present, but was uniform in twist.[A10-349]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 665\r\n\r\nTEXTILE FIBERS\r\n\r\nCOTTON\r\n\r\nWOOL\r\n\r\nVISCOSE]\r\n\r\nWhen received by Stombaugh, the blanket was folded into approximately\r\nthe shape of a narrow right triangle.[A10-350] A safety pin was\r\ninserted in one end of the blanket, and also at this end, loosely\r\nwrapped around the blanket, was a string.[A10-351] On the basis of\r\ncreases in the blanket in this area it appeared that the string had\r\nbeen tied around the blanket rather tightly at one time while something\r\nwas inside the blanket.[A10-352] Other creases and folds were also\r\npresent, as illustrated in Commission Exhibit No. 663.[A10-353] Among\r\nthese was a crease or hump approximately 10 inches long.[A10-354] This\r\ncrease must have been caused by a hard protruding object approximately\r\n10 inches long which had been tightly wrapped in the blanket, causing\r\nthe yarn to stretch so that the hump was present even when the object\r\nhad been extracted.[A10-355] The hump was approximately the same length\r\nand shape as the telescopic sight on the C2766 rifle, and its position\r\nwith respect to the ends of the blanket was such (based on the manner\r\nin which the blanket was folded when Stombaugh received it) that had\r\nthe rifle been in the blanket the telescopic sight could have made the\r\nhump.[A10-356]\r\n\r\nThe string wrapped around the blanket was made of ordinary white\r\ncotton.[A10-357] It had been tied into a granny knot (a very common\r\nknot tied right over right, right over right) and the dangling ends had\r\nbeen further tied into a bow knot (the knot used on shoelaces).[A10-358]\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the blanket, Stombaugh scraped it to remove the foreign\r\ntextile fibers and hairs that were present.[A10-359] He found numerous\r\nforeign textile fibers of various types and colors, and a number of\r\nlimb, pubic, and head hairs, all of which had originated from persons\r\nof the Caucasian race, and had fallen out naturally, as was shown by\r\nthe shape of their roots.[A10-360] Several of the limb and pubic hairs\r\nmatched samples of Oswald’s limb and pubic hairs obtained by the Dallas\r\npolice in all observable characteristics, including certain relatively\r\nunusual characteristics.[A10-361] For example, in both Oswald’s pubic\r\nhairs and some of the blanket pubic hairs, the color was a medium\r\nbrown, which remained constant to the tip, where it changed to a very\r\nlight brown and then became transparent, due to lack of color pigments;\r\nthe diameters were identical, and rather narrow for pubic hairs; the\r\nhairs were very smooth, lacking the knobbiness characteristic of pubic\r\nhairs, and the upper two-thirds were extremely smooth for pubic hairs;\r\nthe tips of the hairs were sharp, which is unusual for pubic hairs; the\r\ncuticle was very thin for pubic hairs; the scales displayed only a very\r\nsmall protrusion; the pigmentation was very fine, equally dispersed,\r\nand occasionally chained together, and displayed only very slight\r\ngapping; cortical fusi were for the most part absent; the medulla was\r\neither fairly continuous or completely absent; and the root area was\r\nrather clear of pigment, and contained only a fair amount of cortical\r\nfusi, which was unusual.[A10-362] Similarly, in both Oswald’s limb\r\nhairs and some of the limb hairs from the blanket the color was light\r\nbrown through its entire length; the diameter was very fine and did not\r\nnoticeably fluctuate; the tips were very sharp, which is unusual; the\r\nscales were of medium size, with very slight protrusion; there was a\r\nvery slight gapping of the pigmentation near the cuticle; there was an\r\nunusual amount of cortical fusi, equally distributed through the hair\r\nshaft; and the medulla was discontinuous, granular, very bulbous, and\r\nvery uneven.[A10-363]\r\n\r\nOther limb, pubic, and head hairs on the blanket did not come from\r\nOswald.[A10-364]\r\n\r\n_The paper bag._--Stombaugh received the paper bag, Commission\r\nExhibit No. 142, at 7:30 a.m. on November 23, 1963.[A10-365] No\r\nforeign material was found on the outside of the bag except traces\r\nof fingerprint powder and several white cotton fibers, which were of\r\nno significance, since white cotton is the most common textile, and\r\nat any rate the fibers may have come from Stombaugh’s white cotton\r\ngloves.[A10-366] Inside the bag were a tiny wood fragment which was too\r\nminute for comparison purposes, and may have come from the woodpulp\r\nfrom which the paper was made; a particle of a waxy substance, like\r\ncandle wax; and a single brown delustered viscose fiber and several\r\nlight-green cotton fibers.[A10-367]\r\n\r\nThe fibers found inside the bag were compared with brown viscose and\r\ngreen cotton fibers taken from the blanket. The brown viscose fiber\r\nfound in the bag matched some of the brown viscose fibers from the\r\nblanket in all observable characteristics, i.e., shade, diameter,\r\nand size and distribution of delustering agent.[A10-368] The green\r\ncotton fibers found in the bag were, like those from the blanket, of\r\nvarying shades, but of a uniform twist. Each green cotton fiber from\r\nthe bag matched some of the green cotton fibers from the blanket in\r\nall observable characteristics, i.e., shade and degree of twist. Like\r\nthe blanket cotton fibers, the cotton fibers found in the bag were\r\nunmercerized.[A10-369]\r\n\r\n_The shirt._--Stombaugh received the shirt, Commission Exhibit No. 150,\r\nat 7:30 a.m. on November 23, 1963.[A10-370] Examination showed that\r\nit was composed of gray-black, dark blue, and orange-yellow cotton\r\nfibers.[A10-371] The orange-yellow and gray-black cotton fibers were\r\nof a uniform shade, and the dark-blue fibers were of three different\r\nshades.[A10-372] All the fibers were mercerized and of substantially\r\nuniform degree of twist.[A10-373]\r\n\r\n_The C2766 rifle._--The rifle, Commission Exhibit No. 139, was received\r\nin the FBI Laboratory on the morning of November 23, 1963, and\r\nexamined for foreign material at that time.[A10-374] Stombaugh noticed\r\nimmediately that the rifle had been dusted for fingerprints, “and at\r\nthe time I noted to myself that I doubted very much if there would be\r\nany fibers adhering to the outside of this gun--I possibly might find\r\nsome in a crevice some place--because when the latent fingerprint man\r\ndusted this gun, apparently in Dallas, they use a little brush to dust\r\nwith they would have dusted any fibers off the gun at the same time *\r\n* *.”[A10-375] In fact, most of the fibers Stombaugh found were either\r\nadhering to greasy, oily deposits or were jammed down into crevices,\r\nand were so dirty, old, and fragmented that he could not even determine\r\nwhat type of fibers they were.[A10-376] However, Stombaugh found that\r\na tiny tuft of fibers had caught on a jagged edge on the rifle’s metal\r\nbutt plate where it met the end of the wooden stock, and had adhered\r\nto this edge, so that when the rifle had been dusted for fingerprints\r\nthe brush had folded the tuft into a crevice between the butt plate\r\nand the stock, where it remained.[A10-377] Stombaugh described these\r\nfibers as “fresh,”[A10-378] by which he meant that “they were clean,\r\nthey had good color to them, there was no grease on them and they were\r\nnot fragmented.”[A10-379] However, it was not possible to determine how\r\nlong the fibers had been on the rifle, in the absence of information\r\nas to how frequently the rifle had been used.[A10-380] Examination\r\nshowed that the tuft was composed of six or seven orange-yellow,\r\ngray-black, and dark-blue cotton fibers. These fibers were compared\r\nwith fibers from the shirt, Commission Exhibit No. 150, which was also\r\ncomposed of orange-yellow, gray-black, and dark-blue cotton fibers. The\r\norange-yellow and gray-black tuft fibers matched the comparable shirt\r\nfibers in all observable characteristics, i.e., shade and twist. The\r\nthree dark-blue fibers matched two of the three shades of the dark-blue\r\nshirt fibers, and also matched the dark-blue shirt fibers in degree\r\nof twist.[A10-381] Based on these facts, Stombaugh concluded that the\r\ntuft of fibers found on the rifle “could easily” have come from the\r\nshirt, and that “there is no doubt in my mind that these fibers could\r\nhave come from this shirt. There is no way, however, to eliminate\r\nthe possibility of the fibers having come from another identical\r\nshirt.”[A10-382]\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHS\r\n\r\nTwo photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald holding a rifle were found among\r\nOswald’s possessions in Mrs. Ruth Paine’s garage at 2515 West Fifth\r\nStreet, Irving, Tex.[A10-383] In one, Commission Exhibit No. 133-A,\r\nOswald is holding the rifle generally in front of his body; in the\r\nother, Commission Exhibit No. 133-B, he is holding the rifle to his\r\nright. Also found at Mrs. Paine’s garage were a negative of 133-B and\r\nseveral photographs of the rear of General Walker’s house.[A10-384]\r\nAn Imperial reflex camera,[A10-385] which Marina Oswald testified she\r\nused to take 133-A and 133-B, was subsequently produced by Robert\r\nOswald, Lee Harvey Oswald’s brother.[A10-386] Testimony concerning\r\nthe photographs, the negative, and the camera was given by Lyndal\r\nD. Shaneyfelt of the FBI.[A10-387] Shaneyfelt has been connected\r\nwith photographic work since 1937. He has made 100-300 photographic\r\nexaminations, and has testified frequently on the subject in\r\ncourt.[A10-388]\r\n\r\n_Photographs 133-A and 133-B._--The background and lighting in 133-A\r\nand 133-B are virtually identical; the only apparent difference\r\nbetween the two photographs is the pose. However, in 133-A the rifle\r\nis held in a position showing many more of its characteristics than\r\nare shown in 133-B.[A10-389] In order to bring out the details in the\r\nrifle pictured in 133-A, Shaneyfelt rephotographed 133-A and prepared\r\nprints of varying densities from the new negative.[A10-390] He also\r\ntook two new photographs of the C2766 rifle itself: one shows the\r\nrifle in approximately the same position as the rifle pictured in\r\n133-A. The other shows a man holding the rifle simulating the pose in\r\n133-A.[A10-391] Shaneyfelt compared the actual rifle, the photograph\r\n133-A, his rephotographs of 133-A, and the two new photographs to\r\ndetermine whether the rifle pictured in 133-A was the C2766 rifle.\r\nHe found it to be the same in all appearances, noted no differences,\r\nand found a notch in the stock of the C2766 which also appeared very\r\nfaintly in 133-A. However, he did not find enough peculiarities\r\nto positively identify the rifle in 133-A as the C2766 rifle, as\r\ndistinguished from other rifles of the same configuration.[A10-392]\r\n\r\nThe rifle’s position in 133-B is such that less of its characteristics\r\nwere visible than in 133-A; essentially, 133-B shows only the bottom\r\nof the rifle. However, the characteristics of the rifle visible in\r\n133-B are also similar to the observable characteristics of the C2766\r\nrifle, except that while the C2766 rifle was equipped with a homemade\r\nleather sling when it was found after the assassination, the rifle\r\nin 133-B seems to be equipped with a homemade rope sling.[A10-393]\r\nThe portion of the sling visible in 133-A is too small to establish\r\nwhether it is rope or leather, but it has the appearance of rope,\r\nand its configuration is consistent with the rope sling pictured in\r\n133-B.[A10-394]\r\n\r\n_The negative._--Shaneyfelt’s examination of the negative, Commission\r\nExhibit No. 749, showed that the photograph, 133-B, had been printed\r\ndirectly or indirectly from the negative. It was Shaneyfelt’s opinion\r\nthat 133-B had been directly from the negative, but he could not\r\nabsolutely eliminate the possibility of an internegative, that is,\r\nthe possibility that a print had been produced from the negative 749,\r\na photograph had been taken of that print, and 133-B had been produced\r\nfrom the new negative, rather than from the original negative.[A10-395]\r\n“I think this is highly unlikely, because if this were the result of a\r\ncopied negative, there would normally be evidence that I could detect,\r\nsuch as a loss of detail and imperfections that show up due to the\r\nadded process.”[A10-396] In any event, any “intermediate” print would\r\nhave been virtually indistinguishable from 133-B, so that Shaneyfelt’s\r\ntestimony conclusively established that either 133-B or a virtually\r\nindistinguishable print had been produced from the negative 749.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 751\r\n\r\nOswald’s Imperial Reflex camera, with the back removed to show the\r\ncamera’s film-plane aperture.]\r\n\r\n_The camera._--The Imperial camera, Commission Exhibit No. 750, was\r\na relatively inexpensive, fixed-focus, one-shutter-speed, box-type\r\ncamera, made in the United States.[A10-397] Shaneyfelt compared this\r\ncamera with the negative, Commission Exhibit No. 749, to determine\r\nwhether this negative had been taken with the camera.[A10-398] To make\r\nthis determination, Shaneyfelt compared the margins of the image on\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 749 with the margins of the image on a negative\r\nhe himself had taken with the camera. Microscopic examination shows\r\nthat the margins of a negative’s image, although apparently straight,\r\nare actually irregular. The irregularities usually do not show on\r\na finished print, because they are blocked out to give the print a\r\nneat border.[A10-399] The cause of these irregularities can be best\r\nunderstood by examination of Commission Exhibit No. 751 (p. 594), a\r\nphotograph of the Imperial camera with the back removed to show the\r\ncamera’s film-plane aperture. When the camera’s shutter is opened,\r\nlight exposes that portion of the film which is not blocked off by\r\nthis aperture. The edges of the aperture, therefore, define the edges\r\nof the image which will appear on the developed negative. In effect,\r\nthe edge of the image is a shadowgraph of the edge of the aperture. As\r\nShaneyfelt testified:\r\n\r\n    * * * the basis of the examination was a close microscopic\r\n    study of the negative made in the camera to study the\r\n    shadowgraph that is made of the edge of the aperture.\r\n\r\n    As the film is placed across the aperture of the camera, and\r\n    the shutter is opened, light comes through and exposes the\r\n    film only in the opening within the edges. Where the film is\r\n    out over the edges of the aperture it is not exposed, and your\r\n    result is an exposed negative with a clear edge, and on the\r\n    negative then, the edges of that exposure of the photograph,\r\n    are actually shadowgraphs of the edges of the aperture.[A10-400]\r\n\r\nThe basis of the identification is that the microscopic characteristics\r\nof every film-plane aperture, like those of a rifle barrel, are\r\ndistinctive, for much the same reason; that is, when the camera is\r\nmanufactured, certain handwork is done which differs microscopically\r\nfrom camera to camera, and further differences accrue as the camera is\r\nused. As Shaneyfelt testified:\r\n\r\n    Q. Mr. Shaneyfelt, what is the basis of your statement, the\r\n    theoretical basis of your statement, that every camera with\r\n    this type of back aperture arrangement is unique in the\r\n    characteristics of the shadowgraph it makes on the negative?\r\n\r\n    Mr. SHANEYFELT. It is because of the minute variations that\r\n    even two cameras from the same mold will have. Additional\r\n    handwork on cameras, or filing the edges where a little bit\r\n    of plastic or a little bit of metal stays on, make individual\r\n    characteristics apart from those that would be general\r\n    characteristics on all of them from the same mold.\r\n\r\n    In addition, as the film moves across the camera and it is\r\n    used for a considerable length of time, dirt and debris tend\r\n    to accumulate a little--or if the aperture is painted, little\r\n    lumps in the paint will make little bumps along that edge that\r\n    would make that then individually different from every other\r\n    camera.\r\n\r\n    Q. Is this similar then to toolmark identification?\r\n\r\n    Mr. SHANEYFELT. Very similar; yes.[A10-401]\r\n\r\nBased on his examination of the shadowgraph on the negative, Commission\r\nExhibit No. 749, Shaneyfelt determined that it had been taken with the\r\nImperial camera.[A10-402]\r\n\r\nThree edges of the shadowgraph of the film-plane aperture were also\r\nvisible on one of the photographs of General Walker’s house, not having\r\nbeen blocked out in the making of the print. On the basis of these\r\nthree margins, Shaneyfelt determined that this photograph had also\r\nbeen taken with Oswald’s Imperial Reflex camera. Shaneyfelt could not\r\ndetermine whether 133-A had been photographed with the Imperial camera,\r\nbecause the negative of 133-A had not been found, and the print itself\r\ndid not show a shadowgraph area.[A10-403]\r\n\r\nDuring his interrogations Oswald had been shown 133-A, and had claimed\r\nit was a composite--that the face in the picture was his, but the body\r\nwas not.[A10-404] Shaneyfelt examined 133-A and 133-B to determine if\r\nthey were composite pictures. He concluded that they were not:\r\n\r\n    * * * it is my opinion that they are not composites. Again\r\n    with very, very minor reservation, because I cannot entirely\r\n    eliminate an extremely expert composite. I have examined many\r\n    composite photographs, and there is always an inconsistency,\r\n    either in lighting of the portion that is added, or the\r\n    configuration indicating a different lens used for the part\r\n    that was added to the original photograph, things many times\r\n    that you can’t point to and say this is a characteristic, or\r\n    that is a characteristic, but they have definite variations\r\n    that are not consistent throughout the picture.\r\n\r\n    I found no such characteristics in this picture.\r\n\r\n    In addition, with a composite it is always necessary to make a\r\n    print that you then make a pasteup of. In this instance paste\r\n    the face in, and rephotograph it, and then retouch out the area\r\n    where the head was cut out, which would leave a characteristic\r\n    that would be retouched out on the negative and then that would\r\n    be printed.\r\n\r\n    Normally, this retouching can be seen under magnification in\r\n    the resulting composite--points can be seen where the edge of\r\n    the head had been added and it hadn’t been entirely retouched\r\n    out.\r\n\r\n    This can nearly always be detected under magnification. I found\r\n    no such characteristics in these pictures.\r\n\r\n    Q. Did you use the technique of magnification in your analysis?\r\n\r\n\r\n    A. Yes.[A10-405]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the negative, Commission Exhibit No. 749, showed\r\nabsolutely no doctoring or composition.[A10-406] Since the negative\r\nwas made in Oswald’s Imperial camera, Commission Exhibit No. 750, a\r\ncomposite of 133-B could have been made only by putting two pictures\r\ntogether and rephotographing them in the Imperial camera--all without\r\nleaving a discernible trace. This, to Shaneyfelt, was “in the realm of\r\nthe impossible”:\r\n\r\n    In addition, in this instance regarding 133-B which I have just\r\n    stated, I have identified as being photographed or exposed in\r\n    the camera which is Exhibit 750, for this to be a composite,\r\n    they would have had to make a picture of the background with\r\n    an individual standing there, and then substitute the face,\r\n    and retouch it and then possibly rephotograph it and retouch\r\n    that negative, and make a print, and then photograph it with\r\n    this camera, which is Commission Exhibit 750, in order to have\r\n    this negative which we have identified with the camera, and is\r\n    Commission Exhibit 749.\r\n\r\n    This to me is beyond reasonable doubt, it just doesn’t\r\n    seem that it would be at all possible, in this particular\r\n    photograph.[A10-407]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Q. You have the negative of this? [Referring to Exhibit 133B.]\r\n\r\n    A. We have the negative of 133B.\r\n\r\n    Q. You have the negative of 133B. That negative in itself shows\r\n    no doctoring or composition at all?\r\n\r\n    A. It shows absolutely no doctoring or composition.\r\n\r\n    Q. So that the only composition that could have been made would\r\n    have been in this process which you have described of picture\r\n    on picture and negative and then photographing?\r\n\r\n    A. And then finally rephotographing with this camera.\r\n\r\n    Q. Rephotographing with this camera, this very camera?\r\n\r\n    A. That is correct, and this then, to me, becomes in the realm\r\n    of the impossible.[A10-408]\r\n\r\nFollowing the assassination, photographs similar to 133-A appeared\r\nin a number of newspapers and magazines.[A10-409] At least some of\r\nthese photographs, as reproduced, differed both from 133-A and from\r\neach other in minor details.[A10-410] Shaneyfelt examined several of\r\nthese reproductions and concluded that in each case the individual\r\npublisher had taken a reproduction of 133-A and retouched it in various\r\nways, apparently for clarifying purposes, thus accounting for the\r\ndifferences between the reproductions and 133-A, and the differences\r\nbetween the reproductions themselves.[A10-411] Subsequently one of\r\nthe publishers involved submitted the original photographs which it\r\nhad retouched. Shaneyfelt’s examination of this photograph confirmed\r\nhis original conclusion.[A10-412] The remaining publishers either\r\nconfirmed that they had retouched the photographs they had used, or\r\nfailed to contradict Shaneyfelt’s testimony after having been given an\r\nopportunity to do so.[A10-413]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XI\r\n\r\nReports Relating to the Interrogation of Lee Harvey Oswald at the\r\nDallas Police Department\r\n\r\n\r\nAs discussed in chapters IV and V, Lee Harvey Oswald was interrogated\r\nfor a total of approximately 12 hours between 2:30 p.m. on Friday,\r\nNovember 22, 1963, and 11:15 a.m. on Sunday, November 24, 1963. There\r\nwere no stenographic or tape recordings of these interviews. Several of\r\nthe investigators present at one or more of the interrogation sessions,\r\nprior to testifying before the Commission, had prepared memoranda\r\nsetting forth their recollections of the questioning of Oswald and his\r\nresponses. The following are the most important of these reports.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF CAPT. J. W. FRITZ, DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\nINTERROGATION OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD\r\n\r\nWe conducted the investigation at the Texas Book Depository Building\r\non November 22, 1963, immediately after the President was shot and\r\nafter we had found the location where Lee Harvey Oswald had done the\r\nshooting from and left three empty cartridge cases on the floor and the\r\nrifle had been found partially hidden under some boxes near the back\r\nstairway. These pieces of evidence were protected until the Crime Lab\r\ncould get pictures and make a search for fingerprints. After Lt. Day,\r\nof the Crime Lab, had finished his work with the rifle, I picked it\r\nup and found that it had a cartridge in the chamber, which I ejected.\r\nAbout this time some officer came to me and told me that Mr. Roy S.\r\nTruly wanted to see me, as one of his men had left the building. I had\r\ntalked to Mr. Truly previously, and at that time he thought everyone\r\nwas accounted for who worked in the building. Mr. Truly then came with\r\nanother officer and told me that a Lee Harvey Oswald had left the\r\nbuilding. I asked if he had an address where this man lived, and he\r\ntold me that he did, that it was in Irving at 2515 W. 5th Street.\r\n\r\nI then left the rest of the search of the building with Chief Lumpkin\r\nand other officers who were there and told Dets. R. K. Sims and E. L.\r\nBoyd to accompany me to the City Hall where we could make a quick check\r\nfor police record and any other information of value, and we would then\r\ngo to Irving, Texas, in an effort to apprehend this man. While I was\r\nin the building, I was told that Officer J. D. Tippit had been shot in\r\nOak Cliff. Immediately after I reached my office, I asked the officers\r\nwho had brought in a prisoner from the Tippit shooting who the man was\r\nwho shot the officer. They told me his name was Lee Harvey Oswald,\r\nand I replied that that was our suspect in the President’s killing. I\r\ninstructed the officers to bring this man into the office after talking\r\nto the officers for a few minutes in the presence of Officers R. M.\r\nSims and E. L. Boyd of the Homicide Bureau and possibly some Secret\r\nService men. Just as I had started questioning this man, I received\r\na call from Gordon Shanklin, Agent in Charge of the FBI office here\r\nin Dallas, who asked me to let him talk to Jim Bookhout, one of his\r\nagents. He told Mr. Bookhout that he would like for James P. Hosty to\r\nsit in on this interview as he knew about these people and had been\r\ninvestigating them before. I invited Mr. Bookhout and Mr. Hosty in to\r\nhelp with the interview.\r\n\r\nAfter some questions about this man’s full name I asked him if he\r\nworked for the Texas School Book Depository, and he told me he did. I\r\nasked him which floor he worked on, and he said usually on the second\r\nfloor but sometimes his work took him to all the different floors. I\r\nasked him what part of the building he was in at the time the President\r\nwas shot, and he said that he was having his lunch about that time on\r\nthe first floor. Mr. Truly had told me that one of the police officers\r\nhad stopped this man immediately after the shooting somewhere near the\r\nback stairway, so I asked Oswald where he was when the police officer\r\nstopped him. He said he was on the second floor drinking a coca cola\r\nwhen the officer came in. I asked him why he left the building, and he\r\nsaid there was so much excitement he didn’t think there would be any\r\nmore work done that day, and that as this company wasn’t particular\r\nabout their hours, that they did not punch a clock, and that he thought\r\nit would be just as well that he left for the rest of the afternoon.\r\nI asked him if he owned a rifle, and he said that he did not. He said\r\nthat he had seen one at the building a few days ago, and that Mr. Truly\r\nand some of the employees were looking at it. I asked him where he went\r\nto when he left work, and he told me that he had a room on 1026 North\r\nBeckley, that he went over there and changed his trousers and got his\r\npistol and went to the picture show. I asked him why he carried his\r\npistol, and he remarked, “You know how boys do when they have a gun,\r\nthey just carry it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hosty asked Oswald if he had been in Russia. He told him, “Yes,\r\nhe had been in Russia three years.” He asked him if he had written to\r\nthe Russian Embassy, and he said he had. This man became very upset\r\nand arrogant with Agent Hosty when he questioned him and accused him\r\nof accosting his wife two different times. When Agent Hosty attempted\r\nto talk to this man, he would hit his fist on the desk. I asked Oswald\r\nwhat he meant by accosting his wife when he was talking to Mr. Hosty.\r\nHe said Mr. Hosty mistreated his wife two different times when he\r\ntalked with her, practically accosted her. Mr. Hosty also asked Oswald\r\nif he had been to Mexico City, which he denied. During this interview\r\nhe told me that he had gone to school in New York and in Fort Worth,\r\nTexas, that after going into the Marines, finished his high school\r\neducation. I asked him if he won any medals for rifle shooting in the\r\nMarines. He said he won the usual medals.\r\n\r\nI asked him what his political beliefs were, and he said he had none\r\nbut that he belonged to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and told me\r\nthat they had headquarters in New York and that he had been Secretary\r\nfor this organization in New Orleans when he lived there. He also said\r\nthat he supports the Castro Revolution. One of the officers had told\r\nme that he had rented the room on Beckley under the name of O. F. Lee.\r\nI asked him why he did this. He said the landlady did it. She didn’t\r\nunderstand his name correctly.\r\n\r\nOswald asked if he was allowed an attorney and I told him he could have\r\nany attorney he liked, and that the telephone would be available to him\r\nup in the jail and he could call anyone he wished. I believe it was\r\nduring this interview that he first expressed a desire to talk to Mr.\r\nAbt, an attorney in New York. Interviews on this day were interrupted\r\nby showups where witnesses identified Oswald positively as the man\r\nwho killed Officer Tippit, and the time that I would have to talk to\r\nanother witness or to some of the officers. One of these showups was\r\nheld at 4:35 pm and the next one at 6:30 pm, and at 7:55 pm. At 7:05 pm\r\nI signed a complaint before Bill Alexander of the District Attorney’s\r\noffice, charging Oswald with the Tippit murder. At 7:10 pm Tippit was\r\narraigned before Judge Johnston. During the second interview I asked\r\nOswald about a card that he had in his purse showing that he belonged\r\nto the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which he admitted was his. I\r\nasked him about another identification card in his pocket bearing the\r\nname of Alex Hidell. He said he picked up that name in New Orleans\r\nwhile working in the Fair Play for Cuba organization. He said he spoke\r\nRussian, that he corresponded with people in Russia, and that he\r\nreceived newspapers from Russia.\r\n\r\nI showed the rifle to Marina Oswald, and she could not positively\r\nidentify it, but said that it looked like the rifle that her husband\r\nhad and that he had been keeping it in the garage at Mrs. Paine’s home\r\nin Irving. After this, I questioned Oswald further about the rifle,\r\nbut he denied owning a rifle at all, and said that he did have a small\r\nrifle some years past. I asked him if he owned a rifle in Russia, and\r\nhe said, “You know you can’t buy a rifle in Russia, you can only buy\r\nshotguns. I had a shotgun in Russia and hunted some while there.”\r\nMarina Oswald had told me that she thought her husband might have\r\nbrought the rifle from New Orleans, which he denied. He told me that he\r\nhad some things stored in a garage at Mrs. Paine’s home in Irving and\r\nthat he had a few personal effects at his room on Beckley. I instructed\r\nthe officers to make a thorough search of both of these places.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing all of the evidence pertaining to the killing of\r\nPresident Kennedy before District Attorney Henry Wade and his\r\nassistant, Bill Alexander, and Jim Allen, former First Assistant\r\nDistrict Attorney of Dallas County, I signed a complaint before the\r\nDistrict Attorney charging Oswald with the murder of President Kennedy.\r\nThis was at 11:26 pm. He was arraigned before Judge David Johnston at\r\n1:35 am, November 23, 1963.\r\n\r\nOswald was placed in jail about 12:00 midnight and brought from the\r\njail for arraignment before Judge David Johnston at 1:36 am.\r\n\r\nOn November 23 at 10:25 AM Oswald was brought from the jail for an\r\ninterview. Present at this time was FBI agent Jim Bookhout, Forrest\r\nSorrells, special agent and in charge of Secret Service, United States\r\nMarshall Robert Nash, and Homicide officers. During this interview I\r\ntalked to Oswald about his leaving the building and he told me he left\r\nby bus and rode to a stop near home and walked on to his house. At\r\nthe time of Oswald’s arrest he had a bus transfer in his pocket. He\r\nadmitted this was given to him by the bus driver when he rode the bus\r\nafter leaving the building.\r\n\r\nOne of the officers had told me that a cab driver, William Wayne\r\nWhaley, thought he had recognized Oswald’s picture as the man who had\r\ngotten in his cab near the bus station and rode to Becklay Avenue. I\r\nasked Oswald if he had ridden a cab on that day, and he said, “Yes, I\r\ndid ride in the cab. The bus I got on near where I work got into heavy\r\ntraffic and was traveling too slow, and I got off and caught a cab.” I\r\nasked him about his conversation with the cab driver, and he said he\r\nremembered that when he got in the cab a lady came up who also wanted a\r\ncab, and he told Oswald to tell the lady to “take another cab”.\r\n\r\nWe found from the investigation the day before that when Oswald left\r\nhome, he was carrying a long package. He usually went to see his wife\r\nof week ends, but this time he had gone on Thursday night. I asked him\r\nif he had told Buell Wesley Frazier why he had gone home a different\r\nnight, and if he had told him anything about bringing back some curtain\r\nrods. He denied it.\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation he told me he reached his home by cab and\r\nchanged both his shirt and trousers before going to the show. He\r\nsaid his cab fare home was 85 cents. When asked what he did with his\r\nclothing he took off when he got home, he said he put them in the dirty\r\nclothes. In talking with him further about his location at the time the\r\nPresident was killed, he said he ate lunch with some of the colored\r\nboys who worked with him. One of them was called “Junior” and the other\r\none was a little short man whose name he did not know. He said he had\r\na cheese sandwich and some fruit and that was the only package he\r\nhad brought with him to work and denied that he had brought the long\r\npackage described by Mr. Frazier and his sister.\r\n\r\nI asked him why he lived in a room, while his wife lived in Irving. He\r\nsaid Mrs. Paine, the lady his wife lived with, was learning Russian,\r\nthat his wife needed help with the young baby, and that it made a nice\r\narrangement for both of them. He said he didn’t know Mr. Paine very\r\nwell, but Mr. Paine and his wife, he thought, were separated a great\r\ndeal of the time. He said he owned no car, but that the Paines have two\r\ncars, and told that in the garage at the Paine’s home he had some sea\r\nbags that had a lot of his personal belongings, that he had left them\r\nthere after coming back from New Orleans in September.\r\n\r\nHe said he had a brother, Robert, who lived in Fort Worth. We later\r\nfound that this brother lived in Denton. He said the Paines were close\r\nfriends of his.\r\n\r\nI asked him if he belonged to the Communist Party, but he said that he\r\nhad never had a card, but repeated that he belonged to the Fair Play\r\nfor Cuba organization, and he said that he belonged to the American\r\nCivil Liberties Union and paid $5.00 dues. I asked him again why he\r\ncarried the pistol to the show. He refused to answer questions about\r\nthe pistol. He did tell me, however, that he had bought it several\r\nmonths before in Fort Worth, Texas.\r\n\r\nI noted that in questioning him that he did answer very quickly, and I\r\nasked him if he had ever been questioned before, and he told me that\r\nhe had. He was questioned one time for a long time by the FBI after he\r\nhad returned from Russia. He said they used different methods, they\r\ntried the hard and soft, and the buddy method, and said he was very\r\nfamiliar with interrogation. He reminded me that he did not have to\r\nanswer any questions at all until he talked to his attorney, and I told\r\nhim again that he could have an attorney any time he wished. He said\r\nhe didn’t have money to pay for a phone call to Mr. Abt. I told him to\r\ncall “collect”, if he liked, to use the jail phone or that he could\r\nhave another attorney if he wished. He said he didn’t want another\r\nattorney, he wanted to talk to this attorney first. I believe he made\r\nthis call later as he thanked me later during one of our interviews\r\nfor allowing him the use of the telephone. I explained to him that all\r\nprisoners were allowed to use the telephone. I asked him why he wanted\r\nMr. Abt, instead of some available attorney. He told me he didn’t know\r\nMr. Abt personally, but that he was familiar with a case where Mr. Abt\r\ndefended some people for a violation of the Smith Act, and that if he\r\ndidn’t get Mr. Abt, that he felt sure the American Civil Liberties\r\nUnion would furnish him a lawyer. He explained to me that this\r\norganization helped people who needed attorneys and weren’t able to get\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhile in New Orleans, he lived at 1907 Magazine Street and at one time\r\nworked for the William Riley Company near that address. When asked\r\nabout any previous arrests, he told me that he had had a little trouble\r\nwhile working with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and had a fight\r\nwith some anti-Castro people. He also told me of a debate on some radio\r\nstation in New Orleans where he debated with some anti-Castro people.\r\n\r\nI asked him what he thought of President Kennedy and his family, and\r\nhe said he didn’t have any views on the President. He said, “I like\r\nthe President’s family very well. I have my own views about national\r\npolicies.” I asked him about a polygraph test. He told me he had\r\nrefused a polygraph test with the FBI, and he certainly wouldn’t take\r\none at this time. Both Mr. Bookhout, of the FBI, and Mr. Kelley, and\r\nthe Marshall asked Oswald some questions during this interview.\r\n\r\nOswald was placed back in jail at 11:33 am. At 12:35 pm Oswald was\r\nbrought to the office for another interview with Inspector Kelley and\r\nsome of the other officers and myself. I talked to Oswald about the\r\ndifferent places he had lived in Dallas in an effort to find where\r\nhe was living when the picture was made of him holding a rifle which\r\nlooked to be the same rifle we had recovered. This picture showed to be\r\ntaken near a stairway with many identifying things in the back yard. He\r\ntold me about one of the places where he had lived.\r\n\r\nMr. Paine had told me about where Oswald lived on Neely Street. Oswald\r\nwas very evasive about this location. We found later that this was the\r\nplace where the picture was made. I again asked him about his property\r\nand where his things might be kept, and he told me about the things at\r\nMrs. Paine’s residence and a few things on Beckley. He was placed back\r\nin jail at 1:10 PM.\r\n\r\nAt 6:00 PM I instructed the officers to bring Oswald back into the\r\noffice, and in the presence of Jim Bookhout, Homicide officers, and\r\nInspector Kelley, of the Secret Service, I showed Oswald an enlarged\r\npicture of him holding a rifle and wearing a pistol. This picture had\r\nbeen enlarged by our Crime Lab from a picture found in the garage at\r\nMrs. Paine’s house. He said the picture was not his, that the face was\r\nhis face, but that this picture had been made by someone superimposing\r\nhis face, the other part of the picture was not him at all and that he\r\nhad never seen the picture before. When I told him that the picture\r\nwas recovered from Mrs. Paine’s garage, he said that the picture had\r\nnever been in his possession, and I explained to him that it was an\r\nenlargement of the small picture obtained in the search. At that time\r\nI showed him the smaller picture. He denied ever seeing that picture\r\nand said that he knew all about photography, that he had done a lot\r\nof work in photography himself, that the small picture was a reduced\r\npicture of the large picture, and had been made by some person unknown\r\nto him. He further stated that since he had been photographed here at\r\nthe City Hall and that people had been taking his picture while being\r\ntransferred from my office to the jail door that someone had been able\r\nto get a picture of his face and that with that, they had made this\r\npicture. He told me that he understood photography real well, and that\r\nin time, he would be able to show that it was not his picture, and that\r\nit had been made by someone else. At this time he said that he did not\r\nwant to answer any more questions and he was returned to the jail about\r\n7:15 pm.\r\n\r\nAt 9:30 on the morning of November 24, I asked that Oswald be brought\r\nto the office. At that time I showed him a map of the City of Dallas\r\nwhich had been recovered in the search of his room on North Beckley.\r\nThis map had some markings on it, one of which was about where the\r\nPresident was shot. He said that the map had nothing to do with\r\nthe President’s shooting and again, as he had one in the previous\r\ninterviews, denied knowing anything about the shooting of the\r\nPresident, or of the shooting of Officer Tippit. He said the map had\r\nbeen used to locate buildings where he had gone to talk to people about\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nDuring this interview Inspector Kelley asked Oswald about his religious\r\nviews, and he replied that he didn’t agree with all the philosophies\r\non religion. He seemed evasive with Inspector Kelley about how he felt\r\nabout religion, and I asked him if he believed in a Diety. He was\r\nevasive and didn’t answer this question.\r\n\r\nSomeone of the Federal officers asked Oswald if he thought Cuba would\r\nbe better off since the President was assassinated. To this he replied\r\nthat he felt that since the President was killed that someone else\r\nwould take his place, perhaps Vice-President Johnson, and that his\r\nviews would probably be largely the same as those of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nI again asked him about the gun and about the picture of him holding a\r\nsimilar rifle, and at that time he again positively denied having any\r\nknowledge of the picture or the rifle and denied that he had ever lived\r\non Neely Street, and when I told him that friends who had visited him\r\nthere said that he had lived there, he said that they were mistaken\r\nabout visiting him there, because he had never lived there.\r\n\r\nDuring this interview, Oswald said he was a Marxist. He repeated two or\r\nthree times, “I am a Marxist, but not a Leninist-Marxist.” He told me\r\nthat the station that he had debated on in New Orleans was the one who\r\ncarried Bill Stakey’s program. He denied again knowing Alex Hidell in\r\nNew Orleans, and again reiterated his belief in Fair Play for Cuba and\r\nwhat the committee stood for.\r\n\r\nAfter some questioning, Chief Jesse E. Curry came to the office and\r\nasked me if I was ready for the man to be transferred. I told him we\r\nwere ready as soon as the security was completed in the basement, where\r\nwe were to place Oswald in a car to transfer him to the County Jail.\r\nI had objected to the cameras obstructing the jail door, and the\r\nChief explained to me that these have been moved, and the people were\r\nmoved back, and the cameramen were well back in the garage. I told the\r\nChief then that we were ready to go. He told us to go ahead with the\r\nprisoner, and that he and Chief Stevenson, who was with him, would meet\r\nus at the County Jail.\r\n\r\nOswald’s shirt, which he was wearing at the time of arrest, had been\r\nremoved and sent to the crime lab in Washington with all the other\r\nevidence for a comparison test. Oswald said he would like to have a\r\nshirt from his clothing that had been brought to the office to wear\r\nover the T-short that he was wearing at the time. We selected the\r\nbest-looking shirt from his things, but he said he would prefer wearing\r\na black Ivy League type shirt, indicating that it might be a little\r\nwarmer. We made this change and I asked him if he wouldn’t like to\r\nwear a hat to more or less camouflage his looks in the car while being\r\ntransferred as all of the people who had been viewing him had seen him\r\nbareheaded. He didn’t want to do this. Then Officer J. R. Leavalle\r\nhandcuffed his left hand to Oswald’s right hand, then we left the\r\noffice for the transfer.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as this report was made from rough notes and memory, it is\r\nentirely possible that one of these questions could be in a separate\r\ninterview from the one indicated in this report. He was interviewed\r\nunder the most adverse conditions in my office which is 9 feet 6 inches\r\nby 14 feet, and has only one front door, which forced us to move this\r\nprisoner through hundreds of people each time he was carried from my\r\noffice to the jail door, some 20 feet, during each of these transfers.\r\nThe crowd would attempt to jam around him, shouting questions and\r\nmany containing slurs. This office is also surrounded by large glass\r\nwindows, and there were many officers working next to these windows. I\r\nhave no records in this office and was unable to record the interview.\r\nI was interrupted many times during these interviews to step from the\r\noffice to talk to another witness or secure additional information from\r\nofficers needed for the interrogation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORTS OF AGENTS OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nFD-302 (Rev 3-3-59) FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\n            Date 11/23/63\r\n\r\nLEE HARVEY OSWALD, 1026 North Beckley, Dallas, Texas, was interviewed\r\nby Captain WILL FRITZ of the Homicide Bureau, Dallas Police Department.\r\nSpecial Agents JAMES P. HOSTY, JR. and JAMES W. BOOKHOUT were present\r\nduring this interview. When the Agents entered the interview room at\r\n3:15 p.m., Captain FRITZ had been previously interviewing LEE HARVEY\r\nOSWALD for an undetermined period of time. Both Agents identified\r\nthemselves to OSWALD and advised him they were law enforcement officers\r\nand anything he said could be used against him. OSWALD at this time\r\nadopted a violent attitude toward the FBI and both Agents and made\r\nmany uncomplimentary remarks about the FBI. OSWALD requested that\r\nCaptain FRITZ remove the cuffs from him, it being noted that OSWALD\r\nwas handcuffed with his hands behind him. Captain FRITZ had one of his\r\ndetectives remove the handcuffs and handcuff OSWALD with his hands in\r\nfront of him.\r\n\r\nCaptain FRITZ asked OSWALD if he ever owned a rifle and OSWALD stated\r\nthat he had observed a MR. TRUELY (phonetic), a supervisor at the Texas\r\nSchoolbook Depository on November 20, 1963, display a rifle to some\r\nindividuals in his office on the first floor of the Texas Schoolbook\r\nDepository, but denied ever owning a rifle himself. OSWALD stated that\r\nhe had never been in Mexico except to Tijuana on one occasion. However,\r\nhe admitted to Captain FRITZ to having resided in the Soviet Union for\r\nthree years where he has many friends and relatives of his wife.\r\n\r\nOSWALD also admitted that he was the secretary for the Fair Play for\r\nCuba Committee in New Orleans, Louisiana a few months ago. OSWALD\r\nstated that the Fair Play for Cuba Committee has its headquarters\r\nin New York City. OSWALD admitted to having received an award for\r\nmarksmanship while a member of the U.S. Marine Corps. He further\r\nadmitted that he was living at 1026 N. Beckley in Dallas, Texas, under\r\nthe name of O. H. LEE. OSWALD admitted that he was present in the Texas\r\nSchoolbook Depository on November 22, 1963, where he has been employed\r\nsince October 15, 1963. OSWALD stated that as a laborer, he has access\r\nto the entire building which has offices on the first and second floors\r\nand storage on the third and fourth, as well as the fifth and sixth\r\nfloors. OSWALD stated that he went to lunch at approximately noon\r\nand he claimed he ate his lunch on the first floor in the lunchroom;\r\nhowever he went to the second floor where the Coca-Cola machine was\r\nlocated and obtained a bottle of Coca-Cola for his lunch. OSWALD\r\nclaimed to be on the first floor when President JOHN F. KENNEDY passed\r\nthis building.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing what had happened, he said that because of all the\r\nconfusion there would be no work performed that afternoon so he decided\r\nto go home. OSWALD stated he then went home by bus and changed his\r\nclothes and went to a movie. OSWALD admitted to carrying a pistol with\r\nhim to this movie stating he did this because he felt like it, giving\r\nno other reason. OSWALD further admitted attempting to fight the Dallas\r\npolice officers who arrested him in this movie theater when he received\r\na cut and a bump.\r\n\r\nOSWALD frantically denied shooting Dallas police officer TIPPETT or\r\nshooting President JOHN F. KENNEDY. The interview was concluded at 4:05\r\np.m. when OSWALD was removed for a lineup.\r\n\r\non 11/22/63 at Dallas, Texas\r\n\r\nFile # DL 89-43\r\n\r\nby Special Agents JAMES P.

He was requested to furnish descriptive and\r\nbiographical data concerning himself.\r\n\r\nThe following was obtained from his responses and examination of\r\ncontents of his wallet:\r\n\r\nOSWALD declined to explain his possession of a photograph of a\r\nSelective Service card in the name of “ALEK JAMES HIDELL”.\r\n\r\nWhen interview had been substantially completed and OSWALD was asked\r\nas to his present employment, he stated he thought perhaps interview\r\nto obtain descriptive information was too prolonged, that he had\r\ndeclined to be interviewed by any other officers previously, and did\r\nnot desire to be interviewed by this agent. He remarked “I know your\r\ntactics--there is a similar agency in Russia.

He advised that he saw a\r\nrifle day before yesterday at the Texas School Book Depository which\r\nMR. TRULY and two other gentlemen had in their possession and were\r\nlooking at.\r\n\r\nOSWALD stated that on November 22, 1963, at the time of the search of\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository building by Dallas police officers,\r\nhe was on the second floor of said building, having just purchased a\r\nCoca-cola from the soft-drink machine, at which time a police officer\r\ncame into the room with pistol drawn and asked him if he worked there.\r\nMR. TRULY was present and verified that he was an employee and the\r\npolice officer thereafter left the room and continued through the\r\nbuilding. OSWALD stated that he took this Coke down to the first\r\nfloor and stood around and had lunch in the employees lunch room. He\r\nthereafter went outside and stood around for five or ten minutes with\r\nforeman BILL SHELLY, and thereafter went home. He stated that he left\r\nwork because, in his opinion, based upon remarks of BILL SHELLY, he\r\ndid not believe that there was going to be any more work that day\r\ndue to the confusion in the building. He stated after arriving at\r\nhis residence, then he went to a movie, where he was subsequently\r\napprehended by the Dallas Police Department.\r\n\r\nOSWALD stated that his hours of work at the Texas School Book\r\nDepository are from 8 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., but that he is not required to\r\npunch a time clock. His usual place of work in the building is on the\r\nfirst floor; however, he frequently is required to go to the fourth,\r\nfifth, sixth, and seventh floors of the building in order to get books\r\nand this was true on November 22, 1963, and he had been on all of the\r\nfloors in the performance of his duties on November 22, 1963.\r\n\r\non 11/22/63\r\n\r\nat Dallas, Texas\r\n\r\nFile # DL 89-43\r\n\r\nby Special Agent JAMES W.

FRITZ, Homicide and\r\nRobbery Bureau, Dallas Police Department. OSWALD was advised of the\r\nidentity of SA JAMES W. BOOKHOUT, and his capacity as a Special Agent\r\nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He was informed of his right\r\nto an attorney, that any statement he might make could be used against\r\nhim in a court of law, and that any statement which he might make must\r\nbe free and voluntary. He furnished the following information in the\r\npresence of T. J. TULLY, U.S. Secret Service; DAVID B. GRANT, Secret\r\nService; ROBERT I. NASH, United States Marshall; and Detectives BILLY\r\nL. SENKEL and FAY M. TURNER of the Homicide and Robbery Bureau, Dallas\r\nPolice Department.\r\n\r\nFollowing his departure from the Texas School Book Depository, he\r\nboarded a city bus to his residence and obtained transfer upon\r\ndeparture from the bus. He stated that officers at the time of\r\narresting him took his transfer out of his pocket.\r\n\r\nOSWALD advised that he had only one post office box which was at\r\nDallas, Texas. He denied bringing any package to work on the morning of\r\nNovember 22, 1963. He stated that he was not in the process of fixing\r\nup his apartment and he denied telling WESLEY FRAZIER that the purpose\r\nof his visit to Irving, Texas, on the night of November 21, 1963, was\r\nto obtain some curtain rods from MRS. RUTH PAINE.\r\n\r\nOSWALD stated that it was not exactly true as recently stated by him\r\nthat he rode a bus from his place of employment to his residence on\r\nNovember 22, 1963. He stated actually he did board a city bus at his\r\nplace of employment but that after about a block or two, due to traffic\r\ncongestion, he left the bus and rode a city cab to his apartment on\r\nNorth Beckley. He recalled that at the time of getting into the cab,\r\nsome lady looked in and asked the driver to call her a cab. He stated\r\nthat he might have made some remarks to the cab driver merely for the\r\npurpose of passing the time of day at that time. He recalled that his\r\nfare was approximately 85 cents. He stated that after arriving at\r\nhis apartment, he changed his shirt and trousers because they were\r\ndirty. He described his dirty clothes as being a reddish colored, long\r\nsleeved, shirt with a button-down collar and gray colored trousers.

He stated possibly one of these employees was called “Junior”\r\nand the other was a short individual whose name he could not recall\r\nbut whom he would be able to recognize. He stated that his lunch had\r\nconsisted of a cheese sandwich and an apple which he had obtained at\r\nMRS. RUTH PAINE’s residence in Irving, Texas, upon his leaving for work\r\nthat morning.\r\n\r\nOSWALD stated that MRS. PAINE receives no pay for keeping his wife\r\nand children at her residence. He stated that their presence in MRS.\r\nPAINE’s residence is a good arrangement for her because of her language\r\ninterest, indicating that his wife speaks Russian and MRS. PAINE is\r\ninterested in the Russian language.\r\n\r\nOSWALD denied having kept a rifle in MRS. PAINE’s garage at Irving,\r\nTexas, but stated that he did have certain articles stored in her\r\ngarage, consisting of two sea bags, a couple of suitcases, and several\r\nboxes of kitchen articles and also kept his clothes at MRS. PAINE’s\r\nresidence. He stated that all of the articles in MRS.

He stated that he does not know Attorney ABT\r\npersonally. Captain FRITZ advised OSWALD that arrangements would be\r\nimmediately made whereby he could call Attorney ABT.\r\n\r\nOSWALD stated that prior to coming to Dallas from New Orleans he had\r\nresided at a furnished apartment at 4706 Magazine Street, New Orleans,\r\nLouisiana. While in New Orleans, he had been employed by WILLIAM B.\r\nRILEY Company, 640 Magazine Street, New Orleans.\r\n\r\nOSWALD stated that he has nothing against President JOHN F.

KELLEY, U.S. SECRET SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST INTERVIEW OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD\r\n\r\nAt about 10:30 A.M., November 23, 1963, I attended my first interview\r\nwith Oswald. Present during the interview at the Homicide Division,\r\nDallas Police Department, were Special Agent Jim Bookhout, FBI; Captain\r\nWill Fritz, Homicide Division, Dallas Police Department; U.S. Marshal\r\nRobert Nash; SA David Grant and SAIC Sorrels; and Officers Boyd and\r\nHall of Captain Fritz’s detail. The interview was not recorded. Mr.\r\nSorrels and my presence was as observers, since Oswald was being held\r\nfor murder and his custody and interrogation at that time was the\r\nresponsibility of the Dallas Police Department.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions by Captain Fritz, Oswald said that immediately\r\nafter having left the building where he worked, he went by bus to the\r\ntheater where he was arrested; that when he got on the bus he secured\r\na transfer and thereafter transferred to other buses to get to his\r\ndestination. He denied that he brought a package to work on that day\r\nand he denied that he had ever had any conversation about curtain rods\r\nwith the boy named Wesley who drove him to his employment. Fritz asked\r\nhim if he had ridden a taxi that day and Oswald then changed his story\r\nand said that when he got on the bus he found it was going too slow and\r\nafter two blocks he got off the bus and took a cab to his home; that he\r\npassed the time with the cab driver and that the cab driver had told\r\nhim that the President was shot. He paid a cab fare of 85¢.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions, he stated that this was the first time he had\r\never ridden in a cab since a bus was always available. He said he went\r\nhome, changed his trousers and shirt, put his shirt in a drawer. This\r\nwas a red shirt, and he put it with his dirty clothes. He described the\r\nshirt as having a button down collar and of reddish color. The trousers\r\nwere grey colored.\r\n\r\nHe said he ate his lunch with the colored boys who worked with him. He\r\ndescribed one of them as “Junior”, a colored boy, and the other was a\r\nlittle short negro boy. He said his lunch consisted of cheese, bread,\r\nfruit, and apples, and was the only package he had with him when he\r\nwent to work.\r\n\r\nHe stated that Mrs. Paine practices Russian by having his wife live\r\nwith her. He denied that he had ever owned a rifle. He said he does not\r\nknow Mr. Paine very well but that Paine usually comes by the place\r\nwhere his wife was living with Mrs. Paine on Friday or Wednesday. He\r\nstated that Mr. Paine has a car and Mrs. Paine has had two cars. He\r\nsaid in response to questions by Captain Fritz that his effects were\r\nin Mrs. Paine’s garage and that they consisted of two sea bags with\r\nsome other packages containing his personal belongings and that he had\r\nbrought those back from New Orleans with him sometime in September.\r\nHe stated that his brother, Robert, lived at 7313 Davenport Street,\r\nFort Worth, and that the Paines were his closest friends in town. He\r\ndenied that he had ever joined the Communist party; that he never had a\r\nCommunist card. He did belong to the American Civil Liberties Union and\r\nhad paid $5 a year dues. He stated that he had bought the pistol that\r\nwas found in his possession when he was arrested about seven months\r\nago. He refused to answer any questions concerning the pistol or a gun\r\nuntil he talked to a lawyer.\r\n\r\nOswald stated that at various other times he had been thoroughly\r\ninterrogated by the FBI; that they had used all the usual interrogation\r\npractices and all their standard operating procedure; that he was very\r\nfamiliar with interrogation, and he had no intention of answering any\r\nquestions concerning any shooting; that he knew he did not have to\r\nanswer them and that he would not answer any questions until he had\r\nbeen given counsel. He stated that the FBI had used their hard and soft\r\napproach to him, they used the buddy system; that he was familiar with\r\nall types of questioning and had no intention of making any statements.\r\nHe said that in the past three weeks when the FBI had talked to his\r\nwife, they were abusive and impolite; that they had frightened his\r\nwife and he considered their activities obnoxious. He stated that\r\nhe wanted to contact a Mr. Abt, a New York lawyer whom he did not\r\nknow but who had defended the Smith Act “victims” in 1949 or 1950 in\r\nconnection with a conspiracy against the Government; that Abt would\r\nunderstand what this case was all about and that he would give him an\r\nexcellent defense. He stated in returning a question about his former\r\naddresses that he lived at 4907 Magazine Street in New Orleans at one\r\ntime and worked for the William Riley Company; that he was arrested in\r\nNew Orleans for disturbing the peace and paid a $10 fine while he was\r\ndemonstrating for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee; that he had a fight\r\nwith some anti-Castro refugees and that they were released while he was\r\nfined.\r\n\r\nUpon questioning by Captain Fritz, he said, “I have no views on the\r\nPresident.” “My wife and I like the President’s family. They are\r\ninteresting people. I have my own views on the President’s national\r\npolicy. I have a right to express my views but because of the charges\r\nI do not think I should comment further.” Oswald said, “I am not a\r\nmalcontent; nothing irritated me about the President.” He said that\r\nduring 1962 he was interviewed by the FBI and that he at that time\r\nrefused to take a polygraph and that he did not intend to take a\r\npolygraph test for the Dallas police. At this time Captain Fritz showed\r\na Selective Service Card that was taken out of his wallet which bore\r\nthe name of Alex Hidell. Oswald refused to discuss this after being\r\nasked for an explanation of it, both by Fritz and by James Bookhout,\r\nthe FBI Agent. I asked him if he viewed the parade and he said he had\r\nnot. I then asked him if he had shot the President and he said he had\r\nnot. I asked him if he had shot Governor Connally and he said he had\r\nnot. He did not intend to answer further questions without counsel\r\nand that if he could not get Abt, then he would hope that the Civil\r\nLiberties Union would give him an attorney to represent him. At that\r\npoint Captain Fritz terminated the interview at about 11:30 A.M.,\r\n11-23-63.\r\n\r\n          Thomas J.

Among those present at this interview were Inspector\r\nKelley, Captain Fritz, Detectives Senkel and Tiernon of the Homicide\r\nDivision and SA James Bookout, FBI. Captain Fritz conducted the\r\ninterview which was concerned mostly with Oswald’s place of residence\r\nin Dallas and was an attempt to ascertain where the bulk of Oswald’s\r\nbelongings were located in Dallas. As a result of the interview, Oswald\r\nfurnished information to Captain Fritz that most of his personal\r\neffects, including a sea bag, were in the garage at the address of Mrs.\r\nPaine, 2515 West 5th Street, Irving, Texas.\r\n\r\n    The interview was concluded about 1:10 P.M. and immediately\r\n    thereafter members of the Homicide Division secured a search\r\n    warrant and recovered Oswald’s effects from the home of Mrs.\r\n    Paine. Found among the effects were two different poses in\r\n    snapshot type photographs taken of Oswald holding a rifle in\r\n    one hand and holding up a copy of a paper called the _Militant_\r\n    and “The Worker” in the other hand. Oswald was wearing a\r\n    revolver in a holster on his right side. This photograph was\r\n    enlarged by the Dallas Police Laboratories and was used as a\r\n    basis of additional questioning of Oswald at approximately 6:00\r\n    P.M. that same evening.\r\n\r\nOn November 23, 1963, at 6:00 P.M., in the office of Captain Fritz,\r\nHomicide Division, Dallas Police Department, I was present at an\r\ninterview with Oswald. Also present were Captain Fritz, FBI Agent\r\nJim Bookhoutt, and four officers from the Homicide Division. This\r\ninterview was conducted with Oswald for the purpose of displaying to\r\nhim the blow-ups of photographs showing him holding a rifle and a\r\npistol which were seized as a result of the search warrant for the\r\ngarage of Mrs. Paine at 2515 West 5th Street, Irving, Texas. When the\r\nphotographs were presented to Oswald, he sneered at them saying that\r\nthey were fake photographs; that he had been photographed a number\r\nof times the day before by the police and apparently after they\r\nphotographed him they superimposed on the photographs a rifle and put\r\na gun in his pocket. He got into a long argument with Captain Fritz\r\nabout his knowledge of photography and asked Fritz a number of times\r\nwhether the smaller photograph was made from the larger or whether the\r\nlarger photograph was made from the smaller. He said at the proper\r\ntime he would show that the photographs were fakes. Fritz told him\r\nthat the smaller photograph was taken from his effects at the garage.\r\nOswald became arrogant and refused to answer any further questions\r\nconcerning the photographs and would not identify the photographs as\r\nbeing a photograph of himself. Captain Fritz displayed great patience\r\nand tenacity in attempting to secure from Oswald the location of what\r\napparently is the backyard of an address at which Oswald formerly\r\nlived, but it was apparent that Oswald, though slightly shaken by the\r\nevidence, had no intention of furnishing any information.\r\n\r\nThe interview was terminated at about 7:15 P.M.\r\n\r\n          Thomas J. Kelley\r\n          Inspector\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n            CO-2-34,030\r\n\r\n  U. S. Secret Service\r\n\r\n            November 29, 1963\r\n\r\n  Chief Inspector Kelley\r\n\r\nPreliminary Special Dallas Report # 3\r\n\r\nCovers third interview with Oswald and circumstances immediately\r\nfollowing his murder\r\n\r\nThis interview started at approximately 9:30 AM on Sunday, November\r\n24, 1963. The interview was conducted in the office of Captain Will\r\nFritz of the Homicide Bureau, Dallas Police. Present at the interview\r\nin addition to Oswald were Captain Fritz, Postal Inspector Holmes,\r\nSAIC Sorrels, Inspector Kelley and four members of the Homicide Squad.\r\nThe interview had just begun when I arrived and Captain Fritz was\r\nagain requesting Oswald to identify the place where the photograph of\r\nhim holding the gun was taken. Captain Fritz indicated that it would\r\nsave the Police a great deal of time if he would tell them where the\r\nplace was located. Oswald refused to discuss the matter. Captain Fritz\r\nasked, “Are you a Communist?” Oswald answered, “No, I am a Marxist\r\nbut I am not a Marxist Leninist”. Captain Fritz asked him what the\r\ndifference was and Oswald said it would take too long to explain it to\r\nhim. Oswald said that he became interested in the Fair Play for Cuba\r\nCommittee while he was in New Orleans; that he wrote to the Committee’s\r\nHeadquarters in New York and received some Committee literature and a\r\nletter signed by Alex Hidell. He stated that he began to distribute\r\nthat literature in New Orleans and it was at that time that he got into\r\nan altercation with a group and he was arrested. He said his opinions\r\nconcerning Fair Play for Cuba are well known; that he appeared on Bill\r\nStukey’s television program in New Orleans on a number of occasions and\r\nwas interviewed by the local press often. He denies knowing or ever\r\nseeing Hidell in New Orleans, said he believed in all of the tenets\r\nof the Fair Play for Cuba and the things which the Fair Play for Cuba\r\nCommittee stood for which was free intercourse with Cuba and freedom\r\nfor tourists of the both countries to travel within each other’s\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, Oswald said that Cuba should have ~folded~ full\r\ndiplomatic relationship with the United States. I asked him if he\r\nthought that the President’s assassination would have any effect on\r\nthe Fair Play for Cuba Committee. He said there would be no change in\r\nthe attitude of the American people toward Cuba with President Johnson\r\nbecoming President because they both belonged to the same political\r\nparty and the one would follow pretty generally the policies of the\r\nother. He stated that he is an avid reader of Russian literature\r\nwhether it is communistic or not; that he subscribes to “The Militant”,\r\nwhich, he says, is the weekly of the Socialist party in the United\r\nStates (it is a copy of “The Militant” that Oswald is shown holding in\r\nthe photograph taken from his effects at Irving Street). At that time\r\nhe asked me whether I was an FBI Agent and I said that I was not that\r\nI was a member of the Secret Service. He said when he was standing in\r\nfront of the Textbook Building and about to leave it, a young crew-cut\r\nman rushed up to him and said he was from the Secret Service, showed a\r\nbook of identification, and asked him where the phone was. Oswald said\r\nhe pointed toward the pay phone in the building and that he saw the man\r\nactually go to the phone before he left.\r\n\r\nI asked Oswald whether as a Marxist he believed that religion was an\r\nopiate of the people and he said very definitely so that all organized\r\nreligions tend to become monopolistic and are the causes of a great\r\ndeal of class warfare. I asked him whether he considered the Catholic\r\nChurch to be an enemy of the Communist philosophy and he said well,\r\nthere was no Catholicism in Russia; that the closest to it is the\r\nOrthodox Churches but he said he would not further discuss his opinions\r\nof religion since this was an attempt to have him say something which\r\ncould be construed as being anti-religious or anti Catholic.\r\n\r\nCapt. Fritz displayed an Enco street map of Dallas which had been found\r\namong Oswald’s effects at the rooming house. Oswald was asked whether\r\nthe map was his and whether he had put some marks on it. He said it\r\nwas his and remarked “My God don’t tell me there’s a mark near where\r\nthis thing happened”. The mark was pointed out to him and he said “What\r\nabout the other marks on the map?--I put a number of marks on it. I was\r\nlooking for work and marked the places where I went for jobs or where I\r\nheard there were jobs”.\r\n\r\nSince it was obvious to Captain Fritz that Oswald was not going to be\r\ncooperative, he terminated the interview at that time.\r\n\r\nI approached Oswald then and, out of the hearing of the others except\r\nperhaps one of Captain Fritz’s men, said that as a Secret Service\r\nagent, we are anxious to talk with him as soon as he had secured\r\ncounsel; that we were responsible for the safety of the President;\r\nthat the Dallas Police had charged him with the assassination of the\r\nPresident but that he had denied it; we were therefore very anxious to\r\ntalk with him to make certain that the correct story was developing\r\nas it related to the assassination. He said that he would be glad to\r\ndiscuss this proposition with his attorney and that after he talked\r\nto one, we could either discuss it with him or discuss it with his\r\nattorney, if the attorney thought it was the wise thing to do, but\r\nthat at the present time he had nothing more to say to me. Oswald was\r\nthen handed some different clothing to put on. The clothing included a\r\nsweater. Captain Fritz made a number of telephone calls to ascertain\r\nwhether the preparations he had placed into effect for transferring\r\nthe prisoner to the County Jail were ready and upon being so advised,\r\nCaptain Fritz and members of the Detective Bureau escorted Oswald from\r\nthe Homicide Office on the third floor to the basement where Oswald was\r\nshot by Jack Ruby.\r\n\r\nOn the completion of the interview, SAIC Sorrels and I proceeded to the\r\noffice of the Chief of Police on the third floor and were discussing\r\nthe interview when we heard that Oswald had been shot. We both ran\r\ndown the steps to the basement. I arrived in the ante-room where they\r\nhad dragged Oswald. SAIC Sorrels located and interviewed Ruby. Someone\r\nwas bending over Oswald with a stethoscope and he appeared to be\r\nunconscious in very serious condition at that time. I asked Captain\r\nFritz what had happened and he said Oswald had been shot by one Jack\r\n“Rubio” whom the police knew as a tavern operator. Shortly thereafter\r\na stretcher arrived and I accompanied the stretcher to the ambulance\r\nwhich had been hastily backed into the garage. I observed that during\r\nthe transfer that Oswald was unconscious; when the ambulance drove\r\naway from the building, I attempted to board a cruiser that apparently\r\nwas going to follow the ambulance but I was unable to get into the\r\ncar before it pulled away. Special Agents Warner and Patterson had\r\nheard of the shooting on their radio, proceeded to Parkland Hospital\r\nwhere Oswald was being taken and arrived vary shortly after Oswald\r\nhad arrived at the emergency entrance and was being taken into the\r\nemergency treatment room. One or the other of these agents was in close\r\nproximity to Oswald while he was being treated. When I arrived at\r\nthe hospital, I rode up on the elevator with Dr. Shaw who had looked\r\nat Oswald as he had come in and was being recalled to the operating\r\nroom where Oswald had been taken. While Oswald was in the operating\r\nroom, no one other than medical personnel was present but a Dallas\r\npoliceman who had accompanied Oswald in the ambulance was standing in\r\nthe doorway of the operating room in operating room scrub clothes. No\r\nother investigating personnel were in the vicinity. In the immediate\r\nvicinity of the detective was Special Agent Warner. Oswald made no\r\nstatements from the time he was shot until the time of his death.\r\nHe was unconscious during the ambulance run to the hospital which I\r\nverified through Detective Daugherty, who accompanied him. He did not\r\nregain consciousness at any time during the treatment until he died. At\r\nthe time of his death, myself, Detective Daugherty and Colonel Garrison\r\nof the Texas State Police were on the fifth floor of the hospital\r\narranging a security room in which to take Oswald, in the event he\r\nsurvived the operating room treatment. It was never necessary to use\r\nthis room and upon learning of his death, I proceeded to the morgue\r\nto arrange for his family to view the body. When the family heard of\r\nthe death they were in the process of being interviewed by Special\r\nAgents Kunkel and Howard, and requested to be brought to the hospital.\r\nOswald’s brother, Robert, who had also come to the hospital, was being\r\ninterviewed by Special Agent Howlett. Before the post mortem was\r\nperformed, Oswald’s family, with the exception of Robert, viewed the\r\nbody. Robert arrived too late to view the body before the autopsy had\r\nstarted and was not permitted by hospital authorities to view the body.\r\nThe family was accompanied during the viewing by the hospital chaplain.\r\n\r\nAfter making arrangements through the chaplain and another clergyman\r\nfor the burial of the body, the family was returned to a secluded spot\r\nunder the protection of Special Agents Kunkel and Howard, and the\r\nIrving Texas police. Precaution was taken to insure their safety in\r\nview of the excitement caused by the killing of Oswald. Special Agents\r\nHoward and Kunkel did an excellent job in handling the security of this\r\nfamily detail and insuring their safety. Thereafter, I was called by\r\nSAIC Bouck who advised me that the President and the Attorney General\r\nwere concerned about the safety of this family and instructed that all\r\nprecautions should be taken to insure that no harm befell them. SAIC\r\nBouck was advised that the family was presently under our protection;\r\nwe would continue providing protection until further notice.\r\n\r\nLater that same day, I was contacted by SA Robertson of the FBI who\r\nasked whether we had someone with the family. He was assured that we\r\nhad. He requested to be advised where the family had been taken. Since\r\ntheir ultimate destination was unknown to me at the time, I assured\r\nhim that when I learned of their whereabouts I would relay it to him.\r\nHe said that they received instructions from the Attorney General and\r\nPresident Johnson that precaution should be taken to insure the family\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nAt 11 pm, Sunday, November 24th, I was advised of the location of the\r\nfamily and immediately notified Robertson and inquired whether they\r\nnow wished to take over their protection. He said no they had no such\r\ninstructions, they merely wished to be assured that someone was looking\r\nout for their safety. I assured them that adequate protection was being\r\nprovided and that they were available for interviews by the FBI. He\r\nstated that they did not wish to interview the family at this time;\r\nthat they merely wanted to make sure they were in safe hands.\r\n\r\n  TJK:VS\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF U.S. POSTAL INSPECTOR H. D. HOLMES\r\n\r\nDallas, Texas\r\n\r\n            December 17, 1963\r\n\r\n\r\n_MEMORANDUM OF INTERVIEW_\r\n\r\nInformal memorandum furnished by Postal Inspector H. D. Holmes, Dallas,\r\nTexas, of an interview he took part in with Lee H. Oswald on Sunday\r\nmorning, November 24, 1963, between the approximate hours of 9:25 a.m.\r\nto 11:10 a.m. Those present, in addition to Inspector Holmes, were\r\nCaptain Will Fritz, Dallas Police, Forrest V. Sorrels, Local Agent in\r\nCharge, Secret Service, and Thomas J. Kelly, Inspector, Secret Service.\r\nIn addition, there were three Detectives who were apparently assigned\r\nto guarding Oswald as none of them took part in the interrogation.\r\n\r\nOswald at no time appeared confused or in doubt as to whether or not\r\nhe should answer a question. On the contrary, he was quite alert and\r\nshowed no hesitancy in answering those questions which he wanted to\r\nanswer, and was quite skillful in parrying those questions which he did\r\nnot want to answer. I got the impression that he had disciplined his\r\nmind and reflexes to a state where I personally doubted if he would\r\never have confessed. He denied, emphatically, having taken part in or\r\nhaving had any knowledge of the shooting of the policeman Tippitt or of\r\nthe President, stating that so far as he is concerned the reason he was\r\nin custody was because he “popped a policeman in the nose in a theater\r\non Jefferson Avenue.”\r\n\r\nP. O. BOXES--He was questioned separately about the three boxes he\r\nhad rented, and in each instance his answers were quick, direct and\r\naccurate as reflected on the box rental applications. He stated without\r\nprompting that he had rented Box 2915 at the Main Post Office for\r\nseveral months prior to his going to New Orleans, that this box was\r\nrented in his own name, Lee H. Oswald, and that he had taken out two\r\nkeys to the box, and that when he had closed the box, he directed that\r\nhis mail be forwarded to him at his street address in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nHe stated that no one received mail in this box other than himself, nor\r\ndid he receive any mail under any other name than his own true name;\r\nthat no one had access to the box other than himself nor did he permit\r\nanyone else to use this box. He stated it was possible that on rare\r\noccasions he may have handed one of the keys to his wife to go get his\r\nmail but certainly nobody else. He denied emphatically that he ever\r\nordered a rifle under his name or any other name, nor permitted anyone\r\nelse to order a rifle to be received in this box. Further, he denied\r\nthat he had ever ordered any rifle by mail order or bought any money\r\norder for the purpose of paying for such a rifle. In fact, he claimed\r\nhe owned no rifle and had not practiced or shot a rifle other than\r\npossibly a .22, small bore rifle, since his days with the Marine Corp.\r\nHe stated that “How could I afford to order a rifle on my salary of\r\n$1.25 an hour when I can’t hardly feed myself on what I make.”\r\n\r\nWhen asked if he had a post office box in New Orleans he stated that\r\nhe did, for the reason that he subscribed to several publications, at\r\nleast two of which were published in Russia, one being the hometown\r\npaper published in Minsk where he met and married his wife, and that\r\nhe moved around so much that it was more practical to simply rent post\r\noffice boxes and have his mail forwarded from one box to the next\r\nrather than going through the process of furnishing changes of address\r\nto the publishers. When asked if he permitted anyone other than himself\r\nto get mail in box 30061 at New Orleans, he stated that he did not. It\r\nwill be recalled that on this box rent application he showed that both\r\nMarina Oswald and A. J. Hidell were listed under the caption “Persons\r\nentitled to receive mail through box”. After denying that anyone\r\nelse was permitted to get mail in the box, he was reminded that this\r\napplication showed the name Marina Oswald as being entitled to receive\r\nmail in the box and he replied “well so what, she was my wife and I see\r\nnothing wrong with that, and it could very well be that I did place her\r\nname on the application”. He was then reminded that the application\r\nalso showed the name A. J. Hidell was also entitled to receive mail in\r\nthe box, at which he simply shrugged his shoulders and stated “I don’t\r\nrecall anything about that”.\r\n\r\nHe stated that when he came back to Dallas and after he had gone to\r\nwork for the Texas School Book Depository, he had rented a box at the\r\nnearby Terminal Annex postal station, this being Box 6225, and that\r\nthis box was also rented in his name, Lee H. Oswald. He stated he had\r\nonly checked out one key for this box, which information was found\r\nto be accurate, and this key was found on his person at the time of\r\nhis arrest. He professed not to recall the fact that he showed on the\r\nbox rental application under name of corporation “Fair Play For Cuba\r\nCommittee” and “American Civil Liberties Union”. When asked as to why\r\nhe showed these organizations on the application, he simply shrugged\r\nand said that he didn’t recall showing them. When asked if he paid the\r\nbox rental fee or did the organizations pay it, he stated that he paid\r\nit. In answer to another question, he also stated that no one had any\r\nknowledge that he had this box other than himself.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATIONS- MEMBERSHIP IN--With respect to American Civil Liberties\r\nUnion he was a little evasive stating something to the effect that\r\nhe had made some effort to join but it was never made clear whether\r\nhe had or had not been accepted. He stated that he first became\r\ninterested in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, after he went to New\r\nOrleans, that it started out as being a group of individuals who, like\r\nhim, who thought and had like political opinions. They did decide to\r\norganize, and did organize after a fashion, but denied that they had\r\nany president or any elected officers. He stated that he, himself,\r\ncould probably be considered the secretary since he wrote some letters\r\non their behalf and attempted to collect dues which, if I recall, were\r\n$1.00 per month. He also stated that there was a “Fair Play for Cuba\r\nCommittee” in New York which was better organized. He denied that he\r\nwas sent to Dallas for the purpose of organizing such a cell in Dallas.\r\n\r\nWhen asked if he was a communist, he stated emphatically not, that\r\nhe was a Marxist. Someone asked the difference and he stated that a\r\ncommunist is a Lenin-Marxist, that he himself was a pure Marxist, and\r\nwhen someone asked the difference, he stated that it was a long story\r\nand if they didn’t know, it would take too long to tell them. He stated\r\nfurther that he had read about everything written by or about Karl Marx.\r\n\r\nWhen asked as to his religion, he stated that Karl Marx was his\r\nreligion, and in response to further questioning he stated that some\r\npeople may find the Bible interesting reading, but it was not for him,\r\nstating further that even as a philosophy there was not much to the\r\nBible.\r\n\r\nMARINE CORP SERVICE--Captain Fritz made some mention of his\r\ndishonorable discharge from the Marine Corp at which point he bristled\r\nnoticeably, stating that he had been discharged with an “honorable”\r\ndischarge and that this was later changed due to his having attempted\r\nto denounce his American Citizenship while he was living in Russia. He\r\nstated further that since his change of citizenship did not come to\r\npass, he had written a letter to Mr. Connally, then Secretary of the\r\nNavy, and after considerable delay, received a very respectful reply\r\nwherein Connally stated he had resigned to run for Governor of Texas,\r\nand that his letter was being referred to the new Secretary, a Mr.\r\nCork, Kurth, or something like that. He showed no particular animosity\r\ntoward Mr. Connally while discussing this feature.\r\n\r\nMAP--Captain Fritz advised him that among his effects in his room,\r\nthere was found a map of the City of Dallas that had some marks on\r\nit and asked him to explain this map. Oswald said he presumed he had\r\nreference to an old City map which he had on which he had made some\r\nX’s denoting location of firms that had advertised job vacancies. He\r\nstated that he had no transportation and either walked or rode a bus\r\nand that as he was constantly looking for work, in fact had registered\r\nfor employment at the Texas Employment Bureau, and that as he would\r\nreceive leads either from newspaper ads or from the Bureau or from\r\nneighbors, he would chart these places on the map to save time in his\r\ntraveling. He said to the best of his recollection, most of them were\r\nout Industrial, presumably meaning Industrial Blvd. When asked as to\r\nwhy the X at the location of the Texas School Book Depository at Elm\r\nand Houston, he stated that “Well, I interviewed there for a job, in\r\nfact, got the job, therefore the X”.\r\n\r\nWhen asked as to how he learned about this vacancy, he stated that “Oh,\r\nit was general information in the neighborhood, I don’t recall just\r\nwho told me about it, but I learned it from people in Mrs. Paynes’\r\nneighborhood” and that all the people around there were looking out for\r\npossible employment for him.\r\n\r\nACTIVITY JUST PRIOR TO AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING ASSASSINATION\r\nATTEMPT--To an inquiry as to why he went to visit his wife on Thursday\r\nnight, November 21, whereas he normally visited her over the weekend,\r\nhe stated that on this particular weekend he had learned that his wife\r\nand Mrs. Payne were giving a party for the children and that they were\r\nhaving in a “houseful” of neighborhood children and that he just didn’t\r\nwant to be around at such a time. Therefore, he made his weekly visit\r\non Thursday night.\r\n\r\nWhen asked if he didn’t bring a sack with him the next morning to work,\r\nhe stated that he did, and when asked as to the contents of the sack,\r\nhe stated that it contained his lunch. Then, when asked as to the size\r\nor shape of the sack, he said “Oh, I don’t recall, it may have a small\r\nsack or a large sack, you don’t always find one that just fits your\r\nsandwiches.” When asked as to where he placed the sack when he got in\r\nthe car, he said in his lap, or possibly the front seat beside him, as\r\nhe always did because he didn’t want to get it crushed. He denied that\r\nhe placed any package in the back seat. When advised that the driver\r\nstated that he had brought out a long parcel and placed it in the back\r\nseat, he stated “Oh, he must be mistaken or else thinking about some\r\nother time when he picked me up.”\r\n\r\nWhen asked as to his whereabouts at the time of the shooting, he stated\r\nthat when lunch time came, and he didn’t say which floor he was on, he\r\nsaid one of the Negro employees invited him to eat lunch with him and\r\nhe stated “You go on down and send the elevator back up and I will join\r\nyou in a few minutes.” Before he could finish whatever he was doing,\r\nhe stated, the commotion surrounding the assassination took place\r\nand when he went down stairs, a policeman questioned him as to his\r\nidentification and his boss stated that “he is one of our employees”\r\nwhereupon the policeman had him step aside momentarily. Following this,\r\nhe simply walked out the front door of the building. I don’t recall\r\nthat anyone asked why he left or where or how he went. I just presumed\r\nthat this had been covered in an earlier questioning.\r\n\r\nA. J. HIDELL IDENTIFICATION CARD--Captain Fritz asked him if he knew\r\nanyone by the name of A. J. Hidell and he denied that he did. When\r\nasked if he had ever used this name as an alias, he also made a denial.\r\nIn fact, he stated that he had never used the name, didn’t know anyone\r\nby this name, and never had heard of the name before. Captain Fritz\r\nthen asked him about the I.D. card he had in his pocket bearing such a\r\nname and he flared up and stated “I’ve told you all I’m going to about\r\nthat card. You took notes, just read them for yourself, if you want to\r\nrefresh your memory.” He told Captain Fritz that “You have the card.\r\nNow you know as much about it as I do.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout 11:00 a.m. or a few minutes thereafter, someone handed through\r\nthe door several hangers on which there were some trousers, shirts,\r\nand a couple of sweaters. When asked if he wanted to change any of his\r\nclothes before being transferred to the County jail, he said “Just give\r\nme one of these sweaters.” He didn’t like the one they handed him and\r\ninsisted on putting on a black slip-over sweater than had some jagged\r\nholes in it near the front of the right shoulder. One cuff was released\r\nwhile he slipped this over the head, following which he was again\r\ncuffed. During this change of clothing, Chief of Police Curry came into\r\nthe room and discussed something in an inaudible undertone with Captain\r\nFritz, apparently for the purpose of not letting Oswald hear what\r\nwas being said. I have no idea what this conversation was, but just\r\npresume they were discussing the transfer of the prisoner. I did not go\r\ndownstairs to witness the further transfer of the prisoner.\r\n\r\n          H. D. HOLMES\r\n          Postal Inspector\r\n          Dallas 22, Texas\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XII\r\n\r\nSpeculations and Rumors\r\n\r\n\r\nMyths have traditionally surrounded the dramatic assassinations of\r\nhistory. The rumors and theories about the assassination of Abraham\r\nLincoln that are still being publicized were for the most part first\r\nbruited within months of his death. Wherever there is any element\r\nof mystery in such dramatic events misconceptions often result from\r\nsensational speculations.\r\n\r\nLacking the testimony of Lee Harvey Oswald, it has been necessary to\r\nreconstruct painstakingly all of the facts that led the Commission to\r\nthe conclusion that Oswald assassinated President Kennedy, acting alone\r\nand without advice or assistance. The Commission has found no credible\r\nevidence that he was a member of a foreign or domestic conspiracy of\r\nany kind. Nor was there any evidence that he was involved with any\r\ncriminal or underworld elements or that he had any association with his\r\nslayer, Jack Ruby, except as his victim. The evidence on these issues\r\nhas been set forth in great detail in this report.\r\n\r\nIn addition the Commission has inquired into the various hypotheses,\r\nrumors, and speculations that have arisen from the tragic developments\r\nof November 22-24, 1963. It is recognized that the public judgment of\r\nthese events has been influenced, at least to some extent, by these\r\nconjectures.\r\n\r\nMany questions have been raised about the facts out of genuine\r\npuzzlement or because of misinformation which attended some of the\r\nearly reporting of the fast-crowding events of these 3 days. Most of\r\nthe speculation and attempted reconstruction of these events by the\r\npublic centered on these basic questions: Was Lee Harvey Oswald really\r\nthe assassin of the President; why did he do it; did he have any\r\naccomplices; and why did Ruby shoot Oswald? Many of the theories and\r\nhypotheses advanced have rested on premises which the Commission feels\r\ndeserve critical examination.\r\n\r\nMany people who witnessed the assassination and the killing of Oswald\r\nor were present in the area were a major source of diverse and often\r\ncontradictory information. As is easily understood under such\r\ncircumstances, all of the witnesses did not see and hear the same thing\r\nor interpret what they saw and heard the same way and many changed\r\ntheir stories as they repeated them. Moreover, they were interviewed\r\nat different times after the event by different people and often under\r\ncircumstances which made accurate reporting extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nEven the occupants of the cars in the Presidential motorcade were not\r\nentirely in agreement in their accounts because they, too, saw and\r\nheard what happened from different positions. Moreover, those closest\r\nto the assassination were subjected to a physical and emotional strain\r\nthat tended to affect their recollections of what they thought they\r\nsaw or heard. Consequently, the presentation of the news from Dallas\r\nincluded much misinformation. This, to some extent, was unavoidable,\r\nbut the widespread and repetitive dissemination of every scrap of\r\ninformation about the President’s assassination and its aftermath\r\nhas helped to build up a large number of erroneous conclusions. The\r\nmanner in which local authorities released information about the\r\ninvestigation, sometimes before it could be verified in all detail, has\r\nfurther contributed to the fund of ill-founded theories. Typographical\r\nmistakes in the press and failure to transcribe sound accurately from\r\ntapes resulted in errors, some of which have remained uncorrected in\r\nprint at the time of the publication of this report.\r\n\r\nMuch of the speculation that has persisted in one form or another since\r\nNovember 22-24 came from people who usually spoke in good faith. Some\r\nof the errors have resulted simply from a lack of complete knowledge at\r\nthe time of the event. In this category are the statements attributed\r\nto doctors at Parkland Memorial Hospital who attended the dying\r\nPresident and described his wounds to the press afterward. It remained\r\nfor the autopsy in Washington, completed early the next morning, to\r\nascertain the full facts concerning the wounds. The correction of\r\nearlier assertions of fact on the basis of later and fuller analysis\r\nor investigation is a normal part of the process of accumulation of\r\nevidence. But it is not often that the process is conducted in such\r\nan intense glare of worldwide publicity, and later corrections have\r\ndifficulty overtaking the original sensational reports.\r\n\r\nThere is still another category of speculation and rumor that\r\ncomplicated and broadened the work of the Commission. Numerous people\r\nclaimed to have seen Oswald or Ruby at various times and places in\r\nthe United States or abroad. Others insisted that during the days\r\nfollowing the assassination, they had detected significant actions on\r\ntelevision that were witnessed by no one else. Still others assumed\r\nfrom a widely published picture that Oswald was standing on the steps\r\nof the entrance to the Texas School Book Depository at the time the\r\nPresident was shot. Throughout the country people reported overheard\r\nremarks, conversations, threats, prophesies, and opinions that seemed\r\nto them to have a possible bearing on the assassination. More than a\r\nfew informants initially told their speculations or professed firsthand\r\ninformation to newspaper and television reporters. Later, many of\r\nthem changed or retracted their stories in telling them to official\r\ninvestigators.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. investigative agencies expended much valuable time and effort\r\ninquiring into these leads. Investigations of a vast number of rumors\r\nand speculations reached into almost every part of the United States\r\nand to most of the other continents of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Commission’s work was also handicapped by those witnesses and other\r\npersons connected with the investigation who sold for publication\r\nevidence pertinent to the investigation. These persons sold pictures\r\nand documents and even recollections, sometimes before the Commission\r\nhad an opportunity to receive their evidence. Some of the evidence\r\nthus published was changed from its original form and gave misleading\r\nimpressions to the public. The piecemeal release of this evidence,\r\nsometimes in distorted or exaggerated form, and often out of context,\r\nprovided the basis for new speculations and rumors or served to\r\nreinforce already current ones. The practice was frequently harmful to\r\nthe work of the Commission and a disservice to the public.\r\n\r\nThis appendix is intended to clarify the most widespread factual\r\nmisunderstandings. False or inaccurate speculations concerning the\r\nassassination and related events are set forth below together with\r\nbrief summary statements of what the Commission has found to be the\r\ntrue facts. The citation following each Commission finding is either\r\nto that portion of the report in which the subject is discussed more\r\nfully, to the evidence in the record supporting the finding, or to\r\nboth. For complete answers to these speculations, the sources cited\r\nin the footnotes should be consulted. The speculations are considered\r\nunder the following headings:\r\n\r\n  1. The source of the shots.\r\n  2. The identity of the assassin.\r\n  3. Oswald’s movements between 12:33 and 1:15 p.m. on November 22, 1963.\r\n  4. The murder of Patrolman Tippit.\r\n  5. Oswald after his arrest.\r\n  6. Oswald in the Soviet Union.\r\n  7. Oswald’s trip to Mexico City.\r\n  8. Oswald and U.S. Government agencies.\r\n  9. Conspiratorial relationships.\r\n 10. Miscellaneous charges.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOURCE OF THE SHOTS\r\n\r\nThere have been speculations that some or all of the shots aimed at\r\nPresident Kennedy and Governor Connally came from the railroad overpass\r\nas the Presidential automobile approached it, or from somewhere other\r\nthan the Texas School Book Depository Building. Related speculations\r\nmaintain that the shots came from both the railroad overpass and the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building. These are supported by a number\r\nof assertions that have been carefully examined by the Commission\r\nin the course of its investigation and rejected as being without\r\nfoundation. They are set forth below, together with the results of the\r\nCommission’s investigation.\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The shots that killed the President came from the\r\nrailroad overpass above the triple underpass.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The shots that entered the neck and head of the\r\nPresident and wounded Governor Connally came from behind and above.\r\nThere is no evidence that any shots were fired at the President from\r\nanywhere other than the Texas School Book Depository Building.[A12-1]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The railroad overpass was left unguarded on November 22.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--On November 22 the railroad overpass was guarded\r\nby two Dallas policemen, Patrolmen J. W. Foster and J. C. White, who\r\nhave testified that they permitted only railroad personnel on the\r\noverpass.[A12-2]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--There are witnesses who alleged that the shots came\r\nfrom the overpass.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The Commission does not have knowledge of\r\nany witnesses who saw shots fired from the overpass. Statements or\r\ndepositions from the 2 policemen and 13 railroad employees who were on\r\nthe overpass all affirm that no shots were fired from the overpass.\r\nMost of these witnesses who discussed the source of the shots stated\r\nthat they came from the direction of Elm and Houston Streets.[A12-3]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--A rifle cartridge was recovered on the overpass.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--No cartridge of any kind was found on the\r\noverpass nor has any witness come forward to claim having found\r\none.[A12-4]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--A witness to the assassination said that she saw a man\r\nrun behind the concrete wall of the overpass and disappear.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Mrs. Jean L. Hill stated that after the firing\r\nstopped she saw a white man wearing a brown overcoat and a hat running\r\nwest away from the Depository Building in the direction of the railroad\r\ntracks. There are no other witnesses who claim to have seen a man\r\nrunning toward the railroad tracks. Examination of all available\r\nfilms of the area following the shooting, reexamination of interviews\r\nwith individuals in the vicinity of the shooting, and interviews with\r\nmembers of the Dallas Police Department and the Dallas County sheriff’s\r\noffice failed to corroborate Mrs. Hill’s recollection or to reveal the\r\nidentity of the man described by Mrs. Hill.[A12-5]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Immediately after the shooting a motorcycle policeman\r\nwas seen racing up the grassy embankment to the right of the shooting\r\nscene pursuing a couple seeking to flee from the overpass.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--There are no witnesses who have ever stated this\r\nand there is no evidence to support the claim. A motorcycle policeman,\r\nClyde A. Haygood, dismounted in the street and ran up the incline. He\r\nstated that he saw no one running from the railroad yards adjacent to\r\nthe overpass. Subsequently, at 12:37 p.m., Haygood reported that the\r\nshots had come from the Texas School Book Depository Building.[A12-6]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--More than three shots, perhaps as many as five or six,\r\nwere fired at the President and Governor Connally.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The weight of the evidence indicates that three\r\nshots were fired, of which two struck President Kennedy. There is\r\npersuasive evidence from the experts that one of these two bullets also\r\nstruck Governor Connally. Some witnesses claimed that they heard more\r\nthan three shots but, as fully described in chapter III, the great\r\nmajority heard only three shots.[A12-7]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--At least four or five bullets have been found.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--After the assassination, metal remains of\r\nbullets were recovered. These included an almost whole bullet of 158.6\r\ngrains, fragments weighing 44.6 grains and 21.0 grains, and other\r\nfragments too small to be identified. These metal remains indicate that\r\nat least two shots were fired. The Commission believes that three shots\r\nwere fired.[A12-8]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--A bullet was found on the stretcher used for President\r\nKennedy at Parkland Hospital.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--No bullet was found on the stretcher used by\r\nPresident Kennedy. An almost whole bullet was found when it rolled off\r\nthe stretcher used by Governor Connally.[A12-9]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--A bullet was found in the grass near the scene of the\r\nassassination shortly afterward by a deputy sheriff of Dallas County,\r\nE. R. Walthers.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Walthers has denied that he found a bullet at\r\nany time or that he told anyone that he had found one. With another\r\ndeputy sheriff he made a diligent search for such a bullet 2 or 3 days\r\nafter the assassination.[A12-10]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The Presidential car stopped momentarily or almost came\r\nto a complete halt after the first shot. This is evidence that the\r\ndriver had the impression that the first shot came from the front and\r\ntherefore hesitated to drive closer to the overpass.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The Presidential car did not stop or almost come\r\nto a complete halt after the firing of the first shot or any other\r\nshots. The driver, Special Agent William E. Greer, has testified that\r\nhe accelerated the car after what was probably the second shot. Motion\r\npictures of the scene show that the car slowed down momentarily after\r\nthe shot that struck the President in the head and then speeded up\r\nrapidly.[A12-11]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The Presidential car had a small round bullet hole in\r\nthe front windshield. This is evidence that a shot or shots were fired\r\nat the President from the front of the car.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The windshield was not penetrated by any\r\nbullet. A small residue of lead was found on the inside surface of the\r\nwindshield; on the outside of the windshield was a very small pattern\r\nof cracks immediately in front of the lead residue on the inside. The\r\nbullet from which this lead residue came was probably one of those\r\nthat struck the President and therefore came from overhead and to the\r\nrear. Experts established that the abrasion in the windshield came from\r\nimpact on the inside of the glass.[A12-12]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The throat wound sustained by the President was the\r\nresult of a shot fired from the front according to doctors at Parkland\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Doctors at Parkland Hospital originally believed\r\nthat the throat wound could have been either an entry or exit wound,\r\nbut they made no examination to determine entry and exit wounds.\r\nSubsequently, when the evidence of the autopsy became available, the\r\ndoctors at Parkland agreed that it was an exit wound.[A12-13]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--It is inconceivable that the doctors at Parkland\r\nHospital did not turn the President over on his face and notice the\r\nbullet hole in the back of his neck.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Doctors at Parkland Hospital have testified that\r\nthe President remained on his back while he was at Parkland Hospital\r\nfor treatment and that they did not turn him over at any time; they\r\nwere busy trying to save his life. Consequently, they were never aware\r\nof the hole in the back of his neck until they were notified of it\r\nlater.[A12-14]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The first shot struck the President in the throat as\r\nthe car was proceeding along Houston Street toward the Texas School\r\nBook Depository. The car then made a left turn on to Elm Street and\r\nproceeded for some distance before additional shots were fired at the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Before the autopsy findings made it clear that\r\nthe shots were fired from the rear, there was speculation that the\r\nfirst shot may have been fired before the Presidential car turned on\r\nto Elm Street. As this report demonstrates, all of the shots that\r\nstruck the President were fired from the rear and in a time period\r\ninconsistent with the theory that the first shot struck him while his\r\ncar was coming down Houston Street. Motion pictures taken at the time\r\nshow that the first shot struck the President after the car had turned\r\nonto Elm Street and was proceeding away from the Depository.[A12-15]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASSASSIN\r\n\r\nSpeculations tending to support the theory that Oswald could not\r\nhave assassinated President Kennedy are based on a wide variety of\r\nassertions. Among these are statements that Oswald could not have been\r\nacquainted with the motorcade route before he came to work on November\r\n22, that he may well have carried curtain rods rather than a rifle in\r\na brown paper package he brought with him, that there may have been\r\nother people in the building who could have fired the rifle, that\r\nOswald could not have fired the shots in the time available to him,\r\nthat he was not a good enough marksman to have scored the hits with the\r\nrifle, that there were other people in the lunchroom of the Depository\r\nBuilding when he was confronted by Patrolman M. L. Baker, and that\r\nthere are no eyewitnesses who could identify Oswald as having been in\r\nthe window. Each of these speculations is dealt with below in the light\r\nof the testimony and evidence considered by the Commission.\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald could not have known the motorcade route before\r\nhe arrived at work on November 22.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The motorcade route was published in both Dallas\r\npapers on November 19 and was therefore available at least 72 hours\r\nbefore Oswald reported for work on November 22.[A12-16]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The route as shown in the newspaper took the motorcade\r\nthrough the Triple Underpass via Main Street, a block away from the\r\nDepository. Therefore, Oswald could not have known that the motorcade\r\nwould pass directly by the Texas School Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The motorcade route as published showed the\r\nmotorcade turning right off Main Street onto Houston for one block\r\nand then left on Elm to the access road to the Stemmons Freeway. This\r\nroute was clearly indicated in published descriptions and maps of the\r\nmotorcade route. There was no mention of continuing on Main Street\r\nthrough the Triple Underpass.[A12-17]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The motorcade route was changed on November 22 after\r\nthe map had been printed. The motorcade was shifted from Main Street\r\nover to Elm Street to bring it by the Texas School Book Depository\r\nBuilding.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The motorcade route was decided upon on November\r\n18 and published in the Dallas newspapers on November 19. It was not\r\nchanged in any way thereafter. The route called for the motorcade to\r\nturn off Main Street at Houston, go up to Elm, and then turn left on\r\nElm Street.[A12-18]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The normal and logical route would have been straight\r\ndown Main Street through the Triple Underpass to the Stemmons Freeway.\r\nIt is possible to drive from Main onto the access road to the Stemmons\r\nFreeway from a point beyond the underpass.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The normal, direct, and only permissible route\r\nto the Stemmons Freeway from Main Street is via Houston and Elm\r\nStreets. Any attempt to turn onto the access road to the Stemmons\r\nFreeway from Main Street beyond the Triple Underpass would have been\r\nextremely difficult because of a concrete strip dividing Elm and Main\r\nStreets. Such an attempt would have required making an S-turn beyond\r\nthe strip at a very tight angle, thereby slowing the Presidential car\r\nalmost to a stop.[A12-19]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald may well have carried curtain rods to work on\r\nNovember 22 in the brown paper package he was observed to bring into\r\nthe building because he lived in a room where he needed them.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--According to Oswald’s landlady at 1026 North\r\nBeckley Avenue, Mrs. A. C. Johnson, the room had venetian blinds,\r\ncurtain rods, and curtains while Oswald was living there. The curtain\r\nrods in the Paine garage that belonged to Mrs. Paine were still there\r\nafter Oswald went to work on November 22. Mrs. Paine and Marina Oswald\r\ntestified that Oswald had not spoken to them about curtain rods. After\r\nthe assassination the empty package was found near the window from\r\nwhich the shots were fired, but no curtain rods were found.[A12-20]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald spent the morning of November 22 in the company\r\nof other workers in the building and remained with them until they went\r\ndownstairs to watch the President go by, no later probably than 12:15.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Oswald did not spend the morning in the company\r\nof other workers in the building, and before the assassination he was\r\nlast seen in the building on the sixth floor at about 11:55 a.m. by\r\nCharles Givens, another employee.[A12-21]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--It is probable that the chicken lunch, remains of which\r\nwere found on the sixth floor, was eaten by an accomplice of Oswald who\r\nhad hidden on the sixth floor overnight.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The chicken lunch had been eaten shortly after\r\nnoon on November 22 by Bonnie Ray Williams, an employee of the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository, who after eating his lunch went to the fifth\r\nfloor where he was when the shots were fired. Oswald did not eat the\r\nchicken lunch, nor did he drink from the soft drink bottle found near\r\nthe chicken lunch.[A12-22]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Laboratory tests showed remains of the chicken lunch\r\nfound on the sixth floor were 2 days old.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The chicken lunch remains had been left there\r\nshortly after noon on November 22 by Bonnie Ray Williams.[A12-23]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--An amateur 8-millimeter photograph taken at 12:20 p.m.,\r\n10 minutes before the assassination of President Kennedy, showed two\r\nsilhouettes at the sixth-floor window of the Depository.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--A film taken by an amateur photographer,\r\nRobert J. E. Hughes, just before the assassination, shows a shadow\r\nin the southeast corner window of the sixth floor. This has been\r\ndetermined after examination by the FBI and the U.S. Navy Photographic\r\nInterpretation Center to be the shadow from the cartons near the\r\nwindow.[A12-24]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--A picture published widely in newspapers and magazines\r\nafter the assassination showed Lee Harvey Oswald standing on the front\r\nsteps of the Texas School Book Depository Building shortly before the\r\nPresident’s motorcade passed by.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The man on the front steps of the building,\r\nthought or alleged by some to be Lee Harvey Oswald, is actually Billy\r\nLovelady, an employee of the Texas School Book Depository, who somewhat\r\nresembles Oswald. Lovelady has identified himself in the picture, and\r\nother employees of the Depository standing with him, as shown in the\r\npicture, have verified that he was the man in the picture and that\r\nOswald was not there.[A12-25]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The post office box in Dallas to which Oswald had the\r\nrifle mailed was kept under both his name and that of A. Hidell.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--It is not known whether Oswald’s application\r\nlisted the name A. Hidell as one entitled to receive mail at the box.\r\nIn accordance with U.S. Post Office regulations, the portion of the\r\napplication listing the names of persons other than the applicant\r\nentitled to receive mail was discarded after the box was closed on May\r\n14, 1963. During the summer of 1963, Oswald rented a post office box\r\nin New Orleans, listing the name “Hidell” in addition to his own name\r\nand that of his wife. Hidell was a favorite alias used by Oswald on a\r\nnumber of occasions. Diligent search has failed to reveal any person in\r\nDallas or New Orleans by that name. It was merely a creation for his\r\nown purposes.[A12-26]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The President’s car was going at a speed estimated at\r\nfrom 12 to 20 miles per hour, thus presenting a target comparable to\r\nthe most difficult that a soldier would encounter under battlefield\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--During the period between the time that the\r\nfirst and second shots struck the President, the Presidential car was\r\ntraveling at an average speed of approximately 11.2 miles per hour.\r\nExpert witnesses testified that the target is regarded as a favorable\r\none because the car was going away from the marksman in a straight\r\nline.[A12-27]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald could not have fired three shots from the\r\nMannlicher-Carcano rifle in 5½ seconds.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--According to expert witnesses, exacting tests\r\nconducted for the Commission demonstrated that it was possible to fire\r\nthree shots from the rifle within 5½ seconds. It should be noted that\r\nthe first loaded shell was already in the chamber ready for firing;\r\nOswald had only to pull the trigger to fire the first shot and to\r\nwork the bolt twice in order to fire the second and third shots. They\r\ntestified that if the second shot missed, Oswald had between 4.8 and\r\n5.6 seconds to fire the three shots. If either the first or third\r\nshot missed, Oswald had in excess of 7 seconds to fire the three\r\nshots.[A12-28]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald did not have the marksmanship ability\r\ndemonstrated by the rifleman who fired the shots.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Oswald qualified as a sharpshooter and a\r\nmarksman with the M-1 rifle in the Marine Corps. Marina Oswald\r\ntestified that in New Orleans her husband practiced operating the bolt\r\nof the rifle. Moreover, experts stated that the scope was a substantial\r\naid for rapid, accurate firing. The Commission concluded that Oswald\r\nhad the capability with a rifle to commit assassination.[A12-29]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The name of the rifle used in the assassination\r\nappeared on the rifle. Therefore, the searchers who found the rifle on\r\nthe sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository should have been\r\nable to identify it correctly by name.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--An examination of the rifle does not reveal any\r\nmanufacturer’s name. An inscription on the rifle shows that it was made\r\nin Italy. The rifle was identified by Captain Fritz and Lieutenant Day,\r\nwho were the first to actually handle it.[A12-30]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The rifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School\r\nBook Depository was identified as a 7.65 Mauser by the man who found\r\nit, Deputy Constable Seymour Weitzman.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Weitzman, the original source of the speculation\r\nthat the rifle was a Mauser, and Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boone found the\r\nweapon. Weitzman did not handle the rifle and did not examine it at\r\nclose range. He had little more than a glimpse of it and thought it\r\nwas a Mauser, a German bolt-type rifle similar in appearance to the\r\nMannlicher-Carcano. Police laboratory technicians subsequently arrived\r\nand correctly identified the weapon as a 6.5 Italian rifle.[A12-31]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--There is evidence that a second rifle was discovered on\r\nthe roof of the Texas School Book Depository or on the overpass.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--No second rifle was found in either of these\r\nplaces or in any other place. The shots that struck President Kennedy\r\nand Governor Connally came from the rifle found on the sixth floor of\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository.[A12-32]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--It is possible that there was a second\r\nMannlicher-Carcano rifle involved in the assassination. The Irving\r\nSports Shop mounted a scope on a rifle 3 weeks before the assassination.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Dial D. Ryder, an employee of the Irving Sports\r\nShop, has stated that he found on his workbench on November 23 an\r\nundated work tag with the name “Oswald” on it, indicating that sometime\r\nduring the first 2 weeks of November three holes had been bored in a\r\nrifle and a telescopic sight mounted on it and bore-sighted. However,\r\nRyder and his employer, Charles W. Greener, had no recollection of\r\nOswald, of his Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, of the transaction allegedly\r\nrepresented by the repair tag, or of any person for whom such a repair\r\nwas supposedly made. The rifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository had two holes in it bored for the installation\r\nof a scope prior to shipment to Oswald in March 1963. The Commission\r\nconcluded that it is doubtful whether the tag produced by Ryder was\r\nauthentic. All of the evidence developed proves that Oswald owned only\r\nthe one rifle--the Mannlicher-Carcano--and that he did not bring it or\r\na second rifle to the Irving Sports Shop.[A12-33]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Ammunition for the rifle found on the sixth floor of\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository had not been manufactured since the\r\nend of World War II. The ammunition used by Oswald must, therefore,\r\nhave been at least 20 years old, making it extremely unreliable.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The ammunition used in the rifle was American\r\nammunition recently made by the Western Cartridge Co., which\r\nmanufactures such ammunition currently. In tests with the same kind of\r\nammunition, experts fired Oswald’s Mannlicher-Carcano rifle more than\r\n100 times without any misfires.[A12-34]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The assertion that Oswald’s palmprint appeared on the\r\nrifle is false. The FBI told newsmen in an off-the-record briefing\r\nsession that there was no palmprint on the rifle.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The FBI confirmed that the palmprint lifted\r\nby the Dallas police from the rifle found on the sixth floor of the\r\nTexas School Book Depository Building was Oswald’s palmprint. The\r\nFBI informed the Commission that no FBI agent made statements of any\r\ntype to the press concerning the existence or nonexistence of this\r\nprint.[A12-35]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--If Oswald had been gloveless, he would have left\r\nfingerprints on the rifle because he would not have had time to wipe\r\nthe prints off the rifle after he had fired it.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--An FBI fingerprint expert testified that the\r\npoor quality of the metal and wooden parts would cause them to absorb\r\nmoisture from the skin, thereby making a clear print unlikely. There\r\nis no evidence that Oswald wore gloves or that he wiped prints off the\r\nrifle. Latent fingerprints were found on the rifle but they were too\r\nincomplete to be identified.[A12-36]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Gordon Shanklin, the special agent in charge of the\r\nDallas office of the FBI, stated that the paraffin test of Oswald’s\r\nface and hands was positive and proved that he had fired a rifle.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The paraffin tests were conducted by members\r\nof the Dallas Police Department and the technical examinations by\r\nmembers of the Dallas City-County Criminal Investigation Laboratory.\r\nThe FBI has notified the Commission that neither Shanklin nor any other\r\nrepresentative of the FBI ever made such a statement. The Commission\r\nhas found no evidence that Special Agent Shanklin ever made this\r\nstatement publicly.[A12-37]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Marina Oswald stated that she did not know that her\r\nhusband owned a rifle nor did she know that he owned a pistol.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--There is no evidence that Marina Oswald ever\r\ntold this to any authorities. On the afternoon of November 22, she\r\ntold the police that her husband owned a rifle and that he kept it\r\nin the garage of the Paine house in Irving. Later, at Dallas police\r\nheadquarters, she said that she could not identify as her husband’s the\r\nrifle shown her by policemen. When Marina Oswald appeared before the\r\nCommission she was shown the Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5 rifle found on the\r\nsixth floor of the Depository and identified it as the “fateful rifle\r\nof Lee Oswald.”[A12-38]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The picture of Oswald taken by his wife in March or\r\nApril 1963 and showing him with a rifle and a pistol was “doctored”\r\nwhen it appeared in magazines and newspapers in February 1964. The\r\nrifle held by Oswald in these pictures is not the same rifle that was\r\nfound on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Life magazine, Newsweek, and the New York Times\r\nnotified the Commission that they had retouched this picture. In doing\r\nso, they inadvertently altered details of the configuration of the\r\nrifle. The original prints of this picture have been examined by the\r\nCommission and by photographic experts who have identified the rifle as\r\na Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5, the same kind as the one found on the sixth\r\nfloor of the Texas School Book Depository. FBI experts testified that\r\nthe picture was taken with Oswald’s camera.[A12-39]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The rifle picture of Oswald was a composite one with\r\nOswald’s face pasted on somebody else’s body.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Marina Oswald has testified that she took this\r\npicture with a camera owned by her husband and subsequently identified\r\nas Oswald’s Imperial Reflex camera. She identified the man in the\r\npicture as her husband. Experts also state the picture was not a\r\ncomposite.[A12-40]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--After firing the shots, Oswald could not have disposed\r\nof the rifle and descended the stairs to the lunchroom in time to get a\r\ndrink from a soft drink machine and be there when Patrolman Baker came\r\nin.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--A series of time tests made by investigators\r\nand by Roy S. Truly and Patrolman M. L. Baker at the request of the\r\nCommission, show that it was possible for Oswald to have placed the\r\nrifle behind a box and descended to the lunchroom on the second floor\r\nbefore Patrolman Baker and Truly got up there. Oswald did not have a\r\nsoft drink bottle in his hand at the time he was confronted by Baker\r\nand he was not standing by the soft drink machine. He was just entering\r\nthe lunchroom; Baker caught a glimpse of him through the glass panel in\r\nthe door leading to the lunchroom vestibule.[A12-41]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--There were other people present in the lunchroom at the\r\ntime that Baker and Truly saw Oswald there.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Baker and Truly have both stated that there\r\nwas no one in the lunchroom other than Oswald at the time that they\r\nentered. No other witness to this incident has been found.[A12-42]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Police were sealing off all exits from the building by\r\nthe time Oswald got to the second floor.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Police may have begun to take up positions\r\nat the exits to the building as early as 12:33, but it is unlikely\r\nthat they had blocked them off completely until 12:37 p.m. at the\r\nearliest. Oswald was seen in an office, walking toward an exit leading\r\nto the front stairway, at about 12:33 p.m. Oswald probably had at\r\nleast 7 minutes in which to get out of the building without being\r\nstopped.[A12-43]\r\n\r\n\r\nOSWALD’S MOVEMENTS BETWEEN 12:33 AND 1:15 P.M.\r\n\r\nOne of the major theses urged in support of the theory that Oswald did\r\nnot murder Patrolman Tippit was that his known movements after he left\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository would not have permitted him to have\r\narrived at 10th Street and Patton Avenue in time to encounter Tippit by\r\n1:16 p.m. Careful reenactments by investigative agencies and by members\r\nof the Commission staff of Oswald’s movements from the time he left\r\nthe Texas School Book Depository until he encountered Tippit verified\r\nthat Oswald could reach his roominghouse at 1026 North Beckley Avenue\r\nat approximately 1 p.m. or earlier. The housekeeper at the roominghouse\r\ntestified that Oswald spent only a few minutes at the house, leaving\r\nas hurriedly as he had arrived. During police interrogation after his\r\narrest, Oswald admitted to riding both bus and taxi in returning to his\r\nroominghouse after the assassination of the President. From 1026 North\r\nBeckley Avenue, Oswald could easily have walked the nine tenths of a\r\nmile to 10th Street and Patton Avenue where he encountered Tippit.\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--A detailed and remarkably clear description of Oswald\r\nwas sent over the police radio in Dallas at 12:36 p.m., November 22,\r\n1963.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The radio logs of the Dallas Police Department\r\nand the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office show that no description of a\r\nsuspect in the assassination of the President was broadcast before\r\n12:45 p.m. on that day. No reference to Oswald by name was broadcast\r\nbefore he was arrested. The description of the suspect that was\r\nbroadcast was similar to that of Oswald, but it lacked some important\r\nspecific details such as color of hair and eyes. The information for\r\nthe initial broadcasts most probably came from Howard Brennan, who saw\r\nOswald in the window when he was firing the rifle.[A12-44]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald did not have time for all of the movements\r\nimputed to him between his departure from the Texas School Book\r\nDepository and his encounter with Tippit.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Time tests of all of Oswald’s movements\r\nestablish that these movements could have been accomplished in the time\r\navailable to him.[A12-45]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald was stopped by police as he left the building\r\nand was permitted to pass after he told them he worked in the building.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The Commission has found no witness who\r\nsaw Oswald leave the building. This speculation is probably a\r\nmisinterpretation of the fact that he was stopped in the lunchroom\r\nby Patrolman Baker before he left the building and was allowed to\r\nproceed after Truly, the Depository superintendent, identified him as\r\nan employee there. Police did not seal off the building until at least\r\nseveral minutes after Oswald could have left.[A12-46]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The log of the cabdriver who took Oswald to North\r\nBeckley Avenue, William W. Whaley, shows that Oswald entered his cab at\r\n12:30 p.m. Since this occurred at some distance from the point of the\r\nPresident’s assassination, Oswald could not have shot the President.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Whaley’s log does show 12:30 p.m., but he has\r\ntestified that he was not accurate in logging the time that passengers\r\nentered his cab, that he usually logged them at 15-minute intervals,\r\nand that it was undoubtedly some time later than 12:30 when Oswald\r\nentered his cab. Sometimes he did not make entries in his logbook until\r\nthree or four trips later. The bus transfer in Oswald’s possession\r\nwas issued after 12:36 p.m. The Commission has determined that Oswald\r\nprobably entered Whaley’s cab at about 12:47 or 12:48 p.m.[A12-47]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The distance from the Greyhound terminal in Dallas,\r\nwhere Oswald entered the cab, to North Beckley Avenue, where he\r\nprobably left the cab, is something over 3 miles--normally a 10-minute\r\ncab drive. Given the traffic jam that existed at the time, it is\r\ndoubtful that Whaley could have made the trip in less than 15 minutes.\r\nOne estimate has placed the time at 24 minutes from the Greyhound\r\nterminal to Oswald’s roominghouse.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The distance from the Greyhound bus terminal\r\nat Jackson and Lamar Streets to the 500 block of North Beckley is 2.5\r\nmiles. Oswald actually got out in the 700 block of North Beckley. The\r\ndistance was, therefore, less than 2.5 miles. Whaley has testified to\r\nthe Commission that the trip took 6 minutes. Test runs made by members\r\nof the Commission staff under traffic conditions somewhat similar to\r\nthose that existed on November 22, took approximately 5 minutes and\r\n30 seconds. To walk from Beckley and Neely, which is the 700 block of\r\nBeckley, where Oswald probably left the cab, to 1026 North Beckley,\r\ntook Commission staff members 5 minutes and 45 seconds.[A12-48]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald was on his way to Jack Ruby’s apartment when he\r\nwas stopped by Patrolman Tippit.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--There is no evidence that Oswald and Ruby knew\r\neach other or had any relationship through a third party or parties.\r\nThere is no evidence that Oswald knew where Ruby lived. Accordingly,\r\nthere is neither evidence nor reason to believe that Oswald was on his\r\nway to Ruby’s apartment when he was stopped by Tippit.[A12-49]\r\n\r\n\r\nMURDER OF TIPPIT\r\n\r\nSpeculations on the murder of Tippit centered about assertions that he\r\nwas elsewhere than he was supposed to be when he was shot, that he knew\r\nthe man who shot him, and that the description of the murderer given by\r\none of the eyewitnesses did not fit Oswald’s description.\r\n\r\nThe Commission found that Tippit was unquestionably patrolling in an\r\narea to which he had been directed by police headquarters. There was\r\nno evidence to support the speculation that Tippit and Oswald knew\r\neach other or had ever seen each other before. The description of the\r\nmurderer imputed to one of the witnesses was denied by her and had no\r\nsupport from any other eyewitness.\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Tippit was driving alone in his police car even though\r\nstanding orders for police in Dallas were that radio cars of the type\r\nTippit was driving must have two policemen in them.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Dallas police officials stated that department\r\npolicy required about 80 percent of the patrolmen on the day shift, 7\r\na.m. to 3 p.m., to work alone. Tippit was one of the patrolmen assigned\r\nto work alone that day.[A12-50]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Tippit was violating an order he had received the day\r\nbefore not to leave the sector to which he had been assigned. This\r\nsector was supposed to be in downtown Dallas at the time he stopped\r\nOswald.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--A review of Tippit’s file in the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment and the department’s radio log revealed that following the\r\nshooting of the President, Tippit was directed to move into and remain\r\nin the central Oak Cliff area available for any emergency.[A12-51]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The police had been withdrawn from the area in which\r\nTippit found Oswald.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Other police cars were operating in the Oak\r\nCliff area at the same time as Tippit. They participated in the\r\nsubsequent search for and apprehension of Tippit’s slayer.[A12-52]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Tippit violated a procedure governing radio cars when\r\nhe failed to notify headquarters that he was stopping to question a\r\nsuspect.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The Dallas Police Department had no requirement\r\nor regulation for police officers to notify headquarters when stopping\r\nto question a suspect. Therefore, Tippit did not violate any police\r\nradio procedure in failing to notify the radio dispatcher that he was\r\nstopping Oswald.[A12-53]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Tippit could not have recognized Oswald from the\r\ndescription sent out over the police radio.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--There is no certain way of knowing whether\r\nTippit recognized Oswald from the description put out by the police\r\nradio. The Dallas Police Department radio log shows that the police\r\nradio dispatcher at 1:29 p.m. noted a similarity between the broadcast\r\ndescriptions of the President’s assassin and Tippit’s slayer. It is\r\nconceivable, even probable, that Tippit stopped Oswald because of the\r\ndescription broadcast by the police radio.[A12-54]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Tippit and his killer knew each other.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Investigation has revealed no evidence that\r\nOswald and Tippit were acquainted, had ever seen each other, or had any\r\nmutual acquaintances. Witnesses to the shooting observed no signs of\r\nrecognition between the two men.[A12-55]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Mrs. Helen Markham, a witness to the slaying of Tippit,\r\nput the time at just after 1:06 p.m. This would have made it impossible\r\nfor Oswald to have committed the killing since he would not have had\r\ntime to arrive at the shooting scene by that time.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The shooting of Tippit has been established\r\nat approximately 1:15 or 1:16 p.m. on the basis of a call to police\r\nheadquarters on Tippit’s car radio by another witness to the\r\nassassination, Domingo Benavides. In her various statements and in\r\nher testimony, Mrs. Markham was uncertain and inconsistent in her\r\nrecollection of the exact time of the slaying.[A12-56]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Mrs. Helen Markham is the only witness to the killing\r\nof Tippit.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Other witnesses to the killing of Tippit\r\ninclude Domingo Benavides, who used Tippit’s car radio to notify the\r\npolice dispatcher of the killing at 1:16 p.m., and William Scoggins,\r\na cabdriver parked at the corner of 10th Street and Patton Avenue.\r\nBarbara Jeanette Davis and Virginia Davis saw a man with a pistol in\r\nhis hand walk across their lawn immediately after they heard the sound\r\nof the shots that killed Tippit. The man emptied the shells from his\r\npistol and turned the corner from 10th Street onto Patton Avenue.\r\nAll of these witnesses, except Benavides, subsequently picked Oswald\r\nout of a lineup as the slayer. Benavides did not feel that he could\r\nmake a positive identification and never attended a lineup for the\r\npurpose.[A12-57]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Mrs. Markham said that the man she saw shooting Tippit\r\nwas about 30, short, with bushy hair, and wearing a white coat. Since\r\nOswald does not fit this description he could not be the killer.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--In evaluating Helen Markham’s testimony the\r\nCommission is aware of allegations that she described the killer of\r\nPatrolman Tippit as short, stocky, and with bushy hair, which would\r\nnot be a correct description of Oswald. It has also been alleged that\r\nMrs. Markham identified Oswald in the lineup because of his clothing\r\nrather than his appearance. When Oswald appeared in the lineup at which\r\nMrs. Markham was present, he was not wearing the jacket which he wore\r\nat the time of the shooting, and Mrs. Markham has testified that her\r\nidentification was based “mostly from his face.”[A12-58] Moreover,\r\nMrs. Markham has denied that she ever described the man who killed\r\nTippit as short, stocky, and with bushy hair. The Commission reviewed\r\nthe transcript of a telephone conversation in which Mrs. Markham was\r\nalleged to have made such a description. In the transcription Mrs.\r\nMarkham reaffirmed her positive identification of Oswald and denied\r\nhaving described the killer as short, stocky, and bushy haired.[A12-59]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Another witness to the slaying of Patrolman Tippit, an\r\nunidentified woman, was interviewed by the FBI but was never called\r\nas a witness by the President’s Commission on the Assassination of\r\nPresident Kennedy. This witness is alleged to have stated that she saw\r\ntwo men involved in the shooting and that they ran off in opposite\r\ndirections afterward.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The only woman among the witnesses to the\r\nslaying of Tippit known to the Commission is Helen Markham. The FBI\r\nnever interviewed any other woman who claimed to have seen the shooting\r\nand never received any information concerning the existence of such a\r\nwitness. Two women, Barbara Jeanette Davis and Virginia Davis, saw the\r\nkiller immediately after the shooting as he crossed the lawn at the\r\ncorner of Patton Avenue and 10th Street, but they did not witness the\r\nshooting itself. They were both interviewed by the FBI and appeared\r\nbefore the Commission. The Commission has no evidence that there was\r\nany witness to the slaying other than those identified in chapter\r\nIV.[A12-60]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--No witness saw Oswald between the time he was supposed\r\nto have reloaded his gun near the scene of the slaying and his\r\nappearance at the shoestore on Jefferson Boulevard.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Six witnesses identified Oswald as the man they\r\nsaw in flight after the murder of Tippit. The killer was seen, gun in\r\nhand, by Ted Callaway and Sam Guinyard in the block of Patton Avenue\r\nbetween 10th Street and Jefferson Boulevard after the shooting of\r\nTippit. They saw him run to Jefferson and turn right. On the evening\r\nof November 22, Callaway and Guinyard picked Oswald out of a police\r\nlineup as the man they saw with the gun. Two other men, Warren Reynolds\r\nand Pat Patterson, saw a man with a pistol in his hand running south\r\non Patton Avenue. They followed him for a block on Jefferson Boulevard\r\nand then lost sight of him. Both men subsequently identified pictures\r\nof Oswald as the man they saw with the gun. Harold Russell also saw a\r\nman with a gun running south on Patton Avenue and later identified him\r\nfrom pictures as Oswald. Mrs. Mary Brock saw a man she later identified\r\nas Oswald walk at a fast pace into the parking lot behind the service\r\nstation at the corner of Jefferson and Crawford, where Oswald’s jacket\r\nwas found shortly after.[A12-61]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--When Oswald left his roominghouse at about 1 p.m. on\r\nNovember 22 he had on a zipper-type tan plaid jacket.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The jacket that Oswald was wearing at the time\r\nof the slaying of Tippit was a light-gray jacket. According to Marina\r\nOswald, her husband owned only two jackets--one blue and the other\r\nlight gray. The housekeeper at 1026 North Beckley Avenue, Mrs. Earlene\r\nRoberts, was not certain about the color of the jacket that Oswald was\r\nwearing when he left the house.[A12-62]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald wore an olive-brown plain jacket which is\r\nvisible in all the pictures of him after his arrest.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--At the time of his arrest, Oswald was not\r\nwearing a jacket. The jacket that was subsequently recovered in a\r\nparking lot and identified as Oswald’s was a light-gray one. There are\r\nno witnesses who have stated that Oswald was wearing an olive-brown\r\njacket immediately before or after his arrest. The Commission has seen\r\nno pictures of Oswald taken subsequent to his arrest that show him in\r\nsuch a jacket. Pictures taken shortly after his arrest show him in the\r\nshirt that Mrs. Bledsoe described him as wearing when she saw him on\r\nthe bus at approximately 1:40 p.m.[A12-63]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald’s landlady, Mrs. A. C. Johnson, said that Oswald\r\nnever had a gun in the room.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--In her testimony before the Commission, Mrs.\r\nJohnson said that he “never brought that rifle in my house. * * *\r\nHe could have had this pistol, I don’t know, because they found the\r\nscabbard.”[A12-64] As shown in chapter IV, Oswald kept his rifle in the\r\nPaine garage in Irving while he was living in Dallas during October and\r\nNovember. The pistol was small and easily concealed.[A12-65]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--There was absolutely no place to hide a gun in Oswald’s\r\nroom at 1026 North Beckley Avenue.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--In the search of Oswald’s room after his\r\napprehension police found a pistol holster. Oswald’s landlady, Mrs.\r\nA. C. Johnson, stated that she had not seen the holster before. There\r\nis no reason to believe that Oswald could not have had both a pistol\r\nand the holster hidden in the room. Oswald’s pistol was a small one\r\nwith the barrel cut down to 2¼ inches. It could have been concealed in\r\na pocket of his clothes.[A12-66]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald did not pick up the revolver from his room at 1\r\np.m.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--There is reason to believe that Oswald did pick\r\nup the revolver from his room, probably concealing it beneath his\r\njacket. This likelihood is reinforced by the finding of the pistol\r\nholster in the room after the assassination, since this indicates that\r\nOswald did not store the pistol at the home of Mrs. Paine where he\r\nspent the night before the assassination.[A12-67]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--No one saw Oswald enter the Texas Theatre.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--A nearby shoe store manager, Johnny C. Brewer,\r\nand the theatre cashier, Julia Postal, saw Oswald enter the lobby of\r\nthe theatre from where he went on into the theatre proper.[A12-68]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Not a single one of the people in the Texas Theatre at\r\nthe time of Oswald’s arrest has come forward or been brought forward to\r\ngive an eyewitness account of the arrest.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Johnny C. Brewer, the shoe store manager, and\r\ntwo patrons of the theatre--John Gibson and George Jefferson Applin,\r\nJr.--were present in the theatre and testified before the Commission on\r\nthe circumstances of Oswald’s arrest at the Texas Theatre. Only 6 or 7\r\npeople were seated on the main floor of the theatre.[A12-69]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--There is no independent witness aside from the police\r\nwho testified that Oswald was carrying a gun when arrested by the\r\npolice.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Johnny Brewer testified before the Commission\r\nthat he saw Oswald pull a gun and that he saw it taken away from him by\r\na policeman.[A12-70]\r\n\r\n\r\nOSWALD AFTER HIS ARREST\r\n\r\nThe Commission found that assertions that the Dallas police treated\r\nOswald brutally and denied him his constitutional rights to legal\r\ncounsel had no foundation in fact. Insinuations that Dallas police\r\nofficials and District Attorney Henry M. Wade fabricated or altered\r\nevidence to establish the guilt of Oswald were baseless. It is true\r\nthat police officials and the district attorney made errors in giving\r\nevidential information to the press, but these were clearly the result\r\nof misapprehensions or ignorance rather than intent, and at the worst\r\nrepresent bad judgment. At least one imputed fabrication of fact,\r\nfurther embellished by repetition, never really occurred. Sinister\r\nconnotations were evoked by the attribution to the district attorney\r\nof the statement that a taxicab driver named Darryl Click drove Oswald\r\nfrom downtown Dallas to the area of his roominghouse in Oak Cliff. It\r\nhas been correctly ascertained that no such taxicab driver existed in\r\nDallas. On the other hand, the district attorney, who was quoted in a\r\nnewspaper transcript as making the statement, never made the statement\r\nnor did any one else. Audio tapes of the district attorney’s press\r\nconference make clear that the person who transcribed the conference\r\nrendered a reference to the “Oak Cliff” area of Dallas as a person,\r\n“Darryl Click”. This error in transcription is the sole source for the\r\nexistence of a “Darryl Click” as a taxicab driver.\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald was the victim of police brutality.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Oswald resisted arrest in the Texas Theatre and\r\ndrew a gun. He received a slight cut over his right eye and a bruise\r\nunder his left eye in the course of his struggles. During the time he\r\nwas in police custody, he was neither ill-treated nor abused.[A12-71]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald was never formally charged with the\r\nassassination of the President; he was charged only with the shooting\r\nof Patrolman J. D. Tippit.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Oswald was arraigned for the murder of President\r\nKennedy before Justice of the Peace David Johnston on the fourth\r\nfloor of the Police Department building at 1:35 a.m., November 23.\r\nPreviously, he had been arraigned before Johnston for the murder of\r\nTippit at 7:10 p.m., November 22.[A12-72]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The police questioned Oswald extensively about the\r\nTippit murder on the first day of his detention. They did not question\r\nhim about the assassination of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Dallas police officials stated that they\r\nquestioned Oswald repeatedly on November 22 about the assassination\r\nof President Kennedy and his relationship to it. At the first\r\ninterrogation, Captain Fritz asked Oswald to account for himself at the\r\ntime the President was shot. FBI agents who were present also stated\r\nthat he was questioned about the assassination of the President.[A12-73]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald’s attempts to get legal counsel were\r\ndeliberately thwarted by the police and he was cut off from outside\r\ncalls that would have permitted him to obtain a lawyer.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--On November 23, Oswald was visited by the\r\npresident of the Dallas Bar Association, H. Louis Nichols, who offered\r\nhim help in getting a lawyer; Oswald refused the offer. Oswald was told\r\nby the police that he could use the telephone when he wished, and he\r\ndid make telephone calls. He attempted to call attorney John Abt in New\r\nYork but was unsuccessful in reaching him. Mrs. Paine testified that\r\nat Oswald’s request she tried without success to reach Abt. Oswald was\r\nalso visited by his wife, mother, and brother, to any of whom he could\r\nhave turned for help in getting counsel.[A12-74]\r\n\r\n\r\nOSWALD IN THE SOVIET UNION\r\n\r\nOswald’s residence in the Soviet Union for more than 2½ years aroused\r\nspeculation after his arrest that he was an agent of the Soviet Union\r\nor in some way affiliated with it. This speculation was supported by\r\nassertions that he had received exceptionally favored treatment from\r\nthe Soviet Government in securing permission to enter and leave the\r\ncountry, especially the latter, because his Russian wife and child were\r\npermitted to leave with him. The careful analysis of these speculations\r\nin chapter VI of this report led to the Commission’s conclusion that\r\nthere is no credible evidence that Oswald was an agent of the Soviet\r\nGovernment and that he did not receive unusually favorable treatment\r\nin entering or leaving the Soviet Union or in returning to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--A young private in the Marine Corps in the 1950’s could\r\nnot study Marxism, learn Russian, and read Soviet newspapers without\r\nany adverse repercussions in his unit.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Although Oswald’s interest in the Soviet\r\nUnion was well known, his interest in Marxism was apparently known\r\nto only a few of his fellow marines. While stationed in California,\r\nhe studied Russian. In February 1959, while still in the Marines,\r\nhe took an official test on his proficiency in Russian and was\r\nrated “Poor.” In California at about this time he probably read a\r\nRussian-language newspaper. The reactions of his fellow Marines who\r\nwere aware of his interests in Marxism and the Soviet Union were\r\napparently not antagonistic and did not deter him from pursuing these\r\ninterests.[A12-75]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald learned Russian during his service in the\r\nMarines as part of his military training.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Oswald never received any training from the\r\nMarine Corps in the Russian language. His studies of Russian were\r\nentirely on his own time and at his own initiative.[A12-76]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald could not have saved $1,600 from his Marine pay\r\nfor his trip to Russia in 1959.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--In November 1959, Oswald told an American\r\nreporter in Moscow, Aline Mosby, that he had saved $1,500 (not $1,600)\r\nwhile in the Marines. It is entirely consistent with Oswald’s known\r\nfrugality that he could have saved the money from the $3,452.20 in\r\npay he received while he was in the Marines. Moreover, despite his\r\nstatement to Aline Mosby, he may not actually have saved $1,500, for\r\nit was possible for him to have made the trip to Russia in 1959 for\r\nconsiderably less than that amount.[A12-77]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--It is probable that Oswald had prior contacts with\r\nSoviet agents before he entered Russia in 1959 because his application\r\nfor a visa was processed and approved immediately on receipt.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--There is no evidence that Oswald was in touch\r\nwith Soviet agents before his visit to Russia. The time that it took\r\nfor him to receive his visa in Helsinki for entrance to the Soviet\r\nUnion was shorter than the average but not beyond the normal range for\r\nthe granting of such visas. Had Oswald been recruited as a Russian\r\nagent while he was still in the Marines, it is most improbable that he\r\nwould have been encouraged to defect. He would have been of greater\r\nvalue to Russian intelligence as a Marine radar operator than as a\r\ndefector.[A12-78]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Soviet suspicion of Oswald is indicated by the fact\r\nthat he was sent off to work in a radio plant in Minsk as an unskilled\r\nhand at the lowest rate of pay although he qualified as a trained radar\r\nand electronics technician.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The Soviet Government probably was suspicious\r\nof Oswald, as it would be of any American who appeared in Moscow and\r\nsaid he wanted to live in the Soviet Union. Under the circumstances it\r\nis to be expected that he would be placed in a position that would not\r\ninvolve national security. Moreover, Oswald had been a radar operator,\r\nnot a technician, in the Marines. His total income in Russia was higher\r\nthan normal because his pay was supplemented for about a year by\r\npayments from the Soviet “Red Cross,” an official agency of the Soviet\r\nGovernment. Oswald believed that these payments really came from the\r\nMVD. It is a policy of the Soviet Government to subsidize defectors\r\nfrom Western nations who settle in the Soviet Union, in order that\r\ntheir standard of living may not be too much lower than their previous\r\nstandard in their own country. [A12-79]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald was trained by the Russians in a special school\r\nfor assassins at Minsk.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Commission investigations revealed no evidence\r\nto support this claim or the existence of such a school in Minsk during\r\nthe time Oswald was there. Oswald belonged to a hunting club near\r\nMinsk, but there is no evidence that this was other than an ordinary\r\nhunting club.[A12-80]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Marina Oswald’s father was an important part of the\r\nSoviet intelligence apparatus.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Marina Oswald’s father died while she was still\r\nan infant. This reference is presumably to her uncle, Ilya Prusakov,\r\nwho was an executive in the lumber industry, which position carried\r\nwith it the rank of lieutenant colonel or colonel in the Ministry of\r\nInternal Affairs (MVD). Since 1953 the MVD has not been concerned with\r\ninternal security or other police functions.[A12-81]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--It was most exceptional that Oswald was able to bring\r\nhis wife and child out of the Soviet Union with him.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--There is no reason to believe that the Oswalds\r\nreceived unusually favorable treatment in being permitted or assisted\r\nto leave the Soviet Union together. Other American citizens have\r\nbrought their Russian wives out of the Soviet Union, both before and\r\nafter Oswald.[A12-82]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald never would have been permitted to return to the\r\nUnited States if Soviet intelligence had not planned to use him in some\r\nway against the United States.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--There is no evidence that Oswald had any working\r\nrelationship with the Soviet Government or Soviet intelligence. The\r\nRussians have permitted other American defectors to return to the\r\nUnited States.[A12-83]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Since the exit visa for Marina Oswald was granted so\r\npromptly the Soviet authorities must have wanted Marina to accompany\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Marina Oswald’s exit visa application was not\r\nacted upon with unusual rapidity. It took at least 5½ months from the\r\ntime the Oswalds applied until they were notified of permission in\r\nDecember 1961. There have been many instances where visas were granted\r\nmore quickly to other Soviet wives of American citizens.[A12-84]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Soviet authorities gave Oswald notice a month\r\nand a half in advance that they had granted him an exit visa, an\r\nunprecedented act for the Soviet Government.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding_--The Oswalds were notified on December 25,\r\n1961, that their requests for exit visas had been granted by Soviet\r\nauthorities. Marina Oswald picked up her visa, valid until December 1,\r\n1962, on January 11, 1962, 17 days after receiving notice that it was\r\navailable. Oswald did not pick up his visa until May 22. The Soviets\r\ndid not give the Oswalds any advance notice; the visas could have been\r\npicked up immediately had the Oswalds so desired. Because his exit visa\r\nhad a 45-day expiration time after date of issuance, Lee Oswald delayed\r\npicking it up until he knew when he was leaving. He could not arrange\r\na departure date until he received permission from the Department of\r\nState in May to return to the United States.[A12-85]\r\n\r\n\r\nOSWALD’S TRIP TO MEXICO CITY\r\n\r\nOswald’s trip to Mexico City in late September and early October 1963,\r\nless than 2 months before he assassinated President Kennedy, has\r\nprovoked speculation that it was related in some way to a conspiracy\r\nto murder the President. Rumors include assertions that he made a\r\nclandestine flight from Mexico to Cuba and back and that he received\r\na large sum of money--usually estimated at $5,000--which he brought\r\nback to Dallas with him. The Commission has no credible evidence that\r\nOswald went to Mexico pursuant to a plan to assassinate President\r\nKennedy, that he received any instructions related to such an action\r\nwhile there, or that he received large sums of money from any source in\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n_Speculation_--Oswald could not have received an American passport in\r\nJune 1963 within 24 hours without special intervention on his behalf.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding_--Oswald’s passport application was processed\r\nroutinely by the Department of State. No person or agency intervened\r\nspecially on his behalf to speed the issuance of the passport. The\r\npassports of 24 other persons, on the same list sent to Washington from\r\nNew Orleans, were authorized at the same time. The Passport Office of\r\nthe Department of State had no instructions to delay issuance of or to\r\ndeny a passport to Oswald.[A12-86]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The Walter-McCarran Act specifically requires anyone\r\nwho has attempted to renounce his U.S. citizenship to file an affidavit\r\nstating why he should receive a U.S. passport. Therefore, Oswald should\r\nhave been required to file such an affidavit before receiving his\r\npassport in June 1963.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The Internal Security Act of 1950\r\n(Walter-McCarran Act) contains no reference to an affidavit\r\nbeing required of a U.S. citizen who has attempted to expatriate\r\nhimself.[A12-87]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald did not have money for his trip to Mexico in\r\nSeptember 1963.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--An analysis of Oswald’s finances by the\r\nCommission indicates that he had sufficient money to make the trip\r\nto and from Mexico City. There is no evidence that he received any\r\nassistance in financing his trip to Mexico. The total cost of his 7-day\r\ntrip has been reliably estimated at less than $85.[A12-88]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald was accompanied on his trip to Mexico City by a\r\nman and two women.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Investigation has revealed that Oswald traveled\r\nalone on the bus. Fellow passengers on the bus between Houston and\r\nMexico City have stated that he appeared to be traveling alone and that\r\nthey had not previously known him.[A12-89]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--While in Mexico, Oswald made a clandestine flight to\r\nHavana and back.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The Commission has found no evidence that Oswald\r\nmade any flight to Cuba while he was in Mexico. He never received\r\npermission from the Cuban Government to enter Cuba nor from the Mexican\r\nGovernment to leave Mexico bound for Cuba. A confidential check of the\r\nCuban airline in Mexico City indicates that Oswald never appeared at\r\nits office there.[A12-90]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald came back from Mexico City with $5,000.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--No evidence has ever been supplied or obtained\r\nto support this allegation. Oswald’s actions in Mexico City and after\r\nhis return to Dallas lend no support to this speculation.[A12-91]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--On November 27, 1963, in a speech at the University of\r\nHavana, Fidel Castro, under the influence of liquor, said “The first\r\ntime that Oswald was in Cuba * * *.” Castro therefore had knowledge\r\nthat Oswald had made surreptitious visits to Cuba.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Castro’s speeches are monitored directly by the\r\nU.S. Information Agency as he delivers them. A tape of this speech\r\nreveals that it did not contain the alleged slip of the tongue. Castro\r\ndid refer to Oswald’s visit to the “Cuban Embassy” in Mexico which he\r\nimmediately corrected to “Cuban consulate.” The Commission has found no\r\nevidence that Oswald had made surreptitious visits to Cuba.[A12-92]\r\n\r\n\r\nOSWALD AND U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES\r\n\r\nRumors and speculations that Oswald was in some way associated with\r\nor used by agencies of the U.S. Government grew out of his Russian\r\nperiod and his investigation by the FBI after his return to the United\r\nStates. Insinuations were made that Oswald had been a CIA agent or had\r\nsome relationship with the CIA and that this explained the supposed\r\nease with which he received passports and visas. Speculation that he\r\nhad some working relationship with the FBI was based on an entry in\r\nOswald’s notebook giving the name and telephone number of an agent from\r\nthe FBI office in Dallas. The Directors of the CIA and the FBI have\r\ntestified before the Commission that Oswald was never in the employ of\r\ntheir agencies in any capacity. The Commission has concluded on the\r\nbasis of its own investigations of the files of Federal agencies that\r\nOswald was not and had never been an agent of any agency of the U.S.\r\nGovernment (aside from his service in the Marines) and was not and had\r\nnever been used by any U.S. Government agency for any purpose. The FBI\r\nwas interested in him as a former defector and it maintained a file on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald was an informant of either the FBI or the CIA.\r\nHe was recruited by an agency of the U.S. Government and sent to Russia\r\nin 1959.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Mrs. Marguerite Oswald frequently expressed\r\nthe opinion that her son was such an agent, but she stated before\r\nthe Commission that “I cannot prove Lee is an agent.”[A12-93] The\r\nDirectors of the CIA and of the FBI testified before the Commission\r\nthat Oswald was never employed by either agency or used by either\r\nagency in any capacity. Investigation by the Commission has revealed no\r\nevidence that Oswald was ever employed by either the FBI or CIA in any\r\ncapacity.[A12-94]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald told Pauline Bates, a public stenographer in\r\nFort Worth, Tex., in June 1962, that he had become a “secret agent”\r\nof the U.S. Government and that he was soon going back to Russia “for\r\nWashington.”\r\n\r\n_Commission-finding._--Miss Bates denied a newspaper story reporting\r\nthat Oswald had told her that he was working for the U.S. Department of\r\nState. She stated that she had assumed incorrectly that he was working\r\nwith the Department of State when he told her that the State Department\r\nhad told him in 1959 that he would be on his own while in the Soviet\r\nUnion.[A12-95]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The FBI tried to recruit Oswald. An FBI agent’s name,\r\ntelephone number, and automobile license number were found among\r\nOswald’s papers.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--FBI officials have testified that they had never\r\ntried to recruit Oswald to act on behalf of the FBI in any capacity.\r\nThe Commission’s investigation corroborates this testimony. An FBI\r\nagent, James P. Hosty, Jr., had given his name and telephone number to\r\nMrs. Ruth Paine so that she could call and give him Oswald’s address in\r\nDallas when she learned it. Mrs. Paine and Marina Oswald have stated\r\nthat Mrs. Paine gave Oswald a slip of paper with the agent’s name and\r\ntelephone number on it. Marina Oswald had taken down the license number\r\nof Hosty’s car on one of his visits and given it to her husband.[A12-96]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Dallas police must have known where Oswald was living\r\nin the city because Mrs. Paine had given the address of Oswald’s room\r\non North Beckley Avenue to the FBI some time before the assassination.\r\n\r\n_Commission-finding._--Mrs. Paine had never given the address of\r\nOswald’s roominghouse to the FBI, nor had she known the address prior\r\nto the assassination. Therefore, the Dallas police could not have\r\nlearned the address from the FBI which did not know the address before\r\nthe assassination. The Dallas Police did not know that Oswald was in\r\nthe city before the assassination.[A12-97]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--It has been FBI policy for 20 years to inform employers\r\nof Communists or suspected Communists employed by them. It is a\r\nmystery, therefore, how Oswald retained his job at the Texas School\r\nBook Depository.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The FBI advised the Commission that it has\r\nnever been its policy to inform employers that they have Communists\r\nor suspected Communists working for them and that the FBI does\r\nnot disseminate internal security information to anyone outside\r\nthe executive branch of the U.S. Government. FBI agents had no\r\ncontacts with Texas School Book Depository officials until after the\r\nassassination.[A12-98]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Municipal and Federal police had observed Oswald\r\nclosely for some time but had not regarded him as a potential killer.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The Dallas police had not been aware of Oswald’s\r\npresence in the city before the assassination. The FBI knew that Oswald\r\nwas in Dallas from an interview with Mrs. Paine, but no FBI agents\r\nhad interviewed him there before the assassination. The FBI had not\r\nregarded him as a potential killer.[A12-99]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The FBI probably knew that Oswald had the rifle before\r\nthe President’s murder because it was most unlikely that it could have\r\ntraced the ownership of the rifle within 1 day if it had not already\r\nhad information on the rifle.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The FBI successfully traced the purchase of the\r\nrifle by Oswald within 24 hours of the assassination. It had had no\r\nprevious information about the rifle.[A12-100]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The FBI interviewed Oswald 10 days before the\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The last FBI interview with Oswald, before the\r\nassassination, took place in New Orleans in August 1963, when he asked\r\nto see an FBI agent after his arrest by police for disturbing the\r\npeace, the outcome of his distribution of Fair Play for Cuba handbills.\r\nNeither Special Agent Hosty nor any other FBI agent saw or talked with\r\nOswald between his return to Dallas, on October 3, and November 22.\r\nHosty did interview Mrs. Paine at her home about Oswald on November 1\r\nand 5, 1963. He also saw Marina Oswald briefly on November 1 at Mrs.\r\nPaine’s house, but he did not interview her.[A12-101].\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSPIRATORIAL RELATIONSHIPS\r\n\r\nRumors concerning accomplices and plots linked Oswald and Ruby with\r\neach other, or with others, including Patrolman J. D. Tippit, Gen.\r\nEdwin A. Walker, and Bernard Weissman of the nonexistent American\r\nFactfinding Committee, in a conspiratorial relationship. The Commission\r\nmade intensive inquiry into the backgrounds and relationships of Oswald\r\nand Ruby to determine whether they knew each other or were involved in\r\na plot of any kind with each other or others. It was unable to find\r\nany credible evidence to support the rumors linking Oswald and Ruby\r\ndirectly or through others. The Commission concluded that they were not\r\ninvolved in a conspiratorial relationship with each other or with any\r\nthird parties.\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Lee Harvey Oswald, Jack Ruby, and Patrolman J. D.\r\nTippit lived within a few blocks of each other.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Oswald’s room was 1.3 miles from Ruby’s\r\napartment and Tippit lived 7 miles away from Ruby. Tippit’s residence\r\nwas about 7 miles from Oswald’s room.[A12-102]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Since Oswald did not have the money to repay the\r\n$435.61 he had received from the Department of State to cover part of\r\nthe expenses of his return from Russia, he must have received help from\r\nsome other source. Ruby lent Oswald money to pay back the loan and lent\r\nhim small amounts of money thereafter.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The Commission has no credible evidence that\r\nOswald received any money from Ruby or anyone else to repay his\r\nState Department loan, nor that he received small amounts of money\r\nfrom Ruby at any time. An exhaustive analysis of Oswald’s income and\r\nexpenditures, made for the Commission by an Internal Revenue Service\r\nexpert, reveals that Oswald had sufficient funds to make the State\r\nDepartment repayments from his earnings.[A12-103]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Just before Oswald was shot by Ruby, he looked directly\r\nat Ruby in apparent recognition of him.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The Commission has been unable to establish as a\r\nfact any kind of relationship between Ruby and Oswald other than that\r\nOswald was Ruby’s victim. The Commission has examined television tapes\r\nand motion picture films of the shooting and has been unable to discern\r\nany facial expression that could be interpreted to signify recognition\r\nof Ruby or anyone else in the basement of the building.[A12-104]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The Dallas police suspected Oswald and Ruby of being\r\ninvolved in an attack on General Walker and planned to arrest the two\r\nwhen the FBI intervened, at the request of Attorney General Robert F.\r\nKennedy, and asked the police not to do so for reasons of state.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--This allegation appeared in the November 29,\r\n1963, issue (actually printed on November 25 or 26) of a German weekly\r\nnewspaper, Deutsche National Zeiting und Soldaten Zeitung, published\r\nin Munich. The allegation later appeared in the National Enquirer\r\nof May 17, 1964. The Commission has been reliably informed that the\r\nstatement was fabricated by an editor of the newspaper. No evidence\r\nin support of this statement has ever been advanced or uncovered. In\r\ntheir investigation of the attack on General Walker, the Dallas police\r\nuncovered no suspects and planned no arrests. The FBI had no knowledge\r\nthat Oswald was responsible for the attack until Marina Oswald revealed\r\nthe information on December 3, 1963.[A12-105]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Ruby and Oswald were seen together at the Carousel Club.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--All assertions that Oswald was seen in the\r\ncompany of Ruby or of anyone else at the Carousel Club have been\r\ninvestigated. None of them merits any credence.[A12-106]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald and General Walker were probably acquainted\r\nwith each other since Oswald’s notebook contained Walker’s name and\r\ntelephone number.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Although Oswald’s notebook contained Walker’s\r\nname and telephone number there was no evidence that the two knew each\r\nother. It is probable that this information was inserted at the time\r\nthat Oswald was planning his attack on Walker. General Walker stated\r\nthat he did not know of Oswald before the assassination.[A12-107]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Patrolman J.D. Tippit, Bernard Weissman, and Jack Ruby\r\nmet by prearrangement on November 14, 1963, at the Carousel Club.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Investigation has revealed no evidence to\r\nsupport this assertion. Nor is there credible evidence that any of the\r\nthree men knew each other.[A12-108]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Ruby’s sister, Mrs. Eva Grant, said that Ruby and\r\nTippit were “like two brothers.”\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Mrs. Grant has denied ever making this statement\r\nor any statement like it, saying it was untrue and without foundation.\r\nRuby was acquainted with another Dallas policeman named Tippit, but\r\nthis was G.M. Tippit of the special services bureau of the department,\r\nnot the Tippit who was killed.[A12-109]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Jack Ruby was one of the most notorious of Dallas\r\ngangsters.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--There is no credible evidence that Jack Ruby was\r\nactive in the criminal underworld. Investigation disclosed no one in\r\neither Chicago or Dallas who had any knowledge that Ruby was associated\r\nwith organized criminal activity.[A12-110]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The shooting in Dallas on January 23, 1964, of Warren\r\nA. Reynolds, who witnessed the flight of Patrolman Tippit’s slayer\r\non November 22 and followed him for a short distance, may have been\r\nconnected in some way with the assassination of President Kennedy and\r\nthe slaying of Patrolman Tippit. A man arrested for the attempt on\r\nReynolds, Darrell Wayne Garner, was released as a result, in part, of\r\ntestimony by Betty (Nancy Jane Mooney) MacDonald, who had allegedly\r\nworked at one time as a stripper at Jack Ruby’s Carousel Club.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--This rumor, originally publicized by a\r\nnewspaper columnist on February 23, 1964, was apparently based on the\r\nalleged connection between Betty MacDonald and the Carousel Club.\r\nInvestigation revealed no evidence that she had ever worked at the\r\nCarousel Club. Employees of the club had no recollection that she\r\nhad ever worked there. Betty MacDonald was arrested and charged with\r\ndisturbing the peace on February 13, 1964. After being placed in a cell\r\nat the Dallas city jail, she hanged herself. The Commission has found\r\nno evidence that the shooting of Warren Reynolds was in any way related\r\nto the assassination of President Kennedy or the murder of Patrolman\r\nTippit.[A12-111]\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER RUMORS AND SPECULATIONS\r\n\r\nMany rumors and speculations difficult to place in the categories\r\ntreated above also required consideration or investigation by the\r\nCommission. In some way or other, much of this miscellany was related\r\nto theories of conspiracy involving Oswald. The rest pertained to\r\nperipheral aspects that were of sufficient import to merit attention.\r\nThe Commission’s findings are set forth below.\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald was responsible in some way for the death of\r\nMarine Pvt. Martin D. Schrand.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--This rumor was mentioned by at least one of\r\nOswald’s fellow Marines. Private Schrand was fatally wounded by a\r\ndischarge from a riot-type shotgun while he was on guard duty on\r\nJanuary 5, 1958, near the carrier pier, U.S. Naval Air Station, Cubi\r\nPoint, Republic of the Philippines. The official Marine investigation\r\nin 1958 found that Schrand’s death was the result of an accidental\r\ndischarge of his gun and that no other person or persons were involved\r\nin the incident. The rumor that Oswald was involved in Schrand’s death\r\nin some way may have had its origin in two circumstances: (1) Oswald\r\nwas stationed at Cubi Point at the time of Schrand’s death; (2) on\r\nOctober 27, 1957, while stationed in Japan, Oswald accidentally shot\r\nhimself in the left elbow with a .22 derringer that he owned. The\r\nCommission has found no evidence that Oswald had any connection with\r\nthe fatal shooting of Private Schrand.[A12-112]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The Texas School Book Depository is owned and operated\r\nby the city of Dallas, and Oswald was therefore a municipal employee.\r\nAccordingly, he could have secured his job at the Depository only if\r\nsomeone in an official capacity vouched for him.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The Texas School Book Depository is a private\r\ncorporation unconnected with the city of Dallas. Oswald therefore was\r\nnot a municipal employee. He obtained his position at the Depository\r\nwith the assistance of Mrs. Ruth Paine, who learned of a possible\r\nopening from a neighbor and arranged an interview for him with\r\nSuperintendent Roy S. Truly at the Depository.[A12-113]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Prior to the assassination Dallas police searched other\r\nbuildings in the area of the Texas School Book Depository but not the\r\nSchool Book Depository itself.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The Dallas police and the Secret Service both\r\nnotified the Commission that, other than the Trade Mart, they had\r\nsearched no buildings along the route of the President’s motorcade or\r\nelsewhere in Dallas in connection with the President’s visit. It was\r\nnot Secret Service practice to search buildings along the routes of\r\nmotorcades.[A12-114]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Sheriff E. J. Decker of Dallas County came on the\r\npolice radio at 12:25 p.m. with orders to calm trouble at the Texas\r\nSchool Book Depository.\r\n\r\nCommission finding.--The final edition of the Dallas Times-Herald\r\nof November 22 (p. 1, col. 1) reported that “Sheriff Decker came on\r\nthe air at 12:25 p.m.” and stated: “‘I don’t know what’s happened.\r\nTake every available man from the jail and the office and go to the\r\nrailroad yards off Elm near the triple underpass.’” The article in the\r\nTimes-Herald did not mention the time that the President was shot. The\r\nradio log of the Dallas County Sheriff’s Office shows that Sheriff\r\nDecker came on the air at 40 seconds after 12:30 p.m. and stated:\r\n“Stand by me. All units and officers vicinity of station report to the\r\nrailroad track area, just north of Elm--Report to the railroad track\r\narea, just north of Elm.” The radio log does not show any messages\r\nby Sheriff Decker between 12:20 p.m. and 40 seconds after 12:30\r\np.m.[A12-115]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Police precautions in Dallas on November 22 included\r\nsurveillance of many people, among them some who did no more than speak\r\nin favor of school integration.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The Dallas Police Department notified the\r\nCommission that on November 22 it had no one under surveillance as\r\na precaution in connection with President Kennedy’s visit except at\r\nthe Trade Mart. The Commission received no evidence that the Dallas\r\npolice had under surveillance people who spoke in favor of school\r\nintegration.[A12-116]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald was seen at shooting ranges in the Dallas area\r\npracticing firing with a rifle.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Marina Oswald stated that on one occasion in\r\nMarch or April 1963, her husband told her that he was going to practice\r\nfiring with the rifle. Witnesses have testified that they saw Oswald\r\nat shooting ranges in the Dallas area during October and November\r\n1963. Investigation has failed to confirm that the man seen by these\r\nwitnesses was Oswald.[A12-117]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald could drive a car and was seen in cars at\r\nvarious places.\r\n\r\n_Commission-finding._--Oswald did not have a driver’s license.\r\nMarina Oswald and Ruth Paine have testified that he could not drive\r\na car, and there is no confirmed evidence to establish his presence\r\nat any location as the driver of a car. Mrs. Paine did give Oswald\r\nsome driving lessons and he did drive short distances on these\r\noccasions.[A12-118]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald received money by Western Union telegraph from\r\ntime to time for several months before the assassination of President\r\nKennedy.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--An employee in the Western Union main office in\r\nDallas, C. A. Hamblen, made statements that he remembered seeing Oswald\r\nthere on some occasions collecting money that had been telegraphed to\r\nhim. In his testimony before the Commission, Hamblen was unable to\r\nstate whether or not the person he had seen was Lee Harvey Oswald.\r\nWestern Union officials searched their records in Dallas and other\r\ncities for the period from June through November 1963 but found no\r\nmoney orders payable to Lee Oswald or to any of his known aliases. A\r\nWestern Union official concluded that the allegation was “a figment\r\nof Mr. Hamblen’s imagination.”[A12-119] The Commission has found no\r\nevidence to contradict this conclusion.[A12-120]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--On his way back from Mexico City in October 1963,\r\nOswald stopped in Alice, Tex., to apply for a job at the local radio\r\nstation.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--This rumor apparently originated with the\r\nmanager of radio station KOPY, Alice, who stated that Oswald visited\r\nhis office on the afternoon of October 4 for about 25 minutes.\r\nAccording to the manager, Oswald was driving a battered 1953 model car\r\nand had his wife and a small child in the car with him. Oswald traveled\r\nfrom Mexico City to Dallas by bus, arriving in Dallas on the afternoon\r\nof October 3. The bus did not pass through Alice. On October 4, Oswald\r\napplied for two jobs in Dallas and then spent the afternoon and night\r\nwith his wife and child at the Paine residence in Irving. Investigation\r\nhas revealed that Oswald did not own a car and there is no convincing\r\nevidence that he could drive a car. Accordingly, Oswald could not have\r\nbeen in Alice on October 4. There is no evidence that he stopped in\r\nAlice to look for a job on any occasion.[A12-121]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald or accomplices had made arrangements for his\r\ngetaway by airplane from an airfield in the Dallas area.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Investigation of such claims revealed that\r\nthey had not the slightest substance. The Commission found no\r\nevidence that Oswald had any prearranged plan for escape after the\r\nassassination.[A12-122]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--One hundred and fifty dollars was found in the dresser\r\nof Oswald’s room at 1026 North Beckley Avenue after the assassination.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--No money was found in Oswald’s room after the\r\nassassination. Oswald left $170 in the room occupied by his wife at the\r\nPaine residence in Irving. At the time of his arrest Oswald had $13.87\r\non his person.[A12-123]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--After Oswald’s arrest, the police found in his room\r\nseven metal file boxes filled with the names of Castro sympathizers.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--The Dallas police inventories of Oswald’s\r\nproperty taken from his room at 1026 North Beckley Avenue do not\r\ninclude any file boxes. A number of small file boxes listed in the\r\ninventory as having been taken from the Paine residence in Irving\r\ncontained letters, pictures, books and literature, most of which\r\nbelonged to Ruth Paine, not to Oswald. No lists of names of Castro\r\nsympathizers were found among these effects.[A12-124]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Oswald’s letters vary so greatly in quality (spelling,\r\ngrammar, sentence structure) that he must have had help in preparing\r\nthe better constructed letters or someone else wrote them for him.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--There is no evidence that anyone in the United\r\nStates helped Oswald with his better written letters or that anyone\r\nelse wrote his letters for him. His wife stated that he would write\r\nmany drafts of his more important letters. His mother indicated that\r\nhe would work hard over the drafts of some of his letters. It is clear\r\nthat he did take greater pains with some of his letters than with\r\nothers and that the contrasts in quality were accordingly substantial.\r\nIt is also clear that even his better written letters contained\r\nsome distinctive elements of spelling, grammar, and punctuation\r\nthat were common to his poorer efforts. Oswald wrote in his diary\r\nthat he received help from his Intourist Guide, Rima Shirokova, in\r\nthe preparation of his letter of October 16, 1959, to the Supreme\r\nSoviet.[A12-125]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--A Negro janitor who was a witness to the shooting and\r\nwas supposed to be able to identify Oswald as the killer was held in\r\nprotective custody by the Dallas police until he could appear before\r\nthe President’s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Investigation revealed that this story had no\r\nfoundation in fact. No such witness was kept in protective custody by\r\nthe Dallas police for appearance before the Commission. The story had\r\nits origin in a newspaper account based on hearsay.[A12-126]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The Secret Service incarcerated Marina Oswald\r\nimmediately after the assassination.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Marina Oswald was given protection by the Secret\r\nService for a period of time after the assassination. She had freedom\r\nto communicate with others at anytime she desired, to go where she\r\npleased, or to terminate the protection at any time.[A12-127]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--Mrs. Marguerite Oswald was shown a photograph of Jack\r\nRuby by an FBI agent the night before Ruby killed her son.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--On the night of November 23, 1963, Special Agent\r\nBardwell D. Odum of the FBI showed Mrs. Marguerite Oswald a picture\r\nof a man to determine whether the man was known to her. Mrs. Oswald\r\nstated subsequently that the picture was of Jack Ruby. The Commission\r\nhas examined a copy of the photograph and determined that it was not a\r\npicture of Jack Ruby.[A12-128]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The son of the only witness to the Tippit slaying was\r\narrested after talking to some private investigators and soon plunged\r\nto his death from an unbarred jail window.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--According to Mrs. Helen Markham, one of the\r\nwitnesses to the Tippit slaying, Mrs. Marguerite Oswald and two men\r\nwho claimed to be reporters from Philadelphia sought to interview her\r\non June 27, 1964. Mrs. Markham did not wish to be interviewed and put\r\nthem off. Afterward, Mrs. Markham’s son, William Edward Markham, talked\r\nwith Mrs. Oswald and the men about the Oswald matter and the shooting\r\nof Patrolman Tippit. William Edward Markham had been in Norfolk, Va.,\r\nat the time of the assassination and had not returned to Dallas until\r\nMay 7, 1964. He had no personal knowledge of the shooting of Patrolman\r\nTippit. On June 30, 1964, another of Mrs. Markham’s sons, James Alfred\r\nMarkham, was arrested at Mrs. Markham’s apartment by Dallas Police on a\r\ncharge of burglary. While trying to escape, he fell from the bathroom\r\nof the apartment to a concrete driveway about 20 feet below. He was\r\ntaken to Parkland Memorial Hospital, treated for injuries, and after 6½\r\nhours was taken to jail. As of July 31, 1964, he was in Dallas County\r\nJail awaiting trial. There was also a warrant outstanding against him\r\nfor parole violation.[A12-129]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The headquarters detachment of the U.S. Army, under\r\norders from [Secretary of Defense Robert S.] McNamara’s office, began\r\nto rehearse for the funeral more than a week before the assassination.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--This assertion is based on an interview with\r\nU.S. Army Capt. Richard C. Cloy that appeared in the Jackson, Miss.,\r\nClarion-Ledger of February 21, 1964. The newspaper quotes Captain Cloy,\r\nwho was a member of the Army unit charged with conducting funeral\r\nceremonials in honor of deceased Chiefs of State, as having said that,\r\n“we were in a state of readiness and had just finished a funeral\r\nrehearsal because there was grave concern for President Hoover’s\r\nhealth. But we never expected that our practice was preparing us for\r\nPresident Kennedy.”[A12-130]\r\n\r\n_Speculation._--The ship in which Oswald went to Europe in 1959 stopped\r\nin Havana on the way.\r\n\r\n_Commission finding._--Oswald boarded the SS _Marion Lykes_ in New\r\nOrleans and it sailed on September 20, 1959. It docked in Le Havre,\r\nFrance, on October 8 with only one previous stop--at another French\r\nport, La Pallice.[A12-131]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XIII\r\n\r\nBiography of Lee Harvey Oswald\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY YEARS\r\n\r\nMarguerite Claverie, the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald, was born in\r\nNew Orleans in 1907,[A13-1] into a family of French and German\r\nextraction.[A13-2] Her mother died a few years after Marguerite was\r\nborn, leaving her and five other young children in the care of their\r\nfather, a streetcar conductor.[A13-3] Although Marguerite describes\r\nherself as “a child of one parent,” she recalls being “one of the\r\nmost popular young ladies in the [grammar] school,” and thinks of her\r\nchildhood as a “very full happy” one.[A13-4] Her older sister, Mrs.\r\nLillian Murret, remembers Marguerite as “a very pretty child, a very\r\nbeautiful girl,”[A13-5] as does a former acquaintance, Clem H. Sehrt,\r\nwho knew the Claveries.[A13-6] The family was poor but, according to\r\nMrs. Murret, was a “happy family * * * singing all the time.”[A13-7]\r\nMarguerite had 1 year of high school.[A13-8] Shortly before she was 17,\r\nshe went to work as a receptionist for a law firm in New Orleans.[A13-9]\r\n\r\nIn August 1929, while she was still working at the law firm, Marguerite\r\nmarried Edward John Pic, Jr.,[A13-10] a quiet man of her own age,\r\nwho worked as a clerk for T. Smith & Son, a New Orleans stevedoring\r\ncompany.[A13-11] The marriage was not a success, and by the summer of\r\n1931 she and Pic were separated.[A13-12] Marguerite was then 3 months\r\npregnant; she told her family that Pic did not want any children and\r\nrefused to support her.[A13-13] Pic ascribed the separation simply\r\nto their inability to get along together.[A13-14] A boy was born on\r\nJanuary 17, 1932, whom Marguerite named John Edward Pic.[A13-15] Pic\r\nsaw his son occasionally until he was about 1 year old; after that, he\r\ndid not see the boy again[A13-16] but contributed to his support until\r\nhe was 18 years old.[A13-17]\r\n\r\nDuring her separation from her first husband, Marguerite saw a\r\ngreat deal of Robert Edward Lee Oswald, an insurance premium\r\ncollector,[A13-18] who also was married but was separated from his\r\nwife.[A13-19] In 1933, Marguerite was divorced from Pic[A13-20] and,\r\nOswald’s wife also having obtained a divorce,[A13-21] they were married\r\nin a Lutheran church on July 20.[A13-22] Marguerite has described\r\nthe period of her marriage to Oswald as “the only happy part” of her\r\nlife.[A13-23] A son was born on April 7, 1934, who was named for\r\nhis father;[A13-24] Oswald wanted to adopt John Pic, but his mother\r\nobjected on the ground that John’s father might cut off the support\r\npayments.[A13-25] In 1938, the Oswalds purchased a new house on Alvar\r\nStreet for $3,900,[A13-26] in what John remembered as “a rather nice\r\nneighborhood.”[A13-27] The house was across the street from the William\r\nFrantz School,[A13-28] which first John and later both he and Robert,\r\nJr., attended.[A13-29] On August 19, 1939, little more than a year\r\nafter the Oswalds bought the Alvar Street house, Robert Oswald died\r\nsuddenly of a heart attack.[A13-30]\r\n\r\nTwo months later, on October 18, 1939, a second son was born.[A13-31]\r\nHe was named Lee after his father; Harvey was his paternal\r\ngrandmother’s maiden name.[A13-32] For a while after her husband’s\r\ndeath, Mrs. Oswald remained in the Alvar Street house without working;\r\nshe probably lived on life insurance proceeds.[A13-33] Sometime\r\nin 1940, she rented the house to Dr. Bruno F. Mancuso, the doctor\r\nwho had delivered Lee.[A13-34] (Dr. Mancuso continued to rent the\r\nhouse until 1944,[A13-35] when Marguerite obtained a judgment of\r\npossession against him.[A13-36] She sold the house for $6,500 to\r\nthe First Homestead and Savings Association, which resold it to Dr.\r\nMancuso.)[A13-37] She herself moved to a rented house at 1242 Congress\r\nStreet, where she lived for about half a year.[A13-38] For part of\r\nthis period after Oswald’s death, the two older boys were placed in\r\nthe Infant Jesus College, a Catholic boarding school in Algiers,\r\nLa., a suburb of New Orleans.[A13-39] Neither they nor their mother\r\nliked this arrangement,[A13-40] which John thought was intended to\r\nsave money;[A13-41] it lasted for less than a year, after which the\r\nboys returned to the school Frantz and then transferred to the George\r\nWashington Elementary School.[A13-42]\r\n\r\nOn March 5, 1941, Mrs. Oswald purchased a frame[A13-43] house at\r\n1010 Bartholomew Street, for $1,300.[A13-44] According to John’s\r\nrecollection, the neighborhood was not as pleasant as Alvar\r\nStreet; the house had a backyard, and the family kept a dog named\r\n“Sunshine.”[A13-45] A neighbor, Mrs. Viola Peterman, recalls that\r\nMrs. Oswald kept to herself but appeared to be “a good mother to her\r\nchildren.”[A13-46] She opened a shop in the front room, where she sold\r\nthings like sewing supplies and small groceries.[A13-47] Oswald’s\r\nNotion Shop, as it was called,[A13-48] failed to make money,[A13-49]\r\nand on January 16, 1942, Mrs. Oswald sold the house back to the Third\r\nDistrict Home Association, from which she had purchased it, for a\r\nprofit of $800.[A13-50]\r\n\r\nProbably in contemplation of the sale of the house, Mrs. Oswald\r\napplied in December 1941 to the Evangelical Lutheran Bethlehem Orphan\r\nAsylum Association for the admission of her two older sons to the\r\norphan asylum, known as the Bethlehem Children’s Home; she stated\r\non the application that she could contribute $20 per month to their\r\nmaintenance and would supply shoes and clothing.[A13-51] She had\r\ninquired also about Lee, who was too young to be admitted.[A13-52]\r\nJohn and Robert were accepted and entered the home on January 3,\r\n1942.[A13-53]\r\n\r\nMrs. Oswald moved to an apartment at 831 Pauline Street,[A13-54] and\r\nreturned to work. In December 1942, she listed her occupation as\r\n“telephone operator”;[A13-55] this may be the job she held at the\r\nPittsburgh Plate Glass Co., a company for which she worked at some\r\npoint during this period.[A13-56] She left Lee for much of this time\r\nwith his aunt, Mrs. Murret, who thought him a good looking, friendly\r\nchild, but could not devote a great deal of attention to him because\r\nshe had five children of her own.[A13-57] In the late spring of 1942,\r\nLee was watched for several weeks by Mrs. Thomas Roach, who lived with\r\nher husband in the same house as the Oswalds.[A13-58] Lee evidently\r\ndid not get along with Mrs. Roach who told the next occupant of the\r\nhouse that Lee was a bad, unmanageable child who threw his toy gun at\r\nher.[A13-59] Apparently referring to the Roaches, Mrs. Oswald testified\r\nthat she had once hired a couple to care for Lee; the couple neglected\r\nhim, so she “put them out” and cared for Lee herself until Mrs. Murret\r\nwas able to help her again.[A13-60] Soon after the incident with the\r\nRoaches, Mrs. Oswald moved again,[A13-61] this time to 111 Sherwood\r\nForest Drive, near the Murrets.[A13-62]\r\n\r\nMrs. Murret took care of Lee for several months longer. Near Lee’s\r\nthird birthday, Mrs. Oswald again inquired about his admission into the\r\nBethlehem Children’s Home,[A13-63] perhaps because a disagreement with\r\nher sister made it impossible to leave him with her any longer.[A13-64]\r\nHe was admitted on December 26.[A13-65] On his application, Mrs. Oswald\r\nagreed to contribute $10 per month and to supply shoes and clothing, as\r\nfor the other boys.[A13-66]\r\n\r\nLee remained in the home for about 13 months, but according to John’s\r\ntestimony, left on several occasions to spend short periods of time\r\nwith his mother or the Murrets.[A13-67] John and Robert have pleasant\r\nmemories of the home,[A13-68] which apparently gave the children a good\r\ndeal of freedom.[A13-69] Robert described it as nondenominational but\r\nhaving “a Christian atmosphere”; “it might have been just a Protestant\r\nhome.”[A13-70] Mrs. Oswald visited them regularly,[A13-71] and they\r\noccasionally left the home to visit her or the Murrets.[A13-72]\r\n\r\nIn July 1943, Mrs. Oswald was hired to manage a small hosiery\r\nstore.[A13-73] This is probably the store to which she referred in her\r\ntestimony as the “Princess Hosiery Shop on Canal Street,” at which, she\r\ntestified, she was left by herself and “in 6 days’ time * * * hired\r\nfour girls.”[A13-74] Her employer remembers her as a neat, attractive,\r\nand hardworking woman, an aggressive person who would make a good\r\nmanager.[A13-75] She was not good with figures, however, and after\r\nseveral months he discharged her.[A13-76] At about this same time, she\r\nmet Edwin A. Ekdahl, an electrical engineer older than herself, who was\r\noriginally from Boston but was then working in the area.[A13-77] They\r\nsaw each other often. Ekdahl met the boys[A13-78] and, according to\r\nJohn’s testimony, on at least one occasion, they all spent a weekend at\r\na summer resort area in Covington, La.[A13-79]\r\n\r\nBy January 1944, Mrs. Oswald and Ekdahl had decided to marry.[A13-80]\r\nShe withdrew Lee from the Children’s Home[A13-81] and moved with him\r\nto Dallas, where Ekdahl expected to be located.[A13-82] They planned\r\nto postpone the marriage until the end of the school year so that\r\nthe older boys could complete the year at the home before they left\r\nit.[A13-83] In the meantime, she would care for Ekdahl,[A13-84] who was\r\nrecovering from a serious illness, probably a heart attack.[A13-85]\r\nMrs. Oswald has testified that when she arrived in Dallas, she decided\r\nthat she did not want to marry Ekdahl after all.[A13-86] Using part\r\nof the proceeds from the sale of the Alvar Street house,[A13-87] she\r\npurchased a house at 4801 Victor Street,[A13-88] a portion of which she\r\nrented.[A13-89] In June, John and Robert left the Children’s Home and\r\njoined their mother in Dallas.[A13-90] They entered the nearby Davy\r\nCrockett Elementary School the following September.[A13-91]\r\n\r\nEkdahl visited Mrs. Oswald on weekends and stayed at Victor\r\nStreet.[A13-92] By the following year she had resolved her doubts about\r\nmarrying him, influenced in part by his substantial income[A13-93]\r\nand perhaps by the visit some time earlier of his sister, who favored\r\nthe marriage because of his ill health.[A13-94] Explaining that she\r\nexpected to travel a great deal, Mrs. Oswald tried unsuccessfully to\r\nreturn the older boys to the home in February 1945.[A13-95] She and\r\nEkdahl were married in May.[A13-96] After a brief honeymoon, they\r\nreturned to Victor Street.[A13-97]\r\n\r\nEkdahl got along well with the boys, on whom he lavished much\r\nattention.[A13-98] John testified that Ekdahl treated them as if they\r\nwere his own children and that Lee seemed to find in Ekdahl “the father\r\nhe never had”; John recalled that on one occasion he told Lee that\r\nEkdahl and his mother had become reconciled after a separation, and\r\nthat “this seemed to really elate Lee, this made him really happy that\r\nthey were getting back together.”[A13-99]\r\n\r\nBecause Ekdahl’s business required him to make frequent trips, in\r\nSeptember, John and Robert were placed in the Chamberlain-Hunt\r\nMilitary Academy at Port Gibson, Miss.;[A13-100] their mother paid the\r\ntuition herself, using the proceeds from the sale of the Alvar Street\r\nproperty.[A13-101] They remained at the academy for the next 3 years,\r\nreturning home only for vacations.[A13-102] Lee accompanied his parents\r\non their travels.[A13-103] Mrs. Myrtle Evans, who had known both\r\nMarguerite and Ekdahl before their marriage,[A13-104] testified that\r\nMarguerite insisted on keeping Lee with her; Mrs. Evans thought that\r\nMarguerite was “too close” to Lee and “spoiled him to death,” which\r\nhurt her marriage to Ekdahl.[A13-105]\r\n\r\nSometime in the fall after John and Robert were at boarding school,\r\nthe Ekdahls moved to Benbrook, a suburb of Fort Worth, where they\r\nlived on Granbury Road,[A13-106] in a house of stone or brick, set on\r\na large plot of land.[A13-107] Records of the Benbrook Common School\r\nshow Lee’s admission into the first grade on October 31; his birth date\r\nis incorrectly given as July 9, 1939, his mother presumably having\r\ngiven that date to satisfy the age requirement.[A13-108] On February\r\n8, 1946, he was admitted to the Harris Hospital in Fort Worth with\r\n“acute mastoiditis.”[A13-109] A mastoidectomy was performed without\r\ncomplications, and Lee left the hospital in 4 days.[A13-110] (In 1955,\r\nLee indicated on a school form that he had an “abnormal ear drum in\r\nleft ear,”[A13-111] presumably a reference to the mastoidectomy;\r\nbut when he entered the Marines 1 year later, physical examination\r\ndisclosed no physical defects.)[A13-112]\r\n\r\nThe Ekdahls’ marriage quickly broke down. Before they had been married\r\na year, Marguerite suspected Ekdahl of infidelity.[A13-113] She\r\nthought him stingy,[A13-114] and there were frequent arguments about\r\nhis insistence that she account for her expenditures and his refusal\r\nto share his money with her.[A13-115] In the summer of 1946, she left\r\nEkdahl, picked up John and Robert at Chamberlain-Hunt, and moved with\r\nthe boys to Covington, La.,[A13-116] where they lived for at least part\r\nof the time at 311 Vermont Street. [A13-117] Mrs. Evans described them\r\nat Covington, possibly during this summer, as “really a happy family”;\r\nLee seemed like a normal boy but “kept to himself” and seemed not “to\r\nwant to be with any other children.”[A13-118] The separation continued\r\nafter the two boys returned to boarding school, and in September Lee\r\nwas enrolled in the Covington Elementary School.[A13-119] His record at\r\nBenbrook had been satisfactory--he was present on 82 school days and\r\nabsent on 15, and received all A’s and B’s[A13-120]--but he had not\r\ncompleted the work of the first grade, in which he was enrolled for a\r\nsecond time.[A13-121]\r\n\r\nLee received no grades at the Covington School, from which he was\r\nwithdrawn on January 23, 1947,[A13-122] because his parents, now\r\nreconciled, were moving to Fort Worth, where they lived at 1505 Eighth\r\nAvenue.[A13-123] Four days later, he enrolled in the Clayton Public\r\nSchool; he was still in the first grade, which he completed in May with\r\nB’s in every subject except physical education and health, in which\r\nhe received A’s.[A13-124] In the fall, he entered the second grade in\r\nthe same school but, relations between his parents having deteriorated\r\nagain, was withdrawn before any grades were recorded.[A13-125]\r\n\r\nAfter the move to Fort Worth, the Ekdahls continued to argue\r\nfrequently; according to John, “they would have a fight about every\r\nother day and he would leave and come back.”[A13-126] That summer,\r\nMarguerite obtained what she regarded as proof that Ekdahl was having\r\nsome sort of affair. According to her testimony, a neighbor told\r\nher that Ekdahl had been living on Eighth Avenue with another woman\r\nwhile she was in Covington.[A13-127] Then, at a time when Ekdahl was\r\nsupposed to be out of town,[A13-128] she went with John and several of\r\nhis friends to an apartment in Fort Worth; one of the boys posed as a\r\ntelegram carrier, and when the door opened she pushed her way into the\r\napartment and found Ekdahl in his shirt sleeves in the company of a\r\nwoman in a negligee.[A13-129]\r\n\r\nDespite this apparent confirmation of her suspicions, Marguerite\r\ncontinued to live with Ekdahl until January 1948.[A13-130] In\r\nJanuary, according to Ekdahl’s allegations in the subsequent divorce\r\nproceedings, she “directed * * * [him] to leave the home immediately\r\nand never to return,” which he did.[A13-131] Ekdahl filed suit for\r\ndivorce in March.[A13-132] The complaint alleged that Marguerite\r\nconstantly nagged Ekdahl and argued “with reference to money matters,”\r\naccused him of infidelity, threw things at him, and finally ordered him\r\nout of the house; that these acts were unprovoked by Ekdahl’s conduct\r\ntoward her; that her acts endangered his already impaired health; and\r\nthat her “excesses, harsh and cruel treatment and outrages” toward him\r\nmade it impossible for them to live together.[A13-133] She denied all\r\nthese allegations.[A13-134] After a trial, at which John testified\r\nand, he thought, Lee was called to the stand but was excused without\r\ntestifying,[A13-135] the jury found on special issues that Marguerite\r\nwas “guilty of excesses, cruel treatment, or outrages” unprovoked by\r\nEkdahl’s conduct.[A13-136] On June 24, the court granted the divorce\r\nand approved an agreement between the parties disposing of their\r\nproperty between them and awarding Marguerite $1,500; at her request,\r\nthe divorce restored to Marguerite her former name, Marguerite C.\r\nOswald.[A13-137]\r\n\r\nWhile the divorce suit was pending, Marguerite moved from Eighth Avenue\r\nto a house on 3300 Willing Street, next to railroad tracks.[A13-138]\r\nThe boys found her there in May when they returned from the military\r\nacademy; for John, the move signified that they “were back down in the\r\nlower class again.”[A13-139] Lee’s withdrawal from the Clayton School\r\non March 18, 1948,[A13-140] probably coincided with the move to Willing\r\nStreet. He entered the Clark Elementary School on the following day,\r\nand in June completed the second grade with a record mostly of B’s\r\nand A’s.[A13-141] Philip Vinson, a classmate at the Clayton School,\r\nhas described Lee at that time as “a quiet type of kid,” who “didn’t\r\nmake a lot of noise.”[A13-142] Lee was “stocky and well built,” which\r\nmade other boys look up to him and regard him as the leader of one of\r\ntheir schoolyard “gangs.”[A13-143] Vinson thought that Lee was not a\r\nbully and got along with his classmates, but had the impression that he\r\nrarely played with them or brought them home after school.[A13-144]\r\n\r\nShortly after the divorce, Mrs. Oswald purchased a small house in\r\nBenbrook, on what is now San Saba Street;[A13-145] John has testified\r\nthat it had a single bedroom, in which Lee slept with his mother, and\r\na screened porch where John and Robert slept.[A13-146] Mrs. Oswald\r\nworked at a department store in Fort Worth, and left the three boys\r\nhome alone.[A13-147] A neighbor, Mrs. W. H. Bell, has stated that Lee\r\nseemed to enjoy being by himself and to resent discipline;[A13-148]\r\nanother neighbor, Otis R. Carlton, stated that he once saw Lee chase\r\nJohn with a knife and throw it at him, an incident which, Carlton said,\r\ntheir mother passed off as a “little scuffle.”[A13-149] At the end of\r\nthe summer, Carlton purchased the property. He stated that he appraised\r\nit at $2,750 at Mrs. Oswald’s request; she then insisted that he had\r\nmade an offer to purchase at that price, which he finally agreed to\r\ndo.[A13-150]\r\n\r\nAfter the house was sold, the family returned to Fort Worth, a move\r\nnecessitated by Mrs. Oswald’s, and now John’s, employment.[A13-151]\r\nMrs. Oswald bought a two-bedroom, frame house at 7408 Ewing, from which\r\nRobert and Lee could walk to school.[A13-152] John, who was then 16,\r\nobtained a job as a shoe stockboy at Everybody’s Department Store; he\r\ntestified that he wanted to finish high school at the military academy,\r\nbut that his mother advised him to leave school and help to support\r\nthe family.[A13-153] He gave her $15 per week out of his salary of\r\n$25.[A13-154] Robert returned to school.[A13-155]\r\n\r\nLee entered the third grade at the Arlington Heights Elementary\r\nSchool.[A13-156] He remained at Arlington Heights for the entire\r\nschool year, completing the third grade with a satisfactory record,\r\nwhich included A’s in social studies, citizenship, elementary science,\r\nart, and music, and a D in spelling.[A13-157] In September 1949, he\r\ntransferred to the Ridglea West Elementary School, where he remained\r\nfor the next 3 years.[A13-158] Lee’s record at Ridglea is not\r\nremarkable in any respect. In the fourth and fifth grades, he received\r\nmostly B’s; in the sixth grade, B’s and C’s predominate.[A13-159]\r\nHe received D’s in both the fifth and sixth grades in spelling and\r\narithmetic; in the fourth and sixth grades, C’s are recorded for\r\nSpanish,[A13-160] which may account for his rudimentary familiarity\r\nwith that language later on.[A13-161] In the fourth grade his IQ was\r\nrecorded at 103; on achievement tests in each of the 3 years, he twice\r\ndid best in reading and twice did worst in spelling.[A13-162]\r\n\r\nLee is generally characterized as an unexceptional but rather\r\nsolitary boy during these years. His mother worked in a variety of\r\njobs,[A13-163] and, according to her own testimony, told Lee not to\r\ncontact her at work except in an emergency.[A13-164] He ordinarily\r\nreturned home alone directly after school, in obedience to his\r\nmother’s instructions.[A13-165] A fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Clyde I.\r\nLivingston, described him as a lonely boy, quiet and shy, who did not\r\neasily form friendships with other students.[A13-166] But Richard W.\r\nGarrett has stated that he was a classmate of Lee in the fourth or\r\nfifth grade and found him easy to get along with; he recalled playing\r\nwith Lee often at school and sometimes walking home together with\r\nhim.[A13-167] Mrs. Livingston recalled that at Christmas 1949, Lee gave\r\nher a puppy and afterward came to her home to see the puppy and talk to\r\nher and her family.[A13-168]\r\n\r\nLee’s relationship with his brothers was good but limited by the\r\ndifference in their ages.[A13-169] He still had a dog,[A13-170] but\r\nthere were few children of his age in the neighborhood, and he appears\r\nto have been by himself after school most of the time.[A13-171] He read\r\na lot,[A13-172] had a stamp collection, and played chess and Monopoly\r\nwith his brothers.[A13-173] Mrs. Murret remembered that on a visit to\r\nher home in New Orleans, Lee refused to play with other children or\r\neven to leave the house; he preferred to stay indoors and read (mostly\r\n“funnybooks”) or listen to the radio.[A13-174] After several weeks\r\nwith the Murrets, Lee wrote to his mother and asked her to come for\r\nhim.[A13-175] Hiram Conway, a neighbor on Ewing Street, thought Lee\r\nwas an intelligent child, who picked things up easily; although he did\r\nnot recall many specific incidents to support his impressions, Conway\r\nregarded Lee as “a bad kid,” who was “quick to anger” and “mean when\r\nhe was angry, just ornery.”[A13-176] John’s general picture of Lee in\r\nthese years is that of “a normal healthy robust boy who would get in\r\nfights and still have his serious moments.”[A13-177]\r\n\r\nJohn returned to high school in January 1949, but continued to work\r\npart time.[A13-178] Early in 1950, he entered the Coast Guard.[A13-179]\r\nRobert left school soon after John’s departure and went to work\r\nfull time, contributing most of his earnings to the support of\r\nhis family.[A13-180] He returned to school in 1951-52, and after\r\ncompleting his junior year in high school, joined the Marines in July\r\n1952.[A13-181] In August, Mrs. Oswald and Lee moved to New York, where\r\nJohn was living with his wife and a very young baby in an apartment at\r\n325 East 92d Street; the apartment belonged to John’s mother-in-law,\r\nwho was temporarily away.[A13-182] Mrs. Oswald has explained that with\r\nRobert gone she did not want Lee to be alone while she worked and that\r\nshe went to New York City “not as a venture,” but because she “had\r\nfamily” there.[A13-183]\r\n\r\nThe visit began well. John testified of his meeting with Lee: “We met\r\nin the street and I was real glad to see him and he was real glad to\r\nsee me. We were real good friends.”[A13-184] He took about a week of\r\nleave and showed Lee the city; he remembered trips to the Museum of\r\nNatural History and Polk’s Hobby Shop, and a ride on the Staten Island\r\nferry.[A13-185] But when it became obvious that his mother intended to\r\nstay, the atmosphere changed. Mrs. Oswald did not get along with John’s\r\nwife, with whom she quarreled frequently.[A13-186] There was difficulty\r\nabout her failure to contribute anything towards her own and Lee’s\r\nsupport.[A13-187] According to John, his wife liked Lee and would have\r\nbeen glad to have him alone stay with them but felt that his mother set\r\nLee against her; they never suggested that Lee remain with them since\r\nthey knew that it would not work out.[A13-188] The visit ended when Lee\r\nthreatened Mrs. Pic with a pocket knife during a quarrel,[A13-189] and\r\nshe asked Mrs. Oswald to leave.[A13-190] John testified that during\r\nthis same quarrel Lee hit his mother, who appeared to have lost all\r\ncontrol over him.[A13-191] The incident permanently destroyed the good\r\nrelationship between Lee and his brother.[A13-192]\r\n\r\nMrs. Oswald and Lee moved uptown to a one-room basement\r\napartment[A13-193] in the Bronx, at 1455 Sheridan Avenue.[A13-194]\r\nWhile they were still at the Pics, he had been enrolled at the Trinity\r\nEvangelical Lutheran School on Watson Avenue.[A13-195] He was withdrawn\r\non September 26, after several weeks of irregular attendance, and 4\r\ndays later enrolled in the seventh grade of Public School 117, a junior\r\nhigh school.[A13-196] Mrs. Oswald found a job at one of the Lerner\r\nShops, a chain of dress shops for which she had worked briefly in Fort\r\nWorth several years before.[A13-197] In January, they moved again, to\r\n825 East 179th Street,[A13-198] and a few weeks later, she left the\r\nemploy of Lerner Shops.[A13-199] In April, she was working at Martin’s\r\nDepartment Store in Brooklyn, where she earned $45 per week;[A13-200]\r\nin May, she went to work for a chain of hosiery shops, with which she\r\nremained until December.[A13-201] Lee was registered at Public School\r\n117 until January 16, 1953,[A13-202] although the move to 179th Street,\r\nwhich took him out of that school district, probably took place before\r\nthat date.[A13-203] He had been at Public School 117 for 64 schooldays,\r\nout of which he had been present on 15 full and 2 half days;[A13-204]\r\nhe had received failing grades in most of his courses.[A13-205]\r\n\r\nLee’s truancy increased after he moved; he was now located in the\r\nschool district of Public School 44 but refused to go to school\r\nthere.[A13-206] On one occasion that spring, an attendance officer\r\nlocated Lee at the Bronx Zoo; the officer testified that Lee was\r\nclean and well dressed, but was surly and referred to the officer as\r\na “damned Yankee.”[A13-207] Several truancy hearings were held in\r\nJanuary, at the first of which at least, both Mrs. Oswald and Lee\r\nevidently failed to appear.[A13-208] At a hearing on January 27, by\r\nwhich time it was known that Lee was living in the Public School 44\r\ndistrict, it was decided to commence judicial proceedings if his\r\ntruancy continued.[A13-209] Meanwhile, on January 16, his mother called\r\nthe Community Service Society, to which she had been referred by the\r\nFederation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, and asked for an appointment\r\nto discuss the problem.[A13-210] She mentioned that a truancy hearing\r\nhad been held and said that Lee would not attend school despite the\r\nthreat of official action; she thought that his behavior was due to\r\ndifficulty in adjusting to his new environment.[A13-211] An appointment\r\nwas scheduled for January 30, but she failed to appear, and the case\r\nwas closed.[A13-212] Sometime in February, the Pics visited the\r\nOswalds. John testified that his mother told him about Lee’s truancy\r\nand asked how she could get Lee to accept psychiatric aid. Nothing came\r\nof these discussions.[A13-213]\r\n\r\nOn March 12, the attendance officer in charge of Lee’s case filed a\r\npetition in court which alleged that Lee had been “excessively absent\r\nfrom school” between October and January, that he had refused to\r\nregister at Public School 44 or to attend school there, and that he\r\nwas “beyond the control of his mother insofar as school attendance is\r\nconcerned.”[A13-214] On the same day, Mrs. Oswald appeared in court\r\nalone and informed the presiding judge that Lee refused to appear in\r\ncourt.[A13-215] Evidently impressed by the proceedings, however, Lee\r\ndid register at Public School 44 on March 23.[A13-216] Nevertheless,\r\non April 16, Justice Delany declared him a truant, and remanded him to\r\nYouth House until May 7 for psychiatric study.[A13-217]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the regular procedures at Youth House, Lee took\r\na series of tests and was interviewed by a staff social worker\r\nand a probation officer, both of whom interviewed Mrs. Oswald as\r\nwell.[A13-218] Their findings, discussed more fully in chapter VII of\r\nthe Commission’s report, indicated that Lee was a withdrawn, socially\r\nmaladjusted boy, whose mother did not interest herself sufficiently\r\nin his welfare and had failed to establish a close relationship with\r\nhim.[A13-219] Mrs. Oswald visited Lee at Youth House and came away\r\nwith a highly unfavorable impression; she regarded it as unfit for\r\nher son.[A13-220] On the basis of all the test results and reports\r\nand his own interview with Lee, Dr. Renatus Hartogs, the chief staff\r\npsychiatrist, recommended that Lee be placed on probation with a\r\nrequirement that he seek help from a child guidance clinic, and that\r\nhis mother be urged to contact a family agency for help; he recommended\r\nthat Lee not be placed in an institution unless treatment during\r\nprobation was unsuccessful.[A13-221]\r\n\r\nLee returned to court on May 7. He and his mother appeared before\r\nJustice McClancy, who discussed the Youth House reports with\r\nthem.[A13-222] He released Lee on parole until September 24, and\r\nrequested that a referral be made to the Community Service Society for\r\ntreatment.[A13-223] The probation officer called the society on the\r\nsame day but was told that it would probably not be able to take the\r\ncase because of its already full case load and the intensive treatment\r\nwhich Lee was likely to require;[A13-224] it confirmed this position 1\r\nweek later and closed the case on May 31.[A13-225] An application was\r\nmade to the Salvation Army also, which turned it down because it could\r\nnot provide the needed services.[A13-226]\r\n\r\nDuring the few weeks of school which remained, Lee attended school\r\nregularly, and completed the seventh grade with low but passing\r\nmarks in all his academic subjects.[A13-227] (He received a failing\r\nmark in a home economics course.)[A13-228] His conduct was generally\r\nsatisfactory and he was rated outstanding in “Social-Participation”;\r\nthe record indicates that he belonged to a model airplane club and had\r\na special interest in horseback riding.[A13-229] Robert Oswald visited\r\nNew York that summer, while he was on leave from the Marines.[A13-230]\r\nLee did not appear to him to be unhappy or to be acting abnormally,\r\nnor did Robert observe that relations between Lee and his mother were\r\nstrained.[A13-231] Lee’s truancy the previous fall and winter was\r\napparently discussed only in passing, when Mrs. Oswald mentioned that\r\nLee had had to appear before a judge.[A13-232]\r\n\r\nOn September 14, Lee entered the eighth grade at Public School\r\n44.[A13-233] His parole was due to end 10 days later. On September\r\n24, however, Mrs. Oswald telephoned the probation officer and advised\r\nthat she could not appear in court; she added that there was no need\r\nfor her to do so, since Lee was attending school regularly and was\r\nnow well adjusted.[A13-234] The parole was extended until October 29,\r\nbefore which date the school was to submit a progress report.[A13-235]\r\nThe report was highly unfavorable. Although Lee was attending school\r\nregularly, his conduct was unsatisfactory; teachers reported that he\r\nrefused to salute the flag, did little work, and seemed to spend most\r\nof his time “sailing paper planes around the room.”[A13-236] On October\r\n29, Mrs. Oswald again telephoned to say that she would be unable to\r\nappear. Justice Sicher continued Lee’s parole until November 19 and\r\ndirected the probation officer to make a referral to the Berkshire\r\nIndustrial Farm or Children’s Village.[A13-237]\r\n\r\nBefore the next hearing, Mrs. Oswald discussed Lee’s behavior with the\r\nschool authorities, who indicated to the probation officer that Lee’s\r\nbehavior improved considerably after her visit to the school.[A13-238]\r\nHe did, in fact, receive passing grades in most of his subjects in\r\nthe first marking period. His report also contains notations by his\r\nteachers that he was “quick-tempered,” “constantly losing control,”\r\nand “getting into battles with others.”[A13-239] Both Lee and his\r\nmother appeared in court on November 19. Despite Mrs. Oswald’s request\r\nthat Lee be discharged, Justice Sicher stated his belief that Lee\r\nneeded treatment, and continued his parole until January 28, 1954; the\r\nprobation officer was directed to contact the Big Brothers counseling\r\nservice in the meantime.[A13-240]\r\n\r\nAt the request of the probation officer, the Big Brothers office\r\ncontacted Mrs. Oswald in December, and on January 4 a caseworker\r\nvisited her and Lee at home.[A13-241] The caseworker reported that\r\nhe was cordially received but was told by Mrs. Oswald that continued\r\ncounseling was unnecessary; she pointed out to him that Lee now\r\nbelonged to the West Side YMCA, which he attended every Saturday. The\r\ncaseworker reported, however, that Lee was plainly “displeased with\r\nthe idea of being forced to join various ‘Y’ organizations about which\r\nhe cared little.” Mrs. Oswald declared her intention to return to\r\nNew Orleans and was advised to obtain Lee’s release from the court’s\r\njurisdiction before she left.[A13-242] On the following day, she called\r\nthe probation officer, who was away on vacation, and was advised by\r\nhis office again not to take Lee out of the jurisdiction without the\r\ncourt’s consent.[A13-243] The same advice was repeated to her by the\r\nBig Brothers caseworker on January 6. [A13-244] Through all these\r\ncontacts, Mrs. Oswald had evidenced reluctance to bring Lee into\r\ncourt, prompted probably by fear that he would be retained in some\r\nsort of custody as he had been at the time of the commitment to Youth\r\nHouse.[A13-245] Without further communication to the court, Mrs. Oswald\r\nand Lee returned to New Orleans sometime before January 10.[A13-246] On\r\nMarch 11, the court dismissed the case.[A13-247]\r\n\r\nIn New Orleans, Lee and his mother stayed with the Murrets at 757\r\nFrench Street while they looked for an apartment.[A13-248] Lee\r\nenrolled in the eighth grade at Beauregard Junior High School on\r\nJanuary 13[A13-249] and completed the school year without apparent\r\ndifficulty.[A13-250] He entered the ninth grade in September and again\r\nreceived mediocre but acceptable marks.[A13-251] In October 1954, Lee\r\ntook a series of achievement tests, on which he did well in reading\r\nand vocabulary, badly in mathematics.[A13-252] At the end of the\r\nschool year, on June 2, 1955, he filled out a “personal history.” He\r\nindicated that the subjects which he liked best were civics, science,\r\nand mathematics; those he liked least were English and art. His\r\nvocational preferences were listed as biology and mechanical drawing;\r\nhis plans after high school, however, were noted as “military service”\r\nand “undecided.” He said that reading and outdoor sports were his\r\nrecreational activities and that he liked football in particular. In\r\nresponse to the question whether he had “any close friends in this\r\nschool,” he wrote, “no.”[A13-253]\r\n\r\nLee is remembered by those who knew him in New Orleans as a quiet,\r\nsolitary boy who made few friends.[A13-254] He was briefly a member of\r\nthe Civil Air Patrol,[A13-255] and considered joining an organization\r\nof high school students interested in astronomy;[A13-256] occasionally,\r\nhe played pool or darts with his friend, Edward Voebel.[A13-257] Beyond\r\nthis, he seems to have had few contacts with other people. He read\r\na lot, starting at some point to read Communist literature which he\r\nfound at the public library;[A13-258] he walked or rode a bicycle,\r\nsometimes visiting a museum.[A13-259] Except in his relations with\r\nhis mother, he was not unusually argumentative or belligerent, but he\r\nseems not to have avoided fights if they came; they did come fairly\r\nfrequently, perhaps in part because of his aloofness from his fellows\r\nand the traces of a northern accent in his speech.[A13-260] His only\r\nclose friendship, with Voebel, arose when Voebel helped him tend his\r\nwounds after a fight.[A13-261] Friends of Mrs. Oswald thought that he\r\nwas demanding and insolent toward her and that she had no control over\r\nhim.[A13-262]\r\n\r\nWhile Lee was in the eighth and ninth grades, Mrs. Oswald worked\r\nfirst at Burt’s Shoestore[A13-263] and then at the Dolly Shoe\r\nCo.[A13-264] One of her employers at Dolly, where she worked as a\r\ncashier and salesclerk, remembered her as a pleasant person and\r\na good worker.[A13-265] At her request, the company hired Lee to\r\nwork part time; he worked there, mostly on Saturdays, for about\r\n10 weeks in 1955.[A13-266] On the “personal history” record which\r\nhe filled out in school, he stated that he had been a “retail\r\nshoesalesman”;[A13-267] but his employer recalled that they had tried\r\nto train him as a salesman without success and that he had in fact been\r\na stockboy.[A13-268]\r\n\r\nAfter a short period with the Murrets, Mrs. Oswald and Lee had moved\r\nto an apartment owned by Myrtle Evans at 1454 Saint Mary Street,\r\nwhich she and Mrs. Murret helped to furnish; later they moved to a\r\nless expensive apartment in the same building, the address of which\r\nwas 1452 Saint Mary Street.[A13-269] Relations between Mrs. Oswald\r\nand Mrs. Evans became strained,[A13-270] and in the spring of 1955\r\nthe Oswalds moved to a new apartment at 126 Exchange Place in the\r\nFrench Quarter.[A13-271] Although Lee gave the Exchange Place address\r\non a school form at the end of the ninth grade,[A13-272] the school\r\nauthorities had apparently not been advised of these moves earlier,\r\nbecause Mrs. Oswald did not want Lee to be transferred from Beauregard,\r\nwhich she considered a good school.[A13-273] During the summer of\r\n1955, Robert left the Marine Corps and spent a week with his mother\r\nand Lee in New Orleans before moving to Fort Worth; he found Lee\r\nunchanged.[A13-274]\r\n\r\nThat fall, Lee entered the 10th grade at Warren Easton High\r\nSchool.[A13-275] He had been there for about a month when he presented\r\nto the school authorities a note written by himself to which he had\r\nsigned his mother’s name. It was dated October 7, 1955, and read:\r\n\r\n  To whom it may concern,\r\n\r\n    Becaus we are moving to San Diego in the middle of this month\r\n    Lee must quit school now. Also, please send by him any papers\r\n    such as his birth certificate that you may have. Thank you.\r\n\r\n  Sincirely\r\n            Mrs. M. Oswald[A13-276]\r\n\r\nHe dropped out of school a few days later, shortly before his\r\n16th birthday.[A13-277] After his birthday, he tried to enlist in\r\nthe Marines, using a false affidavit from his mother that he was\r\n17.[A13-278] (Some years before, John Pic had joined the Marine\r\nCorps Reserve by means of his mother’s false affidavit that he was\r\n17.)[A13-279] The attempt failed, and, according to his mother’s\r\ntestimony, Lee spent the next year reading and memorizing the “Marine\r\nManual,” which he had obtained from Robert and “living to when he is\r\nage 17 to join the Marines.”[A13-280] He worked for the rest of the\r\nschool year. Between November 10 and January 14, he was a messenger boy\r\nfor Gerald F. Tujague, Inc., a shipping company, where he earned $130\r\nper month.[A13-281] His employer remembers him as a quiet, withdrawn\r\nperson.[A13-282] In January he worked briefly as an office boy for\r\nJ. R. Michels, Inc.[A13-283] For several months thereafter, he was a\r\nmessenger for the Pfisterer Dental Laboratory.[A13-284] His military\r\nrecord subsequently described his prior civilian jobs as follows:\r\n\r\n    Performed various clerical duties such as distributing mail,\r\n    delivering messages & answering telephone. Helped file records\r\n    & operated ditto, letter opening & sealing machines.[A13-285]\r\n\r\nAnticipating that Lee would join the Marines as soon as he was 17, Mrs.\r\nOswald moved in July 1956 to Fort Worth,[A13-286] where she took an\r\napartment at 4936 Collinswood for herself, Lee, and Robert.[A13-287] In\r\nSeptember, Lee enrolled in the 10th grade at the Arlington Heights High\r\nSchool[A13-288] but attended classes for only a few weeks. He dropped\r\nout of school on September 28.[A13-289] A few days later, he wrote the\r\nfollowing letter to the Socialist Party of America:\r\n\r\n            October 3, 1956\r\n\r\n  Dear Sirs;\r\n\r\n    I am sixteen years of age and would like more information about\r\n    your youth League, I would like to know if there is a branch\r\n    in my area, how to join, ect., I am a Marxist, and have been\r\n    studying socialist principles for well over fifteen months I am\r\n    very interested in your Y.P.S.L.\r\n\r\n  Sincerely\r\n\r\n            /s/ Lee Oswald[A13-290]\r\n\r\nAccompanying the letter was an advertisement coupon, on which he\r\nhad checked the box requesting information about the Socialist\r\nParty.[A13-291]\r\n\r\nLee became 17 on October 18. He enlisted in the Marines on October\r\n24.[A13-292]\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINES\r\n\r\nOn October 26, 1956, Lee Harvey Oswald reported for duty at the Marine\r\nCorps Recruit Depot in San Diego, Calif., where he was assigned to\r\nthe Second Recruit Training Battalion.[A13-293] He was 68 inches\r\ntall and weighed 135 pounds; he had no physical defects.[A13-294] On\r\nOctober 30, he took a series of aptitude tests, on which he scored\r\nsignificantly above the Marine Corps average in reading and vocabulary\r\nand significantly below the average in tests in arithmetic and pattern\r\nanalysis. His composite general classification score was 105, 2 points\r\nbelow the Corps average. He scored near the bottom of the lowest group\r\nin a radio code test.[A13-295] His preference of duty was recorded as\r\nAircraft Maintenance and Repair, the duty assignment for which he was\r\nrecommended.[A13-296]\r\n\r\nWhile he was at San Diego, Oswald was trained in the use of the M-1\r\nrifle.[A13-297] His practice scores were not very good,[A13-298] but\r\nwhen his company fired for record on December 21, he scored 212, 2\r\npoints above the score necessary to qualify as a “sharpshooter” on\r\na marksman/sharpshooter/expert scale.[A13-299] He did not do nearly\r\nas well when he fired for record again shortly before he left the\r\nMarines.[A13-300] He practiced also with a riot gun and a .45-caliber\r\npistol when he was in the Marines but no scores were recorded.[A13-301]\r\n\r\nOswald was given a 4.4 rating in both “conduct” and “proficiency” at\r\nthe Recruit Depot, the highest possible rating being 5.0 and an average\r\nrating of 4.0 being required for an honorable discharge.[A13-302] On\r\nJanuary 18, 1957, he reported to Camp Pendleton, Calif., for further\r\ntraining and was assigned to “A” Company of the First Battalion, Second\r\nInfantry Training Regiment.[A13-303] He was at Pendleton for a little\r\nmore than 5 weeks, at the end of which he was rated 4.2 in conduct\r\nand 4.0 in proficiency.[A13-304] Allen R. Felde, a fellow recruit who\r\nwas with Oswald at San Diego and Pendleton, has stated that Oswald\r\nwas generally unpopular and that his company was avoided by the other\r\nmen.[A13-305] When his squad was given its first weekend leave from\r\nPendleton, all eight men took a cab to Tijuana, Mexico. Oswald left\r\nthe others and did not rejoin them until it was time to return to\r\ncamp. Felde said that this practice was repeated on other trips to Los\r\nAngeles; Oswald accompanied the men on the bus to and from camp but did\r\nnot stay with them in the city.[A13-306] On February 27, he went on\r\nleave for 2 weeks,[A13-307] during which he may have visited his mother\r\nin Fort Worth.[A13-308]\r\n\r\nOn March 18, he reported to the Naval Air Technical Training Center\r\nat the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Fla.[A13-309] For the\r\nnext 6 weeks he attended an Aviation Fundamental School, in which\r\nhe received basic instruction in his specialty, including such\r\nsubjects as basic radar theory, map reading, and air traffic control\r\nprocedures.[A13-310] This course, as well as his next training\r\nassignment at Keesler Air Force Base, required Oswald to deal with\r\nconfidential material.[A13-311] He was granted final clearance up\r\nto the “confidential” level on May 3, “after [a] careful check\r\nof local records had disclosed no derogatory data.”[A13-312] He\r\ncompleted the course on the same day, ranking 46th in a class of\r\n54 students.[A13-313] On the previous day, he had been promoted to\r\nprivate, first class, effective May 1.[A13-314] At Jacksonville, he\r\nreceived ratings of 4.7 in conduct and 4.5 in proficiency, the highest\r\nratings he ever attained.[A13-315]\r\n\r\nOswald left for Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Miss., on the day\r\nhis course was completed;[A13-316] he traveled, probably by overnight\r\ntrain, in a group of six marines led by Pfc. Daniel P. Powers, the\r\nsenior marine in charge.[A13-317] At Keesler, he attended the Aircraft\r\nControl and Warning Operator Course, which included instruction in\r\naircraft surveillance and the use of radar.[A13-318] Powers was not\r\nsure whether he had met Oswald before the trip to Biloxi[A13-319] but\r\nremembers him there as “a somewhat younger individual, less matured\r\nthan the other boys,” who “was normally outside the particular group\r\nof marines that were in this attachment to Keesler.”[A13-320] (Oswald\r\nwas in fact 3 years younger than Powers.)[A13-321] Powers testified\r\nthat Oswald had the nickname “Ozzie Rabbit.”[A13-322] Oswald generally\r\nstayed to himself, often reading; he did not play cards or work out in\r\nthe gym with the others.[A13-323] He spent his weekends alone, away\r\nfrom the base; Powers thought he left Biloxi and perhaps went “home”\r\nto New Orleans, less than 100 miles away.[A13-324] He finished the\r\ncourse seventh in a class of 30 marines on June 17,[A13-325] and on\r\nJune 25, was given an MOS (military occupational specialty) of Aviation\r\nElectronics Operator.[A13-326] On June 20, he went on leave,[A13-327]\r\npossibly visiting his mother.[A13-328] His ratings at Keesler were 4.2\r\nin conduct and 4.5 in proficiency,[A13-329] which Powers thought was\r\n“pretty good.”[A13-330]\r\n\r\nOn July 9, Oswald reported at the Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro,\r\nCalif., near Santa Ana.[A13-331] He was classified as a replacement\r\ntrainee and attached to the Fourth Replacement Battalion.[A13-332] Six\r\nweeks later, on August 22, he departed from San Diego for Yokosuka,\r\nJapan, on board the U.S.S. _Bexar_.[A13-333] Powers testified that\r\nwhile on board, Oswald taught him to play chess, which they played\r\nfrequently, sometimes for more than 4 hours a day.[A13-334] Like\r\nmost of the men on board, Oswald read a lot from the books which\r\nwere available. Powers thought he read “a good type of literature,”\r\nremembering in particular Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass.”[A13-335]\r\n\r\nThe _Bexar_ docked at Yokosuka on September 12.[A13-336] Oswald\r\nwas assigned to Marine Air Control Squadron No. 1 (MACS-1), Marine\r\nAir Group 11, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, based at Atsugi, about 20\r\nmiles west of Tokyo.[A13-337] Oswald was a radar operator in MACS-1,\r\nwhich had less than 100 men.[A13-338] Its function was to direct\r\naircraft to their targets by radar, communicating with the pilots by\r\nradio.[A13-339] The squadron had also the duty of scouting for incoming\r\nforeign aircraft, such as straying Russian or Chinese planes, which\r\nwould be intercepted by American planes.[A13-340]\r\n\r\nOn October 27, when Oswald opened his locker to remove some gear, a\r\nderringer .22 caliber pistol fell to the floor and discharged; the\r\nbullet hit him in the left elbow.[A13-341] Paul Edward Murphy, a fellow\r\nmarine who was in the next cubicle, heard the shot, rushed in, and\r\nfound Oswald sitting on the locker looking at his arm; without emotion,\r\nOswald said to Murphy, “I believe I shot myself.”[A13-342] He was in\r\nthe naval hospital at Yokosuka until November 15.[A13-343]\r\n\r\nThe Judge Advocate General concluded that Oswald had “displayed a\r\ncertain degree of carelessness or negligence” by storing a loaded\r\nrevolver in his locker, but that his injury was incurred “in the line\r\nof duty” and was not the result “of his own misconduct.”[A13-344] He\r\nwas, however, charged with possession of an unregistered privately\r\nowned weapon in violation of general orders. A court-martial followed\r\non April 11, 1958, when Oswald’s unit returned from maneuvers, and on\r\nApril 29 he was sentenced to be confined at hard labor for 20 days, to\r\nforfeit $25 per month for 2 months, and to be reduced to the grade of\r\nprivate.[A13-345] The confinement was suspended for 6 months, after\r\nwhich that portion of the sentence was to be remitted.[A13-346]\r\n\r\nFive days after Oswald left the hospital, MACS-1 embarked aboard the\r\n_Terrell County_, LST 1157, for maneuvers in the Philippine Islands\r\narea,[A13-347] According to Powers’ recollection, the squadron was\r\nexpected to return to Atsugi after maneuvers were completed, but an\r\ninternational crisis developed; since another operation was scheduled\r\nfor a few months later, the squadron debarked at Cubi Point (Subic\r\nBay) in the Philippines and set up a temporary installation.[A13-348]\r\nWhile he was in the Philippines, Oswald passed a test of eligibility\r\nfor the rank of corporal;[A13-349] in a semiannual evaluation, however,\r\nhe was given his lowest ratings thus far: 4.0 in conduct and 3.9 in\r\nproficiency.[A13-350] The unit participated in exercises at Corregidor,\r\nfrom which it sailed for Atsugi on March 7, 1958, aboard the U.S.S.\r\n_Wexford County_, LST 1168.[A13-351] The _Wexford County_ reached\r\nAtsugi 11 days later.[A13-352]\r\n\r\nOswald was court-martialed a second time on June 27, for using\r\n“provoking words” to a noncommissioned officer (a sergeant) on June 20,\r\nat the Bluebird Cafe in Yamato, and assaulting the officer by pouring a\r\ndrink on him.[A13-353] The findings were that Oswald spilled the drink\r\naccidentally, but when the sergeant shoved him away, Oswald invited the\r\nsergeant outside in insulting language.[A13-354] Oswald admitted that\r\nhe was rather drunk and had invited the sergeant outside but did not\r\nrecall insulting him.[A13-355] He was sentenced to be confined at hard\r\nlabor for 28 days and to forfeit $55;[A13-356] in addition, suspension\r\nof the previous sentence of confinement was withdrawn.[A13-357] He\r\nwas in confinement until August 13.[A13-358] Meanwhile, a previously\r\ngranted extension of oversea duty was canceled,[A13-359] and he was\r\ngiven ratings of 1.9 in conduct and 3.4 in proficiency.[A13-360]\r\n\r\nOn September 14, Oswald sailed with his unit for the South China\r\nSea area; the unit was at Ping Tung, North Taiwan on September 30,\r\nand returned to Atsugi on October 5.[A13-361] On October 6, he was\r\ntransferred out of MACS-1 and put on general duty, in anticipation\r\nof his return to the United States.[A13-362] He spent several days\r\nthereafter in the Atsugi Station Hospital.[A13-363] On October\r\n31, he received his last oversea ratings: 4.0 in both conduct and\r\nproficiency.[A13-364]\r\n\r\nOswald appears generally to have been regarded by his fellows overseas\r\nas an intelligent person who followed orders and did his work well,\r\nbut who complained frequently.[A13-365] He did not associate much\r\nwith other marines and continued to read a great deal.[A13-366] Paul\r\nMurphy testified that Oswald could speak “a little Russian” while\r\nhe was overseas.[A13-367] Powers believed that Oswald became more\r\nassertive in Japan and thought that he might have had a Japanese girl\r\nfriend.[A13-368] He departed from Yokosuka on board the USNS _Barrett_\r\non November 2, and arrived in San Francisco 13 days later.[A13-369] On\r\nNovember 19, he took 30 days’ leave.[A13-370]\r\n\r\nOn December 22, Oswald was assigned to Marine Air Control Squadron No.\r\n9 (MACS-9) at the Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro, where he had\r\nbeen briefly before he went overseas.[A13-371] He was one of about\r\nseven enlisted men and three officers who formed a “radar crew,”\r\nengaged primarily in aircraft surveillance.[A13-372] This work probably\r\ngave him access to certain kinds of classified material, some of\r\nwhich, such as aircraft call signs and radio frequencies, was changed\r\nafter his defection to Russia.[A13-373] For part of his time at El\r\nToro, Oswald may have been assigned to clerical or janitorial tasks on\r\nthe base.[A13-374] Some of his associates believed rumors,[A13-375]\r\nincorrect according to official records,[A13-376] that he had lost his\r\nclearance to work on radar crews; one recalled hearing that Oswald\r\nhad once had clearance above the “confidential” level and had lost it\r\nbecause he “had poured beer over a staff NCO’s head in an enlisted club\r\nin Japan, and had been put in the brig.”[A13-377]\r\n\r\nThe officer in command of the radar crew, Lt. John E. Donovan, found\r\nhim “competent in all functions,” and observed that he handled\r\nhimself calmly and well in emergency situations.[A13-378] Donovan\r\nthought Oswald was not a leader but that he performed competently\r\non occasions when, as the senior man present, he served as crew\r\nchief.[A13-379] This estimate was generally shared by his fellows,\r\nmost of whom thought that he performed his assigned duties adequately\r\nbut was deficient in disciplinary matters and such things as barracks\r\ninspection.[A13-380] One of them recalled that after a number of bad\r\ninspections, the other members of Oswald’s quonset hut complained\r\nabout him and secured his transfer to another hut.[A13-381] He was\r\nthought to be an intelligent person, somewhat better educated and more\r\nintellectually oriented than other men on the base.[A13-382] A few\r\nof the men thought it more accurate to describe him as someone who\r\nwanted to appear intelligent.[A13-383] He had a pronounced interest in\r\nworld affairs, in which he appears to have been better informed than\r\nsome of the officers, whose lack of knowledge amused and sometimes\r\nirritated him; he evidently enjoyed drawing others, especially\r\nofficers, into conversations in which he could display his own superior\r\nknowledge.[A13-384]\r\n\r\nIt seems clear from the various recollections of those who knew him at\r\nEl Toro that by the time Oswald returned to the United States, he no\r\nlonger had any spirit for the Marines; the attitudes which had prompted\r\nhis enlistment as soon as he was eligible were entirely gone, and his\r\nattention had turned away from the Marines to what he might do after\r\nhis discharge. While no one was able to predict his attempt to defect\r\nto Russia within a month after he left the Marines, the testimony of\r\nthose who knew him at El Toro, in contrast to that of his associates\r\nin Japan, leaves no doubt that his thoughts were occupied increasingly\r\nwith Russia and the Russian way of life. He had studied the Russian\r\nlanguage enough by February 25, 1959, to request that he be given a\r\nforeign language qualification test; his rating was “poor” in all\r\nparts of the test.[A13-385] Most of the marines who knew him were aware\r\nthat he was studying Russian;[A13-386] one of them, Henry J. Roussel,\r\nJr., arranged a date between Lee and his aunt, Rosaleen Quinn, an\r\nairline stewardess who was also studying Russian.[A13-387] (Miss Quinn\r\nthought that Oswald spoke Russian well in view of his lack of formal\r\ntraining; she found the evening uninteresting.[A13-388] Donovan, with\r\nwhom she had a date later, testified that she told him that Oswald was\r\n“kind of an oddball.”)[A13-389] He read, and perhaps subscribed to, a\r\nnewspaper, possibly printed in Russian, which his associates connected\r\nwith his Russian bent.[A13-390]\r\n\r\nMost of those who knew him were able to recount anecdotes which suggest\r\nthat he was anxious to publicize his liking for things Russian,\r\nsometimes in good humor and sometimes seriously. Some of his fellows\r\ncalled him “Oswaldskovich,” apparently to his pleasure.[A13-391]\r\nHe is said to have had his name written in Russian on one of his\r\njackets;[A13-392] to have played records of Russian songs “so loud\r\nthat one could hear them outside the barracks”;[A13-393] frequently\r\nto have made remarks in Russian[A13-394] or used expressions like\r\n“da” or “nyet,”[A13-395] or addressed others (and been addressed)\r\nas “Comrade”;[A13-396] to have come over and said jokingly, “You\r\ncalled?” when one of the marines played a particular record of Russian\r\nmusic.[A13-397]\r\n\r\nConnected with this Russophilia was an interest in and acceptance of\r\nRussian political views and, to a lesser extent, Communist ideology.\r\nLess obvious to his fellows generally,[A13-398] it nevertheless led him\r\ninto serious discussions with some of them. Donovan, who was a graduate\r\nof the School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University,[A13-399]\r\nthought Oswald was “truly interested in international affairs”[A13-400]\r\nand “very well versed, at least on the superficial facts of a given\r\nforeign situation.”[A13-401] He recalled that Oswald had a particular\r\ninterest in Latin America[A13-402] and had a good deal of information\r\nabout Cuba in particular.[A13-403] Oswald expressed sympathy for\r\nCastro but, according to Donovan, “what he said about Castro was not\r\nan unpopular belief at that time.”[A13-404] Donovan believed that\r\nOswald subscribed to the Russian newspaper--which Donovan thought was\r\na Communist newspaper--not only in order to read Russian but also\r\nbecause he thought it “presented a very different and perhaps equally\r\njust side of the international affairs in comparison with the United\r\nStates newspapers.”[A13-405] Donovan was clear, on the other hand, that\r\nhe never heard Oswald “in any way, shape or form confess that he was a\r\nCommunist, or that he ever thought about being a Communist.”[A13-406]\r\n\r\nPrivate Kerry Thornley described himself as a close acquaintance,\r\nbut not a good friend, of Oswald, whom he met in the spring of\r\n1959;[A13-407] he later wrote an unpublished novel in which he drew\r\nheavily on his impressions of Oswald.[A13-408] Thornley generally\r\ncorroborates Donovan’s testimony but thought Oswald definitely believed\r\nthat “the Marxist morality was the most rational morality to follow”\r\nand communism, “the best system in the world.”[A13-409] Thornley\r\nthought this belief was “theoretical,” a “dispassionate appraisal”\r\nwhich did not indicate “any active commitment to the Communist ends”;\r\nhe described Oswald as “idle in his admiration for communism.”[A13-410]\r\nHe recalled discussions about Marxism in which Oswald criticized\r\ncapitalism and praised the Soviet economic system.[A13-411] Thornley\r\ntestified that his association with Oswald ended when, in response\r\nto Oswald’s criticism of a parade in which they both had to march,\r\nhe said “Well, comes the revolution you will change all that.”\r\nOswald, he said, looked at him “like a betrayed Caesar” and walked\r\naway.[A13-412] Thornley attributed Oswald’s decision to go to Russia\r\nto a growing disillusionment with the United States, especially its\r\nrole in the Far East, and a conviction that communism would eventually\r\nprevail.[A13-413] He was surprised by the decision but expected Oswald\r\nto adjust to Russian life and remain in Russia permanently.[A13-414]\r\n\r\nAnother marine, Nelson Delgado, met Oswald soon after the latter\r\narrived at El Toro.[A13-415] They were about the same age and had\r\nsimilar interests; Oswald enjoyed trying to speak Spanish with Delgado,\r\nwho spoke it fluently.[A13-416] Delgado regarded him as a “complete\r\nbeliever that our way of government was not quite right,” but did not\r\nthink he was a Communist.[A13-417] Their discussions were concerned\r\nmore with Cuba than Russia.[A13-418] They both favored the Castro\r\ngovernment and talked--“dreaming,” Delgado said--about joining the\r\nCuban Army or Government and perhaps leading expeditions to other\r\nCaribbean islands to “free them too.”[A13-419] Oswald told Delgado that\r\nhe was in touch with Cuban diplomatic officials in this country; which\r\nDelgado at first took to be “one of his * * * lies,”[A13-420] but later\r\nbelieved.[A13-421]\r\n\r\nOswald’s interest in Russia and developing ideological attachment to\r\ntheoretical communism apparently dominated his stay at El Toro. He\r\nwas still withdrawn from most of his fellows, although his special\r\ninterests appear to have made him stand out more there than he had at\r\nother posts and to have given him a source for conversation which he\r\nhad hitherto lacked.[A13-422] According to several of the witnesses,\r\nnames like “Ozzie Rabbit” still clung to him;[A13-423] others recalled\r\nno nickname or only shortened versions of his real name.[A13-424] His\r\nreading acquired direction; books like “Das Kapital” and Orwell’s\r\n“Animal Farm” and “1984” are mentioned in the testimony concerning\r\nthis period.[A13-425] He played chess;[A13-426] according to one of\r\nhis opponents he chose the red pieces, expressing a preference for the\r\n“Red Army.”[A13-427] He listened to classical music.[A13-428] For a\r\nshort time, he played on the squadron football team.[A13-429] According\r\nto Donovan, who coached the team, Oswald was not very good; he lacked\r\nteam spirit and often tried to call the plays, which was not his\r\njob.[A13-430] Delgado thought Oswald was a mediocre player.[A13-431]\r\nDonovan did not know whether Oswald quit or was thrown off the\r\nteam.[A13-432] He spent most of his weekends alone, as he had at\r\nKeesler, and did not leave the post as often as the other men.[A13-433]\r\nDelgado once rode with him on the train to Los Angeles but separated\r\nfrom him there; Oswald returned to the base after one night.[A13-434]\r\nDelgado recalls that on another weekend Oswald accepted his invitation\r\nto go to Tijuana: they stayed there for one night.[A13-435]\r\n\r\nAt the end of January 1959 and at the end of July, Oswald was given\r\nhis semiannual ratings, scoring 4.0 in conduct both times, and 4.0\r\nand 4.2 in proficiency.[A13-436] (The July ratings were repeated in\r\nSeptember, when he was transferred from MACS-9 in preparation for his\r\ndischarge.)[A13-437] On March 9, he was promoted as of March 1, to the\r\nrank of private, first class, for the second time.[A13-438] He took\r\na series of high school level general educational development tests\r\non March 23 and received an overall rating of “satisfactory.” His\r\nbest scores, in the 76th and 79th U.S. percentiles, were in English\r\ncomposition and physical sciences; his worst was English literature, in\r\nwhich he placed in the 34th percentile.[A13-439]\r\n\r\nIn the spring, Oswald applied to Albert Schweitzer College in\r\nChurwalden, Switzerland, for admission to the spring term in 1960;\r\nthe application is dated March 19.[A13-440] Schweitzer is a small\r\nschool, which specializes in courses in religion, ethics, science,\r\nand literature. He claimed a proficiency in Russian equal to 1\r\nyear of schooling[A13-441] and that he had completed high school\r\nby correspondence with an average grade of 85 percent.[A13-442] He\r\nlisted philosophy, psychology, ideology, football, baseball, tennis\r\nand stamp-collecting as special interests, and writing short stories\r\n“on contemporary American life” as his vocational interest.[A13-443]\r\nJack London, Charles Darwin, and Norman Vincent Peale were listed\r\nas favorite authors.[A13-444] He claimed membership in the YMCA\r\nand the “A.Y.H. Association,” and said that he had participated in\r\na “student body movement in school” for the control of juvenile\r\ndelinquency.[A13-445] Asked to give a general statement of his reasons\r\nfor wanting to attend the college, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    In order to aquire a fuller understanding of that subject which\r\n    interest me most, Philosophy. To meet with Europeans who can\r\n    broaden my scope of understanding. To receive formal Education\r\n    by Instructers of high standing and character. To broaden my\r\n    knowlege of German and to live in a healty climate and Good\r\n    moral atmosphere.[A13-446]\r\n\r\nOn the basis of these representations, Oswald’s application was\r\napproved by the college.[A13-447] He enclosed a registration fee of\r\n$25 in a letter dated June 19, in which he said that he was “looking\r\nforward to a fine stay.”[A13-448] Few of the other marines seem to have\r\nknown about this application. He told Delgado, however, that he planned\r\nto attend a Swiss school to study psychology, and Delgado knew that\r\nsome application had been made.[A13-449] Another marine, Richard Call,\r\nalso knew something of his plans.[A13-450]\r\n\r\nOswald was obligated to serve on active duty until December 7,\r\n1959 (the date having been adjusted to compensate for the period\r\nof confinement),[A13-451] On August 17, he submitted a request for\r\na dependency discharge, on the ground that his mother needed his\r\nsupport.[A13-452] The request was accompanied by an affidavit of Mrs.\r\nOswald and corroborating affidavits from an attorney, a doctor, and\r\ntwo friends, attesting that she had been injured at work in December\r\n1958, and was unable to support herself.[A13-453] Oswald had previously\r\nmade a voluntary allotment of part of his salary to his mother, under\r\nwhich arrangement she received $40 in August, and had submitted an\r\napplication for a “Q” allotment (dependency allowance) in her behalf\r\nof $91.30; one payment of the “Q” allotment, for the month of August,\r\nwas made in September.[A13-454] On August 28, the Wing Hardship or\r\nDependency Discharge Board recommended that Oswald’s request for a\r\ndischarge be approved;[A13-455] approval followed shortly.[A13-456]\r\nOn September 4, he was transferred from MACS-9 to the H. & H.\r\nSquadron,[A13-457] and on September 11, he was released from active\r\nduty and transferred to the Marine Corps Reserve, in which he was\r\nexpected to serve until December 8, 1962.[A13-458] He was assigned to\r\nthe Marine Air Reserve Training Command at the Naval Air Station in\r\nGlenview, Ill.[A13-459]\r\n\r\nAlmost exactly 1 year later, on September 13, 1960, Oswald was given an\r\n“undesirable discharge” from the Marine Corps Reserve,[A13-460] based\r\non:\r\n\r\n    reliable information which indicated that he had renounced his\r\n    U.S. citizenship with the intentions of becoming a permanent\r\n    citizen of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Further,\r\n    that petitioner brought discredit to the Marine Corps through\r\n    adverse newspaper publicity, which was generated by the\r\n    foregoing action, and had thereby, in the opinion of his\r\n    commanding officer, proved himself unfit for retention in the\r\n    naval service.[A13-461]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOVIET UNION\r\n\r\nOn September 4, the day on which he was transferred out of MACS-9 in\r\npreparation for his discharge, Oswald had applied for a passport at\r\nthe Superior Court of Santa Ana, Calif. His application stated that\r\nhe planned to leave the United States on September 21 to attend the\r\nAlbert Schweitzer College and the University of Turku in Finland,\r\nand to travel in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, England, France,\r\nGermany, and Russia.[A13-462] The passport was routinely issued 6 days\r\nlater.[A13-463]\r\n\r\nOswald went directly home after his discharge, and arrived in\r\nFort Worth by September 14.[A13-464] He told his mother that he\r\nintended to get a job on a ship or possibly in the “export-import\r\nbusiness.”[A13-465] If he stayed in Fort Worth, he said, he would be\r\nable to earn only about $30 per week; on a ship, he would earn “big\r\nmoney” and be able to send substantial amounts home.[A13-466] Three\r\ndays after he arrived in Fort Worth, he left for New Orleans.[A13-467]\r\nWhile he was in Fort Worth he had registered his dependency discharge\r\nand entry into the Marine Reserve at the Fort Worth Selective Service\r\nBoard,[A13-468] and visited his brother Robert and his family.[A13-469]\r\nHe also gave his mother $100.[A13-470]\r\n\r\nOn September 17, Oswald spoke with a representative of Travel\r\nConsultants, Inc., a New Orleans travel bureau; he filled out a\r\n“Passenger Immigration Questionnaire,” on which he gave his occupation\r\nas “shipping export agent” and said that he would be abroad for 2\r\nmonths on a pleasure trip. He booked passage from New Orleans to Le\r\nHavre, France, on a freighter, the SS _Marion Lykes_, scheduled to sail\r\non September 18, for which he paid $220.75.[A13-471] On the evening of\r\nSeptember 17, he registered at the Liberty Hotel.[A13-472]\r\n\r\nThe _Marion Lykes_ did not sail until the early morning of September\r\n20.[A13-473] Before its departure, Oswald wrote his mother a letter,\r\nwhich was her last news of him until she read stories of his defection\r\nin Fort Worth newspapers:\r\n\r\n  Dear Mother:\r\n\r\n    Well, I have booked passage on a ship to Europe, I would of\r\n    had to sooner or later and I think it’s best I go now. Just\r\n    remember above all else that my values are very different from\r\n    Robert’s or your’s. It is difficult to tell you how I feel,\r\n    Just remember this is what I must do. I did not tell you about\r\n    my plans because you could hardly be expected to understand.\r\n\r\n    I did not see aunt Lilian while I was here. I will write again\r\n    as soon as I land.\r\n\r\n            Lee[A13-474]\r\n\r\nThe _Marion Lykes_ carried only four passengers.[A13-475] Oswald shared\r\nhis cabin with Billy Joe Lord, a young man who had just graduated from\r\nhigh school and was going to France to continue his education. Lord\r\ntestified that he and Oswald did not discuss politics but did have a\r\nfew amicable religious arguments, in which Oswald defended atheism.\r\nOswald was “standoffish,” but told Lord generally about his background,\r\nmentioning that his mother worked in a drugstore in Fort Worth and that\r\nhe was bitter about the low wages which she received. He told Lord that\r\nhe intended to travel in Europe and possibly to attend school in Sweden\r\nor Switzerland if he had sufficient funds.[A13-476] The other two\r\npassengers were Lt. Col. and Mrs. George B. Church, Jr., who also found\r\nOswald unfriendly and had little contact with him. Oswald told them\r\nthat he had not liked the Marine Corps and that he planned to study\r\nin Switzerland; they observed some “bitterness” about his mother’s\r\ndifficulties, but did not discuss this with him. No one on board\r\nsuspected that he intended to defect to Russia.[A13-477]\r\n\r\nOswald disembarked at Le Havre on October 8. He left for England that\r\nsame day, and arrived on October 9.[A13-478] He told English customs\r\nofficials in Southampton that he had $700 and planned to remain in the\r\nUnited Kingdom for 1 week before proceeding to a school in Switzerland.\r\nBut on the same day, he flew to Helsinki, Finland, where he registered\r\nat the Torni Hotel; on the following day, he moved to the Klaus Kurki\r\nHotel.[A13-479]\r\n\r\nOswald probably applied for a visa at the Russian consulate on October\r\n12, his first business day in Helsinki.[A13-480] The visa was issued\r\non October 14. It was valid until October 20 and permitted him to take\r\none trip of not more than 6 days to the Soviet Union.[A13-481] He also\r\npurchased 10 Soviet “tourist vouchers” which cost $30 apiece.[A13-482]\r\nHe left Helsinki by train on the following day, crossed the\r\nFinnish-Russian border at Vainikkala, and arrived in Moscow on October\r\n16.[A13-483]\r\n\r\nHe was met at the Moscow railroad station by a representative of\r\n“Intourist,” the state tourist agency, and taken to the Hotel Berlin,\r\nwhere he registered as a student.[A13-484] On the same day he met the\r\nIntourist guide assigned to him during his stay in Russia, a young\r\nwoman named Rima Shirokova. They went sightseeing the next day. Almost\r\nimmediately he told her that he wanted to leave the United States and\r\nbecome a citizen of the Soviet Union. According to Oswald’s “Historic\r\nDiary,” she later told him that she had reported his statement to\r\nIntourist headquarters, which in turn had notified the “Passport and\r\nVisa Office” (probably the Visa and Registration Department of the\r\nMinistry of Internal Affairs, the MVD[A13-485]). She was instructed\r\nto help Oswald prepare a letter to the Supreme Soviet requesting that\r\nhe be granted citizenship. Oswald mailed such a letter that same\r\nday.[A13-486] (The “Historic Diary” is Oswald’s handwritten account of\r\nhis life in Russia.[A13-487] The earlier entries were written after\r\nthe events which they describe; later, in Minsk, he probably kept a\r\ncontemporaneous record of his experiences.[A13-488] The Commission\r\nhas used the diary, which Oswald may have written with future readers\r\nin mind, only as Oswald’s record of his private life and personal\r\nimpressions as he sought to present them and has relied wherever\r\npossible on official documents, correspondence, and the testimony of\r\nwitnesses.)\r\n\r\nThe diary records that when Oswald told Rima Shirokova that he intended\r\nto defect she was “flabbergassted,” but agreeed to help.[A13-489] She\r\nwas “politly sympathetic but uneasy” when he told her that he wanted\r\nto defect because he was “a Communist, ect.”[A13-490] As an Intourist\r\nguide, Rima toured parts of Moscow with Oswald in the next few days.\r\nHis primary concern, however, appeared to be his effort to become a\r\nSoviet citizen, and she also aided him in his dealings with the Soviet\r\nGovernment.[A13-491] He thought that Rima felt sorry for him and tried\r\nto be a friend because he was “someth. new.”[A13-492] On his 20th\r\nbirthday, 2 days after he arrived in Russia, she gave him Dostoevski’s\r\n“The Idiot,”[A13-493] in which she had written: “Dear Lee, Great\r\ncongratulations! Let all your dreams come true! 18.X 1959”[A13-494]\r\n\r\nOn October 19, Oswald was probably interviewed in his hotel room\r\nby a man named Lev Setyayev, who said that he was a reporter for\r\nRadio Moscow seeking statements from American tourists about their\r\nimpressions of Moscow,[A13-495] but who was probably also acting\r\nfor the KGB.[A13-496] Two years later, Oswald told officials at\r\nthe American Embassy that he had made a few routine comments to\r\nSetyayev of no political significance. The interview with Setyayev\r\nmay, however, have been the occasion for an attempt by the KGB, in\r\naccordance with regular practice, to assess Oswald or even to elicit\r\ncompromising statements from him; the interview was apparently never\r\nbroadcast.[A13-497] (As discussed in ch. VI of this report, the\r\nCommission is aware that many of the Soviet officials with whom Oswald\r\ncame into contact were employees of the KGB, the agency which has\r\nprimary jurisdiction for the treatment of defectors.)\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Rima Shirokova told him that the “Pass. and\r\nVisa Dept.” wanted to see him,[A13-498] and on the morning of October\r\n21, he was interviewed by an official concerning his application\r\nfor citizenship. The official offered little information and no\r\nencouragement; he told Oswald only that he would check to see if the\r\nvisa could be extended. Oswald returned to the Hotel Berlin.[A13-499]\r\nThat afternoon, he was notified that his visa had expired and that he\r\nhad to leave Moscow within 2 hours.[A13-500]\r\n\r\nOswald responded to the unfavorable decision by cutting himself\r\nabove his left wrist, in an apparent suicide attempt. Rima Shirokova\r\nfound him unconscious in his hotel room and had him taken to the\r\nBotkinskaya Hospital. His diary states: “Poor Rimmea stays by my side\r\nas interrpator (my Russian is still very bad) far into the night,\r\nI tell her ‘Go home’ (my mood is bad) but she stays, she is ‘my\r\nfriend.’”[A13-501]\r\n\r\nFor 3 days Oswald was confined in the psychiatric ward of the\r\nhospital. He was examined by a psychiatrist, who concluded that he\r\nwas not dangerous to other people and could be transferred to the\r\n“somatic” department. Hospital records containing the results of the\r\nexamination[A13-502] state that Oswald came to Russia in order to\r\napply for citizenship, and that “in order to postpone his departure\r\nhe inflicted the injury upon himself.”[A13-503] They note that Oswald\r\nunderstood some Russian and, presumably based on information which he\r\nprovided, that he had “graduated from a technical high school in radio\r\ntechnology and radio electronics.”[A13-504] The record states: “He\r\nclaims he regrets his action. After recovering he intends to return to\r\nhis homeland.”[A13-505]\r\n\r\nOswald resented being in the psychiatric ward and told Rima Shirokova\r\nthat he wanted a transfer.[A13-506] She visited him at the hospital\r\nfrequently and his diary records that “only at this moment” did\r\nhe “notice [that] she is preety.”[A13-507] Another entry for the\r\nhospital period says: “Afternoon I am visited by Roza Agafonova of\r\nthe hotel tourist office, who askes about my health, very beautiful,\r\nexcelant Eng., very merry and kind, she makes me very glad to be\r\nalive.”[A13-508] These entries reflect an attitude gentler and\r\nfriendlier than his attitude before the suicide attempt, when he seemed\r\nto be coldly concerned only with his status in Russia. Once Oswald\r\nwas out of the psychiatric ward, he found the hospital more pleasant.\r\nThe new ward, which he shared with 11 other patients, was “airy,” and\r\nthe food was good. His only complaint, according to his diary, was\r\nthat an “elderly American” patient was distrustful of him because he\r\nhad not registered at the American Embassy and because he was evasive\r\nabout the reasons for his presence in Moscow and confinement in the\r\nhospital.[A13-509]\r\n\r\nHe was released from the hospital on October 28,[A13-510] and,\r\naccompanied by Rima Shirokova, was driven to the Hotel Berlin in an\r\nIntourist car. After he said goodby to Lyudmila Dmitrieva, head of\r\nthe Intourist office at the Berlin, and to Roza Agafonova, another\r\nIntourist employee at the hotel, he checked out of the Berlin and\r\nregistered at the Metropole,[A13-511] a large hotel under the same\r\nadministration as the Berlin.[A13-512] The Government had undoubtedly\r\ndirected him to make the change. His visa had expired while he was in\r\nthe hospital, and his presence in Russia was technically illegal; he\r\nhad received no word that the decision that he must leave had been\r\nreversed. Later that day, however, Rima told him that the “Pass and\r\nRegistration Office” wished to talk to him about his future.[A13-513]\r\nAccording to the diary, when Oswald appeared at the office he was\r\nasked whether he still wanted to become a Soviet citizen and he\r\nreplied that he did; he provided his Marine Corps discharge papers\r\nfor identification. He was told that he could not expect a decision\r\nsoon, and was dismissed. During this interview, Oswald was apparently\r\nquestioned about the interview which preceded his hospitalization,\r\nwhich led him to conclude that there had been no communication between\r\nthe two sets of officials.[A13-514] That evening he met Rima, on whom\r\nhe vented his frustration at being put off by the authorities.[A13-515]\r\n\r\nOswald ate only once on the following day; he stayed near the\r\ntelephone, fully dressed and ready to leave immediately if he were\r\nsummoned. He remained in his room for 3 days, which seemed to him “like\r\nthree years,”[A13-516] until October 31, when he decided to act. He\r\nmet Rima Shirokova at noon and told her that he was impatient, but did\r\nnot say what he planned to do; she cautioned him to stay in his room\r\n“and eat well.”[A13-517] She left him after a short while and, a few\r\nminutes later, he took a taxi to the American Embassy, where he asked\r\nto see the consul. (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 24, 912, 913, pp. 264,\r\n263, 261.) When the receptionist asked him first to sign the tourist\r\nregister, he laid his passport on the desk and said that he had come\r\nto “dissolve his American citizenship.” Richard E. Snyder, the Second\r\nSecretary and senior consular official,[A13-518] was summoned, and he\r\ninvited Oswald into his office.[A13-519]\r\n\r\nOswald’s meeting with Snyder, at which Snyder’s assistant, John A.\r\nMcVickar, was also present, is more fully discussed in appendix XV to\r\nthe Commission’s report. Oswald declared that he wanted to renounce his\r\nAmerican citizenship; he denounced the United States and praised the\r\nGovernment of the Soviet Union. Over Oswald’s objections, Snyder sought\r\nto learn something of Oswald’s motives and background and to forestall\r\nimmediate action. Oswald told him that he had already offered to tell a\r\nSoviet official what he had learned as a radar operator in the Marines.\r\nThe interview ended when Snyder told Oswald that he could renounce his\r\ncitizenship on the following Monday, 2 days later, if he would appear\r\npersonally to do so. During the interview, Oswald handed to Snyder a\r\nnote[A13-520] which suggests that he had studied and sought to comply\r\nwith section 349 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which provides\r\nfor loss of American citizenship.[A13-521] The note contains paragraphs\r\nwhich read like inartistic attempts to cast off citizenship in three\r\nof the ways specified by the statute. The attempts failed but there is\r\nno reason to doubt that they were sincere. Snyder has testified that\r\nhe believed that Oswald would immediately have formally renounced his\r\ncitizenship had he been permitted to do so.[A13-522]\r\n\r\nThe interview lasted for less than an hour. Oswald returned to his\r\nhotel angry about the delay but “elated” by the “showdown” and sure\r\nthat he would be permitted to remain after his “sign of * * * faith”\r\nin the Russians.[A13-523] Soon after he returned to the hotel, he was\r\napproached by A. I. Goldberg, a reporter for the Associated Press,\r\nwhom the Embassy had told about Oswald’s actions. Oswald refused to\r\nspeak to him.[A13-524] He answered a few questions for two other\r\nreporters, R. J. Korengold and Miss Aline Mosby, but again refused to\r\nbe interviewed.[A13-525] Thereafter, the news services made repeated\r\nunsuccessful attempts to interview him, which he thought was an\r\nindirect form of pressure from the Embassy to return to the United\r\nStates.[A13-526]\r\n\r\nOn the day after Oswald’s meeting with Snyder, his family read in\r\nthe newspapers about his appearance at the Embassy and tried to\r\ncontact him. Mrs. Oswald testified that she was shocked at her son’s\r\ndecision to defect but respected his motives for doing so; later\r\nshe suspected that he had been forcibly removed to Russia.[A13-527]\r\nShe placed a telephone call to him,[A13-528] but he either refused\r\nto speak to her[A13-529] or cut her off very quickly.[A13-530] So\r\ntoo, on November 2, he rejected the Embassy’s efforts to deliver or\r\nread on the telephone a telegram from his brother Robert.[A13-531] A\r\ncall from Robert was either canceled before it was completed or was\r\nrefused.[A13-532] Robert’s telegram, along with a message asking Oswald\r\nto contact him immediately, which Robert had asked the State Department\r\nto deliver,[A13-533] was finally sent to Oswald from the Embassy by\r\nregistered mail.[A13-534]\r\n\r\nA few days later, the Embassy received a letter from Oswald dated\r\nNovember 3 which requested that his citizenship be revoked.[A13-535]\r\nThe letter stated that he had appeared at the Embassy “for the purpose\r\nof signing the formal papers to this effect” and protested against\r\nthe “conduct of the official” who had refused him “this legal right.”\r\nOswald noted that his application for Soviet citizenship was pending\r\nand said that if it were granted he would ask the Soviet Government “to\r\nlodge a formal protest” on his behalf.[A13-536] The Embassy replied on\r\nNovember 9 that Oswald could renounce his citizenship by appearing at\r\nthe Embassy and executing the necessary papers.[A13-537]\r\n\r\nOswald’s diary describes the period from November 2 to November 15,\r\nduring which he continued to isolate himself, as “days of utter\r\nloneliness.”[A13-538] On November 8, he wrote to his brother:\r\n\r\n  Dear Robert\r\n\r\n    Well, what shall we talk about, the weather perhaps? Certainly\r\n    you do not wish me to speak of my decision to remain in the\r\n    Soviet Union and apply for citizenship here, since I’m afraid\r\n    you would not be able to comprehend my my reasons. You really\r\n    dont know anything about me. Do you know for instance that I\r\n    have waited to do this for well over a year, do you know that\r\n    I * * * [phrase in Russian] speak a fair amount of Russian\r\n    which I have been studing for many months.\r\n\r\n    I have been told that I will not _have_ to leave the Soviet\r\n    Union if I do not care to. this than is my decision. I will not\r\n    leave this country, the Soviet Union, under any conditions, I\r\n    will never return to the United States which is a country I\r\n    hate.\r\n\r\n    Someday, perhaps soon, and than again perhaps in a few years,\r\n    I will become a citizen of the Soviet Union, but it is a very\r\n    legal process, _in any event_, I will not have to leave the\r\n    Soviet Union and I will never * * * [word missing].\r\n\r\n    I recived your telegram and was glad to hear from you, only one\r\n    word bothered me, the word “mistake.” I assume you mean that\r\n    I have made a “mistake” it is not for you to tell me that you\r\n    cannot understand my reasons for this very action.\r\n\r\n    I will not speak to anyone from the United States over the\r\n    telephone since it may be taped by the Americans.\r\n\r\n    If you wish to corespond with me you can write to the below\r\n    address, but I really don’t see what we could take about if you\r\n    want to send me money, that I can use, but I do not expect to\r\n    be able to send it back.\r\n\r\n            Lee[A13-539]\r\n\r\nOswald’s statement that he had been told that he could remain in Russia\r\nwas not true. According to his diary, he was not told until later\r\nthat he could remain even temporarily in Russia,[A13-540] and only in\r\nJanuary was he told that he could remain indefinitely.[A13-541] The\r\nEmbassy tried to deliver a typed copy of a telegram from his brother\r\nJohn on November 9; Oswald refused to answer the knock on his door, and\r\nthe message was then sent to him by registered mail.[A13-542]\r\n\r\nToward the end of this waiting period, probably on November 13, Aline\r\nMosby succeeded in interviewing Oswald.[A13-543] A reporter for United\r\nPress International, she had called him on the telephone and was told\r\nto come right over, Oswald’s explanation being that he thought she\r\nmight “understand and be friendly” because she was a woman.[A13-544]\r\nShe was the first person who was not a Soviet citizen to whom he\r\ngranted an interview since his meeting with Snyder at the Embassy on\r\nOctober 31. Miss Mosby found him polite but stiff; she said that he\r\nseemed full of confidence, often showing a “small smile, more like a\r\nsmirk,” and that he talked almost “non-stop.” Oswald said to her that\r\nhe had been told that he could remain in the Soviet Union and that job\r\npossibilities were being explored; they thought it probably would be\r\nbest, he said, to continue his education. He admitted that his Russian\r\nwas bad but was confident that it would improve rapidly. He based his\r\ndislike for the United States on his observations of racial prejudice\r\nand the contrast between “the luxuries of Park Avenue and workers’\r\nlives on the East Side,” and mentioned his mother’s poverty; he said\r\nthat if he had remained in the United States he too would have become\r\neither a capitalist or a worker. “One way or another,” he said, “I’d\r\nlose in the United States. In my own mind, even if I’d be exploiting\r\nother workers. That’s why I chose Marxist ideology.”\r\n\r\nOswald told his interviewer that he had been interested in Communist\r\ntheory since he was 15, when “an old lady” in New York handed him “a\r\npamphlet about saving the Rosenbergs.” But when Mosby asked if he\r\nwere a member of the Communist Party he said that he had never met a\r\nCommunist and that he “might have seen” one only once, when he saw\r\nthat “old lady.” He told her that while he was in the Marine Corps\r\nhe had seen American imperialism in action, and had saved $1,500 in\r\nsecret preparation for his defection to Russia. His only apparent\r\nregrets concerned his family: his mother, whom he had not told of his\r\nplans, and his brother, who might lose his job as a result of the\r\npublicity.[A13-545]\r\n\r\nThe interview lasted for about 2 hours. According to Oswald’s own\r\naccount, he exacted a promise from Miss Mosby that she would show\r\nhim the story before publication but she broke the promise; he found\r\nthe published story to contain distortions of his words.[A13-546]\r\nMiss Mosby’s notes indicate that he called her to complain of the\r\ndistortions, saying in particular that his family had not been\r\n“poverty-stricken” and that his defection was not prompted by personal\r\nhardship but that was “a matter only of ideology.”[A13-547]\r\n\r\nAccording to the diary, Oswald was told in mid-November that he could\r\nremain temporarily in Russia “until some solution was found with what\r\nto do” with him.[A13-548] Armed with this “comforting news,”[A13-549]\r\nhe granted a second interview, again to a woman, on November\r\n16.[A13-550] Miss Priscilla Johnson of the North American Newspaper\r\nAlliance knocked on the door of his room at the Metropole, and Oswald\r\nagreed to come to her room at the hotel that evening. This interview\r\nlasted about 5 hours, from 9 p.m. until about 2 in the morning. During\r\nthe interview he frequently mentioned the fact that he would be able\r\nto remain in Russia, which gave him great pleasure, but he also showed\r\ndisappointment about the difficulties standing in the way of his\r\nrequest for Soviet citizenship. He repeated most of the information\r\nhe had given Aline Mosby and again denied having been a member of the\r\nCommunist Party or even ever having seen a Communist in the United\r\nStates. When Miss Johnson asked him to specify some of the socialist\r\nwriters whose works he had read during the past 5 years, he could name\r\nonly Marx and Engels; the only title he could recall was “Das Kapital.”\r\nThey talked for a long while about Communist economic theory, which\r\nMiss Johnson thought was “his language”; she became convinced that his\r\nknowledge of the subject was very superficial.[A13-551] He commented\r\nthat the Russians treated his defection as a “legal formality,” neither\r\nencouraging nor discouraging it.[A13-552] When she suggested that if\r\nhe really wished to renounce his American citizenship he could do so\r\nby returning to the Embassy, he said that he would “never set foot\r\nin the Embassy again,” since he was sure that he would be given the\r\n“same run-around” as before. He seemed to Miss Johnson to be avoiding\r\neffective renunciation, consciously or unconsciously, in order to\r\npreserve his right to reenter the United States.[A13-553]\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the year, Oswald seldom left his hotel room where he\r\nhad arranged to take his meals, except perhaps for a few trips to\r\nmuseums. He spent most of his time studying Russian, “8 hours a day”\r\nhis diary records. The routine was broken only by another interview at\r\nthe passport office; occasional visits from Rima Shirokova; lessons in\r\nRussian from her and other Intourist guides; and a New Year’s visit\r\nfrom Roza Agafonova, who gave him a small “Boratin” clown as a New\r\nYear’s present.[A13-554] He replied to a letter from Robert in a letter\r\nquoted at length in chapter VII of this report, which contains his most\r\nbitter statements against the United States.[A13-555] Robert received\r\na third letter on December 17, in which Oswald said that he would\r\nnot write again and did not wish Robert to write to him. The letter\r\nconcluded:\r\n\r\n    I am starting a new life and I do not wish to have anything to\r\n    do with the old life.\r\n\r\n    I hope you and your family will always be in good health.\r\n\r\n            Lee[A13-556]\r\n\r\nHis mother mailed him a personal check for $20 dated December 18. It\r\nwas returned to her on January 5 with the notation that he could not\r\n“use this check, of course”; he asked her to send him $20 in cash and\r\nadded that he had little money and needed “the rest,” presumably a\r\nreference to the $100 he had given her in September. Mrs. Oswald later\r\nsent him a money order for about $25.[A13-557]\r\n\r\nOn January 4, Oswald was summoned to the Soviet Passport Office and\r\ngiven Identity Document for Stateless Persons No. 311479.[A13-558] He\r\nwas told that he was being sent to Minsk,[A13-559] an industrial city\r\nlocated about 450 miles southwest of Moscow and with a population in\r\n1959 of about 510,000.[A13-560] His disappointment that he had not been\r\ngranted Soviet citizenship was balanced by relief that the uncertainty\r\nwas ended; he told Rima Shirokova that he was happy.[A13-561] On the\r\nfollowing day, he went to a Government agency which the Russians call\r\nthe “Red Cross”; it gave him 5,000 rubles (about 500 new rubles, or\r\n$500 at the official exchange rate).[A13-562] He used 2,200 rubles to\r\npay his hotel bill and 150 rubles to purchase a railroad ticket to\r\nMinsk.[A13-563]\r\n\r\nOswald arrived in Minsk on January 7. He was met at the station by two\r\n“Red Cross” workers who took him to the Hotel Minsk. Two Intourist\r\nemployees, both of whom spoke excellent English, were waiting for\r\nhim.[A13-564] One of them, a young woman named Roza Kuznetsova, became\r\nhis close friend and attended his 21st birthday party in October\r\n1960.[A13-565] (See Commission Exhibit No. 2609, p. 271.) On the\r\nfollowing day, Oswald met the “Mayor,” who welcomed him to Minsk,\r\npromised him a rent-free apartment, and warned him against “uncultured\r\npersons” who sometimes insulted foreigners.[A13-566]\r\n\r\nOswald reported for work at the Belorussian Radio and Television\r\nFactory on January 13.[A13-567] Two days earlier he had visited the\r\nfactory and met Alexander Ziger, a Polish Jew who had emigrated to\r\nArgentina in 1938 and went to Russia in 1955. Ziger was a department\r\nhead at the factory; he spoke English, and he and his family became\r\ngood friends of Oswald and corresponded with him after his return\r\nto the United States.[A13-568] The factory, a major producer of\r\nelectronic parts and systems, employed about 5,000 persons.[A13-569]\r\nOswald’s union card described him as a “metal worker”;[A13-570] Marina\r\ntestified that he fashioned parts on a lathe.[A13-571] As Oswald later\r\ndescribed it, the shop in which he worked, called the “experimental\r\nshop,”[A13-572] employed 58 workers and 5 foremen. It was located in\r\nthe middle part of the factory area in a 2-story building made of\r\nred brick. The workday began at 8 o’clock sharp. Work was assigned\r\naccording to “pay levels,” which were numbered from one to five plus a\r\ntop “master” level. A worker could ask to be tested for a higher level\r\nat any time.[A13-573]\r\n\r\nOswald had hoped to continue his education in Russia, and was\r\ndisappointed by his assignment to a factory.[A13-574] His salary varied\r\nfrom 700 to perhaps as high as 900 rubles per month ($70-$90).[A13-575]\r\nAlthough high compared with the salaries of certain professional groups\r\nin Russia, which in some areas have not grown proportionately with\r\nthe wages of factory workers,[A13-576] his salary was normal for his\r\ntype of work.[A13-577] It was supplemented, however, by 700 rubles\r\nper month, which he received from the “Red Cross,” and, according\r\nto Oswald, his total income was about equal to that of the director\r\nof the factory.[A13-578] In August he applied for membership in the\r\nunion;[A13-579] he became a dues-paying member in September.[A13-580]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly more noteworthy to most Russians than his extra income\r\nwas the attractive apartment which Oswald was given in March 1959. It\r\nwas a small flat with a balcony overlooking the river,[A13-581] for\r\nwhich he paid only 60 rubles a month.[A13-582] (See Commission Exhibit\r\nNo. 2606, p. 271.) Oswald describes it in his diary as “a Russian\r\ndream.”[A13-583] Had Oswald been a Russian worker, he would probably\r\nhave had to wait for several years for a comparable apartment, and\r\nwould have been given one even then only if he had a family.[A13-584]\r\nThe “Red Cross” subsidy and the apartment were typical of the favorable\r\ntreatment which the Soviet Union has given defectors.[A13-585]\r\n\r\nOswald’s diary records that he enjoyed his first months in Minsk.\r\nHis work at the factory was easy and his coworkers were friendly and\r\ncurious about life in the United States; he declined an invitation\r\nto speak at a mass meeting. He took Roza Kuznetsova, his interpreter\r\nand language teacher,[A13-586] to the theater, a movie, or an opera\r\nalmost every night, until he moved into his apartment and temporarily\r\nlost contact with her. He wrote in his diary, “I’m living big and am\r\nvery satisfied.”[A13-587] In March or April, he met Pavel Golovachev,\r\na co-worker at the factory, whom Oswald described as intelligent and\r\nfriendly and an excellent radio technician. (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n2609, p. 271.) Oswald helped Golovachev with English.[A13-588] They\r\nbecame friends,[A13-589] and corresponded after Oswald returned to the\r\nUnited States until at least as late as September 1963.[A13-590]\r\n\r\nThe spring and summer passed easily and uneventfully. There were\r\npicnics and drives in the country, which Oswald described as “green\r\nbeauty.”[A13-591] On June 18, he obtained a hunting license and soon\r\nafterward purchased a 16-gage single-barrel shotgun. His hunting\r\nlicense identifies him as “Aleksy Harvey Oswald.” (He was called\r\n“Alec” by his Russian friends, because “Lee” sounded foreign to them\r\nand was difficult for them to pronounce.)[A13-592] He joined a local\r\nchapter of the Belorussian Society of Hunters and Fishermen, a hunting\r\nclub sponsored by his factory, and hunted for small game in the farm\r\nregions around Minsk about half a dozen times in the summer and fall.\r\nThe hunters spent the night in small villages and often left their bag\r\nwith the villagers; Oswald described the peasant life which he saw as\r\ncrude and poor.[A13-593] Sometime in June, he met Ella German, a worker\r\nat the factory, of whom he later said he “perhaps fell in love with\r\nher the first minute” he saw her.[A13-594] (See Commission Exhibit No.\r\n2609, p. 271.)\r\n\r\nAt the same time, however, the first signs of disillusionment with\r\nhis Russian life appeared. He noted in his diary that he felt “uneasy\r\ninside” after a friend took him aside at a party and advised him to\r\nreturn to the United States.[A13-595] Another entry compared life in\r\nMinsk with military life:\r\n\r\n    I have become habituatated to a small cafe which is where I\r\n    dine in the evening. The food is generaly poor and always\r\n    eactly the same, menue in any cafe, at any point in the city.\r\n    The food is cheap and I don’t really care about quiality after\r\n    three years in the U.S.M.C.[A13-596]\r\n\r\nIn an entry for August-September, he wrote that he was becoming\r\n“increasingly concious of just what sort of a sociaty” he lived\r\nin.[A13-597]\r\n\r\nHe spent New Year’s Day at the home of Ella German and her family. They\r\nate and drank in a friendly atmosphere, and he was “drunk and happy”\r\nwhen he returned home. During the walk back to his apartment he decided\r\nto ask Ella to marry him. On the following night, after he had brought\r\nher home from the movies, he proposed on her doorstep. She rejected\r\nhim, saying that she did not love him and that she was afraid to marry\r\nan American. She said that the Polish intervention in the 1920’s had\r\nled to the arrest of all people in the Soviet Union of Polish origin\r\nand she feared that something similar might happen to Americans some\r\nday. Oswald was “too stunned to think,” and concluded that she had gone\r\nout with him only because she was envied by the other girls for having\r\nan American as an escort.[A13-598] But in one of the entries in the\r\ndiary he appears to have attributed her failure to love him to “a state\r\nof fear which was always in the Soviet Union.”[A13-599] His affection\r\nfor Ella German apparently continued for some time;[A13-600] he had his\r\nlast formal date with her in February and remained on friendly terms\r\nwith her as long as he was in Russia.[A13-601]\r\n\r\nAfter he returned to the United States, Oswald often commented\r\non Russian life. He discussed the Soviet systems of public\r\neducation[A13-602] and medical care.[A13-603] He observed to\r\none acquaintance that everyone in Russia was trained to do\r\nsomething,[A13-604] and discussed with another the system of regular\r\nwage and salary increases.[A13-605] His most frequent criticisms\r\nconcerned the contrast between the lives of ordinary workers and the\r\nlives of Communist Party members. He told an acquaintance in Dallas\r\nthat the working class in the Soviet Union made just about enough\r\nto buy clothing and food and that only party members could afford\r\nluxuries.[A13-606] On another occasion, he remarked that if he had had\r\nas much money as some of the “managers,” he could have visited the\r\nBlack Sea resorts.[A13-607] He complained about the lack of freedom in\r\nRussia;[A13-608] the lack of opportunity to travel;[A13-609] inadequate\r\nhousing;[A13-610] and the chronic scarcity of food products.[A13-611]\r\nTo one acquaintance, he observed that the party members were all\r\n“opportunists,” who “shouted the loudest and made the most noise,” but\r\nwho were interested only in their own welfare.[A13-612]\r\n\r\nHe expressed similar views in a manuscript which he worked on in\r\nRussia[A13-613] and probably intended to publish; soon after he\r\nreturned to the United States, he hired a stenographer to prepare a\r\ntyped draft from his notes.[A13-614] Oswald described the manuscript,\r\nwhich amounted to 50 typed pages, as “a look into the lives of\r\nwork-a-day average Russians.”[A13-615]\r\n\r\nThe manuscript describes the factory in which Oswald worked and\r\nsuggests that political considerations of which Oswald disapproved\r\ndominated its operation. He attributed the lack of unemployment to the\r\nshortage of labor-saving machinery and the heavy load of bureaucracy,\r\nwhich kept “tons of paper work” flowing in and out of the factory and\r\nrequired a high foreman-worker ratio.[A13-616] In addition, he wrote,\r\nthere was “a small army of examiners, committees, and supply checkers\r\nand the quality-control board.”[A13-617]\r\n\r\nHe described life in Russia, including life at the factory, as centered\r\naround the “Kollective.” The head of the Kollective in his shop,\r\nComrade Lebizen, saw to it that everyone maintained shop discipline,\r\nattended party meetings, and received all the new propaganda as it\r\ncame out. He hung the walls of the shop with signs and slogans of the\r\nCommunist Party. Meetings of the Kollective were “so numerous as to be\r\nstaggering.” In a single month, there were scheduled one meeting of\r\nthe professional union, four political information meetings, two young\r\nCommunist meetings, one meeting of the production committee to discuss\r\nways of improving work, two Communist Party meetings, four meetings of\r\nthe “School of Communist Labor,” and one sports meeting. All but one\r\nof them were compulsory for Communist Party members and all but three\r\nwere compulsory for everyone.[A13-618] (Marina Oswald testified that\r\nher husband did not attend the courses in Marxism and Leninism given\r\nin the factory for party members and those who wished to become party\r\nmembers.)[A13-619] They were scheduled so as not to interfere with\r\nwork, and lasted anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours. Oswald said that\r\nno one liked the meetings, which were accepted “philosophically”; at\r\nthe political meetings especially, everyone paid strict attention, and\r\nparty members were posted in the audience to watch for the slightest\r\nsign that anyone’s attention might relax, even for a moment.[A13-620]\r\n\r\nOswald wrote that the “spontaneous” demonstrations on Soviet holidays\r\nor for distinguished visitors were almost as well organized as the\r\nKollectivist meetings at the factory.[A13-621] He noted that elections\r\nwere supervised to ensure that everyone voted, and that they voted\r\nfor the candidates of the Communist Party. The manuscript touches\r\non other aspects of Soviet life--as the housing shortage and the\r\ncorruption which it evoked, the “rest-homes” where workers had their\r\nvacations, television and the omni-present radio, and Russian reading\r\nhabits.[A13-622] This writing also may include only what Oswald thought\r\nmight be acceptable.\r\n\r\nOn January 4, 1961, I year after he had been issued his “stateless”\r\nresidence permit, Oswald was summoned to the passport office in Minsk\r\nand asked if he still wanted to become a Soviet citizen. He replied\r\nthat he did not, but asked that his residence permit be extended for\r\nanother year.[A13-623] The entry in his diary for January 4-31 reads:\r\n“I am stating to reconsider my disire about staying. The work is drab.\r\nThe money I get has nowhere to be spent. No nightclubs or bowling\r\nallys, no places of recreation acept the trade union dances. I have had\r\nenough.”[A13-624]\r\n\r\nThe American Embassy in Moscow had not heard from Oswald after it\r\nreceived his letter of November 3, 1959.[A13-625] On February 13,\r\n1961, it received an undated letter from him which had been mailed in\r\nMinsk about a week earlier. He asked for the return of his passport\r\nand stated that he wanted to return to the United States if he could\r\n“come to some agreement [with the American Government] concerning the\r\ndropping of any legal proceedings” against him. He noted that he had\r\nnot become a Soviet citizen and was living in Russia with “nonpermanent\r\ntype papers for a foreigner,” and said that he did not appear\r\npersonally because he could not leave Minsk without permission. The\r\nletter concluded: “I hope that in recalling the responsibility I have\r\nto America that you remember yours in doing everything you can to help\r\nme, since I am an American citizen.”[A13-626] In this letter, Oswald\r\nreferred to a previous letter which he said had gone unanswered; there\r\nis evidence that such a letter was never sent.[A13-627]\r\n\r\nThe Second Secretary, Richard Snyder, answered on February 28 that\r\nOswald would have to appear at the Embassy personally to discuss\r\nhis return to the United States.[A13-628] In the meantime, Oswald’s\r\nmother, who in January had inquired at the Department of State about\r\nhis whereabouts,[A13-629] had been notified of his letter.[A13-630]\r\nA second letter from Oswald, posted on March 5, reached the Embassy\r\non March 20; it reiterated that he was unable to leave Minsk without\r\npermission and asked that “preliminary inquiries * * * be put in the\r\nform of a questionnaire” and sent to him.[A13-631] His diary entry\r\nfor this period records his “state of expectation about going back to\r\nthe U.S.,” and adds that a friend had approved his plans but warned\r\nhim not to discuss them with others.[A13-632] (The Soviet authorities\r\nhad undoubtedly intercepted and read the correspondence between\r\nOswald and the Embassy and knew of his plans.[A13-633] Soon after the\r\ncorrespondence began, his monthly payments from the “Red Cross” were\r\ncut off.)[A13-634] Having informed Washington,[A13-635] the Embassy\r\nwrote to Oswald on March 24, stating again that he would have to\r\ncome to Moscow.[A13-636] Later, the Department of State decided that\r\nOswald’s passport should be returned to him only if he appeared at\r\nthe Embassy for it and the Embassy was satisfied, after exploring the\r\nmatter with him, that he had not renounced his citizenship.[A13-637]\r\n\r\nSometime in the second week of March, Miss Katherine Mallory, who\r\nwas on tour in Minsk with the University of Michigan symphonic band,\r\nfound herself surrounded by curious Russian citizens. A young man who\r\nidentified himself as a Texan and former marine stepped out of the\r\ncrowd and asked if she needed an interpreter; he interpreted for her\r\nfor the next 15 or 20 minutes. Later he told her that he despised the\r\nUnited States and hoped to stay in Minsk for the rest of his life. Miss\r\nMallory is unable to swear that her interpreter was Oswald, but is\r\npersonally convinced that it was he.[A13-638]\r\n\r\nA few days later, probably on March 17, Oswald attended a trade union\r\ndance with a friend, Erik Titovyets, at the Palace of Culture for\r\nProfessional Workers in Minsk.[A13-639] The dance followed a lecture\r\nby a Russian woman who had recently returned from a trip to the United\r\nStates.[A13-640] Marina Nikolayevna Prusakova arrived too late to\r\nhear the lecture[A13-641] but was at the dance. Oswald noticed her\r\nand asked Yuriy Merezhinskiy, the son of the lecturer and a friend\r\nof both Oswald and Marina, to introduce him to her. Oswald asked her\r\nto dance. According to the diary, they liked each other immediately\r\nand he obtained her telephone number before she left.[A13-642] Marina\r\ntestified that she told Oswald that she might see him at another\r\ndance, but did not give him her telephone number.[A13-643] Oswald was\r\nsmitten.[A13-644]\r\n\r\nMarina Prusakova was 19 years old when she met Oswald. (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 1395, p. 270.) She was born on July 17,\r\n1941, at Severodvinsk (formerly Molotovsk), Arkhangel Oblast’,\r\nRussia.[A13-645] A few years later, her mother, Klavdiya Vasilievna\r\nPrusakova, married Aleksandr Ivanovich Medvedev, who became the\r\nonly father Marina knew.[A13-646] While she was still a young girl,\r\nMarina went to Arkhangel’sk, Arkhangel Oblast’, to live with her\r\nmaternal grandparents, Tatyana Yakovlevna Prusakova and Vasiliy\r\nPrusakov. Her grandfather died when Marina was about 4 years old;\r\nshe continued to live with her grandmother for some time.[A13-647]\r\nWhen she was not more than 7, she moved to Zguritva, Moldavian SSR\r\n(formerly called Bessarabia) to live with her mother and stepfather,\r\nwho was an electrical worker.[A13-648] In 1952, the family moved to\r\nLeningrad,[A13-649] where her stepfather obtained a job in a power\r\nstation.[A13-650] Marina testified that neither he nor her mother was a\r\nmember of the Communist Party.[A13-651]\r\n\r\nIn Leningrad, Marina attended the Three Hundred and Seventy-Fourth\r\nWomen’s School. After she had completed the seventh grade at the school\r\nin 1955,[A13-652] she entered the Pharmacy Teknikum for special\r\ntraining, which she had requested on the ground that her mother was ill\r\nand Marina might need to have a specialty in order to support herself.\r\nWhile she was at the Teknikum, she joined the Trade Union for Medical\r\nWorkers[A13-653] and, in her last year there, worked part time in the\r\nCentral Pharmacy in Leningrad. She graduated from the Teknikum with a\r\ndiploma in pharmacy in June 1959.\r\n\r\nMarina’s mother had died in 1957, during Marina’s second year at the\r\nTeknikum; she continued to live with her stepfather, but had little\r\ncontact with him. She testified that she did not get along with her\r\nstepfather, whom she displeased by her fresh conduct; she said that\r\nshe was not easily disciplined[A13-654] and was a source of concern to\r\nhim.[A13-655] Because of the friction between them, Marina regarded her\r\nchildhood as an unhappy one.\r\n\r\nAfter her graduation, Marina was assigned to a job preparing and\r\npacking orders in a pharmaceutical warehouse in Leningrad; as a new\r\nemployee she had the right to leave this job within 3 days after the\r\nassignment,[A13-656] and she did so after the first day. She took no\r\njob for the next 2 months, at the end of which she went to live in\r\nMinsk with an aunt and uncle, the Prusakovs, who had no children. She\r\nhad known them since she was a child and there was a mutual affection\r\nbetween her and them.[A13-657] Her uncle, a member of the Communist\r\nParty,[A13-658] was assigned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and\r\nheaded the local bureau concerned with lumber. The Prusakovs had one of\r\nthe best apartments in a building reserved for MVD employees.[A13-659]\r\n\r\nMarina was 18 when she arrived in Minsk. She had had boyfriends in\r\nLeningrad but was not interested in marriage. In October 1960 she\r\nstarted work in the drug section of the Third Clinical Hospital where\r\nshe earned about 450 rubles per month;[A13-660] at about the same\r\ntime she became a member of the local Komsomol, the Communist youth\r\norganization.[A13-661] Her friends were mostly students, whose social\r\nlife consisted of meeting in cafes to sip coffee, read newspapers,\r\ngossip, and carry on discussions. The group of friends “ran together,”\r\nand Marina did not attach herself to a particular boyfriend. She\r\nenjoyed this life, which she had been leading for about 7 months\r\nwhen she met Oswald at the dance at the Palace of Culture in March\r\n1961.[A13-662]\r\n\r\nWhen Marina met Oswald, she thought he was from one of the\r\nRussian-speaking Baltic countries because he spoke with an accent;\r\nlater that same evening she learned that he was an American.[A13-663]\r\nShe met him again at another dance a week later.[A13-664] They danced\r\ntogether most of the evening, at the end of which he walked home with\r\nher. They arranged to meet again the following week.[A13-665] Before\r\nthe scheduled time, Oswald called to say that he was in the hospital\r\nand that Marina should visit him there.[A13-666] Medical records\r\nfurnished to the Commission by the Russian Government show that\r\nOswald was admitted to the Clinical Hospital--Ear, Nose, and Throat\r\nDivision, on Thursday, March 30, 1961.[A13-667] Marina visited him\r\noften,[A13-668] taking advantage of her uniform to visit him outside\r\nregular visiting hours, which were only on Sunday.[A13-669] On Easter\r\nSunday, the first Sunday after his admission to the hospital, she\r\nbrought him an Easter egg.[A13-670] On a subsequent visit, he asked her\r\nto be his fiancee, and she agreed to consider it.[A13-671] He left the\r\nhospital on April 11.[A13-672]\r\n\r\nDuring these visits, Marina apparently discussed with Oswald his\r\nreasons for coming to Russia and his current status. According to\r\nher later account, he told her that he had surrendered his American\r\ndocuments to the Embassy in Moscow and had told American officials\r\nthat he did not intend to return to the United States. He did not say\r\ndefinitely that he was no longer an American citizen, but said in\r\nanswer to a question about his citizenship that he could not return to\r\nthe United States.[A13-673]\r\n\r\nOswald visited Marina regularly at her aunt and uncle’s apartment;\r\nthey were apparently not disturbed by the fact that he was an American\r\nand did not disapprove of her seeing him. He continued to ask her\r\nto marry him and, according to her recollection, she accepted his\r\nproposal on April 20;[A13-674] Oswald’s diary puts the date 5 days\r\nearlier.[A13-675] Marina testified that she believed that Oswald could\r\nnot return to the United States when she agreed to marry him, and that\r\nshe had not married him in hope of going to the United States.[A13-676]\r\n\r\nAfter filing notice of their intent to marry at the registrar,\r\nobtaining the special consent necessary for an alien to marry a\r\ncitizen, and waiting the usual 10 days, they were married on April\r\n30.[A13-677] The diary entry for the wedding day reads:\r\n\r\n    two of Marinas girl friends act as bridesmaids. We are married.\r\n    At her aunts home we have a dinner reception for about 20\r\n    friends and neboribos who wish us happiness (in spite of\r\n    my origin and accept [accent?] which was in general rather\r\n    disquiting to any Russian since for. are very rare in the\r\n    soviet Union even tourist.

We lived near each\r\n    other, at midnight we were home.[A13-678]\r\n\r\nThey both took 3 days off from their jobs, which they spent in\r\nMinsk.[A13-679]\r\n\r\nOswald wrote in his diary for May 1, 1 day after the wedding: “In spite\r\nof fact I married Marina to hurt Ella I found myself in love with\r\nMarina.”[A13-680] The next entry, marked simply “May,” reads in part:\r\n\r\n    The trasistion of changing full love from Ella to Marina was\r\n    very painfull esp. as I saw Ella almost every day at the\r\n    factory but as the days & weeks went by I adjusted more and\r\n    more [to] my wife mentaly * * * She is maddly in love with me\r\n    from the very start. Boat rides on Lake Minsk walks through\r\n    the parks evening at home or at Aunt Valia’s place mark\r\n    May.”[A13-681]\r\n\r\nAnd in June: “A continuence of May, except that; we draw closer and\r\ncloser, and I think very little now of Ella.”[A13-682]\r\n\r\nSometime within the first month or two after they were married Oswald\r\ntold his wife that he was anxious to return to the United States. The\r\ndiary says that he told her “in the last days” of June and that she was\r\n“slightly startled” but encouraged him to do as he wished.[A13-683]\r\nMarina’s recollection is that she learned of his plan between May\r\nand July. Embassy records show that Oswald notified the Embassy in\r\na letter received on May 25 that he was married and his wife would\r\nseek to accompany him to the United States.[A13-684] At about this\r\ntime, the Oswalds began to make inquiries in Soviet offices about exit\r\nvisas.[A13-685]\r\n\r\nWhile these preparations were being made, the Oswalds apparently\r\nenjoyed their new life.[A13-686] They ate most of their meals in cafes\r\nor at restaurants where they worked.[A13-687] For amusement, they\r\nwent boating, attended the opera, concerts, the circus, and films;\r\noccasionally, they gathered with a group of friends for a cooperative\r\nmeal at someone’s apartment.[A13-688] His Russian improved, but he\r\nretained an accent and never learned to speak grammatically or to write\r\nwell.[A13-689] He read the English language edition of the Daily Worker\r\nand books, also in English, on Marxism and Leninism; he also read some\r\nRussian newspapers.[A13-690]\r\n\r\nBefore he married Marina (and presumably before February, when he\r\nhad begun his efforts to return to the United States) Oswald had\r\napplied for admission to the Patrice Lumumba Friendship University in\r\nMoscow. He received a letter dated May 3 apologizing for the delay in\r\nresponding to his application and turning it down on the ground that\r\nthe university had been established exclusively for students from the\r\nunderdeveloped countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.[A13-691]\r\nOswald expressed his disappointment at having been turned down to\r\nMarina.[A13-692]\r\n\r\nOswald reopened his correspondence with his family on May 5, with\r\na friendly letter to his brother Robert. He said nothing about his\r\ncontacts with the American Embassy, but mentioned that he had married,\r\nand that he had a job as a “metal-smith” and was living well. He asked\r\nhis brother for their mother’s address, and encouraged him to come to\r\nMinsk for a visit.[A13-693] Robert answered the letter quickly. On May\r\n31, Oswald wrote again and expressed his pleasure at having heard from\r\nRobert after so long. Apparently in response to an offer to send him\r\nwhatever he needed, Oswald wrote that he needed nothing and thanked\r\nRobert for the thought; he suggested, however, that Marina might like\r\na small wedding present. At the end of the letter he said that he did\r\nnot know whether he would ever return to the United States; he said\r\nthat before he could return he would have to obtain the permission of\r\nthe Soviet Union for him and Marina to leave and insure that no charges\r\nwould be lodged against him in the United States. In this letter, he\r\nmentioned that he was in touch with the Embassy in Moscow.[A13-694] At\r\nabout this time, Oswald wrote also to his mother.[A13-695]\r\n\r\nOn May 25, the Embassy received a letter mailed in Minsk about 10\r\ndays before, in which Oswald asked for assurances that he would not\r\nbe prosecuted if he returned to the United States, and informed\r\nthe Embassy that he had married a Russian woman who would want to\r\naccompany him.[A13-696] The Embassy communicated this development\r\nto Washington[A13-697] and did not answer Oswald immediately. In\r\naddition, he had had no word since March concerning the return of his\r\npassport. Impatient for action,[A13-698] he appeared without warning\r\nat the Embassy on July 8; it was a Saturday and the offices were\r\nclosed.[A13-699] He used the house telephone to reach Snyder, who came\r\nto the office, talked with him briefly, and suggested that he return on\r\nthe following Monday.[A13-700] Oswald called Marina and asked her to\r\njoin him in Moscow. She arrived on Sunday, July 9,[A13-701] and they\r\ntook a room at the Hotel Berlin,[A13-702] where he had stayed when he\r\nfirst arrived in Russia.\r\n\r\nOswald returned to the Embassy on Monday. Marina waited outside during\r\nhis interview with Snyder,[A13-703] who asked to see Oswald’s Soviet\r\npapers and questioned him closely about his life in Russia and possible\r\nexpatriating acts. Oswald stated that he was not a citizen of the\r\nSoviet Union and had never formally applied for citizenship, that he\r\nhad never taken an oath of allegiance to the Soviet Union, and that\r\nhe was not a member of the factory trade union organization. He said\r\nthat he had never given Soviet officials any confidential information\r\nthat he had learned in the Marines, had never been asked to give such\r\ninformation, and “doubted” that he would have done so had he been\r\nasked.[A13-704] Some of Oswald’s statements during this interview were\r\nundoubtedly false. He had almost certainly applied for citizenship in\r\nthe Soviet Union[A13-705] and, at least for a time, been disappointed\r\nwhen it was denied.[A13-706] He possessed a membership card in the\r\nunion organization.[A13-707] In addition, his assertion to Snyder that\r\nhe had never been questioned by Soviet authorities concerning his life\r\nin the United States is simply unbelievable.\r\n\r\nOswald showed anxiety, already displayed in his letters, that he might\r\nbe prosecuted and imprisoned if he returned to the United States.\r\nSnyder told him informally that he did not know any grounds on which\r\nhe would be prosecuted but that he could give no assurances in this\r\nregard.[A13-708] Snyder testified that Oswald seemed to have matured\r\nwhile he was in Russia and did not show the bravado and arrogance which\r\ncharacterized his first contacts with the Embassy. Oswald told him that\r\nhe had “learned a hard lesson the hard way” and had acquired a new\r\nappreciation of the United States and the meaning of freedom.[A13-709]\r\n\r\nSince Oswald’s passport would expire on September 10, 1961,[A13-710]\r\nbefore which date he probably would not be able to obtain Russian exit\r\npapers, he filled out an application for its renewal.[A13-711] On a\r\nquestionnaire attached to the application,[A13-712] he reiterated\r\nhis oral statements that he had obtained only a residence permit in\r\nthe Soviet Union and was still an American national. On the basis of\r\nOswald’s written and oral statements, Snyder concluded that he had not\r\nexpatriated himself and returned his passport, stamped valid only for\r\ndirect travel to the United States,[A13-713] to him. Accompanied by\r\nhis wife,[A13-714] Oswald came to the Embassy again on the following\r\nday,[A13-715] to initiate procedures for her admission to the United\r\nStates as an immigrant; they had a routine interview with McVickar,\r\nSnyder’s assistant.[A13-716] Three days later, they returned to\r\nMinsk.[A13-717]\r\n\r\nOn the same day, Oswald wrote to his brother. He told Robert that he\r\nhad his passport again and that he and Marina were doing everything\r\npossible to leave the Soviet Union. Apparently referring to his initial\r\nreappearance at the Embassy in quest of his passport, he wrote: “I\r\ncould write a book about how many feeling have come and gone since that\r\nday.” The letter closed with an affectionate greeting to his brother\r\nand his family.[A13-718] The letter’s tone of firm purpose to return to\r\nthe United States in the face of heavy odds reflected Oswald’s attitude\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they returned to Minsk, the Oswalds began to work with local\r\nauthorities for permission to leave the country.[A13-719] His diary\r\nentry for July 16 through August 20 reads,\r\n\r\n    We have found out which blanks and certificates are nessceary\r\n    to apply for a exit visa. They number about 20 papers; birth\r\n    certificates, affidavit, photos, ect. On Aug 20th we give\r\n    the papers out they say it will be 3½ months before we know\r\n    wheather they let us go or not. In the meantime Marina has had\r\n    to stade 4 differant meeting at the place of work held by her\r\n    boss’s at the direction of “someone” by phone. The Young Comm.\r\n    leauge headquttes also called about her and she had to go see\r\n    them for 1½ hours. The purpose (expressed) is to disuade her\r\n    from going to the U.S.A. Net effect: Make her more stubborn\r\n    about wanting to go. Marina is pregnet. We only hope that the\r\n    visas come through soon.[A13-720]\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated July 15, he reported their efforts to the Embassy,\r\nand said that he would keep it informed “as to the overall picture.”\r\nThe letter mentioned that Marina was having difficulties at work\r\nbecause of her decision to leave but added that such “tactics” were\r\n“quite useless” and that Marina had “stood up well, without getting\r\ninto trouble.”[A13-721] For August 21 through September 1, the diary\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n    I make repeated trips to the passport & visa office, also\r\n    to Ministry of For. Affairs in Minsk, also Min. of Internal\r\n    Affairs, all of which have a say in the granting of a visa. I\r\n    extrackted promises of quick attention to us.[A13-722]\r\n\r\nFor September through October 18, “No word from Min. (‘They’ll call\r\nus.’).”[A13-723]\r\n\r\nMarina testified that when the news of her visit to the American\r\nEmbassy in July reached Minsk, she was dropped from membership\r\nin “Komsomol,” the Communist Youth Organization,[A13-724] and\r\nthat “meetings were arranged” at which “members of the various\r\norganizations” attempted to dissuade her from leaving the Soviet\r\nUnion.[A13-725] Her aunt and uncle did not speak to her for “a long\r\ntime.”[A13-726] Paul Gregory, to whom Marina taught Russian in the\r\nUnited States, testified that she once referred to this period of her\r\nlife in Minsk as “a very horrible time.”[A13-727]\r\n\r\nOswald wrote to the Embassy again on October 4, to request that the\r\nU.S. Government officially intervene to facilitate his and his wife’s\r\napplications for exit visas.[A13-728] He stated that there had been\r\n“systematic and concerted attempts to intimidate [Marina] * * * into\r\nwithdrawing her application for a visa” which had resulted in her\r\nbeing hospitalized for a 5-day period on September 22 for “nervous\r\nexhaustion.”[A13-729] Marina has denied that she was hospitalized\r\nfor a nervous disorder[A13-730] and he made no mention of it in his\r\ndiary or letters to his family; he probably lied to the Embassy. The\r\nEmbassy replied to his letter on October 12, saying that it had no way\r\nof influencing Soviet conduct on such matters and that its experience\r\nhad been that action on applications for exit visas was “seldom taken\r\nrapidly.”[A13-731]\r\n\r\nIn October 1961 Marina took her annual vacation.[A13-732] She and\r\nOswald agreed that she should get a “change of scenery,”[A13-733] and\r\nshe spent about 3 weeks with an aunt in Khar’kov. It is possible that\r\nthey were not getting along well together during this period.[A13-734]\r\nA diary entry after her return indicates that they were having some\r\nquarrels and that she was wavering in her decision to go to the United\r\nStates, which Oswald attributed to anxiety about their applications\r\nfor visas and the fact that she was pregnant; he in turn dreaded the\r\napproach of the “hard Russian winter.”[A13-735] He noted in his diary\r\nthat he was lonely while she was gone, but that he and his friend\r\n“Erich,” presumably Erik Titovyets, went to some dances and other\r\npublic amusements.[A13-736] On his 22nd birthday he went alone to see\r\nhis favorite opera, “The Queen of Spades.”[A13-737] Marina sent him a\r\ngold and silver cup, inscribed “To my dear husband on his birthday,\r\n18/x/61” and other gifts, for which he wrote to thank her.[A13-738] She\r\nreturned on November 12, in Oswald’s words, “radient, with several jars\r\nof preserses for me from her aunt.”[A13-739]\r\n\r\nSometime after Marina’s return Oswald applied for an interview with\r\nCol. Nicolay Aksenov, an official in the local MVD, in an effort to\r\nexpedite their application for exit visas; he was told by the colonel’s\r\nsubordinates that they were competent to handle the matter. Oswald then\r\ninsisted that Marina seek an interview; she agreed reluctantly. The\r\ninterview was granted;[A13-740] Marina thought that this might have\r\nbeen due to the fact that her uncle was also a high-ranking official in\r\nthe Minsk MVD, but she did not believe that he would personally have\r\npresumed on his official position to obtain special treatment.[A13-741]\r\nColonel Aksenov questioned her about her reasons for wanting to go to\r\nthe United States and, noticing that she was pregnant, suggested that\r\nshe at least delay her departure so that her child could be born in\r\nRussia, but did not otherwise try to discourage her. He finally told\r\nher that there were many others seeking visas and that she and her\r\nhusband would have to wait their turn.[A13-742]\r\n\r\nThroughout this period, Oswald continued to correspond with his mother\r\nand brother. His letters contained the usual chatter among members\r\nof a family and occasional references to the progress of the visa\r\napplications.[A13-743] He wrote to the Embassy on November 1, saying\r\nthat if, as he anticipated, his residence permit were renewed in\r\nJanuary for another year, it would be over his protest.[A13-744] On\r\nNovember 13 the Embassy replied, telling Oswald that retention of his\r\nSoviet passport, which was of the kind issued to persons considered\r\nto be stateless, or an extension of it, would not prejudice his claim\r\nto American citizenship. The letter added that he could discuss the\r\nrenewal of his American passport whenever he appeared in person at the\r\nEmbassy to do so.[A13-745]\r\n\r\nLate in December, Oswald wrote a letter to Senator John G. Tower of\r\nTexas, which was received in Washington near the end of January. He\r\nstated that he was an American citizen and that the Soviet Government\r\nrefused to permit him and his wife to leave the Soviet Union. He asked\r\nSenator Tower to raise “the question of holding by the Soviet Union\r\nof a citizen of the U.S., against his will and expressed desires.”\r\nThe letter was referred to the State Department and no further action\r\nconcerning it was taken.[A13-746] On December 25, Marina was called to\r\nthe Soviet Passport Office and told that exit visas would be granted to\r\nher and her husband; she was surprised, having doubted that she would\r\never be permitted to leave. Oswald wrote to the Embassy on December 27\r\nthat they would be given visas and asked that his passport be extended\r\nwithout another trip to Moscow; he added, however, that he would come\r\nto Moscow if this would expedite the processing of his application. In\r\nhis diary, he wrote, “It’s great (I think?).”[A13-747] Before the year\r\nended, Marina went on maternity leave from her job.[A13-748] They spent\r\nNew Year’s Eve at a dinner party given by the Zigers.[A13-749]\r\n\r\nOswald wrote to his mother on January 2, 1962, and told her that he\r\nand his wife expected to arrive in the United States sometime around\r\nMarch. He asked her to contact the local Red Cross and request that it\r\nput his case before the International Rescue Committee or some other\r\ngroup which aids immigrants to the United States. He told her that he\r\nwould need about $800 and that she should insist on a gift rather than\r\na loan; he told her not to send any of her own money.[A13-750] Despite\r\nhis instructions, she requested a loan from the Red Cross.[A13-751] On\r\nJanuary 13, Oswald wrote to the International Rescue Committee himself;\r\nhe asked for $800 with which to purchase two tickets from Moscow to\r\nTexas.[A13-752] He wrote to the Committee again on January 26, this\r\ntime asking for $1,000.[A13-753]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, letters of Oswald[A13-754] and the American\r\nEmbassy,[A13-755] both dated January 5, crossed in the mail. The\r\nEmbassy’s letter suggested that since there might be difficulties in\r\nobtaining an American visa for Marina, he consider returning alone\r\nand bringing her over later. He replied on the 16th that he would not\r\nleave Russia without her.[A13-756] In his letter, Oswald requested that\r\nthe U.S. Government loan him the money for his and Marina’s airplane\r\ntickets or arrange a loan from another source. The Embassy replied on\r\nJanuary 15 that Marina had not yet obtained an American visa and that\r\nno evidence had yet been submitted that she would not become a public\r\ncharge in the United States.[A13-757] It suggested that Oswald’s mother\r\nor some other close relative file an affidavit of support in Marina’s\r\nbehalf. Before receiving this letter, Oswald wrote out such a document\r\nhimself[A13-758] and mailed it to the Embassy.[A13-759]\r\n\r\nOn January 23, after receiving the Embassy’s letter, he wrote that his\r\nown affidavit should be sufficient, since he had been away from the\r\nUnited States for more than 2 years and could not be expected to obtain\r\nan affidavit from someone else.[A13-760] But on the same day, he wrote\r\nto his mother asking that she file an affidavit of support with the\r\nImmigration and Naturalization Service.[A13-761] On January 24, the\r\nEmbassy acknowledged receipt of his affidavit, but again suggested that\r\nhe obtain one from someone else.[A13-762]\r\n\r\nLate in January, Oswald received a letter from his mother telling\r\nhim that he had been given a dishonorable discharge from the\r\nMarines.[A13-763] (The discharge had actually been “undesirable,” a\r\nless derogatory characterization.)[A13-764] This apparently revived his\r\nfear of prosecution, and on January 30, he wrote to his brother for\r\nmore information.[A13-765] On the same day he wrote also to John B.\r\nConnally, Jr., then Governor of Texas, who Oswald believed was still\r\nSecretary of Navy. The letter read:\r\n\r\n    I wish to call your attention to a case about which you may\r\n    have personal knowlege since you are a resident of Ft. Worth as\r\n    I am.\r\n\r\n    In November 1959 an event was well publicated in the Ft. Worth\r\n    newspapers concerning a person who had gone to the Soviet Union\r\n    to reside for a short time, (much in the same way E. Hemingway\r\n    resided in Paris.)\r\n\r\n    This person in answers to questions put to him by reporteds\r\n    in Moscow criticized certain facets of american life. The\r\n    story was blown up into another “turncoat” sensation, with the\r\n    result that the Navy department gave this person a belated\r\n    dishonourable discharge, although he had received an honourable\r\n    discharge after three years service on Sept. 11, 1959 at El\r\n    Toro, Marine corps base in California.\r\n\r\n    These are the basic facts of _my_ case.\r\n\r\n    I have and allways had the full sanction of the U.S. Embassy,\r\n    Moscow USSR, and hence the U.S. goverment. In as much as I\r\n    am returning to the U.S.A. in this year with the aid of the\r\n    U.S. Embassy, bring with me my family (since I married in the\r\n    USSR) I shall employ all means to right this gross mistake or\r\n    injustice to a boni-fied U.S. citizen and _ex_-service man. The\r\n    U.S. government has no charges or complaints against me. I ask\r\n    you to look into this case and take the neccessary steps to\r\n    repair the damage done to me and my family. For information I\r\n    would direct you to consult the American Embassy, Chikovski St.\r\n    19/21, Moscow, USSR.[A13-766]\r\n\r\nConnally referred the letter to the Department of the Navy,[A13-767]\r\nwhich sent Oswald a letter stating that the Department contemplated no\r\nchange in the undesirable discharge.[A13-768] On March 22, Oswald wrote\r\nto the Department insisting that his discharge be given a further,\r\nfull review.[A13-769] The Department promptly replied that it had no\r\nauthority to hear and review petitions of this sort and referred Oswald\r\nto the Navy Discharge Review Board.[A13-770] Oswald filled out the\r\nenclosed application for review in Minsk but did not mail it until he\r\nreturned to the United States.[A13-771]\r\n\r\nThe Department of State had notified Oswald’s mother that it\r\nwould need $900 to make the travel arrangements for her son and\r\ndaughter-in-law.[A13-772] On February 1, Oswald sent his mother a brief\r\nletter rejecting her suggestion that she try to raise money by telling\r\nthe newspapers about his financial plight.[A13-773] Five days later,\r\nthe Embassy wrote to Oswald and asked him to make formal application\r\nfor a loan.[A13-774] Oswald wrote to his mother again on February 9,\r\nreminding her to file an affidavit of support and asking that she send\r\nhim clippings from the Fort Worth newspapers about his defection to\r\nRussia, a request which he later repeated to his brother. He told her\r\nthat he wanted to know what had been written about him, so that he\r\ncould be “forewarned.”[A13-775]\r\n\r\nOswald took Marina to the hospital on the morning of February 15. A\r\nbaby girl was born at about 10 a.m.[A13-776] He had gone on to the\r\nfactory where news of the birth awaited him on his arrival.[A13-777]\r\nIn accordance with regular hospital practice,[A13-778] he did not see\r\nthe baby until Marina left the hospital.[A13-779] He was excited by\r\nthe child,[A13-780] who was named “June Lee” in accordance with the\r\nRussian custom and law that a child’s second name must be the father’s\r\nfirst name or a variation of it. He had wanted to name his child “June\r\nMarina,” and protested the application of the law to her, since he\r\nhad a United States passport. His diary contains the wry comment,\r\n“Po-Russki.”[A13-781] His coworkers at the factory gave the Oswalds\r\n“one summer blanket, 6 light diapers, 4 warm diapers, 2 chemises,\r\n3 very good warm chemises, 4 very nice suits and two toys” for the\r\nbaby.[A13-782] Marina came home on February 23.[A13-783]\r\n\r\nThere was less urgency about the departure for the United States after\r\nJune Lee was born.[A13-784] Oswald wrote to his mother,[A13-785] and\r\nbrother,[A13-786] that he would probably not arrive for several months.\r\nThe Embassy received a letter on March 3, in which Oswald applied for\r\na loan of $800;[A13-787] the Embassy replied that it was authorized\r\nto loan him only $500.[A13-788] It had in the meantime decided that\r\nhis own affidavit of support for Marina would be sufficient under the\r\ncircumstances.[A13-789] On March 15, he received notification from the\r\nImmigration and Naturalization Service that Marina’s application for\r\na visa had been approved.[A13-790] By March 28, he had received an\r\naffidavit of support in Marina’s behalf from his mother’s employer,\r\nByron K. Phillips,[A13-791] which he filed although it was no longer\r\nnecessary to do so.[A13-792] A few days before, Marina, still on\r\nmaternity leave, had quit her job.[A13-793] Discussions with the\r\nEmbassy to complete financial and travel arrangements continued in\r\nApril and May.[A13-794] In a letter to Robert on April 12, Oswald wrote\r\nthat only “the American side” was holding up their departure, but added\r\nthat the winter being over, he didn’t “really * * * want to leave until\r\nthe beginning of fall, since the spring and summer * * * [in Russia]\r\nare so nice.”[A13-795]\r\n\r\nOn May 10, the Embassy wrote that everything was in order and suggested\r\nthat Oswald come to the Embassy with his family to sign the final\r\npapers.[A13-796] At his request,[A13-797] he was discharged from the\r\nfactory on about May 18.[A13-798] His work had apparently never been\r\nvery good. Marina testified that he was rather lazy and resented having\r\nto take orders.[A13-799] This estimate is confirmed by a report of the\r\nplant director and personnel department chief, filed on December 11,\r\n1961, which was apparently a routine assessment of his work. The report\r\nnoted that he did not “display the initiative for increasing his skill”\r\nin his job, that he was “over-sensitive * * * to remarks from the\r\nforemen, and * * * careless in his work”; Oswald took “no part in the\r\nsocial life of the shop” and kept “very much to himself.”[A13-800]\r\n\r\nOswald picked up his Soviet exit visa on May 22;[A13-801] at about this\r\ntime, he also had an interview with an official of the MVD to obtain\r\nfinal clearance for his departure.[A13-802] He wrote to Robert that he\r\nand his family would leave for Moscow on the following day and depart\r\nfor England 10 to 14 days later. He expected to cross the Atlantic by\r\nship, probably docking in New Orleans. Returning to a point which he\r\nhad made in an earlier letter to his mother, he commented that he knew\r\nfrom the newspaper clippings what Robert had said about him when he\r\nleft for Russia; he thought that Robert had talked too much at that\r\ntime, and asked that Robert say nothing to the newspapers now.[A13-803]\r\n\r\nThe Oswalds arrived in Moscow by May 24[A13-804] and on that date\r\nfilled out various documents at the American Embassy;[A13-805] Marina\r\nwas given her American visa.[A13-806] Final arrangements for their\r\nemigration were made with Soviet officials.[A13-807] On June 1,\r\nOswald signed a promissory note at the Embassy for a repatriation\r\nloan of $435.71.[A13-808] He and his family boarded a train for\r\nHolland,[A13-809] which passed through Minsk that night.[A13-810] They\r\ncrossed the Soviet frontier at Brest on June 2. Two days later, they\r\ndeparted from Holland on the SS _Maasdam_.[A13-811] Onboard ship, the\r\nOswalds stayed by themselves; Marina testified that she did not often\r\ngo on deck because she was poorly dressed and Oswald was ashamed of\r\nher.[A13-812]\r\n\r\nProbably while he was on board the _Maasdam_ Oswald wrote some notes\r\non ship stationery, which appear to be a summary of what he thought he\r\nhad learned by living under both the capitalist and Communist systems.\r\nThe notes reflect his unhappy and deepening feeling of disillusionment\r\nwith both the Soviet Union and the United States. Oswald observed that\r\nalthough reform groups may oppose the government in power, they always\r\ndeclare that they are for their people and their country, and he asked\r\nwhat “would happen if somebody was to stand up and say he was utterly\r\nopposed not only to the governments, but to the people, too the entire\r\nland and complete foundations” of his society. He condemned existing\r\npolitical groups and proposed the formation of a third choice between\r\ncommunism and capitalism, neither of which was acceptable to him. “I\r\nhave lived,” he said, “under both systems, I have _sought_ the answers\r\nand although it would be very easy to dupe myself into believing one\r\nsystem is better than the other, I know they are not.” In these notes,\r\nhe acknowledged that his “Red Cross” subsidy had been paid by the\r\nSoviet Government rather than the international organization, and said,\r\n“I shall never sell myself intentionlly, or unintentionlly to anyone\r\nagain.”[A13-813] (Commission Exhibit No. 25, p. 273.) It was probably\r\nalso onboard ship that Oswald wrote two sets of answers to questions\r\nwhich he anticipated about his decision to go to Russia and later to\r\nreturn to the United States. Although the sets of answers are somewhat\r\nsimilar, but the tone of one is apologetic, while the other suggests\r\nthat Oswald went to Russia to study the Soviet system, but remained a\r\nloyal American and owed no apologies.[A13-814]\r\n\r\nThe _Maasdam_ landed at Hoboken, N.J., on June 13.[A13-815] The Oswalds\r\nwere met by Spas T. Raikin, a representative of the Traveler’s Aid\r\nSociety, which had been contacted by the Department of State; Raikin\r\nhad the impression that Oswald was trying to avoid meeting anyone. He\r\ntold Raikin that he had only $63 and had no plans either for that night\r\nor for travel to Fort Worth, and accepted the society’s help, according\r\nto Raikin, “with confidence and appreciation.”[A13-816] They passed\r\nthrough the immigration office without incident,[A13-817] and Raikin\r\nhelped them through customs.[A13-818]\r\n\r\nThe society referred the Oswalds to the New York City Department\r\nof Welfare, which helped them find a room at the Times Square\r\nHotel.[A13-819] Oswald told both Raikin and representatives of\r\nthe welfare department that he had been a marine stationed at the\r\nAmerican Embassy in Moscow, had married a Russian girl, renounced his\r\ncitizenship, and worked in Minsk; he soon found out, he said, that the\r\nRussian propaganda was inaccurate but had not been able to obtain an\r\nexit visa for his wife and child for more than 2 years. He said also\r\nthat he had paid the travel expenses himself.[A13-820]\r\n\r\nThe welfare department called Robert Oswald’s home in Fort Worth. His\r\nwife answered and said that they would help. She contacted her husband\r\nwho sent $200 immediately.[A13-821] Oswald refused to accept the money\r\nand insisted that the department itself should pay the fare to Texas;\r\nhe threatened that they would go as far as they could on $63 and rely\r\non local authorities to get them the rest of the way. In the end he\r\naccepted the money.[A13-822] On the afternoon of June 14, the Oswalds\r\nleft New York by plane for Fort Worth.[A13-823]\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT WORTH, DALLAS, NEW ORLEANS\r\n\r\nOswald had originally indicated that he and his family would stay with\r\nhis mother in Vernon, Tex.[A13-824] His decision to stay with Robert\r\nOswald in Fort Worth apparently had been prompted by his brother’s\r\ninvitation in a letter to him in Russia.[A13-825] Oswald listed only\r\nhis brother as a relative on an “Intake Interview” form which he\r\nprepared for the New York Department of Welfare.[A13-826]\r\n\r\nRobert took his wife and children to Love Field, the Dallas airport,\r\nto meet Lee and Marina and their baby, June Lee.[A13-827] He testified\r\nthat the most noticeable change in his brother’s appearance was that\r\nhe had become rather bald; he seemed also to be somewhat thinner\r\nthan he had been in 1959. Robert thought that his brother had picked\r\nup “something of an accent” but, except for these changes was “the\r\nsame boy” whom he had known before.[A13-828] Lee commented on the\r\nabsence of newspaper reporters and seemed to Robert to be disappointed\r\nthat none had appeared.[A13-829] Later on, Lee was anxious to avoid\r\npublicity.[A13-830]\r\n\r\nRobert drove the Oswalds to his home at 7313 Davenport Street.[A13-831]\r\nFor a few days, Lee seemed tense,[A13-832] but the brothers got along\r\nwell,[A13-833] and to Robert it was “more or less * * * [as if Lee]\r\nhad not been to Russia”; they were “just together again.”[A13-834]\r\nThey did not discuss politics, according to Robert because of a\r\n“tacit agreement” between them.[A13-835] Lee indicated to his\r\nbrother that he hoped to have his undesirable discharge from the\r\nMarines corrected.[A13-836] Robert and his wife “took to Marina and\r\nJune,” and enjoyed showing Marina “things that she had never seen\r\nbefore.”[A13-837] Marina rested and took care of her baby, and when she\r\ncould, helped in the household.[A13-838] She testified that, apart from\r\na trip to the library, Lee spent about a week “merely talking.”[A13-839]\r\n\r\nOn June 18, 4 days after he arrived in Fort Worth, Oswald went to the\r\noffice of Mrs. Pauline Virginia Bates, a public stenographer whose name\r\nhe had found in the telephone directory,[A13-840] and asked her to type\r\na manuscript from the “scraps of paper,” on which he had recorded his\r\nimpressions of the Soviet Union.[A13-841] Intrigued by his tale that\r\nhe had just returned from the Soviet Union and had smuggled his notes\r\nout of that country, she agreed to type the notes for $1 per page or\r\n$2 an hour, 50 cents less than her usual hourly rate.[A13-842] On that\r\nday and the succeeding 2 days, Mrs. Bates spent 8 hours typing for\r\nOswald while he remained in her office helping her with the notes and\r\ntranslating portions of them which were in Russian.[A13-843] At the end\r\nof each session he collected his notes and as much of the manuscript\r\nas she had done and took them away with him.[A13-844] On June 20, he\r\ngave Mrs. Bates $10 for the 10 completed pages; he told her that he had\r\nno more money and refused to accept her offer to postpone payment or\r\ncontinue the work for nothing.[A13-845]\r\n\r\nOswald told Mrs. Bates that there was an engineer in Fort Worth who\r\nwanted to help him publish his notes.[A13-846] On June 19,[A13-847]\r\nhe had called Peter Gregory, a petroleum engineer who was born in\r\nSiberia and taught Russian at the Fort Worth Public Library as a “civic\r\nenterprise.”[A13-848] He asked if Gregory could give him a letter\r\ntestifying to his ability to read and speak Russian, so that he could\r\nobtain work as an interpreter or translator. Gregory suggested that\r\nOswald come to his office, where Gregory opened a Russian book at\r\nrandom and asked Oswald to read from it. Oswald read well, and Gregory\r\ngave him the letter he wanted.[A13-849] Gregory and Oswald had lunch\r\ntogether and discussed Oswald’s life in the Soviet Union,[A13-850] but,\r\naccording to Gregory’s testimony, nothing was said about publishing\r\nOswald’s manuscript.[A13-851] About a week later, Gregory and his son\r\nPaul, a college student, visited the Oswalds at Robert Oswald’s home\r\nand arranged for Marina to give Paul lessons in Russian during the\r\nsummer.[A13-852]\r\n\r\nOn June 26, Oswald was interviewed by FBI agents in Fort\r\nWorth.[A13-853] One of the agents who interviewed him described\r\nhim as tense and “drawn up”; he said that Oswald “exhibited an\r\narrogant attitude * * * and [was] inclined to be just a little\r\ninsolent.”[A13-854] Oswald declined to say why he had gone to Russia,\r\nsaying that he refused to “relive the past.”[A13-855] He said that he\r\nhad not attempted to obtain Soviet citizenship, had not been approached\r\nby Soviet officials for information about his experiences in the\r\nMarines, and had not offered them such information. Marina’s Soviet\r\npassport required her to notify the Soviet Embassy in Washington of her\r\naddress in this country, and Oswald told the agents that he planned\r\nto contact the Embassy for this purpose within a few days.[A13-856]\r\nHe promised to notify the FBI if he were contacted by Soviet agents\r\n“under suspicious circumstances or otherwise.”[A13-857] Oswald told\r\nhis brother about the interview, saying that it had been “just\r\nfine.”[A13-858]\r\n\r\nOswald and his family remained with Robert for about a month.[A13-859]\r\nWhile they were there his mother moved to Fort Worth from Crowell,\r\nTex.,[A13-860] and, sometime in July they moved into her apartment\r\nat 1501 West Seventh Street.[A13-861] Mrs. Oswald testified that she\r\nhad visited them at Robert’s house in June[A13-862] and moved to Fort\r\nWorth because she thought that the house was too crowded and wanted\r\nto help them.[A13-863] Mrs. Oswald described the period when her son\r\nand his family lived with her as “a very happy month”; according to\r\nher testimony, she and her son and daughter-in-law got along well. She\r\nmentioned that she not only helped Marina keep house and care for the\r\nbaby but also aided her son in his efforts to find employment.[A13-864]\r\nMarina testified, however, that Lee did not get along well with his\r\nmother and that he decided after several weeks that they should move\r\nto their own apartment.[A13-865] He did not file a change-of-address\r\ncard at the post office when the family moved to West Seventh\r\nStreet, as he did when they made their next move,[A13-866] so he may\r\nhave contemplated from the beginning that they would stay with his\r\nmother for only a short while. Around the middle of August,[A13-867]\r\nthe Oswalds moved to a one-bedroom furnished apartment at 2703\r\nMercedes Street, for which they paid $59.50 in advance for 1 month’s\r\nrent.[A13-868]\r\n\r\nIn the third week in July, Oswald had obtained a job as a sheet metal\r\nworker with the Louv-R-Pak Division of the Leslie Welding Co.,[A13-869]\r\na manufacturer of louvers and ventilators,[A13-870] to which he\r\nhad been referred by the Texas Employment Commission.[A13-871] On\r\nhis application for employment, filled out several days before, he\r\nwrote falsely that he had had experience as a sheet metal worker and\r\nmachinist in the Marines and had been honorably discharged.[A13-872]\r\nHe usually worked 8 or 9 hours a day, for which he was paid $1.25\r\nan hour.[A13-873] Marina testified that Oswald did not like his\r\nwork,[A13-874] but he was regarded as a good employee[A13-875] and\r\nremained with the company until October, when he quit.[A13-876] On the\r\njob, he kept to himself and was considered uncommunicative.[A13-877]\r\n\r\nMrs. Oswald visited her son and his family at their apartment and tried\r\nto help them get settled; she testified that she bought some clothes\r\nfor Marina and a highchair for the baby but that Oswald told her that\r\nhe did not want her to buy “things for his wife that he himself could\r\nnot buy.”[A13-878] Finally, Oswald apparently decided that he did not\r\nwant his mother to visit the apartment anymore and he became incensed\r\nwhen his wife permitted her to visit despite his instructions.[A13-879]\r\nAfter he moved to Dallas in October, Oswald did not see his mother or\r\ncommunicate with her in any way until she came to see him after the\r\nassassination.[A13-880] Witnesses have described the Mercedes Street\r\napartment as “decrepit” and very poorly furnished;[A13-881] there was\r\nno telephone service.[A13-882] Acquaintances observed that Marina and\r\nthe baby were poorly clothed, that the Oswalds had little food, and\r\nthat at first there was not a bed for the baby.[A13-883]\r\n\r\nOn August 16, the FBI again interviewed Oswald. This interview took\r\nplace in the back seat of a car in front of his home and covered\r\nsubstantially the same material as the previous interview. Oswald again\r\ndenied having made any deal with representatives of the Soviet Union.\r\nHe protested his undesirable discharge from the Marines, and stated\r\nthat his wife was registered at the Soviet Embassy. He still refused to\r\ndiscuss why he had gone to the Soviet Union, but he was less hostile\r\nthan he had been during the previous interview.[A13-884] According to\r\nhis wife, however, he was very upset by the interest the FBI showed in\r\nhim.[A13-885]\r\n\r\nThe Oswalds became acquainted with a growing number of people of the\r\nRussian-speaking community in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, who were tied\r\ntogether socially by a common origin, language, and religion. The group\r\nwas not restricted to people from Russia but was composed primarily\r\nof people from Eastern European countries.[A13-886] The Oswalds’\r\ninitial contact with this group was through Peter Gregory. Marina gave\r\nconversational Russian lessons to Paul Gregory 2 days a week during\r\nAugust and early September, for which she was paid $35. Most of the\r\nlessons took place at the Mercedes Street apartment and Oswald was\r\ngenerally present.[A13-887] In addition, Paul Gregory occasionally took\r\nthe Oswalds shopping; after they became friendly, he had a number of\r\ndiscussions with Oswald, some of them politically oriented.[A13-888]\r\n\r\nSometime around August 25, Peter Gregory invited the Oswalds and\r\nseveral members of the Russian community to his house for dinner. One\r\nof the guests was George Bouhe, a Dallas accountant and a leader of the\r\nRussian community. He was very interested in meeting and conversing\r\nwith Marina, because she had spent much of her life in Leningrad, which\r\nwas his birthplace.[A13-889] Also present was Mrs. Anna Meller, the\r\nRussian-born wife of a Dallas department store employee.[A13-890] Near\r\nthe end of August, the Oswalds met Declan Ford, a consulting geologist\r\nin the Dallas area, and his Russian-born wife at Mrs. Meller’s home.\r\nThe Oswalds were also introduced to Mrs. Elena Hall, who was born in\r\nTehran, Iran, of Russian parentage. She worked in a dental laboratory\r\nand at this time was divorced from her former husband John Hall, whom\r\nshe subsequently remarried. In order to obtain dental aid for Marina,\r\nGeorge Bouhe had brought her to Mrs. Hall’s house.[A13-891] In early\r\nSeptember, the Oswalds met Alexander Kleinlerer, another member of\r\nthe Russian group, who was then courting Mrs. Hall.[A13-892] Mrs. Max\r\nClark was introduced to Marina during this period by George Bouhe and\r\nAnna Meller. Max Clark met the Oswalds at a later time.[A13-893] At\r\nabout the same time, they were visited by George De Mohrenschildt, a\r\npetroleum engineer born in Russia,[A13-894] who had heard of them from\r\none of the Russian-speaking group.[A13-895] Later on, the Oswalds met\r\nhis wife, Jeanne, and his daughter and son-in-law, Gary and Alexandra\r\nTaylor.[A13-896]\r\n\r\nMost of the members of the Russian community were interested in the\r\nOswalds not only because they needed help, but also because they\r\ncould provide the latest information about what was happening in\r\nRussia.[A13-897] Some members of the group were at first apprehensive\r\nabout them because the apparent ease with which they had left\r\nRussia seemed suspicious.[A13-898] Nevertheless, many of the group\r\nprovided small amounts of money, groceries, clothing, and furniture\r\nfor the Oswalds; George Bouhe, Anna Meller, and Elena Hall were the\r\nprimary contributors, although others provided help in the form of\r\ntransportation and groceries.[A13-899] These acquaintances occasionally\r\nvisited the Oswalds, and the Oswalds in turn visited some of them in\r\nDallas.[A13-900]\r\n\r\nIt was evident that Oswald did not appreciate the help of the Russian\r\ncommunity.[A13-901] At least once he flew into a rage and shouted\r\nthat he did not need any of the things that people were giving to\r\nhim.[A13-902] Some felt that he resented the gifts because he could not\r\ngive his wife what the others were providing;[A13-903] he apparently\r\nwas critical of them also because he felt that they were overly\r\nconcerned with improving themselves economically.[A13-904]\r\n\r\nOswald became increasingly unpopular with his Russian-speaking\r\nacquaintances, partly because of his resentment of their\r\nassistance.[A13-905] Alexander Kleinlerer stated that none of them\r\ncared for Oswald “because of his political philosophy, his criticism of\r\nthe United States, his apparent lack of interest in anyone but himself\r\nand because of his treatment of Marina.”[A13-906] Some of them believed\r\nthat Oswald was mentally disturbed.[A13-907] However, they felt sorry\r\nfor Marina and the child and continued to help.[A13-908]\r\n\r\nOn a weekend afternoon early in October, the Oswalds were visited by\r\nhis mother and a number of people from the Russian community, including\r\nGeorge Bouhe, Anna Meller, the Halls, the De Mohrenschildts, and the\r\nTaylors.[A13-909] Oswald had apparently decided to look for a new job,\r\nand discussed his lack of job prospects and the fact that his rent\r\nwas overdue.[A13-910] He was advised to seek employment in the Dallas\r\narea.[A13-911] Elena Hall invited Marina to move into her house in Fort\r\nWorth until Oswald found a job in Dallas. She accepted the proposal,\r\nand Mrs. Hall moved Marina, her daughter June, and the Oswalds’ few\r\nhousehold goods in a pickup truck belonging to the dental laboratory\r\nwhere she was employed.[A13-912]\r\n\r\nOswald worked at the Leslie Welding Co. on Monday, October 8,\r\nbut failed to appear on the following day. He was already in\r\nDallas.[A13-913] He falsely told his wife that he had been\r\ndischarged,[A13-914] and told George Bouhe that the job had been a\r\ntemporary one.[A13-915] Sometime later, the company received an undated\r\nletter from him stating that he had “moved permanently to Dallas,”\r\nand asking that the wages due him be forwarded to him at box 2915 in\r\nDallas.[A13-916] He did not tell his mother that he was leaving Fort\r\nWorth.[A13-917]\r\n\r\nWhile they were in Fort Worth, the Oswalds were having marital\r\nproblems.[A13-918] Several people noted that Marina had a blackened eye\r\nwhen they visited her at the Mercedes Street apartment.[A13-919] She\r\ntold her mother-in-law and George Bouhe that her husband had struck\r\nher, but said to Anna Meller that she had walked into a door.[A13-920]\r\nIt seems clear that Oswald had in fact hit her.[A13-921] People\r\nobserved friction between the Oswalds on various occasions,[A13-922]\r\nalthough their disputes became more apparent later. Marina has written\r\nthat this was a difficult period for them and that her husband was\r\n“very irritable” and sometimes some completely trivial thing would\r\n“drive him into a rage.”[A13-923]\r\n\r\nShe testified that:\r\n\r\n    * * * immediately after coming to the United States Lee\r\n    changed. I did not know him as such a man in Russia. * * * He\r\n    helped me as before, but he became a little more of a recluse\r\n    * * * He was very irritable, sometimes for a trifle * * *[A13-924]\r\n\r\nShe has denied, however, that their separation was the result of\r\nquarrels between them.[A13-925]\r\n\r\nMarina spent the first few weeks after Oswald’s departure at Elena\r\nHall’s house in Fort Worth, except for a brief stay at Gary Taylor’s\r\nhouse in Dallas after one of her appointments at the Baylor Dental\r\nClinic.[A13-926] While she was in Dallas, Mrs. De Mohrenschildt brought\r\nher to the clinic on October 8, October 10, and October 15;[A13-927]\r\nGeorge Bouhe had given Mrs. De Mohrenschildt the money to cover the\r\nexpense of Marina’s dental care.[A13-928]\r\n\r\nEven before Oswald went to Dallas, some of his acquaintances were\r\nhelping him in his effort to find a job there.[A13-929] George De\r\nMohrenschildt directed him to Samuel B. Ballen, a Dallas financial\r\nconsultant, but no employment resulted.[A13-930] George Bouhe\r\nrecommended that Oswald go to the Texas Employment Commission in\r\nDallas; and Anna Meller had her husband ask Mrs. Helen Cunningham, a\r\ncounselor in the clerical and sales division of the Dallas office of\r\nthe employment commission, to help Oswald find a job.[A13-931] Oswald\r\nfirst came into the office of the employment commission on October 9.\r\nHe was reluctant to accept industrial employment, and was placed in the\r\nclerical category and turned over to Mrs. Cunningham for counseling. He\r\nindicated that he had an interest in writing. The results of general\r\naptitude tests which he had taken at the Fort Worth employment office\r\nhad been transmitted to the Dallas office, and indicated that he had\r\nsome aptitude in this direction and for clerical work. It was noted\r\non his application form that he had “outstanding verbal-clerical\r\npotential.” He demonstrated ability to perform many skilled and\r\nsemi-skilled jobs, and there was some indication that he could do\r\ncollege work. Mrs. Cunningham gave him three special tests: for general\r\nclerical work, work as an insurance claims examiner, and drafting work.\r\nHe scored high on all three. His application form indicated that he\r\ndid not have a driver’s license, and noted: “well-groomed and spoken,\r\nbusiness suit, alert replies--expresses self extremely well.” He told\r\nMrs. Cunningham that he hoped to develop qualifications for responsible\r\njunior executive employment by a work-study program at a local college\r\nbut that this must be delayed because of his immediate financial needs\r\nand responsibilities.[A13-932]\r\n\r\nMrs. Cunningham concluded that although Oswald would be classified\r\nfor clerical work, she should try to get him any available job, since\r\nhe badly needed money. He was referred to an architect for an opening\r\nas a messenger but was not hired. On October 11, he was referred to\r\nJaggars-Chiles-Stovall Co., a graphic arts company, in response to\r\na call from John Graef, head of the photographic department of the\r\ncompany, who had told the employment commission that he needed a\r\nphotoprint trainee. Oswald was enthusiastic about his prospects and\r\napparently made a good impression; Graef picked him over several other\r\napplicants.[A13-933] On the following day he began working in his\r\nnew position as a trainee making prints of advertising material. He\r\nworked a 40-hour week at approximately $1.35 per hour; his take-home\r\npay varied from $49 to $74 a week.[A13-934] According to his wife, “he\r\nliked his work very much.”[A13-935]\r\n\r\nOswald moved into the YMCA on October 15, and stayed there until\r\nOctober 19, paying $2.25 a night.[A13-936] He had used the\r\nTaylors’ address and telephone number as a place where he could be\r\nreached,[A13-937] but on October 9 had also rented post office box 2915\r\nunder his own name at the main post office on Ervay Street.[A13-938] On\r\nOctober 10, he filed a change-of-address form indicating that mail for\r\n2703 Mercedes Street should be forwarded to the box.[A13-939] Marina\r\nhas written that Oswald wrote her letters and telephoned her during the\r\nseparation.[A13-940]\r\n\r\nOn October 16, Mrs Hall brought Marina and June to Dallas to have\r\nJune baptized. Marina apparently did this surreptitiously, because\r\nher husband opposed baptism; they did not contact him in Dallas, but\r\nleft birthday gifts for him at the Taylors. Oswald did not appear very\r\ndisturbed when he found out about the baptism.[A13-941]\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Mrs. Hall had an automobile accident and went to the\r\nhospital, where she remained until October 26; Marina remained in the\r\nHall house. Mrs. Max Clark and Alexander Kleinlerer, a friend of Mrs.\r\nHall, checked up to make sure that she was getting along without too\r\nmuch trouble.[A13-942] After Oswald left the YMCA on October 19, he\r\nmoved to a room or apartment somewhere in Dallas,[A13-943] which has\r\nnot been located.[A13-944] It seems likely, however, that during that\r\ntime he spent several weekends with Marina at the Hall house.[A13-945]\r\n\r\nFour days after Mrs. Hall returned from the hospital, she left for New\r\nYork to visit friends. By the time she returned, Marina had moved to a\r\nthree-room apartment at 604 Elsbeth Street in Dallas, which Oswald had\r\nrented on Saturday, November 3;[A13-946] the landlady stated that he\r\nhad looked at the apartment about a week before. The monthly rent was\r\n$68, in addition to which he had to pay several dollars a month for\r\nutilities. He paid the rent plus a $5 deposit on November 3,[A13-947]\r\nbut probably spent that night with Marina at the Hall house. On Sunday\r\nthe Taylors helped the Oswalds move their belongings to the Elsbeth\r\nStreet apartment with a rented trailer.[A13-948] Oswald had asked\r\nKleinlerer to help them move, and Kleinlerer also was present when they\r\ndeparted.[A13-949]\r\n\r\nSoon after the Oswalds were reunited, their marital difficulties\r\nstarted again. While they were moving to Elsbeth Street, Kleinlerer\r\nnoticed that Oswald slapped his wife for not having the zipper on her\r\ndress completely closed.[A13-950] They argued over his refusal to\r\nallow her to smoke.[A13-951] There was a quarrel also when he told\r\nthe landlady that Marina was from Czechoslovakia; he was angered when\r\nMarina, who disapproved of this deception, told the landlady the\r\ntruth.[A13-952]\r\n\r\nAlthough several people tried to help Marina improve her scanty\r\nknowledge of English, Oswald discouraged this,[A13-953] perhaps\r\nbecause he wanted to keep up his Russian.[A13-954] Some witnesses\r\ntestified that she commented about his sexual abilities.[A13-955]\r\nHe apparently continued to beat her, and once she suggested to\r\nGeorge De Mohrenschildt that she should “get away” from Oswald.\r\nWhen De Mohrenschildt criticized Oswald’s conduct, Oswald replied,\r\n“It is my business.”[A13-956] Marina testified that when they moved\r\ninto the Elsbeth Street apartment, her husband became “nervous and\r\nirritable” and was very angry over “trifles.”[A13-957] She said that\r\nit was sometimes her fault that he beat her,[A13-958] for example\r\nwhen she wrote to an old boyfriend in Russia that she wished she had\r\nmarried him; the letter was returned for postage due, and Oswald read\r\nit.[A13-959]\r\n\r\nBecause of this quarreling, a few of their acquaintances felt that\r\nMarina would be better off alone. George Bouhe offered to help her if\r\nshe promised to leave Oswald permanently.[A13-960] Finally, in early\r\nNovember, Marina, helped by the De Mohrenschildts, moved into Anna\r\nMeller’s house with the intention not to return to Oswald. He was\r\napparently quite upset and did not want Marina to leave him.[A13-961]\r\n\r\nOswald did not visit his wife at Anna Meller’s house,[A13-962]\r\nand for a short time did not even know where she was.[A13-963]\r\nAccording to Marina, he called her after she moved and they met at De\r\nMohrenschildt’s house. He asked her to return home. She insisted that\r\nhe stop quarreling and that he change his ways. He said that he could\r\nnot change. Marina would not agree to return home with him and he\r\nleft.[A13-964]\r\n\r\nMarina was uncomfortable at the Meller house, where there was very\r\nlittle room. She moved to Katherine Ford’s house[A13-965] where she\r\napparently stayed from November 11 to 17. She indicated that she had\r\ndecided never to return to her husband;[A13-966] it was Mrs. Ford’s\r\nimpression that Marina was going to stay at other people’s houses\r\nuntil a permanent place could be found for her.[A13-967] When Mr. Ford\r\nreturned from a business trip on November 17, Marina and June moved to\r\nthe home of Mrs. Frank Ray, where they spent the day. Mrs. Ray, the\r\nwife of a Dallas advertising man, was also of Russian origin. Since\r\nMrs. Ray had no baby bed, Marina returned to the Fords that evening.\r\nOn the next day, however, Marina moved her belongings to the Rays’\r\nhouse. That same day, Oswald called and asked to visit his wife, whom\r\nhe had called and written. Mr. Ray picked him up and took him to\r\nMarina.[A13-968]\r\n\r\nMarina testified that at this meeting Oswald professed his love for\r\nher. She stated: “I saw him cry * * * [he] begged me to come back,\r\nasked my forgiveness, and promised that he would try to improve, if\r\nonly I would come back.”[A13-969] On another occasion she said: “* * *\r\nhe cried and you know a woman’s heart--I went back to him. He said he\r\ndidn’t care to live if I did not return.”[A13-970] That same day she\r\ndecided to return to him. Mr. Ray packed her belongings and took her\r\nback to the Elsbeth Street apartment.[A13-971]\r\n\r\nMembers of the Russian community who had taken care of Marina so\r\nthat she would not have to live with Oswald felt that their efforts\r\nhad been in vain. George Bouhe was so irritated that he never again\r\ntried to help either of the Oswalds.[A13-972] Contacts between them\r\nand members of the Russian community diminished markedly.[A13-973]\r\nOswald did not care for most of these people and made his feelings\r\napparent.[A13-974] Even the De Mohrenschildts, whom he liked most,\r\nsaw much less of them.[A13-975] Lydia Dymitruk, another Russian born\r\nwoman in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, testified that she saw the Oswalds\r\non only one occasion, and did not care to see them again. She drove\r\nMarina and June, who had a high fever, to the hospital; Oswald told the\r\nhospital that he was unemployed in order to avoid paying for June’s\r\ntreatment and later left Mrs. Dymitruk without thanking her.[A13-976]\r\nMrs. Ford testified that Marina had told her that she contemplated\r\nsuicide during this period because Oswald was treating her badly and\r\nshe had no friends; she felt that she had “no way out.”[A13-977] Marina\r\nacknowledged to the Commission that she had had such thoughts.[A13-978]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an effort to renew family ties, Robert Oswald wrote to Lee and John\r\nPic on November 17, inviting them and their families to Thanksgiving\r\ndinner. Lee accepted the invitation. He and Marina traveled to Fort\r\nWorth by bus on Thanksgiving Day, and John Pic and Robert met them at\r\nthe station.[A13-979] Pic had not seen his half-brother for 10 years.\r\nHe observed, as many others have also attested, that Lee seemed to be\r\na good father and to take an active interest in June.[A13-980] After\r\ndinner, Marina phoned Paul Gregory, who later drove the Oswalds to his\r\nhouse for sandwiches and then took them to the bus station for the\r\nreturn trip to Dallas.[A13-981] Thereafter, Robert spoke to his brother\r\nonce by telephone and received a post card and a letter from him, but\r\nhe eventually lost contact with Lee and did not see him again until\r\nafter the assassination.[A13-982]\r\n\r\nDespite his disillusionment with Soviet life, Oswald kept up his\r\ninterest in Russia. He wrote to the Soviet Embassy in Washington for\r\ninformation on how to subscribe to Russian periodicals and for “any\r\nperiodicals or bulletins which you may put out for the benefit of your\r\ncitizens living, for a time, in the U.S.A.”[A13-983] He subsequently\r\nsubscribed to several Russian journals.[A13-984] In December 1962,\r\nthe Soviet Embassy received a card in Russian, signed “Marina and Lee\r\nOswald,” which conveyed New Year’s greetings and wishes for “health,\r\nsuccess and all of the best” to the employees at the Embassy.[A13-985]\r\nThe Oswalds continued to correspond with acquaintances in\r\nRussia.[A13-986]\r\n\r\nSoon after his return to this country, Oswald had started to correspond\r\nwith the Communist Party, U.S.A., and the Socialist Workers Party.\r\nHe subscribed to the Worker in August 1962.[A13-987] He wrote for\r\nadditional literature from these organizations, and attempted to\r\njoin the Socialist Workers Party, which, however, had no branch in\r\nTexas.[A13-988] He sent samples of his photographic work to the\r\nSocialist Workers Party, the Worker, and the Hall-Davis Defense\r\nCommittee, and offered to aid them in printing and photographic work in\r\nconnection with posters; these offers were not accepted.[A13-989]\r\n\r\nHe continued to read a great deal on a variety of subjects.[A13-990]\r\nGeorge Bouhe testified that Oswald’s fare consisted of books by Marx,\r\nLenin, “and similar things.”[A13-991] Marina said that he read books\r\nof a historical nature, including H. G. Wells’ two volume “Outline of\r\nHistory,” and biographies of Hitler, Kennedy, and Khrushchev.[A13-992]\r\n\r\nDespite the Oswalds’ break with the Russian community, De\r\nMohrenschildt, knowing that they would be alone during the Christmas\r\nseason, asked the Fords whether he could bring the Oswalds to a party\r\ncelebrating the Russian Christmas at the Fords’ home; the Fords\r\nassented. The party was attended by many members of the Russian\r\ncommunity.[A13-993] Oswald spoke at length with Yaeko Okui, a Japanese\r\nwoman who had been brought to the party by Lev Aronson, first\r\ncellist of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra;[A13-994] she told Federal\r\ninvestigators that she never saw Oswald again.[A13-995] The Oswalds\r\nwere not invited to three other Russian Christmas season gatherings\r\nwhich occurred during the next few days.[A13-996]\r\n\r\nMarina visited the De Mohrenschildts several times after\r\nChristmas.[A13-997] They invited both Lee and Marina to a small\r\ndinner party in February 1963; also present were Everett Glover, a\r\nchemist employed in Dallas, and his roommate Volkmar Schmidt.[A13-998]\r\nOn February 22, Glover had a gathering at his house, one of the\r\npurposes of which was to permit his friends, many of whom were\r\nstudying Russian, to meet the Oswalds.[A13-999] They were the objects\r\nof much attention.[A13-1000] Marina conversed at length with another\r\nguest named Ruth Paine, who had recently separated from her husband,\r\nMichael Paine, a research engineer at the Bell Helicopter plant in\r\nFort Worth. Mrs. Paine, who was studying Russian, obtained Marina’s\r\naddress[A13-1001] and shortly thereafter wrote Marina asking to see\r\nher. Marina responded by inviting Mrs. Paine to visit her.[A13-1002]\r\n\r\nThe Oswalds moved out of their Elsbeth Street apartment on March 3,\r\n1963, to an upstairs apartment several blocks away at 214 West Neely\r\nStreet. Oswald inquired about the apartment in response to a “For Rent”\r\nsign; the rent was $60 per month, not including utilities,[A13-1003]\r\nThey moved without assistance, carrying their belongings in their hands\r\nand in a baby stroller.[A13-1004] Marina preferred the Neely Street\r\napartment because it had a porch and was, she felt, more suitable for\r\nJune.[A13-1005]\r\n\r\nAware of Oswald’s difficulties in obtaining employment, George Bouhe\r\nhad advised him as early as October 1962 to attend a night school in\r\nDallas.[A13-1006] On January 14, Oswald enrolled in a typing course\r\nin the night school of Crozier Technical High School, and started\r\nattending on January 28. The class ran from 6:15 to 7:15 p.m. on\r\nMondays, Tuesday, and Thursdays. Although Oswald reviewed a typing\r\ntextbook at home, he attended the course irregularly and stopped going\r\naltogether on about March 28.[A13-1007]\r\n\r\nRuth Paine and Marina started to exchange visits in March. Mrs. Paine\r\ninvited the Oswalds for dinner, and on April 20 she took them on a\r\npicnic. When Oswald was not present, the two women frequently discussed\r\ntheir respective marital problems, and Marina disclosed to Mrs. Paine\r\nthat she was pregnant.[A13-1008] Marina wrote of these meetings:\r\n\r\n    One day we were invited to a friend’s house, where I met Ruth\r\n    Paine, who was studying Russian here in America and wanted to\r\n    improve her conversational knowledge. We began to see each\r\n    other. Ruth would come to see me with her children. This was\r\n    very good for both me and for June. She was growing up alone\r\n    and becoming terribly wild, so the company of other children\r\n    was good for her. Sometimes we went out on picnics at a nearby\r\n    lake. Lee loved to fish, and we would look and rejoice if he\r\n    caught a little fish. Several times we went to visit Ruth who\r\n    lived in Irving.[A13-1009]\r\n\r\nUsing the name of A. J. Hidell, Oswald had ordered a Smith & Wesson\r\n.38 revolver from Los Angeles on a form which he dated January 27. On\r\nMarch 12, he ordered a rifle from Klein’s Sporting Goods in Chicago\r\nunder the name of A. Hidell.[A13-1010] Oswald used the name “Alek\r\nJames Hidell” on identification cards which he probably produced at\r\nJaggars-Chiles-Stovall. One of his fellow employees taught him various\r\nphotographic techniques, which he could have used to prepare not only\r\nthese cards, but also the samples of his work which he sent to various\r\norganizations.[A13-1011]\r\n\r\nBoth weapons were shipped on March 20.[A13-1012] Oswald kept the rifle\r\nin a small storeroom at the Neely Street apartment. He spent long\r\nperiods of time in the storeroom, which he told Marina she was not to\r\nenter.[A13-1013] He told her that he intended to use the rifle for\r\nhunting[A13-1014] and that he practiced with it. She saw him leave with\r\nit once, and clean it several times.[A13-1015] He also posed for two\r\npictures, taken by Marina in the backyard of the Neely apartment, in\r\nwhich he held his rifle and copies of the Worker and the Militant and\r\nthe revolver was strapped to his belt. He gave one of the pictures to\r\nhis wife and asked her to keep it for June.[A13-1016]\r\n\r\nOver the weekend of March 9-10, Oswald photographed the alley which\r\nruns behind the home of Gen. Edwin Walker, and probably at about the\r\nsame time he photographed the rear of Walker’s home and a nearby\r\nrailroad track and right-of-way.[A13-1017] He prepared and studied a\r\nnotebook in which he outlined a plan to shoot General Walker, and he\r\nlooked at bus schedules.[A13-1018] He went to the Walker residence on\r\nthe evening of April 6 or 7, planning to make his attack. However,\r\nhe changed his plans, hid his rifle nearby, and determined to act on\r\nthe following Wednesday, April 10, when a nearby church was planning\r\na meeting which, Oswald reasoned, would create a diversion that would\r\nhelp him escape.[A13-1019] On Wednesday, Oswald left a note for Marina\r\ntelling her what to do if he were apprehended. He retrieved his rifle\r\nand fired at Walker, but the bullet narrowly missed Walker’s head.\r\nOswald secreted his rifle again and took the bus home.[A13-1020]\r\n\r\nWhen Oswald told Marina what he had done, she became angry and made\r\nhim promise never to repeat such an act. She testified that she kept\r\nhis letter, intending to give it to the authorities if he repeated\r\nhis attempt. He told Marina that he was sorry he had missed Walker\r\nand said that the shooting of Walker would have been analogous to\r\nan assassination of Hitler.[A13-1021] Several days later, the De\r\nMohrenschildts visited the Oswalds, bringing an Easter present for\r\nJune. During the visit, Jeanne De Mohrenschildt saw the rifle and\r\ntold her husband about it. Without any knowledge of the truth,\r\nDe Mohrenschildt jokingly intimated that Oswald was the one who\r\nhad shot at Walker. Oswald apparently concluded that Marina had\r\ntold De Mohrenschildt of his role in the attempt and was visibly\r\nshaken.[A13-1022]\r\n\r\nOn April 6, Oswald was dropped by Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall because,\r\nin his supervisor’s opinion, he could not do the work, although\r\nhe was trying; in addition, he did not get along with his fellow\r\nemployees.[A13-1023] The fact that he brought a Russian newspaper\r\nto work may also have been of some significance.[A13-1024] Marina\r\ntestified that her husband, who had always worried about his job\r\nsecurity at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall,[A13-1025] was quite upset by the\r\nloss of his job since he had liked the work.[A13-1026]\r\n\r\nOswald again resorted to the Texas Employment Commission.[A13-1027]\r\nOn April 8, he informed the Commission that he was seeking employment\r\nbut was referred to no employers. He stated that he had been laid off\r\nat Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall due to lack of work.[A13-1028] On April\r\n12, he made a claim for unemployment benefits; 4 days later the\r\ncommission mailed him a determination disapproving his claim because of\r\ninsufficient wage credits.[A13-1029]\r\n\r\nFor a while after the Oswalds moved into the Neely Street\r\napartment they got along well,[A13-1030] but they soon began to\r\nquarrel.[A13-1031] Oswald was apparently still preventing Marina from\r\nlearning English,[A13-1032] and there is some indication that he\r\ncontinued to beat her.[A13-1033] Since February, he had been urging\r\nher to return to Russia.[A13-1034] Marina wrote several letters to the\r\nRussian Embassy requesting a visa to return to Russia;[A13-1035] she\r\ntestified, however, that Oswald forced her to write them, and that she\r\nnever wanted to return to Russia.[A13-1036]\r\n\r\nWhen Ruth Paine visited the Oswalds at their apartment on April 24,\r\nshe was surprised to learn that Oswald was packed and ready to leave\r\nfor New Orleans by bus. He explained that he had been unable to find\r\nemployment in or around Dallas, and that Marina had suggested that\r\nhe go to New Orleans since he had been born there.[A13-1037] Marina\r\nhas testified that the real reason behind her suggestion was that she\r\nwanted to get him out of town because of the Walker incident.[A13-1038]\r\nMrs. Paine offered to drive Marina to New Orleans at a later date, and\r\nalso to have Marina and June stay with her rather than at the apartment\r\nin the meantime. Oswald helped the women pack Mrs. Paine’s car, and the\r\ntwo women moved everything from the Neely Street apartment to the Paine\r\nhouse in Irving.[A13-1039]\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at the bus station in New Orleans, Oswald telephoned\r\nhis aunt, Lillian Murret, to ask if he could stay at her home at 757\r\nFrench Street while he looked for employment. She had been unaware that\r\nhe had returned from Russia or that he was married and had a child\r\nand was surprised to hear from him. She said that she did not have\r\nroom to accommodate three guests, but that since he was alone he was\r\nwelcome.[A13-1040]\r\n\r\nOswald had been born in New Orleans, and on his return showed great\r\ninterest in finding out what had happened to the other members of his\r\nfather’s family. He visited the cemetery where his father was buried\r\nand called all the Oswalds in the telephone book. By this method he\r\nlocated one relative, Mrs. Hazel Oswald of Metairie, La., the widow of\r\nWilliam Stout Oswald, his father’s brother. He visited her at her home;\r\nshe gave him a picture of his father and told him that as far as she\r\nknew the rest of the family was dead.[A13-1041]\r\n\r\nOn April 26, Oswald began his search for employment. He went to the\r\nemployment office of the Louisiana Department of Labor and stated that\r\nhe was qualified as a commercial photographer, shipping clerk, or\r\n“darkroom man.” The interviewer noted on Oswald’s application card:\r\n“Will travel on limited basis. Will relocate. Min. $1.25 hr. Neat.\r\nSuit. Tie. Polite.”[A13-1042] Although the employment commission made a\r\nfew referrals, Oswald relied primarily upon newspaper advertisements,\r\nand applied for a number of positions.[A13-1043] Mrs. Murret testified\r\nthat he would spend the day job hunting, return to her home for supper,\r\nwatch television, and go to bed.[A13-1044]\r\n\r\nOn April 29, he filed a request for reconsideration of the employment\r\ncommission’s disapproval of his unemployment compensation claim.\r\nHis complaint that he had not been credited for his employment at\r\nJaggars-Chiles-Stovall was ruled valid on May 8, and he was granted\r\nmaximum benefits of $369, payable at the rate of $33 per week. He filed\r\ninterstate claims on May 7 and 15, and received $33 in response to\r\nthe latter; the former claim was filed before the expiration of the\r\nprescribed waiting period.[A13-1045] Not only had Oswald in fact been\r\nworking since May 10, but he included on his claim sheet, as concerns\r\nwith which he had sought work, fictitious employers and employers whom\r\nhe apparently had not contacted.[A13-1046]\r\n\r\nOswald wrote to Marina: “All is well. I am living with Aunt Lillian.\r\nShe has very kindly taken us in. I am now looking for work. When I find\r\nit I will write you.”[A13-1047] And on May 3, he wrote to Marina and\r\nRuth Paine: “Girls, I still have not found work, but I receive money\r\nfrom the unemployment office in the amount 15 to 20 dollars. They were\r\nmistaken in the Dallas office when they refused, but I straightened\r\neverything out. Uncle ‘Dyuz’ offered me a loan of $200.00 if needed.\r\nGreat, eh?!”[A13-1048]\r\n\r\nOn May 9, responding to a newspaper advertisement, Oswald completed\r\nan application for employment with William B. Reily Co., Inc., at 640\r\nMagazine Street, an enterprise engaged in the roasting, grinding,\r\ncanning, bagging, and sale of coffee. On his application form, Oswald\r\nlisted as references in addition to John Murret, “Sgt. Robert Hidell”\r\nand “Lieut. J. Evans,” both apparently fictitious names.[A13-1049]\r\nHis application was approved and he began work on May 10, at the rate\r\nof $1.50 per hour. His task was the lubrication of the company’s\r\nmachinery.[A13-1050] Oswald did not enjoy this work,[A13-1051] and\r\ntold his wife and Mrs. Paine that he was working in commercial\r\nphotography.[A13-1052]\r\n\r\nAlso on May 9, Oswald obtained an apartment at 4905 Magazine Street\r\nwith the help of Myrtle Evans, who had known him when he was a child.\r\nThe rent was $65 a month. Oswald moved in on May 10,[A13-1053] after\r\ntelephoning Marina on the ninth and asking her to come to New Orleans.\r\nRuth Paine testified that the invitation elated Marina: “Papa nas\r\nlubet”--“Daddy loves us,” she repeated again and again. Mrs. Paine\r\ndrove Marina and June to New Orleans; they left Dallas on May 10, spent\r\nthe night in Shreveport, and arrived on the 11th. Mrs. Paine stayed\r\nwith the Oswalds for 3 days; the three of them, with June and Mrs.\r\nPaine’s children, toured the French Quarter. On May 14, Mrs. Paine left\r\nNew Orleans to return to her home.[A13-1054]\r\n\r\nThe Murrets and the Oswalds exchanged visits from time to time; Marina\r\ntestified that the Murrets were very good to them.[A13-1055] Mrs.\r\nMurret’s daughter, Marilyn, took the Oswalds on an outing.[A13-1056]\r\nBut, according to Marina’s testimony, aside from Ruth Paine and Ruth\r\nKloepfer and her daughters, the Murrets were the only social visitors\r\nthe Oswalds had.[A13-1057] Ruth Kloepfer was a clerk of the Quaker\r\nMeeting in New Orleans whom Ruth Paine had written in the hope that she\r\nmight know some Russian-speaking people who could visit Marina. Mrs.\r\nKloepfer herself visited the Oswalds but made no attempt to direct any\r\nRussian-speaking people to them.[A13-1058]\r\n\r\nOn July 19, Oswald was dismissed by Reily because of inefficiency\r\nand inattention to his work. He had spent many of his working hours\r\nnext door at the Crescent City Garage, where he read gun magazines\r\nand discussed guns with one of the owners, Adrian Alba.[A13-1059] On\r\nthe following Monday, July 22, Oswald again visited the Louisiana\r\nemployment office to seek new employment and file a claim for\r\nunemployment compensation. Thereafter, he collected unemployment\r\ncompensation weekly and, although apparently making some effort\r\nto obtain another job, again listed a number of fictitious job\r\napplications on his unemployment compensation claim forms.[A13-1060] He\r\nsoon gave up his search for employment, and began to spend his days at\r\nhome reading.[A13-1061] He received another setback on July 25, when he\r\nwas notified that in response to the request for review which he had\r\nmade in 1962, his undesirable discharge from the Marine Corps had been\r\naffirmed.[A13-1062]\r\n\r\nDuring this period, Oswald began to evidence thoughts of returning to\r\nthe Soviet Union or going to Cuba. On June 24 he applied for a new\r\npassport, which he received on the following day.[A13-1063] Apparently\r\nat Oswald’s request,[A13-1064] Marina wrote to the Russian Embassy,\r\nexpressing a desire to return to Russia and indicating that she would\r\nbe accompanied by her husband. She explained that she wanted to return\r\nbecause of family problems, including the impending birth of her\r\nsecond child.[A13-1065] Accompanying her letter was a letter written\r\nby Oswald dated July 1, in which he asked the Embassy to rush an\r\nentrance visa for his wife and requested that his visa be considered\r\nseparately.[A13-1066] Marina believed that Oswald was really planning\r\nto go only to Cuba.[A13-1067] She testified that “his basic desire was\r\nto get to Cuba by any means, and that all the rest of it was window\r\ndressing for that purpose.”[A13-1068]\r\n\r\nDuring the early days of the New Orleans period, the Oswalds’ marriage\r\nwas more harmonious than it had been previously. Marina wrote:\r\n\r\n    * * * our family life in New Orleans was more peaceful. Lee\r\n    took great satisfaction in showing me the city where he was\r\n    born. We often went to the beach, the zoo, and the park. Lee\r\n    liked to go and hunt crabs. It is true, that he was not very\r\n    pleased with his job * * * We did not have very much money, and\r\n    the birth of a new child involved new expenses * * * As before,\r\n    Lee spent a great deal of time reading.[A13-1069]\r\n\r\nMarina testified, however, that after they had been in New Orleans for\r\na while, Oswald became depressed and that she once found him alone in\r\nthe dark crying.[A13-1070] She wrote to Ruth Paine that his “love” had\r\nceased soon after Mrs. Paine had left New Orleans.[A13-1071] Mrs. Paine\r\ntestified, however, that she had noticed friction between the Oswalds\r\nbefore she left.[A13-1072] On July 11, Mrs. Paine wrote Marina that\r\nif Oswald did not wish to live with her any more and preferred that\r\nshe return to the Soviet Union, she could live at the Paines’ house.\r\nAlthough Mrs. Paine had long entertained this idea, this was the first\r\ntime she explicitly made the invitation. She renewed the invitation on\r\nJuly 12, and again on July 14; she attempted to overcome any feeling\r\nwhich Marina might have that she would be a burden by stating that\r\nMarina could help with the housework and help her learn Russian, and\r\nthat she would also provide a tax advantage.[A13-1073]\r\n\r\nMarina replied that she had previously raised the subject of a\r\nseparation and that it had led to arguments. She stated that she was\r\nhappy and that for a considerable period of time Oswald had been good\r\nto her. She attributed this improved attitude to the fact that he\r\nwas anticipating their second child. Marina turned down Mrs. Paine’s\r\ninvitation but said that she would take advantage of it if things\r\nbecame worse.[A13-1074] Mrs. Paine replied that she was taking a trip\r\nnorth to visit her parents and would visit Marina in New Orleans about\r\nSeptember 18. She also suggested that Marina come to her house for the\r\nbirth of the baby.[A13-1075]\r\n\r\nOn July 6, Eugene Murret, a cousin of Oswald who was studying to be a\r\nJesuit Priest in Mobile, Ala., wrote and asked if Oswald could come to\r\nMobile and speak at the Jesuit House of Studies about “contemporary\r\nRussia and the practice of Communism there.” Oswald accepted, and on\r\nJuly 27 he and his family, joined by some of the Murrets, traveled to\r\nMobile; Charles Murret paid the expenses. Oswald spoke concerning his\r\nobservations in Russia and conducted a question and answer period; he\r\nimpressed his listeners as articulate. He indicated that he had become\r\ndisillusioned during his stay in Russia, and that in his opinion the\r\nbest political system would be one which combined the best points of\r\ncapitalism and communism.[A13-1076] While he left his listeners with\r\nthe impression that he was an atheist, he avoided a direct discussion\r\nof religion. The group returned to New Orleans on July 28.[A13-1077]\r\n\r\nIn late May and early June, Oswald had apparently begun to formulate\r\nplans for creating a New Orleans branch of the Fair Play for Cuba\r\nCommittee. Using the name “Lee Osborne” he ordered a number of printed\r\ncirculars demanding “Hands off Cuba” in large letters, and application\r\nforms and membership cards for the proposed chapter.[A13-1078] On\r\nAugust 5, he visited a store managed by Carlos Bringuier, a Cuban\r\nrefugee and avid opponent of Castro and the New Orleans delegate of the\r\nCuban student directorate. Oswald indicated an interest in joining the\r\nstruggle against Castro. He told Bringuier that he had been a marine\r\nand was trained in guerrilla warfare, and that he was willing not only\r\nto train Cubans to fight Castro but also to join the fight himself.\r\nThe next day Oswald returned to the store and left his “Guidebook for\r\nMarines” for Bringuier.[A13-1079]\r\n\r\nOn August 9, Bringuier saw Oswald passing out Fair Play for Cuba\r\nleaflets. Bringuier and his companions became angry and a dispute\r\nresulted. Oswald and the three Cuban exiles were arrested for\r\ndisturbing the peace.[A13-1080] Oswald spent the night in jail and was\r\ninterviewed the next day by a lieutenant of the New Orleans Police\r\nDepartment. At Oswald’s request, an FBI agent also interviewed him.\r\nOswald maintained that he was a member of the New Orleans branch of\r\nthe Fair Play for Cuba Committee which, he claimed, had 35 members.\r\nHe stated also that he had been in touch with the president of that\r\norganization, A. J. Hidell.[A13-1081] Oswald was in fact the only\r\nmember of the “New Orleans branch,” which had never been chartered by\r\nthe National Fair Play for Cuba Committee.[A13-1082] Later that day\r\nOswald was released on bail, and 2 days later he pleaded guilty to the\r\ncharges against him and paid a $10 fine. The charges against the Cuban\r\nexiles were dismissed.[A13-1083] Marina testified that the arrest upset\r\nLee and that he “became less active, he cooled off a little” after\r\nit.[A13-1084]\r\n\r\nOn August 16, Oswald, assisted by at least one other person who was\r\na hired helper, again passed out Fair Play for Cuba literature, this\r\ntime in front of the International Trade Mart. That night, television\r\nnewscasts ran pictures of Oswald’s activities.[A13-1085] (This\r\nhindered Oswald’s subsequent attempts to obtain employment in New\r\nOrleans.)[A13-1086] Bringuier sent one of his friends to Oswald’s home\r\nto pose as a Castro sympathizer and attempt to obtain information about\r\nOswald, but Oswald apparently saw through the ruse.[A13-1087]\r\n\r\nWilliam Stuckey, a radio broadcaster with a program called “Latin\r\nListening Post,” had long been looking for a member of the Fair Play\r\nfor Cuba Committee to appear on his program. He learned about Oswald\r\nfrom Bringuier, and visited Oswald on August 17. Later that day,\r\nStuckey recorded an interview with Oswald which was cut to about 5\r\nminutes and played back on the show that evening.[A13-1088] Two days\r\nlater, Stuckey asked the news director of the station if he could run\r\nthe entire tape, but the director felt that a debate with a local\r\nopponent of Castro would be of greater public interest. Consequently,\r\nStuckey arranged for a debate between Oswald and Bringuier on a\r\n25-minute daily public affairs program called “Conversation Carte\r\nBlanche,” which took place on August 21.[A13-1089] Oswald defended\r\nthe Castro regime and discussed Marxism. He was put on the defensive\r\nwhen his defection to Russia was brought up,[A13-1090] and Stuckey\r\nlater testified that he thought that the program had finished the Fair\r\nPlay for Cuba Committee in New Orleans.[A13-1091] However, Stuckey\r\nalso testified that Oswald seemed to be a clean-cut and intelligent\r\nperson who conducted himself very well during the interviews and\r\ndebates.[A13-1092]\r\n\r\nOswald wrote several times to V. T. Lee, then national director of the\r\nFair Play for Cuba Committee, telling him, sometimes in exaggerated\r\nterms, of his activities.[A13-1093] He wrote also to the Communist\r\nParty and asked whether, in view of his prior defection, he should\r\n“continue to fight, handicapped as it were, by * * * [his] past record,\r\n[and] compete with anti-progressive forces, above-ground or * * *\r\nshould always remain in the background, i.e., underground.” [A13-1094]\r\nThe Party replied that “often it is advisable for some people to remain\r\nin the background, not underground.” [A13-1095] And although Oswald\r\nwrote four letters to V. T. Lee during the summer,[A13-1096] there is\r\nno evidence that Oswald heard from him after May 29.\r\n\r\nRuth Paine arrived in New Orleans on September 20, and spent three\r\nnights with the Oswalds. During this stay, Mrs. Paine found relations\r\nbetween them much improved. Nonetheless, it was decided that Marina\r\nwould go back with her to Irving for the birth of the baby. Marina and\r\nMrs. Paine toured Bourbon Street while Oswald stayed home and did some\r\npacking for Marina’s return to Texas.[A13-1097] On Sunday, September\r\n22, Oswald and Mrs. Paine finished loading the station wagon with the\r\nOswalds’ household belongings.[A13-1098]\r\n\r\n\r\nMEXICO CITY\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald testified that sometime in August her husband first\r\ntold her of his plan to go to Mexico and from there to Cuba, where he\r\nplanned to stay; he had given up a plan to hijack an airplane and fly\r\ndirectly to Cuba, which plan Marina consistently opposed.[A13-1099]\r\nOn September 17, he obtained from the Mexican consulate general in\r\nNew Orleans a “Tourist Card,” FM-8 No. 24085, good for one journey\r\ninto Mexico for no longer than 15 days. Typed in the blank, “Appelidos\r\ny nombre,” was “Lee, Harvey Oswald,” “Fotogrofo”; the intended\r\ndestination was shown as Mexico City.[A13-1100] (The comma between\r\n“Lee” and “Harvey” seems to have been an error.)[A13-1101] On the\r\napplication Oswald stated that he was employed at “640 Rampart”; he was\r\nin fact unemployed.[A13-1102] (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 2478, 2481,\r\np. 300.)\r\n\r\nMarina and June departed with Mrs. Ruth Paine for Irving on the morning\r\nof September 23.[A13-1103] Before she left, Oswald told Marina that she\r\nshould not tell anyone about his impending trip to Mexico.[A13-1104]\r\nMarina kept this secret until after the assassination.[A13-1105] On the\r\nprevious day, Oswald’s landlord had seen Mrs. Paine’s car being packed\r\nand had asked Oswald, whose rent was about 15 days overdue, whether\r\nhe was leaving. Oswald told him that Marina was leaving temporarily\r\nbut that he would remain.[A13-1106] A neighbor testified that on\r\nthe evening of September 24, he saw Oswald, carrying two pieces of\r\nluggage, hurriedly leave the Magazine Street apartment and board a\r\nbus.[A13-1107] Though uncertain of the exact date, a city busdriver\r\nrecalls that at the same time of day and at the same location he picked\r\nup a man who was carrying two suitcases of different sizes and helped\r\nhim place them so that they would not disturb the other passengers. The\r\ndriver remembers that the man asked directions to the Greyhound bus\r\nstation. He discharged the passenger at an intersection where he could\r\nboard a Canal Street car and transfer to another bus which would go\r\npast the Greyhound and Continental Trailways stations.[A13-1108] The\r\nlandlord found Oswald’s apartment vacant on September 25.[A13-1109]\r\n\r\nOswald appears to have taken with him a Spanish-English\r\ndictionary;[A13-1110] his address book;[A13-1111] his 1963 passport\r\nand old passport;[A13-1112] his correspondence with the Communist\r\nParty and with the Soviet Embassy in Washington, some of which was in\r\nRussian;[A13-1113] proof of his marriage;[A13-1114] newspaper clippings\r\nconcerning his arrest and his interest in the activities of the Fair\r\nPlay for Cuba Committee[A13-1115] (activities which, Marina testified,\r\nhe had undertaken because he thought that they would help him when he\r\ngot to Cuba);[A13-1116] evidence that he was the “Director” of the New\r\nOrleans chapter of the Committee;[A13-1117] and various other cards,\r\nsuch as a work card, which he had obtained in Russia.[A13-1118] He took\r\nalso several sheets of notepaper on which he had written a summary of\r\nimportant events in his life which he presumably intended to call to\r\nthe attention of Cuban and Soviet officials in Mexico City to convince\r\nthem to let him enter Cuba. On these sheets he had recorded facts\r\nabout his Marine service, including the dates of his enlistment and\r\ndischarge, the places where he had served, and the diplomas that he\r\nhad received from military school. Recorded also were notes on his\r\nstay in the Soviet Union, his early interest in Communist literature,\r\nhis ability to speak Russian, his organization of the New Orleans\r\nchapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, his contact with police\r\nauthorities in connection with his work for the Committee, and his\r\nexperience in “street agitation,” as a “radio speaker and lecturer,”\r\nand as a photographer.[A13-1119] The two pieces of luggage which\r\nOswald took with him were a small, blue, zipper bag[A13-1120] and a\r\nlarge, olive-colored bag,[A13-1121] both made of cloth. He carried\r\nthe smaller bag with him throughout the trip, but, at least from\r\nNuevo Laredo to Mexico City, checked the larger one through to his\r\ndestination.[A13-1122]\r\n\r\nOswald remained in New Orleans until September 25. His precise\r\nwhereabouts on the night of September 24 are uncertain, but in view\r\nof his limited finances, he probably returned to the apartment to\r\nsleep after checking his luggage at a bus station or spent the night\r\nat an inexpensive hotel or roominghouse. Some time after 5 a.m. on\r\nSeptember 25, he collected a Texas unemployment compensation check for\r\n$33 at his New Orleans post office box. He cashed the check between\r\n8 a.m. and noon at a store about six blocks from his apartment on\r\nMagazine Street.[A13-1123] This gave him about $200 for the trip to\r\nMexico.[A13-1124]\r\n\r\nHe left New Orleans by bus,[A13-1125] probably on Continental Trailways\r\nBus No. 5121, departing New Orleans at 12:20 p.m. on September 25, and\r\nscheduled to arrive in Houston at 10:50 p.m.; that bus is the only one\r\non which Oswald could have left New Orleans after noon on September\r\n25[A13-1126] and arrived in Houston before midnight.[A13-1127] Sometime\r\nin the evening he called the home of Horace Elroy Twiford, a member\r\nof the Socialist Labor Party who had received Oswald’s name from the\r\nparty’s headquarters in New York and sent him a copy of its official\r\npublication, the “Weekly People.”[A13-1128] Mrs. Twiford, who answered\r\nthe telephone,[A13-1129] believes that the call was made locally,\r\nbefore 10 p.m. It may have been made from Beaumont or some other\r\nstop on the route; however, in view of the bus schedule, it probably\r\nwas made in Houston later than Mrs. Twiford remembered.[A13-1130]\r\nOswald told Mrs. Twiford that he was a member of the Fair Play for\r\nCuba Committee and that he hoped to see her husband for a few hours\r\nthat evening before he flew to Mexico. He wanted also to find out how\r\nTwiford had obtained his name and address. Mrs. Twiford told Oswald\r\nthat her husband, a merchant seaman, was at sea but would be happy to\r\nsee him at some other time; she offered to take a message. Oswald said\r\nthat he could not await her husband’s return because he was flying\r\nto Mexico.[A13-1131] The Twifords have stated that they had no other\r\ncontact with Oswald.[A13-1132]\r\n\r\nAn employee of the U.S. Selective Service System has stated that an\r\nindividual calling himself “Harvey Oswald” appeared at her office in\r\nAustin, Tex., immediately after lunch on September 25, and discussed\r\nwith her the possibility of rectifying his undesirable discharge from\r\nthe Marine Corps.[A13-1133] Despite the employee’s reputability and\r\napparent sincerity, all of the information which she furnished with\r\nrespect to Oswald’s appearance and conversation could have been derived\r\nfrom news media, consciously or unconsciously, by the time she told the\r\nFBI her story. Other persons in Austin who, according to the employee’s\r\ntestimony, should also have observed Oswald failed to corroborate her\r\ntestimony.[A13-1134] No other evidence tending to show that Oswald was\r\nin Austin at this time has been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe telephone call which Oswald made to the Twifords on the evening of\r\nSeptember 25, indicates that he was either in Houston or on his way\r\nthere when he made it, since the purpose of the call was to make an\r\nappointment to see Twiford in Houston that evening. Oswald could not\r\nhave left New Orleans on September 25, been in Austin 521 miles away\r\nby early afternoon, and returned 162 miles to Houston by night unless\r\nhe traveled by air; airline records contain no indication that Oswald\r\nwas on such flights.[A13-1135] It is very unlikely that he had with\r\nhim enough money beyond what he needed for the trip to Mexico City to\r\ntake such flights, and the poor state of his finances at this time\r\nplus his well-established frugality make it extremely unlikely that he\r\nwould have considered it worthwhile to do so even if he could. There\r\nis no evidence that Oswald was in such a hurry to reach Mexico that he\r\nwould have felt it necessary to travel by airplane rather than a less\r\nexpensive means of travel. He took a bus from Houston to Mexico City,\r\nlived very inexpensively there, and took a bus back to Dallas; there is\r\nno apparent reason why he would have interrupted such an inexpensive\r\ntrip to fly to Austin and then to Houston. He told a passenger whom he\r\nmet on the next leg of his trip that he had come from New Orleans, and\r\nmade no reference to Austin.[A13-1136]\r\n\r\nOn September 26, Oswald boarded Continental Trailways bus No. 5133\r\nin Houston and departed at 2:35 a.m. for Laredo, Tex., via Corpus\r\nChristi and Alice.[A13-1137] Two British tourists, Dr. and Mrs. John B.\r\nMcFarland, who boarded No. 5133 in Houston, noticed Oswald when they\r\nawoke at about 6 a.m. Oswald told them that he was going to Cuba via\r\nMexico City, and they inferred from conversation with him that he had\r\nleft New Orleans early in the afternoon of September 25 and that he was\r\ngoing to Cuba via Mexico City. He said also that he was secretary of\r\nthe New Orleans branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and that he\r\nhoped to see Fidel Castro in Cuba. The bus was scheduled to arrive in\r\nLaredo at approximately 1:20 p.m.[A13-1138]\r\n\r\nOswald crossed the border from Laredo to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, between\r\n1:30 and 2 p.m.[A13-1139] From Nuevo Laredo, he traveled to Mexico City\r\naboard bus No. 516 of the Flecha Roja Bus Line, which departed at 2:15\r\np.m. and was scheduled to arrive in Mexico City at 9:45 a.m. on the\r\nfollowing day; he held baggage claim check No. 320435.[A13-1140] He\r\nwas seen on the bus by the McFarlands and by two Australian girls who\r\nboarded the bus on the evening of September 26 at Monterrey.[A13-1141]\r\nHe occupied the seat next to an elderly Englishman, who told the girls\r\nthat the young man sitting next to him apparently had been to Mexico\r\nbefore.[A13-1142] The man next to Oswald was probably Albert Osborne,\r\na native of the British Isles who has worked as an itinerant preacher\r\nin the Southern United States and Mexico for many years. Osborne denied\r\nthat he sat beside Oswald; but in view of his inconsistent and untrue\r\nresponses to Federal investigators concerning matters not directly\r\nrelated to Oswald, the Commission believes that his denial cannot be\r\ncredited. It appeared to the other passengers on the bus that Osborne\r\nand Oswald had not previously met; extensive investigation has revealed\r\nno other contact between them.[A13-1143]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the 20-hour bus trip, Oswald initiated two\r\nconversations with the Australian girls, during which he mentioned\r\nhis visit to Russia and recommended the Hotel Cuba in Mexico City as\r\na “clean and cheap” hotel; he told them, apparently falsely, that he\r\nhad stayed there on previous occasions. He said that when he had seen\r\nthem board the bus with their heavy suitcases, he had been under the\r\nimpression that they were Mexican and had therefore asked the man next\r\nto him how to say “How can I help you?” in Spanish. From this they\r\ninferred that Oswald did not speak Spanish, an impression which is\r\nshared by every witness who met Oswald on his trip and is supported\r\nby notations which he made on documents that he carried.[A13-1144] He\r\ngot off the bus at every stop and ate large meals, always eating by\r\nhimself; the girls thought he ate so much because he could not make\r\nhimself understood in Spanish and had to order by pointing at the\r\nmenu.[A13-1145] The bus arrived in Mexico City 15 minutes late, at 10\r\na.m.[A13-1146] Oswald left the bus station by himself and had no known\r\nfurther contact with any of the people with whom he had spoken on the\r\nbus.[A13-1147]\r\n\r\nOswald registered at the Hotel del Comercio within an hour of his\r\narrival in Mexico City. He stayed there throughout his visit.[A13-1148]\r\nThe hotel, located not far from the commercial heart of the city and\r\nwithin four blocks of the bus station, is one of a group of hotels\r\nlocated near the intercity bus terminals and has perhaps the best\r\nappearance of the group.[A13-1149] It is known by personnel in other\r\nhotels that the owner of the Hotel del Comercio can understand and\r\nspeak a little English.[A13-1150] Oswald registered as “Lee, Harvey\r\nOswald,” and gave his occupation as “photo.”[A13-1151] He had room 18\r\nwhich cost $1.28 per day.[A13-1152]\r\n\r\nAfter he had registered, Oswald turned promptly to the task of\r\nobtaining permission to enter Cuba. Mexican officials would not permit\r\na U.S. citizen without a Cuban visa to board a plane for Cuba even\r\nif he had an American passport, but would permit passage if he had a\r\nvisa even though the passport proscribed travel to Cuba.[A13-1153]\r\nOswald had a 1963 American passport (stamped invalid for travel to\r\nCuba)[A13-1154] but had neither a regular Cuban visa nor an intransit\r\nvisa which would permit a short stay in Cuba on his way to Russia or\r\nsome other country. His address book contained the telephone number and\r\naddress of a Cuban airline, but there is evidence that he never visited\r\nits office.[A13-1155]\r\n\r\nHe visited the Cuban Embassy on Friday, September 27 and spoke with\r\nSenora Silvia Tirado de Duran, a Mexican citizen employed there. Senora\r\nDuran later made a signed statement to the Mexican police that Oswald:\r\n\r\n    * * * applied for a visa to Cuba in transit to Russia and based\r\n    his application on his presentation of his passport in which\r\n    it was recorded that he had been living in the latter country\r\n    for a period of three years, his work permit from that same\r\n    country written in the Russian language and letters in the same\r\n    language, as well as proof of his being married to a woman of\r\n    Russian nationality and being the apparent Director in the city\r\n    of New Orleans of the organization called “Fair Play for Cuba”\r\n    with the desire that he should be accepted as a “friend” of the\r\n    Cuban Revolution * * * [A13-1156]\r\n\r\nHe apparently also stated that he was a member of the Communist\r\nParty and displayed documents which he claimed to be evidence of\r\nhis membership.[A13-1157] He said that he intended to go to Cuba on\r\nSeptember 30 and to remain there for 2 weeks, or longer if possible,\r\nand then go on to Russia.[A13-1158] Senora Duran took down the relevant\r\ndate and filled out the appropriate application. Oswald left the\r\nEmbassy but was to return in the afternoon.[A13-1159]\r\n\r\nThen, or possibly even before his initial visit to the Cuban Embassy\r\nOswald went to the Soviet Embassy where he spoke with either Pavel\r\nAntonovich Yatskov or Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov.[A13-1160]\r\nThey are both consular officials serving also as agents of\r\nthe KGB.[A13-1161] Oswald later said that he had dealt with\r\n“Kostin,”[A13-1162] undoubtedly a reference to Kostikov. He was unable\r\nto obtain a Soviet visa then. Marina said that the officials at the\r\nSoviet Embassy “refused to have anything to do with him.”[A13-1163]\r\n\r\nOswald returned to the Cuban Embassy later that afternoon, this time\r\nbringing with him passport photographs which he may have obtained in\r\nthe United States.[A13-1164] Senora Duran telephoned the Soviet Embassy\r\nto inquire about the status of Oswald’s Russian visa and was told that\r\nthere would be a delay of about 4 months.[A13-1165] Oswald became\r\n“highly agitated and angry,” particularly when he learned that he could\r\nnot obtain an intransit visa to Cuba before he acquired a Russian visa.\r\nSenora Duran called the Cuban consul, then Eusibio Azque, to speak to\r\nhim. The discussion between Oswald and Azque developed into a heated\r\nargument, which ended when Azque told Oswald that in his opinion people\r\nlike Oswald were harming the Cuban Revolution and that so far as Azque\r\nwas concerned, he would not give Oswald a visa.[A13-1166] Senora Duran\r\nwrote her name and the phone number of the Embassy on a piece of paper\r\nwhich she gave to Oswald in case he wished to contact her again. He\r\ncopied this information into his address book.[A13-1167] Senora Duran\r\nforwarded the Cuban visa application to Havana;[A13-1168] the Cuban\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs replied on October 15 that the visa could\r\nbe issued only after Oswald had obtained a Russian visa.[A13-1169] (See\r\nCommission Exhibit No. 2564, p. 303.)\r\n\r\nOswald contacted the Russian and Cuban Embassies again during his stay\r\nin Mexico.[A13-1170] He had no greater success than he had before.\r\nMarina testified that when he returned to Texas, he was convinced\r\nthat his trip had been a failure and disappointed at having been\r\nunable to go to Cuba.[A13-1171] A month later, in a painstakingly\r\ncomposed[A13-1172] letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, Oswald\r\nascribed his failure to “a gross breach of regulations” on the part of\r\nthe Cuban Embassy. “Of corse,” he wrote, “the Soviet Embassy was not at\r\nfault, they were, as I say unprepared.”[A13-1173]\r\n\r\nThe hotel maid said that Oswald generally was gone by the time she\r\narrived at 9 a.m. The night watchman said he usually returned at about\r\nmidnight,[A13-1174] which is not unusual, in view of the late hour at\r\nwhich Mexico City’s evening activities begin. He ate several lunches\r\nat a small restaurant immediately adjacent to the hotel, coming to the\r\nrestaurant shortly after 2 p.m., and ordering food by pointing to the\r\nmenu, apparently with some consideration of cost; he spent between\r\n40 and 48 cents for each meal. He ate the soup of the day, rice, and\r\neither meat or eggs, but refused dessert and coffee; the waitress\r\nconcluded that Oswald did not realize that the items which he refused\r\nwere included in the price of the lunch.[A13-1175] He was seen with\r\nno other person either at his hotel or at the restaurant.[A13-1176] A\r\nhotel guest stated that on one occasion he sat down at a table with\r\nOswald because there was no empty table in the restaurant, but that\r\nneither spoke to the other because of the language barrier.[A13-1177]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Soviet and Cuban Embassies are within two blocks of\r\neach other, they are some distance from Oswald’s hotel.[A13-1178] He\r\nmust, therefore, have traversed a substantial portion of the city on\r\nmore than one occasion. Marina testified that he told her that he\r\nhad seen a bullfight,[A13-1179] which would normally have been on\r\nSunday afternoon, and that he had visited museums[A13-1180] and done\r\nsome sightseeing.[A13-1181] He apparently also saw one or more motion\r\npictures, either American with Spanish subtitles or Mexican with\r\nEnglish subtitles.[A13-1182] From notations in his Spanish-English\r\ndictionary and on his guide map of Mexico City, it appears that Oswald\r\nintended to attend a jai alai game[A13-1183] but he almost certainly\r\ndid not do so.[A13-1184]\r\n\r\nHe purchased several postcards depicting bullfights and tourist\r\nattractions, which he brought back to Marina.[A13-1185] She had told\r\nhim before he left that she would like Mexican silver bracelets as\r\na souvenir, and he brought her a silver bracelet inscribed with her\r\nname.[A13-1186] Marina suspected, almost certainly correctly, that\r\nthe bracelet, of Japanese origin, did not come from Mexico.[A13-1187]\r\nNo such jewelry is known to be sold in or around Mexico City, because\r\nof a high duty[A13-1188] but the bracelet is of a type commonly sold\r\nin 5-and-10-cent stores in Dallas.[A13-1189] Oswald did not buy the\r\nMexican phonograph records which Marina had requested, despite the\r\nnotation, “records,” which he had placed in his dictionary.[A13-1190]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, September 30, Oswald began to prepare for his return to\r\nthe United States. He appeared at the Agencia de Viages, Transportes\r\nChihuahuenses,[A13-1191] and purchased international exchange orders\r\ncosting $20.30 for travel on a Transportes del Norte bus from Mexico\r\nCity to Laredo and by Greyhound bus directly from Laredo to Dallas. The\r\ntravel agency made a reservation for him on Transportes del Norte bus\r\nNo. 332, departing Mexico City at 8:30 a.m. on October 2. The seat,\r\nNo. 12, was reserved in the name of the travel agency, which recorded\r\nthe reservation in the name of “H. O. Lee.”[A13-1192] The employee who\r\nmade the reservation testified that he probably wrote the name that way\r\nbecause he was copying from Oswald’s tourist card, which read “Lee,\r\nHarvey Oswald.”[A13-1193] (The manifest for Transportes Frontera bus\r\nNo. 340, leaving Mexico City for Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo at 1 p.m.\r\non Wednesday, October 2, 1963, contains the name “Oswld” [sic], which\r\napparently was added to the manifest after the trip;[A13-1194] in any\r\nevent, Oswald did not take bus 340.)[A13-1195]\r\n\r\nOn October 1, Oswald paid his hotel bill through that night.[A13-1196]\r\nThe hotel night watchman remembers helping Oswald obtain a taxicab at\r\nabout 6:30 or 7 on the following morning.[A13-1197] Transportes del\r\nNorte bus No. 332 left as scheduled at about 8:30 a.m.; at Monterrey\r\nthe passengers were shifted to a relief bus, No. 373, scheduled to\r\ndepart for Laredo at 10 p.m. that evening.[A13-1198] Fellow passengers\r\nrecall that Oswald was pulled off the bus by Mexican officials at the\r\nborder, because of some alleged irregularity in his Mexican tourist\r\npapers; one passenger overheard him mumbling complaints about the\r\nMexican immigration officials when he returned to the bus.[A13-1199]\r\nThey remember also that Oswald was hurriedly “gulping” down a banana\r\nafter the bus reached customs, perhaps because he believed that\r\nhe could not take fruit into the United States.[A13-1200] (Marina\r\nhas testified that her husband liked bananas and frequently ate\r\nthem.)[A13-1201] One of the passengers testified that Oswald annoyed\r\nhim by keeping his overhead light on to read after 10 p.m.[A13-1202]\r\nHe may have conversed with an elderly woman on the bus, but he was not\r\ntraveling with her.[A13-1203]\r\n\r\nAt about 1:35 a.m. on October 3, Oswald crossed the International\r\nBridge from Nuevo Laredo into Texas.[A13-1204] He traveled from Laredo\r\nto Dallas via San Antonio, on Greyhound bus No. 1265, substantially\r\nfollowing Interstate Route 35 for the entire trip[A13-1205] leaving\r\nLaredo at 3 a.m. and arriving in Dallas at about 2:20 p.m. on the same\r\nday.[A13-1206]\r\n\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n\r\nOswald did not contact his wife immediately when he returned to\r\nDallas. He went to the office of the employment commission, where he\r\nfiled an unemployment compensation claim[A13-1207] and announced that\r\nhe was again looking for work.[A13-1208] He spent the night at the\r\nYMCA, where he registered as a serviceman in order to avoid paying\r\nthe membership fee.[A13-1209] On the following day, he applied for\r\na job as a typesetter trainee at the Padgett Printing Co. He made\r\na favorable impression on the department foreman, but the plant\r\nsuperintendent called Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall and decided not to hire\r\nOswald because of the unfavorable responses which his inquiries\r\nproduced.[A13-1210] Later that day, Oswald telephoned Marina and asked\r\nher to have Mrs. Paine pick him up in Dallas. Marina refused, and he\r\nhitchhiked out to the Paine home,[A13-1211] where he spent part or all\r\nof the weekend.[A13-1212] Marina testified that although her husband\r\n“changed for the better” and treated her better after his Mexican\r\ntrip,[A13-1213] she did not want to live with him because she was\r\npregnant and thought it would be better “to be with a woman who spoke\r\nEnglish and Russian.”[A13-1214] On Monday, October 7, Mrs. Paine drove\r\nOswald to the bus station, and he returned to Dallas to look for a job\r\nand a place to live.[A13-1215]\r\n\r\nOswald thought that the YMCA was too expensive for him, and intended\r\nto rent a room.[A13-1216] He inquired about a room at 1026 North\r\nBeckley, where he lived later, but on October 7 there were no\r\nvacancies.[A13-1217] He next responded to a “For Rent” sign at a\r\nrooming house at 621 Marsalis Street. He obtained a room, for which\r\nhe paid the weekly rent of $7 in advance, and moved in on the same\r\nday.[A13-1218] He immediately resumed his job-hunting, relying\r\npartially on referrals by the employment commission.[A13-1219] He\r\nspent much of the time when he was not looking for work in his\r\nroom.[A13-1220] He telephoned his wife daily.[A13-1221] She wrote:\r\n“Lee called twice a day, was worried about my health and about\r\nJune.”[A13-1222] On Friday, Oswald told his landlady, Mrs. Mary\r\nBledsoe, that he was going to Irving for the weekend but would return\r\nthe following week. She refused to rent the room to him for another\r\nweek because she didn’t like him.[A13-1223]\r\n\r\nOswald spent the weekend of October 12-13 at Mrs. Paine’s home, during\r\nwhich time she gave him a driving lesson.[A13-1224] He told her that\r\nhe had received the last of the unemployment checks due him, and that\r\nit had been smaller than the previous ones. Mrs. Paine testified that\r\nOswald was extremely discouraged because his wife was expecting a baby,\r\nhe had no job prospects in sight, and he no longer had any source of\r\nincome.[A13-1225]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Mrs. Paine drove Oswald into Dallas, since she had other\r\nbusiness there.[A13-1226] He picked up his bag from Mrs. Bledsoe’s\r\nroominghouse[A13-1227] and later that day rented a room at 1026 North\r\nBeckley Avenue from Mrs. A. C. Johnson for $8 a week. He registered as\r\nO. H. Lee and moved in immediately.[A13-1228] Oswald felt that this\r\nroom was more comfortable than the previous one, particularly because\r\nhe had television and refrigerator privileges.[A13-1229] He apparently\r\ncontinued to spend most of his evenings in his room.[A13-1230] He\r\nborrowed books from the library[A13-1231] and had subscriptions to\r\nvarious periodicals, including Time, the Worker, the Militant, and some\r\nRussian periodicals.[A13-1232]\r\n\r\nOn that Monday, Mrs. Paine mentioned the Oswalds’ financial and\r\nemployment problems to neighbors whom she was visiting. Mrs. Linnie\r\nMae Randle, who was also present, remarked that she thought that her\r\nyounger brother, Buell Wesley Frazier, who worked at the Texas School\r\nBook Depository, had said that there was a job opening there. When\r\nMarina heard of this, she asked Mrs. Paine to call the Depository to\r\nsee if there was an opening.[A13-1233] Mrs. Paine called Roy S. Truly,\r\nsuperintendent of the Depository, who indicated that he would talk to\r\nOswald if he would apply in person.[A13-1234] When Oswald telephoned\r\nthe Paine house on Monday evening, Mrs. Paine told him about this\r\npossibility.[A13-1235] On the next day, Oswald was interviewed by Truly\r\nand hired in a temporary capacity. He began work on Wednesday, October\r\n16. His duties were to fill book orders; his hours were 8 a.m. to 4:45\r\np.m., for which he received $1.25 an hour.[A13-1236]\r\n\r\nBoth the Oswalds were elated with the new job,[A13-1237] although\r\nit apparently required little skill or experience[A13-1238] and he\r\nindicated that he still hoped to obtain a better job.[A13-1239] He did\r\na satisfactory job at the Depository,[A13-1240] but he kept to himself\r\nand very few of his fellow employees got to know him.[A13-1241]\r\n\r\nDuring his first week at work, Oswald became acquainted with Frazier,\r\nwith whom he arranged to ride to Irving on weekends.[A13-1242]\r\nOn Friday, October 18, Frazier drove him from work to the Paine\r\nhome;[A13-1243] since it was his birthday, Marina and Ruth Paine had\r\narranged a small celebration.[A13-1244] On Sunday, he stayed with June\r\nand the Paine children, while Mrs. Paine drove Marina to Parkland\r\nHospital where she gave birth to a second daughter, Rachel.[A13-1245]\r\nHe went to work on Monday, but that evening visited Marina in the\r\nhospital and spent the night in Irving.[A13-1246] Marina wrote:\r\n\r\n    Monday evening Lee visited me in the hospital. He was very\r\n    happy at the birth of another daughter and even wept a little.\r\n    He said that two daughters were better for each other--two\r\n    sisters. He stayed with me about two hours.[A13-1247]\r\n\r\nOswald returned to Dallas the next morning.[A13-1248]\r\n\r\nOswald wrote to Arnold Johnson of the Communist Party, U.S.A., that on\r\nthe evening of October 23, he had attended an “ultra right” meeting\r\nheaded by Gen. Edwin A. Walker.[A13-1249] Two evenings later, he\r\naccompanied Michael Paine to a meeting of the American Civil Liberties\r\nUnion, held at Southern Methodist University.[A13-1250] At this\r\nmeeting, a statement was made to the effect that members of the John\r\nBirch Society should not be considered anti-Semitic; Oswald rose and\r\nstated that at the meeting which he had attended 2 days earlier, he\r\nhad heard a number of anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic statements. Later\r\nin the evening, Oswald became involved in a discussion with several\r\npeople, including Frank Krystinik, who was employed with Paine at the\r\nBell Helicopter plant. During this conversation, Oswald expressed\r\nMarxist views and declared that he was a Marxist, although denying that\r\nhe was a Communist. He admitted that the United States was superior to\r\nthe Soviet Union in the area of civil liberties and praised President\r\nKennedy for his work in that connection.[A13-1251] Krystinik testified\r\nthat he got the impression that Oswald did not fully understand the\r\nviews he was expounding.[A13-1252]\r\n\r\nThroughout that week Oswald telephoned his wife to inquire about her\r\nhealth and that of the baby. He spent the weekend at the Paine home,\r\nto which Marina and Rachel had returned during the week.[A13-1253]\r\nOn Friday, November 1, he obtained post office box No. 6225 at the\r\nTerminal Annex Post Office Station. He indicated that the box would\r\nalso be used to receive mail for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and\r\nthe American Civil Liberties Union.[A13-1254] Once again he spent the\r\nweekend in Irving.[A13-1255]\r\n\r\nThroughout this period, the FBI had been aware of the whereabouts\r\nof the Oswalds. There was a record in the Dallas office of the FBI\r\nthat Oswald subscribed to the Worker, engaged in Fair Play for Cuba\r\nCommittee activities and had traveled to Mexico.[A13-1256] An FBI\r\nagent visited the Paine home on November 1 and, accompanied by another\r\nagent, again on November 5, and spoke briefly with Mrs. Paine. On\r\nneither occasion was Oswald present.[A13-1257] Ruth Paine noted\r\nthe agent’s name and telephone number and, in accordance with her\r\nhusband’s instructions, Marina noted the license number of the agent’s\r\nautomobile, all of which was subsequenty reported to Oswald.[A13-1258]\r\nBoth Mrs. Paine and Marina testified that Oswald was troubled by the\r\nFBI’s interest in him.[A13-1259] He declared that the FBI was “trying\r\nto inhibit” his activities,[A13-1260] and wrote the Soviet Embassy in\r\nWashington:\r\n\r\n    The Federal Bureu of Investigation is not now interested in\r\n    my activities in the progressive organization “Fair Play for\r\n    Cuba Committee” of which I was secretary in New Orleans (state\r\n    Louisiana) since I no longer reside in that state. However, the\r\n    F.B.I. has visted us here in Dallas, Texas, on November 1st.\r\n    Agent James P. Hasty warned me that if I engaged in F.P.C.C.\r\n    activities in Texas the F.B.I. will again take an “interest” in\r\n    me.\r\n\r\n    This agent also ‘suggested’ to Marina Nichilayeva that she\r\n    could remain in the United States under F.B.I. ‘protection’,\r\n    that is, she could defect from the Soviet Uion, of couse, I and\r\n    my wife strongly protested these tactics by the notorious F.B.I.\r\n\r\n    Please inform us of the arrival of our Soviet entrance visa’s\r\n    as soon as they come.[A13-1261] (See Commission Exhibit 15, p.\r\n    311.)\r\n\r\nMarina testified that the statements, both by and to the FBI agents,\r\nto which her husband referred in this letter, were in fact never\r\nmade.[A13-1262]\r\n\r\nThe following Friday, November 8, Oswald as usual drove to the Paine\r\nhouse with Frazier.[A13-1263] On Saturday Mrs. Paine took him to\r\nthe Texas Drivers’ License Examining Station, but because it was an\r\nelection day the station was closed. Oswald stayed at the Paines\r\nthrough Monday, November 11, which was Veterans Day. During the\r\nweekend, Mrs. Paine gave Oswald a second driving lesson.[A13-1264]\r\n\r\nOswald did not go to Irving on the next weekend. His wife had asked\r\nhim not to come because Michael Paine, with whom Oswald did not get\r\nalong, would be there to celebrate his daughter’s birthday. Also, she\r\nfelt that because he had stayed for 3 days the preceding weekend, he\r\nwould abuse Mrs. Paine’s hospitality if he returned so soon. Oswald\r\ntelephoned Marina on Saturday afternoon and said that he had returned\r\nto the drivers’ license examining station that morning but had not\r\nwaited because there was a long line.[A13-1265]\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, November 17, at Marina’s request, Ruth Paine telephoned\r\nOswald at the Beckley Avenue number, which he had given to Marina.\r\nWhen she asked for him, she was told that no one by that name lived\r\nat the address, which greatly surprised her. On the next day, Oswald\r\ntelephoned his wife. When she indicated that she had been upset by the\r\nfact that there had been no Lee Oswald at the number which she had\r\nasked Mrs. Paine to call, Oswald became angry; he said that he was\r\nusing a fictitious name and that she should not have called the Beckley\r\nAvenue number.[A13-1266] He did not telephone on the following day,\r\nwhich was unusual.[A13-1267]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Thursday, November 21, Oswald asked Frazier to take\r\nhim to Irving when he went home that evening, saying that he wanted\r\nto pick up some curtain rods.[A13-1268] His arrival was a surprise\r\nbecause he generally asked Mrs. Paine’s permission before arriving\r\nfor a visit.[A13-1269] The women thought that he had come to Irving\r\nbecause he felt badly about arguing with his wife about the use of the\r\nfictitious name.[A13-1270] He said that he was lonely, because he had\r\nnot come the preceding weekend, and told Marina that he “wanted to make\r\nhis peace” with her.[A13-1271] He spent the time before dinner on the\r\nlawn playing with his daughter.[A13-1272] However, when he attempted\r\nto talk to his wife she would not answer, which upset him. He asked\r\nher to live with him in Dallas, and she refused.[A13-1273] After\r\nsupper, Oswald watched television while the women cleaned the house\r\nand prepared their children for bed.[A13-1274] He retired early in the\r\nevening at about 9.[A13-1275]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XIV\r\n\r\nAnalysis of Lee Harvey Oswald’s Finances From June 13, 1962, Through\r\nNovember 22, 1963\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following analysis of Lee Harvey Oswald’s receipts and expenditures\r\nfor the period June 13, 1962, through November 22, 1963, contains a\r\ncomplete record of all funds that he and his wife are reported to\r\nhave received and disbursed from all known sources. It also contains\r\nan estimate for food, clothing, and incidental expenses, which\r\ninclude telephone calls, money order and check cashing fees, postage,\r\nlocal transportation costs, personal care goods and services, local\r\nnewspapers, and similar small items. Oswald’s expenditures for food,\r\nclothing, and incidentals were estimated at $100 per month, except for\r\nthose months in which his wife and children resided with relatives or\r\nacquaintances. The estimate reflects Oswald’s frugal living habits\r\nduring this period, as described in chapter VI of this report. The\r\nCommission has been advised by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the\r\nU.S. Department of Labor that this estimate is a little higher than\r\nwould be normal for a family in Oswald’s income class residing in the\r\nsouthern region of the United States.

Naturalization Service of\r\nthe U.S. Department of Justice\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom September 4, 1959, when he applied for his first passport, until\r\nshortly before the assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald had numerous\r\ndealings with the U.S. Department of State in Washington and with the\r\nAmerican Embassy in Moscow. In connection with Marina Oswald’s entry\r\ninto the United States, the dealings also extended to the Immigration\r\nand Naturalization Service of the Department of Justice. During the\r\ncourse of these dealings, the Department of State and the Immigration\r\nand Naturalization Service were called upon to decide a series of\r\nlegal and administrative questions which arose under the laws of this\r\ncountry. In order to determine whether Lee Harvey Oswald or his wife\r\nreceived any treatment not accorded others in similar positions, the\r\nCommission has examined the manner in which the transactions with\r\nthe Oswalds were handled and the manner in which the relevant legal\r\nquestions were resolved. In light of the facts then available and the\r\napplicable statutes, regulations, and practices in force at the time,\r\nthe Commission has found no indication that the treatment accorded the\r\nOswalds was illegal or different in any respect from the treatment that\r\nother persons similarly situated would have received.\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUANCE OF PASSPORT IN 1959\r\n\r\nOn September 4, 1959, while on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps,\r\nOswald applied for a passport before a clerk of the superior court\r\nat Santa Ana, Calif.[A15-1] On the application Oswald stated that he\r\nintended to leave the United States for 4 months on approximately\r\nSeptember 21, 1959, by ship from New Orleans, La., and that the\r\npurposes of his trip would be to attend the Albert Schweitzer College\r\nin Switzerland[A15-2] and the University of Turku in Finland, and to\r\nvisit Cuba, the Dominican Republic, England, France, Switzerland,\r\nGermany, Finland and Russia as a tourist. With the application, Oswald\r\nsubmitted a statement signed by a Marine officer that he was to be\r\ndischarged from the Corps on September 10, 1959.[A15-3] The passport,\r\nNo. 1733242, was routinely issued on September 10, 1959.[A15-4] At the\r\ntime, the United States proscribed travel to none of the countries\r\nnamed in Oswald’s application.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSWALD’S ATTEMPTS TO RENOUNCE HIS U.S. CITIZENSHIP\r\n\r\nAmerican officials in Moscow had no knowledge that Oswald was in\r\nRussia until October 31, 1959,[A15-5] more than 2 weeks after he\r\nhad arrived, since he failed to register at the U.S. Embassy, as\r\nAmericans traveling through Russia normally did.[A15-6] However, on\r\nOctober 31, 1959, a Saturday, Oswald presented himself at the American\r\nEmbassy in Moscow.[A15-7] He placed his passport on the receptionist’s\r\ndesk and informed her that he had come to “dissolve his American\r\ncitizenship.”[A15-8] She immediately summoned the consul, Richard\r\nE. Snyder, who invited Oswald into his office.[A15-9] In the room\r\nwith Snyder was his assistant, John A. McVickar, who observed what\r\nensued.[A15-10] Snyder recalled Oswald as “neatly and very presentably\r\ndressed,”[A15-11] but he also remembered his arrogance. Oswald seemed\r\nto “know what his mission was. He took charge, in a sense, of the\r\nconversation right from the beginning.”[A15-12]\r\n\r\nOswald stated at once that he was there to renounce his\r\ncitizenship[A15-13] and that “his allegiance was to the Soviet\r\nUnion.”[A15-14] He said he had already applied for Soviet\r\ncitizenship.[A15-15] He said he knew the provisions of American law\r\non loss of citizenship and did not want to hear them reviewed by\r\nSnyder.[A15-16] Having taken his passport back from the receptionist,\r\nOswald put it on Snyder’s desk.[A15-17] Snyder noticed that Oswald had\r\ninked out the portion which would have shown his address in the United\r\nStates.[A15-18] Oswald also presented Snyder with a note[A15-19] which\r\nhe had prepared in advance, which reads:\r\n\r\n    I Lee Harey Oswald do herby request that my present citizenship\r\n    in the United States of america, be revoked.\r\n\r\n    I have entered the Soviet Union for the express purpose of\r\n    appling for citizenship in the Soviet Union, through the means\r\n    of naturalization.\r\n\r\n    My request for citizenship is now pending before Suprem Soviet\r\n    of the U.S.S.R.\r\n\r\n    I take these steps for political reasons. My request for the\r\n    revoking of my American citizenship is made only after the\r\n    longest and most serious considerations.\r\n\r\n    I affirm that my allegiance is to the Union of Soviet Socialist\r\n    Republics.[A15-20]\r\n\r\nOswald told Snyder that he had not mentioned his intent to remain in\r\nthe Soviet Union to the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki at the time he had\r\napplied for his tourist visa.[A15-21] Oswald’s passport, upon which\r\nhis Soviet visa was stamped, shows that by the 31st of October he had\r\nalready overstayed his visa, despite a 1-day extension which he had\r\nreceived.[A15-22]\r\n\r\nOswald gave as his “principal reason” for wanting to renounce his\r\ncitizenship, “I am a Marxist.”[A15-23] He stated that he admired the\r\nsystem and policies of the Soviet Union and desired to serve the Soviet\r\nState, and that his intent to defect to the Soviet Union had been\r\nformed long before he was discharged from the Marine Corps.[A15-24]\r\nShortly after the interview, Snyder observed that Oswald had “displayed\r\nall the airs of a new sophomore partyliner.”[A15-25] At one point,\r\nOswald alluded to hardships endured by his mother as a “worker” and\r\nsaid he did not intend to let this happen to him.[A15-26] He stated\r\nthat his Marine service in Okinawa and elsewhere had given him a chance\r\n“to observe American imperialism,” and he displayed some resentment at\r\nnot having been given a higher rank in the Marine Corps.[A15-27] Oswald\r\nstated to Snyder that he had voluntarily told Soviet officials that he\r\nwould make known to them all information concerning the Marine Corps\r\nand his specialty therein, radar operation, as he possessed.[A15-28]\r\n\r\nSnyder did not permit Oswald to renounce his citizenship at that\r\ntime. He told Oswald that his renunciation could not be effected on a\r\nSaturday, but that if he would return on a day when the Embassy was\r\nopen for business, the transaction could then be completed.[A15-29]\r\nSnyder testified that his real reason for delaying Oswald was that\r\nhe believed, as a matter of sound professional practice, that no one\r\nshould be permitted to renounce his American citizenship precipitously;\r\nsuch an act has extremely serious consequences, and, once accomplished,\r\nit is irrevocable.[A15-30] Snyder noticed that Oswald was young,\r\napparently not well educated and obviously in a highly emotional\r\nstate.[A15-31] Snyder testified: “particularly in the case of a minor,\r\nI could not imagine myself writing out the renunciation form, and\r\nhaving him sign it, on the spot, without making him leave my office\r\nand come back at some other time, even if it is only a few hours\r\nintervening.”[A15-32] Snyder’s decision was also influenced by his\r\nfamiliarity with a recent unfavorable incident in which an American\r\ncitizen by the name of Petrulli had been allowed to renounce his\r\ncitizenship hastily, without awareness that Petrulli was mentally\r\nill at the time.[A15-33] Snyder was able to persuade Oswald to tell\r\nhim his home address and the name of his mother, however, by saying\r\nthat no progress on his renunciation could be made without this\r\ninformation.[A15-34] The State Department has advised that Snyder’s\r\ntreatment of Oswald “was in line * * * with the general policy of the\r\nDepartment to discourage expatriation of American citizens.”[A15-35]\r\n\r\nThe same day, the Embassy sent a telegram to the Department of State,\r\nadvising that Oswald had appeared there in an attempt to renounce\r\nhis American citizenship, and setting out most of the details of\r\nthe interview with Snyder.[A15-36] Copies were immediately furnished\r\nto the FBI[A15-37] and the CIA.[A15-38] The telegram was followed on\r\nNovember 2, 1959, by an Embassy report addresed to the Department of\r\nState,[A15-39] which concluded:\r\n\r\n    * * * in view of the Petrulli case and other considerations,\r\n    the Embassy proposes to delay action on Oswald’s request to\r\n    execute an oath of renunciation to the extent dictated by\r\n    developments and subject to the Department’s advice.[A15-40]\r\n\r\nCopies of this memorandum were also furnished both Federal security\r\nagencies.[A15-41]\r\n\r\nAfter having received the telegram of October 31, 1959,[A15-42] but\r\nnot the Embassy Despatch of November 2, 1959, the State Department on\r\nNovember 2, 1959, sent a telegram to the Moscow Embassy which read in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n    If Oswald insists on renouncing U.S. citizenship, Section 1999\r\n    Revised Statutes precludes Embassy withholding right to do so\r\n    regardless status his application pending Soviet Government and\r\n    final action taken Petrulli case.[A15-43]\r\n\r\nThis telegram, like most of the communications from the Department\r\nregarding Oswald, was prepared in the Passport Office and cleared by\r\nthe Office of Eastern European Affairs and the Office of Soviet Union\r\nAffairs.[A15-44]\r\n\r\nOswald never returned to the Embassy.[A15-45] On November 6, 1959,\r\nthe Embassy received[A15-46] a handwritten letter from Oswald on the\r\nstationery of the Metropole Hotel, dated November 3, 1959, which read:\r\n\r\n    I, Lee Harvey Oswald, do hereby request that my present United\r\n    States citizenship be revoked.\r\n\r\n    I appeered in person, at the consulate office of the United\r\n    States Embassy, Moscow, on Oct. 31st, for the purpose of\r\n    signing the formal papers to this effect. This legal right I\r\n    was refused at that time.\r\n\r\n    I wish to protest against this action, and against the conduct\r\n    of the official of the United States consular service who acted\r\n    on behalf of the United States government.\r\n\r\n    My application, requesting that I be considered for citizenship\r\n    in the Soviet Union is now pending before the Surprem Soviet\r\n    of the U.S.S.R.. In the event of acceptance, I will request\r\n    my government to lodge a formal protest regarding this\r\n    incident.[A15-47]\r\n\r\nThe Embassy immediately informed the Department of the receipt of\r\nthis letter and advised that it intended to reply to Oswald by letter\r\ntelling him that, if he wished, he could appear at the Embassy on\r\nany normal business day and request that the necessary expatriation\r\ndocuments be prepared.[A15-48] On the same day, November 6, the\r\nEmbassy sent Oswald a letter so advising him.[A15-49] From then until\r\nNovember 30 the Embassy attempted to communicate with Oswald on several\r\noccasions to deliver messages from his relatives in the United States\r\nurging him to reconsider, but he refused to receive the messages or\r\ntalk to anyone from the Embassy.[A15-50] The messages were therefore\r\nsent to him by registered mail.[A15-51]\r\n\r\nOn November 16, 1959, Priscilla Johnson, an American newspaperwoman\r\nstationed in Moscow, interviewed Oswald at the Metropole Hotel.[A15-52]\r\nOn November 17, 1959, she informed the Embassy of her interview, and\r\nthe information was recorded in a file memorandum.[A15-53] Oswald\r\ntold Miss Johnson that he was scheduled to leave Moscow within a few\r\ndays. She thought that Oswald “may have purposely not carried through\r\nhis original intent to renounce [citizenship] in order to leave a\r\ncrack open.”[A15-54] The Embassy accordingly informed the Department\r\nof State about 2 weeks later that Oswald had departed from the Hotel\r\nMetropole within the last few days.[A15-55] According to his “Historic\r\nDiary”[A15-56] and other records available to the Commission,[A15-57]\r\nhowever, Oswald probably did not in fact leave Moscow for Minsk until\r\nabout January 4, 1960. Miss Johnson’s report of her interview with\r\nOswald was the last information about him which the U.S. Government was\r\nto receive until February 13, 1961.[A15-58]\r\n\r\nOn March 6, 1960, Oswald’s mother asked Representative James C.\r\nWright, Jr., of Texas to help her locate her son. The Congressman\r\nforwarded her inquiry to the Department of State, which in turn sent\r\nit to the Embassy.[A15-59] In response, the Embassy in Moscow informed\r\nthe Department on March 28, 1960, that they had had no contact with\r\nOswald since November 9, 1959.[A15-60] The Embassy went on to say\r\nthat it had no evidence that Oswald had expatriated himself “other\r\nthan his announced intention to do so.” It believed, therefore, that\r\nsince Oswald was presumably still an American citizen, the American\r\nGovernment could properly make inquiry concerning him through a note\r\nto the Soviet Foreign Office. The Embassy went on to suggest, however,\r\nthat it would be preferable if Oswald’s mother wrote a letter to her\r\nson which could then be forwarded by the Department to the Soviet\r\nGovernment.[A15-61]\r\n\r\nThe Department replied on May 10, 1960, that no action should be\r\ntaken in the case other than on a request voluntarily submitted by a\r\nmember of Oswald’s family.[A15-62] On June 22, a second communication\r\nwas dispatched, asking whether the Embassy had been able to contact\r\nOswald.[A15-63] On July 6, 1960, the Embassy replied that it had\r\nreceived no further communication with anyone on the subject of Oswald\r\nand that in view of the Department’s memorandum of May 10, 1960, it\r\nintended to take no further action in the matter.[A15-64] Mrs. Oswald\r\napparently took no steps to follow up on her original inquiry.\r\n\r\nUnder the procedures in effect in 1960, a “refusal sheet” was prepared\r\nin the Department of State Passport Office whenever circumstances\r\ncreated the possibility that a prospective applicant would not be\r\nentitled to receive an American passport.[A15-65] The records section\r\nof the Passport Office, on the basis of the refusal sheet, would\r\nprepare what was known as a lookout card[A15-66] and file it in the\r\nlookout file in the Passport Office. Whenever anyone applied for a\r\npassport from any city in the world, his application was immediately\r\nforwarded to this office, and his name and date of birth checked\r\nagainst the lookout file.[A15-67] If a lookout card was found,\r\nappropriate action, including the possible refusal of a passport,\r\nwas taken.[A15-68] Passport Office procedures also provided that the\r\nlookout card would be removed from a prospective applicant’s file\r\nwhenever facts warranted an unquestioned passport grant.[A15-69]\r\n\r\nOn March 25, 1960, the Passport Office had made up a “refusal sheet”\r\non Lee Harvey Oswald, typed across which was the explanation that\r\nOswald “may have been naturalized in the Soviet Union or otherwise * *\r\n* expatriated himself.”[A15-70] An Operations Memorandum stating the\r\nreasons for which the card had been prepared was drawn up on March 28\r\nand also put on file[A15-71] and a copy sent to the Embassy. It advised\r\nthe Embassy to take no further action on the Oswald case unless it\r\ncame into possession of evidence upon which to base the preparation\r\nof a certificate of loss of nationality. Included in the operations\r\nmemorandum was the following:\r\n\r\n    An appropriate notice has been placed in the lookout card\r\n    section of the Passport Office in the event that Mr. Oswald\r\n    should apply for documentation at a post outside the Soviet\r\n    Union.[A15-72]\r\n\r\nDespite these indications that a lookout card was prepared, the\r\nDepartment of State on May 18, 1964, informed the Commission that\r\n“investigations, to date, failed to reveal any other indication or\r\nevidence that a lookout card was ever prepared, modified or removed.”\r\nNo such card was ever located, and certain file entries indicate that\r\nsuch a card was never prepared.[A15-73]\r\n\r\nThe State Department has advised the Commission that as of October\r\n1959 the Department had “developed information which might reasonably\r\nhave caused it to prepare * * * a lookout card for Lee Harvey\r\nOswald.”[A15-74] The Passport Office employee who prepared the refusal\r\nsheet for Oswald has suggested as a possible explanation of the failure\r\nto prepare a lookout card that between the day she prepared the refusal\r\nsheet and the time the records section would normally have prepared\r\nthe lookout card, Oswald’s file was temporarily pulled from its place\r\nbecause the Department received some additional correspondence from the\r\nEmbassy. When the file was returned, she suggested, it may have been\r\nassumed that the card had already been prepared.[A15-75]\r\n\r\nHad a lookout card been prepared on the ground of possible\r\nexpatriation, it would have been removed and destroyed after the\r\ndecision was made in 1961 that Oswald had not expatriated himself and\r\nthus prior to the time that he applied for a second passport in June\r\n1963. Hence, the Department’s apparent failure to prepare a lookout\r\ncard on Oswald had no effect on its future actions. As of February\r\n20, 1964, the Department issued additional regulations regarding the\r\nmanner in which the lookout file is to be handled.[A15-76] On March\r\n14, 1964, a category was established for returned defectors, so\r\nthat these persons automatically have lookout cards in their files,\r\nand on July 27, 1964, the Office of Security of the Department of\r\nState issued a procedural study of the lookout-card system, with\r\nrecommendations.[A15-77]\r\n\r\n\r\nRETURN AND RENEWAL OF OSWALD’S 1959 PASSPORT\r\n\r\nNegotiations Between Oswald and the Embassy\r\n\r\nOn February 1, 1961, as a result of a visit by Oswald’s mother to the\r\nDepartment of State on January 25, 1961,[A15-78] the Department sent a\r\nrequest to the Moscow Embassy as follows:\r\n\r\n    The Embassy is requested to inform the [Soviet] Ministry of\r\n    Foreign Affairs that Mr. Oswald’s mother is worried as to his\r\n    present safety, and is anxious to hear from him.[A15-79]\r\n\r\nThe inquiry went to the Embassy by diplomatic pouch and was received in\r\nMoscow on February 10 or 11.[A15-80] On February 13, before the Embassy\r\nhad acted on the Department’s request,[A15-81] the Embassy received an\r\nundated letter from Oswald postmarked Minsk, February 5. The letter\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    Since I have not received a reply to my letter of December\r\n    1960, I am writing again asking that you consider my request\r\n    for the return of my American passport.\r\n\r\n    I desire to return to the United States, that is if we could\r\n    come to some agreement concerning the dropping of any legal\r\n    proceedings against me. If so, than I would be free to ask the\r\n    Russian authorities to allow me to leave. If I could show them\r\n    my American passport, I am of the opinion they would give me an\r\n    exit visa.\r\n\r\n    They have at no time insisted that I take Russian citizenship.\r\n    I am living here with non-permanent type papers for a foreigner.\r\n\r\n    I cannot leave Minsk without permission, therefore I am writing\r\n    rather than calling in person.\r\n\r\n    I hope that in recalling the responsibility I have to america\r\n    that you remember your’s in doing everything you can to help me\r\n    since I am an american citizen.[A15-82]\r\n\r\nDespite Oswald’s reference to his letter of December 1960, there is\r\nno indication that he had written to the Embassy previously.[A15-83]\r\nFurthermore, his diary refers to his February 1 letter as his “first\r\nrequest” concerning his return to the United States.[A15-84]\r\n\r\nOn February 28, 1961, the Embassy wrote Oswald that he would\r\nhave to come to Moscow to discuss the passport and expatriation\r\nmatters.[A15-85] Then on March 20, 1961, a second letter from Oswald,\r\ndated March 12, was received by the Embassy. It read:\r\n\r\n    In reply to your recent letter. I find it inconvenient to come\r\n    to Moscow for the sole purpose of an interview.\r\n\r\n    In my last letter I believe I stated that I cannot leave the\r\n    city of Minsk without permission.\r\n\r\n    I believe there exist in the United States also a law in\r\n    regards to resident foreigners from Socialist countries,\r\n    traveling between cities.\r\n\r\n    I do not think it would be appropriate for me to request to\r\n    leave Minsk in order to visit the American Embassy. In any\r\n    event, the granting of permission is a long drawn out affair,\r\n    and I find that there is a hesitation on the part of local\r\n    officials to even start the process.\r\n\r\n    I have no intention of abusing my position here, and I am sure\r\n    you would not want me to.\r\n\r\n    I see no reasons for any preliminary inquires not to be put in\r\n    the form of a questionnaire and sent to me.\r\n\r\n    I understand that personal interviews undobtedly make to work\r\n    of the Embassy staff lighter, than written correspondence,\r\n    however, in some cases other means must be employed.[A15-86]\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the first letter postmarked February 5, the Embassy\r\non February 28 forwarded a despatch to the Department informing it of\r\nOswald’s letter and its reply to Oswald. At that time, the Embassy\r\nalso inquired of the Department whether Oswald would be subject to\r\nprosecution on any grounds if he should return to the United States\r\nand, if so, whether Oswald should be so informed. The Department was\r\nalso asked whether there was any objection to returning Oswald’s 1959\r\npassport to him by mail, since that might facilitate his application\r\nfor a Soviet exit visa.[A15-87] Upon receiving Oswald’s March 20\r\nletter, the Embassy again consulted with Washington. The Embassy\r\nproposed that it write Oswald repeating that he must come to Moscow\r\nif he wanted to discuss reentering the United States and pointing\r\nout that the Soviet government did not object to such visits by\r\nAmerican citizens.[A15-88] Such a letter was mailed to Oswald on March\r\n24.[A15-89]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the State Department was considering the Embassy\r\ndespatch of February 28, 1961.[A15-90] Although a different response\r\nwas originally recommended by a staff member in the Passport\r\nOffice,[A15-91] the Department instructed the Embassy on April 13\r\nthat for security reasons Oswald’s passport should be given to him\r\nonly if he personally appeared at the Embassy and that even then he\r\nwas to receive the document only after a full investigation had been\r\nmade and the Embassy was satisfied that he had not renounced his\r\nAmerican citizenship. Also, he was to present evidence that he had made\r\narrangements to depart from the Soviet Union to travel to the United\r\nStates, and his passport was to be stamped valid for direct return\r\nto the United States only. The Department also told the Embassy that\r\nOswald could not be advised whether or not he would be prosecuted for\r\nany possible offenses should he return to the United States.[A15-92]\r\nMatters remained in this posture for over a month. During the interim,\r\nOswald met and married Marina Nikolaevna Prusakova.[A15-93]\r\n\r\nOn May 26, 1961, the Embassy sent a despatch to the Department[A15-94]\r\nadvising that on May 25, 1961, it had received a letter from Oswald\r\npostmarked Moscow, May 16, 1961.[A15-95] In his latest letter Oswald\r\nsaid he wanted “to make it clear” that he was asking for full\r\nguarantees that he would not be prosecuted “under any circumstances”\r\nshould he return to the United States. Oswald went on to say that if\r\nthe Embassy could not give him these assurances, he would “endeavor to\r\nuse my relatives in the United States, to see about getting something\r\ndone in Washington.” He also informed the Embassy that he was married\r\nto a Russian woman who would want to accompany him back to his native\r\ncountry, and he once again repeated his reluctance to come to Moscow.\r\nThe Embassy suggested that it reply to Oswald by repeating that the\r\nquestion of citizenship could only be made on the basis of a personal\r\ninterview, and by advising Oswald of the requirements and procedures\r\npertaining to his wife’s immigration. The despatch noted that Oswald’s\r\nletter referred to his present Soviet internal passport in which he\r\nclaimed to be designated as “without citizenship,” and observed: “It\r\nwould appear on this basis that Oswald has not yet expatriated himself\r\nunder Section 349(a) (1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.” The\r\nEmbassy inquired whether the Department considered Oswald entitled “to\r\nthe protection of the United States Government while he continues to\r\nreside abroad under present circumstances in the absence of reasonable\r\nevidence that he has committed an expatriating act?”\r\n\r\nThe Department answered the despatch under date of July 11, 1961. It\r\nsaid that it was not entirely clear what the description “without\r\ncitizenship” means, i.e., “whether he is without Soviet citizenship or\r\nwithout any citizenship.” The instructions continued:\r\n\r\n    In any event in the absence of evidence showing that Mr. Oswald\r\n    has definitely lost United States citizenship he apparently\r\n    maintains that technical status. Whether he is entitled to\r\n    the protection of the United States pending any further\r\n    developments concerning his precise status is a matter which\r\n    will be left to the Embassy’s discretion in the event an\r\n    emergency situation should arise. In a situation of this kind,\r\n    not of an emergency nature, the facts should be submitted to\r\n    the Department.\r\n\r\n    It is noted that the Embassy intends to seek the Department’s\r\n    prior advice before granting Mr. Oswald documentation as a\r\n    United States citizen upon any application he may submit.\r\n\r\n    The Embassy’s careful attention to the involved case of Mr.\r\n    Oswald is appreciated * * *[A15-96]\r\n\r\nHowever, on Saturday, July 8, 1961, before the Embassy had received\r\nthe response from Washington, Oswald appeared without warning at the\r\nEmbassy in Moscow. Snyder came down to meet Oswald after Oswald called\r\nhim on the house telephone, and after a brief talk, asked Oswald to\r\nreturn on Monday, July 10.[A15-97] Later that day Oswald telephoned\r\nhis wife and told her to come to Moscow, which she did the next\r\nday.[A15-98] Oswald returned alone to the American Embassy on Monday,\r\nwhere Snyder questioned him about his life in Russia. According to a\r\nmemorandum which Snyder prepared shortly afterwards:\r\n\r\n    Twenty months of the realities of life in the Soviet Union have\r\n    clearly had a maturing effect on Oswald. He stated frankly that\r\n    he learned a hard lesson the hard way and that he had been\r\n    completely relieved about his illusions about the Soviet Union\r\n    * * * Much of the arrogance and bravado which characterized\r\n    him on his first visit to the Embassy appears to have left\r\n    him.[A15-99]\r\n\r\nOswald told Snyder that despite the statement he had given him in\r\nOctober 1959, he had never applied for Soviet citizenship, but only\r\nfor permission to reside in the Soviet Union. He presented his Soviet\r\ninternal passport, which described him as without citizenship of any\r\nkind. Oswald said that he had been employed since January 13, 1960,\r\nas a metal worker in the research shop in the Byelorussian Radio and\r\nTelevision Factory in Minsk. He claimed that he had taken no oath of\r\nallegiance of any kind, and that he had not been required to sign any\r\npapers in connection with this employment. He added that he was not a\r\nmember of the factory trade union organization. Oswald said that he\r\nwas earning 90 rubles ($90) a month and that he had saved about 200\r\nrubles ($200) toward travel expenses to the United States. He denied\r\nthat he had made any derogatory statements concerning the United States\r\nto radio, press, or TV in the Soviet Union, and he denied that he had\r\nturned over any information to the Russians as he had threatened to do\r\nin the 1959 interview with Snyder.[A15-100]\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the interview Oswald filled out an application for\r\nrenewal of his American passport.[A15-101] The renewal application was\r\nrequired since Oswald’s existing passport would expire on September 10,\r\n1961,[A15-102] and it was extremely unlikely that he would be able to\r\nobtain the requisite Soviet departure documents before that time. The\r\nrenewal application contained a printed statement which set forth, in\r\nthe disjunctive, a series of acts which, if committed by the applicant,\r\nwould either automatically disqualify him from receiving a passport on\r\nthe ground that he had lost his American citizenship, or would raise\r\na question whether he might be so disqualified. The printed statement\r\nwas preceded by two phrases, “have,” and, “have not,” the first\r\nphrase being printed directly above the second. One carbon copy of\r\nthe application indicates Oswald signed the document after the second\r\nphrase, “have not,” had been typed over, thereby apparently admitting\r\nthat he had committed one or more of the acts which would at least\r\nraise a question as to whether he had expatriated himself. Snyder was\r\nnot able to remember with certainty to which of the acts listed on the\r\nstatement Oswald’s mark was intended to refer, but believed it may have\r\nbeen to “swearing allegiance to a foreign state.” [A15-103] He points\r\nout that the strikeout of “have not” may also have been a clerical\r\nerror.[A15-104] On the actual signed copy of the application kept in\r\nthe files of the Moscow Embassy, which is not a carbon copy of the copy\r\nsent to the Department, the strikeout is slightly above the “have;”\r\ntherefore, since the “have” is itself printed above the “have not,” the\r\nstrikeout may have been intended to obliterate the “have.”[A15-105]\r\n\r\nIn any event, Oswald filled out the supplementary questionnaire\r\nwhich was required to be completed if the applicant admitted he had\r\nperformed one or more of the possibly expatriating acts. He signed\r\nthe questionnaire under oath.[A15-106] Snyder testified that it was\r\nroutine for any kind of “problem case” to fill out the supplementary\r\nquestionnaire.[A15-107] The Passport Office employee who processed the\r\nOswald case in Washington testified that she routinely regarded the\r\nquestionnaire rather than the application itself as the controlling\r\ndocument for expatriation purposes, so that she probably paid no\r\nattention to the strikeout.[A15-108]\r\n\r\nThe pertinent questions included on the questionnaire, with Oswald’s\r\nanswers, read as follows:\r\n\r\n    2.(a) Are you known or considered in your community to be a\r\n    national of the country in which you are residing? _No._ (Yes\r\n    or No)\r\n\r\n    (b) If your answer to 2(a) is “No,” explain why not. _On my\r\n    document for residence in the USSR my nationality is American._\r\n\r\n    3.(a) Have you ever sought or obtained registration as a\r\n    national of a foreign country, applied for or obtained a\r\n    passport, certificate, card document or other benefit therefrom\r\n    in which you were described as a national of a country other\r\n    than the United States? _No._ (Yes or No)\r\n\r\n    (b) If your answer to 3(a) is “Yes,” did you voluntarily seek\r\n    or claim such benefits? (Yes or No) If “No,” please explain.\r\n\r\n    _I recived a document for residence in the USSR but I am\r\n    described as being “Without citizenship.”_\r\n\r\n    4.(a) Have you ever informed any local or national official of\r\n    a foreign state that you are a national of the United States?\r\n    _No._ * * *\r\n\r\n    (b) If your answer to 4(a) is “No,” explain why not. _On\r\n    my document for residence in the USSR, my nationality is\r\n    American._\r\n\r\n    6.(a) Have you ever taken an oath or made an affirmation or\r\n    other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state?\r\n    _No._ * * *\r\n\r\n    8. Have you ever accepted, served in, or performed the duties\r\n    of any office, post or employment under the government of a\r\n    foreign state or political subdivision thereof? _No._ * * * _I\r\n    do not regard factory employment as state employment, as is\r\n    meant in the question above._[A15-109]\r\n\r\nOn the basis of these answers, and on the basis of the statements\r\nOswald made orally during the interview, Snyder concluded that Oswald\r\nhad not lost his citizenship. Snyder therefore handed him back his\r\npassport. Pursuant to the instructions from Washington, it was\r\nstamped, “This passport is valid only for direct travel to the United\r\nStates.”[A15-110]\r\n\r\nIn a despatch dated July 11, 1961,[A15-111] the Embassy informed the\r\nDepartment of State of its conclusion that Oswald had not lost his\r\nAmerican citizenship and requested that, if Washington agreed with\r\nthe conclusion, “the Embassy be authorized to renew Oswald’s passport\r\nat its discretion.” The despatch, with which Oswald’s application\r\nand supplemental questionnaire[A15-112] were enclosed, informed the\r\nDepartment that Oswald was questioned at length at the Embassy and that\r\nno evidence was revealed of any act which might be considered as having\r\ncaused the loss of his American citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe Embassy added in the despatch--\r\n\r\n    It is our intention not to renew it [the passport] without\r\n    the Department’s prior approval of the enclosed renewal\r\n    application, and then only upon evidence of a present need for\r\n    the renewal in connection with his efforts to return to the\r\n    United States.[A15-113]\r\n\r\nOswald appeared at the Embassy once again on July 11, 1961, this time\r\naccompanied by Marina, in order to complete the papers necessary to\r\nobtain permission for his wife to enter the United States.[A15-114]\r\nIn a letter dated July 16, 1961, Oswald informed the American\r\nEmbassy about his and Marina’s application to the Soviet officials\r\nfor permission to leave Russia, and described the harassment which\r\nMarina was allegedly undergoing because of her attempts to leave the\r\ncountry.[A15-115]\r\n\r\nBased upon Snyder’s recommendation and the information in its files,\r\nthe Passport Office on August 18, 1961, concluded that Oswald had not\r\nexpatriated himself.[A15-116] Therefore, on that date, the Department\r\nof State sent a despatch to the Embassy in Moscow stating that they\r\nconcurred in the Embassy’s recommendation of July 11, 1961, with\r\nrespect to Oswald’s citizenship:\r\n\r\n    We concur in the conclusion of the Embassy that there is\r\n    available no information and/or evidence to show that Mr.\r\n    Oswald has expatriated himself under the pertinent laws of the\r\n    United States.\r\n\r\n    The renewal of Mr. Oswald’s passport, issued on September 10,\r\n    1959, is authorized upon his referenced application if no\r\n    adverse reason is known, to take place upon his presentation\r\n    of evidence that he needs such renewal in connection with his\r\n    efforts to return to the United States as indicated in the\r\n    final sentence on page 2 of Despatch 29. As requested in the\r\n    final paragraph of the Despatch the Embassy may perform this\r\n    citizenship function for Mr. Oswald at its discretion.\r\n\r\n    Any passport renewal granted to Mr. Oswald should be limited\r\n    to his passport needs and, as stated in the second paragraph\r\n    of the Department’s A-173, April 13, 1961 his passport should\r\n    be made valid for direct return to the United States. The\r\n    additional precaution set forth in the same paragraph should\r\n    be observed and his passport should be delivered to him\r\n    on a personal basis only. When available, a report of his\r\n    travel data should be submitted, as well as a report of any\r\n    intervening developments.[A15-117]\r\n\r\nOn October 12, 1961, the Embassy wrote the Department to inform it of\r\nfour letters it had received from Oswald dated July 15, August 8, and\r\nOctober 4, and an undated letter received in August. With reference to\r\nthese letters, the despatch noted:\r\n\r\n    * * * that Oswald is having difficulty in obtaining exit visas\r\n    for himself and his Soviet wife, and that they are subject\r\n    to increasing harassment in Minsk. In replying to Oswald’s\r\n    latest letter, the Embassy pointed out that it has no way of\r\n    influencing Soviet action on exit visas. It informed him that\r\n    the question of his passport renewal could be discussed with\r\n    him personally at the Embassy. In answer to Oswald’s question,\r\n    the Embassy notified him that the petition to classify his\r\n    wife’s status had not yet been approved.[A15-118]\r\n\r\nThe Department on December 28, 1961, informed the Embassy that\r\nthe Passport Office approved the manner of the Embassy’s reply\r\nto Mr. Oswald with respect “to his receiving further passport\r\nfacilities.”[A15-119] After a further exchange of correspondence\r\nbetween Oswald and the Embassy, dealing primarily with Oswald’s\r\ndifficulties in obtaining the necessary Soviet clearance, his\r\nimpatience in receiving American approval for Marina’s entry into the\r\nUnited States, and his efforts to obtain a repatriation loan,[A15-120]\r\nthe passport problem was finally concluded on May 24, 1962, when the\r\nEmbassy renewed Oswald’s passport for 30 days, stamped it valid for\r\ndirect return to the United States only and handed it to him.[A15-121]\r\nA week later he used it to return to the United States.[A15-122]\r\n\r\nThe decision that Oswald was entitled to a new passport because he\r\nhad not expatriated himself was made for the Embassy by the consul,\r\nRichard E. Snyder.[A15-123] For the Department it was made initially\r\nby Miss Bernice L. Waterman, a worker in the Passport Office for 36\r\nyears, and was then approved by her area chief, by the head of the\r\nForeign Operations Division, and by the Legal Division of the Passport\r\nOffice.[A15-124] Snyder and Miss Waterman have both testified that\r\nthey reached their decisions independently and without influence from\r\nany other person.[A15-125] The Director of the Passport Office and the\r\nLegal Adviser to the State Department both stated that after a review\r\nof the record they concluded that Oswald had not expatriated himself\r\nand that Snyder and Waterman, therefore, acted correctly.[A15-126]\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Justification for the Return and Reissue of Oswald’s Passport\r\n\r\nSince he was born in the United States, Oswald was an American\r\ncitizen.[A15-127] However, Congress has provided that by performing\r\ncertain acts, a person may forfeit his American citizenship. Thus\r\nOswald would have become expatriated while in Russia if he obtained\r\nnaturalization in the Soviet Union, renounced U.S. nationality, took an\r\noath of allegiance to the Soviet Union, or voluntarily worked for the\r\nSoviet Government in a post requiring that the employee take an oath of\r\nallegiance.\r\n\r\n_Naturalization in a foreign state._--Section 349(a)(1) of the\r\nImmigration and Nationality Act of 1952 provides that a U.S. citizen\r\nshall lose his nationality by “obtaining naturalization in a foreign\r\nstate upon his own application * * *.”[A15-128] Although Oswald applied\r\nfor Soviet citizenship, he never received it.[A15-129] Thus, Oswald did\r\nnot expatriate himself under section 349(a)(1).\r\n\r\n_Formal renunciation of U.S. nationality._--Section 349(a)(6) of the\r\nact provides that a U.S. citizen shall lose his citizenship by:\r\n\r\n    * * * making a formal renunciation of nationality before\r\n    a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States in\r\n    a foreign state, in such form as may be prescribed by the\r\n    Secretary of State.[A15-130]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this statute, the Secretary has promulgated\r\nregulations prescribing the manner in which renunciation is to be\r\neffected.[A15-131] The regulations provide, among other things, that 4\r\ncopies of the renunciation form are to be executed and the original and\r\none copy sent to the Department. The Department must then approve the\r\nform and advise the appropriate consular official, who may then furnish\r\na copy of the form to the person to whom it relates. The form itself\r\nrequires the person to subscribe it in the presence of a consular\r\nofficial, and it must also be signed by this official.[A15-132]\r\n\r\nThough in 1959 Oswald clearly stated to officials at the American\r\nEmbassy, both orally and in writing, that he desired to renounce his\r\nU.S. citizenship, he at no time took the steps required by the statute\r\nand regulations to effect his renunciation. Oswald did not execute the\r\nproper forms, he did not sign his letter of October 31 or November\r\n3, 1959, in the presence of a consular official, and neither letter\r\nwas signed by such an official.[A15-133] Because section 349(a)(6) in\r\nterms requires compliance with the form prescribed by the Secretary of\r\nState, Oswald did not expatriate himself under that section.\r\n\r\n_Oath of allegiance to a foreign state._--Section 349(a)(2) of the act\r\nprovides that a U.S. citizen shall lose his nationality by:\r\n\r\n    * * * taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal\r\n    declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or a political\r\n    subdivision thereof.[A15-134]\r\n\r\nIn his letter of October 31, 1959, Oswald wrote: “I affirm that my\r\nallegiance is to the union of Soviet Socialist Republics.”[A15-135]\r\nBoth in this letter and in his letter of November 3, 1959, he stated\r\nthat his application for citizenship in the Soviet Union was pending\r\nbefore the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.[A15-136]\r\n\r\nOswald’s letters no doubt were intended to express allegiance to the\r\nSoviet Union in a manner inconsistent with continued allegiance to\r\nthe United States, as the statute has been held to require.[A15-137]\r\nHowever, since 1940, it has been well established that in order for an\r\noath of allegiance to a foreign state to work an expatriation from the\r\nUnited States, it must be given to an official of the foreign state,\r\nand not to a party unconnected with the foreign state.[A15-138] This\r\nrequirement can be viewed as a necessary corollary of the broader,\r\nbut less clearly established, principle that the oath must be taken\r\nin accord with the requirements of the foreign state.[A15-139]\r\nAlthough Lee Harvey Oswald wrote that his allegiance was to the Soviet\r\nUnion,[A15-140] there is no indication that he had ever actually taken\r\nan oath or declaration or that any such oath was taken before an\r\nofficial of the Soviet Government. He, therefore, did not expatriate\r\nhimself under section 349(a)(2).\r\n\r\n_Employment under the government of a foreign state._--Section\r\n349(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 provides that\r\na U.S. citizen shall lose his nationality by:\r\n\r\n    (a) accepting, serving in, or performing the duties of any\r\n    office, post, or employment under the government of a foreign\r\n    state or a political subdivision thereof, if he has or acquires\r\n    the nationality of such foreign state; or (b) accepting,\r\n    serving in, or performing the duties of any office, post\r\n    of employment under the government of a foreign state or a\r\n    political subdivision thereof, for which office, post, or\r\n    employment an oath, affirmation, or declaration of allegiance\r\n    is required. * * *[A15-141]\r\n\r\nWhile Oswald was employed in a state-owned factory in Minsk, he did\r\nnot acquire Russian nationality, and there is no indication that\r\nhe had to take any oath when he obtained this employment.[A15-142]\r\nFurthermore, prior judicial decisions indicate that merely working\r\nin a government-owned factory does not result in expatriation\r\neven if an oath was required to be taken in connection with such\r\nemployment.[A15-143] Several cases decided under an earlier but\r\nsimilar statutory provision held that where a person took a government\r\njob in order to subsist, such employment was considered involuntary\r\nsince it was based on economic duress, and thus it did not result in\r\nexpatriation.[A15-144] Thus, Oswald did not expatriate himself under\r\nsection 349(a)(4).\r\n\r\nThe Commission therefore concludes that Lee Harvey Oswald had not\r\nexpatriated himself by any acts performed between October 16, 1959,\r\nand May 1962, and concurs in the opinion of the State Department that\r\nhis passport was properly returned to him in July 1961 and properly\r\nreissued in May 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORIZATION FOR MARINA OSWALD TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nNegotiations Between Oswald and the Embassy\r\n\r\nOn July 11, 1961, Oswald and his wife appeared at the Embassy in Moscow\r\nbefore John A. McVickar.[A15-145] Together they executed papers to\r\nset in motion the procedures for her admittance to the United States\r\nas a nonquota immigrant under the provisions applicable to the wife\r\nof an American citizen.[A15-146] The interview was routine. McVickar\r\nasked Marina whether she was a member of any Communist organization\r\nand she replied that she was a member of the Trade Union of Medical\r\nWorkers[A15-147] but she denied she was or ever had been a member of\r\nthe Komsomol,[A15-148] the Communist youth organization, or any other\r\nCommunist organization.[A15-149] Marina Oswald has since admitted to\r\nthe Commission that at one time she was a member of The Komsomol, but\r\nwas expelled, according to her testimony, when it was learned that she\r\nintended to accompany her husband to the United States.[A15-150] The\r\nEmbassy forwarded the papers pertaining to her application to the State\r\nDepartment on August 28, 1961.[A15-151]\r\n\r\nMarina Oswald’s ability to obtain a nonquota immigrant visa depended\r\non the favorable resolution of 3 questions. First, it had to be\r\ndetermined that she was the wife of an American citizen,[A15-152]\r\nwhich depended on whether her husband had expatriated himself. Second,\r\nit was necessary to determine that she was not and had not been\r\naffiliated with a Communist organization on other than an involuntary\r\nbasis.[A15-153] Third, it had to be determined that she was not\r\nlikely to become a public charge after she was admitted to the United\r\nStates.[A15-154] Section 243(g) of the Immigration and Nationality\r\nAct[A15-155] presented a fourth issue. This section of the act\r\nprohibits the issuance of immigrant visas by American Consuls stationed\r\nin countries which have refused to accept or have unduly delayed\r\naccepting the return of persons sought to be deported from the United\r\nStates. The Soviet Union had been designated as such a country in 1953.\r\nHowever, the sanctions of section 243(g) are often waived; and even if\r\nthey were not waived in Marina’s case, she could obtain her visa at\r\nan American Embassy in some other country on her way from the Soviet\r\nUnion to the United States, if she were otherwise entitled to the\r\nvisa.[A15-156]\r\n\r\nIn a despatch dated August 28, 1961, the Embassy requested from the\r\nDepartment a security advisory opinion on Marina Oswald’s application\r\nto enter the United States. The Embassy wrote:\r\n\r\n    A favorable advisory opinion and approval of * * * [Mrs.\r\n    Oswald’s] petition is recommended together with a waiver of the\r\n    sanctions imposed by section 243(g) of the Act. * * *\r\n\r\n    In connection with her employment and her professional\r\n    training, she has been a member of the Soviet Trade Union\r\n    for Medical Workers since 1957. Such membership is routinely\r\n    considered to be involuntary. * * *[A15-157]\r\n\r\nThe Department initiated a check on Marina Oswald with the CIA,\r\nthe FBI, the Department’s own Office of Security, and Passport\r\nOffice.[A15-158] The security check turned up no derogatory information\r\non her, so that in early October 1961 the Department cabled Moscow that\r\nthe available information concerning the applicant established her\r\neligibility to enter the country as a nonquota immigrant.[A15-159]\r\n\r\nThe Department’s decision assumed that prior to obtaining her visa to\r\nenter the United States, Marina Oswald would provide some reasonable\r\nassurance that she was not likely to become a public charge after she\r\nhad arrived there. The Department later encountered some difficulty\r\nin deciding that she had met this requirement. She knew no one in the\r\nUnited States other than the members of her husband’s family, and they\r\nlacked the means to furnish any substantial financial guarantees. After\r\nconsiderable correspondence on the matter with Oswald[A15-160] and with\r\nthe Department,[A15-161] the Embassy decided to accept Oswald’s own\r\naffidavit to support his wife as sufficient assurance that she would\r\nnot become a public charge. The Embassy’s reasons were set forth in a\r\nmemorandum dated March 16, 1962:\r\n\r\n    It appears that * * * [Oswald] can find no one in the United\r\n    States who is able and willing to execute an affidavit of\r\n    support for his wife. Furthermore, Oswald has been able to\r\n    obtain no concrete offer of employment in the United States.\r\n    On the other hand, he is trained in a trade which should make\r\n    him readily employable and he and his family will be able to\r\n    live with his mother in Texas until he has found work and\r\n    become otherwise settled. Taking into consideration the latter\r\n    factors, Oswald’s legal obligation to support his wife, and the\r\n    unusual circumstances of the case which make it difficult for\r\n    Oswald to provide the usual financial evidence, the responsible\r\n    consular officer * * * [is] willing to accept Oswald’s\r\n    unsubstantiated affidavit as sufficient to overcome the public\r\n    charge provisions of the law.[A15-162]\r\n\r\nThe necessity of relying solely upon Oswald’s own affidavit, however,\r\nwas eliminated somewhat later when the Department received an affidavit\r\nof support from the employer of Oswald’s mother in Vernon, Tex.[A15-163]\r\n\r\nBy law the Attorney General must also pass upon an applicant’s\r\neligibility, and this responsibility has been delegated to\r\nthe District Directors of the Immigration and Naturalization\r\nService.[A15-164] The machinery to get approval of the Immigration\r\nand Naturalization Service for Marina Oswald’s admission to the\r\nUnited States was set in motion on October 6, 1961. On that date the\r\nVisa Office of the Department of State sent a letter to the District\r\nDirector of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Dallas, Tex.,\r\nrequesting the Service to take action on her immigrant visa.[A15-165]\r\nThe letter transmitted her marriage certificate, a check for $10 from\r\nLee Harvey Oswald, and a “Petition to Classify Status of Alien For\r\nIssuance of Immigrant Visa.” The petition was signed by Oswald and was\r\non behalf of Marina, asking that she be classified in “the status of\r\nthe alien beneficiary for issuance of an immigrant visa as * * * the\r\nspouse of a United States citizen.”[A15-166] The letter from the Visa\r\nOffice stated:\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Oswald has been the object of an investigation by the\r\n    Department and has been found, in the Department’s opinion, not\r\n    ineligible to secure a visa.[A15-167]\r\n\r\nOn the basis of this communication, the Immigration and Naturalization\r\nService at its Dallas, Tex., office instituted a field investigation\r\non Lee Harvey Oswald.[A15-168] Routine checks with the Federal\r\nSecurity agencies and with local law enforcement authorities turned\r\nup no new derogatory information, and no evidence was uncovered that\r\nOswald was ever a member of the Communist Party or other subversive\r\ngroups.[A15-169] A record check was made in New Orleans, La., and a\r\nbirth certificate was found for Lee Harvey Oswald, proving that he\r\nwas an American citizen by birth.[A15-170] On October 17, 1961, an\r\ninvestigator from the Dallas office interviewed Oswald’s brother,\r\nRobert, who expressed the view that Lee was just a “mixed up kid” who\r\nhad emigrated to Russia because he had become embittered, possibly over\r\nsomething that had happened while he was in the Marine Corps.[A15-171]\r\n\r\nOn January 25, 1962, the results of the field investigation in\r\nDallas were consolidated in a report[A15-172] which, with a covering\r\nmemorandum,[A15-173] was sent to the District Director of the Service\r\nin San Antonio the next day. The accompanying memorandum noted that the\r\nimmigrant inspector who processed the case had endorsed it “approved,”\r\nbut the author of the memorandum overruled the decision of the\r\ninspector on the grounds that the sanctions under section 243(g) should\r\nnot be waived.[A15-174] The reasons for denying the waiver were stated\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    OI [Operations Instructions] 205.3, as you know, provides that\r\n    the District Director may waive sanctions in an individual\r\n    meritorious case for a beneficiary of a petition filed by a\r\n    reputable relative where no substantial derogatory security\r\n    information is developed. I am of the opinion that both of\r\n    these restrictions are present in this case.[A15-175]\r\n\r\nOn January 30, 1962, the District Director at San Antonio affirmed\r\nthe decision of the Dallas office, including the decision that the\r\nsanctions imposed under section 243(g) not be waived.[A15-176] He\r\nconcluded that Oswald’s recent statements to the American Embassy in\r\nMoscow to the effect that he had learned from his experiences in Russia\r\nwere not sufficient to relieve the doubts which were raised regarding\r\nhis loyalty to the United States by the arrogant, anti-American\r\nstatements he made when he entered Russia in 1959.[A15-177]\r\n\r\nSan Antonio forwarded its decision to Washington in a letter dated\r\nJanuary 31, 1962, in which Marina Oswald’s petition and all the\r\naforementioned memoranda and reports were included.[A15-178] However,\r\nbecause Washington had previously indicated its impatience at not\r\nyet having received anything on the Oswald case, the San Antonio\r\noffice also telegraphed its decision to Washington about a week\r\nlater,[A15-179] the telegram, presumably being received by Washington\r\nbefore the letter of January 31. The Washington copy of this telegram\r\nhas a handwritten note on the lower portion which indicates that on\r\nFebruary 12 an officer in the Visa Office of the State Department\r\ninformed the Immigration and Naturalization Service by telephone:\r\n“Political desk of opinion, we’re better off with subject in U.S. than\r\nin Russia.”[A15-180]\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the Washington office of the Service concurred in the\r\nfield decision that the provisions of section 243(g) should not be\r\nwaived.[A15-181] However, the Washington office pointed out that the\r\ncorrect disposition should be not to deny the visa petition as the\r\nfield offices had proposed, but to grant the petition and indorse it to\r\nread, “Waiver of sanctions imposed under section 243(g) of the Act is\r\nnot authorized.”[A15-182]\r\n\r\nOn February 28, 1962, the Dallas office of the Immigration and\r\nNaturalization Service notified the Department of State in Washington\r\nand the American Embassy in Moscow of this disposition. The\r\ncommunication from the Dallas office noted that Oswald “has been\r\nnotified at his Minsk, Russia, address of the approval of the petition\r\nin his wife’s behalf.”[A15-183] Oswald later told the Embassy that he\r\nhad received the notice on March 15.[A15-184] On March 9, 1962, the\r\nDepartment of State also notified the Embassy in Moscow that Oswald’s\r\nwife was entitled to nonquota status but that the Immigration and\r\nNaturalization Service would not waive section 243(g) of the Act. The\r\nEmbassy was told to inform Oswald of this fact if he asked about it.\r\nThe memorandum indicated that the Embassy might suggest that Marina\r\ncould proceed to some other country to file her visa application and\r\nthus avoid the sanction.[A15-185]\r\n\r\nThe Moscow Embassy on March 16, 1962, asked the Embassy at Brussels if\r\nMrs. Oswald could obtain her visa in Brussels.[A15-186] The Brussels\r\nEmbassy replied affirmatively and said a visa could be issued to Marina\r\nwithin 2 or 3 days of her arrival.[A15-187] The Marina Oswald file\r\naccordingly was sent to the Embassy at Brussels.[A15-188]\r\n\r\nThe plan to obtain the visa in Belgium was rendered unnecessary,\r\nhowever, when the Immigration and Naturalization Service reversed its\r\nposition regarding the waiver of section 243(g). On March 16, the\r\nSoviet desk at the Department of State took initial action to attempt\r\nto secure such a change by sending a memorandum to the Visa Office\r\nwithin the Department, urging that the Immigration and Naturalization\r\nService be asked to reconsider its decision.[A15-189] According to this\r\nmemorandum:\r\n\r\n    SOV believes it is in the interest of the U.S. to get Lee\r\n    Harvey Oswald and his family out of the Soviet Union and on\r\n    their way to this country as soon as possible. An unstable\r\n    character, whose actions are entirely unpredictable, Oswald may\r\n    well refuse to leave the USSR or subsequently attempt to return\r\n    there if we should make it impossible for him to be accompanied\r\n    from Moscow by his wife and child.\r\n\r\n    Such action on our part also would permit the Soviet Government\r\n    to argue that, although it had issued an exit visa to Mrs.\r\n    Oswald to prevent the separation of a family, the United States\r\n    Government had imposed a forced separation by refusing to issue\r\n    her a visa. Obviously, this would weaken our Embassy’s position\r\n    in encouraging positive Soviet action in other cases involving\r\n    Soviet citizen relatives of U.S. citizens.[A15-190]\r\n\r\nSoon thereafter, however, the Department of State notified its Moscow\r\nEmbassy that the decision was under review and instructed it to\r\nwithhold action pending the outcome of the reconsideration.[A15-191]\r\n\r\nThe Visa Office first contacted the Washington office of the\r\nImmigration and Naturalization Service informally, and was advised,\r\naccording to a contemporaneous notation:\r\n\r\n    * * * that case had been carefully considered and decision made\r\n    at Assistant or Deputy Associate Commissioner level. Therefore,\r\n    although not wishing to comment on likelihood of reversal, [INS\r\n    officer] felt that any letter requesting a review of the case\r\n    should come from the Director or Acting Administrator.[A15-192]\r\n\r\nOn March 27, 1962, such a letter was written from an acting\r\nadministrator in the Department of State to the Commissioner of\r\nImmigration and Naturalization. The letter read in part:\r\n\r\n    I appreciate the difficulty this case presents for your\r\n    Service, because of Mr. Oswald’s background, and the fact that\r\n    granting a waiver of the sanction makes it appear that this\r\n    Government is assisting a person who is not altogether entitled\r\n    to such assistance. However, if the Embassy at Moscow is unable\r\n    to issue Mrs. Oswald a visa, it would appear that she and\r\n    indirectly the Oswalds’ newborn child are being punished for\r\n    Mr. Oswald’s earlier indiscretions. I might also point out that\r\n    this Government has advanced Mr. Oswald a loan of $500.00 for\r\n    repatriation.\r\n\r\n    More important, however, is the possibility that if Mrs. Oswald\r\n    is not issued a visa by the Embassy, the Soviet Government\r\n    will be in a position to claim that it has done all it can to\r\n    prevent the separation of the family by issuing Mrs. Oswald the\r\n    required exit permission, but that this Government has refused\r\n    to issue her a visa, thus preventing her from accompanying her\r\n    husband and child. This would weaken the Embassy’s attempts to\r\n    encourage positive action by the Soviet authorities in other\r\n    cases involving Soviet relatives of United States citizens.\r\n\r\n    Because of these considerations and because I believe it is\r\n    in the best interests of the United States to have Mr. Oswald\r\n    depart from the Soviet Union as soon as possible, I request\r\n    that the section 243(g) sanction be waived in Mrs. Oswald’s\r\n    case.[A15-193]\r\n\r\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service ultimately reversed its\r\noriginal position and granted the waiver on May 9, 1962. The letter\r\nreversing its initial decision states that the matter has been\r\n“carefully reviewed in this office” and that “in view of the strong\r\nrepresentations” made in the letter of March 27, the sanctions imposed\r\npursuant to section 243(g) were thereby waived in behalf of Mrs.\r\nOswald.[A15-194]\r\n\r\nActually, the Office of Soviet Affairs had informally learned on\r\nMay 8 that the May 9 letter would be signed by the Immigration and\r\nNaturalization Service.[A15-195] On the strength of the assurance\r\nthat a written reversal would be forthcoming immediately, the State\r\nDepartment quickly telegraphed the Moscow Embassy reporting that\r\nthe waiver had been granted.[A15-196] Marina Oswald completed her\r\nprocessing when she, her husband, and daughter came to Moscow in May\r\n1962 on their way from Minsk to the United States.[A15-197]\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Justification for the Decisions Affecting Marina Oswald\r\n\r\n_Wife of a citizen of the United States._--Section 205 of the\r\nImmigration and Nationality Act of 1952 provides for the admission into\r\nthe United States of persons married to American citizens.[A15-198]\r\nOnce it was determined that Lee Harvey Oswald was born in the United\r\nStates[A15-199] and had not expatriated himself, his American\r\ncitizenship was established. Marina Oswald submitted a marriage\r\ncertificate to show that she was his wife.[A15-200] This requirement\r\nwas, therefore, satisfied.\r\n\r\n_Assurance that Marina Oswald would not become a public\r\ncharge._--Section 212(a)(15) of the act provides that aliens will not\r\nbe admitted to the United States if, in the opinion of the responsible\r\nGovernment official, they “are likely at any time to become public\r\ncharges.”[A15-201] The pertinent Department of State regulations\r\nprovide that a determination to exclude an alien for this reason must\r\nbe “predicated upon circumstances which indicate that the alien will\r\nprobably become a charge upon the public after entry into the United\r\nStates.”[A15-202]\r\n\r\nIn 1962, Oswald was 22 years old and in good health. He had lived\r\nin the United States for 17 years before joining the Marine Corps\r\nand was, therefore, familiar with its language and customs. He had\r\ngained job experience by working 2½ years in a factory which produced\r\nelectronic equipment. Under these circumstances the Department was not\r\nunreasonable in concluding that Oswald’s own affidavit that he would\r\nsupport his wife was sufficient assurance that she was not likely\r\nto become a charge upon the public after her entry into the United\r\nStates. The receipt of the affidavit from Marguerite Oswald’s employer\r\nprovided a possible alternative basis for reaching this decision, but\r\nsince a favorable ruling had already been made on the basis of Oswald’s\r\naffidavit, the Embassy had no reason to consider the sufficiency of the\r\nsecond affidavit.\r\n\r\n_Membership in a Communist organization._--Under section 212(a) (28) of\r\nthe Immigration and Nationality Act, an alien will not be admitted to\r\nthe United States if he is or was a member of, or affiliated with, a\r\nCommunist organization unless:\r\n\r\n    * * * such an alien establishes to the satisfaction of the\r\n    consular officer when applying for a visa and the consular\r\n    officer finds that (i) such membership or application is or\r\n    was involuntary, or is or was solely when under sixteen years\r\n    of age, by operation of law, or for purposes of obtaining\r\n    employment, food rations, or other essentials of living and\r\n    where necessary for such purposes * * *[A15-203]\r\n\r\nAt the time Marina Oswald applied for a visa she was a member of the\r\nSoviet Trade Union for Medical Workers.[A15-204] According to the\r\nDepartment of State, the\r\n\r\n    * * * long-standing interpretation [of the statute] concurred\r\n    in by the State and Justice Departments [is] that membership\r\n    in a professional organization or trade union behind the Iron\r\n    Curtain is considered involuntary unless the membership is\r\n    accompanied by some indication of voluntariness, such as active\r\n    participation in the organization’s activities or holding an\r\n    office in the organization.[A15-205]\r\n\r\nSince there was no evidence that Marina Oswald actively participated in\r\nthe union’s activities or held an office in the organization, her union\r\nmembership was properly held not to bar her admission to this country.\r\n\r\nAlthough Marina Oswald declared that she was not a member of the\r\nKomsomol or any other Communist organization, she was in fact a member\r\nof the Komsomol, the Communist youth organization.[A15-206] If this\r\nfact had been known to the State Department, Marina Oswald would not\r\nnecessarily have been denied a visa, although a careful investigation\r\ninto the nature of the membership would have been required.[A15-207]\r\nHowever, had her membership in the Komsomol become known to the\r\nDepartment after her denial of such membership, it is possible that she\r\nwould have been excluded from the United States on the ground of having\r\nwillfully misrepresented a material fact.[A15-208]\r\n\r\nJudicial decisions are not in agreement as to what constitutes\r\na “material fact” such that its intentional misrepresentation\r\nwarrants exclusion of the alien.[A15-209] Some cases indicate that a\r\nmisrepresentation in an application for a visa involves a material\r\nfact even if the alien would not definitely have been excluded on the\r\ntrue facts;[A15-210] others hold that a misstatement is material only\r\nif it referred to such facts as would have justified refusing the visa\r\nhad they been disclosed.[A15-211] The Visa Office of the Department of\r\nState has announced that it applies a “rule of probability” under which\r\na misstatement will be deemed material only if it concealed facts which\r\nprobably would have resulted in a denial of a visa.[A15-212]\r\n\r\n_Waiver of the provisions of section 243(g)._--Section 243(g) of the\r\nImmigration and Nationality Act of 1952, by its terms, prevented\r\nissuance of a visa to Marina Oswald by the Moscow Embassy. The section\r\nprovides that upon notification of the Secretary of State by the\r\nAttorney General that a country has refused or unduly delayed the\r\nacceptance of a deportable alien from the United States who is a\r\nsubject or was a resident of that country, consular officers in such\r\ncountry are not to issue visas to citizens of the country. The section\r\nhad been invoked against Russia on May 26, 1953. Nonetheless, although\r\nsection 243(g) does not contain an express provision for waiver, the\r\nJustice Department has concluded that the Attorney General possesses\r\nsuch waiver powers.[A15-213] Pursuant to this decision, the Department\r\nhas granted waivers in over 600 cases from the Soviet Union since\r\n1953.[A15-214] The waiver procedures followed in 1962 were prescribed\r\nby the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The relevant provision\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n    Before adjudicating a petition for an eligible beneficiary\r\n    residing in the USSR, Czechoslovakia or Hungary, against which\r\n    sanctions have been imposed, the district director shall obtain\r\n    a report of investigation regarding the petitioner which shall\r\n    include an affiliation of a subversive nature disclosed by a\r\n    neighborhood investigation, local agency records and responses\r\n    to Form G-135a. * * * If no substantial derogatory security\r\n    information is developed, the district director may waive the\r\n    sanctions in an individual meritorious case for a beneficiary\r\n    of a petition filed by a reputable relative to accord status\r\n    under Section 101(a)(27) (A) or Section 203(a) (2), (3)\r\n    or (4). * * * If substantial adverse security information\r\n    relating to the petitioner is developed, the visa petition\r\n    shall be processed on its merits and certified to the regional\r\n    commissioner for determination whether the sanctions should be\r\n    waived. The assistant commissioner shall endorse the petition\r\n    to show whether the Waiver is granted or denied, and forward it\r\n    and notify the appropriate field office of the action taken. *\r\n    * *[A15-215]\r\n\r\nState Department regulations are much less explicit.[A15-216] The State\r\nDepartment’s visa instructions for the guidance of consular officers\r\nprovide, “The sanctions will be waived only in individual meritorious\r\ncases in behalf of a beneficiary of a petition filed by a reputable\r\nrelative pursuant to [sections] of the act.”[A15-217]\r\n\r\nBecause Lee Harvey Oswald signed the petition on Marina’s behalf, his\r\ncharacter was relevant to whether the sanctions of section 243(g) could\r\nbe waived for her. The file on Lee Harvey Oswald which was maintained\r\nby the Department of State and made available to the Department of\r\nJustice for purposes of passing on his wife’s application contained the\r\nfacts relating to Oswald’s attempted expatriation. However, despite\r\nthe derogatory material in the Oswald file, the Immigration and\r\nNaturalization Service regulations did not require automatic denial of\r\nthe waiver; they provided only that if adverse security information\r\nwere developed, “the visa petition shall be processed on its merits and\r\ncertified to the regional commissioner for determination whether the\r\nsanctions should be waived.” This procedure was followed in Marina’s\r\ncase and the factors considered in reaching the decision do not appear\r\nto be inappropriate. The State Department successfully urged that the\r\noriginal decision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service be\r\nreversed because this would be in the best interests of future United\r\nStates dealings with the Soviet Union on behalf of American citizens,\r\nand because it seemed unfair to punish Lee Harvey Oswald’s wife and\r\nbaby for his own earlier errors.[A15-218] Prevention of the separation\r\nof families is among the most common reasons underlying the frequent\r\nwaivers of section 243(g).[A15-219]\r\n\r\n\r\nOSWALD’S LETTER TO SENATOR TOWER\r\n\r\nSometime shortly before January 26, 1962, an undated letter from Lee\r\nHarvey Oswald was received in the office of the U.S. Senator from\r\nTexas, John G. Tower.[A15-220] The letter reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    My name is Lee Harvey Oswald, 22, of Fort Worth up till October\r\n    1959, when I came to the Soviet Union for a residenaul stay. I\r\n    took a residenual document for a non-Soviet person living for\r\n    a time in the USSR. The American Embassy in Moscow is familier\r\n    with my case\r\n\r\n    Since July 20th 1960, I have unsucessfully applied for a\r\n    Soviet Exit Visa to leave this country, the Soviets refuse to\r\n    permit me and my Soviet wife, (who applied at the U.S. Embassy\r\n    Moscow, July 8, 1960 for immigration status to the U.S.A.) to\r\n    leave the Soviet Union. I am a citizen of the United States\r\n    of America (passport No. 1733242, 1959) and I bessech you,\r\n    Senator Tower, to rise the question of holding by the Soviet\r\n    Union of a citizen of the U.S., against his will and expressed\r\n    desires.[A15-221]\r\n\r\nThe letter was read in Senator Tower’s office by a caseworker on his\r\nstaff. According to the caseworker and the Senator’s press secretary,\r\nthe letter was forwarded as a matter of routine on January 26 to\r\nthe Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations, Department of\r\nState. The letter was forwarded with a cover letter, machine signed\r\nby the Senator, stating that he did “not know Oswald, or any of the\r\nfacts concerning his reasons for visiting the Soviet Union; nor what\r\naction, if any, this Government can or should take on his behalf.” The\r\ncover letter pointed out that Oswald’s inquiry should have gone to the\r\nexecutive branch of the Government and that for this reason the Senator\r\nwas forwarding it “for whatever action the Department may consider\r\nappropriate.”[A15-222] On February 1 an officer at the Department\r\nof State telephoned the Senator’s office and spoke briefly with the\r\ncaseworker on the Oswald case. She made a memorandum of the call which\r\nnotes, “Senator should not become involved in such case--therefore\r\nState will report to us the course which they follow regarding Lee\r\nHarvey Oswalt [sic].”[A15-223] About a week later the Department of\r\nState forwarded to Senator Tower copies of some of the correspondence\r\nwhich the Department had had with Oswald and informed the Senator that\r\nif he wished to be kept informed on further developments regarding\r\nOswald he could contact the Department of State.[A15-224] Neither the\r\nSenator nor any member of his staff contacted the Department again nor\r\ndid they take any other action in respect to the matter.[A15-225]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOAN FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated January 5, 1962, Oswald said that he would like\r\nto make arrangements for a loan from the Embassy or some private\r\norganization for part of the airplane fares.[A15-226] The Embassy\r\non February 6, 1962, replied that he would have to supply certain\r\npersonal and financial data.[A15-227] The letter also said that after\r\nrepatriation he would not be furnished a passport for travel abroad\r\nuntil he had repaid the money.\r\n\r\nBetween February 6, 1962, and May 1, 1962, Oswald attempted to secure\r\na loan from the Red Cross[A15-228] and the International Rescue\r\nCommittee[A15-229] in the United States. The State Department on\r\nFebruary 1 wrote Oswald’s mother a letter asking whether she could\r\nadvance the money.[A15-230] Oswald later wrote both his mother and\r\nthe Department advising each that his mother should not be bothered\r\nin reference to the loan.[A15-231] Ultimately, after an exchange\r\nof communications between the Embassy and Washington,[A15-232] the\r\nDepartment approved a loan to Oswald for passage to New York only,\r\ndirecting the Embassy to “Keep cost minimum.”[A15-233] On June 1 Oswald\r\nsigned a promissory note for $435.71.[A15-234]\r\n\r\nStatutory authority for making such a loan was conferred by title 5,\r\nsection 170(a), of the U.S. Code, which authorizes the Secretary of\r\nState to “make expenditures, from such amounts as may be specifically\r\nappropriated therefor, for unforeseen emergencies arising in the\r\ndiplomatic and consular service.” Since 1947, the Department of State’s\r\nannual appropriation act has included a sum for expenses necessary “to\r\nenable the Secretary of State to meet unforeseen emergencies arising in\r\nthe Diplomatic and Consular Service. * * *”[A15-235] In recent years,\r\nthe accompanying reports submitted by the Appropriations Committee of\r\nthe House of Representatives have stated, “These funds are used for\r\nrelief and repatriation loans to the U.S. citizens abroad and for other\r\nemergencies of the Department.”[A15-236] Out of the amount appropriated\r\nto meet unforeseen emergencies arising in the Diplomatic and Consular\r\nService, the Secretary of State has annually allotted approximately\r\n$100,000 to meet the expenses of indigent U.S. nationals, including\r\nthose in the Soviet Union, who request repatriation loans. From 1959 to\r\n1963, 2,343 such loans were granted.[A15-237]\r\n\r\nSection 423.2-1 of the Department’s regulations provides that\r\nrepatriation loans may be granted only to destitute U.S. nationals:\r\n\r\n    a. Who are in complete and unquestioned possession of their\r\n    citizenship rights;\r\n\r\n    b. Who are entitled to receive United States passports;\r\n\r\n    c. Whose loyalty to the United States Government is beyond\r\n    question, or to whom the provisions of Section 423.1-2(b)\r\n    apply.[A15-238]\r\n\r\nOswald undoubtedly satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (a) and\r\n(b), since he was determined to have been a U.S. citizen at the time\r\nthe loan was granted and he had been issued a passport to return to\r\nthe United States. There is a serious question whether he could have\r\nqualified under the first clause of paragraph (c). The Commission is\r\nof the opinion that in its application of this clause the Department\r\nshould exercise great care in determining whether an applicant’s\r\nloyalty to the U.S. Government is beyond question, particularly in\r\nthe case of a defector like Oswald who has expressed hostility and\r\ndisloyalty to our government and manifested a desire to renounce his\r\ncitizenship. The Department chose instead to exercise its judgment\r\nunder the second clause of paragraph (c), which refers to section\r\n423.1-2(b). This section provides that loans to destitute nationals are\r\nauthorized when:\r\n\r\n    b. The United States national is in or the cause of a\r\n    situation which is damaging to the prestige of the United\r\n    States Government or which constitutes a compelling reason for\r\n    extending assistance to effect his return.[A15-239]\r\n\r\nThe Department decided that the provisions of section (b) were\r\napplicable to Oswald because his “unstable character and prior\r\ncriticism of the United States” would make his continued presence\r\nin the Soviet Union damaging to the prestige of the United\r\nStates.[A15-240] In acting under this section, the Department was\r\nacting within its competence and the law. As required by another\r\nsection of the regulations, the Department sought to obtain funds for\r\nthe Oswalds’ repatriation from private sources--his mother and the\r\nInternational Rescue Committee--before using Government funds.[A15-241]\r\n\r\nRegulations further provide that repatriation loans are authorized\r\nfor the alien, wife, and children of the U.S. national receiving a\r\nrepatriation loan in order to avoid the division of families.[A15-242]\r\nHowever, loans are limited\r\n\r\n    To the minimum amount required to cover transportation and\r\n    subsistence while enroute to the nearest continental United\r\n    States port. * * * When necessary, loans may include: expenses\r\n    incident to embarkation, such as fees for documentation and\r\n    minimum subsistence from the date of application for a loan to\r\n    the date of departure by the first available ship. * * * The\r\n    cost of transportation shall be limited to third-class passage\r\n    by ship.[A15-243]\r\n\r\nOswald’s loan was sufficient to cover no more than the least expensive\r\ntransportation from Moscow to New York. His passport was stamped as\r\nvalid only for return to the United States.[A15-244] Oswald completed\r\nall necessary forms and affidavits to obtain the loan.[A15-245]\r\n\r\nAccording to its own procedures the Department of State should have\r\nprepared a lookout card for Oswald in June 1962 when he received the\r\nproceeds of the loan.[A15-246] The promissory note which he signed\r\ncontained a provision stating,\r\n\r\n    I further understand and agree that after my repatriation I\r\n    will not be furnished a passport for travel abroad until my\r\n    obligation to reimburse the Treasurer of the United States is\r\n    liquidated.[A15-247]\r\n\r\nHowever, a lookout card was never in fact prepared. With respect to\r\nthis failure the State Department has informed the Commission as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    On receipt of notice of the loan from the Embassy in Moscow,\r\n    the Department’s procedures provided that Miss Leola B.\r\n    Burkhead of the Revenues and Receipts Branch of the Office\r\n    of Finance should have notified the Clearance Section in the\r\n    Passport Office of Oswald’s name, date, and place of birth. If\r\n    the Passport Office received only the name and not the date\r\n    and place of birth of a borrower, it would not have prepared\r\n    a lookout card under its established procedures because of\r\n    lack of positive identification. (Among the Passport Office’s\r\n    file of millions of passport applicants, there are, of course,\r\n    many thousands of identical names.) Mr. Richmond C. Reeley was\r\n    the Chief of the Revenues and Receipts Branch of the Office\r\n    of Finance and Mr. Alexander W. Maxwell was Chief of the\r\n    Clearance Section. If the notice was received in the Clearance\r\n    Section it would have been delivered to the Carding Desk for\r\n    preparation of a lookout card on Oswald. It appears, however,\r\n    that such a lookout card was not prepared. It may have been\r\n    that the Finance Office did not notify the Clearance Section\r\n    of Oswald’s loan. One reason for this might have been the\r\n    Finance Office’s lack of information concerning Oswald’s date\r\n    and place of birth. On the other hand, the Finance Office may\r\n    have notified the Clearance Section of Oswald’s name only, in\r\n    which case this Section would not have prepared a lookout card\r\n    under its procedures. Since Oswald began repaying the loan in\r\n    installments immediately after his return to the United States,\r\n    it is also possible that the Office of Finance decided that it\r\n    was unnecessary to pursue the matter further. In any event,\r\n    Oswald’s loan was repaid in full on January 29, 1963, five\r\n    months prior to his application for a new passport.[A15-248]\r\n\r\n\r\nOSWALD’S RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES AND REPAYMENT OF HIS LOAN\r\n\r\nOn June 1, 1962, the some day that Oswald received his loan from the\r\nState Department, he and his family left Moscow by train destined for\r\nRotterdam, The Netherlands.[A15-249] They boarded the SS _Maasdam_ at\r\nRotterdam on June 4 and arrived in New York on June 13, 1962.[A15-250]\r\nThe Embassy sent word of the Oswalds’ departure to the Department of\r\nState in Washington on May 31.[A15-251] Consistent with its prior\r\npractice of keeping the Federal security agencies informed of Oswald’s\r\nactivity,[A15-252] the Department notified the FBI.[A15-253]\r\n\r\nFrederick J. Wiedersheim, an officer of the Immigration and\r\nNaturalization Service in New York, interviewed the Oswalds upon their\r\nentry into the United States at Hoboken, N.J., on June 13, 1962, but\r\nmade no written report. Mr. Wiedersheim recalled that he asked the\r\nOswalds various questions which would determine the eligibility of both\r\nOswald and Marina to enter the United States. The questions included\r\nwhether Oswald had expatriated himself and whether Marina belonged to\r\nany Communist organization which would bar her entry. These questions\r\nwere answered in ways which did not appear to raise any problems and\r\ntherefore the Oswalds were admitted.[A15-254]\r\n\r\nAfter his reentry, Oswald repaid his loan without having to be reminded\r\nby the Department to do so. The early payments were very small because\r\nhe first repaid the approximately $200 he had borrowed from his brother\r\nRobert to apply against the expenses of his travel from New York to\r\nFort Worth, Tex.[A15-255] The schedule of payments is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Aug. 13, 1962          $10.00\r\n  Sept. 5, 1962            9.71\r\n  Oct. 10, 1962           10.00\r\n  Nov. 19, 1962           10.00\r\n  Dec. 11, 1962          190.00\r\n  Jan. 9, 1963           100.00\r\n  Jan. 29, 1963          106.00\r\n     Total      [A15-256]435.71\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUANCE OF A PASSPORT IN JUNE 1963\r\n\r\nOn June 24, 1963, Oswald applied for a U.S. passport at the Passport\r\nOffice in New Orleans, La.[A15-257] He said he was planning to visit\r\nEngland, France, Holland, U.S.S.R., Finland, Italy, and Poland, and\r\nthat he intended to leave the country sometime during November or\r\nDecember 1963 by ship from New Orleans.[A15-258] He stated further\r\nthat he was married to a person born in Russia who was not an American\r\ncitizen. For occupation, the word “Photographer” was inserted on the\r\napplication.[A15-259]\r\n\r\nOn the same day a teletype was sent to Washington containing the names\r\nof 25 of the persons who applied for passports on that date in New\r\nOrleans, Oswald’s name among them. On the right side of the Washington\r\nPassport Office copy of the teletype message, approximately parallel to\r\nhis name, are the letters, “NO,” written in red pencil.[A15-260] Oswald\r\nwas issued a passport on June 25, 1963.[A15-261]\r\n\r\nSince there was no lookout card on Oswald, the passport was processed\r\nroutinely. Twenty-four hours is the usual time for routinely granted\r\npassports to be issued.[A15-262] The handwritten notation, “NO,”\r\nwhich appeared beside Oswald’s name on the list of applicants from\r\nNew Orleans, is a symbol for the New Orleans Passport Office that is\r\nroutinely placed on incoming teletype messages by anyone of a group\r\nof persons in the teletype section of the Passport Office.[A15-263]\r\nNo one looked at Oswald’s file previously established with the\r\nDepartment.[A15-264] The Department, however, has informed the\r\nCommission that at the time the passport was issued there was no\r\ninformation in its passport or security files which would have\r\npermitted it to deny a passport to Oswald.[A15-265] No lookout card\r\nshould have been in the file based upon the Moscow Embassy’s memorandum\r\nof March 28, 1960, which drew attention to Oswald’s intention to\r\nexpatriate himself, because the subsequent determination that Oswald\r\nhad not expatriated himself would remove expatriation as a possible\r\nground for denying him a passport.[A15-266] And by January 29, 1963,\r\nthe repatriation loan had been repaid, so a lookout card should not\r\nhave been in the file on that basis.[A15-267]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOswald was entitled to receive a passport in 1963 unless he came\r\nwithin one of the two statutory provisions authorizing the Secretary\r\nof State to refuse to issue it.[A15-268] Section 6 of the Subversive\r\nActivities Control Act of 1950, which has recently been declared\r\nunconstitutional,[A15-269] then provided:\r\n\r\n    * * * it shall be unlawful for any member of [an organization\r\n    required to register], with knowledge or notice that such\r\n    organization is so registered and that such order has become\r\n    final--(1) to make application for passport, or the renewal of\r\n    a passport, to be issued or renewed by or under the authority\r\n    of the United States; or (2) to use or attempt to use any such\r\n    passport.[A15-270]\r\n\r\nPursuant to section 6, the State Department promulgated a regulation\r\nwhich denied passports to\r\n\r\n    * * * any individual who the issuing officer knows or has\r\n    reason to believe is a member of a Communist Organization\r\n    registered or required to be registered under Section 7 of the\r\n    Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 as amended.[A15-271]\r\n\r\nSince there is no evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald was a member of the\r\nAmerican Communist Party or any other organization which had been\r\nrequired to register under section 7 of the Subversive Activities\r\nControl Act,[A15-272] a passport could not have been denied him under\r\nsection 6.\r\n\r\nSection 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides that, while\r\na Presidential proclamation of national emergency is in force,\r\n\r\n    * * * it shall, except as otherwise provided by the President,\r\n    * * * be unlawful for any citizen of the United States to\r\n    depart from or enter * * * the United States unless he bears a\r\n    valid passport.[A15-273]\r\n\r\nBecause a proclamation of national emergency issued by President Truman\r\nduring the Korean war had not been revoked by 1963, the Government has\r\ntaken the position that the statute remains in force.[A15-274] Pursuant\r\nto section 215, the State Department has issued regulations setting\r\nforth the circumstances under which it will refuse a passport:\r\n\r\n    In order to promote and safeguard the interests of the United\r\n    States, passport facilities, except for direct and immediate\r\n    return to the United States, shall be refused to a person when\r\n    it appears to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State that\r\n    the person’s activity abroad would: (a) violate the laws of\r\n    the United States; (b) be prejudicial to the orderly conduct\r\n    of foreign relations; or (c) otherwise be prejudicial to the\r\n    interests of the United States.[A15-275]\r\n\r\nThe State Department takes the position that its authority under\r\nthis regulation is severely limited. In a report submitted to the\r\nCommission, the Department concluded that “there were no grounds\r\nconsonant with the passport regulations to take adverse passport\r\naction against Oswald prior to November 22, 1963.”[A15-276] Although\r\nOswald’s statement in 1959 that he would furnish the Russians with\r\ninformation he had obtained in the Marine Corps may have indicated\r\nthat he would disclose classified information if he possessed any\r\nsuch information, there was no indication in 1963 that he had any\r\nvaluable information.[A15-277] Moreover, Oswald’s 1959 statement had\r\nbeen brought to the attention of the Department of the Navy[A15-278]\r\nand the FBI[A15-279] and neither organization had initiated criminal\r\nproceedings. The Department therefore had no basis for concluding that\r\nOswald’s 1959 statement was anything more than rash talk.[A15-280] And\r\nthe State Department’s files contained no other information which might\r\nreasonably have led it to expect that Oswald would violate the laws of\r\nthe United States when he went abroad.\r\n\r\nThe most likely ground for denying Oswald a passport in 1963, however,\r\nwas provided by subsection (c) of the regulation quoted above, which\r\nrequires the denial of a passport when the Secretary of State is\r\nsatisfied that the applicant’s “activity abroad would * * * otherwise\r\nbe prejudicial to the interests of the United States.” In 1957 the\r\nState Department described to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\r\none category of persons to whom it denied passports under this\r\nprovision:\r\n\r\n    Persons whose previous conduct abroad has been such as to bring\r\n    discredit on the United States and cause difficulty for other\r\n    Americans (gave bad checks, left unpaid debts, had difficulties\r\n    with police, etc.).[A15-281]\r\n\r\nIn light of the adverse publicity caused the United States by Oswald’s\r\nprior defection to the Soviet Union, he could have been considered\r\na person “whose previous conduct abroad had been such as to bring\r\ndiscredit on the United States.” Indeed, the State Department itself\r\nhad previously been of the opinion that Oswald’s continued presence in\r\nRussia was damaging to the prestige of the United States because of his\r\nunstable character and prior criticisms of the United States.[A15-282]\r\n\r\nHowever, in 1958 the Supreme Court had decided two cases which\r\nrestricted the Secretary of State’s authority to deny passports. In\r\n_Kent_ v. _Dulles_[A15-283] and _Dayton_ v. _Dulles_,[A15-284] the\r\nSupreme Court invalidated a State Department regulation permitting the\r\ndenial of passports to Communists and to those “who are going abroad\r\nto engage in activities which will advance the Communist movement for\r\nthe purpose, knowingly and willfully of advancing that movement,” on\r\nthe ground that the regulation exceeded the authority Congress had\r\ngranted the Secretary. The _Kent_ opinion stressed the importance to be\r\nattached to an individual’s ability to travel beyond the borders of the\r\nUnited States:\r\n\r\n    The right to travel is a part of the “liberty” of which the\r\n    citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the\r\n    Fifth Amendment * * * Freedom of movement across frontiers in\r\n    either direction, and inside frontiers as well, was a part of\r\n    our heritage. Travel abroad, like travel within the country,\r\n    may be necessary for a livelihood. It may be as close to the\r\n    heart of the individual as the choice of what he eats, or\r\n    wears, or reads. Freedom of movement is basic in our scheme of\r\n    values.[A15-285]\r\n\r\nThe _Kent_ opinion also suggested that grounds relating to citizenship\r\nand allegiance to illegal conduct might be the only two upon which the\r\nDepartment could validly deny a passport application.\r\n\r\nThe Department, though publicly declaring that these decisions had\r\nlittle effect upon its broadly worded regulation,[A15-286] in practice\r\ndenied passports only in limited situations. In 1963 the Department\r\ndenied passports only to those who violated the Department’s travel\r\nrestrictions, to fugitives from justice, to those involved in using\r\npassports fraudulently, and to those engaged in illegal activity abroad\r\nor in conduct directly affecting our relations with a particular\r\ncountry.[A15-287] Passports were granted to people who the Department\r\nmight have anticipated would go abroad to denounce the United States,\r\nand to a prior defector.[A15-288] State Department officials believed\r\nthat in view of the Supreme Court decisions, the Department was not\r\nempowered to deny anyone a passport on grounds related to freedom of\r\nspeech or to political association and beliefs.[A15-289]\r\n\r\nSince Oswald’s citizenship was not in question and since there was\r\nno indication that he would be involved in illegal activity abroad,\r\nthe only grounds upon which a passport might have been denied Oswald\r\nwould have fallen within the area of speech or political belief and\r\nassociation. The Commission therefore concludes that the Department was\r\njustified in granting a passport to Oswald on June 25, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT TO THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY\r\n\r\nIn October 1963, the Passport Office of the State Department received\r\na report from the Central Intelligence Agency that Oswald had visited\r\nthe Soviet Embassy in Mexico City.[A15-290] The report said nothing\r\nabout Oswald’s having visited the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, a fact\r\nwhich was not known until after the assassination. Upon receipt of the\r\ninformation the passport file on Lee Harvey Oswald was reviewed by the\r\nPassport Office.[A15-291] The CIA communication and the passport file\r\nwere read by an attorney and a supervisory attorney in that office\r\nwho found no basis for revoking Oswald’s passport or for notifying\r\nthe FBI or CIA that Oswald had been issued a new passport in June\r\n1963.[A15-292] The Department has informed the Commission that, “since\r\nthe report indicated no grounds for determining Oswald was ineligible\r\nfor a passport, a determination was made that no action by the passport\r\noffice was required.”[A15-293] Travel to Russia was not proscribed\r\nin 1963. Moreover, the Soviet Union was one of the countries Oswald\r\nhad listed on his passport application. Hence, the Commission agrees\r\nthat Oswald’s taking steps to enter the Soviet Union in 1963 was not a\r\nsufficient reason to revoke his passport.\r\n\r\nLater, on November 14, 1963, the FBI sent the Department a report on\r\nOswald’s arrest in New Orleans, La. during August in connection with\r\na fistfight in which he became engaged when passing out pamphlets\r\nentitled “Hands Off Cuba.” No action was taken on the basis of the\r\nBureau’s report.[A15-294] The Commission agrees that this incident was\r\nnot grounds for revoking Oswald’s passport.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nInvestigation of Oswald’s complete dealings with the Department of\r\nState and the Immigration and Naturalization Service reveals no\r\nirregularity suggesting any illegal actions or impropriety on the\r\npart of government officials. The Commission believes, however, that\r\nin applying its own regulations the Department should in all cases\r\nexercise great care in the return to this country of defectors such\r\nas Oswald who have evidenced disloyalty or hostility to this country\r\nor who have expressed a desire to renounce their U.S. citizenship and\r\nthat, when such persons are returned, procedures should be adopted\r\nfor the better dissemination of information concerning them to the\r\nintelligence agencies of the Government. The operation of the “lookout\r\ncard” system in the Department of State was obviously deficient,\r\nbut since these deficiencies did not affect Oswald or reflect any\r\nfavoritism or impropriety, the Commission considers them beyond the\r\nscope of its inquiry.\r\n\r\nEspecially while he was in the Soviet Union, Oswald’s manner to\r\nGovernment personnel was frequently insulting and offensive. As one\r\n1962 communication between the Embassy and the Department of State\r\nobserved, “It is not that our hearts are breaking for Oswald. His\r\nimpertinence knows no bounds.”[A15-295] Nonetheless, the officials of\r\nthe U.S. Government respected Oswald as a troubled American citizen and\r\nextended to him the services and assistance for which the agencies\r\nof government have been created. Though Oswald was known to be “an\r\nunstable character, whose actions are highly unpredictable,”[A15-296]\r\nthere was no reasonable basis in 1961 and 1962 for suspecting that upon\r\nhis readmittance to the country he would resort to violence against\r\nits public officials. The officers of the Department of State and\r\nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service, acting within the proper\r\nlimits of their discretion, concluded that Oswald’s return to the\r\nUnited States was in the best interests of the country; it is only from\r\nthe vantage of the present that the tragic irony of their conclusion\r\nemerges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XVI\r\n\r\nA Biography of Jack Ruby\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this appendix the Commission presents a biography of Jack Ruby.\r\nAlthough criminal proceedings involving its subject are pending in\r\nthe State of Texas, the Commission has decided to include this rather\r\ndetailed account of Ruby’s life and activities for several reasons.\r\nMost importantly, the Commission believes it will permit a better\r\nevaluation of the evidence on the question whether Ruby was involved\r\nin any conspiracy. Furthermore, the Commission believes that in view\r\nof the many rumors concerning Ruby the public interest will be served\r\nby an account which attempts to give sufficient material to provide an\r\nimpression of his character and background. The Commission’s desire\r\nnot to interfere in the pending proceedings involving Ruby necessarily\r\nlimits the scope of this appendix, which does not purport to discuss\r\nthe legal issues raised during Ruby’s trial or his possible motive for\r\nshooting Oswald.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nJack Ruby, born Jacob Rubenstein, was the fifth of his parents’ eight\r\nliving children. There is much confusion about his exact birth date.\r\nSchool records report it as June 23, April 25,[A16-1] March 13, and,\r\npossibly, March 3, 1911.[A16-2] Other early official records list his\r\ndate of birth as April 21 and April 26, 1911.[A16-3] During his adult\r\nlife the date Ruby used most frequently was March 25, 1911.[A16-4]\r\nHis driver’s license, seized following his arrest, and his statements\r\nto the FBI on November 24, 1963, listed this date.[A16-5] However,\r\nthe police arrest report for November 24 gave his birth date as March\r\n19, 1911.[A16-6] Since the recording of births was not required in\r\nChicago prior to 1915, Ruby’s birth may never have been officially\r\nrecorded.[A16-7] No substantial conflict exists, however, about whether\r\nJack Ruby was born in 1911.[A16-8]\r\n\r\nRuby has one older brother and three older sisters. The oldest\r\nchildren, Hyman and Ann, were born shortly after the turn of\r\nthe century,[A16-9] before their parents arrived in the United\r\nStates.[A16-10] The other children were born in Chicago. Ruby’s sister\r\nMarion was born in June 1906[A16-11] and his sister Eva in March\r\n1909.[A16-12] Ruby also has two younger brothers and a younger sister.\r\nSam was born in December 1912,[A16-13] Earl in April 1915.[A16-14] The\r\nyoungest child, Eileen, was born in July 1917.[A16-15] At least one and\r\npossibly two other children died during infancy.[A16-16]\r\n\r\nJack Ruby’s father, Joseph Rubenstein, was born in 1871 in Sokolov,\r\na small town near Warsaw, Poland, then under the rule of Czarist\r\nRussia.[A16-17] He entered the Russian artillery in 1893.[A16-18]\r\nThere he learned the carpentry trade, which had been practiced by his\r\nfather and at least one brother[A16-19] and he picked up the habit\r\nof excessive drinking that was to plague him for the rest of his\r\nlife.[A16-20] While in the army,[A16-21] he married Jack’s mother,\r\nFannie Turek Rutkowski;[A16-22] the marriage was arranged, as was\r\ncustomary, by a professional matchmaker.[A16-23] According to his\r\noldest son, Joseph Rubenstein served in China, Korea, and Siberia,\r\ndetesting these places and army life. Eventually, in 1898, he simply\r\n“walked away” from it and about 4 years later he went to England and\r\nCanada, entering the United States in 1903.[A16-24]\r\n\r\nSettling in Chicago, Joseph Rubenstein joined the carpenters union in\r\n1904 and remained a member until his death in 1958.[A16-25] Although\r\nhe worked fairly steadily until 1928, he was unemployed during the\r\nlast 30 years of his life.[A16-26] The only other group which Joseph\r\nRubenstein joined consisted of fellow immigrants from Sokolov. His\r\ndaughter Eva described this group as purely social and completely\r\nnonpolitical.[A16-27]\r\n\r\nJack Ruby’s mother, Fannie Rubenstein, was probably born in 1875 near\r\nWarsaw, Poland.[A16-28] She followed her husband to the United States\r\nin 1904 or 1905, accompanied by her children Hyman and Ann.[A16-29]\r\nAn illiterate woman, she went to night school in about 1920 to learn\r\nhow to sign her name.[A16-30] She apparently failed in this endeavor,\r\nhowever, for an alien registration form, filed after about 35 years\r\nin the United States, was signed by an “X”.[A16-31] Although she\r\napparently learned some English, her speech was predominantly Yiddish,\r\nthe primary language of the Rubenstein household.[A16-32] Still, Mrs.\r\nRubenstein felt strongly that her children required an education in\r\norder to better themselves. She frequently argued about this with\r\nher husband, who had received little, if any, formal education and\r\nfirmly believed that grammar school training was sufficient for his\r\nchildren.[A16-33]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHILDHOOD AND YOUTH (1911-33)\r\n\r\nIn 1911, when Jack Ruby was born, his family resided near 14th\r\nand Newberry Streets in Chicago, the first in a series of\r\nJewish neighborhoods in which the Rubensteins lived during his\r\nchildhood.[A16-34] In 1916, the Rubensteins lived at 1232 Morgan\r\nStreet, where they apparently remained until 1921.[A16-35] This was\r\nthe fourth residence in the first 5 years of Jack Ruby’s life.[A16-36]\r\nEarl Ruby described one typical neighborhood in which the family lived\r\nas a “ghetto” with “pushcarts on the streets.”[A16-37] His sister\r\nEva characterized it as “below the middle class but yet it wasn’t\r\nthe poorest class.”[A16-38] The family generally lived near Italian\r\nsections, where there were frequent fights along ethnic lines.[A16-39]\r\n\r\nThe Rubenstein home was marked by constant strife and the parents\r\nwere reported to have occasionally struck each other.[A16-40] Between\r\n1915 and 1921, Joseph Rubenstein was frequently arrested because\r\nof disorderly conduct and assault and battery charges, some filed\r\nby his wife.[A16-41] In the spring of 1921, Jack Ruby’s parents\r\nseparated.[A16-42] In 1937 Mrs. Rubenstein reported that she had\r\ndesired a divorce 15 years earlier, but her husband had been opposed to\r\nit.[A16-43] The predominant causes of the separation were apparently\r\nJoseph Rubenstein’s excessive drinking and Fannie Rubenstein’s\r\nuncontrollable temper. She resented her numerous pregnancies, believed\r\nher husband to be unfaithful, and nagged him because he failed to make\r\nenough money.[A16-44]\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychiatric Report\r\n\r\nYoung Jack soon showed the effects of parental discord. On June 6,\r\n1922, at the age of 11, he was referred to the Institute for Juvenile\r\nResearch by the Jewish Social Service Bureau. The reason for the\r\nreferral was “truancy and incorrigible at home.”[A16-45] On July 10,\r\n1922, the institute recommended to the bureau that Jack be placed in a\r\nnew environment where his characteristics might be understood and where\r\nhe might be afforded the supervision and recreation that would end his\r\ninterest in street gangs.[A16-46] In March 1923, the institute advised\r\nthe bureau that “placement in a home, where intelligent supervision and\r\ndiscipline can be given” was appropriate.[A16-47]\r\n\r\nThe institute’s psychiatric examination, which served as a basis for\r\nthese recommendations, took place in 1922, prior to the advent of\r\nmany techniques and theories of modern psychiatry,[A16-48] but it\r\nis the most objective evidence of Jack Ruby’s childhood character.\r\nAccording to the psychiatric report, Jack was “quick tempered” and\r\n“disobedient.”[A16-49] He frequently disagreed openly with his mother,\r\nwhom he considered an inferior person with whose rules he did not have\r\nto comply.[A16-50] Jack told the institute’s interviewer that he ran\r\naway from home because his mother lied to him and beat him.[A16-51]\r\nAlthough Mrs. Rubenstein was severe with her children, she was\r\ndescribed as totally incapable of coping with them “because of their\r\ndelinquencies, i.e., principally their destructive tendencies and\r\ndisregard for other people’s property.”[A16-52] His mother’s “extreme\r\ntemperament” and quarrelsomeness were cited as possible causes of\r\nJack’s “bad behavior.”[A16-53]\r\n\r\nSelf-administered questionnaires revealed that Jack felt his classmates\r\nwere “picking” on him and that he could not get along with his\r\nfriends.[A16-54] They also indicated that, although Jack described\r\nhimself as a good ballplayer, he did not belong to any clubs and\r\nwas not a member of any athletic teams.[A16-55] Jack’s psychiatric\r\ninterviewer reported:\r\n\r\n    He could give no other good reason for running away from\r\n    school except that he went to amusement parks. He has some sex\r\n    knowledge and is greatly interested in sex matters. He stated\r\n    that the boys in the street tell him about these things. He\r\n    also claims that he can lick everyone and anybody in anything\r\n    he wants to do.[A16-56]\r\n\r\nThe interviewer noted that during “mental tests” he reacted quickly,\r\noften carelessly, and his attention was apt to wander so that he had to\r\nbe reprimanded.[A16-57]\r\n\r\nA letter recommending the boy’s placement in a more wholesome\r\nenvironment stated:\r\n\r\n    He is egocentric and expects much attention, but is unable\r\n    to get it as there are many children at home. His behavior\r\n    is further colored by his early sex experiences, his great\r\n    interest [in sex] and the gang situation in the street. From a\r\n    superficial examination of his mother who was here with him,\r\n    it is apparent that she has no insight into his problem, and\r\n    she is thoroughly inadequate in the further training of this\r\n    boy.[A16-58]\r\n\r\nRecognizing that the sketchiness of the case record precluded complete\r\ndiagnosis, Dr. Raymond E. Robertson, currently the superintendent of\r\nthe institute, reported nonetheless that it seems “firmly established\r\n* * * [that] his unstable and disorganized home could not provide Jack\r\nwith the necessary controls and discipline.”[A16-59]\r\n\r\n\r\nPlacement in Foster Homes\r\n\r\nOn July 10, 1923, a dependency hearing involving Jack, his younger\r\nbrothers Sam and Earl, and his sister Eileen, was held in Chicago’s\r\njuvenile court.[A16-60] The petition alleged that the children were not\r\nreceiving proper parental care. They had, until then, been in their\r\nmother’s custody, living on Roosevelt Road, the border between Jewish\r\nand Italian districts.[A16-61] The juvenile court made a finding of\r\ndependency. It appointed the Jewish Home Finding Society guardian with\r\nthe right to place the children in foster homes, and it ordered Joseph\r\nRubenstein to pay the court clerk $4 per week for the support of each\r\nchild. On November 24, 1924, this order was vacated, which apparently\r\nsignified the termination of the guardianship and the return of the\r\nchildren to their mother. On April 8, 1925, the case was continued\r\n“generally,” meaning that it was inactive but could be reactivated if\r\nthe court so desired.[A16-62]\r\n\r\nDespite court records, the exact circumstances and length of time\r\nthat Jack Ruby lived away from home are not entirely clear. Records\r\nindicate that Jack, Sam, Earl, and Eileen Rubenstein were wards of the\r\nJewish Home Finding Society “for a short time in 1922-23.”[A16-63]\r\nHowever, Jack and Eileen stated they spent about 4 or 5 years in\r\nfoster homes.[A16-64] Earl testified that he and Sam were originally\r\nsent to a private foster home and then lived on a farm for a little\r\nmore than a year, while Jack was on a different farm “some distance\r\naway.” Subsequently the three brothers lived together in another foster\r\nhome.[A16-65]\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequent Home Life\r\n\r\nWhen Jack Ruby returned to his family, the unit was still disordered.\r\nHis father remained apart from the children at least until 1936 and\r\nperhaps until a few years later.[A16-66] Mrs. Rubenstein’s inability to\r\nmanage her home, which had been reported by the Institute for Juvenile\r\nResearch in 1922, apparently continued. For example, in 1937 Marion\r\nRubenstein observed that her mother “has never been any kind of a\r\nhousekeeper, was careless with money, and never took much interest in\r\nthe children’s welfare * * * she was selfish, jealous, disagreeable,\r\nand never cared to do anything in the home but lie around and\r\nsleep.”[A16-67] Dr. Hyman I. Rubenstein, the son of Joseph Rubenstein’s\r\nbrother, recalled that Jack Ruby’s mother ran “an irregular household”\r\nand appeared to be “a rather disturbed person of poor personal\r\nappearance with no incentive for cleaning or cooking.”[A16-68]\r\n\r\nMrs. Rubenstein’s domestic shortcomings were accompanied by symptoms\r\nof mental disease. In about 1913, 2 years after Jack was born, Mrs.\r\nRubenstein began to develop a delusion that a sticking sensation in\r\nher throat was caused by a lodged fishbone.[A16-69] Each month Hyman,\r\nher oldest child, took her to a clinic. And each month the examining\r\ndoctor, finding no organic cause for discomfort, informed her that\r\nthere was nothing in her throat and that the sensation was but a\r\nfigment of her imagination. According to Hyman, this practice continued\r\nfor a number of years until Mrs. Rubenstein tired of it.[A16-70]\r\n\r\nIn 1927, Mrs. Rubenstein once again began to visit clinics in\r\nconnection with her fishbone delusion. Three years later, a\r\nthyroidectomy was performed, but she subsequently said it did nothing\r\nto relieve her discomfort.[A16-71] According to the Michael Reese\r\nHospital, whose clinic she had visited since 1927, Mrs. Rubenstein was\r\nsuffering from psychoneurosis with marked anxiety state.\r\n\r\nBy order of the county court of Cook County, Mrs. Rubenstein was\r\ncommitted to Elgin State Hospital on July 16, 1937.[A16-72] She was\r\nparoled on October 17, 1937, 3 months after her commitment.[A16-73] On\r\nJanuary 3, 1938, the Chicago State Hospital informed Elgin State that\r\nthe family desired that she be readmitted to the mental hospital. The\r\nfamily reported that she was uncooperative, caused constant discord,\r\nwas very noisy, and used obscene language.[A16-74] A State social\r\nworker observed that Mrs. Rubenstein refused ever to leave the house,\r\nexplaining that her children would have thrown her things out had she\r\nleft. Mrs. Rubenstein rebuffed a suggestion by the social worker that\r\nshe help with the dishes by stating that she would do nothing as long\r\nas her “worthless” husband was in the house.[A16-75] She was readmitted\r\non January 14, 1938.[A16-76]\r\n\r\nMrs. Rubenstein was again paroled on May 27, 1938, and was discharged\r\nas “improved” on August 25, 1938.[A16-77] She stayed in an apartment\r\nwith Marion, and her separation from the rest of the family apparently\r\nended most of the difficulties.[A16-78] Subsequently, Jack Ruby’s\r\nparents were apparently reconciled, since their alien registration\r\nforms, filed in late 1940, indicated that they both resided at Marion’s\r\naddress.[A16-79]\r\n\r\nFannie Rubenstein was admitted to Michael Reese Hospital on April 4,\r\n1944, as a result of a heart ailment. Her condition was complicated\r\nby an attack of pneumonia and she died at the hospital on April 11,\r\n1944.[A16-80] Hyman testified that, perhaps because she favored the\r\neducation of her children and they recognized her difficulties in\r\nrearing them during a turbulent marriage, they all remembered Mrs.\r\nRubenstein with warmth and affection.[A16-81] The evidence also\r\nindicates that Jack, notwithstanding his earlier attitudes, became\r\nespecially fond of his mother.[A16-82] Following his wife’s death,\r\nJoseph Rubenstein stayed with the children in Chicago, where he died at\r\nthe age of 87, on December 24, 1958.[A16-83]\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n\r\nRecords provided by the Chicago Board of Education revealed that Jack\r\nRuby attended Smyth Grammar School from October 24, 1916, through\r\nthe 1920-21 term, completing kindergarten to grade 4B.[A16-84] He\r\nrepeated the third grade.[A16-85] During the 1921-22 school year Jack\r\nfinished the fourth grade at the Clarke School; he attended Schley\r\nSchool for the 1924-25 term, when he completed the sixth grade. Ruby’s\r\nrelationship with the Institute for Juvenile Research and the Jewish\r\nHome Finding Society may explain the lack of academic records for the\r\n1922-23 and 1923-24 school years. While there is some uncertainty\r\nabout Ruby’s education subsequent to September 1925,[A16-86] it seems\r\nlikely that he completed the eighth grade in 1927, when he was 16.\r\nAlthough Jack Ruby and others have stated that he attended at least 1\r\nyear of high school,[A16-87] the Chicago Board of Education could not\r\nlocate any record of Ruby’s attending Chicago high schools.[A16-88]\r\nConsidering the absence of academic records and Jack’s apathetic\r\nattitude toward school,[A16-89] the Commission deems it unlikely that\r\nhis education extended into high school.\r\n\r\nRecords of the Institute for Juvenile Research revealed that, as of\r\nJune 1922, Ruby had no religious education outside the public school\r\nsystem.[A16-90] However, according to their children, Jack’s parents\r\nmade some effort to inculcate in them a desire to adhere to the tenets\r\nof Orthodox Judaism. Jewish dietary and festival laws were observed\r\nand several of the children accompanied Joseph Rubenstein to the\r\nsynagogue.[A16-91] Earl Ruby stated that all the boys received some\r\nHebrew school training until the breakup of the Rubenstein home in\r\n1921.[A16-92] However, Hyman Rubenstein testified that the instability\r\nand economic necessities of the household and the children’s\r\nrelationships outside the home frustrated the religious efforts of\r\nRuby’s parents.[A16-93]\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities\r\n\r\nBorn in a home that disintegrated when he was 10 and boasting no\r\nsubstantial educational background, Jack Ruby early found himself on\r\nChicago streets attempting to provide for himself and other members of\r\nhis family. An avid sports fan, he, together with many of his friends,\r\n“scalped” tickets to various sporting events.[A16-94] He also sold\r\nnumerous novelty items and knickknacks, particularly those connected\r\nwith professional and collegiate athletics. Even in his youth, Ruby\r\ndeclined to work on a steady basis for someone else.[A16-95]\r\n\r\nAccording to his brother Hyman, Jack Ruby’s only legal difficulty as\r\na youth resulted from an altercation with a policeman about ticket\r\nscalping. Hyman, then active in local politics, was able to have\r\ncharges arising out of the incident dropped.[A16-96] Ruby has indicated\r\nthat during the depression he served a short jail sentence for the\r\nunauthorized sale of copyrighted sheet music.[A16-97]\r\n\r\nThe only other member of the Rubenstein family who appears to have had\r\nany difficulty with the law while a youth was Hyman. On May 1, 1916,\r\nChicago’s juvenile court declared Hyman incorrigible, a term covering a\r\nwide range of misbehavior. Because of the absence of informative court\r\nrecords and the lapse of time, the misconduct that occasioned this\r\nproceeding could not be ascertained, but Hyman is not known to have\r\nencountered subsequent difficulty.[A16-98] Some of Ruby’s childhood\r\nfriends eventually became criminals;[A16-99] however, Hyman Rubenstein,\r\nhis sister Mrs. Eva Grant, and virtually all of Ruby’s friends and\r\nacquaintances who were questioned reported that he was not involved\r\nwith Chicago’s criminal element.[A16-100]\r\n\r\nThe evidence indicates that young Jack was not interested in political\r\naffairs.[A16-101] Hyman was the only Rubenstein to participate actively\r\nin politics. Sponsored by various political officials, he became a\r\nsidewalk inspector and warehouse investigator for 8 years. On one\r\noccasion, he obtained a permit for Jack to sell novelties from a\r\npushcart located in a business district during the pre-Christmas buying\r\nrush. Eventually the complaints of enraged businessmen led licensing\r\nauthorities to declare that a mistake had been made and to revoke\r\nRuby’s permit.[A16-102]\r\n\r\n\r\nTemperament\r\n\r\nThe evidence reveals striking differences of opinion among childhood\r\nfriends and acquaintances of Jack Ruby about whether he possessed\r\nviolent tendencies. Many persons stated that he was mild mannered,\r\nquiet, and even tempered.[A16-103] Former welterweight champion\r\nBarney Ross, whom Jack Ruby idolized from the inception of his\r\nboxing career,[A16-104] stated that Ruby was “well behaved,” was\r\nnever a troublemaker, and was never involved with law-enforcement\r\nagencies.[A16-105] Another friend, who became a successful businessman\r\non the west coast, said that, as a youth, Ruby never started fights\r\neven though he was adept with his fists.[A16-106] Other friends\r\ndeclared that he would, if at all possible, avoid clashes.[A16-107]\r\n\r\nBut many other friends and acquaintances recalled that he had a hot\r\ntemper and was quickly moved to violent acts or words.[A16-108] One\r\nfriend explained that in the “tough” Chicago neighborhood where they\r\nlived, self-defense was vitally important and added that Ruby was fully\r\ncapable of defending himself.[A16-109] Another friend described Ruby as\r\nquick tempered and, though unlikely to pick fights, willing to accept\r\nany challenge without regard to the odds against him.[A16-110] Young\r\nJack also interfered in fights, particularly when the person he was\r\naiding appeared to be taking a severe beating or in a disadvantageous\r\nposition.[A16-111] Others reported that he had the reputation of being\r\na good street brawler.[A16-112] One school friend recalled that when\r\nJack argued vehemently about sports, he occasionally used a stick or\r\nother available weapon. He reported, however, that after Ruby’s anger\r\nsubsided, he reverted to his normal, likable character.[A16-113]\r\n\r\nFrom early childhood, Jack Ruby was called “Sparky” by those who knew\r\nhim.[A16-114] According to his sister Eva Grant, the nickname derived\r\nfrom the way Jack wobbled when he walked. He was thought to resemble\r\nthe slow-moving horse called “Sparky” or “Sparkplug” depicted in a\r\ncontemporary comic strip. Mrs. Grant testified that her brother became\r\nincensed when called “Sparky” and that from the time he was about 8\r\nyears old he would strike anyone calling him by that name.[A16-115] A\r\nchildhood friend also recalled that Jack hated the nickname and would\r\nfight when called by it.[A16-116] Mrs. Grant was unsure whether the\r\nnickname “Sparky” did not also result from his quick reaction to the\r\ntaunts of young friends.[A16-117] Hyman Rubenstein thought that the\r\nnickname derived from Jack’s speed, aggressiveness, and quick thinking.\r\nThe many accounts of Ruby’s lightninglike temper lend credence to\r\nthe theory, widely held, that his nickname was connected with his\r\nvolatility.[A16-118]\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG MANHOOD (1933-43)\r\n\r\n\r\nSan Francisco (1933-37)\r\n\r\nJack Ruby reported that in about 1933, he and several Chicago friends\r\nwent to Los Angeles and, shortly thereafter, to San Francisco.[A16-119]\r\nAlthough there is evidence that he stayed there until 1938, 1939,\r\nor 1940,[A16-120] Ruby stated that he returned to Chicago in about\r\n1937,[A16-121] and this appears to have been the case.[A16-122] Eva\r\nGrant testified that Ruby went to the west coast because he believed\r\nemployment would be available there.[A16-123]\r\n\r\nEva, who married Hyman Magid in Chicago in 1930,[A16-124] was divorced\r\nin early 1934, and in about June of that year joined her brother Jack\r\nin San Francisco. She and her son, Ronald, shared an apartment with\r\nhim. In 1936, Eva married Frank Granovsky, also known as Frank Grant,\r\nin San Francisco, and Ruby shared a four-room apartment with them and\r\nRonald for a short while.[A16-125]\r\n\r\n\r\nOccupations and Activities\r\n\r\nRuby stated that when he and his friends arrived in Los Angeles, they\r\nsold a handicapper’s tip sheet for horseraces at Santa Anita racetrack\r\nwhich had just opened.[A16-126] Eva Grant testified that Ruby also\r\nworked as a singing waiter in Los Angeles, but made very little\r\nmoney.[A16-127]\r\n\r\nWhen the group moved to San Francisco, Ruby continued to sell\r\n“tip” sheets at Bay Meadows racetrack.[A16-128] Subsequently, he\r\nbecame a door-to-door salesman of subscriptions to San Francisco\r\nnewspapers.[A16-129] Although there is some evidence that he ultimately\r\nbecame chief of his crew and had several people working under\r\nhim,[A16-130] other reports indicate that this is unlikely.[A16-131]\r\nEva Grant testified that she also sold newspaper subscriptions but was\r\nless proficient than her brother and relied upon him for advice and\r\nsupport.[A16-132]\r\n\r\nAlthough virtually all his San Francisco acquaintances knew Jack Ruby\r\nas “Sparky,”[A16-133] there is no evidence that he engaged in violent\r\nactivities in San Francisco or was reputed to possess a vicious temper.\r\nOne friend, who stated that he resided with Ruby and Eva for about a\r\nyear, described him as a “well-mannered, likable individual who was\r\nsoft spoken and meticulous in his dress and appearance.”[A16-134]\r\nAnother friend described him as a “clean-cut, honest kid,”[A16-135]\r\nand the manager of a crew with which Ruby worked stated that he had a\r\ngood reputation and appeared to be an “honest, forthright person.” The\r\ncrew manager reported that Ruby associated with a sports crowd, some\r\nof whose members were involved with professional boxing, but not with\r\ncriminals. He added that Ruby had a personal liking for law enforcement\r\nand would have wanted to become a police officer had he been larger\r\nphysically.[A16-136]\r\n\r\nOne friend reported that although Ruby always associated with Jewish\r\npeople, he never exhibited great interest in religion.[A16-137] Ruby\r\nmet Virginia Belasco, granddaughter of the prominent playwright and\r\nactor, David Belasco, in about 1936 at a dance at the Jewish community\r\ncenter in San Francisco. Miss Belasco stated that while a teenager she\r\nsaw Ruby socially on several occasions between 1936 and 1941.[A16-138]\r\nThe only other evidence concerning Ruby’s social activities while in\r\nSan Francisco is his statement to his long-time girl friend, Alice\r\nNichols of Dallas,[A16-139] that while in San Francisco he met the\r\nonly other woman, Virginia Fitzgerald or Fitzsimmons, that he ever\r\nconsidered marrying.[A16-140]\r\n\r\n\r\nChicago (1937-43)\r\n\r\nJack Ruby stated that following his return to Chicago, he was\r\nunemployed for a considerable period.[A16-141] However, when his mother\r\nwas admitted to Elgin State Hospital in 1937,[A16-142] she reported\r\nthat he was employed as a “traveling salesman” apparently living away\r\nfrom home.[A16-143] Although there is conflicting evidence about his\r\nability to earn a comfortable living,[A16-144] he apparently was able\r\nto maintain a normal existence[A16-145] and required no financial\r\nassistance from his family or friends. He continued to be a so-called\r\n“hustler,” scalping tickets and buying watches and other small items\r\nfor resale at discount prices.[A16-146] One of his closest Chicago\r\nfriends stated that Ruby’s sales and promotions were “shady” but\r\n“legitimate.”[A16-147]\r\n\r\n_Labor union activities._--Ruby reported that in “about 1937” he\r\nbecame active in Local 20467 of the Scrap Iron and Junk Handlers\r\nUnion.[A16-148] At this time, his friend, attorney Leon Cooke, was\r\nthe local’s financial secretary.[A16-149] Records provided by the\r\nSocial Security Administration indicate that Ruby was employed by the\r\nunion from late 1937 until early 1940;[A16-150] he worked as a union\r\norganizer and negotiated with employers on its behalf.[A16-151]\r\n\r\nOn December 8, 1939, the union’s president, John Martin, shot Cooke,\r\nwho died of gunshot wounds on January 5, 1940; Martin was subsequently\r\nacquitted on the ground of self-defense.[A16-152] Although a Jack\r\nRubenstein is mentioned in the minutes of a union meeting on February\r\n2, 1940,[A16-153] and Ruby is reported to have said after Cooke’s\r\ndeath that he wanted to “take over” the union,[A16-154] the evidence\r\nindicates that Ruby was so upset by Cooke’s death that he was\r\nunable to devote himself further to union activities and left its\r\nemploy.[A16-155] Ruby reported that after Cooke’s death he adopted the\r\nmiddle name “Leon,” which he used only infrequently, in memory of his\r\nfriend.[A16-156]\r\n\r\nSince Ruby was the ultimate source of all but one of these\r\naccounts,[A16-157] other descriptions of Ruby’s separation from the\r\nunion cannot with certainty be deemed inaccurate. These reports\r\nindicated that Ruby might have been forced out of the union by a\r\ncriminal group, or might have left because he lacked the emotional\r\nstability necessary for sucessful labor negotiations[A16-159] or\r\nbecause he felt he was not earning enough money with the union.[A16-160]\r\n\r\nAlthough the AFL-CIO investigated the ethical practices of local 20467\r\nin 1956, placed the local in trusteeship, and suspended Paul Dorfman,\r\nwho succeeded Martin and Cooke, there is no evidence that Ruby’s union\r\nactivities were connected with Chicago’s criminal element.[A16-161]\r\nSeveral longtime members of the union reported that it had a good\r\nreputation when Ruby was affiliated with it[A16-162] and employers\r\nwho negotiated with it have given no indication that it had criminal\r\nconnections.[A16-163]\r\n\r\n_Subsequent employment._--In 1941, Ruby and Harry Epstein organized the\r\nSpartan Novelty Co., a small firm that sold in various northeastern\r\nStates small cedar chests containing candy and gambling devices known\r\nas punchboards.[A16-164] Earl Ruby and two of Jack Ruby’s friends,\r\nMartin Gimpel and Martin Shargol, were also associated in this\r\nventure. The group had no fixed addresses, living in hotels.[A16-165]\r\n\r\nLate in 1941, Jack Ruby returned to Chicago, where he continued his\r\npunchboard business through the mails.[A16-166] Following the December\r\n7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, he and several friends decided to\r\ndesign and sell plaques commemorating the Day of Infamy. However, the\r\nventure was impeded by Ruby’s perfectionistic approach to details of\r\ndesign which resulted in numerous production delays.[A16-167] By the\r\ntime Ruby’s copyrighted plaque [A16-168] was finally ready for sale,\r\nthe market was flooded with similar items.[A16-169] At about this time,\r\nRuby also sold busts of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.[A16-170] In late\r\n1942 and 1943, Ruby was employed by the Globe Auto Glass Co.[A16-171]\r\nand Universal Sales Co.[A16-172]\r\n\r\nAlthough one of Ruby’s acquaintances at this time described him as a\r\ncuckoo nut on the subject of patriotism,[A16-173] the evidence does not\r\nindicate that Ruby’s promotion of “Remember Pearl Harbor” plaques and\r\nRoosevelt busts was motivated by patriotic or political considerations.\r\nRather, the sale of these items was, to Ruby, just another commercial\r\nventure, but he might also have considered these sales “a good\r\nthing.”[A16-174] Numerous friends reported that Ruby had no interest\r\nin political affairs during this period,[A16-175] although he greatly\r\nadmired President Roosevelt.[A16-176]\r\n\r\n_Other activities._--The evidence indicates that Ruby led a normal\r\nsocial life during these years. Virginia Belasco stated that while\r\nRuby was selling punchboards in New York during November 1941, he\r\nentertained her each weekend.[A16-177] Other reports indicate that Ruby\r\nfancied himself a “ladies’ man,” enjoyed dancing, almost always had\r\nfemale accompaniment and was “very gentlemanly” with women.[A16-178]\r\n\r\nRuby, with several friends, frequently attempted to disrupt rallies of\r\nthe German-American Bund.[A16-179] One acquaintance reported that Ruby\r\nwas responsible for “cracking a few heads” of Bund members.[A16-180]\r\nApparently he joined in this activity for ethnic rather than political\r\nreasons. The young men in the group were not organized adherents\r\nof any particular political creed, but were poolhall and tavern\r\ncompanions from Ruby’s Jewish neighborhood who gathered on the spur of\r\nthe moment to present opposition when they learned that the pro-Nazi\r\nand anti-Semitic Bund movement was planning a meeting.[A16-181]\r\nHyman Rubenstein testified that Ruby would fight with any person\r\nmaking derogatory comments about his ethnic origins, and others have\r\nstated that Ruby would fight with anyone he suspected of pro-Nazi or\r\nanti-Semitic tendencies.[A16-182]\r\n\r\nDuring this period Ruby, though temperamental, apparently engaged in\r\nno unusual acts of violence. However, he did interfere on several\r\noccasions when he thought someone was treated unfairly. A friend who\r\ndescribed Ruby as “somewhat overbearing regarding the rights and\r\nfeelings of others,” reported that Ruby fought two college students\r\nwho insulted a Negro piano player.[A16-183] Another friend reported\r\nthat Ruby had a “bitter” fight with a man who was abusing an older\r\nwoman.[A16-184]\r\n\r\nMaintaining his friendship with Barney Ross, and still an ardent\r\nsports fan, Ruby associated with various figures in the boxing world\r\nand regularly attended the fights at Marigold Gardens.[A16-185]\r\nHe frequented the Lawndale Poolroom and Restaurant, a rallying\r\npoint for the anti-Bundists and chief “hangout” of many of Ruby’s\r\nfriends.[A16-186] In addition, Ruby, described as a “health\r\nnut”[A16-187] who earnestly contended that he could hit harder than Joe\r\nLouis,[A16-188] exercised at several athletic clubs.[A16-189]\r\n\r\nDespite Ruby’s participation in “shady” financial enterprises, his\r\nassociation with a labor union subsequently disciplined by the AFL-CIO,\r\nhis participation in violent anti-Bund activities, and his connection\r\nwith a poolroom, the evidence falls short of demonstrating that Ruby\r\nwas significantly affiliated with organized crime in Chicago. Virtually\r\nall of Ruby’s Chicago friends stated he had no close connection\r\nwith organized crime.[A16-190] In addition, unreliable as their\r\nreports may be, several known Chicago criminals have denied any such\r\nliaison.[A16-191] The Commission finds it difficult to attach credence\r\nto a newspaper reporter’s contrary statement that his undisclosed\r\n“syndicate sources” revealed Ruby was connected with organized crime\r\nand confidence games.[A16-192] Ruby was unquestionably familiar, if\r\nnot friendly, with some Chicago criminals,[A16-193] but there is no\r\nevidence that he ever participated in organized criminal activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY ACTIVITIES (1943-46)\r\n\r\nIn September 1941, Jack Ruby was apparently classified 1-A[A16-194]\r\nand declared eligible for the draft. Subsequently he appeared before\r\na local board and was reclassified 1-H or 3-A.[A16-195] Between\r\nAugust 31, 1941, and November 19, 1942, when it was abolished, the\r\n1-H classification applied to registrants who had reached their 28th\r\nbirthday and were, therefore, no longer liable for service.[A16-196]\r\nThe 3-A deferment applies to persons whose entry into military service\r\npresents financial hardship to dependents. Because of the length\r\nof time involved and the destruction of local draft board records,\r\nRuby’s precise status or the reason for his deferment could not be\r\nascertained.[A16-197] According to one somewhat unreliable report,\r\nRuby, immediately prior to his physical examination, feigned a hearing\r\ndisability and occasionally wore a hearing aid.[A16-198] Hyman\r\nRubenstein, who testified that Jack was deferred because of economic\r\nhardship since he was “the only one home,” specifically denied the\r\ntruthfulness of this allegation.[A16-199] Early in 1943, Ruby was again\r\nclassified 1-A, and, following an unsuccessful appearance before his\r\nappeal board, he was inducted into the U.S. Army Air Forces on May 21,\r\n1943.[A16-200] Jack was the last of the Rubenstein brothers to enter\r\nthe service. Previously, Earl had enlisted in the Navy, Sam was in Army\r\nAir Force Intelligence and Hyman was in the field artillery.[A16-201]\r\n\r\nExcept for 5 weeks in Farmingdale, N.Y., Ruby spent his military days\r\nat various airbases in the South.[A16-202] He received the basic\r\ntraining given all recruits and advanced training as an aircraft\r\nmechanic.[A16-203] On August 2, 1943, he passed marksmanship tests\r\nwith the .30 caliber carbine and the .45 caliber submachinegun,\r\nbut failed with the .30 caliber rifle. On February 10, 1944, he\r\nearned a sharpshooter’s rating for his firing of an M1 .30 caliber\r\ncarbine. His character and efficiency ratings, when determined, were\r\nexcellent.[A16-204] After attaining the rank of private first class\r\nand receiving the good conduct medal, Ruby was honorably discharged on\r\nFebruary 21, 1946.[A16-205]\r\n\r\nTwo persons who recalled Ruby while he was in the Army Air Forces\r\nasserted that he was extremely sensitive to insulting remarks about\r\nJews.[A16-206] When, during an argument, a sergeant called Ruby a\r\n“Jew bastard,” Ruby reportedly attacked him and beat him with his\r\nfists.[A16-207]\r\n\r\nThere is conflicting evidence about the zeal with which Ruby performed\r\nhis military duties. One associate indicated that Ruby, who at 34\r\nwas the oldest in his group, always worked harder than the others to\r\nprove that he could keep up with them.[A16-208] Another recalled, by\r\ncontrast, that Ruby had “no liking for work” and carefully avoided\r\nsituations requiring him to dirty his hands.[A16-209] However, there\r\nis no basis in the record for the inference that Ruby was in any way\r\nanti-American.\r\n\r\nRuby frequently expressed to some fellow soldiers his high regard for\r\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt.[A16-210] Two independent sources reported\r\nthat he cried openly when informed of Roosevelt’s death in April\r\n1945.[A16-211] This did not indicate any sudden political interest,\r\nhowever, since none of his known military associates reported such an\r\ninterest, and Ruby’s admiration for President Roosevelt anteceded his\r\nmilitary days.[A16-212]\r\n\r\nWhile in service, Ruby is reported to have continued his promotional\r\nventures. One person recalled that in 1944, Jack received punchboards\r\nand chocolates from someone in Chicago and peddled these items through\r\nthe base to make extra money. This person also indicated that Ruby\r\nenjoyed card and dice games in or near the barracks.[A16-213]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTWAR CHICAGO (1946-47)\r\n\r\nFollowing his discharge from the Army Air Forces in February 1946,\r\nJack Ruby returned to Chicago. He joined his three brothers, who had\r\npreviously been discharged from the service,[A16-214] in the Earl\r\nProducts Co. Earl Ruby testified that he was the sole investor in the\r\nenterprise, but each brother received an equal ownership interest\r\non his return from the service.[A16-215] The company manufactured\r\nand sold small cedar chests and distributed punchboards.[A16-216] In\r\naddition, it made aluminum salt and pepper shakers, key chains, bottle\r\nopeners, screwdrivers, and small hammers.[A16-217] Sam supervised the\r\nmanufacturing end of the business, while Earl managed the office and\r\nadvertising.[A16-218] Jack was in charge of sales, but the company was\r\nsmall and he had no subordinates.[A16-219]\r\n\r\nBecause insufficient profits led to frequent arguments, Hyman soon left\r\nEarl Products.[A16-220] Jack, who stayed with the company through\r\nmost of 1947, had many disputes with his brothers because he insisted\r\non selling the products of other companies, such as costume jewelry,\r\nand he did not like traveling outside the Chicago area. Earl and Sam\r\nfinally purchased Jack’s interest, paying him more than $14,000 in\r\ncash.[A16-221]\r\n\r\nAlthough there is some evidence to the contrary,[A16-222] it is\r\nunlikely that Ruby was in the nightclub business in Chicago during\r\nthe postwar period. Many who have reported this may have mistaken him\r\nfor Harry Rubenstein,[A16-223] who was convicted of manslaughter and\r\noperated several such establishments.[A16-224] None of Jack Ruby’s\r\nclose friends or relatives indicated that he was in the nightclub\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nFollowing his return from the Army, Ruby was described as ready to\r\nfight with any person who insulted Jews or the military.[A16-225]\r\nEarl Ruby testified that on one occasion in 1946, Jack returned from\r\ndowntown Chicago with his suit covered with blood. He explained at that\r\ntime that he had fought with a person who had called him a “dirty Jew\r\nor something like that.”[A16-226]\r\n\r\nOther evidence indicates that Ruby’s personality was not substantially\r\nchanged by his military experience. One person who met him in 1947,\r\nreported that Ruby was a “fashionable” dresser.[A16-227] He continued\r\nto be described as soft spoken,[A16-228] although he was also known\r\nas hot-tempered.[A16-229] Ruby worked out regularly at an athletic\r\nclub,[A16-230] and one friend regarded him as a “Romeo,” who was quite\r\nsuccessful in attracting young women.[A16-231]\r\n\r\n\r\nDALLAS (1947-63)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Move to Dallas\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, Ruby’s sister, Eva Grant, visited Dallas.[A16-232]\r\nHaving operated a restaurant on the west coast and considering\r\nit a lucrative business, she arranged, near the end of 1945, to\r\nlease a building under construction in Dallas, which she ran as a\r\nnightclub.[A16-233] Part of the financing for this establishment, the\r\nSingapore Supper Club, was provided by her brothers. Jack Ruby, who\r\napparently obtained the money from Earl Products, sent $1,100 as a\r\ndownpayment on the lease, Earl contributed about $1,500, and Hyman paid\r\nfor more than $2,000 worth of equipment.[A16-234]\r\n\r\nBefore she opened the Singapore in 1947, Eva Grant engaged in the\r\nsale of metal products.[A16-235] In that year she met Paul Roland\r\nJones, who allegedly was seeking customers for iron pipe and whom she\r\nreferred to Hyman Rubenstein.[A16-236] Jones had, at about that time,\r\nbeen convicted of attempting to bribe the newly elected sheriff of\r\nDallas.[A16-237] On October 24, 1947, he was arrested for violating\r\nFederal narcotics statutes.[A16-238] Jack Ruby had visited Dallas early\r\nin 1947 to help Eva Grant manage the Singapore,[A16-239] and 5 days\r\nafter Jones’ arrest, Jack and Hyman Rubenstein were interrogated in\r\nChicago by agents of the Bureau of Narcotics.[A16-240] The brothers\r\nadmitted knowing Jones but denied awareness of his connection with\r\nnarcotics. During the 2 years in which Jones was appealing his\r\nconviction he and other criminals frequented the Singapore Club, then\r\noperated by Jack Ruby.[A16-241]\r\n\r\nIntensive investigation to determine whether Jack Ruby was criminally\r\nor otherwise connected with Jones’ narcotics violation leads the\r\nCommission to conclude Ruby probably was not involved.[A16-242] A\r\nsearch of the files of the Bureau of Narcotics disclosed no record\r\nthat either Hyman or Jack had been prosecuted by Federal authorities\r\nin 1947.[A16-243] Jack, Hyman, and Eva denied participating in any\r\nnarcotics activities. Jones and his coconspirators also denied\r\nthat Jack was a participant.[A16-244] One of Jones’ confederates\r\nreported after the shooting of Oswald that although Jones\r\n“propositioned” the two brothers concerning narcotics, they refused\r\nto participate.[A16-245] Moreover, when one of the conspirators was\r\narrested with 48 pounds of raw opium in his possession, he implicated\r\nJones and another person, both of whom were convicted, but he did not\r\nimplicate Jack Ruby or his brother.[A16-246]\r\n\r\nLate in 1947, Ruby established permanent residence in Dallas.[A16-247]\r\nShortly after shooting Oswald, Ruby stated that he returned to Dallas\r\nat Eva Grant’s request, to help her operate the Singapore Supper\r\nClub.[A16-248] However, on December 21, 1963, he reported that\r\nalthough association with his sister had been the purpose of his\r\ninitial visit to Dallas, he returned there because of the failure\r\nof his “merchandising deals” in Chicago.[A16-249] These factors, in\r\nconjunction with his separation from Earl Products,[A16-250] probably\r\nmotivated Ruby’s move to Dallas.\r\n\r\nA different reason has been given by Steve Guthrie, former sheriff of\r\nDallas. Guthrie reported that shortly after his election as sheriff in\r\nJuly 1946, Paul Roland Jones, representing other Chicago criminals,\r\noffered him a substantial amount of money to permit them to move in\r\nand manage illegal activities in Dallas. Although he never met Ruby,\r\nGuthrie asserted that these criminals frequently mentioned that\r\nRuby would operate a “fabulous” restaurant as a front for gambling\r\nactivities.[A16-251]\r\n\r\nDespite its source, the Commission finds it difficult to accept this\r\nreport. A member of the Dallas Police Department, Lt. George E. Butler,\r\nwho was present during virtually all the conversations between Guthrie\r\nand Jones and who performed considerable investigative work on the\r\ncase, stated that Ruby was not involved in the bribery attempt and\r\nthat he had not heard of Ruby until the investigation and trial of\r\nJones had been completed. He explained that Ruby’s connection with the\r\ncase stemmed from the fact that, as mentioned previously, Jones and\r\nother criminals frequented the Singapore Supper Club.[A16-252] And 22\r\nrecordings of the conversations between Guthrie, Butler, and Jones\r\nnot only fail to mention Ruby, but indicate that Jones was to bring\r\nfrom outside the Dallas area only one confederate, who was not to be\r\nJewish.[A16-253]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Change of Name\r\n\r\nSometime in 1947, Jack Ruby’s brothers Earl and Sam, pursuant to a\r\njoint understanding, legally changed their names from Rubenstein to\r\nRuby.[A16-254] Earl testified that he changed his name because everyone\r\ncalled him Ruby and because a former employer advised him that it\r\nwas preferable not to use a “Jewish name” on mail orders for Earl\r\nProducts.[A16-255]\r\n\r\nOn December 30, 1947, Jack changed his name to Jack L. Ruby by securing\r\na decree from the 68th Judicial District Court of Dallas. His petition\r\nalleged that he sought the change because the name Rubenstein was\r\nmisunderstood and too long and because he was “well known” as Jack\r\nL. Ruby.[A16-256] The Bureau of Narcotics report of his relationship\r\nwith Paul Roland Jones indicates that as of October 29, 1947, Jack was\r\nknown as Ruby;[A16-257] however, several persons in Dallas knew him as\r\nRubenstein.[A16-258]\r\n\r\n\r\nNightclub Operations\r\n\r\nExcept for a brief period in about 1953, when Ruby managed the Ervay\r\nTheater, a motion picture house,[A16-259] the operation of nightclubs\r\nand dancehalls was his primary source of income, and his basic interest\r\nin life during the 16 years he spent in Dallas prior to shooting\r\nLee Oswald. When Ruby first arrived in Dallas in 1947, he and Eva\r\nGrant jointly managed the Singapore Supper Club.[A16-260] Shortly\r\nthereafter, she returned to the west coast. Except for sporadic trips\r\nto Dallas, she remained there until 1959, leaving Ruby a power of\r\nattorney.[A16-261] Ruby, who had received $14,000 from the sale of his\r\ninterest in Earl Products,[A16-262] invested a substantial amount in\r\nthe club, which Mrs. Grant described as “too nice a club for that part\r\nof town.”[A16-263] Ruby changed the Singapore’s name to the Silver Spur\r\nClub. It was operated primarily as a dancehall, serving beer to its\r\npatrons.[A16-264] In about 1952, Ruby borrowed $3,700 from a friend,\r\nRalph Paul, to purchase the Bob Wills Ranch House[A16-265] with Martin\r\nGimpel, a former associate in the Spartan Novelty Co.[A16-266] The\r\nRanch House was run as a western-type nightclub.[A16-267]\r\n\r\nWith two establishments to run, Ruby experienced substantial financial\r\nreversals in 1952. He abandoned his interest in the Ranch House and, on\r\nJuly 1, 1952, transferred the Silver Spur to Gimpel and Willie Epstein,\r\nwho assumed some of its debts.[A16-268] Disappointed by these setbacks,\r\nRuby stated that he had a “mental breakdown,” and “hibernated” in\r\nthe Cotton Bowl Hotel in Dallas for 3 or 4 months, declining to see\r\nhis friends.[A16-269] Still depressed, he then returned to Chicago,\r\napparently intending to remain there permanently.[A16-270] However, he\r\nstayed only 6 weeks. Gimpel and Epstein were anxious to be rid of the\r\nSilver Spur and Ruby once again became its owner.[A16-271]\r\n\r\nIn 1953, Ruby obtained an interest in the Vegas Club, which he operated\r\nwith Joe Bonds until September 1953.[A16-272] At that time he informed\r\nIrving Alkana, who had retained a prior ownership interest, that he was\r\nunable to meet his obligations with respect to the club. Alkana then\r\nassumed management of the Vegas until June 19, 1954, when, following\r\nnumerous disagreements with him, he sold Ruby his interest.[A16-273]\r\n\r\nRuby still owned the Vegas Club at the time of his arrest on November\r\n24, 1963. However, when Eva Grant returned from San Francisco in 1959,\r\nshe assumed management of the club, receiving a salary but no ownership\r\ninterest.[A16-274] The Vegas, which occasionally featured striptease\r\nacts,[A16-275] employed a dance band and served beer, wine, soft\r\ndrinks, and some prepared foods.[A16-276]\r\n\r\nIn 1954, Ruby’s Vegas associate, Joe Bonds, was convicted of sodomy and\r\nsent to a Texas penitentiary to serve an 8-year sentence.[A16-277] In\r\n1955, Ruby sold the Silver Spur to Roscoe “Rocky” Robinson; however,\r\nRobinson could not obtain a license to operate the club and it was\r\nsubsequently closed.[A16-278] For a few months during this period,\r\nRuby also operated Hernando’s Hideaway, but this venture proved\r\nunsuccessful.[A16-279]\r\n\r\nSam Ruby testified that shortly after he sold his interest in Earl\r\nProducts in mid-1955 and moved to Dallas, he loaned Jack $5,500 to\r\nenable him to pay Federal excise taxes on the Vegas. As security for\r\nthe loan, Sam required Jack to execute a bill of sale of the Vegas.\r\nUpon Jack’s default in payment, Sam instituted suit, claiming that he\r\nowned the Vegas and that Jack had breached his promise to repurchase\r\nit. The case was ultimately settled, with Jack retaining his ownership\r\ninterest in the club.[A16-280]\r\n\r\nIn late 1959, Jack Ruby became a partner of Joe Slatin in establishing\r\nthe Sovereign Club, a private club that was apparently permitted by\r\nTexas law to sell liquor to members.[A16-281] Since Slatin was troubled\r\nabout Dallas news stories describing police raids on a private club\r\nthat permitted gambling, he felt he needed more capital.[A16-282] Ruby\r\ninvested about $6,000 which he borrowed from his brother Earl and\r\nperhaps some of his own money.[A16-283]\r\n\r\nThe Sovereign was described as a “plush” and exclusive club, and\r\nRuby was apparently very anxious to attract a wealthy “carriage”\r\ntrade.[A16-284] The venture was not successful, however. The two men\r\ncould not work together, and Slatin withdrew in early 1960.[A16-285]\r\nRuby turned for new capital to Ralph Paul,[A16-286] who had operated\r\na Dallas club with Joe Bonds.[A16-287] Ruby still owed Paul $1,200 of\r\nthe $3,700 loan made in connection with the Bob Wills Ranch House,\r\nbut Paul advanced him another $2,200, which allowed him to pay the\r\nSovereign’s rent for 4 months. Subsequently, Ruby spontaneously gave\r\nPaul a stock certificate representing 50 percent of the equity of the\r\ncorporation owning the club. Ruby told Paul that if the venture failed,\r\nthe Sovereign’s fixtures and other physical property would belong to\r\nPaul.[A16-288]\r\n\r\nExperiencing difficulty in recruiting sufficient members, Ruby soon\r\nfound himself again unable to pay the Sovereign’s monthly rent of\r\n$550. Again he turned to Paul, who loaned him $1,650 on the condition\r\nthat he change the club’s method of operation. Paul insisted that Ruby\r\ndiscontinue club memberships, even though this would prevent the sale\r\nof liquor, and offer striptease shows as a substitute attraction.\r\nRuby agreed, and the Sovereign’s name was changed to the Carousel\r\nClub.[A16-289] It became one of three downtown Dallas burlesque\r\nclubs[A16-290] and served champagne, beer, “setups” and pizza, its only\r\nfood.[A16-291] The Carousel generally employed four strippers, a master\r\nof ceremonies, an assistant manager, a band, three or four waitresses,\r\nand a porter or handyman.[A16-292] Net receipts averaged about\r\n$5,000 per month,[A16-293] most of which was allocated to the club’s\r\npayroll.[A16-294] Late in 1963, Ruby began to distribute “permanent\r\npasses” to the Carousel;[A16-295] however, the cards were apparently\r\ndesigned solely for publicity and did not affect the club’s legal\r\nstatus.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Relationships\r\n\r\nRuby’s employees displayed a wide range of personal reactions to him.\r\nThose associated with Ruby long enough to grow accustomed to his\r\nviolent temper and constant threats of discharge generally portray him\r\nsympathetically.[A16-296] They reported he was genuinely interested in\r\ntheir welfare and happiness. In addition, many former employees stated\r\nthat he was a pleasant or unobjectionable employer.[A16-297]\r\n\r\nThere is also considerable evidence that Ruby tended to dominate his\r\nemployees, frequently resorted to violence in dealing with them,\r\npublicly embarrassed them,[A16-298] sometimes attempted to cheat them\r\nof their pay,[A16-299] and delayed paying their salaries.[A16-300]\r\nOther employees reported Ruby continually harassed his help,[A16-301]\r\nand used obscene language in their presence.[A16-302] However\r\nhe frequently apologized, sought to atone for his many temper\r\ntantrums,[A16-303] and completely forgot others.[A16-304]\r\n\r\nOne of the many violent incidents that were reported took place\r\nin 1950, when Ruby struck an employee over the head with a\r\nblackjack.[A16-305] In 1951, after his guitarist, Willis Dickerson,\r\ntold Ruby to “go to hell,” Ruby knocked Dickerson to the ground, then\r\npinned him to a wall and kicked him in the groin. During the scuffle,\r\nDickerson bit Ruby’s finger so badly that the top half of Ruby’s left\r\nindex finger was amputated.[A16-306] In approximately 1955, Ruby beat\r\none of his musicians with brass knuckles; the musician’s mouth required\r\nnumerous stitches.[A16-307]\r\n\r\nDuring 1960, Ruby and two entertainers, Breck Wall and Joe Peterson,\r\nentered into an agreement that the performers would produce and star\r\nin a revue at the Sovereign in exchange for a 50-percent interest in\r\nthe club.[A16-308] After performing for 2 months, the entertainers\r\ncomplained that they had received neither a share of the profits nor\r\nevidence of their proprietary interest. Ruby responded by hitting\r\nPeterson in the mouth, knocking out a tooth. The two men left the\r\nSovereign’s employ, but they subsequently accepted Ruby’s apology and\r\nresumed their friendship with him.[A16-309]\r\n\r\nIn September 1962, Frank Ferraro, the Carousel’s handyman, became\r\ninvolved in a dispute at a nearby bar. Ruby told him not to get into\r\na fight, and Ferraro told Ruby to mind his own business. Ruby then\r\nfollowed Ferraro to another club and beat him severely. Ferraro\r\nrequired emergency hospital treatment for his eye, but he decided not\r\nto press charges since Ruby paid for his hospital care.[A16-310] In\r\nMarch 1963, during an argument about wages, Ruby threatened to throw a\r\ncigarette girl down the stairs of the Carousel.[A16-311]\r\n\r\nRuby’s relationship with his employees commanded much of his attention\r\nduring the months preceding the assassination. The Carousel’s\r\ncomparatively high turnover rate[A16-312] and Ruby’s intense desire to\r\nsucceed[A16-313] required him to meet numerous prospective employees,\r\npatrons, and other persons who might help improve his business.\r\n\r\nRuby frequently encountered difficulties with the American Guild\r\nof Variety Artists (AGVA), the union which represented Carousel\r\nentertainers.[A16-314] For several years, starting in about 1961,\r\nhe unsuccessfully sought modification of AGVA’s policy permitting\r\n“amateur” strippers,[A16-315] inexperienced girls paid less than\r\nunion-scale wages,[A16-316] to perform at union houses. Ruby apparently\r\nbelieved his two competitors, the Weinstein brothers, were scheduling\r\namateur shows in a manner calculated to destroy his business.[A16-317]\r\nRuby’s discontent with AGVA grew particularly acute during the late\r\nsummer and early fall of 1963 when, in addition to meeting with AGVA\r\nofficials,[A16-318] he called upon several acquaintances, including\r\nknown criminals, who, he thought, could influence AGVA on his\r\nbehalf.[A16-319] Other problems with AGVA arose because of his policy\r\nof continuous shows, which did not give masters of ceremonies enough\r\ntime off,[A16-320] and his alleged use of AGVA members to mingle with\r\npatrons to promote the consumption of liquor.[A16-321]\r\n\r\nIn June 1963, Ruby visited New Orleans, where he obtained the services\r\nof a stripper known as “Jada,”[A16-322] who became his featured\r\nperformer.[A16-323] Jada and Ruby had numerous contract disputes and\r\nhe was concerned about her high salary, recurrent absenteeism, and\r\ndiminishing drawing power.[A16-324] Moreover, he thought that Jada had\r\ndeliberately exceeded even the Carousel’s liberal standards of decency\r\nin order to cause him to lose his license or to obtain publicity for\r\nherself.[A16-325] On several occasions Ruby excitedly turned off the\r\nspotlights during her act, and at the end of October 1963, he fired\r\nher.[A16-326] However, after Jada sued out a peace bond, she apparently\r\nrecovered a week’s salary from Ruby.[A16-327]\r\n\r\nIn addition to problems with its star stripper, the Carousel was\r\nrequired to employ three masters of ceremonies in rapid succession\r\nfollowing the departure in about September 1963, of Wally Weston, who\r\nworked there about 15 months.[A16-328] And in early November, the band\r\nthat had played at the Vegas Club for about 8 years left the Vegas to\r\naccept the offer of another Dallas club.[A16-329]\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial Data and Tax Problems\r\n\r\nJack Ruby’s pockets and the trunk of his car served as his bank.\r\nWith a few exceptions, Ruby and his clubs rarely employed bank\r\naccounts.[A16-330] Instead, Ruby carried his cash with him, paying the\r\nbulk of his expenses and debts directly out of club receipts.[A16-331]\r\n\r\nDuring the latter half of 1963, the Carousel, the Vegas, and Ruby each\r\nmaintained checking accounts at the Merchants State Bank in Dallas.\r\nBalances of the latter two accounts never exceeded $275. In July\r\n1963, the Carousel’s account had more than $500; after August 8, its\r\nmaximum balance was less than $300. Between May 31 and November 24,\r\n1963, 53 checks were drawn on the three accounts; with the exception\r\nof one check for $129.47, all were for less than $100.[A16-332] He\r\ngenerally purchased cashier’s checks at the Merchants State Bank to\r\npay his monthly rental of $550 for the Carousel and $500 for the\r\nVegas.[A16-333] He also purchased cashier’s checks during the 3 months\r\nprior to the assassination to pay about $1,500 to the Texas State\r\ntreasurer, $110 to Temple Shearith Israel, apparently for Jewish high\r\nholy day tickets, and $60 to the American Society of Authors and\r\nPublishers.[A16-334]\r\n\r\nRecords of the more than 50 banking institutions checked during the\r\ninvestigation of Ruby’s financial affairs[A16-335] revealed that he\r\nhad three other dormant accounts, all with small balances.[A16-336]\r\nTwo safety deposit boxes belonging to Ruby, opened by Texas officials\r\npursuant to search warrants, were empty and unused for more than a year\r\nprior to the assassination.[A16-337] Although Ruby negotiated several\r\nloans at the Merchants State Bank,[A16-338] there is no evidence that\r\nhe was the maker or co-maker of other loans,[A16-339] and, after\r\ninvestigation, the Dallas Police Department found no record that Ruby\r\ncosigned the note of any policeman at any time.[A16-340]\r\n\r\nRuby’s financial records were chaotic. One accountant abandoned efforts\r\nto prepare income tax returns and other financial statements because\r\nof the hopeless disarray of Ruby’s data.[A16-341] The record indicates\r\nthat Ruby was frequently weeks, if not months, late in filing Federal\r\ntax forms and that he held numerous conferences with Internal Revenue\r\nagents who attempted to obtain the delinquent statements.[A16-342]\r\n\r\nRuby encountered serious difficulties with respect to State franchise\r\nand Federal excise and income taxes. The Texas charter of the\r\ncorporation controlling the Sovereign and Carousel clubs was canceled\r\nin 1961, because Ruby failed to pay Texas franchise taxes.[A16-343]\r\nAnd, only after numerous conferences, did Ruby and representatives of\r\nthe Internal Revenue Service reach agreements on installment payments\r\nof various Federal tax liabilities, to which Ruby more or less\r\nadhered.[A16-344]\r\n\r\nRuby’s primary difficulty concerned Federal excise taxes. Advised by\r\nan attorney that the Vegas Club, a dance hall providing food, was not\r\nsubject to Federal excise taxes because it was not a “cabaret,” Ruby\r\ncharged Vegas patrons on the assumption that no excise taxes were due.\r\nHowever, his attorney reported, when Federal courts ruled that dance\r\nhalls providing “incidental” food were subject to excise taxes as\r\n“cabarets,”[A16-345] Ruby became liable to the Federal Government for\r\nmore than 6 years of taxes, amounting, with interest, to almost exactly\r\n$40,000.[A16-346]\r\n\r\nRuby also fell behind on his personal income tax payments. At the time\r\nof his arrest he owed more than $4,400 for 1959 and 1960.[A16-347]\r\nRemittances accompanied his 1961 and 1962 tax forms, the latter\r\nreceived by the office of the Dallas District Director on September\r\n18, 1963.[A16-348] The following table summarizes amounts which Ruby\r\nreported as gross and net income from the Vegas Club from 1956 to 1962;\r\nand the taxes due:[A16-349]\r\n\r\n  _Year_        _Gross income_         _Net income_       _Tax_\r\n   1962           $41,462.77            $5,619.65     [F]$1,217.75\r\n   1961            40,411.00             6,255.29     [F] 1,200.00\r\n   1960            44,482.41             9,703.90         2,221.39\r\n   1959            50,981.95            14,060.86         3,778.17\r\n   1958            37,755.65             3,274.64           586.52\r\n   1957            33,671.60             2,619.52           438.41\r\n   1956            30,695.27             7,437.01         1,527.10\r\n\r\n    [F] Estimated\r\n\r\nOn his income tax forms, Ruby did not itemize personal deductions and\r\nclaimed only his own exemption. For 1962, Ruby reported salary income\r\nof $650 from the corporation controlling the Carousel, and $900 for\r\n1961.[A16-350]\r\n\r\nRuby and officers of the Internal Revenue Service frequently\r\ndiscussed methods of satisfying his large excise and income tax\r\nliability.[A16-351] In 1960, the Government filed tax liens for more\r\nthan $20,000.[A16-352] In November 1962, the Government rejected Ruby’s\r\noffer to pay $8,000 to compromise the assessed taxes of more than\r\n$20,000 because he had not filed returns for other Federal taxes and\r\nhad not paid these taxes as they became due. These other taxes, for\r\nthe period September 1959 through June 1962, amounted to an additional\r\n$20,000.[A16-353] In June 1963, Ruby submitted an offer of $3,000 to\r\ncompromise all past assessments; the offer was not acted upon prior to\r\nNovember 24, 1963.[A16-354]\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Business Ventures\r\n\r\nIn addition to nightclub management and ownership, Ruby participated\r\nin numerous other commercial ventures. He was able to do so primarily\r\nbecause work at the clubs consumed few of his daytime hours. Many\r\nof Ruby’s ventures related to show business, others were somewhat\r\nspeculative promotions; almost all ended unsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nWhile operating the Silver Spur Club, Ruby sold costume jewelry at\r\ndiscount rates,[A16-355] and, in about 1951, he sold sewing machine\r\nattachments at the Texas State Fair.[A16-356] Approximately a year\r\nlater, he managed a talented young Negro boy, “Little Daddy” Nelson.\r\nThe boy appeared at the Silver Spur, the Vegas Club, and the Bob Wills\r\nRanch House. In about 1953 or 1954, Ruby took “Little Daddy” and his\r\nparents to Chicago to obtain a television appearance for him. However,\r\nshortly after their arrival, Ruby was confronted by a second woman\r\nclaiming to be “Little Daddy’s” mother. Upon advice of counsel, Ruby\r\ndecided to abandon the venture.[A16-357]\r\n\r\nIn 1954, Ruby became interested in the sale of pizza crusts to\r\nDallas restaurants.[A16-358] He is also reported to have sold an\r\narthritic preparation[A16-359] and to have manufactured and sold\r\n“Miniron,” a liquid vitamin formula.[A16-360] In about 1958 or\r\n1959, Ruby attempted to build and sell log cabins at a Texas lake\r\nresort.[A16-361] In early 1959, he investigated the possibility of\r\nselling jeeps to Cuba.[A16-362] He is also reported to have furnished\r\nentertainment for a Dallas hotel,[A16-363] to have promoted records\r\nfor musicians[A16-364] and to have sold English stainless steel razor\r\nblades.[A16-365]\r\n\r\nIn October 1963 Ruby assisted the producers of a carnival show, “How\r\nHollywood Makes Movies,” appearing at the Texas State Fair.[A16-366]\r\nAt about this time Ruby also sought to open a new club in Dallas. He\r\nconferred with numerous persons and placed advertisements in Dallas\r\nnewspapers in an attempt to obtain financial backing.[A16-367] Assuming\r\nthat he would be occupied by the new club, Ruby offered his oldest\r\nbrother, Hyman, a managerial post at the Carousel. However, Hyman, who\r\nhad recently lost his sales territory, declined the offer because he\r\nfelt he was too old for the nightclub business.[A16-368]\r\n\r\nRuby unsuccessfully attempted to sell “twistboards,” an exercising\r\ndevice consisting of two square fiberboards separated by ball\r\nbearings. Despite the contrary advice of his brother Earl,[A16-369]\r\nJack ordered several dozen twistboards and had 2,000 promotional\r\nflyers published.[A16-370] He had one of his strippers demonstrate\r\nthe twistboards at the Texas Products Show during the first week of\r\nNovember 1963.[A16-371]\r\n\r\n\r\nArrests and Violations\r\n\r\nBetween 1949 and November 24, 1963, Ruby was arrested eight times by\r\nthe Dallas Police Department. The dates, charges, and dispositions of\r\nthese arrests are as follows:[A16-372] February 4, 1949, Ruby paid a\r\n$10 fine for disturbing the peace. July 26, 1953, Ruby was suspected\r\nof carrying a concealed weapon; however, no charges were filed and\r\nRuby was released on the same day. May 1, 1954, Ruby was arrested for\r\nallegedly carrying a concealed weapon and violating a peace bond; again\r\nno charges were filed and Ruby was released on the same day. December\r\n5, 1954, Ruby was arrested for allegedly violating State liquor laws\r\nby selling liquor after hours; the complaint was dismissed on February\r\n8, 1955.[A16-373] June 21, 1959, Ruby was arrested for allegedly\r\npermitting dancing after hours; the complaint was dismissed on July 8,\r\n1959. August 21, 1960, Ruby was again arrested for allegedly permitting\r\ndancing after hours; Ruby posted $25 bond and was released on that\r\ndate. February 12, 1963, Ruby was arrested on a charge of simple\r\nassault; he was found not guilty February 27, 1963. Finally, on March\r\n14, 1963, Ruby was arrested for allegedly ignoring traffic summonses: a\r\n$35 bond was posted.\r\n\r\nWhen Ruby applied for a beer license in March 1961, he reported that\r\nhe had been arrested “about four or five times” between 1947 and\r\n1953.[A16-374] Between 1950 and 1963, he received 20 tickets for motor\r\nvehicle violations, paying four $10 fines and three of $3.[A16-375]\r\nIn 1956 and 1959, Ruby was placed on 6 months’ probation as a traffic\r\nviolator.\r\n\r\nRuby was also frequently suspended by the Texas Liquor Control Board.\r\nIn August 1949, when he was operating the Silver Spur, he was suspended\r\nfor 5 days on a charge of “Agents--Moral Turpitude.” In 1953 Ruby\r\nreceived a 5-day suspension because of an obscene show, and, in 1954,\r\na 10-day suspension for allowing a drunkard on his premises.[A16-376]\r\nOn February 18, 1954, he was suspended for 5 days because of an obscene\r\nstriptease act at the Silver Spur and for the consumption of alcoholic\r\nbeverages during prohibited hours.[A16-377] On March 26, 1956, Ruby was\r\nsuspended by the liquor board for 3 days because several of his checks\r\nwere dishonored.[A16-378] On October 23, 1961, he received another\r\n3-day suspension because an agent solicited the sale of alcoholic\r\nbeverages for consumption on licensed premises.[A16-379]\r\n\r\n\r\nPolice Associations\r\n\r\nAlthough the precise nature of his relationship to members of the\r\nDallas Police Department is not susceptible of conclusive evaluation,\r\nthe evidence indicates that Ruby was keenly interested in policemen\r\nand their work.[A16-380] Jesse Curry, chief of the Dallas Police\r\nDepartment, testified that no more than 25 to 50 of Dallas’ almost\r\n1,200 policemen were acquainted with Ruby.[A16-381] However, the\r\nreports of present and past members of the Dallas Police Department\r\nas well as Ruby’s employees and acquaintances indicate that Ruby’s\r\npolice friendships were far more widespread than those of the average\r\ncitizen.[A16-382]\r\n\r\nThere is no credible evidence that Ruby sought special favors from\r\npolice officers or attempted to bribe them.[A16-383] Although there is\r\nconsiderable evidence that Ruby gave policemen reduced rates,[A16-384]\r\ndeclined to exact any cover charge from them,[A16-385] and gave them\r\nfree coffee and soft drinks,[A16-386] this hospitality was not unusual\r\nfor a Dallas nightclub operator.[A16-387] Ruby’s personal attachment\r\nto police officers is demonstrated by reports that he attended the\r\nfuneral of at least one policeman killed in action and staged a benefit\r\nperformance for the widow of another.[A16-388] Ruby regarded several\r\nofficers as personal friends, and others had worked for him.[A16-389]\r\nFinally, at least one policeman regularly dated, and eventually\r\nmarried, one of the Carousel’s strippers.[A16-390]\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderworld Ties\r\n\r\nFrom the time that Ruby arrived in Dallas in 1947, he was friendly with\r\nnumerous underworld figures. One of his earliest Dallas acquaintances\r\nwas Paul Roland Jones, who was convicted of attempting to bribe the\r\nsheriff of Dallas and engaging in the sale of narcotics.[A16-391]\r\nJoe Bonds, one of Ruby’s partners in the Vegas Club, had a criminal\r\nrecord.[A16-392]\r\n\r\nRuby, who enjoyed card playing[A16-393] and horse racing,[A16-394]\r\nwas friendly with several professional gamblers. In 1959, he visited\r\nCuba at the invitation and expense of Lewis McWillie, a professional\r\ngambler.[A16-395] Alice Nichols reported that Ruby’s refusal to give\r\nup gambling was one reason why she never seriously considered marrying\r\nhim.[A16-396] When Sidney Seidband, a Dallas gambler, was arrested\r\nin Oklahoma City, his list of gambling acquaintances included Jack\r\nRuby.[A16-397] And other friends of Ruby have been identified as\r\ngamblers.[A16-398] Finally, two persons of questionable reliability\r\nhave reported that Ruby’s consent was necessary before gambling or\r\nnarcotics operations could be launched in Dallas.[A16-399]\r\n\r\nBased on its evaluation of the record, however, the Commission believes\r\nthat the evidence does not establish a significant link between Ruby\r\nand organized crime. Both State and Federal officials have indicated\r\nthat Ruby was not affiliated with organized criminal activity.[A16-400]\r\nAnd numerous persons have reported that Ruby was not connected with\r\nsuch activity.[A16-401]\r\n\r\n\r\nTravels\r\n\r\nDespite reports that Ruby visited Havana, Las Vegas, New York, Chicago,\r\nHonolulu, and Mexican border towns, most of his time subsequent to 1947\r\nwas spent in Dallas. Some of his travels, including his efforts in\r\nbehalf of “Little Daddy” Nelson and his visit to New Orleans in June\r\n1963 have been discussed.[A16-402] Ruby stated that he went to Chicago\r\nin 1952, in 1958 when his father died, and in August 1963 when he met\r\nmembers of his family at O’Hare International Airport while en route\r\nfrom New York to Dallas.[A16-403] His August trip to New York motivated\r\nby his difficulties with the American Guild of Variety Artists and\r\nhis desire to obtain talent, has been completely established by hotel\r\nrecords.[A16-404] Early in 1963 Ruby also traveled to Wichita, Kans.,\r\nbecause of his interest in stripper Gail Raven,[A16-405] and on May 25,\r\n1963, he apparently registered in an Oklahoma motel.[A16-406]\r\n\r\nAlthough Ruby denies being in Las Vegas after 1937,[A16-407] there are\r\nunsupported rumors that he was in that city in late 1962,[A16-408] and\r\nthe early part of November 1963.[A16-409] Reports that he was in Las\r\nVegas during the weekend prior to the assassination[A16-410] appear\r\nsimilarly unfounded.[A16-411]\r\n\r\nThere is some uncertainty about Ruby’s trip to Havana, Cuba, in\r\n1959. The evidence indicates that he accepted an invitation from\r\ngambler Lewis J. McWillie, who subsequently became a violent\r\nanti-Castroite, to visit Havana at McWillie’s expense.[A16-412] Ruby\r\napparently met McWillie in about 1950, when McWillie operated a Dallas\r\nnightclub.[A16-413] McWillie, whom Ruby said he idolized,[A16-414]\r\nsupervised gambling activities at Havana’s Tropicana Hotel in 1959 and\r\nlater was employed in a managerial capacity in a Las Vegas gambling\r\nestablishment.[A16-415] Ruby testified that he went to Havana for\r\n8 days in August 1959 and left because he was not interested in\r\nits gambling activities.[A16-416] McWillie corroborated this story\r\nexcept that he stated only that Ruby visited Havana “sometime in\r\n1959.”[A16-417] Three Chicagoans reported seeing Ruby in Havana during\r\nthe Labor Day weekend in 1959.[A16-418] Meyer Panitz, an acquaintance\r\nof McWillie, reported that when he met Ruby in Miami during the “summer\r\nof 1959” Ruby stated that he was returning from a pleasure trip to\r\nCuba.[A16-419] The theory that the trip to Havana had conspiratorial\r\nimplications is discussed in chapter VI. There is no reliable evidence\r\nthat Ruby went to Havana subsequent to September 1959.[A16-420]\r\n\r\nAlthough Ruby denied ever being in Hawaii,[A16-421] there is some\r\nevidence that during the summer of 1961 he was in Honolulu seeking\r\ndancing talent.[A16-422] While it is unlikely that Ruby would forget\r\na trip to Honolulu in 1961, there is no other indication that such a\r\ntrip, if it occurred, had any sinister motives.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER AND INTERESTS\r\n\r\nFamily Relationships\r\n\r\nAs mentioned previously,[A16-423] Eva Grant was the only member of the\r\nfamily living in Dallas when Ruby returned to that city in late 1947.\r\nIn 1948, she returned to the west coast, visiting Dallas sporadically\r\nuntil 1959, when she assumed management of the Vegas.[A16-424]\r\nDespite their recurring arguments, during which they sometimes came\r\nto blows,[A16-425] Ruby was closer to Eva than any of his brothers or\r\nsisters. In the summer of 1963, Eva complained bitterly to Ruby because\r\nhe gave a friend about $800 instead of paying Vegas Club bills. Eva,\r\nciting her poor health, stated that she should be hospitalized. Ruby\r\nrejoined that he had provided her money to enter a hospital. He then\r\nshoved her, causing her to fall back about 8 feet and hurt her arm and\r\nshoulder. At this point Ruby insisted he wanted her to leave the Vegas\r\nClub.[A16-426]\r\n\r\nRuby frequently told Eva to submit to an operation and in early\r\nNovember 1963 she consented. She was hospitalized for a week, leaving\r\nabout November 13.[A16-427] While she was in the hospital, Jack called\r\nEarl and Sam, requesting them to convey their concern to Eva.[A16-428]\r\nAccording to Eva, Jack visited her at the hospital two or three times\r\na day. He kept in constant touch with her throughout the weekend of\r\nNovember 22.[A16-429]\r\n\r\nSam Ruby moved to Dallas from Chicago in July 1955, after selling\r\nhis interest in the Earl Products Co.[A16-430] His son’s asthma and\r\nEva’s suggestion that he work as a builder in Dallas prompted the\r\nmove.[A16-431] Apparently as a result of difficulties in collecting the\r\n$5,500 Sam loaned Jack in 1955 to pay Federal excise taxes,[A16-432]\r\nJack and Sam were never particularly close to each other. However, Sam\r\nentered into a partnership in an unsuccessful ice cream business with\r\nJack’s close friend, Ralph Paul.[A16-433] Jack visited Sam and his\r\nfamily occasionally, especially on Jewish holidays, and from time to\r\ntime they spoke to each other by telephone.[A16-434]\r\n\r\nJack had sporadic contacts with his brother Earl, who remained in\r\nChicago until about 1960, when he moved to Detroit.[A16-435] The most\r\nsuccessful of the brothers, Earl often gave Jack business advice and\r\ncapital.[A16-436] He estimated, perhaps conservatively, that, when\r\narrested, Jack owed him $15,000.[A16-437] The evidence also indicates\r\nthat Jack borrowed at least $1,000, and probably more, from his sister\r\nMarion in Chicago.[A16-438]\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial Relationships\r\n\r\nThere have been statements that Ruby was a homosexual. The available\r\nevidence does not support the allegation. There is no evidence of\r\nhomosexuality on his part; Ruby did not frequent known gathering places\r\nfor homosexuals,[A16-439] many of the reports were inherently suspect\r\nor based upon questionable or inaccurate premises,[A16-440] and Ruby\r\nand most of his associates and employees denied the charge.[A16-441]\r\nAll the allegations were based on hearsay or derive from Ruby’s\r\nlisp or a “feeling” that Ruby was a “sissy,” seemed “weird,” acted\r\neffeminately, and sometimes spoke in a high-pitched voice when\r\nangry.[A16-442] Some proceeded upon the erroneous theory that Ruby did\r\nnot date women.[A16-443]\r\n\r\nFor the better part of 11 years, Ruby dated Mrs. Alice Reaves Nichols,\r\na blonde divorcee, 4 years younger than he. Mrs. Nichols, secretary\r\nto a Dallas life insurance company executive,[A16-444] testified that\r\nshe saw Ruby twice a week between 1948 and 1956, and once a week from\r\nthen until about 1959.[A16-445] Ruby discussed marriage with Mrs.\r\nNichols,[A16-446] but Mrs. Nichols stated that while dating Ruby she\r\nwas seeing other men and he was taking out other women.[A16-447]\r\nAlthough there are sharply conflicting reports about whether Ruby dated\r\nwomen who worked for him,[A16-448] the record indicates that Ruby\r\nsought and enjoyed feminine company.[A16-449]\r\n\r\n\r\nAffection for Dogs\r\n\r\nRuby was extremely fond of dogs. Numerous persons stated that he was\r\nconstantly accompanied by several of the dogs he owned.[A16-450]\r\nTestimony at Ruby’s trial in March 1964 indicated that he referred to\r\nhis dogs as his “children.”[A16-451] He also became extremely incensed\r\nwhen he witnessed the maltreatment of any of his dogs.[A16-452]\r\n\r\n\r\nReligious Interests\r\n\r\nReared in the Jewish faith, Jack Ruby was not especially devout. Rabbi\r\nHillel Silverman, whose conservative temple Ruby favored, reported\r\nthat when Ruby’s father died in 1958, Ruby came to services twice\r\ndaily for the prescribed period of 11 months to recite the traditional\r\nmemorial prayer.[A16-453] Ruby normally attended services only on the\r\nJewish high holy days and he was quite unfamiliar with the Hebrew\r\nlanguage.[A16-454]\r\n\r\nRuby was apparently somewhat sensitive to his identity as a Jew.\r\nHe forbade his comedians to tell stories directed at Jews or\r\nJewish practices[A16-455] and, on several occasions after 1947,\r\nhe fought with persons making derogatory remarks about his ethnic\r\norigins.[A16-456] The evidence also indicates that he was deeply upset\r\nthat an advertisement insulting President Kennedy appeared above a\r\nJewish-sounding name.[A16-457]\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Activities and Violence\r\n\r\nWhile in Dallas, Ruby continued attempts to keep in excellent physical\r\ncondition. He frequently exercised at the YMCA, the Carousel, and\r\nhis apartment, where he maintained a set of weights.[A16-458] Ruby\r\nwas extremely concerned about his weight and health, including his\r\nbaldness,[A16-459] and about his appearance in general.[A16-460]\r\n\r\nRuby’s concern for his physical well-being was partially motivated by\r\npractical considerations, for he was his own unofficial club bouncer.\r\nOn about 15 occasions since 1950, he beat with his fists, pistol\r\nwhipped, or blackjacked patrons who became unruly.[A16-461] At other\r\ntimes, he ejected troublesome customers without a beating,[A16-462]\r\nin many instances, justifiably.[A16-463] However, many people stated\r\nthat he employed more force than necessary, particularly because he\r\noften ended a fracas by throwing his victim down the stairs of the\r\nCarousel.[A16-464]\r\n\r\nBesides acting as a bouncer, Ruby on numerous other occasions severely\r\nbeat people who were not club patrons, usually employing only his\r\nfists. Several of these episodes have been discussed in connection with\r\nRuby’s relationship with his employees.[A16-465] In 1951, Ruby attacked\r\na man who had called him a “kike Jew” and knocked out a tooth.[A16-466]\r\nAt about that time Ruby is also reported to have knocked a man down\r\nfrom behind and then to have kicked him in the face.[A16-467] In about\r\n1958, Ruby disarmed a man who had drawn a gun on him at the Vegas,\r\nbeat him almost to death, put the gun back in the man’s pocket, and\r\nthrew him down the stairs.[A16-468] In 1958, Ruby reportedly knocked\r\ndown a man at the Vegas who was 6’3” tall and weighed 230 pounds. Ruby\r\nwas approximately 5’9” tall and weighed about 175 pounds.[A16-469]\r\nRuby then made the man, who had slapped his date, crawl out of the\r\nclub.[A16-470] In a fight at the Vegas, reportedly witnessed by\r\npolicemen, Ruby severely beat a heavyweight boxer who had threatened\r\nhim.[A16-471]\r\n\r\nDuring 1962, several violent episodes occurred. Ruby beat a man\r\nwho refused to pay admission or leave and then shoved him down the\r\nstairs.[A16-472] He “jostled” a woman down the stairs of the Carousel\r\nand struck her escort, who was “much smaller” than he.[A16-473] On\r\none occasion, Ruby picked up a man who was arguing with his date,\r\nknocked him to the floor, cursed him, and then removed him from the\r\nVegas.[A16-474] When a cabdriver entered the Carousel and inquired\r\nabout a patron who had neglected to pay his fare, Ruby struck the\r\ncabdriver.[A16-475]\r\n\r\nIn February 1963, Ruby badly beat Don Tabon, who had made some remarks\r\nabout Ruby’s lady companion, injuring Tabon’s eye.[A16-476] Ruby was\r\nacquitted of a charge of assault and Tabon sought no monetary relief\r\nbecause he believed Ruby financially incapable of satisfying any\r\nresulting judgment. A doctor who went to the Carousel several times\r\nbetween August and November 1963, stated that on each occasion Ruby\r\nejected someone from the club.[A16-477]\r\n\r\nBuddy Turman, a prizefighter and Ruby’s friend, stated that Ruby\r\n“picked his shots.”[A16-478] According to Turman, a bouncer at the\r\nVegas for about a year, Ruby’s victim was frequently drunk, female,\r\nor otherwise incapable of successfully resisting Ruby’s attack. The\r\nevidence indicates that, unlike his youthful escapades, Ruby was often\r\nmalicious. He frequently felt contrite, however, when his anger had\r\npassed or when his victim was an old acquaintance, and he would seek to\r\nmake amends for his violent temper.[A16-479]\r\n\r\nWith two exceptions, there is no evidence that Ruby settled disputes\r\nwith firearms. Shortly before Joe Bonds’ conviction in 1954, Ruby\r\nis reported to have chased Bonds with a pistol.[A16-480] And, Larry\r\nCrafard reported that about a week before the assassination, Ruby told\r\nhim to get Ruby’s gun so that an AGVA official and former employee,\r\nEarl Norman, could be ejected.[A16-481] Although Ruby did not often\r\nuse his gun, it was frequently accessible when he was carrying large\r\namounts of money.[A16-482]\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerosity to Friends and the Need for Recognition\r\n\r\nWhile Ruby often flared up and acted aggressively, he seemed to calm\r\ndown or forget his anger quickly, and there is also a great deal of\r\nevidence that he was extremely generous to his friends. He loaned\r\nmoney to them and apparently cared little whether the loans would\r\nbe repaid.[A16-483] He was quick to offer employment to persons\r\ndesperately in need of a job[A16-484] and he lent considerable aid to\r\npersons seeking work elsewhere.[A16-485] Moreover, when friends or\r\nnew acquaintances had no roof over their heads, Ruby’s apartment was\r\nfrequently theirs to share.[A16-486]\r\n\r\nRuby’s unusual generosity may be explained in part by his extremely\r\nemotional reaction to persons in distress, which may have resulted from\r\nhis firsthand familiarity with poverty, and by his unusual craving to\r\nbe recognized and relied upon.[A16-487] Many of Ruby’s acquaintances\r\ndescribed him as a “publicity hound,” “glad hander,” and “name\r\ndropper,” one always seeking to be the center of attention.[A16-488]\r\nApparently the “egocentrism” of his youth[A16-489] never left Ruby.\r\nYet, frequently he sought reassurance from persons he admired.[A16-490]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XVII\r\n\r\nPolygraph Examination of Jack Ruby\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY ARRANGEMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs early as December of 1963, Jack Ruby expressed his desire to be\r\nexamined with a polygraph, truth serum, or any other scientific device\r\nwhich would test his veracity.[A17-1] The attorneys who defended Ruby\r\nin the State criminal proceedings in Texas agreed that he should take\r\na polygraph examination to test any conspiratorial connection between\r\nRuby and Oswald.[A17-2] To obtain such a test, Ruby’s defense counsel\r\nfiled motions in court and also requested that the FBI administer such\r\nan examination to Ruby.[A17-3] During the course of a psychiatric\r\nexamination on May 11, 1964, Ruby is quoted as saying: “I want to tell\r\nthe truth. I want a polygraph * * *.”[A17-4] In addition, numerous\r\nletters were written to the President’s Commission on behalf of Ruby\r\nrequesting a polygraph examination.[A17-5]\r\n\r\nWhen Ruby testified before the Commission in Dallas County Jail on June\r\n7, 1964, his first words were a request for a lie detector test. The\r\nCommission hearing commenced with the following exchanges:\r\n\r\n    Mr. JACK RUBY. Without a lie detector test on my testimony, my\r\n    verbal statements to you, how do you know if I am telling the\r\n    truth?\r\n\r\n    Mr. TONAHILL [Defense Counsel]. Don’t worry about that, Jack.\r\n\r\n    Mr. RUBY. Just a minute, gentlemen.\r\n\r\n    Chief Justice WARREN. You wanted to ask something, did you, Mr.\r\n    Ruby?\r\n\r\n    Mr. RUBY. I would like to be able to get a lie detector test\r\n    or truth serum of what motivated me to do what I did at\r\n    that particular time, and it seems as you get further into\r\n    something, even though you know what you did, it operates\r\n    against you somehow, brain washes you, that you are weak in\r\n    what you want to tell the truth about and what you want to say\r\n    which is the truth.\r\n\r\n    Now Mr. Warren, I don’t know if you got any confidence in the\r\n    lie detector test and the truth serum, and so on.\r\n\r\n    Chief Justice WARREN. I can’t tell you just how much confidence\r\n    I have in it, because it depends so much on who is taking it,\r\n    and so forth.\r\n\r\n    But I will say this to you, that if you and your counsel want\r\n    any kind of test, I will arrange it for you. I would be glad to\r\n    do that, if you want it. I wouldn’t suggest a lie detector test\r\n    to testify the truth.\r\n\r\n    We will treat you just the same as we do any other witness, but\r\n    if you want such a test, I will arrange for it.\r\n\r\n    Mr. RUBY. I do want it. Will you agree to that, Joe?\r\n\r\n    Mr. TONAHILL. I sure do, Jack.[A17-6]\r\n\r\nThroughout Ruby’s testimony before the Commission, he repeated his\r\nrequest on numerous occasions that he be given an opportunity to take\r\na lie detector test.[A17-7] Ruby’s insistence on taking a polygraph\r\nexamination is reflected right to the end of the proceedings where in\r\nthe very last portion of the transcribed hearings Ruby states:\r\n\r\n    Mr. RUBY. All I want to do is to tell the truth, and the only\r\n    way you can know it is by the polygraph, as that is the only\r\n    way you can know it.\r\n\r\n    Chief Justice WARREN. That we will do for you.[A17-8]\r\n\r\nFollowing Ruby’s insistence on a polygraph test, the Commission\r\ninitiated arrangements to have the FBI conduct such an\r\nexamination.[A17-9] A detailed set of questions was prepared for the\r\npolygraph examination, which was set for July 16, 1964.[A17-10] A\r\nfew days before the scheduled test, the Commission was informed that\r\nRuby’s sister, Eva Grant, and his counsel, Joe H. Tonahill, opposed the\r\npolygraph on the ground that psychiatric examinations showed that his\r\nmental state was such that the test would be meaningless.[A17-11]\r\n\r\nThe Commission was advised that Sol Dann, a Detroit attorney\r\nrepresenting the Ruby family, had informed the Dallas office of the\r\nFBI on July 15, 1964, that a polygraph examination would affect\r\nRuby’s health and would be of questionable value according to Dr.\r\nEmanuel Tanay, a Detroit psychiatrist.[A17-12] On that same date,\r\nAssistant Counsel Arlen Specter discussed by telephone the polygraph\r\nexamination with Defense Counsel Joe H. Tonahill, who expressed his\r\npersonal opinion that a polygraph examination should be administered to\r\nRuby.[A17-13] By letter dated July 15, 1964, Dallas District Attorney\r\nHenry Wade requested that the polygraph examination cover the issue of\r\npremeditation as well as the defensive theories in the case.[A17-14]\r\n\r\nAgainst this background, it was decided that a representative of\r\nthe Commission would travel to Dallas to determine whether Jack\r\nRuby wanted to take the polygraph test. Since Ruby had had frequent\r\nchanges in attorneys and because he was presumed to be sane, the\r\nfinal decision on the examination was his, especially in view of his\r\nprior personal insistence on the test.[A17-15] In the jury conference\r\nroom at the Dallas jail on July 18, Assistant Counsel Arlen Specter,\r\nrepresenting the Commission, informed Chief Defense Counsel Clayton\r\nFowler, co-Counsel Tonahill and Assistant District Attorney William F.\r\nAlexander that the Commission was not insisting on or even requesting\r\nthat the test be taken, but was merely fulfilling its commitment to\r\nmake the examination available.[A17-16] In the event Ruby had changed\r\nhis mind and would so state for the record, that would conclude the\r\nissue as far as the Commission was concerned.[A17-17]\r\n\r\nChief Defense Counsel Fowler had objected to the test. He conferred\r\nwith Jack Ruby in his cell and then returned stating that Ruby insisted\r\non taking the examination.[A17-18] Mr. Fowler requested that (1) Dr.\r\nTanay, the Detroit psychiatrist, be present; (2) the results of the\r\ntest not be disclosed other than to the Commission; (3) the questions\r\nto be asked not be disclosed to the District Attorney’s office; and (4)\r\nthe results of the test be made available to defense counsel.[A17-19]\r\nSheriff William Decker announced his intention to have Allan L. Sweatt,\r\nhis chief criminal deputy who was also a polygraph operator, present\r\nto maintain custody of Jack Ruby while the examination was being\r\nadministered.[A17-20] Assistant District Attorney Alexander requested\r\na list of questions, a copy of the recording made by the polygraph\r\nmachine and a copy of the report interpreting the test.[A17-21] In\r\nresponse to the numerous requests, the procedure was determined\r\nthat the questions to be asked of Ruby would be discussed in a\r\npreliminary session in the presence of defense counsel, the assistant\r\ndistrict attorney and Chief Jailer E. L. Holman, who was to replace\r\nSweatt.[A17-22] The assistant district attorney would not be present\r\nwhen Ruby answered the questions, but Jailer Holman was allowed to\r\nremain to retain custody of Ruby.[A17-23] No commitment was made on\r\nbehalf of the Commission as to what disclosure would be made of the\r\nresults of the examination.[A17-24] Since Dr. Tanay was not in Dallas\r\nand therefore could not be present,[A17-25] arrangements were made\r\nto have in attendance Dr. William R. Beavers, a psychiatrist who had\r\npreviously examined and evaluated Ruby’s mental state.[A17-26]\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the lengthy preliminary proceedings, Ruby\r\nentered the jury conference room at 2:23 p.m. and was informed that\r\nthe Commission was prepared to fulfill its commitment to offer him\r\na polygraph examination, but was not requesting the test.[A17-27]\r\nOn behalf of the Commission, Assistant Counsel Specter warned\r\nRuby that anything he said could be used against him.[A17-28]\r\nChief Defense Counsel Fowler advised Ruby of his objections to the\r\nexamination.[A17-29] Ruby then stated that he wanted the polygraph\r\nexamination conducted and that he wanted the results released to the\r\npublic as promptly as possible.[A17-30] Special Agent Bell P. Herndon,\r\npolygraph operator of the FBI, obtained a written “consent to interview\r\nwith polygraph” signed by Jack Ruby.[A17-31] Herndon then proceeded to\r\nadminister the polygraph examination by breaking the questions up into\r\nseries which were ordinarily nine questions in length and consisted of\r\nrelevant interrogatories and control questions.[A17-32]\r\n\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF THE TEST\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the polygraph examination Jack Ruby answered the\r\nrelevant questions as follows:\r\n\r\n    Q.

Such responses may\r\naccompany and indicate deception.[A17-89] The polygraph instrument\r\nderives its name from the Greek derivative “poly” meaning many and the\r\nword “graph” meaning writings.[A17-90] The polygraph chart writings\r\nconsist of three separate markings placed on a graph reflecting\r\nthree separate physiological reactions.[A17-91] A rubber tube is\r\nplaced around the subject’s chest to record his breathing pattern on\r\na pneumograph.[A17-92] That device records the respiratory ratio of\r\ninhalation and exhalation strokes.[A17-93] The second component is\r\ncalled a galvanic skin response which consists of electrodes placed\r\non the examinee’s fingers, through which a small amount of electrical\r\ncurrent is passed to the skin.[A17-94] The galvanometer records the\r\nminute changes in electrical skin response.[A17-95] The third component\r\nconsists of a cardiograph which is a tracing obtained by attaching\r\na pneumatic cuff around the left arm in a manner very similar to\r\nan apparatus which takes blood pressure.[A17-96] When the cuff is\r\ninflated, that device records relative blood pressures or change in the\r\nheart rate.[A17-97]\r\n\r\nFrom those testing devices, it is possible to measure psychological\r\nor emotional stress.[A17-98] This testing device is the product of\r\nobservation by psychologists and physiologists who noted certain\r\nphysiological responses when people lie.[A17-99] In about 1920\r\nlaw enforcement officials with psychological and physiological\r\ntraining initiated the development of the instrument to serve as an\r\ninvestigative aid.[A17-100]\r\n\r\nThe polygraph may record responses indicative of deception, but it\r\nmust be carefully interpreted.[A17-101] The relevant questions, as to\r\nwhich the interrogator is seeking to determine whether the subject is\r\nfalsifying, are compared with control questions where the examiner\r\nobtains a known indication of deception or some expected emotional\r\nresponse.[A17-102] In evaluating the polygraph, due consideration must\r\nbe given to the fact that a physiological response may be caused by\r\nfactors other than deception, such as fear, anxiety, nervousness,\r\ndislike, and other emotions.[A17-103] There are no valid statistics\r\nas to the reliability of the polygraph.[A17-104] FBI Agent Herndon\r\ntestified that, notwithstanding the absence of percentage indicators of\r\nreliability, an informed judgment may be obtained from a well-qualified\r\nexaminer on the indications of deception in a normal person under\r\nappropriate standards of administration.[A17-105]\r\n\r\nOrdinarily during a polygraph examination only the examiner and\r\nthe examinee are present.[A17-106] It is the practice of the FBI,\r\nhowever, to have a second agent present to take notes.[A17-107] It\r\nis normally undesirable to have other people present during the\r\npolygraph examination because the examinee may react emotionally to\r\nthem.[A17-108] Because of the numerous interested parties involved\r\nin Ruby’s polygraph examination, there were present individuals\r\nrepresenting the Commission and the Dallas district attorney, as\r\nwell as two defense counsel, two FBI agents, the chief jailer, the\r\npsychiatrist, and the court reporter, although the assistant district\r\nattorney and one defense counsel left when Ruby was actually responding\r\nto questions while the instrument was activated.[A17-109] Ruby was\r\nplaced in a position where there was a minimum of distraction for him\r\nduring the test.[A17-110] He faced a wall and could not see anyone\r\nexcept possibly through secondary vision from the side.[A17-111]\r\nAgent Herndon expressed the opinion that Ruby was not affected by the\r\npresence of the people in the room.[A17-112]\r\n\r\nAnswer by Ruby to certain irrelevant control questions suggested an\r\nattempt to deceive on those questions. For example, Ruby answered\r\n“No” to the question “While in the service did you receive any\r\ndisciplinary action?”[A17-113] His reaction suggested deception in his\r\nanswer.[A17-114] Similarly, Ruby’s negative answer to the query “Did\r\nyou ever over-charge a customer?” was suggestive of deception.[A17-115]\r\nRuby further showed an emotional response to other control questions\r\nsuch as “Have you ever been known by another name”[A17-116] “Are you\r\nmarried?”[A17-117] “Have you ever served time in jail?” [A17-118] “Are\r\nyour parents alive?”[A17-119] “Other than what you told me, did you\r\never hit anyone with any kind of a weapon?”[A17-120] Herndon concluded\r\nthat the absence of any physiological response on the relevant\r\nquestions indicated that there was no deception.[A17-121]\r\n\r\nAn accurate evaluation of Ruby’s polygraph examination depends on\r\nwhether he was psychotic. Since a psychotic is divorced from reality,\r\nthe polygraph tracings could not be logically interpreted on such\r\nan individual. A psychotic person might believe a false answer was\r\ntrue so he would not register an emotional response characteristic of\r\ndeception as a normal person would.[A17-122] If a person is so mentally\r\ndisturbed that he does not understand the nature of the questions or\r\nthe substance of his answers, then no validity can be attached to the\r\npolygraph examination.[A17-123] Herndon stated that if a person, on the\r\nother hand, was in touch with reality, then the polygraph examination\r\ncould be interpreted like any other such test.[A17-124]\r\n\r\nBased on his previous contacts with Ruby and from observing him during\r\nthe entire polygraph proceeding, Dr. William R. Beavers testified as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    In the greater proportion of the time that he answered the\r\n    questions, I felt that he was aware of the questions and that\r\n    he understood them, and that he was giving answers based on an\r\n    appreciation of reality.[A17-125]\r\n\r\nDr. Beavers further stated that he had previously diagnosed Ruby as a\r\n“psychotic depressive.” [A17-126]\r\n\r\nBased on the assumption that Ruby was a “psychotic depressive,” Herndon\r\ntestified:\r\n\r\n    There would be no validity to the polygraph examination,\r\n    and no significance should be placed upon the polygraph\r\n    charts.[A17-127]\r\n\r\nConsidering other phases of Dr. Beavers’ testimony, Herndon stated:\r\n\r\n    Well, based on the hypothesis that Ruby was mentally competent\r\n    and sound, the charts could be interpreted, and if those\r\n    conditions are fact, the charts could be interpreted to\r\n    indicate that there was no area of deception present with\r\n    regard to his response to the relevant questions during the\r\n    polygraph examination.[A17-128]\r\n\r\nIn stating his opinion that Ruby was in touch with reality and\r\nunderstood the questions and answers, Dr. Beavers excepted two\r\nquestions where he concluded that Ruby’s underlying delusional state\r\ntook hold.[A17-129] Those questions related to the safety of Ruby’s\r\nfamily and his defense counsel.[A17-130] While in the preliminary\r\nsession Ruby had answered those questions by stating that he felt his\r\nfamily and defense counsel were in danger, he did not answer either\r\nquestion when the polygraph was activated.[A17-131] Dr. Beavers\r\ninterpreted Ruby’s failure to answer as a reflection of “internal\r\nstruggle as to just what was reality.”[A17-132] In addition, Dr.\r\nBeavers testified that the test was not injurious to Ruby’s mental or\r\nphysical condition.[A17-133]\r\n\r\nBecause Ruby not only volunteered but insisted upon taking a polygraph\r\nexamination, the Commission agreed to the examination. FBI Director J.\r\nEdgar Hoover commented on the examination as follows:\r\n\r\n    It should be pointed out that the polygraph, often referred to\r\n    as “lie detector” is not in fact such a device. The instrument\r\n    is designed to record under proper stimuli emotional responses\r\n    in the form of physiological variations which may indicate\r\n    and accompany deception. The FBI feels that the polygraph\r\n    technique is not sufficiently precise to permit absolute\r\n    judgements of deception or truth without qualifications. The\r\n    polygraph technique has a number of limitations, one of which\r\n    relates to the mental fitness and condition of the examinee to\r\n    be tested.\r\n\r\n    During the proceedings at Dallas, Texas, on July 18, 1964, Dr.\r\n    William R. Beavers, a psychiatrist, testified that he would\r\n    generally describe Jack Ruby as a “psychotic depressive.”\r\n    In view of the serious question raised as to Ruby’s mental\r\n    condition, no significance should be placed on the polygraph\r\n    examination and it should be considered nonconclusive as the\r\n    charts cannot be relied upon.[A17-134]\r\n\r\nHaving granted Ruby’s request for the examination, the Commission\r\nis publishing the transcript of the hearing at which the test was\r\nconducted[A17-135] and the transcript of the deposition of the FBI\r\npolygraph operator who administered the test.[A17-136] The Commission\r\ndid not rely on the results of this examination in reaching the\r\nconclusions stated in this report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XVIII\r\n\r\nFootnotes\r\n\r\n\r\nFor references to the testimony of witnesses before the Commission, the\r\nfollowing citation form is used: number of volume, “H” (for “Hearings\r\nbefore the President’s Commission on the Assassination of President\r\nKennedy”), page number, and the name of the witness in parentheses,\r\ne.g., 7 H 441 (O’Donnell).

Some\r\nuncorrected errors are noted below. Unbalanced quotation marks and\r\nparentheses were corrected when the correct positions were apparent.\r\nTwo apparently extraneous, unmatched quotation marks were deleted,\r\nand two unmatched closing parentheses were retained.\r\n\r\nSpelling was not systematically checked.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of\r\ninconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.\r\n\r\nIndex was not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page\r\nreferences.\r\n\r\nThe Exhibit numbers in some illustration captions have been moved to\r\nprecede the descriptions.\r\n\r\nPage 39: Missing footnote anchor 44.\r\n\r\nPage 149: Missing footnote anchor 149.\r\n\r\nPage 238: “lost his job” was misprinted as “lost his his job”;\r\ncorrected here.\r\n\r\nPage 328: “no sources of income Oswald other” was printed that way, as\r\nthough one or more words is missing.\r\n\r\nPage 354: Footnote anchor 1094 was misprinted as 1084; corrected here.\r\n\r\nPage 387: There is no anchor for Footnote 149.\r\n\r\nPage 399: “real”, shown here in italics near the bottom of the page,\r\nalso was underlined.\r\n\r\nAppendices: These documents and reports are Commission Exhibits.\r\nThe typed ones have been transcribed here and also presented as\r\nillustrations at the end of each report; the handwritten ones, and\r\nother handwriting, such as signatures, are presented here only as\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\nPage 494: “Vol XV, p. 744.” was misprinted as “Vol 15”; changed here.\r\n\r\nAppendix VI: Words marked as italics actually were underlined but not\r\nitalicized.\r\n\r\nPage 531: “close the the axilla” was typed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 539: “Connolly” was misspelled that way on this page.\r\n\r\nPage 600: Parts of this page were printed too poorly for reliable\r\ntranscription.\r\n\r\nPage 602: “At 7:10 pm Tippit was arraigned” should be “Oswald”.\r\n\r\nPage 613: The document identification at the bottom of the page\r\noriginally was printed at the bottom of page 612, which was the first\r\npage of this two-page report. Similar identifications shown here at\r\nthe ends of other reports also were moved from the first page of those\r\nreports.\r\n\r\nPage 621: “T. J. TULLY” is unreadable; this transcription is just a\r\nguess.\r\n\r\nPage 756: There is no item number 7.\r\n\r\nPage 788: Missing footnote anchor 158.\r\n\r\nPage 840: “686. CE 139, 3133; 3 H 392-296 (Frazier),” was printed that\r\nway.
