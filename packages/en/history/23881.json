Hardly a man living whom\r\nI suspected of having worked for _Punch_, but I have communicated with\r\nhim; scarce one but has afforded all the information within his\r\nknowledge in response to my application. Editor and members of the\r\n_Punch_ Staff, past and present--\"outsiders,\" equally with those\r\nbelonging to \"the Table\"--the relations and friends of such as are dead,\r\nall have given their help, and have shown an interest in the work which\r\nI hope the result may be thought to justify. All this mass of\r\nmaterial--all the evidence, published and unpublished, that was adduced\r\nin order to establish certain points and refute others--had to be\r\ncarefully sifted and collated, contrary testimony weighed, and the truth\r\ndetermined. Especially was this the case in dealing with the valuable\r\nreminiscences imparted by _Punch's_ earliest collaborators, still or\r\ntill lately living. Of undoubted contributors and their work, it may be\r\nstated, more than two hundred and fifty are here dealt with. A further\r\nnumber cheerfully submitted to cross-examination on one or other of the\r\nmany subjects touched upon; and probably as many more were approached\r\nwith only negative results.\r\n\r\nMy special thanks are due to Mrs. Chaplin, the daughter of the late Mr.\r\nEbenezer Landells, who unreservedly placed in my hands all the _Punch_\r\ndocuments, legal and otherwise, accounts, and letters, concerning the\r\norigin and early editorships of _Punch_, which have been preserved in\r\nthe family; and to Messrs. Bradbury and Agnew, who have supplemented\r\nthese with similar assistance, as well as with books of the Firm\r\nestablishing points of literary interest not hitherto suspected,\r\ntogether with the letters of Thackeray which illustrate his early\r\nconnection with and final secession from the Staff. Apart from their\r\ngeneral interest, these documents, taken together, establish the facts\r\nof such very vexed questions as the origin and the early editorships of\r\n_Punch_. This is the more satisfactory, perhaps, by reason of the\r\nnumerous unfounded claims--or founded chiefly on family tradition or\r\nfilial pride and affection--which are still being made on behalf of\r\nsupposed originators of the Paper. Even these partisan historians, it is\r\nbelieved, will hardly be able to resist the proofs here set forth;\r\nalthough attested fact does not, with them, necessarily carry\r\nconviction. For such services, and for their ready and sympathetic\r\nacquiescence in the requests I have made for permission to quote text or\r\nreproduce engraving, my hearty thanks to Messrs. Bradbury, Agnew and Co.\r\nare due. To them and to all my numerous correspondents I here repeat the\r\nassurance of gratitude for their courtesy which I have privately\r\nexpressed before.\r\n\r\nI have reproduced no more pictures from _Punch_ than were rendered\r\nnecessary by the topics under discussion. I would rather send the\r\nreader, for _Punch's_ pictures, to the ever-fresh pages of _Punch_\r\nitself. Nor, I may add, did I seek information and assistance from its\r\nProprietors until this book was well advanced, preferring to make\r\nindependent research and to test statements on my own account.\r\n\r\nMy primary inducement to the writing of this book has been the interest\r\nsurrounding _Punch_, the study of which has not begotten in me the\r\nhero-worship that can see no fault. How far I have succeeded, it rests\r\nwith the readers of this volume to decide.\r\n\r\n  _September, 1895._\r\n                                                 M. H.

But the men regarding whose lives and stories\r\nyou have curiosity and sympathy appeal to a great number of our other\r\nfaculties, besides our mere sense of ridicule. The humorous writer\r\nprofesses to awaken and direct your love, your pity, your kindness; your\r\nscorn of untruth, pretension, imposture; your tenderness for the weak,\r\nthe poor, the oppressed, the unhappy. To the best of his means and\r\nability he comments on all the ordinary actions and passions of life\r\nalmost.\"\r\n\r\nIt may surely be claimed that these words, consecrated to his mighty\r\npredecessors by the Great Humorist of _Punch_, may be applied without\r\nundue exaggeration to his colleagues on the paper. Though posing at\r\nfirst only as the puppet who waded knee-deep in comic vice, _Punch_ has\r\nworked as a teacher as well as a jester--a leader, and a preacher of\r\nkindness. Nor was it simple humour that was _Punch's_ profession at the\r\nbeginning; he always had a more serious and, so to say, a worthier\r\nobject in view. This may be gathered from the very first article in the\r\nvery first number, the manifesto of the band of men who started it,\r\ncontributed by Mark Lemon, under the title of--\r\n\r\n     \"THE MORAL OF PUNCH.\"\r\n\r\n     \"As we hope, gentle public, to pass many happy hours in your\r\n     society, we think it right that you should know something of our\r\n     character and intentions. Our title, at a first glance, may have\r\n     misled you into a belief that we have no other intention than the\r\n     amusement of a thoughtless crowd, and the collection of pence. We\r\n     have a higher object. Few of the admirers of our prototype, merry\r\n     Master PUNCH, have looked upon his vagaries but as the practical\r\n     outpourings of a rude and boisterous mirth. We have considered him\r\n     as a teacher of no mean pretensions, and have, therefore, adopted\r\n     him as the sponsor for our weekly sheet of pleasant instruction.\r\n     When we have seen him parading in the glories of his motley,\r\n     flourishing his _bâton_ in time with his own unrivalled discord, by\r\n     which he seeks to win the attention and admiration of the crowd,\r\n     what visions of graver puppetry have passed before our eyes!... Our\r\n     ears have rung with the noisy frothiness of those who have bought\r\n     their fellow-men as beasts in the market-place, and found their\r\n     reward in the sycophancy of a degraded constituency, or the\r\n     patronage of a venal ministry--no matter of what creed, for party\r\n     _must_ destroy patriotism....\r\n\r\n     \"There is one portion of PUNCH'S drama we wish was omitted, for it\r\n     always saddens us--we allude to the prison scene. PUNCH, it is\r\n     true, sings in durance, but we hear the ring of the bars mingling\r\n     with the song. We are advocates for the _correction_ of offenders;\r\n     but how many generous and kindly beings are there pining within the\r\n     walls of a prison whose only crimes are poverty and misfortune!...\r\n\r\n     \"We now come to the last great lesson of our motley teacher--the\r\n     gallows; that accursed tree which has its _root_ in injuries. How\r\n     clearly PUNCH exposes the fallacy of that dreadful law which\r\n     authorises the destruction of life! PUNCH sometimes destroys the\r\n     hangman, and why not? Where is the divine injunction against the\r\n     shedder of man's blood to rest? None _can_ answer! To us there is\r\n     but ONE disposer of life. At other times PUNCH hangs the devil:\r\n     this is as it should be. Destroy the principle of evil by\r\n     increasing the means of cultivating the good, and the gallows will\r\n     then become as much a wonder as it is now a jest....\r\n\r\n     \"As on the stage of PUNCH'S theatre many characters appear to fill\r\n     up the interstices of the more important story, so our pages will\r\n     be interspersed with trifles that have no other object than the\r\n     moment's approbation--an end which will never be sought for at the\r\n     expense of others, beyond the evanescent smile of a harmless\r\n     satire.\"\r\n\r\nA portion of this programme was duly eliminated by the abolition of the\r\nFleet and the Marshalsea; and it must be admitted that _Punch_ has long\r\nsince forgotten his declared crusade against capital punishment. But he\r\nhas been otherwise busy. His sympathy for the poor, the starving, the\r\nill-housed, and the oppressed; for the ill-paid curate and the\r\nworse-paid clerk; for the sempstress, the governess, the shop-girl, has\r\nbeen with him not only a religion, but a passion. Professor Ruskin,\r\njudging only by _Punch's_ pictures, and that a little narrowly, has\r\nthought otherwise. _Punch_ \"has never in a single instance,\" says he in\r\nhis \"Art of England,\" \"endeavoured to represent the beauty of the poor.\r\nOn the contrary, his witness to their degradation, as inevitable\r\nconsequences of their London life, is constant and, for the most part,\r\ncontemptuous.\"\r\n\r\nTruth to tell, _Punch_ has been kindly from the first; and a man of\r\nmettle, too. None has been too exalted or too powerful for attack;\r\nwithal, his assaults, in comparison with those of his scurrilous\r\ncontemporaries, have been moderate and gentlemanly in tone. He has\r\nattacked abuses from the highest to the lowest. Sham gentility, vulgar\r\nostentation, crazes and fads, linked æstheticism long drawn out, foolish\r\ncostume, silly affectations of fashion in compliment and language--all\r\nhave been set up as targets for his shafts of ridicule or scorn. He has\r\nbeen a moral reformer and a disinterested critic. A liberal-minded\r\npatriot, he has ever opposed the advocacy of \"Little Peddlington\" in\r\nImperial politics; and municipal maladministration is a perennial\r\nsubject for his denunciations. He has been a kindly cauteriser of social\r\nsores; caustic, but rarely vindictive. Spiritualism, Socialism,\r\nIbsenism, Walt Whitmania--all the movements and sensations of the day,\r\nsocial, political, and artistic, in so far as they are follies--have\r\nbeen shot at as they rose. And having conquered his position, _Punch_\r\nhas known how to retain it. \"The clown,\" says Oliver Wendell Holmes,\r\n\"knows his place to be at the tail of the procession.\" It is to\r\n_Punch's_ honour that with conscious dignity--and, of course, with\r\nconscious impudence--he took _his_ place at its head. And there he has\r\nstayed; and transforming his pages into the Royal Academy of pictorial\r\nsatire, his alone among all the comic papers has forced its way into the\r\nlibrary and taken up its position in the boudoir. His workers are the\r\nbest available in the land; and when in course of time one contributor\r\nfalls away, another is ready to step quickly into his place--_uno avulso\r\nnon deficit alter_.\r\n\r\nSo _Punch_--who for many years past has set up as the incarnation of all\r\nthat is best in wit and virtue--is a scholar and a gentleman. He is,\r\nmoreover, on his own showing, a perfect combination of humour, wisdom,\r\nand honour; and yet, in spite of it all, not a bit of a prig. It is true\r\nthat when he donned the dress-coat, and \"Punch\" and \"Toby\" put on airs\r\nas \"Mr. Punch\" and \"Toby, M.P.,\" he became milder at the expense of some\r\nof his political influence. Yet what he lost in power he gained in\r\nrespectability, as well as in the affection of his countrymen. He\r\nappealed to a higher class, to the greater constituency of the whole\r\nnation; and remembering that a jest's prosperity lies in the ear that\r\nhears it, he transferred some of his allegiance from pit to stalls, and\r\nwas content with the well-bred smile where before he had been eager for\r\nnoisy laughter and loud applause.\r\n\r\nPeople say--among them Mr. du Maurier himself--that there does not seem\r\nquite as much fun and jollity in the world as when John Leech was alive;\r\nbut that surely is only the wail of the middle-aged. Englishmen never\r\nwere uproarious in their mirth, as Froissart once reminded us. But it is\r\ntrue that _Punch_ does not indulge so much as once he did in\r\ncaricature--which after all, as Carlyle has pointed out, is not Humour\r\nat all, but Drollery. Caricature, one must remember, has two mortal\r\nenemies--a small and a great: artistic excellence of draughtsmanship,\r\nand national prosperity with its consequent contentment. Good harvests\r\nbeget good-humour. They stifle all motive for genuine caricature, for\r\n\"satire thrives only on the wrath of the multitude.\" A joke may be only\r\na joke--or a comedy, or a tragedy; but the greatest caricature (which\r\nneed by no means display the greatest art) is necessarily that which\r\ngoes straightest to the heart and mind. No drawing is true caricature\r\nwhich does not make the beholder _think_, whether it springs simply from\r\ngood-humour or has its source in the passion of contempt, hatred, or\r\nrevenge, of hope or despair. Mere amusement, said Swift, \"is the\r\nhappiness of those who cannot think,\" while Humour, to quote Carlyle\r\nagain, \"is properly the exponent of low things; that which first renders\r\nthem poetical to the mind.\" Through this truth we may see how _Punch_\r\nhas so continually dealt with vulgarity without being vulgar; while many\r\nof his so-called rivals, touching the self-same subjects, have so\r\ntainted themselves as to render them fitter for the kitchen than the\r\ndrawing-room, through lack of this saving grace. Fun may have been in\r\ntheir jokes, but not true humour. _Punch_ thus became to London much\r\nwhat the Old Comedy was to Athens; and, whatever individual critics may\r\nsay, he is recognised as the Nation's Jester, though he has always\r\nsought to do what Swift declared was futile--to work upon the feelings\r\nof the vulgar with fine sense, which \"is like endeavouring to hew blocks\r\nwith a razor.\"\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing more than another on which _Punch_ prides\r\nhimself--on which, nevertheless, he is constantly reproached by those\r\nwho would see his pages a remorseless mirror of human weakness and\r\nvice--it is his purity and cleanness; his abstention from the unsavoury\r\nsubjects which form the principal stock-in-trade of the French humorist.\r\nThis trait was Thackeray's delight. \"As for your morality, sir,\" he\r\nwrote to Mr. Punch, \"it does not become me to compliment you on it\r\nbefore your venerable face; but permit me to say that there never was\r\nbefore published in this world so many volumes that contained so much\r\ncause for laughing, and so little for blushing; so many jokes, and so\r\nlittle harm. Why, sir, say even that your modesty, which astonishes me\r\nmore and more every time I regard you, is calculated, and not a virtue\r\nnaturally inherent in you, that very fact would argue for the high sense\r\nof the public morality among us. We will laugh in the company of our\r\nwives and children; we will tolerate no indecorum; we like that our\r\nmatrons and girls should be pure.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not till the great occasion of his Jubilee that the Merry Old\r\nGentleman of Fleet Street, who \"hath no Party save Mankind; no\r\nLeader--but Himself,\" discovered the full measure of his popularity. The\r\nday broke for him amid a chorus of greeting--a perfect pæan of triumph,\r\nin which his own trumpet was not the softest blown. It is not an\r\nexaggeration to say that the Press of the world welcomed the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of his birth, and that with a cordiality and unanimity never\r\nbefore accorded to any paper. Hardly a journal in the English-speaking\r\nworld but commented on the event with kindly sympathy; hardly one that\r\nmarred the celebration with an ill-humoured reflection. Pencil as well\r\nas pen was put to it to do honour to the greatest comic paper in the\r\nworld, and demonstrate in touching friendliness the confraternity of the\r\nPress.\r\n\r\nFor the public, _Punch_ issued his \"Jubilee number\" and, in accordance\r\nwith the promise given in the first volume fifty years before, he\r\nproduced in his hundredth a brief history of his career and the names of\r\nthe men who made it, modestly advising his readers to secure a set of\r\nhis back volumes as the real \"Hundred Best Books.\" For himself, he dined\r\nwith the Staff at the \"Ship Hotel\" at Greenwich, when the Editor, who\r\noccupied the chair, was fêted by the proprietors of the paper and\r\nreceived a suitable memento of the glorious event.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. PUNCH PORTRAYED BY DIFFERENT HANDS.\r\n\r\n_See p. 9._]\r\n\r\nAnd what may appear to some as the most curious celebration of all was a\r\nsolemn religious celebration--nothing less than a _Te Deum_--in honour\r\nof the occasion. It sounds at first, perhaps, a little like a\r\njoke--though not in good enough taste to be one of Mr. Punch's own; but\r\nthe service was held; and when regarded in the light shed upon it by the\r\nRev. J. de Kewer Williams, the incongruity of it almost disappears. \"I\r\nled my people yesterday,\" he wrote, \"in giving thanks on the occasion\r\nof your Jubilee, praying that you might ever be as discreet and as\r\nkindly as you have always been.\" The prayer spoken in the pulpit\r\nappropriately ended as follows: \"For it is so easy to be witty and\r\nwicked, and so hard to be witty and wise. May its satire ever be as good\r\nand genial, and the other papers follow its excellent example!\"\r\n\r\nThe public tribute was not less cordial and sincere, and poetic\r\neffusions flowed in a gushing stream. But none of these verses, doggerel\r\nand otherwise, expressed more felicitously the general feeling than\r\nthose which had been written some years before by Henry J. Byron--(who\r\nhad himself attempted to establish a rival to _Punch_, but had been\r\ncrushed by the greater weight)--one of his verses running:--\r\n\r\n  \"From 'Forty-one to present times\r\n    How much these pages speak,\r\n  And _Punch_ still bids us look into\r\n    The middle of next week;\r\n  And that's a Wednesday, as we know,\r\n    When still our friend appears,\r\n  As honest, fearless, bright, and pure\r\n    As in the bygone years.\"\r\n\r\nBut greater far than the public esteem is the affection of the Staff,\r\nwho naturally enough regard the personality of _Punch_ with a good deal\r\nmore than ordinary loyal sentiment and _esprit de corps_. It is\r\ninteresting to observe the different views the artists have severally\r\ntaken of it, for most of them in turn have attempted his portrayal.\r\nBrine regarded him as a mere buffoon, devoid of either dignity or\r\nbreeding; Crowquill, as a grinning, drum-beating Showman; Doyle,\r\nThackeray, and others adhered to the idea of the Merry, but certainly\r\nnot uproarious, Hunchback; Sir John Tenniel showed him as a vivified\r\npuppet, all that was earnest, responsible, and wise, laughing and\r\nhigh-minded; Keene looked on him generally as a youngish, bright-eyed,\r\nbut apparently brainless gentleman, afflicted with a pitiable deformity\r\nof chin, and sometimes of spine; Sir John Gilbert as a rollicking\r\nPolichinelle, and Kenny Meadows as Punchinello; John Leech's\r\nconception, originally inspired, no doubt, by George Cruikshank's\r\ncelebrated etchings, was the embodiment of everything that was jolly and\r\nall that was just, on occasion terribly severe, half flesh, half\r\nwood--the father, manifestly, of Sir John Tenniel's improved figure of\r\nmore recent times. Every artist--Mr. du Maurier, Mr. Sambourne, Mr.\r\nFurniss, and the rest--has had his own ideal; and it is curious to\r\nobserve that in his realisation of it, each has illustrated or betrayed\r\nin just measure the strength or weakness of his own imagination.\r\n\r\nSome of these portraits, characteristic examples of _Punch's_ leading\r\nartists, are reproduced on page 7, arranged according to authorship,\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n  W.

It is not that his parentage has been lost to\r\nhistory in a discreet and charitable silence; on the contrary, it is\r\nrather that that honour has been claimed by over-many, covetous of the\r\ndistinction. He seems to come within the category of Defoe's true-born\r\nEnglishman, \"whose parents were the Lord knows who,\" not because there\r\nshould be any doubt upon the subject, but because none suspected at the\r\ntime the latent importance of the bantling and the circumstances of his\r\nbirth until it seemed too late to decide by demonstration or simple\r\naffirmation who was father and who the sponsors. Had it then been known\r\nthat _Punch_ was born for immortality, I should not now be at the pains\r\nof setting forth, at greater length than would otherwise be necessary or\r\njustifiable, the proofs of his parentage and of his natal place.\r\n\r\n  \"Great Homer's birth seven rival cities claim,\r\n  Too mighty such monopoly of Fame.\"\r\n\r\nRubens was born both at Antwerp and Cologne. One knows it to be so, when\r\none has visited both houses. Hans Memling, again, was native of Bruges\r\nand Mömelingen too. It is hardly surprising, then, that several\r\nroof-trees claim the honour of having sheltered the new-born _Punch_,\r\nand that many men have contended for his paternity.\r\n\r\nI say \"his\" paternity; for the absolute personality of _Punch_ has\r\nlong been recognised. It has been the usual custom of comic papers\r\nto indulge in a similar fiction, mildly humorous and conveniently\r\nanonymous--\"Figaro in London,\" \"Pasquin,\" \"The Puppet Show\"-man, \"The\r\nMan in the Moon,\" and the rest. But _Punch_ was not only a personality\r\nhimself, but at the outset began by introducing the rest of his family\r\nto the public. Nowadays he ignores his wife, especially since a\r\ncontemporary has appropriated her name. But this was not always so. In\r\nhis prospectus he announces that his department of \"Fashion\" will be\r\nconducted by Mrs. J. Punch, whose portrait, drawn by Leech's pencil,\r\nappeared in 1844 (p. 19, Vol. VI.), and who was seen again, under the\r\nname of Judina, in honourable companionship with her husband, in the\r\npreface to Vol. XLVII., for 1864, and once more in \"Mrs. Punch's Letters\r\nto Her Daughter.\" His daughter Julia, too, being then, in 1841, \"in\r\nservice,\" wrote a letter to the journal in that style of damaged\r\northography afterwards adopted by the immortal Jeames and his American\r\ncousin, Artemus Ward. But it was not long before _Punch_ took a rise in\r\nthe social scale, and many men of distinction in literature have claimed\r\nhim for their child with all the emphasis of groundless assertion.\r\n\r\nAccording to the \"City Press\" (June 27th, 1892), Mr. C. Mitchell\r\nfrequently declared that _Punch_ originated with him, Shirley Brooks,\r\nHenry Mayhew, and Ebenezer Landells, in his office in Red Lion Court,\r\nthe latter drawing the original sketch of the pink monthly cover of\r\n_Punch_. But as Shirley Brooks did not come on the scene till thirteen\r\nyears later, and as the cover in question is the one designed, and\r\nsigned, by Sir John Gilbert in 1842, the claim may be dismissed, except\r\nin so far as it may support Landells' statement that he prepared the\r\nscheme of such a paper and submitted it to several publishers before he\r\nand his associates determined upon carrying it themselves into\r\nexecution. And soon after it was started, as will be seen, the services\r\nof a speculative printer were anxiously sought.\r\n\r\nMr. Hatton declares that Mark Lemon \"always spoke of it to me as a\r\nproject of himself and Henry Mayhew,\" wherein he is followed by the\r\n\"Dictionary of National Biography;\" and the Hon. T. T. à Beckett gives\r\nthe exclusive honour to Henry Mayhew (wherein he is followed by the same\r\nauthority in the notice of the latter writer), but admits the further\r\nfounder's claim of Stirling Coyne.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the well-known, but sadly inaccurate, pamphlet entitled\r\n\"Mr. Punch, His Origin and Career,\" which was published in 1882 as a\r\nmemorial of Mark Lemon, explains circumstantially that it was Mr. Last,\r\nthe printer, who proposed the idea to Henry Mayhew, who \"readily\r\naccepted it.\" The book is generally accredited to Sidney Blanchard; but\r\nwhen I explain that the printer of it, now deceased, informed me that it\r\nwas written and brought to him by Last's son, the transfer of the\r\ncentral interest from Landells and Henry Mayhew becomes intelligible.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. R. B. Postans, the house-chum of Henry Mayhew, \"his\r\ncompanion from morning to night,\" and George Hodder, in his oft-quoted\r\n\"Memories of My Time,\" agree in according undivided credit to Henry\r\nMayhew; but they unfortunately disagree in essentials, and contradict\r\neach other, and indirectly confirm my own conclusions. Hodder further\r\ndeclares that Mayhew invented the paper and its name simultaneously,\r\nwhich sprang Minerva-like, full-titled, from his brain--which we know to\r\nbe untrue, as the name was not decided upon until a subsequent meeting.\r\nIndeed, on the final prospectus, written with Mark Lemon's hand, as may\r\nbe seen on p. 20, the present title was only inserted as an\r\nafter-thought.\r\n\r\nThen comes the version of Henry Mayhew's son, Mr. Athol Mayhew, who\r\nclaims everything for his father in a statement of some length, in some\r\nrespects authentic, but in many details entirely erroneous. He carries\r\nback Mayhew's idea of a \"London Charivari\" to the year 1835; but, as\r\nwill be seen a little further on, Orrin Smith, Jerrold, Thackeray, and\r\nseveral more of the wags of the day afterwards combined in a stillborn\r\neffort to start a similar paper based on the same model. The writer\r\nbases his case far too much on Hodder's \"Memories,\" which, entertaining\r\nthough they are, do not universally command the trust and respect with\r\nwhich Mr. Athol Mayhew regards them. \"A more sanguine man than my\r\nfather,\" he says, \"never breathed, and in his arrangement with Hodder\r\nappears to have taken everything for granted, although the scheme had\r\nnot as yet been even breathed to Messrs. Landells and Last [the engraver\r\nand printer]; for when the latter gentleman agreed to enter into the\r\nspeculation, Mayhew had removed to Clement's Inn.\" But the writer, who\r\nwould appear to have inherited the paternal characteristic of \"taking\r\neverything for granted,\" has not considered that Hodder declared that\r\nhis visit to Hemming's Row, by which occasion it is alleged that the new\r\n_Punch_ had sprung to Mayhew's brain, was \"_in the summer_.\" As _Punch_\r\nappeared in the middle of July, and, according to the draft prospectus,\r\nwas first arranged to appear on June 10th (though this may possibly have\r\nbeen a _lapsus calami_), it requires more than ordinary sanguineness to\r\naccept the statement that not a word had been breathed to persons so\r\nparamount in such a newspaper enterprise as the printer and\r\nengraver--especially when the paper was to make its appearance in a few\r\ndays' time. And yet Mr. Mayhew adds that matters did not progress even\r\nso rapidly as his authority, George Hodder, narrates.\r\n\r\nYet although it was not, as will appear, Henry Mayhew who was the actual\r\ninitiator of _Punch_, it was unquestionably he to whom the whole credit\r\nbelongs of having developed Landells' specific idea of a \"Charivari,\"\r\nand of its conception in the form it took. Though not the absolute\r\nauthor of its existence, he was certainly the author of its literary and\r\nartistic being, and to that degree, as he was wont to claim, he was its\r\n_founder_.\r\n\r\nFrom all these versions (which, after all, vary hardly more than the\r\naccounts of other incidents of _Punch_ life[1]) it is not very easy at\r\nfirst sight to sift the truth. There is a story of the tutor of an\r\nHeir-Apparent who asked his pupil, by way of examination, what was the\r\ndate of the battle of Agincourt. \"1560,\" promptly replied the Prince.\r\n\"The date which your Royal Highness has mentioned,\" said the tutor, \"is\r\nperfectly correct, but I would venture to point out that it has no\r\napplication to the subject under discussion.\" A like criticism might\r\nfairly be passed on each existing reading of the genesis of _Punch_. It\r\nhas been worth while, for the first time, and it is to be hoped the\r\nlast, to collate and compare these statements, and ascertain the facts\r\nas far as possible. Claims have been set up, variously and severally,\r\nfor Henry Mayhew, Mark Lemon, Joseph Last, Ebenezer Landells, and\r\nStirling Coyne; even Douglas Jerrold and Gilbert à Beckett have been\r\ndeclared originators, though no such pretentions came directly from\r\nthem. Otherwise than in the spirit of the Scottish minister who\r\nexclaimed, \"Brethren, let us look our difficulties boldly and fairly in\r\nthe face--and pass on,\" I propose to take those portions of the stories\r\nwhich tally with the facts I have ascertained and verified beyond all\r\ndoubt, and, disentangling the general confusion as briefly as may be, to\r\npresent one consistent version, which must stand untainted by claims of\r\nfriendship, by pride of kinship, or filial respect.\r\n\r\nIt had occurred to many of the wits, literary and artistic, who well\r\nunderstood the cause of mortality in the so-called comic press that had\r\ngone before, that a paper might succeed which was decently and cleanly\r\nconducted. It might be as slashing in its wit and as fearless in its\r\nopinions as it pleased, so long as those opinions were honest and their\r\nexpression restrained. Their idea was founded rather on Philipon's Paris\r\n\"Charivari\" than on anything that had appeared in England; but they\r\nplainly saw that to attract and hold the public the paper which they\r\nimagined must be a weekly and not a daily one. The Staff which was\r\nbrought together consisted of Douglas Jerrold, Thackeray, Laman\r\nBlanchard, Percival Leigh, and Poole, author of \"Paul Pry\"--authors; and\r\nKenny Meadows, Leech, and perhaps Crowquill--artists; with Orrin Smith\r\nas engraver. The whole scheme of this new \"London Charivari\" was in a\r\nforward state of preparation, even to pages of text being set up, when\r\nit suddenly collapsed through a mistaken notion of Thackeray's that each\r\nco-partner--there being no \"capitalist\" thought of--would be liable for\r\nthe private debts of his colleagues. The suggestion was too much for the\r\nfaith of the schemers in one another's discretion, and \"The London\r\nCharivari\" was incontinently dropped; yet unquestionably it had some\r\nindirect influence on the subsequent constitution and career of Mr.\r\nPunch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EBENEZER LANDELLS.]\r\n\r\nFor some years the success of the Paris \"Charivari\" had attracted the\r\nattention of Mr. Ebenezer Landells, wood-engraver, draughtsman, and\r\nnewspaper projector. He had been a favourite pupil of the great Bewick\r\nhimself, and had come up to London, where he soon made his mark as John\r\nJackson's and Harvey's chief lieutenant and obtained an entrance into\r\nliterary and artistic circles. A man of great originality and initiative\r\nability, of unflagging energy and industry, of considerable artistic\r\ntaste, and of great amiability, he also had the defect of the creative\r\nquality of his mind, so that, owing to that lack of business talent\r\nwhich the public generally associates with the artistic temperament, he\r\ndid not ultimately prove himself more than a moderate financial success.\r\nAs Jerrold, Thackeray, and the rest had done before him, he believed in\r\na \"Charivari\" for England, and pondered how the Parisian success might\r\nbe emulated and achieved. In his house at 22, Bidborough Street, St.\r\nPancras (where most of the early _Punch_ blocks were cut), he had a\r\nready-made staff of engravers that included some names destined to\r\nbecome better known--Mr. Birket Foster; Mr. Edmund Evans, best known\r\nnowadays in connection with Miss Kate Greenaway's delightful children's\r\nbooks; J. Greenaway, her father, who became a master engraver himself;\r\nand William Gaiter, who afterwards took Orders; while \"outside\" were\r\nEdward and George Dalziel, T. Armstrong, and Charles Gorway. With these\r\nyoung men the handsome, tall engraver was extremely popular; they called\r\nhim \"the Skipper,\" or \"Old Tooch-it-oop\" behind his back, in token of\r\nhis Northumbrian accent, but to his friends he was generally known as\r\n\"Daddy Longlegs,\" or \"Daddy Landells.\"\r\n\r\nSo Landells took the idea, which he determined upon carrying out, to one\r\nor two well-established publishers, Wright of Fleet Street amongst them,\r\nbut none could see the germ of a first-rate property in it. It was\r\nobjected that the temperament of the English people so differed from\r\nthat of the French that they certainly would neither appreciate nor\r\nencourage the requisite style of writing, even supposing--which they did\r\nnot believe--that the necessary talent were forthcoming. Moreover, they\r\nwould not credit that a comic paper could succeed without the\r\nscurrility, and often enough the indecencies, that had distinguished\r\nearlier satirical prints; and although the popularity of Hood's \"Comic\r\nAnnual\" and Cruikshank's \"Comic Almanac\" was pointed to, they would have\r\nnothing to do with a weekly, however much it professed to supersede\r\nprevious ribaldry with clean wit and healthy humour.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, early in 1841 Landells was concerned, with his friend\r\nJoseph Last, printer, of 3, Crane Court, Fleet Street, in projecting a\r\nperiodical known as \"The Cosmorama,\" an illustrated journal of life and\r\nmanners of the day, and to him Landells imparted his conviction that\r\nsuch a journal as he imagined would certainly succeed. The enterprising\r\nprinter lent a readier ear than others had done (perhaps, in view of his\r\nlimited capital and still more limited ideas of speculation, altogether\r\ntoo ready an ear), and agreed with Landells to take up so excellent a\r\nnotion. Now, in the little world of comic writing a brilliant humorist\r\nwas at work--Henry Mayhew, one of several brothers of ability, a man\r\nwhose resource was equal to his wit. He was already known to Last as the\r\nson of the leading member of the firm of Mayhew, Johnston, and Mayhew,\r\nof Carey Street, his legal advisers. He was residing at the time at\r\nHemming's Row, over a haberdasher's shop, and, with F. W. N. Bayley and\r\nothers, he had been secured as writer on \"The Cosmorama.\" Landells,\r\nintroduced to him by Last, approached him on the subject of the\r\n\"Charivari.\" Mayhew grasped the conception at once, and, as the sequel\r\nproved, saw it more completely, and perhaps appreciated its literary and\r\nartistic possibilities more clearly, than either its material originator\r\nor his ambassador had done. He immediately advised dropping \"The\r\nCosmorama,\" and directing on to the new comic all the energy and\r\nresources that were to have been put into the more commonplace\r\npublication. In due course he imparted the new idea to his friend\r\nPostans, who shared his room, and to other visitors; but he forgot to\r\nmention how the idea had been brought to him, so that his friends not\r\nunnaturally counted it as another of Harry's many happy, but usually\r\nimpracticable, thoughts. But in this instance Mayhew made his\r\npersonality felt, for the character of the paper, instead of partaking\r\nof that acidulated, sardonic satire which was distinctive of Philipon's\r\njournal, on which it was to have been modelled, took its tone from\r\nMayhew's genial temperament, and from the first became, or aimed at\r\nbecoming, a budget of wit, fun, and kindly humour, and of honest\r\nopposition based upon fairness and justice.\r\n\r\nAs for the Staff of such a paper as he imagined, Mayhew urged that he\r\ncould secure the services of Douglas Jerrold, Gilbert à Beckett, Mark\r\nLemon, Stirling Coyne, and others, in addition to those already engaged;\r\nand then adjournment was proposed to Mark Lemon's rooms in Newcastle\r\nStreet, Strand. \"The Shakespeare's Head,\" in Wych Street, had\r\npreviously been Lemon's place of business. It was the meeting-place of\r\nthe little \"quoting, quipping, quaffing\" club of fellow-workers in\r\nBohemia; and Lemon, it was explained, had dabbled both in verse and the\r\nlighter drama, efforts which were \"not half bad.\" Little did the writer\r\ndream that his modest Muse had marked him out for the editorship of the\r\ngreatest comic journal the world has seen! To the duties of\r\ntavern-keeper Lemon, who was enamoured of literature and the drama, had\r\nbeen condemned by a fate more than usually unkind. He had found himself\r\nnearly penniless when Mr. Very, his stepfather, offered him a clerical\r\nposition in his brewery in Kentish Town. But the brewery failed, and\r\nwith it Lemon's livelihood, and he was only rescued by a jovial\r\ntavern-keeper named Roper, one of his stepfather's customers, and by him\r\nput into charge--disastrously for both--of the Wych Street public-house.\r\nThen he married, having borrowed five pounds to do it with, and by his\r\nwife's advice kept in touch with his literary acquaintance; and by the\r\nacceptance of a five-act comedy by Charles Mathews at Covent\r\nGarden--which was to be played by a cast including the great comedian's\r\nself, Mme. Vestris, and \"Old\" Farren--he received a hundred pounds down,\r\nand was tided over his difficulties until the starting of _Punch_ gave\r\nhim permanent employment.\r\n\r\nSo to Mark Lemon they went, and a full list was quickly drawn up. Mayhew\r\nundertook to communicate with Douglas Jerrold, who, then better known to\r\nthe public as the successful dramatist than as the great satirist, was\r\nstaying at Boulogne for the sake of his young family's education; and a\r\ncharming picture has been drawn by his son of how, on the visit of à\r\nBeckett, Charles Dickens, and the rest, he would throw off his clothes\r\nand swim with them in the sea, or challenge them to a game of leap-frog\r\non the sands--a curious contrast to his own declaration that the only\r\nexercise he cared for was cribbage.[2]\r\n\r\nStirling Coyne, Daily, W. H. Wills, H. P. Grattan (H. Plunkett, otherwise\r\n\"Fusbos\"), Henning, Henry Baylis, and \"Paul Prendergast\"--whose \"Comic\r\nLatin Grammar\" had been attracting much attention--were proposed, and\r\nHodder was told off to wait upon the latter. At the adjourned meeting at\r\nthe \"Edinburgh Castle\" tavern in the Strand, Somerset House, Postans,\r\nWilliam Newman, Baylis (afterwards president of the \"_Punch_ Club\"),\r\nStirling Coyne, Henning, Mayhew, Landells, and Hodder were present.\r\nThe latter then explained that \"Prendergast\" was a young medical man,\r\nPercival Leigh by name, who preferred to wait before giving his adhesion\r\nuntil he was satisfied as to the character of the publication; and \"Phiz\"\r\nhad returned a similar reply to Mark Lemon--though later on he was\r\nglad enough to accept little commissions in the way of drawing initial\r\nletters for the paper.\r\n\r\nHenning was then nominated cartoonist; Brine, Phillips, and Newman,\r\nartists-in-ordinary; and Lemon, Coyne, Mayhew, à Beckett, and Wills, the\r\nliterary Staff, until the advent of the others, whose adhesion was\r\nanxiously awaited. Henry Mayhew, Mark Lemon, and Stirling Coyne were to\r\nbe joint editors; Last, of course, was to be printer, and Landells\r\nengraver; and W. Bryant publisher. Several more meetings were held--at\r\nthe \"Crown\" in Vinegar Yard, at Landells' house, and elsewhere--and in\r\ndue course Mark Lemon produced the draft prospectus, consisting of three\r\nfolios of blue paper, which probably contains a good deal more of Mayhew\r\nand Coyne than of Mark Lemon. Edmund Yates estimated its chemical\r\ncomposition thus:--\r\n\r\n  Henry Mayhew      95\r\n  Stirling Coyne     3\r\n  W. H. Wills        1.5\r\n  Mark Lemon          .5\r\n                  ------\r\n                   100\r\n\r\nAnd his estimate was probably correct. This interesting document is here\r\nshown in reduced facsimile:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _THE HISTORY OF \"PUNCH.\"_\r\n\r\nDRAFT OF THE _PUNCH_ PROSPECTUS, IN MARK LEMON'S HANDWRITING (REDUCED).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _THE DRAFT PROSPECTUS._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE _PUNCH_ PROSPECTUS.\r\n\r\n(_Original size of page 5-1/4 x 3-3/4 inches._)]\r\n\r\nAt the head of this announcement there was a woodcut of Lord Morpeth,\r\nLord Melbourne (Prime Minister), and Lord John Russell, who were then in\r\noffice, but were popularly, and correctly, supposed to be in imminent\r\ndanger of defeat. The price originally proposed was twopence--the usual\r\nprice of similar papers of the day--but it was altered to \"the\r\nirresistibly comic charge of threepence!!\" and the title was being\r\ngiven as \"The Fun----,\" when the writer stopped short and erased it. It\r\nis generally believed that the intention was to call the paper \"The\r\nFunny Dog--with Comic Tales,\" as appears in the final line of the\r\nprospectus; a title, moreover, that was employed in 1857 for a book in\r\nwhich more than one _Punch_ man co-operated. A reduced copy of the now\r\nrare leaflet as it was printed and circulated by tens of thousands is\r\ngiven on the previous page. \"Vates,\" it should be explained, was the\r\n_nom de plume_ of the notorious sporting tipster then attached to\r\n\"Bell's Life in London.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of _Punch's_ name, there are as many versions as of the\r\norigin of _Punch_ itself. Hodder declares that it was Mayhew's sudden\r\ninspiration. Last asserted that when \"somebody\" at the \"Edinburgh\r\nCastle\" meeting spoke of the paper, like a good mixture of punch, being\r\nnothing without Lemon, Mayhew caught at the idea and cried, \"A capital\r\nidea! We'll call it _Punch_!\" Jovial Hal Baylis it was, says another,\r\nwho, when refreshment time came round (it was always coming round with\r\nhim), gave the hint so readily taken. Mrs. Brezzi, wife of the sculptor,\r\nlays the scene of the first meeting in the \"Wrekin Tavern,\" Broad\r\nStreet, Longacre, and writes that the founders were only prevented from\r\ncalling the paper \"Cupid,\" with Lord Brougham in that character on the\r\ntitle-page [presumably a mistake for Lord Palmerston, who subsequently\r\nwas so shown in _Punch_ by Brine, picking his teeth with his arrow] by\r\nthe sight from Joseph Allen's window of a Punch and Judy show in the\r\nnorth-eastern corner of Trafalgar Square. Mrs. Bacon, Mark Lemon's\r\nniece, informs me that she distinctly remembers being seated among the\r\ngentlemen who met at his rooms in Newcastle Street, and hearing Henry\r\nMayhew suddenly exclaim, \"Let the name be 'Punch'!\"--a fact engraven on\r\nher memory through her childish passion for the reprobate old puppet.\r\nMr. E. Stirling Coyne claims that it was his father who suggested the\r\ntitle at the memorable meeting at Allen's. This, at least, in Lemon's\r\nwords, is certain: \"It was called _Punch_ because it was short and\r\nsweet. And Punch is an English institution. Everyone loves Punch, and\r\nwill be drawn aside to listen to it. All our ideas connected with Punch\r\nare happy ones.\" The decision was not set aside when it was found that\r\nJerrold had edited a \"Punch in London\" years before, proposed to him a\r\nfew months earlier by Mr. Mills (of Mills, Jowett, and Mills). But the\r\nfavour with which the title was received was not universal. \"I\r\nremember,\" Mr. Birket Foster tells me, \"Landells coming into the\r\nworkshop and saying, 'Well, boys, the title for the new work is to be\r\n_Punch_.' When he was gone, we said it was a very stupid one, little\r\nthinking what a great thing it was to become.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIGNATURES ON DOCUMENT BY WHICH _PUNCH_ WAS FOUNDED.\r\n\r\n(_See Appendix I._)]\r\n\r\nThe business plan was to be a co-operative one. Mayhew, Lemon, and\r\nCoyne, it was finally agreed, were to be co-editors and own one-third\r\nshare as payment.[3] Last was to find the printing and own one share,\r\nand Landells was to find drawings and engraving, and own one share. The\r\nclaims of outside contributors (among whom were Jerrold and à Beckett)\r\nand the paper-maker's bill were to be the first charge on the proceeds;\r\nand if these were not enough, Landells and Last were to make up the\r\ndeficiency. So, on the same plan as the first abortive attempt of a\r\n\"London Charivari,\" the new paper was embarked on, by men who with but\r\nlittle capital (\"it was started with £25--which I found!\" says Landells)\r\nyet threw themselves into it, and became their own publishers.\r\nAdvertising to the extent of £111 12s. was ventured on, including\r\n\"billing in 6 Mags.,\" \"page in 'Master Humphrey's Clock' twice,\" 100,000\r\nof the prospectuses reproduced on p. 23,[4] and 2,000 window-bills that\r\nbore the design which Henning drew for _Punch's_ cover, after a rough\r\nsketch by Landells.\r\n\r\nIt was a busy fortnight; and it may well be doubted if any other journal\r\nof such great eventual popularity has ever been launched with so little\r\npreparation. Every technical detail identical with what was employed up\r\nto recent years was settled; Henning drew his ill-composed cartoon of\r\n\"Parliamentary Candidates under Different Heads,\" roughly done, but not\r\nill-cut; and Mark Lemon, Henry Mayhew, Henry Grattan, Joseph Allen, F.\r\nG. Tomlins, Gilbert à Beckett, and W. H. Wills (the biting epigram \"To\r\nthe Black-balled of the United Service Club,\" _i.e._ Lord Cardigan, was\r\nhis), all contributed to the first number. It is an axiom of newspaper\r\nconductors that \"the first number is always the worst number,\" and\r\n_Punch_ did nothing to disprove the rule. Nevertheless, it was a great\r\nsuccess. The tone and quality were far higher in dignity and excellence\r\nthan was common to an avowedly smart and comic paper--far different from\r\nwhat is suggested by the word \"Charivari;\" and the public admitted that\r\nhere was a novel school of comic writing, by a motley moralist and\r\npunning philosopher, and hailed with pleasure the advent of a \"New\r\nHumour.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COVER OF THE FIRST VOLUME OF _PUNCH_.\r\n\r\n(_Designed by A. S. Henning._)]\r\n\r\n\"Out came the first number,\" wrote Landells. \"I shall never forget the\r\nexcitement of that first number! It was so great that Mr. Mayhew, Mr.\r\nLemon, and myself, sat up all night at the printer's, waiting to see it\r\nprinted.\" When \"our Mr. Bryant,\" as the publisher was called, opened the\r\npublishing office on that memorable 17th of July, at 13, Wellington\r\nStreet, Strand, the unexpected demand for the paper raised the\r\nexpectations and enthusiasm of the confederates to the highest pitch.\r\nMayhew, with Hodder and Landells, walked up and down outside the office\r\nand in the neighbouring Strand, discussing the paper and its prospects,\r\nand constantly calling to hear from Bryant how things were progressing.\r\nAt news of each fresh thousand sold, their spirits rose, and their\r\nanxiety became satisfaction when the whole edition of five thousand had\r\nbeen taken up by the trade, and another like edition was called for,\r\nand, on the following day, was sold out. Ten thousand copies! Ten\r\nthousand proofs, they took it, of public sympathy and encouragement.\r\n\r\nSuch is the outline of _Punch's_ conception and birth, based on many\r\noriginal documents and a mass of evidence, as well as on the independent\r\ntestimony collected from survivors. In the words of Mr. Jabez Hogg,\r\n\"Landells and Henry Mayhew were certainly the founders\"--the former\r\nconceiving the idea of the paper which was presently established, and\r\nthe latter developing it, as set forth, according to his original\r\nviews--founding the tradition and personality of \"Mr. Punch,\" and\r\nconverting him from a mere strolling puppet, an irresponsible jester,\r\ninto the laughing philosopher and man of letters, the essence of all\r\nwit, the concentration of all wisdom, the soul of honour, the fountain\r\nof goodness, and the paragon of every virtue.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] An example of these amusing and confusing contentions is the\r\npopular--I might almost say classic--witticism which is often\r\nresurrected at the expense of _Punch_. Once in a company of choice\r\nspirits Somebody suggested, when \"our leading comic\" was being\r\ndiscussed, that it would surely be an original idea and a good\r\nspeculation to \"start a _comic_ Punch.\" Douglas Jerrold, says one\r\nwriter, aimed the dart at Mark Lemon. Mr. W. S. Gilbert, according to a\r\nworld-travelled newspaper paragraph, let off the gibe at his friend Mr.\r\nBurnand. Laman Blanchard, says another journalist, surprised Jerrold\r\ninto silence with the taunt. Mark Lemon, declares another, threatened\r\nhis proprietors with it in a moment of anger; while Mr. Walford told me\r\nthat it was certainly first spoken of by George Grossmith, senr., of\r\nhumorous memory. But Hodder and Vizetelly agree in fathering it on\r\nBlanchard's son, Sidney, at the time when Gilbert à Beckett's \"Comic\r\nBlackstone\" and comic histories were delighting all true connoisseurs of\r\nburlesque. Sidney Blanchard, Hodder reminds us, was possessed of a\r\nquaint wit, which was wont to deliver itself in a manner such as that in\r\nwhich he referred to a cashier who was never behind his desk when money\r\nwas to be paid out: \"Compared with him,\" said he, \"the eel is an\r\nadhesive animal.\"\r\n\r\n[2] This little conceit greatly pleased its author. He makes Mrs. Caudle\r\nexclaim, when protesting against her spouse's lapse into\r\nbilliards--\"There's the manly and athletic game of cribbage!\"\r\n\r\n[3] So ignorant were their immediate successors of the events I am\r\nrelating that in a letter written in confutation of the assertion that\r\nGilbert à Beckett had been an editor of _Punch_, Shirley Brooks said:\r\n\"From the first the editorship was in the hands of my predecessor, Mark\r\nLemon; the opening address was from his pen, and he was sole editor from\r\nJuly 17th, 1841 (the day of the birth of the publication) until May\r\n23rd, 1870, the day of his lamented death.\" In the Jubilee number of\r\n_Punch_ this misconception was confirmed upon the authority of this\r\nstatement of Shirley Brooks.\r\n\r\n[4] These prospectuses cost a penny for twenty; they are now worth a\r\nguinea each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_PUNCH'S_ EARLY PROGRESS AND VICISSITUDES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Reception of _Punch_--Early Struggles--Financial Help Invoked--The\r\n     First Almanac--Its Enormous Success--Transfer of _Punch_ to\r\n     Bradbury and Evans--Terms of Settlement--The New Firm--_Punch's_\r\n     Special Efforts--Succession of Covers--\"Valentines,\" \"Holidays,\"\r\n     \"Records of the Great Exhibition,\" and \"At the Paris Exhibition.\"\r\n\r\nThe public reception of the first number of _Punch_ was varied in\r\ncharacter. Mr. Watts, R.A., once told me that the paper was regarded\r\nwith but little encouragement by the occupants of an omnibus in which he\r\nwas riding, one gentleman, after looking gravely through its pages,\r\ntossing it aside with the remark, \"One of those ephemeral things they\r\nbring out; won't last a fortnight!\" Dr. Thompson, Master of Trinity,\r\ninformed Professor Herkomer that he, too, was riding in an omnibus on\r\nthe famous 17th of July, when he bought a copy from a paper-boy, and\r\nbegan to look at it with curiosity. When he chuckled at the quaint wit\r\nof the thing, \"Do you find it amusing, sir?\" asked a lady, who was\r\nobserving him narrowly. \"Oh, yes.\" \"I'm so glad,\" she replied; \"my\r\nhusband has been appointed editor; he gets twenty pounds a week!\" One\r\nmay well wonder who was this sanguine and trustful lady. Mr. Frith\r\ndescribes how, having overheard Joe Allen tell a friend, in the gallery\r\nof the Society of British Artists, to \"look out for our first number; we\r\nshall take the town by storm!\" he duly looked out, but was disappointed\r\nat finding nothing in it by Leech; and how when he went to a shop for\r\nthe second number, to see if his idol had drawn anything for it, the\r\nnewsman replied, \"'What paper, sir? Oh, _Punch_! Yes, I took a few of\r\nthe first number; but it's no go. You see, they billed it about a good\r\ndeal' (how well I recollect that expression!), 'so I wanted to see what\r\nit was like. It won't do; it's no go.'\"\r\n\r\nThe reception by the press was more encouraging--that is to say, by the\r\nprovincial press, for the London papers took mighty little notice of the\r\nnewcomer. The \"Morning Advertiser,\" it is true, quaintly declared in\r\npraise of the \"exquisite woodcuts, serious and comic,\" that they were\r\n\"executed in the first style of art, at a price so low that we really\r\nblush to name it;\" while the \"Sunday Times\" and a number of provincial\r\npapers of some slight account in their day professed astonishment at the\r\nabsence of grossness, partisanship, profanity, indelicacy, and malice\r\nfrom its pages. \"It is the first comic we ever saw,\" said the \"Somerset\r\nCounty Gazette,\" \"which was not vulgar. It will provoke many a hearty\r\nlaugh, but never call a blush to the most delicate cheek.\" They vied\r\nwith each other in their vocabulary of praise; and as to _Punch's_ quips\r\nand sallies, his puns, his propriety, his \"pencillings,\" and his\r\ncuts--they simply defied description; you just cracked your sides with\r\nlaughter at the jokes, and that was all about it.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding all this praise, the paper did not prosper; but\r\nwhether it was that the price did not suit the public, although the\r\n\"Advertiser\" really blushed to name it, or that _Punch_ had not yet\r\neducated his Party, cannot be decided. The support of the public did not\r\nlift it above a circulation of from five to six thousand, and on the\r\nappearance of the fifth number Jerrold muttered with a snort, \"I wonder\r\nif there will ever be a tenth!\" Everything that could be done to command\r\nattention, with the limited funds at disposal, was done. No sooner was\r\nLord Melbourne's Administration defeated and discredited (for the\r\nPremier was angrily denounced for hanging on to office), than _Punch_\r\ndisplayed a huge placard across the front of his offices inscribed, \"Why\r\nis _Punch_ like the late Government? Because it is JUST OUT!!\" And no\r\ndevice of the sort, or other artifice that could be suggested to the\r\nresourceful minds in _Punch's_ cabinet, was left untried. Things were\r\nagainst _Punch_. It was not only that the public was neglectful,\r\nunappreciative. There was prejudice to live down; there were stamp duty,\r\nadvertisement duty, and paper duty to stand up to; and there were no\r\nSmiths or Willings, or other great distributing agencies, to assist.\r\n\r\nWhile Bryant was playing his uphill game, _Punch_, written by educated\r\nmen, was doing his best not only to attract politicians and lovers of\r\nhumour and satire, but to enlist also the support of scholars, to whom\r\nat that time no comic paper had avowedly appealed; and it is doubtless\r\ndue to the assumption that his readers, like his writers, were gentlemen\r\nof education, that he quickly gained the reputation of being entitled to\r\na place in the library and drawing-room, diffusing, so to speak, an\r\nodour of culture even in those early days of his first democratic\r\nfervour. We had a German \"Punchlied,\" Greek Anakreontics, and plenty of\r\nLatin--not merely Leigh's mock-classic verses, but efforts of a higher\r\nhumour and a purer kind, such, among many more, as the \"Petronius,\" and\r\nthe clever interlinear burlesque translations of Horace which came from\r\nthe pen of H. A. Kennedy. Then \"Answers to Correspondents\" were\r\nmaintained for a while inside the wrapper, which were witty enough to\r\njustify their existence. But it was felt that something more was wanted\r\nto make the paper \"move;\" and the first \"Almanac\" was decided upon.\r\n\r\nThe circulation meanwhile had not risen above six thousand, and ten\r\nthousand were required to make the paper pay. Stationer and contributors\r\nhad all been paid, and \"stock\" was now valued at £250. That there was a\r\nconstant demand for these back numbers (on September 27th, 1841, for\r\nexample, £1 3s. 4-1/2d.-worth were sold \"over the counter\"), was held to\r\nprove that the work was worth pushing; but it seemed that for want of\r\ncapital it would go the way of many another promising concern. The\r\ndifficulties into which _Punch_ had fallen soon got noised abroad, and\r\noffers of assistance, not by any means disinterested, were not wanting\r\nto remind the stragglers of their position. Helping hands were certainly\r\nput out, but only that money might be dropped in. Then Last declined to\r\ngo on. He had neither the patience nor the speculative courage of the\r\nNorthumbrian engraver, and money had, not without great difficulty and\r\ndelay, been found to pay him for his share--which had hitherto been a\r\nshare only of loss. The firm of Bradbury and Evans had been looked to as\r\na _deus ex machinâ_ to take over the printing, and lift _Punch_ out of\r\nthe quagmire by acquiring Last's share and interest for £150. The offer\r\nwas entertained, and an agreement drafted on September 25th, when, on\r\nthe very same day, Bradbury and Evans wrote to withdraw, on the ground\r\nthat they found the proposed acquisition \"would involve them in the\r\nprobable loss of one of their _most valuable_ connections.\" Landells,\r\nwho always regarded this action--without any definite grounds that I can\r\ndiscover--as a diplomatic move to involve him and his friends still\r\nmore, so that more advantageous salvage terms might be made, hurriedly\r\ncast about for other succour, and alighted on one William Wood, printer,\r\nwho lent money, but whose agreement as a whole was not executed, as it\r\nwas considered \"either usurious or exorbitant\" by their solicitors, who\r\ncharacteristically concluded their bill thus:--\"Afterwards attending at\r\nthe office in Wellington Street to see as to making the tender, and to\r\nadvise you on the sufficiency thereof, but you were not there;\r\nafterwards attending at Mr. H. Mayhew's lodging, but he was out;\r\nafterwards attending at Mr. Lemon's, and he was out; and we were given\r\nto understand you had all gone to Gravesend\"--showing the one touch of\r\nnature which made all _Punch_-men kin.\r\n\r\nIn due course Landells acquired Last's share, and the printing was\r\nexecuted successively by Mr. Mitchell and by Mills, Jowett, and Mills,\r\nuntil it slid by a sort of natural gravitation into the hands of\r\nBradbury and Evans. Landells had endeavoured to interest his friends in\r\nthe paper, but soon discovered the fatal truth that one's closest\r\nfriends are never so close as when it is a question of money.\r\n\r\nThen came the Almanac, upon which were based many hopes that were\r\ndestined to be more than realised. It has hitherto been considered as\r\nthe work of Dr. Maginn, at that time, as at many others, an unwilling\r\nsojourner in a debtor's prison. But H. P. Grattan has since claimed the\r\ndistinction of being, like the doctor, an inmate of the retreat known as\r\nHer Majesty's Fleet, where he was visited by Henry Mayhew. Mayhew, he\r\nsaid, lived surreptitiously with him for a week, and during that time,\r\nwithout any assistance from Dr. Maginn, they brought the whole work to a\r\nbrilliant termination. Thirty-five jokes a day to each man's credit for\r\nseven consecutive days in the melancholy privacy of a prison cell is\r\ncertainly a very remarkable feat--hardly less so than the alleged fact\r\nthat Mayhew, who proposed the Almanac, as he proposed so many other good\r\nthings for _Punch_, should have gone to the incarcerated Grattan for\r\nsole assistance, when he and his co-editors had so many capable\r\ncolleagues at large. The claim does not deserve full credence,\r\nespecially in face of Landells' declaration that \"everyone engaged on it\r\nworked so admirably together, and it was done so well, that the town was\r\ntaken by surprise, and the circulation went up in that one week from\r\n6,000 to 90,000--an increase, I believe, unprecedented in the annals of\r\npublishing.\" The Almanac became at once the talk of the day; everybody\r\nhad read it, and a contemporary critic declared that its cuts \"would\r\nelicit laughter from toothache, and render gout oblivious of his toe.\"\r\n\r\nNow, although Bradbury and Evans had hesitated to become proprietors,\r\nthey had had no objection to act as printers and publishers, and when\r\nthe editors approached them they lent a ready ear. \"It was Uncle Mark,\"\r\nsaid \"Pater\" Evans at the \"Gentleman's Magazine\" dinner in 1868, \"who\r\nwas the chief conspirator when they brought _Punch_ to Whitefriars; it\r\nwas his eloquence alone that induced us to buy _Punch_. Jerrold did not\r\nsay much, but he supported his friend, you may be sure. They talked us\r\nover very easily.\" They bought the editors' share for £200, which they\r\nadvanced on the security of the whole. Into the circumstances of the\r\nsubsequent squabbles between Landells and the firm it is not needful to\r\nenter. He bitterly complained that he could obtain neither statements of\r\naccounts nor satisfactory arrangement, while the firm withheld their\r\nfavourable consideration of the agreements his solicitors sent them to\r\nsign. The negotiations proceeded wearily from April, 1842, to December\r\n24th, with rising wrath on the part of the good-hearted, impatient\r\nNorthumbrian, who could neither understand nor brook the repeated\r\ndelays, and fairly boiled over with indignation, suspicion, and wrath.\r\nIn despair, so Landells recorded, that his lawyers could get no\r\nsatisfaction, and yet \"not willing to put the whole thing into\r\nChancery,\" he blurted out that he should buy back Bradbury and Evans'\r\nshare or they acquire his. As cool business men they promptly asked his\r\nprice. He named £450, ultimately reducing it to £400, and further to\r\n£350, on the understanding, he says, that he should continue to act as\r\nengraver; and great were his anger and humiliation when he found after\r\nthe second week of the new _régime_ that the engraving was taken from\r\nhim. But it is only fair to say that in his lawyer's instructions there\r\nis evidence that Bradbury and Evans persistently declined to give up\r\ntheir freedom in the matter of the engraving. The transfer then took\r\nplace.[5] On December 23rd, 1842, the firm was already speaking with\r\nsome authority; the voice was the voice of the printers, but the tone\r\nwas the tone of proprietors. And that was the passing of _Punch_.\r\nEarlier in the year Landells had made an effort to save the paper by\r\npersuading those who worked for it to take shares. With a few he was\r\nsuccessful; others were less speculative, so the writer was informed by\r\nthe late H. G. Hine. \"Landells,\" he said, \"asked me to take a share in\r\nthe paper, but, not being a business man, I declined. When the paper\r\nchanged hands, Bradbury and Evans bought it for so small an increase on\r\nthe actual losses and debts, that each man, when the profits were\r\ndivided, received two-and-sixpence each.\" Not long after Landells ceased\r\nhis connection with _Punch_, Douglas Jerrold met Vizetelly, and\r\nacquainted him with the turn of the tide. \"_Punch_ is getting on all\r\nright now,\" he said; and added, in his saturnine way, \"It began to do so\r\nimmediately we threw that engraving Jonah overboard!\" Yet Jerrold was\r\nglad enough to take advantage of the engraving Jonah's influence the\r\nfollowing year, when Landells, with Herbert Ingram, N. Cooke, T.\r\nRoberts, W. Little, and R. Palmer started the \"Illuminated Magazine,\"\r\nand installed him as editor at a handsome salary.\r\n\r\nThe following page from Landells' rather rough-and-ready accounts will\r\ngive some idea of how financial matters stood between the parties at the\r\ntime of the transfer:--\r\n\r\n\r\n         B. & E.

The original Agreement between the original founders of _Punch_\r\n     already enumerated. This is dated July 14th, 1841--only three days\r\n     before the appearance of the paper. It is printed at length as\r\n     Appendix 1 to this volume.\r\n\r\n     2. Agreement between Bradbury and Evans and \"Punchites,\" whereby in\r\n     consideration of a loan of £150 the printing of the paper is\r\n     assured to the firm. This is dated Oct., 1841, the signatories\r\n     being E. Landells, Mark Lemon, Henry Mayhew, and Stirling Coyne,\r\n     with W. H. Wills and G. Windsor as witnesses.\r\n\r\n     3. The assignment to Landells of _Punch_ and the stock-in-trade by\r\n     Lemon, Mayhew, and Stirling Coyne. Dated December 6th, 1841.\r\n\r\n     4. Assignment to Bradbury and Evans by Landells of his two-thirds\r\n     share of _Punch_. Dated, July 25th, 1842.\r\n\r\n     5. Assignment of his remaining one-third to Bradbury and Evans by\r\n     Landells, in consideration of £100 cash and their acceptance for\r\n     £250 due Jan. 31st, 1843, their mortgage on this share to be\r\n     cancelled. This deed is dated Dec. 29th, 1842, and is in the terms\r\n     of Landells' letter of agreement of the previous 24th.]\r\n\r\nThe new proprietors, when they acquired their interest in _Punch_, were\r\nnot then distinguished publishers such as they soon became; they were\r\nessentially printers, and had few connections to assist them in making\r\nit into a paying property. They had, however, W. S. Orr & Co. (the\r\nLondon agents of Chambers, of Edinburgh), who had fallen into financial\r\ndifficulties, and looked to Bradbury and Evans to help them out; and\r\nthrough their organisation _Punch_ was taken up by the trade \"on sale or\r\nreturn.\" To work up the sale of a threepenny publication was at that\r\ntime a formidable task; but Orr certainly accomplished it, and for a\r\ntime _Punch_ undoubtedly owed more to his efforts than to Jerrold's pen\r\nor Leech's pencil. The head of the firm, in both senses, was William\r\nBradbury, the keenest man of business that ever trod the flags of Fleet\r\nStreet, and the founder of a dynastic line nearly as long and eminent as\r\nthat of John Murray himself. His portrait may be seen in _Punch_ more\r\nthan once--for example, in Tenniel's drawing of the Staff at play at the\r\nbeginning of Vol. XXVII, 1854, where his tall, imposing figure contrasts\r\nwith that of his partner, Frederick Mullett (\"Pater\") Evans, who appears\r\nwith shining spectacles, beaming countenance, and convex waistcoat.\r\nJolly old \"Pater,\" who died in 1870, was the model of Leech's\r\n_pater-familias_; and it is remembered to his credit that he never\r\nresented the liberty taken with him by Thackeray in \"The Kickleburys on\r\nthe Rhine.\" It has always been the graceful and feeling practice of\r\n_Punch_, ever since the death of Dr. Maginn, to whom a kindly obituary\r\nwas devoted in 1842, to do honour in his pages to each of his\r\nlieutenants as they drop out of the ranks, recognising misfortune and\r\ndeath--both \"devil's inventions,\" as Ruskin calls them--as toll-gates on\r\nthe path of life, with sorrow as the tax; so that these more solemn\r\narticles and mortuary elegies seem to mark the way, like milestones set\r\nby loving hands. To Evans one of these was raised, and we read in it\r\nthat \"they who inscribe these lines to his memory will never lament a\r\nmore kind, more genial, or more loyal friend.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: F. M. EVANS. WILLIAM H. BRADBURY.\r\nWILLIAM BRADBURY. F. M. (\"PATER\") EVANS.\r\n\r\n(_From Photographs by A. Bassano Limited._)]\r\n\r\nThe next head of the firm was William Hardwick Bradbury, who had been at\r\nschool with Mr. Justice Romer, the husband of Mark Lemon's daughter; and\r\nthe house then became Bradbury, Evans & Co. He married the daughter of\r\nMr. Thomas Agnew; and when, in 1872, Mr. F. M. Evans (the son of\r\n\"Pater\") left the firm, after having attended the Dinner for five years\r\nas the son of his father, and sat for another seven years at the tail of\r\nthe Table by right of proprietorship, the business was reinforced by the\r\ninclusion of the house of Agnew. It then became Bradbury, Agnew & Co.,\r\nand it has been thought that Sir William Agnew's personality has tended\r\nto colour _Punch_ up to a certain point with just a shade of his own\r\nLiberal political opinions. Messrs. W. H. Bradbury, William Agnew,\r\nThomas Agnew, and John Henry Agnew were then the members of the firm,\r\nwhich a few years since was converted into a limited company; and on the\r\ndeath of the first-named, Mr. W. Lawrence Bradbury took his father's\r\nplace as managing head of the house, with Mr. Philip Agnew as colleague:\r\nyoung men, surely, to succeed to the direction of a house which had been\r\nthe publisher of Thackeray and Dickens, founders of \"The Field,\" \"The\r\nArmy and Navy Gazette,\" printers of the \"Family Herald\" and \"London\r\nJournal,\" of the \"Daily News,\" the \"English Encyclopedia,\" and other\r\nhuge undertakings. With the advent of the younger generation came some\r\nof those technical alterations and improvements which have brought the\r\nproduction of _Punch_ abreast of the times; but the older traditions, in\r\nparticular that great institution of the _Punch_ Dinner, have been\r\nreverently and lovingly retained in all their admirable features.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS AGNEW. JOHN HENRY AGNEW.\r\nSIR WILLIAM AGNEW, BART. PHILIP L. AGNEW. W. LAWRENCE BRADBURY.\r\n\r\n(_From Photographs by A. Bassano, Limited._)]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that after the striking success of the experiment\r\nthe Almanac became a permanent annual institution. Into so important a\r\npublication did it develop, commercially speaking, that a special\r\n\"Almanac Dinner\" has up to recent years always been considered\r\nnecessary, at which its chief contents are arranged, just as at the\r\nordinary weekly Dinner. Hine, Kenny Meadows, and others assisted in the\r\nproduction of the first two or three Almanacs; but after that, and for\r\nmany years, practically the whole of the illustrative work usually fell\r\non the broad and entirely competent shoulders of John Leech, especially\r\nafter Doyle's secession. From time to time experiments have been made in\r\nthe direction of novelty. Thus in 1848, in consequence of the great\r\npopularity of the issue, a luxurious edition was prepared, at the price\r\nof five shillings for the coloured and half that sum for the uncoloured\r\ncopies, wherein, it was claimed, \"full effect is given to the artists'\r\ndesigns.\" It was certainly an imposing affair, with meadows of margin,\r\nand printed on one side only of the thick paper; and it now commands a\r\nprice in the bookshops of five or six times its original cost.\r\n\r\nHumour for private as well as for public consumption has always been a\r\nrule in the _Punch_ circle; and in 1865, a year in which influenza colds\r\nwere extremely prevalent, this pleasing faculty was given full scope.\r\nMost of the Staff that Christmas were afflicted with severe colds; so\r\nwith amiable consideration the copies of the Almanac provided for them\r\nand for some of the chief contributors were printed upon linen--lest\r\ntheir supply of handkerchiefs should run short. They were charming and\r\ncheerful in appearance, being handsomely bound and stitched with red,\r\nand presented unusual advantages in the way of utility and\r\nentertainment. Of recent years the Almanacs have had admirably drawn\r\nwrappers, specially designed. In 1882 Mr. Burnand tested the powers of\r\nour humorous painters outside, in addition to _Punch's_ own Staff,\r\nincluding Mr. Stacy Marks, R.A., Mr. G. A. Storey, A.R.A., and Sir John\r\nGilbert, R.A.; but the result was an argument in favour of Staff-work\r\nover outside contribution. Among other experiments, colour was tried\r\nwith a view to rendering further homage to Sir John Tenniel's cartoon,\r\nby printing it on a tinted background, in the manner of Matt Morgan's\r\nfamous designs in the \"Tomahawk.\" But the idea, which originated with\r\nthe late Mr. Bradbury, did not answer expectations, and the attempt was\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nThe success that immediately attended the Almanac naturally attracted\r\nthe attention of the pirates, and hatched the brood of spurious and\r\ncoarse imitations given forth by such notorious printers and publishers\r\nas Goode, Lloyd, and Lyle. But _Punch_ had a short legal way with him\r\nthat soon scared them off, and the merry Hunchback is now left supreme\r\nin his own sphere. He not only, as the \"Times\" said, \"commences the\r\nwinter season for us with the 'Almanac,' but he continues the tradition\r\nof Charles Dickens by retaining for Christmastide much of the fine\r\nhearty old flavour which the great novelist imparted to it--that jovial,\r\ntender, charitable, roast-goose spirit that exhales from it, the Spirits\r\nof Christmas Present and Christmas Past.\" \"Christmas without the\r\nChristmas number of _Punch_,\" exclaimed the \"Saturday Review\" not long\r\nago, \"would be a Christmas without plum-pudding, mince-pies, turkey, and\r\nchildren's parties--it would not be Christmas at all!\"\r\n\r\nAnother result of the constant search for freshness was the changing of\r\nthe design on the cover of each consecutive volume. Any change from that\r\nof Henning could only be a change for the better, so a second\r\napplication was made to Hablôt Knight Browne (\"Phiz\") for his\r\ncollaboration. Well satisfied by this time with the tone of the paper,\r\nhe gladly responded. The result was a refined and artistic page, crowded\r\nwith figures, rather graceful and quaint than funny; and although, to\r\nLeech's horror, a barrel-organ figured in it, it served its purpose\r\nadmirably.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PUNCH'S_ SECOND WRAPPER, DESIGNED BY \"PHIZ.\" JANUARY,\r\n1842.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROPOSED WRAPPER FOR THIRD VOLUME. SKETCH BY H. G. HINE.\r\nNOT ADOPTED.]\r\n\r\nFor the next volume a sketch was made by H. G. Hine, based on a slighter\r\none by Landells. It was not used, however, as intended, but adapted as\r\nthe index-heading; and William Harvey, the Shakespearian illustrator,\r\nwas requested to undertake a design to replace it. This, though yet\r\nmore graceful than Browne's, was less suitable than ever. Babes like\r\n_amorini_ toying with Punch's cap and _bâton_, bells and mask, were very\r\npretty and charming, but a good deal too much in the style of Rubens or\r\nStothard; and what was thought more unsuitable still was the price. Mr.\r\nBirket Foster has borne witness to the consternation in the office when\r\nthe charge of twelve guineas was sent in with the design--nearly half\r\nthe total capital with which Landells a year before had begun the\r\nconcern!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PUNCH'S_ THIRD WRAPPER, DESIGNED BY WILLIAM HARVEY.\r\nJULY, 1842.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PUNCH'S_ FOURTH WRAPPER.

JANUARY, 1844.]\r\n\r\nSix months later Sir John Gilbert--then a youth doing great things for\r\nthe \"Illustrated London News\"--was commissioned to draw another front\r\npage. This was subsequently used until recent years as the pink cover\r\nof _Punch's_ monthly parts. A cover was produced by Kenny Meadows, and\r\nthen for January, 1844, Richard Doyle, the latest recruit, whose merit\r\nhad been quickly gauged, was employed to execute the new one. This\r\nwrapper was far more in accord with the true spirit of _Punch_. More\r\nsportive and rollicking, and with less attempt at grace, it threw over\r\nthe style of the \"Newcastle School\"--of which Landells was a\r\nmember--and gave the general idea of the latest of all covers. This was\r\nnot executed until January, 1849, when several changes of detail were\r\nmade, including the substitution of the smug lion's head for that of\r\nJudy in the canvas--the whole so successful that it may safely be\r\npredicted that it will never be superseded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PUNCH'S_ SIXTH AND LAST WRAPPER, DESIGNED BY RICHARD\r\nDOYLE. SECOND DESIGN. JANUARY, 1849.]\r\n\r\nSuch are the covers--comprising what Mr. W. Bradbury used to call \"our\r\nwardrobe of old coats\"--which, though interesting enough in themselves,\r\ncertainly included nothing to equal the last design, by which Doyle's\r\nname is best known throughout the artistic world.\r\n\r\nGuided by the success of the first Almanac, the conductors decided to\r\nwork the same oracle by publishing \"extra numbers\" at every promising\r\nopportunity. \"Mr. Mayhew, Mr. Jerrold, and I,\" says Landells, \"happened\r\nto spend a few days in the summer at Herne Bay, and there '_Punch's_\r\nVisit to the Watering Places' was projected. These articles gave _Punch_\r\nanother great lift. Messrs. Mayhew, Mark Lemon, Douglas Jerrold, and I,\r\ndid Herne Bay, Margate, Broadstairs, and Ramsgate, and I never enjoyed\r\nmyself more than on this, to me, memorable occasion. Albert Smith did\r\nBrighton. _Punch_ thenceforth became an established favourite with the\r\npublic, and the weekly circulation averaged over 30,000.\"\r\n\r\nJust before this lucky stroke, another not less fortunate as a _succes\r\nd'estime_, if nothing more, was \"_Punch's_ Valentines\"--at that time\r\nconsidered a most remarkable production; for there were no fewer than\r\ntwelve half-page engravings within its full-page borders--a generous\r\namount that puzzled the public far more than ten times as much and as\r\ngood would do to-day. Kenny Meadows, \"Phiz,\"[6] Leech, Crowquill,\r\nHenning, and Newman, contributed each two \"valentines,\" which were\r\naddressed to various sorts and conditions of people, accompanied by\r\nverses of considerable humour and more than average merit. Thus, to the\r\nlawyer--whom \"Phiz\" has represented as a mixture, in equal parts, of\r\nSqueers, Brass, and Quilp--the lines begin in a manner not unworthy of\r\nHood himself:--\r\n\r\n  \"Lend me your ears, thou man of law,\r\n  While I my declaration draw,\r\n      Your heart in fee surrender;\r\n  As plaintiff I my suit prefer,\r\n  'Twould be uncivil to demur,\r\n      Then let your plea be--tender.\"\r\n\r\nThe invocation which follows, to a gorgeous footman, by some\r\nlove-smitten serving-maid, ends--\r\n\r\n  \"But now fare thee well!--with your ultimate breath,\r\n  When you answer the door to the knocking of Death,\r\n  On your conscience, believe me, 'twill terribly dwell,\r\n  If now you refuse to attend to the _belle_!\"\r\n\r\nIn August, 1850, in the extra number called \"_Punch's_ Holidays,\" that\r\nwas done for the outskirts of London which eight years before had been\r\ndone for the watering-places. It was illustrated by Leech and Doyle,\r\nand, it may be added, the Hampton Court section was written by\r\nThackeray. Then when the great Shakespeare Tercentenary was being\r\ncelebrated, with singularly little _éclat_ so far as the Shakespeare\r\nCommittee itself was concerned, _Punch_ produced his \"Tercentenary\r\nNumber.\" It was in all respects admirable, and Tenniel's double-page\r\ncartoon was a striking success--as might have been expected from a Staff\r\nso remarkably well versed in Shakespeare. In that cartoon the poet's\r\ntriumphal car, drawn by twin Pegasi and driven by Mr. Punch, is followed\r\nby a motley procession, in which Mark Lemon, in the character of John\r\nBull, appears adapted as Prospero (one of the best of the many portraits\r\nof the editor that have appeared in the paper), while a typically\r\nmalignant organ-grinder is Caliban, and all the leading statesmen and\r\nsovereigns are represented in Shakespearian character appropriate to the\r\ncircumstances; the \"Standard\" and \"Morning Herald,\" two of _Punch's_ pet\r\naversions and journalistic butts, bringing up the rear as the Witches in\r\n\"Macbeth,\" Mesdames Gamp and Harris. The illustrators of this\r\nexceptionally happy number were--besides Sir John Tenniel--Charles\r\nKeene, Mr. du Maurier, and Mr. Fairfield.\r\n\r\nThen came the unwieldy \"Records of the Great Exhibition, extracted from\r\n_Punch_\" on October 4th, 1851. _Punch_ had made a dead-set against the\r\nexhibition in Hyde Park (until his friend Paxton was appointed its\r\narchitect, subsequently earning £20,000 by the work), and, according to\r\nMr. Justin McCarthy, \"was hardly ever weary of making fun of it ... and\r\nnothing short of complete success could save it from falling under a\r\nmountain of ridicule. The Prince did not despair, however, and the\r\nproject went on.\" And when it was a _fait accompli_, _Punch_, good man\r\nof business that he was, at once put it to the best possible advantage,\r\nby issuing his enormous \"extra\" of nine previously-published cartoons by\r\nTenniel and Leech, and many other cuts besides--the whole, in point of\r\nits double-folio size, more suitable for street display than library\r\nreading. The price was sixpence, and with all the special matter it\r\ncontained it was one of the cheapest productions ever issued from that\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nWith the special Paris Exhibition number, produced in celebration of the\r\nExhibition of 1889, the list of extra numbers issued by _Punch_ for\r\ngeneral circulation comes to a close. Nearly the whole of the Staff,\r\nincluding the proprietors, travelled to Paris together--how luxuriously,\r\nMr. Furniss's drawing of their dining-saloon gives a good notion; it\r\ncontains (with Sir John Tenniel and Mr. Lucy) portraits of all who were\r\npresent. Charles Keene had stayed at home; he felt unequal to the jaunt,\r\nand was, in fact, sickening for the mortal illness which soon had him in\r\nits grip. The \"Paris Sketches\" in the number that bear his signature\r\nwere--like the \"war correspondence from the front\" concocted in Fleet\r\nStreet--quietly drawn at home down at Chelsea. One thing primarily the\r\nnumber showed: that _Punch's_ national prejudices have mellowed with\r\ntime, and that a Frenchman may be accepted as a cultivated gentleman and\r\na genial companion--a very different being to him whom Leech habitually\r\ndrew as a flabby-faced refugee in Leicester Square, \"with _estaminet_\r\nclearly written across his features,\" while Thackeray applauded the\r\nconception in his most righteous hatred and contempt for all things\r\nvile.\r\n\r\nTwo other special means has _Punch_ adopted with the view of pleasing\r\nhis constituents and confounding his enemies, exclusive of the mock\r\nMulready envelope known as the \"Anti-Graham Envelope\" and the \"Wafers,\"\r\nwhich are elsewhere referred to. The first of these was the music\r\noccasionally printed in his pages from the hand of his own particular\r\nmaestro, Tully, the well-known member of the _Punch_ Club, whose musical\r\nsetting of \"The Queen's Speech, as it is to be sung by the Lord\r\nChancellor,\" appeared in 1843; the polka, at the time when that dance\r\nwas a novel and a national craze, dedicated to the well-known\r\ndancing-master, Baron Nathan; \"_Punch's_ Mazurka,\" in Vol. VIII. (1845);\r\nand one or two other pieces besides. The other was a coloured picture\r\nrepresenting a \"plate\"--a satire on the poor and inartistic \"coloured\r\nplates\" then being issued by S. C. Hall's \"Art Union.\" It was a clever\r\nlithographic copy of an ordinary \"willow pattern\" plate; a homely piece\r\nof crockery, broken and riveted, beneath which is inscribed: \"To the\r\nSubscribers to the Art Union this beautiful plate (from the original in\r\nthe possession of the Artist) is presented, as the finest specimen of\r\nBritish Art, by _Punch_.\" It was designed by Horace Mayhew; but the\r\nedition was extremely limited--not a hundred copies, it is\r\nunderstood--on account of the expense, which it was thought was not\r\njustified by the excellence or the likely popularity of the joke.\r\n\r\nSuch have been some of _Punch's_ efforts outside the usual routine, and\r\nthe result has been the continual popularisation of the paper. Volume\r\nafter volume, too, in various forms, has been republished, culminating\r\nin the \"Victorian Era,\" \"Pictures from _Punch_,\" and \"Sir John Tenniel's\r\nCartoons;\" and each one has but served to attract the favourable notice\r\nof the public to the ordinary issue. So _Punch_ has developed his power\r\nand his resources. To him one might almost apply what a Welshman said of\r\nhis friend: \"I knew him when he wass a ferry poor man--quite a poor man\r\nwalking about in the village; and now he drives in his carriage and\r\ntwice!\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] When the purchase was completed, a curious making-up of accounts\r\nproceeded between the parties as to the wood-blocks which were to\r\naccompany the paper. These accounts, referring to the titles of the\r\nengravings, read curiously enough. Here is a specimen:--\r\n\r\n\r\n No. 22.                                     £12 10 6\r\n Deduct Collared Beef                             4 6\r\n                                             ---  ---\r\n                                                              £12 6 0\r\n\r\n No. 25.\r\n\r\n Brown's wrapper (_i.e._ Frontispiece\r\n drawn by \"Phiz\"--Hablôt\r\n K.

For\r\nthree-and-fifty years have these illustrious functions been held, fifty\r\nto the year. And those two thousand six hundred and fifty meals mark\r\noff, week by week, the progress of English humour during the Victorian\r\nera--not the humour of literature alone, but the humour, as well as the\r\ntechnical excellence, of one of the noblest and most vigorous and\r\ndelightful of all the sections of English art.\r\n\r\nThis solemn festivity, therefore, has a solid claim to being included\r\namong the scenes of English artist-life. If it be conceded, as I think\r\nit must, that _Punch_ has been for half a century an effective, even a\r\nglorious, school of art--of drawing in black-and-white and of\r\nwood-cutting alike--it follows that the weekly repast which has helped\r\nto bring these things about claims attention and respect among the Diets\r\nof the world, and demands a first place in virtue of public service and\r\nby right of artistic performance.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in the spirit nor with the fashionable view of the Royal\r\nAcademicians and their imposing banquet that the members of the _Punch_\r\nstaff hold their weekly junket. \"We English,\" said Douglas Jerrold,\r\n\"would dine to celebrate the engulfing of England.\" Yet if \"the\r\nPunchites\" share the feeling of old Timon that \"we must dine together,\"\r\nit is neither for purposes of self-congratulation, nor yet of\r\nhospitality. Though good-fellowship is near the genesis of the\r\ninstitution, work and serious aim are at the root of it all, and in the\r\nmidst of all the merry-making are never for a moment forgotten.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, conviviality, you may be sure, counted for something in\r\nthe arrangement when Queen Victoria's reign was young. Clubs there were\r\nnot a few about Fleet Street and the Strand, where the men who founded\r\n_Punch_, and their friends and enemies alike in similar walks of life,\r\nwould hob-nob together, and where the sharp concussions of their\r\ndiamond-cut-diamond wit would emit the sparks and flashes that were\r\nremembered and straightway converted into \"copy.\" In those early days\r\nthe flow of soul was closely regulated by the flow of liquor, and the\r\nmost modest of Dinners was food at once to body and to mind. \"What\r\nthings,\" wrote Beaumont in his Letter to Ben Jonson--\r\n\r\n               \"What things have we seen\r\n  Done at the 'Mermaid'! Heard words that have been\r\n  So nimble and so full of subtile flame,\r\n  As if that every one from whom they came\r\n  Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest,\r\n  And resolved to live a fool the rest\r\n  Of his dull life.\"\r\n\r\nAs in Elizabethan times, so in the days of Victoria. The _Punch_\r\nDinners of the last few decades would, in their excellence and\r\nrefinement, have astonished the merry crew of old; but the entertainment\r\nis now but the prelude to business, and not, as in the earlier\r\nstruggling months, the powder that served to fire off the great guns of\r\nhumour. The weekly Dinner was evolved from the gatherings that were held\r\nnearly every evening, as well as Saturday-nightly, in the anxious days\r\nthat preceded--and immediately succeeded, too--the laboured birth of\r\n_Punch_. The first of these--the very first \"_Punch_ Dinner,\" strictly\r\nso-called--was held at \"La Belle Sauvage,\" Ludgate Hill, on the spot now\r\noccupied by the publishing firm of Cassell and Company. Hine was one of\r\nthose present at this historic feast, having been already impressed by\r\nLandells into the service of the paper. I may add, as a matter of minor\r\nhistory, that Mr. Price, the owner of the hostelry, advertised his house\r\nin the early numbers of _Punch_: a fact which suggests (perhaps\r\nunjustly) a mysterious financial understanding on the score of his\r\nbill--especially as Mr. Price was a brother-in-law of Bradbury the\r\nFirst. These tavern repasts were soon divided up between those who\r\nwished to work and those who wished to play; and the _Punch_ Dinner and\r\nthe \"_Punch_ Club\" were in due course established as separate\r\ninstitutions. For all that, the meetings of both were held in the \"Crown\r\nInn\" in Vinegar Yard, just off Drury Lane, and the \"Club\" was not\r\nlong after (1843) celebrated in the pages of _Punch_ itself by\r\nthe \"Professor,\" Percival Leigh, in his choicest dog-Latin--his most\r\nelegant _latin de cuisine_--or, as he himself called it,\r\n\"Anglo-Græco-Canino-Latinum.\" The lines, a parody of Goldsmith's\r\n\"Retaliation,\" begin thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"Sunt quidam jolly dogs, Saturday qui nocte frequentant\r\n  Antiqui [Greek: Stefanon] qui stat prope moenia Drurî,\r\n  [Greek: Boulomenoi] cum prog distendere rather,\r\n  Indulgere jocis, necnon Baccho atque tobacco...\"\r\n\r\n--lines which, with a few of the succeeding ones, I may render thus, the\r\nspirit and the text being followed as closely as may be:--\r\n\r\n  \"Some jolly dogs on Saturdays at fall of night are fain\r\n  To haunt the 'Crown' beside old Drury, hard by Drury Lane;\r\n  Their object, to expand themselves with dainties of the feed\r\n  And give the hour to jest and wine, and smoke the fragrant weed.\r\n  Such fellows, sure, ne'er graced before that jovial mundane hole.\r\n  To them I sing this song of praise--those mighty men of soul,\r\n  Whose fame henceforth shall spread abroad, so long as time shall roll.\r\n\r\n  \"The 'Crown' stands in a quiet yard, yet near the noisy street;\r\n  'Tis their local habitation--in its dining-room they meet.\r\n  The massive table, brightly spread, groans with the mighty feast.\r\n  The viands change. To-day 'tis beef with Yorkshire pudding dressed;\r\n  Next week perchance the dish that Hodge will grinningly define\r\n  As 'leg o' mutton, boiled, with trimmings.' Heartily they dine.\r\n  Here flows the Double X, and flows the Barclay-Perkins brew;\r\n  Nor is there lack of modern sack that best is known to you\r\n  When waiters call it 'off-n-off'--which waiters mostly do.\"\r\n\r\nHere it was that the wits of pen and pencil first laid their heads\r\ntogether in the service of Mr. Punch; and when they left for more\r\nprivate, if not more venerable, quarters, the room was occupied, first,\r\nby comrades of the same order of wit--among whom Augustus Mayhew, James\r\nHannay, Watts Phillips, and others started a short-lived comic\r\nbroad-sheet called \"The Journal for Laughter;\" and then by \"The Reunion\r\nClub\"--a côterie which, in 1857, was to become far more widely known\r\nunder the style and title of the \"Savage Club.\" It was situated next\r\ndoor to the \"Whistling Oyster,\" and faced a side entrance to Drury Lane\r\nTheatre--a fairly large first-floor room, looking larger by reason of\r\nits low ceiling, but well lighted by its three high windows. When I\r\nvisited it in 1893, the wooden staircase had been replaced by a steep\r\nstone-way; but the approach and the ascent were still steep enough to\r\nmake one wonder how the portly Lemon could, without difficulty or fear\r\nof accident, scale the classic heights, and twist his body to the\r\nneedful turns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PUNCH'S_ FIRST DINING-ROOM, \"CROWN INN,\" VINEGAR YARD.]\r\n\r\nAlthough, as I have said, conviviality and convenience were essentially\r\nidentified with the _Punch_ Dinner, especially in its embryonic stage,\r\nwhen frequent interviews were necessary and the daily occupations of\r\nmany of the Staff precluded an earlier attendance, it was quickly seen\r\nthat the chief practical use and effect of the Dinner was to broaden the\r\nmen's view of things, to produce harmony of tone and singleness of aim,\r\nto keep the Editor constantly in touch with his whole Staff, and through\r\nthem with the public; and thus to secure the fullest advantage which\r\ntheir combined wit and counsel could afford. When the transfer of the\r\npaper was completed from Ebenezer Landells to the house of Bradbury and\r\nEvans, the regular Dinners were soon established at No. 11, Bouverie\r\nStreet, E.C., now given over to the Posts and Telegraphs. The second\r\nfloor was considered not too undignified for the purpose; but the\r\ndescent to the first was made in good time, Mark Lemon taking the\r\nvacated room for his editorial office; and when in 1867 a general\r\nremoval was effected to No. 10, the present dining-room--or\r\nBanqueting-Hall, as it was finely called--was specially constructed for\r\nits high purpose. At first these repasts were held on Saturday night,\r\nwhen the paper was made up and sent away to press. But when the true\r\nvalue of the meetings became apparent, the day was changed to Wednesday.\r\nThe Dinner was established ostensibly for the discussion and determining\r\nof the \"big cut,\" and the function became as exclusive and esoteric as a\r\nMasonic initiation. From that day to this it has, with few exceptions,\r\nbeen held _januis clausis_; and beside it the Literary Ladies' Dinner\r\nand Bluebeard's Chamber are as open to the world and free from mystery\r\nas the public streets at noon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PUNCH'S_ PRESENT DINING-HALL IN BOUVERIE STREET,\r\nWHITEFRIARS.]\r\n\r\nThe room in which it was held, so long the Temple of the Comic Muse, had\r\nlittle in itself to command the attention of the superficial observer.\r\nThe stairs which Thackeray trod, and which resounded to the quick light\r\nstep of Jerrold and to the heavier tread of Leech, exist no longer; but\r\nthe classic shrine is practically as it was when the \"Fat Contributor,\"\r\npushing roughly past the young 'prentice engraver who opened the door to\r\nhis ring, gave no thought to him who was soon to make the name of\r\nBirket Foster famous in the land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARK LEMON'S MONOGRAM, CUT ON THE _PUNCH_ TABLE.]\r\n\r\nTo-day a large--one might say an imposing--apartment on the first floor\r\nlooking upon the street is approached, as most front offices in London\r\nCity are approached, from a landing leading through an open office. Upon\r\nthe table are a water-jug and a couple of goblets of cheap and\r\ndistinctly unlovely Bohemian glass. A tobacco-box, hardly less ugly\r\n(coëval, one would say, with the room itself), a snuff-box, and long\r\npipes serve to recall that respect for the past and for tradition which\r\nis one of the most delightful, as it is one of the most successful,\r\nelements in _Punch's_ composition. Here you may see Sir John Tenniel's\r\nlong churchwarden, with his initials marked upon it, and Charles Keene's\r\nlittle pipe--for these two men would ever prefer a stem between their\r\nteeth to a cigar-stump. Statuettes in plaster of John Leech and of\r\nThackeray, by Sir Edgar Boehm, as well as a bust of Douglas Jerrold,\r\ndecorate the mantelpiece or the dwarf-cupboard; and on the walls are\r\nmany frames of abiding interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERCIVAL LEIGH'S MONOGRAM.]\r\n\r\nHere you have the portraits of the four editors--that of Mark Lemon\r\npainted by Fred Chester, son of his life-long friend George Chester, and\r\nthe likenesses of Shirley Brooks, Tom Taylor, and Mr. Burnand in\r\nphotography. The portraits of the Staff, taken by Bassano in 1891 at Mr.\r\nWilliam Agnew's request, to the number of fourteen or fifteen, hang\r\nseparately in their dark frames. The original of one of Tenniel's\r\nAlmanac designs; a masterly drawing, two feet long, by Keene, bought by\r\nthe late Mr. Bradbury at a sale--the (unused) cartoon of Disraeli\r\nleading the principal financiers of the day in hats and frock-coats\r\nacross the Red Sea (\"Come along, it's getting shallower\"); the original\r\nof Leech's celebrated \"Mr. Punch's Fancy Ball,\" and a series of the\r\nenlarged coloured prints of his hunting sketches; a caricature of Mr.\r\nFurniss by Mr. Sambourne, made in Paris; another of Mr. Sambourne by Mr.\r\nFurniss; and a third of Mr. Sambourne by himself; a caricature in\r\npen-and-ink and colour of the _Punch_ Staff marching along in Paris, by\r\nMr. Furniss; a black-and-white sketch by the same artist of the same\r\ndistinguished company in the train on the return journey; and another\r\nsouvenir of the Paris trip by Mr. du Maurier, including the portraits of\r\nhimself, Mr. Burnand, Mr. Arthur à Beckett, and Mr. W. Bradbury. The\r\ntrophy-frame of specimen proofs of some of the finest of Swain's cuts of\r\nthe artistic Staff's best work, gathered together for show in one of the\r\ngreat exhibitions, has been removed to make room for photographs of\r\nGilbert à Beckett, \"Ponny\" (Horace) Mayhew, Charles Keene, Tom Taylor,\r\nPercival Leigh, Charles H. Bennett, R. F. Sketchley, John Henry Agnew,\r\nThomas Agnew and William Bradbury, Mr. Fred Evans and Sir William Agnew;\r\nwhile photographic groups of the Staff and a fine autotype of Thackeray\r\ncomplete the wall decoration of one of the most interesting apartments\r\nin London City.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN LEECH'S INITIALS AND CYPHER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. M. THACKERAY'S MONOGRAM]\r\n\r\nAnd in the corner, on the locker farthest from the street, besides a\r\nlittle _papier-mâché_ figure of a Japanese Punch--sent by an admirer in\r\nthe Land of the Rising Sun--and a group charmingly modelled from Sir\r\nJohn Tenniel's beautiful cartoon of \"Peace and the New Year,\" stands the\r\nstatue of the Great Hunchback himself, which in a fit of enthusiasm a\r\nyoung German sculptor, named Adolph Fleischmann, wrought and presented\r\nto the object of his admiration. It is a work of no little grotesqueness\r\nand ingenuity (well modelled and coloured, and fitted with springs that\r\npermit of the working of arms and eyes and head), which, endowed with a\r\nwhite favour, has played its part in the decoration of the publishing\r\noffice on the occasion of certain royal weddings and public rejoicing,\r\nand during the blocking of Fleet Street has been utilised in the\r\ndirection of comic self-advertisement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORACE MAYHEW'S INITIALS.]\r\n\r\nThen there is a real \"Royal Patent\" appropriately framed, \"hereby\r\nappointing Master Punch unto the Place and Quality of Joke Maker\r\nExtraordinary to her Majesty,\" duly signed and sealed by the Lord\r\nChamberlain, and countersigned \"J. A. N. D. Martin.\" It is undoubtedly a\r\ngenuine certificate--up to a point; but how it was obtained, and how\r\n_Punch's_ name came to be filled in, remains to this day a mystery. Such\r\nis the room, with its pleasant decoration of red and black and gold,\r\nwith its large windows and its sunlight gaselier; but, take it for all\r\nin all, it is about as unlike Mr. Sambourne's classic representation of\r\nthe Roman atrium in his Jubilee drawing as well could be imagined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOM TAYLOR'S INITIALS.]\r\n\r\nAnd the Table itself--_the_ Table--the famous board of which we all have\r\nheard, yet none, or but very few of us, have seen--I myself amongst the\r\nfortunate few! As a piece of furniture this hospitable, but rather\r\nprimitive, piece of joinery is not of much account, the top being of\r\nplain deal (_pace_ Thackeray's \"_Mahogany_ Tree\"), oblong in shape, with\r\nrounded ends. But its associations render it a treasure among treasures,\r\na rich and priceless gem. For at this Table nearly every man upon the\r\nStaff has, from the day it was made, sat and carved his initials upon\r\nit with a penknife, when officially elevated to _Punch's_ peerage. As\r\neach has died, his successor has taken his place--just as the Institut\r\nde France creates Immortals to fill the chairs made vacant by death--and\r\nhe has cut his initials or his mark close by those of the men who\r\noccupied the place before him. There they are, staring at you from the\r\nTable like so many abecedarian skeletons at the feast; and if you take a\r\nfurtive and hasty peep from the doorway and lift the green protective\r\ncloth you catch sight nearest you of a \"D. M.\" in close company with a\r\nbeautifully-cut \"W. M. T.\" and a monogrammatic leech inside a bottle\r\nflanked by a J. and an L.; and you gaze with deep interest on the\r\nhandiwork of them and of the rest, many of whom have carved their names,\r\nas on that Table, deep into England's roll of fame; and of others, too,\r\nwho, with less of genius but equal zeal and effort, have a strong claim\r\non the gratitude and the recollection of a kindly and laughter-loving\r\npeople.[7]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR JOHN TENNIEL'S MONOGRAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIRLEY BROOKS' MONOGRAM.]\r\n\r\nFor more than forty years, then, this Table has week by week, with few\r\nexceptions, been surrounded by the Staff of the day; and the chair, the\r\nself-same old-fashioned wooden editorial armchair, has been filled by\r\nthe reigning Editor. \"With few exceptions,\" I said; for Bouverie Street\r\nhas not invariably been the hatching-place of the Cartoon, nor have its\r\nwalls resounded with absolute regularity to the laughter and the jests\r\nof the merry-makers. During the summer the Dinner has been, now and\r\nagain, and still is, held at Greenwich, at Richmond, Maidenhead, or\r\nelsewhere--Hampton Court and Dulwich rather frequently of old, as well\r\nas once at Harrow, and sometimes at Purfleet, Windsor, and Rosherville.\r\nSometimes, when occasion has demanded--in the \"dead season,\" maybe, when\r\nthe attendance at the Table has dwindled, though for no sustained period\r\n(it is even on record that the \"Dinner\" has consisted of a _tête-à-tête_\r\nbetween Sir John Tenniel and Mr. Arthur à Beckett)--not more than three\r\nor four consecutive weeks, certainly--the \"Sussex,\" or more often the\r\nold \"Bedford Hotel,\" or latterly the \"First Avenue,\" has been the scene\r\nof the feast; while \"special dinners\" (and they have been many) have\r\nbeen held in special places. And not invariably has the weekly repast\r\nbeen a \"dinner\" at all, be it observed; for on certain rare occasions,\r\nwhen some important Parliamentary matter has intervened, a luncheon has\r\nbeen held instead. Once, in September, 1845, it was postponed from the\r\nSaturday night at the intercession of Charles Dickens, so that a new\r\nplay by Macready might be produced with the full advantage of the\r\n_Punch_ men's presence. And the Dinner was once more made a movable\r\nfeast, and was held on the Tuesday instead of the Wednesday, on the\r\noccasion of the production of Mr. Burnand's and Sir Arthur Sullivan's\r\nopera of \"The Chieftain\" in December, 1894.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM BRADBURY'S INITIALS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: F. M. EVANS' INITIALS. (Unfinished)]\r\n\r\nIn the \"Bedford Hotel\"--beloved of Thackeray, for in it he wrote much of\r\n\"Henry Esmond,\" and stayed there when his house was in the painters'\r\nhands--the room occupied was that known as the \"Dryden.\" Here the Staff\r\nwould make no attempt at self-repression; and I have been told how the\r\nidle and the curious would congregate outside upon the pavement and\r\nlisten to the voices of the wits within, and wait to gape at them as\r\nthey passed in and out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY SILVER'S INITIALS.]\r\n\r\nThe places at Table once occupied by the members of the Staff are\r\nnowadays regarded as theirs by right. But in earlier days the places\r\nwere often shuffled, as at a game of \"general post.\" Proof of it may be\r\nhad from the following plans of the Table between 1855 and 1865--perhaps\r\nthe most interesting years in the history of _Punch_, as demonstrating\r\nthe transitional stage, when the ancient order of things was rapidly\r\ndeveloping into the modern as we know them to-day. In 1855, then, the\r\ndisposition was as follows:--\r\n\r\n          WILLIAM BRADBURY*\r\n  DOUGLAS JERROLD      JOHN LEECH\r\n  TOM TAYLOR           W. M.

EVANS*\r\n\r\n--only two artists and a half (Thackeray being a commixture of writer\r\nand draughtsman) to seven writers and a half!\r\n\r\nFive years later--in 1860--the places had changed, partly through death,\r\npartly through rearrangement:--\r\n\r\n                  WILLIAM BRADBURY*\r\n  W.

These were: Mr.\r\nHenry Silver, In August, 1857; Charles Keene, February, 1860 (after a\r\nnine years' probationership); Mr. F. C. Burnand, June, 1863; Mr. G. Du\r\nMaurier, November, 1864; Charles H. Bennett, February, 1865 (though\r\nill-health prevented him from taking his place until the following\r\nJune); and Mr. R. F. Sketchley (till 1894 of the South Kensington\r\nMuseum), January, 1868. The present Staff, I may add, since Mr. du\r\nMaurier's accession, have taken their places at the Table in the\r\nfollowing order: Mr. Linley Sambourne, Mr. Arthur à Beckett, Mr. E. J.\r\nMilliken, Gilbert à Beckett, Mr. Reginald Shirley Brooks (until 1884),\r\nMr. Henry Lucy, Mr. F. Anstey, Mr. R. C. Lehmann, Mr. E. T. Reed, Mr.\r\nBernard Partridge, and in February, 1895, Mr. Phil May. As Mr. Punch\r\napproached man's estate, and arrived at years of artistic discretion, he\r\ncultivated a pretty taste in epicurism; until to-day, if report be true,\r\nthe Dinners (prepared and sent in by Spiers and Pond), the Ayala, and\r\nthe cigars, are all worthy of the palates of the men whose wit it is\r\ntheirs to stimulate and nourish. To summon the Staff to these feasts of\r\nreason it was in later years the practice to issue printed notices,\r\nwhich after 1870 were superseded by invitation cards drawn by Mr. du\r\nMaurier--the design representing Mr. Punch ringing his bell, while the\r\nfaithful fly hurriedly to respond to the behest. But owing to the number\r\nof portraits it contained of old friends now departed, and the painful\r\nrecollections it consequently aroused, its later use has been\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: F. C. BURNAND'S INITIALS.\r\n\r\n_(1) On joining the Table, and (2) on appointment as Editor._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE DU MAURIER'S MONOGRAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LINLEY SAMBOURNE'S MONOGRAM.]\r\n\r\nBut when our Democritus boasted fewer years, there was not so much\r\nceremony in his banquet, neither was there so much state; nor was the\r\nfriendship less keen or the intimacy less enjoyable in Leigh's humbler\r\ndays of \"off-n-off.\" A wonderful company--a brilliant company; with\r\nflashing wit and dazzling sallies, with many \"a skirmish of wit between\r\nthem.\" From more, the quieter flow of genial humour. And among the rest,\r\nthe listeners; men--some of them--who prefer to attend than to talk,\r\neven to the point of reserve and almost of taciturnity. Such men were\r\nJohn Leech, Richard Doyle, and Charles Keene--whose silence, however,\r\nmasked subtle minds that were teeming with droll ideas, and as\r\nappreciative of humour as the sprightliest. What jokes have been made,\r\nwhat stories told that never have found their way into print! What\r\nchaff, what squibs, what caricatures--which it surpasses the wit of a\r\nHalsbury or a MacNeill to imagine or condone!\r\n\r\nOf what the _Punch_ Dinner was at the time when Thackeray was still of\r\nthe band, an idea may be formed from the following extract from Mr.\r\nSilver's Diary, with which I have been favoured by the writer, who for\r\nseveral years sat at it by right. He calls it--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"A NIGHT AT THE ROUND TABLE.\"\r\n\r\n    SCENE: _Mr. Punch's Banquet Hall at No. 11, Bouverie Street._\r\n\r\n    TIME: _Wednesday, March 2nd_, 1859, _six o'clock p.m._\r\n\r\n    F. M. EVANS W. M. THACKERAY JOHN LEECH HORACE MAYHEW TOM TAYLOR\r\n    SHIRLEY BROOKS HENRY SILVER PERCIVAL LEIGH JOHN TENNIEL MARK LEMON\r\n\r\n    'Turbot and haunch of venison--what a good dinner!' says Tenniel,\r\n    reading _menu_. Tantalising to Tom Taylor, who has to dine\r\n    elsewhere; and Thackeray leaves early, to go to an 'episcopal\r\n    tea-fight,' as he tells us--a jump 'from lively to severe,' to\r\n    Fulham Palace from the _Punch_ Table.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 40, Bouverie Street, E.C. July 15th 1871\r\n\r\n    The pleasure of your company is requested on Wednesday next, the\r\n    10th just at half-past Six sharp.\r\n\r\n    An answer, if unable to come, will oblige.\r\n\r\n    _PUNCH_ DINNER INVITATION CARD.

DU MAURIER, JOHN TENNIEL]\r\n\r\nTom merely looks in 'to hear what you fellows say about the Reform\r\nBill,' which Dizzy introduced on Monday. So we begin discussing politics\r\neven with the venison. 'Ponny' Mayhew condemns the Bill: does nothing\r\nfor the working man, he says. Tom thinks that people look to _Punch_ for\r\nguidance, and that we ought to be plain-speaking, and take a decided\r\ncourse. 'Professor' Leigh and Mark agree in thinking that we rather\r\nshould stand by awhile, and see how the stream runs. All seem of opinion\r\nthat Walpole acted as a man of honour in resigning, not being rich\r\nenough to make money of no matter to him.\r\n\r\n'Seria mista jocis' being Mr. Punch's motto (though it never has been\r\nsanctioned by the Heralds' College), Shirley, apropos of money, asks,\r\n'Why is Lord Overstone like copper?' 'Because he is a Lloyd with tin.'\r\nWhereat Thackeray laughs heartily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARTHUR À BECKETT'S INITIALS.]\r\n\r\nOdd that there should now be three old Carthusians in Mr. Punch's\r\nCouncil of Ten. Thackeray observes this to the other two of them [J. L.\r\nand H. S.], and proceeds to say, 'I went to Charterhouse the other day.\r\nHadn't seen School come out since I left. Saw a touching scene there--a\r\nlittle fellow with his hands held tenderly behind him, and a tear or two\r\nstill trickling down his rosy cheek, and two little cronies with their\r\narms around his neck; and I well knew what had happened, and how they'd\r\ntake him away _privily_, and make him show his cuts!'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E. J. MILLIKEN'S INITIALS.]\r\n\r\n'Talking of cuts, Mark, how about the Large one?' Thackeray suggests\r\nLawyer, Doctor, and Schoolmaster, standing in a row as prize boys, and\r\nDizzy presenting them with votes. I propose Diz trying to launch a\r\nlop-sided 'Reform' ship, with the title 'Will it Swim?' Mark suggests D.\r\njoining hands of artisan and yeoman, giving each of them a vote.\r\nThackeray thinks of workman coming among gentlemen of Parliament and\r\nasking, 'What have you done for _me_?' Professor Leigh considers\r\nsituation might be shown by Bright and Dizzy poking up the British Lion,\r\nfor clearly he wants rousing. 'Yes,' says Shirley, 'and when he's\r\nroused, you know, we can have another picture of him with his tail and\r\nmonkey up.' Idea gradually takes shape, and is approved,[8] though\r\nTenniel hardly likes it, and Leech wants to know if Ponny (Mayhew) would\r\nnot prefer a good old-fashioned tragic cartoon of the virtuous and\r\nstarving British Workman, with ragged wife and children, and Death a\r\nghastly apparition in the background.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a little spar between Ponny and 'Pater' Evans. Ponny lets\r\nfly with great vigour: '_Punch_ is standing still now; used to take the\r\nlead, but no longer dares to do so. _Avançons!_' waving hand excitedly.\r\nPater calmly answers that the times are altered, and that _Punch_ is\r\ngoing with them. Strong words have done their work, and there's no\r\nlonger need of them. Nobody now talks about the trampled working man,\r\nnor goes trumpeting abroad the dignity of labour. Then Ponny shifts his\r\nground, and complains that many clever fellows who are workers with the\r\npen are now hardly earning more than many workers with the pickaxe.\r\n'Well, it's their own fault,' says Pater; 'they might easily earn more\r\nif they were not so idle.' Penny replies they don't want luxuries, being\r\nmen of simple tastes, and anything but Sybarites. 'So am I,' cries\r\nLeech; 'my tastes are very simple. Give me a good day's hunting, and\r\nsome good claret after it--nothing can be simpler, and I'm really quite\r\ncontented.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GILBERT À BECKETT'S INITIALS.]\r\n\r\nBut Ponny harks back to his 'deuced clever fellows,' applauding one of\r\nthem especially, a Bohemian friend of his, who, he says politely, is far\r\ncleverer a fellow than any at the _Punch_ Table. 'But what has he done?'\r\nasks Leech. 'Tell you what he doesn't do,' says Shirley; 'he may write a\r\nlot, but he certainly doesn't wash much.' Somebody wonders, if he were\r\nproposed for White's Club, whether members would blackball him: and\r\nShirley quotes Charles Lamb's remark, 'What splendid hands he'd hold, if\r\nonly dirt were trumps!' Then Ponny shouts indignantly, 'There, never\r\nmind his hands: think what a clever head he has.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARRY FURNISS'S INITIALS.]\r\n\r\nHere Professor gives a little lecture on phrenology, impelled thereto by\r\nPenny's capital allusion. Talking like a book, as his frequent manner\r\nis, he expounds in fluent phrase his deeply-rooted faith in this\r\nneglected science. To give idea of its importance, he vows he wouldn't\r\nkeep a housemaid who had a bad head. 'No more would I,' says Shirley;\r\n'I'd send her to the doctor.' 'I mean, a head ill-shapen,' explains\r\nProfessor blandly, being 'the mildest-mannered man that ever cut a\r\nthroat'--in argument. 'A well-proportioned head betokens a fine brain:\r\nwhereas a skull that is cramped contains probably a mean one.' Avows\r\nbelief not so much in the localisation of organs as in their general\r\ndevelopment. Here Leech, who hates street music, professes horror at the\r\npossible development of organs, and wishes they were localised where\r\nnobody could hear them. Paying no heed to this flippancy, Professor\r\nexplains gravely that peculiar formations incline to special acts, and\r\nthat the development of certain cranial organs--vulgarly termed\r\n'bumps'--may be lessened or augmented in the course of early schooling.\r\n'Well, I do believe in \"bumps,\"' says Shirley, speaking with solemnity,\r\n'yes, even in schoolboys' heads--if you knock them well together.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H. W. LUCY'S INITIALS.]\r\n\r\nMark next has an innings, and tells some of his stage stories. He tells\r\nthem very funnily, and imitates Macready and many other actors in their\r\nvocal mannerisms. And he mimics operatic singers capitally, with\r\nsonorous words in mock Italian basso recitative. Among his tales is one\r\nof a half-tipsy actor playing in the 'Corsican Brothers' and explaining\r\ntheir fraternal peculiarity--'My brother in Paris is now\r\nfeeling--hic--precishly shame senshations--hic--as myshelf!' Also tells\r\nof his once bringing out a farce called 'Punch' at the Strand Theatre,\r\nwherein a parrot played a prominent part. One night a new parrot took\r\nits place, and used most dreadful language when the curtain rose.\r\n\r\nStory-telling being now the order of the evening, Silver tells of the\r\ngun trick being tried in the Far West. One day, just as the conjuror had\r\ncaught the bullet in his teeth, another whizzed close to his head, and a\r\nvoice came from the gallery, 'Guess, I nearly had you then, old hoss!'\r\nAt the next performance a placard was displayed, and gentlemen were\r\nbegged to leave their rifles with the doorkeeper. Shirley enjoys this,\r\nand says, 'Now, don't cry \"_connu_\" Ponny! You're always crying\r\n\"_connu_\" when anyone says anything. And you're always cracking up your\r\nchums. If a world was wanted anywhere, you'd say your brother had\r\ndiscovered one and had better be consulted.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANSTEY GUTHRIE'S INITIALS.]\r\n\r\nPonny then breaks out again with his bilingual vehemence and Parisian\r\ngestures. (Some people never can talk French without trying to shrug\r\nshoulders.) Brandishing his dessert-knife, he shouts, 'Avançons, mes\r\namis! go ahead, my boys! En avant! Excusez-moi,' and scatters scraps of\r\nFrench about, till Leech cries, 'There, don't talk like a lady's-maid,\r\nPonny; why can't you speak English?' And, to change the talk, he tells\r\nof a French sport'man taking his first fences here, with rather a fresh\r\nhorse which has been lent him. After coming a couple of bad 'croppers,'\r\nwhich he conceives to be the usual style of leaping here in England, he\r\nsays a little sadly, 'My friend, I t'ank you for your 'orse, bot I t'ink\r\ndat I s'all jomp no more at present.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E. T. REED'S INITIALS.]\r\n\r\nSomebody caps this with tale of a 'Mossoo' who manifests deep sorrow at\r\nthe death of an old hare, slain by an English visitor. 'Hélas! il est\r\nmort enfin! Mon pauvre vieux! I have shot at him for years! He was all\r\nthe game I had!'\r\n\r\nAnd Leech tells another story of a foreigner of distinction hunting in\r\nthe Midlands, and hearing the cry 'Stole away!' and shouting out\r\nexcitedly, 'Aha, stole a vay, has he, de old t'ief! Den I suppose we\r\ns'all not find a vay to him, and so we must go home!' ... Which we do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R. C. LEHMANN'S INITIALS.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus, for half a century has Wednesday evening been passed in the\r\neditorial office of _Punch_, just when its readers are discussing the\r\nmerits of the previous week's issue; and according to the verdict of\r\nthose readers was attuned the merriment of the Staff. It is on record\r\nhow Douglas Jerrold would go radiant to the Dinners as \"Mrs. Caudle\" was\r\nsending up _Punch's_ circulation at a rapid rate; \"and was one of the\r\nhappiest among them all.\" Thackeray, too, first tasted the delights of\r\nwide popularity in the success of his \"Snob Papers,\" and he showed the\r\npleasure he felt in his demeanour at the board. At one time these two\r\nmen sat side by side, and there was as little love as space between\r\nthem; but with the good-humoured philosophy which is a tradition of that\r\ninstitution, the occasional differences of opinion, and the harder\r\nknocks of wit, and sometimes, even, the still sharper encounters of\r\ntemper, were all glossed over. As Thackeray so truly remarked\r\nhimself--\"What is the use of quarrelling with a man if you have to meet\r\nhim every Wednesday at dinner?\" Nevertheless, in course of time he\r\nchanged his seat from between Jerrold and Gilbert Abbott à Beckett, and,\r\ncrossing over, faced his friend the enemy, while Mark Lemon, watchful\r\nand alert beneath the cloak of geniality, was quick to cast a damping\r\nword on inflammable conversation and--so far as he could persuade them\r\nto listen to a man so greatly their inferior in genius and intellect--to\r\nstem the threatened outburst. As a matter of fact, Jerrold always\r\nregarded Thackeray as a bit of a snob and viewed his entrance into\r\nSociety--against which Jerrold had for years been hurling his bitterest\r\ndarts--with very grave suspicion. \"I have known Thackeray,\" he would\r\nsay, \"for eighteen years, and I don't know him yet\"--almost in the\r\ndespairing words in which I have heard a distinguished Academician speak\r\nof his still more distinguished President. On the other hand, Mr. Arthur\r\nà Beckett has declared to me, \"I never knew my brother so well as when I\r\nmet him at the _Punch_ Table.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. BERNARD PARTRIDGE'S INITIALS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHIL MAY'S INITIALS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMENCEMENT OF C. H. BENNETT'S MONOGRAM.]\r\n\r\nIn the earliest weeks of _Punch's_ existence Kenny Meadows had been the\r\nNestor of the least; but when Jerrold joined the Staff three months\r\nlater, he took by force of character and wit, and power of lung, a\r\nleading position on the paper and at the Table--a position which he\r\nnever resigned. Notwithstanding his biting sallies, we may be sure that\r\nit was not Jerrold's primary object to make his victims wince. There is\r\nno doubt that the \"little wine\" that so stimulated him to witty and\r\nbrilliant conversation full of flash and repartee, sometimes turned sour\r\nupon his lips, and changed the kindness that was in his heart into a\r\nsemblance of gall. Mr. Sidney Cooper has gravely set it on record how on\r\nleaving the _Punch_ Dinner Jerrold would tie a label with his name and\r\naddress upon it round his neck, so that, should he in his homeward\r\ncourse be tempted to stray into the path of undue conviviality, he might\r\nsooner or later be safely delivered at his destination. Although the\r\nstatement is in a measure confirmed in the memoirs of Hodder and of\r\nBlanchard Jerrold himself, one cannot help being struck at the conflict\r\nbetween it and the story of Jerrold's reply to the drunken young sparks\r\nwho met him in the street at midnight, and asked him the way to the\r\nentertainment known as \"Judge and Jury\"--\"Straight on, straight on as\r\nyou are going, young gentlemen--you can't miss them!\" He was himself\r\ngreatly pleased with his milder witticisms, and, it is said, chuckled\r\ncomplacently at the neatness of his conceit when toasting Mr. Punch, at\r\none of the Wednesday Dinners, in which he declared that \"he would never\r\nrequire spirit while he had such good Lemon-aid.\" He loved the paper as\r\nfew others loved it, and very, very rarely missed the weekly\r\ngathering--attending it, indeed, up to within a week or so of his death.\r\n\r\nNot less scrupulous in his attendance was Gilbert Abbott à Beckett, who,\r\nwhen residing at holiday-times at Boulogne, would regularly come up to\r\ntown for their Cabinet Council; and if ill-chance unavoidably prevented\r\nhis wished-for presence, he would write--after the custom adopted by\r\nmany of his colleagues--a full explanation and apology. But the\r\nnecessity very seldom arose. True son of his father, Gilbert à Beckett\r\nwas equally faithful to the Table, and in spite of the paralysis of the\r\nlegs from which he suffered (and for which he was for a time duly\r\nchaffed by the advice of Percival Leigh, lest there might be hysteria\r\nabout the disease) he attended the Wednesday gatherings with what\r\nregularity he could up to within a fortnight before he died. Thackeray,\r\ntoo, for many years after he ceased writing for _Punch_ would weekly\r\njoin the Staff, and always received a cordial and affectionate welcome.\r\nThe gentle Leech--who, according to Shirley Brooks, attended the Dinner\r\nfor more than twenty years without uttering an unkind or an angry\r\nword--was at the Table within a few days of his death, but, in Brooks's\r\nwords, \"scarcely seemed to understand what was going on.\" And yet\r\nanother member of the Old Guard, who stood by his post to the end, was\r\n\"The Professor,\" Percival Leigh, whose sense of wit was dulled with age,\r\nbut whose mind was otherwise as bright as ever. But at the Dinners the\r\ngenial, courteous old gentleman was listened to, as ever, with deference\r\nby his younger collaborators, and from them he never had cause for\r\nsuspicion that his powers were failing--\r\n\r\n  \"Full well they laughed, with counterfeited glee,\r\n  At all his jokes, for many a joke had he.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of _Punch's_ favourite sons was Charles H. Bennett. His life was\r\na hard yet happy one, and his career was short, though not too short for\r\nfame; and the last two years during which he sat at the Table were\r\nperhaps the merriest of them all. But his attendances, really owing to\r\nthe illness which ultimately bore him down, were irregular. This\r\nirregularity, combined with his habit--then commoner even than now among\r\nartists--of wearing his hair very long, brought him one day a letter\r\nfrom his friends and fellow-diners in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n  \"Punch\" Council, October 24th, 1866.\r\n\r\n  Present:--LEMON               W.

Keene was what Tories call a patriot and Liberals a\r\n\"Jingo;\" and in his quiet way he felt so deeply that he thought it best\r\nto stay away--not that he loved _Punch_ less, but he loved his\r\nconvictions more. \"I am sorry to say,\" he wrote, with doubtful accuracy,\r\n\"_Punch_ is 'Musco' to a man except C. K., so he keeps away from that\r\nLiberal lot at the present conjunction.\" There certainly was, however,\r\nanother reason, quite independent of politics, which kept Keene from the\r\nTable during the latter years of Mr. W. H. Bradbury's life. He was not,\r\nas his biographer, Mr. Layard, has pointed out, of much use in\r\nsuggestion at the business function of the Dinner, and he looked less to\r\nhis colleagues than to his friends outside for the jokes to which he\r\ndrew his pictures; so that his presence was not a necessity.\r\nNevertheless, he would attend, now and again, until age began to tell\r\nupon him; and his companions love to think of him, clutching his\r\nshort-stemmed pipe to his mouth, puffing gravely, saying little,\r\nthinking much, quick at appreciating a joke, slow at making one, with an\r\neye full of humour, and its lid and corresponding corner of his mouth\r\nquickly responsive to any quip or crank that might let fly. Eclectic in\r\nhis humour as in his art, disposed to condemn any cartoon suggestion not\r\nthoroughly thought out as \"damn bad,\" he was in the weekly assembly at\r\nthe Table like the 'cello in the orchestra--not much heard, yet when\r\nthere indispensable to the general effect and the general completeness,\r\neven though he only went \"for company.\"\r\n\r\nI have lingered, perhaps unduly, over the social side of the _Punch_\r\nDinner, for the company is of the best, and the subject an entertaining\r\nand a pleasant one. But serious business has to be discussed and\r\ntransacted--and transacted it is, whatever jokes and ebullitions of\r\n_bonhomie_ may form the running accompaniment to the work in hand. In\r\nMark Lemon's time the Dinner began at \"six sharp,\" and in Shirley\r\nBrooks's and Tom Taylor's a half-hour later; but when Mr. F. C. Burnand\r\ntook up the reins of power, the hour was advanced to seven o'clock, and\r\non its stroke the Staff are generally found in their places. From all\r\nparts they come, just as their predecessors used to speed from Boulogne,\r\nfrom Herne Hill, and from the Isle of Wight, so that their absence\r\nshould not be felt nor their assistance lacking at the Gathering of the\r\nClan. Sir John Tenniel comes from Maida Vale, most likely, or from some\r\nspot near to London--which he has hardly quitted for a fortnight\r\ntogether during the last forty years, save when, in 1878, he went to\r\nVenice with Mr. Henry Silver and left Charles Keene _malgré lui_ as\r\ncartoonist-in-chief. Mr. Sambourne arrives, perhaps, from a yachting\r\nexpedition or from the moors; Mr. du Maurier from his beloved Whitby or\r\nfrom a lecturing tour; Mr. Lucy hurries in from the House of Commons;\r\nMr. Furniss, up to the time of his resignation, from some distant spot\r\nwhere he \"entertained\" last evening, and whence he would expect to be\r\nthree hundred miles away on a similar errand on the morrow. But not for\r\nsome time past, it must be said in passing, had either Mr. du Maurier or\r\nMr. Furniss been so regular at the Table as in earlier days--Mr. Furniss\r\nby reason of his touring, and Mr. du Maurier on account of the distance\r\nof his home, and the evil effect of tobacco-smoke on his eyes and\r\nnerves.\r\n\r\nThen when dinner is over and coffee finished, and paper and pens brought\r\nin--at half-past eight, as near as may be--the cigars come on and the\r\nwaiters go off (including at one time the crusted Burnap, an original\r\nworthy of \"Robert\" himself); and not more rigidly was the Press excluded\r\nfrom the Ministerial Whitebait Dinner in the good old times, than are\r\nCabinet Ministers interdicted from the Dinner of Mr. Punch to-day. Then\r\nthe Editor, who has been presiding, invites ideas and discussion on the\r\nsubject of the \"big cut,\" as the cartoon is commonly called; and no two\r\nmen listen more eagerly to the replies--suggestions that may be\r\nhazarded, or proposals dogmatically slapped down--than Mr. Burnand, who\r\nis responsible for the subject, and Sir John Tenniel, whose duty it will\r\nbe to realise the conception. The latter makes few remarks; he waits,\r\nreflects, and weighs, thinking not so much, perhaps, of the political or\r\nsocial, as of the artistic possibilities of the subjects as they are\r\nbrought up, and other points that recommend themselves both to the\r\nartistic and literary members of the Staff. All the while, perhaps, the\r\nEditor has a fine subject up his sleeve, and only brings it forth when\r\nthe discussion has begun to wane. Or a proposal may be made at the very\r\nfirst by one member of the Staff that is accepted at once with\r\nacclamation--an event, however, of the utmost rarity; or again, as is\r\nusually the case, the final decision may be gradually and almost\r\npainfully evolved from this symposium of professional wits and literary\r\npoliticians. This is the time when the men are apt to lay bare their\r\npolitical beliefs (if any such they have) or their lack of them; and I\r\nwager that if poor Keene could once more be present at a _Punch_ Dinner,\r\nhe would no longer charge it against the Staff that it is \"'Musco' to a\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, at the present time _Punch_ may be considered to represent the\r\nold Whig feeling. Sir John Tenniel, Mr. Anstey, and Mr. Arthur à Beckett\r\nare credited with Tory bias; Mr. Milliken, Mr. H. W. Lucy, Mr. R. C.\r\nLehmann, and Mr. Reed represent the Radicals; Mr. Sambourne is Unionist;\r\nand Mr. Burnand, as behoves him who holds the scales, confesses to no\r\npolitical sympathies or antipathies whatever.\r\n\r\nThus the subject of the cartoon is settled--often by the aid of the\r\nlatest editions of the evening papers; and being once settled, is very\r\nrarely revived on any pretext whatever. On one occasion, however, when\r\nMark Lemon was Editor, and Shirley Brooks was recognised as the best\r\nsuggestor, an exceptional incident took place. The subject was duly\r\ndecided upon, and Brooks went home. After he was gone, and none but Mark\r\nLemon, Charles Keene, Sir John Tenniel, and Mr. Henry Silver were left,\r\nKeene, to the surprise of the rest, made a suggestion in connection with\r\nthe American War then being waged, that was immediately accepted as\r\nvastly superior to that which had previously been adopted; and the\r\nfuture Editor was much astonished as he opened his paper on the\r\nfollowing Tuesday and his eyes fell on a different and wholly unexpected\r\ncartoon. Yet, though Brooks was practically the Suggestor-in-Chief, it\r\nwould be unfair to pass over the curious fitness of Leech's proposals.\r\nThey were always marked with equal judgment and taste, and, as it was\r\nadmitted, his suggestions invariably were \"just right.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the \"big cut\" has been decided on, the question of a single-page or\r\ndouble-page engraving sometimes comes up; and then the legend has to be\r\nsettled. This (irreverently known as \"cackle\" by those who produce it)\r\nis largely the work of Mr. E. J. Milliken, who nowadays occupies a good\r\ndeal of Shirley Brooks's old position of \"suggestor,\" and who, like him,\r\nis living testimony of the truth of John Seddon's saying that \"wit and\r\nwisdom are born with a man.\" For many years Mr. Milliken has suggested\r\nthe greater number of the cartoons, and he is generally the first asked\r\nfor a proposal for Sir John Tenniel's cut. He usually has several\r\nsubjects, carefully considered and as carefully written out, in his\r\npocket-book, and fitted with peculiarly felicitous quotations. He is\r\nalso mainly responsible for the Almanac cartoons--subjects for both the\r\ngreat _Punch_ satirists--Sir John, and Mr. Linley Sambourne. All,\r\nhowever, share with him the duty and the credit of the difficult art of\r\ncartoon-suggesting, and, no matter by whom it may be proposed, no\r\nsubject is passed without full discussion. Every possible objection is\r\nheard and considered. Although Mr. Milliken may bring in his Bill,\r\namendments are always proposed, and are either rejected or carried; and\r\nthen the Bill as amended becomes the subject of the cartoon. The title\r\nand legend are written on a piece of paper, which, enclosed in an\r\nenvelope, is then handed over to the cartoonist. It was at this moment\r\nthat Shirley Brooks used to throw down his knife in order to \"cut\" any\r\nfurther discussion, and after that symbolic act a more desultory\r\nconversation on the other men's work would follow. Not on Leech's,\r\nhowever; for he was left greatly to himself--a piece of masterly\r\ninactivity and non-interference on the Editor's part which speaks\r\nvolumes for Lemon's prudence and shrewd discrimination.\r\n\r\nUnder Mr. Burnand's _régime_ the course of events is a little altered.\r\nFor even while Sir John has begun to think out the composition and the\r\ntechnical details of the subject which the Council has determined, and\r\nis scheming maybe in his own mind how best he may arrange his figures so\r\nthat when he draws them the heads will not come across a join on the\r\nwood-block where its segments are screwed together; or, again, how so to\r\narrange an exceptionally elaborate subject that Mr. Swain may still have\r\nit ready for engraving in good time on the Friday evening, the attention\r\nof the Staff is now turned to the \"Cartoon junior\"--the second\r\ncartoon--to which for some years Mr. Linley Sambourne has been giving\r\nsome of the finest and most ingenious work of his life. This is\r\ndiscussed somewhat like the first, and often enough raises the\r\ndraughtsman's interest in the work he has to do to a point of genuine\r\nartistic enthusiasm. But there appears to be no finality about the\r\nsecond cartoon so far as the Dinner is concerned, and it is no unusual\r\nthing in lively times for the subjects to be given at the last moment by\r\ntelegram to Mr. Sambourne; so that his condition of mind during the\r\nThursday following the Dinner may not inaptly be compared to that of an\r\nanxious fireman waiting for a \"call.\" The contributions of the rest of\r\nthe artistic Staff--Mr. du Maurier, Mr. Bernard Partridge, and Mr. E. T.\r\nReed--do not form the subject of Wednesday's cogitation; nor is it true,\r\nas has publicly been stated, that when jokes fail it is customary to\r\ndraw them from a pot into which, written on slips of paper, they have\r\nbeen deposited on the many occasions when Mr. Punch's cistern of wit has\r\noverflowed into the jar in question.\r\n\r\nSuch is the simple function of \"the _Punch_ Dinner.\" The Editor\r\npresides--or, in his absence to-day, Mr. Arthur à Beckett, just as it\r\nwas Douglas Jerrold and Shirley Brooks in Lemon's time, and Tom Taylor\r\nin Brooks's (the duty of vice- or assistant-editor never falling to an\r\nartist)--inviting suggestions, \"drawing\" his artists, and spurring his\r\nwriters, with rare tact and art; and he challenges comparison with any\r\nof his predecessors, just as Sir Frederic Leighton excels all previous\r\nPresidents of the Royal Academy. Some of those who sit around the Table,\r\nas I have already set forth, have attended for many years; and it is\r\nthey who secure to _Punch_ that quality of tradition and healthy sense\r\nof prestige which strengthen him against every assault, whether of man\r\nor of Time himself. To this traditional sense of ancient glory and\r\npresent vigour Sir John Tenniel has of course contributed more than any\r\nother living man; not Leech, nor Thackeray, nor Jerrold, nor Doyle,\r\nserved _Punch_ more loyally or effectively, and he has secured that the\r\ndignified spirit of the paper has suffered no deterioration. To him it\r\nfalls, also, to see that the subjects of cartoons are not repeated. The\r\ntenderness of the Staff for the honour, good name, and pre-eminence of\r\n_Punch_ is delightful and touching to behold; the sentiment of a great\r\npast animates them all, and kindles in them the hope and ambition for as\r\ngreat and as proud a future.\r\n\r\nThe exclusiveness of _Punch_ notwithstanding, he has not always been as\r\ninhospitable (if that is the word to use of an essentially business\r\nmeeting of a private nature) as some of his friends would have us\r\nsuppose. There are many who claim the distinction of having dined at\r\n_Punch's_ Table, but few who can sustain their pretension. Some,\r\nhowever, there are--a very few, it is true; but more than have been\r\nofficially recognised as _Punch_ diners. Mr. Harry Furniss has publicly\r\ncontended that his aunt, Mrs. Thompson, was one of these. As the lady,\r\nbefore she married Dr. Thompson, is said to have been originally engaged\r\nto Landells, the first _Punch_ engraver, this might well be; for about\r\nthe time of the transfer of the property from him to Bradbury and\r\nEvans--and Landells, it will be remembered, did not give up the whole of\r\nhis share till some time afterwards--the rules and regulations were not\r\nby any means so stringent as they ultimately became. In any case, the\r\nclaims of \"Mr. F.'s Aunt\" have in her time been as strenuously insisted\r\nupon as ever they were at the Finchings'. Then came Charles\r\nDickens--whose presence, I believe, is not contested. Before his quarrel\r\nwith Mark Lemon and Bradbury and Evans, because _Punch_ declined to\r\nprint a justification of himself in connection with his purely domestic\r\ncircumstances, he was the guest of _Punch's_ publishers, who were his\r\nown publishers, and who were also the publishers of the \"Daily\r\nNews\"--upon the preparations for which Dickens, as first editor, was\r\nthen engaged. Moreover, Dickens was an intimate friend of Douglas\r\nJerrold, whose influence on _Punch_ at that time was paramount; so that\r\nthe double circumstance is amply sufficient to account for Dickens's\r\npresence at No. 11, Bouverie Street. Much the same considerations may be\r\nheld to explain Sir Joseph Paxton's frequent attendance. The great\r\ngardener--it was _Punch_ who christened his big exhibition building \"The\r\nCrystal Palace,\" \"What shall be done with the Palace of Crystal?\"--was\r\nthe intimate of Mark Lemon. He had also the most cordial relations with\r\nthe Staff, some of whom he would entertain in the gardens of Chatsworth,\r\nwhere he acted as the agent of the Duke of Devonshire, grandfather of\r\nthe present duke, and himself on the best of personal terms with Mr.\r\nPunch. And I have proof that he exerted all his influence in favour of\r\nBradbury and Evans's great new venture, through the intermediary of\r\nCharles Dickens. \"Paxton,\" writes Dickens in one of his letters bearing\r\nupon the subject that lie before me, dated October, 1845--a few months\r\nbefore the launching of the \"Daily News\"--\"has the command of every\r\nrailway and railway influence in England and abroad, except the Great\r\nWestern; and he is in it heart and purse.\" What more likely, then, that\r\nDickens, at work at Whitefriars, should be invited by his friends, his\r\npublishers, to dine with his friends of the _Punch_ Staff?--though he\r\npossibly did not stay to the Cabinet Council; and what more reasonable\r\nthan for them to value Paxton's considerable influence at the price of a\r\ngraceful privilege, seeing that the \"Daily News\" thought it, in those\r\nearly days, worth while to appoint a \"Railway Editor\" at a salary of\r\n£2,000 a year? Moreover, Paxton was interested with Bradbury and Evans\r\nin \"The Gardeners' Chronicle\" (in whose columns he had first published\r\nthe \"Cottagers' Calendar\"), to say nothing of his \"Flower Garden,\" which\r\nhe and Dr. Lindley edited for them. Sir Joseph Paxton, then, was a\r\nconstant and appreciative attendant at the _Punch_ Table until the year\r\n1865, the date of his death.\r\n\r\nMr. Peter Rackham, too, was another guest--the guest, again, and valued\r\nfriend of the publishers--well understood to have given financial\r\nassistance in respect to the founding of the \"Daily News.\" He was a\r\nhighly esteemed friend of Thackeray and Dickens both, and the novelists\r\nand their publishers would send him presentation copies of their new\r\nworks. The former, by the way, presented him with a copy of his\r\n\"Virginians\" when it appeared, inscribing it to Mr. Rackham in this\r\ncharacteristic manner:--\"In the U. States and in the Queen's dominions\r\nAll people have a right to their opinions And many don't much relish The\r\nVirginians. Peruse my book, dear R., and if you find it A little to your\r\ntaste I hope you'll bind it.\" Mr. Rackham ceased his visits to the Table\r\nin 1859, in which year, I understand, he died. Another visitor, as all\r\nthe world now knows, was Dean Reynolds Hole, who has recorded in his\r\n\"Memories\" his impressions of that famous Dinner of February 15th, 1860.\r\nTo me, also, he has given an idea of the effect wrought upon him by the\r\nfrolic of the meal--an impression certainly not dimmed by time nor faded\r\nin his imagination. He says: \"There was such a clash and glitter of\r\nsharp-edged swords, cutting humour, and pointed wit (to say nothing of\r\nthe knives and forks), the sallies of the combatants were so incessant\r\nand intermixed, the field of battle so enveloped in _smoke_, that there\r\nwas only a kaleidoscopic confusion of brilliant colours in the vision of\r\nthe spectator, when the signal was given to 'cease firing.'\" Who would\r\nnot attend a _Punch_ dinner after that?\r\n\r\nA frequent visitor was Mr. Samuel Lucas--known to his fellow-workers as\r\nplain \"Sam Lucas\"--who was then editing the newly-founded \"Once a Week\"\r\nfor Bradbury and Evans. His attendance, which was constant enough\r\nbetween the years 1860 and 1864, was--like that of his sub-editor, Mr.\r\nWalford--doubtless a great convenience to all concerned, for most of the\r\n_Punch_ artists and writers were also contributors to the more serious\r\nmagazine, and arrangements could obviously be more quickly and\r\neffectively made at a single meeting than by a number of special\r\ninterviews. Sir W. H. (\"Billy\") Russell, too, \"dined on several\r\noccasions at the _Punch_ Table, when Mr. Mark Lemon and Mr. Shirley\r\nBrooks were the Editors of the paper;\" the introduction, it is\r\nunderstood, being at the time when he was correcting the proofs of his\r\nCrimean book, which Bradbury and Evans were printing.\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, Sir John Millais--himself a contributor to _Punch's_\r\npages--was once a Dinner guest. \"I certainly dined once,\" he wrote to me\r\na year or two ago, \"at an hotel in Covent Garden ['Bedford Hotel'] when\r\nMark Lemon was editor of _Punch_, and I have always been under the\r\nimpression it was one of their Dinners. The Staff only were present, and\r\nLemon was in the chair, and I sat beside Leech. There were ten or twelve\r\ndining beside myself, and it was on a Wednesday.\"\r\n\r\nThis point settled, then, as to Dinner guests--among whom, says the\r\nproprietress of the \"Bedford Hotel\" (the niece, by the way, of Mark\r\nLemon), Peter Cunningham should also be included--other visitors there\r\nare to be considered. If _Punch_ does not rigidly obey the Biblical\r\nbehest, and when on duty bent is not wholly \"given to hospitality,\" he\r\nat least has allowed hospitality to sit with gladness when the business\r\nof the evening is done. From time to time outside friends were\r\nintroduced, and, according to one witness, whose testimony I am unable\r\nto confirm, Tom Hood, Barham (\"Tom Ingoldsby\"), and Charles Knight have,\r\nat intervals, been entertained \"after business hours.\" The Staff, at\r\nsuch times, would go into Committee over cigars and drinks and literary\r\ntalk and jokes, and Leech would rumble out in his splendid great bass\r\nvoice Barry Cornwall's \"King Death.\" This was the only song of his which\r\nhis friends remember; and Ponny Mayhew would seek to emulate it with the\r\nmusical setting of Thackeray's \"Mahogany Tree.\" He sang that song in\r\nchorus, all upstanding, that sad Christmas Eve when Thackeray died,\r\namong his friends of the Kensington côterie. He had brought in the fatal\r\nnews to the jovial party, and then, says Mr. Frederick Greenwood, he\r\nproceeded: \"I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll sing the dear old boy's\r\n'Mahogany Tree;' he'd like it.\" \"Accordingly we all stood up, and with\r\nsuch memory of the words as each possessed ... and a catching of the\r\nbreath here and there by about all of us, the song was sung.\"\r\n\r\nThen come the special _Punch_ dinners, official and otherwise. In 1863\r\nthere was the Shakespeare dinner, that was held to arrange the\r\nShakespeare Tercentenary number of _Punch_; and a quarter of a century\r\nlater there was the Paris junketting that resulted in the Paris\r\nExhibition number. Then there was the yearly festival celebrated by Sir\r\nWilliam Agnew, and the \"Almanac Dinner,\" which was usually held about\r\nthe month of September--in olden times, from 1850 to 1885--always at the\r\n\"Bedford,\" but lately discontinued; and there is the Annual Dinner to\r\nthe printers and the rest given by the firm--the first of which, under\r\nthe name of \"wayzgoose,\" took place at the \"Highbury Barn Tavern.\" At\r\nthese entertainments the Staff would sometimes attend and fraternise\r\nwith printers and engravers, and would make a point of congratulating\r\nthose \"wood-cutters\" whose recent work had specially delighted them.\r\n\r\n_Punch_ has always been strong on Jubilees, and his \"boys\" have done\r\ntheir best to maintain them as a sacred tradition. On January 3rd, 1853,\r\nJerrold celebrated his fiftieth birthday with a dinner given to the\r\nwhole of his colleagues. Baily, the sculptor, was one of the \"outside\"\r\nguests on the occasion, and was so charmed with the brilliancy and\r\njollity of the company that he offered, and in due time redeemed his\r\npromise, to execute its hero's bust. That work, one of the finest of the\r\nold Academician's portrait-busts, now, if I mistake not, belongs to the\r\nnation's collection of its great men's portraits. On Wednesday, June\r\n27th, 1866, the memorable picnic and dinner took place at Burnham\r\nBeeches, to celebrate Mr. Punch's fiftieth volume, when the popular\r\nEditor received from his proprietors a purse of a hundred guineas and a\r\ntankard, and from them and the Staff a gold watch and chain of eleven\r\nlinks, with a lock in the form of a book, as recounted in the sketch of\r\nMark Lemon's life.\r\n\r\nThen, again, there was Thackeray's \"Atonement Dinner,\" if I may call it\r\nso, for the slight he had unthinkingly cast upon the Staff. In his now\r\ncelebrated laudatory essay on John Leech in the \"Quarterly Review\" he\r\nhad written: \"There is no blinking the fact that in Mr. Punch's Cabinet\r\nJohn Leech is the right-hand man. Fancy a number of _Punch_ without\r\nLeech's pictures! What would you give for it? The learned gentlemen who\r\nwrite the work must feel that, without him, it were as well left alone.\"\r\nPicture the indignation in the office, imagine how strongly would be\r\nresented this _faux pas_ of Thackeray, in which he allowed his\r\nenthusiasm for one friend to overlook, and that not inoffensively, the\r\nfeelings of the others! The writer was abroad at the bursting of his\r\nlittle bomb, and no one was more distressed than himself at the result\r\nof the explosion or readier to admit the fault. He wrote a handsome\r\nletter of apology to Percival Leigh--he explained how \"of all the slips\r\nof my fatal pen, there's none I regret more than the unlucky half-line\r\nwhich has given pain,\" and declared that it was more than his meaning;\r\nand he begged furthermore that the memory of the lapsus--painful equally\r\nto him and to Leech--might be wiped out in a dinner given by himself to\r\nthe confraternity. And they all came to his house in Kensington Palace\r\nGardens, and Thackeray was duly chaffed and teased--\"and who can doubt,\"\r\nsays Trollope, \"but they were very jolly over the little blunder?\"\r\n\r\nThen there was the Staff dinner at the Crystal Palace to inaugurate the\r\nnew series of \"The Gentleman's Magazine,\" when _Punch_ and _Punch_\r\nhistory were greatly to the fore; and the great dinner at the \"Albion\"\r\nto celebrate Mr. Burnand's accession to the editorial chair--when not\r\nonly the Staff, but for the first time since the early days all\r\n\"outside\" contributors to _Punch_ were invited, when, although the\r\nsubject of the cartoon had previously been settled, a certain amount of\r\nbusiness was gone through, just to show \"how it was done.\" And who that\r\nwas there on that great occasion will forget the speech of Mr.\r\nBlatchford--an artist who was the natural successor to Colonel\r\nHoward--he who signed his drawings with a trident?--or Mr. Sala's\r\nsallies, in the funniest of orations, at the expense of Mr. Sambourne,\r\nwho had expressly not donned evening dress? Still more important than\r\nthis was the Jubilee dinner held on July 19th, 1891, just\r\nfive-and-twenty years after the Burnham Beeches picnic--in honour of Mr.\r\nPunch's hundredth volume. The \"Ship\" at Greenwich was the place of\r\nvenue. With Mr. Burnand in the chair, the members of the Staff seated as\r\nrepresented in Mr. Sambourne's well-known drawing of \"The Mahogany\r\nTree,\" with Mr. W. H. Bradbury and Sir William Agnew at one end of the\r\ntable, with toasts to Mr. Punch himself, to Sir John Tenniel, to Mr.\r\nBurnand, and to the proprietors, the enthusiasm \"first grew warm and\r\nthen grew hot;\" and when a presentation of a silver cigar-box had been\r\nmade to the Editor, it was duly resolved to meet again, the same company\r\nin the same place, fifty years hence!\r\n\r\nThe last state event in the world of _Punch_-politico-rejoicings was the\r\ndinner to Sir John Tenniel on the occasion of his knighthood. Then the\r\nbanquet was held at Hampton Court, and the \"Mitre\" was the scene of the\r\nceremony. All the enthusiasm of the Jubilee revels reappeared in an\r\nintensified form. For not only was it all focussed upon one man, but in\r\nhis case there was a great personal triumph, a national recognition of a\r\ngreat work and of a splendid career, and in the eyes of the world the\r\njustification of that mighty art of black-and-white, which through the\r\nprinting-press is a greater vital force than any other existing form of\r\nart--though despised till now in all official quarters--the art by which\r\n_Punch_ rose to his pinnacle of greatness. And added to all this was the\r\nemotional note that prevailed throughout the harmony of the feast, for\r\nnot even Leech himself had captured more hearts than Tenniel--that Grand\r\nOld Man of _Punch_ for whom not one member of the staff but entertains\r\nan affection of the warmest and the most cordial character, which even\r\nrespectful esteem has had no power in moderating. But one event, and\r\nonly one, could call forth greater enthusiasm and greater emotion, and\r\nthat, I apprehend, is when in six years time _his_ Jubilee on _Punch_,\r\nby the kindness of Fate, comes to be celebrated by his loving and\r\nadmiring colleagues.\r\n\r\nSuch are the chief semi-official dinners that have been held; but the\r\nlist would be swelled were those other occasions included when these\r\nmen--never sated, it would really seem, with each other's company--would\r\ninvite the rest of the Staff, or most of it, to dine at their private\r\nhouses. How many of these entertainments were offered by Leech to the\r\nlight-hearted and frisky band who\r\n\r\n  \"Judicious drank and greatly daring dined\"!\r\n\r\nHow many anecdotes might be told of such _réunions_, as they swooped\r\ndown on Landells or on Lemon at Herne Bay, or, in the rollicking days of\r\nyouthful indiscretion, would adjourn at midnight to serenade the\r\nsnoringly unconscious Hine away in the wilds of Hampstead!\r\n\r\nCertain complimentary dinners offered to the _Punch_ Staff should find a\r\nrecord here, if only on the ground of completeness. The first public\r\nrecognition was the Mansion House dinner which, under the title of\r\n\"Literature and Art,\" included the _Punch_ Staff, together with Charles\r\nDickens, the members of the Royal Academy, and a few newspaper men.\r\nDickens has left it upon record how his feelings were hurt at the\r\ntactless way in which the well-meaning Lord Mayor, Sir James Duke,\r\nBart., M.P., imparted to his guests the pleasure it was to him to meet\r\nwith mere talent after being satiated with blood and rank in the persons\r\nof Royalties, Dukes, and Cabinet Ministers. He made them feel, in\r\nfact--and resent not a little--how hitherto the Mansion House had drawn\r\nits line at them, an error which Sir Stuart Knill in 1893 had the better\r\ntaste to avoid. Somewhat of a similar blunder was made by Lord Carlisle,\r\nwho invited Thackeray, Jerrold, and others of the _Punch_ men to meet\r\none or two of their own set, firmly persuaded that he was about to revel\r\nin brilliant conversation, entirely forgetful of the fact that in all\r\nprobability they were perfectly familiar with the others' stories and\r\nhad their tricks of humour by heart. The result, as might have been\r\nexpected, was an entertainment of conventional dulness. How could you\r\nexpect, at a meal so pretentiously forced, of such affected joviality,\r\nto hear Jerrold ask the butler for \"some of the old, not the elder,\r\nport\"? as he would in the sanctity of their own precincts; or retort on\r\none who declared his liking for calf's-tail, \"Extremes meet!\" or (when\r\nthe dish was calf's-head), \"What egotism!\" and yet again, \"There's\r\nbrotherly love for you!\" Not at my Lord Carlisle's, as in Bouverie\r\nStreet, would you hear Shirley Brooks ask the famous two-edged riddle\r\nwhich Dean Hole reminds us of--\"Why is Lady Palmerston's house like Swan\r\nand Edgar's? Because it's the best house for muzzling Delane\r\n(_mousseline de laine_)\"--Delane being then unjustly suspected of having\r\nbeen \"nobbled\" during his visits to my lady's _salon_, at the expense of\r\nthe \"Times,\" of which he was at that time the editor. Nor would you\r\nenjoy the discomfiture of a disputant of \"Master Douglas\" (as Thackeray\r\nrather testily named him), who, after chaffing the great wit for the\r\nunsteadiness of hand through which he broke a glass--which, he declared,\r\n_he_ never did--received for reply an incredulous stare, and the cutting\r\nenquiry, \"Yet I suppose you look into one every morning?\"\r\n\r\nThe latest outside _Punch_ dinner of importance which history has\r\nthought well to set upon record is that given by Mr. Lucy (\"Toby, M.P.\")\r\nin order to bring together for the first time Mr. Gladstone and the\r\nmembers of that Staff which, as a body, had rendered him such steady and\r\ninvaluable support for nearly half a century. What wonder, then, that\r\nthe meeting was a great success, and that everyone present was on the\r\nbest of all possible terms with his fellow-diners? Yet \"Moonshine,\"\r\ncommenting on the event, declared with malicious good-humour that \"It is\r\nsaid that _Punch_ has been entertaining Mr. Gladstone. We don't believe\r\na word of it, as we can't conceive that _Punch_ ever entertained\r\nanybody!\" The object of this fair hit, the Editor of _Punch_, forthwith\r\nsought out the epigrammatist, in the belief that here was a new humorist\r\nwhose services he might employ. He, however, who might have enlightened\r\nhim, wrongly believing that the motive of the quest was less friendship\r\nthan resentment, declined to give the desired information. But Mr. Punch\r\nappropriately avenged the insult--by subsequently absorbing it as a\r\njoke of his own, illustrated by the hand of Mr. Reginald Cleaver.\r\n\r\nPerhaps to these revels of the merry clan should be added the jovial\r\nmeetings of the Moray Minstrels under the hospitable direction of Mr.\r\nArthur Lewis. And yet a stronger claim on the memory of those who now\r\nbear Mr. Punch's _bâton_ between them are the meetings referred to in\r\nthe letter from the late Sir A. H. Layard, which I received shortly\r\nbefore his death: \"I was intimately acquainted with Tom Taylor, R.\r\nDoyle, and other contributors to _Punch_, and constantly met them at\r\nTaylor's table; but I do not remember to have dined at a '_Punch_ Table'\r\non one of the Wednesday evenings. You may probably be aware that they,\r\nlike myself, were in the habit of spending Sunday with Sir Alexander and\r\nLady Duff Gordon, in their house at Esher, where many articles and jokes\r\nand sketches which appeared in the periodical were discussed.\" These\r\nmeetings, however, must have taken place before the time of the \"Papal\r\nAggression,\" and some little while, consequently, before Sir John\r\nTenniel was enlisted as a recruit.\r\n\r\nWho will say, in the face of all this, that _Punch_ has not learned the\r\nsecret of combining pleasure with business, practising the art with\r\ninfinite satisfaction to himself and with the applause of succeeding\r\ngenerations? \"Where Macgregor sits, _there_ is the head of the table,\"\r\nsaid the Scottish chieftain. Where Mr. Punch sits, say those of a later\r\nday, there is the flow of wit and of laughter--there the fountain of\r\nthat fun which has stamped his journal as representative of what is most\r\ncharacteristic and best in English humour--there the source of the art\r\nwhich has been the greatest school of wood-drawing and cutting, and of\r\ntrue caricature, that this country has ever seen. Good-nature is the\r\nquality rarest and most remarkable in a political and social journal.\r\nHow much of _Punch's_ excellent temper, I wonder, is not to be\r\nattributed to his meat before grace? Whether \"the Dinner\" be the sole\r\ncause, I do not venture to pronounce, though I submit the question for\r\nthe consideration of mankind; but is it not imaginable that high living\r\ngoes for something in the sum of _Punch's_ high thinking? and may it\r\nnot almost be said of him, as Moore sang of Sheridan, that his wit\r\n\r\n  \"... in the combat, as gentle as bright,\r\n  Ne'er carried a heart-stain away on its blade\"?\r\n\r\nFor a short time only the _Punch_ Club flourished. \"Its object,\" writes\r\nLandells, \"was to form a little society amongst ourselves to talk over\r\nand settle upon subjects for the paper of the coming week. It was not\r\nstrictly confined to the _Punch_ writers and artists, for friends and\r\nwell-wishers were admitted, and had here an opportunity of entertaining\r\ntheir ideas in a sociable and agreeable manner. Besides those on the\r\nregular Staff of _Punch_, there were members of the club Mr. Grieve the\r\nscene-painter, Mr. Henry Baylis, Mr. Tully the composer,[9] Mr. Joseph\r\nAllen the artist, and I have seen in addition Mr. Charles Dickens, Mr.\r\nStanfield, Mr. Frank Stone, Mr. Landseer, and other celebrities, in that\r\nlittle snug and comfortable room. Here the inimitable Douglas Jerrold\r\nwas in his glory, showing off his ready sparkling wit, his joyous hearty\r\nlaugh ringing out above them all. Alas! several of this once brilliant\r\ncompany have now passed away, but those who remain will ever remember\r\nthe many happy hours spent in the old _Punch_ Club.\"\r\n\r\nIn his \"canino-classic\" poem already mentioned--entitled \"Sodalitas\r\nPunchica, seu Clubbus Noster\"--Percival Leigh gives some further\r\nparticulars of the membership of the Club--lines which I translate\r\nsomewhat freely, perhaps, yet with all the reverence due to their\r\nacademic beauty:\r\n\r\n  \"The names of some of our greatest men the Poet now indites--\r\n  Old Mark and Henry Mayhew, two of _Punch's_ brightest lights--\r\n  (The first beats Aristotle blue; the second, Sophocles):\r\n  _Then enter_ Douglas Jerrold's self, our greatest wit and tease--\r\n  Who treats his friends like Paddy Whack, his love for them to prove;\r\n  And Tully great, whose talent flows in just as great a groove;\r\n  Then Hodder, of the \"Morning Herald,\" sheds the light he brings,\r\n  And Albert Smith the mighty--and the Poet's self who sings.\r\n      O'er these our ancient Nestor rules, who lived when lived Queen Anne,\r\n      And even knew old Japhet--or 'twas so the story ran.\"\r\n\r\nH. G. Hine, who was afterwards to become the Vice President of the Royal\r\nInstitute of Painters in Water-Colours, was elected a member; but his\r\ntaste lay neither in the direction of Clubs nor in the absorption of\r\nstrong drink. And least of all did he love Bohemia. \"I only dined with\r\nthem once,\" he wrote to me, \"and then at the 'Belle Sauvage.' The dinner\r\nwas given by the proprietors of _Punch_ to the Staff. They found the\r\nClub already in existence, and desired to have some part in it, or, as\r\nwas said at the time, to place their finger in its pie. I believe this\r\nto have been the only Dinner held at the 'Belle Sauvage.' I may mention\r\nin connection with the _Punch_ Club (whose meetings, which were not\r\nDinners generally, were held on Saturdays) that much chaff and practical\r\njoking were indulged in, and that was one reason for my non-attendance.\r\nOn one occasion when Albert Smith wanted his hat and umbrella on leaving\r\nthe Club, the attendant presented him pawn-tickets for the articles. He\r\nwas extremely annoyed, sent the man for a policeman, and gave the whole\r\nClub into custody; and they had to pay the redemption price, besides\r\nlooking very foolish. It was Horace Mayhew told me of this.\" It has been\r\nsaid that this was the last straw on Smith's back, and settled his\r\nwithdrawal from _Punch_. But it is only fair to add that the indignity\r\nof which Albert Smith complained was thoroughly in accordance with the\r\nspirit of the practical joking that went on at the time, while the\r\nreason of the pledging was said to be the forcing of the unwilling,\r\nhyper-economical Smith to \"stand punch round,\" as all the others did\r\nfrom time to time, he taking his full share of the liquor, though he\r\ndeclined to entertain in his turn.\r\n\r\nAlbert Smith, indeed, during the time he was connected with _Punch_ was\r\nusually the butt of the jokers, particularly of Douglas Jerrold, but\r\nrarely did he so completely turn the tables on his tormentors as on this\r\noccasion. Yet he was not averse to chaff, particularly when he applied\r\nit to others. One day, at the Club, Mark Lemon had been remarking that\r\nhe had no peculiarities, at least not more than other men, and certainly\r\nnone that he knew of. \"For example,\" said he, \"many men have some\r\npeculiarity in shaving--some shave with the right hand, others with the\r\nleft, or some with either indifferently.\" \"What do _you_ shave with?\"\r\nasked Albert Smith. \"With my right hand,\" replied the Editor. \"Then\r\nthat's your peculiarity, Uncle Mark,\" said Smith; \"most people shave\r\nwith a razor.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt the fun was often a little rough, and that the members were a\r\nlittle ashamed of it; for when Mark Lemon introduced there Mr. Catling,\r\nthe editor of \"Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper,\" he picturesquely warned his\r\nguest to be prepared for \"an awful set of blackguards.\" On the night in\r\nquestion, however, the fun was flatter, and Kenny Meadows, the Father of\r\nthe Feast, distinctly peppery.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of Mr. R. J. Hamerton's visit Jerrold was in high\r\nfeather, and, waxing eloquent on the growing influence of _Punch_, cried\r\nfor silence while he proclaimed its ingredients. Gilbert à Beckett, he\r\ndeclared, was the spirit, and John Leech the sugar; Albert Smith was the\r\nwater; himself, he confessed, was the acid; and Mark Lemon--the spoon.\r\nAnd among other little witticisms of the Punchites which memory has set\r\non record is a conversation among them on the subject of the payment of\r\nincome-tax. With most of them there was in the earliest days little\r\nincome and less tax, and strange were the stories told. At last one,\r\nwhose name has not been preserved, quietly asserted that he honestly\r\nfilled in the declaration each year, and honourably paid the demand\r\nwhich was regularly served upon him. The company's surprise had\r\nincreased to contemptuous incredulity, when their Quixotic friend\r\nproceeded: \"I don't think I lose by it, I always take the average of\r\nthree years, according to the regulation; so I take the present year\r\nand the two future ones--_and you fellows know what a pessimist I am_!\"\r\n\r\nIt was usually at the \"Whistling Oyster\" that the meetings of the Club\r\nwere held. The little house was conveniently situated, as already\r\nexplained, next door to the \"Crown\"--now Number 12 or 12A Vinegar Yard.\r\nAt this place a Mr. Pearkes had opened an oyster shop nearly twenty\r\nyears before, and his little rooms were frequented by the most talented\r\nof the denizens of Bohemia--literary, theatrical, and artistic. One day,\r\nin the early 'Forties, the proprietor, to his amazement, heard one of\r\nhis oysters whistling--a continuous shrill little whistle, doubtless\r\nthrough a hole in its shell. The fact was at once noised abroad, and\r\ncrowds visited his shop to listen to the sibilant mollusc, which not\r\nonly whistled, but, it was said with some truth, drew the town as\r\neffectively as old Drury herself, on the other side of the court.\r\n\r\nThe rain of jokes that followed was ceaseless, and _Punch's_ not the\r\nworst. He celebrated the bivalve in his pages by picture and by word,\r\nand his young men made the best of the incident. Douglas Jerrold, says\r\nWalter Thornbury, suggested that it was one of the sentimental kind\r\nwhich, having been crossed in love, took to whistling to keep up\r\nappearances and show it didn't care. Thackeray declared in all\r\nseriousness that he had heard an American in the shop, after listening\r\nto the performance, gravely assert that at home in Massachusetts they\r\nhad a much cleverer oyster, which not only whistled \"Yankee Doodle\" from\r\nbeginning to end, but followed his master about like a dog. And it was\r\nfurther suggested that, report having exaggerated the powers of the\r\nperformer into being able to whistle \"God save the Queen,\" the\r\nproprietor had been requested to take it to Windsor Castle, but that the\r\ncommand had been summarily cancelled when it was ascertained _that the\r\nmusician was a \"native!\"_ The result to the fortunate proprietor was a\r\nsubstantial one; his house became known and for many years kept up its\r\nreputation on the deformity of a twopenny shell-fish. It is, therefore,\r\nhardly surprising that \"other vermin\" took to music as well; that about\r\nthe same time a \"singing mouse\" made its appearance, duly touring in\r\nLondon and the provinces; and that _Punch_ made the most of the engaging\r\nlittle _virtuoso_.\r\n\r\nFor some few years, then, the _Punch_ Club flourished. In Hal Baylis it\r\nhad an ideal chairman, roystering, jovial, witty, side-splitting--the\r\nonly man, in the opinion of many, who could draw his sword and maintain\r\nhis ground against Jerrold's cut and thrust. So good were his sayings,\r\nor so adaptable to _Punch's_ purpose, that his position in the Club was\r\nrespected, and he was put upon the free list, and received his weekly\r\ncopy of the paper up to the day of his death. He was originally a\r\nprinter, then a newspaper proprietor and editor; but fate had been\r\nunkind to him, and in the days of his presidency he had come to be an\r\nadvertisement canvasser. He ruled with royal dignity, but knew the limit\r\nto his powers; and when Landells made his appeal to \"the boys\" at one of\r\nthe dinners to \"see him righted\" in connection with his quarrel with\r\nBradbury and Evans, he comforted the ex-engraver as best he could, and\r\nskilfully passed to the \"Order of the day.\"\r\n\r\nOf Baylis's judgment of character and capacity Landells has left the\r\nfollowing example: \"One evening at the _Punch_ Club there had been more\r\nthan the usual amount of chaff going on between Henry Baylis and Douglas\r\nJerrold, when the former suddenly said, 'If you will give me a pen and\r\nink I will make a prophecy that shall be fulfilled within two years. It\r\nshall be sealed up and given to Daddy Longlegs [myself] upon his\r\nundertaking not to open it before the expiration of that time.' The\r\npaper was handed to me, and carefully put by. Time passed, and I had\r\nforgotten the circumstance altogether, when some years afterwards,\r\nlooking over some old pocket-books, I found a sealed letter addressed to\r\n'Daddy Longlegs, Esq.--to be opened two years after date.' On breaking\r\nthe seal I found the following: 'I, Henry Baylis, do hereby prophesy\r\nthat within two years from this date Douglas Jerrold will write\r\nsomething that shall be as popular as anything that Charles Dickens ever\r\nwrote.'\" Within those two years the \"Caudle Lectures\" had been produced\r\nand Baylis's prophecy fulfilled.\r\n\r\nNothing of the old Club now remains--it passed away with the Old Guard\r\nof _Punch's_ youthful days; and just as _Punch_ himself from a mere\r\nstreet-show puppet rose to reigning wit and arch-philosopher, so\r\npractically has his Club-house been lost to Drury Lane and instead lends\r\ndignity to Garrick Street.\r\n\r\nOne other club--essentially also a _Punch_ côterie--remains to be\r\nmentioned: the \"Two Pins Club.\" A riding club in the first instance, it\r\nconsists of not a dozen members, who periodically jogg off to Richmond\r\nor elsewhere to take exercise and lunch together in riding-breeches and\r\ngood-fellowship. Of these the chief members have been Lord Russell of\r\nKillowen (who on his elevation to the Bench as Lord Chief Justice sent\r\nin his resignation, as you may see in Mr. Linley Sambourne's cartoon of\r\nJuly 14th, 1894, by the letters on the scroll Lord Russell holds:\r\n\"P.P.C.--T.P.C.\"), Mr. Burnand, Sir John Tenniel, Mr. Linley Sambourne,\r\nMr. E. T. Reed, Mr. Harry Furniss, Sir Frank Lockwood, the Hon. Mr.\r\nRussell, Sir Arthur Sullivan, Mr. John Hare, Sir Edward Lawson, Mr.\r\nGeorge Alexander, and Mr. C. H. Matthews. But the savour of _Punch_ is\r\nover it all, and though outsiders are of it, it is as much a _Punch_\r\nclub of _Punch_ origin as the one that went before. It has been said\r\nthat there is difference of opinion as to the source of its name, it\r\nbeing supposed that it arose from one of the founders declaring that \"it\r\ndidn't matter two pins what name it bore.\" The simple truth is that it\r\nwas christened after the names of two great riding worthies--at least\r\none worthy, the other unworthy--of English literature: John Gil_pin_ and\r\nDick Tur_pin_; of the latter of whom Thomas Hood tells us that when the\r\nromantic malefactor was righteously hanged, after a spirit-swilling\r\ncareer, he died of having had \"a drop too much.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] The initials and monograms appear in the following order round the\r\nTable: 1, Mark Lemon; 2, F.

Later on, the club and the\r\ndrawing-room frankly recognised the power wielded by the paper, and, by\r\nthat very acknowledgment, influenced it to an obvious degree. Then came\r\nthe sentiment of Church and State, and the Palmerston patriotic pose\r\nthat was most to the taste of the threepenny public; and for a long time\r\nthe plucky, cheery, careless, \"_Civis-Romanus-Sum_,\" \"hang-Reform\"\r\nstatesman was the special pet of _Punch_, and more particularly of\r\nShirley Brooks. When that Editor died, Tom Taylor imparted a decidedly\r\nRadical, anti-Beaconsfield, anti-Imperial turn; but since the _régime_\r\nof Mr. Burnand a lighter and more non-committal attitude has been\r\nadopted and maintained.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, the prevailing _Punch_ tradition with regard to\r\nmatters political--at least, in the belief of its conductors--has been\r\nto hold the balance fairly between the parties, to avoid fixed and\r\nbitter partisanships, to \"hit all round\" as occasion seemed to demand,\r\nand to award praise where it appeared to be deserved. If there was to be\r\na general \"list\" or \"lean,\" it was to be towards a moderate\r\nLiberalism--towards sympathy with the popular cause of freedom both of\r\nact and speech, and enthusiastic championship of the poor and oppressed.\r\n\r\nIf, especially within recent years, _Punch_ has claimed one merit more\r\nthan another, it is to as fair a neutrality as is possible to a\r\nstrong-minded individuality with unmistakable political views.\r\nConservatives have long since protested against what has been called its\r\n\"hideous Gladstonolatry and bourgeois Liberalism,\" and declaimed against\r\nthe occasional partisan spirit of the \"Essence of Parliament.\" \"There is\r\na popular periodical,\" said Mr. Gladstone, in his Edinburgh speech of\r\nSeptember 29th, 1893, \"which, whenever it can, manifests the Liberal\r\nsentiments by which it has been guided from the first. I mean the\r\nperiodical _Punch_.\" Indeed, to that party has always been given the\r\nbenefit of the doubt. But one of the chief organs of Radicalism[10] has\r\ncomplained of an attack on a Liberal Cabinet as \"merely a pictorial\r\ninsult;\" and the professional Home Ruler has denounced with\r\ncharacteristic emphasis the representation by _Punch_ of the Irish\r\nvoter, bound hand and foot, terrorised and intimidated by his priest,\r\nwho exclaims: \"Stop there till you vote as I tell you, or it's neither\r\nmarry nor bury you I will!\" From all of which it may fairly be deduced\r\nthat _Punch_, with occasional lapses of an excusable kind, has, on the\r\nwhole, fairly upheld his character for the neutrality proper to one who\r\nis accepted as the National Satirist, even though--like the Irish\r\njudge--\"he is most just when he lanes a bit on my soide.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Table\" has always shown an amalgam of Conservative and Liberal\r\ninstincts and leanings, though the former have never been those of the\r\n\"predominant partner.\" The constant effort of the Staff is to be fair\r\nand patriotic, and to subordinate their personal views to the general\r\ngood. This is the first aim. For, whatever the public may think, neither\r\nEditor nor Staff is bound by any consideration to any party or any\r\nperson, but hold themselves free to satirise or to approve \"all round.\"\r\nDisraeli they quizzed and caricatured freely; but they always admitted\r\nhis fine traits and brilliant talents. Gladstone they more consistently\r\nglorified for his eloquence, high-mindedness, and skill; but from time\r\nto time they would trounce him roundly for his vacillations or other\r\npolitical shortcomings.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier days of _Punch_ it was more common to make a dead-set at\r\nindividuals--as at Lord Brougham, \"Dizzy,\" Lord Aberdeen, and, during\r\nhis earlier career, John Bright. But many things were done forty years\r\nago which nowadays \"the Table\" would neither tolerate nor excuse--such\r\nas certain attacks upon defenceless royalty (more particularly upon\r\nPrince Albert) as being both unfair and in bad taste. The courteous\r\nhigh-mindedness of Sir John Tenniel has made greatly for this mellowing\r\nand moderation, to the point, indeed, that many complain that _Punch_ no\r\nlonger hits out straight from the shoulder. This peaceable tendency\r\nobviously arises from neither fear nor sycophancy, but from an anxious\r\ndesire to be entirely just and good-natured, and to avoid coarseness or\r\nbreach of taste.\r\n\r\nMuch of the change in _Punch_ has simply been the inevitable\r\naccompaniment of change in the times--in the tastes, manners, social\r\npolish, and sensitive feelings of the courteous and urbane. It is so\r\neasy to be strong in the sense in which an onion is strong; but _Punch_\r\nhas long since cast away that kind of force. Many and many a time an\r\nadmirable \"subject\" for a cartoon has been rejected--pointed,\r\npicturesque, or droll, as the case may be--because some one has raised\r\nthe question, \"But would that be quite fair?\" Jerrold was bitterly\r\ncaustic and sometimes neither just nor merciful in his Quixotic tilting\r\nat upper-class windmills; and Leech, in his earlier work, was often\r\nfiercely drastic. But there was more democratic outspokenness, more\r\nmiddle-class downrightness, and less of the Constitutional Club and\r\ndrawing-room element in those ante-du Maurier days. But men and artists\r\nalter, and become moulded and modified by their environments, and it may\r\nsafely be said that there is to-day no effort on _Punch's_ part to be\r\n\"smart,\" anti-popular, anti-bourgeois, or anti-anything, save\r\nanti-virulent and anti-vulgar.\r\n\r\nIn no department of public affairs has _Punch_ shown greater advance\r\nthan in that of the public Faith. _Punch_ the Religionist--I use the\r\nexpression in all seriousness--while sturdily maintaining his own\r\nground, and as the representative of \"the great Protestant middle-class\"\r\nswiftly denouncing the slightest show of sacerdotalism, has displayed an\r\nincreasing tolerance and liberal-mindedness that were not his most\r\nnotable characteristics in his youthful days. High Church and Low,\r\nbishops and clergy, Protestant and Catholic, from the Pope to Mr.\r\nSpurgeon, have all at times come under his lash.\r\n\r\nMr. Punch has ever kept his eye attentively on the affairs of the\r\nChurch. In his first volume he supported the agitation against the\r\nold-fashioned, high-panelled, curtained pew, at the same time cordially\r\nendorsing the Temperance movement of the young Irish priest, Father\r\nMathew. The cause of the curate he has always upheld with a zeal that\r\nhas betrayed him on more than one occasion into injustice to the\r\nbishops; wherein he has erred in company with his fellow-sage, the Sage\r\nof Coniston. And the cause of the poor man, up to the point of Sunday\r\nopening of museums and picture galleries, has always been an article of\r\nhis religious creed, although in a pulpit reference the Rev. A. G.\r\nGirdlestone declared that _Punch's_ policy was temporarily reversed\r\nduring one editorship in consequence of its being found that the men on\r\nthe mechanical staff of the paper were themselves opposed to the\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nIn _Punch's_ first decade Pope Pius IX. was popular with Englishmen and\r\nwith _Punch_ by reason of his liberalism. But towards the end of 1850\r\nthe cry of \"Papal Aggression\" broke out, and the popular excitement,\r\nalready aroused over Puseyism, was fanned to an extraordinary pitch. The\r\nsituation at that time is described in subsequent chapters dealing with\r\nRichard Doyle and Cartoons; but reference must here be made to the\r\nviolence with which _Punch_ caught the fever--how he published a cartoon\r\n(Sir John Tenniel's first) representing Lord John Russell as David\r\nattacking Dr. Wiseman, the Roman Goliath.[11] In due time, however, the\r\nexcitement passed away. Dr. Wiseman received his Cardinal's hat, Lord\r\nJohn was satisfied with having asserted the Protestant supremacy,\r\nRichard Doyle left the paper, and nobody, except _Punch_, seemed a penny\r\nthe worse, save that the popular suspicion, once aroused, was not for\r\nseveral years entirely allayed. The \"Papal Aggression\" agitation\r\nsmouldered on for a year or two in the paper; but _Punch_ was not too\r\nmuch engrossed to be prevented from giving his support to Mr. Horsman's\r\nBill for enquiry into the revenues of the bishops of the Established\r\nChurch, whom, in one of Leech's cartoons, he represented as carrying off\r\nin their aprons all the valuables on which they could lay their hands.\r\n\r\nThenceforward _Punch's_ religious war was directed chiefly against\r\nPuseyism and its \"toys\"--by which were designated the cross,\r\ncandlesticks, and flowers. The Pope was still with him an object of\r\nridicule, and in one case at least of inexcusably coarse insult; but he\r\nwas by this time (1861) shorn of his temporal power, and had become the\r\n\"Prisoner of the Vatican;\" and his \"liberalism,\" so much applauded in\r\nhis ante-aggressive days, was all forgotten. Nevertheless, some of\r\n_Punch's_ references were harmless and innocent enough, such as that in\r\nwhich he asks, in 1861: \"Why can the Emperor of the French never be\r\nPope?\" and himself replies, \"Because it is impossible that three crowns\r\ncan ever make one Napoleon.\"\r\n\r\nLess fierce, but much more constant, was the ridicule meted out to the\r\nJews. The merry prejudice entertained by John Leech and Gilbert Abbott à\r\nBeckett alike against the Jewish community was to some extent shared not\r\nonly by kindly Thackeray himself, but even by Jerrold, and was\r\nexpressive no doubt of the general feeling of the day. Mark Lemon\r\ncertainly did nothing to temper the flood of merciless derision which\r\n_Punch_ for a while poured upon the whole house of Israel, and some of\r\nBrooks's verses are to this day quoted with keen relish in anti-Semitic\r\ncircles. In his campaign against the sweaters in the early 'Forties a\r\npicture appeared in the Almanac for 1845 in which such an employer was\r\nrepresented by Leech as a Jew of aldermanic proportions, rich and\r\nbloated in appearance and of monstrous ostentation and vulgarity. Yet\r\n_Punch's_ hatred was really only skin-deep, or, at least, was directed\r\nagainst manners rather than against men; and this fact, curiously\r\nenough, gave rise to one of those misunderstandings of which the paper\r\nhas from time to time been the subject. In the spring of 1844 the\r\n\"Morning Post\" was vigorously denounced by _Punch_ for suggesting such a\r\npossibility as a \"gentleman Jew,\" and proposed that the \"accursed dogs\"\r\nhad more than their rights in being spoken of as \"persons of the Hebrew\r\nfaith.\" Thereupon a Jewish reader, considering that _Punch's_ expression\r\nbordered upon rudeness, and that the sufferance which was his tribal\r\nbadge need not under the circumstances seal his lips, wrote to protest\r\nagainst the \"malice and grossness of language\"--for he had failed to\r\nappreciate _Punch's_ robust irony and too carefully veiled championship.\r\nThen, in one of those generous moods which often directed Jerrold's pen,\r\n_Punch_ explained. (Vol. VI., 1844, p. 106.) He pointed out how his\r\narticle had been directed against the \"bygone bigotry and present\r\nuncharitableness\" of the \"Morning Post;\" he quoted Defoe's \"Short Way\r\nwith Dissenters,\" in which the author satirically advocated their social\r\nrights, as an example of how one may be misunderstood by the men they\r\ndesire to serve; he reminded his readers how, when \"Gulliver's Travels\"\r\nwas published, a certain bishop publicly proclaimed that he didn't\r\nbelieve a word of it; and he asked if he--_Punch_--should complain,\r\nthen, when his advocacy of common rights and liberties of the Hebrew is\r\n\"arraigned of malice, prejudice, and jealousy.\" But the Jewish\r\nDisabilities Removal Bill had not at that time been introduced.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1847 that this measure was brought in, and _Punch_ was nearly\r\nas much alarmed as he subsequently was at the \"Papal Aggression.\"\r\n_Punch_ for a time was as strong on the subject as the fanatical Sir\r\nRobert Inglis himself; and Leech's cartoon of Baron de Rothschild\r\ntrying to force his nose--the \"thin end of the wedge,\" he called\r\nit--between the doors of the House of Commons was regarded as a very\r\nfelicitous and brilliant hit. But even then _Punch_ was willing to let\r\nthe other side of the question be heard; and in an ingenious adaptation\r\nof Shylock's soliloquy (p. 247, Vol. XIII., 1847) dedicated to Sir\r\nRobert Inglis--beginning \"Hath not a Jew brains?\" and ending, \"If we\r\nobey your government, shall we have no hand in it? If we are like you in\r\nthe rest, we ought to resemble you in that\"--the whole case of Lord John\r\nRussell and the supporters of the measure was clearly put forth.\r\nSimilarly, when at the very time that _Punch_ was making the most of any\r\nfun that could be got out of his Jewish butt, the \"Strangers' Friend\r\nSociety\" appealed for funds on the ground that the urgency of their\r\ncharitable needs would \"dissolve even the hardest, the most magnetic\r\nastringent Jewish mind,\" _Punch_ vigorously protested against the\r\nquaintness of that virtue and charity which would batten upon the\r\nfaithful by tickling their pet prejudice against the Jews, and declared\r\nthat \"the Society's healing goodness would be none the worse for not\r\nspurting its gall at any portion of the family of men.\" And in more\r\nrecent times _Punch_ has carried his sympathy to its furthermost point\r\nby the powerful cartoons published during the great persecutions of the\r\nJews in Russia, by which--for representing the Tsar, Alexander III., as\r\nthe New Pharaoh--he attained exclusion from the Holy Empire, and from\r\nthe mouthpiece of the Jewish community \"gratitude in unbounded measure\r\nfor this great service in the cause of freedom and humanity.\"\r\n\r\nIn like manner, _Punch_ has displayed equal kindliness of feeling for\r\nthe Irish, though Home Rule never offered strong attraction to his\r\nimagination or statesmanship. From the beginning he always showed a\r\ngenuine sympathy for what he considered genuine Irish sentiment and\r\nsuffering; but agitation, as material for political speculation, seldom\r\nrecommended itself to him. In 1844 (p. 254, Vol. VII.) a cartoon by\r\nLeech was published (originally to have been called \"Two of a Trade\"),\r\nin which the Tsar and Queen Victoria are chatting at a table. On the\r\nwall behind the autocrat hangs a map of Poland; near the Queen, one of\r\nIreland; and she, holding up her forefinger in gentle self-admission of\r\nerror, and in friendly remonstrance with her august visitor, says\r\nsoftly, \"Brother, brother, we're both in the wrong!\" Soon afterwards\r\n_Punch_ became, it was said, \"anti-Irish;\" or, as he himself declared,\r\nhe could not confound Irish misdeeds with Irish wrongs; and it was with\r\nthat view that he was wont to picture the Irish political\r\noutrage-mongering peasant as a cross between a garrotter and a gorilla.\r\nOf course, in their rivalries Daniel O'Connell and Smith O'Brien were\r\nsatirised as the \"Kilkenny Cats;\" but when the \"Great Agitator\" died in\r\n1847, _Punch_ showed how sincere was his sympathy with a people who,\r\nrightly or wrongly, were mourning the death of their leader, and who at\r\nthe time were dying in thousands from the famine that was then black\r\nover the land. Nevertheless, he applauded with delight the thumping\r\nmajority that negatived in Parliament the motion for Repeal of the\r\nUnion. Then came a Coercion Bill, and continued seething discontent; but\r\nthe sad, sweet face of Hibernia then as ever claimed all the beauty that\r\nlay in the cartoonist's pencil. And a year later, when the Queen visited\r\nIreland, and a Special Court of Common Council was held to consider the\r\npropriety of purchasing estates there, _Punch_ showed \"Gog and Magog\r\nhelping Paddy out of the Mess,\" and \"Sir Patrick Raleigh\"--a handsome\r\nIrish peasant of the right sort--laying his mantle across a puddle, and\r\nsmiling as he prays, \"May it please your Majesty to tread on the tail of\r\nmy coat.\"\r\n\r\nSo _Punch_ in his Irish, as in his English, home policy became, and\r\nmaintained the attitude of, an Old Liberal, an elderly member of the\r\nReform Club, with just enough desire for reform to be written down a\r\nRadical by Tories, and enough Conservatism and patriotism to be\r\ndenounced as a Jingo, or its equivalent, by their opponents. But he went\r\nsteadily on; and when Mr. Gladstone became converted to Home Rule,\r\n_Punch_ declined to be committed to the policy. He maintained his\r\nindependence and his Whiggery, in spite of the personal feeling and\r\nfriendship of the chief proprietor of the paper for the aged statesman.\r\nPrivate sentiment was sacrificed to public need, and the position of\r\n_Punch_, and his character for political stability, were thereby further\r\nassured.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the time of _Punch's_ birth the Queen had sat four years upon the\r\nthrone, and had recently entered into happy wedded life, Louis Napoleon\r\nwas living a life in London not at all upon the Imperial plan; Señorita\r\nde Montijo, the future Empress, was a young lady of small expectations\r\nin Spain--the daughter of the Comtesse de Montijo, of the Kirkpatrick\r\nfamily; and the Emperor William, who was destined in the fulness of time\r\nto crush them both, was a political star of at most the fourth\r\nmagnitude. Bismarck, Gladstone, and Disraeli were names already known to\r\nthe public--Mr. Disraeli, indeed, being of those who took part in the\r\ndebate the result of which was to turn out Lord Melbourne's Government\r\n(August, 1841) and send in Sir Robert Peel's, in which Mr. Gladstone\r\ntook his place as Vice-President of the Board of Trade and Master of the\r\nMint. But, like _Punch_, they were but beginning life; Mr. Gladstone was\r\na Tory and High Churchman; Free Trade and the Corn Law Repeal were as\r\nquestions hardly yet \"acute;\" and neither Bright nor Cobden had entered\r\nthe House of Commons. _Punch_, therefore, entered the field at an\r\ninteresting moment, and began by boldly proclaiming his impartiality:\r\n\r\n     \"POLITICS.--'PUNCH' has no party prejudices--he is conservative in\r\n     his opposition to Fantoccini and political puppets, but a\r\n     progressive Whig in his love of _small change_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Disraeli, equally with his rival, changed his party, the fact was\r\nrecorded in a happy parody of Hood's well-known verses:--\r\n\r\n  \"Young Ben he was a nice young man,\r\n    An author by his trade,\r\n  He fell in love with Poly Tics,\r\n    And soon an M.P. made.\r\n  He was a Rad-ical one day,\r\n    He met a Tory crew,\r\n  His Poly Tics he cast away,\r\n    And then turned Tory too.\"\r\n\r\nSoon he was leader of the little \"Young England Party,\" and was to be\r\nseen in _Punch's_ cartoon as a viper gnawing at the \"old file,\" Sir\r\nRobert Peel. Then came the triumph of Free Trade, duly celebrated by\r\nJohn Leech in one of his most light-hearted cartoons.\r\n\r\nThe fatal year of 1848 opened with the memorable letter of the Prince de\r\nJoinville, at that time a young man of thirty, which set half Europe\r\nlooking to their national defences, but which pretended to be aimed only\r\nat an invasion of England. There was, of course, a scare, not to say a\r\npanic, in official circles; but _Punch_ was one of the few who kept\r\ntheir heads, making capital galore out of the situation. He never tired\r\nof deriding the fiery young prince, who was only too glad a little later\r\non to \"invade\" England in the character of refugee. The French army, he\r\ndeclared (by the pen of Percival Leigh), would land, after suffering all\r\nthe tortures of sea-sickness, carefully watched by the Duke of\r\nWellington from a Martello tower. Arrived in London, the invaders would\r\narrest M. Jullien, lay siege to 85, Fleet Street, but raise it forthwith\r\non the appearance of Mr. Punch and Toby, who would follow the fugitives\r\nin hot pursuit. Although _Punch_ ridiculed the matter thus, he yet\r\nproposed the formation of a Volunteer Corps, to be called \"_Punch's_\r\nRifles;\" and it is to be observed that he thus forestalled by four years\r\nthe actual establishment of the Exeter Volunteers. Nevertheless, _Punch_\r\nseriously threatened the movement when it did come with his \"Brook Green\r\nVolunteer;\" yet a few years later, when the idea was revived by the\r\nstarting of Rifle Clubs, with the subsequent notion of transforming them\r\ninto regiments, _Punch_ lent his aid. He would chaff them, of\r\ncourse--for it was his business so to do--but he was proud of them all\r\nthe same, and loudly applauded the spirit that inspired them. The\r\nVolunteers, as he told the French, were \"the boys who minded his shop;\"\r\nand more than one of his Staff enrolled themselves in the patriotic\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nChartism, though in its programme and aspirations respected by _Punch_,\r\nwas despised for its management and mismanagement, and was made the\r\nsubject of much excellent fooling. But the stormy European outlook gave\r\nhim far more concern. In one of his cartoons all the Sovereigns are\r\nshown in their cock-boats, storm-tossed in the Sea of Revolution, the\r\nPope--still in the full enjoyment of his temporal power--being the only\r\none really comfortable and really popular. As the Champion of Liberty\r\nthe Pontiff is at various times portrayed as pressing \"a draught of a\r\nConstitution\" on the kings of Sardinia and Naples and the Duke of\r\nTuscany, dealing a knock-down blow to the \"despotism\" of Austria, and\r\nspitting her eagle on a bayonet; altogether justifying his reputation\r\n(for how short a time to last!) for stability, magnanimity, and love of\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIn this same year of 1848 Prince Louis Napoleon made his second descent\r\nupon France, and _Punch_, mindful of the fiasco of the first, prepared\r\nto give him a warm reception. His treatment from the beginning of the\r\nPretender and Prince-President was that of an unblushing adventurer and\r\ncharlatan. In course of time, as the Emperor became of importance in his\r\nday, he relaxed his severity to some extent, and at times at least\r\nshowed him the respect due to an ally. On other occasions he would\r\nrelapse into his original practice of violent and scornful attack--to\r\nsuch a point, as is seen elsewhere, as to extort the vigorous protests\r\nof Thackeray and Ruskin. \"It is a tradition,\" it is said, \"that when,\r\nduring the _entente cordiale_, the Emperor and Empress paid a visit to\r\nHer Majesty in London, two cartoons were suggested at the _Punch_ Table\r\nto celebrate the event. The first was heroic, representing Britannia\r\nwelcoming the nephew of the great Napoleon to her shores; the second, a\r\n'brushed-up,' refugee-looking individual ringing at the front-door bell\r\nof Buckingham Palace, with the legend 'Who would have thought it?' The\r\nsecond was selected.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince-President as \"The Brummagem Bonaparte out for a Ride\" (the\r\ncartoon which helped to lose Thackeray to _Punch_), galloping a blind\r\nhorse at a precipice, was certainly in the spirit of English popular\r\nfeeling; and even the coronation of the prince made for a time but\r\nlittle difference in _Punch's_ demeanour. But when the Russian\r\ndifficulty came in sight, and \"the Crimean sun rose red,\" Napoleon III.\r\nwas treated with a certain measure of begrudged courtesy; and when the\r\nwar broke out, the tone was even cordial, and the sovereign of our\r\nallies was actually represented as a not altogether undesirable\r\nacquaintance. The close of the war, however, left matters much where\r\nthey were, for the peace, in spite of all rejoicings, was thought to\r\ncome too soon, in order to suit the convenience of the Emperor. Once\r\nmore he was distrusted in his Italian campaign. The sincerity of his\r\nintimate letter to the Comte de Persigny, the French Ambassador to\r\nEngland, was received with little credence, and John Bull replies to its\r\ntenor thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"What _has_ been _may_ recur. Should a Brummagem Cæsar\r\n    Try a dash at John Bull, after conqu'ring the Gauls,\r\n  I intend he shall find the achievement a teaser,\r\n    What with Armstrongs, long Enfields, and stout wooden walls.\"\r\n\r\nThe visit of the Empress Eugénie to the Queen at Windsor Castle, and the\r\nabolition of passports for Englishmen in France (which _Punch_ accepted\r\nas a latch-key, \"to come and go as he liked\"), disposed the paper a\r\nlittle more kindly towards the Emperor; but it was for the\r\nFranco-Prussian War to bring out the full strength and the true\r\nperspicuity of _Punch's_ judgment. There was little fooling here. His\r\nwarning was serious and solemn; he followed every act of the great drama\r\nwith breathless interest and with unsurpassed power of apprehension and\r\npictorial demonstration; and his sympathy for the misfortunes of \"la\r\ngrande nation,\" and his horror at the terrors of the Commune, did not\r\nprevent his pity going forth to the broken leader who had played and\r\nlost, and who returned to England in a plight far sadder and more\r\ndesperate than that in which he had lived his Bohemian life thirty years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIn considering _Punch's_ attitude during his long career, it must be\r\nborne in mind that he has always aimed at representing the sentiments of\r\nthe better part of the country--seeing with London's eyes, and judging\r\nby London standards. _Punch_ is an Englishman of intense patriotism, but\r\nprimarily a Citizen of London, and a far truer incarnation of it--for\r\nall his chaff of aldermen and turtle--than the Lord Mayor and Chairman\r\nof the County Council put together. \"But the aspects under which either\r\nBritish lion, Gallic eagle, or Russian bear have been regarded by our\r\ncontemplative serial,\" says Ruskin, in a passage which to some extent\r\nbears out this contention, \"are unfortunately dependent on the fact that\r\nall his three great designers (Tenniel, Leech, and du Maurier) are, in\r\nthe most narrow sense, London citizens. I have said that every great man\r\nbelongs not only to his own city, but to his own village. The artists of\r\n_Punch_ have no village to belong to; the street-corner is the face of\r\nthe whole earth, and the only two quarters of the heavenly horizon are\r\nthe east and west--End.\" Especially did _Punch_ represent English\r\nfeeling during the great reforms of the 'Forties and 'Fifties. Of course\r\nhe made mistakes, and many of them. \"He who never made a mistake never\r\nmade anything.\" He ground the No-Popery organ; he defended the\r\nEcclesiastical Titles Act; he ridiculed the Jewish Disabilities Bill; he\r\nfostered the idea of relentless vengeance on the Indian mutineers and\r\nrebels, and bitterly opposed Lord Canning's more humane policy;[12] he\r\nissued cartoons during the Secession War--to use the words of Mr. Henry\r\nJames--\"under an evil star;\" he aimed poisoned shafts at Louis Philippe;\r\nhe scoffed, at first, at the Great Exhibition of 1851, and seriously\r\nretarded its progress; he failed to appreciate Lord Aberdeen's\r\nstatesmanship, like the rest of his contemporaries, during the Crimean\r\nWar; he joked at Turner, and sneered at the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood;\r\nhe attacked Bright and Cobden for their attitude during the Chinese\r\nWar; he denounced Carlyle's \"Latter-day Pamphlets\" as mere \"barking and\r\nfroth;\" he ridiculed Joseph Hume with a cruel persistence that called\r\nforth a passionate protest from the \"Westminster Review\" against the\r\nscurrilous attack on one who was \"too good\" for it, for which _Punch_\r\nhandsomely apologised on Hume's death (March 10th, 1855); and generally,\r\nin his own words, \"at this early date Mr. Punch in his exuberance wrote\r\nmuch that he would now hesitate to commit to paper, and for which, if it\r\ndid appear, he would certainly be taken severely to task by a hundred\r\ncorrespondents, of whom a majority would be of the strait-laced order,\r\nand the minority would be largely recruited from North Britain.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEECH'S ORIGINAL SKETCH FOR \"PEEL'S DIRTY BOY.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"PEEL'S DIRTY LITTLE BOY.\"\r\n_Dame Peel:_ \"Drat the boy! He's always in a mess.\"\r\n(_From the Cartoon by Leech in \"Punch,\" Vol. VIII., p. 145. March 29th,\r\n1845._)]\r\n\r\nBut the politician who suffered most from _Punch_--and perhaps the most\r\nundeservedly--was that most unpopular of a long line of unpopular Home\r\nSecretaries, Sir James Graham. He had joined Peel's Cabinet in 1842, on\r\nthe fall of Lord Melbourne's Ministry, and nothing that he did could\r\ncommand the approval of his critics, especially those on _Punch_. His\r\ncapital offence was directing the opening of certain of Mazzini's\r\nletters in consequence of the statements made to our Government by that\r\nof Naples, to the effect that plots were being carried on--of which the\r\nbrilliant and popular Italian refugee was the centre--to excite an\r\ninsurrection in Italy. \"The British Government,\" reported the House of\r\nCommons Committee of Inquiry afterwards appointed, \"issued a warrant to\r\nopen and detain M. Mazzini's letters. Such information deduced from\r\nthese letters as appeared to the British Government calculated to\r\nfrustrate this attempt was communicated to a foreign Power.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon Mr. Duncombe, M.P., upon the complaints of Mazzini, W. J.\r\nLinton (the well-known Chartist, and more distinguished wood-engraver),\r\nand others, that their letters had been secretly opened, charged Sir\r\nJames Graham with the violation of correspondence (June 14th, 1844), and\r\nthough not at first eliciting much information, succeeded in obtaining\r\nthe appointment of a Committee, though a \"secret\" one; and Lord Radnor\r\neffected the same object in the Lords. The result was favourable to the\r\nMinister; but the popular feeling roused by it was intense, and _Punch_,\r\nup in arms at once at this supposed violation of the rights of the\r\nsubject, fanned the excitement he shared. He immediately published, on\r\nJuly 6th, the most offensive attack he could devise. This consisted in\r\nthe famous \"Anti-Graham Envelope\" and \"Wafers\"--the latter _extra\r\nstrongly gummed_.\r\n\r\nThe former was drawn by John Leech--a sort of burlesque of the Mulready\r\nenvelope--and was afterwards appropriately engraved by Mr. W. J. Linton,\r\nwhose share in the agitation was a considerable one. The circulation\r\nattained by this envelope was very wide, and although I have not\r\nascertained that many were actually passed through the General Post\r\nOffice, it certainly brought a flood of bitter ridicule on the\r\nunfortunate Minister. In addition to this, there was published, on the\r\nclever initiation of Henry Mayhew, the sheet of \"Anti-Graham\r\nWafers\"--an instrument of diabolical torture for the unhappy Secretary,\r\nwho already figured as \"Paul Pry\" in half a hundred of the more\r\nimportant papers. In this sheet, 10 inches by 7-3/4 inches in size,\r\ndrawn by H. G. Hine, there were printed sixteen wafers, in green ink, in\r\nthe midst of a witty design, in brown, that bore the devices of a snake\r\nin the grass, a cat-o'-nine-tails, a kettle steaming the fastening of a\r\nletter, and other suggestive personalities. These were supposed to be\r\ncut up and used as wafers on envelopes, and that they were so used is\r\nprobable, in view of their extreme rarity at the present day. They were\r\nissued at twopence the sheet; and their epigrammatic cuts and\r\naccompanying legends were in _Punch's_ best vein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANTI-GRAHAM ENVELOPE.\r\n\r\n(_Designed by John Leech._)]\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ example was promptly followed by that class of publisher who\r\nlives by trading on the ideas of others, and in the windows of many\r\nbooksellers of the commoner class, envelopes in the shape of padlocks\r\nwere offered for sale, the motto on them running \"Not to be Grahamed.\"\r\n_Punch_ itself followed up the scent, and gave drawings of \"Mercury\r\ngiving Sir James Graham an insight into Letters\" (with the aid of a\r\nsteam-kettle), of \"The Post Office Peep-Show, a Penny a Peep,\" in which\r\nforeign sovereigns, on paying their money to Showman Graham, are\r\npermitted to violate the secrecy of British correspondence; while a\r\nnotice from St. Martin's-le-Grand informs his Continental clients that\r\n\"on and after the present month the following alterations will take\r\nplace in the opening of letters:\"--\r\n\r\n  Letters\r\n\r\n       Posted at     Opened at\r\n\r\n        9 A.M.        10 A.M.\r\n       10 A.M.        11 A.M.\r\n       12 A.M.         2 P.M.\r\n        2 P.M.         4 P.M.\r\n        4 P.M.         6 P.M.\r\n\r\nOf course, this was all very unfair and savagely amusing, but much was\r\nforgiven for the cleverness of the hits, and the liberty-loving notions\r\nthat inspired them.\r\n\r\nThe \"railway mania,\" which had been developing during these years, had\r\nfrom the first been viewed with alarm by _Punch_, who, with his\r\ncustomary level-headedness, foresaw the crash and the reaction that were\r\nsoon to follow. And when they came, in 1849, he pointed solemnly to the\r\ntruth of his teaching, and to the sadness of the moral, with the picture\r\nof \"King Hudson off the Line.\" Nothing could represent the situation\r\nmore eloquently or more concisely.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy incident occurred in connection with the Greek question of\r\n1850, when the English fleet threatened to blockade the Piræus. _Punch_\r\nwas indignant at this high-handed show of strength towards the little\r\nkingdom, and taking the mean-looking, grovelling British Lion by the ear\r\n(in his cartoon) asks him, \"Why don't you hit someone of your own size?\"\r\nWith the exception of the occasion when he disrespectfully represented\r\nthe noble beast as stuffed and moth-eaten, this is the only \"big cut\"\r\nwherein the Lion has been unworthily treated, or on which, in foreign\r\npolitics, _Punch_ has failed to back up his own Government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANTI-GRAHAM WAFERS.\r\n\r\n(_Designed by H. G. Hine._)]\r\n\r\nWhen Kossuth visited London in 1851, _Punch's_ heart, like that of the\r\nrest of England, went out to the patriot. \"It was not Louis Kossuth\r\nwhom the thousands gazed upon and cheered,\" wrote _Punch_. \"It was\r\nHungary--bound and bleeding, but still hopeful, resolute, defying\r\nHungary;\" and it may be observed that for many years _Punch_ sided, for\r\none reason or another, with Austria's successive adversaries.\r\n\r\nIt was in the same year that Lord Palmerston first appeared on _Punch's_\r\nscene, and then in his own selected _rôle_ of \"Judicious Bottle-holder.\"\r\nHe was represented as officiating thus at the little affair between\r\n\"Nick the Bear\" and \"Young Europe.\" From that time forward he always\r\nappeared as a sporting character, and rather gained than lost in popular\r\nfavour by the treatment. Another début the following year, among the\r\nrepeated appearances of \"Dizzy,\" Napoleon, Pam, and Lord John, was that\r\nof John Bright. He is shown in Quaker costume, examining the new-born\r\nbaby (the new Reform Bill) through an eye-glass, while Lord John, its\r\nparent, stands by and hears the dry verdict that it is \"not quite so\r\nfine a child as the last.\" This eye-glass perplexed John Bright a good\r\ndeal, because, said he, he had \"never worn such a thing in his life.\" He\r\ndid not see that the glass had here, no doubt, not so much reference to\r\nhim, as to the smallness of the birth examined by its aid.\r\n\r\nProtection was still a subject of debate, but not for long. In 1852\r\nappeared the admirable cartoon in which Cobden--suddenly come very much\r\nto the fore in _Punch's_ pages--is represented as Queen Eleanor, who\r\nadvances on Disraeli, a grotesque \"Fair Rosamond,\" with a poison-bowl of\r\n\"Free Trade\" in one hand and the dagger of \"Resignation\" in the other.\r\nDisraeli accepted the former, and _Punch_ and the Free Traders rejoiced.\r\nBut in their triumph they did not spare the feelings of the convert,\r\nwhom they had dubbed \"The Political Chameleon;\" but at least they\r\nadmitted the importance of the man, who is no longer sneeringly alluded\r\nto as \"Benjamin Sidonia,\" no more represented as an ill-bred schoolboy\r\nmade up of impudence and malice--unprincipled, vicious, and conceited.\r\n\r\nIn the following year _Punch_ sounded his first note of warning of the\r\napproaching \"Eastern Question,\" when in the cartoon of \"The Turkey in\r\nDanger,\" the Sick Bird is shown in the powerful hug of the Russian Bear;\r\nand \"The Emperor's Cup for 1853\" illustrates still further the\r\nprescience of _Punch_. Nevertheless, as has been said, he could not\r\nappreciate a _suaviter_ policy, and in a cartoon entitled \"Not a Nice\r\nBusiness\" (p. 271, Vol. XXVI.) Lord Aberdeen, the Premier, is shown\r\nengaged in cleaning the boots of the Tsar.\r\n\r\nHow the Crimean War was followed by _Punch_ in a magnificent series of\r\npictures, chiefly from the hand of Sir John Tenniel, as well as in that\r\nculminating effort of Leech's, \"General Février,\" there is no need here\r\nto explain. But during the peace negotiations--which were delayed\r\nthrough the Russians firing on a truce-party, called \"The Massacre of\r\nHango\"--the representation was unjustly made by _Punch_ that the King of\r\nPrussia was a confirmed toper, and the charge was offensively maintained\r\nby pen and pencil. This so angered the King that none of the English\r\nnewspaper correspondents (one of whom he supposed to be the original\r\nperpetrator of the libel) was after that allowed within the precincts of\r\nthe palace, until at last Mr. T. Harrington Wilson, one of _Punch's_\r\ndraughtsmen, was admitted on behalf of the \"Illustrated London News.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the Crimean War at an end, than the reprisals which\r\ndeveloped into the Chinese War involved this country in an expense of\r\nfour millions. In spite of the importance and gravity of the\r\nundertaking, _Punch_ vigorously supported Lord Palmerston in his\r\ncampaign, and mockingly showed \"The Great Warriors Dah-Bee and Cob-Den\"\r\nvainly trying to overturn his Government. He made good sport of the\r\nCelestials, as a matter of course, but his mortification was extreme on\r\nlearning that the incidental outlay would delay the hoped-for repeal of\r\nthe paper duty. He found a small outlet for his feelings in the cartoon\r\nrepresenting a Chinese mandarin as \"The New Paper-weight\" (p. 20, Vol.\r\nXXXIX.), but in the end was entirely conciliated by the terms of the\r\nChinese Convention, and the payment of a handsome indemnity--the subject\r\nof his first cartoon in 1861 being \"A Cheer for Elgin.\"\r\n\r\nItaly's successful struggle for independence received great attention\r\nand sympathy from _Punch_--the greater, no doubt, since the \"Papal\r\nAggression\" had taught him to look askance at the Vatican; but he\r\nregarded with extreme and well-justified scepticism the genuineness of\r\nLouis Napoleon's alleged disinterestedness in the interests of peace. He\r\nis ironically shown (October 13th, 1860) as \"The Friend in Need\"\r\nadvising the Pope, \"There, cut away quietly and leave me your keys. Keep\r\nup your spirits, and I'll look after your little temporal matters.\"\r\nGaribaldi and Victor Emmanuel were regarded by _Punch_ with the greatest\r\nfavour (just as the latter was said to be regarded privately by the\r\nPope), and United Italy was enthusiastically hailed by him (March, 1861)\r\nas \"The Latest Arrival\" at the European Evening Party conjointly\r\npresided over by John Bull and Britannia.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last _Punch_ has always been an Imperialist--Imperial\r\nDefence being warmly taken up at periodical intervals, and Imperial\r\nFederation during these latter years adopted as one of the planks of his\r\nPunch-and-Judy platform. Imperial Defence as a cry and a scare, begun in\r\n1848 on the action of the Prince de Joinville, was continued in 1860\r\n(cartoon, August 4th), when a large sum was spent upon arsenals and\r\ndockyards--to some extent, no doubt, in view of Napoleon's\r\ndouble-dealing in the matter of Nice and Savoy. \"Ribs of steel are our\r\nships, Engineers are our men,\" he sings, under the new order of things\r\nin naval construction--\r\n\r\n          \"We're steady, boys, steady,\r\n          But always unready;\r\n  We've just let the French get before us again.\"\r\n\r\nThe American War of Secession; the throne of Greece put up to auction;\r\nPoland in chains, defying the Russian Bear; the ghost of Charles I.\r\nwarning the King of Prussia, by the block to which he points, of the\r\npunishment that awaits the would-be despot; Napoleon crushing the\r\nprostrate figure of France; the wars between \"father-in-law Denmark,\"\r\nGermany, and Austria, and between the latter two (as Robbers in the\r\nWood); Reform; Irish Church Disestablishment; \"Dizzy\" as the\r\nPremier-Peri entering the gates of Paradise, or, bound to the Ixion's\r\nwheel of \"Minority,\" hurled forth by Hercules-Bright, with the severe\r\napproval of Juno-Britannia and Jupiter-Gladstone; the Franco-Prussian\r\nWar; the Royal marriages; the occupation of Egypt; and the creation of\r\nthe \"Empress of India;\"--all the subject-matter, indeed, of home and\r\nforeign politics, and of general public interest, have been touched upon\r\nby _Punch_ as they occurred, lightly, but often probed _à fond_. His\r\nattitude seldom caused much surprise, for his opinions and views could\r\ngenerally be foretold. It was the manner in which they were put forth\r\nthat carried weight and influence; they were the nation's ideas\r\n\r\n                      \"... to advantage dressed,\r\n  What oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed.\"\r\n\r\nThe student of the times, if he would know how public affairs struck the\r\npublic mind during that period, can assuredly find no truer, no more\r\naccurate indication than is offered by the perusal of _Punch's_ pages.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] \"Daily Chronicle,\" August 26th, 1892.\r\n\r\n[11] This, with the Pharaoh pro-Jewish picture at the time of the\r\nRussian persecutions, is said to be the only cartoon founded on a\r\nstrictly Biblical or Scriptural subject ever published in _Punch_.\r\n\r\n[12] _See_ p. 108, Vol. XXXIII.:--\r\n\r\n  \"And woe to the hell-hounds! Right well may they fear\r\n    A vengeance--ay, darker than war ever knew;\r\n  When Englishmen, charging, exchange the old cheer\r\n    For, 'REMEMBER THE WOMEN AND BABES WHOM THEY SLEW!'\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"And terrified India shall tell to all time,\r\n    How Englishmen paid her for murder and lust;\r\n  And stained not their fame with one spot of the crime\r\n    That brought the rich splendour of Delhi to dust.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\"CHARIVARIETIES.\"\r\n\r\n     _Punch's_ Influence on Dress and Fashion--His Records--As a\r\n     Prophet--As an Artist--As an Actor and Dramatist--Benefit\r\n     Performances--Guild of Literature and Art.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man who glances at _Punch's_ current number and throws it aside can\r\nhave but little appreciation of the influence of the paper, not only in\r\nmatters political, but in social subjects of every kind. That the Baron\r\nde Book-Worms can make or mar the success of a new book, as completely\r\nas the \"Times,\" \"Athenæum,\" or \"Spectator,\" has been testified to by Mr.\r\nHall Caine and others; and in some quarters at least _Punch's_\r\nbâton-strokes are as effective as ever, and recall the times when he\r\ncould, and did, drive a semi-public man into obscurity, which, but for\r\nthe fame of his onslaught, would have been absolute oblivion.\r\n\r\nBut it is in dress, in fashion, and in manners that _Punch_ has gained,\r\nif anything, in weight and influence. In such subjects, treated as\r\n\"charivarieties,\" as Mr. Arthur Sykes has called them, he has always\r\nbeen supreme, and fulfils an unquestioned destiny. John Leech determined\r\nthat there should be no Bloomerism in the land, and there was\r\nnone--only, by the charm of his drawings, he came very near making it\r\npopular, and converting British young womanhood to Turkish trousers. Mr.\r\ndu Maurier thought that it would look pretty if every little lady in the\r\nland were to wear black stockings; and every little lady did: as\r\nunfalteringly as when Miss Kate Greenaway imposed upon them smocks and\r\npoke-bonnets, or when Mrs. Hodgson Burnett clad mothers' darlings in\r\nblack velvet Fauntleroy suits, with bright-coloured sashes wound round\r\ntheir middles. As the volumes are examined, the reader becomes aware of\r\nthe enduring value of _Punch_ as a History of Costume in the Victorian\r\nEra. Even men's dress is noted with minute truthfulness--the violently\r\nvariegated shirts of 1845; the Joinville ties, with their great fringed\r\nends, out of which Thackeray made such capital in 1847; the pin-less\r\ncravats and cutaway coats of 1848; the ivory-handled canes of 1850, for\r\nsucking purposes--the fashion which came round thirty years later with\r\nthe advance of the \"crutch and toothpick brigade;\" the big bows and\r\nshort sticks of 1852; the frock-coats and weeping whiskers of 1853, with\r\nthe corresponding inability to pronounce the \"r\" otherwise than as a\r\n\"w,\" or to converse but with a languid, used-up drawl; the smaller ties\r\nand growing collars, when a wasting youth complains that \"She is lost to\r\nhim for ever\" (_she_, the laundress!); the schoolboy's Spanish hat of\r\n1860, that was soon developed into the \"pork-pie,\" and was to be adopted\r\ngenerally for country wear with baggy knickerbockers; the full-blown\r\nDundreary of 1861, with long weeping whiskers, long coat, long drawl,\r\nand short wits; with the sudden change for the better in the following\r\nyear. All this is to be found clearly recorded year by year, season by\r\nseason, with all the peculiarities of \"form;\" of umbrella and\r\numbrella-carrying; of dancing, energetic and invertebrate; of\r\nhandshaking, sensible and high-level (which was invented, of course, by\r\nthe ballroom girl who was holding up her train in the dance); of hirsute\r\nadornment and æsthetic craze--every shade of fashion is followed in its\r\ntrue development and in its wane--down to the recent phase of 1893 and\r\n1894, when the swell lets out his collar for an advertisement hoarding,\r\nor, safe in the perfection of its starching, marches quietly across the\r\ndesert while fierce Orientals turn the edges of their swords in vain\r\nacross his linen-shielded neck.\r\n\r\nAnd the ladies! The coal-scuttle bonnet and the incipient crinoline of\r\n1845; the growing crinolines of 1851, larger in 1860, largest of all in\r\n1864; the hair in bands or side-curls of 1852, and in nets in 1862; the\r\nbonnets worn almost off the head in 1853, more so in 1854, until Leech\r\ndrew a picture of two ladies walking out, with footmen carrying their\r\nheadgear behind them; the \"spoon-shaped bonnet\" of 1860--\"the latest\r\nParisian folly,\" which the street-boys mistake for \"a dustman's 'at;\"\r\nthe archery of 1862, the pork-pie hat, the croquet, the tennis, the\r\ngolf--every sport, every habit and custom, every change of dress, down\r\nto the minutest detail--all is recorded with faithfulness and humour,\r\nfirst by Leech's pencil, and then, in chief measure, by Mr. du\r\nMaurier's.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is curious in turning over _Punch's_ volumes to see how on occasion\r\nhe could use his power of prophecy with an accuracy that spoke well for\r\nthe common-sense, sometimes even the statesmanship, to be found among\r\nthe Staff. \"There is but one Punch, and he is his own prophet.\" It is\r\nrather as a social reformer than as a politician that he has exerted his\r\ngift, though an example of the latter class of foresight may be pointed\r\nto in the cartoon of Sir John Tenniel of April 7th, 1860. This was\r\nentitled \"A Glimpse of the Future: A Probable and Large Importation of\r\nForeign Rags,\" in which King Bomba of Naples, the Emperor Louis\r\nNapoleon, and the Pope were shown landing on British shores in very\r\nsorry plight. And in due time England was to see--at least, as far as\r\nthe two monarchs were concerned--the realisation of the oracular couplet\r\ncombined:--\r\n\r\n  \"The time will come when discontent\r\n  Will overthrow your Government.\"\r\n\r\nThen the number of inventions and innovations forestalled by _Punch's_\r\npen are many. In December, 1848, much is made of a proposed \"opera\r\ntelakouphanon\"--a forecast of the telephone, phonograph, and\r\ntheatrophone combined:--\r\n\r\n     \"It would be in the power of Mr. Lumley,\" says _Punch_, \"during the\r\n     aproaching holiday time to bring home the Opera to every lady's\r\n     drawing-room in London. Let him cause to be constructed at the back\r\n     of Her Majesty's Theatre an apparatus on the principle of the Ear\r\n     of DIONYSIUS.... Next, having obtained an Act of Parliament for the\r\n     purpose, let him lay down after the manner of pipes a number of\r\n     Telakouphona connected--the reader will excuse the apparent\r\n     vulgarism--with this ear, and extended to the dwellings of all such\r\n     as may be willing to pay for the accommodation. In this way our\r\n     domestic establishments might be served with the liquid notes of\r\n     JENNY LIND as easily as they are with soft water, and could be\r\n     supplied with music as readily as they can with gas. Then at a\r\n     _soirée_ or evening party, if a desire were expressed for a little\r\n     music, we should only have to turn on the _Sonnambula_ or the\r\n     _Puritani_, as the case might be,\" etc.\r\n\r\n--a thirty years' prophecy. The following year he represented a lady\r\nlistening to music by telegraph; and the kinetoscope is only now waiting\r\nto fulfil Mr. du Maurier's forecast of many years ago. If Mr. Edison has\r\nnot yet done quite all that Mr. Punch foretold, is not that rather Mr.\r\nEdison's than _Punch's_ fault?\r\n\r\nIn an unhappy moment in 1847 _Punch_ proposed the use of umbrellas and\r\nhouse-fronts for advertising purposes, and the hint was promptly taken.\r\nIn the previous year he foretold the use of the Thames Tunnel as a\r\nrailway conduit; and his sketch of a zebra harnessed to a carriage in\r\nthe streets of London was realised forty years later. The great \"Missing\r\nWord Competition\" of 1892 was forestalled by _Punch_ by four-and-thirty\r\nyears (p. 53, Vol. XXXV., August 7th, 1858). Leech's \"Mistress of the\r\nHounds,\" too--how fantastic the idea was thought in those days, and\r\nlaughed at accordingly!--has since become a hard, astraddle,\r\nuncompromising fact; and the lady's safety riding-skirt, that attached\r\nitself to the saddle when the lady lost her seat, anticipated by thirty\r\nyears the patent for a similar contrivance taken out in 1884. Indeed,\r\n_Punch's_ picture of November, 1854, was put in as evidence before Mr.\r\nJustice Wright in April, 1893, when an action between two sartorial\r\nartists turned upon the point of anteriority, and the picture won the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nCommon-sense, and shrewdness of observation and judgment, which are at\r\nthe root of amateur prophecy, brought as much honour to _Punch_ as ever\r\nOld Moore obtained through one of his lucky flukes. In December, 1893,\r\nthe Prince of Wales opened the Hugh Myddleton Board School, the finest\r\nin London, which had been erected on the site of the old Clerkenwell\r\nprison; and on the invitation card to the ceremony appeared a\r\nreproduction of the _Punch_ picture of May, 1847, which accompanied an\r\naltercation between \"School and Prison, who've lately risen As\r\nopposition teachers.\" This was published nearly a quarter of a century\r\nbefore Mr. Forster's Education Act, and concludes with the prophecy\r\ncuriously fulfilled in the case of this particular institution. To this\r\npicture, in which the county gaol, untenanted, looks scowlingly at the\r\ncrowded school, the Prince feelingly referred when he spoke of the\r\nscepticism with which the statement was regarded, that the institution\r\nof \"free\" schools would shut the prisons up. But a volume might be\r\nfilled with instances of the occasions on which _Punch_ has seen with\r\nhis eyes, and thought with the front of his brain--how his demands for\r\nnecessary innovations (such, for example, as fever carriages in 1861)\r\nwere quickly acted upon, and how his serious mood has enforced the\r\nrespect which mere geniality might have failed to secure.\r\n\r\nHe is not, of course, entitled to invariable congratulation for his\r\nattitude towards art; but he has suffered as well as acted ill. When he\r\nderided the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and joined in the storm of\r\nridicule that swirled round the heads of Rossetti and his devoted and\r\ncourageous friends, he doubtless acted within his _rôle_; but he utterly\r\nfailed to see below the surface of the apparent affectation of the\r\nartists, and all he had to say of Sir John Millais' \"Vale of Rest,\" in\r\nthe lines descriptive of the year 1859, was\r\n\r\n     \"Year Mr. Millais came out with those terrible nuns in the\r\n     graveyard.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following year, however, Mr. Eastlake, afterwards of the National\r\nGallery, made his mark in the paper as \"Jack Easel,\" and a more\r\nintelligent view of art prevailed.\r\n\r\nBut neither has Art, as personified by the Royal Academy, recognised\r\n_Punch_, save by a couple of seats at the annual banquet. It is true\r\nthat several of its members have drawn for it--Sir Frederic Leighton,\r\nSir John Millais, Sir John Gilbert, Mr. Briton Riviere, Mr. Stacey\r\nMarks, Mr. G. A. Storey, and Fred Walker. But _Punch's_ art has gone\r\nunnoticed, otherwise than by a square yard or two of wall space in the\r\nBlack-and-White room at the annual exhibition. While the Academy has\r\ncanonised many members whose names half a century later are forgotten,\r\nor are remembered only to be called up with a smile or a shrug, it has\r\npersistently ignored those who have employed the pencil instead of the\r\nbrush, or have used ink instead of misusing paint. But it is unnecessary\r\nto pursue the subject farther; that the names of Keene, Leech, and\r\nTenniel are not on the roll of the Academy is surely far more to the\r\ndiscredit of the institution than of the artists themselves, who\r\npresumably, from the Academic point of view, are \"no artists.\" As Mr. du\r\nMaurier has pointed out, _Punch's_ artists will have their revenge: \"If\r\nthe illustrator confine himself to his own particular branch, he must\r\nnot hope for any very high place in the hierarchy of art. The great\r\nprizes are not for him! No doubt it will be all the same a hundred years\r\nhence--but for this: if he has done his work well, he has faithfully\r\nrepresented the life of his time, he has perpetuated what he has seen\r\nwith his own bodily eyes; and for that reason alone his unpretending\r\nlittle sketches may, perhaps, have more interest for those who come\r\nacross them in another hundred years than many an ambitious historical\r\nor classical canvas that has cost its painter infinite labour,\r\nimagination, and research, and won for him in his own time the highest\r\nrewards in money, fame, and Academical distinction. For genius alone can\r\nkeep such fancy-work as this alive, and the so-called genius of to-day\r\nmay be the scapegoat of to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DRAUGHTSMAN'S REVENGE.\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by George du Maurier._)]\r\n\r\n_Punch_ was born, so to speak, upon the stage, between the four canvas\r\nwalls of his own and Judy's show. His heart and soul were with and of\r\nthe drama, and plays have rained from the prolific pens of his literary\r\nStaff. Many of his contributors acted in public--a few professionally,\r\nmost of them as amateurs--and more than one has linked his life with a\r\nlady who had trodden the stage or concert platform. From the first he\r\nproclaimed that Music and the Drama were to be amongst the most\r\nprominent features of the work; and to that declaration he has ever\r\nsince faithfully adhered. As a record of the London stage, the pages of\r\n_Punch_ are fairly complete; as a dramatist he has, through the members\r\nof his Staff, been prolific, and on the whole highly successful; as an\r\nactor he has at least enjoyed himself; and just as Falstaff was the\r\ncause of wit in others, he has unwittingly served the pirates of the\r\nstage, and to better purpose, too, than they deserved.\r\n\r\nWith \"readings,\" lectures, and \"entertainments,\" the members of\r\n_Punch's_ Staff have often come strikingly before the public; so much\r\nso, indeed, that they have stepped from their studies and studios on to\r\nthe platform as by a natural transition. Albert Smith's \"Overland Mail\"\r\nand \"The Ascent of Mont Blanc,\" with the extraordinary success that\r\nattended them, doubtless set the fashion to the band of men who were\r\nalways, in one sense at least, before the public. Thackeray's \"Four\r\nGeorges\" and the \"English Humorists\" raised the standard of quality at\r\nonce; and to that standard more than one of his contemporaries and\r\nsuccessors has aimed at attaining, even though they never hoped to\r\nsucceed. Every Editor of _Punch_--except perhaps Stirling\r\nCoyne--delivered such lectures in his day. Henry Mayhew took for his\r\nsubject that of which he had a complete mastery, \"London Labour and\r\nLondon Poor.\" Mark Lemon, whose knowledge of the metropolis was probably\r\neven more extensive and peculiar than Sam Weller's own, lectured on it\r\nin \"About London,\" and gave recitals of \"Falstaff\" with a certain\r\nmeasure of success. Shirley Brooks spoke, as he was so well qualified to\r\ndo, on \"The Houses of Parliament;\" and discourses were similarly\r\ndelivered by Tom Taylor. Mr. Burnand's bright \"Happy Thoughts\" readings\r\ncould be forgotten by none that heard them. James Hannay, laying humour\r\naside, lectured on the more serious aspects of literature; and Cuthbert\r\nBede talked of the literary and artistic friends of his Verdant Green\r\ncareer. Mr. Harry Furniss, with his delightful entertainments on\r\n\"Portraiture\" and \"The Humours of Parliament,\" achieved a success\r\nundreamed of by the earlier _Punch_ reciters; and Mr. du Maurier in his\r\n\"Social Pictorial Satire\" touched a literary and critical height that\r\ncharmed every audience by its humour, its delicacy, and its admirable\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nThe theatrical stars of half a century march through _Punch's_ pages in\r\nlong procession, and matters of high theatrical politics engage the\r\nattention from year to year. _Punch's_ interest in theatricals is hardly\r\nsurprising when it is remembered how closely identified with the drama\r\nhave been many members of the Staff. Douglas Jerrold was a successful\r\nplaywright before ever _Punch_ was heard of, and as the author of\r\n\"Black-Eyed Susan\" and \"Time Works Wonders\" he made his name popular\r\nwith many who had hardly heard of his connection with \"the great comic.\"\r\nIt has been computed that the _Punch_ writers, from first to last, have\r\ncontributed no fewer than five hundred plays to the stage; and it may be\r\nmentioned as a curious fact that to \"German Reed's\" each successive\r\nEditor of _Punch_ has contributed an \"Entertainment.\" The Staff has on\r\nseveral occasions been seen upon the boards; and on countless occasions\r\n_Punch_ has figured there, usually against his will. It but sufficed for\r\n_Punch_ to make a hit for hungry provincial actors, either of stock\r\ncompanies or on tour, to pounce upon it and work it up into a play or an\r\nentertainment. Jerrold's brother-in-law, W. J. Hammond, who was at one\r\ntime manager of the Strand Theatre, travelled with what must be\r\nconsidered the authorised show, thus described:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"A new Entertainment, called a\r\n\r\n  NIGHT\r\n\r\n  with\r\n\r\n  PUNCH!\r\n\r\n\r\nFounded on the Series of Celebrated Papers of that highly humorous\r\nPeriodical, from the pens of the acknowledged best Comic Writers of the\r\nday. Adapted and Arranged by R. B. Peake, Esq. As performed by Mr. W. J.\r\nHammond Forty-two successive nights at the New Strand Theatre.... After\r\nwhich, a Monopolylogue entitled the\r\n\r\n  LAST MAN;\r\n\r\n  or,\r\n\r\n  PUNCH OUT OF TOWN\"\r\n\r\n--with five characters, all performed by Hammond, the whole reaching its\r\nclimax when _Punch_, in _propria persona_, appeared and sang an\r\n\"Epilogue Song.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was Mrs. Caudle, of course, that offered a bait too tempting to\r\nbe resisted. There was Mrs. Keeley's authorised \"Mrs. Caudle\" in town;\r\nbut simultaneously Mrs. Caudles cropped up in every town in the country.\r\nOne of these was enacted by Mr. Warren, and his playbill of the Theatre\r\nRoyal, Gravesend, dated August 7th, 1845, is before me as I write. \"The\r\nREAL MRS. CAUDLE,\" he asserts, \"having received an enthusiastic welcome\r\nfrom a Gravesend audience, and being pronounced far superior to any of\r\nthe _counterfeit Representatives_, will have the honour of repeating her\r\nCurtain Lecture this and to-morrow evenings.\" \"Mrs. Caudle at Gravesend\"\r\nwas, in fact, a \"Comic Sketch\" by C. Z. Barnett; and the programme\r\ndecorated with a common engraving in impudent imitation of Leech's\r\nimmortal cut, contained all the _dramatis personæ_ of Jerrold's little\r\ndomestic drama, including \"Mrs. Caudle (the Original from _Punch's_\r\nPapers), Mr. WARREN.\"\r\n\r\nSix years later Mr. Briggs himself was lifted from _Punch_ on to the\r\nstage (amongst others) of the Royal Marylebone Theatre, which then\r\nassiduously cultivated the equestrian drama. On November 14th, 1851, for\r\nthe benefit of a lady called MRS. MORETON BROOKES, there was played a\r\n\"new grand dramatic equestrian spectacle, entitled the MAID OF\r\nSARAGOSSA; OR, THE DUMB SPY AND STEED OF ARRAGON--realising Sir David\r\nWilkie's Celebrated Picture.\" As the Arragon Steed remained on the\r\npremises when the curtain fell on the first piece, it was obviously a\r\npity to waste him; so, after he had finished realising Wilkie's picture,\r\nand had rested awhile, he stepped out of romance into high comedy, or,\r\nas the playbill simply put it--\"After which will be presented from\r\nSketches furnished from PUNCH'S Domicile, Fleet Street, a New, Grand,\r\nLocomotive, Pedestrian, Equestrian, Go-ahead Extravaganza, entitled\r\n\r\n  =MR. BRIGGS=!\r\n\r\n  Or, HOUSE KEEPING _versus_ HORSE KEEPING\"--\r\n\r\nin which Mr. Briggs was played by Mr. Crowther, and Mrs. Briggs by the\r\nfair _beneficiaire_.\r\n\r\nThe first dramatic effort of _Punch_, in his individual quality and\r\npersonality as a jester, was the pantomime of \"King John, or Harlequin\r\nand Magna Charta.\" _Punch_ had at that time become so popular, and was\r\nso generally regarded as the incarnation of all that was witty, that a\r\ncommission was given for a pantomime that was to surpass for wit and\r\nhumour any pantomime that had ever been written or thought of before.\r\n\"They have given out,\" said Alfred Bunn in his vituperative \"Word with\r\nPunch,\" \"in distinct terms that none but themselves can write a\r\npantomime, and modestly entitled the one they _did_ write '_Punch's_\r\nPantomime' ... which they laboured so lustily, but so vainly, to puff\r\ninto notoriety.\" It was written in 1842, by Lemon, Jerrold, and Henry\r\nMayhew; but when it was read by the first-named to the Covent Garden\r\nCompany, by whom it was produced, it was found to contain a great deal\r\nof wit, but very little fun. It was extensively amended in response to\r\nthe representations of the pantomimists, and W. H. Payne managed to make\r\na good deal of his part. The wit, however, militated greatly against the\r\n\"go\" and success of the piece, the prestige of its writers did not help\r\nit, and the experiment of a \"_Punch's_ Pantomime\" was accordingly not\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nThe cordial sympathy that has bound together so many of _Punch's_ Staff\r\nin life has more than once taken the form of kindly charity in death or\r\nmisfortune. To the performance given on behalf of the unhappy Angus\r\nReach reference is made where the man and his work are considered. For\r\nLeigh Hunt--although he was not of the band--a theatrical performance\r\nwas also given, and realised a large sum, and the benefit in aid of\r\nCharles H. Bennett's widow and children was even more successful. That\r\ninteresting event is described later; but for the sake of history it may\r\nbe well to reproduce the programme here:--\r\n\r\n     AMATEUR PERFORMANCE AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, MANCHESTER,\r\n\r\n     (kindly placed at the disposal of the committee by John Knowles,\r\n     Esq.,)\r\n\r\n     MONDAY EVENING, JULY 29, 1867.\r\n\r\n     To commence with an entirely new and original Triumviretta, in one\r\n     act and ten tableaux (being a lyrical version of Mr. Maddison\r\n     Morton's celebrated farce of \"Box and Cox\"), by Mr. F.

Forsyth, St. Ann's Street.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, says an anonymous writer, \"The celebrated cartoonist\r\nreceived the reception of the evening. The audience rose _en masse_ and\r\ncheered. Tom Taylor, playing in his own piece the principal character,\r\nwas, comparatively speaking, nowhere. The most interesting personality\r\nof the _Punch_ Staff was unquestionably Tenniel.\"\r\n\r\nAffiliated with _Punch_, in its membership at least, was that \"Guild of\r\nLiterature and Art\" of which Charles Dickens was the father. Its\r\ntheatrical career began in 1845 at the Royalty Theatre, Soho, at that\r\ntime called Miss Kelly's, the initial performance being Ben Jonson's\r\n\"Every Man in his Humour,\" with Mark Lemon as Brainworm and Dickens as\r\nBobadil. (_See p. 137._) On May 15th, 1848, much the same company, in\r\naid of the fund for the endowment of the perpetual curatorship of\r\nShakespeare's house at Stratford-on-Avon, gave the \"Merry Wives of\r\nWindsor,\" when Dickens played Shallow; George Cruikshank, Pistol; John\r\nLeech, Slender; Mark Lemon, Falstaff; and other characters were\r\nrepresented by George Henry Lewes, John Forster, Dudley Costello,\r\nAugustus Egg, R.A., and Mr. Cowden Clarke--a goodly company. Mr. Sala\r\nsays that Lemon's conception of Falstaff (which was also known to the\r\npublic through the jovial editor's \"readings\"), though well understood,\r\nwas \"the worst he ever saw;\" but Mrs. Cowden Clarke declared it \"a fine\r\nembodiment of rich, unctuous raciness, no caricature, rolling greasiness\r\nand grossness, no exaggerated vulgarisation of Shakespeare's\r\nimmortal 'fat knight,' but a florid, rotund, self-indulgent\r\nvoluptuary--thoroughly at his ease, thoroughly prepared to take\r\nadvantage of all gratification that might come in his way, and\r\nthoroughly preserving the manners of a gentleman accustomed to the\r\ncompanionship of a prince. John Leech's Master Slender,\" she continues,\r\n\"was picturesquely true to the gawky, flabby, booty squire.... His mode\r\nof sitting on a stile, with his long ungainly legs dangling down ...\r\never and anon ejaculating his maudlin cuckoo cry of 'Oh sweet Ann Page,'\r\nwas a delectable treat.\" Without disrespect to Leech's memory, it may be\r\nsaid that others of his friends did not form a similarly favourable\r\nopinion of his histrionic powers.\r\n\r\nA company quite as notable in its way was that which played \"Not so Bad\r\nas We Seem,\" by Lytton (with whom _Punch_ had made his peace), at\r\nDevonshire House, on May 27th, 1851, before the Queen and the Prince\r\nConsort, at the instance of the Duke of Devonshire. The playbill\r\ndeserves to be preserved here, although the only _Punch_ names among the\r\nactors are those of Jerrold, Lemon, and Tenniel--the last-named of whom\r\nis the only survivor of them all.\r\n\r\n MEN.\r\n\r\n The Duke of Middlesex { Peers Attached To the Son  }  Mr. Frank Stone,\r\n                                                       A.R.A.\r\n The Earl of Loftus    { of James II., Commonly     }  Mr. Dudley Costello\r\n                       { Called the First Pretender\r\n\r\n Lord Wilmot           { a Young Man at the Head    }  Mr. Charles Dickens\r\n                       { of the Mode More Than a    }\r\n                       { Century Ago, Son To Lord   }\r\n                       { Loftus                     }\r\n\r\n Mr. Shadowly Softhead { a Young Gentleman From the }  Mr. Douglas Jerrold\r\n                       { City, Friend and Double    }\r\n                       { of Lord Wilmot             }\r\n\r\n Mr. Hardman           { a Rising Member of         }  Mr. John Forster\r\n                         Parliament\r\n                       { and Adherent To Sir        }\r\n                       { Robert Walpole             }\r\n\r\n Sir Geoffrey Thornside{ a Gentleman of Good Family }  Mr. Mark Lemon\r\n                       { and Estate                 }\r\n\r\n Mr. Goodenough Easy   { in Business, Highly        }  Mr. F.

In this low estimate, of\r\ncourse, are not included the work of the few regular contributors who\r\nare recognised, though \"unattached,\" as well as of the others who make a\r\npractice of sending every good new joke they hear to such a friend as\r\nthey may happen to have on the Staff. These two classes are not\r\nnumerous; but they are, and have for years formed, a little body of\r\nbright-witted, laughter-loving persons, to whom _Punch_ and _Punch_\r\nreaders are under an equal debt of gratitude.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the providing of jokes for illustration in the\r\ncomic press is to some extent a recognised, if a limited and illiberal,\r\nprofession, he who follows it being commonly described as the \"Unknown\r\nMan.\" Endowed with natural wit and invention, but denied the gift of\r\ndraughtsmanship, this \"dumb orator\" is supposed to turn out jokes as\r\nother men would turn out chair-legs, and sends them in priced, like\r\ngloves, at so much a dozen, \"on approval--for sale or return,\" with a\r\nsuggested _mise en scène_ complete, which the illustrator is\r\nrecommended to adopt. How far the system answers its purpose I am\r\nunable to judge; but if the experience of Mr. Phil May may be taken as\r\nan example, there is every reason why the Man should remain Unknown.\r\nFor, at the suggestion of a fellow-artist, he ordered five dollars-worth\r\nof original jokes, the price being quoted at a dollar per joke. His\r\norder was executed with punctuality and despatch, when Mr. May found, to\r\nhis amusement and dismay, that three of the jokes were former _Punch_\r\nfriends, and the remaining two were old ones of his own invention!\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom the joke-contributor is as a rule a disinterested\r\nperson, usually seeking neither pay nor recognition; and so far as his\r\nestimate bears upon the value of his contribution, it must be admitted\r\nthat his judgment is generally sound. But of the accepted jokes from\r\nunattached contributors, it is a notable fact that at least seventy-five\r\nper cent. come from North of the Tweed. Dr. Johnson, ponderous enough in\r\nhis own humour, admitted that \"much may be made of a Scotchman if he be\r\ncaught young;\" and it is probable that to him, as well as to\r\nWalpole--who suggested that proverbial surgical operation--is owing much\r\nof the false impression entertained in England as to Scottish\r\nappreciation of humour and of \"wut.\" Some may retort that it is just the\r\npreponderance of Scotch collaboration that has rendered _Punch_ at times\r\na trifle dull. Certain it is that _Punch_ is keenly appreciated in the\r\nNorth. In one of the public libraries of Glasgow it has been ascertained\r\nthat it was second favourite of all the papers there examined by the\r\npublic; and it has been asserted that in one portion of the moors and\r\nwaters gillies have more than once been heard to say, \"Eh, but that's a\r\nguid ane! Send that to Charlie Keene!\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it must be admitted that _Punch's_ dialect has not always\r\npleased up there, where \"the execrable attempts at broad Scotch which\r\nappear weekly in our old friend _Punch_\" have before now been\r\nauthoritatively denounced. Under the heading of \"Probable Deduction\"\r\n_Punch_ had the following paragraph:--\"A pertinacious Salvation Army\r\ncaptain was worrying a Scotch farmer, whom he met in the train, with\r\nperpetual inquiries as to whether 'he had been born again of Water and\r\nthe Spirit.' At last McSandy replied, 'Aweel, I dinna reetly ken how\r\nthat may be, but my good old feyther and mither took their toddy\r\nreleegiously every nicht, the noo.\" Referring to this story--first\r\ncousin surely to Lover's joke in \"Handy Andy\" of the Irish witness who,\r\nwhen pressed as to his mother's religion, promptly replied, \"She tuk\r\nwhuskey in her tay!\"--the critic remarks, \"It is pretty wit; for\r\n_Punch_. But McSandy ought to speak in the Scottish tongue. Now, if\r\n'night' is 'nicht,' why is 'right' 'reet'--either 'the noo' or at any\r\nother time? Hoots awa.\" Yet _Punch_ has usually taken great pains to\r\nverify his dialects, and Charles Keene--to whom the legends usually came\r\nfrom his friends ready-made and carefully elaborated--would, as a rule,\r\nseek to have them confirmed by one or other of his Scottish friends in\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest service that any Scot ever rendered to _Punch_\r\n(apart from drawing for it) was the \"puir bodie\" who explained that he\r\nfound Lunnon so awfu' extravagant that he hadna been in it more than a\r\nfew hours \"_when bang went saxpence!_\" The reader will be interested to\r\nlearn that this expression--which may truthfully be said to have passed\r\ninto the language--did really issue from the lips of a visitor from the\r\nneighbourhood of Glasgow. It was Sir John Gilbert who heard it, and\r\nrepeated it to Mr. Birket Foster while they were seated resting from\r\ntheir labours of \"hanging\" in the galleries of the Royal Water Colour\r\nSociety. On the private-view day that followed, Mr. Foster tried the\r\neffect of the joke on two ladies whom he accompanied into Bond Street to\r\ntake tea; and as they exploded with laughter, he concluded that it was\r\ngood enough for his friend Keene, to whom he thereupon sent it. The\r\nimmediate success of the joke was amazing; and Mr. Foster was therefore\r\nthe more surprised and amused a year afterwards to overhear a young\r\n\"masher\" calmly inform a barmaid serving on the Brighton pier that he\r\nwas the originator of it, and that he possessed the original drawing!\r\n\r\nAnother favourite Scotch picture of Keene's is that in which a drunken\r\nworkman, remonstrated with by the parson, protests that the latter is\r\nalways blaming him for his drinking, but \"You forget my droth!\" This\r\nincident really occurred at Pitlochrie, and was told by the minister\r\nhimself to Mr. Birket Foster, who handed it on to Keene; but--and here\r\ncomes out one of the charming qualities of Keene's character--the real\r\noffender was not a man, but a woman. It was a chivalrous practice of\r\nCharles Keene's never to show a woman in a really undignified position;\r\nand when he was remonstrated with on the subject, on the ground that he\r\ndistorted the truth unnecessarily, he would reply that \"he could not be\r\nhard on the sex.\" But though \"bang went saxpence\" is a notable _Punch_\r\njoke--and it may be remarked that it is not less beloved of the\r\npolitical economist than of the Saturday Reviewer--it is not quite the\r\nbest known. That position is easily attained by what is undoubtedly the\r\nmost successful (that is to say, the most popular) _mot_ of its kind\r\never composed in the English language.\r\n\r\nIt appeared in the Almanac for 1845 under \"January,\" and, based upon the\r\ningenious wording of an advertisement widely put forth by Eamonson &\r\nCo., well-known house furnishers of the day, ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\nWORTHY OF ATTENTION.\r\n\r\nADVICE TO PERSONS ABOUT TO MARRY,--Don't![13]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether any line from any author is so often quoted as\r\n\"_Punch's_ advice.\" It crops up continually, almost continuously, though\r\nnot exactly when least to be expected, as experience teaches us to\r\nexpect it always; and I may assert from my own observation that it\r\nappears in one or other of the papers of the kingdom on an average twice\r\nor thrice a week. Perhaps what has lent additional piquancy to _Punch's_\r\npiece of quaint philosophy is the mystery hitherto surrounding its\r\nauthorship. An inquirer who endeavoured a few years ago to solve the\r\nproblem set on record the result of his researches, by which, according\r\nto a Scotch authority, he is said to have found the author in (1) a\r\npoliceman of Glasgow, (2) a bricklayer of Edinburgh, (3) a railway\r\nofficial at Perth, (4) a compositor in Dundee, (5) an hotel-keeper in\r\nInverness, and (6) a \"Free Press\" reporter in Aberdeen. English and\r\nIrish evidently had no chance. A letter, professing to explain the whole\r\nmystery, which lies before me from a medical correspondent, under date\r\nApril 7th, 1895, runs as follows: \"When in practice as a medical man at\r\nNeath, in S. Wales, it was well known to have been written by Mr.\r\nCharles Waring, a Quaker living at 'The Darran,' near Neath Abbey. Mr.\r\nWaring removed from there to the neighbourhood of Bristol about\r\ntwenty-two years ago. The proprietors of _Punch_ were so pleased, they\r\nsent him a _douceur_ of £10 for the contribution!\" Further inquiry shows\r\nthat the late Mr. Waring was merely in the habit of quoting, not of\r\nclaiming, the joke.\r\n\r\nHearing Charles Keene's emphatic opinion that the author was a Miss\r\nFrances D----, who many years ago was living in a remote village in the\r\nNorth of England, and who had been paid £5 for the line, I appealed to\r\nthe Post Office for help to trace the lady out; and through the kindly\r\nassistance of the officials at St. Martin's-le-Grand and elsewhere,\r\nalthough nearly half a century had elapsed, I discovered her in another\r\nvillage equally remote, the Post Office having courteously obtained her\r\npermission to place me in communication with her. But the information\r\nwas of a negative kind. She was, she protested, quite innocent of the\r\ncredit of _Punch's_ Monumental Cynicism, and consequently had never been\r\nthe recipient of the fantastic payment of £5 per line. But since that\r\ntime chance has placed in my possession the authoritative information;\r\nand so far from any outsider, anonymous or declared, paid or unpaid,\r\nbeing concerned in it at all, the line simply came in the ordinary way\r\nfrom one of the Staff--from the man who, with Landells, had conceived\r\n_Punch_ and shaped it from the beginning, and had invented that first\r\nAlmanac which had saved the paper's life--Henry Mayhew.\r\n\r\nTo trace the history of much of _Punch's_ original humour would hardly\r\nbe desirable, even were it possible. But there are many examples of it\r\nwhich, while essentially original to _Punch_, have yet sprung from\r\ncircumstances independent of it, and are in themselves amusing enough to\r\nbe related, or which otherwise present points of interest. To some of\r\nthese I call attention, for they illustrate _Punch's_ own aphorism that\r\n\"it is easier to make new friends than new jokes.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a capital story in Mr. Le Fanu's \"Seventy Years of Irish Life,\"\r\nin which the author tells of a man who was accidentally knocked down by\r\nthe buffer of a locomotive near Bray Station. He was not seriously hurt,\r\nand but partially stunned; and the porters who quickly ran to the spot\r\ndetermined to take him to the station at once. The hero of the accident,\r\noverhearing where they were carrying him, imagined that he was being\r\ngiven in charge. \"What do you want to take me to the station for?\" he\r\nasked. \"You know me; and if I've done any damage to your d----d engine,\r\nsure I'm ready to pay for it!\" This story of Mr. Le Fanu's reached\r\nKeene's ears long before the author incorporated it in his book, and\r\nwith the change of hardly a word it illustrated one of the best drawings\r\nthe artist ever drew.\r\n\r\nThough undoubtedly many of _Punch's_ jokes are deliberately\r\nmanufactured, or else improved from actual incidents, a vast\r\nnumber--like that quoted just now--are used with but slight textual\r\nediting, just as they occurred. Thus Joe Allen it was--the light-hearted\r\nartist who contributed an article to _Punch's_ first number--who\r\nprovided Mr. du Maurier years afterwards with that \"social agony\" in\r\nwhich a great lover of children, invited to a juvenile party, bursts\r\ninto the room with the cry of \"Here we are again\"--walking in on his\r\nhands like a clown--to find that he had come to the wrong house next\r\ndoor, and was scandalising a sedate and stately dinner party. Henry\r\nMayhew had a story of which a facetious police officer of his\r\nacquaintance was the hero. The latter was driving \"Black Maria\" along\r\nthe street when he was hailed by a waggish omnibus-driver who affected\r\nto mistake the depressing character of the passing vehicle. \"Any room?\"\r\nhe asked. \"Yes,\" replied the officer, with a grin, \"we've kept a place\r\non purpose for you. Jump inside!\" \"What's the fare?\" inquired the\r\nhumorist, a little \"non-plushed,\" as Jeames expressed it, at the\r\nunexpected retort. \"Same as you had before--bread and water, and skilly\r\no' Sundays!\" The joke duly appeared in _Punch_ after a long interval\r\n(Vol. XLVI.), illustrated by Charles Keene, under the title of\r\n\"Frightful Levity.\"\r\n\r\nAnother omnibus story, printed just as it occurred, was that in which a\r\nconductor replies to an old gentleman in the south of London, whose\r\ndestination was the \"Elephant and Castle.\" \"Yus--you go on to the\r\nCircus, and change into a Helephant.\" \"Oh, mamma!\" exclaims a little\r\ngirl seated near the door, \"do let's go too!\" \"Go where?\" \"To the\r\ncircus, and see the old gentleman change into an elephant!\" A similar\r\nincident, it may be observed, was illustrated by Eltze's pencil in 1861,\r\nwhen a passenger in the \"Highbury Bus\" asks the conductor to \"change\r\nhim into a Hangel.\" Jack Harris has often appeared in _Punch_. He was a\r\ndriver beside whom Mr. Edmund Yates often rode--\"a wonderfully humorous\r\nfellow, whose queer views of the world and real native wit afforded me\r\nthe greatest amusement. A dozen of the best omnibus sketches were\r\nfounded on scenes which had occurred with this fellow, and which I\r\ndescribed to John Leech, whose usually grave face would light up as he\r\nlistened, and who would reproduce them with inimitable fun.\"\r\n\r\nThe horrified swell of Leech's who is implored by an onion-hawker to\r\n\"take the last rope\" was in reality his friend Mr. Horsley, R.A., by\r\nwhom the artist was provided with a number of humorous subjects. The\r\nunfailing advantage taken by Leech of all such contributions, which his\r\nfriends assured him were \"not copyright,\" has been universally\r\nrecognised. Among the subjects suggested to him by Dean Hole was that in\r\nwhich his coachman, \"unaccustomed to act as waiter, watched, with great\r\nagony of mind, the jelly which he bore swaying to and fro, and set it\r\ndown upon the table with a gentle remonstrance of 'Who--a, who--a,\r\nwho--a,' as though it were a restive horse.\" By a curious coincidence,\r\nas I have heard from the lips of a member of one of the great brewing\r\nfirms, on the very day before the appearance of Mr. du Maurier's\r\ndrawing[14] the identical incident had occurred in his own house, and it\r\nwas hard to believe on the following morning that the subject of his\r\nplunging blanc-mange, similarly apostrophised, had not been imported by\r\nsome sort of magic into _Punch's_ page. A similar coincidence, far\r\ngraver in its first suggestion, has been given me by Mr. Arnold-Forster.\r\nA friend of his sent in to _Punch_ a comic sketch of the Tsar travelling\r\nby railway, while he sent a decoy train _in the opposite\r\ndirection_--which was blown up! The paper containing the sketch was\r\nprinted by the Monday, and before it was published that had really\r\noccurred which _Punch_ had playfully invented. Until the following week,\r\nwhen an explanation was published, a certain section of the public\r\ncriticised, with justifiable severity, what they took to be the bad\r\ntaste and ill-timed fooling of the Jester.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Harry Furniss's pen came an oft-quoted drawing (lately used as\r\nan advertisement), the idea of which reached him from an anonymous\r\ncorrespondent. It is that of the grimy, unshaven, unwashed,\r\nmangy-looking tramp, who sits down to write, with a broken quill, a\r\ntestimonial for a firm of soap-makers: \"I used your Soap two years ago;\r\n_since then I've used no other_.\" A further point of interest about this\r\nfamous sketch was that Charles Keene was deeply offended by it at\r\nfirst--in the groundless belief that it was intended as a skit upon\r\nhimself. It must at least be admitted that the head is not unlike what\r\none might have expected to belong to a dissipated and dilapidated\r\nCharles Keene. But the nature of Mr. Furniss's work was of such a kind,\r\nand the artist himself has always overflowed with so prodigal a flood of\r\noriginal quaintness, that comparatively few sketches were ever sent in\r\nto him, or, being sent, were used. The origin of one of his\r\ncreations--that of the Sergeant-at-Arms as a beetle--is an example of\r\nthe lightness and quickness of his fancy. This representation, it has\r\nbeen said, was generally supposed to bear some spiteful sort of\r\nreference to the shape of Captain Gosset's legs, which in breeches and\r\nsilk stockings did not perhaps appear to the best advantage; and,\r\nfurther, that the idea was suggested by the appearance on the floor of\r\nthe House of Commons, in the course of a particularly wearisome debate,\r\nof a monster black-beetle marching slowly across under the eyes of the\r\nRepresentatives of the People, breaking the monotony of the proceedings,\r\nand arousing altogether disproportionate interest among the yawning\r\nmembers; that the \"stranger\" was quickly spied by the artist, who about\r\nthis time had to complain that certain facilities had been refused him\r\nby the Sergeant-at-Arms, and who, in retaliation, professed\r\nthenceforward to believe that the two creatures were identical. But the\r\ninsinuation was untrue. For the Sergeant was already an established\r\ninsect in _Punch_ before the appearance of the genuine black-beetle;\r\nand, moreover, so little did he resent it, that he used to stick the\r\namusing little libels all round his mantelpiece.\r\n\r\nThe national practice of sending in alleged jokes to _Punch_--a\r\npractice, I imagine, of which the result is sufficient to prove how\r\ndeficient in wit, if not in humour, is the English people considered as\r\na community--is doubtless a convenient one to the many persons who live\r\nupon a fraudulent reputation of being \"outside,\" and of course\r\nanonymous, _Punch_ contributors. \"How clever of you!\" said a lady in one\r\nwell-authenticated case to just such an impostor; \"how very clever you\r\nmust be! And what is it you write in _Punch_?\" \"Oh, all the best things\r\nare mine.\" The difficulty which Thomas Hood actually experienced in\r\nestablishing his authorship of \"The Song of the Shirt\" is recorded in\r\nits proper place; while, among other things, Mr. Milliken's \"Childe\r\nChappie\" was claimed, as was afterwards ascertained, by a literary ghoul\r\nwhose strange taste it was to batten upon the comic writings of others,\r\nand to use his borrowed reputation to ingratiate himself with the fair\r\nand trusting sex.\r\n\r\nNot a few of _Punch's_ jokes have been sent in by men who were destined\r\na little later on to become members of the Staff and diners at the\r\nTable. Mr. Furniss's first drawing, as is duly explained elsewhere, was\r\nre-drawn by Mr. du Maurier, and Mr. Burnand's initial contribution--a\r\nlittle sketch of 'Varsity life--was re-drawn by Leech. But quite a\r\nnumber of non-professional wits and humorists have acted as\r\ndisinterested friends, whose benevolent assistance has gone far to\r\ncolour _Punch_ with the characteristics of their own _vis comica_. The\r\nchief of these no doubt is Mr. Joseph Crawhall, of Newcastle, whose\r\ndevoted service to his friend Charles Keene was an important factor in\r\nthe artist's _Punch_-life. From his other friends, Mr. Birket Foster and\r\nMr. Andrew Tuer, Keene was in receipt of a great number of jokes--from\r\nthe latter they came almost as regularly as the weekly paper. It was\r\nalso from Mr. Tuer that he received, among many others, that happy\r\nthought, so happily realised, of the gentleman who one day paid an\r\nunaccustomed visit to his stables to give an order, and asking his\r\ncoachman's child, \"Well, my little man, do you know who I am?\" received\r\nfor answer, \"Yes, you're the man who rides in our carriage.\" This story\r\nwas quoted seven years later by Lord Aberdeen in a public speech, in\r\nwhich he attributed the adventure--though on what grounds did not\r\nappear--to \"a celebrated physician,\" apparently Sir Andrew Clark.\r\n\r\nAfter Charles Keene's death Mr. Tuer's humorous vein was turned on to\r\nothers of the Staff. One of his contributions may be quoted as\r\nillustrating how unintentional are the originals of some of _Punch's_\r\njokes. In 1889 appeared a picture entitled \"A New Trade,\" in which a\r\ncountry maid, on being asked what her last employer was, replied, \"He\r\nkept a Vicarage.\" The circumstance had actually taken place in Mr.\r\nTuer's own house. When the number appeared, the legend was read out to\r\nthe maid, and it was explained to her that it was _her_ joke. She showed\r\nno enthusiasm, not even appreciation; but on seeing the others laugh,\r\nshe said, with perfect gravity, yet still with hopeful perseverance,\r\n\"Well, I must try and make some more!\"\r\n\r\nTo Canon Ainger, also, among a crowd of willing helpers, has Mr. du\r\nMaurier often been indebted--for jokes rather scholarly than farcical,\r\nsuch as the parody spoken by a wretched passenger leaving the\r\nsteamboat--\r\n\r\n  \"Take, O boatman, thrice thy fee--\r\n  I've been as ill as any three!\"\r\n\r\nMost, perhaps, resembling the \"Unknown Man\" of the United States already\r\nspoken of is Mr. Henry Walker, of Worcester, a gentleman of wit and\r\nartistic knowledge. It had for many years been his practice, whenever\r\ninspired with a good idea for a humorous drawing, to make a sketch of it\r\nin his album; and thus he had collected a goodly number. At first he\r\nwould send his sketches to Keene from time to time, receiving due\r\npecuniary acknowledgment in return, but later on he left the whole book\r\nwith Mark Lemon to draw from as he listed. Altogether, between the years\r\n1867 and 1869, Keene made fifteen drawings from Mr. Walker's book, in\r\nsome cases keeping close to the original designs, in others entirely\r\naltering them; but in that re-drawn by Mr. du Maurier from the sketch\r\nhere reproduced, the original has been greatly departed from and\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"MUSICAL.\"\r\n\r\n_Eminent Musician:_ \"You play, I believe?\"\r\n\r\n_Swell Amateur:_ \"Ya-as!\"\r\n\r\n_Eminent Musician:_ \"The concertina?\"\r\n\r\n_Swell Amateur:_ \"No--the comb!\"\r\n\r\n(_From the Sketch by Henry Walker._)]\r\n\r\nIt may be added that when _Punch_ artists re-draw and touch up an\r\noutsider's sketch, it is their usual practice not to sign their\r\ndrawings, but to leave them without any indication of their authorship.\r\n\r\nApart from these willing contributors are those from whom the Editor,\r\nalways on the look-out for new blood and fresh wit, invites\r\ncontributions, having seen good work of theirs elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Eminent Musician:_ \"You play, I believe?\"\r\n\r\n  _Swell Amateur:_ \"Ya-as!\"\r\n\r\n  _Eminent Musician:_ \"Concertina?\"\r\n\r\n  _Swell Amateur:_ \"No--comb!\"\r\n\r\n(_Reduced from the Drawing by G. du Maurier in \"Punch,\" 20th June,\r\n1868._)]\r\n\r\nIt is often thus that _Punch's_ ranks are recruited, and that Mr. Lucy,\r\nMr. Lehmann, Mr. Partridge, Mr. Phil May, and others have been drawn\r\ninto the agreeable vortex of Whitefriars.\r\n\r\nOn at least one occasion, however, _Punch_ threw his kerchief in vain,\r\nfor Mr. Bristed tells us, in his \"Five Years at an English University,\"\r\nhow the Epigram Club, of Oxford, was invited by the Editor to send its\r\nproductions to _Punch_, but that \"with true English reserve\" the Society\r\ncame to an agreement that all their transactions should remain in\r\nmanuscript.\r\n\r\nBeside the editor of a comic journal stalks a demon on either hand--the\r\nBelial of Plagiarism and the Beelzebub of Repetition. The public looks\r\nto him to be a wit and a humorist, with a knowledge of every witticism\r\nthat ever was made. If he suffer an old joke to appear, some \"constant\r\nreader\" will surely find him out, and publish the fact abroad with\r\nmalignant glee. There are few vices so deeply resented as the telling of\r\nan old joke; in an editor it is recognised as amounting to crime. But\r\nthose who judge so severely have clearly never made a scientific study\r\nof the Joke. It is not sufficient to analyse a witticism and dissect it,\r\nin the cold spirit of that terrible book called \"A Theory of Wit and\r\nHumour,\" till its humour flies, like the delicate bouquet from uncorked\r\nwine. The genealogy of jokes and twists of humour and of thought, of\r\nform and application, must be traced; and the student will find that in\r\nrespect to a great proportion of our verbal jests of to-day they may be\r\ntracked up to the Middle Ages, back to Classic times, and lost perchance\r\nin the Oriental recesses of a jocular past. It is not only a case of\r\nmere unconscious repetition or of brazen-faced plagiarism that is the\r\nprinciple involved; it has its root in the chameleon-like variety of\r\naspect possible to a piece of fooling or a flash of wit. Jokes are as\r\nadaptable to times and circumstances, as the human race itself; and to\r\nidentify them and pin them down on a specimen card, one must be another\r\nPastor Aristæus, alert and skilful, in pursuit of a lightning Proteus,\r\ninfinitely various and hopelessly volatile.\r\n\r\nBut even that is not enough. Suppose the editor to be a scholar, deeply\r\nread in the Classics and in Oriental writings, and endowed besides with\r\na memory so prodigious as to be able to recognise every joke that turns\r\nup, he has still to guard against the contributor, on whom he is to a\r\nconsiderable extent dependent. The jest-purveyor may be honest when he\r\nunwittingly sends in a joke that has already gone the rounds, and has\r\nappeared perhaps in some country paper; or he may be deliberately\r\ndishonest; or he may simply be impatient at not seeing his contribution\r\nprinted (perhaps, after all, it is only being kept back for an\r\nillustration to be drawn to accompany it), and may send it off\r\nelsewhere--anticipating its publication in the paper of his original\r\nchoice. Or a group of jokes may form the stock-in-trade of a newly\r\naccepted contributor, who, as the seaside landladies say, \"must have\r\nbrought them in his portmantel.\" And then there are recurring events\r\nthat naturally give recurring birth to jokes they almost necessarily\r\nsuggest. There is thus no standard, no system of identification for the\r\nthousand disguises in which a joke may lurk; and unconscious plagiarism\r\nand repetition deserve greater indulgence than that which they commonly\r\nreceive. Mr. Burnand, probably the most prolific punster of the age,\r\nonce wrote to a contributor, \"For goodness' sake, send no more puns;\r\n_they have all been made_!\" Indeed, _Punch_ has given us more\r\n\"pre-historic peeps\" of humour than he or Mr. Reed have any notion of.\r\n\"Bless you,\" said _Punch_ in his third number, \"half the proverbs given\r\nto Solomon are mine!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the fashion when _Punch_ was young for the comic papers to\r\nindulge in fierce recrimination and bitter charge and counter-charge of\r\nplagiarism. At that time it was thought that a satirical paper could be\r\nlaunched into public favour on its abuse of rivals--so that all the\r\ndrowning journals caught at the straws of the others' reputations.\r\nNowadays they more practically apply for an injunction. _Punch_, in\r\npoint of fact, has sought the protection of the law on more than one\r\noccasion. As early as 1844 the Vice-Chancellor's Court was the scene of\r\nthe action of the Proprietors of _Punch_ _v._ Marshall and Another, when\r\nMr. Bethell, afterwards Lord Westbury, complained that the defendants\r\nhad published a \"_Punch's_ Steamboat Companion\" (an excessively vulgar\r\nproduction) with intention to deceive the public. The judge brilliantly\r\nremarked, \"Well, this certainly is an excuse for the Court taking punch\r\nin the morning. (_Great laughter._) I think you have made out a\r\nsufficient case for your injunction, Mr. Bethell;\" and the injunction\r\nwas accordingly granted. In the following year (July, 1845) steps had to\r\nbe taken to protect Mr. and Mrs. Caudle from the wholesale piracy to\r\nwhich they were subjected on every side. Mr. Bethell again made a comic\r\nspeech, directed primarily against the \"Hereford Times\" and the\r\n\"Southport Visitor,\" in which the eighth and ninth lectures,\r\nillustrations and all, had been coolly reproduced, without a word of\r\nacknowledgment. As before, the serio-comic pleader was successful, and\r\nobtained the desired injunctions. Again, in 1872 Mr. J. C. Hotten was\r\nstopped from publishing \"The Story of the Life of Napoleon, told by the\r\nPopular Caricaturists of the Last 30 Years,\" inasmuch as the compiler\r\nhad annexed from _Punch_ all he desired for the work. (Law Reports 8,\r\nExchequer 7.) Sir Henry Hawkins was for _Punch_, and Serjeant Parry\r\ndefended. The judge, Lord Bramwell, and jury, too, believed in the\r\nsacred rights of property, and a farthing damages was awarded in\r\naddition to the forty shillings paid into Court. So _Punch_ won his case\r\nand gained his costs--and Hotten went on publishing his book just as if\r\nnothing had occurred. Another case, against the \"Ludgate Monthly,\" need\r\nonly be mentioned for the sake of a rival's remark that the idea of\r\n_Punch_ having published a joke worth copying and going to law about was\r\nthe greatest joke of all.\r\n\r\nDuring his minority _Punch_ made and sustained many an open charge of\r\nplagiarism. They were the amenities of comic literature, of which,\r\nhowever, the public soon tired; and _Punch_, recognising that newspaper\r\nreaders will not be troubled to take part or sides in an Eatanswill\r\nwarfare that does not concern them, practically dropped a campaign with\r\nwhich the rest continued to persevere. But _Punch's_ silence was\r\nmisunderstood. At any rate, it was presumed upon. When he could stand\r\nthe audacity of the poachers no longer, he broke out, as recounted, in\r\nthe summer of 1844, again in the following year, and once more in 1847,\r\ninto a practical prosecution. Douglas Jerrold's caustic pen had full\r\nplay in his all-round denunciation of the pilferers, and in _Punch's_\r\nname he let fly at big game. \"First and foremost,\" he declared, \"the\r\ngreat juggler of Printing-House Square walks in like a sheriff and takes\r\nour comic effects;\" and Newman's pencil added point to the\r\ncomprehensiveness of the assault. Of numerous frauds, too, _Punch_ had\r\nto complain. \"_Punch's_ Almanacs\" of a vile and indecent sort, with\r\nwhich he had nothing in the world to do, had been issued to his\r\ndetriment, and several papers were produced in close imitation of his\r\nown; but it was the circumstance of his stolen jokes that wounded him\r\nmost of all, and caused him to lay his bâton about him with lusty\r\nvigour. The incriminated journals, thoroughly in their element, retorted\r\nwith well-feigned indignation. Prominent among them \"Joe Miller the\r\nYounger\" had professed for him at first a particular friendship which,\r\nwhen contemptuously rejected, turned, like the love of a woman scorned,\r\nto hate. It might have been retorted that _Punch_, in the words of his\r\nprospectus, had frankly owned that he would give \"asylum for\r\nsuperannuated Joe Millers,\" and even that Mr. Birket Foster had been\r\nactually employed in 1842 in \"adapting\" and anglicising Gavarni's\r\ndrawings for _Punch's_ pages. Instead, \"Joe Miller\" defended the size of\r\nhis page, which was, he said, like _Punch's_ own, copied from the\r\n\"Athenæum,\" and protested against any attempt at monopoly, pointing out\r\nthat the sub-title \"Charivari\" was itself a plagiarism. If anyone, he\r\nwent on, could prove that he bought a _Punch_ in mistake for a \"Joe\r\nMiller,\" he would willingly pay £5 for each copy so sold, in order \"to\r\ncompensate the _Punch_ purchaser for his disappointment.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this moment until his death he never left _Punch_ alone, and\r\nconstantly pointed out many of his delinquencies, plagiarisms apparently\r\nso gross and frequent that it can hardly be doubted that some intrigue\r\nwas afoot. For example, on August 2nd, 1845, there appeared in both\r\npapers a cartoon almost identical, with the attitudes reversed, entitled\r\n\"The Political Pas de Quatre\"--after the existing ballet at Her\r\nMajesty's Theatre, danced by Grisi, Taglioni, Grahn, and\r\nCerito--representing four ballet-skirted _danseuses_ in a grotesque pose\r\nor tableau. Those in the _Punch_ cartoon (which, by the way, was\r\nsuggested at the Table by Gilbert à Beckett, and was executed by Leech)\r\nwere impersonated by Lord Brougham, Lord John Russell, Sir Robert Peel,\r\nand Daniel O'Connell; while in the other appeared Lord Brougham, the\r\nDuke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, and Daniel O'Connell; but, unless\r\ncarefully compared, the one might certainly be mistaken for the other.\r\nThe \"Joe Miller\" block was drawn by A. S. Henning, who had quitted the\r\nservice of _Punch_ three years before; and it was claimed by his paper\r\nthat the original drawing was exhibited in their window a week before\r\n_Punch's_ appeared. But abuse of _Punch_ for this and other curious\r\ncoincidences did not save him, and \"Joe Miller the Younger\" soon\r\nannounced his metamorphosis into \"Mephystopheles,\" which proved an\r\ninferior and still shorter-lived concern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARTOON ENTITLED \"THE POLITICAL PAS DE QUATRE.\"\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by A. S. Henning. From \"Joe Miller the Younger,\" 2nd August,\r\n1845._)]\r\n\r\nThen followed the bright and able little monthly \"The Man in the Moon,\"\r\nfrom which _Punch_ had some of the hardest knocks he ever received, for\r\non its Staff were to be found most of the clever men of the day\r\n(including Shirley Brooks) for whom _Punch_ could find no room. Month\r\nafter month examples were given of _Punch's_ alleged pilfering, which\r\nreally only proved how the minds of humorists run in grooves, especially\r\nwhen dealing with topical subjects; and a cutting representation of\r\nPunch as an old clo'man begging bits of comic manuscript, with the\r\nplaintive cry of \"Any Jo', Jo'--any old Jo'?\" scored a great success.\r\n\"The Man in the Moon\" chaffed Bulwer Lytton on his initials,\r\n\"E.L.B.L.B.L.B.,\" and Thackeray followed in _Punch_ with\r\n\"E.L.B.L.B.L.B.B.L.L. B.B.B.\" And one of Leech's sketches of \"The Rising\r\nGeneration\"--a small boy saying, \"Aw--hairdresser, when you've finished\r\nmy hair, just take off my beard, will you?\" (Vol. XII., p. 104,\r\n1847)--was also represented as a gross infringement. The title of a\r\npoem, \"What are the Wild Waves Saying?\" (with the reply, \"We'd better\r\nhave stayed at home\"), issued in \"The Man in the Moon,\" was seen in\r\n_Punch_ soon after; while the superiority of our \"New Street-Sweeping\r\nMachines\" over those then in use abroad (by which, of course, cannon was\r\nintended) appeared in _Punch's_ pages a fortnight afterwards. It is an\r\ninteresting fact that this self-same idea of the Street-Sweeping\r\nMachines gave Charles Keene the subject for his first _Punch_ drawing\r\njust three years later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARTOON ENTITLED \"THE POLITICAL PAS DE QUATRE.\"\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by John Leech. From \"Punch,\" 2nd August,1845._)]\r\n\r\nBut, apart from charges of direct plagiarism, \"The Man in the Moon\"\r\ncertainly anticipated _Punch_ in some of his well-known cuts. The\r\n\"Patent Railway-Director Buffer,\" which consisted in the tying of a\r\nrailway director on the front of the locomotive, was certainly the\r\n\"Moon's\" invention in February, 1847. In March, 1853, Leech showed the\r\nworld in his cartoon \"How to Ensure against Railway Accidents,\" by\r\nlashing a director across the engine _à la Mazeppa_; and as late as 1857\r\n(p. 24, Vol. XXXIII.) Sir John Tenniel showed a \"Patent Railway Safety\r\nBuffer\" precisely similar to the original device. Again, in \"The Man in\r\nthe Moon\" (January, 1848) the little joke--_Park-keeper (St. James's\r\nPark):_ \"You can't come in!\" _Boy:_ \"Vot do yer mean? Ain't it us as keeps\r\nyer?\"--is surely related to Sir John Tenniel's cut (p. 181, Vol. XXXII.,\r\n1857), in which a delightful Hodge gazes open-mouthed at the sentry at\r\nthe Horse Guards, and replies, when asked what he's staring at, \"Wy\r\nshouldn't I stare? I pays vor yer!\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Puppet Show,\" too, kept up a running fire at _Punch_, and delighted\r\nin retorting upon his charge of \"picking and stealing\" by printing their\r\njokes and his alleged belated ones in parallel columns. Among the\r\npictures, too, the \"Puppet Show\"-man was sometimes first, as in the\r\nsketch of the fat old lady who enters an omnibus and, sitting down\r\npromiscuously somewhere between two gentlemen, says, \"Don't disturb\r\nyourselves; I'll shake down\"--an idea textually repeated in _Punch_ in\r\n1864 by Mr. Fred Barnard. The \"Puppet Show\" (1848) is also to be\r\nremembered for its joke of the choleric old gentleman, indignant at the\r\ndelay of an omnibus in which he has taken his seat, crying impatiently\r\nto the conductor, \"_Is_ this omnibus going on?\" and being quietly\r\nanswered, \"No, sir; it's stopping perfectly still\"--a joke illustrated\r\nby Mr. du Maurier in _Punch_ for 1871 (p. 208, Vol. LXI.); and for the\r\npicture of the City clerk in pink, who, surprised by his employer, is\r\naccosted with the significant words, \"So that's the costume you are\r\ngoing to your uncle's funeral in?\" Charles Keene used a similar joke\r\nforty-one years later, only with time the festival had changed into that\r\nof an aunt. In the \"Showman's\" pages, too, first appeared the Frenchman\r\nwho accounts for his sore-throat by explaining that \"Yesterday morning I\r\nhave wash my neck!\" And the Duke of Wellington, in one of the cartoons\r\n(May, 1849), cries, \"Cobden, spare that tree,\" just as Beaconsfield\r\npleaded with Gladstone in Tenniel's picture of thirty years later.\r\nAgain, a man with a gorgeous black-eye enters a room, and when it is\r\nremarked on, expresses his surprise that anyone should have noticed it.\r\nSix years later Leech repeated the idea in _Punch_. In his parting shot\r\nthe \"Showman\" says, \"The _Punch_ writers say they can't understand our\r\njokes. We feel assured that the world will admit that they _take_ them\r\nfast enough\"--itself a pun, _by_ the way, which _Punch_ had himself used\r\nin the postscript to his first volume: \"Ours hasn't been a bed of\r\nroses--we've had our rivals and our troubles. We came as a great hint,\r\nand everybody took us.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"The Arrow,\" a clever fortnightly rival which existed (it cannot be\r\nsaid to have \"flourished\") in the year 1864, _Punch_ was severely\r\nhandled for \"plagiarising\" two of that journal's jokes two or three\r\nweeks after their original publication. One of these had reference to\r\nthe \"Fight with Fate,\" which was then being played at the Surrey\r\nTheatre; and as Mr. Banting and his famous cure (the stout undertaker\r\nlived but two doors from Leech, in The Terrace at Kensington, and struck\r\nup a pleasing friendship with the artist) were then the talk of the\r\ntown, \"The Arrow\" suggested a revised version, \"A Fight with Fat,\" with\r\na disciple of Mr. Banting as the chief character. _Punch_ followed suit\r\nwith the entire idea. Thereupon the rival editor, Henry S. Leigh--the\r\nlines are manifestly his--apostrophised Mr. Banting thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"Take mental exertion--fight shy of diversion\r\n    (Remember, the proverb says 'Laugh and grow fat');\r\n  You may venture securely on _Punch_, because surely\r\n    There can't be much fear of your laughing at _that_.\"\r\n\r\nAnyone who possesses the original \"Joe Miller's Jest-book\" will be able,\r\nif he cares to look, to recognise a goodly number of the most popular\r\njokes of the day, even including a number of _Punch_ jokes. He will\r\nthere find set forth in quaint terms the retort of the non-churchgoer\r\nthat if he is not a pillar of the church, he is certainly one of the\r\nbuttresses, for he stops outside--used in due time by Charles Keene; he\r\nwill find the repartee placed by _Punch_ in the drawing by the same\r\nartist (May 4th, 1872) in the mouth of an Irish beggar-woman who had\r\nbeen refused alms by a pug-nosed gentleman, \"The Lord preserve your\r\neyesight, for you've no nose to carry spectacles;\" as well as that\r\nwitticism usually ascribed to Curran when addressing a jury in the face\r\nof a dissenting judge, \"He shakes his head, but _there's nothing in\r\nit_;\" besides other favourite jokes of similar antiquity and renown.\r\nRobert Seymour, too, in whose work, strangely enough, Leech is said to\r\nhave found no humour, shines out posthumously now and again from\r\n_Punch's_ pages. \"Move on--here's threepence,\" says a butler.\r\n\"Threepence?\" retorts the street-flutist contemptuously, \"d'you think I\r\ndon't know the value of peace and quietness?\" That was originally\r\nSeymour's, together with the drawing of an Englishman's notion of \"A\r\nDay's Pleasure\"--a labouring-man dragging a cartload of children up a\r\nsteep hill on a hot Sunday--an idea which was afterwards the subject of\r\na _Punch_ cartoon.\r\n\r\nTwo jokes which from their universality of treatment and the unfailing\r\nwelcome accorded them at every reappearance might almost be considered\r\nclassic and generic jests, were greatly assisted in their popularity by\r\nSeymour's pencil, before _Punch_ obtained for them still wider\r\nrecognition. The first represents a fat man, between whose legs the dog\r\nhe is whistling to has taken his faithful stand. The old gentleman\r\nwhistles and whistles again, anxiously exclaiming, \"Wherever can that\r\ndog be?\" After Seymour had done with it, Alfred Crowquill took it up;\r\nand in 1854 (p. 71 of the second volume) Sir John Tenniel introduced it\r\ninto _Punch_ under the title of \"Where, and oh where!\" It was not yet\r\nworn out, however, though it doubtless had seen its best days; and so\r\nthe \"Fliegende Blätter\" revived it in 1894 as a typical example of\r\nrecent German humour. For the other joke two men are required: the one\r\nan unmistakable ruffian, a grim and dirty robber, and the other a weak,\r\nnervous, timid youth of insignificant stature, the scene representing\r\nthe entrance to a dark lane as night closes in. \"This is a werry lonely\r\nspot, sir,\" says Seymour's footpad; \"I wonder you ain't afeard of being\r\nrobbed!\"--and the young man's hair stands on end, and lifts his hat\r\nabove his head. Leech in 1853 (p. 100, first volume) alters the dialogue\r\nfor _Punch_ by introducing the pleasing possibility of a greater\r\ntragedy, by the footpad asking the youth to buy a razor; and Captain\r\nHoward the following spring makes the ruffian inquire if he may\r\naccompany his victim \"to hear the nightingale.\" In \"Diogenes\" (December,\r\n1854) the pristine simplicity is restored by the _naïf_ request that he\r\n\"may go a little way\" with the young gentleman; and finally, in 1857,\r\nLeech once more resurrects and renovates it with his astonishing talent\r\nand freshness for use in the Almanac.\r\n\r\n\"Are you comin' home?\" asks an indignant wife of her tipsy spouse, in\r\nMr. Phil May's admirable drawing of February 16th, 1895. \"I'll do\r\nellythik you like in reasol, M'ria (_hic_). But I won't come 'ome.\" In\r\nthe previous year, however, the following had appeared in \"Fun\":--\"_Guid\r\nWife._-'Come hame, Jock; ye'll be doing nae guid here.'\r\n_Jock._--'Onything in reason, Jenny, ma woman, but hame I wall nae\r\ngang!'\" On the other hand, in the \"Echo,\" in March, 1895, appeared the\r\nfollowing item of news:--\"There is a curious report of a dialogue in a\r\nChinese medical paper:--Doctor: 'H'm. You are run down, sir. You need an\r\nocean voyage. What is your business?' Patient: 'Second mate of the _Anna\r\nMaria_, just in from Hong Kong.'\" But more than a quarter of a century\r\nbefore, _Punch_ had treated his readers to the same.--\"Doctor Cockshure\r\n(_advising a nervous patient_): 'My good sir, what _you_ want is a\r\nthorough alteration of climate; the only thing to cure you is a long\r\nsea-voyage.' Patient: 'That's rather inconvenient. You see, I'm only\r\njust home from a sea-voyage round the world!'\"\r\n\r\nIt is amusing for one endowed with a taste for the history of humour,\r\nand gifted with the requisite memory, to follow some of these\r\ninteresting revivals or re-births of comic ideas. Sir John Tenniel's\r\nvision of \"The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street,\" in the \"Pocket Book\" of\r\n1880, was a familiar conception to those who remembered \"Cruikshank's\r\nOmnibus\" of 1841; while Leech's sea-sick Frenchman, in p. 76 of the\r\nsecond volume for 1851, was almost the counterpart of \"Glorious\r\nGeorge's\" important etching \"A very good man, no doubt, but a Bad\r\nSailor.\" Again, one of the most brilliant things that ever appeared in a\r\ncomic journal was the short dialogue supposed to pass between an\r\ninquiring child and his philosophical though impatient parent:--\r\n\r\n\"What is mind?\" \"No matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is matter?\" \"Never mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"This well-known definition,\" says Dr. Furnivall, \"according to the\r\n'Academy,' was by Professor T. Hewitt Key; he sent it to _Punch_, and of\r\ncourse it was printed forthwith--I suppose, somewhere about the\r\n'Sixties.\" But as a matter of fact this _mot_, which has also been\r\nattributed to Kenny, had already been published in \"The Month\" as early\r\nas August, 1851 (page 147, Vol. I.); and I may add that though I\r\nremember hearing Professor Key quote it more than once, I never heard\r\nhim pretend to its authorship.\r\n\r\nThen, the belated Foozle returning home drunk, and offering to fight his\r\naggressive-looking hat-stand, appeared in H. J. Byron's \"Comic News\"\r\n(October 3rd, 1863), as well as in _Punch_ by Keene's pencil (1875); and\r\nthe humorous chess-problem in the latter paper, in which White had to\r\nmate in a certain number of moves, if Black interposed no serious\r\nobstacle, was an echo of \"White to play and check if Black doesn't\r\nprevent him\" in \"The Man in the Moon\" of 1847, and of \"White to play and\r\ncheck if Black doesn't mate him before\" in \"The Month\" of October, 1851.\r\nMr. Sambourne's famous \"cartoon junior\" of Mr. Gladstone in the\r\ncharacter of the child in the soap advertisement, who \"Won't be happy\r\ntill he gets It\" (_i.e._ the cake of Home Rule, just out of his reach),\r\nwas found, to his subsequent annoyance and surprise, to have been\r\nanticipated by a week or two by the now defunct \"Funny Folks;\" and Sir\r\nJohn Tenniel's cartoon representing Mr. Goschen, then Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, as a hen sitting on her eggs--an idea which was not new even\r\nto him, as he had used it in 1880, ten years before--appeared some days\r\nafter a similar one had been issued in the \"Pall Mall Budget;\" though,\r\nof course, _Punch's_ picture had, in accordance with the mechanical\r\nroutine of the office, been decided on a week before publication.\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ advice to vocalists, \"Take care of the sense, and the sounds\r\nwill take care of themselves\" (November, 1892), had, curiously enough,\r\nbeen spoken years before by the eccentric Duchess in \"Alice in\r\nWonderland;\" and his conceit that there is no fear for the prosperity of\r\nIreland under Home Rule \"so long as her _capital's D(o)ublin'_\" dates\r\nfrom still earlier times. Then there was the fine old Scotch joke of a\r\nGlasgow baillie who, replying to the toast of the \"Law,\" remarked that\r\n\"all our greatest law-givers are dead--Moses is dead, Solon is dead,\r\nConfucius and Justinian are dead--_and I'm nae feelin' that vera weel\r\nmysel'_,\" which in March, 1893, _Punch_ republished, adapting it,\r\nhowever, to modern literature--the speaker quaintly including George\r\nEliot amongst our deceased \"best men.\" More recently a precisely\r\nparallel anecdote has been attributed to Dr. McCosh, apropos of\r\nLeibnitz's theory of evil (\"Westminster Gazette,\" January, 1895). And\r\nagain, there is an old story of Baron Rothschild, who when very busy\r\nreceived the visit of a business acquaintance. \"Take a chair,\" quoth the\r\nBaron. \"Can't,\" said his visitor, \"I'm in a hurry.\" \"Then take two\r\nchairs,\" suggested the Baron, still engrossed. In 1871 the same joke was\r\nsent in to _Punch_ in a remodelled form, and duly published. \"Call me a\r\ncab!\" says an excited gentleman. \"You're too late, sir,\" replies the\r\nservant; \"a cab couldn't do it.\" \"Confound you!\" cries the other, \"call\r\ntwo cabs, then!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1892 a catastrophe befell _Punch_, a double _faux pas_. An excellent\r\nchild story had been printed in \"Vanity Fair\" of October 15th, in which\r\na little girl at a Sunday-school class was asked to define a parable:\r\n\"Please, miss,\" replies the child, \"a parable's a 'eavenly story with no\r\nearthly meaning!\" A fortnight later _Punch_, who had been victimised,\r\nhad the misfortune, not only to come out with the same joke, but by a\r\ntypographical slip to spoil it by making the child define a parable as\r\n\"a heavenly story with an earthly meaning\"--the result being to evoke a\r\npæan of exultation from the few papers whose favourite sport it is to\r\nkeep a malevolent weather-eye on _Punch_ in perpetual hope of catching\r\nhim tripping. Just such a little chorus of mischievous delight greeted\r\nthe publication of Mr. du Maurier's joke in which an old maid complains\r\nthat a serious drawback to the charming view from her windows is the\r\ntourists bathing on the opposite shore. It is true, as her friend\r\nreminds her, that the distance is very great--\"_but with a telescope,\r\nyou know!_\" But years before, Charles Keene had illustrated the same\r\nidea, taking, however, a cricket dressing-tent instead of a bathing\r\nshore; and long before that it had been scoffed at for its antiquity.\r\n\r\nIn like fashion another _Punch_-baiter complained a quarter of a century\r\nago that an American paper printed a joke which _Punch_ duly used as a\r\n\"social,\" and which has since been revived as follows: \"Harriet Hosmer\r\ntells of an incident which occurred in her studio, where her statue of\r\nApollo rested. An old lady was being shown around, a Mrs. Raggles, and\r\nshe paused before this masterpiece a long time. Finally she exclaimed,\r\n'So that's Apoller, is it?' She was assured that it was. 'Supposed to be\r\nthe handsomest man in the world, warn't he?' The surmise was assented\r\nto. Then turning away disgustedly, 'Wal,' she said, 'I've seen Apoller\r\nand I've seen Raggles--an' I say, Give me Raggles!'\"\r\n\r\nOne of the stories told of Dominique was once printed in _Punch_ as\r\noriginal. This was when he took a bath by the doctor's order, and being\r\nasked how he felt, replied, \"Rather wet.\" The jokelet, curiously enough,\r\nhad already been printed in \"Mark Lemon's Jest-Book,\" and was so far a\r\nclassic that it is to be found in the \"Arlequina\" of 1694. Again, the\r\nstory of the boy who, when ordered by a \"swell\" to hold his horse, asked\r\nif it bit, or kicked, or took two to hold, and when reassured on each\r\npoint, replied, \"Then hold him yourself,\" is older still; for it is to\r\nbe found in \"Mery Tales, Wittie Questions and Quicke Answeres Very\r\npleasant to be Readde\" (published by H. Wilkes in 1567), under the\r\nheading, \"Of the Courtier that bad the boy holde his horse, xliii.\" This\r\nlittle book, by the way, is included in Hazlitt's collection of\r\nShakespeare's Jest-books.\r\n\r\nIn drawing attention to these incidents in _Punch's_ career--examples\r\nof which might easily be multiplied--it is not my purpose to expose\r\nshortcomings, but rather to insist on the difficulty of the humorist's\r\npath and the pitfalls that beset genuine originality. \"The late Mark\r\nLemon,\" wrote Mr. Hatton, \"had a kind of editorial instinct for an old\r\njoke. He could identify the spurious article as easily as an expert\r\ndetects counterfeit money. Lemon's soul was in _Punch_, and he had a\r\nkeen memory for every line that had appeared in its columns. He edited a\r\nbook of humorous anecdotes, but even he overlooked numerous doubles, and\r\nleft not a few errors for the detection of the critics;\" in fact, was\r\nfallible too, as in the nature of things he was bound to be. And Shirley\r\nBrooks, although with his wide knowledge of comic literature and \"happy\r\nthoughts\" he was successful too, had nevertheless humiliation to bear\r\nfor blunders not a few. Tom Taylor neither knew nor cared; as Mr.\r\nLabouchere severely said, \"he had no sense of humour,\" and the jokes had\r\nto take their chance. But to-day a careful eye is kept to this question\r\nof originality, and so far as cartoons are concerned, Sir John Tenniel\r\nhas always been trusted to see that subjects for cartoons are not used\r\nover again.\r\n\r\nAlthough _Punch_ has tripped now and again, he has been the comic quarry\r\nwhich the nation and the nation's press have worked for half a century,\r\nquoting, borrowing, stealing, a thousand times to his once. His best\r\nideas are enjoyed and used, and in due time are sent back, often quite\r\ninnocently, for re-issue. Nay, even what is popularly known in England\r\nas \"modern American humour\" has been claimed as a leaf out of _Punch's_\r\nbook, quaint exaggeration forming its staple feature, as in the case\r\nwhere we are told that \"a young artist in Picayune takes such perfect\r\nlikenesses that a lady married the portrait of her lover instead of the\r\noriginal.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, a couple of drawings by Mr. du Maurier may be referred to\r\n(second volume for 1872, and first volume for 1894), which created a\r\ngood deal of amusement at the time of their publication. In the first\r\ncase a visitor calls to inquire after the condition of a happy mother.\r\nAnd the babe, is it a boy? \"No,\" says the page. Ah! a girl. \"No,\"\r\nrepeats the lad. What is it, then? asks the startled visitor. \"If you\r\nplease,\" replies the intelligent retainer, \"the doctor said it was a\r\nHeir!\" Now, this joke almost textually reproduces a circumstance\r\nattending the birth of that Earl of Dudley of whom Rogers wrote the\r\nepigram which Byron thought \"unsurpassable\":--\r\n\r\n  \"Ward has no heart, they say; but I deny it;\r\n  He has a heart, and gets his speeches by it.\"\r\n\r\nThe second drawing reproduces a story (long since forgotten) of the\r\nfirst Duke of Wellington, who joined a notorious gambling club, with the\r\nexpress view, it was said, to black-balling his son, the Marquis of\r\nDouro, a likely candidate--and then went complacently and told him so.\r\n\r\nMuch the same difficulty attending the identification and indexing of\r\nthe jokes of the past is experienced in respect to _Punch_ itself.\r\nConsider for a moment. That work consisted in the summer of 1895 of 108\r\nvolumes. At the moderate estimate of four jokes per column, attempted\r\nand made, we reach a grand total of nearly 270,000 jokes--a total\r\nbewildering in its vastness, and representing, one would think, all the\r\nhumour that ever was produced since this melancholy world began. The\r\nmind refuses to grasp such a mass of comicality; how, then, would you\r\nclassify this prodigious joviality and sarcasm? How detect a joke that\r\nmay reappear under a hundred disguises of time, place, condition, and\r\napplication--yet the same root-joke after all? Is it surprising that the\r\nsame ideas recur--and, recurring, sometimes escape the shrewd eye of\r\n_Punch's_ investigation department?\r\n\r\nIt has already been said that to Sir John Tenniel it has fallen to\r\nprevent the repetition of subjects in respect to the cartoons. Yet it\r\nmust not be imagined that others on the Staff are not as earnest\r\nstudents of _Punch's_ pages, that they have not graduated as Masters of\r\nhis Arts. Yet, for all their vigilance, repetitions have often recurred.\r\nYou remember Tenniel's superb cartoon of the noble savage manacled with\r\nthe chains of slavery taking refuge on a British ship with clasped hands\r\nuplifted to the commander? It was at the time of Mr. Ward Hunt's\r\nslavery circular, and was entitled \"Am I not a Man and a Brother?\" A\r\nlike subject with the same title was contributed by Leech on June 1st,\r\n1844, when a manacled negro appeals to Lord Brougham, who, making \"a\r\nlong nose,\" hurries off to the Privy Council Office. Similarly have we\r\nhad two \"Vigils\"--one in the spring of 1854, and the other thirty-four\r\nyears later. And _Punch's_ exclusion from France, figuratively at Calais\r\nPier, has been the subject of two drawings--the first in 1843,[15] and\r\nthe other, by Mr. Linley Sambourne, on January 12th, 1878. The\r\nrepetitions at such long intervals lose, of course, any such\r\nsignificance as the critical might feel inclined to attribute; but in\r\n_Punch's_ nonage the self-same engravings have more than once been\r\nactually used a second time, such as \"Deaf Burke\"--the celebrated\r\nprize-fighter of Windmill Street--who was shown twice in the first\r\nvolume, certainly not for his beauty's sake; a drawing by Hine, which\r\nwas similarly employed in the same year; and in 1842 a cut by Gagniet,\r\nwhich had been bought from a French publication. Perhaps the nearest\r\nmodern approach to this was when in 1872 Mr. Sambourne practically\r\nrepeated his figure of Mr. Punch turning round from his easel to face\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the Russo-Turkish War was drawing to a close, one of\r\nthe most powerful of Tenniel's cartoons--which made a great impression\r\non the country, as giving keen point to Mr. Gladstone's agitation\r\nagainst Lord Beaconsfield's attitude at that period--was the drawing of\r\nthe Prime Minister, leaning back comfortably reading in his armchair,\r\ndeclaring that he can see nothing at all about \"Bulgarian Atrocities\" in\r\nthe Blue Books, though the background of the picture itself is all\r\nviolence and butchery. Yet nobody recalled the fact that the artist had\r\nmade a similar cartoon of Cobden and Palmerston in the spring of 1857.\r\n\r\nCharles Keene certainly had not studied his _Punch_ as he ought. Of that\r\nthere is abundant proof; for although the care he took to obtain good\r\nand original jokes was conscientious in the extreme, he over and over\r\nagain re-drew his own and other people's drolleries. The British\r\ngrumble of the British farmer who under no circumstances can be appeased\r\nor contented was typified by Leech in a picture wherein the farmer was\r\nrepresented as looking at a splendid field of heavy golden corn (p. 96,\r\nVol. XXVII, 1854), but was not satisfied even then. \"Ah!\" he grumbles,\r\n\"see what it'll cost me to get it in!\" The idea tickled Keene so greatly\r\nwhen he heard it that, entirely unmindful of Leech's page, he made a\r\ndrawing of the same subject on p. 268 of the first volume for 1878; and\r\nthen, forgetting all about it, eleven years later (p. 35 of the second\r\nvolume for 1889) he actually did it all over again!\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by coming home at this time of night?\" asks an\r\nindignant wife of her tipsy husband. \"My dear,\" replies the prodigal,\r\nwith a generous attempt at candour and conciliation, \"all other places\r\nshu'rup!\" Keene drew this admirably in 1871 (p. 71, Vol. LXI), and Mr.\r\ndu Maurier most delightfully again in 1883 (p. 14, Vol. LXXXIV.). These\r\nand many more examples of unconscious receptivity and reproduction by\r\nprofessional humorists will strike the attentive reader of _Punch's_\r\npages. He will see how to both Leech and Mr. Ralston occurred the idea\r\nof an over-dressed vulgarian in morning clothes protesting in angry\r\ndismay against the opera-house officials' suggestion that he is\r\nnot in \"full dress;\" how both Miss Georgina Bowers (1870) and\r\nMr. du Maurier were tickled by the retort to the economical dictum\r\nthat it is extravagant to have both butter and jam on a slice of\r\nbread--\"Extravagant? _Economical!_--same piece of bread does for both!\";\r\nhow \"Childe Chappie's Pilgrimage\" of our day was preceded by \"Child\r\nSnobson's Pilgrimage\" of 1842; how Mr. du Maurier in November, 1888, and\r\nagain in the Almanac for 1895 repeated the joke of a husband declaring\r\nthat he would be \"extremely annoyed\" if in the event of his death his\r\nwife did not invite certain of his particular friends to his funeral;\r\nhow Poe's \"Bells\" maintain their power to attract the parodist; how\r\ncuriously tempting to the punster is the idea of a bashful policeman in\r\nthe National Gallery being asked where \"the fine new Constable is\" (for\r\nMr. Burnand, Charles Keene, and Sir Frank Lockwood have all done it, in\r\nthe order indicated); and many other amusing slips of the sort. And he\r\nmust not on any account miss those twin jokes--for they are both of them\r\ngood and in their essence identical--of John Leech and Mr. du Maurier.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. du Maurier's version we have a poor woman touting for a bottle of\r\nwine for her sick husband. The doctor had recommended port, she\r\nsays--\"and it doesn't matter how _old_ it is, sir!\" In Leech's the host\r\nis impressing on his youthful guest that \"that wine has been in my\r\ncellar four-and-twenty years come last Christmas--four-and-twenty years,\r\nsir!\" And the guileless youth gushingly makes answer, in the belief that\r\nhe is making himself remarkably pleasant, \"Has it really, sir? _What it\r\nmust have been when it was new!_\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] Compare Shirley Brooks's couplet (1857):--\r\n\r\n  \"MARRY (AND DON'T) COME UP.\r\n\r\n  \"A fellow that's single, a fine fellow's he;\r\n  But a fellow that's married's a _felo de se_.\"\r\n\r\n[14] See _Punch_, p. 235, Vol. LXI., 1861.\r\n\r\n[15] See p. 191.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCARTOONS--CARTOONISTS AND THEIR WORK.\r\n\r\n     The Cartoon takes Shape--\"The Parish Councils\r\n     Cockatoo\"--Cartoonists and their Relative Achievements--John\r\n     Leech's First--Rapidity in Design \"General Février turned\r\n     Traitor\"--\"The United Service\"--Sir John Tenniel's Animal\r\n     Types--\"The British Lion Smells a Rat\"--The Indian Mutiny--A\r\n     Cartoon of Vengeance--_Punch_ and Cousin Jonathan--\"Ave\r\n     Cæsar!\"--The Franco-Prussian War--The Russo-Turkish War--\"The\r\n     Political 'Mrs. Gummidge'\"--\"Dropping the Pilot,\" its Origin and\r\n     Present Ownership--\"Forlorn Hope\"--\"The Old Crusaders\"--Troubles of\r\n     the Cartoonist--The Obituary Cartoon.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn describing the _Punch_ Dinner I show how the merry meeting lapses, by\r\na natural transition, from pleasure to work, and ends with the evolution\r\nof the cartoon; how the mist of talk, vague perhaps and undecided at\r\nfirst, slowly develops a bright nebulous point, round which the\r\ndiscussion revolves and revolves, until at last it takes form, slowly\r\nand carefully, though changed a dozen times, and finally, after being\r\nthreshed and threshed again, stands in the ultimate form in which next\r\nweek it meets the public eye.\r\n\r\nFor when the meal is done, and cigars and pipes are duly lighted,\r\nsubjects are deliberately proposed in half-a-dozen quarters, until quite\r\na number may be before the Staff. They are fought all round the Table,\r\nand, unless obviously and strikingly good, are probably rejected or\r\nattacked with the good-humoured ridicule and withering scorn distinctive\r\nof true friendship and cordial intimacy. Then is each fully and formally\r\ndebated, every tussle advancing it a stage, and none finally accepted\r\nuntil all the others have fallen in the battledore-and-shuttlecock\r\nprocess to which they have been subjected. Then, when the subject is\r\nsettled, comes the consideration of the details--what should the\r\ngrouping be? what the accessories? how many figures?--(during the\r\nhunting season John Leech would decline to introduce more than two, as\r\nhis week-end would otherwise be spoiled)--and other minor yet still\r\nimportant considerations; and then each man's opinion has its proper\r\nweight in the Council of _Punch_. In this year of grace Mr. Lucy is\r\nlistened to with the respect due to his extraordinary Parliamentary\r\nknowledge; Mr. Milliken is the chief literary authority since \"the\r\nProfessor\" (Percival Leigh) went to his rest; and so each man is counted\r\nupon for the special or expert knowledge he may bring to bear on the\r\nparticular subject then before the meeting.\r\n\r\nAnd when the subject of the cartoon is a political one, the debate grows\r\nhot and the fun more furious, and it usually ends by Tories and Radicals\r\naccepting a compromise--for the parties are pretty evenly balanced at\r\nthe Table; while Mr. Burnand assails both sides with perfect\r\nindifference. At last, when the intellectual tug-of-war, lasting usually\r\nfrom half-past eight for just an hour and three-quarters by the clock,\r\nis brought to a conclusion, the cartoon in all its details is discussed\r\nand determined; and then comes the fight over the title and the\r\n\"cackle,\" amid all the good-natured chaff and banter of a pack of\r\nboisterous, high-spirited schoolboys.\r\n\r\nMore than once it has happened that notwithstanding a subject being well\r\non the way to becoming a cartoon--the raw material of an idea having\r\nbeen almost hammered into a presentable political missile or social\r\ncriticism by the heads of the company--a side remark may arrest further\r\nlabour, and turn attention in an entirely different direction. Such was\r\nthe case with one of the most successful cartoons of recent years. The\r\ntopic of the week was the Parish Councils Bill, which was then before\r\nthe Lords, and was receiving severe handling in that House. In the\r\ncourse of discussion came an \"aside\" from Mr. Arthur à Beckett, to the\r\neffect that \"Gladstone is having a deuce of a time.\" \"Like the\r\ncockatoo,\" assented Mr. Lehmann, referring to the story of the unhappy\r\nbird which was left for a short while alone with a monkey, and which,\r\nwhen the owner returned to the room and found his bird clean plucked of\r\nits feathers by the monkey--all but a single plume in the tail--looked\r\nup dejectedly, and croaked in tones of almost voiceless horror, \"I've\r\nbeen having a doose of a time!\" The remarks were caught at by Mr.\r\nBurnand as a happy thought, and the new idea was tossed like a ball from\r\none to another until there issued from it the well-known design of the\r\nmonkey in its coronet, as the House of Lords, having plucked the\r\ncockatoo-Bill of most of its feather-clauses--a drawing which, under the\r\ntitle of \"The Parish Councils Cockatoo,\" hit off the situation with\r\nsingular felicity, and reaped the reward of the public applause. In a\r\nsimilar manner there developed Mr. Sambourne's peculiarly happy \"Cartoon\r\nJunior,\" representing Mr. Gladstone, newly retired, looking up from the\r\nperusal of the first speech made by Lord Rosebery on his promotion to\r\nthe Premiership--a speech some of the points of which he afterwards had\r\nto withdraw or explain away--with the words, \"Pity a Prime Minister\r\nshould be so ambiguous!\" In the arrangement of these second cartoons,\r\nwhich, as is elsewhere described, immediately follows the handing of the\r\nwritten-out subject of the main picture to Sir John Tenniel, a contrast\r\nis always the first thing sought for. If the first deals with foreign\r\npolitics, the second must treat of home matters, political or social; if\r\nthe \"senior\" is social, the \"junior\" will be political; if Sir John is\r\nrealistic, Mr. Sambourne is idealistic. And if it is impossible so to\r\ndifferentiate them, the prominent figures at least which appear in the\r\none are carefully avoided in the other.\r\n\r\nBut in the early years of _Punch_ the method was not so democratic. The\r\nmatter was discussed, but the preponderance of two or three of the Staff\r\nmade their opinions felt to such a degree that when a subject was\r\nproposed by one of them, that subject, when it appeared, was\r\nunmistakably theirs and nobody else's. I have before me the full details\r\nof these matters during a considerable period, and I find that on the\r\nwhole Douglas Jerrold was the most prolific of suggestors, while Henry\r\nMayhew (so long as he remained), Gilbert Abbot à Beckett, Mark Lemon,\r\nand Horace Mayhew, roughly speaking, divided the honours between them.\r\nThackeray seldom made a suggestion, and it is not very often that the\r\nentry \"Leech _solus_\" is credited to the great cartoonist before 1848.\r\nDuring the years 1845, 1846, and 1847, for instance, Leech alone\r\nproposed eleven subjects, Mark Lemon thirty-five, Henry Mayhew twenty,\r\nHorace Mayhew fifteen, Douglas Jerrold sixteen, Thackeray four, Tom\r\nTaylor four, Gilbert à Beckett two, and Percival Leigh two, leaving the\r\nrest to be shared by the united Staff.\r\n\r\nThe men who have borne the title of _Punch's_ Cartoonist are fifteen in\r\nnumber. Taking them in the chronological order of their first\r\ncontribution, not of drawings, but of cartoons to the paper, they are:\r\n1841, A. S. Henning, W. Newman, Brine, John Leech, and Birket Foster;\r\n1842, A. \"Crowquill,\" Kenny Meadows, H. G. Hine, and H. Heath; 1843, R.\r\nJ. Hamerton; 1844, R. Doyle; 1851, John Tenniel; 1852, W. McConnell;\r\n1864, Charles Keene; and 1884 and 1894, Linley Sambourne.[16]\r\n\r\nFrom March 4th, 1843, to September 30th, 1848 (after which, with the\r\nexception of one cartoon in 1849 from Newman, and a few from McConnell\r\nin 1852, John Leech and John Tenniel shared the cartoon-drawing\r\nabsolutely between them--no other hand making one at all for\r\nsix-and-thirty years), there appeared 314 cartoons in about 286 weeks.\r\nIt sometimes happened that _Punch_ appeared without a cartoon at all,\r\nespecially in those parlous cashless days of 1842, and again in 1846 and\r\n1848; but, on the other hand, two cartoons were frequently given in the\r\nsame number, usually from different hands, though occasionally Leech\r\nwould do both. The 314 designs were made up thus:--\r\n\r\n  J. Leech             223\r\n\r\n  R. Doyle              53\r\n\r\n  Kenny Meadows         14\r\n\r\n  R. J. Hamerton        10\r\n\r\n  H. G. Hine             8\r\n\r\n  W. Newman              6\r\n\r\n                      ----\r\n                       314 (exclusive of the Almanacs)\r\n\r\n--Hamerton having taken Hine's place, Doyle having superseded Hamerton,\r\nand Meadows, after 1844, having disappeared. Roughly speaking, from the\r\ncommencement of _Punch_ to the end of 1894, there have been 2,750\r\ncartoons in all, and these have been contributed approximately thus:\r\n\r\n  Sir John Tenniel      1,860\r\n\r\n  John Leech              720\r\n\r\n  R. Doyle                 70\r\n\r\n  Other Cartoonists       100\r\n\r\n                         ----\r\n                        2,750\r\n\r\n--representing an amount of thought and artistic achievement colossal in\r\nthe aggregate, and perfectly appalling in the case of Leech and Tenniel.\r\n\r\nDoes it not speak well for the good sense and good digestion of these\r\nmen that in all these hundreds and thousands of skits--satires going by\r\ntheir very nature into personal motives and perhaps into private\r\nactions--that the lapses and the mistakes have been nearly as rare as\r\ngreat auks' eggs? Mr. Gladstone had good reason to say, as he did one\r\nday at dinner, that \"in his early days, when an artist was engaged to\r\nproduce political satires, he nearly always descended to gross personal\r\ncaricature, and sometimes to indecency. To-day he noted in the humorous\r\npress (speaking more particularly of _Punch_) a total absence of\r\nvulgarity and a fairer treatment, which made this department of warfare\r\nalways pleasing\"--which is all very true if we admit that the function\r\nof ridicule and banter as political weapons is to be merely \"pleasing.\"\r\nAt any rate, if it be so, it is the knell of all great satire--with the\r\ncorresponding effect of making the more caustic and grosser sides of men\r\nlike Swift impossible. Yet, on the other hand, so late as 1860,\r\naccording to Sir Theodore Martin, _Punch_ more than any other paper\r\nreflected the national feeling in such matters as our naval defences; so\r\nthat in its support of Lord Lyndhurst in his patriotic agitation it\r\ngreatly assisted in strengthening the hands of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, when you know your _Punch_ as you should your Bible,\r\nto lean back in your chair and recall the most striking and important\r\namong the three thousand designs, more or less, that stand out as\r\nlandmarks in _Punch's_ pages.\r\n\r\nThe first, of course, for association's sake, is that pageful of\r\n\"Foreign Affairs\" which introduced Leech to _Punch's_ readers. It\r\nappeared in the fourth number, on August 7th, 1841. The \"Foreign\r\nAffairs\" consist chiefly of groups of foreign refugees to be seen at\r\nthat time, and even now in some measure, in the vicinity of Soho and\r\nLeicester Square--the political scum of Paris (\"Parisites,\" may they not\r\nbe called?) and of Berlin. The scroll bearing the title in the middle of\r\nthe page is fully signed, with the addition of the artist's sign-manual,\r\nwhich was afterwards to become known throughout the whole artistic and\r\nlaughter-loving world--a leech wriggling in a water-bottle. This début\r\ndid little justice to Percival Leigh's introduction, for the block was\r\ndelivered so late that, containing as it did a considerable amount of\r\nwork, it made it impossible for the engraver to finish it in time for\r\nthe ordinary publishing hour. The usual means of publication and\r\ndespatch were consequently missed, and the result was a very serious\r\nfall in that week's circulation. For some time after that Leech drew no\r\nmore, learning meanwhile the elementary lesson that large blocks take\r\nlonger to cut than small ones--or, at least, did then, before Charles\r\nWells had introduced his great invention of a block that could be taken\r\nto pieces in order that each small square might be given to different\r\nhands to engrave. Nevertheless, even to the end Leech always had a\r\ntendency to be late with his cartoons, and half Mark Lemon's time,\r\naccording to Edmund Yates and others, was passed in hansom-cabs bowling\r\naway to Notting Hill, Brunswick Square, or to Kensington, where in\r\nsuccession Leech resided.\r\n\r\nYet he could be astonishingly rapid when he liked, and often would he\r\ncomplete a cartoon on the wood while his Editor smoked a cigar at his\r\nelbow. Such a drawing--such a feat--was that remarkable block of\r\n\"L'Empire c'est la Paix\" (1859), representing Louis Napoleon as a\r\nhedgehog bristling with bayonets, admirable in expression and execution,\r\nyet not original in idea--though it is as likely as not that Leech had\r\nnever seen, or else had forgotten, the cartoon in the \"Puppet Show\"\r\n(June, 1854), wherein the Tsar Nicholas appears in a manner precisely\r\nsimilar. The Dinner had by exception been held on Thursday (March 10th,\r\n1859) instead of on the previous day; every moment was precious; and\r\nLeech proposed the idea for the cartoon, drew it in two hours, and\r\ncaught his midday train on the following day, speeding away into the\r\ncountry with John Tenniel for their usual Saturday hunt.\r\n\r\nBut in accordance with that strange law of memory that horror, ugliness,\r\nand power should spring to the mind before humour, grace, or beauty, it\r\nis the tragic side and passionate purpose of _Punch's_ career as shown\r\nin his cartoons that first arise in one's recollection. And it is (with\r\nbut one or two exceptions) exclusively in his cartoons that Leech showed\r\nhis tragic power. \"The Poor Man's Friend\" (1845), in which Death, gaunt\r\nand grisly, comes to the relief of a wretch in the very desolation of\r\nmisery and poverty, tells as much in one page as Jerrold's pen, with all\r\nits strength and intensity, could make us feel in a score. Ten years\r\nlater the same idea was splendidly developed and magnificently realised\r\nin the cartoon entitled \"General Février turned Traitor,\" which not more\r\nthan once or twice in the whole of _Punch's_ history has been surpassed\r\neither in loftiness of conception or depth of tragedy, or in the\r\ntremendous effect that immediately attended its publication throughout\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nDuring the Crimean War the winter of 1854-55 was terrible in its\r\nseverity, and the sufferings of our soldiers were appalling. The\r\nsuspense at home increased the country's emotion as to the terrors they\r\nknew of in the field. The callous statement of the Tsar, therefore,\r\nabout that time reported, that \"Russia has two generals in whom she can\r\nconfide--Generals Janvier and Février,\" struck indignation and disgust\r\ninto every British soul. On February 2nd the news arrived of the death\r\nof the Emperor. Popular excitement was intense. Consols rose 2 per\r\ncent., and the foreign market was in a state of such confusion that\r\nbrokers refused to cite even a nominal quotation. Eight days later\r\nappeared Leech's cartoon, with its double meaning of superb power,\r\nthough it was, no doubt, not the most favourable specimen of the\r\ndraughtsman's art. Received by most with wild enthusiasm, by others with\r\ncondemnation as a cruel use of a cruel fate, it none the less\r\nelectrified the country. \"Never,\" writes Mr. Frith, \"can I forget the\r\nimpression that Leech's drawing made upon me! There lay the Tsar, a\r\nnoble figure in death, as he was in life, and by his side a stronger\r\nKing than he--a bony figure, in General's uniform, snow-besprinkled,\r\nwho 'beckons him away.' Of all Leech's work, this seems to be the finest\r\nexample. Think how savage Gillray or vulgar Rowlandson would have\r\nhandled such a theme!--the Emperor would have been caricatured into a\r\nrepulsive monster, and Death would have lost his terrors.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL FEVRIER TURNED TRAITOR.\r\n\r\n(_Reduced from the Cartoon by John Leech. \"Punch\" 10th February, 1855._)]\r\n\r\nRuskin compares this cartoon for impressiveness in the perfect\r\nmanifestation of the grotesque and caricature in art with Hood's \"Song\r\nof the Shirt\" in poetry. \"The reception of the last-named wood-cut,\"\r\nsays he, \"was in several respects a curious test of modern feeling....\r\nThere are some points to be regretted in the execution of the design,\r\nbut the thought was a grand one; the memory of the word spoken and of\r\nits answer, could hardly in any more impressive way have been recorded\r\nfor the people; and I believe that to all persons accustomed to the\r\nearnest forms of art it contained a profound and touching lesson. The\r\nnotable thing was, however, that it offended persons _not_ in earnest,\r\nand was loudly cried out against by the polite journalism of Society.\r\nThis fate is, I believe, the almost inevitable one of thoroughly genuine\r\nwork in these days, whether poetry or painting; but what added to the\r\nsingularity in this case was that _coarse_ heartlessness was even more\r\noffended than polite heartlessness.\"\r\n\r\nJust before this Tenniel had given us a fine drawing of England and\r\nFrance--the new allies--as typified by two splendid specimens of Guards\r\nof both nations, standing back to back in friendly rivalry of height;\r\nand the cut achieved such popularity that, under its title of \"The\r\nUnited Service,\" it was reproduced broadcast on many articles of use,\r\nand decorated the backs of playing-cards.\r\n\r\nThe following year Sir John Tenniel (who though hardly more convincing\r\nthan Leech, yet by his power of draughtsmanship and bigness of\r\nconception could be far more imposing) produced the earliest of his\r\nmagnificent studies of what may be called his \"Animal Types\" in \"The\r\nBritish Lion Smells a Rat\" (1856). This heralded what are in some\r\nrespects his masterpieces, the Cawnpore cartoons (1857), the chief of\r\nwhich is \"The British Lion's Vengeance on the Bengal Tiger.\" Once this\r\nfine drawing is seen, of the royal beast springing on its snarling foe,\r\nwhose victims lie mangled under its paw, it can never be forgotten. It\r\nis a double-page cartoon, splendidly wrought by the artist at the\r\nsuggestion of Shirley Brooks; and while it responded and gave expression\r\nto the feelings of revenge which agitated England at the awful events\r\nthat had passed at the time of the Indian Mutiny, and served as a banner\r\nwhen they raised the cry of vengeance, it alarmed the authorities, who\r\nfeared that they would thereby be forced on a road which both policy and\r\nthe gentler dictates of civilisation forbade. Vengeance was the cry; and\r\nthe wise and humane counsels of Lord Canning met only with contempt and\r\nanger, and rendered him the most unpopular man of the day.\r\n\r\nSoon it was Tenniel's destiny to shine alone in the cartoons of _Punch_.\r\nLeech, in the last few years of his life, tired with the strain of\r\nover-work and ill-health, withdrew more and more from the making of \"big\r\ncuts,\" till towards the end they were left almost entirely in the hands\r\nof his well-loved colleague. Tenniel rose to the position and to the\r\nfull height of the great events that courted his pencil. The great\r\nAmerican struggle of North and South gave unlimited opportunity, and for\r\nfour years _Punch_, first taking sides hotly against slave-trading,\r\nbecame at times simply pedagogic in his attitude towards both the\r\ncombatants. From the time (January 26th, 1861) when there was published\r\n\"Mrs. Carolina asserting her Right to Larrup her Nigger,\" down to the\r\ncrowning cartoon of \"Habet\"--the combatants as gladiators before the\r\nenthroned and imperial negroes (\"Ave Cæsar!\")--many fine cartoons were\r\nissued; but the last-named has been held by many to be the finest that\r\nhas ever issued from the artist's pencil. But, in sentiment at least, a\r\ngreater was to come--one which helped to melt for us in a measure the\r\nhardened heart of the American nation, at that time distrustful of\r\nEngland, and righteously indignant at many a taunt that had been\r\nlaunched against her. This was the affecting picture of Britannia's\r\ntribute and _Punch's_ _amende honorable_, called simply, \"Abraham Lincoln:\r\nFoully Assassinated April 14th, 1865,\" while Shirley Brooks's verses\r\nwhich accompany them take highest rank among poetry of its kind--lines\r\nwhich, rugged perhaps in themselves, come straight from the heart, and\r\nspeak to a whole nation with true emotion and deep sincerity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"PAS DE DEUX.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Scène de Triomphe\" in the Grand Anglo-Turkish _Ballet\r\nd'Action_. (_The Finished Sketch by Sir John Tenniel for the Cartoon in\r\n\"Punch,\" 3rd August, 1878._)]\r\n\r\nThen came \"A Leap in the Dark\" (1867)--Britannia on her hunter, Dizzy,\r\n\"going blind\" through the hedge of Reform; and soon after the series on\r\nthe Franco-Prussian War and the situation that immediately preceded the\r\noutbreak of hostilities, more particularly that (proposed by Mr. du\r\nMaurier) in which the shade of the great Napoleon stands warningly in\r\nthe path of the infatuated Emperor; while those that illustrated the\r\nclose of the struggle, aroused a deeper sympathy for France than all the\r\nleading-articles and descriptive essays put together. Tenniel's\r\nhell-hounds of war, who menace the fallen figure of France distraught,\r\nare again seen in the series, almost as fine, that accompanied and\r\nfollowed the Russo-Turkish struggle. A few months later heroics were\r\nonce more set aside for humour, and the celebrated cartoon representing\r\nthe successful termination of the Berlin Treaty was given forth--\"The\r\n_Pas de Deux_\" (1878)--in which Lords Beaconsfield and Salisbury in\r\nofficial dress are executing their _pas de triomphe_ with characteristic\r\ngrace and ineffable mock-seriousness of mien.\r\n\r\nAnother cartoon that attracted general attention for its exquisite\r\nfooling, and that still haunts the mind of those who can appreciate a\r\ncompletely happy adaptation of text to subject and situation, is \"The\r\nPolitical 'Mrs. Gummidge'\" (May, 1885). Mr. Gladstone, as Mrs. Gummidge,\r\nsits in the Peggotty boathouse by the fire, on which a pot of Russian\r\nstew is simmering, while her knitting, marked \"Egypt,\" has fallen from\r\nher weary hands, and, the very picture of misery, moans out: \"I ain't\r\nwhat I could wish to be. My troubles make me contrairy. I feel my\r\ntroubles, and they make me contrairy. I make the House uncomfortable. I\r\ndon't wonder at it!!!\" To which Mr. John Peggotty-Bull, pointing with\r\nhis pipe-stem at the portrait of Beaconsfield on the wall, mutters\r\n(deeply sympathising, aside), \"She's been thinking of the old 'un!\" It\r\nwas proposed by Mr. Burnand.\r\n\r\nBut Sir John Tenniel's greatest success of all in recent\r\nyears--artistically and popularly successful--is undoubtedly the great\r\npicture illustrative of Prince Bismarck's resignation in 1889, entitled\r\n\"Dropping the Pilot.\" The subject, it may be stated, was not a\r\nsuggestion made at the Table, but it was handed in from the late\r\nGilbert Arthur à Beckett, who was too ill to attend the Dinner--(he died\r\nvery soon after)--and who thus, as so many other _Punch_ contributors\r\nhave done--Thomas Hood, Artemus Ward, Leech, Gilbert Abbott à Beckett,\r\nCharles Bennett, and others--sent in one of the most valuable of all his\r\nsuggestions just as his career was drawing to its close. The idea was\r\nimmediately accepted, and its excellence fully appreciated. It was\r\ndecided that it should occupy a double-page; and Sir John Tenniel, who\r\nhas always risen to a great occasion, did the fullest justice to the\r\nsubject. When the paper was sent round to the Staff, as it always is, on\r\nthe Monday night, they foresaw with delight that here was a great\r\n_coup_, and their conviction received ample confirmation on the\r\npublishing-day from the country at large. There was a world of pathos in\r\nthe weather-beaten old mariner who goes thoughtfully, full of doubt and\r\ncare, down the side of the ship he had originally designed and had since\r\npiloted so long and so well--now discharged as no longer wanted; and\r\nthere was a world of meaning in the ambitious and self-reliant young\r\nCommander who looks over the ship's bulwark and gazes at the bent figure\r\nof his departing counsellor. The cartoon, said Mr. Smalley, pleased\r\nequally the Emperor and the Prince, for there was that in it which both\r\nfelt and sought for. The original sketch for the drawing on the wood was\r\nfinished by the artist as a commission from Lord Rosebery, who then\r\npresented it to Prince Bismarck. In acknowledging the drawing the\r\nex-Chancellor declared, \"It is indeed a fine one!\" \"The Hidden Hand\"--a\r\ncriticism on Irish political crime and its incitement--was another of\r\nGilbert à Beckett's most striking suggestions. It appears on p. 103,\r\nVol. LXXXIV., 1883.\r\n\r\nNext I would mention--besides Mr. Sambourne's admirable Jubilee picture\r\nof \"The Mahogany Tree,\" in which the Proprietors and Staff are gathered\r\nround the Table as they toast triumphant _Punch_ (_see_\r\nFrontispiece)--another cartoon which, nobly conceived, if not quite so\r\nfine in execution, under the title of \"Forlorn Hope\" (October,\r\n1893--proposed by Mr. Milliken), has been held by some as second only to\r\n\"Dropping the Pilot.\" It is the pathetic picture of Mr. Gladstone at\r\nthe moment of his retirement leading the attack against the House of\r\nLords. A grand old fortress crowning an enormous cliff stands out\r\nstrongly in evening light against the distant sky, and the grand old\r\nwarrior, in coat of mail, is struggling up the steep and slippery\r\nside--a hopeless task, eloquent of the courage of despair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POLITICAL MRS. GUMMIDGE.\r\n\r\n(_The finished Sketch by Sir John Tenniel for the \"Punch\" Cartoon, 2nd\r\nMay, 1885. By Permission of Gilbert E. Samuel, Esq._)]\r\n\r\nLast of all upon this list, on May 15th, 1895, was the grand design,\r\nalso suggested by Mr. Milliken, entitled \"The Old Crusaders!\"--Mr.\r\nGladstone and the Duke of Argyll \"brothers-in-arms again\" in their\r\ncrusade against the Turkish persecutions in Christian Armenia--the full\r\nsignificance being insisted on by parallel dates--\"Bulgaria 1876:\r\nArmenia 1895.\" There is an air of unsurpassable dignity in the design of\r\nthe two old comrade-statesmen, mounted knights armed _cap à pie_, riding\r\nforth, representative of Christendom and the nation's conscience.\r\nImmediately on seeing the week's _Punch_ the Marquis of Lorne\r\ntelegraphed from Windsor to Sir John Tenniel, asking to be allowed to\r\nacquire the original drawing; but he had been forestalled by the other\r\nChampion's son, Mr. Henry Gladstone, who was then in town, and had\r\nsecured the prize for his family an hour or two before.\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that the _Punch_ cartoons have always been\r\nmatters, so to speak, of routine. The unexpected has more than once left\r\n_Punch_ in a terribly awkward fix. On one occasion, in 1877, it was\r\nconfidently expected that Lord Beaconsfield's Government would be thrown\r\nout on the Monday night or Tuesday morning, when, of course, it would be\r\ntoo late to begin to think of drawing and engraving a cartoon; besides,\r\nthe matter was a foregone conclusion. So Beaconsfield was represented in\r\nhis robes, leaning back \"in a heap\" upon his bench, his chin on his\r\nbreast, and his hands thrust deep into his breeches pockets, the very\r\npicture of a beaten Minister. But, as it happened, the Government was\r\n_not_ defeated--and there was the cartoon! Providentially, however, the\r\nGovernment had been severely badgered about some matter of trivial\r\nimportance, such as the amount of sealing-wax employed in Her Majesty's\r\nStationery Office, and the cartoon was used with a legend to the effect:\r\n\"After all the big things I have been in, to be pulled up for _this_!\"\r\nThe public wondered, and thought that _Punch_ had taken the situation a\r\nlittle too seriously; but it was a _pis-aller_, and the best had been\r\nmade of a shocking bad job.\r\n\r\nMr. Linley Sambourne, writing on this very matter in the \"Magazine of\r\nArt,\" tells something more of _Punch's_ tribulations: \"Difficulties in\r\nthe production of cartoons sometimes arise in the impossibilities of\r\nforetelling what, not a day only, but a week may bring forth. In\r\nDecember, 1871, when His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, to the\r\nprofound sorrow of the entire nation, hovered between life and death,\r\nTenniel drew two cartoons, to be used as events might dictate. To the\r\nintense relief and joy of all, the one that was issued was called\r\n'Suspense,' with some beautiful verses entitled 'Queen, People, and\r\nPrincess: \"Three Hearts in One\";' while the other, a grief-stricken\r\nfigure of Britannia, lay almost forgotten in the engraver's bureau, but\r\nwas remembered, and had unhappily occasion to appear thirteen years\r\nafter, on April 5th, 1884, to note the sudden loss of His Royal Highness\r\nthe Duke of Albany. _Punch_ is not infallible. The most serious slip he\r\never made in the 'cock-sure' line was a cartoon appearing on February\r\n7th, 1885, representing the lamented General Gordon shaking hands with\r\nGeneral Sir Henry Stewart (who himself lay stiff and cold after glorious\r\naction) _inside_ the fated city of Khartoum. When the number appeared\r\n(although at the moment unconfirmed), Gordon himself had been butchered\r\nby the Mahdi's fanatics; and another whole week had to elapse before it\r\ncould be corrected by a cartoon of baffled Britannia, with the heading\r\n'Too Late!' I well remember being inside a picture gallery in Bond\r\nStreet with the Editor, and hearing newsboys shouting without; the\r\nEditor turned to me and smilingly said, 'All right for our cut. There!\r\nthey're shouting \"The fall of Khartoum\"!' When we got outside, our faces\r\nfell on finding the boot was on the other leg with a vengeance.\"\r\n\r\nA more recent example of the tricks played upon _Punch_ by Fate was on\r\nAugust 11th, 1894 (p. 66, Vol. CVII.), when Sir William Harcourt was\r\nrepresented as an artilleryman mowing down the host of amendments put\r\nupon the paper against the Irish Evictions Bill with a Gatling gun\r\nlabelled \"Closure.\" Closure had, indeed, been promised, and upon that\r\nthe cartoon was based; but the Tory tactics threw out all calculations,\r\nfor the party declined to move their amendments, and took no further\r\npart in the proceedings, so that there was no question whatever of\r\nclosure. The Bill passed _en bloc_, and the Gatling remained silent.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is that class of cartoon always graceful in intention,\r\nand invariably received by the public with respect and approval--the\r\nObituary Cartoon. It was invented by _Punch_ when Wellington died. The\r\nnation was overpowered with a sense of its loss, and _Punch_, with his\r\nfinger, as ever, on the public pulse, reflected the national emotion\r\nwith a deep and noble sincerity that was gratefully felt and recognised.\r\nFrom that day onwards the great occasions of a people's loss--either of\r\nour own mourning or of our sympathy with that of others--have been\r\ntouched with a dignity and grace in accord with their lofty and solemn\r\npurpose, in drawings which have rarely failed to touch a responsive\r\nchord in the people's heart, and which, judged as compositions, have\r\noften marked the highest point to which Sir John Tenniel's art has\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] Contributed one cartoon on July 12th, 1884, and another November\r\n3rd, 1894, when the expected death of the Tsar Alexander III., on the\r\nsubject of which Sir John Tenniel's cartoon had been prepared, did not\r\noccur. \"Cartoon Junior\" was then promoted to \"Cartoon Senior.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCARTOONS AND THEIR EFFECT.\r\n\r\n     Origin and Growth of the Cartoon--Origin of its Name--Its\r\n     Reflection of Popular Opinion--Source of _Punch's_ Power--_Punch's_\r\n     Downrightness offends France--Germany--And Russia--Lord Augustus\r\n     Loftus's Fix--Lord John Russell and \"No Popery\"--Mr. Gladstone and\r\n     Professor Ruskin on _Punch's_ Cartoons--Their Effect on Mr.\r\n     Disraeli--His Advances and Magnanimity--Rough Handling of Lord\r\n     Brougham--Sir Robert Peel--Lord Palmerston's Straw--Mr. Bright's\r\n     Eye-glass--Difficulties of Portraiture--John Bull _alias_ Mark\r\n     Lemon--Sir John Tenniel's Types.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere you to ask the Editor, Staff, or Proprietors of _Punch_ whether\r\nthey regarded the political or the social section of the paper as the\r\nmore important, from the public point of view and their own, the answer\r\nwould probably be--that they could not tell you. Power and popularity,\r\neven in a newspaper--_especially_ in a newspaper--are not synonymous\r\nterms, and a great circulation does not necessarily carry influence\r\nalong with it. It may safely be taken that while the social section of\r\n_Punch_, artistic and literary combined, earned for him his vast\r\npopularity, his power, which at one time was great almost beyond present\r\nbelief, was obtained chiefly by his political satires with pen and\r\npencil. Nowadays, no doubt, their relative importance is more evenly\r\nbalanced, and what preponderating interest the cartoon may have for\r\n\"_Pater_\" is equalled by the special fascination exercised by the social\r\npicture over \"_familias_.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been the mission of _Punch_, as of many another great and\r\noriginal writer, to invent and import into the language words and\r\nexpressions which are surely destined to remain. It has already been\r\nrecorded how it was he who christened the great conservatory now at\r\nSydenham \"The Crystal Palace\"--though he was not so complimentary until\r\nhe had cultivated the personal friendship of Sir Joseph Paxton over the\r\n\"Daily News\" affair. It is he who, in his most laconic manner, has\r\ngiven his immortal counsel for all time to intending _mariés_; it is he\r\nwho has crystallised the exaggerated idea of Scottish thrift and economy\r\nin \"bang went saxpence\"--to the circumstances of all of which I have\r\nalready referred. Mr. Punch, in short, has left the English language\r\nricher than he found it, not only in word, but in idea. So, again, the\r\npresent application of the word \"cartoon\" is in reality a creation of\r\n_Punch's_.\r\n\r\nAt the birth of the modern satirical print--that is to say, in the reign\r\nof Charles I.--we see it called \"A Mad Designe;\" eighty years later,\r\nwhen George II. was King, it was known as a \"hieroglyphic;\" and then\r\nonwards, through the caustic and venomous days of the mighty Gillray and\r\nRowlandson, and even of George Cruikshank, and their contemporaries,\r\n\"caricature\" was the term applied to the separate copper-plate\r\nbroadsides that were issued, crudely coloured, from the famous shops of\r\nMrs. Humphreys, of Ackermann, of Fores, and of McLean, and displayed in\r\ntheir windows to the delight and savage applause of a laughing crowd.\r\nThen \"HB\" had followed, Dicky Doyle's clever father, whose political\r\nlithographs had begun to appear in 1830, and continued until\r\n1851--ceased, that is to say, when _Punch_ was ten years old. The wonder\r\nabout them was that, even before the days of photography, the likenesses\r\nof his subjects were so admirable, and his thrusts so happy, while his\r\nart, criticised strictly, was so very poor and amateurish. But as\r\nexaggeration found no trace in his designs, and his compositions aimed\r\nat raising little more than a suspicion of a smile in the beholder (save\r\nin the subjects of them), the word \"cartoon\" was more applicable to them\r\nthan to any that preceded or have followed them. Mr. Austin Dobson, it\r\nis true, speaks of them as \"caricatures;\" but their publisher more\r\ncorrectly defined them as \"Political Sketches.\"\r\n\r\nThen, after the little wood-cut \"caricatures\" by Robert Seymour, came\r\n_Punch_ with his full-page designs. Announced also as \"caricatures,\" for\r\na long while they were known as \"pencillings;\" but it was some time\r\nbefore they became an invariable feature of the paper. For several\r\nconsecutive weeks, indeed, in 1843 there was no full-page cut at all,\r\nuntil John Leech recommenced them with a series of \"Social Miseries,\"\r\nthe first of which represented \"Thoughts during Pastorale.\" But the most\r\nsuccessful and the best remembered was \"The Pleasures of Folding Doors\"\r\nwhen \"The Battle of Prague\" is being thumped out relentlessly on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nNow in July of 1843 the first great exhibition of cartoons for the\r\nHouses of Parliament was held. These gigantic designs handled the\r\nloftiest subjects, executed in the most elevated spirit of the highest\r\nart, with a view to ultimate execution in fresco on the walls of the\r\npalace of Westminster. It was not in nature for _Punch_ to allow so\r\nexcellent an opportunity to pass by without taking sarcastic advantage\r\nof it. He--conformably with his rôle of Sir Oracle, omniscient and\r\nomnifarious--must have his \"cartoons\" too; and so on p. 22 of the second\r\nvolume for the same year (No. 105 of the journal) he appeared with No. 1\r\nof his series. It was from Leech's pencil, entitled \"Substance and\r\nShadow,\" with the legend \"The Poor ask for Bread, and the Philanthropy\r\nof the State accords--an Exhibition.\" The cartoon represents a humble\r\ncrowd of needy visitors to the exhibition of pictures on a suggested\r\n\"free day,\" in accordance with the recommendation of the Government.\r\nThis design, a suggestion of Jerrold's, affords an excellent example of\r\nthe warm-hearted, wrong-headed sympathy with the poor which led him so\r\noften cruelly to misjudge and misrepresent the acts and lives of persons\r\nin authority whose views were not, like his own, spontaneously, kindly,\r\nand impulsively unpractical. The series of six cartoons was directed\r\nagainst abuses, the last, dealing with the subject of duelling, being\r\nentitled \"The Satisfaction of a Gentleman\"--in which two duellists\r\nappear attended by seconds wearing caps and bells, while the hangman\r\nawaits the victor in one corner, and Death digs a grave for his victim\r\nin the other.\r\n\r\nAfter this series _Punch_ for a long while dropped the word \"cartoon,\"\r\nbut the public remembered it, and has clung to it ever since. It is a\r\nremarkable thing that while the \"Encyclopædic Dictionary\" entirely\r\nignores the word in its modern application to satirical prints, Dr.\r\nMurray's monumental lexicon has as its earliest use of the word a\r\nreference made by Miss Braddon to Leech's cartoons in the year 1863--or\r\ntwenty years after it was first coined!\r\n\r\nBut the very first number of _Punch_, as we have seen, rejoiced in a\r\ncartoon as we now understand it--that is to say, a large full-page or\r\ndouble-page block of a satirical nature, usually placed in the middle\r\nopening of the paper, and for the most part still further dignified by\r\nbeing \"unbacked\" by other printing. It has been stated that Henry Mayhew\r\nat the very beginning insisted on this being a special feature of the\r\npaper, defeating the opposition of \"Daddy\" Landells, who was all for a\r\nnumber of little \"coots,\" as he pronounced them, sprinkled plentifully\r\nover the pages. But inasmuch as Landells was an engraver, who would have\r\ndelighted in the opportunity offered to his apprentices by a \"big cut,\"\r\nas he was anxious above all things to follow the Paris \"Charivari\" (the\r\nvery _raison d'être_ of which was the large political cartoon), and as,\r\nmoreover, the original \"dummy\" of the paper makes provision for such a\r\ncartoon, the statement is not to be accepted.\r\n\r\nIt was really a poor thing, that first cartoon--\"Candidates under\r\nDifferent Phases;\" but it possessed over the little \"caricatures\" by\r\nRobert Seymour in Gilbert à Beckett's \"Figaro in London,\" that had gone\r\nbefore, the important advantage of size. It was smaller than the\r\nhideously vulgar cuts in the \"Penny Satirist,\" but--in tone, at\r\nleast--this harmless satire on Parliamentary candidates displayed a\r\nrefreshing and a highly appreciated decency and moderation. And since\r\nthat time, whether satirical or frankly funny, sarcastic or witty,\r\ncompassionate or denunciatory, eulogistic, sympathetic, indignant, or\r\nmerely expository, the cartoons have rarely overstepped the boundary of\r\ngood taste, or done aught but express fearlessly, honestly, and so far\r\nas may be gracefully, the popular feeling of the moment.\r\n\r\nIt is just this happy ability of _Punch's_ to reflect the opinion of the\r\ncountry that gave it the great power it attained and won it the respect\r\nof every successive Government. It is true that of late years Mr. Punch\r\nhas rather followed public opinion than led it; and it is equally true\r\nthat he now represents a higher stratum of society than at first, when\r\nJerrold week after week pleaded the cause of the poor. Yet the\r\nGovernments of the day might have applied to him Addison's words--\r\n\r\n  \"In all thy humours, whether grave or mellow,\r\n    Thou'rt such a touchy, testy, pleasant fellow;\r\n  Hast so much wit and mirth and spleen about thee,\r\n    There is no living with thee, nor without thee\"--\r\n\r\nand esteemed themselves happy when _Punch_ smiled upon them. \"What\r\n_Punch_ says\" appears to be a good deal to the Great Ones of our world,\r\nthick-skinned though they be; for even outside politics, they have,\r\ngenerally speaking, accepted as an axiom \"Vox Punchii, vox Populi;\"\r\nwhile Cabinet Ministers, from the Premier downwards, have hoped from his\r\nbenevolence and feared from his hostility! When Mr. Mundella publicly\r\ndeclared that \"_Punch_ is almost the most dangerous antagonist that a\r\npolitician could have opposed to him--for myself I would rather have\r\n_Punch_ at my back in any political or social undertaking than half the\r\npoliticians of the House of Commons,\" he was merely expressing a\r\nconviction on the part of statesmen that many of them have given\r\nevidence of. It is another proof of the power of the caricaturist--a\r\nvery proper respect for the smile which brings popularity and for the\r\nridicule which kills.\r\n\r\nWe all know the effect of Gillray's, Rowlandson's, and George\r\nCruikshank's etching-needles upon their victims--how these latter would\r\nwrithe under a stab that was often virulent in its brutality, merciless,\r\nscurrilous, and cruel. We know how money passed--at least, in their\r\nearlier years--to influence the political opinions of the caricaturists,\r\nless in the hope of damaging \"the other side\" than with the view to\r\ndiluting with a little milk of human kindness their etchers' aquafortis;\r\nand we know how Cruikshank's sudden abandonment of political caricature\r\nhas been generally attributed (without drawing forth any denial) to a\r\nvery special communication of a remunerative sort from Windsor Castle.\r\nThat, however, was owing rather to his remorseless gibbeting of the\r\nfollies and scandals of the Court than to political attack or personal\r\npersecution; but other circumstances of a more serious, because of an\r\ninternational, character have now and again attended the publication of\r\na caricature. For example, like the Hi-Talleyrand episode, Leech's\r\nfamous cartoon of \"Cock-a-doodle-do!\" (February 13th, 1858) promised at\r\none time--less directly, it is true--to bring unpleasant consequences in\r\nits train. In the spirit of the Prince de Joinville, whose bombastic\r\nlanguage towards England in 1848 had set an example not to be resisted,\r\nwere the fire-eating words of a few French officers, who offered to\r\n\"unsheathe their swords and place them at their sovereign's disposal,\"\r\nand so forth. Leech replied with a cartoon of a Gallic cock, capped and\r\nspurred, flapping its epaulettes and crowing its loudest, while Napoleon\r\nthe Third curses the \"Crowing Colonel\" under his breath. \"_Diable!_\" he\r\nsays, \"the noisy bird will awake my neighbour;\" and the point is\r\nemphasised by a quotation from the _Moniteur_. The hit, if not quite\r\noriginal (for Doyle had made a precisely similar sketch of \"Le Coq\r\nGaulois\" twelve years before in \"The Almanac of the Month\") was, at any\r\nrate, a fair one. But some unscrupulous British patriot so took the\r\nmatter into his own scurvy hands that the following advertisement was\r\npublished in \"The Times\" of March 10th:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Fifty Pounds Reward._--It having come to the knowledge of the\r\n     Committee of the Army and Navy Club that a caricature, with most\r\n     coarse and vulgar language appended thereto, was sent to an officer\r\n     in command of a French regiment, accompanied with a forged message\r\n     from the club, the above reward will, within six weeks from this\r\n     date, be paid by the Secretary of the Club on the conviction and\r\n     punishment of the offender.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the affair was amicably settled, but not before correspondence of\r\na lively character had passed between both the insulted parties, and it\r\nwas feared that the matter might be taken up as \"an insult to the French\r\nArmy.\"\r\n\r\nMany a time has _Punch_ been excluded from France--beginning as early as\r\nFebruary 11th, 1843--by reason of his political cuts. In the first\r\nhalf-volume for that year a cartoon entitled \"_Punch_ turned out of\r\nFrance\"--showing a very sea-sick puppet received on Boulogne quay at the\r\npoint of a bayonet--first made public the severity of his struggle with\r\nLouis Philippe. There is no doubt that his denunciations approached\r\nabout as near to scurrility as ever he was guilty of; and it is equally\r\ntrue that the French King winced under the attacks made with such\r\nacerbity upon his well-known parsimony. In due time, on April 7th, the\r\nembargo was lifted, but again in the following year an article by\r\nThackeray, entitled \"A Case of Real Distress,\" in which _Punch_ offers\r\nto open a subscription for the poor beggar, with a cut by the same hand\r\nrepresenting the King as a \"Pauvre Malheureux,\" had the effect of a\r\nfresh exclusion. _Punch_ responded vigorously, his first proceeding\r\nbeing to advertise, \"Wanted--A Few Bold Smugglers\" in order that he \"may\r\ncontinue to disseminate the civilisation of his pages throughout\r\nbenighted France.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on several occasions, especially during the period of his long\r\nhostility to Napoleon III., was _Punch_ turned back from the French\r\nfrontier, though later on the authorities permitted him to enter, on the\r\ncondition that, like a Mahometan who leaves his slippers at the temple\r\ndoor, he tore out his cartoon before he passed inside. Of late years,\r\nhowever, _Punch_ has on the whole been on excellent terms with \"Mme. la\r\nRepublique,\" chiefly through his own forbearance during the period of\r\nwhat promised to be the Anglo-Congolese Difficulty. It is true that the\r\ncartoon of November, 1894, showing the French Wolf about to spring upon\r\nthe Madagascar Lamb, aroused fine indignation in Paris at this English\r\nversion of the methods of French colonial expansion; and that the famous\r\npicture of Marshal MacMahon of a score of years before, in which the\r\nPresident was shown stuck fast in the political mud, obstinately\r\nsatisfied with his impossible position (\"J'y suis!--J'y reste!\"?), gave\r\nequal offence on the boulevards; and although in the latter case the\r\nfairness of the hit was acknowledged, _Punch_ was again, as he had\r\nseveral times recently been, placed under ban. Again, at the time of the\r\nFranco-Russian _rapprochement_ and consequent _fêtes_, the drawing of\r\nthe Bear and Republic in cordial _tête-à-tête_, the former disclosing\r\nthe true source and object of his new-found affection by hinting, with a\r\nsly wink and a smirk, about a \"little loan,\" gave rise to real anger,\r\nand was deeply resented--probably with the more annoyance that the\r\ncutting truth with which _Punch_ had hit off the situation was secretly\r\nand unwillingly recognised. But save on one occasion no official\r\nexpulsion or repulse has in recent times been _Punch's_ lot. Moreover,\r\nhis splendid series of cartoons, nobly conceived and full of generous\r\nsympathy, which he published towards the close of the Franco-Prussian\r\nWar, are still remembered with some approach to gratitude in a country\r\nwhich has rarely, if ever, returned us the compliment of kindliness or\r\nfriendship, or even of courtesy, in its satiric press.\r\n\r\nEven in Germany, though _Punch_ has not often been denied admittance, he\r\nhas had at least one distinguished door closed against him. This was\r\nwhen in March, 1892 (p. 110 in the first half-yearly volume), Mr. Linley\r\nSambourne's \"cartoon junior\" was published, satirising the German\r\nEmperor in \"The Modern Alexander's Feast; or, The Power of Sound\"--\r\n\r\n  \"With ravished ears\r\n  The Monarch hears;\r\n  Assumes the god,\r\n  Affects to nod,\r\n  And seems to shake the spheres.\"\r\n\r\nThe German Army Bill agitation--the struggle between Emperor and\r\nReichstag, which was followed with so much interest in England--was then\r\nat its height; and the monarch had no mind for trivialities. _Punch's_\r\ncandour in illustrating the title given him in this country of \"The\r\nShouting Emperor,\" so it is alleged, annoyed him. \"For nearly forty\r\nyears,\" said one authority, \"_Punch_ has been regularly taken in at the\r\nPrussian royal palaces in Berlin and Potsdam. The Emperor William has\r\njust issued a private order that _Punch_ is to be struck off the list of\r\njournals which are supplied to him; and the Empress Frederick, Prince\r\nHenry of Prussia, and all the members of the Royal Family who are in the\r\nhabit of reading English journals, have been desired by their\r\naristocratic relation to discontinue the obnoxious periodical. It is\r\nunderstood at Berlin that the Emperor's wrath has been excited by some\r\njocular allusions to his Majesty's oratorical indiscretions which\r\nrecently appeared in _Punch_.\" If the members of the Imperial Family\r\nscrupulously obeyed the alleged command, they lost the enjoyment of a\r\nhearty laugh over _Punch's_ retort--for it is _Punch's_ habit always to\r\nretort in matters of this sort when his fun is misunderstood or his\r\nirony, in his opinion, taken in ill-part. This was the much-talked-of\r\n\"Wilful Wilhelm\"--representing the Emperor, _à la_ Struuwelpeter, as a\r\npassionate fractious child, screaming amid his toy soldiers and drums:\r\n\r\n  \"Take the nasty _Punch_ away;\r\n  I won't have any _Punch_ to-day.\"\r\n\r\nNor would he leave him alone for a while; but returning a year later to\r\nthe charge, and taking as a text the Emperor's words--\r\n\r\n     \"It was impossible for me to anticipate the rejection of the Army\r\n     Bills, so fully did I rely upon the patriotism of the Imperial Diet\r\n     to accept them unreservedly. A patriotic minority has been unable\r\n     to prevail against the majority.... I was compelled to resort to a\r\n     dissolution, and I look forward to the acceptance of the Bills by\r\n     the new Reichstag. Should this expectation be again disappointed, I\r\n     am determined to use every means in my power to achieve my\r\n     purpose....\"\r\n\r\n_Punch_ promptly produced his cartoon a third time, by Mr. Sambourne's\r\npencil, of \"Nana would not give me a bow-wow!--A Pretty Little Song\r\nfor Pettish Little Emperors,\" as the latest Teutonic version of the\r\nmusic-hall ditty then in vogue. And later on there was Sir John\r\nTenniel's contribution to the pretty little quarrel, in which in\r\n\"Alexander and Diogenes\" (October, 1893) the Emperor asks, \"Is there\r\nanything I can do for you? Castle? or anything of that sort?\" and\r\nBismarck Diogenes grunts his reply, \"No--only leave me to my tub!\" But\r\nthe Emperor's anger did not last long--if it ever existed at all--for it\r\nwas announced that he again received his _Punch_ regularly, but, to\r\nsave appearances, it arrived from London every week in an\r\nofficial-looking envelope, which was opened by the Kaiser's own hands,\r\nand by him duly stowed away in his library.\r\n\r\nIf _Punch_, by his outspoken criticism, has succeeded in raising the ire\r\nof two of the most civilised of the Great Powers, it was not to be\r\nexpected that he should escape the blacking-roller of the Russian censor\r\nof the press. The touchiness of that official does credit rather to his\r\nzeal than to his judgment--and, besides, he is obviously no humorist.\r\nThe Russians have had little opportunity of learning what is thought of\r\nthem and their governors at 85, Fleet Street. Time after time has the\r\ncartoon been destroyed; and Mr. Sambourne, journeying in the country,\r\nlearned by personal experience that Moscow and St. Petersburg were not\r\nas London and Paris. \"Should it happen,\" he writes, \"that any cartoon or\r\ncut at all trenched on Russian subjects, and especially his Majesty the\r\nTsar, the page was either torn out or erased in the blackest manner by\r\nthe Bear's paw. I have seen some of Mr. Tenniel's cartoons so\r\nmaltreated, and have myself been frequently honoured in the same way.\"\r\nIt is therefore rather amusing that while such drawings as Sir John\r\nTenniel produced when the great Nihilistic wave was sweeping over\r\nRussia, just before the renewed application of the repressive system\r\nduring the reign of Alexander III. and during the horrors of the Jewish\r\npersecutions, _Punch_ would appear on the Tsar's table with cartoons far\r\nmore severe and humiliating than the majority of those which appealed to\r\nthe censor's sense of despotism. Of this Lord Augustus Loftus gives a\r\nremarkable example--remarkable, too, for the Ambassador's diplomatic\r\ningenuity--his story referring to a period on the eve of the\r\nRusso-Turkish War.\r\n\r\n\"The Emperor had a favourite dog called Milord, which never left him. We\r\nwere dining at the palace, and it being a small party (there were only\r\nthe Imperial Family and Court attendants), we retired after dinner to\r\nthe Empress's private apartments. I suddenly heard the Emperor calling\r\n'Milord!' and supposed that he was calling for me; but it was his dog\r\nthat was wanted, to receive the biscuits which his Majesty was in the\r\ndaily habit of bestowing on his favourite. I immediately hastened to his\r\nMajesty, and learnt the explanation from the Emperor, who was highly\r\namused at the incident.\r\n\r\n\"At the time his Majesty was seated in an inner saloon (a sort of\r\nalcove), and placed near him was a small table, on which was a number of\r\n_Punch_, with a cartoon representing the Sovereigns of Austria, Russia,\r\nand Germany at a whist table, the Emperor of Russia holding down his\r\nhand with a card. The Emperor put the paper in my hand, and said,\r\n'_Expliquez-moi cela._' I felt the difficulty of the situation, and to\r\ncollect my thoughts asked to be permitted to study it. After a short\r\ntime I said--\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, sire, it is quite clear. The political European position is here\r\nrepresented by a whist party, and your Majesty is represented apparently\r\nas hesitating whether to continue the game.'\r\n\r\n\"It was a perplexing question, and I felt very much as Daniel may have\r\nfelt when called upon to explain 'Nebuchadnezzar's dream!'\"\r\n\r\nI was suggesting just now that to Cabinet Ministers the attitude of\r\n_Punch_ is often a matter of very real concern--at least, that they seem\r\nusually to have attached more importance to the matter than we who stand\r\noutside would think to be reasonable; though, from a proper sense of the\r\nridiculous doubtless, Ministers have rarely turned upon _Punch_ to rend\r\nhim, for all they may have suffered at his hands.\r\n\r\nThere is a pretty story of Lord John Russell that is at once a charming\r\nproof to the statesman's magnanimity and of the paper's influence. When\r\nthe excitement, already referred to, of the so-called \"Papal Aggression\"\r\nwas at its height, in consequence of the action of the Pope in creating\r\nRoman Catholic Archbishops and Bishops with English territorial titles,\r\nLord John, who was then in power, took an active part in the House of\r\nCommons on the side of the scaremongers, by introducing the\r\nEcclesiastical Titles Bill--in respect to which he was strenuously\r\nopposed by both Bright and Cobden--not in order to put repressive\r\nmeasures into force against the Catholics, he assured the House, but\r\nsimply \"to insist upon our ascendency.\" Or, as he explained in 1874,\r\n\"The object of that Bill was merely to _assert_ the supremacy of the\r\nCrown. It was never intended to prosecute. Accordingly, a very clever\r\nartist represented me, in a caricature, as a boy who had chalked up 'No\r\nPopery' upon a wall[17] and then ran away. This was a very fair joke....\r\nWhen my object had been gained, I had no objection to the repeal of the\r\nBill.\" This gave Leech his chance, and he executed his famous cartoon of\r\n'No Popery!' (March 22nd, 1851), which was among the greatest popular\r\nsuccesses ever published by _Punch_--even his smart young rival, the\r\n\"Man in the Moon,\" declaring that _Punch_ had with his cut \"wakened up\r\nthose whom his letterpress had sent to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nIn his Reminiscences the Rev. William Rogers, Rector of St. Botolph's,\r\nBishopsgate, tells the delightful sequel. When he called on Lord John,\r\nthe Minister began to talk about the Charterhouse. \"He said that he had\r\nlost his interest in the latter since his patronage had been taken away.\r\nI thought this pretty good for Whig doctrine. 'No,' he went on, 'I never\r\nabused my patronage. Do you remember a cartoon in _Punch_ where I was\r\nrepresented as a little boy writing 'No Popery' on a wall and running\r\naway?' I said that I did. 'Well,' he continued, 'that was very severe,\r\nand did my Government a great deal of harm; but I was so convinced that\r\nit was not maliciously meant that I sent for John Leech, and asked him\r\nwhat I could do for him. He said he should like a nomination for his son\r\nto Charterhouse, and I gave it him.\" This, surely, if it be true--for\r\nMr. Silver has a very different story--was a \"retort courteous\" that\r\nwould prove how deeply the cartoon went home. Were it true, it would\r\nshow how the independence of Leech could be in no wise affected--though,\r\ngoing to the House one day, he was greatly struck with the extraordinary\r\ndignity of the Minister during his speech in the great debate on foreign\r\npolicy (February 17th, 1854), when the Crimean War with Russia\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Gladstone's \"great Edinburgh speech\" of the autumn of 1893 the\r\nveteran Premier said that _Punch_, \"whenever it can, manifests the\r\nLiberal sentiments by which it was governed from the first.\" And\r\nnaturally, as a consistent Liberal supporter, it as consistently\r\nattacked the Tory party. Says Mr. Ruskin in one of his lectures on \"The\r\nArt of England:\" \"You must be clear about _Punch's_ politics. He is a\r\npolite Whig, with a sentimental respect for the Crown, and a practical\r\nrespect for property. He steadily flatters Lord Palmerston, from his\r\nheart adores Mr. Gladstone. Steadily, but not virulently, caricatures\r\nMr. D'Israeli; violently and virulently castigates assault upon property\r\nin any kind, and holds up for the general idea of perfection, to be\r\naimed at by all the children of heaven and earth, the British Hunting\r\nSquire, the British Colonel, and the British sailor.\"\r\n\r\nThis persistent opposition to Disraeli throughout his whole career--an\r\nhostility more bitter than perhaps might have been expected from\r\nRuskin's \"polite Whig\"--was esteemed at its full importance by the\r\nobject of it, though it was accepted by him, as similar attacks are\r\naccepted by all great minds, in excellent part. Nevertheless, after only\r\nthree or four years of attack, he made a determined though unsuccessful\r\nattempt to conciliate his pungent critic. Vizetelly, in his \"Glances\r\nBack through Seventy Years,\" tells the story with all the interest\r\nbelonging to a personal recollection.\r\n\r\n\"In the summer of 1845,\" he says, \"Mr. Disraeli took the chair at the\r\nannual dinner of the 'Printers' Pension Society,' when the stewards, of\r\nwhom I was one, received him in the drawing-room of the 'Albion,' in\r\nAldersgate Street. Immediately after his entrance he posted himself in a\r\nnonchalant fashion with his back to the mantelpiece, and his thumbs in\r\nhis waistcoat pockets, an attitude Thackeray was fond of assuming, and\r\nbegan to chat familiarly with those near him. In a minute or two he\r\nasked if Mr. Leech was present (Leech was one of the stewards), as if he\r\nwould like to make his acquaintance. The famous _Punch_ caricaturist\r\nthereupon stepped forward, and was duly introduced. Disraeli showed\r\nhimself particularly gracious, and warmly congratulated the artist,\r\nwhose pencil had lately been employed in satirising him in a\r\ndisparaging fashion, depicting him as a nice young man for a small\r\nparty, _i.e._ the Young England party, as a Jew dealer in cast-off\r\nnotions, and as a young Gulliver before the Brobdingnag Minister (Sir R.\r\nPeel). Disraeli tried his hardest to ingratiate himself with the\r\ndistinguished caricaturist, but Leech, proof against the wiles of the\r\ncharmer, rejoined some months afterwards with the famous cartoon wherein\r\nDisraeli, who had lately proclaimed that, although the cause was lost,\r\nthere should be some retribution for those who betrayed it, figured as a\r\nspiteful ringletted viper, and Peel as a smiling unconcerned old file.\r\n\r\n\"During the dinner the chairman did his best to make himself pleasant,\r\nand hobbed and nobbed unreservedly with his immediate neighbours....\r\nWhen the toasts had been drunk and the secretary had read out the list\r\nof subscriptions and the quiet family-men had hurried off to catch the\r\nlast suburban omnibus, Mr. Disraeli showed no disposition to vacate the\r\nchair. Seeing this, the remaining guests drew up to his end of the\r\ntable, and a lively discourse ensued, in which a casual allusion to\r\n_Punch_ was made. Disraeli profited by this by rising to his feet, and\r\nin a clever and amusing speech proposed the health of Mr. Punch, towards\r\nwhom, he protested, he felt no kind of malice on account of any\r\nstrictures, pictorial or verbal, which that individual might have passed\r\nupon him. Everybody entered into the spirit of the joke, and after the\r\ntoasts had been drunk, calls were made indifferently upon Lemon and à\r\nBeckett, both of whom were present, to respond. Mark, however, rose, and\r\nin a brief and witty speech returned thanks for the honour that had been\r\ndone, as he neatly put it, to an absent friend.\r\n\r\n\"Disraeli's amiable advances availed him nothing. For a long time\r\nafterwards _Punch_ gave no quarter to the 'Red Indian of debate' who, as\r\nSir James Graham pithily phrased it, 'cut his way to power with a\r\ntomahawk.' The time came, however, when Disraeli could show his\r\nmagnanimity. Leech, who had satirised him weekly, and so familiarised\r\neveryone with his face and figure that an aristocratic little damsel, on\r\nbeing presented to him, exclaimed, 'I know you! I've seen you in\r\n_Punch_!'--Leech had had a pension given to him by the Liberals, and\r\nwhen he died the pension would have died with him, had not Disraeli, who\r\nhad at last risen to power, interposed and secured it to the family.\"\r\nAnd so Leech, who apparently _could not_ make an enemy, was indebted to\r\nthe generosity of his victims for two of the greatest services that were\r\nrendered to him and his.\r\n\r\nLord Beaconsfield himself acknowledged in his latest book, \"Endymion,\"\r\nhis respect for _Punch's_ influence at that time, as well as his desire\r\nto temper the ardour of its attacks if not to secure its silence, for he\r\nthere explains how the hero, who to some degree at least is to be\r\nconsidered an autobiographical study, \"flattered himself that\r\n'Scaramouche'\" would regard him in a more friendly spirit. _Punch_, with\r\npardonable pride, devoted a cartoon to this pointed reference, but\r\nmerely remarking, \"H'm--he _did_ flatter himself,\" abated not one jot of\r\nhis caustic criticism.\r\n\r\nBut for all the failure of his advances, and for all his\r\nsensitiveness--so far as he could be said to be sensitive at\r\nall--Beaconsfield kept a close eye on _Punch_, and kept many, if not\r\nall, of the cartoons in which he figured. Similarly did Napoleon III.\r\nlove to collect all those of himself which he could obtain, and pore\r\nover them at intervals, even in those sadly fallen times he spent at\r\nChislehurst. And he had material for reflection enough, for in no way, I\r\ntake it, can a public man learn what a world of savagery, hatred,\r\ncruelty, and uncharitableness lies, not so much in man's mind, but in\r\nthat corner of it which we euphemistically term his \"humour,\" as in\r\nfollowing the handiwork of the political caricaturist of France. Mr.\r\nSpurgeon, too, used to keep all the cartoons and caricatures that sought\r\nto turn him to ridicule; and Lord Beaconsfield, like the Prince Consort,\r\nLord Randolph Churchill (who possessed several of the original _Punch_\r\ndrawings into which he had been introduced), among other politicians of\r\nthe day, kept these artistic instruments of political torture before\r\nhim, as a man treasures in his locket the hair of the dog that bit him.\r\nA visitor to Hughenden gave, in the \"Dublin Mail,\" an interesting\r\nillustration of this tribute to the comic press. He was waiting in an\r\nante-chamber, \"and while passing the time my attention was attracted to\r\na clever sketch of the then Prime Minister, depicted as Hamlet, seated\r\nat a table covered with innumerable documents, the text quotation being,\r\n'The time is out of joint. O Cursed spite, That [ever] I was born to set\r\nit right!' I was smiling at the picture, which, I may add, was a cut out\r\nof _Punch_, and framed, when the Prime Minister entered with the\r\ngentleman who was to present me, and finding me gazing at the sketch\r\nLord Beaconsfield said, 'Yes, that is one of the best caricatures of me\r\nthat has yet appeared, and, strange to say, the artist has neither\r\npresented me with donkey's ears nor cloven hoofs. I feel very much\r\nflattered!' Lord Beaconsfield took an interest in all the caricatures\r\nthat appeared of him, and at the time he died he had several hundreds in\r\nhis possession.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, who, we have often been assured, has not the gift of\r\nhumour, has at least enjoyed _Punch's_ good-natured yet occasionally\r\nsevere raillery, and in the same Edinburgh speech to which reference has\r\nalready been made, he recalled with much relish how, in connection with\r\nthe rejection of the Paper Duty Bill, he was represented in a cartoon as\r\nbeing decorated by the triumphant Lord Derby--the Lord Derby of that\r\nday, who led the House of Lords--with an immense sheet of paper made\r\ninto a fool's-cap, which he dropped upon his head. Mr. Goschen took a\r\nstill more exalted view of _Punch's_ prestige when he declared (at\r\nRugby, November, 1881) that \"he had since attained to the highest\r\nambition which a statesman can reach--namely, to have a cartoon in\r\n_Punch_ all to himself.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD BEACONSFIELD IN \"PUNCH.\"\r\n\r\n_By R. Doyle, J. Leech, J. Tenniel, C. Keene, L. Sambourne, and H.\r\nFurniss. (Re-drawn by Harry Furniss.)_]\r\n\r\nBut hardly less important, in many a public man's opinion, than the\r\nsardonic significance of _Punch's_ treatment of him in the cartoon, is\r\nthe degree of facial resemblance achieved by the artist. It is\r\nundeniable that a likeness which is only half a likeness will often rob\r\nan otherwise admirable cartoon of half its success, just as it was\r\noftentimes the excellence of the portraiture which more than\r\ncounterbalanced the weakness of HB's sketches. Lord Brougham always\r\nflattered himself that _Punch's_ portraits of him did not do him\r\njustice, and John Forster, in his \"Life of Dickens,\" bears witness to\r\nit. \"Lord Carlisle repeated what the good old Brougham had said to him\r\nof 'those _Punch_ people,' expressing what was really his fixed belief,\r\n'They never get my face, and are obliged to put up with my plaid\r\ntrousers.'\" But another writer, on the contrary, states that Lord\r\nBrougham \"himself admits that the _Punch_ likenesses are the best. Of\r\ncourse, they are a little exaggerated, but not so much so as many with\r\nwhom I have chatted on the subject are apt to suppose;\" while Motley,\r\nthe American Minister, declared, after an official meeting with the grim\r\nold lord, \"He is exactly like the pictures in _Punch_, only _Punch_\r\nflatters him. The common pictures of Palmerston and Lord John Russell\r\nare not at all like, to my mind; but Brougham is always hit exactly.\"\r\nLeech, indeed, enjoyed nothing more than caricaturing him, one of the\r\nmost precious butts _Punch_ ever took to himself, until he was twitted\r\nin the \"Puppet-Show\" at the liberties he took: \"The proprietors will be\r\ncompelled to widen the columns of their journal ... to show, as far as\r\nspace will admit, to what lengths a nose may go in the hands of an\r\nunprincipled illustrator.\" But it was not only that _Punch_ delighted in\r\ntoying with Lord Brougham's cantankerousness and his peculiarities of\r\nmanner and diction--as in the famous cartoon of Lord Brougham as Mrs.\r\nCaudle, of the original sketch for which a reproduction is given\r\nopposite--but he steadily carried into execution his threat of earlier\r\ndays, to drag Lord Brougham \"in the mire.\" He has been as good as his\r\nword ever since the day when Dicky Doyle drew the famous cover which is\r\nfamiliar to us all--that is to say, in 1849--for, as you will see if you\r\nwill refer to last week's _Punch_, a young faun in the grand procession\r\nthat appears as a _relievo_ upon the podium or base draws along the mask\r\nof Brougham by a string. But without doubt one of the most successful\r\ncartoons Leech ever drew, and the most humorous portrait of Brougham,\r\nrepresented him as a clown at Astley's, going up to the splendid\r\nring-master, the Duke of Wellington (as Mr. Widdicomb of Astley's\r\nAmphitheatre) and saying \"Well, Mr. Wellington, is there anything I can\r\ndo for you--for to run, for to fetch, for to carry, for to borrow, for\r\nto steal?\" As Lord Brougham was suspected of undue complaisance towards\r\nthe Duke at the time, the neatness of the political allusion was\r\nreceived with extraordinary favour by the public.\r\n\r\nAnother admirable portrait, consistently good, was that of Sir Robert\r\nPeel: so good, indeed, that when it was proposed to erect a statue to\r\nthe statesman, and the best of all likenesses was sought as a guide to\r\nthe sculptor--a resemblance truthful in feature and natural\r\nexpression--the choice fell on a cartoon by Leech, and according to that\r\ndrawing the head was modelled. Palmerston, too, was not a little\r\nimpressed when in Wales a postman spoke to him as though he knew him,\r\nand replied, when questioned as to the recognition, \"Seen your picture\r\nin _Punch_, my lord.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE MRS. CAUDLE OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say? _Thank heaven! You are going to enjoy the recess--and\r\nyou'll be rid of me for some months?_ Never mind. Depend upon it, when\r\nyou come back, you shall have it again.

It was his\r\ncommon practice to put a straw into Lord Palmerston's mouth. Palmerston,\r\nof course, never did chew straws; but one was adopted as a symbol to\r\nshow his cool and sportive nature. Many a time has that straw formed\r\nthe topic of serious discussion by serious writers. Some have pretended\r\nthat it was designed to typify an expression used by one of his admiring\r\nfollowers in the House--a tribute to his \"stable character;\" others have\r\nsaid that it became his attribute from the time that he described\r\nhimself as \"playing the part of judicious Bottle-Holder to the\r\npugnacious Powers of Europe;\" and Mark Lemon declared that it was simply\r\nused as a sort of trade-mark whereby he might be known again, just as\r\nMr. Harry Furniss invented Mr. Gladstone's collars, Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill's diminutiveness, and exaggerated those complacent smiles and\r\noily rippling chins of Sir William Harcourt, continuing them long after\r\nthe time when Sir William could boast the local portliness no more.\r\nHowever, it is certain that the sprig of straw, which really referred\r\nonly to his pure devotion to the Turf, from 1815 onwards, was first used\r\nin 1851, just after the whimsical \"Judicious Bottle-Holder\" declaration,\r\nand, as a matter of fact, added not a little to Palmerston's popularity,\r\nas not only representing the Turf, but a Sam Weller-like calmness,\r\nalertness, and good-humour.\r\n\r\nSimilarly both Leech and Tenniel were in the habit of giving Bright an\r\neye-glass. \"Some of us remember seeing him wear a coat with a stand-up\r\ncollar in the House of Commons,\" said a writer in the \"Daily Telegraph,\"\r\n\"and a broad-brimmed hat; but 'why,' he used to ask with a merry face,\r\n'did _Punch_ always put an eye-glass in _my_ eye? I never wore a single\r\neye-glass!'\" That was just the point; for no doubt the simple reason was\r\nthat the addition of a monocle was supposed to lend a sort of rakish\r\nappearance to the solemn Quaker, and belonged to the same genus of\r\nperverse jocularity as that which suggested three hats as the humorous\r\ncovering for young Disraeli's head. Mr. W. H. Smith in like manner\r\ngenially protested at a complimentary dinner in 1877 against the\r\nliberties taken with his person. \"As to _Punch_,\" he said, \"whose\r\nremarks have been mentioned, I beg leave to say that I do not go to sea\r\nin uniform, or exhibit those very queer expressions of face depicted by\r\n_Punch's_ artists.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some men whose physiognomies defy the deftest pencils. Such a\r\none was Cobden, whose views _Punch_ represented far more faithfully and\r\nsympathetically than his face. At the Cobden dinner of 1884 Lord\r\nCarlingford drew fresh attention to the point: \"Cobden's was, for some\r\nreason which I never heard explained, a most difficult face to sketch,\r\nand _Punch_ was in despair at the impossibility of producing a\r\ncaricature that could be recognised without explanatory text. Many of\r\nthe artists tried Cobden, and were floored over him. Leech and Tenniel\r\nboth confessed that they could not hit the familiar expression. Somehow,\r\nthey never did hit it, though photography came by-and-by to their aid.\"\r\nThe statement is perfectly true, but the reason is not hard to find:\r\nsimply that a shaven face, without well-marked features or strong lines\r\nof character, and, above all, without angularities, gives the artist\r\nextremely little to \"take hold of.\" For that reason such faces as those\r\nof Lord Rosebery, Mr. Asquith, and Mr. John Morley (of the latter of\r\nwhom Mr. Furniss used to say the true characteristic expression is only\r\nto be found in his red cravat) are as often failures as successes, in\r\neven the skilfullest hands. It is the fault of neither the artist nor\r\nthe person misrepresented; according to Mr. Lucy--it is \"the act of\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the days of photography the work of the caricaturist was harder\r\nthan it is now. Draughtsmen had to be familiar with the faces of the\r\nleading men of the day--even as Leech was, by \"getting them\" into their\r\nsketch-books by hook or by crook, or else they would accept the portrait\r\nalready published by a brother-artist. Even to-day it sometimes occurs\r\nthat a man of importance has not been photographed. In that case he must\r\nbe sketched or remembered, or his portrait \"faked up\" on the block until\r\nit bears some resemblance to the person required. But, passing from mere\r\nportraiture to the realisation of ideas, the artist feels his liberty,\r\nand gives his genius full rein. Thus it is that _Punch_ has always been\r\nhappy and successful in his \"types.\" It is thoroughly in the spirit of\r\ncaricature that types should be established and adhered to in order to\r\nexpress, in symbolic form, nations and even ideas. Not only is it\r\npoetical, it is convenient; and has perforce been adopted in every\r\ncountry where political caricature is employed, though with standards\r\nand notions very different from our own. In Italy, for example, and in a\r\nminor degree in Germany, John Bull, as the symbol of Great Britain, is\r\nusually represented by a travesty of _Punch's_, with a brutal head and\r\nbandy legs, and the whole figure bent in body to suggest a bull, horns\r\nsometimes protruding beside the hat; while Russia is courteously\r\nrepresented as a frantic Cossack of terrific mien, brandishing a knout\r\nwith violent and savage intent. We may claim that our types, as invented\r\nby _Punch_, are of immeasurable superiority, whether of conception or of\r\nrealisation. Our John Bull--a lineal descendant probably of Gillray's\r\nfavourite representation of George the Third as \"Farmer Gearge\"--is a\r\nfine noble fellow enough as drawn by Leech and developed by Tenniel;\r\nindeed, in the drawings of the latter may often be seen the idealised\r\nface of Mark Lemon, his jovial Editor.\r\n\r\nThis view of the type of England has attracted the attention of Ruskin.\r\n\"Is it not surely,\" he asks, \"some overruling power in the nature of\r\nthings, quite other than the desire of his readers, which compels Mr.\r\nPunch, when the squire, the colonel, and the admiral are to be at once\r\nexpressed, together with all that they legislate or fight for, in the\r\nsymbolic figure of the nation, to present the incarnate Mr. Bull always\r\nas a farmer--never as a manufacturer or shopkeeper--and to conceive and\r\nexhibit him rather as paymaster for the faults of his neighbours than as\r\nwatching for opportunity of gain out of their follies?\" And again,\r\n\"... considering _Punch_ as the expression of the popular voice, which he\r\nvirtually is, and even somewhat obsequiously, is it not wonderful that\r\nhe has never a word to say for the British manufacturer, and that the\r\ntrue citizen of his own city is represented by him only under the types\r\neither of Sir Pompey Bedell or of the more tranquil magnate and\r\npotentate, the bulwark of British constitutional principles and\r\ninitiator of British private enterprise, Mr. John Smith?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. GLADSTONE IN \"PUNCH.\"\r\n\r\n_(By J. Leech, J. Tenniel, L. Sambourne, and H. Furniss. Re-drawn by\r\nHarry Furniss.)_]\r\n\r\nIt is true that _Punch_ has imposed upon a nation a character which, as\r\ndepicted, is unknown in the land, and placed him in a line of business\r\nnotoriously dissimilar from that in which he really engages; and the\r\nsum-total of it all is greatly to the credit of Mr. Punch's influence.\r\nHe has, in fact, \"educated\" a nation. For to this day, no sooner does\r\neach succeeding Wednesday spread the new issue over the country than a\r\nmass of newspapers, both in England and in the colonies, immediately\r\ndescribe and discuss \"This week's cartoon\" for the edification of their\r\nreaders. And so we have come to accept these types until they have\r\nalmost grown into concrete ideas--conventions which have been given to\r\nus chiefly by Sir John Tenniel--Britannia and Father Time, the New Year\r\nand the Old, Cousin Jonathan (or Uncle Sam) and Columbia, Death and\r\nCrime, Starvation and Disease, Peace and War, Justice and Anarchy, the\r\nBritish Lion (might not the symbol nowadays be more appropriately the\r\nBritish Racehorse?), the Bengal Tiger, the Russian Bear, the Eagle, and\r\nall the rest. And could they well be bettered?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] it was on Cardinal Wiseman's door, not upon a wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n_PUNCH_ ON THE WAR-PATH: ATTACK.\r\n\r\n     _Punch_ lays about Him--Assaults the \"Morning Post\"--The Factitious\r\n     \"Jenkins\"--Thackeray's Farewell--Mrs. Gamp (the \"Morning Herald\")\r\n     and Mrs. Harris (the \"Standard\")--_Lèse Majesté!_--The \"Standard\"\r\n     Fulminates a Leader--The Retort--His Loyalty--Banters the Prince\r\n     Consort--Tribute on the Prince's Death--_Punch's_ Butts: Lord\r\n     William Lennox--Jullien--Sir Peter Laurie--Harrison\r\n     Ainsworth--Lytton--Turner--A Fallacy of Hope--Burne-Jones--Charles\r\n     Kean--S.

In these more sophisticated\r\ndays it is the usual aim of every prominent journal to ignore as far as\r\npossible the existence of its rivals; then, it was thought that that\r\nexistence could be best undermined, if not absolutely cut short, by\r\ndirect attack. Party spirit ran very high; and to _Punch's_ undoubted\r\nstrengthen serious writing was added a power of pungent wit and sarcasm\r\nunequalled by any rival. He thus became a very formidable adversary; and\r\nhe knew it. But he did not put forth his full strength until he felt\r\nsure of his own firm establishment; nor did he turn his _bâton_ upon his\r\nbrothers in the press until he had made a lively start upon individual\r\nstatesmen and private persons, and formally set them up as his own\r\nparticular Aunt Sallies for private and public practice.\r\n\r\nHis first onslaught on the daily press was made upon the \"Morning Post\"\r\n(p. 126, Vol. IV.), by the hand, not of Thackeray, as has hitherto been\r\nbelieved, but of Douglas Jerrold, under the title of \"The 'Post' at the\r\nOpera.\" The tone of that newspaper was irresistible to the democrats of\r\n_Punch_; and Thackeray, Leech, and à Beckett took up the running with\r\ngreat glee. Jerrold and Thackeray chose to personify the paper by the\r\ncreation of \"Jenkins,\" and the \"Jenkins Papers\" soon became a recognised\r\nfeature and one of the standard jokes of the paper. Leech's\r\nillustrations were every bit as good as the others' text; and even when\r\nthe gentle Hine was called upon to make sketches upon the same subject,\r\nhe found himself inspired like the rest. \"Jenkins,\" the toady, and\r\n\"Lickspittleoff,\" his \"Russian editor,\" were grand sport in the office,\r\nand their example was followed--not a little to their disgust--by the\r\n\"Great Gun\" and other papers. Soon after his first introduction (p. 123,\r\nVol. V.) \"Jenkins\" was cast aside as a joke played out, and Thackeray\r\ntook leave of him in the following amazing lines:--\r\n\r\n\"PUNCH'S PARTING TRIBUTE.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Oh! Jenkins, homme du peuple--mangez bien![18]\r\n  Désormais avec toi nous ferons rien,\r\n  Vous êtes tout usé--chose qui montre la corde,[19]\r\n  Nos lecteurs étaient mal de toi d'abord;\r\n  Allez-vous-en--votre bâton coupez vite,\r\n  En _Ponch_ jamais votre nom--désormais sera dite.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the possibilities of \"Jenkins\" were fully realised, he was\r\nrevived, and for some years did excellent service as a subject for\r\nhumorous attack.\r\n\r\nA more serious campaign upon which _Punch_ now entered was that against\r\nthe \"Standard\" and the \"Morning Herald.\" He had with some astuteness,\r\nand doubtless not without sincerity, ranged himself on the side of the\r\n\"Times,\" and threw himself into the fray with all the zest and some of\r\nthe irresponsibility of the licensed jester.[20] \"Martin Chuzzlewit\"\r\nhad already seized upon the town, and the names of Mrs. Gamp and Mrs.\r\nHarris were on everybody's lips. _Punch_ chose to assume that the\r\n\"Morning Herald\" and the \"Standard\"--morning and evening papers then\r\nwhich represented the Conservative party, both of them until 1857\r\nbelonging to one proprietor--were edited respectively by the two ladies\r\naforesaid. The \"Standard\" was very wroth. It would not have been so sore\r\nperhaps at being dubbed \"Betsy Prig;\" but, being in fact almost a\r\nreprint of the \"Herald,\" the suggestion of \"Mrs. Harris\"--a creature of\r\nno existence, the mere reflex of Mrs. Gamp's own inane and besodden\r\nbrain--was too calmly provoking, as it was meant to be, to be borne in\r\nsilence. These two journals were highly unpopular at the time; for the\r\n\"Manchester School\" was making headway, and Free Trade was already a\r\npowerful and significant cry. So when _Punch_ laughed at them for\r\ntwo--though really one--disreputable old women, and Leech's inimitable\r\npencil typified them as such, in mob-cap and pattens, the public laughed\r\nwith him, whatever their own political opinion might be. It should be\r\nnoted, however, that _Punch's_ first brush with the \"Herald\" was\r\npersonal, not political. In February, 1843, the latter journal had\r\nfathered upon _Punch_ a poor joke of which he was entirely innocent, and\r\nwhich he repudiated in an article entitled \"Impudent Attempt at Fraud.\"\r\nThe quarrel thus begun in fun was continued in earnest, and soon the\r\n\"Herald,\" as a representative of public opinion, had no more damaging\r\nassailant than \"our humorous contemporary.\"\r\n\r\nNow, in November, 1845, there appeared a reference to \"Mrs. Harris,\r\nEditress of the Standard,\" as well as a drawing by Leech, called\r\n\"Maternal Solicitude,\" which was intended to satirise the snobbery of\r\npersons who name their children after the Royal Family. It represents\r\nthe visit of one lady to another, while a pair of repulsive-looking\r\nbrats of one of them make up the group. \"And the dear children?\" asks\r\nthe friend. \"Why,\" replies the fond mother, \"Alexandrina Victoria is a\r\ngood deal better; but dear little Albert here is still very delicate.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon the \"Standard\" opened the floodgates of its anger in a leading\r\narticle, the whole tone of which is a curious contrast to its dignity\r\nand moderation at the present day. In the course of its outburst it\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n     Still not one word from the \"Times\" in support of its charge of the\r\n     exercise of Court influence at the Windsor Election. As usual,\r\n     however, ... its _toadies_ are active and noisy.... To-day we, of\r\n     course, find _Punch_ the most abject, probably, of all the \"Times\"\r\n     _toadies_, discharging the duties of its mean avocation in an\r\n     article libelling the successful candidate, libelling the military,\r\n     libelling the young gentlemen of Eton, and ascribing Colonel Reid's\r\n     return to \"kitchen-stairs influence\" emanating from the Castle.....\r\n     If there were any fun in the article to which we refer, we might\r\n     forgive the malice and falsehood, as we are all too much disposed\r\n     to do, for the joke's sake; but dull as all the articles of _Punch_\r\n     have been lately growing, this article on the Windsor Election is\r\n     the stupidest that we have seen in its columns--a mere display of\r\n     heavy spitefulness. We should probably have overlooked this piece\r\n     of impertinence had _Punch_ confined itself to letterpress in its\r\n     _toady_ vindication of the quarrel of the \"Times;\" but in the 222nd\r\n     page of the number which contains the Windsor Election article,\r\n     there is a disgusting caricature of the Queen and her family, the\r\n     most false and unjust in what it implies that it is possible to\r\n     conceive, and the most offensive to the feelings of a mother. The\r\n     effect of such an insult to a Sovereign the object of her people's\r\n     respect and love will, we imagine, be different from what the\r\n     \"Times\" and its _toadies_ anticipate. At all events, such insults\r\n     will not, in the absence of all proof, render credible the false\r\n     allegation of the exercise of Court influence, or enable the\r\n     \"Times\" to get rid of our challenge, which we again repeat--this is\r\n     a point from which we shall not be driven, until we have a direct\r\n     answer from the \"Times\" itself, not from its _toadies_. The Queen\r\n     may be libelled as the _Punch_, \"Times,\" and \"Examiner\" libel her\r\n     Majesty, if Sir Frederick Thesiger permit; but our Sovereign shall\r\n     not be belied while we have the power to expose the fabricators of\r\n     falsehood and their fabrications.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MATERNAL SOLICITUDE.\r\n\r\n\"And the dear children?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Alexandrina Victoria is a good deal better; but dear little Albert\r\nhere is still very delicate.\"\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by John Leech. From \"Punch,\" Nov. 23rd, 1845._)]\r\n\r\nOne may well wonder whether the \"Standard\" was really serious, or only\r\n\"making believe\" in order to strengthen its attack upon the \"Times.\" But\r\nit suited _Punch_ to take the outburst seriously, though with provoking\r\ncalmness. First retorting that it is well that the editress of the\r\n\"Standard\"--he invariably referred to \"the _editress_\"--wears pattens as\r\na precaution which the nature of her walks renders very necessary,\r\nalthough they are constantly tripping her up, _Punch_ quietly remarked\r\nthat \"'Our Grandmother' must surely have taken an additional drop of\r\n'something comfortable';\" \"and Leech parodied Phiz\" etching of Mrs. Gamp\r\nand Betsy Prig, in which \"the editress\" declares, \"As for that nasty,\r\nhojus _Punch_, I'm dispoged to scratch 'is hi's out a'most. What I ses,\r\nI ses; and what I ses, I sticks to.\" The campaign was conducted with\r\nconsiderable spirit by Gilbert à Beckett and Percival Leigh, with slight\r\nassistance from Horace Mayhew; and was continued with remorseless gaiety\r\nand bitterness for some years. In the pages here devoted to Thackeray\r\nreference is made to the personal feeling which existed between him and\r\nthe \"Morning Post\" and to the effective retaliation on the part of that\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ loyalty, as a matter of fact, has always been above suspicion\r\nand above proof. Democrat as he was, and independent in his views, he\r\nwas as indignant as the \"Standard\" itself when the half-demented Bean\r\nmade his attempt upon the Queen's life; yet gleeful to a degree when his\r\nLiege Lady was called upon to pay income-tax precisely as all her\r\nsubjects did. The birth of the Prince of Wales, which coincided with\r\nLord Mayor's Day, provided _Punch_ with an opportunity for showing much\r\nloyalty and more wit; and the interest with which he followed the\r\neducation and amusements of the Heir-Apparent, the anxiety with which he\r\nmade suggestions for the best appointments, in his nursery-household, to\r\nthe office of the \"Master of the (Rocking) Horse,\" the \"Clerk of the\r\nPea-Shooter,\" and so forth; the delight with which, by the hand of Leech\r\n(1846), he published a charming cartoon of the lad as a man-o'-war's\r\nman, thus popularising the dress of English boys, while the sketch\r\nitself was widely reproduced as a bronze or plaster group--all this\r\nproved the benevolent sentiments he entertained towards the Royal\r\nFamily. This benevolence has cropped up again and again--when the Prince\r\nvisited Canada and America (1860); when, in 1861, he went up to Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge (the Mayor and Corporation coming in for severe\r\ncriticism, however, for their snobbish Address); when he married; when\r\nhe fell ill and recovered; and when he celebrated his Jubilee--on which\r\noccasion _Punch_ declared that \"the longer he knew him the better he\r\nliked him\"--a sentiment the genuineness of which could hardly have been\r\nquestioned by any but the blindest of critics. From first to last\r\n_Punch_ has been a respectful godfather, and a wise and kindly guardian.\r\n\r\nTowards the Queen herself _Punch_ has shown unswerving chivalry and\r\nreverence, even during the shouting days when democracy was more noisily\r\nrepublican than it is to-day. The Queen figures often in the earlier\r\ncartoons, and the care with which the draughtsmen sought to do justice\r\nto the pure outline of her fair face is at least a tribute to their\r\ngood taste. _Punch_ never affected to regard her as a mere figurehead,\r\nbut always represented her in a position of authority, her Ministers in\r\ncharacter of domestic servants taking her instructions, and not at all\r\ntendering advice; and every important incident in the life of the Queen\r\nhas been touched upon with the utmost respect and sympathy.\r\n\r\nBut with the Prince Consort the case was somewhat different. As Mr.\r\nBurnand and Mr. Arthur à Beckett have written[21]:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is strange to note that, until the hour of his death, the man\r\n     whose memory is now universally respected was highly unpopular with\r\n     the general public. The Democritus of Fleet Street was, and is,\r\n     essentially representative, and the popular opinion of the merits\r\n     or demerits of H.R.H. is constantly shown. Only a few weeks after\r\n     the cartoon\" [of the Prince Consort tying up his door-knocker on\r\n     the occasion of the birth of the Princess Beatrice] \"Mr. Punch is\r\n     drawn looking at the portrait of the Prince Consort at a review at\r\n     the Royal Academy, and saying, \"No. 24. A field-marshal; h'm--very\r\n     good indeed. What sanguinary engagement can it be?\" That these\r\n     satirical observations were made simply at Prince Albert's expense,\r\n     and were not intended to reflect upon the Queen or the rest of the\r\n     Royal Family, is shown by the extremely hearty manner in which the\r\n     marriage of the Princess Royal was welcomed by Mr. Punch as\r\n     representing the English feeling. John Bull is heard saying, as he\r\n     hands over to the Imperial Princess of Germany her dowry, 'There,\r\n     my child! God bless you! And may you make as good a wife as your\r\n     mother.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the real source of the Prince Consort's unpopularity\r\nwas his foreign nationality, added to the ignorance of the people of his\r\nenthusiasm and indefatigable efforts for the public weal. His rapid\r\npromotion in military rank, already referred to, was not appreciated in\r\nthe country, and was mercilessly lampooned in _Punch_; and attention was\r\nattracted to the fact that from that time forward the Duke of Wellington\r\nalways prefixed the initials \"F.M.\" in his short, brusque third-person\r\nletters. \"H.R.H. F.M. Paterfamilias\" was for some time one of the chief\r\nof _Punch's_ stock jests. The Prince was pursued into his private\r\napartments, and shown as a _père de famille_ in not the most respectful\r\nspirit. In one picture he is represented in his dressing-gown conferring\r\nupon \"P--pps the Fortunate\" the Knighthood of the Shower Bath; in\r\nothers, the effect of Time upon his head and figure are dwelt upon with\r\nreal sardonic relish. The misapprehensions of the public were not\r\nunnaturally reflected by _Punch_, and a cut was much applauded in which\r\nthe Prince was shown stopped by a policeman in Trafalgar Square when in\r\nthe act of removing a couple of pictures from the National Gallery.\r\n_Punch_ pointedly inquires, \"Taking them to Kensington Gore? Suppose you\r\nleave 'em where they are, eh?\"\r\n\r\nMore justifiable perhaps, but still somewhat harsh, was _Punch's_\r\nprotest (1854) against the Prince's supposed interference in State\r\npolitics. He is shown skating on the ice, warned off by Mr. Punch from a\r\nsection of it labelled \"Foreign Affairs--Dangerous.\" And in the same\r\nyear he is attacked with extraordinary gusto by reason of the new hat he\r\nhad devised for the British army--or, at least, for the Guards. In 1843\r\nthe first \"Albert shako\" had appeared, and Leech, in a cartoon called\r\n\"Prince Albert's Studio,\" exhibited it as a pretended work of art in the\r\nmost ludicrous light. Again, in 1847 the Prince had invented a similar\r\nheadgear, popularly christened \"the Albert Hat,\" which _Punch_ converted\r\nto his uses and worked to death. \"The New Albert Bonnet for the Guards\"\r\nridicules the idea unmercifully, and \"the British Grenadier as improved\r\nby His Royal Highness Prince Albert, decidedly calculated to frighten\r\nthe Russians,\" was another grotesque perversion of a praiseworthy\r\nattempt with which Mr. Punch was in his heart a good deal in sympathy.\r\nFor his artists were as diligent as the Prince in trying to improve the\r\nuniform of the British soldier, contrasting with its wretched\r\ninconvenience the serviceability and ease of the sailor's. The drawing\r\nin which a private, half choked by his stock, held helplessly rigid by\r\nhis straps and buckles, and unable to hold his gun as his \"head's coming\r\noff!\" illustrates the fact that _Punch's_ views and Prince Albert's had\r\nmuch in common. We have the authority of Sir Theodore Martin, in his\r\nbiography (Vol. II., p. 299), that the Prince Consort took _Punch's_\r\nhumours in very good part, and made a large collection of the\r\ncaricatures of the day, in the belief that in them alone could the true\r\nposition of a public man be recognised. But it is said that soon after\r\nthis last crusade a hint was received from Windsor Castle to the effect\r\nthat a little less personality and a little more justice in respect to\r\nthe Prince would be appreciated, as much by the people as by the Court.\r\nIt is certain that after this time the attacks practically came to an\r\nend. And when the Prince died, there were few truer mourners in the\r\nland, and the widowed Queen had few sincerer sympathisers, than the\r\njester whose raillery had been so keen, and who felt too late a generous\r\nremorse.\r\n\r\n\"It was too soon to die,\" wrote Shirley Brooks in a poem called, simply,\r\n\"Albert, December Fourteenth, 1861\"--\r\n\r\n  \"It was too soon to die.\r\n    Yet, might we count his years by triumphs won,\r\n    By wise, and bold, and Christian duties done,\r\n  It were no brief eventless history.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Could there be closer tie\r\n    'Twixt us, who, sorrowing, own a nation's debt,\r\n    And Her, our own dear Lady, who as yet\r\n  Must meet her sudden woe with tearless eye:\r\n\r\n  \"When with a kind relief\r\n    Those eyes rain tears, O might this thought employ!\r\n    Him whom she loved we loved. We shared her joy,\r\n  And will not be denied to share her grief.\"\r\n\r\n_Punch_ always had a number of butts on hand--men whom he attacked for\r\ntheir delinquencies, real or imaginary, or whom on account of\r\nidiosyncrasies he thought to be fair game, just for the fun of it. One\r\nof the first of these was Lord William Lennox, a nobleman of literary\r\npretensions, whose efforts, however, were said to be more pretentious\r\nthan literary. His novel of \"The Tuft-Hunter\" was quickly \"spotted\" by\r\nthe critics, and Hood was the first to declare that the book was little\r\nelse than a patchwork from his own \"Tylney Hall,\" from \"The Lion,\" and\r\nfrom Scott's \"Antiquary,\" though the \"names and epithets\" were changed.\r\n\"Such kind of borrowing as this,\" Milton has said, \"if it be not\r\nbettered by the borrower, among good authors is accounted plagiarè;\" and\r\nas plagiarism of the most unblushing character _Punch_ adjudged it. Hood\r\nhimself contributed his mite to the discussion in the paper in the form\r\nof the following:--\r\n\r\n\"EPIGRAM\r\n\r\n\"_On the 'Tuft-Hunter,' by Lord William Lennox._\r\n\r\n  \"A duke once declared--and most solemnly, too--That\r\n  whatever he liked with his own he would do;\r\n  But the son of a duke has gone further and shown\r\n  He will do what he likes when it isn't his own!\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was Hood who inspired Jerrold with the idea of the biting article\r\nheaded \"Daring Robbery by a Noble Lord-_Punch's_ Police.\" In this\r\ninstance _Punch_ was genuinely indignant, and he proceeded to make Lord\r\nWilliam's life a burden to him with such announcements as: \"Shortly will\r\nbe published, in two volumes, 8vo, a new work, entitled 'Future and\r\nNever,' by Lord W. Lennox, author of Carlyle's 'Past and Present,' etc.\r\netc., and of Wordsworth's 'We are Six and One';\" and again \"Prize Comedy\r\nby Lord W. Lennox: 'Academy for Scandal';\" while a portion of _Punch's_\r\npreface to his sixth volume (1844) was supposed to be written by Lord\r\nWilliam, and presented a most laughable compound of sayings and\r\nquotations, with slight alteration, from well-known authors. But when\r\n_Punch_ dropped him, the unhappy author was not left alone, for the\r\n\"Great Gun\" and other journals picked him up, and played with what\r\nremained of his literary reputation.\r\n\r\nIt was in his second number that _Punch_ began his persistent ridicule\r\nof Jullien, the famous _chef d'orchestre_ who introduced the Promenade\r\nConcerts to Drury Lane, with such prodigious success. The poem, from the\r\npen of W. H. Wills, began characteristically--\"One--crash! Two--clash!\r\nThree--dash! Four--smash!!\" and, not wholly without malevolence,\r\ndescribed the popular conductor as a\r\n\r\n          \"_ci-devant_ waiter\r\n  Of a _quarante-sous traiteur_ \"--\r\n\r\nthus laying the foundation for the charges of musical ignorance,\r\nilliteracy, musical-\"ghost\"-employment, and other imposture, under which\r\nhe suffered in this country nearly all his life. Jullien indignantly\r\ndenied the hard impeachment, and declared that he began his musical life\r\nas a fifer in the French navy, and had in that capacity been present on\r\na man-o'-war at the battle of Solferino in 1829. His assailant accepted\r\nthe statement as to his military achievement, adding the suggestion that\r\nafter working himself up to more than concert pitch, and \"holding in his\r\nhand one sharp, which he turned into several flats,\" Jullien withdrew\r\nfrom the service on account of the discord of battle, particularly as\r\nthe shrieks of the wounded were horribly out of tune.\r\n\r\n_Punch_ fell back on Jullien's well-oiled ringlets, his general _tenue_\r\nand violent gesticulation, and, with better cause, on his \"Row Polka,\"\r\nand on those wild and frenzied quadrilles in which the music in one part\r\nwas \"accentuated with a salvo of artillery.\" But _Punch_, ignoring the\r\nbetter part of Jullien's musical ability, made no allowance for the\r\ncurious quality of his mind, which was evidently ill-balanced, and\r\nindeed was finally overthrown. Jullien's vanity, for example, was\r\nsublime, rivalling that of the Knellers and Greuzes of earlier days; and\r\nhis biographer sets forth how, in the scheme he imagined for the\r\ncivilisation of the world by means of music, he had determined (though\r\nessentially a \"dance musician\") to set to music the Lord's Prayer. It\r\ncould not fail, said Jullien, to be an unprecedented success, with two\r\nof the greatest names in history on its title-page! The musician\r\nultimately died through over-work, the consequence of an honourable\r\nattempt to meet his liabilities.\r\n\r\nSir Peter Laurie was another favourite quarry, who almost from the\r\nbeginning was singled out of the Corporation, of which he was really one\r\nof the most efficient members, because he aimed at \"putting down\" by the\r\nstern administration of justice what, perhaps, could only be dealt with\r\nby sympathy. _Punch_ chose to interpret Sir Peter's views into regarding\r\npoverty less as a misfortune than as _primâ-facie_ evidence of the poor\r\nman's guilt or folly; but it was when the well-meaning alderman so far\r\n\"opened his mouth as to put his foot into it,\" by declaring, when trying\r\na case, \"that it was his intention to put down suicide,\" that Jerrold's\r\npen stuck him on to _Punch's_ page, and heaped ridicule on him from\r\nevery point of view. Alderman Moon, the famous print-seller of\r\nThreadneedle Street, was another butt--the more unjustly (though he\r\ncertainly did sometimes cut a ridiculous figure) as he rendered real\r\nservice to artists, and looked upon English art and its patronage in a\r\nbroad and patriotic way, even while he made his own fortune in doing so.\r\nThis, however, he did not succeed in retaining, and his acts and motives\r\nwere sneered at, and his \"testimonial\" fatally ridiculed.\r\n\r\nThen Harrison Ainsworth, as much for his good-looks and his literary\r\nvanity, as for his tendency to reprint his romances in such journals as\r\ncame under his editorship, was the object of constant banter. An epigram\r\nput the case very neatly:--\r\n\r\n  Says Ainsworth to Colburn,[22]\r\n    \"A plan in my pate is,\r\n  To give my romance, as\r\n    A supplement, _gratis_.\"\r\n  Says Colburn to Ainsworth,\r\n    \"'Twill do very nicely,\r\n  For that will be charging\r\n    Its value precisely.\"\r\n\r\nHarrison Ainsworth could not have his portrait painted, nor write a\r\nnovel of crime and sensation, without being regarded as a convenient peg\r\nfor pleasantry. Similarly did Tom Taylor fall foul of Bulwer Lytton (p.\r\n91, Vol. IX.) by reason of the dedication of \"Zanoni\" to Gibson the\r\nsculptor, in which it was said that the book was not for \"the common\r\nherd.\" The story of Lytton's castigation by Tennyson is duly related\r\nwhere the Laureate's contributions to _Punch_ are spoken of. In Lytton's\r\ncase, at least, _Punch_ forgot to apply Swift's aphorism that a man has\r\njust as much vanity as he has understanding.\r\n\r\nOf the artists, Turner perhaps lent himself most to _Punch's_ satire.\r\nRuskin had not yet arisen to champion the mighty painter's\r\nill-appreciated art; and Turner's colour-dreams, in which \"form\" was\r\noften to a great extent ignored, were not more tempting to the satirical\r\nPhilistine than those extraordinary quotations from his formless epic,\r\ncalled \"The Fallacies of Hope,\" extracts from which he loved to append\r\nto his pictures' titles. Nothing could be better in the way of satire\r\nthan the manner in which _Punch_ turned upon the poor painter, and\r\n\"guy'd\" his picture with a burlesque of his own poetic \"style.\" It was\r\nin the Royal Academy of 1845 that the artist exhibited his celebrated\r\n\"Venice--Returning from the Ball;\" and this is how _Punch_ received\r\nit:--\r\n\r\n  \"Oh! what a scene!--Can this be Venice? No.\r\n  And yet methinks it is--because I see\r\n  Amid the lumps of yellow, red, and blue\r\n  Something which looks like a Venetian spire.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  This in my picture I would fain convey;\r\n  I hope I do. Alas! _What_ FALLACY!\"\r\n\r\nTurner, unhappily, was acutely sensitive to these attacks; but _Punch_\r\ncared little for that, and probably--to do him justice--knew still less.\r\nIt is, however, notable that--doubtless on account of that very\r\ncommon-sense which has nearly always kept him right on great\r\nquestions--_Punch_ has usually in art been nearly as much a Philistine\r\nas the public he represents. When Sir Edward Burne-Jones burst forth\r\ninto the artistic firmament, _Punch_ joined, if not the mockers, at\r\nleast the severer critics. \"BURN JONES?\" said he; \"by all means do.\" Of\r\nthe exquisite \"Mirror of Venus\" and \"The Beguiling of Merlin\" he ignored\r\nthe poetry, and saw little but the quaintness, his criticism being the\r\nmore weighty for its being clever. Of the first-named picture he\r\nobserved:--\r\n\r\n  \"Or crowding round one pool, from flowery shelves\r\n    A group of damsels bowed the knee\r\n  Over reflections solid as themselves\r\n    And like as peasen be.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in the latter\r\n\r\n  \"... mythic Uther's diddled _son_ was seen\r\n  Packed in a trunk with cramped limbs awry,\r\n  Spell-fettered by a Siren, limp and lean,\r\n  And at least twelve heads high.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt, the grounds of _Punch's_ opposition were not only those which\r\nare recognised as belonging to the humorist; they consisted not a little\r\nin that healthy hatred of the affectation with which so much good art is\r\nhusked. In more recent times _Punch_ did not ignore the fine decorative\r\nqualities of Mr. Aubrey Beardsley's art, though he plainly loathed the\r\nmorbid ugliness of much of its conception and detail.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no one was more heartily attacked than Charles Kean--\"Young\r\nKean,\" it was the fashion to call him--probably because between Jerrold\r\nand the actor there had been a serious quarrel. As to this, which took\r\nits rise in the pre-_Punch_ days, nothing need here be said; it is fully\r\ndealt with in the wit's biography. In the words of the present Editor:\r\n\"Only tardily was something like justice done to Kean's influence on the\r\ndrama of our time, by _Punch_, who had been one of the first to sound\r\nthe note of warning about that 'stage-upholstery' which was the first\r\nsign of the growth of realism in dramatic art.\" _Punch_ loved to\r\ncontrast the younger Kean with his more gifted father, and had no\r\npatience with the raucous voice and bad enunciation of the son; but his\r\nsketch of the actor as Sardanapalus (1853), \"with a wine-cup of the\r\nperiod,\" sets on record one of the most perfect archæological revivals\r\nthat had ever been seen on the English stage. But it was Kean's\r\n\"Mephistopheles\" (1854) that afforded _Punch_ his chance, for the\r\nactor's realisation was so wide of Goethe's creation that it was a\r\nFrenchified demon, played as a comic character. _Punch_ admitted the\r\nbeauty of the production, but said that \"as a piece of show and\r\nmechanism (wires unseen) it will draw the eyes of the town, especially\r\nthe eyes with the least brains behind them.\" Kean's performance was\r\ndenounced as devoid of life and beauty, but generous praise was accorded\r\nto his newly made-up nose, to which the best part of the criticism was\r\ndevoted. \"It has the true demoniacal curve,\" he said; \"we never saw a\r\nbetter view of the devil's bridge.\" And so, throughout, _Punch_ dogged\r\nKean's progress. But as time went on, his criticism lost the taint of\r\npersonal feeling; and Kean was recognised at last as our leading\r\ntragedian, though to the end he was never accepted as a great actor.\r\n\r\nA pretty accurate estimate as to _Punch's_ pet \"black beasts\" and\r\npopular butts at this time may be formed by the list drawn up in the\r\npaper of those persons whom _Punch_ would exercise his right to\r\n\"challenge\" if, in accordance with Mr. Serjeant Murphy's suggestion in\r\nthe House of Commons, _Punch_ were put upon his trial for conspiracy,\r\napropos of Cobden. From such a jury, we are told, there would be struck\r\noff, in addition to those names already given, Mr. Grant (author of \"The\r\nGreat Metropolis\"), Baron Nathan the composer, Alderman Gibbs, D. W.\r\nOsbaldiston (of the Surrey Theatre), Colonel Sibthorpe, and Moses the\r\ntailor.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the work of Jerrold, I draw attention to the merciless\r\nonslaught on Samuel Carter Hall, editor of the \"Art Journal\" and founder\r\nof the \"Art Union,\" as it was at first called. Hall was Pecksniff; the\r\n\"Art Union\" was \"The Pecksniffery;\" and _Punch_ courted the libel action\r\nwhich Hall threatened but failed to bring. That \"the literary Pecksniff\"\r\ntook this course could not but create a bad impression at the time, and\r\nHall has therefore been put down as one of the butts whom _Punch_ had\r\njustly assailed. Of course his sententious catch-phrase of appealing to\r\n\"hand, head, and heart\" was always made the most of, and _Punch_\r\ndelighted in paraphrasing it as \"gloves, hat, and waistcoat.\"\r\n\r\nBut the two non-political persons whom _Punch_ most persistently and\r\nvigorously attacked were Mr. James Silk Buckingham and Mr. Alfred Bunn;\r\nand these two campaigns must, perhaps, be counted the most elaborate of\r\ntheir kind which _Punch_ has undertaken in his career--though in neither\r\nhad he very much to be proud of when all was said and done. Mr. J. S.\r\nBuckingham, sometime Member of Parliament, was a gentleman\r\nphilanthropically inclined and of literary instincts, a man who had\r\ntravelled greatly, and who in many of the schemes he had\r\nundertaken--including the founding of the \"Athenæum\" in 1828--had\r\nusually had the support of a number of the most reputable persons in the\r\ncountry. His latest idea was the establishing of the British and Foreign\r\nInstitute--a sort of counterpart in intention of the present Colonial\r\nInstitute; but as all of Mr. Buckingham's schemes had not succeeded, and\r\nas he retained chambers in the club-house of what _Punch_ insisted upon\r\ncalling the \"British and Foreign [or 'Outlandish'] Destitute,\" the\r\njournal was convinced that something more than a _primâ-facie_ case had\r\nbeen made out against the promoter, who, being assumed to live upon the\r\nmembers' subscriptions, was harried in the paper from its first volume,\r\nchiefly at first by the slashing pen of Jerrold, and--in small\r\nparagraphs--by the more delicate rapier of Horace Mayhew. These charges\r\nof mal-administration and other offensive imputations against a\r\nsemi-public man whose chief faults seem to have been an over-sanguine\r\ntemperament and a slight disposition towards self-advertisement,\r\nattracted wide notice, and _Punch_ devoted in all considerable space to\r\nthe prosecution of this mistaken campaign. Unfortunately for Buckingham,\r\na member of the Institute, a Mr. George Jones--who had published a good\r\ndeal of dramatic nonsense under the title of \"Tecumseh\"--came to his\r\nsupport with a ridiculous, inflated letter, which _Punch_ promptly\r\nprinted with the signature engraved in facsimile. Thereupon Jones,\r\nfinding the doubtful honour of publicity unexpectedly thrust upon him,\r\ndenounced the letter as a forgery; so _Punch_, had it lithographed and\r\ncirculated among the members, \"just to show how good the forgery was.\"\r\nJones forthwith began an action for libel, which _Punch_ defended. The\r\ngenuineness of the document, however, was established, and Jones\r\nwithdrew from the action, paying all costs.\r\n\r\nThe sins of Jones were naturally added to Buckingham's account, and the\r\nlatter decided--as Leech once effectively threatened to do--to \"draw\"\r\nand defend himself. He published a pamphlet entitled \"The Slanders of\r\n_Punch_\" felicitously quoting as his motto from Proverbs xxvi. 18, \"As a\r\nmad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, so is the man that\r\ndeceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?\"--he appealed for\r\njustice to the public, and especially to \"the 200,000 readers of\r\n_Punch_\" denouncing the persecution, and making known the fact that\r\nJerrold had originally applied for membership of his Institute, but had\r\nfailed to take up his election, whereupon his name was erased from the\r\nbooks. Ten thousand handbills were circulated, and six thousand copies\r\nof the threepenny pamphlet, in various editions, were sold. _Punch's_\r\nanswer was a whole page of savage, biting satire from Jerrold (p. 241,\r\nVol. IX.), which, however, was too bombastic and \"ultrafluvial\" to be\r\nwholly effective. Thackeray's page article on \"John Jones's Remonstrance\r\nabout the Buckingham Business\" (p. 261) was far more to the\r\npoint--amusing, politic, and shrewd--and drew the quarrel within its\r\nproper limits, by imparting to it a more jocular tone. Addressing the\r\npaper, he says, \"At page 241 you are absolutely serious. That page of\r\n_Punch_ is a take-in. _Punch_ ought never to be virtuously indignant or\r\nabsolutely serious;\" and with these words, re-affirming the maxim which\r\n_Punch_ had forgotten in his heat, he restored peace, patched up the\r\npaper's reputation for good-humour, and with a skilful word covered its\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nBut _Punch_ found his Waterloo, as it was considered at the time, at the\r\nhands of Alfred Bunn. Bunn was the theatrical and operatic manager and\r\nman of letters--or, rather, as the letters were so insignificant, the\r\n\"man of _notes_.\" As early as 1816 he had produced a volume of verse.\r\nSuch verse!--sentimental, washy, and \"woolly\" to a degree. Three years\r\nlater he put his name to 'Tancred: a Tale,' by the author of 'Conrad: a\r\nTragedy,' lately performed at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham--of which\r\nhe was manager for a spell before he came to London--and from time to\r\ntime he gave forth other works, such as \"The Stage, both Before and\r\nBehind the Curtain,\" three volumes of rather shrewd \"Observations taken\r\non the Spot\" (1840), and \"Old England and New England\" (1853). He\r\ndelivered lectures, too, at the St. James's Theatre, three times a week,\r\non the History of the Stage, and the Genius and Career of\r\nShakespeare--lectures which he also delivered in America. His verses,\r\nthough vapid balderdash for the most part, were well adapted to music,\r\nand his ballads \"When other Lips and other Hearts,\" \"The Light of other\r\nDays,\" \"In Happy Moments Day by Day\" (sung in Fitzball's \"Maritana\"),\r\nenjoyed enormous popularity.\r\n\r\nStill, the whole attitude, the whole bearing of the man--his showy,\r\nalmost comic, appearance and his grandiloquence of expression--as well\r\nas the tremendous character of the wording of his theatrical bills,\r\nafforded points of attack from the moment that he caught the public eye,\r\nthat no caricaturist or humorist could resist. As early as 1832 Jerrold\r\nwas lampooning him in his \"Punch in London.\" In the following year\r\nThackeray held him up to ridicule in his \"National Standard,\" that was\r\nfated to collapse a few months later, and honoured him with immortality\r\nin \"Flore and Zephyr;\"[23] and soon after, Gilbert à Beckett satirised\r\nhim in \"Figaro in London.\" In 1833 \"Alfred the Little; or, Management! A\r\nPlay as rejected at Drury Lane, by a Star-gazer,\" was another satire of\r\ndistinct severity.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that as soon as _Punch_ was started the\r\nwits combined to continue the game which they had already, separately\r\nenjoyed, and which the public presumably found amusing. The other papers\r\njoined in _Punch's_ cry, the \"Great Gun\" showing pre-eminent zeal in its\r\nstalking of \"Signor Bombastes Bunnerini.\" From the moment of _Punch's_\r\nbirth onwards, Bunn was one of his most ludicrous and fairest butts.\r\nWhen he wrote verse, he was \"The Poet Bunn;\" when he was annoyed at\r\nthat, or anything else, he was \"Hot Cross Bunn.\" His deposition from the\r\nmanagement of Drury Lane and his appointment to the Vauxhall Gardens\r\nwere coincident with _Punch's_ appearance, and the publication of his\r\n\"Vauxhall Papers,\" illustrated by Alfred Crowquill, again drew attention\r\nto himself. No sooner was the fierce controversy begun as to the\r\npropriety of including a statue of Cromwell among the Sovereigns of\r\nEngland in the new Palace of Westminster, a matter decided fifty years\r\nlater, than _Punch_ gravely mooted the question--\"Shall Poet Bunn have a\r\nStatue?\" Then when his reign at Drury Lane was resumed, and opera was\r\nhis grand enterprise, Bunn became _Punch's_ \"Parvus Apollo,\" while\r\nScribe's libretto to Donizetti's music was to be \"undone into English\"\r\nby the Poet himself; and the persecuted manager was throughout the\r\nsubject of some of the happiest and most comic efforts of Leech's\r\npencil.\r\n\r\nAt last, after supporting a six years' persistent cannonade, Bunn\r\ndetermined to strike a blow for liberty. His plan was to issue a\r\nreply--a swift and sudden attack, as personal and offensive as he could\r\nmake it--in the form of _Punch's_ own self, enough like it in appearance\r\nto amuse the public, if not actually to deceive it. He secured the help\r\nof Mr. George Augustus Sala, then a young artist whose pencil was\r\nenlisted in the service of \"The Man in the Moon,\" and who had as yet\r\nlittle idea of the journalistic eminence to which he was to rise. He had\r\npreviously submitted sketches to Mark Lemon for use in _Punch_, which\r\nhad been summarily and, as he tells me, \"unctuously declined,\" and in\r\nhis share of the work he doubtless tasted some of the sweets of revenge,\r\nand richly earned the epithet which Lemon thereupon applied to him of\r\n\"graceless young whelp.\"\r\n\r\nIf the front page of this production be compared with Doyle's first\r\n_Punch_ cover on p. 47, the extent of the imitation will be appreciated.\r\nThe size was the same, and the _Punch_ lettering practically identical;\r\nbut otherwise the resemblance was of a general character. If the design\r\nis examined, it will be seen that the groups are chiefly composed of\r\n_Punch's_ victims and his Staff. At the top the \"Man in the Moon\"\r\npresides; below, the \"Great Gun\" is firing away at the dejected\r\nhunchback in the pillory. Toby is hanged on his master's own gallows;\r\nand the puppets are strewn about. Thackeray leans for support against\r\nPunch's broken big drum; Tom Taylor is beside him--Horace (\"Ponny\")\r\nMayhew lies helpless in his box; while next to him Gilbert à Beckett is\r\nprone upon his face, leaving his barrister's wig upon the \"block-head.\"\r\nJerrold, as a wasp, is gazing ruefully at the bâton which has dropped\r\nfrom Punch's feeble hands; and Mark Lemon, dressed as a pot-boy, is\r\nstraining himself in the foreground to reach his pewter-pot. Around\r\nfloat many of _Punch's_ butts, political and social. Wellington on the\r\nleft and Brougham on the right play cup-and-ball with him. Louis\r\nPhilippe has him on a toasting-fork, and Lord John Russell hangs him on\r\na gallows-tree. Palmerston, Prince de Joinville, Jullien, Sibthorpe,\r\nMoses the tailor, Buckingham, and many more besides, are to be\r\nrecognised. It was inscribed \"No. 1,--(to be continued if necessary)\"--a\r\ncontingency, however, that did not arise.\r\n\r\nIt is usually considered that Bunn engaged a clever writer to write his\r\ntext for him; but it is quite likely that he wrote the whole work\r\nhimself, simply submitting it to the \"editing\" of some more experienced\r\njournalist, probably Albert Smith. Much of the manner is his own, and,\r\nas Mr. Joseph Knight agrees,[24] it \"has many marks of Bunn's style, and\r\nis in part incontestably his.\"\r\n\r\nHis \"Word\" is directed at _Punch's_ \"three Puppets--Wronghead (Mr.\r\nDouglas Jerrold), Sleekhead (Mr. Gilbert à Beckett), and Thickhead (Mr.\r\nMark Lemon)--formidable names, Punch! and, as being three to one,\r\nformidable odds!\" He refers to his friends having warned him not to\r\nrebel against Punch's attacks, as he is\r\n\r\n     a public character!! Pray, Punch, are not these, your puppets,\r\n     public characters? Have they not acted in public, laboured for the\r\n     public, catered for the public? Has not Douglas Jerrold been hissed\r\n     off the stage by the public? Have not à Beckett's writings! been\r\n     acted, and damned, in public? and as to Mark Lemon, there can be no\r\n     doubt of _his_ being a public character, for he some time since\r\n     kept a _public_-house!!! All ceremony therefore is at an end\r\n     between us.... There may be other misdemeanours of which they have\r\n     from time to time thought me guilty; but the grand one of all is,\r\n     that I have taken the liberty of attempting to write poetry, and\r\n     have produced on the stage my own works in preference to theirs....\r\n     Did you ever see them act, Punch? Did you ever see Douglas Jerrold\r\n     in his own piece, entitled \"The Painter of Ghent\"? If not, I can\r\n     only say you are a devilish lucky fellow! Did you ever see him and\r\n     Mark Lemon act at Miss Kelly's theatre? and if so, did you ever see\r\n     such an awful exhibition?... and if, as _they_ say, they _did_\r\n     \"hold the mirror up to Nature,\" _I_ say it was only to _cast\r\n     reflections_ upon her!! Did you read, Punch, the criticisms written\r\n     _by_ themselves _upon_ themselves in the next day's papers? If you\r\n     did not, you have a treat to come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WRAPPER OF \"A WORD WITH PUNCH.\" (_Designed by George\r\nAugustus Sala._)]\r\n\r\nAnd so forth. Then, presenting the head of Jerrold on the body of an\r\nunusually wriggling serpent, which he gives forth as being from\r\n\"portraits in possession of the family,\" he goes on to \"say something\"\r\nof the man of savage sarcasm and \"bilious bitings:\"--\r\n\r\n     Now, with all his failings, let me record my opinion that it is to\r\n     Jerrold's pen you are indebted, Punch, for the fame you once\r\n     enjoyed; for, beyond any doubt, he is a fellow of infinite ability.\r\n     I have known him some years, and the last time but one I ever _saw_\r\n     him was in 1842, when, meeting me in St. James's Street, he thanked\r\n     me for a handsome critique he believed me to have written on his\r\n     comedy of \"Bubbles of the Day,\" and on that occasion he said a\r\n     better thing, Punch, than he has written in your pages. I said to\r\n     him, \"What, you are picking up character, I suppose?\"--to which he\r\n     replied, \"There's plenty of it lost, in this neighbourhood.\" The\r\n     last time I ever _heard_ from him was during the first visit of\r\n     Duprez to Drury Lane Theatre, when I received the following note\r\n     from  him:--\r\n\r\n                                                       Wednesday.\r\n     \"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     Will you enable me to hear your French nightingale--_do pray_,\r\n\r\n                             Yours very truly,\r\n                                       D. JERROLD.\"\r\n\r\n     --which is the vilest pun ever perpetrated at the expense of that\r\n     eminent singer.... Unlike the other two of his party, he is a man\r\n     of undoubted genius; but all who admit this, at the same time\r\n     regret the frequent misdirection of his mind. He is one of the most\r\n     ill-conditioned, spiteful, vindictive, and venomous writers in\r\n     existence, and whatever honey _was_ in his composition, has long\r\n     since turned to gall.... Can it be possible [he adds, after digging\r\n     up and quoting some of Jerrold's feeblest verse] that it never\r\n     occurs to a wholesale dealer in slander and ridicule that he is\r\n     liable to be assailed by the very weapons he useth against others?\r\n\r\nThen comes the portrait of Gilbert Abbott à Beckett, in wig and gown,\r\nbut with devil's hoofs and tail. On him the attack is savage in the\r\nextreme, the details of his _early_ lack of financial success being\r\npublished, and the whole dismissed with the comprehensive remark: \"a\r\nvery prolific person, this friend of yours, Punch!--editor of thirteen\r\nperiodicals, and lessee of a theatre into the bargain, and all total\r\nfailures!\" After heavy-handed chaff he proceeds to abuse Mark Lemon, up\r\nand down, in similar terms; and with a view to show that others write\r\nverse as bad as his, reprints the weakest lines in his \"Fridolin\" and\r\n\"The Rhine-boat.\" In the course of his very effective attack Bunn\r\nproceeds:--\r\n\r\n     In speaking of the Castle of Heidelberg, which _he_ says is on the\r\n     Rhine, although everyone else says it is on the Neckar, he thus\r\n     apostrophises it:--\r\n\r\n  \"'Tis here the north wind loves to hold\r\n  His dreary revels, loud and cold,\r\n  The nettle's bloom's his daily fare,\r\n  The TOAD _the guest most welcome there_!!\"\r\n\r\n     Whether the last line _gives the reason why Thickhead visited\r\n     Heidelberg does not appear_.\r\n\r\nHe then dots epigrams and so forth--all insults of various degrees of\r\noffensiveness--about the remaining pages, virtually suggesting, in\r\nSheridan's words, that while _Punch's_ circulation has gone down\r\nhopelessly, \"everything about him is a jest except his witticisms.\" The\r\nadvertisements, too, are of a similarly satirical character, one of them\r\nshowing, as an illustration of a \"patent blacking,\" Mark Lemon (as\r\npot-boy) looking at his own likeness in the polish of a Wellington boot\r\nwhich reflects a rearing donkey. The last cut represents a medicine\r\nbottle with a label inscribed \"This dose to be repeated, should the\r\npatients require it,\" and the \"Notice to Correspondents\" declares that\r\nample material is left for future use. Such further publication,\r\nhowever, was never called for. _Punch_ attempted no reply--inexplicably,\r\none would think, for there must have been something left to say of Hot\r\nCross Bunn. _Punch's_ rivals were not slow to twit him on his defeat,\r\nespecially the \"Puppet Show\" and \"The Man in the Moon,\" the latter of\r\nwhich, in a comic report of the proceedings at the \"Licensing Committee\r\nfor Poets,\" remarked, \"Mr. Alfred Bunn was bitterly opposed on personal\r\ngrounds by a person named Punch; but Mr. Bunn having intimated his wish\r\nto have a Word with Punch, the latter skulked out of court, and _was not\r\nheard of afterwards_.\"\r\n\r\n\"A Word with Punch\"--which the _Punch_ men are said to have bought up as\r\nfar as possible--had a considerable sale, and an \"édition de luxe\" was\r\nalso issued, coloured. The engravings in it were made by Landells, a\r\nmodest piece of vengeance which must, however, have been gratifying, so\r\nfar as it went. It may be added that J. R. Adam, \"the Cremorne Poet,\"\r\ntook up the cudgels unasked in _Punch's_ behalf in a reply entitled \"A\r\nWord with Bunn;\" but this little octavo is as insignificant as its\r\nauthor, and attracted little notice.\r\n\r\nOnce again, in the early days of \"Fun,\" _Punch_ came very near to being\r\nstartled with another such infernal machine. Mr. Clement Scott tells\r\nme:--\"We were offended with _Punch_ for some reason--it was in the Tom\r\nTaylor days--and we meditated, planned out, and nearly executed a second\r\nedition of 'A Word with Punch.' Tom Hood was furious. Sala was in our\r\nconspiracy. In fact, all the 'young lions' of 'Fun' were 'crazy mad.' We\r\nthought we could annihilate poor old _Punch_ with one blow. But we never\r\ndid it--because, I think, although we were plucky, we were impecunious!\r\nWe were very proud, but, alas! our pockets were empty; so the whole\r\ncompany--Hood, Sala, Jeff Prowse, Harry Leigh, Brunton, Paul Gray, W. S.\r\nGilbert, W. B. Rands, Tom Robertson, Clement Scott and Co., had to knock\r\nunder.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Bunn's time may be dated the better taste and greater chivalry that\r\nhave since distinguished _Punch_, even in his most rampant moods. He has\r\nalways had his butts--from the soft-hearted and, at the time,\r\nunpardonably hirsute Colonel Sibthorpe, to Sir R. Temple and Mr.\r\nMcNeill, Mr. Newdegate, Mr. Roebuck, Edwin James, ex-Q.C. (who was\r\ndisbarred for corruption and set up in New York, joining, as _Punch_ put\r\nit, the \"bar sinister\"), Madame Rachel (the \"beautiful for ever\"\r\nenameller, who had not yet been convicted), Colonel North, Sir Francis\r\nBaring, Cox of Finsbury, Wiscount Williams of Lambeth, the Duke of\r\nBuccleuch, Lord Malmsbury, and a host of others. But his attacks rarely\r\noverstepped due limits; nor did _Punch_ ever find another aspiring Bunn\r\namong them. Amongst the inanimate objects which at various times _Punch_\r\nmade his mark were Trafalgar Square and its Fountains (or the \"Squirts,\"\r\nas they were scornfully called), the National Gallery, Mud-Salad Market,\r\nLeicester Square, the Wellington Statue on the Wellington Arch, the\r\nGreat Exhibition, John Bell's Guards' Memorial in Waterloo Place, and\r\nthe British Museum Catalogue--all of which, so far as they represented\r\nLondoners' grievances, have ere now been reformed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] _Mangez bien_, Jenkinsonian French for \"fare well.\"\r\n\r\n[19] Jenkinsonian French for \"thread-bare subject.\"\r\n\r\n[20] On the occasion of _Punch's_ Jubilee, July, 1891, the \"Times\"\r\nremarked; 'May we be excused for noting the fact that he [Punch] has\r\ngenerally, in regard to public affairs, taken his cue from the \"Times\"?'\r\n\r\n[21] \"Fortnightly Review,\" December, 1886.\r\n\r\n[22] His publisher.\r\n\r\n[23] Edmund Yates believed that Bunn was Thackeray's model also for Mr.\r\nDolphin, the manager, in \"Pendennis.\"\r\n\r\n[24] \"Dictionary of National Biography.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n_PUNCH_ ON THE WAR-PATH: COUNTER-ATTACK.\r\n\r\n     Satire and Libel--Mrs. Ramsbotham Assaulted--Attacks of \"The Man in\r\n     the Moon\" and \"The Puppet-Show\"--H. S. Leigh's Banter--Malicious\r\n     Wit--Mr. Pincott--_Punch's_ Purity gives Offence--His Slips of\r\n     Fact--Quotation--And Dialect are Resented--His Drunkards not\r\n     Appreciated by the U.K.A.--\"_Punch_ is not as good as it was!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove the head of every editor the law of libel hangs like the sword of\r\nDamocles. It is at all times difficult for a newspaper of any sort to\r\navoid the infringement of its provisions, vigilant though the editor may\r\nbe. But in the case of a confessedly \"satirical\" journal the danger is\r\nenormously increased, for the margin between \"fair comment\" and flat\r\nlibel shrinks strangely when the _raison d'étre_ of the criticism is\r\npungency, and the object laughter.\r\n\r\nThat _Punch_ has steered clear of giving serious offence, save on\r\noccasions extremely few, must be counted to him for righteousness. It is\r\ntrue that, as a Lord Chancellor once declared, \"_Punch_ is a chartered\r\nlibertine.\" But for him to have won his \"charter\" at all proves him at\r\nleast to have been worthy of it, the tolerance and indulgence of the\r\nnation having been in themselves a temptation. It is not so much that he\r\nhas not hit hard; it is rather that he has hit straight. Indeed, as we\r\nhave seen, he has struck hastily in many directions; but, save in his\r\nyears of indiscretion, he has scarcely ever been guilty of anything\r\napproaching scurrility. At a time when the \"Satirist\" was flinging its\r\ndarts at the peculiarly vulnerable Duke of Brunswick, goading him into\r\nthe writing of his pamphlets, and into that crushing retaliation whereby\r\nthe paper was condemned in five thousand pounds damages, _Punch_ was\r\nperhaps the most moderate public censor and _arbiter elegantiarum_\r\namongst all those who used ridicule and irony as instruments of\r\ncastigation; and indulgence has been the reward that he has reaped.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. George Jones and Mr. S. C. Hall dared not face the ultimate\r\nordeal of a court of law must be held to justify _Punch's_ persistently\r\ncaustic denunciations; while the case of Mr. Gent-Davis, then M.P. for\r\nKennington, served chiefly to confirm the fact that \"abstractions\" and\r\n\"imaginary personages\" find their counterparts, in the opinions of some,\r\nin real life. In this case one of the Staff, who lived in the member's\r\nconstituency, and had taken some interest in local politics, contributed\r\na humorous paper to a series on which he was engaged, and it was\r\npublished in _Punch(_November 13, 1886). In this essay a type of\r\nsuburban lady-politician--a \"study from Mr. Punch's Studio\"--was\r\nsatirised under the name of \"Mrs. Gore-Jenkins.\" Forthwith a summons\r\nagainst the Editor at the Mansion House police court was the result, for\r\nthe Member accepted the description as directed against his wife; but\r\nthe explanation that the article was intended as a mere political satire\r\non an \"imaginary person\" was held to be satisfactory, and the incident\r\nwas finally closed.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion an unflattering poem on a \"popular singer\" was\r\nillustrated, quite innocently by the artist, who probably never saw the\r\nverses, with what appeared to be a portrait of Mr. Isidore de Lara; but\r\nno sooner was the matter pointed out than any intention to offend the\r\nmusician was immediately disclaimed by the paper. At another time one of\r\n_Punch's_ artists showed the little band of Socialists (Messrs.\r\nChampion, Hyndman, and others), who were then before the law on a\r\npolitical charge, as subjects of _Punch's_ traditional \"summary\r\njustice.\" But although _Punch_ was quickly brought to book, his victims\r\ndid not take the matter very seriously. Mr. John Burns, indeed,\r\nconfesses as much in a communication upon the subject. \"On one\r\noccasion,\" he tells me, \"_Punch_ suspended me, pictorially of course,\r\nfrom a gallows tree. This I, of course, regarded as Mr. Punch's humorous\r\ndesire to see me in an elevated position. On other occasions he has been\r\nequally kind but less appropriate in his method of praise or censure.\"\r\n\r\n_Punch_ has altogether had some two-score actions commenced, or\r\nthreatened, against it, by business firms or aggrieved persons or, more\r\noften still, by newspapers on the ground of libel and kindred\r\nwrongdoing. But then, consider how many there are in the world, and in\r\nEngland especially, who will not see a joke!\r\n\r\nA subject upon which _Punch_ has for some years been persistently\r\ntwitted is the personality of \"Mrs. Ramsbotham\"--Thackeray's Mrs. Julia\r\nDorothea Ramsbottom of \"The Snob\" (No. 7, May, 1829)--a homely sort of\r\nMrs. Malaprop, whose constant misquotations and misapplication of words\r\nof somewhat similar sound to those she intends to use give constant\r\namusement to one section of _Punch's_ readers, and irritation quite as\r\nconstant to the other. She is the lady who suffers from a \"torpedo\r\nliver;\" who complains of being \"a mere siphon in her own house;\" who\r\ndischarges her gardener because his answers to her questions are so\r\n\"amphibious;\" and who does not understand how there can be \"illegal\r\ndistress\" in a free country where people may be as unhappy as they like.\r\nThere have, of course, been many originals to this unconscious\r\nhumorist--and are still. One lady, it has been declared, is not unknown\r\nin society, who has held forth to a surprised circle of her\r\nacquaintances on the operation of \"trigonometry\" (tracheotomy)--who,\r\nwhen she imparted a bit of scandal would add, \"but that, you know, as\r\nthe lawyers say, is _inter alias_\"--and who wished that people would\r\nalways say what they meant, and not talk paregorically (metaphorically).\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Ramsbotham\" is obviously descended, through Mrs. Malaprop, from\r\nDogberry, and has many a time been \"condemned to everlasting\r\nredemption,\" at least by the _genus irritabile_. One critic cast his\r\nprotest in the form of a poetic appeal to _Punch_, and published it in\r\nan Oxford journal:--\r\n\r\n  \"Of Mrs. Ram I wish to speak,\r\n    You dear old London Charivari;\r\n  Don't ram her down our throats each week.\r\n    Of sameness do be chary. Vary.\"\r\n\r\nA broader and severer hint was offered by the lively Poet of the London\r\n\"Globe\":--\r\n\r\n  _To Mrs. Ramsbotham._\r\n\r\n   A few there be who still delight,\r\n    O Mrs. R., in _Punch's_ page,\r\n  Who like a joke to wear the blight\r\n      Of age.\r\n\r\n  Who, if they find a grain of wheat,\r\n    Are well content to pass the chaff,\r\n  And, every week, at least complete\r\n      One laugh.\r\n\r\n  But even they who swallow pun\r\n    Unmurm'ring, now and then declare,\r\n  Henceforward they must seek their fun\r\n      Elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  It is when you have multiplied\r\n    Your misconceptions, Mrs. Ram.,\r\n  That patience, sorely thus o'er-tried,\r\n      Says \"----.\"\r\n\r\n  My task is therefore plain: to hint\r\n    That you, true woman to the core,\r\n  Are, when you interfere with print,\r\n      A bore.\r\n\r\n  I would not venture to suggest\r\n    The line of conduct to pursue;\r\n  I state a fact ... and leave the rest\r\n      To you.\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of this bitter cry, the next week's number of _Punch_\r\ncontained a quarter of a page of the lady's reminiscences and three\r\nmisapprehensions. \"O,\" exclaimed the tormented Poet, \"that some Abraham\r\nwould arise to do sacrifice!\" Later on Mr. Furniss arose to the call, as\r\nthe murderous Barons responded to Henry's ejaculation. In \"Lika Joko\"\r\n(November 3, 1894) there was printed an obituary notice of Mrs.\r\nRamsbotham (as nothing in her name had appeared in the previous week's\r\n_Punch_), and a very comic death-bed scene was presented--reminding one\r\nof a similar incident in \"Joe Miller the Younger,\" when that paper,\r\nlike many of the public, grew tired of Mrs. Caudle, and, reporting her\r\n\"sudden death,\" published an engraving by Hine, wherein _Punch_ in\r\nweepers is seen laying a wreath upon her monument, while Toby and his\r\nbâton are both decorated with crape. In \"Lika Joko's\" presentation of\r\nher \"_momentum mori_,\" she babbles of things in general; she is nervous\r\nas to the physic handed to her, and remarks that these medicine bottles\r\nare as like to one another as the two Dominoes in the \"Comedy of\r\nHorrors;\" she declares, as her mind wanders to the Chino-Japanese war,\r\nthat \"the best remedy for political disorders is antimony, but things\r\nmay be different in horizontal nations;\" and, finally, as she sinks\r\nback in death, she fancies she sees a hand a'Becketting to her.\r\nBut _Punch_ ignored the attack; and the report of the death of his\r\nlady-correspondent was duly recognised as a canard.\r\n\r\nBut \"Lika Joko\" is by no means the only comic paper that has attacked\r\n_Punch_, smiting him hip and thigh. The violent charges of plagiarism\r\nwhich for many years it was the fashion to bring against him have\r\nalready been referred to. From the beginning the principal--as it is the\r\neasiest--charge that has been made is the alleged heaviness of _Punch's_\r\nfun or his deficiency of wit; less often, it has been a legitimate\r\ncomplaint of blunder or of journalistic wrongdoing. Some of the most\r\nviolent of these attacks came from the aforesaid \"Joe Miller,\" and from\r\n\"The Great Gun\"--the short-lived journal of distinct ability. In \"The\r\nMan in the Moon\" the pens of Shirley Brooks, James Hannay, and other\r\nwits made it distinctly uncomfortable for _Punch_--but nothing more.\r\nThus to a portrait of Mr. Punch, who is shown in the last degree of\r\nmisery, is appended the legend, \"A CASE OF REAL DISTRESS.--'I haven't\r\nmade a joke for many weeks!'\" (November, 1847). In the next number\r\nappeared the brilliant verses, \"Our Flight with _Punch_,\" from Shirley\r\nBrooks's pen, as well as a sketch of a man speechless with amazement,\r\ndescribed as the \"Portrait of a Gentleman finding a Joke in _Punch_.\"\r\nThen there is the riddle, \"Why is a volume of _Punch_ like a pot of bad\r\ntea?--Because it is full of slow leaves;\" and in the same number, a\r\nbiting satire in anticipation of a play written by some of the _Punch_\r\nStaff and produced at Covent Garden in aid of the family of Leigh Hunt,\r\nends with the words, \"_Every_ resorter to the stalls and boxes will be\r\nexpected to purchase a copy of either 'Dombey,' _Punch_, or 'Jerrold's\r\nWeekly Newspaper,' as, next to benevolence, it is in aid of those works\r\nthat the chief actors appear. N.B.--Strong coffee will be provided to\r\nkeep the audience awake throughout the performance. _Vivant Bradbury et\r\nEvans!_\"\r\n\r\n\"The Puppet-Show\" followed on the same lines, but its attacks were more\r\npersonal. Under the heading of \"A Trio of Punchites\" (April, 1848),\r\nThackeray, Douglas Jerrold, and Gilbert à Beckett were torn limb from\r\nlimb, and later on Mark Lemon and the rest were added to the holocaust;\r\nyet, like the Cardinal of Rheims' congregation, nobody seemed a penny\r\nthe worse. The paper began its fusillade in the first number, and soon\r\ncame out with a large picture, well drawn and engraved in the manner of\r\nthe day, of Mr. Punch, much humiliated, receiving a lecture from Mr.\r\nBull:--\r\n\r\nSHAMEFUL ATTEMPT AT OVERCHARGE!\r\n\r\n     MR. BULL (_a commercial gentleman_)--\"Hallo, Mr. Punch, threepence!\r\n     What do you mean by threepence? Why, the Puppet-Showman supplies a\r\n     better paper for a penny! You must mind what you are about!\"\r\n\r\n     MR. PUNCH--\"Well, sir, you may think it too much, but really the\r\n     article is so very heavy I cannot sell it for less.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the same idea is carried a step further, in the form\r\nof an advertisement: \"NOTICE.--If the heavy joke, which was sent to the\r\n'Puppet-Show' office last Monday, and for which two-and-ninepence was\r\ncharged, be not forthwith removed, it will be sold to _Punch_ to pay\r\nexpenses;\" and later on it hints that the Parisians will do well to\r\nimport a few of _Punch's_ jokes as the best of all possible material for\r\nthe barricades they were then erecting (1848). A graver charge was\r\ncontained under the heading, \"On Sale or Hire,\" and it ran: \"We\r\nperceive, by an advertisement in _Punch_, that the entire work can be\r\npurchased for £4 10s. Judging from its ridiculous puffs of Her\r\nMajesty's Theatre, we should say that it could always be bought by a box\r\nat the Opera.\" This amiable paragraph appeared in a lively column which\r\nwas a weekly feature of the paper, and was headed \"Pins and Needles.\"\r\n\"Pasquin,\" a rival \"comic\" edited by Mr. Sutherland Edwards, was always\r\n\"bandying epithets\" with the Showman, and no sooner was the column\r\nintroduced than he drew pleasing attention to the fact in the following\r\nparagraph: \"The 'Puppet-Show' has started 'Pins and Needles.' We don't\r\nwonder at it. 'Pins and Needles' are always a sign of a defective\r\ncirculation.\"\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, too, pamphlets have been directed against _Punch_,\r\nsuch as the \"Anti-Punch,\"[25] published by the men who naturally fall\r\nunder the lash of a satirist, and resent its application. Of such was\r\nthe widely circulated \"Phrenological Manipulation of the Head of\r\n_Punch_,\" written by George Combe about 1845, in the form of an open\r\nletter. It began, \"Sir, you are not an honest man.... Practically your\r\nbenevolence is merely professional, it is only for the readers of\r\n_Punch_. Why do you act like Toby in the manger?\" But there is little\r\nwit and less reason in these booklets to recommend, or to justify aught\r\nbut oblivion.\r\n\r\nA more able and important foe than these was Harry S. Leigh, who in 1864\r\nwas editor of \"The Arrow,\" with Mortimer Collins as verse-writer and\r\nMatt Morgan as cartoonist. Leigh opened his attack with rhymes that were\r\ngreatly enjoyed at the time. They ran thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\nRHYMES FOR A BIG BABY.\r\n\r\n  No. I.\r\n\r\n    \"Sad stuff of Lemon's,\"\r\n  Think the bells of St. Clement's;\r\n    \"Not worth five farthings,\"\r\n  Sneer the bells of St. Martin's;\r\n    \"Going down daily,\"\r\n  Grunt the bells of Old Bailey;\r\n    \"_Once_ it was rich,\"\r\n  Hint the bells of Shoreditch:\r\n    \"When could _that_ be?\"\r\n  Ask the bells of Step-ney;\r\n    \"Hanged if _I_ know,\"\r\n  Growls the big bell at Bow.\r\n\r\n  No. II.\r\n\r\n  Sing a song of threepence,\r\n    A paper full of trash;\r\n  Four-and-twenty \"funny men\"\r\n    Have made a pretty hash;\r\n  For when the paper's opened,\r\n    One soon begins to sing--\r\n  \"Oh! threepence is a dainty price\r\n    To pay for such a thing.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he returns to the charge later on in a set of verses in which he\r\npretends to pay tribute to _Punch's_ bygone force--\"honest if\r\ndelicate\"--and to Judy's and Toby's straightforward roughness. After\r\nmaking charges of corruption, he proceeds:\r\n\r\n  \"Alas! how times and manners pass!\r\n    When no one fears a panic--\r\n  When Scotland tolerates the Mass--\r\n    And Spain is puritanic;\r\n  When Yankee 'anacondas' scrunch\r\n    The South's heroic leader--\r\n  Then may we find a pleasant _Punch_,\r\n    And _Punch_ a happy reader.\"\r\n\r\nNowadays the commoner form of humorous attack upon _Punch_ is the\r\nassumption that it is a serious journal: a cold-blooded analysis of its\r\ncontents will be made, or the quotation of its best bits under the\r\nungrateful title of \"Alleged Humour from _Punch_;\" or a joke will be\r\nprinted and savagely \"quoted\" as \"From _next week's_ PUNCH.\" When the\r\nthree \"New Humorists,\" Messrs. Barry Pain, Jerome, and Zangwill, were\r\ndriven to despair (so says one of them) by the sneers of the Press, they\r\nmet in solemn conclave and swore never to make another joke. So Mr.\r\nZangwill set to work at a serious novel. Mr. Jerome took to editing a\r\nweekly paper, and Mr. Pain _began writing for Punch_! Even when Mr.\r\nPincott, for thirty years the \"reader\" on the paper, committed suicide\r\nthe day after his wife was buried, a number of papers could not resist\r\nthe temptation that was offered. \"Fancy having to read through all\r\n_Punch's_ jokes week after week for years!\" exclaimed one. \"No wonder we\r\nare a hardy race. No wonder the poor man shot himself.\" Mr. Pincott was\r\na man of great ability, of remarkable erudition, and extreme\r\nconscientiousness. Although his bereavement was preying on his mind, he\r\nsaw the paper out, and did not commit the fatal act until he had sent\r\nhis usual letter to the Editor, wherewith he would relieve himself of\r\nhis week's responsibility. \"I never met a man with so much information\r\nand of so varied a character,\" writes one of his fellow-workers. \"He\r\nnever passed a quotation without verifying it, and could give you\r\nchapter and verse for everything. He knew his Shakespeare by heart, and\r\nall the modern poets, and he was never at fault in his classics.\" He was\r\nnot, however, allowed to leave the world without a farewell gibe and a\r\nlaugh, for Wit knows no mercy.\r\n\r\nAnother main charge laid at _Punch's_ door is that he is too little like\r\nHogarth in the past, too little like French satirists in the present.\r\nThackeray's proud boast that the paper had never said aught that could\r\ncause a girl's cheek to mantle with a blush,[26] is acknowledged by the\r\nnaturalist and realist of the day as the severest condemnation that\r\ncould be brought against it. \"We do not want in _Punch_ a moral paper\r\n_virginibus puerisque_,\" says M. Arsène Alexandre, in effect, in his\r\nimportant work \"L'Art du Rire;\" \"_Punch_ is _un peu trop gentleman_.\r\nWhat we want is to be enlightened.\" But _Punch_ has not chosen to cast\r\nthe beams of his search-light on to that side of \"life\" which is turned\r\ntowards vice; and if he determines that the _liaisons_ and all the\r\nattendant world of humour that afford inspiration to the talent of the\r\nGrévins, the Forains, the Guillaumes, and the Willettes of France, are\r\noutside his field of treatment, who shall blame him? If there is any\r\nmoral at all to be gleaned from the work of the _Punch_ caricaturists,\r\nit is argued, it is the never-ending sermon, though the sermon is a\r\nhumorous one, of the non-existence of immorality. Perhaps; but _Punch_\r\ndoes not aspire to reflect the savagery we call civilisation by painting\r\na Hogarthian \"Progress,\" nor to preach virtue by depicting vice. It is\r\nno doubt very appalling and amusing to hear a young girl-cynic say, as\r\nshe points to a hideous monkey in a zoological gardens--\"He only wants a\r\nlittle money to be just like a man!\" _Ça donne à penser_; but _Punch_\r\nprefers wholesome jests to irony and repellent cynicism, and is content\r\nto leave his impeachment in the hands of his spice-loving detractors,\r\neven at the risk of being reminded year by year that \"Gentle Dulness\r\never loves a joke.\"\r\n\r\nAnother fruitful source of adverse criticism is an occasional slip on\r\n_Punch's_ part in respect to some point of fact. Then at once half a\r\ndozen papers are on his track with an eagerness that suggests the idea\r\nthat they were lying in wait. First come the matters of detail, as when\r\nthe \"Athenæum\" (January, 1877) justifiably complained that the popular\r\nconception of the imperial crown of the Empress of India as a\r\nfour-arched structure, like that of Germany, is due to the mistake of\r\n_Punch_, \"whose artists are always falling into this error in their\r\ncartoons of the Empress of India.\" In 1879 Sir John Tenniel was\r\nchallenged by Mr. Sala on the correctness of the balloon in his\r\nfrontispiece to the seventy-sixth volume, and in March, 1893, Mr. du\r\nMaurier was soundly rated for showing a group of Oxford undergraduates,\r\nin the rooms of one of them, wearing cap and gown with perfect docility.\r\nYachtsmen fell foul of Mr. Sambourne for introducing an ensign on a\r\nstaff in his famous drawing of \"The _Times_ Tacking;\" for such a staff,\r\nstuck on the taffrail with the boom touching it, was \"an impossible\r\nobject,\" and would have been instantly snapped off, while, moreover, the\r\nensign should have been at the peak. In another admirable drawing\r\n_Punch_ once showed a ship on the starboard tack while the helmsman is\r\nsteering on the port tack, and the ship, by what appears a miracle, is\r\nlying over to the wind; and, again, Toby is actually shown in the\r\nAlmanac for 1895 drawing a cork from a champagne bottle with a\r\ncork-screw! Then photographers are as resentful of inaccuracy as\r\nbicyclists; and the fact that Mr. Hodgson in the second of his two\r\ndrawings, \"To be well shaken before taken\" (August, 1894), representing\r\nan \"'Arry on 'orseback\" first whipping up his horse before being\r\nphotographed, and then posing before the \"seaside tintype man,\" placed\r\nthe equestrian _between_ the sun and the lens, was warmly taken up; for\r\nwould not the result, forsooth, be \"the loss of the picture in a flare\r\nspot?\"\r\n\r\nThe literary error, too, is held to be inexcusable, and _Punch_ is\r\npointed at with scorn for a misquotation from Horace; or an incorrect\r\nrendering in one of his drawings of an antiquarian inscription; or a\r\nslip in a Shakespearean line; or an inaccuracy in slang or dialect.\r\nScottish, Irish, Suffolk, or Yorkshire must all be perfectly rendered,\r\nor the natives will know the reason why. In August, 1894, Mr. Hodgson\r\nsent from the Yorkshire moors a story of a keeper who, dissatisfied with\r\nthe calendar, replies to a sportsman's inquiries: \"Well, sir, middlin',\r\npretty middlin'. But, oh dear, it's awk'ard this 'ere Twelfth bein'\r\nfixed of a Sunday! Now might Mr. Gladstone ha' had hanything to do wi'\r\nthat arrangement, sir?\" An outraged correspondent--a fluent Yorkshire\r\nconversationalist, of course--at once corrected the original version and\r\ntranslated it into the true vernacular: \"Nobbut middlin', sir, nobbut\r\nmiddlin'. But, ah lad, it's a fond business this puttin' t' Twelfth o' a\r\nSunday. Div ye think 'at owd Gladstone 'ad owt to do wi' it?\" And again\r\n_Punch_ rarely introduces \"mon\" (as an equivalent for \"man\") into his\r\nScotch jokes without producing a disclaimer against this alleged\r\n\"peculiarly British error.\"\r\n\r\nA third form of mistake commonly gloated over is that which touches some\r\ngeneral fact of economics or social matters. An example of this was Mr.\r\nLinley Sambourne's drawing, entitled \"An Embarras de Richesses,\"\r\ngraphically illustrating the glut of money in \"the City\" in the summer\r\nof 1894. The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street is shown standing on a\r\npile of bags of bullion impatiently waving back the City men who are\r\npressing forward with more bags of gold, which bags are labelled\r\n\"Deposits.\" But the Bank of England allows no interest on deposits, as\r\nsuggested by the drawing and its accompanying verses; and the\r\ndraughtsman, explained one of the financial papers which gleefully\r\ncalled attention to the misconception, \"thought it was the Old Lady who\r\nhad reduced her deposit rates to one-half per cent.\"\r\n\r\nBut what are considered the most heinous, as well as the rarest, of all\r\nblunders are those of policy or important movements, which, of course,\r\nconcern large bodies of men, whether they constitute a party, a\r\nconstituency, or a strike. A case in point was the cartoon dedicated\r\n(August, 1893) to the miners on strike in Northumberland and Durham: but\r\nat that particular moment it was the miners of other districts who were\r\nso involved. Another instance was the substitution of Mr. Logan, M.P.,\r\nfor Mr. Leon, M.P. (December, 1893), in a Parliamentary picture that\r\nillustrated an incident mentioned in the \"Essence of Parliament.\" But it\r\nmay be taken that the error was rather a slip than a blunder that\r\nrepresented \"Toby barking up the wrong tree.\"\r\n\r\nIt is natural, of course, that the \"faddists\" should be among Mr.\r\nPunch's most impatient critics, because \"fad\" and \"cant\" have always\r\nbeen _Punch's_ pet ground-game that he loves to run to earth. It is\r\nperhaps from the Temperance party that he has had most sport, for he has\r\nalways taken delight in the pictures they dislike the most--the\r\nincomparable drawings of Leech and Keene, which show the humorous,\r\ninstead of only the hateful, side of inebriety; and he chuckles as he\r\nreads, now their protests against Mr. Bernard Partridge's excruciating\r\npictures of a drunken man's \"progress,\" now the plaintive paragraph that\r\n\"in a recent issue of _Punch_ more than twenty-five per cent. of the\r\nadvertisements concerned hotels, wines, spirits, and mineral waters!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, there is the critic who is always bewailing _Punch's_\r\ndeterioration--an impending dissolution which has been announced from\r\nthe second number!\r\n\r\nPeople in Society seem curiously fond of expressing this opinion to the\r\nmembers of the Staff themselves, if all the stories current are to be\r\nbelieved. \"Well, you know, Mr. Milliken,\" once remarked a lady, \"I do\r\n_not_ think _Punch_ is as good as it _used_ to be.\" \"No,\" assented the\r\ncreator of 'Arry; \"_it never was!_\"\r\n\r\nFor such as these there is and can be no comfort; for them there is no\r\nexcellence save in the past; no inferiority save in the present. The\r\nperusal of humorous papers is of course but a poor occupation for\r\npessimists such as they, and it is hardly likely that it could ever\r\nawaken in them sentiments other than those so tersely put by the\r\n\"Gentlewoman's\" poet:--\r\n\r\n  \"In vain I search for humour each\r\n    And every 'comic' 'neath the sky.\r\n  Alas! I fear the busy Leech\r\n    Has sucked the vein of humour dry!\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] \"Anti-Punch, or the Toy-shop in Fleet Street; a Romance of the\r\nNineteenth Century.\" By the Author of \"Anti-Coningsby.\" 16mo. 1847.\r\n\r\n[26] This declaration, if not absolutely accurate, has often been\r\nrepeated, and was confirmed at the Church Congress of 1893 by Dr.\r\nWelldon, who held up _Punch_ as the one clean paper for the rest of the\r\nPress to follow!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING AND PRINTING.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Joseph Swain supersedes Ebenezer Landells--His Education as\r\n     Engraver--Head of His Department--Engraving the Big Cut: Then and\r\n     Now--Printing from the Wood-blocks--Leech's\r\n     Fastidiousness--Impracticability of Keene--Thackeray's Little\r\n     Confidence--A Record of Half a Century.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH SWAIN.]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1843 that Mr. Swain engraved his first block for _Punch_. It\r\nwas a drawing by Leech, on p. 50 of the fourth volume, to illustrate one\r\nof Albert Smith's \"Side-Scenes of Society.\" The services of Landells, it\r\nwill be remembered, had been suddenly dispensed with by the\r\nproprietors--for reasons of business jealousy according to Landells,\r\nthough the proprietors gave out, in some quarters at least, for lack of\r\nproper excellence in his work. When they had decided to give Landells\r\nhis _congé_, Bradbury and Evans looked about for another to replace him,\r\nand offered the engraving to one of the brothers Jewett. By him the task\r\nwas readily undertaken, although he was, as he knew, wholly unable to\r\ncarry it out; and when a block with one of Leech's drawings upon it was\r\nsent to him as a test, he offered the execution of it to his young\r\nacquaintance, Joseph Swain. So pleased was Leech with the result that he\r\nstrongly recommended that the man who had cut such a block should, in\r\nplace of the middleman, be installed as manager of the engraving\r\ndepartment; and from that time forward that important portion of the\r\nwork has remained in the hands of one of _Punch's_ most faithful, loyal,\r\nand talented servants, of whom _Punch_ has happily had so many.\r\n\r\nMr. Swain had been brought up by his father from Oxford, his natal\r\ntown, when he was nine years of age, and five years later had been\r\nplaced with N. Whittock, a draughtsman of Islington, to learn the art\r\nand craft of wood-cutting. But though Mr. Whittock was something of an\r\nartist, he was less of an engraver; and finding after a few years that\r\nhe was making but little progress, young Swain applied for instruction\r\nto Thomas Williams. That distinguished engraver was one of the few\r\nexcellent \"facsimile men\" of the day; and he agreed to accept the\r\napplicant as \"improver.\" At that time he was engaged in engraving the\r\nblocks of an edition of \"Paul et Virginie\"--the well-known illustrated\r\nedition which was published in Paris in 1838. For at that time there\r\nwere fewer facsimile engravers in Paris than in London, and what there\r\nwere, in point of ability, were not to be compared with the Englishmen;\r\nso that it was no uncommon thing for the best work to be sent from\r\nFrance to be executed in this country. On this particular work\r\nMeissonier, Johannot, Horace Vernet, and others had been engaged; and\r\nwhen that was finished, the series of works published by Charles Knight\r\nprovided endless work for the skilled gravers at Williams' command:\r\nHarvey's \"Arabian Nights,\" \"Shakespeare,\" and the \"History of Greece,\"\r\nand other notable works. It was a great school of engravers that existed\r\nthen, both of masters and pupils, and included, besides Thomas Williams\r\nhimself, his brother and sister, Samuel and Mary Ann Williams (a\r\nbrilliant engraver she, who never gained her due of reputation), John\r\nThompson, Orrin Smith, W. J. Linton, John Jackson, Mason Jackson, W. T.\r\nGreene, Robert Branston, Landells, the Dalziel Brothers,[27] and Edmund\r\nEvans. Most of them were soon employed by W. Dickes, under whose\r\nmanagement the Abbotsford edition of Scott's works was being executed;\r\nand to Dickes, Joseph Swain also transferred his services. In due course\r\nthe young engraver left that establishment, and had not long been on\r\nthe look-out for a satisfactory opening when he received from Jewett the\r\nlittle commission which landed him in a very short time in the service\r\nof _Punch_, in which he remained until he retired from business in\r\nfavour of his son, after a completed period of half a century.\r\n\r\nFor some years Mr. Swain remained at the head of the _Punch_ engraving\r\ndepartment, devoting himself, and his six or eight assistants,\r\nexclusively to _Punch_ work. He then pointed out to the proprietors how,\r\nby conducting and extending the business on his own account, he could\r\ncarry out their work more economically while increasing his own field of\r\noperations and doubling his earning powers. The suggestion was acted\r\nupon, and the result proved satisfactory to both parties. For by this\r\ntime he had educated the necessary engravers to that style of facsimile\r\ncutting in which he himself, and but few besides, had been specially\r\ntrained, and he was enabled to keep the weekly expense of engraving\r\n_Punch_ down to an average of under thirty pounds, and at the same time\r\nto spend his superfluous energies on many of the most famous illustrated\r\nbooks of his day.\r\n\r\nFor many years the boxwood blocks on which the drawings were made\r\nconsisted of a single piece; for, as already explained, Charles Wells of\r\nBouverie Street, at first a cabinetmaker of rare excellence, and later\r\non a boxwood importer, had not then invented the device which\r\nrevolutionised newspaper illustration--that of making a block in six or\r\nmore sections which could be taken apart after the drawing had been made\r\n(and later on photographed) upon its surface and distributed among the\r\nengravers, and then screwed together again when each man had completed\r\nhis own little piece. The invention which led to such an economy of time\r\nwas only introduced in 1860 or thereabouts. For nineteen years _Punch_\r\nhad to see his big blocks cut on a single piece of wood, which was one\r\nof the reasons why the earlier cartoons and \"pencillings\" were, as a\r\nrule, so much more roughly drawn and hastily cut. In those early days a\r\nsingle \"round\" of wood was used--a \"round\" that had been cross-cut from\r\nthe trunk of the tree. This was always kept seasoning until by natural\r\nshrinkage it had split up to the centre, when a tongue-shaped piece of\r\nbox was fitted into the triangular vacancy and screwed firmly through.\r\nThen the block was squared as well as its shape permitted, and when its\r\nsurface had been properly prepared, it was ready for the artist.\r\n\r\nAs I find myself discussing technical details in _Punch_ production, it\r\nmay be well to go a step further, for such matters can hardly fail to\r\ninterest the reader. The cartoon, for reasons of economy of time, has\r\nalways, up to 1893, been drawn upon the wood[28]--not upon paper, as has\r\nbeen possible to the rest of the Staff for a good many years past--and\r\nis delivered into Mr. Swain's hands by Friday night. Twenty-four hours\r\nlater the engraving of the block is completed, and it is handed over to\r\nthe printers, who are already clamouring for it to be put in their\r\nformes--for there is no time to electrotype it, nor of course to\r\nstereotype the pages. Stereotyping, indeed, has been the latest of the\r\ninnovations on _Punch_--an innovation to be reckoned but a year or two\r\nold--for _Punch_, in his own house at least, is a Conservative among\r\nConservatives. What was always present in the publisher's mind was that\r\nthe \"foreign edition\" had to be ready printed off by Monday morning, and\r\nevery moment was necessarily grudged during which the machines were not\r\nrunning--even those few short minutes when a sheet or two of the paper,\r\nat first starting, were taken to Mr. Swain to be judged as to the\r\nprinting of the cuts, or as to whether they wanted a little more\r\n\"colour,\" or a little pressure taken off. \"To myself,\" Mr. Swain tells\r\nme, \"it has always been a pleasing reflection that during the whole time\r\nof my connection with _Punch_, extending over fifty years, I have never\r\nonce failed to get my work done in time and without accident. Of course,\r\nnow and again it has been a very near thing, but it has always been done\r\nsomehow.\"\r\n\r\nIt has ever been matter for surprise to outsiders that the conductors of\r\nthe journal could tempt Fate so recklessly as to put the original\r\nwood-blocks on the machines. As has been seen, there was no\r\nalternative. But the fact remains that they ran a continual risk for\r\nfifty years which no other journal would care to face for a single week;\r\nfor an accident to a single block (and such accidents are all too\r\ncommon) would have jeopardised the whole week's edition, as no other\r\noriginal existed (as it exists nowadays) from which the damaged block\r\nmight be reproduced, or by which it might be superseded.\r\n\r\nSo it was only after the printing of an edition that the blocks were\r\nelectrotyped. It is a curious fact that after 70,000 or 80,000 had been\r\nprinted these blocks were nearly always found as good as new so far as\r\nthe wood was concerned; only towards the end of the edition the blocks\r\nwould sometimes get so filled up that some of the fine work was entirely\r\nlost, and the electros then taken suffered in consequence. An\r\nexamination of this substance would show that it consisted of lime and\r\npulp from the paper itself, compressed in a solid body so hard that it\r\nalmost defied the graver to remove it.\r\n\r\nThose early days were halcyon times for _Punch_ engravers. Mark Lemon\r\nwould come down two or three times a week to edit and make up the paper,\r\nand would talk leisurely with Mr. Swain of such matters as concerned the\r\nengraver. No block was hurried. If it could not be ready for one week,\r\nit was held over for the next--a saving grace which the engraver has now\r\nand again acknowledged by drawing an initial or other simple design on\r\nthe wood half an hour before going to press, when the Editor hurriedly\r\nrequired such a decoration--possibly to supply an artist's omission.\r\nSuch sketches were \"The Cabman's Ticket\" in February, 1854, put upon the\r\nwood from a scribble by Gilbert à Beckett--his sole artistic\r\ncontribution to _Punch_; \"Broom _v._ Brush\" in May, 1859; and \"The\r\nTurkish Bath\" in 1880. And, above all, \"process\" had not yet held out\r\nits alluring promise of nearly equal results, to the inexpert eye, at a\r\nquarter of the cost of wood-engraving.\r\n\r\nIn another way did Mr. Swain place his mark on the pages of _Punch_--by\r\nthe introduction of many a young artist to the Editor. It was he who\r\nthus introduced Mr. T. Harrington Wilson to Mark Lemon, Mr. Ralston to\r\nShirley Brooks, R. B. Wallace (whose acquaintance he had made through\r\nMr. Frederick Shields) and Mr. Wheeler to Tom Taylor, and others, too,\r\nto the various rulers of _Punch_. In some cases the artists themselves\r\napproached the engraver; in others, it was the Editor who would ask him\r\nto recommend some clever designer who could best execute this or that\r\nlittle drawing which he wanted done. Further service rendered by him was\r\nthe share he took in educating several of _Punch's_ more imposing\r\npersonages for the work they had to do--such as Doyle, McDonnell, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIt has often been quoted of Leech that after he had shown a drawing on\r\nthe wood to any friend who might happen to be with him, he would add\r\nwith a sigh--\"But wait till next week and see how the engraver will\r\nspoil it!\" This was a piece of unintentional injustice, for the fault\r\nlay with the conditions of rapid printing (for _Punch_ has always been,\r\nand still is, printed on a cylinder machine)--with the printer, the\r\nink-maker, and the paper manufacturer more than with the engraver, as a\r\nglance at the proofs of the engravings will show.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this matter, Dean Hole says: \"If the position of an eyelash\r\nwas altered, or the curve of a lip was changed, there might be an ample\r\nremainder to convey the intention and to win the admiration of those who\r\nnever knew their loss, but the _perfection_ of the original was gone.\r\nAgain and again I have heard him [Leech] sigh as he looked over the new\r\nnumber of _Punch_; and as I, seeing but excellence, would ask an\r\nexplanation, he would point to some almost imperceptible obliquity which\r\nvexed his gentle soul.\" It is a curious fact that, in common with most\r\ndraughtsmen, Leech never became reconciled to the fact that black\r\nprinter's-ink cannot exactly render the tender grey tones of a hard lead\r\npencil; but to the fact that he had not much to complain of Mr. Frith\r\nbears witness: \"I once saw one of Leech's drawings on the wood, and I\r\nafterwards saw it in _Punch_, and I remember wondering at the fidelity\r\nwith which it was rendered. Some of the lines, finer than the finest\r\nhair, had been cut away or _thickened_, but the character, the vigour,\r\nand the beauty were scarcely damaged.\" In connection with this subject\r\nMr. Layard, in his \"Life of Charles Keene,\" compared a photogravure and\r\na wood-block of one of the _Punch_ pictures, with the principal, though\r\nunintended, result of proving how indulgent are wood-engraving and the\r\ntool of the skilled craftsman to the artist who inconsiderately persists\r\nin using grey inks of varying intensities and subtle lines of indefinite\r\nthicknesses on paper of various colour-patches, when reproduction upon\r\nwood is his sole ultimate aim.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Swain lived for some time close to Thackeray's house, it was an\r\noccasional custom of his to call on his way to the office to see if the\r\ngreat \"Thack\" had any blocks ready that he might carry away with him.\r\nThe novelist was usually at breakfast when he called, and would request\r\nthat his visitor might be shown into the library. There he would\r\npresently join him and, if he were behindhand with his work, would\r\nrequest Mr. Swain to have a seat, a cigar, and a chat, while he produced\r\na _Punch_ drawing \"while you wait.\" \"Ah, Swain!\" he said one day,\r\nlooking up from his block, when he was more than usually confidential,\r\n\"if it had not been for _Punch_, I wonder where I should be!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Swain retired in 1890 from the business he had formed, and\r\nhanded it over to his son, who had been many years identified with it,\r\nand still continues the weekly engraving of the _Punch_ cartoon.\r\nWood-engraving has now been abandoned for all other illustrations, the\r\nfirst process block tried on the paper being Mr. Linley Sambourne's\r\ndrawing called \"Reconciliation, a scene from the new screaming farce,\r\nthe 'Political Box and Cox,'\" on the 3rd December, 1892 (p. 273); but\r\nthat the innovation has been equally happy in the case of every artist I\r\nam not prepared to maintain.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] Mr. George Dalziel writes to me: \"For myself I was somewhat\r\nintimately connected with the publication from its birth; being\r\nassociated with Landells as an engraver, it fell to my lot to engrave\r\n... the first drawing contributed by John Leech, under the title of\r\n'Foreign Affairs,' with many of the cartoons by Kenny Meadows, as well\r\nas many of the drawings of every artist engaged upon the journal, so\r\nlong as Landells had anything to do with _Punch_.\"\r\n\r\n[28] With the exception of the Almanac cartoon, for which the engraver\r\nhas ample time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n_PUNCH'S_ WRITERS: 1841.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mark Lemon--As Others Saw Him--His Duties--His Industry--His Staff\r\n     and their Apportioned Work--Lemon as an Editor--And Diplomatist--A\r\n     Testimonial--And a Practical Joke--Henry Mayhew--His Great Powers\r\n     and Little Weaknesses--Disappointment and Retirement--Stirling\r\n     Coyne--Gilbert Abbott à Beckett--His Early Career--Tremendous\r\n     Industry--À Beckett and Robert Seymour--Appointed\r\n     Magistrate--Locked In--Angus B.

However, he had found financial salvation; for\r\nalthough his playwriting had not been unsuccessful--and by the time he\r\ndied his pieces were to be numbered by the score--the drama in the days\r\nof short runs was not a remunerative form of literature. His natural\r\n_bonhomie_ stood him in good stead; it charmed his friends and\r\nnon-plussed his enemies. Of the latter, it must be admitted, he had more\r\nthan enough--or, at least, men to whom he was intensely antipathetic.\r\nOne eminent journalist--more eminent than Mark himself--writes him down\r\n\"a mealy-mouthed sycophant;\" and another, hardly less popular, went\r\nfurther still in his denunciation, and, if he were to be believed, Mark\r\nLemon must have been one of the most accomplished humbugs of his time.\r\n\"There was nothing good about Mark,\" said a distinguished draughtsman,\r\nwho worked with the _Punch_ Editor for many a long year, \"but his\r\nlaugh.\" But against this criticism--which was that of men whose judgment\r\nought to be clear and sound, and was, moreover, shared by others--there\r\nis an overwhelming mass of evidence in favour of Lemon's extreme\r\namiability, kindness, and geniality. He, naturally, was the butt of\r\nrival comic papers, who would taunt him with his Jewish descent, with\r\nthe mildness of his jokes and humour, and the bitterness of his false\r\nfriendship. A favourite form was to print among supposed \"Births\" such a\r\nline as this: \"On Wednesday, the 26th ult., at Whitefriars, Mr. Mark\r\nLemon, of a joke, stillborn.\"\r\n\r\nBut Lemon could well afford to ignore all such attacks. Mr. George\r\nChester, his life-long friend, pronounced him the prince of cronies, and\r\nI have seen many letters from him instinct with affection and jovial\r\nhumour. One of them, by the way, gives information that \"our nursemaid\r\nhas the chicken-pock, and we expect to see her throw out feathers\r\nto-morrow.\" When he entered the composing-room he was invariably\r\nreceived with a cheer by the men, whom he called \"my Caxtonian Bees.\"\r\nCharles Dickens believed in him as \"a most affectionate and true-hearted\r\nfellow,\" and so described him to Sir A. H. Layard (in whose interest\r\nDickens arranged for Tenniel's fine \"Nineveh Bull\" cartoon to be\r\npublished); and though he quarrelled with him, because Lemon had the\r\ncourage, chivalry, and uprightness to take Mrs. Dickens's side against\r\nher husband, he brought the estrangement to a close with a kindly\r\nmessage when Lemon first appeared as Falstaff. Mr. Joseph Hatton carries\r\nhis friendly admiration almost to the point of Lemonolatry; and the man\r\nwho could inspire such friendship must assuredly have been endowed with\r\nsterling qualities and with a lovable nature.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lemon impressed me,\" writes Mr. E. J. Ellis, \"as the kindest and\r\nmost lovable elderly boy I had ever seen. He evidently accepted my\r\nlittle sketches only for the promise, not the performance, of them. Some\r\nwere rejected. This was done so genially that I found myself hastening\r\nto refuse my own drawings for him rather than put him to the effort of\r\nsparing my feelings while doing so. 'Here I sit,' he said, 'like a\r\ngreat ogre, eating up people's little hopes.' Then he showed me his\r\nwaste-paper basket, and added--'But what am I to do? Look here!' I\r\nconfess I never saw, except on pavement in coloured chalks, such\r\nnerve-twisting horrors as the paper sketches people sent.\" It is obvious\r\nfrom this that the writer never watched the pictures entering the Royal\r\nAcademy on Sending-in Day.\r\n\r\nMark Lemon loved _Punch_; as well he ought. He refused to visit America\r\nto give his readings on terms that were highly alluring, as he could not\r\nfind it in his heart to abandon the command, even for a time, nor bear\r\nto miss his two days a week at Whitefriars. When he said truly that he\r\nand _Punch_ were made for each other, and that he \"would not have\r\nsucceeded in any other way,\" he might fairly have added, had he wished,\r\nhow hard he had laboured for that success. Mr. Birket Foster has drawn\r\nme a vivid picture of how in those early days he had to visit Lemon in\r\nhis Newcastle Street lodgings, and, mounting to the topmost storey,\r\nfound him in an untidy, undusted room, sitting in his shirt-sleeves,\r\nwith Horace Mayhew by his side plying the scissors, working at the\r\nweekly \"make-up\" of _Punch_ with the desperate eagerness that was, in\r\ntime, to bear so rich a harvest.\r\n\r\nHow Mark Lemon helped to bring together the original Staff has already\r\nbeen seen. It was, doubtless, his sound display of business capacity and\r\ncharacter, in addition to his literary aptitude, that induced Henry\r\nMayhew and Landells to nominate him as one of the co-editors--for that\r\nwas a quality in which both Henry Mayhew and Stirling Coyne were\r\nconfessedly deficient. \"There are forty men of wit,\" says Swift, \"for\r\none man of sense.\" So the paper was started, and the very first article,\r\n\"The Moral of _Punch_,\" was Lemon's;[29] but neither then nor after did\r\nhe write much for it, though he still contributed a certain amount of\r\ngraceful, serious verse, under the title of \"Songs for the Sentimental,\"\r\nwith a farcical last line which affects the reader suddenly like a cold\r\ndouche. He wrote, as well, many short epigrams, paragraphs, and the\r\nlike, besides being a fairly prolific suggestor of the cartoons; but the\r\nsum of his literary labours on the paper would not compare with that of\r\nthe members on the Staff. To him fell the organisation, administration,\r\nand practical making-up of the paper.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of _Punch_, during those infantile convulsions to\r\nwhich the paper threatened to succumb, Mark Lemon assured his position\r\nby the great zeal with which he carried out his duties; and at the\r\ntransfer of _Punch_ he was left sole Editor, by the fiat of the new\r\nproprietors. Stirling Coyne left without real regret, though in\r\nconsiderable dudgeon at his treatment; he had many other irons in the\r\nfire, and the conditions of journal-weaning were unattractive to him.\r\nBut to Henry Mayhew it was a bitter disappointment. It was he who had\r\nmade _Punch_ what it was; he found himself ousted from his legitimate\r\nposition, and he considered, in his own words, that Mark Lemon \"had\r\nallowed himself to be bought over,\" so that a coolness sprang up between\r\nthe two men which was never quite removed.\r\n\r\nIn his work Lemon did not spare himself. For a time Horace Mayhew was\r\nhis sub-editor, to whom fell the usual duties of the post--(\"Be it\r\nyours,\" as a careless speaker in the office nicknamed \"Heavens!\" is\r\ntraditionally said to have advised, \"Be it yours, 'Orace, to hurge the\r\nhartises [artists] hon!\")--but before long Lemon took that duty upon\r\nhimself, driving round to the chief contributors one day in the week to\r\nsatisfy himself that their drawings and \"copy\" would be to time. The\r\nstory goes that he always employed the same driver, and that when the\r\nman was about to replace the old vehicle with a new one, he suggested to\r\nLemon, with glowing pride at the brightness of the idea, that he should\r\nhave a figure of _Punch_ emblazoned on the panels. In later years\r\nLemon's son Harry acted as his secretary, and sometimes, though\r\nunofficially, as his sub-editor, and generally undertook the\r\n\"travelling\" for his father.\r\n\r\nIt was in Lombard Street, Whitefriars, of classic memory, that Bradbury\r\nand Evans carried on the practical part of their business; and here Mark\r\nLemon might often be seen, radiant and effulgent as the circulation\r\nrose. In May,1843, _Punch_ had removed from Wellington Street, Strand,\r\nto 194, Strand, an office which he gave up to his young rival, \"The\r\nGreat Gun,\" in January, 1845, in order to remove to 92, Fleet Street.\r\nHere he only remained for a couple of months, and, migrating in March of\r\nthe same year, he set up for good and all in 85, Fleet Street, on the\r\nvery site in St. Bride's Churchyard of the tailor's house where Milton\r\nonce kept school. In the editorial office the _Punch_ Staff would often\r\nwrite their articles, Thackeray especially taking advantage of the\r\nconvenience. \"In three hours more,\" he wrote to Mrs. Brookfield in 1850,\r\n\"Mr. W. M. T. is hard at work at _Punch_ office.\"\r\n\r\nThe management of the weekly \"copy,\" the arrangement for series, and the\r\ndealing with outside applications of all sorts, quite apart from\r\nartistic contributions, were together no light task for the Editor,\r\nespecially when one or other of the writers failed him, and the\r\nillustrations that were to accompany their articles had to be retaken\r\ninto consideration. From the beginning outside contributions were\r\nremorselessly discouraged; yet some remarkable poems and sketches have\r\ncome to _Punch_ unsolicited from famous and brilliant pens, as will\r\nsubsequently be seen. Still, the paper has always been a fairly close\r\nborough--as, after all, it has a perfect right to be; and by that means\r\nhas been enabled to keep its distinctive colour--in contrast with the\r\n\"Fliegende Blätter,\" for example, whose staff may truly be said to\r\nconsist of the whole German people. To each writer was allotted a\r\ncertain space, which he was expected to fill; and when there was a\r\ndeficit in the amount of his contribution--which there generally was,\r\nand a heavy one--it was duly entered up. Thus for a long while Douglas\r\nJerrold's half-yearly total was theoretically 162 columns (or a weekly\r\naverage of six and a quarter); Gilbert à Beckett's, 135 columns (five\r\nand a quarter); Percival Leigh's, Tom Taylor's, and Horace Mayhew's, 54;\r\nand Thackeray's, 46 columns; but few of them ever came up to their\r\nproper total. In earlier days, before Albert Smith left, the following\r\nwere the weekly tasks: Jerrold, five columns; Gilbert à Beckett, four;\r\nSmith and Leigh, two each; and after Smith's departure à Beckett\r\nsucceeded to Jerrold's figures.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Staff's contributions were kept as follows, their\r\nrelative proportions being exactly shown. I take one volume at random,\r\nthe seventh, that for the second half-year of 1844:--\r\n\r\n  -------------+------+------+-------+------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n               |      |      |       |      |       |       |Total  |\r\n               |      |      |Septem-|Octo- |Novem- |Decem- |of Six |Weekly\r\n  Contributors | July |August|  ber  | ber  | ber   | ber   |Months |Average\r\n  -------------+------+------+-------+------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n  Douglas      |      |      |       |      |       |       |       |\r\n    Jerrold    |20-1/4|17-1/4| 23-1/2|27[30]| 20-1/4| 31-1/2|139-3/4| 5-1/4\r\n  Gilbert      |      |      |       |      |       |       |       |\r\n    à Beckett  |15-1/4|18    |  6-1/2|17-1/4| 17    | 19-3/4| 94-3/4| 3-1/2\r\n  Percival     |      |      |       |      |       |       |       |\r\n    Leigh      | 4-1/2| 8-3/4|  9    |  5   |  5-1/2|  6-1/4| 39    | 1-1/2\r\n  Thackeray    | 8    | 5-3/4|  6    |  --  |   --  |  4-3/4| 24-1/2| 1\r\n  Horace Mayhew| 2-1/2| 2-1/2|  3-1/2|  2   |  2-1/2|  3-3/4| 16-3/4|   1/2\r\n  T.

In\r\naddition to these names during the period covered by the table, there\r\nmay be added those of Tom Hood (3-3/4), T. J. Serle, Charles Lever,\r\nHorace Smith, and Doyle.\r\n\r\nAnother source of trouble to the Editor was the holiday-time as it came\r\nround, for the Staff would scatter itself and, though arrangements were\r\nmade of course beforehand, the paper was sometimes run in a\r\ncuriously undermanned condition. Thus, for example, on the week of\r\nAugust 12, 1848 (No. 370), Jerrold was at Guernsey, Thackeray was at\r\nBrussels, Horace Mayhew at Ramsgate, and Tom Taylor away on circuit. The\r\nwhole paper was in consequence written by three men--by Gilbert à\r\nBeckett and Percival Leigh at home, and by Horace Mayhew, who\r\nthoughtfully sent in more than four columns from the country, so that\r\nhis absence should not be felt.\r\n\r\n  AMOUNT OF TEXT (IN COLUMNS) CONTRIBUTED BY THE WRITERS INDICATED FROM\r\n  VOL.

PUNCH'S FANCY BALL.\r\n\r\n_Reduced from the Double-page Cartoon by John Leech (1847), showing the\r\nStaff of \"Punch\" as Orchestra._ (See next page.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. NEWMAN. RICHARD DOYLE. JOHN LEECH. W. M. THACKERAY.\r\nHORACE MAYHEW. MARK LEMON. PERCIVAL LEIGH. GILBERT À BECKETT. TOM\r\nTAYLOR. DOUGLAS JERROLD.\r\n\r\n(_Detail of Portraits of the Staff in \"Mr. Punch's Fancy Ball.\"_)]\r\n\r\nAt no time was Lemon's position an easy one, for his team, brilliant as\r\nit was, was sometimes wont to jib, and even to kick over the traces, or,\r\nmost serious of all, to fall ill; whereupon the fountain of inspiration\r\nand supply would immediately dry up. When one failed, another would have\r\nto be made to fill the space; and all the while susceptibilities had to\r\nbe nursed and respected as carefully as the well-being of the paper.\r\nThackeray would now and then send a letter of apology instead of his\r\n\"copy,\" and Jerrold would fail for a week or two together; and then\r\nGilbert à Beckett with important contributions, and Horace Mayhew with a\r\nmass of little ones, were the men who, in the early volumes, would rush\r\nquickly to the rescue. Lemon was patience itself--he had no alternative\r\nperhaps--and could humour his Staff just as their humour demanded, for\r\nhe was a born diplomatist as well as editor. Moreover, he had an\r\nunerring instinct as to what should and what should not appear in the\r\npaper; not alone on the ground of \"good taste,\" as it was then\r\nunderstood, but of public feeling. This invaluable quality was\r\nacknowledged by the rest of the Staff, and was probably the secret of\r\nLemon's ability to retain his position so long and with so much dignity,\r\nand to impose his will--_suaviter in modo_ as was his habit--on men who\r\nwould brook such imposition from no one else. It was his moral balance\r\nthey admired--that judgment which in all his long career of satiric\r\ncriticism kept him practically free from any action for libel after he\r\nhad taken his share in piloting the paper through its sea of early\r\ntroubles. He was watchful and discriminating, both as regards the\r\ncontents of the paper and the discussions at the board--where he would\r\nsmooth over such an occasional storm as might threaten, and be deaf to\r\nanything that a less skilful tactician than himself might have taken\r\nnotice of. Nevertheless, Lemon could take his own part if occasion\r\nrequired, and face his opponents with all the vigour of his authority.\r\nThe Proprietors themselves once felt the strength of his character when\r\nthey sought to challenge him on a vital point. Mark Lemon quickly\r\nassured himself of the support of his Staff, and, rising from his seat,\r\nhe said in a tone of command, \"Boys, follow me!\" and made to leave the\r\nroom. The struggle was over, and Lemon triumphed. Similarly did he make\r\na _casus belli_ of the attempt of the Proprietors on his editorial\r\nrights and dignity, when he was requested to appear at their meeting\r\ninstead of their attending in his room. And he went so far as to instal\r\nhimself in a room on the other side of the way until his point was\r\nconceded. He was, on the whole, a consummate Editor, who could cater for\r\nall men, and yet keep his pages practically clean and irreproachable,\r\nand almost free from blunder; all the while enlisting for it more and\r\nmore of popular sympathy, and daily increasing its influence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LID OF THE INKSTAND PRESENTED TO MARK LEMON BY THE\r\nMEMBERS OF HIS STAFF IN 1845.]\r\n\r\n_Punch_ did not engage his exclusive energies. He was the first editor\r\nof the \"Field.\" Then he edited the \"London Journal,\" and in trying to\r\nimprove its tone and quality of literature by the republication in its\r\npages of the Waverley novels he well-nigh ruined it. These and other\r\nmatters he embarked upon, together with a number of small works, such as\r\nhis volume of \"Prose and Verse\" (which Jerrold said ought to have been\r\ncalled \"Prose and Worse\"), and his \"Jest Book,\" on the strength of\r\nwhich, it is said, Hans Christian Andersen, when in England, sought an\r\nintroduction to him and paid him the compliment of saying, \"I am so glad\r\nto know you, Mr. Lemon--you are so full of comic!\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, Lemon acted as a sort of secretary to Herbert Ingram, whom he\r\nserved with great tact. Ingram was a good deal identified with the\r\n_Punch_ circle, sometimes in a friendly and sometimes in a hostile way.\r\nHe was owner, before he sold it to William and Robert Brough, of \"The\r\nMan in the Moon,\" _Punch's_ arch-enemy, and in later years he started\r\nthe \"Comic News,\" with Edmund Yates as editor, on purpose to oppose\r\nhim. Yet several of the _Punch_ men, notably Shirley Brooks, worked on\r\nhis \"Illustrated London News,\" which was started in great measure to\r\npush \"Parr's Life Pills\" (these were constantly mentioned and sometimes\r\nattacked in _Punch_), and Douglas Jerrold found in him the capitalist\r\nfor the \"Illuminated Magazine.\" Mark Lemon it was who took several of\r\nhis Staff down to Boston to speak for Ingram during his candidature, an\r\nexpedition that was a greater electoral than oratorical success; and he\r\nagain it was, so it is said, who persuaded Mr. Ingram to drop the \"Comic\r\nNews,\" so that _Punch_ might be rid of what was already a troublesome,\r\nand might have become a very damaging, rival.\r\n\r\nWith equal zeal and skill and genial friendliness to recommend him,\r\nLemon became a great favourite in his own circle, for \"Uncle Mark\" was\r\nalways ready to do his friends a good turn. In 1845 the Staff combined\r\nto present him with a silver inkstand--an interesting relic now in\r\npossession of Mrs. F. W. W. Topham, his daughter--a reproduction of the\r\nlid of which is here given; while the locket which, with a more\r\nsubstantial gift, was presented in 1866 to celebrate the Jubilee of\r\n_Punch_ (_i.e._ his fiftieth volume) and to mark the withdrawal of the\r\nHeads of the firm, was inscribed as follows: \"To Mark Lemon from his old\r\nfriends W. Bradbury and F. M. Evans, on their retirement, given at a\r\ndinner at Maidenhead, June 27th, 1866. Present--W. H. Bradbury, Shirley\r\nBrooks, Wm. Agnew, G. du Maurier, F. C. Burnand, J. H. Agnew, C. H.\r\nBennett, John Tenniel, Horace Mayhew, F. M. Evans (Jim.), Henry Silver,\r\nT. Agnew (Jim.), Percival Leigh, Chas. Keene, Mark Lemon, Wm. Bradbury,\r\nF. M. Evans.\" There is no doubt that, as time went on, Lemon became more\r\nand more popular with his Staff, and each fresh appearance in _Punch_ of\r\nhis jolly face under the low-crowned hat of John Bull, or the\r\nsnow-sprinkled peak of Father Christmas, identified him more closely\r\nwith the paper and endeared him to his workers. Yet they liked to \"score\r\noff\" him when they could, in return for the jokes he played on them. The\r\nstory is told how, when he had run down for a few days' holiday by the\r\nsea, he received the paper by post, and, tearing off its cover, was\r\nhorrified to find, not the cartoon they had agreed upon, but another,\r\nexecrable in taste and vile in execution, while undoubted libels and\r\nother offences were sprinkled with hideous liberality about the pages.\r\nMoreover, the cartoon was awry, the date was wrong, and a paragraph was\r\nupside down. Lemon turned cold all down his spine, and gasping \"This\r\ncomes from my being away!\" he determined to return to town without the\r\nloss of a moment. From this point historians differ. Some say that Mark\r\nrushed to the station, quickly bought up every copy of the awful issue\r\nthat was for sale, and jumped into the railway-carriage with the bundle;\r\nand that not before he was well on his way did he dare to open a copy to\r\ngaze again on the hideous production; and when he did--he rubbed his\r\neyes, for everything was just as it should be! Then the light broke in\r\nupon him that he had been egregiously \"sold,\" and he realised that a\r\ncopy had been specially prepared for his pleasing edification! Other\r\ncommentators assert that before Uncle Mark had time to leave for the\r\nstation a telegram came, mercifully explaining a joke which, it was\r\nfelt, ought not to be carried too far. The reader will remember a\r\nsimilar incident occurring in \"Esmond;\" and one wonders if the idea of\r\nthat dummy copy of the \"Spectator\" was not suggested by the hour's\r\ntorture lovingly inflicted upon the Editor of _Punch_ by his\r\naffectionate and respectful Staff.\r\n\r\nMark Lemon died on May 23rd, 1870. He had been very ill on one or two\r\nprevious occasions; even as early as 1848 Jerrold had written to John\r\nForster that \"Lemon has been at Death's door--but has kept on the\r\noutside.\" For nine-and-twenty years he had been at the helm; and\r\nalthough he may not have been as paramount on _Punch_ as some aver,\r\nthere can be no doubt that he entirely merited the compliment paid by\r\nMr. Gladstone to his memory when, awarding a pension of £100 from the\r\nCivil List to Mrs. Lemon, he said that he had \"raised the level of comic\r\njournalism to its present standard.\" The proprietors, with generous\r\nsympathy, recognising the immense services of their friend, at once set\r\nabout making a collection for the widow and unmarried daughters (for\r\nLemon had been unsuccessful in his investments and speculations) and,\r\nwith the ready help of the Staff, prosecuted it with so much energy and\r\ngoodwill that the sum of £1,500 was quickly raised.\r\n\r\nHe was lowered to rest in a coffin simply inscribed \"Mark Lemon--Editor\r\nof _Punch_;\" for in _Punch_ he had lived his life. \"He believed,\" said\r\nMr. Hatton, \"in one God, one woman, one publication,\" as his surviving\r\ncolleagues well knew. \"If this journal,\" they wrote by the hand of\r\nShirley Brooks, \"has had the good fortune to be credited with habitual\r\nadvocacy of truth and justice, if it has been praised for abstinence\r\nfrom the less worthy kind of satire, if it has been trusted by those who\r\nkeep guard over the purity of womanhood and of youth, we, the best\r\nwitnesses, turn for a moment from our sorrow to bear the fullest and\r\nmost willing testimony that the high and noble spirit of Mark Lemon ever\r\nprompted generous championship, ever made unworthy onslaught or\r\nirreverent jest impossible to the pens of those who were honoured in\r\nbeing coadjutors with him.\" And in the poem that follows, testimony is\r\nborne that--\r\n\r\n  \"... 'Twas his pride to teach us so to bear\r\n    Our blades, as he bore his--keep the edge keen,\r\n  But strike above the belt: and ever wear\r\n    The armour of a conscience clear and clean.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY MAYHEW.\r\n\r\n_From a Photograph by Bedford, Lemere and Co., Strand, W.C._]\r\n\r\nThe character of Henry Mayhew, and his share in the production of\r\n_Punch_, have already been somewhat fully set forth. An old friend of\r\nhis informs me that \"he was lovable, jolly, charming, bright, coaxing,\r\nand unprincipled. He rarely wrote himself, but would dictate, as he\r\nwalked to and fro, to his wife, whom he would also leave to confront his\r\ncreditors. She was deeply attached to him; and when his father died, she\r\nfound that the careful solicitor had left her a bequest of two pounds a\r\nweek, payable to _herself_.\" And Postans, after he had lost his sight,\r\nwould now and then exclaim--\"Although he treated me so badly, I should\r\nlove to hear the sound of his dear voice again!\" There can be no doubt\r\nthat Henry Mayhew was a genius, a fascinating companion, and a man of\r\ninexhaustible resource and humour--though humour was but one side of his\r\nbrilliant mind. Indolence was his besetting sin; and his will was\r\nuntutored.\r\n\r\n     \"An admirable all-round talker,\" Henry Vizetelly wrote to me\r\n     shortly before his death, \"Henry Mayhew was brimming over with\r\n     novel ideas on all manner of subjects, from artificial production\r\n     of diamonds to the reformation of ticket-of-leave men. He was\r\n     constantly planning some new publication or broaching novel ideas\r\n     on the most out-of-the-way subjects. He would scheme and ponder all\r\n     the day long, but he abominated the labour of putting his ideas\r\n     into tangible shape. He would talk like a book on any subject for\r\n     hours together if he could only find listeners, but could with\r\n     difficulty be brought to put pen to paper. Most of his books were\r\n     written from his ideas by his younger brother Augustus, or were\r\n     dictated directly to his wife, who acted as his amanuensis.\r\n     Although he made considerable sums by his writings, he never seemed\r\n     to have a shilling; and most of the letters he received were from\r\n     dunning creditors. These missives, however, never troubled him, for\r\n     he never broke the envelopes of one of them, but handed all his\r\n     correspondence over to his wife to do as she pleased with and\r\n     answer such letters as she thought necessary. He was very\r\n     temperate. Whether he smoked as a young man, I am not aware; but\r\n     he never smoked at the periodical evening gatherings at his house,\r\n     when the guests could hardly see each other for the clouds of\r\n     tobacco-smoke. On these occasions the most abstruse subjects were\r\n     often discussed, and all we young wiseacres present contributed our\r\n     modicum of knowledge towards the elucidation of problems that\r\n     sorely perplexed the thinkers of the epoch. Although Mayhew would\r\n     sit up till any hour as long as anyone would stay and listen to\r\n     him, he never allowed this to interfere with his early-rising\r\n     habits.\"\r\n\r\nThe impression made by Mayhew upon his contemporaries was invariably\r\nsuch as to command respect for his intellectual capacity. Considering\r\nhis deep, philosophic mind, says one critic, if his lines had been cast\r\nin more serious places, he might have been a sociologist, the equal of\r\nJohn Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer. There is proof enough of this in\r\nthat wonderful encyclopædic work of \"London Labour and London Poor,\"\r\nwhich displayed his original mind and his power of research, as much as\r\nother books displayed his marvellous invention, fancy, and initiative,\r\nand it is the only one of his undertakings which he had perseverance\r\nenough to carry through to a triumphant conclusion--so far as it can\r\nclaim finality. It was while he was engaged on this work that Landells\r\n(according to a private letter) visited him and found him, in company\r\nwith his brother Augustus and William Jerrold, interviewing a\r\n\"coster\"--\"drawing him,\" while Horace Mayhew took down everything the\r\nman said.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man who conceived _Punch_ as it came to be, and who wrote\r\nof it when it was established, \"I smell lots of tin thereabouts; but our\r\nLemon requires a great deal of squeezing.\" What was his connection with\r\n_Punch_, how he agreed with Lemon as to the transfer to Bradbury and\r\nEvans, how he found himself replaced by (or, as he considered, outwitted\r\nby) Mark Lemon in the editorship has already been recited. Nevertheless,\r\nhe was retained as \"Suggestor-in-Chief\"--an office which suited him well\r\nenough, considering his hatred of the drudgery of writing.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Henry Mayhew,\" writes _Punch's_ ex-Printer, \"the special\r\n     joke-provider for _Punch_, was a most jocular character. He would\r\n     stand beside the compositor while he was working at his case, and\r\n     closely watch every movement of his hand in picking up each letter.\r\n     He said he could not make out how ever the compositor could keep\r\n     the alphabetical order of each box in his memory. So to master the\r\n     mystery he set to work and learned the boxes for himself, and would\r\n     often find amusement, when waiting for a proof, in setting up a few\r\n     lines, very slowly at first, but, shifting the composing rule and\r\n     thoughtlessly laying down the stick the wrong way, generally upset\r\n     all his work, and so he gave it up in despair. This Mr. Mayhew was\r\n     very clever in creating and roughly sketching out many of the small\r\n     comic column illustrations, and would write the witty inscriptions\r\n     for them. These would then go to the artist, who sketched out the\r\n     idea and so completed it. In _Punch_, as in many other similar\r\n     works, the mind to invent the idea caricatured, and the hand that\r\n     pencils it, belong to two very different persons and capacities.\r\n     Mr. Mayhew was very clever in this way, and anything of a comic\r\n     nature he saw he would at once sketch off and then have a cut made\r\n     of it. Most of the inimitable cuts in the first few volumes of\r\n     _Punch_ are of his invention. He was always sketching and taking\r\n     rough notes of everything he saw. The great John Leech called him\r\n     his indispensable 'Jack-all, or broad-grin provider.'\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his disappointment, Henry Mayhew remained with _Punch_ until\r\n1845. His last literary contribution--\"A Shaksperean Nursery Rhyme,\" on\r\nthe subject of Macready playing Shakespeare in Paris before Louis\r\nPhilippe and Prince de Joinville--appeared in February of that year; but\r\nhe still attended the Dinners and made suggestions for cartoons, of\r\nwhich twelve were accepted in that year. With his proposal, however, of\r\nthe cartoon of \"Don Roebucis,\" which was drawn by Leech (14th March,\r\n1846), his last word was said; and from that time forward his connection\r\nwith _Punch_ ceased absolutely. He had given the paper its character and\r\ntone; he had suggested its first great success, the Almanac; he had\r\nsupported its transfer, whereby it was firmly established; and he had\r\ncracked its biggest joke--the joke which is universally quoted to this\r\nvery day.[33] He died in 1887, at the age of 75, and his old friend\r\ncelebrated him in verse, none too correctly, though in the kindliest\r\nmanner, ending thus:--\r\n\r\n            \".... Farewell!\r\n  The record of the age's course will tell\r\n  Of him whose name a double honour bore,\r\n  Comrade of _Punch_ and champion of the poor.\"[34]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. STIRLING COYNE. (_From a Photograph by Lombard and\r\nCo._)]\r\n\r\nThere was a fund of Irish humour in Joseph Stirling Coyne. He had proved\r\nit by his plays long before he undertook his share of the co-editorship\r\nwhich was offered him at that \"Edinburgh Castle\" meeting where so much\r\nof _Punch's_ present and future was arranged. He was at that time\r\neight-and-twenty years of age; and although he was dramatic critic of\r\nthe \"Sunday Times,\" the drama rather than the press was his natural\r\nfield of action--indeed, he wrote no fewer than five-and-fifty pieces of\r\nvarious kinds, besides plays in collaboration, and was secretary of the\r\nDramatic Authors' Society, until his death. Nevertheless, he belonged in\r\na manner to the inner circle of the \"_Punch_ set,\" and frequented the\r\ntaverns that were their clubs; and he even went in double harness with\r\nMark Lemon as co-editor, _vice_ \"Alphabet\" Bayley, of \"The Bude\r\nLight\"--an English imitation of \"Les Guêpes.\" He was, in fact, a man of\r\nsome celebrity who had already gained public reputation beyond the band\r\nof men, brilliant, no doubt, but, for the most part, with their\r\nsuccesses yet to come--so that he was accorded the important rôle which\r\nhe filled with peculiar modesty. He wrote extremely little, but he seems\r\nto have formed some distinct notion of his share in the foundation, for\r\nEdmund Yates records how his father once came home and, throwing the\r\nfirst number of _Punch_ on the table, said, \"Here is Stirling Coyne's\r\nnew paper!\" At last Coyne was charged by Lemon (who always referred\r\ncontemptuously to him as \"Paddy\") with stealing one of his \"Puff Papers\"\r\nfrom a Dublin paper. At _Punch's_ transfer Coyne quietly, though\r\ndiscontentedly, retired from duties which had hitherto brought him\r\nneither reputation nor pleasure, and only a hundred pounds in cash from\r\nLandells, and from Douglas Jerrold--as I learn from one who heard it--a\r\nsavage _mot_, referring to his somewhat uncleanly appearance, which will\r\nundoubtedly adhere--\"Stirling Coyne? _I call him Filthy Lucre!_\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GILBERT ABBOTT À BECKETT.]\r\n\r\nFrom no choicer spirit than Gilbert Abbott à Beckett could Mayhew have\r\nsought for assistance and literary support. He was the first applied to,\r\nand of all the Staff he had had by far the most experience in the\r\nproduction of \"comic papers,\" although he was only thirty years of age.\r\nHis brother, the late Hon. T. T. à Beckett, has told how he and his chum\r\nHenry Mayhew, his junior by a year, with a consolidated share capital of\r\nthree pounds and a mortgage to a printer of future profits, prepared to\r\nstart a \"satirical paper,\" to be called \"The Cerberus\"--the joint\r\neditors being then still young boys. As it happily befell, Mr. à\r\nBeckett, senior, discovered a proof of the first number, and with his\r\nsolicitorial eye discovered some forty-three clear libels in the four\r\ncolumns. He hastened to the address on the imprint, and set the matter\r\nplainly before the printer, who was only too glad to cancel the whole\r\nmatter that had been \"set\" upon payment of the bill. So deeply were the\r\nlads affronted by this unwarrantable interference with their\r\njournalistic spirit and liberty of the subject that they ran away from\r\nhome to Edinburgh, walking all the way; but soon returned in a woeful\r\nplight. From that moment, Gilbert turned journalist--it came to him as a\r\nsecond nature--and thenceforward supported himself by his pen, while\r\nestablishing a very fair position at the Bar, thanks to the support of\r\nhis father's firm.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1831 that he presented himself prominently before the public.\r\nJerrold's \"Punch in London\" had not yet begun its little life of\r\nseventeen numbers, so that the moment was propitious for à Beckett to\r\nembark on a venture of his own; and on December 10th it made its first\r\nappearance. This was \"Figaro in London,\" in which his youthful ardour\r\nand plain speaking found energetic vent. He was always ready, in a\r\nhumorous, bombastic sort of spirit, to smash the aristocracy, to chaff\r\nAlfred Bunn, to abuse low-class Jews, and to discuss the theatre. In\r\nthese agreeable vocations he hit the popular taste, and certainly\r\nachieved a considerable circulation, which, Timbs declares, reached at\r\none time 70,000 copies. Small topical cuts, grandiloquently set down as\r\n\"magnificent caricatures,\" were well arranged as a rule, and things were\r\ngoing well enough when editor and artist fell out; Robert Cruikshank\r\ntook Seymour's place--and à Beckett's monthly adulation of his old\r\n\"cartoonist's\" work turned suddenly to contempt.\r\n\r\nAll this was meant more than half in fun; it was too violently personal\r\nto be serious. Anyway, à Beckett declared in the paper that \"it is not\r\ntrue that Robert Seymour has gone out of his mind--he had none to go out\r\nof,\" and Seymour retaliated heartily with a \"sharp _cut_.\" In due course\r\nSeymour resumed his place on \"Figaro,\" and retained it to the end. In\r\nDecember, 1834, à Beckett had handed over the paper, in the height of\r\nits prosperity, to Henry Mayhew, who continued it for a time, and in\r\n1839 it came to an end. Yet on so slender a basis as this has been\r\nbrought against à Beckett the cruel charge that it was these assaults\r\nwhich did at a subsequent period drive Seymour out of his mind and led\r\nto his unhappy suicide.\r\n\r\nAfter \"Figaro\" died, and indeed partly during its continuance, à Beckett\r\nlaunched out into an extraordinary series of extraordinary papers,\r\nediting for other proprietors \"The Wag,\" \"The Evangelical Penny\r\nMagazine,\" Dibdin's \"Penny Trumpet,\" \"The Thief\" (under the engaging\r\nfrankness of whose title we may see the forerunner of \"Public Opinion\"),\r\n\"Poor Richard's Journal,\" and \"The People's Penny Pictures;\" while on\r\nhis own account he ran successively \"The Terrific Penny Magazine,\" \"The\r\nGhost,\" \"The Lover,\" \"The Gallery of Terrors,\" \"The Figaro Monthly\r\nNewspaper,\" \"The Figaro Caricature Gallery,\" and \"The Comic Magazine.\"\r\nBut in spite of all this ingenuity in title-devising, and of all this\r\ndogged perseverance--though one can hardly call it seriousness--not one\r\nof these journals obtained public support. As a matter of fact, they\r\nwere the journalistic wild oats of a born journalist and an exuberant\r\nlittérateur, who, as a youthful playwright and a budding barrister, now\r\nhad his hands quite full, yet--such was the fever of his industry--never\r\nfull enough.\r\n\r\nHis first contribution to _Punch_, according to W. H. Wills' statement,\r\nwas \"The Above Bridge Navy\" (p. 35, Volume I., 1841); but it is\r\npractically certain that \"Commercial Intelligence\" in the first number\r\nis his. \"I recollect well,\" says the Hon. T. T. à Beckett, in his\r\nReminiscences, \"my brother--who wrote for it from the first number to\r\nthe last that appeared in his life-time--bringing me away from my office\r\non an assurance that if I accompanied him as far as the Strand, he would\r\nshow me something that would fill me at once with gratification and\r\namazement. He kept me in suspense until I reached Catherine Street, when\r\nhe stopped short and said, 'Now you shall see me draw a pound from\r\n_Punch_, and if that don't amaze you and gratify you, you must have but\r\na poor sense of the marvellous and very little brotherly sympathy.'\"\r\n\r\nJust about the period when the negotiations were being carried on with\r\nBradbury and Evans, à Beckett began to fall off in the amount of his\r\ncontributions, and for a time practically ceased altogether. At this\r\ntime he edited the \"Squib\" (28th May, 1842), a folio sheet published at\r\nthree-halfpence, very respectably conducted and printed, and owned by\r\nLast _Punch's_ old printer, illustrated by Henning, Hamerton, and\r\nNewman, _Punch_ artists, treating many of _Punch's_ pet subjects in the\r\n_Punch_ spirit, including \"Physiologies,\" which the older paper had made\r\nits own. It was also stated that several of the _Punch_ Staff were among\r\nits contributors. However this may be, the \"Squib\" went off in December\r\nof the same year, and à Beckett thenceforward worked loyally for _Punch_\r\nfor the rest of his life, and bequeathed moreover his two sons to\r\n_Punch's_ service.\r\n\r\nHis popular \"Songs for the Seedy,\" a series of eight poems, were\r\npublished in this year in _Punch_, as well as \"Songs of the Flowers;\"\r\nand soon his \"Ballads of the Briefless\" made a considerable stir in\r\n_Punch's_ circle. À Beckett had been called to the Bar some time before,\r\nso that his ballads as well as the articles from his hand which\r\nappeared--and, from time to time, continued--over the signature of \"Mr.\r\nBriefless,\" had a touch of verisimilitude which went straight to the\r\nsoft places in the hearts and imagination of the Great Unbriefed. \"Mr.\r\nBriefless\" became an institution in the paper, as, in other journals,\r\nMr. O. P. Q. Philander Smiff, and again, in a lower social scale, Mr.\r\nAlfred Sloper, became recognised by a later generation. This unfortunate\r\ngentleman of the Bar--a gentleman always, in spite of his weakness of\r\nintellect and character--was shown in all the difficulties germane to\r\nhis barren profession, and in all the ludicrous situations that came\r\nnatural to the man. Many of his quaint aphorisms are still remembered,\r\nsuch as that, elsewhere recorded--\"As my laundress makes my bed, so I\r\nmust lie upon it,\" and \"The clerk brings down his master's grey\r\nhorsehair wig in sorrow to the Court.\" Yet he was not without\r\nself-respect, not to say vanity, for on the occasion of a great\r\npolitical crisis, when the resignation of the Ministry was impending,\r\n\"Mr. Briefless\" somewhat injudiciously left his retreat at Gravesend and\r\ncame up to London, in order to be on the spot should he be called upon\r\nto form or to join the future Cabinet. The only summons he received,\r\nhowever, was from his tailor, and, with the unfailing judgment and good\r\nsense that characterised him, he withdrew once more into the country.\r\n\"Mr. Briefless\" and \"Mr. Dunup,\" his friend, were creations that were at\r\nonce recognised, and were welcomed during the fifteen years of their\r\noccasional appearance.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 his \"_Punch's_ Heathen Mythology\" followed Wills' chapters on\r\nthe same subject, and in the following year his \"Comic Blackstone\"--one\r\nof the cleverest burlesques of its kind in the language--served another\r\npurpose than to amuse his readers: it forced him to study the\r\ncommentaries--for the first time, it was facetiously said--and so made a\r\nbetter lawyer of him, and helped to fit him for the magisterial bench,\r\nto which he was soon to be summoned. His \"Comic Bradshaw\" was another\r\nsuccess, which Mr. Burnand repeated and improved upon years after in his\r\ninimitable \"Out of Town.\" Mr. Arthur à Beckett, speaking of his father's\r\nwork, tells me: \"I remember on one occasion when my father had written a\r\ndrama descriptive of the mysteries of Bradshaw, Leech, to whom it was\r\nsent for illustration, introduced a series of portraits of the author.\r\nLemon, noticing this, suggested that the drama should end by the hero\r\ngetting his head shaved, more clearly to understand the intricacies of\r\nrailway traffic. My father adopted the suggestion, and Leech followed\r\nthe 'copy.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was not in these series that his chief work lay, however, but in the\r\nenormous mass of matter he turned into _Punch's_ pages month by month.\r\nHe was by far the most prolific of all the contributors, almost up to\r\nthe time of his death. Articles humorous and pungent on every variety of\r\ntopic, verse graceful, bright, and comic, sparkling puns innumerable,\r\nwith increasing thought and sense as the man grew older and realised\r\nmore and more the responsibility of his position and _Punch's_--all\r\nflowed from him in an unceasing, easy stream, distinguished always for\r\nits fun and facility. As his average contribution to each volume was a\r\nhundred columns, it will be seen that in the time he was working for\r\n_Punch_ his total of prose and verse amounted to three thousand feet,\r\nor a column nearly as high as the Eiffel Tower! There was, besides, the\r\namount of \"outside\" work that came from his pen--he was leader-writer to\r\nthe \"Illustrated London News,\" and as such was the literary father of\r\nShirley Brooks, the grandfather of Mr. Sala, and the great-grandfather\r\nof Mr. James Payn. He was also leader-writer on the \"Times,\" and on one\r\noccasion actually wrote all the leaders of the day's issue. This strange\r\ncoincidence arose from his having had a leader \"crowded out\" from the\r\nday before, which was naturally set down for use the next day, when he\r\ncontributed his usual article without any question arising; and then a\r\nsudden appeal upon a subject with which he was specially familiar\r\nbrought into the paper a third article from him--and that in the days,\r\nnow fifty years ago, when the influence and position of the \"Times\" were\r\nperhaps even greater, relatively, than they are to-day: at least, when\r\nthere was no competitor that could seriously pretend to share them. In\r\naddition to this he edited Cruikshank's \"Table Book,\" and wrote the\r\nComic Histories of England and Rome. It was, it is generally said, on\r\nthe occasion of the first of these books being announced that Douglas\r\nJerrold wrote to Charles Dickens: \"_Punch_, I believe, holds its\r\ncourse.... Nevertheless, I do not very cordially agree with its new\r\nspirit. I am convinced that the world will get tired (at least, I hope\r\nso) of this eternal guffaw at all things. After all, life has something\r\nserious in it. It cannot all be a comic history of humanity. Some men\r\nwould, I believe, write a Comic Sermon on the Mount. Think of a Comic\r\nHistory of England; the drollery of Alfred; the fun of Sir Thomas More\r\nin the Tower; the farce of his daughter begging the dear head, and\r\nclasping it in her coffin on her bosom! Surely the world will be sick of\r\nsuch blasphemy!... When, moreover, the change comes, unless _Punch_ goes\r\na little back to his occasional gravities, he'll be sure to suffer.\" And\r\nDickens replied in a letter thanking him for sympathetic reviews, in\r\n_Punch_--\"Anent the 'Comic ----' and similar comicalities, I feel\r\nexactly with you.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, with the exception of the latter part of Jerrold's outburst,\r\nwherein he was undoubtedly right, all this protest is exaggerated\r\nnonsense--at least, as applied to à Beckett. One would think that\r\nneither Jerrold nor Dickens could bear a burlesque in good\r\ntaste--Jerrold of all men! But it is just as likely that Jerrold was not\r\nreferring to à Beckett at all, but to Thackeray, whose \"Miss\r\nTickletoby's Comic History\" had already made its appearance in _Punch_,\r\nand had been incontinently stopped. In any case, the public did not\r\nagree with him, for both works are still popular favourites. Moreover,\r\nhe liked à Beckett too well to harm him in the mind of a common friend;\r\nand he was unquestionably aware that the loftiness of à Beckett's aims\r\nand character rendered him unassailable against a charge of irreverence\r\nor lack of respect. Certain it is, at least, that when à Beckett died at\r\nBoulogne Jerrold felt the blow so deeply that he gave up that town\r\nthenceforward as a place of residence, nor would he ever visit it again.\r\n\r\nIt was at the early age of thirty-eight that à Beckett was appointed\r\npolice-magistrate, chiefly owing to the masterly report he drew up as\r\nPoor-Law Commissioner in respect to the notorious Andover Union\r\nWorkhouse scandals[35]--\"one of the best,\" said the Home Secretary,\r\n\"ever presented to Parliament.\" The appointment was much discussed, for\r\nthe general feeling had been educated in the views of Lord Selborne, who\r\nasserted that no \"person\" connected with the Press nor any \"gentleman in\r\nthe wine trade\" could be permitted to attain to such an honour as the\r\nBench--an absurdity which has long since been dismissed. On one\r\noccasion, it is said, when à Beckett lived at No. 10, Hyde Park Gate\r\nSouth, Kensington Gore, he was instructed to hold himself in readiness,\r\nas magistrate, to answer a summons to read the Riot Act in Hyde Park to\r\nthe unruly mob whose methods of protest against a popular grievance\r\nconstituted the \"Beer Bill Riots\" of 1855. That summons never came,\r\nluckily for him; for later in the day he discovered, to his dismay,\r\nthat his careful and solicitous wife, with greater respect for her\r\nhusband's skin than for the needs of Government, Police, and Proletariat\r\ncombined, had gone out early, after securely locking the unconscious\r\nmagistrate in his library, and had prudently carried off the key.\r\n\r\nÀ Beckett had been one of the shyest and most nervous men that ever\r\nlived, but his appointment to the police-court--first at Greenwich, then\r\nat Southwark--removed much of his undue modesty, and he was recognised\r\nas being energetic, sagacious, and humane. He was a tremendous worker,\r\nincomparably quick, and above all was absolutely punctual in his\r\ndelivery of \"copy\"--a virtue quite sufficient to account for his\r\npopularity with publishers, who also were attracted by his retiring and\r\ndistinguished manners. Though his conversation was bright, he preferred\r\nto keep his witticisms for his public or private writings, as when, in\r\nsending in a parcel of \"copy\" to Mark Lemon, he wrote on the outside:--\r\n\r\n  \"Dear Mark--I do herewith enclose\r\n  Some 'copy' both in verse and prose.\r\n  'Tis neither very bright nor terse--\r\n  The verse is bad--the prose is worse.\r\n  But you, of course, will read and check it.\r\n      Yours ever, G. etcet'ra Beckett.\"\r\n\r\nThis paper passed, as a wrapper, from Lemon to Mr. Birket Foster, and\r\nfrom the hands of that gentleman to an autograph-hunter undiscoverable.\r\n\r\nÀ Beckett's wit was exceedingly nimble, and as a consequence he was a\r\nfacile punster. One of his happiest jokes of the kind has been set on\r\nrecord. When the election of Louis Napoleon appeared likely, the policy\r\nof _Punch_ in respect to it was anxiously discussed at the Table. One of\r\nthe Staff--Thackeray most likely--declared that it would be wisest to be\r\nindefinite. \"Nonsense,\" said à Beckett, \"if you're not definite, you'd\r\nbetter be dumb in it!\"\r\n\r\nWhile occupied in writing a series of papers called \"Mr. Punch's Guide\r\nBooks to the Crystal Palace,\" illustrated by Tenniel, Gilbert à Beckett\r\ndied at Boulogne from typhus fever, his youngest son Walter predeceasing\r\nhim by two days from the same complaint--the grief of any knowledge of\r\nit, however, being happily spared the father. He was buried in Highgate\r\nCemetery, and the inscription engraved upon the tombstone was reproduced\r\nin an abbreviated and modified form from the touching obituary notice in\r\nwhich his brother-workers, through Jerrold's pen, testified to his\r\nmerits and to their affection: \"Endowed with a genial, manly spirit;\r\ngifted with subtlest powers of wit and humour, they were ever exercised\r\nto the healthiest and most innocent purpose. As a Magistrate, his wise,\r\ncalm, humane administration of the law proved that the fulfilment of the\r\ngravest duties is not incompatible with the sportiveness of literary\r\ngenius. 'His place knows him not,' but his memory is tenderly\r\ncherished.\"\r\n\r\nThe connection of Angus Bethune Reach with _Punch_ was not of very long\r\nduration. With Albert Smith he had been joint editor of \"The Man in the\r\nMoon,\" and with Shirley Brooks was one of the special correspondents of\r\nthe \"Morning Chronicle\" in the South of France, as well as its\r\nParliamentary reporter. He had followed up Albert Smith's series of\r\n\"Natural Histories,\" of \"The Gent,\" \"The Flirt,\" and other specimens of\r\nEnglish Society, with \"Bores\" and \"Humbugs,\" which ran through several\r\neditions. He had joined \"The Puppet Show\" in 1848, while still quite a\r\nyouth; he had written \"The Comic Bradshaw\" (which found an echo in\r\n_Punch_ years later) and one or two successful novels, and had with\r\nBrooks laid siege to a position on _Punch's_ Staff. This, it might\r\nalmost be said, he carried, as Brooks did, by assault; and having given\r\nup the editorship of \"The Man in the Moon\" with its twenty-eighth number\r\n(1849), he was duly summoned to the _Punch_ Table.\r\n\r\nHis life was at that time hardly a pleasant one, though his industry\r\n(for the craze of work was upon him) was as great as his versatility,\r\nand his field of labour as wide as his knowledge. When he came to the\r\n_Punch_ Table, he found his haven; but he was heckled, of course, by\r\nDouglas Jerrold, on the score of his name and its quaint pronunciation.\r\nConcerning this name (pronounced Re-ach in the German manner, _anglice_\r\nRe-ack), Angus once asked his father, a Writer to the Signet, in the\r\nhearing of my informant, the late H. G. Hine, what on earth it meant.\r\n\"As in Highland Scotch,\" was the reply, \"'Dhu' means 'black' and 'Roy'\r\nmeans 'red,' so Reach means half-and-half, or 'brown.'\" He therefore\r\ninsisted on its proper pronunciation; with the natural result. Jerrold\r\ndelighted in teasing him about it, and at a Dinner at the \"Ship\" at\r\nBrighton, where the _Punch_ Staff held one of their meetings,\r\nJerrold[36] leant forward at dessert and asked--\"Mr. Re-ack, may I pass\r\nyou a pe-ack?\" And on another occasion, when Reach protested against\r\nJerrold's persistent ill-treatment of his name, the wit replied, \"Oh, I\r\nsee. Re-ack when we speak to you, but _reach_ when we read you!\"\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1854, Reach's incorrigible industry bore its Dead-Sea fruit;\r\nbroken down with over-work, his mind utterly gave way. Thereupon his\r\nfriends of the Fielding Club, reinforced by Albert Smith of \"The Man in\r\nthe Moon,\" joined together to play for his benefit Smith's pantomime\r\nburlesque, \"Harlequin Guy Fawkes; or, a Match for a King,\" at the\r\nOlympic Theatre, April, 1855. Arthur Smith, Albert's brother, played\r\npantaloon; Bidwell was harlequin; Joseph Robins, clown; Albert Smith,\r\nCatesby; Edmund Yates, the lover; and Miss Rosina Wright (\"always Rosy,\r\nalways Wright,\" wrote Smith) was columbine. The rush, said E. L.\r\nBlanchard, was unprecedented, and stalls were cheap at ten pounds. The\r\ngreat broadsword fight between Smith (Catesby) and Robins (Guy Fawkes),\r\nin the rich traditions of the Surrey-Crummles School, was the hit of the\r\nevening, and has been immortalised by Sir John Tenniel in his drawing\r\nfor _Punch_ (p. 149, Volume XXVIII.), entitled \"The Amateur Olympians.\"\r\nBut Reach did not benefit long from the efforts of his friends, and died\r\nbefore he was thirty.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] See p. 2.\r\n\r\n[30] Douglas Jerrold writes to Hodder under date September 9th:--\"I have\r\nbeen worked to death for _Punch_, having it all on my shoulders, Mark, à\r\nBeckett, and Thackeray being away. Nevertheless, last week it went up\r\n1,500.\" Jerrold, it may be added, would at that time undertake some of\r\nthe editorial as well as the literary work.\r\n\r\n[31] This was \"The Little Frenchman's Second Lesson,\" an important poem\r\noccupying a whole page.\r\n\r\n[32] Under \"Editor\" were entered all, except very special, contributions\r\ncoming from outside.\r\n\r\n[33] See p. 141.\r\n\r\n[34] An example of Henry Mayhew's quaint presentation of his own\r\nexperiences is to be found in the paragraph he contributed under the\r\ntitle of \"TAVERN CHARGES AT DOVER\":--\"Waiter! How much is my glass of\r\nbrandy-and-water?\" \"The bill, sir.\" \"What! 10s. 6d.?\" \"Yes, sir,\r\nbrandy's 2s.; never charge less.\" \"Well?\" \"Sugar 6d.; never charge\r\nless.\" \"Go on.\" \"Waxlight and apartment, 5s.\" \"Why, I've only been here\r\nfive minutes.\" \"That's not our fault, sir; we never charge less.\" \"Go\r\non.\" \"Servants, 2s.\" \"What?\" \"Me, boots and chambermaid; never charge\r\nless.\" \"Well, what next?\" \"The use of plate, glass, and linen, 1s.\"\r\n\"What do you mean?\" \"Teaspoon, tumbler, and table-cloth; never charge\r\nless; but--we makes you a present of the biling water.\" \"Very well,\r\nthere's your 10s. 6d., and I shall write to the 'Times.'\" \"Yes,\r\nsir--pen, ink, and paper, 1s.; never charge less.\"\r\n\r\n[35] A \"Petition,\" supposed to come from the inmates (written by\r\nPercival Leigh), appeared in _Punch_ (p. 101, Volume IX.), in which the\r\npetitioners begged that some of the kitchen refuse and pigs'-wash,\r\nhitherto used to _over_fatten swine, might be reserved for them. This\r\npetition had an admirable effect.\r\n\r\n[36] Hodder incorrectly gives the _mot_ to Thackeray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n_PUNCH'S_ WRITERS: 1841.\r\n\r\n     H. P. Grattan--W. H. Wills--R. B. Postans--Bread-Tax and\r\n     Tooth-Tax--G. Hodder--G. H. B. Rodwell--Douglas Jerrold--His\r\n     Caustic Wit--The \"Q Papers\"--A Statesman _pour rire_--His Sympathy\r\n     with the Poor and Oppressed--Wins for _Punch_ his Political\r\n     Influence--Ill-health--\"_Punch's_ Letters\"--The \"Jenkins\" and\r\n     \"Pecksniff\" Papers--\"Mrs. Caudle\"--Jerrold's Love of Children,\r\n     common to the Staff--He Silences his Fellow-wits--And is Routed by\r\n     a Barmaid--He sends his Love to the Staff--And they prove theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remaining contributors to the first number were Joseph Allen, H. P.\r\nGrattan, and W. H. Wills. The contribution of the first-named has\r\nalready been indicated. H. P. \"Grattan\"--whose real name was Plunkett,\r\nand whose occasional pseudonym was the familiar \"Fusbos\"--worked well\r\nfor the first numbers and for the Almanac. He was a witty versifier and\r\nclever dramatist, but he soon tired of the paper and directed his\r\nenergies into other channels. W. H. Wills--\"Harry Wills\" he was always\r\ncalled--was a more important and a more faithful contributor. His first\r\nverses were \"A Quarter-day Cogitation\" (p. 5), and for some time he was\r\nthe regular dramatic critic of _Punch_, in which a considerable amount\r\nof space was accorded to the review of amusements of all kinds, and not\r\na little to Charles Kean and his histrionic deficiencies. Besides\r\n\"_Punch's_ Theatre,\" he wrote paragraphs, verses, and criticisms\r\ninnumerable, including the series of \"_Punch's_ Natural History of\r\nCourtship,\" illustrated by the pencils of Sir John Gilbert, Newman, and\r\nGavarni; \"_Punch's_ Comic Mythology,\" \"_Punch's_ Information for the\r\nPeople,\" as well as \"_Punch's_ Valentines,\" and lively skits like \"The\r\nBurst Boiler and the Broken Heart,\" and the verses in praise of\r\npawnbrokers, \"The Uncles of England.\" After helping the Almanac for\r\n1846, his _Punch_ connection was interrupted for a period through his\r\nbeing called to Edinburgh to edit \"Chambers's Journal;\" but on his\r\nreturn to London two years later he resumed his position in a modified\r\nform. He became secretary to Charles Dickens, who was then editing the\r\n\"Daily News,\" as well as his assistant editor on \"Household Words,\" and\r\nsubsequently on \"All the Year Round,\" so that little time was left him\r\nfor humorous composition--though he certainly found leisure to issue\r\n\"The Family Joe Miller.\" When he was in Edinburgh he married Robert\r\nChambers' sister--a lady possessed of true Scottish wit, some of whose\r\npithy remarks are still remembered, such as \"The ladies who agitate for\r\nwomen's rights are generally men's lefts.\"\r\n\r\nOf the other two writers who aided in the founding of _Punch_--Postans\r\nand George Hodder--there is little to say. The first-named, indeed, has\r\nalready been sufficiently dealt with, but it may be added that his last\r\ncontribution was his verses--\"A Contribution by Cobden\"--on the subject\r\nof the removal by Sir Robert Peel of the tax on artificial teeth.\r\nPostans saw his chance, for the Repeal of the Corn Laws was already\r\nbeing agitated, and the tooth-tax troubled his mouth less than the tax\r\non bread. His final verse ran--\r\n\r\n  \"Reverse your plan,\" the Goddess [Commerce] said,\r\n    And smiling stood in all her beauty;\r\n  \"Give me untaxed my daily bread,\r\n    And tax my teeth with double duty.\"\r\n\r\nBesides his ambassadorial assistance, and in spite of his presence at\r\nthe _Punch_ Club, Hodder was not of much account on the paper, either in\r\nits formation or its literary production. He was, however, related to\r\n_Punch_ by marriage, being the husband of Henning's beautiful daughter,\r\nthe niece of Kenny Meadows' wife. His last appearances in its pages were\r\nin 1843, when four contributions (including \"_Punch's_ Phrenology\") came\r\nfrom him; and then he resumed his usual work of journalist, became\r\nThackeray's secretary for a time, and died through the upsetting of a\r\ncoach in Richmond Park.\r\n\r\nPassing by Leman Rede and G. H. B. Rodwell (composer, playwright, and\r\nballad writer), neither of whom, so far as I have been able to\r\nascertain, has left any appreciable trace on _Punch_, we come to the\r\nman to whom, more than to anyone else, the paper owed the enormous\r\npolitical influence it once enjoyed, and to whom it is indebted for much\r\nof the literary reputation it still retains--Douglas Jerrold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUGLAS JERROLD\r\n\r\n(_From the Portrait by Sir D. Macnee, F.R.S.A., in the National Portrait\r\nGallery._)]\r\n\r\nIf he was not exactly the wit of his day--for his mind lacked the wider\r\nsympathy, the greater grasp, and gentler refinement of Sydney\r\nSmith's--he was certainly the most brilliant professional humorist of\r\nhis generation--\"a wit, if not first, in the very first line.\" Something\r\nof the bitterness and savagery of Gillray's rampant pleasantry afflicted\r\nhis _vis comica_; and when a happy thought, however unhappy and painful\r\nfor the hearer, came to the tip of his tongue, he could no more resist\r\nslipping it off than he could wilfully have done him injury.\r\n\r\nMark Lemon used to say, \"_Punch_ and I were made for each other.\" With\r\nfar more reason could that notion of reciprocity be applied to Jerrold.\r\nNo man ever gained so much from the paper in which he worked. He simply\r\nfrolicked in its pages, that fitted his talent as accurately as his\r\ngenius suited the times in which he lived. It is doubtful whether he\r\nwould make the same mark in it were he alive to-day; he would have to\r\nseek another publication and another public, or else adopt an utter\r\nchange of tone. But in those lively times, when, obeying the summons\r\naddressed to him in Boulogne, he sent his first political\r\npaper--beginning characteristically with the introduction of Peel, in\r\ntime for the second number--he gave his powers full play. And his\r\nsparkle was the brighter for its setting and its surroundings. His wit\r\nwas for the most part caustic and saturnine, and in no other journal\r\ncould it have so completely identified itself with the _ensemble_ of\r\ntone. Without _Punch_, Jerrold would certainly not have been so\r\ndistinguished a man; yet he somewhere says in one of his works, with a\r\ntouch of ingratitude: \"If you'd pass for somebody, you must sneer at a\r\nplay, but idolise _Punch_\"--as though this were the height of\r\npriggishness. He was a keen judge of things, and might have held that\r\nview; but it was hardly for him, of all men, to publish it.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that, with the enormous reputation for wit which he\r\nenjoyed, and up to which he lived with such triumphant ease, all the\r\nsmarter orphan-jokes of the day were fathered upon him. But there was a\r\nring about the true Jerroldian humour which the connoisseur could hardly\r\nmistake. And the public soon became good enough judges of it too,\r\nstudying it regularly in _Punch_, and refusing for the most part to be\r\nled away to look for it in the other journals which Jerrold edited, with\r\nbut indifferent success so far as their circulation went. Although his\r\nfame was already established as a dramatist before _Punch_ was born, I\r\ndoubt, without _Punch_, he would ever have earned the reputation in pure\r\nliterature which his \"Q Papers\" helped to found.\r\n\r\nIt was with these \"Q Papers\" that he began, and he threw into them some\r\nof his strongest and most withering writing, and oftentimes some of his\r\nweakest sense. With his soft heart melting for the poor, and his fiery\r\nhatred of oppression warping his better judgment, he was led into that\r\nunreasoning attack upon property and authority to which Thackeray\r\ndeprecatingly alludes. Because the poor are unhappy, according to his\r\nphilosophy, therefore are the rich, most of them, their direct\r\noppressors, and ruling bodies, tyrants. Fiercely upright and\r\naggressively impulsive in his championship of the lowly, he was anything\r\nbut sound and thorough in his premisses; and had he the power he might\r\nhave wielded later, his defects as a political economist would\r\ninfallibly have brought about disaster. \"His Radicalism,\" his son has\r\ntold us, \"was that of a humorist\"--that is to say, all his power and all\r\nhis wit as a writer (and they had few, if any, equals in the press), all\r\nhis genius for invective and ridicule, and all his commanding influence\r\nwith the public, were directed against Society and the powers that were,\r\nsimply from a playful sense of humour! Luckily, the evil, or at least\r\nthe danger, thus found a corrective for itself; for although Jerrold's\r\npower, and with it _Punch's_, grew with amazing rapidity among all\r\nclasses, his tirades were felt to come more from the humorist's heart\r\nthan from the statesman's brain. It is thus easy to draw a comparison\r\nbetween Jerrold and Jean Paul Friedrich Richter, of whom Carlyle says:\r\n\"He is a humorist from his inmost soul; he thinks as a humorist, he\r\nfeels, imagines, acts as a humorist. Sport is the element in which his\r\nnature lives and works.... A Titan in his sport, as in his earnestness,\r\nhe oversteps all bounds, and riots without law or measure.\" The words\r\nmight almost have been written of Jerrold himself. But, for all that, he\r\nwas generally recognised as a leading champion of the people's rights\r\nand reformer of their wrongs; and to this passionate earnestness, to\r\nthis keen wit and shrewd sincerity of the unconsciously special pleader,\r\n_Punch_ owed most of the early notice he obtained, and much of his\r\ninfluence in the worlds of politics and Society.\r\n\r\nThese papers, then, of which the first was \"Punch and Peel\" (July 24th,\r\n1841), were, in fact, political leading-articles, satirical, ironical,\r\nbitter, and more often demagogic than humorous, though of wit and humour\r\nboth there was a generous undercurrent. _Punch_ showed himself at once a\r\nfighting man who meant to be in the thick of the fray, a politician as\r\nimpulsive as Macaulay; and though Jerrold did not begin to sign his\r\narticles until the ninth week (which has given grounds to some writers\r\nto assert that \"Peel Regularly Called In\" was the first of his\r\ncontributions), he soon succeeded in setting up \"Q\" as a personality\r\nevery bit as important and influential amongst his readers as _Punch_\r\nhimself. The Court, the Church, the Political and Social arena, he\r\nincluded them all in his comprehensive gaze, and not an injustice, a\r\nsham, an affectation, or a blunder--or what he happened to regard as\r\nsuch--but came in for exposure and castigation. It was fortunate for him\r\nand for _Punch_, no doubt, that he was \"a humorist;\" for his own\r\nblunders and misjudgments were regarded with the more indulgence for it,\r\nor were condoned as the excusable excesses of a chartered jester running\r\nplayfully amok. But it must not be imagined that though a humorist he\r\nwas not desperately sincere. His own early struggles, his ghastly\r\nexperience, as he ever thought it, when as a midshipman in the Navy he\r\nsaw how authority had to be enforced by flogging, and witnessed all the\r\nrevolting horrors of the cockpit during an engagement, had imparted\r\nintense earnestness to his mind; and he focussed all his brilliancy on\r\nthe opportunity _Punch_ afforded of tilting at the windmills in the\r\nplain. The fact seems to be that Jerrold's heart, and sometimes his\r\nlogic and his judgment as well, were a good deal of a woman's;\r\ndistinguished by every estimable and admirable quality, but with little\r\nstatesmanlike perspicuity and moderation. Such may truly be said of\r\nthose early \"Q Papers,\" by which, nevertheless, he was able to effect\r\nmuch, then and thereafter, greatly to the good of the people, yet often\r\nwrought some of that intolerance and injustice which he was too ready to\r\nascribe to others.\r\n\r\nIt was he, more than anyone else, who forced on _Punch_ that admixture\r\nof Radicalism with his Whiggery which did not wear off for the first\r\nyears of his life, and which was often enough preached with that\r\npicturesqueness of expression which we nowadays would smile at as\r\n\"high-falutin.\" But the lofty ideas of the writer carried off this fault\r\nof style. His creed was simple and clear: Cant was devilish and\r\nSamaritanism godly; to him hypocrisy was the blackest of the vices, and\r\nkindness the sum of all the virtues. It mattered little that that\r\nkindness misplaced might bring a train of evils in its place; sympathy\r\nwas the one thing wanted; the quinine of stern justice (except against\r\nthe great and rich) should ever be watered down with mercy. It was, in\r\nfact, the religion less of the practical politician and true reformer,\r\nthan of the worthy, upright, kind-hearted, unthinking Christian. His\r\nvery fearlessness made men fear him, as his motives and ability\r\ncompelled their respect; and the majority, who cared less for political\r\nphilosophy than for political fervour, applauded him blindfold, and in\r\ndue time accorded to _Punch_ a place in their esteem second only to that\r\nenjoyed by the \"Times.\" Of course, \"bitterness\" was expected in the\r\nsatirical papers of that day; and it is not pretended that Jerrold was\r\never so unreasonable or so anarchical in the pages of _Punch_ as William\r\nBrough revealed himself in the brilliant attacks on the propertied\r\nclasses in which he indulged in his Liverpool journal. He lost, of\r\ncourse, no opportunity of assailing the Duke of Wellington, and Louis\r\nPhilippe, and the \"Morning Post\" (articles in which he attacked the\r\nsnobs of England before Thackeray did), and other of _Punch's_ permanent\r\nbutts; but his chief merit lies in his having set up the hereditary sins\r\nof Society as targets, and shot his barbed darts into them with unerring\r\naccuracy of aim. Of his bitterness it was said that it was\r\n\"healthy--healthy as bark,\" just as Thackeray--was it not?--had\r\npreviously said of his own writings in \"Britannia.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not till a year afterwards (1842) that he began his \"_Punch's_\r\nLetters to his Son.\" They were tender enough, and show little evidence\r\nthat they were written in weakness and in pain. His health, indeed, gave\r\nhim periods of agony of a rheumatic character, pain in his hands so\r\ngreat that at one time he could not write, and at another his whole\r\nracked body practically paralysed, until a \"cure\" at Malvern gave him\r\nback control of it. On another occasion, but that was in later years,\r\nwhen he was asked how he was, he replied, \"As one that is waiting and is\r\nwaited for,\" and he often wrote, said his son, when the movement of the\r\npen was fierce pain to him. We may see in this physical torment,\r\nperhaps, the mainspring of much of his caustic humour. Mr. Cooper, R.A.,\r\nwould ascribe to over-indulgence much of Jerrold's suffering. \"His\r\ncountenance was open and bright (when sober!), and showed nothing of\r\nthat satirical bitterness for which he was so eminent.... In accordance\r\nwith the fashion of the time the man who could not drink his bottle and\r\nremain sober, drank his bottle and got drunk.\" But the Academician, like\r\nmost teetotalers, would often see drunkenness where Jerrold saw merely\r\ndrink, and probably knew nothing of the latter's own feelings towards\r\nundue indulgence. \"Habitual intoxication,\" wrote Jerrold himself, \"is\r\nthe epitome of every crime;\" and elsewhere, \"The bottle is the devil's\r\ncrucible.\" Yet it must be admitted that he was not averse to what in his\r\nday was called \"true conviviality,\" which, as I have heard it remarked,\r\nnever yet made a man a drunkard, though it may sometimes have made him\r\ndrunk. \"If Bacchus often leads men into quagmires deep as his vats, let\r\nus yet do him this justice--he sometimes leads them out. Ask your\r\nopponent to take another glass of wine.\" And did not Thomas Hood\r\nsuggest, when he was told that by his love of wine he was shortening his\r\ndays, that anyhow he was lengthening his nights?\r\n\r\nWhat may be called the \"Jenkins\" and the \"Pecksniff\" papers belong to\r\nthe same year. The former were directed against the \"Morning Post,\"\r\nwhich, with other loyal journals, in those days adopted a tone towards\r\nCourt and Society hardly in keeping with modern ideas of manly\r\nindependence, and of course its politics were to match. Thackeray and à\r\nBeckett joined later in the sport. But Jerrold, while believing in\r\nThackeray's hatred of the snob, more than suspected him of being a snob\r\nhimself; and Thackeray felt not less convinced of the hollowness of\r\nJerrold's \"stalwartness.\" \"Thackeray had neither love nor respect for\r\nJerrold's democracy,\" Vizetelly tells us. \"I remember him mentioning to\r\nme his having noticed at the Earl of Carlisle's a presentation copy of\r\none of Jerrold's books, the inscription in which ran: 'To the Right\r\nHonourable the Earl of Carlisle, K.G., K.C.B., etc. etc.' 'Ah!' said\r\nThackeray, 'this is the sort of style in which your rigid,\r\nuncompromising Radical always toadies the great.'\" And yet both men were\r\nhonest toady-haters to the core. It was this very hatred of snobbism\r\nwhich inspired Jerrold with his cutting retort to Samuel Warren, author\r\nof \"Ten Thousand a Year,\" who complained that at some aristocratic house\r\nat which he had recently dined he could positively get no fish. \"I\r\nsuppose,\" said Jerrold, \"they had eaten it all upstairs!\"[37]\r\n\r\nThe \"Pecksniff\" papers, as already stated, very nearly involved _Punch_\r\nin its first libel action. The object of its criticism was, of course,\r\nSamuel Carter Hall, who, tradition says, was the origin of Dickens's\r\nimmortal conception. This creation--the symbol of cant and\r\nhypocrisy--was after Jerrold's own heart, and, thinking less of charity\r\nthis time than of justice, he smote the luckless editor of the \"Art\r\nJournal\" hip and thigh, and revelled in his attacks. Hall's articles on\r\nthe industrial art of England were supposed to be dictated more by the\r\ncomplacency and generosity of manufacturers than by the artistic\r\nexcellence of their wares. Sometimes Jerrold would use the image of\r\n\"Pecksniff\" for other and more serious purposes than the baiting of Mr.\r\nHall and his little ways, as when, in 1844, he made this biting\r\nonslaught on the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel:\r\n\r\n\"We have heard that Mr. Charles Dickens is about to apply to the Court\r\nof Chancery for an injunction to prevent Sir Robert Peel continuing any\r\nlonger to personate, in his character of Premier, the character of Mr.\r\nPecksniff, as delineated in _Martin Chuzzlewit_, that character being\r\ncopyright. We hope this rumour is unfounded, as the injunction would\r\ncertainly be refused. Sir Robert Peel is in a condition to prove that\r\nthe part in question has been enacted by him for a long series of years,\r\nand was so long before any of Mr. Dickens's works appeared; in short,\r\nthat he, Sir Robert Peel, is the original Pecksniff.\"\r\n\r\nThe year 1843 was a notable one in _Punch's_ calendar, for in it Jerrold\r\nstruck that note of sympathy and tenderness that was almost immediately\r\nto culminate in Hood's tragic poem. \"The Story of a Feather\" was begun,\r\nand was the greatest success the paper had scored up to that time, with\r\nthe exception of the first Almanac. Dickens, who watched for it and read\r\nit as it came out, wrote privately to him that it was \"a beautiful\r\nbook,\" and his verdict was endorsed by the ever-increasing circle of\r\n_Punch's_ readers. \"Our Honeymoon\" was Jerrold's last series of the\r\nyear--a year which drew from him plenty of outside work. He edited Mr.\r\nHerbert Ingram's admirable but short-lived \"Illuminated Magazine,\" and\r\nwrote for it the \"Chronicles of Clovernook\" and the \"Chronicles of a\r\nGoosequill.\" It is astonishing, in looking back at Jerrold's remarkable\r\nwork at this period, to think that the public reads his books no more,\r\nand prefers to ruin its literary taste on fifth-rate romances rather\r\nthan on the virile novels of a recent past.\r\n\r\nFor a little while nothing of special note, though still a great mass of\r\nwork, came from Jerrold's pen, until 1845, when, as prophesied by Hal\r\nBaylis (_see_ p. 97), \"Mrs. Caudle\" burst upon the town. In common with\r\na few other things achieved by _Punch_, it created a national _furore_,\r\nand set the whole country laughing and talking. Other nations soon took\r\nup the conversation and the laughter, and \"Mrs. Caudle\" passed into the\r\npopular mind and took a permanent place in the language in an incredibly\r\nshort space of time.\r\n\r\n\"Some years after I had ceased my connection with _Punch_,\" says Landells\r\nin one of his autobiographical papers now in my hands, \"I met Douglas\r\nJerrold at the corner of Essex Street in the Strand. It was the time\r\nwhen the first number of the 'Caudle Curtain Lectures' appeared. In the\r\ncourse of conversation I remarked that I did not read _Punch_ regularly,\r\nbut I had by chance perused the opening chapter of his new subject, and\r\nI thought, if he followed up the series in the spirit he had begun, they\r\nwould be the most popular that have ever appeared in its pages. He\r\nlaughed heartily and replied--'It just shows what stuff the people will\r\nswallow. I could write such rubbish as that by the yard;' and he added,\r\n'I have before said, the public will always pay to be amused, but they\r\nwill never pay to be instructed.' The Caudle Lectures did more than any\r\nseries of papers for the universal popularity of _Punch_, and there is\r\nno doubt but they added greatly to Jerrold's reputation, although he\r\nalways affected not to think so.\"\r\n\r\nThe origin of Mrs. Caudle--one of those women interminably loquacious\r\nand militantly gloomy under fancied marital oppression, who (as Jerrold\r\nsaid of another) \"wouldn't allow that there was a bright side to the\r\nmoon\"--was the result of no mental effort. Henry Mayhew's son has said\r\nthat the character was evolved from the relations of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nLandells; but to anyone conversant with them the suggestion is palpably\r\nabsurd. Moreover, Jerrold, himself a good authority, one would have\r\nthought, declared that she was \"the result of no thought;\" she was\r\nmerely \"wafted into his brain.\" The reason of the immediate success of\r\nthese \"Curtain Lectures\" was said to be that every woman in the land\r\nrecognised in the lecturer a gratifying resemblance to someone in her\r\nown circle. It was primarily, no doubt, the _intime_ character of the\r\npapers, rather than their inherent humour, that tickled the public\r\ntaste--though at the same time it gave some offence. A reminiscence of a\r\nliterary _protégée_ of Jerrold's--Mrs. Newton Crosland--seems to bear\r\nthis out. In company with her mother, she was dining at Jerrold's house,\r\nwhen, \"towards the close of the meal, a packet arrived--proofs, I fancy;\r\nat any rate, Douglas Jerrold opened a letter which visibly disturbed\r\nhim. 'Hark at this,' he said, after a little while; and he then\r\nproceeded to read a really pathetic though not very well expressed\r\nletter from an aggrieved matron, who appealed to him to discontinue or\r\nmodify the Caudle Lectures. She declared they were bringing discord into\r\nfamilies and making a multitude of women miserable.\"\r\n\r\nBut they made a greater multitude of men merry, and _Punch_ proceeded\r\nwith them--indeed, he continued so long that his rivals protested\r\nloudly, as well they might in their own interests. They published\r\nengravings of handsome sarcophagi, and gave similar unmistakable hints\r\nthat they considered the interment of Mrs. Caudle's corpse a long time\r\noverdue; while \"Joe Miller the Younger\" represented him as \"The Modern\r\nPaganini playing on One String: 'Caudle--without variations.'\" But\r\nJerrold, who had lately moved from Regent's Park to his house, West\r\nLodge, at Putney Lower Common, continued there to write Caudle Lectures\r\n\"by the yard\"--alternating the locale, according to Mark Lemon, with a\r\ntavern in Bouverie Street. And he laughed to see how his papers were\r\ntranslated into nearly every Continental language, and were transferred\r\nto the stage both in London and the provinces. Mrs. Keeley made a\r\nlife-like Mrs. Caudle at the Lyceum--only perhaps a little too fresh and\r\ncharming; the character in the provinces being often undertaken by male\r\nimpersonators, such, for example, as Mr. Warren. John Leech executed\r\nupon stone a couple of admirable portraits of the conjugal pair, which\r\nwere sold, coloured, for a shilling; but they were soon pirated and\r\nhawked about the streets, and the unprincipled conductors of \"The Penny\r\nSatirist,\" and similar abominations, traded largely not only on the\r\nidentity of the Caudles, but on the words of Mrs. Caudle herself--so\r\nfreely that legal steps had to be taken to stop the nuisance. The latest\r\nedition of this _jeu d'esprit_ is that which has been illustrated by\r\nCharles Keene, and it can hardly be doubted that in his drawings he\r\noften touches the high-water mark of his artistic execution.\r\n\r\nIn due time Douglas Jerrold, as in duty bound, made the _amende\r\nhonorable_ to the sex he had maligned. He was invited to take the chair\r\nat a great public meeting held at Birmingham in his honour, when the\r\nwhole audience rose at him. He was asked to speak without fear, \"as\r\nthere was no Mrs. Caudle in Birmingham.\" He responded that he \"did not\r\nbelieve that there was a Mrs. Caudle in the whole world,\" and the\r\ngracefulness of his reference set him at peace with womankind once more.\r\nIn point of fact, he was no more pleased, artistically, with the success\r\nof Mrs. Caudle among his books than he was pleased with the position of\r\n\"Black-eyed Susan\" among his plays, as he was well aware that he had\r\ndone much better work in both branches. But for _Punch's_ sake he was\r\ndelighted. So after the death of Mrs. Caudle, which in decency could no\r\nlonger be delayed, Jerrold attempted to carry on the idea by marrying\r\nthe widower to the lady of whom his wife had been so jealous; so that\r\nMr. Caudle--his head turned by his new-born liberty--might, in the\r\n\"Breakfast Talk\" levelled at his second spouse, avenge the oppression\r\nhe had suffered from his first. But the experiment, which took place in\r\nthe Almanac of the following year, fell flat, and Mr. and Mrs. Caudle,\r\ntoo, dropped out of Mr. Punch's doll-box for good and all.\r\n\r\nThen followed, in 1846, \"_Punch's_ Complete Letter-writer,\" which in\r\nconsequence of the odium incurred a short time before by Sir James\r\nGraham, the Home Secretary,[38] by the opening of certain letters while\r\nthey were passing through the post, Jerrold sarcastically dedicated to\r\nthe heckled baronet. He did this on the ground that Sir James, having\r\nthe whole run of the Post Office and the fingering of all the letters,\r\nmust therefore possess \"a most refined, most exquisite taste for the\r\ngraces of epistolary composition,\" and could thoroughly appreciate them.\r\nThis was another version of Hood's lines--\r\n\r\n  \"A daw's not reckon'd a religious bird\r\n  Because he keeps a-cawing from a steeple,\"\r\n\r\nand is the pattern on which Mr. Whistler's effort was founded--that the\r\nmere company of pictures can impart no feeling or knowledge of art, else\r\nthe policeman in the National Gallery must be the best of critics. But\r\nat this time better work of Jerrold's, \"St. Giles's and St. James's,\"\r\nwas appearing in his \"Shilling Magazine\" (newly started by Bradbury and\r\nEvans), as well as in the \"Daily News,\" under the title of the \"Hedgehog\r\nPapers;\" while \"Time Works Wonders\" raised his reputation higher than\r\never upon the stage.\r\n\r\nIn the same year appeared the commencement of the series \"Mrs. Bibs'\r\nBaby\"--but it was not a success, and was entirely thrown into the shade,\r\nas it appeared, by Thackeray's first triumph, the \"Snob Papers.\" The\r\nchief charm about \"Mrs. Bibs' Baby\" is that it was the outcome of\r\nJerrold's passionate love of children. This delightful trait in\r\nJerrold's character--as in Steele's, Fielding's, Goldsmith's, and\r\nDickens's--has been common to many of the _Punch_ Staff, as we know in\r\ntheir lives and have seen in their works. We all know how Thackeray\r\nnever saw a boy without wanting to tip him--a practical form of sympathy\r\nwhich found great approval. Leech loved all children, even the terrible\r\nones, and makes us feel it in his drawings. Mr. du Maurier adores the\r\nnice and the pretty ones, and even has a fatherly sort of pity for the\r\nstupid and the ugly. Mr. Harry Furniss's \"Romps\" reflects his keen\r\ndelight in young people, the wilder the better. Shirley Brooks loved to\r\nread the \"Jabberwock\" to them, and Sir John Tenniel, like his old chief,\r\nMark Lemon, loved them for their childhood's sake--or he would never\r\nhave been able to give us \"Alice in Wonderland.\" Of course, there may be\r\nothers on the Staff who have no particularly pronounced feeling in this\r\ndirection; but Jerrold would often go out of his way to introduce babies\r\ninto his serious articles. He speaks somewhere of something \"sweeter\r\nthan the sweetest baby\"--and once said that \"children are earthly idols\r\nthat hold us from the stars.\" So he began \"Mrs. Bibs' Baby,\" and felt\r\nhumiliated and disappointed when the public showed no glimmer of\r\ninterest in it, and he was soon induced by his own good sense and the\r\neditorial hint to desert his latest offspring.\r\n\r\nThen came \"The Female Robinson Crusoe,\" and the last (modified) success,\r\n\"Twelve Fireside Saints;\" but outside undertakings were almost\r\nmonopolising his attention. His \"Weekly Newspaper,\" founded on the\r\nstrength of his \"Q Papers,\" had been born and was already dead. His\r\npowerful novel \"A Man Made of Money\" made his next unqualified success;\r\nthen in 1850 he became attached to the \"Examiner,\" and two years later\r\n\"Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper\" brought him an editorship and a thousand\r\npounds a year--and he knew at last, and for the first time, the meaning\r\nof freedom from care. He became, moreover, independent of the publishers\r\nof _Punch_, to whom he was pecuniarily indebted, although they had more\r\nthan once raised his salary (once in order to enable him to dispense\r\nwith working for the \"Pictorial Times\"); but his indebtedness he felt as\r\na tie, which was none the less irksome that it was a golden fetter which\r\nbound him to his friends. Still, to the end he sent in his satires,\r\ncouplets, and epigrams--stinging, brilliant, and original--jokes and\r\nsarcasms by the score, but extremely few puns.\r\n\r\nSometimes, reviving the memories of his early trade, he would enter the\r\ncompositors' room, and, while waiting for a proof, would seize a\r\n\"stick,\" set up some concluding lines or a fresh paragraph in type, and\r\neven make his own corrections in proof, almost driving the \"reader\" out\r\nof his mind, until he learned how the corrections and additions had been\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nThat Jerrold's wit ran in a higher groove than mere verbal quips and\r\ncranks is proved by the retorts and epigrams that have been preserved\r\nand ticketed in cases like a collection of brilliant butterflies. When\r\none March or April he tumbled backwards into water where, but for the\r\nunseasonable weather, no water ought to have been, he suggested that the\r\naccident was \"owing to the backward spring;\" reminding us of that\r\nsimilar witticism of Henry Compton's, when fine hot weather followed\r\nsuddenly on March snows--\"We have jumped from winter to summer without a\r\nspring.\" His reply was characteristic to the poet Héraud's enquiry as to\r\nwhether he had seen his \"Descent into Hell\" (then newly published)--\"I\r\nwish to Heaven I had;\" together with his well-known retort to Albert\r\nSmith, who, before he left the paper, protested coaxingly against\r\nJerrold's merciless chaff, adding, \"After all, you know, we row in the\r\nsame boat.\" \"True,\" answered Jerrold, quick as thought, \"but not with\r\nthe same skulls.\"\r\n\r\nBut he did not always come off scot-free; and, like many a wit whose\r\ntongue is feared, he could be silenced by a well-directed thrust which,\r\nfor want of practice and experience in defence, he knew not how to\r\nparry. Mr. Charles Williams tells me the story, recounted to him by\r\nThackeray, of how, when one wet night they were all at a little\r\noyster-shop then facing the Strand Theatre, the barmaid Jane, thoroughly\r\nout of humour at Jerrold's chaff, slapped down before the little man the\r\nliquor he had ordered, with the words, \"There's your grog and take care\r\nyou don't drown yourself;\" with the effect of damping his spirits for\r\nthe rest of the night. When Alfred Bunn retaliated with \"A Word with\r\nPunch,\"[39] Jerrold made no reply, to the astonished delight of the\r\nrival press. No man had greater courage than he; but he probably found\r\nthat he had nothing more to say, seeing that from week to week for years\r\npast he had written against Bunn all he knew or could think of. And when\r\nShirley Brooks struck at him in \"The Man in the Moon\" in the course of a\r\nmock election-address beginning--\"I hate the humbug of the 'wrongs of\r\nthe poor man' class of writing when any sneaking rascal is found\r\npoaching and punished for it\"--Jerrold held his peace, and in due time\r\nvoted to have the damaging assailant invited to join _Punch's_ Staff.\r\nMrs. Landells, without straining their friendship, called him \"the\r\nlittle wasp\" to his face; but, as Leigh Hunt more justly said, if he had\r\nthe sting of the bee, he also had the honey. When Jerrold said in his\r\nwife's presence that a man ought to be able to change a spouse like a\r\nbank-note--change one of forty for two of twenty--he indulged in kindly\r\nchaff which she well understood and could appreciate; and when, on the\r\noccasion of a party at their house, he replied to a question as to who\r\nwas dancing with his wife, \"Oh, a member of the Humane Society, I\r\nsuppose,\" she had no objection to Leech making it into a picture for\r\n_Punch's_ pages. When Jerrold said anything witty he would always laugh\r\nfrankly and unreservedly at it, and, like Dickens, he would burst out\r\nlaughing as he wrote, when he struck upon a comic idea for _Punch_.\r\n\r\nThe report that Mark Lemon said of Douglas Jerrold that \"he was\r\ndoubtless considered caustic because he blackened every character he\r\ntouched\" is probably apocryphal--though Jerrold's occasional treatment\r\nof Lemon might perhaps have justified some sort of retaliation from his\r\ngenial Editor. Still, it was Jerrold's firm belief, as he declared to\r\nMr. Sidney Cooper, R.A., that he had never in his life said or written a\r\nbitter thing of anyone who did not deserve it. But when he was on his\r\ndeath-bed, the day before he died, he sent a last affectionate message\r\nto his old comrades at the Table: \"Tell the dear boys that if I've ever\r\nwounded any of them, I've always loved them.\" Horace Mayhew was with him\r\nwhen he passed away, and thence from the bedside brought the dead man's\r\nlove to them as a token to wipe out the sting of words which, if they\r\nhad not been forgotten, had been forgiven long ago.\r\n\r\nAfter 1848 Jerrold wrote less and less for _Punch_; but until 1857, the\r\nyear of his death, he faithfully attended at the Table, and exerted\r\nhimself in _Punch's_ behalf. And when he died--the greatest blow _Punch_\r\nhad hitherto suffered by death (for Dr. Maginn was never on the\r\nStaff)--Henry Mayhew (his son-in-law), Thackeray, Horace Mayhew, Mark\r\nLemon, and W. Bradbury were his pall-bearers, and Leech, Shirley\r\nBrooks, Tom Taylor, John Oxenford, Percival Leigh, James Hannay,\r\nLandells, Kenny Meadows, Albert Smith, and John Tenniel attended at his\r\ngraveside. Dickens took a prominent part in raising a fund for the\r\nbenefit of the widow, and with Thackeray and Dr. W. H. (now Sir William)\r\nRussell gave readings, while Dickens' Amateurs made a public appearance,\r\nand T. P. Cooke returned to the stage for the occasion--with a result\r\namounting to £2,000. Tom Taylor's feeling address, which was spoken at\r\nthe Adelphi Theatre by Albert Smith, between whom and Jerrold a kindlier\r\nfeeling had latterly sprung up, concluded thus:--\r\n\r\n                                  \"... If one joy\r\n  From earth can reach souls freed from earth's alloy,\r\n  'Tis sure the joy to know kind hands are here\r\n  Drying the widow's and the orphan's tear;\r\n  Helping them gently o'er lone life's rough ways,\r\n  Sending what light may be to darkling days--\r\n  A better service than to hang with verse,\r\n  As our forefathers did, the poet's hearse.\r\n\r\n  Two things our Jerrold left, by death removed--\r\n  The works he wrought: the family he loved.\r\n  The first to-night you honour; honouring these,\r\n  You lend your aid to give the others ease.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] Dr. Strauss's attribution of this repartee to Robert Brough in\r\nreproof of James Hannay appears to be quite without foundation.\r\n\r\n[38] See p. 113 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[39] See p. 227 _et seq._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n_PUNCH'S_ WRITERS: 1841-2.\r\n\r\n     Percival Leigh--His Medical Shrewdness--Unsuspected Wealth--His\r\n     Ability and Work--His Decay--Kindness of the Proprietors to the Old\r\n     Pensioner--Albert Smith--Inspires varied Sentiments--Jerrold's\r\n     Hostility--\"Lord Smith\"--Parts Company--H.

He was twenty-four when, in 1835,\r\nhe took his M.R.C.S. He had been a medical student of \"Bart's,\" but had\r\nalready abandoned, in great measure, the lancet for the pen. He sent in\r\nas his first contribution the article to accompany Leech's \"Foreign\r\nAffairs;\" and though he became best known as a humorist, as a doctor he\r\nwas in his early days equally to be respected. Mr. Arthur à Beckett\r\ntells the following stories of his powers in the direction of diagnosis\r\nand surgery:--\r\n\r\n     Although he had given up practice for a number of years, he was an\r\n     excellent doctor. Sir James Paget has told me that when he and \"the\r\n     Professor\" [Leigh's nickname at the Table] were fellow-students at\r\n     \"Bart's,\" the latter was considered quite the best man of his year.\r\n     He was admirable at diagnosis, and I shall never forget one of his\r\n     prognostications. He was in the company of a number of\r\n     _littérateurs_ and artists who were dining together. A well-known\r\n     dramatist was expected, and did not turn up to time. The absentee\r\n     was allowed ten minutes' grace, and then dinner was commenced\r\n     without him. After a while he came in full of apologies. He had\r\n     missed one train (he lived in the suburbs), and would have missed\r\n     another had he not run for it. And then he laughingly explained to\r\n     \"the Professor\" that he thought he had sprained his leg. Percival\r\n     Leigh, who had been looking at him with keen attention since his\r\n     entrance, asked him a couple of questions; and having received\r\n     replies to them, spoke as follows: \"My dear fellow, if you will\r\n     take my advice, you will go home at once in a cab and get to bed.\r\n     Send for your doctor and make him overhaul you. But call special\r\n     attention to the sprain.\" The dramatist, who was one of \"the\r\n     Professor's\" oldest friends, obeyed orders and departed. Then the\r\n     rest of the company twitted the doctor on the clever ruse \"of\r\n     getting rid of one who deserved to be punished for keeping the soup\r\n     waiting.\" Of course, it was only chaff, but \"the Professor\" took it\r\n     seriously. \"No, my boys,\" he replied, very gravely, \"I did not send\r\n     him away on our account, but in his own interest. Of course, while\r\n     there is life there is hope; but, unless I am very greatly\r\n     mistaken, we shall never see him again.\" And \"the Professor\" was\r\n     right. Within a month the dramatist had joined the silent majority.\r\n\r\n     The second story about my dear old friend is not so grim as its\r\n     predecessor.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Percival Leigh, when he was more than seventy years old, was\r\n     knocked down by a passing vehicle as he was crossing the road. He\r\n     was immediately picked up by a policeman and conveyed in a cab to\r\n     the nearest hospital. \"The Professor,\" who was covered in mud,\r\n     asked to be taken home, but the constable would not listen to him.\r\n     So he was carried into the accident ward. After a while he was seen\r\n     by the house-surgeon and his assistant. The two medicos entirely\r\n     ignored \"the Professor,\" and gave their exclusive attention to his\r\n     leg. \"I think you are wrong,\" said Mr. Leigh, in a mild tone of\r\n     voice, after he had listened to their conversation for a few\r\n     moments. The doctors paid not the slightest attention to the\r\n     observation, and continued their investigations. Now \"the\r\n     Professor\" was the most mild and kindly of gentlemen--courteous to\r\n     a degree, and as polished as a traditional Frenchman--but when he\r\n     was roused he was--well, emphatically roused. He attempted a second\r\n     remonstrance, but with the same result. The two medicos calmly\r\n     ignored him. \"Drop that leg, you confounded blockheads!\" he\r\n     thundered out suddenly. \"Can't you see, you idiots, that I have\r\n     fractured my ----,\" and then he supplied a highly technical and\r\n     scientific description of his accident. The two medicos stared at\r\n     \"the Professor\" in blank astonishment. Then \"the Professor\"\r\n     abandoned his incognito, and gave his name and quality. \"You see,\r\n     gentlemen,\" he said, resuming his customary courteous tone, \"I\r\n     venture to believe that I know more about my leg than you do. It\r\n     has been under my personal observation all my life, and I\r\n     consequently have given more time to studying its constitution and\r\n     idiosyncracies than you, naturally (with all your numerous\r\n     engagements), could afford to devote to such a purpose!\"\r\n\r\nLeigh had a philosopher's head and a fine face. In later life he was\r\nextremely careless in his person--so much so that when he died Mr.\r\nBradbury, with his usual thoughtfulness, went to the funeral with a\r\ncheque-book in his pocket, intending, if necessary, to pay the\r\nundertaker's expenses. His surprise, therefore, was great when he\r\nlearned that \"the Professor\" had died worth from ten to eleven thousand\r\npounds. Leigh, who lived for some years in Hammersmith Road, in a house\r\nwhich, judged from its exterior, promised little comfort within, was a\r\nprofound Shakespearean and a good classical scholar, and from these\r\nattainments he earned the sobriquet by which he was known. He vied with\r\nJerrold himself in his knowledge of the Bard, and was fond of spouting\r\nthe poets, classic and English, with the least possible excuse, breaking\r\nout into verse with a loud voice, utterly oblivious of his companions.\r\nIt was he who introduced into the pages of _Punch_ the assumption of\r\nscholarship in its readers, and so acquired at once for the paper a\r\nposition never held by any other humorous journal in this country. His\r\nwork, which for many years averaged a column and a half each week,\r\nincluded nearly every sort of contribution known to _Punch_, including,\r\nin 1845, his striking \"Pauper Song\"--the wail of the poor man who\r\nprefers the prison to the workhouse, the second stanza running thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"There shall I get the larger crust,\r\n    The warmer house-room there;\r\n  And choose a prison since I must,\r\n    I'll choose it for its fare.\r\n  The Dog will snatch the biggest bone,\r\n    So much the wiser he:\r\n  Call me a Dog;--the name I'll own:--\r\n    The gaol--the gaol for me.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1843 Leigh began his effectively satirical \"_Punch's_ Labours of\r\nHercules,\" and in 1849 \"Mr. Pipps's Diary\" appeared as the text\r\naccompanying Doyle's pictures of \"Ye Manners and Customs of ye\r\nEnglyshe.\" The extraordinary success of this admirable parody was,\r\nperhaps, the greatest he ever won, though he achieved many. He was\r\nessentially a \"safe man\" at his work, and for that reason he would act\r\nas _locum tenens_ to Shirley Brooks when that Editor was away; and the\r\nonly occasions on which he failed (so far as I can ascertain) except\r\ntowards the end, was in May, 1847, when his wife died, and in April of\r\nthe following year, when he lost his father. He always had a strong\r\nfeeling for art, both in subject and treatment, and was always very\r\nfastidious about his work; he would touch up a poem over and over again,\r\nand take the utmost pains with metre and \"swing\" until he was satisfied.\r\n\r\nBut as he grew old it became evident that the \"Professor\" was beyond his\r\nwork, and although he attended the Table with the utmost regularity up\r\nto the very end, the decay of nature robbed him of his value as a member\r\nof the Staff. Then came an example of the kindliness of spirit that has\r\nanimated for so long the little côterie of humorists of Bouverie Street\r\nand the generosity of the men for whom they work. For a long while\r\nbefore his death \"the Professor's\" copy had been practically useless to\r\nthe Editor; yet everything was done to spare him the pain of rejection.\r\nAt first Mr. Burnand or Mr. Arthur à Beckett would rewrite the\r\nparagraphs; and Leigh's delight when they were printed was sad to see.\r\nBut soon it was impossible to conceal the fact that they were utterly\r\nuseless; and so for some years it was the practice to set his \"copy\" up\r\nin type and to send him proofs, which he duly corrected and returned.\r\nBut they never appeared in the paper, nor was ever question asked nor\r\nexplanation offered. Did the old gentleman forget all about them? Or was\r\nhe hoping against hope that some day room might again be found for him\r\nin the pages to which he had contributed with so much applause? Or did\r\nhe appreciate the real motive and kindly feeling of the proprietors,\r\nwho, though they could not use his work, actually increased his salary?\r\nWhatever the cause, \"the Professor\" to the last maintained a pathetic\r\nsilence. He died at Oak Cottage, King Street, Hammersmith, on October\r\n24th, 1889, and was laid to rest in the Hammersmith Cemetery in the\r\npresence of a circle of old _Punch_ friends. For one thing, at least, he\r\nhad laid the paper under a deep debt of gratitude--he had introduced to\r\nit his hospital chum and life-long friend, John Leech, and that was a\r\nservice which could never be forgotten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALBERT SMITH.\r\n(_From an Engraving by Cook._)]\r\n\r\nThe third of the medical trio was Albert Smith, a writer who was not\r\nfortunate in making a good impression on the majority of his associates.\r\nWith Leech, with whom he had shared rooms in his \"sawbones days,\" he\r\nremained a steadfast friend; but it is probable that that friendship was\r\nmaintained by the artist by reason of the other's good nature, and in\r\nspite of his manner. Henry Vizetelly, who evidently bore him no\r\nparticular goodwill, wrote to me his recollections of the man in these\r\nwords: \"He was not the amiable person depicted by Yates in his\r\n'Recollections.' He was vulgar and bumptious in manner until he became\r\npolished by concerting with 'swells' after the success of his\r\nentertainments. He always had a keen eye for the main chance, and never\r\nneglected an opportunity for self-advertisement. Jerrold and Thackeray\r\ndetested him, though only Jerrold showed this openly--which he\r\noccasionally did to Smith's face, in the most offensive manner. Albert\r\nSmith retained his position on _Punch_ for some time after Jerrold's\r\nanimosity had declared itself--first, because his copy was always\r\ncertain; and secondly, because he and Leech were great friends, and\r\nLeech was then a power--though not in the same degree as Jerrold, who\r\nwas almost absolute.\" These strictures are repeated in Vizetelly's\r\nautobiography. Smith's \"Physiologies,\" he says, which were some of them\r\nenlarged from the _Punch_ sketches, brought him great popular favour, in\r\nspite of their slight intrinsic worth. Thackeray was invited by\r\nVizetelly to produce similar sketches at a hundred pounds apiece--which\r\nwas double the amount he was then receiving for the monthly parts of\r\n\"Vanity Fair;\" but he declined to do anything \"in the Albert Smith\r\nline,\" and he similarly refused to write for \"Gavarni in London,\" of\r\nwhich Smith was editor. \"Pigmy as Jerrold physically was, Albert Smith\r\nquailed before him;\" for Jerrold's stinging attacks and repartees were\r\nmerciless. So Smith bought a toy-whip, which he playfully produced to\r\nhis friends with the explanation that he intended to apply it to \"Master\r\nJerrold;\" but he was never known to bring it out in his tormentor's\r\npresence. Jerrold's \"skull\" witticism has already been recorded; and of\r\nthe same kind was his loud enquiry over the _Punch_ dinner-table--when\r\nSmith's obtrusive foible of calling his acquaintances by their\r\nabbreviated Christian names became intolerable--\"I say, Leech, how long\r\nis it necessary for a man to know you before he can call you 'Jack'?\"\r\nWhen Jerrold first saw Smith's initials, he had said that he believed\r\nthey were \"only two-thirds of the truth\"--and he continued to act upon\r\nthe assumption until Smith left _Punch_ and had become a successful\r\n\"Entertainer.\" Then a truce was called, for his Mont Blanc ascent and\r\nthe \"Entertainment\" he made out of it (of which Leech himself said,\r\n\"It's only bad John Parry\") had made of Smith one of the lions of the\r\nday, and of his St. Bernard, which had accompanied him, the most petted\r\nbeast in the metropolis. But to the end he remained, generally speaking,\r\nthe best-abused humorist of his day. He did not even succeed in escaping\r\nthe quiet scorn of his occasional companion, Dickens, whose literary\r\nstyle it was reported he was trying to copy. The novelist, who much\r\nenjoyed Albert's sobriquet of \"Lord Smith,\" simply shrugged his\r\nshoulders as he replied--\"We all have our Smiths.\" It is believed by\r\nthose who should know best that the cause of the final rupture between\r\nSmith and _Punch_ was the discovery that some of his articles were\r\nsimply adaptations from the French; and this belief is still current in\r\nthe _Punch_ office.\r\n\r\nSmith's connection with _Punch_ was through his engagement for the\r\n\"Cosmorama,\" on which Landells and Last committed infanticide at the\r\nstarting of _Punch_. He sent his first paper from his temporary rooms at\r\nChertsey; it was the burlesque, \"Transactions and Yearly Report of the\r\nHookham-cum-Snivey Literary, Scientific, and Mechanics' Institute\" (12th\r\nSeptember, 1841). This was succeeded in the following month, with the\r\nopening of his \"Physiology of a London Medical Student,\" which was\r\nrather laughable in itself, while displaying a wonderful intimacy with\r\nthe rough and noisy world with which it dealt. The idea, however, had\r\nalready been sketched by Percival Leigh in \"The Heads of the People.\"\r\nSmith was now living at 14, Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road, in an\r\nunpalatial lodging, where he nominally carried on the profession of\r\nsurgeon-dentist; but his best energies were thrown into his literary\r\nwork, and there is no doubt that that work was to the taste of the\r\n_Punch_ readers. Mr. Walton Henning has told me how his father, A. S.\r\nHenning, calling upon Smith concerning his work, found him like a\r\ntypical Bob Sawyer, with his heels upon the table, playing the cornet as\r\na grand finale to his breakfast. Then he would don his French workman's\r\nblouse and scribble for dear life. The \"Physiology of London Evening\r\nParties,\" which was originally written by him in 1839 for the \"Literary\r\nWorld,\" was illustrated by Newman, who was still a far more important\r\nman on _Punch_ than Leech; and the series was followed by \"Curiosities\r\nof Medical Experiences,\" the less successful \"Side-scenes of Everyday\r\nSociety,\" and \"Physiology of a London Idler\"--which, taken together,\r\nwere voted the most entertaining descriptions of social life that\r\n_Punch_ was publishing, even at a time when _Punch_ was declared to be\r\nvastly entertaining. Verse, epigram, jokelets, and articles on current\r\nevents came from Albert Smith's pen before the strained relations\r\nbetween the parties and the irresistible hostility of Jerrold bore him\r\ndown, though it is probable that the practical joke on him described\r\namong the proceedings of the _Punch_ Club had some part in bringing\r\nmatters to a head; and on January 7th, 1844, his last contribution\r\nappeared--\"Important and Telegraphic.\" _Punch_, in reply to a criticism\r\nof the \"Boston Atlas,\" declared that Smith left in December, 1843; but\r\nAlbert Smith himself wrote (November 20th, 1845) to Mr. James Silk\r\nBuckingham (who was protesting to him against _Punch's_ attacks): \"I\r\nhave not written or suggested anything for _Punch_ since January,\r\n1844.... I withdrew in consequence of being unable to agree with Mr.\r\nMark Lemon, the editor. Indeed, I have been attacked since then through\r\nmy novel of 'The Marchioness of Brinvilliers' both in _Punch_ and in\r\n'Jerrold's Magazine,' for which I do not care a straw.\"\r\n\r\nIt was after his retirement from _Punch_ that, in conjunction with A. B.\r\nReach, he started \"The Man in the Moon,\" with the express purpose of\r\nmaking himself obnoxious to _Punch_ in general and Jerrold in\r\nparticular, in which laudable desire he in part, at least, succeeded;\r\nwhile at the same time he turned his attention to the publishers by\r\nbringing out a little Christmas volume entitled \"A Bowl of _Punch_.\" But\r\nin time all bitterness disappeared; Albert the Great, as Smith was\r\ncalled, had \"discovered\" Mont Blanc and Chamonix, and peace prevailed,\r\nthough to the end Smith had no further access to _Punch's_ pages.\r\n\r\nThe last regular contributor of the year 1841 whose name has been\r\npreserved is H. A. Kennedy, whose parodies of Horace were as good as\r\nanything Leigh ever did of the kind. The parody of Horace's \"Donec\r\ngratus\" is worth preserving, and that (p. 20, Volume II.) of \"Ad\r\nLydiam\"--becomingly rendered into a tender ode \"To Judy\"--is hardly\r\nless excellent.\r\n\r\nDr. Maginn's connection with _Punch_ began with the first Almanac, while\r\nhe was, with James Hannay, in residence in the \"Fleet.\" The doctor, as\r\none of the most versatile writers of the day, was looked upon by\r\nthe \"Punchites\" as useful for their purpose as he was for any of\r\nthe rival papers with which he was connected. \"He would write a leader\r\nfor the 'Standard' one evening,\" it is said in J. F. Clarke's\r\n\"Auto-biographical Recollections,\" \"answer it in the 'True Sun' the\r\nfollowing day, and abuse both in the 'John Bull' on the ensuing Sunday.\"\r\nSuch a man could not be without a sense of humour, especially with ample\r\ngin and water to enrich it and poverty to point it. He was the brilliant\r\nMorgan O'Doherty of \"Fraser\" and \"Blackwood,\" and was nearly, but not\r\nquite, \"Captain Shandon\" in \"Pendennis.\" Thackeray had an affectionate\r\nadmiration for his talents. But the times and the doctor were out of\r\ngear; he lost sympathy through his persecution of \"L.E.L.,\" and his\r\nmisfortunes led him to follow a class of journalism out of all\r\nconsonance with his powers and better feeling; he is credited with\r\nhaving been the forerunner of scurrilous society-journalism. But no hint\r\nof these defects is apparent in his work for _Punch_, in which, perhaps,\r\nhe saw an opportunity for some degree of re-instatement; and he conveyed\r\nhis gratitude in a five-stanza poem in praise of the paper (p. 131, Vol.\r\nII.), \"Verses by a Bard--Much be-rhymed in _Punch_.\" But he was near his\r\nend; and when he died a year afterwards, _Punch_ devoted to him the\r\nfirst of his little black-bordered obituaries.\r\n\r\nThe year 1842 was the stormiest and most threatening in _Punch's_\r\nhistory; so that, with an empty till and growing liabilities, there was\r\nno disposition towards introducing new contributors involving the\r\nprinciple of \"cash down.\" Only three names belong to this year, but all\r\nwere men of great importance, each in his own line--John Oxenford, W. M.\r\nThackeray, and Horace Mayhew. In common with Coyne, Oxenford had a\r\nstronger sympathy for the stage than for periodical literature, so that\r\nafter the tenth volume he ceased to be even an occasional contributor.\r\nHis first paper was \"Herr Döbler and the Candle Counter.\" The popular\r\nconjurer had advertised that to begin his performance and illumine his\r\nstage he would light two hundred candles by a single pistol-shot. (This\r\nwas in the very early days of practical electricity.) The \"Times\" had\r\nreported the entertainment, but complained that, having counted the\r\nnumber of candles, they found there were only eighty-seven!--whereupon\r\nOxenford executed a literary dance upon the \"Times\" reporter.\r\nThenceforward, he contributed with some degree of regularity. After his\r\n\"Christmas Game\" (January 6th, 1844) he was, on the 3rd of the following\r\nyear, accounted upon the regular Staff, although from that time he did\r\nbut little. Verse, clever and bright, burlesque, and the like, in the\r\ntrue spirit of _Punch_, came from time to time; but there was not enough\r\nof his work to place him in rank with the chief of the contributors.\r\n\"There is one,\" Mr. Jabez Hogg reminds me, \"whose name is rarely\r\nmentioned in connection with the early days of _Punch_ and the\r\n'Illustrated London News.' I refer to John Oxenford. He did much good\r\nwork in his day, and his contributions to _Punch_ assisted greatly to\r\nincrease its reputation. He was a wit of the first water.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN OXENFORD.\r\n(_From a Photograph by Fradelle and Young._)]\r\n\r\nThe same number that introduced John Oxenford to the _Punch_ reader\r\npresented also William Makepeace Thackeray--a connection that did not\r\nimmediately attract public notice, perhaps, though it soon bore the\r\nrichest fruit for both author and publisher.\r\n\r\nIt was about seven years after the first abortive attempt to found a\r\n\"London Charivari\" that Thackeray--who had been one of the\r\nband--commenced that connection with _Punch_ which was to be of equal\r\nadvantage both to him and the paper. \"It was a good day for himself, the\r\njournal, and the world,\" said Shirley Brooks, \"when Thackeray found\r\n_Punch_. At first,\" continues his biographer, \"I should gather that he\r\nhad doubts as to the advisability of joining in the new and, so far, not\r\nvery promising venture;\" and on the 22nd of May, 1842, we find\r\nFitzgerald uttering a warning note, and writing to a common friend:\r\n\"Tell Thackeray not to go to _Punch_ yet.\" But his friend paid little\r\nheed to the counsel, for within a month appeared what I am satisfied is\r\nThackeray's first contribution to _Punch_--\"The Legend of\r\nJawbrahim-Heraudee\" (p. 254, first volume for 1842) with a sketch\r\nundoubtedly by his hand; and at the beginning of the very next volume, a\r\nfortnight later, was begun the series entitled \"Miss Tickletoby's\r\nLectures on English History.\" These, continued for a time, made no sort\r\nof hit, and in due course they were discontinued; but there seems to\r\nhave been in them, and especially in the sketches, the germ of the idea,\r\nso perfectly worked out a little later by Gilbert à Beckett and\r\nLeech--though not for _Punch_: \"The Comic History of England\" and \"The\r\nComic History of Rome.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Thackeray joined the _Punch_ circle--or, rather, when he first\r\nwrote for it, for he was not on the Staff for some little time--he\r\nentered, with the credentials of \"Fraser\" and the \"Irish Sketch Book,\"\r\ninto a company of which several members were already his friends, who,\r\nknowing him as a humorist with both pen and pencil, were glad to secure\r\nso useful a man as contributor. \"Very early in the work,\" writes\r\nLandells in his private papers, which lie before me, \"Mr. Mayhew was\r\ndesirous to secure his co-operation, and it was rather singular that the\r\nfirst paper which the great man contributed to _Punch_ was rejected as\r\nunsuitable.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. M. THACKERAY.\r\n(_From a Private Photograph._)]\r\n\r\nThis was hardly correct: it would be more accurate to say that the first\r\nextended series was suddenly cut short. The circumstances of the\r\nextinction of Miss Tickletoby are shown in the following letter by\r\nThackeray, which has been placed at my disposal by Messrs. Bradbury and\r\nAgnew:--\r\n\r\n                                             Halverstown, Kildare,\r\n                                                   Sept. 27, 1842.\r\nGENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nYour letter, containing an enclosure of £25, has been forwarded to me,\r\nand I am obliged to you for the remittance. Mr. Lemon has previously\r\nwritten to me to explain the delay, and I had also received a letter\r\nfrom Mr. Landells, who told me, what I was sorry to learn, that you were\r\ndissatisfied with my contributions to \"Punch.\" I wish that my writings\r\nhad the good fortune to please everyone; but all I can do, however, is\r\nto do my best, which has been done in this case, just as much as if I\r\nhad been writing for any more dignified periodical.\r\n\r\nBut I have no wish to continue the original agreement made between us,\r\nas it is dissatisfactory to you and, possibly, injurious to your work;\r\nand shall gladly cease Mrs. [_sic_] Tickletoby's Lectures, hoping that\r\nyou will be able to supply her place with some more amusing and lively\r\ncorrespondent.\r\n\r\nI shall pass the winter either in Paris or in London where, very\r\nprobably, I may find some other matter more suitable to the paper, in\r\nwhich case I shall make another attempt upon \"Punch.\"--Meanwhile,\r\ngentlemen, I remain, your very obedient Servant,\r\n\r\nW. M. THACKERAY.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, and by sure degrees, Thackeray fell into the spirit\r\nof the paper, and became known to the general public first as a \"_Punch_\r\nman,\" and then as \"_the Punch_ man,\" and for some time recognised by\r\nthat, rather than by his work in other directions. He became more and\r\nmore highly appreciated as one of those who contributed to that\r\nspeciality of humour for which _Punch_ had already established a\r\nreputation while creating a demand. All the while, during the first ten\r\nyears, he regarded the paper as a sort of stepping-stone to an\r\nindependent literary position; and he was not very long in using his\r\nopportunity for making a reputation equal to that of Jerrold\r\nhimself--but a literary, and in no sense a political one. Jerrold, whose\r\ninfluence was political quite as much as literary and dramatic,\r\nundoubtedly did a good deal of unconscious service in spurring Thackeray\r\nwith the spirit of emulation. It has already been pointed out how little\r\nlove was lost between the two men at the weekly Dinner, and how Jerrold\r\nsped his galling little shafts of clever personalities at Carlyle's\r\n\"half-monstrous Cornish giant;\" how, in short, they were, and remained\r\nto the end, the friendliest and most amiable of enemies.\r\n\r\nVizetelly has recorded how Thackeray would tear the postal-wrapper\r\nnervously from the newly-delivered _Punch_ in order to \"see what Master\r\nDouglas has to say this week\"--(there is a world of dislike and scorn in\r\nthat courtesy-title of \"Master\")--and how, when he gave a lunch in\r\nhonour of the French humorous draughtsman \"Cham,\" he invited \"Big\"\r\nHiggins, Tom Taylor, Richard Doyle, and Leech, all _Punch_ men, to meet\r\nhim, but neither Mark Lemon nor Jerrold, for \"Young Douglas, if asked,\r\nwould most likely not come; but if he did, he'd take especial care that\r\nhis own effulgence should obscure all lesser lights.\" It was not\r\nArcedeckne, I am assured by Mr. Cuthbert Bradley (\"Cuthbert Bede's\"\r\nson), but Jerrold, who, in Mark Lemon's hearing, crushingly criticised\r\nThackeray's first public reading to the lecturer's face, with the\r\nlaconic remark, \"Wants a piano!\" Thackeray, as we all know, was free\r\nenough himself in his criticisms of his own features, and his many\r\nsketches of his dear old broken nose are familiar enough to every lover\r\nof the man. Yet he was not best pleased when he entered the _Punch_\r\ndining-room a little late, apologising for his unpunctuality through\r\nhaving been detained at a christening, at which he had stood sponsor to\r\nhis friend's boy, to be met with Jerrold's pungent exclamation--\"Good\r\nLord, Thackeray! I hope you didn't present the child with your own mug!\"\r\nAnd still less was he flattered when he heard that, on its being\r\nreported in the _Punch_ office that he was \"turning Roman,\" simply\r\nbecause he defended Doyle's secession, Jerrold tartly remarked that\r\n\"he'd best begin with his nose.\" (Jerrold, by the way, uses the same\r\nconceit in a letter to Sir Charles Dilke when repeating a rumour of the\r\nattempted conversion of the novelist by \"Lady ----.\") These and many more\r\nsardonic thrusts would amply account for Thackeray's dislike; yet that\r\nthe men's relations were not half so disagreeable as has generally been\r\nbelieved is shown by the fact of Thackeray coming up specially to town\r\nfrom his lecturing tour in order to support Jerrold on the night of his\r\nelection at the Reform Club, and delightedly exclaiming, when the result\r\nwas known--\"We've got the little man in!\" Nor would he, perhaps, have\r\nshown himself and Jerrold, in the accompanying cut, listening in\r\nfraternal shame-facedness and disgust to a fellow-passenger declaiming\r\nagainst the wickedness and profanity of _Punch_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAITS OF THACKERAY AND JERROLD.\r\n(_Drawn by W. M. Thackeray._)\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S MISERIES, NO. VI.\r\n\r\nOld gentleman. Miss Wiggets. Two authors.\r\n\r\n_Old gentleman:_ \"I am sorry to see you occupied, my dear Miss Wiggets,\r\nwith that trivial paper _Punch_. A railway is not a place, in my\r\nopinion, for jokes.

I have it from the best authority that they\r\nmeet together once a week in a tavern in St. Giles's, where they concoct\r\ntheir infamous print. The chief part of their income is derived from\r\nthreatening letters which they send to the nobility and gentry. The\r\nprincipal writer is a returned convict. Two have been tried at the Old\r\nBailey; and their artist--as for their artist....\"\r\n\r\n_Guard:_ \"Swin-dun! Sta-tion!\" (_Punch_, p. 198, Vol. XV., 1848.)]\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, one of Thackeray's strong points on the Staff was\r\nthat he was a \"pen-and-pencil man,\" that he worked indifferently as\r\nartist or as writer, and not only as a writer, but as a prose-and-poem\r\nman. It has been said, with authority, that Thackeray never illustrated\r\nany articles but his own; but that is wholly incorrect. If you open\r\nVolume VIII., at p. 266, you will find a drawing of his showing Jack Tar\r\nand his Poll waltzing an accompaniment to an article on the \"Debate on\r\nthe Navy,\" which was written by Gilbert à Beckett. To the same writer's\r\nchapter on \"The Footman,\" in his series of \"_Punch's_ Guide to Servants\"\r\n(p. 40, Volume IX.), is a characteristic illustration by Thackeray, and\r\nagain on the following page to \"The Gomersal Museum.\" A little farther\r\non, on p. 56, is a clever cut of a lovers' _tête-à-tête_ beside a\r\ntea-table, to accompany Percival Leigh's ballad of \"The Lowly Bard to\r\nhis Lady Love;\" and many similar results will reward a more extended\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\nThackeray's own opinion of his powers as a draughtsman is not easy to\r\ndetermine. We know, of course, from his own lips, his (? affected)\r\nsurprise at Dickens not finding his art good enough to illustrate\r\n\"Pickwick\" _vice_ Seymour, deceased. But in the interval between this\r\napplication in 1836 and his later work he probably came to a more\r\ncritical estimate of the real value of his draughtsmanship--that work\r\nwhich had been so laboriously and earnestly evolved from his studies in\r\nthe Louvre and elsewhere. When Vizetelly was engraving Thackeray's\r\ndesigns to \"Mrs. Perkin's Ball,\" which on account of their\r\nunsophisticated artistic character, were re-touched by a clever young\r\ndraughtsman, the artist wrote that there was a \"je ne sais quoi\" in his\r\n\"vile drawing\" which was worth retaining. \"Somehow,\" he said, \"I prefer\r\nmy Nuremberg dolls to Mr. Thwaites's superfine wax models.\" After Edmund\r\nYates had started that brilliant little journal or magazine, which was\r\nnot destined, however, to live as long as it deserved, Thackeray wrote\r\nto him: \"You have a new artist on 'The Train,' I see, my dear Yates. I\r\nhave been looking at his work, and I have solved a problem. I find there\r\n_is_ a man alive who draws worse than myself!\" Yet he continued to draw\r\nfor _Punch_ with zeal; but when an acquaintance told him, probably in\r\nall sincerity, \"but you _can_ draw,\" Thackeray brusquely put down the\r\ncompliment to the toadyism of a \"snob.\" Trollope declares that Thackeray\r\n\"never learned to draw--perhaps, never could have learned;\" but he did\r\nnot see that in the art of illustration, especially of a humorous\r\ncharacter, there is something more important than academic correctness\r\nand technical mastery. He moved his pencil slowly, with a deliberate\r\nbroad touch, without haste, and with no more attempt at refinement than\r\nwas natural to him. Yet his hand was capable of astonishing delicacy of\r\ntouch; and I have seen the Lord's Prayer written by him one day at the\r\n_Punch_ Table, within the space of a threepenny-piece, which is a marvel\r\nof legibility. There is a character about Thackeray's work--his \"je ne\r\nsais quoi\"--that makes us forgive him his glaring faults--indeed, we\r\nalmost come to love him for them--when once we have frankly recognised\r\nthat it was in great measure his facility in drawing that was his\r\nartistic ruin. There is always something of the caricaturist in his most\r\nserious and important sketches--most of all, perhaps, in his etchings.\r\nIt is in his smallest cuts that he is seen to the best advantage, and in\r\nthem he occasionally challenges comparison with Doyle and Leech himself.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of his _Punch_ sketches, in nearly all the three\r\nhundred and eighty of them, Thackeray was as summary as in the turning\r\nof a ballad, and I describe elsewhere how he would make a drawing on the\r\nwood while the engraver waited and chatted over a cigar. It was clearly\r\nnot his opinion that, as is nowadays adjudged to be the proper course,\r\nelaborate studies should first be made from the life-model, even for\r\nthe execution of a simple _Punch_ picture. He preferred, when possible,\r\nto confine his pencil to the illustration of his own text; but on\r\noccasion he would produce a \"social\" cut--a drawing, that is to say,\r\nwith a joke printed beneath. Sometimes it would be in the manner of\r\nLeech, as in the joke in Volume IX. (p. 3) called \"The Ascot Cup Day,\"\r\nwherein a hot-potato-seller asks a small boy with a broom, \"Why are you\r\non the crossing, James? Is your father Hill?\" and is informed \"No. He's\r\ndrove mother down to Hascot.\" More personal was such work as \"The Stags,\r\na Drama of To-day,\" in which a retired thimblerigger and an unfortunate\r\ncostermonger, under a magnificent alias, take advantage of the railway\r\nmania to make their application for shares--for which they could not\r\npay, of course, if things went wrong--in accordance with the game of\r\n\"heads I win, tails I vanish,\" at that time extensively played\r\nthroughout the country. Later on (in Volume XV.), following \"The\r\nHeavies,\" he gave, in seven scenes, a panorama of an \"Author's\r\nMiseries.\" In 1847 (Volume XII., p. 59) Thackeray contributed a \"social\"\r\npicture which is to this day a wonder to all beholders. It is entitled\r\n\"Horrid Tragedy in Private Life,\" and represents a room in which two\r\nladies, or a lady and a servant, are in a state of the greatest alarm.\r\nWhat the meaning of it all is there is nothing whatever to indicate\r\n(unless it be that something has fallen on the taller lady's dress); and\r\non its appearance the \"Man in the Moon\" offered a reward of £500 and a\r\nfree pardon to anyone who would publish an explanation. The reward was\r\nnever claimed; and Thackeray's contribution remains one of _Punch's_\r\nPrize Puzzles, unsolved, and, apparently, unsolvable.\r\n\r\nIt was in No. 137--that notable part which contained \"The Song of the\r\nShirt\"--that Thackeray appeared in his own right, as belonging not only\r\nto the Staff, but to the Table. The contribution was a \"Singular Letter\r\nfrom the Regent of Spain;\" and with it Thackeray took his place at the\r\nDinner as an excellent substitute for Albert Smith. That writer, who had\r\nfound his successor \"a very jolly fellow with no High Art about him,\"\r\nand a charming companion at \"the Cider Cellars,\" a month later\r\ndisappeared for ever from _Punch_ as a contributor, refiguring only in\r\nits pages from time to time as an object of attack.\r\n\r\nThackeray's work on _Punch_ covered every corner of _Punch's_ field.\r\nBurlesques of history and parodies of literature, ballads and songs,\r\nstories and jokes, papers and paragraphs, pleasantry and pathos,\r\ncriticisms and conundrums, travels in the East and raillery in the\r\nWest, political skits and social satire--from a column to a single\r\nline--such was the sum of Thackeray's contribution to _Punch_. Less\r\nprolific than either Jerrold or Gilbert à Beckett, he produced,\r\nnevertheless, an enormous amount of \"copy\" that was always readable,\r\neven when it was not his best. He wrote from Paris to his friend, Mrs.\r\nBrookfield (September 2nd, 1849): \"I won't give you an historical\r\ndisquisition in the Titmarsh manner upon this, but reserve it for\r\n_Punch_--for whom, on Thursday [I have written] an article that I think\r\nis quite unexampled for dulness, even in that Journal, and that beats\r\nthe dullest Jerrold. What a jaunty, offhand, satiric rogue I am, to be\r\nsure--and a gay young dog!\" But he did not think his work half so\r\nuninteresting as he pretended; he even regarded with satisfaction that\r\nwhich he produced when greatly out of the vein. \"It is but a hasty\r\nletter I send you, my dear lady,\" he wrote to the same correspondent, in\r\n1850, \"but my hand is weary with writing 'Pendennis'--and my head\r\nboiling up with some nonsense that I must do after dinner for _Punch_.\r\nIsn't it strange that, in the midst of all the selfishness, that of\r\ndoing one's business is the strongest of all. What funny songs I've\r\nwritten when fit to hang myself!\"\r\n\r\nHis first contributions to _Punch_, after those already mentioned, were\r\n\"Mr. Spec's Remonstrance,\" Volume IV., p. 70 (omitting \"Assumption of\r\nAristocracy,\" which has hitherto been credited to him, but was really\r\nsent in by Gilbert à Beckett), \"Singular Letter from the Regent of\r\nSpain,\" with the three amusing cuts of sailors who, having found a\r\nbottle at sea, speculate as to its contents as they open it--\"Sherry,\r\nperhaps,\" \"Rum, I hope!\" \"_Tracts, by Jove!!_\" Then, to select the chief\r\nand longest series, came \"The History of the Next French Revolution,\" in\r\nnine parts (Volume VI.), contributions which were leavened by pleasant\r\nattacks levelled at Lytton, and at \"Jenkins\" of the \"Morning Post.\" Then\r\nfollowed, in Volumes VII. and VIII., \"Travelling Notes, by our Fat\r\nContributor\" (for Thackeray loved to call himself so, or \"Our Stout\r\nCommissioner,\" or \"Titmarsh,\" \"Policeman X,\" \"Jeames,\" \"Paul Pindar,\"\r\nor other whimsical pseudonym), and \"Punch in the East\"--the record of a\r\njourney undertaken by Thackeray at the invitation of the P. and O.\r\nCompany, who offered him a free passage to Egypt.\r\n\r\nAt this time the railway mania was at its height, and Thackeray took his\r\nshare in _Punch_ in stemming the fatal tide, so far as ridicule could be\r\nused to do so. One of his first papers on the subject was the \"Letter\r\nfrom Jeames, of Buckly Square,\" signed by \"Fitz-Jeames de la\r\nPluche\"--the famous Jeames who, first created by Thackeray in the pages\r\nof \"The Britannia\" in 1841, under the title of \"Mr. Yellowplush, my\r\nlord's body-servant,\" began in the same Vol. IX. (1845) his immortal\r\n\"Diary.\" One of the successes of this epistle was what, to Thackeray's\r\ndelight, was seriously complained of as the \"deplorable\" inaccurate\r\northography of the illiterate flunkey. Thackeray was certainly not the\r\nfirst to use the device, but he was the first to achieve great success\r\nwith it, and Arthur Sketchley, Artemus Ward, Mr. Deputy Bedford\r\n(\"Robert\"), and all the American humorists who have adopted the same\r\nidea, are but followers where the great Titmarsh led. Jeames's weakness\r\nbecame a strength in Thackeray's hands, and at one time was turned with\r\neffect upon Sir Isaac Pitman's \"Spelling Reform,\" which was then a novel\r\nbutt for the satirist. The incident has been thus gravely recorded in\r\nthe pages of the \"Phonetic Journal\":--\r\n\r\n     \"Ten years ago Mr. Punch had meni a meri kakinashon at the ekspens\r\n     ov Mr. Pitman and the 'Phonetic News,' which he leiked tu kall the\r\n     'Fanatic Nuz.' Here is wun of his sneerz:--'Voltaire sed ov the\r\n     Inglish that they save two ourz a day bei kontrakting all their\r\n     wurdz. The \"Fonetic Nuz\" woz not then in eksistens. If we save two\r\n     ourz,' kontiniuz the kaustik pupet, 'in the dayz ov Voltaire, we\r\n     must save siks ourz at least nou that we hav our improved plan ov\r\n     speling, az originali invented bei Winifred Jenkins, and karid to\r\n     its greatest heit bei Jeames, with the assistans ov Yellowplush and\r\n     Pitman.' But _Punch_, who, leik the 'Thunderer,' never goez agenst\r\n     publik opinion, sneerz no longer at the Speling Reform moovment,\r\n     and sensibel men, who ar not fonetik men at all, admit at last that\r\n     our prezent sistem ov orthografi is bei no meanz perfekt.\"\r\n\r\nThere is little wonder that Thackeray seized on the comic side of this\r\nmovement, for whimsical spelling always delighted him. On one occasion,\r\nindeed, he was so proud of an uncompromising cold that had \"sat down\" in\r\nhis head that he wrote to a friend in these terms:--\"Br. Lettsob\r\n(attaché to the Egglish Legatiob at Washigtol) has beel kild elough to\r\nprobise to dile with be ol _Bulday lext_ at 6 o'clock--if you would joil\r\nhib aid take a portiol of _a plail joilt ald a puddl_, it wd. give great\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Snobs of England\" began in the tenth volume, and continued through\r\nfifty-one numbers well into the twelfth. The effect of these papers was\r\nremarkable; the sensation they caused was profound. It may be compared\r\nto that of Jerrold's \"Caudle Lectures,\" save that they appealed to a\r\nmore cultivated and less demonstrative class, and were appreciated in\r\nproportion to their superior merits. The circulation of _Punch_ rose\r\nsurprisingly under their benign influence, and Thackeray did not leave\r\nthe subject until he had handled it from every point of view and even\r\ncarried it abroad. He was, naturally, not a little proud of his first\r\ngreat success, and in his unaffected manner was tempted to speak about\r\nit in Society--where more than in any other quarter the papers were\r\nappreciated. Unfortunately, according to Dr. Gordon Hake's memoirs,\r\nThackeray broached the subject to George Borrow. He had been trying to\r\nmake conversation with that strangely crotchety man, but had completely\r\nfailed. So, being somewhat embarrassed, he asked him abruptly, \"Have you\r\nread my 'Snob Papers' in _Punch_?\" Borrow seemed to thaw. \"In _Punch_,\"\r\nhe repeated sweetly. \"It is a periodical I never look at.\" This was as\r\nbad as the Oxford University magnate when Thackeray called upon him in\r\n1857 in reference to his lecturing-tour and mentioned his connection\r\nwith _Punch_, the fame of which was great in the land, as a sort of\r\ncertificate of character--\"_Punch_--_Punch_?\" repeated the ignorant\r\nscholar, \"is that not a ribald publication?\" Thackeray, I may add, in\r\norder to impart local colour to his chapters on the Club Snob, with\r\ncharacteristic shrewdness obtained an introduction from Mr. Hampton, the\r\nsecretary of the Conservative Club, to the Secretaries of the Reform\r\nand the Athenæum, and begged their permission to inspect their\r\ncomplaint-books--a fact which has not before been recorded; and from\r\nthem he gained such an insight into the failings of the snobbish\r\nclubman, that that portion of the work is unsurpassed for its truth to\r\nlife. It is generally understood that he took Mr. Stephen Price, of the\r\nGarrick Club, as the model for Captain Shandy, and that his type of the\r\nsporting snob was Mr. Wyndham Smith.\r\n\r\nThere is not much doubt that Thackeray was a little--if ever so\r\nlittle--of a snob himself, and Jerrold's suspicion of him was to that\r\nextent justified. He did not show it so much by going into Society, for,\r\nas he said to a friend, \"If I don't go out and mingle in Society, I\r\ncan't write\"--just as Mr. du Maurier goes out in order to study his\r\nworld, and as Leech rode to hounds for the sake of his health and work.\r\nBut Thackeray, who was the writer of some of the most caustic articles\r\non \"Jenkins\"--(under which name _Punch_ habitually attacked the \"Morning\r\nPost,\" the aristocratic airs of which were to him a perpetual\r\nprovocation)--seemed to take a little more interest in Society than mere\r\ncuriosity or policy required; and was once thrown heavily in an\r\nencounter with the \"Post's\" reporter. Henry Vizetelly retells the story\r\nwell in his \"Looking Back through Seventy Years\":--\r\n\r\n     A favourite butt for Hannay's savage satire was Rumsey Forster--the\r\n     Jenkins of the \"Morning,\" or, as Hannay dubbed it, the \"Fawning\r\n     Post\"--who had supplanted the _ci-devant_ midshipman in the\r\n     affections of some pretty barmaid at a London tavern which they\r\n     both frequented. Forster was most energetic in his particular\r\n     calling, and is said on one occasion to have obtained admission in\r\n     the interests of the \"Morning Post\" to a Waterloo banquet at Apsley\r\n     House, by getting himself up as one of the extra servants out of\r\n     livery, called in to assist on these occasions. He was highly\r\n     indignant with Thackeray for the way in which he persistently\r\n     ridiculed him in _Punch_ under the cognomen of Jenkins; and I\r\n     remember, after the author of \"Vanity Fair\" had become a celebrity,\r\n     and began to be invited by other wearers of purple and fine linen,\r\n     besides Lord Carlisle, to their aristocratic _soirées_, being\r\n     highly amused by Forster telling me how he had taken his revenge.\r\n\r\n     \"You should know, sir,\" he said solemnly, \"that at Stafford House,\r\n     Lady Palmerston's, and the other swell places, a little table is\r\n     set for me just outside the drawing-room doors, where I take down\r\n     the names of the company as these are announced by the attendant\r\n     footmen. Well, Mr. Thackeray was at the Marquis of Lansdowne's the\r\n     other evening, and his name was called out, as is customary;\r\n     nevertheless, I took very good care that it should not appear in\r\n     the list of the company at Lansdowne House, given in the 'Post.' A\r\n     night or two afterwards I was at Lord John Russell's, and Mr.\r\n     Thackeray's name was again announced, and again I designedly\r\n     neglected to write it down; whereupon the author of 'The Snobs of\r\n     England,' of all persons in the world [it must be candidly\r\n     confessed that Thackeray was himself a bit of a tuft-hunter],\r\n     bowed, and bending over me, said: 'Mr. Thackeray;' to which I\r\n     replied: 'Yes, sir, I am quite aware;' nevertheless, the great Mr.\r\n     Thackeray's name did not appear in the 'Post' the following\r\n     morning.\"\r\n\r\nIn another version of the same story it is recorded that when Thackeray\r\npronounced his name to Rumsey Forster, the latter dramatically retorted,\r\n\"And I, sir, am Mr. Jenkins\"--an account far more artistic, if somewhat\r\nless faithful.\r\n\r\nAfter the \"Snobs\" were finished and the evergreen \"Mahogany Tree,\" in\r\nVolume XII., \"_Punch's_ Prize Novelists\" were begun in April, 1847. In\r\ntheir way these parodies have never been excelled, and the fourth of the\r\nseries--\"Phil Fogarty,\" by \"Harry Rollicker\"--was so excellent a\r\nburlesque that Charles Lever, on reading this story of the hero of \"the\r\nfighting onety-oneth,\" good-humouredly declared that he \"might as well\r\nshut up shop;\" and he actually did change, thenceforward, the manner of\r\nhis books. These \"Prize Novels\" continued into the following volume, in\r\nwhich \"Travels in London\" were begun. These ran into Volume XIV., 1848,\r\nin which year their author received from Edinburgh a testimonial from\r\neighty of his Scottish admirers. This took the shape of a silver\r\ninkstand in the form of Mr. Punch's person, and greatly resembled that\r\nwhich a similar subscription had already procured for Mark Lemon. It\r\ndrew from Thackeray a charming letter in acknowledgment. Then followed\r\n\"A Dinner at Timmins's\" (Volumes XIV.-XV.) and \"Bow Street Ballads\"\r\n(Volume XV.), 1848, \"Mr. Brown's Letters to a Man about Town\" (Volume\r\nXVI.), and \"Mr. Brown's Letters to his Son\" (Volume XVII.), 1849; \"The\r\nProser\" (Volumes XVIII.-XIX.), 1850, and \"Important from the Seat of\r\nWar\" (Volumes XXVI.-XXVII.), 1854. These papers, with the exception of\r\n\"Mr. Punch to an Eminent Personage\" (Volume XXVII., p. 110) and \"A\r\nSecond Letter to an Eminent Personage\" (Volume XXVII., p. 113), were the\r\nlast Thackeray ever wrote for _Punch_. The statement of his biographers\r\nthat in the year 1850, \"If we except one later flicker in 1854,\r\nThackeray's long connection with _Punch_ died out,\" is totally\r\nincorrect, for in 1851 there are forty-one literary items and a dozen\r\ncuts to his credit. But from that time until 1854 he only contributed\r\n\"The Organ Boy's Appeal\" (Volume XXV., p. 144), and thenceforward we\r\nhear no more of \"Policeman X,\" of Maloney and his Irish humour, of the\r\nFrenchman on whom, in spite of himself, he was always so severe, no more\r\nof Jeames, Jenkins, or the rest of the puppets who lived for us under\r\nhis manipulation.[40]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INKSTAND PRESENTED TO THACKERAY BY HIS EDINBURGH\r\nADMIRERS.]\r\n\r\nThe labour of producing his _Punch_ work was often irksome to him in the\r\nextreme, and many a time would he put Mark Lemon off--now, because he\r\nwas so well in the swim with his novel then in hand that he begged hard\r\nto be let off, and again, because the Muse was coy and would not on any\r\naccount be wooed. On one occasion he wrote explaining with what\r\nweariness he had been battening rhymes for three hours in his head, and\r\ncould get nothing out: \"I must beg you to excuse me,\" he ingeniously\r\nadded, \"for I've worked just as much for you as though I had done\r\nsomething.\" At other times he would break away from the company he was\r\nin, in order to complete his regulation number of columns. His godson,\r\nafterwards the Rev. Francis Thackeray, has told us how the great man\r\nonce took him to a conjuring entertainment and, having secured him a\r\ngood place, explained \"Now, I must leave you awhile, and go and make a\r\nfive-pound note.\" And in such a manner, in haste and with\r\ndisinclination, was often produced what James Hannay calls \"the\r\ninimitable, wise, easy, playful, worldly, social sketch of Thackeray.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough, as a rule, Thackeray preferred social to political satire, he\r\nwould sometimes point an epigram with sharp effect. For example, in\r\n1845, the disclosure in the \"Freeman\" of J. Young's letter, to the\r\ndiscomfiture of the Whigs and Lord Melbourne, suggested to Thackeray the\r\nline: \"Young's Night Thought--Wish I hadn't franked that letter!\" Its\r\nappearance in _Punch_ caused Mr. Sparkes to buttonhole the writer at the\r\nReform Club, and excitedly dilate on the mischief that was being done to\r\nthe Party by such very public and sarcastic means. Thackeray burst out\r\nlaughing--\"the mountain shook,\" says the historian--but felt a little\r\ngenuine pleasure at the circumstance all the same.\r\n\r\nAs success and public recognition came to him for his novels--the\r\nsuccess for which he had worked so hard--his disinclination to work for\r\n_Punch_ increased. No doubt the policy of the paper had something to do\r\nwith it; but there can be little question that the great fame and reward\r\nhe derived from novel writing made more occasional work distasteful to\r\nhim, and in 1854--the year of \"The Newcomes\"--Thackeray corrected his\r\nlast proof for _Punch_. He had foreseen it for some time, for in 1849 he\r\nhad written to Mrs. Brookfield from Paris, \"What brought me to this\r\nplace? Well, I am glad I came; it will give me a subject for at least\r\nsix weeks in _Punch_\" [\"Paris Revisited,\" &c.], \"of which I was getting\r\nso weary that I thought I must have done with it.\" Five years afterwards\r\nhe wrote to the same lady: \"What do you think I have done to-day? I have\r\nsent in my resignation to _Punch_. There appears in next _Punch_ an\r\narticle so wicked, I think, by poor ---- [? Jerrold] that upon my word\r\nI don't think I ought to pull any longer in the same boat with such a\r\nsavage little Robespierre. The appearance of this incendiary article put\r\nme in such a rage that I could only cool myself with a ride in the\r\npark.\" Writing a long while afterwards for the public eye, he said,\r\n\"Another member of _Punch's_ Cabinet, the biographer of Jeames, the\r\nauthor of the 'Snob papers,' resigned his functions on account of Mr.\r\nPunch's assaults upon the present Emperor of the French nation, whose\r\nanger he thought it was unpatriotic to arouse\"--being thus in Punchian\r\npolicy, if not in motive, in entire accord with Mr. Ruskin.\r\n\r\nA more complete and emphatic statement of the facts, as Thackeray viewed\r\nthem, will be found in the subjoined letter from the novelist to one of\r\nthe _Punch_ proprietors, which, by their courtesy, is here printed for\r\nthe first time:--\r\n\r\n                                                    \"March 24th, 1855.\r\n                                                     \"36, Onslow Sqre.\r\n\r\n  \"MY DEAR EVANS,\r\n\r\n\"I find a note of yours dated Feb. 5, in wh. F.M.E.[41] states that my\r\naccount shall be prepared directly. F.M.E. has a great deal to do and\r\npay and think of, but W. M. T. has also his engagements.\r\n\r\n\"I hope your 'Poetry of Punch' will not be published before my collected\r\nBallads--Now remember (you wrote me a letter expressly on the subject)\r\nthat the Copyright of all articles in 'Punch' were mine, by\r\nstipulation--and my book would be very much hurt by the appearance of\r\nanother containing 3/4 of its contents.\r\n\r\n\"I met Murray the publisher the other day, and cannot help fancying from\r\nhis manner to me that there is a screw loose with him too about that\r\nunlucky Leech article. Lemon, answering one of my letters, said that he\r\npersonally complained that my account of leaving 'Punch' was not\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n\"There was such a row at the time, and I was so annoyed at the wrong\r\nthat I had done, that I thought I had best leave Lemon's remonstrance\r\nfor a while and right it on some future occasion. I recall now to you\r\nand beg you to show to him and to any other persons who may have\r\nreceived a different version of the story--what the facts were. I had\r\nhad some serious public differences with the Conduct of 'Punch'--about\r\nthe abuse of Prince Albert and the Chrystal [_sic_] Palace at wh. I very\r\nnearly resigned, about abuse of Lord Palmerston, about abuse finally of\r\nL. Napoleon--in all which 'Punch' followed the 'Times,' wh. I think and\r\nthought was writing unjustly at that time, and dangerously for the\r\nwelfare and peace of the Country.\r\n\r\n\"Coming from Edinburgh I bought a 'Punch' containing the picture of a\r\nBeggar on Horseback, in wh. the Emperor was represented galloping to\r\nhell with a sword reeking with blood. As soon as ever I could after my\r\nreturn (a day or 2 days after), I went to Bouverie St., saw you and gave\r\nin my resignation.\r\n\r\n\"I mention this because I know the cause of my resignation has been\r\nquestioned at 'Punch'--because this was the cause of it. I talked it\r\nover with you in, and Leech saw me coming out of your room, and I told\r\nhim of my retirement.\r\n\r\n\"No engagement afterwards took place between us; nor have I ever been\r\nsince a member of 'Punch's' Cabinet, so to speak. Wishing you all\r\nheartily well, I wrote a few occasional papers last year--and not liking\r\nthe rate of remuneration, wh. was less than that to wh. I had been\r\naccustomed in my time, I wrote no more.\r\n\r\n\"And you can say for me as a reason why I should feel hurt at your\r\nchanging the old rates of payment made to me--that I am not a man who\r\nquarrels about a guinea or two except as a point of honour; _and_ that\r\nwhen I could have had a much larger sum than that wh. you gave me for my\r\nlast novel--I preferred to remain with old friends, who had acted\r\nhonourably and kindly by me.\r\n\r\n\"I reproach myself with having written 1/2 a line regarding my old\r\n'Punch' Companions--which was perfectly true, wh. I have often said--but\r\nwhich I ought not to have written. No other wrong that I know of have I\r\ndone. And I think it is now about time that my old friends and\r\npublishers should set me right.\r\n\r\n                       \"Yours very faithfully, dear Evans,\r\n\r\n                                            \"W.

Ward, R.A., in the Possession of Richard Hurst, Esq._)]\r\n\r\nYet, though he resigned, he would still from time to time attend the\r\nDinners, at which he was always made welcome by the publishers and his\r\nlate colleagues. When, during this period, he was pleading for\r\nassistance for the family of one of the Staff who had passed away, he\r\ntook pleasure in admitting that--\"It is through my connection with\r\n_Punch_ that I owe the good chances that have lately befallen me, and\r\nhave had so many kind offers of help in my own days of trouble that I\r\nwould thankfully aid a friend whom death has called away.\" So, although\r\nhe was no longer to be identified with the paper, Thackeray--\"the great\r\nThackeray\" he had become--was bound to it and to several members of the\r\nStaff by ties of intimate affection, and his sudden death came with\r\nstunning force upon them all. To Leech it was as his own death-knell;\r\nand when he, Mark Lemon, Shirley Brooks, Tom Taylor, Horace Mayhew,\r\n\"Jacob Omnium,\" and John Tenniel stood round his grave, they felt, I\r\nhave been told, as if the glory of _Punch_ had been irremediably dimmed.\r\nNo verses ever penned by _Punch's_ poets to the memory of one of their\r\ndead brethren ever breathed more love or more beauty of thought than\r\nthose in which Thackeray was mourned, and defended against the charge of\r\ncynicism--\" ... a brave, true, honest gentleman, whom no pen but his own\r\ncould depict as those who knew him could desire\":--\r\n\r\n  \"He was a cynic: By his life all wrought\r\n    Of generous acts, mild words, and gentle ways;\r\n  His heart wide open to all kindly thought,\r\n    His hand so quick to give, his tongue to praise.\r\n\r\n  \"And if his acts, affections, works, and ways\r\n    Stamp not upon the man the cynic's sneer,\r\n  From life to death, oh, public, turn your gaze--\r\n    The last scene of a cynical career!\r\n\r\n  \"Those uninvited crowds, this hush that lies,\r\n    Unbroken, till the solemn words of prayer\r\n  From many hundred reverent voices rise\r\n    Into the sunny stillness of the air.\r\n\r\n  \"These tears, in eyes but little used to tears,\r\n    Those sobs, from manly lips, hard set and grim,\r\n  Of friends, to whom his life lay bare for years,\r\n    Of strangers, who but knew his books, not him.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] The inclusion of the article entitled \"A Plea for Plush,\" in the\r\nvolume of \"Contributions to _Punch_\" in \"Complete Works,\" published by\r\nSmith, Elder & Co., is a mistake.

Horace Mayhew's diploma joke consisted, I believe,\r\nof \"Questions addressées au grand concours aux élèves d'Anglais, du\r\nCollége St. Badaud dans le Département de la Haute Cockaigne\" (Vol. III.\r\np. 89). Regular occupation was forthwith found for him as sub-editor,\r\nhis duties being to collect the cuts from the artists, to act as medium\r\nof communication between the writers and draughtsmen, and to assist Mark\r\nLemon in making-up the paper; and for these services he received one\r\npound a week. Soon, however, it was found that the editor could very\r\nwell perform all such duties for himself, and the post of \"pony\" was\r\nabolished. Horace--or \"Ponny,\" as he was invariably nicknamed--became\r\none of the accepted writers. He was most prolific as a suggestor, and\r\nnever failed of point and pith in his own numerous little paragraphs. As\r\na proposer he had much of the talent of his brother, but little of his\r\ngenius. \"The Life and Adventures of Miss Robinson Crusoe,\" written by\r\nDouglas Jerrold, was \"Ponny's\" suggestion; but he carried out his\r\nconceptions entirely in such papers as his extremely amusing \"Model\r\nMen,\" \"Model Women,\" and \"Model Couples;\" and his \"Change for a\r\nShilling\" and \"Letters left at a Pastrycook's\" are still remembered.\r\n\r\n\"Ponny\" had not a seat \"in the Cabinet\" until January 11th, 1845, before\r\nwhich time he had no separate existence as a contributor, all his \"copy\"\r\nbeing entered indiscriminately to the Editor. For a long while his\r\naverage contribution was thirty-one columns in each volume; but his main\r\nvalue lay in the short articles and paragraphs of a playful and\r\nwhimsical character. Thus, when the \"Birmingham Advertiser\" declared\r\nwith grovelling snobbishness that \"in these days it is quite refreshing\r\nto pronounce the name of the Duke of Newcastle,\" \"Ponny\" suggested that\r\nduring the summer months \"the name of his Grace should be written up in\r\nevery public thoroughfare.\" He was, in fact, in the words of an old\r\nfriend, \"bright, good-natured, and lively, not very clever, but always\r\nletting off little jokes;\" \"a social butterfly,\" adds Mr. Sala, \"who\r\nnever fulfilled the promise of his youth.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a strikingly good-looking man, and was justifiably proud of\r\nThackeray's greeting as they met at Evans's--\"Ah, here comes Colonel\r\nNewcome!\" \"From his aristocratic mien and premature baldness,\" says\r\nVizetelly, \"Wiltshire Austin christened him 'the wicked old Marquis.'\r\nThe keeping of late hours was Ponny Mayhew's bane. For a quarter of a\r\ncentury--save an annual fortnight devoted to recruiting himself at\r\nScarborough or elsewhere--he scorned to seek repose before the milkman\r\nstarted on his rounds, and during the greater portion of the year never\r\nthought of rising until the sun had set, when he would emerge from his\r\nBond Street rooms as spruce and gay as a lark.\" He had been engaged to a\r\ndaughter of Douglas Jerrold (whose other daughter, it will be\r\nremembered, was the wife of Henry Mayhew), but on the ground that \"one\r\nMayhew is enough in the family,\" Jerrold would not hear of it, and the\r\nyoung people remained faithful to each other to the end. Living first\r\nwith Joseph Swain, the engraver, he afterwards took up his residence for\r\na time with the Lemons at King's Road, Chelsea.\r\n\r\n\"Ponny's\" portrait, it has often been said, may be seen in the White\r\nKnight in \"Alice in Wonderland;\" but \"the resemblance,\" says Sir John\r\nTenniel, \"was purely accidental, a mere unintentional caricature, which\r\nhis _friends_, of course, were only too delighted to make the most of.\r\nP. M. was certainly handsome, whereas the White Knight can scarcely be\r\nconsidered a type of 'manly beauty.'\" He was a great favourite with the\r\nStaff, by reason of his many charming qualities. What they thought of\r\nhim may be in a measure deduced from one or two of the verses borrowed\r\nfrom Shirley Brooks's Birthday Ode, here reproduced from Mr. Hatton's\r\n\"True Story\" in \"London Society\":--\r\n\r\n  \"Is he perfect? Why, no, that is hardly the case;\r\n  If he were, the _Punch_ Table would not be his place;\r\n  You all have your faults--I confess one or two--\r\n  And we love him the better for having a few.\r\n\r\n  \"He never did murder, like--never mind whom,\r\n  Nor poisoned relations, like--some in this room;\r\n  Nor deceived the young ladies, like--men whom I see,\r\n  Nor even intrigued with a gosling, like--me.\r\n\r\n  \"No; black are our bosoms, and red are our hands,\r\n  But a model of virtue our Ponniboy stands;\r\n  And his basest detractors can only say this,\r\n  That he's fond of the cup, and the card, and the kiss.\r\n\r\n  \"A warm-hearted fellow--a faithful ally,\r\n  Our Bloater's[42] Vice-Regent o'er _Punch's_ gone by;\r\n  He's as true to the flag of the White Friars still\r\n  As when he did service with Jerrold and Gil.\r\n\r\n  \"Here's his health in a bumper! \"_Old_\" Ponny--a fib;\r\n  What's fifty? A baby. Bring tucker and bib.\r\n  Add twenty; then ask us again, little boy,\r\n  And till then may your life be all pleasure and joy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ponny\" Mayhew, who did not actually write anything for some years\r\nbefore his end, died in May, 1872; and on p. 191 of the sixty-second\r\nvolume a graceful obituary notice pays tribute to his long and faithful\r\nservice and his gentle good-nature.\r\n\r\nBy this time _Punch's_ established reputation brought a great number of\r\nanonymous contributions, only a very few of which were ever used, and of\r\nfewer still was the authorship placed upon record. Early in 1843,\r\nhowever (p. 82, Vol. IV.), Mr. Blackwood, of Edinburgh, sent in one of\r\nthe earliest of Scottish witticisms, a conundrum; Joseph O'Leary, a\r\nreporter of the \"Morning Herald,\" is said to have contributed a poem on\r\n\"The English Vandal;\" and R. B. Peake, who had adapted \"A Night with\r\n_Punch_\" for W. J. Hammond, began his little series of \"_Punch's_\r\nProvincial Intelligence,\" of which the most notable is a humorous report\r\nof the University Boatrace of the year; and then the elder Hood began\r\nhis short but brilliant career.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS HOOD\r\n_From an Engraving by W. Hole, after the Painting by Lewis._]\r\n\r\nThomas Hood had forgiven and forgotten the annoyance he had felt on\r\nseeing in the first number of _Punch_ a bogus advertisement ascribed to\r\nhim under the title of \"Lessons in Punmanship,\" at which he \"could only\r\nexpress his amazement that his name should be paraded with apparent\r\nauthority in a paper of the very existence of which he was not aware;\"\r\nand within two years he became a fairly constant contributor, after\r\nwriting to Dickens, \"You will be glad to hear that I have made an\r\narrangement with Bradbury to contribute to _Punch_, but that is a secret\r\nI cannot keep from you. It will be light occasional work for odd times.\"\r\nSo he began with a sketch re-drawn by H. G. Hine, accompanying a \"Police\r\nReport of a Daring Robbery by a Noble Lord\"--the first of his stinging\r\nattacks on Lord William Lennox, one of _Punch's_ favourite and, it must\r\nbe admitted, legitimate butts. Then followed at different times a score\r\nor more of conundrums in the true Hoodian vein under the title of \"Whys\r\nand Whens,\" fair specimens of which are these: \"Why is killing bees\r\nlike a confession? Because you unbuzz 'em.\" \"Why is 'yes' the most\r\nignorant word in the language? Because it doesn't no anything.\" \"What's\r\nthe difference between a soldier and a bomb-shell? One goes to wars, the\r\nother goes to peaces.\" \"When is a clock on the stairs dangerous? When it\r\nruns down.\" A couple of sketches and \"A Drop of Gin,\" an important poem\r\nof seventy-six lines somewhat in the manner of the latter portion of\r\n\"Miss Kilmansegg\" were followed--enclosed within a comic border!--by his\r\ngreatest popular effort, \"The Song of the Shirt.\" This appeared, not in\r\nthe \"Almanac,\" but in the \"Christmas Number,\" on p. 261 of the second\r\nvolume for 1843.\r\n\r\nThe particular incident by which this immortal poem was suggested was\r\none which had called forth a powerful leading-article in the \"Times.\" It\r\nwas the \"terrible fact\" that a woman named Bidell, with a squalid,\r\nhalf-starved infant at the breast, was \"charged at the Lambeth\r\npolice-court with pawning her master's goods, for which she had to give\r\n£2 security. Her husband had died by an accident, and had left her with\r\ntwo children to support, and she obtained by her needle for the\r\nmaintenance of herself and family what her master called the 'good\r\nliving' of _seven shillings a week_.\"\r\n\r\n_Punch_ was at once aglow with red-hot indignation, and in an article\r\nentitled \"Famine and Fashion!\" proposed an advertisement such as this\r\nfor the firm that employed her--\r\n\r\n  \"_Holland coats_ from two-and-three are shown\r\n  By Hunger's haggard fingers neatly sewn.\r\n  _Embroidered tunics_ for your infant made,--\r\n  The eyes are sightless now that worked the braid;\r\n  _Rich vests of velvet_ at this mart appear,\r\n  Each one bedimm'd by some poor widow's tear;\r\n  And _riding habits_ formed for maid or wife,\r\n  All cheap--aye, ladies, cheap as pauper-life.\r\n  For _mourning suits_ this is the fitting mart,\r\n  For every garment help'd to break a heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject touched Hood more powerfully perhaps than others, for his\r\nnature was essentially grave and sympathetic. As he himself had said,\r\nit was only for his livelihood that he was a lively Hood--although he\r\nwas always brimming over with comicalities; and he never felt more\r\ndeeply the dignity of his profession and his own force and weight than\r\nwhen he was engaged on serious work. So Hood conjured up his \"Song of\r\nthe Shirt,\" moved by the revelations of poor seamstresses who received,\r\nas it appeared, five farthings a shirt, out of which sum they had to\r\nfind their own needles! Mark Lemon told Mr. Joseph Hatton that Hood had\r\n\"accompanied the poem with a few lines in which he expressed the fear\r\nthat it was hardly suitable for _Punch_, and leaving it between his\r\ndiscretion and the waste-paper basket.\" It had, said Hood, already been\r\nrejected by three papers, and he was sick of the sight of it. Mark Lemon\r\nbrought the poem up at the Table, where the majority of the Staff\r\nprotested against its inclusion in a comic paper. But Lemon was\r\ndetermined; and, after all, was it not for a Christmas number that he\r\ndestined it--a number in which something serious, pathetic, with a note\r\nof pity and love, was surely not out of place?\r\n\r\nThe effect on its publication was tremendous. The poem went through the\r\nland like wild-fire. Nearly every paper quoted it, headed by the\r\n\"Times;\" it was the talk of the hour, the talk of the country. It went\r\nstraight to John Bull's kind, _bourgeois_, sympathetic heart, just as\r\nCarlyle declared that Ruskin's truths had \"pierced like arrows\" into\r\nhis. The authorship, too, was vigorously canvassed with intense\r\ninterest. Dickens, with that keen insight and critical faculty which had\r\nenabled him almost alone among literary experts to detect the sex of\r\nGeorge Eliot, then an unknown writer (though doubtless he was helped in\r\nthe case I now speak of by Hood's letter to him just quoted), was one of\r\nthe few who at once named the writer of the verses. And it was well for\r\nHood that he had proof positive of the authorship, for one of the most\r\ncurious things connected with the poem was the number of persons who had\r\nthe incomprehensible audacity to claim it. One young gentleman was\r\nmentioned by name, either by his friends or himself, and I find a letter\r\nin a volume of newspaper cuttings to this effect: \"I have just read, to\r\nmy great surprise, the announcement in your paper that Mr. Hood wrote\r\n'The Song of the Shirt,' because _I know positively_ that what I before\r\nstated to you is the fact.\" So hard pressed, indeed, was Hood, that he\r\nwrote a private letter in February, 1845, in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n     \"As I have publicly acknowledged the authorship of the '_Song of\r\n     the Shirt_,' I can have no objection to satisfy you privately on\r\n     the subject. My old friends Bradbury and Evans, the proprietors of\r\n     _Punch_, could show you the document conclusive on the subject. But\r\n     I trust my authority will be sufficient, especially as it comes\r\n     from _a man on his death-bed_.\"\r\n\r\nHad these literary vultures had their way, Hood would have been brazened\r\nout of his verses altogether.\r\n\r\n_Punch_ shared handsomely in the glory of the poet, and its circulation\r\n_tripled_ on the strength of it. And Mrs. Hood, poor soul, triumphed in\r\nher prophecy; for had she not said, and maintained in spite of each\r\nsuccessive rejection from foolish editors--\"Now mind, Hood, mark my\r\nwords; this will tell wonderfully! It is one of the best things you ever\r\ndid!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so this song, which, in spite of its defects, still thrills you as\r\nyou read, achieved such a popularity that for sudden and enthusiastic\r\napplause its reception has rarely been equalled. It was soon translated\r\ninto every language of Europe--(Hood used to laugh as he wondered\r\nhow they would render \"Seam and gusset and band,\" into Dutch);\r\nit was printed and sold as catchpennies, printed on cotton\r\npocket-handkerchiefs, it was illustrated and parodied in a thousand\r\nways; and the greatest triumph of all, which brought tears of joy to\r\nHood's eyes, before a week was out a poor beggar-woman came singing it\r\ndown the street, the words set to a simple air of her own. The greatest\r\ndelight of Hood--\"the darling of the English heart,\" as he was called,\r\nwho was literally dying when he wrote the song, and so fulfilled the\r\nsole condition which Jerrold said was all that was needed to make him\r\nfamous--was the conviction that the interest which the nation was taking\r\nin his lines would turn to the real advantage of those in whose cause he\r\npleaded. He felt that he had touched not only the nation's heart but\r\nthe nation's conscience, and he deeply appreciated Kenny Meadows' and\r\nLeech's efforts in the same direction, such as are to be seen in the\r\ncartoons of \"Pin Money, Needle Money,\" and many more besides.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the \"Song of the Shirt,\" which brought letters to _Punch_\r\nfrom every part of the globe, Mr. Ruskin declares it the most impressive\r\nexample of the most perfect manifestation of the temper of the\r\ncaricaturist, the highest development of which is to be found in Hood's\r\npoetry; and he compares it to Leech's \"General Février turned Traitor.\"\r\nThere certainly can be no doubt that its force is amazingly assisted by\r\nits plainness and simplicity of language.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that one verse of the poem was not printed by Mark\r\nLemon, although it appeared in the original manuscript; nor is it\r\nincluded in the reprinted \"Works.\" I imagine that its omission was\r\nsimply a matter of make-up, as it would be hard to compress the poem\r\ninto the space allotted to it, without using a much smaller type than\r\nwas usual in _Punch_; and an odd number of verses is a serious matter\r\nfor a sub-editor to wrestle with when he has to arrange a poem into\r\ndouble columns of a given depth. The missing verse, which, to do Mark\r\nLemon justice, is the one most easily spared, runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"Seam, and gusset, and band,\r\n  Band, and gusset, and seam,\r\n          Work, work, work,\r\n  Like an Engine that works by Steam!\r\n  A mere machine of iron and wood,\r\n    That toils for Mammon's sake,\r\n  Without a brain to ponder and craze,\r\n    Or a heart to feel--and break!\"\r\n\r\nIn the same number that contained the \"Song of the Shirt\" was another\r\nimpressive poem by Hood, \"The Pauper's Christmas Carol,\" in seven\r\nstanzas; but it was entirely overshadowed and eclipsed by its\r\nfellow-song, so that it lay, as it has done for the most part since,\r\nalmost unknown, unhonoured, and unsung. Yet it was as ringing and true\r\nas any of Jerrold's most stirring efforts in his championship of the\r\npoor. But the two friends were essentially different in their treatment\r\nand methods. Hood's satire was never personal, as Jerrold's was; and,\r\nunlike Jerrold, Hood would never tolerate the idea, much less practise\r\nit, of placing \"a wide moral gulf between Rich and Poor, with Hate on\r\none side and Fear on the other.\" He sought to help the poor by awakening\r\nthe love and sympathy of Society, and for that reason he selected his\r\nepitaph in reference to his poem, for he would never have chosen this as\r\ntechnically his finest work. He was altogether out of harmony with\r\nJerrold's policy of stinging the rich into charity and justice by biting\r\nsatire and illogical sarcasm, warm-hearted and well-meant though it was.\r\n\r\nAt this time Hood was fast approaching his end; and he wrote for _Punch_\r\non his death-bed. Though still young, he was becoming more and more\r\nafflicted with physical ailments. Amongst other troubles, he was getting\r\nstone deaf, he said; but consoled himself with the reflection that his\r\nfriend Charles Landseer was _two stone deafer_. And all the while his\r\nrollicking fun, and quaintly sudden turn of word and idea were\r\ntransporting his readers, as he somewhere says, \"from Dull-age to\r\nGrin-age.\" His humour was effervescent, continuous, and effortless--not\r\nlike Jerrold's wit, intermittent flashes called up at need--but\r\noverflowing in a rich stream of joke, pun, hit, crank, and quip,\r\ncovering a field far wider than Jerrold's, and more genial.\r\n\r\nThe next contribution was his poem \"The Drama,\" apropos of the State\r\ntrials in Ireland, and the Fair Maid of Perth, with allusion to the\r\nFighting Smith in either case--a poem of 108 lines. Then followed\r\n\"Reflections on New Year's Day\" (January 6th, 1844), from which a couple\r\nof specimen verses may well be quoted:--\r\n\r\n  \"Yes, yes, it's very true and very clear!\r\n    By way of compliment and common chat,\r\n  It's very well to wish me a New Year;\r\n    But wish me a New Hat.\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, yes, 'tis very pleasant, though I'm poor,\r\n    To hear the steeple make that merry din;\r\n  Except I wish one bell were at the door\r\n    To ring new trowsers in.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a column on \"The Awful State of Ireland\" Hood was, on the 3rd of\r\nMarch, 1844, editorially reckoned on the Staff. But the decree of Fate\r\nwas against him, and he only contributed two more pieces altogether.\r\n_Punch_, as he acknowledged, was the one bright meteor that had flashed\r\nacross his milk-and-watery way in his latter years, and gave him,\r\ntogether with Sir Robert Peel's tactful and charming bestowal of a\r\npension, his last delight. But already death, he said, had thrown open\r\nwide its door to him, and he was \"so near to it that he could almost\r\nhear the hinges creak.\" And when he died, there were engraved upon his\r\ntombstone, at his own desire, the simple words, \"He Sang the Song of the\r\nShirt.\"\r\n\r\nThe first arrival of 1844 was Dr. Edward Vaughan Kenealy, who, many\r\nyears after, acted for and defended the historic \"Claimant,\" the\r\nself-confessed Orton, _alias_ Castro, _alias_ \"Sir Roger Tichborne,\"\r\nwith so much violent ability, lost his balance and came to utter grief.\r\nIn his youth one of his scholarly relaxations was to translate English\r\nverse of various sorts into various languages--Greek, Hebrew, Arabic,\r\nHindustani, and the like, for he was a remarkable linguist. His unique\r\n_Punch_ contribution was the rendering of \"The King of the Cannibal\r\nIslands\" into Greek, and very good Greek too. The _jeu d'esprit_ is to\r\nbe found on p. 79, Volume VI., as well as in his volume of verse\r\ndedicated to Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, whom he was destined\r\nafterwards to waste his life in vilifying, while shattering his own\r\ncareer in his savage and ineffective assaults.\r\n\r\nIn the following month T. J. Serle struck up an ephemeral connection. He\r\nhad been Macready's secretary, and acting manager of Drury Lane, and had\r\nwritten \"The Shadow on the Wall,\" and other successful plays; and\r\nJerrold's eldest son was named Thomas Serle, after him. His first paper\r\nwas \"A Fine Lady,\" on the 10th of March; but after one further\r\ncontribution, two months later, he appeared no more. About the same time\r\nthere was printed \"The Magnitia,\" by Frank Moir (May 3rd, No. 199).\r\n\r\nJ. W. Ferguson was a far more important and more useful contributor,\r\nwhose work was full of talent, whose versification was clever and\r\npointed, and whose topical \"_Punch's_ Fairy Tales\" (with obtrusively\r\nobvious morals) are models of their kind. His \"Little Frenchman's First\r\nLesson\" (May 18th, 1844) purports to be a translation of a French poem\r\nwith which patriots are supposed to implant hatred of England in the\r\nminds and hearts of their children the refrain being \"Car ce sont là des\r\nperfides Albionnais!\"--and the \"Second Lesson,\" which replies to a\r\nFrench attack, were important efforts. His \"Lays of the Amphitheatre\r\n(Royal), by T. B. Macaulay,\" \"Cyinon and Iphigeneia,\" and similar\r\ncontributions justified his inclusion in the Staff (April, 1845); but\r\nafter the autumn of 1846, by which time he was represented by a score of\r\ncolumns, he disappeared from _Punch's_ scene.\r\n\r\nA letter from Charles Lever (6th June, 1844), under the title of \"A\r\nFamiliar Epistle,\" and over the signature \"Archy Delany,\" for a moment\r\nbrought that distinguished novelist into contact with Thackeray--a\r\ncircumstance that was not forgotten by either writer, when the latter\r\npaid his rather stiff Dublin visit some time afterwards to the \"Harry\r\nRollicker\" whom he so brilliantly parodied in his \"Prize Novelists.\"\r\nThen Mr. W. P. Bull, of Nuneaton, sent in half a column of mock-heroic\r\nverse--\"A Soliloquy\"--which purported to be the commencement of a scene\r\nfrom an unpublished drama entitled \"The Chemist,\" a contribution of\r\nwhich Lemon thought very highly. No further items, however, came from\r\nthat quarter.\r\n\r\nThree recruits appeared with the month of October. A writer named\r\nJackson forwarded a couple of pieces (\"Irish Intelligence\" and \"The\r\nPolka Pest\"--the latter well describing the craze with which the new\r\ndance inoculated the whole country); and then Laman Blanchard, Jerrold's\r\nlife-long friend and fellow-worker from the beginning, made a début\r\nthat was almost coincident with his death. His \"Royal Civic Function\"\r\nshowed what a hand had been lost to _Punch_; but it was his delightful\r\n\"New Year's Ode: To the Winner of the St. Nisbett--Season, 1844,\" that\r\nwas the best of his rare contributions. It was at once an elegy of Mrs.\r\nNisbett, and a prayer and prophecy that she might again be seen on the\r\nboards. The last verse runs:--\r\n\r\n  \"Who weds a mere beauty, dooms dozens to grieve;\r\n    Who marries an heiress, leaves hundreds undone;\r\n  Who bears off an actress (she never took leave),\r\n    Deprives a whole city of rational fun.\r\n  But farewell the glances and nods of St. Nisbett;\r\n    We list for her short ringing laughter in vain,\r\n  And yet--bereaved London!--What think you of _this_ bet?\r\n    A hundred to one we shall see her again!\"\r\n\r\nThe prophecy was only partly fulfilled; Mrs. Nisbett was certainly seen\r\nagain upon the stage, but Blanchard was not there to enjoy the sight. He\r\ndied within the same year, to the passionate grief of Douglas Jerrold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOM TAYLOR.\r\n(_From a Photograph by Bassano._)]\r\n\r\nThe last and most important accession of the year was Tom Taylor, for\r\nsix-and-thirty years a Staff officer of _Punch_, and for the last six of\r\nthem commander-in-chief. He was twenty-seven years old when he sent in\r\nhis first two contributions--\"_Punch_ to Messieurs les Rédacteurs of the\r\nFrench Press\" and \"Startling and most Important Intelligence\" (October\r\n19th, 1844). According to John Timbs, \"Landells in one of his artistic\r\nvisits to Cambridge met with Mr. T. Taylor, who, having completed his\r\nUniversity studies, came to London to embark in the profession of\r\nletters, his first contribution being to Douglas Jerrold's 'Illuminated\r\nMagazine,'\" just at the time when Landells ceased his connection.\r\nBristed, in his record of English University life, foretold of\r\n\"Travis,\" generally accepted as a literary portrait of Taylor, \"perhaps\r\nhe will be a nominal barrister and an actual writer for _Punch_ and the\r\nmagazines. Perhaps he will go quite mad and write a tragedy:\" a capital\r\nexample of a prophecy after the event, so far as it goes--for \"Five\r\nYears\" was published in 1851.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN LEECH, TOM TAYLOR, AND PART OF HORACE MAYHEW.\r\n(_Drawn by R. Doyle._)]\r\n\r\nTom Taylor prided himself on the classic verve of his prose and verse,\r\nand undoubtedly assisted in maintaining _Punch's_ literary standard. His\r\nwork for the paper went on increasing--from six columns in Vol. VII., to\r\nforty-two in Vol. XIII.--and soon won him his seat at the Table. For a\r\nlong while, however, he did not shine as a cartoon-suggestor, the first\r\nbeing \"Peel's Farewell\" (July 14th, 1849), and the second in the\r\nfollowing May, the extremely happy burlesque on the picture in the\r\nNational Gallery--\"Leeds Mercury instructing Young England.\" As time\r\nwent on and he became known as a writer of taste and versatility, as a\r\ndramatist and adaptor of plays, French and English; art critic of the\r\n\"Times;\" artist biographer; and Civil Servant (he attained to the\r\nsecretaryship of the Local Government Board), the weight of his\r\nincreasing responsibility and influence seemed to get into what should\r\nhave been his humorous work. To counteract it, Thackeray, up to the time\r\nof his resignation, struggled to maintain the spirit of jollity and the\r\nlightness of touch which had formerly been _Punch's_ true note. But in\r\n1874, when Shirley Brooks died, Tom Taylor, who had been identified with\r\nthe paper ten years before Brooks had joined it, was promoted, as by\r\nright of service, to the supreme command.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that his editorship was a success. His fun was too\r\nscholarly and well-ordered, too veiled, deliberate, and ponderous; and\r\nunder him _Punch_ touched its lowest point of popularity.\r\n\r\n  \"In humour slow, though sharp and keen his mind;\r\n  His hand was heavy, though his heart was kind.\"\r\n\r\nHis popularity among the outsiders was great, as I have learnt from many\r\nof his old contributors; for he loved to extend his hospitality to young\r\nmen at his house, Lavender Sweep, at Wandsworth, and to send kindly\r\nnotes of encouragement and promises of future help. Nevertheless, he was\r\never the butt of rival publications. In one of them a cartoon, entitled\r\n\"An Editor Abroad,\" was published, showing Mr. Burnand and Mr. du\r\nMaurier helping him and his _Punch_ Show out of the mud in which he had\r\nstuck; in another he was represented as \"The Trumpet Blower;\" while in\r\nan article in \"The Mask\" (April, 1868), before he had assumed his sway,\r\nMr. Punch is supposed to point to \"Mark Lemon's Triumphal Car\" and,\r\nreferring to Taylor, to say: \"He is our seraph.... His adaptations, I\r\nassure you, are delightful. You must be well up in Michel Levy's\r\n_répertoire_ to find him out. He is so very artful.\"\r\n\r\nA peculiar feature of Tom Taylor's editorship was the hieroglyphical\r\ncharacter of his handwriting. His missives of instructions to artists\r\nand writers came as a terror to the receivers, who could make little of\r\nthem. \"Mr. Tom Taylor's letters,\" Mr. Swain informs me, \"were often very\r\ndifficult to decipher. His writing was peculiar, and he would also\r\ncontinue the letter if necessary in any odd corner that was vacant. I\r\nremember his writing some instructions to an artist one day in this\r\nfashion, while I stood at his table, and, while blotting it, saying,\r\n'You can send it off, but I don't think he'll be able to make it out.'\"\r\nTo this experience may be added my own--that I have been the first to\r\ndecipher one of these notes addressed to an unattached artist, now\r\nunderstood for the first time, nearly twenty years after it was written.\r\nTo the compositors he was a perpetual tribulation; and it is doubtful\r\nif he could not have given points to Horace Greeley. That his son helped\r\nhim, towards the end, in a secretarial sort of way, was no doubt a\r\nsaving mercy.\r\n\r\nHis was one of the busiest literary and journalistic careers of the day;\r\nand when he died he left a void--great, it is true, yet in one respect\r\neasily enough filled. But it was little to his friends that his humour\r\nwas not of the brightest and lightest, for his heart was of the warmest,\r\nas Mr. George Meredith set forth in the October number of the \"Cornhill\r\nMagazine,\" to which he contributed a noble tribute--\"To a Friend\r\nRecently Lost, T. T.\"--a sonnet beginning:--\r\n\r\n  \"When I remember, Friend, whom lost I call\r\n  Because a man beloved is taken hence,\r\n  The tender humour and the fire of sense\r\n  In your good eyes: how full of heart for all;\r\n  And chiefly for the weaker by the wall,\r\n  You bore that light of sane benevolence:\"\r\n\r\nThe _Punch_ men, themselves, in a whole-page obituary (July 24th, 1880),\r\nbore graceful testimony to his personal worth. \"That he is not with us,\"\r\nthey said, \"is hard to imagine.... A cultivated man of letters, an\r\nadmirable scholar, he was as free from pedantry as he was incapable of\r\nidleness. From first to last he was, in the highest and best sense,\r\n'Thorough.' ... Quick to detect and appreciate talent, he was ready in\r\nevery way and on all occasions to hold out a helping hand to a\r\nbeginner.\" Thus feelingly they spoke of \"the dear friend\" they had lost.\r\nFor in his death they forgot the little annoyances they had suffered\r\nfrom the tampering with their lines and spoiling their points, of which\r\nthey had sometimes had occasion to complain; with other drawbacks\r\nbelonging to an essentially fidgety nature. It may safely be said, that\r\nif he left a hard task to his successor to work up the reputation of\r\n_Punch_ as a comic paper, he did not at least render it difficult for\r\nhim to make his mark by comparison.\r\n\r\nNo new humorist appeared in the volumes for 1845, although a poet of\r\neminence found expression on a single occasion. To one Kelly is to be\r\ncredited some humorous verses on \"Dunsinane;\" to J. Rigby, an Irish\r\nSong; to Leech, his Harlequinade verses (which do not aspire even to the\r\ndignity of a \"trifle\" or doggerel); to Watts Phillips, a few articles of\r\nlittle importance; and to J. King, the verses in which an \"Exiled\r\nLondoner\" (p. 147, Vol. IX.) apostrophises his beloved Babylon. The one\r\ncontribution of importance was that of Mr. Coventry Patmore.\r\n\r\nThis was written in hot indignation of generous youth (he was but\r\ntwenty-two years old) at the French atrocity in Algiers, when, during\r\nthe campaign, General Pelissier filled with straw the mouth of the caves\r\nof Dahra, wherein the opposing Arabs, with their women and children, had\r\ntaken refuge, and set fire to the mass. This foul act of the future Duke\r\nof Malakoff caused a thrill of horror to pass through Europe, and the\r\ngentle author of \"The Angel in the House\" was moved by the scandal to\r\nthe composition of his eight-stanza poem, of which Douglas Jerrold\r\nprocured the insertion on the 16th of August (p. 73, Vol. IX.):--\r\n\r\n  \"Rush the sparks in rapid fountains\r\n    Up abroad into the sky!\r\n  From the bases of the mountains\r\n    Leap the fork'd flames mountain-high!\r\n  The flames, like devils thirsting,\r\n    Lick the wind, where crackling spars\r\n  Wage hellish warfare, worsting\r\n    All the still, astonished stars!\r\n  Ply the furnace, fling the faggots!\r\n    Lo, the flames writhe, rush, and tear\r\n  And a thousand writhe like maggots\r\n    In among them--_Vive la guerre!_\"\r\n\r\nThe poem follows the details of the massacre, sickening but for the\r\npower the lines display. It continues:\r\n\r\n  \"And now, to crown our glory,\r\n    Get we trophies, to display\r\n  As vouchers for our story,\r\n    And mementoes of this day!\r\n  Once more, then, to the grottoes!\r\n    Gather each one all he can--\r\n  Blister'd blade with Arab mottoes,\r\n    Spear-head, bloody yataghan.\r\n  Give room now to the raven\r\n    And the dog, who scent rich fare;\r\n  And let these words be graven\r\n    On the rock-side--_Vive la guerre!_\"\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Patmore's sole contribution, his Muse never again being\r\nstartled into any other poetical demonstration of the sort in _Punch's_\r\npages. The following year he became assistant-librarian at the British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n\"Jacob Omnium's\" first appearance, curiously enough, was with a short\r\narticle which, in the reprinted works of Thackeray, has been ascribed to\r\nthe novelist. This was \"A Plea for Plush\" (July 20th, 1846),\r\nappropriately signed \"[Greek: Philophlynkês],\" dealing, it is true, with\r\nJeames's nether garments on a hot day, but still with no internal\r\nevidence of style to warrant its ascription to the \"Fat Contributor.\"\r\nHenceforward his other few papers were entered to him in his own name of\r\nMatthew J. Higgins. He was a great friend of the _Punch_ Staff,\r\nparticularly of Thackeray and Leech. Of him the former had written in\r\nthe \"Ballad of Policeman X\"--\r\n\r\n  \"His name is Jacob Homnium, Exquire;\r\n    And if _I_'d committed crimes,\r\n  Good Lord! I wouldn't ave that mann\r\n    Attack me in the _Times_!----\"\r\n\r\nwhile Leech took his part against Lord John Russell on the occasion of\r\nHiggins's \"Story of the Mhow Court Martial.\" He was shown as a tall,\r\nself-possessed gentleman, saying to the little fellow, who is sparring\r\nup to him--\"Pooh, go and hit one of your own size.\" Higgins's height,\r\nindeed, was greater than that of either Thackeray or his friend Dean\r\nHole--six feet eight; and when the three friends walked abroad, the\r\nsensation among the passers-by was considerable. On Thackeray and Dean\r\nHole measuring heights once in the house of a common friend, it was\r\nfound that they were practically equal. \"Ah, yes,\" exclaimed the Dean;\r\n\"the cases are about the same, but one contains a poor dancing-master's\r\nfiddle, and the other a Stradivarius.\"\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ sensation of the year was the fierce revenge taken by Tennyson\r\nin its pages on Bulwer Lytton. Bulwer, as is explained elsewhere, had\r\nbeen set up by _Punch_ as one of its pet butts from the very beginning;\r\nand when Tennyson's sledge-hammer onslaught was brought to them, so it\r\nis said, by a distinguished man of letters--a particular friend of both\r\nparties--they rejoiced exceedingly. Tennyson's broadside had not been\r\nunprovoked. Years before, in 1830, he had published, through Effingham\r\nWilson, \"Poems, chiefly Lyrical,\" which contained the poem \"To a Darling\r\nRoom,\" afterwards suppressed. Seizing on this, Lytton had re-echoed in\r\nhis \"New Timon: A Romance of London,\" the strictures which Christopher\r\nNorth has so severely, though good-naturedly, passed upon it in\r\n\"Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine\" for May, 1832, and furthermore taunted\r\nthe Laureate with the pension of £200 which had just been conferred upon\r\nhim. The attack was just the sort to extort a violent reply.\r\n\r\n  \"Not mine, not mine (O, muse forbid!) the boon\r\n  Of borrowed notes, the mock-bird's modish tune,\r\n  The jingling medley of purloined conceits\r\n  Out-babying Wordsworth, and out-glittering Keats,\r\n  Where all the airs of patchwork pastoral chime\r\n  To drown the ears in Tennysonian rhyme.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Let school-miss Alfred vent her chaste delight\r\n  On darling rooms, so warm and bright;[43]\r\n  Chant 'I am weary' in infectious strain,\r\n  And 'catch the blue-fly singing on the pane;'\r\n  Though praised by critics and adored by Blues,\r\n  Though Peel with pudding plumb the puling muse;\r\n  Though Theban taste the Saxon purse controls,\r\n  And pensions Tennyson while starves a Knowles.\"\r\n\r\n_Punch_ (p. 64, Vol. X.) had rushed in to the rescue with the clever\r\nretort:--\r\n\r\n_\"The New Timon\" and Alfred Tennyson's Pension._\r\n\r\n  \"You've seen a lordly mastiff's port,\r\n  Bearing in calm, contemptuous sort\r\n  The snarls of some o'erpetted pup\r\n  Who grudges him his 'bit and sup:'\r\n  So stands the bard of Locksley Hall,\r\n  While puny darts around him fall,\r\n  Tipp'd with what TIMON takes for venom;\r\n  He is the mastiff, TIM the Blenheim.\"\r\n\r\nBut Tennyson's was not by any means \"the lordly mastiff's port.\" He was\r\nstung by the contemptuous reference to the pension, and proved the truth\r\nof Johnson's aphorism--\r\n\r\n  \"Of all the griefs that harass the distrest,\r\n  Sure the most bitter is the scornful jest\"--\r\n\r\nand he straightway wrote the ten verses that appeared under the title of\r\n\"The New Timon, and the Poets\" (p. 103, Vol. X.), signing them\r\n\"ALCIBIADES\":--\r\n\r\n  \"We know him, out of SHAKESPEARE'S art,\r\n  And those fine curses which he spoke;\r\n  The old TIMON, with his noble heart,\r\n  That, strongly loathing, greatly broke.\r\n  So died the Old: here comes the New.\r\n  Regard him: a familiar face:\r\n  I _thought_ we knew him: What, it's you,\r\n  The padded man that wears the stays--\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"What profits now to understand\r\n  The merits of a spotless shirt--\r\n  A dapper boot--a little hand--\r\n  If half the little soul is dirt?\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"A TIMON, you! Nay, nay, for shame:\r\n  It looks too arrogant a jest--\r\n  The fierce old man--to take _his_ name,\r\n  You bandbox. Off, and let him rest.\"\r\n\r\nThis crushing rejoinder was cordially welcomed by Thackeray and the\r\nrest of the Staff, who loved to castigate the fopperies of the conceited\r\npoetaster, and Lytton, it is said, was not a little astonished at the\r\nvirility of \"school-miss Alfred.\" But Tennyson's anger soon cooled;\r\nperhaps his conscience smote him; for the very next week he toned down\r\nthe savagery of his first verses in an \"Afterthought,\" in which he said:\r\n\r\n  \"And _I_ too talk, and lose the touch\r\n    I talk of. Surely, after all,\r\n  The noblest answer unto such\r\n    Is kindly silence when they brawl.\"\r\n\r\nThe first set of verses are not to be found in the poet's collected\r\npoems; but the second are included, only \"kindly silence\" is replaced by\r\n\"perfect stillness.\" After that Tennyson broke silence no more; and\r\nLytton subsequently made what was put forward as an _amende honorable_,\r\nin a speech at Hertford (October, 1862), when he said that \"we must\r\ncomfort ourselves with the thought so exquisitely expressed by our Poet\r\nLaureate,\" and so forth. The quarrel between _Punch_ and Lytton faded,\r\nfirst into a truce, and then into friendship; and in 1851 we find\r\nseveral of the Staff playing \"Not so Bad as we Seem\"--written specially\r\nfor them--at Devonshire House, before the Queen and the Prince Consort.\r\nIt may not inappropriately be mentioned that when Woolner's bust of\r\nTennyson was presented to Trinity College and the authorities excluded\r\nit from the chapel and library on the ground that there was no precedent\r\nfor paying so much honour to a living person, _Punch_, by the hand of\r\nShirley Brooks, published one of the finest parodies extant of the\r\nLaureate's style, beginning with the line--\r\n\r\n  \"I am not dead; of that I do repent.\"\r\n\r\nIn January, 1847, Horace Smith, the brother of James ---- they of the\r\n\"Rejected Addresses\"--contributed a column \"Christmas Commercial\r\nReport;\" and John Macgregor--\"Rob Roy\"--began his acknowledged series of\r\npapers and sketches with \"Costumes for the Commons\" and \"Meeting of the\r\nStreets,\" the pecuniary results of which he devoted to police-court\r\npoor-boxes. He was hardly more than a lad at the time; but he was\r\nalready a strong writer, and his references to the French Revolution\r\nhave the intrinsic merit that they were written by one who was in Paris\r\nat the time when the \"Citizen King\" took flight to England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY SILVER.\r\n(_From a Photograph by Elliott and Fry._)]\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Silver, ex-_Punch_ Staff officer, first appeared anonymously\r\nin _Punch_ in February, 1848, with an obituary notice, sent from\r\nNorwich, where he was articled to Sir William Foster, Bart., solicitor.\r\nIt was called \"The Death of Mr. Wimbush's Elephant\"--the Jumbo of the\r\nperiod, which had died at the age of eighty-four. He was then only\r\ntwenty years of age, and, encouraged by this success, he began\r\ncontributing trifles to \"The Month.\" This publication was edited by\r\nAlbert Smith in 1851; but although it was illustrated by Leech, and was\r\none of the most genuinely humorous works of its kind, it ran for only\r\nsix months. When \"The Month\" came to a sudden stop, the articles\r\nremaining unpublished were turned over to Mark Lemon to see what use he\r\ncould make of them. Some were by Mr. Silver, who was forthwith summoned\r\nfrom his anonymity by a line in _Punch_: \"'Naughty Boy' has not sent his\r\naddress.\" Mark Lemon was not kept waiting for the answer, and after\r\npaying him for several of his previous contributions (an attention\r\nhighly appreciated) he at once installed the young man as a writer at\r\nthe rate of one guinea per column. This, in due course, was raised to\r\nthirty shillings, and at that remained until 1881, when he received a\r\nweekly stipend of six guineas, which the Editor declared to be the\r\nmaximum then payable to a _Punch_ writer. Some years previous to this,\r\nand soon after the death of Douglas Jerrold, Mr. Silver had been\r\nsummoned to occupy the place at the Table left vacant by the great\r\nsatirist. \"My chief work,\" he writes in answer to my inquiry, \"was in\r\nthe decade ending with the 'Sixties, though it by no means ceased then.\r\nI often filled four or five columns a week, and contributed '_Punch's_\r\nHistory of Costume'\" (illustrated by Tenniel), \"'Our Dramatic\r\nCorrespondent,' 'Our Dramatic Spectator,' with a great amount of prose\r\nand verse, and sundry pages of the 'Essence of Parliament' when Shirley\r\nBrooks was away.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Mr. Silver's greatest service to _Punch_, as elsewhere\r\nexplained, was his introduction of Charles Keene, with whom he was very\r\nintimate for more than forty years. His friendship with Leech, a\r\nfellow-Carthusian, though of course greatly his senior, is another\r\ninteresting passage of his life, testified to by the many hunting\r\nsketches which, with a score or more of Keene's, decorated the billiard\r\nroom of the fine old house in Kensington where Leech had died, and which\r\nMr. Silver subsequently occupied until it was pulled down in 1893.\r\n\r\nAt Leech's death Mr. Silver was invited by Mark Lemon to apply to the\r\nGovernors of Charterhouse for the gift of an admission into \"Gown-boys\"\r\nfor the son of the great draughtsman who had been so good a friend.\r\nAfter many fruitless efforts he was at length successful, and received\r\nthe welcome present from the hands of Lord John Russell--as is set forth\r\nelsewhere. On the death of Lemon, Mr. Silver severed his regular\r\nconnection with _Punch_.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the brilliant journalist Mr. Sutherland Edwards was the\r\nother event of 1848. \"I was engaged on _Punch_,\" he says, \"at the\r\nrecommendation of Gilbert à Beckett, who had thought well of satirical\r\nverses and poems contributed by me to a paper called 'Pasquin.' Douglas\r\nJerrold, however, had been attacked rather severely in 'Pasquin;' not by\r\nme, but by James Hannay. Hannay and myself wrote the whole of 'Pasquin'\r\nup to the time of my quitting that publication in order to write for\r\n_Punch_; and we considered ourselves jointly responsible for what\r\nappeared in its columns. Jerrold was away in the Channel Islands at the\r\ntime of my being engaged on _Punch_; and on his return to London he\r\nshowed himself annoyed (not unnaturally, perhaps) at the Editor, Mark\r\nLemon, having engaged me. 'Two youths,' he was reported to have said,\r\n'throw mud at me, and because one of them hits me in the eye you clasp\r\nhim to your bosom.' Mark Lemon now asked me to give up writing for\r\n_Punch_, but to contribute as much as I liked to a magazine he was about\r\nto start with the assistance of the contributors to _Punch_. It was to\r\nhave been called 'The Gallanty Show;' but it never came out. After I had\r\ncontributed to _Punch_ for some weeks, I wrote a few articles for one of\r\n'_Punch's_ Pocket-Books;' then finding I was not wanted, I ceased to\r\nsend in contributions, and my engagement came to an end.... I resumed my\r\nconnection with _Punch_ when Mr. Burnand became Editor (thirty-two years\r\nafterwards), and still write for it from time to time, but only as an\r\noccasional contributor.\" In this year Richard Doyle made a slight\r\nliterary appearance in the paper, with an article on \"High Art and the\r\nRoyal Academy.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Dickens is supposed to have contributed to _Punch_ in the\r\nfollowing year (1849) an article entitled \"Dreadful Hardships Endured by\r\nthe Shipwrecked Crew of the _London_, Chiefly for Want of Water\"--a\r\ncriticism on the scandalous condition of the suburban water supply. Mr.\r\nF. G. Kitton has examined the original manuscript preserved by Mrs. Mark\r\nLemon in her autograph album. Mr. Hatton found it among Lemon's papers,\r\nbearing on the outside, in the Editor's handwriting, the inscription,\r\n\"Dickens' only contribution to _Punch_!\" But the alleged contribution is\r\nabsolutely undiscoverable in the pages of the paper. The explanation is,\r\nin Mr. Kitten's words, that \"about the time the manuscript was written,\r\nseveral pictorial allusions to foul water in suburban London appeared in\r\n_Punch_, which bear directly upon the subject of Dickens's protest, and\r\nit is surmised that the Editor, on the receipt of Dickens's\r\ncontribution, considered that greater prominence would be given to the\r\nmatter to which they referred by means of a cartoon than by a few lines\r\nof text. Hence we find the rebuke enforced by the pencil of the artist,\r\ninstead of the mere literary lashing which Dickens intended to inflict\r\nupon that particular public grievance.\" It may safely be suggested that\r\nthis was the only occasion on which, after his reputation was made,\r\nDickens was ever \"declined with thanks.\" This MS., it may be added, was\r\nsold at Sotheby's on the 9th of July, 1889, and was knocked down for\r\n£16.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES DICKENS' SOLE (AND REJECTED) CONTRIBUTION.\r\n(_By Permission of Mr. F. G. Kitton and Mr F. Sabin._)]\r\n\r\nThe curious fact remains that Dickens, who was the intimate friend of\r\n_Punch's_ Editor for the best part of their working lives, whose\r\npublishers were _Punch's_ proprietors as well as the publishers and part\r\nproprietors of the \"Daily News,\" which Dickens edited, never contributed\r\nto _Punch_, nor was in any way identified with it, save, indeed, with\r\nits Dinner-Table. At that function he was at one time a frequent\r\nvisitor, and also was he present when at the Prince of Wales's wedding a\r\nbrilliant company assembled at the publishing office to see the\r\n_cortège_ go by. It was on that occasion that Sothern, one of the\r\ninvited guests, arrived on the other side of the way, but, owing to the\r\ndenseness of the crowd, was utterly unable to force his way across. His\r\nfriends caught sight of him, and pointed to a policeman. Sothern took\r\nthe hint. \"Get me through,\" he whispered, \"and I'll give you a\r\nsovereign.\" \"Afraid I can't,\" said the man regretfully, \"but I'll try.\"\r\nA prodigious effort was made, but unsuccessfully, loud protests going up\r\nfrom the packed crowd. Sothern was at his wits' end; he could not bear\r\nthe thought of losing such a dinner in such a company, but his invention\r\ndid not fail him. \"Look here,\" he said to the constable; \"put your\r\nhandcuffs on me, drag me through, and land me at that door, and I'll\r\ngive you _two_ pounds.\" The man seized the idea and Sothern together; he\r\nslipped on the handcuffs, and with a loud \"Make way, there!\" dragged his\r\nprize through a mass of humanity that was only too happy to assist the\r\nlaw as far as might be; and after a few moments of crushing, pushing,\r\nand general rough handling, the dishevelled comedian was successfully\r\nlanded at _Punch's_ publishing door. \"You'll find the money in my\r\nwaistcoat pocket,\" said Sothern. But he did not observe that, after the\r\npoliceman had secured it, a stealthy addition was made to the money in\r\nthe constabular palm by one of his _Punch_ friends; and only when the\r\nman disappeared in the crowd did Sothern realise that a timely bribe had\r\nleft him to mix with his friends for the rest of the day and to eat his\r\ndinner with hands firmly secured in his manacles!\r\n\r\nIt is said that Dickens held aloof from _Punch_ on account of\r\nThackeray's success in it. If so, the jealousy must have been all on\r\nDickens' side; for Thackeray's well-known exclamation, when he hurried\r\ninto the _Punch_ office and slapped down before Lemon the latest number\r\nof \"Dombey and Son\" containing Paul Dombey's death, \"It's stupendous!\r\nunsurpassed! There's no writing against such power as this!\" was that of\r\na generous and magnanimous man. Bryan Proctor (\"Barry Cornwall\"),\r\nwriting to E. Fitzgerald in 1870, said, \"I saw a good deal of Thackeray\r\nuntil his death.... I did not observe much jealousy in Thackeray towards\r\nDickens, nor _vice versâ_. They travelled pretty comfortably on their\r\ndusty road together. Each had a quantity of good-nature, and each could\r\nafford to be liberal to the other.\" The probable explanation is that\r\nDickens simply did not care to interrupt his triumphant career of\r\nnovelist in order to write occasional articles in a paper in which\r\nanonymity was the rule and rejection so painfully possible.\r\n\r\nOnce, however, by the hand of Leech, Dickens made an appearance in\r\n_Punch_, and, curiously enough, only once. This was in the drawing of\r\nthe awful appearance of a \"wopps\" at a picnic (p. 76, Vol. XVII.), where\r\nthe novelist appears as the handsome, but not very striking, youth\r\nattendant on the young lady who is overcome at the distressing\r\nsituation. It must be admitted that the portrait is hardly recognisable.\r\n\r\nBut a serious quarrel broke out between Dickens and the _Punch_ men,\r\npublishers and Editor alike--a quarrel wholly on Dickens's side. So\r\ngreat had been his intimacy and his influence that he could cause the\r\ninsertion of a cartoon and even bring about the alteration of the Dinner\r\nday. But now, on the unhappy differences between himself and his wife,\r\ntrouble arose between old friends. Mark Lemon had naturally leaned\r\ntowards the wife, from chivalry and sense of right, and the publishers\r\npreferred to take no share in a quarrel in which they certainly had no\r\nconcern. On May 28, 1859, the whole of the back page of _Punch_ was\r\ngiven to an advertisement of \"Once a Week,\" which was to follow\r\n\"Household Words,\" and to an explanation of the position of affairs\r\nbetween \"Mr. Charles Dickens and his late Publishers.\" The following\r\nparagraphs are all that it is needful to quote from the statement:--\r\n\r\n     \"So far as 1836, Bradbury and Evans had business relations with Mr.\r\n     Dickens, and, in 1844, an agreement was entered into by which they\r\n     acquired an interest in all the works he might write, or in any\r\n     periodical he might originate, during a term of seven years. Under\r\n     this agreement Bradbury and Evans became possessed of a joint,\r\n     though unequal, interest with Mr. Dickens in 'Household Words,'\r\n     commenced in 1850. Friendly relations had simultaneously sprung up\r\n     between them, and they were on terms of close intimacy in 1858,\r\n     when circumstances led to Mr. Dickens's publication of a statement,\r\n     on the subject of his conjugal differences, in various newspapers,\r\n     including 'Household Words' of June 12th.\r\n\r\n     \"The public disclosure of these differences took most people by\r\n     surprise, and was notoriously the subject of comments, by no means\r\n     complimentary to Mr. Dickens himself, as regarded the taste of this\r\n     proceeding. On June 17th, however, Bradbury and Evans learnt from a\r\n     common friend, that Mr. Dickens had resolved to break off his\r\n     connection with them, because this statement was not printed in the\r\n     number of _Punch_ published the day preceding--in other words,\r\n     because it did not occur to Bradbury and Evans to exceed their\r\n     legitimate functions as proprietors and publishers, and to require\r\n     the insertion of statements on a domestic and painful subject in\r\n     the inappropriate columns of a comic miscellany. No previous\r\n     request for the insertion of this statement had been made either to\r\n     Bradbury and Evans, or to the editor of _Punch_, and the grievance\r\n     of Mr. Dickens substantially amounted to this, that Bradbury and\r\n     Evans did not take upon themselves, unsolicited, to gratify an\r\n     eccentric wish by a preposterous action.... Bradbury and Evans\r\n     replied that they did not, and could not, believe that this was the\r\n     sole cause of Mr. Dickens's altered feeling towards them; but they\r\n     were assured that it _was_ the sole cause, and that Mr. Dickens\r\n     desired to bear testimony to their integrity and zeal as his\r\n     publishers, but that his resolution was formed, and nothing could\r\n     alter it.\"\r\n\r\nSo this foolish estrangement went on until, years afterwards, Clarkson\r\nStanfield on his death-bed besought Dickens to resume his friendship\r\nwith the man with whom, after all, he had had no cause of quarrel. So\r\nDickens sent to Lemon (whom he doubtless suspected of having written\r\nthe publishers' damaging defence just quoted) a kindly letter when\r\n\"Uncle Mark\" appeared as Falstaff before the public, and when Stanfield\r\nwas buried the two men clasped hands over his open grave; and later on,\r\nwhen Dickens died, some of the most touching and beautiful verses that\r\never appeared in _Punch_ were devoted to his memory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES HANNAY.\r\n(_From a photograph by T. Rogers._)]\r\n\r\nIn 1850 appeared James Hannay, Mr. Sutherland Edwards' associate in\r\n\"Pasquin,\" and founder (I am informed by his cousin, Mr. J. L. Hannay,\r\nthe police magistrate) of \"The Puppet Show.\" It was when he was\r\napproached by the proprietors of this periodical (the Vizetelly\r\nbrothers), and was asked to write for it as well--\"Something in the\r\nmanner of Sterne, with a dash of Swift\"--he replied that in that case\r\nhis remuneration would have to be \"Something in the manner of\r\nRothschild, with a dash of Baring.\" Hannay was at that time on the\r\n\"Morning Chronicle,\" after having, like Jerrold and Stanfield, given a\r\ntrial to the Royal Navy and found it wanting. He literally fought his\r\nway into _Punch_, just as Shirley Brooks did a few years subsequently,\r\nand was assisted from within by the kindly appreciation of Thackeray.\r\nPerhaps Jerrold was reconciled to the accession in view of Hannay having\r\nstarted \"The Puppet Show\" with the main object of violently assaulting\r\nhis old friend and chum Mr. Edwards, who, in spite of all journalistic\r\namenities, remained his chum, for these assaults were only attacks _pour\r\nrire_.\r\n\r\nFor a time Hannay's pen was of the utmost value to _Punch_. His earliest\r\ncontributions were notes on a tour in Scotland--his native country--he\r\ndescribing himself as \"The Scotchman _who went back again_.\" But he did\r\nnot remain very long with _Punch_; besides being a wit, he was a scholar\r\nwith a very serious side to his character, and the amusement of the\r\npublic became, in his eyes, less important than their instruction. He\r\nwas only twenty-three when he produced his first novel of \"Singleton\r\nFontenoy, R.N.,\" which so pleased Carlyle that it induced the old\r\nphilosopher to invite him to his house. Then he turned lecturer on\r\nliterary subjects, became \"Quarterly\" reviewer, married a daughter of\r\nKenny Meadows, took to diplomacy in a small way, and was appointed Her\r\nMajesty's Consul at Barcelona, where he died in 1873. Mr. Holman Hunt,\r\none of the band of wits and youthful geniuses of whom Hannay was the\r\nwittiest of all, writes to me of him as \"a contributor of great power\r\nwho might with self-control have gained a great position--a friend who\r\nused to come on our nocturnal boating expeditions up the river. He was\r\none of the dear crew who in different capacities and with varied powers\r\nonce manned life's larger boat with me.\"\r\n\r\nSir John Tenniel contributed a few pieces in 1851 (p. 56, Vol. XX.) and\r\nlater, but they were of little importance. Cuthbert Bede was as much a\r\nwriter as a draughtsman, as he showed by his parody of the \"High-mettled\r\nRacer.\" Then came another of _Punch's_ stars of the first magnitude,\r\nShirley Brooks.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] Mark Lemon.\r\n\r\n[43] The author here quotes in a footnote a few lines from the poem,\r\nbeginning\r\n\r\n  \"O, darling room, my heart's delight\"----\r\n\r\nand then observes: \"The whole of this _Poem_ (!!!) is worth reading, in\r\norder to see to what depths of silliness the human intellect can\r\ndescend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n_PUNCH'S_ WRITERS: 1852-78.\r\n\r\n     Shirley Brooks--His Wit and Humour--Training--Lays Siege to\r\n     _Punch_--And Carries him by Assault--\"Essence of\r\n     Parliament\"--William Brough--Mr. Beatty Kingston--F.

His rapidity was extraordinary. The clergyman who boasted that\r\nhe could write a sermon in an hour \"and think nothing of it\" courted the\r\nreply that probably the congregation thought nothing of it either. But\r\nthe single hour in which Brooks began and finished the composition of\r\nhis \"Rime of the Ancient Alderman\" (1855)--a poem of fifty stanzas, that\r\nfills nine pages in his volume of selected work--brought him criticism\r\nof a different sort. His facility was not less astonishing, and I have\r\nheard repeated some of his flashes of epigram enclosed in polished verse\r\nwhich it would be hard to believe were extempore but for the\r\ncircumstances under which they were inspired. Indeed, his fancy, like\r\nhimself, was a diamond of great fire and high polish, and rich by\r\nbounteous favour of nature. He was as witty as Jerrold without the\r\nsting; but, when he chose, he could strike as hard, and, as he himself\r\nonce said, never care \"a horse's mamma.\"\r\n\r\nHe had been articled to a solicitor, but he preferred the comic muse,\r\nand _Punch_ on \"Joe Miller\" was more to him than Coke upon Littleton.\r\nHis humorous prose and graceful witty verse were cast upon the waters of\r\nthe comic press. He was thirty-two before he had his best chance of\r\nmaking himself widely known in the line he especially loved. This was in\r\n1847, when he began to write for the \"Man in the Moon,\" which was just\r\nstarted under the editorship of two _Punch_ men--Albert Smith and Angus\r\nB. Reach. For the latter he had a close and tender friendship. When\r\nReach fell ill, Brooks did all his journalistic work for months, and\r\nwould touch not a penny of the money; as the cheques arrived, they were\r\nimmediately forwarded for the benefit of the sufferer. He was his\r\ncolleague on the \"Morning Chronicle,\" for which Brooks was\r\ngallery-reporter in the House of Commons for five sessions as well as\r\nleader-writer, and when Reach was sent through France on an expedition\r\nof inquiry into the condition of the agricultural classes, Brooks was\r\ndespatched through South Russia, Asia Minor, and Egypt. And in 1852 he\r\nwrote in conjunction with him \"A Story with a Vengeance,\" which was\r\npartly illustrated by Charles Keene; but the artist was at that time so\r\nlittle known that it was not considered worth the publisher's while to\r\nmention his name.\r\n\r\nUnder Reach's editorship, then, he appeared in the \"Man in the Moon,\"\r\nand the next year (1848) in Hannay's \"Puppet Show.\" It was for the pages\r\nof the former (November, 1847) that Brooks wrote one of the severest\r\nassaults on _Punch_ ever published--the more severe for the excellence\r\nof its quality. It was entitled \"Our Flight with _Punch_\" (in imitation\r\nof Tom Taylor's \"Flight with Russell\" and his far less happy \"Flight\r\nwith Louis Philippe,\" in _Punch_, August and October, 1847, Volume\r\nXIII.), in which the \"Man in the Moon\" was supposed to fly, genie-like,\r\nwith _Punch_ over the land which at one time he ruled with his wit; and\r\nthe \"Dreary Hunchback,\" as he was apostrophised, was caustically\r\nbesought to awake and stem the tide of his supposed degeneration. It is\r\nhardly surprising that this poem, clever as it is, was not reprinted in\r\nthe posthumous collection of the writer's poems.\r\n\r\nBut not immediately did he conquer his position. There were still years\r\nto wait, which were occasionally occupied with a pleasing attack on\r\n_Punch_, one of which, it is said, drew from Leech his picture of two\r\nlittle \"snobs\" in a low coffee-house. \"_Punch_ is very dummy and slow\r\nthis week, I think,\" says the first disreputable-looking \"fast man.\" \"So\r\ndo I,\" replies the other. \"It's their own fault, too, for I sent 'em\r\nsome dem'd funny articles, which the humbugs sent me back.\" \"That's just\r\nthe way they served me,\" resumes his friend--\"the great fools!\" But at\r\nlast, at the end of 1851, his first contribution to _Punch_ was\r\nreceived, and he was soon invited to join the Staff. He was not long in\r\nmaking a mark with \"Miss Violet,\" but it was not among his strongest\r\ncontributions. Nevertheless, \"Epicurus Rotundus\" was now a made man on\r\nthe highway to success.\r\n\r\nIt was his charm and grace as much as his vigour that compelled the\r\nadmiration of his fellows and their admission that he was the most\r\nvaluable accession that the Staff had ever received. At the dinner given\r\nto Thackeray in 1856, Jerrold, in proposing Brooks's health, pronounced\r\nhim \"the most rising journalist of the day,\" and Mark Lemon declared\r\nopenly that \"Shirley's pen is the gracefullest in London.\" It was, in\r\nfact, the general opinion at the time that his verses combined much of\r\nthe technical merit of Pope's with the keen sarcasm of Swift; and of\r\nsuch verse he contributed not fewer than six hundred pieces in the\r\ncourse of his _Punch_ career. One of their merits was the unexpected\r\nspontaneity of their humour--the faculty that is distinctive of some of\r\nthe best of his _mots_, such as that when looking at Edmund Yates's\r\nbook-shelves which caused him to pause before one of the volumes and\r\nread off \"Homer's Iliad,\" and murmur, \"Homer's--Yes--_that is the\r\nbest_.\" On one occasion he, with Mr. George Chester (my informant), was\r\non a visit to Mark Lemon at Crawley, and at the breakfast-table a\r\ndiscussion arose between the two men upon noses, their shapes and\r\ncharacteristics. Turning kindly to one of his host's little daughters,\r\nand looking at her delicate little _nez retroussé_, he said, \"When they\r\nwere looking about for a nose for you, my dear, they chose the first\r\nthat turned up\"--a joke often since repeated and well-nigh worked to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe contribution by which he will certainly be best and most gratefully\r\nremembered is his \"Essence of Parliament\"--a work which was entirely his\r\nown conception, and which was continued for twenty years from week to\r\nweek while Parliament was sitting, with cleverness, refinement, truth,\r\nand humour that are invaluable to the historian and delightful to the\r\ngeneral reader. For this work his experience and training as the\r\n\"Chronicle\" reporter were invaluable to him. Brooks was essentially a\r\npolitician in feeling, full of suggestion--apt, happy, and\r\ningenious--and yet could turn with ease and equal facility to social,\r\nliterary, poetical, or art-critical work, to his daily \"leader\" or\r\nweekly article for the \"Illustrated London News.\" He was in his time the\r\ncartoon suggestor-in-chief, and towards the end of Mark Lemon's life\r\nrendered great assistance in the editorship of the paper; although\r\nPercival Leigh was the recognised _locum tenens_. Lemon had been dead\r\nbut just a week when Brooks wrote (June 1st, 1870) from the _Punch_\r\noffice to a friend:--\r\n\r\n     \"Yesterday I accepted the Editorship of _Punch_. It will be a tie,\r\n     and give me trouble, but I seem to have been generally expected to\r\n     take the situation, and it is not good to disappoint General\r\n     Expectations, as he is a stern officer. Wish me good fortune--but I\r\n     know you do.\r\n\r\n     \"I was offered a seat on a four-horse coach, for the Derby,\r\n     alongside M. Gustave Doré. But I am here. Who says I have no\r\n     self-denial?\"\r\n\r\n--which shows that he was already in harness.\r\n\r\nIn his editorship he took the utmost pride, and he would defend his\r\npaper with spirit. When an ill-mannered acquaintance told him \"that of\r\nall the London papers he considered _Punch_ the dullest,\" Brooks\r\nreplied, \"I wonder you ever read it.\" \"I don't,\" said the other. \"So I\r\nthought,\" retorted the Editor, \"by your foolish remark.\"\r\n\r\nShirley Brooks fell ill with a complication of disorders, and Mr.\r\nBurnand did him the same service on _Punch_ that he had done for Lemon,\r\nand that Leigh did for himself and Tom Taylor. When he was near his end,\r\nand a newspaper acquaintance called persistently to inquire how he was\r\nprogressing, \"Tell him,\" said the sick man, with a shrewd smile about\r\nhis lips, \"that he shall have his 'par' in good time.\" He was engaged in\r\nwriting \"Election Epigrams\" and \"The Situation\" on his death-bed; and\r\ndied in February, 1874, before their publication. He was buried in the\r\ncemetery of Kensal Green, close to where Thackeray lay by Leech, and\r\nwithin whose walls, though at some distance apart, Doyle was to sleep,\r\nand Henry Mayhew.\r\n\r\nNeither Robert nor William Brough ever drew for _Punch_, but it is the\r\nbelief of their brother, Mr. Lionel Brough, that they were both at one\r\ntime literary contributors. Of this, however, I have no record. William\r\nwas brother-in-law to Mark Lemon, but the two men were not on the best\r\nof terms. Robert, a provincial Jerrold, with all Douglas's power of\r\nsarcasm and some of his genius, had started the \"Liverpool Lion,\" and\r\nwas a brilliant comic draughtsman. It was the success of his play, \"The\r\nEnchanted Isle,\" that brought him to London, where he wrote burlesques\r\nand so forth; but he will be remembered for his clever illustrations to\r\nmost of _Punch's_ rivals of his time, as well as his creation of \"Billie\r\nBarlow\"--the \"Ally Sloper\" of the day; and it was not to _Punch's_\r\nadvantage that he did not enlist Brough's humorous talent.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1854--or it may have been a few months later--Mr. W. Beatty\r\nKingston made an early appearance with a cockney ballad on the subject\r\nof the admission of female searchers to the penetralia of H.M. Record\r\nOffice, of which at that time he was a \"flickering light\" at £100 a\r\nyear. Soon he took service under the Hapsburgs, and left England\r\nafterwards for nearly a quarter of a century. In 1883 he resumed comic\r\noperations on the invitation of Mr. Burnand, and continued, until June,\r\n1887, to contribute a good deal of verse, illustrated by Mr. Sambourne\r\nand Mr. Furniss. Many of these pieces have since been republished in \"My\r\nHansom Lays;\" while of those which have since appeared some, such as \"A\r\nTriplet\" and \"The Wizard's Curse,\" have passed into the category of\r\n\"stock recitations.\"\r\n\r\nThen F. I. Scudamore, still remembered for his _vers de société_, was a\r\npassing contributor. But in 1855 he joined \"The Comic Times,\" with other\r\nof old _Punch_ outsiders, and then obtained an appointment in the\r\nGovernment Telegraphs, and, with a Companionship of the Bath, the\r\nsuperintendence of the Constantinople Post Office.\r\n\r\nMr. Ashby-Sterry's name belongs to the following year, but he appeared\r\nsolely as a draughtsman; his literary connection, which began\r\ntwenty-four years later, will be spoken of in its proper place. Michael\r\nJohn Barry was another who at this time (1857) shed no little brilliancy\r\non _Punch_; and to him is now credited the admirable \"Peccavi\"\r\ndespatch--perhaps the most finished and pointed that ever appeared in\r\n_Punch's_ pages, and certainly one of the most highly appreciated and\r\nmost loudly applauded:--\r\n\r\n  \"'_Peccavi!_ I've _Scinde_,' said Lord Ellen[44] so proud--\r\n  Dalhousie, more modest, said '_Vovi_, I've _Oude_!'\"\r\n\r\nThis brilliant couplet, according to the \"Times,\" is said to have been\r\ncontended for by \"both _Punch_ and Thomas Hood;\" and it never was\r\nfinally decided which of the two great humorists followed the other.\r\nTheir claims, indeed, are not irreconcilable. Latterly, the credit has\r\nbeen claimed, with some show of authority, for Barry, who was generally\r\nregarded in his day as one of Jerrold's peers in wit. It is curious to\r\nobserve that in the House of Commons debate on the Candahar question,\r\nMr. P. J. Smyth was reported to have referred to \"the unexampled brevity\r\nof the General's despatch after he had won his great victory on the\r\nIndus,\" in the quaint belief that the first half-line of the epigram was\r\nLord Ellenborough's actual report.\r\n\r\nThe Very Rev. Reynolds Hole, Dean of Rochester, always a spoilt child of\r\n_Punch's_, and the intimate friend of Leech, was more of a _Punch_ man\r\nthan most contributors, as he was one of the very few outsiders who were\r\never entertained at the Wednesday Dinner.[45] \"Some six-and-thirty years\r\nago,\" he informed me, \"Mark Lemon wrote to me, '_Punch_ is proud of such\r\na contributor,' and I have his letter. I wrote a few short paragraphs\r\nabout Oxford, and some longer articles in verse, entitled 'The\r\nSportsman's Dream' and 'My Butler.' Leech told me, 'You are an honorary\r\nmember of our weekly meetings, and will be always welcome.'\" His\r\ncharming book, \"A Little Tour in Ireland,\" written \"by an Oxonian,\" had\r\nthe advantage of Leech's pencil, and by his friendship with that artist,\r\nas well as with Thackeray and others of the Staff, he was for a time\r\nidentified in some measure with _Punch_ itself, besides obtaining\r\nrecognition as the beau-ideal of \"the genial, jolly parson.\" That he did\r\nnot become a regular contributor to the paper was due, it is believed,\r\nto a subsequent misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nIn \"Jack Easel,\" the writer of a number of delightful letters upon\r\nartistic and social topics at home and abroad, it is difficult to\r\nrecognise Mr. Charles L. Eastlake, the able Keeper of the National\r\nGallery. From 1859 to the autumn of 1862 Mr. Eastlake contributed\r\neight-and-twenty articles of importance, one of them in verse, and the\r\nmajority headed \"Our Roving Correspondent.\" \"Jack Easel on the\r\nContinent\" and \"The Royal Academy Exhibition\" were the subjects of many\r\nof them, and their note was lively enough to cause his papers to be\r\nlooked forward to by _Punch's_ readers.\r\n\r\nMr. Francis Cowley Burnand, when he first appeared in _Punch_, in 1863,\r\nwas no mere recruit; he was a proved humorist, though of short standing,\r\nand his début was an astonishing success. His début, that is to say, as\r\na _Punch_ writer, for eight years previously he had sent up from\r\nCambridge a couple of drawings which Leech had made artistically\r\nsuitable for publication.\r\n\r\nMr. Burnand was born in 1837--having been too gallant, it was said, to\r\ncome into the world before his Queen had ascended the throne, and too\r\nloyal and zealous to delay his appearance after she had taken her place.\r\nHe was sent to Eton, where, however, he did not care much for football,\r\nbeing, as he expressed it, \"more shinned against than shinning;\" and\r\nthence, at the age of seventeen, he went into Trinity College,\r\nCambridge. In three years he had graduated and had founded the still\r\nflourishing \"A.D.C.;\" at the same time, he determined to enter the\r\nChurch. He placed himself under the Rev. H. P. (afterwards Canon)\r\nLiddon; but soon left for the seminary of the Oblates of St. Charles, at\r\nBayswater, the head of which was Dr. (Cardinal) Manning. While there his\r\npassion for playwriting was too strong to be resisted, and before he\r\nleft Dr. Manning confessed that he feared his young friend had no\r\n\"vocation,\" _i.e._ for the ecclesiastical state. Mr. Burnand, taking a\r\nwider view of the term, entirely acquiesced with Dr. Manning, and added\r\nrather timidly that he \"thought he had a vocation for the stage.\" Dr.\r\nManning raised his eyebrows, wrinkled his forehead, sniffed, and then\r\nsaid: \"A 'vocation' concerns the spiritual welfare. You cannot speak of\r\n'going on the stage' as a 'vocation.' You might as well call 'being a\r\ncobbler' a 'vocation.'\" \"Well, yes, Dr. Manning,\" rejoined Mr. Burnand\r\nvery nervously; \"but--if I were a cobbler I should still have the cure\r\nof soles.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: F. C. BURNAND.\r\n(_From a Photograph by F. T. Palmer, Ramsgate._)]\r\n\r\nAn unsuccessful trial of the stage at Edinburgh, and a call to the Bar\r\nin 1862, indirectly shaped Mr. Burnand's career, and, throwing him into\r\nplaywriting and humorous journalism, led him quickly into a talented\r\ncircle. With Mr. W. S. Gilbert, H. J. Byron, Matt Morgan, Jeff Prowse,\r\nand others, Mr. Burnand helped to strengthen Tom Hood's additional staff\r\nof \"Fun,\" then newly established, under the proprietorship of a\r\nlooking-glass maker, named Maclean--whom, by reason of his expansive\r\nsmile and shining teeth, Byron used to call \"Maclean teeth.\" Mr.\r\nBurnand's fresh and bright productions sparkled on the pages and caught\r\nthe eye of Mark Lemon; but it was an unusually happy and original idea\r\nthat was to bring the two men closely together. Mr. Burnand had\r\nconceived a series of burlesque stories, satirising the sensational\r\nstyle of the day, to be accompanied by an equally burlesque imitation of\r\nthe illustrations that were to be seen in publications such as the\r\n\"London Journal.\" To his own daughter, as \"one of his oldest friends,\"\r\nMr. Burnand once confided the following facts and circumstances for\r\npublication:--\r\n\r\n     \"The astute proprietor of 'Fun,' in which I had achieved some\r\n     success, observed that 'Mokeanna' wouldn't do. I am not sure but\r\n     that he was right; but if he had been a literary editor he would\r\n     have seen the idea in a rough copy, and would have suggested\r\n     improvement. This good he did me, however--I read it to a friend,\r\n     who thought some of it good and most of it the contrary, and so, in\r\n     a temper, I burnt the entire manuscript, and, being quite sure of\r\n     the humour of the idea, commenced rewriting it. Then I communicated\r\n     with Mark Lemon; he jumped at the idea--determined to say nothing\r\n     to anybody, except those who had to illustrate it, and the first\r\n     number of 'Mokeanna' appeared on February 21st, 1863, with an\r\n     illustration by Sir John Gilbert, burlesquing his own style, whilst\r\n     the page in _Punch_ was, in arrangement, a facsimile of the 'London\r\n     Journal.' The proprietors rushed down to the office, terrified with\r\n     the thought that, by accident, the 'London Journal' had been sewn\r\n     up with _Punch_, and it took a lot of explanation in Mark Lemon's\r\n     best manner to make them see the joke in its right light. The\r\n     success of the experiment was immediate. Thackeray was supposed to\r\n     have perpetrated the burlesque imitation, but Thackeray knew\r\n     nothing whatever about it, though, as I have since learnt, he was\r\n     greatly tickled by it and, subsequently, was personally most kind\r\n     to the 'New Boy,' as he called me, on the _Punch_ Staff.\"\r\n\r\nThe illusion was complete, and the fun most apt and full of spirit. The\r\nvarious artists (\"Phiz,\" Charles Keene, Mr. du Maurier, and Sir John\r\nMillais) each drew a picture for it, in every case burlesquing his own\r\nstyle and trotting out his peculiarities. The public laughed\r\nheartily--first, at itself for having been deceived by the\r\nverisimilitude to the \"London Journal,\" and then at the work upon its\r\nmerits; and \"Mokeanna, or the White Witness\" became the talk of the\r\nhour, and one of the good things of _Punch_. Charles Dickens was among\r\nthose who most admired the execution of the _jeu d'esprit_, and he\r\ndisplayed considerable interest in the writer.\r\n\r\nIn due time Mr. Burnand was called to the Table. \"My first appearance,\"\r\nhe tells me, \"was at the Inn at Dulwich where _Punch_ sometimes dined in\r\nthe summer in those days. Thackeray drove there, and left early. He had\r\ncome on purpose to be present on this occasion, and before quitting the\r\nroom he paused, placed his hand on my shoulder, and said, 'Gentlemen, I\r\ncongratulate you on the \"New Boy!\"' I felt, and probably looked, very\r\nhot and uncomfortably proud; and then he shook me warmly by the hand.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Burnand's next success--a phenomenal success, too, on which his\r\nreputation as a humorist will stand unshaken--was \"Happy Thoughts.\" For\r\npopularity and for immediate advantage to the paper this clever series,\r\nwith its exquisite fooling and keen appreciation of humour, was second\r\nonly to the \"Caudle Curtain Lectures,\" and among the greatest hits that\r\n_Punch_ has ever made. It has since been admirably translated into\r\nFrench by M. Aurelien de Courson under the title of \"Fridoline!\"--\"happy\r\nthought!\" being, however, somewhat inadequately rendered \"ingénieuse\r\npensée!\" Then followed his imitations of popular writers--including\r\n\"Strapmore,\" by \"Weeder,\" and \"One-and-three,\" by \"Fictor Nogo\"--\"Happy\r\nThought Hall,\" with illustrations by himself, \"More Happy Thoughts,\"\r\n\"Out of Town,\" and many others, which are still to be found on the\r\nbookstalls. His, too, was the song \"His 'Art was true to Poll,\" which\r\nachieved so great a success when Mrs. John Wood introduced it into \"My\r\nMilliner's Bill\" many years after it first appeared in _Punch_.\r\n\r\nAnd in addition to the mass of work he has contributed to _Punch_, there\r\nare \"The Incompleat Angler,\" \"The New History of Sandford and Merton,\"\r\n\"The Real Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,\" more than a hundred\r\nburlesques--beginning with his exceedingly popular perversion of\r\nJerrold's \"Black-Eyed Susan\"--and a number of comedies and adaptations:\r\na total rivalling, and in some cases surpassing, the industry of the\r\nmost hard-working of his predecessors in _Punch's_ editorial chair.\r\nMoreover, he has been a lecturer with \"realistic notions,\" as he proved\r\non the occasion when he was giving a public reading dealing with a\r\nyachting cruise, and, as he stood behind his reading-desk, stooped and\r\nrose with a regular maritime motion, relieved by an occasional roll,\r\nuntil the more susceptible among his audience began seriously to ask\r\nthemselves if they were good enough sailors to sit out the reading to\r\nits ground-swell, breezy end.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1880, after the death of Tom Taylor, Mr. Burnand, who had\r\nbeen acting-editor in his last illness, was called upon to take up the\r\ntask of restoring to _Punch_ its ancient reputation for liveliness and\r\nfun, and with a dinner to every contributor, outside as well as Staff,\r\nthe proprietors inaugurated the new era. Mr. Burnand at once made great\r\nchanges among the outside contributors, and introduced new blood upon\r\nthe Staff. For himself, he showed his chief strength as a punster of\r\nextraordinary ability; probably no one before him ever tied so many and\r\nsuch elaborate knots in his mother-tongue as he. \"Mr. Burnand's puns are\r\ngenerally good, and sometimes very good,\" said a critic in the\r\n\"Spectator;\" \"but they are really too plentiful.... When it comes to be\r\na question of a volume of four hundred pages, with an average of ten\r\npuns to a page, the reader is likely to suffer from an indigestion ...\r\na cake that is all plums is likely to lie rather heavily on the person\r\nwho eats it.\" But he was constrained to admit artistic merit in the\r\nhumour of such passages as this: \"There was a dead pause in the room.\r\nHow long it had been there it was impossible to say, for it was only at\r\nthis minute that the three became aware of it. And the Bishop sniffed\r\nuncomfortably, as though there was something wrong with the drainage.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was something of greater import brought in by Mr. Burnand's\r\neditorship than the literary tone. It was tolerance, political and\r\nreligious, and wider sympathy than had lately been the case. The heavy\r\npolitical partisanship of Tom Taylor gave way to the more beneficent\r\nneutrality of Mr. Burnand--a personal neutrality, at least, even though\r\nWhig proclivities still coloured the cartoons to a certain, yet not\r\nunreasonable degree. And a larger religious tolerance and warmer\r\nmagnanimity developed in _Punch_, such as comes chiefly from quarters\r\nwhere oppression has been known.\r\n\r\nSo he who has been called \"the Commandant of the Household Brigade of\r\nBritish Mirth\" has marched gaily along in _Punch's_ service for more\r\nthan thirty years. Prodigal of his jokes, he sometimes makes the best of\r\nthem outside the pages of his paper. Thus in November, 1893, he wrote to\r\nthe press in contradiction of the statement made by a police-court\r\nprisoner named Burnand, that he was the brother of the editor of\r\n_Punch_: \"I beg to say that I have no brother, and never had any\r\nbrother. I have two half-brothers (this man is neither of them), but two\r\nhalf-brothers don't make one whole brother.\" And people chuckled as the\r\nlittle joke was copied from one paper to another all over the\r\nEnglish-speaking world, and applauded the excellent quaintness of\r\n_Punch's_ Aristophanes. So, when a fictitious dinner of the _Punch_\r\nStaff at Lord Rothschild's was reported in the press, Mr. Burnand\r\nbriefly dismissed the matter with the remark that the only dish\r\nwas--_canard_.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the autumn of 1894, when he fell ill, alarming reports were\r\nspread. One of his colleagues on the Staff received a request for a\r\ncolumn obituary notice of the dying man from the editor of a leading\r\ndaily newspaper. But Mr. Burnand was much better, and was greatly\r\ncheered on learning the particulars. \"Really,\" he said, \"that's more\r\nthan I expected. A column! Why, that's what they gave to Nelson and the\r\nDuke of York!\"\r\n\r\nMr. J. Priestman Atkinson's literary achievements in _Punch_ are spoken\r\nof in the chapter where \"Dumb Crambo's\" pictorial contributions are\r\ntreated. From August, 1877, to October, 1880, they are frequent, and\r\nconsist for the most part of fanciful verse accompanied by cuts from the\r\nsame hand. There is a charming prose story, however, in the Pocket-Book\r\nfor 1879, seasonably entitled \"The Invention of Roast Goose.\" But with\r\nMr. Burnand's editorship Mr. Atkinson's energies were exclusively\r\nconcentrated on humorous sketches and \"Dumb Crambo\" eccentricities.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 Mr. John Hollingshead--\"Practical John\"--was dramatic critic of\r\nthe \"Daily News.\" His notices attracted the attention of Shirley Brooks,\r\nwith the result that he was invited to contribute to _Punch_. But it was\r\nin 1881 that he was taken on the salaried outside Staff, writing for the\r\npaper for several years, chiefly on the subject of social reform. He is\r\nthe inventor, to whom Londoners should be grateful, of \"Mud-Salad\r\nMarket\" and the \"Duke of Mudford;\" and the \"Gates of Gloomsbury,\" \"The\r\nSeldom-at-Home Secretary,\" and \"The Top of the Gaymarket,\" are also his.\r\nIt was with his pen that _Punch_ attacked so lustily our licensing\r\nsystem--or want of system; and from him, too, came the burlesque\r\n\"Schopenhauer Ballads,\" and other contributions, which, many of them,\r\nhave been reprinted in \"Footlights,\" \"Plain English,\" and \"Niagara\r\nSpray.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same year came Mr. R. F. Sketchley, late Librarian of the Dyce\r\nand Forster collection in the South Kensington Museum, who was destined\r\nto become one of _Punch's_ Staff officers. \"I find,\" he writes, \"that I\r\nbecame a contributor to _Punch_ in 1864. At the beginning of 1868 I was\r\nhonoured with an invitation from Mark Lemon to join the Table. I served\r\nalso under his successors--Shirley Brooks, Tom Taylor, and Burnand; and\r\nfinally retired of my own accord in 1880. I have seen it stated that in\r\nan illness of Shirley Brooks I did some of the 'Essence of Parliament.'\r\nIf I had been called on to take up the pen of that most brilliant man of\r\nletters, I should have been in despair. All I did was to turn the\r\nQueen's Speech on the opening of Parliament into verse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R. F. SKETCHLEY.\r\n(_From a Photograph by Hills and Saunders, Oxford._)]\r\n\r\n\"I was never a prominent member of the Staff, but I am, and always shall\r\nbe, proud of having been connected with _Punch_. I wrote both prose and\r\nverse--more of the former than the latter--and my contributions ranged\r\nin extent from a column down to a single line. My subjects were\r\ngenerally 'topical,' sometimes 'imaginary,' and the verse included a\r\ngood many parodies.\" Mr. Sketchley, it should be observed, is one of the\r\nfew members of the inside Staff--at least, within the last forty\r\nyears--who have ever resigned their appointments, Richard Doyle, Mr.\r\nHenry Silver, and Mr. Harry Furniss being the others. His strong point\r\nwas prose parody, the best, perhaps, being the quaint quasi-Gulliverian\r\nsketch called \"A Fortnight in Sparsandria,\" which he contributed to\r\n_Punch's_ Pocket-Book. Sober in judgment and wise in counsel, he was\r\ngreatly missed when his genial companionship was lost to _Punch's_\r\nKnights of the Round Table.\r\n\r\nPassing over Mr. W. S. Gilbert's connection with the paper--which is\r\ndescribed in the section devoted to artistic contributors--we find\r\nanother humorist, equally distinguished, who identified himself with the\r\npaper the same year, Charles F. Browne, better known as \"Artemus Ward.\"\r\nHe had arrived in England early in the year, and soon after his arrival\r\nhe was invited by Mark Lemon to contribute. Ward was at that time in\r\nfailing health, and, according to his secretary and manager Mr.\r\nKingston, two or three of the papers produced in accordance with the\r\nunderstanding that was entered into were written with painful\r\neffort--the reason, no doubt, why so little of his usually rollicking\r\nhumour is to be found in them. Nowadays many Americans profess to regard\r\n_Punch_ with a sort of scornful amusement, and \"Life,\" with an\r\nassumption of lofty disdain, is for ever sneering at it as a survival of\r\nthe unfittest; and the same line is taken in England by New Journalists\r\nand Newer Critics. Not that the New American Journalist was unknown in\r\nWard's day. He had already declared that \"Shakespeare wrote good plase,\r\nbut he wouldn't have succeeded as the Washington correspondent of a New\r\nYork daily paper. He lacked the reckisit fancy and imagination.\" Anyhow,\r\nhe did not live so near to the _fin de siècle_; nor was he ashamed to\r\nown that for years it had been his pet ambition to write for the \"London\r\nCharivari.\" Unhappily, its realisation came too late to permit him to do\r\njustice to his talent and his humour; and he himself was only too\r\nconscious of his sad shortcoming, or, rather, of his failing powers.\r\nOnly eight papers had come from his hand when it closed in death. In\r\nSeptember the first of his papers was published--\"Personal\r\nRecollections;\" the last in November--\"A Visit to the British Museum;\"\r\nthey are garrulous and discursive, and a good deal of the humour they\r\ncontain was repeated from earlier works. That they should have contained\r\nany at all, under the circumstances, is the wonder; indeed, one is\r\nirresistibly reminded by them of his own humorous reference to one of\r\nthe burlesque \"pictures\" illustrative of his \"Lecture.\" \"It is by the\r\nOld Masters,\" he said, in his quaint, sad way; \"it is the last thing\r\nthey did before dying. They did this, and then they died.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"ARTEMUS WARD.\"\r\n(_From a Photograph by S. A. Walker._)]\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, curious how many of _Punch's_ most valued contributors\r\nwere working for the paper up to within a few hours, a few minutes, of\r\nbeing called away--Jerrold, Thomas Hood, C. H. Bennett, John Leech,\r\nShirley Brooks, and Artemus Ward; and many a time have the public\r\nlaughed aloud at jokes and pictures wrought when the hand was stiffening\r\nin death, when the brain that had imagined them had already ceased to\r\nthink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H. SAVILE CLARKE\r\n(_From a Photograph by the Woodburytype Company._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nH. Savile Clarke, previously a \"Fun\" contributor, and a disciple of\r\nJames Hannay, made his _Punch_ début with a set of verses in August,\r\n1867; but he did not follow them up, except in a very small way, until\r\nMr. Burnand's editorship, in 1880, encouraged him to write regularly.\r\nThis he soon began to do, his main work being Society verse, mostly\r\nbearing on medical and scientific subjects, for he was brought up as a\r\ndoctor. \"Songs of the Sciences,\" \"Lyrics in a Library\" (verse on books),\r\nverse on the minor picture exhibitions, clever trifles like the \"Carmen\r\nCulinarium\" (December, 1891), and the important and strikingly able and\r\nsuccessful parody, \"Modern Life in London, or Tom and Jerry Back Again,\"\r\nillustrated by Mr. Priestman Atkinson--these formed the staple of his\r\n_Punch_ work. But he was not enthusiastic about writing for the paper,\r\nas the chance of gaining reputation by unsigned contributions was very\r\nsmall. \"I feel strongly,\" he wrote to me years ago, \"as many writers do\r\non the paper, as to the inequality of authors and artists. It keeps very\r\ngood men off it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Berkeley Square, 5 p.m.\" was a poem of five stanzas that formed\r\nFrederick Locker-Lampson's sole contribution to _Punch_; it was\r\npublished at the same time as Savile Clarke's maiden effort (August,\r\n1867), and was illustrated by Mr. du Maurier. It was Locker-Lampson, it\r\nmay here be mentioned, who sent in C. S. Calverley's ewe-lamb--a\r\ncharade--to _Punch's_ pages.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of July, 1868, a lady-contributor made her début in\r\n_Punch's_ pages. This was Miss M. Betham-Edwards, who was already well\r\nknown as the authoress of \"A Winter with the Swallows,\" and whose travel\r\n\"Through Spain to the Sahara,\" dealing with much the same scene, was\r\nthen expected from the press. In the earlier part of the year a friend\r\nhad shown to Mark Lemon a clever skit by the young lady, and the Editor\r\nforthwith commissioned her to write a series of papers to be called\r\n\"Mrs. Punch's Letters to her Daughter\"--a sort of belated sequel to\r\nJerrold's \"Punch's Letters to his Son.\" These letters, which ran through\r\nsix numbers--the last in November 7th of the same year--are\r\ncontributions of the worldly-wise order, cynical, satirical, and shrewd.\r\nTwo years later Mark Lemon died, and Miss Betham-Edwards dropped out of\r\nthe outside Staff position which she was by courtesy supposed to occupy.\r\nCertain contributions she sent in were returned; she took the hint, and\r\nthe connection was severed.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Mr. du Maurier wrote his admirable \"Vers\r\nNonsensiques,\" and proved the literary talent which he afterwards\r\ndisplayed in so striking a manner in his lecture on \"Social Satire\" and\r\nin his novels. But, as has already been pointed out in several other\r\ncases, he is not by any means alone in having used both pen and pencil\r\nin the paper. Thackeray is the principal example of the twin-talent; but\r\nothers, in very various degrees, are Cuthbert Bede, Watts Phillips,\r\nThomas Hood (a single cut, and a wonderful one, too), Richard Doyle (a\r\nsingle contribution), John MacGregor, with Sir John Tenniel, and Messrs.\r\nAlfred Thompson, Ashby-Sterry, W. S. Gilbert, W. Ralston (one literary\r\neffort), J. Priestman Atkinson, J. H. Roberts (one poem), Harry Furniss\r\n(a dramatic criticism), and Arthur A. Sykes. As a rule, however, artist\r\nand author has kept strictly within his own field, although a bold\r\nexperiment of a curious kind was once proposed. On that occasion the\r\nliterary Staff had been complaining, with malicious frankness,\r\nthat the drawings in a certain issue--(it is not necessary to\r\nparticularise)--were not up to the mark. They were at once challenged by\r\nthe artists, who declared that they would strike--that _they_ would do\r\nthe text, and allow the literary men to do the pictures. The idea was\r\nseized upon; the result, they thought, would be screamingly funny. But\r\nthe Editor would not hear of it; he imagined, not without reason, that\r\nthe public, who would be called upon (but would probably decline) to\r\npay, would not see the point of the joke. Years after a similar\r\ndiscussion arose; and those who heard it are not likely to forget the\r\nmock-philosophic-gastronomic blank verse composed by Mr. Sambourne on\r\nthe spur of the moment just to illustrate how very easy clever\r\nverse-writing really is.\r\n\r\nWhilst _Punch_ has been greatly indebted for much of its humour to\r\nScotsmen, several Irishmen also have contributed not a little to its\r\nsuccess. Mr. Alfred Perceval Graves is one of these, although it is long\r\nsince he wrote for the paper. \"I contributed to _Punch_\" he says,\r\n\"during Shirley Brooks's editorship. Tom Taylor was then secretary to\r\nthe Local Government Board, and I was private secretary to the\r\nParliamentary Under Secretary for the Home Office, Mr. Winterbotham.\r\nMeeting on business, we struck up a friendly acquaintance, and, _Punch_\r\nbeing then a close borough, Taylor smuggled in verses and jokes of mine\r\nfor a while, till he thought I had established a claim to introduction\r\nto Shirley Brooks. My work only went on from 1871 to 1874, as I became\r\nso engaged on literary work of a severer kind, and educational work as\r\nan Inspector of Schools, that I had not time for _Punch_; and when I\r\ncared to return to it Taylor had gone, and the present Editor was\r\nsurrounded by fresh men, so I have not resumed my connection with it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graves--the author of the popular \"Father O'Flynn,\" perhaps the best\r\nof all his Irish songs--wrote for _Punch_ \"The Tea-Table Tragedy,\" \"The\r\nBallad of the Babes in the Wood,\" and those admirable \"Lines of Farewell\r\nto the Irish Humorist, Baron Dowse, on leaving the House of Commons\"--\r\n\r\n  \"Dick Dowse, Dick Dowse,\r\n  Is it lavin' the House?\"\r\n\r\nThen there is \"On St. Patrick's Day falling on a Sunday,\" and in\r\n_Punch's_ Pocket-Book the lines on \"A Frog,\" and \"A Cauliflower\"--a\r\nparody of \"The green, immortal Shamrock.\" But another merit in Mr.\r\nGraves was his coaching of Charles Keene on the subject of his Irish\r\njokes, for which the former was greatly responsible in the years of his\r\n_Punch_ connection.\r\n\r\nNursery jingles newly adapted and applied to the morals and manners of\r\nthe day are always a favourite vehicle of satire with the public, and\r\nhave been freely used by professional humorists. _Punch_ offers many\r\ninstances of happy examples of the work. The first of a long series of\r\n\"Nursery Rhymes for the Times\" was begun by Mr. Charles Smith Cheltnam\r\non January 9th, 1875, as well as in the Almanac of the same year. The\r\nwriter forthwith became a busy contributor. About fifty of these rhymes\r\nappeared in _Punch_ in quick succession, and there were many other\r\npieces besides. \"The Infallible Truth,\" a comment in verse on the\r\npassage at arms which was then (November 13th, 1875) taking place\r\nbetween Lord Redesdale and Dr. Manning on the subject of infallibility,\r\nshowed that _Punch's_ \"papal aggression\" was still rankling in his\r\nbosom. Mr. Cheltnam remained a contributor until the death of Tom\r\nTaylor, when he transferred his pen to the service of \"Fun.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 1st, 1872, the Rev. F. D. Maurice died, and _Punch_ contained a\r\nset of verses to his memory, in which the beauty and the strength of his\r\ncharacter were set forth with deep sympathy, and not without power or\r\npoetical thought. They were from the hand of the Rev. Stainton Moses, of\r\nExeter College, Oxford, for seventeen years an assistant master at the\r\nUniversity College School. He was the editor of the leading London organ\r\nof Spiritualism. The more ribald of his pupils and acquaintance declared\r\nthat his spiritualism was of another sort; but there is no doubt that he\r\nwas very popular with all men, and exercised great influence among the\r\nfaithful.\r\n\r\nEighteen years after the death of Gilbert Abbott à Beckett, his son,\r\nArthur W. à Beckett, restored the family name to _Punch's_ Staff. He had\r\nbeen nominated to the War Office by Lord Palmerston, but he soon found\r\nthat he could walk in no other path but that which his father had\r\ntrodden. Like him, he became an editor at twenty, by assuming for a\r\nspace the direction, relinquished by Mr. F. C. Burnand, of an evening\r\npaper called the \"Glow-Worm\"--whose light, after Mr. à Beckett left it,\r\nsteadily refused to burn with the requisite effulgence. Mark Lemon was\r\nthen approached; but he would have nothing to say to--or, rather,\r\nnothing to do with--the sons of his old friend, who thereupon sought\r\nelsewhere the encouragement they had hoped for in _Punch's_ show. Mr.\r\nArthur à Beckett started a satirico-humorous paper of great ability and\r\npromise, the staff including himself and his brother, Matt Morgan,\r\nFrederick Clay, and Frank Marshall, with Messrs. Alfred Thompson,\r\nAustin, T. G. Bowles, and T. H. Escott--most of them Civil Servants. But\r\nin the full tide of its success its financial foundations were weakened\r\nby one in the managerial department, and the whole thing came to the\r\nground. After a few years of an active journalistic career he was\r\ninvited by Tom Taylor, who had succeeded to the command, to contribute\r\nto _Punch_. A curious success attended his opening chapters. His first\r\npaper on a \"Public Office\" (p. 226, Vol. LXVI.), as well as the twelve\r\nfollowing--that is to say, his contributions to thirteen consecutive\r\nnumbers--were all of them quoted in the \"Times,\" though whether or not\r\nthrough Taylor's intermediary did not appear. After the fourth number\r\nMr. à Beckett was put on the salaried Staff, and in August, 1875, was\r\ninvited to join the Table. Since Mr. Burnand's promotion to the\r\neditorship Mr. à Beckett has acted as his _locum tenens_, just as\r\nShirley Brooks did to Lemon, and Percival Leigh to Brooks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARTHUR À BECKETT.\r\n(_From a Photograph by A. Bassano, Limited._)]\r\n\r\nBeing called to the Bar in 1881, Mr. à Beckett was enabled to revive the\r\nhumours of his father's \"Mr. Briefless,\" by the filial creation of the\r\nhappily-named \"A. BRIEFLESS, Junior.\" The \"Papers from Pump Handle\r\nCourt\" from this self-sufficient, inflated, and utterly hopeless Junior,\r\nhave been a feature in _Punch_ for years past, and by them the author\r\nhas--so says an expert--\"charmingly illuminated the legal profession by\r\nhis queer fancy.\" One of the best papers in the collection is an account\r\nof a visit to the studio of a well-known firm of West-End photographers\r\nin the character of a legal celebrity, which is wittily called \"A Matter\r\nin Camera.\" Up to December, 1894, he had contributed to a thousand and\r\neighty consecutive numbers, his work including many \"series,\" besides\r\nthe usual topical subject-articles.\r\n\r\nMortimer Collins became an occasional, and by no means a prolific,\r\ncontributor of verse from the year 1874. The sonnet in _Punch_ on p.\r\n237, Vol. XI. (December, 1846), has been ascribed to him, but there is\r\nno ground for the statement (he would then have been only nineteen years\r\nof age), nor did he contribute otherwise than from 1874 to 1876. His\r\nlight lyric touch may be traced in many a poem. In \"Where shall we go?\"\r\n(p. 105, Vol. LXIX., September 11th, 1875) his dainty pen is to be\r\nrecognised; as in \"Lady Psyche's Garden Party,\" and various other verses\r\nof similar style and pleasant flavour. The attack on Mr. Whalley and\r\n\"Crede Byron\" (July 20th, 1875) are his, and the verses on the Burnham\r\nBeeches, and, in September, \"Causidicus ad Canem.\" The charming \"Sonnets\r\nfor the Sex\" (June 17th, 1876) and, on July 8th, the humorous prose in\r\npraise of goose-quill and sealing-wax, entitled \"Mr. Oldfangle's\r\nOpinion,\" were full of pleasing turns of thought--little presaging the\r\nwriter's death three weeks later. When he died, _Punch_ contained an\r\nobituary notice of the writer (p. 57, Vol. LXXI., August 12th, 1876), in\r\nwhich it is said, \"He wrote the 'Secret of Long Life,' to teach men to\r\nlive a century, and himself died at forty-nine.\" He was in this respect\r\na curious echo of Thomas Walker, who wrote his \"Art of Attaining High\r\nHealth\" in his paper \"The Original,\" and did not survive the completion\r\nof his task; and the prototype of the Duke of Marlborough, who died\r\nwhile engaged on an essay on the \"Art of Living\" for the \"Nineteenth\r\nCentury.\" Had he lived, he would certainly have been promoted to the\r\nStaff; and the fact that his funeral was officially attended by Tom\r\nTaylor, Percival Leigh, and Mr. Arthur à Beckett, on behalf of _Punch_,\r\nis testimony of the respect in which his co-operation was held.\r\n\r\nThe literary post on _Punch_ which corresponds with that of Chief\r\nCartoonist has for years past been occupied by Mr. Edwin J. Milliken.\r\nThe position is an onerous one, and carries great responsibility with\r\nit. He who fills it is at once \"the _Punch_ Poet\" _par excellence_ and\r\nthe big drum, so to speak, of the political orchestra. For many years\r\nMr. Milliken has written the letterpress explanatory of the Cartoon,\r\neither in verse or prose, as well as the preface to each succeeding\r\nvolume. To his pen, too, we have owed during the same period those\r\nverses which it has been the graceful practice of _Punch_ to devote to\r\nthe memory of distinguished men. Remarkable for their tact, dignity, and\r\ngood-sense--instinct with lofty thought and deep feeling--these poems\r\nare often masterpieces of their kind, models of taste and generous\r\nsympathy. In particular, those published upon the deaths of Lord\r\nBeaconsfield, John Bright, and Lord Tennyson, may be remembered as\r\nworthy of the men they were designed to honour, as well as for the\r\nfelicity with which they set down what was in the heart of the nation,\r\nand the eloquence with which its sentiment was expressed.\r\n\r\nOn January 2nd, 1875, there appeared in _Punch_ some lines entitled \"A\r\nVoice from Venus,\" the planet's transit having at that time just\r\noccurred. They were Mr. Milliken's first contribution--a bow drawn at a\r\nventure--for he was entirely unknown to anyone connected with the paper.\r\nTom Taylor asked for a guarantee of the originality of the verses--in\r\nitself a flattering distrust--and, receiving the necessary assurance,\r\nprinted them forthwith. From that time forward the young writer\r\ncontributed with regularity, and for two years was put severely through\r\nhis paces by the Editor, who, in order to \"try his hand,\" as he said,\r\ngave him every sort of work to do. Then came a personal interview of a\r\ngratulatory nature, in which Taylor promised to invite Mr. Milliken to\r\nthe Table as soon as a vacancy occurred. At the end of the second year\r\nof probation this promise was fulfilled, and early in 1877 \"E. J. M.\"\r\ncut his initials on the board.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that the successful career of Mr. Milliken is in\r\ndirect opposition to his training, for he began life, much against his\r\nwill, as a man of business in a great engineering firm. But literature\r\nwas his goal, and the appreciation of the editors of a few magazines and\r\njournals to some extent satisfied his ambition. In point of fact, Mr.\r\nMilliken, in respect to his work, is the most modest and retiring of\r\nmen; and the only contribution to which his name appeared, for years\r\nbefore or after, was the set of memorial verses to Charles Dickens which\r\nwere printed in the \"Gentleman's Magazine\" in 1870.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E. J. MILLIKEN.\r\n(_From a Photograph by Messrs. Bassano._)]\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt \"The 'Arry Papers\" are the most popular and best known\r\nof Mr. Milliken's contributions, although \"Childe Chappie's Pilgrimage,\"\r\n\"The Modern Ars Amandi\" (1883), \"The Town\" (1884), \"Fitzdotterel; or,\r\nT'other and Which\" (a parody of Lord Lytton's \"Glenaveril\"), 1885;\r\n\"Untiled; or, the Modern Asmodeus\" (1889-90), and \"The New Guide to\r\nKnowledge,\" have successively loomed large in _Punch's_ firmament. But\r\nit is the great creation of 'Arry for which Mr. Milliken is most\r\napplauded--and least understood. It is generally supposed that the 'Arry\r\nof Mr. Milliken corresponds to the similar character conceived by\r\nCharles Keene and Mr. Anstey. But the author means him for a great deal\r\nmore. 'Arry with him is not so much a personage as a type--as much an\r\nimpersonal symbol as Mr. Watts's Love, or Death, or other quality,\r\npassion, or fate, without individuality and, in spirit at least, without\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nIt is often suggested that Mr. Milliken's 'Arry is the survival--or, at\r\nleast, the descendant--of the \"gent\" of Leech and the \"snob\" of\r\nThackeray and Albert Smith. He is nothing of the sort. The gent and the\r\nsnob had at least this merit; they aspired, or imagined themselves, to\r\nbe something more and better than they really were. But 'Arry is a\r\nself-declared cad, without either hope or desire, or even thought, of\r\nredemption. Self-sufficient, brazen, and unblushing in his irrepressible\r\nvulgarity, blatant and unashamed, he is distinguished by a sort of\r\ngood-humour that is as rampant and as offensive as his swaggering\r\nselfishness, his arrogant familiarity and effrontery, and his sensuous\r\nsentiment. He is a mean-souled and cynical camp-follower of the army of\r\nKing Demos, every day expanding, every day more objectionable in his\r\ninsolent assurance. Originally designed as an illustration of the\r\n'Arryism of the rougher classes, then promoted to be characteristic of\r\nthe low sort of shop-lad and still lower kind of mechanic \"with views\"\r\nof a clear-cut kind within the narrow limits of his materialistic\r\nphilosophy, he has developed into a type of character--almost, indeed,\r\ninto a type of humanity. And as 'Arryism is rife in every walk of\r\nsociety, so 'Arry's experiences have become more informed, but not for\r\nthat reason more cultivated or more refined. And therein lies the one\r\ninevitably weak point of Mr. Milliken's invention. Like Frankenstein, he\r\nseems to have created a Monster, who has outgrown the purpose he was\r\noriginally intended to serve. For when he finds himself considering the\r\n'Arryism of the \"upper classes,\" he is bound, by his otherwise admirable\r\nconvention, to retain the Cockney slang of which he is such a master,\r\neven though the speaker is supposed to have advanced so far in his views\r\nand knowledge of life as to be able to discuss matters of art, science,\r\nand literature. For, be it observed, a bank-'oliday at the Welsh 'Arp,\r\n\"wich is down 'Endon wy,\" is no longer a spree for him, however\r\nuproarious the \"shindy,\" and however ready his \"gal\" may be to sit on\r\nhis knee and \"change 'ats\" to the accompaniment of cornet and\r\nconcertina. He travels--on the cheap, of course--but still he travels,\r\nand discusses Venus of Milo, and 'Igh Art, and the philosophic questions\r\nof the \"dy,\" and resolves all his meditations into the \"motter\" that\r\n\"Socierty's all right.\" Without soul, without ideality, without\r\naspiration, save of the baser sort, he represents no good quality nor\r\nredeeming virtue but physical health--the promise, it may at least be\r\nhoped, of a posterity that in the future, perchance, may justify his\r\nexistence. He is the raw, the offensively raw, material from which\r\nrespectable and useful descendants may eventually be made. At present\r\nMr. Milliken shows the 'Arryism that is permeating and fouling all\r\nclasses, almost to the highest; but there the convention fails--only\r\nbecause it _is_ a convention--for 'Arry is made to fill the part which\r\nhas more recently, and perhaps with greater fitness, been accorded to\r\nthe Bounder.[46]\r\n\r\nBut, apart from the satirical creation, 'Arry is a most amusing\r\npersonage--his forms of speech, the quaint turns of his vulgar thought,\r\nbeing in themselves irresistibly laughable--their grossness merged in\r\ntheir genuine humour, and in the art so well concealed. 'Arry alone has\r\nstamped Mr. Milliken as a satirical humorist of the front rank, and has\r\ngone far towards making the public forget his other phase--the graceful\r\nand sympathetic poet. The philologists, too, proclaim their debt of\r\ngratitude to the author as the most complete collector of modern English\r\nslang, with suitable context and situation. Dr. Murray's great \"New\r\nEnglish Dictionary\" accepts 'Arry as a name \"used humorously for: A\r\nlow-bred fellow (who drops his _h's_) of lively temper and manners,\"\r\nand quotes \"'Arry on 'Orseback\" in _Punch's_ Almanac for 1874 as his\r\ndébut in print. And, finally, Herr C. Stoffel, of Nijmegen, has\r\npublished a philological volume on the \"'Arry Letters\" in _Punch_, from\r\n1883 to 1889, examining the cant words with the utmost elaboration,\r\ngravity, and knowledge, and producing one of the most valuable treatises\r\non the subject that have hitherto been published.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the work already indicated, Mr. Milliken (as shown in the\r\nchapter on cartoons) devotes a great deal of attention to the devising\r\nof Mr. Punch's \"big cuts,\" both for Sir John Tenniel and Mr. Linley\r\nSambourne. The Almanac double-page cartoons, too--usually very elaborate\r\ndesigns--have been planned by him for a good many years, as well as most\r\nof Mr. Sambourne's fanciful calendars and \"months\" in the Almanacs. It\r\nwill thus be seen that--with all his work in prose and verse, from a\r\nparagraph to a preface, and from a series to an epigram--Mr. Milliken is\r\nWriter-of-all-work and \"General Utility\" in the best sense; and a more\r\nloyal and devoted servant _Punch_ has never had.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GILBERT À BECKETT\r\n(_From a Photograph by Messrs. Bassano._)]\r\n\r\nAlfred Thompson's work, which began in 1876, is considered with that of\r\n_Punch's_ artists. Then came Gilbert Arthur à Beckett, who after a short\r\nspell of regular work was summoned to the Table. His first contribution\r\nhad, in fact, been published by Mark Lemon, but immediately afterwards\r\nthat Editor treated him just as he had treated his brother; and not for\r\nsome years did he receive the call. Tom Taylor it was who, attracted by\r\nthe quality of the work which the brothers were doing elsewhere, sent\r\nthe coveted invitation.[47] In 1879--five years after his brother\r\nArthur--Gilbert à Beckett joined the salaried Staff, and three years\r\nlater he was appointed to the Table. He had a very quaint humour and a\r\nwonderfully quick and startling sense of the incongruous. He was sadly\r\nhampered by his affliction, but he was an accomplished, high-principled,\r\nsensitive fellow, of whom one of his companions declared that \"he was\r\nthe purest-minded man I ever knew.\" Under more favourable conditions of\r\nhealth he would probably have made a greater mark; but as it was, he did\r\ngood work. He was a happy parodist, and a very neat and smart\r\nversifier--at the age of fifteen he had gained the prize for English\r\nverse at Westminster, which was open to the whole school--and in the\r\nwildly absurd yet laughable vein of his bogus advertisements (of which\r\nhe did many under the head of \"How we Advertise Now\"--a continuation of\r\nJerrold's early idea) none of his _Punch_ brethren could touch him. He\r\nwas, perhaps, best known to the world as part author of the famous\r\npolitical burlesque of \"The Happy Land;\" less, perhaps, as part author\r\nof \"The White Pilgrim;\" and least of all as a musical composer, as it\r\nwas under the pseudonym of \"Vivian Bligh\" that he put forth his songs\r\nand his music for the \"German Reeds' Entertainment.\" But his work on\r\n_Punch_ was always relished, and, considering his sad physical\r\nafflictions, he held his own on the Staff. He contributed both prose and\r\nverse, smart and apt of their kind. He wrote--in part, at least--the\r\nadmirable parody of a boy's sensational shocker (p. 119, Vol. LXXXII.,\r\nMarch 11th, 1882). With the exception of this and the comical\r\n\"Advertisements\" he did very few \"series,\" but his contributions were\r\nalways varied and excellent in their way, and himself appreciated as a\r\nuseful and clever man. Perhaps his chief claim to recollection was his\r\nsuggestion, as explained elsewhere, of the famous cartoon of \"Dropping\r\nthe Pilot.\" The Dinners were his greatest pleasure, and he attended them\r\nwith regularity, although the paralysis of the legs--the result of\r\nfalling down the stairway of Gower Street Station--from which he\r\nsuffered (in common with his uncle Sir William à Beckett, and with one\r\nof the Mayhew brothers as well) rendered his locomotion and the\r\nmounting of Mr. Punch's stairway a matter of painful exertion. Although\r\nhe did useful work for _Punch_, he never became a known popular\r\nfavourite; yet when he died--on October 15th, 1891--a chorus of\r\nunanimous regret arose in the press, for he was one of those few men who\r\ncount none but friends among their wide circle of acquaintance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Punch's\" Family Trees.\r\n(NOTE.--The names of the workers for _Punch_ are printed in capitals.)]\r\n\r\nMr. Horace Frank Lester, late of Oxford University, afterwards\r\nbarrister-at-law, author and journalist of the first rank, but at that\r\ntime unknown to _Punch_, first appeared on January 5th, 1878, with a\r\nslashing satire on busybody amateur statesmen which greatly tickled Tom\r\nTaylor's fancy. But his first real hit was in September, 1880, with a\r\nform of contribution then comparatively new. It was a \"Diary of the\r\nPremier at Sea,\" when Mr. Gladstone was on board the _Grantully Castle_,\r\nand, so far from \"husbanding his energies,\" as his doctor directed, was\r\nsupposed to receive deputations, make speeches, convert the\r\nman-at-the-wheel from Toryism, and try to cut down the mainmast with his\r\naxe. Then followed political diaries, parodies (such as \"'The Entire\r\nHistory of Our Own Times' by Jestin Machearty,\" and innumerable poems),\r\ncomic Latin verse, \"Journal of a Rolling Stone,\" \"Advice Gratis,\" \"Queer\r\nQueries,\" legal skits, and so on. An amusing incident occurred in\r\nrespect to one of the \"Advice Gratis\" series. Mr. Lester had spoken of a\r\nmythical book called \"Etiquette for the Million: or, How to Behave Like\r\na Gentleman on Nothing a Year, _published at this Office_.\" A corporal\r\nstationed at Galway Barracks wrote and asked for the price of it, \"as I\r\nam extremely anxious to have the book referred to.\" Mr. Burnand's reply\r\nwas simply, \"_Sold_.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44] Lord Ellenborough.\r\n\r\n[45] See p. 85.\r\n\r\n[46] I have been fortunate in ascertaining Mr. Milliken's own estimate\r\nof 'Arry in a private letter to a friend. Although it was not written\r\nfor publication, I have received permission to quote the following\r\nsentences:--\r\n\r\n\"'Arry--as you say--the essential _Cad_, is really appalling. He is not\r\na creature to be laughed at or with. My main purpose was satirical--an\r\nanalysis of and an attack on the _spirit of Caddishness_, rampant in our\r\ndays in many grades of life, coarse, corrupting, revolting in all. I\r\nmight have confined myself to the 'Humours of 'Arry,' when my work would\r\nhave been more genial, and, to many, more attractive. But then I should\r\nhave missed my mark. On the other hand, I might have made it a more\r\nrealistic study, but then I should have got very few readers, and\r\ncertainly no place in the _Punch_ pages. So it was a compromise; not a\r\nconsistent study of an individual Cad, but of the various\r\ncharacteristics of Caddishness. It has been said that an ordinary cad\r\ncould not have done or said or known all that my 'Arry did. Quite true,\r\nquite well known to me while writing; and indeed I forestalled the\r\nobjection in the preface of the book.... As to 'Arry's origin, and the\r\nway in which I studied him, I have mingled much with working men,\r\nshop-lads, and would-be smart and 'snide' clerks--who plume themselves\r\non their mastery of slang and their general 'cuteness' and 'leariness.' I\r\nhave watched, listened, and studied for years 'from the life,' and I\r\nfancy I've a good memory for slang phrases of all sorts; and my 'Arry\r\n'slang,' as I have said, is very varied, and not scientific, though most\r\nof it I have _heard_ from the lips of street-boy, Bank-holiday youth,\r\ncoster, cheap clerk, counter-jumper, bar-lounger, cheap excursionist,\r\nsmoking-concert devotee, tenth-rate suburban singer, music hall 'pro' or\r\nhis admirer,\" etc. etc.\r\n\r\n[47] Connection with _Punch_ has run strangely in families--as the\r\nreader may see by reference to the \"Family Trees\" on the next page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n_PUNCH'S_ WRITERS: 1880-94.\r\n\r\n     \"Robert\"--Mr. Deputy Bedford--Mr. Ashby-Sterry--Reginald Shirley\r\n     Brooks--Mr. George Augustus Sala--Mr. Clement Scott--The \"Times\"\r\n     Approves--Mr. H.

Stoneham._)]\r\n\r\n\"Robert, the City waiter\" made his low-comedy bow in 1880. \"Robert's\"\r\nliterary father is Mr. Deputy John T. Bedford, whose opportunities for\r\nstudying the ways of the City waiter have necessarily been many and\r\nexcellent. The result of his keen observation was introduced to _Punch_\r\nthrough chance. \"My introduction to _Punch_,\" Mr. Bedford informs me,\r\n\"arose from the quite accidental circumstance that Mr. Burnand and\r\nmyself were introduced at the same time, by Mr. F. Gordon, on the\r\ndirectorship of the 'Grand Hotel' at Charing Cross; and very shortly\r\nafterwards ... on the appointment of Mr. Burnand as Mr. Tom Taylor's\r\nsuccessor, I ventured to congratulate him, when he said to me, 'If any\r\nfun is to be found in the City, I shall expect you to bring it to me.' I\r\nreplied that I had sometimes thought that there was some to be got out\r\nof a City waiter, as waiters were not quite so deaf as was generally\r\nconsidered. I tried my hand, and my first attempt was very kindly\r\nreceived; it was printed on p. 64, Vol. LXXIX. (August 14th, 1880),\r\nunder the title of 'Notes from the Diary of a City Waiter.' ... There is\r\nno truth in the statement that Robert was based upon a certain waiter.\r\nHe is certainly imaginary\"--a statement which disposes of the assertion\r\nthat the famous old \"Cock Tavern\" is famous nowadays for the original of\r\n\"Robert\" in the person of its head-waiter. Since 1880 Mr. Deputy Bedford\r\nis to be credited with more than two hundred contributions, of which,\r\nhowever, only a proportion belong to the \"Robert\" series. \"You will find\r\nsome of them,\" writes Mr. Bedford, \"signed J. Litgué, a _nom de plume_\r\nthat puzzled Mr. Burnand himself, until I revealed the secret that it\r\nwas French for 'Bed-ford'; and he, with his excellent knowledge of\r\nFrench, was thoroughly sold.\" \"Robert\" has been republished in book\r\nform, and has attained an extraordinary circulation, though some of Mr.\r\nBedford's critics have declared that the chief attraction has been the\r\nadmirable illustrations by Charles Keene with which the little book is\r\nembellished. For severe critics there are; one of whom, in order to\r\nprove that \"Robert\" was not a humorous creation at all, took the curious\r\ncourse of translating one of his articles into good, well-spelt English,\r\nand then triumphantly asking--\"Where is the humour now?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. ASHBY-STERRY\r\n(_From a Photograph by Samuel A. Walker._)]\r\n\r\nA complete contrast to Mr. Bedford became a contributor to _Punch_ a\r\nfortnight after him--Mr. J. Ashby-Sterry. Twenty-nine years had passed\r\nsince his boyish drawings had been accepted; and during the interval he\r\nhad relinquished the pencil for the pen, had become a well-known\r\njournalist, and the author of sundry volumes of light literature. He was\r\none of the first to be summoned by the new Editor, and he responded\r\nnobly to the call. Since August 28th, 1880, he has contributed as\r\nlargely as any outsider to _Punch's_ pages. Innumerable picture-shows,\r\nnew books, articles of all kinds, and countless verses of every\r\ndescription on every possible topic, with paragraphs long and short,\r\nare, so to speak, the _hors d'oeuvres_ of his contribution. Many\r\nseries of poems and papers are his, of which the best-known is that of\r\nthe \"Lays of a Lazy Minstrel\" (begun August 28th, 1880), with their\r\nriverside idylls and love-carols; but to his hand also are to be\r\ncredited \"Simple Stories for Little Gentlefolk,\" \"Holiday Haunts, by\r\nJingle Junior on the Jaunt,\" \"Club Carols,\" \"Uncle Bulger's Moral\r\nTales,\" \"Songs of the Streets,\" \"Rambling Rondeaux,\" and \"Paper-knife\r\nPoems.\" But it is his fluent, melodious, and unpretentious verse that\r\nhas made him popular in _Punch_.\r\n\r\nReginald Shirley Brooks, the son of Mr. Burnand's brilliant predecessor,\r\nwas working for _Punch_ in 1880, and the following year he was called to\r\nthe Table, and remained there without much distinction until 1884. He\r\nwrote some smart papers, but his groove was not that of the sober and\r\nrespectable Fleet Street Sage. He preferred wilder spirits, and he\r\naccordingly retired, taking with him the sympathy of his companions. He\r\ndied soon after.\r\n\r\nAfter the escapade of Mr. George Augustus Sala in respect to Alfred\r\nBunn's quarrel with _Punch_ and the resultant \"Word with Punch\" of half\r\na century ago (which was illustrated by Mr. Sala's lively pencil, as is\r\nexplained in another chapter), none would ever have thought that his pen\r\nwould have been driven in _Punch's_ service. Lemon had declared him a\r\n\"graceless young whelp,\" and nothing that Mr. Sala ever cared to do had\r\ntended to change that opinion. Shirley Brooks and Tom Taylor carried on\r\nthe sentiment as a sort of dynastic vendetta, and Mr. Sala's name was\r\nkept on _Punch's_ Index Expurgatorius until the accession of Mr.\r\nBurnand. _Punch_ was then no longer the close borough, and the new\r\nEditor sought talent where he could find it. He invited Mr. Sala to\r\ncontribute, and the invitation has been responded to whenever anything\r\n\"Punchy\" has occurred to the writer--as in the rhymed travesty of\r\nTennyson's opening verses of \"The Princess.\" It is an amusing fact that\r\non one occasion Mr. Sala contributed a skit on himself--felicitously\r\nentitled \"_Egos_ of the Week\"--with the startling and satisfactory\r\nresult that one or two papers, taking the thing _au sérieux_, commented\r\non the fact, and expressed their pleasure that \"at last Mr. George\r\nAugustus Sala has had the drubbing by _Punch_ he has so long and so\r\nrichly deserved\"!\r\n\r\nMr. Clement Scott, the _doyen_ of the dramatic critics, Civil Servant\r\n(like so many of the _Punch_ Staff), member of the clever band that\r\nnurtured \"Fun\" into life, and brother-in-law of Mr. du Maurier, also had\r\nto wait till Mr. Burnand was Editor before he was given the opportunity\r\nto write for _Punch_. \"It struck him,\" writes Mr. Scott, \"that he might\r\nmingle among the essentially comic pages an occasional poem that might\r\nventilate some grievance in a pathetic manner or describe some heroic\r\nsubject in the ballad style.... The first subject Burnand sent me was\r\nthe overworked and underpaid clerks in London. It took my fancy, and in\r\nthree hours after I received his letter I sent him 'The Cry of the\r\nClerk!' To my intense surprise, the morning after it appeared in _Punch_\r\nI found it quoted _in extenso_ in 'The Times'--an unusual honour. I\r\nbelieve Dr. Chinery the instant he read the poem clipped it out with his\r\nown scissors and said, 'I don't know if this has ever been done before,\r\nbut we must quote the poem to-morrow morning.' The sub-editor was\r\naghast, but the poem was printed as from _Punch_.\"\r\n\r\nThese verses, indeed, struck people's consciences, as Thomas Hood had\r\nstruck them years ago with \"The Song of the Shirt.\" It brought into\r\nrelief the enforced \"respectability\" of the men who earn but a few\r\nshillings a week, and yet are supposed to be \"above charity.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the last verse that most struck home:--\r\n\r\n \"Why did I marry? In mercy's name, in the form of my brother was I not\r\n    born?\r\n  Are wife and child to be given to him, and love to be taken from me\r\n    with scorn?\r\n  It is not for them that I plead, for theirs are the only voices that\r\n    break my sorrow,\r\n  That lighten my pathway, make me pause 'twixt the sad to-day and grim\r\n    to-morrow.\r\n  The Sun and the Sea are not given to me, nor joys like yours as you flit\r\n    together\r\n  Away to the woods and the downs, and across the endless acres of purple\r\n    heather.\r\n  But I've love, thank Heaven! and mercy, too; 'tis for justice only I bid\r\n    you hark\r\n  To the tale of a penniless man like me--to the wounded cry of a London\r\n    Clerk!\"\r\n\r\nThen he took the part of the shop-girls who are never allowed to sit\r\ndown (\"Weary Womankind\"); of the London children who cry for fresh air\r\n(\"The Children's Cry\"), and described as well many a deed of daring by\r\nsea and land, in which sailors, soldiers, engine-drivers, policemen,\r\nlife-boatmen, and coastguardsmen were concerned. In his little volume of\r\n\"Lays and Lyrics\" nearly a score of these _Punch_ poems are republished.\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary phase of _Punch_ is the one which has remained\r\nconstant from the beginning of the paper. All else has been subject to\r\nchange--the quality of its satire, the character of its literature, the\r\nintention of its art, and the class of its humour. But in his attendance\r\nupon Parliament _Punch_ has been persistently assiduous and consistently\r\nfrank, neither awed by its majesty nor sickened by its follies.\r\nParliament has always been regarded in his pages in the spirit of\r\nbenevolent patronage and control, which, though unquestionably\r\npedagogic, has always been just and sympathetic in tone. It was in order\r\nto continue the chain forged by Shirley Brooks and Tom Taylor in their\r\n\"Essence of Parliament,\" without the dropping of a link, that Mr.\r\nBurnand's first Staff appointment was made with a view to filling the\r\nplace that had been left vacant by Tom Taylor's death. His attention,\r\nlike that of many others, had long been attracted to the brilliant\r\nweekly articles in the \"Observer,\" entitled \"From the Cross\r\nBenches\"--papers that dealt with the week's Parliamentary proceedings\r\nwith singular cleverness, humour, and originality--and at the proper\r\nmoment he sought out the author of them, Mr. Henry W. Lucy, of the\r\n\"Daily News.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lucy had already graduated as the Pepys of Parliament; for he had\r\nbeen known in gallery and lobby of the House for the past ten years, and\r\nwas acting as chief of the Parliamentary Staff for his paper. He was,\r\ntherefore, considered particularly well-fitted for the new post on\r\n_Punch_, and he readily accepted the invitation. His first contribution\r\nwas a sort of prospectus of Toby's Diary, which was published on January\r\n8th, 1881. Thenceforward Mr. Lucy became known as \"Toby, M.P.;\" and when\r\na puzzled Member of Parliament, familiar with his face, would\r\noccasionally ask him in the Lobby, \"By the way, where are you member\r\nfor?\" he would answer \"_Barks_\" and pass on. It is not uncommon to find\r\nunregenerate members taking to themselves the credit of the witticisms\r\nwhich Toby puts into their mouths; so that there is perhaps excuse for\r\nthe biographer of Lord Sherbrooke (Robert Lowe), who attributed to his\r\nsubject the capital exclamation with which Mr. Lucy endowed him. When he\r\nsaw a deaf member get his ear-trumpet into position in order to listen\r\nto a tedious orator, he remarked (according to Toby): \"What a pity it is\r\nto see a man thus wasting his natural advantages!\" And Lowe has had the\r\ncredit of it ever since.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H. W. LUCY.\r\n(_From a Photograph by Walery, Limited._)]\r\n\r\nNo one in the House knows its members so well as Mr. Lucy; no one out of\r\nit is so well acquainted with its procedure; and when for a short time\r\nhe reluctantly filled the editorial chair of the \"Daily News,\" he was\r\nunhappy till he got back to Toby's \"kennel\" in the gallery of the House\r\nof Commons.\r\n\r\nBut the Essence of Parliament as distilled by \"Toby\" is by no means the\r\nonly, hardly even the most voluminous of Mr. Lucy's _Punch_ work. In the\r\nrecess he is a constant contributor as Mr. Burnand's deputy in the\r\ncharacter of _Punch's_ reviewer--\"The Baron de Book-Worms,\" through\r\nwhose personality \"My Baronite\" appears from time to time; while among\r\nhis serial articles have been \"The Letter-bag of Toby, M.P.,\" and the\r\nset of Interviews with Celebrities at Home, parodies of the \"World's\"\r\narticles, which delighted none so much as Edmund Yates himself.[48] Mr.\r\nLucy joined the Table on his return from Japan in 1884.\r\n\r\nBut it is as \"Toby\" that he has gained most of his popularity. He showed\r\nthe way about the House of Commons to Mr. Harry Furniss; and, up to the\r\nwithdrawal of the latter, his \"Diary\" was always illustrated by that\r\nartist. Later on Mr. Edward J. Reed took the place Mr. Furniss resigned,\r\nand the pair continue to set before the world their humorous\r\nversions--perversions, it would be hardly fair to say--of Parliamentary\r\nproceedings. Mr. Lucy's touch is light and original, imparting an\r\nappearance of interest and entertainment to the dullest debate, and of\r\nverisimilitude to the most doubtful statements. Yet the \"Diary\" is not\r\nwithout its value as a record, while it remains an amusing commentary\r\nupon the work of the Session, and an entirely inoffensive caricature of\r\nthe men and speeches with whom it deals.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, when the entertainer's platform was offering inducements\r\nsuperior to those of the stage, Mr. George Grossmith began a series of\r\nsketches in _Punch_, entitled \"Very Trying,\" the fourth article of which\r\ncontained a skit of Mr. Flowers, the Police Magistrate at Bow Street,\r\nunder the heading of \"The Good-humoured Magistrate,\" and another dealt\r\nwith Mr. Vaughan. Then came his funny musical sketches, with a few bars\r\nof absurd music sprinkled here and there in imitation of the London\r\nconcert books. A few songs he also contributed to the paper, \"The Duke\r\nof Seven Dials\" becoming \"popular even unto Hackney.\" Then, in\r\ncollaboration with his brother, Mr. Weedon Grossmith, he produced \"The\r\nDiary of a Nobody.\" It was a domestic record of considerable length,\r\nwhich dealt in an extremely earnest way with Mr. Samuel Porter, who\r\nlived in a small villa in Holloway, and had trouble with his drains, and\r\nwas sometimes late at the office, with similar circumstances of striking\r\ninterest and concern, which seemed to him to call for public notice. The\r\n\"Diary\" was afterwards republished in book form.\r\n\r\nThe light and dainty touch of Mr. Andrew Lang has not been denied to\r\n_Punch_. A number of trifles in verse appeared in 1883 and the two\r\nfollowing years, the most important of them being a sonnet to Colonel\r\nBurnaby--the one contribution, it may be said, that the author has\r\nthought well to republish. Some years later he produced the laughable\r\nseries \"The Confessions of a Duffer\"--papers so humorous that it is\r\ndifficult to accept Mr. Lang's disclaimer that \"a comic paper is a thing\r\nin which I have no freedom to write.\"\r\n\r\nBesides Mr. W. Ralston, with his single contribution of \"K.G.--Q.E.D.\"\r\n(November 22nd, 1884), Miss May Kendall was the chief comer of the year\r\n1885. This lady helps to make up _Punch's_ bevy of lady literary\r\ncontributors--Miss Betham-Edwards, Mrs. Frances Collins, Lady Campbell,\r\nMiss Burnand (an occasional reviewer, or \"Baronitess\"), Miss\r\nHollingshead, and Mrs. Leverson, being the others. She is one of the few\r\nlady humorists of any consequence in her day. Women, as a rule, are\r\nhumorists neither born nor made. Often enough they are wits, more\r\nfrequently satirists. They can make, we are told, but they cannot take,\r\na joke; at any rate, they are usually out of their element in the comic\r\narena. Moreover, as butts for the caricaturist they are unsatisfactory,\r\nfor in proportion as his efforts are successful, his sense of chivalry\r\nis outraged; and we have seen how Keene and others recoiled from the\r\nidea. Only on one occasion did Mr. Furniss make the attempt, and that\r\nindirectly and in a sense unintentionally--and the circumstance brought\r\na miniature storm about his ears. No woman has ever yet been a\r\ncaricaturist, in spite of the fact that her femininity befits her\r\npre-eminently for the part. That she has desisted is a mercy for which\r\nman may be devoutly thankful. At the present time the rule here laid\r\ndown as to lady humorists is proved by an exception in the person of\r\nMiss Murphy, a lady, it is said, of much beauty, who worked her way up\r\nfrom a subordinate position to the editorship of \"The Melbourne Punch,\"\r\na really comic production; but the unequal battle that would follow any\r\nextensive imitation of her example is altogether too painful to\r\ncontemplate.\r\n\r\nMiss Kendall's first poems, which were introduced to the notice of\r\n_Punch_ by Mr. Andrew Lang in sincere admiration of their cleverness,\r\nwere \"The Lay of the Ancient Trilobite,\" and \"Ballad of the\r\nIchthyosaurus,\" which were printed in the numbers for January 24th and\r\nFebruary 14th, 1885. It is Miss Kendall's peculiar talent that she is\r\nable to extract delicate humour out of the most unpromising subjects,\r\nand even in these lays, which together constituted her maiden effort,\r\nthe characteristic is clearly shown. One verse may serve as an example;\r\nit is from the poem which shows how the Ichthyosaurus aspires to a\r\nhigher life, and how the all-absorbent Ether remains in triumph after we\r\nhave played out our little parts to their puny end:--\r\n\r\n  \"And we, howsoever we hated,\r\n    And feared, or made love, or believed,\r\n  For all the opinions we stated,\r\n    The woes and the wars we achieved,\r\n  We too shall lie idle together--\r\n    In very uncritical case;\r\n  And no one will win--but the Ether\r\n    That fills circumambient space.\"\r\n\r\nQuaintly humorous ideas are spread among her score of contributions--and\r\ntenderness, too; but it is as a humorous versifier of refinement and\r\noriginality that she has appealed strongly to _Punch_ readers, although,\r\nas she herself says, \"it seemed very wonderful to be _in Punch_, which\r\nI had venerated from my youth up.\"\r\n\r\nThe single contribution of Mr. Brandon Thomas has a rather interesting\r\nstory. It was a patriotic song of a stirring sort, called \"Britannia's\r\nVolunteers,\" composed at a time--in 1885--when patriotism was thick in\r\nthe air. It was put to music by Mr. Alfred Allen; and two days after it\r\nwas written, Mr. Thomas was at the house of Mr. Woodall, M.P., and there\r\nhe sang the song. An old gentleman, who covered his mouth and chin with\r\nhis hand, sat in the front row, and levelled a piercing look at the\r\nsinger, listening with intense interest. During the second verse Mr.\r\nThomas, who was much affected by the gazer, sang straight at the aged\r\nowner of the wonderful eyes:--\r\n\r\n  \"They were no conscripts Marlbro' led,\r\n    But freemen--Volunteers,\r\n  A free-born race from fathers bred\r\n    That won for us Poictiers;\r\n  No conscript names were on the roll--\r\n    All heroes dead and gone--\r\n  That blazoned bright on Victory's scroll\r\n    The name of Wellington:\r\n  And Inkerman's immortal height\r\n    Will tell for many a day\r\n  How sternly sons of Freedom fight,\r\n    Let odds be what they may.\r\n  Thus Liberty scorns vain alarms,\r\n    And answers back with cheers!\r\n  _No conscript legions flogged to arms\r\n    Have yet flogged Volunteers!_\"\r\n\r\nThen the masking hand was removed, and the face of Mr. Gladstone was\r\nrevealed. The sight of him seemed to stimulate the singer, an\r\nenthusiastic Conservative, and as he gave forth the last verse, with\r\nsingular effect, his eyes so filled with tears that he could hardly see\r\nthe piano keys:--\r\n\r\n  \"They think to crush old England,\r\n    And take her mighty place!\r\n  When they wipe out from ev'ry land\r\n    The language of her race;\r\n  When Justice meekly sheathes her sword,\r\n    And Freemen ne'er make laws;\r\n  When Tyrants rule by force and fraud\r\n    And dead is Freedom's cause;\r\n  When Liberty shall see her home\r\n    Low levelled with the turf,\r\n  And watch each son in turn become\r\n    A tyrant-driven serf;\r\n  When Freedom's sacred name's forgot\r\n    Within the hearts of men--\r\n  They'll crush us to the earth, but not--\r\n    By Heav'n!--but not till then!\"\r\n\r\nWhen it was finished, Mr. Gladstone applauded vigorously, as though\r\nunconscious of the pointed way in which the verse had been sung at him,\r\nor respectful perhaps of the sincerity of the singer; and Mr. Burnand,\r\nwho was present, and had been watching the scene with much amusement,\r\nenquired, aside, \"Who wrote that?\" \"I did.\" \"When?\" \"Two days ago.\"\r\n\"Have you sent it anywhere?\" \"No.\" \"Then let me have it.\" So with the\r\nmetre slightly changed it appeared in _Punch_ on May 23rd.\r\n\r\nSome of the most delicate and humorous _vers de société_ of the day have\r\ncome from Mr. Warham St. Leger, and some of the best have appeared since\r\nthe end of 1886 in the pages of _Punch_. \"The Lay of the Lost Critic\"\r\nwas the first of his contributions, and it was sent in, not by its\r\nauthor, but by a friend who had read it. So well was it thought of that\r\nMr. St. Leger was invited at once to become a contributor, and\r\naccordingly he sent in many poems during the four years that followed,\r\ntogether with odd papers in the form of letters, especially on\r\npseudo-scientific lines. All these poems were collected into a volume\r\nentitled \"Ballads from _Punch_\" in which perhaps the most striking are\r\nthat \"To my Hairdresser,\" and the irresistibly comic satire on modern\r\nordnance, in which during a naval battle, after all the fighting has\r\nbeen done by ramming, \"the last stern order of the brave\" is whispered\r\nthrough the ship: \"We're going to fire the guns!!\" This desperate course\r\nis taken and described--the air grows thick and dark with broken\r\nbreech, flying tube, and disrupted armour-plate, and when all was over--\r\n\r\n     \"... They punished the seven survivors\r\n  For wasting the ordnance stores.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: F. ANSTEY.\r\n(_From a Photograph by Messrs. Bassano, Limited._)]\r\n\r\nMr. Anstey (Guthrie) was already famous for his little series of\r\nsuccessful books, \"Vice Versâ,\" \"The Giant's Robe,\" \"The Tinted Venus,\"\r\n\"The Black Poodle,\" and \"A Fallen Idol,\" when he was invited to\r\ncontribute to _Punch_. In each and all of these stories there had been a\r\nclear and original idea, worked out with ingenuity and invested with\r\nrich and delicate humour. Their author was clearly a man for _Punch_. So\r\nthought Mr. Burnand, and Mr. Anstey shared the opinion. On November 4th,\r\n1885, therefore, appeared his first contribution \"Faux et Preterea\r\nNihil.\" His work was consistently good, and at the end of 1886 he was\r\ncalled to the Table, taking his place and eating his first Dinner in\r\nJanuary, 1887.\r\n\r\nMr. Anstey's writings attracted attention from the beginning, and in\r\ntheir reprinted form have been no less successful--the truest test of\r\nquality. Among the most delightful of these was the \"Model Music Hall\r\nSongs\"--songs and dramas _virginibus puerisque_, adapted to the\r\nrequirements of the members of the London County Council which sought\r\nout and found indecency in a marionette's pursuit of a butterfly. The\r\nidea opened up to Mr. Anstey a comic vista, which he has developed for\r\nour delectation. The songs and dances, with their words and directions,\r\nare for the most part screamingly funny, consisting partly in the\r\nperfectly realised absurdity and inanity of the performance, and partly\r\nin that quality of absolute truthfulness to life which we are forced to\r\nrealise in the presentation of them. Laughter is often produced by the\r\nmere faithfulness of an imitation, whether the thing copied is funny or\r\nnot. Simple mimicry has the power to make us laugh; and over that power,\r\nin all its phases of motive, act, and talk, Mr. Anstey has absolute\r\ncontrol. In addition, he has a genius for plot-making and verse-writing,\r\nbe it original or parody, which in its own line is unsurpassed in modern\r\nliterature. In his analysis of character and motive he seems to set\r\nbefore us our own weak selves laid bare, until his _voces populi_ become\r\n_voces animi_, the voice of the people speaking unpleasantly like the\r\nvoice of conscience.\r\n\r\nIn this comic reproduction of actual experience Mr. Anstey has travelled\r\nover the road pointed out by Mr. Burnand in his \"Happy Thoughts\" and\r\n\"Out of Town;\" but, adding greatly to the scientific truth of it, he\r\nseems to have lost something of the geniality and joviality of the form.\r\nMr. Anstey has placed Society on the dissecting-table, and probing with\r\na little less of the sympathy shown by Mr. du Maurier, he carries his\r\nobservation, consciously or unconsciously, to a much farther and more\r\nmerciless point. Not that he has no kindly feeling for his subjects; he\r\nhas--but he reserves it for his good people. Towards his snobs and cads\r\nand prigs he is pitiless; he turns his microscope upon them, and with\r\nfar less mercy than is to be found in a vivisector he lays bare their\r\nfalse hearts, points to their lying tongues, and tears them out without\r\na pang of remorse. It is all in fun, of course; but it is unmistakable.\r\nStill, who shall find fault with what is the essence of justice and\r\ntruth, which mercy only interferes with to weaken?\r\n\r\nThe burlesques in the \"Model Music Hall Songs\" are often as good as\r\ntheir originals--just as some of the Rejected Addresses by the Smiths\r\nwere as good as the genuine poems they parodied; and the representation\r\nof them is placed before the reader with more than photographic truth.\r\nIn \"So Shy!\" we see the lady \"of a mature age and inclined to a\r\ncomfortable embonpoint,\" who comes forward and sings--\r\n\r\n  \"I'm a dynety little dysy of the dingle,\r\n    So retiring and so timid and so coy--\r\n  If you ask me why so long I have lived single,\r\n    I will tell you--'tis because I am so shoy.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a notable fact that songs of this sort were driven off the\r\nbetter-class music-hall stage about this time, and there is little doubt\r\nthat Mr. Anstey, to whom Mr. Bernard Partridge afterwards rendered\r\nartistic help, took yeoman's share in the campaign. More certain it is\r\nthat with \"Mr. Punch's Young Reciter\" he effectively suppressed the\r\ndrawing-room spouter. No one with a sense of humour who has read that\r\nseries can now stand up and recite a poem of a sentimental or an heroic\r\nnature from the pens of Mr. Clement Scott or Mr. G. R. Sims without\r\ngenius to back him; and no one who heard it could retain his gravity to\r\nthe end. \"Burglar Bill\" melted almost to repentance by the innocent\r\nchild who asked him to burgle her doll's house, and whose salvation was\r\nfinally wrought by the gift of the baby's jamtart--killed the Young\r\nReciter by dint of pure ridicule and honest fun. He has made an\r\nunsophisticated reciter as impossible as a sympathetic and sentimental\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nAnd in \"Voces Populi\"--the popular dramas in dialogue, in which the\r\nconversation accurately and concisely describes the character,\r\ntemperament, and tastes of the speaker--there is a humorous verbal\r\nphotography of extraordinary vividness. 'Arry is no longer a symbol and\r\na type, as he is in Mr. Milliken's hands; he is a definite person in one\r\nparticular position in life and no other, and what he says could not, we\r\nfeel, possibly have been said in any other way, nor by any other person.\r\nAnd so along the whole gamut of the classes through which Mr. Anstey\r\nleads us. The humour is penetrating, and it is difficult to say where\r\nthe truth ends and the caricature begins. Who can forget the visit to\r\nthe Tudor Exhibition, when Henry VIII's remarkable hat was on view?\r\n\"'Arry,\" says 'Arriet to her escort; \"look 'ere; fancy a king goin'\r\nabout in a thing like that--pink with a green feather! Why, I wouldn't\r\nbe seen in it myself!\" 'Arry, who is clearly _farceur_, replies with a\r\npretty wit: \"Ah, but that was ole 'Enery all over, that was; he wasn't\r\none for show. He liked a quiet, unassumin' style of 'at, he did. 'None\r\no' yer loud pot'ats for Me!' he'd tell the Royal 'atters; 'find me a\r\ntile as won't attract people's notice, or you won't want a tile\r\nyerselves in another minute!' An' you may take yer oath they served him\r\npretty sharp, too!\" And so it is all through; the talk of the people, of\r\neverybody in all sorts of positions in life, is recorded in these\r\n\"Voces,\" and in all there is the same quality of nature.\r\n\r\nIn \"Travelling Companions,\" nearly as amusing and quite as observant, we\r\nare made to feel that the two heroes detest each other hardly more than\r\nMr. Anstey detests Culcherd, the more unsympathetic and contemptible of\r\nthe two. They are nearly as despicable as they are funny, and their\r\ncreator has little pity for them on that account. There is a \"plentiful\r\nlack of tenderness,\" but an abundance of humour to excuse it. This\r\nquality is not visible in \"Mr. Punch's Pocket Ibsen\"--a parody so good\r\nthat we sometimes wonder if the part we are reading is not really from\r\nthe hand of the Norwegian master. Nothing, surely, could be truer,\r\nnothing touched with a lighter hand than \"Pill-doctor Herdal\"--an\r\nachievement attained solely by a profound study of the dramatist. Again,\r\nin \"The Man from Blankley's\" and in \"Lyre and Lancet\" we have social\r\nsatires grafted on to a most entertaining plot--a creation in both cases\r\nwhich may be compared with Keene's drawings for observation, and with\r\nGoldsmith's and Molière's plays for the happy construction of these\r\ncomedies of errors. The plots assuredly would have extorted the\r\nadmiration of Labiche himself, so complicated and ingenious are they.\r\nBesides, everything seems so natural, so inevitable, \"so much of a\r\nlesson,\" that it is hardly to be wondered at that \"The Man from\r\nBlankley's\" was on more than one occasion actually given out as the text\r\nfor a sermon delivered from the pulpit.\r\n\r\nAnother excuse for music-hall treatment of an exquisite sort is afforded\r\nby the story of \"Under the Rose,\" which is inimitable. For example:--\r\n\r\n  THE SISTERS SARCENET (_on stage_): \"You men are deceivers\r\n  and awfully sly. Oh, you _are_!\"\r\n\r\n  MALE PORTION OF AUDIENCE (_as is expected from them_):\r\n  \"No, we _aren't_!\"\r\n\r\n  THE SISTERS S. (_archly_): \"Now you _know_ you are!\r\n\r\n  You come home with the milk; should your poor wife ask why,\r\n  'Pressing business, my pet,' you serenely reply,\r\n  When you've really been out on the 'Tiddle-y-hi!'\r\n       Yes, you _have_!\"\r\n\r\n  MALE AUDIENCE (_as before_): \"No, we've _not_!\"\r\n\r\n  THE SISTERS S. (_with the air of accusing angels_): \"Why,\r\n  you _know_ you have!\"\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes objected that the root of Mr. Anstey's success lies near\r\nthe surface, and is nothing but the vividness of his dialogues. It is a\r\ngreat deal more; it lies in the truth of his characters, subtly drawn,\r\nbut irresistible, and, now and again, tenderly pathetic. Thus may you\r\nsee the optimist and pessimist, and the link between them, in the\r\nfollowing scene in the Mall on Drawing-Room Day:--\r\n\r\n     CHEERY OLD LADY (_delighted_): \"I could see all the coachmen's 'ats\r\n     beautiful. We'll wait and see 'em all come out, John, won't we?\r\n     They won't be more than a hour and a half in there, I dessay.\"\r\n\r\n     A PERSON WITH A FLORID VOCABULARY: \"Well, if I'd ha' known all I\r\n     was goin' to see was a set o' blanky nobs shut up in their\r\n     blank-dash kerridges, blank my blanky eyes if I'd ha' stirred a\r\n     blanky foot, s'elp me dash, I wouldn't!\"\r\n\r\n     A VENDOR (_persuasively_): \"The kerrect lengwidge of hevery flower\r\n     that blows--one penny!\"\r\n\r\nIn the composition of his \"Voces\" and kindred work, it has been the\r\npractice of Mr. Anstey to visit the needful spot, where he would try to\r\nseize the salient points and the general tone, the speakers and the\r\nscene, trusting to luck for a chance incident, feature, or sentence that\r\nmight provide a subject. Sometimes he would have to go empty away; but\r\nas a rule he would find enough to provide the rough material for a\r\nsketch. Sometimes, too, he would combine hints and anecdotes received\r\nfrom his acquaintance with his own experience and invention; on rarer\r\noccasions he would happen upon an incident which could be worked up into\r\na sketch very much as it actually occurred, though with strict selection\r\nand careful elaboration. On the whole it may be taken that the\r\nconversations are mostly what _might_ have happened, but that they never\r\nwere shorthand reproductions of overheard talk; and the incidents are\r\nalmost invariably invented. Occasionally something in an exhibition or\r\nshow would suggest a typical comment, or a casual remark might provide\r\nan idea for a character; but a good deal is certainly unconscious\r\nreminiscence and fragmentary observation, and the residue pure\r\nguess-work.\r\n\r\nOf the artistic quality of Mr. Anstey's work there can be no\r\nquestion--neither of its humour, nor of its value as a complete\r\nreflection of English, and especially of Cockney, life. Old-fashioned\r\npeople may and do denounce it as newfangled; but does anyone doubt the\r\nsort of welcome that would have been accorded to it by Jerrold and\r\nThackeray and Gilbert à Beckett if they had had the good fortune to have\r\nan Anstey in their midst half-a-century ago?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R. C. LEHMANN\r\n(_From a Photograph by Elliott and Fry._)]\r\n\r\nMr. R. C. Lehmann, grand-nephew of W. H. Wills, one of _Punch's_ early\r\ncrew, had a good reputation as a Cambridge wit before Mr. Burnand\r\ncaptured him for _Punch_. In April, 1889, he began to edit \"The Granta,\"\r\nthe clever \"barrel-organ of the Cambridge undergraduates,\" satirical,\r\nbrightly humorous, and freshly youthful. On the 14th of the following\r\nDecember there appeared in _Punch_ his first contribution, a dialogue\r\nentitled \"Among the Amateurs,\" which has since been reprinted in \"The\r\nBillsbury Election.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lehmann lost no time in devising series of articles, which all\r\n_Punch_ readers will remember. Such were \"Modern Types\" and \"Mr. Punch's\r\nPrize Novels\" (one of the most successful, including parodies of a score\r\nof the leading authors of the day), \"In the Know,\" \"The Adventures of\r\nPicklock Holes,\" \"Letters to Abstractions,\" \"Lord Ormont's Mate and\r\nMatey's Aminta,\" \"Manners and Customs,\" and \"Studies in the New\r\nPoetry.\" Within four months of his first contribution Mr. Lehmann was\r\npromoted to the Table--an unprecedentedly rapid promotion--and he has\r\never since been one of the most diligent of contributors. Literary merit\r\napart, Mr. Lehmann's \"Conversational Hints for Young Shooters\" has\r\nprobably been received with greater favour throughout the country, on\r\naccount of its subject and its felicitous treatment, than any of the\r\nyoung author's works. Country readers are essentially sportsmen--in\r\nconversation, if not in fact; and nothing in humorous writing delights\r\nthem more than a clever burlesque on their favourite topic. You may hear\r\nthe book praised where one of the writer's more ambitious efforts may\r\npass unnoticed; and one of its passages is quoted with unction in many a\r\nshooting party. \"Johnson, who was placed forward, again stood under a\r\ncanopy of pheasants, and shot with brilliant success into the gaps....\r\nThe only theory which is accepted as explaining the catastrophe is one\r\nthat imputes a malignant cunning to the birds.\"\r\n\r\nThe year that saw Mr. Lehmann's appointment witnessed also the calling\r\nof his kinsman, Mr. Barry Pain, one of the chief contributors to \"The\r\nGranta.\" His story of \"The Hundred Gates,\" printed in \"Cornhill,\" struck\r\nMr. Burnand as a work of promise; indeed, Mr. Burnand is reported to\r\nhave found it so funny that he thought he must have written it himself.\r\nThe annexing of the writer was at once effected. One of his earliest\r\ncontributions to _Punch_ was the amusing parody of Tennyson's\r\n\"Throstle,\" just before Christmas, 1889; and a collection of comic\r\nCambridge definitions in imitation of Euclid followed. Then came a set\r\nof short stories called \"Storicules,\" and a series of articles\r\nconstituting a mock guide to conduct for young ladies. Since 1892 Mr.\r\nPain's work has fallen away, probably only for a time; for _Punch_ has\r\nproved well-nigh irresistible to every genuine humorist who is anxious\r\nto bring his faculty to bear on the risibility of the English public.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Pottinger Stephens, one of the wits of the \"Sporting Times,\"\r\nthe founder of the \"Topical Times,\" and member of the staff of the\r\n\"Daily Telegraph,\" was for two or three years on the outside salaried\r\nStaff of _Punch_. Contributing from 1889 to 1891, he wrote a series of\r\n\"queer tales\" as well as some attacks on the then South Western Railway\r\nmanagement, under the title of \"The Ways of Waterloo.\" Such dramatic\r\ncriticisms as were not undertaken by Mr. Burnand or relegated by him to\r\nMr. Arthur à Beckett, and numerous trifles besides, fell to him to do;\r\nbut on his departure for America the connection was broken, and not\r\nafterwards resumed.\r\n\r\nPassing by Mr. C. W. Cooke, we find Mr. Charles Geake, member of the Bar\r\nand Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, as the chief recruit of the year\r\n1890. To \"The Granta\" he had sent a casual contribution, and Mr. R. C.\r\nLehmann, appreciating his talent, proved his esteem by installing Mr.\r\nGeake as the Cambridge editor of that paper. From \"The Granta\" to\r\n_Punch_ has become a natural ascent, and on July 12th, 1890, Mr. Geake\r\nmade his first bow to London readers. Three months later a packet of\r\n_Punch_ office envelopes announced that he had been placed on the\r\nfooting of a regular outside contributor, and that it was now his\r\nprivilege to send his work straight to the printer's. At first he wrote\r\nnothing but verse--society verse, ballades, rondeaux, topical verse, and\r\nparodies in verse and prose, and then burlesques of books, such as the\r\ncapital imitation of \"The Tale of Two Telegrams\" (a \"Dolly Dialogue\" in\r\nthe manner of \"Anthony Hope\"), p. 97, Vol. CVII., September 1st, 1894,\r\nand \"The Blue Gardenia\" (October 20th, 1894, p. 185), with various skits\r\nand topical matter. \"Lays of the Currency\" are among the chief of Mr.\r\nGeake's poetical \"series,\" and \"Chronicles of a Rural Parish\"--the\r\nadventures and misadventures of a rural parishioner who wishes to\r\npatronise the Parish Councils Act--his principal effort in comic prose.\r\n\r\nThe year 1892 brought three new writers: Mr. Gerald F. Campbell, who\r\nbegan by contributing (on April 23rd) poems of sentiment, such as \"Town\r\nThoughts from the Country,\" and three months later \"The Cry of the\r\nChildren\" and \"Alone in London;\" R. F. Murray, the American-born author\r\nof \"The Scarlet Gown,\" who, through Mr. Andrew Lang's introduction, sent\r\nin a few verses shortly before his death; and Mr. Roberts, who finds his\r\nplace among the artists.\r\n\r\nMr. George Davies was an important accession of the following year. On\r\nonly half-a-dozen occasions had he ever been in print, and that in\r\nobscure publications, when he composed an \"Ethnographical Alphabet,\"\r\nbeginning \"A is an Afghan.\" The writer, who is something of a\r\ntsiganologue, emboldened by his success, followed up his alphabet, which\r\nappeared January 21st, 1893, and within a year had placed to his credit\r\nthree-score contributions, most of them in verse--rather a remarkable\r\nachievement for one heretofore considered a mere bookworm and dryasdust.\r\n\r\nAnother Cambridge man of originality and ingenuity, mainly in verse, is\r\nMr. Arthur A. Sykes--a \"Cantabard,\" as he himself would admit,\r\npeculiarly skilled in \"Cambrijingles.\" He began with \"In the Key of\r\nRuthene\" on May 6th, 1893, and followed it up with a laughable ode \"To a\r\nFashion-Plate Belle.\" It was accompanied with a comic, though hardly\r\nexaggerated, design of the female figure as depicted in ladies'\r\nfashion-papers--the drawing being also by Mr. Sykes. Since then many\r\nverses by him have appeared, in which quaint conception, sudden turn of\r\nthought, and strange achievements in rhyming (as in \"The Tour That Never\r\nWas,\" August 19th, 1893) are the chief figures. Then came the promotion\r\nembodied in the privilege of sending his contributions direct to the\r\nprinter before, instead of after, being submitted to the editorial eye;\r\nand a good deal of prose work followed, such as the \"Scarlet Afternoon,\"\r\na skit in dialogue suggested by Mr. R. S. Hichens' \"Green Carnation.\"\r\n\r\nLight verse from the Rev. Anthony C. Deane began on August 20th, 1892\r\n(\"Ad Puellam\"), but he was already a master of the art. Two months\r\nbefore his little volume of \"Frivolous Verses\" had appeared, and so\r\nstruck Mr. Andrew Lang that he reviewed it in a \"Daily News\"\r\nleading-article, invited the author to go and see him, and suggested his\r\nwriting for _Punch_. Mr. Deane had already been a \"Granta\" poet, and was\r\nwell known to Mr. Lehmann, who, finding that Mr. Lang had already\r\nspoken to Mr. Anstey, gladly added a word of introduction to the Editor.\r\nBy such means as these, oftener than by promiscuous outside application,\r\nis new blood found: the best men do not, as a rule, force forward their\r\nown work. Mr. Deane at that time was not twenty-two, nor was he yet\r\nordained. He passed the necessary period at the same theological\r\ncollege--Cuddesdon--that years before had sheltered Mr. Burnand, and\r\nwent on contributing verses to _Punch_, to the number (1894) of sixty or\r\nseventy; so that the course of his _Punch_ love has run very smooth.\r\n\r\nAnother literary godson of Mr. Lehmann's, and child of \"The Granta,\" is\r\nMr. Owen Seaman. Through the good offices of the former, Mr. Seaman's\r\n\"Rhyme of the Kipperling,\" nearly filling the first page of _Punch_, was\r\ninserted in the number for January 13th, 1894. This imitation of Mr.\r\nRudyard Kipling's \"Rhyme of the Three Sealers\" was its own\r\nrecommendation, and since that time Mr. Seaman has been one of the most\r\nprolific outside contributors of the year. His series comprise\r\n\"She-Notes\"--a skit on \"Keynotes\" and \"Airs Resumptive\"--of which the\r\nfourth, \"To Julia in Shooting-togs (and a Herrickose Vein)\" is an\r\nadmirable specimen of its class. Art and political criticism in verse\r\nand prose are employed to illustrate the writer's facility and classic\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nTo this list, necessarily incomplete, in spite of its length, a few\r\nnames remain to be added, and an incongruous party they form. Professor\r\nForbes; Mr. J. C. Wilson, mantle manufacturer; and Mr. J. J. Lushington,\r\nof the Suffolk Chief Constable's Office, first a soldier and finally an\r\nauctioneer (a giant of nearly six feet seven, who would have formed a\r\ngood fourth to Thackeray, \"Jacob Omnium,\" and Dean Hole)--men of every\r\nsort and condition, brought together by the universal brotherhood of\r\nhumour. Mrs. Frances Collins was a contributor, and her _Punch_\r\nutterance upon Judge Bayley's curious decision at Westminster County\r\nCourt in January, 1877, as to next-door music that is \"intolerable,\" yet\r\nnot \"actionable\" (\"Music hath (C)Harms\"), is still remembered and\r\nquoted. Another lady-wit of the present day is Mr. Lehmann's sister,\r\nLady Campbell, who wrote the women's letters in the series of \"Manners\r\nand Customs,\" while her brother took the male side of the\r\ncorrespondence. Mrs. Leverson has been the contributor of numerous\r\nclever prose parodies and general articles, the chief of which up to\r\nJune, 1895, has been \"The Scarlet Parasol.\" Mr. James Payn has also\r\nworked for _Punch_, but very little--only to the extent of placing some\r\nlittle pleasantry at its service, and now and then suggesting a subject\r\nfor illustration. A set of rhymes by Mr. H. D. Traill, reprinted in his\r\nvolume entitled \"Number Twenty,\" was his sole contribution, the\r\n\"Saturday Review\" having had a sort of prescriptive right to all his\r\nwork of this description. It is the greater pity, for even the lightest\r\nof his verses have the true ring and, according to some, much of the\r\nvigour characteristic of Mr. Rudyard Kipling's work. Mr. Arthur\r\nArmitage, too, was for many years a contributor. Being a solicitor in\r\npractice, he kept his identity a secret. He was always known to the\r\nEditor and Proprietors as \"Mr. A. Armstrong,\" and up to this present\r\npublication he never revealed the levity of his youth. His first\r\ncontribution was \"Marriage Customs of the Great Britons,\" which was\r\ninserted in the \"Pocket-Book\" for 1855. After writing regularly for this\r\noffspring of _Punch's_, Mr. Armitage was, in 1861, specially invited to\r\ncontribute to the paper itself on topics political, social, and\r\ncommercial--only a satire on \"The Baby of the Papal States\" (Louis\r\nNapoleon) being rejected, on the ground that, were it inserted, war with\r\nFrance would be inevitable. On Mark Lemon's death Mr. Armitage ceased\r\nhis connection as an \"outside regular,\" and five years later reprinted a\r\nnumber of his most amusing _Punch_ verses and articles under the title\r\nof \"Winkleton-on-Sea.\" Frederick Gale--better known as \"The Old Buffer\"\r\nand as the great cricket authority--wrote a short series for _Punch_.\r\nThen Mr. Walter Sichel, since the beginning of 1892, has contributed\r\nsome prose and more verse, such as the series of \"Men who have taken me\r\nin--to dinner,\" \"Lays of Modern Home,\" \"Inns and Outs,\" as well as\r\n\"Rhymes out of Season,\" \"The Diary of an Old Joke,\" and the original\r\n\"Queer Queries.\" The late magistrate, Mr. Hosack, too, contributed\r\nseveral sharp police-court sketches; and \"Arthur Sketchley\" had a\r\ncapital story to tell, but spoiled it in the telling. Even H. J. Byron,\r\ncontrary to general belief, tried his hand as a _Punch_ contributor, but\r\nhe was somewhat dull. He admitted, in fact, that he wanted to keep all\r\nhis fun for his plays, and so starved his _Punch_ work of its legitimate\r\nhumour. Mr. Arthur E. Viles's verses on \"Temple Bar\" (December, 1877)\r\nmay be mentioned, and Mr. Leopold Godfrey Turner's name must not be\r\nomitted. But, of the contributors of trifles, a number must remain\r\nanonymous--as, indeed, many do from choice; inevitably so before 1847,\r\nwhen it first became the practice to enter up outsiders' work in their\r\nown names. And among these occasional contributors the present writer is\r\nproud to range himself.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the literature of _Punch_, we become sensible of a change\r\nnot dissimilar to that which we find to have taken place in its art.\r\nThere is nowadays no Jerrold, whose fulminating passion and fine frenzy\r\noften came dangerously near to \"high-falutin'.\" There is perhaps no\r\nversifier at the Table with quite the same fancy or taste as Gilbert\r\nAbbott à Beckett, Shirley Brooks, and Percival Leigh. But we have\r\ninstead a keener observation of the life and customs of the day, an\r\ningenuity and an elegance that go better with the taste and habit of\r\nthought of the times. In the old days it was not uncommon in discussing\r\n_Punch's_ poetry to urge in apology that--\r\n\r\n            Wit will shine\r\n  Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line.\r\n\r\nNowadays, when comedy and rapier have to a great extent replaced farce\r\nand sword, finish is accounted of greater importance than of yore, and\r\ngrace and daintiness are accepted where simple fun was formerly the\r\naim--an aim, by the way, which was as frequently missed as now. Let the\r\nreader who is inclined to be as severe on latter-day _Punch_ as on\r\nlatter-day everything, take down one of the early volumes, and seek for\r\nthe side-splitting articles and epigrams, the verse apoplectic with fun,\r\nwhich we are taught to expect there. He will learn that it is not so\r\nmuch that the quality of _Punch_ has changed, despite the great names\r\nof the past. He will find that the change is due rather to modern\r\nfashion and to modern views than to any deterioration of _Punch's_. Good\r\nthings are there now, as then; and now, as then, many of the best\r\nwriters in the country contribute periodically to its pages. With verse\r\nand article, epigram and parody, _Punch_ continues to be a record and a\r\nmirror of his times--a comic distorting mirror perhaps, but still a\r\nglass of fashion and of history, with fun for its mercury, which,\r\nthrough its literature, pleasantly and agreeably reflects the deeds and\r\nthe thoughts of the people. What of it, if his verse now and again is\r\nonly passable? Sometimes it is fine--always acceptable, and rarely below\r\nan elevated established standard; anyhow, some years ago, Mr. Joseph\r\nChamberlain's single offering was rejected on its demerits by the\r\n\"monument of British humour.\" Perhaps the Editor judged it as _Punch's_\r\nrailway-porter judged an old lady's pet in accordance with railway\r\nrules: Cats is \"dogs,\" and rabbits is \"dogs,\" and so's parrots; but this\r\n'ere tortis is a hinsect, and there ain't no--need--for it. And the tone\r\nof _Punch's_ more serious utterances is now that of the dining-room\r\nrather than of the debating society and the vestry room. Mr. Ruskin,\r\namong others, deplored _Punch's_ kid gloves and evening-dress, when\r\namiable obituary notices on Baron Bethell--(had he not been _Punch's_\r\ncounsel in the old days?)--and the Bishop of Winchester were published.\r\n\"Alas, Mr. Punch,\" he wrote, \"is it come to this? And is there to be no\r\nmore knocking down, then? And is your last scene in future to be shaking\r\nhands with the devil?\"[49] _Punch_ can still hit hard; though \"knocking\r\ndown\" is no longer his main delight. His text has become as refined as\r\nhis art--and that, of course, is the reason that it no longer commands\r\nthe chief attention of the class that once was led by it. At that time\r\nits art alone carried it into circles that abhorred its politics, and it\r\nis recorded that Mulready was driven to excuse himself to one of the\r\nStaff for not reading the text by the lame confession that he was \"no\r\nbookworm!\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48] Having mentioned the name of Edmund Yates, I may here contradict\r\nthe statement that that distinguished journalist ever wrote for _Punch_.\r\nThe belief arose partly through Martin F. Tupper's \"My Life as an\r\nAuthor\":--\"I remember also how he dropped in on me at Albany one\r\nmorning, just as I happened to be pasting into one of my books a few\r\nquips and cranks anent my books from _Punch_. He adjured me 'not to do\r\nit! for Heaven's sake spare me!' covering his face with his hands.\r\n'What's the matter, friend?' 'I wrote all those,' added he in earnest\r\npenitence, 'and I vow faithfully never to do it again!' 'Pray don't make\r\na rash promise, Edmund, and so unkind a one too; I rejoice in all this\r\nsort of thing--it sells my books, besides--I'se Maw-worm--I likes to be\r\ndespised!' 'Well, it's very good-natured of you to say so, but I really\r\nnever will do it again;' and the good fellow never did--so have I lost\r\nmy most telling advertisement\" (p. 326). Considering, however, that\r\nYates was on the worst of terms with Mark Lemon, we may easily believe\r\nthat he did not contribute to his paper, and as during his early\r\nfriendship with Mr. Burnand he never hinted at writing for _Punch_ as an\r\noutsider, the statement may be dismissed. Moreover, so fantastic is the\r\nscene described that, if strictly accurate, it was most likely a\r\npractical joke played off upon the egotistical old gentleman, whose\r\nworst enemies never accused him of a sense of humour.\r\n\r\n[49] \"Fors,\" 1874 (p. 125).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n_PUNCH'S_ ARTISTS: 1841.\r\n\r\n     _Punch's_ Primitive Art--A.

It is said that when\r\nGeorge Hodder was introduced to a distinguished Royal Academician, he\r\ncould find nothing better to say, with which to open the conversation,\r\nthan the tremendous sentiment--\"Art is a great thing, sir!\" _Punch_\r\ngradually but surely realised, too, how great a thing art is, and for\r\nmany years past he has sought out artists to recruit his Staff, where\r\nbefore he looked chiefly for draughtsmen. The statement may seem a\r\ncurious one to make, but it is an opinion shared nowadays by some of the\r\nbest artists on _Punch_ and off it, that were the drawings sent in\r\nto-day which were contributed by the majority of the original artistic\r\nStaff, not excluding the mighty Leech himself, they would be declined\r\nwithout thanks, and--according to the somewhat harsh rule that has for\r\nsome time prevailed--without return of their contribution. There was a\r\npromiscuous rough-and-ready manner about the drawing of comic cuts in\r\nthose early days, when intended for the periodical press, that would\r\noffend the majority of people to-day. There was no photography then to\r\nenable the artist to draw as big as he chose, and then to reproduce the\r\ndrawings on to the wood-block in any size he please. There were no\r\nblocks which could be taken into sections and distributed among\r\nhalf-a-dozen engravers at once for swift and careful cutting. There was\r\nno \"process,\" which permitted of reduction and reproduction of the\r\nfinest pen-and-ink work. There was no \"drawing from the life\" for these\r\nlittle pictures of \"life and character.\" The joke was the thing, not the\r\nartistic drawing of it. Farce and burlesque had not yet developed into\r\ncomedy and comedietta, refined by degrees and beautifully æsthetic.\r\nNowadays, as Mr. du Maurier has publicly declared, everything must be\r\ndrawn straight from Nature, without trusting to memory or observation\r\nalone. \"Men and women, horses, dogs, seascapes, landscapes, everything\r\none can make little pictures out of, must be studied from life.... Even\r\ncentaurs, dragons, and cherubs must be closely imitated from Nature--or\r\nat least as much as can be got from the living model!\" It is, therefore,\r\nmore than likely that Leech would have been told that he must really be\r\nmore careful in his work before _Punch_ could publish it; and his first\r\ncontribution of \"Foreign Affairs\" would have been rejected as being\r\naltogether too rough and with far too little point for its size. All\r\n_Punch's_ pictures at this day, no doubt, cannot be said to surpass the\r\nartistic achievement of some of the earliest cuts, but there is almost\r\ninvariably an artistic intention, technically speaking, which excuses\r\neven the poorer work--a suggestion of the drawing-school rather than, to\r\nuse a modern expression, mere \"dancing upon paper.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough from the beginning to the present day the artistic Staff which\r\nhas sat at _Punch's_ Table has numbered less than a score, and the\r\noutside Staff, unattached (such as Captain Howard, Mr. Sands, Mr.\r\nPritchett, Mr. Fairfield, Mr. Atkinson, Mr. Ralston, and Mr. Corbould),\r\nbut very few more--the total number of draughtsmen whose pencils have\r\nbeen seen in _Punch's_ pages amount to about one hundred and seventy. In\r\nsome cases sketches have been sent in anonymously; a few others I have\r\nbeen unable to trace; but these, it must be admitted, are hardly worth\r\nthe trouble expended on them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. S. HENNING.\r\n(_From a Water-Colour by his son, Mr. Walton Henning._)]\r\n\r\nThe earliest recruit was Archibald S. Henning, the first in importance,\r\nas he was to be cartoonist, and first to appear before the public,\r\ninasmuch as the wrapper was from his hand. He was the third son of John\r\nHenning, friend of Scott and Dr. Chalmers, on the strength of his famous\r\nminiature restoration of the Parthenon frieze, of which he engraved the\r\nfigures on slate in intaglio; and he was well known besides not only for\r\nthese copies of the Elgin marbles, but for his portrait-busts and\r\nmedallions. Precision in all things was one of his characteristics, and\r\neven showed itself in the inscriptions in his family Bible, wherein he\r\nset on record that his son Archibald was \"born at Edinburgh, on the 18th\r\nof February, at 30 minutes past 3 a.m.\" But this accuracy was not\r\ninherited, although the son was brought up to assist his father on the\r\nfriezes which he executed on Burton's Arch at Hyde Park Corner, and on\r\nthe Athenæum Club-house. His drawing was loose and undistinguished; his\r\nsense of humour, such as it was, unrefined; and his fun exaggerated and\r\nfalse. He was a Bohemian, but not of the type of his brother-in-law\r\nKenny Meadows, preferring a class of entertainment less exalted than\r\nthose who so warmly welcomed his sister's husband. Mr. Sala tells me\r\nthat Henning painted the show-blind for the Post Office, and afterwards\r\nsteadily drifted down the stream of time; and Mr. Sala ought to know,\r\nfor he employed him in those impecunious but jolly days when the\r\neditorship of \"Chat\" was in his hands. One of the early memories of Mr.\r\nWalton Henning, Archibald's son, is being sent by his father to collect\r\nthe sum of one pound sterling from Mr. Sala, and, after sitting on the\r\noffice-stool from eleven in the morning until two, being sent back\r\nwithout the money, but instead with a letter of apology and of\r\ncongratulation on possessing a son who could sit for three hours, like\r\nPatience on a monument, smiling at an empty till. Henning remained with\r\n_Punch_ till the summer of 1842, having contributed eleven cartoons to\r\nthe first volume and several to the second, the last of which was that\r\nof \"Indirect Taxation,\" on p. 201. He also illustrated Albert Smith's\r\nsocial \"physiologies\" of \"The Gent\" and \"The Ballet Girl\"--not ill-done;\r\nand when _Punch_ had no further need of his services he transferred them\r\nsuccessively to \"The Squib,\" \"The Great Gun,\" and \"Joe Miller the\r\nYounger,\" in each case taking the post of cartoonist. Later on he worked\r\noccasionally on \"The Man in the Moon\" and on the \"Comic Times,\" and died\r\nin 1864.\r\n\r\nNo greater loss was Brine, Henning's fellow-cartoonist, who remained\r\nwith _Punch_ until the beginning of the third volume, having drawn\r\nnearly a dozen cartoons for each of the two volumes. He was a poor and\r\noften a \"fudgy\" draughtsman, gifted with extremely little humour, who\r\nhad nevertheless worked a good deal at a Life Academy in the Tottenham\r\nCourt Road, along with Thomas Woolner, Elmore, Claxton, and J. R.\r\nHerbert, and had even studied in Paris. He had some strange notions as\r\nto figure-drawing, some of which he would impart to such young students\r\nas cared to listen. One of these rules, which he sought to impress on\r\nMr. Birket Foster's 'prentice mind, was never to draw ankle-joints on\r\nfemale legs; but Mr. Foster did not remain a figure-draughtsman long\r\nenough to benefit by this valuable advice. Brine was poorly paid, some\r\nof his smaller cuts commanding a sum no higher than three-and-six; but\r\nit is impossible to say, looking at these sketches, that his efforts\r\nwere seriously underpaid.\r\n\r\nAnother of the Old Guard was John Phillips--who is not to be confused\r\nwith Watts Phillips, a contributor of a later period. He was the son of\r\nan eccentric old water-colour painter, well known in his day, and has\r\nbeen identified as the scene-painter whom Landells introduced later to\r\nthe \"Illustrated London News.\" Phillips, with Crowquill, illustrated\r\nReynolds' popular \"continuation\" of Dickens' Pickwick Papers, entitled\r\n\"Pickwick Abroad,\" and, like Brine, he received his _congé_ when the\r\ntransfer of _Punch_ to Bradbury and Evans took place.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was by far the most important and valuable draughtsman of\r\nthe quartette--William Newman. He was a very poor man, who in point of\r\npayment for his work suffered more than the rest; and when he asked for\r\na slight increase in terms, he was met with a refusal on the ground that\r\n\"Mr. John Leech required such high prices.\" He was an old hand at\r\npictorial satire, and was one of those who drew the little caricatures\r\nin \"Figaro in London\" several years before. He was brought on to _Punch_\r\nby Landells, but, owing to his lack of breeding and of common manners,\r\nhe was never invited to the Dinner, nor did any of his colleagues care\r\nto associate with him. Unfortunately for him he was an extremely\r\nsensitive man, and the neglect with which he was perhaps not unnaturally\r\ntreated preyed greatly upon his mind. For a considerable time he was the\r\nmost prolific draughtsman on the paper. Thus in 1846 there are no fewer\r\nthan eighty-seven cuts by him; in 1847, one hundred and twenty-seven; in\r\n1848, one hundred and sixty-four; and in 1849, one hundred and\r\ntwenty-one. From the cut on _Punch's_ first title-page down to the year\r\n1850 his work is everywhere to be seen, in every degree of importance,\r\nfrom the little _silhouettes_ called \"blackies,\" which usually\r\nconstituted little pictorial puns in the manner of Thomas Hood, and\r\nwhich were paid--those of them which were good and funny enough to be\r\nused--at the all-round rate of eighteen shillings per dozen. Instances\r\nof his happy punning vein are the sketches of a howling dog chained to a\r\npost, entitled \"The Moaning of the Tide;\" a portrait of a\r\nvillainous-looking fellow, \"Open to Conviction;\" a horse insisting on\r\ndrinking at a pond through which he is being driven, \"Stopping at a\r\nWatering-Place;\" a hare nursing her young, \"The Hare a Parent;\" a man\r\nwrestling with his cornet, \"A most Distressing Blow;\" and a street-boy\r\npicking a soldier's pocket, \"Relieving Guard.\" But he was soon promoted\r\nto other work; and to the first and second volumes, at times of\r\npressure, he even contributed a cartoon. This service was four times\r\nrepeated in 1846, and again in 1847 and 1848, when Leech met with his\r\nserious bathing accident at Bonchurch: on which occasion the great John\r\nwas put to bed, as Dickens explained it, with a row of his namesakes\r\nround his forehead. The cartoon in question was that entitled \"Dirty\r\nFather Thames,\" and a glance at it will show how great was the\r\nimprovement in the draughtsman's art. Newman did not, however, confine\r\nhimself to _Punch_ all this while; he had worked as cartoonist to \"The\r\nSquib\" in 1842; and again for the \"Puppet-Show,\" \"Diogenes,\" and H. J.\r\nByron's \"The Comic News\" in 1864. Then, disappointed at the little\r\nadvance he had made in the world, he emigrated to the United States,\r\nwhere more lucrative employment awaited him. He had a greater sense of\r\nbeauty and a more refined touch than most of his colleagues; and though\r\nhe did not shine as a satirist, he was always well in the spirit of\r\n_Punch_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H. G. HINE, V.P.R.I.\r\n(_From a Photograph by E. Wheeler, Brighton._)]\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting of _Punch's_ earliest men before the advent of\r\nLeech was H. G. Hine, who up to 1895 was the octogenarian Vice-President\r\nof the Institute of Painters in Water-Colours, whose broad and masterly\r\ndrawings of poetic landscape have been the artistic wonder of recent\r\nyears. He began to draw for _Punch_ in September, 1841, and\r\nthenceforward bore with Newman the brunt of the illustration. He was\r\nreally a serious painter--a water-colour artist of strong aim and\r\nconsiderable accomplishment. Just before the starting of _Punch_\r\nLandells had, as has already been explained, launched a landscape\r\nperiodical called \"The Cosmorama,\" and had commissioned Hine to go to\r\nthe London Dock and make a drawing on the wood. The work was not new to\r\nhim, as Wood, a master-engraver of the time, taking pity on the sense of\r\nfoolish powerlessness with which every beginner is afflicted, had\r\nexplained to him the secret of the craft. Landscape was thus his\r\nacknowledged line when he found himself at the Docks with his round of\r\nboxwood in his hand. He marked off a square upon it, and, in order to\r\n\"get his hand in,\" he made what would nowadays be called a _remarque_ on\r\nthe margin--a comic sketch of a dustman and his dog. The block was\r\nfinished, and carried to Landells, who looked at it in some surprise.\r\n\"Did you do that?\" said the North Countryman, pointing to the dustman.\r\n\"Would you draw sketches like that for _Poonch_?\" \"But I'm not a\r\nfigure-draughtsman,\" objected Hine. \"Yes, you are; and it's just what we\r\nwant for _Poonch_.\" So Hine was enrolled, and in his line became an\r\nexceedingly popular draughtsman. He began by making batches of the\r\n\"blackies\" aforesaid, designing them and their clever punning titles\r\nwith the greatest freedom, unhampered by editorial interference. He\r\nworked for _Punch_ until 1844, and rapidly became a contributor of the\r\nfirst importance, whose merits were fully appreciated. One cut in\r\nparticular delighted Mark Lemon--that of \"A Long Nap,\" in which a toper\r\nhas fallen into a sleep so deep and protracted that a spider has spun a\r\nstrong web from the man's nose to the bottle and the table before\r\nhim.[50] \"Upon my word!\" cried Lemon on examining the block when it was\r\ndelivered, \"Mr. Hine is really tremendous!\" Hine had greater imagination\r\nand ingenuity than Newman, a brighter fancy and keener wit; and to him\r\nrather than to others would application be made for the realisation of\r\nnew ideas. At Landells' request he produced the accompanying \"project\"\r\nfor a _Punch_ medal or seal; which, however, was never carried into\r\nexecution. His, too, were the stinging Anti-Graham Wafers, to which\r\nreference is made elsewhere; and many other designs that went far to\r\nincrease _Punch's_ popularity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DESIGN FOR \"PUNCH\" SEAL, BY H. G. HINE.]\r\n\r\nHe was chief stock-artist, so to say; for Leech did not at once assume\r\nthe commanding position on the paper that was soon to be his. And while\r\nHine shared with him the honour of drawing \"Punch's Pencillings,\" as the\r\ncartoons were called--several of the series of \"Social Miseries\" being\r\nfrom his hand--he produced from time to time the chief cut when it\r\naspired to the dignity of a political caricature.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, however, the amount of work sent to Hine was greatly\r\nreduced. It was now some time since he had contributed the whole of the\r\ncuts to the first \"Almanac,\" but he was still an occasional cartoonist\r\n(Vols. III., IV., and V.); so that he was the more surprised at being\r\nroughly--and, as he proved, unjustly--accused of being late with a\r\nblock. Other unpleasantnesses, which seemed to him gratuitous, suggested\r\nthe idea that he might not be wanted on _Punch_. He put the point\r\nblankly, and was reassured. Still, the quantity of work sent him\r\ndiminished; and as nothing came by Christmas, Hine accepted the offer of\r\nChristmas-work by the publisher of \"The Great Gun\"--for which, by the\r\nway, he never received payment. Then there suddenly arrived a mass of\r\nblocks from _Punch_; but they were returned with the message that, not\r\nhearing from his former proprietors, he had made other arrangements. And\r\nthat was the end of his connection. Later on he worked for \"Joe Miller\r\nthe Younger,\" \"Mephystopheles,\" and \"The Man in the Moon,\" and used his\r\npencil, in the true Spirit of a genuine sportsman, in pointing his\r\nwell-barbed jokes against his old paper with as much enthusiasm as he\r\nhad before given to its service. On page 153 of the second volume of\r\n_Punch_ may be seen a little cut entitled \"Choice Spirits in\r\nBond\"--being the portraits of himself and the lanky William Newman in\r\nthe dock of a police-court. Although fifty-four years had passed, the\r\nstrong resemblance of the little likeness could still be recognised by\r\nthose who knew the artist in the last few months of his life.\r\n\r\nAfter the collapse of \"The Man in the Moon\" Hine dropped out of comic\r\ndraughtsmanship. By this time, indeed, he was tired of the work, for he\r\nhad begun to think in jokes, to turn every thought to ridicule, and to\r\nlook upon conversation rather as raw material for pun-making than as a\r\nmeans of expressing and interchanging ideas. The last straw was an\r\noccasion when he spent half a night with Horace Mayhew in trying to make\r\na joke to complete a series for \"Cruikshank's Almanack\"--the very\r\nsituation in Pope's epigram:--\r\n\r\n  \"You beat your pate, and fancy wit will come;\r\n  Knock as you please, there's nobody at home.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another had arisen who was destined to overshadow for many\r\nyears the rest of his colleagues, and while he lived to be the life and\r\nsoul of the undertaking--Mr. Punch incarnate. This was John Leech, whose\r\nsignature first appears on page 43 of the first volume.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Frith, R.A., sought to persuade the overworked Leech to take a\r\nholiday, he added, just to drive the matter home: \"If anything happened\r\nto you, who are the 'backbone of _Punch_,' what would become of the\r\npaper?\" At which Leech smiled, says his biographer, and retorted, \"Don't\r\ntalk such rubbish! Backbone of _Punch_, indeed! Why, bless your heart,\r\nthere isn't a fellow at work upon the paper that doesn't think _that_ of\r\nhimself, and with about as much right and reason as I should. _Punch_\r\nwill get on well enough without me, or any of those who think themselves\r\nof such importance.\" In his life-time none would have been found to\r\nshare the speaker's views; nevertheless, _Punch_--for all Leech's\r\nparamount importance to the paper--has maintained his prosperity, and\r\nmore than doubled his lease of life since Leech laid down his pencil.\r\nYet in his time he was as much the artistic _Punch_ as Jerrold was the\r\nliterary; and there are nearly as many who still believe that Leech at\r\none time was _Punch's_ Editor as accord the same unmerited honour to\r\nJerrold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN LEECH.\r\n(_From the Portrait by Sir John E. Millais, Bart., R.A., in the National\r\nPortrait Gallery._)]\r\n\r\nThe story of Leech's early life has been already told. How he was the\r\nson of the luckless owner of the London coffee-house in Ludgate Hill;\r\nhow Flaxman saw his infantile drawings and declared he would be nothing\r\nbut an artist--nay, \"he _was_ an artist;\" how, at the Charterhouse, the\r\ngentle, nervous lad was schoolfellow of Thackeray, with whom he formed a\r\npassionate, life-long friendship; and of yet another hearty friend, Mr.\r\nNethercote; how, when he was medical student at Bartholomew's Hospital,\r\nhe contracted another evergreen friendship with Percival Leigh, and\r\nformed an acquaintanceship, long maintained, but never fully ripened,\r\nwith another medico--Albert Smith, of Middlesex; how his father's\r\nfailure caused him to give up medicine and the knife in favour of art\r\nand the pencil--by the exercise of which, when he was still under Dr.\r\nCockle, son of the pill-doctor, he had already fascinated his\r\nfellow-students, and in particular Percival Leigh--on whose initiative\r\nit was that the \"Comic Latin Grammar\" was carried into execution. All\r\nthis and more has ere now been recorded. But it all bears directly on\r\nhis _Punch_ career, and must not by any means be overlooked.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, when he was but nineteen years of age, he had made a bid for\r\nthe unhappy Seymour's vacant place as Charles Dickens' illustrator; but\r\nhe had been already forestalled by \"Phiz,\" and Leech was perforce\r\nrejected, as Thackeray had been refused before him, and Buss dismissed.\r\nLeech was already a good draughtsman on wood, having while resident with\r\nOrrin Smith the wood-engraver--he who had previously tried to magnetise\r\nthe idea of a \"London Charivari\" into life--received many practical\r\nhints of the greatest artistic value. For some time afterwards he worked\r\nin harmony with his fellow-student of a literary turn, whose noble\r\nbrass-plate inscribed \"Mr. Albert Smith, M.R.C.S., Surgeon-Dentist!\"\r\nonce brought upon the artist, says Percival Leigh, the candid chaff, of\r\na vulgar street-urchin. \"Good boy!\" said Leech, appreciating the\r\nattention and rewarding it with a penny. \"Now go and insult somebody\r\nelse.\" He drew furthermore upon the stone, and distinguished himself in\r\n\"Bell's Life in London\"--the paper to which several of the most eminent\r\ncomic artists of the day then contributed--and in 1841, five years after\r\nhis first-published \"Etchings and Sketchings, by A. Pen, Esq.,\" he\r\nissued in its complete form his \"Children of the Mobility.\" It was at\r\nthat time that Percival Leigh, having satisfied himself of the character\r\nand tone of the new comic paper, not only made his own début in it, but\r\nintroduced his friend and colleague, John Leech--with what distressing\r\nresult as to his full-page block of \"Foreign Affairs\" the chapter on\r\ncartoons discloses. (_See_ p. 173.) And here it may be added that all\r\nwas not plain sailing between Leech and _Punch_ at the commencement; for\r\nsoon after he resumed work he struck for higher terms. Until he got his\r\nway he did no more work for the paper--as the reader may satisfy himself\r\nby turning to its pages; and when he did, his triumph was visited, as\r\nhas already been described, upon the heads of less talented\r\ncontributors. It may safely be assumed that Leech knew nothing of this,\r\nfor the gentleness of the man was such that he could not have suffered\r\nthe idea that his success meant others' disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThree things may be said to have brought Leech's powers as a humorous\r\ndraughtsman prominently before the public--his illustrations to the\r\n\"Comic Latin Grammar,\" the skit on the Mulready envelope (the most\r\nsuccessful of all the versions published), and his early _Punch_ work.\r\nMr. Frith tells of Mulready's indignation at Leech's drawing--not at the\r\ncaricature itself, but at the leech in a bottle, by which the\r\nAcademician took it for granted that the draughtsman meant to designate\r\nhim by innuendo as a \"blood-sucker;\" and of Leech's surprise and pain at\r\nbeing so suspected, and how the two men became fast friends ever after.\r\nOnce a regular _Punch_ man, Leech immediately expanded, and as quickly\r\nhit the taste and fancy of the public; and from that day forward rarely\r\ndid his hand or his humorous or tragic faculty play him false; nor did\r\nthe people falter in its praise or its allegiance.\r\n\r\nAlthough he expanded, he yet took some time to settle down. Not until\r\nthe sixth volume (1844) could he be considered paramount in what was\r\nesteemed the higher walk of cartooning--a department which he\r\nsubsequently shared, first with Doyle, and then with Tenniel. But it was\r\nin the social cuts that he excelled--in his pictures of low life that\r\nare never low; in his great mastery in the delineation of character and\r\nhis gift of seeing humour in most scenes of everyday happening, and his\r\npower of recording comic conceptions, unfailingly and irresistibly. It\r\nis true that as Mr. Punch went up in the social scale Leech accompanied\r\nhim in the rise--if, indeed, it was not Leech, together with Thackeray's\r\npowerful help, who elevated _Punch_. At the same time he sympathised\r\nprofoundly with the horrors of poverty and oppression, and looked kindly\r\non gutter-children and on honest dirt and misery; and to the end he\r\nregarded the \"snob,\" the 'Arry of his day, with the genial contempt he\r\nhad lavished on him at the beginning. Thackeray appreciated the change\r\nin the paper, and recorded it, too; though he credits Jerrold with a\r\npolicy which was nought but the policy of a comic paper softened in its\r\nasperities by time, and encouraged by the greater refinement of its\r\nStaff and of its more cultivated public.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Leech,\" said Thackeray, \"surveys society from the gentleman's point\r\nof view. In old days, when Mr. Jerrold lived and wrote for that famous\r\nperiodical, he took the other side; he looked up at the rich and great\r\nwith a fierce, a sarcastic aspect, and a threatening posture, and his\r\noutcry or challenge was: 'Ye rich and great, look out! We, the people,\r\nare as good as you. Have a care, ye priests, wallowing on a tithe pig\r\nand rolling in carriages and four; ye landlords, grinding the poor; ye\r\nvulgar fine ladies, bullying innocent governesses, and what not--we will\r\nexpose your vulgarity; we will put down your oppression; we will\r\nvindicate the nobility of our common nature,' and so forth. A great deal\r\nwas to be said on the Jerrold side, a great deal was said--perhaps, even\r\na great deal too much.\" And now, says Thackeray in effect, Leech looks\r\nat all these people with a certain respect for their riches, with an\r\namiable curiosity concerning their footmen's calves. Nevertheless, to\r\nthe end he was not kinder to Dives' oppression, less sympathetic towards\r\nthe troubles of Lazarus, nor more indulgent to the vulgarity of the\r\nsnob; nor a whit more tolerant of viciousness, affectation, or meanness\r\nof any kind.\r\n\r\nOf Leech's political work (for which at first he entertained so great a\r\ndislike) I say perhaps enough in dealing with what may be called\r\n_Punch's_ Big Drum--the weekly cartoon. Taken together, those designs\r\nmight be held to represent a life's good work; yet they represent but a\r\nfraction of what he executed during his seven-and-twenty years' hard\r\nlabour. If after a close study of all his productions with pencil and\r\netching-needle, you ask yourself what constitutes his real life's-work,\r\nyou will probably choose to ignore his book plates--even those to the\r\nComic Histories of Rome and England, to the sporting novels of \"Mr.\r\nSponge,\" and the rest--and point to his \"Pictures of Life and\r\nCharacter,\" as given forth in one continuous stream from 1841 to 1864.\r\n\r\nThe \"movements\" and the \"isms\" and the creations of fashion, of nearly\r\nall of which we have a whole series spread over a long, but none too\r\nlong a time, reflect in themselves alone the social history of our\r\nday--development of intellect and its antithesis, fashion in dress and\r\nlanguage, art and literature, craze and affectation; in short, the whole\r\nnational evolution during a quarter of a century. It is amusing to\r\nglance at some of them--a few out of the very many--and sample the\r\njournalistic wit with which Leech eyed and illustrated the passing hour.\r\n\r\nThe periodical wail of the British householder and his wife on the\r\nsubject of the great \"domestic difficulty\" gave Leech a fund of anecdote\r\nthat he was not slow to draw upon. He was himself a typical middle-class\r\nBritish householder, who liked to have everything nice and neat about\r\nhim, including the pretty, amiable, zealous, h-less maidservant in nice\r\nwhite apron and clean print-dress. He closed his eyes and ears to Sydney\r\nSmith's discovery that _all_ the virtues and most of the graces are not\r\nto be had for £7 a year. And so Leech gave us the series he entitles\r\n\"Servantgalism,\" harshly illustrative for the most part of the comic\r\nside of what a later generation calls Slaveyism. And as _Punch_, chiefly\r\nunder the influence of Thackeray, raised his eyes from Bloomsbury to\r\nBelgravia, and found equal fun and better sport in baiting the far more\r\ncontemptible airs and graces of John Thomas, \"Flunkeiana\" became a\r\nfertile field from which he drew some of his most caustic productions.\r\nHe made them the severer, too, that during the Crimean War and the\r\ndangers that threatened the land, Leech could not bear with patience the\r\nsight of \"pampered menials\" passing their time in relatively idle\r\nluxury, when they, together with linen-drapers' assistants and others\r\nengaged in what is really woman's work, ought rather to have been\r\nbearing arms, or at the very least drilling in the newly-formed force of\r\nVolunteers.\r\n\r\nYet the Volunteers had not to thank Leech for anything much but chaff\r\nduring the early years of the movement. If anything could snuff out\r\npatriotism, \"The Brook Green Volunteer,\" the laughable satire on the\r\nMilitia, would have done it, and the square into which that warrior\r\nformed himself would assuredly have been broken and dispersed. And truly\r\nthis series, famous and still appreciated as it is, lost a good deal of\r\nits force from the presence of a fault not often found in Leech's\r\nwork--grotesqueness of invention and undue exaggeration. In time Charles\r\nKeene made us forget the unintentional injustice Leech had done to a\r\nnoble movement; and as fate willed it, Mr. G. Haydon, who had greatly\r\nassisted the author of it, Sir J. C. Bucknill, became later an artistic\r\ncontributor to _Punch_ and a friend, not only of Leech, but of several\r\nof the most distinguished of the Staff.\r\n\r\nAnd after the Crimean War was over, there was a social upheaval known as\r\n\"the great beard movement.\" Leech was very keen upon all this question\r\nof moustaches, and held with many others that no one had a right to them\r\nsave the crack cavalry regiments. One day it happened that Leech,\r\nTenniel, and Pritchett were riding together, and, agreeing on the\r\nsubject, they arrived at cross-roads, where, holding their crops\r\ntogether, they cried \"We Swear!\"--not to wear hair on lip or chin. In\r\n1865 the unregenerate Mr. Pritchett went to Skye to practise\r\nwater-colour and--to let his moustaches grow! Returning in due time to\r\nTenniel's house, he said nothing, but merely opened the door, and thrust\r\nin his face with an air of defiant resignation, and waited. Tenniel\r\nstarted. \"You scoundrel!\" he exclaimed; \"_then I must!_\" And he did. But\r\nLeech was proof against this example of degeneracy, and to the end\r\nremained true to his views and his vow, although moustaches soon came\r\ninto regular fashion.\r\n\r\nYet moustache, beard, and whiskers have been a mine of fun to\r\nLeech--from the little Eton boy who tells the hairdresser, when he has\r\ncut his curls, just to give him a close shave, and who ties the major's\r\nwhisker to his sister's ringlet; to the snobs who, \"giving to hairy\r\nnothings a local habitation and a name,\" flatter themselves that their\r\nstubbly chins will get them mistaken for \"captings\" at the very least;\r\nand to the military Adonises who may boast that their silken beards and\r\nfierce moustaches lead a beauty by each single hair. One of the most\r\namusing results of Leech's drawings of whiskered swells was Sothern's\r\ncreation of \"Lord Dundreary\"--as the actor was always ready to proclaim.\r\nBut for the artist, this most comical character would have been nothing\r\nbut the ordinary stage-fool as it was at first designed, and the\r\nplaygoers of two generations would never have held their aching sides at\r\none of the most mirthful of modern _rôles_.\r\n\r\nThen the series of hearty laughs that, in 1851, accompanied his handling\r\nof \"Bloomerism\"--that parent of our modern dress reform and the divided\r\nskirt, and certainly the ancestor of the lady-bicyclist's costume (\"A\r\nskirt divided against itself cannot stand; it must sit upon a\r\nbicycle\")--served to kill the thing that the natural modesty of Leech\r\nput down as unwomanly and his æsthetic sense as hideous. And the\r\ncrinoline, to which the American invention was to afford an antidote,\r\nprovides Leech with material for a hundred humorous points of view. For\r\nit grew and grew in monstrousness and outrageous proportions until 1861,\r\nwhen it began to dwindle, and by such refuge as a \"hooped petticoat\" can\r\nafford saved its dignity as it made its welcome exit from the scene.\r\n\r\nAnd the Cochin-China Fancy, and the Table-Turning Craze (in respect to\r\nwhich Mark Lemon declared that if Hope, the spiritualist, would give a\r\nconvincing _séance_ in Whitefriars, _Punch_ would recant), and the\r\nRacecourse, and the Great Exhibition, and Horsetaming, and a score of\r\nother subjects--whether pastime or fashion or phase--were all used by\r\nLeech with unfailing humour. The Chartist period of 1848 was a great\r\nopportunity, happily seized, and some of the artist's sketches were the\r\nresult of his personal observation; for he was himself sworn in. \"Only\r\nloyalty and extreme love of peace and order made me do it,\" he said; but\r\nnone the more did he enjoy his nocturnal patrol from ten o'clock till\r\none.\r\n\r\nAnd all his types--his _dramatis personæ_, so to speak--the gent and his\r\nvulgar associates; the Greedy Boy and the Comic Drunkard; the _Enfant\r\nTerrible_, soon, it is devoutly hoped, to be packed off to school, and\r\nthe dreadful Schoolboy home for the holidays; the Choleric Old Gentleman\r\nand the comfortable Materfamilias; Miss Clara and the Heavy Dragoon; the\r\nItalian Organ-grinder, Frenchman, Irishman, and Hebrew (Leech's four\r\n_bêtes noires_); the Rising Generation; and all the rest--what a boxful\r\nof puppets they were for Mr. Punch's show! And besides them the two or\r\nthree distinct personalities he created! There was Tom Noddy--the\r\nridiculous little man who in real life was the estimable Mr. Mike\r\nHalliday, sometime clerk of the House of Lords, and latterly poet and\r\nsuccessful artist, who was as pleased as _Punch_ himself at the\r\ndistinction conferred upon him and his doings by the artist, while all\r\nthe time Leech was secretly flattering his kindly self that his model\r\ncould not by any means discover himself in pictures in which the\r\nfeatures were so carefully altered--for all personalities were hateful\r\nto the considerate, sensitive humorist. And Mr. Briggs, the Immortal! Of\r\nhim whose creation is sufficient to render the year 1849 memorable in\r\nthe annals of the land much has ere now been written--that type of a\r\nwell-to-do British householder, delightful for his follies and endearing\r\nby his pluck, something of a lunatic, it must be admitted, yet more of a\r\nsportsman, and most of all a \"muff\"--_Punch's_ \"simple-minded Philistine\r\npaterfamilias.\" Many of his adventures, especially of house-keeping and\r\nits terrors, were based upon Leech's own experiences. For it was Leech\r\nwho had those terrible builders, and who was taken for a burglar by a\r\npoliceman when trying to get in at his own window. Mr. Briggs'\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten sensations of a spill from his horse, as recorded\r\nby Leech, were the result of the artist's own bewildering experience--as\r\nhe confessed to \"Cuthbert Bede\"--and many of his adventures in\r\nsalmon-fishing, grouse and pheasant shooting, and deer-stalking were\r\nfounded on his visits to Sir John Millais in Scotland. \"All the pools on\r\nthe Stanley Water,\" says one authority, \"are sacred to the memory of\r\nBriggs, for it was Leech's favourite fishing-ground; and 'Hell's Hole,'\r\n'Death's Throat,' 'Black Stones,' and many other cuts, may all be\r\nrecognised from his humorous pictures, the originals of which are in the\r\npossession of Colonel Stuart Sandeman, the proprietor. The Stanley Water\r\nbegins below Burnmouth.\" Many of his fishing-sketches were made at\r\nWhitchurch in Hampshire, when staying with Mr. Haydon aforesaid.\r\n\r\nHalf Leech's popularity came, probably, from his sketches in the Row and\r\nin the hunting-field. Even so hearty a hater of horse-flesh as\r\nRuskin--so far as he could hate animals at all--has declared that the\r\nmost beautiful drawing in all _Punch_ is Miss Alice on her father's\r\nhorse--\"her, with three or four young Dians.\" Leech's sympathy for\r\nhorses was natural to the man, and had no little influence in toning\r\ndown those rampant ideas of Democracy and Socialism to which Thackeray\r\nreferred. In the opinion of many, not all the Conservative party,\r\nlandlords and House of Peers together, will, in the great coming\r\nstruggle with \"King Demos,\" exert against him and his Socialism a\r\nfraction of the power of resistance that will ultimately be found in the\r\nnational love of horses and of sport, whether in the hunting-field, on\r\nthe racecourse, or in the sporting column of the daily paper; and this\r\nbelief John Leech himself entertained.\r\n\r\nLeech, whose pecuniary resources were always being drained by relations\r\nother than those of his own immediate household, and on behalf of whom\r\nit is generally admitted that he worked himself to death, rode and\r\nhunted, as he said, not from extravagance, but in order that he might be\r\nfit and able to do his work. And his riding, which was a necessity to\r\nhimself, was not less indispensable to _Punch_, for a very considerable\r\namount of the Paper's support in the Country depends upon his \"horsey\r\nsketches.\" Without them English life would not be properly represented,\r\nparticularly in its most delightful and engaging of pastimes, and\r\nwithout them English support--from that prosperous class to which\r\n_Punch_ specially appeals--would hardly be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nBut, for all his love of horses and the hunting-field, Leech was not a\r\nparticularly good rider, and a friend of his tells how he laughingly\r\ninsisted on buying from him a horse that was not sound in his wind, as\r\nhe could not run away. Yet he poked good-natured fun at the riding of\r\nhis friend Sir John Millais, and once told him that as he followed him\r\nin the field he had conceived the original idea of drawing some\r\n\"triangular landscapes\" as seen through Millais' legs. He satirised\r\nhimself with equal good-temper in the drawing in which a Cockney\r\nhorseman reins up at the edge of a steep hill--you might almost call it\r\na hole--down the side of which the rest are scampering, with the words\r\n\"Oh, if this is one of the places Charley spoke of, I shall go back!\"\r\nIndeed, in spite of all his sport, he almost agreed with Hood--\r\n\r\n            \"There's something in a horse\r\n  That I can always honour, but never could _endorse_.\"\r\n\r\nYet, like his great rival \"Phiz,\" who rode with the Surrey hounds, he\r\nloved the cover-side; but as time went on, and youthful ardour cooled,\r\nhe would rather attend the meet than follow in the chase. As he favoured\r\nthe Puckeridge hounds, it comes about that most of his landscape\r\nbackgrounds are views in Hertfordshire. And when he preferred the more\r\nsober delights of the Row--not the same Row we now scamper along from\r\nHyde Park Corner, but the old one along by the Serpentine, and, for a\r\ntime, in Kensington Gardens--his tall graceful figure always attracted\r\nattention; and when he mounted his pony, which he called \"Red Mullett,\"\r\npeople who recognised him would turn and remark that Mr. Punch had come\r\nout for a ride upon dog Toby.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT SOCIAL EVIL.\r\n\r\nTIME: Midnight. A Sketch not a Hundred Miles from the Haymarket.\r\n\r\n_Bella:_ \"Ah! Fanny! How long have you been _gay_?\"\r\n\r\n(From _Punch_, 12th Sept., 1857, Vol. xxxiii.)]\r\n\r\nBut it was not by his comic faculty alone that John Leech helped to\r\nmake _Punch_ great, nor even by his political work. It was also by his\r\nfrank demonstration of that deep feeling which is often called\r\n\"passion,\" whether love, or sympathy, or hot indignation. His love of\r\nchildren, even when he laughs at them, is surpassed by few other artists\r\nor writers, even by those of Mr. Punch--that adorer of first youth and\r\ngreen-apple and salad days. The enthusiasm with which he threw himself\r\ninto all attacks upon abuses showed him a hot-blooded philanthropist. It\r\nwas not for the first time that in his \"Moral Lesson of the Gallows\" he\r\nused his Hogarthian power against the scandal and brutalising horror of\r\npublic executions. In the little \"social\" entitled \"The Great Social\r\nEvil,\" which so electrified _Punch's_ readers at the time, there appears\r\nthe hand of the reformer, perhaps; but primarily a whole heartful of\r\nwide sympathy and pathos, from which, with true instinct, the artist has\r\nbanished every suggestion of humour, retaining only with a few skilful\r\nstrokes the sad and pathetic reality of the social problem. This\r\ndrawing was made some time before, but Mark Lemon, with less courage\r\nthan he showed in the publication of the \"Song of the Shirt,\" hesitated\r\nto insert it; and it is traditionally asserted that it was at the time\r\nof the Editor's temporary absence through illness that Leech insisted\r\nupon its publication. And who can forget the contemptuous drawing of the\r\nbrutalised dancers at Mabille (1847), or the other, made in full anger\r\nand disgust at the sight of a Spanish bullfight \"with the gilt off,\"\r\nafter he had attended one, when towards his life's end he visited\r\nBiarritz for a few days in fruitless search of health? It is a terrible\r\npage, and probably touches the limit of what is permissible in art.\r\nShirley Brooks called it \"a grim indictment of a nation pretending to be\r\ncivilised;\" and in England, at least, it met with a throb of responsive\r\nemotion and of cordial approval.\r\n\r\nPassing from these things to a more pleasing one, we are struck with\r\nLeech's exceptional love of beauty. Never did Nature seem more\r\ndelightful than in his cuts--in those dainty backgrounds in which the\r\nloveliest scenery is so skilfully reproduced. \"What plump young\r\nbeauties,\" cries Thackeray, \"those are with which Mr. Punch's chief\r\ncontributor supplies the old gentleman's pictorial harem!\" It is true,\r\nthey are nearly always the same girl, this ideal of _Punch's_--short in\r\nstature, simple and pouting and laughing, with big eyes and rounded\r\nchin, with bewitching dimples and pretty ringlets; but then this ideal,\r\nthis \"little dumpling,\" was none other than Mrs. Leech! The artist had\r\nseen her in the street in 1843, had fallen head over ears in love with\r\nher upon the spot, followed her to her home, looked up the directory to\r\nascertain her name, obtained an introduction, and had straightway wooed\r\nand won her. \"Now I'll bet ten to one,\" he wrote to Percival Leigh, as\r\nsoon as he had been accepted, \"that your reverence will think me the\r\noddest person in the world, at a moment like the present, to think of\r\nwriting to a friend; but I can't help sending you a line or two to say\r\nthat I have been made a 'happy man'.... Never laugh again at the union\r\nof _2 soles_ (_i.e._, two flats); at any rate, don't expect me to join\r\nin the guffaw.\" And so Miss Annie Eaton became Mrs. John Leech, the\r\nobject of her husband's devotion and of his inspired pencil. It is true\r\nthat his young ladies and his servants are all much of the same type;\r\nbut, in spite of Mr. Henry James' curious judgment that Leech had no\r\ngreat sense of beauty, he has usually been otherwise adjudged, as in the\r\n\"poem\" by Albert Smith and Edmund Yates--assuredly in harmony with most\r\nmen's views--where he is spoken of as\r\n\r\n     \"'Handsome Jack,' to whose dear girls and swells his life _Punch_\r\n     owes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it comes about that _Punch's_ pages are eloquent with portraits\r\nof Mrs. Leech, who, with her children, became the very \"orchard\" of\r\nLeech's eye. The last block of all on which the artist was engaged was\r\none to be called \"An Afternoon on the Flags;\" it represented a\r\ncomplimentary dog-fancier comparing the points of beauty in a dog with\r\nthose of the lady before him, but it was still unfinished when he fell\r\nback in his bed, dead from the fatal breast-pang.\r\n\r\nLeech would never employ artists' models--partly because his _chic_\r\ndrawing, like Sir John Tenniel's, came natural to his genius, and his\r\nmemory was extraordinarily retentive, and partly because when he began\r\nto draw for _Punch_, and for a long while after, it was unheard-of for\r\nblack-and-white men on comic papers to do anything so seriously\r\nacademic. But though he said that he had not in his life made\r\nhalf-a-dozen drawings from Nature, he was always sketching \"bits\" for\r\nuse, and trusted to his memory and imagination for the rest. On one or\r\ntwo occasions he would ask Mrs. Hole, the wife of the Dean of Rochester,\r\nto sit for him in her riding-habit--but this was the nearest approach he\r\never made to the \"model.\" He would make his first sketch and then trace\r\nit on to the block, finishing his rapid drawing with considerable\r\ndeliberation, yet so quickly that he would often send off three drawings\r\nbefore dinner-time. He was extremely particular about the drawing, and\r\nthe engraving, too, of his boots and feet, and expressed boundless\r\nadmiration of Tenniel's power in that direction. \"Talk of drawing!\" he\r\nexclaimed to Mr. Frith; \"what is my drawing compared to Tenniel's? Look\r\nat the way that chap can draw a boot; why, I couldn't do it to save my\r\nlife!\" Like all other artists, he was constantly asked by friends what\r\npaper was the best and what pencils he used. \"H.B.,\" he would reply; \"if\r\nyou can't put it down with that, you can't put it down at all.\" His\r\nsimplicity of means matched the simplicity of his art, and both the\r\ntransparent simplicity of his character. His views relative to private\r\npersons' privacy prevented him from including portraiture in his\r\ndrawings other than that of public men. But to get these, and especially\r\nmembers of the House of Commons, he would take considerable trouble. I\r\nhave seen an extremely cordial letter addressed to him by Mr. Speaker\r\nDenison, in which special facilities were accorded him to witness the\r\nopening of Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"LEECH'S 'PRETTY GIRL.'\"\r\n(_A Skit by Sir J. E. Millais, Bart., R.A. By Permission of W. W. Fenn,\r\nEsq._)]\r\n\r\nAs a draughtsman Leech has been admirably placed by Mr. du Maurier, who\r\ncalls him a perfect ballad-writer as compared with the more scientific\r\ncounterpointing of Charles Keene. And I would remark that it was above\r\nall as a pencil and wood draughtsman that he excelled; his etchings--of\r\nwhich he made two-score for the Pocket-Books--are not, technically\r\nconsidered, up to the sustained level of either Cruikshank or \"Phiz.\"\r\nBut his sense of freedom on the block he makes us feel; he revels in it,\r\nand thereby imparts spontaneity to his drawings far beyond what we see\r\nin his plates. Yet his composition is almost uniformly excellent,\r\nwhether in line or light and shade, and apparently as carefully thought\r\nout as though an oil picture and not a _Punch_ cut was the work he had\r\nin hand. The relation between his landscapes and his figures has often\r\nbeen applauded; and a foreign critic has exclaimed, with unfeigned\r\nsurprise and admiration, \"Leech and Keene could not only draw\r\nlight--they could even draw the wind!\" And with all this he told his\r\nstory in his drawings more completely than any man of his day; he\r\nappealed to every class of society, and touched them all with equal\r\nfacility, with equal good-humour, brightness, and beauty. His power of\r\nlegend-writing, too, was remarkable--his explanatory lines beneath the\r\ndrawings being as concise and happy as what they described. Says Mr.\r\nSilver: \"As brevity is the soul of wit, he always made his 'legends' as\r\nterse as possible, first jotting them down hastily, and condensing while\r\nhe drew. I have, for instance, a slight drawing of a heavy pig-faced\r\nfarmer admiring with his wife a fat pig in its stye. Beneath the sketch\r\nis scribbled 'There now; that's my style! I call him a perfect love!' As\r\nthe joke lay in the likeness of the owner to the pig, the last phrase\r\nseemed redundant, and therefore was suppressed before the drawing went\r\nto _Punch_.\" It is curious that with this gift, he should have\r\ncontributed only once, so far as I can ascertain, to the literary\r\nportion of _Punch_, and then merely some mock \"Verses for Pantomime\r\nMusic\"--strictly speaking, for the harlequinade--(January 4th, 1845),\r\ndesigned to show the fatuous idiotcy of those compositions.\r\n\r\nContrary to what might have been expected in so prolific an artist,\r\nLeech never for a moment entertained the sentiment not unusual among\r\ncomic artists--\"je prends mon bien là où je le trouve.\" He was even\r\ndiffident about accepting a suggestion for a joke. His own observation\r\ngave him the vast majority of his \"pictures of life and character,\" but\r\nhe would occasionally accept with a quiet undemonstrative smile some of\r\nthe many proposals that were submitted to him. You might find it in\r\n_Punch_ next week, or next year; but if the giver were an artist too, he\r\nwould hesitate to make use of it, lest he might wrong a brother-pencil.\r\nHe often figures in his own cuts, as in \"The Dismay of Mr. Jessamy on\r\nbeing told that he will spoil the whole thing [private theatricals] if\r\nhe doesn't Shave off his Whiskers\" (Almanac, 1854--his own whiskers\r\nwhich he always regarded with a sort of mock-tender pride.) To his own\r\nlittle son we owe the delightful cut of the child who reminds the new\r\nnurse that he is one of those children who can only be managed by\r\nkindness, \"so please get me a cake and an orange;\" like that other\r\n_Punch_ youngster who, aping mamma, faintly asks, \"Is there such a thing\r\nas a bun in the house?\" \"Astonishingly quick Leech was,\" says Mr.\r\nSilver, \"to seize on any sight or subject that seemed to have some\r\nhumour in it. I can call to mind, for instance, how I chanced to see a\r\nchimney-sweep with his hand held to his eyes, as he was passing a\r\nstreet-door while the mat was being shaken. I told Leech of the\r\nincident; for, covered as he was with soot, the sweep seemed\r\nover-sensitive. In a very few minutes the scene was sketched most\r\nfunnily, and was then drawn on the wood. The sketch hangs in my\r\nbilliard-room, and they who please may turn to _Punch_ and see the\r\ndrawing. Another time I recollect we noticed some big buoys which were\r\njust the shape of fishing-floats, and which I said that Gulliver might\r\nhave seen so used in Brobdingnag. 'Not a bad idea,' said Leech, and he\r\nmade a hasty sketch then. Next morning the result appeared upon the\r\nwood, and soon afterwards in _Punch_, with a 'legend' which I quote from\r\nmemory only:--'I s'pose you sometimes catch some biggish fish here, eh,\r\nold Cockywax?' 'Why, yes; and them's the floats we uses; see, young\r\nCockywax'?\"\r\n\r\nFrom Millais he had many a joke; and when the two close friends were\r\nseparated, the former would send him sketches of the idea. Several of\r\nthese Leech left behind him, having only taken advantage of two--the\r\nprotection that plaid is supposed to afford in the Highlands, when the\r\nunhappy novice who puts it on wrestles with it in a high wind; and the\r\ndevice of a couple of artists for defying the Scotch midges--a comic,\r\nballoon-like envelope for the head. From Dean Hole came that immortal\r\njoke of the yokel at a great country dinner, who on tossing off his\r\nliqueur-glass of Curaçoa, the first he has ever tasted, calls to the\r\nwaiter that he'll \"tak' some o' that in a moog;\" and it was from a\r\npassage in one of the Dean's letters to the effect that in a long run he\r\nhad only had three mishaps on his promising young chestnut, that Leech\r\ninvented the drawing of \"A Contented Mind\"--wherein the mud-bespattered\r\nyoung hopeful has increased the number of falls to five. And he loved to\r\nwatch the sons of his colleague, Gilbert Abbott à Beckett--both of them\r\nin due time called to the Table--and to base upon the mischievous\r\nadventures and the characteristic invention of the young pickles many a\r\nlaughable drawing. They were the originals of the boys who, with a\r\nten-and-sixpenny box of tools and a sufficiency of nails, in the absence\r\nof their parents put the furniture of the house in a state of thorough\r\nrepair!! And on a skating experience of one of them--Mr. Arthur à\r\nBeckett--comes that well-known design of a youth at the mercy of a\r\nskate-tout at the ice-edge. \"Look out!\" he cries; \"_you_ are running the\r\ngimlet into my heel!\" \"Never mind, sir,\" responds the man, persuasively;\r\n\"_better 'ave 'em on firm!_\"\r\n\r\nFrom Charles Dickens, from Mr. Frith, Mr. Holman Hunt, and Mr. Horsley,\r\nR.A., Leech also accepted happy thoughts; and from an \"Eton boy,\" the\r\nsmart reply of a belle of a ballroom to the young Oxford man who\r\n\"couldn't get on there without women's society\"--\"Pity you don't go to\r\na girls' school, then!\" The Eton boy claimed and received remuneration,\r\nto the amount of a couple of guineas, which came out of Leech's generous\r\npocket, accompanied by a present and good counsel--a form of\r\nacknowledgment, however, which was \"not to be taken as a precedent.\"\r\nSometimes, too, Leech would re-draw or touch up sketches of good jokes\r\nsent in by outsiders; but on such occasions he, according to the usual\r\npractice of the _Punch_ men, never signed the drawing so made.\r\n\r\nThe melancholy of Leech, which probably found relief in his more\r\nsarcastic and serious drawings, was one of the predominant features of\r\nhis character. Sadness and dejection are often the birthwrong of the\r\nhumorist, as we have seen in the cases of Gillray, Seymour, André Gill,\r\nand Labiche, and many others of _Punch's_ own day. But Leech's gravity\r\nbelonged to a mind too well-balanced to overreach itself, too genuine\r\nfor false sentiment. Moreover, he \"could be a merry fellow when harmless\r\nfun was demanded.\" So says Sir John Millais, who after Thackeray, and\r\nperhaps Percival Leigh, was the friend Leech loved the best--far more\r\nthan any others of the _Punch_ Staff, cordial as his friendship with\r\nthem was. Sometimes his depression would make him think, says Dean Hole,\r\nthat he was \"wasting his time on unworthy objects and an inferior\r\nmethod,\" which was exactly what Kenny Meadows told him. It is true that\r\nthe said Bohemian had, in a soberer moment, assured him of his\r\nimmeasurable superiority to Kenny's self; but as the wine flowed, the\r\ntruth came out of it, it appeared that Meadows considered his own\r\nillustrations of Shakespeare of vastly greater account than the mere\r\ncomic sketches of young John Leech.\r\n\r\nLeech, it seemed, could be as humorous as he pleased, and as whimsical.\r\nWhen his children misbehaved, he would correct them by making a sketch\r\nof their \"naughty faces;\" and he was always ready to turn a joke upon\r\nhimself. He made merciless fun of sea-sickness--yet what is there so\r\ncomic in sea-sickness, after all, that we always laugh at it, just as we\r\nlaugh at the toothache, which George Cruikshank was so fond of\r\ncaricaturing?--the suffering, in both cases awful beyond the power of\r\nwords to express. One would almost be led to believe that Leech shared\r\nthe immunity of the robust scoffers whom one usually sees behind a big\r\ncigar on board the yacht or steamboat. Yet when he crossed to Boulogne\r\non a visit to Dickens, and was received with uproarious applause from\r\nwhat Americans call the \"side-walk committee,\" by reason of his superior\r\ngreenness and more abject misery, he was quite pleased, and said with\r\nthe utmost gratification that he felt he had made a great hit. His\r\ncompanionship with Dickens was frequent; and when, in 1848, he was\r\noverthrown by a wave while bathing at Bonchurch, and received a slight\r\nconcussion of the brain, the novelist rendered him the greatest medical\r\nservice. On that occasion and the week after the cartoons were executed\r\nby Doyle and Newman respectively, while Thackeray filled the space\r\nusually occupied by Leech's smaller cuts.\r\n\r\nHis prejudices were to some extent the prejudices of Thackeray. That he\r\nshould have shared Gilbert à Beckett's dislike of Jews was perhaps to be\r\naccounted for by his having in his youth been detained on two occasions\r\nin \"sponging-houses,\" though through no fault of his own; and visiting\r\nthe sins of the lowest upon the whole race, as is the orthodox practice,\r\nhe displayed towards them something of Alonzo Cano's ill-will and more\r\nthan his power of ill-doing. Similarly, towards Irishmen and Frenchmen\r\nhe showed the same hearty prejudice, not untinged, perhaps, with\r\npatriotism; and of that Thackeray was led to write: \"We trace in his\r\nwork a prejudice against the Hebrew nation, against the natives of an\r\nisland much celebrated for its verdure and its wrongs. These are\r\nlamentable prejudices, indeed; but what man is without his own?\" Yet\r\nthey were honestly entertained, and acted upon according to the lights\r\nof _Punch_ which at that time were full aflame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN LEECH'S HOUSE, KENSINGTON HIGH STREET (NOW\r\nDEMOLISHED).\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by John Fulleylove, R.I._)]\r\n\r\nBut these playful dislikes paled beside the hatred he bore to\r\norgan-grinders--a hatred as unrelenting as the organ-grinders\r\nthemselves. For this he had only too sound a reason, for it was they\r\nwho, grinding his overworked nerves, were destined literally to play him\r\ninto his grave. As early as 1843 he began his campaign against them in\r\n_Punch_, and he never relaxed it until his death. Morbidly timid of all\r\nnoise, he loved to stay at some quiet English seaside place, \"where the\r\ndoor-knockers were dieted to three raps a day;\" but he writhed most\r\nunder the sound of the organ, and not Hogarth's Enraged Musician endured\r\nhalf the torture that Leech suffered in physical and nervous agony. He\r\nappealed with his pencil to the law; he ridiculed the barbarous persons,\r\nsuch as Lord Wilton, who \"rather liked it;\" he portrayed the effect of\r\nthese tyrants of the street upon the sick and on the worker; and he\r\nnever spared the offenders themselves. Once, indeed, he was goaded into\r\nshowing one of these dirty persons leading a louse, like a monkey, by a\r\nstring; but after a few copies had been struck off (and included in the\r\nparcel for Scotland), the printing-press was stopped, and the \"realism\"\r\nwas cut from the block. From the first contribution, in which an old\r\nlady was supposed to advertise for a professor of mesmerism--a discovery\r\nmuch talked about at that time--in order to mesmerise all the organs in\r\nher street, at so much per organ, down to the end, some scores of\r\ndrawings were directed against his unnatural enemy, who literally drove\r\nhim from house to house. Even when he took final refuge at his\r\ndelightful residence, 6 The Terrace, Kensington--now, alas! removed to\r\nmake way for showy shops--and fitted it with double windows, he still\r\ncould get no rest. Standing with Mr. Silver under the tree beneath whose\r\nshade Thackeray, Keene, and Leech loved to foregather round his _al\r\nfresco_ dinner-table, I have hearkened to the pretty clink, clink,\r\nclink, of a far-distant smith as he smote his hammer upon the anvil,\r\nand, wondering that so sweet a sound could trouble any man, I have\r\nrealised how shattered must have been the sufferer's nervous system as\r\nhe neared his end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ASH-TREE IN THE GARDEN OF JOHN LEECH'S HOUSE, UNDER\r\nWHICH LEECH AND THACKERAY USED TO DINE.\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by John Fulleylove, R.I._)]\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. M. T. Bass, M.P., brought in his private Bill to regulate\r\n\"street music,\" Mark Lemon sent him an eloquent letter of support, in\r\nwhich he touchingly dwelt on the torments suffered by his friend. \"The\r\neffect,\" he wrote, \"upon his health--produced, on my honour, by the\r\ncauses I have named--is so serious that he is forbidden to take horse\r\nexercise, or indulge in fast walking, as a palpitation of the heart has\r\nbeen produced--a form of _angina pectoris_, I believe--and his friends\r\nare most anxiously concerned for his safety. He is ordered to Homburg,\r\nand I know that the expatriation will entail a loss of nearly £50 a\r\nweek upon him just at present. I am sure I need not withhold from you\r\nthe name of this poor gentleman--it is Mr. John Leech.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO ROSES.\r\n\r\n(_From a Sketch for \"Punch\" by John Leech._)]\r\n\r\nThe artist only survived this appeal for half a year, and died before he\r\ncould enjoy any relief from Mr. Bass's meagre Bill. But the public was\r\nloud in denunciation of the nuisance when they learned that he who had\r\nmade their lives so much merrier for a quarter of a century had been\r\nharassed into the grave. \"Carlyle,\" wrote Mr. Moncure Conway, \"who\r\nsuffered from the same fraternity, mingled with his sorrow for Leech\r\nsome severe sermons against that kind of liberty which 'permitted\r\nItalian foreigners to invade London and kill John Leech, and no doubt\r\nhundreds of other nervous people who die and make no sign!'\" Leech's\r\nlast drawing appears on p. 188 (November 5th, 1864), in which an\r\nIrishman is shown thoroughly enjoying the after-effects of a fight,\r\nhis face having been pummelled out of all recognition. It is full of\r\nfun and life and spirit, and gives no hint that he who drew it would\r\ndelight the world no more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY LORD BROUGHAM AS SEEN AT MR. LUMLEY'S.\r\n\r\n(_From a Sketch by John Leech. By Permission of Henry Silver, Esq._)]\r\n\r\nAnd when the news went forth that John Leech was dead, a hush seemed to\r\nfall on the country, as it had done ten months before, when Thackeray\r\ndied, and as it did again a few years after, on the death of Dickens.\r\nThe three men all died sudden deaths, and Leech felt and declared that\r\nThackeray's was the knell of his own. \"I saw the remains of the poor\r\ndear fellow,\" he said, \"and, I assure you, I can hardly get over it. A\r\nhappy or merry Christmas is out of the question.\" What wonder, then,\r\nthat on hearing that Leech had followed, Mrs. Thackeray Ritchie should\r\nhave exclaimed, \"How happy my father will be to meet him!\"\r\n\r\n\"I fancy Thackeray was tired of life,\" said Leech in his deep bass voice\r\nto his _Punch_ colleague Mr. Henry Silver. \"At these words I wondered\r\nmuch,\" says the latter gentleman, \"as any young man might who failed to\r\nsee beneath the surface of a loved and prospering life. 'I feel somehow\r\nI sha'n't survive him long,' he added rather wearily; 'and I shouldn't\r\nmuch care either, if it were not for my family.' Then, after a pause, he\r\nsaid more cheerfully, 'But I can do some work yet. And at any rate,\r\nthank Heaven! they needn't send the hat round.'\" But they _had_ need,\r\nand they did. After his death _Punch_ made sturdy, repeated, and\r\nsuccessful efforts, not only to collect a fund for the artist's family,\r\nbut also to make known the facts of his death-sale.\r\n\r\n_Punch's_ tribute to his mighty servant befitted the occasion: \"The\r\nsimplest words are best where all words are vain. Ten days ago a great\r\nartist in the noon of life, and with his glorious mental faculties in\r\nfull power, but with the shade of physical infirmity darkening upon him,\r\ntook his accustomed place among friends who have this day held his pall.\r\nSome of them had been fellow-workers with him for a quarter of a\r\ncentury, others for fewer years; but to know him well was to love him\r\ndearly, and all in whose name these lines are written mourn for him as a\r\nbrother. His monument is in the volumes of which this is one sad leaf,\r\nand in a hundred works which, at this hour, few will not remember more\r\neasily than those who have just left his grave. While Society, whose\r\nevery phase he has illustrated with a truth, a grace, and a tenderness\r\nheretofore unknown to satiric art, gladly and proudly takes charge of\r\nhis fame, they, whose pride in the genius of a great associate was\r\nequalled by their affection for an attached friend, would leave on\r\nrecord that they have known no kindlier, more refined, or more generous\r\nnature than that of him who has been thus early called to his rest.\"\r\n\r\nHe was taken to the cemetery in the same hearse that had carried Douglas\r\nJerrold to his last abode. Mark Lemon, Shirley Brooks, Tom Taylor,\r\nHorace Mayhew, F. M. Evans, John Tenniel, Henry Silver, F. C. Burnand,\r\nJ. E. Millais, and Samuel Lucas were the pall-bearers; around his grave,\r\nclose to where Thackeray lay, stood the whole _Punch_ Staff and many\r\nfriends who loved him; and Dean Hole completed the Burial Service in sad\r\nand broken tones.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] See _Punch_, p. 237, Vol. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n_PUNCH'S_ ARTISTS: 1841-50.\r\n\r\n     William Harvey--Mr. Birket Foster--Kenny Meadows--His\r\n     Joviality--Alfred \"Crowquill\"--Sir John Gilbert--Exit\r\n     \"Rubens\"--Hablôt Knight Browne (\"Phiz\")--Henry Heath--Mr. R.

Of the first-named, nothing need\r\nbe said, but that he contributed a single sketch and no more. William\r\nHarvey, however, stands on a different footing, yet his employment on\r\n_Punch_ is inexplicable. He had no real humour, and, what is perhaps\r\nmore to his credit, he pretended to none; nor did he take pains, as so\r\nmany do, to prove it. Kenny Meadows, we are told, used to rally him on\r\nhis excessive sense of gracefulness, which stood in the way of anything\r\nlike truthful representation. \"Beauty,\" he would say, \"is Harvey's evil\r\ngenius, and grace his damnation.\" It hardly required the couple of\r\ninitials (\"A\" and \"E\" on pp. 144 and 146 of the first vol.), conceived\r\nand carried out in the Birket Foster manner, with landscape backgrounds\r\nand field-sport symbols, to prove that Nature had not intended the\r\nartist for a _Punch_ draughtsman. He was far better fitted for the\r\nillustration of \"Knight's Pictorial Shakespeare\" than for comic\r\ndraughtsmanship. And when he had spread consternation in the office by\r\nsending in a charge of twelve guineas for the third wrapper, which he\r\nhad been commissioned to design--money never being scarcer than at that\r\nmoment--the proprietors immediately became equally convinced that such\r\nwas not his vocation, and his connection with the paper ceased\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\nI said he drew \"in the Birket Foster manner,\" for that young\r\ndraughtsman, who was at the time one of Landells' apprentices, had\r\nalready begun to draw initials on p. 85 of _Punch's_ first volume--an\r\n\"O,\" consisting of a laurel wreath with a Lifeguardsman charging\r\nthrough. These initials--there were thirteen in 1841, eleven in the\r\nfollowing year, and two in 1843--were remarkable work for a boy of\r\nseventeen; and still more remarkable was the fact that he should be\r\nentrusted, even at a pinch, with the execution of a cartoon. It is true\r\nthat this was only an adaptation of Cruikshank's plate of \"Jack Sheppard\r\ncutting his name on the Beam\"--a design highly appreciated at a moment\r\nwhen the fortunes of Harrison Ainsworth's young housebreaker were being\r\nfollowed with breathless interest by every section of society; and it is\r\nnot less a fact that the head of Lord John Russell was touched up by\r\nHenning. Still the achievement is as remarkable as coming from an artist\r\nof Mr. Birket Foster's temperament, as those other cartoons, executed in\r\n\"The Censor\" at a later period, by Professor Herkomer. But this was not\r\nall he did, for to him are to be credited also a few miscellaneous\r\nillustrations, as well as those extremely French-looking designs which\r\nhe imitated, by order, from drawings by Gavarni for a novelette by\r\nLecourt (pp. 262, 263 and 275, Vol. I.). As an artist he was entirely\r\nuntaught, save for Brine's quaint advice, and for the counsel of\r\nCrowquill that in figure-drawing he should make dots first for the head\r\nand chief joints, as an assistance. For a time he followed these strange\r\nindications on the royal road to drawing, and on them, perhaps, he based\r\nto some extent the illustrations which he made for book-covers, together\r\nwith Charles Keene, for Mr. Edmund Evans--who, it may not be out of\r\nplace here to repeat, now so well known as the engraver and publisher of\r\nMiss Kate Greenaway's picture books, was a fellow-pupil of Birket\r\nFoster's with \"Daddy\" Landells. He, too, made a couple of drawings for\r\n_Punch_ in 1842, when he was no more than sixteen: the first a\r\n\"blackie,\" entitled \"Train'd Animals\"--representing a trainful of wild\r\nbeasts (p. 108, Vol. III.), and the other an initial; and his name\r\nappears as well as the engraver of one of \"Phiz's\" designs in \"Punch's\r\nValentines.\" It occurred to him a little later on to buy up \"remainders\"\r\nof unsaleable novels, to employ clever artists to illustrate some\r\nstirring scene of love, adventure, or revenge, and with this design on\r\nthe boards to place the book for sale on the railway bookstalls. His\r\nshrewdness met with a rich reward; the picture sold the book; and it\r\noften happened that a book that had failed egregiously on its first\r\nappearance, would run into two or three editions when presented as a\r\nrailway novel with a cover sufficiently startling or absorbing in its\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nAn unprecedented, and an unrepeated, incident occurred in 1842. In that\r\nyear there appeared a number of drawings by Gavarni (apart from those\r\nre-drawn by Mr. Birket Foster), and something has been made by\r\ncommentators of the early enterprise of the Editor in inviting the\r\ncontributions of the eminent French master of caricature. But as a\r\nmatter of fact Gavarni was not invited at all, nor did he ever draw for\r\n_Punch_. These blocks, and the one by Gagniet, had simply been bought up\r\nby the publishers, and used after they had appeared in \"Les Parisiens\r\npeints par Eux-Mêmes\" as well as in the English translation of 1840. The\r\nuse of _clichés_, it should be stated, has never since been resorted to.\r\nWhen Gavarni did make a prudence-visit to England in 1847 he held aloof\r\nfrom _Punch_, perhaps on account of his former connection with \"The\r\nGreat Gun.\" His principal achievement here was to offend the Queen,\r\nThackeray, Dickens, and others, by coolly ignoring their proffered\r\nhospitality and friendly advances.\r\n\r\nIn this same volume first appeared a notable quintet--Kenny Meadows,\r\nAlfred \"Crowquill,\" W. M. Thackeray, Sir John Gilbert, and \"Phiz\"\r\n(Hablôt Knight Browne).\r\n\r\nFew men of his day enjoyed so great a vogue as Kenny Meadows. His pencil\r\nwas for many years in extraordinary demand; and although as an artist he\r\ncould not stand against his great contemporary George Cruikshank, his\r\npopularity--among publishers, at least--if not as great, was nearly as\r\nextensive. His work is more than half forgotten now, but the memory of\r\nhis name survives; and to speak of \"Kenny Meadows\" is to recall the\r\ntypical art of the illustrator and (such as it was) of the comic\r\ndraughtsman of the first half of the century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KENNY MEADOWS.\r\n\r\n(_From a Water-Colour by Mrs. L. Bentley Smith._)]\r\n\r\nKenny Meadows--he dropped the preliminary \"Joseph\" for reasons of\r\n\"professional distinction\"--had first met Douglas Jerrold, in company\r\nwith Laman Blanchard, in Duncombe's shop, as early as 1828, and in due\r\ntime was employed to illustrate \"Heads of the People,\" which Jerrold\r\nedited in 1840, and for which he had secured the co-operation of\r\nThackeray, Leigh Hunt, Samuel Lover, William Howitt, and other literary\r\nlights. Henry Vizetelly, who knew Meadows well, wrote to me but a few\r\nmonths before his death of his acquaintance with the artist. \"He was,\"\r\nsaid he, \"witty and epigrammatic in conversation. He was a singularly\r\nincorrect and feeble draughtsman, but abounded with clever and often\r\nhighly poetic ideas. Like most of the members of the Mulberry and\r\nShakespeare Clubs, he knew all the principal passages in Shakespeare by\r\nheart long before he became an illustrator of the plays. Like many\r\nartists and literary men of the period, he was always in financial\r\nstraits. Every sixpence that he earned he handed over to his wife, a\r\nquiet thriftful woman, sister of Archibald Henning, and she used to give\r\nhim a small sum whenever he spent his evenings abroad in company with\r\nMacready, Laman Blanchard, John Forster, Jerrold, and others, at the\r\nShakespeare Club. He was a little man with a feeble frame, and much\r\naddicted to convivial society.\" He was, indeed, a boon-companion,\r\ngenerous and kind-hearted, and a delightful _raconteur_--\"happy,\r\nconversational Meadows,\" as Blanchard Jerrold calls him--when at the\r\nclub, and a jovial roystering Bohemian when he left it.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that _Punch_ was started, Kenny Meadows was living hard\r\nby College Place, Camden Town, and one night gave a rollicking dinner to\r\nthe members of the newly-formed Staff; but Hine (from whom I had the\r\nstory), as a sober man of peace and quiet, declined the invitation, as\r\nwas his wont, and the next day, meeting Meadows, was surprised to\r\nreceive a very penitent apology for their behaviour of the previous\r\nnight. \"What behaviour?\" asked Mr. Hine, unconscious of any possible\r\ncause of offence. \"What! didn't you hear us? Where do you sleep?\" \"In\r\nfront. Why?\" \"Why? Because before breaking up at three this morning we\r\nsaid, 'Let's give Hine three cheers to finish up with;' which we did,\r\nwith an unearthly noise, and danced a solemn dance on the pavement, and\r\nsang you songs _fortissimo_, and altogether made a diabolical uproar.\"\r\n\"Never heard a sound,\" said Hine. Meadows turned sorrowfully on his heel\r\nwithout a word, and for some days could not get over his disappointment\r\nthat, in spite of all their best endeavours, his young friend's rest had\r\nbeen unbroken.\r\n\r\nWhen his first two drawings appeared in \"Punch's Valentines\"--\"Young\r\nLoves to Sell\" and \"The Speculative Mamma\"--Meadows was already\r\nfifty-one years old, with thirty-four more of conviviality before him;\r\nhe was, therefore, the Nestor of _Punch's_ Staff, as well as its most\r\ndistinguished member. \"Meadows was essentially valuable to _Punch_,\"\r\nsays George Hodder, who by marriage had become his nephew, \"for the\r\nthoughtfulness of his designs, which were intended to portray something\r\nmore than a burlesque view of a current event or a popular abuse.\" His\r\ndelight when he made a hit was like that of a prize-winning boy; and he\r\nused to pride himself that his drawing of a butterfly at the mouth of a\r\ncannon, typifying peace--published in _Punch_ in February,\r\n1844--inspired Landseer with his celebrated picture entitled \"Peace,\" in\r\nwhich, however, the butterfly was superseded by a lamb.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was excellent as a \"general utility\" man, who took as\r\nnaturally to tragedy as he did to farce, to subjects of squalor as to\r\ngrace of beauty, to Shakespeare as to _Punch_, he is not to be credited\r\nwith any great sense of humour, his _vis comica_ running rather to\r\ngrotesqueness than to real fun or wit. His intention was usually more\r\nadmired than his achievement--in his press work, at least; and the\r\nsymbolic treatment of his subjects in certain of the cartoons which he\r\nexecuted in 1842-3-4, such as his \"Temperance Guy Fawkes,\" his\r\nCruikshankian \"Gin Drop\" and \"Water Drop,\" \"The Irish Frankenstein,\" and\r\n\"The Bull Frog,\" are to be included among _Punch's_ early successes. But\r\nbetter than this sort of design he enjoyed work of a more decorative\r\ntype, in which grace and humour, as he understood them, might be\r\nintroduced. Of this class is his wrapper used throughout the fifth\r\nvolume. (_See_ p. 46.) But his \"poetic fancy and inventive genius,\"\r\nwhich aroused the enthusiasm of many others besides the appreciative\r\nJohn Timbs, were not in harmony with _Punch's_ character, nor was his\r\nfun sufficiently pointed and robust. Whilst he remained he illustrated\r\nJerrold's \"Punch's Letters to his Son\" and \"Complete Letter-writer,\"\r\nwhich duly received the honour of a reprint; but he left in 1844, and\r\nstraightway betook himself to the hostile camp of \"The Great Gun,\" which\r\naspired to be _Punch's_ chief rival, to \"The Man in the Moon,\" and other\r\nof the Jester's numerous thorns--for of such is the spirit of\r\ncaricaturists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALFRED \"CROWQUILL.\"\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph by Clarkington and Co._)]\r\n\r\nThe period of Alfred \"Crowquill's\" work corresponded with that of\r\nMeadows. Although a versatile man, using his pen and pencil with equal\r\nfacility and ability--the former, perhaps, more successfully than the\r\nlatter--Forrester (for that was his real name) was but an indifferent\r\nhumorist. He was of those who thought that fun could be imparted to a\r\ndrawing by the simple expedient of grotesque exaggeration of expression;\r\nand as a great admirer of Seymour's \"Cockney humour,\" he was frequently\r\npointless and stilted. Personally he was highly popular with the Staff,\r\nfor he was philosophically happy and jovial, and sang good songs, and\r\nwas, moreover, greatly sought after at a time when comic artists were\r\nfew. He was cartoonist, too, in a small way, in the second, third, and\r\nfourth volumes of _Punch_; but his chief merit lay in his _jeux de\r\nmots_, for he was a good punster. Yet even his pictorial puns, good as\r\nthey were, constituted little claim on a paper which was steadily\r\nimproving its Staff; and when he left, in 1844, his place was easily and\r\nadvantageously filled.\r\n\r\nPassing over the name of Thackeray, who takes his place among the\r\nliterary contributors, we come to Sir John Gilbert. His work, though\r\nslight, has spread over a longer period than that of any other _Punch_\r\nartist--save Sir John Tenniel, forty years later. His first contribution\r\nwas the frontispiece to the second volume for 1842, which also\r\nconstituted its wrapper, and was used as such for the monthly parts for\r\nmany years. He continued with a few drawings to \"The Natural History of\r\nCourtship\" and \"Punch's Letters to his Son,\" but his most ambitious\r\neffort was that representing the late Duke of Cambridge, coronet in\r\nhand, begging for public money as a marriage portion for his daughter.\r\nBut when Jerrold's fiat went forth, \"We don't want Rubens on _Punch_\"\r\nyoung Gilbert turned his attention to the newly-started \"Illustrated\r\nLondon News,\" on which his services were warmly welcomed and\r\ncontinuously employed, with such brilliant results to itself and to the\r\nblack-and-white art in England. I was one day conversing with a\r\ndistinguished foreign artist on the comparative merits of Gilbert and\r\nDoré, whose fecundity in their art was equal, and I ventured to assert\r\nthe great artistic superiority of Gilbert. \"You are right!\" cried my\r\nenthusiastic friend, with more judgment of art than accuracy of English\r\nidiom; \"Gilbert cocks Doré into a top-hat!\"\r\n\r\nNot for twenty-one years did he reappear in the pages of the London\r\nCharivari, until after an interval in which he built up his reputation\r\nas the greatest draughtsman on wood that England, and perhaps any\r\ncountry, has produced. Then he contributed the first illustration, in an\r\nadmirable spirit of caricature, to Mr. Burnand's \"Mokeanna,\" and then\r\nagain, after another nineteen years, he made a full-page drawing for\r\nthe Almanac of 1882, representing the unhappy plight of a knight who,\r\nsummoned hastily to the wars, cannot induce his new suit of armour to\r\ncome together over his fattened frame, even with the combined assistance\r\nof female relations and muscular retainers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HABLÔT K. BROWNE.]\r\n\r\nIn this same year of 1842 Hablôt Knight Browne, overcoming his former\r\nreluctance, began to draw for the paper. He drew its second wrapper\r\n(_see_ p. 42)--an enormous improvement on Henning's--as well as some\r\nbeautiful little comic cuts exquisitely engraved (used to illustrate \"A\r\nShillingsworth of Nonsense\"), and a couple of \"Punch's Valentines.\" In\r\none of these--the Lawyer--the original of Mr. Squeers may be seen in the\r\ncharacter of an orthodox pettifogging attorney perched upon a stool. But\r\n_Punch_ could not support such twin stars as Leech and \"Phiz,\" and the\r\nlatter left in 1844 for \"The Great Gun,\" whose leading draughtsman he\r\nbecame. In the pages of \"The Great Gun\" he illustrated Maxwell's\r\n\"Memoirs of a London Latch-key;\" and then, in 1850, he drew for \"Life,\r\nthe Mirror of the Million.\" In the _Punch_ volumes for 1842, 1844, and\r\n1852, his hand may be traced; and again in 1861, after his great\r\nillness, he turned once more to _Punch_. The brave worker, who would not\r\nadmit his stroke of paralysis, but called it rheumatism, could still\r\ndraw when the pencil was tied to his fingers and answered the swaying of\r\nhis body. In 1861 are eleven of his sketches--initials, most of them; in\r\n1862, but one or two; in the following year, sixteen; in 1864, eleven;\r\nin 1865, five; and again in 1866, 1867, 1868, seven cuts, and one in\r\n1869; altogether, a little over three-score drawings, besides three\r\nfull-page cuts in the Pocket-book of 1850. But, for all that, \"Phiz\"\r\ndied more than half forgotten. His biographer, indeed, had never heard\r\nof his _Punch_ work; and even the paper which had been so kind to him,\r\nand dedicated on July 22nd, 1882, two graceful obituary stanzas to\r\n\"delightful Phiz--immortal Phiz,\" entirely forgot to mention that his\r\nfacile pencil had been employed in _Punch's_ service.\r\n\r\nA single cartoon came from Henry Heath (Vol. III.), who was well enough\r\nknown as a political caricaturist through having made many such plates\r\nfor Spooner, the publisher, in the Strand. Heath emigrated to Australia,\r\nand Mr. R. J. Hamerton, who was soon to become a notable member of the\r\n_Punch_ corps, filled the place he left, signing his \"B. H.\" (Bob\r\nHamerton) to resemble as closely as might be the initials of the old\r\nfavourite. But when, later on, _Punch_ work came to Mr. Hamerton, the\r\nSpooner caricatures were dropped. A couple of unimportant contributions\r\nsent in under the initials \"J. R.\" complete the record for 1842.\r\n\r\nIt was through Jerrold's and Lemon's friend, Joe Allen, to whom he\r\nhanded some of his pen-and-ink drawings, that Mr. R. J. Hamerton secured\r\nhis footing on _Punch_. This was in the middle of the year, and in the\r\nopening number of the new volume appear his first contributions. For\r\nsome weeks they were signed \"Shallaballa\"--the itinerant Punch's first\r\ncry on his jumping up before the public in his show, and apparently an\r\nappropriate pseudonym; but when the artist was reminded by Mark Lemon of\r\nthe real significance of the objectionable word, he abandoned it for the\r\nbetter-known picture-rebus of his name--a Hammer on the side of a Tun.\r\n\r\nThe only meeting of the _Punch_ men which he attended was that at the\r\n\"Whistling Oyster,\" next door to the \"Crown,\" at the time when the\r\nmusical bivalve, as narrated in the description of the \"Punch Club,\" was\r\nthe talk of the town. Mr. Hamerton, who was introduced by Mark Lemon,\r\nand who made the fantastic portrait of it which was published in the\r\nfollowing number of _Punch_, remembers Douglas Jerrold reciting on that\r\noccasion his version of the ingredients and constitution of _Punch_,\r\nwhich was worked up and contributed by Horace Mayhew to the next volume,\r\nbut, of course, without the names attached, as here given:--\r\n\r\n  The Spirit is \"The Comic Blackstone\"      (Gilbert à Beckett).\r\n\r\n  The Acid is \"The Story of a Feather\"      (Douglas Jerrold).\r\n\r\n  The Sweet is The Great \"Saxon Suggestor\"  (W. M. Thackeray).\r\n\r\n  The Spice is \"The Sub\"                    (Horace Mayhew).\r\n\r\n  The Water is The \"Professor\"              (Percival Leigh).\r\n\r\n  And the Spoon is The \"Editor\"             (Mark Lemon).\r\n\r\nWhere, then, was the art?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R. J. HAMERTON.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph by E. Higgins, Stamford._)]\r\n\r\nMr. Hamerton was one of the few Irishmen who have worked on the paper.\r\nHe had begun to teach drawing at a school in Co. Longford when he was\r\nbut fourteen, and came to London to draw upon stone under the eye of\r\nCharles Hullmandel, the father of the lithographic art in England. With\r\nthe exception of occasional incursions into oil and water colour--he was\r\na popular member of the British Artists half-a-century ago--and a few\r\nyears' book-illustration for the London publishers, \"it was stone,\r\nstone, stone, till 1891, when the drawing on the huge stones became too\r\nmuch for my old back.\" Like his life-long friend and contemporary, Hine,\r\nhe was not of _Punch_ Punchy--at least, in respect to conviviality; and\r\nafter a record of Staff service extending to 1844, with fitful\r\ncontributions up to 1848, he deserted the precincts of Whitefriars, and\r\nsoon after renounced wood-drawing in favour of his more lucrative\r\nemployment. He had, however, already contributed ten cartoons--striking\r\nfor their handling, if not at first for their finish. The majority of\r\nhis subjects were Irish--such as the \"Irish Ogre Fattening on the\r\n'Finest Pisintry,'\" \"The Shadow Dance,\" \"King O'Connell at Tara,\"\r\n\"Bagging the Wild Irish Goose,\" and so forth--and terribly severe he\r\nwas, as only an Irishman could be, on Daniel O'Connell and Lord\r\nBrougham. He illustrated à Beckett's \"Comic Blackstone;\" but his\r\nmasterpiece in wood-draughtsmanship was his illustration of John\r\nForster's \"Life of Goldsmith\" for Bradbury and Evans. Then after a\r\ncouple of contributions from \"W. B.\"--W. Brown, whose \"Comic Album\" was\r\ndeservedly popular in its day, and whose \"Statue to Jenkins\" pleased\r\n_Punch's_ readers greatly--and the cut signed \"B,\" attributed to Thomas\r\nHood, and another anonymous contribution by \"S,\" there came Richard\r\nDoyle, one of the most notable acquisitions of the decade. He was the\r\nsecond son of the famous \"[HB],\" and had done capital comic work of an\r\namateur character while still a boy. His \"Comic English Histories,\"\r\nexecuted when he was only fifteen years of age, were published after his\r\ndeath; but he was still young when he first became known to the public.\r\nHe was possessed of an extraordinary power of fanciful draughtsmanship;\r\nand his precocity is sufficiently proved by his comic illustrations to\r\nHomer, wrought at the tender age of twelve, with real humour, wealth of\r\ninvention, and excellence of expression. His uncle, Mr. Conan, dramatic\r\ncritic of the \"Morning Herald,\" showed his work to his friend Mark\r\nLemon, and Lemon forthwith requested Mr. Swain to instruct the youth in\r\nwood-draughtsmanship. So the engraver set forth with blocks and pencils\r\nto this \"certain clever young son\" of the once mighty \"HB,\" who was now\r\nin a fair way of falling out of public notice. Arrived at Cambridge\r\nTerrace, he endeavoured to impart to Richard Doyle the art and mystery\r\nof drawing on the wood--how to prepare his blocks, and so forth, and to\r\ngive such further information as might be required. But so nervous was\r\nthe youth, who was small and thin in person, and greatly agitated in\r\nmind and manner, that he persisted in keeping his distance out of simple\r\nshyness, and literally dodged around the dining-room table, altogether\r\ntoo excited to lend the slightest attention to the words of his mentor.\r\nIn due course, Mr. Swain tells me, the first drawing was delivered, \"and\r\na bad, smudgy thing it was, too, altogether different from the work he\r\nalmost immediately contributed for the Almanac of that year.\" Doyle's\r\nfirst work in _Punch_ consisted of the clever comic borders to the\r\nChristmas number, one of which enclosed Hood's \"Song of the Shirt;\" but\r\nwith the illustration to the rhymed version of \"Don Pasquale\" he made\r\nhis actual début.\r\n\r\nHe was not promoted at once to the position of cartoonist; for the first\r\nsix months he contributed only one big cut to five of Leech's, and his\r\nproportion during several years that followed did not exceed one in\r\nthree. His first cartoon, entitled \"The Modern Sisyphus\"--representing\r\nSir Robert Peel, as the tormented one, engaged in rolling the stone\r\n(O'Connell) up the hill, with Lord John Russell and others, as the\r\nFuries, looking on--appeared on March 16th, 1844; and from that time\r\nonwards his work rapidly increased in volume. His initial-letters--an\r\ninvention further developed later on by C. H. Bennett, Mr. Ernest\r\nGriset, and Mr. Linley Sambourne--and his cartoons were reinforced by\r\nthe famous series of \"Brown, Jones, and Robinson,\" \"Mr. Pips hys Diary,\"\r\n\"Bird's-eye Views of English Society,\" and \"Ye Manners and Customs of Ye\r\nEnglyshe,\" their manner of presentation having been created by the\r\nartist, who was forthwith dubbed by his comrades \"Professor of Mediæval\r\nDesign.\" When Doyle was first called to the Table, his punctilious\r\nfather did not show any enthusiasm, being in some doubts, apparently, as\r\nto the supposed wild recklessness of those savage orgies. He wrote to\r\nthe Proprietors, hoping that they would not insist upon it for a time,\r\nas his son's health was not robust. A little later Doyle himself wrote\r\nstiffly to protest against his real name having been printed on the\r\ncover of _Punch_ contrary to his distinct request to Mark Lemon, who had\r\npromised to retain the name by which he was already known to the\r\npublic--\"Dick Kitcat\"--as in the etched plates to Maxwell's \"Hector\r\nO'Halloran.\" But the demand was not persisted in.\r\n\r\n\"Dicky\" Doyle continued to work regularly for the paper, and his\r\nmonogram signature, with a \"dicky\" either perched upon the top or\r\npecking on the ground close by, was rarely absent from a single number,\r\nwhen the Popery scare--which had seized the popular mind towards the end\r\nof 1849--infected _Punch_ with extraordinary virulence. So long as Mark\r\nLemon confined his cartoons and his text to the general question of\r\n\"Papal Aggression,\" Doyle, who was a devout Irish Catholic, held his\r\npeace; but when the very doctrine of the faith was attacked, and the\r\nPope himself personally insulted, he severed himself regretfully but\r\ndeterminedly from the paper. Anterior to this, Doyle had remonstrated,\r\nbut had been reminded that he himself had been permitted to caricature\r\nExeter Hall and all its ways, so that he could not complain if the\r\ntables were turned upon his own party. Jerrold and Thackeray, says Mr.\r\nEveritt, sought to dissuade him in vain. \"Look at the 'Times,'\" they\r\nargued; \"its language has been most violent, but the Catholic writers on\r\nits Staff do not, for that reason, resign. They understand, and the\r\nworld at large understands, that the individual contributor is not\r\nresponsible for the opinions expressed by other contributors in articles\r\nwith which they have nothing to do.' 'That is all very well in the\r\n\"Times,\"' was Doyle's answer, 'but not in _Punch_. For the \"Times\" is a\r\nmonarchy [I believe, these were his very words], whereas _Punch_ is a\r\nrepublic.' So when a week or so later an article, attributed to Jerrold\r\nhimself, jeeringly advised the Pope to 'feed his flock on the wafer of\r\nthe Vatican,' it was too much for Doyle.... So he wrote to resign his\r\nconnection with _Punch_, stating his reasons plainly and simply.\"\r\n\r\nBut when Doyle resigned, for reasons which earned him the respect of all\r\nwho heard of them, it was not realised how strong was the undercurrent\r\nof feeling within the _Punch_ office. It is true that at the bottom of\r\nwhat I may call the \"_Punch_ Aggression\" were Jerrold and the\r\nProprietors; and that the onslaught of the one, with the encouragement\r\nof the others, so profoundly wounded Doyle as to force him into\r\nsacrificing lucrative employment, and condemning him in the result to a\r\nlife of toil. But for once in his career Doyle was guilty of behaviour\r\nwhich, if not inexcusable in the circumstances, was certainly\r\nindefensible. He left the paper in the lurch. His letter of resignation\r\nwas sent in on November 27th, he having allowed the Editor to think that\r\nthe blocks for the Almanac, already overdue, had all been completed; and\r\nwhen it was discovered that they had not been done, and that nothing\r\nwas forthcoming, consternation reigned in the office. No doubt the\r\nrevenge was sweet, but it was ill-judged; for while no Catholic member\r\nof the Staff has ever raised his voice in its justification, Doyle's\r\nconduct served but to increase the bitterness of the anti-Catholic\r\nfeeling in _Punch's_ Cabinet, and perhaps to produce attacks more\r\nintemperate than any that had gone before. And, moreover, it rendered\r\nmore difficult the position of others of the same faith who became\r\nmembers of the Staff.\r\n\r\nSo Doyle quitted the paper at the close of 1850, yet his hand was seen\r\nin its pages in 1857, 1862 (four cuts), and 1864. This was a question of\r\n\"old stock\"--a matter which often crops up in _Punch_: it is not a\r\nunique circumstance to see a sketch appear many years after it was\r\ndrawn, and even when the hand that has drawn it has turned to dust. In\r\n1883 there appeared a cut by Mr. Sambourne which was made fifteen years\r\nbefore; and in 1894 there was published a sketch by R. B. Wallace (of\r\nthe late Lord Beaconsfield) a year after the artist died and fourteen\r\nyears after he had ceased to draw for the paper.\r\n\r\nBut when Doyle left _Punch_ he would draw for none of its rivals. With\r\nthe exception of the single lapse already alluded to, his conduct was\r\nalways high-minded and generous; and his virtue and nobility of\r\ncharacter have been testified to by all his friends. He declined the\r\noffer of a large sum to draw for a well-known periodical as he\r\ndisapproved of the principles of its conductors; and on similar grounds\r\nhe refused to illustrate a new edition of Swift. Mr. Holman Hunt has\r\nrecorded his testimony as to his sterling worth. \"Dicky Doyle,\" he tells\r\nme, \"I knew affectionately. John Leech and Doyle were never very\r\ncordial, Doyle's staunch Romanism separating them. While so rigid and\r\nconsistent a religionist, he was one of the most charitable of men, and\r\nwould never be a party to any scandal, however much it had been\r\nprovoked. I am afraid that no portrait was ever painted of him,\r\ncertainly none showing his delightfully amusing laugh, which always\r\nseemed to be indulged apologetically--with the face bent into the cravat\r\nand the double chin pressed forward.\"\r\n\r\nDoyle's great misfortune as an artist was that his father, cultivating\r\nthe son's fancy at the expense of his training, not only would allow him\r\nno regular teaching, but would not permit him to draw from the\r\nmodel--nothing but \"observance of Nature\" and memory-drawing. The result\r\nwas that Doyle remained an amateur to the end--an extremely skilful one,\r\nwhose shortcomings were concealed in his charming illustrations and\r\nimaginative designs, but were startlingly revealed in his larger work\r\nand in his figure-drawing. As a draughtsman he was usually feeble,\r\nthough graceful; his effects, technically speaking, were constantly\r\nfalse, and his drawing often as poor as Thackeray's. He was saved by his\r\ncharm and sweetness, his inexhaustible fun and humour,[51] his\r\ndelightful though superficial realisation of character, and his keen\r\nsense of the grotesque. When he died in December, 1883, _Punch_ devoted\r\nto his memory a poem in which his artistic virtues are generously\r\nappreciated, but not a word is said as to the parting of their ways.\r\nFrom this tribute, this \"reconciliation after death,\" I transcribe one\r\nstanza:--\r\n\r\n  \"Turning o'er his own past pages,\r\n    _Punch_, with tearful smile, can trace\r\n  That fine talent's various stages,\r\n    Caustic satire, gentle grace,\r\n  Feats and freaks of Cockney funny--\r\n    BROWN, and JONES, and ROBINSON;\r\n  And, huge hive of Humour's honey,\r\n    Quaint quintessence of rich fun,\r\n  Coming fresh as June-breeze briary\r\n    With old memories of our youth,\r\n  Thrice immortal _Pips's Diary_!\r\n    Masterpiece of Mirth and Truth!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1844 the versatile artist-dramatist, Watts Phillips, first declared\r\nhimself in _Punch_ with a few examples of his art, which George\r\nCruikshank had fostered. They lasted up to 1846, but amounted to very\r\nlittle. He gave more attention to \"Puck,\" of which Chatto was the\r\neditor; and when, a few years afterwards, he joined \"Diogenes\" as its\r\ncartoonist, he gave full rein to his undoubted talent.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Richard Doyle's brother Henry--better known as a\r\ndistinguished member of the Royal Hibernian Academy, and best of all as\r\nthe grave and extremely able Director of the National Gallery of\r\nIreland--made a number of small cuts for _Punch_, which were published\r\nin 1844 and the following years; but as I was informed, at the time of\r\nhis death, by his elder brother James, now also dead (the chronicler,\r\nand the compiler of the \"Official Baronage of England\"): \"The _Punch_\r\nepisode was the merest child's play to him. His line, chosen years\r\nbefore, was sacred or poetic art; and his illustrations to Telemachus,\r\ndone before this time, remarkable for invention and colour, were greatly\r\nadmired by Prince Albert. That he drew for _Punch_ at one time is, of\r\ncourse, true; but the mention of it gives a false impression of his\r\ntaste and principal work at that period.\" Yet the spirit of humour was\r\nstrong within him, for he was one of the \"Great Gunners\" in 1845; and\r\nfrom 1867 to 1869, when he was appointed to Dublin, he was cartoonist\r\nfor \"Fun,\" signing with a Hen, or \"Fusbos.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Onwhyn, best known, nowadays, perhaps, by his \"extra\r\nillustrations\" to \"Pickwick\" and \"Nicholas Nickleby,\" and by his plates\r\nto \"Valentine Vox\" and Cockton's other novels, began to contribute a few\r\nblocks to _Punch_--a fact which has hitherto been denied. His first\r\ndrawing, published on p. 130, Vol. XIII. (1847), illustrates an article\r\nby Gilbert à Beckett, entitled, \"The Friends Reconciled.\" The next was a\r\n\"Social,\" on p. 230 of the same volume, representing a hatter's wiles\r\nand their victim. But Onwhyn was better used to the etching-needle than\r\nthe pencil, and his drawing on wood was hard and unsympathetic, and his\r\nfigures were usually rather strained than funny. About this time he was\r\nretiring from his position as a popular illustrator of books. Throne\r\nCrick's \"Sketches from the Diary of a Commercial Traveller,\" embellished\r\nby Onwhyn, had just appeared; and the artist was beginning to bring out\r\nhis series of albums of plates, big and small, on all sorts of humorous\r\nsubjects. The time was, therefore, appropriate at which to embark on\r\nindependent illustration in _Punch_. But in the following year he\r\ncontributed not more than a sketch or two; and thenceforward, until he\r\nfinally laid down his pencil in 1870, he confined his artistic efforts\r\nto his own happy ideas with but few exceptions--such as \"Welcome, a\r\nCharade; by W. Shakesides\" (1850). Onwhyn died so late as 1886.\r\n\r\nFor four years, if we except two or three unimportant cuts contributed\r\nby E. J. Burton in 1847-8-9, no new name appears upon the draughtsman's\r\nroll. Then John Macgregor--the celebrated \"Rob Roy\"--who had begun to\r\ncontribute paragraphs and short articles in 1847, commenced adding\r\nsketches, such as his \"Silence in the Gallery,\" in January, 1848.\r\n\"Prince Albert's Hat\" was also his, and others besides; and it is worth\r\nremarking that the proceeds of these sketches and articles were given to\r\nthe police-courts, wherewith the magistrates might assist poor cases.\r\n\r\nThe year 1850 became of the first importance in the history of _Punch_.\r\nNot that William McConnell and his gentle art would make the year\r\nremarkable, for his early defection from _Punch_, and his premature\r\ndeath from consumption, cut short a career which promised considerably\r\nmore than it achieved. Mr. Sala tells me that McConnell was a handsome\r\nlittle fellow, bright, alert, and full of originality. He was always\r\nexceptionally well-dressed--and with good reason, for his father, on\r\ncoming over from Ireland and settling in Tottenham Court Road, resumed\r\nhis trade of tailor. The youth sent in some sketches, which were highly\r\nthought of by Mark Lemon. He was turned over to Mr. Swain for some\r\ninstruction in drawing on the wood, and subsequently took up his\r\nresidence in the engraver's house for a time; but, not living long\r\nenough to prove his individuality, he remained to the end an imitator of\r\nLeech. Perhaps that was the reason that he drew so small a salary from\r\n_Punch_; at any rate, he always resented what he considered to be the\r\ncontumelious and shabby treatment meted out to him by Mark Lemon. But\r\nfor such money as he did receive, it must be admitted that he gave full\r\nvalue in the fierceness of his cartoons on Louis Napoleon. He did much\r\nbook illustration, besides drawing for the Press, serious and comic--his\r\n_Punch_ work including a couple of cartoons in 1852, among a great\r\nnumber of \"socials.\" His last appearance was in July of that year. He\r\nwas a good and improving draughtsman, especially of horses; and he\r\nrevelled in beggars, \"swells,\" and backgrounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. McCONNELL.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph by Southwell Brothers, Baker Street._)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great acquisition of the year was John Tenniel. The paper had been\r\nleft by Doyle, as I have explained, without its Almanac blocks, and it\r\nfound itself, moreover, without a second cartoonist, and, what was quite\r\nas important at the moment, without an artist of distinctly decorative\r\nability, who would provide the fanciful initial-letters, headings, and\r\ntitle-pages which have always been a feature in _Punch_. The\r\ncircumstances of his joining the paper Sir John once recounted to me in\r\nconversation, with that sort of apologetic humour and true modesty that\r\nare characteristic of him:--\r\n\r\n\"I never learned drawing, except in so far as attending a school and\r\nbeing allowed to teach myself. I attended the Royal Academy Schools\r\nafter becoming a probationer, but soon left in utter disgust of there\r\nbeing no teaching. I had a great idea of High Art; in fact, in 1845 I\r\nsent in a sixteen-foot-high cartoon for Westminster Palace. In the Upper\r\nWaiting Hall, or 'Hall of Poets,' of the House of Lords, I made a\r\nfresco, but my subject was changed after my work had been decided on and\r\nworked out. At Christmas, 1850, I was invited by Mark Lemon to fill the\r\nplace suddenly left by Doyle, who with very good reasons for\r\nhimself--that of objection to the \"Papal Aggression\" campaign suddenly\r\nsevered his connection with _Punch_. Doyle had left them in great\r\nstraits--the Pocket-book and Almanac to come out--and I was applied to\r\nby Lemon, on the initiation of Jerrold, to fill the breach. This was\r\non the strength of my illustrations to Æsop's Fables, which had recently\r\nbeen published by Murray. I did the title and half-title to the\r\nnineteenth volume, as well as the first page-border to the Almanac,\r\ntogether with a few initials and odds and ends for the end of that\r\nvolume, and the first illustration to the next; but only the half-title,\r\ntitle, and tail-piece were signed. My first cartoon was that facing page\r\n44 in the twentieth volume; and, only signing occasionally for the first\r\nmonth or two, I went on from time to time doing cartoons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR JOHN TENNIEL, R.I.\r\n\r\n(_From a Pen-Drawing by Himself._)]\r\n\r\n\"As for political opinions, I have none; at least, if I have my own\r\nlittle politics, I keep them to myself, and profess only those of my\r\npaper. If I have infused any dignity into cartoon-designing, that comes\r\nfrom no particular effort on my part, but solely from the high feeling I\r\nhave for art. In any case, if I am a 'cartoonist'--the accepted term--I\r\nam not a caricaturist in any sense of the word. My drawings are\r\nsometimes grotesque, but that is from a sense of fun and humour. Some\r\npeople declare that I am no humorist, that I have no sense of fun at\r\nall; they deny me everything but severity, 'classicality,' and dignity.\r\nNow, _I_ believe that I have a very keen sense of humour, and that my\r\ndrawings are sometimes really funny!\r\n\r\n\"I have now been working regularly at the weekly cartoons for _Punch_\r\nfor close on thirty years (from 1862),[52] missing only two or three\r\ntimes from illness. In all that time I have hardly left London for more\r\nthan a week; yet I enjoy wonderful health, doubtless to be attributed to\r\nregular riding. I carry out my work thus: I never use models or Nature\r\nfor the figure, drapery, or anything else. But I have a wonderful memory\r\nof _observation_--not for dates, but anything I see I remember. Well, I\r\nget my subject on Wednesday night; I think it out carefully on Thursday,\r\nand make my rough sketch; on Friday morning I begin, and stick to it all\r\nday, with my nose well down on the block. By means of tracing-paper--on\r\nwhich I make all alterations of composition and action I may consider\r\nnecessary--I transfer my design to the wood, and draw on that. The\r\nfirst sketch I may, and often do, complete later on as a commission.\r\nIndeed, at the present time I have a huge undertaking on hand, in which\r\nI take great delight--the finishing of scores of my sketches, of which I\r\nhave many hundreds. They are for a friend--an enthusiastic admirer, if I\r\nmay be permitted to say so. Well, the block being finished, it is handed\r\nover to Swain's boy at about 6.30 to 7 o'clock, who has been waiting for\r\nit for an hour or so, and at 7.30 it is put in hand for engraving. That\r\nis completed on the following night, and on Monday night I receive by\r\npost the copy of next Wednesday's paper. Although case-hardened in a\r\nsense, I have never the courage to open the packet. I always leave it to\r\nmy sister, who opens it and hands it across to me, when I just take a\r\nglance at it, and receive my weekly pang. My work would be difficult to\r\nphotograph on to the wood, as it is all done in pencil; the only\r\npen-and-ink work I have done, so far, being for the Almanac and\r\nPocket-book.[53]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUGH PENCIL SKETCH FOR \"ARTHUR AND GUINEVERE,\" FOR\r\n\"PUNCH'S POCKET-BOOK.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WILL IT BURST?\"\r\n\r\n_Captain of Gun:_ \"Ram 'em all down, my lads! She'll stand it safe\r\nenough!!!\"\r\n\r\n(_From Sir John Tenniel's Rough Sketch for the Cartoon in \"Punch,\" 14th\r\nFeb., 1870--p. 67, Vol. LXXVIII._)]\r\n\r\n\"As I never have a model, I never draw from life, always when I want a\r\nportrait, a uniform, and so on, from a photograph, though not in quite\r\nthe same spirit as Sambourne does. I get a photograph only of the man\r\nwhom I want to draw, and seek to get his character. Then, if the\r\nphotograph is in profile, I have to 'judge' the full face, and _vice\r\nversá_; but if I only succeed in getting the character, I seldom go far\r\nwrong--a due appreciation is an almost infallible guide. I had the\r\nopportunity of studying Mr. Gladstone's face carefully when he did me\r\nthe honour of inviting me to dinner at Downing Street, and I have met\r\nhim since; but I fancy, after my 'Mrs. Gummidge' cartoon and 'Janus,' I\r\ndon't deserve to be honoured again! His face has much more character and\r\nis much stronger than Mr. Bright's. Mr. Bright had fine eyes and a\r\ngrand, powerful mouth, as well as an earnest expression; but a weak\r\nnose--artistically speaking, no nose at all--still, a very intellectual\r\nface indeed.\"\r\n\r\nThus it was not only Nature, but the Pope, who marked out Tenniel for\r\nthe position of _Punch's_ Cartoonist--the greatest \"Cartoonist\" the\r\nworld has produced. Had the Pope not \"aggressed\" by appointing\r\narchbishops and bishops to English Sees, and so raised the scare of\r\nwhich Lord John Russell and Mr. Punch really seem to have been the\r\nleaders, Doyle would not have resigned, and no opening would have been\r\nmade for Tenniel. Sir John, indeed, was by no means enamoured of the\r\nprospect of being a _Punch_ artist when Mark Lemon made his overtures to\r\nhim. He was rather indignant than otherwise, as his line was high art\r\nand his severe drawing above \"fooling.\" \"Do they suppose,\" he asked a\r\nfriend, \"that there is anything funny about _me_?\" He meant, of course,\r\nin his art, for privately he was well recognised as a humorist; and\r\nlittle did he know, in the moment of hesitation before he accepted the\r\noffer, that he was struggling against a kindly destiny.\r\n\r\nJohn Tenniel was only sixteen years old when his first oil picture was\r\nexhibited at the Suffolk Street Galleries, and he soon became\r\nrecognised, not only as a painter, but as a book and magazine\r\nillustrator of unusual skill. But he and Keene had already proclaimed\r\nthemselves the humorists they were by the production of the \"Book of\r\nBeauty,\" to which much public attention was drawn when the sketches\r\ncontained in it were exhibited and sold. They had been fellow-students\r\nat the life class, and in the year 1844 were both intimate visitors at\r\nthe house of their friends, Mr. and Mrs. Barrett. After dinner, when the\r\nlamp was brought in, the two young artists would amuse themselves,\r\ntogether with their host, by making drawings in coloured chalks. Mr.\r\nBarrett, it may be said, was a thin man, signing himself \"5-12ths,\" in\r\nrecognition of the nobler proportions of Mrs. Barrett, unquestionably\r\nhis \"better half.\" Keene chose the \"Signs of the Zodiac,\" to begin with,\r\nas the subject of his admirable burlesques, Tenniel having already\r\nselected quotations from Shakespeare, history, poetry, and so forth, the\r\nhumour which he infused into them being equal to anything he afterwards\r\nproduced in _Punch_. But it may interest the present owners of these\r\nhighly-prized productions to know that those who produced them thought\r\nvery little of them as art, while Sir John expressed the greatest\r\nsurprise that in their rubbed condition they should attract any notice\r\nwhatever. As early proofs, however, of the comic faculty of two of\r\n_Punch's_ giants, they were interesting and valuable designs; while, so\r\nfar as Sir John's work was concerned, they were the forerunners of the\r\nextremely humorous illustrations of Shakespearian quotations with which\r\nhe advanced his reputation and his position on the paper.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the severe young classicist determined to accept the\r\nposition offered him in _Punch's_ band, than Mr. Swain was requested to\r\nwait upon him in Newman Street, and instruct him in the art of drawing\r\nupon wood. But he found that Tenniel, the illustrator of the Rev. Thomas\r\nJames's edition of Æsop's Fables, published by John Murray in 1848, was\r\nalready a brilliant expert. The accomplished young draughtsman soon took\r\nkeen delight in the smooth face of a block, and at once began--and\r\never continued--to demand a degree of smoothness that was the\r\ndespair of Swain to procure. Tenniel, indeed, always drew with a\r\nspecially-manufactured six-H pencil--which appears more impressive with\r\nits proper style of \"H H H H H H\"--and so delicate was the drawing that,\r\nfirm and solid as were the lines, it looked as if you could blow it off\r\nthe wood. The result is that Swain has always _interpreted_ Sir John\r\nTenniel's work, not simply facsimile'd it, aiming rather at producing\r\nwhat the artist intended or desired to have, than what he actually\r\nprovided in his exquisite grey drawings. So Swain would thicken his\r\nlines while retaining their character, just as he would reduce Mr.\r\nSambourne's, particularly in the flesh parts, and otherwise bring the\r\nresources of the engraver's art to bear upon the work of the masters of\r\nthe pencil. Doubtless the artists might deplore the \"spoiling\" of their\r\nlines; but pencil greys are not to be reproduced in printer's ink--they\r\nmust be \"rendered.\" And though, as artists, draughtsmen may groan under\r\nthe transitional process, they realise that in submitting their work to\r\nthe wood-cutter's craft, they must take its drawbacks along with its\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUGH SKETCH FOR \"THOR\" FOR \"PUNCH'S POCKET-BOOK.\"]\r\n\r\nThe first drawing by Tenniel in the bound volume is, as he says, the\r\nfrontispiece to the second half-yearly volume for 1850, but his actual\r\nfirst contribution the initial on p. 224 of that volume. Perhaps the\r\nmost notable thing about it is the extraordinary resemblance between\r\nthe artist's work at the beginning and at the end of his career. Of\r\ncourse, it is much \"tighter;\" it is much younger. But the hand and\r\nmethod are strangely unchanged. It is beautiful in its exquisite\r\nprecision and its refinement, and altogether superior in its character\r\nto what its creator, in a spirit of severe self-criticism, chooses to\r\nbelieve. \"My first cartoon,\" he wrote to me, \"was 'Lord Jack the\r\nGiant-Killer'--and awfully bad it is; in fact, all my work, at that\r\nparticular time, NOW seems to me about as bad as bad could be, and fills\r\nme with wonder and amazement!!\" But this cartoon, continuing the Papal\r\ncampaign so hateful to Doyle, by showing Lord John Russell with his\r\nsword of truth and liberty attacking the crozier-armed Cardinal Wiseman,\r\nwas greatly inferior to the smaller contributions. His improvement,\r\nhowever, was rapid. Tenniel's first \"half-page social\" is on p. 218 of\r\nthe same volume; while in 1852 we have his first superb Lion, and his\r\nfirst obituary cartoon. Gradually he took over the political big cut,\r\nwhich Leech was happy to place in his hands; but during the long years\r\nthat they worked together the two men were admirable foils to one\r\nanother. Leech sketched and Tenniel drew; Leech gave us farce and drama,\r\nand Tenniel, high comedy and tragedy; and the freedom of the one\r\nheightened the severer beauties of the other. And when Leech died, his\r\nfriend continued the labour alone. Except in 1864, 1868, and 1875-6-7-8,\r\nin which last-named year he took his first holiday from _Punch_ work and\r\nwent with Mr. Silver to Venice--(during his illness or absence Charles\r\nKeene contributed thirteen cartoons[54])--and again in 1884 and 1894\r\n(when Mr. Sambourne twice took over the duty), he has never, from that\r\nday to this present time of writing, missed a single week. Nearly two\r\nthousand cartoons, initials innumerable, \"socials,\" double-page cartoons\r\nfor the Almanac and other special numbers, and two hundred and fifty\r\ndesigns for the Pocket-books--such is the record of the great satirist's\r\ncareer; and the only change has been in the direction of freedom of\r\npencil and breadth of artistic view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HUMPTY-DUMPTY!\"\r\n\r\n(_From Sir John Tenniel's First Rough Sketch for the Cartoon in \"Punch\"\r\n20th July, 1875--p. 18, Vol. LXXV._)]\r\n\r\nOf his work little need be said here, for in its main bearings it has\r\nalready been fully considered. But acknowledgment must at least be made\r\nof how, with all his sense of fun and humour, Sir John Tenniel has\r\ndignified the political cartoon into a classic composition, and has\r\nraised the art of politico-humorous draughtsmanship from the relative\r\nposition of the lampoon to that of polished satire--swaying parties and\r\npeoples, too, and challenging comparison with the higher (at times it\r\nmight almost be said the highest) efforts of literature in that\r\ndirection. The beauty and statuesque qualities of his allegorical\r\nfigures, the dignity of his beasts, and the earnestness and directness\r\nof his designs, apart from the exquisite simplicity of his work at its\r\nbest, are things previously unknown in the art of which he is the most\r\naccomplished master, standing alone and far ahead of any of his\r\nimitators. The Teutonic character and the academic quality of his work,\r\nmodified by the influence of Flaxman and the Greeks, are no blemishes;\r\none does not even feel that he draws entirely from memory. Indeed, the\r\nthings are completely satisfying as the work of a true artist, and--a\r\nquality almost as grateful and charming as it was previously rare--of a\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nYet this practice of drawing from memory has its drawbacks; for the\r\nthings remembered are apt to grow old-fashioned. The Flying Dutchman was\r\nrunning when Sir John's locomotive still had the odour of Puffing Bilfy\r\nabout it. His indifference to that \"actuality\" which is the\r\ncharacteristic of Mr. Sambourne has often raised the howl of the\r\nspecialist. When in an excellently drawn cartoon full of point\r\n(November, 1893), entitled \"A Bicycle made for Two,\" he grafted the\r\nfeatures of a modern roadster on to the type of 1860, the cycling world\r\nfluttered in a manner that must have been very encouraging to the\r\nartist. His machine, they said, was the most wonderful one ever placed\r\non the market. Sir H. H. Fowler, it was said, was sitting on a\r\nhalf-inch tube without a saddle, and \"working with his heels on pedals\r\nshaped like a Mexican gaucho's stirrup\"--but his critics had clearly\r\nnever seen a gaucho's stirrup. \"Nor has the lady--riding behind, instead\r\nof in front--better accommodation, being in suspension over a frame that\r\nlacks a backstay, and above a wheel that buckles under her weight; while\r\nthe handles are thrown up instead of down, and their bars so slender\r\nthat they must inevitably break.\" The gear-case is on one side of the\r\nframe and the chain on the other, and the frame itself was a marvel of\r\ningenuity misapplied. Thus did the cyclists moan in many newspapers,\r\ntaking the matter _au grand sérieux_, with quite unusual regard for\r\nmechanical accuracy, and a total disregard for the political allusion\r\nand point. Similarly in January of the same year the \"Forlorn Maiden\" of\r\ntrade was shown lying across the railway lines while an engine is\r\nbearing down upon her. But \"there are five rails in sight, all at equal\r\ndistances apart, though the railway gauge is four feet eight inches and\r\na half, and the locomotive is running on the six-foot way.\" The girl,\r\ntoo, stretches across it, and spans it from waist to ankles, not\r\ncounting a bend at the knees, so that at the lowest estimate she is ten\r\nfeet high. This violated the public conscience even more than the fact\r\nthat the engine rushes along the inside line of the two sets of rails;\r\nand they declared that never before had the maxim _ars longa_ been more\r\ntriumphantly indicated than in the maiden's figure. But what of it all?\r\nIs it not a striking commentary on our English temperament, that while\r\nan inaccuracy of a purely mechanical description raises the protests of\r\nthousands who have no idea beyond the parts of a bicycle or the width of\r\na railway gauge, a score of artistic beauties pass unnoticed and\r\nunchallenged?\r\n\r\nAnd so Tenniel worked his way upwards. The fact that in a fencing bout\r\nhe had partially lost his sight, through the button of his father's foil\r\ndropping off, whereupon he received the point in his eye, was not the\r\nslightest deterrent. He regarded it merely as an annoying, though not a\r\nvery important, incident. Being satisfied that the Almighty had only\r\ngiven us _two_ eyes as a measure of precaution, to provide against such\r\nvexatious little accidents as he had experienced, he went on working as\r\nif nothing had happened. \"It's a curious thing, is it not,\" he said one\r\nday to the writer, \"that two of the principal men on _Punch_, du Maurier\r\nand I, have only two eyes between them?\" Yet it only made him the more\r\ncareful. Free from mannerism, he never allowed carefulness to interfere\r\nwith fun, and his cartoon of Britannia discovering the source of the\r\nNile, and of Lord Beaconsfield as a peri entering the Paradise of\r\nPremiership, are among the memorably funny things of _Punch_. His\r\nelevation to the leading position on the paper has thus been gradual and\r\ncertain; not of his own assumption, however, but the ready tribute of\r\nhis colleagues, who have always regarded him not only as the great\r\nartist, but as the link incarnate of the tradition of _Punch_ of the\r\npresent with the past. So he is the favourite of the band, to whom he is\r\nthe beloved \"Jack[=i]d[=e]s\" of Shirley Brooks's christening. It was\r\nMark Lemon who, at the Dinner, first applied to him the burlesque\r\nline--\"No longer Jack, henceforth Jack[=i]d[=e]s call;\" but it was\r\nBrooks who confirmed the practice of according to him the _sobriquet_\r\nwhich _Punch_ (p. 148, Vol. XLV.) had previously conferred on Lord John\r\nRussell, \"England's Briefest Peer.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a startling proof of his extraordinary, and by him\r\nhalf-unsuspected, popularity, that when Tenniel's knighthood became\r\nknown the honour was received with loud and general applause--with an\r\nenthusiasm quite unusual in its command of popular approval. \"I am\r\nreceiving shoals of letters and telegrams,\" he wrote to me on the day of\r\nthe announcement; \"I suppose you know the reason Y.\" It is said that\r\nLord Salisbury had intended to make the recommendation himself, but that\r\nthe nomination was delayed and forgotten; but when Mr. Gladstone came\r\ninto office the new Premier repaired the neglect of the old, and at the\r\nsame time acknowledged the steady support which _Punch_ had offered to\r\nthe Whig policy. By the general public it was regarded as an\r\nappreciation of the man who was the personification of the good-humoured\r\nand the loftier side of political life--who had brought the _Punch_\r\nspirit round to something a good deal better and higher than he found\r\nit, blending fun with classic grace, and humour with dignity. To the art\r\nworld it was the recognition of that \"Black-and-white\" drawing which has\r\nbeen the glory of England and the Cinderella of the Royal Academy of\r\nArts. It was in this sense that Sir John Tenniel accepted the\r\ndistinction. But it was to \"Jack[=i]d[=e]s\" that the _Punch_ Staff drank\r\nwhen Mr. Agnew proposed his health at the Dinner following the\r\nannouncement of the nomination; it was \"dear old John Tenniel\" that the\r\nArts Club toasted when, with Mr. Val Prinsep, R.A., in the chair and Mr.\r\ndu Maurier in the vice-chair, the new knight was the honoured guest of\r\nhis club, and received its congratulations with the modest dignity and\r\nkindly good taste characteristic of him. And it was \"good Sir John,\" the\r\ncartoonist--who has also been, at extremely rare intervals, a _Punch_\r\nwriter too (see _Punch_, p. 56, Vol. XX.)--who was celebrated by the pen\r\nof Mr. Milliken--\"the Pride of Mr. Punch and the delight of the British\r\nPublic.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[51] It may be stated that Doyle contributed a ewe-lamb of literature to\r\n_Punch_ (May 13th, 1843), entitled \"High Art and the Royal Academy\"\r\n(Vol. XVI., p. 197).\r\n\r\n[52] This conversation took place in April, 1889.\r\n\r\n[53] Since 1892, I may explain, Sir John Tenniel and _Punch_ have moved\r\nwith the times. Sir John now draws his cartoons upon the\r\nChinese-whitened surface of cardboard, and they are photographed on the\r\nblock in the usual way.\r\n\r\n[54] But when, in 1866, Keene contributed three cartoons, Sir John\r\nTenniel's appeared side by side. This was the result of a revived\r\nexperiment to add to the attractions of the paper by giving two\r\ncartoons--an experiment resumed in later years in the case of Mr.\r\nSambourne and Mr. Furniss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n_PUNCH'S_ ARTISTS: 1850-60.\r\n\r\n     Captain Howard--Receipt for Landscape Drawing--Earnings, Real and\r\n     Ideal--George H.

This was Captain Henry R. Howard, the son of a country\r\ngentleman, born at Watford, where he lived in the same house for over\r\nfifty years. He was always sketching from a child; and being persuaded\r\nby his friends to \"do some of those for _Punch_,\" he sent a few samples\r\nto the Editor, but without much hope of success. They brought an\r\nimmediate invitation to call upon Mark Lemon, who told him, after seeing\r\nhis pencil sketches, that he might draw for them, but not on paper, on\r\nwood; and learning that he had had no such experience, referred him for\r\ninstruction to the courtesy of Leech and Tenniel, whose senior he was by\r\nsix years. He was not entirely without artistic education, having\r\nstudied in Hanover under a pupil of Benjamin West's. \"You must draw\r\nskeletons,\" said Herr Ramburg. \"But I only want to draw landscapes,\"\r\npleaded the youth. \"Then you must draw skeletons first,\" replied the\r\nartist; \"it is the only way to draw landscapes.\"\r\n\r\nAfter securing Lemon's favour Captain Howard drew scores of comic\r\nhumanised beasts and birds in the form of initials and decorations. At\r\nlast, after some years, Lemon proposed a change, when Howard quietly\r\nremarked, \"I've been wondering how long you'd go on taking those things;\r\nI should have thought you were sick of them. I am.\" Meanwhile he had\r\nchanged his signature of the Manx legs--he had just been sojourning in\r\nthe island when he adopted them--as Lemon represented it as Leech's\r\nopinion that it was sometimes unnecessarily like his own wriggling\r\nsignature; and he had adopted in substitution the little trident that\r\nfigured in the paper for fifteen years. When Leech died, Captain Howard\r\naspired to be--in part, at least--his successor; but although he was now\r\ndrawing figure-subjects, and had an inexhaustible stock of jokes and\r\nfun, he was told, to his bitter disappointment, that new blood was\r\nwanted; and the great mantle which had fallen was now drawn round the\r\nshoulders of Charles Keene and Mr. du Maurier. Captain Howard then\r\npractically retired. Although in the first year of his contributions he\r\nwas £30 out of pocket by his _Punch_ work, as he bought his own blocks\r\ninstead of claiming them from Swain, he was soon making £100 a year from\r\nthe paper. Just before he retired an officer recently returned from\r\nIndia expressed the desire to draw also for _Punch_ as a profession. \"I\r\nhear,\" said he, \"that Leech makes £1,500 a year out of it.\" \"So that you\r\nwould be satisfied with £1,200?\" asked Captain Howard. His friend\r\nadmitted that even the inferior sum would be acceptable. \"Very well,\"\r\nreplied Howard encouragingly; \"come and dine with me, and I'll show you\r\nby my books that my _Punch_ income last year was just twelve pounds!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Howard's work, though clever and ingenious, was weak. Its\r\nhumour, often fresh enough, was never very pronounced; nor did the\r\ndraughtsman's hand ever become that of a master. In 1853 he had made no\r\nfewer than sixty-six cuts, and about doubled that number each year up to\r\n1867, when, with only two drawings in the volume, he finally vanished\r\nfrom _Punch's_ pages. Three years later there was printed an initial by\r\nhim, representing a comic hammer-fish (p. 265, Vol. LIX.), but this\r\nbelonged to \"old stock;\" and it marks the failure of its author's\r\nlong-sustained effort to obtain a recognised position in the front rank\r\nof the artistic Staff. He died 31st August, 1895.\r\n\r\nA contemporary of his was G. H. Thomas, brother of one of the founders\r\nof the \"Graphic,\" and a popular painter of the day, who received much\r\nemployment from the Queen. Mark Lemon was very anxious to secure the\r\nservices of so admirable a draughtsman; but Thomas, who was trying to\r\nshake himself free from wood-drawing in favour of oil-painting, showed\r\nlittle responsive enthusiasm. He did, however, contribute a couple of\r\ndrawings--one of them a large head-piece to the preface, representing a\r\nfeast given to _Punch_ on his twenty-first volume day. In it he is\r\nsupported by the Queen and Court, and at the round table are the\r\nrepresentatives of the nations. It is not a happy effort, and is clearly\r\ninspired by Doyle--whose fancy the Editor was still seeking to replace;\r\nand, moreover, it is poorly engraved; but it is as full of figures as of\r\nincident. Then came C. H. Bradley, who seldom got beyond initials and\r\ntrifles of large heads on little bodies, being only once or twice\r\npromoted to \"socials\" during the nine years of his connection with the\r\npaper. On occasion he showed real humour, while his artistic merit seems\r\nto have owed most of what excellence it possessed to the study of\r\nTenniel's work. Bradley, whose monogram might easily be mistaken by the\r\nunwary for that of C. H. Bennett, who followed eight years later,\r\nexecuted but five-and-thirty cuts between 1852 and 1860.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES S. KEENE.\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by J. D. Watson. By Courtesy of \"Black and White.\"_)]\r\n\r\n_Punch_ was ten years old when the hand of Charles Keene, but not\r\nCharles Keene himself, was introduced to the Editor, through the\r\ninstrumentality of Mr. Henry Silver. Keene had at first been intended\r\nfor the law, and afterwards had spent a short period in an architect's\r\noffice. But he decided to throw himself into art; and in order to learn\r\nengraving and drawing on the wood, he followed the practice of the day\r\n(such as had been adopted by Leech, William Harvey, Fred Walker, Mr.\r\nBirket Foster, Mr. Walter Crane, and other of _Punch's_ artists), and\r\napprenticed himself to an engraver--Whymper, for choice. Then he studied\r\nalong with his comrade Tenniel and other incipient geniuses at the\r\nClipstone Street Academy, and as early as 1846 produced with his\r\nfriend--who was soon to be his fellow-giant on _Punch_--the \"Book of\r\nBeauty,\" already referred to. He took a studio in the Strand--a\r\nsky-parlour renowned for its dust and inaccessibility--and lived, as all\r\ngood Bohemians should, chiefly on art, song, and smoke: an existence\r\nsweetened by a few warm but eclectic friendships. He worked desperately\r\nhard, and having, through his fellow-shireman Samuel Read, become\r\nconnected with the \"Illustrated London News,\" he made for it many\r\ndrawings of the sort now called \"actuality.\"\r\n\r\nBy that time Mr. Henry Silver had contracted with Keene an\r\nacquaintanceship which was to grow into a warm friendship, and it was\r\nunder the shadow of that intimacy that his earlier contributions were\r\nmade. As Mr. Silver himself explains in his statement written for Mr.\r\nGeorge S. Layard's admirable \"Life and Letters of Charles Keene of\r\n_Punch_\" (p. 47): \"It may seem a little strange that Keene at first\r\nshowed some reluctance to let his name be known where it was finally so\r\nfamous. Still, it is the fact that while his earliest _Punch_ drawings\r\nwere of my devising, he steadily declined to own himself the doer of\r\nthem. I was writing then for _Punch_ as an outsider, but my ambition was\r\nto draw, and for this I had no talent. As for working on the wood, I\r\nsoon 'cut' it in despair, and, like a baffled tyrant, I knew not how to\r\nbring my subjects to the block. Keene very kindly undertook the labour\r\nfor me, and the first design he executed was 'A Sketch of the New Paris\r\nStreet-sweeping Machines'--a couple of cannon, namely--which was\r\npublished in December, 1851, immediately after the bloody _coup\r\nd'état_.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the barest sketch, childish and shaky in execution, which,\r\nhowever, is explained in the legend as being due to the \"Special Artist\"\r\nbeing in the line of fire. Mr. Layard asserts that when Keene made the\r\ndrawing he thought the joke \"a mighty poor one;\" and he might have\r\nadded, as is made clear in the chapter dealing with \"Plagiarism,\" not\r\neven a new one, for _Punch_ himself had used the idea before (p. 166,\r\nVol. XV.), and was then accused of theft by the \"Man in the Moon.\" Mr.\r\nSilver proceeds:--\r\n\r\n\"His next two drawings illustrate an article of mine, and appear on the\r\nsecond page of the next volume. His fourth, a far more finished drawing,\r\nlike these, saw the light in 1852, and may be found in Vol. XXIII., p.\r\n257. It shows a gentleman engaged in fishing in his kitchen, and is\r\nentitled 'The Advantage of an Inundation,' the autumn of that year being\r\nvery wet. Mark Lemon wrote to me commending it, and asking me to try and\r\ndraw a little more for him. I showed Charles the letter, and said that\r\nnow, of course, his name must be divulged, for I clearly was obtaining\r\n_kudos_ under false pretences. However, he deferred the disclosure for a\r\nwhile, and it was not until the spring of 1854 that his 'C. K.' first\r\nappeared (_vide_ initial 'G,' Vol. XXVI., p. 128)--a modest little\r\nmonogram, quite unlike his later and so well-known signature. In the\r\ninterim he marked his drawings with a mask, which was a device of mine\r\nfor hiding his identity.\"\r\n\r\nFor nine years Keene worked steadily on _Punch_, improving artistically\r\nin an amazing manner, and in 1860 he was called to the Table--they\r\nserved long terms of probation then--and ate his first Dinner on\r\nFebruary 20th. It was a notable company that he used to meet, all the\r\nchief \"rising stars\" of _Punch_ being still upon the Staff, save Douglas\r\nJerrold, who had died three years before. There were Mark Lemon,\r\nThackeray (nominally retired), Tom Taylor, Horace Mayhew, Shirley\r\nBrooks, Percival Leigh, John Leech, Henry Silver, and John Tenniel; and\r\ninto this brilliant assemblage, on the evening in question (when,\r\nhowever, Thackeray was absent, and Sir Joseph Paxton was present as a\r\nvisitor), he was received with a cordial welcome. But neither at that\r\ntime nor thenceforward did he take a prominent part in the discussions\r\nover the cartoon, although on one occasion he did astonish the company\r\nwith an excellent though belated suggestion. He had, in fact, no\r\noriginality of a literary or humorous kind. He knew the exact value of a\r\njoke when it was made, and could usually display its point to\r\nincomparable advantage; but joke-creation was not one of his strong\r\npoints, even though he was often forced to it by necessity.\r\nOccasionally, however, he would miss a point entirely, as in the joke\r\nsent him by Mr. Alfred Cooper[55]:--\r\n\r\n     \"VISITOR (_having shot a hare at the usual seventy yards_): 'Long\r\n     shot that, Johnson.'\r\n\r\n     \"KEEPER: 'Yes, sir; Master remarked as it were a wery long shot.'\r\n\r\n     \"VISITOR (_gratified_): 'Ah! Oh, he noticed it, did he?'\r\n\r\n     \"KEEPER: 'Yes, sir; Master always take notice. When gen'lemen makes\r\n     wery long shots, they don't get asked again!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" asks Keene, \"would 'Master' object to this long shot? Burnand ...\r\nis sure to want to know I don't know either! Will you kindly explain, so\r\nthat I can answer him as if I were an expert.\" As if even a\r\nnon-sportsman would fail to see the point!\r\n\r\nBut at the Table, delightful as Keene personally was--he was lovingly\r\naddressed as \"Carlo\"--he was not a leading conversationalist. He\r\nproposed little; yet when his opinion was asked, he gave it, with\r\njudgment and taste, tersely expressed. His work, besides, was rarely\r\ndiscussed at the Table, for he usually had to seek his material outside.\r\nMoreover, he was, as he expressed it, a \"hot Tory,\" and so strongly\r\nantipathetic did he profess himself towards the Liberal tendency of some\r\nof the Staff of that day that he would declare with a wink that he\r\npositively preferred to stay away; and on the occasion of the accession\r\nof Mr. Anstey, wrote this sturdy Conservative \"I hope he's a Tory. We\r\nwant some leaven to the set of sorry Rads that lead poor old _Punch_\r\nastray at present.\" But few independent readers, and fewer still of\r\nKeene's personal friends, will take very seriously his sweeping\r\nassertion and political pronunciamentoes--at least, as regards _Punch_,\r\nfor whom and for his colleagues he retained to the end feelings of the\r\nwarmest affection.\r\n\r\nWhen John Leech died in 1864, it was Keene who received the main\r\nheritage of his great position as the social satirist of the paper, and\r\nwith it the heaviest share of work and artistic responsibility. Not only\r\ndid his work increase in the ordinary numbers, but extra drawings--such\r\nas the etched frontispieces to the Pocket-books--fell also to his lot;\r\nand a good deal against the grain--for he hated any approach to\r\npersonality, even though his target was a public man and his shaft was\r\ntipped with harmless fun--he executed fourteen cartoons, as is explained\r\nelsewhere. In addition to his ordinary \"socials\" and the formal\r\ndecorations of each successive volume, Keene re-illustrated \"Mrs.\r\nCaudle's Curtain Lectures\" with a marvellous series of drawings, and Mr.\r\nFrank C. Burnand's \"Tracks for Tourists,\" which made their first\r\nappearance as \"How, When, and Where\" (1864) and were ultimately\r\nrepublished in \"Very Much Abroad.\" Of his outside work for \"Once a\r\nWeek,\" published by Messrs. Bradbury and Evans, and other publications,\r\nno mention need here be made.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if the public will ever realise how great an artist Keene\r\nwas. His transcendent merit has, however, for a long time been the\r\nwonder and admiration of his brother-craftsmen and of the critics. The\r\nstream of his genius continued to flow for six-and-thirty years in the\r\nmost amazing manner. His drawings are in the highest form of\r\nImpressionism, reproducing every phase of fleeting expression and\r\nsuddenly-arrested action with a certainty and accuracy which are\r\nabsolutely unsurpassable. His power of composition, of breadth of\r\nhandling, chiaroscuro, and suggestion of colour and form, was perfect\r\nwithin the range of his medium; and in that medium he gave us, not paper\r\nwith pen-lines on it, but a perfect sense of light, form, and\r\nexpression. He was as careful, too, in his \"comic cuts\" as the most\r\nconscientious of painters could be in his canvas; and drawing invariably\r\nfrom the model--even if that model were simply an old shoe--he would\r\noften journey into the country for a background of, say, a turnip-field,\r\nor in search of any other detail or local colour.\r\n\r\nIn one direction alone did he fail, or choose to fail--in the portrayal\r\nof facial beauty, elegance, and respectability. A pretty woman lurked\r\nbut rarely about the point of his pencil, as she does so delightfully\r\nabout those of his principal collaborators on _Punch_; and an elegant\r\nwoman--save by accident--never. You may point to the Brittany peasant in\r\nthe number for September 20th, 1856; to the very Leechy young lady on p.\r\n188, Vol. XXXVI. (May 7th, 1859), who, it must be admitted, really is a\r\n\"lady;\" and to one or two more. But these pretty women serve rather to\r\naccentuate the ugliness of all his other women, when they should have\r\nbeen most beautiful; while elegance is with him a virtue that very\r\nrarely saves. Keene, indeed, misrepresented his countrywomen as much as\r\nM. Forain libels his. Keene's \"swells,\" and even his gentlemen, are\r\nsnobs; his aristocracy and his clerks are cast in the same mould; his\r\ncity young men are like artizans; and his brides are forbidding--models\r\nof virtue, no doubt, but lacking every outward feminine charm. These\r\nshortcomings, of course, are to a certain extent to be accounted for by\r\nhis own nature. Living in the strictest economy and temperateness, he\r\nhated anything like ostentation. He despised \"Society\" and the whole\r\nfabric of fashion, and held the world of Burke and Debrett in\r\ngood-natured abhorrence. Like Leech and Dickens, he had given his heart\r\nto the middle and lower-middle classes, and among them he found his best\r\nmodels and most admirable _motifs_.\r\n\r\nNo _Punch_ artist was ever so dependent upon his friends for \"subjects\"\r\nas he, and none received such continuous and delightful support. From\r\nMessrs. Joseph Crawhall, Andrew Tuer, Walker, Clayton, Birket Foster,\r\nSands, Pritchett, Savile Clark, Ashby-Sterry, Chasemore, and others, he\r\nwas under constant friendly, and fully-acknowledged, obligation. Not but\r\nthat he made constant effort to secure \"jokes\" of his own. He was ever\r\non the look-out, and often very hard-pressed, for them. One day he told\r\nMr. Pritchett that he had determined to join a riding class at Allen's\r\nRiding-school, and seek inspiration there. His friend amiably suggested\r\nthat he (Mr. Pritchett) should attend as observer and reporter, and tell\r\nKeene all the ridiculous things he did on horseback and the amusing\r\nappearances he cut. But the idea did not seem to commend itself to\r\nKeene, who merely replied that he thought he should choose a\r\nhearse-horse to ride, as being at once more stately, decorative, and\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nAmongst Keene's own subjects are to be included the greater number of\r\nthose series of drawings dealing with artist and volunteer life; but it\r\nmust be recognised that to a great extent Keene was frankly the\r\nillustrator of other men's ideas, and often of other men's \"legends.\"\r\nThese legends, or \"cackle,\" were often touched up by Keene; but\r\nsometimes they were entirely original. And though it must be admitted\r\nthat they are not concise as Leech's, they are, as a rule, more\r\nlife-like, more truthfully Impressionistic--just as his drawings are.\r\nThe \"legend,\" by the way, Keene used to term the \"libretto\"--a\r\nreflection, as it were, of his passion for music (a passion he shared\r\nwith Gainsborough and Dyce and Romney, and so many more of our most\r\neminent artists). This love of music he indulged at the meetings of the\r\nMoray Minstrels, in the Crystal Palace Choir during the Handel\r\nFestivals, and in the depths of the country, wherein he would bury\r\nhimself in order to torture the bagpipes, without testing too severely\r\nthe forbearance of his fellow-men.\r\n\r\nWhen he secured a good story--which he loved to impart with an ecstatic\r\nwink to one or other of his closest friends--he would look as carefully\r\nto the \"libretto\" as to the drawing, as in the case of the British\r\nfarmer who, crossing the Channel for the first time--in great discomfort\r\nat the roll of the boat--\"This Capt'n don't understand his business.\r\n_Dang it, why don't he keep in the furrows?_\" or the story--older, by\r\nthe way, than Keene had any knowledge of--of the Scotchman who was asked\r\nby a friend, upon whom he had called, if he would take a glass of\r\nwhiskey. \"No,\" he said, \"it's too airly; besides, I've had a gill\r\na'ready!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES KEENE TORTURING THE BAGPIPES.\r\n\r\n(_From a Pen-Drawing by Himself. By Permission of Henry S. Keene.\r\nEngraved by J. Swain._)]\r\n\r\nAnd when his legends were altered by the Editor he would fret for a\r\nweek. Once when Tom Taylor altered the good Scotch of a \"field preacher\"\r\n(Almanac for 1880) he declared himself \"in a great rage,\" and swore that\r\nhe would \"never forgive\" the delinquent. On other occasions, too, he\r\nfumed at the desecration of his \"librettos;\" and when the word \"last\"\r\nwas accidentally omitted from his joke--\"Heard my [last] new song?\" \"Oh,\r\nLor! I hope so!!\" he mourned over the loss of the point. Yet he might\r\nhave been comforted; for had the word been retained, the further charge\r\nof plagiarism could have been sustained against him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM CHARLES KEENE TO HIS EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nBut his sorest point against _Punch_--to which, after all, he was\r\nsincerely attached--was not the alteration, but the total suppression of\r\nsome of his work. Two such cases are duly recorded by Mr. Layard--both\r\nof them admirable jokes in their way, though perhaps of questionable\r\ntaste. The first deals with a \"Bereaved Husband's\" opposition to the\r\n\"Sympathetic Undertaker's\" remorseless insistence that the chief mourner\r\nshould enter the first carriage with his mother-in-law. \"Ah! well,\" he\r\nsighs, with resignation; \"_but it will completely spoil my day!_\"\r\n\r\nThe second story--to which an excellent drawing was made--tells of a\r\nwidow who looks with sorrowful resignation upon a portrait of her\r\nhusband that hangs above the fireplace, and says to her sympathising\r\nfriend: \"But why should I grieve, dear? I know where he passes his\r\nevenings now!\" The first of these Mark Lemon--ever anxious to avoid\r\ngiving offence--declined on the ground that it was too hard upon\r\nmothers-in-law; and the second because, in Keene's own words, \"Our\r\nPhilistine Editor ... said it would 'jar upon feelings'!\" He surely\r\ncould not have borne completer testimony to the care, the ultra-respect\r\nfor others' sentiments, which has usually distinguished _Punch_, to the\r\ndisgust of critics of less refinement and consideration.\r\n\r\nOn another point, too, he was not at one with _Punch_, and that was\r\n\"Toby.\" The form and face of Mr. Punch, as rendered by him, was hardly a\r\nclassic rendering; but this was forgiven him. But Keene's Toby was\r\nneither the cur represented by some, nor the Irish terrier affected by\r\nothers, but a _dachshund_! And he persisted in so drawing him to the\r\nend, not because he thought it right, but because \"it _might_ have\r\nbeen!\" and because the original of the beast was his own much-loved pet\r\n\"Frau,\" which he survived not many days. (See next page.)\r\n\r\nTo this drawing particular interest attaches, for it is the very last\r\nthat ever came from his hand--a loving tribute to an old friend that had\r\npassed away. Concerning it, Mr. Henry S. Keene writes to me: \"The\r\nhistory of the dog is shortly this. She was a favourite old dog of my\r\nbrother's, and has figured a good many times in his drawings as the dog\r\nof the 'typical' _Punch_, and was of the breed of the 'dachshund.' She\r\nwas very old and full of infirmities, and my brother consented, with\r\nsome reluctance, to put the poor thing out of its misery. When it was\r\ndead, he had it put on a chair in his room, and made the sketch. This\r\nwas about three months before he died, and was the last thing he drew.\r\nIt required an effort on his part, as he had entirely left off doing any\r\nwork since the beginning of last year [1890].\"\r\n\r\nMore than any other man on _Punch_, Keene suffered at the hands of the\r\nengraver. But it was wholly his own fault. He took no heed whatever of\r\nthe engraver, and set before him problems to which there was no\r\nsolution. Thus, he loved to make his drawings on old rough paper, which\r\nby its grain gave a wonderfully charming but irreproducible quality to\r\nhis ragged lines, and which by stains of age would impart effects wholly\r\nforeign to the art of the wood-cutter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"FRAU,\" ALIAS \"TOBY,\" LYING IN STATE.\r\n\r\n(_Keene's Last Drawing._)]\r\n\r\nMoreover, he would manufacture his own inks in varying degrees of\r\ngreyness, and even of different colours, and then set them before the\r\ncutter (not the _engraver_, mind) to translate into black-and-white. Yet\r\nthere are some who blame the craftsman for not reproducing what it was\r\nan absolute impossibility to reproduce by printer's ink and graver! But\r\nKeene was engrossed in his art; and I have seen a drawing, at Mr. Birket\r\nFoster's house at Witley, which was the _seventh_ attempt he made before\r\nhe was satisfied. This was the drawing entitled \"Ahem!\" representing a\r\nman kissing a girl, while someone, with the familiar inconsiderateness\r\nof humanity, is approaching. The background for this drawing is Mr.\r\nFoster's house.\r\n\r\nBut although Keene was not a man of ideas, his merits as a creator--as a\r\nrealiser of types--were supreme. Many of his _dramatis personæ_ no doubt\r\nbecame old-fashioned in a sense; but who can deny the truth to life of\r\nthe Kirk Elder, the slavey, the policeman, the fussy City man, the\r\ndiner-out, the waiter (did he not invent \"Robert\"?), the cabman, the\r\nhen-pecked husband, the drunkard, the gillie, the Irish peasant, the\r\nschoolboy, and the Mrs. Brown of Arthur Sketchley's prosaic muse? The\r\nwealth of his limited fancy, and his power of resolving it into\r\nwell-ordered design, and presenting it with strange economy of means,\r\ninvested these puppets of his with a vividness which is often startling.\r\nWith greater force and subtlety, if with less refinement and grace, than\r\nLeech--though not, like him, the genial sketcher of the genial side of\r\nthings--he has recorded, in the five or six thousand designs that make\r\nup the sum of his contribution, the character of \"the classes\" of our\r\nday, and that with such intensity of truth that we derive our delight in\r\nhis work even more from the faithfulness of its representation than from\r\nthe fun of the joke and the comic rendering of the subject. One writer\r\nhas been found who sees in his pictures nothing but degradation, and who\r\ncondemns the one which shows a tippler who has returned late and thrown\r\nhimself upon the bed beside his wife fully clad and with his umbrella\r\nopen, as \"obscene, and it is matched by many another equally odious!\"\r\nBut everybody else will endorse Sir Frederic Leighton's enthusiastic\r\ntestimony that \"among the documents for the study in future days of\r\nmiddle-class and of humble English life, none will be more weighty than\r\nthe vivid sketches of this great humorist.\"[56] In praising Keene's\r\n\"feeling of out-of-doorness,\" in the \"Magazine of Art,\" Mr. William\r\nBlack criticised truly when he declared, \"Ever and again we come upon a\r\nbit of a turnip-field, a hedge-row, even the corner of a London street,\r\nthe vividness of which is a sudden delight to the eyes.\" This estimate\r\nwas well thrown into verse a few months later, when _Punch_ in its\r\nbereavement sang the praises of its greatest artist:--\r\n\r\n  \"... Nor human humours only; who so tender\r\n    Of touch when sunny Nature out-of-door\r\n  Wooed his deft pencil? Who like him could render\r\n    Meadow or hedge-row, turnip-field or moor?\r\n\r\n  Snowy perspective, long suburban winding\r\n    Of bowery roadway, villa-edged and trim,\r\n  Iron-railed city street, where gas-lamps blinding\r\n    Glare through the foggy distance, dense and dim?\"\r\n\r\nKeene's simple, kind, and somewhat lonely life are too well known to\r\ncall for recapitulation here--his tenderness and chivalry towards women,\r\nhis unconventionality, his love of ancient pipes and virulent\r\n\"dottle\"-smoking, his quaint story-telling and singular modesty, his\r\nsensitiveness (he never would ask his nephew, Mr. Corbould, to sit as\r\nmodel to him again after a bantering inquiry of how much he was going to\r\npay), his Conservatism, his humour, his gentle hobbies, and, lastly, his\r\nstern economy. Indeed, by his thrift, when he died, he was found to have\r\naccumulated over £30,000, chiefly out of his _Punch_ work, in spite of\r\nthe fact that he would never receive a salary: all this is accessible\r\nelsewhere. For some time before he died he ceased to draw for the paper,\r\nso broken was he; and it is worth noting that the last sketch that\r\nappeared from his hand was \"'Arry on the Boulevards,\" in the Paris\r\nNumber of _Punch_ (1889), although he was not able to join the rest of\r\nthe Staff in their trip to the Universal Exhibition.\r\n\r\nHe died on the 10th of January, 1891, and was buried in Hammersmith\r\nCemetery, in the presence of most of his colleagues, who mourned their\r\nfriend--\r\n\r\n  \"Frank, loyal, unobtrusive, simple-hearted,\r\n    Loving his book, his pipe, his song, his friend;\r\n  Peaceful he lived and peacefully departed,\r\n    A gentle life-course with a gracious end.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Martin--a son of the distinguished painter of Biblical\r\ncatastrophes, of boundless halls, and illimitable space, John\r\nMartin--made three drawings for _Punch_. \"The Bonnet-maker's Dream\" was\r\nan effort to enlist sympathy for one class of women-workers; but his\r\nonly fair illustrated joke was that in which a page-boy, pointing to the\r\nold torch-extinguishers in one of the London squares, informs his\r\nwondering companion that they are \"what the swells in ancient days put\r\ntheir weeds out with.\" But as an artist he was lazy, preferring to make\r\noccasional nice little water-colour drawings than to work hard and\r\ncontinuously at black-and-white. He succeeded in making his way into\r\nsociety as a man-'bout-town, which he preferred to either; so that his\r\nconnection with _Punch_ began and ended with the year 1853.\r\n\r\nAn amateur signing \"C\" made an anonymous appearance in the same year;\r\nand Mr. Harry Hall, who was horse-painter first at Tattersall's, and\r\nafterwards at Newmarket, where he made Mark Lemon's acquaintance while\r\npainting a Derby Winner, contributed a single sketch. It is not\r\nremarkable, nor superior to his subsequent work as horse-draughtsman to\r\nthe \"Field\"; but it proves, at least, that Mr. Sydney P. Hall's father\r\ncould draw with ease.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1853 that the Reverend Edward Bradley[57] first contributed a\r\ndrawing to _Punch_ under his well-known pseudonym, but earlier than that\r\nhe found admittance in its pages, with both picture and prose, under the\r\nsignature, not of \"Cuthbert Bede,\" but simply \"E. B.\" The _nom de plume_\r\nunder which he is best known he adapted from the names of the two patron\r\nsaints of Durham, to which city he was much attached, and within whose\r\nboundaries he spent his 'Varsity career.\r\n\r\n\"Photography being a novelty in 1853,\" says he in his MS. reminiscences,\r\nto the transcript of which I have had access through the courtesy of his\r\nson, Mr. Cuthbert Bradley, \"Mark Lemon readily accepted my proposal to\r\nintroduce it into _Punch_,\" and accordingly, the first four caricature\r\nillustrations of photography that appeared were in _Punch_, between May\r\nand August, 1853. One of these represented \"The Portrait of an Eminent\r\nPhotographer who has just succeeded in focussing a view to his Complete\r\nSatisfaction.\" He was depicted with his head under the hood, while a\r\nbull was charging him in the rear--a sketch that was pleasantly referred\r\nto by Charles Kingsley in his novel, \"Two Years Ago.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. EDWARD BRADLEY (\"CUTHBERT BEDE\").\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph by A. J. Hancock._)]\r\n\r\nTo the encouragement of Mark Lemon, Cuthbert Bede owed a good deal, in\r\nrespect to both pen and pencil, and in the warmth of his geniality the\r\nsketches for \"Verdant Green\" were made, and, says the author, more than\r\nforty of them were engraved for _Punch's_ pages, to appear a page each\r\nweek.[58] But circumstances caused Mark Lemon, with Cuthbert Bede's\r\nconsent, to transfer them to a special Supplement at that time being\r\nprepared by _Punch's_ Editor for the \"Illustrated London News\"--a\r\njournal which then enjoyed the co-operation of all the best pens and\r\npencils more closely identified with the Sage of Fleet Street.\r\n\r\nThen in 1850 the MS. of \"Verdant Green\" went the round of the publishers\r\nfor issue in book-form, and not till after a year's tour was it\r\naccepted, and reluctantly enough issued, the publisher vowing that it\r\nwould not pay its expenses. But within four-and-twenty hours he found\r\nout his mistake, and the announcement was made thirty years afterwards,\r\nthat the sale of the book had amounted to upwards of 170,000\r\ncopies--while the author, from first to last, received the splendid sum\r\nof £350 for a work which must be reckoned among the great popular\r\nsuccesses of the century.\r\n\r\nWhen Douglas Jerrold was at Oxford, in November, 1854, Cuthbert Bede was\r\npresented to the sharp-tongued wit, the introducer adding, by way of\r\nexplanation, \"Mr. Verdant Green.\" \"At that time,\" says Bede, \"I was\r\nclosely shaven, and had a very pale face. Douglas Jerrold looked sharply\r\nup at me, with a glitter in his blue eyes, and at once said, 'Mr.\r\nVerdant Green? I should have thought it was Mr. Blanco White!'\"--though,\r\nof course, there was no more real resemblance between Blanco White's\r\nface and that of the Rev. Bradley's, than there was between \"Mr. Verdant\r\nGreen\" and \"Doblado's Letters from Spain.\" \"Among several things that\r\nwere very agreeable to me in connection with the publication of 'Verdant\r\nGreen,'\" he continues, \"was a circumstance that was related to me by an\r\neminent Oxford don, who is now a bishop. He had entered the room of Dr.\r\nPusey, at Christ Church, and saw, as usual, the library table covered\r\nwith books of divinity and learned tomes; but on the top of these was\r\nperched, in pert, cock-sparrow fashion, that shilling railway book that\r\nhad recently been published, with the spectacled face of the Oxford\r\nFreshman on the cover. My friend told me that Dr. Pusey held up the book\r\nto him and said, that he had not only read it through, but that he kept\r\nit on his table so that he might read bits of it in the pauses of his\r\nseverer study.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Cuthbert Bede's proudest memories was the introduction of the\r\ndouble acrostic. He did not claim to have invented it, for he knew of\r\nthe monkish acrostics; but for six months he had amused his friends with\r\nhis revival before he showed them to Mark Lemon. The latter, with a\r\nquick eye for novelty, asked Bradley to write a paper on them for the\r\n\"Illustrated London News,\" which was then being edited by Dr. Charles\r\nMackay, and the humorist was only too happy to comply with the request.\r\nThe first of these \"double acrostic charades\"--the first ever\r\nprinted--appeared in the paper on August 30, 1856, and at intervals for\r\nsome months afterwards; indeed, there was a regular column devoted to\r\nthem, edited by Cuthbert Bede, that drew letters from all parts of the\r\nworld, literally in thousands, which were forwarded to him in packets by\r\nrail. He had to explain their construction, and give examples for\r\npractice in the art.\r\n\r\nThe first was \"Charles Dickens--Pickwick Papers\"; then followed\r\n\"London--Thames,\" \"Waterloo--Napoleon,\" \"Scutari Hospital--Miss\r\nNightingale,\" and then \"Lemon--Punch.\" Here is how the last-named was\r\ntreated:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LETTERS (5).\r\n\r\n  I brighten even the brightest scene             (L am P)\r\n  I very nearly an ostrich had been               (E m U)\r\n  I with a hood once pass'd all my days           (M aria N)\r\n  I am a fop in a play of all plays               (O sri C)\r\n  To its greatness the city of Bath I did raise   (N as H)\r\n\r\nTHE WORDS.\r\n\r\n  I'm a Mark of judgment, of taste, and wit,\r\n    O'er a crowd of pages I rule the roast;\r\n  I mix with choice spirits, while choicer ones sit\r\n    Around, while I give them full many a toast.\r\n  Of my two words, my first is squeez'd into my second,\r\n  Although at its head it is commonly reckoned.\r\n\r\n\"When I read it to Mark Lemon,\" says Bede, in conclusion, \"he said that\r\n_Punch_ ought to be well flavoured, for that into its composition there\r\nwent not one, but three lemons--Mark Lemon, Leman Rede, and Laman\r\nBlanchard.\"\r\n\r\nEdward and his brother, Thomas Waldron Bradley, were sons of a surgeon\r\nof Kidderminster. When the former was quite a child, his delight in\r\nsketching was as remarkable as his keenness of observation, and he had a\r\ntrick on arriving home, after seeing anything that interested him in the\r\nstreets, of saying, \"Give me a slate,\" and sketching the scene upon it\r\nwith the utmost facility. It was this facility, joined to his lack of\r\nartistic education, which placed upon his work the unmistakable stamp of\r\nthe amateur. But his sense of humour saved him, winning for him\r\nadmittance to _Punch's_ pages in 1847, when he was only twenty years of\r\nage. He had made his début the previous year in \"Bentley's Miscellany,\"\r\nwith some love verses signed with his usual pen-name. Five years later\r\nhe was making suggestions for \"The Month,\" and both he and his brother\r\nWalrond (whose pseudonym of \"Shelsley Beauchamp\" is hardly yet forgotten\r\nin his own county) wrote in it.\r\n\r\nHis early MS. diaries record frequent receipts of small sums from\r\n_Punch_ in return for small contributions. His first draft upon the\r\nWhitefriars exchequer was on October 23rd, 1847, when one guinea was\r\nreceived. By 1853 the receipts were a little more frequent, but still\r\nhardly noteworthy. Here, at any rate, is an example:--\r\n\r\n  Up to August 4th, received from Mark Lemon for _Punch_--\r\n\r\n     Photo subjects                           £4  0 0\r\n     Table-turning                             0 10 0\r\n     Initial letter to Peterloo Brown, I.      3  0 0\r\n     Sidney Snub                               1 10 0\r\n     Savage Lions in London                    1  0 0\r\n\r\n  Sept. 14: 2nd and 3rd Peterloo Brown letters 6  5 0\r\n     Article \"High Mettle Dragon\".\r\n\r\n--while his earnings for the following year amount to £22 6s. for\r\ndrawings and MS. After 1856 he contributed nothing more to _Punch's_\r\npages, though a stray forgotten cut appears to have cropped up in the\r\nsecond volume for 1874.\r\n\r\nGeorge Cruikshank was a valuable friend to Cuthbert Bede, just as he was\r\nto Watts Phillips, and gave him a good deal of advice as to drawing on\r\nwood for _Punch_, as well as practical lessons in draughtsmanship, by\r\nworking before him on his wonderful etching of the \"Tail of a Comet;\"\r\nstill, he was unable to impart to his pupil's work either trained ease\r\nor style. Cruikshank was on terms of intimacy with Mark Lemon, but he\r\nnever drew for _Punch_, save indirectly for its advertisement page in\r\n1844--an announcement for his \"Table-Book,\" in which appear the\r\nportraits of Gilbert Abbott à Beckett (his literary Editor), Thackeray,\r\nand himself. Yet the \"Quarterly Review,\" in the course of an essay upon\r\nthat journal, declared that \"_Punch_ owes at least half its popularity\r\nto the pencil of George Cruikshank\"! The fact is, that Cruikshank,\r\nthough on intimate terms with many of the Staff, would never allow\r\nhimself to be persuaded to draw for its pages. \"We shall have you yet,\"\r\nsaid Mark Lemon one day. \"Never,\" said Cruikshank, in his most\r\nmelodramatic tone and striking his favourite attitude. He had then\r\nbecome the staunchest of total abstainers, and he held its very name in\r\nabhorrence. Moreover, he professed to look upon their Dinners as orgies;\r\nbut it is far more likely that the predominance in its pages and in its\r\ncouncils of his mighty rival, John Leech, had more to do with his total\r\nabstinence--from _Punch_, I mean--than any other consideration. \"Between\r\nCruikshank and Leech,\" says Mr. Frith, \"there existed little sympathy\r\nand less intimacy. The extravagant caricature that pervades so much of\r\nCruikshank's work, and from which Leech was entirely free, blinded him a\r\nlittle to the great merit of Cruikshank's serious work. I was very\r\nintimate with 'Immortal George,' as he was familiarly called, and I was\r\nmuch surprised by the coolness with which he received my enthusiastic\r\npraise of Leech. 'Yes, yes,' said George, 'very clever. The new school,\r\nyou see. Public always taken with novelty.'\" Nevertheless, it must not\r\nbe forgotten that the only lessons in etching Leech ever had he received\r\nfrom George Cruikshank. Moreover, George had a grievance, as will be\r\nseen by the following letter addressed to Mr. G. H. Haydon, one of\r\n_Punch's_ subsequent contributors, to whom reference will be made later\r\non:--\r\n\r\n                                           \"263, Hampstead Road, N.W.,\r\n                                                     January 7, 1867.\r\n\r\n  \"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry that I am not able to tell you where to find a 'Punch and\r\nJudy,' but I think some of that family reside, or might be heard of, in\r\nthe vicinity of Leicester Square. The 'Punch' that I copied my figures\r\nfrom for the 'History of Punch and Judy' was an old Italian long since\r\ndeceased. His performance and figures were first-rate--far superior to\r\nanything of the present day, and it is quite evident that poor Leech and\r\nothers copied _my_ Punch, for _Punch_ and other works, from the Punch\r\nthat I copied from this Italian Punch.\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of Punch, you are, I presume, aware that although the idea of\r\n'Punch' was taken from my 'Omnibus,' that I never had anything to do\r\nwith that work of 'Punch,' and also that for many years (20!!!) I have\r\nnot taken anything in the way of _Punch_.\r\n\r\n\"However, I will say no more about Punch at present, as I fear you will\r\nfeel as if you could 'punch' the head of\r\n\r\n                               \"Yours truly.\r\n\r\n                                    \"GEORGE CRUIKSHANK.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: T. HARRINGTON WILSON\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by T. W. Wilson, R.I._)]\r\n\r\nHis grievance was that _Punch's_ figure was stolen from his book (to\r\nwhich Payne Collier had written the text), and that the paper itself was\r\nbut an imitation of his own short-lived monthly magazine. With greater\r\nreason could he complain that the _Punch_ Pocket-books were copied from\r\nhis \"Comic Annuals,\" as they were, and that the imitations killed the\r\noriginals after a contest of a dozen years; but the idea of _Punch_\r\nbeing copied from the \"Omnibus,\" with which it had hardly a single point\r\nin common, save humour and illustration, has probably about as much\r\nfoundation as Cruikshank's claim against Dickens and \"Oliver Twist,\" or\r\nagainst Harrison Ainsworth and \"The Miser's Daughter\" and \"The Tower of\r\nLondon.\" Yet _Punch_ rendered ample tribute to his genius, not so much\r\nin the adaptation of many of his best-known drawings to cartoons,\r\nincluding \"Jack Sheppard\" (1841), \"Oliver asking for More\" (1844), \"The\r\nFix\" [Points of Humour] (1844), \"The Juggernaut\" (1845), \"Oliver Twist\r\nand the Artful Dodger\" (1846), \"The Deaf Postilion\" (1846), and \"Fagin\r\nin the Cell\" (1848), \"The Election\" [Sketches by Boz] down to \"Harcourt\r\nthe Headsman\" (June 8th, 1895); but also by deliberate statement and\r\namiability prepense. That, however, did not prevent _Punch_ from\r\nchaffing \"the Great George\" upon occasion, as when he was preparing his\r\n\"Life of Falstaff\" the journal gravely assumed that he would reform that\r\nincorrigible tippler into a \"teetotal Falstaff,\" and protested against\r\nthe enthusiast mixing water so copiously with the milk of his human\r\nkindness. So Cruikshank set off in great wrath towards Fleet Street to\r\nseek out the scoffer, and, meeting Blanchard Jerrold, sputtered out his\r\npurpose and declared that he was on the trail of that scoundrel _Punch_\r\nto \"knock his old wooden head about.\" When he died, _Punch_ announced\r\nthat \"England is the poorer by what she can ill spare--a man of genius.\r\nGood, kind, genial, honest, and enthusiastic George Cruikshank ... has\r\npassed away.\"\r\n\r\nMr. T. Harrington Wilson, the well-known special correspondent of the\r\n\"Illustrated London News,\" at that time a specialist in theatrical\r\nportraiture, joined the paper as an occasional contributor in 1853, and\r\nover various monograms sent in a dozen clever, but hardly striking,\r\ndrawings. These were \"socials\" dealing with society or fashion, stage\r\nsituations from behind the scenes, and grotesque ideas, such as the\r\n\"effect of wearing respirators on burglars\" (October, 1853). Mr.\r\nWilson--who, by the way, had studied at the National Gallery side by\r\nside with Sir John Tenniel and Charles Martin--contributed to the\r\nPocket-books from 1854 to 1857, and ceased his connection when he was\r\nordered abroad.\r\n\r\nAll the outside artistic help received by _Punch_ in 1854 came from five\r\noccasional correspondents: from \"F. M.,\" an amateur, in February; from\r\nMr. Swain the engraver (who fitfully contributed unimportant sketches at\r\ntimes of sudden need), in the same month; from J. Bennett; from Chambers\r\n(a half-a-dozen initials extending over that and the following year, and\r\nreappearing in 1864;) and from Mr. Harrison Weir. The contribution of\r\nthe latter occurred during Leech's indisposition, when Mr. Weir was\r\ninvited by Mark Lemon to make a few drawings to fill the place which\r\nwould be so sadly missed. So the artist--who was working under Lemon on\r\nthe \"Field\"--produced a half-page drawing illustrative of the\r\ntribulation of young lady who was obliged to leave half her luggage\r\nbehind by reason of the cab-strike; and it was printed on p. 163 of Vol.\r\nXXVII. Then Leech recovered, and Mr. Weir's services were dispensed\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThe second clergyman who ever drew for _Punch_ was the Rev. W. F.\r\nCallaway, a Baptist minister of York and Birmingham, and the son of a\r\ngentleman who had distinguished himself by writing a book on \"Cingalese\r\nGods.\" He contributed one or two sketches, the first one being referred\r\nto in his MS. diary, February 15th, 1855--\"Found my Sketch in\r\n_Punch_--'Comment on the Balaclava Railway.'\" It had been re-drawn in\r\npart by Leech, but the character of the original was left intact. Then\r\nthree initials from Ince are to be chronicled; another from \"W. R.,\" and\r\na drawing signed \"H.,\" from B. C. Halliday (p. 200, Vol. XXVIII),\r\nshowing \"Our Artist in the Crimea\" in a hopeless mess; as well as a\r\ndozen initials of no particular importance from G. W. Terry (p. 171,\r\nVol. XXX.) from 1856 to 1858.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Ashby-Sterry, so well and pleasantly known in later days as\r\n_Punch's_ \"Lazy Minstrel,\" and writer of verses and paragraphs\r\ninnumerable in its pages, was from 1856 to 1861 an artistic contributor\r\non fifteen occasions. \"When I was a youth,\" he writes, \"I fear I must\r\nhave annoyed good, genial Mark Lemon very much, for I was continually\r\nsending pen-and-ink sketches to _Punch_. Not content with showering\r\nthese upon him, which were invariably courteously returned, I began to\r\npelt him with wood blocks. I took to drawing on the wood\r\nenthusiastically, and was continually popping these little parcels into\r\nthe letter-box under the shadow of St. Bride's Church. At last one of\r\nthem, to my intense joy, appeared. Altogether I must have had about four\r\ninitial letters, a dozen black silhouettes, and a quarter-page social\r\ncut inserted in the paper. But the quantity that were never used at all,\r\nand the number that were re-drawn by my old friend Charles Keene, is a\r\nhigh testimony to the artistic knowledge and editorial skill of Mark\r\nLemon.\" But Mr. Ashby-Sterry does himself an injustice, as all will say\r\nwho have seen the vivacious sketch of a gentleman struggling violently\r\ninside his shirt, with the legend: \"How agreeable it is, more especially\r\nif you are late, and are dressing against time to dine with\r\nultra-punctual people--how agreeable it is, on getting into your clean\r\nshirt, to find the laundress has been careful to fasten all the buttons\r\nfor you!\" Moreover, he was trained as an artist, both at \"the Langham\"\r\nand at the Royal Academy Schools; and portraits painted by him of his\r\nfather and grandfather have long since \"toned\" into canvases at once\r\nable and attractive.\r\n\r\nA few sketches by Saunderson in this same year were followed by the\r\ndébut of Alfred Thompson. When a cavalry officer, this gentleman,\r\nencouraged by the acceptance of his work by \"Diogenes,\" in 1854, sent a\r\nfew drawings--initials, for the most part--to _Punch_, that were\r\npublished in 1856-7-8, and he was persuaded by Mark Lemon to take up the\r\ncareer of art. On retiring from the service, he studied in Paris, and\r\ncontributed to the \"Journal Amusant;\" and on his return found that Mark\r\nLemon was dead, and that, by the side of Keene and Tenniel, there had\r\ngrown up a giant in the person of Mr. du Maurier. Under Tom Taylor's\r\neditorship he was a regular literary contributor, and was promised the\r\nnext vacant place on the Staff; but an offer from Messrs. Agnew of the\r\nmanagement of the Theatre Royal, Manchester, tempted him away from\r\nLondon and all journalistic enterprise. On his return to town, Mr.\r\nBurnand was on the point of becoming Editor, and the connection came to\r\nan end. And so _Punch_ knew him no more, and Mr. Thompson appeared\r\nbefore a later generation chiefly as editor of the brilliant little\r\n\"Mask,\" as designer of stage costumes and ballets, and writer of\r\npantomimes. By some he was also remembered as a contributor, in 1865, to\r\nthe \"Comic News\" and \"The Arrow.\" His last _Punch_ sketches were\r\npublished in 1876 and 1877, and in the Pocket-book for the latter year\r\nwas buried what was, perhaps, his most important literary contribution\r\nthat is worth preserving--a continuation of \"Daniel Deronda.\" The most\r\nthat can be said of Mr. Thompson's sketches is that they are bright and\r\nnot without fancy; but since these were made, his power and charm of\r\ngrace greatly increased. He died in New Jersey, September, 1895.\r\n\r\nFrank Bellew, whose signature consisted of a flattened triangle, either\r\nwith or without his initials, drew about thirty initials and quarter- or\r\nhalf-page \"socials\" from 1857 until 1862, many of them dealing with\r\nincidents connected with the American Civil War; and then--following the\r\nexample of Newman and Mr. Thompson--he went to America, where he\r\nobtained more recognition for his clever outline drawings and for the\r\npathetic touches and moral points which he loved to introduce; and\r\nthere he begat a son whose reputation as a humorous draughtsman (being\r\n\"Chip\" of the New York \"Life\") soon became far greater than his\r\nfather's. Bennet and \"B. W.\" followed with a few trifles in 1857 and\r\n1858, and then on October 13th Julian Portch sent in his first\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\nPortch sprang from humble surroundings, and with no recommendations but\r\nhis art; that, however, was sufficient for Mark Lemon. It is true that\r\nit lacked strength, but it showed a delicate pencil and a certain power\r\nof comic expression sufficient to place him among \"Mr. Punch's clever\r\nyoung men\" of the second rank. He was forthwith employed on decorations\r\nto the preface and to the Pocket-book (a task on which he was engaged\r\nfor several consecutive years), as well as on _Punch_ itself. He stopped\r\nactive contribution in 1862, his work being seen only once in 1863,\r\n1864, 1867, and 1870; but the last drawing he sent in was in October,\r\n1861. He had illustrated \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" a new edition of Boswell's\r\n\"Life of Johnson,\" and, in part, Mr. Cholmondeley Pennell's \"Puck on\r\nPegasus,\" when in 1855 Henry Vizetelly, whose pupil he had been, sent\r\nhim to the Crimea as war correspondent for the \"Illustrated Times,\" in\r\norder to make sketches of British camp life. In the rigours of that\r\nawful winter he was laid low with rheumatic fever, ending in general\r\nparalysis; and after three years of lovingly tended illness he died in\r\nSeptember, 1865.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous contributor, more than usually modest, then sent in three\r\ndrawings (August, 1859) as from \"A Stranger,\" and then the distinguished\r\nFrench caricaturist, \"Cham\" (the Comte Amédée de Noé), made six humorous\r\nand spirited character sketches of Turco soldiers in Paris in 1859, not\r\nvery complimentary to his country's allies. When he had visited London\r\npreviously, Mark Lemon had sent him a little parcel of wood-blocks for\r\ndrawings for _Punch_, and was astonished to receive them all back the\r\nnext morning, all covered with vigorous work, with a calm request for\r\n\"more woods.\" He was, perhaps, a better _raconteur_ than comic\r\ndraughtsman, and, speaking English thoroughly well, became at once a\r\ngreat favourite. Thackeray, in particular, delighted to do him honour in\r\nhis rooms at Young Street. In the same year Brunton, a young artist far\r\nbetter known outside _Punch's_ pages than in them, put his sign-manual\r\nof arrow-pierced hearts to a couple of drawings; and it is curious to\r\nobserve how in his \"Annamite Ambassadors\" he forestalled Mr. Furniss's\r\n\"Lika Joko\" series.\r\n\r\nMiss Coode was the first lady who drew for _Punch_, contributing\r\nnineteen drawings from November, 1859, to January, 1861; and then G. H.\r\nHaydon (barrister-at-law and steward of Bridewell and the Royal\r\nBethlehem Hospital) began his connection. He was the intimate friend of\r\nJohn Leech, by whom he was introduced to _Punch_, and of Charles Keene,\r\nwith whom he used to draw regularly at the Langham Sketching Club.\r\nDuring 1860-1-2 he contributed twenty-two sketches and initials. He was\r\na keen fly-fisherman, and many of Leech's subjects of this sort were\r\ndone with him at Whitchurch, Hampshire, which they haunted together for\r\nthe sport. After Leech's death Haydon contributed nothing more, as it\r\nwas only during his spare time and out of friendly feeling that he made\r\nhis sketches. He was, on the other hand, the subject of several of\r\nKeene's angling drawings, which were also done for the most part at\r\nWhitchurch. Such is the sketch in the Almanac for 1885, wherein the\r\n\"Gigantic Angler\" is an excellent portrait of Haydon, while Leech's\r\ndrawing of August 11th, 1860, was a record of an incident that happened\r\nwhile the friends were fishing the same water. From that extremely\r\npromising young artist, M. J. Lawless, who was doing some of his best\r\ndesigns for \"Once a Week,\" there came between May, 1860, and the\r\nfollowing January, six drawings; but he was already a dying man when\r\nthey were done, and he left little proof in them of the greatness of his\r\ntalent. He was still contributing, however, when, on September 28th,\r\n1860, there was sent into the office a drawing from the hand of one of\r\nthe most brilliant of _Punch's_ lights--George du Maurier.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[55] See Mr. Layard's \"Life and Letters of Charles Keene,\" p. 387.\r\n\r\n[56] Speech at Royal Academy Banquet, May 2nd, 1891.\r\n\r\n[57] English humour is under a great debt to the English Church. Not\r\nonly, of course, are Sydney Smith and \"Tom Ingoldsby\" of immortal\r\nfame--to name no others--in the front rank of our wits, but _Punch_ has\r\nreceived the homage of \"Cuthbert Bede,\" Dean Hole, the Rev. W. F.\r\nCallaway, Canon Ainger, and the Rev. Anthony C. Deane. The Irish\r\nCatholic priest Father James Healy, by the way, indirectly contributed a\r\nnumber of capital jokes.\r\n\r\n[58] It is to be observed, however, that there is no mention of these\r\nengravings in Mr. Swain's \"_Punch_ Cut Book.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n_PUNCH'S_ ARTISTS: 1860-67.\r\n\r\n     Mr. G. du Maurier's First Drawing--The \"Romantic Tenor\"--Polite\r\n     Satire--His Types and Creations--His Pretty Women--And Fair\r\n     American--\"Chang,\" \"Don,\" and \"Punch\"--Mr. du Maurier as a _Punch_\r\n     Writer--Mr. Gordon Thompson--Mr. Stacy Marks, R.A.--Paul Gray--Sir\r\n     John Millais, Bart., R.A.--Mr. Fred Barnard--First Joke Refused as\r\n     \"Painful\"--Mr. R.

Downey._)]\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1860, Mr. George Louis Palmella Busson du Maurier contributed\r\nhis first drawing to _Punch_, he had little suspicion that he would be\r\ncounted, together with John Leech, John Tenniel, and Charles Keene, as\r\none of the four great pillars on which would rest the artistic\r\nreputation of the paper. In that first drawing, himself and two of his\r\nfriends were represented entering the \"studio\" of a photographer,\r\nsmoking, as the manner of artists is; and they are coldly requested by\r\nthe deity of the place to leave their tobacco outside, as \"they are in\r\nan artist's studio\" (p. 150, Vol. XXXIX.). It was a poor sketch enough,\r\nshowing some straining after comicality, and lacking every trace of the\r\ngrace and beauty the draughtsman was so soon to develop. He was Parisian\r\nborn, and after studying with a view to a scientific career, he became\r\nconvinced, through Dr. Williamson's amiable assurance that he would make\r\na \"shocking bad chemist,\" that art and not science was his\r\ndestiny--more especially as his professors had been delighted with such\r\nlittle caricatures of his as they had seen; but, as Mr. du Maurier\r\nsuggestively put it in his lecture on \"Social Pictorial Satire,\" \"they\r\nhad not seen them _all_.\" He studied art at Antwerp and Paris in company\r\nwith several notabilities of the day; but when, through an accident in\r\nthe laboratory, he lost the sight of one eye, and found the other\r\nseriously imperilled, his chances of success in life seemed small. It\r\nwas when lying, during his long illness, in the Antwerp Hospital, in\r\n1858, that he first saw \"Punch's Almanac\"--a delight which he never\r\nforgot. When he recovered his ordinary health, he returned to England,\r\nthough with little improvement of sight to cheer him. With a courage,\r\nhowever, equal to that of Sir John Tenniel, he girded himself against\r\nfate; he worked hard in London, where he lived in humble lodgings at 85,\r\nNewman Street, which he shared with his life-long friend, the late\r\nLionel Henley, afterwards R.B.A.--\"the dearest fellow that ever was.\" He\r\nsometimes wondered, he has told me, if he would eat a dinner that day;\r\nand as becomes the impecunious, he was a tremendous democrat. He \"hated\r\nthe bloated aristocracy, without knowing much about it; and, to do it\r\njustice, the bloated aristocracy did not go out of its way to pester him\r\nwith its attentions.\" But in those happy, hungry, hard-working days,\r\nwhen dinner was not always a vested interest, Mr. du Maurier seemed\r\nalready tinged with the daintier tastes that were destined to lead his\r\npencil to the delineation of these same \"bloated\" classes; and even in\r\nthose hard times he could always boast a dress-suit.\r\n\r\nSo at the age of twenty-six--the same as that at which Charles Keene\r\nmade his début in _Punch_--he sent in an occasional contribution that\r\nwas far more in Leech's manner than in what came to be his own.\r\n\r\nArt has a way, figuratively speaking, of flourishing on an empty\r\nstomach, and Mr. du Maurier made rapid progress on the training. Keene's\r\nacquaintance and genial friendship enslaved at once his artistic\r\nmethods, as well as his artistic adoration. It was not that he admired\r\nLeech less, but that he appreciated Keene more; and when the former\r\ndied, to the sorrow and consternation of the Staff, Mr. du Maurier was\r\nappointed to his seat at the Table. He obeyed the summons on the first\r\nWednesday that followed Leech's death, and carved his monogram on the\r\nboard between those of the bosom friends, Thackeray and Leech. Mark\r\nLemon, with characteristic shrewdness, soon discovered in what direction\r\nlay the talent and perhaps the _penchant_ of the artist, and told him\r\nnot to try to be \"too funny,\" but to do the graceful side of things, and\r\nto be \"the romantic tenor in Mr. Punch's opera bouffe company,\" while\r\nKeene was to do the comic songs. The little social dramas of the day,\r\nthe drawing-rooms of Belgravia, and the nurseries of Mayfair--those were\r\nhis preserves, from which he could get as much game as he chose,\r\nhumorous if he liked, but graceful withal.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. du Maurier is emphatically not what is commonly understood by \"a\r\nfunny man,\" for all his subtlety and love of humour; he is a combination\r\nof the artistic, with a distinct and clear sense of beauty, and of the\r\nscientific, with speculations and theories of race and heredity--who\r\nwould as lief draw East-End types for the sake of their \"character,\" and\r\nwould look at a queer face more for the interest that is in it than for\r\nits comicality. If Mr. du Maurier's sense of beauty is strong, so is his\r\nappreciation of ugliness; and if you take down any of the volumes of\r\n_Punch_--that shine in their shelves like the teeth in the great\r\nlaughing mouth of Humour itself--you will find no faces or forms more\r\nhideous or grotesque than those which the artist has chosen to put\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nBut if there is one thing to justify the opinion of his admirers that he\r\nis the \"Thackeray of the pencil,\" it is primarily to be found, not so\r\nmuch in the keen satire of his drawing and legends, but in his\r\nstartling, his strikingly truthful creations. Creations we have had from\r\nLeech, Keene, and others--from Leech's pure sense of fun and jollity;\r\nfrom Keene's unerring observation of men and women, and fleeting\r\nemotion--but those of Mr. du Maurier go deeper into vices, virtues,\r\nhabits, and motives, and are at the root of his pictorial commentaries.\r\nHe has given us true pictures of the manners of his time; and those\r\nmanners he has satirised with more politeness and irony, perhaps, than\r\nbroad humour. He worked well with Keene in double harness, and his\r\npictures are at once a foil and a complement of that genius's work and\r\n_point de vue_. He has satirised everything, and his art has been\r\nadmirably adapted to the depth of the civilisation he probes and\r\ndissects. His sense of beauty and tenderness apart, he is to art much\r\nwhat Corney Grain was to the stage, though his hand is not so heavy; and\r\nwhile you laugh with Leech, you smile with Mr. du Maurier--lovingly at\r\nhis children, respectfully at his pretty women, and sardonically at his\r\nsocial puppets.\r\n\r\nHis own particular creations--his types and \"series\"--are to some\r\nsections of _Punch's_ admirers, _Punch's_ chief attraction. Especially\r\nis this the case in the United States,[59] where to Mr. du Maurier many\r\npeople have looked almost exclusively, not only for English fashions in\r\nmale and female attire, and the _dernière mode_ in social etiquette, but\r\nfor the truest reflection of English life and character. First of all\r\nthese types are Sir Gorgius Midas--who, the artist once confided to me,\r\nwas drawn without exaggeration from real life--and his common wife and\r\nstill vulgarer son. Then Mrs. Ponsonby de Tomkyns, the clever and\r\nscheming, and her husband, depressed and stolidly obedient; the bishop\r\nand the flunkey, all calves and dignity; Grigsby, the \"comic\" man, and\r\nhis punctilious friend, Sir Pompey Bedell, inflated with pretentious\r\nemptiness; 'Arry and 'Arriet, blatant and irrepressible; young Cadby,\r\nthe Cockney; and the Duke and Duchess of Stilton, whose very figures\r\nseem to be drawn in purple ink; the refined colonel, a counterpart and\r\nnot unworthy comrade of Newcome himself; Maudle, Postlethwaite, and Mrs.\r\nCimabue Brown, most delightful trio of sickening \"æsthetes\"--specially\r\nbeloved of Mr. du Maurier, whose famous drawing, \"Are You Intense?\" is\r\nperhaps the particular favourite of all his satiric _Punch_ work; Mr.\r\nSoapley and Mr. Todeson, who vie with each other in vulgar servility\r\nand sycophancy; the Herr Professor, ponderously humorous in smoking-room\r\nor boudoir; and Anatole, the bridegroom, happy and dapper in the Bois de\r\nBoulogne; Titwillow and the ex-Jew at the Club--what an assemblage of\r\ncarefully differentiated specimens of London's characteristic\r\ninhabitants! That many of them are often accepted, universally quoted as\r\ntypes, apart from any express reference to _Punch_ or to its artist, is\r\nthe best testimony of the truth of his irony; for they are as\r\nrecognisable in the real world as the Jacques, the Becky Sharps, and the\r\nPecksniffs of other brains. And besides these there are the general\r\ncharacters so accurately presented to us--the refined lady with the very\r\nold face and frontal grey or white curls whom Mr. du Maurier used to\r\ndraw, I believe, from the person of Mrs. Hamilton Aädé; the charming\r\nyoung ladies for whom, in succession, his wife and daughters have sat;\r\nand the delightful little ones to whom Professor Ruskin paid partial\r\ntribute when he declared, a little cruelly, perhaps, that the \"charm of\r\nhis extremely intelligent, and often exquisitely pretty children, is\r\ndependent, for the greater part, on the dressing of their back hair and\r\nthe fitting of their boots.\"\r\n\r\nThe admirable setting in which Mr. du Maurier frames his series of jokes\r\nis testimony to his genius. He follows Leech's plan of such series\r\n(\"Servantgalism,\" \"The Rising Generation,\" etc.), but the quality of the\r\nthought and its presentation is as much more elaborate than Leech's as\r\nhis method of draughtsmanship is more complicated. These series or\r\nformulæ, in their chief heads and subtle variations, display the quality\r\nof his mind. If you turn to the volumes for 1888 (XCIV. and XCV.) you\r\nwill find examples of no fewer than nine of them: (1) Things one would\r\nrather have left unsaid; (2) Things one would rather have expressed\r\ndifferently; (3) Social Agonies; (4) Feline Amenities; (5) Our\r\nImbeciles; (6) Typical Modern Developments; (7) Studies in Evolution;\r\n(8) Nincompoopiana; and (9) What our Artist has to put up with;--the\r\nlast-named, however, a vein which Keene began to work as early as 1854.\r\n\r\nHis talent, too, in devising the legends, or \"cackle,\" for the drawings\r\nis uniformly happy, unsurpassed by any man who ever wrote for _Punch_.\r\nAs Mr. Anstey says, he has brought the art of _précis_-writing to\r\nperfection. His legends are not always so concise as Leech's, but for\r\ntruth of expression, felicitous colloquialism, and above all, for\r\nforeign accent, he is unapproached. I go farther, and say that he is the\r\nfirst man who ever put truthfully upon paper, and properly\r\ndifferentiated, the \"broken English\" and slangy mispronunciations of\r\nGerman, French, and Semite, to say nothing of his Cockney; indeed, his\r\nstudies in this direction prove him, besides an admirable physiologist\r\n_pour rire_ and a pungent though courteous satirist, an inimitable\r\ncomparative-\"broken\"-philologist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"MY PRETTY WOMAN.\"\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by George du Maurier._)]\r\n\r\nTrue to his _rôle_ of \"Romantic Tenor,\" Mr. du Maurier has endowed\r\n_Punch_ with the greater part of the grace and beauty which have done so\r\nmuch to make the paper what it is. \"In his social subjects,\" says a\r\ndistinguished critic,[60] \"Mr. du Maurier, though somewhat mannered and\r\nfond of a single type of face and figure, has carried the ironical\r\n_genre_, received by Leech from Gavarni and Charlet, to the highest\r\npoint of elegance it has attained.\" He is too fond of the beautiful,\r\nsighs Mr. James; he sees everything _en beau_, and Mistress and Maid\r\nwith him are a good deal of Juno and Hebe. No doubt his grace often\r\nmilitates against his fun, but Mr. du Maurier, as has already been\r\nsuggested, is only by accident a professional funny man. Besides, when\r\nhe wishes to be merely funny, he passes Beauty by as if he were not the\r\nmost devoted of her adorers, as you may see in one of the best of all\r\nhis drawings in _Punch_, in which a typically selfish master of the\r\nhouse orders up the cook into the breakfast-room, complaining that he\r\ncannot eat the bacon which he has just served; his wife's, he says, is\r\nthe worst he ever saw--and _his own is nearly as bad_!\r\n\r\nEven more than his lovely child (often drawn from his little grandson),\r\nhis superb youth, and his splendid gentleman, Mr. du Maurier's pretty\r\nwoman is the pedestal upon which he has erected his reputation--at\r\nleast, so far as _Punch_ is concerned. His pretty woman, he declares, is\r\nthe granddaughter of Leech's, and he beseeches the public to love her,\r\npaternally at least as he does, \"for her grandmother's sake.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PENCIL STUDY FOR \"PUNCH\" PICTURE.\r\n\r\n(_By George du Maurier._)]\r\n\r\nWriting his mind on the subject of his delightful creation at my own\r\nrequest,[61] he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"I do hope the reader does not dislike her--that is, if he knows\r\n     her. I am so fond of her myself, or, rather, so fond of what I\r\n     _want_ her to be. She is my _pièce de résistance_, and I have often\r\n     heard her commended, and the praise of her has sounded sweet in\r\n     mine ears, and gone straight to my heart, for she has become to me\r\n     as a daughter. She is rather tall, I admit, and a trifle stiff; but\r\n     English women are tall and stiff just now; and she is rather too\r\n     serious; but that is only because I find it so difficult, with a\r\n     mere stroke in black ink, to indicate the enchanting little curved\r\n     lines that go from the nose to the mouth-corners, causing the\r\n     cheeks to make a smile--and without them the smile is\r\n     incomplete--merely a grin. And as for height, I have often begun by\r\n     drawing the dear creature little, and found that by one sweep of\r\n     the pen (adding a few inches to the bottom of her skirt) I have\r\n     improved her so much that it has been impossible to resist the\r\n     temptation--the thing is so easy, and the result so satisfying and\r\n     immediate.\"\r\n\r\nNowadays, he has declared, girls are no longer pretty--they are\r\nbeautiful; and as Mr. Galton, the anthropometrical expert, himself\r\nadmits, they, even more than the rest of mankind, have certainly grown\r\ntaller. The artist, as we have seen, invented the tall woman; the\r\nPsyches of our fathers' days have become the Venuses and Junos of these;\r\nand more than one writer has gravely sought to fix the responsibility,\r\nor the credit, on Mr. du Maurier and his pencil. Scientific\r\ninvestigation has taught us that the English girl tops her foreign\r\nsisters, though her average weight is two pounds less than that of the\r\nfair American; and there is little doubt that if she does not absolutely\r\nadapt her height to the artist's sense of beauty and power of\r\ninspiration, she has at least to thank him for making it fashionable.\r\nThe truth of the matter is that Mr. du Maurier has always been a close\r\nobserver; and just as his drawings have always been in the fashion in\r\npoint of dress through his careful watching of the changing wardrobe of\r\nhis wife and daughters, so was he the first to record the increasing\r\nstature of English girls, even while Leech was still drawing them as he\r\nhad known them--short and buxom and \"plump little dumplings\"--never\r\nrecognising that they had been deposed by Fashion and improved by\r\nNature. But the race changed, and _Punch_ changed with them. Venus was\r\nVenus once more, and Mr. du Maurier was her Prophet.\r\n\r\n\"And the old ladies!\" proceeds Mr. du Maurier; \"it is such a pleasure to\r\ndraw them, and do one's best. To think of all the charming old ladies\r\none has known, and (according to one's letterpress) to select the chin\r\nof one, the white curls of another, the mouth and nose of a third, and\r\nthen to make a subtle arrangement in sweet sympathetic wrinkles--too\r\noften to be subtly disarranged by the engraver and the printer!\r\n\r\n\"Then we get to the male characters, and there it is comparatively plain\r\nsailing; and would be pleasant sailing enough but for the hideousness of\r\ncertain portions of the modern male attire. However new, however good\r\nthe tailor, however comely the leg beneath, the TROUSER is the one\r\nheart-breaking object to the conscientious but æsthetically-minded\r\ndraughtsman on wood! It ignores the knee, and falls on the boot in a\r\nshape that has no reference to the ankle whatever--a shape of its\r\nown--and yet the ankle is the foundation of everything!\r\n\r\n\"Next in order of demerit and impossibility comes the chimney-pot hat,\r\nwhich is not lacking in character, but is ugly and ridiculous. Its one\r\nredeeming feature is the difficulty it presents to the draughtsman. It\r\nis mathematical, geometrical, with every curve known to science, as hard\r\nto represent correctly as a boat or a fiddle--more so; and the delight\r\nof successful achievement is proportionately great. Linley Sambourne\r\nalone, who was originally trained as an engineer, has been able to\r\ngrapple with the chimney-pot hat; Walker all but succeeded by the sheer\r\nforce of his heaven-born genius.\"\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of all this beauty, surely his misrepresentation of\r\nthat divinity--the American Girl--is beyond all hope of pardon,\r\nbeyond contrition, beyond all penance. He does full justice to her\r\nrefined and splendid loveliness and her magnificent proportions;\r\nbut he seems to regard her, if one may say so, as a sort of\r\nKensington-Town-Hall-Subscription-Dance young lady, a little more\r\n_outrée_ and free and slangy and vulgar. She guesses in the ballroom\r\nthat English partners don't \"bunch\" (give bouquets); when invited to go\r\nin to supper she avers, not without a sense of inward satisfaction, that\r\nshe is \"pretty crowded already;\" she has a deep though entirely a\r\ntourist's interest in English institutions, ruins, and celebrities; she\r\nhas little reverence else for what is in the heavens above or the earth\r\nbeneath; and she dearly loves a lord--or she would, if by any\r\nhonourable means she can obtain the chance. His American girls, too,\r\nall come from one and the same place; they are all born from one and the\r\nsame mother; their natural cleverness and unnatural ignorance are\r\ncompounded in the same proportions, and, altogether, they are the most\r\ncharming and delightful libels on American young-womanhood that well\r\ncould be. But is his representation of the American girl any less\r\npleasant than the common, home-made American view of an English\r\ngentleman--at least, of an English \"swell\"? Not at all. On the contrary,\r\nshe is, as I said before, a divinity.\r\n\r\nMore than once Mr. du Maurier has broken away from his light comedy\r\n_rôle_ and, besides giving vent to his fantastic power in his wonderful\r\n\"Night-mares,\" has given us something with serious thought, and, now and\r\nagain, with tragedy in it--has offered us, indeed, a taste of the\r\ndeepest poetic quality that he has shown in his novels of \"Peter\r\nIbbetson\" and \"Trilby.\" You may see a touch of it in Tenniel's great\r\ncartoon at the outbreak of hostilities between France and Germany, in\r\nwhich the great Napoleon stands warningly in the path of the infatuated\r\nEmperor; that was du Maurier's suggestion. You may see a touch of it in\r\nthe page drawing of \"Old Nickotin Stealing Away the Brains of His\r\nDevotees\" (1868), in which a circle of strange men, whose own heads are\r\ntheir pipe-bowls, smoke away their brains through long tubes that work\r\nwell into the composition, while, in the foreground, one of the poor\r\nfoolish wretches drops, just as a last little curling puff rises from\r\nhis smoked-out skull. There were more of such compositions before 1880,\r\nat the time when Mr. du Maurier was still making full-page drawings in\r\n_Punch_. But, after all, it is not in _Punch_, but rather in the\r\n\"Cornhill Magazine\" and \"Once a Week,\" in \"Esmond,\" and other\r\nworks--particularly in the \"Illustrated Magazine\"--that his full power\r\nin serious work must be sought.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ruskin, after declaring that the \"terrific force\" of Mr. du\r\nMaurier's satire of character in face and figure consists in the\r\n_absence_ of caricature, describes as \"cruelly true\" the design\r\n\"representing the London mechanic with his family when Mr. Todeson is\r\nasked to amuse 'the dear creatures' at Lady Clara's garden tea;\" and\r\nproclaims the artist more exemplary than either John Leech or John\r\nTenniel (\"the real founders of _Punch_, and by far the greatest of its\r\nillustrators both in force of art and range of thought\") \"in the\r\nprecision of the use of his means, and the subtle boldness to which he\r\nhas educated the interpreter of his design.\"[62] In point of fact, the\r\nengraver has had to \"interpret\" Mr. du Maurier's drawings far less than\r\nthose of many of his colleagues, for his line is too delicate,\r\nsympathetic, and precise to leave room for anything but the strictest\r\npossible facsimile. This was quite as true in the old days when he drew\r\nupon the block, as in later times, when, yielding to the stern demands\r\nof failing eyesight--which, for a period, forced him to suspend work\r\naltogether--he drew with the pen upon paper several times larger than\r\nthe ultimate reduction effected by means of photography. It is curious\r\nin tracing his hand through _Punch_ to see how his work gradually\r\nstrengthened; how his early vigour of subject and activity of mind,\r\nexpressed in strong black-and-white, gave way to a daintier touch when\r\nthe grace and prettiness of his _dramatis personæ_ came to demand\r\ngreater refinement of the drawn line; and how this again constantly\r\nwidened out into a broader method, under the inspiration of Charles\r\nKeene. And yet from first to last, in the smallest sketch as in the most\r\nelaborate picture, his hand is unmistakable.\r\n\r\nIn common with Keene and others, Mr. du Maurier has suffered from time\r\nto time from printers' errors. One of the most curious, perhaps, is that\r\nin which three little boys are shown in a drawing playing upon a sofa,\r\nevidently very much in the way of their elder sister, who is receiving a\r\nvisit from an admirer. The sister asks her brothers with pardonable\r\npoint if they will not go and play downstairs. No, the oldest replies,\r\nMamma has sent them up \"to play forfeits.\" The joke, utterly pointless\r\nas printed, becomes intelligible when it is explained that \"forfeits\"\r\nis an error for \"propriety.\" Many of the artist's jokes, as already\r\nexplained, have come from various friends; indeed, in this case, they\r\nare probably less often manufactured than in that of others. All the\r\nsame, it may be of interest to record that the oft-quoted joke of the\r\næsthetic young couple who agreed that they must \"live up to\" their blue\r\nand white tea-pot, was not \"made up,\" but was spoken in downright,\r\nimbecile earnest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"CHANG.\"\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by G. du Maurier. By Courtesy of the Fine Art Society._)]\r\n\r\nLike Keene, too, Mr. du Maurier loved to put his own dogs into _Punch_.\r\nWhether it was his magnificent St. Bernard, \"Chang,\" whose seven-foot\r\nskeleton now graces the Royal College of Surgeons, or his little\r\nterrier, \"Don,\" or his dachshund, \"Punch,\" they have all played their\r\npart in public and justified their existence as models, and have in\r\ntheir time been the pets as much of you and me as of their legal owner.\r\nBut, for all his connoisseurship in dogs, Mr. du Maurier is woefully\r\ndeficient in certain forms of sportsmanlike knowledge, and could he but\r\nhave heard the howls in the cricket world a few years since when he\r\nventured on depicting a \"mixed match,\" and showed the wickets about\r\nforty yards apart, he would almost have wished the excellent joke\r\nuntold. Herein, of course, he was not more ignorant than his friend\r\nKeene, who had to be specially coached (yet with what disastrous\r\nresults!) when he wished to present a picture involving the \"placing\" of\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"DON.\"\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by G. du Maurier._)]\r\n\r\nApart from his artistic services to _Punch_, Mr. du Maurier has been a\r\ncontributor to its pages of verse and prose, comparable with some of the\r\nbest that has appeared there. Who can forget his admirable\r\nnonsense-verses, his \"_Vers Nonsensiques à l'usage des Familles\r\nAnglaises_,\" or his exquisite fooling in his \"Shalott\" poem, or his\r\n\"Alphabet\" verses, or his _vers de société_? They worthily heralded the\r\nnovelist as we know him now, who is also the author of one of the most\r\nbrilliant lectures--brimming over with happy thought and sparkling\r\nepigram--that have been composed in recent years. It is by his long,\r\nvaried, and effective service that Mr. du Maurier has to be recognised\r\nas one of the four artists--Leech, Keene, and Tenniel being the\r\nothers--who bore the chief share in raising _Punch_ to his pinnacle, and\r\nhe is to be named with Keene as a truthful recorder of the life and\r\nhumours of Society during the last forty years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. But if it is for this achievement, and for his delightful\r\ngenius that he is primarily esteemed in Whitefriars and throughout the\r\nEnglish-speaking world, it is for himself and his own good-humour that\r\n\"Kiki\"--as he is known to his intimates--has been regarded with\r\naffection and admiration by his colleagues during the long period of his\r\nhonourable, dignified, and brilliant connection.\r\n\r\nFor the space of one-and-twenty years--a period which drew to a close in\r\n1895--Mr. du Maurier has lived and worked in his house near Hampstead\r\nHeath, from which he has wrought so many backgrounds for his _Punch_\r\npictures. Whitby, Scarborough, Boulogne, as well as Paris and London,\r\nhave oftentimes afforded him local colour; but you get to learn\r\nHampstead as you look at his drawings better than any of the others, and\r\nto know his sanctum--his salon-studio. Its characteristic bits, its\r\nbow-window, its Late-Gothic fireplace, its window-seat, are all\r\nfamiliar. And here the artist's model has latterly been the\r\ndraughtsman's more constant companion, for \"the older I grow,\" says Mr.\r\ndu Maurier, \"the more careful, the more of a student I become.\" So, for\r\nevery _Punch_ drawing he now makes beautiful pencil studies which, in my\r\nopinion, are even more delightful and more dainty than the pen-and-ink\r\npictures they assist in perfecting. Examples of these studies,\r\naccurately and simply drawn, are here reproduced, and they will be seen\r\nto reveal the draughtsman's graceful artistry more completely than any\r\nother work in his recognised medium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PENCIL STUDY FOR \"PUNCH\" PICTURE.\r\n\r\n(_By George du Maurier._)]\r\n\r\nIt was in the year following Mr. du Maurier's début that Mr. John Gordon\r\nThompson began his short connection with _Punch_. He was a very young\r\nman, and these drawings were almost his earliest work. He was at that\r\ntime studying for the Civil Service, and after his appointment to\r\nSomerset House he discontinued to a great extent his artistic efforts;\r\nbut when he left the Service in 1870 he resumed the pencil, and became,\r\nand remained for twenty years without one week's break, the cartoonist\r\nof \"Fun.\" His style was not yet formed when he contributed to _Punch_,\r\nand his three-and-thirty socials, all published by 1864, gave little\r\npromise of the ability he afterwards displayed in the papers, magazines\r\nand books innumerable which he illustrated with such furious ardour.\r\n\r\nMr. H. Stacy Marks, R.A., also made his appearance in the paper in 1861,\r\nwith a design for an architectural hat of Tudor-Gothic order, fitted\r\nwith gargoyles round the brim for rainy weather. He also made an initial\r\n\"I,\" and then was seen in _Punch_ no more until the Almanac for 1882,\r\nwhen he made a full-page ornithological drawing of \"Up before the Beak.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PENCIL STUDY FOR \"PUNCH\" PICTURE.\r\n\r\n(_By George du Maurier._)]\r\n\r\nPaul Gray was another of _Punch's_ promising contributors fated to an\r\nearly death. He began with a few initials--a couple of \"A's\" were his\r\nfirst little feat, one of them made out of an old woman and a bathing\r\nmachine. Then came \"socials\" up to 1865, which attracted attention for\r\ntheir grace, in spite of their lack of backbone; but after a variety of\r\nwork, including drawings for the \"Argosy\" and illustrations for\r\nKingsley's \"Hereward,\" his pencil was laid down, and he was no more than\r\ntwenty-five when he died.\r\n\r\nHalf-a-dozen sketches by Harris in 1863 were followed by Sir John\r\nMillais' first contribution--a mock-heroic illustration to Mr. Burnand's\r\n\"Mokeanna\" (p. 115, Vol. XLIV.). The distinguished artist repeated his\r\nunusual experience in the Almanac for 1865, when in a technically\r\nexquisite drawing he showed a couple of children in a studio assaulting\r\nthe lay figure. There were other pictures by which Sir John figured\r\nindirectly in _Punch_. As one of the most intimate friends of John\r\nLeech, he took the liveliest interest in his work. \"Once,\" he informs\r\nme, \"I forwarded two drawings to Leech from Scotland, and he traced them\r\non to the wood and they appeared in _Punch_--one a tourist struggling\r\nagainst the wind in a plaid; the other, two artists sketching with veils\r\non to escape the midges. Possibly they were the occasion of my attending\r\nthe Dinner. Leech, I think, asked me to do a drawing for 'Mokeanna' and\r\nthe drawing of the 'Children in the Studio.'\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time it is claimed that Miss Joanna Hill, the niece of Sir\r\nRowland Hill, contributed some sketches on the convict question; but it\r\nis certain that nothing in her name was ever accepted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LIBEL ON HIMSELF.\r\n\r\n(_By F. Barnard._)]\r\n\r\nA far more interesting and amusing adherent was Mr. Fred Barnard, a\r\nhumorist of the first rank; but as he was not yet seventeen years of age\r\nat the time it is not surprising that his drawings were greatly inferior\r\nto his admirable work of later years. His first joke was rejected, as he\r\nquaintly explains in the following note: \"In 1863 I was a student (and\r\nin consequence fondly supposed to be studying) at Heatherley's School of\r\nArt in Newman Street, and was then half-past sixteen. I must have had\r\nplenty of assurance at that time, for, unknown to anyone, I sent a joke,\r\naccompanied by a pencil sketch, to _Punch_. It represented a brute of a\r\ndustman belabouring his horse's head with the butt-end of his whip. To\r\nhim enters a fussy, benevolent-looking, and slightly sarcastic old\r\ngentleman, who remonstrates with him in these words: 'My good man,\r\n_that_ isn't the way to treat your horse! You should _poke it in his\r\neye_--poke it in his eye, man!' Mark Lemon returned it as, he said, 'the\r\nenclosed is rather too painful for _Punch_.' Encouraged by this repulse,\r\nI sent in another joke and drawing, which were accepted. A small parcel\r\narrived shortly afterwards containing a '_block_' of wood. As I had\r\nnever seen one before, and had no notion whatever as to the process of\r\nwood engraving, I didn't know what it was, or for what use. At the back,\r\non its rough ribbed surface, was a mystic inscription which I\r\ninterpreted into 'C. Bramitsi Struss,' but which a friend informed me\r\nwas intended for '6, Bouverie Street,' and he showed me how to set to\r\nwork. And so I did the drawing and some dozen others.... But I rather\r\nfancy I shine with more than usual brilliancy in religious\r\nperiodicals--especially when the articles I have to illustrate are\r\nwritten by imbecile women or ministers of the Gospel--I find it so\r\ncongenial and instructive.\" In three years Mr. Barnard was seen but\r\nfifteen times in all. Twenty years later, in 1884, he made a last\r\nappearance in a drawing which did not show him at his best (p. 303, Vol.\r\nLXXXIV.). This was entitled \"Early Prejudice,\" in which a child,\r\nreferring to the baby, suddenly exclaims, \"Oh, mamma! when baby begins\r\nto talk, what a dreadful thing if we find out _he's an Irishman_!\"--a\r\njoke, by the way, which in its main point was anticipated by Mr. du\r\nMaurier in 1876, in his drawing called \"Waiting for the Verdict.\" Lastly\r\nthere was a sketch called \"Evening at Earls,\" which was sent in and\r\nengraved, but not used; and since that day Mr. Barnard abstained from\r\nfurther contribution.\r\n\r\nIn this same year a young lady named Miss Mansel (now Mrs. Bull) sent in\r\na drawing of an incident which occurred at her uncle's place at Anglesey\r\nin Hampshire--the initials \"R. M.\" on the buckets being those of Colonel\r\nMansel. \"My eyes!\" says Cooper the groom, in effect, to a gentleman who\r\nhas watched a lady dismount from her over-ridden animal; \"to them ladies\r\na 'oss is a 'oss, and he must go!\" Leech slightly re-touched the\r\ndrawing, adding pigeons in the foreground, and so forth, but, of course,\r\ndid not add his initials. Curiously enough, this block was included\r\namong that artist's \"Pictures of Life and Character\" (p. 52, Series\r\nIV.). \"I remember I was very proud,\" writes the lady, \"a few days after\r\nthe drawing appeared, at hearing some officers in High Street,\r\nPortsmouth, quoting my sketch as a lady galloped up the road. I was only\r\nabout seventeen then.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R. T. PRITCHETT.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph by H. Bibo, Warwick._)]\r\n\r\nAfter a single contribution (entitled \"Clara\") by that ill-fated genius,\r\nGeorge Pinwell, Mr. R. T. Pritchett left his rifles for _Punch's_ pages.\r\nHe was in fact but a boy when he took charge of his father's gun factory\r\nat Enfield, and was still a lad when he conducted experiments in\r\ncompetition, with his own hand, for a new Government gun, introducing a\r\nbullet of his own conception, firing every shot, and triumphing over\r\nevery competitor. So the \"Enfield\" or \"Pritchett rifle\" brought him\r\nfame; but it proved the stumbling-block of his artistic career, for he\r\nfound out for himself the truth that a man known for one thing has\r\nlittle chance in any other field--particularly in the artistic field. He\r\nwas glad, however, when the Government eventually decided to manufacture\r\nthe gun themselves, and the House of Commons voted him £1,000--though\r\nthe experiments had cost nearly three times as much--and he was enabled\r\nto take to art.\r\n\r\nIt was at a meeting of the Moray Minstrels, the delightful \"Jermyn Band\"\r\npromoted by Mr. Arthur Lewis--where every man was invited on his own\r\nmerits and guests were excluded--that he met John Tenniel. John Forster\r\nwas the leader, and there were often present John Leech, Dickens,\r\nStanfield, Thackeray, Landseer, Tom Angell, Sir John Millais, Mr. Carl\r\nHaag, Mr. Frith, Mr. Marks, Charles Keene, Mr. Whistler, and Sir Arthur\r\nSullivan; altogether a notable company. It was under Sir John Tenniel's\r\nhospitable roof that Mr. Pritchett was initiated into the mysteries of\r\nwood-drawing. He had been watching the Master drawing his cartoon, and\r\nwas busy sketching the top of his amiable head, when its owner told him\r\nhe would be much better occupied in drawing on the wood, and threw him\r\nover a piece. Upon it Mr. Pritchett made a sketch, which Sir John took\r\nto Mr. Swain, and which afterwards appeared in one of A. K. H. B.'s\r\nworks. By Mr. Swain the draughtsman was introduced to \"Once a Week\" and\r\nto _Punch_, and for the latter Mr. Pritchett began with some initials.\r\nHis work appears from 1863 until 1869, some six-and-twenty amusing\r\ndrawings in all, and when he ceased in order to take to painting, he\r\ndrew for no other comic paper; for he had adopted the proud motto: \"Aut\r\n_Punch_, aut nullus.\" He then took to travel, writing books and\r\nillustrating them by himself, and commended himself still further by the\r\ncruise he made and illustrated with Lady Brassey in _The Sunbeam_.\r\nMoreover, he has for many years drawn privately for the Queen, in\r\nrecognition of which he received the Jubilee medal. A portrait of him,\r\ndrawn by Charles Keene, may be seen in the _Punch_ picture wherein a\r\nlittle girl asks her papa if she \"may have the gentleman's moustache for\r\na tail for her horse\"--a portrait so good that by virtue of it he made\r\nthe acquaintance of Mr. Sambourne years after, when the latter gentleman\r\naccosted him with the words \"I know you by Keene's likeness of you in\r\n_Punch_!\"\r\n\r\nThen came Fritz Eltze, who was introduced to _Punch_ on May 1st, 1864,\r\nand in due course took up some of the work let fall by Leech. He was a\r\nson of Sir Richard Mayne's confidential secretary, and most of what he\r\nknew of the life he drew was what he could see down Scotland Yard, or\r\nwhat he could remember of happy early days at Ramsgate. He was a\r\nconfirmed invalid who had never enjoyed life like other children, and\r\nthe consumption from which he died was already developing. He submitted\r\na few sketches to Mark Lemon who, according to his custom, sent Mr.\r\nSwain to make inquiries, with a result that was the brightest spot in\r\nthe artist's life. Although his work had the touch of the amateur about\r\nit, it had a curious charm; and rapid improvement followed. His humours\r\nof the fashions and follies of the day were greatly appreciated,\r\nespecially as his work advanced to half-page \"socials;\" but it was to\r\nhis tender touches that his popularity was chiefly due, particularly in\r\nhis treatment of child-life. The little one who--being told that they\r\nmay not have mistletoe in church at Christmas--naively asks if \"they\r\nmust not love one another in church,\" and the other who, when playing at\r\n\"horses\" and one of the leaders falls, cries to its companion next in\r\ncommand to \"sit on her head and cut the traces,\" are typical of his work\r\nin this direction. His last contribution (Mr. Punch _à la Turc_ on a\r\nminaret) appeared in September, 1870, but a couple of drawings, in 1872\r\nand 1875, were published \"out of stock.\" Eltze, one of _Punch's_ tall\r\nmen, by the way, was a pleasing draughtsman whose work, in its curious\r\nabsence of lining, had a striking appearance of originality in its\r\npractically broad outline.\r\n\r\nMr. A. R. Fairfield may be known by his sign-manual like a Sign of the\r\nZodiac run wild. It is, however, merely an inverted \"A\" on the Greek\r\ncharacter [Greek: Phi] with its stem elongated. He sprang from an\r\nartistic family, and after three months' training at South Kensington in\r\n1857, he began to draw on wood for \"Fun\" at about the same time as Mr.\r\nW. S. Gilbert--the autumn of 1861. His connection with _Punch_ was\r\nfortuitous. Being sent by Dr. James Macaulay, the editor of the \"Leisure\r\nHour,\" to Mr. Swain for some blocks on which to make his drawings for\r\nthat magazine, he was smartly captured by the vigilant engraver for the\r\n\"London Charivari.\" The result was many initials and drawings made to\r\nhis own jokes; but his first contributions appeared in the special\r\n\"Shakespeare Jubilee Number.\" His work appears often enough after\r\nthat--four-and-twenty times in 1864 and 1865. They were at times\r\namateurish in manner, but they had character and humour. It was Leech's\r\ndeath that practically put an end to Mr. Fairfield's connection with\r\n_Punch_, for Keene then came to reign supreme in the art department; but\r\nit did not matter much, as Mr. Fairfield, at that time a clerk at the\r\nBoard of Trade--in which capacity only he ever came into contact with\r\nTom Taylor, then Secretary of the Local Government Board--was given to\r\nunderstand that his career would be interfered with if he prosecuted\r\ntoo far his outside work. In 1887 (p. 245, Vol. XC.) another sketch\r\nappears, comet-like, after an interval of more than twenty years.\r\n\r\nColonel Seccombe followed a few weeks after Mr. Fairfield's début. At\r\nthat time he was a subaltern. His youthful military drawings--signed\r\nwith a sketch of a cannon--were clever, and highly promising. His cuts\r\nappeared in 1864, 1866, and again in 1882--eight altogether. Foreign\r\nservice interrupted the young draughtsman's artistic studies for a\r\nconsiderable period, but the result of his later labours is seen in the\r\nmany works for children and others which he has since published.\r\n\r\nAt the same time came a bevy of draughtsmen, who added little to\r\n_Punch's_ prestige--Dever, whose eight drawings are but caricatures,\r\nwhich none can see without being reminded of some of the grotesque types\r\nwhich later on were adopted by Mr. E. T. Reed in his earlier work; H. R.\r\nRobinson with two (though his work was not printed till two years\r\nlater); Chambers with one; and Rogat with three; and then the year 1865\r\nbrought two or three contributors of interest and importance.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was Fred Walker, A.R.A., whose first drawing, printed\r\nin the \"Almanac,\" shows a number of water-nymphs sea-bathing around\r\nNeptune--called \"The New Bathing Company (Limited). Specimens of the\r\nCostumes to be worn by the Shareholders\"--is graceful, and technically\r\ngood, but not particularly remarkable, and is rather fanciful than\r\nfunny. His second and last, \"Captain Jinks of the _Selfish_ and his\r\nFriends enjoying themselves on the River\"--a more masterly sketch--was\r\nmade in 1869 (p. 74, Vol. LVII.), in hot indignation at the selfishness\r\nand mischievousness of steam-launch skippers on the upper Thames. He had\r\nhimself been an angry witness of the destruction of the river-banks by\r\nprivate steamboats, but had fairly boiled over at the sight of the very\r\nincident which he recorded in _Punch_--the outrageous, insolent\r\nindifference shown by the trippers to all on the river or its banks,\r\nsave their own selfish selves. As a fisherman, Mr. Leslie, R.A., tells\r\nus, Walker looked upon the steam-launcher as his natural enemy; and it\r\nwas while the two friends were on the river together that the incident\r\noccurred, and the drawing was decided upon. \"He was most fastidious\r\nabout this work, rehearsing it many times before he was satisfied....\r\nIn rendering the distant landscape the work becomes entirely finished\r\nand tender. It is a beautiful little bit of Bray, with the church and\r\npoplars drawn direct from Nature; a bridge is introduced to prevent the\r\nscene being too easily recognised. On the opposite bank is a portrait of\r\nmyself, with easel and picture upset by the steamer's swell.... I was\r\ntold that three copies of _Punch_ were sent to the steam-launch\r\nproprietor on the day of publication.... This clever bit of satire had\r\nno effect.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. PRIESTMAN ATKINSON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN A HANSOM WITH MARK LEMON.\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by J. Priestman Atkinson._)]\r\n\r\n\"Dumb Crambo, Junior\"--Mr. J. Priestman Atkinson--is better remembered\r\nby _Punch_ readers, perhaps, by his pencil-name than by his common\r\ncipher. In 1864 he was in the General Manager's office at Derby,\r\npleasingly varying his clerical duties by drawing caricatures for the\r\namusement of his fellow-clerks, and designing cartoons for the local\r\nsatirical journal, the \"Derby Ram,\" which appeared spasmodically and\r\ndevoted itself principally to electioneering purposes. One of his\r\ncolleagues was Harry Lemon, Mark's son, who showed his father some of\r\nhis friend's sketches. On the occasion of a subsequent visit paid by Mr.\r\nAtkinson to town, Mark Lemon invited him to dine at the Garrick Club\r\n(whither they drove in a hansom, much in the style shown in the sketch),\r\nand Shirley Brooks drank to him as \"the future cartoonist of _Punch_.\"\r\nHis first cut--an initial T--appeared on p. 15, Vol. XLVIII, and\r\nthenceforward Mr. Atkinson has been considered on the \"outside Staff,\"\r\nwith but two breaks: the first during an absence in Paris for artistic\r\ninstruction, and the second from 1869 to 1876, when an opportunity\r\noccurred to make a \"sure fortune\" in commerce. The \"sure fortune,\" as\r\nusually befalls, became a pecuniary loss, and the draughtsman gladly\r\nwent back to the service of _Punch_ and the other papers and books to\r\nwhich his pencil (under a different signature) has been devoted. It is\r\nyears since Mr. Atkinson, who has latterly worked less for _Punch_ than\r\nin the early days of his connection, was able to do himself full justice\r\nin a half-page drawing; but his \"Dumb Crambo\" series remain among the\r\nhappy things which _Punch_ has published in the direction of punning\r\nsketches. They remind one of those by Hine, Newman, and the rest, in the\r\nold \"blackie\" days, and are often little masterpieces of comic\r\ningenuity--as may be seen in \"Shooting over an Extensive Moor,\" where a\r\nman is discharging his weapon over the portly figure of a Moorish\r\ngentleman. Mr. Atkinson, in addition, made some two score literary\r\ncontributions to the paper and \"Pocket-book\"--poems chiefly, and\r\nstories, not counting smaller trifles, between August, 1877, and the\r\naccession of Mr. Burnand to the Editorship. It was, I may add, at the\r\nsuggestion of Mr. Burnand that Mr. Atkinson adopted his _nom de crayon_,\r\njust as he suggested Mr. Furniss's \"Lika Joko.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES H. BENNETT.\r\n\r\n(_From the Water-Colour Drawing by Himself._)]\r\n\r\nOne of the brightest and most talented draughtsmen _Punch_ has ever had\r\nwas Charles H. Bennett, the forerunner of Mr. Linley Sambourne. He had\r\ngraduated in comic draughtsmanship, having been the life and soul of\r\n\"Diogenes\" (August, 1855), and rendered solid service to the \"Comic\r\nTimes\" (1855), and the \"Comic News\" (1863 to 1865), by which time his\r\ncipher of an owl, and then of a B in an owl's beak (\"B in it\" =\r\nBennett), were known and appreciated. Apart from his _Punch_ work, his\r\n\"Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress\" was his masterpiece in serious art; while\r\nin the opposite direction his \"Shadows\" (which procured him for a time\r\nthe public nickname of \"Shadow Bennett\"), as well as his amusing\r\n\"Studies in Darwinesque Development\" for Vizetelly's \"Illustrated\r\nTimes,\" and his second series, somewhat less satisfactory, of \"Shadow\r\nand Substance,\" obtained for him great popularity. But when he came on\r\n_Punch_, introduced to Mark Lemon by Hain Friswell, he was within two\r\nyears of his death. His début was on February 11th, 1865, with a sketch\r\nof \"Our Play Box,\" in which \"Mr. Punch's delight at finding his Dear Old\r\nPuppets where he left them in July\" shows that the artist had already\r\nbegun those illustrations to the \"Essence of Parliament\" which form the\r\nbackbone of his _Punch_ work. Occasional pictures there are,\r\nunconventional in shape, grotesque, ingenious, graceful in fancy, that\r\ndelight us while, as a rule, they successfully conceal any lack of early\r\nartistic education; but the Parliamentary drawings are those by which\r\nBennett will be best remembered. Between the date of his first sketch,\r\nwhen he was forthwith summoned to the Table without serving any\r\nprobationary period, to that last sketch in the spring of 1867, showing\r\nLord John Russell as a cock crowing upon the 1832 Easter egg (p. 116,\r\nVol. LII.), he had made over 230 drawings for the paper, besides his\r\ncontributions to the Pocket-books of 1866 and 1867. He had already\r\nestablished himself, despite repeated absences through ill-health, one\r\nof the greatest favourites in _Punch's_ company; and the comic letter\r\naddressed to him by his colleagues during one of his illnesses is\r\nprinted in the chapter on the \"_Punch_ Dinner.\" Indeed, he had not time\r\nto cut his cipher on the Table; the H is begun and abandoned. \"As for\r\ndear Bennett,\" Mr. Frederic Shields tells me, \"every link that attached\r\nme to him has so long since been severed, that to attempt to find the\r\nlost end of the thread is hopeless. Nothing remains but the sweet odour\r\nof his memory--like a faded rose-leaf turned up in a long-closed\r\ndrawer.\" But Mr. Sala declares that he had been, \"socially, the most\r\nmiserable of mankind. He was sober, industrious, and upright, and\r\nscarcely a Bohemian; but throughout his short life he was 'Murad the\r\nUnlucky.' At one time he occupied shabby chambers in the now defunct\r\nLyon's Inn, Strand; and it was the poor fellow's fate to have a child\r\nborn--a child that died--the sack from his employers, and the brokers\r\nin, _all in the same day_.\" Still, Bennett, who was one of the original\r\nfounders of the Savage Club, was cheerful enough, and of a singularly\r\nlovable disposition--as may almost be gathered from his pictures in\r\n_Punch_, in which the shadow of none of his former troubles is ever\r\nreflected: nothing but his \"facile execution and singular subtlety of\r\nfancy.\" Indeed, \"Cheerful Charley,\" as he was known to his intimates,\r\nbecame, as he himself declared, one of the luckiest and happiest of\r\nmen--fully appreciated for his art and his own delightful qualities by\r\ntroops of admiring friends. It was his extraordinary power of realising\r\nan abstract thought and crystallising it at once into a happy pictorial\r\nfancy that set him on a pedestal, a poet among his colleagues--those\r\ncolleagues who, when he died, lamented \"the loss of a comrade of\r\ninvaluable skill, and the death of one of the kindliest and gentlest of\r\nour associates, the power of whose hand was equalled by the goodness of\r\nhis heart.\"\r\n\r\nBut Bennett left his family in sad straits, and, on Shirley Brooks's\r\ninitiative, the \"_Punch_ men\" at once set about devising a means to help\r\nthem. The result was the theatrical performance referred to on pp.\r\n132-134. The Moray Minstrels wound up this famous entertainment, and\r\nShirley Brooks delivered a touching address of his own writing.\r\n\r\nBesides T. W. Woods (who made four drawings), Prehn (two), Lowe (six),\r\nand Hays (three), Mr. W. S. Gilbert swelled the list of contributors in\r\nthis same year (1865). His work, consisting of fifteen small cuts signed\r\nwith the now familiar \"Bab,\" and designed to illustrate the rhymes they\r\naccompany, was lost to _Punch_ by the indisposition for compromise\r\ndisplayed by contributor and Editor alike. \"I sent three or four\r\ndrawings,\" Mr. Gilbert informs me, \"and half-a dozen short articles; but\r\nI was told by Mark Lemon, or rather a message reached me from him, that\r\nhe would insert nothing more of mine unless I left 'Fun,' with which I\r\nwas connected. This I declined to do unless he would take me on the\r\nregular staff of _Punch_. This _he_ declined to do, and so the matter\r\nended. I had previously offered 'The Yarn of the Nancy Bell' (the first\r\nof the Bab Ballads) to _Punch_, but Mark Lemon declined it on the ground\r\nthat it was 'too cannibalistic for his readers.'\" So Mr. Gilbert knew\r\n_Punch_ no more; and it is commonly related that he enjoys nothing more\r\nthan an occasional good-humoured fling at the journal which could not\r\nsee his worth. \"I say, Burnand,\" he has many times been reported to have\r\nsaid at the Garrick Club and elsewhere, when the Editor had referred to\r\nthe heavy post-bag delivered each day at the office, though witticisms\r\nfound among the wilderness of suggestions were desperately few, \"do you\r\n_never_ get anything good?\" \"Oh, sometimes--occasionally.\" \"Then,\"\r\ndrawled the other, \"_why don't you ever put one of them in?_\"\r\n\r\n\"A Hot Chestnut\" (p. 143, Vol. XLIX.) was the first contribution of G.\r\nB. Goddard, well known a little later on as Bouverie Goddard, the\r\nanimal-painter. Oil-colour was in truth his medium; but his drawings\r\nwere good, and _Punch_ for a couple of years rejoiced in his new hunting\r\ndraughtsman. Goddard was a great friend of Charles Keene, with whom he\r\nshared for a time a studio in Baker Street; but feeling that he must\r\npaint pictures rather than draw upon the wood-block, he left the paper,\r\nafter placing to his credit fourteen drawings--of which some were\r\nadjudged to contain the best horses seen in its pages since the death of\r\nLeech.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important lady artist who ever worked for _Punch_ was\r\nMiss Georgina Bowers (for some years now Mrs. Bowers-Edwards).[63] It is\r\nnot usual, as I have remarked before, to find a woman a professional\r\nhumorist, though a colonial _Punch_ is edited by a lady; but it is, I\r\nbelieve, an undoubted fact, that up to this year of grace no female\r\ncaricaturist has yet appeared before man's vision. But Miss Bowers was a\r\nhumorist, with very clear and happy notions as to what fun should be,\r\nand how it should be transferred to a picture. Her long career began in\r\n1866, and thenceforward, working with undiminished energy, she executed\r\nhundreds of initials and vignettes as well as \"socials,\" devoting\r\nherself in chief part to hunting and flirting subjects. She was a facile\r\ndesigner, but her manner was chronically weak. It was John Leech who set\r\nher on the track; Mark Lemon, to whom she took her drawings, encouraged\r\nher, and with help from Mr. Swain she progressed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. BOWERS-EDWARDS.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph by S. A. Walker._)]\r\n\r\n\"My first published drawing,\" Miss Bowers tells me, \"was a dreadful\r\nthing of a girl urging a muff of a man to give her a lead at a brook. My\r\n'jokes' all came from incidents I saw out hunting, and from my own\r\nvaried adventures with horse and hound; but occasionally a suggestion\r\nsent to the Editor was transferred to me to be put into shape. Then some\r\none else wrote up to them. When I first hunted in Hertfordshire, I had\r\ngreat opportunities for provincial sporting studies. I feel now that\r\nsome of my subjects were too personal, and wonder how many people\r\nforgave me. I often overheard stories about myself in the hunting-field\r\n(where I had hard times with ladies occasionally). When Shirley Brooks\r\ndied, I felt I had lost my best and most helpful friend; and then Mr.\r\nTom Taylor cared nothing for sport or sporting subjects, so that I felt\r\nthat my work was uncongenial to him, and I got on badly and lost all\r\ninterest in it, and gave up, after having drawn ten years for the paper,\r\nto which I shall never again contribute.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Walter Crane, of all people in the world, appears on p. 33 of Vol.\r\nLI. The cut is hardly funny, except in idea--it represents a\r\nchignon-show--nor is it as well drawn as much of the work he was doing\r\nat the time; he had not yet hit upon the style or subject that he\r\nafterwards made his own. A couple of sketches by O. Harling, an amateur,\r\nconclude the list for the year.\r\n\r\nThe year 1867 is famous in _Punch's_ calendar for the acquisition of Mr.\r\nLinley Sambourne; but an earlier arrival was Mr. Frederic Shields. Mr.\r\nSwain suggested that he should \"do a letter or two\"; Mr. Shields did\r\nthree, including a \"social\" (\"Want your door swep', marm?\"), and a girl\r\ncurling her hair with the fender-tongs. The initials were kept over\r\nuntil 1870; and this constituted the sum of Mr. Shields' artistic\r\nadventure into the domain of humour.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[59] Mr. Henry James, jun., considers (\"Century Magazine,\" 1883) that\r\n\"since 1868, _Punch_ has been, artistically speaking, George du\r\nMaurier.\"\r\n\r\n[60] See \"Encyclopædia Britannica.\"\r\n\r\n[61] See \"Magazine of Art,\" 1891.\r\n\r\n[62] \"The Art of England: The Fireside,\" p. 174.\r\n\r\n[63] The other ladies are Miss Coode, Mrs. Romer (Mrs. Jopling-Rowe),\r\nMrs. Field, Miss Fraser, Miss Mansell (Mrs. Bull)--merely a sketch, and\r\nMiss Maud Sambourne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n_PUNCH'S_ ARTISTS: 1867-82.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Mr. Linley Sambourne--Mechanical Engineering Loses a Decorative\r\n     Designer--Mr. Sambourne's Work--His Photographs--And\r\n     Enterprise--Strasynski--Mr. Wilfrid Lawson--Mr. E.

Gilbert drily\r\nobserved, \"One Dutch of Sambourne makes the whole world grin!\" The jest\r\nwas wider in its application than he who made it, probably, had\r\nintended. The humour of the artist, his quaintness of fancy, wit, and\r\ntouch, are appreciated by whoever looks for something more, even in a\r\nprofessedly comic design, than that which is at first and immediately\r\nobvious. When, early in 1867, Mark Lemon fell into admiration of a\r\nlittle drawing that was luckily thrust into his hand, and declared that\r\nthe young draughtsman who wrought it had a great future before him, he\r\nproved himself possessed of a faculty of critical insight, or of an\r\neasy-going artistic conscience, uncommon even among editors. Few who saw\r\nMr. Linley Sambourne's early work, even throughout the first two or\r\nthree years of his practice, would have imagined that behind those\r\nwoodcuts, for all their cleverness, there lay power and even genius, or\r\nthat the man himself would soon come to be regarded as one of the\r\ngreatest masters of pure line of his time.\r\n\r\nAt that time Mr. Sambourne had been working in the engineering\r\ndraughtsmen's office of Messrs. Penn and Sons, of Greenwich. But the\r\nwork was not congenial; the \"pupil\" spent most of his time in sketching,\r\nand there is a story--doubtless as apocryphal as it is malicious--that\r\nin one of his designs for a steam-engine, he sacrificed so much to\r\n\"effect\" as to carry his steam-pipe through the spokes of the fly-wheel.\r\nIt was his office companion in misfortune, Mr. Alfred Reed, who secured\r\nhis friend's release from the thraldom of the iron-bound profession, by\r\nseizing the sketch already alluded to and showing it to his father,\r\nGerman Reed. By that gentleman it was submitted to his friend Mark\r\nLemon, who had about that time been writing an \"entertainment\" for the\r\ncompany at the \"Gallery of Illustrations.\" The result was an editorial\r\nsummons to the sketcher, and an engagement which has lasted to the\r\npresent day. Thus it was that, with a sketch of John Bright tilting at a\r\nquintain under the title of \"Pros and Cons,\" Mr. Sambourne found\r\nhimself, at the age of twenty-two, a regular contributor to\r\n_Punch_--though he had still to wait until 1871 before he was rewarded\r\nwith a seat at the Table.\r\n\r\nOf artistic education he had had practically none. In the engineering\r\ndrawing-office he had learned how to handle the pen and to put it to\r\nuses which have become a feature of his draughtsmanship. But besides a\r\nlife-school attendance extending over not more than a fortnight, he had\r\nno other teachers than his own eyes and his own intelligence. In his\r\nearliest work with the pencil there was a curious use of the point.\r\nSuddenly he was called upon, through the unexpected absence of Charles\r\nKeene from town, for more important work than that with which he had\r\nhitherto been entrusted. This was the half-page head-piece and the\r\ntail-piece to the preface to Vol. LIII. Then came promotion to the\r\n\"small socials\" and \"half-page socials.\" Some of the work he did fairly\r\nwell, founding himself now upon Leech, now upon Keene; but his character\r\nand originality were too powerful to follow any man. He began to form a\r\nstyle of his own, and that style did not lend itself to the\r\nrepresentation of modern life. It was suited better for decoration than\r\nfor movement; while the beauty of line and of silhouette which he sought\r\nand obtained, in spite of his intense, almost aggressive, individuality,\r\nplaced him absolutely apart from all the black-and-white artists of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIt was, I have said, to the example of his predecessor, Charles H.\r\nBennett, who died in April, 1867 (the very month in which Sambourne's\r\nfirst drawing appeared), that we owe those wonderful initial letters to\r\nthe \"Essence of Parliament\" of Shirley Brooks--those intricate drawings\r\nwhich, covering nearly a whole page, were such miracles of invention, of\r\nfancy, and of allusion, swarming with figures, overflowing with\r\nsuggestion, teeming with subtle symbolism. But these things did not come\r\nat once. It was not until the \"comic cut\" idea was put entirely on one\r\nside and his imagination allowed full play, that Mr. Sambourne fully\r\ndeveloped his powers--his strength of conception, design, and execution.\r\nAnd then it was that he revealed the fact that though a humorist--and\r\ninvariably, too, a good-humorist--by necessity, he is a classic by\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nThe artist's personality, as it should, impresses us first, powerfully\r\nand irresistibly. While under Mark Lemon, Mr. Sambourne, as an artist,\r\nwas still unformed. Under Shirley Brooks was awakened his wonderful\r\ninventive faculty. Under the _régime_ of masterly inactivity--the happy\r\npolicy of _laissez faire_--of Tom Taylor, the talent had burst forth\r\ninto luxuriance, not to say exuberance. And under Mr. Burnand it was\r\nschooled and restrained within severer limits.\r\n\r\nIt was many years before regular political cartooning[64] fell to his\r\nlot. He illustrated several of Mr. Burnand's serials in _Punch_, and\r\nsome of his work out of it. But afterwards he rose to the treatment of\r\nactuality. Upon the event of the hour his picture is formed, and each\r\nweek his work _must_ be forthcoming. There can be no question of\r\nfailure, no dallying with the subject, however elaborate or unpromising\r\nit may appear. A decision must be come to, and that rapidly; and there\r\nthe artist sits, his watch hung up before him, \"one eye on the dial and\r\nthe other on the drawing-paper,\" knowing that at the appointed hour the\r\nwork must be ready for the messenger. Thus the majority of his four\r\nthousand designs have been greatly hurried--hurried in thought as well\r\nas in execution. Many have been wrought in a single day; the great\r\nmajority within two days; very few, indeed, have taken more. But when he\r\nhas the time he wants, what amazing results are achieved! Sir John\r\nTenniel once exclaimed to me: \"What extraordinary improvement there is\r\nin Sambourne's work! Although a little hard and mechanical, it is of\r\nabsolutely inexhaustible ingenuity and firmness of touch. His diploma\r\nfor the Fisheries Exhibition almost gave me a headache to look at it--so\r\nfull, cram-full of suggestion, yet leaving nothing to the imagination,\r\nso perfectly and completely drawn, with a certainty of touch which\r\nbaffles me to understand how he does it.\"\r\n\r\nFor the rest, Mr. Sambourne's method, like his work, is unique. Keen of\r\nobservation though he is, his memory for detail is not to be compared to\r\nthat of Sir John Tenniel; and, actuated by that desire for accuracy\r\nwhich he holds desirable in a journal specially devoted to topical\r\nallusion, he avails himself extensively of the use of photography. In\r\nthe cabinets in his studio, filled full of drawers, each labelled\r\naccording to their contents, over ten thousand photographs are\r\nclassified: every celebrity of the day, and to a certain extent of the\r\npast, British and foreign, at various ages, in various costumes, and in\r\nvarious attitudes; representatives of the Church, the Bench, and the\r\nBar; of Science, Art, Literature, and the Stage; the beasts and birds\r\nand insects in and out of the Zoological Gardens; figures by the score,\r\nnude and draped; costumes of all ages and every country; soldiers,\r\nsailors, and the uniforms of every army and navy; land and sea and sky;\r\nboating and botany, nuns and clowns, hospital-nurses, musical\r\ninstruments, and rifles, locomotives, wheel-barrows, shop-windows, and\r\neverything else besides--everything, in short, as he himself declared,\r\n\"from a weasel to a Welshman\"--all are photographed mostly by himself,\r\nand all are arranged by himself, in readiness against the demand for\r\naccuracy and the exigencies of haste. But when time permits, Mr.\r\nSambourne goes to greater trouble still. Does he require a special\r\nuniform? he begs the War Office--not unsuccessfully--to lend him one or\r\ntwo men, or even a detachment; does he want to represent Mr.\r\nGladstone--say, as Wellington (as he did November 2nd, 1889)? he\r\nprocures the loan of the duke's own raiment, and only stops short at\r\nborrowing Mr. Gladstone himself. For his types, too, he takes pains not\r\nless thorough. For Britannia's helmet, he made working drawings of the\r\nunique Greek piece in the British Museum, and from that had a replica\r\nconstructed--one of the most notable items in a notable \"property\" room.\r\n\r\nAt the back of his house is a paved courtyard, wherein his servant poses\r\nas every character under the sun while he is photographed by his master,\r\nwho then runs inside to develop the plate and make a dash at his\r\ndrawing. Or he will photograph himself, or the model in the desired\r\nattitude; or he will get his friends to pose. Among his sitters there is\r\nnone more useful than the burly man who serves equally well for\r\n\"Policeman A 1\" or John Bull, for the Duke of Cambridge or Prince\r\nBismarck. It was he who sat for one of the finest of Mr. Sambourne's\r\n\"junior cartoons\" on the occasion when the great ex-Chancellor had said:\r\n\"I am like the traveller lost in the snow, who begins to get stiff while\r\nthe snow-flakes cover him.\" This picture of the aged and forlorn\r\nstatesman, accompanied only by his faithful hound, is perhaps the best\r\nof the artist's achievements of dignity and pathos--worthy of being\r\nnamed with \"Dropping the Pilot\" of Sir John Tenniel. His passion for\r\nrealism is so great that, I remember, when he was engaged on his\r\n\"Mahogany Tree\" for the Jubilee number of _Punch_--one of the most\r\npopular drawings he ever made--he had just such a table duly laid for\r\ndinner in the courtyard, with one person sitting at it in order to show\r\nthe proportion, and photographed it from a window of the house at the\r\nnecessary elevation.[65] But for his love of accuracy he would not have\r\ndone these things; nor, but for his love of naturalism, could he have\r\ngiven us his numerous fine studies of Nature. And but for this, Mr.\r\nPunch would never have printed one or two of his Norwegian sketches,\r\nsuch as \"The Church-going Bell,\" in which there was not the slightest\r\nattempt at humour or fun--nothing but a calm and reposeful love of\r\nNature, the deep, sad impression on the mind and heart of the artist as\r\nhe watches the northern sun dip in sleepy majesty behind the panting\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nLike Rabelais, he can use the pencil to greater ends under cover of the\r\nmotley, and encase bitter truths with the gilt of a printed jest. Like\r\nGiotto and his legendary feat, he can draw you a perfect circle with his\r\npen--and perhaps he is the only man in the country who can do it. His is\r\nthe rare gift that in him sense of fun, of dignity, and of art is equal.\r\nHe will brook nothing more serious in his sallies than chaff and banter;\r\nand yet his kindly art, based upon Nature and observation of the work of\r\nothers, has, by its very truth, made him enemies even on foreign\r\nthrones. Nevertheless, it is less as a politician and a satirist that he\r\nclaims recognition; it is primarily as an artist that he will assuredly\r\nbe remembered when his place among his countrymen has to be determined.\r\n\r\nA Polish artist, with Mr. Sambourne's initials, L. Strasynski by name,\r\nalso began in 1867, and during that and the following year contributed\r\nnine cuts, very foreign in feeling and firm in touch. Then, after an\r\nanonymous draughtsman, \"M.S.R.,\" had appeared with a single cut\r\n(\"Candles\"), Mr. F. Wilfrid Lawson, the elder brother and teacher of\r\nCecil Lawson, contributed a sheetful of initials and vignettes which\r\ndribbled forth in the paper up to 1876; and Mr. T. Walters, a\r\nhalf-a-dozen, up to 1875. Mr. E. J. Ellis, now better known in other\r\nfields than comic draughtsmanship, began on December 12th, 1867. He had\r\nreceived an introduction to Mark Lemon through Mr. (now Sir) Algernon\r\nBorthwick, and found the Editor \"good-natured enough,\" as he himself\r\nsays, \"to allow me to do a dozen or so of initials, and a quarter-page\r\nillustration. They were all more or less pinched and painful things, and\r\nMr. Lemon did not conceal from me that 'he was not knocked over by\r\nthem.' But they were drawn on the block--not on paper--and from the\r\nstrangeness and discomfort of it came the tight-elbowed style of the\r\nwork. Of what I did altogether, only about a third were printed; half\r\nwere paid for; but what they paid for they did not print, and what they\r\nprinted they did not pay for.\" At that time Mr. Ellis caught the fever\r\nof decorative art, classic and romantic, which culminated in the\r\n\"interpreted\" edition of Blake's \"Prophetic Books,\" in collaboration\r\nwith Mr. Yeats; and _Punch_ lost a promising recruit.\r\n\r\nThe experience of Mr. Ernest Griset, who is first seen on p. 61 of Vol.\r\nLIV., was more extensive but less gratifying. He excelled at comic\r\nanimals--his human figures are most of them of one ragged type--but on\r\nBennett's sudden disappearance he was quickly encouraged to take up the\r\ndead man's work, and was enabled to show in many of his three-and-sixty\r\ndrawings of that year the full range of his talent, his remarkable\r\ninvention and ingenuity. Mr. Griset, though born in Boulogne, was\r\neducated in England, and after studying art under Gallait, intended to\r\nfollow water-colour painting, taking subjects by preference of a Glacial\r\nPrehistoric kind. But the foundation of \"Fun\" gave him the opportunity\r\nof comic draughtsmanship, and the work he did for the paper brought him\r\nMark Lemon's invitation to call upon him. A cordial reception and a\r\nflattering tribute to his ability were followed by an understanding of\r\nregular employment, and the young draughtsman became a _Punch_ artist\r\nunattached. But he did not remain long in favour. His work, perhaps, was\r\nnot highly popular, and Mark Lemon perceptibly cooled towards him. So,\r\nfinding he was no longer wanted, Mr. Griset, who was then no more than\r\ntwenty-four years of age, retired, and consoled himself in other\r\ndirections--notably by illustrating \"Æsop's Fables,\" which had attracted\r\nBennett and Sir John Tenniel before him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ERNEST GRISET.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph by W. G. Parker and Co._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. ERNEST GRISET OBEYS THE EDITOR'S SUMMONS.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the index to Vol. LIII. is a little tail-piece that marks\r\nthe advent of Mr. A. Chasemore. This draughtsman was welcomed by Mark\r\nLemon with the words: \"You may try your hand at a large drawing, but let\r\nit be broad fun. We don't want any more ladies and pretty children.\"\r\nThat was in 1868--yet ladies and pretty children do not even now seem\r\nto have lost their popularity! The original drawing was not a success,\r\nand had to be touched up by Keene. It is mentioned here as affording\r\nanother good example of the careful way in which sketches are adapted.\r\nThe subject was a recruit joining a volunteer corps. The adjutant\r\ninquires: \"What company would you wish to be in?\" to which the recruit\r\nreplies: \"Oh, gentleman's co'pany, of course!\" The recruit was left\r\nuntouched, but the adjutant was re-drawn by Keene. \"I'm afraid there's\r\nnot much humour in the idea,\" wrote the artist with quaint modesty;\r\n\"still, I hope it's good enough for _Punch_!\" Up to 1875 Mr. Chasemore\r\ncontributed thirty-three drawings, and in addition there was a belated\r\none in 1879; and then he passed over to \"Judy,\" to which paper he\r\nthereafter devoted himself.\r\n\r\nThe last recruit of the year was \"Phiz'\" young son, Walter Browne, who,\r\nthrough his father's influence with Mark Lemon, was allowed to\r\ncontribute a few drawings, the first of which appeared on p. 148, Vol.\r\nLV., and the last on November 20th, 1875. He was hardly out of his\r\nstudentship at the time--he was a pupil of Bonnat--and his work was\r\n\"young;\" but he might have risen on _Punch_ had he not allowed himself\r\nto be tempted away by a delusive offer of Tom Hood's of constant work on\r\n\"Fun,\" so that he closed the door in his own face, and had thenceforward\r\nto look to news-drawing and book-illustration for advancement.\r\n\r\nMr. Briton Riviere, R.A., appeared in the month of January, 1868. Few\r\nwho have followed his career as painter would detect in him the\r\ninveterate humorist; yet it was in that direction that his bent led him\r\nwhile he was still a boy. When at Oxford he had amused himself of an\r\nevening with making humorous illustrations in pen-and-ink, and a book\r\nwhich he then so drew was shown by him in 1868 to his friend Mr. G. L.\r\nCraik, one of the partners in the house of Macmillans, and the husband\r\nof John Halifax, Gentlewoman. This book Mrs. Craik sent to Mark Lemon,\r\nwho invited the young graduate to the _Punch_ office, and adopting the\r\ngrotesque illustrations to \"Mazeppa\" at once, gave him a sort of running\r\ncommission to do incidental work, to which Mr. Riviere gladly responded\r\nby a total of the twenty-three cuts--chiefly of wild animal\r\nsubjects--contributed by him through 1868 and 1869. Not only was the\r\nwork congenial, but the artist at the time was entirely dependent upon\r\nillustration for his livelihood, for he was newly-married, and the\r\npicture-buying public had not yet been educated up to purchasing his\r\ncanvases. His illustrations--in chief part for American\r\npublications--were all done at night, as his days were delivered over to\r\nearnest though unremunerative painting. But directly his pictures began\r\nto make way, he dropped illustration, which had made inroads upon his\r\nhealth and had permanently injured his left eye through the strain of\r\nthe artificial light. So Mr. Riviere ceased his _Punch_ connection, the\r\nproprietors, moreover, consenting to suppress those blocks which had not\r\nyet appeared, as the painter feared that they would do harm to himself\r\nprofessionally, and no particular good to the paper. Yet he has always\r\nexpressed his pride that he should have been one of the outside \"_Punch_\r\nStaff,\" and he has proved it by elaborating the initial \"M,\" which was\r\npublished on p. 217, Vol. LVI., in \"_Punch's_ Derby Sporting Prophecy,\"\r\ninto his picture \"Of a Fool and His Folly there is no End,\" which was\r\npainted and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1890.\r\n\r\nA couple of drawings from Mr. Cooper, and an initial by \"W. V.\" (the\r\ncipher of Mr. Wallis Mackay, whose sketch and subsequent work did not\r\nappear for a couple of years) were next sent in, and then came Mr. J.\r\nMoyr Smith, whose long series of clever mock-Etruscan drawings continued\r\nwith few breaks for the space of ten years. Although the spirit that\r\nruns through them becomes monotonous after a while, the draughtsmanship\r\nand the excellence of the fooling always elicit admiration. Mr. Smith\r\nhad served his time to architecture; but natural love of figure-drawing,\r\nintensified by the study of Sir John Tenniel's comic illustrations of\r\nthe historical costume, faithfully and even learnedly delineated and\r\nperfectly drawn, settled his career, and \"Fun,\" under Tom Hood's\r\neditorship, witnessed his start in humorous life. Referred to Mark Lemon\r\nby \"Pater\" Evans, he obtained a ready hearing, and for a couple of\r\nyears drew for the paper; but he did not work regularly, during an\r\ninterval of three years, until 1872. From this time forward he was one\r\nof _Punch's_ recognised outside contributors, though he worked for it\r\nonly when not engaged in making designs for art-manufacturers. It was\r\nunder Shirley Brooks's editorship, and later under Tom Taylor's, that he\r\ngave full rein to his passion for classic treatment, and his ornament,\r\nwhich gave a distinct _cachet_ to _Punch_ up to 1878, was not founded on\r\na mere grotesque treatment of classical subjects, but was the fruit of a\r\nclose study of and easy familiarity with heathen mythology, classical,\r\nEgyptian, and, in particular, Norse. The fun was not particularly broad,\r\nbut Tom Taylor was especially tickled by his attempts to find amusement\r\nin the extraordinary head-dresses worn by ladies of Ancient Egypt--such\r\nas that in the cut (July 11th, 1874) learnedly inscribed \"Oos Yer\r\nAtter?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. MOYR SMITH.\r\n\r\n(_From a Drawing by Himself._)]\r\n\r\nMrs. Jopling-Rowe, then Mrs. Frank Romer, was the only new arrival in\r\nthe year 1869. The death of her husband had left her under the necessity\r\nof supporting herself and her children, and as niece of Mark Lemon she\r\nmight have obtained easy admittance to _Punch_, had she not found\r\nportrait-painting a more remunerative occupation. Under the initial of\r\nher name she made but four drawings of little importance, the most\r\nambitious being an illustration of the \"Song of Sixpence,\" which was\r\ntreated as a subject from \"Nursery History.\" It appeared on page 56 of\r\nVolume LVII.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallis Mackay, the clever \"Captious Critic\" of later days, followed\r\n\"W. G.\"--a contributor of a couple of trifles--and worked for _Punch_\r\nfrom 1870 to 1874, making seven-and-twenty drawings, \"socials\" chiefly,\r\nin his well-known style. It was in the latter year that Tom Taylor\r\nsucceeded to the editorship, and having been mortally offended with a\r\npersonal sketch which the \"Captious Critic\" had drawn some time before,\r\nhe forthwith cancelled the connection. Even the blocks already in hand\r\nand paid for were suppressed, with the exception of four, of which the\r\nlast appeared in 1877. On the accession of Mr. Burnand, says Mr. Mackay,\r\nhe was informed that Bouverie Street was no longer \"a close borough,\"\r\nand that the Essence of Parliament awaited him; but the \"Special\r\nCorrespondent\" was away in the wilds of Ireland, and the opportunity\r\npassed by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. SANDS.\r\n\r\n(_From a Painting._)]\r\n\r\nThe same day as that on which the first of Mr. Bennitt's four drawings\r\narrived--(he must not be confounded with the Colonel Bennitt who is\r\nreferred to later on)--saw also the first contribution of Mr. J. Sands,\r\nCharles Keene's friend, who put his little anagrammatic device of an\r\nhour-glass to more than three-score drawings between the years 1870 and\r\n1880. Save for their ingenuity, they were not of first-rate importance.\r\nMr. Sands had been an Edinburgh and Arbroath solicitor; a prairie\r\nfarmer; an art-student under Charles Keene, who made him practise\r\ndrawing until he became dyspeptic and melancholy at the sight of his own\r\nfeeble work; an emigrant to Buenos Ayres, where he practised most trades\r\nin turn, including that of newspaper artist; a contributor and\r\ndraughtsman (again under Keene's eye) to London magazines, and to\r\n_Punch_; a sojourner in the almost inaccessible island of St. Kilda; an\r\narchæological explorer in the islands of the Hebrides; and finally, for\r\nthirteen years a hermit, living a hermit's life, solitary and\r\nintellectual, at the water's edge, at Walls, Shetland. Many have been\r\nthe stones that have rolled for _Punch_, but few that have rolled so\r\nfar, or gathered so much moss the while. In his more civilised moments,\r\nso to speak, Mr. Sands lived for a time a good deal in the life of\r\nKeene, to whom he presented many jokes and sketches for pictures; but he\r\nbecame disheartened at the slowness of his own promotion, and\r\nsuspecting, moreover, that Keene, in his heart, would have been glad\r\nwere he to retire in favour of Mr. A. Corbould, Keene's nephew, he\r\nfinally decided to withdraw. Nevertheless, the friendship of the two men\r\nlasted to the end--a friendship that was a rare and deep attachment.\r\n\r\nTwo more names belong to 1870--that of Mr. E. F. Brewtnall, R.W.S.,\r\nwhose single contribution was sent in in this year; and Mr. W. Ralston,\r\nof Glasgow, later a photographer by profession, but by taste and\r\nopportunity an artist. It was with Shirley Brooks's succession to the\r\nEditorship that Mr. Ralston obtained his recognition. \"I remember,\" says\r\nthe draughtsman, \"how in walking down to business that day I tried to\r\nlook unconscious of my greatness, and mentally determined that it would\r\nmake no difference in my bearing.\" His drawings at first were very hard,\r\nbut the point of humour was invariably good, and the Scottish \"wut\"\r\nequal to that of the best man who ever drew for the paper. He was a\r\nself-taught draughtsman, who learned by watching his younger brother,\r\n\"whose artistic boots,\" says he, \"I was not fit to black;\" but he\r\nimproved rapidly, and contributed in all two hundred and twenty-seven\r\ndrawings, initials, and \"socials.\" At the death of Tom Taylor, Mr.\r\nRalston's contributions ceased, only one more from his pencil ever\r\nappearing in the paper--in 1886. It was partly because Mr. Ralston\r\nbecame a busy \"Graphic\" artist, and partly because the Editor was in\r\nsearch of new blood; but the only time Mr. Ralston made his\r\npost-Taylorian appearance in _Punch_ (that was not \"old stock\") was with\r\nan article in the Sandford and Merton style, directed against the Duke\r\nof Bedford and the Bloomsbury gates. This little attack, called\r\n\"K.G.--Q.E.D.,\" constitutes Mr. Ralston's sole contribution to the\r\nliterature of the age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. RALSTON.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph by W. Ralston, Glasgow._)]\r\n\r\nMr. A. Chantrey Corbould, as already explained, was introduced to\r\n_Punch_ by his uncle, Charles Keene. Beginning in 1871, he worked on\r\nuntil 1890, when a temporary cessation intervened. His work, dealing\r\nchiefly with hunting and \"horsey\" subjects, has always a certain\r\nfreshness, in spite of being, technically speaking, a little tight, and\r\nat one time raised their author to very near the front rank in\r\npopularity. He was only eighteen when he joined (the expression \"Mr.\r\nPunch's young men,\" it will be seen, is no misnomer), having already had\r\nthe benefit of Keene's advice. One of the elder artist's letters is\r\nbefore me as I write:--\r\n\r\n     \"I saw your drawing this morning,\" he says, \"and think it very\r\n     good, considering the short time you have had to study art; but I\r\n     can see that the execution would render the drawing rather\r\n     difficult to engrave, and you want a little more study and practice\r\n     in 'the human face divine' to please the newspaper people. I never\r\n     give advice on these matters, but I can tell you from my own\r\n     experience I don't think drawing on wood is a good road to stand on\r\n     as an artist; but if you don't agree with me, and wish to go in for\r\n     this particular branch, it seems to me that you should article or\r\n     apprentice yourself by legal agreement with some engraver of large\r\n     business for a certain time on certain terms. This is how I began,\r\n     and have been sorry for it ever since!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. CHANTREY CORBOULD.\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by Himself._)]\r\n\r\nFourteen years later, when Mr. Corbould was still hoping for that\r\nposition with which many people already credited him--a Staff\r\nappointment--Keene wrote:--\r\n\r\n     \"I've no doubt myself that it is in your power, if you manage well,\r\n     to get on to _Punch_. It is rather unlucky that Burnand is not a\r\n     sporting man\" [Mr. Burnand, by the way, is an inveterate horseman].\r\n     \"... I should advise you to drive gently but steadily at hunting\r\n     and country subjects, and if you get a good idea of any sort have a\r\n     shy at it, and encourage your friends to look out for you....\r\n     You've noticed I only do one a week now, as a rule. I send you an\r\n     idea you might work out. Wouldn't you make it a meet (in\r\n     background), and the speakers mounted?\r\n\r\n     \"'Think I must part with him.' SHE: 'What! all at once, wholesale?\r\n     Wouldn't it be better to sell him retail on little skewers?' I'll\r\n     look out and send you anything in your line I hear of.\"\r\n\r\nThis joke of Keene's was duly worked out by Mr. Corbould, and was\r\nproduced Nov. 22, 1884 (p. 249, Vol. LXXXVII). Up to this time the\r\ndraughtsman had worked under three Editors, to whom, as was the\r\npractice, he would send in slight sketches to \"legends,\" and work out\r\nthose which were accepted, the selection being made in due course, with\r\na bit of criticism to take the vanity out of him, thus: \"_Very good\r\nsubject._ The man is far too big for the horse, which is a 15.3 if he's\r\nan inch. This was generally Leech's mistake; so you err in remarkably\r\ngood company. Why 'Hunting Puzzle'? It's not a puzzle.\"\r\n\r\nApart from a couple of sketches by Mrs. Field and one by Mr. Graham, the\r\nyear 1872 brought no contributor but Randolph Caldecott. The\r\nhalf-a-dozen sketches together comprising his \"Seaside Drama\" (p. 120,\r\nVol. LXI.) contains no hint of that peculiar style, individual humour,\r\nand perfect suggestion, which he was to make his own. His drawings were\r\npublished in 1872, 1873, and 1875, and then again in 1879, 1880, 1882,\r\nand 1883--eighteen drawings in all; but it was not until 1879 that\r\nCaldecott showed any of his later freshness and humorous exaggeration.\r\nIt was in 1870, his biographer asserts, that his drawings were shown to\r\nShirley Brooks and Mark Lemon:--\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Clough thus records the incident: Bearing an introductory\r\n     letter, he went up to London on a flying visit, carrying with him a\r\n     sketch on wood and a small book of drawings of 'The Fancies of a\r\n     Wedding.' He was well received. The sketch was accepted, and with\r\n     many compliments the book of drawings was detained. 'From that day\r\n     to this,' said Mr. Caldecott, 'I have not seen either sketch or\r\n     book.' Some time after, on meeting Mark Lemon, the incident was\r\n     recalled, when the burly, jovial Editor replied, 'My dear fellow, I\r\n     am vagabondising to-day, not _Punching_.' I don't think Mr.\r\n     Caldecott rightly appreciated the joke.\"[66]\r\n\r\nCaldecott had had some practice in humorous drawing, having drawn three\r\nyears before for the \"Will-o'-the-Wisp\" and \"The Sphinx.\" But his\r\n_Punch_ work was merely occasional; his more serious labours were for\r\nthe \"Graphic,\" \"The Pictorial World,\" and most notably, on Mr. Edmund\r\nEvans's suggestion, for the immortal children's books which the engraver\r\nmight print in colours. He was only forty years old when he died, and\r\n_Punch_, in the course of a long obituary poem, bore witness to his\r\nsingular charm, though he made no reference to the work contributed to\r\nhis own pages:--\r\n\r\n  \"Sure never pencil steeped in mirth\r\n    So closely kept to grace and beauty.\r\n  The honest charms of mother Earth,\r\n    Of manly love, and simple duty,\r\n  Blend in his work with boyish health,\r\n    With amorous maiden's meek cajolery,\r\n  Child-witchery, and a wondrous wealth\r\n    Of dainty whim and daring drollery.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best military contributor of jokes that _Punch_ has had is\r\nMajor-General H. G. Robley. Keene, as I have already stated, re-drew or\r\ntouched up the earlier of his sketches, which dealt for the most part\r\nwith military life on foreign service. Twenty-seven contributions, many\r\nof them unsigned and of varying degrees of importance, came from young\r\nCaptain Robley, as he was then, of the 91st (Argyle and Sutherland)\r\nHighlanders. To Keene he was, as the artist confessed, \"a very obliging\r\ncorrespondent,\" who sketched well and sent him many suggestions. \"You\r\nsee, a mess-table makes a very 'preserve' for _Punch_ subjects. I don't\r\nfollow his drawings very much, but they are very useful in military\r\nsubjects.\" Captain Robley contributed during the years 1873-8. Mr. W. J.\r\nHennessy, who has since established his position as a delicate and\r\naccomplished draughtsman, made a couple of drawings of social subjects\r\nin 1873, and two more in 1875, but they were by no means of the\r\nexcellence to which the artist afterwards attained.\r\n\r\nNo fresh contributor appears in 1874, the couple of sketches signed \"C.\r\nB.\" having been sent in twelve months before, and that of F. Woods\r\nhaving been practically redrawn, although his initials were allowed to\r\nstand; but 1875 witnessed the work of five new hands in the paper. The\r\nfirst was Robert Bruce Wallace, whose style was modelled on that of C.\r\nH. Bennett, and greatly inspired besides by Mr. Sambourne. The bulk of\r\nhis work was done from 1875 to 1878 inclusive, but in the latter year he\r\nfell away, and his contributions became very rare. He died in 1893, and\r\none of his drawings made a posthumous appearance in 1894. He was a very\r\nprolific contributor. Wallace gave up his _Punch_ connection--not, as\r\nhas been said, because the remuneration was insufficient, but because he\r\nconsidered himself ill-treated. According to him, he had fully\r\nunderstood that he was to succeed Miss Georgina Bowers, and with this\r\npromotion in view, he had proceeded to Worcestershire from Manchester,\r\nwhere he lived, and made preparatory studies of horse and hound and\r\nlandscape scenery. When, contrary to expectation, he found himself\r\npassed by, he was grievously disappointed and annoyed, and refused to go\r\non with initials and so forth--which he drew with so much beauty and\r\nconscientiousness. He was a secretary of the Manchester Academy of Fine\r\nArts, and had a considerable reputation as a wit at its councils; and\r\nwhen Ford Madox Brown was engaged on his Manchester frescoes, Wallace\r\nacted for some time as his assistant.\r\n\r\nThen followed Colonel Ward Bennitt, late of the 5th Lancers, who drew\r\nseveral initials and \"socials;\" but being at that time a lieutenant (in\r\nthe 6th Inniskilling Dragoons), he found that he had no time during the\r\nday to draw for _Punch_, and that night work affected his eyesight. Mr.\r\nJ. Curren, with a couple of sketches, in 1875 and 1876; Mr. L. G.\r\nFawkes, of the Royal Hibernian Academy, with a single drawing in the\r\nformer year; and that clever young painter, Valentine Bromley, who died\r\nso young after promising so well, with a single drawing, complete the\r\nlist; but there was nothing distinctive in the work of any save the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. BLATCHFORD.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph by Warwick Brooks._)]\r\n\r\nMr. Montagu Blatchford, who adopted--not without success--the\r\nBennett-Sambourne-Wallace style of half-decorative, half-pictorial\r\nrepresentation, appeared towards the end of 1876; and although he was\r\nsupplanted a few years later by Mr. Harry Furniss and Mr. Wheeler, he\r\ncontinued, even after 1881, to be seen fitfully in _Punch_. He was, by\r\nprofession, a carpet-designer, with unusual skill in freehand drawing;\r\nand when in the spring of 1876 he no longer saw Mr. Sambourne's work in\r\nthe paper, he adopted the shrewd idea of sending in some sketches in\r\nwhich that artist's style was respectfully imitated. But Tom Taylor was\r\nshrewder still, and wrote: \"Dear Sir,--Mr. Sambourne's absence is only\r\ntemporary. I have not, therefore, an opening for a designer to fill his\r\nplace, and return your drawings, which are very clever;\" adding that he\r\nwould be glad to give the young applicant an opening if possible--a\r\nchance which soon came, but which never meant very much for the artist.\r\nHe began with a comic umbrella-stand, and from that basis made scores of\r\nsmall subjects, all, with but half-a-dozen exceptions, of his own\r\nsuggestion. Then, when Tom Taylor died he sent less and less--a little\r\nsore that he should be pushed aside for younger men--and finally ceased\r\naltogether, returning to Halifax in response to business calls. Then\r\nfollowed W. J. Hodgson (who is not to be confounded with the draughtsman\r\nof the same name and initials of nearly twenty years later), with four\r\ncuts, during 1876 and the two next years; \"Captain F.,\" with a couple;\r\nMiss Fraser (\"MF\"), daughter of Colonel Fraser of the City Police, with\r\nseven sketches; and Mr. Hallward, with a couple of initials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E. J. WHEELER.\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by Himself._)]\r\n\r\nFor four years no accession of importance was made, Mr. W. G. Smith,\r\nwith a single initial, and Mr. W. G. Holt, with three more ambitious\r\ncuts, being all that 1878 had to show; while 1879 brought forth Mr.\r\nDower Wilson with a \"social\" in the Almanac, and a nameless F. B.\r\n(\"Memorials\"). In the following year Mr. Athelstan Rusden made his\r\nmaiden appearance as an illustrator with a Disraeli Elephant, which he\r\nhad drawn on the wood and sent in from Manchester; but \"Moonshine\"\r\noffered the inducement of continuous occupation, and the young amateur\r\ndrifted away.\r\n\r\nThe year 1880 is memorable for the enlistment of Mr. Harry Furniss. Mr.\r\nE. J. Wheeler was the other arrival, and he still (1895) spreads over\r\n_Punch's_ pages his bright little theatrical sketches and initials, as\r\nwell as illustrations to Mr. Burnand's own literary contributions. His\r\ndrawings are unmistakable, as much by their rather old-fashioned method\r\nas by the well-known monogram of later years, or by the appropriate\r\nsign-manual of a \"four-Wheeler\" in his earlier contributions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARRY FURNISS.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph by Debenham and Gould._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BISHOP PUNCH.\r\n\r\n(_By Harry Furniss._)]\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Harry Furniss _Punch_ found an artist who was destined to become,\r\nduring the fourteen years of his connection, a considerable factor in\r\nhis career. Mr. Furniss was bred up in the _Punch_ tradition. While\r\nstill a boy at school in Ireland--where, through a mistake on Time's\r\npart, he was born, of English and Scotch parents--he produced, edited,\r\nand illustrated \"The Schoolboys' Punch\" in manuscript, in careful\r\nimitation of the original, drawing the cartoon as well. One of these\r\n\"big cuts\" represented himself as the performer in a cabinet-trick--(the\r\nsensation of the Davenport Brothers was before the public at the\r\ntime)--in which the cabinet was the school, and the ropes that bound him\r\nthe curriculum; while from another cabinet he emerges in full blaze of\r\nscholastic triumph. He soon began drawing, and engraving his own\r\ndesigns, for Mr. A. M. Sullivan's Irish version of _Punch_; and having\r\nmet Tom Taylor--who then reigned in Whitefriars--and been by him\r\napplauded for his sketches, he accepted the hint that he might send in\r\ndrawings to the original Hunchback of Fleet Street. But when they came,\r\nTaylor declined them on the ground that the ideas were unsuitable; yet,\r\ncuriously enough, they several times appeared, re-drawn by members of\r\nthe Staff. One of these, re-drawn by Mr. du Maurier in February, 1877,\r\nrepresented a scene witnessed by Mr. Furniss from the railway--a flooded\r\nfield navigated by two men in a boat, who are reading a notice-board\r\nindicating that the submerged \"highly-eligible site\" was \"To be Let or\r\nSold for Building.\" Mr. Furniss thereupon decided to have done with\r\n_Punch_ during that editorship; and came to London to seek his artistic\r\nfortune. He speedily made such way on leading journals, especially on\r\nthe \"Illustrated London News,\" that Mr. Burnand, on succeeding to his\r\noffice, invited the young draughtsman, then aged twenty-six, to become a\r\nregular contributor. Mr. Furniss's first sketch (published on p. 204,\r\nVol. LXXIX., 1880) was a skit on what is ignorantly called the Temple\r\nBar Griffin--(it is really an heraldic dragon, designed by Horace\r\nJones)--executed by his friend C. B. Birch, A.R.A.\r\n\r\nAt that time Mr. Henry W. Lucy had just been summoned to reinforce\r\n_Punch's_ Staff, and to take over the \"Essence of Parliament,\" since\r\nShirley Brooks's death so ponderously distilled by the late Tom Taylor,\r\nand to him was left the selection of an illustrator of his \"Toby's\r\nDiaries.\" In selecting Mr. Furniss he made a wise choice, for the \"Lika\r\nJoko\" of later times had been a close student of politics, and seemed\r\ncut out for the post. How he justified himself is sufficiently known; he\r\nachieved for himself a great popularity, and unquestionably acquired for\r\n_Punch_ a unique position among journals, as representing to the people\r\nthat personal side of Parliamentary life, the familiar aspect and the\r\n_vie intime_ of the House of Commons, not to be found elsewhere. No\r\ndoubt, here and there some offence was taken; and wives would at times\r\nprotest against the caricatures of husbands' figures, clothes, or faces;\r\nbut as a rule the \"truthful falsehood\" was appreciated by Mr. Furniss's\r\nvictims--many of whom would ask to be included in his pictures--and few\r\nfrequenters of the Lobby were more popular than he.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone's collars\" are a by-word in the land; and Mr. Furniss\r\nmade them. It is generally recognised that Mr. Gladstone wore no such\r\ncollars. Nevertheless, his favourite sitting attitude in the House was\r\none very low down, his chin buried in his chest; and the more tired or\r\ndepressed he was--the more weary or dejected at the course of the\r\ndebate--the more his head would sink within his collar, and the more the\r\nlinen rose. This fact gave Mr. Furniss the idea, in the course of a few\r\nsessions, of his drawing of \"Mr. Gladstone's Choler Getting Up;\" and\r\nthereon was based his popular fiction. Similarly, the representation of\r\nLord Randolph Churchill as a small boy of irrepressible \"cheek\" was at\r\nfirst intended to typify the noble lord's irrepressible unimportance in\r\nthe Chamber (that was before he had risen from the Fourth Party\r\nleadership to the Chancellorship of the Exchequer); while the creation\r\nof the complacent, many-chinned descendant of the Plantagenets in \"The\r\nHouse of Harcourts\"--a page imagined and drawn in greatest haste\r\nstraight on to the wood-block, to fill up--was received with uproarious\r\ndelight by the public as a true piece of satirical humour. But of all\r\nhis \"types\" the funniest, as well as the easiest, was the ungainly but\r\nside-splitting caricature of Sir Richard Temple--which helped not a\r\nlittle to spread his fame throughout the land. All these men took the\r\nfun in the best of good part, Sir William Harcourt only protesting--not\r\nwhen Harry Furniss endowed him with an extra chin, but when he did not\r\ncredit him with the full complement of hair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HURRIED NOTE.\r\n\r\n(_By Harry Furniss._)]\r\n\r\nTo obtain his portraits Mr. Furniss would stalk his quarries unawares:\r\nfor self-consciousness in a sitter kills all character. A favourite ruse\r\nwas for him to tell Mr. A. that he wanted to sketch Mr. B., and that his\r\nwork would be greatly facilitated if the hon. member would keep the\r\nother in conversation. Mr. A. would enter gleefully into the joke, and\r\nthen Harry Furniss would sketch _Mr. A!_ If need be, he would make his\r\nsketch, unseen and unseeing, upon a piece of cardboard or in a\r\nsketch-book, in the side-pocket of his overcoat. In this way detail,\r\nmannerism, gesture, pose--character, in fact, would be secured, and next\r\nweek's _Punch_ might contain the portrait--sometimes severe, generally\r\nhumorous, and always well-observed. A rapid worker, too, is\r\nFurniss--incomparably the quickest of his colleagues--who could produce\r\nanything from a thumbnail sketch to a full-page drawing, portraits and\r\nall, in an hour or so, although he would prefer, of course, to have fair\r\ntime to arrange his composition, to pencil it in, and then work it up\r\ncarefully from the living model. On the occasion when Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill's hunting adventures in South Africa kept London amused, Mr.\r\nFurniss, who was in the country and about to start for town by rail, saw\r\nan account of the exploit in the morning paper. He wired to Mr. Burnand:\r\n\"See Churchill's lion-hunt, page -- 'Times.' Splendid opportunity.\r\nReply ---- Junction.\" At ten-thirty he found the answer awaiting him at\r\nthe junction: \"Good. Let engravers have it to-day.\" He set to work at\r\nonce in the train. Having to change several times, he found the\r\njunctions of great use for drawing in the faces; and by half-past four\r\nthe finished page was in Mr. Swain's possession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO FRIENDS.\r\n\r\n(_By Harry Furniss._)]\r\n\r\nIndefatigable and unconventional, as much a journalist as an artist,\r\ngifted with a rapid intelligence and a subacid humour, Mr. Furniss, in\r\nhis work on _Punch_, has been extremely varied, and by the strength of\r\nhis personality he imparted to the Parliamentary side of the paper a\r\ntouch of his own convictions. It was obvious from his treatment of the\r\nIrish that he was a strong Unionist, and that his sympathy with the\r\nIrish party was neither very deep nor very cordial. This was emphasised\r\nby some of the best caricatures he ever produced. They were bitterly\r\nresented; but probably more ill-feeling was created by the ludicrous\r\npicture he subsequently drew of the patriots as they returned, sea-sick,\r\nmoist, and dejected, to Dublin from the \"London Conference,\" entitled \"A\r\nSketch at Kingstown.\" On the top of this came the irritation caused by\r\nhis laughable but merciless mimicry, in his famous entertainment of \"The\r\nHumours of Parliament,\" of the imaginary Member for Ballyhooly; but it\r\nwas the caricatures of Mr. Swift MacNeill, M.P., that brought matters to\r\na head. Mr. MacNeill had previously appreciated the sketches, and begged\r\ncertain of them. But at last, on the occasion of an exuberant and\r\nunflattering, but still not an ill-humoured, portrait, supported by a\r\nsolid contingent of his Party, he sought the artist out and, reproaching\r\nhim in excited and unmeasured terms, he committed a \"technical assault\"\r\nupon him. Mr. Furniss was not to be induced to retaliate, even when Dr.\r\nTanner, M.P., and others who surrounded him addressed him in words more\r\nviolent and offensive than Mr. MacNeill's, and threatened him with\r\ncorporal punishment. As it appeared to the draughtsman that it was all a\r\npre-arranged affair, he remained passive, lest a development of the\r\nsituation should lead--as it was probably intended that it should\r\nlead--to his exclusion from the Lobby. _Punch_ himself, however, snapped\r\nhis fingers at this _argumentum baculinum_, and Mr. Furniss, with rare\r\ngood taste, revenged himself by a full-page drawing (21st September,\r\n1893) of \"A House of Apollo-ticians,\" in which every member has been\r\nidealised to a point of extraordinary personal beauty, while the artist\r\nhimself appears in the corner as a malignant ape of hideous aspect. This\r\nwas balm, no doubt, to the gentleman who had been so incensed at being\r\n\"caricatured, now as a potato, now as a gorilla;\" while the situation\r\nwas cleverly summed up thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"O, Mr. MacNeill was quite happy until a\r\n  Draughtsman in _Punch_ made him like a gorilla--\r\n  At the Zoo the gorilla quite happy did feel\r\n  Till the draughtsman in _Punch_ made him like the MacNeill.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, several series of importance had come from his pencil. His\r\n\"Puzzle-heads\" are marvels of ingenuity, in each of which a portrait of\r\na celebrity is built up of personal attributes, characteristics, or\r\nincidents in the career of the person represented; his Lika Joko\r\n\"Japanneries\" caught with amazing truth the spirit of Japanese\r\ndraughtsmanship--far more completely than either Bennett or Brunton ever\r\nsucceeded in achieving; and his \"Interiors and Exteriors\" reflect social\r\nand public life with exuberant, almost with extravagant, humour.\r\n\r\nBut the end of his connection with _Punch_ was at hand. He had joined in\r\nOctober, 1880. He had been called to the Table four years later, and on\r\nthe 21st February, 1894, he ate his last dinner at it, and resigned in\r\nthe following month. Meanwhile, like Charles Keene, he was never one of\r\nthe salaried Staff, but to the end was paid by the square inch. This\r\npermitted him to do as much work as he chose for other papers; but it\r\nmade him feel, at the same time, that he was not flesh of their flesh,\r\nwhile he suspected himself of getting into a cast-iron groove from which\r\nhe sought to free himself. So, after a minor \"misunderstanding\" had been\r\nput right, Mr. Furniss quitted his old friend _Punch_, and forthwith set\r\nabout starting a monthly magazine of his own. This enterprise, in the\r\ncourse of evolution, was considerably modified; and for a time the\r\nweekly \"Lika Joko\" soon emerged into open rivalry with the paper which\r\nfor nearly fourteen years had made the name of Furniss as celebrated\r\nthroughout all English-speaking lands as that of any of his colleagues.\r\n\r\nAnd such is the Passing of Furniss, whose extraordinary powers of\r\nobservation (he was the first, by the way, to detect and represent\r\ntruthfully Mr. Gladstone's loss of a digit) and of catching a likeness\r\nin its essential lines, and whose unbounded and buoyant good-humour\r\nearly justified Mr. Burnand's selection. Though he so soon drifted into\r\nParliamentary sketching, there is no class of work, except the\r\nofficially-recognised political \"cartoons,\" which he did not attempt;\r\nand he romped through _Punch's_ pages with unlimited invention and\r\ninexhaustible resource--with comedy and farce, with drama and tragedy,\r\nand sometimes with work startling in its truth and touching in its\r\npathos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"A HAPPY RELEASE.\"--A REJECTED SKETCH.\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by C. J. Lillie._)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe men who immediately followed Mr. Harry Furniss did not come to stay.\r\nIn December, 1880, a sketch of \"Cherry Unripe\"--a clever parody on Sir\r\nJohn Millais' famous picture--was contributed by Mr. Stowers, who then\r\nrested on his laurels. Mr. Finch Mason contributed three sporting cuts\r\nin 1881, three in 1882, and one in the following year, and then Mr.\r\nCharles J. Lillie appeared on the scene. Mr. Lillie's principal\r\nvictories have been won in the field of poster-designing, his favourite\r\nachievement being the design of a young lady in bathing costume who,\r\nbeing wrecked, succeeded by the aid of Somebody's Soap, with the\r\ncleverness of her sex, in \"washing herself ashore.\" At the time when Mr.\r\nHerkomer was designing his famous poster for the \"Magazine of Art,\" Mr.\r\nLillie submitted to _Punch_ a set of humorous sketches nominally adapted\r\nto similar advertisements of wines. Thus, \"Port: Old and Crusty,\" was of\r\ncourse a typical Colonel Chutnee, a fire-eating Anglo-Indian; \"Sherry:\r\nPale and Dry,\" was an ascetic philosopher; \"Claret: Very Light and\r\nDelicate,\" was a maiden dainty and graceful; and so forth. Some of\r\nthese were published in the early summer of 1881; but that of\r\n\"Champagne\" (here reproduced) was not used. Shortly afterwards the\r\nclever draughtsman sought work and adventure in Europe, Africa, and\r\nAmerica, and on his return devoted himself to story-writing, confining\r\nhis pencil to the illustration of his own articles. Like Mr. Sambourne\r\nand others of Mr. Punch's artistic contributors, Mr. Lillie was trained\r\nas an engineer.\r\n\r\nAs already recounted, a new idea was carried into effect in _Punch's_\r\nAlmanac for 1882: drawings were sought from certain members of the Royal\r\nAcademy who were supposed to be afflicted with the _vis comica_ in any\r\npronounced degree. Of these, only Mr. G. A. Storey made his début in\r\n_Punch_ on this occasion; but his drawing of \"Little Snowdrop\"--a fancy\r\ncharacter-portrait of a Dutch lady--pretty as it was, displayed but a\r\nvery mild sort of humour. In the following February Mr. Alfred Bryan\r\nbegan his series of \"Sketches by Boz,\" in which public men of the day\r\nwere caricatured as personages in Dickens' novels. Thus, the Duke of\r\nCambridge was most happily identified with \"Joe Bagstock, Sir!\", Sir\r\nJohn Holker was the Fat Boy, and Mr. Bradlaugh appeared as Rogue\r\nRiderhood \"taking his Davy.\" These clever sketches, to the number of\r\ntwenty-seven, were spread over that year and the next, when, to the\r\nregret of both Editor and artist, the connection was unavoidably\r\nsevered.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[64] Mr. Sambourne's cartoons are dealt with in the chapter devoted to\r\nthat subject.\r\n\r\n[65] It may be as well to give here the names of the diners, so that the\r\nreader may identify them in the reproduction which forms the\r\nfrontispiece to this volume. Mr. Burnand, at the head of the table, with\r\nhis left hand outstretched towards the figure of _Punch_, is giving the\r\ntoast of the evening; on his left is Mr. Anstey, and then Mr. Lucy and\r\nMr. E. T. Reed, the late Gilbert à Beckett and Mr. Milliken, Sir W.\r\nAgnew, the late Mr. W. H. Bradbury, Mr. du Maurier, Mr. Furniss and Mr.\r\nR. C. Lehmann, Mr. Arthur à Beckett, Mr. Sambourne, and Sir John\r\nTenniel. The portraits and busts along the wall are (from left to right)\r\nof Mark Lemon, Gilbert Abbott à Beckett, with, under it, Douglas\r\nJerrold, Thackeray, Doyle, Hood, Leech, Shirley Brooks, and Tom Taylor.\r\nOn the easel is a portrait of Charles Keene, then recently dead.\r\n\r\n[66] This is all very well; but as the alleged visit took place in 1870,\r\nthe year in which Caldecott came up to London, and as Mark Lemon died on\r\nthe 23rd of May in that year, and that not suddenly, the story is hardly\r\nabove suspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n_PUNCH'S_ ARTISTS: 1882-95.\r\n\r\n     Mr. William Padgett--Mr. E.

Boyd--Mr. Phil May--A Test of\r\n     Drunkenness--Mr. Stafford--\"Caran d'Ache\"--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time as the single sketch signed with a swan (by Mr.\r\nThompson), Mr. William Padgett, the excellent painter of poetical\r\nlandscape, made his unique appearance. He had been arranging the\r\nmock-æsthetic costumes for Mr. Burnand at the Prince of Wales's Theatre,\r\nwhen \"The Colonel\" was about to deal a crushing blow at the absurdities\r\nof the \"artistic craze.\" Mr. Padgett had painted the large picture\r\ncalled \"Ladye Myne\"--a burlesque of the \"greenery-yallery\" type then in\r\nfashion at the Grosvenor Gallery; and the departure of the apostle of\r\nthe movement from these shores for the United States inspired the\r\npainter with the words and the drawing of the mourning \"Ariadne,\" which\r\nwere shown to the Editor of _Punch_ and forthwith inserted. The only\r\nother stranger of 1882 was Mr. Pigott, with a single sketch entitled\r\n\"Cultcha.\"\r\n\r\nThe six years that followed were almost a close time for outsiders. The\r\nonly arrival of 1883 was Mr. Everard Morant Cox, an artist of dainty\r\nimagination and graceful pencil, whose seven charming little cuts\r\nappeared at intervals up to July, 1890. The next was Mr. John Page\r\nMellor, barrister-at-law (appointed in 1894 Solicitor to the Treasury),\r\nwho contributed three drawings from 1886 to 1888--\"Sub Punch and\r\nJudice\" (p. 305, Vol. XCI.), which was partly re-drawn; a skit on the\r\nproposed Wheel and Van Tax (p. 205, Vol. XCIV.); and the \"Judges going\r\nto Greenwich,\" signed with mystic Roman numerals. In the same year Mr.\r\nHarper Pennington, the American artist, made a couple of drawings of the\r\nopera of \"The Huguenots,\" followed by a sketch of Mr. Whistler and\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nSir Frederic Leighton, President of the Royal Academy, once paid homage\r\nto _Punch_ by the contribution of a single drawing--a portrait of Miss\r\nDorothy Dene--which illustrated an article entitled \"The Schoolmaster\r\nAbroad,\" and was published on May 29th, 1886 (Vol. XC.). It is one of\r\nthe few tint blocks that have appeared in the paper, and is, strictly\r\nspeaking, not a woodcut at all, but a wood-engraving.\r\n\r\nMr. G. H. Jalland began his genuinely comic hunting sketches in 1888.\r\nAlthough an amateur, Mr. Jalland is often extremely happy in his\r\ndrawings (which now and again are excellently drawn), and his jokes are\r\nusually conceived in a richly comic vein. A great many--nearly a\r\nhundred--of his subjects were published during 1889, and he is still an\r\noccasional contributor to the fun of the week. We would not willingly\r\nlose the artist who gave us the sketch of a Frenchman bawling during a\r\nhunt: \"Stop ze chasse! _Stop ze fox!!!_ I tomble--I falloff!\" The\r\nsportsman's mantle, which fell from Leech's shoulders on to Miss\r\nBowers', and then on to Mr. Corbould's, descended at last on to those of\r\nMr. Jalland, who wore it almost exclusively for a time, and, from the\r\nhumorist's point of view, wore it easily and well.\r\n\r\nMonsieur G. Darré, who had worked in Paris on the \"Charivari\" for a\r\ncouple of years, and for a short time on the \"Journal Amusant,\" \"Le\r\nGrelot,\" \"Le Carillon,\" and others, besides making a series of\r\nillustrations for a monumental \"Histoire de France,\" came to London in\r\n1883. Five years later, at the suggestion of Mr. Swain--who had already\r\ncut some of his work for other periodicals--he sent in his first sketch\r\nto _Punch_. This was a drawing of \"Joseph's Sweetheart,\" at the\r\nVaudeville, showing great mastery over pen-and-ink. It was followed\r\nduring this year and the next with sketches of varied importance,\r\ntheatrical and political, in which France and General Boulanger played\r\nchief part, and in which portraits were always well rendered; but when\r\nthe thirteenth had been delivered--(alas! the fatal number)--the arrival\r\nof Mr. Bernard Partridge convinced him that there would no longer be\r\nroom for him. After contributing for a time to other illustrated papers,\r\nthe artist made himself proudly independent of black-and-white by\r\nbecoming a successful designer of show-cards in water-colour for\r\ncommercial houses. He may claim to have introduced, in a small way, a\r\nmore clashing style into _Punch_ than had hitherto been seen there; but\r\nthough his drawings, especially those on his native politics, were\r\nundeniably clever and very effective, they lacked true artistic quality\r\nand _Punch's_ essential spirit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E. T. REED.\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by Himself._)]\r\n\r\nSome sketches signed \"C. A. M.\" were sent in, in 1889, by Mr. C. A.\r\nMarshall, solicitor of Retford, Notts. Their chief merit appeared to be\r\nthe excellence of the horse-drawing; but only a couple of them were\r\naccepted, and these were published in the course of the year.\r\n\r\nThe great arrival of the year was Mr. E. T. Reed, who was to bring a new\r\nform of humour into _Punch_--or, rather, to bring back the old,\r\nrollicking, genuine low-comedy class of fun, more generous and\r\nmirth-provoking than the higher comedy of the day, that aims but to\r\ninduce a smile.\r\n\r\nHis appearance in _Punch_ (on the 8th of June, 1889) was due to the\r\ncasual remark of Mr. Linley Sambourne to Mr. Blake Wirgman that the\r\nEditor was looking round for some new man who could do comic work. Mr.\r\nWirgman suggested their common friend, Mr. Reed, whom, however, Mr.\r\nSambourne only knew as a painter-student, and the latter promised to\r\nsend some of his sketches to Mr. Burnand to look at. The upshot was a\r\nrequest for a drawing representing \"The Parnell Commissioners enjoying\r\nthemselves up the River\" during a pause in the trial of Parnell _v._ the\r\n\"Times.\" Other drawings, that attracted general attention, followed in\r\nrapid succession. Who that has seen it can forget the \"Fancy Portrait\"\r\n(by induction) \"of my Laundress\"--a brawny-armed woman standing over his\r\nshirts, which she belabours with a spike-studded club? or the \"Automatic\r\nPoliceman\" at a crowded crossing, which, when a penny is dropped into\r\nthe slot, puts up its arm and stops the traffic? or the \"Restored\r\nSkeleton of a Bicyclist,\" and other \"happy thoughts\" of that period? It\r\nwas obvious that the draughtsman was not a practised artist, although a\r\nskilful amateur; but those who detected the artistic lack of training\r\nforgave it heartily for the genuine fun and originality of a fresh and\r\ndelightful kind. Since that time Mr. Reed rapidly developed his\r\nundoubted powers, which, for a young man who did not begin to draw until\r\nhe was twenty-three years of age, showed themselves at once to be\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nThen followed a clever series of \"Contrasts,\" such as the professional\r\nfasting man fortune-making at the Aquarium, and a Balaclava hero left to\r\nstarve by a grateful country--thus repeating unconsciously Cruikshank's\r\nfamous plate of \"Born a Genius: Born a Dwarf,\" wherein the tragedy of\r\nBenjamin Robert Haydon and the triumph of Tom Thumb, both proceeding in\r\nthe Egyptian Hall, were dramatically depicted. Another, and still more\r\nremarkable, contrast of Mr. Reed's was that in which the terrible\r\n_tricoteuses_ of the French Revolution, knitting with quite tragic\r\njoviality before the guillotine, are compared with the modern Society\r\nladies in court enjoying a criminal's sensational trial, so that the\r\nspectator hardly knows which are the more repellent. It may be stated,\r\nas a matter of curiosity, that--except for the point of contrast, which,\r\nafter all, is a principal feature of the design--Doyle anticipated Mr.\r\nReed's protest by showing, in 1849, a \"Scene in Court during an\r\ninteresting Trial,\" when the crime of Manning and his wife was\r\nengrossing the attention of all England and proving a \"great attraction\"\r\nto _dames du monde_.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Mr. Burnand raised his young recruit to the rank of\r\nStaff-officer to fill the vacancy which had just occurred--a premature\r\npromotion, the wiseacres said. Mr. Reed then produced his forensic\r\ndrawings, often basing them on sketches supplied by Sir Frank Lockwood,\r\nQ.C.; yet his work fluctuated so much in quantity that it was more than\r\nonce rumoured that he and _Punch_ had parted company. But in due course\r\nhis triumph came when, in the Christmas number of 1893, he began\r\n\"Prehistoric Peeps\"--including \"The First Hansom,\" \"Primeval Billiards,\"\r\nand \"A Quiet Game of Whist in Primeval Times.\" These popular fancies\r\nwere no sudden inspiration; they were developed gradually. Following a\r\nnatural humorous bent for dealing with sham antiquities in _Punch_, Mr.\r\nReed had started during the previous year a series of \"exhibits\" in the\r\nImperial Institute of the Future, consisting of comic restorations of\r\ncommon objects of to-day--the ridiculous speculations of the future\r\narchæologist. There was a much-patched and battered restoration of a\r\nfour-wheeled cab; then a comic policeman; and the draughtsman was\r\nproceeding with a hansom when he experienced a difficulty in getting\r\nfreshness into the treatment. So he determined to become a Cuvier on his\r\nown account, and, by going back to the beginning, to show the real\r\noriginal hansom, as it might have been, in pre-historic times. The\r\nartist was intensely amused with the idea, and finishing his three\r\ndrawings--the other two suggesting themselves--delivered them just in\r\ntime for the Almanac. The result was, in its way, electrical. Within a\r\nweek everybody was laughing at them and talking about them. In the\r\n\"Daily News\" a leading-article was devoted to arguing, with admirable\r\nmock-gravity, that the artist's object in these drawings--especially in\r\nthat of the Prehistoric Parliament, in which all our legislators are\r\nclad in primeval fashion, while the Speaker keeps order with the aid of\r\nan enormous tomahawk--was, of course, to prove the theory that\r\nsimilarity of face and figure accompanies similarity of pursuit\r\nthroughout the generations. At Cambridge, in the May Week, the _tableaux\r\nvivants_ of the \"Footlights Society\" included exact reproductions of the\r\n\"Primeval Billiards\" and \"No Bathing To-day!\"--skins, expressions,\r\nmastodons and all; while at Molesey Invitation Regatta (August, 1894)\r\nthe \"Prehistoric Coaching for the Boat Race\" was carried out to the life\r\nin mid-river, with Gaul and Briton, woad-stained skins, raft, and fight,\r\nwith the fearsome palæontological intruders, complete to the last\r\ndetail--and applications were quickly made to the _Punch_ Proprietors\r\nfor permission to reproduce the scenes on magic-lantern slides for the\r\nuse of schools! This, perhaps, is to be explained by the accuracy of\r\nmany of the pre-historic beasts. Even at the London Institution a\r\nscientific lecturer has borne witness to the life-likeness of Mr. Reed's\r\n_stegosaurus imglutis_, and especially of the _triceratops_ and the\r\nsprightly _pterodactyle_. Little wonder Sir William Agnew broke through\r\nthe rule of \"no speeches\" at the Wednesday Dinner, and proposed the\r\nhealth of the young artist who had made for the paper so striking a\r\nsuccess. When Mr. Harry Furniss retired, Mr. Reed was appointed his\r\nsuccessor as Parliamentary draughtsman, and soon showed his independence\r\nof humour in his new post.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Whistler had contributed his butterfly (p. 293, Vol.\r\nXCVIII.)--the sign-manual in the use of which he has for some years\r\nfound so much harmless, if rather childish, pleasure--Mr. Maud, at that\r\ntime a Royal Academy student, began his sporting sketches. The first\r\ndrawing (published on p. 249, Vol. C., though it had been sent in six\r\nmonths before) was called \"A Check.\" A country lout is sitting on a\r\nfence-rail shouting, and the hunt comes up. \"Seen the fox, my boy?\" asks\r\nthe huntsman. \"No, I ain't!\" replies the lad. \"Then what are you\r\nhollarin' for?\" \"Because,\" answers the scarecrow, \"because I'm paid for\r\nit.\" This picture was a valuable introduction, procured through a friend\r\nwho forwarded his drawing, for it brought him an invitation to\r\nillustrate \"Romford's Hounds\" and \"Hawbuck Grange,\" as well as an\r\nestablished, though intermittent, connection with _Punch_. With few\r\nexceptions, Mr. Maud's jokes are the result of personal experience, for\r\nhe looks to _contretemps_ in the field for his humorous subjects.\r\nThrough falling with his horse into a big drain in the Belvoir\r\ncountry--a precious accident for him--he collected sufficient matter to\r\nproduce three jokes which duly saw the light. But the collection of such\r\nmaterial is \"damned hard riding,\" and each hunting season has only\r\nbrought forth about ten such productions. Since that time Mr. Maud has\r\nturned his attention to sources of humour other than the hunting-field;\r\nand as in 1893 he carried off the Landseer scholarship and two silver\r\nmedals for painting from the life, it is possible that he may in the\r\nnear future be tempted far from the joyous art of comic black-and-white.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. BERNARD PARTRIDGE.\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by Himself._)]\r\n\r\nMr. Bernard Partridge made his first drawing for _Punch_ in 1891,\r\nthrough the instrumentality of Mr. du Maurier, one of his greatest\r\nadmirers. It was a drawing of a bishop in a distressing and undignified\r\npose, and, though small in size, it proved at once to readers of _Punch_\r\nthe justice of the extraordinary reputation the young artist had gained\r\nelsewhere. It was not only that his drawing and proportion are always\r\nentirely right--that, perhaps, is to be expected in the son of the late\r\nteacher of anatomy at the Royal Academy Schools--but that his handling\r\nis so graceful and dainty, his effects of light and shade so masterly,\r\nhis portraiture so true, and his power of representing expression, as\r\nshown both in face and figure, so absolute. Mr. du Maurier saw in him\r\nhis own successor for the time when he may be called upon to lay the\r\npencil down; and the public recognised in him an appreciator of beauty\r\nto a degree hardly excelled by Mr. du Maurier himself. Being, moreover,\r\nas familiar with the expression of the foreigner as with that of the\r\nEast-Ender, or the resident of \"Buckley Square,\" he was a recruit after\r\nMr. Punch's own heart and interest.\r\n\r\nIt is because Mr. Partridge's love for the stage is stronger than for\r\nthe pencil that the invitation to contribute to _Punch_, and, in 1892,\r\nhis promotion to the regular Staff, did not arouse in him any great\r\nenthusiasm at the time. Soon, however, he warmed up to his work, and his\r\nillustrations to Mr. Anstey's inimitable \"Voces Populi,\" \"The Man from\r\nBlankley's,\" and other of that writer's serials, made their mark at\r\nonce, supported as they were by the \"socials,\" signed now with his\r\ncipher, now with his quaint \"Perdix fecit.\"\r\n\r\nConcurrently with Mr. Partridge (1891), Mr. Everard Hopkins made his\r\nappearance with one of two drawings sent in. The accepted one was an\r\nadmirable travesty of the _dénouement_ of Ibsen's \"Doll's House,\"\r\nrepresenting a buxom middle-aged virago leaving the house of her\r\ndiminutive hen-pecked husband, whose \"birdie\" she declines any longer to\r\nbe. Numerous drawings of a graceful kind have since come from him, until\r\nhe is in the way of being regarded as a recognised outside contributor.\r\n\r\nThen followed Mr. Reginald Cleaver, whose work, somewhat hard, but of\r\ngreat beauty in its own line, has been devoted to \"social\" subjects; and\r\non January 1st, 1892, Mr. W. J. Hodgson sent in a picture that was\r\ndestined to be the first of a long series. He is essentially a sporting\r\nman--a vital necessity for _Punch_--and having been brought up in the\r\nthick of the sporting world, has immortalised in his pages many a\r\nhunting joke and scrap of \"horsey\" humour. His subjects are usually\r\nactualities, and more than once has a whole countryside been startled\r\nby the appearance in _Punch_ of an incident that had just formed matter\r\nfor gleeful conversation after a day's sport. Such was the amusing\r\notter-hunt story that appeared in July, 1894, in which, under the title\r\nof \"The Course of True Love, etc.,\" Miss Di, a six-foot damsel, asks her\r\nfive-foot-three curate-lover to pick her up and carry her across the\r\nwatercourse, \"as it is rather deep, don't you know;\" and the Wiltshire\r\nvillage where it occurred and the chief actors in the little comedy\r\nbecame at once the talk of the county, and the water itself is pointed\r\nout as the scene of the incident. Mr. Hodgson, it may be noted, was\r\nintroduced to _Punch_ through Sir Frank Lockwood, who sent to the Editor\r\na volume which the draughtsman had illustrated.\r\n\r\nMiss Maud Sambourne, when no more than eighteen years of age, also\r\ncontributed her first drawing in the spring of 1892--a charming little\r\nfigure of a girl, as dainty as a sketch by Mr. Abbey, and as different\r\nfrom her father's work as well could be imagined. Similar little\r\ndrawings from her graceful pencil have appeared from time to time, the\r\nprettiest, perhaps, being \"A Fair Unknown,\" on June 2nd, 1894.\r\n\r\nOn November 12th, 1892 (p. 221, Vol. CIII.), appears an elaborate page\r\nof verses, explanatory notes, and four cuts illustrative of \"The\r\nVanishing Rupee\"--a picture greatly appreciated in India. The originator\r\nof this satirical page was Mr. J. H. Roberts, an architect who had\r\nturned his back on his profession and had cast in his lot with\r\nillustrated journalism; and the manner in which he hit off the standing\r\ngrievance of Anglo-India betrayed a touching personal interest in this\r\npainful fiscal question.\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur A. Sykes, more closely identified with _Punch_ as a verse and\r\nprose writer than as a draughtsman, began the first of his sketches in\r\nNovember, 1893; and on the 18th of the same month Sir Frank Lockwood,\r\nQ.C., who had hitherto been content to see his artistic effervescence\r\nre-drawn by Mr. E. T. Reed, appeared in his own right with a comic\r\nscribble representing a barrister afflicted with a bad cold\r\nenergetically addressing the court. It was entitled: \"Cold, but\r\nIn-vig-orating\"--a pictorial pun worthy of Hood or Hine. This was the\r\nfirst of a series.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the distinguished draughtsman, Mr. Arthur Hopkins, who\r\nhas rarely been surpassed in rendering the simple grace of pretty\r\nEnglish girlhood, evolved a joke while shopping with his wife, and\r\nstraightway illustrated it and sent it on to _Punch_. It appeared the\r\nnext week, and was quickly followed by another on the 1st of April.\r\nSince then the artist has been seen no more in _Punch's_ pages,\r\nalthough, jokes serving, he is still a _persona grata_ in Whitefriars.\r\nMr. J. F. Sullivan--the immortal depictor of the humours and amenities\r\nof \"The British Workman,\" and for many years the incarnation of\r\n\"Fun\"--struck up a belated connection with _Punch_, also in November,\r\n1893. His drawings ran continuously during that and the next two months\r\nto the number of a dozen or so, and then, with the exception of an \"old\r\nstock\" sketch or two, they incontinently ceased.\r\n\r\nThe Almanac for 1894 witnessed the début of Mr. J. A. Shepherd, who, on\r\nthe strength of his comic \"Zig-Zags at the Zoo,\" was invited by Mr.\r\nBurnand to send in a page. His comic animals, drawn with singular\r\nprecision and skill, and full of character, seemed to hit the popular\r\ntaste, and, save for a period when ill-health interrupted, Mr. Shepherd\r\nhas continued his contributions. He was a pupil of Mr. Alfred Bryan, and\r\nfor a couple of years was on the staff of \"Moonshine.\" Another recruit\r\nof 1894 was Mr. A. S. Boyd, one of the most brilliant of the \"Daily\r\nGraphic\" staff, and still affectionately remembered as \"Twym\" of the\r\n\"Bailie\" and \"Quiz\" of Glasgow. His first contribution (April 7th) was a\r\nsketch of a lady in an omnibus, whose outrageously large sleeves\r\nextinguished her neighbours as effectually as the crinoline of her\r\ngrandmother (according to John Leech) had cancelled her grandfather.\r\nSince that time Mr. Boyd has been seen fitfully in _Punch_, and always\r\nwith drawings executed with great care and with singular appreciation of\r\nthe value of his blacks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHIL MAY.\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by Himself._)]\r\n\r\nThen came Mr. Phil May. _Punch_ was long in discovering him, but he\r\nfound him at last. Indeed, he could not afford to do without him, for\r\nMr. May, though barely more than thirty years of age, was already in the\r\nforemost rank of humorous draughtsmen of the day, and few--even of Mr.\r\nPunch's own Staff--were better known and more popular than the young\r\nartist who had burst upon the town not long before. He had gone through\r\na hard life as a boy. He had turned his back upon architecture, as\r\nCharles Keene, Mr. Moyr Smith, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Bernard Partridge, and\r\nother contributors to _Punch_ had done before him, and had joined a\r\nstrolling company, with whom he strolled and acted for four years,\r\ndrawing caricatures of his fellow-actors for the shop-windows. He was\r\nonly fourteen when he began sketching for a Yorkshire paper, and four\r\nyears later he came to town and, after an interval of the direst want,\r\nsoon made his mark. At that time he had evidently been looking at Mr.\r\nSambourne's drawings, but a three years' visit to Australia, aided by\r\nthe bitter experience of Melbourne newspaper printing presses,\r\nsimplified his style to the point we now see it--in which elimination of\r\nall unnecessary lines seems carried to its furthermost limit. Indeed,\r\nhis \"economy of means\" borders on parsimony. Gifted with a powerful\r\npersonality, with the keenest sense of humour, and with strong human\r\nsympathies that lean much more to the side of the poor than of the\r\nwell-to-do, and, above all, with a brilliant power of draughtsmanship,\r\nhe was recognised as a master as soon as he asserted himself--an\r\noriginal master with many disciples and more imitators. He cannot be\r\ncalled a caricaturist, for in his work there lacks that fierce quality\r\nof critical conception--above all, that subject-matter that makes one\r\nthink, that sardonic appeal to head and heart at once, which make up the\r\nsum of true caricature. If caricature is drollery, and not humour, as\r\nCarlyle says it is, Mr. May is above all things a humorist, and not at\r\nall a droll. He is neither a politician nor a reformer, nor even, if\r\nproperly understood, a satirist. His aim is to show men and things as\r\nthey really are, seen through a curtain of fun and raillery--not as they\r\nmight or ought to be. Yet the essence of his work is inexorable truth,\r\nand his version of life is depicted to a delighted public with the\r\nunerring pencil of a laughing philosopher. And, moreover, his greatest\r\nquality is the astounding excellence of his draughtsmanship, which, so\r\nfar from being germane to caricature, is not only unnecessary to it, but\r\nsometimes even a hindrance.\r\n\r\nAnd so Mr. May began with his \"social\" cuts for _Punch_, selecting \"low\r\nlife\" for the most part, as Mr. du Maurier chose high life, and making\r\nfor every picture as careful a study from Nature as ever Charles Keene\r\ndid--and probably as many of them. Furthermore, he prefers to seek out\r\nhis jokes for himself. When he was in New York and found that the\r\nprofessional joke-purveyor was untrustworthy, he sauntered into a\r\npolice court in the hope of finding character there, and perhaps humour.\r\nA woman was up before the magistrate on a charge of drunkenness--a\r\ncharge which the lady denied. \"How do you know she was drunk?\" asked the\r\nmagistrate. \"She walked into a baker's shop,\" replied the policeman,\r\n\"and wanted to buy a bonnet.\" The evidence was accepted as conclusive;\r\nand Mr. May sketched the prisoner there and then, and introduced her\r\ninto his first drawing for _Punch's_ page as the gutter-woman who,\r\nlooking over an illustrated paper, confides to a friend that the\r\nportrait it contains of \"Lady Sorlsbury\" isn't a bit like what she\r\nreally is in private life. Mr. May was in due course drawn into\r\n_Punch's_ net, and eating his first Dinner in February, 1895, he cut his\r\ninitials on the Table between those of Thackeray and Mr. du Maurier. The\r\naccompanying sketch was the eloquent announcement I received of his\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I JOINED THE 'PUNCH' TABLE LAST WEEK, AND CARVED MY NAME\r\nON THE ROLL OF FAME.\"]\r\n\r\nIn the Almanac of 1894 two artists new to _Punch_ made their\r\nappearance--the first, Mr. Stafford, the quondam cartoonist of \"Funny\r\nFolks;\" and the other, the world-famous humorist \"Caran d'Ache\" (M.\r\nEmmanuel Poirée), with a satire on the female craze of the day in\r\nrespect to M. Paderewski and his flowing locks. In November of the same\r\nyear Mr. Fred Pegram, who had for three years been one of the \"Judy\"\r\nartists, made his clever appearance in _Punch_, since then several times\r\nrepeated; and with Mr. W. F. Thomas--the well-known successor of Baxter\r\nas the delineator of Ally Sloper and his low but amusing circle--who\r\nappeared twice in 1895, I close my list.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STAFF OF _PUNCH_ AT TABLE, 1895.\r\n\r\n(_From a flash-light photograph, expressly taken by Van der Weyde._)\r\n\r\nMR.

DU MAURIER.]\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that with the exception of a very few among the\r\nearlier comic draughtsmen, and a half-a-dozen others of our own day,\r\n_Punch_ has at one time or another engaged the pencils of all the\r\nchief English graphic humorists of his time, and has even persuaded\r\nnotable artists of more serious turn to try their hand at comic work.\r\n\r\nIn its artistic aspect, at least, _Punch_ is more than a comic journal:\r\nit is, and has been for more than half a century, a school of\r\nwood-drawing, of pen and pencil draughtsmanship, and of wood-cutting of\r\nthe first rank; it is a school of art in itself. The effect of its\r\nart-teaching has been widely felt, and on this ground alone its doings\r\nmust command interest and justify a close examination into its rise and\r\nprogress. So far, too, as one can foretell, its future is safe. Young\r\nmen are arising who are capable of carrying on its traditions and of\r\nbearing its banner bravely and merrily aloft; and it may safely be\r\nassumed that, just as the Royal Academy sooner or later absorbs the best\r\nOutsiders to adorn its circle and keep its vigour green, so _Punch_ will\r\nnever lack the ablest men to don his cap and motley and shake his\r\njingling bells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FINALE: A PROBATIONARY DRAWING (UNUSED).\r\n\r\n(_By Linley Sambourne._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\nSIGNATURES OF _PUNCH'S_ ARTISTS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLIST OF ARTISTS WHOSE SIGNATURES ARE HERE GIVEN.\r\n\r\n   1.
