L.\r\nJUNE, 1896.\r\nNo. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jubilee Year Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract from the appeal of the Executive Committee of the American\r\nMissionary Association:\r\n\r\n                         *Fifty Dollars a Share.*\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to raise during the next six months a special Jubilee Year\r\nFund of $100,000 in shares of $50 each, with the hope and expectation that\r\nthese shares will be taken by the friends of missions without lessening\r\nthose regular contributions which must be depended upon to sustain the\r\ncurrent work.\r\n\r\n                            FORM OF A PLEDGE.\r\n\r\n                               Share, $50.\r\n                                $100,000.\r\n\r\n                          THE JUBILEE YEAR FUND\r\n                                 OF THE\r\n                     AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\nI hereby take ..... shares (Fifty Dollars each) in the Jubilee Year Fund\r\nof the American Missionary Association, to be paid before the close of the\r\nfiscal year, Sept. 30, 1896.\r\n\r\n                                                      _Name_ . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n                                           _P. O. Address_ . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTY-DOLLAR JUBILEE SHARES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last number of THE MISSIONARY we gave the gratifying report of 34\r\nshares taken for this fund, and in the present number we have the pleasure\r\nof adding 75 more. We are fully aware of the difficulties under which we\r\nsend forth the call for responses to this much-needed fund. Other appeals\r\nhave been made, and are still pressed upon the churches, all of them\r\nworthy of the generosity with which they are met.\r\n\r\nBut the ability of the churches to meet the demands of their varied\r\nmission work is not exhausted, and the spirit of consecration among the\r\nfollowers of Christ, even when self-denial must be practiced, has not\r\nreached its limit. We therefore urge our appeal with strong confidence\r\nthat we shall not be felt to be intruders, but that we are simply trying\r\nto fulfill the duty imposed upon us in carrying the Gospel to the most\r\nneedy and destitute in our land.\r\n\r\nWe must repeat the plea made by our Executive Committee that in giving to\r\nthis Jubilee Fund, the contributions for our regular work, to which we are\r\ncommitted and whose claims we cannot repudiate, may not be neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACCEPTABLE MITES.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSONVILLE, GA.--\"Please find inclosed $2.31, which is a contribution\r\nfrom our church toward paying the debt of the American Missionary\r\nAssociation. It is very little, but more than I supposed the people would\r\nraise, there is so little money in the place.\"\r\n\r\nGREENWOOD, S. C.--\"It is a great pleasure to me to hand you herewith bank\r\ndraft for $11, which is the amount of our collection for the Lincoln\r\nMemorial Day. I have delayed the remitting of this amount somewhat to give\r\nothers an opportunity who wished to contribute, but were not quite ready.\r\nThe amount is not large, but it is from the people and expresses in a\r\nmeasure their interest in the work of the American Missionary Association.\r\nThe collection represents offerings of the young and old from a cent to a\r\ndollar. What was done was done with a free heart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO COLOR-LINE IN CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Methodist General Conference and the hotels in Cleveland, O., deserve\r\ngreat credit--the hotels for according to all delegates, regardless of\r\ncolor, equal accommodations, and the Conference for its hearty indorsement\r\nof their action. If this greatest gathering of the largest Protestant\r\nchurch in America had nothing else to do, it might go with its grand\r\nmeeting from city to city securing this recognition of the brotherhood of\r\nman. It is ardently hoped that the generous and liberal-minded hotel\r\nkeepers in Cleveland may not \"backslide,\" and that if any single colored\r\ndelegate, clerical or lay, should come alone to Cleveland, even before the\r\nclose of the \"six months’ probation,\" he might not find the door closed\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church may be equally useful at\r\nits meeting in Saratoga in preaching this same gospel of the brotherhood\r\nof man, and in this case, too, permanency is very desirable, and it is\r\nhoped, therefore, that in this event there may be the illustration of the\r\ngood old Presbyterian doctrine of the \"perseverance of the saints.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE PARK NORMAL AND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL IN FLORIDA CLOSED BY THE SHERIFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that on Friday, the 10th of April, seven teachers\r\nand two patrons of the Orange Park School, at Orange Park, Fla., were\r\narrested for violation of an enactment legalized a year ago by the State\r\nLegislature under the instigation of William H. Sheats, the State\r\nsuperintendent of education.\r\n\r\nThe enactment, which we protest is in no just sense a law, forbids not\r\nonly white and colored persons to be instructed within the same building\r\nat the same time, but it also forbids a white principal or matron or\r\nguardians of the school rooming or living within the same building where\r\ntheir pupils are.\r\n\r\nThis enactment against the personal rights of education in a private\r\nChristian school not supported or aided by the State, if sustained, would\r\ndestroy nearly all of the institutions carried on by Northern benevolence\r\nin all of our Southern States. It would take the guardianship of manners\r\nand morals out of the hands of those who have planted and sustained the\r\ninstitutions until now, and who, in view of the millions yet uneducated\r\nand untrained, are now needed as much as ever. It is not surprising,\r\ntherefore, that the National Council of Congregational Churches at\r\nSyracuse in October requested the Association to take this question to the\r\nhighest courts, nor that the General Conference of the Methodist Church in\r\nCleveland has just passed a resolution denouncing this iniquitous\r\nenactment, or that we are receiving constantly from our State and local\r\nassociations assurances of sympathy and support in our contest against\r\nthis reversion to barbarism. We quote a few of the opinions which have\r\ncome under our observation.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Congregationalist_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The ethics of Christ, Pilgrim traditions, and the U. S.\r\n    Constitution seemed paramount to the opinions of Florida\r\n    legislators, and the highest officials of the American Missionary\r\n    Association decided to defy and test the law. That the\r\n    denomination stands back of them may be reasonably inferred from\r\n    the resolution passed by the last Triennial National Council. Let\r\n    the American Missionary Association have the sinews of war with\r\n    which to employ the ablest counsel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the _Outlook_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The State of Florida not long ago took action which is a disgrace\r\n    to itself and a blot on the fair fame of our republic. Let our\r\n    people squarely face this issue. While we are protesting against\r\n    the treatment of missionaries in Turkey and calling upon the\r\n    Government to use all its power in their protection, Christian\r\n    teachers widely known and honored in one of the great States of\r\n    this republic are arrested simply because they presumed to\r\n    instruct a few white children under the same roof with colored\r\n    children.  It is hard to speak of such conduct in mild words. The\r\n    question as to whether this is in reality a free republic is once\r\n    more at issue. The action of the State of Florida is as barbaric\r\n    as the persecutions of the Middle Ages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the _Independent_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Let the reader observe that this is not a law applying merely to\r\n    the public schools of the State. Such a law we condemn, but we\r\n    could not be surprised at it. This law is directed at this\r\n    particular institution, which is not a public school but a private\r\n    academy supported by the American Missionary Association. We have\r\n    been amazed that in this nineteenth century Christians could be\r\n    massacred by the thousands for not accepting the Moslem faith and\r\n    no hand raised to defend them. But that was in Turkey. Here in the\r\n    United States more than thirty years after the Proclamation of\r\n    Emancipation in one of the sovereign States of the Union, half a\r\n    dozen men and women are arrested for the crime of treating black\r\n    children and white children alike, for not drawing a caste line in\r\n    their own private grounds in a school they conduct at no expense\r\n    to the State. It is a curious humiliating occurrence for this\r\n    Jubilee year of the American Missionary Association.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the _Advance_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Florida’s disgraceful Sheats law, specially designed for the\r\n    teachers and supporters of Orange Park Academy, has at last been\r\n    put in force. The teachers of the Academy, the pastor of the\r\n    church, and the parents of the white pupils have been arrested for\r\n    violation of this law, which forbids any one to maintain or\r\n    patronize a school in which white persons and Negroes shall be\r\n    taught or boarded within the same building.\r\n\r\n    And this is the State of Senator Call, who is declaiming so\r\n    eloquently in behalf of the Cuban insurgents, more than half of\r\n    whom are of Negro blood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the _Boston Standard_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"A year ago the unconstitutional and vile Sheats law was passed by\r\n    the legislature of Florida. It was understood that this law was\r\n    particularly aimed at the Orange Park School, of the American\r\n    Missionary Association, whose fiftieth anniversary is to be\r\n    celebrated in this city next fall. This villainous statute was\r\n    enforced in the case of the Orange Park School on the entire body\r\n    of teachers, white men and women of spotless character and\r\n    self-sacrificing devotion to the mission, because of educating\r\n    teachers for the elevation of American citizenship. The normal\r\n    school is one of the best and most useful of the educational\r\n    agencies at work in the South, but had dared to ignore the\r\n    outrageous statute which makes it a crime for any school, public\r\n    or private, to teach black and white scholars in the same building\r\n    or have any white teachers to eat and sleep in the same house with\r\n    their Negro pupils. If these discretionary rights are not\r\n    guaranteed by our national Constitution to American citizens, then\r\n    the professed abolition of slavery and of the color line in\r\n    citizenship is a wretched farce. Nobody can question the intent of\r\n    the proclamation of emancipation of the constitutional amendment\r\n    that places the Negro on the same legal plane with the white\r\n    citizen of this country. We do not doubt the supreme and binding\r\n    authority of this legislature. We mistake the temper of the\r\n    American people if a blaze of indignation is not kindled by this\r\n    outrage from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom _Frank Leslie’s Weekly_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Under these provisions no citizen of Florida, it will be noted,\r\n    can under certain conditions educate his child. He is excluded\r\n    absolutely from the best educational institutions in the State if\r\n    these admit pupils of both white and colored parentage. The\r\n    defiance of the law was in obedience to a definite determination\r\n    on the part of the American Missionary Association to make a\r\n    distinct test of the statute.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the _Boston Daily Advertiser_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The Sheats law in Florida was passed through the influence of\r\n    malice, prejudice, and partisan venom. Efforts have been made in\r\n    other Southern States to perpetrate similar outrages, but for the\r\n    most part without avail. The better public sentiment all over the\r\n    South is strongly against such meanness. This better sentiment has\r\n    asserted itself successfully elsewhere, and we do not doubt that\r\n    it will do so very soon in Florida.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the _Boston Journal_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The American Missionary Association will be sustained by an\r\n    enlightened public sentiment in fighting to the last resort the\r\n    outrageous Florida law which makes it a crime to teach colored and\r\n    white pupils in the same school.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThese comments are but samples of the sentiment which comes to the\r\nAssociation respecting this attempt to challenge the constitutional\r\namendment which came with the emancipation of the colored people from\r\nslavery. But now there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SECOND CHAPTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the teachers were arrested it was supposed that this would be the\r\nend of the persecution until the statute should be tested by the courts.\r\nAccordingly they returned to the work in the school as before. On the 4th\r\nof May the Sheriff was instructed by the State Attorney to inquire into\r\nthis continued violation of the law, and if he found the school to be\r\ngoing on as before, to arrest and rearrest, as long as the school should\r\nbe continued. In consequence the school was forced to close its sessions,\r\nas the teachers were informed that they would be arrested over and over\r\nagain, and that new bail would be required for every successive day; this\r\nnot only for the teachers but for the patrons, which would be impossible\r\nin the case of those who are colored. This is in accordance with the\r\npublished pronouncement of Supt. Sheats that he will prosecute and\r\npersecute this Orange Park School out of existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMBERS OF THE ALBANY CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are desirous of securing the names of the survivors of the little band\r\nthat gathered in Albany fifty years ago, and formed the American\r\nMissionary Association. A few years since, we made a similar call to this\r\nin the pages of THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY, but the responses were very few.\r\nAt the present date, we know of only two persons, Rev. John H. Byrd,\r\nLawrence, Kan., and Rev. Peter B. Thayer, Garland, Me., who were present\r\nat that time. We hope, if there are any other survivors, they will write\r\nto us promptly, and if there are persons whose eyes fall on this little\r\nnotice who happen to know of any person who was present at that meeting,\r\nwe will be much obliged if they will send us the name and address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR CHURCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe intend to present to our readers from time to time brief sketches of\r\nsome of our churches located in the South and elsewhere, with some account\r\nof the condition of the membership as to property and education, with\r\nglimpses of their poverty and hard struggles to support the pastor, with\r\noccasionally the cheerful story of those who reach self-support. On\r\nanother page will be found a sketch by Pastor Snell of the church in\r\nTalladega, Ala.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TALENTED TENTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the discussion concerning Negro education we should not forget the\r\ntalented tenth man. An ordinary education may answer for the nine men of\r\nmediocrity; but if this is all we offer the talented tenth man, we make a\r\nprodigious mistake. The tenth man, with superior natural endowments,\r\nsymmetrically trained and highly developed, may become a mightier\r\ninfluence, a greater inspiration to others than all the other nine, or\r\nnine times nine like them. Without disparagement of faithful men of\r\nmoderate abilities, it may be said that in all ages the mighty impulses\r\nthat have propelled a people onward in their progressive career, have\r\nproceeded from a few gifted souls. Sometimes these have been \"self-made\"\r\nmen, so-called, whose best powers were evoked by rare opportunities.\r\nOftener, they have been men of thoroughly disciplined minds, of sharpened\r\nperceptive faculties, trained to analyze and to generalize; men of\r\nwell-balanced judgments and power of clear and forceful statement.\r\n\r\nIt is this talented tenth man of our colleges that in after years reflects\r\nmore honor on his _alma mater_ than the other nine; it is this tenth man\r\nthat is the recognized leader in his profession and the leader of public\r\nopinion. To him, rather than to the other nine, the many look for\r\nsuggestion and advice in important matters. He is an uncrowned king in his\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nThis being true, I repeat that not to make proper provision for the high\r\neducation of the talented tenth man of the colored people is a prodigious\r\nmistake. It is to dwarf the tree that has in it the potency of a grand\r\noak. Industrial education is good for the nine; the common English\r\nbranches are good for the nine; but that tenth man ought to have the best\r\nopportunities for making the most of himself for humanity and God.\r\n\r\nThe powers of this talented tenth man are often latent; unsuspected by\r\nothers and even by their possessor, and are evoked only under favorable\r\nconditions, sometimes comparatively late in the youthful period of life.\r\nIn a symmetrical course of study calculated to bring into exercise every\r\nmental faculty, somewhere, as by a touchstone, the particular aptitude of\r\nthe pupil may be discovered, the secret springs of power be opened; and\r\nthe man, having discovered himself, leaps forward to pre-eminence among\r\nhis fellows. Scores of such men and women are among the students in the\r\nschools for the colored people of the South. A mere common education will\r\nnot disclose their uncommon powers; they need the test of the best. And\r\nsomewhere, at several central points at least, provision should be made\r\nfor the higher education of the talented tenth as well as ordinary\r\neducation for the other nine.\r\n\r\nThe great need of the colored people of the South is wise leadership along\r\nall lines of development; men of large and comprehensive views acquired by\r\ncontact and communion with the world’s great thinkers; such men are needed\r\nto-day even more than nine times as many with a little more practical\r\nknowledge concerning the use of the saw, the jack-plane and the\r\nblacksmith’s forge. In our educational work for the colored people,\r\ntherefore, proper provision should be made for the talented tenth.--DR.\r\nMOREHOUSE in _The Independent_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALASKA MISSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following sentences from a personal letter of Miss Anna L. Dawes state\r\na profound truth in terse and impressive form:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"If any one is willing to go up there and live with those Eskimos,\r\n    I think the rest of us may well enough agree to help. Indeed,\r\n    nothing has been so good for me for some time as his (Mr. Lopp’s)\r\n    visit. It not only makes our Christianity (mine at least) look\r\n    like a mustard seed, but makes you wonder whether it isn’t a\r\n    _dead_ seed at that! I have been to hear Mr. Moody to-day, but he\r\n    didn’t begin to give me such \"conviction of sin\" as the urgent and\r\n    eager interest Mr. Lopp showed in going back to his people up\r\n    there. I wonder just what the Lord does think of us all--some of\r\n    us, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Lopp, whom Miss Dawes refers to, is pleading for funds to make it\r\npossible to open the mission among the Eskimos. The American Missionary\r\nAssociation was obliged to discontinue it for a year on account of the\r\nstraitened condition of the treasury. We are now making every effort to\r\ngather funds outside of the current income of the Association, that there\r\nmay be at least one Christian mission conducted by Congregationalists in\r\nthis great northern mission field. Mr. Lopp’s plea for \"_his_ people\" and\r\nabandon of self-sacrifice both on the part of himself and his wife,\r\nimpress every one, as they did Miss Dawes.\r\n\r\nThis is the only mission of the Congregational denomination in Alaska. No\r\nother denomination plans to occupy this station if given up by the\r\nAmerican Missionary Association. The work requires about five hundred\r\ndollars more than has been subscribed, and this must be in hand by the\r\nfirst of June, when it is necessary for Mr. Lopp to sail, if he goes this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF A CHURCH IN ALABAMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY REV. SPENCER SNELL.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful and healthful city of Talladega is located among the\r\nAppalachian foot hills. The First Congregational church was organized in\r\nthe year 1868. The first members were people who came out of the colored\r\nBaptist Church, and who had begun to look for a more intelligent mode of\r\nworship and better religious instruction than it was possible to have in\r\nchurches whose pastors had been slaves and were uneducated.\r\n\r\nThe first pastor of the church was Rev. H. E. Brown, of Ridgefield, O.,\r\nwhom the American Missionary Association had sent into the South. Since\r\nhis retirement the pulpit has been occupied by several pastors, including\r\nthe acceptable services of professors of Talladega College. My pastorate\r\nbegan in 1894.\r\n\r\nThere are friendly relations between our church and the other colored\r\nchurches near at hand. The pastor is often invited to preach in the other\r\nchurches. The pastors of two of the Baptist churches are graduates of our\r\nschool here, and the pastor of one of the Methodist churches is now taking\r\nlessons in our seminary.\r\n\r\nThe present membership of the church is 219. Many of them are poor\r\nstudents who have to be helped through school. The resident members have\r\nbut very little money. With one or two exceptions they receive small pay\r\nfor what they do. Those who have trades find but little here to do and\r\nhave to go away to get employment. Among the male members of the church\r\nare farmers, mechanics, etc., and among the females those who do laundry\r\nwork, sewing, etc. Several of these women take the washing of families\r\nhome and work very hard for a very little money with which to subsist\r\ntheir families, buy books, and pay tuition for their children in Talladega\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nThere are about thirty-five members of the church who own their homes, and\r\nabout eleven who rent the places where they live. Several of the homes\r\nowned by the members of the church are fairly comfortable for Southern\r\nhomes, having from two to seven rooms. None of them are costly. I do not\r\nsuppose that one of them cost $1,000. Neither is the furniture in them\r\ncostly. Scarcely any of them have carpets on their floors. They look upon\r\ncarpets as a luxury which they cannot afford. Plaster on the walls is\r\nalmost as rare as carpets on the floors. In some cases there is not a\r\nrocking-chair in the house. The furniture they have is of a very ordinary\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nThe people have but very little money and are obliged to struggle long and\r\nhard to get a little place to call home, in many cases buying the lumber\r\nand hiring the carpenter on credit. This being the case, it takes them\r\nyears and years to pay for the little homes. The homes vary from the\r\nfairly comfortable to the wretched. It is noticeable that those who have\r\nhad the advantages of an education have better homes than those who have\r\nno education.\r\n\r\nThere comes to mind as I write one very miserable home in which both the\r\nparents are ignorant. There are three rooms to the house not nearly so\r\ncomfortable as the places where Northern farmers keep their horses and\r\ncattle. There is neither stove nor grate in the house, but simply some\r\nrocks on each side of the open fireplace on which they lay the green wood,\r\nby which they sit and shiver while the cold winds blow through the cracks\r\nin the floor and sides of the house. There are six children and only two\r\nexcuses for beds. One of these has on it a tick, the other has a pile of\r\ndirty rags. There is not a whole table or chair in the house.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, these people, like many others just as poor as they, are trying\r\nto educate their children. They believe that in Christian education lies\r\nthe only redemption from this condition for them and their race, through\r\ntheir children, who are enjoying privileges that were denied to them.\r\n\r\nThere are not more than a dozen individuals in the church who are earning\r\na comfortable living. More than that number did so when times were better,\r\nbut now there is not much for them to do except conduct very poor farms,\r\non which they cannot earn enough to make themselves comfortable.\r\n\r\nThere have been very few years in the history of the church when it did\r\nnot have a revival of religion. Of late it has been the custom to have two\r\nseries of special services each year--one during the winter, while the\r\nschool is in session, and another during the summer vacation. Effort is\r\nmade each year to have all the students converted. Of all the young people\r\nwho have graduated here only two have left without being professing\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the church has not been rapid, but steady. During the days\r\nof slavery the colored people were members of the churches to which their\r\nmasters belonged. None of them belonged to Congregational churches, and\r\nso, when Congregationalism came to the South after the war, it was\r\nentirely new to the former slaves and to those who had been their masters.\r\n\r\nThe masses of the children and the young people still cling to the\r\nchurches which their parents were taught to love. It will, therefore, be\r\nsome time before Congregationalism will grow rapidly in the South. The\r\nchurch has no building of its own, and no parsonage, but worships in the\r\nchapel of Talladega College. The building in which the chapel is located\r\nwas erected by the white Baptists of the Coosa Valley Association before\r\nthe war as a college for their sons. Some of the old slaves who helped to\r\nput up the building lived to see freedom, to see the building come into\r\nthe hands of the American Missionary Association, and to see their own\r\nchildren study and graduate in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEETINGS AMONG THE HILLS AND AT A CONVICT CAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY REV. H. E. PARTRIDGE.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nowhere is a religious meeting made more of than in the hill\r\ncountry of the South. There are reasons _and_ reasons for the fact. Take a\r\nreal, genuine Methodist or Baptist matron, or brother, of fifty, and they\r\nlove Christ and His cause, and do not fail to associate their love for Him\r\nand the work with the gathering in His name. If it be possible, they will\r\nbe in attendance when \"the parson\" comes round. The girls love to go; some\r\nbecause they, too, are learning to love the service of the Master, some\r\nbecause they have no other so good opportunity to see and be seen, and\r\nothers because everybody else goes. Where the girls and young ladies are\r\nsure to be, there the boys and young men are apt to be; and so it comes\r\nthat when the meeting, especially the \"big meeting,\" is to be held, the\r\npeople throng. And if you want to see a genuine democracy, untainted by\r\nany kind of aristocracy, you could not find it better illustrated than\r\namong the hills, at meeting time, in some log \"church-house.\" No Sir\r\nWonderful to claim best pew, no usher to give you the place _he_ chooses.\r\nYou come with your wife and, following the custom, she goes to the left,\r\nyou to the right. I will not describe the service. The singing varies from\r\na wonderful chorus of praise that lacks nothing in volume in one\r\nneighborhood, to the nasal-twanged hymn which some incompetent leader\r\nsings almost alone in some other community. The old songs predominate, but\r\nany brisk moving song of work of praise or progress easily becomes a\r\nfavorite, when once it has been sung long enough so that the words and\r\nmovement are mastered by a few.\r\n\r\nYou will not be long in any big meeting or revival service before you will\r\nhear:\r\n\r\n  \"Mother has a home, sweet home,\r\n  Mother has a home, sweet home,\r\n  Mother has a home, sweet home.\r\n  Lord, I want to join the angels; beautiful home.\"\r\n\r\nThis is varied. Now it is Brother, Father, Preacher, or Sister who has a\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nYou may not know the tune or words, but it will not be long before you are\r\nsinging with the rest, if you are a participator or worshiper, and not\r\nthat horrid and heartless thing, a critical looker-on.\r\n\r\nYou know of the hand-shaking? If a sinner seeks to enter the Christian\r\nlife, he comes, on invitation of the minister, to shake hands at the close\r\nof, or during, the service. And often service closes with an\r\nall-round-hand-shake. There is a song started, like \"Say, Brother, will\r\nyou meet me?\" or some simple devotional hymn, and all rise and shake hands\r\nall around, singing or praying, or speaking gently one to another.\r\n\r\nAh! many a feud has sunk forever, many an unpleasantness has been\r\nforgotten, many a half-ripe quarrel has been strangled, and many a\r\nfriendship has been strengthened and ripened in these services of emotion\r\nand love, those hand-shakings of the Mountaineers. The blessings of the\r\npeacemakers should be his who first introduced the service.\r\n\r\nAmong other invitation hymns I have heard, I remember vividly:\r\n\r\n  \"Sinner, you are welcome, Yes, Yes, welcome\r\n  To the dying lamb.\"\r\n\r\nThis, too, is varied. \"Seeker,\" \"Brother,\" \"Sister,\" and \"Everybody’s\r\nwelcome\" being sung.\r\n\r\nI could tell of parts I do not like, of excitements the reverse of helpful\r\nto my devotional feelings, and of loudness mistaken for piety or zeal, but\r\nso could others criticise the services at Dr. Cuyler’s or Dr. Storrs’s\r\nchurch. I prefer to speak of the really good.\r\n\r\nMay I tell you of a unique service? It was at the Convict Camp, near\r\nBaker’s X Roads, in Cumberland County, Tenn.\r\n\r\nNo need to ring the bell--the congregation are assembled, and armed guards\r\nare standing by lest someone should escape. Still a bell was tapped.\r\nSilence at once.\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" I said, \"when I was here before you kindly asked me to come and\r\nspeak to you again. I am here. Before I speak I want to have you sing.\r\nWill you sing?\" A moment’s pause, and in the rich tones which the colored\r\npeople so often have, there rang out from scores of throats, one of those\r\nweird songs of the race. It was of chariots and heaven, of songs and\r\npraises, and of Jesus the King. I cannot reproduce or describe it. I\r\nprayed for a blessing on our service, and several responded with\r\napparently as fervent \"Amen\" as ever came from Camp Meeting or Altar\r\nservice. Then I read passages, closing with a part of Romans 6: from the\r\ntwenty-third verse. I spoke briefly of \"The wages of sin, and of the gift\r\nof God.\" I almost fear I was harsh. Poor fellows--they were criminals, but\r\nwho is not guilty, before God, of violations of Divine law?\r\n\r\nAs I pleaded for the starting of a better life, as I spoke of their\r\nfamilies, as I said \"Some of you will be through with prison life soon,\"\r\nas I talked of honesty, sobriety, and purity, there were moist eyes. I\r\nasked for an expression at the close. All who will accept Jesus Christ,\r\nand from this very hour live for Him, and with the strength he gives try\r\nto forget the grievances you have thought to revenge; try to love and\r\nserve one another here, in Christ’s name, and others when released; strive\r\nto do your work faithfully; in short, try to do what you think Christ\r\nwould want you to do--first, give me your hand, and then kneel with me in\r\nprayer. Through the chinks and crevices of the stockade a score of men\r\nthrust their hands, eager to respond to the invitation, and many knelt in\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nHow much was make-believe? How much was genuine? The Searcher of hearts\r\nalone knows. Sowing by all waters, I am willing to leave results with God.\r\n\r\nAnother song, and then \"Good-bye, boss!\" \"Good-bye, Captain!\" \"Come again,\r\npreacher!\"\r\n\r\nThe days were weeks, and then! Criminal carelessness, perhaps. A premature\r\nexplosion of dynamite and powder combined on the railroad, and six of\r\nthese men had been discharged. Dead! A rough grave beside the track, God\r\nknows the rest. They were convicts, they were blacks, but they were my\r\nbrothers and yours, children of one Father.\r\n\r\nI was tired that Sunday, but I am glad God let me go and give them another\r\ninvitation to the Christ-life. Perhaps in some other time and place I\r\nshall talk over that service among the boys in black at Convict Camp, with\r\na soul in white over there. Who knows?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BRIGHT AND CANDID VIEW OF OUR MOUNTAIN WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter comes from a member of the \"Andover Band,\" three of\r\nwhom entered the work among the American Highlanders last year. It is the\r\nfirst band of theological students organized in any of our seminaries for\r\nwork in the field of the American Missionary Association. It was a very\r\ninteresting movement and worthy the seminary that has sent out bands into\r\nother parts of the country which have accomplished great results.\r\n\r\nThe testimony is set forth by Prof. John C. Campbell, a cultured young\r\nman, who looks on this interesting work with a fresh vision and gives\r\nopinions well balanced respecting this field and others.\r\n\r\nIt should be said that the letter was not written for publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year has been trying and wearing, but I take great satisfaction in\r\nknowing that much has been accomplished. We have established ourselves in\r\nthe hearts of the people, I believe, and have the respect and co-operative\r\ninterest of the best men in this and adjoining counties, so I hope for\r\ngreat things in the future if our friends in the North will only help us.\r\n\r\nSuspicion has given way to confidence, and I may even fire broadsides at\r\nthe tobacco habit now, even if it hits home. They are a trying, promising,\r\nand loveable people. I admire those of my classmates who have heard the\r\nvoice of God (not the prompting of inclination) calling them to remain in\r\ndear old hair-splitting New England; but, while I admire their bravery, I\r\nam sorry for them, for it must seem as if they were striking in the air.\r\nHere we see the enemy, and can strike directly at him, and one has some\r\nsatisfaction in getting weary and sick at heart in fighting at great odds\r\nagainst a visible power instead of the more subtle powers \"of the air.\"\r\nBut I digress! It is such a temptation to let myself out when\r\ncommunicating with one who understands this discouraging, fascinating, and\r\nencouraging work. This year’s work has given me experience, as well as\r\ngray hair, and even if my labors in the South should terminate this year,\r\nI should feel that I had gained a great deal. I wish that all Northerners\r\ncould come to know the best element of the South, and show their\r\nmagnanimity as victors by helping the American Missionary Association do\r\nthe work which alone will make a new South. To me the South presents a\r\ntouching but heroic picture as she struggles nobly, but somewhat\r\nuncertainly, toward the light, still the victim of her cavalier training,\r\nstill held back by the poor black and the poor white, the products of her\r\naccursed institution. Now that is all abolished, she needs help from the\r\nNorth. I doubt if we in the North would be any better had we been placed\r\nin the same environment, and our superiority may be due as much to soil,\r\nclimate, and the consequent unprofitableness of slave labor, as to our\r\nPuritan ancestry.\r\n\r\nThe tide of immigration is beginning to turn toward this State from\r\nGeorgia, and many coming from the Dakotas. The mass of ignorance is\r\nappalling. I realize in part, I think, the difficulty of getting the needs\r\nof the whites before a sympathizing audience. When it comes to a white\r\nman’s needs and his condition, too many church members and others\r\nsubstitute the scientific theory of the survival of the fittest for\r\nChrist’s law of love. They forget too, I fear, that many of these people\r\nin the mountains are victims of slavery as innocent as the Negro; and they\r\ndo not see that their indifference is letting them lie in the hard bed\r\nwhich circumstances, largely beyond their control, have made for them. If\r\nthey will only give us money, \"greenbacks,\" if need be, and enable us to\r\nget the young out of bed on their intellectual and spiritual feet, I shall\r\nbe satisfied. And if our Congressmen and politicians would bury the\r\n\"Bloody Shirt,\" and stop throwing stones over Mason and Dixon’s fence, and\r\nout of their personal means give, what is too often given uselessly, to\r\nthe Association and other similar Boards, the questions which spring from\r\nsectional prejudice would soon be solved. I do believe that what the\r\nAmerican Missionary Association stands for is the panacea for all\r\npolitical and social ills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIVALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLOTTE, N.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY REV. GEO. H HAINES.\r\n\r\nWe are in the midst of a glorious revival. Rev. James Wharton was with us\r\nsix days. What wonderful help he has been to our work during his stay with\r\nus. We had eleven hopeful conversions. We continued our meetings after he\r\nleft us, and our total number of conversions is twenty. Among the persons\r\nwho have left the ways of sin and turned into the way of life are two very\r\nremarkable cases. A woman of about fifty years of age, a drunkard and one\r\nof the most profane women in our city, asked the people of God to pray for\r\nher. It seemed hard for her to understand the simple plan of salvation,\r\nand that the Lord Jesus would save her if she would believe. The evening\r\nafter Mr. Wharton left she received the evidence of her conversion. I can\r\nnever tell how the news of this woman’s conversion spread over the city.\r\nIt created as much excitement as the news of the man who was found by our\r\nSaviour among the tombs. Crowds came to our services to see if the news\r\nwas true, and when they heard the testimony for Christ they rejoiced with\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe other is a man of about the same age, who has been a great disbeliever\r\nin the word of God, though his wife was a member of our church. He was a\r\nvery strong man in all the societies in the city. He has been led out of\r\ndarkness into light. The people say: \"God bless Mr. Wharton.\" Our\r\nSunday-school has grown wonderfully in the last month. Indeed, every\r\ndepartment of our church work is looking up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAUFORT, N.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY REV. J.P. SIMS.\r\n\r\nEvangelist Wharton’s visit did us a great deal of good. Not only have\r\nsouls been converted, but the church has been edified. In the revival\r\nthere were six hopeful conversions, and four joined our church, among them\r\na very promising young man.\r\n\r\nOur people are becoming more and more willing to divide their little mite\r\nwith the church. They make a special effort once a month to help raise the\r\npastor’s salary by giving what they call a \"surprise party,\" bringing\r\npackages of flour, sugar, coffee, meal, rice, fish, etc., for which I give\r\nthem credit. Sometimes the unconverted are with them. They come in\r\nsinging, fill the table, then a prayer, and return at once, singing as\r\nthey go. By this process we are able to send in a better report than we\r\nhave been doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL CHURCH, NEW ORLEANS, LA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY REV. JOHN W. WHITTAKER.\r\n\r\nWe have just passed through a precious season of revival. We began a\r\nseries of meetings during the week of prayer. God’s presence and blessing\r\nwere manifestly with us, so we were constrained to continue them another\r\nweek, holding meetings every night. Fifteen were turned to God. Nine of\r\nthem have united with our church and have begun service for the Master.\r\nThe meetings were well attended, and our whole church was stirred up to\r\nmore faithful work for God and humanity. Our church is steadily increasing\r\nin strength. Almost every Sabbath some one is taken into membership. We\r\nhave on our books nearly two hundred and fifty people who have pledged\r\nthemselves to give weekly on an average ten cents or more toward the\r\nsupport of the church. We love the American Missionary Association, and\r\nappreciate all that it is doing for us. We need its aid just now. We\r\ncannot get on without it. But we do not mean to make what you do for us an\r\nexcuse for doing less for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nITEMS FROM THE FIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nDENOMINATIONAL FRATERNITY.--From High Point, N. C., we have the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n    One of the great hindrances to the evangelization of the colored\r\n    people in the South is the constant flaunting of denominational\r\n    banners by ignorant and unprincipled preachers. But I am happy to\r\n    say, that at our special services on Lincoln Memorial Day, this\r\n    spirit of evil was buried in High Point, at least for one day. It\r\n    was pleasant to see Methodists, Baptists, and Congregationalists\r\n    working harmoniously together to make the occasion successful. One\r\n    brother and wife gave us 45 cents, and the pastor of the Baptist\r\n    Church, after speaking a word in behalf of the American Missionary\r\n    Association came forward and deposited a quarter on the table, at\r\n    the same time urging his members to give liberally to help it\r\n    overcome its great burden of debt. I am pleased also to note the\r\n    self-denial of two faithful members, a mother and daughter of our\r\n    own church, who out of their poverty gave 50 cents each. Both of\r\n    these good women are out in service, and although their earnings\r\n    are very small, they never give less than 25 cents each whenever\r\n    special efforts are made to raise money for the support of the\r\n    work.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRATEFUL REMEMBRANCES OF THE PAST.--Rev. James Brown, of Anniston, Ala.,\r\nrecalls some memories of the past:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When we met as a church on October 22, to pray for the success of\r\n    the American Missionary Association, it was touching to hear the\r\n    testimony of people from thirty-five to fifty years of age as to\r\n    the self-sacrificing spirit of the missionaries of the American\r\n    Missionary Association, as they came from Talladega to this\r\n    section more than twenty-five years ago. Some told how the\r\n    missionaries had to hide from place to place to keep out of the\r\n    reach of the Ku Klux, the speakers being almost eye-witnesses to\r\n    the murder of Mr. Luke, a few miles from this place. If some of\r\n    our Northern friends could have heard the words of gratitude for\r\n    the work of the American Missionary Association, and seen the\r\n    tears of joy over what has been accomplished, they would know that\r\n    their labors and gifts had not been in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERAL GIVING FROM A SMALL INCOME.--Rev. A. L. DeMond, of Lowell, N. C.,\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The people have had a heavy burden upon them during the hard times\r\n    of these winter months when there is so little for them to do in\r\n    the way of earning money. Of their little means they give freely\r\n    and gladly. Many of them are paid for their work in provisions at\r\n    the stores so that they do not receive much money. One poor woman\r\n    said to me: \"I can always give a little something because I get\r\n    _forty cents every week_ for my washing.\" She lives in a little\r\n    log cabin, through the sides of which the wind often whistles, but\r\n    every Sunday she gives something for the church of Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\nA POOR WOMAN’S FINE FEELING.--One day last year our laundress sent her\r\noldest boy, a lad fourteen years of age, on an errand. He was gone an hour\r\nor more longer than she expected him to be. Upon his return she asked him\r\nwhat he had been doing all that time. He told her that an expressman had\r\nbeen run away with, and had been quite badly hurt. He had helped get the\r\nman into a store, had gone for a doctor, and had done all that he could\r\nfor him. When he left him the man told him to go to his office the next\r\nday and he would give him something. The boy’s mother at once said that he\r\nmustn’t think of taking anything for what he had done for the man when he\r\nwas in trouble.\r\n\r\nWho can say that the colored people are incapable of fine feeling? This\r\npoor woman was certainly not so well provided with this world’s goods that\r\nshe had no use for money. On the contrary, she was a widow, with a family\r\nof five children that she had kept together and had sent to school at the\r\ncost of much sacrifice and years of hard work at the washtub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIVAL--LIBERAL CONTRIBUTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISS M. C. COLLINS, FORT YATES, N. DAK.\r\n\r\nI am sure you will be glad to hear of the great, may I say \"revival,\"\r\nwhich seems to be upon us. On March 1 at our regular communion we received\r\ninto the church fifteen adults, and there were eight marriages and nine\r\nchildren baptized. Six of these people came from Flying-By region (Miss\r\nLord’s people). She is rejoicing. One, Swift Cloud, and his wife, are a\r\nmiddle-aged couple, who lived here when I first came to this village. They\r\nare a good addition to our force. Then Two-Runs and his wife are two good\r\npeople, Miss Lord’s near neighbors, and will be a great help to her. The\r\nothers uniting came from my village, and we now have only two men and\r\ntheir wives in this village who are not in the church. Bird-Dog, another\r\nof Miss Lord’s people, and his wife and sister have given me their names\r\nas candidates for membership at the next communion. The Y. M. C. A. down\r\nthere are hauling logs to build a place to meet in. The little cabin we\r\nput up is already too small.\r\n\r\nOur contributions for Native Missionary work, from October 1 to March 1,\r\nall told, on Standing Rock Agency, are $206.47.\r\n\r\nWomen’s Missionary          $107.20\r\nSocieties have given\r\nY. M. C. A.                   57.99\r\nGrand River Church            21.78\r\nStanding Rock Church          19.50\r\nElkhorn (on Grand River),     45.65\r\nthe Women’s Society\r\nY. M. C. A.                   26.39\r\n\r\nBeside this our church here has given about $15 to the Lincoln Memorial\r\nFund for the Association and $10 to buy table and chairs for the pulpit.\r\nOur Christians are going from house to house to pray with the sick, and\r\nmany of these people are being brought to Christ through this means. On\r\ncommunion Sunday we opened the folding doors and yet the church was so\r\nfull that three of us sat down on the little platform behind the pulpit.\r\n\r\nI forgot to tell you that aside from this $206 we raised $200 to build a\r\nchapel at One Bull’s, where Elias was. The house is too little.\r\n\r\nWe are not \"lazy, good-for-nothing Indians, fit only for the soldiers’\r\ntarget.\" We are men and women struggling against clannishness and\r\nsuperstition--against evil without and within--reaching up to you who know\r\nthe blessedness of the Light of the Gospel, asking you to reach down, down\r\ninto our dark lives and lift us up. Let us get a glimpse on this side of\r\nthe beauties of Heaven.\r\n\r\nWe need your help, and bye and bye we will join your forces and help you\r\nto gather with God’s fold other tribes and nations who know not God. Do\r\nnot cut us down this spring. It will break our hearts with discouragement.\r\n\r\nGod help people to hear our prayer. We shake hands with God’s people in\r\nthe name of Jesus Christ our Saviour.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Three of the people outside the church in this village have given me\r\ntheir names as candidates for church membership at the May communion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROW AGENCY, MONTANA.--The growth of the missionary work among the Indians\r\nat the Crow Agency, Montana, is very encouraging. Recent reports from this\r\nfield bring information of large gatherings in the religious services, and\r\nin the church services and Sunday-school. Our missionary, Rev. J. G.\r\nBurgess, is planning to spend several weeks this summer among the camps on\r\nthe prairies to which the Indians withdraw during the warmer months. A\r\nchapel is very much needed at this mission in order to afford a place for\r\nreligious gatherings and such instruction as the missionary and his wife\r\nare able to give these Indians. This mission of the American Missionary\r\nAssociation is the only Protestant mission among the entire Crow tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OROVILLE MISSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY REV. W.C. POND, D.D.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: New Years Cake.]\r\n\r\n                             New Years Cake.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cake of which we give a picture is more than a monument to the\r\nartistic cookery of which some of our brethren there are capable. It was\r\nmade in a sort of Christian competition with the rude and senseless\r\noperations by which their idol-worshiping countrymen observed their great\r\nannual festival. And on Salvation Army principles, though not after their\r\nmethods, it called the attention of multitudes both of Chinese and\r\nAmericans to the Mission House and the Mission work and the Saviour for\r\nwhom our brethren were eager to bear witness. They did not confine their\r\nattention to cake-making nor express their loyalty to Christ in that way\r\nalone, but made up a very respectable sum, which, as \"New Year’s Gifts to\r\nJesus,\" they placed in our treasury.\r\n\r\nThe picture, as we are able to give it in our magazine, is not large\r\nenough to show all the points of interest about this cake. It represents,\r\nof course, a Chinese pagoda, but with the idols omitted. Possibly there is\r\nin it a little symbolism of _ascent_--the excelsior spirit which comes\r\nfrom new life in Christ. Beginning at the shell foundation, we see two\r\ncards which bear in Chinese an inscription literally translated thus:\r\n\"Eyes see; hands must not touch.\" Above this were the more abrupt or\r\npointed English words: \"Hands off.\" Over the door at the head of the steps\r\nis a framed inscription: \"Happy New Year, 1896.\" In what might be called\r\nthe second story there is another inscription, which, being interpreted,\r\nreads: \"Blessed News Chapel\"--_i.e._, Gospel Chapel--while on the right\r\npost are characters which, literally translated, mean: \"Blessed Land: good\r\ncultivating\"--_i.e._, to good cultivation this happy land yields large\r\nreturns. On the left-hand post the characters literally translated mean:\r\n\"News Chapel: righteous pastor: forms intimate friends\"--_i.e._, the\r\nrighteous pastor of this Gospel Chapel makes warm friends.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the cake are Chinese New Year’s lilies (narcissus)\r\ngrowing to perfection in saucers supplied with nothing except clean\r\npebbles and pure water--these are said to symbolize purity and mercy.\r\nAbove the lilies rise great clusters of artificial flowers, which also\r\nhave some symbolical import; I am unable to say what.\r\n\r\nThis will be a good place to say a few words about this mission, which has\r\nnow been in existence for more than twenty years. During all this period\r\nit has occupied, _rent free_, a small brick building belonging to our\r\nex-Governor and United States Senator, Hon. George C. Perkins, who began\r\nhis wonderfully successful career in this town of Oroville. He has not\r\neven required us to pay the taxes upon it, and when a rumor reached my\r\nears that his agent had received an offer for the purchase of it, Mr.\r\nPerkins kindly assured me that we should have the first chance to buy it,\r\nand he would help us out by a generous donation. That’s the sort of man he\r\nis.\r\n\r\nThere has always been a large Chinese population engaged mainly in mining,\r\nwhose headquarters were at Oroville. When our mission was established the\r\nnumber was estimated at not less than twenty-five hundred. Chinatown was\r\nquite extensive and all its frail structures swarmed, like bee-hives, with\r\ninhabitants. There are no such throngs now, but there are still people\r\nenough to call forth the most and the best that we can do for them.\r\n\r\nA large number of Chinese have here been turned from idol-worship to the\r\nlove of Jesus. I have at hand no means of scanning the long roll--reaching\r\nup to many hundreds--of those who have for longer or shorter periods been\r\nbrought here to know something of Christ. And the frequent change of\r\nteachers has rendered impossible any adequate statement of results. Among\r\nthose whom I specially remember are three Yongs: One, Yong Jim, an\r\nunusually well-educated man who, after being a missionary helper in\r\nseveral of our fields, returned to China, and has done gospel-work there\r\nin connection with the American Board; another, Yong Kay, was a delegate\r\nfrom California to the great convention of the Y. P. S. C. E. in Boston,\r\nand made several addresses there, which were well received. He is now\r\npreaching the Word in that city. Yet another of the same family has been\r\nfor several years a leader in Christian work among the Chinese in New\r\nYork. The Christians in California and elsewhere belonging to this family\r\nhave a little missionary work of their own among their relatives in China\r\nin addition to what they do through our Chinese Missionary Society. The\r\nwork at Oroville is now in excellent hands. We have a good\r\nhelper--intelligent, wise, steadfast--who almost wholly supports himself,\r\ndrawing but five dollars per month from our treasury, and giving back a\r\ngoodly portion of this. The teachers are faithful and earnest, and I\r\nrejoice to add that for several years our church in that town has\r\nrecognized its responsibility for this work, has given it the right hand\r\nof fellowship, and has aided it with generous gifts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJubilee Year Fund, Additional Shares.\r\n\r\n\r\nRev.
