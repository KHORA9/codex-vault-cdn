Therefore our\r\nnation is relying on its young men and young women; on the rising,\r\ninstructed generation, for the secure establishment of popular\r\nself-government in the Philippines. This was Rizal's own idea, for\r\nhe said, through the old philosopher in \"Noli me Tangere,\" that he\r\nwas not writing for his own generation but for a coming, instructed\r\ngeneration that would understand his hidden meaning.\r\n\r\nYour public school education gives you the democratic view-point,\r\nwhich the genius of Rizal gave him; in the fifty-five volumes of\r\nthe Blair-Robertson translation of Philippine historical material\r\nthere is available today more about your country's past than the\r\nentire contents of the British Museum afforded him; and you have the\r\nguidance in the new paths that Rizal struck out, of the life of a\r\nhero who, farsightedly or providentially, as you may later decide,\r\nwas the forerunner of the present regime.\r\n\r\nBut you will do as he would have done, neither accept anything because\r\nit is written, nor reject it because it does not fall in with your\r\nprejudices--study out the truth for yourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nIn writing a biography, the author, if he be discriminating, selects,\r\nwith great care, the salient features of the life story of the one whom\r\nhe deems worthy of being portrayed as a person possessed of preeminent\r\nqualities that make for a character and greatness. Indeed to write\r\nbiography at all, one should have that nice sense of proportion that\r\nmakes him instinctively seize upon only those points that do advance\r\nhis theme. Boswell has given the world an example of biography that\r\nis often wearisome in the extreme, although he wrote about a man\r\nwho occupied in his time a commanding position. Because Johnson was\r\nJohnson the world accepts Boswell, and loves to talk of the minuteness\r\nof Boswell's portrayal, yet how many read him, or if they do read him,\r\nhave the patience to read him to the end?\r\n\r\nIn writing the life of the greatest of the Filipinos, Mr. Craig has\r\ndisplayed judgment. Saturated as he is with endless details of Rizal's\r\nlife, he has had the good taste to select those incidents or those\r\nphases of Rizal's life that exhibit his greatness of soul and that\r\nshow the factors that were the most potent in shaping his character\r\nand in controlling his purposes and actions.\r\n\r\nA biography written with this chastening of wealth cannot fail to\r\nbe instructive and worthy of study. If one were to point out but\r\na single benefit that can accrue from a study of biography written\r\nas Mr. Craig has done that of Rizal, he would mention, I believe,\r\nthat to the character of the student, for one cannot study seriously\r\nabout men of character without being affected by that study. As\r\nleading to an understanding of the character of Rizal, Mr. Craig has\r\ndescribed his ancestry with considerable fulness and has shown how the\r\nselective principle has worked through successive generations. But\r\nhe has also realized the value of the outside influences and shows\r\nhow the accidents of birth and nation affected by environment plus\r\nmental vigor and will produced Jose Rizal. With a strikingly meager\r\nsetting of detail, Rizal has been portrayed from every side and the\r\nreader must leave the biography with a knowledge of the elements\r\nthat entered into and made his life. As a study for the youth of the\r\nPhilippines, I believe this life of Rizal will be productive of good\r\nresults. Stimulation and purpose are presented (yet not didactically)\r\nthroughout its pages. One object of the author, I should say, has been\r\nto show how both Philippine history and world history helped shape\r\nRizal's character. Accordingly, he has mentioned many historical\r\nmatters both of Philippine and world-wide interest. One cannot read\r\nthe book without a desire to know more of these matters. Thus the\r\nbook is not only a biography, it is a history as well. It must give\r\na larger outlook to the youth of the Philippines. The only drawback\r\nthat one might find in it, and it seems paradoxical to say it, is\r\nthe lack of more detail, for one leaves it wishing that he knew more\r\nof the actual intimate happenings, and this, I take it, is the best\r\neffect a biography can have on the reader outside of the instructive\r\nand moral value of the biography.\r\n\r\nJAMES A.

The blood\r\nwhich flowed in his veins must be traced generation by generation,\r\nthe better to understand the man, but at the same time the causes\r\nleading to the conditions of his times must be noted, step by step,\r\nin order to give a better understanding of the environment in which\r\nhe lived and labored.\r\n\r\nThe study of the growth of free ideas is now in the days of our\r\ndemocracy the most important feature of Philippine history; hitherto\r\nthis history has consisted of little more than lists of governors,\r\ntheir term of office, and of the recital of such incidents as were\r\nconsidered to redound to the glory of Spain, or could be so twisted\r\nand misrepresented as to make them appear to do so. It rarely occurred\r\nto former historians that the lamp of experience might prove a light\r\nfor the feet of future generations, and the mistakes of the past\r\nwere usually ignored or passed over, thus leaving the way open for\r\nrepeating the old errors. But profit, not pride, should be the object\r\nof the study of the past, and our historians of today very largely\r\nconcern themselves with mistakes in policy and defects of system;\r\nfortunately for them such critical investigation under our changed\r\nconditions does not involve the discomfort and danger that attended\r\nit in the days of Doctor Rizal.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the martyred Doctor, criticism of the right\r\nsort--even the very best things may be abused till they become\r\nintolerable evils--serves much the same useful warning purpose\r\nfor governments that the symptoms of sickness do for persons. Thus\r\ngovernment and individual alike, when advised in time of something\r\nwrong with the system, can seek out and correct the cause before\r\nserious consequences ensue. But the nation that represses honest\r\ncriticism with severity, like the individual who deadens his symptoms\r\nwith dangerous drugs, is likely to be lulled into a false security\r\nthat may prove fatal. Patriot toward Spain and the Philippines alike,\r\nRizal tried to impress this view upon the government of his day,\r\nwith fatal results to himself, and the disastrous effects of not\r\nheeding him have since justified his position.\r\n\r\nThe very defenses of Old Manila illustrate how the Philippines have\r\nsuffered from lack of such devoted, honest and courageous critics as\r\nJose Rizal. The city wall was built some years later than the first\r\nSpanish occupation to keep out Chinese pirates after Li Ma-hong\r\ndestroyed the city. The Spaniards sheltered themselves in the old\r\nTagalog fort till reenforcements could come from the country. No one\r\nhad ever dared to quote the proverb about locking the door after the\r\nhorse was stolen. The need for the moat, so recently filled in, was\r\nnot seen until after the bitter experience of the easy occupation of\r\nManila by the English, but if public opinion had been allowed free\r\nexpression this experience might have been avoided. And the free\r\nspace about the walls was cleared of buildings only after these same\r\nbuildings had helped to make the same occupation of the city easier,\r\nyet there were many in Manila who foresaw the danger but feared to\r\nforetell it.\r\n\r\nHad the people of Spain been free to criticise the Spaniards' way of\r\nwaiting to do things until it is too late, that nation, at one time the\r\nlargest and richest empire in the world, would probably have been saved\r\nfrom its loss of territory and its present impoverished condition. And\r\nhad the early Filipinos, to whom splendid professions and sweeping\r\npromises were made, dared to complain of the Peninsular policy of\r\nprocrastination--the \"manana\" habit, as it has been called--Spain\r\nmight have been spared Doctor Rizal's terrible but true indictment\r\nthat she retarded Philippine progress, kept the Islands miserably\r\nruled for 333 years and in the last days of the nineteenth century was\r\nstill permitting mediaeval malpractices. Rizal did not believe that\r\nhis country was able to stand alone as a separate government. He\r\ntherefore desired to preserve the Spanish sovereignty in the\r\nPhilippines, but he desired also to bring about reforms and conditions\r\nconducive to advancement. To this end he carefully pointed out those\r\ncolonial shortcomings that caused friction, kept up discontent, and\r\nprevented safe progress, and that would have been perfectly easy to\r\ncorrect. Directly as well as indirectly, the changes he proposed were\r\ncalculated to benefit the homeland quite as much as the Philippines,\r\nbut his well-meaning efforts brought him hatred and an undeserved\r\ndeath, thus proving once more how thankless is the task of telling\r\nunpleasant truths, no matter how necessary it may be to do so. Because\r\nRizal spoke out boldly, while realizing what would probably be his\r\nfate, history holds him a hero and calls his death a martyrdom. He\r\nwas not one of those popularity-seeking, self-styled patriots who are\r\never mouthing \"My country, right or wrong;\" his devotion was deeper\r\nand more disinterested. When he found his country wrong he willingly\r\nsacrificed himself to set her right. Such unselfish spirits are rare;\r\nin life they are often misunderstood, but when time does them justice,\r\nthey come into a fame which endures.\r\n\r\nDoctor Rizal knew that the real Spain had generous though sluggish\r\nintentions, and noble though erratic impulses, but it awoke too late;\r\ntoo late for Doctor Rizal and too late to save the Philippines for\r\nSpain; tardy reforms after his death were useless and the loss of\r\nher overseas possessions was the result. Doctor Rizal lost when he\r\nstaked his life on his trust in the innate sense of honor of Spain,\r\nfor that sense of honor became temporarily blinded by a sudden but\r\nfatal gust of passion; and it took the shock of the separation to\r\nrouse the dormant Spanish chivalry.\r\n\r\nStill in the main Rizal's judgment was correct, and he was the victim\r\nof mistimed, rather than of misplaced, confidence, for as soon as\r\nthe knowledge of the real Rizal became known to the Spanish people,\r\nbelated justice began to be done his memory, and then, repentant and\r\nremorseful, as is characteristically Castilian, there was little delay\r\nand no half-heartedness. Another name may now be grouped with Columbus\r\nand Cervantes among those to whom Spain has given imprisonment in\r\nlife and monuments after death--chains for the man and chaplets for\r\nhis memory. In 1896, during the few days before he could be returned\r\nto Manila, Doctor Rizal occupied a dungeon in Montjuich Castle in\r\nBarcelona; while on his way to assist the Spanish soldiers in Cuba\r\nwho were stricken with yellow fever, he was shipped and sent back to\r\na prejudged trial and an unjust execution. Fifteen years later the\r\nCatalan city authorities commemorated the semi-centennial of this\r\nprisoner's birth by changing, in his honor, the name of a street in\r\nthe shadow of the infamous prison of Montjuich Castle to \"Calle del\r\nDoctor Rizal.\"\r\n\r\nMore instances of this nature are not cited since they are not\r\nessential to the proper understanding of Rizal's story, but let it be\r\nmade clear once for all that whatever harshness may be found in the\r\nfollowing pages is directed solely to those who betrayed the trust\r\nof the mother country and selfishly abused the ample and unrestrained\r\npowers with which Spain invested them.\r\n\r\nAnd what may seem the exaltation of the Anglo-Saxons at the expense of\r\nthe Latins in these pages is intended only to point out the superiority\r\nof their ordered system of government, with its checks and balances,\r\nits individual rights and individual duties, under which men are\r\n\"free to live by no man's leave, underneath the Law.\" No human being\r\ncan be safely trusted with unlimited power, and no man, no matter\r\nwhat his nationality, could have withstood the temptations offered by\r\nthe chaotic conditions in the Philippines in past times any better\r\nthan did the Spaniards. There is nothing written in this book that\r\nshould convey the opinion that in similar circumstances men of any\r\nnationality would not have acted as the Spaniards did. The easiest\r\nrecognized characteristic of absolutism, and all the abuses and\r\ncorruption it brings in its train, is fear of criticism, and Spain\r\ndrew her own indictment in the Philippines when she executed Rizal.\r\n\r\nWhen any nation sets out to enroll all its scholarly critics among\r\nthe martyrs in the cause of Liberty, it makes an open confession of\r\nguilt to all the world. For a quarter of a century Spain had been\r\nruling in the Philippines by terrorizing its subjects there, and\r\nRizal's execution, with utter disregard of the most elementary rules\r\nof judicial procedure, was the culmination that drove the Filipinos\r\nto desperation and arrested the attention of the whole civilized\r\nworld. It was evident that Rizal's fate might have been that of any\r\nof his countrymen, and the thinking world saw that events had taken\r\nsuch a course in the Philippines that it had become justifiable for\r\nthe Filipinos to attempt to dissolve the political bands which had\r\nconnected them with Spain for over three centuries.\r\n\r\nSuch action by the Filipinos would not have been warranted by a\r\nsolitary instance of unjust execution under stress of political\r\nexcitement that did not indicate the existence of a settled\r\npolicy. Such instances are rather to be classed among the mistakes\r\nto which governments as well as individuals are liable. Yet even such\r\na mistake may be avoided by certain precautions which experience has\r\nsuggested, and the nation that disregards these precautions is justly\r\nopen to criticism.\r\n\r\nOur present Philippine government guarantees to its citizens as\r\nfundamental rights, that no person shall be held to answer for a\r\ncapital crime unless on an indictment, nor may he be compelled in any\r\ncriminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life,\r\nliberty or property without due process of law. The accused must have\r\na speedy, public and impartial trial, be informed of the nature and\r\ncause of the accusation, be confronted with the witnesses against him,\r\nhave compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and have\r\nthe assistance of counsel for his defense. Not one of these safeguards\r\nprotected Doctor Rizal except that he had an \"open trial,\" if that name\r\nmay be given to a courtroom filled with his enemies openly clamoring\r\nfor his death without rebuke from the court. Even the presumption of\r\ninnocence till guilt was established was denied him. These precautions\r\nhave been considered necessary for every criminal trial, but the\r\nframers of the American Constitution, fearful lest popular prejudice\r\nsome day might cause injustice to those advocating unpopular ideals,\r\nprohibited the irremediable penalty of death upon a charge of treason\r\nexcept where the testimony of two reliable witnesses established some\r\novert act, inference not being admissible as evidence.\r\n\r\nSuch protection was not given the subjects of Spain, but still, with\r\nall the laxity of the Spanish law, and even if all the charges had been\r\ntrue, which they were far from being, no case was made out against\r\nDoctor Rizal at his trial. According to the laws then in effect, he\r\nwas unfairly convicted and he should be considered innocent; for this\r\nreason his life will be studied to see what kind of hero he was, and\r\nno attempt need be made to plead good character and honest intentions\r\nin extenuation of illegal acts. Rizal was ever the advocate of law,\r\nand it will be found, too, that he was always consistently law-abiding.\r\n\r\nThough they are in the Orient, the Filipinos are not of it. Rizal once\r\nsaid, upon hearing of plans for a Philippine exhibit at a European\r\nWorld's Fair, that the people of Europe would have a chance to see\r\nthemselves as they were in the Middle Ages. With allowances for the\r\nchanges due to climate and for the character of the country, this\r\nstatement can hardly be called exaggerated. The Filipinos in the\r\nlast half of the nineteenth century were not Orientals but mediaeval\r\nEuropeans--to the credit of the early Castilians but to the discredit\r\nof the later Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos of the remoter Christian barrios, whom Rizal had in mind\r\nparticularly, were in customs, beliefs and advancement substantially\r\nwhat the descendants of Legaspi's followers might have been had these\r\nbeen shipwrecked on the sparsely inhabited islands of the Archipelago\r\nand had their settlement remained shut off from the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nExcept where foreign influence had accidentally crept in at the\r\nports, it could truthfully be said that scarcely perceptible advance\r\nhad been made in three hundred years. Succeeding Spaniards by their\r\nmisrule not only added little to the glorious achievement of their\r\nancestors, but seemed to have prevented the natural progress which\r\nthe land would have made.\r\n\r\nIn one form or another, this contention was the basis of Rizal's\r\ncampaign. By careful search, it is true, isolated instances of\r\nimprovement could be found, but the showing at its very best was\r\nso pitifully poor that the system stood discredited. And it was the\r\nsystem to which Rizal was opposed.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards who engaged in public argument with Rizal were\r\ncontinually discovering, too late to avoid tumbling into them, logical\r\npitfalls which had been carefully prepared to trap them. Rizal argued\r\nmuch as he played chess, and was ever ready to sacrifice a pawn to\r\nbe enabled to say \"check.\" Many an unwary opponent realized after\r\nhe had published what he had considered a clever answer that the\r\nsame reasoning which scored a point against Rizal incontrovertibly\r\nestablished the Kalamban's major premise.\r\n\r\nSuperficial antagonists, to the detriment of their own reputations,\r\nhave made much of what they chose to consider Rizal's historical\r\nerrors. But history is not merely chronology, and his representation\r\nof its trend, disregarding details, was a masterly tracing of current\r\nevils to their remote causes. He may have erred in some of his minor\r\nstatements; this will happen to anyone who writes much, but attempts to\r\ndiscredit Rizal on the score of historical inaccuracy really reflect\r\nupon the captious critics, just as a draftsman would expose himself\r\nto ridicule were he to complain of some famous historical painting\r\nthat it had not been drawn to exact scale. Rizal's writings were\r\nintended to bring out in relief the evils of the Spanish system of\r\nthe government of the Filipino people, just as a map of the world\r\nmay put the inhabited portions of the earth in greater prominence\r\nthan those portions that are not inhabited. Neither is exact in its\r\nrepresentation, but each serves its purpose the better because it\r\nmagnifies the important and minimizes the unimportant.\r\n\r\nIn his disunited and abased countrymen, Rizal's writings aroused, as he\r\nintended they should, the spirit of nationality, of a Fatherland which\r\nwas not Spain, and put their feet on the road to progress. What matters\r\nit, then, if his historical references are not always exhaustive, and\r\nif to make himself intelligible in the Philippines he had to write in\r\na style possibly not always sanctioned by the Spanish Academy? Spain\r\nherself had denied to the Filipinos a system of education that\r\nmight have made a creditable Castilian the common language of the\r\nArchipelago. A display of erudition alone does not make an historian,\r\nnor is purity, propriety and precision in choosing words all there\r\nis to literature.\r\n\r\nRizal charged Spain unceasingly with unprogressiveness in the\r\nPhilippines, just as he labored and planned unwearyingly to bring\r\nthe Filipinos abreast of modern European civilization. But in his\r\nappeals to the Spanish conscience and in his endeavors to educate his\r\ncountrymen he showed himself as practical as he was in his arguments,\r\never ready to concede nonessentials in name and means if by doing so\r\nprogress could be made.\r\n\r\nBecause of his unceasing efforts for a wiser, better governed and\r\nmore prosperous Philippines, and because of his frank admission that\r\nhe hoped thus in time there might come a freer Philippines, Rizal was\r\ncalled traitor to Spain and ingrate. Now honest, open criticism is\r\nnot treason, and the sincerest gratitude to those who first brought\r\nChristian civilization to the Philippines should not shut the eyes to\r\nthe wrongs which Filipinos suffered from their successors. But until\r\nthe latest moment of Spanish rule, the apologists of Spain seemed to\r\nthink that they ought to be able to turn away the wrath evoked by the\r\ncruelty and incompetence that ran riot during centuries, by dwelling\r\nupon the benefits of the early days of the Spanish dominion.\r\n\r\nWearisome was the eternal harping on gratitude which at one time was\r\nthe only safe tone for pulpit, press and public speech; it irritating\r\nbecause it ignored questions of current policy, and it was discouraging\r\nto the Filipinos who were reminded by it of the hopeless future for\r\ntheir country to which time had brought no progress. But with all the\r\nfaults and unworthiness of the later rulers, and the inane attempts\r\nof their parasites to distract attention from these failings, there\r\nremains undimmed the luster of Spain's early fame. The Christianizing\r\nwhich accompanied her flag upon the mainland and islands of the\r\nNew World is its imperishable glory, and the transformation of the\r\nFilipino people from Orientals into mediaeval Europeans through the\r\ncolonizing genius of the early Castilians, remains a marvel unmatched\r\nin colonial history and merits the lasting gratitude of the Filipino.\r\n\r\nDoctor Rizal satirized the degenerate descendants and scored the\r\nunworthy successors, but his writings may be searched in vain for\r\nwholesale charges against the Spanish nation such as Spanish scribblers\r\nwere forever directing against all Filipinos, past, present and future,\r\nwith an alleged fault of a single one as a pretext. It will be found\r\nthat he invariably recognized that the faithful first administrators\r\nand the devoted pioneer missionaries had a valid claim upon the\r\ncontinuing gratitude of the people of Tupa's and Lakandola's land.\r\n\r\nRizal's insight discerned, and experience has demonstrated, that\r\nLegaspi, Urdaneta and those who were like them, laid broad and firm\r\nfoundations for a modern social and political organization which\r\ncould be safely and speedily established by reforms from above. The\r\nearly Christianizing civilizers deserve no part of the blame for\r\nthe fact that Philippine ports were not earlier opened to progress,\r\nbut much credit is due them that there is succeeding here an orderly\r\ndemocracy such as now would be impossible in any neighboring country.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine patriot would be the first to recognize the justice\r\nof the selection of portraits which appear with that of Rizal upon\r\nthe present Philippine postage stamps, where they serve as daily\r\nreminders of how free government came here.\r\n\r\nThe constancy and courage of a Portuguese sailor put these Islands into\r\ntouch with the New World with which their future progress was to be\r\nidentified. The tact and honesty of a civil official from Mexico made\r\npossible the almost bloodless conquest which brought the Filipinos\r\nunder the then helpful rule of Spain. The bequest of a far-sighted\r\nearly philanthropist was the beginning of the water system of Manila,\r\nwhich was a recognition of the importance of efforts toward improving\r\nthe public health and remains a reminder of how, even in the darkest\r\ndays of miseries and misgovernment, there have not been wanting\r\nSpaniards whose ideal of Spanish patriotism was to devote heart,\r\nbrain and wealth to the welfare of the Filipinos. These were the\r\nheroes of the period of preparation.\r\n\r\nThe life of the one whose story is told in these pages was devoted\r\nand finally sacrificed to dignify their common country in the eyes\r\nof his countrymen, and to unite them in a common patriotism; he\r\ninculcated that self-respect which, by leading to self-restraint and\r\nself-control, makes self-government possible; and sought to inspire\r\nin all a love of ordered freedom, so that, whether under the flag\r\nof Spain or any other, or by themselves, neither tyrants (caciques)\r\nnor slaves (those led by caciques) would be possible among them.\r\n\r\nAnd the change itself came through an American President who\r\nbelieved, and practiced the belief, that nations owed obligations\r\nto other nations just as men had duties toward their fellow-men. He\r\nestablished here Liberty through Law, and provided for progress in\r\ngeneral education, which should be a safeguard to good government as\r\nwell, for an enlightened people cannot be an oppressed people. Then\r\nhe went to war against the Philippines rather than deceive them,\r\nbecause the Filipinos, who repeatedly had been tricked by Spain with\r\nunfulfilled promises, insisted on pledges which he had not the power to\r\ngive. They knew nothing of what was meant by the rule of the people,\r\nand could not conceive of a government whose head was the servant\r\nand not the master. Nor did they realize that even the voters might\r\nnot promise for the future, since republicanism requires that the\r\ngovernment of any period shall rule only during the period that it\r\nis in the majority. In that war military glory and quick conquest\r\nwere sacrificed to consideration for the misled enemy, and every\r\neffort was made to minimize the evils of warfare and to gain the\r\nconfidence of the people. Retaliation for violations of the usages of\r\ncivilized warfare, of which Filipinos at first were guilty through\r\ntheir Spanish training, could not be entirely prevented, but this\r\nretaliation contrasted strikingly with the Filipinos' unhappy past\r\nexperiences with Spanish soldiers. The few who had been educated out\r\nof Spain and therefore understood the American position were daily\r\nreenforced by those persons who became convinced from what they saw,\r\nuntil a majority of the Philippine people sought peace. Then the\r\nPresident of the United States outlined a policy, and the history\r\nand constitution of his government was an assurance that this policy\r\nwould be followed; the American government then began to do what it\r\nhad not been able to promise.\r\n\r\nThe forerunner and the founder of the present regime in these Islands,\r\nby a strange coincidence, were as alike in being cruelly misunderstood\r\nin their lifetimes by those whom they sought to benefit as they were\r\nin the tragedy of their deaths, and both were unjustly judged by many,\r\nprobably well-meaning, countrymen.\r\n\r\nMagellan, Legaspi, Carriedo, Rizal and McKinley, heroes of the free\r\nPhilippines, belonged to different times and were of different types,\r\nbut their work combined to make possible the growing democracy of\r\nto-day. The diversity of nationalities among these heroes is an added\r\nadvantage, for it recalls that mingling of blood which has developed\r\nthe Filipinos into a strong people.\r\n\r\nEngland, the United States and the Philippines are each composed\r\nof widely diverse elements. They have each been developed by\r\nadversity. They have each honored their severest critics while yet\r\nthose critics lived. Their common literature, which tells the story\r\nof human liberty in its own tongue, is the richest, most practical\r\nand most accessible of all literature, and the popular education upon\r\nwhich rests the freedom of all three is in the same democratic tongue,\r\nwhich is the most widely known of civilized languages and the only\r\nunsycophantic speech, for it stands alone in not distinguishing by\r\nits use of pronouns in the second person the social grade of the\r\nindividual addressed.\r\n\r\nThe future may well realize Rizal's dream that his country should\r\nbe to Asia what England has been to Europe and the United States\r\nis in America, a hope the more likely to be fulfilled since the\r\nevents of 1898 restored only associations of the earlier and happier\r\ndays of the history of the Philippines. The very name now used is\r\nnearer the spelling of the original Philipinas than the Filipinas\r\nof nineteenth century Spanish usage. The first form was used until\r\nnearly a century ago, when it was corrupted along with so many things\r\nof greater importance.\r\n\r\nThe Philippines at first were called \"The Islands of the West,\" as\r\nthey are considered to be occidental and not oriental. They were made\r\nknown to Europe as a sequel to the discoveries of Columbus. Conquered\r\nand colonized from Mexico, most of their pious and charitable\r\nendowments, churches, hospitals, asylums and colleges, were endowed\r\nby philanthropic Mexicans. Almost as long as Mexico remained Spanish\r\nthe commerce of the Philippines was confined to Mexico, and the\r\nPhilippines were a part of the postal system of Mexico and dependent\r\nupon the government of Mexico exactly as long as Mexico remained\r\nSpanish. They even kept the new world day, one day behind Europe,\r\nfor a third of a century longer. The Mexican dollars continued to be\r\ntheir chief coins till supplanted, recently, by the present peso,\r\nand the highbuttoned white coat, the \"americana,\" by that name was\r\nin general use long years ago. The name America is frequently to be\r\nfound in the old baptismal registers, for a century or more ago many\r\na Filipino child was so christened, and in the '70's Rizal's carving\r\ninstructor, because so many of the best-made articles he used were\r\nof American manufacture, gave the name \"Americano\" to a godchild. As\r\nAmericans, Filipinos were joined with the Mexicans when King Ferdinand\r\nVII thanked his subjects in both countries for their loyalty during\r\nthe Napoleonic wars. Filipino students abroad found, too, books about\r\nthe Philippines listed in libraries and in booksellers' catalogues\r\nas a branch of \"Americana.\"\r\n\r\nNor was their acquaintance confined to Spanish Americans. The name\r\n\"English\" was early known. Perhaps no other was more familiar in\r\nthe beginning, for it was constantly execrated by the Spaniards,\r\nand in consequence secretly cherished by those who suffered wrongs\r\nat their hands.\r\n\r\nMagellan had lost his life in his attempted circumnavigation of the\r\nglobe and Elcano completed the disastrous voyage in a shattered ship,\r\nminus most of its crew. But Drake, an Englishman, undertook the same\r\nvoyage, passed the Straits in less time than Magellan, and was the\r\nfirst commander in his own ship to put a belt around the earth. These\r\nfacts were known in the Philippines, and from them the Filipinos drew\r\ncomparisons unfavorable to the boastful Spaniards.\r\n\r\nWhen the rich Philippine galleon Santa Ana was captured off the\r\nCalifornia coast by Thomas Candish, \"three boys born in Manila\"\r\nwere taken on board the English ships. Afterwards Candish sailed into\r\nthe straits south of \"Lucon\" and made friends with the people of the\r\ncountry. There the Filipinos promised \"both themselves, and all the\r\nislands thereabouts, to aid him whensoever he should come again to\r\novercome the Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\nDampier, another English sea captain, passed through the Archipelago\r\nbut little later, and one of his men, John Fitzgerald by name, remained\r\nin the Islands, marrying here. He pretended to be a physician, and\r\npracticed as a doctor in Manila. There was no doubt room for him,\r\nbecause when Spain expelled the Moors she reduced medicine in her\r\ncountry to a very low state, for the Moors had been her most skilled\r\nphysicians. Many of these Moors who were Christians, though not\r\northodox according to the Spanish standard, settled in London, and\r\nthe English thus profited by the persecution, just as she profited\r\nwhen the cutlery industry was in like manner transplanted from Toledo\r\nto Sheffield.\r\n\r\nThe great Armada against England in Queen Elizabeth's time was an\r\nattempt to stop once for all the depredations of her subjects on\r\nSpain's commerce in the Orient. As the early Spanish historian, Morga,\r\nwrote of it: \"Then only the English nation disturbed the Spanish\r\ndominion in that Orient. Consequently King Philip desired not only\r\nto forbid it with arms near at hand, but also to furnish an example,\r\nby their punishment, to all the northern nations, so that they should\r\nnot undertake the invasions that we see. A beginning was made in this\r\nwork in the year one thousand five hundred and eighty-eight.\"\r\n\r\nThis ingeniously worded statement omits to tell how ignominiously\r\nthe pretentious expedition ended, but the fact of failure remained\r\nand did not help the prestige of Spain, especially among her subjects\r\nin the Far East. After all the boastings of what was going to happen,\r\nand all the claims of what had been accomplished, the enemies of Spain\r\nnot only were unchecked but appeared to be bolder than ever. Some of\r\nthe more thoughtful Filipinos then began to lose confidence in Spanish\r\nclaims. They were only a few, but their numbers were to increase as\r\nthe years went by. The Spanish Armada was one of the earliest of those\r\ninfluences which, reenforced by later events, culminated in the life\r\nwork of Jose Rizal and the loss of the Philippines by Spain.\r\n\r\nAt that time the commerce of Manila was restricted to the galleon\r\ntrade with Mexico, and the prosperity of the Filipino merchants--in\r\nlarge measure the prosperity of the entire Archipelago--depended\r\nupon the yearly ventures the hazard of which was not so much the\r\nordinary uncertainty of the sea as the risk of capture by English\r\nfreebooters. Everybody in the Philippines had heard of these daring\r\nEnglish mariners, who were emboldened by an almost unbroken series of\r\nsuccesses which had correspondingly discouraged the Spaniards. They\r\ncarried on unceasing war despite occasional proclamation of peace\r\nbetween England and Spain, for the Spanish treasure ships were\r\ntempting prizes, and though at times policy made their government\r\ndesire friendly relations with Spain, the English people regarded\r\nall Spaniards as their natural enemies and all Spanish property as\r\ntheir legitimate spoil.\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos realized earlier than the Spaniards did that torturing to\r\ndeath shipwrecked English sailors was bad policy. The result was always\r\nto make other English sailors fight more desperately to avoid a similar\r\nfate. Revenge made them more and more aggressive, and treaties made\r\nwith Spain were disregarded because, as they said, Spain's inhumanity\r\nhad forfeited her right to be considered a civilized country.\r\n\r\nIt was less publicly discussed, but equally well known, that the\r\nEnglish freebooters, besides committing countless depredations\r\non commerce, were always ready to lend their assistance to any\r\ndiscontented Spanish subjects whom they could encourage into open\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nThe English word Filibuster was changed into \"Filibusteros\" by the\r\nSpanish, and in later years it came to be applied especially to those\r\ncharged with stirring up discontent and rebellion. For three centuries,\r\nin its early application to the losses of commerce, and in its later\r\nuse as denoting political agitation, possibly no other word in the\r\nPhilippines, outside of the ordinary expressions of daily life, was\r\nso widely known, and certainly none had such sinister signification.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this lawless association is a similarity of laws. The\r\nfollowers of Cortez, it will be remembered, were welcomed in Mexico\r\nas the long-expected \"Fair Gods\" because of their blond complexions\r\nderived from a Gothic ancestry. Far back in history their forbears\r\nhad been neighbors of the Anglo-Saxons in the forests of Germany,\r\nso that the customs of Anglo-Saxon England and of the Gothic\r\nkingdom of Castile had much in common. The \"Laws of the Indies,\"\r\nthe disregard of which was the ground of most Filipino complaints\r\nup to the very last days of the rule of Spain, was a compilation\r\nof such of these Anglo-Saxon-Castilian laws and customs as it was\r\nthought could be extended to the Americas, originally called the New\r\nKingdom of Castile, which included the Philippine Archipelago. Thus\r\nthe New England township and the Mexican, and consequently the early\r\nPhilippine pueblo, as units of local government are nearly related.\r\n\r\nThese American associations, English influences, and Anglo-Saxon ideals\r\nalso culminated in the life work of Jose Rizal, the heir of all the\r\npast ages in Philippine history. But other causes operating in his\r\nown day--the stories of his elders, the incidents of his childhood,\r\nthe books he read, the men he met, the travels he made--as later\r\npages will show--contributed further to make him the man he was.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for the Philippines that after the war of\r\nmisunderstanding with the United States there existed a character that\r\ncommanded the admiration of both sides. Rizal's writings revealed to\r\nthe Americans aspirations that appealed to them and conditions that\r\ncalled forth their sympathy, while the Filipinos felt confidence,\r\nfor that reason, in the otherwise incomprehensible new government\r\nwhich honored their hero.\r\n\r\nRizal was already, and had been for years, without rival as the idol\r\nof his countrymen when there came, after deliberation and delay, his\r\nofficial recognition in the Philippines. Necessarily there had to be\r\ncareful study of his life and scrutiny of his writings before the head\r\nof our nation could indorse as the corner stone of the new government\r\nwhich succeeded Spain's misrule, the very ideas which Spain had\r\nconsidered a sufficient warrant for shooting their author as a traitor.\r\n\r\nFinally the President of the United States in a public address at\r\nFargo, North Dakota, on April 7, 1903--five years after American\r\nscholars had begun to study Philippine affairs as they had never\r\nbeen studied before--declared: \"In the Philippine Islands the\r\nAmerican government has tried, and is trying, to carry out exactly\r\nwhat the greatest genius and most revered patriot ever known in the\r\nPhilippines, Jose Rizal, steadfastly advocated,\" a formal, emphatic\r\nand clear-cut expression of national policy upon a question then of\r\nparamount interest.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the facts of Philippine history already set forth\r\nthere is no cause for wonder at this sweeping indorsement, even\r\nthough the views so indorsed were those of a man who lived in\r\nconditions widely different from those about to be introduced by\r\nthe new government. Rizal had not allowed bias to influence him in\r\nstudying the past history of the Philippines, he had been equally\r\nhonest with himself in judging the conditions of his own time, and\r\nhe knew and applied with the same fairness the teaching which holds\r\ntrue in history as in every other branch of science that like causes\r\nunder like conditions must produce like results, He had been careful in\r\nhis reasoning, and it stood the test, first of President Roosevelt's\r\nadvisers, or otherwise that Fargo speech would never have been made,\r\nand then of all the President's critics, or there would have been\r\nheard more of the statement quoted above which passed unchallenged,\r\nbut not, one may be sure, uninvestigated.\r\n\r\nThe American system is in reality not foreign to the Philippines,\r\nbut it is the highest development, perfected by experience, of the\r\noriginal plan under which the Philippines had prospered and progressed\r\nuntil its benefits were wrongfully withheld from them. Filipino\r\nleaders had been vainly asking Spain for the restoration of their\r\nrights and the return to the system of the Laws of the Indies. At the\r\ntime when America came to the Islands there was among them no Rizal,\r\nwith a knowledge of history that would enable him to recognize that\r\nthey were getting what they had been wanting, who could rise superior\r\nto the unimportant detail of under what name or how the good came as\r\nlong as it arrived, and whose prestige would have led his countrymen to\r\naccept his decision. Some leaders had one qualification, some another,\r\na few combined two, but none had the three, for a country is seldom\r\nfavored with more than one surpassingly great man at one time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nRizal's Chinese Ancestry\r\n\r\nClustered around the walls of Manila in the latter half of the\r\nseventeenth century were little villages the names of which, in some\r\ninstances slightly changed, are the names of present districts. A\r\nfashionable drive then was through the settlement of Filipinos in\r\nBagumbayan--the \"new town\" to which Lakandola's subjects had migrated\r\nwhen Legaspi dispossessed them of their own \"Maynila.\" With the\r\nbuilding of the moat this village disappeared, but the name remained,\r\nand it is often used to denote the older Luneta, as well as the drive\r\nleading to it.\r\n\r\nWithin the walls lived the Spanish rulers and the few other persons\r\nthat the fear and jealousy of the Spaniard allowed to come in. Some\r\nwere Filipinos who ministered to the needs of the Spaniards, but the\r\ngreater number were Sangleyes, or Chinese, \"the mechanics in all trades\r\nand excellent workmen,\" as an old Spanish chronicle says, continuing:\r\n\"It is true that the city could not be maintained or preserved without\r\nthe Sangleyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chinese conditions of these early days are worth recalling, for\r\ninfluences strikingly similar to those which affected the life of Jose\r\nRizal in his native land were then at work. There were troubled times\r\nin the ancient \"Middle Kingdom,\" the earlier name of the corruption\r\nof the Malay Tchina (China) by which we know it. The conquering\r\nManchus had placed their emperor on the throne so long occupied by\r\nthe native dynasty whose adherents had boastingly called themselves\r\n\"The Sons of Light.\" The former liberal and progressive government,\r\nunder which the people prospered, had grown corrupt and helpless,\r\nand the country had yielded to the invaders and passed under the\r\nterrible tyranny of the Tartars.\r\n\r\nYet there were true patriots among the Chinese who were neither\r\ndiscouraged by these conditions nor blind to the real cause of their\r\nmisfortunes. They realized that the easy conquest of their country\r\nand the utter disregard by their people of the bad government which\r\nhad preceded it, showed that something was wrong with themselves.\r\n\r\nToo wise to exhaust their land by carrying on a hopeless war,\r\nthey sought rather to get a better government by deserving it,\r\nand worked for the general enlightenment, believing that it would\r\noffer the most effective opposition to oppression, for they knew well\r\nthat an intelligent people could not be kept enslaved. Furthermore,\r\nthey understood that, even if they were freed from foreign rule, the\r\nchange would be merely to another tyranny unless the darkness of the\r\nwhole people were dispelled. The few educated men among them would\r\ninevitably tyrannize over the ignorant many sooner or later, and it\r\nwould be less easy to escape from the evils of such misrule, for the\r\nopposition to it would be divided, while the strength of union would\r\noppose any foreign despotism. These true patriots were more concerned\r\nabout the welfare of their country than ambitious for themselves,\r\nand they worked to prepare their countrymen for self-government by\r\nteaching self-control and respect for the rights of others.\r\n\r\nNo public effort toward popular education can be made under a bad\r\ngovernment. Those opposed to Manchu rule knew of a secret society\r\nthat had long existed in spite of the laws against it, and they used\r\nit as their model in organizing a new society to carry out their\r\npurposes. Some of them were members of this Ke-Ming-Tong or Chinese\r\nFreemasonry as it is called, and it was difficult for outsiders to\r\nfind out the differences between it and the new Heaven-Earth-Man\r\nBrotherhood. The three parts to their name led the new brotherhood\r\nlater to be called the Triad Society, and they used a triangle for\r\ntheir seal.\r\n\r\nThe initiates of the Triad were pledged to one another in a blood\r\ncompact to \"depose the Tsing [Tartar] and restore the Ming [native\r\nChinese] dynasty.\" But really the society wanted only gradual reform\r\nand was against any violent changes. It was at first evolutionary, but\r\nlater a section became dissatisfied and started another society. The\r\noriginal brotherhood, however, kept on trying to educate its\r\nmembers. It wanted them to realize that the dignity of manhood is\r\nabove that of rank or riches, and seeking to break down the barriers\r\nof different languages and local prejudice, hoped to create an united\r\nChina efficient in its home government and respected in its foreign\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nIt was the policy of Spain to rule by keeping the different elements\r\namong her subjects embittered against one another. Consequently the\r\nentire Chinese population of the Philippines had several times been\r\nalmost wiped out by the Spaniards assisted by the Filipinos and\r\nresident Japanese. Although overcrowding was mainly the cause of\r\nthe Chinese immigration, the considerations already described seem\r\nto have influenced the better class of emigrants who incorporated\r\nthemselves with the Filipinos from 1642 on through the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Apparently these emigrants left their Chinese homes to avoid\r\nthe shaven crown and long braided queue that the Manchu conquerors\r\nwere imposing as a sign of submission--a practice recalled by\r\nthe recent wholesale cutting off of queues which marked the fall\r\nof this same Manchu dynasty upon the establishment of the present\r\nrepublic. The patriot Chinese in Manila retained the ancient style,\r\nwhich somewhat resembled the way Koreans arrange their hair. Those who\r\nbecame Christians cut the hair short and wore European hats, otherwise\r\nusing the clothing--blue cotton for the poor, silk for the richer--and\r\nfelt-soled shoes, still considered characteristically Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the brutal treatment of the unhappy exiles and the\r\ncauses of the frequent accusation against them that they were intending\r\nrebellion may be found in the fear that had been inspired by the\r\nChinese pirates, and the apprehension that the Chinese traders and\r\nworkmen would take away from the Filipinos their means of gaining a\r\nlivelihood. At times unjust suspicions drove some of the less patient\r\nto take up arms in self-defense. Then many entirely innocent persons\r\nwould be massacred, while those who had not bought protection from\r\nsome powerful Spaniard would have their property pillaged by mobs that\r\nprotested excessive devotion to Spain and found their patriotism so\r\nprofitable that they were always eager to stir up trouble.\r\n\r\nOne of the last native Chinese emperors, not wishing that any of\r\nhis subjects should live outside his dominions, informed the Spanish\r\nauthorities that he considered the emigrants evil persons unworthy\r\nof his interest. His Manchu successors had still more reason to be\r\ncareless of the fate of the Manila Chinese. They were consequently ill\r\ntreated with impunity, while the Japanese were \"treated very cordially,\r\nas they are a race that demand good treatment, and it is advisable\r\nto do so for the friendly relations between the Islands and Japan,\"\r\nto quote the ancient history once more.\r\n\r\nPagan or Christian, a Chinaman's life in Manila then was not an\r\nenviable one, though the Christians were slightly more secure. The\r\nChinese quarter was at first inside the city, but before long it became\r\na considerable district of several streets along Arroceros near the\r\npresent Botanical Garden. Thus the Chinese were under the guns of the\r\nBastion San Gabriel, which also commanded two other Chinese settlements\r\nacross the river in Tondo--Minondoc, or Binondo, and Baybay. They had\r\ntheir own headmen, their own magistrates and their own prison, and no\r\noutsiders were permitted among them. The Dominican Friars, who also\r\nhad a number of missionary stations in China, maintained a church and\r\na hospital for these Manila Chinese and established a settlement where\r\nthose who became Christians might live with their families. Writers\r\nof that day suggest that sometimes conversions were prompted by the\r\ndesire to get married--which until 1898 could not be done outside the\r\nChurch--or to help the convert's business or to secure the protection\r\nof an influential Spanish godfather, rather than by any changed belief.\r\n\r\nCertainly two of these reasons did not influence the conversion of\r\nDoctor Rizal's paternal ancestor, Lam-co (that is, \"Lam, Esq.\"),\r\nfor this Chinese had a Chinese godfather and was not married till\r\nmany years later.\r\n\r\nHe was a native of the Chinchew district, where the Jesuits first, and\r\nlater the Dominicans, had had missions, and he perhaps knew something\r\nof Christianity before leaving China. One of his church records\r\nindicates his home more definitely, for it specifies Siongque, near\r\nthe great city, an agricultural community, and in China cultivation\r\nof the soil is considered the most honorable employment. Curiously\r\nenough, without conversion, the people of that region even to-day\r\nconsider themselves akin to the Christians. They believe in one god\r\nand have characteristics distinguishing them from the Pagan Chinese,\r\npossibly derived from some remote Mohammedan ancestors.\r\n\r\nLam-co's prestige among his own people, as shown by his leadership of\r\nthose who later settled with him in Binan, as well as the fact that\r\neven after his residence in the country he was called to Manila to\r\nact as godfather, suggests that he was above the ordinary standing,\r\nand certainly not of the coolie class. This is bogne out by his\r\nmarrying the daughter of an educated Chinese, an alliance that was\r\nnot likely to have been made unless he was a person of some education,\r\nand education is the Chinese test of social degree.\r\n\r\nHe was baptized in the Parian church of San Gabriel on a Sunday in June\r\nof 1697. Lam-co's age was given in the record as thirty-five years,\r\nand the names of his parents were given as Siang-co and Zun-nio. The\r\nsecond syllables of these names are titles of a little more respect\r\nthan the ordinary \"Mr.\" and \"Mrs.,\" something like the Spanish Don\r\nand Dona, but possibly the Dominican priest who kept the register\r\nwas not so careful in his use of Chinese words as a Chinese would\r\nhave been. Following the custom of the other converts on the same\r\noccasion, Lam-co took the name Domingo, the Spanish for Sunday, in\r\nhonor of the day. The record of this baptism is still to be seen in\r\nthe records of the Parian church of San Gabriel, which are preserved\r\nwith the Binondo records, in Manila.\r\n\r\nChinchew, the capital of the district from which he came, was a\r\nliterary center and a town famed in Chinese history for its loyalty;\r\nit was probably the great port Zeitung which so strongly impressed\r\nthe Venetian traveler Marco Polo, the first European to see China.\r\n\r\nThe city was said by later writers to be large and beautiful and to\r\ncontain half a million inhabitants, \"candid, open and friendly people,\r\nespecially friendly and polite to foreigners.\" It was situated forty\r\nmiles from the sea, in the province of Fokien, the rocky coast of which\r\nhas been described as resembling Scotland, and its sturdy inhabitants\r\nseem to have borne some resemblance to the Scotch in their love of\r\nliberty. The district now is better known by its present port of Amoy.\r\n\r\nAltogether, in wealth, culture and comfort, Lam-co's home city far\r\nsurpassed the Manila of that day, which was, however, patterned after\r\nit. The walls of Manila, its paved streets, stone bridges, and large\r\nhouses with spacious courts are admitted by Spanish writers to be due\r\nto the industry and skill of Chinese workmen. They were but slightly\r\nchanged from their Chinese models, differing mainly in ornamentation,\r\nso that to a Chinese the city by the Pasig, to which he gave the name\r\nof \"the city of horses,\" did not seem strange, but reminded him rather\r\nof his own country.\r\n\r\nFamine in his native district, or the plague which followed it,\r\nmay have been the cause of Lam-co's leaving home, but it was more\r\nprobably political troubles which transferred to the Philippines\r\nthat intelligent and industrious stock whose descendants have proved\r\nsuch loyal and creditable sons of their adopted country. Chinese had\r\ncome to the Islands centuries before the Spaniards arrived and they\r\nare still coming, but no other period has brought such a remarkable\r\ncontribution to the strong race which the mixture of many peoples\r\nhas built up in the Philippines. Few are the Filipinos notable in\r\nrecent history who cannot trace descent from a Chinese baptized in\r\nSan Gabriel church during the century following 1642; until recently\r\nmany have felt ashamed of these really creditable ancestors.\r\n\r\nSoon after Lam-co came to Manila he made the acquaintance of two\r\nwell-known Dominicans and thus made friendships that changed his career\r\nand materially affected the fortunes of his descendants. These powerful\r\nfriends were the learned Friar Francisco Marquez, author of a Chinese\r\ngrammar, and Friar Juan Caballero, a former missionary in China,\r\nwho, because of his own work and because his brother held high office\r\nthere, was influential in the business affairs of the Order. Through\r\nthem Lam-co settled in Binan, on the Dominican estate named after\r\n\"St. Isidore the Laborer.\" There, near where the Pasig river flows\r\nout of the Laguna de Bay, Lam-co's descendants were to be tenants\r\nuntil another government, not yet born, and a system unknown in his\r\nday, should end a long series of inevitable and vexatious disputes by\r\nbuying the estate and selling it again, on terms practicable for them,\r\nto those who worked the land.\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos were at law over boundaries and were claiming the\r\nproperty that had been early and cheaply acquired by the Order as\r\nendowment for its university and other charities. The Friars of\r\nthe Parian quarter thought to take those of their parishioners in\r\nwhom they had most confidence out of harm's way, and by the same act\r\nsecure more satisfactory tenants, for prejudice was then threatening\r\nanother indiscriminate massacre. So they settled many industrious\r\nChinese converts upon these farms, and flattered themselves that\r\ntheir tenant troubles were ended, for these foreigners could have no\r\npossible claim to the land. The Chinese were equally pleased to have\r\nsafer homes and an occupation which in China placed them in a social\r\nposition superior to that of a tradesman.\r\n\r\nDomingo Lam-co was influential in building up Tubigan barrio, one\r\nof the richest parts of the great estate. In name and appearance\r\nit recalled the fertile plains that surrounded his native Chinchew,\r\n\"the city of springs.\" His neighbors were mainly Chinchew men, and\r\nwhat is of more importance to this narrative, the wife whom he married\r\njust before removing to the farm was of a good Chinchew family. She\r\nwas Inez de la Rosa and but half Domingo's age; they were married\r\nin the Parian church by the same priest who over thirty years before\r\nhad baptized her husband.\r\n\r\nHer father was Agustin Chinco, also of Chinchew, a rice merchant,\r\nwho had been baptized five years earlier than Lam-co. His baptismal\r\nrecord suggests that he was an educated man, as already indicated,\r\nfor the name of his town proved a puzzle till a present-day Dominican\r\nmissionary from Amoy explained that it appeared to be the combined\r\nnames for Chinchew in both the common and literary Chinese, in each\r\ncase with the syllable denoting the town left off. Apparently when\r\nquestioned from what town he came, Chinco was careful not to repeat\r\nthe word town, but gave its name only in the literary language,\r\nand when that was not understood, he would repeat it in the local\r\ndialect. The priest, not understanding the significance of either in\r\nthat form, wrote down the two together as a single word. Knowledge\r\nof the literary Chinese, or Mandarin, as it is generally called,\r\nmarked the educated man, and, as we have already pointed out,\r\neducation in China meant social position. To such minute deductions\r\nis it necessary to resort when records are scarce, and to be of value\r\nthe explanation must be in harmony with the conditions of the period;\r\nsubsequent research has verified the foregoing conclusions.\r\n\r\nAgustin Chinco had also a Chinese godfather and his parents were\r\nChin-co and Zun-nio. He was married to Jacinta Rafaela, a Chinese\r\nmestiza of the Parian, as soon after his baptism as the banns could\r\nbe published. She apparently was the daughter of a Christian Chinese\r\nand a Chinese mestiza; there were too many of the name Jacinta in that\r\nday to identify which of the several Jacintas she was and so enable us\r\nto determine the names of her parents. The Rafaela part of her name\r\nwas probably added after she was grown up, in honor of the patron of\r\nthe Parian settlement, San Rafael, just as Domingo, at his marriage,\r\nadded Antonio in honor of the Chinese. How difficult guides names\r\nthen were may be seen from this list of the six children of Agustin\r\nChinco and Jacinta Rafaela: Magdalena Vergara, Josepha, Cristoval de\r\nla Trinidad, Juan Batista, Francisco Hong-Sun and Inez de la Rosa.\r\n\r\nThe father-in-law and the son-in-law, Agustin and Domingo, seem to\r\nhave been old friends, and apparently of the same class. Lam-co must\r\nhave seen his future wife, the youngest in Chinco's numerous family,\r\ngrow up from babyhood, and probably was attracted by the idea that\r\nshe would make a good housekeeper like her thrifty mother, rather\r\nthan by any romantic feelings, for sentiment entered very little into\r\nmatrimony in those days when the parents made the matches. Possibly,\r\nhowever, their married life was just as happy, for divorces then were\r\nnot even thought of, and as this couple prospered they apparently\r\nworked well together in a financial way.\r\n\r\nThe next recorded event in the life of Domingo Lam-co and his wife\r\noccurred in 1741 when, after years of apparently happy existence in\r\nBinan, came a great grief in the loss of their baby daughter, Josepha\r\nDidnio, probably named for her aunt. She had lived only five days,\r\nbut payments to the priest for a funeral such as was not given to\r\nmany grown persons who died that year in Binan show how keenly the\r\nparents felt the loss of their little girl. They had at the time but\r\none other child, a boy of ten, Francisco Mercado, whose Christian\r\nname was given partly because he had an uncle of the same name,\r\nand partly as a tribute of gratitude to the friendly Friar scholar\r\nin Manila. His new surname suggests that the family possessed the\r\ncommendable trait of taking pride in its ancestry.\r\n\r\nAmong the Chinese the significance of a name counts for much and it\r\nis always safe to seek a reason for the choice of a name. The Lam-co\r\nfamily were not given to the practice of taking the names of their\r\ngod-parents. Mercado recalls both an honest Spanish encomendero\r\nof the region, also named Francisco, and a worthy mestizo Friar,\r\nnow remembered for his botanical studies, but it is not likely that\r\nthese influenced Domingo Lam-co in choosing this name for his son. He\r\ngave his boy a name which in the careless Castilian of the country was\r\nbut a Spanish translation of the Chinese name by which his ancestors\r\nhad been called. Sangley, Mercado and Merchant mean much the same;\r\nFrancisco therefore set out in life with a surname that would free\r\nhim from the prejudice that followed those with Chinese names,\r\nand yet would remind him of his Chinese ancestry. This was wisdom,\r\nfor seldom are men who are ashamed of their ancestry any credit to it.\r\n\r\nThe family history has to be gleaned from partially preserved parochial\r\nregisters of births, marriages and deaths, incomplete court records,\r\nthe scanty papers of the estates, a few land transfers, and some stray\r\nwritings that accidentally have been preserved with the latter. The\r\nnext event in Domingo's life which is revealed by them is a visit\r\nto Manila where in the old Parian church he acted as sponsor,\r\nor godfather, at the baptism of a countryman, and a new convert,\r\nSiong-co, whose granddaughter was, we shall see, to marry a grandson\r\nof Lam-co's, the couple becoming Rizal's grandparents.\r\n\r\nFrancisco was a grown man when his mother died and was buried with\r\nthe elaborate ceremonies which her husband's wealth permitted. There\r\nwas a coffin, a niche in which to put it, chanting of the service and\r\nspecial prayers. All these involved extra cost, and the items noted in\r\nthe margin of her funeral record make a total which in those days was\r\na considerable sum. Domingo outlived Mrs. Lam-co by but a few years,\r\nand he also had, for the time, an expensive funeral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nLiberalizing Hereditary Influences\r\n\r\nThe hope of the Binan landlords that by changing from Filipino to\r\nChinese tenantry they could avoid further litigation seems to have\r\nbeen disappointed. A family tradition of Francisco Mercado tells of\r\na tedious and costly lawsuit with the Order. Its details and merits\r\nare no longer remembered, and they are not important.\r\n\r\nHistory has recorded enough agrarian trouble, in all ages and in all\r\ncountries, to prove the economic mistake of large holdings of land by\r\nthose who do not cultivate it. Human nature is alike the world over,\r\nit does not change with the centuries, and just as the Filipinos\r\nhad done, the Chinese at last obiected to paying increased rent for\r\nimprovements which they made themselves.\r\n\r\nA Spanish iudge required the landlords to produce their deeds, and,\r\nafter measuring the land, he decided that they were then taking rent\r\nfor considerably more than they had originally bought or had been\r\ngiven. But the tenants lost on the appeal, and, as they thought it\r\nwas because they were weak and their opponents powerful, a grievance\r\ngrew up which was still remembered in Rizal's day and was well known\r\nand understood by him.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of discontent, which was a liberalizing influence,\r\nwas making itself felt in the Philippines about the time of Domingo's\r\ndeath. A number of Spaniards had been claiming for their own countrymen\r\nsuch safeguards of personal liberty as were enjoyed by Englishmen,\r\nfor no other government in Europe then paid any attention to the rights\r\nof the individual. Learned men had devoted much study to the laws and\r\nrights of nations, but these Spanish Liberals insisted that it was the\r\nguarantees given to the citizens, and not the political independence\r\nof the State, that made a country really free. Unfortunately, just\r\nas their proposals began to gain followers, Spain became involved in\r\nwar with England, because the Spanish King, then as now a Bourbon\r\nand so related to a number of other reactionary rulers, had united\r\nin the family compact by which the royal relatives were to stamp out\r\nliberal ideas in their own dominions, and as allies to crush England,\r\nthe source of the dissatisfaction which threatened their thrones.\r\n\r\nMany progressive Spaniards had become Freemasons, when that ancient\r\nsociety, after its revival in England, had been reintroduced into\r\nSpain. Now they found themselves suspected of sympathy with England\r\nand therefore of treason to Spain. While this could not be proved,\r\nit led to enforcing a papal bull against them, by which Pope Clement\r\nXII placed their institution under the ban of excommunication.\r\n\r\nAt first it was intended to execute all the Spanish Freemasons, but\r\nthe Queen's favorite violinist secretly sympathized with them. He used\r\nhis influence with Her Majesty so well that through her intercession\r\nthe King commuted the sentences from death to banishment as minor\r\nofficials in the possessions overseas.\r\n\r\nThus Cuba, Mexico, South and Central America, and the Philippines were\r\nprovided with the ablest Spanish advocates of modern ideas. In no other\r\nway could liberalism have been spread so widely or more effectively.\r\n\r\nBesides these officeholders there had been from the earliest days\r\nnoblemen, temporarily out of favor at Court, in banishment in the\r\ncolonies. Cavite had some of these exiles, who were called \"caja\r\nabierta,\" or carte blanche, because their generous allowances, which\r\ncould be drawn whenever there were government funds, seemed without\r\nlimit to the Filipinos. The Spanish residents of the Philippines were\r\nnaturally glad to entertain, supply money to, and otherwise serve\r\nthese men of noble birth, who might at any time be restored to favor\r\nand again be influential, and this gave them additional prestige in the\r\neyes of the Filipinos. One of these exiles, whose descendants yet live\r\nin these Islands, passed from prisoner in Cavite to viceroy in Mexico.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Mercado lived near enough to hear of the \"cajas abiertas\"\r\n(exiles) and their ways, if he did not actually meet some of them\r\nand personally experience the charm of their courtesy. They were as\r\ndifferent from the ruder class of Spaniards who then were coming to\r\nthe Islands as the few banished officials were unlike the general run\r\nof officeholders. The contrast naturally suggested that the majority of\r\nthe Spaniards in the Philippines, both in official and in private life,\r\nwere not creditable representatives of their country. This charge,\r\ninsisted on with greater vehemence as subsequent events furnished\r\nfurther reasons for doing so, embittered the controversies of the\r\nlast century of Spanish rule. The very persons who realized that the\r\naccusation was true of themselves, were those who most resented it,\r\nand the opinion of them which they knew the Filipinos held but dared\r\nnot voice, rankled in their breasts. They welcomed every disparagement\r\nof the Philippines and its people, and thus made profitable a\r\nsenseless and abusive campaign which was carried on by unscrupulous,\r\nirresponsible writers of such defective education that vilification\r\nwas their sole argument. Their charges were easily disproved, but they\r\nhad enough cunning to invent new charges continually, and prejudice\r\ngave ready credence to them.\r\n\r\nFinally an unreasoning fury broke out and in blind passion innocent\r\npersons were struck down; the taste for blood once aroused,\r\nirresponsible writers like that Retana who has now become Rizal's\r\nbiographer, whetted the savage appetite for fresh victims. The\r\nlast fifty years of Spanish rule in the Philippines was a small\r\nsaturnalia of revenge with hardly a lucid interval for the governing\r\npower to reflect or an opportunity for the reasonable element to\r\nintervene. Somewhat similarly the Bourbons in France had hoped to\r\npostpone the day of reckoning for their mistakes by misdeeds done\r\nin fear to terrorize those who sought reforms. The aristocracy of\r\nFrance paid back tenfold each drop of innocent blood that was shed,\r\nbut while the unreasoning world recalls the French Revolution with\r\nhorror, the student of history thinks more of the evils which made\r\nit a natural result. Mirabeau in vain sought to restrain his aroused\r\ncountrymen, just as he had vainly pleaded with the aristocrats to end\r\ntheir excesses. Rizal, who held Mirabeau for his hero among the men of\r\nthe French Revolution, knew the historical lesson and sought to sound\r\na warning, but he was unheeded by the Spaniards and misunderstood by\r\nmany of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nAt about the time of the arrival of the Spanish political exiles\r\nwe find in Manila a proof of the normal mildness of Spain in\r\nthe Philippines. The Inquisition, of dread name elsewhere, in the\r\nPhilippines affected only Europeans, had before it two English-speaking\r\npersons, an Irish doctor and a county merchant accused of being\r\nFreemasons. The kind-hearted Friar inquisitor dismissed the culprits\r\nwith warnings, and excepting some Spanish political matters in which\r\nit took part, this was the nearest that the institution ever came to\r\nexercising its functions here.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of the Indians in the Spanish-American gold mines, too,\r\nhad no Philippine counterpart, for at the instance of the friars the\r\nChurch early forbade the enslaving of the people. Neither friars nor\r\ngovernment have any records in the Philippines which warrant belief\r\nthat they were responsible for the severe punishments of the period\r\nfrom '72 to '98. Both were connected with opposition to reforms\r\nwhich appeared likely to jeopardize their property or to threaten\r\ntheir prerogatives, and in this they were only human, but here their\r\nselfish interests and activities seem to cease.\r\n\r\nFor religious reasons the friar orders combatted modern ideas which\r\nthey feared might include atheistical teachings such as had made\r\ntrouble in France, and the Government was against the introduction of\r\nlatter-day thought of democratic tendency, but in both instances the\r\nopposition may well have been believed to be for the best interest\r\nof the Philippine people. However mistaken, their action can only be\r\ndeplored not censured. The black side of this matter was the rousing\r\nof popular passion, and it was done by sheets subsidized to argue;\r\ntheir editors, however, resorted to abuse in order to conceal the fact\r\nthat they had not the ability to perform the services for which they\r\nwere hired. While some individual members of both the religious orders\r\nand of the Government were influenced by these inflaming attacks,\r\nthe interests concerned, as organizations, seem to have had a policy\r\nof self-defense, and not of revenge.\r\n\r\nThe theory here advanced must wait for the judgment of the reader\r\ntill the later events have been submitted. However, Rizal himself\r\nmay be called in to prove that the record and policy is what has been\r\nasserted, for otherwise he would hardly have disregarded, as he did,\r\nthe writings of Motley and Prescott, historians whom he could have\r\nquoted with great advantage to support the attacks he would surely\r\nhave not failed to make had they seemed to him warranted, for he\r\nnever was wanting in knowledge, resourcefulness or courage where his\r\ncountry was concerned.\r\n\r\nNo definite information is available as to what part Francisco\r\nMercado took during the disturbed two years when the English held\r\nManila and Judge Anda carried on a guerilla warfare. The Dominicans\r\nwere active in enlisting their tenants to fight against the invaders,\r\nand probably he did his share toward the Spanish defense either with\r\ncontributions or personal service. The attitude of the region in\r\nwhich he lived strengthens this surmise, for only after long-continued\r\nwrongs and repeatedly broken promises of redress did Filipino loyalty\r\nfail. This was a century too early for the country around Manila,\r\nwhich had been better protected and less abused than the provinces\r\nto the north where the Ilokanos revolted.\r\n\r\nBinan, however, was within the sphere of English influence, for\r\nAnda's campaign was not quite so formidable as the inscription on his\r\nmonument in Manila represents it to be, and he was far indeed from\r\nbeing the great conqueror that the tablet on the Santa Cruz Church\r\ndescribes him. Because of its nearness to Manila and Cavite and\r\nits rich gardens, British soldiers and sailors often visited Binan,\r\nbut as the inhabitants never found occasion to abandon their homes,\r\nthey evidently suffered no serious inconvenience.\r\n\r\nCommerce, a powerful factor, destroying the hermit character of\r\nthe Islands, gained by the short experience of freer trade under\r\nEngland's rule, since the Filipinos obtained a taste for articles\r\nbefore unused, which led them to be discontented and insistent, till\r\nthe Manila market finally came to be better supplied. The contrast\r\nof the British judicial system with the Spanish tribunals was also a\r\nrevelation, for the foulest blot upon the colonial administration of\r\nSpain was her iniquitous courts of justice, and this was especially\r\ntrue of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAnda's triumphal entry into the capital was celebrated with a wholesale\r\nhanging of Chinese, which must have made Francisco Mercado glad that\r\nhe was now so identified with the country as to escape the prejudice\r\nagainst his race.\r\n\r\nA few years later came the expulsion of the Jesuit fathers and the\r\nconfiscation of their property. It certainly weakened the government;\r\npersonal acquaintance counted largely with the Filipinos; whole\r\nparishes knew Spain and the Church only through their parish priest,\r\nand the parish priest was usually a Jesuit whose courtesy equalled that\r\nof the most aristocratic officeholder or of any exiled \"caja abierta.\"\r\n\r\nFrancisco Mercado did not live in a Jesuit parish but in the\r\nneighboring hacienda of St. John the Baptist at Kalamba, where there\r\nwas a great dam and an extensive irrigation system which caused the\r\nland to rival in fertility the rich soil of Binan. Everybody in his\r\nneighborhood knew that the estate had been purchased with money left\r\nin Mexico by pious Spaniards who wanted to see Christianity spread in\r\nthe Philippines, and it seemed to them sacrilege that the government\r\nshould take such property for its own secular uses.\r\n\r\nThe priests in Binan were Filipinos and were usually leaders among\r\nthe secular clergy, for the parish was desirable beyond most in the\r\narchdiocese because of its nearness to Manila, its excellent climate,\r\nits well-to-do parishioners and the great variety of its useful and\r\nornamental plants and trees. Many of the fruits and vegetables of\r\nBinan were little known elsewhere, for they were of American origin,\r\nbrought by Dominicans on the voyages from Spain by way of Mexico. They\r\nwere introduced first into the great gardens at the hacienda house,\r\nwhich was a comfortable and spacious building adjoining the church,\r\nand the favorite resting place for members of the Order in Manila.\r\n\r\nThe attendance of the friars on Sundays and fete days gave to the\r\nreligious services on these occasions a dignity usually belonging to\r\ncity churches. Sometimes, too, some of the missionaries from China\r\nand other Dominican notables would be seen in Binan. So the people\r\nnot only had more of the luxuries and the pomp of life than most\r\nFilipinos, but they had a broader outlook upon it. Their opinion\r\nof Spain was formed from acquaintance with many Spaniards and from\r\ncomparing them with people of other lands who often came to Manila and\r\ninvestigated the region close to it, especially the show spots such\r\nas Binan. Then they were on the road to the fashionable baths at Los\r\nBanos, where the higher officials often resorted. Such opportunities\r\ngave a sort of education, and Binan people were in this way more\r\ncultured than the dwellers in remote places, whose only knowledge of\r\ntheir sovereign state was derived from a single Spaniard, the friar\r\ncurate of their parish.\r\n\r\nMonastic training consists in withdrawing from the world and living\r\nisolated under strict rule, and this would scarcely seem to be\r\nthe best preparation for such responsibility as was placed upon the\r\nFriars. Troubles were bound to come, and the people of Binan, knowing\r\nthe ways of the world, would soon be likely to complain and demand the\r\nchanges which would avoid them; the residents of less worldly wise\r\ncommunities would wait and suffer till too late, and then in blind\r\nwrath would wreak bloody vengeance upon guilty and innocent alike.\r\n\r\nKalamba, a near neighbor of Binan, had other reasons for being known\r\nbesides its confiscation by the government. It was the scene of an\r\nearly and especially cruel massacre of Chinese, and about Francisco's\r\ntime considerable talk had been occasioned because an archbishop had\r\nestablished an uniform scale of charges for the various rites of the\r\nChurch. While these charges were often complained of, it was the poorer\r\npeople (some of whom were in receipt of charity) who suffered. The\r\nrich were seeking more expensive ceremonies in order to outshine the\r\nother well-to-do people of their neighborhood. The real grievance was,\r\nhowever, not the cost, but the fact that political discriminations\r\nwere made so that those who were out of favor with the government\r\nwere likewise deprived of church privileges. The reform of Archbishop\r\nSanto y Rufino has importance only because it gave the people of the\r\nprovinces what Manila had long possessed--a knowledge of the rivalry\r\nbetween the secular and the regular clergy.\r\n\r\nThe people had learned in Governor Bustamente's time that Church and\r\nState did not always agree, and now they saw dissensions within the\r\nChurch. The Spanish Conquest and the possession of the Philippines\r\nhad been made easy by the doctrine of the indivisibility of Church\r\nand State, by the teaching that the two were one and inseparable,\r\nbut events were continually demonstrating the falsity of this early\r\nteaching. Hence the foundation of the sovereignty of Spain was\r\nslowly weakening, and nowhere more surely than in the region near\r\nManila which numbered Jose Rizal's keen-witted and observing great\r\ngrandfather among its leading men.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Mercado was a bachelor during the times of these exciting\r\nevents and therefore more free to visit Manila and Cavite, and he was\r\npossibly the more likely to be interested in political matters. He\r\nmarried on May 26, 1771, rather later in life than was customary in\r\nBinan, though he was by no means as old as his father, Domingo, was\r\nwhen he married. His bride, Bernarda Monicha, was a Chinese mestiza\r\nof the neighboring hacienda of San Pedro Tunasan, who had been early\r\norphaned and from childhood had lived in Binan. As the coadjutor priest\r\nof the parish bore the same name, one uncommon in the Binan records\r\nof that period, it is possible that he was a relative. The frequent\r\noccurrence of the name of Monicha among the last names of girls of\r\nthat vicinity later on must be ascribed to Bernarda's popularity\r\nas godmother.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Francisco Mercado had two children, both boys, Juan and\r\nClemente. During their youth the people of the Philippines were greatly\r\ninterested in the struggles going on between England, the old enemy\r\nof Spain, and the rebellious English-American colonies. So bitter was\r\nthe Spanish hatred of the nation which had humiliated her repeatedly\r\non both land and sea, that the authorities forgot their customary\r\ncaution and encouraged the circulation of any story that told in favor\r\nof the American colonies. Little did they realize the impression that\r\nthe statement of grievances--so trivial compared with the injustices\r\nthat were being inflicted upon the Spanish colonials--was making upon\r\ntheir subjects overseas, who until then had been carefully guarded from\r\nall modern ideas of government. American successes were hailed with\r\nenthusiasm in the most remote towns, and from this time may be dated\r\na perceptible increase in Philippine discontent. Till then outbreaks\r\nand uprisings had been more for revenge than with any well-considered\r\naim, but henceforth complaints became definite, demands were made\r\nthat to an increasing number of people appeared to be reasonable,\r\nand those demands were denied or ignored, or promises were made in\r\nanswer to them which were never fulfilled.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Mercado was well to do, if we may judge from the number of\r\ncarabaos he presented for registration, for his was among the largest\r\nherds in the book of brands that has chanced to be preserved with the\r\nBinan church records. In 1783 he was alcalde, or chief officer of the\r\ntown, and he lived till 1801. His name appears so often as godfather\r\nin the registers of baptisms and weddings that he must have been a\r\ngood-natured, liberal and popular man.\r\n\r\nMrs. Francisco Mercado survived her husband by a number of years,\r\nand helped to nurse through his baby ailments a grandson also named\r\nFrancisco, the father of Doctor Rizal.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Mercado's eldest son, Juan, built a fine house in the center\r\nof Binan, where its pretentious stone foundations yet stand to attest\r\nhow the home deserved the pride which the family took in it.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-two Juan married a girl of Tubigan, who was two years his\r\nelder, Cirila Alejandra, daughter of Domingo Lam-co's Chinese godson,\r\nSiong-co. Cirila's father's silken garments were preserved by the\r\nfamily until within the memory of persons now living, and it is likely\r\nthat Jose Rizal, Siong-co's great-grandson, while in school at Binan,\r\nsaw these tangible proofs of the social standing in China of this\r\none of his ancestors.\r\n\r\nJuan Mercado was three times the chief officer of Binan--in 1808, 1813\r\nand 1823. His sympathies are evident from the fact that he gave the\r\nsecond name, Fernando, to the son born when the French were trying\r\nto get the Filipinos to declare for King Joseph, whom his brother\r\nNapoleon had named sovereign of Spain. During the little while that the\r\nPhilippines profited by the first constitution of Spain, Mercado was\r\none of the two alcaldes. King Ferdinand VII then was relying on English\r\naid, and to please his allies as well as to secure the loyalty of his\r\nsubjects, Ferdinand pretended to be a very liberal monarch, swearing\r\nto uphold the constitution which the representatives of the people\r\nhad framed at Cadiz in 1812. Under this constitution the Filipinos\r\nwere to be represented in the Spanish Cortes, and the grandfather of\r\nRizal was one of the electors to choose the Representative.\r\n\r\nDuring the next twenty-five years the history of the connection of the\r\nPhilippines with Spain is mainly a record of the breaking and renewing\r\nof the King's oaths to the constitution, and of the Philippines\r\nelecting delegates who would find the Cortes dissolved by the time\r\nthey could get to Madrid, until in the final constitution that did\r\nlast Philippine representation was left out altogether. Had things\r\nbeen different the sad story of this book might never have been told,\r\nfor though the misgovernment of the Philippines was originally owing\r\nto the disregard for the Laws of the Indies and to giving unrestrained\r\npower to officials, the effects of these mistakes were not apparent\r\nuntil well into the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nAnother influence which educated the Filipino people was at work during\r\nthis period. They had heard the American Revolution extolled and its\r\ncourse approved, because the Spaniards disliked England. Then came\r\nthe French Revolution, which appalled the civilized world. A people,\r\nignorant and oppressed, washed out in blood the wrongs which they had\r\nsuffered, but their liberty degenerated into license, their ideals\r\nproved impracticable, and the anarchy of their radical republic was\r\nsucceeded by the military despotism of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nA book written in Tagalog by a friar pointed out the differences\r\nbetween true liberty and false. It was the story of an old municipal\r\ncaptain who had traveled and returned to enlighten his friends at\r\nhome. The story was well told, and the catechism form in which, by\r\nhis friends' questions and the answers to them, the author's opinions\r\nwere presented, was familiar to Filipinos, so that there were many\r\nintelligent readers, but its results were quite different from what\r\nits pious and patriotic author had intended they should be.\r\n\r\nThe book told of the broadening influences of travel and of education;\r\nit suggested that liberty was possible only for the intelligent, but\r\nthat schools, newspapers, libraries and the means of travel which the\r\nAmerican colonists were enjoying were not provided for the Filipinos.\r\n\r\nThey were further told that the Spanish colonies in America were\r\nrepeating the unhappy experiences of the French republic, while\r\nthe \"English North Americans,\" whose ships during the American\r\nRevolution had found the Pacific a safe refuge from England,\r\nhad developed considerable commerce with the Philippines. A kindly\r\nfeeling toward the Americans had been aroused by the praise given to\r\nFilipino mechanics who had been trained by an American naval officer\r\nto repair his ship when the Spaniards at the government dockyards\r\nproved incapable of doing the work. Even the first American Consul,\r\nwhose monument yet remains in the Plaza Cervantes, Manila, though,\r\nbecause of his faith, he could not be buried in the consecrated ground\r\nof the Catholic cemeteries, received what would appear to be a higher\r\nhonor, a grave in the principal business plaza of the city.\r\n\r\nThe inferences were irresistible: the way of the French Revolution\r\nwas repugnant alike to God and government, that of the American\r\nwas approved by both. Filipinos of reflective turn of mind began to\r\nstudy America; some even had gone there; for, from a little Filipino\r\nsettlement, St. Malo near New Orleans, sailors enlisted to fight\r\nin the second war of the United States against England; one of them\r\nwas wounded and his name was long borne on the pension roll of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe danger of the dense ignorance in which their rulers kept the\r\nFilipinos showed itself in 1819, when a French ship from India having\r\nintroduced Asiatic cholera into the Islands, the lowest classes of\r\nManila ascribed it to the collections of insects and reptiles which\r\na French naturalist, who was a passenger upon the ship, had brought\r\nashore. However the story started, the collection and the dwelling\r\nof the naturalist fared badly, and afterwards the mob, excited by\r\nits success, made war upon all foreigners. At length the excitement\r\nsubsided, but too much damage to foreign lives and property had been\r\ndone to be ignored, and the matter had an ugly look, especially as\r\nno Spaniard had suffered by this outbreak. The Insular government\r\nroused itself to punish some of the minor misdoers and made many\r\nexplanations and apologies, but the aggrieved nations insisted, and\r\nobtained as compensation a greater security for foreigners and the\r\nremoval of many of the restraints upon commerce and travel. Thus the\r\nriot proved a substantial step in Philippine progress.\r\n\r\nFollowing closely the excitement over the massacre of the foreigners\r\nin Manila came the news that Spain had sold Florida to the United\r\nStates. The circumstances of the sale were hardly creditable to the\r\nvendor, for it was under compulsion. Her lax government had permitted\r\nits territory to become the refuge of criminals and lawless savages\r\nwho terrorized the border until in self-defense American soldiers under\r\nGeneral Jackson had to do the work that Spain could not do. Then with\r\norder restored and the country held by American troops, an offer to\r\npurchase was made to Spain who found the liberal purchase money a\r\nvery welcome addition to her bankrupt treasury.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this the Monroe Doctrine attracted widespread\r\nattention in the Philippines. Its story is part of Spanish history. A\r\ngroup of reactionary sovereigns of Europe, including King Ferdinand,\r\nhad united to crush out progressive ideas in their kingdoms and\r\nto remove the dangerous examples of liberal states from their\r\nneighborhoods. One of the effects of this unholy alliance was to\r\nnullify all the reforms which Spain had introduced to secure English\r\nassistance in her time of need, and the people of England were greatly\r\nincensed. Great Britain had borne the brunt of the war against Napoleon\r\nbecause her liberties were jeopardized, but naturally her people could\r\nnot be expected to undertake further warfare merely for the sake of\r\npeople of another land, however they might sympathize with them.\r\n\r\nGeorge Canning, the English statesman to whom belonged much of the\r\ncredit for the Constitution of Cadiz, thought out a way to punish\r\nthe Spanish king for his perfidy. King Ferdinand was planning, with\r\nthe Island of Cuba as a base, to begin a campaign that should return\r\nhis rebellious American colonies to their allegiance, for they had\r\ntaken advantage of disturbances in the Peninsula to declare their\r\nindependence. England proposed to the United States that they, the two\r\nAnglo-Saxon nations whose ideas of liberty had unsettled Europe and\r\nwhom the alliance would have attacked had it dared, should unite in\r\na protectorate over the New World. England was to guard the sea and\r\nthe United States were to furnish the soldiers for any land fighting\r\nwhich might come on their side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nWorld politics had led the enemies of England to help her revolting\r\ncolonies, Napoleon's jealousy of Britain had endowed the new nation\r\nwith the vast Louisiana Territory, and European complications saved the\r\nUnited States from the natural consequences of their disastrous war of\r\n1812, which taught them that union was as necessary to preserve their\r\nindependence as it had been to win it. Canning's project in principle\r\nappealed to the North Americans, but the study of it soon showed that\r\nGreat Britain was selfish in her suggestion. After a generation of\r\nfighting, England found herself drained of soldiers and therefore she\r\ndiplomatically invited the cooeperation of her former colonies; but,\r\nregardless of any formal arrangement, her navy could be relied on to\r\nprevent those who had played her false from transporting large armies\r\nacross the ocean into the neighborhood of her otherwise defenseless\r\ncolonies. That was self-preservation.\r\n\r\nPresident Monroe's advisers were willing that their country should run\r\nsome risk on its own account, but they had the traditional American\r\naversion to entangling alliances. So the Cabinet counseled that the\r\nyoung nation alone should make itself the protector of the South\r\nAmerican republics, and drafted the declaration warning the world\r\nthat aggression against any of the New World democracies would be\r\nresented as unfriendliness to the United States.\r\n\r\nIt was the firm attitude of President Monroe that compelled Spain to\r\nforego the attempt to reconquer her former colonies, and therefore\r\nMexico and Central and South America owe their existence as republics\r\nquite as much to the elder commonwealth as does Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe American attitude revealed in the Monroe Doctrine was especially\r\nobnoxious to the Spaniards in the Philippines but their intemperate\r\ndenunciations of the policy of America for the Americans served only\r\nto spread a knowledge of that doctrine among the people of that little\r\nterritory which remained to them to misgovern. Secretly there began\r\nto be, among the stouter-hearted Filipinos, some who cherished a\r\ncorollary to the Monroe Doctrine, the Philippines for the Filipinos.\r\n\r\nThoughts of separation from Spain by means of rebellion, by sale\r\nand by the assistance of other nations, had been thus put into the\r\nheads of the people. These were all changes coming from outside,\r\nbut it next to be demonstrated that Spain herself did not hold her\r\nnoncontiguous territories as sacred as she did her home dominions.\r\n\r\nThe sale of Florida suggested that Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines\r\nwere also available assets, and an offer to sell them was made to\r\nthe King of France; but this sovereign overreached himself, for,\r\nthinking to drive a better bargain, he claimed that the low prices\r\nwere too high. Thereupon the Spanish Ambassador, who was not in accord\r\nwith his unpatriotic instructions, at once withdrew the offer and\r\nthe negotiations terminated. But the Spanish people learned of the\r\nproposed sale and their indignation was great. The news spread to the\r\nSpaniards in the Philippines. Through their comments the Filipinos\r\nrealized that the much-talked-of sacred integrity of the Spanish\r\ndominions was a meaningless phrase, and that the Philippines would\r\nnot always be Spanish if Spain could get her price.\r\n\r\nGobernadorcillo Mercado, \"Captain Juan,\" as he was called, made a\r\ncreditable figure in his office, and there used to be in Binan a\r\npainting of him with his official sword, cocked hat and embroidered\r\nblouse. The municipal executive in his time did not always wear the\r\nridiculous combination of European and old Tagalog costumes, namely, a\r\nhigh hat and a short jacket over the floating tails of a pleated shirt,\r\nwhich later undignified the position. He has a notable record for his\r\ngenerosity, the absence of oppression and for the official honesty\r\nwhich distinguished his public service from that of many who held\r\nhis same office. He did, however, change the tribute lists so that\r\nhis family were no longer \"Chinese mestizos,\" but were enrolled as\r\n\"Indians,\" the wholesale Spanish term for the natives of all Spain's\r\npossessions overseas. This, in a way, was compensation (it lowered\r\nhis family's tribute) for his having to pay the taxes of all who\r\ndied in Binan or moved away during his term of office. The municipal\r\ncaptain then was held accountable whether the people could pay or not,\r\nno deductions ever being made from the lists. Most gobernadorcillos\r\nfound ways to reimburse themselves, but not Mercado. His family,\r\nhowever, were of the fourth generation in the Philippines and he\r\nevidently thought that they were entitled to be called Filipinos.\r\n\r\nA leader in church work also, and several times \"Hermano mayor\" of\r\nits charitable society, the Captain's name appears on a number of\r\nlists that have come down from that time as a liberal contributor\r\nto various public subscriptions. His wife was equally benevolent,\r\nas the records show.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Mercado did not neglect their family, which was rather\r\nnumerous. Their children were Gavino, Potenciana (who never married),\r\nLeoncio, Fausto, Barcelisa (who became the wife of Hermenegildo\r\nAustria), Gabriel, Julian, Gregorio Fernando, Casimiro, Petrona\r\n(who married Gregorio Neri), Tomasa (later Mrs. F. de Guzman), and\r\nCornelia, the belle of the family, who later lived in Batangas.\r\n\r\nYoung Francisco was only eight years old when his father died, but\r\nhis mother and sister Potenciana looked well after him. First he\r\nattended a Binan Latin school, and later he seems to have studied\r\nLatin and philosophy in the College of San Jose in Manila.\r\n\r\nA sister, Petrona, for some years had been a dressgoods merchant in\r\nnearby Kalamba, on an estate that had recently come under the same\r\nownership as Binan. There she later married, and shortly after was\r\nwidowed. Possibly upon their mother's death, Potenciana and Francisco\r\nremoved to Kalamba; though Petrona died not long after, her brother\r\nand sister continued to make their home there.\r\n\r\nFrancisco, in spite of his youth, became a tenant of the estate as did\r\nsome others of his family, for their Binan holdings were not large\r\nenough to give farms to all Captain Juan's many sons. The landlords\r\nearly recognized the agricultural skill of the Mercados by further\r\nallotments, as they could bring more land under cultivation. Sometimes\r\nFrancisco was able to buy the holdings of others who proved less\r\nsuccessful in their management and became discouraged.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer farming, clearing the miasmatic forests especially, was\r\ndangerous work, and there were few families that did not buy their\r\nland with the lives of some of its members. In 1847 the Mercados\r\nhad funerals, of brothers and nephews of Francisco, and, chief\r\namong them, of that elder sister who had devoted her life to him,\r\nPotenciana. She had always prompted and inspired the young man, and\r\nFrancisco's success in life was largely due to her wise counsels and\r\nher devoted encouragement of his industry and ambition. Her thrifty\r\nmanagement of the home, too, was sadly missed.\r\n\r\nA year after his sister Potenciana's death, Francisco Mercado married\r\nTeodora Alonzo, a native of Manila, who for several years had been\r\nresiding with her mother at Kalamba. The history of the family of\r\nMrs. Mercado is unfortunately not so easily traced as is that of her\r\nhusband, and what is known is of less simplicity and perhaps of more\r\ninterest since the mother's influence is greater than the father's,\r\nand she was the mother of Jose Rizal.\r\n\r\nHer father, Lorenzo Alberto Alonzo (born 1790, died 1854), is said\r\nto have been \"very Chinese\" in appearance. He had a brother who was\r\na priest, and a sister, Isabel, who was quite wealthy; he himself\r\nwas also well to do. Their mother, Maria Florentina (born 1771, died\r\n1817), was, on her mother's side, of the famous Florentina family of\r\nChinese mestizos originating in Baliwag, Bulacan, and her father was\r\nCaptain Mariano Alejandro of Binan.\r\n\r\nLorenzo Alberto was municipal captain of Binan in 1824, as had been his\r\nfather, Captain Cipriano Alonzo (died 18O5), in 1797. The grandfather,\r\nCaptain Gregorio Alonzo (died 1794), was a native of Quiotan barrio,\r\nand twice, in 1763 and again in 1768, at the head of the mestizos'\r\norganization of the Santa Cruz district in Manila.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lorenzo was educated for a surveyor, and his engineering books,\r\nsome in English and others in French, were preserved in Binan till,\r\nupon the death of his son, the family belongings were scattered. He\r\nwas wealthy, and had invested a considerable sum of money with the\r\nAmerican Manila shipping firms of Peele, Hubbell & Co., and Russell,\r\nSturgis & Co.\r\n\r\nThe family story is that he became acquainted with Brigida de Quintos,\r\nMrs. Rizal's mother, while he was a student in Manila, and that she,\r\nbeing unusually well educated for a girl of those days, helped him\r\nwith his mathematics. Their acquaintance apparently arose through\r\nrelationship, both being connected with the Reyes family. They had five\r\nchildren: Narcisa (who married Santiago Muger), Teodora (Mrs. Francisco\r\nRizal Mercado), Gregorio, Manuel and Jose. All were born in Manila,\r\nbut lived in Kalamba, and they used the name Alonzo till that general\r\nchange of names in 1850 when, with their mother, they adopted the\r\nname Realonda. This latter name has been said to be an allusion to\r\nroyal blood in the family, but other indications suggest that it\r\nmight have been a careless mistake made in writing by Rosa Realonda,\r\nwhose name sometimes appears written as Redonda. There is a family\r\nRedondo (Redonda in its feminine form) Alonzo of Ilokano origin, the\r\nsame stock as their traditions give for Mrs. Rizal's father, some\r\nof whose members were to be found in the neighborhood of Binan and\r\nPasay. One member of this family was akin in spirit to Jose Rizal,\r\nfor he was fined twenty-five thousand pesos by the Supreme Court of\r\nthe Philippine Islands for \"contempt of religion.\" It appears that he\r\nput some original comparisons into a petition which sought to obtain\r\njustice from an inferior tribunal where, by the omission of the word\r\n\"not\" in copying, the clerk had reversed the court's decision but\r\nthe judge refused to change the record.\r\n\r\nBrigida de Quintos's death record, in Kalamba (1856), speaks of her\r\nas the daughter of Manuel de Quintos and Regina Ochoa.\r\n\r\nThe most obscure part of Rizal's family tree is the Ochoa branch, the\r\nfamily of the maternal grandmother, for all the archives,--church,\r\nland and court,--disappeared during the late disturbed conditions\r\nof which Cavite was the center. So one can only repeat what has been\r\ntold by elderly people who have been found reliable in other accounts\r\nwhere the clews they gave could be compared with existing records.\r\n\r\nThe first of the family is said to have been Policarpio Ochoa, an\r\nemploye of the Spanish customs house. Estanislao Manuel Ochoa was his\r\nson, with the blood of old Castile mingling with Chinese and Tagalog\r\nin his veins. He was part owner of the Hacienda of San Francisco de\r\nMalabon. One story says that somewhere in this family was a Mariquita\r\nOchoa, of such beauty that she was known in Cavite, where was her home,\r\nas the Sampaguita (jasmine) of the Parian, or Chinese, quarter.\r\n\r\nThere was a Spanish nobleman also in Cavite in her time who had\r\nbeen deported for political reasons--probably for holding liberal\r\nopinions and for being thought to be favorable to English ideas. It\r\nis said that this particular \"caja abierta\" was a Marquis de Canete,\r\nand if so there is ground for the claim that he was of royal blood;\r\nat least some of his far-off ancestors had been related to a former\r\nruling family of Spain.\r\n\r\nMariquita's mother knew the exile, since, according to the custom\r\nin Filipino families, she looked after the business interests of her\r\nhusband. Curious to see the belle of whom he had heard so much, the\r\nMarquis made an excuse of doing business with the mother, and went to\r\nher home on an occasion when he knew that the mother was away. No one\r\nelse was there to answer his knock and Mariquita, busied in making\r\ncandy, could not in her confusion find a coconut shell to dip water\r\nfor washing her hands from the large jar, and not to keep the visitor\r\nwaiting, she answered the door as she was. Not only did her appearance\r\nrealize the expectations of the Marquis, but the girl seemed equally\r\nattractive for her self-possessed manners and lively mind. The nobleman\r\nwas charmed. On his way home he met a cart loaded with coconut dippers\r\nand he bought the entire lot and sent it as his first present.\r\n\r\nAfter this the exile invented numerous excuses to call, till\r\nMariquita's mother finally agreed to his union with her daughter. His\r\npolitical disability made him out of favor with the State church,\r\nthe only place in which people could be married then, but Mariquita\r\nbecame what in English would be called a common-law wife. One of their\r\nchildren, Jose, had a tobacco factory and a slipper factory in Meisic,\r\nManila, and was the especial protector of his younger sister, Regina,\r\nwho became the wife of attorney Manuel de Quintos. A sister of Regina\r\nwas Diega de Castro, who with another sister, Luseria, sold \"chorizos\"\r\n(sausages) or \"tiratira\" (taffy candy), the first at a store and\r\nthe second in their own home, but both in Cavite, according to the\r\nvariations of one narrative.\r\n\r\nA different account varies the time and omits the noble ancestor by\r\nsaying that Regina was married unusually young to Manuel de Quintos to\r\nescape the attentions of the Marquis. Another authority claims that\r\nRegina was wedded to the lawyer in second marriage, being the widow\r\nof Facundo de Layva, the captain of the ship Hernando Magallanes,\r\nwhose pilot, by the way, was Andrew Stewart, an Englishman.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that Regina Ochoa was of Spanish, Chinese and Tagalog\r\nancestry, and it is recorded that she was the wife of Manuel de\r\nQuintos. Here we stop depending on memories, for in the restored\r\nburial register of Kalamba church in the entry of the funeral of\r\nBrigida de Quintos she is called \"the daughter of Manuel de Quintos\r\nand Regina Ochoa.\"\r\n\r\nManuel de Quintos was an attorney of Manila, graduated from Santo Tomas\r\nUniversity, whose family were Chinese mestizos of Pangasinan. The\r\nlawyer's father, of the same name, had been municipal captain of\r\nLingayan, and an uncle was leader of the Chinese mestizos in a\r\nprotest they had made against the arbitrariness of their provincial\r\ngovernor. This petition for redress of grievances is preserved in\r\nthe Supreme Court archives with \"Joaquin de Quintos\" well and boldly\r\nwritten at the head of the complainants' names, evidence of a culture\r\nand a courage that were equally uncommon in those days. Complaints\r\nunder Spanish rule, no matter how well founded, meant trouble for the\r\ncomplainants; we must not forget that it was a vastly different thing\r\nfrom signing petitions or adhering to resolutions nowadays. Then the\r\nsigners risked certainly great annoyance, sometimes imprisonment,\r\nand not infrequently death.\r\n\r\nThe home of Quintos had been in San Pedro Macati at the time of Captain\r\nNovales's uprising, the so-called \"American revolt\" in protest against\r\nthe Peninsulars sent out to supersede the Mexican officers who had\r\nremained loyal to Spain when the colony of their birth separated\r\nitself from the mother country. As little San Pedro Macati is charged\r\nwith having originated the conspiracy, it is unlikely that it was\r\nconcealed from the liberal lawyer, for attorneys were scarcer and\r\nheld in higher esteem in those days.\r\n\r\nThe conservative element then, as later, did not often let drop\r\nany opportunity of purging the community of those who thought for\r\nthemselves, by condemning them for crime unheard and undefended,\r\nwhether they had been guilty of it or not.\r\n\r\nAll the branches of Mrs. Rizal's family were much richer than the\r\nrelatives of her husband; there were numerous lawyers and priests\r\namong them--the old-time proof of social standing--and they were\r\ninfluential in the country.\r\n\r\nThere are several names of these related families that belong among\r\nthe descendants of Lakandola, as traced by Mr. Luther Parker in\r\nhis study of the Pampangan migration, and color is thereby given,\r\nso far as Rizal is concerned, to a proud boast that an old Pampangan\r\nlady of this descent makes for her family. She, who is exceedingly\r\nwell posted upon her ancestry, ends the tracing of her lineage from\r\nLakandola's time by asserting that the blood of that chief flowed\r\nin the veins of every Filipino who had the courage to stand forward\r\nas the champion of his people from the earliest days to the close of\r\nthe Spanish regime. Lakandola, of course, belonged to the Mohammedan\r\nSumatrans who emigrated to the Philippines only a few generations\r\nbefore Magellan's discovery.\r\n\r\nTo recall relatives of Mrs. Rizal who were in the professions may\r\nhelp to an understanding of the prominence of the family. Felix\r\nFlorentino, an uncle, was the first clerk of the Nueva Segovia\r\n(Vigan) court. A cousin-german, Jose Florentino, was a Philippine\r\ndeputy in the Spanish Cortes, and a lawyer of note, as was also\r\nhis brother, Manuel. Another relative, less near, was Clerk Reyes,\r\nof the Court of First Instance in Manila. The priest of Rosario,\r\nVicar of Batangas Province, Father Leyva, was a half-blood relation,\r\nand another priestly relative was Mrs. Rizal's paternal uncle,\r\nFather Alonzo. These were in the earlier days when professional\r\nmen were scarcer. Father Almeida, of Santa Cruz Church, Manila,\r\nand Father Agustin Mendoz, his predecessor in the same church, and\r\none of the sufferers in the Cavite trouble of '72--a deporte--were\r\nmost distantly connected with the Rizal family. Another relative,\r\nof the Reyes connection, was in the Internal Revenue Service and had\r\ncharge of Kalamba during the latter part of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rizal was baptized in Santa Cruz Church, Manila, November 18,\r\n1827, as Teodora Morales Alonzo, her godmother being a relative by\r\nmarriage, Dona Maria Cristina. She was given an exceptionally good\r\nfundamental education by her gifted mother, and completed her training\r\nin Santa Rosa College, Manila, which was in the charge of Filipino\r\nsisters. Especially did the religious influence of her schooling\r\nmanifest itself in her after life. Unfortunately there are no records\r\nin the institution, because it is said all the members of the Order\r\nwho could read and write were needed for instruction and there was\r\nno one competent who had time for clerical work.\r\n\r\nBrigida de Quintos had removed to the property in Kalamba which Lorenzo\r\nAlberto had transferred to her, and there as early as 1844 she is\r\nfirst mentioned as Brigida de Quintos, then as Brigida de Alonzo,\r\nand later as Brigida Realonda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nRizal's Early Childhood\r\n\r\nJOSE PROTASIO RIZAL MERCADO Y ALONZO REALONDA, the seventh child of\r\nFrancisco Engracio Rizal Mercado y Alejandro and his wife, Teodora\r\nMorales Alonzo Realonda y Quintos, was born in Kalamba, June 19, 1861.\r\n\r\nHe was a typical Filipino, for few persons in this land of mixed\r\nblood could boast a greater mixture than his. Practically all\r\nthe ethnic elements, perhaps even the Negrito in the far past,\r\ncombined in his blood. All his ancestors, except the doubtful\r\nstrain of the Negrito, had been immigrants to the Philippines, early\r\nMalays, and later Sumatrans, Chinese of prehistoric times and the\r\nrefugees from the Tartar dominion, and Spaniards of old Castile and\r\nValencia--representatives of all the various peoples who have blended\r\nto make the strength of the Philippine race.\r\n\r\nShortly before Jose's birth his family had built a pretentious new home\r\nin the center of Kalamba on a lot which Francisco Mercado had inherited\r\nfrom his brother. The house was destroyed before its usefulness had\r\nceased, by the vindictiveness of those who hated the man-child that\r\nwas born there. And later on the gratitude of a free people held the\r\nsame spot sacred because there began that life consecrated to the\r\nPhilippines and finally given for it, after preparing the way for the\r\nunion of the various disunited Chinese mestizos, Spanish mestizos,\r\nand half a hundred dialectically distinguished \"Indians\" into the\r\nunited people of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nJose was christened in the nearby church when three days old, and as\r\ntwo out-of-town bands happened to be in Kalamba for a local festival,\r\nmusic was a feature of the event. His godfather was Father Pedro\r\nCasanas, a Filipino priest of a Kalamba family, and the priest who\r\nchristened him was also a Filipino, Father Rufino Collantes. Following\r\nis a translation of the record of Rizal's birth and baptism: \"I, the\r\nundersigned parish priest of the town of Calamba, certify that from\r\nthe investigation made with proper authority, for replacing the parish\r\nbooks which were burned September 28, 1862, to be found in Docket No. 1\r\nof Baptisms, page 49, it appears by the sworn testimony of competent\r\nwitnesses that JOSE RIZAL MERCADO is the legitimate son, and of lawful\r\nwedlock, of Don Francisco Rizal Mercado and Dona Teodora Realonda,\r\nhaving been baptized in this parish on the 22d day of June in the year\r\n1861, by the parish priest, Rev. Rufino Collantes, Rev. Pedro Casanas\r\nbeing his godfather.\"--Witness my signature. (Signed) LEONCIO LOPEZ.\r\n\r\nJose Rizal's earliest training recalls the education of William\r\nand Alexander von Humboldt, those two nineteenth century Germans\r\nwhose achievements for the prosperity of their fatherland and the\r\nadvancement of humanity have caused them to be spoken of as the most\r\nremarkable pair of brothers that ever lived. He was not physically\r\na strong child, but the direction of his first studies was by an\r\nunusually gifted mother, who succeeded, almost without the aid of\r\nbooks, in laying a foundation upon which the man placed an amount\r\nof well-mastered knowledge along many different lines that is truly\r\nmarvelous, and this was done in so short a time that its brevity\r\nconstitutes another wonder.\r\n\r\nAt three he learned his letters, having insisted upon being\r\ntaught to read and being allowed to share the lessons of an elder\r\nsister. Immediately thereafter he was discovered with her story book,\r\nspelling out its words by the aid of the syllabary or \"caton\" which\r\nhe had propped up before him and was using as one does a dictionary\r\nin a foreign language.\r\n\r\nThe little boy spent also much of his time in the church, which was\r\nconveniently near, but when the mother suggested that this might be\r\nan indication of religious inclination, his prompt response was that\r\nhe liked to watch the people.\r\n\r\nTo how good purpose the small eyes and ears were used, the true-to-life\r\ntypes of the characters in \"Noli Me Tangere\" and \"El Filibusterismo\"\r\ntestify.\r\n\r\nThree uncles, brothers of the mother, concerned themselves with\r\nthe intellectual, artistic and physical training of this promising\r\nnephew. The youngest, Jose, a teacher, looked after the regular\r\nlessons. The giant Manuel developed the physique of the youngster,\r\nuntil he had a supple body of silk and steel and was no longer a\r\nsickly lad, though he did not entirely lose his somewhat delicate\r\nlooks. The more scholarly Gregorio saw that the child earned his candy\r\nmoney--trying to instill the idea into his mind that it was not the\r\nworld's way that anything worth having should come without effort; he\r\ntaught him also the value of rapidity in work, to think for himself,\r\nand to observe carefully and to picture what he saw.\r\n\r\nSometimes Jose would draw a bird flying without lifting pencil from the\r\npaper till the picture was finished. At other times it would be a horse\r\nrunning or a dog in chase, but it always must be something of which\r\nhe had thought himself and the idea must not be overworked; there was\r\nno payment for what had been done often before. Thus he came to think\r\nfor himself, ideas were suggested to him indirectly, so he was never\r\na servile copyist, and he acquired the habit of speedy accomplishment.\r\n\r\nClay at first, then wax, was his favorite play material. From these he\r\nmodeled birds and butterflies that came ever nearer to the originals\r\nin nature as the wise praise of the uncles called his attention to\r\npossibilities of improvement and encouraged him to further effort. This\r\nwas the beginning of his nature study.\r\n\r\nJose had a pony and used to take long rides through all the surrounding\r\ncountry, so rich in picturesque scenery. Besides these horseback\r\nexpeditions were excursions afoot; on the latter his companion was\r\nhis big black dog, Usman. His father pretended to be fearful of some\r\naccident if dog and pony went together, so the boy had to choose\r\nbetween these favorites, and alternated walking and riding, just as\r\nMr. Mercado had planned he should. The long pedestrian excursions\r\nof his European life, though spoken of as German and English habits,\r\nwere merely continuations of this childhood custom. There were other\r\nplaymates besides the dog and the horse, especially doves that lived\r\nin several houses about the Mercado home, and the lad was friend\r\nand defender of all the animals, birds, and even insects in the\r\nneighborhood. Had his childish sympathies been respected the family\r\nwould have been strictly vegetarian in their diet.\r\n\r\nAt times Jose was permitted to spend the night in one of the curious\r\nlittle straw huts which La Laguna farmers put up during the harvest\r\nseason, and the myths and legends of the region which he then heard\r\ninterested him and were later made good use of in his writings.\r\n\r\nSleight-of-hand tricks were a favorite amusement, and he developed\r\na dexterity which mystified the simple folk of the country. This\r\ndiversion, and his proficiency in it, gave rise to that mysterious awe\r\nwith which he was regarded by the common people of his home region;\r\nthey ascribed to him supernatural powers, and refused to believe that\r\nhe was really dead even after the tragedy of Bagumbayan.\r\n\r\nEntertainment of the neighbors with magic-lantern exhibitions was\r\nanother frequent amusement, an ordinary lamp throwing its light on\r\na common sheet serving as a screen. Jose's supple fingers twisted\r\nthemselves into fantastic shapes, the enlarged shadows of which on\r\nthe curtain bore resemblance to animals, and paper accessories were\r\nworked in to vary and enlarge the repertoire of action figures. The\r\nyouthful showman was quite successful in catering to the public taste,\r\nand the knowledge he then gained proved valuable later in enabling\r\nhim to approach his countrymen with books that held their attention\r\nand gave him the opportunity to tell them of shortcomings which it\r\nwas necessary that they should correct.\r\n\r\nAlmost from babyhood he had a grown-up way about him, a sort of dignity\r\nthat seemed to make him realize and respect the rights of others and\r\nunconsciously disposed his elders to reason with him, rather than scold\r\nhim for his slight offenses. This habit grew, as reprimands were needed\r\nbut once, and his grave promises of better behavior were faithfully\r\nkept when the explanation of why his conduct was wrong was once made\r\nclear to him. So the child came to be not an unwelcome companion even\r\nfor adults, for he respected their moods and was never troublesome. A\r\nbig influence in the formation of the child's character was his\r\nassociation with the parish priest of Kalamba, Father Leoncio Lopez.\r\n\r\nThe Kalamba church and convento, which were located across the way\r\nfrom the Rizal home, were constructed after the great earthquake of\r\n1863, which demolished so many edifices throughout the central part\r\nof the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe curate of Kalamba had a strong personality and was notable\r\namong the Filipino secular clergy of that day when responsibility\r\nhad developed many creditable figures. An English writer of long\r\nresidence in the Philippines, John Foreman, in his book on the\r\nPhilippine Islands, describes how his first meeting with this priest\r\nimpressed him, and tells us that subsequent acquaintance confirmed\r\nthe early favorable opinion of one whom he considered remarkable for\r\nbroad intelligence and sanity of view. Father Leoncio never deceived\r\nhimself and his judgment was sound and clear, even when against\r\nthe opinions and persons of whom he would have preferred to think\r\ndifferently. Probably Jose, through the priest's fondness for children\r\nand because he was well behaved and the son of friendly neighbors,\r\nwas at first tolerated about the convento, the Philippine name for\r\nthe priest's residence, but soon he became a welcome visitor for his\r\nown sake.\r\n\r\nHe never disturbed the priest's meditations when the old clergyman\r\nwas studying out some difficult question, but was a keen observer,\r\napparently none the less curious for his respectful reserve. Father\r\nLeoncio may have forgotten the age of his listener, or possibly was\r\nonly thinking aloud, but he spoke of those matters which interested\r\nall thinking Filipinos and found a sympathetic, eager audience in\r\nthe little boy, who at least gave close heed if he had at first no\r\nvaluable comments to offer.\r\n\r\nIn time the child came to ask questions, and they were so sensible\r\nthat careful explanation was given, and questions were not dismissed\r\nwith the statement that these things were for grown-ups, a statement\r\nwhich so often repels the childish zeal for knowledge. Not many\r\nmature people in those days held so serious converse as the priest\r\nand his child friend, for fear of being overheard and reported,\r\na danger which even then existed in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThat the old Filipino priest of Rizal's novels owed something to the\r\nauthor's recollections of Father Leoncio is suggested by a chapter in\r\n\"Noli Me Tangere.\" Ibarra, viewing Manila by moonlight on the first\r\nnight after his return from Europe, recalls old memories and makes\r\nmention of the neighborhood of the Botanical Garden, just beyond\r\nwhich the friend and mentor of his youth had died. Father Leoncio\r\nLopez died in Calle Concepcion in that vicinity, which would seem to\r\nidentify him in connection with that scene in the book, rather than\r\nnumerous others whose names have been sometimes suggested.\r\n\r\nTwo writings of Rizal recall thoughts of his youthful days. One tells\r\nhow he used to wander down along the lake shore and, looking across\r\nthe waters, wonder about the people on the other side. Did they,\r\ntoo, he questioned, suffer injustice as the people of his home town\r\ndid? Was the whip there used as freely, carelessly and unmercifully by\r\nthe authorities? Had men and women also to be servile and hypocrites\r\nto live in peace over there? But among these thoughts, never once\r\ndid it occur to him that at no distant day the conditions would be\r\nchanged and, under a government that safeguarded the personal rights\r\nof the humblest of its citizens, the region that evoked his childhood\r\nwondering was to become part of a province bearing his own name in\r\nhonor of his labors toward banishing servility and hypocrisy from\r\nthe character of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe lake district of Central Luzon is one of the most historic regions\r\nin the Islands, the May-i probably of the twelfth century Chinese\r\ngeographer. Here was the scene of the earliest Spanish missionary\r\nactivity. On the south shore is Kalamba, birthplace of Doctor Rizal,\r\nwith Binan, the residence of his father's ancestors, to the northwest,\r\nand on the north shore the land to which reference is made above. Today\r\nthis same region at the north bears the name of Rizal Province in\r\nhis honor.\r\n\r\nThe other recollection of Rizal's youth is of his first reading\r\nlesson. He did not know Spanish and made bad work of the story of the\r\n\"Foolish Butterfly,\" which his mother had selected, stumbling over the\r\nwords and grouping them without regard to the sense. Finally Mrs. Rizal\r\ntook the book from her son and read it herself, translating the tale\r\ninto the familiar Tagalog used in their home. The moral is supposed\r\nto be obedience, and the young butterfly was burned and died because\r\nit disregarded the parental warning not to venture too close to the\r\nalluring flame. The reading lesson was in the evening and by the\r\nlight of a coconut-oil lamp, and some moths were very appropriately\r\nfluttering about its cheerful blaze. The little boy watched them as\r\nhis mother read and he missed the moral, for as the insects singed\r\ntheir wings and fluttered to their death in the flame he forgot\r\ntheir disobedience and found no warning in it for him. Rather he\r\nenvied their fate and considered that the light was so fine a thing\r\nthat it was worth dying for. Thus early did the notion that there\r\nare things worth more than life enter his head, though he could not\r\nforesee that he was to be himself a martyr and that the day of his\r\ndeath would before long be commemorated in his country to recall to\r\nhis countrymen lessons as important to their national existence as\r\nhis mother's precept was for his childish welfare.\r\n\r\nWhen he was four the mystery of life's ending had been brought home to\r\nhim by the death of a favorite little sister, and he shed the first\r\ntears of real sorrow, for until then he had only wept as children do\r\nwhen disappointed in getting their own way. It was the first of many\r\ngriefs, but he quickly realized that life is a constant struggle and\r\nhe learned to meet disappointments and sorrows with the tears in the\r\nheart and a smile on the lips, as he once advised a nephew to do.\r\n\r\nAt seven Jose made his first real journey; the family went to Antipolo\r\nwith the host of pilgrims who in May visit the mountain shrine of Our\r\nLady of Peace and Safe Travel. In the early Spanish days in Mexico\r\nshe was the special patroness of voyages to America, especially while\r\nthe galleon trade lasted; the statue was brought to Antipolo in 1672.\r\n\r\nA print of the Virgin, a souvenir of this pilgrimage, was, according\r\nto the custom of those times, pasted inside Jose's wooden chest when\r\nhe left home for school; later on it was preserved in an album and\r\nwent with him in all his travels. Afterwards it faced Bougereau's\r\nsplendid conception of the Christ-mother, as one who had herself\r\nthus suffered, consoling another mother grieving over the loss of a\r\nson. Many years afterwards Doctor Rizal was charged with having fallen\r\naway from religion, but he seems really rather to have experienced a\r\ndeepening of the religious spirit which made the essentials of charity\r\nand kindness more important in his eyes than forms and ceremonies.\r\n\r\nYet Rizal practiced those forms prescribed for the individual even\r\nwhen debarred from church privileges. The lad doubtless got his\r\nidea of distinguishing between the sign and the substance from a\r\nwell-worn book of explanations of the church ritual and symbolism\r\n\"intended for the use of parish priests.\" It was found in his library,\r\nwith Mrs. Rizal's name on the flyleaf. Much did he owe his mother,\r\nand his grateful recognition appears in his appreciative portrayal\r\nof maternal affection in his novels.\r\n\r\nHis parents were both religious, but in a different way. The father's\r\nreligion was manifested in his charities; he used to keep on hand\r\na fund, of which his wife had no account, for contributions to the\r\nnecessitous and loans to the irresponsible. Mrs. Rizal attended to\r\nthe business affairs and was more careful in her handling of money,\r\nthough quite as charitably disposed. Her early training in Santa\r\nRosa had taught her the habit of frequent prayer and she began early\r\nin the morning and continued till late in the evening, with frequent\r\nattendance in the church. Mr. Rizal did not forget his church duties,\r\nbut was far from being so assiduous in his practice of them, and the\r\ndiscussions in the home frequently turned on the comparative value of\r\nwords and deeds, discussions that were often given a humorous twist\r\nby the husband when he contrasted his wife's liberality in prayers\r\nwith her more careful dispensing of money aid.\r\n\r\nNot many homes in Kalamba were so well posted on events of the outside\r\nworld, and the children constantly heard discussions of questions\r\nwhich other households either ignored or treated rather reservedly, for\r\nespionage was rampant even then in the Islands. Mrs. Rizal's literary\r\ntraining had given her an acquaintance with the better Spanish writers\r\nwhich benefited her children; she told them the classic tales in style\r\nadapted to their childish comprehension, so that when they grew older\r\nthey found that many noted authors were old acquaintances. The Bible,\r\ntoo, played a large part in the home. Mrs. Rizal's copy was a Spanish\r\ntranslation of the Latin Vulgate, the version authorized by her Church\r\nbut not common in the Islands then. Rizal's frequent references to\r\nBiblical personages and incidents are not paralleled in the writings\r\nof any contemporary Filipino author.\r\n\r\nThe frequent visitors to their home, the church, civil and military\r\nauthorities, who found the spacious Rizal mansion a convenient resting\r\nplace on their way to the health resort at Los Banos, brought something\r\nof the city, and a something not found by many residents even there, to\r\nthe people of this village household. Oftentimes the house was filled,\r\nand the family would not turn away a guest of less rank for the sake of\r\none of higher distinction, though that unsocial practice was frequently\r\nfollowed by persons who forgot their self-respect in toadying to rank.\r\n\r\nLittle Jose did not know Spanish very well, so far as conversational\r\nusage was concerned, but his mother tried to impress on him the beauty\r\nof the Spanish poets and encouraged him in essays at rhyming which\r\nfinally grew into quite respectable poetical compositions. One of\r\nthese was a drama in Tagalog which so pleased a municipal captain of\r\nthe neighboring village of Paete, who happened to hear it while on\r\na visit to Kalamba, that the youthful author was paid two pesos for\r\nthe production. This was as much money as a field laborer in those\r\ndays would have earned in half a month; although the family did not\r\nneed the coin, the incident impressed them with the desirability of\r\ncultivating the boy's talent.\r\n\r\nJose was nine years old when he was sent to study in Binan. His master\r\nthere, Justiniano Aquino Cruz, was of the old school and Rizal has left\r\na record of some of his maxims, such as \"Spare the rod and spoil the\r\nchild,\" \"The letter enters with blood,\" and other similar indications\r\nof his heroic treatment of the unfortunates under his care. However,\r\nif he was a strict disciplinarian, Master Justiniano was also a\r\nconscientious instructor, and the boy had been only a few months\r\nunder his care when the pupil was told that he knew as much as his\r\nmaster, and had better go to Manila to school. Truthful Jose repeated\r\nthis conversation without the modification which modesty might have\r\nsuggested, and his father responded rather vigorously to the idea\r\nand it was intimated that in the father's childhood pupils were not\r\naccustomed to say that they knew as much as their teachers. However,\r\nMaster Justiniano corroborated the child's statement, so that\r\npreparations for Jose's going to Manila began to be made. This was\r\nin the Christmas vacation of 1871.\r\n\r\nBinan had been a valuable experience for young Rizal. There he had\r\nmet a host of relatives and from them heard much of the past of his\r\nfather's family. His maternal grandfather's great house was there, now\r\ninhabited by his mother's half-brother, a most interesting personage.\r\n\r\nThis uncle, Jose Alberto, had been educated in British India, spending\r\neleven years in a Calcutta missionary school. This was the result of\r\nan acquaintance which his father had made with an English naval officer\r\nwho visited the Philippines about 1820, the author of \"An Englishman's\r\nVisit to the Philippines.\" Lorenzo Alberto, the grandfather, himself\r\nspoke English and had English associations. He had also liberal ideas\r\nand preferred the system under which the Philippines were represented\r\nin the Cortes and were treated not as a colony but as part of the\r\nhomeland and its people were considered Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThe great Binan bridge had been built under Lorenzo Alberto's\r\nsupervision, and for services to the Spanish nation during the\r\nexpedition to Cochin-China--probably liberal contributions of money--he\r\nhad been granted the title of Knight of the American Order of Isabel\r\nthe Catholic, but by the time this recognition reached him he had died,\r\nand the patent was made out to his son.\r\n\r\nAn episode well known in the village--its chief event, if one might\r\njudge from the conversation of the inhabitants--was a visit which\r\na governor of Hongkong had made there when he was a guest in the\r\nhome of Alberto. Many were the tales told of this distinguished\r\nEnglishman, who was Sir John Bowring, the notable polyglot and\r\ntranslator into English of poetry in practically every one of the\r\ndialects of Europe. His achievements along this line had put him\r\nsecond or third among the linguists of the century. He was also\r\ninterested in history, and mentioned in his Binan visit that the\r\nHakluyt Society, of which he was a Director, was then preparing to\r\npublish an exceedingly interesting account of the early Philippines\r\nthat did more justice to its inhabitants than the regular Spanish\r\nhistorians. Here Rizal first heard of Morga, the historian, whose\r\nbook he in after years made accessible to his countrymen. A desire\r\nto know other languages than his own also possessed him and he was\r\neager to rival the achievements of Sir John Bowring.\r\n\r\nIn his book entitled \"A Visit to the Philippine Islands,\" which was\r\ntranslated into Spanish by Mr. Jose del Pan, a liberal editor of\r\nManila, Sir John Bowring gives the following account of his visit to\r\nRizal's uncle:\r\n\r\n\"We reached Binan before sunset .... First we passed between\r\nfiles of youths, then of maidens; and through a triumphal\r\narch we reached the handsome dwelling of a rich mestizo, whom\r\nwe found decorated with a Spanish order, which had been granted\r\nto his father before him. He spoke English, having been educated\r\nat Calcutta, and his house--a very large one--gave abundant\r\nevidence that he had not studied in vain the arts of domestic\r\ncivilization. The furniture, the beds, the table, the cookery, were\r\nall in good taste, and the obvious sincerity of the kind reception\r\nadded to its agreeableness. Great crowds were gathered together\r\nin the square which fronts the house of Don Jose Alberto.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Philippines had just had a liberal governor, De la Torte, but even\r\nduring this period of apparent liberalness there existed a confidential\r\ngovernment order directing that all letters from Filipinos suspected\r\nof progressive ideas were to be opened in the post. This violation\r\nof the mails furnished the list of those who later suffered in the\r\nconvenient insurrection of '72.\r\n\r\nAn agrarian trouble, the old disagreement between landlords and\r\ntenants, had culminated in an active outbreak which the government\r\nwas unable to put down, and so it made terms by which, among other\r\nthings, the leader of the insurrection was established as chief\r\nof a new civil guard for the purpose of keeping order. Here again\r\nwas another preparation for '72, for at that time the agreement\r\nwas forgotten and the officer suffered punishment, in spite of the\r\nimmunity he had been promised.\r\n\r\nReligious troubles, too, were rife. The Jesuits had returned from\r\nexile shortly before, and were restricted to teaching work in those\r\nparishes in the missionary district where collections were few and\r\ndanger was great. To make room for those whom they displaced the better\r\nparishes in the more thickly settled regions were taken from Filipino\r\npriests and turned over to members of the religious Orders. Naturally\r\nthere was discontent. A confidential communication from the secular\r\narchbishop, Doctor Martinez, shows that he considered the Filipinos had\r\nground for complaint, for he states that if the Filipinos were under a\r\nnon-Catholic government like that of England they would receive fairer\r\ntreatment than they were getting from their Spanish co-religionaries,\r\nand warns the home government that trouble will inevitably result if\r\nthe discrimination against the natives of the country is continued.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit method of education in their newly established \"Ateneo\r\nMunicipal\" was a change from that in the former schools. It treated the\r\nFilipino as a Spaniard and made no distinctions between the races in\r\nthe school dormitory. In the older institutions of Manila the Spanish\r\nstudents lived in the Spanish way and spoke their own language, but\r\nFilipinos were required to talk Latin, sleep on floor mats and eat\r\nwith their hands from low tables. These Filipino customs obtained in\r\nthe hamlets, but did not appeal to city lads who had become used to\r\nSpanish ways in their own homes and objected to departing from them in\r\nschool. The disaffection thus created was among the educated class,\r\nwho were best fitted to be leaders of their people in any dangerous\r\ninsurrection against the government.\r\n\r\nHowever, a change had to take place to meet the Jesuit competition,\r\nand in the rearrangement Filipino professors were given a larger\r\nshare in the management of the schools. Notable among these was\r\nFather Burgos. He had earned his doctor's degree in two separate\r\ncourses, was among the best educated in the capital and by far the\r\nmost public-spirited and valiant of the Filipino priests.\r\n\r\nHe enlisted the interest of many of the older Filipino clergy and\r\nthrough their contributions subsidized a paper, El Eco Filipino,\r\nwhich spoke from the Filipino standpoint and answered the reflections\r\nwhich were the stock in trade of the conservative organ, for the\r\nreactionaries had an abusive journal just as they had had in 1821\r\nand were to have in the later days.\r\n\r\nSuch were the conditions when Jose Rizal got ready to leave home for\r\nschool in Manila, a departure which was delayed by the misfortunes of\r\nhis mother. His only, and elder, brother, Paciano, had been a student\r\nin San Jose College in Manila for some years, and had regularly failed\r\nin passing his examinations because of his outspokenness against\r\nthe evils of the country. Paciano was a great favorite with Doctor\r\nBurgos, in whose home he lived and for whom he acted as messenger\r\nand go-between in the delicate negotiations of the propaganda which\r\nthe doctor was carrying on.\r\n\r\nIn February of '72 all the dreams of a brighter and freer Philippines\r\nwere crushed out in that enormous injustice which made the mutiny of a\r\nfew soldiers and arsenal employes in Cavite the excuse for deporting,\r\nimprisoning, and even shooting those whose correspondence, opened\r\nduring the previous year, had shown them to be discontented with the\r\nbackward conditions in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nDoctor Burgos, just as he had been nominated to a higher post in the\r\nChurch, was the chief victim. Father Gomez, an old man, noted for\r\ncharity, was another, and the third was Father Zamora. A reference\r\nin a letter of his to \"powder,\" which was his way of saying money,\r\nwas distorted into a dangerous significance, in spite of the fact\r\nthat the letter was merely an invitation to a gambling game. The\r\ntrial was a farce, the informer was garroted just when he was on\r\nthe point of complaining that he was not receiving the pardon and\r\npayment which he had been promised for his services in convicting\r\nthe others. The whole affair had an ugly look, and the way it was\r\nhushed up did not add to the confidence of the people in the justice\r\nof the proceedings. The Islands were then placed under military law\r\nand remained so for many years.\r\n\r\nFather Burgos's dying advice to Filipinos was for them to be educated\r\nabroad, preferably outside of Spain, but if they could do no better,\r\nat least go to the Peninsula. He urged that through education only\r\ncould progress be hoped for. In one of his speeches he had warned the\r\nSpanish government that continued oppressive measures would drive the\r\nFilipinos from their allegiance and make them wish to become subjects\r\nof a freer power, suggesting England, whose possessions surrounded\r\nthe Islands.\r\n\r\nDoctor Burgos's idea of England as a hope for the Philippines was\r\nborne out by the interest which the British newspapers of Hongkong\r\ntook in Philippine affairs. They gave accounts of the troubles and\r\npicked flaws in the garbled reports which the officials sent abroad.\r\n\r\nSome zealous but unthinking reactionary at this time conceived the idea\r\nof publishing a book somewhat similar to that which had been gotten\r\nout against the Constitution of Cadiz. \"Captain Juan\" was its name;\r\nit was in catechism form, and told of an old municipal captain who\r\ndeserved to be honored because he was so submissively subservient to\r\nall constituted authority. He tries to distinguish between different\r\nkinds of liberty, and the especial attention which he devotes to\r\nAmerica shows how live a topic the great republic was at that time in\r\nthe Islands. This interest is explained by the fact that an American\r\ncompany had just then received a grant of the northern part of Borneo,\r\nlater British North Borneo, for a trading company. It was believed that\r\nthe United States had designs on the Archipelago because of treaties\r\nwhich had been negotiated with the Sultan of Sulu and certain American\r\ncommercial interests in the Far East, which were then rather important.\r\n\r\nAmericans, too, had become known in the Philippines through a soldier\r\nof fortune who had helped out the Chinese government in suppressing\r\nthe rebellion in the neighborhood of Shanghai. \"General\" F. T. Ward,\r\nfrom Massachusetts, organized an army of deserters from European ships,\r\nbut their lack of discipline made them undesirable soldiers, and so\r\nhe disbanded the force. He then gathered a regiment of Manila men,\r\nas the Filipinos usually found as quartermasters on all ships sailing\r\nin the East were then called. With the aid of some other Americans\r\nthese troops were disciplined and drilled into such efficiency that the\r\nmen came to have the title among the Chinese of the \"Ever-Victorious\"\r\narmy, because of the almost unbroken series of successes which they\r\nhad experienced. A partial explanation, possibly, of their fighting\r\nso well is that they were paid only when they won.\r\n\r\nThe high praise given the Filipinos at this time was in contrast to the\r\ndisparagement made of their efforts in Indo-China, where in reality\r\nthey had done the fighting rather than their Spanish officers. When\r\na Spaniard in the Philippines quoted of the Filipino their customary\r\nsaying, \"Poor soldier, worse sacristan,\" the Filipinos dared make\r\nno open reply, but they consoled themselves with remembering the\r\nflattering comments of \"General\" Ward and the favorable opinion of\r\nArchbishop Martinez.\r\n\r\nReferences to Filipino military capacity were banned by the censors and\r\nthe archbishop's communication had been confidential, but both became\r\nknown, for despotisms drive its victims to stealth and to methods\r\nwhich would not be considered creditable under freer conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nJagor's Prophecy\r\n\r\nRIZAL'S first home in Manila was in a nipa house with Manuel\r\nHidalgo, later to be his brother-in-law, in Calle Espeleta, a street\r\nnamed for a former Filipino priest who had risen to be bishop and\r\ngovernor-general. This spot is now marked with a tablet which gives\r\nthe date of his coming as the latter part of February, 1872.\r\n\r\nRizal's own recollections speak of June as being the date of the\r\nformal beginning of his studies in Manila. First he went to San Juan\r\nde Letran and took an examination in the Catechism. Then he went back\r\nto Kalamba and in July passed into the Ateneo, possibly because of\r\nthe more favorable conditions under which the pupils were admitted,\r\nreceiving credit for work in arithmetic, which in the other school,\r\nit is said, he would have had to restudy. This perhaps accounts for\r\nthe credit shown in the scholastic year 1871-72. Until his fourth\r\nyear Rizal was an externe, as those residing outside of the school\r\ndormitory were then called. The Ateneo was very popular and so great\r\nwas the eagerness to enter it that the waiting list was long and two\r\nor three years' delay was not at all uncommon.\r\n\r\nThere is a little uncertainty about this period; some writers have\r\ngone so far as to give recollections of childhood incidents of which\r\nRizal was the hero while he lived in the house of Doctor Burgos,\r\nbut the family deny that he was ever in this home, and say that he\r\nhas been confused with his brother Paciano.\r\n\r\nThe greatest influence upon Rizal during this period was the sense of\r\nSpanish judicial injustice in the legal persecutions of his mother,\r\nwho, though innocent, for two years was treated as a criminal and\r\nheld in prison.\r\n\r\nMuch of the story is not necessary for this narrative, but the mother's\r\ntroubles had their beginning in the attempted revenge of a lieutenant\r\nof the Civil Guard, one of a body of Spaniards who were no credit\r\nto the mother country and whom Rizal never lost opportunity in his\r\nwritings of painting in their true colors. This official had been in\r\nthe habit of having his horse fed at the Mercado home when he visited\r\ntheir town from his station in Binan, but once there was a scarcity\r\nof fodder and Mr. Mercado insisted that his own stock was entitled\r\nto care before he could extend hospitality to strangers. This the\r\nofficial bitterly resented. His opportunity for revenge soon came, and\r\nwas not overlooked. A disagreement between Jose Alberto, the mother's\r\nbrother in Binan, and his wife, also his cousin, to whom he had been\r\nmarried when they were both quite young, led to sensational charges\r\nwhich a discreet officer would have investigated and would assuredly\r\nhave then realized to be unfounded. Instead the lieutenant accepted\r\nthe most ridiculous statements, brought charges of attempted murder\r\nagainst Alberto and his sister, Mrs. Rizal, and evidently figured\r\nthat he would be able to extort money from the rich man and gratify\r\nhis revenge at the same time.\r\n\r\nNow comes a disgruntled judge, who had not received the attention at\r\nthe Mercado home which he thought his dignity demanded. Out of revenge\r\nhe ordered Mrs. Rizal to be conducted at once to the provincial prison,\r\nnot in the usual way by boat, but, to cause her greater annoyance,\r\nafoot around the lake. It was a long journey from Kalamba to Santa\r\nCruz, and the first evening the guard and his prisoner came to\r\na village where there was a festival in progress. Mrs. Rizal was\r\nwell known and was welcomed in the home of one of the prominent\r\nfamilies. The festivities were at their height when the judge, who\r\nhad been on horseback and so had reached the town earlier, heard that\r\nthe prisoner, instead of being in the village calaboose, was a guest\r\nof honor and apparently not suffering the annoyance to which he had\r\nintended to subject her. He strode to the house, and, not content to\r\nknock, broke in the door, splintered his cane on the poor constable's\r\nhead, and then exhausted himself beating the owner of the house.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings were revealed in a charge of prejudice which\r\nMrs. Rizal's lawyers urged against the judge who at the same time\r\nwas the one who decided the case and also the prosecutor. The Supreme\r\nCourt agreed that her contention was correct and directed that she be\r\ndischarged from custody. To this order the judge paid due respect and\r\nordered her release, but he said that the accusation of unfairness\r\nagainst him was contempt of court, and gave her a longer sentence\r\nunder this charge than the previous one from which she had just been\r\nabsolved. After some delay the Supreme Court heard of this affair and\r\ndecided that the judge was right. But, because Mrs. Rizal had been\r\nlonger in prison awaiting trial than the sentence, they dated back\r\nher imprisonment, and again ordered her release. Here the record\r\ngets a little confused because it is concerned with a story that\r\nher brother had sixteen thousand pesos concealed in his cell, and\r\neverybody, from the Supreme Court down, seemed interested in trying\r\nto locate the money.\r\n\r\nWhile the officials were looking for his sack of gold, Alberto\r\ngave a power of attorney to an overintelligent lawyer who worded\r\nhis authority so that it gave him the right to do everything\r\nwhich his principal himself could have done \"personally, legally\r\nand ecclesiastically.\" From some source outside, but not from the\r\nbrother, the attorney heard that Mrs. Rizal had had money belonging\r\nto Alberto, for in the extensive sugar-purchasing business which she\r\ncarried on she handled large sums and frequently borrowed as much as\r\nfive thousand pesos from this brother. Anxious to get his hands on\r\nmoney, he instituted a charge of theft against her, under his power of\r\nattorney and acting in the name of his principal. Mrs. Rizal's attorney\r\ndemurred to such a charge being made without the man who had lent the\r\nmoney being at all consulted, and held that a power of attorney did\r\nnot warrant such an action. In time the intelligent Supreme Court\r\nheard this case and decided that it should go to trial; but later,\r\nwhen the attorney, acting for his principal, wanted to testify for him\r\nunder the power of attorney, they seem to have reached their limit,\r\nfor they disapproved of that proposal.\r\n\r\nAnyone who cares to know just how ridiculous and inconsistent the\r\njudicial system of the Philippines then was would do well to try to\r\nunravel the mixed details of the half dozen charges, ranging from\r\ncruelty through theft to murder, which were made against Mrs. Rizal\r\nwithout a shadow of evidence. One case was trumped up as soon as\r\nanother was finished, and possibly the affair would have dragged on\r\ntill the end of the Spanish administration had not her little daughter\r\ndanced before the Governor-General once when he was traveling through\r\nthe country, won his approval, and when he asked what favor he could do\r\nfor her, presented a petition for her mother's release. In this way,\r\nwhich recalls the customs of primitive nations, Mrs. Rizal finally\r\nwas enabled to return to her home.\r\n\r\nDoctor Rizal tells us that it was then that he first began to lose\r\nconfidence in mankind. A story of a school companion, that when\r\nRizal recalled this incident the red came into his eyes, probably\r\nhas about the same foundation as the frequent stories of his weeping\r\nwith emotion upon other people's shoulders when advised of momentous\r\nchanges in his life. Doctor Rizal did not have these Spanish ways,\r\nand the narrators are merely speaking of what other Spaniards would\r\nhave done, for self-restraint and freedom from exhibitions of emotion\r\nwere among his most prominent characteristics.\r\n\r\nSome time during Rizal's early years of school came his first success\r\nin painting. It was the occasion of a festival in Kalamba; just at\r\nthe last moment an important banner was accidentally damaged and there\r\nwas not time to send to Manila for another. A hasty consultation was\r\nheld among the village authorities, and one councilman suggested that\r\nJose Rizal had shown considerable skill with the brush and possibly he\r\ncould paint something that would pass. The gobernadorcillo proceeded to\r\nthe lad's home and explained the need. Rizal promptly went to work,\r\nunder the official's direction, and speedily produced a painting\r\nwhich the delighted municipal executive declared was better than the\r\nexpensive banner bought in Manila. The achievement was explained to\r\nall the participants in the festival and young Jose was the hero of\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\nDuring intervals of school work Rizal found time to continue his\r\nmodeling in clay which he procured from the brickyard of a cousin at\r\nSan Pedro Macati.\r\n\r\nRizal's uncle, Jose Alberto, had played a considerable part in his\r\npolitical education. He was influential with the Regency in Spain,\r\nwhich succeeded Queen Isabel when that sovereign became too malodorous\r\nto be longer tolerated, and he was the personal friend of the Regent,\r\nGeneral Prim, whose motto, \"More liberal today than yesterday, more\r\nliberal tomorrow than today,\" he was fond of quoting. He was present in\r\nMadrid at the time of General Prim's assassination and often told of\r\nhow this wise patriot, recognizing the unpreparedness of the Spanish\r\npeople for a republic, opposed the efforts for what would, he knew,\r\nresult in as disastrous a failure as had been France's first effort,\r\nand how he lost his life through his desire to follow the safer\r\ncourse of proceeding gradually through the preparatory stage of a\r\nconstitutional monarchy. Alberto was made by him a Knight of the Order\r\nof Carlos III, and, after Prim's death, was created by King Amadeo a\r\nKnight Commander, the step higher in the Order of Isabel the Catholic.\r\n\r\nEvents proved Prim's wisdom, as Alberto was careful to observe, for\r\nKing Amadeo was soon convinced of the unfitness of his people for even\r\na constitutional monarchy, told them so, resigned his throne, and bade\r\nthem farewell. Then came a republic marked by excesses such as even\r\nthe worst monarch had not committed; among them the dreadful massacre\r\nof the members of the filibustering party on the steamer Virginius\r\nin Cuba, which would have caused war with the United States had not\r\nthe Americans been deluded into the idea that they were dealing with\r\na sister republic. America and Switzerland had been the only nations\r\nwhich had recognized Spain's new form of government. Prim sought an\r\nalliance with America, for he claimed that Spain should be linked\r\nwith a country which would buy Spanish goods and to which Spain could\r\nsend her products. France, with whom the Bourbons wished to be allied,\r\nwas a competitor along Spain's own lines.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier disturbances in Spain a party of Carlists were\r\nsent to the Philippine Islands; they were welcomed by the reactionary\r\nSpaniards, for devotion to King Carlos had been their characteristic\r\never since the days when Queen Isabel had taken the throne that in\r\ntheir opinion belonged to the heir in the male line. Rizal frequently\r\nmakes mention of this disloyalty to the ruler of Spain on the part\r\nof those who claimed to be most devoted Spaniards.\r\n\r\nAlong with the stories of these troubles which Rizal heard during his\r\nschool days in Manila were reports of how these exiles had established\r\nthemselves in foreign cities, Basa in Hongkong, Regidor in London,\r\nand Tavera in Paris. At their homes in these cities they gave a warm\r\nwelcome to such Filipinos as traveled abroad and they were always ready\r\nto act as guardians for Filipino students who wished to study in their\r\ncities, Many availed themselves of these opportunities and it came to\r\nbe an ambition among those in the Islands to get an education which\r\nthey believed was better than that which Spain afforded. There was some\r\nground for such a belief, because many of the most prominent successful\r\nmen of Spanish and Philippine birth were men whose education had been\r\nforeign. A well-known instance in Manila was the architect Roxas,\r\nfather of the present Alcalde of Manila, who learned his profession\r\nin England and was almost the only notable builder in Manila during\r\nhis lifetime.\r\n\r\nPaciano Rizal, Jose's elder brother, had retired from Manila on the\r\ndeath of Doctor Burgos and devoted himself to farming; in some ways,\r\nperhaps, his career suggested the character of Tasio, the philosopher\r\nof \"Noli Me Tangere.\" He was careful to see that his younger brother\r\nwas familiar with the liberal literature with which he had become\r\nacquainted through Doctor Burgos.\r\n\r\nThe first foreign book read by Rizal, in a Spanish translation,\r\nwas Dumas's great novel, \"The Count of Monte Cristo,\" and the story\r\nof the wrongs suffered by the prisoner of the Chateau d'If recalled\r\nthe injustice done his mother. Then came the book which had greatest\r\ninfluence upon the young man's career; this was a Spanish translation\r\nof Jagor's \"Travels in the Philippines,\" the observations of a German\r\nnaturalist who had visited the Islands some fifteen years before. This\r\nlatter book, among other comments, suggested that it was the fate of\r\nthe North American republic to develop and bring to their highest\r\nprosperity the lands which Spain had conquered and Christianized\r\nwith sword and cross. Sooner or later, this German writer believed,\r\nthe Philippine Islands could no more escape this American influence\r\nthan had the countries on the mainland, and expressed the hope that\r\none day the Philippines would succumb to the same influence; he felt,\r\nhowever, that it was desirable first for the Islanders to become better\r\nable to meet the strong competition of the vigorous young people of the\r\nNew World, for under Spain the Philippines had dreamed away its past.\r\n\r\nThe exact title of the book is \"Travels | in the | Philippines. |\r\nBy F. Jagor. | With numerous illustrations and a Map | London: |\r\nChapman and Hall, 193, Piccadilly. | 1875.\" The title of the Spanish\r\ntranslation reads, \"Viajes | por | Filipinas | de F. Jagor | Traducidos\r\ndel Aleman | por S. Vidal y Soler | Ingeniero de Montes | Edicion\r\nillustrada con numerosos grabados | Madrid: Imprenta, Estereopidea\r\ny Galvanoplastia de Ariban y Ca. | (Sucesores de Rivadencyra) |\r\nImpresores de Camara de S. M. | Calle del Duque de Osuna, num 3. 1875,\"\r\nThe following extract from the book will show how marvelously the\r\nauthor anticipated events that have now become history:\r\n\r\n\"With the altered condition of things, however, all this has\r\ndisappeared. The colony can no longer be kept secluded from the\r\nworld. Every facility afforded for commercial intercourse is a blow\r\nto the old system, and a great step made in the direction of broad\r\nand liberal reforms. The more foreign capital and foreign ideas and\r\ncustoms are introduced, increasing the prosperity, enlightenment,\r\nand self-esteem of the population, the more impatiently will the\r\nexisting evils be endured.\r\n\r\nEngland can and does open her possessions unconcernedly to the\r\nworld. The British colonies are united to the mother country by\r\nthe bond of mutual advantage, viz., the produce of raw material by\r\nmeans of English capital, and the exchange of the same for English\r\nmanufactures. The wealth of England is so great, the organization of\r\nher commerce with the world so complete, that nearly all the foreigners\r\neven in the British possessions are for the most part agents for\r\nEnglish business houses, which would scarcely be affected, at least\r\nto any marked extent, by a political dismemberment. It is entirely\r\ndifferent with Spain, which possesses the colony as an inherited\r\nproperty, and without the power of turning it to any useful account.\r\n\r\nGovernment monopolies rigorously maintained, insolent disregard and\r\nneglect of the half-castes and powerful creoles, and the example\r\nof the United States, were the chief reasons of the downfall of the\r\nAmerican possessions. The same causes threaten ruin to the Philippines;\r\nbut of the monopolies I have said enough.\r\n\r\nHalf-castes and creoles, it is true are not, as they formerly were\r\nin America, excluded from all orificial appointments; but they feel\r\ndeeply hurt and injured through the crowds of place-hunters which\r\nthe frequent changes of Ministers send to Manilla. The influence,\r\nalso, of the American element is at least visible on the horizon,\r\nand will be more noticeable when the relations increase between the\r\ntwo countries. At present they are very slender. The trade in the\r\nmeantime follows in its old channels to England and to the Atlantic\r\nports of the United States. Nevertheless, whoever desires to form an\r\nopinion upon the future history of the Philippines, must not consider\r\nsimply their relations to Spain, but must have regard to the prodigious\r\nchanges which a few decades produce on either side of our planet.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the history of the world the mighty powers\r\non both sides of the ocean have commenced to enter upon a direct\r\nintercourse with one another--Russia, which alone is larger than\r\nany two other parts of the earth; China, which contains within its\r\nown boundaries a third of the population of the world; and America,\r\nwith ground under cultivation nearly sufficient to feed treble the\r\ntotal population of the earth. Russia's further role in the Pacific\r\nOcean is not to be estimated at present.\r\n\r\nThe trade between the two other great powers will therefore be\r\npresumably all the heavier, as the rectification of the pressing need\r\nof human labour on the one side, and of the corresponding overplus\r\non the other, will fall to them.\r\n\r\n\"The world of the ancients was confined to the shores of the\r\nMediterranean; and the Atlantic and Indian Oceans sufficed at one\r\ntime for our traffic. When first the shores of the Pacific re-echoed\r\nwith the sounds of active commerce, the trade of the world and\r\nthe history of the world may be really said to have begun. A start\r\nin that direction has been made; whereas not so very long ago the\r\nimmense ocean was one wide waste of waters, traversed from both points\r\nonly once a year. From 1603 to 1769 scarcely a ship had ever visited\r\nCalifornia, that wonderful country which, twenty-five years ago, with\r\nthe exception of a few places on the coast, was an unknown wilderness,\r\nbut which is now covered with flourishing and prosperous towns and\r\ncities, divided from sea to sea by a railway, and its capital already\r\nranking the third of the seaports of the Union; even at this early\r\nstage of its existence a central point of the world's commerce, and\r\napparently destined, by the proposed junction of the great oceans,\r\nto play a most important part in the future.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the navigation of the west coast of America\r\nextends the influence of the American element over the South Sea,\r\nthe captivating, magic power which the great republic exercises over\r\nthe Spanish colonies[1] will not fail to make itself felt also in the\r\nPhilippines. The Americans are evidently destined to bring to a full\r\ndevelopment the germs originated by the Spaniards. As conquerors of\r\nmodern times, they pursue their road to victory with the assistance\r\nof the pioneer's axe and plough, representing an age of peace and\r\ncommercial prosperity in contrast to that bygone and chivalrous age\r\nwhose champions were upheld by the cross and protected by the sword.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of Spanish America already belongs to the\r\nUnited States, and has since attained an importance which could not\r\npossibly have been anticipated either under the Spanish Government\r\nor during the anarchy which followed. With regard to permanence,\r\nthe Spanish system cannot for a moment be compared with that of\r\nAmerica. While each of the colonies, in order to favour a privileged\r\nclass by immediate gains, exhausted still more the already enfeebled\r\npopulation of the metropolis by the withdrawal of the best of its\r\nability, America, on the contrary, has attracted to itself from all\r\ncountries the most energetic element, which, once on its soil and,\r\nfreed from all fetters, restlessly progressing, has extended its power\r\nand influence still further and further. The Philippines will escape\r\nthe action of the two great neighbouring powers all the less for the\r\nfact that neither they nor their metropolis find their condition of\r\na stable and well-balanced nature.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be desirable for the natives that the above-mentioned\r\nviews should not speedily become accomplished facts, because their\r\neducation and training hitherto have not been of a nature to prepare\r\nthem successfully to compete with either of the other two energetic,\r\ncreative, and progressive nations. They have, in truth, dreamed away\r\ntheir best days.\"\r\n\r\nThis prophecy of Jagor's made a deep impression upon Rizal and\r\nseems to furnish the explanation of his life work. Henceforth it was\r\nhis ambition to arouse his countrymen to prepare themselves for a\r\nfreer state. He dedicated himself to the work which Doctor Jagor had\r\nindicated as necessary. It seems beyond question that Doctor Rizal,\r\nas early as 1876, believed that America would sometime come to the\r\nPhilippines, and wished to prepare his countrymen for the changed\r\nconditions that would then have to be met. Many little incidents\r\nin his later life confirm this view: his eagerness to buy expensive\r\nbooks on the United States, such as his early purchase in Barcelona\r\nof two different \"Lives of the Presidents of the United States\"; his\r\nstudy of the country in his travel across it from San Francisco to\r\nNew York; the reference in \"The Philippines in a Hundred Years\"; and\r\nthe studies of the English Revolution and other Anglo-Saxon influences\r\nwhich culminated in the foundation of the United States of America.\r\n\r\nBesides the interest he took in clay modeling, to which reference\r\nhas already been made, Rizal was expert in carving. When first\r\nin the Ateneo he had carved an image of the Virgin of such grace\r\nand beauty that one of the Fathers asked him to try an image of the\r\nSacred Heart. Rizal complied, and produced the carving that played so\r\nimportant a part in his future life. The Jesuit Father had intended to\r\ntake the image with him to Spain, but in some way it was left behind\r\nand the schoolboys put it up on the door of their dormitory. There it\r\nremained for nearly twenty years, constantly reminding the many lads\r\nwho passed in and out of the one who teachers and pupils alike agreed\r\nwas the greatest of all their number, for Rizal during these years was\r\nthe schoolboy hero of the Ateneo, and from the Ateneo came the men who\r\nwere most largely concerned in making the New Philippines. The image\r\nitself is of batikulin, an easily carved wood, and shows considerable\r\nskill when one remembers that an ordinary pocketknife was the simple\r\ninstrument used in its manufacture. It was recalled to Rizal's memory\r\nwhen he visited the Ateneo upon his first return from Spain and was\r\nforbidden the house by the Jesuits because of his alleged apostasy,\r\nand again in the chapel of Fort Santiago, where it played an important\r\npart in what was called his conversion.\r\n\r\nThe proficiency he attained in the art of clay modeling is evidenced by\r\nmany of the examples illustrated in this volume. They not only indicate\r\nan astonishing versatility, but they reveal his very characteristic\r\nmethod of working--a characteristic based on his constant desire\r\nto adapt the best things he found abroad to the conditions of his\r\nown country. The same characteristic appears also in most of his\r\nliterary work, and in it there is no servile imitation; it is careful\r\nand studied selection, adaptation and combination. For example, the\r\ncomposition of a steel engraving in a French art journal suggested\r\nhis model in clay of a Philippine wild boar; the head of the subject\r\nin a painting in the Luxembourg Gallery and the rest of a figure in\r\nan engraving in a newspaper are combined in a statuette he modeled\r\nin Brussels and sent, in May, 1890, to Valentina Ventura in place\r\nof a letter; a clipping from a newspaper cut is also adapted for\r\nhis model of \"The Vengeance of the Harem\"; and as evidence of his\r\nfacility of expressing himself in this medium, his clay modeling of\r\na Dapitan woman may be cited. One day while in exile he saw a native\r\nwoman clearing up the street in front of her home preparatory to\r\na festival; the movements and the attitudes of the figure were so\r\nthoroughly typical and so impressed themselves on his mind that he\r\nworked out this statuette from memory.\r\n\r\nIn a literary way Rizal's first pretentious effort was a melodrama in\r\none act and in verse, entitled \"Junta al Pasig\" (Beside the Pasig),\r\na play in honor of the Virgin, which was given in the Ateneo to the\r\ngreat edification of a considerable audience, who were enthusiastic\r\nin their praise and hearty in their applause, but the young author\r\nneither saw the play nor paid any attention to the manner of its\r\nreception, for he was downstairs, intent on his own diversions and\r\nheedless of what was going on above.\r\n\r\nThursday was the school holiday in those days, and Rizal usually spent\r\nthe time at the Convent of La Concordia, where his youngest sister,\r\nSoledad, was a boarder. He was a great friend of the little one\r\nand a welcome visitor in the Convent; he used to draw pictures for\r\nher edification, sometimes teasing her by making her own portrait,\r\nto which he gave exaggerated ears to indicate her curiosity. Then he\r\nwrote short satirical skits, such as the following, which in English\r\ndoggerel quite matches its Spanish original:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The girls of Concordia College\r\n  Go dressed in the latest of styles--\r\n  Bangs high on their foreheads for knowledge--\r\n  But hungry their grins and their smiles!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of these girls made an impression upon Jose, and one of his diary\r\nentries of this time tells of his rude awakening when a girl, some\r\nyears his elder, who had laughingly accepted his boyish adoration,\r\ninformed him that she was to marry a relative of his, and he speaks\r\nof the heart-pang with which he watched the carromata that carried\r\nher from his sight to her wedding.\r\n\r\nJose was a great reader, and the newspapers were giving much attention\r\nto the World's Fair in Philadelphia which commemorated the first\r\ncentennial of American independence, and published numerous cuts\r\nillustrating various interesting phases of American life. Possibly\r\nas a reaction from the former disparagement of things American, the\r\nsentiment in the Philippines was then very friendly. There was one\r\nlong account of the presentation of a Spanish banner to a Spanish\r\ncommission in Philadelphia, and the newspapers, in speaking of the\r\nwonderful progress which the United States had made, recalled the\r\nearly Spanish alliance and referred to the fact that, had it not been\r\nfor the discoveries of the Spaniards, their new land would not have\r\nbeen known to Europe.\r\n\r\nRizal during his last two years in the Ateneo was a boarder. Throughout\r\nhis entire course he had been the winner of most of the prizes. Upon\r\nreceiving his Bachelor of Arts diploma he entered the University of\r\nSanto Tomas; in the first year he studied the course in philosophy\r\nand in the second year began to specialize in medicine.\r\n\r\nThe Ateneo course of study was a good deal like that of our present\r\nhigh school, though not so thorough nor so advanced. Still, the method\r\nof instruction which has made Jesuit education notable in all parts\r\nof the world carried on the good work which the mother's training\r\nhad begun. The system required the explanation of the morrow's\r\nlesson, questioning on the lesson of the day and a review of the\r\nprevious day's work. This, with the attention given to the classics,\r\ndeveloped and quickened faculties which gave Rizal a remarkable power\r\nof assimilating knowledge of all kinds for future use.\r\n\r\nThe story is told that Rizal was undecided as to his career, and wrote\r\nto the rector of the Ateneo for advice; but the Jesuit was then in\r\nthe interior of Mindanao, and by the time the answer, suggesting that\r\nhe should devote himself to agriculture, was received, he had already\r\nmade his choice. However, Rizal did continue the study of agriculture,\r\nbesides specializing in medicine, carrying on double work as he took\r\nthe course in the Ateneo which led to the degree of land surveyor and\r\nagricultural expert. This work was completed before he had reached\r\nthe age fixed by law, so that he could not then receive his diploma,\r\nwhich was not delivered to him until he had attained the age of\r\ntwenty-one years.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Life\" of Rizal published in Barcelona after his death a\r\nbrilliant picture is painted of how Rizal might have followed the\r\nadvice of the rector of the Ateneo, and have lived a long, useful\r\nand honorable life as a farmer and gobernadorcillo of his home town,\r\nrespected by the Spaniards, looked up to by his countrymen and filling\r\nan humble but safe lot in life. Today one can hardly feel that such\r\na career would have been suited to the man or regret that events took\r\nthe course they did.\r\n\r\nPoetry was highly esteemed in the Ateneo, and Rizal frequently made\r\nessays in verse, often carrying his compositions to Kalamba for his\r\nmother's criticisms and suggestions. The writings of the Spanish poet\r\nZorilla were making a deep impression upon him at this time, and while\r\nhis schoolmates seemed to have been more interested in their warlike\r\nfeatures, Jose appears to have gained from them an understanding of how\r\nZorilla sought to restore the Spanish people to their former dignity,\r\nrousing their pride through recalling the heroic events in their past\r\nhistory. Some of the passages in the melodrama, \"Junta al Pasig,\"\r\nalready described, were evidently influenced by his study of Zorilla;\r\nthe fierce denunciation of Spain which is there put in the mouth of\r\nSatan expresses, no doubt, the real sentiments of Rizal.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 a society known as the Liceo Literario-Artistica (Lyceum of\r\nArt and Literature) offered a prize for the best poem by a native. The\r\nwinner was Rizal with the following verses, \"Al Juventud Filipino\"\r\n(To the Philippine Youth). The prize was a silver pen, feather-shaped\r\nand with a gold ribbon running through it.\r\n\r\n\r\n To the Philippine Youth\r\n\r\n Theme: \"Growth\"\r\n\r\n (Translation by Charles Derbyshire)\r\n\r\n Hold high the brow serene,\r\n O youth, where now you stand;\r\n Let the bright sheen\r\n Of your grace be seen,\r\n Fair hope of my fatherland!\r\n\r\n Come now, thou genius grand,\r\n And bring down inspiration;\r\n With thy mighty hand,\r\n Swifter than the wind's volation,\r\n Raise the eager mind to higher station.\r\n\r\n Come down with pleasing light\r\n Of art and science to the fight,\r\n O youth, and there untie\r\n The chains that heavy lie,\r\n Your spirit free to blight.\r\n\r\n See how in flaming zone\r\n Amid the shadows thrown,\r\n The Spaniard's holy hand\r\n A crown's resplendent band\r\n Proffers to this Indian land.\r\n\r\n Thou, who now wouldst rise\r\n On wings of rich emprise,\r\n Seeking from Olympian skies\r\n Songs of sweetest strain,\r\n Softer than ambrosial rain;\r\n\r\n Thou, whose voice divine\r\n Rivals Philomel's refrain,\r\n And with varied line\r\n Through the night benign\r\n Frees mortality from pain;\r\n\r\n Thou, who by sharp strife\r\n Wakest thy mind to life;\r\n And the memory bright\r\n Of thy genius' light\r\n Makest immortal in its strength;\r\n\r\n And thou, in accents clear\r\n of Phoebus, to Apells dear;\r\n Or by the brush's magic art\r\n Takest from nature's store a part,\r\n To fix it on the simple canvas' length;\r\n\r\n Go forth, and then the sacred fire\r\n Of thy genius to the laurel may aspire;\r\n To spread around the fame,\r\n And in victory acclaim,\r\n Through wider spheres the human name.\r\n\r\n Day, O happy day,\r\n Fair Filipinas, for thy land!\r\n So bless the Power today\r\n That places in thy way\r\n This favor and this fortune grand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next competition at the Liceo was in honor of the fourth centennial\r\nof the death of Cervantes; it was open to both Filipinos and Spaniards,\r\nand there was a dispute as to the winner of the prize. It is hard\r\nto figure out just what really happened; the newspapers speak of\r\nRizal as winning the first prize, but his certificate says second,\r\nand there seems to have been some sort of compromise by which a\r\nSpaniard who was second was put at the head. Newspapers, of course,\r\nwere then closely censored, but the liberal La Oceania contains a\r\nnumber of veiled allusions to medical poets, suggesting that for the\r\ngood of humanity they should not be permitted to waste their time in\r\nverse-making. One reference quotes the title of Rizal's first poem in\r\nsaying that it was giving a word of advice \"To the Philippine Youth,\"\r\nand there are other indications that for some considerable time the\r\noutcome of this contest was a very live topic in the city of Manila.\r\n\r\nRizal's poem was an allegory, \"The Council of the Gods\"--\"El consejo de\r\nlos Dioses.\" It was an exceedingly artistic appreciation of the chief\r\nfigure in Spanish literature. The rector of the Ateneo had assisted\r\nhis former student by securing for him needed books, and though\r\nRizal was at that time a student in Santo Tomas, the rivalries were\r\nsuch that he was still ranked with the pupils of the Jesuits and his\r\nsuccess was a corresponding source of elation to the Ateneo pupils and\r\nalumni. Some people have stated that Father Evaristo Arias, a notably\r\nbrilliant writer of the Dominicans, was a competitor, a version I once\r\npublished, but investigation shows that this was a mistake. However,\r\nsentiment in the University against Rizal grew, until matters became\r\nso unpleasant that he felt it time to follow the advice of Father\r\nBurgos and continue his education outside of the Islands.\r\n\r\nJust before this incident Rizal had been the victim of a brutal assault\r\nin Kalamba; one night when he was passing the barracks of the Civil\r\nGuard he noted in the darkness a large body, but did not recognize\r\nwho it was, and passed without any attention to it. It turned out\r\nthat the large body was a lieutenant of the Civil Guard, and, without\r\nwarning or word of any kind, he drew his sword and wounded Rizal in the\r\nback. Rizal complained of this outrage to the authorities and tried\r\nseveral times, without success, to see the Governor-General. Finally\r\nhe had to recognize that there was no redress for him. By May of 1882\r\nRizal had made up his mind to set sail for Europe, and his brother,\r\nPaciano, equipped him with seven hundred pesos for the journey, while\r\nhis sister, Saturnina, intrusted to him a valuable diamond ring which\r\nmight prove a resource in time of emergency.\r\n\r\nJose had gone to Kalamba to attend a festival there, when Mr. Hidalgo,\r\nfrom Manila, notified him that his boat was ready to sail. The\r\ntelegram, asking his immediate return to the city, was couched in\r\nthe form of advice of the condition of a patient, and the name of\r\nthe steamer, Salvadora, by a play on words, was used in the sense of\r\n\"May save her life.\" Rizal had previously requested of Mr. Ramirez,\r\nof the Puerta del Sol store, letters of introduction to an Englishman,\r\nformerly in the Philippines, who was then living in Paris. He said\r\nnothing more of his intentions, but on his last night in the city,\r\nwith his younger sister as companion, he drove all through the walled\r\ncity and its suburbs, changing horses twice in the five hours of\r\nhis farewell. The next morning he embarked on the steamer, and there\r\nyet remains the sketch which he made of his last view of the city,\r\nshowing its waterfront as it appeared from the departing steamer. To\r\nleave town it was necessary to have a passport; his was in the name\r\nof Jose Mercado, and had been secured by a distant relative of his\r\nwho lived in the Santa Cruz district.\r\n\r\nAfter five days' journey the little steamer reached the English colony\r\nof Singapore. There Rizal saw a modern city for the first time. He was\r\nintensely interested in the improvements. Especially did the assured\r\nposition of the natives, confident in their rights and not fearful of\r\nthe authorities, arouse his admiration. Great was the contrast between\r\nthe fear of their rulers shown by the Filipinos and the confidence\r\nwhich the natives of Singapore seemed to have in their government.\r\n\r\nAt Singapore, Rizal transferred to a French mail Steamer and seems to\r\nhave had an interesting time making himself understood on board. He\r\nhad studied some French in his Ateneo course, writing an ode which\r\ngained honors, but when he attempted to speak the language he was\r\nnot successful in making Frenchmen understand him. So he resorted to\r\na mixed system of his own, sometimes using Latin words and making\r\nthe changes which regularly would have occurred, and when words\r\nfailed, making signs, and in extreme cases drawing pictures of what\r\nhe wanted. This versatility with the pencil, for many of his offhand\r\nsketches had humorous touches that almost carried them into the cartoon\r\nclass, interested officers and passengers, so that the young student\r\nhad the freedom of the ship and a voyage far from tedious.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Suez Canal, a glimpse of Egypt, Aden, where East and\r\nWest meet, and the Italian city of Naples, with its historic castle,\r\nwere the features of the trip which most impressed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nThe Period of Preparation\r\n\r\nRizal disembarked at Marseilles, saw a little of that famous port, and\r\nthen went by rail to Barcelona, crossing the Pyrenees, the desolate\r\nruggedness of which contrasted with the picturesque luxuriance\r\nof his tropical home, and remained a day at the frontier town of\r\nPort-Bou. The customary Spanish disregard of tourists compared very\r\nunfavorably with the courteous attention which he had remarked on his\r\narrival at Marseilles, for the custom house officers on the Spanish\r\nfrontier rather reminded him of the class of employes found in Manila.\r\n\r\nAt Barcelona he met many who had been his schoolmates in the Ateneo\r\nand others to whom he was known by name. It was the custom of the\r\nFilipino students there to hold reunions every other Sunday at the\r\ncafe, for their limited resources did not permit the daily visits\r\nwhich were the Spanish custom. In honor of the new arrival a special\r\ngathering occurred in a favorite cafe in Plaza de Catalonia. The\r\ncharacteristics of the Spaniards and the features of Barcelona were\r\nall described for Rizal's benefit, and he had to answer a host of\r\nquestions about the changes which had occurred in Manila. Most of his\r\nanswers were to the effect that old defects had not yet been remedied\r\nnor incompetent officials supplanted, and he gave a rather hopeless\r\nview of the future of their country. Somewhat in this gloomy mood,\r\nhe wrote home for a newly established Tagalog newspaper of Manila,\r\nhis views of \"Love of country,\" an article not so optimistic as most\r\nof his later writings.\r\n\r\nIn Barcelona he remained but a short time, long enough, however, to\r\nsee the historic sights around that city, which was established by\r\nHannibal, had numbered many noted Romans among its residents, and in\r\nlater days was the scene of the return of Columbus from his voyages in\r\nthe New World, bringing with him samples of Redskins, birds and other\r\nnovel products of the unknown country. Then there were the magnificent\r\nboulevards, the handsome dwellings, the interest which the citizens\r\ntook in adorning their city and the pride in the results, and above\r\nall, the disgust at all things Spanish and the loyalty to Catalonia,\r\nrather than to the \"mother-fatherland.\"\r\n\r\nThe Catalan was the most progressive type in Spain, but he had no\r\nlove for his compatriots, was ever complaining of their \"manana\"\r\nhabits and of the evils that were bound to exist in a country where\r\nChurch and State were so inextricably intermingled. Many Catalans were\r\navowedly republicans. Signs might be seen on the outside of buildings\r\ntelling of the location of republican clubs, unpopular officials\r\nwere hooted in the streets, the newspapers were intemperate in their\r\ncriticism of the government, and a campaign was carried on openly\r\nwhich aimed at changing from a monarchy to a democracy, without any\r\napparent molestation from the authorities. All these things impressed\r\nthe lad who had seen in his own country the most respectfully worded\r\ncomplaints of unquestionable abuses treated as treason, bringing not\r\nmerely punishment, but opprobrium as well.\r\n\r\nHe, himself, in order to obtain a better education, had had to leave\r\nhis country stealthily like a fugitive from justice, and his family, to\r\nsave themselves from persecution, were compelled to profess ignorance\r\nof his plans and movements. His name was entered in Santo Tomas at the\r\nopening of the new term, with the fees paid, and Paciano had gone to\r\nManila pretending to be looking for this brother whom he had assisted\r\nout of the country.\r\n\r\nEarly in the fall Rizal removed to Madrid and entered the Central\r\nUniversity there. His short residence in Barcelona was possibly for\r\nthe purpose of correcting the irregularity in his passport, for in\r\nthat town it would be easier to obtain a cedula, and with this his\r\nway in the national University would be made smoother. He enrolled in\r\ntwo courses, medicine, and literature and philosophy; besides these\r\nhe studied sculpture, drawing and art in San Carlos, and took private\r\nlessons in languages from Mr. Hughes, a well-known instructor of the\r\ncity. With all these labors it is not strange that he did not mingle\r\nlargely in social life, and lack of funds and want of clothes, which\r\nhave been suggested as reasons for this, seem hardly adequate. Jose had\r\nleft Manila with some seven hundred pesos and a diamond ring. Besides,\r\nhe received funds from his father monthly, which were sent through\r\nhis cousin, Antonio Rivera, of Manila, for fear that the landlords\r\nmight revenge themselves upon their tenant for the slight which his\r\nson had cast upon their university in deserting it for a Peninsular\r\ninstitution. It was no easy task in those days for a lad from the\r\nprovinces to get out of the Islands for study abroad.\r\n\r\nRizal frequently attended the theater, choosing especially the higher\r\nclass dramas, occasionally went to a masked ball, played the lotteries\r\nin small amounts but regularly, and for the rest devoted most of\r\nhis money to the purchase of books. The greater part of these were\r\nsecond-hand, but he bought several standard works in good editions,\r\nmany with bindings de luxe. Among the books first purchased figure\r\na Spanish translation of the \"Lives of the Presidents of the United\r\nStates,\" from Washington to Johnson, morocco bound, gilt-edged,\r\nand illustrated with steel engravings--certainly an expensive book;\r\na \"History of the English Revolution;\" a comparison of the Romans\r\nand the Teutons, and several other books which indicated interest in\r\nthe freer system of the Anglo-Saxons. Later, another \"History of the\r\nPresidents,\" to Cleveland, was added to his library.\r\n\r\nThe following lines, said to be addressed to his mother, were written\r\nabout this time, evidently during an attack of homesickness:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"You Ask Me for Verses\"\r\n\r\n  (Translated by Charles Derbyshire)\r\n\r\n  You bid me now to strike the lyre,\r\n  That mute and torn so long has lain;\r\n  And yet I cannot wake the strain,\r\n  Nor will the Muse one note inspire!\r\n  Coldly it shakes in accents dire,\r\n  As if my soul itself to wring,\r\n  And when its sound seems but to fling\r\n  A jest at its own low lament;\r\n  So in sad isolation pent,\r\n  My soul can neither feel nor sing.\r\n\r\n  There was a time--ah, 'tis too true--\r\n  But that time long ago has past--\r\n  When upon me the Muse had cast\r\n  Indulgent smile and friendship's due;\r\n  But of that age now all too few\r\n  The thoughts that with me yet will stay;\r\n  As from the hours of festive play\r\n  There linger on mysterious notes,\r\n  And in our minds the memory floats\r\n  Of minstrelsy and music gay.\r\n\r\n  A plant I am, that scarcely grown,\r\n  Was torn from out its Eastern bed,\r\n  Where all around perfume is shed,\r\n  And life but as a dream is known;\r\n  The land that I can call my own,\r\n\r\n  By me forgotten ne'er to be,\r\n  Where trilling birds their song taught me,\r\n  And cascades with their ceaseless roar,\r\n  And all along the spreading shore\r\n  The murmurs of the sounding sea.\r\n\r\n  While yet in childhood's happy day,\r\n  I learned upon its sun to smile,\r\n  And in my breast there seemed the while\r\n  Seething volcanic fires to play.\r\n  A bard I was, and my wish alway\r\n  To call upon the fleeting wind,\r\n  With all the force of verse and mind:\r\n  \"Go forth, and spread around its fame,\r\n  From zone to zone with glad acclaim,\r\n  And earth to heaven together bind!\"\r\n\r\n  But it I left, and now no more--\r\n  Like a tree that is broken and sere--\r\n  My natal gods bring the echo clear\r\n  Of songs that in past times they bore;\r\n  Wide seas I cross'd to foreign shore,\r\n  With hope of change and other fate;\r\n  My folly was made clear too late,\r\n  For in the place of good I sought\r\n  The seas reveal'd unto me naught,\r\n  But made death's specter on me wait.\r\n\r\n  All these fond fancies that were mine,\r\n  All love, all feeling, all emprise,\r\n  Were left beneath the sunny skies,\r\n  Which o'er that flowery region shine;\r\n  So press no more that plea of thine,\r\n\r\n  For songs of love from out a heart\r\n  That coldly lies a thing apart;\r\n  Since now with tortur'd soul I haste\r\n  Unresting o'er the desert waste,\r\n  And lifeless gone is all my art.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Madrid a number of young Filipinos were intense enthusiasts over\r\npolitical agitation, and with the recklessness of youth, were careless\r\nof what they said or how they said it, so long as it brought no danger\r\nto them. A sort of Philippine social club had been organized by older\r\nFilipinos and Spaniards interested in the Philippines, with the idea\r\nof quietly assisting toward improved insular conditions, but it became\r\nso radical under the influence of this younger majority, that its\r\nconservative members were compelled to drop out and the club broke\r\nup. The young men were constantly holding meetings to revive it, but\r\nnever arrived at any effective conclusions. Rizal was present at some\r\nof these meetings and suggested that a good means of propaganda would\r\nbe a book telling the truth about Philippine conditions and illustrated\r\nby Filipino artists. At first the project was severely criticised;\r\nlater a few conformed to the plan, and Rizal believed that his scheme\r\nwas in a fair way of accomplishment. At the meeting to discuss the\r\ndetails, however, each member of the company wanted to write upon the\r\nFilipino woman, and therest of the subjects scarcely interested any of\r\nthem. Rizal was disgusted with this trifling and dropped the affair,\r\nnor did he ever again seem to take any very enthusiastic interest in\r\nsuch popular movements. His more mature mind put him out of sympathy\r\nwith the younger men. Their admiration gave him great prestige, but\r\nhis popularity did not arise from comradeship, as he had but very\r\nfew intimates.\r\n\r\nEarly in his stay in Madrid, Rizal had come across a second-hand\r\ncopy, in two volumes, of a French novel, which he bought to improve\r\nhis knowledge of that language. It was Eugene Sue's \"The Wandering\r\nJew,\" that work which transformed the France of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. However one may agree or disagree with its teachings and\r\nconcede or dispute its literary merits, it cannot be denied that it\r\nwas the most powerful book in its effects on the century, surpassing\r\neven Mrs. Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" which is usually credited\r\nwith having hurried on the American Civil War and brought about\r\nthe termination of African slavery in the United States. The book,\r\nhe writes in his diary, affected him powerfully, not to tears, but\r\nwith a tremendous sympathy for the unfortunates that made him willing\r\nto risk everything in their behalf. It seemed to him that such a\r\npresentation of Philippine conditions would certainly arouse Spain,\r\nbut his modesty forbade his saying that he was going to write a book\r\nlike the French masterpiece. Still, from this time his recollections\r\nof his youth and the stories which he could get from his companions\r\nwere written down and revised, till finally the half had been prepared\r\nof what was finally the novel \"Noli Me Tangere.\"\r\n\r\nThrough Spaniards who still remembered Jose's uncle, he joined a\r\nlodge of Masons called the \"Acacia.\" At this time few Filipinos in\r\nSpain had joined the institution, and those were mostly men much more\r\nmature than himself. Thus he met leaders of Spanish national life who\r\nwere men of state affairs and much more sedate, men with broader views\r\nand more settled opinions than the irresponsible class with whom his\r\nschool companions were accustomed to associate. A distinction must\r\nbe made between the Masonry of this time and the much more popular\r\ninstitution in which Filipinos later figured so largely when Professor\r\nMiguel Morayta became head of the Grand Lodge which for a time was\r\na rival of that to which the \"Acacia\" owed allegiance, and finally\r\ntriumphed over it.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 Rizal had begun his studies in English; he had been studying\r\nFrench during and since his voyage to Spain; Italian was acquired\r\napparently at a time when the exposition of Genoa had attracted Spanish\r\ninterest toward Italy, and largely through the reading of Italian\r\ntranslations of works which he knew in other languages. German, too,\r\nhe had started to study, but had not advanced far with it. Thus Rizal\r\nwas preparing himself for the travels through Europe which he had\r\nintended to make from the time when he first left his home, for he\r\nwell knew that it was only by knowing the language of a country that\r\nit would be possible for him to study the people, see in what way\r\nthey differed from his own, and find out which of their customs and\r\nwhat lessons from their history might be of advantage to the Filipinos.\r\n\r\nA feature in Rizal's social life was a weekly visit to the home of\r\nDon Pablo Ortigas y Reyes, a liberal Spaniard who had been Civil\r\nGovernor of Manila in General de La Torre's time. Here Filipino\r\nstudents gathered, and were entertained by the charming daughter of\r\nthe home, Consuelo, who was the person to whom were dedicated the\r\nverses of Rizal usually entitled \"a la Senorita C. O. y R.\"\r\n\r\nIn Rizal's later days he found a regular relaxation in playing chess,\r\nin which he was skilled, with the venerable ex-president of the\r\nshort-lived Spanish republic, Pi y Margal. This statesman was accused\r\nof German tendencies because of his inclination toward Anglo-Saxon\r\nsafeguards for liberty, and was a champion of general education as\r\na preparation for a freer Spain.\r\n\r\nRizal usually was present on public occasions in Filipino circles\r\nand took a leading part in them, as, for example, when he delivered\r\nthe principal address at the banquet given by the Madrid Filipino\r\ncolony in honor of their artist countrymen, after Luna and Hidalgo\r\nhad won prizes in the Madrid National exposition. He was also at the\r\nNew Year's banquet when the students gathered in the restaurant to\r\nbid farewell to the old and usher in the new year, and his was the\r\nchief speech, summarizing the remarks of the others.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, having completed the second of his two courses, with his\r\ncredentials of licentiate in medicine and also in philosophy and\r\nliterature, Rizal made a trip through the country provinces to\r\nstudy the Spanish peasant, for the rural people, he thought, being\r\nagriculturists, would be most like the farmer folk of his native\r\nland. Surely the Filipinos did not suffer in the comparison, for the\r\nSpanish peasants had not greatly changed from the day when they were\r\nso masterfully described by Cervantes. It seemed to Rizal almost like\r\nbeing in Don Quixote's land, so many were the figures who might have\r\nbeen the characters in the book.\r\n\r\nThe fall of '85 found Rizal in Paris, studying art, visiting the\r\nvarious museums and associating with the Lunas, the Taveras and\r\nother Filipino residents of the French capital, for there had been\r\na considerable colony in that city ever since the troubles of 1872\r\nhad driven the Tavera family into exile and they had made their home\r\nin that city. In Paris a fourth of \"Noli Me Tangere\" was written,\r\nand Rizal specialized in ophthalmology, devoting his attention to\r\nthose eye troubles that were most prevalent in the Philippines and\r\nleast understood. His mother's growing blindness made him covet the\r\nskill which might enable him to restore her sight. So successfully\r\ndid he study that he became the favorite pupil of Doctor L. de\r\nWeckert, the leading authority among the oculists of France, and\r\nauthor of a three-volume standard work. Rizal next went to Germany,\r\nhaving continued his studies in its language in the French capital,\r\nand was present at Heidelberg on the five hundredth anniversary of\r\nthe foundation of the University.\r\n\r\nBecause he had no passport he could only attend lectures, but could\r\nnot regularly matriculate. He lived in one of the student boarding\r\nhouses, with a number of law students, and when he was proposed for\r\nmembership in the Chess Club he was registered in the Club books as\r\nbeing a student of law like the men who proposed him. These Chess\r\nClub gatherings were quite a feature of the town, being held in the\r\nlarge saloons with several hundred people present, and the contests\r\nof skill were eagerly watched by shrewd and competent judges. Rizal\r\nwas a clever player, and left something of a record among the experts.\r\n\r\nThe following lines were written by Rizal in a letter home while he\r\nwas a student in Germany:\r\n\r\n\r\n  To the Flowers of Heidelberg\r\n\r\n  (translation by Charles Derbyshire)\r\n\r\n  Go to my native land, go, foreign flowers,\r\n  Sown by the traveler on his way;\r\n  And there beneath its azure sky,\r\n  Where all of my affections lie;\r\n  There from the weary pilgrim say,\r\n  What faith is his in that land of ours!\r\n\r\n  Go there and tell how when the dawn,\r\n  Her early light diffusing,\r\n  Your petals first flung open wide;\r\n  His steps beside chill Neckar drawn,\r\n  You see him silent by your side,\r\n  Upon its Spring perennial musing.\r\n\r\n  Saw how when morning's light,\r\n  All your fragrance stealing,\r\n  Whispers to you as in mirth\r\n  Playful songs of love's delight,\r\n  He, too, murmurs his love's feeling\r\n  In the tongue he learned at birth.\r\n\r\n  That when the sun on Koenigstuhl's height\r\n  Pours out its golden flood,\r\n  And with its slowly warming light\r\n  Gives life vale and grove and wood,\r\n  He greets that sun, here only upraising,\r\n  Which in his native land is at its zenith blazing.\r\n\r\n  And tell there of that day he stood,\r\n  Near to a ruin'd castle gray,\r\n  By Neckar's banks, or shady wood,\r\n  And pluck'd you from beside the way;\r\n  Tell, too, the tale to you addressed,\r\n  And how with tender care,\r\n  Your bending leaves he press'd\r\n  'Twixt pages of some volume rare.\r\n\r\n  Bear then, O flowers, love's message bear;\r\n  My love to all the lov'd ones there,\r\n  Peace to my country--fruitful land--\r\n  Faith whereon its sons may stand,\r\n  And virtue for its daughters' care;\r\n  All those beloved creatures greet,\r\n  That still around home's altar meet.\r\n\r\n  And when you come unto its shore,\r\n  This kiss I now on you bestow,\r\n  Fling where the winged breezes blow;\r\n  That borne on them it may hover o'er\r\n  All that I love, esteem, and adore.\r\n\r\n  But though, O flowers, you come unto that land,\r\n  And still perchance your colors hold;\r\n  So far from this heroic strand,\r\n  Whose soil first bade your life unfold,\r\n  Still here your fragrance will expand;\r\n  Your soul that never quits the earth\r\n  Whose light smiled on you at your birth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Heidelberg he went to Leipzig, then famous for the new studies\r\nin psychology which were making the science of the mind almost as\r\nexact as that of the body, and became interested in the comparison\r\nof race characteristics as influenced by environment, history and\r\nlanguage. This probably accounts for the advanced views held by Rizal,\r\nwho was thoroughly abreast of the new psychology. These ideas were\r\nsince popularized in America largely through Professor Hugo Munsterberg\r\nof Harvard University, who was a fellow-student of Rizal at Heidelberg\r\nand also had been at Leipzig.\r\n\r\nA little later Rizal went to Berlin and there became acquainted with\r\na number of men who had studied the Philippines and knew it as none\r\nwhom he had ever met previously. Chief among these was Doctor Jagor,\r\nthe author of the book which ten years before had inspired in him his\r\nlife purpose of preparing his people for the time when America should\r\ncome to the Philippines. Then there was Doctor Rudolf Virchow, head of\r\nthe Anthropological Society and one of the greatest scientists in the\r\nworld. Virchow was of intensely democratic ideals, he was a statesman\r\nas well as a scientist, and the interest of the young student in the\r\nhistory of his country and in everything else which concerned it,\r\nand his sincere earnestness, so intelligently directed toward helping\r\nhis country, made Rizal at once a prime favorite. Under Virchow's\r\nsponsorship he became a member of the Berlin Anthropological Society.\r\n\r\nRizal lived in the third floor of a corner lodging house not very\r\nfar from the University; in this room he spent much of his time,\r\nputting the finishing touches to what he had previously written of\r\nhis novel, and there he wrote the latter half of \"Noli Me Tangere\"\r\nThe German influence, and absence from the Philippines for so long a\r\ntime, had modified his early radical views, and the book had now become\r\nless an effort to arouse the Spanish sense of justice than a means of\r\neducation for Filipinos by pointing out their shortcomings. Perhaps a\r\nSpanish school history which he had read in Madrid deserves a part of\r\nthe credit for this changed point of view, since in that the author,\r\ntreating of Spain's early misfortunes, brings out the fact that\r\nmisgovernment may be due quite as much to the hypocrisy, servility\r\nand undeserving character of the people as it is to the corruption,\r\ntyranny and cruelty of the rulers.\r\n\r\nThe printer of \"Noli Me Tangere\" lived in a neighboring street, and,\r\nlike most printers in Germany, worked for a very moderate compensation,\r\nso that the volume of over four hundred pages cost less than a fourth\r\nof what it would have done in England, or one half of what it would\r\ncost in economical Spain. Yet even at so modest a price, Rizal was\r\ndelayed in the publication until one fortunate morning he received a\r\nvisit from a countryman, Doctor Maximo Viola, who invited him to take a\r\npedestrian trip. Rizal responded that his interests kept him in Berlin\r\nat that time as he was awaiting funds from home with which to publish\r\na book he had just completed, and showed him the manuscript. Doctor\r\nViola was much interested and offered to use the money he had put\r\naside for the trip to help pay the publisher. So the work went ahead,\r\nand when the delayed remittance from his family arrived, Rizal repaid\r\nthe obligation. Then the two sallied forth on their trip.\r\n\r\nAfter a considerable tour of the historic spots and scenic places\r\nin Germany, they arrived at Dresden, where Doctor Rizal was warmly\r\ngreeted by Doctor A. B. Meyer, the Director of the Royal Saxony\r\nEthnographical Institute. He was an authority upon Philippine matters,\r\nfor some years before he had visited the Islands to make a study of\r\nthe people. With a countryman resident in the Philippines, Doctor\r\nMeyer made careful and thorough scientific investigations, and his\r\nconclusions were more favorable to the Filipinos than the published\r\nviews of many of the unscientific Spanish observers.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum of Art at Dresden, Rizal saw a painting of \"Prometheus\r\nBound,\" which recalled to him a representation of the same idea\r\nin a French gallery, and from memory he modeled this figure, which\r\nespecially appealed to him as being typical of his country.\r\n\r\nIn Austrian territory he first visited Doctor Ferdinand Blumentritt,\r\nwhom Rizal had known by reputation for many years and with whom he had\r\nlong corresponded. The two friends stayed at the Hotel Roderkrebs,\r\nbut were guests at the table of the Austrian professor, whose wife\r\ngave them appetizing demonstrations of the characteristic cookery\r\nof Hungary. During Rizal's stay he was very much interested in a\r\ngathering of tourists, arranged to make known the beauties of that\r\npicturesque region, sometimes called the Austrian Switzerland, and\r\nhe delivered an address upon this occasion. It is noteworthy that\r\nthe present interest in attracting tourists to the Philippines, as\r\nan economic benefit to the country, was anticipated by Doctor Rizal\r\nand that he was always looking up methods used in foreign countries\r\nfor building up tourists' travel.\r\n\r\nOne day, while the visitors were discussing Philippine matters with\r\ntheir host, Doctor Rizal made an off hand sketch of Doctor Blumentritt,\r\non a scrap of paper which happened to be at hand, so characteristic\r\nthat it serves as an excellent portrait, and it has been preserved\r\namong the Rizal relics which Doctor Blumentritt had treasured of the\r\nfriend for whom he had so much respect and affection.\r\n\r\nWith a letter of introduction to a friend of Doctor Blumentritt in\r\nVienna, Nordenfels, the greatest of Austrian novelists, Doctor Viola\r\nand Doctor Rizal went on to the capital, where they were entertained\r\nby the Concordia Club. So favorable was the impression that Rizal\r\nmade upon Mr. Nordenfels that an answer was written to the note of\r\nintroduction, thanking the professor for having brought to his notice\r\na person whom he had found so companionable and whose genius he so\r\nmuch admired. Nordenfels had been interested in Spanish subjects,\r\nand was able to discuss intelligently the peculiar development of\r\nCastilian civilization and the politics of the Spanish metropolis as\r\nthey affected the overseas possessions.\r\n\r\nAfter having seen Rome and a little more of Italy, they embarked for\r\nthe Philippines, again on the French mail, from Marseilles, coming\r\nby way of Saigon, where a rice steamer was taken for Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe Period of Propaganda\r\n\r\nThe city had not altered much during Rizal's seven years of\r\nabsence. The condition of the Binondo pavement, with the same holes\r\nin the road which Rizal claimed he remembered as a schoolboy, was\r\nunchanged, and this recalls the experience of Ybarra in \"Noli Me\r\nTangere\" on his homecoming after a like period of absence.\r\n\r\nDoctor Rizal at once went to his home in Kalamba. His first operation\r\nin the Philippines relieved the blindness of his mother, by the removal\r\nof a double cataract, and thus the object of his special study in\r\nParis was accomplished. This and other like successes gave the young\r\noculist a fame which brought patients from all parts of Luzon; and,\r\nthough his charges were moderate, during his seven months' stay\r\nin the Islands Doctor Rizal accumulated over five thousand pesos,\r\nbesides a number of diamonds which he had bought as a secure way of\r\ncarrying funds, mindful of the help that the ring had been with which\r\nhe had first started from the Philippines.\r\n\r\nShortly after his arrival, Governor-General Terrero summoned Rizal by\r\ntelegraph to Malacanan from Kalamba. The interview proved to be due\r\nto the interest in the author of \"Noli Me Tangere\" and a curiosity\r\nto read the novel, arising from the copious extracts with which the\r\nManila censors had submitted an unfavorable opinion when asking for\r\nthe prohibition of the book. The recommendation of the censor was\r\ndisregarded, and General Terrero, fearful that Rizal might be molested\r\nby some of the many persons who would feel themselves aggrieved by his\r\nplain picturing of undesirable classes in the Philippines, gave him for\r\na bodyguard a young Spanish lieutenant, Jose Taviel de Andrade. The\r\nyoung men soon became fast friends, as they had artistic and other\r\ntastes in common. Once they climbed Mr. Makiling, near Kalamba,\r\nand placed there, after the European custom, a flag to show that\r\nthey had reached the summit. This act was at first misrepresented by\r\nthe enemies of Rizal as planting a German banner, for they started\r\na story that he had taken possession of the Islands in the name of\r\nthe country where he was educated, which was just then in unfriendly\r\nrelations with Spain over the question of the ill treatment of the\r\nProtestant missionaries in the Caroline Islands. This same story was\r\nrepeated after the American occupation with the variation that Rizal,\r\nas the supreme chief and originator of the ideas of the Katipunan\r\n(which in fact he was not--he was even opposed to the society as it\r\nexisted in his time), had placed there a Filipino banner, in token\r\nthat the Islands intended to reassume the independent condition of\r\nwhich the Spanish had dispossessed them.\r\n\r\n\"Noli Me Tangere\" circulated first among Doctor Rizal's relatives;\r\non one occasion a cousin made a special trip to Kalamba and took\r\nthe author to task for having caricatured her in the character of\r\nDona Victorina. Rizal made no denial, but merely suggested that the\r\nbook was a mirror of Philippine life, with types that unquestionably\r\nexisted in the country, and that if anybody recognized one of the\r\ncharacters as picturing himself or herself, that person would do well\r\nto correct the faults which therein appeared ridiculous.\r\n\r\nA somewhat liberal administration was now governing the Philippines,\r\nand efforts were being made to correct the more glaring abuses in\r\nthe social conditions. One of these reforms proposed that the larger\r\nestates should bear their share of the taxes, which it was believed\r\nthey were then escaping to a great extent. Requests were made of the\r\nmunicipal government of Kalamba, among other towns, for a statement\r\nof the relation that the big Dominican hacienda bore to the town,\r\nwhat increase or decrease there might have been in the income of the\r\nestate, and what taxes the proprietors were paying compared with the\r\nrevenue their place afforded.\r\n\r\nRizal interested the people of the community to gather reliable\r\nstatistics, to go thoroughly into the actual conditions, and to leave\r\nout the generalities which usually characterized Spanish documents.\r\n\r\nHe asked the people to cooeperate, pointing out that when they\r\ndid not complain it was their own fault more than that of the\r\ngovernment if they suffered injustice. Further, he showed the folly\r\nof exaggerated statements, and insisted upon a definite and moderate\r\nshowing of such abuses as were unquestionably within the power of\r\nthe authorities to relieve. Rizal himself prepared the report, which\r\nis an excellent presentation of the grievances of the people of his\r\ntown. It brings forward as special points in favor of the community\r\ntheir industriousness, their willingness to help themselves, their\r\ninterest in education, and concludes with expressing confidence\r\nin the fairness of the government, pointing out the fact that they\r\nwere risking the displeasure of their landlords by furnishing the\r\ninformation requested. The paper made a big stir, and its essential\r\nstatements, like everything else in Rizal's writings, were never\r\nsuccessfully challenged.\r\n\r\nConditions in Manila were at that time disturbed owing to the\r\nprecedence which had been given in a local festival to the Chinese,\r\nbecause they paid more money. The Filipinos claimed that, being in\r\ntheir home country, they should have had prior consideration and were\r\nentitled to it by law. The matter culminated in a protest, which was\r\ndoubtless submitted to Doctor Rizal on the eve of his departure from\r\nthe Islands; the protest in a general way met with his approval, but\r\nthe theatrical methods adopted in the presentation of it can hardly\r\nhave been according to his advice.\r\n\r\nHe sailed for Hongkong in February of 1888, and made a short stay in\r\nthe British colony, becoming acquainted there with Jose Maria Basa, an\r\nexile of '72, who had constituted himself the especial guardian of the\r\nFilipino students in that city. The visitor was favorably impressed by\r\nthe methods of education in the British colony and with the spirit of\r\npatriotism developed thereby. He also looked into the subject of the\r\nlarge investments in Hongkong property by the corporation landlords\r\nof the Philippines, their preparation for the day of trouble which\r\nthey foresaw.\r\n\r\nRizal was interested in the Chinese theater, comparing the plays with\r\nthe somewhat similar productions which existed in the Philippines;\r\nthere, however, they had been given a religious twist, which at\r\nfirst glance hid their debt to the Chinese drama. The Doctor notes\r\nmeeting, at nearby Macao, an exile of '72, whose condition and patient,\r\nuncomplaining bearing of his many troubles aroused Rizal's sympathies\r\nand commanded his admiration.\r\n\r\nWith little delay, the journey was continued to Japan, where Doctor\r\nRizal was surprised by an invitation to make his home in the Spanish\r\nconsulate. There he was hospitably entertained, and a like courtesy\r\nwas shown him in the Spanish minister's home in Tokio. The latter\r\neven offered him a position, as a sort of interpreter, probably,\r\nshould he care to remain in the country. This offer, however, was\r\ndeclined. Rizal made considerable investigation into the condition\r\nof the various Japanese classes and acquired such facility in the\r\nuse of the language that with it and his appearance, for he was \"very\r\nJapanese,\" the natives found it difficult to believe that he was not\r\none of themselves. The month or more passed here he considered one of\r\nthe happiest in his travels, and it was with regret that he sailed\r\nfrom Yokohama for San Francisco. A Japanese newspaper man, who knew\r\nno other language than his own, was a companion on the entire journey\r\nto London, and Rizal acted as his interpreter.\r\n\r\nNot only did he enter into the spirit of the language but with\r\nremarkable versatility he absorbed the spirit of the Japanese artists\r\nand acquired much dexterity in expressing himself in their style,\r\nas is shown by one of the illustrations in this book. The popular\r\nidea that things occidental are reversed in the Orient was amusingly\r\ncaricatured in a sketch he made of a German face; by reversing its\r\nlines he converted it into an old-time Japanese countenance.\r\n\r\nThe diary of the voyage from Hongkong to Japan records an incident to\r\nwhich he alludes as being similar to that of Aladdin in the Tagalog\r\ntale of Florante. The Filipino wife of an Englishman, Mrs. Jackson,\r\nwho was a passenger on board, told Rizal a great deal about a\r\nFilipino named Rachal, who was educated in Europe and had written a\r\nmuch-talked-of novel, which she described and of which she spoke in\r\nsuch flattering terms that Rizal declared his identity. The confusion\r\nin names is explained by the fact that Rachal is a name well known\r\nin the Philippines as that of a popular make of piano.\r\n\r\nAt San Francisco the boat was held for some time in quarantine because\r\nof sickness aboard, and Rizal was impressed by the fact that the\r\nvaluable cargo of silk was not delayed but was quickly transferred to\r\nthe shore. His diary is illustrated with a drawing of the Treasury\r\nflag on the customs launch which acted as go-between for their boat\r\nand the shore. Finally, the first-class passengers were allowed to\r\nland, and he went to the Palace Hotel.\r\n\r\nWith little delay, the overland journey was begun; the scenery through\r\nthe picturesque Rocky Mountains especially impressed him, and finally\r\nChicago was reached. The thing that struck him most forcibly in that\r\ncity was the large number of cigar stores with an Indian in front of\r\neach--and apparently no two Indians alike. The unexpressed idea was\r\nthat in America the remembrance of the first inhabitants of the land\r\nand their dress was retained and popularized, while in the Philippines\r\nknowledge of the first inhabitants of the land was to be had only\r\nfrom foreign museums.\r\n\r\nNiagara Falls is the next impression recorded in the diary, which has\r\nbeen preserved and is now in the Newberry Library of Chicago. The\r\nsame strange, awe-inspiring mystery which others have found in the\r\nbig falls affected him, but characteristically he compared this\r\nworld-wonder with the cascades of his native La Laguna, claiming for\r\nthem greater delicacy and a daintier enchantment.\r\n\r\nFrom Albany, the train ran along the banks of the Hudson, and he was\r\nreminded of the Pasig in his homeland, with its much greater commerce\r\nand its constant activity.\r\n\r\nAt New York, Rizal embarked on the City of Rome, then the finest\r\nsteamer in the world, and after a pleasant voyage, in which his spare\r\nmoments were occupied in rereading \"Gulliver's Travels\" in English,\r\nRizal reached England, and said good-by to the friends whom he had\r\nmet during their brief ocean trip together.\r\n\r\nRizal's first letters home to his family speak of being in the free\r\nair of England and once more amidst European activity. For a short\r\ntime he lived with Doctor Antonio Maria Regidor, an exile of '72,\r\nwho had come to secure what Spanish legal Business he could in the\r\nBritish metropolis. Doctor Regidor was formerly an official in the\r\nPhilippines, and later proved his innocence of any complicity in the\r\ntroubles of '72.\r\n\r\nDoctor Rizal then boarded with a Mr. Beckett, organist of St. Paul's\r\nChurch, at 37 Charlecote Crescent, in the favorite North West residence\r\nsection. The zooelogical gardens were conveniently near and the British\r\nMuseum was within easy walking distance. The new member was a favorite\r\nwith all the family, which consisted of three daughters besides the\r\nfather and mother.\r\n\r\nRizal's youthful interest in sleight-of-hand tricks was still\r\nmaintained. During his stay in the Philippines he had sometimes amused\r\nhis friends in this way, till one day he was horrified to find that\r\nthe simple country folk, who were also looking on, thought that he\r\nwas working miracles. In London he resumed his favorite diversion, and\r\na Christmas gift of Mrs. Beckett to him, \"The Life and Adventures of\r\nValentine Vox the Ventriloquist,\" indicated the interest his friends\r\ntook in this amusement. One of his own purchases was \"Modern Magic,\"\r\nthe frontispiece of which is the sphinx that figures in the story of\r\n\"El Filibusterismo.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Rizal's custom to study the deceptions practiced upon the\r\npeoples of other lands, comparing them with those of which his\r\nown countrymen had been victims. Thus he could get an idea of the\r\nrelative credulity of different peoples and could also account\r\nfor many practices the origin of which was otherwise less easy to\r\nunderstand. His investigations were both in books and by personal\r\nresearch. In quest of these experiences he one day chanced to visit\r\na professional phrenologist; the bump-reader was a shrewd guesser,\r\nfor he dwelt especially upon Rizal's aptitude for learning languages\r\nand advised him to take up the study of them.\r\n\r\nThis interest in languages, shown in his childish ambition to be\r\nlike Sir John Bowring, made Rizal a congenial companion of a still\r\nmore distinguished linguist, Doctor Reinhold Rost, the librarian of\r\nthe India Office. The Raffles Library in Singapore now owns Doctor\r\nRost's library, and its collection of grammars in seventy languages\r\nattests the wide range of the studies of this Sanscrit scholar.\r\n\r\nDoctor Rost was born and educated in Germany, though naturalized\r\nas a British subject, and he was a man of great musical taste. His\r\nfamily sometimes formed an orchestra, at other times a glee club, and\r\nfurnished all the necessary parts from its own members. Rizal was a\r\nfrequent visitor, usually spending his Sundays in athletic exercises\r\nwith the boys, for he quickly became proficient in the English sports\r\nof boxing and cricket. While resting he would converse with the father,\r\nor chat with the daughters of the home. All the children had literary\r\ntastes, and one, Daisy, presented him with a copy of a novel which\r\nshe had just translated from the German, entitled \"Ulli.\"\r\n\r\nSome idea of Doctor Rizal's own linguistic attainments may be gained\r\nfrom the fact that instead of writing letters to his nephews and nieces\r\nhe made for them translations of some of Hans Christian Andersen's\r\nfairy tales. They consist of some forty manuscript pages, profusely\r\nillustrated, and the father is referred to in a \"dedication,\"\r\nas though it were a real book. The Hebrew Bible quotation is in\r\nallusion to a jocose remark once made by the father that German was\r\nlike Hebrew to him, the verse being that in which the sons of Jacob,\r\nnot recognizing that their brother was the seller, were bargaining\r\nfor some of Pharaoh's surplus corn, \"And he (Joseph) said, How is\r\nthe old man, your father?\" Rizal always tried to relieve by a touch\r\nof humor anything that seemed to him as savoring of affectation,\r\nthe phase of Spanish character that repelled him and the imitation\r\nof which by his countrymen who knew nothing of the un-Spanish world\r\ndisgusted him with them.\r\n\r\nAnother example of his versatility in language and of its usefulness\r\nto him as well, is shown in a trilingual letter written by Rizal in\r\nDapitan when the censorship of his correspondence had become annoying\r\nthrough ignorant exceptions to perfectly harmless matters. No Spaniard\r\navailable spoke more than one language besides his own and it was\r\nnecessary to send the letter to three different persons to find out\r\nits contents. The critics took the hint and Rizal received better\r\ntreatment thereafter.\r\n\r\nAnother one of Rizal's youthful aspirations was attained in London,\r\nfor there he began transcribing the early Spanish history by Morga of\r\nwhich Sir John Bowring had told his uncle. A copy of this rare book\r\nwas in the British Museum and he gained admission as a reader there\r\nthrough the recommendation of Doctor Rost. Only five hundred persons\r\ncan be accommodated in the big reading room, and as students are\r\ncoming from every continent for special researches, good reason has\r\nto be shown why these studies cannot be made at some other institution.\r\n\r\nBesides the copying of the text of Morga's history, Rizal read\r\nmany other early writings on the Philippines, and the manifest\r\nunfairness of some of these who thought that they could glorify Spain\r\nonly by disparaging the Filipinos aroused his wrath. Few Spanish\r\nwriters held up the good name of those who were under their flag,\r\nand Rizal had to resort to foreign authorities to disprove their\r\nlibels. Morga was almost alone among Spanish historians, but his\r\nassertions found corroboration in the contemporary chronicles of\r\nother nationalities. Rizal spent his evenings in the home of Doctor\r\nRegidor, and many a time the bitterness and impatience with which his\r\nday's work in the Museum had inspired him, would be forgotten as the\r\nolder man counseled patience and urged that such prejudices were to be\r\nexpected of a little educated nation. Then Rizal's brow would clear as\r\nhe quoted his favorite proverb, \"To understand all is to forgive all.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Rost was editor of Truebner's Record, a journal devoted to the\r\nliterature of the East, founded by the famous Oriental Bookseller and\r\nPublisher of London, Nicholas Truebner, and Doctor Rizal contributed\r\nto it in May, 1889, some specimens of Tagal folklore, an extract from\r\nwhich is appended, as it was then printed:\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecimens of Tagal Folklore\r\n\r\nBy Doctor J. Rizal\r\n\r\n\r\nProverbial Sayings\r\n\r\nMalakas ang bulong sa sigaw, Low words are stronger than loud words.\r\n\r\nAng laki sa layaw karaniwa 'y hubad, A petted child is generally naked\r\n(i.e. poor).\r\n\r\nHampasng magulang ay nakataba, Parents' punishment makes one fat.\r\n\r\nIbang hari ibang ugail, New king, new fashion.\r\n\r\nNagpuputol ang kapus, ang labis ay nagdurugtong, What is short cuts\r\noff a piece from itself, what is long adds another on (the poor gets\r\npoorer, the rich richer).\r\n\r\nAng nagsasabing tapus ay siyang kinakapus, He who finishes his words\r\nfinds himself wanting.\r\n\r\nNangangako habang napapako, Man promises while in need.\r\n\r\nAng naglalakad ng marahan, matinik may mababaw, He who walks slowly,\r\nthough he may put his foot on a thorn, will not be hurt very much\r\n(Tagals mostly go barefooted).\r\n\r\nAng maniwala sa sabi 'y walang bait na sarili, He who believes in\r\ntales has no own mind.\r\n\r\nAng may isinuksok sa dingding, ay may titingalain, He who has put\r\nsomething between the wall may afterwards look on (the saving man\r\nmay afterwards be cheerful).--The wall of a Tagal house is made of\r\npalm-leaves and bamboo, so that it can be used as a cupboard.\r\n\r\nWalang mahirap gisingin na paris nang nagtutulogtulugan, The most\r\ndifficult to rouse from sleep is the man who pretends to be asleep.\r\n\r\nLabis sa salita, kapus sa gawa, Too many words, too little work.\r\n\r\nHipong tulog ay nadadala ng anod, The sleeping shrimp is carried away\r\nby the current.\r\n\r\nSa bibig nahuhuli ang isda, The fish is caught through the mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nPuzzles\r\n\r\nIsang butil na palay sikip sa buony bahay, One rice-corn fills up\r\nall the house.--The light. The rice-corn with the husk is yellowish.\r\n\r\nMatapang ako so dalawa, duag ako sa isa, I am brave against two,\r\ncoward against one.--The bamboo bridge. When the bridge is made of\r\none bamboo only, it is difficult to pass over; but when it is made\r\nof two or more, it is very easy.\r\n\r\nDala ako niya, dala ko siya, He carries me, I carry him.--The shoes.\r\n\r\nIsang balong malalim puna ng patalim, A deep well filled with steel\r\nblades.--The mouth.\r\n\r\nThe Filipino colony in Spain had established a fortnightly review,\r\npublished first in Barcelona and later in Madrid, to enlighten\r\nSpaniards on their distant colony, and Rizal wrote for it from the\r\nstart. Its name, La Solidaridad, perhaps may be translated Equal\r\nRights, as it aimed at like laws and the same privileges for the\r\nPeninsula and the possessions overseas.\r\n\r\nFrom the Philippines came news of a contemptible attempt to reach\r\nRizal through his family--one of many similar petty persecutions. His\r\nsister Lucia's husband had died and the corpse was refused interment\r\nin consecrated ground, upon the pretext that the dead man, who had been\r\nexceptionally liberal to the church and was of unimpeachable character,\r\nhad been negligent in his religious duties. Another individual with\r\na notorious record of longer absence from confession died about\r\nthe same time, and his funeral took place from the church without\r\ndemur. The ugly feature about the refusal to bury Hervosa was that the\r\ntelegram from the friar parish-priest to the Archbishop at Manila in\r\nasking instructions, was careful to mention that the deceased was a\r\nbrother-in-law of Rizal. Doctor Rizal wrote a scorching article for\r\nLa Solidaridad under the caption \"An Outrage,\" and took the matter\r\nup with the Spanish Colonial Minister, then Becerra, a professed\r\nLiberal. But that weakling statesman, more liberal in words than in\r\nactions, did nothing.\r\n\r\nThat the union of Church and State can be as demoralizing to religion\r\nas it is disastrous to good government seems sufficiently established\r\nby Philippine incidents like this, in which politics was substituted\r\nfor piety as the test of a good Catholic, making marriage impossible\r\nand denying decent burial to the families of those who differed\r\npolitically with the ministers of the national religion.\r\n\r\nOf all his writings, the article in which Rizal speaks of this\r\nindignity to the dead comes nearest to exhibiting personal feeling and\r\nrancor. Yet his main point is to indicate generally what monstrous\r\nconditions the Philippine mixture of religion and politics made\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe following are part of a series of nineteen verses published in\r\nLa Solidaridad over Rizal's favorite pen name of Laong Laan:\r\n\r\n\r\n  To my Muse\r\n\r\n  (translation by Charles Derbyshire)\r\n\r\n  Invoked no longer is the Muse,\r\n  The lyre is out of date;\r\n  The poets it no longer use,\r\n  And youth its inspiration now imbues\r\n  With other form and state.\r\n\r\n  If today our fancies aught\r\n  Of verse would still require,\r\n  Helicon's hill remains unsought;\r\n  And without heed we but inquire,\r\n  Why the coffee is not brought.\r\n\r\n  In the place of thought sincere\r\n  That our hearts may feel,\r\n  We must seize a pen of steel,\r\n  And with verse and line severe\r\n  Fling abroad a jest and jeer.\r\n\r\n  Muse, that in the past inspired me,\r\n  And with songs of love hast fired me;\r\n  Go thou now to dull repose,\r\n  For today in sordid prose\r\n  I must earn the gold that hired me.\r\n\r\n  Now must I ponder deep,\r\n  Meditate, and struggle on;\r\n  E'en sometimes I must weep;\r\n  For he who love would keep\r\n  Great pain has undergone.\r\n\r\n  Fled are the days of ease,\r\n  The days of Love's delight;\r\n  When flowers still would please\r\n  And give to suffering souls surcease\r\n  From pain and sorrow's blight.\r\n\r\n  One by one they have passed on,\r\n  All I loved and moved among;\r\n  Dead or married--from me gone,\r\n  For all I place my heart upon\r\n  By fate adverse are stung.\r\n\r\n  Go thou, too, O Muse, depart,\r\n  Other regions fairer find;\r\n  For my land but offers art\r\n  For the laurel, chains that bind,\r\n  For a temple, prisons blind.\r\n\r\n  But before thou leavest me, speak:\r\n  Tell me with thy voice sublime,\r\n  Thou couldst ever from me seek\r\n  A song of sorrow for the weak,\r\n  Defiance to the tyrant's crime.\r\n\r\n\r\nRizal's congenial situation in the British capital was disturbed\r\nby his discovering a growing interest in the youngest of the three\r\ngirls whom he daily met. He felt that his career did not permit him\r\nto marry, nor was his youthful affection for his cousin in Manila an\r\nentirely forgotten sentiment. Besides, though he never lapsed into\r\nsuch disregard for his feminine friends as the low Spanish standard\r\nhad made too common among the Filipino students in Madrid, Rizal was\r\never on his guard against himself. So he suggested to Doctor Regidor\r\nthat he considered it would be better for him to leave London. His\r\nparting gift to the family with whom he had lived so happily was a\r\nclay medallion bearing in relief the profiles of the three sisters.\r\n\r\nOther regretful good-bys were said to a number of young Filipinos\r\nwhom he had gathered around him and formed into a club for the study\r\nof the history of their country and the discussion of its politics.\r\n\r\nRizal now went to Paris, where he was glad to be again with his friend\r\nValentin Ventura, a wealthy Pampangan who had been trained for the\r\nlaw. His tastes and ideals were very much those of Rizal, and he had\r\nsound sense and a freedom from affectation which especially appealed\r\nto Rizal. There Rizal's reprint of Morga's rare history was made, at\r\na greater cost but also in better form than his first novel. Copious\r\nnotes gave references to other authorities and compared present\r\nwith past conditions, and Doctor Blumentritt contributed a forceful\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nWhen Rizal returned to London to correct the proofsheets, the old\r\noriginal book was in use and the copy could not be checked. This led to\r\na number of errors, misspelled and changed words, and even omissions\r\nof sentences, which were afterwards discovered and carefully listed\r\nand filed away to be corrected in another edition.\r\n\r\nPossibly it has been made clear already that, while Rizal did not\r\nwork for separation from Spain, he was no admirer of the Castilian\r\ncharacter, nor of the Latin type, for that matter. He remarked on\r\nBlumentritt's comparison of the Spanish rulers in the Philippines\r\nwith the Czars of Russia, that it is flattering to the Castilians\r\nbut it is more than they merit, to put them in the same class as\r\nRussia. Apparently he had in mind the somewhat similar comparison in\r\nBurke's speech on the conciliation of America, in which he said that\r\nRussia was more advanced and less cruel than Spain and so not to be\r\nclassed with it.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in Paris, Rizal was a frequent visitor at the home\r\nof the two Doctors Pardo de Tavera, sons of the exile of '72 who\r\nhad gone to France, the younger now a physician in South America,\r\nthe elder a former Philippine Commissioner. The interest of the\r\none in art, and of the other in philology, the ideas of progress\r\nthrough education shared by both, and many other common tastes and\r\nideals, made the two young men fast friends of Rizal. Mrs. Tavera,\r\nthe mother, was an interesting conversationalist, and Rizal profited\r\nby her reminiscences of Philippine official life, to the inner circle\r\nof which her husband's position had given her the entree.\r\n\r\nOn Sundays Rizal fenced at Juan Luna's house with his distinguished\r\nartist-countryman, or, while the latter was engaged with Ventura,\r\nwatched their play. It was on one of these afternoons that the Tagalog\r\nstory of \"The Monkey and the Tortoise\"[2] was hastily sketched as a\r\njoke to fill the remaining pages of Mrs. Luna's autograph album, in\r\nwhich she had been insisting Rizal must write before all its space\r\nwas used up. A comparison of the Tagalog version with a Japanese\r\ncounterpart was published by Rizal in English, in Truebner's Magazine,\r\nsuggesting that the two people may have had a common origin. This\r\nstudy received considerable attention from other ethnologists, and\r\nwas among the topics at an ethnological conference.\r\n\r\nAt times his antagonist was Miss Nellie Baustead, who had great\r\nskill with the foils. Her father, himself born in the Philippines,\r\nthe son of a wealthy merchant of Singapore, had married a member of\r\nthe Genato family of Manila. At their villa in Biarritz, and again\r\nin their home in Belgium, Rizal was a guest later, for Mr. Baustead\r\nhad taken a great liking to him.\r\n\r\nThe teaching instinct that led him to act as mentor to the Filipino\r\nstudents in Spain and made him the inspiration of a mutual improvement\r\nclub of his young countrymen in London, suggested the foundation of\r\na school in Paris. Later a Pampangan youth offered him $40,000 with\r\nwhich to found a Filipino college in Hongkong, where many young men\r\nfrom the Philippines had obtained an education better than their\r\nown land could afford but not entirely adapted to their needs. The\r\nscheme attracted Rizal, and a prospectus for such an institution\r\nwhich was later found among his papers not only proves how deeply\r\nhe was interested, but reveals the fact that his ideas of education\r\nwere essentially like those carried out in the present public-school\r\ncourse of instruction in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nEarly in August of 1890 Rizal went to Madrid to seek redress for a\r\nwrong done his family by the notorious General Weyler, the \"Butcher\"\r\nof evil memory in Cuba, then Governor-General of the Philippines. Just\r\nas the mother's loss of liberty, years before, was caused by revengeful\r\nfeelings on the part of an official because for one day she was obliged\r\nto omit a customary gift of horse feed, so the father's loss of land\r\nwas caused by a revengeful official, and for quite as trivial a cause.\r\n\r\nMr. Mercado was a great poultry fancier and especially prided himself\r\nupon his fine stock of turkeys. He had been accustomed to respond to\r\nthe frequent requests of the estate agent for presents of birds. But\r\nat one time disease had so reduced the number of turkeys that all that\r\nremained were needed for breeding purposes and Mercado was obliged\r\nto refuse him. In a rage the agent insisted, and when that proved\r\nunavailing, threats followed.\r\n\r\nBut Francisco Mercado was not a man to be moved by threats, and\r\nwhen the next rent day came round he was notified that his rent had\r\nbeen doubled. This was paid without protest, for the tenants were\r\nentirely at the mercy of the landlords, no fixed rate appearing\r\neither in contracts or receipts. Then the rent-raising was kept on\r\ntill Mercado was driven to seek the protection of the courts. Part\r\nof his case led to exactly the same situation as that of the Binan\r\ntenantry in his grandfather's time, when the landlords were compelled\r\nto produce their title-deeds, and these proved that land of others\r\nhad been illegally included in the estate. Other tenants, emboldened\r\nby Mercado's example also refused to pay the exorbitant rent increases.\r\n\r\nThe justice of the peace of Kalamba, before whom the case first came,\r\nwas threatened by the provincial governor for taking time to hear the\r\ntestimony, and the case was turned over to the auxiliary justice, who\r\npromptly decided in the manner desired by the authorities. Mercado at\r\nonce took an appeal, but the venal Weyler moved a force of artillery\r\nto Kalamba and quartered it upon the town as if rebellion openly\r\nexisted there. Then the court representatives evicted the people\r\nfrom their homes and directed them to remove all their buildings\r\nfrom the estate lands within twenty-four hours. In answer to the\r\nplea that they had appealed to the Supreme Court the tenants were\r\ntold their houses could be brought back again if they won their\r\nappeal. Of course this was impossible and some 150,000 pesos' worth\r\nof property was consequently destroyed by the court agents, who were\r\nworthy estate employees. Twenty or more families were made homeless\r\nand the other tenants were forbidden to shelter them under pain of\r\ntheir own eviction. This is the proceeding in which Retana suggests\r\nthat the governor-general and the landlords were legally within their\r\nrights. If so, Spanish law was a disgrace to the nation. Fortunately\r\nthe Rizal-Mercado family had another piece of property at Los Banos,\r\nand there they made their home.\r\n\r\nWeyler's motives in this matter do not have to be surmised, for\r\namong the (formerly) secret records of the government there exists\r\na letter which he wrote when he first denied the petition of the\r\nKalamba residents. It is marked \"confidential\" and is addressed to the\r\nlandlords, expressing the pleasure which this action gave him. Then\r\nthe official adds that it cannot have escaped their notice that the\r\ntimes demand diplomacy in handling the situation but that, should\r\noccasion arise, he will act with energy. Just as Weyler had favored\r\nthe landlords at first so he kept on and when he had a chance to do\r\nsomething for them he did it.\r\n\r\nFinally, when Weyler left the Islands an investigation was ordered into\r\nhis administration, owing to rumors of extensive and systematic frauds\r\non the government, but nothing more came of the case than that Retana,\r\nlater Rizal's biographer, wrote a book in the General's defense,\r\n\"extensively documented,\" and also abusively anti-Filipino. It has been\r\nurged (not by Retana, however) that the Weyler regime was unusually\r\nefficient, because he would allow no one but himself to make profits\r\nout of the public, and therefore, while his gains were greater than\r\nthose of his predecessors, the Islands really received more attention\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nDuring the Kalamba discussion in Spain, Retana, until 1899 always\r\nscurrilously anti-Filipino, made the mistake of his life, for he\r\ncharged Rizal's family with not paying their rent, which was not\r\ntrue. While Rizal believed that duelling was murder, to judge from a\r\npair of pictures preserved in his album, he evidently considered that\r\nhomicide of one like Retana was justifiable. After the Spanish custom,\r\nhis seconds immediately called upon the author of the libel. Retana\r\nnotes in his \"Vida del Dr. Rizal\" that the incident closed in a way\r\nhonorable to both Rizal and himself--he, Retana, published an explicit\r\nretraction and abject apology in the Madrid papers. Another time,\r\nin Madrid, Rizal risked a duel when he challenged Antonio Luna,\r\nlater the General, because of a slighting allusion to a lady at a\r\npublic banquet. He had a nicer sense of honor in such matters than\r\nprevailed in Madrid, and Luna promptly saw the matter from Rizal's\r\npoint of view and withdrew the offensive remark. This second incident\r\ncomplements the first, for it shows that Rizal was as willing to risk a\r\nduel with his superior in arms as with one not so skilled as he. Rizal\r\nwas an exceptional pistol shot and a fair swordsman, while Retana was\r\ninferior with either sword or pistol, but Luna, who would have had the\r\nchoice of weapons, was immeasurably Rizal's superior with the sword.\r\n\r\nOwing to a schism a rival arose against the old Masonry and finally\r\nthe original organization succumbed to the offshoot. Doctor Miguel\r\nMorayta, Professor of History in the Central University at Madrid, was\r\nthe head of the new institution and it had grown to be very popular\r\namong students. Doctor Morayta was friendly to the Filipinos and a\r\nlodge of the same name as their paper was organized among them. For\r\ntheir outside work they had a society named the Hispano-Filipino\r\nAssociation, of which Morayta was president, with convenient clubrooms\r\nand a membership practically the same as the Lodge La Solidaridad.\r\n\r\nJust before Christmas of 1890, this Hispano-Filipino Association\r\ngave a largely attended banquet at which there were many prominent\r\nspeakers. Rizal stayed away, not because of growing pessimism,\r\nas Retana suggests, but because one of the speakers was the same\r\nBecerra who had feared to act when the outrage against the body of\r\nRizal's brother-in-law had been reported to him. Now out of office,\r\nthe ex-minister was again bold in words, but Rizal for one was not\r\nagain to be deceived by them.\r\n\r\nThe propaganda carried on by his countrymen in the Peninsula did not\r\nseem to Rizal effective, and he found his suggestions were not well\r\nreceived by those at its head. The story of Rizal's separation from\r\nLa Solidaridad, however, is really not material, but the following\r\nquotation from a letter written to Carlos Oliver, speaking of the\r\nopposition of the Madrid committee of Filipinos to himself, is\r\ninteresting as showing Rizal's attitude of mind:\r\n\r\n\"I regret exceedingly that they war against me, attempting to discredit\r\nme in the Philippines, but I shall be content provided only that my\r\nsuccessor keeps on with the work. I ask only of those who say that\r\nI created discord among the Filipinos: Was there any effective union\r\nbefore I entered political life? Was there any chief whose authority\r\nI wanted to oppose? It is a pity that in our slavery we should have\r\nrivalries over leadership.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in Rizal's letter from Hongkong, May 24, 1892, to Zulueta,\r\ncommenting on an article by Leyte in La Solidaridad, he says:\r\n\r\n\"Again I repeat, I do not understand the reason of the attack, since\r\nnow I have dedicated myself to preparing for our countrymen a safe\r\nrefuge in case of persecution and to writing some books, championing\r\nour cause, which shortly will appear. Besides, the article is impolitic\r\nin the extreme and prejudicial to the Philippines. Why say that the\r\nfirst thing we need is to have money? A wiser man would be silent\r\nand not wash soiled linen in public.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in '91 Rizal went to Paris, visiting Mr. Baustead's villa in\r\nBiarritz en route, and he was again a guest of his hospitable friend\r\nwhen, after the winter season was over, the family returned to their\r\nhome in Brussels.\r\n\r\nDuring most of the year Rizal's residence was in Ghent, where he had\r\ngathered around him a number of Filipinos. Doctor Blumentritt suggested\r\nthat he should devote himself to the study of Malay-Polynesian\r\nlanguages, and as it appeared that thus he could earn a living in\r\nHolland he thought to make his permanent home there. But his parents\r\nwere old and reluctant to leave their native land to pass their last\r\nyears in a strange country, and that plan failed.\r\n\r\nHe now occupied himself in finishing the sequel to \"Noli Me Tangere,\"\r\nthe novel \"El Filibusterismo,\" which he had begun in October of 1887\r\nwhile on his visit to the Philippines. The bolder painting of the\r\nevil effects of the Spanish culture upon the Filipinos may well have\r\nbeen inspired by his unfortunate experiences with his countrymen in\r\nMadrid who had not seen anything of Europe outside of Spain. On the\r\nother hand, the confidence of the author in those of his countrymen\r\nwho had not been contaminated by the so-called Spanish civilization,\r\nis even more noticeable than in \"Noli Me Tangere.\"\r\n\r\nRizal had now done all that he could for his country; he had shown\r\nthem by Morga what they were when Spain found them; through \"Noli Me\r\nTangere\" he had painted their condition after three hundred years of\r\nSpanish influence; and in \"El Filibusterismo\" he had pictured what\r\ntheir future must be if better counsels did not prevail in the colony.\r\n\r\nThese works were for the instruction of his countrymen, the fulfilment\r\nof the task he set for himself when he first read Doctor Jagor's\r\ncriticism fifteen years before; time only was now needed for them to\r\naccomplish their work and for education to bring forth its fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nDespujol's Duplicity\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had set in motion what influence he possessed in Europe\r\nfor the relief of his relatives, Rizal hurried to Hongkong and from\r\nthere wrote to his parents asking their permission to join them. Some\r\ntime before, his brother-in-law, Manuel Hidalgo, had been deported\r\nupon the recommendation of the governor of La Laguna, \"to prove to\r\nthe Filipinos that they were mistaken in thinking that the new Civil\r\nCode gave them any rights\" in cases where the governor-general agreed\r\nwith his subordinate's reason for asking for the deportation as well\r\nas in its desirability. The offense was having buried a child, who\r\nhad died of cholera, without church ceremonies. The law prescribed\r\nand public health demanded it. But the law was a dead letter and the\r\npublic health was never considered when these cut into church revenues,\r\nas Hidalgo ought to have known.\r\n\r\nUpon Rizal's arrival in Hongkong, in the fall of 1891, he received\r\nnotice that his brother Paciano had been returned from exile in\r\nMindoro, but that three of his sisters had been summoned, with the\r\nprobability of deportation.\r\n\r\nA trap to get Rizal into the hands of the government by playing\r\nupon his affection for his mother was planned at this time, but it\r\nfailed. Mrs. Rizal and one of her daughters were arrested in Manila\r\nfor \"falsification of cedula\" because they no longer used the name\r\nRealonda, which the mother had dropped fifteen years before. Then,\r\nthough there were frequently boats running to Kalamba, the two women\r\nwere ordered to be taken there for trial on foot. As when Mrs. Rizal\r\nhad been a prisoner before, the humane guards disobeyed their orders\r\nand the elderly lady was carried in a hammock. The family understood\r\nthe plans of their persecutors, and Rizal was told by his parents\r\nnot to come to Manila. Then the persecution of the mother and the\r\nsister dropped.\r\n\r\nIn Hongkong, Rizal was already acquainted with most of the Filipino\r\ncolony, including Jose M. Basa, a '72 exile of great energy, for whom\r\nhe had the greatest respect. The old man was an unceasing enemy of all\r\nthe religious orders and was constantly getting out \"proclamations,\"\r\nas the handbills common in the old-time controversies were called. One\r\nof these, against the Jesuits, figures in the case against Rizal\r\nand bears some minor corrections in his handwriting. Nevertheless,\r\nhis participation in it was probably no more than this proofreading\r\nfor his friend, whose motives he could appreciate, but whose plan of\r\naction was not in harmony with his own ideas.\r\n\r\nLetters of introduction from London friends secured for Rizal the\r\nacquaintance of Mr. H. L. Dalrymple, a justice of the peace--which is\r\na position more coveted and honored in English lands than here--and\r\na member of the public library committee, as well as of the board\r\nof medical examiners. He was a merchant, too, and agent for the\r\nBritish North Borneo Company, which had recently secured a charter\r\nas a semi-independent colony for the extensive cession which had\r\noriginally been made to the American Trading Company and later\r\ntransferred to them.\r\n\r\nRizal spent much of his time in the library, reading especially the\r\nfiles of the older newspapers, which contained frequent mention of\r\nthe Philippines. As an oldtime missionary had left his books to the\r\nlibrary, the collection was rich in writings of the fathers of the\r\nearly Church, as well as in philology and travel. He spent much time\r\nalso in long conversations with Editor Frazier-Smith of the Hongkong\r\nTelegraph, the most enterprising of the daily newspapers. He was\r\nthe master of St. John's Masonic lodge (Scotch constitution), which\r\nRizal had visited upon his first arrival, intensely democratic and\r\na close student of world politics. The two became fast friends and\r\nRizal contributed to the Telegraph several articles on Philippine\r\nmatters. These were printed in Spanish, ostensibly for the benefit of\r\nthe Filipino colony in Hongkong, but large numbers of the paper were\r\nmailed to the Philippines and thus at first escaped the vigilance\r\nof the censors. Finally the scheme was discovered and the Telegraph\r\nplaced on the prohibited list, but, like most Spanish actions, this\r\nwas just too late to prevent the circulation of what Rizal had wished\r\nto say to his countrymen.\r\n\r\nWith the first of the year 1892 the free portion of Rizal's family came\r\nto Hongkong. He had been licensed to practice medicine in the colony,\r\nand opened an office, specializing as an oculist with notable success.\r\n\r\nAnother congenial companion was a man of his own profession, Doctor\r\nL. P. Marquez, a Portuguese who had received his medical education in\r\nDublin and was a naturalized British subject. He was a leading member\r\nof the Portuguese club, Lusitania, which was of radically republican\r\nproclivities and possessed an excellent library of books on modern\r\npolitical conditions. An inspection of the colonial prison with him\r\ninspired Rizal's article, \"A Visit to Victoria Gaol,\" through which\r\nruns a pathetic contrast of the English system of imprisonment for\r\nreformation with the Spanish vindictive methods of punishment. A\r\nsouvenir of one of their many conferences was a dainty modeling in\r\nclay made by Rizal with that astonishing quickness that resulted from\r\nhis Uncle Gabriel's training during his early childhood.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, Rizal took a voyage to British North Borneo and with\r\nMr. Pryor, the agent, looked over vacant lands which had been offered\r\nhim by the Company for a Filipino colony. The officials were anxious\r\nto grow abaca, cacao, sugar cane and coconuts, all products of the\r\nPhilippines, the soil of which resembled theirs. So they welcomed the\r\nprospect of the immigration of laborers skilled in such cultivation,\r\nthe Kalambans and other persecuted people of the Luzon lake region,\r\nwhom Doctor Rizal hoped to transplant there to a freer home.\r\n\r\nA different kind of governor-general had succeeded Weyler in the\r\nPhilippines; the new man was Despujol, a friend of the Jesuits\r\nand a man who at once gave the Filipinos hope of better days,\r\nfor his promises were quickly backed up by the beginnings of their\r\nperformance. Rizal witnessed this novel experience for his country\r\nwith gratification, though he had seen too many disappointments to\r\nconfide in the continuance of reform, and he remembered that the like\r\nliberal term of De la Torre had ended in the Cavite reaction.\r\n\r\nHe wrote early to the new chief executive, applauding Despujol's policy\r\nand offering such cooeperation as he might be able to give toward\r\nmaking it a complete success. No reply had been received, but after\r\nRizal's return from his Borneo trip the Spanish consul in Hongkong\r\nassured him that he would not be molested should he go to Manila.\r\n\r\nRizal therefore made up his mind to visit his home once more. He\r\nstill cherished the plan of transferring those of his relatives\r\nand friends who were homeless through the land troubles, or\r\ndiscontented with their future in the Philippines, to the district\r\noffered to him by the British North Borneo Company. There, under the\r\nprotection of the British flag, but in their accustomed climate, with\r\nfamiliar surroundings amid their own people, a New Kalamba would be\r\nestablished. Filipinos would there have a chance to prove to the world\r\nwhat they were capable of, and their free condition would inevitably\r\nreact on the neighboring Philippines and help to bring about better\r\ngovernment there.\r\n\r\nRizal had no intention of renouncing his Philippine allegiance, for\r\nhe always regretted the naturalization of his countrymen abroad,\r\nconsidering it a loss to the country which needed numbers to play\r\nthe influential part he hoped it would play in awakening Asia. All\r\nhis arguments were for British justice and \"Equality before the Law,\"\r\nfor he considered that political power was only a means of securing\r\nand assuring fair treatment for all, and in itself of no interest.\r\n\r\nWith such ideas he sailed for home, bearing the Spanish consul's\r\npassport. He left two letters in Hongkong with his friend Doctor\r\nMarquez marked, \"To be opened after my death,\" and their contents\r\nindicate that he was not unmindful of how little regard Spain had\r\nhad in his country for her plighted honor.\r\n\r\nOne was to his beloved parents, brother and sisters, and friends:\r\n\r\n\"The affection that I have ever professed for you suggests this\r\nstep, and time alone can tell whether or not it is sensible. Their\r\noutcome decides things by results, but whether that be favorable or\r\nunfavorable, it may always be said that duty urged me, so if I die\r\nin doing it, it will not matter.\r\n\r\n\"I realize how much suffering I have caused you, still I do not\r\nregret what I have done. Rather, if I had to begin over again, still\r\nI should do just the same, for it has been only duty. Gladly do I go\r\nto expose myself to peril, not as any expiation of misdeeds (for in\r\nthis matter I believe myself guiltless of any), but to complete my\r\nwork and myself offer the example of which I have always preached.\r\n\r\n\"A man ought to die for duty and his principles. I hold fast to\r\nevery idea which I have advanced as to the condition and future of\r\nour country, and shall willingly die for it, and even more willingly\r\nto procure for you justice and peace.\r\n\r\n\"With pleasure, then, I risk life to save so many innocent persons--so\r\nmany nieces and nephews, so many children of friends, and children,\r\ntoo, of others who are not even friends--who are suffering on my\r\naccount. What am I? A single man, practically without family, and\r\nsufficiently undeceived as to life. I have had many disappointments\r\nand the future before me is gloomy, and will be gloomy if light does\r\nnot illuminate it, the dawn of a better day for my native land. On the\r\nother hand, there are many individuals, filled with hope and ambition,\r\nwho perhaps all might be happy were I dead, and then I hope my enemies\r\nwould be satisfied and stop persecuting so many entirely innocent\r\npeople. To a certain extent their hatred is justifiable as to myself,\r\nand my parents and relatives.\r\n\r\n\"Should fate go against me, you will all understand that I shall die\r\nhappy in the thought that my death will end all your troubles. Return\r\nto our country and may you be happy in it.\r\n\r\n\"Till the last moment of my life I shall be thinking of you and\r\nwishing you all good fortune and happiness.\"\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe other letter was directed \"To the Filipinos,\" and said:\r\n\r\n\"The step which I am taking, or rather am about to take, is undoubtedly\r\nrisky, and it is unnecessary to say that I have considered it some\r\ntime. I understand that almost every one is opposed to it; but I know\r\nalso that hardly anybody else comprehends what is in my heart. I cannot\r\nlive on seeing so many suffer unjust persecutions on my account; I\r\ncannot bear longer the sight of my sisters and their numerous families\r\ntreated like criminals. I prefer death and cheerfully shall relinquish\r\nlife to free so many innocent persons from such unjust persecution.\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate that at present the future of our country gravitates\r\nin some degree around me, that at my death many will feel triumphant,\r\nand, in consequence, many are wishing for my fall. But what of it? I\r\nhold duties of conscience above all else, I have obligations to the\r\nfamilies who suffer, to my aged parents whose sighs strike me to the\r\nheart; I know that I alone, only with my death, can make them happy,\r\nreturning them to their native land and to a peaceful life at home. I\r\nam all my parents have, but our country has many, many more sons who\r\ncan take my place and even do my work better.\r\n\r\n\"Besides I wish to show those who deny us patriotism that we know\r\nhow to die for duty and principles. What matters death, if one dies\r\nfor what one loves, for native land and beings held dear?\r\n\r\n\"If I thought that I were the only resource for the policy of progress\r\nin the Philippines and were I convinced that my countrymen were\r\ngoing to make use of my services, perhaps I should hesitate about\r\ntaking this step; but there are still others who can take my place,\r\nwho, too, can take my place with advantage. Furthermore, there are\r\nperchance those who hold me unneeded and my services are not utilized,\r\nresulting that I am reduced to inactivity.\r\n\r\n\"Always have I loved our unhappy land, and I am sure that I shall\r\ncontinue loving it till my latest moment, in case men prove unjust\r\nto me. My career, my life, my happiness, all have I sacrificed for\r\nlove of it. Whatever my fate, I shall die blessing it and longing\r\nfor the dawn of its redemption.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then followed the note; \"Make these letters public after my death.\"\r\n\r\nSuspicion of the Spanish authorities was justified. The consul's\r\ncablegram notifying Governor-General Despujol. that Rizal had fallen\r\ninto their trap, sent the day of issuing the \"safe-conduct\" or special\r\npassport, bears the same date as the secret case filed against him\r\nin Manila, \"for anti religious and anti patriotic agitation.\" On\r\nthat same day the deceitful Despujol was confidentially inquiring\r\nof his executive secretary whether it was true that Rizal had been\r\nnaturalized as a German subject, and, if so, what effect would that\r\nhave on the governor-general's right to take executive action; that\r\nis, could he deport one who had the protection of a strong nation with\r\nthe same disregard for the forms of justice that he could a Filipino?\r\n\r\nThis inquiry is joined to an order to the local authorities in the\r\nprovinces near Manila instructing them to watch the comings and goings\r\nof their prominent people during the following weeks. The scheme\r\nresembled that which was concocted prior to '72, but Governor-General\r\nde la Torte was honest in his reforms. Despujol may, or may not,\r\nhave been honest in other matters, but as concerns Rizal there is\r\nno lack of proof of his perfidy. The confidential file relating to\r\nthis part of the case was forgotten in destroying and removing secret\r\npapers when Manila passed into a democratic conqueror's hands, and\r\nnow whoever wishes may read, in the Bureau of Archives, documents\r\nwhich the Conde de Caspe, to use a noble title for an ignoble man,\r\nconsidered safely hidden. As with Weyler's contidential letter to the\r\nfriar landlords, these discoveries convict their writers of bad faith,\r\nwith no possibility of mistake.\r\n\r\nThis point in the reformed Spanish writer's biography of Rizal is\r\nmade occasion for another of his treacherous attacks upon the good\r\nname of his pretended hero. Just as in the land troubles Retana held\r\nthat legally Governor-General Weyler was justified in disregarding\r\nan appeal pending in the courts, so in this connection he declares:\r\n\"(Despujol) unquestionably had been deceived by Rizal when, from\r\nHongkong, he offered to Despujol not to meddle in politics.\" That\r\nRizal meddled in politics rests solely upon Despujol's word, and\r\nit will be seen later how little that is worth; but, politics or no\r\npolitics, Rizal's fate was settled before he ever came to Manila.\r\n\r\nRizal was accompanied to Manila by his sister Lucia, widow of that\r\nbrother-in-law who had been denied Christian burial because of his\r\nrelationship to Rizal. In the Basa home, among other waste papers,\r\nand for that use, she had gathered up five copies of a recent\r\n\"proclamation,\" entitled \"Pobres Frailes\" (Poor Friars), a small\r\nsheet possibly two inches wide and five long. These, crumpled up,\r\nwere tucked into the case of the pillow which Mrs. Hervosa used on\r\nboard. Later, rolled up in her blankets and bed mat, or petate, they\r\nwent to the custom house along with the other baggage, and of course\r\nwere discovered in the rigorous examination which the officers always\r\nmade. How strict Philippine customs searches were, Henry Norman, an\r\nEnglish writer of travels, explains by remarking that Manila was the\r\nonly port where he had ever had his pockets picked officially. His\r\nvisit was made at about the time of which we are writing, and the\r\nobject, he says, was to keep out anti friar publications.\r\n\r\nRizal and his sister landed without difficulty, and he at once went to\r\nthe Oriente Hotel, then the best in town, for Rizal always traveled\r\nand lived as became a member of a well-to-do family. Next he waited\r\non the Governor-General, with whom he had a very brief interview,\r\nfor it happened to be on one of the numerous religious festivals,\r\nduring which he obtained favorable consideration for his deported\r\nsisters. Several more interviews occurred in which the hopes first\r\ngiven were realized, so that those of the family then awaiting exile\r\nwere pardoned and those already deported were to be returned at an\r\nearly date.\r\n\r\nOne night Rizal was the guest of honor at a dinner given by the masters\r\nand wardens of the Masonic lodges of Manila, and he was surprised and\r\ndelighted at the progress the institution had made in the Islands. Then\r\nhe had another task not so agreeable, for, while awaiting a delayed\r\nappointment with the Governor-General, he with two others ran up on\r\nthe new railway to Tarlac. Ostensibly this was to see the country,\r\nbut it was not for a pleasure trip. They were investigating the sales\r\nof Rizal's books and trying to find out what had become of the money\r\nreceived from them, for while the author's desire had been to place\r\nthem at so low a price as to be within the reach of even the poor, it\r\nwas reported that the sales had been few and at high prices, so that\r\ncopies were only read by the wealthy whose desire to obtain the rare\r\nand much-discussed novels led them to pay exorbitant figures for them.\r\n\r\nRizal's party, consisting of the Secretary of one of the lodges of\r\nManila, and another Mason, a prominent school-teacher, were under\r\nconstant surveillance and a minute record of their every act is\r\npreserved in the \"reserved\" files, now, of course, so only in name,\r\nas they are no longer secret. Immediately after they left a house it\r\nwould be thoroughly searched and the occupants strictly questioned. In\r\nspite of the precautions of the officials, Rizal soon learned of this,\r\nand those whom they visited were warned of what to expect. In one home\r\nso many forbidden papers were on hand that Rizal delayed his journey\r\ntill the family completed their task of carrying them upstairs and\r\nhiding them in the roof.\r\n\r\nAt another place he came across an instance of superstition such as\r\nthat which had caused him to cease his sleight-of-hand exhibitions\r\non his former return to the Islands. Their host was a man of little\r\neducation but great hospitality, and the party were most pleasantly\r\nentertained. During the conversation he spoke of Rizal, but did not\r\nseem to know that his hero had come back to the Philippines. His\r\nremarks drifted into the wildest superstition, and, after asserting\r\nthat Rizal bore a charmed life, he startled his audience by saying\r\nthat if the author of \"Noli Me Tangere\" cared to do so, he could be\r\nwith them at that very instant. At first the three thought themselves\r\ndiscovered by their host, but when Rizal made himself known, the\r\nold man proved that he had had no suspicion of his guest's identity,\r\nfor he promptly became busy preparing his home for the search which\r\nhe realized would shortly follow. On another occasion their host\r\nwas a stranger whom Rizal treated for a temporary illness, leaving\r\na prescription to be filled at the drug store. The name signed to\r\nthe paper was a revelation, but the first result was activity in\r\ncleaning house.\r\n\r\nNo fact is more significant of the utter rottenness of the Spanish\r\nrule than the unanimity of the people in their discontent. Only a\r\nfew persons at first were in open opposition, but books, pamphlets\r\nand circulars were eagerly sought, read and preserved, with the\r\nknowledge generally, of the whole family, despite the danger of\r\npossessing them. At times, as in the case of Rizal's novels, an entire\r\nneighborhood was in the secret; the book was buried in a garden and\r\ndug up to be read from at a gathering of the older men, for which a\r\ndance gave pretext. Informers were so rare that the possibility of\r\ntreachery among themselves was hardly reckoned in the risk.\r\n\r\nThe authorities were constantly searching dwellings, often entire\r\nneighborhoods, and with a thoroughness which entirely disregarded\r\nthe possibility of damaging an innocent person's property. These\r\n\"domiciliary registrations\" were, of course, supposed to be unexpected,\r\nbut in the later Spanish days the intended victims usually had\r\nwarning from some employee in the office where it was planned, or\r\nfrom some domestic of the official in charge; very often, however, the\r\nwarning was so short as to give only time for a hasty destruction of\r\nincriminating documents and did not permit of their being transferred\r\nto other hiding places. Thus large losses were incurred, and to these\r\nmust be added damages from dampness when a hole in the ground, the\r\ninside of a post, or cementing up in the wall furnished the means of\r\nconcealment. Fires, too, were frequent, and such events attracted so\r\nmuch attention that it was scarcely safe to attempt to save anything\r\nof an incriminating nature.\r\n\r\nSix years of war conditions did their part toward destroying what\r\nlittle had escaped, and from these explanations the reader may\r\nunderstand how it comes that the tangled story of Spain's last half\r\ncentury here presents an historical problem more puzzling than that\r\nof much more remote times in more favored lands.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost providential that the published statement of\r\nthe Governor-General can be checked not only by an account which\r\nRizal secretly sent to friends, but also by the candid memoranda\r\ncontained in the untruthful executive's own secret folios. While\r\nsome unessential details of Rizal's career are in doubt, not a point\r\nvital to establishing his good name lacks proof that his character\r\nwas exemplary and that he is worthy of the hero-worship which has\r\ncome to him.\r\n\r\nAfter Rizal's return to Manila from his railway trip he had the\r\npromised interview with the Governor-General. At their previous\r\nmeetings the discussions had been quite informal. Rizal, in\r\ncomplimenting the General upon his inauguration of reforms, mentioned\r\nthat the Philippine system of having no restraint whatever upon\r\nthe chief executive had at least the advantage that a well-disposed\r\ngovernor-general would find no red-tape hindrances to his plans for\r\nthe public benefit. But Despujol professed to believe that the best\r\nof men make mistakes and that a wise government would establish\r\nsafeguards against this human fallibility.\r\n\r\nThe final, and fatal, interview began with the Governor-General asking\r\nRizal if he still persisted in his plan for a Filipino colony in\r\nBritish North Borneo; Despujol had before remarked that with so much\r\nPhilippine land lying idle for want of cultivation it did not seem to\r\nhim patriotic to take labor needed at home away for the development\r\nof a foreign land. Rizal's former reply had dealt with the difficulty\r\nthe government was in respecting the land troubles, since the tenants\r\nwho had taken the old renters' places now also must be considered,\r\nand he pointed out that there was, besides, a bitterness between the\r\nparties which could not easily be forgotten by either side. So this\r\ntime he merely remarked that he had found no reason for changing his\r\noriginal views.\r\n\r\nHereupon the General took from his desk the five little sheets of\r\nthe \"Poor Friars\" handbill, which he said had been found in the roll\r\nof bedding sent with Rizal's baggage to the custom house, and asked\r\nwhose they could be. Rizal answered that of course the General knew\r\nthat the bedding belonged to his sister Lucia, but she was no fool\r\nand would not have secreted in a place where they were certain to be\r\nfound five little papers which, hidden within her camisa or placed\r\nin her stocking, would have been absolutely sure to come in unnoticed.\r\n\r\nRizal, neither then nor later, knew the real truth, which was that\r\nthese papers were gathered up at random and without any knowledge of\r\ntheir contents. If it was a crime to have lived in a house where such\r\nseditious printed matter was common, then Rizal, who had openly visited\r\nBasa's home, was guilty before ever the handbills were found. But no\r\nreasonable person would believe another rational being could be so\r\ncareless of consequences as to bring in openly such dangerous material.\r\n\r\nThe very title was in sarcastic allusion to the inconsistency of a\r\nreligious order being an immensely wealthy organization, while its\r\nindividual members were vowed to poverty. News, published everywhere\r\nexcept in the Philippines, of losses sustained in outside commercial\r\nenterprises running into the millions, was made the text for showing\r\nhow money, professedly raised in the Philippines for charities,\r\nwas not so used and was invested abroad in fear of that day of\r\nreckoning when tyranny would be overthrown in anarchy and property\r\nwould be insecure. The belief of the pious Filipinos, fostered\r\nby their religious exploiters, that the Pope would suffer great\r\nhardship if their share of \"Peter's pence\" was not prompt and full,\r\nwas contrasted with another newspaper story of a rich dowry given\r\nto a favorite niece by a former Pope, but that in no way taught the\r\ntruth that the Head of the Church was not put to bodily discomfort\r\nwhenever a poor Filipino failed to come forward with his penny.\r\n\r\nDespujol managed to work himself into something like a passion over\r\nthis alleged disrespect to the Pope, and ordered Rizal to be taken\r\nas a prisoner to Fort Santiago by the nephew who acted as his aide.\r\n\r\nLike most facts, this version runs a middle course between the extreme\r\nstories which have been current. Like circulars may have been printed\r\nat the \"Asilo de Malabon,\" as has been asserted; these certainly came\r\nfrom Hongkong and were not introduced by any archbishop's nephew on\r\nduty at the custom house, as another tale suggests. On the other hand,\r\nthe circular was the merest pretext, and Despujol did not act in good\r\nfaith, as many claim that he did.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to reprint the handbill from a facsimile of an\r\noriginal copy:\r\n\r\n\r\nPobres Frailes!\r\n\r\nAcaba de suspender sus pages un Banco, acaba de quebrarse el New\r\nOriental.\r\n\r\nGrandes pedidas en la India, en la isla Mauricio al sur de Africa,\r\nciclones y tempestades acabaron con su podeiro, tragnadose mas de\r\n36,000,000 de pesos. Estos treinta y seis millones representaban las\r\nesperanzas, las economias, el bienestar y el porvenir de numerosos\r\nindividuos y familias.\r\n\r\nEntre los que mas han sufrido podemos contar a la Rvda. Corporacion\r\nde los P. P. Dominicos, que pierden en esta quiebra muchos cientos\r\nde miles. No se sabe la cuenta exacta porque tanto dinero se les\r\nenvia de aqui y tantos depositos hacen, que se necesitarlan muchos\r\ncontadores para calcular el immense caudal de que disponen.\r\n\r\nPero, no se aflijan los amigos ni triunfen los enemigos de los santos\r\nmonjes que profesan vote de pobreza.\r\n\r\nA unos y otros les diremos que pueden estar tranquilos. La Corporacion\r\ntiene aun muchos millones depositados en los Bancos de Hongkong, y\r\naunque todos quebrasen, y aunque se derrumbasen sus miles de casas de\r\nalquiler, siempre quedarian sus curates y haciendas, les quedarian los\r\nfilipinos dispuestos siempre a ayunar para darles una limosna. ?Que son\r\ncuatrocientos o quinientos mil? Que se tomen la molestia de recorrer\r\nlos pueblos y pedir limosna y se resarciran de esa perdida. Hace un\r\nano que, por la mala administracion de los cardenales, el Papa perdio\r\n14,000,000 del dinero de San Pedro; el Papa, para cubrir el deficit,\r\nacude a nosotros y nosotros recogemos de nuestros tampipis el ultimo\r\nreal, porque sabemos que el Papa tiene muchas atenciones; hace cosa\r\nde cinco anos caso a una sobrina suya dotandola de un palacio y\r\n300,000 francos ademas. Haced un esfuerzo pues, generosos filipinos,\r\ny socorred a los dominicos igualmente!\r\n\r\nAdemas, esos centanares de miles perdidos no son de ellos, segun dicen:\r\n?como los iban a tener si tienen voto de pobreza? Hay que creerlos\r\npues cuando, para cubrirse, dicen que son de los huerfanos y de las\r\nviudas. Muy seguramente pertencerian algunos a las viudas y a los\r\nhuerfanos de Kalamba, y quien sabe si a los desterrados maridos! y\r\nlos manejan los virtuosos frailes solo a titulo de depositarios para\r\ndevolverlos despues religiosamente con todos sus intereses cuando\r\nllegue el dia de rendir cuentas! Quien sabe? Quien mejor que ellos\r\npodia encargarse de recoger los pocos haberes mientras las casas\r\nardian, huian las viudas y los huerfanos sin encontrar hospitalidad,\r\npues se habia prohibido darles albergue, mientras los hombres estaban\r\npresos o perseguidos? ?Quien mejor que los dominicos para tener tanto\r\nvalor, tanta audacia y tanta humanidad?\r\n\r\nPero, ahora el diablo se ha llevado el dinero de los huerfanos y de\r\nlas viudas, y es de temer que se lleve tambien el resto, pues cuando el\r\ndiablo la empieza la ha de acabar. Tendria ese dinero mala procedencia?\r\n\r\nSi asl sucediese, nosotros los recomendariamos a los dominicos que\r\ndijesen con Job: Desnudo sali del vientre de mi madre (Espana),\r\ny desnudo volvere alla; lo dio el diablo, el diablo se lo llevo;\r\nbendito sea el nombre del Senor!\r\n\r\nFr. Jacinto.\r\n\r\nManila: Imprenta de los Amigos del Pais.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nThe Deportation to Dapitan\r\n\r\nAs soon as Rizal was lodged in his prison, a room in Fort Santiago, the\r\nGovernor-General began the composition of one of the most extraordinary\r\nofficial documents ever issued in this land where the strangest\r\ngovernmental acts have abounded. It is apology, argument, and attack\r\nall in one and was published in the Official Gazette, where it occupied\r\nmost of an entire issue. The effect of the righteous anger it displays\r\nsuffers somewhat when one knows how all was planned from the day Rizal\r\nwas decoyed from Hongkong under the faithless safe-conduct. Another\r\nenlightening feature is the copy of a later letter, preserved in that\r\ninvaluable secret file, wherein Despujol writes Rizal's custodian, as\r\njailer, to allow the exile in no circumstances to see this number of\r\nthe Gazette or to know its contents, and suggests several evasions to\r\nassist the subordinate's power of invention. It is certainly a strange\r\nindignation which fears that its object shall learn the reason for\r\nwrath, nor is it a creditable spectacle when one beholds the chief\r\nof a government giving private lessons in lying.\r\n\r\nA copy of the Gazette was sent to the Spanish Consul in Hongkong, also\r\na cablegram directing him to give it publicity that \"Spain's good name\r\nmight not suffer\" in that colony. By his blunder, not knowing that\r\nthe Lusitania Club was really a Portuguese Masonic lodge and full of\r\nRizal's friends, a copy was sent there and a strong reply was called\r\nforth. The friendly editor of the Hongkong Telegraph devoted columns to\r\nthe outrage by which a man whose acquaintance in the scientific world\r\nreflected honor upon his nation, was decoyed to what was intended\r\nto be his death, exiled to \"an unhealthful, savage spot,\" through\r\n\"a plot of which the very Borgias would have been ashamed.\"\r\n\r\nThe British Consul in Manila, too, mentioned unofficially to\r\nGovernor-General Despujol that it seemed a strange way of showing\r\nSpain's often professed friendship for Great Britain thus to disregard\r\nthe annoyance to the British colony of North Borneo caused by making\r\nimpossible an entirely unexceptionable plan. Likewise, in much the\r\nsame respectfully remonstrant tone which the Great Powers are wont\r\nto use in recalling to semi-savage states their obligations to\r\ncivilization, he pointed out how Spain's prestige as an advanced\r\nnation would suffer when the educated world, in which Rizal was\r\nSpain's best-known representative, learned that the man whom they\r\nhonored had been trapped out of his security under the British flag\r\nand sent into exile without the slightest form of trial.\r\n\r\nAlmost the last act of Rizal while at liberty was the establishment\r\nof the \"Liga Filipina,\" a league or association seeking to unite all\r\nFilipinos of good character for concerted action toward the economic\r\nadvancement of their country, for a higher standard of manhood, and\r\nto assure opportunities for education and development to talented\r\nFilipino youth. Resistance to oppression by lawful means was also\r\nurged, for Rizal believed that no one could fairly complain of bad\r\ngovernment until he had exhausted and found unavailing all the legal\r\nresources provided for his protection. This was another expression\r\nof his constant teaching that slaves, those who toadied to power,\r\nand men without self-respect made possible and fostered tyranny,\r\nabuses and disregard of the rights of others.\r\n\r\nThe character test was also a step forward, for the profession of\r\npatriotism has often been made to cloak moral shortcomings in the\r\nPhilippines as well as elsewhere. Rizal urged that those who would\r\noffer themselves on the altar of their fatherland must conform to\r\nthe standard of old, and, like the sacrificial lamb, be spotless\r\nand without blemish. Therefore, no one who had justifiably been\r\nprosecuted for any infamous crime was eligible to membership in the\r\nnew organization.\r\n\r\nThe plan, suggested by a Spanish Masonic society called C. Kadosch\r\ny Cia., originated with Jose Maria Basa, at whose instance Rizal\r\ndrafted the constitution and regulations. Possibly all the members\r\nwere Freemasons of the educated and better-to-do class, and most\r\nof them adhered to the doctrine that peaceably obtained reforms and\r\nprogress by education are surest and best.\r\n\r\nRizal's arrest discouraged those of this higher faith, for the\r\npeaceable policy seemed hopeless, while the radical element, freed from\r\nRizal's restraining influence and deeming the time for action come,\r\nformed a new and revolutionary society which preached force of arms\r\nas the only argument left to them, and sought its membership among\r\nthe less-enlightened and poorer class.\r\n\r\nTheir inspiration was Andres Bonifacio, a shipping clerk for a foreign\r\nfirm, who had read and re-read accounts of the French Revolution\r\ntill he had come to believe that blood alone could wipe out the\r\nwrongs of a country. His organization, The Sons of the Country,\r\nmore commonly called the Katipunan, was, however, far from being as\r\nbloodthirsty as most Spanish accounts, and those of many credulous\r\nwriters who have got their ideas from them, have asserted. To enlist\r\nothers in their defense, those who knew that they were the cause of\r\ndissatisfaction spread the report that a race war was in progress\r\nand that the Katipuneros were planning the massacre of all of the\r\nwhite race. It was a sufficiently absurd statement, but it was made\r\neven more ridiculous by its \"proof,\" for this was the discovery of an\r\napron with a severed head, a hand holding it by the hair and another\r\ngrasping the dagger which had done the bloody work. This emblem,\r\nhanded down from ancient days as an object lesson of faithfulness\r\neven to death, has been known in many lands besides the Philippines,\r\nbut only here has it ever been considered anything but an ancient\r\nsymbol. As reasonably might the paintings of martyrdoms in the\r\nconvents be taken as evidence of evil intentions upon the part of\r\ntheir occupants, but prejudice looks for pretexts rather than reasons,\r\nand this served as well as any other for the excesses of which the\r\ngovernment in its frenzy of fear was later guilty.\r\n\r\nIn talking of the Katipunan one must distinguish the first society,\r\nlimited in its membership, from the organization of the days of the\r\nAguinaldo \"republic,\" so called, when throughout the Tagalog provinces,\r\nand in the chief towns of other provinces as well, adherence to the\r\nrevolutionary government entailed membership in the revolutionary\r\nsociety. And neither of these two Katipunans bore any relation, except\r\nin name and emblems, to the robber bands whose valor was displayed\r\nafter the war had ceased and whose patriotism consisted in wronging\r\nand robbing their own defenseless countrymen and countrywomen, while\r\ncarefully avoiding encounters with any able to defend themselves.\r\n\r\nRizal's arrest had put an end to all hope of progress under\r\nGovernor-General Despujol. It had left the political field in\r\npossession of those countrymen who had not been in sympathy with\r\nhis campaign of education. It had caused the succession of the\r\nrevolutionary Katipunan to the economic Liga Filipina, with talk\r\nof independence supplanting Rizal's ambition for the return of\r\nthe Philippines to their former status under the Constitution of\r\nCadiz. But the victim of the arrest was at peace as he had not been\r\nin years. The sacrifice for country and for family had been made,\r\nbut it was not to cost him life, and he was human enough to wish to\r\nlive. A visitor's room in the Fort and books from the military library\r\nmade his detention comfortable, for he did not worry about the Spanish\r\nsentries without his door who were placed there under orders to shoot\r\nanyone who might attempt to signal to him from the plaza.\r\n\r\nOne night the Governor-General's nephew-aide came again to the Fort\r\nand Rizal embarked on the steamer which was to take him to his place\r\nof exile, but closely as he was guarded he risked dropping a note\r\nwhich a Filipino found and took, as it directed, to Mrs. Rizal's\r\ncousin, Vicenta Leyba, who lived in Calle Jose, Trozo. Thus the\r\nfamily were advised of his departure; this incident shows Rizal's\r\nperfect confidence in his countrymen and the extent to which it was\r\njustified; he could risk a chance finder to take so dangerous a letter\r\nto its address.\r\n\r\nOn the steamer he occupied an officer's cabin and also found a Filipino\r\nquartermaster, of whom he requested a life preserver for his stateroom;\r\nevidently he was not entirely confident that there were no hostile\r\ndesigns against him. Accidents had rid the Philippines of troublesome\r\npersons before his time, and he was determined that if he sacrificed\r\nhis life for his country, it should be openly. He realized that the\r\ntree of Liberty is often watered with the blood of secret as well as\r\nopen martyrs.\r\n\r\nThe same boat carried some soldier prisoners, one of whom was to be\r\nexecuted in Mindanao, and their case was not particularly creditable\r\nto Spanish ideas of justice. A Spanish officer had dishonorably\r\ninterfered with the domestic relations of a sergeant, also Spanish,\r\nand the aggrieved party had inflicted punishment upon his superior,\r\nwith the help of some other soldiers. For allowing himself to be\r\npunished, not for his own disgraceful act, the officer was dismissed\r\nfrom the service, but the sergeant was to go to the scene of his\r\nalleged \"crime,\" there to suffer death, while his companions who had\r\nassisted him in protecting their homes were to be witnesses of this\r\n\"justice\" and then to be imprisoned.\r\n\r\nAfter an uneventful trip the steamer reached Dapitan, in the northeast\r\nof the large island of Mindanao, on a dark and rainy evening. The\r\nofficer in charge of the expedition took Doctor Rizal ashore with\r\nsome papers relating to him and delivered all to the commandant,\r\nRicardo Carnicero. The receipt taken was briefed \"One countryman and\r\ntwo packages.\" At the same time learned men in Europe were beginning\r\nto hear of this outrage worthy of the Dark Ages and were remarking\r\nthat Spain had stopped the work of the man who was practically her\r\nonly representative in modern science, for the Castilian language\r\nhas not been the medium through which any considerable additions have\r\nbeen made to the world's store of scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nRizal was to reside either with the commandant or with the Jesuit\r\nparish priest, if the latter would take him into the convento. But\r\nwhile the exile had learned with pleasure that he was to meet priests\r\nwho were refined and learned, as well as associated with his happier\r\nschool days, he did not know that these priests were planning to\r\nrestore him to his childhood faith and had mapped out a plan of action\r\nwhich should first make him feel his loneliness. So he was denied\r\nresidence with the priest unless he would declare himself genuinely\r\nin sympathy with Spain.\r\n\r\nOn his previous brief visit to the Islands he had been repelled from\r\nthe Ateneo with the statement that till he ceased to be anti-Catholic\r\nand anti-Spanish he would not be welcome. Padre Faura, the famous\r\nmeteorologist, was his former instructor and Rizal was his favorite\r\npupil; he had tearfully predicted that the young man would come to\r\nthe scaffold at last unless he mended his ways. But Rizal, confident\r\nin the clearness of his own conscience, went out cheerfully, and when\r\nthe porter tried to bring back the memory of his childhood piety by\r\nreminding him of the image of the Sacred Heart which he had carved\r\nyears before, Rizal answered, \"Other times, other customs, Brother. I\r\ndo not believe that way any more.\"\r\n\r\nSo Rizal, a good Catholic, was compelled to board with the commandant\r\ninstead of with the priest because he was unwilling to make\r\nhypocritical professions of admiration for Spain. The commandant and\r\nRizal soon became good friends, but in order to retain his position\r\nCarnicero had to write to the Governor-General in a different strain.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence tells the facts in the main, but of course\r\nthey are colored throughout to conform to Despujol's character. The\r\ncommandant is always represented as deceiving his prisoner and gaining\r\nhis confidence only to betray him, but Rizal seems never to have\r\nexperienced anything but straightforward dealing.\r\n\r\nRizal's earliest letter from Dapitan speaks almost enthusiastically\r\nof the place, describing the climate as exceptional for the tropics,\r\nhis situation as agreeable, and saying that he could be quite content\r\nif his family and his books were there.\r\n\r\nShortly after occurred the anniversary of Carnicero's arrival in the\r\ntown, and Rizal celebrated the event with a Spanish poem reciting\r\nthe improvements made since his coming, written in the style of the\r\nMalay loa, and as though it were by the children of Dapitan.\r\n\r\nNext Rizal acquired a piece of property at Talisay, a little bay close\r\nto Dapitan, and at once became interested in his farm. Soon he built\r\na house and moved into it, gathering a number of boy assistants about\r\nhim, and before long he had a school. A hospital also was put up for\r\nhis patients and these in time became a source of revenue, as people\r\nfrom a distance came to the oculist for treatment and paid liberally.\r\n\r\nOne five-hundred-peso fee from a rich Englishman was devoted by Rizal\r\nto lighting the town, and the community benefited in this way by his\r\ncharity in addition to the free treatment given its poor.\r\n\r\nThe little settlement at Talisay kept growing and those who lived\r\nthere were constantly improving it. When Father Obach, the Jesuit\r\npriest, fell through the bamboo stairway in the principal house, Rizal\r\nand his boys burned shells, made mortar, and soon built a fine stone\r\nstairway. They also did another piece of masonry work in the shape of\r\na dam for storing water that was piped to the houses and poultry yard;\r\nthe overflow from the dam was made to fill a swimming tank.\r\n\r\nThe school, including the house servants, numbered about twenty and\r\nwas taught without books by Rizal, who conducted his recitations\r\nfrom a hammock. Considerable importance was given to mathematics,\r\nand in languages English was taught as well as Spanish, the entire\r\nwaking period being devoted to the language allotted for the day,\r\nand whoever so far forgot as to utter a word in any other tongue was\r\npunished by having to wear a rattan handcuff. The use and meaning of\r\nthis modern police device had to be explained to the boys, for Spain\r\nstill tied her prisoners with rope.\r\n\r\nNature study consisted in helping the Doctor gather specimens\r\nof flowers, shells, insects and reptiles which were prepared and\r\nshipped to German museums. Rizal was paid for these specimens by\r\nscientific books and material. The director of the Royal Zooelogical\r\nand Anthropological Museum in Dresden, Saxony, Doctor Karl von Heller,\r\nwas a great friend and admirer of Doctor Rizal. Doctor Heller's father\r\nwas tutor to the late King Alfonso XII and had many friends at the\r\nCourt of Spain. Evidently Doctor Heller and other of his European\r\nfriends did not consider Rizal a Spanish insurrectionary, but treated\r\nhim rather as a reformer seeking progress by peaceful means.\r\n\r\nDoctor Rizal remunerated his pupils' work with gifts of clothing,\r\nbooks and other useful remembrances. Sometimes the rewards were\r\ncartidges, and those who had accumulated enough were permitted to\r\naccompany him in his hunting expeditions. The dignity of labor was\r\npractically inculcated by requiring everyone to make himself useful,\r\nand this was really the first school of the type, combining the use\r\nof English, nature study and industrial instruction.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion in the year 1894 some of his schoolboys secretly\r\nwent into the town in a banca; a puppy which tried to follow them\r\nwas eaten by a crocodile. Rizal tired to impress the evil effects of\r\ndisobedience upon the youngsters by pointing out to them the sorrow\r\nwhich the mother-dog felt at the loss of her young one, and emphasized\r\nthe lesson by modeling a statuette called \"The Mother's Revenge,\"\r\nwherein she is represented, in revenge, as devouring the cayman. It\r\nis said to be a good likeness of the animal which was Doctor Rizal's\r\nfavorite companion in his many pedestrian excursions around Dapitan.\r\n\r\nFather Francisco Sanchez, Rizal's instructor in rhetoric in the Ateneo,\r\nmade a long visit to Dapitan and brought with him some surveyor's\r\ninstruments, which his former pupil was delighted to assist him in\r\nusing. Together they ran the levels for a water system for the the\r\ntown, which was later, with the aid of the lay Jesuit, Brother Tildot,\r\ncarried to completion. This same water system is now being restored\r\nand enlarged with artesian wells by the present insular, provincial\r\nand municipal governments jointly, as part of the memorial to Rizal\r\nin this place of his exile.\r\n\r\nA visit to a not distant mountain and some digging in a spot supposed\r\nby the people of the region to be haunted brought to light curious\r\nrelics of the first Christian converts among the early Moros.\r\n\r\nThe state of his mind at about this period of his career is indicated\r\nby the verses written in his home in Talisay, entitled \"My Retreat,\"\r\nof which the following translation has been made by Mr. Charles\r\nDerbyshire. The scene that inspired this poem has been converted by\r\nthe government into a public park to the memory of Rizal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  My Retreat\r\n\r\n  By the spreading beach where the sands are soft and fine,\r\n  At the foot of the mount in its mantle of green,\r\n  I have built my hut in the pleasant grove's confine;\r\n  From the forest seeking peace and a calmness divine,\r\n  Rest for the weary brain and silence to my sorrow keen.\r\n\r\n  Its roof the frail palm-leaf and its floor the cane,\r\n  Its beams and posts of the unhewn wood;\r\n  Little there is of value in this hut so plain,\r\n  And better by far in the lap of the mount to have lain,\r\n  By the song and the murmur of the high sea's flood.\r\n\r\n  A purling brook from the woodland glade\r\n  Drops down o'er the stones and around it sweeps,\r\n  Whence a fresh stream is drawn by the rough cane's aid;\r\n  That in the still night its murmur has made,\r\n  And in the day's heat a crystal fountain leaps.\r\n\r\n  When the sky is serene how gently it flows,\r\n  And its zither unseen ceaselessly plays;\r\n  But when the rains fall a torrent it goes\r\n  Boiling and foaming through the rocky close,\r\n  Roaring uncheck'd to the sea's wide ways.\r\n\r\n  The howl of the dog and the song of the bird,\r\n  And only the kalao's hoarse call resound;\r\n  Nor is the voice of vain man to be heard,\r\n  My mind to harass or my steps to begird;\r\n  The woodlands alone and the sea wrap me round.\r\n\r\n  The sea, ah, the sea! for me it is all,\r\n  As it massively sweeps from the worlds apart;\r\n  Its smile in the morn to my soul is a call,\r\n  And when in the even my fath seems to pall,\r\n  It breathes with its sadness an echo to my heart.\r\n\r\n  By night an arcanum; when translucent it glows,\r\n  All spangled over with its millions of lights,\r\n  And the bright sky above resplendent shows;\r\n  While the waves with their sighs tell of their woes--\r\n  Tales that are lost as they roll to the heights.\r\n\r\n  They tell of the world when the first dawn broke,\r\n  And the sunlight over their surface played;\r\n  When thousands of beings from nothingness woke,\r\n  To people the depths and the heights to cloak,\r\n  Wherever its life-giving kiss was laid.\r\n\r\n  But when in the night the wild winds awake,\r\n  And the waves in their fury begin to leap,\r\n  Through the air rush the cries that my mind shake;\r\n  Voices that pray, songs and moans that partake\r\n  Of laments from the souls sunk down in the deep.\r\n\r\n  Then from their heights the mountains groan,\r\n  And the trees shiver tremulous from great unto least;\r\n  The groves rustle plaintive and the herds utter moan,\r\n  For they say that the ghosts of the folk that are gone\r\n  Are calling them down to their death's merry feast.\r\n\r\n  In terror and confusion whispers the night,\r\n  While blue and green flames flit over the deep;\r\n  But calm reigns again with the morning's light,\r\n  And soon the bold fisherman comes into sight,\r\n  As his bark rushes on and the waves sink to sleep.\r\n\r\n  So onward glide the days in my lonely abode;\r\n  Driven forth from the world where once I was known,\r\n  I muse o'er the fate upon me bestow'd;\r\n  A fragment forgotten that the moss will corrode,\r\n  To hide from mankind the world in me shown.\r\n\r\n  I live in the thought of the lov'd ones left,\r\n  And oft their names to my mind are borne;\r\n  Some have forsaken me and some by death are reft;\r\n  But now 'tis all one, as through the past I drift,\r\n  That past which from me can never be torn.\r\n\r\n  For it is the friend that is with me always,\r\n  That ever in sorrow keeps the faith in my soul;\r\n  While through the still night it watches and prays,\r\n  As here in my exile in my lone hut it stays,\r\n  To strengthen my faith when doubts o'er me roll.\r\n\r\n  That faith I keep and I hope to see shine\r\n  The day when the Idea prevails over might;\r\n  When after the fray and death's slow decline,\r\n  Some other voice sounds, far happier than mine,\r\n  To raise the glad song of the triumph of right.\r\n\r\n  I see the sky glow, refulgent and clear,\r\n  As when it forced on me my first dear illusion;\r\n  I feel the same wind kiss my forehead sere,\r\n  And the fire is the same that is burning here\r\n  To stir up youth's blood in boiling confusion.\r\n\r\n  I breathe here the winds that perchance have pass'd\r\n  O'er the fields and the rivers of my own natal shore;\r\n  And mayhap they will bring on the returning blast\r\n  The sighs that lov'd being upon them has cast--\r\n  Messages sweet from the love I first bore.\r\n\r\n  To see the same moon, all silver'd as of yore,\r\n  I feel the sad thoughts within me arise;\r\n  The fond recollections of the troth we swore,\r\n  Of the field and the bower and the wide seashore,\r\n  The blushes of joy, with the silence and sighs.\r\n\r\n  A butterfly seeking the flowers and the light,\r\n  Of other lands dreaming, of vaster extent;\r\n  Scarce a youth, from home and love I took flight,\r\n  To wander unheeding, free from doubt or affright--\r\n  So in foreign lands were my brightest days spent.\r\n\r\n  And when like a languishing bird I was fain\r\n  To the home of my fathers and my love to return,\r\n  Of a sudden the fierce tempest roar'd amain;\r\n  So I saw my wings shatter'd and no home remain,\r\n  My trust sold to others and wrecks round me burn.\r\n\r\n  Hurl'd out into exile from the land I adore,\r\n  My future all dark and no refuge to seek;\r\n  My roseate dreams hover round me once more,\r\n  Sole treasures of all that life to me bore;\r\n  The faiths of youth that with sincerity speak.\r\n\r\n  But not as of old, full of life and of grace,\r\n  Do you hold out hopes of undying reward;\r\n  Sadder I find you; on your lov'd face,\r\n  Though still sincere, the pale lines trace\r\n  The marks of the faith it is yours to guard.\r\n\r\n  You offer now, dreams, my gloom to appease,\r\n  And the years of my youth again to disclose;\r\n  So I thank you, O storm, and heaven-born breeze,\r\n  That you knew of the hour my wild flight to ease,\r\n  To cast me back down to the soil whence I rose.\r\n\r\n  By the spreading beach where the sands are soft and fine,\r\n  At the foot of the mount in its mantle of green;\r\n  I have found a home in the pleasant grove's confine,\r\n  In the shady woods, that peace and calmness divine,\r\n  Rest for the weary brain and silence to my sorrow keen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church benefited by the presence of the exile, for he drew the\r\ndesign for an elaborate curtain to adorn the sanctuary at Easter\r\ntime, and an artist Sister of Charity of the school there did the\r\noil painting under his direction. In this line he must have been\r\nproficient, for once in Spain, where he traveled out of his way to\r\nSaragossa to visit one of his former teachers of the Ateneo, who\r\nhe had heard was there, Rizal offered his assistance in making some\r\naltar paintings, and the Jesuit says that his skill and taste were\r\nmuch appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe home of the Sisters had a private chapel, for which the teachers\r\nwere preparing an image of the Virgin. For the sake of economy the\r\nhead only was procured from abroad, the vestments concealing all\r\nthe rest of the figure except the feet, which rested upon a globe\r\nencircled by a snake in whose mouth is an apple. The beauty of the\r\ncountenance, a real work of art, appealed to Rizal, and he modeled\r\nthe more prominent right foot, the apple and the serpent's head, while\r\nthe artist Sister assisted by doing the minor work. Both curtain and\r\nimage, twenty years after their making, are still in use.\r\n\r\nOn Sundays, Father Sanchez and Rizal conducted a school for the people\r\nafter mass. As part of this education it was intended to make raised\r\nmaps in the plaza of the chief city of the eight principal islands of\r\nthe Philippines, but on account of Father Sanchez's being called away,\r\nonly one. Mindanao, was completed; it has been restored with a concrete\r\nsidewalk and balustrade about it, while the plaza is a national park.\r\n\r\nAmong Rizal's patients was a blind American named Taufer, fairly well\r\nto do, who had been engineer of the pumping plant of the Hongkong Fire\r\nDepartment. He was a man of bravery, for he held a diploma for helping\r\nto rescue five Spaniards from a shipwreck in Hongkong harbor. And he\r\nwas not less kind-hearted, for he and his wife, a Portuguese, had\r\nadopted and brought up as their own the infant daughter of a poor\r\nIrish woman who had died in Hongkong, leaving a considerable family\r\nto her husband, a corporal in the British Army on service there.\r\n\r\nThe little girl had been educated in the Italian convent after the\r\nfirst Mrs. Taufer died, and upon Mr. Taufer's remarriage, to another\r\nPortuguese, the adopted daughter and Mr. Taufer's own child were\r\nequally sharers of his home.\r\n\r\nThis girl had known Rizal, \"the Spanish doctor,\" as he was called\r\nthere, in Hongkong, and persuaded her adopted father that possibly\r\nthe Dapitan exile might restore his lost eyesight. So with the two\r\ngirls and his wife, Mr. Taufer set out for Mindanao. At Manila his\r\nown daughter fell in love with a Filipino engineer, a Mr. Sunico,\r\nnow owner of a foundry in Manila, and, marrying, remained there. But\r\nthe party reached Dapitan with its original number, for they were\r\njoined by a good-looking mestiza from the South who was unofficially\r\nconnected with one of the canons of the Manila cathedral.\r\n\r\nJosefina Bracken, the Irish girl, was lively, capable and of congenial\r\ntemperament, and as there no longer existed any reason against his\r\nmarriage, for Rizal considered his political days over, they agreed\r\nto become husband and wife.\r\n\r\nThe priest was asked to perform the ceremony, but said the Bishop\r\nof Cebu must give his consent, and offered to write him. Rizal at\r\nfirst feared that some political retraction would be asked, but\r\nwhen assured that only his religious beliefs would be investigated,\r\npromptly submitted a statement which Father Obach says covered about\r\nthe same ground as the earliest published of the retractions said to\r\nhave been made on the eve of Rizal's death.\r\n\r\nThis document, inclosed with the priest's letter, was ready for the\r\nmail when Rizal came hurrying in to reclaim it. The marriage was off,\r\nfor Mr. Taufer had taken his family and gone to Manila.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this sudden departure was that, after the blind\r\nman had been told of the impossibility of anything being done for his\r\neyes, he was informed of the proposed marriage. The trip had already\r\ncost him one daughter, he had found that his blindness was incurable,\r\nand now his only remaining daughter, who had for seventeen years\r\nbeen like his own child, was planning to leave him. He would have to\r\nreturn to Hongkong hopeless and accompanied only by a wife he had\r\nnever seen, one who really was merely a servant. In his despair he\r\nsaid he had nothing to live for, and, seizing his razor, would have\r\nended his life had not Rizal seized him just in time and held him,\r\nwith the firm grasp his athletic training had given him, till the\r\ncommandant came and calmed the excited blind man.\r\n\r\nIt resulted in Josefina returning to Manila with him, but after a\r\nwhile Mr Taufer listened to reason and she went back to Dapitan,\r\nafter a short stay in Manila with Rizal's family, to whom she had\r\ncarried his letter of introduction, taking considerable housekeeping\r\nfurniture with her.\r\n\r\nFurther consideration changed Rizal's opinion as to marriage, possibly\r\nbecause the second time the priest may not have been so liberal in his\r\nrequirements. The mother, too, seems to have suggested that as Spanish\r\nlaw had established civil marriage in the Philippines, and as the local\r\ngovernment had not provided any way for people to avail themselves of\r\nthe right, because the governor-general had pigeon-holed the royal\r\ndecree, it would be less sinful for the two to consider themselves\r\ncivilly married than for Rizal to do violence to his conscience\r\nby making any sort of political retraction. Any marriage so bought\r\nwould be just as little a sacrament as an absolutely civil marriage,\r\nand the latter was free from hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nSo as man and wife Rizal and Josefina lived together in Talisay. Father\r\nObach sought to prejudice public feeling in the town against the\r\nexile for the \"scandal,\" though other scandals happenings with less\r\nreason were going on unrebuked. The pages of \"Dapitan\", which some\r\nhave considered to be the first chapter of an unfinished novel, may\r\nreasonably be considered no more than Rizal's rejoinder to Father\r\nObach, written in sarcastic vein and primarily for Carnicero's\r\namusement, unless some date of writing earlier than this should\r\nhereafter be found for them.\r\n\r\nJosefina was bright, vivacious, and a welcome addition to the little\r\ncolony at Talisay, but at times Rizal had misgivings as to how it came\r\nthat this foreigner should be permitted by a suspicious and absolute\r\ngovernment to join him, when Filipinos, over whom the authorities\r\ncould have exercised complete control, were kept away. Josefina's\r\nfrequent visits to the convento once brought this suspicion to an open\r\ndeclaration of his misgivings by Rizal, but two days of weeping upon\r\nher part caused him to avoid the subiect thereafter. Could the exile\r\nhave seen the confidential correspondence in the secret archives\r\nthe plan would have been plain to him, for there it is suggested\r\nthat his impressionable character could best be reached through the\r\nsufferings of his family, and that only his mother and sisters should\r\nbe allowed to visit him. Steps in this plot were the gradual pardoning\r\nand returning of the members of his family to their homes.\r\n\r\nJosefina must remain a mystery to us as she was to Rizal. While she\r\nwas in a delicate condition Rizal played a prank on her, harmless\r\nin itself, which startled her so that she sprang forward and struck\r\nagainst an iron stand. Though it was pure accident and Rizal was\r\nscarcely at fault, he blamed himself for it, and his later devotion\r\nseems largely to have been trying to make amends.\r\n\r\nThe \"burial of the son of Rizal,\" sometimes referred to as occurring at\r\nDapitan, has for its foundation the consequences of this accident. A\r\nsketch hastily penciled in one of his medical books depicts an\r\nunusual condition apparent in the infant which, had it regularly\r\nmade its appearance in the world some months later, would have been\r\ncherished by both parents; this loss was a great and common grief\r\nwhich banished thereafter all distrust upon his part and all occasion\r\nfor it upon hers.\r\n\r\nRizal's mother and several of his sisters, the latter changing from\r\ntime to time, had been present during this critical period. Another\r\noperation had been performed upon Mrs. Rizal's eyes, but she was\r\nrestive and disregarded the ordinary precautions, and the son was\r\nin despair. A letter to his brother-in-law, Manuel Hidalgo, who was\r\ninclined toward medical studies, says, \"I now realize the reason why\r\nphysicians are directed not to practice in their own families.\"\r\n\r\nA story of his mother and Rizal, necessary to understand his\r\npeculiar attitude toward her, may serve as the transition from\r\nthe hero's sad (later) married experience to the real romance of\r\nhis life. Mrs. Rizal's talents commanded her son's admiration, as\r\nher care for him demanded his gratitude, but, despite the common\r\nopinion, he never had that sense of companionship with her that he\r\nenjoyed with his father. Mrs. Rizal was a strict disciplinarian and\r\na woman of unexceptionable character, but she arrogated to herself\r\nan infallibility which at times was trying to those about her, and\r\nshe foretold bitter fates for those who dared dispute her.\r\n\r\nJust before Jose went abroad to study, while engaged to his cousin,\r\nLeonora Rivera, Mrs. Rivera and her daughter visited their relatives in\r\nKalamba. Naturally the young man wished the guests to have the best of\r\neverything; one day when they visited a bathing place near by he used\r\nthe family's newest carriage. Though this had not been forbidden,\r\nhis mother spoke rather sharply about it; Jose ventured to remind\r\nher that guests were present and that it would be better to discuss\r\nthe matter in private. Angry because one of her children ventured to\r\ndispute her, she replied: \"You are an undutiful son. You will never\r\naccomplish anything which you undertake. All your plans will result\r\nin failure.\" These words could not be forgotten, as succeeding events\r\nseemed to make their prophecy come true, and there is pathos in one of\r\nRizal's letters in which he reminds his mother that she had foretold\r\nhis fate.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts of an early marriage were overruled because his unmarried\r\nsisters did not desire to have a sister-in-law in their home who\r\nwould add to the household cares but was not trained to bear her\r\nshare of them, and even Paciano, who was in his favor, thought that\r\nhis younger brother would mar his career by marrying early.\r\n\r\nSo, with fervent promises and high hopes, Rizal had sailed away to make\r\nthe fortune which should allow him to marry his cousin Leonora. She\r\nwas constantly in his thoughts and his long letters were mailed with\r\nregular frequency during all his first years in Europe; but only a\r\nfew of the earliest ever reached her, and as few replies came into\r\nhis hands, though she was equally faithful as a correspondent.\r\n\r\nLeonora's mother had been told that it was for the good of her\r\ndaughter's soul and in the interest of her happiness that she should\r\nnot become the wife of a man like Rizal, who was obnoxious to the\r\nChurch and in disfavor with the government. So, by advice, Mrs. Rivera\r\ngradually withheld more and more of the correspondence upon both sides,\r\nuntil finally it ceased. And she constantly suggested to the unhappy\r\ngirl that her youthful lover had forgotten her amid the distractions\r\nand gayeties of Europe.\r\n\r\nThen the same influence which had advised breaking off the\r\ncorrespondence found a person whom the mother and others joined in\r\nurging upon her as a husband, till at last, in the belief that she\r\nowed obedience to her mother, she reluctantly consented. Strangely\r\nlike the proposed husband of the Maria Clara of \"Noli Me Tangere,\"\r\nin which book Rizal had prophetically pictured her, this husband was\r\n\"one whose children should rule \"--an English engineer whose position\r\nhad been found for him to make the match more desirable. Their marriage\r\ntook place, and when Rizal returned to the Philippines she learned\r\nhow she had been deceived. Then she asked for the letters that had\r\nbeen withheld, and when told that as a wife she might not keep love\r\nletters from any but her husband, she pleaded that they be burned\r\nand the ashes given her. This was done, and the silver box with the\r\nblackened bits of paper upon her dresser seemed to be a consolation\r\nduring the few months of life which she knew would remain to her.\r\n\r\nAnother great disappointment to Rizal was the action of Despujol\r\nwhen he first arrived in Dapitan, for he still believed in the\r\nGovernor-General's good faith and thought in that fertile but sparsely\r\nsettled region he might plant his \"New Kalamba\" without the objection\r\nthat had been urged against the British North Borneo project. All\r\nseemed to be going on favorably for the assembling of his relatives and\r\nneighbors in what then would be no longer exile, when most insultingly,\r\nthe Governor-General refused the permission which Rizal had had reason\r\nto rely upon his granting. The exile was reminded of his deportation\r\nand taunted with trying to make himself a king. Though he did not know\r\nit, this was part of the plan which was to break his spirit, so that\r\nwhen he was touched with the sufferings of his family he would yield\r\nto the influences of his youth and make complete political retraction;\r\nthus would be removed the most reasonable, and therefore the most\r\nformidable, opponent of the unnatural conditions Philippines and of\r\nthe selfish interests which were profiting by them. But the plotters\r\nfailed in their plan; they had mistaken their man.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Rizal had repeated chances to escape, and persons\r\nhigh in authority seem to have urged flight upon him. Running away,\r\nhowever, seemed to him a confession of guilt; the opportunities\r\nof doing so always unsettled him, for each time the battle of\r\nself-sacrifice had to be fought over again; but he remained firm\r\nin his purpose. To meet death bravely is one thing; to seek it is\r\nanother and harder thing; but to refuse life and choose death over\r\nand over again during many years is the rarest kind of heroism.\r\n\r\nRizal used to make long trips, sometimes cruising for a week in his\r\nexplorations of the Mindanao coast, and some of his friends proposed\r\nto charter a steamer in Singapore and, passing near Dapitan, pick him\r\nup on one of these trips. Another Philippine steamer going to Borneo\r\nsuggested taking him on board as a rescue at sea and then landing him\r\nat their destination, where he would be free from Spanish power. Either\r\nof these schemes would have been feasible, but he refused both.\r\n\r\nPlans, which materialized, to benefit the fishing industry by improved\r\nnets imported from his Laguna home, and to find a market for the abaka\r\nof Dapitan, were joined with the introduction of American machinery,\r\nfor which Rizal acted as agent, among planters of neighboring\r\nislands. It was a busy, useful life, and in the economic advancement\r\nof his country the exile believed he was as patriotic as when he was\r\nworking politically.\r\n\r\nRizal personally had been fortunate, for in company with the commandant\r\nand a Spaniard, originally deported for political reasons from the\r\nPeninsula, he had gained one of the richer prizes in the government\r\nlottery. These funds came most opportunely, for the land troubles\r\nand succeeding litigation had almost stripped the family of all its\r\npossessions. The account of the first news in Dapitan of the good\r\nfortune of the three is interestingly told in an official report to the\r\nGovernor-General from the commandant. The official saw the infrequent\r\nmail steamer arriving with flying bunting and at once imagined some\r\nhigh authority was aboard; he hastened to the beach with a band of\r\nmusic to assist in the welcome, but was agreeably disappointed with\r\nthe news of the luck which had befallen his prisoner and himself.\r\n\r\nNot all of Dapitan life was profitable and prosperous. Yet in spite\r\nof this Rizal stayed in the town. This was pure self-sacrifice,\r\nfor he refused to make any effort for his own release by invoking\r\ninfluences which could have brought pressure to bear upon the\r\nSpanish home government. He feared to act lest obstacles might be\r\nput in the way of the reforms that were apparently making headway\r\nthrough Despujol's initiative, and was content to wait rather than\r\nto jeopardize the prospects of others.\r\n\r\nA plan for his transfer to the North, in the Ilokano country, had been\r\ndeferred and had met with obstacles which Rizal believed were placed in\r\nits way through some of his own countrymen in the Peninsula who feared\r\nhis influence upon the revenue with which politics was furnishing them.\r\n\r\nAnother proposal was to appoint Rizal district health officer for\r\nDapitan, but this was merely a covert government bribe. While the\r\nexile expressed his willingness to accept the position, he did not\r\nmake the \"unequivocally Spanish\" professions that were needed to\r\nsecure this appointment.\r\n\r\nYet the government could have been satisfied of Rizal's innocence of\r\nany treasonable designs against Spain's sovereignty in the Islands\r\nhad it known how the exile had declined an opportunity to head the\r\nmovement which had been initiated on the eve of his deportation. His\r\nname had been used to gather the members together and his portrait\r\nhung in each Katipunan lodge hall, but all this was without Rizal's\r\nconsent or even his knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe members, who had been paying faithfully for four years, felt that\r\nit was time that something besides collecting money was done. Their\r\nrestiveness and suspicions led Andres Bonifacio, its head, to resort\r\nto Rizal, feeling that a word from the exile, who had religiously\r\nheld aloof from all politics since his deportation, would give the\r\nKatipunan leaders more time to mature their plans. So he sent a\r\nmessenger to Dapitan, Pio Valenzuela, a doctor, who to conceal his\r\nmission took with him a blind man. Thus the doctor and his patient\r\nappeared as on a professional visit to the exiled oculist. But though\r\nthe interview was successfully secured in this way, its results were\r\nfar from satisfactory.\r\n\r\nFar from feeling grateful for the consideration for the possible\r\nconsequences to him which Valenzuela pretended had prompted the\r\nvisit, Rizal indignantly insisted that the country came first. He\r\ncited the Spanish republics of South America, with their alternating\r\nrevolutions and despotisms, as a warning against embarking on a change\r\nof government for which the people were not prepared. Education, he\r\ndeclared, was first necessary, and in his opinion general enlightenment\r\nwas the only road to progress. Valenzuela cut short his trip, glad\r\nto escape without anyone realizing that Rizal and he had quarreled.\r\n\r\nBonifacio called Rizal a coward when he heard his emissary's report,\r\nand enjoined Valenzuela to say nothing of his trip. But the truth\r\nleaked out, and there was a falling away in Katipunan membership.\r\n\r\nDoctor Rizal's own statement respecting the rebellion and Valenzuela's\r\nvisit may fitly be quoted here:\r\n\r\n\"I had no notice at all of what was being planned until the first or\r\nsecond of July, in 1896, when Pio Valenzuela came to see me, saying\r\nthat an uprising was being arranged. I told him that it was absurd,\r\netc., etc., and he answered me that they could bear no more. I advised\r\nhim that they should have patience, etc., etc. He added then that\r\nhe had been sent because they had compassion on my life and that\r\nprobably it would compromise me. I replied that they should have\r\npatience and that if anything happened to me I would then prove my\r\ninnocence. 'Besides,' said I, 'don't consider me, but our country,\r\nwhich is the one that will suffer.' I went on to show how absurd was\r\nthe movement.--This, later, Pio Valenzuela testified.--He did not\r\ntell me that my name was being used, neither did he suggest that I\r\nwas its chief, or anything of that sort.\r\n\r\n\"Those who testify that I am the chief (which I do not know, nor do I\r\nknow of having ever treated with them), what proofs do they present of\r\nmy having accepted this chiefship or that I was in relations with them\r\nor with their society? Either they have made use of my name for their\r\nown purposes or they have been deceived by others who have. Where is\r\nthe chief who dictates no order and makes no arrangement, who is not\r\nconsulted in anything about so important an enterprise until the last\r\nmoment, and then when he decides against it is disobeyed? Since the\r\nseventh of July of 1892 I have entirely ceased political activity. It\r\nseems some have wished to avail themselves of my name for their\r\nown ends.\"\r\n\r\nThis was Rizal's second temptation to engage in politics, the first\r\nhaving been a trap laid by his enemies. A man had come to see Rizal\r\nin his earlier days in Dapitan, claiming to be a relative and seeking\r\nletters to prominent Filipinos. The deceit was too plain and Rizal\r\ndenounced the envoy to the commandant, whose investigations speedily\r\ndisclosed the source of the plot. Further prosecution, of course,\r\nceased at once.\r\n\r\nThe visit of some image vendors from Laguna who never before had\r\nvisited that region, and who seemed more intent on escaping notice\r\nthan interested in business, appeared suspicious, but upon report of\r\nthe Jesuits the matter was investigated and nothing really suspicious\r\nwas found.\r\n\r\nRizal's charm of manner and attraction for every one he met is best\r\nshown by his relations with the successive commandants at Dapitan,\r\nall of whom, except Carnicero, were naturally predisposed against him,\r\nbut every one became his friend and champion. One even asked relief on\r\nthe ground of this growing favorable impression upon his part toward\r\nhis prisoner.\r\n\r\nAt times there were rumors of Rizal's speedy pardon, and he would\r\nthink of going regularly into scientific work, collecting for those\r\nEuropean museums which had made him proposals that assured ample\r\nlivelihood and congenial work.\r\n\r\nThen Doctor Blumentritt wrote to him of the ravages of disease among\r\nthe Spanish soldiers in Cuba and the scarcity of surgeons to attend\r\nthem. Here was a labor \"eminently humanitarian,\" to quote Rizal's words\r\nof his own profession, and it made so strong an appeal to him that,\r\nthrough the new governor-general, for Despujol had been replaced by\r\nBlanco, he volunteered his services. The minister of war of that time,\r\nGeneral Azcarraga, was Philippine born. Blanco considered the time\r\nfavorable for granting Rizal's petition and thus lifting the decree of\r\ndeportation without the embarrassment of having the popular prisoner\r\nremain in the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe thought of resuming his travels evidently inspired the following\r\npoem, which was written at about this time. The translation is by\r\nArthur P. Ferguson:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Song of the Traveler\r\n\r\n  Like to a leaf that is fallen and withered,\r\n  Tossed by the tempest from pole unto pole;\r\n  Thus roams the pilgrim abroad without purpose,\r\n  Roams without love, without country or soul.\r\n\r\n  Following anxiously treacherous fortune,\r\n  Fortune which e'en as he grasps at it flees;\r\n  Vain though the hopes that his yearning is seeking,\r\n  Yet does the pilgrim embark on the seas!\r\n\r\n  Ever impelled by invisible power,\r\n  Destined to roam from the East to the West;\r\n  Oft he remembers the faces of loved ones,\r\n  Dreams of the day when he, too, was at rest.\r\n\r\n  Chance may assign him a tomb on the desert,\r\n  Grant him a final asylum of peace;\r\n  Soon by the world and his country forgotten,\r\n  God rest his soul when his wanderings cease!\r\n\r\n  Often the sorrowful pilgrim is envied,\r\n  Circling the globe like a sea-gull above;\r\n  Little, ah, little they know what a void\r\n  Saddens his soul by the absence of love.\r\n\r\n  Home may the pilgrim return in the future,\r\n  Back to his loved ones his footsteps he bends;\r\n  Naught will he find but the snow and the ruins,\r\n  Ashes of love and the tomb of his friends.\r\n\r\n  Pilgrim, begone! Nor return more hereafter.\r\n  Stranger thou art in the land of thy birth;\r\n  Others may sing of their love while rejoicing,\r\n  Thou once again must roam o'er the earth.\r\n\r\n  Pilgrim, begone! Nor return more hereafter,\r\n  Dry are the tears that a while for thee ran;\r\n  Pilgrim, begone! And forget thy affliction,\r\n  Loud laughs the world at the sorrows of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\"Consummatum Est\"\r\n\r\nNOTICE of the granting of his request came to Rizal just when\r\nrepeated disappointments had caused him to prepare for staying\r\nin Dapitan. Immediately he disposed of his salable possessions,\r\nincluding a Japanese tea set and large mirror now among the Rizal\r\nrelics preserved by the government, and a piece of outlying land,\r\nthe deed for which is also among the Rizalana in the Philippines\r\nlibrary. Some half-finished busts were thrown into the pool behind\r\nthe dam. Despite the short notice all was ready for the trip in time,\r\nand, attended by some of his schoolboys as well as by Josefina and\r\nRizal's niece, the daughter of his youngest sister, Soledad, whom\r\nJosefina wished to adopt, the party set out for Manila.\r\n\r\nThe journey was not an uneventful one; at Dumaguete Rizal was the\r\nguest of a Spanish judge at dinner; in Cebu he operated successfully\r\nupon the eyes of a foreign merchant; and in Iloilo the local newspaper\r\nmade much of his presence.\r\n\r\nThe steamer from Dapitan reached Manila a little too late for the mail\r\nboat for Spain, and Rizal obtained permission to await the next sailing\r\non board the cruiser Castilla, in the bay. Here he was treated like a\r\nguest and more than once the Spanish captain invited members of Rizal's\r\nfamily to be his guests at dinner--Josefina with little Maria Luisa,\r\nthe niece and the schoolboys, for whom positions had been obtained,\r\nin Manila.\r\n\r\nThe alleged uprising of the Katipunan occurred during this time. A\r\nTondo curate, with an eye to promotion, professed to have discovered\r\na gigantic conspiracy. Incited by him, the lower class of Spaniards\r\nin Manila made demonstrations against Blanco and tried to force\r\nthat ordinarily sensible and humane executive into bloodthirsty\r\nmeasures, which should terrorize the Filipinos. Blanco had known of\r\nthe Katipunan but realized that so long as interested parties were\r\nusing it as a source of revenue, its activities would not go much\r\nbeyond speechmaking. The rabble was not so far-seeing, and from high\r\nauthorities came advice that the country was in a fever and could\r\nonly be saved by blood-letting.\r\n\r\nWholesale arrests filled every possible place for prisoners in\r\nManila. The guilt of one suspect consisted in having visited the\r\nAmerican consul to secure the address of a New York medical journal,\r\nand other charges were just as frivolous. There was a reign of terror\r\nin Luzon and, to save themselves, members of the Katipunan resorted to\r\nthat open warfare which, had Blanco's prudent counsels been regarded,\r\nwould probably have been avoided.\r\n\r\nWhile the excitement was at its height, with a number of executions\r\nfailing to satisfy the blood-hunger, Rizal sailed for Spain,\r\nbearing letters of recommendation from Blanco. These vouched for his\r\nexemplary conduct during his exile and stated that he had in no way\r\nbeen implicated in the conspiracies then disturbing the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish mail boat upon which Rizal finally sailed had among its\r\npassengers a sick Jesuit, to whose care Rizal devoted himself, and\r\nthough most of the passengers were openly hostile to one whom they\r\nsupposed responsible for the existing outbreak, his professional\r\nskill led several to avail themselves of his services. These were\r\ngiven with a deference to the ship's doctor which made that official\r\nan admirer and champion of his colleague.\r\n\r\nThree only of the passengers, however, were really friendly--one\r\nJuan Utor y Fernandez, a prominent Mason and republican, another\r\nex-official in the Philippines who shared Utor's liberal views,\r\nand a young man whose father was republican.\r\n\r\nBut if Rizal's chief adversaries were content that he should go where\r\nhe would not molest them or longer jeopardize their interests, the\r\nrabble that had been excited by the hired newspaper advocates was\r\nnot so easily calmed. Every one who felt that his picture had been\r\npainted among the lower Spanish types portrayed in \"Noli Me Tangere\"\r\nwas loud for revenge. The clamor grew so great that it seemed possible\r\nto take advantage of it to displace General Blanco, who was not a\r\nconvenient tool for the interests.\r\n\r\nSo his promotion was bought, it is said, to get one Polavieja,\r\na willing tool, in his place. As soon as this scheme was arranged,\r\na cablegram ordering Rizal's arrest was sent; it overtook the steamer\r\nat Suez. Thus as a prisoner he completed his journey.\r\n\r\nBut this had not been entirely unforeseen, for when the steamer reached\r\nSingapore, Rizal's companion on board, the Filipino millionaire Pedro\r\nP. Roxas, had deserted the ship, urging the ex-exile to follow his\r\nexample. Rizal demurred, and said such flight would be considered\r\nconfession of guilt, but he was not fully satisfied in his mind that\r\nhe was safe. At each port of call his uncertainty as to what course\r\nto pursue manifested itself, for though he considered his duty to his\r\ncountry already done, and his life now his own, he would do nothing\r\nthat suggested an uneasy conscience despite his lack of confidence\r\nin Spanish justice.\r\n\r\nAt first, not knowing the course of events in Manila, he very naturally\r\nblamed Governor-General Blanco for bad faith, and spoke rather harshly\r\nof him in a letter to Doctor Blumentritt, an opinion which he changed\r\nlater when the truth was revealed to him in Manila.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of the steamer in Barcelona the prisoner was\r\ntransferred to Montjuich Castle, a political prison associated with\r\nmany cruelties, there to await the sailing that very day of the\r\nPhilippine mail boat. The Captain-General was the same Despujol\r\nwho had decoyed Rizal into the power of the Spaniards four years\r\nbefore. An interesting interview of some hours' duration took place\r\nbetween the governor and the prisoner, in which the clear conscience\r\nof the latter seems to have stirred some sense of shame in the man\r\nwho had so dishonorably deceived him.\r\n\r\nHe never heard of the effort of London friends to deliver him at\r\nSingapore by means of habeas-corpus proceedings. Mr. Regidor furnished\r\nthe legal inspiration and Mr. Baustead the funds for getting an opinion\r\nas to Rizal's status as a prisoner when in British waters, from Sir\r\nEdward Clarke, ex-solicitor-general of Great Britain. Captain Camus, a\r\nFilipino living in Singapore, was cabled to, money was made available\r\nin the Chartered Bank of Singapore, as Mr. Baustead's father's\r\nfirm was in business in that city, and a lawyer, now Sir Hugh Fort,\r\nK.C., of London, was retained. Secretly, in order that the attempt,\r\nif unsuccessful, might not jeopardize the prisoner, a petition was\r\npresented to the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements reciting the\r\nfacts that Doctor Jose Rizal, according to the Philippine practice of\r\npunishing Freemasons without trial, was being deprived of his liberty\r\nwithout warrant of law upon a ship then within the jurisdiction of\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\nAccording to Spanish law Rizal was being illegally held on the Spanish\r\nmail steamer Colon, for the Constitution of Spain forbade detention\r\nexcept on a judge's order, but like most Spanish laws the Constitution\r\nwas not much respected by Spanish officials. Rizal had never had a\r\nhearing before any judge, nor had any charge yet been placed against\r\nhim. The writ of habeas corpus was justified, provided the Colon were\r\na merchant ship that would be subject to British law when in British\r\nport, but the mail steamer that carried Rizal also had on board Spanish\r\nsoldiers and flew the royal flag as if it were a national transport. No\r\none was willing to deny that this condition made the ship floating\r\nSpanish territory, and the judge declined to issue the writ.\r\n\r\nRizal reached Manila on November 3 and was at once transferred to\r\nFort Santiago, at first being held in a dungeon \"incomunicado\" and\r\nlater occupying a small cell on the ground floor. Its furnishings\r\nhad to be supplied by himself and they consisted of a small rattan\r\ntable, a high-backed chair, a steamer chair of the same material,\r\nand a cot of the kind used by Spanish officers--canvas top and\r\ncollapsible frame which closed up lengthwise. His meals were sent in\r\nby his family, being carried by one of his former pupils at Dapitan,\r\nand such cooking or heating as was necessary was done on an alcohol\r\nlamp which had been presented to him in Paris by Mrs. Tavera.\r\n\r\nAn unsuccessful effort had been made earlier to get evidence against\r\nRizal by torturing his brother Paciano. For hours the elder brother had\r\nbeen seated at a table in the headquarters of the political police,\r\na thumbscrew on one hand and pen in the other, while before him\r\nwas a confession which would implicate Jose Rizal in the Katipunan\r\nuprising. The paper remained unsigned, though Paciano was hung up by\r\nthe elbows till he was insensible, and then cut down that the fall\r\nmight revive him. Three days of this maltreatment made him so ill\r\nthat there was no possibility of his signing anything, and he was\r\ncarted home.\r\n\r\nIt would not be strictly accurate to say that at the close of the\r\nnineteenth century the Spaniards of Manila were using the same tortures\r\nthat had made their name abhorrent in Europe three centuries earlier,\r\nfor there was some progress; electricity was employed at times as\r\nan improved method of causing anguish, and the thumbscrews were much\r\nmore neatly finished than those used by the Dons of the Dark Ages.\r\n\r\nRizal did not approve of the rebellion and desired to issue a manifesto\r\nto those of his countrymen who had been deceived into believing that\r\nhe was their leader. But the proclamation was not politic, for it\r\ncontained none of those fulsomely flattering phrases which passed\r\nfor patriotism in the feverish days of 1896. The address was not\r\nallowed to be made public but it was passed on to the prosecutor to\r\nform another count in the indictment of Jose Rizal for not esteeming\r\nSpanish civilization.\r\n\r\nThe following address to some Filipinos shows more clearly and\r\nunmistakably than any words of mine exactly what was the state of\r\nRizal's mind in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTRYMEN:\r\n\r\nOn my return from Spain I learned that my name had been in use,\r\namong some who were in arms, as a war-cry. The news came as a painful\r\nsurprise, but, believing it already closed, I kept silent over an\r\nincident which I considered irremediable. Now I notice indications of\r\nthe disturbances continuing and if any still, in good or bad faith, are\r\navailing themselves of my name, to stop this abuse and undeceive the\r\nunwary I hasten to address you these lines that the truth may be known.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, when I first had notice of what was being\r\nplanned, I opposed it, fought it, and demonstrated its absolute\r\nimpossibility. This is the fact, and witnesses to my words are now\r\nliving. I was convinced that the scheme was utterly absurd, and,\r\nwhat was worse, would bring great suffering.\r\n\r\nI did even more. When later, against my advice, the movement\r\nmaterialized, of my own accord I offered not alone my good offices,\r\nbut my very life, and even my name, to be used in whatever way\r\nmight seem best, toward stifling the rebellion; for, convinced of\r\nthe ills which it would bring, I considered myself fortunate if, at\r\nany sacrifice, I could prevent such useless misfortunes. This equally\r\nis of record. My countrymen, I have given proofs that I am one most\r\nanxious for liberties for our country, and I am still desirous of\r\nthem. But I place as a prior condition the education of the people,\r\nthat by means of instruction and industry our country may have an\r\nindividuality of its own and make itself worthy of these liberties. I\r\nhave recommended in my writings the study of the civic virtues,\r\nwithout which there is no redemption. I have written likewise (and I\r\nrepeat my words) that reforms, to be beneficial, must come from above,\r\nthat those which come from below are irregularly gained and uncertain.\r\n\r\nHolding these ideas, I cannot do less than condemn, and I do condemn\r\nthis uprising--as absurd, savage, and plotted behind my back--which\r\ndishonors us Filipinos and discredits those who could plead our\r\ncause. I abhor its criminal methods and disclaim all part in it,\r\npitying from the bottom of my heart the unwary who have been deceived.\r\n\r\nReturn, then, to your homes, and may God pardon those who have worked\r\nin bad faith!\r\n\r\nJose Rizal.\r\n\r\nFort Santiago, December 15, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally a court-martial was convened for Rizal's trial, in the\r\nCuartel de Espana. No trained counsel was allowed to defend him,\r\nbut a list of young army officers was presented from which he might\r\nselect a nominal defender. Among the names was one which was familiar,\r\nLuis Taviel de Andrade, and he proved to be the brother of Rizal's\r\ncompanion during his visit to the Philippines in 1887-88. The young\r\nman did his best and risked unpopularity in order to be loyal to\r\nhis client. His defense reads pitiably weak in these days but it was\r\nrisky then to say even so much.\r\n\r\nThe judge advocate in a ridiculously bombastic effusion gave an\r\nalleged sketch of Rizal's life which showed ignorance of almost every\r\nmaterial event, and then formulated the first precise charge against\r\nthe prisoner, which was that he had founded an illegal society,\r\nalleging that the Liga Filipina had for its sole object to commit\r\nthe crime of rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe second charge was that Rizal was responsible for the existing\r\nrebellion, having caused it, bringing it on by his unceasing labors. An\r\naggravating circumstance was found in the prisoner's being a native\r\nof the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe penalty of death was asked of the court, and in the event of pardon\r\nbeing granted by the crown, the prisoner should at least remain under\r\nsurveillance for the rest of his life and pay as damages 20,000 pesos.\r\n\r\nThe arguments are so absurd, the bias of the court so palpable, that\r\nit is not worth while to discuss them. The parallel proceedings in\r\nthe military trial and execution of Francisco Ferret in Barcelona in\r\n1909 caused worldwide indignation, and the illegality of almost every\r\nstep, according to Spanish law, was shown in numerous articles in\r\nthe European and American press. Rizal's case was even more brazenly\r\nunfair, but Manila was too remote and the news too carefully censored\r\nfor the facts to become known.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner's arms were tied, corded from elbow to elbow behind\r\nhis back, and thus he sat through the weary trial while the public\r\njeered him and clamored for his condemnation as the bloodthirsty\r\ncrowds jeered and clamored in the French Reign of terror.\r\n\r\nThen came the verdict and the prisoner was invited to acknowledge\r\nthe regularity of the proceedings in the farcical trial by signing\r\nthe record. To this Rizal demurred, but after a vain protest, affixed\r\nhis signature.\r\n\r\nHe was at once transferred to the Fort chapel, there to pass the last\r\ntwenty-four hours of his life in preparing for death. The military\r\nchaplain offered his services, which were courteously declined, but\r\nwhen the Jesuits came, those instructors of his youth were eagerly\r\nwelcomed.\r\n\r\nRizal's trial had awakened great interest and accounts of everything\r\nabout the prisoner were cabled by eager correspondents to the Madrid\r\nnewspapers. One of the newspaper men who visited Rizal in his cell\r\nmentions the courtesy of his reception, and relates how the prisoner\r\nplayed the host and insisted on showing his visitor those attentions\r\nwhich Spanish politeness considers due to a guest, saying that these\r\nmust be permitted, for he was in his own home. The interviewer found\r\nthe prisoner perfectly calm and natural, serious of course, but not\r\nat all overwhelmed by the near prospect of death, and in discussing\r\nhis career Rizal displayed that dispassionate attitude toward his\r\nown doings that was characteristic of him. Almost as though speaking\r\nof a stranger he mentioned that if Archbishop Nozaleda's sane view\r\nhad been taken and \"Noli Me Tangere\" not preached against, he would\r\nnot have been in prison, and perhaps the rebellion would never have\r\noccurred. It is easy for us to recognize that the author referred to\r\nthe misconception of his novel, which had arisen from the publication\r\nof the censor's extracts, which consisted of whatever could be\r\nconstrued into coming under one of the three headings of attacks on\r\nreligion, attacks on government, and reflections on Spanish character,\r\nwithout the slightest regard to the context.\r\n\r\nBut the interviewer, quite honestly, reported Rizal to be regretting\r\nhis novel instead of regretting its miscomprehension, and he seems\r\nto have been equally in error in the way he mistook Rizal's meaning\r\nabout the republicans in Spain having led him astray.\r\n\r\nRizal's exact words are not given in the newspaper account, but it is\r\nnot likely that a man would make admissions in a newspaper interview,\r\nwhich if made formally, would have saved his life. Rizal's memory\r\nhas one safeguard against the misrepresentations which the absence\r\nof any witnesses favorable to him make possible regarding his last\r\nmoments: a political retraction would have prevented his execution,\r\nand since the execution did take place, it is reasonable to believe\r\nthat Rizal died holding the views for which he had expressed himself\r\nwilling to suffer martyrdom.\r\n\r\nYet this view does not reflect upon the good faith of the reporter. It\r\nis probable that the prisoner was calling attention to the illogical\r\nresult that, though he had disregarded the advice of the radical\r\nSpaniards who urged him to violent measures, his peaceable agitation\r\nhad been misunderstood and brought him to the same situation as though\r\nhe had actually headed a rebellion by arms. His slighting opinion\r\nof his great novel was the view he had always held, for like all\r\nmen who do really great things, he was the reverse of a braggart,\r\nand in his remark that he had attempted to do great things without\r\nthe capacity for gaining success, one recognizes his remembrance of\r\nhis mother's angry prophecy foretelling failure in all he undertook.\r\n\r\nHis family waited long outside the Governor-General's place to ask\r\na pardon, but in vain; General Polavieja had to pay the price of his\r\nappointment and refused to see them.\r\n\r\nThe mother and sisters, however, were permitted to say farewell to\r\nRizal in the chapel, under the eyes of the death-watch. The prisoner\r\nhad been given the unusual privilege of not being tied, but he was\r\nnot allowed to approach near his relatives, really for fear that\r\nhe might pass some writing to them--the pretext was made that Rizal\r\nmight thus obtain the means for committing suicide.\r\n\r\nTo his sister Trinidad Rizal spoke of having nothing to give her\r\nby way of remembrance except the alcohol cooking lamp which he had\r\nbeen using, a gift, as he mentioned, from Mrs. Tavera. Then he added\r\nquickly, in English, so that the listening guard would not understand,\r\n\"There is something inside.\"\r\n\r\nThe other events of Rizal's last twenty-four hours, for he went in to\r\nthe chapel at seven in the morning of the day preceding his execution,\r\nare perplexing. What purported to be a detailed account was promptly\r\npublished in Barcelona, on Jesuit authority, but one must not forget\r\nthat Spaniards are not of the phlegmatic disposition which makes for\r\naccuracy in minute matters and even when writing history they are\r\ndramatically ificlined. So while the truthfulness, that is the intent\r\nto be fair, may not be questioned, it would not be strange if those who\r\nwrote of what happened in the chapel in Fort Santiago during Rizal's\r\nlast hours did not escape entirely from the influence of the national\r\ncharacteristics. In the main their narrative is to be accepted,\r\nbut the possibility of unconscious coloring should not be disregarded.\r\n\r\nIn substance it is alleged that Rizal greeted his old instructors\r\nand other past acquaintances in a friendly way. He asked for copies\r\nof the Gospels and the writings of Thomas-a-Kempis, desired to be\r\nformally married to Josefina, and asked to be allowed to confess. The\r\nJesuits responded that first it would be necessary to investigate\r\nhow far his beliefs conformed to the Roman Catholic teachings. Their\r\ncatechizing convinced them that he was not orthodox and a religious\r\ndebate ensued in which Rizal, after advancing all known arguments,\r\nwas completely vanquished. His marriage was made contingent upon his\r\nsigning a retraction of his published heresies.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop had prepared a form which the Jesuits believed\r\nRizal would be little likely to sign, and they secured permission\r\nto substitute a shorter one of their own which included only the\r\nabsolute essentials for reconciliation with the Church, and avoided all\r\npolitical references. They say that Rizal objected only to a disavowal\r\nof Freemasonry, stating that in England, where he held his membership,\r\nthe Masonic institution was not hostile to the Church. After some\r\nargument, he waived this point and wrote out, at a Jesuit's dictation,\r\nthe needed retraction, adding some words to strengthen it in parts,\r\nindicating his Catholic education and that the act was of his own\r\nfree will and accord.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner, the priests, and all the Spanish officials present knelt\r\nat the altar, at Rizal's suggestion, while he read his retraction\r\naloud. Afterwards he put on a blue scapular, kissed the image of\r\nthe Sacred Heart he had carved years before, heard mass as when\r\na student in the Ateneo, took communion, and read his a-Kempis or\r\nprayed in the intervals. He took breakfast with the Spanish officers,\r\nwho now regarded him very differently. At six Josefina entered and\r\nwas married to him by Father Balanguer.\r\n\r\nNow in this narrative there are some apparent discrepancies. Mention is\r\nmade of Rizal having in an access of devotion signed in a devotionary\r\nall the acts of faith, and it is said that this book was given to one\r\nof his sisters. His chapel gifts to his family have been examined,\r\nbut though there is a book of devotion, \"The Anchor of Faith,\" it\r\ncontains no other signature than the presentation on a flyleaf. As\r\nto the religious controversy: while in Dapitan Rizal carried on with\r\nFather Pio Pi, the Jesuit superior, a lengthy discussion involving the\r\ninterchange of many letters, but he succeeded in fairly maintaining\r\nhis views, and these views would hardly have caused him to be called\r\nProtestant in the Roman Catholic churches of America. Then the\r\ntheatrical reading aloud of his retraction before the altar does not\r\nconform to Rizal's known character. As to the anti-Masonic arguments,\r\nthese appear to be from a work by Monsignor Dupanloup and therefore\r\nwere not new to Rizal; furthermore, the book was in his own library.\r\n\r\nAgain, it seems strange that Rizal should have asserted that his\r\nMasonic membership was in London when in visiting St. John's Lodge,\r\nScotch Constitution, in Hongkong in November of 1891, since which\r\ndate he had not been in London, he registered as from \"Temple du\r\nhonneur de les amis francais,\" an old-established Paris lodge.\r\n\r\nAlso the sister Lucia, who was said to have been a witness of the\r\nmarriage, is not positive that it occurred, having only seen the\r\npriest at the altar in his vestments. The record of the marriage\r\nhas been stated to be in the Manila Cathedral, but it is not there,\r\nand as the Jesuit in officiating would have been representing the\r\nmilitary chaplain, the entry should have been in the Fort register,\r\nnow in Madrid. Rizal's burial, too, does not indicate that he died\r\nin the faith, yet it with the marriage has been used as an argument\r\nfor proving that the retraction must have been made.\r\n\r\nThe retraction itself appears in two versions, with slight\r\ndifferences. No one outside the Spanish faction has ever seen\r\nthe original, though the family nearly got into trouble by their\r\npersistence in trying to get sight of it after its first publication.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing might suggest some disbelief, but in fact they are only\r\nproofs of the remarks already made about the Spanish carelessness in\r\ndetails and liking for the dramatic.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes Rizal made a retraction, was married canonically,\r\nand was given what was intended to be Christian burial.\r\n\r\nThe grounds for this belief rest upon the fact that he seems never\r\nto have been estranged in faith from the Roman Catholic Church,\r\nbut he objected only to certain political and mercenary abuses. The\r\nfirst retraction is written in his style and it certainly contains\r\nnothing he could not have signed in Dapitan. In fact, Father Obach\r\nsays that when he wanted to marry Josefina on her first arrival there,\r\nRizal prepared a practically similar statement. Possibly the report of\r\nthat priest aided in outlining the draft which the Jesuits substituted\r\nfor the Archbishop's form. There is no mention of evasions or mental\r\nreservations and Rizal's renunciation of Masonry might have been\r\nqualified by the quibble that it was \"the Masonry which was an enemy\r\nof the Church\" that he was renouncing. Then since his association\r\n(not affiliation) had been with Masons not hostile to religion,\r\nhe was not abandoning these.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of this line of thought having suggested itself to\r\nhim appears in his evasions on the witness-stand at his trial. Though\r\nhe answered with absolute frankness whatever concerned himself and in\r\neveryday life was almost quixotically truthful, when cross-examined\r\nabout others who would be jeopardized by admitting his acquaintance\r\nwith them, he used the subterfuge of the symbolic names of his Masonic\r\nacquaintances. Thus he would say, \"I know no one by that name,\" since\r\ncare was always taken to employ the symbolic names in introductions\r\nand conversations.\r\n\r\nRizal's own symbolic name was \"Dimas Alang\"--Tagalog for \"Noli\r\nMe Tangere\"--and his nom de plume in some of his controversial\r\npublications. The use of that name by one of his companions on the\r\nrailroad trip to Tarlac entirely mystified a station master, as appears\r\nin the secret report of the espionage of that trip, which just preceded\r\nhis deportation to Dapitan. Another possible explanation is that, since\r\nFreemasonry professes not to disturb the duties which its members owe\r\nto God, their country or their families, he may have considered himself\r\nas a good Mason under obligation to do whatever was demanded by these\r\nsuperior interests, all three of which were at this time involved.\r\n\r\nThe argument that it was his pride that restrained him suggested to\r\nRizal the possibility of his being unconsciously under an influence\r\nwhich during his whole life he had been combating, and he may have\r\nconsidered that his duty toward God required the sacrifice of this\r\npride.\r\n\r\nFor his country his sacrifice would have been blemished were any\r\nreligious stigma to attach to it. He himself had always been careful\r\nof his own good name, and as we have said elsewhere, he told his\r\ncompanions that in their country's cause whatever they offered on the\r\naltars of patriotism must be as spotless as the sacrificial lambs of\r\nLevitical law.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, his work for a tranquil future for his family would be\r\nunfulfilled were he to die outside the Church. Josefina's anomalous\r\nstatus, justifiable when all the facts were known, would be sure\r\nto bring criticism upon her unless corrected by the better defined\r\nposition of a wife by a church marriage. Then the aged parents and\r\nthe numerous children of his sisters would by his act be saved the\r\nscandal that in a country so mediaevally pious as the Philippines\r\nwould come from having their relative die \"an unrepentant heretic.\"\r\n\r\nRizal had received from the Jesuits, while in prison, several religious\r\nbooks and pictures, which he used as remembrances for members of his\r\nfamily, writing brief dedications upon them. Then he said good-by to\r\nJosefina, asking in a low voice some question to which she answered\r\nin English, \"Yes, yes,\" and aloud inquiring how she would be able to\r\ngain a living, since all his property had been seized by the Spanish\r\ngovernment to satisfy the 20,000 pesetas costs which was included in\r\nthe sentence of death against him. Her reply was that she could earn\r\nmoney giving lessons in English.\r\n\r\nThe journey from the Fort to the place of execution, then Bagumbayan\r\nField, now called the Luneta, was on foot. His arms were tied tightly\r\nbehind his back, and he was surrounded by a heavy guard. The Jesuits\r\naccompanied him and some of his Dapitan schoolboys were in the crowd,\r\nwhile one friendly voice, that of a Scotch merchant still resident\r\nin Manila, called out in English, \"Good-by, Rizal.\"\r\n\r\nThe route was along the Malecon Drive where as a college student he\r\nhad walked with his fiancee, Leonora. Above the city walls showed the\r\ntwin towers of the Ateneo, and when he asked about them, for they were\r\nnot there in his boyhood days, he spoke of the happy years that he\r\nhad spent in the old school. The beauty of the morning, too, appealed\r\nto him, and may have recalled an experience of his '87 visit when he\r\nsaid to a friend whom he met on the beach during an early morning walk:\r\n\"Do you know that I have a sort of foreboding that some such sunshiny\r\nmorning as this I shall be out here facing a firing squad?\"\r\n\r\nTroops held back the crowds and left a large square for the tragedy,\r\nwhile artillery behind them was ready for suppressing any attempt at\r\nrescuing the prisoner. None came, however, for though Rizal's brother\r\nPaciano had joined the insurrectionary forces in Cavite when the death\r\nsentence showed there was no more hope for Jose, he had discouraged\r\nthe demonstration that had been planned as soon as he learned how\r\nscantily the insurgents were armed, hardly a score of serviceable\r\nfirearms being in the possession of their entire \"army.\"\r\n\r\nThe firing squad was of Filipino soldiers, while behind them, better\r\narmed, were Spaniards in case these tried to evade the fratricidal\r\npart assigned them. Rizal's composure aroused the curiosity of a\r\nSpanish military surgeon standing by and he asked, \"Colleague, may\r\nI feel your pulse?\" Without other reply the prisoner twisted one of\r\nhis hands as far from his body as the cords which bound him allowed,\r\nso that the other doctor could place his fingers on the wrist. The\r\nbeats were steady and showed neither excitement nor fear, was the\r\nreport made later.\r\n\r\nHis request to be allowed to face his executioners was denied as being\r\nout of the power of the commanding officer to grant, though Rizal\r\ndeclared that he did not deserve such a death, for he was no traitor\r\nto Spain. It was promised, however, that his head should be respected,\r\nand as unblindfolded and erect Rizal turned his back to receive their\r\nbullets, he twisted a hand to indicate under the shoulder where the\r\nsoldiers should aim so as to reach his heart. Then as the volley came,\r\nwith a last supreme effort of will power, he turned and fell face\r\nupwards, thus receiving the subsequent \"shots of grace\" which ended his\r\nlife, so that in form as well as fact he did not die a traitor's death.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish national air was played, that march of Cadiz which should\r\nhave recalled a violated constitution, for by the laws of Spain itself\r\nRizal was illegally executed.\r\n\r\nVivas, laughter and applause were heard, for it had been the social\r\nevent of the day, with breakfasting parties on the walls and on\r\nthe carriages, full of interested onlookers of both sexes, lined up\r\nconveniently near for the sightseeing.\r\n\r\nThe troops defiled past the dead body, as though reviewed by it,\r\nfor the most commanding figure of all was that which lay lifeless,\r\nbut the center of all eyes. An officer, realizing the decency due to\r\ndeath, drew his handkerchief from the dead man's pocket and spread\r\nthe silk over the calm face. A crimson stain soon marked the whiteness\r\nemblematic of the pure life that had just ended, and with the glorious\r\nblue overhead, the tricolor of Liberty, which had just claimed another\r\nmartyr, was revealed in its richest beauty.\r\n\r\nSir Hugh Clifford (now Governor of Ceylon), in Blackwood's Magazine,\r\n\"The Story of Jose Rizal, the Filipino; A Fragment of Recent Asiatic\r\nHistory,\" comments as follows on the disgraceful doing of that day:\r\n\r\n\"It was,\" he writes, \"early morning, December 30, 1896, and the bright\r\nsunshine of the tropics streamed down upon the open space, casting\r\nhard fantastic shadows, and drenching with its splendor two crowds\r\nof sightseers. The one was composed of Filipinos, cowed, melancholy,\r\nsullen, gazing through hopeless eyes at the final scene in the life of\r\ntheir great countryman--the man who had dared to champion their cause,\r\nand to tell the world the story of their miseries; the other was blithe\r\nof air, gay with the uniforms of officers and the bright dresses of\r\nSpanish ladies, the men jesting and laughing, the women shamelessly\r\napplauding with waving handkerchiefs and clapping palms, all alike\r\ntriumphing openly in the death of the hated 'Indian,' the 'brother\r\nof the water-buffalo,' whose insolence had wounded their pride.\r\n\r\n* * * Turning away, sick at heart, from the contemplation of this\r\nbitter tragedy, it is with a thrill of almost vindictive satisfaction\r\nthat one remembers that less than eighteen months later the Luneta\r\nechoed once more to the sound of a mightier fusillade--the roar of\r\nthe great guns with which the battle of Manila Bay was fought and won.\r\n\r\n* * * And if in the moment of his last supreme agony the power to probe\r\nthe future had been vouchsafed to Jose Rizal, would he not have died\r\nhappy in the knowledge that the land he loved so dearly was very soon\r\nto be transferred into such safekeeping?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nThe After-Life in Memory\r\n\r\nAn hour or so after the shooting a dead-wagon from San Juan de Dios\r\nHospital took Rizal's body to Paco Cemetery. The civil governor of\r\nManila was in charge and there also were present the members of a\r\nChurch society whose duty it was to attend executions.\r\n\r\nRizal had been wearing a black suit which he had obtained for his\r\nEuropean trip, and a derby hat, not only appropriate for a funeral\r\noccasion because of their somber color, but also more desirable\r\nthan white both for the full day's wear, since they had to be put\r\non before the twenty-four hours in the chapel, and for the lying on\r\nthe ground which would follow the execution of the sentence. A plain\r\nbox inclosed the remains thus dressed, for even the hat was picked\r\nup and encoffined.\r\n\r\nNo visitors were admitted to the cemetery while the interment was\r\ngoing on, and for several weeks after guards watched over the grave,\r\nlest Filipinos might come by night to steal away the body and apportion\r\nthe clothing among themselves as relics of a martyr. Even the exact\r\nspot of the interment was intended to be unknown, but friends of the\r\nfamily were among the attendants at the burial and dropped into the\r\ngrave a marble slab which had been furnished them, bearing the initials\r\nof the full baptismal name, Jose Protasio Rizal, in reversed order.\r\n\r\nThe entry of the burial, like that of three of his followers of the\r\nLiga Filipina who were among the dozen executed a fortnight later,\r\nwas on the back flyleaf of the cemetery register, with three or four\r\nwords of explanation later erased and now unknown. On the previous\r\npage was the entry of a suicide's death, and following it is that of\r\nthe British Consul who died on the eve of Manila's surrender and whose\r\nbody, by the Archbishop's permission, was stored in a Paco niche till\r\nit could be removed to the Protestant (foreigners') cemetery at San\r\nPedro Macati.\r\n\r\nThe day of Rizal's execution, the day of his birth and the day of\r\nhis first leaving his native land was a Wednesday. All that night,\r\nand the next day, the celebration continued the volunteers, who\r\nwere particularly responsible, like their fellows in Cuba, for the\r\natrocities which disgraced Spain's rule in the Philippines, being\r\nespecially in evidence. It was their clamor that had made the bringing\r\nback of Rizal possible, their demands for his death had been most\r\nprominent in his so-called trial, and now they were praising themselves\r\nfor their \"patriotism.\" The landlords had objected to having their land\r\ntitles questioned and their taxes raised. The other friar orders, as\r\nwell as these, were opposed to a campaign which sought their transfer\r\nfrom profitable parishes to self-sacrificing missionary labors. But\r\nprobably none of them as organizations desired Rizal's death.\r\n\r\nRizal's old teachers wished for the restoration of their former\r\npupil to the faith of his childhood, from which they believed he had\r\ndeparted. Through Despujol they seem to have worked for an opportunity\r\nfor influencing him, yet his death was certainly not in their plans.\r\n\r\nSome Filipinos, to save themselves, tried to complicate Rizal with the\r\nKatipunan uprising by palpable falsehoods. But not every man is heroic\r\nand these can hardly be blamed, for if all the alleged confessions\r\nwere not secured by actual torture, they were made through fear of\r\nit, since in 1896 there was in Manila the legal practice of causing\r\nbodily suffering by mediaeval methods supplemented by torments devised\r\nby modern science.\r\n\r\nAmong the Spaniards in Manila then, reenforced by those whom\r\nthe uprising had frightened out of the provinces, were a few who\r\nrealized that they belonged among the classes caricatured in Rizal's\r\nnovels--some incompetent, others dishonest, cruel ones, the illiterate,\r\nwretched specimens that had married outside their race to get money\r\nand find wives who would not know them for what they were, or drunken\r\nhusbands of viragoes. They came to the Philippines because they were\r\nbelow the standard of their homeland. These talked the loudest and\r\nthus dominated the undisciplined volunteers. With nothing divine about\r\nthem, since they had not forgotten, they did not forgive. So when the\r\nTondo \"discoverer\" of the Katipunan fancied he saw opportunity for\r\npromotion in fanning their flame of wrath, they claimed their victims,\r\nand neither the panic-stricken populace nor the weak-kneed government\r\ncould withstand them.\r\n\r\nOnce more it must be repeated that Spain has no monopoly of bad\r\ncharacters, nor suffers in the comparison of her honorable citizenship\r\nwith that of other nationalities, but her system in the Philippines\r\npermitted abuses which good governments seek to avoid or, in the\r\nrare occasions when this is impossible, aim to punish. Here was the\r\nSpanish shortcoming, for these were the defects which made possible\r\nso strange a story as this biography unfolds. \"Jose Rizal,\" said a\r\nrecent Spanish writer, \"was the living indictment of Spain's wretched\r\ncolonial system.\"\r\n\r\nRizal's family were scattered among the homes of friends brave enough\r\nto risk the popular resentment against everyone in any way identified\r\nwith the victim of their prejudice.\r\n\r\nAs New Year's eve approached, the bands ceased playing and the marchers\r\nstopped parading. Their enthusiasm had worn itself out in the two\r\ncontinuous days of celebration, and there was a lessening of the\r\nhospitality with which these \"heroes\" who had \"saved the fatherland\"\r\nat first had been entertained. Their great day of the year became of\r\nmore interest than further remembrance of the bloody occurrence on\r\nBagumbayan Field. To those who mourned a son and a brother the change\r\nmust have come as a welcome relief, for even sorrow has its degrees,\r\nand the exultation over the death embittered their grief.\r\n\r\nTo the remote and humble home where Rizal's widow and the sister\r\nto whom he had promised a parting gift were sheltered, the Dapitan\r\nschoolboy who had attended his imprisoned teacher brought an alcohol\r\ncooking-lamp. It was midnight before they dared seek the \"something\"\r\nwhich Rizal had said was inside. The alcohol was emptied from the tank\r\nand, with a convenient hairpin, a tightly folded and doubled piece of\r\npaper was dislodged from where it had been wedged in, out of sight,\r\nso that its rattling might not betray it.\r\n\r\nIt was a single sheet of notepaper bearing verses in Rizal's well-known\r\nhandwriting and familiar style. Hastily the young boy copied them,\r\nmaking some minor mistakes owing to his agitation and unfamiliarity\r\nwith the language, and the copy, without explanation, was mailed to\r\nMr. Basa in Hongkong. Then the original was taken by the two women with\r\ntheir few possessions and they fled to join the insurgents in Cavite.\r\n\r\nThe following translation of these verses was made by Charles\r\nDerbyshire:\r\n\r\n\r\n  My Last Farewell\r\n\r\n  Farewell, dear Fatherland, clime of the sun caress'd,\r\n  Pearl of the Orient seas, our Eden lost!\r\n  Gladly now I go to give thee this faded life's best,\r\n  And were it brighter, fresher, or more blest,\r\n  Still would I give it thee, nor count the cost.\r\n\r\n  On the field of battle, 'mid the frenzy of fight,\r\n  Others have given their lives, without doubt or heed;\r\n  The place matters not--cypress or laurel or lily white,\r\n  Scaffold of open plain, combat or martyrdom's plight,\r\n  'Tis ever the same, to serve our home and country's need.\r\n\r\n  I die just when I see the dawn break,\r\n  Through the gloom of night, to herald the day;\r\n  And if color is lacking my blood thou shalt take,\r\n  Pour'd out at need for thy dear sake,\r\n  To dye with its crimson the waking ray.\r\n\r\n  My dreams, when life first opened to me,\r\n  My dreams, when the hopes of youth beat high,\r\n  Were to see thy lov'd face, O gem of the Orient sea,\r\n  From gloom and grief, from care and sorrow free;\r\n  No blush on thy brow, no tear in thine eye\r\n\r\n  Dream of my life, my living and burning desire,\r\n  All hail! cries the soul that is now to take flight;\r\n  All hail! And sweet it is for thee to expire;\r\n  To die for thy sake, that thou mayst aspire;\r\n  And sleep in thy bosom eternity's long night.\r\n\r\n  If over my grave some day thou seest grow,\r\n  In the grassy sod, a humble flower,\r\n  Draw it to thy lips and kiss my soul so,\r\n  While I may feel on my brow in the cold tomb below\r\n  The touch of thy tenderness, thy breath's warm power.\r\n\r\n  Let the moon beam over me soft and serene,\r\n  Let the dawn shed over me its radiant flashes,\r\n  Let the wind with sad lament over me keen;\r\n  And if on my cross a bird should be seen,\r\n  Let it trill there its hymn of peace to my ashes.\r\n\r\n  Let the sun draw the vapors up to the sky,\r\n  And heavenward in purity bear my tardy protest;\r\n  Let some kind soul o'er my untimely fate sigh,\r\n  And in the still evening a prayer be lifted on high\r\n  From thee, O my country, that in God I may rest.\r\n\r\n  Pray for all those that hapless have died,\r\n  For all who have suffered the unmeasur'd pain;\r\n  For our mothers that bitterly their woes have cried,\r\n  For widows and orphans, for captives by torture tried;\r\n  And then for thyself that redemption thou mayst gain.\r\n\r\n  And when the dark night wraps the graveyard around,\r\n  With only the dead in their vigil to see;\r\n  Break not my repose or the mystery profound,\r\n  And perchance thou mayst hear a sad hymn resound;\r\n  'Tis I, O my country, raising a song unto thee.\r\n\r\n  When even my grave is remembered no more,\r\n  Unmark'd by never a cross nor a stone;\r\n  Let the plow sweep through it, the spade turn it o'er,\r\n  That my ashes may carpet thy earthly floor,\r\n  Before into nothingness at last they are blown.\r\n\r\n  Then will oblivion bring to me no care,\r\n  As over thy vales and plains I sweep;\r\n  Throbbing and cleansed in thy space and air,\r\n  With color and light, with song and lament I fare,\r\n  Ever repeating the faith that I keep.\r\n\r\n  My Fatherland ador'd, that sadness to my sorrow lends,\r\n  Beloved Filipinas, hear now my last good-by!\r\n  I give thee all: parents and kindred and friends;\r\n  For I go where no slave before the oppressor bends,\r\n  Where faith can never kill, and God reigns e'er on high!\r\n\r\n  Farewell to you all, from my soul torn away,\r\n  Friends of my childhood in the home dispossessed!\r\n  Give thanks that I rest from the wearisome day!\r\n  Farewell to thee, too, sweet friend that lightened my way;\r\n  Beloved creatures all, farewell! In death there is rest!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time such belongings of Rizal as had been intrusted to\r\nJosefina had been in the care of the American Consul in Manila\r\nfor as the adopted daughter of the American Taufer she had claimed\r\nhis protection. Stories are told of her as a second Joan of Arc,\r\nbut it is not likely that one of the few rifles which the insurgents\r\nhad would be turned over to a woman. After a short experience in the\r\nfield, much of it spent in nursing her sister-in-law through a fever,\r\nMrs. Rizal returned to Manila. Then came a brief interview with the\r\nGovernor-General. He had learned that his \"administrative powers\"\r\nto exile without trial did not extend to foreigners, but by advice\r\nof her consul she soon sailed for Hongkong.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rizal at first lived in the Basa home and received\r\nconsiderable attention from the Filipino colony. There was too\r\ngreat a difference between the freedom accorded Englishwomen and the\r\nrestraints surrounding Spanish ladies however, to avoid difficulties\r\nand misunderstandings, for very long. She returned to her adopted\r\nfather's house and after his death married Vicente Abad, a Cebuan,\r\nson of a Spaniard who had been prominent in the Tabacalera Company\r\nand had become an agent of theirs in Hongkong after he had completed\r\nhis studies there.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after Rizal's execution a dozen other members of his\r\n\"Liga Filipina\" were executed on the Luneta. One was a millionaire,\r\nFrancisco Roxas, who had lost his mind, and believing that he was in\r\nchurch, calmly spread his handkerchief on the ground and knelt upon\r\nit as had been his custom in childhood. An old man, Moises Salvador,\r\nhad been crippled by torture so that he could not stand and had to\r\nbe laid upon the grass to be shot. The others met their death standing.\r\n\r\nThat bravery and cruelty do not usually go together was amply\r\ndemonstrated in Polavieja's case and by the volunteers. The latter\r\nonce showed their patriotism, after a banquet, by going to the water's\r\nedge on the Luneta and firing volleys at the insurgents across the\r\nbay, miles away. The General was relieved of his command after he had\r\nfortified a camp with siege guns against the bolo-armed insurgents,\r\nwho, however, by captures from the Spaniards were gradually becoming\r\nbetter equipped. But he did not escape condemnation from his own\r\ncountrymen, and when he visited Giron, years after he had returned to\r\nthe Peninsula, circulars were distributed among the crowd, bearing\r\nRizal's last verses, his portrait, and the charge that to Polavieja\r\nwas due the loss of the Philippines to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Katipunan insurgents in time were bought off by General Primo de\r\nRivera, once more returned to the Islands for further plunder. The\r\nmoney question does not concern Rizal's life, but his prediction of\r\nsuffering to the country came true, for while the leaders with the\r\nfirst payment and hostages for their own safety sailed away to live\r\nsecurely in Hongkong, the poorer people who remained suffered the\r\nvengeance of a government which seems never to have kept a promise to\r\nits people. Whether reforms were pledged is disputed, but if any were,\r\nthey never were put into effect. No more money was paid, and the first\r\ninstalment, preserved by the prudent leaders, equipped them when,\r\nowing to Dewey's victory, they were enabled to return to their country.\r\n\r\nOn the first anniversary of Rizal's execution some Spaniards desecrated\r\nthe grave, while on one of the niches, rented for the purpose, many\r\nfeet away, the family hung wreaths with Tagalog dedications but\r\nno name.\r\n\r\nAugust 13, 1898, the Spanish flag came down from Fort Santiago in\r\nevidence of the surrender of the city. At the first opportunity\r\nPaco Cemetery was visited and Rizal's body raised for a more decent\r\ninterment. Vainly his shoes were searched for a last message which\r\nhe had said might be concealed there, for the dampness had made any\r\npaper unrecognizable. Then a simple cross was erected, resting on a\r\nmarble block carved, as had been the smaller one which secretly had\r\nfirst marked the spot, with the reversed initials \"R. P. J.\"\r\n\r\nThe first issue of a Filipino newspaper under the new government was\r\nentirely dedicated to Rizal. The second anniversary of his execution\r\nwas observed with general unanimity, his countrymen demonstrating that\r\nthose who were seeing the dawn of the new day were not forgetful of\r\nthe greatest of those who had fallen in the night, to paraphrase his\r\nown words.\r\n\r\nHis widow returned and did live by giving lessons in English, at first\r\nprivately in Cebu, where one of her pupils was the present and first\r\nSpeaker of the Philippine Assembly, and afterwards as a government\r\nemployee in the public schools and in the \"Liceo\" of Manila.\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of civil government a new province was formed\r\nnear Manila, including the land across the lake to which, as a lad\r\nin Kalamba, Rizal had often wonderingly looked, and the name of Rizal\r\nProvince was given it.\r\n\r\nLater when public holidays were provided for by the new laws, the\r\nanniversary of Rizal's execution was in the list, and it has become the\r\ngreat day of the year, with the entire community uniting, for Spaniards\r\nno longer consider him to have been a traitor to Spain and the American\r\nauthorities have founded a government in conformity with his teachings.\r\n\r\nOn one of these occasions, December 30, 1905, William Jennings Bryan,\r\n\"The Great American Commoner,\" gave the Rizal Day address, in the\r\ncourse of which he said:\r\n\r\n\"If you will permit me to draw one lesson from the life of Rizal,\r\nI will say that he presents an example of a great man consecrated\r\nto his country's welfare. He, though dead, is a living rebuke to the\r\nscholar who selfishly enjoys the privilege of an ample education and\r\ndoes not impart the benefits of it to his fellows. His example is worth\r\nmuch to the people of these Islands, to the child who reads of him,\r\nto the young and old.\"\r\n\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of Rizal's birth was observed throughout the\r\nArchipelago with exercises in every community by public schools now\r\norganized along the lines he wished, to make self-dependent, capable\r\nmen and women, strong in body as in mind, knowing and claiming their\r\nown rights, and recognizing and respecting those of others.\r\n\r\nHis father died early in the year that the flags changed, but the\r\nmother lived to see honor done her son and to prove herself as worthy,\r\nfor when the Philippine Legislature wanted to set aside a considerable\r\nsum for her use, she declined it with the true and rightfully\r\nproud assertion, that her family had never been patriotic for\r\nmoney. Her funeral, in 1911, was an occasion of public mourning, the\r\nGovernor-General, Legislature and chief men of the Islands attending,\r\nand all public business being suspended by proclamation for the day.\r\n\r\nA capitol for the representatives of the free people of the\r\nPhilippines, and worthy of the pioneer democratic government in the\r\nOrient, is soon to be erected on the Luneta, facing the big Rizal\r\nmonument which will mark the place of execution of the man who gave\r\nhis life to prepare his countrymen for the changed conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] -- I take the liberty, here, of citing an instance of this. In\r\n1861, when I found myself on the West Coast of Mexico, a dozen\r\nbackwoods families determined upon settling in Sonora (forming an\r\noasis in the desert); a plan which was frustrated by the invasion\r\nat that time of the European powers. Many native farmers awaited\r\nthe arrival of these immigrants in order to take them under their\r\nprotection. The value of land in consequence of the announcement of\r\nthe project rose very considerably.\r\n\r\n[2] -- See Appendix.",
