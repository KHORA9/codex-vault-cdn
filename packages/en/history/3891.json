Never,\r\nperhaps, did he make a full disclosure to any one of them, and certainly\r\nhe spoke with sincerity, to but very few.  He invariably kept the reins of\r\nall secret intrigues in his own hand; and thence, doubtless, arose the\r\nwant of cooperation and the weakness which were so conspicuous in his\r\nmeasures.  From these causes considerable chasms will be found in the\r\ndetailed history of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nIn order to become thoroughly acquainted with the latter years of the\r\nreign of Louis XV., memoirs written by the Duc de Choiseul, the Duc\r\nd’Aiguillon, the Marechal de Richelieu, and the Duc de La Vauguyon,\r\nshould be before us.\r\n\r\n[I heard Le Marechal de Richelieu desire M. Campan, who was librarian to\r\nthe Queen, not to buy the Memoirs which would certainly be attributed to\r\nhim after his death, declaring them false by anticipation; and adding that\r\nhe was ignorant of orthography, and had never amused himself with writing.\r\nShortly after the death of the Marshal, one Soulavie put forth Memoirs of\r\nthe Marechal de Richelieu.]\r\n\r\nTo give us a faithful portrait of the unfortunate reign of Louis XVI.,\r\nthe Marechal du Muy, M. de Maurepas, M. de Vergennes, M. de Malesherbes,\r\nthe Duc d’Orleans, M. de La Fayette, the Abby de Vermond, the Abbe\r\nMontesquiou, Mirabeau, the Duchesse de Polignac, and the Duchesse de\r\nLuynes should have noted faithfully in writing all the transactions in\r\nwhich they took decided parts.  The secret political history of a later\r\nperiod has been disseminated among a much greater number of persons;\r\nthere are Ministers who have published memoirs, but only when they had\r\ntheir own measures to justify, and then they confined themselves to the\r\nvindication of their own characters, without which powerful motive they\r\nprobably would have written nothing.  In general, those nearest to the\r\nSovereign, either by birth or by office, have left no memoirs; and in\r\nabsolute monarchies the mainsprings of great events will be found in\r\nparticulars which the most exalted persons alone could know.  Those who\r\nhave had but little under their charge find no subject in it for a book;\r\nand those who have long borne the burden of public business conceive\r\nthemselves to be forbidden by duty, or by respect for authority, to\r\ndisclose all they know.  Others, again, preserve notes, with the\r\nintention of reducing them to order when they shall have reached the\r\nperiod of a happy leisure; vain illusion of the ambitious, which they\r\ncherish, for the most part, but as a veil to conceal from their sight\r\nthe hateful image of their inevitable downfall! and when it does at\r\nlength take place, despair or chagrin deprives them of fortitude to\r\ndwell upon the dazzling period which they never cease to regret.\r\n\r\nLouis XVI.  meant to write his own memoirs; the manner in which his\r\nprivate papers were arranged indicated this design.  The Queen also had\r\nthe same intention; she long preserved a large correspondence, and a great\r\nnumber of minute reports, made in the spirit and upon the event of the\r\nmoment.  But after the 20th of June, 1792, she was obliged to burn the\r\nlarger portion of what she had so collected, and the remainder were\r\nconveyed out of France.\r\n\r\nConsidering the rank and situations of the persons I have named as capable\r\nof elucidating by their writings the history of our political storms, it\r\nwill not be imagined that I aim at placing myself on a level with them;\r\nbut I have spent half my life either with the daughters of Louis XV. or\r\nwith Marie Antoinette.  I knew the characters of those Princesses; I\r\nbecame privy to some extraordinary facts, the publication of which may be\r\ninteresting, and the truth of the details will form the merit of my work.\r\n\r\nI was very young when I was placed about the Princesses, the daughters of\r\nLouis XV., in the capacity of reader.  I was acquainted with the Court of\r\nVersailles before the time of the marriage of Louis XVI. with the\r\nArchduchess Marie Antoinette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME CAMPAN\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father, who was employed in the department of Foreign Affairs, enjoyed\r\nthe reputation due to his talents and to his useful labours.  He had\r\ntravelled much.  Frenchmen, on their return home from foreign countries,\r\nbring with them a love for their own, increased in warmth; and no man was\r\nmore penetrated with this feeling, which ought to be the first virtue of\r\nevery placeman, than my father.  Men of high title, academicians, and\r\nlearned men, both natives and foreigners, sought my father’s acquaintance,\r\nand were gratified by being admitted into his house.\r\n\r\nTwenty years before the Revolution I often heard it remarked that the\r\nimposing character of the power of Louis XIV. was no longer to be found in\r\nthe Palace of Versailles; that the institutions of the ancient monarchy\r\nwere rapidly sinking; and that the people, crushed beneath the weight of\r\ntaxes, were miserable, though silent; but that they began to give ear to\r\nthe bold speeches of the philosophers, who loudly proclaimed their\r\nsufferings and their rights; and, in short, that the age would not pass\r\naway without the occurrence of some great outburst, which would unsettle\r\nFrance, and change the course of its progress.\r\n\r\nThose who thus spoke were almost all partisans of M. Turgot’s system of\r\nadministration: they were Mirabeau the father, Doctor Quesnay, Abbe\r\nBandeau, and Abbe Nicoli, charge d’affaires to Leopold, Grand Duke of\r\nTuscany, and as enthusiastic an admirer of the maxims of the innovators as\r\nhis Sovereign.\r\n\r\nMy father sincerely respected the purity of intention of these\r\npoliticians.  With them he acknowledged many abuses in the Government; but\r\nhe did not give these political sectarians credit for the talent necessary\r\nfor conducting a judicious reform.  He told them frankly that in the art\r\nof moving the great machine of Government, the wisest of them was inferior\r\nto a good magistrate; and that if ever the helm of affairs should be put\r\ninto their hands, they would be speedily checked in the execution of their\r\nschemes by the immeasurable difference existing between the most brilliant\r\ntheories and the simplest practice of administration.\r\n\r\nDestiny having formerly placed me near crowned heads, I now amuse my\r\nsolitude when in retirement with collecting a variety of facts which may\r\nprove interesting to my family when I shall be no more.  The idea of\r\ncollecting all the interesting materials which my memory affords occurred\r\nto me from reading the work entitled “Paris, Versailles, and the Provinces\r\nin the Eighteenth Century.”  That work, composed by a man accustomed to\r\nthe best society, is full of piquant anecdotes, nearly all of which have\r\nbeen recognised as true by the contemporaries of the author.  I have put\r\ntogether all that concerned the domestic life of an unfortunate Princess,\r\nwhose reputation is not yet cleared of the stains it received from the\r\nattacks of calumny, and who justly merited a different lot in life, a\r\ndifferent place in the opinion of mankind after her fall.  These memoirs,\r\nwhich were finished ten years ago, have met with the approbation of some\r\npersons; and my son may, perhaps, think proper to print them after my\r\ndecease.\r\n\r\nJ.  L.  H.  C.\r\n\r\n--When Madame Campan wrote these lines, she did not anticipate that the\r\ndeath of her son would precede her own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORIC COURT MEMOIRS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIE ANTOINETTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMOIR OF MADAME CAMPAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEANNE LOUISE HENRIETTE GENET was born in Paris on the 6th of October,\r\n1752.  M. Genet, her father, had obtained, through his own merit and the\r\ninfluence of the Duc de Choiseul, the place of first clerk in the Foreign\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nLiterature, which he had cultivated in his youth, was often the solace of\r\nhis leisure hours.  Surrounded by a numerous family, he made the\r\ninstruction of his children his chief recreation, and omitted nothing\r\nwhich was necessary to render them highly accomplished.  His clever and\r\nprecocious daughter Henriette was very early accustomed to enter society,\r\nand to take an intelligent interest in current topics and public events.\r\nAccordingly, many of her relations being connected with the Court or\r\nholding official positions, she amassed a fund of interesting\r\nrecollections and characteristic anecdotes, some gathered from personal\r\nexperience, others handed down by old friends of the family.\r\n\r\n“The first event which made any impression on me in my childhood,” she\r\nsays in her reminiscences, “was the attempt of Damiens to assassinate\r\nLouis XV.  This occurrence struck me so forcibly that the most minute\r\ndetails relating to the confusion and grief which prevailed at Versailles\r\non that day seem as present to my imagination as the most recent events. I\r\nhad dined with my father and mother, in company with one of their friends.\r\nThe drawing-room was lighted up with a number of candles, and four\r\ncard-tables were already occupied, when a friend of the gentleman of the\r\nhouse came in, with a pale and terrified countenance, and said, in a voice\r\nscarcely audible, ‘I bring you terrible news.  The King has been\r\nassassinated!’  Two ladies in the company fainted; a brigadier of the Body\r\nGuards threw down his cards and cried out, ‘I do not wonder at it; it is\r\nthose rascally Jesuits.’--‘What are you saying, brother?’ cried a lady,\r\nflying to him; ‘would you get yourself arrested?’--‘Arrested!  For what?\r\nFor unmasking those wretches who want a bigot for a King?’  My father came\r\nin; he recommended circumspection, saying that the blow was not mortal,\r\nand that all meetings ought to be suspended at so critical a moment.  He\r\nhad brought the chaise for my mother, who placed me on her knees.  We\r\nlived in the Avenue de Paris, and throughout our drive I heard incessant\r\ncries and sobs from the footpaths.\r\n\r\n“At last I saw a man arrested; he was an usher of the King’s chamber, who\r\nhad gone mad, and was crying out, ‘Yes, I know them; the wretches! the\r\nvillains!’  Our chaise was stopped by this bustle.  My mother recognised\r\nthe unfortunate man who had been seized; she gave his name to the trooper\r\nwho had stopped him.  The poor usher was therefore merely conducted to the\r\ngens d’armes’ guardroom, which was then in the avenue.\r\n\r\n“I have often heard M. de Landsmath, equerry and master of the hounds, who\r\nused to come frequently to my father’s, say that on the news of the\r\nattempt on the King’s life he instantly repaired to his Majesty. I cannot\r\nrepeat the coarse expressions he made use of to encourage his Majesty; but\r\nhis account of the affair, long afterwards, amused the parties in which he\r\nwas prevailed on to relate it, when all apprehensions respecting the\r\nconsequences of the event had subsided.  This M. de Landsmath was an old\r\nsoldier, who had given proofs of extraordinary valour; nothing had been\r\nable to soften his manners or subdue his excessive bluntness to the\r\nrespectful customs of the Court.  The King was very fond of him.  He\r\npossessed prodigious strength, and had often contended with Marechal Saxe,\r\nrenowned for his great bodily power, in trying the strength of their\r\nrespective wrists.\r\n\r\n[One day when the King was hunting in the forest of St. Germain,\r\nLandemath, riding before him, wanted a cart, filled with the slime of a\r\npond that had just been cleansed, to draw up out of the way. The carter\r\nresisted, and even answered with impertinence. Landsmath, without\r\ndismounting, seized him by the breast of his coat, lifted him up, and\r\nthrew him into his cart.--MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\n“M. de Landsmath had a thundering voice.  When he came into the King’s\r\napartment he found the Dauphin and Mesdames, his Majesty’s daughters,\r\nthere; the Princesses, in tears, surrounded the King’s bed.  Send out all\r\nthese weeping women, Sire,’ said the old equerry; ‘I want to speak to you\r\nalone: The King made a sign to the Princesses to withdraw.  ‘Come,’ said\r\nLandsmath, ‘your wound is nothing; you had plenty of waistcoats and\r\nflannels on.’  Then uncovering his breast, ‘Look here,’ said he, showing\r\nfour or five great scars, ‘these are something like wounds; I received\r\nthem thirty years ago; now cough as loud as you can.’  The King did so.\r\n‘‘Tis nothing at all,’ said Landsmath; ‘you must laugh at it; we shall\r\nhunt a stag together in four days.’--‘But suppose the blade was poisoned,’\r\nsaid the King.  ‘Old grandams’ tales,’ replied Landsmath; ‘if it had been\r\nso, the waistcoats and flannels would have rubbed the poison off.’  The\r\nKing was pacified, and passed a very good night.\r\n\r\n“His Majesty one day asked M. de Landsmath how old he was.  He was aged,\r\nand by no means fond of thinking of his age; he evaded the question. A\r\nfortnight later, Louis XV. took a paper out of his pocket and read aloud:\r\n‘On such a day in the month of one thousand six hundred and eighty, was\r\nbaptised by me, rector of ------, the son of the high and mighty lord,’\r\netc.  ‘What’s that?’ said Landsmath, angrily; ‘has your Majesty been\r\nprocuring the certificate of my baptism?’--‘There it is, you see,\r\nLandsmath,’ said the King.  ‘Well, Sire, hide it as fast as you can; a\r\nprince entrusted with the happiness of twenty-five millions of people\r\nought not wilfully to hurt the feelings of a single individual.’\r\n\r\n“The King learned that Landsmath had lost his confessor, a missionary\r\npriest of the parish of Notre-Dame.  It was the custom of the Lazarists to\r\nexpose their dead with the face uncovered.  Louis XV. wished to try his\r\nequerry’s firmness.  ‘You have lost your confessor, I hear,’ said the\r\nKing.  ‘Yes, Sire.’--‘He will be exposed with his face bare?’--‘Such is\r\nthe custom.’--‘I command you to go and see him.’--‘Sire, my confessor was\r\nmy friend; it would be very painful to me.’--‘No matter; I command\r\nyou.’--‘Are you really in earnest, Sire?’--‘Quite so.’--‘It would be the\r\nfirst time in my life that I had disobeyed my sovereign’s order.  I will\r\ngo.’ The next day the King at his levee, as soon as he perceived\r\nLandsmath, said, ‘Have you done as I desired you,\r\nLandsmath?’--‘Undoubtedly, Sire.’--‘Well, what did you see?’--‘Faith, I\r\nsaw that your Majesty and I are no great shakes!’\r\n\r\n“At the death of Queen Maria Leczinska, M. Campan,--[Her father-in-law,\r\nafterwards secretary to Marie Antoinette.]--then an officer of the\r\nchamber, having performed several confidential duties, the King asked\r\nMadame Adelaide how he should reward him.  She requested him to create an\r\noffice in his household of master of the wardrobe, with a salary of a\r\nthousand crowns.  ‘I will do so,’ said the King; ‘it will be an honourable\r\ntitle; but tell Campan not to add a single crown to his expenses, for you\r\nwill see they will never pay him.’\r\n\r\n“Louis XV., by his dignified carriage, and the amiable yet majestic\r\nexpression of his features, was worthy to succeed to Louis the Great. But\r\nhe too frequently indulged in secret pleasures, which at last were sure to\r\nbecome known.  During several winters, he was passionately fond of\r\n‘candles’ end balls’, as he called those parties amongst the very lowest\r\nclasses of society.  He got intelligence of the picnics given by the\r\ntradesmen, milliners, and sempstresses of Versailles, whither he repaired\r\nin a black domino, and masked, accompanied by the captain of his Guards,\r\nmasked like himself.  His great delight was to go ‘en brouette’--[In a\r\nkind of sedan-chair, running on two wheels, and drawn by a\r\nchairman.]--Care was always taken to give notice to five or six officers\r\nof the King’s or Queen’s chamber to be there, in order that his Majesty\r\nmight be surrounded by people on whom he could depend, without finding it\r\ntroublesome.  Probably the captain of the Guards also took other\r\nprecautions of this description on his part.  My father-in-law, when the\r\nKing and he were both young, has often made one amongst the servants\r\ndesired to attend masked at these parties, assembled in some garret, or\r\nparlour of a public-house.  In those times, during the carnival, masked\r\ncompanies had a right to join the citizens’ balls; it was sufficient that\r\none of the party should unmask and name himself.\r\n\r\n“These secret excursions, and his too habitual intercourse with ladies\r\nmore distinguished for their personal charms than for the advantages of\r\neducation, were no doubt the means by which the King acquired many vulgar\r\nexpressions which otherwise would never have reached his ears.\r\n\r\n“Yet amidst the most shameful excesses the King sometimes suddenly resumed\r\nthe dignity of his rank in a very noble manner.  The familiar courtiers of\r\nLouis XV. had one day abandoned themselves to the unrestrained gaiety, of\r\na supper, after returning from the chase.  Each boasted of and described\r\nthe beauty of his mistress.  Some of them amused themselves with giving a\r\nparticular account of their wives’ personal defects.  An imprudent word,\r\naddressed to Louis XV., and applicable only to the Queen, instantly\r\ndispelled all the mirth of the entertainment. The King assumed his regal\r\nair, and knocking with his knife on the table twice or thrice, ‘Gentlemen;\r\nsaid he, ‘here is the King!’\r\n\r\n“Those men who are most completely abandoned to dissolute manners are not,\r\non that account, insensible to virtue in women.  The Comtesse de Perigord\r\nwas as beautiful as virtuous.  During some excursions she made to Choisy,\r\nwhither she had been invited, she perceived that the King took great\r\nnotice of her.  Her demeanour of chilling respect, her cautious\r\nperseverance in shunning all serious conversation with the monarch, were\r\ninsufficient to extinguish this rising flame, and he at length addressed a\r\nletter to her, worded in the most passionate terms.  This excellent woman\r\ninstantly formed her resolution: honour forbade her returning the King’s\r\npassion, whilst her profound respect for the sovereign made her unwilling\r\nto disturb his tranquillity.  She therefore voluntarily banished herself\r\nto an estate she possessed called Chalais, near Barbezieux, the mansion of\r\nwhich had been uninhabited nearly a century; the porter’s lodge was the\r\nonly place in a condition to receive her. From this seat she wrote to his\r\nMajesty, explaining her motives for leaving Court; and she remained there\r\nseveral years without visiting Paris.  Louis XV. was speedily attracted by\r\nother objects, and regained the composure to which Madame de Perigord had\r\nthought it her duty to sacrifice so much.  Some years after, Mesdames’\r\nlady of honour died. Many great families solicited the place.  The King,\r\nwithout answering any of their applications, wrote to the Comtesse de\r\nPerigord: ‘My daughters have just lost their lady of honour; this place,\r\nmadame, is your due, as much on account of your personal qualities as of\r\nthe illustrious name of your family.’\r\n\r\n“Three young men of the college of St. Germain, who had just completed\r\ntheir course of studies, knowing no person about the Court, and having\r\nheard that strangers were always well treated there, resolved to dress\r\nthemselves completely in the Armenian costume, and, thus clad, to present\r\nthemselves to see the grand ceremony of the reception of several knights\r\nof the Order of the Holy Ghost.  Their stratagem met with all the success\r\nwith which they had flattered themselves.  While the procession was\r\npassing through the long mirror gallery, the Swiss of the apartments\r\nplaced them in the first row of spectators, recommending every one to pay\r\nall possible attention to the strangers.  The latter, however, were\r\nimprudent enough to enter the ‘oeil-de-boeuf’ chamber, where, were\r\nMessieurs Cardonne and Ruffin, interpreters of Oriental languages, and the\r\nfirst clerk of the consul’s department, whose business it was to attend to\r\neverything which related to the natives of the East who were in France.\r\nThe three scholars were immediately surrounded and questioned by these\r\ngentlemen, at first in modern Greek.  Without being disconcerted, they\r\nmade signs that they did not understand it.  They were then addressed in\r\nTurkish and Arabic; at length one of the interpreters, losing all\r\npatience, exclaimed, ‘Gentlemen, you certainly must understand some of the\r\nlanguages in which you have been addressed.  What country can you possibly\r\ncome from then?’--‘From St. Germain-en-Laye, sir,’ replied the boldest\r\namong them; ‘this is the first time you have put the question to us in\r\nFrench.’  They then confessed the motive of their disguise; the eldest of\r\nthem was not more than eighteen years of age.  Louis XV. was informed of\r\nthe affair.  He laughed heartily, ordered them a few hours’ confinement\r\nand a good admonition, after which they were to be set at liberty.\r\n\r\n“Louis XV. liked to talk about death, though he was extremely apprehensive\r\nof it; but his excellent health and his royal dignity probably made him\r\nimagine himself invulnerable.  He often said to people who had very bad\r\ncolds, ‘You’ve a churchyard cough there.’  Hunting one day in the forest\r\nof Senard, in a year in which bread was extremely dear, he met a man on\r\nhorseback carrying a coffin.  ‘Whither are you carrying that coffin?’--‘To\r\nthe village of ------,’ answered the peasant.  ‘Is it for a man or a\r\nwoman?’--‘For a man.’--‘What did he die of?’--‘Of hunger,’ bluntly replied\r\nthe villager.  The King spurred on his horse, and asked no more questions.\r\n\r\n“Weak as Louis XV. was, the Parliaments would never have obtained his\r\nconsent to the convocation of the States General.  I heard an anecdote on\r\nthis subject from two officers attached to that Prince’s household.  It\r\nwas at the period when the remonstrances of the Parliaments, and the\r\nrefusals to register the decrees for levying taxes, produced alarm with\r\nrespect to the state of the finances.  This became the subject of\r\nconversation one evening at the coucher of Louis XV.  ‘You will see,\r\nSire,’ said a courtier, whose office placed him in close communication\r\nwith the King, ‘that all this will make it absolutely necessary to\r\nassemble the States General!’\r\n\r\n“The King, roused by this speech from the habitual apathy of his\r\ncharacter, seized the courtier by the arm, and said to him, in a passion,\r\n‘Never repeat, these words.  I am not sanguinary; but had I a brother, and\r\nwere he to dare to give me such advice, I would sacrifice him, within\r\ntwenty-four hours, to the duration of the monarchy and the tranquillity of\r\nthe kingdom.’\r\n\r\n“Several years prior to his death the Dauphin, the father of Louis XVI.,\r\nhad confluent smallpox, which endangered his life; and after his\r\nconvalescence he was long troubled with a malignant ulcer under the nose.\r\nHe was injudiciously advised to get rid of it by the use of extract of\r\nlead, which proved effectual; but from that time the Dauphin, who was\r\ncorpulent, insensibly grew thin, and a short, dry cough evinced that the\r\nhumour, driven in, had fallen on the lungs.  Some persons also suspected\r\nhim of having taken acids in too great a quantity for the purpose of\r\nreducing his bulk.  The state of his health was not, however, such as to\r\nexcite alarm.  At the camp at Compiegne, in July, 1764, the Dauphin\r\nreviewed the troops, and evinced much activity in the performance of his\r\nduties; it was even observed that he was seeking to gain the attachment of\r\nthe army.  He presented the Dauphiness to the soldiers, saying, with a\r\nsimplicity which at that time made a great sensation, ‘Mes enfans, here is\r\nmy wife.’  Returning late on horseback to Compiegne, he found he had taken\r\na chill; the heat of the day had been excessive; the Prince’s clothes had\r\nbeen wet with perspiration.  An illness followed, in which the Prince\r\nbegan to spit blood.  His principal physician wished to have him bled; the\r\nconsulting physicians insisted on purgation, and their advice was\r\nfollowed.  The pleurisy, being ill cured, assumed and retained all the\r\nsymptoms of consumption; the Dauphin languished from that period until\r\nDecember, 1765, and died at Fontainebleau, where the Court, on account of\r\nhis condition, had prolonged its stay, which usually ended on the 2d of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n“The Dauphiness, his widow, was deeply afflicted; but the immoderate\r\ndespair which characterised her grief induced many to suspect that the\r\nloss of the crown was an important part of the calamity she lamented. She\r\nlong refused to eat enough to support life; she encouraged her tears to\r\nflow by placing portraits of the Dauphin in every retired part of her\r\napartments.  She had him represented pale, and ready to expire, in a\r\npicture placed at the foot of her bed, under draperies of gray cloth, with\r\nwhich the chambers of the Princesses were always hung in court mournings.\r\nTheir grand cabinet was hung with black cloth, with an alcove, a canopy,\r\nand a throne, on which they received compliments of condolence after the\r\nfirst period of the deep mourning.  The Dauphiness, some months before the\r\nend of her career, regretted her conduct in abridging it; but it was too\r\nlate; the fatal blow had been struck.  It may also be presumed that living\r\nwith a consumptive, man had contributed to her complaint.  This Princess\r\nhad no opportunity of displaying her qualities; living in a Court in which\r\nshe was eclipsed by the King and Queen, the only characteristics that\r\ncould be remarked in her were her extreme attachment to her husband, and\r\nher great piety.\r\n\r\n“The Dauphin was little known, and his character has been much mistaken.\r\nHe himself, as he confessed to his intimate friends, sought to disguise\r\nit.  He one day asked one of his most familiar servants, ‘What do they say\r\nin Paris of that great fool of a Dauphin?’ The person interrogated seeming\r\nconfused, the Dauphin urged him to express himself sincerely, saying,\r\n‘Speak freely; that is positively the idea which I wish people to form of\r\nme.’\r\n\r\n“As he died of a disease which allows the last moment to be anticipated\r\nlong beforehand, he wrote much, and transmitted his affections and his\r\nprejudices to his son by secret notes.\r\n\r\n“Madame de Pompadour’s brother received Letters of Nobility from his\r\nMajesty, and was appointed superintendent of the buildings and gardens. He\r\noften presented to her Majesty, through the medium of his sister, the\r\nrarest flowers, pineapples, and early vegetables from the gardens of\r\nTrianon and Choisy.  One day, when the Marquise came into the Queen’s\r\napartments, carrying a large basket of flowers, which she held in her two\r\nbeautiful arms, without gloves, as a mark of respect, the Queen loudly\r\ndeclared her admiration of her beauty; and seemed as if she wished to\r\ndefend the King’s choice, by praising her various charms in detail, in a\r\nmanner that would have been as suitable to a production of the fine arts\r\nas to a living being.  After applauding the complexion, eyes, and fine\r\narms of the favourite, with that haughty condescension which renders\r\napprobation more offensive than flattering, the Queen at length requested\r\nher to sing, in the attitude in which she stood, being desirous of hearing\r\nthe voice and musical talent by which the King’s Court had been charmed in\r\nthe performances of the private apartments, and thus combining the\r\ngratification of the ears with that of the eyes.  The Marquise, who still\r\nheld her enormous basket, was perfectly sensible of something offensive in\r\nthis request, and tried to excuse herself from singing.  The Queen at last\r\ncommanded her; she then exerted her fine voice in the solo of Armida--‘At\r\nlength he is in my power.’ The change in her Majesty’s countenance was so\r\nobvious that the ladies present at this scene had the greatest difficulty\r\nto keep theirs.\r\n\r\n“The Queen was affable and modest; but the more she was thankful in her\r\nheart to Heaven for having placed her on the first throne in Europe, the\r\nmore unwilling she was to be reminded of her elevation.  This sentiment\r\ninduced her to insist on the observation of all the forms of respect due\r\nto royal birth; whereas in other princes the consciousness of that birth\r\noften induces them to disdain the ceremonies of etiquette, and to prefer\r\nhabits of ease and simplicity.  There was a striking contrast in this\r\nrespect between Maria Leczinska and Marie Antoinette, as has been justly\r\nand generally observed.  The latter unfortunate Queen, perhaps, carried\r\nher disregard of everything belonging to the strict forms of etiquette too\r\nfar.  One day, when the Marechale de Mouchy was teasing her with questions\r\nrelative to the extent to which she would allow the ladies the option of\r\ntaking off or wearing their cloaks, and of pinning up the lappets of their\r\ncaps, or letting them hang down, the Queen replied to her, in my presence:\r\n‘Arrange all those matters, madame, just as you please; but do not imagine\r\nthat a queen, born Archduchess of Austria, can attach that importance to\r\nthem which might be felt by a Polish princess who had become Queen of\r\nFrance.’\r\n\r\n“The virtues and information of the great are always evinced by their\r\nconduct; their accomplishments, coming within the scope of flattery, are\r\ndifficult to be ascertained by any authentic proofs, and those who have\r\nlived near them may be excused for some degree of scepticism with regard\r\nto their attainments of this kind.  If they draw or paint, there is always\r\nan able artist present, who, if he does not absolutely guide the pencil\r\nwith his own hand, directs it by his advice.  If a princess attempt a\r\npiece of embroidery in colours, of that description which ranks amongst\r\nthe productions of the arts, a skilful embroideress is employed to undo\r\nand repair whatever has been spoilt.  If the princess be a musician, there\r\nare no ears that will discover when she is out of tune; at least there is\r\nno tongue that will tell her so.  This imperfection in the accomplishments\r\nof the great is but a slight misfortune.  It is sufficiently meritorious\r\nin them to engage in such pursuits, even with indifferent success, because\r\nthis taste and the protection it extends produce abundance of talent on\r\nevery side.  Maria Leczinska delighted in the art of painting, and\r\nimagined she herself could draw and paint.  She had a drawing-master, who\r\npassed all his time in her cabinet.  She undertook to paint four large\r\nChinese pictures, with which she wished to ornament her private\r\ndrawing-room, which was richly furnished with rare porcelain and the\r\nfinest marbles.  This painter was entrusted with the landscape and\r\nbackground of the pictures; he drew the figures with a pencil; the faces\r\nand arms were also left by the Queen to his execution; she reserved to\r\nherself nothing but the draperies, and the least important accessories.\r\nThe Queen every morning filled up the outline marked out for her, with a\r\nlittle red, blue, or green colour, which the master prepared on the\r\npalette, and even filled her brush with, constantly repeating, ‘Higher up,\r\nMadame--lower down, Madame--a little to the right--more to the left.’\r\nAfter an hour’s work, the time for hearing mass, or some other family or\r\npious duty, would interrupt her Majesty; and the painter, putting the\r\nshadows into the draperies she had painted, softening off the colour where\r\nshe had laid too much, etc., finished the small figures.  When the work\r\nwas completed the private drawing-room was decorated with her Majesty’s\r\nwork; and the firm persuasion of this good Queen that she had painted it\r\nherself was so entire that she left this cabinet, with all its furniture\r\nand paintings, to the Comtesse de Noailles, her lady of honour.  She added\r\nto the bequest: ‘The pictures in my cabinet being my own work, I hope the\r\nComtesse de Noailles will preserve them for my sake.’  Madame de Noailles,\r\nafterwards Marechale de Mouchy, had a new pavilion constructed in her\r\nhotel in the Faubourg St. Germain, in order to form a suitable receptacle\r\nfor the Queen’s legacy; and had the following inscription placed over the\r\ndoor, in letters of gold: ‘The innocent falsehood of a good princess.’\r\n\r\n“Maria Leczinska could never look with cordiality on the Princess of\r\nSaxony, who married the Dauphin; but the attentive behaviour of the\r\nDauphiness at length made her Majesty forget that the Princess was the\r\ndaughter of a king who wore her father’s crown.  Nevertheless, although\r\nthe Queen now saw in the Princess of Saxony only a wife beloved by her\r\nson, she never could forget that Augustus wore the crown of Stanislaus.\r\nOne day an officer of her chamber having undertaken to ask a private\r\naudience of her for the Saxon minister, and the Queen being unwilling to\r\ngrant it, he ventured to add that he should not have presumed to ask this\r\nfavour of the Queen had not the minister been the ambassador of a member\r\nof the family.  ‘Say of an enemy of the family,’ replied the Queen,\r\nangrily; ‘and let him come in.’\r\n\r\n“Comte de Tesse, father of the last Count of that name, who left no\r\nchildren, was first equerry to Queen Maria Leczinska.  She esteemed his\r\nvirtues, but often diverted herself at the expense of his simplicity. One\r\nday, when the conversation turned on the noble military, actions by which\r\nthe French nobility was distinguished, the Queen said to the Count: ‘And\r\nyour family, M. de Tesse, has been famous, too, in the field.’--‘Ah,\r\nMadame, we have all been killed in our masters’ service!’--‘How rejoiced I\r\nam,’ replied the Queen, ‘that you have revived to tell me of it.’  The son\r\nof this worthy M. de Tesse was married to the amiable and highly gifted\r\ndaughter of the Duc d’Ayen, afterwards Marechale de Noailles.  He was\r\nexceedingly fond of his daughter-in-law, and never could speak of her\r\nwithout emotion.  The Queen, to please him, often talked to him about the\r\nyoung Countess, and one day asked him which of her good qualities seemed\r\nto him most conspicuous.  ‘Her gentleness, Madame, her gentleness,’ said\r\nhe, with tears in his eyes; ‘she is so mild, so soft,--as soft as a good\r\ncarriage.’--‘Well,’ said her Majesty, ‘that’s an excellent comparison for\r\na first equerry.’\r\n\r\n“In 1730 Queen Maria Leczinska, going to mass, met old Marechal Villars,\r\nleaning on a wooden crutch not worth fifteen pence.  She rallied him about\r\nit, and the Marshal told her that he had used it ever since he had\r\nreceived a wound which obliged him to add this article to the equipments\r\nof the army.  Her Majesty, smiling, said she thought this crutch so\r\nunworthy of him that she hoped to induce him to give it up.  On returning\r\nhome she despatched M. Campan to Paris with orders to purchase at the\r\ncelebrated Germain’s the handsomest cane, with a gold enamelled crutch,\r\nthat he could find, and carry it without delay to Marechal Villars’s\r\nhotel, and present it to him from her.  He was announced accordingly, and\r\nfulfilled his commission.  The Marshal, in attending him to the door,\r\nrequested him to express his gratitude to the Queen, and said that he had\r\nnothing fit to offer to an officer who had the honour to belong to her\r\nMajesty; but he begged him to accept of his old stick, saying that his\r\ngrandchildren would probably some day be glad to possess the cane with\r\nwhich he had commanded at Marchiennes and Denain.  The known frugality of\r\nMarechal Villars appears in this anecdote; but he was not mistaken with\r\nrespect to the estimation in which his stick would be held.  It was\r\nthenceforth kept with veneration by M. Campan’s family.  On the 10th of\r\nAugust, 1792, a house which I occupied on the Carrousel, at the entrance\r\nof the Court of the Tuileries, was pillaged and nearly burnt down.  The\r\ncane of Marechal Villars was thrown into the Carrousel as of no value, and\r\npicked up by my servant.  Had its old master been living at that period we\r\nshould not have witnessed such a deplorable day.\r\n\r\n“Before the Revolution there were customs and words in use at Versailles\r\nwith which few people were acquainted.  The King’s dinner was called ‘The\r\nKing’s meat.’  Two of the Body Guard accompanied the attendants who\r\ncarried the dinner; every one rose as they passed through the halls,\r\nsaying, ‘There is the King’s meat.’  All precautionary duties were\r\ndistinguished by the words ‘in case.’  One of the guards might be heard to\r\nsay, ‘I am in case in the forest of St. Germain.’  In the evening they\r\nalways brought the Queen a large bowl of broth, a cold roast fowl, one\r\nbottle of wine, one of orgeat, one of lemonade, and some other articles,\r\nwhich were called the ‘in case’ for the night.  An old medical gentleman,\r\nwho had been physician in ordinary to Louis XIV., and was still living at\r\nthe time of the marriage of Louis XV., told M. Campan’s father an anecdote\r\nwhich seems too remarkable to have remained unknown; nevertheless he was a\r\nman of honour, incapable of inventing this story. His name was Lafosse.\r\nHe said that Louis XIV. was informed that the officers of his table\r\nevinced, in the most disdainful and offensive manner, the mortification\r\nthey felt at being obliged to eat at the table of the comptroller of the\r\nkitchen along with Moliere, valet de chambre to his Majesty, because\r\nMoliere had performed on the stage; and that this celebrated author\r\nconsequently declined appearing at that table.  Louis XIV., determined to\r\nput an end to insults which ought never to have been offered to one of the\r\ngreatest geniuses of the age, said to him one morning at the hour of his\r\nprivate levee, ‘They say you live very poorly here, Moliere; and that the\r\nofficers of my chamber do not find you good enough to eat with them.\r\nPerhaps you are hungry; for my part I awoke with a very good appetite this\r\nmorning: sit down at this table.  Serve up my ‘in case’ for the night\r\nthere.’  The King, then cutting up his fowl, and ordering Moliere to sit\r\ndown, helped him to a wing, at the same time taking one for himself, and\r\nordered the persons entitled to familiar entrance, that is to say the most\r\ndistinguished and favourite people at Court, to be admitted.  ‘You see\r\nme,’ said the King to them, ‘engaged in entertaining Moliere, whom my\r\nvalets de chambre do not consider sufficiently good company for them.’\r\nFrom that time Moliere never had occasion to appear at the valets’ table;\r\nthe whole Court was forward enough to send him invitations.\r\n\r\n“M. de Lafosse used also to relate that a brigade-major of the Body Guard,\r\nbeing ordered to place the company in the little theatre at Versailles,\r\nvery roughly turned out one of the King’s comptrollers who had taken his\r\nseat on one of the benches, a place to which his newly acquired office\r\nentitled him.  In vain he insisted on his quality and his right.  The\r\naltercation was ended by the brigade-major in these words: ‘Gentlemen Body\r\nGuards, do your duty.’  In this case their duty was to turn the offender\r\nout at the door.  This comptroller, who had paid sixty or eighty thousand\r\nfrancs for his appointment, was a man of a good family, and had had the\r\nhonour of serving his Majesty five and twenty years in one of his\r\nregiments; thus ignominiously driven out of the hall, he placed himself in\r\nthe King’s way in the great hall of the Guards, and, bowing to his\r\nMajesty, requested him to vindicate the honour of an old soldier who had\r\nwished to end his days in his Prince’s civil employment, now that age had\r\nobliged him to relinquish his military service.  The King stopped, heard\r\nhis story, and then ordered him to follow him.  His Majesty attended the\r\nrepresentation in a sort of amphitheatre, in which his armchair was\r\nplaced; behind him was a row of stools for the captain of the Guards, the\r\nfirst gentleman of the chamber, and other great officers.  The\r\nbrigade-major was entitled to one of these places; the King stopped\r\nopposite the seat which ought to have been occupied by that officer and\r\nsaid to the comptroller, ‘Take, monsieur, for this evening, the place near\r\nmy person of him who has offended you, and let the expression of my\r\ndispleasure at this unjust affront satisfy you instead of any other\r\nreparation:\r\n\r\n“During the latter years of the reign of Louis XIV. he never went out but\r\nin a chair carried by porters, and he showed a great regard for a man\r\nnamed D’Aigremont, one of those porters who always went in front and\r\nopened the door of the chair.  The slightest preference shown by\r\nsovereigns, even to the meanest of their servants, never fails to excite\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n[People of the very first rank did not disdain to descend to the level of\r\nD’Aigremont.  “Lauzun,” said the Duchesse d’Orleans in her “Memoirs,”\r\n “sometimes affects stupidity in order to show people their own with\r\nimpunity, for he is very malicious.  In order to make Marechal de Tease\r\nfeel the impropriety of his familiarity with people of the common sort, he\r\ncalled out, in the drawing-room at Marly, ‘Marechal, give me a pinch of\r\nsnuff; some of your best, such as you take in the morning with Monsieur\r\nd’Aigremont, the chairman.’”--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThe King had done something for this man’s numerous family, and frequently\r\ntalked to him.  An abbe belonging to the chapel thought proper to request\r\nD’Aigremont to present a memorial to the King, in which he requested his\r\nMajesty to grant him a benefice.  Louis XIV.  did not approve of the\r\nliberty thus taken by his chairman, and said to him, in a very angry tone,\r\n‘D’Aigremont, you have been made to do a very unbecoming act, and I am\r\nsure there must be simony in the case.’--‘No, Sire, there is not the least\r\nceremony in the case, I assure you,’ answered the poor man, in great\r\nconsternation; ‘the abbe only said he would give me a hundred\r\nLouis.’--‘D’Aigremont,’ said the King, ‘I forgive you on account of your\r\nignorance and candour.  I will give you the hundred Louis out of my privy\r\npurse; but I will discharge you the very next time you venture to present\r\na memorial to me.’\r\n\r\n“Louis XIV. was very kind to those of his servants who were nearest his\r\nperson; but the moment he assumed his royal deportment, those who were\r\nmost accustomed to see him in his domestic character were as much\r\nintimidated as if they were appearing in his presence for the first time\r\nin their lives.  Some of the members of his Majesty’s civil household,\r\nthen called ‘commensalite’, enjoying the title of equerry, and the\r\nprivileges attached to officers of the King’s household, had occasion to\r\nclaim some prerogatives, the exercise of which the municipal body of St.\r\nGermain, where they resided, disputed with them.  Being assembled in\r\nconsiderable numbers in that town, they obtained the consent of the\r\nminister of the household to allow them to send a deputation to the King;\r\nand for that purpose chose from amongst them two of his Majesty’s valets\r\nde chambre named Bazire and Soulaigre.  The King’s levee being over, the\r\ndeputation of the inhabitants of the town of St. Germain was called in.\r\nThey entered with confidence; the King looked at them, and assumed his\r\nimposing attitude.  Bazire, one of these valets de chambre, was about to\r\nspeak, but Louis the Great was looking on him.  He no longer saw the\r\nPrince he was accustomed to attend at home; he was intimidated, and could\r\nnot find words; he recovered, however, and began as usual with the word\r\nSire.  But timidity again overpowered him, and finding himself unable to\r\nrecollect the slightest particle of what he came to say, he repeated the\r\nword Sire several times, and at length concluded by paying, ‘Sire, here is\r\nSoulaigre.’  Soulaigre, who was very angry with Bazire, and expected to\r\nacquit himself much better, then began to speak; but he also, after\r\nrepeating ‘Sire’ several times, found his embarrassment increasing upon\r\nhim, until his confusion equalled that of his colleague; he therefore\r\nended with ‘Sire, here is Bazire.’  The King smiled, and answered,\r\n‘Gentlemen, I have been informed of the business upon which you have been\r\ndeputed to wait on me, and I will take care that what is right shall be\r\ndone.  I am highly satisfied with the manner in which you have fulfilled\r\nyour functions as deputies.’”\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Genet’s education was the object of her father’s particular\r\nattention.  Her progress in the study of music and of foreign languages\r\nwas surprising; Albaneze instructed her in singing, and Goldoni taught her\r\nItalian.  Tasso, Milton, Dante, and even Shakespeare, soon became familiar\r\nto her.  But her studies were particularly directed to the acquisition of\r\na correct and elegant style of reading.  Rochon de Chabannes, Duclos,\r\nBarthe, Marmontel, and Thomas took pleasure in hearing her recite the\r\nfinest scenes of Racine.  Her memory and genius at the age of fourteen\r\ncharmed them; they talked of her talents in society, and perhaps applauded\r\nthem too highly.\r\n\r\nShe was soon spoken of at Court.  Some ladies of high rank, who took an\r\ninterest in the welfare of her family, obtained for her the place of\r\nReader to the Princesses.  Her presentation, and the circumstances which\r\npreceded it, left a strong impression on her mind.  “I was then fifteen,”\r\n she says; “my father felt some regret at yielding me up at so early an age\r\nto the jealousies of the Court.  The day on which I first put on my Court\r\ndress, and went to embrace him in his study, tears filled his eyes, and\r\nmingled with the expression of his pleasure.  I possessed some agreeable\r\ntalents, in addition to the instruction which it had been his delight to\r\nbestow on me.  He enumerated all my little accomplishments, to convince me\r\nof the vexations they would not fail to draw upon me.”\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Genet, at fifteen, was naturally less of a philosopher than\r\nher father was at forty.  Her eyes were dazzled by the splendour which\r\nglittered at Versailles.  “The Queen, Maria Leczinska, the wife of Louis\r\nXV., died,” she says, “just before I was presented at Court.  The grand\r\napartments hung with black, the great chairs of state, raised on several\r\nsteps, and surmounted by a canopy adorned with Plumes; the caparisoned\r\nhorses, the immense retinue in Court mourning, the enormous\r\nshoulder-knots, embroidered with gold and silver spangles, which decorated\r\nthe coats of the pages and footmen,--all this magnificence had such an\r\neffect on my senses that I could scarcely support myself when introduced\r\nto the Princesses.  The first day of my reading in the inner apartment of\r\nMadame Victoire I found it impossible to pronounce more than two\r\nsentences; my heart palpitated, my voice faltered, and my sight failed.\r\nHow well understood was the potent magic of the grandeur and dignity which\r\nought to surround sovereigns!  Marie Antoinette, dressed in white, with a\r\nplain straw hat, and a little switch in her hand, walking on foot,\r\nfollowed by a single servant, through the walks leading to the Petit\r\nTrianon, would never have thus disconcerted me; and I believe this extreme\r\nsimplicity was the first and only real mistake of all those with which she\r\nis reproached.”\r\n\r\nWhen once her awe and confusion had subsided, Mademoiselle Genet was\r\nenabled to form a more accurate judgment of her situation.  It was by no\r\nmeans attractive; the Court of the Princesses, far removed from the revels\r\nto which Louie XV. was addicted, was grave, methodical, and dull. Madame\r\nAdelaide, the eldest of the Princesses, lived secluded in the interior of\r\nher apartments; Madame Sophie was haughty; Madame Louise a devotee.\r\nMademoiselle Genet never quitted the Princesses’ apartments; but she\r\nattached herself most particularly to Madame Victoire.  This Princess had\r\npossessed beauty; her countenance bore an expression of benevolence, and\r\nher conversation was kind, free, and unaffected.  The young reader excited\r\nin her that feeling which a woman in years, of an affectionate\r\ndisposition, readily extends to young people who are growing up in her\r\nsight, and who possess some useful talents.  Whole days were passed in\r\nreading to the Princess, as she sat at work in her apartment. Mademoiselle\r\nGenet frequently saw there Louis XV., of whom she has related the\r\nfollowing anecdote:\r\n\r\n“One day, at the Chateau of Compiegne, the King came in whilst I was\r\nreading to Madame.  I rose and went into another room.  Alone, in an\r\napartment from which there was no outlet, with no book but a Massillon,\r\nwhich I had been reading to the Princess, happy in all the lightness and\r\ngaiety of fifteen, I amused myself with turning swiftly round, with my\r\ncourt hoop, and suddenly kneeling down to see my rose-coloured silk\r\npetticoat swelled around me by the wind.  In the midst of this grave\r\nemployment enters his Majesty, followed by one of the Princesses.  I\r\nattempt to rise; my feet stumble, and down I fall in the midst of my\r\nrobes, puffed out by the wind.  ‘Daughter,’ said Louis XV., laughing\r\nheartily, ‘I advise you to send back to school a reader who makes\r\ncheeses.’”  The railleries of Louis XV. were often much more cutting, as\r\nMademoiselle Genet experienced on another occasion, which, thirty years\r\nafterwards, she could not relate without an emotion of fear. “Louis XV.,”\r\n she said, “had the most imposing presence.  His eyes remained fixed upon\r\nyou all the time he was speaking; and, notwithstanding the beauty of his\r\nfeatures, he inspired a sort of fear. I was very young, it is true, when\r\nhe first spoke to me; you shall judge whether it was in a very gracious\r\nmanner.  I was fifteen.  The King was going out to hunt, and a numerous\r\nretinue followed him.  As he stopped opposite me he said, ‘Mademoiselle\r\nGenet, I am assured you are very learned, and understand four or five\r\nforeign languages.’--‘I know only two, Sire,’ I answered, trembling.\r\n‘Which are they?’ English and Italian.’--‘Do you speak them fluently?’\r\nYes, Sire, very fluently.’ ‘That is quite enough to drive a husband mad.’\r\nAfter this pretty compliment the King went on; the retinue saluted me,\r\nlaughing; and, for my part, I remained for some moments motionless with\r\nsurprise and confusion.”\r\n\r\nAt the time when the French alliance was proposed by the Duc de Choiseul\r\nthere was at Vienna a doctor named Gassner,--[Jean Joseph Gassner, a\r\npretender to miraculous powers.]--who had fled thither to seek an asylum\r\nagainst the persecutions of his sovereign, one of the ecclesiastical\r\nelectors.  Gassner, gifted with an extraordinary warmth of imagination,\r\nimagined that he received inspirations.  The Empress protected him, saw\r\nhim occasionally, rallied him on his visions, and, nevertheless, heard\r\nthem with a sort of interest.  “Tell me,”--said she to him one day,\r\n“whether my Antoinette will be happy.”  Gassner turned pale, and remained\r\nsilent.  Being still pressed by the Empress, and wishing to give a general\r\nexpression to the idea with which he seemed deeply occupied, “Madame,” he\r\nreplied, “there are crosses for all shoulders.”\r\n\r\nThe occurrences at the Place Louis XV. on the marriage festivities at\r\nParis are generally known.  The conflagration of the scaffolds intended\r\nfor the fireworks, the want of foresight of the authorities, the avidity\r\nof robbers, the murderous career of the coaches, brought about and\r\naggravated the disasters of that day; and the young Dauphiness, coming\r\nfrom Versailles, by the Cours la Reine, elated with joy, brilliantly\r\ndecorated, and eager to witness the rejoicings of the whole people, fled,\r\nstruck with consternation and drowned in tears, from the dreadful scene.\r\nThis tragic opening of the young Princess’s life in France seemed to bear\r\nout Gassner’s hint of disaster, and to be ominous of the terrible future\r\nwhich awaited her.\r\n\r\nIn the same year in which Marie Antoinette was married to the Dauphin,\r\nHenriette Genet married a son of M. Campan, already mentioned as holding\r\nan office at the Court; and when the household of the Dauphiness was\r\nformed, Madame Campan was appointed her reader, and received from Marie\r\nAntoinette a consistent kindness and confidence to which by her loyal\r\nservice she was fully entitled.   Madame Campan’s intelligence and\r\nvivacity made her much more sympathetic to a young princess, gay and\r\naffectionate in disposition, and reared in the simplicity of a German\r\nCourt, than her lady of honour, the Comtesse de Noailles.  This\r\nrespectable lady, who was placed near her as a minister of the laws of\r\netiquette, instead of alleviating their weight, rendered their yoke\r\nintolerable to her.\r\n\r\n“Madame de Noailles,” says Madame Campan, “abounded in virtues.  Her\r\npiety, charity, and irreproachable morals rendered her worthy of praise;\r\nbut etiquette was to her a sort of atmosphere; at the slightest\r\nderangement of the consecrated order, one would have thought the\r\nprinciples of life would forsake her frame.\r\n\r\n“One day I unintentionally threw this poor lady into a terrible agony. The\r\nQueen was receiving I know not whom,--some persons just presented, I\r\nbelieve; the lady of honour, the Queen’s tirewoman, and the ladies of the\r\nbedchamber, were behind the Queen.  I was near the throne, with the two\r\nwomen on duty.  All was right,--at least I thought so.  Suddenly I\r\nperceived the eyes of Madame de Noailles fixed on mine.  She made a sign\r\nwith her head, and then raised her eyebrows to the top of her forehead,\r\nlowered them, raised them again, then began to make little signs with her\r\nhand.  From all this pantomime, I could easily perceive that something was\r\nnot as it should be; and as I looked about on all sides to find out what\r\nit was, the agitation of the Countess kept increasing.  The Queen, who\r\nperceived all this, looked at me with a smile; I found means to approach\r\nher Majesty, who said to me in a whisper, ‘Let down your lappets, or the\r\nCountess will expire.’  All this bustle arose from two unlucky pins which\r\nfastened up my lappets, whilst the etiquette of costume said ‘Lappets\r\nhanging down.’”\r\n\r\nHer contempt of the vanities of etiquette became the pretext for the first\r\nreproaches levelled at the Queen.  What misconduct might not be dreaded\r\nfrom a princess who could absolutely go out without a hoop! and who, in\r\nthe salons of Trianon, instead of discussing the important rights to\r\nchairs and stools, good-naturedly invited everybody to be seated.\r\n\r\n[M. de Fresne Forget, being one day in company with the Queen Marguerite,\r\ntold her he was astonished how men and women with such great ruffs could\r\neat soup without spoiling them; and still more how the ladies could be\r\ngallant with their great fardingales.  The Queen made no answer at that\r\ntime, but a few days after, having a very large ruff on, and some ‘bouili’\r\nto eat, she ordered a very long spoon to be brought, and ate her ‘bouili’\r\nwith it, without soiling her ruff.  Upon which, addressing herself to M.\r\nde Fresne, she said, laughing, “There now, you see, with a little\r\ningenuity one may manage anything.”--“Yes, faith, madame,” said the good\r\nman, “as far as regards the soup I am satisfied.”--LAPLACE’s “Collection,”\r\n vol. ii., p. 350.]\r\n\r\nThe anti-Austrian party, discontented and vindictive, became spies upon\r\nher conduct, exaggerated her slightest errors, and calumniated her most\r\ninnocent proceedings.  “What seems unaccountable at the first glance,”\r\n says Montjoie, “is that the first attack on the reputation of the Queen\r\nproceeded from the bosom of the Court.  What interest could the courtiers\r\nhave in seeking her destruction, which involved that of the King?  Was it\r\nnot drying up the source of all the advantages they enjoyed, or could hope\r\nfor?”\r\n\r\n[Madame Campan relates the following among many anecdotes illustrative of\r\nthe Queen’s kindness of heart: “A petition was addressed to the Queen by a\r\ncorporation in the neighbourhood of Paris, praying for the destruction of\r\nthe game which destroyed their crops.  I was the bearer of this petition\r\nto her Majesty, who said, ‘I will undertake to have these good people\r\nrelieved from so great an annoyance.’  She gave the document to M. de\r\nVermond in my presence, saying, ‘I desire that immediate justice be done\r\nto this petition.’  An assurance was given that her order should be\r\nattended to, but six weeks afterwards a second petition was sent up, for\r\nthe nuisance had not been abated after all.  If the second petition had\r\nreached the Queen, M. de Vermond would have received a sharp reprimand.\r\nShe was always so happy when it was in her power to do good.”\r\n\r\nThe quick repartee, which was another of the Queen’s characteristics, was\r\nless likely to promote her popularity.  “M. Brunier,” says Madame Campan,\r\n“was physician to the royal children. During his visits to the palace, if\r\nthe death of any of his patients was alluded to, he never failed to say,\r\n‘Ah! there I lost one of my best friends!  ‘Well,’ said the Queen, ‘if he\r\nloses all his patients who are his friends, what will become of those who\r\nare not?’”]\r\n\r\nWhen the terrible Danton exclaimed, “The kings of Europe menace us; it\r\nbehooves us to defy them; let us throw down to them the head of a king as\r\nour gage!” these detestable words, followed by so cruel a result, formed,\r\nhowever, a formidable stroke of policy.  But the Queen!  What urgent\r\nreasons of state could Danton, Collot d’Herbois, and Robespierre allege\r\nagainst her?  What savage greatness did they discover in stirring up a\r\nwhole nation to avenge their quarrel on a woman?  What remained of her\r\nformer power?  She was a captive, a widow, trembling for her children! In\r\nthose judges, who at once outraged modesty and nature; in that people\r\nwhose vilest scoffs pursued her to the scaffold, who could have recognised\r\nthe generous people of France?  Of all the crimes which disgraced the\r\nRevolution, none was more calculated to show how the spirit of party can\r\ndegrade the character of a nation.\r\n\r\nThe news of this dreadful event reached Madame Campan in an obscure\r\nretreat which she had chosen.  She had not succeeded in her endeavours to\r\nshare the Queen’s captivity, and she expected every moment a similar fate.\r\nAfter escaping, almost miraculously, from the murderous fury of the\r\nMarseillais; after being denounced and pursued by Robespierre, and\r\nentrusted, through the confidence of the King and Queen, with papers of\r\nthe utmost importance, Madame Campan went to Coubertin, in the valley of\r\nChevreuse.  Madame Auguid, her sister, had just committed suicide, at the\r\nvery moment of her arrest.\r\n\r\n[Maternal affection prevailed over her religious sentiments; she wished to\r\npreserve the wreck of her fortune for her children.  Had she deferred this\r\nfatal act for one day she would have been saved; the cart which conveyed\r\nRobespierre to execution stopped her funeral procession!]\r\n\r\nThe scaffold awaited Madame Campan, when the 9th of Thermidor restored her\r\nto life; but did not restore to her the most constant object of her\r\nthoughts, her zeal, and her devotion.\r\n\r\nA new career now opened to Madame Campan.  At Coubertin, surrounded by her\r\nnieces, she was fond of directing their studies.  This occupation caused\r\nher ideas to revert to the subject of education, and awakened once more\r\nthe inclinations of her youth.  At the age of twelve years she could never\r\nmeet a school of young ladies passing through the streets without feeling\r\nambitious of the situation and authority of their mistress.  Her abode at\r\nCourt had diverted but not altered her inclinations.  “A month after the\r\nfall of Robespierre,” she says, “I considered as to the means of providing\r\nfor myself, for a mother seventy years of age, my sick husband, my child\r\nnine years old, and part of my ruined family.  I now possessed nothing in\r\nthe world but an assignat of five hundred francs. I had become responsible\r\nfor my husband’s debts, to the amount of thirty thousand francs.  I chose\r\nSt. Germain to set up a boarding-school, for that town did not remind me,\r\nas Versailles did, both of happy times and of the misfortunes of France.\r\nI took with me a nun of l’Enfant-Jesus, to give an unquestionable pledge\r\nof my religious principles.  The school of St. Germain was the first in\r\nwhich the opening of an oratory was ventured on.  The Directory was\r\ndispleased at it, and ordered it to be immediately shut up; and some time\r\nafter commissioners were sent to desire that the reading of the Scriptures\r\nshould be suppressed in my school.  I inquired what books were to be\r\nsubstituted in their stead.  After some minutes’ conversation, they\r\nobserved: ‘Citizeness, you are arguing after the old fashion; no\r\nreflections.  The nation commands; we must have obedience, and no\r\nreasoning.’  Not having the means of printing my prospectus, I wrote a\r\nhundred copies of it, and sent them to the persons of my acquaintance who\r\nhad survived the dreadful commotions.  At the year’s end I had sixty\r\npupils; soon afterwards a hundred.  I bought furniture and paid my debts.”\r\n\r\nThe rapid success of the establishment at St. Germain was undoubtedly\r\nowing to the talents, experience, and excellent principles of Madame\r\nCampan, seconded by public opinion.  All property had changed hands; all\r\nranks found themselves confusedly jumbled by the shock of the Revolution:\r\nthe grand seigneur dined at the table of the opulent contractor; and the\r\nwitty and elegant marquise was present at the ball by the side of the\r\nclumsy peasant lately grown rich.  In the absence of the ancient\r\ndistinctions, elegant manners and polished language now formed a kind of\r\naristocracy.  The house of St. Germain, conducted by a lady who possessed\r\nthe deportment and the habits of the best society, was not only a school\r\nof knowledge, but a school of the world.\r\n\r\n“A friend of Madame de Beauharnais,” continues Madame Campan, “brought me\r\nher daughter Hortense de Beauharnais, and her niece Emilie de Beauharnais.\r\nSix months afterwards she came to inform me of her marriage with a\r\nCorsican gentleman, who had been brought up in the military school, and\r\nwas then a general.  I was requested to communicate this information to\r\nher daughter, who long lamented her mother’s change of name.  I was also\r\ndesired to watch over the education of little Eugene de Beauharnais, who\r\nwas placed at St. Germain, in the same school with my son.\r\n\r\n“A great intimacy sprang up between my nieces and these young people.\r\nMadame de Beauharnaias set out for Italy, and left her children with me.\r\nOn her return, after the conquests of Bonaparte, that general, much\r\npleased with the improvement of his stepdaughter, invited me to dine at\r\nMalmaison, and attended two representations of ‘Esther’ at my school.”\r\n\r\nHe also showed his appreciation of her talents by sending his sister\r\nCaroline to St. Germain.  Shortly before Caroline’s marriage to Murat, and\r\nwhile she was yet at St. Germain, Napoleon observed to Madame Campan: “I\r\ndo not like those love matches between young people whose brains are\r\nexcited by the flames of the imagination.  I had other views for my\r\nsister.  Who knows what high alliance I might have procured for her!  She\r\nis thoughtless, and does not form a just notion of my situation.  The time\r\nwill come when, perhaps, sovereigns might dispute for her hand.  She is\r\nabout to marry a brave man; but in my situation that is not enough. Fate\r\nshould be left to fulfil her decrees.”\r\n\r\n[Madame Murat one day said to Madame Campan: “I am astonished that you are\r\nnot more awed in our presence; you speak to us with as much familiarity as\r\nwhen we were your pupils!”--“The best thing you can do,” replied Madame\r\nCampan, “is to forget your titles when you are with me, for I can never be\r\nafraid of queens whom I have held under the rod.”]\r\n\r\nMadame Campan dined at the Tuileries in company with the Pope’s nuncio, at\r\nthe period when the Concordat was in agitation.  During dinner the First\r\nConsul astonished her by the able manner in which he conversed on the\r\nsubject under discussion.  She said he argued so logically that his talent\r\nquite amazed her.  During the consulate Napoleon one day said to her, “If\r\never I establish a republic of women, I shall make you First Consul.”\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s views as to “woman’s mission” are now well known.  Madame\r\nCampan said that she heard from him that when he founded the convent of\r\nthe Sisters of la Charite he was urgently solicited to permit perpetual\r\nvows.  He, however, refused to do so, on the ground that tastes may\r\nchange, and that he did not see the necessity of excluding from the world\r\nwomen who might some time or other return to it, and become useful members\r\nof society.  “Nunneries,” he added, “assail the very roots of population.\r\nIt is impossible to calculate the loss which a nation sustains in having\r\nten thousand women shut up in cloisters.  War does but little mischief;\r\nfor the number of males is at least one-twenty-fifth greater than that of\r\nfemales.  Women may, if they please, be allowed to make perpetual vows at\r\nfifty years of age; for then their task is fulfilled.”\r\n\r\nNapoleon once said to Madame Campan, “The old systems of education were\r\ngood for nothing; what do young women stand in need of, to be well brought\r\nup in France?”--“Of mothers,” answered Madame Campan.  “It is well said,”\r\n replied Napoleon.  “Well, madame, let the French be indebted to you for\r\nbringing up mothers for their children.”--“Napoleon one day interrupted\r\nMadame de Stael in the midst of a profound political argument to ask her\r\nwhether she had nursed her children.”\r\n\r\nNever had the establishment at St. Germain been in a more flourishing\r\ncondition than in 1802-3.  What more could Madame Campan wish?  For ten\r\nyears absolute in her own house, she seemed also safe from the caprice of\r\npower.  But the man who then disposed of the fate of France and Europe was\r\nsoon to determine otherwise.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Austerlitz the State undertook to bring up, at the\r\npublic expense, the sisters, daughters, or nieces of those who were\r\ndecorated with the Cross of Honour.  The children of the warriors killed\r\nor wounded in glorious battle were to find paternal care in the ancient\r\nabodes of the Montmorencys and the Condes.  Accustomed to concentrate\r\naround him all superior talents, fearless himself of superiority, Napoleon\r\nsought for a person qualified by experience and abilities to conduct the\r\ninstitution of Ecouen; he selected Madame Campan.\r\n\r\nComte de Lacepede, the pupil, friend, and rival of Buffon, then Grand\r\nChancellor of the Legion of Honour, assisted her with his enlightened\r\nadvice.  Napoleon, who could descend with ease from the highest political\r\nsubjects to the examination of the most minute details; who was as much at\r\nhome in inspecting a boarding-school for young ladies as in reviewing the\r\ngrenadiers of his guard; whom it was impossible to deceive, and who was\r\nnot unwilling to find fault when he visited the establishment at\r\nEcouen,--was forced to say, “It is all right.”\r\n\r\n[Napoleon wished to be informed of every particular of the furniture,\r\ngovernment, and order of the house, the instruction and education of the\r\npupils.  The internal regulations were submitted to him.  One of the\r\nintended rules, drawn up by Madame Campan, proposed that the children\r\nshould hear mass on Sundays and Thursdays. Napoleon himself wrote on the\r\nmargin, “every day.”]\r\n\r\n“In the summer of 1811,” relates Madame Campan, “Napoleon, accompanied by\r\nMarie Louise and several personages of distinction, visited the\r\nestablishment at Ecouen.  After inspecting the chapel and the refectories,\r\nNapoleon desired that the three principal pupils might be presented to\r\nhim.  ‘Sire,’ said I, ‘I cannot select three; I must present six.’  He\r\nturned on his heel and repaired to the platform, where, after seeing all\r\nthe classes assembled, he repeated his demand.  ‘Sire,’ said I, ‘I beg\r\nleave to inform your Majesty that I should commit an injustice towards\r\nseveral other pupils who are as far advanced as those whom I might have\r\nthe honour to present to you.’\r\n\r\n“Berthier and others intimated to me, in a low tone of voice, that I\r\nshould get into disgrace by my noncompliance.  Napoleon looked over the\r\nwhole of the house, entered into the most trivial details, and after\r\naddressing questions to several of the pupils: ‘Well, madame,’ said he, ‘I\r\nam satisfied; show me your six best pupils.’”  Madame Campan presented\r\nthem to him; and as he stepped into his carriage, he desired that their\r\nnames might be sent to Berthier.  On addressing the list to the Prince de\r\nNeufchatel, Madame Campan added to it the names of four other pupils, and\r\nall the ten obtained a pension of 300 francs.  During the three hours\r\nwhich this visit occupied, Marie Louise did not utter a single word.\r\n\r\nM. de Beaumont, chamberlain to the Empress Josephine, one day at Malmaison\r\nwas expressing his regret that M. D-----, one of Napoleon’s generals, who\r\nhad recently been promoted, did not belong to a great family.  “You\r\nmistake, monsieur,” observed Madame Campan, “he is of very ancient\r\ndescent; he is one of the nephews of Charlemagne.  All the heroes of our\r\narmy sprang from the elder branch of that sovereign’s family, who never\r\nemigrated.”\r\n\r\nWhen Madame Campan related this circumstance she added: “After the 30th of\r\nMarch, 1814, some officers of the army of Conde presumed to say to certain\r\nFrench marshals that it was a pity they were not more nobly connected.  In\r\nanswer to this, one of them said, ‘True nobility, gentlemen, consists in\r\ngiving proofs of it.  The field of honour has witnessed ours; but where\r\nare we to look for yours?  Your swords have rusted in their scabbards.\r\nOur laurels may well excite envy; we have earned them nobly, and we owe\r\nthem solely to our valour.  You have merely inherited a name.  This is the\r\ndistinction between us.”\r\n\r\n[When one of the princes of the smaller German States was showing Marechal\r\nLannes, with a contemptuous superiority of manner but ill concealed, the\r\nportraits of his ancestors, and covertly alluding to the absence of\r\nLannes’s, that general turned the tables on him by haughtily remarking,\r\n“But I am an ancestor.”]\r\n\r\nNapoleon used to observe that if he had had two such field-marshals as\r\nSuchet in Spain he would have not only conquered but kept the Peninsula.\r\nSuchet’s sound judgment, his governing yet conciliating spirit, his\r\nmilitary tact, and his bravery, had procured him astonishing success. “It\r\nis to be regretted,” added he, “that a sovereign cannot improvise men of\r\nhis stamp.”\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of March, 1815, a number of papers were left in the King’s\r\ncloset.  Napoleon ordered them to be examined, and among them was found\r\nthe letter written by Madame Campan to Louis XVIII., immediately after the\r\nfirst restoration.  In this letter she enumerated the contents of the\r\nportfolio which Louis XVI. had placed under her care.  When Napoleon read\r\nthis letter, he said, “Let it be sent to the office of Foreign Affairs; it\r\nis an historical document.”\r\n\r\nMadame Campan thus described a visit from the Czar of Russia: “A few days\r\nafter the battle of Paris the Emperor Alexander came to Ecouen, and he did\r\nme the honour to breakfast with me.  After showing him over the\r\nestablishment I conducted him to the park, the most elevated point of\r\nwhich overlooked the plain of St. Denis.  ‘Sire,’ said I, ‘from this point\r\nI saw the battle of Paris’--‘If,’ replied the Emperor, ‘that battle had\r\nlasted two hours longer we should not have had a single cartridge at our\r\ndisposal.  We feared that we had been betrayed; for on arriving so\r\nprecipitately before Paris all our plans were laid, and we did not expect\r\nthe firm resistance we experienced.’  I next conducted the Emperor to the\r\nchapel, and showed him the seats occupied by ‘le connetable’ (the\r\nconstable) of Montmorency, and ‘la connetable’ (the constable’s lady),\r\nwhen they went to hear mass.  ‘Barbarians like us,’ observed the Emperor,\r\n‘would say la connetable and le connetable.’\r\n\r\n“The Czar inquired into the most minute particulars respecting the\r\nestablishment of Ecouen, and I felt great pleasure in answering his\r\nquestions.  I recollect having dwelt on several points which appeared to\r\nme to be very important, and which were in their spirit hostile to\r\naristocratic principles.  For example, I informed his Majesty that the\r\ndaughters of distinguished and wealthy individuals and those of the humble\r\nand obscure mingled indiscriminately in the establishment.  ‘If,’ said I,\r\n‘I were to observe the least pretension on account of the rank or fortune\r\nof parents, I should immediately put an end to it.  The most perfect\r\nequality is preserved; distinction is awarded only to merit and industry.\r\nThe pupils are obliged to cut out and make all their own clothes.  They\r\nare taught to clean and mend lace; and two at a time, they by turns, three\r\ntimes a week, cook and distribute food to the poor of the village.  The\r\nyoung girls who have been brought up at Ecouen, or in my boarding-school\r\nat St. Germain, are thoroughly acquainted with everything relating to\r\nhousehold business, and they are grateful to me for having made that a\r\npart of their education.  In my conversations with them I have always\r\ntaught them that on domestic management depends the preservation or\r\ndissipation of their fortunes.’\r\n\r\n“The post-master of Ecouen was in the courtyard at the moment when the\r\nEmperor, as he stepped into his carriage, told me he would send some\r\nsweetmeats for the pupils.  I immediately communicated to them the\r\nintelligence, which was joyfully received; but the sweetmeats were looked\r\nfor in vain.  When Alexander set out for England he changed horses at\r\nEcouen, and the post-master said to him: ‘Sire, the pupils of Ecouen are\r\nstill expecting the sweetmeats which your Majesty promised them.’  To\r\nwhich the Emperor replied that he had directed Saken to send them.  The\r\nCossacks had most likely devoured the sweetmeats, and the poor little\r\ngirls, who had been so highly flattered by the promise, never tasted\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“A second house was formed at St. Denis, on the model of that of Ecouen.\r\nPerhaps Madame Campan might have hoped for a title to which her long\r\nlabours gave her a right; perhaps the superintendence of the two houses\r\nwould have been but the fair recompense of her services; but her fortunate\r\nyears had passed her fate was now to depend on the most important events.\r\nNapoleon had accumulated such a mass of power as no one but himself in\r\nEurope could overturn.  France, content with thirty years of victories, in\r\nvain asked for peace and repose.  The army which had triumphed in the\r\nsands of Egypt, on the summits of the Alps, and in the marshes of Holland,\r\nwas to perish amidst the snows of Russia. Nations combined against a\r\nsingle man.  The territory of France was invaded.  The orphans of Ecouen,\r\nfrom the windows of the mansion which served as their asylum, saw in the\r\ndistant plain the fires of the Russian bivouacs, and once more wept the\r\ndeaths of their fathers.  Paris capitulated.  France hailed the return of\r\nthe descendants of Henri IV.; they reascended the throne so long filled by\r\ntheir ancestors, which the wisdom of an enlightened prince established on\r\nthe empire of the laws.\r\n\r\n[A lady, connected with the establishment of St. Denis, told Madame Campan\r\nthat Napoleon visited it during the Hundred Days, and that the pupils were\r\nso delighted to see him that they crowded round him, endeavouring to touch\r\nhis clothes, and evincing the most extravagant joy.  The matron\r\nendeavoured to silence them; but Napoleon said, ‘Let them alone; let them\r\nalone.  This may weaken the head, but it strengthens the heart.’]”\r\n\r\nThis moment, which diffused joy amongst the faithful servants of the royal\r\nfamily, and brought them the rewards of their devotion, proved to Madame\r\nCampan a period of bitter vexation.  The hatred of her enemies had\r\nrevived.  The suppression of the school at Ecouen had deprived her of her\r\nposition; the most absurd calumnies followed her into her retreat; her\r\nattachment to the Queen was suspected; she was accused not only of\r\ningratitude but of perfidy.  Slander has little effect on youth, but in\r\nthe decline of life its darts are envenomed with a mortal poison.  The\r\nwounds which Madame Campan had received were deep.  Her sister, Madame\r\nAuguie, had destroyed herself; M. Rousseau, her brother-in-law, had\r\nperished, a victim of the reign of terror.  In 1813 a dreadful accident\r\nhad deprived her of her niece, Madame de Broc, one of the most amiable and\r\ninteresting beings that ever adorned the earth.  Madame Campan seemed\r\ndestined to behold those whom she loved go down to the grave before her.\r\n\r\nBeyond the walls of the mansion of Ecouen, in the village which surrounds\r\nit, Madame Campan had taken a small house where she loved to pass a few\r\nhours in solitary retirement.  There, at liberty to abandon herself to the\r\nmemory of the past, the superintendent of the imperial establishment\r\nbecame, once more, for the moment, the first lady of the chamber to Marie\r\nAntoinette.  To the few friends whom she admitted into this retreat she\r\nwould show, with emotion, a plain muslin gown which the Queen had worn,\r\nand which was made from a part of Tippoo Saib’s present.  A cup, out of\r\nwhich Marie Antoinette had drunk; a writing-stand, which she had long\r\nused, were, in her eyes, of inestimable value; and she has often been\r\ndiscovered sitting, in tears, before the portrait of her royal mistress.\r\n\r\nAfter so many troubles Madame Campan sought a peaceful retreat.  Paris had\r\nbecome odious to her.\r\n\r\nShe paid a visit to one of her most beloved pupils, Mademoiselle Crouzet,\r\nwho had married a physician at Mantes, a man of talent, distinguished for\r\nhis intelligence, frankness, and cordiality.\r\n\r\n[M. Maigne, physician to the infirmaries at Mantes.  Madame Campan found\r\nin him a friend and comforter, of whose merit and affection she knew the\r\nvalue.]\r\n\r\nMantes is a cheerful place of residence, and the idea of an abode there\r\npleased her.  A few intimate friends formed a pleasant society, and she\r\nenjoyed a little tranquillity after so many disturbances.  The revisal of\r\nher “Memoirs,” the arrangement of the interesting anecdotes of which her\r\n“Recollections” were to consist, alone diverted her mind from the one\r\npowerful sentiment which attached her to life.  She lived only for her\r\nson.  M. Campan deserved the tenderness of, his mother.  No sacrifice had\r\nbeen spared for his education.  After having pursued that course of study\r\nwhich, under the Imperial Government, produced men of such distinguished\r\nmerit, he was waiting till time and circumstances should afford him an\r\nopportunity of devoting his services to his country.  Although the state\r\nof his health was far from good, it did not threaten any rapid or\r\npremature decay; he was, however, after a few days’ illness, suddenly\r\ntaken from his family.  “I never witnessed so heartrending a scene,” M.\r\nMaigne says, “as that which took place when Marechal Ney’s lady, her\r\nniece, and Madame Pannelier, her sister, came to acquaint her with this\r\nmisfortune.--[The wife of Marechal Ney was a daughter of Madame Auguie,\r\nand had been an intimate friend of Hortense Beauharnais.]--When they\r\nentered her apartment she was in bed.  All three at once uttered a\r\npiercing cry.  The two ladies threw themselves on their knees, and kissed\r\nher hands, which they bedewed with tears.  Before they could speak to her\r\nshe read in their faces that she no longer possessed a son.  At that\r\ninstant her large eyes, opening wildly, seemed to wander.  Her face grew\r\npale, her features changed, her lips lost their colour, she struggled to\r\nspeak, but uttered only inarticulate sounds, accompanied by piercing\r\ncries.  Her gestures were wild, her reason was suspended.  Every part of\r\nher being was in agony.  To this state of anguish and despair no calm\r\nsucceeded, until her tears began to flow.  Friendship and the tenderest\r\ncares succeeded for a moment in calming her grief, but not in diminishing\r\nits power.\r\n\r\n“This violent crisis had disturbed her whole organisation.  A cruel\r\ndisorder, which required a still more cruel operation, soon manifested\r\nitself.  The presence of her family, a tour which she made in Switzerland,\r\na residence at Baden, and, above all, the sight, the tender and charming\r\nconversation of a person by whom she was affectionately beloved,\r\noccasionally diverted her mind, and in a slight degree relieved her\r\nsuffering.”  She underwent a serious operation, performed with\r\nextraordinary promptitude and the most complete success.  No unfavourable\r\nsymptoms appeared; Madame Campan was thought to be restored to her\r\nfriends; but the disorder was in the blood; it took another course: the\r\nchest became affected.  “From that moment,” says M. Maigne, “I could never\r\nlook on Madame Campan as living; she herself felt that she belonged no\r\nmore to this world.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” she said to her physician the day before her death, “I am\r\nattached to the simplicity of religion.  I hate all that savours of\r\nfanaticism.”  When her codicil was presented for her signature, her hand\r\ntrembled; “It would be a pity,” she said, “to stop when so fairly on the\r\nroad.”\r\n\r\nMadame Campan died on the 16th of March, 1822.  The cheerfulness she\r\ndisplayed throughout her malady had nothing affected in it.  Her character\r\nwas naturally powerful and elevated.  At the approach of death she evinced\r\nthe soul of a sage, without abandoning for an instant her feminine\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMOIRS OF THE COURT OF MARIE ANTOINETTE,\r\n\r\nQUEEN OF FRANCE\r\n\r\nBeing the Historic Memoirs of Madam Campan,\r\n\r\nFirst Lady in Waiting to the Queen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was fifteen years of age when I was appointed reader to Mesdames. I will\r\nbegin by describing the Court at that period.\r\n\r\nMaria Leczinska was just dead; the death of the Dauphin had preceded hers\r\nby three years; the Jesuits were suppressed, and piety was to be found at\r\nCourt only in the apartments of Mesdames.  The Duc de Choiseuil ruled.\r\n\r\nEtiquette still existed at Court with all the forms it had acquired under\r\nLouis XIV.; dignity alone was wanting.  As to gaiety, there was none.\r\nVersailles was not the place at which to seek for assemblies where French\r\nspirit and grace were displayed.  The focus of wit and intelligence was\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThe King thought of nothing but the pleasures of the chase: it might have\r\nbeen imagined that the courtiers indulged themselves in making epigrams by\r\nhearing them say seriously, on those days when the King did not hunt, “The\r\nKing does nothing to-day.”--[In sporting usance (see SOULAIRE, p. 316).]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement beforehand of his movements was also a matter of great\r\nimportance with Louis XV.  On the first day of the year he noted down in\r\nhis almanac the days of departure for Compiegne, Fontainebleau, Choisy,\r\netc.  The weightiest matters, the most serious events, never deranged this\r\ndistribution of his time.\r\n\r\nSince the death of the Marquise de Pompadour, the King had no titled\r\nmistress; he contented himself with his seraglio in the Parc-aux-Cerfs. It\r\nis well known that the monarch found the separation of Louis de Bourbon\r\nfrom the King of France the most animating feature of his royal existence.\r\n“They would have it so; they thought it for the best,” was his way of\r\nexpressing himself when the measures of his ministers were unsuccessful.\r\nThe King delighted to manage the most disgraceful points of his private\r\nexpenses himself; he one day sold to a head clerk in the War Department a\r\nhouse in which one of his mistresses had lodged; the contract ran in the\r\nname of Louis de Bourbon, and the purchaser himself took in a bag the\r\nprice of the house in gold to the King in his private closet.\r\n\r\n[Until recently little was known about the Parc-aux-Cerfs, and it was\r\nbelieved that a great number of young women had been maintained there at\r\nenormous expense.

Le Roi, given in his\r\ninteresting work, “Curiosites Historiques sur Louis XIII., Louis XIV.,\r\nLouis XV.,” etc., Paris, Plon, 1864, have thrown fresh light upon the\r\nmatter.  The result he arrives at (see page 229 of his work) is that the\r\nhouse in question (No. 4 Rue St. Mederic, on the site of the\r\nParc-aux-Cerfs, or breeding-place for deer, of Louis XIII) was very small,\r\nand could have held only one girl, the woman in charge of her, and a\r\nservant.  Most of the girls left it only when about to be confined, and it\r\nsometimes stood vacant for five or six months.  It may have been rented\r\nbefore the date of purchase, and other houses seem sometimes to have been\r\nused also; but in any case, it is evident that both the number of girls\r\nand the expense incurred have been absurdly exaggerated.  The system\r\nflourished under Madame de Pompadour, but ceased as soon as Madame du\r\nBarry obtained full power over the King, and the house was then sold to M.\r\nJ. B. Sevin for 16,000 livres, on 27th May, 1771, Louis not acting under\r\nthe name of Louis de Bourbon, but as King,--“Vente par le Roi, notre\r\nSire.”  In 1755 he had also been declared its purchaser in a similar\r\nmanner.  Thus, Madame Campan is in error in saying that the King made the\r\ncontract as Louis de Bourbon.]--[And it also possible that Madam Campan\r\nwas correct and that the house she refers to as sold for a “bag of gold”\r\n was another of the several of the seraglio establishments of Louis XV.\r\nD.W.]\r\n\r\nLouis XV. saw very little of his family.  He came every morning by a\r\nprivate staircase into the apartment of Madame Adelaide.\r\n\r\n[Louis XV. seemed to feel for Madame Adelaide the tenderness he had had\r\nfor the Duchesse de Bourgogne, his mother, who perished so suddenly, under\r\nthe eyes and almost in the arms of Louis XIV.  The birth of Madame\r\nAdelaide, 23d March, 1732, was followed by that of Madame Victoire Louise\r\nMarie Therese on the 11th May, 1733.  Louis had, besides, six daughters:\r\nMesdames Sophie and Louise, who are mentioned in this chapter; the\r\nPrincesses Marie and Felicite, who died young; Madame Henriette died at\r\nVersailles in 1752, aged twenty-four; and finally, Madame the Duchess of\r\nParma, who also died at the Court.]\r\n\r\nHe often brought and drank there coffee that he had made himself.  Madame\r\nAdelaide pulled a bell which apprised Madame Victoire of the King’s visit;\r\nMadame Victoire, on rising to go to her sister’s apartment, rang for\r\nMadame Sophie, who in her turn rang for Madame Louise.  The apartments of\r\nMesdames were of very large dimensions.  Madame Louise occupied the\r\nfarthest room.  This latter lady was deformed and very short; the poor\r\nPrincess used to run with all her might to join the daily meeting, but,\r\nhaving a number of rooms to cross, she frequently in spite of her haste,\r\nhad only just time to embrace her father before he set out for the chase.\r\n\r\nEvery evening, at six, Mesdames interrupted my reading to them to\r\naccompany the princes to Louis XV.; this visit was called the King’s\r\n‘debotter’,--[Debotter, meaning the time of unbooting.]--and was marked by\r\na kind of etiquette.  Mesdames put on an enormous hoop, which set out a\r\npetticoat ornamented with gold or embroidery; they fastened a long train\r\nround their waists, and concealed the undress of the rest of their\r\nclothing by a long cloak of black taffety which enveloped them up to the\r\nchin.  The chevaliers d’honneur, the ladies in waiting, the pages, the\r\nequerries, and the ushers bearing large flambeaux, accompanied them to the\r\nKing.  In a moment the whole palace, generally so still, was in motion;\r\nthe King kissed each Princess on the forehead, and the visit was so short\r\nthat the reading which it interrupted was frequently resumed at the end of\r\na quarter of an hour; Mesdames returned to their apartments, and untied\r\nthe strings of their petticoats and trains; they resumed their tapestry,\r\nand I my book.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer season the King sometimes came to the residence of\r\nMesdames before the hour of his ‘debotter’.  One day he found me alone in\r\nMadame Victoire’s closet, and asked me where ‘Coche’[Piggy] was; I\r\nstarted, and he repeated his question, but without being at all the more\r\nunderstood.  When the King was gone I asked Madame of whom he spoke.  She\r\ntold me that it was herself, and very coolly explained to me, that, being\r\nthe fattest of his daughters, the King had given her the familiar name of\r\n‘Coche’; that he called Madame Adelaide, ‘Logue’ [Tatters], Madame Sophie,\r\n‘Graille’[Mite], and Madame Louise, ‘Chiffie’[Rubbish].  The people of the\r\nKing’s household observed that he knew a great number of such words;\r\npossibly he had amused himself with picking them out from dictionaries.\r\nIf this style of speaking betrayed the habits and tastes of the King, his\r\nmanner savoured nothing of such vulgarity; his walk was easy and noble, he\r\nhad a dignified carriage of the head, and his aspect, with out being\r\nsevere, was imposing; he combined great politeness with a truly regal\r\ndemeanour, and gracefully saluted the humblest woman whom curiosity led\r\ninto his path.\r\n\r\nHe was very expert in a number of trifling matters which never occupy\r\nattention but when there is a lack of something better to employ it; for\r\ninstance, he would knock off the top of an egg-shell at a single stroke of\r\nhis fork; he therefore always ate eggs when he dined in public, and the\r\nParisians who came on Sundays to see the King dine, returned home less\r\nstruck with his fine figure than with the dexterity with which he broke\r\nhis eggs.\r\n\r\nRepartees of Louis XV., which marked the keenness of his wit and the\r\nelevation of his sentiments, were quoted with pleasure in the assemblies\r\nof Versailles.\r\n\r\nThis Prince was still beloved; it was wished that a style of life suitable\r\nto his age and dignity should at length supersede the errors of the past,\r\nand justify the love of his subjects.  It was painful to judge him\r\nharshly.  If he had established avowed mistresses at Court, the uniform\r\ndevotion of the Queen was blamed for it.  Mesdames were reproached for not\r\nseeking to prevent the King’s forming an intimacy with some new favourite.\r\nMadame Henriette, twin sister of the Duchess of Parma, was much regretted,\r\nfor she had considerable influence over the King’s mind, and it was\r\nremarked that if she had lived she would have been assiduous in finding\r\nhim amusements in the bosom of his family, would have followed him in his\r\nshort excursions, and would have done the honours of the ‘petits soupers’\r\nwhich he was so fond of giving in his private apartments.\r\n\r\nMesdames too much neglected the means of pleasing the wing, but the cause\r\nof that was obvious in the little attention he had paid them in their\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nIn order to console the people under their sufferings, and to shut their\r\neyes to the real depredations on the treasury, the ministers occasionally\r\npressed the most extravagant measures of reform in the King’s household,\r\nand even in his personal expenses.\r\n\r\nCardinal Fleury, who in truth had the merit of reestablishing the\r\nfinances, carried this system of economy so far as to obtain from the King\r\nthe suppression of the household of the four younger Princesses. They were\r\nbrought up as mere boarders in a convent eighty leagues distant from the\r\nCourt.  Saint Cyr would have been more suitable for the reception of the\r\nKing’s daughters; but probably the Cardinal shared some of those\r\nprejudices which will always attach to even the most useful institutions,\r\nand which, since the death of Louis XIV., had been raised against the\r\nnoble establishment of Madame de Maintenon.  Madame Louise often assured\r\nme that at twelve years of age she was not mistress of the whole alphabet,\r\nand never learnt to read fluently until after her return to Versailles.\r\n\r\nMadame Victoire attributed certain paroxysms of terror, which she was\r\nnever able to conquer, to the violent alarms she experienced at the Abbey\r\nof Fontevrault, whenever she was sent, by way of penance, to pray alone in\r\nthe vault where the sisters were interred.\r\n\r\nA gardener belonging to the abbey died raving mad.  His habitation,\r\nwithout the walls, was near a chapel of the abbey, where Mesdames were\r\ntaken to repeat the prayers for those in the agonies of death.  Their\r\nprayers were more than once interrupted by the shrieks of the dying man.\r\n\r\nWhen Mesdames, still very young, returned to Court, they enjoyed the\r\nfriendship of Monseigneur the Dauphin, and profited by his advice.  They\r\ndevoted themselves ardently to study, and gave up almost the whole of\r\ntheir time to it; they enabled themselves to write French correctly, and\r\nacquired a good knowledge of history.  Italian, English, the higher\r\nbranches of mathematics, turning and dialing, filled up in succession\r\ntheir leisure moments.  Madame Adelaide, in particular, had a most\r\ninsatiable desire to learn; she was taught to play upon all instruments,\r\nfrom the horn (will it be believed!) to the Jew’s-harp.\r\n\r\nMadame Adelaide was graced for a short time with a charming figure; but\r\nnever did beauty so quickly vanish.  Madame Victoire was handsome and very\r\ngraceful; her address, mien, and smile were in perfect accordance with the\r\ngoodness of her heart.  Madame Sophie was remarkably ugly; never did I\r\nbehold a person with so unprepossessing an appearance; she walked with the\r\ngreatest rapidity; and, in order to recognise the people who placed\r\nthemselves along her path without looking at them, she acquired the habit\r\nof leering on one side, like a hare.  This Princess was so exceedingly\r\ndiffident that a person might be with her daily for years together without\r\nhearing her utter a single word.  It was asserted, however, that she\r\ndisplayed talent, and even amiability, in the society of some favourite\r\nladies.  She taught herself a great deal, but she studied alone; the\r\npresence of a reader would have disconcerted her very much.  There were,\r\nhowever, occasions on which the Princess, generally so intractable, became\r\nall at once affable and condescending, and manifested the most\r\ncommunicative good-nature; this would happen during a storm; so great was\r\nher alarm on such an occasion that she then approached the most humble,\r\nand would ask them a thousand obliging questions; a flash of lightning\r\nmade her squeeze their hands; a peal of thunder would drive her to embrace\r\nthem, but with the return of the calm, the Princess resumed her stiffness,\r\nher reserve, and her repellent air, and passed all by without taking the\r\nslightest notice of any one, until a fresh storm restored to her at once\r\nher dread and her affability. [Which reminds one of the elder (and\r\npuritanic) Cato who said that he “embraced” his wife only when it\r\nthundered, but added that he did enjoy a good thunderstorm. D.W.]\r\n\r\nMesdames found in a beloved brother, whose rare attainments are known to\r\nall Frenchmen, a guide in everything wanting to their education.  In their\r\naugust mother, Maria Leczinska, they possessed the noblest example of\r\nevery pious and social virtue; that Princess, by her eminent qualities and\r\nher modest dignity, veiled the failings of the King, and while she lived\r\nshe preserved in the Court of Louis XV. that decorous and dignified tone\r\nwhich alone secures the respect due to power.  The Princesses, her\r\ndaughters, were worthy of her; and if a few degraded beings did aim the\r\nshafts of calumny at them, these shafts dropped harmless, warded off by\r\nthe elevation of their sentiments and the purity of their conduct.\r\n\r\nIf Mesdames had not tasked themselves with numerous occupations, they\r\nwould have been much to be pitied.  They loved walking, but could enjoy\r\nnothing beyond the public gardens of Versailles; they would have\r\ncultivated flowers, but could have no others than those in their windows.\r\n\r\nThe Marquise de Durfort, since Duchesse de Civrac, afforded to Madame\r\nVictoire agreeable society.  The Princess spent almost all her evenings\r\nwith that lady, and ended by fancying herself domiciled with her.\r\n\r\nMadame de Narbonne had, in a similar way, taken pains to make her intimate\r\nacquaintance pleasant to Madame Adelaide.\r\n\r\nMadame Louise had for many years lived in great seclusion; I read to her\r\nfive hours a day.  My voice frequently betrayed the exhaustion of my\r\nlungs; the Princess would then prepare sugared water for me, place it by\r\nme, and apologise for making me read so long, on the score of having\r\nprescribed a course of reading for herself.\r\n\r\nOne evening, while I was reading, she was informed that M. Bertin,\r\n‘ministre des parties casuelles’, desired to speak with her; she went out\r\nabruptly, returned, resumed her silks and embroidery, and made me resume\r\nmy book; when I retired she commanded me to be in her closet the next\r\nmorning at eleven o’clock.  When I got there the Princess was gone out; I\r\nlearnt that she had gone at seven in the morning to the Convent of the\r\nCarmelites of St. Denis, where she was desirous of taking the veil. I went\r\nto Madame Victoire; there I heard that the King alone had been acquainted\r\nwith Madame Louise’s project; that he had kept it faithfully secret, and\r\nthat, having long previously opposed her wish, he had only on the\r\npreceding evening sent her his consent; that she had gone alone into the\r\nconvent, where she was expected; and that a few minutes afterwards she had\r\nmade her appearance at the grating, to show to the Princesse de Guistel,\r\nwho had accompanied her to the convent gate, and to her equerry, the\r\nKing’s order to leave her in the monastery.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving the intelligence of her sister’s departure, Madame Adelaide\r\ngave way to violent paroxysms of rage, and reproached the King bitterly\r\nfor the secret, which he had thought it his duty to preserve. Madame\r\nVictoire missed the society of her favourite sister, but she shed tears in\r\nsilence only.  The first time I saw this excellent Princess after Madame\r\nLouise’s departure, I threw myself at her feet, kissed her hand, and asked\r\nher, with all the confidence of youth, whether she would quit us as Madame\r\nLouise had done.  She raised me, embraced me; and said, pointing to the\r\nlounge upon which she was extended, “Make yourself easy, my dear; I shall\r\nnever have Louise’s courage.  I love the conveniences of life too well;\r\nthis lounge is my destruction.”  As soon as I obtained permission to do\r\nso, I went to St. Denis to see my late mistress; she deigned to receive me\r\nwith her face uncovered, in her private parlour; she told me she had just\r\nleft the wash-house, and that it was her turn that day to attend to the\r\nlinen.  “I much abused your youthful lungs for two years before the\r\nexecution of my project,” added she. “I knew that here I could read none\r\nbut books tending to our salvation, and I wished to review all the\r\nhistorians that had interested me.”\r\n\r\nShe informed me that the King’s consent for her to go to St. Denis had\r\nbeen brought to her while I was reading; she prided herself, and with\r\nreason, upon having returned to her closet without the slightest mark of\r\nagitation, though she said she felt so keenly that she could scarcely\r\nregain her chair.  She added that moralists were right when they said that\r\nhappiness does not dwell in palaces; that she had proved it; and that, if\r\nI desired to be happy, she advised me to come and enjoy a retreat in which\r\nthe liveliest imagination might find full exercise in the contemplation of\r\na better world.  I had no palace, no earthly grandeur to sacrifice to God;\r\nnothing but the bosom of a united family; and it is precisely there that\r\nthe moralists whom she cited have placed true happiness.  I replied that,\r\nin private life, the absence of a beloved and cherished daughter would be\r\ntoo cruelly felt by her family. The Princess said no more on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe seclusion of Madame Louise was attributed to various motives; some\r\nwere unkind enough to suppose it to have been occasioned by her\r\nmortification at being, in point of rank, the last of the Princesses. I\r\nthink I penetrated the true cause.  Her aspirations were lofty; she loved\r\neverything sublime; often while I was reading she would interrupt me to\r\nexclaim, “That is beautiful! that is noble!”  There was but one brilliant\r\naction that she could perform,--to quit a palace for a cell, and rich\r\ngarments for a stuff gown.  She achieved it!\r\n\r\nI saw Madame Louise two or three times more at the grating.  I was\r\ninformed of her death by Louis XVI.  “My Aunt Louise,” said he to me,\r\n“your old mistress, is just dead at St.  Denis.  I have this moment\r\nreceived intelligence of it.  Her piety and resignation were admirable,\r\nand yet the delirium of my good aunt recalled to her recollection that she\r\nwas a princess, for her last words were, ‘To paradise, haste, haste, full\r\nspeed.’  No doubt she thought she was again giving orders to her equerry.”\r\n\r\n[The retirement of Madame Louise, and her removal from Court, had only\r\nserved to give her up entirely to the intrigues of the clergy. She\r\nreceived incessant visits from bishops, archbishops, and ambitious priests\r\nof every rank; she prevailed on the King, her father, to grant many\r\necclesiastical preferments, and probably looked forward to playing an\r\nimportant part when the King, weary of his licentious course of life,\r\nshould begin to think of religion. This, perhaps, might have been the case\r\nhad not a sudden and unexpected death put an end to his career.  The\r\nproject of Madame Louise fell to the ground in consequence of this event.\r\nShe remained in her convent, whence she continued to solicit favours, as I\r\nknew from the complaints of the Queen, who often said to me, “Here is\r\nanother letter from my Aunt Louise.  She is certainly the most intriguing\r\nlittle Carmelite in the kingdom.”  The Court went to visit her about three\r\ntimes a year, and I recollect that the Queen, intending to take her\r\ndaughter there, ordered me to get a doll dressed like a Carmelite for her,\r\nthat the young Princess might be accustomed, before she went into the\r\nconvent, to the habit of her aunt, the nun.--MADAME CAMPAN]\r\n\r\nMadame Victoire, good, sweet-tempered, and affable, lived with the most\r\namiable simplicity in a society wherein she was much caressed; she was\r\nadored by her household.  Without quitting Versailles, without sacrificing\r\nher easy chair, she fulfilled the duties of religion with punctuality,\r\ngave to the poor all she possessed, and strictly observed Lent and the\r\nfasts.  The table of Mesdames acquired a reputation for dishes of\r\nabstinence, spread abroad by the assiduous parasites at that of their\r\nmaitre d’hotel.  Madame Victoire was not indifferent to good living, but\r\nshe had the most religious scruples respecting dishes of which it was\r\nallowable to partake at penitential times.  I saw her one day exceedingly\r\ntormented by her doubts about a water-fowl, which was often served up to\r\nher during Lent.  The question to be determined was, whether it was\r\n‘maigre’ or ‘gras’.  She consulted a bishop, who happened to be of the\r\nparty: the prelate immediately assumed the grave attitude of a judge who\r\nis about to pronounce sentence.  He answered the Princess that, in a\r\nsimilar case of doubt, it had been resolved that after dressing the bird\r\nit should be pricked over a very cold silver dish; if the gravy of the\r\nanimal congealed within a quarter of an hour, the creature was to be\r\naccounted flesh; but if the gravy remained in an oily state, it might be\r\neaten without scruple.  Madame Victoire immediately made the experiment:\r\nthe gravy did not congeal; and this was a source of great joy to the\r\nPrincess, who was very partial to that sort of game. The abstinence which\r\nso much occupied the attention of Madame Victoire was so disagreeable to\r\nher, that she listened with impatience for the midnight hour of Holy\r\nSaturday; and then she was immediately supplied with a good dish of fowl\r\nand rice, and sundry other succulent viands. She confessed with such\r\namiable candour her taste for good cheer and the comforts of life, that it\r\nwould have been necessary to be as severe in principle as insensible to\r\nthe excellent qualities of the Princess, to consider it a crime in her.\r\n\r\nMadame Adelaide had more mind than Madame Victoire; but she was altogether\r\ndeficient in that kindness which alone creates affection for the great,\r\nabrupt manners, a harsh voice, and a short way of speaking, rendering her\r\nmore than imposing.  She carried the idea of the prerogative of rank to a\r\nhigh pitch.  One of her chaplains was unlucky enough to say ‘Dominus\r\nvobiscum’ with rather too easy an air; the Princess rated him soundly for\r\nit after mass, and told him to remember that he was not a bishop, and not\r\nagain to think of officiating in the style of a prelate.\r\n\r\nMesdames lived quite separate from the King.  Since the death of Madame de\r\nPompadour he had lived alone.  The enemies of the Duc de Choiseul did not\r\nknow in what department, nor through what channel, they could prepare and\r\nbring about the downfall of the man who stood in their way.  The King was\r\nconnected only with women of so low a class that they could not be made\r\nuse of for any delicate intrigue; moreover, the Parc-aux-Cerfs was a\r\nseraglio, the beauties of which were often replaced; it was desirable to\r\ngive the King a mistress who could form a circle, and in whose\r\ndrawing-room the long-standing attachment of the King for the Duc de\r\nChoiseul might be overcome.  It is true that Madame du Barry was selected\r\nfrom a class sufficiently low.  Her origin, her education, her habits, and\r\neverything about her bore a character of vulgarity and shamelessness; but\r\nby marrying her to a man whose pedigree dated from 1400, it was thought\r\nscandal would be avoided.  The conqueror of Mahon conducted this coarse\r\nintrigue.\r\n\r\n[It appeared at this period as if every feeling of dignity was lost. “Few\r\nnoblemen of the French Court,” says a writer of the time, “preserved\r\nthemselves from the general corruption.  The Marechal de Brissac was one\r\nof the latter.  He was bantered on the strictness of his principles of\r\nhonour and honesty; it was thought strange that he should be offended by\r\nbeing thought, like so many others, exposed to hymeneal disgrace.  Louis\r\nXV., who was present, and laughed at his angry fit, said to him: ‘Come, M.\r\nde Brissac, don’t be angry; ‘tis but a trifling evil; take\r\ncourage.’--‘Sire,’ replied M. de Brissac, ‘I possess all kinds of courage,\r\nexcept that which can brave shame.’”--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nSuch a mistress was judiciously selected for the diversion of the latter\r\nyears of a man weary of grandeur, fatigued with pleasure, and cloyed with\r\nvoluptuousness.  Neither the wit, the talents, the graces of the Marquise\r\nde Pompadour, her beauty, nor even her love for the King, would have had\r\nany further influence over that worn-out being.\r\n\r\nHe wanted a Roxalana of familiar gaiety, without any respect for the\r\ndignity of the sovereign.  Madame du Barry one day so far forgot propriety\r\nas to desire to be present at a Council of State.  The King was weak\r\nenough to consent to it.  There she remained ridiculously perched upon the\r\narm of his chair, playing all sorts of childish monkey tricks, calculated\r\nto please an old sultan.\r\n\r\nAnother time she snatched a packet of sealed letters from the King’s hand.\r\nAmong them she had observed one from Comte de Broglie.  She told the King\r\nthat she knew that rascal Broglie spoke ill of her to him, and that for\r\nonce, at least, she would make sure he should read nothing respecting her.\r\nThe King wanted to get the packet again; she resisted, and made him run\r\ntwo or three times round the table, which was in the middle of the\r\ncouncil-chamber, and then, on passing the fireplace, she threw the letters\r\ninto the grate, where they were consumed.  The King became furious; he\r\nseized his audacious mistress by the arm, and put her out of the door\r\nwithout speaking to her.  Madame du Barry thought herself utterly\r\ndisgraced; she returned home, and remained two hours, alone, abandoned to\r\nthe utmost distress.  The King went to her; she threw herself at his feet,\r\nin tears, and he pardoned her.\r\n\r\nMadame la Marechale de Beauvau, the Duchesse de Choiseul, and the Duchesse\r\nde Grammont had renounced the honour of the King’s intimate acquaintance\r\nrather than share it with Madame du Barry.  But a few years after the\r\ndeath of Louis XV., Madame la Marechale being alone at the Val, a house\r\nbelonging to M. de Beauvau, Mademoiselle de Dillon saw the Countess’s\r\ncalash take shelter in the forest of St. Germain during a violent storm.\r\nShe invited her in, and the Countess herself related these particulars,\r\nwhich I had from Madame de Beauvau.\r\n\r\nThe Comte du Barry, surnamed ‘le roue’ (the profligate), and Mademoiselle\r\ndu Barry advised, or rather prompted, Madame du Barry in furtherance of\r\nthe plans of the party of the Marechal de Richelieu and the Duc\r\nd’Aiguillon.  Sometimes they even set her to act in such a way as to have\r\na useful influence upon great political measures.  Under pretence that the\r\npage who accompanied Charles I. in his flight was a Du Barry or Barrymore,\r\nthey persuaded the Comtesse du Barry to buy in London that fine portrait\r\nwhich we now have in the Museum.  She had the picture placed in her\r\ndrawing-room, and when she saw the King hesitating upon the violent\r\nmeasure of breaking up his Parliament, and forming that which was called\r\nthe Maupeou Parliament, she desired him to look at the portrait of a king\r\nwho had given way to his Parliament.\r\n\r\n[The “Memoirs of General Dumouriez,” vol. i., page 142, contain some\r\ncurious particulars about Madame Du Barry; and novel details respecting\r\nher will be found at page 243 of “Curiosites Historiques,” by J. A. Le Rol\r\n(Paris, Plon, 1864).  His investigations lead to the result that her real\r\nname was Jean Becu, born, 19th August, 1743, at Vaucouleurs, the natural\r\ndaughter of Anne Becu, otherwise known as “Quantiny.”  Her mother\r\nafterwards married Nicolas Rancon.  Comte Jean du Barry met her among the\r\ndemi-monde, and succeeded, about 1767, and by the help of his friend\r\nLabel, the valet de chambre of Louis XV., in introducing her to the King\r\nunder the name of Mademoiselle l’Ange.  To be formally mistress, a husband\r\nhad to be found.  The Comte Jean du Barry, already married himself, found\r\nno difficulty in getting his brother, Comte Guillaume, a poor officer of\r\nthe marine troops, to accept the post of husband.  In the\r\nmarriage-contract, signed on 23d July, 1768, she was described as “the\r\ndaughter of Anne Becu and of an imaginary first husband, Sieur Jean\r\nJacques Gomard de Vaubernier,” and three years were taken off her age.\r\nThe marriage-contract was so drawn as to leave Madame du Barry entirely\r\nfree from all control by her husband.  The marriage was solemnised on 1st\r\nSeptember, 1768, after which the nominal husband returned to Toulouse.\r\nMadame du Barry in later years provided for him; and in 1772, tired of his\r\napplications, she obtained an act of separation from him.  He married\r\nlater Jeanne Madeleine Lemoine, and died in 1811.  Madame du Barry took\r\ncare of her mother, who figured as Madame de Montrable. In all, she\r\nreceived from the King, M. Le Roi calculates, about twelve and a half\r\nmillions of livres.  On the death of Louis XV. she had to retire first to\r\nthe Abbey of Pont-aux-Dames, near Meaux, then she was allowed to go to her\r\nsmall house at St. Vrain, near Arpajon, and, finally, in 1775, to her\r\nchateau at Louveciennes. Much to her credit be it said, she retained many\r\nof her friends, and was on the most intimate terms till his death with the\r\nDuc de Brissac (Louis Hercule Timoldon de Cosse-Brissac), who was killed\r\nat Versailles in the massacre of the prisoners in September, 1792, leaving\r\nat his death a large legacy to her.  Even the Emperor Joseph visited her.\r\nIn 1791 many of her jewels were stolen and taken to England.  This caused\r\nher to make several visits to that country, where she gained her suit.\r\nBut these visits, though she took every precaution to legalise them,\r\nruined her.  Betrayed by her servants, among them by Zamor, the negro\r\npage, she was brought before the Revolutionary tribunal, and was\r\nguillotined on 8th December, 1793, in a frenzy of terror, calling for\r\nmercy and for delay up to the moment when her head fell.]\r\n\r\nThe men of ambition who were labouring to overthrow the Duc de Choiseul\r\nstrengthened themselves by their concentration at the house of the\r\nfavourite, and succeeded in their project.  The bigots, who never forgave\r\nthat minister the suppression of the Jesuits, and who had always been\r\nhostile to a treaty of alliance with Austria, influenced the minds of\r\nMesdames.  The Duc de La Vauguyon, the young Dauphin’s governor, infected\r\nthem with the same prejudices.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the public mind when the young Archduchess Marie\r\nAntoinette arrived at the Court of Versailles, just at the moment when the\r\nparty which brought her there was about to be overthrown.\r\n\r\nMadame Adelaide openly avowed her dislike to a princess of the House of\r\nAustria; and when M. Campan, my father-in-law, went to receive his orders,\r\nat the moment of setting off with the household of the Dauphiness, to go\r\nand receive the Archduchess upon the frontiers, she said she disapproved\r\nof the marriage of her nephew with an archduchess; and that, if she had\r\nthe direction of the matter, she would not send for an Austrian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIE ANTOINETTE JOSEPHE JEANNE DE LORRAINE, Archduchess of Austria,\r\ndaughter of Francois de Lorraine and of Maria Theresa, was born on the 2d\r\nof November, 1755, the day of the earthquake at Lisbon; and this\r\ncatastrophe, which appeared to stamp the era of her birth with a fatal\r\nmark, without forming a motive for superstitious fear with the Princess,\r\nnevertheless made an impression upon her mind.  As the Empress already had\r\na great number of daughters, she ardently desired to have another son, and\r\nplayfully wagered against her wish with the Duc de Tarouka, who had\r\ninsisted that she would give birth to an archduke.  He lost by the birth\r\nof the Princess, and had executed in porcelain a figure with one knee bent\r\non the earth, and presenting tablets, upon which the following lines by\r\nMetastasio were engraved:\r\n\r\nI lose by your fair daughter’s birth\r\nWho prophesied a son;\r\nBut if she share her mother’s worth,\r\nWhy, all the world has won!\r\n\r\nThe Queen was fond of talking of the first years of her youth.  Her\r\nfather, the Emperor Francis, had made a deep impression upon her heart;\r\nshe lost him when she was scarcely seven years old.  One of those\r\ncircumstances which fix themselves strongly in the memories of children\r\nfrequently recalled his last caresses to her.  The Emperor was setting out\r\nfor Innspruck; he had already left his palace, when he ordered a gentleman\r\nto fetch the Archduchess Marie Antoinette, and bring her to his carriage.\r\nWhen she came, he stretched out his arms to receive her, and said, after\r\nhaving pressed her to his bosom, “I wanted to embrace this child once\r\nmore.”  The Emperor died suddenly during the journey, and never saw his\r\nbeloved daughter again.\r\n\r\nThe Queen often spoke of her mother, and with profound respect, but she\r\nbased all her schemes for the education of her children on the essentials\r\nwhich had been neglected in her own.  Maria Theresa, who inspired awe by\r\nher great qualities, taught the Archduchesses to fear and respect rather\r\nthan to love her; at least I observed this in the Queen’s feelings towards\r\nher august mother.  She therefore never desired to place between her own\r\nchildren and herself that distance which had existed in the imperial\r\nfamily.  She cited a fatal consequence of it, which had made such a\r\npowerful impression upon her that time had never been able to efface it.\r\n\r\nThe wife of the Emperor Joseph II. was taken from him in a few days by an\r\nattack of smallpox of the most virulent kind.  Her coffin had recently\r\nbeen deposited in the vault of the imperial family.  The Archduchess\r\nJosepha, who had been betrothed to the King of Naples, at the instant she\r\nwas quitting Vienna received an order from the Empress not to set off\r\nwithout having offered up a prayer in the vault of her forefathers.  The\r\nArchduchess, persuaded that she should take the disorder to which her\r\nsister-in-law had just fallen a victim, looked upon this order as her\r\ndeath-warrant.  She loved the young Archduchess Marie Antoinette tenderly;\r\nshe took her upon her knees, embraced her with tears, and told her she was\r\nabout to leave her, not for Naples, but never to see her again; that she\r\nwas going down then to the tomb of her ancestors, and that she should\r\nshortly go again there to remain.  Her anticipation was realised;\r\nconfluent smallpox carried her off in a very few days, and her youngest\r\nsister ascended the throne of Naples in her place.\r\n\r\nThe Empress was too much taken up with high political interests to have it\r\nin her power to devote herself to maternal attentions.  The celebrated\r\nWansvietten, her physician, went daily, to visit the young imperial\r\nfamily, and afterwards to Maria Theresa, and gave the most minute details\r\nrespecting the health of the Archdukes and Archduchesses, whom she herself\r\nsometimes did not see for eight or ten days at a time.  As soon as the\r\narrival of a stranger of rank at Vienna was made known, the Empress\r\nbrought her family about her, admitted them to her table, and by this\r\nconcerted meeting induced a belief that she herself presided over the\r\neducation of her children.\r\n\r\nThe chief governesses, being under no fear of inspection from Maria\r\nTheresa, aimed at making themselves beloved by their pupils by the common\r\nand blamable practice of indulgence, so fatal to the future progress and\r\nhappiness of children.  Marie Antoinette was the cause of her governess\r\nbeing dismissed, through a confession that all her copies and all her\r\nletters were invariably first traced out with pencil; the Comtesse de\r\nBrandes was appointed to succeed her, and fulfilled her duties with great\r\nexactness and talent.  The Queen looked upon having been confided to her\r\ncare so late as a misfortune, and always continued upon terms of\r\nfriendship with that lady.  The education of Marie Antoinette was\r\ncertainly very much neglected.  With the exception of the Italian\r\nlanguage, all that related to belles lettres, and particularly to history,\r\neven that of her own country, was almost entirely unknown to her.  This\r\nwas soon found out at the Court of France, and thence arose the generally\r\nreceived opinion that she was deficient in sense.  It will be seen in the\r\ncourse of these “Memoirs” whether that opinion was well or ill founded.\r\nThe public prints, however, teemed with assertions of the superior talents\r\nof Maria Theresa’s children.  They often noticed the answers which the\r\nyoung Princesses gave in Latin to the harangues addressed to them; they\r\nuttered them, it is true, but without understanding them; they knew not a\r\nsingle word of that language.\r\n\r\nMention was one day made to the Queen of a drawing made by her, and\r\npresented by the Empress to M. Gerard, chief clerk of Foreign Affairs, on\r\nthe occasion of his going to Vienna to draw up the articles for her\r\nmarriage-contract.  “I should blush,” said she, “if that proof of the\r\nquackery of my education were shown to me.  I do not believe that I ever\r\nput a pencil to that drawing.”  However, what had been taught her she knew\r\nperfectly well.  Her facility of learning was inconceivable, and if all\r\nher teachers had been as well informed and as faithful to their duty as\r\nthe Abbe Metastasio, who taught her Italian, she would have attained as\r\ngreat a superiority in the other branches of her education.  The Queen\r\nspoke that language with grace and ease, and translated the most difficult\r\npoets.  She did not write French correctly, but she spoke it with the\r\ngreatest fluency, and even affected to say that she had lost German.  In\r\nfact she attempted in 1787 to learn her mother-tongue, and took lessons\r\nassiduously for six weeks; she was obliged to relinquish them, finding all\r\nthe difficulties which a Frenchwoman, who should take up the study too\r\nlate, would have to encounter.  In the same manner she gave up English,\r\nwhich I had taught her for some time, and in which she had made rapid\r\nprogress.  Music was the accomplishment in which the Queen most delighted.\r\nShe did not play well on any instrument, but she had become able to read\r\nat sight like a first-rate professor.  She attained this degree of\r\nperfection in France, this branch of her education having been neglected\r\nat Vienna as much as the rest.  A few days after her arrival at\r\nVersailles, she was introduced to her singing-master, La Garde, author of\r\nthe opera of “Egle.”  She made a distant appointment with him, needing, as\r\nshe said, rest after the fatigues of the journey and the numerous fetes\r\nwhich had taken place at Versailles; but her motive was her desire to\r\nconceal how ignorant she was of the rudiments of music.  She asked M.\r\nCampan whether his son, who was a good musician, could give her lessons\r\nsecretly for three months.  “The Dauphiness,” added she, smiling, “must be\r\ncareful of the reputation of the Archduchess.”  The lessons were given\r\nprivately, and at the end of three months of constant application she sent\r\nfor M. la Garde, and surprised him by her skill.\r\n\r\nThe desire to perfect Marie Antoinette in the study of the French language\r\nwas probably the motive which determined Maria Theresa to provide for her\r\nas teachers two French actors: Aufresne, for pronunciation and\r\ndeclamation, and Sainville, for taste in French singing; the latter had\r\nbeen an officer in France, and bore a bad character.  The choice gave just\r\numbrage to our Court.  The Marquis de Durfort, at that time ambassador at\r\nVienna, was ordered to make a representation to the Empress upon her\r\nselection.  The two actors were dismissed, and the Princess required that\r\nan ecclesiastic should be sent to her.  Several eminent ecclesiastics\r\ndeclined taking upon themselves so delicate an office; others who were\r\npointed out by Maria Theresa (among the rest the Abbe Grisel) belonged to\r\nparties which sufficed to exclude them.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Toulouse one day went to the Duc de Choiseul at the\r\nmoment when he was much embarrassed upon the subject of this nomination;\r\nhe proposed to him the Abby de Vermond, librarian of the College des\r\nQuatre Nations.  The eulogistic manner in which he spoke of his protege\r\nprocured the appointment for the latter on that very day; and the\r\ngratitude of the Abbe de Vermond towards the prelate was very fatal to\r\nFrance, inasmuch as after seventeen years of persevering attempts to bring\r\nhim into the ministry, he succeeded at last in getting him named\r\nComptroller-General and President of the Council.--[Comte de Brienne,\r\nlater Archbishop of Sens.]\r\n\r\nThis Abbe de Vermond directed almost all the Queen’s actions.  He\r\nestablished his influence over her at an age when impressions are most\r\ndurable; and it was easy to see that he had taken pains only to render\r\nhimself beloved by his pupil, and had troubled himself very little with\r\nthe care of instructing her.  He might have even been accused of having,\r\nby a sharp-sighted though culpable policy, purposely left her in\r\nignorance.  Marie Antoinette spoke the French language with much grace,\r\nbut wrote it less perfectly.  The Abbe de Vermond revised all the letters\r\nwhich she sent to Vienna.  The insupportable folly with which he boasted\r\nof it displayed the character of a man more flattered at being admitted\r\ninto her intimate secrets than anxious to fulfil worthily the high office\r\nof her preceptor.\r\n\r\n[The Abbe de Vermond encouraged the impatience of etiquette shown by Marie\r\nAntoinette while she was Dauphiness.  When she became Queen he endeavoured\r\nopenly to induce her to shake off the restraints she still respected.  If\r\nhe chanced to enter her apartment at the time she was preparing to go out,\r\n“For whom,” he would say, in a tone of raillery, “is this detachment of\r\nwarriors which I found in the court? Is it some general going to inspect\r\nhis army?  Does all this military display become a young Queen adored by\r\nher subjects?”  He would call to her mind the simplicity with which Maria\r\nTheresa lived; the visits she made without guards, or even attendants, to\r\nthe Prince d’Esterhazy, to the Comte de Palfi, passing whole days far from\r\nthe fatiguing ceremonies of the Court.  The Abbe thus artfully flattered\r\nthe inclinations of Marie Antoinette, and showed her how she might\r\ndisguise, even from herself, her aversion for the ceremonies observed by\r\nthe descendants of Louis XIV.-MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nHis pride received its birth at Vienna, where Maria Theresa, as much to\r\ngive him authority with the Archduchess as to make herself acquainted with\r\nhis character, permitted him to mix every evening with the private circle\r\nof her family, into which the future Dauphiness had been admitted for some\r\ntime.  Joseph II., the elder Archduchess, and a few noblemen honoured by\r\nthe confidence of Maria Theresa, composed the party; and reflections on\r\nthe world, on courts, and the duties of princes were the usual topics of\r\nconversation.  The Abbe de Vermond, in relating these particulars,\r\nconfessed the means which he had made use of to gain admission into this\r\nprivate circle.  The Empress, meeting him at the Archduchess’s, asked him\r\nif he had formed any connections in Vienna. “None, Madame,” replied he;\r\n“the apartment of the Archduchess and the hotel of the ambassador of\r\nFrance are the only places which the man honoured with the care of the\r\nPrincess’s education should frequent.” A month afterwards Maria Theresa,\r\nthrough a habit common enough among sovereigns, asked him the same\r\nquestion, and received precisely the same answer.  The next day he\r\nreceived an order to join the imperial family every evening.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely probable, from the constant and well-known intercourse\r\nbetween this man and Comte de Mercy, ambassador of the Empire during the\r\nwhole reign of Louis XVI., that he was useful to the Court of Vienna, and\r\nthat he often caused the Queen to decide on measures, the consequences of\r\nwhich she did not consider.  Not of high birth, imbued with all the\r\nprinciples of the modern philosophy, and yet holding to the hierarchy of\r\nthe Church more tenaciously than any other ecclesiastic; vain, talkative,\r\nand at the same time cunning and abrupt; very ugly and affecting\r\nsingularity; treating the most exalted persons as his equals, sometimes\r\neven as his inferiors, the Abbe de Vermond received ministers and bishops\r\nwhen in his bath; but said at the same time that Cardinal Dubois was a\r\nfool; that a man such as he, having obtained power, ought to make\r\ncardinals, and refuse to be one himself.\r\n\r\nIntoxicated with the reception he had met with at the Court of Vienna, and\r\nhaving till then seen nothing of high life, the Abbe de Vermond admired no\r\nother customs than those of the imperial family; he ridiculed the\r\netiquette of the House of Bourbon incessantly; the young Dauphiness was\r\nconstantly incited by his sarcasms to get rid of it, and it was he who\r\nfirst induced her to suppress an infinity of practices of which he could\r\ndiscern neither the prudence nor the political aim.  Such is the faithful\r\nportrait of that man whom the evil star of Marie Antoinette had reserved\r\nto guide her first steps upon a stage so conspicuous and so full of danger\r\nas that of the Court of Versailles.\r\n\r\nIt will be thought, perhaps, that I draw the character of the Abbe de\r\nVermond too unfavourably; but how can I view with any complacency one who,\r\nafter having arrogated to himself the office of confidant and sole\r\ncounsellor of the Queen, guided her with so little prudence, and gave us\r\nthe mortification of seeing that Princess blend, with qualities which\r\ncharmed all that surrounded her, errors alike injurious to her glory and\r\nher happiness?\r\n\r\nWhile M. de Choiseul, satisfied with the person whom M. de Brienne had\r\npresented, despatched him to Vienna with every eulogium calculated to\r\ninspire unbounded confidence, the Marquis de Durfort sent off a\r\nhairdresser and a few French fashions; and then it was thought sufficient\r\npains had been taken to form the character of a princess destined to share\r\nthe throne of France.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Monseigneur the Dauphin with the Archduchess was\r\ndetermined upon during the administration of the Duc de Choiseul. The\r\nMarquis de Durfort, who was to succeed the Baron de Breteuil in the\r\nembassy to Vienna, was appointed proxy for the marriage ceremony; but six\r\nmonths after the Dauphin’s marriage the Duc de Choiseul was disgraced, and\r\nMadame de Marsan and Madame de Guemenee, who grew more powerful through\r\nthe Duke’s disgrace, conferred that embassy, upon Prince Louis de Rohan,\r\nafterwards cardinal and grand almoner.\r\n\r\nHence it will be seen that the Gazette de France is a sufficient answer to\r\nthose libellers who dared to assert that the young Archduchess was\r\nacquainted with the Cardinal de Rohan before the period of her marriage. A\r\nworse selection in itself, or one more disagreeable to Maria Theresa, than\r\nthat which sent to her, in quality, of ambassador, a man so frivolous and\r\nso immoral as Prince Louis de Rohan, could not have been made.  He\r\npossessed but superficial knowledge upon any subject, and was totally\r\nignorant of diplomatic affairs.  His reputation had gone before him to\r\nVienna, and his mission opened under the most unfavourable auspices.  In\r\nwant of money, and the House of Rohan being unable to make him any\r\nconsiderable advances, he obtained from his Court a patent which\r\nauthorised him to borrow the sum of 600,000 livres upon his benefices, ran\r\nin debt above a million, and thought to dazzle the city and Court of\r\nVienna by the most indecent and ill-judged extravagance.  He formed a\r\nsuite of eight or ten gentlemen, of names sufficiently high-sounding;\r\ntwelve pages equally well born, a crowd of officers and servants, a\r\ncompany of chamber musicians, etc.  But this idle pomp did not last;\r\nembarrassment and distress soon showed themselves; his people, no longer\r\nreceiving pay, in order to make money, abused the privileges of\r\nambassadors, and smuggled with so much effrontery that Maria Theresa, to\r\nput a stop to it without offending the Court of France, was compelled to\r\nsuppress the privileges in this respect of all the diplomatic bodies, a\r\nstep which rendered the person and conduct of Prince Louis odious in\r\nevery foreign Court.\r\n\r\n[I have often heard the Queen say that, at Vienna, in the office of the\r\nsecretary of the Prince de Rohan, there were sold in one year more silk\r\nstockings than at Lyons and Paris together.--MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nHe seldom obtained private audiences from the Empress, who did not esteem\r\nhim, and who expressed herself without reserve upon his conduct both as a\r\nbishop and as an ambassador.  He thought to obtain favour by assisting to\r\neffect the marriage of the Archduchess Elizabeth, the elder sister of\r\nMarie Antoinette, with Louis XV., an affair which was awkwardly\r\nundertaken, and of which Madame du Barry had no difficulty in causing the\r\nfailure.  I have deemed it my duty to omit no particular of the moral and\r\npolitical character of a man whose existence was subsequently so injurious\r\nto the reputation of Marie Antoinette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nA superb pavilion had been prepared upon the frontier near Kehl.  It\r\nconsisted of a vast salon, connected with two apartments, one of which was\r\nassigned to the lords and ladies of the Court of Vienna, and the other to\r\nthe suite of the Dauphiness, composed of the Comtesse de Noailles, her\r\nlady of honour; the Duchesse de Cosse, her dame d’atours; four ladies of\r\nthe palace; the Comte de Saulx-Tavannes, chevalier d’honneur; the Comte de\r\nTesse, first equerry; the Bishop of Chartres, first almoner; the officers\r\nof the Body Guard, and the equerries.\r\n\r\nWhen the Dauphiness had been entirely undressed, in order that she might\r\nretain nothing belonging to a foreign Court (an etiquette always observed\r\non such an occasion), the doors were opened; the young Princess came\r\nforward, looking round for the Comtesse de Noailles; then, rushing into\r\nher arms, she implored her, with tears in her eyes, and with heartfelt\r\nsincerity, to be her guide and support.\r\n\r\nWhile doing justice to the virtues of the Comtesse de Noailles, those\r\nsincerely attached to the Queen have always considered it as one of her\r\nearliest misfortunes not to have found, in the person of her adviser, a\r\nwoman indulgent, enlightened, and administering good advice with that\r\namiability which disposes young persons to follow it.  The Comtesse de\r\nNoailles had nothing agreeable in her appearance; her demeanour was stiff\r\nand her mien severe.  She was perfect mistress of etiquette; but she\r\nwearied the young Princess with it, without making her sensible of its\r\nimportance.  It would have been sufficient to represent to the Dauphiness\r\nthat in France her dignity depended much upon customs not necessary at\r\nVienna to secure the respect and love of the good and submissive Austrians\r\nfor the imperial family; but the Dauphiness was perpetually tormented by\r\nthe remonstrances of the Comtesse de Noailles, and at the same time was\r\nled by the Abbe de Vermond to ridicule both the lessons upon etiquette and\r\nher who gave them.  She preferred raillery to argument, and nicknamed the\r\nComtesse de Noailles Madame l’Etiquette.\r\n\r\nThe fetes which were given at Versailles on the marriage of the Dauphin\r\nwere very splendid.  The Dauphiness arrived there at the hour for her\r\ntoilet, having slept at La Muette, where Louis XV. had been to receive\r\nher; and where that Prince, blinded by a feeling unworthy of a sovereign\r\nand the father of a family, caused the young Princess, the royal family,\r\nand the ladies of the Court, to sit down to supper with Madame du Barry.\r\n\r\nThe Dauphiness was hurt at this conduct; she spoke of it openly enough to\r\nthose with whom she was intimate, but she knew how to conceal her\r\ndissatisfaction in public, and her behaviour showed no signs of it.\r\n\r\nShe was received at Versailles in an apartment on the ground floor, under\r\nthat of the late Queen, which was not ready for her until six months after\r\nher marriage.\r\n\r\nThe Dauphiness, then fifteen years of age, beaming with freshness,\r\nappeared to all eyes more than beautiful.  Her walk partook at once of the\r\ndignity of the Princesses of her house, and of the grace of the French;\r\nher eyes were mild, her smile amiable.  When she went to chapel, as soon\r\nas she had taken the first few steps in the long gallery, she discerned,\r\nall the way to its extremity, those persons whom she ought to salute with\r\nthe consideration due to their rank; those on whom she should bestow an\r\ninclination of the head; and lastly, those who were to be satisfied with a\r\nsmile, calculated to console them for not being entitled to greater\r\nhonours.\r\n\r\nLouis XV. was enchanted with the young Dauphiness; all his conversation\r\nwas about her graces, her vivacity, and the aptness of her repartees. She\r\nwas yet more successful with the royal family when they beheld her shorn\r\nof the splendour of the diamonds with which she had been adorned during\r\nthe first days of her marriage.  When clothed in a light dress of gauze or\r\ntaffety she was compared to the Venus dei Medici, and the Atalanta of the\r\nMarly Gardens.  Poets sang her charms; painters attempted to copy her\r\nfeatures.  One artist’s fancy led him to place the portrait of Marie\r\nAntoinette in the heart of a full-blown rose.  His ingenious idea was\r\nrewarded by Louis XV.\r\n\r\nThe King continued to talk only of the Dauphiness; and Madame du Barry\r\nill-naturedly endeavoured to damp his enthusiasm.  Whenever Marie\r\nAntoinette was the topic, she pointed out the irregularity of her\r\nfeatures, criticised the ‘bons mots’ quoted as hers, and rallied the King\r\nupon his prepossession in her favour.  Madame du Barry was affronted at\r\nnot receiving from the Dauphiness those attentions to which she thought\r\nherself entitled; she did not conceal her vexation from the King; she was\r\nafraid that the grace and cheerfulness of the young Princess would make\r\nthe domestic circle of the royal family more agreeable to the old\r\nsovereign, and that he would escape her chains; at the same time, hatred\r\nto the Choiseul party contributed powerfully to excite the enmity of the\r\nfavourite.\r\n\r\nThe fall of that minister took place in November, 1770, six months after\r\nhis long influence in the Council had brought about the alliance with the\r\nHouse of Austria and the arrival of Marie Antoinette at the Court of\r\nFrance.  The Princess, young, frank, volatile, and inexperienced, found\r\nherself without any other guide than the Abbe de Vermond, in a Court ruled\r\nby the enemy of the minister who had brought her there, and in the midst\r\nof people who hated Austria, and detested any alliance with the imperial\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d’Aiguillon, the Duc de La Vauguyon, the Marechal de Richelieu,\r\nthe Rohans, and other considerable families, who had made use of Madame du\r\nBarry to overthrow the Duke, could not flatter themselves, notwithstanding\r\ntheir powerful intrigues, with a hope of being able to break off an\r\nalliance solemnly announced, and involving such high political interests.\r\nThey therefore changed their mode of attack, and it will be seen how the\r\nconduct of the Dauphin served as a basis for their hopes.\r\n\r\nThe Dauphiness continually gave proofs of both sense and feeling.\r\nSometimes she even suffered herself to be carried away by those transports\r\nof compassionate kindness which are not to be controlled by the customs\r\nwhich rank establishes.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the fire in the Place Louis XV., which occurred at the\r\ntime of the nuptial entertainments, the Dauphin and Dauphiness sent their,\r\nwhole income for the year to the relief of the unfortunate families who\r\nlost their relatives on that disastrous day.\r\n\r\nThis was one of those ostentatious acts of generosity which are dictated\r\nby the policy of princes, at least as much as by their compassion; but the\r\ngrief of Marie Antoinette was profound, and lasted several days; nothing\r\ncould console her for the loss of so many innocent victims; she spoke of\r\nit, weeping, to her ladies, one of whom, thinking, no doubt, to divert her\r\nmind, told her that a great number of thieves had been found among the\r\nbodies, and that their pockets were filled with watches and other\r\nvaluables.  “They have at least been well punished,” added the person who\r\nrelated these particulars.  “Oh, no, no, madame!” replied the Dauphiness;\r\n“they died by the side of honest people.”\r\n\r\nThe Dauphiness had brought from Vienna a considerable number of white\r\ndiamonds; the King added to them the gift of the diamonds and pearls of\r\nthe late Dauphiness, and also put into her hands a collar of pearls, of a\r\nsingle row, the smallest of which was as large as a filbert, and which had\r\nbeen brought into France by Anne of Austria, and appropriated by that\r\nPrincess to the use of the Queens and Dauphinesses of France.\r\n\r\nThe three Princesses, daughters of Louis XV., joined in making her\r\nmagnificent presents.  Madame Adelaide at the same time gave the young\r\nPrincess a key to the private corridors of the Chateau, by means of which,\r\nwithout any suite, and without being perceived, she could get to the\r\napartments of her aunts, and see them in private.  The Dauphiness, on\r\nreceiving the key, told them, with infinite grace, that if they had meant\r\nto make her appreciate the superb presents they were kind enough to bestow\r\nupon her, they should not at the same time have offered her one of such\r\ninestimable value; since to that key she should be indebted for an\r\nintimacy and advice unspeakably precious at her age.  She did, indeed,\r\nmake use of it very frequently; but Madame Victoire alone permitted her,\r\nso long as she continued Dauphiness, to visit her familiarly.  Madame\r\nAdelaide could not overcome her prejudices against Austrian princesses,\r\nand was wearied with the somewhat petulant gaiety of the Dauphiness.\r\nMadame Victoire was concerned at this, feeling that their society and\r\ncounsel would have been highly useful to a young person otherwise likely\r\nto meet with none but sycophants.  She endeavoured, therefore, to induce\r\nher to take pleasure in the society of the Marquise de Durfort, her lady\r\nof honour and favourite.  Several agreeable entertainments took place at\r\nthe house of this lady, but the Comtesse de Noailles and the Abbe de\r\nVermond soon opposed these meetings.\r\n\r\nA circumstance which happened in hunting, near the village of Acheres, in\r\nthe forest of Fontainebleau, afforded the young Princess an opportunity of\r\ndisplaying her respect for old age, and her compassion for misfortune.  An\r\naged peasant was wounded by the stag; the Dauphiness jumped out of her\r\ncalash, placed the peasant, with his wife and children, in it, had the\r\nfamily taken back to their cottage, and bestowed upon them every attention\r\nand every necessary assistance.  Her heart was always open to the feelings\r\nof compassion, and the recollection of her rank never restrained her\r\nsensibility.  Several persons in her service entered her room one evening,\r\nexpecting to find nobody there but the officer in waiting; they perceived\r\nthe young Princess seated by the side of this man, who was advanced in\r\nyears; she had placed near him a bowl full of water, was stanching the\r\nblood which issued from a wound he had received in his hand with her\r\nhandkerchief, which she had torn up to bind it, and was fulfilling towards\r\nhim all the duties of a pious sister of charity. The old man, affected\r\neven to tears, out of respect allowed his august mistress to act as she\r\nthought proper.  He had hurt himself in endeavouring to move a rather\r\nheavy piece of furniture at the Princess’s request.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, 1770, an unfortunate occurrence that took place in a\r\nfamily which the Dauphiness honoured with her favour contributed again to\r\nshow not only her sensibility but also the benevolence of her disposition.\r\nOne of her women in waiting had a son who was an officer in the gens\r\nd’armes of the guard; this young man thought himself affronted by a clerk\r\nin the War Department, and imprudently sent him a challenge; he killed his\r\nadversary in the forest of Compiegne.  The family of the young man who was\r\nkilled, being in possession of the challenge, demanded justice.  The King,\r\ndistressed on account of several duels which had recently taken place, had\r\nunfortunately declared that he would show no mercy on the first event of\r\nthat kind which could be proved; the culprit was therefore arrested.  His\r\nmother, in the deepest grief, hastened to throw herself at the feet of the\r\nDauphiness, the Dauphin, and the young Princesses.  After an hour’s\r\nsupplication they obtained from the King the favour so much desired.  On\r\nthe next day a lady of rank, while congratulating the Dauphiness, had the\r\nmalice to add that the mother had neglected no means of success on the\r\noccasion, having solicited not only the royal family, but even Madame du\r\nBarry.  The Dauphiness replied that the fact justified the favourable\r\nopinion she had formed of the worthy woman; that the heart of a mother\r\nshould hesitate at nothing for the salvation of her son; and that in her\r\nplace, if she had thought it would be serviceable, she would have thrown\r\nherself at the feet of Zamor.\r\n\r\n[A little Indian who carried the Comtesse du Barry’s train.  Louis XV.\r\noften amused himself with the little marmoset, and jestingly made him\r\nGovernor of Louveciennes; he received an annual income of 3,000 francs.]\r\n\r\nSome time after the marriage entertainments the Dauphiness made her entry\r\ninto Paris, and was received with transports of joy.  After dining in the\r\nKing’s apartment at the Tuileries, she was forced, by the reiterated\r\nshouts of the multitude, with whom the garden was filled, to present\r\nherself upon the balcony fronting the principal walk.  On seeing such a\r\ncrowd of heads with their eyes fixed upon her, she exclaimed, “Grand-Dieu!\r\nwhat a concourse!”--“Madame,” said the old Duc de Brissac, the Governor of\r\nParis, “I may tell you, without fear of offending the Dauphin, that they\r\nare so many lovers.”  2 The Dauphin took no umbrage at either acclamations\r\nor marks of homage of which the Dauphiness was the object.  The most\r\nmortifying indifference, a coldness which frequently degenerated into\r\nrudeness, were the sole feelings which the young Prince then manifested\r\ntowards her.  Not all her charms could gain even upon his senses.  This\r\nestrangement, which lasted a long time, was said to be the work of the Duc\r\nde La Vauguyon.\r\n\r\nThe Dauphiness, in fact, had no sincere friends at Court except the Duc de\r\nChoiseul and his party.  Will it be credited that the plans laid against\r\nMarie Antoinette went so far as divorce?  I have been assured of it by\r\npersons holding high situations at Court, and many circumstances tend to\r\nconfirm the opinion.  On the journey to Fontainebleau, in the year of the\r\nmarriage, the inspectors of public buildings were gained over to manage so\r\nthat the apartment intended for the Dauphin, communicating with that of\r\nthe Dauphiness, should not be finished, and a room at the extremity of the\r\nbuilding was temporarily assigned to him.  The Dauphiness, aware that this\r\nwas the result of intrigue, had the courage to complain of it to Louis\r\nXV., who, after severe reprimands, gave orders so positive that within the\r\nweek the apartment was ready.  Every method was tried to continue or\r\naugment the indifference which the Dauphin long manifested towards his\r\nyouthful spouse.  She was deeply hurt at it, but she never suffered\r\nherself to utter the slightest complaint on the subject.  Inattention to,\r\neven contempt for, the charms which she heard extolled on all sides,\r\nnothing induced her to break silence; and some tears, which would\r\ninvoluntarily burst from her eyes, were the sole symptoms of her inward\r\nsufferings discoverable by those in her service.\r\n\r\nOnce only, when tired out with the misplaced remonstrances of an old lady\r\nattached to her person, who wished to dissuade her from riding on\r\nhorseback, under the impression that it would prevent her producing heirs\r\nto the crown, “Mademoiselle,” said she, “in God’s name, leave me in peace;\r\nbe assured that I can put no heir in danger.”\r\n\r\nThe Dauphiness found at the Court of Louis XV., besides the three\r\nPrincesses, the King’s daughters, the Princes also, brothers of the\r\nDauphin, who were receiving their education, and Clotilde and Elisabeth,\r\nstill in the care of Madame de Marsan, governess of the children of\r\nFrance.  The elder of the two latter Princesses, in 1777, married the\r\nPrince of Piedmont, afterwards King of Sardinia.  This Princess was in her\r\ninfancy, so extremely large that the people nicknamed her ‘gros Madame.’\r\n\r\n[Madame Clotilde of France, a sister of the King, was extraordinarily fat\r\nfor her height and age.  One of her playfellows, having been indiscreet\r\nenough even in her presence to make use of the nickname given to her,\r\nreceived a severe reprimand from the Comtesse de Marsan, who hinted to her\r\nthat she would do well in not making her appearance again before the\r\nPrincess.  Madame Clotilde sent for her the next day: “My governess,” said\r\nshe, “has done her duty, and I will do mine; come and see me as usual, and\r\nthink no more of a piece of inadvertence, which I myself have forgotten.”\r\n This Princess, so heavy in body, possessed the most agreeable and playful\r\nwit.  Her affability and grace rendered her dear to all who came near\r\nher.--NOTE BY THE EDITOR]\r\n\r\nThe second Princess was the pious Elisabeth, the victim of her respect and\r\ntender attachment for the King, her brother.  She was still scarcely out\r\nof her leading-strings at the period of the Dauphin’s marriage.  The\r\nDauphiness showed her marked preference.  The governess, who sought to\r\nadvance the Princess to whom nature had been least favourable, was\r\noffended at the Dauphiness’s partiality for Madame Elisabeth, and by her\r\ninjudicious complaints weakened the friendship which yet subsisted between\r\nMadame Clotilde and Marie Antoinette.  There even arose some degree of\r\nrivalry on the subject of education; and that which the Empress Maria\r\nTheresa bestowed on her daughters was talked of openly and unfavourably\r\nenough.  The Abbe de Vermond thought himself affronted, took a part in the\r\nquarrel, and added his complaints and jokes to those of the Dauphiness on\r\nthe criticisms of the governess; he even indulged himself in his turn in\r\nreflections on the tuition of Madame Clotilde. Everything becomes known at\r\nCourt.  Madame de Marsan was informed of all that had been said in the\r\nDauphiness’s circle, and was very angry with her on account of it.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment a centre of intrigue, or rather gossip, against Marie\r\nAntoinette was established round Madame de Marsan’s fireside; her most\r\ntrifling actions were there construed ill; her gaiety, and the harmless\r\namusements in which she sometimes indulged in her own apartments with the\r\nmore youthful ladies of her train, and even with the women in her service,\r\nwere stigmatised as criminal.  Prince Louis de Rohan, sent through the\r\ninfluence of this clique ambassador to Vienna, was the echo there of these\r\nunmerited comments, and threw himself into a series of culpable\r\naccusations which he proffered under the guise of zeal.  He ceaselessly\r\nrepresented the young Dauphiness as alienating all hearts by levities\r\nunsuitable to the dignity of the French Court.  The Princess frequently\r\nreceived from the Court of Vienna remonstrances, of the origin of which\r\nshe could not long remain in ignorance.  From this period must be dated\r\nthat aversion which she never ceased to manifest for the Prince de Rohan.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Dauphiness received information of a letter\r\nwritten by Prince Louis to the Duc d’Aiguillon, in which the ambassador\r\nexpressed himself in very free language respecting the intentions of Maria\r\nTheresa with relation to the partition of Poland.  This letter of Prince\r\nLouis had been read at the Comtesse du Barry’s; the levity of the\r\nambassador’s correspondence wounded the feelings and the dignity of the\r\nDauphiness at Versailles, while at Vienna the representations which he\r\nmade to Maria Theresa against the young Princess terminated in rendering\r\nthe motives of his incessant complaints suspected by the Empress.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa at length determined on sending her private secretary, Baron\r\nde Neni, to Versailles, with directions to observe the conduct of the\r\nDauphiness with attention, and form a just estimate of the opinion of the\r\nCourt and of Paris with regard to that Princess.  The Baron de Neni, after\r\nhaving devoted sufficient time and intelligence to the subject, undeceived\r\nhis sovereign as to the exaggerations of the French ambassador; and the\r\nEmpress had no difficulty in detecting, among the calumnies which he had\r\nconveyed to her under the specious excuse of anxiety for her august\r\ndaughter, proofs of the enmity of a, party which had never approved of the\r\nalliance of the House of Bourbon with her own.\r\n\r\nAt this period the Dauphiness, though unable to obtain any influence over\r\nthe heart of her husband, dreading Louis XV., and justly mistrusting\r\neverything connected with Madame du Barry and the Duc d’Aiguillon, had not\r\ndeserved the slightest reproach for that sort of levity which hatred and\r\nher misfortunes afterwards construed into crime.  The Empress, convinced\r\nof the innocence of Marie Antoinette, directed the Baron de Neni to\r\nsolicit the recall of the Prince de Rohan, and to inform the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of all the motives which made her require it; but the\r\nHouse of Rohan interposed between its protege and the Austrian envoy, and\r\nan evasive answer merely was given.\r\n\r\nIt was not until two months after the death of Louis XV.  that the Court\r\nof Vienna obtained his recall.  The avowed grounds for requiring it were,\r\nfirst, the public gallantries of Prince Louis with some ladies of the\r\nCourt and others; secondly, his surliness and haughtiness towards other\r\nforeign ministers, which would have had more serious consequences,\r\nespecially with the ministers of England and Denmark, if the Empress\r\nherself had not interfered; thirdly, his contempt for religion in a\r\ncountry where it was particularly necessary to show respect for it. He had\r\nbeen seen frequently to dress himself in clothes of different colours,\r\nassuming the hunting uniforms of various noblemen whom he visited, with so\r\nmuch audacity that one day in particular, during the Fete-Dieu, he and all\r\nhis legation, in green uniforms laced with gold, broke through a\r\nprocession which impeded them, in order to make their way to a hunting\r\nparty at the Prince de Paar’s; and fourthly, the immense debts contracted\r\nby him and his people, which were tardily and only in part discharged.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding marriages of the Comte de Provence and the Comte d’Artois\r\nwith two daughters of the King of Sardinia procured society for the\r\nDauphiness more suitable to her age, and altered her mode of life.\r\n\r\nA pair of tolerably fine eyes drew forth, in favour of the Comtesse de\r\nProvence, upon her arrival at Versailles, the only praises which could\r\nreasonably be bestowed upon her.  The Comtesse d’Artois, though not\r\ndeformed, was very small; she had a fine complexion; her face, tolerably\r\npleasing, was not remarkable for anything except the extreme length of the\r\nnose.  But being good and generous, she was beloved by those about her,\r\nand even possessed some influence so long as she was the only Princess who\r\nhad produced heirs to the crown.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the closest intimacy subsisted between the three young\r\nfamilies.  They took their meals together, except on those days when they\r\ndined in public.  This manner of living en famille continued until the\r\nQueen sometimes indulged herself in going to dine with the Duchesse de\r\nPolignac, when she was governess; but the evening meetings at supper were\r\nnever interrupted; they took place at the house of the Comtesse de\r\nProvence.  Madame Elisabeth made one of the party when she had finished\r\nher education, and sometimes Mesdames, the King’s aunts, were invited. The\r\ncustom, which had no precedent at Court, was the work of Marie Antoinette,\r\nand she maintained it with the utmost perseverance.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Versailles saw no change in point of etiquette during the\r\nreign of Louis XV.  Play took place at the house of the Dauphiness, as\r\nbeing the first lady of the State.  It had, from the death of Queen Maria\r\nLeczinska to the marriage of the Dauphin, been held at the abode of Madame\r\nAdelade.  This removal, the result of an order of precedence not to be\r\nviolated, was not the less displeasing to Madame Adelaide, who established\r\na separate party for play in her apartments, and scarcely ever went to\r\nthat which not only the Court in general, but also the royal family, were\r\nexpected to attend.  The full-dress visits to the King on his ‘debotter’\r\nwere continued.  High mass was attended daily.  The airings of the\r\nPrincesses were nothing more than rapid races in berlins, during which\r\nthey were accompanied by Body Guards, equerries, and pages on horseback.\r\nThey galloped for some leagues from Versailles.  Calashes were used only\r\nin hunting.\r\n\r\nThe young Princesses were desirous to infuse animation into their circle\r\nof associates by something useful as well as pleasant.  They adopted the\r\nplan of learning and performing all the best plays of the French theatre.\r\nThe Dauphin was the only spectator.  The three Princesses, the two\r\nbrothers of the King, and Messieurs Campan, father and son, were the sole\r\nperformers, but they endeavoured to keep this amusement as secret as an\r\naffair of State; they dreaded the censure of Mesdames, and they had no\r\ndoubt that Louis XV. would forbid such pastimes if he knew of them.  They\r\nselected for their performance a cabinet in the entresol which nobody had\r\noccasion to enter.\r\n\r\nA kind of proscenium, which could be taken down and shut up in a closet,\r\nformed the whole theatre.  The Comte de Provence always knew his part with\r\nimperturbable accuracy; the Comte d’Artois knew his tolerably well, and\r\nrecited elegantly; the Princesses acted badly.  The Dauphiness acquitted\r\nherself in some characters with discrimination and feeling. The chief\r\npleasure of this amusement consisted in all the costumes being elegant and\r\naccurate.  The Dauphin entered into the spirit of these diversions, and\r\nlaughed heartily at the comic characters as they came on the scene; from\r\nthese amusements may be dated his discontinuance of the timid manner of\r\nhis youth, and his taking pleasure in the society of the Dauphiness.\r\n\r\nIt was not till a long time afterwards that I learnt these particulars, M.\r\nCampan having kept the secret; but an unforeseen event had well-nigh\r\nexposed the whole mystery.  One day the Queen desired M. Campan to go down\r\ninto her closet to fetch something that she had forgotten; he was dressed\r\nfor the character of Crispin, and was rouged.  A private staircase led\r\ndirect to the entresol through the dressing-room.  M. Campan fancied he\r\nheard some noise, and remained still, behind the door, which was shut.  A\r\nservant belonging to the wardrobe, who was, in fact, on the staircase, had\r\nalso heard some noise, and, either from fear or curiosity, he suddenly\r\nopened the door; the figure of Crispin frightened him so that he fell down\r\nbackwards, shouting with his might, “Help! help!”  My father-in-law raised\r\nhim up, made him recognise his voice, and laid upon him an injunction of\r\nsilence as to what he had seen. He felt himself, however, bound to inform\r\nthe Dauphiness of what had happened, and she was afraid that a similar\r\noccurrence might betray their amusements.  They were therefore\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\nThe Princess occupied her time in her own apartment in the study of music\r\nand the parts in plays which she had to learn; the latter exercise, at\r\nleast, produced the beneficial effect of strengthening her memory and\r\nfamiliarising her with the French language.\r\n\r\nWhile Louis XV.  reigned, the enemies of Marie Antoinette made no attempt\r\nto change public opinion with regard to her.  She was always popular with\r\nthe French people in general, and particularly with the inhabitants of\r\nParis, who went on every opportunity to Versailles, the majority of them\r\nattracted solely by the pleasure of seeing her.  The courtiers did not\r\nfully enter into the popular enthusiasm which the Dauphiness had inspired;\r\nthe disgrace of the Duc de Choiseul had removed her real support from her;\r\nand the party which had the ascendency at Court since the exile of that\r\nminister was, politically, as much opposed to her family as to herself.\r\nThe Dauphiness was therefore surrounded by enemies at Versailles.\r\n\r\nNevertheless everybody appeared outwardly desirous to please her; for the\r\nage of Louis XV., and the apathetic character of the Dauphin, sufficiently\r\nwarned courtiers of the important part reserved for the Princess during\r\nthe following reign, in case the Dauphin should become attached to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of May, 1774, Louis XV., the strength of whose\r\nconstitution had promised a long enough life, was attacked by confluent\r\nsmallpox of the worst kind.  Mesdames at this juncture inspired the\r\nDauphiness with a feeling of respect and attachment, of which she gave\r\nthem repeated proofs when she ascended the throne.  In fact, nothing was\r\nmore admirable nor more affecting than the courage with which they braved\r\nthat most horrible disease.  The air of the palace was infected; more than\r\nfifty persons took the smallpox, in consequence of having merely loitered\r\nin the galleries of Versailles, and ten died of it.\r\n\r\nThe end of the monarch was approaching.  His reign, peaceful in general,\r\nhad inherited strength from the power of his predecessor; on the other\r\nhand, his own weakness had been preparing misfortune for whoever should\r\nreign after him.  The scene was about to change; hope, ambition, joy,\r\ngrief, and all those feelings which variously affected the hearts of the\r\ncourtiers, sought in vain to disguise themselves under a calm exterior. It\r\nwas easy to detect the different motives which induced them every moment\r\nto repeat to every one the question: “How is the King?”  At length, on the\r\n10th of May, 1774, the mortal career of Louis XV. terminated.\r\n\r\n[Christopher de Beaumont, Archbishop of Paris, the ardent apostle of\r\nfrequent communion, arrived at Paris with the intention of soliciting, in\r\npublic, the administration of the sacrament to the King, and secretly\r\nretarding it as much as possible.  The ceremony could not take place\r\nwithout the previous and public expulsion of the, concubine, according to\r\nthe canons of the Church and the Jesuitical party, of which Christopher\r\nwas the leader.  This party, which had made use of Madame du Barry to\r\nsuppress the Parliaments, to support the Duc d’Aiguillon, and ruin the\r\nChoiseul faction, could not willingly consent to disgrace her canonically.\r\nThe Archbishop went into the King’s bedchamber, and found there Madame\r\nAdelaide, the Duc d’Aumont, the Bishop of Senlis, and Richelieu, in whose\r\npresence he resolved not to say one word about confession for that day.\r\nThis reticence so encouraged Louis XV. that, on the Archbishop\r\nwithdrawing, he had Madame du Barry called in, and kissed her beautiful\r\nhands again with his wonted affection.  On the 2d of May the King found\r\nhimself a little better.  Madame du Barry had brought him two confidential\r\nphysicians, Lorry and Borden, who were enjoined to conceal the nature of\r\nhis sickness from him in order to keep off the priests and save her from a\r\nhumiliating dismissal.  The King’s improvement allowed Madame du Barry to\r\ndivert him by her usual playfulness and conversation.  But La Martiniere,\r\nwho was of the Choiseul party, and to whom they durst not refuse his right\r\nof entry, did not conceal from the King either the nature or the danger of\r\nhis sickness.  The King then sent for Madame du Barry, and said to her:\r\n“My love, I have got the smallpox, and my illness is very dangerous on\r\naccount of my age and other disorders.  I ought not to forget that I am\r\nthe most Christian King, and the eldest son of the Church.  I am\r\nsixty-four; the time is perhaps approaching when we must separate.  I wish\r\nto prevent a scene like that of Metz.” (when, in 1744, he had dismissed\r\nthe Duchesse de Chateauroux.) “Apprise the Duc d’Aiguillon of what I say,\r\nthat he may arrange with you if my sickness grows worse; so that we may\r\npart without any publicity.”  The Jansenists and the Duc de Choiseurs\r\nparty publicly said that M. d’Aiguillon and the Archbishop had resolved to\r\nlet the King die without receiving the sacrament rather than disturb\r\nMadame du Barry.  Annoyed by their remarks, Beaumont determined to go and\r\nreside at the Lazaristes, his house at Versailles, to avail himself of the\r\nKing’s last moments, and sacrifice Madame du Barry when the monarch’s\r\ncondition should become desperate.  He arrived on the 3d of May, but did\r\nnot see the King.  Under existing circumstances, his object was to humble\r\nthe enemies of his party and to support the favourite who had assisted to\r\novercome them.\r\n\r\nA contrary zeal animated the Bishop of Carcassonne, who urged that “the\r\nKing ought to receive the sacrament; and by expelling the concubine to\r\ngive an example of repentance to France and Christian Europe, which he had\r\nscandalised.”--“By what right,” said Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon, a\r\ncomplaisant courtier with whom the Bishop was at daggers drawn, “do you\r\ninstruct me?”--“There is my authority,” replied the Bishop, holding up his\r\npectoral cross.  “Learn, monseigneur, to respect it, and do not suffer\r\nyour King to die without the sacraments of the Church, of which he is the\r\neldest son.”  The Duc d’Aiguillon and the Archbishop, who witnessed the\r\ndiscussion, put an end to it by asking for the King’s orders relative to\r\nMadame du Barry.  “She must be taken quietly to your seat at Ruelle,” said\r\nthe King; “I shall be grateful for the care Madame d’Aiguillon may take of\r\nher.”\r\n\r\nMadame du Barry saw the King again for a moment on the evening of the 4th,\r\nand promised to return to Court upon his recovery.  She was scarcely gone\r\nwhen the King asked for her.  “She is gone,” was the answer.  From that\r\nmoment the disorder gained ground; he thought himself a dead man, without\r\nthe possibility of recovery.  The 5th and 6th passed without a word of\r\nconfession, viaticum, or extreme unction.  The Duc de Fronsac threatened\r\nto throw the Cure of Versailles out of the window if he dared to mention\r\nthem, but on the 7th, at three in the morning, the King imperatively\r\ncalled for the Abbe Maudous.  Confession lasted seventeen minutes.  The\r\nDucs de la Vrillilere and d’Aiguillon wished to delay the viaticum; but La\r\nMartiniere said to the King: “Sire, I have seen your Majesty in very\r\ntrying circumstances; but never admired you as I have done to-day. No\r\ndoubt your Majesty will immediately finish what you have so well begun.”\r\n The King had his confessor Maudoua called back; this was a poor priest who\r\nhad been placed about him for some years before because he was old and\r\nblind.  He gave him absolution.\r\n\r\nThe formal renunciation desired by the Choiseul party, in order to humble\r\nand annihilate Madame du Barry with solemnity, was no more mentioned.  The\r\ngrand almoner, in concert with the Archbishop, composed this formula,\r\npronounced in presence of the viaticum: “Although the King owes an account\r\nof his conduct to none but God, he declares his repentance at having\r\nscandalised his subjects, and is desirous to live solely for the\r\nmaintenance of religion and the happiness of his people.”\r\n\r\nOn the 8th and 9th the disorder grew worse; and the King beheld the whole\r\nsurface of his body coming off piecemeal and corrupted. Deserted by his\r\nfriends and by that crowd of courtiers which had so long cringed before\r\nhim, his only consolation was the piety of his daughters.--SOULAVIE,\r\n“Historical and Political Memoirs,” vol. i.]\r\n\r\nThe Comtesse du Barry had, a few days previously, withdrawn to Ruelle, to\r\nthe Duc d’Aiguillon’s.  Twelve or fifteen persons belonging to the Court\r\nthought it their duty to visit her there; their liveries were observed,\r\nand these visits were for a long time grounds for disfavour.  More than\r\nsix years after the King’s death one of these persons being spoken of in\r\nthe circle of the royal family, I heard it remarked, “That was one of the\r\nfifteen Ruelle carriages.”\r\n\r\nThe whole Court went to the Chateau; the oiel-de boeuf was filled with\r\ncourtiers, and the palace with the inquisitive.  The Dauphin had settled\r\nthat he would depart with the royal family the moment the King should\r\nbreathe his last sigh.  But on such an occasion decency forbade that\r\npositive orders for departure should be passed from mouth to mouth.  The\r\nheads of the stables, therefore, agreed with the people who were in the\r\nKing’s room, that the latter should place a lighted taper near a window,\r\nand that at the instant of the King’s decease one of them should\r\nextinguish it.\r\n\r\nThe taper was extinguished.  On this signal the Body Guards, pages, and\r\nequerries mounted on horseback, and all was ready for setting off.  The\r\nDauphin was with the Dauphiness.  They were expecting together the\r\nintelligence of the death of Louis XV.  A dreadful noise, absolutely like\r\nthunder, was heard in the outer apartment; it was the crowd of courtiers\r\nwho were deserting the dead sovereign’s antechamber, to come and do homage\r\nto the new power of Louis XVI.  This extraordinary tumult informed Marie\r\nAntoinette and her husband that they were called to the throne; and, by a\r\nspontaneous movement, which deeply affected those around them, they threw\r\nthemselves on their knees; both, pouring forth a flood of tears,\r\nexclaimed: “O God! guide us, protect us; we are too young to reign.”\r\n\r\nThe Comtesse de Noailles entered, and was the first to salute Marie\r\nAntoinette as Queen of France.  She requested their Majesties to\r\ncondescend to quit the inner apartments for the grand salon, to receive\r\nthe Princes and all the great officers, who were desirous to do homage to\r\ntheir new sovereigns.  Marie Antoinette received these first visits\r\nleaning upon her husband, with her handkerchief held to her eyes; the\r\ncarriages drove up, the guards and equerries were on horseback.  The\r\nChateau was deserted; every one hastened to fly from contagion, which\r\nthere was no longer any inducement to brave.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the chamber of Louis XV., the Duc de Villequier, first\r\ngentleman of the bedchamber for the year, ordered M. Andouille, the King’s\r\nchief surgeon, to open the body and embalm it.  The chief surgeon would\r\ninevitably have died in consequence.  “I am ready,” replied Andouille;\r\n“but while I operate you shall hold the head; your office imposes this\r\nduty upon you.”  The Duke went off without saying a word, and the corpse\r\nwas neither opened nor embalmed.  A few under-servants and workmen\r\ncontinued with the pestiferous remains, and paid the last duty to their\r\nmaster; the surgeons directed that spirits of wine should be poured into\r\nthe coffin.\r\n\r\nThe entire Court set off for Choisy at four o’clock; Mesdames the King’s\r\naunts in their private carriage, and the Princesses under tuition with the\r\nComtesse de Marsan and the under-governesses.  The King, the Queen,\r\nMonsieur, the King’s brother, Madame, and the Comte and Comtesse d’Artois\r\nwent in the same carriage.  The solemn scene that had just passed before\r\ntheir eyes, the multiplied ideas offered to their imaginations by that\r\nwhich was just opening, had naturally inclined them to grief and\r\nreflection; but, by the Queen’s own confession, this inclination, little\r\nsuited to their age, wholly left them before they had gone half their\r\njourney; a word, drolly mangled by the Comtesse d’Artois, occasioned a\r\ngeneral burst of laughter; and from that moment they dried their tears.\r\n\r\nThe communication between Choisy and Paris was incessant; never was a\r\nCourt seen in greater agitation.  What influence will the royal aunts\r\nhave,--and the Queen?  What fate is reserved for the Comtesse du Barry?\r\nWhom will the young King choose for his ministers?  All these questions\r\nwere answered in a few days.  It was determined that the King’s youth\r\nrequired a confidential person near him; and that there should be a prime\r\nminister.  All eyes were turned upon De Machault and De Maurepas, both of\r\nthem much advanced in years.  The first had retired to his estate near\r\nParis; and the second to Pont Chartrain, to which place he had long been\r\nexiled.  The letter recalling M. de Machault was written, when Madame\r\nAdelaide obtained the preference of that important appointment for M. de\r\nMaurepas.  The page to whose care the first letter had been actually\r\nconsigned was recalled.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d’Aiguillon had been too openly known as the private friend of the\r\nKing’s mistress; he was dismissed.  M. de Vergennes, at that time\r\nambassador of France at Stockholm, was appointed Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs; Comte du Muy, the intimate friend of the Dauphin, the father of\r\nLouis XVI.[?? D.W.], obtained the War Department.  The Abbe Terray in vain\r\nsaid, and wrote, that he had boldly done all possible injury to the\r\ncreditors of the State during the reign of the late King; that order was\r\nrestored in the finances; that nothing but what was beneficial to all\r\nparties remained to be done; and that the new Court was about to enjoy the\r\nadvantages of the regenerating part of his plan of finance; all these\r\nreasons, set forth in five or six memorials, which he sent in succession\r\nto the King and Queen, did not avail to keep him in office.  His talents\r\nwere admitted, but the odium which his operations had necessarily brought\r\nupon his character, combined with the immorality of his private life,\r\nforbade his further stay at Court; he was succeeded by M. de Clugny.  De\r\nMaupeou, the chancellor, was exiled; this caused universal joy.  Lastly,\r\nthe reassembling of the Parliaments produced the strongest sensation;\r\nParis was in a delirium of joy, and not more than one person in a hundred\r\nforesaw that the spirit of the ancient magistracy would be still the same;\r\nand that in a short time it would make new attempts upon the royal\r\nauthority.  Madame du Barry had been exiled to Pont-aux-Dames.  This was a\r\nmeasure rather of necessity than of severity; a short period of compulsory\r\nretreat was requisite in order completely to break off her connections\r\nwith State affairs.  The possession of Louveciennes and a considerable\r\npension were continued to her.\r\n\r\n[The Comtesse du Barry never forgot the mild treatment she experienced\r\nfrom the Court of Louis XVI.; during the most violent convulsions of the\r\nRevolution she signified to the Queen that there was no one in France more\r\ngrieved at the sufferings of her sovereign than herself; that the honour\r\nshe had for years enjoyed, of living near the throne, and the unbounded\r\nkindness of the King and Queen, had so sincerely attached her to the cause\r\nof royalty that she entreated the Queen to honour her by disposing of all\r\nshe possessed. Though they did not accept her offer, their Majesties were\r\naffected at her gratitude.  The Comtesse du Barry was, as is well known,\r\none of the victims of the Revolution.  She betrayed at the last great\r\nweakness, and the most ardent desire to live.  She was the only woman who\r\nwept upon the scaffold and implored for mercy.  Her beauty and tears made\r\nan impression on the populace, and the execution was hurried to a\r\nconclusion.--MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nEverybody expected the recall of M. de Choiseul; the regret occasioned by\r\nhis absence among the numerous friends whom he had left at Court, the\r\nattachment of the young Princess who was indebted to him for her elevation\r\nto the throne of France, and all concurring circumstances, seemed to\r\nforetell his return; the Queen earnestly entreated it of the King, but she\r\nmet with an insurmountable and unforeseen obstacle.  The King, it is said,\r\nhad imbibed the strongest prejudices against that minister, from secret\r\nmemoranda penned by his father, and which had been committed to the care\r\nof the Duc de La Vauguyon, with an injunction to place them in his hands\r\nas soon as he should be old enough to study the art of reigning.  It was\r\nby these memoranda that the esteem which he had conceived for the Marechal\r\ndu Muy was inspired, and we may add that Madame Adelaide, who at this\r\nearly period powerfully influenced the decisions of the young monarch,\r\nconfirmed the impressions they had made.\r\n\r\nThe Queen conversed with M. Campan on the regret she felt at having been\r\nunable to procure the recall of M. de Choiseul, and disclosed the cause of\r\nit to him.  The Abbe de Vermond, who, down to the time of the death of\r\nLouis XV., had been on terms of the strictest friendship with M. Campan,\r\ncalled upon him on the second day after the arrival of the Court at\r\nChoisy, and, assuming a serious air, said, “Monsieur, the Queen was\r\nindiscreet enough yesterday to speak to you of a minister to whom she must\r\nof course be attached, and whom his friends ardently desire to have near\r\nher; you are aware that we must give up all expectation of seeing the Duke\r\nat Court; you know the reasons why; but you do not know that the young\r\nQueen, having mentioned the conversation in question to me, it was my\r\nduty, both as her preceptor and her friend, to remonstrate severely with\r\nher on her indiscretion in communicating to you those particulars of which\r\nyou are in possession.  I am now come to tell you that if you continue to\r\navail yourself of the good nature of your mistress to initiate yourself in\r\nsecrets of State, you will have me for your most inveterate enemy.  The\r\nQueen should find here no other confidant than myself respecting things\r\nthat ought to remain secret.”  M. Campan answered that he did not covet\r\nthe important and dangerous character at the new Court which the Abbe\r\nwished to appropriate; and that he should confine himself to the duties of\r\nhis office, being sufficiently satisfied with the continued kindness with\r\nwhich the Queen honoured him. Notwithstanding this, however, he informed\r\nthe Queen, on the very same evening, of the injunction he had received.\r\nShe owned that she had mentioned their conversation to the Abbe; that he\r\nhad indeed seriously scolded her, in order to make her feel the necessity\r\nof being secret in concerns of State; and she added, “The Abbe cannot like\r\nyou, my dear Campan; he did not expect that I should, on my arrival in\r\nFrance, find in my household a man who would suit me so exactly as you\r\nhave done.  I know that he has taken umbrage at it; that is enough.  I\r\nknow, too, that you are incapable of attempting anything to injure him in\r\nmy esteem; an attempt which would besides be vain, for I have been too\r\nlong attached to him.  As to yourself, be easy on the score of the Abbe’s\r\nhostility, which shall not in any way hurt you.”\r\n\r\nThe Abbe de Vermond having made himself master of the office of sole\r\nconfidant to the Queen, was nevertheless agitated whenever he saw the\r\nyoung King; he could not be ignorant that the Abbe had been promoted by\r\nthe Duc de Choiseul, and was believed to favour the Encyclopedists,\r\nagainst whom Louis XVI.  entertained a secret prejudice, although he\r\nsuffered them to gain so great an ascendency during his reign.  The Abbe\r\nhad, moreover, observed that the King had never, while Dauphin, addressed\r\na single word to him; and that he very frequently only answered him with a\r\nshrug of the shoulders.  He therefore determined on writing to Louis XVI.,\r\nand intimating that he owed his situation at Court solely to the\r\nconfidence with which the late King had honoured him; and that as habits\r\ncontracted during the Queen’s education placed him continually in the\r\nclosest intimacy with her, he could not enjoy the honour of remaining near\r\nher Majesty without the King’s consent.  Louis XVI. sent back his letter,\r\nafter writing upon it these words: “I approve the Abbe de Vermond\r\ncontinuing in his office about the Queen.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the period of his grandfather’s death, Louis XVI. began to be\r\nexceedingly attached to the Queen.  The first period of so deep a mourning\r\nnot admitting of indulgence in the diversion of hunting, he proposed to\r\nher walks in the gardens of Choisy; they went out like husband and wife,\r\nthe young King giving his arm to the Queen, and accompanied by a very\r\nsmall suite.  The influence of this example had such an effect upon the\r\ncourtiers that the next day several couples, who had long, and for good\r\nreasons, been disunited, were seen walking upon the terrace with the same\r\napparent conjugal intimacy.  Thus they spent whole hours, braving the\r\nintolerable wearisomeness of their protracted tete-a-tetes, out of mere\r\nobsequious imitation.\r\n\r\nThe devotion of Mesdames to the King their father throughout his dreadful\r\nmalady had produced that effect upon their health which was generally\r\napprehended.  On the fourth day after their arrival at Choisy they were\r\nattacked by pains in the head and chest, which left no doubt as to the\r\ndanger of their situation.  It became necessary instantly to send away the\r\nyoung royal family; and the Chateau de la Muette, in the Bois de Boulogne,\r\nwas selected for their reception.  Their arrival at that residence, which\r\nwas very near Paris, drew so great a concourse of people into its\r\nneighbourhood, that even at daybreak the crowd had begun to assemble round\r\nthe gates.  Shouts of “Vive le Roi!”  were scarcely interrupted for a\r\nmoment between six o’clock in the morning and sunset. The unpopularity the\r\nlate King, had drawn upon himself during his latter years, and the hopes\r\nto which a new reign gives birth, occasioned these transports of joy.\r\n\r\nA fashionable jeweller made a fortune by the sale of mourning snuff-boxes,\r\nwhereon the portrait of the young Queen, in a black frame of shagreen,\r\ngave rise to the pun: “Consolation in chagrin.”  All the fashions, and\r\nevery article of dress, received names expressing the spirit of the\r\nmoment.  Symbols of abundance were everywhere represented, and the\r\nhead-dresses of the ladies were surrounded by ears of wheat. Poets sang of\r\nthe new monarch; all hearts, or rather all heads, in France were filled\r\nwith enthusiasm.  Never did the commencement of any reign excite more\r\nunanimous testimonials of love and attachment.  It must be observed,\r\nhowever, that, amidst all this intoxication, the anti-Austrian party never\r\nlost sight of the young Queen, but kept on the watch, with the malicious\r\ndesire to injure her through such errors as might arise from her youth and\r\ninexperience.\r\n\r\nTheir Majesties had to receive at La Muette the condolences of the ladies\r\nwho had been presented at Court, who all felt themselves called on to pay\r\nhomage to the new sovereigns.  Old and young hastened to present\r\nthemselves on the day of general reception; little black bonnets with\r\ngreat wings, shaking heads, low curtsies, keeping time with the motions of\r\nthe head, made, it must be admitted, a few venerable dowagers appear\r\nsomewhat ridiculous; but the Queen, who possessed a great deal of dignity,\r\nand a high respect for decorum, was not guilty of the grave fault of\r\nlosing the state she was bound to preserve.  An indiscreet piece of\r\ndrollery of one of the ladies of the palace, however, procured her the\r\nimputation of doing so.  The Marquise de Clermont-Tonnerre, whose office\r\nrequired that she should continue standing behind the Queen, fatigued by\r\nthe length of the ceremony, seated herself on the floor, concealed behind\r\nthe fence formed by the hoops of the Queen and the ladies of the palace.\r\nThus seated, and wishing to attract attention and to appear lively, she\r\ntwitched the dresses of those ladies, and played a thousand other tricks.\r\nThe contrast of these childish pranks with the solemnity which reigned\r\nover the rest of the Queen’s chamber disconcerted her Majesty: she several\r\ntimes placed her fan before her face to hide an involuntary smile, and the\r\nsevere old ladies pronounced that the young Queen had decided all those\r\nrespectable persons who were pressing forward to pay their homage to her;\r\nthat she liked none but the young; that she was deficient in decorum; and\r\nthat not one of them would attend her Court again.  The epithet ‘moqueuse’\r\nwas applied to her; and there is no epithet less favourably received in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe next day a very ill-natured song was circulated; the stamp of the\r\nparty to which it was attributable might easily be seen upon it.  I\r\nremember only the following chorus:\r\n\r\n“Little Queen, you must not be\r\nSo saucy, with your twenty years;\r\nYour ill-used courtiers soon will see\r\nYou pass, once more, the barriers.\r\nFal lal lal, fal lal la.”\r\n\r\nThe errors of the great, or those which ill-nature chooses to impute to\r\nthem, circulate in the world with the greatest rapidity, and become\r\nhistorical traditions, which every one delights to repeat.\r\n\r\nMore than fifteen years after this occurrence I heard some old ladies in\r\nthe most retired part of Auvergne relating all the particulars of the day\r\nof public condolence for the late King, on which, as they said, the Queen\r\nhad laughed in the faces of the sexagenarian duchesses and princesses who\r\nhad thought it their duty to appear on the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe King and the Princes, his brothers, determined to avail themselves of\r\nthe advantages held out by inoculation, as a safeguard against the illness\r\nunder which their grandfather had just fallen; but the utility of this new\r\ndiscovery not being then generally acknowledged in France, many persons\r\nwere greatly alarmed at the step; those who blamed it openly threw all the\r\nresponsibility of it upon the Queen, who alone, they said, could have\r\nventured to give such rash advice, inoculation being at this time\r\nestablished in the Northern Courts.  The operation upon the King and his\r\nbrothers, performed by Doctor Jauberthou, was fortunately quite\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nWhen the convalescence of the Princes was perfectly established, the\r\nexcursions to Marly became cheerful enough.  Parties on horseback and in\r\ncalashes were formed continually.  The Queen was desirous to afford\r\nherself one very innocent gratification; she had never seen the day break;\r\nand having now no other consent than that of the King to seek, she\r\nintimated her wish to him.  He agreed that she should go, at three o’clock\r\nin the morning, to the eminences of the gardens of Marly; and,\r\nunfortunately, little disposed to partake in her amusements, he himself\r\nwent to bed.  Foreseeing some inconveniences possible in this nocturnal\r\nparty, the Queen determined on having a number of people with her; and\r\neven ordered her waiting women to accompany her.  All precautions were\r\nineffectual to prevent the effects of calumny, which thenceforward sought\r\nto diminish the general attachment that she had inspired.  A few days\r\nafterwards, the most wicked libel that appeared during the earlier years\r\nof her reign was circulated in Paris.  The blackest colours were employed\r\nto paint an enjoyment so harmless that there is scarcely a young woman\r\nliving in the country who has not endeavoured to procure it for herself.\r\nThe verses which appeared on this occasion were entitled “Sunrise.”\r\n\r\nThe Duc d’Orleans, then Duc de Chartres, was among those who accompanied\r\nthe young Queen in her nocturnal ramble: he appeared very attentive to her\r\nat this epoch; but it was the only moment of his life in which there was\r\nany advance towards intimacy between the Queen and himself.  The King\r\ndisliked the character of the Duc de Chartres, and the Queen always\r\nexcluded him from her private society.  It is therefore without the\r\nslightest foundation that some writers have attributed to feelings of\r\njealousy or wounded self-love the hatred which he displayed towards the\r\nQueen during the latter years of their existence.\r\n\r\nIt was on this first journey to Marly that Boehmer, the jeweller, appeared\r\nat Court,--a man whose stupidity and avarice afterwards fatally affected\r\nthe happiness and reputation of Marie Antoinette.  This person had, at\r\ngreat expense, collected six pear-formed diamonds of a prodigious size;\r\nthey were perfectly matched and of the finest water.  The earrings which\r\nthey composed had, before the death of Louis XV., been destined for the\r\nComtesse du Barry.\r\n\r\nBoehmer; by the recommendation of several persons about the Court, came to\r\noffer these jewels to the Queen.  He asked four hundred thousand francs\r\nfor them.  The young Princess could not withstand her wish to purchase\r\nthem; and the King having just raised the Queen’s income, which, under the\r\nformer reign, had been but two hundred thousand livres, to one hundred\r\nthousand crowns a year, she wished to make the purchase out of her own\r\npurse, and not burthen the royal treasury with the payment.  She proposed\r\nto Boehmer to take off the two buttons which formed the tops of the\r\nclusters, as they could be replaced by two of her own diamonds.  He\r\nconsented, and then reduced the price of the earrings to three hundred and\r\nsixty thousand francs; the payment for which was to be made by\r\ninstalments, and was discharged in the course of four or five years by the\r\nQueen’s first femme de chambre, deputed to manage the funds of her privy\r\npurse.  I have omitted no details as to the manner in which the Queen\r\nfirst became possessed of these jewels, deeming them very needful to place\r\nin its true light the too famous circumstance of the necklace, which\r\nhappened near the end of her reign.\r\n\r\nIt was also on this first journey to Marly that the Duchesse de Chartres,\r\nafterwards Duchesse d’Orleans, introduced into the Queen’s household\r\nMademoiselle Bertin, a milliner who became celebrated at that time for the\r\ntotal change she effected in the dress of the French ladies.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the mere admission of a milliner into the house of the\r\nQueen was followed by evil consequences to her Majesty.  The skill of the\r\nmilliner, who was received into the household, in spite of the custom\r\nwhich kept persons of her description out of it, afforded her the\r\nopportunity of introducing some new fashion every day.  Up to this time\r\nthe Queen had shown very plain taste in dress; she now began to make it a\r\nprincipal occupation; and she was of course imitated by other women.\r\n\r\nAll wished instantly to have the same dress as the Queen, and to wear the\r\nfeathers and flowers to which her beauty, then in its brilliancy, lent an\r\nindescribable charm.  The expenditure of the younger ladies was\r\nnecessarily much increased; mothers and husbands murmured at it; some few\r\ngiddy women contracted debts; unpleasant domestic scenes occurred; in many\r\nfamilies coldness or quarrels arose; and the general report was,--that the\r\nQueen would be the ruin of all the French ladies.\r\n\r\nFashion continued its fluctuating progress; and head-dresses, with their\r\nsuperstructures of gauze, flowers, and feathers, became so lofty that the\r\nwomen could not find carriages high enough to admit them; and they were\r\noften seen either stooping, or holding their heads out of the windows.\r\nOthers knelt down in order to manage these elevated objects of ridicule\r\nwith less danger.\r\n\r\n[If the use of these extravagant feathers and head-dresses had continued,\r\nsay the memoirs of that period very seriously, it would have effected a\r\nrevolution in architecture.  It would have been found necessary to raise\r\nthe doors and ceilings of the boxes at the theatre, and particularly the\r\nbodies of carriages.  It was not without mortification that the King\r\nobserved the Queen’s adoption of this style of dress: she was never so\r\nlovely in his eyes as when unadorned by art.  One day Carlin, performing\r\nat Court as harlequin, stuck in his hat, instead of the rabbit’s tail, its\r\nprescribed ornament, a peacock’s feather of excessive length.  This new\r\nappendage, which repeatedly got entangled among the scenery, gave him an\r\nopportunity for a great deal of buffoonery.  There was some inclination to\r\npunish him; but it was presumed that he had not assumed the feather\r\nwithout authority.-NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nInnumerable caricatures, exhibited in all directions, and some of which\r\nartfully gave the features of the Queen, attacked the extravagance of\r\nfashion, but with very little effect.  It changed only, as is always the\r\ncase, through the influence of inconstancy and time.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s toilet was a masterpiece of etiquette; everything was done in\r\na prescribed form.  Both the dame d’honneur and the dame d’atours usually\r\nattended and officiated, assisted by the first femme de chambre and two\r\nordinary women.  The dame d’atours put on the petticoat, and handed the\r\ngown to the Queen.  The dame d’honneur poured out the water for her hands\r\nand put on her linen.  When a princess of the royal family happened to be\r\npresent while the Queen was dressing, the dame d’honneur yielded to her\r\nthe latter act of office, but still did not yield it directly to the\r\nPrincesses of the blood; in such a case the dame d’honneur was accustomed\r\nto present the linen to the first femme de chambre, who, in her turn,\r\nhanded it to the Princess of the blood.  Each of these ladies observed\r\nthese rules scrupulously as affecting her rights.  One winter’s day it\r\nhappened that the Queen, who was entirely undressed, was just going to put\r\non her shift; I held it ready unfolded for her; the dame d’honneur came\r\nin, slipped off her gloves, and took it.  A scratching was heard at the\r\ndoor; it was opened, and in came the Duchesse d’Orleans: her gloves were\r\ntaken off, and she came forward to take the garment; but as it would have\r\nbeen wrong in the dame d’honneur to hand it to her she gave it to me, and\r\nI handed it to the Princess.  More scratching it was Madame la Comtesse de\r\nProvence; the Duchesse d’Orleans handed her the linen.  All this while the\r\nQueen kept her arms crossed upon her bosom, and appeared to feel cold;\r\nMadame observed her uncomfortable situation, and, merely laying down her\r\nhandkerchief without taking off her gloves, she put on the linen, and in\r\ndoing so knocked the Queen’s cap off.  The Queen laughed to conceal her\r\nimpatience, but not until she had muttered several times, “How\r\ndisagreeable!  how tiresome!”\r\n\r\nAll this etiquette, however inconvenient, was suitable to the royal\r\ndignity, which expects to find servants in all classes of persons,\r\nbeginning even with the brothers and sisters of the monarch.\r\n\r\nSpeaking here of etiquette, I do not allude to majestic state, appointed\r\nfor days of ceremony in all Courts.  I mean those minute ceremonies that\r\nwere pursued towards our Kings in their inmost privacies, in their hours\r\nof pleasure, in those of pain, and even during the most revolting of human\r\ninfirmities.\r\n\r\nThese servile rules were drawn up into a kind of code; they offered to a\r\nRichelieu, a La Rochefoucauld and a Duras, in the exercise of their\r\ndomestic functions, opportunities of intimacy useful to their interests;\r\nand their vanity was flattered by customs which converted the right to\r\ngive a glass of water, to put on a dress, and to remove a basin, into\r\nhonourable prerogatives.\r\n\r\nPrinces thus accustomed to be treated as divinities naturally ended by\r\nbelieving that they were of a distinct nature, of a purer essence than the\r\nrest of mankind.\r\n\r\nThis sort of etiquette, which led our Princes to be treated in private as\r\nidols, made them in public martyrs to decorum.  Marie Antoinette found in\r\nthe Chateau of Versailles a multitude of established customs which\r\nappeared to her insupportable.\r\n\r\nThe ladies-in-waiting, who were all obliged to be sworn, and to wear full\r\nCourt dresses, were alone entitled to remain in the room, and to attend in\r\nconjunction with the dame d’honneur and the tirewoman.  The Queen\r\nabolished all this formality.  When her head was dressed, she curtsied to\r\nall the ladies who were in her chamber, and, followed only by her own\r\nwomen, went into her closet, where Mademoiselle Bertin, who could not be\r\nadmitted into the chamber, used to await her.  It was in this inner closet\r\nthat she produced her new and numerous dresses.  The Queen was also\r\ndesirous of being served by the most fashionable hairdresser in Paris.\r\nNow the custom which forbade all persons in inferior offices, employed by\r\nroyalty, to exert their talents for the public, was no doubt intended to\r\ncut off all communication between the privacy of princes and society at\r\nlarge; the latter being always extremely curious respecting the most\r\ntrifling particulars relative to the private life of the former. The\r\nQueen, fearing that the taste of the hairdresser would suffer if he should\r\ndiscontinue the general practice of his art, ordered him to attend as\r\nusual certain ladies of the Court and of Paris; and this multiplied the\r\nopportunities of learning details respecting the household, and very often\r\nof misrepresenting them.\r\n\r\nOne of the customs most disagreeable to the Queen was that of dining every\r\nday in public.  Maria Leczinska had always submitted to this wearisome\r\npractice; Marie Antoinette followed it as long as she was Dauphiness.  The\r\nDauphin dined with her, and each branch of the family had its public\r\ndinner daily.  The ushers suffered all decently dressed people to enter;\r\nthe sight was the delight of persons from the country. At the dinner-hour\r\nthere were none to be met upon the stairs but honest folks, who, after\r\nhaving seen the Dauphiness take her soup, went to see the Princes eat\r\ntheir ‘bouilli’, and then ran themselves out of breath to behold Mesdames\r\nat their dessert.\r\n\r\nVery ancient usage, too, required that the Queens of France should appear\r\nin public surrounded only by women; even at meal-times no persons of the\r\nother sex attended to serve at table; and although the King ate publicly\r\nwith the Queen, yet he himself was served by women with everything which\r\nwas presented to him directly at table.  The dame d’honneur, kneeling, for\r\nher own accommodation, upon a low stool, with a napkin upon her arm, and\r\nfour women in full dress, presented the plates to the King and Queen. The\r\ndame d’honneur handed them drink.  This service had formerly been the\r\nright of the maids of honour.  The Queen, upon her accession to the\r\nthrone, abolished the usage altogether.  She also freed herself from the\r\nnecessity of being followed in the Palace of Versailles by two of her\r\nwomen in Court dresses, during those hours of the day when the\r\nladies-in-waiting were not with her.  From that time she was accompanied\r\nonly by a single valet de chambre and two footmen.  All the changes made\r\nby Marie Antoinette were of the same description; a disposition gradually\r\nto substitute the simple customs of Vienna for those of Versailles was\r\nmore injurious to her than she could possibly have imagined.\r\n\r\nWhen the King slept in the Queen’s apartment he always rose before her;\r\nthe exact hour was communicated to the head femme de chambre, who entered,\r\npreceded by a servant of the bedchamber bearing a taper; she crossed the\r\nroom and unbolted the door which separated the Queen’s apartment from that\r\nof the King.  She there found the first valet de chambre for the quarter,\r\nand a servant of the chamber.  They entered, opened the bed curtains on\r\nthe King’s side, and presented him slippers generally, as well as the\r\ndressing-gown, which he put on, of gold or silver stuff.  The first valet\r\nde chambre took down a short sword which was always laid within the\r\nrailing on the King’s side.  When the King slept with the Queen, this\r\nsword was brought upon the armchair appropriated to the King, and which\r\nwas placed near the Queen’s bed, within the gilt railing which surrounded\r\nthe bed.  The first femme de chambre conducted the King to the door,\r\nbolted it again, and, leaving the Queen’s chamber, did not return until\r\nthe hour appointed by her Majesty the evening before.  At night the Queen\r\nwent to bed before the King; the first femme de chambre remained seated at\r\nthe foot of her bed until the arrival of his Majesty, in order, as in the\r\nmorning, to see the King’s attendants out and bolt the door after them.\r\nThe Queen awoke habitually at eight o’clock, and breakfasted at nine,\r\nfrequently in bed, and sometimes after she had risen, at a table placed\r\nopposite her couch.\r\n\r\nIn order to describe the Queen’s private service intelligibly, it must be\r\nrecollected that service of every kind was honour, and had not any other\r\ndenomination.  To do the honours of the service was to present the service\r\nto a person of superior rank, who happened to arrive at the moment it was\r\nabout to be performed.  Thus, supposing the Queen asked for a glass of\r\nwater, the servant of the chamber handed to the first woman a silver gilt\r\nwaiter, upon which were placed a covered goblet and a small decanter; but\r\nshould the lady of honour come in, the first woman was obliged to present\r\nthe waiter to her, and if Madame or the Comtesse d’Artois came in at the\r\nmoment, the waiter went again from the lady of honour into the hands of\r\nthe Princess before it reached the Queen.  It must be observed, however,\r\nthat if a princess of the blood instead of a princess of the family\r\nentered, the service went directly from the first woman to the princess of\r\nthe blood, the lady of honour being excused from transferring to any but\r\nprincesses of the royal family.  Nothing was presented directly to the\r\nQueen; her handkerchief or her gloves were placed upon a long salver of\r\ngold or silver gilt, which was placed as a piece of furniture of ceremony\r\nupon a side-table, and was called a gantiere.  The first woman presented\r\nto her in this manner all that she asked for, unless the tirewoman, the\r\nlady of honour, or a princess were present, and then the gradation pointed\r\nout in the instance of the glass of water was always observed.\r\n\r\nWhether the Queen breakfasted in bed or up, those entitled to the petites\r\nentrees were equally admitted; this privilege belonged of right to her\r\nchief physician, chief surgeon, physician in ordinary, reader, closet\r\nsecretary, the King’s four first valets de chambre and their reversioners,\r\nand the King’s chief physicians and surgeons.  There were frequently from\r\nten to twelve persons at this first entree.  The lady of honour or the\r\nsuperintendent, if present, placed the breakfast equipage upon the bed;\r\nthe Princesse de Lamballe frequently performed that office.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Queen rose, the wardrobe woman was admitted to take away\r\nthe pillows and prepare the bed to be made by some of the valets de\r\nchambre.  She undrew the curtains, and the bed was not generally made\r\nuntil the Queen was gone to mass.  Generally, excepting at St.  Cloud,\r\nwhere the Queen bathed in an apartment below her own, a slipper bath was\r\nrolled into her room, and her bathers brought everything that was\r\nnecessary for the bath.  The Queen bathed in a large gown of English\r\nflannel buttoned down to the bottom; its sleeves throughout, as well as\r\nthe collar, were lined with linen.  When she came out of the bath the\r\nfirst woman held up a cloth to conceal her entirely from the sight of her\r\nwomen, and then threw it over her shoulders.  The bathers wrapped her in\r\nit and dried her completely.  She then put on a long and wide open\r\nchemise, entirely trimmed with lace, and afterwards a white taffety\r\nbed-gown.  The wardrobe woman warmed the bed; the slippers were of dimity,\r\ntrimmed with lace.  Thus dressed, the Queen went to bed again, and the\r\nbathers and servants of the chamber took away the bathing apparatus.  The\r\nQueen, replaced in bed, took a book or her tapestry work.  On her bathing\r\nmornings she breakfasted in the bath.  The tray was placed on the cover of\r\nthe bath.  These minute details are given here only to do justice to the\r\nQueen’s scrupulous modesty.  Her temperance was equally remarkable; she\r\nbreakfasted on coffee or chocolate; at dinner ate nothing but white meat,\r\ndrank water only, and supped on broth, a wing of a fowl, and small\r\nbiscuits, which she soaked in a glass of water.\r\n\r\nThe tirewoman had under her order a principal under-tirewoman, charged\r\nwith the care and preservation of all the Queen’s dresses; two women to\r\nfold and press such articles as required it; two valets, and a porter of\r\nthe wardrobe.  The latter brought every morning into the Queen’s\r\napartments baskets covered with taffety, containing all that she was to\r\nwear during the day, and large cloths of green taffety covering the robes\r\nand the full dresses.  The valet of the wardrobe on duty presented every\r\nmorning a large book to the first femme de chambre, containing patterns of\r\nthe gowns, full dresses, undresses, etc.  Every pattern was marked, to\r\nshow to which sort it belonged.  The first femme de chambre presented this\r\nbook to the Queen on her awaking, with a pincushion; her Majesty stuck\r\npins in those articles which she chose for the day,--one for the dress,\r\none for the afternoon-undress, and one for the full evening dress for card\r\nor supper parties in the private apartments.  The book was then taken back\r\nto the wardrobe, and all that was wanted for the day was soon after\r\nbrought in in large taffety wrappers.  The wardrobe woman, who had the\r\ncare of the linen, in her turn brought in a covered basket containing two\r\nor three chemises and handkerchiefs.  The morning basket was called pret\r\ndu jour.  In the evening she brought in one containing the nightgown and\r\nnightcap, and the stockings for the next morning; this basket was called\r\npret de la nuit.  They were in the department of the lady of honour, the\r\ntirewoman having nothing to do with the linen.  Nothing was put in order\r\nor taken care of by the Queen’s women.  As soon as the toilet was over,\r\nthe valets and porter belonging to the wardrobe were called in, and they\r\ncarried all away in a heap, in the taffety wrappers, to the tirewoman’s\r\nwardrobe, where all were folded up again, hung up, examined, and cleaned\r\nwith so much regularity and care that even the cast-off clothes scarcely\r\nlooked as if they had been worn.  The tirewoman’s wardrobe consisted of\r\nthree large rooms surrounded with closets, some furnished with drawers and\r\nothers with shelves; there were also large tables in each of these rooms,\r\non which the gowns and dresses were spread out and folded up.\r\n\r\nFor the winter the Queen had generally twelve full dresses, twelve\r\nundresses called fancy dresses, and twelve rich hoop petticoats for the\r\ncard and supper parties in the smaller apartments.\r\n\r\nShe had as many for the summer; those for the spring served likewise for\r\nthe autumn.  All these dresses were discarded at the end of each season,\r\nunless, indeed, she retained some that she particularly liked.  I am not\r\nspeaking of muslin or cambric gowns, or others of the same kind--they were\r\nlately introduced; but such as these were not renewed at each returning\r\nseason, they were kept several years.  The chief women were charged with\r\nthe care and examination of the diamonds; this important duty was formerly\r\nconfided to the tirewoman, but for many years had been included in the\r\nbusiness of the first femmes de chambre.\r\n\r\nThe public toilet took place at noon.  The toilet-table was drawn forward\r\ninto the middle of the room.  This piece of furniture was generally the\r\nrichest and most ornamented of all in the apartment of the Princesses. The\r\nQueen used it in the same manner and place for undressing herself in the\r\nevening.  She went to bed in corsets trimmed with ribbon, and sleeves\r\ntrimmed with lace, and wore a large neck handkerchief.  The Queen’s\r\ncombing cloth was presented by her first woman if she was alone at the\r\ncommencement of the toilet; or, as well as the other articles, by the\r\nladies of honour if they were come.  At noon the women who had been in\r\nattendance four and twenty hours were relieved by two women in full dress;\r\nthe first woman went also to dress herself.  The grandee entrees were\r\nadmitted during the toilet; sofas were placed in circles for the\r\nsuperintendent, the ladies of honour, and tirewomen, and the governess of\r\nthe children of France when she came there; the duties of the ladies of\r\nthe bedchamber, having nothing to do with any kind of domestic or private\r\nfunctions, did not begin until the hour of going out to mass; they waited\r\nin the great closet, and entered when the toilet was over.  The Princes of\r\nthe blood, captains of the Guards, and all great officers having the entry\r\npaid their court at the hour of the toilet.  The Queen saluted by nodding\r\nher head or bending her body, or leaning upon her toilet-table as if\r\nmoving to rise; the last mode of salutation was for the Princes of the\r\nblood.  The King’s brothers also came very generally to pay their respects\r\nto her Majesty while her hair was being dressed.  In the earlier years of\r\nthe reign the first part of the dressing was performed in the bedchamber\r\nand according to the laws of etiquette; that is to say, the lady of honour\r\nput on the chemise and poured out the water for the hands, the tirewoman\r\nput on the skirt of the gown or full dress, adjusted the handkerchief, and\r\ntied on the necklace.  But when the young Queen became more seriously\r\ndevoted to fashion, and the head-dress attained so extravagant a height\r\nthat it became necessary to put on the chemise from below,--when, in\r\nshort, she determined to have her milliner, Mademoiselle Benin, with her\r\nwhilst she was dressing, whom the ladies would have refused to admit to\r\nany share in the honour of attending on the Queen, the dressing in the\r\nbedchamber was discontinued, and the Queen, leaving her toilet, withdrew\r\ninto her closet to dress.\r\n\r\nOn returning into her chamber, the Queen, standing about the middle of it,\r\nsurrounded by the superintendent, the ladies of honour and tirewomen, her\r\nladies of the palace, the chevalier d’honneur, the chief equerry, her\r\nclergy ready to attend her to mass, and the Princesses of the royal family\r\nwho happened to come, accompanied by all their chief attendants and\r\nladies, passed in order into the gallery as in going to mass.  The Queen’s\r\nsignatures were generally given at the moment of entry into the chamber.\r\nThe secretary for orders presented the pen.  Presentations of colonels on\r\ntaking leave were usually made at this time.  Those of ladies, and, such\r\nas had a right to the tabouret, or sitting in the royal presence, were\r\nmade on Sunday evenings before card-playing began, on their coming in from\r\npaying their respects.  Ambassadors were introduced to the Queen on\r\nTuesday mornings, accompanied by the introducer of ambassadors on duty,\r\nand by M. de Sequeville, the secretary for the ambassadors.  The\r\nintroducer in waiting usually came to the Queen at her toilet to apprise\r\nher of the presentations of foreigners which would be made.  The usher of\r\nthe chamber, stationed at the entrance, opened the folding doors to none\r\nbut the Princes and Princesses of the royal family, and announced them\r\naloud.  Quitting his post, he came forward to name to the lady of honour\r\nthe persons who came to be presented, or who came to take leave; that lady\r\nagain named them to the Queen at the moment they saluted her; if she and\r\nthe tirewoman were absent, the first woman took the place and did that\r\nduty.  The ladies of the bedchamber, chosen solely as companions for the\r\nQueen, had no domestic duties to fulfil, however opinion might dignify\r\nsuch offices.  The King’s letter in appointing them, among other\r\ninstructions of etiquette, ran thus: “having chosen you to bear the Queen\r\ncompany.”  There were hardly any emoluments accruing from this place.\r\n\r\nThe Queen heard mass with the King in the tribune, facing the grand altar\r\nand the choir, with the exception of the days of high ceremony, when their\r\nchairs were placed below upon velvet carpets fringed with gold. These days\r\nwere marked by the name of grand chapel day.\r\n\r\nThe Queen named the collector beforehand, and informed her of it through\r\nher lady of honour, who was besides desired to send the purse to her. The\r\ncollectors were almost always chosen from among those who had been\r\nrecently presented.  After returning from mass the Queen dined every\r\nSunday with the King only, in public in the cabinet of the nobility, a\r\nroom leading to her chamber.  Titled ladies having the honours sat during\r\nthe dinner upon folding-chairs placed on each side of the table.  Ladies\r\nwithout titles stood round the table; the captain of the Guards and the\r\nfirst gentleman of the chamber were behind the King’s chair; behind that\r\nof the Queen were her first maitre d’hotel, her chevalier d’honneur, and\r\nthe chief equerry.  The Queen’s maitre d’hotel was furnished with a large\r\nstaff, six or seven feet in length, ornamented with golden fleurs-de-lis,\r\nand surmounted by fleurs-de-lis in the form of a crown.  He entered the\r\nroom with this badge of his office to announce that the Queen was served.\r\nThe comptroller put into his hands the card of the dinner; in the absence\r\nof the maitre d’hotel he presented it to the Queen himself, otherwise he\r\nonly did him the honours of the service.  The maitre d’hotel did not leave\r\nhis place, he merely gave the orders for serving up and removing; the\r\ncomptroller and gentlemen serving placed the various dishes upon the\r\ntable, receiving them from the inferior servants.\r\n\r\nThe Prince nearest to the crown presented water to wash the King’s hands\r\nat the moment he placed himself at table, and a princess did the same\r\nservice to the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe table service was formerly performed for the Queen by the lady of\r\nhonour and four women in full dress; this part of the women’s service was\r\ntransferred to them on the suppression of the office of maids of honour.\r\nThe Queen put an end to this etiquette in the first year of her reign.\r\nWhen the dinner was over the Queen returned without the King to her\r\napartment with her women, and took off her hoop and train.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate Princess, against whom the opinions of the French people\r\nwere at length so much excited, possessed qualities which deserved to\r\nobtain the greatest popularity.  None could doubt this who, like myself,\r\nhad heard her with delight describe the patriarchal manners of the House\r\nof Lorraine.  She was accustomed to say that, by transplanting their\r\nmanners into Austria, the Princes of that house had laid the foundation of\r\nthe unassailable popularity enjoyed by the imperial family.  She\r\nfrequently related to me the interesting manner in which the Ducs de\r\nLorraine levied the taxes.  “The sovereign Prince,” said she, “went to\r\nchurch; after the sermon he rose, waved his hat in the air, to show that\r\nhe was about to speak, and then mentioned the sum whereof he stood in\r\nneed.  Such was the zeal of the good Lorrainers that men have been known\r\nto take away linen or household utensils without the knowledge of their\r\nwives, and sell them to add the value to their contribution.  It sometimes\r\nhappened, too, that the Prince received more money than he had asked for,\r\nin which case he restored the surplus.”\r\n\r\nAll who were acquainted with the Queen’s private qualities knew that she\r\nequally deserved attachment and esteem.  Kind and patient to excess in her\r\nrelations with her household, she indulgently considered all around her,\r\nand interested herself in their fortunes and in their pleasures., She had,\r\namong her women, young girls from the Maison de St. Cyr, all well born;\r\nthe Queen forbade them the play when the performances were not suitable;\r\nsometimes, when old plays were to be represented, if she found she could\r\nnot with certainty trust to her memory, she would take the trouble to read\r\nthem in the morning, to enable her to decide whether the girls should or\r\nshould not go to see them,--rightly considering herself bound to watch\r\nover their morals and conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the first few months of his reign Louis XVI. dwelt at La Muette,\r\nMarly, and Compiegne.  When settled at Versailles he occupied himself with\r\na general examination of his grandfather’s papers.  He had promised the\r\nQueen to communicate to her all that he might discover relative to the\r\nhistory of the man with the iron mask, who, he thought, had become so\r\ninexhaustible a source of conjecture only in consequence of the interest\r\nwhich the pen of a celebrated writer had excited respecting the detention\r\nof a prisoner of State, who was merely a man of whimsical tastes and\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nI was with the Queen when the King, having finished his researches,\r\ninformed her that he had not found anything among the secret papers\r\nelucidating the existence of this prisoner; that he had conversed on the\r\nmatter with M. de Maurepas, whose age made him contemporary with the epoch\r\nduring which the story must have been known to the ministers; and that M.\r\nde Maurepas had assured him he was merely a prisoner of a very dangerous\r\ncharacter, in consequence of his disposition for intrigue. He was a\r\nsubject of the Duke of Mantua, and was enticed to the frontier, arrested\r\nthere, and kept prisoner, first at Pignerol, and afterwards in the\r\nBastille.  This transfer took place in consequence of the appointment of\r\nthe governor of the former place to the government of the latter. It was\r\nfor fear the prisoner should profit by the inexperience of a new governor\r\nthat he was sent with the Governor of Pignerol to the Bastille.\r\n\r\nSuch was, in fact, the truth about the man on whom people have been\r\npleased to fix an iron mask.  And thus was it related in writing, and\r\npublished by M. ----- twenty years ago.  He had searched the archives of\r\nthe Foreign Office, and laid the real story before the public; but the\r\npublic, prepossessed in favour of a marvellous version, would not\r\nacknowledge the authenticity of his account.  Every man relied upon the\r\nauthority of Voltaire; and it was believed that a natural or a twin\r\nbrother of Louis XIV. lived many years in prison with a mask over his\r\nface.  The story of this mask, perhaps, had its origin in the old custom,\r\namong both men and women in Italy, of wearing a velvet mask when they\r\nexposed themselves to the sun.  It is possible that the Italian captive\r\nmay have sometimes shown himself upon the terrace of his prison with his\r\nface thus covered.  As to the silver plate which this celebrated prisoner\r\nis said to have thrown from his window, it is known that such a\r\ncircumstance did happen, but it happened at Valzin, in the time of\r\nCardinal Richelieu.  This anecdote has been mixed up with the inventions\r\nrespecting the Piedmontese prisoner.\r\n\r\nIn this survey of the papers of Louis XV. by his grandson some very\r\ncurious particulars relative to his private treasury were found.  Shares\r\nin various financial companies afforded him a revenue, and had in course\r\nof time produced him a capital of some amount, which he applied to his\r\nsecret expenses.  The King collected his vouchers of title to these\r\nshares, and made a present of them to M. Thierry de Ville d’Avray, his\r\nchief valet de chambre.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was desirous to secure the comfort of Mesdames, the daughters of\r\nLouis XV., who were held in the highest respect.  About this period she\r\ncontributed to furnish them with a revenue sufficient to provide them an\r\neasy, pleasant existence: The King gave them the Chateau of Bellevue; and\r\nadded to the produce of it, which was given up to them, the expenses of\r\ntheir table and equipage, and payment of all the charges of their\r\nhousehold, the number of which was even increased.  During the lifetime of\r\nLouis XV., who was a very selfish prince, his daughters, although they had\r\nattained forty years of age, had no other place of residence than their\r\napartments in the Chateau of Versailles; no other walks than such as they\r\ncould take in the large park of that palace; and no other means of\r\ngratifying their taste for the cultivation of plants but by having boxes\r\nand vases, filled with them, in their balconies or their closets. They\r\nhad, therefore, reason to be much pleased with the conduct of Marie\r\nAntoinette, who had the greatest influence in the King’s kindness towards\r\nhis aunts.\r\n\r\nParis did not cease, during the first years of the reign, to give proofs\r\nof pleasure whenever the Queen appeared at any of the plays of the\r\ncapital.  At the representation of “Iphigenia in Aulis,” the actor who\r\nsang the words, “Let us sing, let us celebrate our Queen!”  which were\r\nrepeated by the chorus, directed by a respectful movement the eyes of the\r\nwhole assembly upon her Majesty.  Reiterated cries of ‘Bis’! and clapping\r\nof hands, were followed by such a burst of enthusiasm that many of the\r\naudience added their voices to those of the actors in order to celebrate,\r\nit might too truly be said, another Iphigenia.  The Queen, deeply\r\naffected, covered her eyes with her handkerchief; and this proof of\r\nsensibility raised the public enthusiasm to a still higher pitch.\r\n\r\nThe King gave Marie Antoinette Petit Trianon.\r\n\r\n[The Chateau of Petit Trianon, which was built for Louis XV., was not\r\nremarkably handsome as a building.  The luxuriance of the hothouses\r\nrendered the place agreeable to that Prince.  He spent a few days there\r\nseveral times in the year.  It was when he was setting off from Versailles\r\nfor Petit Trianon that he was struck in the side by the knife of Damiens,\r\nand it was there that he was attacked by the smallpox, of which he died on\r\nthe 10th of May, 1774.--MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nHenceforward she amused herself with improving the gardens, without\r\nallowing any addition to the building, or any change in the furniture,\r\nwhich was very shabby, and remained, in 1789, in the same state as during\r\nthe reign of Louis XV.  Everything there, without exception, was\r\npreserved; and the Queen slept in a faded bed, which had been used by the\r\nComtesse du Barry.  The charge of extravagance, generally made against the\r\nQueen, is the most unaccountable of all the popular errors respecting her\r\ncharacter.  She had exactly the contrary failing; and I could prove that\r\nshe often carried her economy to a degree of parsimony actually blamable,\r\nespecially in a sovereign.  She took a great liking for Trianon, and used\r\nto go there alone, followed by a valet; but she found attendants ready to\r\nreceive her,--a concierge and his wife, who served her as femme de\r\nchambre, women of the wardrobe, footmen, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen she first took possession of Petit Trianon, it was reported that she\r\nchanged the name of the seat which the King had given her, and called it\r\nLittle Vienna, or Little Schoenbrunn.  A person who belonged to the Court,\r\nand was silly enough to give this report credit, wishing to visit Petit\r\nTrianon with a party, wrote to M. Campan, requesting the Queen’s\r\npermission to do so.  In his note he called Trianon Little Vienna. Similar\r\nrequests were usually laid before the Queen just as they were made: she\r\nchose to give the permissions to see her gardens herself, liking to grant\r\nthese little favours.  When she came to the words I have quoted she was\r\nvery, much offended, and exclaimed, angrily, that there were too many,\r\nfools ready, to aid the malicious; that she had been told of the report\r\ncirculated, which pretended that she had thought of nothing but her own\r\ncountry, and that she kept an Austrian heart, while the interests of\r\nFrance alone ought to engage her.  She refused the request so awkwardly\r\nmade, and desired M. Campan to reply, that Trianon was not to be seen for\r\nsome time, and that the Queen was astonished that any man in good society\r\nshould believe she would do so ill-judged a thing as to change the French\r\nnames of her palaces to foreign ones.\r\n\r\nBefore the Emperor Joseph II’s first visit to France the Queen received a\r\nvisit from the Archduke Maximilian in 1775.  A stupid act of the\r\nambassador, seconded on the part of the Queen by the Abbe de Vermond, gave\r\nrise at that period to a discussion which offended the Princes of the\r\nblood and the chief nobility of the kingdom.  Travelling incognito, the\r\nyoung Prince claimed that the first visit was not due from him to the\r\nPrinces of the blood; and the Queen supported his pretension.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the Regency, and on account of the residence of the\r\nfamily of Orleans in the bosom of the capital, Paris had preserved a\r\nremarkable degree of attachment and respect for that branch of the royal\r\nhouse; and although the crown was becoming more and more remote from the\r\nPrinces of the House of Orleans, they had the advantage (a great one with\r\nthe Parisians) of being the descendants of Henri IV.  An affront to that\r\npopular family was a serious ground of dislike to the Queen.  It was at\r\nthis period that the circles of the city, and even of the Court, expressed\r\nthemselves bitterly about her levity, and her partiality for the House of\r\nAustria.  The Prince for whom the Queen had embarked in an important\r\nfamily quarrel--and a quarrel involving national prerogatives--was,\r\nbesides, little calculated to inspire interest.  Still young, uninformed,\r\nand deficient in natural talent, he was always making blunders.\r\n\r\nHe went to the Jardin du Roi; M. de Buffon, who received him there,\r\noffered him a copy of his works; the Prince declined accepting the book,\r\nsaying to M. de Buffon, in the most polite manner possible, “I should be\r\nvery sorry to deprive you of it.”\r\n\r\n[Joseph II, on his visit to France, also went to see M. de Buffon, and\r\nsaid to that celebrated man, “I am come to fetch the copy of your works\r\nwhich my brother forgot.”--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that the Parisians were much entertained with this\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was exceedingly mortified at the mistakes made by her brother;\r\nbut what hurt her most was being accused of preserving an Austrian heart.\r\nMarie Antoinette had more than once to endure that imputation during the\r\nlong course of her misfortunes.  Habit did not stop the tears such\r\ninjustice caused; but the first time she was suspected of not loving\r\nFrance, she gave way to her indignation.  All that she could say on the\r\nsubject was useless; by seconding the pretensions of the Archduke she had\r\nput arms into her enemies’ hands; they were labouring to deprive her of\r\nthe love of the people, and endeavoured, by all possible means, to spread\r\na belief that the Queen sighed for Germany, and preferred that country to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette had none but herself to rely on for preserving the fickle\r\nsmiles of the Court and the public.  The King, too indifferent to serve\r\nher as a guide, as yet had conceived no love for her, notwithstanding the\r\nintimacy that grew between them at Choisy.  In his closet Louis XVI. was\r\nimmersed in deep study.  At the Council he was busied with the welfare of\r\nhis people; hunting and mechanical occupations engrossed his leisure\r\nmoments, and he never thought on the subject of an heir.\r\n\r\nThe coronation took place at Rheims, with all the accustomed pomp.  At\r\nthis period the people’s love for Louis XVI.  burst forth in transports\r\nnot to be mistaken for party demonstrations or idle curiosity.  He replied\r\nto this enthusiasm by marks of confidence, worthy of a people happy in\r\nbeing governed by a good King; he took a pleasure in repeatedly walking\r\nwithout guards, in the midst of the crowd which pressed around him, and\r\ncalled down blessings on his head.  I remarked the impression made at this\r\ntime by an observation of Louis XVI.  On the day of his coronation he put\r\nhis hand up to his head, at the moment of the crown being placed upon it,\r\nand said, “It pinches me.”  Henri III. had exclaimed, “It pricks me.”\r\n Those who were near the King were struck with the similarity between these\r\ntwo exclamations, though not of a class likely to be blinded by the\r\nsuperstitious fears of ignorance.\r\n\r\nWhile the Queen, neglected as she was, could not even hope for the\r\nhappiness of being a mother, she had the mortification of seeing the\r\nComtesse d’Artois give birth to the Duc d’Angouleme.\r\n\r\nCustom required that the royal family and the whole Court should be\r\npresent at the accouchement of the Princesses; the Queen was therefore\r\nobliged to stay a whole day in her sister-in-law’s chamber.  The moment\r\nthe Comtesse d’Artois was informed a prince was born, she put her hand to\r\nher forehead and exclaimed with energy, “My God, how happy I am!”  The\r\nQueen felt very differently at this involuntary and natural exclamation.\r\nNevertheless, her behaviour was perfect.  She bestowed all possible marks\r\nof tenderness upon the young mother, and would not leave her until she was\r\nagain put into bed; she afterwards passed along the staircase, and through\r\nthe hall of the guards, with a calm demeanour, in the midst of an immense\r\ncrowd.  The poissardes, who had assumed a right of speaking to sovereigns\r\nin their own vulgar language, followed her to the very doors of her\r\napartments, calling out to her with gross expressions, that she ought to\r\nproduce heirs.  The Queen reached her inner room, hurried and agitated; he\r\nshut herself up to weep with me alone, not from jealousy of her\r\nsister-in-law’s happiness,--of that he was incapable,--but from sorrow at\r\nher own situation.\r\n\r\nDeprived of the happiness of giving an heir to the crown, the Queen\r\nendeavoured to interest herself in the children of the people of her\r\nhousehold.  She had long been desirous to bring up one of them herself,\r\nand to make it the constant object of her care.  A little village boy,\r\nfour or five years old, full of health, with a pleasing countenance,\r\nremarkably large blue eyes, and fine light hair, got under the feet of the\r\nQueen’s horses, when she was taking an airing in a calash, through the\r\nhamlet of St. Michel, near Louveciennes.  The coachman and postilions\r\nstopped the horses, and the child was rescued without the slightest\r\ninjury.  Its grandmother rushed out of the door of her cottage to take it;\r\nbut the Queen, standing up in her calash and extending her arms, called\r\nout that the child was hers, and that destiny had given it to her, to\r\nconsole her, no doubt, until she should have the happiness of having one\r\nherself.  “Is his mother alive?” asked the Queen.  “No, Madame; my\r\ndaughter died last winter, and left five small children upon my hands.” “I\r\nwill take this one, and provide for all the rest; do you consent?” “Ah,\r\nMadame, they are too fortunate,” replied the cottager; “but Jacques is a\r\nbad boy.  I hope he will stay with you!”  The Queen, taking little Jacques\r\nupon her knee, said that she would make him used to her, and gave orders\r\nto proceed.  It was necessary, however, to shorten the drive, so violently\r\ndid Jacques scream, and kick the Queen and her ladies.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of her Majesty at her apartments at Versailles, holding the\r\nlittle rustic by the hand, astonished the whole household; he cried out\r\nwith intolerable shrillness that he wanted his grandmother, his brother\r\nLouis, and his sister Marianne; nothing could calm him.  He was taken away\r\nby the wife of a servant, who was appointed to attend him as nurse. The\r\nother children were put to school.  Little Jacques, whose family name was\r\nArmand, came back to the Queen two days afterwards; a white frock trimmed\r\nwith lace, a rose-coloured sash with silver fringe, and a hat decorated\r\nwith feathers, were now substituted for the woollen cap, the little red\r\nfrock, and the wooden shoes.  The child was really very beautiful.  The\r\nQueen was enchanted with him; he was brought to her every morning at nine\r\no’clock; he breakfasted and dined with her, and often even with the King.\r\nShe liked to call him my child, and lavished caresses upon him, still\r\nmaintaining a deep silence respecting the regrets which constantly\r\noccupied her heart.\r\n\r\n[This little unfortunate was nearly twenty in 1792; the fury of the people\r\nand the fear of being thought a favourite of the Queen’s had made him the\r\nmost sanguinary terrorist of Versailles.  He was killed at the battle of\r\nJemappes.]\r\n\r\nThis child remained with the Queen until the time when Madame was old\r\nenough to come home to her august mother, who had particularly taken upon\r\nherself the care of her education.\r\n\r\nThe Queen talked incessantly of the qualities which she admired in Louis\r\nXVI., and gladly attributed to herself the slightest favourable change in\r\nhis manner; perhaps she displayed too unreservedly the joy she felt, and\r\nthe share she appropriated in the improvement.  One day Louis XVI. saluted\r\nher ladies with more kindness than usual, and the Queen laughingly said to\r\nthem, “Now confess, ladies, that for one so badly taught as a child, the\r\nKing has saluted you with very good grace!”\r\n\r\nThe Queen hated M. de La Vauguyon; she accused him alone of those points\r\nin the habits, and even the sentiments, of the King which hurt her. A\r\nformer first woman of the bedchamber to Queen Maria Leczinska had\r\ncontinued in office near the young Queen.  She was one of those people who\r\nare fortunate enough to spend their lives in the service of kings without\r\nknowing anything of what is passing at Court.  She was a great devotee;\r\nthe Abbe Grisel, an ex-Jesuit, was her director.  Being rich from her\r\nsavings and an income of 50,000 livres, she kept a very good table; in her\r\napartment, at the Grand Commun, the most distinguished persons who still\r\nadhered to the Order of Jesuits often assembled.  The Duc de La Vauguyon\r\nwas intimate with her; their chairs at the Eglise des Reollets were placed\r\nnear each other; at high mass and at vespers they sang the “Gloria in\r\nExcelsis” and the “Magnificat” together; and the pious virgin, seeing in\r\nhim only one of God’s elect, little imagined him to be the declared enemy\r\nof a Princess whom she served and revered. On the day of his death she ran\r\nin tears to relate to the Queen the piety, humility, and repentance of the\r\nlast moments of the Duc de La Vauguyon.  He had called his people\r\ntogether, she said, to ask their pardon.  “For what?”  replied the Queen,\r\nsharply; “he has placed and pensioned off all his servants; it was of the\r\nKing and his brothers that the holy man you bewail should have asked\r\npardon, for having paid so little attention to the education of princes on\r\nwhom the fate and happiness of twenty-five millions of men depend.\r\nLuckily,” added she, “the King and his brothers, still young, have\r\nincessantly laboured to repair the errors of their preceptor.”\r\n\r\nThe progress of time, and the confidence with which the King and the\r\nPrinces, his brothers, were inspired by the change in their situation\r\nsince the death of Louis XV., had developed their characters.  I will\r\nendeavour to depict them.\r\n\r\nThe features of Louis XVI.  were noble enough, though somewhat melancholy\r\nin expression; his walk was heavy and unmajestic; his person greatly\r\nneglected; his hair, whatever might be the skill of his hairdresser, was\r\nsoon in disorder.  His voice, without being harsh, was not agreeable; if\r\nhe grew animated in speaking he often got above his natural pitch, and\r\nbecame shrill.  The Abbe de Radonvilliers, his preceptor, one of the Forty\r\nof the French Academy, a learned and amiable man, had given him and\r\nMonsieur a taste for study.  The King had continued to instruct himself;\r\nhe knew the English language perfectly; I have often heard him translate\r\nsome of the most difficult passages in Milton’s poems.  He was a skilful\r\ngeographer, and was fond of drawing and colouring maps; he was well versed\r\nin history, but had not perhaps sufficiently studied the spirit of it.  He\r\nappreciated dramatic beauties, and judged them accurately.  At Choisy, one\r\nday, several ladies expressed their dissatisfaction because the French\r\nactors were going to perform one of Moliere’s pieces.  The King inquired\r\nwhy they disapproved of the choice.  One of them answered that everybody\r\nmust admit that Moliere had very bad taste; the King replied that many\r\nthings might be found in Moliere contrary to fashion, but that it appeared\r\nto him difficult to point out any in bad taste?\r\n\r\n[The King, having purchased the Chateau of Rambouillet from the Duc de\r\nPenthievre, amused himself with embellishing it.  I have seen a register\r\nentirely in his own handwriting, which proves that he possessed a great\r\nvariety of information on the minutiae of various branches of knowledge.\r\nIn his accounts he would not omit an outlay of a franc.  His figures and\r\nletters, when he wished to write legibly, were small and very neat, but in\r\ngeneral he wrote very ill. He was so sparing of paper that he divided a\r\nsheet into eight, six, or four pieces, according to the length of what he\r\nhad to write. Towards the close of the page he compressed the letters, and\r\navoided interlineations.  The last words were close to the edge of the\r\npaper; he seemed to regret being obliged to begin another page.  He was\r\nmethodical and analytical; he divided what he wrote into chapters and\r\nsections.  He had extracted from the works of Nicole and Fenelon, his\r\nfavourite authors, three or four hundred concise and sententious phrases;\r\nthese he had classed according to subject, and formed a work of them in\r\nthe style of Montesquieu.  To this treatise he had given the following\r\ngeneral title: “Of Moderate Monarchy” (De la Monarchie temperee), with\r\nchapters entitled, “Of the Person of the Prince;”  “Of the Authority of\r\nBodies in the State;”  “Of the Character of the Executive Functions of the\r\nMonarchy.”  Had he been able to carry into effect all the grand precepts\r\nhe had observed in Fenelon, Louis XVI. would have been an accomplished\r\nmonarch, and France a powerful kingdom.  The King used to accept the\r\nspeeches his ministers presented to him to deliver on important occasions;\r\nbut he corrected and modified them; struck out some parts, and added\r\nothers; and sometimes consulted the Queen on the subject.  The phrase of\r\nthe minister erased by the King was frequently unsuitable, and dictated by\r\nthe minister’s private feelings; but the King’s was always the natural\r\nexpression.  He himself composed, three times or oftener, his famous\r\nanswers to the Parliament which he banished.  But in his letters he was\r\nnegligent, and always incorrect.  Simplicity was the characteristic of the\r\nKing’s style; the figurative style of M. Necker did not please him; the\r\nsarcasms of Maurepas were disagreeable to him.  Unfortunate Prince! he\r\nwould predict, in his observations, that if such a calamity should happen,\r\nthe monarchy would be ruined; and the next day he would consent in Council\r\nto the very measure which he had condemned the day before, and which\r\nbrought him nearer the brink of the precipice.--SOULAVIE, “Historical and\r\nPolitical Memoirs of the Reign of Louis XVI.,” vol.  ii.]\r\n\r\nThis Prince combined with his attainments the attributes of a good\r\nhusband, a tender father, and an indulgent master.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately he showed too much predilection for the mechanical arts;\r\nmasonry and lock-making so delighted him that he admitted into his private\r\napartment a common locksmith, with whom he made keys and locks; and his\r\nhands, blackened by that sort of work, were often, in my presence, the\r\nsubject of remonstrances and even sharp reproaches from the Queen, who\r\nwould have chosen other amusements for her husband.\r\n\r\n[Louis XVI. saw that the art of lock-making was capable of application to\r\na higher study, He was an excellent geographer.  The most valuable and\r\ncomplete instrument for the study of that science was begun by his orders\r\nand under his direction.  It was an immense globe of copper, which was\r\nlong preserved, though unfinished, in the Mazarine library.  Louis XVI.\r\ninvented and had executed under his own eyes the ingenious mechanism\r\nrequired for this globe.--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nAustere and rigid with regard to himself alone, the King observed the laws\r\nof the Church with scrupulous exactness.  He fasted and abstained\r\nthroughout the whole of Lent.  He thought it right that the queen should\r\nnot observe these customs with the same strictness.  Though sincerely\r\npious, the spirit of the age had disposed his mind to toleration. Turgot,\r\nMalesherbes, and Necker judged that this Prince, modest and simple in his\r\nhabits, would willingly sacrifice the royal prerogative to the solid\r\ngreatness of his people.  His heart, in truth, disposed him towards\r\nreforms; but his prejudices and fears, and the clamours of pious and\r\nprivileged persons, intimidated him, and made him abandon plans which his\r\nlove for the people had suggested.\r\n\r\nMonsieur had more dignity of demeanour than the King; but his corpulence\r\nrendered his gait inelegant.  He was fond of pageantry and magnificence.\r\nHe cultivated the belles lettres, and under assumed names often\r\ncontributed verses to the Mercury and other papers.\r\n\r\n[During his stay at Avignon, Monsieur, afterwards Louis XVIII, lodged with\r\nthe Duc de Crillon; he refused the town-guard which was offered him,\r\nsaying, “A son of France, under the roof of a Crillon, needs no\r\nguard.”--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nHis wonderful memory was the handmaid of his wit, furnishing him with the\r\nhappiest quotations.  He knew by heart a varied repertoire, from the\r\nfinest passages of the Latin classics to the Latin of all the prayers,\r\nfrom the works of Racine to the vaudeville of “Rose et Colas.”\r\n\r\nThe Comte d’Artoisi had an agreeable countenance, was well made, skilful\r\nin bodily exercises, lively, impetuous, fond of pleasure, and very\r\nparticular in his dress.  Some happy observations made by him were\r\nrepeated with approval, and gave a favourable idea of his heart.  The\r\nParisians liked the open and frank character of this Prince, which they\r\nconsidered national, and showed real affection for him.\r\n\r\nThe dominion that the Queen gained over the King’s mind, the charms of a\r\nsociety in which Monsieur displayed his wit, and to which the Comte\r\nd’Artois--[Afterwards Charles X.]--gave life by the vivacity of youth,\r\ngradually softened that ruggedness of manner in Louis XVI. which a\r\nbetter-conducted education might have prevented.  Still, this defect often\r\nshowed itself, and, in spite of his extreme simplicity, the King inspired\r\nthose who had occasion to speak to him with diffidence. Courtiers,\r\nsubmissive in the presence of their sovereign, are only the more ready to\r\ncaricature him; with little good breeding, they called those answers they\r\nso much dreaded, Les coups de boutoir du Roi.--[The literal meaning of the\r\nphrase “coup de boutoir,” is a thrust from the snout of a boar.]\r\n\r\nMethodical in all his habits, the King always went to bed at eleven\r\nprecisely.  One evening the Queen was going with her usual circle to a\r\nparty, either at the Duc de Duras’s or the Princesse de Glumenee’s. The\r\nhand of the clock was slily put forward to hasten the King’s departure by\r\na few minutes; he thought bed-time was come, retired, and found none of\r\nhis attendants ready to wait on him.  This joke became known in all the\r\ndrawing-rooms of Versailles, and was disapproved of there.  Kings have no\r\nprivacy.  Queens have no boudoirs.  If those who are in immediate\r\nattendance upon sovereigns be not themselves disposed to transmit their\r\nprivate habits to posterity, the meanest valet will relate what he has\r\nseen or heard; his gossip circulates rapidly, and forms public opinion,\r\nwhich at length ascribes to the most august persons characters which,\r\nhowever untrue they may be, are almost always indelible.\r\n\r\nNOTE.  The only passion ever shown by Louis XVI. was for hunting.  He was\r\nso much occupied by it that when I went up into his private closets at\r\nVersailles, after the 10th of August, I saw upon the staircase six frames,\r\nin which were seen statements of all his hunts, when Dauphin and when\r\nKing.  In them was detailed the number, kind, and quality of the game he\r\nhad killed at each hunting party during every month, every season, and\r\nevery year of his reign.\r\n\r\nThe interior of his private apartments was thus arranged: a salon,\r\nornamented with gilded mouldings, displayed the engravings which had been\r\ndedicated to him, drawings of the canals he had dug, with the model of\r\nthat of Burgundy, and the plan of the cones and works of Cherbourg.  The\r\nupper hall contained his collection of geographical charts, spheres,\r\nglobes, and also his geographical cabinet.  There were to be seen drawings\r\nof maps which he had begun, and some that he had finished.  He had a\r\nclever method of washing them in.  His geographical memory was prodigious.\r\nOver the hall was the turning and joining room, furnished with ingenious\r\ninstruments for working in wood.  He inherited some from Louis XV., and he\r\noften busied himself, with Duret’s assistance, in keeping them clean and\r\nbright.  Above was the library of books published during his reign.  The\r\nprayer books and manuscript books of Anne of Brittany, Francois I, the\r\nlater Valois, Louis XIV., Louis XV., and the Dauphin formed the great\r\nhereditary library of the Chateau.  Louis XVI. placed separately, in two\r\napartments communicating with each other, the works of his own time,\r\nincluding a complete collection of Didot’s editions, in vellum, every\r\nvolume enclosed in a morocco case.  There were several English works,\r\namong the rest the debates of the British Parliament, in a great number of\r\nvolumes in folio (this is the Moniteur of England, a complete collection\r\nof which is so valuable and so scarce). By the side of this collection was\r\nto be seen a manuscript history of all the schemes for a descent upon that\r\nisland, particularly that of Comte de Broglie.  One of the presses of this\r\ncabinet was full of cardboard boxes, containing papers relative to the\r\nHouse of Austria, inscribed in the King’s own hand: “Secret papers of my\r\nfamily respecting the House of Austria; papers of my family respecting the\r\nHouses of Stuart and Hanover.”  In an adjoining press were kept papers\r\nrelative to Russia. Satirical works against Catherine II.  and against\r\nPaul I.  were sold in France under the name of histories; Louis XVIII.\r\ncollected and sealed up with his small seal the scandalous anecdotes\r\nagainst Catherine II., as well as the works of Rhulieres, of which he had\r\na copy, to be certain that the secret life of that Princess, which\r\nattracted the curiosity of her contemporaries, should not be made public\r\nby his means.\r\n\r\nAbove the King’s private library were a forge, two anvils, and a vast\r\nnumber of iron tools; various common locks, well made and perfect; some\r\nsecret locks, and locks ornamented with gilt copper.  It was there that\r\nthe infamous Gamin, who afterwards accused the King of having tried to\r\npoison him, and was rewarded for his calumny with a pension of twelve\r\nthousand livres, taught him the art of lock-making.  This Gamin, who\r\nbecame our guide, by order of the department and municipality of\r\nVersailles, did not, however, denounce the King on the 20th December,\r\n1792.  He had been made the confidant of that Prince in an immense number\r\nof important commissions; the King had sent him the “Red Book,” from\r\nParis, in a parcel; and the part which was concealed during the\r\nConstituent Assembly still remained so in 1793.  Gamin hid it in a part of\r\nthe Chateau inaccessible to everybody, and took it from under the shelves\r\nof a secret press before our eyes.  This is a convincing proof that Louis\r\nXVI. hoped to return to his Chiteau.  When teaching Louis XVI. his trade\r\nGamin took upon himself the tone and authority of a master. “The King was\r\ngood, forbearing, timid, inquisitive, and addicted to sleep,” said Gamin\r\nto me; “he was fond to excess of lock-making, and he concealed himself\r\nfrom the Queen and the Court to file and forge with me. In order to convey\r\nhis anvil and my own backwards and forwards we were obliged to use a\r\nthousand stratagems, the history of which would: never end.”  Above the\r\nKing’s and Gamin’s forges and anvils was an, observatory, erected upon a\r\nplatform covered with lead.  There, seated on an armchair, and assisted by\r\na telescope, the King observed all that was passing in the courtyards of\r\nVersailles, the avenue of Paris, and the neighbouring gardens.  He had\r\ntaken a liking to Duret, one of the indoor servants of the palace, who\r\nsharpened his tools, cleaned his anvils, pasted his maps, and adjusted\r\neyeglasses to the King’s sight, who was short-sighted.  This good Duret,\r\nand indeed all the indoor servants, spoke of their master with regret and\r\naffection, and with tears in their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe King was born weak and delicate; but from the age of twenty-four he\r\npossessed a robust constitution, inherited from his mother, who was of the\r\nHouse of Saxe, celebrated for generations for its robustness.  There were\r\ntwo men in Louis XVI., the man of knowledge and the man of will. The King\r\nknew the history of his own family and of the first houses of France\r\nperfectly.  He composed the instructions for M. de la Peyrouse’s voyage\r\nround the world, which the minister thought were drawn up by several\r\nmembers of the Academy of Sciences.  His memory retained an infinite\r\nnumber of names and situations.  He remembered quantities and numbers\r\nwonderfully.  One day an account was presented to him in which the\r\nminister had ranked among the expenses an item inserted in the account of\r\nthe preceding year.  “There is a double charge,” said the King; “bring me\r\nlast year’s account, and I will show it yet there.”  When the King was\r\nperfectly master of the details of any matter, and saw injustice, he was\r\nobdurate even to harshness.  Then he would be obeyed instantly, in order\r\nto be sure that he was obeyed.\r\n\r\nBut in important affairs of state the man of will was not to be found.\r\nLouis XVI. was upon the throne exactly what those weak temperaments whom\r\nnature has rendered incapable of an opinion are in society.  In his\r\npusillanimity, he gave his confidence to a minister; and although amidst\r\nvarious counsels he often knew which was the best, he never had the\r\nresolution to say, “I prefer the opinion of such a one.”  Herein\r\noriginated the misfortunes of the State.--SOULAVIE’S “Historical and\r\nPolitical Memoirs Of the Reign Of LOUIS XVI.,” VOL ii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter following the confinement of the Comtesse d’Artois was very\r\nsevere; the recollections of the pleasure which sleighing-parties had\r\ngiven the Queen in her childhood made her wish to introduce similar ones\r\nin France.  This amusement had already been known in that Court, as was\r\nproved by sleighs being found in the stables which had been used by the\r\nDauphin, the father of Louis XVI.  Some were constructed for the Queen in\r\na more modern style.  The Princes also ordered several; and in a few days\r\nthere was a tolerable number of these vehicles.  They were driven by the\r\nprinces and noblemen of the Court.  The noise of the bells and balls with\r\nwhich the harness of the horses was furnished, the elegance and whiteness\r\nof their plumes, the varied forms of the carriages, the gold with which\r\nthey were all ornamented, rendered these parties delightful to the eye.\r\nThe winter was very favourable to them, the snow remaining on the ground\r\nnearly six weeks; the drives in the park afforded a pleasure shared by the\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\n[Louis XVI., touched with the wretched condition of the poor of Versailles\r\nduring the winter of 1776, had several cart-loads of wood distributed\r\namong them.  Seeing one day a file of those vehicles passing by, while\r\nseveral noblemen were preparing to be drawn swiftly over the ice, he\r\nuttered these memorable words: “Gentlemen, here are my sleighs!”--NOTE BY\r\nTHE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nNo one imagined that any blame could attach to so innocent an amusement.\r\nBut the party were tempted to extend their drives as far as the Champs\r\nElysees; a few sleighs even crossed the boulevards; the ladies being\r\nmasked, the Queen’s enemies took the opportunity of saying that she had\r\ntraversed the streets of Paris in a sleigh.\r\n\r\nThis became a matter of moment.  The public discovered in it a\r\npredilection for the habits of Vienna; but all that Marie Antoinette did\r\nwas criticised.\r\n\r\nSleigh-driving, savouring of the Northern Courts, had no favour among the\r\nParisians.  The Queen was informed of this; and although all the sleighs\r\nwere preserved, and several subsequent winters lent themselves to the\r\namusement, she would not resume it.\r\n\r\nIt was at the time of the sleighing-parties that the Queen became\r\nintimately acquainted with the Princesse de Lamballe, who made her\r\nappearance in them wrapped in fur, with all the brilliancy and freshness\r\nof the age of twenty,--the emblem of spring, peeping from under sable and\r\nermine.  Her situation, moreover, rendered her peculiarly interesting;\r\nmarried, when she was scarcely past childhood, to a young prince, who\r\nruined himself by the contagious example of the Duc d’Orleans, she had had\r\nnothing to do from the time of her arrival in France but to weep. A widow\r\nat eighteen, and childless, she lived with the Duc de Penthievre as an\r\nadopted daughter.  She had the tenderest respect and attachment for that\r\nvenerable Prince; but the Queen, though doing justice to his virtues, saw\r\nthat the Duc de Penthievre’s way of life, whether at Paris or at his\r\ncountry-seat, could neither afford his young daughter-in-law the\r\namusements suited to her time of life, nor ensure her in the future an\r\nestablishment such as she was deprived of by her widowhood.  She\r\ndetermined, therefore, to establish her at Versailles; and for her sake\r\nrevived the office of superintendent, which had been discontinued at Court\r\nsince the death of Mademoiselle de Clermont.  It is said that Maria\r\nLeczinska had decided that this place should continue vacant, the\r\nsuperintendent having so extensive a power in the houses of queens as to\r\nbe frequently a restraint upon their inclinations.  Differences which soon\r\ntook place between Marie Antoinette and the Princesse de Lamballe\r\nrespecting the official prerogatives of the latter, proved that the wife\r\nof Louis XV. had acted judiciously in abolishing the office; but a kind of\r\ntreaty made between the Queen and the Princess smoothed all difficulties.\r\nThe blame for too strong an assertion of claims fell upon a secretary of\r\nthe superintendent, who had been her adviser; and everything was so\r\narranged that a firm friendship existed between these two Princesses down\r\nto the disastrous period which terminated their career.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the enthusiasm which the splendour, grace, and kindness of\r\nthe Queen generally inspired, secret intrigues continued in operation\r\nagainst her.  A short time after the ascension of Louis XVI. to the\r\nthrone, the minister of the King’s household was informed that a most\r\noffensive libel against the Queen was about to appear.  The lieutenant of\r\npolice deputed a man named Goupil, a police inspector, to trace this\r\nlibel; he came soon after to say that he had found out the place where the\r\nwork was being printed, and that it was at a country house near Yverdun.\r\nHe had already got possession of two sheets, which contained the most\r\natrocious calumnies, conveyed with a degree of art which might make them\r\nvery dangerous to the Queen’s reputation.  Goupil said that he could\r\nobtain the rest, but that he should want a considerable sum for that\r\npurpose.  Three thousand Louis were given him, and very soon afterwards he\r\nbrought the whole manuscript and all that had been printed to the\r\nlieutenant of police.  He received a thousand louis more as a reward for\r\nhis address and zeal; and a much more important office was about to be\r\ngiven him, when another spy, envious of Goupil’s good fortune, gave\r\ninformation that Goupil himself was the author of the libel; that, ten\r\nyears before, he had been put into the Bicetre for swindling; and that\r\nMadame Goupil had been only three years out of the Salpetriere, where she\r\nhad been placed under another name.  This Madame Goupil was very pretty\r\nand very intriguing; she had found means to form an intimacy with Cardinal\r\nde Rohan, whom she led, it is said, to hope for a reconciliation with the\r\nQueen.  All this affair was hushed up; but it shows that it was the\r\nQueen’s fate to be incessantly attacked by the meanest and most odious\r\nmachinations.\r\n\r\nAnother woman, named Cahouette de Millers, whose husband held an office in\r\nthe Treasury, being very irregular in conduct, and of a scheming turn of\r\nmind, had a mania for appearing in the eyes of her friends at Paris as a\r\nperson in favour at Court, to which she was not entitled by either birth\r\nor office.  During the latter years of the life of Louis XV. she had made\r\nmany dupes, and picked up considerable sums by passing herself off as the\r\nKing’s mistress.  The fear of irritating Madame du Barry was, according to\r\nher, the only thing which prevented her enjoying that title openly.  She\r\ncame regularly to Versailles, kept herself concealed in a furnished\r\nlodging, and her dupes imagined she was secretly summoned to Court.\r\n\r\nThis woman formed the scheme of getting admission, if possible, to the\r\npresence of the Queen, or at least causing it to be believed that she had\r\ndone so.  She adopted as her lover Gabriel de Saint Charles, intendant of\r\nher Majesty’s finances,--an office, the privileges of which were confined\r\nto the right of entering the Queen’s apartment on Sunday.  Madame de\r\nVillers came every Saturday to Versailles with M. de Saint Charles, and\r\nlodged in his apartment.  M. Campan was there several times.  She painted\r\ntolerably well, and she requested him to do her the favour to present to\r\nthe Queen a portrait of her Majesty which she had just copied.  M. Campan\r\nknew the woman’s character, and refused her.  A few days after, he saw on\r\nher Majesty’s couch the portrait which he had declined to present to her;\r\nthe Queen thought it badly painted, and gave orders that it should be\r\ncarried back to the Princesse de Lamballe, who had sent it to her.  The\r\nill success of the portrait did not deter the manoeuvrer from following up\r\nher designs; she easily procured through M. de Saint Charles patents and\r\norders signed by the Queen; she then set about imitating her writing, and\r\ncomposed a great number of notes and letters, as if written by her\r\nMajesty, in the tenderest and most familiar style.  For many months she\r\nshowed them as great secrets to several of her particular friends.\r\nAfterwards, she made the Queen appear to write to her, to procure various\r\nfancy articles.  Under the pretext of wishing to execute her Majesty’s\r\ncommissions accurately, she gave these letters to the tradesmen to read,\r\nand succeeded in having it said, in many houses, that the Queen had a\r\nparticular regard for her.  She then enlarged her scheme, and represented\r\nthe Queen as desiring to borrow 200,000 francs which she had need of, but\r\nwhich she did not wish to ask of the King from his private funds.  This\r\nletter, being shown to M. Beranger, ‘fermier general’ of the finances,\r\ntook effect; he thought himself fortunate in being able to render this\r\nassistance to his sovereign, and lost no time in sending the 200,000\r\nfrancs to Madame de Villers.  This first step was followed by some doubts,\r\nwhich he communicated to people better informed than himself of what was\r\npassing at Court; they added to his uneasiness; he then went to M. de\r\nSartine, who unravelled the whole plot.  The woman was sent to St.\r\nPelagie; and the unfortunate husband was ruined, by replacing the sum\r\nborrowed, and by paying for the jewels fraudulently purchased in the\r\nQueen’s name.  The forged letters were sent to her Majesty; I compared\r\nthem in her presence with her own handwriting, and the only\r\ndistinguishable difference was a little more regularity in the letters.\r\n\r\nThis trick, discovered and punished with prudence and without passion,\r\nproduced no more sensation out of doors than that of the Inspector Goupil.\r\n\r\nA year after the nomination of Madame de Lamballe to the post of\r\nsuperintendent of the Queen’s household, balls and quadrilles gave rise to\r\nthe intimacy of her Majesty with the Comtesse Jules de Polignac.  This\r\nlady really interested Marie Antoinette.  She was not rich, and generally\r\nlived upon her estate at Claye.  The Queen was astonished at not having\r\nseen her at Court earlier.  The confession that her want of fortune had\r\neven prevented her appearance at the celebration of the marriages of the\r\nPrinces added to the interest which she had inspired.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was full of consideration, and took delight in counteracting the\r\ninjustice of fortune.  The Countess was induced to come to Court by her\r\nhusband’s sister, Madame Diane de Polignac, who had been appointed lady of\r\nhonour to the Comtesse d’Artois.  The Comtesse Jules was really fond of a\r\ntranquil life; the impression she made at Court affected her but little;\r\nshe felt only the attachment manifested for her by the Queen. I had\r\noccasion to see her from the commencement of her favour at Court; she\r\noften passed whole hours with me, while waiting for the Queen.  She\r\nconversed with me freely and ingenuously about the honour, and at the same\r\ntime the danger, she saw in the kindness of which she was the object.  The\r\nQueen sought for the sweets of friendship; but can this gratification, so\r\nrare in any rank, exist between a Queen and a subject, when they are\r\nsurrounded, moreover, by snares laid by the artifice of courtiers?  This\r\npardonable error was fatal to the happiness of Marie Antoinette.\r\n\r\nThe retiring character of the Comtesse Jules, afterwards Duchesse de\r\nPolignac, cannot be spoken of too favourably; but if her heart was\r\nincapable of forming ambitious projects, her family and friends in her\r\nfortune beheld their own, and endeavoured to secure the favour of the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\n[The Comtesse, afterwards Duchesse de Polignac, nee Polastron, Married the\r\nComte (in 1780 the Duc) Jules de Polignac, the father of the Prince de\r\nPolignac of Napoleon’s and of Charles X.’s time.  She emigrated in 1789,\r\nand died in Vienna in 1793.]\r\n\r\nThe Comtesse de Diane, sister of M. de Polignac, and the Baron de Besenval\r\nand M. de Vaudreuil, particular friends of the Polignac family, made use\r\nof means, the success of which was infallible.  One of my friends (Comte\r\nde Moustier), who was in their secret, came to tell me that Madame de\r\nPolignac was about to quit Versailles suddenly; that she would take leave\r\nof the Queen only in writing; that the Comtesse Diane and M. de Vaudreuil\r\nhad dictated her letter, and the whole affair was arranged for the purpose\r\nof stimulating the attachment of Marie Antoinette.  The next day, when I\r\nwent up to the palace, I found the Queen with a letter in her hand, which\r\nshe was reading with much emotion; it was the letter from the Comtesse\r\nJules; the Queen showed it to me. The Countess expressed in it her grief\r\nat leaving a princess who had loaded her with kindness.  The narrowness of\r\nher fortune compelled her to do so; but she was much more strongly\r\nimpelled by the fear that the Queen’s friendship, after having raised up\r\ndangerous enemies against her, might abandon her to their hatred, and to\r\nthe regret of having lost the august favour of which she was the object.\r\n\r\nThis step produced the full effect that had been expected from it.  A\r\nyoung and sensitive queen cannot long bear the idea of contradiction. She\r\nbusied herself in settling the Comtesse Jules near her, by making such a\r\nprovision for her as should place her beyond anxiety.  Her character\r\nsuited the Queen; she had merely natural talents, no pedantry, no\r\naffectation of knowledge.  She was of middle size; her complexion very\r\nfair, her eyebrows and hair dark brown, her teeth superb, her smile\r\nenchanting, and her whole person graceful.  She was seen almost always in\r\na demi-toilet, remarkable only for neatness and good taste.  I do not\r\nthink I ever once saw diamonds about her, even at the climax of her\r\nfortune, when she had the rank of Duchess at Court.\r\n\r\nI have always believed that her sincere attachment for the Queen, as much\r\nas her love of simplicity, induced her to avoid everything that might\r\ncause her to be thought a wealthy favourite.  She had not one of the\r\nfailings which usually accompany that position.  She loved the persons who\r\nshared the Queen’s affections, and was entirely free from jealousy. Marie\r\nAntoinette flattered herself that the Comtesse Jules and the Princesse de\r\nLamballe would be her especial friends, and that she should possess a\r\nsociety formed according to her own taste.  “I will receive them in my\r\ncloset, or at Trianon,” said she; “I will enjoy the comforts of private\r\nlife, which exist not for us, unless we have the good sense to secure them\r\nfor ourselves.”  The happiness the Queen thought to secure was destined to\r\nturn to vexation.  All those courtiers who were not admitted to this\r\nintimacy became so many jealous and vindictive enemies.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to make a suitable provision for the Countess.  The place\r\nof first equerry, in reversion after the Comte de Tesse, given to Comte\r\nJules unknown to the titular holder, displeased the family of Noailles.\r\nThis family had just sustained another mortification, the appointment of\r\nthe Princesse de Lamballe having in some degree rendered necessary the\r\nresignation of the Comtesse de Noailles, whose husband was thereupon made\r\na marshal of France.  The Princesse de Lamballe, although she did not\r\nquarrel with the Queen, was alarmed at the establishment of the Comtesse\r\nJules at Court, and did not form, as her Majesty had hoped, a part of that\r\nintimate society, which was in turn composed of Mesdames Jules and Diane\r\nde Polignac, d’Andlau and de Chalon, and Messieurs de Guignes, de Coigny,\r\nd’Adhemar, de Besenval, lieutenant-colonel of the Swiss, de Polignac, de\r\nVaudreuil, and de Guiche; the Prince de Ligne and the Duke of Dorset, the\r\nEnglish ambassador, were also admitted.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before the Comtesse Jules maintained any great state at\r\nCourt.  The Queen contented herself with giving her very fine apartments\r\nat the top of the marble staircase.  The salary of first equerry, the\r\ntrifling emoluments derived from M. de Polignac’s regiment, added to their\r\nslender patrimony, and perhaps some small pension, at that time formed the\r\nwhole fortune of the favourite.  I never saw the Queen make her a present\r\nof value; I was even astonished one day at hearing her Majesty mention,\r\nwith pleasure, that the Countess had gained ten thousand francs in the\r\nlottery.  “She was in great want of it,” added the Queen.\r\n\r\nThus the Polignacs were not settled at Court in any degree of splendour\r\nwhich could justify complaints from others, and the substantial favours\r\nbestowed upon that family were less envied than the intimacy between them\r\nand their proteges and the Queen.  Those who had no hope of entering the\r\ncircle of the Comtesse Jules were made jealous by the opportunities of\r\nadvancement it afforded.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the time I speak of, the society around the Comtesse Jules was\r\nfully engaged in gratifying the young Queen.  Of this the Marquis de\r\nVaudreuil was a conspicuous member; he was a brilliant man, the friend and\r\nprotector of men of letters and celebrated artists.\r\n\r\nThe Baron de Besenval added to the bluntness of the Swiss all the\r\nadroitness of a French courtier.  His fifty years and gray hairs made him\r\nenjoy among women the confidence inspired by mature age, although he had\r\nnot given up the thought of love affairs.  He talked of his native\r\nmountains with enthusiasm.  He would at any time sing the “Ranz des\r\nVaches” with tears in his eyes, and was the best story-teller in the\r\nComtesse Jules’s circle.  The last new song or ‘bon mot’ and the gossip of\r\nthe day were the sole topics of conversation in the Queen’s parties. Wit\r\nwas banished from them.  The Comtesse Diane, more inclined to literary\r\npursuits than her sister-in-law, one day, recommended her to read the\r\n“Iliad” and “Odyssey.”  The latter replied, laughing, that she was\r\nperfectly acquainted with the Greek poet, and said to prove it:\r\n\r\n“Homere etait aveugle et jouait du hautbois.”\r\n\r\n(Homer was blind and played on the hautboy.)\r\n\r\n[This lively repartee of the Duchesse de Polignac is a droll imitation of\r\na line in the “Mercure Galant.”  In the quarrel scene one of the lawyers\r\nsays to his brother quill: ‘Ton pere etait aveugle et jouait du\r\nhautbois.’]\r\n\r\nThe Queen found this sort of humour very much to her taste, and said that\r\nno pedant should ever be her friend.\r\n\r\nBefore the Queen fixed her assemblies at Madame de Polignac’s, she\r\noccasionally passed the evening at the house of the Duc and Duchesse de\r\nDuras, where a brilliant party of young persons met together.  They\r\nintroduced a taste for trifling games, such as question and answer,\r\n‘guerre panpan’, blind man’s buff, and especially a game called\r\n‘descampativos’.  The people of Paris, always criticising, but always\r\nimitating the customs of the Court, were infected with the mania for these\r\nchildish sports.  Madame de Genlis, sketching the follies of the day in\r\none of her plays, speaks of these famous ‘descampativos’; and also of the\r\nrage for making a friend, called the ‘inseparable’, until a whim or the\r\nslightest difference might occasion a total rupture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Choiseul had reappeared at Court on the ceremony of the King’s\r\ncoronation for the first time after his disgrace under Louis XV. in 1770.\r\nThe state of public feeling on the subject gave his friends hope of seeing\r\nhim again in administration, or in the Council of State; but the opposite\r\nparty was too firmly seated at Versailles, and the young Queen’s influence\r\nwas outweighed, in the mind of the King, by long-standing prejudices; she\r\ntherefore gave up for ever her attempt to reinstate the Duke.  Thus this\r\nPrincess, who has been described as so ambitious, and so strenuously\r\nsupporting the interest of the House of Austria, failed twice in the only\r\nscheme which could forward the views constantly attributed to her; and\r\nspent the whole of her reign surrounded by enemies of herself and her\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette took little pains to promote literature and the fine\r\narts.  She had been annoyed in consequence of having ordered a performance\r\nof the “Connstable de Bourbon,” on the celebration of the marriage of\r\nMadame Clotilde with the Prince of Piedmont.  The Court and the people of\r\nParis censured as indecorous the naming characters in the piece after the\r\nreigning family, and that with which the new alliance was formed.  The\r\nreading of this piece by the Comte de Guibert in the Queen’s closet had\r\nproduced in her Majesty’s circle that sort of enthusiasm which obscures\r\nthe judgment.  She promised herself she would have no more readings.  Yet,\r\nat the request of M. de Cubieres, the King’s equerry, the Queen agreed to\r\nhear the reading of a comedy written by his brother. She collected her\r\nintimate circle, Messieurs de Coigny, de Vaudreuil, de Besenval, Mesdames\r\nde Polignac, de Chalon, etc., and to increase the number of judges, she\r\nadmitted the two Parnys, the Chevalier de Bertin, my father-in-law, and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nMold read for the author.  I never could satisfy myself by what magic the\r\nskilful reader gained our unanimous approbation of a ridiculous work.\r\nSurely the delightful voice of Mold, by awakening our recollection of the\r\ndramatic beauties of the French stage, prevented the wretched lines of\r\nDorat Cubieres from striking on our ears.  I can assert that the\r\nexclamation Charming! charming! repeatedly interrupted the reader.  The\r\npiece was admitted for performance at Fontainebleau; and for the first\r\ntime the King had the curtain dropped before the end of the play.  It was\r\ncalled the “Dramomane” or “Dramaturge.”  All the characters died of eating\r\npoison in a pie.  The Queen, highly disconcerted at having recommended\r\nthis absurd production, announced that she would never hear another\r\nreading; and this time she kept her word.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of “Mustapha and Mangir,” by M. de Chamfort, was highly\r\nsuccessful at the Court theatre at Fontainebleau.  The Queen procured the\r\nauthor a pension of 1,200 francs, but his play failed on being performed\r\nat Paris.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of opposition which prevailed in that city delighted in\r\nreversing the verdicts of the Court.  The Queen determined never again to\r\ngive any marked countenance to new dramatic works.  She reserved her\r\npatronage for musical composers, and in a few years their art arrived at a\r\nperfection it had never before attained in France.\r\n\r\nIt was solely to gratify the Queen that the manager of the Opera brought\r\nthe first company of comic actors to Paris.  Gluck, Piccini, and Sacchini\r\nwere attracted there in succession.  These eminent composers were treated\r\nwith great distinction at Court.  Immediately on his arrival in France,\r\nGluck was admitted to the Queen’s toilet, and she talked to him all the\r\ntime he remained with her.  She asked him one day whether he had nearly\r\nbrought his grand opera of “Armide” to a conclusion, and whether it\r\npleased him.  Gluck replied very coolly, in his German accent, “Madame, it\r\nwill soon be finished, and really it will be superb.”  There was a great\r\noutcry against the confidence with which the composer had spoken of one of\r\nhis own productions.  The Queen defended him warmly; she insisted that he\r\ncould not be ignorant of the merit of his works; that he well knew they\r\nwere generally admired, and that no doubt he was afraid lest a modesty,\r\nmerely dictated by politeness, should look like affectation in him.\r\n\r\n[Gluck often had to deal with self-sufficiency equal to his own. He was\r\nvery reluctant to introduce long ballets into “Iphigenia.” Vestris deeply\r\nregretted that the opera was not terminated by a piece they called a\r\nchaconne, in which he displayed all his power. He complained to Gluck\r\nabout it.  Gluck, who treated his art with all the dignity it merits,\r\nreplied that in so interesting a subject dancing would be misplaced.\r\nBeing pressed another time by Vestris on the same subject, “A chaconne!  A\r\nchaconne!”  roared out the enraged musician; “we must describe the Greeks;\r\nand had the Greeks chaconnes?”  “They had not?”  returned the astonished\r\ndancer; “why, then, so much the worse for them!”--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThe Queen did not confine her admiration to the lofty style of the French\r\nand Italian operas; she greatly valued Gretry’s music, so well adapted to\r\nthe spirit and feeling of the words.  A great deal of the poetry set to\r\nmusic by Gretry is by Marmontel.  The day after the first performance of\r\n“Zemira and Azor,” Marmontel and Gretry were presented to the Queen as she\r\nwas passing through the gallery of Fontainebleau to go to mass.  The Queen\r\ncongratulated Gretry on the success of the new opera, and told him that\r\nshe had dreamed of the enchanting effect of the trio by Zemira’s father\r\nand sisters behind the magic mirror.  Gretry, in a transport of joy, took\r\nMarmontel in his arms, “Ah! my friend,” cried he, “excellent music may be\r\nmade of this.”--“And execrable words,” coolly observed Marmontel, to whom\r\nher Majesty had not addressed a single compliment.\r\n\r\nThe most indifferent artists were permitted to have the honour of painting\r\nthe Queen.  A full-length portrait, representing her in all the pomp of\r\nroyalty, was exhibited in the gallery of Versailles.  This picture, which\r\nwas intended for the Court of Vienna, was executed by a man who does not\r\ndeserve even to be named, and disgusted all people of taste.  It seemed as\r\nif this art had, in France, retrograded several centuries.\r\n\r\nThe Queen had not that enlightened judgment, or even that mere taste,\r\nwhich enables princes to foster and protect great talents.  She confessed\r\nfrankly that she saw no merit in any portrait beyond the likeness.  When\r\nshe went to the Louvre, she would run hastily over all the little “genre”\r\n pictures, and come out, as she acknowledged, without having once raised\r\nher eyes to the grand compositions.\r\n\r\nThere is no good portrait of the Queen, save that by Werthmuller, chief\r\npainter to the King of Sweden, which was sent to Stockholm, and that by\r\nMadame Lebrun, which was saved from the revolutionary fury by the\r\ncommissioners for the care of the furniture at Versailles.\r\n\r\n[A sketch of very great interest made when the Queen was in the Temple and\r\ndiscovered many years afterwards there, recently reproduced in the memoirs\r\nof the Marquise de Tourzel (Paris, Plon), is the last authentic portrait\r\nof the unhappy Queen.  See also the catalogue of portraits made by Lord\r\nRonald Gower.]\r\n\r\nThe composition of the latter picture resembles that of Henriette of\r\nFrance, the wife of the unfortunate Charles I., painted by Vandyke.  Like\r\nMarie Antoinette, she is seated, surrounded by her children, and that\r\nresemblance adds to the melancholy interest raised by this beautiful\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nWhile admitting that the Queen gave no direct encouragement to any art but\r\nthat of music, I should be wrong to pass over in silence the patronage\r\nconferred by her and the Princes, brothers of the King, on the art of\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\n[In 1790 the King gave a proof of his particular good-will to the\r\nbookselling trade.  A company consisting of the first Parisian\r\nbooksellers, being on the eve of stopping payment, succeeded in laying\r\nbefore the King a statement of their distressed situation. The monarch was\r\naffected by it; he took from the civil list the sum of which the society\r\nstood in immediate need, and became security for the repayment of the\r\nremainder of the 1,200,000 livres, which they wanted to borrow, and for\r\nthe repayment of which he fixed no particular time.]\r\n\r\nTo Marie Antoinette we are indebted for a splendid quarto edition of the\r\nworks of Metastasio; to Monsieur, the King’s brother, for a quarto Tasso,\r\nembellished with engravings after Cochin; and to the Comte d’Artois for a\r\nsmall collection of select works, which is considered one of the chef\r\nd’oeuvres of the press of the celebrated Didot.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, on the death of the Marechal du Muy, the ascendency obtained by\r\nthe sect of innovators occasioned M. de Saint-Germain to be recalled to\r\nCourt and made Minister of War.  His first care was the destruction of the\r\nKing’s military household establishment, an imposing and effectual rampart\r\nround the sovereign power.\r\n\r\nWhen Chancellor Maupeou obtained from Louis XV. the destruction of the\r\nParliament and the exile of all the ancient magistrates, the Mousquetaires\r\nwere charged with the execution of the commission for this purpose; and at\r\nthe stroke of midnight, the presidents and members were all arrested, each\r\nby two Mousquetaires.  In the spring of 1775 a popular insurrection had\r\ntaken place in consequence of the high price of bread. M. Turgot’s new\r\nregulation, which permitted unlimited trade in corn, was either its cause\r\nor the pretext for it; and the King’s household troops again rendered the\r\ngreatest services to public tranquillity.\r\n\r\nI have never be enable to discover the true cause of the support given to\r\nM. de Saint-Germain’s policy by the Queen, unless in the marked favour\r\nshown to the captains and officers of the Body Guards, who by this\r\nreduction became the only soldiers of their rank entrusted with the safety\r\nof the sovereign; or else in the Queen’s strong prejudice against the Duc\r\nd’Aiguillon, then commander of the light-horse.  M. de Saint-Germain,\r\nhowever, retained fifty gens d’armes and fifty light-horse to form a royal\r\nescort on state occasions; but in 1787 the King reduced both these\r\nmilitary bodies.  The Queen then said with satisfaction that at last she\r\nshould see no more red coats in the gallery of Versailles.\r\n\r\nFrom 1775 to 1781 were the gayest years of the Queen’s life.  In the\r\nlittle journeys to Choisy, performances frequently took place at the\r\ntheatre twice in one day: grand opera and French or Italian comedy at the\r\nusual hour; and at eleven at night they returned to the theatre for\r\nparodies in which the best actors of the Opera presented themselves in\r\nwhimsical parts and costumes.  The celebrated dancer Guimard always took\r\nthe leading characters in the latter performance; she danced better than\r\nshe acted; her extreme leanness, and her weak, hoarse voice added to the\r\nburlesque in the parodied characters of Ernelinde and Iphigenie.\r\n\r\nThe most magnificent fete ever given to the Queen was one prepared for her\r\nby Monsieur, the King’s brother, at Brunoy.  That Prince did me the honour\r\nto admit me, and I followed her Majesty into the gardens, where she found\r\nin the first copse knights in full armour asleep at the foot of trees, on\r\nwhich hung their spears and shields.  The absence of the beauties who had\r\nincited the nephews of Charlemagne and the gallants of that period to\r\nlofty deeds was supposed to occasion this lethargic slumber.  But when the\r\nQueen appeared at the entrance of the copse they were on foot in an\r\ninstant, and melodious voices announced their eagerness to display their\r\nvalour.  They then hastened into a vast arena, magnificently decorated in\r\nthe exact style of the ancient tournaments. Fifty dancers dressed as pages\r\npresented to the knights twenty-five superb black horses, and twenty-five\r\nof a dazzling whiteness, all most richly caparisoned.  The party led by\r\nAugustus Vestris wore the Queen’s colours.  Picq, balletmaster at the\r\nRussian Court, commanded the opposing band.  There was running at the\r\nnegro’s head, tilting, and, lastly, combats ‘a outrance’, perfectly well\r\nimitated.  Although the spectators were aware that the Queen’s colours\r\ncould not but be victorious, they did not the less enjoy the apparent\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\nNearly all the agreeable women of Paris were ranged upon the steps which\r\nsurrounded the area of the tourney.  The Queen, surrounded by the royal\r\nfamily and the whole Court, was placed beneath an elevated canopy.  A\r\nplay, followed by a ballet-pantomime and a ball, terminated the fete.\r\nFireworks and illuminations were not spared.  Finally, from a prodigiously\r\nhigh scaffold, placed on a rising ground, the words ‘Vive Louis!  Vive\r\nMarie Antoinette!’  were shown in the air in the midst of a very dark but\r\ncalm night.\r\n\r\nPleasure was the sole pursuit of every one of this young family, with the\r\nexception of the King.  Their love of it was perpetually encouraged by a\r\ncrowd of those officious people who, by anticipating the desires and even\r\nthe passions of princes, find means of showing their zeal, and hope to\r\ngain or maintain favour for themselves.\r\n\r\nWho would have dared to check the amusements of a queen, young, lively,\r\nand handsome?  A mother or a husband alone would have had the right to do\r\nit; and the King threw no impediment in the way of Marie Antoinette’s\r\ninclinations.  His long indifference had been followed by admiration and\r\nlove.  He was a slave to all the wishes of the Queen, who, delighted with\r\nthe happy change in the heart and habits of the King, did not sufficiently\r\nconceal the ascendency she was gaining over him.\r\n\r\nThe King went to bed every night at eleven precisely; he was very\r\nmethodical, and nothing was allowed to interfere with his rules.  The\r\nnoise which the Queen unavoidably made when she returned very late from\r\nthe evenings which she spent with the Princesse de Gugmenee or the Duc de\r\nDuras, at last annoyed the King, and it was amicably agreed that the Queen\r\nshould apprise him when she intended to sit up late.  He then began to\r\nsleep in his own apartment, which had never before happened from the time\r\nof their marriage.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter the Queen attended the Opera balls with a single lady of\r\nthe palace, and always found there Monsieur and the Comte d’Artois. Her\r\npeople concealed their liveries under gray cloth greatcoats.  She never\r\nthought she was recognized, while all the time she was known to the whole\r\nassembly, from the first moment she entered the theatre; they pretended,\r\nhowever, not to recognise her, and some masquerade manoeuvre was always\r\nadopted to give her the pleasure of fancying herself incognito.\r\n\r\nLouis XVI. determined once to accompany the Queen to a masked ball; it was\r\nagreed that the King should hold not only the grand but the petit coucher,\r\nas if actually going to bed.  The Queen went to his apartment through the\r\ninner corridors of the palace, followed by one of her women with a black\r\ndomino; she assisted him to put it on, and they went alone to the chapel\r\ncourt, where a carriage waited for them, with the captain of the Guard of\r\nthe quarter, and a lady of the palace.  The King was but little amused,\r\nspoke only to two or three persons, who knew him immediately, and found\r\nnothing to admire at the masquerade but Punches and Harlequins, which\r\nserved as a joke against him for the royal family, who often amused\r\nthemselves with laughing at him about it.\r\n\r\nAn event, simple in itself, brought dire suspicion upon the Queen.  She\r\nwas going out one evening with the Duchesse de Lupnes, lady of the palace,\r\nwhen her carriage broke down at the entrance into Paris; she was obliged\r\nto alight; the Duchess led her into a shop, while a footman called a\r\n‘fiacre’.  As they were masked, if they had but known how to keep silence,\r\nthe event would never have been known; but to ride in a fiacre is so\r\nunusual an adventure for a queen that she had hardly entered the\r\nOpera-house when she could not help saying to some persons whom she met\r\nthere: “That I should be in a fiacre!  Is it not droll?”\r\n\r\nFrom that moment all Paris was informed of the adventure of the fiacre. It\r\nwas said that everything connected with it was mysterious; that the Queen\r\nhad kept an assignation in a private house with the Duc de Coigny. He was\r\nindeed very well received at Court, but equally so by the King and Queen.\r\nThese accusations of gallantry once set afloat, there were no longer any\r\nbounds to the calumnies circulated at Paris.  If, during the chase or at\r\ncards, the Queen spoke to Lord Edward Dillon, De Lambertye, or others,\r\nthey were so many favoured lovers.  The people of Paris did not know that\r\nnone of those young persons were admitted into the Queen’s private circle\r\nof friends; the Queen went about Paris in disguise, and had made use of a\r\nfiacre; and a single instance of levity gives room for the suspicion of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nConscious of innocence, and well knowing that all about her must do\r\njustice to her private life, the Queen spoke of these reports with\r\ncontempt, contenting herself with the supposition that some folly in the\r\nyoung men mentioned had given rise to them.  She therefore left off\r\nspeaking to them or even looking at them.  Their vanity took alarm at\r\nthis, and revenge induced them either to say, or to leave others to think,\r\nthat they were unfortunate enough to please no longer.  Other young\r\ncoxcombs, placing themselves near the private box which the Queen occupied\r\nincognito when she attended the public theatre at Versailles, had the\r\npresumption to imagine that they were noticed by her; and I have known\r\nsuch notions entertained merely on account of the Queen’s requesting one\r\nof those gentlemen to inquire behind the scenes whether it would be long\r\nbefore the commencement of the second piece.\r\n\r\nThe list of persons received into the Queen’s closet which I gave in the\r\npreceding chapter was placed in the hands of the ushers of the chamber by\r\nthe Princesse de Lamballe; and the persons there enumerated could present\r\nthemselves to enjoy the distinction only on those days when the Queen\r\nchose to be with her intimates in a private manner; and this was only when\r\nshe was slightly indisposed.  People of the first rank at Court sometimes\r\nrequested special audiences of her; the Queen then received them in a room\r\nwithin that called the closet of the women on duty, and these women\r\nannounced them in her Majesty’s apartment.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Lauzun had a good deal of wit, and chivalrous manners.  The\r\nQueen was accustomed to see him at the King’s suppers, and at the house of\r\nthe Princesse de Guemenee, and always showed him attention.  One day he\r\nmade his appearance at Madame de Guemenee’s in uniform, and with the most\r\nmagnificent plume of white heron’s feathers that it was possible to\r\nbehold.  The Queen admired the plume, and he offered it to her through the\r\nPrincesse de Guemenee.  As he had worn it the Queen had not imagined that\r\nhe could think of giving it to her; much embarrassed with the present\r\nwhich she had, as it were, drawn upon herself, she did not like to refuse\r\nit, nor did she know whether she ought to make one in return; afraid, if\r\nshe did give anything, of giving either too much or too little, she\r\ncontented herself with once letting M. de Lauzun see her adorned with the\r\nplume.  In his secret “Memoirs” the Duke attaches an importance to his\r\npresent, which proves him utterly unworthy of an honour accorded only to\r\nhis name and rank.\r\n\r\nA short time afterwards he solicited an audience; the Queen granted it, as\r\nshe would have done to any other courtier of equal rank.  I was in the\r\nroom adjoining that in which he was received; a few minutes after his\r\narrival the Queen reopened the door, and said aloud, and in an angry tone\r\nof voice, “Go, monsieur.”  M. de Lauzun bowed low, and withdrew.  The\r\nQueen was much agitated.  She said to me: “That man shall never again come\r\nwithin my doors.”  A few years before the Revolution of 1789 the Marechal\r\nde Biron died.  The Duc de Lauzun, heir to his name, aspired to the\r\nimportant post of colonel of the regiment of French guards.  The Queen,\r\nhowever, procured it for the Duc du Chaatelet.  The Duc de Biron espoused\r\nthe cause of the Duc d’Orleans, and became one of the most violent enemies\r\nof Marie Antoinette.\r\n\r\nIt is with reluctance that I enter minutely on a defence of the Queen\r\nagainst two infamous accusations with which libellers have dared to swell\r\ntheir envenomed volumes.  I mean the unworthy suspicions of too strong an\r\nattachment for the Comte d’Artois, and of the motives for the tender\r\nfriendship which subsisted between the Queen, the Princesse de Lamballe,\r\nand the Duchesse de Polignac.  I do not believe that the Comte d’Artois\r\nwas, during his own youth and that of the Queen, so much smitten as has\r\nbeen said with the loveliness of his sister-in-law; I can affirm that I\r\nalways saw that Prince maintain the most respectful demeanour towards the\r\nQueen; that she always spoke of his good-nature and cheerfulness with that\r\nfreedom which attends only the purest sentiments; and that none of those\r\nabout the Queen ever saw in the affection she manifested towards the Comte\r\nd’Artois more than that of a kind and tender sister for her youngest\r\nbrother.  As to the intimate connection between Marie Antoinette and the\r\nladies I have named, it never had, nor could have, any other motive than\r\nthe very innocent wish to secure herself two friends in the midst of a\r\nnumerous Court; and notwithstanding this intimacy, that tone of respect\r\nobserved by persons of the most exalted rank towards majesty never ceased\r\nto be maintained.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, much occupied with the society of Madame de Polignac, and an\r\nunbroken series of amusements, found less time for the Abbe de Vermond; he\r\ntherefore resolved to retire from Court.  The world did him the honour to\r\nbelieve that he had hazarded remonstrances upon his august pupil’s\r\nfrivolous employment of her time, and that he considered himself, both as\r\nan ecclesiastic and as instructor, now out of place at Court.  But the\r\nworld was deceived his dissatisfaction arose purely from the favour shown\r\nto the Comtesse Jules.  After a fortnight’s absence we saw him at\r\nVersailles again, resuming his usual functions.\r\n\r\nThe Queen could express herself with winning graciousness to persons who\r\nmerited her praise.  When M. Loustonneau was appointed to the reversion of\r\nthe post of first surgeon to the King, he came to make his\r\nacknowledgments.  He was much beloved by the poor, to whom he had chiefly\r\ndevoted his talents, spending nearly thirty thousand francs a year on\r\nindigent sufferers.  The Queen replied to his thanks by saying: “You are\r\nsatisfied, Monsieur; but I am far from being so with the inhabitants of\r\nVersailles.  On the news of your appointment the town should have been\r\nilluminated.”--“How so, Madame?” asked the astonished surgeon, who was\r\nvery modest.  “Why,” replied the Queen, “if the poor whom you have\r\nsuccoured for the past twenty years had each placed a single candle in\r\ntheir windows it would have been the most beautiful illumination ever\r\nwitnessed.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen did not limit her kindness to friendly words.  There was\r\nfrequently seen in the apartments of Versailles a veteran captain of the\r\ngrenadiers of France, called the Chevalier d’Orville, who for four years\r\nhad been soliciting from the Minister of War the post of major, or of\r\nKing’s lieutenant.  He was known to be very poor; but he supported his lot\r\nwithout complaining of this vexatious delay in rewarding his honourable\r\nservices.  He regularly attended the Marechal de Segur, at the hour\r\nappointed for receiving the numerous solicitations in his department.  One\r\nday the Marshal said to him: “You are still at Versailles, M.\r\nd’Orville?”--“Monsieur,” he replied, “you may observe that by this board\r\nof the flooring where I regularly place myself; it is already worn down\r\nseveral lines by the weight of my body.”  The Queen frequently stood at\r\nthe window of her bedchamber to observe with her glass the people walking\r\nin the park.  Sometimes she inquired the names of those who were unknown\r\nto her.  One day she saw the Chevalier d’Orville passing, and asked me the\r\nname of that knight of Saint Louis, whom she had seen everywhere for a\r\nlong time past.  I knew who he was, and related his history.  “That must\r\nbe put an end to,” said the Queen, with some vivacity.  “Such an example\r\nof indifference is calculated to discourage our soldiers.”  Next day, in\r\ncrossing the gallery to go to mass, the Queen perceived the Chevalier\r\nd’Orville; she went directly towards him.  The poor man fell back in the\r\nrecess of a window, looking to the right and left to discover the person\r\nwhom the Queen was seeking, when she thus addressed him: “M. d’Orville,\r\nyou have been several years at Versailles, soliciting a majority or a\r\nKing’s lieutenancy.  You must have very powerless patrons.”--“I have none,\r\nMadame,” replied the Chevalier, in great confusion.  “Well! I will take\r\nyou under my protection.  To-morrow at the same hour be here with a\r\npetition, and a memorial of your services.”  A fortnight after, M.\r\nd’Orville was appointed King’s lieutenant, either at La Rochelle or at\r\nRochefort.\r\n\r\n[Louis XVI. vied with his Queen in benevolent actions of this kind. An old\r\nofficer had in vain solicited a pension during the administration of the\r\nDuc de Choiseul.  He returned to the charge in the times of the Marquis de\r\nMontesnard and the Duc d’Aiguillon.  He urged his claims, to Comte du Muy,\r\nwho made a note of them.  Tired of so many fruitless efforts, he at last\r\nappeared at the King’s supper, and, having placed himself so as to be seen\r\nand heard, cried out at a moment when silence prevailed, “Sire.”  The\r\npeople near him said, “What are you about?  This is not the way to speak\r\nto the King.”--“I fear nothing,” said he, and raising his voice, repeated,\r\n“Sire.”  The King, much surprised, looked at him and said, “What do you\r\nwant, monsieur.”--“Sire,” answered he, “I am seventy years of age; I have\r\nserved your Majesty more than fifty years, and I am dying for\r\nwant.”--“Have you a memorial?”  replied the King.  “Yes, Sire, I\r\nhave.”--“Give it to me;” and his Majesty took it without saying anything\r\nmore.  Next morning he was sent for by the, King, who said, “Monsieur, I\r\ngrant you an annuity of 1,500 livres out of my privy purse, and you may go\r\nand receive the first year’s payment, which is now due.”  (“Secret\r\nCorrespondence of the Court: Reign of Louis XVI.”) The King preferred to\r\nspend money in charity rather than in luxury or magnificence.  Once during\r\nhis absence, M. d’Augivillers caused an unused room in the King’s\r\napartment to be repaired at a cost of 30,000 francs.  On his return the\r\nKing made Versailles resound with complaints against M. d’Augivillers:\r\n“With that sum I could have made thirty families happy,” he said.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Louis XVI.’s accession to the throne, the Queen had been\r\nexpecting a visit from her brother, the Emperor Joseph II.  That Prince\r\nwas the constant theme of her discourse.  She boasted of his intelligence,\r\nhis love of occupation, his military knowledge, and the perfect simplicity\r\nof his manners.  Those about her Majesty ardently wished to see at\r\nVersailles a prince so worthy of his rank.  At length the coming of Joseph\r\nII., under the title of Count Falkenstein, was announced, and the very day\r\non which he would be at Versailles was mentioned.  The first embraces\r\nbetween the Queen and her august brother took place in the presence of all\r\nthe Queen’s household.  The sight of their emotion was extremely\r\naffecting.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was at first generally admired in France; learned men,\r\nwell-informed officers, and celebrated artists appreciated the extent of\r\nhis information.  He made less impression at Court, and very little in the\r\nprivate circle of the King and Queen.  His eccentric manners, his\r\nfrankness, often degenerating into rudeness, and his evidently affected\r\nsimplicity,--all these characteristics caused him to be looked upon as a\r\nprince rather singular than admirable.  The Queen spoke to him about the\r\napartment she had prepared for him in the Chateau; the Emperor answered\r\nthat he would not accept it, and that while travelling he always lodged at\r\na cabaret (that was his very expression); the Queen insisted, and assured\r\nhim that he should be at perfect liberty, and placed out of the reach of\r\nnoise.  He replied that he knew the Chateau of Versailles was very large,\r\nand that so many scoundrels lived there that he could well find a place;\r\nbut that his valet de chambre had made up his camp-bed in a lodging-house,\r\nand there he would stay.\r\n\r\nHe dined with the King and Queen, and supped with the whole family.  He\r\nappeared to take an interest in the young Princesse Elisabeth, then just\r\npast childhood, and blooming in all the freshness of that age.  An\r\nintended marriage between him and this young sister of the King was\r\nreported at the time, but I believe it had no foundation in truth.\r\n\r\nThe table was still served by women only, when the Queen dined in private\r\nwith the King, the royal family, or crowned heads.\r\n\r\n[The custom was, even supposing dinner to have commenced, if a princess of\r\nthe blood arrived, and she was asked to sit down at the Queen’s table, the\r\ncomptrollers and gentlemen-in-waiting came immediately to attend, and the\r\nQueen’s women withdrew.  These had succeeded the maids of honour in\r\nseveral parts of their service, and had preserved some of their\r\nprivileges.  One day the Duchesse d’Orleans arrived at Fontainebleau, at\r\nthe Queen’s dinner-hour.  The Queen invited her to the table, and herself\r\nmotioned to her women to leave the room, and let the men take their\r\nplaces.  Her Majesty said she was resolved to continue a privilege which\r\nkept places of that description most honourable, and render them suitable\r\nfor ladies of nobility without fortune.  Madame de Misery, Baronne de\r\nBiache, the Queen’s first lady of the chamber, to whom I was made\r\nreversioner, was a daughter of M. le Comte de Chemant, and her grandmother\r\nwas a Montmorency.  M. le Prince de Tingry, in the presence of the Queen,\r\nused to call her cousin.  The ancient household of the Kings of France had\r\nprerogatives acknowledged in the state.  Many of the offices were tenable\r\nonly by those of noble blood, and were sold at from 40,000 to 300,000\r\nfranca.  A collection of edicts of the Kings in favour of the prerogatives\r\nand right of precedence of the persons holding office in the royal\r\nhousehold is still in existence.]\r\n\r\nI was present at the Queen’s dinner almost every day.  The Emperor would\r\ntalk much and fluently; he expressed himself in French with facility, and\r\nthe singularity, of his expressions added a zest to his conversation.  I\r\nhave often heard him say that he liked spectaculous objects, when he meant\r\nto express such things as formed a show, or a scene worthy of interest.\r\nHe disguised none of his prejudices against the etiquette and customs of\r\nthe Court of France; and even in the presence of the King made them the\r\nsubject of his sarcasms.  The King smiled, but never made any answer; the\r\nQueen appeared pained.  The Emperor frequently terminated his observations\r\nupon the objects in Paris which he had admired by reproaching the King for\r\nsuffering himself to remain in ignorance of them.  He could not conceive\r\nhow such a wealth of pictures should remain shut up in the dust of immense\r\nstores; and told him one day that but for the practice of placing some of\r\nthem in the apartments of Versailles he would not know even the principal\r\nchef d’oeuvres that he possessed.\r\n\r\n[The Emperor loudly censured the existing practice of allowing shopkeepers\r\nto erect shops near the outward walls of all the palaces, and even to\r\nestablish something like a fair in the galleries of Versailles and\r\nFontainebleau, and even upon the landings of the staircases.]\r\n\r\nHe also reproached him for not having visited the Hotel des Invalides nor\r\nthe Ecole Militaire; and even went so far as to tell him before us that he\r\nought not only to know what Paris contained, but to travel in France, and\r\nreside a few days in each of his large towns.\r\n\r\nAt last the Queen was really hurt at the Emperor’s remarks, and gave him a\r\nfew lectures upon the freedom with which he allowed himself to lecture\r\nothers.  One day she was busied in signing warrants and orders for payment\r\nfor her household, and was conversing with M. Augeard, her secretary for\r\nsuch matters, who presented the papers one after another to be signed, and\r\nreplaced them in his portfolio.  While this was going forward, the Emperor\r\nwalked about the room; all at once he stood still, to reproach the Queen\r\nrather severely for signing all those papers without reading them, or, at\r\nleast, without running her eye over them; and he spoke most judiciously to\r\nher upon the danger of signing her name inconsiderately.  The Queen\r\nanswered that very wise principles might be very ill applied; that her\r\nsecretary, who deserved her implicit confidence, was at that moment laying\r\nbefore her nothing but orders for payment of the quarter’s expenses of her\r\nhousehold, registered in the Chamber of Accounts; and that she ran no risk\r\nof incautiously giving her signature.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s toilet was likewise a never-failing subject for animadversion\r\nwith the Emperor.  He blamed her for having introduced too many new\r\nfashions; and teased her about her use of rouge.  One day, while she was\r\nlaying on more of it than usual, before going to the play, he pointed out\r\na lady who was in the room, and who was, in truth, highly painted.  “A\r\nlittle more under the eyes,” said the Emperor to the Queen; “lay on the\r\nrouge like a fury, as that lady does.”  The Queen entreated her brother to\r\nrefrain from his jokes, or at all events to address them, when they were\r\nso outspoken, to her alone.\r\n\r\nThe Queen had made an appointment to meet her brother at the Italian\r\ntheatre; she changed her mind, and went to the French theatre, sending a\r\npage to the Italian theatre to request the Emperor to come to her there.\r\nHe left his box, lighted by the comedian Clairval, and attended by M. de\r\nla Ferte, comptroller of the Queen’s privy purse, who was much hurt at\r\nhearing his Imperial Majesty, after kindly expressing his regret at not\r\nbeing present during the Italian performance, say to Clairval, “Your young\r\nQueen is very giddy; but, luckily, you Frenchmen have no great objection\r\nto that.”\r\n\r\nI was with my father-in-law in one of the Queen’s apartments when the\r\nEmperor came to wait for her there, and, knowing that M. Campan was\r\nlibrarian, he conversed with him about such books as would of course be\r\nfound in the Queen’s library.  After talking of our most celebrated\r\nauthors, he casually said, “There are doubtless no works on finance or on\r\nadministration here?”\r\n\r\nThese words were followed by his opinion on all that had been written on\r\nthose topics, and the different systems of our two famous ministers, Sully\r\nand Colbert; on errors which were daily committed in France, in points\r\nessential to the prosperity of the Empire; and on the reform he himself\r\nwould make at Vienna.  Holding M. Campan by the button, he spent more than\r\nan hour, talking vehemently, and without the slightest reserve, about the\r\nFrench Government.  My father-in-law and myself maintained profound\r\nsilence, as much from astonishment as from respect; and when we were alone\r\nwe agreed not to speak of this interview.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was fond of describing the Italian Courts that he had visited.\r\nThe jealous quarrels between the King and Queen of Naples amused him\r\nhighly; he described to the life the manner and speech of that sovereign,\r\nand the simplicity with which he used to go and solicit the first\r\nchamberlain to obtain permission to return to the nuptial bed, when the\r\nangry Queen had banished him from it.  The time which he was made to wait\r\nfor this reconciliation was calculated between the Queen and her\r\nchamberlain, and always proportioned to the gravity of the offence.  He\r\nalso related several very amusing stories relative to the Court of Parma,\r\nof which he spoke with no little contempt.  If what this Prince said of\r\nthose Courts, and even of Vienna, had been written down, the whole would\r\nhave formed an interesting collection.  The Emperor told the King that the\r\nGrand Duke of Tuscany and the King of Naples being together, the former\r\nsaid a great deal about the changes he had effected in his State. The\r\nGrand Duke had issued a mass of new edicts, in order to carry the precepts\r\nof the economists into execution, and trusted that in so doing he was\r\nlabouring for the welfare of his people.  The King of Naples suffered him\r\nto go on speaking for a long time, and then casually asked how many\r\nNeapolitan families there were in Tuscany.  The Duke soon reckoned them\r\nup, as they were but few.  “Well, brother,” replied the King of Naples, “I\r\ndo not understand the indifference of your people towards your great\r\nreforms; for I have four times the number of Tuscan families settled in my\r\nStates that you have of Neapolitan families in yours.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen being at the Opera with the Emperor, the latter did not wish to\r\nshow himself; but she took him by the hand, and gently drew him to the\r\nfront of the box.  This kind of presentation to the public was most warmly\r\nreceived.  The performance was “Iphigenia in Aulis,” and for the second\r\ntime the chorus, “Chantons, celebrons notre Reine!” was called for with\r\nuniversal plaudits.\r\n\r\nA fete of a novel description was given at Petit Trianon.  The art with\r\nwhich the English garden was not illuminated, but lighted, produced a\r\ncharming effect.  Earthen lamps, concealed by boards painted green, threw\r\nlight upon the beds of shrubs and flowers, and brought out their varied\r\ntints.  Several hundred burning fagots in the moat behind the Temple of\r\nLove made a blaze of light, which rendered that spot the most brilliant in\r\nthe garden.  After all, this evening’s entertainment had nothing\r\nremarkable about it but the good taste of the artists, yet it was much\r\ntalked of.  The situation did not allow the admission of a great part of\r\nthe Court; those who were uninvited were dissatisfied; and the people, who\r\nnever forgive any fetes but those they share in, so exaggerated the cost\r\nof this little fete as to make it appear that the fagots burnt in the moat\r\nhad required the destruction of a whole forest.  The Queen being informed\r\nof these reports, was determined to know exactly how much wood had been\r\nconsumed; and she found that fifteen hundred fagots had sufficed to keep\r\nup the fire until four o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nAfter staying a few months the Emperor left France, promising his sister\r\nto come and see her again.  All the officers of the Queen’s chamber had\r\nmany opportunities of serving him during his stay, and expected that he\r\nwould make them presents before his departure.  Their oath of office\r\npositively forbade them to receive a gift from any foreign prince; they\r\nhad therefore agreed to refuse the Emperor’s presents at first, but to ask\r\nthe time necessary for obtaining permission to accept them.  The Emperor,\r\nprobably informed of this custom, relieved the good people from their\r\ndifficulty by setting off without making a single present.\r\n\r\nAbout the latter end of 1777 the Queen, being alone in her closet, sent\r\nfor my father-in-law and myself, and, giving us her hand to kiss; told us\r\nthat, looking upon us both as persons deeply interested in her happiness,\r\nshe wished to receive our congratulations,--that at length she was the\r\nQueen of France, and that she hoped soon to have children; that till now\r\nshe had concealed her grief, but that she had shed many tears in secret.\r\n\r\nDating from this happy but long-delayed moment, the King’s attachment to\r\nthe Queen assumed every characteristic of love.  The good Lassone, first\r\nphysician to the King and Queen, frequently spoke to me of the uneasiness\r\nthat the King’s indifference, the cause of which he had been so long in\r\novercoming, had given him, and appeared to me at that time to entertain no\r\nanxiety except of a very different description.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1778 the King’s permission for the return of Voltaire;\r\nafter an absence of twenty-seven years, was obtained.  A few strict\r\npersons considered this concession on the part of the Court very\r\ninjudicious.  The Emperor, on leaving France, passed by the Chateau of\r\nFerney without stopping there.  He had advised the Queen not to suffer\r\nVoltaire to be presented to her.  A lady belonging to the Court learned\r\nthe Emperor’s opinion on that point, and reproached him with his want of\r\nenthusiasm towards the greatest genius of the age.  He replied that for\r\nthe good of the people he should always endeavour to profit by the\r\nknowledge of the philosophers; but that his own business of sovereign\r\nwould always prevent his ranking himself amongst that sect.  The clergy\r\nalso took steps to hinder Voltaire’s appearance at Court.  Paris, however,\r\ncarried to the highest pitch the honours and enthusiasm shown to the great\r\npoet.\r\n\r\nIt was very unwise to let Paris pronounce with such transport an opinion\r\nso opposite to that of the Court.  This was pointed out to the Queen, and\r\nshe was told that, without conferring on Voltaire the honour of a\r\npresentation, she might see him in the State apartments.  She was not\r\naverse to following this advice, and appeared embarrassed solely about\r\nwhat she should say to him.  She was recommended to talk about nothing but\r\nthe “Henriade,” “Merope,” and “Zaira.”  The Queen replied that she would\r\nstill consult a few other persons in whom she had great confidence. The\r\nnext day she announced that it was irrevocably decided Voltaire should not\r\nsee any member of the royal family,--his writings being too antagonistic\r\nto religion and morals.  “It is, however, strange,” said the Queen, “that\r\nwhile we refuse to admit Voltaire into our presence as the leader of\r\nphilosophical writers, the Marechale de Mouchy should have presented to me\r\nsome years ago Madame Geoffrin, who owed her celebrity to the title of\r\nfoster-mother of the philosophers.”\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the duel of the Comte d’Artois with the Prince de\r\nBourbon the Queen determined privately to see the Baron de Besenval, who\r\nwas to be one of the witnesses, in order to communicate the King’s\r\nintentions.  I have read with infinite pain the manner in which that\r\nsimple fact is perverted in the first volume of M. de Besenval’s\r\n“Memoirs.”  He is right in saying that M. Campan led him through the upper\r\ncorridors of the Chateau, and introduced him into an apartment unknown to\r\nhim; but the air of romance given to the interview is equally culpable and\r\nridiculous.  M. de Besenval says that he found himself, without knowing\r\nhow he came there, in an apartment unadorned, but very conveniently\r\nfurnished, of the existence of which he was till then utterly ignorant.\r\nHe was astonished, he adds, not that the Queen should have so many\r\nfacilities, but that she should have ventured to procure them.  Ten\r\nprinted sheets of the woman Lamotte’s libels contain nothing so injurious\r\nto the character of Marie Antoinette as these lines, written by a man whom\r\nshe honoured by undeserved kindness.  He could not have had any\r\nopportunity of knowing the existence of the apartments, which consisted of\r\na very small antechamber, a bedchamber, and a closet.  Ever since the\r\nQueen had occupied her own apartment, these had been appropriated to her\r\nMajesty’s lady of honour in cases of illness, and were actually so used\r\nwhen the Queen was confined.  It was so important that it should not be\r\nknown the Queen had spoken to the Baron before the duel that she had\r\ndetermined to go through her inner room into this little apartment, to\r\nwhich M. Campan was to conduct him.  When men write of recent times they\r\nshould be scrupulously exact, and not indulge in exaggerations or\r\ninventions.\r\n\r\nThe Baron de Besenval appears mightily surprised at the Queen’s sudden\r\ncoolness, and refers it to the fickleness of her disposition.  I can\r\nexplain the reason for the change by repeating what her Majesty said to me\r\nat the time; and I will not alter one of her expressions.  Speaking of the\r\nstrange presumption of men, and the reserve with which women ought always\r\nto treat them, the Queen added that age did not deprive them of the hope\r\nof pleasing, if they retained any agreeable qualities; that she had\r\ntreated the Baron de Besenval as a brave Swiss, agreeable, polished, and\r\nwitty, whose gray hairs had induced her to look upon him as a man whom she\r\nmight see without harm; but that she had been much deceived. Her Majesty,\r\nafter having enjoined me to the strictest secrecy, told me that, finding\r\nherself alone with the Baron, he began to address her with so much\r\ngallantry that she was thrown into the utmost astonishment, and that he\r\nwas mad enough to fall upon his knees, and make her a declaration in form.\r\nThe Queen added that she said to him: “Rise, monsieur; the King shall be\r\nignorant of an offence which would disgrace you for ever;” that the Baron\r\ngrew pale and stammered apologies; that she left her closet without saying\r\nanother word, and that since that time she hardly ever spoke to him.  “It\r\nis delightful to have friends,” said the Queen; “but in a situation like\r\nmine it is sometimes difficult for the friends of our friends to suit us.”\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1778 Mademoiselle d’Eon obtained permission\r\nto return to France, on condition that she should appear there in female\r\ndress.  The Comte de Vergennes entreated my father, M. Genet, chief clerk\r\nof Foreign Affairs, who had long known the Chevalier d’Eon, to receive\r\nthat strange personage at his house, to guide and restrain, if possible,\r\nher ardent disposition.  The Queen, on learning her arrival at Versailles,\r\nsent a footman to desire my father to bring her into her presence; my\r\nfather thought it his duty first to inform the Minister of her Majesty’s\r\nwish.  The Comte de Vergennes expressed himself pleased with my father’s\r\nprudence, and desired that he would accompany him to the Queen.  The\r\nMinister had a few minutes’ audience; her Majesty came out of her closet\r\nwith him, and condescended to express to my father the regret she felt at\r\nhaving troubled him to no purpose; and added, smiling, that a few words\r\nfrom M. de Vergennes had for ever cured her of her curiosity. The\r\ndiscovery in London of the true sex of this pretended woman makes it\r\nprobable that the few words uttered by the Minister contained a solution\r\nof the enigma.\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier d’Eon had been useful in Russia as a spy of Louis XV. while\r\nvery young he had found means to introduce himself at the Court of the\r\nEmpress Elizabeth, and served that sovereign in the capacity of reader.\r\nResuming afterwards his military dress, he served with honour and was\r\nwounded.  Appointed chief secretary of legation, and afterwards minister\r\nplenipotentiary at London, he unpardonably insulted Comte de Guerchy, the\r\nambassador.  The official order for the Chevalier’s return to France was\r\nactually delivered to the King’s Council; but Louis XV. delayed the\r\ndeparture of the courier who was to be its bearer, and sent off another\r\ncourier privately, who gave the Chevalier d’Eon a letter in his own\r\nwriting, in which he said, “I know that you have served me as effectually\r\nin the dress of a woman as in that which you now wear. Resume it\r\ninstantly; withdraw into the city; I warn you that the King yesterday\r\nsigned an order for your return to France; you are not safe in your hotel,\r\nand you would here find too powerful enemies.”  I heard the Chevalier\r\nd’Eon repeat the contents of this letter, in which Louis XV. thus\r\nseparated himself from the King of France, several times at my father’s.\r\nThe Chevalier, or rather the Chevalaere d’Eon had preserved all the King’s\r\nletters.  Messieurs de Maurepas and de Vergennes wished to get them out of\r\nhis hands, as they were afraid he would print them.  This eccentric being\r\nhad long solicited permission to return to France; but it was necessary to\r\nfind a way of sparing the family he had offended the insult they would see\r\nin his return; he was therefore made to resume the costume of that sex to\r\nwhich in France everything is pardoned.  The desire to see his native land\r\nonce more determined him to submit to the condition, but he revenged\r\nhimself by combining the long train of his gown and the three deep ruffles\r\non his sleeves with the attitude and conversation of a grenadier, which\r\nmade him very disagreeable company.\r\n\r\n[The account given by Madame Campan of the Chevalier d’Eon is now known to\r\nbe incorrect in many particulars.  Enough details for most readers will be\r\nfound in the Duc de Broglie’s “Secret of the King,” vol.  ii., chaps.  vi.\r\nand g., and at p.  89, vol.  ii.  of that work, where the Duke refers to\r\nthe letter of most dubious authenticity spoken of by Madame Campan.  The\r\nfollowing details will be sufficient for these memoirs: The Chevalier\r\nCharles d’Eon de Beaumont (who was born in 1728) was an ex-captain of\r\ndragoons, employed in both the open and secret diplomacy of Louis XV.\r\nWhen at the embassy in London he quarrelled with the ambassador, his\r\nsuperior, the Comte de Guerchy (Marquis do Nangis), and used his\r\npossession of papers concerning the secret diplomacy to shield himself.\r\nIt was when hiding in London, in 1765, on account of this business, that\r\nhe seems first to have assumed woman’s dress, which he retained apparently\r\nchiefly from love of notoriety.  In 1775 a formal agreement with the\r\nFrench Court, made by the instrumentality of Beaumarchais, of all people\r\nin the world, permitted him to return to France, retaining the dress of a\r\nwoman.  He went back to France, but again came to England, and died there,\r\nat his residence in Millman Street, near the Foundling Hospital, May 22,\r\n1710.  He had been a brave and distinguished officer, but his form and a\r\ncertain coldness of temperament always remarked in him assisted him in his\r\nassumption of another sex.  There appears to be no truth in the story of\r\nhis proceedings at the Russian Court, and his appearing in female attire\r\nwas a surprise to those who must have known of any earlier affair of the\r\nsort.]\r\n\r\nAt last, the event so long desired by the Queen, and by all those who\r\nwished her well, took place; her Majesty became enceinte.  The King was in\r\necstasies.  Never was there a more united or happier couple.  The\r\ndisposition of Louis XVI. entirely altered, and became prepossessing and\r\nconciliatory; and the Queen was amply compensated for the uneasiness which\r\nthe King’s indifference during the early part of their union had caused\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1778 was extremely hot.  July and August passed, but the air\r\nwas not cooled by a single storm.  The Queen spent whole days in close\r\nrooms, and could not sleep until she had breathed the fresh night air,\r\nwalking with the Princesses and her brothers upon the terrace under her\r\napartments.  These promenades at first gave rise to no remark; but it\r\noccurred to some of the party to enjoy the music of wind instruments\r\nduring these fine summer nights.  The musicians belonging to the chapel\r\nwere ordered to perform pieces suited to instruments of that description,\r\nupon steps constructed in the middle of the garden.  The Queen, seated on\r\none of the terrace benches, enjoyed the effect of this music, surrounded\r\nby all the royal family with the exception of the King, who joined them\r\nbut, twice, disliking to change his hour of going to bed.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more innocent than these parties; yet Paris, France, nay,\r\nall Europe, were soon canvassing them in a manner most disadvantageous to\r\nthe reputation of Marie Antoinette.  It is true that all the inhabitants\r\nof Versailles enjoyed these serenades, and that there was a crowd near the\r\nspot from eleven at night until two or three in the morning.  The windows\r\nof the ground floor occupied by Monsieur and Madame--[The wife of\r\nMonsieur, the Comte de Provence.]--were kept open, and the terrace was\r\nperfectly well lighted by the numerous wax candles burning in the two\r\napartments.  Lamps were likewise placed in the garden, and the lights of\r\nthe orchestra illuminated the rest of the place.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether a few incautious women might not have ventured\r\nfarther, and wandered to the bottom of the park; it may have been so; but\r\nthe Queen, Madame, and the Comtesse d’Artois were always arm-in-arm, and\r\nnever left the terrace.  The Princesses were not remarkable when seated on\r\nthe benches, being dressed in cambric muslin gowns, with large straw hats\r\nand muslin veils, a costume universally adopted by women at that time; but\r\nwhen standing up their different figures always distinguished them; and\r\nthe persons present stood on one side to let them pass.  It is true that\r\nwhen they seated themselves upon the benches private individuals would\r\nsometimes, to their great amusement, sit down by their side.\r\n\r\nA young clerk in the War Department, either not knowing or pretending not\r\nto know the Queen, spoke to her of the beauty of the night, and the\r\ndelightful effect of the music.  The Queen, fancying she was not\r\nrecognised, amused herself by keeping up the incognito, and they talked of\r\nseveral private families of Versailles, consisting of persons belonging to\r\nthe King’s household or her own.  After a few minutes the Queen and\r\nPrincesses rose to walk, and on leaving the bench curtsied to the clerk.\r\nThe young man knowing, or having subsequently discovered, that he had been\r\nconversing with the Queen, boasted of it in his office. He was merely,\r\ndesired to hold his tongue; and so little attention did he excite that the\r\nRevolution found him still only a clerk.\r\n\r\nAnother evening one of Monsieur’s body-guard seated himself near the\r\nPrincesses, and, knowing them, left the place where he was sitting, and\r\nplaced himself before the Queen, to tell her that he was very fortunate in\r\nbeing able to seize an opportunity of imploring the kindness of his\r\nsovereign; that he was “soliciting at Court”--at the word soliciting the\r\nQueen and Princesses rose hastily and withdrew into Madame’s\r\napartment.--[Soulavie has most criminally perverted these two\r\nfacts.--MADAME CAMPAN.]--I was at the Queen’s residence that day.  She\r\ntalked of this little occurrence all the time of her ‘coucher’; though she\r\nonly complained that one of Monsieur’s guards should have had the\r\neffrontery to speak to her. Her Majesty added that he ought to have\r\nrespected her incognito; and that that was not the place where he should\r\nhave ventured to make a request. Madame had recognised him, and talked of\r\nmaking a complaint to his captain; the Queen opposed it, attributing his\r\nerror to his ignorance and provincial origin.\r\n\r\nThe most scandalous libels were based on these two insignificant\r\noccurrences, which I have related with scrupulous exactness.  Nothing\r\ncould be more false than those calumnies.  It must be confessed, however,\r\nthat such meetings were liable to ill consequences.  I ventured to say as\r\nmuch to the Queen, and informed her that one evening, when her Majesty\r\nbeckoned to me to go and speak to her, I thought I recognised on the bench\r\non which she was sitting two women deeply veiled, and keeping profound\r\nsilence; that those women were the Comtesse du Barry and her\r\nsister-in-law; and that my suspicions were confirmed, when, at a few paces\r\nfrom the seat, and nearer to her Majesty, I met a tall footman belonging\r\nto Madame du Barry, whom I had seen in her service all the time she\r\nresided at Court.\r\n\r\nMy advice was disregarded.  Misled by the pleasure she found in these\r\npromenades, and secure in the consciousness of blameless conduct, the\r\nQueen would not see the lamentable results which must necessarily follow.\r\nThis was very unfortunate; for besides the mortifications they brought\r\nupon her, it is highly probable that they prompted the vile plot which\r\ngave rise to the Cardinal de Rohan’s fatal error.\r\n\r\nHaving enjoyed these evening promenades about a month, the Queen ordered a\r\nprivate concert within the colonnade which contained the group of Pluto\r\nand Proserpine.  Sentinels were placed at all the entrances, and ordered\r\nto admit within the colonnade only such persons as should produce tickets\r\nsigned by my father-in-law.  A fine concert was performed there by the\r\nmusicians of the chapel and the female musicians belonging to the. Queen’s\r\nchamber.  The Queen went with Mesdames de Polignac, de Chalon, and\r\nd’Andlau, and Messieurs de Polignac, de Coigny, de Besenval, and de\r\nVaudreuil; there were also a few equerries present.  Her Majesty gave me\r\npermission to attend the concert with some of my female relations.  There\r\nwas no music upon the terrace.  The crowd of inquisitive people, whom the\r\nsentinels kept at a distance from the enclosure of the colonnade, went\r\naway highly discontented; the small number of persons admitted no doubt\r\noccasioned jealousy, and gave rise to offensive comments which were caught\r\nup by the public with avidity.  I do not pretend to apologise for the kind\r\nof amusements with which the Queen indulged herself during this and the\r\nfollowing summer; the consequences were so lamentable that the error was\r\nno doubt very great; but what I have said respecting the character of\r\nthese promenades may be relied on as true.\r\n\r\nWhen the season for evening walks was at an end, odious couplets were\r\ncirculated in Paris; the ‘Queen was treated in them in the most insulting\r\nmanner; her situation ranked among her enemies persons attached to the\r\nonly prince who for several years had appeared likely to give heirs to the\r\ncrown.  People uttered the most inconsiderate language; and those improper\r\nconversations took place in societies wherein the imminent danger of\r\nviolating to so criminal an extent both truth and the respect due to\r\nsovereigns ought to have been better understood.  A few days before the\r\nQueen’s confinement a whole volume of manuscript songs, concerning her and\r\nall the ladies about her remarkable for rank or station was, thrown down\r\nin the oiel-de-boeuf.--[A large room at Versailles lighted by a bull’s-eye\r\nwindow, and used as a waiting-room.]--This manuscript was immediately put\r\ninto the hands of the King, who was highly incensed at it, and said that\r\nhe had himself been at those promenades; that he had seen nothing\r\nconnected with them but what was perfectly harmless; that such songs would\r\ndisturb the harmony of twenty families in the Court and city; that it was\r\na capital crime to have made any against the Queen herself; and that he\r\nwished the author of the infamous libels to be discovered and punished.  A\r\nfortnight afterwards it was known publicly that the verses were by M.\r\nChampcenetz de Riquebourg, who was not even reprimanded.\r\n\r\n[The author of a great many songs, some of which are very well written.\r\nLively and satirical by nature, he did not lose either his cheerfulness or\r\nhis carelessness before the revolutionary tribunal. After hearing his own\r\nsentence read, he asked his judges if he might not be allowed to find a\r\nsubstitute.--MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nI knew for a certainty that the King spoke to M. de Maurepas, before two\r\nof his most confidential servants, respecting the risk which he saw the\r\nQueen ran from these night walks upon the terrace of Versailles, which the\r\npublic ventured to censure thus openly, and that the old minister had the\r\ncruelty to advise that she should be suffered to go on; she possessed\r\ntalent; her friends were very ambitious, and longed to see her take a part\r\nin public affairs; and to let her acquire the reputation of levity would\r\ndo no harm.  M. de Vergennes was as hostile to the Queen’s influence as M.\r\nde Maurepas.  It may therefore be fairly presumed, since the Prime\r\nMinister durst point out to his King an advantage to be gained by the\r\nQueen’s discrediting herself, that he and M. de Vergennes employed all\r\nmeans within the reach of powerful ministers in order to ruin her in the\r\nopinion of the public.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s accouchement approached; Te Deums were sung and prayers\r\noffered up in all the cathedrals.  On the 11th of December, 1778, the\r\nroyal family, the Princes of the blood, and the great officers of State\r\npassed the night in the rooms adjoining the Queen’s bedchamber.  Madame,\r\nthe King’s daughter, came into the world before mid-day on the 19th of\r\nDecember.--[Marie Therese Charlotte (1778-1861), Madame Royale; married in\r\n1799 Louis, Duc d’Angouleme, eldest son of the Comte d’Artois.]--The\r\netiquette of allowing all persons indiscriminately to enter at the moment\r\nof the delivery of a queen was observed with such exaggeration that when\r\nthe accoucheur said aloud, “La Reine va s’accoucher,” the persons who\r\npoured into the chamber were so numerous that the rush nearly destroyed\r\nthe Queen.  During the night the King had taken the precaution to have the\r\nenormous tapestry screens which surrounded her Majesty’s bed secured with\r\ncords; but for this they certainly would have been thrown down upon her.\r\nIt was impossible to move about the chamber, which was filled with so\r\nmotley a crowd that one might have fancied himself in some place of public\r\namusement.  Two Savoyards got upon the furniture for a better sight of the\r\nQueen, who was placed opposite the fireplace.\r\n\r\nThe noise and the sex of the infant, with which the Queen was made\r\nacquainted by a signal previously agreed on, as it is said, with the\r\nPrincesse do Lamballe, or some error of the accoucheur, brought on\r\nsymptoms which threatened fatal consequences; the accoucheur exclaimed,\r\n“Give her air--warm water--she must be bled in the foot!”  The windows\r\nwere stopped up; the King opened them with a strength which his affection\r\nfor the Queen gave him at the moment.  They were of great height, and\r\npasted over with strips of paper all round.  The basin of hot water not\r\nbeing brought quickly enough, the accoucheur desired the chief surgeon to\r\nuse his lancet without waiting for it.  He did so; the blood streamed out\r\nfreely, and the Queen opened her eyes.  The Princesse de Lamballe was\r\ncarried through the crowd in a state of insensibility.  The valets de\r\nchambre and pages dragged out by the collar such inconsiderate persons as\r\nwould not leave the room.  This cruel custom was abolished afterwards. The\r\nPrinces of the family, the Princes of the blood, the chancellor, and the\r\nministers are surely sufficient to attest the legitimacy of an hereditary\r\nprince.  The Queen was snatched from the very jaws of death; she was not\r\nconscious of having been bled, and on being replaced in bed asked why she\r\nhad a linen bandage upon her foot.\r\n\r\nThe delight which succeeded the moment of fear was equally lively and\r\nsincere.  We were all embracing each other, and shedding tears of joy. The\r\nComte d’Esterhazy and the Prince de Poix, to whom I was the first to\r\nannounce that the Queen was restored to life, embraced me in the midst of\r\nthe cabinet of nobles.  We little imagined, in our happiness at her escape\r\nfrom death, for how much more terrible a fate our beloved Princess was\r\nreserved.\r\n\r\nNOTE.  The two following specimens of the Emperor Joseph’s correspondence\r\nforcibly demonstrate the vigour, shrewdness, and originality of his mind,\r\nand complete the portrait left of him by Madame Campan.\r\n\r\nFew sovereigns have given their reasons for refusing appointments with the\r\nfullness and point of the following letter:\r\n\r\nTo a Lady.\r\n\r\nMADAM.--I do not think that it is amongst the duties of a monarch to grant\r\nplaces to one of his subjects merely because he is a gentleman. That,\r\nhowever, is the inference from the request you have made to me. Your late\r\nhusband was, you say, a distinguished general, a gentleman of good family,\r\nand thence you conclude that my kindness to your family can do no less\r\nthan give a company of foot to your second son, lately returned from his\r\ntravels.\r\n\r\nMadam, a man may be the son of a general and yet have no talent for\r\ncommand.  A man may be of a good family and yet possess no other merit\r\nthan that which he owes to chance,--the name of gentleman.\r\n\r\nI know your son, and I know what makes the soldier; and this twofold\r\nknowledge convinces me that your son has not the disposition of a warrior,\r\nand that he is too full of his birth to leave the country a hope of his\r\never rendering it any important service.\r\n\r\nWhat you are to be pitied for, madam, is, that your son is not fit either\r\nfor an officer, a statesman or a priest; in a word, that he is nothing\r\nmore than a gentleman in the most extended acceptation of the word.\r\n\r\nYou may be thankful to that destiny, which, in refusing talents to your\r\nson, has taken care to put him in possession of great wealth, which will\r\nsufficiently compensate him for other deficiencies, and enable him at the\r\nsame time to dispense with any favour from me.\r\n\r\nI hope you will be impartial enough to see the reasons which prompt me to\r\nrefuse your request.  It may be disagreeable to you, but I consider it\r\nnecessary.  Farewell, madam.--Your sincere well-wisher, JOSEPH\r\nLACHSENBURG, 4th August, 1787.\r\n\r\nThe application of another anxious and somewhat covetous mother was\r\nanswered with still more decision and irony:\r\n\r\nTo a Lady.\r\n\r\nMADAM.--You know my disposition; you are not ignorant that the society of\r\nthe ladies is to me a mere recreation, and that I have never sacrificed my\r\nprinciples to the fair sex.  I pay but little attention to\r\nrecommendations, and I only take them into consideration when the person\r\nin whose behalf I may be solicited possesses real merit.\r\n\r\nTwo of your sons are already loaded with favours.  The eldest, who is not\r\nyet twenty, is chief of a squadron in my army, and the younger has\r\nobtained a canonry at Cologne, from the Elector, my brother.  What would\r\nyou have more?  Would you have the first a general and the second a\r\nbishop?\r\n\r\nIn France you may see colonels in leading-strings, and in Spain the royal\r\nprinces command armies even at eighteen; hence Prince Stahremberg forced\r\nthem to retreat so often that they were never able all the rest of their\r\nlives to comprehend any other manoeuvre.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to be sincere at Court, and severe in the field, stoical\r\nwithout obduracy, magnanimous without weakness, and to gain the esteem of\r\nour enemies by the justice of our actions; and this, madam, is what I aim\r\nat. JOSEPH VIENNA, September, 1787.\r\n\r\n(From the inedited Letters of Joseph IL, published at Paris, by Persan,\r\n1822.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the alarm for the life of the Queen, regret at not possessing an\r\nheir to the throne was not even thought of.  The King himself was wholly\r\noccupied with the care of preserving an adored wife.  The young Princess\r\nwas presented to her mother.  “Poor little one,” said the Queen, “you were\r\nnot wished for, but you are not on that account less dear to me.  A son\r\nwould have been rather the property of the State.  You shall be mine; you\r\nshall have my undivided care, shall share all my happiness, and console me\r\nin all my troubles.”\r\n\r\nThe King despatched a courier to Paris, and wrote letters himself to\r\nVienna, by the Queen’s bedside; and part of the rejoicings ordered took\r\nplace in the capital.\r\n\r\nA great number of attendants watched near the Queen during the first\r\nnights of her confinement.  This custom distressed her; she knew how to\r\nfeel for others, and ordered large armchairs for her women, the backs of\r\nwhich were capable of being let down by springs, and which served\r\nperfectly well instead of beds.\r\n\r\nM. de Lassone, the chief physician, the chief surgeon, the chief\r\napothecary, the principal officers of the buttery, etc., were likewise\r\nnine nights without going to bed.  The royal children were watched for a\r\nlong time, and one of the women on duty remained, nightly, up and dressed,\r\nduring the first three years from their birth.\r\n\r\nThe Queen made her entry into Paris for the churching.  One hundred\r\nmaidens were portioned and married at Notre-Dame.  There were few popular\r\nacclamations, but her Majesty was perfectly well received at the Opera.\r\n\r\nA few days after the Queen’s recovery from her confinement, the Cure of\r\nthe Magdelaine de la City at Paris wrote to M. Campan and requested a\r\nprivate interview with him; it was to desire he would deliver into the\r\nhands of the Queen a little box containing her wedding ring, with this\r\nnote written by the Cure: “I have received under the seal of confession\r\nthe ring which I send to your Majesty; with an avowal that it was stolen\r\nfrom you in 1771, in order to be used in sorceries, to prevent your having\r\nany children.”  On seeing her ring again the Queen said that she had in\r\nfact lost it about seven years before, while washing her hands, and that\r\nshe had resolved to use no endeavour to discover the superstitious woman\r\nwho had done her the injury.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s attachment to the Comtesse Jules increased every day; she went\r\nfrequently to her house at Paris, and even took up her own abode at the\r\nChateau de la Muette to be nearer during her confinement.  She married\r\nMademoiselle de Polignac, when scarcely thirteen years of age, to M. de\r\nGrammont, who, on account of this marriage, was made Duc de Guiche, and\r\ncaptain of the King’s Guards, in reversion after the Duc de Villeroi. The\r\nDuchesse de Civrac, Madame Victoire’s dame d’honneur, had been promised\r\nthe place for the Duc de Lorges, her son.  The number of discontented\r\nfamilies at Court increased.\r\n\r\nThe title of favourite was too openly given to the Comtesse Jules by her\r\nfriends.  The lot of the favourite of a queen is not, in France, a happy\r\none; the favourites of kings are treated, out of gallantry, with much\r\ngreater indulgence.\r\n\r\nA short time after the birth of Madame the Queen became again enceinte;\r\nshe had mentioned it only to the King, to her physician, and to a few\r\npersons honoured with her intimate confidence, when, having overexerted\r\nher strength in pulling lip one of the glasses of her carriage, she felt\r\nthat she had hurt herself, and eight days afterwards she miscarried.  The\r\nKing spent the whole morning at her bedside, consoling her, and\r\nmanifesting the tenderest concern for her.  The Queen wept exceedingly;\r\nthe King took her affectionately in his arms, and mingled his tears with\r\nhers.  The King enjoined silence among the small number of persons who\r\nwere informed of this unfortunate occurrence; and it remained generally\r\nunknown.  These particulars furnish an accurate idea of the manner in\r\nwhich this august couple lived together.\r\n\r\nThe Empress Maria Theresa did not enjoy the happiness of seeing her\r\ndaughter give an heir to the crown of France.  That illustrious Princess\r\ndied at the close of 1780, after having proved by her example that, as in\r\nthe instance of Queen Blanche, the talents of a sovereign might be blended\r\nwith the virtues of a pious princess.  The King was deeply affected at the\r\ndeath of the Empress; and on the arrival of the courier from Vienna said\r\nthat he could not bring himself to afflict the Queen by informing her of\r\nan event which grieved even him so much.  His Majesty thought the Abbe de\r\nVermond, who had possessed the confidence of Maria Theresa during his stay\r\nat Vienna, the most proper person to discharge this painful duty.  He sent\r\nhis first valet de chambre, M. de Chamilly, to the Abbe on the evening of\r\nthe day he received the despatches from Vienna, to order him to come the\r\nnext day to the Queen before her breakfast hour, to acquit himself\r\ndiscreetly of the afflicting commission with which he was charged, and to\r\nlet his Majesty know the moment of his entering the Queen’s chamber.  It\r\nwas the King’s intention to be there precisely a quarter of an hour after\r\nhim, and he was punctual to his time; he was announced; the Abbe came out;\r\nand his Majesty said to him, as he drew up at the door to let him pass, “I\r\nthank you, Monsieur l’Abbe, for the service you have just done me.”  This\r\nwas the only time during nineteen years that the King spoke to him.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour after learning the event the Queen put on temporary\r\nmourning, while waiting until her Court mourning should be ready; she kept\r\nherself shut up in her apartments for several days; went out only to mass;\r\nsaw none but the royal family; and received none but the Princesse de\r\nLamballe and the Duchesse de Polignac.  She talked incessantly of the\r\ncourage, the misfortunes, the successes, and the virtues of her mother.\r\nThe shroud and dress in which Maria Theresa was to be buried, made\r\nentirely by her own hands, were found ready prepared in one of her\r\nclosets.  She often regretted that the numerous duties of her august\r\nmother had prevented her from watching in person over the education of her\r\ndaughters; and modestly said that she herself would have been more worthy\r\nif she had had the good fortune to receive lessons directly from a\r\nsovereign so enlightened and so deserving of admiration.\r\n\r\nThe Queen told me one day that her mother was left a widow at an age when\r\nher beauty was yet striking; that she was secretly informed of a plot laid\r\nby her three principal ministers to make themselves agreeable to her; of a\r\ncompact made between them, that the losers should not feel any jealousy\r\ntowards him who should be fortunate enough to gain his sovereign’s heart;\r\nand that they had sworn that the successful one should be always the\r\nfriend of the other two.  The Empress being assured of this scheme, one\r\nday after the breaking up of the council over which she had presided,\r\nturned the conversation upon the subject of female sovereigns, and the\r\nduties of their sex and rank; and then applying her general reflections to\r\nherself in particular, told them that she hoped to guard herself all her\r\nlife against weaknesses of the heart; but that if ever an irresistible\r\nfeeling should make her alter her resolution, it should be only in favour\r\nof a man proof against ambition, not engaged in State affairs, but\r\nattached only to a private life and its calm enjoyments,--in a word, if\r\nher heart should betray her so far as to lead her to love a man invested\r\nwith any important office, from the moment he should discover her\r\nsentiments he would forfeit his place and his influence with the public.\r\nThis was sufficient; the three ministers, more ambitious than amorous,\r\ngave up their projects for ever.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of October, 1781, the Queen gave birth to a Dauphin.--[The\r\nfirst Dauphin, Louis, born 1781, died 1789.]--So deep a silence prevailed\r\nin the room that the Queen thought her child was a daughter; but after the\r\nKeeper of the Seals had declared the sex of the infant, the King went up\r\nto the Queen’s bed, and said to her, “Madame, you have fulfilled my wishes\r\nand those of France: you are the mother of a Dauphin.”  The King’s joy was\r\nboundless; tears streamed from his eyes; he gave his hand to every one\r\npresent; and his happiness carried away his habitual reserve.  Cheerful\r\nand affable, he was incessantly taking occasion to introduce the words,\r\n“my son,” or “the Dauphin.”  As soon as the Queen was in bed, she wished\r\nto see the long-looked-for infant.  The Princesse de Guemenee brought him\r\nto her.  The Queen said there was no need for commending him to the\r\nPrincess, but in order to enable her to attend to him more freely, she\r\nwould herself share the care of the education of her daughter.  When the\r\nDauphin was settled in his apartment, he received the customary homages\r\nand visits.  The Duc d’Angouleme,  meeting his father at the entrance of\r\nthe Dauphin’s apartment, said to him, “Oh, papa! how little my cousin\r\nis!”--“The day will come when you will think him great enough, my dear,”\r\n answered the Prince, almost involuntarily.--[Eldest son of the Comte\r\nd’Artois, and till the birth of the Dauphin with near prospects of the\r\nsuccession.]\r\n\r\nThe birth of the Dauphin appeared to give joy to all classes.  Men stopped\r\none another in the streets, spoke without being acquainted, and those who\r\nwere acquainted embraced each other.  In the birth of a legitimate heir to\r\nthe sovereign every man beholds a pledge of prosperity and tranquillity.\r\n\r\n[M. Merard de Saint Just made a quatrain on the birth of the Dauphin to\r\nthe following effect:\r\n\r\n“This infant Prince our hopes are centred in, will doubtless make us\r\nhappy, rich, and free; And since with somebody he must begin, My fervent\r\nprayer is--that it may be me!”\r\n\r\n--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThe rejoicings were splendid and ingenious.  The artificers and tradesmen\r\nof Paris spent considerable sums in order to go to Versailles in a body,\r\nwith their various insignia.  Almost every troop had music with it.  When\r\nthey arrived at the court of the palace, they there arranged themselves so\r\nas to present a most interesting living picture.  Chimney-sweepers, quite\r\nas well dressed as those that appear upon the stage, carried an ornamented\r\nchimney, at the top of which was perched one of the smallest of their\r\nfraternity.  The chairmen carried a sedan highly gilt, in which were to be\r\nseen a handsome nurse and a little Dauphin.  The butchers made their\r\nappearance with their fat ox.  Cooks, masons, blacksmiths, all trades were\r\non the alert.  The smiths hammered away upon an anvil, the shoemakers\r\nfinished off a little pair of boots for the Dauphin, and the tailors a\r\nlittle suit of the uniform of his regiment.  The King remained a long time\r\nupon a balcony to enjoy the sight.  The whole Court was delighted with it.\r\nSo general was the enthusiasm that (the police not having carefully\r\nexamined the procession) the grave-diggers had the imprudence to send\r\ntheir deputation also, with the emblematic devices of their ill-omened\r\noccupation.  They were met by the Princesse Sophie, the King’s aunt, who\r\nwas thrilled with horror at the sight, and entreated the King to have the\r\naudacious, fellows driven out of the procession, which was then drawing up\r\non the terrace.\r\n\r\nThe ‘dames de la halle’ came to congratulate the Queen, and were received\r\nwith the suitable ceremonies.\r\n\r\nFifty of them appeared dressed in black silk gowns, the established full\r\ndress of their order, and almost all wore diamonds.  The Princesse de\r\nChimay went to the door of the Queen’s bedroom to receive three of these\r\nladies, who were led up to the Queen’s bed.  One of them addressed her\r\nMajesty in a speech written by M. de la Harpe.  It was set down on the\r\ninside of a fan, to which the speaker repeatedly referred, but without any\r\nembarrassment.  She was handsome, and had a remarkably fine voice. The\r\nQueen was affected by the address, and answered it with great\r\naffability,--wishing a distinction to be made between these women and the\r\npoissardes, who always left a disagreeable impression on her mind.\r\n\r\nThe King ordered a substantial repast for all these women.  One of his\r\nMajesty’s maitres d’hotel, wearing his hat, sat as president and did the\r\nhonours of the table.  The public were admitted, and numbers of people had\r\nthe curiosity to go.\r\n\r\nThe Garden-du-Corps obtained the King’s permission to give the Queen a\r\ndress ball in the great hall of the Opera at Versailles.  Her Majesty\r\nopened the ball in a minuet with a private selected by the corps, to whom\r\nthe King granted the baton of an exempt.  The fete was most splendid. All\r\nthen was joy, happiness, and peace.\r\n\r\nThe Dauphin was a year old when the Prince de Guemenee’s bankruptcy\r\ncompelled the Princess, his wife, who was governess to the children of\r\nFrance, to resign her situation.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was at La Muette for the inoculation of her daughter.  She sent\r\nfor me, and condescended to say she wished to converse with me about a\r\nscheme which delighted her, but in the execution of which she foresaw some\r\ninconveniences.  Her plan was to appoint the Duchesse de Polignac to the\r\noffice lately held by the Princesse de Guemenee.  She saw with extreme\r\npleasure the facilities which this appointment would give her for\r\nsuperintending the education of her children, without running any risk of\r\nhurting the pride of the governess; and that it would bring together the\r\nobjects of her warmest affections, her children and her friend.  “The\r\nfriends of the Duchesse de Polignac,” continued the Queen, “will be\r\ngratified by the splendour and importance conferred by the employment. As\r\nto the Duchess, I know her; the place by no means suits her simple and\r\nquiet habits, nor the sort of indolence of her disposition.  She will give\r\nme the greatest possible proof of her devotion if she yields to my wish.”\r\n The Queen also spoke of the Princesse de Chimay and the Duchesse de Duras,\r\nwhom the public pointed out as fit for the post; but she thought the\r\nPrincesse de Chimay’s piety too rigid; and as to the Duchesse de Duras,\r\nher wit and learning quite frightened her.  What the Queen dreaded as the\r\nconsequence of her selection of the Duchesse de Polignac was principally\r\nthe jealousy of the courtiers; but she showed so lively a desire to see\r\nher scheme executed that I had no doubt she would soon set at naught all\r\nthe obstacles she discovered.  I was not mistaken; a few days afterwards\r\nthe Duchess was appointed governess.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s object in sending for me was no doubt to furnish me with the\r\nmeans of explaining the feelings which induced her to prefer a governess\r\ndisposed by friendship to suffer her to enjoy all the privileges of a\r\nmother.  Her Majesty knew that I saw a great deal of company.\r\n\r\nThe Queen frequently dined with the Duchess after having been present at\r\nthe King’s private dinner.  Sixty-one thousand francs were therefore added\r\nto the salary of the governess as a compensation for this increase of\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was tired of the excursions to Marly, and had no great\r\ndifficulty in setting the King against them.  He did not like the expense\r\nof them, for everybody was entertained there gratis.  Louis XIV. had\r\nestablished a kind of parade upon these excursions, differing from that of\r\nVersailles, but still more annoying.  Card and supper parties occurred\r\nevery day, and required much dress.  On Sundays and holidays the fountains\r\nplayed, the people were admitted into the gardens, and there was as great\r\na crowd as at the fetes of St. Cloud.\r\n\r\nEvery age has its peculiar colouring; Marly showed that of Louis XIV. even\r\nmore than Versailles.  Everything in the former place appeared to have\r\nbeen produced by the magic power of a fairy’s wand.  Not the slightest\r\ntrace of all this splendour remains; the revolutionary spoilers even tore\r\nup the pipes which served to supply the fountains.  Perhaps a brief\r\ndescription of this palace and the usages established there by Louis XIV.\r\nmay be acceptable.\r\n\r\nThe very extensive gardens of Marly ascended almost imperceptibly to the\r\nPavilion of the Sun., which was occupied only by the King and his family.\r\nThe pavilions of the twelve zodiacal signs bounded the two sides of the\r\nlawn.  They were connected by bowers impervious to the rays of the sun.\r\nThe pavilions nearest to that of the sun were reserved for the Princes of\r\nthe blood and the ministers; the rest were occupied by persons holding\r\nsuperior offices at Court, or invited to stay at Marly.  Each pavilion was\r\nnamed after fresco paintings, which covered its walls, and which had been\r\nexecuted by the most celebrated artists of the age of Louis XIV. On a line\r\nwith the upper pavilion there was on the left a chapel; on the right a\r\npavilion called La Perspective, which concealed along suite of offices,\r\ncontaining a hundred lodging-rooms intended for the persons belonging to\r\nthe service of the Court, kitchens, and spacious dining-rooms, in which\r\nmore than thirty tables were splendidly laid out.\r\n\r\nDuring half of Louis XV.’s reign the ladies still wore the habit de cour\r\nde Marly, so named by Louis XIV., and which differed little from, that\r\ndevised for Versailles.  The French gown, gathered in the back, and with\r\ngreat hoops, replaced this dress, and continued to be worn till the end of\r\nthe reign of Louis XVI.  The diamonds, feathers, rouge, and embroidered\r\nstuffs spangled with gold, effaced all trace of a rural residence; but the\r\npeople loved to see the splendour of their sovereign and a brilliant Court\r\nglittering in the shades of the woods.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, and before the hour for cards, the Queen, the Princesses,\r\nand their ladies, paraded among the clumps of trees, in little carriages,\r\nbeneath canopies richly embroidered with gold, drawn by men in the King’s\r\nlivery.  The trees planted by Louis XIV. were of prodigious height, which,\r\nhowever, was surpassed in several of the groups by fountains of the\r\nclearest water; while, among others, cascades over white marble, the\r\nwaters of which, met by the sunbeams, looked like draperies of silver\r\ngauze, formed a contrast to the solemn darkness of the groves.\r\n\r\nIn the evening nothing more was necessary for any well-dressed man to\r\nprocure admission to the Queen’s card parties than to be named and\r\npresented, by some officer of the Court, to the gentleman usher of the\r\ncard-room.  This room, which was very, large, and of octagonal shape, rose\r\nto the top of the Italian roof, and terminated in a cupola furnished with\r\nbalconies, in which ladies who had not been presented easily obtained\r\nleave to place themselves, and enjoy, the sight of the brilliant\r\nassemblage.\r\n\r\nThough not of the number of persons belonging to the Court, gentlemen\r\nadmitted into this salon might request one of the ladies seated with the\r\nQueen at lansquenet or faro to bet upon her cards with such gold or notes\r\nas they presented to her.  Rich people and the gamblers of Paris did not\r\nmiss one of the evenings at the Marly salon, and there were always\r\nconsiderable sums won and lost.  Louis XVI.  hated high play, and very\r\noften showed displeasure when the loss of large sums was mentioned.  The\r\nfashion of wearing a black coat without being in mourning had not then\r\nbeen introduced, and the King gave a few of his ‘coups de boutoir’ to\r\ncertain chevaliers de St. Louis, dressed in this manner, who came to\r\nventure two or three louis, in the hope that fortune would favour the\r\nhandsome duchesses who deigned to place them on their cards.\r\n\r\n[Bachaumont in his “Memoirs,” (tome xii., p. 189), which are often\r\nsatirical; and always somewhat questionable, speaks of the singular\r\nprecautions taken at play at Court.  “The bankers at the Queen’s table,”\r\n says he, “in order to prevent the mistakes [I soften the harshness of his\r\nexpression] which daily happen, have obtained permission from her Majesty\r\nthat before beginning to play the table shall be bordered by a ribbon\r\nentirely round it, and that no other money than that upon the cards beyond\r\nthe ribbon shall be considered as staked.”--NOTE By THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nSingular contrasts are often seen amidst the grandeur of courts.  In order\r\nto manage such high play at the Queen’s faro table, it was necessary to\r\nhave a banker provided with large, sums of money; and this necessity\r\nplaced at the table, to which none but the highest titled persons were\r\nadmitted in general, not only M. de Chalabre, who was its banker, but also\r\na retired captain of foot, who officiated as his second. A word, trivial,\r\nbut perfectly appropriate to express the manner in which the Court was\r\nattended there, was often heard.  Gentlemen presented at Court, who had\r\nnot been invited to stay at Marly, came there notwithstanding, as they did\r\nto Versailles, and returned again to Paris; under such circumstances, it\r\nwas said such a one had been to Marly only ‘en polisson’;--[A contemptuous\r\nexpression, meaning literally “as a scamp” or “rascal”]--and it appeared\r\nodd to hear a captivating marquis, in answer to the inquiry whether he was\r\nof the royal party at Marly, say, “No, I am only here ‘en polisson’,”\r\n meaning simply “I am here on the footing of all those whose nobility is of\r\na later date than 1400.”  The Marly excursions were exceedingly expensive\r\nto the King.  Besides the superior tables, those of the almoners,\r\nequerries, maitres d’hotel, etc., were all supplied with such a degree of\r\nmagnificence as to allow of inviting strangers to them; and almost all the\r\nvisitors from Paris were boarded at the expense of the Court.\r\n\r\nThe personal frugality of the unfortunate Prince who sank beneath the\r\nweight of the national debts thus favoured the Queen’s predilection for\r\nher Petit Trianon; and for five or six years preceding the Revolution the\r\nCourt very seldom visited Marly.\r\n\r\nThe King, always attentive to the comfort of his family, gave Mesdames,\r\nhis aunts, the use of the Chateau de Bellevue, and afterwards purchased\r\nthe Princesse de Guemenee’s house, at the entrance to Paris, for\r\nElisabeth.  The Comtesse de Provence bought a small house at Montreuil;\r\nMonsieur already had Brunoy; the Comtesse d’Artois built Bagatelle;\r\nVersailles became, in the estimation of all the royal family, the least\r\nagreeable of residences.  They only fancied themselves at home in the\r\nplainest houses, surrounded by English gardens, where they better enjoyed\r\nthe beauties of nature.  The taste for cascades and statues was entirely\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThe Queen occasionally remained a whole month at Petit Trianon, and had\r\nestablished there all the ways of life in a chateau.  She entered the\r\nsitting-room without driving the ladies from their pianoforte or\r\nembroidery.  The gentlemen continued their billiards or backgammon without\r\nsuffering her presence to interrupt them.  There was but little room in\r\nthe small Chateau of Trianon.  Madame Elisabeth accompanied the Queen\r\nthere, but the ladies of honour and ladies of the palace had no\r\nestablishment at Trianon.  When invited by the Queen, they came from\r\nVersailles to dinner.  The King and Princes came regularly to sup.  A\r\nwhite gown, a gauze kerchief, and a straw hat were the uniform dress of\r\nthe Princesses.\r\n\r\n[The extreme simplicity of the Queen’s toilet began to be strongly\r\ncensured, at first among the courtiers, and afterwards throughout the\r\nkingdom; and through one of those inconsistencies more common in France\r\nthan elsewhere, while the Queen was blamed, she was blindly imitated.\r\nThere was not a woman but would have the same undress, the same cap, and\r\nthe same feathers as she had been seen to wear. They crowded to\r\nMademoiselle Bertin, her milliner; there was an absolute revolution in the\r\ndress of our ladies, which gave importance to that woman.  Long trains,\r\nand all those fashions which confer a certain nobility on dress, were\r\ndiscarded; and at last a duchess could not be distinguished from an\r\nactress.  The men caught the mania; the upper classes had long before\r\ngiven up to their lackeys feathers, tufts of ribbon, and laced hats.  They\r\nnow got rid of red heels and embroidery; and walked about our streets in\r\nplain cloth, short thick shoes, and with knotty cudgels in their hands.\r\nMany humiliating scrapes were the consequence of this metamorphosis.\r\nBearing no mark to distinguish them from the common herd, some of the\r\nlowest classes got into quarrels with them, in which the nobles had not\r\nalways the best of it.--MONTJOIE, “History of Marie Antoinette.”]\r\n\r\nExamining all the manufactories of the hamlet, seeing the cows milked, and\r\nfishing in the lake delighted the Queen; and every year she showed\r\nincreased aversion to the pompous excursions to Marly.\r\n\r\nThe idea of acting comedies, as was then done in almost all country\r\nhouses, followed on the Queen’s wish to live at Trianon without ceremony.\r\n\r\n[The Queen got through the characters she assumed indifferently enough;\r\nshe could hardly be ignorant of this, as her performances evidently\r\nexcited little pleasure.  Indeed, one day while she was thus exhibiting,\r\nsomebody ventured to say, by no means inaudibly, “well, this is royally\r\nill played!”  The lesson was thrown away upon her, for never did she\r\nsacrifice to the opinion of another that which she thought permissible.\r\nWhen she was told that her extreme plainness in dress, the nature of her\r\namusements, and her dislike to that splendour which ought always to attend\r\na Queen, had an appearance of levity, which was misinterpreted by a\r\nportion of the public, she replied with Madame de Maintenon: “I am upon\r\nthe stage, and of course I shall be either hissed or applauded.”  Louis\r\nXIV. had a similar taste; he danced upon the stage; but he had shown by\r\nbrilliant actions that he knew how to enforce respect; and besides, he\r\nunhesitatingly gave up the amusement from the moment he heard those\r\nbeautiful lines in which Racine pointed out how very unworthy of him such\r\npastimes were.--MONTJOIE, “History of Marie Antoinette.”]\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that no young man except the Comte d’Artois should be\r\nadmitted into the company of performers, and that the audience should\r\nconsist only of the King, Monsieur, and the Princesses, who did not play;\r\nbut in order to stimulate the actors a little, the first boxes were to be\r\noccupied by the readers, the Queen’s ladies, their sisters and daughters,\r\nmaking altogether about forty persons.\r\n\r\nThe Queen laughed heartily at the voice of M. d’Adhemar, formerly a very\r\nfine one, but latterly become rather tremulous.  His shepherd’s dress in\r\nColin, in the “Devin du Village,” contrasted very ridiculously with his\r\ntime of life, and the Queen said it would be difficult for malevolence\r\nitself to find anything to criticise in the choice of such a lover. The\r\nKing was highly amused with these plays, and was present at every\r\nperformance.  Caillot, a celebrated actor, who had long quitted the stage,\r\nand Dazincourt, both of acknowledged good character, were selected to give\r\nlessons, the first in comic opera, of which the easier sorts were\r\npreferred, and the second in comedy.  The office of hearer of rehearsals,\r\nprompter, and stage manager was given to my father-in-law.  The Duc de\r\nFronsac, first gentleman of the chamber, was much hurt at this.  He\r\nthought himself called upon to make serious remonstrances upon the\r\nsubject, and wrote to the Queen, who made him the following answer: “You\r\ncannot be first gentleman when we are the actors.  Besides, I have already\r\nintimated to you my determination respecting Trianon.  I hold no court\r\nthere, I live like a private person, and M. Campan shall be always\r\nemployed to execute orders relative to the private fetes I choose to give\r\nthere.”  This not putting a stop to the Duke’s remonstrances, the King was\r\nobliged to interfere.  The Duke continued obstinate, and insisted that he\r\nwas entitled to manage the private amusements as much as those which were\r\npublic.  It became absolutely necessary to end the argument in a positive\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe diminutive Duc de Fronsac never failed, when he came to pay his\r\nrespects to the Queen at her toilet, to turn the conversation upon\r\nTrianon, in order to make some ironical remarks on my father-in-law, of\r\nwhom, from the time of his appointment, he always spoke as “my colleague\r\nCampan.”  The Queen would shrug her shoulders, and say, when he was gone,\r\n“It is quite shocking to find so little a man in the son of the Marechal\r\nde Richelieu.”\r\n\r\nSo long as no strangers were admitted to the performances they were but\r\nlittle censured; but the praise obtained by the performers made them look\r\nfor a larger circle of admirers.  The company, for a private company, was\r\ngood enough, and the acting was applauded to the skies; nevertheless, as\r\nthe audience withdrew, adverse criticisms were occasionally heard.  The\r\nQueen permitted the officers of the Body Guards and the equerries of the\r\nKing and Princes to be present at the plays.  Private boxes were provided\r\nfor some of the people belonging to the Court; a few more ladies were\r\ninvited; and claims arose on all sides for the favour of admission.  The\r\nQueen refused to admit the officers of the body guards of the Princes, the\r\nofficers of the King’s Cent Suisses, and many other persons, who were\r\nhighly mortified at the refusal.\r\n\r\nWhile delight at having given an heir to the throne of the Bourbons, and a\r\nsuccession of fetes and amusements, filled up the happy days of Marie\r\nAntoinette, the public was engrossed by the Anglo-American war.  Two\r\nkings, or rather their ministers, planted and propagated the love of\r\nliberty in the new world; the King of England, by shutting his ears and\r\nhis heart against the continued and respectful representations of subjects\r\nat a distance from their native land, who had become numerous, rich, and\r\npowerful, through the resources of the soil they had fertilised; and the\r\nKing of France, by giving support to this people in rebellion against\r\ntheir ancient sovereign.  Many young soldiers, belonging to the first\r\nfamilies of the country, followed La Fayette’s example, and forsook\r\nluxury, amusement, and love, to go and tender their aid to the revolted\r\nAmericans.  Beaumarchais, secretly seconded by Messieurs de Maurepas and\r\nde Vergennes, obtained permission to send out supplies of arms and\r\nclothing.  Franklin appeared at Court in the dress of an American\r\nagriculturist.  His unpowdered hair, his round hat, his brown cloth coat\r\nformed a contrast to the laced and embroidered coats and the powder and\r\nperfume of the courtiers of Versailles.  This novelty turned the light\r\nheads of the Frenchwomen.  Elegant entertainments were given to Doctor\r\nFranklin, who, to the reputation of a man of science, added the patriotic\r\nvirtues which invested him with the character of an apostle of liberty.  I\r\nwas present at one of these entertainments, when the most beautiful woman\r\nout of three hundred was selected to place a crown of laurels upon the\r\nwhite head of the American philosopher, and two kisses upon his cheeks.\r\nEven in the palace of Versailles Franklin’s medallion was sold under the\r\nKing’s eyes, in the exhibition of Sevres porcelain.  The legend of this\r\nmedallion was:\r\n\r\n“Eripuit coelo fulmen, sceptrumque tyrannis.”\r\n\r\nThe King never declared his opinion upon an enthusiasm which his correct\r\njudgment no doubt led him to blame.  The Queen spoke out more plainly\r\nabout the part France was taking respecting the independence of the\r\nAmerican colonies, and constantly opposed it.  Far was she from foreseeing\r\nthat a revolution at--such a distance could excite one in which a\r\nmisguided populace would drag her from her palace to a death equally\r\nunjust and cruel.  She only saw something ungenerous in the method which\r\nFrance adopted of checking the power of England.\r\n\r\nHowever, as Queen of France, she enjoyed the sight of a whole people\r\nrendering homage to the prudence, courage, and good qualities of a young\r\nFrenchman; and she shared the enthusiasm inspired by the conduct and\r\nmilitary success of the Marquis de La Fayette.  The Queen granted him\r\nseveral audiences on his first return from America, and, until the 10th of\r\nAugust, on which day my house was plundered, I preserved some lines from\r\nGaston and Bayard, in which the friends of M. de La Fayette saw the exact\r\noutline of his character, written by her own hand:\r\n\r\n         “Why talk of youth,\r\n          When all the ripe experience of the old\r\n          Dwells with him?  In his schemes profound and cool,\r\n          He acts with wise precaution, and reserves\r\n          For time of action his impetuous fire.\r\n          To guard the camp, to scale the leaguered wall,\r\n          Or dare the hottest of the fight, are toils\r\n          That suit th’ impetuous bearing of his youth;\r\n          Yet like the gray-hair’d veteran he can shun\r\n          The field of peril.  Still before my eyes\r\n          I place his bright example, for I love\r\n          His lofty courage, and his prudent thought.\r\n          Gifted like him, a warrior has no age.”\r\n\r\n[During the American war a general officer in the service of the United\r\nStates advanced with a score of men under the English batteries to\r\nreconnoitre their position.  His aide-de-camp, struck by a ball, fell at\r\nhis side.  The officers and orderly dragoons fled precipitately.  The\r\ngeneral, though under the fire of the cannon, approached the wounded man\r\nto see whether any help could be afforded him.  Finding the wound had been\r\nmortal, he slowly rejoined the group which had got out of the reach of the\r\ncannon.  This instance of courage and humanity took place at the battle of\r\nMonmouth. General Clinton, who commanded the English troops, knew that the\r\nMarquis de La Fayette generally rode a white horse; it was upon a white\r\nhorse that the general officer who retired so slowly was mounted; Clinton\r\ndesired the gunners not to fire.  This noble forbearance probably saved M.\r\nde La Fayette’s life, for he it was. At that time he was but twenty-two\r\nyears of age.--“Historical Anecdotes of the Reign of Louis XVI.”]\r\n\r\nThese lines had been applauded and encored at the French theatre;\r\neverybody’s head was turned.  There was no class of persons that did not\r\nheartily approve of the support given openly by the French Government to\r\nthe cause of American independence.  The constitution planned for the new\r\nnation was digested at Paris, and while liberty, equality, and the rights\r\nof man were commented upon by the Condorcets, Baillys, Mirabeaus, etc.,\r\nthe minister Segur published the King’s edict, which, by repealing that of\r\n1st November, 1750, declared all officers not noble by four generations\r\nincapable of filling the rank of captain, and denied all military rank to\r\nthe roturiers, excepting sons of the chevaliers de St. Louis.\r\n\r\n[“M. de Segur,” says Chamfort, “having published an ordinance which\r\nprohibited the admission of any other than gentlemen into the artillery\r\ncorps, and, on the other hand, none but well-educated persons being proper\r\nfor admission, a curious scene took place: the Abbe Bossat, examiner of\r\nthe pupils, gave certificates only to plebeians, while Cherin gave them\r\nonly to gentlemen.  Out of one hundred pupils, there were not above four\r\nor five who were qualified in both respects.”]\r\n\r\nThe injustice and absurdity of this law was no doubt a secondary cause of\r\nthe Revolution.  To understand the despair and rage with which this law\r\ninspired the Tiers Etat one should have belonged to that honourable class.\r\nThe provinces were full of roturier families, who for ages had lived as\r\npeople of property upon their own domains, and paid the taxes. If these\r\npersons had several sons, they would place one in the King’s service, one\r\nin the Church, another in the Order of Malta as a chevalier servant\r\nd’armes, and one in the magistracy; while the eldest preserved the\r\npaternal manor, and if he were situated in a country celebrated for wine,\r\nhe would, besides selling his own produce, add a kind of commission trade\r\nin the wines of the canton.  I have seen an individual of this justly\r\nrespected class, who had been long employed in diplomatic business, and\r\neven honoured with the title of minister plenipotentiary, the son-in-law\r\nand nephew of colonels and town mayors, and, on his mother’s side, nephew\r\nof a lieutenant-general with a cordon rouge, unable to introduce his sons\r\nas sous-lieutenants into a regiment of foot.\r\n\r\nAnother decision of the Court, which could not be announced by an edict,\r\nwas that all ecclesiastical benefices, from the humblest priory up to the\r\nrichest abbey, should in future be appanages of the nobility.  Being the\r\nson of a village surgeon, the Abbe de Vermond, who had great influence in\r\nthe disposition of benefices, was particularly struck with the justice of\r\nthis decree.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of the Abbe in an excursion he made for his health, I\r\nprevailed on the Queen to write a postscript to the petition of a cure,\r\none of my friends, who was soliciting a priory near his curacy, with the\r\nintention of retiring to it.  I obtained it for him.  On the Abbe’s return\r\nhe told me very harshly that I should act in a manner quite contrary to\r\nthe King’s wishes if I again obtained such a favour; that the wealth of\r\nthe Church was for the future to be invariably devoted to the support of\r\nthe poorer nobility; that it was the interest of the State that it should\r\nbe so; and a plebeian priest, happy in a good curacy, had only to remain\r\ncurate.\r\n\r\nCan we be astonished at the part shortly afterwards taken by the deputies\r\nof the Third Estate, when called to the States General?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the close of the last century several of the Northern sovereigns\r\ntook a fancy for travelling.  Christian III., King of Denmark, visited the\r\nCourt of France in 1763, during the reign of Louis XV.  We have seen the\r\nKing of Sweden and Joseph II.  at Versailles.  The Grand Duke of Russia\r\n(afterwards Paul I.), son of Catherine II., and the Princess of\r\nWurtemberg, his wife, likewise resolved to visit France.  They travelled\r\nunder the titles of the Comte and Comtesse du Nord.  They were presented\r\non the 20th of May, 1782.  The Queen received them with grace and dignity.\r\nOn the day of their arrival at Versailles they dined in private with the\r\nKing and Queen.\r\n\r\nThe plain, unassuming appearance of Paul I. pleased Louis XVI.  He spoke\r\nto him with more confidence and cheerfulness than he had spoken to Joseph\r\nII.  The Comtesse du Nord was not at first so successful with the Queen.\r\nThis lady was of a fine height, very fat for her age, with all the German\r\nstiffness, well informed, and perhaps displaying her acquirements with\r\nrather too much confidence.  When the Comte and Comtesse du Nord were\r\npresented the Queen was exceedingly nervous.  She withdrew into her closet\r\nbefore she went into the room where she was to dine with the illustrious\r\ntravellers, and asked for a glass of water, confessing “she had just\r\nexperienced how much more difficult it was to play the part of a queen in\r\nthe presence of other sovereigns, or of princes born to become so, than\r\nbefore courtiers.”  She soon recovered from her confusion, and reappeared\r\nwith ease and confidence.  The dinner was tolerably cheerful, and the\r\nconversation very animated.\r\n\r\nBrilliant entertainments were given at Court in honour of the King of\r\nSweden and the Comte du Nord.  They were received in private by the King\r\nand Queen, but they were treated with much more ceremony than the Emperor,\r\nand their Majesties always appeared to me to be very, cautious before\r\nthese personages.  However, the King one day asked the Russian Grand Duke\r\nif it were true that he could not rely on the fidelity of any one of those\r\nwho accompanied him.  The Prince answered him without hesitation, and\r\nbefore a considerable number of persons, that he should be very sorry to\r\nhave with him even a poodle that was much attached to him, because his\r\nmother would take care to have it thrown into the Seine, with a stone\r\nround its neck, before he should leave Paris.  This reply, which I myself\r\nheard, horrified me, whether it depicted the disposition of Catherine, or\r\nonly expressed the Prince’s prejudice against her.\r\n\r\nThe Queen gave the Grand Duke a supper at Trianon, and had the gardens\r\nilluminated as they had been for the Emperor.  The Cardinal de Rohan very\r\nindiscreetly ventured to introduce himself there without the Queen’s\r\nknowledge.  Having been treated with the utmost coolness ever since his\r\nreturn from Vienna, he had not dared to ask her himself for permission to\r\nsee the illumination; but he persuaded the porter of Trianon to admit him\r\nas soon as the Queen should have set off for Versailles, and his Eminence\r\nengaged to remain in the porter’s lodge until all the carriages should\r\nhave left the chateau.  He did not keep his word, and while the porter was\r\nbusy in the discharge of his duty, the Cardinal, who wore his red\r\nstockings and had merely thrown on a greatcoat, went down into the garden,\r\nand, with an air of mystery, drew up in two different places to see the\r\nroyal family and suite pass by.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty was highly offended at this piece of boldness, and next day\r\nordered the porter to be discharged.  There was a general feeling of\r\ndisgust at the Cardinal’s conduct, and of commiseration towards the porter\r\nfor the loss of his place.  Affected at the misfortune of the father of a\r\nfamily, I obtained his forgiveness; and since that time I have often\r\nregretted the feeling which induced me to interfere.  The notoriety of the\r\ndischarge of the porter of Trianon, and the odium that circumstance would\r\nhave fixed upon the Cardinal, would have made the Queen’s dislike to him\r\nstill more publicly known, and would probably have prevented the\r\nscandalous and notorious intrigue of the necklace.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, who was much prejudiced against the King of Sweden, received\r\nhim very coldly.\r\n\r\n[Gustavus III., King of Sweden, travelled in France under the title of\r\nComte d’Haga.  Upon his accession to the throne, he managed the revolution\r\nwhich prostrated the authority of the Senate with equal skill, coolness,\r\nand courage.  He was assassinated in 1792, at a masked ball, by\r\nAuckarstrum.--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nAll that was said of the private character of that sovereign, his\r\nconnection with the Comte de Vergennes, from the time of the Revolution of\r\nSweden, in 1772, the character of his favourite Armfeldt, and the\r\nprejudices of the monarch himself against the Swedes who were well\r\nreceived at the Court of Versailles, formed the grounds of this dislike.\r\nHe came one day uninvited and unexpected, and requested to dine with the\r\nQueen.  The Queen received him in the little closet, and desired me to\r\nsend for her clerk of the kitchen, that she might be informed whether\r\nthere was a proper dinner to set before Comte d’Haga, and add to it if\r\nnecessary.  The King of Sweden assured her that there would be enough for\r\nhim; and I could not help smiling when I thought of the length of the menu\r\nof the dinner of the King and Queen, not half of which would have made its\r\nappearance had they dined in private.  The Queen looked significantly at\r\nme, and I withdrew.  In the evening she asked me why I had seemed so\r\nastonished when she ordered me to add to her dinner, saying that I ought\r\ninstantly to have seen that she was giving the King of Sweden a lesson for\r\nhis presumption.  I owned to her that the scene had appeared to me so much\r\nin the bourgeois style, that I involuntarily thought of the cutlets on the\r\ngridiron, and the omelette, which in families in humble circumstances\r\nserve to piece out short commons.  She was highly diverted with my answer,\r\nand repeated it to the King, who also laughed heartily at it.\r\n\r\nThe peace with England satisfied all classes of society interested in the\r\nnational honour.  The departure of the English commissary from Dunkirk,\r\nwho had been fixed at that place ever since the shameful peace of 1763 as\r\ninspector of our navy, occasioned an ecstasy of joy.\r\n\r\n[By the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) it was stipulated that the fortifications\r\nand port of Dunkirk should be destroyed.  By the Treaty of Paris (1763) a\r\ncommissary was to reside at Dunkirk to see that no attempt was made to\r\nbreak this treaty.  This stipulation was revoked by the Peace of\r\nVersailles, in 1783.--see DYER’S “Modern Europe,” 1st edition, vol. i.,\r\npp.  205-438 and 539.]\r\n\r\nThe Government communicated to the Englishman the order for his departure\r\nbefore the treaty was made public.  But for that precaution the populace\r\nwould have probably committed some excess or other, in order to make the\r\nagent of English power feel the effects of the resentment which had\r\nconstantly increased during his stay at that port.  Those engaged in trade\r\nwere the only persons dissatisfied with the treaty of 1783.  That article\r\nwhich provided for, the free admission of English goods annihilated at one\r\nblow the trade of Rouen and the other manufacturing towns throughout the\r\nkingdom.  The English swarmed into Paris.  A considerable number of them\r\nwere presented at Court.  The Queen paid them marked attention; doubtless\r\nshe wished them to distinguish between the esteem she felt for their noble\r\nnation and the political views of the Government in the support it had\r\nafforded to the Americans.  Discontent was, however, manifested at Court\r\nin consequence of the favour bestowed by the Queen on the English\r\nnoblemen; these attentions were called infatuations.  This was illiberal;\r\nand the Queen justly complained of such absurd jealousy.\r\n\r\nThe journey to Fontainebleau and the winter at Paris and at Court were\r\nextremely brilliant.  The spring brought back those amusements which the\r\nQueen began to prefer to the splendour of fetes.  The most perfect harmony\r\nsubsisted between the King and Queen; I never saw but one cloud between\r\nthem.  It was soon dispelled, and the cause of it is perfectly unknown to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMy father-in-law, whose penetration and experience I respected greatly,\r\nrecommended me, when he saw me placed in the service of a young queen, to\r\nshun all kinds of confidence.  “It procures,” said he, “but a very\r\nfleeting, and at the same time dangerous sort of favour; serve with zeal\r\nto the best of your judgment, but never do more than obey.  Instead of\r\nsetting your wits to work to discover why an order or a commission which\r\nmay appear of consequence is given to you, use them to prevent the\r\npossibility of your knowing anything of the matter.”  I had occasion to\r\nact on this wise advice.  One morning at Trianon I went into the Queen’s\r\nchamber; there were letters lying upon the bed, and she was weeping\r\nbitterly.  Her tears and sobs were occasionally interrupted by\r\nexclamations of “Ah! that I were dead!--wretches! monsters! What have I\r\ndone to them?”  I offered her orange-flower water and ether.  “Leave me,”\r\n said she, “if you love me; it would be better to kill me at once.”  At\r\nthis moment she threw her arm over my shoulder and began weeping afresh. I\r\nsaw that some weighty trouble oppressed her heart, and that she wanted a\r\nconfidant.  I suggested sending for the Duchesse de Polignac; this she\r\nstrongly opposed.  I renewed my arguments, and her opposition grew weaker.\r\nI disengaged myself from her arms, and ran to the antechamber, where I\r\nknew that an outrider always waited, ready to mount and start at a\r\nmoment’s warning for Versailles.  I ordered him to go full speed, and tell\r\nthe Duchesse de Polignac that the Queen was very uneasy, and desired to\r\nsee her instantly.  The Duchess always had a carriage ready.  In less than\r\nten minutes she was at the Queen’s door.  I was the only person there,\r\nhaving been forbidden to send for the other women.  Madame de Polignac\r\ncame in; the Queen held out her arms to her, the Duchess rushed towards\r\nher.  I heard her sobs renewed and withdrew.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour afterwards the Queen, who had become calmer, rang to\r\nbe dressed.  I sent her woman in; she put on her gown and retired to her\r\nboudoir with the Duchess.  Very soon afterwards the Comte d’Artois arrived\r\nfrom Compiegne, where he had been with the King.  He eagerly inquired\r\nwhere the Queen was; remained half an hour with her and the Duchess; and\r\non coming out told me the Queen asked for me.  I found her seated on the\r\ncouch by the side of her friend; her features had resumed their usual\r\ncheerful and gracious appearance.  She held out her hand to me, and said\r\nto the Duchess, “I know I have made her so uncomfortable this morning that\r\nI must set her poor heart at ease.”  She then added, “You must have seen,\r\non some fine summer’s day, a black cloud suddenly appear and threaten to\r\npour down upon the country and lay it waste.  The lightest wind drives it\r\naway, and the blue sky and serene weather are restored.  This is just the\r\nimage of what has happened to me this morning.”  She afterwards told me\r\nthat the King would return from Compiegne after hunting there, and sup\r\nwith her; that I must send for her purveyor, to select with him from his\r\nbills of fare all such dishes as the King liked best; that she would have\r\nno others served up in the evening at her table; and that this was a mark\r\nof attention that she wished the King to notice.  The Duchesse de Polignac\r\nalso took me by the hand, and told me how happy she was that she had been\r\nwith the Queen at a moment when she stood in need of a friend.  I never\r\nknew what could have created in the Queen so lively and so transient an\r\nalarm; but I guessed from the particular care she took respecting the King\r\nthat attempts had been made to irritate him against her; that the malice\r\nof her enemies had been promptly discovered and counteracted by the King’s\r\npenetration and attachment; and that the Comte d’Artois had hastened to\r\nbring her intelligence of it.\r\n\r\nIt was, I think, in the summer of 1787, during one of the Trianon\r\nexcursions, that the Queen of Naples--[Caroline, sister of Marie\r\nAntoinette.]--sent the Chevalier de Bressac to her Majesty on a secret\r\nmission relative to a projected marriage between the Hereditary Prince,\r\nher son, and Madame, the King’s daughter; in the absence of the lady of\r\nhonour he addressed himself to me.  Although he said a great deal to me\r\nabout the close confidence with which the Queen of Naples honoured him,\r\nand about his letter of credit, I thought he had the air of an\r\nadventurer.--[He afterwards spent several years shut up in the Chateau de\r\nl’Oeuf.]--He had, indeed, private letters for the Queen, and his mission\r\nwas not feigned; he talked to me very rashly even before his admission,\r\nand entreated me to do all that lay in my power to dispose the Queen’s\r\nmind in favour of his sovereign’s wishes; I declined, assuring him that it\r\ndid not become me to meddle with State affairs. He endeavoured, but in\r\nvain, to prove to me that the union contemplated by the Queen of Naples\r\nought not to be looked upon in that light.\r\n\r\nI procured M. de Bressac the audience he desired, but without suffering\r\nmyself even to seem acquainted with the object of his mission.  The Queen\r\ntold me what it was; she thought him a person ill-chosen for the occasion;\r\nand yet she thought that the Queen, her sister, had done wisely in not\r\nsending a man worthy to be avowed,--it being impossible that what she\r\nsolicited should take place.  I had an opportunity on this occasion, as\r\nindeed on many others, of judging to what extent the Queen valued and\r\nloved France and the dignity of our Court.  She then told me that Madame,\r\nin marrying her cousin, the Duc d’Angouleme, would not lose her rank as\r\ndaughter of the Queen; and that her situation would be far preferable to\r\nthat of queen of any other country; and that there was nothing in Europe\r\nto be compared to the Court of France; and that it would be necessary, in\r\norder to avoid exposing a French Princess to feelings of deep regret, in\r\ncase she should be married to a foreign prince, to take her from the\r\npalace of Versailles at seven years of age, and send her immediately to\r\nthe Court in which she was to dwell; and that at twelve would be too late;\r\nfor recollections and comparisons would ruin the happiness of all the rest\r\nof her life.  The Queen looked upon the destiny of her sisters as far\r\nbeneath her own; and frequently mentioned the mortifications inflicted by\r\nthe Court of Spain upon her sister, the Queen of Naples, and the necessity\r\nshe was under of imploring the mediation of the King of France.\r\n\r\nShe showed me several letters that she had received from the Queen of\r\nNaples relative to her differences with the Court of Madrid respecting the\r\nMinister Acton.  She thought him useful to her people, inasmuch as he was\r\na man of considerable information and great activity.  In these letters\r\nshe minutely acquainted her Majesty with the nature of the affronts she\r\nhad received, and represented Mr. Acton to her as a man whom malevolence\r\nitself could not suppose capable of interesting her otherwise than by his\r\nservices.  She had had to suffer the impertinences of a Spaniard named Las\r\nCasas, who had been sent to her by the King, her father-in-law, to\r\npersuade her to dismiss Mr. Acton from the business of the State, and from\r\nher intimacy.  She complained bitterly to the Queen, her sister, of the\r\ninsulting proceedings of this charge d’affaires, whom she told, in order\r\nto convince him of the nature of the feelings which attached her to Mr.\r\nActon, that she would have portraits and busts of him executed by the most\r\neminent artists of Italy, and that she would then send them to the King of\r\nSpain, to prove that nothing but the desire to retain a man of superior\r\ncapacity had induced her to bestow on him the favour he enjoyed.  This Las\r\nCasas dared to answer her that it would be useless trouble; that the\r\nugliness of a man did not always render him displeasing; and that the King\r\nof Spain had too much experience not to know that there was no accounting\r\nfor the caprices of a woman.\r\n\r\nThis audacious reply filled the Queen of Naples with indignation, and her\r\nemotion caused her to miscarry on the same day.  In consequence of the\r\nmediation of Louis XVI. the Queen of Naples obtained complete\r\nsatisfaction, and Mr. Acton continued Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nAmong the characteristics which denoted the goodness of the Queen, her\r\nrespect for personal liberty should have a place.  I have seen her put up\r\nwith the most troublesome importunities from people whose minds were\r\nderanged rather than have them arrested.  Her patient kindness was put to\r\na very disagreeable trial by an ex-councillor of the Bordeaux Parliament,\r\nnamed Castelnaux; this man declared himself the lover of the Queen, and\r\nwas generally known by that appellation.  For ten successive years did he\r\nfollow the Court in all its excursions.  Pale and wan, as people who are\r\nout of their senses usually are, his sinister appearance occasioned the\r\nmost uncomfortable sensations.  During the two hours that the Queen’s\r\npublic card parties lasted, he would remain opposite her Majesty.  He\r\nplaced himself in the same manner before her at chapel, and never failed\r\nto be at the King’s dinner or the dinner in public.  At the theatre he\r\ninvariably seated himself as near the Queen’s box as possible.  He always\r\nset off for Fontainebleau or St. Cloud the day before the Court, and when\r\nher Majesty arrived at her various residences, the first person she met on\r\ngetting out of her carriage was this melancholy madman, who never spoke to\r\nany one.  When the Queen stayed at Petit Trianon the passion of this\r\nunhappy man became still more annoying.  He would hastily swallow a morsel\r\nat some eating-house, and spend all the rest of the day, even when it\r\nrained, in going round and round the garden, always walking at the edge of\r\nthe moat.  The Queen frequently met him when she was either alone or with\r\nher children; and yet she would not suffer any violence to be used to\r\nrelieve her from this intolerable annoyance.  Having one day given M. de\r\nSeze permission to enter Trianon, she sent to desire he would come to me,\r\nand directed me to inform that celebrated advocate of M. de Castelnaux’s\r\nderangement, and then to send for him that M. de Seze might have some\r\nconversation with him.  He talked to him nearly an hour, and made\r\nconsiderable impression upon his mind; and at last M. de Castelnaux\r\nrequested me to inform the Queen positively that, since his presence was\r\ndisagreeable to her, he would retire to his province.  The Queen was very\r\nmuch rejoiced, and desired me to express her full satisfaction to M. de\r\nSeze.  Half an hour after M. de Seze was gone the unhappy madman was\r\nannounced.  He came to tell me that he withdrew his promise, that he had\r\nnot sufficient command of himself to give up seeing the Queen as often as\r\npossible.  This new determination: was a disagreeable message to take to\r\nher Majesty but how was I affected at hearing her say, “Well, let him\r\nannoy me!  but do not let him be deprived of the blessing of freedom.”\r\n\r\n[On the arrest of the King and Queen at Varennes, this unfortunate\r\nCastelnaux attempted to starve himself to death.  The people in whose\r\nhouse he lived, becoming uneasy at his absence, had the door of his room\r\nforced open, when he was found stretched senseless on the floor.  I do not\r\nknow what became of him after the 10th of August.--MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nThe direct influence of the Queen on affairs during the earlier years of\r\nthe reign was shown only in her exertions to obtain from the King a\r\nrevision of the decrees in two celebrated causes.  It was contrary to her\r\nprinciples to interfere in matters of justice, and never did she avail\r\nherself of her influence to bias the tribunals.  The Duchesse de Praslin,\r\nthrough a criminal caprice, carried her enmity to her husband so far as to\r\ndisinherit her children in favour of the family of M. de Guemenee. The\r\nDuchesse de Choiseul, who, was warmly interested in this affair, one day\r\nentreated the Queen, in my presence, at least to condescend to ask the\r\nfirst president when the cause would be called on; the Queen replied that\r\nshe could not even do that, for it would manifest an interest which it was\r\nher duty not to show.\r\n\r\nIf the King had not inspired the Queen with a lively feeling of love, it\r\nis quite certain that she yielded him respect and affection for the\r\ngoodness of his disposition and the equity of which he gave so many proofs\r\nthroughout his reign.  One evening she returned very late; she came out of\r\nthe King’s closet, and said to M. de Misery and myself, drying her eyes,\r\nwhich were filled with tears, “You see me weeping, but do not be uneasy at\r\nit: these are the sweetest tears that a wife can shed; they are caused by\r\nthe impression which the justice and goodness of the King have made upon\r\nme; he has just complied with my request for a revision of the proceedings\r\nagainst Messieurs de Bellegarde and de Monthieu, victims of the Duc\r\nd’Aiguillon’s hatred to the Duc de Choiseul. He has been equally just to\r\nthe Duc de Guines in his affair with Tort. It is a happy thing for a queen\r\nto be able to admire and esteem him who has admitted her to a\r\nparticipation of his throne; and as to you, I congratulate you upon your\r\nhaving to live under the sceptre of so virtuous a sovereign.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen laid before the King all the memorials of the Duc de Guines,\r\nwho, during his embassy to England, was involved in difficulties by a\r\nsecretary, who speculated in the public funds in London on his own\r\naccount, but in such a manner as to throw a suspicion of it on the\r\nambassador.  Messieurs de Vergennes and Turgot, bearing but little\r\ngood-will to the Duc de Guines, who was the friend of the Duc de Choiseul,\r\nwere not disposed to render the ambassador any service.  The Queen\r\nsucceeded in fixing the King’s particular attention on this affair, and\r\nthe innocence of the Duc de Guines triumphed through the equity of Louis\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nAn incessant underhand war was carried on between the friends and\r\npartisans of M. de Choiseul, who were called the Austrians, and those who\r\nsided with Messieurs d’Aiguillon, de Maurepas, and de Vergennes, who, for\r\nthe same reason, kept up the intrigues carried on at Court and in Paris\r\nagainst the Queen.  Marie Antoinette, on her part, supported those who had\r\nsuffered in this political quarrel, and it was this feeling which led her\r\nto ask for a revision of the proceedings against Messieurs de Bellegarde\r\nand de Monthieu.  The first, a colonel and inspector of artillery, and the\r\nsecond, proprietor of a foundry at St. Etienne, were, under the Ministry\r\nof the Duc d’Aiguillon, condemned to imprisonment for twenty years and a\r\nday for having withdrawn from the arsenals of France, by order of the Duc\r\nde Choiseul, a vast number of muskets, as being of no value except as old\r\niron, while in point of fact the greater part of those muskets were\r\nimmediately embarked and sold to the Americans.  It appears that the Duc\r\nde Choiseul imparted to the Queen, as grounds of defence for the accused,\r\nthe political views which led him to authorise that reduction and sale in\r\nthe manner in which it had been executed.  It rendered the case of\r\nMessieurs de Bellegarde and de Monthieu more unfavourable that the\r\nartillery officer who made the reduction in the capacity of inspector was,\r\nthrough a clandestine marriage, brother-in-law of the owner of the\r\nfoundry, the purchaser of the rejected arms.  The innocence of the two\r\nprisoners was, nevertheless, made apparent; and they came to Versailles\r\nwith their wives and children to throw themselves at the feet of their\r\nbenefactress.  This affecting scene took place in the grand gallery, at\r\nthe entrance to the Queen’s apartment.  She wished to restrain the women\r\nfrom kneeling, saying that they had only had justice done them; and that\r\nshe ought to be congratulated upon the most substantial happiness\r\nattendant upon her station, that of laying just appeals before the King.\r\n\r\nOn every occasion, when the Queen had to speak in public, she used the\r\nmost appropriate and elegant language, notwithstanding the difficulty a\r\nforeigner might be expected to experience.  She answered all addresses\r\nherself, a custom which she learned at the Court of Maria Theresa.  The\r\nPrincesses of the House of Bourbon had long ceased to take the trouble of\r\nspeaking in such cases.  Madame Addlaide blamed the Queen for not doing as\r\nthey did, assuring her that it was quite sufficient to mutter a few words\r\nthat might sound like an answer, while the addressers, occupied with what\r\nthey had themselves been saying, would always take it for granted that a\r\nproper answer had been returned.  The Queen saw that idleness alone\r\ndictated such a proceeding, and that as the practice even of muttering a\r\nfew words showed the necessity of answering in some way, it must be more\r\nproper to reply simply but clearly, and in the best style possible.\r\nSometimes indeed, when apprised of the subject of the address, she would\r\nwrite down her answer in the morning, not to learn it by heart, but in\r\norder to settle the ideas or sentiments she wished to introduce.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Comtesse de Polignac increased daily; and her friends\r\navailed themselves of it to effect changes in the Ministry. The dismissal\r\nof M. de Montbarrey, a man without talents or character, was generally\r\napproved of.  It was rightly attributed to the Queen.  He had been placed\r\nin administration by M. de Maurepas, and maintained by his aged wife;\r\nboth, of course, became more inveterate than ever against the Queen and\r\nthe Polignac circle.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of M. de Segur to the place of Minister of War, and of M.\r\nde Castries to that of Minister of Marine, were wholly the work of that\r\ncircle.  The Queen dreaded making ministers; her favourite often wept when\r\nthe men of her circle compelled her to interfere.  Men blame women for\r\nmeddling in business, and yet in courts it is continually the men\r\nthemselves who make use of the influence of the women in matters with\r\nwhich the latter ought to have nothing to do.\r\n\r\nWhen M. de Segur was presented to the Queen on his new appointment, she\r\nsaid to me, “You have just seen a minister of my making.  I am very glad,\r\nso far as regards the King’s service, that he is appointed, for I think\r\nthe selection a very good one; but I almost regret the part I have taken\r\nin it.  I take a responsibility upon myself.  I was fortunate in being\r\nfree from any; and in order to relieve myself from this as much as\r\npossible I have just promised M. de Segur, and that upon my word of\r\nhonour, not to back any petition, nor to hinder any of his operations by\r\nsolicitations on behalf of my proteges.”\r\n\r\nDuring the first administration of M. Necker, whose ambition had not then\r\ndrawn him into schemes repugnant to his better judgment, and whose views\r\nappeared to the Queen to be very judicious, she indulged in hopes of the\r\nrestoration of the finances.  Knowing that M. de Maurepas wished to drive\r\nM. Necker to resign, she urged him to have patience until the death of an\r\nold man whom the King kept about him from a fondness for his first choice,\r\nand out of respect for his advanced age.  She even went so far as to tell\r\nhim that M. de Maurepas was always ill, and that his end could not be very\r\ndistant.  M. Necker would not wait for that event.  The Queen’s prediction\r\nwas fulfilled.  M. de Maurepas ended his days immediately after a journey\r\nto Fontainebleau in 1781.\r\n\r\nM. Necker had retired.  He had been exasperated by a piece of treachery in\r\nthe old minister, for which he could not forgive him.  I knew something of\r\nthis intrigue at the time; it has since been fully explained to me by\r\nMadame la Marechale de Beauvau.  M. Necker saw that his credit at Court\r\nwas declining, and fearing lest that circumstance should injure his\r\nfinancial operations, he requested the King to grant him some favour which\r\nmight show the public that he had not lost the confidence of his\r\nsovereign.  He concluded his letter by pointing out five requests--such an\r\noffice, or such a mark of distinction, or such a badge of honour, and so\r\non, and handed it to M. de Maurepas.  The or’s were changed into and’s;\r\nand the King was displeased at M. Necker’s ambition, and the assurance\r\nwith which he displayed it.  Madame la Marechale de Beauvau assured me\r\nthat the Marechal de Castries saw the minute of M. Necker’s letter, and\r\nthat he likewise saw the altered copy.\r\n\r\nThe interest which the Queen took in M. Necker died away during his\r\nretirement, and at last changed into strong prejudice against him.  He\r\nwrote too much about the measures he would have pursued, and the benefits\r\nthat would have resulted to the State from them.  The ministers who\r\nsucceeded him thought their operations embarrassed by the care that M.\r\nNecker and his partisans incessantly took to occupy the public with his\r\nplans; his friends were too ardent.  The Queen discerned a party spirit in\r\nthese combinations, and sided wholly with his enemies.\r\n\r\nAfter those inefficient comptrollers-general, Messieurs Joly de Fleury and\r\nd’Ormesson, it became necessary to resort to a man of more acknowledged\r\ntalent, and the Queen’s friends, at that time combining with the Comte\r\nd’Artois and with M. de Vergennes, got M. de Calonne appointed. The Queen\r\nwas highly displeased, and her close intimacy with the Duchesse de\r\nPolignac began to suffer for this.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty, continuing to converse with me upon the difficulties she had\r\nmet with in private life, told me that ambitious men without merit\r\nsometimes found means to gain their ends by dint of importunity, and that\r\nshe had to blame herself for having procured M. d’Adhemar’s appointment to\r\nthe London embassy, merely because he teased her into it at the Duchess’s\r\nhouse.  She added, however, that it was at a time of perfect peace with\r\nthe English; that the Ministry knew the inefficiency of M. d’Adhemar as\r\nwell as she did, and that he could do neither harm nor good.\r\n\r\nOften in conversations of unreserved frankness the Queen owned that she\r\nhad purchased rather dearly a piece of experience which would make her\r\ncarefully watch over the conduct of her daughters-in-law, and that she\r\nwould be particularly scrupulous about the qualifications of the ladies\r\nwho might attend them; that no consideration of rank or favour should bias\r\nher in so important a choice.  She attributed several of her youthful\r\nmistakes to a lady of great levity, whom she found in her palace on her\r\narrival in France.  She also determined to forbid the Princesses coming\r\nunder her control the practice of singing with professors, and said,\r\ncandidly, and with as much severity as her slanderers could have done, “I\r\nought to have heard Garat sing, and never to have sung duets with him.”\r\n\r\nThe indiscreet zeal of Monsieur Augeard contributed to the public belief\r\nthat the Queen disposed of all the offices of finance.  He had, without\r\nany authority for doing so, required the committee of fermiers-general to\r\ninform him of all vacancies, assuring them that they would be meeting the\r\nwishes of the Queen.  The members complied, but not without murmuring.\r\nWhen the Queen became aware of what her secretary had done, she highly\r\ndisapproved of it, caused her resentment to be made known to the\r\nfermiers-general, and abstained from asking for appointments,--making only\r\none request of the kind, as a marriage portion for one of her attendants,\r\na young woman of good family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Queen did not sufficiently conceal the dissatisfaction she felt at\r\nhaving been unable to prevent the appointment of M. de Calonne; she even\r\none day went so far as to say at the Duchess’s, in the midst of the\r\npartisans and protectors of that minister, that the finances of France\r\npassed alternately from the hands of an honest man without talent into\r\nthose of a skilful knave.  M. de Calonne was thus far from acting in\r\nconcert with the Queen all the time that he continued in office; and,\r\nwhile dull verses were circulated about Paris describing the Queen and her\r\nfavourite dipping at pleasure into the coffers of the comptroller-general,\r\nthe Queen was avoiding all communication with him.\r\n\r\nDuring the long and severe winter of 1783-84 the King gave three millions\r\nof livres for the relief of the indigent.  M. de Calonne, who felt the\r\nnecessity of making advances to the Queen, caught at this opportunity of\r\nshowing her respect and devotion.  He offered to place in her hands one\r\nmillion of the three, to be distributed in her name and under her\r\ndirection.  His proposal was rejected; the Queen answered that the charity\r\nought to be wholly distributed in the King’s name, and that she would this\r\nyear debar herself of even the slightest enjoyments, in order to\r\ncontribute all her savings to the relief of the unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThe moment M. de Calonne left the closet the Queen sent for me:\r\n“Congratulate me, my dear,” said she; “I have just escaped a snare, or at\r\nleast a matter which eventually might have caused me much regret.” She\r\nrelated the conversation which had taken place word for word to me,\r\nadding, “That man will complete the ruin of the national finances.  It is\r\nsaid that I placed him in his situation.  The people are made to believe\r\nthat I am extravagant; yet I have refused to suffer a sum of money from\r\nthe royal treasury, although destined for the most laudable purpose, even\r\nto pass through my hands.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen, making monthly retrenchments from the expenditure of her privy\r\npurse, and not having spent the gifts customary at the period of her\r\nconfinement, was in possession of from five to six hundred thousand\r\nfrancs, her own savings.  She made use of from two to three hundred\r\nthousand francs of this, which her first women sent to M. Lenoir, to the\r\ncures of Paris and Versailles, and to the Soeurs Hospitalieres, and so\r\ndistributed them among families in need.\r\n\r\nDesirous to implant in the breast of her daughter not only a desire to\r\nsuccour the unfortunate, but those qualities necessary for the due\r\ndischarge of that duty, the Queen incessantly talked to her, though she\r\nwas yet very young, about the sufferings of the poor during a season so\r\ninclement.  The Princess already had a sum of from eight to ten thousand\r\nfrancs for charitable purposes, and the Queen made her distribute part of\r\nit herself.\r\n\r\nWishing to give her children yet another lesson of beneficence, she\r\ndesired me on New Year’s eve to get from Paris, as in other years, all the\r\nfashionable playthings, and have them spread out in her closet. Then\r\ntaking her children by the hand, she showed them all the dolls and\r\nmechanical toys which were ranged there, and told them that she had\r\nintended to give them some handsome New Year’s gifts, but that the cold\r\nmade the poor so wretched that all her money was spent in blankets and\r\nclothes to protect them from the rigour of the season, and in supplying\r\nthem with bread; so that this year they would only have the pleasure of\r\nlooking at the new playthings.  When she returned with her children into\r\nher sitting-room, she said there was still an unavoidable expense to be\r\nincurred; that assuredly many mothers would at that season think as she\r\ndid,--that the toyman must lose by it; and therefore she gave him fifty\r\nLouis to repay him for the cost of his journey, and console him for having\r\nsold nothing.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of St. Cloud, a matter very simple in itself, had, on account\r\nof the prevailing spirit, unfavourable consequences to the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe palace of Versailles, pulled to pieces in the interior by a variety of\r\nnew arrangements, and mutilated in point of uniformity by the removal of\r\nthe ambassadors’ staircase, and of the peristyle of columns placed at the\r\nend of the marble court, was equally in want of substantial and ornamental\r\nrepair.  The King therefore desired M. Micque to lay before him several\r\nplans for the repairs of the palace.  He consulted me on certain\r\narrangements analogous to some of those adopted in the Queen’s\r\nestablishment, and in my presence asked M. Micque how much money would be\r\nwanted for the execution of the whole work, and how many years he would be\r\nin completing it.  I forget how many millions were mentioned: M. Micque\r\nreplied that six years would be sufficient time if the Treasury made the\r\nnecessary periodical advances without any delay.  “And how many years\r\nshall you require,” said the King, “if the advances are not punctually\r\nmade?”--“Ten, Sire,” replied the architect.  “We must then reckon upon ten\r\nyears,” said his Majesty, “and put off this great undertaking until the\r\nyear 1790; it will occupy the rest of the century.”\r\n\r\nThe King afterwards talked of the depreciation of property which took\r\nplace at Versailles whilst the Regent removed the Court of Louis XV. to\r\nthe Tuileries, and said that he must consider how to prevent that\r\ninconvenience; it was the desire to do this that promoted the purchase of\r\nSt. Cloud.  The Queen first thought of it one day when she was riding out\r\nwith the Duchesse de Polignac and the Comtesse Diane; she mentioned it to\r\nthe King, who was much pleased with the thought,--the purchase confirming\r\nhim in the intention, which he had entertained for ten years, of quitting\r\nVersailles.\r\n\r\nThe King determined that the ministers, public officers, pages, and a\r\nconsiderable part of his stabling should remain at Versailles.  Messieurs\r\nde Breteuil and de Calonne were instructed to treat with the Duc d’Orleans\r\nfor the purchase of St. Cloud; at first they hoped to be able to conclude\r\nthe business by a mere exchange.  The value of the Chateau de Choisy, de\r\nla Muette, and a forest was equivalent to the sum demanded by the House of\r\nOrleans; and in the exchange which the Queen expected she only saw a\r\nsaving to be made instead of an increase of expense.  By this arrangement\r\nthe government of Choisy, in the hands of the Duc de Coigny, and that of\r\nLa Muette, in the hands of the Marechal de Soubise, would be suppressed.\r\nAt the same time the two concierges, and all the servants employed in\r\nthese two royal houses, would be reduced; but while the treaty was going\r\nforward Messieurs de Breteuil and de Calonne gave up the point of\r\nexchange, and some millions in cash were substituted for Choisy and La\r\nMuette.\r\n\r\nThe Queen advised the King to give her St. Cloud, as a means of avoiding\r\nthe establishment of a governor; her plan being to have merely a concierge\r\nthere, by which means the governor’s expenses would be saved. The King\r\nagreed, and St. Cloud was purchased for the Queen.  She provided the same\r\nliveries for the porters at the gates and servants at the chateau as for\r\nthose at Trianon.  The concierge at the latter place had put up some\r\nregulations for the household, headed, “By order of the Queen.”  The same\r\nthing was done at St. Cloud.  The Queen’s livery at the door of a palace\r\nwhere it was expected none but that of the King would be seen, and the\r\nwords “By order of the Queen” at the head of the printed papers pasted\r\nnear the iron gates, caused a great sensation, and produced a very\r\nunfortunate effect, not only among the common people, but also among\r\npersons of a superior class.  They saw in it an attack upon the customs of\r\nmonarchy, and customs are nearly equal to laws.  The Queen heard of this,\r\nbut she thought that her dignity would be compromised if she made any\r\nchange in the form of these regulations, though they might have been\r\naltogether superseded without inconvenience.  “My name is not out of\r\nplace,” said she, “in gardens belonging to myself; I may give orders there\r\nwithout infringing on the rights of the State.”  This was her only answer\r\nto the representations which a few faithful servants ventured to make on\r\nthe subject.  The discontent of the Parisians on this occasion probably\r\ninduced M. d’Espremenil, upon the first troubles about the Parliament, to\r\nsay that it was impolitic and immoral to see palaces belonging to a Queen\r\nof France.\r\n\r\n[The Queen never forgot this affront of M. d’Espremenil’s; she said that\r\nas it was offered at a time when social order had not yet been disturbed,\r\nshe had felt the severest mortification at it.  Shortly before the\r\ndownfall of the throne M. Espremenil, having openly espoused the King’s\r\nside, was insulted in the gardens of the Tuileries by the Jacobins, and so\r\nill-treated that he was carried home very ill.  Somebody recommended the\r\nQueen, on account of the royalist principles he then professed, to send\r\nand inquire for him. She replied that she was truly grieved at what had\r\nhappened to M. d’Espremenil, but that mere policy should never induce her\r\nto show any particular solicitude about the man who had been the first to\r\nmake so insulting an attack upon her character.--MADAME CAMPAN]\r\n\r\nThe Queen was very much dissatisfied with the manner in which M. de\r\nCalonne had managed this matter.  The Abbe de Vermond, the most active and\r\npersevering of that minister’s enemies, saw with delight that the\r\nexpedients of those from whom alone new resources might be expected were\r\ngradually becoming exhausted, because the period when the Archbishop of\r\nToulouse would be placed over the finances was thereby hastened.\r\n\r\nThe royal navy had resumed an imposing attitude during the war for the\r\nindependence of America; glorious peace with England had compensated for\r\nthe former attacks of our enemies upon the fame of France; and the throne\r\nwas surrounded by numerous heirs.  The sole ground of uneasiness was in\r\nthe finances, but that uneasiness related only to the manner in which they\r\nwere administered.  In a word, France felt confident in its own strength\r\nand resources, when two events, which seem scarcely worthy of a place in\r\nhistory, but which have, nevertheless, an important one in that of the\r\nFrench Revolution, introduced a spirit of ridicule and contempt, not only\r\nagainst the highest ranks, but even against the most august personages.  I\r\nallude to a comedy and a great swindling transaction.\r\n\r\nBeaumarchais had long possessed a reputation in certain circles in Paris\r\nfor his wit and musical talents, and at the theatres for dramas more or\r\nless indifferent, when his “Barbier de Seville” procured him a higher\r\nposition among dramatic writers.  His “Memoirs” against M. Goesman had\r\namused Paris by the ridicule they threw upon a Parliament which was\r\ndisliked; and his admission to an intimacy with M. de Maurepas procured\r\nhim a degree of influence over important affairs.  He then became\r\nambitious of influencing public opinion by a kind of drama, in which\r\nestablished manners and customs should be held up to popular derision and\r\nthe ridicule of the new philosophers.  After several years of prosperity\r\nthe minds of the French had become more generally critical; and when\r\nBeaumarchais had finished his monstrous but diverting “Mariage de Figaro,”\r\n all people of any consequence were eager for the gratification of hearing\r\nit read, the censors having decided that it should not be performed.\r\nThese readings of “Figaro” grew so numerous that people were daily heard\r\nto say, “I have been (or I am going to be) at the reading of\r\nBeaumarchais’s play.”  The desire to see it performed became universal; an\r\nexpression that he had the art to use compelled, as it were, the\r\napprobation of the nobility, or of persons in power, who aimed at ranking\r\namong the magnanimous; he made his “Figaro” say that “none but little\r\nminds dreaded little books.”  The Baron de Breteuil, and all the men of\r\nMadame de Polignac’s circle, entered the lists as the warmest protectors\r\nof the comedy.  Solicitations to the King became so pressing that his\r\nMajesty determined to judge for himself of a work which so much engrossed\r\npublic attention, and desired me to ask M. Le Noir, lieutenant of police,\r\nfor the manuscript of the “Mariage de Figaro.”  One morning I received a\r\nnote from the Queen ordering me to be with her at three o’clock, and not\r\nto come without having dined, for she should detain me some time.  When I\r\ngot to the Queen’s inner closet I found her alone with the King; a chair\r\nand a small table were ready placed opposite to them, and upon the table\r\nlay an enormous manuscript in several books.  The King said to me, “There\r\nis Beaumarchais’s comedy; you must read it to us.  You will find several\r\nparts troublesome on account of the erasures and references.  I have\r\nalready run it over, but I wish the Queen to be acquainted with the work.\r\nYou will not mention this reading to any one.”\r\n\r\nI began.  The King frequently interrupted me by praise or censure, which\r\nwas always just.  He frequently exclaimed, “That’s in bad taste; this man\r\ncontinually brings the Italian concetti on the stage.”  At that soliloquy\r\nof Figaro in which he attacks various points of government, and especially\r\nat the tirade against State prisons, the King rose up and said,\r\nindignantly:\r\n\r\n“That’s detestable; that shall never be played; the Bastille must be\r\ndestroyed before the license to act this play can be any other than an act\r\nof the most dangerous inconsistency.  This man scoffs at everything that\r\nshould be respected in a government.”\r\n\r\n“It will not be played, then?”  said the Queen.\r\n\r\n“No, certainly,” replied Louis XVI.; “you may rely upon that.”\r\n\r\nStill it was constantly reported that “Figaro” was about to be performed;\r\nthere were even wagers laid upon the subject; I never should have laid any\r\nmyself, fancying that I was better informed as to the probability than\r\nanybody else; if I had, however, I should have been completely deceived.\r\nThe protectors of Beaumarchais, feeling certain that they would succeed in\r\ntheir scheme of making his work public in spite of the King’s prohibition,\r\ndistributed the parts in the “Mariage de Figaro” among the actors of the\r\nTheatre Francais.  Beaumarchais had made them enter into the spirit of his\r\ncharacters, and they determined to enjoy at least one performance of this\r\nso-called chef d’oeuvre.  The first gentlemen of the chamber agreed that\r\nM. de la Ferte should lend the theatre of the Hotel des Menus Plaisirs, at\r\nParis, which was used for rehearsals of the opera; tickets were\r\ndistributed to a vast number of leaders of society, and the day for the\r\nperformance was fixed.  The King heard of all this only on the very\r\nmorning, and signed a ‘lettre de cachet,’--[A ‘lettre de cachet’ was any\r\nwritten order proceeding from the King.  The term was not confined merely\r\nto orders for arrest.]--which prohibited the performance.  When the\r\nmessenger who brought the order arrived, he found a part of the theatre\r\nalready filled with spectators, and the streets leading to the Hotel des\r\nMenus Plaisirs filled with carriages; the piece was not performed.  This\r\nprohibition of the King’s was looked upon as an attack on public liberty.\r\n\r\nThe disappointment produced such discontent that the words oppression and\r\ntyranny were uttered with no less passion and bitterness at that time than\r\nduring the days which immediately preceded the downfall of the throne.\r\nBeaumarchais was so far put off his guard by rage as to exclaim, “Well,\r\ngentlemen, he won’t suffer it to be played here; but I swear it shall be\r\nplayed,--perhaps in the very choir of Notre-Dame!”  There was something\r\nprophetic in these words.  It was generally insinuated shortly afterwards\r\nthat Beaumarchais had determined to suppress all those parts of his work\r\nwhich could be obnoxious to the Government; and on pretence of judging of\r\nthe sacrifices made by the author, M. de Vaudreuil obtained permission to\r\nhave this far-famed “Mariage de Figaro” performed at his country house.\r\nM. Campan was asked there; he had frequently heard the work read, and did\r\nnot now find the alterations that had been announced; this he observed to\r\nseveral persons belonging to the Court, who maintained that the author had\r\nmade all the sacrifices required.  M. Campan was so astonished at these\r\npersistent assertions of an obvious falsehood that he replied by a\r\nquotation from Beaumarchais himself, and assuming the tone of Basilio in\r\nthe “Barbier de Seville,” he said, “Faith, gentlemen, I don’t know who is\r\ndeceived here; everybody is in the secret.”  They then came to the point,\r\nand begged him to tell the Queen positively that all which had been\r\npronounced reprehensible in M. de Beaumarchais’s play had been cut out.\r\nMy father-in-law contented himself with replying that his situation at\r\nCourt would not allow of his giving an opinion unless the Queen should\r\nfirst speak of the piece to him. The Queen said nothing to him about the\r\nmatter.  Shortly, afterwards permission to perform this play was at length\r\nobtained.  The Queen thought the people of Paris would be finely tricked\r\nwhen they saw merely an ill-conceived piece, devoid of interest, as it\r\nmust appear when deprived of its Satire.\r\n\r\n[“The King,” says Grimm, “made sure that the public would judge\r\nunfavourably of the work.”  He said to the Marquis de Montesquiou, who was\r\ngoing to see the first representation, ‘Well, what do you augur of its\r\nsuccess?’--‘Sire, I hope the piece will fail.’--‘And so do I,’ replied the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n“There is something still more ridiculous than my piece,” said\r\nBeaumarchais himself; “that is, its success.”  Mademoiselle Arnould\r\nforesaw it the first day, and exclaimed, “It is a production that will\r\nfail fifty nights successively.”  There was as crowded an audience on the\r\nseventy-second night as on the first.  The following is extracted from\r\nGrimm’s ‘Correspondence.’\r\n\r\n“Answer of M. de Beaumarchais to -----, who requested the use of his\r\nprivate box for some ladies desirous of seeing ‘Figaro’ without being\r\nthemselves seen.\r\n\r\n“I have no respect for women who indulge themselves in seeing any play\r\nwhich they think indecorous, provided they can do so in secret. I lend\r\nmyself to no such acts.  I have given my piece to the public, to amuse,\r\nand not to instruct, not to give any compounding prudes the pleasure of\r\ngoing to admire it in a private box, and balancing their account with\r\nconscience by censuring it in company.  To indulge in the pleasure of vice\r\nand assume the credit of virtue is the hypocrisy of the age.  My piece is\r\nnot of a doubtful nature; it must be patronised in good earnest, or\r\navoided altogether; therefore, with all respect to you, I shall keep my\r\nbox.”  This letter was circulated all over Paris for a week.]\r\n\r\nUnder the persuasion that there was not a passage left capable of\r\nmalicious or dangerous application, Monsieur attended the first\r\nperformance in a public box.  The mad enthusiasm of the public in favour\r\nof the piece and Monsieur’s just displeasure are well known.  The author\r\nwas sent to prison soon afterwards, though his work was extolled to the\r\nskies, and though the Court durst not suspend its performance.\r\n\r\nThe Queen testified her displeasure against all who had assisted the\r\nauthor of the “Mariage de Figaro” to deceive the King into giving his\r\nconsent that it should be represented.  Her reproaches were more\r\nparticularly directed against M. de Vaudreuil for having had it performed\r\nat his house.  The violent and domineering disposition of her favourite’s\r\nfriend at last became disagreeable to her.\r\n\r\nOne evening, on the Queen’s return from the Duchess’s, she desired her\r\n‘valet de chambre’ to bring her billiard cue into her closet, and ordered\r\nme to open the box that contained it.  I took out the cue, broken in two.\r\nIt was of ivory, and formed of one single elephant’s tooth; the butt was\r\nof gold and very tastefully wrought.  “There,” said she, “that is the way\r\nM. de Vaudreuil has treated a thing I valued highly.  I had laid it upon\r\nthe couch while I was talking to the Duchess in the salon; he had the\r\nassurance to make use of it, and in a fit of passion about a blocked ball,\r\nhe struck the cue so violently against the table that he broke it in two.\r\nThe noise brought me back into the billiard-room; I did not say a word to\r\nhim, but my looks showed him how angry I was.  He is the more provoked at\r\nthe accident, as he aspires to the post of Governor to the Dauphin.  I\r\nnever thought of him for the place.  It is quite enough to have consulted\r\nmy heart only in the choice of a governess; and I will not suffer that of\r\na Governor to the Dauphin to be at all affected by the influence of my\r\nfriends.  I should be responsible for it to the nation. The poor man does\r\nnot know that my determination is taken; for I have never expressed it to\r\nthe Duchess.  Therefore, judge of the sort of an evening he must have\r\npassed!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after the public mind had been thrown into agitation by the\r\nperformance of the “Mariage de Figaro,” an obscure plot, contrived by\r\nswindlers, and matured in a corrupted society, attacked the Queen’s\r\ncharacter in a vital point and assailed the majesty of the throne.\r\n\r\nI am about to speak of the notorious affair of the necklace purchased, as\r\nit was said, for the Queen by Cardinal de Rohan.  I will narrate all that\r\nhas come to my knowledge relating to this business; the most minute\r\nparticulars will prove how little reason the Queen had to apprehend the\r\nblow by which she was threatened, and which must be attributed to a\r\nfatality that human prudence could not have foreseen, but from which, to\r\nsay the truth, she might have extricated herself with more skill.\r\n\r\nI have already said that in 1774 the Queen purchased jewels of Boehmer to\r\nthe value of three hundred and sixty thousand franca, that she paid for\r\nthem herself out of her own private funds, and that it required several\r\nyears to enable her to complete the payment.  The King afterwards\r\npresented her with a set of rubies and diamonds of a fine water, and\r\nsubsequently with a pair of bracelets worth two hundred thousand francs.\r\nThe Queen, after having her diamonds reset in new patterns, told Boehmer\r\nthat she found her jewel case rich enough, and was not desirous of making\r\nany addition to it.\r\n\r\n[Except on those days when the assemblies at Court were particularly\r\nattended, such as the 1st of January and the 2d of February, devoted to\r\nthe procession of the Order of the Holy Ghost, and on the festivals of\r\nEaster, Whitsuntide, and Christmas, the Queen no longer wore any dresses\r\nbut muslin or white Florentine taffety.  Her head-dress was merely a hat;\r\nthe plainest were preferred; and her diamonds never quitted their caskets\r\nbut for the dresses of ceremony, confined to the days I have mentioned.\r\nBefore the Queen was five and twenty she began to apprehend that she might\r\nbe induced to make too frequent use of flowers and of ornaments, which at\r\nthat time were exclusively reserved for youth.  Madame Bertin having\r\nbrought a wreath for the head and neck, composed of roses, the Queen\r\nfeared that the brightness of the flowers might be disadvantageous to her\r\ncomplexion.  She was unquestionably too severe upon herself, her beauty\r\nhaving as yet experienced no alteration; it is easy to conceive the\r\nconcert of praise and compliment that replied to the doubt she had\r\nexpressed.  The Queen, approaching me, said, “I charge you, from this day,\r\nto give me notice when flowers shall cease to become me.”--“I shall do no\r\nsuch thing,” I replied, immediately; “I have not read ‘Gil Bias’ without\r\nprofiting in some degree from it, and I find your Majesty’s order too much\r\nlike that given him by the Archbishop of Granada, to warn him of the\r\nmoment when he should begin to fall off in the composition of his\r\nhomilies.”--“Go,” said the Queen; “You are less sincere than Gil Blas; and\r\nI world have been more amenable than the Archbishop.”--MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nStill, this jeweller busied himself for some years in forming a collection\r\nof the finest diamonds circulating in the trade, in order to compose a\r\nnecklace of several rows, which he hoped to induce her Majesty to\r\npurchase; he brought it to M. Campan, requesting him to mention it to the\r\nQueen, that she might ask to see it, and thus be induced to wish to\r\npossess it.  This M. Campan refused to do, telling him that he should be\r\nstepping out of the line of his duty were he to propose to the Queen an\r\nexpense of sixteen hundred thousand francs, and that he believed neither\r\nthe lady of honour nor the tirewoman would take upon herself to execute\r\nsuch a commission.  Boehmer persuaded the King’s first gentleman for the\r\nyear to show this superb necklace to his Majesty, who admired it so much\r\nthat he himself wished to see the Queen adorned with it, and sent the case\r\nto her; but she assured him she should much regret incurring so great an\r\nexpense for such an article, that she had already very beautiful diamonds,\r\nthat jewels of that description were now worn at Court not more than four\r\nor five times a year, that the necklace must be returned, and that the\r\nmoney would be much better employed in building a man-of-war.\r\n\r\n[Messieurs Boehmer and Bassange, jewellers to the Crown, were proprietors\r\nof a superb diamond necklace, which had, as it was said, been intended for\r\nthe Comtesse du Barry.  Being under the necessity of selling it, they\r\noffered it, during the last war, to the king and Queen; but their\r\nMajesties made the following prudent answer: “We stand more in need of\r\nships than of jewels.”--“Secret Correspondence of the Court of Louis\r\nXVI.”]\r\n\r\nBoehmer, in sad tribulation at finding his expectations delusive,\r\nendeavoured for some time, it is said, to dispose of his necklace among\r\nthe various Courts of Europe.\r\n\r\nA year after his fruitless attempts, Boehmer again caused his diamond\r\nnecklace to be offered to the King, proposing that it should be paid for\r\npartly by instalments, and partly in life annuities; this proposal was\r\nrepresented as highly advantageous, and the King, in my presence,\r\nmentioned the matter once more to the Queen.  I remember the Queen told\r\nhim that, if the bargain really was not bad, he might make it, and keep\r\nthe necklace until the marriage of one of his children; but that, for her\r\npart, she would never wear it, being unwilling that the world should have\r\nto reproach her with having coveted so expensive an article.  The King\r\nreplied that their children were too young to justify such an expense,\r\nwhich would be greatly increased by the number of years the diamonds would\r\nremain useless, and that he would finally decline the offer. Boehmer\r\ncomplained to everybody of his misfortune, and all reasonable people\r\nblamed him for having collected diamonds to so considerable an amount\r\nwithout any positive order for them.  This man had purchased the office of\r\njeweller to the Crown, which gave him some rights of entry at Court.\r\nAfter several months spent in ineffectual attempts to carry his point, and\r\nin idle complaints, he obtained an audience of the Queen, who had with her\r\nthe young Princess, her daughter; her Majesty did not know for what\r\npurpose Boehmer sought this audience, and had not the slightest idea that\r\nit was to speak to her again about an article twice refused by herself and\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\nBoehmer threw himself upon his knees, clasped his hands, burst into tears,\r\nand exclaimed, “Madame, I am ruined and disgraced if you do not purchase\r\nmy necklace.  I cannot outlive so many misfortunes.  When I go hence I\r\nshall throw myself into the river.”\r\n\r\n“Rise, Boehmer,” said the Queen, in a tone sufficiently severe to recall\r\nhim to himself; “I do not like these rhapsodies; honest men have no\r\noccasion to fall on their knees to make their requests.  If you were to\r\ndestroy yourself I should regret you as a madman in whom I had taken an\r\ninterest, but I should not be in any way responsible for that misfortune.\r\nNot only have I never ordered the article which causes your present\r\ndespair, but whenever you have talked to me about fine collections of\r\njewels I have told you that I should not add four diamonds to those which\r\nI already possessed.  I told you myself that I declined taking the\r\nnecklace; the King wished to give it to me, but I refused him also; never\r\nmention it to me again.  Divide it and try to sell it piecemeal, and do\r\nnot drown yourself.  I am very angry with you for acting this scene of\r\ndespair in my presence and before this child.  Let me never see you behave\r\nthus again.  Go.”  Baehmer withdrew, overwhelmed with confusion, and\r\nnothing further was then heard of him.\r\n\r\nWhen Madame Sophie was born the Queen told me M. de Saint-James, a rich\r\nfinancier, had apprised her that Boehmer was still intent upon the sale of\r\nhis necklace, and that she ought, for her own satisfaction, to endeavour\r\nto learn what the man had done with it; she desired me the first time I\r\nshould meet him to speak to him about it, as if from the interest I took\r\nin his welfare.  I spoke to him about his necklace, and he told me he had\r\nbeen very fortunate, having sold it at Constantinople for the favourite\r\nsultana.  I communicated this answer to the Queen, who was delighted with\r\nit, but could not comprehend how the Sultan came to purchase his diamonds\r\nin Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Queen long avoided seeing Boehmer, being fearful of his rash\r\ncharacter; and her valet de chambre, who had the care of her jewels, made\r\nthe necessary repairs to her ornaments unassisted.  On the baptism of the\r\nDuc d’Angouleme, in 1785, the King gave him a diamond epaulet and buckles,\r\nand directed Baehmer to deliver them to the Queen.  Boehmer presented them\r\non her return from mass, and at the same time gave into her hands a letter\r\nin the form of a petition.  In this paper he told the Queen that he was\r\nhappy to see her “in possession of the finest diamonds known in Europe,”\r\n and entreated her not to forget him.  The Queen read Boehmer’s address to\r\nher aloud, and saw nothing in it but a proof of mental aberration; she\r\nlighted the paper at a wax taper standing near her, as she had some\r\nletters to seal, saying, “It is not worth keeping.” She afterwards much\r\nregretted the loss of this enigmatical memorial. After having burnt the\r\npaper, her Majesty said to me, “That man is born to be my torment; he has\r\nalways some mad scheme in his head; remember, the first time you see him,\r\nto tell him that I do not like diamonds now, and that I will buy no more\r\nso long as I live; that if I had any money to spare I would rather add to\r\nmy property at St. Cloud by the purchase of the land surrounding it; now,\r\nmind you enter into all these particulars and impress them well upon him.”\r\n I asked her whether she wished me to send for him; she replied in the\r\nnegative, adding that it would be sufficient to avail myself of the first\r\nopportunity afforded by meeting him; and that the slightest advance\r\ntowards such a man would be misplaced.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of August I left Versailles for my country house at Crespy; on\r\nthe 3d came Boehmer, extremely uneasy at not having received any answer\r\nfrom the Queen, to ask me whether I had any commission from her to him; I\r\nreplied that she had entrusted me with none; that she had no commands for\r\nhim, and I faithfully repeated all she had desired me to say to him.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Boehmer, “the answer to the letter I presented to her,--to\r\nwhom must I apply for that?”\r\n\r\n“To nobody,” answered I; “her Majesty burnt your memorial without even\r\ncomprehending its meaning.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! madame,” exclaimed he, “that is impossible; the Queen knows that she\r\nhas money to pay me!”\r\n\r\n“Money, M. Boehmer?  Your last accounts against the Queen were discharged\r\nlong ago.”\r\n\r\n“Madame, you are not in the secret.  A man who is ruined for want of\r\npayment of fifteen hundred thousand francs cannot be said to be\r\nsatisfied.”\r\n\r\n“Have you lost your senses?” said I.  “For what can the Queen owe you so\r\nextravagant a sum?”\r\n\r\n“For my necklace, madame,” replied Boehmer, coolly.\r\n\r\n“What!” I exclaimed, “that necklace again, which you have teased the Queen\r\nabout so many years!  Did you not tell me you had sold it at\r\nConstantinople?”\r\n\r\n“The Queen desired me to give that answer to all who should speak to me on\r\nthe subject,” said the wretched dupe.  He then told me that the Queen\r\nwished to have the necklace, and had had it purchased for her by\r\nMonseigneur, the Cardinal de Rohan.\r\n\r\n“You are deceived,” I exclaimed; “the Queen has not once spoken to the\r\nCardinal since his return from Vienna; there is not a man at her Court\r\nless favourably looked upon.”\r\n\r\n“You are deceived yourself, madame,” said Boehmer; “she sees him so much\r\nin private that it was to his Eminence she gave thirty thousand francs,\r\nwhich were paid me as an instalment; she took them, in his presence, out\r\nof the little secretaire of Sevres porcelain next the fireplace in her\r\nboudoir.”\r\n\r\n“And the Cardinal told you all this?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame, himself.”\r\n\r\n“What a detestable plot!”  cried I.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, to say the truth, madame, I begin to be much alarmed, for his\r\nEminence assured me that the Queen would wear the necklace on Whit-Sunday,\r\nbut I did not see it upon her, and it was that which induced me to write\r\nto her Majesty.”\r\n\r\nHe then asked me what he ought to do.  I advised him to go on to\r\nVersailles, instead of returning to Paris, whence he had just arrived; to\r\nobtain an immediate audience from the Baron de Breteuil, who, as head of\r\nthe King’s household, was the minister of the department to which Boehmer\r\nbelonged, and to be circumspect; and I added that he appeared to me\r\nextremely culpable,--not as a diamond merchant, but because being a sworn\r\nofficer it was unpardonable of him to have acted without the direct orders\r\nof the King, the Queen, or the Minister.  He answered, that he had not\r\nacted without direct orders; that he had in his possession all the notes\r\nsigned by the Queen, and that he had even been obliged to show them to\r\nseveral bankers in order to induce them to extend the time for his\r\npayments.  I urged his departure for Versailles, and he assured me he\r\nwould go there immediately.  Instead of following my advice, he went to\r\nthe Cardinal, and it was of this visit of Boehmer’s that his Eminence made\r\na memorandum, found in a drawer overlooked by the Abbe Georgel when he\r\nburnt, by order of the Cardinal, all the papers which the latter had at\r\nParis.  The memorandum was thus worded: “On this day, 3d August, Boehmer\r\nwent to Madame Campan’s country house, and she told him that the Queen had\r\nnever had his necklace, and that he had been deceived.”\r\n\r\nWhen Boehmer was gone, I wanted to follow him, and go to the Queen; my\r\nfather-in-law prevented me, and ordered me to leave the minister to\r\nelucidate such an important affair, observing that it was an infernal\r\nplot; that I had given Boehmer the best advice, and had nothing more to do\r\nwith the business.  Boehmer never said one word to me about the woman De\r\nLamotte, and her name was mentioned for the first time by the Cardinal in\r\nhis answers to the interrogatories put to him before the King.  After\r\nseeing the Cardinal, Boehmer went to Trianon, and sent a message to the\r\nQueen, purporting that I had advised him to come and speak to her.  His\r\nvery words were repeated to her Majesty, who said, “He is mad; I have\r\nnothing to say to him, and will not see him.”  Two or three days\r\nafterwards the Queen sent for me to Petit Trianon, to rehearse with me the\r\npart of Rosina, which she was to perform in the “Barbier de Seville.” I\r\nwas alone with her, sitting upon her couch; no mention was made of\r\nanything but the part.  After we had spent an hour in the rehearsal, her\r\nMajesty asked me why I had sent Boehmer to her; saying he had been in my\r\nname to speak to her, and that she would not see him.  It was in this\r\nmanner I learnt that he had not followed my advice in the slightest\r\ndegree.  The change of my countenance, when I heard the man’s name, was\r\nvery perceptible; the Queen perceived it, and questioned me.  I entreated\r\nher to see him, and assured her it was of the utmost importance for her\r\npeace of mind; that there was a plot going on, of which she was not aware;\r\nand that it was a serious one, since engagements signed by herself were\r\nshown about to people who had lent Boehmer money.  Her surprise and\r\nvexation were great.  She desired me to remain at Trianon, and sent off a\r\ncourier to Paris, ordering Boehmer to come to her upon some pretext which\r\nhas escaped my recollection.  He came next morning; in fact it was the day\r\non which the play was performed, and that was the last amusement the Queen\r\nallowed herself at that retreat.\r\n\r\nThe Queen made him enter her closet, and asked him by what fatality it was\r\nthat she was still doomed to hear of his foolish pretence of selling her\r\nan article which she had steadily refused for several years.  He replied\r\nthat he was compelled, being unable to pacify his creditors any longer.\r\n“What are your creditors to me?”  said her Majesty.  Boehmer then\r\nregularly related to her all that he had been made to believe had passed\r\nbetween the Queen and himself through the intervention of the Cardinal.\r\nShe was equally incensed and surprised at each thing she heard.  In vain\r\ndid she speak; the jeweller, equally importunate and dangerous, repeated\r\nincessantly, “Madame, there is no longer time for feigning; condescend to\r\nconfess that you have my necklace, and let some assistance be given to me,\r\nor my bankruptcy will soon bring the whole to light.”\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine how the Queen must have suffered.  On Boehmer’s\r\ngoing away, I found her in an alarming condition; the idea that any one\r\ncould have believed that such a man as the Cardinal possessed her full\r\nconfidence; that she should have employed him to deal with a tradesman\r\nwithout the King’s knowledge, for a thing which she had refused to accept\r\nfrom the King himself, drove her to desperation.  She sent first for the\r\nAbbe de Vermond, and then for the Baron de Breteuil.  Their hatred and\r\ncontempt for the Cardinal made them too easily forget that the lowest\r\nfaults do not prevent the higher orders of the empire from being defended\r\nby those to whom they have the honour to belong; that a Rohan, a Prince of\r\nthe Church, however culpable he might be, would be sure to have a\r\nconsiderable party which would naturally be joined by all the discontented\r\npersons of the Court, and all the frondeurs of Paris. They too easily\r\nbelieved that he would be stripped of all the advantages of his rank and\r\norder, and given up to the disgrace due to his irregular conduct; they\r\ndeceived themselves.\r\n\r\nI saw the Queen after the departure of the Baron and the Abbe; her\r\nagitation made me shudder.  “Fraud must be unmasked,” said she; “when the\r\nRoman purple and the title of Prince cover a mere money-seeker, a cheat\r\nwho dares to compromise the wife of his sovereign, France and all Europe\r\nshould know it.”  It is evident that from that moment the fatal plan was\r\ndecided on.  The Queen perceived my alarm; I did not conceal it from her.\r\nI knew too well that she had many enemies not to be apprehensive on seeing\r\nher attract the attention of the whole world to an intrigue that they\r\nwould try to complicate still more.  I entreated her to seek the most\r\nprudent and moderate advice.  She silenced me by desiring me to make\r\nmyself easy, and to rest satisfied that no imprudence would be committed.\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday, the 15th of August, being the Assumption, at\r\ntwelve o’clock, at the very moment when the Cardinal, dressed in his\r\npontifical garments, was about to proceed to the chapel, he was sent for\r\ninto the King’s closet, where the Queen then was.\r\n\r\nThe King said to him, “You have purchased diamonds of Boehmer?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sire.”\r\n\r\n“What have you done with them?”\r\n\r\n“I thought they had been delivered to the Queen.”\r\n\r\n“Who commissioned you?”\r\n\r\n“A lady, called the Comtesse de Lamotte-Valois, who handed me a letter\r\nfrom the Queen; and I thought I was gratifying her Majesty by taking this\r\nbusiness on myself.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen here interrupted him and said, “How, monsieur, could you believe\r\nthat I should select you, to whom I have not spoken for eight years, to\r\nnegotiate anything for me, and especially through the mediation of a woman\r\nwhom I do not even know?”\r\n\r\n“I see plainly,” said the Cardinal, “that I have been duped.  I will pay\r\nfor the necklace; my desire to please your Majesty blinded me; I suspected\r\nno trick in the affair, and I am sorry for it.”\r\n\r\nHe then took out of his pocket-book a letter from the Queen to Madame de\r\nLamotte, giving him this commission.  The King took it, and, holding it\r\ntowards the Cardinal, said:\r\n\r\n“This is neither written nor signed by the Queen.  How could a Prince of\r\nthe House of Rohan, and a Grand Almoner of France, ever think that the\r\nQueen would sign Marie Antoinette de France?  Everybody knows that queens\r\nsign only by their baptismal names.  But, monsieur,” pursued the King,\r\nhanding him a copy of his letter to Baehmer, “have you ever written such a\r\nletter as this?”\r\n\r\nHaving glanced over it, the Cardinal said, “I do not remember having\r\nwritten it.”\r\n\r\n“But what if the original, signed by yourself, were shown to you?”\r\n\r\n“If the letter be signed by myself it is genuine.”\r\n\r\nHe was extremely confused, and repeated several times, “I have been\r\ndeceived, Sire; I will pay for the necklace.  I ask pardon of your\r\nMajesties.”\r\n\r\n“Then explain to me,” resumed the King, “the whole of this enigma.  I do\r\nnot wish to find you guilty; I had rather you would justify yourself.\r\nAccount for all the manoeuvres with Baehmer, these assurances and these\r\nletters.”\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal then, turning pale, and leaning against the table, said,\r\n“Sire, I am too much confused to answer your Majesty in a way--”\r\n\r\n“Compose yourself, Cardinal, and go into my cabinet; you will there find\r\npaper, pens, and ink,--write what you have to say to me.”\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal went into the King’s cabinet, and returned a quarter of an\r\nhour afterwards with a document as confused as his verbal answers had\r\nbeen.  The King then said, “Withdraw, monsieur.”  The Cardinal left the\r\nKing’s chamber, with the Baron de Breteuil, who gave him in custody to a\r\nlieutenant of the Body Guard, with orders to take him to his apartment. M.\r\nd’Agoult, aide-major of the Body Guard, afterwards took him into custody,\r\nand conducted him to his hotel, and thence to the Bastille.  But while the\r\nCardinal had with him only the young lieutenant of the Body Guard, who was\r\nmuch embarrassed at having such an order to execute, his Eminence met his\r\nheyduc at the door of the Salon of Hercules; he spoke to him in German and\r\nthen asked the lieutenant if he could lend him a pencil; the officer gave\r\nhim that which he carried about him, and the Cardinal wrote to the Abbe\r\nGeorgel, his grand vicar and friend, instantly to burn all Madame de\r\nLamotte’s correspondence, and all his other letters.\r\n\r\n[The Abbe Georgel thus relates the circumstance: “The Cardinal, at that\r\ntrying moment, gave an astonishing proof of his presence of mind;\r\nnotwithstanding the escort which surrounded him, favoured by the attendant\r\ncrowd, he stopped, and stooping down with his face towards the wall, as if\r\nto fasten his buckle, snatched out his pencil and hastily wrote a few\r\nwords upon a scrap of paper placed under his hand in his square red cap.\r\nHe rose again and proceeded. On entering his house, his people formed a\r\nlane; he slipped this paper, unperceived, into the hand of a confidential\r\nvalet de chambre, who waited for him at the door of his apartment.”  This\r\nstory is scarcely credible; it is not at the moment of a prisoner’s\r\narrest, when an inquisitive crowd surrounds and watches him, that he can\r\nstop and write secret messages.  However, the valet de chambre posts off\r\nto Paris.  He arrives at the palace of the Cardinal between twelve and one\r\no’clock; and his horse falls dead in the stable.  “I was in my apartment,”\r\n said the Abbe Georgel, “the valet de chambre entered wildly, with a deadly\r\npaleness on his countenance, and exclaimed, ‘All is lost; the Prince is\r\narrested.’ He instantly fell, fainting, and dropped the note of which he\r\nwas the bearer.”  The portfolio containing the papers which might\r\ncompromise the Cardinal was immediately placed beyond the reach of all\r\nsearch.  Madame de Lamotte also was foolishly allowed sufficient time\r\nafter she heard of the arrest of the Cardinal to burn all the letters she\r\nhad received from him.  Assisted by Beugnot, she completed this at three\r\nthe same morning that she was: arrested at four.--See “Memoirs of Comte de\r\nBeugnot,” vol i., p. 74.]\r\n\r\nThis commission was executed before M. de Crosne, lieutenant of police,\r\nhad received an order from the Baron de Breteuil to put seals upon the\r\nCardinal’s papers.  The destruction of all his Eminence’s correspondence,\r\nand particularly that with Madame de Lamotte, threw an impenetrable cloud\r\nover the whole affair.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment all proofs of this intrigue disappeared.  Madame de\r\nLamotte was apprehended at Bar-sur-Aube; her husband had already gone to\r\nEngland.  From the beginning of this fatal affair all the proceedings of\r\nthe Court appear to have been prompted by imprudence and want of\r\nforesight; the obscurity resulting left free scope for the fables of which\r\nthe voluminous memorials written on one side and the other consisted.  The\r\nQueen so little imagined what could have given rise to the intrigue, of\r\nwhich she was about to become the victim, that, at the moment when the\r\nKing was interrogating the Cardinal, a terrific idea entered her mind.\r\nWith that rapidity of thought caused by personal interest and extreme\r\nagitation, she fancied that, if a design to ruin her in the eyes of the\r\nKing and the French people were the concealed motive of this intrigue, the\r\nCardinal would, perhaps, affirm that she had the necklace; that he had\r\nbeen honoured with her confidence for this purchase, made without the\r\nKing’s knowledge; and point out some secret place in her apartment, where\r\nhe might have got some villain to hide it. Want of money and the meanest\r\nswindling were the sole motives for this criminal affair.  The necklace\r\nhad already been taken to pieces and sold, partly in London, partly in\r\nHolland, and the rest in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe moment the Cardinal’s arrest was known a universal clamour arose.\r\nEvery memorial that appeared during the trial increased the outcry. On\r\nthis occasion the clergy took that course which a little wisdom and the\r\nleast knowledge of the spirit of such a body ought to have foreseen. The\r\nRohans and the House of Conde, as well as the clergy, made their\r\ncomplaints heard everywhere.  The King consented to having a legal\r\njudgment, and early in September he addressed letters-patent to the\r\nParliament, in which he said that he was “filled with the most just\r\nindignation on seeing the means which, by the confession of his Eminence\r\nthe Cardinal, had been employed in order to inculpate his most dear spouse\r\nand companion.”\r\n\r\nFatal moment!  in which the Queen found herself, in consequence of this\r\nhighly impolitic step, on trial with a subject, who ought to have been\r\ndealt with by the power of the King alone.  The Princes and Princesses of\r\nthe House of Conde, and of the Houses of Rohan, Soubise, and Guemenee, put\r\non mourning, and were seen ranged in the way of the members of the Grand\r\nChamber to salute them as they proceeded to the palace, on the days of the\r\nCardinal’s trial; and Princes of the blood openly canvassed against the\r\nQueen of France.\r\n\r\nThe Pope wished to claim, on behalf of the Cardinal de Rohan, the right\r\nbelonging to his ecclesiastical rank, and demanded that he should be\r\njudged at Rome.  The Cardinal de Bernis, ambassador from France to his\r\nHoliness, formerly Minister for Foreign Affairs, blending the wisdom of an\r\nold diplomatist with the principles of a Prince of the Church, wished that\r\nthis scandalous affair should be hushed up.  The King’s aunts, who were on\r\nvery intimate terms with the ambassador, adopted his opinion, and the\r\nconduct of the King and Queen was equally and loudly censured in the\r\napartments of Versailles and in the hotels and coffee-houses of Paris.\r\n\r\nMadame, the King’s sister-in-law, had been the sole protectress of De\r\nLamotte, and had confined her patronage to granting her a pension of\r\ntwelve to fifteen hundred francs.  Her brother was in the navy, but the\r\nMarquis de Chabert, to whom he had been recommended, could never train a\r\ngood officer.  The Queen in vain endeavoured to call to mind the features\r\nof this person, of whom she had often heard as an intriguing woman, who\r\ncame frequently on Sundays to the gallery of Versailles.  At the time when\r\nall France was engrossed by the persecution against the Cardinal, the\r\nportrait of the Comtesse de Lamotte  Valois was publicly sold.  Her\r\nMajesty desired me one day, when I was going to Paris, to buy her the\r\nengraving, which was said to be a tolerable likeness, that she might\r\nascertain whether she could recognise in it any person whom she might have\r\nseen in the gallery.\r\n\r\n[The public, with the exception of the lowest class, were admitted into\r\nthe gallery and larger apartments of Versailles, as they were into the\r\npark.--MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nThe woman De Lamotte’s father was a peasant at Auteuil, though he called\r\nhimself Valois.  Madame de Boulainvilliers once saw from her terrace two\r\npretty little peasant girls, each labouring under a heavy bundle of\r\nsticks.  The priest of the village, who was walking with her, told her\r\nthat the children possessed some curious papers, and that he had no doubt\r\nthey were descendants of a Valois, an illegitimate son of one of the\r\nprinces of that name.\r\n\r\nThe family of Valois had long ceased to appear in the world.  Hereditary\r\nvices had gradually plunged them into the deepest misery.  I have heard\r\nthat the last Valois then known occupied the estate called Gros Bois; that\r\nas he seldom came to Court, Louis XIII. asked him what he was about that\r\nhe remained so constantly in the country; and that this M. de Valois\r\nmerely answered, “Sire, I only do there what I ought.”  It was shortly\r\nafterwards discovered that he was coining.\r\n\r\nNeither the Queen herself nor any one near her ever had the slightest\r\nconnection with the woman De Lamotte; and during her prosecution she could\r\npoint out but one of the Queen’s servants, named Desclos, a valet of the\r\nQueen’s bedchamber, to whom she pre tended she had delivered Boehmer’s\r\nnecklace.  This Desclos was a very honest man; upon being confronted with\r\nthe woman De Lamotte, it was proved that she had never seen him but once,\r\nwhich was at the house of the wife of a surgeon-accoucheur at Versailles,\r\nthe only person she visited at Court; and that she had not given him the\r\nnecklace.  Madame de Lamotte married a private in Monsieur’s body-guard;\r\nshe lodged at Versailles at the Belle Image, a very inferior furnished\r\nhouse; and it is inconceivable how so obscure a person could succeed in\r\nmaking herself believed to be a friend of the Queen, who, though so\r\nextremely affable, seldom granted audiences, and only to titled persons.\r\n\r\nThe trial of the Cardinal is too generally known to require me to repeat\r\nits details here.  The point most embarrassing to him was the interview he\r\nhad in February, 1785, with M. de Saint-James, to whom he confided the\r\nparticulars of the Queen’s pretended commission, and showed the contract\r\napproved and signed Marie Antoinette de France.  The memorandum found in a\r\ndrawer of the Cardinal’s bureau, in which he had himself written what\r\nBaehmer told him after having seen me at my country house, was likewise an\r\nunfortunate document for his Eminence.\r\n\r\nI offered to the King to go and declare that Baehmer had told me that the\r\nCardinal assured him he had received from the Queen’s own hand the thirty\r\nthousand francs given on account upon the bargain being concluded, and\r\nthat his Eminence had seen her Majesty take that sum in bills from the\r\nporcelain secretaire in her boudoir.  The King declined my offer, and said\r\nto me, “Were you alone when Boehmer told you this?”  I answered that I was\r\nalone with him in my garden.  “Well,” resumed he, “the man would deny the\r\nfact; he is now sure of being paid his sixteen hundred thousand francs,\r\nwhich the Cardinal’s family will find it necessary to make good to him; we\r\ncan no longer rely upon his sincerity; it would look as if you were sent\r\nby the Queen, and that would not be proper.”\r\n\r\n[The guilty woman no sooner knew that all was about to be discovered than\r\nshe sent for the jewellers, and told them the Cardinal had perceived that\r\nthe agreement, which he believed to have been signed by the Queen, was a\r\nfalse and forged document.  “However,” added she, “the Cardinal possesses\r\na considerable fortune, and he can very well pay you.”  These words reveal\r\nthe whole secret.  The Countess had taken the necklace to herself, and\r\nflattered herself that M. de Rohan, seeing himself deceived and cruelly\r\nimposed upon, would determine to pay and make the beat terms he could,\r\nrather than suffer a matter of this nature to become public.-“Secret\r\nCorrespondence of the Court of Louis XVI.”]\r\n\r\nThe procureur general’s information was severe on the Cardinal.  The\r\nHouses of Conde and Rohan and the majority of the nobility saw in this\r\naffair only an attack on the Prince’s rank, the clergy only a blow aimed\r\nat the privileges of a cardinal.  The clergy demanded that the unfortunate\r\nbusiness of the Prince Cardinal de Rohan should be submitted to\r\necclesiastical jurisdiction, and the Archbishop of Narbonne, then\r\nPresident of the Convocation, made representations upon the subject to the\r\nKing; the bishops wrote to his Majesty to remind him that a private\r\necclesiastic implicated in the affair then pending would have a right to\r\nclaim his constitutional judges, and that this right was refused to a\r\ncardinal, his superior in the hierarchical order.  In short, the clergy\r\nand the greater part of the nobility were at that time outrageous against\r\nauthority, and chiefly against the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe procureur-general’s conclusions, and those of a part of the heads of\r\nthe magistracy, were as severe towards the Cardinal as the information had\r\nbeen; yet he was fully acquitted by a majority of three voices; the woman\r\nDe Lamotte was condemned to be whipped, branded, and imprisoned; and her\r\nhusband, for contumacy, was condemned to the galleys for life.\r\n\r\n[The following extract is from the “Memoirs” of the Abbe Georgel: “The\r\nsittings were long and multiplied; it was necessary to read the whole\r\nproceedings; more than fifty judges sat; a master of requests; a friend of\r\nthe Prince, wrote down all that was said there, and sent it to his\r\nadvisers, who found means to inform the Cardinal of it, and to add the\r\nplan of conduct he ought to pursue.”  D’Epremesnil, and other young\r\ncounsellors, showed upon that occasion but too much audacity in braving\r\nthe Court, too much eagerness in seizing an opportunity of attacking it.\r\nThey were the first to shake that authority which their functions made it\r\na duty in them to respect.--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nM. Pierre de Laurencel, the procureur general’s substitute, sent the Queen\r\na list of the names of the members of the Grand Chamber, with the means\r\nmade use of by the friends of the Cardinal to gain their votes during the\r\ntrial.  I had this list to keep among the papers which the Queen deposited\r\nin the house of M. Campan, my father-in-law, and which, at his death, she\r\nordered me to preserve.  I burnt this statement, but I remember ladies\r\nperformed a part not very creditable to their principles; it was by them,\r\nin consideration of large sums which they received, that some of the\r\noldest and most respected members were won over.  I did not see a single\r\nname amongst the whole Parliament that was gained directly.\r\n\r\nThe belief confirmed by time is, that the Cardinal was completely duped by\r\nthe woman De Lamotte and Cagliostro.  The King may have been in error in\r\nthinking him an accomplice in this miserable and criminal scheme, but I\r\nhave faithfully repeated his Majesty’s judgment about it.\r\n\r\nHowever, the generally received opinion that the Baron de Breteuil’s\r\nhatred for the Cardinal was the cause of the scandal and the unfortunate\r\nresult of this affair contributed to the disgrace of the former still more\r\nthan his refusal to give his granddaughter in marriage to the son of the\r\nDuc de Polignac.  The Abbe de Vermond threw the whole blame of the\r\nimprudence and impolicy of the affair of the Cardinal de Rohan upon the\r\nminister, and ceased to be the friend and supporter of the Baron de\r\nBreteuil with the Queen.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the year 1786, the Cardinal, as has been said, was\r\nfully acquitted, and came out of the Bastille, while Madame de Lamotte was\r\ncondemned to be whipped, branded, and imprisoned.  The Court, persisting\r\nin the erroneous views which had hitherto guided its measures, conceived\r\nthat the Cardinal and the woman De Lamotte were equally culpable and\r\nunequally punished, and sought to restore the balance of justice by\r\nexiling the Cardinal to La Chaise-Dieu, and suffering Madame de Lamotte to\r\nescape a few days after she entered l’Hopital.  This new error confirmed\r\nthe Parisians in the idea that the wretch De Lamotte, who had never been\r\nable to make her way so far as to the room appropriated to the Queen’s\r\nwomen, had really interested the Queen herself.\r\n\r\n[Further particulars will be found in the “Memoirs of the Comte de\r\nBeugnot” (London: Hurst & Blackett, 1871), as he knew Madame de Lamotte\r\nfrom the days of her early childhood (when the three children, the Baron\r\nde Valois, who died captain of a frigate, and the two Mademoiselles de\r\nSaint-Remi, the last descendants of the Baron de Saint-Remi, a natural son\r\nof Henri II., were almost starving) to the time of her temporary\r\nprosperity.  In fact, he was with her when she burnt the correspondence of\r\nthe Cardinal, in the interval the Court foolishly allowed between his\r\narrest and her capture, and De Beugnot believed he had met at her house,\r\nat the moment of their return from their successful trick, the whole party\r\nengaged in deluding the Cardinal.  It is worth noting that he was then\r\nstruck by the face of Mademoiselle d’Oliva, who had just personated the\r\nQueen in presenting a rose to the Cardinal.  It may also be cited as a\r\npleasing quality of Madame de Lamotte that she, “in her ordinary\r\nconversation, used the words stupid and honest as synonymous.”--See\r\n“Beugnot,” vol. i., p. 60.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Abbe de Vermond could not repress his exultation when he succeeded in\r\ngetting the Archbishop of Sens appointed head of the council of finance. I\r\nhave more than once heard him say that seventeen years of patience were\r\nnot too long a term for success in a Court; that he spent all that time in\r\ngaining the end he had in view; but that at length the Archbishop was\r\nwhere he ought to be for the good of the State.  The Abbe, from this time,\r\nin the Queen’s private circle no longer concealed his credit and\r\ninfluence; nothing could equal the confidence with which he displayed the\r\nextent of his pretensions.  He requested the Queen to order that the\r\napartments appropriated to him should be enlarged, telling her that, being\r\nobliged to give audiences to bishops, cardinals, and ministers, he\r\nrequired a residence suitable to his present circumstances.  The Queen\r\ncontinued to treat him as she did before the Archbishop’s arrival at\r\nCourt; but the household showed him increased consideration: the word\r\n“Monsieur” preceded that of Abbe; and from that moment not only the livery\r\nservants, but also the people of the antechambers rose when Monsieur\r\nl’Abbe was passing, though there never was, to my knowledge, any order\r\ngiven to that effect.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was obliged, on account of the King’s disposition and the very\r\nlimited confidence he placed in the Archbishop of Sens, to take a part in\r\npublic affairs.  While M. de Maurepas lived she kept out of that danger,\r\nas may be seen by the censure which the Baron de Besenval passes on her in\r\nhis memoirs for not availing herself of the conciliation he had promoted\r\nbetween the Queen and that minister, who counteracted the ascendency which\r\nthe Queen and her intimate friends might otherwise have gained over the\r\nKing’s mind.\r\n\r\nThe Queen has often assured me that she never interfered respecting the\r\ninterests of Austria but once; and that was only to claim the execution of\r\nthe treaty of alliance at the time when Joseph II. was at war with Prussia\r\nand Turkey; that, she then demanded that an army of twenty-four thousand\r\nmen should be sent to him instead of fifteen millions, an alternative\r\nwhich had been left to option in the treaty, in case the Emperor should\r\nhave a just war to maintain; that she could not obtain her object, and M.\r\nde Vergennes, in an interview which she had with him upon the subject, put\r\nan end to her importunities by observing that he was answering the mother\r\nof the Dauphin and not the sister of the Emperor. The fifteen millions\r\nwere sent.  There was no want of money at Vienna, and the value of a\r\nFrench army was fully appreciated.\r\n\r\n“But how,” said the Queen, “could they be so wicked as to send off those\r\nfifteen millions from the general post-office, diligently publishing, even\r\nto the street porters, that they were loading carriages with money that I\r\nwas sending to my brother!--whereas it is certain that the money would\r\nequally have been sent if I had belonged to another house; and, besides,\r\nit was sent contrary to my inclination.”\r\n\r\n[This was not the first time the Queen had become unpopular in consequence\r\nof financial support afforded by France to her brother. The Emperor Joseph\r\nII, made, in November, 1783, and in May, 1784, startling claims on the\r\nrepublic of the United Provinces; he demanded the opening of the Scheldt,\r\nthe cession of Maeatricht with its dependencies, of the country beyond the\r\nMeuse, the county of Vroenhoven, and a sum of seventy millions of florins.\r\nThe first gun was fired by the Emperor on the Scheldt 6th November, 1784.\r\nPeace was concluded 8th November, 1785, through the mediation of France.\r\nThe singular part was the indemnification granted to the Emperor: this was\r\na sum of ten millions of Dutch florins; the articles 15, 16, and 17 of the\r\ntreaty stipulated the quotas of it.  Holland paid five millions and a\r\nhalf, and France, under the direction of M. de Vergennes, four millions\r\nand a half of florins, that is to say, nine millions and forty-five\r\nthousand francs, according to M. Soulavie. M. de augur, in his “Policy of\r\nCabinets” (vol. iii.), says relative to this affair:\r\n\r\n“M. de Vergennes has been much blamed for having terminated, by a\r\nsacrifice of seven millions, the contest that existed between the United\r\nProvinces and the Emperor.  In that age of philosophy men were still very\r\nuncivilised; in that age of commerce they made very erroneous\r\ncalculations; and those who accused the Queen of sending the gold of\r\nFrance to her brother would have been better pleased if, to support a\r\nrepublic devoid of energy, the blood of two hundred thousand men, and\r\nthree or four hundred millions of francs, had been sacrificed, and at the\r\nsame time the risk run of losing the advantage of peace dictated to\r\nEngland.”  MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Comte de Moustier set out on his mission to the United States,\r\nafter having had his public audience of leave he came and asked me to\r\nprocure him a private one.  I could not succeed even with the strongest\r\nsolicitations; the Queen desired me to wish him a good voyage, but added\r\nthat none but ministers could have anything to say to him in private,\r\nsince he was going to a country where the names of King and Queen must be\r\ndetested.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette had then no direct influence over State affairs until\r\nafter the deaths of M. de Maurepas and M. de Vergennes, and the retirement\r\nof M. de Calonne.  She frequently regretted her new situation, and looked\r\nupon it as a misfortune which she could not avoid.  One day, while I was\r\nassisting her to tie up a number of memorials and reports, which some of\r\nthe ministers had handed to her to be given to the King, “Ah!” said she,\r\nsighing, “there is an end of all happiness for me, since they have made an\r\nintriguer of me.”  I exclaimed at the word.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” resumed, the Queen, “that is the right term; every woman who\r\nmeddles with affairs above her understanding or out of her line of duty is\r\nan intriguer and nothing else; you will remember, however, that it is not\r\nmy own fault, and that it is with regret I give myself such a title;\r\nQueens of France are happy only so long as they meddle with nothing, and\r\nmerely preserve influence sufficient to advance their friends and reward a\r\nfew zealous servants.  Do you know what happened to me lately?  One day\r\nsince I began to attend private committees at the King’s, while crossing\r\nthe oiel-de-boeuf, I heard one of the musicians of the chapel say so loud\r\nthat I lost not a single word, ‘A Queen who does her duty will remain in\r\nher apartment to knit.’ I said within myself, ‘Poor wretch, thou art\r\nright; but thou knowest not my situation; I yield to necessity and my evil\r\ndestiny.’”\r\n\r\nThis situation was the more painful to the Queen inasmuch as Louis XVI.\r\nhad long accustomed himself to say nothing to her respecting State\r\naffairs; and when, towards the close of his reign, she was obliged to\r\ninterfere in the most important matters, the same habit in the King\r\nfrequently kept from her particulars which it was necessary she should\r\nhave known.  Obtaining, therefore, only insufficient information, and\r\nguided by persons more ambitious than skilful, the Queen could not be\r\nuseful in important affairs; yet, at the same time, her ostensible\r\ninterference drew upon her, from all parties and all classes of society,\r\nan unpopularity the rapid progress of which alarmed all those who were\r\nsincerely attached to her.\r\n\r\nCarried away by the eloquence of the Archbishop of Sens, and encouraged in\r\nthe confidence she placed in that minister by the incessant eulogies of\r\nthe Abbe de Vermond on his abilities, the Queen unfortunately followed up\r\nher first mistake of bringing him into office in 1787 by supporting him at\r\nthe time of his disgrace, which was obtained by the despair of a whole\r\nnation.  She thought it was due to her dignity to give him some marked\r\nproof of her regard at the moment of his departure; misled by her\r\nfeelings, she sent him her portrait enriched with jewelry, and a brevet\r\nfor the situation of lady of the palace for Madame de Canisy, his niece,\r\nobserving that it was necessary to indemnify a minister sacrificed to the\r\nintrigues of the Court and a factious spirit of the nation; that otherwise\r\nnone would be found willing to devote themselves to the interests of the\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the Archbishop’s departure the public joy was universal,\r\nboth at Court and at Paris there were bonfires; the attorneys’ clerks\r\nburnt the Archbishop in effigy, and on the evening of his disgrace more\r\nthan a hundred couriers were sent out from Versailles to spread the happy\r\ntidings among the country seats.  I have seen the Queen shed bitter tears\r\nat the recollection of the errors she committed at this period, when\r\nsubsequently, a short time before her death, the Archbishop had the\r\naudacity to say, in a speech which was printed, that the sole object of\r\none part of his operations, during his administration, was the salutary\r\ncrisis which the Revolution had produced.\r\n\r\nThe benevolence and generosity shown by the King and Queen during the\r\nsevere winter of 1788, when the Seine was frozen over and the cold was\r\nmore intense than it had been for eighty years, procured them some\r\nfleeting popularity.  The gratitude of the Parisians for the succour their\r\nMajesties poured forth was lively if not lasting.  The snow was so\r\nabundant that since that period there has never been seen such a\r\nprodigious quantity in France.  In different parts of Paris pyramids and\r\nobelisks of snow were erected with inscriptions expressive of the\r\ngratitude of the people.  The pyramid in the Rue d’Angiviller was\r\nsupported on a base six feet high by twelve broad; it rose to the height\r\nof fifteen feet, and was terminated by a globe.  Four blocks of stone,\r\nplaced at the angles, corresponded with the obelisk, and gave it an\r\nelegant appearance.  Several inscriptions, in honour of the King and\r\nQueen, were affixed to it.  I went to see this singular monument, and\r\nrecollect the following inscription:\r\n\r\n“TO MARIE ANTOINETTE.”\r\n           “Lovely and good, to tender pity true,\r\n          Queen of a virtuous King, this trophy view;\r\n          Cold ice and snow sustain its fragile form,\r\n          But ev’ry grateful heart to thee is warm.\r\n          Oh, may this tribute in your hearts excite,\r\n          Illustrious pair, more pure and real delight,\r\n          Whilst thus your virtues are sincerely prais’d,\r\n          Than pompous domes by servile flatt’ry rais’d.”\r\n The theatres generally rang with praises of the beneficence of the\r\nsovereigns: “La Partie de Chasse de Henri IV.” was represented for the\r\nbenefit of the poor.  The receipts were very considerable.\r\n\r\nWhen the fruitless measure of the Assembly of the Notables, and the\r\nrebellious spirit in the parliaments, had created the necessity for\r\nStates General, it was long discussed in council whether they should be\r\nassembled at Versailles or at forty or sixty leagues from the capital;\r\nthe Queen was for the latter course, and insisted to the King that they\r\nought to be far away from the immense population of Paris.\r\n\r\n[The Assembly of the Notables, as may be seen in “Weber’s Memoirs,” vol.\r\ni., overthrew the plans and caused the downfall of M. de Calonne.  A\r\nprince of the blood presided over each of the meetings of that assembly.\r\nMonsieur, afterwards Louis XVIII., presided over the first meeting.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” says a contemporary, “gained great reputation at the Assembly\r\nof the Notables in 1787.  He did not miss attending his meeting a single\r\nday, and he displayed truly patriotic virtues. His care in discussing the\r\nweighty matters of administration, in throwing light upon them, and in\r\ndefending the interests and the cause of the people, was such as even to\r\ninspire the King with some degree of jealousy.  Monsieur openly said that\r\na respectful resistance to the orders of the monarch was not blamable, and\r\nthat authority might be met by argument, and forced to receive information\r\nwithout any offence whatever.”--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nShe feared that the people would influence the deliberations of the\r\ndeputies; several memorials were presented to the King upon that\r\nquestion; but M. Necker prevailed, and Versailles was the place fixed\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nThe day on which the King announced that he gave his consent to the\r\nconvocation of the States General, the Queen left the public dinner, and\r\nplaced herself in the recess of the first window of her bedchamber, with\r\nher face towards the garden.  Her chief butler followed her, to present\r\nher coffee, which she usually took standing, as she was about to leave the\r\ntable.  She beckoned to me to come close to her.  The King was engaged in\r\nconversation with some one in his room.  When the attendant had served her\r\nhe retired; and she addressed me, with the cup still in her hand: “Great\r\nHeavens! what fatal news goes forth this day!  The King assents to the\r\nconvocation of the States General.”  Then she added, raising her eyes to\r\nheaven, “I dread it; this important event is a first fatal signal of\r\ndiscord in France.”  She cast her eyes down, they were filled with tears.\r\nShe could not take the remainder of her coffee, but handed me the cup, and\r\nwent to join the King.  In the evening, when she was alone with me, she\r\nspoke only of this momentous decision.  “It is the Parliament,” said she,\r\n“that has compelled the King to have recourse to a measure long considered\r\nfatal to the repose of the kingdom.  These gentlemen wish to restrain the\r\npower of the King; but they give a great shock to the authority of which\r\nthey make so bad a use, and they will bring on their own destruction.”\r\n\r\nThe double representation granted to the Tiers Etat was now the chief\r\ntopic of conversation.  The Queen favoured this plan, to which the King\r\nhad agreed; she thought the hope of obtaining ecclesiastical favours would\r\nsecure the clergy of the second order, and that M. Necker was sure to have\r\nthe same degree of influence over the lawyers, and other people of that\r\nclass comprised in the Tiers Dat.  The Comte d’Artois, holding the\r\ncontrary opinion, presented a memorial in the names of himself and several\r\nprinces of the blood to the King against the double representation.  The\r\nQueen was displeased with him for this; her confidential advisers infused\r\ninto her apprehensions that the Prince was made the tool of a party; but\r\nhis conduct was approved of by Madame de Polignac’s circle, which the\r\nQueen thenceforward only frequented to avoid the appearance of a change in\r\nher habits.  She almost always returned unhappy; she was treated with the\r\nprofound respect due to a queen, but the devotion of friendship had\r\nvanished, to make way for the coldness of etiquette, which wounded her\r\ndeeply.  The alienation between her and the Comte Artois was also very\r\npainful to her, for she had loved him almost as tenderly as if he had been\r\nher own brother.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the States General took place on the 4th of May, 1789. The\r\nQueen on that occasion appeared for the last time in her life in regal\r\nmagnificence.  During the procession some low women, seeing the Queen\r\npass, cried out “Vive le Duc d’ Orleans!”  in so threatening a manner that\r\nshe nearly fainted.  She was obliged to be supported, and those about her\r\nwere afraid it would be necessary to stop the procession. The Queen,\r\nhowever, recovered herself, and much regretted that she had not been able\r\nto command more presence of mind.\r\n\r\nThe rapidly increasing distrust of the King and Queen shown by the\r\npopulace was greatly attributable to incessant corruption by English gold,\r\nand the projects, either of revenge or of ambition, of the Duc d’Orleans.\r\nLet it not be thought that this accusation is founded on what has been so\r\noften repeated by the heads of the French Government since the Revolution.\r\nTwice between the 14th of July and the 6th of October, 1789, the day on\r\nwhich the Court was dragged to Paris, the Queen prevented me from making\r\nlittle excursions thither of business or pleasure, saying to me, “Do not\r\ngo on such a day to Paris; the English have been scattering gold, we shall\r\nhave some disturbance.”  The repeated visits of the Duc d’Orleans to\r\nEngland had excited the Anglomania to such a pitch that Paris was no\r\nlonger distinguishable from London.  The French, formerly imitated by the\r\nwhole of Europe, became on a sudden a nation of imitators, without\r\nconsidering the evils that arts and manufactures must suffer in\r\nconsequence of the change.  Since the treaty of commerce made with England\r\nat the peace of 1783, not merely equipages, but everything, even to\r\nribands and common earthenware, were of English make.  If this\r\npredominance of English fashions had been confined to filling our\r\ndrawing-rooms with young men in English frock-coats, instead of the French\r\ndress, good taste and commerce might alone have suffered; but the\r\nprinciples of English government had taken possession of these young\r\nheads.  Constitution, Upper House, Lower House, national guarantee,\r\nbalance of power, Magna Charta, Law of Habeas Corpus,--all these words\r\nwere incessantly repeated, and seldom understood; but they were of\r\nfundamental importance to a party which was then forming.\r\n\r\nThe first sitting of the States took place on the following day.  The King\r\ndelivered his speech with firmness and dignity; the Queen told me that he\r\nhad taken great pains about it, and had repeated it frequently. His\r\nMajesty gave public marks of attachment and respect for the Queen, who was\r\napplauded; but it was easy to see that this applause was in fact rendered\r\nto the King alone.\r\n\r\nIt was evident, during the first sittings, that Mirabeau would be very\r\ndangerous to the Government.  It affirmed that at this period he\r\ncommunicated to the King, and still more fully to the Queen, part of his\r\nschemes for abandoning them.  He brandished the weapons afforded him by\r\nhis eloquence and audacity, in order to make terms with the party he meant\r\nto attack.  This man played the game of revolution to make his own\r\nfortune.  The Queen told me that he asked for an embassy, and, if my\r\nmemory does not deceive me, it was that of Constantinople.  He was refused\r\nwith well-deserved contempt, though policy would doubtless have concealed\r\nit, could the future have been foreseen.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm prevailing at the opening of this assembly, and the debates\r\nbetween the Tiers Etat, the nobility, and even the clergy, daily increased\r\nthe alarm of their Majesties, and all who were attached to the cause of\r\nmonarchy.  The Queen went to bed late, or rather she began to be unable to\r\nrest.  One evening, about the end of May, she was sitting in her room,\r\nrelating several remarkable occurrences of the day; four wax candles were\r\nplaced upon her toilet-table; the first went out of itself; I relighted\r\nit; shortly afterwards the second, and then the third went out also; upon\r\nwhich the Queen, squeezing my hand in terror, said to me: “Misfortune\r\nmakes us superstitious; if the fourth taper should go out like the rest,\r\nnothing can prevent my looking upon it as a sinister omen.”  The fourth\r\ntaper went out.  It was remarked to the Queen that the four tapers had\r\nprobably been run in the same mould, and that a defect in the wick had\r\nnaturally occurred at the same point in each, since the candles had all\r\ngone out in the order in which they had been lighted.\r\n\r\nThe deputies of the Tiers Etat arrived at Versailles full of the strongest\r\nprejudices against the Court.  They believed that the King indulged in the\r\npleasures of the table to a shameful excess; and that the Queen was\r\ndraining the treasury of the State in order to satisfy the most unbridled\r\nluxury.  They almost all determined to see Petit Trianon.  The extreme\r\nplainness of the retreat in question not answering the ideas they had\r\nformed, some of them insisted upon seeing the very smallest closets,\r\nsaying that the richly furnished apartments were concealed from them. They\r\nparticularised one which, according to them, was ornamented with diamonds,\r\nand with wreathed columns studded with sapphires and rubies. The Queen\r\ncould not get these foolish ideas out of her mind, and spoke to the King\r\non the subject.  From the description given of this room by the deputies\r\nto the keepers of Trianon, the King concluded that they were looking for\r\nthe scene enriched with paste ornaments, made in the reign of Louis XV.\r\nfor the theatre of Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\nThe King supposed that his Body Guards, on their return to the country,\r\nafter their quarterly duty at Court, related what they had seen, and that\r\ntheir exaggerated accounts, being repeated, became at last totally\r\nperverted.  This idea of the King, after the search for the diamond\r\nchamber, suggested to the Queen that the report of the King’s propensity\r\nfor drinking also sprang from the guards who accompanied his carriage when\r\nhe hunted at Rambouillet.  The King, who disliked sleeping out of his\r\nusual bed, was accustomed to leave that hunting-seat after supper; he\r\ngenerally slept soundly in his carriage, and awoke only on his arrival at\r\nthe courtyard of his palace; he used to get down from his carriage in the\r\nmidst of his Body Guards, staggering, as a man half awake will do, which\r\nwas mistaken for intoxication.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the deputies who came imbued with prejudices produced by\r\nerror or malevolence, went to lodge with the most humble private\r\nindividuals of Versailles, whose inconsiderate conversation contributed\r\nnot a little to nourish such mistakes.  Everything, in short, tended to\r\nrender the deputies subservient to the schemes of the leaders of the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nShortly after the opening of the States General the first Dauphin died.\r\nThat young Prince suffered from the rickets, which in a few months curved\r\nhis spine, and rendered his legs so weak that he could not walk without\r\nbeing supported like a feeble old man.\r\n\r\n[Louis, Dauphin of France, who died at Versailles on the 4th of June,\r\n1789, gave promise of intellectual precocity.  The following particulars,\r\nwhich convey some idea of his disposition, and of the assiduous attention\r\nbestowed upon him by the Duchesse de Polignac, will be found in a work of\r\nthat time: “At two years old the Dauphin was very pretty; he articulated\r\nwell, and answered questions put to him intelligently.  While he was at\r\nthe Chateau de La Muette everybody was at liberty to see him.  The Dauphin\r\nwas dressed plainly, like a sailor; there was nothing to distinguish him\r\nfrom other children in external appearance but the cross of Saint Louis,\r\nthe blue ribbon, and the Order of the Fleece, decorations that are the\r\ndistinctive signs of his rank.  The Duchesse Jules de Polignac, his\r\ngoverness, scarcely ever left him for a single instant: she gave up all\r\nthe Court excursions and amusements in order to devote her whole attention\r\nto him.  The Prince always manifested a great regard for M. de Bourset,\r\nhis valet de chambre.  During the illness of which he died, he one day\r\nasked for a pair of scissors; that gentleman reminded him that they were\r\nforbidden.  The child insisted mildly, and they were obliged to yield to\r\nhim.  Having got the scissors, he cut off a lock of his hair, which he\r\nwrapped in a sheet of paper: ‘There, monsieur,’ said he to his valet de\r\nchambre,’ there is the only present I can make you, having nothing at my\r\ncommand; but when I am dead you will present this pledge to my papa and\r\nmamma; and while they remember me, I hope they will not forget\r\nyou.’”--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nHow many maternal tears did his condition draw from the Queen, already\r\noverwhelmed with apprehensions respecting the state of the kingdom!  Her\r\ngrief was enhanced by petty intrigues, which, when frequently renewed,\r\nbecame intolerable.  An open quarrel between the families and friends of\r\nthe Duc Harcourt, the Dauphin’s governor, and those of the Duchesse de\r\nPolignac, his governess, added greatly to the Queen’s affliction.  The\r\nyoung Prince showed a strong dislike to the Duchesse de Polignac, who\r\nattributed it either to the Duc or the Duchesse d’Harcourt, and came to\r\nmake her complaints respecting it to the Queen.  The Dauphin twice sent\r\nher out of his room, saying to her, with that maturity of manner which\r\nlong illness always gives to children: “Go out, Duchess; you are so fond\r\nof using perfumes, and they always make me ill;” and yet she never used\r\nany.  The Queen perceived, also, that his prejudices against her friend\r\nextended to herself; her son would no longer speak in her presence.  She\r\nknew that he had become fond of sweetmeats, and offered him some\r\nmarshmallow and jujube lozenges.  The under-governors and the first valet\r\nde chambre requested her not to give the Dauphin anything, as he was to\r\nreceive no food of any kind without the consent of the faculty. I forbear\r\nto describe the wound this prohibition inflicted upon the Queen; she felt\r\nit the more deeply because she was aware it was unjustly believed she gave\r\na decided preference to the Duc de Normandie, whose ruddy health and\r\namiability did, in truth, form a striking contrast to the languid look and\r\nmelancholy disposition of his elder brother.  She even suspected that a\r\nplot had for some time existed to deprive her of the affection of a child\r\nwhom she loved as a good and tender mother ought.  Previous to the\r\naudience granted by the King on the 10th August, 1788, to the envoy of the\r\nSultan Tippoo Saib, she had begged the Duc d’Harcourt to divert the\r\nDauphin, whose deformity was already apparent, from his, intention to be\r\npresent at that ceremony, being unwilling to expose him to the gaze of the\r\ncrowd of inquisitive Parisians who would be in the gallery.\r\nNotwithstanding this injunction, the Dauphin was suffered to write to his\r\nmother, requesting her permission to be present at the audience.  The\r\nQueen was obliged to refuse him, and warmly reproached the governor, who\r\nmerely answered that he could not oppose the wishes of a sick child.  A\r\nyear before the death of the Dauphin the Queen lost the Princesse Sophie;\r\nthis was, as the Queen said, the first of a series of misfortunes.\r\n\r\nNOTE:  As Madame Campan has stated in the foregoing pages that the money\r\nto foment sedition was furnished from English sources, the decree of the\r\nConvention of August, 1793, maybe quoted as illustrative of the entente\r\ncordiale alleged to exist between the insurrectionary Government and its\r\nfriends across the Channel!

In\r\nthis seance the King declared that the Orders must vote separately, and\r\nthreatened, if further obstacles were met with, to himself act for the\r\ngood of the people.  The Queen looked on M. Necker’s not accompanying the\r\nKing as treachery or criminal cowardice: she said that he had converted a\r\nremedy into poison; that being in full popularity, his audacity, in openly\r\ndisavowing the step taken by his sovereign, had emboldened the factious,\r\nand led away the whole Assembly; and that he was the more culpable\r\ninasmuch as he had the evening before given her his word to accompany the\r\nKing.  In vain did M. Necker endeavour to excuse himself by saying that\r\nhis advice had not been followed.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards the insurrections of the 11th, 12th, and 14th of\r\nJuly--[The Bastille was taken on the 14th July, 1789.]--opened the\r\ndisastrous drama with which France was threatened.  The massacre of M. de\r\nFlesselles and M. de Launay drew bitter tears from the Queen, and the idea\r\nthat the King had lost such devoted subjects wounded her to the heart.\r\n\r\nThe character of the movement was no longer merely that of a popular\r\ninsurrection; cries of “Vive la Nation!  Vive le Roi!  Vive la Liberte!”\r\n threw the strongest light upon the views of the reformers.  Still the\r\npeople spoke of the King with affection, and appeared to think him\r\nfavourable to the national desire for the reform of what were called\r\nabuses; but they imagined that he was restrained by the opinions and\r\ninfluence of the Comte d’Artois and the Queen; and those two august\r\npersonages were therefore objects of hatred to the malcontents.  The\r\ndangers incurred by the Comte d’Artois determined the King’s first step\r\nwith the States General.  He attended their meeting on the morning of the\r\n15th of July with his brothers, without pomp or escort; he spoke standing\r\nand uncovered, and pronounced these memorable words: “I trust myself to\r\nyou; I only wish to be at one with my nation, and, counting on the\r\naffection and fidelity of my subjects, I have given orders to the troops\r\nto remove from Paris and Versailles.”  The King returned on foot from the\r\nchamber of the States General to his palace; the deputies crowded after\r\nhim, and formed his escort, and that of the Princes who accompanied him.\r\nThe rage of the populace was pointed against the Comte d’Artois, whose\r\nunfavourable opinion of the double representation was an odious crime in\r\ntheir eyes.  They repeatedly cried out, “The King for ever, in spite of\r\nyou and your opinions, Monseigneur!” One woman had the impudence to come\r\nup to the King and ask him whether what he had been doing was done\r\nsincerely, and whether he would not be forced to retract it.\r\n\r\nThe courtyards of the Chateau were thronged with an immense concourse of\r\npeople; they demanded that the King and Queen, with their children, should\r\nmake their appearance in the balcony.  The Queen gave me the key of the\r\ninner doors, which led to the Dauphin’s apartments, and desired me to go\r\nto the Duchesse de Polignac to tell her that she wanted her son, and had\r\ndirected me to bring him myself into her room, where she waited to show\r\nhim to the people.  The Duchess said this order indicated that she was not\r\nto accompany the Prince.  I did not answer; she squeezed my hand, saying,\r\n“Ah! Madame Campan, what a blow I receive!”  She embraced the child and me\r\nwith tears.  She knew how much I loved and valued the goodness and the\r\nnoble simplicity of her disposition.  I endeavoured to reassure her by\r\nsaying that I should bring back the Prince to her; but she persisted, and\r\nsaid she understood the order, and knew what it meant. She then retired to\r\nher private room, holding her handkerchief to her eyes.  One of the\r\nunder-governesses asked me whether she might go with the Dauphin; I told\r\nher the Queen had given no order to the contrary, and we hastened to her\r\nMajesty, who was waiting to lead the Prince to the balcony.\r\n\r\nHaving executed this sad commission, I went down into the courtyard, where\r\nI mingled with the crowd.  I heard a thousand vociferations; it was easy\r\nto see, by the difference between the language and the dress of some\r\npersons among the mob, that they were in disguise.  A woman, whose face\r\nwas covered with a black lace veil, seized me by the arm with some\r\nviolence, and said, calling me by my name, “I know you very well; tell\r\nyour Queen not to meddle with government any longer; let her leave her\r\nhusband and our good States General to effect the happiness of the\r\npeople.”  At the same moment a man, dressed much in the style of a\r\nmarketman, with his hat pulled down over his eyes, seized me by the other\r\narm, and said, “Yes, yes; tell her over and over again that it will not be\r\nwith these States as with the others, which produced no good to the\r\npeople; that the nation is too enlightened in 1789 not to make something\r\nmore of them; and that there will not now be seen a deputy of the ‘Tiers\r\nEtat’ making a speech with one knee on the ground; tell her this, do you\r\nhear?”  I was struck with dread; the Queen then appeared in the balcony.\r\n“Ah!” said the woman in the veil, “the Duchess is not with her.”--“No,”\r\n replied the man, “but she is still at Versailles; she is working\r\nunderground, molelike; but we shall know how to dig her out.”  The\r\ndetestable pair moved away from me, and I reentered the palace, scarcely\r\nable to support myself.  I thought it my duty to relate the dialogue of\r\nthese two strangers to the Queen; she made me repeat the particulars to\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\nAbout four in the afternoon I went across the terrace to Madame Victoire’s\r\napartments; three men had stopped under the windows of the throne-chamber.\r\n“Here is that throne,” said one of them aloud, “the vestiges of which will\r\nsoon be sought for.”  He added a thousand invectives against their\r\nMajesties.  I went in to the Princess, who was at work alone in her\r\ncloset, behind a canvass blind, which prevented her from being seen by\r\nthose without.  The three men were still walking upon the terrace; I\r\nshowed them to her, and told her what they had said.  She rose to take a\r\nnearer view of them, and informed me that one of them was named\r\nSaint-Huruge; that he was sold to the Duc d’Orleans, and was furious\r\nagainst the Government, because he had been confined once under a ‘lettre\r\nde cachet’ as a bad character.\r\n\r\nThe King was not ignorant of these popular threats; he also knew the days\r\non which money was scattered about Paris, and once or twice the Queen\r\nprevented my going there, saying there would certainly be a riot the next\r\nday, because she knew that a quantity of crown pieces had been distributed\r\nin the faubourgs.\r\n\r\n[I have seen a six-franc crown piece, which certainly served to pay some\r\nwretch on the night of the 12th of July; the words “Midnight, 12th July,\r\nthree pistols,” were rather deeply engraven on it.  They were, no doubt, a\r\npassword for the first insurrection.--MADAME COMPAN]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 14th of July the King came to the Queen’s\r\napartments, where I was with her Majesty alone; he conversed with her\r\nrespecting the scandalous report disseminated by the factious, that he had\r\nhad the Chamber of the National Assembly undermined, in order to blow it\r\nup; but he added that it became him to treat such absurd assertions with\r\ncontempt, as usual; I ventured to tell him that I had the evening before\r\nsupped with M. Begouen, one of the deputies, who said that there were very\r\nrespectable persons who thought that this horrible contrivance had been\r\nproposed without the King’s knowledge.  “Then,” said his Majesty, “as the\r\nidea of such an atrocity was not revolting to so worthy a man as M.\r\nBegouen, I will order the chamber to be examined early to-morrow morning.”\r\n In fact, it will be seen by the King’s, speech to the National Assembly,\r\non the 15th of July, that the suspicions excited obtained his attention.\r\n“I know,” said he in the speech in question, “that unworthy insinuations\r\nhave been made; I know there are those who have dared to assert that your\r\npersons are not safe; can it be necessary to give you assurances upon the\r\nsubject of reports so culpable, denied beforehand by my known character?”\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the 15th of July produced no mitigation of the\r\ndisturbances.  Successive deputations of poissardes came to request the\r\nKing to visit Paris, where his presence alone would put an end to the\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th a committee was held in the King’s apartments, at which a most\r\nimportant question was discussed: whether his Majesty should quit\r\nVersailles and set off with the troops whom he had recently ordered to\r\nwithdraw, or go to Paris to tranquillise the minds of the people.  The\r\nQueen was for the departure.  On the evening of the 16th she made me take\r\nall her jewels out of their cases, to collect them in one small box, which\r\nshe might carry off in her own carriage.  With my assistance she burnt a\r\nlarge quantity of papers; for Versailles was then threatened with an early\r\nvisit of armed men from Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, on the morning of the 16th, before attending another committee\r\nat the King’s, having got her jewels ready, and looked over all her\r\npapers, gave me one folded up but not sealed, and desired me not to read\r\nit until she should give me an order to do so from the King’s room, and\r\nthat then I was to execute its contents; but she returned herself about\r\nten in the morning; the affair was decided; the army was to go away\r\nwithout the King; all those who were in imminent danger were to go at the\r\nsame time.  “The King will go to the Hotel de Ville to-morrow,” said the\r\nQueen to me; “he did not choose this course for himself; there were long\r\ndebates on the question; at last the King put an end to them by rising and\r\nsaying, ‘Well, gentlemen, we must decide; am I to go or to stay?  I am\r\nready to do either.’  The majority were for the King staying; time will\r\nshow whether the right choice has been made.”  I returned the Queen the\r\npaper she had given me, which was now useless; she read it to me; it\r\ncontained her orders for the departure; I was to go with her, as well on\r\naccount of my office about her person as to serve as a teacher to Madame.\r\nThe Queen tore the paper, and said, with tears in her eyes, “When I wrote\r\nthis I thought it would be useful, but fate has ordered otherwise, to the\r\nmisfortune of us all, as I much fear.”\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the troops the new administration received thanks;\r\nM. Necker was recalled.  The artillery soldiers were undoubtedly\r\ncorrupted.  “Wherefore all these guns?”  exclaimed the crowds of women who\r\nfilled the streets.  “Will you kill your mothers, your wives, your\r\nchildren?”--“Don’t be afraid,” answered the soldiers; “these guns shall\r\nrather be levelled against the tyrant’s palace than against you!”\r\n\r\nThe Comte d’Artois, the Prince de Conde, and their children set off at the\r\nsame time with the troops.  The Duc and Duchesse de Polignac, their\r\ndaughter, the Duchesse de Guiche, the Comtesse Diane de Polignac, sister\r\nof the Duke, and the Abbe de Baliviere, also emigrated on the same night.\r\nNothing could be more affecting than the parting of the Queen and her\r\nfriend; extreme misfortune had banished from their minds the recollection\r\nof differences to which political opinions alone had given rise.  The\r\nQueen several times wished to go and embrace her once more after their\r\nsorrowful adieu, but she was too closely watched.  She desired M. Campan\r\nto be present at the departure of the Duchess, and gave him a purse of\r\nfive hundred Louis, desiring him to insist upon her allowing the Queen to\r\nlend her that sum to defray her expenses on the road.  The Queen added\r\nthat she knew her situation; that she had often calculated her income, and\r\nthe expenses occasioned by her place at Court; that both husband and wife\r\nhaving no other fortune than their official salaries, could not possibly\r\nhave saved anything, however differently people might think at Paris.\r\n\r\nM. Campan remained till midnight with the Duchess to see her enter her\r\ncarriage.  She was disguised as a femme de chambre, and got up in front of\r\nthe Berlin; she requested M. Campan to remember her frequently to the\r\nQueen, and then quitted for ever that palace, that favour, and that\r\ninfluence which had raised her up such cruel enemies.  On their arrival at\r\nSens the travellers found the people in a state of insurrection; they\r\nasked all those who came from Paris whether the Polignacs were still with\r\nthe Queen.  A group of inquisitive persons put that question to the Abbe\r\nde Baliviere, who answered them in the firmest tone, and with the most\r\ncavalier air, that they were far enough from Versailles, and that we had\r\ngot rid of all such bad people.  At the following stage the postilion got\r\non the doorstep and said to the Duchess, “Madame, there are some good\r\npeople left in the world: I recognised you all at Sens.”  They gave the\r\nworthy fellow a handful of gold.\r\n\r\nOn the breaking out of these disturbances an old man above seventy years\r\nof age gave the Queen an extraordinary proof of attachment and fidelity.\r\nM. Peraque, a rich inhabitant of the colonies, father of M. d’Oudenarde,\r\nwas coming from Brussels to Paris; while changing horses he was met by a\r\nyoung man who was leaving France, and who recommended him if he carried\r\nany letters from foreign countries to burn them immediately, especially if\r\nhe had any for the Queen.  M. Peraque had one from the Archduchess, the\r\nGouvernante of the Low Countries, for her Majesty.  He thanked the\r\nstranger, and carefully concealed his packet; but as he approached Paris\r\nthe insurrection appeared to him so general and so violent, that he\r\nthought no means could be relied on for securing this letter from seizure.\r\nHe took upon him to unseal it, and learned it by heart, which was a\r\nwonderful effort for a man at his time of life, as it contained four pages\r\nof writing.  On his arrival at Paris he wrote it down, and then presented\r\nit to the Queen, telling her that the heart of an old and faithful subject\r\nhad given him courage to form and execute such a resolution.  The Queen\r\nreceived M. Peraque in her closet, and expressed her gratitude in an\r\naffecting manner most honourable to the worthy old man.  Her Majesty\r\nthought the young stranger who had apprised him of the state of Paris was\r\nPrince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, who was very devoted to her, and who\r\nleft Paris at that time.\r\n\r\nThe Marquise de Tourzel replaced the Duchess de Polignac.  She was\r\nselected by the Queen as being the mother of a family and a woman of\r\nirreproachable conduct, who had superintended the education of her own\r\ndaughters with the greatest success.\r\n\r\nThe King went to Paris on the 17th of July, accompanied by the Marechal de\r\nBeauvau, the Duc de Villeroi, and the Duc de Villequier; he also took the\r\nComte d’Estaing, and the Marquis de Nesle, who were then very popular, in\r\nhis carriage.  Twelve Body Guards, and the town guard of Versailles,\r\nescorted him to the Pont du Jour, near Sevres, where the Parisian guard\r\nwas waiting for him.  His departure caused equal grief and alarm to his\r\nfriends, notwithstanding the calmness he exhibited.  The Queen restrained\r\nher tears, and shut herself up in her private rooms with her family.  She\r\nsent for several persons belonging to her Court; their doors were locked.\r\nTerror had driven them away.  The silence of death reigned throughout the\r\npalace; they hardly dared hope that the King would return?  The Queen had\r\na robe prepared for her, and sent orders to her stables to have all her\r\nequipages ready.  She wrote an address of a few lines for the Assembly,\r\ndetermining to go there with her family, the officers of her palace, and\r\nher servants, if the King should be detained prisoner at Paris.  She got\r\nthis address by heart; it began with these words: “Gentlemen, I come to\r\nplace in your hands the wife and family of your sovereign; do not suffer\r\nthose who have been united in heaven to be put asunder on earth.”  While\r\nshe was repeating this address she was often interrupted by tears, and\r\nsorrowfully exclaimed: “They will not let him return!”\r\n\r\nIt was past four when the King, who had left Versailles at ten in the\r\nmorning, entered the Hotel de Ville.  At length, at six in the evening, M.\r\nde Lastours, the King’s first page, arrived; he was not half an hour in\r\ncoming from the Barriere de la Conference to Versailles.  Everybody knows\r\nthat the moment of calm in Paris was that in which the unfortunate\r\nsovereign received the tricoloured cockade from M. Bailly, and placed it\r\nin his hat.  A shout of “Vive le Roi!” arose on all sides; it had not been\r\nonce uttered before.  The King breathed again, and with tears in his eyes\r\nexclaimed that his heart stood in need of such greetings from the people.\r\nOne of his equerries (M. de Cubieres) told him the people loved him, and\r\nthat he could never have doubted it.  The King replied in accents of\r\nprofound sensibility:\r\n\r\n“Cubieres, the French loved Henri IV., and what king ever better deserved\r\nto be beloved?”\r\n\r\n[Louis XVI. cherished the memory of Henri IV.: at that moment he thought\r\nof his deplorable end; but he long before regarded him as a model.\r\nSoulavie says on the subject: “A tablet with the inscription ‘Resurrexit’\r\nplaced upon the pedestal of Henri IV.’s statue on the accession of Louis\r\nXVI. flattered him exceedingly.  ‘What a fine compliment,’ said he, ‘if it\r\nwere true!  Tacitus himself never wrote anything so concise or so happy.’\r\nLouis XVI. wished to take the reign of that Prince for a model.  In the\r\nfollowing year the party that raised a commotion among the people on\r\naccount of the dearness of corn removed the tablet inscribed Resurrexit\r\nfrom the statue of Henri IV., and placed it under that of Louis XV., whose\r\nmemory was then detested, as he was believed to have traded on the\r\nscarcity of food.  Louis XVI., who was informed of it, withdrew into his\r\nprivate apartments, where he was found in a fever shedding tears; and\r\nduring the whole of that day he could not be prevailed upon either to\r\ndine, walk out, or sup.  From this circumstance we may judge what he\r\nendured at the commencement of the Revolution, when he was accused of not\r\nloving the French people.”--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nHis return to Versailles filled his family with inexpressible joy; in the\r\narms of the Queen, his sister, and his children, he congratulated himself\r\nthat no accident had happened; and he repeated several times, “Happily no\r\nblood has been shed, and I swear that never shall a drop of French blood\r\nbe shed by my order,”--a determination full of humanity, but too openly\r\navowed in such factious times!\r\n\r\nThe King’s last measure raised a hope in many that general tranquillity\r\nwould soon enable the Assembly to resume its, labours, and promptly bring\r\nits session to a close.  The Queen never flattered herself so far; M.\r\nBailly’s speech to the King had equally wounded her pride and hurt her\r\nfeelings.  “Henri IV. conquered his people, and here are the people\r\nconquering their King.”  The word “conquest” offended her; she never\r\nforgave M. Bailly for this fine academical phrase.\r\n\r\nFive days after the King’s visit to Paris, the departure of the troops,\r\nand the removal of the Princes and some of the nobility whose influence\r\nseemed to alarm the people, a horrible deed committed by hired assassins\r\nproved that the King had descended the steps of his throne without having\r\neffected a reconciliation with his people.\r\n\r\nM. Foulon, adjoint to the administration while M. de Broglie was\r\ncommanding the army assembled at Versailles, had concealed himself at\r\nViry.  He was there recognised, and the peasants seized him, and dragged\r\nhim to the Hotel de Ville.  The cry for death was heard; the electors, the\r\nmembers of committee, and M. de La Fayette, at that time the idol of\r\nParis, in vain endeavoured to save the unfortunate man.  After tormenting\r\nhim in a manner which makes humanity shudder, his body was dragged about\r\nthe streets, and to the Palais Royal, and his heart was carried by women\r\nin the midst of a bunch of white carnations!  M. Berthier, M. Foulon’s\r\nson-in-law, intendant of Paris, was seized at Compiegne, at the same time\r\nthat his father-in-law was seized at Viry, and treated with still more\r\nrelentless cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was always persuaded that this horrible deed was occasioned by\r\nsome indiscretion; and she informed me that M. Foulon had drawn up two\r\nmemorials for the direction of the King’s conduct at the time of his being\r\ncalled to Court on the removal of M. Necker; and that these memorials\r\ncontained two schemes of totally different nature for extricating the King\r\nfrom the dreadful situation in which he was placed. In the first of these\r\nprojects M. Foulon expressed himself without reserve respecting the\r\ncriminal views of the Duc d’Orleans; said that he ought to be put under\r\narrest, and that no time should be lost in commencing a prosecution\r\nagainst him, while the criminal tribunals were still in existence; he\r\nlikewise pointed out such deputies as should be apprehended, and advised\r\nthe King not to separate himself from his army until order was restored.\r\n\r\nHis other plan was that the King should make himself master of the\r\nrevolution before its complete explosion; he advised his Majesty to go to\r\nthe Assembly, and there, in person, to demand the cahiers, and to make\r\nthe greatest sacrifices to satisfy the legitimate wishes of the people,\r\nand not to give the factious time to enlist them in aid of their\r\ncriminal designs.\r\n\r\n[Cahiers, the memorials or lists of complaints, grievances, and\r\nrequirements of the electors drawn up by the primary assemblies and sent\r\nwith the deputies.]\r\n\r\nMadame Adelaide had M. Foulon’s two memorials read to her in the\r\npresence of four or five persons.  One of them, Comte Louis de Narbonne,\r\nwas very intimate with Madame de Stael, and that intimacy gave the Queen\r\nreason to believe that the opposite party had gained information of M.\r\nFoulon’s schemes.\r\n\r\nIt is known that young Barnave, during an aberration of mind, since\r\nexpiated by sincere repentance, and even by death, uttered these atrocious\r\nwords: “Is then the blood now, flowing so pure?” when M. Berthier’s son\r\ncame to the Assembly to implore the eloquence of M. de Lally to entreat\r\nthat body to save his father’s life.  I have since been informed that a\r\nson of M. Foulon, having returned to France after these first ebullitions\r\nof the Revolution, saw Barnave, and gave him one of those memorials in\r\nwhich M. Foulon advised Louis XVI. to prevent the revolutionary explosion\r\nby voluntarily granting all that the Assembly required before the 14th of\r\nJuly.  “Read this memorial,” said he; “I have brought it to increase your\r\nremorse: it is the only revenge I wish to inflict on you.”  Barnave burst\r\ninto tears, and said to him all that the profoundest grief could dictate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the 14th of July, by a manoeuvre for which the most skilful factions\r\nof any age might have envied the Assembly, the whole population of France\r\nwas armed and organised into a National Guard.  A report was spread\r\nthroughout France on the same day, and almost at the same hour, that four\r\nthousand brigands were marching towards such towns or villages as it was\r\nwished to induce to take arms.  Never was any plan better laid; terror\r\nspread at the same moment all over the kingdom.  In 1791 a peasant showed\r\nme a steep rock in the mountains of the Mont d’Or on which his wife\r\nconcealed herself on the day when the four thousand brigands were to\r\nattack their village, and told me they had been obliged to make use of\r\nropes to let her down from the height which fear alone had enabled her to\r\nclimb.\r\n\r\nVersailles was certainly the place where the national military uniform\r\nappeared most offensive.  All the King’s valets, even of the lowest class,\r\nwere metamorphosed into lieutenants or captains; almost all the musicians\r\nof the chapel ventured one day to make their appearance at the King’s mass\r\nin a military costume; and an Italian soprano adopted the uniform of a\r\ngrenadier captain.  The King was very much offended at this conduct, and\r\nforbade his servants to appear in his presence in so unsuitable a dress.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the Duchesse de Polignac naturally left the Abbe de\r\nVermond exposed to all the dangers of favouritism.  He was already talked\r\nof as an adviser dangerous to the nation.  The Queen was alarmed at it,\r\nand recommended him to remove to Valenciennes, where Count Esterhazy was\r\nin command.  He was obliged to leave that place in a few days and set off\r\nfor Vienna, where he remained.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 17th of July the Queen, being unable to sleep, made me\r\nwatch by her until three in the morning.  I was extremely surprised to\r\nhear her say that it would be a very long time before the Abbe de Vermond\r\nwould make his appearance at Court again, even if the existing ferment\r\nshould subside, because he would not readily be forgiven for his\r\nattachment to the Archbishop of Sens; and that she had lost in him a very\r\ndevoted servant.  Then she suddenly remarked to me, that although he was\r\nnot much prejudiced against me I could not have much regard for him,\r\nbecause he could not bear my father-in-law to hold the place of secretary\r\nof the closet.  She went on to say that I must have studied the Abbe’s\r\ncharacter, and, as I had sometimes drawn her portraits of living\r\ncharacters, in imitation of those which were fashionable in the time of\r\nLouis XIV., she desired me to sketch that of the Abbe, without any\r\nreserve.  My astonishment was extreme; the Queen spoke of the man who, the\r\nday before, had been in the greatest intimacy with her with the utmost\r\ncoolness, and as a person whom, perhaps, she might never see again!  I\r\nremained petrified; the Queen persisted, and told me that he had been the\r\nenemy of my family for more than twelve years, without having been able to\r\ninjure it in her opinion; so that I had no occasion to dread his return,\r\nhowever severely I might depict him.  I promptly summarised my ideas about\r\nthe favourite; but I only remember that the portrait was drawn with\r\nsincerity, except that everything which could denote antipathy was kept\r\nout of it.  I shall make but one extract from it: I said that he had been\r\nborn talkative and indiscreet, and had assumed a character of singularity\r\nand abruptness in order to conceal those two failings.  The Queen\r\ninterrupted me by saying, “Ah! how true that is!”  I have since discovered\r\nthat, notwithstanding the high favour which the Abbe de Vermond enjoyed,\r\nthe Queen took precautions to guard herself against an ascendency the\r\nconsequences of which she could not calculate.\r\n\r\nOn the death of my father-in-law his executors placed in my hands a box\r\ncontaining a few jewels deposited by the Queen with M. Campan on the\r\ndeparture from Versailles of the 6th of October, and two sealed packets,\r\neach inscribed, “Campan will take care of these papers for me.”  I took\r\nthe two packets to her Majesty, who kept the jewels and the larger packet,\r\nand, returning me the smaller, said, “Take care of that for me as your\r\nfather-in-law did.”\r\n\r\nAfter the fatal 10th of August, 1792,--[The day of the attack on the\r\nTuileries, slaughter of the Swiss guard, and suspension of the King from\r\nhis functions.]--when my house was about to be surrounded, I determined to\r\nburn the most interesting papers of which I was the depositary; I thought\r\nit my duty, however, to open this packet, which it might perhaps be\r\nnecessary for me to preserve at all hazards. I saw that it contained a\r\nletter from the Abbe de Vermond to the Queen. I have already related that\r\nin the earlier days of Madame de Polignac’s favour he determined to remove\r\nfrom Versailles, and that the Queen recalled him by means of the Comte de\r\nMercy.  This letter contained nothing but certain conditions for his\r\nreturn; it was the most whimsical of treaties; I confess I greatly\r\nregretted being under the necessity of destroying it.  He reproached the\r\nQueen for her infatuation for the Comtesse Jules, her family, and society;\r\nand told her several truths about the possible consequences of a\r\nfriendship which ranked that lady among the favourites of the Queens of\r\nFrance, a title always disliked by the nation.  He complained that his\r\nadvice was neglected, and then came to the conditions of his return to\r\nVersailles; after strong assurances that he would never, in all his life,\r\naim at the higher church dignities, he said that he delighted in an\r\nunbounded confidence; and that he asked but two things of her Majesty as\r\nessential: the first was, not to give him her orders through any third\r\nperson, and to write to him herself; he complained much that he had had no\r\nletter in her own hand since he had left Vienna; then he demanded of her\r\nan income of eighty thousand livres, in ecclesiastical benefices; and\r\nconcluded by saying that, if she condescended to assure him herself that\r\nshe would set about procuring him what he wished, her letter would be\r\nsufficient in itself to show him that her Majesty had accepted the two\r\nconditions he ventured to make respecting his return.  No doubt the letter\r\nwas written; at least it is very certain that the benefices were granted,\r\nand that his absence from Versailles lasted only a single week.\r\n\r\nIn the course of July, 1789, the regiment of French guards, which had been\r\nin a state of insurrection from the latter end of June, abandoned its\r\ncolours.  One single company of grenadiers remained faithful, to its post\r\nat Versailles.  M. le Baron de Leval was the captain of this company.  He\r\ncame every evening to request me to give the Queen an account of the\r\ndisposition of his soldiers; but M. de La Fayette having sent them a note,\r\nthey all deserted during the night and joined their comrades, who were\r\nenrolled in the Paris guard; so that Louis XVI. on rising saw no guard\r\nwhatever at the various posts entrusted to them.\r\n\r\nThe decrees of the 4th of August, by which all privileges were abolished,\r\nare well known.\r\n\r\n[“It was during the night of the 4th of August,” says Rivarol, “that the\r\ndemagogues of the nobility, wearied with a protracted discussion upon the\r\nrights of man, and burning to signalise their zeal, rose all at once, and\r\nwith loud exclamations called for the last sighs of the feudal system.\r\nThis demand electrified the Assembly.  All heads were frenzied.  The\r\nyounger sons of good families, having nothing, were delighted to sacrifice\r\ntheir too fortunate elders upon the altar of the country; a few country\r\ncures felt no less pleasure in renouncing the benefices of others; but\r\nwhat posterity will hardly believe is that the same enthusiasm infected\r\nthe whole nobility; zeal walked hand in hand with malevolence; they made\r\nsacrifice upon sacrifice.  And as in Japan the point of honour lies in a\r\nman’s killing himself in the presence of the person who has offended him,\r\nso did the deputies of the nobility vie in striking at themselves and\r\ntheir constituents.  The people who were present at this noble contest\r\nincreased the intoxication of their new allies by their shouts; and the\r\ndeputies of the commons, seeing that this memorable night would only\r\nafford them profit without honour, consoled their self-love by wondering\r\nat what Nobility, grafted upon the Third Estate, could do.  They named\r\nthat night the ‘night of dupes’; the nobles called it the ‘night of\r\nsacrifices’.”--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThe King sanctioned all that tended to the diminution of his own personal\r\ngratifications, but refused his consent to the other decrees of that\r\ntumultuous night; this refusal was one of the chief causes of the ferments\r\nof the month of October.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of September meetings were held at the Palais Royal, and\r\npropositions made to go to Versailles; it was said to be necessary to\r\nseparate the King from his evil counsellors, and keep him, as well as the\r\nDauphin, at the Louvre.  The proclamations by the officers of the commune\r\nfor the restoration of tranquillity were ineffectual; but M. de La Fayette\r\nsucceeded this time in dispersing the populace.  The Assembly declared\r\nitself permanent; and during the whole of September, in which no doubt the\r\npreparations were made for the great insurrections of the following month,\r\nthe Court was not disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe King had the Flanders regiment removed to Versailles; unfortunately\r\nthe idea of the officers of that regiment fraternising with the Body\r\nGuards was conceived, and the latter invited the former to a dinner, which\r\nwas given in the great theatre of Versailles, and not in the Salon of\r\nHercules, as some chroniclers say.  Boxes were appropriated to various\r\npersons who wished to be present at this entertainment.  The Queen told me\r\nshe had been advised to make her appearance on the occasion, but that\r\nunder existing circumstances she thought such a step might do more harm\r\nthan good; and that, moreover, neither she nor the King ought directly to\r\nhave anything to do with such a festival.  She ordered me to go, and\r\ndesired me to observe everything closely, in order to give a faithful\r\naccount of the whole affair.\r\n\r\nThe tables were set out upon the stage; at them were placed one of the\r\nBody Guard and an officer of the Flanders regiment alternately.  There was\r\na numerous orchestra in the room, and the boxes were filled with\r\nspectators.  The air, “O Richard, O mon Roi!” was played, and shouts of\r\n“Vive de Roi!” shook the roof for several minutes.  I had with me one of\r\nmy nieces, and a young person brought up with Madame by her Majesty. They\r\nwere crying “Vive le Roi!” with all their might when a deputy of the Third\r\nEstate, who was in the next box to mine, and whom I had never seen, called\r\nto them, and reproached them for their exclamations; it hurt him, he said,\r\nto see young and handsome Frenchwomen brought up in such servile habits,\r\nscreaming so outrageously for the life of one man, and with true\r\nfanaticism exalting him in their hearts above even their dearest\r\nrelations; he told them what contempt worthy American women would feel on\r\nseeing Frenchwomen thus corrupted from their earliest infancy.  My niece\r\nreplied with tolerable spirit, and I requested the deputy to put an end to\r\nthe subject, which could by no means afford him any satisfaction, inasmuch\r\nas the young persons who were with me lived, as well as myself, for the\r\nsole purpose of serving and loving the King.  While I was speaking what\r\nwas my astonishment at seeing the King, the Queen, and the Dauphin enter\r\nthe chamber!  It was M. de Luxembourg who had effected this change in the\r\nQueen’s determination.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm became general; the moment their Majesties arrived the\r\norchestra repeated the air I have just mentioned, and afterwards played a\r\nsong in the “Deserter,” “Can we grieve those whom we love?”  which also\r\nmade a powerful impression upon those present: on all sides were heard\r\npraises of their Majesties, exclamations of affection, expressions of\r\nregret for what they had suffered, clapping of hands, and shouts of “Vive\r\nle Roi! Vive la Reine! Vive le Dauphin!”  It has been said that white\r\ncockades were worn on this occasion; that was not the case; the fact is,\r\nthat a few young men belonging to the National Guard of Versailles, who\r\nwere invited to the entertainment, turned the white lining of their\r\nnational cockades outwards.  All the military men quitted the hall, and\r\nreconducted the King and his family to their apartments.  There was\r\nintoxication in these ebullitions of joy: a thousand extravagances were\r\ncommitted by the military, and many of them danced under the King’s\r\nwindows; a soldier belonging to the Flanders regiment climbed up to the\r\nbalcony of the King’s chamber in order to shout “Vive le Roi!”  nearer his\r\nMajesty; this very soldier, as I have been told by several officers of the\r\ncorps, was one of the first and most dangerous of their insurgents in the\r\nriots of the 5th and 6th of October.  On the same evening another soldier\r\nof that regiment killed himself with a sword.  One of my relations,\r\nchaplain to the Queen, who supped with me, saw him stretched out in a\r\ncorner of the Place d’Armes; he went to him to give him spiritual\r\nassistance, and received his confession and his last sighs. He destroyed\r\nhimself out of regret at having suffered himself to be corrupted by the\r\nenemies of his King, and said that, since he had seen him and the Queen\r\nand the Dauphin, remorse had turned his brain.\r\n\r\nI returned home, delighted with all that I had seen.\r\n\r\nI found a great many people there.  M. de Beaumetz, deputy for Arras,\r\nlistened to my description with a chilling air, and, when I had finished,\r\ntold me that all that had passed was terrific; that he knew the\r\ndisposition of the Assembly, and that the greatest misfortunes would\r\nfollow the drama of that night; and he begged my leave to withdraw that he\r\nmight take time for deliberate reflection whether he should on the very\r\nnext day emigrate, or pass over to the left side of the Assembly. He\r\nadopted the latter course, and never appeared again among my associates.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of October the military entertainment was followed up by a\r\nbreakfast given at the hotel of the Body Guards.  It is said that a\r\ndiscussion took place whether they should not march against the Assembly;\r\nbut I am utterly ignorant of what passed at that breakfast.  From that\r\nmoment Paris was constantly in commotion; there were continual mobs, and\r\nthe most virulent proposals were heard in all public places; the\r\nconversation was invariably about proceeding to Versailles.  The King and\r\nQueen did not seem apprehensive of such a measure, and took no precaution\r\nagainst it; even when the army had actually left Paris, on the evening of\r\nthe 5th of October, the King was shooting at Meudon, and the Queen was\r\nalone in her gardens at Trianon, which she then beheld for the last time\r\nin her life.  She was sitting in her grotto absorbed in painful\r\nreflection, when she received a note from the Comte de Saint-Priest,\r\nentreating her to return to Versailles.  M. de Cubieres at the same time\r\nwent off to request the King to leave his sport and return to the palace;\r\nthe King did so on horseback, and very leisurely.  A few minutes\r\nafterwards he was informed that a numerous body of women, which preceded\r\nthe Parisian army, was at Chaville, at the entrance of the avenue from\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of bread and the entertainment of the Body Guards were the\r\npretexts for the insurrection of the 5th and 6th of October, 1789; but it\r\nis clear to demonstration that this new movement of the people was a part\r\nof the original plan of the factious, insomuch as, ever since the\r\nbeginning of September, a report had been industriously circulated that\r\nthe King intended to withdraw, with his family and ministers, to some\r\nstronghold; and at all the popular assemblies there had been always a\r\ngreat deal said about going to Versailles to seize the King.\r\n\r\nAt first only women showed themselves; the latticed doors of the Chateau\r\nwere closed, and the Body Guard and Flanders regiment were drawn up in the\r\nPlace d’Armes.  As the details of that dreadful day are given with\r\nprecision in several works, I will only observe that general consternation\r\nand disorder reigned throughout the interior of the palace.\r\n\r\nI was not in attendance on the Queen at this time.  M. Campan remained\r\nwith her till two in the morning.  As he was leaving her she\r\ncondescendingly, and with infinite kindness, desired him to make me easy\r\nas to the dangers of the moment, and to repeat to me M. de La Fayette’s\r\nown words, which he had just used on soliciting the royal family to retire\r\nto bed, undertaking to answer for his army.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was far from relying upon M. de La Fayette’s loyalty; but she\r\nhas often told me that she believed on that day, that La Fayette, having\r\naffirmed to the King, in the presence of a crowd of witnesses, that he\r\nwould answer for the army of Paris, would not risk his honour as a\r\ncommander, and was sure of being able to redeem his pledge.  She also\r\nthought the Parisian army was devoted to him, and that all he said about\r\nhis being forced to march upon Versailles was mere pretence.\r\n\r\nOn the first intimation of the march of the Parisians, the Comte de\r\nSaint-Priest prepared Rambouillet for the reception of the King, his\r\nfamily, and suite, and the carriages were even drawn out; but a few cries\r\nof “Vive le Roi!”  when the women reported his Majesty’s favourable\r\nanswer, occasioned the intention of going away to be given up, and orders\r\nwere given to the troops to withdraw.\r\n\r\n[Compare this account with the particulars given in the “Memoirs” of\r\nFerribres, Weber, Bailly, and Saint-Priest, from the latter of which the\r\nfollowing sentence is taken:\r\n\r\n“M. d’Estaing knew not what to do with the Body Guards beyond bringing\r\nthem into the courtyard of the ministers, and shutting the grilles.\r\nThence they proceeded to the terrace of the Chateau, then to Trianon, and\r\nlastly to Rambouillet.\r\n\r\n“I could not refrain from expressing to M. d’Estaing, when he came to the\r\nKing, my astonishment at not seeing him make any military disposition.\r\n‘Monsieur,’ replied he, ‘I await the orders of the King’ (who did not open\r\nhis mouth).  ‘When the King gives no orders,’ pursued I, ‘a general should\r\ndecide for himself in a soldierly manner.’  This observation remained\r\nunanswered.”]\r\n\r\nThe Body Guards were, however, assailed with stones and musketry while\r\nthey were passing from the Place d’Armes to, their hotel.  Alarm revived;\r\nagain it was thought necessary that the royal family should go away; some\r\ncarriages still remained ready for travelling; they were called for; they\r\nwere stopped by a wretched player belonging to the theatre of the town,\r\nseconded by the mob: the opportunity for flight had been lost.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection was directed against the Queen in particular; I shudder\r\neven now at the recollection of the poissardes, or rather furies, who wore\r\nwhite aprons, which they screamed out were intended to receive the bowels\r\nof Marie Antoinette, and that they would make cockades of them, mixing the\r\nmost obscene expressions with these horrible threats.\r\n\r\nThe Queen went to bed at two in the morning, and even slept, tired out\r\nwith the events of so distressing a day.  She had ordered her two women to\r\nbed, imagining there was nothing to dread, at least for that night; but\r\nthe unfortunate Princess was indebted for her life to that feeling of\r\nattachment which prevented their obeying her.  My sister, who was one of\r\nthe ladies in question, informed me next day of all that I am about to\r\nrelate.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Queen’s bedchamber, these ladies called their femmes de\r\nchambre, and all four remained sitting together against her Majesty’s\r\nbedroom door.  About half-past four in the morning they heard horrible\r\nyells and discharges of firearms; one ran to the Queen to awaken her and\r\nget her out of bed; my sister flew to the place from which the tumult\r\nseemed to proceed; she opened the door of the antechamber which leads to\r\nthe great guard-room, and beheld one of the Body Guard holding his musket\r\nacross the door, and attacked by a mob, who were striking at him; his face\r\nwas covered with blood; he turned round and exclaimed: “Save the Queen,\r\nmadame; they are come to assassinate her!”  She hastily shut the door upon\r\nthe unfortunate victim of duty, fastened it with the great bolt, and took\r\nthe same precaution on leaving the next room.  On reaching the Queen’s\r\nchamber she cried out to her, “Get up, Madame!  Don’t stay to dress\r\nyourself; fly to the King’s apartment!”  The terrified Queen threw herself\r\nout of bed; they put a petticoat upon her without tying it, and the two\r\nladies conducted her towards the oile-de-boeuf.  A door, which led from\r\nthe Queen’s dressing-room to that apartment, had never before been\r\nfastened but on her side.  What a dreadful moment!  It was found to be\r\nsecured on the other side.  They knocked repeatedly with all their\r\nstrength; a servant of one of the King’s valets de chambre came and opened\r\nit; the Queen entered the King’s chamber, but he was not there. Alarmed\r\nfor the Queen’s life, he had gone down the staircases and through the\r\ncorridors under the oeil-de-boeuf, by means of which he was accustomed to\r\ngo to the Queen’s apartments without being under the necessity of crossing\r\nthat room.  He entered her Majesty’s room and found no one there but some\r\nBody Guards, who had taken refuge in it.  The King, unwilling to expose\r\ntheir lives, told them to wait a few minutes, and afterwards sent to\r\ndesire them to go to the oeil-de-boeuf.  Madame de Tourzel, at that time\r\ngoverness of the children of France, had just taken Madame and the Dauphin\r\nto the King’s apartments.  The Queen saw her children again.  The reader\r\nmust imagine this scene of tenderness and despair.\r\n\r\nIt is not true that the assassins penetrated to the Queen’s chamber and\r\npierced the bed with their swords.  The fugitive Body Guards were the only\r\npersons who entered it; and if the crowd had reached so far they would all\r\nhave been massacred.  Besides, when the rebels had forced the doors of the\r\nantechamber, the footmen and officers on duty, knowing that the Queen was\r\nno longer in her apartments, told them so with that air of truth which\r\nalways carries conviction.  The ferocious horde instantly rushed towards\r\nthe oeil-de-boeuf, hoping, no doubt, to intercept her on her way.\r\n\r\nMany have asserted that they recognised the Duc d’Orleans in a greatcoat\r\nand slouched hat, at half-past four in the morning, at the top of the\r\nmarble staircase, pointing out with his hand the guard-room, which led to\r\nthe Queen’s apartments.  This fact was deposed to at the Chatelet by\r\nseveral individuals in the course of the inquiry instituted respecting the\r\ntransactions of the 5th and 6th of October.\r\n\r\n[The National Assembly was sitting when information of the march of the\r\nParisians was given to it by one of the deputies who came from Paris.  A\r\ncertain number of the members were no strangers, to this movement.  It\r\nappears that Mirabeau wished to avail himself of it to raise the Duc\r\nd’Orleans to the throne.  Mounier, who presided over the National\r\nAssembly, rejected the idea with horror.  “My good man,” said Mirabeau to\r\nhim, “what difference will it make to you to have Louis XVII. for your\r\nKing instead of Louis XVI.?” (The Duc d’Orleans was baptised Louis.)]\r\n\r\nThe prudence and honourable feeling of several officers of the Parisian\r\nguards, and the judicious conduct of M. de Vaudreuil, lieutenant-general\r\nof marine, and of M. de Chevanne, one of the King’s Guards, brought about\r\nan understanding between the grenadiers of the National Guard of Paris and\r\nthe King’s Guard.  The doors of the oeil-de-boeuf were closed, and the\r\nantechamber which precedes that room was filled with grenadiers who wanted\r\nto get in to massacre the Guards.  M. de Chevanne offered himself to them\r\nas a victim if they wished for one, and demanded what they would have.  A\r\nreport had been spread through their ranks that the Body Guards set them\r\nat defiance, and that they all wore black cockades.  M. de Chevanne showed\r\nthem that he wore, as did the corps, the cockade of their uniform; and\r\npromised that the Guards should exchange it for that of the nation.  This\r\nwas done; they even went so far as to exchange their grenadiers’ caps for\r\nthe hats of the Body Guards; those who were on guard took off their\r\nshoulder-belts; embraces and transports of fraternisation instantly\r\nsucceeded to the savage eagerness to murder the band which had shown so\r\nmuch fidelity to its sovereign.  The cry was now “Vivent le Roi, la\r\nNation, et les Gardes-du-corps!”\r\n\r\nThe army occupied the Place d’Armes, all the courtyards of the Chateau,\r\nand the entrance to the avenue.  They called for the Queen to appear in\r\nthe balcony: she came forward with Madame and the Dauphin.  There was a\r\ncry of “No children!”  Was this with a view to deprive her of the interest\r\nshe inspired, accompanied as she was by her young family, or did the\r\nleaders of the democrats hope that some madman would venture to aim a\r\nmortal blow at her person?  The unfortunate Princess certainly was\r\nimpressed with the latter idea, for she sent away her children, and with\r\nher hands and eyes raised towards heaven, advanced upon the balcony like a\r\nself-devoted victim.\r\n\r\nA few voices shouted “To Paris!”  The exclamation soon became general.\r\nBefore the King agreed to this removal he wished to consult the National\r\nAssembly, and caused that body to be invited to sit at the Chateau.\r\nMirabeau opposed this measure.  While these discussions were going forward\r\nit became more and more difficult to restrain the immense disorderly\r\nmultitude.  The King, without consulting any one, now said to the people:\r\n“You wish, my children, that I should follow you to Paris: I consent, but\r\non condition that I shall not be separated from my wife and family.”  The\r\nKing added that he required safety also for his Guards; he was answered by\r\nshouts of “Vivo le Roi!  Vivent les Gardes-du-corps!” The Guards, with\r\ntheir hats in the air, turned so as to exhibit the cockade, shouted “Vive\r\nle Roi!  Vive la Nation!”  shortly afterwards a general discharge of all\r\nthe muskets took place, in token of joy.  The King and Queen set off from\r\nVersailles at one o’clock.  The Dauphin, Madame, the King’s daughter,\r\nMonsieur, Madame,--[Madame, here, the wife of Monsieur le Comte de\r\nProvence.]--Madame Elisabeth, and Madame de Tourzel, were in the carriage;\r\nthe Princesse de Chimay and the ladies of the bedchamber for the week, the\r\nKing’s suite and servants, followed in Court carriages; a hundred deputies\r\nin carriages, and the bulk of the Parisian army, closed the procession.\r\n\r\nThe poissardes went before and around the carriage of their Majesties,\r\nCrying, “We shall no longer want bread!  We have the baker, the baker’s\r\nwife, and the baker’s boy with us!”  In the midst of this troop of\r\ncannibals the heads of two murdered Body Guards were carried on poles. The\r\nmonsters, who made trophies of them, conceived the horrid idea of forcing\r\na wigmaker of Sevres to dress them up and powder their bloody locks.  The\r\nunfortunate man who was forced to perform this dreadful work died in\r\nconsequence of the shock it gave him.\r\n\r\n[The King did not leave Versailles till one o’clock.  The Queen, the\r\nDauphin, Madame Royale, Monsieur, Madame Elisabeth, and Madame de Tourzel\r\nwere in his Majesty’s carriage.  The hundred deputies in their carriages\r\ncame next.  A detachment of brigands, bearing the heads of the two Body\r\nGuards in triumph, formed the advance guard, and set out two hours\r\nearlier.  These cannibals stopped a moment at Sevres, and carried their\r\ncruelty to the length of forcing an unfortunate hairdresser to dress the\r\ngory heads; the bulk of the Parisian army followed them closely.  The\r\nKing’s carriage was preceded by the ‘poissardes’, who had arrived the day\r\nbefore from Paris, and a rabble of prostitutes, the vile refuse of their\r\nsex, still drunk with fury and wine.  Several of them rode astride upon\r\ncannons, boasting, in the most horrible songs, of the crimes they had\r\ncommitted themselves, or seen others commit.  Those who were nearest the\r\nKing’s carriage sang ballads, the allusions in which by means of their\r\nvulgar gestures they applied to the Queen.  Wagons, full of corn and\r\nflour,--which had been brought into Versailles, formed a train escorted by\r\ngrenadiers, and surrounded by women and bullies, some armed with pikes,\r\nand some carrying long branches of poplar.  At some distance this part of\r\nthe procession had a most singular effect: it looked like a moving forest,\r\namidst which shone pike-heads and gun-barrels.  In the paroxysms of their\r\nbrutal joy the women stopped passengers, and, pointing to the King’s\r\ncarriage, howled in their ears: “Cheer up, friends; we shall no longer be\r\nin want of bread!  We bring you the baker, the baker’s wife, and the\r\nbaker’s little boy!”  Behind his Majesty’s carriage were several of his\r\nfaithful Guards, some on foot, and some on horseback, most of them\r\nuncovered, all unarmed, and worn out with hunger and fatigue; the\r\ndragoons, the Flanders regiment, the hundred Swiss, and the National\r\nGuards preceded, accompanied, or followed the file of carriages.  I\r\nwitnessed this heartrending spectacle; I saw the ominous procession.  In\r\nthe midst of all the tumult, clamour, and singing, interrupted by frequent\r\ndischarges of musketry, which the hand of a monster or a bungler might so\r\neasily render fatal, I saw the Queen preserving most courageous\r\ntranquillity of soul, and an air of nobleness and inexpressible dignity,\r\nand my eyes were suffused with tears of admiration and grief.--“Memoirs of\r\nBertrand de Molleville.”]\r\n\r\nThe progress of the procession was so slow that it was near six in the\r\nevening when this august family, made prisoners by their own people,\r\narrived at the Hotel de Ville.  Bailly received them there; they were\r\nplaced upon a throne, just when that of their ancestors had been\r\noverthrown.  The King spoke in a firm yet gracious manner; he said that he\r\nalways came with pleasure and confidence among the inhabitants of his good\r\ncity of Paris.  M. Bailly repeated this observation to the representatives\r\nof the commune, who came to address the King; but he forgot the word\r\nconfidence.  The Queen instantly and loudly reminded him of the omission.\r\nThe King and Queen, their children, and Madame Elisabeth, retired to the\r\nTuileries.  Nothing was ready for their reception there.  All the\r\nliving-rooms had been long given up to persons belonging to the Court;\r\nthey hastily quitted them on that day, leaving their furniture, which was\r\npurchased by the Court.  The Comtesse de la Marck, sister to the Marechaux\r\nde Noailles and de Mouchy, had occupied the apartments now appropriated to\r\nthe Queen.  Monsieur and Madame retired to the Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nThe Queen had sent for me on the morning of the 6th of October, to leave\r\nme and my father-in-law in charge of her most valuable property.  She took\r\naway only her casket of diamonds.  Comte Gouvernet de la Tour-du-Pin, to\r\nwhom the military government of Versailles was entrusted ‘pro tempore’,\r\ncame and gave orders to the National Guard, which had taken possession of\r\nthe apartments, to allow us to remove everything that we should deem\r\nnecessary for the Queen’s accommodation.\r\n\r\nI saw her Majesty alone in her private apartments a moment before her\r\ndeparture for Paris; she could hardly speak; tears bedewed her face, to\r\nwhich all the blood in her body seemed to have rushed; she condescended to\r\nembrace me, gave her hand to M. Campan to kiss, and said to us, “Come\r\nimmediately and settle at Paris; I will lodge you at the Tuileries; come,\r\nand do not leave me henceforward; faithful servants at moments like these\r\nbecome useful friends; we are lost, dragged away, perhaps to death; when\r\nkings become prisoners they are very near it.”\r\n\r\nI had frequent opportunities during the course of our misfortunes of\r\nobserving that the people never entirely give their allegiance to factious\r\nleaders, but easily escape their control when some cause reminds them of\r\ntheir duty.  As soon as the most violent Jacobins had an opportunity of\r\nseeing the Queen near at hand, of speaking to her, and of hearing her\r\nvoice, they became her most zealous partisans; and even when she was in\r\nthe prison of the Temple several of those who had contributed to place her\r\nthere perished for having attempted to get her out again.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 7th of October the same women who the day before\r\nsurrounded the carriage of the august prisoners, riding on cannons and\r\nuttering the most abusive language, assembled under the Queen’s windows,\r\nupon the terrace of the Chateau, and desired to see her.  Her Majesty\r\nappeared.  There are always among mobs of this description orators, that\r\nis to say, beings who have more assurance than the rest; a woman of this\r\ndescription told the Queen that she must now remove far from her all such\r\ncourtiers as ruin kings, and that she must love the inhabitants of her\r\ngood city.  The Queen answered that she had loved them at Versailles, and\r\nwould likewise love them at Paris.  “Yes, yes,” said another; “but on the\r\n14th of July you wanted to besiege the city and have it bombarded; and on\r\nthe 6th of October you wanted to fly to the frontiers.”  The Queen\r\nreplied, affably, that they had been told so, and had believed it; that\r\nthere lay the cause of the unhappiness of the people and of the best of\r\nkings.  A third addressed a few words to her in German: the Queen told her\r\nshe did not understand it; that she had become so entirely French as even\r\nto have forgotten her mother tongue.  This declaration was answered with\r\n“Bravo!” and clapping of hands; they then desired her to make a compact\r\nwith them.  “Ah,” said she, “how can I make a compact with you, since you\r\nhave no faith in that which my duty points out to me, and which I ought\r\nfor my own happiness to respect?”  They asked her for the ribbons and\r\nflowers out of her hat; her Majesty herself unfastened them and gave them;\r\nthey were divided among the party, which for above half an hour cried out,\r\nwithout ceasing, “Marie Antoinette for ever!  Our good Queen for ever!”\r\n\r\nTwo days after the King’s arrival at Paris, the city and the National\r\nGuard sent to request the Queen to appear at the theatre, and prove by her\r\npresence and the King’s that it was with pleasure they resided in their\r\ncapital.  I introduced the deputation which came to make this request.\r\nHer Majesty replied that she should have infinite pleasure in acceding to\r\nthe invitation of the city of Paris; but that time must be allowed her to\r\nsoften the recollection of the distressing events which had just occurred,\r\nand from which she had suffered too much.  She added, that having come\r\ninto Paris preceded by the heads of the faithful Guards who had perished\r\nbefore the door of their sovereign, she could not think that such an entry\r\ninto the capital ought to be followed by rejoicings; but that the\r\nhappiness she had always felt in appearing in the midst of the inhabitants\r\nof Paris was not effaced from her memory, and that she should enjoy it\r\nagain as soon as she found herself able to do so.\r\n\r\nTheir Majesties found some consolation in their private life: from\r\nMadame’s--[Madame, here, the Princesse Marie Therese, daughter of Marie\r\nAntoinette.]--gentle manners and filial affection, from the\r\naccomplishments and vivacity of the little Dauphin, and the attention and\r\ntenderness of the pious Princess Elisabeth, they still derived moments of\r\nhappiness.  The young Prince daily gave proofs of sensibility and\r\npenetration; he was not yet beyond female care, but a private tutor, the\r\nAbbe Davout, gave him all the instruction suitable to his age; his memory\r\nwas highly cultivated, and he recited verses with much grace and feeling.\r\n\r\n[On the 19th of October, that is to say, thirteen days after he had taken\r\nup his abode at Paris, the King went, on foot and almost alone, to review\r\nsome detachments of the National Guard.  After the review Louis XVI. met\r\nwith a child sweeping the street, who asked him for money.  The child\r\ncalled the King “M. le Chevalier.”  His Majesty gave him six francs.  The\r\nlittle sweeper, surprised at receiving so large a sum, cried out, “Oh! I\r\nhave no change; you will give me money another time.”  A person who\r\naccompanied the monarch said to the child, “Keep it all, my friend; the\r\ngentleman is not chevalier, he is the eldest of the family.”--NOTE BY THE\r\nEDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThe day after the arrival of the Court at Paris, terrified at hearing some\r\nnoise in the gardens of the Tuileries, the young prince threw himself into\r\nthe arms of the Queen, crying out, “Grand-Dieu, mamma! will it be\r\nyesterday over again?”  A few days after this affecting exclamation, he\r\nwent up to the King, and looked at him with a pensive air.  The King asked\r\nhim what he wanted; he answered, that he had something very serious to say\r\nto him.  The King having prevailed on him to explain himself, the young\r\nPrince asked why his people, who formerly loved him so well, were all at\r\nonce angry with him; and what he had done to irritate them so much.  His\r\nfather took him upon his knees, and spoke to him nearly as follows: “I\r\nwished, child, to render the people still happier than they were; I wanted\r\nmoney to pay the expenses occasioned by wars.  I asked my people for\r\nmoney, as my predecessors have always done; magistrates, composing the\r\nParliament, opposed it, and said that my people alone had a right to\r\nconsent to it.  I assembled the principal inhabitants of every town,\r\nwhether distinguished by birth, fortune, or talents, at Versailles; that\r\nis what is called the States General.  When they were assembled they\r\nrequired concessions of me which I could not make, either with due respect\r\nfor myself or with justice to you, who will be my successor; wicked men\r\ninducing the people to rise have occasioned the excesses of the last few\r\ndays; the people must not be blamed for them.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen made the young Prince clearly comprehend that he ought to treat\r\nthe commanders of battalions, the officers of the National Guard, and all\r\nthe Parisians who were about him, with affability; the child took great\r\npains to please all those people, and when he had had an opportunity of\r\nreplying obligingly to the mayor or members of the commune he came and\r\nwhispered in his mother’s ear, “Was that right?”\r\n\r\nHe requested M. Bailly to show him the shield of Scipio, which is in the\r\nroyal library; and M. Bailly asking him which he preferred, Scipio or\r\nHannibal, the young Prince replied, without hesitation, that he preferred\r\nhim who had defended his own country.  He gave frequent proofs of ready\r\nwit.  One day, while the Queen was hearing Madame repeat her exercises in\r\nancient history, the young Princess could not at the moment recollect the\r\nname of the Queen of Carthage; the Dauphin was vexed at his sister’s want\r\nof memory, and though he never spoke to her in the second person singular,\r\nhe bethought himself of the expedient of saying to her, “But ‘dis donc’\r\nthe name of the Queen, to mamma; ‘dis donc’ what her name was.”\r\n\r\nShortly after the arrival of the King and his family at Paris the Duchesse\r\nde Luynes came, in pursuance of the advice of a committee of the\r\nConstitutional Assembly, to propose to the Queen a temporary retirement\r\nfrom France, in order to leave the constitution to perfect itself, so that\r\nthe patriots should not accuse her of influencing the King to oppose it.\r\nThe Duchess knew how far the schemes of the conspirers extended, and her\r\nattachment to the Queen was the principal cause of the advice she gave\r\nher.  The Queen perfectly comprehended the Duchesse de Luynes’s motive;\r\nbut replied that she would never leave either the King or her son; that if\r\nshe thought herself alone obnoxious to public hatred she would instantly\r\noffer her life as a sacrifice;--but that it was the throne which was aimed\r\nat, and that, in abandoning the King, she should be merely committing an\r\nact of cowardice, since she saw no other advantage in it than that of\r\nsaving her own life.\r\n\r\nOne evening, in the month of November, 1790, I returned home rather late;\r\nI there found the Prince de Poix; he told me he came to request me to\r\nassist him in regaining his peace of mind; that at the commencement of the\r\nsittings of the National Assembly he had suffered himself to be seduced\r\ninto the hope of a better order of things; that he blushed for his error,\r\nand that he abhorred plans which had already produced such fatal results;\r\nthat he broke with the reformers for the rest of his life; that he had\r\ngiven in his resignation as a deputy of the National Assembly; and,\r\nfinally, that he was anxious that the Queen should not sleep in ignorance\r\nof his sentiments.  I undertook his commission, and acquitted myself of it\r\nin the best way I could; but I was totally unsuccessful.  The Prince de\r\nPoix remained at Court; he there suffered many mortifications, never\r\nceasing to serve the King in the most dangerous commissions with that zeal\r\nfor which his house has always been distinguished.\r\n\r\nWhen the King, the Queen, and the children were suitably established at\r\nthe Tuileries, as well as Madame Elisabeth and the Princesse de Lamballe,\r\nthe Queen resumed her usual habits; she employed her mornings in\r\nsuperintending the education of Madame, who received all her lessons in\r\nher presence, and she herself began to work large pieces of tapestry. Her\r\nmind was too much occupied with passing events and surrounding dangers to\r\nadmit her of applying herself to reading; the needle was the only\r\nemployment which could divert her.\r\n\r\n[There was long preserved at Paris, in the house of Mademoiselle\r\nDubuquois, a tapestry-worker, a carpet worked by the Queen and Madame\r\nElisabeth for the large room of her Majesty’s ground-floor apartments at\r\nthe Tuileries.  The Empress Josephine saw and admired this carpet, and\r\ndesired it might be taken care of, in the hope of one day sending it to\r\nMadame--MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nShe received the Court twice a week before going to mass, and on those\r\ndays dined in public with the King; she spent the rest of the time with\r\nher family and children; she had no concert, and did not go to the play\r\nuntil 1791, after the acceptation of the constitution.  The Princesse de\r\nLamballe, however, had some evening parties in her apartments at the\r\nTuileries, which were tolerably brilliant in consequence of the great\r\nnumber of persons who attended them.  The Queen was present at a few of\r\nthese assemblies; but being soon convinced that her present situation\r\nforbade her appearing much in public, she remained at home, and conversed\r\nas she sat at work.  The sole topic of her discourse was, as may well be\r\nsupposed, the Revolution.  She sought to discover the real opinions of the\r\nParisians respecting her, and how she could have so completely lost the\r\naffections of the people, and even of many persons in the higher ranks.\r\nShe well knew that she ought to impute the whole to the spirit of party,\r\nto the hatred of the Duc d’Orleans, and the folly of the French, who\r\ndesired to have a total change in the constitution; but she was not the\r\nless desirous of ascertaining the private feelings of all the people in\r\npower.\r\n\r\nFrom the very commencement of the Revolution General Luckner indulged in\r\nviolent sallies against her.  Her Majesty, knowing that I was acquainted\r\nwith a lady who had been long connected with the General, desired me to\r\ndiscover through that channel what was the private motive on which\r\nLuckner’s hatred against her was founded.  On being questioned upon this\r\npoint, he answered that Marechal de Segur had assured him he had proposed\r\nhim for the command of a camp of observation, but that the Queen had made\r\na bar against his name; and that this ‘par’, as he called it, in his\r\nGerman accent, he could not forget.\r\n\r\nThe Queen ordered me to repeat this reply to the King myself, and said to\r\nhim: “See, Sire, whether I was not right in telling you that your\r\nministers, in order to give themselves full scope in the distribution of\r\nfavours, persuaded the French that I interfered in everything; there was\r\nnot a single license given out in the country for the sale of salt or\r\ntobacco but the people believed it was given to one of my favourites.”\r\n\r\n“That is very, true,” replied the King; “but I find it very difficult to\r\nbelieve that Marechal de Segur ever said any such thing to Luckner; he\r\nknew too well that you never interfered in the distribution of favours.\r\n\r\n“That Luckner is a good-for-nothing fellow, and Segur is a brave and\r\nhonourable man who never uttered such a falsehood; however, you are right;\r\nand because you provided for a few dependents, you are most unjustly\r\nreported to have disposed of all offices, civil and military.”\r\n\r\nAll the nobility who had not left Paris made a point of presenting\r\nthemselves assiduously to the King, and there was a considerable influx to\r\nthe Tuileries.  Marks of attachment were exhibited even in external\r\nsymbols; the women wore enormous bouquets of lilies in their bosoms and\r\nupon their heads, and sometimes even bunches of white ribbon.  At the play\r\nthere were often disputes between the pit and the boxes about removing\r\nthese ornaments, which the people thought dangerous emblems. National\r\ncockades were sold in every corner of Paris; the sentinels stopped all who\r\ndid not wear them; the young men piqued themselves upon breaking through\r\nthis regulation, which was in some degree sanctioned by the acquiescence\r\nof Louis XVI.  Frays took place, which were to be regretted, because they\r\nexcited a spirit of lawlessness.  The King adopted conciliatory measures\r\nwith the Assembly in order to promote tranquillity; the revolutionists\r\nwere but little disposed to think him sincere; unfortunately the royalists\r\nencouraged this incredulity by incessantly repeating that the King was not\r\nfree, and that all that he did was completely null, and in no way bound\r\nhim for the time to come. Such was the heat and violence of party spirit\r\nthat persons the most sincerely attached to the King were not even\r\npermitted to use the language of reason, and recommend greater reserve in\r\nconversation. People would talk and argue at table without considering\r\nthat all the servants belonged to the hostile army; and it may truly be\r\nsaid there was as much imprudence and levity in the party assailed as\r\nthere was cunning, boldness, and perseverance in that which made the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February, 1790, another matter gave the Court much uneasiness; a\r\nzealous individual of the name of Favras had conceived the scheme of\r\ncarrying off the King, and affecting a counter-revolution.  Monsieur,\r\nprobably out of mere benevolence, gave him some money, and thence arose a\r\nreport that he thereby wished to favour the execution of the enterprise.\r\nThe step taken by Monsieur in going to the Hotel de Ville to explain\r\nhimself on this matter was unknown to the Queen; it is more than probable\r\nthat the King was acquainted with it.  When judgment was pronounced upon\r\nM. de Favras the Queen did not conceal from me her fears about the\r\nconfessions of the unfortunate man in his last moments.\r\n\r\nI sent a confidential person to the Hotel de Ville; she came to inform the\r\nQueen that the condemned had demanded to be taken from Notre-Dame to the\r\nHotel de Ville to make a final declaration, and give some particulars\r\nverifying it.  These particulars compromised nobody; Favras corrected his\r\nlast will after writing it, and went to the scaffold with heroic courage\r\nand coolness.  The judge who read his condemnation to him told him that\r\nhis life was a sacrifice which he owed to public tranquillity.  It was\r\nasserted at the time that Favras was given up as a victim in order to\r\nsatisfy the people and save the Baron de Besenval, who was a prisoner in\r\nthe Abbaye.\r\n\r\n[Thomas Mahy, Marquis de Favras, was accused in the month of December,\r\n1789, of having conspired against the Revolution.  Having been arrested by\r\norder of the committee of inquiry of the National Assembly, he was\r\ntransferred to the Chatelet, where he defended himself with much coolness\r\nand presence of mind, repelling the accusations brought against him by\r\nMorel, Turcati, and Marquis, with considerable force.  These witnesses\r\ndeclared he had imparted his plan to them; it was to be carried into\r\nexecution by 12,000 Swiss and 12,000 Germans, who were to be assembled at\r\nMontargis, thence to march upon Paris, carry off the King, and assassinate\r\nBailly, La Fayette, and Necker.  The greater number of these charges he\r\ndenied, and declared that the rest related only to the levy of a troop\r\nintended to favour the revolution preparing in Brabant.  The judge having\r\nrefused to disclose who had denounced him, he complained to the Assembly,\r\nwhich passed to the order of the day.  His death was obviously inevitable.\r\nDuring the whole time of the proceedings the populace never ceased\r\nthreatening the judges and shouting, “A la lanterne!”  It was even\r\nnecessary to keep numerous troops and artillery constantly ready to act in\r\nthe courtyard of the Chatelet. The judges, who had just acquitted M. de\r\nBesenval in an affair nearly similar, doubtless dreaded the effects of\r\nthis fury.  When they refused to hear Favras’s witnesses in exculpation,\r\nhe compared them to the tribunal of the Inquisition.  The principal charge\r\nagainst him was founded on a letter from M. de Foucault, asking him,\r\n“where are your troops?  in which direction will they enter Paris? I\r\nshould like to be employed among them.”  Favras was condemned to make the\r\n‘amende honorable’ in front of the Cathedral, and to be hanged at the\r\nPlace de Greve.  He heard this sentence with wonderful calmness, and said\r\nto his judges, “I pity you much if the testimony of two men is sufficient\r\nto induce you to condemn.”  The judge having said to him, “I have no other\r\nconsolation to hold out to you than that which religion affords,” he\r\nreplied, nobly, “My greatest consolation is that which I derive from my\r\ninnocence.”--“Biographic Universelle”]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the Sunday following this execution M. de la Villeurnoy\r\ncame to my house to tell me that he was going that day to the public\r\ndinner of the King and Queen to present Madame de Favras and her son, both\r\nof them in mourning for the brave Frenchman who fell a sacrifice for his\r\nKing; and that all the royalists expected to see the Queen load the\r\nunfortunate family with favours.  I did all that lay in my power to\r\nprevent this proceeding.  I foresaw the effect it would have upon the\r\nQueen’s feeling heart, and the painful constraint she would experience,\r\nhaving the horrible Santerre, the commandant of a battalion of the\r\nParisian guard, behind her chair during dinner-time.  I could not make M.\r\nde la Villeurnoy comprehend my argument; the Queen was gone to mass,\r\nsurrounded by her whole Court, and I had not even means of apprising her\r\nof his intention.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was over I heard a knocking at the door of my apartment, which\r\nopened into the corridor next that of the Queen; it was herself. She asked\r\nme whether there was anybody with me; I was alone; she threw herself into\r\nan armchair, and told me she came to weep with me over the foolish conduct\r\nof the ultras of the King’s party.  “We must fall,” said she, “attacked as\r\nwe are by men who possess every talent and shrink from no crime, while we\r\nare defended only by those who are no doubt very estimable, but have no\r\nadequate idea of our situation.  They have exposed me to the animosity of\r\nboth parties by presenting the widow and son of Favras to me.  Were I free\r\nto act as I wish, I should take the child of the man who has just\r\nsacrificed himself for us and place him at table between the King and\r\nmyself; but surrounded by the assassins who have destroyed his father, I\r\ndid not dare even to cast my eyes upon him.  The royalists will blame me\r\nfor not having appeared interested in this poor child; the revolutionists\r\nwill be enraged at the idea that his presentation should have been thought\r\nagreeable to me.”  However, the Queen added that she knew Madame de Favras\r\nwas in want, and that she desired me to send her next day, through a\r\nperson who could be relied on, a few rouleaus of fifty Louis, and to\r\ndirect that she should be assured her Majesty would always watch over the\r\nfortunes of herself and her son.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March following I had an opportunity of ascertaining the\r\nKing’s sentiments respecting the schemes which were continually proposed\r\nto him for making his escape.  One night about ten o’clock Comte\r\nd’Inisdal, who was deputed by the nobility, came to request that I would\r\nsee him in private, as he had an important matter to communicate to me. He\r\ntold me that on that very night the King was to be carried off; that the\r\nsection of the National Guard, that day commanded by M. d’Aumont, was\r\ngained over, and that sets of horses, furnished by some good royalists,\r\nwere placed in relays at suitable distances; that he had just left a\r\nnumber of the nobility assembled for the execution of this scheme, and\r\nthat he had been sent to me that I might, through the medium of the Queen,\r\nobtain the King’s positive consent to it before midnight; that the King\r\nwas aware of their plan, but that his Majesty never would speak decidedly,\r\nand that it was necessary he should consent to the undertaking.  I greatly\r\ndispleased Comte d’Inisdal by expressing my astonishment that the nobility\r\nat the moment of the execution of so important a project should send to\r\nme, the Queen’s first woman, to obtain a consent which ought to have been\r\nthe basis of any well-concerted scheme.  I told him, also, that it would\r\nbe impossible for me to go at that time to the Queen’s apartments without\r\nexciting the attention of the people in the antechambers; that the King\r\nwas at cards with the Queen and his family, and that I never broke in upon\r\ntheir privacy unless I was called for.  I added, however, that M. Campan\r\ncould enter without being called; and if the Count chose to give him his\r\nconfidence he might rely upon him.\r\n\r\nMy father-in-law, to whom Comte d’Inisdal repeated what he had said to me,\r\ntook the commission upon himself, and went to the Queen’s apartments. The\r\nKing was playing at whist with the Queen, Monsieur, and Madame; Madame\r\nElisabeth was kneeling on a stool near the table.  M. Campan informed the\r\nQueen of what had been communicated to me; nobody uttered a word.  The\r\nQueen broke silence and said to the King, “Do you hear, Sire, what Campan\r\nsays to us?”--“Yes, I hear,” said the King, and continued his game.\r\nMonsieur, who was in the habit of introducing passages from plays into his\r\nconversation, said to my father-in-law, “M. Campan, that pretty little\r\ncouplet again, if you please;” and pressed the King to reply.  At length\r\nthe Queen said, “But something must be said to Campan.”  The King then\r\nspoke to my father-in-law in these words: “Tell M. d’Inisdal that I cannot\r\nconsent to be carried off!”  The Queen enjoined M. Campan to take care\r\nand, report this answer faithfully.  “You understand,” added she, “the\r\nKing cannot consent to be carried off.”\r\n\r\nComte d’Inisdal was very much dissatisfied with the King’s answer, and\r\nwent out, saying, “I understand; he wishes to throw all the blame,\r\nbeforehand, upon those who are to devote themselves for him.”\r\n\r\nHe went away, and I thought the enterprise would be abandoned.  However,\r\nthe Queen remained alone with me till midnight, preparing her cases of\r\nvaluables, and ordered me not to go to bed.  She imagined the King’s\r\nanswer would be understood as a tacit consent, and merely a refusal to\r\nparticipate in the design.  I do not know what passed in the King’s\r\napartments during the night; but I occasionally looked out at the windows:\r\nI saw the garden clear; I heard no noise in the palace, and day at length\r\nconfirmed my opinion that the project had been given up.  “We must,\r\nhowever, fly,” said the Queen to me, shortly afterwards; “who knows how\r\nfar the factious may go?  The danger increases every day.”\r\n\r\n[The disturbances of the 13th of April, 1790, occasioned by the warmth of\r\nthe discussions upon Dom Gerle’s imprudent motion in the National\r\nAssembly, having afforded room for apprehension that the enemies of the\r\ncountry would endeavour to carry off the King from the capital, M. de La\r\nFayette promised to keep watch, and told Louis XVI. that if he saw any\r\nalarming movement among the disaffected he would give him notice of it by\r\nthe discharge of a cannon from Henri IV.’s battery on the Pont Neuf.  On\r\nthe same night a few casual discharges of musketry were heard from the\r\nterrace of the Tuileries. The King, deceived by the noise, flew to the\r\nQueen’s apartments; he did not find her; he ran to the Dauphin’s room,\r\nwhere he found the Queen holding her son in her arms. “Madame;” said the\r\nKing to her, “I have been seeking you; and you have made me uneasy.”  The\r\nQueen, showing her son, said to him, “I was at my post.”--“Anecdotes of\r\nthe Reign of Louis XVI.”]\r\n\r\nThis Princess received advice and memorials from all quarters.  Rivarol\r\naddressed several to her, which I read to her.  They were full of\r\ningenious observations; but the Queen did not find that they, contained\r\nanything of essential service under the circumstances in which the royal\r\nfamily was placed.  Comte du Moustier also sent memorials and plans of\r\nconduct.  I remember that in one of his writings he said to the King,\r\n“Read ‘Telemachus’ again, Sire; in that book which delighted your Majesty\r\nin infancy you will find the first seeds of those principles which,\r\nerroneously followed up by men of ardent imaginations, are bringing on the\r\nexplosion we expect every moment.”  I read so many of these memorials that\r\nI could hardly give a faithful account of them, and I am determined to\r\nnote in this work no other events than such as I witnessed; no other words\r\nthan such as (notwithstanding the lapse of time) still in some measure\r\nvibrate in my ears.\r\n\r\nComte de Segur, on his return from Russia, was employed some time by the\r\nQueen, and had a certain degree of influence over her; but that did not\r\nlast long.  Comte Augustus de la Marck likewise endeavoured to negotiate\r\nfor the King’s advantage with the leaders of the factious.  M. de\r\nFontanges, Archbishop of Toulouse, possessed also the Queen’s confidence;\r\nbut none of the endeavours which were made on the spot produced any,\r\nbeneficial result.  The Empress Catherine II. also conveyed her opinion\r\nupon the situation of Louis XVI. to the Queen, and her Majesty made me\r\nread a few lines in the Empress’s own handwriting, which concluded with\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n“Kings ought to proceed in their career undisturbed by the cries of the\r\npeople, even as the moon pursues her course unimpeded by the baying of\r\ndogs.”  This maxim of the despotic sovereign of Russia was very\r\ninapplicable to the situation of a captive king.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the revolutionary party followed up its audacious enterprise in\r\na determined manner, without meeting any opposition.  The advice from\r\nwithout, as well from Coblentz as from Vienna, made various impressions\r\nupon the members of the royal family, and those cabinets were not in\r\naccordance with each other.  I often had reason to infer from what the\r\nQueen said to me that she thought the King, by leaving all the honour of\r\nrestoring order to the Coblentz party,--[The Princes and the chief of the\r\nemigrant nobility assembled at Coblentz, and the name was used to\r\ndesignate the reactionary party.]--would, on the return of the emigrants,\r\nbe put under a kind of guardianship which would increase his own\r\nmisfortunes.  She frequently said to me, “If the emigrants succeed, they\r\nwill rule the roast for a long time; it will be impossible to refuse them\r\nanything; to owe the crown to them would be contracting too great an\r\nobligation.”  It always appeared to me that she wished her own family to\r\ncounterbalance the claims of the emigrants by disinterested services. She\r\nwas fearful of M. de Calonne, and with good reason.  She had proof that\r\nthis minister was her bitterest enemy, and that he made use of the most\r\ncriminal means in order to blacken her reputation.  I can testify that I\r\nhave seen in the hands of the Queen a manuscript copy of the infamous\r\nmemoirs of the woman De Lamotte, which had been brought to her from\r\nLondon, and in which all those passages where a total ignorance of the\r\ncustoms of Courts had occasioned that wretched woman to make blunders\r\nwhich would have been too palpable were corrected in M. de Calonne’s own\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\nThe two King’s Guards who were wounded at her Majesty’s door on the 6th of\r\nOctober were M. du Repaire and M. de Miomandre de Sainte-Marie; on the\r\ndreadful night of the 6th of October the latter took the post of the\r\nformer the moment he became incapable of maintaining it.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of the Body Guards, who were wounded on the 6th of\r\nOctober, betook themselves to the infirmary at Versailles.  The brigands\r\nwanted to make their way into the infirmary in order to massacre them. M.\r\nViosin, head surgeon of that infirmary, ran to the entrance hall, invited\r\nthe assailants to refresh themselves, ordered wine to be brought, and\r\nfound means to direct the Sister Superior to remove the Guards into a ward\r\nappropriated to the poor, and dress them in the caps and greatcoats\r\nfurnished by the institution.  The good sisters executed this order so\r\npromptly that the Guards were removed, dressed as paupers, and their beds\r\nmade, while the assassins were drinking.  They searched all the wards, and\r\nfancied they saw no persons there but the sick poor; thus the Guards were\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nM. de Miomandre was at Paris, living on terms of friendship with another\r\nof the Guards, who, on the same day, received a gunshot wound from the\r\nbrigands in another part of the Chateau.  These two officers, who were\r\nattended and cured together at the infirmary of Versailles, were almost\r\nconstant companions; they were recognised at the Palais Royal, and\r\ninsulted.  The Queen thought it necessary for them to quit Paris.  She\r\ndesired me to write to M. de Miomandre de Sainte-Marie, and tell him to\r\ncome to me at eight o’clock in the evening; and then to communicate to him\r\nher wish to hear of his being in safety; and ordered me, when he had made\r\nup his mind to go, to tell him in her name that gold could not repay such\r\na service as he had rendered; that she hoped some day to be in\r\nsufficiently happy circumstances to recompense him as she ought; but that\r\nfor the present her offer of money was only that of a sister to a brother\r\nsituated as he then was, and that she requested he would take whatever\r\nmight be necessary to discharge his debts at Paris and defray the expenses\r\nof his journey.  She told me also to desire he would bring his friend\r\nBertrand with him, and to make him the same offer.\r\n\r\nThe two Guards came at the appointed hour, and accepted, I think, each one\r\nor two hundred louis.  A moment afterwards the Queen opened my door; she\r\nwas accompanied by the King and Madame Elisabeth; the King stood with his\r\nback against the fireplace; the Queen sat down upon a sofa and Madame\r\nElisabeth sat near her; I placed myself behind the Queen, and the two\r\nGuards stood facing the King.  The Queen told them that the King wished to\r\nsee before they went away two of the brave men who had afforded him the\r\nstrongest proofs of courage and attachment.  Miomandre said all that the\r\nQueen’s affecting observations were calculated to inspire.  Madame\r\nElisabeth spoke of the King’s gratitude; the Queen resumed the subject of\r\ntheir speedy departure, urging the necessity of it; the King was silent;\r\nbut his emotion was evident, and his eyes were suffused with tears.  The\r\nQueen rose, the King went out, and Madame Elisabeth followed him; the\r\nQueen stopped and said to me, in the recess of a window, “I am sorry I\r\nbrought the King here!  I am sure Elisabeth thinks with me; if the King\r\nhad but given utterance to a fourth part of what he thinks of those brave\r\nmen they would have been in ecstacies; but he cannot overcome his\r\ndiffidence.”\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Joseph died about this time.  The Queen’s grief was not\r\nexcessive; that brother of whom she had been so proud, and whom she had\r\nloved so tenderly, had probably suffered greatly in her opinion; she\r\nreproached him sometimes, though with moderation, for having adopted\r\nseveral of the principles of the new philosophy, and perhaps she knew that\r\nhe looked upon our troubles with the eye of the sovereign of Germany\r\nrather than that of the brother of the Queen of France.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor on one occasion sent the Queen an engraving which represented\r\nunfrocked nuns and monks.  The first were trying on fashionable dresses,\r\nthe latter were having their hair arranged; the picture was always left in\r\nthe closet, and never hung up.  The Queen told me to have it taken away;\r\nfor she was hurt to see how much influence the philosophers had over her\r\nbrother’s mind and actions.\r\n\r\nMirabeau had not lost the hope of becoming the last resource of the\r\noppressed Court; and at this time some communications passed between the\r\nQueen and him.  The question was about an office to be conferred upon him.\r\nThis transpired, and it must have been about this period that the Assembly\r\ndecreed that no deputy could hold an office as a minister of the King\r\nuntil the expiration of two years after the cessation of his legislative\r\nfunctions.  I know that the Queen was much hurt at this decision, and\r\nconsidered that the Court had lost a promising opening.\r\n\r\nThe palace of the Tuileries was a very disagreeable residence during the\r\nsummer, which made the Queen wish to go to St. Cloud.  The removal was\r\ndecided on without any opposition; the National Guard of Paris followed\r\nthe Court thither.  At this period new opportunities of escape were\r\npresented; nothing would have been more easy than to execute them.  The\r\nKing had obtained leave (!) to go out without guards, and to be\r\naccompanied only by an aide-de-camp of M. de La Fayette.  The Queen also\r\nhad one on duty with her, and so had the Dauphin.  The King and Queen\r\noften went out at four in the afternoon, and did not return until eight or\r\nnine.\r\n\r\nI will relate one of the plans of emigration which the Queen communicated\r\nto me, the success of which seemed infallible.  The royal family were to\r\nmeet in a wood four leagues from St. Cloud; some persons who could be\r\nfully relied on were to accompany the King, who was always followed by his\r\nequerries and pages; the Queen was to join him with her daughter and\r\nMadame Elisabeth.  These Princesses, as well as the Queen, had equerries\r\nand pages, of whose fidelity no doubt could be entertained.  The Dauphin\r\nlikewise was to be at the place of rendezvous with Madame de Tourzel; a\r\nlarge berlin and a chaise for the attendants were sufficient for the whole\r\nfamily; the aides-de-camp were to have been gained over or mastered.  The\r\nKing was to leave a letter for the President of the National Assembly on\r\nhis bureau at St. Cloud.  The people in the service of the King and Queen\r\nwould have waited until nine in the evening without anxiety, because the\r\nfamily sometimes did not return until that hour. The letter could not be\r\nforwarded to Paris until ten o’clock at the earliest.  The Assembly would\r\nnot then be sitting; the President must have been sought for at his own\r\nhouse or elsewhere; it would have been midnight before the Assembly could\r\nhave been summoned and couriers sent off to have the royal family stopped;\r\nbut the latter would have been six or seven hours in advance, as they\r\nwould have started at six leagues’ distance from Paris; and at this period\r\ntravelling was not yet impeded in France.\r\n\r\nThe Queen approved of this plan; but I did not venture to interrogate her,\r\nand I even thought if it were put in execution she would leave me in\r\nignorance of it.  One evening in the month of June the people of the\r\nChateau, finding the King did not return by nine o’clock, were walking\r\nabout the courtyards in a state of great anxiety.  I thought the family,\r\nwas gone, and I could scarcely breathe amidst the confusion of my good\r\nwishes, when I heard the sound of the carriages.  I confessed to the Queen\r\nthat I thought she had set off; she told me she must wait until Mesdames\r\nthe King’s aunts had quitted France, and afterwards see whether the plan\r\nagreed with those formed abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a meeting at Paris for the first federation on the 14th of July,\r\n1790, the anniversary of the taking of the Bastille.  What an astonishing\r\nassemblage of four hundred thousand men, of whom there were not perhaps\r\ntwo hundred who did not believe that the King found happiness and glory in\r\nthe order of things then being established.  The love which was borne him\r\nby all, with the exception of those who meditated his ruin, still reigned\r\nin the hearts of the French in the departments; but if I may judge from\r\nthose whom I had an opportunity of seeing, it was totally impossible to\r\nenlighten them; they were as much attached to the King as to the\r\nconstitution, and to the constitution as to the King; and it was\r\nimpossible to separate the one from the other in their hearts and minds.\r\n\r\nThe Court returned to St. Cloud after the federation.  A wretch, named\r\nRotondo, made his way into the palace with the intention of assassinating\r\nthe Queen.  It is known that he penetrated to the inner gardens: the rain\r\nprevented her Majesty from going out that day.  M. de La Fayette, who was\r\naware of this plot, gave all the sentinels the strictest orders, and a\r\ndescription of the monster was distributed throughout the palace by order\r\nof the General.  I do not know how he was saved from punishment. The\r\npolice belonging to the King discovered that there was likewise a scheme\r\non foot for poisoning the Queen.  She spoke to me, as well as to her head\r\nphysician, M. Vicq-d’Azyr, about it, without the slightest emotion, but\r\nboth he and I consulted what precautions it would be proper to take.  He\r\nrelied much upon the Queen’s temperance; yet he recommended me always to\r\nhave a bottle of oil of sweet almonds within reach, and to renew it\r\noccasionally, that oil and milk being, as is known, the most certain\r\nantidotes to the divellication of corrosive poisons.\r\n\r\nThe Queen had a habit which rendered M. Vicq-d’Azyr particularly uneasy:\r\nthere was always some pounded sugar upon the table in her Majesty’s\r\nbedchamber; and she frequently, without calling anybody, put spoonfuls of\r\nit into a glass of water when she wished to drink.  It was agreed that I\r\nshould get a considerable quantity of sugar powdered; that I should always\r\nhave some papers of it in my bag, and that three or four times a day, when\r\nalone in the Queen’s room, I should substitute it for that in her\r\nsugar-basin.  We knew that the Queen would have prevented all such\r\nprecautions, but we were not aware of her reason.  One day she caught me\r\nalone making this exchange, and told me, she supposed it was agreed on\r\nbetween myself and M. Vicq-d’Azyr, but that I gave myself very unnecessary\r\ntrouble.  “Remember,” added she, “that not a grain of poison will be put\r\nin use against me.  The Brinvilliers do not belong to this century: this\r\nage possesses calumny, which is a much more convenient instrument of\r\ndeath; and it is by that I shall perish.”\r\n\r\nEven while melancholy presentiments afflicted this unfortunate Princess,\r\nmanifestations of attachment to her person, and to the King’s cause, would\r\nfrequently raise agreeable illusions in her mind, or present to her the\r\naffecting spectacle of tears shed for her sorrows.  I was one day, during\r\nthis same visit to St. Cloud, witness of a very touching scene, which we\r\ntook great care to keep secret.  It was four in the afternoon; the guard\r\nwas not set; there was scarcely anybody at St. Cloud that day, and I was\r\nreading to the Queen, who was at work in a room the balcony of which hung\r\nover the courtyard.  The windows were closed, yet we heard a sort of\r\ninarticulate murmur from a great number of voices.  The Queen desired me\r\nto go and see what it was; I raised the muslin curtain, and perceived more\r\nthan fifty persons beneath the balcony: this group consisted of women,\r\nyoung and old, perfectly well dressed in the country costume, old\r\nchevaliers of St. Louis, young knights of Malta, and a few ecclesiastics.\r\nI told the Queen it was probably an assemblage of persons residing in the\r\nneighbourhood who wished to see her.  She rose, opened the window, and\r\nappeared in the balcony; immediately all these worthy people said to her,\r\nin an undertone: “Courage, Madame; good Frenchmen suffer for you, and with\r\nyou; they pray for you.  Heaven will hear their prayers; we love you, we\r\nrespect you, we will continue to venerate our virtuous King.”  The Queen\r\nburst into tears, and held her handkerchief to her eyes.  “Poor Queen! she\r\nweeps!”  said the women and young girls; but the dread of exposing her\r\nMajesty, and even the persons who showed so much affection for her, to\r\nobservation, prompted me to take her hand, and prevail upon her to retire\r\ninto her room; and, raising my eyes, I gave the excellent people to\r\nunderstand that my conduct was dictated by prudence.  They comprehended\r\nme, for I heard, “That lady is right;” and afterwards, “Farewell, Madame!”\r\n from several of them; and all this in accents of feeling so true and so\r\nmournful, that I am affected at the recollection of them even after a\r\nlapse of twenty years.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards the insurrection of Nancy took place.\r\n\r\n[The insurrection of the troops at Nancy broke out in August 1790, and was\r\nput down by Marechal de Bouille on the last day of that month.  See\r\n“Bouille,” p. 195.]\r\n\r\nOnly the ostensible cause is known; there was another, of which I might\r\nhave been in full possession, if the great confusion I was in upon the\r\nsubject had not deprived me of the power of paying attention to it.  I\r\nwill endeavour to make myself understood.  In the early part of September\r\nthe Queen, as she was going to bed, desired me to let all her people go,\r\nand to remain with her myself; when we were alone she said to me, “The\r\nKing will come here at midnight.  You know that he has always shown you\r\nmarks of distinction; he now proves his confidence in you by selecting you\r\nto write down the whole affair of Nancy from his dictation.  He must have\r\nseveral copies of it.”  At midnight the King came to the Queen’s\r\napartments, and said to me, smiling, “You did not expect to become my\r\nsecretary, and that, too, during the night.”  I followed the King into the\r\ncouncil chamber.  I found there sheets of paper, an inkstand, and pens all\r\nready prepared.  He sat down by my side and dictated to me the report of\r\nthe Marquis de Bouille, which he himself copied at the same time.  My hand\r\ntrembled; I wrote with difficulty; my reflections scarcely left me\r\nsufficient power of attention to listen to the King.  The large table, the\r\nvelvet cloth, seats which ought to have been filled by none but the King’s\r\nchief councillors; what that chamber had been, and what it was at that\r\nmoment, when the King was employing a woman in an office which had so\r\nlittle affinity with her ordinary functions; the misfortunes which had\r\nbrought him to the necessity of doing so,--all these ideas made such an\r\nimpression upon me that when I had returned to the Queen’s apartments I\r\ncould not sleep for the remainder of the night, nor could I remember what\r\nI had written.\r\n\r\nThe more I saw that I had the happiness to be of some use to my employers,\r\nthe more scrupulously careful was I to live entirely with my family; and I\r\nnever indulged in any conversation which could betray the intimacy to\r\nwhich I was admitted; but nothing at Court remains long concealed, and I\r\nsoon saw I had many enemies.  The means of injuring others in the minds of\r\nsovereigns are but too easily obtained, and they had become still more so,\r\nsince the mere suspicion of communication with partisans of the Revolution\r\nwas sufficient to forfeit the esteem and confidence of the King and Queen;\r\nhappily, my conduct protected me, with them, against calumny.  I had left\r\nSt. Cloud two days, when I received at Paris a note from the Queen,\r\ncontaining these words:\r\n\r\n“Come to St. Cloud immediately; I have something concerning you to\r\ncommunicate.”  I set off without loss of time.  Her Majesty told me she\r\nhad a sacrifice to request of me; I answered that it was made.  She said\r\nit went so far as the renunciation of a friend’s society; that such a\r\nrenunciation was always painful, but that it must be particularly so to\r\nme; that, for her own part, it might have been very useful that a deputy,\r\na man of talent, should be constantly received at my house; but at this\r\nmoment she thought only of my welfare.  The Queen then informed me that\r\nthe ladies of the bedchamber had, the preceding evening, assured her that\r\nM. de Beaumetz, deputy from the nobility of Artois, who had taken his seat\r\non the left of the Assembly, spent his whole time at my house. Perceiving\r\non what false grounds the attempt to injure, me was based, I replied\r\nrespectfully, but at the same time smiling, that it was impossible for me\r\nto make the sacrifice exacted by her Majesty; that M. de Beaumetz, a man\r\nof great judgment, had not determined to cross over to the left of the\r\nAssembly with the intention of afterwards making himself unpopular by\r\nspending his time with the Queen’s first woman; and that, ever since the\r\n1st of October, 1789, I had seen him nowhere but at the play, or in the\r\npublic walks, and even then without his ever coming to speak to me; that\r\nthis line of conduct had appeared to me perfectly consistent: for whether\r\nhe was desirous to please the popular party, or to be sought after by the\r\nCourt, he could not act in any other way towards me.  The Queen closed\r\nthis explanation by saying, “Oh! it is clear, as clear as the day! this\r\nopportunity for trying to do you an injury is very ill chosen; but be\r\ncautious in your slightest actions; you perceive that the confidence\r\nplaced in you by the King and myself raises you up powerful enemies.”\r\n\r\nThe private communications which were still kept up between the Court and\r\nMirabeau at length procured him an interview with the Queen, in the\r\ngardens of St. Cloud.  He left Paris on horseback, on pretence of going\r\ninto the country, to M. de Clavieres, one of his friends; but he stopped\r\nat one of the gates of the gardens of St.  Cloud, and was led to a spot\r\nsituated in the highest part of the private garden, where the Queen was\r\nwaiting for him.  She told me she accosted him by saying, “With a common\r\nenemy, with a man who had sworn to destroy monarchy without appreciating\r\nits utility among a great people, I should at this moment be guilty of a\r\nmost ill-advised step; but in speaking to a Mirabeau,” etc.  The poor\r\nQueen was delighted at having discovered this method of exalting him above\r\nall others of his principles; and in imparting the particulars of this\r\ninterview to me she said, “Do you know that those words, ‘a Mirabeau,’\r\nappeared to flatter him exceedingly.”  On leaving the Queen he said to her\r\nwith warmth, “Madame, the monarchy is saved!”  It must have been soon\r\nafterwards that Mirabeau received considerable sums of money.  He showed\r\nit too plainly by the increase of his expenditure. Already did some of his\r\nremarks upon the necessity of arresting the progress of the democrats\r\ncirculate in society.  Being once invited to meet a person at dinner who\r\nwas very much attached to the Queen, he learned that that person withdrew\r\non hearing that he was one of the guests; the party who invited him told\r\nhim this with some degree of satisfaction; but all were very much\r\nastonished when they heard Mirabeau eulogise the absent guest, and declare\r\nthat in his place he would have done the same; but, he added, they had\r\nonly to invite that person again in a few months, and he would then dine\r\nwith the restorer of the monarchy.  Mirabeau forgot that it was more easy\r\nto do harm than good, and thought himself the political Atlas of the whole\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOutrages and mockery were incessantly mingled with the audacious\r\nproceedings of the revolutionists.  It was customary to give serenades\r\nunder the King’s windows on New Year’s Day.  The band of the National\r\nGuard repaired thither on that festival in 1791; in allusion to the\r\nliquidation of the debts of the State, decreed by the Assembly, they\r\nplayed solely, and repeatedly, that air from the comic opera of the\r\n“Debts,” the burden of which is, “But our creditors are paid, and that\r\nmakes us easy.”\r\n\r\nOn the same day some “conquerors of the Bastille,” grenadiers of the\r\nParisian guard, preceded by military music, came to present to the young\r\nDauphin, as a New Year’s gift, a box of dominoes, made of some of the\r\nstone and marble of which that state prison was built.  The Queen gave me\r\nthis inauspicious curiosity, desiring me to preserve it, as it would be a\r\ncurious illustration of the history of the Revolution.  Upon the lid were\r\nengraved some bad verses, the purport of which was as follows: “Stones\r\nfrom those walls, which enclosed the innocent victims of arbitrary power,\r\nhave been converted into a toy, to be presented to you, Monseigneur, as a\r\nmark of the people’s love; and to teach you their power.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen said that M. de La Fayette’s thirst for popularity induced him\r\nto lend himself, without discrimination, to all popular follies.  Her\r\ndistrust of the General increased daily, and grew so powerful that when,\r\ntowards the end of the Revolution, he seemed willing to support the\r\ntottering throne, she could never bring herself to incur so great an\r\nobligation to him.\r\n\r\nM. de J-----, a colonel attached to the staff of the army, was fortunate\r\nenough to render several services to the Queen, and acquitted himself with\r\ndiscretion and dignity of various important missions.\r\n\r\n[During the Queen’s detention in the Temple he introduced himself Into\r\nthat prison in the dress of a lamplighter, and there discharged his duty\r\nunrecognised.--MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nTheir Majesties had the highest confidence in him, although it frequently\r\nhappened that his prudence, when inconsiderate projects were under\r\ndiscussion, brought upon him the charge of adopting the principles of the\r\nconstitutionals.  Being sent to Turin, he had some difficulty in\r\ndissuading the Princes from a scheme they had formed at that period of\r\nreentering France, with a very weak army, by way of Lyons; and when, in a\r\ncouncil which lasted till three o’clock in the morning, he showed his\r\ninstructions, and demonstrated that the measure would endanger the King,\r\nthe Comte d’Artois alone declared against the plan, which emanated from\r\nthe Prince de Conde.\r\n\r\nAmong the persons employed in subordinate situations, whom the critical\r\ncircumstances of the times involved in affairs of importance, was M. de\r\nGoguelat, a geographical engineer at Versailles, and an excellent\r\ndraughtsman.  He made plans of St. Cloud and Trianon for the Queen; she\r\nwas very much pleased with them, and had the engineer admitted into the\r\nstaff of the army.  At the commencement of the Revolution he was sent to\r\nCount Esterhazy, at Valenciennes, in the capacity of aide-de-camp.  The\r\nlatter rank was given him solely to get him away from Versailles, where\r\nhis rashness endangered the Queen during the earlier months of the\r\nAssembly of the States General.  Making a parade of his devotion to the\r\nKing’s interests, he went repeatedly to the tribunes of the Assembly, and\r\nthere openly railed at all the motions of the deputies, and then returned\r\nto the Queen’s antechamber, where he repeated all that he had just heard,\r\nor had had the imprudence to say.  Unfortunately, at the same time that\r\nthe Queen sent away M. de Goguelat, she still believed that, in a\r\ndangerous predicament, requiring great self-devotion, the man might be\r\nemployed advantageously.  In 1791 he was commissioned to act in concert\r\nwith the Marquis de Bouille in furtherance of the King’s intended escape.\r\n\r\n[See the “Memoirs” of M. de Bouille, those of the Duc de Choiseul, and the\r\naccount of the journey to Varennes, by M. de Fontanges, in “Weber’s\r\nMemoirs.”--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nProjectors in great numbers endeavoured to introduce themselves not only\r\nto the Queen, but to Madame Elisabeth, who had communications with many\r\nindividuals who took upon themselves to make plans for the conduct of the\r\nCourt.  The Baron de Gilliers and M. de Vanoise were of this description;\r\nthey went to the Baronne de Mackau’s, where the Princess spent almost all\r\nher evenings.  The Queen did not like these meetings, where Madame\r\nElisabeth might adopt views in opposition to the King’s intentions or her\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe Queen gave frequent audiences to M. de La Fayette.  One day, when he\r\nwas in her inner closet, his aides-de-camp, who waited for him, were\r\nwalking up and down the great room where the persons in attendance\r\nremained.  Some imprudent young women were thoughtless enough to say, with\r\nthe intention of being overheard by those officers, that it was very\r\nalarming to see the Queen alone with a rebel and a brigand.  I was annoyed\r\nat their indiscretion, and imposed silence on them.  One of them persisted\r\nin the appellation “brigand.”  I told her that M. de La Fayette well\r\ndeserved the name of rebel, but that the title of leader of a party was\r\ngiven by history to every man commanding forty thousand men, a capital,\r\nand forty leagues of country; that kings had frequently treated with such\r\nleaders, and if it was convenient to the Queen to do the same, it remained\r\nfor us only to be silent and respect her actions.  On the morrow the\r\nQueen, with a serious air; but with the greatest kindness, asked what I\r\nhad said respecting M. de La Fayette on the preceding day; adding that she\r\nhad been assured I had enjoined her women silence, because they did not\r\nlike him, and that I had taken his part.  I repeated what had passed to\r\nthe Queen, word for word.  She condescended to tell me that I had done\r\nperfectly right.\r\n\r\nWhenever any false reports respecting me were conveyed to her she was kind\r\nenough to inform me of them; and they had no effect on the confidence with\r\nwhich she continued to honour me, and which I am happy to think I have\r\njustified even at the risk of my life.\r\n\r\nMesdames, the King’s aunts, set out from Bellevue in the beginning of the\r\nyear 1791.  Alexandre Berthier, afterwards Prince de Neufchatel, then a\r\ncolonel on the staff of the army, and commandant of the National Guard of\r\nVersailles, facilitated the departure of Mesdames.  The Jacobins of that\r\ntown procured his dismissal, and he ran the greatest risk, on account of\r\nhaving rendered this service to these Princesses.\r\n\r\nI went to take leave of Madame Victoire.  I little thought that I was then\r\nseeing her for the last time.  She received me alone in her closet, and\r\nassured me that she hoped, as well as wished, soon to return to France;\r\nthat the French would be much to be pitied if the excesses of the\r\nRevolution should arrive at such a pitch as to force her to prolong her\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\n[General Berthier justified the monarch’s confidence by a firm and prudent\r\nline of conduct which entitled him to the highest military honours, and to\r\nthe esteem of the great warrior whose fortune, dangers, and glory he\r\nafterwards shared.  This officer, full of honour, and gifted with the\r\nhighest courage, was shut into the courtyard of Bellevue by his own troop,\r\nand ran great risk of being murdered.  It was not until the 14th of March\r\nthat he succeeded in executing his instructions (“Memoirs of Mesdames,” by\r\nMontigny, vol. i.)]\r\n\r\nI knew from the Queen that the departure of Mesdames was deemed\r\nnecessary, in order to leave the King free to act when he should be\r\ncompelled to go away with his family.  It being impossible that the\r\nconstitution of the clergy should be otherwise than in direct opposition\r\nto the religious principles of Mesdames, they thought their journey to\r\nRome would be attributed to piety alone.  It was, however, difficult to\r\ndeceive an Assembly which weighed the slightest actions of the royal\r\nfamily, and from that moment they were more than ever alive to what was\r\npassing at the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nMesdames were desirous of taking Madame Elisabeth to Rome.  The free\r\nexercise of religion, the happiness of taking refuge with the head of the\r\nChurch, and the prospect of living in safety with her aunts, whom she\r\ntenderly loved, were sacrificed by that virtuous Princess to her\r\nattachment to the King.\r\n\r\nThe oath required of priests by the civil constitution of the clergy\r\nintroduced into France a division which added to the dangers by which the\r\nKing was already surrounded.\r\n\r\n[The priests were required to swear to the civil constitution of the\r\nclergy of 1790, by which all the former bishoprics and parishes were\r\nremodelled, and the priests and bishops elected by the people.  Most\r\nrefused, and under the name of ‘pretres insermentes’ (as opposed to the\r\nfew who took the oath, ‘pretres assermentes’) were bitterly persecuted.  A\r\nsimple promise to obey the constitution of the State was substituted by\r\nNapoleon as soon as he came to power.]\r\n\r\nMirabeau spent a whole night with the cure of St. Eustache, confessor of\r\nthe King and Queen, to persuade him to take the oath required by that\r\nconstitution.  Their Majesties chose another confessor, who remained\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nA few months afterwards (2d April, 1791), the too celebrated Mirabeau, the\r\nmercenary democrat and venal royalist, terminated his career.  The Queen\r\nregretted him, and was astonished at her own regret; but she had hoped\r\nthat he who had possessed adroitness and weight enough to throw everything\r\ninto confusion would have been able by the same means to repair the\r\nmischief he had caused.  Much has been said respecting the cause of\r\nMirabeau’s death.  M. Cabanis, his friend and physician, denied that he\r\nwas poisoned.  M. Vicq-d’Azyr assured the Queen that the ‘proces-verbal’\r\ndrawn up on the state of the intestines would apply just as well to a case\r\nof death produced by violent remedies as to one produced by poison.  He\r\nsaid, also, that the report had been faithful; but that it was prudent to\r\nconclude it by a declaration of natural death, since, in the critical\r\nstate in which France then was, if a suspicion of foul play were admitted,\r\na person innocent of any such crime might be sacrificed to public\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the spring of 1791, the King, tired of remaining at\r\nthe Tuileries, wished to return to St. Cloud.  His whole household had\r\nalready gone, and his dinner was prepared there.  He got into his carriage\r\nat one; the guard mutinied, shut the gates, and declared they would not\r\nlet him pass.  This event certainly proceeded from some suspicion of a\r\nplan to escape.  Two persons who drew near the King’s carriage were very\r\nill treated.  My father-in-law was violently laid hold of by the guards,\r\nwho took his sword from him.  The King and his family were obliged to\r\nalight and return to their apartments.\r\n\r\nThey did not much regret this outrage in their hearts; they saw in it a\r\njustification, even in the eyes of the people, of their intention to leave\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nSo early as the month of March in the same year, the Queen began to busy\r\nherself in preparing for her departure.  I spent that month with her, and\r\nexecuted a great number of secret orders which she gave me respecting the\r\nintended event.  It was with uneasiness that I saw her occupied with cares\r\nwhich seemed to me useless, and even dangerous, and I remarked to her that\r\nthe Queen of France would find linen and gowns everywhere. My observations\r\nwere made in vain; she determined to have a complete wardrobe with her at\r\nBrussels, as well for her children as herself. I went out alone and almost\r\ndisguised to purchase the articles necessary and have them made up.\r\n\r\nI ordered six chemises at the shop of one seamstress, six at that of\r\nanother, gowns, combing cloths, etc.  My sister had a complete set of\r\nclothes made for Madame, by the measure of her eldest daughter, and I\r\nordered clothes for the Dauphin from those of my son.  I filled a trunk\r\nwith these things, and addressed them, by the Queen’s orders, to one of\r\nher women, my aunt, Madame Cardon,--a widow living at Arras, by virtue of\r\nan unlimited leave of absence,--in order that she might be ready to start\r\nfor Brussels, or any other place, as soon as she should be directed to do\r\nso.  This lady had landed property in Austrian Flanders, and could at any\r\ntime quit Arras unobserved.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was to take only her first woman in attendance with her from\r\nParis.  She apprised me that if I should not be on duty at the moment of\r\ndeparture, she would make arrangements for my joining her.  She determined\r\nalso to take her travelling dressing-case.  She consulted me on her idea\r\nof sending it off, under pretence of making a present of it to the\r\nArchduchess Christina, Gouvernante of the Netherlands.  I ventured to\r\noppose this plan strongly, and observed that, amidst so many people who\r\nwatched her slightest actions, there would be found a sufficient number\r\nsharp-sighted enough to discover that it was only a pretext for sending\r\naway the property in question before her own departure; she persisted in\r\nher intention, and all I could arrange was that the dressing-case should\r\nnot be removed from her apartment, and that M. de charge d’afaires from\r\nthe Court of Vienna during the absence of the Comte de Mercy, should come\r\nand ask her, at her toilet, before all her people, to order one exactly\r\nlike her own for Madame the Gouvernante of the Netherlands.  The Queen,\r\ntherefore, commanded me before the charge d’affaires to order the article\r\nin question.  This occasioned only an expense of five hundred louis, and\r\nappeared calculated to lull suspicion completely.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of May, 1791, a month after the Queen had ordered me to\r\nbespeak the dressing-case, she asked me whether it would soon be finished.\r\nI sent for the ivory-turner who had it in hand.  He could not complete it\r\nfor six weeks.  I informed the Queen of this, and she told me she should\r\nnot be able to wait for it, as she was to set out in the course of June.\r\nShe added that, as she had ordered her sister’s dressing-case in the\r\npresence of all her attendants, she had taken a sufficient precaution,\r\nespecially by saying that her sister was out of patience at not receiving\r\nit, and that therefore her own must be emptied and cleaned, and taken to\r\nthe charge d’affaires, who would send it off. I executed this order\r\nwithout any, appearance of mystery.  I desired the wardrobe woman to take\r\nout of the dressing-case all that it contained, because that intended for\r\nthe Archduchess could not be finished for some time; and to take great\r\ncare to leave no remains of the perfumes which might not suit that\r\nPrincess.\r\n\r\nThe woman in question executed her commission punctually; but, on the\r\nevening of that very day, the 15th of May, 1791, she informed M. Bailly,\r\nthe Mayor of Paris, that preparations were making at the Queen’s residence\r\nfor a departure; and that the dressing-case was already sent off, under\r\npretence of its being presented to the Archduchess Christina.\r\n\r\n[After the return from Varennes M. Bailly put this woman’s deposition into\r\nthe Queen’s hands.--MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, likewise, to send off all the diamonds belonging to the\r\nQueen.  Her Majesty shut herself up with me in a closet in the entresol,\r\nlooking into the garden of the Tuileries, and we packed all the diamonds,\r\nrubies, and pearls she possessed in a small chest.  The cases containing\r\nthese ornaments, being altogether of considerable bulk, had been\r\ndeposited, ever since the 6th of October, 1789, with the valet de chambre\r\nwho had the care of the Queen’s jewels.  That faithful servant, himself\r\ndetecting the use that was to be made of the valuables, destroyed all the\r\nboxes, which were, as usual, covered with red morocco, marked with the\r\ncipher and arms of France.  It would have been impossible for him to hide\r\nthem from the eyes of the popular inquisitors during the domiciliary\r\nvisits in January, 1793, and the discovery might have formed a ground of\r\naccusation against the Queen.\r\n\r\nI had but a few articles to place in the box when the Queen was compelled\r\nto desist from packing it, being obliged to go down to cards, which began\r\nat seven precisely.  She therefore desired me to leave all the diamonds\r\nupon the sofa, persuaded that, as she took the key of her closet herself,\r\nand there was a sentinel under the window, no danger was to be apprehended\r\nfor that night, and she reckoned upon returning very early next day to\r\nfinish the work.\r\n\r\nThe same woman who had given information of the sending away of the\r\ndressing-case was also deputed by the Queen to take care of her more\r\nprivate rooms.  No other servant was permitted to enter them; she renewed\r\nthe flowers, swept the carpets, etc.  The Queen received back the key,\r\nwhen the woman had finished putting them in order, from her own hands;\r\nbut, desirous of doing her duty well, and sometimes having the key in her\r\npossession for a few minutes only, she had probably on that account\r\nordered one without the Queen’s knowledge.  It is impossible not to\r\nbelieve this, since the despatch of the diamonds was the subject of a\r\nsecond accusation which the Queen heard of after the return from Varennes.\r\nShe made a formal declaration that her Majesty, with the assistance of\r\nMadame Campan, had packed up all her jewelry some time before the\r\ndeparture; that she was certain of it, as she had found the diamonds, and\r\nthe cotton which served to wrap them, scattered upon the sofa in the\r\nQueen’s closet in the ‘entresol’; and most assuredly she could only have\r\nseen these preparations in the interval between seven in the evening and\r\nseven in the morning.  The Queen having met me next day at the time\r\nappointed, the box was handed over to Leonard, her Majesty’s\r\nhairdresser,--[This unfortunate man, after having emigrated for some time,\r\nreturned to France, and perished upon the scaffold.--NOTE BY EDITOR]--who\r\nleft the country with the Duc de Choiseul.  The box remained a long time\r\nat Brussels, and at length got into the hands of Madame la Duchesse\r\nd’Angouleme, being delivered to her by the Emperor on her arrival at\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\nIn order not to leave out any of the Queen’s diamonds, I requested the\r\nfirst tirewoman to give me the body of the full dress, and all the\r\nassortment which served for the stomacher of the full dress on days of\r\nstate, articles which always remained at the wardrobe.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent and the dame d’honneur being absent, the first\r\ntirewoman required me to sign a receipt, the terms of which she dictated,\r\nand which acquitted her of all responsibility for these diamonds. She had\r\nthe prudence to burn this document on the 10th of August, 1792.--[The date\r\nof the sack of the Tuileries and slaughter of the Swiss Guard]--The Queen\r\nhaving determined, upon the arrest at Varennes, not to have her diamonds\r\nbrought back to France, was often anxious about them during the year which\r\nelapsed between that period and the 10th of August, and dreaded above all\r\nthings that such a secret should be discovered.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a decree of the Assembly, which deprived the King of the\r\ncustody of the Crown diamonds, the Queen had at this time already given up\r\nthose which she generally used.\r\n\r\nShe preferred the twelve brilliants called Hazarins, from the name of the\r\nCardinal who had enriched the treasury with them, a few rose-cut diamonds,\r\nand the Sanci.  She determined to deliver, with her own hands, the box\r\ncontaining them to the commissioner nominated by the National Assembly to\r\nplace them with the Crown diamonds.  After giving them to him, she offered\r\nhim a row of pearls of great beauty, saying to him that it had been\r\nbrought into France by Anne of Austria; that it was invaluable, on account\r\nof its rarity; that, having been appropriated by that Princess to the use\r\nof the Queens and Dauphinesses, Louis XV.  had placed it in her hands on\r\nher arrival in France; but that she considered it national property.\r\n“That is an open question, Madame,” said the commissary.  “Monsieur,”\r\n replied the Queen, “it is one for me to decide, and is now settled.”\r\n\r\nMy father-in-law, who was dying of the grief he felt for the misfortunes\r\nof his master and mistress, strongly interested and occupied the thoughts\r\nof the Queen.  He had been saved from the fury of the populace in the\r\ncourtyard of the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nOn the day on which the King was compelled by an insurrection to give up a\r\njourney to St. Cloud, her Majesty looked upon this trusty servant as\r\ninevitably lost, if, on going away, she should leave him in the apartment\r\nhe occupied in the Tuileries.  Prompted by her apprehensions, she ordered\r\nM. Vicq-d’Azyr, her physician, to recommend him the waters of Mont d’Or in\r\nAuvergne, and to persuade him to set off at the latter end of May. At the\r\nmoment of my going away the Queen assured me that the grand project would\r\nbe executed between the 15th and the 20th of June; that as it was not my\r\nmonth to be on duty, Madame Thibaut would take the journey; but that she\r\nhad many directions to give me before I went.  She then desired me to\r\nwrite to my aunt, Madame Cardon, who was by that time in possession of the\r\nclothes which I had ordered, that as soon as she should receive a letter\r\nfrom M. Augur, the date of which should be accompanied with a B, an L, or\r\nan M, she was to proceed with her property to Brussels, Luxembourg, or\r\nMontmedy.  She desired me to explain the meaning of these three letters\r\nclearly to my sister, and to leave them with her in writing, in order that\r\nat the moment of my going away she might be able to take my place in\r\nwriting to Arras.\r\n\r\nThe Queen had a more delicate commission for me; it was to select from\r\namong my acquaintance a prudent person of obscure rank, wholly devoted to\r\nthe interests of the Court, who would be willing to receive a portfolio\r\nwhich she was to give up only to me, or some one furnished with a note\r\nfrom the Queen.  She added that she would not travel with this portfolio,\r\nand that it was of the utmost importance that my opinion of the fidelity\r\nof the person to whom it was to be entrusted should be well founded.  I\r\nproposed to her Madame Vallayer Coster, a painter of the Academy, and an\r\namiable and worthy artist, whom I had known from my infancy.  She lived in\r\nthe galleries of the Louvre.  The choice seemed a good one.  The Queen\r\nremembered that she had made her marriage possible by giving her a place\r\nin the financial offices, and added that gratitude ought sometimes to be\r\nreckoned on.  She then pointed out to me the valet belonging to her\r\ntoilet, whom I was to take with me, to show him the residence of Madame\r\nCoster, so that he might not mistake it when he should take the portfolio\r\nto her.  The day before her departure the Queen particularly recommended\r\nme to proceed to Lyons and the frontiers as soon as she should have\r\nstarted.  She advised me to take with me a confidential person, fit to\r\nremain with M. Campan when I should leave him, and assured me that she\r\nwould give orders to M. ------ to set off as soon as she should be known\r\nto be at the frontiers in order to protect me in going out.  She\r\ncondescended to add that, having a long journey to make in foreign\r\ncountries, she determined to give me three hundred louis.\r\n\r\nI bathed the Queen’s hands with tears at the moment of this sorrowful\r\nseparation; and, having money at my disposal, I declined accepting her\r\ngold.  I did not dread the road I had to travel in order to rejoin her;\r\nall my apprehension was that by treachery or miscalculation a scheme, the\r\nsafety of which was not sufficiently clear to me, should fail.  I could\r\nanswer for all those who belonged to the service immediately about the\r\nQueen’s person, and I was right; but her wardrobe woman gave me\r\nwell-founded reason for alarm.  I mentioned to the Queen many\r\nrevolutionary remarks which this woman had made to me a few days before.\r\nHer office was directly under the control of the first femme de chambre,\r\nyet she had refused to obey the directions I gave her, talking insolently\r\nto me about “hierarchy overturned, equality among men,” of course more\r\nespecially among persons holding offices at Court; and this jargon, at\r\nthat time in the mouths of all the partisans of the Revolution, was\r\nterminated by an observation which frightened me.  “You know many\r\nimportant secrets, madame,” said this woman to me, “and I have guessed\r\nquite as many.  I am not a fool; I see all that is going forward here in\r\nconsequence of the bad advice given to the King and Queen; I could\r\nfrustrate it all if I chose.”  This argument, in which I had been promptly\r\nsilenced, left me pale and trembling.  Unfortunately, as I began my\r\nnarrative to the Queen with particulars of this woman’s refusal to obey\r\nme,--and sovereigns are all their lives importuned with complaints upon\r\nthe rights of places,--she believed that my own dissatisfaction had much\r\nto do with the step I was taking; and she did not sufficiently fear the\r\nwoman.  Her office, although a very inferior one, brought her in nearly\r\nfifteen thousand francs a year.  Still young, tolerably handsome, with\r\ncomfortable apartments in the entresols of the Tuileries, she saw a great\r\ndeal of company, and in the evening had assemblies, consisting of deputies\r\nof the revolutionary party.  M. de Gouvion, major-general of the National\r\nGuard, passed almost every day with her; and it is to be presumed that she\r\nhad long worked for the party in opposition to the Court.  The Queen asked\r\nher for the key of a door which led to the principal vestibule of the\r\nTuileries, telling her she wished to have a similar one, that she might\r\nnot be under the necessity of going out through the pavilion of Flora. M.\r\nde Gouvion and M. de La Fayette would, of course, be apprised of this\r\ncircumstance, and well-informed persons have assured me that on the very\r\nnight of the Queen’s departure this wretched woman had a spy with her, who\r\nsaw the royal family set off.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had executed all the Queen’s orders, on the 30th of May,\r\n1791, I set out for Auvergne, and was settled in the gloomy narrow valley\r\nof Mont d’Or, when, about four in the afternoon of the 25th of June, I\r\nheard the beat of a drum to call the inhabitants of the hamlet together.\r\nWhen it had ceased I heard a hairdresser from Bresse proclaim in the\r\nprovincial dialect of Auvergne: “The King and Queen were taking flight in\r\norder to ruin France, but I come to tell you that they are stopped, and\r\nare well guarded by a hundred thousand men under arms.”  I still ventured\r\nto hope that he was repeating only a false report, but he went on: “The\r\nQueen,” with her well-known haughtiness, lifted up the veil which covered\r\nher face, and said to the citizens who were upbraiding the King, “Well,\r\nsince you recognise your sovereign, respect him.”  Upon hearing these\r\nexpressions, which the Jacobin club of Clermont could not have invented, I\r\nexclaimed, “The news is true!”\r\n\r\nI immediately learnt that, a courier being come from Paris to Clermont,\r\nthe ‘procureur’ of the commune had sent off messengers to the chief places\r\nof the canton; these again sent couriers to the districts, and the\r\ndistricts in like manner informed the villages and hamlets which they\r\ncontained.  It was through this ramification, arising from the\r\nestablishment of clubs, that the afflicting intelligence of the misfortune\r\nof my sovereigns reached me in the wildest part of France, and in the\r\nmidst of the snows by which we were environed.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th I received a note written in a hand which I recognised as that\r\nof M. Diet,--[This officer was slain in the Queen’s chamber on the 10th of\r\nAugust]--usher of the Queen’s chamber, but dictated by her Majesty.  It\r\ncontained these words: “I am this moment arrived; I have just got into my\r\nbath; I and my family exist, that is all.  I have suffered much.  Do not\r\nreturn to Paris until I desire you.  Take good care of my poor Campan,\r\nsoothe his sorrow.  Look for happier times.” This note was for greater\r\nsafety addressed to my father-in-law’s valet-de-chambre.  What were my\r\nfeelings on perceiving that after the most distressing crisis we were\r\namong the first objects of the kindness of that unfortunate Princess!\r\n\r\nM. Campan having been unable to benefit by the waters of Mont d’Or, and\r\nthe first popular effervescence having subsided, I thought I might return\r\nto Clermont.  The committee of surveillance, or that of general safety,\r\nhad resolved to arrest me there; but the Abbe Louis, formerly a\r\nparliamentary counsellor, and then a member of the Constituent Assembly,\r\nwas kind enough to affirm that I was in Auvergne solely for the purpose of\r\nattending my father-in-law, who was extremely ill.  The precautions\r\nrelative to my absence from Paris were limited to placing us under the\r\nsurveillance of the ‘procureur’ of the commune, who was at the same time\r\npresident of the Jacobin club; but he was also a physician of repute, and\r\nwithout having any doubt that he had received secret orders relative to\r\nme, I thought it would favour the chances of our safety if I selected him\r\nto attend my patient.  I paid him according to the rate given to the best\r\nParis physicians, and I requested him to visit us every morning and every\r\nevening.  I took the precaution to subscribe to no other newspaper than\r\nthe Moniteur.  Doctor Monestier (for that was the physician’s name)\r\nfrequently took upon himself to read it to us.  Whenever he thought proper\r\nto speak of the King and Queen in the insulting and brutal terms at that\r\ntime unfortunately adopted throughout France, I used to stop him and say,\r\ncoolly, “Monsieur, you are here in company with the servants of Louis XVI.\r\nand Marie Antoinette.  Whatever may be the wrongs with which the nation\r\nbelieves it has to reproach them, our principles forbid our losing sight\r\nof the respect due to them from us.”  Notwithstanding that he was an\r\ninveterate patriot, he felt the force of this remark, and even procured\r\nthe revocation of a second order for our arrest, becoming responsible for\r\nus to the committee of the Assembly, and to the Jacobin society.\r\n\r\nThe two chief women about the Dauphin, who had accompanied the Queen to\r\nVarennes, Diet, her usher, and Camot, her garcon de toilette,--the women\r\non account of the journey, and the men in consequence of the denunciation\r\nof the woman belonging to the wardrobe,--were sent to the prisons of the\r\nAbbaye.  After my departure the garcon de toilette whom I had taken to\r\nMadame Vallayer Coster’s was sent there with the portfolio she had agreed\r\nto receive.  This commission could not escape the detestable spy upon the\r\nQueen.  She gave information that a portfolio had been carried out on the\r\nevening of the departure, adding that the King had placed it upon the\r\nQueen’s easy-chair, that the garcon de toilette wrapped it up in a napkin\r\nand took it under his arm, and that she did not know where he had carried\r\nit.  The man, who was remarkable for his fidelity, underwent three\r\nexaminations without making the slightest disclosure.  M. Diet, a man of\r\ngood family, a servant on whom the Queen placed particular reliance,\r\nlikewise experienced the severest treatment.  At length, after a lapse of\r\nthree weeks, the Queen succeeded in obtaining the release of her servants.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, about the 15th of August, had me informed by letter that I\r\nmight come back to Paris without being under any apprehension of arrest\r\nthere, and that she greatly desired my return.  I brought my father-in-law\r\nback in a dying state, and on the day preceding that of the acceptation of\r\nthe constitutional act, I informed the Queen that he was no more.  “The\r\nloss of Lassonne and Campan,” said she, as she applied her handkerchief to\r\nher streaming eyes, “has taught me how valuable such subjects are to their\r\nmasters.  I shall never find their equals.”\r\n\r\nI resumed my functions about the Queen on the 1st of September, 1791. She\r\nwas unable then to converse with me on all the lamentable events which had\r\noccurred since the time of my leaving her, having on guard near her an\r\nofficer whom she dreaded more than all the others.  She merely told me\r\nthat I should have some secret services to perform for her, and that she\r\nwould not create uneasiness by long conversations with me, my return being\r\na subject of suspicion.  But next day the Queen, well knowing the\r\ndiscretion of the officer who was to be on guard that night, had my bed\r\nplaced very near hers, and having obtained the favour of having the door\r\nshut, when I was in bed she began the narrative of the journey, and the\r\nunfortunate arrest at Varennes.  I asked her permission to put on my gown,\r\nand kneeling by her bedside I remained until three o’clock in the morning,\r\nlistening with the liveliest and most sorrowful interest to the account I\r\nam about to repeat, and of which I have seen various details, of tolerable\r\nexactness, in papers of the time.\r\n\r\nThe King entrusted Count Fersen with all the preparations for departure.\r\nThe carriage was ordered by him; the passport, in the name of Madame de\r\nKorf, was procured through his connection with that lady, who was a\r\nforeigner.  And lastly, he himself drove the royal family, as their\r\ncoachman, as far as Bondy, where the travellers got into their berlin.\r\nMadame Brunier and Madame Neuville, the first women of Madame and the\r\nDauphin, there joined the principal carriage.  They were in a cabriolet.\r\nMonsieur and Madame set out from the Luxembourg and took another road.\r\nThey as well as the King were recognised by the master of the last post in\r\nFrance, but this man, devoting himself to the fortunes of the Prince, left\r\nthe French territory, and drove them himself as postilion.  Madame\r\nThibaut, the Queen’s first woman, reached Brussels without the slightest\r\ndifficulty.  Madame Cardon, from Arras, met with no hindrance; and\r\nLeonard, the Queen’s hairdresser, passed through Varennes a few hours\r\nbefore the royal family.  Fate had reserved all its obstacles for the\r\nunfortunate monarch.\r\n\r\nNothing worthy of notice occurred in the beginning of the journey.  The\r\ntravellers were detained a short time, about twelve leagues from Paris, by\r\nsome repairs which the carriage required.  The King chose to walk up one\r\nof the hills, and these two circumstances caused a delay of three hours,\r\nprecisely at the time when it was intended that the berlin should have\r\nbeen met, just before reaching Varennes, by the detachment commanded by M.\r\nde Goguelat.  This detachment was punctually stationed upon the spot fixed\r\non, with orders to wait there for the arrival of certain treasure, which\r\nit was to escort; but the peasantry of the neighbourhood, alarmed at the\r\nsight of this body of troops, came armed with staves, and asked several\r\nquestions, which manifested their anxiety.  M. de Goguelat, fearful of\r\ncausing a riot, and not finding the carriage arrive as he expected,\r\ndivided his men into two companies, and unfortunately made them leave the\r\nhighway in order to return to Varennes by two cross roads. The King looked\r\nout of the carriage at Ste. Menehould, and asked several questions\r\nconcerning the road.  Drouet, the post-master, struck by the resemblance\r\nof Louis to the impression of his head upon the assignats, drew near the\r\ncarriage, felt convinced that he recognised the Queen also, and that the\r\nremainder of the travellers consisted of the royal family and their suite,\r\nmounted his horse, reached Varennes by cross roads before the royal\r\nfugitives, and gave the alarm.--[Varennes lies between Verdun and\r\nMontmedy, and not far from the French frontier.]\r\n\r\nThe Queen began to feel all the agonies of terror; they were augmented by\r\nthe voice of a person unknown, who, passing close to the carriage in full\r\ngallop, cried out, bending towards the window without slackening his\r\nspeed, “You are recognised!”  They arrived with beating hearts at the\r\ngates of Varennes without meeting one of the horsemen by whom they were to\r\nhave been escorted into the place.  They were ignorant where to find their\r\nrelays, and some minutes were lost in waiting, to no purpose.  The\r\ncabriolet had preceded them, and the two ladies in attendance found the\r\nbridge already blocked up with old carts and lumber.  The town guards were\r\nall under arms.  The King at last entered Varennes.  M. de Goguelat had\r\narrived there with his detachment.  He came up to the King and asked him\r\nif he chose to effect a passage by force!  What an unlucky question to put\r\nto Louis XVI., who from the very beginning of the Revolution had shown in\r\nevery crisis the fear he entertained of giving the least order which might\r\ncause an effusion of blood!  “Would it be a brisk action?” said the King.\r\n“It is impossible that it should be otherwise, Sire,” replied the\r\naide-decamp.  Louis XVI. was unwilling to expose his family. They\r\ntherefore went to the house of a grocer, Mayor of Varennes.  The King\r\nbegan to speak, and gave a summary of his intentions in departing,\r\nanalogous to the declaration he had made at Paris.  He spoke with warmth\r\nand affability, and endeavoured to demonstrate to the people around him\r\nthat he had only put himself, by the step he had taken, into a fit\r\nsituation to treat with the Assembly, and to sanction with freedom the\r\nconstitution which he would maintain, though many of its articles were\r\nincompatible with the dignity of the throne, and the force by which it was\r\nnecessary that the sovereign should be surrounded.  Nothing could be more\r\naffecting, added the Queen, than this moment, in which the King felt bound\r\nto communicate to the very humblest class of his subjects his principles,\r\nhis wishes for the happiness of his people, and the motives which had\r\ndetermined him to depart.\r\n\r\nWhilst the King was speaking to this mayor, whose name was Sauce, the\r\nQueen, seated at the farther end of the shop, among parcels of soap and\r\ncandles, endeavoured to make Madame Sauce understand that if she would\r\nprevail upon her husband to make use of his municipal authority to cover\r\nthe flight of the King and his family, she would have the glory of having\r\ncontributed to restore tranquillity to France.  This woman was moved; she\r\ncould not, without streaming eyes, see herself thus solicited by her\r\nQueen; but she could not be got to say anything more than, “Bon Dieu,\r\nMadame, it would be the destruction of M. Sauce; I love my King, but I\r\nlove my husband too, you must know, and he would be answerable, you see.”\r\n Whilst this strange scene was passing in the shop, the people, hearing\r\nthat the King was arrested, kept pouring in from all parts.  M. de\r\nGoguelat, making a last effort, demanded of the dragoons whether they\r\nwould protect the departure of the King; they replied only by murmurs,\r\ndropping the points of their swords.  Some person unknown fired a pistol\r\nat M. de Goguelat; he was slightly wounded by the ball.  M. Romeuf,\r\naide-de-camp to M. de La Fayette, arrived at that moment.  He had been\r\nchosen, after the 6th of October, 1789, by the commander of the Parisian\r\nguard to be in constant attendance about the Queen.  She reproached him\r\nbitterly with the object of his mission.  “If you wish to make your name\r\nremarkable, monsieur,” said the Queen to him, “you have chosen strange and\r\nodious means, which will produce the most fatal consequences.”  This\r\nofficer wished to hasten their departure.  The Queen, still cherishing the\r\nhope of seeing M. de Bouille arrive with a sufficient force to extricate\r\nthe King from his critical situation, prolonged her stay at Varennes by\r\nevery means in her power.\r\n\r\nThe Dauphin’s first woman pretended to be taken ill with a violent colic,\r\nand threw herself upon a bed, in the hope of aiding the designs of her\r\nsuperiors; she went and implored for assistance.  The Queen understood her\r\nperfectly well, and refused to leave one who had devoted herself to follow\r\nthem in such a state of suffering.  But no delay in departing was allowed.\r\nThe three Body Guards (Valory, Du Moustier, and Malden) were gagged and\r\nfastened upon the seat of the carriage.  A horde of National Guards,\r\nanimated with fury and the barbarous joy with which their fatal triumph\r\ninspired them, surrounded the carriage of the royal family.\r\n\r\nThe three commissioners sent by the Assembly to meet the King, MM. de\r\nLatour-Maubourg, Barnave, and Potion, joined them in the environs of\r\nEpernay.  The two last mentioned got into the King’s carriage.  The Queen\r\nastonished me by the favourable opinion she had formed of Barnave. When I\r\nquitted Paris a great many persons spoke of him only with horror. She told\r\nme he was much altered, that he was full of talent and noble feeling.  “A\r\nfeeling of pride which I cannot much blame in a young man belonging to the\r\nTiers Etat,” she said, “made him applaud everything which smoothed the\r\nroad to rank and fame for that class in which he was born.  And if we get\r\nthe power in our own hands again, Barnave’s pardon is already written on\r\nour hearts.”  The Queen added, that she had not the same feeling towards\r\nthose nobles who had joined the revolutionary party, who had always\r\nreceived marks of favour, often to the injury of those beneath them in\r\nrank, and who, born to be the safeguard of the monarchy, could never be\r\npardoned for having deserted it.  She then told me that Barnave’s conduct\r\nupon the road was perfectly correct, while Potion’s republican rudeness\r\nwas disgusting; that the latter ate and drank in the King’s berlin in a\r\nslovenly manner, throwing the bones of the fowls out through the window at\r\nthe risk of sending them even into the King’s face; lifting up his glass,\r\nwhen Madame Elisabeth poured him out wine, to show her that there was\r\nenough, without saying a word; that this offensive behaviour must have\r\nbeen intentional, because the man was not without education; and that\r\nBarnave was hurt at it.  On being pressed by the Queen to take something,\r\n“Madame,” replied Barnave, “on so solemn an occasion the deputies of the\r\nNational Assembly ought to occupy your Majesties solely about their\r\nmission, and by no means about their wants.” In short, his respectful\r\ndelicacy, his considerate attentions, and all that he said, gained the\r\nesteem not only of the Queen, but of Madame Elisabeth also.\r\n\r\nThe King began to talk to Petion about the situation of France, and the\r\nmotives of his conduct, which were founded upon the necessity of giving to\r\nthe executive power a strength necessary for its action, for the good even\r\nof the constitutional act, since France could not be a republic. “Not yet,\r\n‘tis true,” replied Petion, “because the French are not ripe enough for\r\nthat.”  This audacious and cruel answer silenced the King, who said no\r\nmore until his arrival at Paris.  Potion held the little Dauphin upon his\r\nknees, and amused himself with curling the beautiful light hair of the\r\ninteresting child round his fingers; and, as he spoke with much\r\ngesticulation, he pulled his locks hard enough to make the Dauphin cry\r\nout.  “Give me my son,” said the Queen to him; “he is accustomed to\r\ntenderness and delicacy, which render him little fit for such\r\nfamiliarity.”\r\n\r\nThe Chevalier de Dampierre was killed near the King’s carriage upon\r\nleaving Varennes.  A poor village cure, some leagues from the place where\r\nthe crime was committed, was imprudent enough to draw near to speak to the\r\nKing; the cannibals who surrounded the carriage rushed upon him. “Tigers,”\r\n exclaimed Barnave, “have you ceased to be Frenchmen?  Nation of brave men,\r\nare you become a set of assassins?”  These words alone saved the cure, who\r\nwas already upon the ground, from certain death.  Barnave, as he spoke to\r\nthem, threw himself almost out of the coach window, and Madame Elisabeth,\r\naffected by this noble burst of feeling, held him by the skirt of his\r\ncoat.  The Queen, while speaking of this event, said that on the most\r\nmomentous occasions whimsical contrasts always struck her, and that even\r\nat such a moment the pious Elisabeth holding Barnave by the flap of his\r\ncoat was a ludicrous sight.\r\n\r\nThe deputy was astonished in another way.  Madame Elisabeth’s comments\r\nupon the state of France, her mild and persuasive eloquence, and the, ease\r\nand simplicity with which she talked to him, yet without sacrificing her\r\ndignity in the slightest degree, appeared to him unique, and his heart,\r\nwhich was doubtless inclined to right principles though he had followed\r\nthe wrong path, was overcome by admiration.  The conduct of the two\r\ndeputies convinced the Queen of the total separation between the\r\nrepublican and constitutional parties.  At the inns where she alighted she\r\nhad some private conversation with Barnave.  The latter said a great deal\r\nabout the errors committed by the royalists during the Revolution, adding\r\nthat he had found the interest of the Court so feebly and so badly\r\ndefended that he had been frequently tempted to go and offer it, in\r\nhimself, an aspiring champion, who knew the spirit of the age and nation.\r\nThe Queen asked him what was the weapon he would have recommended her to\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n“Popularity, Madame.”\r\n\r\n“And how could I use that,” replied her Majesty, “of which I have been\r\ndeprived?”\r\n\r\n“Ah!  Madame, it was much more easy for you to regain it, than for me to\r\nacquire it.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen mainly attributed the arrest at Varennes to M. de Goguelat; she\r\nsaid he calculated the time that would be spent in the journey\r\nerroneously.  He performed that from Montmedy to Paris before taking the\r\nKing’s last orders, alone in a post-chaise, and he founded all his\r\ncalculations upon the time he spent thus.  The trial has been made since,\r\nand it was found that a light carriage without any courier was nearly\r\nthree hours less in running the distance than a heavy carriage preceded by\r\na courier.\r\n\r\nThe Queen also blamed him for having quitted the high-road at\r\nPont-de-Sommevelle, where the carriage was to meet the forty hussars\r\ncommanded by him.  She thought that he ought to have dispersed the very\r\nsmall number of people at Varennes, and not have asked the hussars whether\r\nthey were for the King or the nation; that, particularly, he ought to have\r\navoided taking the King’s orders, as he was previously aware of the reply\r\nM. d’Inisdal had received when it was proposed to carry off the King.\r\n\r\nAfter all that the Queen had said to me respecting the mistakes made by M.\r\nde Goguelat, I thought him of course disgraced.  What was my surprise\r\nwhen, having been set at liberty after the amnesty which followed the\r\nacceptance of the constitution, he presented himself to the Queen, and was\r\nreceived with the greatest kindness!  She said he had done what he could,\r\nand that his zeal ought to form an excuse for all the rest.\r\n\r\n[Full details of the preparations for the flight to Varennes will be found\r\nin “Le Comte de Fersen et La Cour de France,” Paris, Didot et Cie, 1878 (a\r\nreview of which was given in the Quarterly Review for July, 1880), and in\r\nthe “Memoirs of the Marquis de Bouille”, London, Cadell and Davis, 1797;\r\nCount Fersen being the person who planned the actual escape, and De\r\nBouille being in command of the army which was to receive the King.  The\r\nplan was excellent, and would certainly have succeeded, if it had not been\r\nfor the royal family themselves.  Marie Antoinette, it will have been seen\r\nby Madame Campan’s account, nearly wrecked the plan from inability to do\r\nwithout a large dressing or travelling case.  The King did a more fatal\r\nthing.  De Bouille had pointed out the necessity for having in the King’s\r\ncarriage an officer knowing the route, and able to show himself to give\r\nall directions, and a proper person had been provided.  The King, however,\r\nobjected, as “he could not have the Marquis d’Agoult in the same carriage\r\nwith himself; the governess of the royal children, who was to accompany\r\nthem, having refused to abandon her privilege of constantly remaining with\r\nher charge.”  See “De Bouille,” pp. 307 and 334.  Thus, when Louis was\r\nrecognised at the window of the carriage by Drouet, he was lost by the\r\nvery danger that had been foreseen, and this wretched piece of etiquette\r\nled to his death.]\r\n\r\nWhen the royal family was brought back from Varennes to the Tuileries, the\r\nQueen’s attendants found the greatest difficulty in making their way to\r\nher apartments; everything had been arranged so that the wardrobe woman,\r\nwho had acted as spy, should have the service; and she was to be assisted\r\nin it only by her sister and her sister’s daughter.\r\n\r\nM. de Gouvion, M. de La Fayette’s aide-de-camp, had this woman’s portrait\r\nplaced at the foot of the staircase which led to the Queen’s apartments,\r\nin order that the sentinel should not permit any other women to make their\r\nway in.  As soon as the Queen was informed of this contemptible\r\nprecaution, she told the King of it, who sent to ascertain the fact. His\r\nMajesty then called for M. de La Fayette, claimed freedom in his\r\nhousehold, and particularly in that of the Queen, and ordered him to send\r\na woman in, whom no one but himself could confide out of the palace. M. de\r\nLa Fayette was obliged to comply.\r\n\r\nOn the day when the return of the royal family was expected, there were no\r\ncarriages in motion in the streets of Paris.  Five or six of the Queen’s\r\nwomen, after being refused admittance at all the other gates, went with\r\none of my sisters to that of the Feuillans, insisting that the sentinel\r\nshould admit them.  The poissardes attacked them for their boldness in\r\nresisting the order excluding them.  One of them seized my sister by the\r\narm, calling her the slave of the Austrian.  “Hear me,” said my sister to\r\nher, “I have been attached to the Queen ever since I was fifteen years of\r\nage; she gave me my marriage portion; I served her when she was powerful\r\nand happy.  She is now unfortunate.  Ought I to abandon her?”--“She is\r\nright,” cried the poissardes; “she ought not to abandon her mistress; let\r\nus make an entry for them.”  They instantly surrounded the sentinel,\r\nforced the passage, and introduced the Queen’s women, accompanying them to\r\nthe terrace of the Feuillans.  One of these furies, whom the slightest\r\nimpulse would have driven to tear my sister to pieces, taking her under\r\nher protection, gave her advice by which she might reach the palace in\r\nsafety.  “But of all things, my dear friend,” said she to her, “pull off\r\nthat green ribbon sash; it is the color of that D’Artois, whom we will\r\nnever forgive.”\r\n\r\nThe measures adopted for guarding the King were rigorous with respect to\r\nthe entrance into the palace, and insulting as to his private apartments.\r\nThe commandants of battalion, stationed in the salon called the grand\r\ncabinet, and which led to the Queen’s bedchamber, were ordered to keep the\r\ndoor of it always open, in order that they might have their eyes upon the\r\nroyal family.  The King shut this door one day; the officer of the guard\r\nopened it, and told him such were his orders, and that he would always\r\nopen it; so that his Majesty in shutting it gave himself useless trouble.\r\nIt remained open even during the night, when the Queen was in bed; and the\r\nofficer placed himself in an armchair between the two doors, with his head\r\nturned towards her Majesty.  They only obtained permission to have the\r\ninner door shut when the Queen was rising.  The Queen had the bed of her\r\nfirst femme de chambre placed very near her own; this bed, which ran on\r\ncasters, and was furnished with curtains, hid her from the officer’s\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nMadame de Jarjaye, my companion, who continued her functions during the\r\nwhole period of my absence, told me that one night the commandant of\r\nbattalion, who slept between the two doors, seeing that she was sleeping\r\nsoundly, and that the Queen was awake, quitted his post and went close to\r\nher Majesty, to advise her as to the line of conduct she should pursue.\r\nAlthough she had the kindness to desire him to speak lower in order that\r\nhe might not disturb Madame de Jarjaye’s rest, the latter awoke, and\r\nnearly died with fright at seeing a man in the uniform of the Parisian\r\nguard so near the Queen’s bed.  Her Majesty comforted her, and told her\r\nnot to rise; that the person she saw was a good Frenchman, who was\r\ndeceived respecting the intentions and situation of his sovereign and\r\nherself, but whose conversation showed sincere attachment to the King.\r\n\r\nThere was a sentinel in the corridor which runs behind the apartments in\r\nquestion, where there is a staircase, which was at that time an inner one,\r\nand enabled the King and Queen to communicate freely.  This post, which\r\nwas very onerous, because it was to be kept four and twenty hours, was\r\noften claimed by Saint Prig, an actor belonging to the Theatre Francais.\r\nHe took it upon himself sometimes to contrive brief interviews between the\r\nKing and Queen in this corridor.  He left them at a distance, and gave\r\nthem warning if he heard the slightest noise.  M. Collot, commandant of\r\nbattalion of the National Guard, who was charged with the military duty of\r\nthe Queen’s household, in like manner softened down, so far as he could\r\nwith prudence, all, the revolting orders he received; for instance, one to\r\nfollow the Queen to the very door of her wardrobe was never executed.  An\r\nofficer of the Parisian guard dared to speak insolently of the Queen in\r\nher own apartment.  M. Collot wished to make a complaint to M. de La\r\nFayette against him, and have him dismissed.  The Queen opposed it, and\r\ncondescended to say a few words of explanation and kindness to the man; he\r\ninstantly became one of her most devoted partisans.\r\n\r\nThe first time I saw her Majesty after the unfortunate catastrophe of the\r\nVarennes journey, I found her getting out of bed; her features were not\r\nvery much altered; but after the first kind words she uttered to me she\r\ntook off her cap and desired me to observe the effect which grief had\r\nproduced upon her hair.  It had become, in one single night, as white as\r\nthat of a woman of seventy.  Her Majesty showed me a ring she had just had\r\nmounted for the Princesse de Lamballe; it contained a lock of her whitened\r\nhair, with the inscription, “Blanched by sorrow.”  At the period of the\r\nacceptance of the constitution the Princess wished to return to France.\r\nThe Queen, who had no expectation that tranquillity would be restored,\r\nopposed this; but the attachment of Madame de Lamballe to the royal family\r\nimpelled her to come and seek death.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Paris most of the harsh precautions were abandoned; the\r\ndoors were not kept open; greater respect was paid to the sovereign; it\r\nwas known that the constitution soon to be completed would be accepted,\r\nand a better order of things was hoped for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Paris on the 25th of August I found the state of feeling\r\nthere much more temperate than I had dared to hope.  The conversation\r\ngenerally ran upon the acceptance of the constitution, and the fetes which\r\nwould be given in consequence.  The struggle between the Jacobins and the\r\nconstitutionals on the 17th of July, 1791, nevertheless had thrown the\r\nQueen into great terror for some moments; and the firing of the cannon\r\nfrom the Champ de Mars upon a party which called for a trial of the King,\r\nand the leaders of which were in the very bosom of the Assembly, left the\r\nmost gloomy impressions upon her mind.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionals, the Queen’s connection with whom was not slackened by\r\nthe intervention of the three members already mentioned, had faithfully\r\nserved the royal family during their detention.\r\n\r\n“We still hold the wire by which this popular mass is moved,” said Barnave\r\nto M. de J----- one day, at the same time showing him a large volume, in\r\nwhich the names of all those who were influenced with the power of gold\r\nalone were registered.  It was at that time proposed to hire a\r\nconsiderable number of persons in order to secure loud acclamations when\r\nthe King and his family should make their appearance at the play upon the\r\nacceptance of the constitution.  That day, which afforded a glimmering\r\nhope of tranquillity, was the 14th of September; the fetes were brilliant;\r\nbut already fresh anxieties forbade the royal family to encourage much\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Assembly, which had just succeeded the Constituent\r\nAssembly (October, 1791), founded its conduct upon the wildest republican\r\nprinciples; created from the midst of popular assemblies, it was wholly\r\ninspired by the spirit which animated them.  The constitution, as I have\r\nsaid, was presented to the King on the 3d of September, 1791.  The\r\nministers, with the exception of M. de Montmorin, insisted upon the\r\nnecessity of accepting the constitutional act in its entirety.  The Prince\r\nde Kaunitz--[Minister of Austria]--was of the same opinion. Malouet wished\r\nthe King to express himself candidly respecting any errors or dangers that\r\nhe might observe in the constitution.  But Duport and Barnave, alarmed at\r\nthe spirit prevailing in the Jacobin Club, and even in the Assembly,\r\nwhere Robespierre had already denounced them as traitors to the country,\r\nand dreading still greater evils, added their opinions to those of the\r\nmajority of the ministers and M. de Kaunitz; those who really desired\r\nthat the constitution should be maintained advised that it should not be\r\naccepted thus literally.\r\n\r\n[The extreme revolutionary party, so called from the club, originally\r\n“Breton,” then “Amis de la Constitution,” sitting at the convent of the\r\nDominicans (called in France Jacobins) of the Rue Saint Honore.]\r\n\r\nThe King seemed inclined to this advice; and this is one of the\r\nstrongest proofs of his sincerity.\r\n\r\nAlexandre Lameth, Duport, and Barnave, still relying on the resources of\r\ntheir party, hoped to have credit for directing the King through the\r\ninfluence they believed they had acquired over the mind of the Queen. They\r\nalso consulted people of acknowledged talent, but belonging to no council\r\nnor to any assembly.  Among these was M. Dubucq, formerly intendant of the\r\nmarine and of the colonies.  He answered laconically in one phrase:\r\n“Prevent disorder from organising itself.”\r\n\r\nThe letter written by the King to the Assembly, claiming to accept the\r\nconstitution in the very place where it had been created, and where he\r\nannounced he would be on the 14th September at mid-day, was received with\r\ntransport, and the reading was repeatedly interrupted by plaudits.  The\r\nsitting terminated amidst the greatest enthusiasm, and M. de La Fayette\r\nobtained the release of all those who were detained on account of the\r\nKing’s journey [to Varennes], the abandonment of all proceedings relative\r\nto the events of the Revolution, and the discontinuance of the use of\r\npassports and of temporary restraints upon free travelling, as well in the\r\ninterior as without.  The whole was conceded by acclamation.  Sixty\r\nmembers were deputed to go to the King and express to him fully the\r\nsatisfaction his Majesty’s letter had given.  The Keeper of the Seals\r\nquitted the chamber, in the midst of applause, to precede the deputation\r\nto the King.\r\n\r\nThe King answered the speech addressed to him, and concluded by saying to\r\nthe Assembly that a decree of that morning, which had abolished the order\r\nof the Holy Ghost, had left him and his son alone permission to be\r\ndecorated with it; but that an order having no value in his eyes, save for\r\nthe power of conferring it, he would not use it.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, her son, and Madame, were at the door of the chamber into which\r\nthe deputation was admitted.  The King said to the deputies, “You see\r\nthere my wife and children, who participate in my sentiments;” and the\r\nQueen herself confirmed the King’s assurance.  These apparent marks of\r\nconfidence were very inconsistent with the agitated state of her mind.\r\n“These people want no sovereigns,” said she.  “We shall fall before their\r\ntreacherous though well-planned tactics; they are demolishing the monarchy\r\nstone by stone.”\r\n\r\nNext day the particulars of the reception of the deputies by the King were\r\nreported to the Assembly, and excited warm approbation.  But the President\r\nhaving put the question whether the Assembly ought not to remain seated\r\nwhile the King took the oath “Certainly,” was repeated by many voices;\r\n“and the King, standing, uncovered.”  M. Malouet observed that there was\r\nno occasion on which the nation, assembled in the presence of the King,\r\ndid not acknowledge him as its head; that the omission to treat the head\r\nof the State with the respect due to him would be an offence to the\r\nnation, as well as to the monarch.  He moved that the King should take the\r\noath standing, and that the Assembly should also stand while he was doing\r\nso.  M. Malouet’s observations would have carried the decree, but a deputy\r\nfrom Brittany exclaimed, with a shrill voice, that he had an amendment to\r\npropose which would render all unanimous.  “Let us decree,” said he, “that\r\nM. Malouet, and whoever else shall so please, may have leave to receive\r\nthe King upon their knees; but let us stick to the decree.”\r\n\r\nThe King repaired to the chamber at mid-day.  His speech was followed by\r\nplaudits which lasted several minutes.  After the signing of the\r\nconstitutional act all sat down.  The President rose to deliver his\r\nspeech; but after he had begun, perceiving that the King did not rise to\r\nhear him, he sat down again.  His speech made a powerful impression; the\r\nsentence with which it concluded excited fresh acclamations, cries of\r\n“Bravo!” and “Vive le Roi!”--“Sire,” said he, “how important in our eyes,\r\nand how dear to our hearts--how sublime a feature in our history--must be\r\nthe epoch of that regeneration which gives citizens to France, and a\r\ncountry to Frenchmen,--to you, as a king, a new title of greatness and\r\nglory, and, as a man, a source of new enjoyment.”  The whole Assembly\r\naccompanied the King on his return, amidst the people’s cries of\r\nhappiness, military music, and salvoes of artillery.\r\n\r\nAt length I hoped to see a return of that tranquillity which had so long\r\nvanished from the countenances of my august master and mistress.  Their\r\nsuite left them in the salon; the Queen hastily saluted the ladies, and\r\nreturned much affected; the King followed her, and, throwing himself into\r\nan armchair, put his handkerchief to his eyes.  “Ah! Madame,” cried he,\r\nhis voice choked by tears, “why were you present at this sitting?  to\r\nwitness--” these words were interrupted by sobs.  The Queen threw herself\r\nupon her knees before him, and pressed him in her arms.  I remained with\r\nthem, not from any blamable curiosity, but from a stupefaction which\r\nrendered me incapable of determining what I ought to do.  The Queen said\r\nto me, “Oh! go, go!” with an accent which expressed, “Do not remain to see\r\nthe dejection and despair of your sovereign!”  I withdrew, struck with the\r\ncontrast between the shouts of joy without the palace and the profound\r\ngrief which oppressed the sovereigns within.  Half an hour afterwards the\r\nQueen sent for me.  She desired to see M. de Goguelat, to announce to him\r\nhis departure on that very night for Vienna.  The renewed attacks upon the\r\ndignity of the throne which had been made during the sitting; the spirit\r\nof an Assembly worse than the former; the monarch put upon a level with\r\nthe President, without any deference to the throne,--all this proclaimed\r\nbut too loudly that the sovereignty itself was aimed at.  The Queen no\r\nlonger saw any ground for hope from the Provinces. The King wrote to the\r\nEmperor; she told me that she would herself, at midnight, bring the letter\r\nwhich M. de Goguelat was to bear to the Emperor, to my room.\r\n\r\nDuring all the remainder of the day the Chateau and the Tuileries were\r\ncrowded; the illuminations were magnificent.  The King and Queen were\r\nrequested to take an airing in their carriage in the Champs-Elysees,\r\nescorted by the aides-decamp, and leaders of the Parisian army, the\r\nConstitutional Guard not being at the time organised.  Many shouts of\r\n“Vive le Roi!”  were heard; but as often as they ceased, one of the mob,\r\nwho never quitted the door of the King’s carriage for a single instant,\r\nexclaimed with a stentorian voice, “No, don’t believe them!  Vive la\r\nNation!”  This ill-omened cry struck terror into the Queen.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards M. de Montmorin sent to say he wanted to speak to\r\nme; that he would come to me, if he were not apprehensive his doing so\r\nwould attract observation; and that he thought it would appear less\r\nconspicuous if he should see me in the Queen’s great closet at a time\r\nwhich he specified, and when nobody would be there.  I went.  After having\r\nmade some polite observations upon the services I had already performed,\r\nand those I might yet perform, for my master and mistress, he spoke to me\r\nof the King’s imminent danger, of the plots which were hatching, and of\r\nthe lamentable composition of the Legislative Assembly; and he\r\nparticularly dwelt upon the necessity of appearing, by prudent remarks,\r\ndetermined as much as possible to abide by the act the King had just\r\nrecognised.  I told him that could not be done without committing\r\nourselves in the eyes of the royalist party, with which moderation was a\r\ncrime; that it was painful to hear ourselves taxed with being\r\nconstitutionalists, at the same time that it was our opinion that the only\r\nconstitution which was consistent with the King’s honour, and the\r\nhappiness and tranquillity of his people, was the absolute power of the\r\nsovereign; that this was my creed, and it would pain me to give any room\r\nfor suspicion that I was wavering in it.\r\n\r\n“Could you ever believe,” said he, “that I should desire any other order\r\nof things?  Have you any doubt of my attachment to the King’s person, and\r\nthe maintenance of his rights?”\r\n\r\n“I know it, Count,” replied I; “but you are not ignorant that you lie\r\nunder the imputation of having adopted revolutionary ideas.”\r\n\r\n“Well, madame, have resolution enough to dissemble and to conceal your\r\nreal sentiments; dissimulation was never more necessary.  Endeavours are\r\nbeing made to paralyse the evil intentions of the factious as much as\r\npossible; but we must not be counteracted here by certain dangerous\r\nexpressions which are circulated in Paris as coming from the King and\r\nQueen.”\r\n\r\nI told him that I had been already struck with apprehension of the evil\r\nwhich might be done by the intemperate observations of persons who had no\r\npower to act; and that I had felt ill consequences from having repeatedly\r\nenjoined silence on those in the Queen’s service.\r\n\r\n“I know that,” said the Count; “the Queen informed me of it, and that\r\ndetermined me to come and request you to increase and keep alive, as much\r\nas you can, that spirit of discretion which is so necessary.”\r\n\r\nWhile the household of the King and Queen were a prey to all these fears,\r\nthe festivities in celebration of the acceptance of the constitution\r\nproceeded.  Their Majesties went to the Opera; the audience consisted\r\nentirely of persons who sided with the King, and on that day the happiness\r\nof seeing him for a short time surrounded by faithful subjects might be\r\nenjoyed.  The acclamations were then sincere.\r\n\r\n“La Coquette Corrigee” had been selected for representation at the Theatre\r\nFrancais solely because it was the piece in which Mademoiselle Contat\r\nshone most.  Yet the notions propagated by the Queen’s enemies coinciding\r\nin my mind with the name of the play, I thought the choice very\r\nill-judged.  I was at a loss, however, how to tell her Majesty so; but\r\nsincere attachment gives courage.  I explained myself; she was obliged to\r\nme, and desired that another play might be performed.  They accordingly\r\nselected “La Gouvernante,” almost equally unfortunate in title.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, Madame the King’s daughter, and Madame Elisabeth were all well\r\nreceived on this occasion.  It is true that the opinions and feelings of\r\nthe spectators in the boxes could not be otherwise than favourable, and\r\ngreat pains had been taken, previously to these two performances, to fill\r\nthe pit with proper persons.  But, on the other hand, the Jacobins took\r\nthe same precautions on their side at the Theatre Italien, and the tumult\r\nwas excessive there.  The play was Gretry’s “Les Evenements Imprevus.”\r\n Unfortunately, Madame Dugazon thought proper to bow to the Queen as she\r\nsang the words, “Ah, how I love my mistress!” in a duet.  Above twenty\r\nvoices immediately exclaimed from the pit, “No mistress!  no master!\r\nliberty!”  A few replied from the boxes and slips, “Vive le Roi!  vive la\r\nReine!”  Those in the pit answered, “No master! no Queen!” The quarrel\r\nincreased; the pit formed into parties; they began fighting, and the\r\nJacobins were beaten; tufts of their black hair flew about the\r\ntheatre.--[At this time none but the Jacobins had discontinued the use of\r\nhairpowder.--MADAME CAMPAN.]--A military guard arrived.  The Faubourg St.\r\nAntoine, hearing of what was going on at the Theatre Italien, flocked\r\ntogether, and began to talk of marching towards the scene of action.  The\r\nQueen preserved the calmest demeanour; the commandants of the guard\r\nsurrounded and encouraged her; they conducted themselves promptly and\r\ndiscreetly.  No accident happened.  The Queen was highly applauded as she\r\nquitted the theatre; it was the last time she was ever in one!\r\n\r\nWhile couriers were bearing confidential letters from the King to the\r\nPrinces, his brothers, and to the foreign sovereigns, the Assembly invited\r\nhim to write to the Princes in order to induce them to return to France.\r\nThe King desired the Abbe de Montesquiou to write the letter he was to\r\nsend; this letter, which was admirably composed in a simple and affecting\r\nstyle, suited to the character of Louis XVI., and filled with very\r\npowerful arguments in favour of the advantages to be derived from adopting\r\nthe principles of the constitution, was confided to me by the King, who\r\ndesired me to make him a copy of it.\r\n\r\nAt this period M. M-----, one of the intendants of Monsieur’s household,\r\nobtained a passport from the Assembly to join that Prince on business\r\nrelative to his domestic concerns.  The Queen selected him to be the\r\nbearer of this letter.  She determined to give it to him herself, and to\r\ninform him of its object.  I was astonished at her choice of this courier.\r\nThe Queen assured me he was exactly the man for her purpose, that she\r\nrelied even upon his indiscretion, and that it was merely necessary that\r\nthe letter from the King to his brothers should be known to exist.  The\r\nPrinces were doubtless informed beforehand on the subject by the private\r\ncorrespondence.  Monsieur nevertheless manifested some degree of surprise,\r\nand the messenger returned more grieved than pleased at this mark of\r\nconfidence, which nearly cost him his life during the Reign of Terror.\r\n\r\nAmong the causes of uneasiness to the Queen there was one which was but\r\ntoo well founded, the thoughtlessness of the French whom she sent to\r\nforeign Courts.  She used to say that they had no sooner passed the\r\nfrontiers than they disclosed the most secret matters relative to the\r\nKing’s private sentiments, and that the leaders of the Revolution were\r\ninformed of them through their agents, many of whom were Frenchmen who\r\npassed themselves off as emigrants in the cause of their King.\r\n\r\nAfter the acceptance of the constitution, the formation of the King’s\r\nhousehold, as well military as civil, formed a subject of attention. The\r\nDuc de Brissac had the command of the Constitutional Guard, which was\r\ncomposed of officers and men selected from the regiments, and of several\r\nofficers drawn from the National Guard of Paris.  The King was satisfied\r\nwith the feelings and conduct of this band, which, as is well known,\r\nexisted but a very short time.\r\n\r\nThe new constitution abolished what were called honours, and the\r\nprerogatives belonging to them.  The Duchesse de Duras resigned her place\r\nof lady of the bedchamber, not choosing to lose her right to the tabouret\r\nat Court.  This step hurt the Queen, who saw herself forsaken through the\r\nloss of a petty privilege at a time when her own rights and even life were\r\nso hotly attacked.  Many ladies of rank left the Court for the same\r\nreason.  However, the King and Queen did not dare to form the civil part\r\nof their household, lest by giving the new names of the posts they should\r\nacknowledge the abolition of the old ones, and also lest they should admit\r\ninto the highest positions persons not calculated to fill them well.  Some\r\ntime was spent in discussing the question, whether the household should be\r\nformed without chevaliers and without ladies of honour.  The Queen’s\r\nconstitutional advisers were of opinion that the Assembly, having decreed\r\na civil list adequate to uphold the splendour of the throne, would be\r\ndissatisfied at seeing the King adopting only a military household, and\r\nnot forming his civil household upon the new constitutional plan.  “How is\r\nit, Madame,” wrote Barnave to the Queen, “that you will persist in giving\r\nthese people even the smallest doubt as to your sentiments?  When they\r\ndecree you a civil and a military household, you, like young Achilles\r\namong the daughters of Lycomedes, eagerly seize the sword and scorn the\r\nmere ornaments.”  The Queen persisted in her determination to have no\r\ncivil household.  “If,” said she, “this constitutional household be\r\nformed, not a single person of rank will remain with us, and upon a change\r\nof affairs we should be obliged to discharge the persons received into\r\ntheir place.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” added she, “perhaps I might find one day that I had saved the\r\nnobility, if I now had resolution enough to afflict them for a time; I\r\nhave it not.  When any measure which injures them is wrested from us they\r\nsulk with me; nobody comes to my card party; the King goes unattended to\r\nbed.  No allowance is made for political necessity; we are punished for\r\nour very misfortunes.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen wrote almost all day, and spent part of the night in reading:\r\nher courage supported her physical strength; her disposition was not at\r\nall soured by misfortunes, and she was never seen in an ill-humour for a\r\nmoment.  She was, however, held up to the people as a woman absolutely\r\nfurious and mad whenever the rights of the Crown were in any way attacked.\r\n\r\nI was with her one day at one of her windows.  We saw a man plainly\r\ndressed, like an ecclesiastic, surrounded by an immense crowd.  The Queen\r\nimagined it was some abbe whom they were about to throw into the basin of\r\nthe Tuileries; she hastily opened her window and sent a valet de chambre\r\nto know what was going forward in the garden.  It was Abbe Gregoire, whom\r\nthe men and women of the tribunes were bringing back in triumph, on\r\naccount of a motion he had just made in the National Assembly against the\r\nroyal authority.  On the following day the democratic journalists\r\ndescribed the Queen as witnessing this triumph, and showing, by expressive\r\ngestures at her window, how highly she was exasperated by the honours\r\nconferred upon the patriot.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between the Queen and the foreign powers was carried on\r\nin cipher.  That to which she gave the preference can never be detected;\r\nbut the greatest patience is requisite for its use.  Each correspondent\r\nmust have a copy of the same edition of some work.  She selected “Paul and\r\nVirginia.”  The page and line in which the letters required, and\r\noccasionally a monosyllable, are to be found are pointed out in ciphers\r\nagreed upon.  I assisted her in finding the letters, and frequently I made\r\nan exact copy for her of all that she had ciphered, without knowing a\r\nsingle word of its meaning.\r\n\r\nThere were always several secret committees in Paris occupied in\r\ncollecting information for the King respecting the measures of the\r\nfactions, and in influencing some of the committees of the Assembly. M.\r\nBertrand de Molleville was in close correspondence with the Queen. The\r\nKing employed M. Talon and others; much money was expended through the\r\nlatter channel for the secret measures.  The Queen had no confidence in\r\nthem.  M. de Laporte, minister of the civil list and of the household,\r\nalso attempted to give a bias to public opinion by means of hireling\r\npublications; but these papers influenced none but the royalist party,\r\nwhich did not need influencing.  M. de Laporte had a private police which\r\ngave him some useful information.\r\n\r\nI determined to sacrifice myself to my duty, but by no means to any\r\nintrigue, and I thought that, circumstanced as I was, I ought to confine\r\nmyself to obeying the Queen’s orders.  I frequently sent off couriers to\r\nforeign countries, and they were never discovered, so many precautions did\r\nI take.  I am indebted for the preservation of my own existence to the\r\ncare I took never to admit any deputy to my abode, and to refuse all\r\ninterviews which even people of the highest importance often requested of\r\nme; but this line of conduct exposed me to every species of ill-will, and\r\non the same day I saw myself denounced by Prud’homme, in his ‘Gazette\r\nRevolutionnaire’, as capable of making an aristocrat of the mother of the\r\nGracchi, if a person so dangerous as myself could have got into her\r\nhousehold; and by Gauthier’s Gazette Royaliste, as a monarchist, a\r\nconstitutionalist, more dangerous to the Queen’s interests than a Jacobin.\r\n\r\nAt this period an event with which I had nothing to do placed me in a\r\nstill more critical situation.  My brother, M. Genet, began his diplomatic\r\ncareer successfully.  At eighteen he was attached to the embassy to\r\nVienna; at twenty he was appointed chief secretary of Legation in England,\r\non occasion of the peace of 1783.  A memorial which he presented to M. de\r\nVergennes upon the dangers of the treaty of commerce then entered into\r\nwith England gave offence to M. de Calonne, a patron of that treaty, and\r\nparticularly to M. Gerard de Rayneval, chief clerk for foreign affairs.\r\nSo long as M. de Vergennes lived, having upon my father’s death declared\r\nhimself the protector of my brother, he supported him against the enemies\r\nhis views had created.  But on his death M. de Montmorin, being much in\r\nneed of the long experience in business which he found in M. de Rayneval,\r\nwas guided solely by the latter.  The office of which my brother was the\r\nhead was suppressed.  He then went to St. Petersburg, strongly recommended\r\nto the Comte de Segur, minister from France to that Court, who appointed\r\nhim secretary of Legation.  Some time afterwards the Comte de Segur left\r\nhim at St. Petersburg, charged with the affairs of France.  After his\r\nreturn from Russia, M. Genet was appointed ambassador to the United States\r\nby the party called Girondists, the deputies who headed it being from the\r\ndepartment of the Gironde.  He was recalled by the Robespierre party,\r\nwhich overthrew the former faction, on the 31st of May, 1793, and\r\ncondemned to appear before the Convention.  Vice-President Clinton, at\r\nthat time Governor of New York, offered him an asylum in his house and the\r\nhand of his daughter, and M. Genet established himself prosperously in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nWhen my brother quitted Versailles he was much hurt at being deprived of a\r\nconsiderable income for having penned a memorial which his zeal alone had\r\ndictated, and the importance of which was afterwards but too well\r\nunderstood.  I perceived from his correspondence that he inclined to some\r\nof the new notions.  He told me it was right he should no longer conceal\r\nfrom me that he sided with the constitutional party; that the King had in\r\nfact commanded it, having himself accepted the constitution; that he would\r\nproceed firmly in that course, because in this case disingenuousness would\r\nbe fatal, and that he took that side of the question because he had had it\r\nproved to him that the foreign powers would not serve the King’s cause\r\nwithout advancing pretensions prompted by long-standing interests, which\r\nalways would influence their councils; that he saw no salvation for the\r\nKing and Queen but from within France, and that he would serve the\r\nconstitutional King as he served him before the Revolution.  And lastly,\r\nhe requested me to impart to the Queen the real sentiments of one of his\r\nMajesty’s agents at a foreign Court.  I immediately went to the Queen and\r\ngave her my brother’s letter; she read it attentively, and said, “This is\r\nthe letter of a young man led astray by discontent and ambition; I know\r\nyou do not think as he does; do not fear that you will lose the confidence\r\nof the King and myself.”  I offered to discontinue all correspondence with\r\nmy brother; she opposed that, saying it would be dangerous.  I then\r\nentreated she would permit me in future to show her my own and my\r\nbrother’s letters, to which she consented.  I wrote warmly to my brother\r\nagainst the course he had adopted.  I sent my letters by sure channels; he\r\nanswered me by the post, and no longer touched upon anything but family\r\naffairs.  Once only he informed me that if I should write to him\r\nrespecting the affairs of the day he would give me no answer.  “Serve your\r\naugust mistress with the unbounded devotion which is due from you,” said\r\nhe, “and let us each do our duty.  I will only observe to you that at\r\nParis the fogs of the Seine often prevent people from seeing that immense\r\ncapital, even from the Pavilion of Flora, and I see it more clearly from\r\nSt. Petersburg.” The Queen said, as she read this letter, “Perhaps he\r\nspeaks but too truly; who can decide upon so disastrous a position as ours\r\nhas become?” The day on which I gave the Queen my brother’s first letter\r\nto read she had several audiences to give to ladies and other persons\r\nbelonging to the Court, who came on purpose to inform her that my brother\r\nwas an avowed constitutionalist and revolutionist.  The Queen replied, “I\r\nknow it; Madame Campan has told me so.”  Persons jealous of my situation\r\nhaving subjected me to mortifications, and these unpleasant circumstances\r\nrecurring daily, I requested the Queen’s permission to withdraw from\r\nCourt.  She exclaimed against the very idea, represented it to me as\r\nextremely dangerous for my own reputation, and had the kindness to add\r\nthat, for my sake as well as for her own, she never would consent to it.\r\nAfter this conversation I retired to my apartment.  A few minutes later a\r\nfootman brought me this note from the Queen: “I have never ceased to give\r\nyou and yours proofs of my attachment; I wish to tell you in writing that\r\nI have full faith in your honour and fidelity, as well as in your other\r\ngood qualities; and that I ever rely on the zeal and address you exert to\r\nserve me.”\r\n\r\n[I had just received this letter from the Queen when M. de la Chapelle,\r\ncommissary-general of the King’s household, and head of the offices of M.\r\nde Laporte, minister of the civil list, came to see me.  The palace having\r\nbeen already sacked by the brigands on the 20th of June, 1792, he proposed\r\nthat I should entrust the paper to him, that he might place it in a safer\r\nsituation than the apartments of the Queen.  When he returned into his\r\noffices he placed the letter she had condescended to write to me behind a\r\nlarge picture in his closet; but on the loth of August M. de la Chapelle\r\nwas thrown into the prisons of the Abbaye, and the committee of public\r\nsafety established themselves in his offices, whence they issued all their\r\ndecrees of death.  There it was that a villainous servant belonging to M.\r\nde Laporte went to declare that in the minister’s apartments, under a\r\nboard in the floor, a number of papers would be found.  They were brought\r\nforth, and M. de Laporte was sent to the scaffold, where he suffered for\r\nhaving betrayed the State by serving his master and sovereign.  M. de la\r\nChapelle was saved, as if by a miracle, from the massacres of the 2d of\r\nSeptember.  The committee of public safety having removed to the King’s\r\napartments at the Tuileries, M. de la Chapelle had permission to return to\r\nhis closet to take away some property belonging to him. Turning round the\r\npicture, behind which he had hidden the Queen’s letter, he found it in the\r\nplace into which he had slipped it, and, delighted to see that I was safe\r\nfrom the ill consequences the discovery of this paper might have brought\r\nupon me, he burnt it instantly.  In times of danger a mere nothing may\r\nsave life or destroy it.--MADAME CAMPAN]\r\n\r\nAt the moment that I was going to express my gratitude to the Queen I\r\nheard a tapping at the door of my room, which opened upon the Queen’s\r\ninner corridor.  I opened it; it was the King.  I was confused; he\r\nperceived it, and said to me, kindly: “I alarm you, Madame Campan; I come,\r\nhowever, to comfort you; the Queen has told me how much she is hurt at the\r\ninjustice of several persons towards you.  But how is it that you complain\r\nof injustice and calumny when you see that we are victims of them?  In\r\nsome of your companions it is jealousy; in the people belonging to the\r\nCourt it is anxiety.  Our situation is so disastrous, and we have met with\r\nso much ingratitude and treachery, that the apprehensions of those who\r\nlove us are excusable!  I could quiet them by telling them all the secret\r\nservices you perform for us daily; but I will not do it.  Out of good-will\r\nto you they would repeat all I should say, and you would be lost with the\r\nAssembly.  It is much better, both for you and for us, that you should be\r\nthought a constitutionalist.  It has been mentioned to me a hundred times\r\nalready; I have never contradicted it; but I come to give you my word that\r\nif we are fortunate enough to see an end of all this, I will, at the\r\nQueen’s residence, and in the presence of my brothers, relate the\r\nimportant services you have rendered us, and I will recompense you and\r\nyour son for them.”  I threw myself at the King’s feet and kissed his\r\nhand.  He raised me up, saying, “Come, come, do not grieve; the Queen, who\r\nloves you, confides in you as I do.”\r\n\r\nDown to the day of the acceptance it was impossible to introduce Barnave\r\ninto the interior of the palace; but when the Queen was free from the\r\ninner guard she said she would see him.  The very great precautions which\r\nit was necessary for the deputy to take in order to conceal his connection\r\nwith the King and Queen compelled them to spend two hours waiting for him\r\nin one of the corridors of the Tuileries, and all in vain.  The first day\r\nthat he was to be admitted, a man whom Barnave knew to be dangerous having\r\nmet him in the courtyard of the palace, he determined to cross it without\r\nstopping, and walked in the gardens in order to lull suspicion.  I was\r\ndesired to wait for Barnave at a little door belonging to the entresols of\r\nthe palace, with my hand upon the open lock.  I was in that position for\r\nan hour.  The King came to me frequently, and always to speak to me of the\r\nuneasiness which a servant belonging to the Chateau, who was a patriot,\r\ngave him.  He came again to ask me whether I had heard the door called de\r\nDecret opened.  I assured him nobody had been in the corridor, and he\r\nbecame easy.  He was dreadfully apprehensive that his connection with\r\nBarnave would be discovered.  “It would,” said the King, “be a ground for\r\ngrave accusations, and the unfortunate man would be lost.”  I then\r\nventured to remind his Majesty that as Barnave was not the only one in the\r\nsecret of the business which brought him in contact with their Majesties,\r\none of his colleagues might be induced to speak of the association with\r\nwhich they were honoured, and that in letting them know by my presence\r\nthat I also was informed of it, a risk was incurred of removing from those\r\ngentlemen part of the responsibility of the secret.  Upon this observation\r\nthe King quitted me hastily and returned a moment afterwards with the\r\nQueen.  “Give me your place,” said she; “I will wait for him in my turn.\r\nYou have convinced the King.  We must not increase in their eyes the\r\nnumber of persons informed of their communications with us.”\r\n\r\nThe police of M. de Laporte, intendant of the civil list, apprised him, as\r\nearly as the latter end of 1791, that a man belonging to the King’s\r\noffices who had set up as a pastrycook at the Palais Royal was about to\r\nresume the duties of his situation, which had devolved upon him again on\r\nthe death of one who held it for life; that he was so furious a Jacobin\r\nthat he had dared to say it would be a good thing for France if the King’s\r\ndays were shortened.  His duty was confined to making the pastry; he was\r\nclosely watched by the head officers of the kitchen, who were devoted to\r\nhis Majesty; but it is so easy to introduce a subtle poison into made\r\ndishes that it was determined the King and Queen should eat only plain\r\nroast meat in future; that their bread should be brought to them by M.\r\nThierry de Ville-d’Avray, intendant of the smaller apartments, and that he\r\nshould likewise take upon himself to supply the wine.  The King was fond\r\nof pastry; I was directed to order some, as if for myself, sometimes of\r\none pastry-cook, and sometimes of another.  The pounded sugar, too, was\r\nkept in my room.  The King, the Queen, and Madame Elisabeth ate together,\r\nand nobody remained to wait on them.  Each had a dumb waiter and a little\r\nbell to call the servants when they were wanted. M. Thierry used himself\r\nto bring me their Majesties’ bread and wine, and I locked them up in a\r\nprivate cupboard in the King’s closet on the ground floor.  As soon as the\r\nKing sat down to table I took in the pastry and bread.  All was hidden\r\nunder the table lest it might be necessary to have the servants in.  The\r\nKing thought it dangerous as well as distressing to show any apprehension\r\nof attempts against his person, or any mistrust of his officers of the\r\nkitchen.  As he never drank a whole bottle of wine at his meals (the\r\nPrincesses drank nothing but water), he filled up that out of which he had\r\ndrunk about half from the bottle served up by the officers of his butlery.\r\nI took it away after dinner.  Although he never ate any other pastry than\r\nthat which I brought, he took care in the same manner that it should seem\r\nthat he had eaten of that served at table. The lady who succeeded me found\r\nthis duty all regulated, and she executed it in the same manner; the\r\npublic never was in possession of these particulars, nor of the\r\napprehensions which gave rise to them.  At the end of three or four months\r\nthe police of M. de Laporte gave notice that nothing more was to be\r\ndreaded from that sort of plot against the King’s life; that the plan was\r\nentirely changed; and that all the blows now to be struck would be\r\ndirected as much against the throne as against the person of the\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nThere are others besides myself who know that at this time one of the\r\nthings about which the Queen most desired to be satisfied was the opinion\r\nof the famous Pitt.  She would sometimes say to me, “I never pronounce the\r\nname of Pitt without feeling a chill like that of death.”  (I repeat here\r\nher very expressions.) “That man is the mortal enemy of France; and he\r\ntakes a dreadful revenge for the impolitic support given by the Cabinet of\r\nVersailles to the American insurgents.  He wishes by our destruction to\r\nguarantee the maritime power of his country forever against the efforts\r\nmade by the King to improve his marine power and their happy results\r\nduring the last war.  He knows that it is not only the King’s policy but\r\nhis private inclination to be solicitous about his fleets, and that the\r\nmost active step he has taken during his whole reign was to visit the port\r\nof Cherbourg.  Pitt had served the cause of the French Revolution from the\r\nfirst disturbances; he will perhaps serve it until its annihilation.  I\r\nwill endeavour to learn to what point he intends to lead us, and I am\r\nsending M.----- to London for that purpose. He has been intimately\r\nconnected with Pitt, and they have often had political conversations\r\nrespecting the French Government.  I will get him to make him speak out,\r\nat least so far as such a man can speak out.” Some time afterwards the\r\nQueen told me that her secret envoy was returned from London, and that all\r\nhe had been able to wring from Pitt, whom he found alarmingly reserved,\r\nwas that he would not suffer the French monarchy to perish; that to suffer\r\nthe revolutionary spirit to erect an organised republic in France would be\r\na great error, affecting the tranquillity of Europe.  “Whenever,” said\r\nshe, “Pitt expressed himself upon the necessity of supporting monarchy in\r\nFrance, he maintained the most profound silence upon what concerns the\r\nmonarch.  The result of these conversations is anything but encouraging;\r\nbut, even as to that monarchy which he wishes to save, will he have means\r\nand strength to save it if he suffers us to fall?”\r\n\r\nThe death of the Emperor Leopold took place on the 1st of March, 1792.\r\nWhen the news of this event reached the Tuileries, the Queen was gone out.\r\nUpon her return I put the letter containing it into her hands.  She\r\nexclaimed that the Emperor had been poisoned; that she had remarked and\r\npreserved a newspaper, in which, in an article upon the sitting of the\r\nJacobins, at the time when the Emperor Leopold declared for the coalition,\r\nit was said, speaking of him, that a pie-crust would settle that matter.\r\nAt this period Barnave obtained the Queen’s consent that he should read\r\nall the letters she should write.  He was fearful of private\r\ncorrespondences that might hamper the plan marked out for her; he\r\nmistrusted her Majesty’s sincerity on this point; and the diversity of\r\ncounsels, and the necessity of yielding, on the one hand, to some of the\r\nviews of the constitutionalists, and on the other, to those of the French\r\nPrinces, and even of foreign Courts, were unfortunately the circumstances\r\nwhich most rapidly impelled the Court towards its ruin.\r\n\r\nHowever, the emigrants showed great apprehensions of the consequences\r\nwhich might follow in the interior from a connection with the\r\nconstitutionalists, whom they described as a party existing only in idea,\r\nand totally without means of repairing their errors.  The Jacobins were\r\npreferred to them, because, said they, there would be no treaty to be made\r\nwith any one at the moment of extricating the King and his family from the\r\nabyss in which they were plunged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1792, a worthy priest requested a private\r\ninterview with me.  He had learned the existence of a new libel by Madame\r\nde Lamotte.  He told me that the people who came from London to get it\r\nprinted in Paris only desired gain, and that they were ready to deliver\r\nthe manuscript to him for a thousand louis, if he could find any friend of\r\nthe Queen disposed to make that sacrifice for her peace; that he had\r\nthought of me, and if her Majesty would give him the twenty-four thousand\r\nfrancs, he would hand the manuscript to me.\r\n\r\nI communicated this proposal to the Queen, who rejected it, and desired me\r\nto answer that at the time when she had power to punish the hawkers of\r\nthese libels she deemed them so atrocious and incredible that she despised\r\nthem too much to stop them; that if she were imprudent and weak enough to\r\nbuy a single one of them, the Jacobins might possibly discover the\r\ncircumstance through their espionage; that were this libel brought up, it\r\nwould be printed nevertheless, and would be much more dangerous when they\r\napprised the public of the means she had used to suppress it.\r\n\r\nBaron d’Aubier, gentleman-in-ordinary to the King, and my particular\r\nfriend, had a good memory and a clear way of communicating the substance\r\nof the debates and decrees of the National Assembly.  I went daily to the\r\nQueen’s apartments to repeat all this to the King, who used to say, on\r\nseeing me, “Ah! here’s the Postillon par Calais,”--a newspaper of the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nM. d’Aubier one day said to me: “The Assembly has been much occupied with\r\nan information laid by the workmen of the Sevres manufactory.  They\r\nbrought to the President’s office a bundle of pamphlets which they said\r\nwere the life of Marie Antoinette.  The director of the manufactory was\r\nordered up to the bar, and declared he had received orders to burn the\r\nprinted sheets in question in the furnaces used for baking his china.”\r\n\r\nWhile I was relating this business to the Queen the King coloured and held\r\nhis head down over his plate.  The Queen said to him, “Do you know\r\nanything about this, Sire?”  The King made no answer.  Madame Elisabeth\r\nrequested him to explain what it meant.  Louis was still silent.  I\r\nwithdrew hastily.  A few minutes afterwards the Queen came to my room and\r\ninformed me that the King, out of regard for her, had purchased the whole\r\nedition struck off from the manuscript which I had mentioned to her, and\r\nthat M. de Laporte had not been able to devise any more secret way of\r\ndestroying the work than that of having it burnt at Sevres, among two\r\nhundred workmen, one hundred and eighty of whom must, in all probability,\r\nbe Jacobins!  She told me she had concealed her vexation from the King;\r\nthat he was in consternation, and that she could say nothing, since his\r\ngood intentions and his affection for her had been the cause of the\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\n[M. de Laporte had by order of the King bought up the whole edition of the\r\n“Memoirs” of the notorious Madame de Lamotte against the Queen.  Instead\r\nof destroying them immediately, he shut them up in one of the closets in\r\nhis house, The alarming and rapid growth of the rebellion, the arrogance\r\nof the crowd of brigands, who in great measure composed the populace of\r\nParis, and the fresh excesses daily resulting from it, rendered the\r\nintendant of the civil list apprehensive that some mob might break into\r\nhis house, carry off these “Memoirs,” and spread them among the public.\r\nIn order to prevent this he gave orders to have the “Memoirs” burnt with\r\nevery necessary precaution; and the clerk who received the order entrusted\r\nthe execution of it to a man named Riston, a dangerous Intriguer, formerly\r\nan advocate of Nancy, who had a twelve-month before escaped the gallows by\r\nfavour of the new principles and the patriotism of the new tribunals,\r\nalthough convicted of forging the great seal, and fabricating decrees of\r\nthe council.  This Riston, finding himself entrusted with a commission\r\nwhich concerned her Majesty, and the mystery attending which bespoke\r\nsomething of importance, was less anxious to execute it faithfully than to\r\nmake a parade of this mark of confidence.  On the 30th of May, at ten in\r\nthe morning, he had the sheets carried to the porcelain manufactory at\r\nSevres, in a cart which he himself accompanied, and made a large fire of\r\nthem before all the workmen, who were expressly forbidden to approach it.\r\nAll these precautions, and the suspicions to which they gave rise, under\r\nsuch critical circumstances, gave so much publicity to this affair that it\r\nwas denounced to the Assembly that very night.  Brissot, and the whole\r\nJacobin party, with equal effrontery and vehemence, insisted that the\r\npapers thus secretly burnt could be no other than the registers and\r\ndocuments of the correspondence of the Austrian committee.  M. de Laporte\r\nwas ordered to the bar, and there gave the most precise account of the\r\ncircumstances.  Riston was also called up, and confirmed M. de Laporte’s\r\ndeposition.  But these explanations, however satisfactory, did not calm\r\nthe violent ferment raised in the Assembly by this affair.--“Memoirs of\r\nBertrand de Molleville.”]\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards the Assembly received a denunciation against M. de\r\nMontmorin.  The ex-minister was accused of having neglected forty\r\ndespatches from M. Genet, the charge d’affaires from France in Russia, not\r\nhaving even unsealed them, because M. Genet acted on constitutional\r\nprinciples.  M. de Montmorin appeared at the bar to answer this\r\naccusation.  Whatever distress I might feel in obeying the order I had\r\nreceived from the King to go and give him an account of the sitting, I\r\nthought I ought not to fail in doing so.  But instead of giving my brother\r\nhis family name, I merely said “your Majesty’s charge d’affaires at St.\r\nPetersburg.”\r\n\r\nThe King did me the favour to say that he noticed a reserve in my account,\r\nof which he approved.  The Queen condescended to add a few obliging\r\nremarks to those of the King.  However, my office of journalist gave me in\r\nthis instance so much pain that I took an opportunity, when the King was\r\nexpressing his satisfaction to me at the manner in which I gave him this\r\ndaily account, to tell him that its merits belonged wholly to M. d’Aubier;\r\nand I ventured to request the King to suffer that excellent man to give\r\nhim an account of the sittings himself.  I assured the King that if he\r\nwould permit it, that gentleman might proceed to the Queen’s apartments\r\nthrough mine unseen; the King consented to the arrangement.  Thenceforward\r\nM. d’Aubier gave the King repeated proofs of zeal and attachment.\r\n\r\nThe Cure of St. Eustache ceased to be the Queen’s confessor when he took\r\nthe constitutional oath.  I do not remember the name of the ecclesiastic\r\nwho succeeded him; I only know that he was conducted into her apartments\r\nwith the greatest mystery.  Their Majesties did not perform their Easter\r\ndevotions in public, because they could neither declare for the\r\nconstitutional clergy, nor act so as to show that they were against them.\r\n\r\nThe Queen did perform her Easter devotions in 1792; but she went to the\r\nchapel attended only by myself.  She desired me beforehand to request one\r\nof my relations, who was her chaplain, to celebrate a mass for her at five\r\no’clock in the morning.  It was still dark; she gave me her arm, and I\r\nlighted her with a taper.  I left her alone at the chapel door. She did\r\nnot return to her room until the dawn of day.\r\n\r\nDangers increased daily.  The Assembly were strengthened in the eyes of\r\nthe people by the hostilities of the foreign armies and the army of the\r\nPrinces.  The communication with the latter party became more active; the\r\nQueen wrote almost every day.  M. de Goguelat possessed her confidence for\r\nall correspondence with the foreign parties, and I was obliged to have him\r\nin my apartments; the Queen asked for him very frequently, and at times\r\nwhich she could not previously appoint.\r\n\r\nAll parties were exerting themselves either to ruin or to save the King.\r\nOne day I found the Queen extremely agitated; she told me she no longer\r\nknew where she was; that the leaders of the Jacobins offered themselves to\r\nher through the medium of Dumouriez; or that Dumouriez, abandoning the\r\nJacobins, had come and offered himself to her; that she had granted him an\r\naudience; that when alone with her, he had thrown himself at her feet, and\r\ntold her that he had drawn the ‘bonnet rouge’ over his head to the very\r\nears; but that he neither was nor could be a Jacobin; that the Revolution\r\nhad been suffered to extend even to that rabble of destroyers who,\r\nthinking of nothing but pillage, were ripe for anything, and might furnish\r\nthe Assembly with a formidable army, ready to undermine the remains of a\r\nthrone already but too much shaken.  Whilst speaking with the utmost\r\nardour he seized the Queen’s hand and kissed it with transport,\r\nexclaiming, “Suffer yourself to be saved!”  The Queen told me that the\r\nprotestations of a traitor were not to be relied on; that the whole of\r\nhis conduct was so well known that undoubtedly the wisest course was not\r\nto trust to it; that, moreover, the Princes particularly recommended\r\nthat no confidence should be placed in any proposition emanating from\r\nwithin the kingdom; that the force without became imposing; and that it\r\nwas better to rely upon their success, and upon the protection due from\r\nHeaven to a sovereign so virtuous as Louis XVI.  and to so just a cause.\r\n\r\n[The sincerity of General Dumouriez cannot be doubted in this instance.\r\nThe second volume of his Memoirs shows how unjust the mistrust and\r\nreproaches of the Queen were.  By rejecting his services, Marie Antoinette\r\ndeprived herself of her only remaining support.  He who saved France in\r\nthe defiles of Argonne would perhaps have saved France before the 20th of\r\nJune, had he obtained the full confidence of Louis XVI. and the\r\nQueen.--NOTE BY THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\nThe constitutionalists, on their part, saw that there had been nothing\r\nmore than a pretence of listening to them.  Barnave’s last advice was as\r\nto the means of continuing, a few weeks longer, the Constitutional Guard,\r\nwhich had been denounced to the Assembly, and was to be disbanded.  The\r\ndenunciation against the Constitutional Guard affected only its staff, and\r\nthe Duc de Brissac.  Barnave wrote to the Queen that the staff of the\r\nguard was already attacked; that the Assembly was about to pass a decree\r\nto reduce it; and he entreated her to prevail on the King, the very\r\ninstant the decree should appear, to form the staff afresh of persons\r\nwhose names he sent her.  Barnave said that all who were set down in it\r\npassed for decided Jacobins, but were not so in fact; that they, as well\r\nas himself, were in despair at seeing the monarchical government attacked;\r\nthat they had learnt to dissemble their sentiments, and that it would be\r\nat least a fortnight before the Assembly could know them well, and\r\ncertainly before it could succeed in making them unpopular; that it would\r\nbe necessary to take advantage of that short space of time to get away\r\nfrom Paris, immediately after their nomination.  The Queen was of opinion\r\nthat she ought not to yield to this advice.  The Duc de Brissac was sent\r\nto Orleans, and the guard was disbanded.\r\n\r\nBarnave, seeing that the Queen did not follow his counsel in anything, and\r\nconvinced that she placed all her reliance on assistance from abroad,\r\ndetermined to quit Paris.  He obtained a last audience.  “Your\r\nmisfortunes, Madame,” said he, “and those which I anticipate for France,\r\ndetermined me to sacrifice myself to serve you.  I see, however, that my\r\nadvice does not agree with the views of your Majesties.  I augur but\r\nlittle advantage from the plan you are induced to pursue,--you are too\r\nremote from your succours; you will be lost before they reach you.  Most\r\nardently do I wish I may be mistaken in so lamentable a prediction; but I\r\nam sure to pay with my head for the interest your misfortunes have raised\r\nin me, and the services I have sought to render you.  I request, for my\r\nsole reward, the honour of kissing your hand.”  The Queen, her eyes\r\nsuffused with tears, granted him that favour, and remained impressed with\r\na favourable idea of his sentiments.  Madame Elisabeth participated in\r\nthis opinion, and the two Princesses frequently spoke of Barnave.  The\r\nQueen also received M. Duport several times, but with less mystery.  Her\r\nconnection with the constitutional deputies transpired.  Alexandre de\r\nLameth was the only one of the three who survived the vengeance of the\r\nJacobins.\r\n\r\n[Barnave was arrested at Grenoble.  He remained in prison in that town\r\nfifteen months, and his friends began to hope that he would be forgotten,\r\nwhen an order arrived that he should be removed to Paris. At first he was\r\nimprisoned in the Abbaye, but transferred to the Conciergerie, and almost\r\nimmediately taken before the revolutionary tribunal.  He appeared there\r\nwith wonderful firmness, summed up the services he had rendered to the\r\ncause of liberty with his usual eloquence, and made such an impression\r\nupon the numerous auditors that, although accustomed to behold only\r\nconspirators worthy of death in all those who appeared before the\r\ntribunal, they themselves considered his acquittal certain.  The decree of\r\ndeath was read amidst the deepest silence; but Barnave’a firmness was\r\nimmovable. When he left the court, he cast upon the judges, the jurors,\r\nand the public looks expressive of contempt and indignation.  He was led\r\nto his fate with the respected Duport du Tertre, one of the last ministers\r\nof Louis XVI. when he had ascended the scaffold, Barnave stamped, raised\r\nhis eyes to heaven, and said: “This, then, is the reward of all that I\r\nhave done for liberty!”  He fell on the 29th of October, 1793, in the\r\nthirty-second year of his age; his bust was placed in the Grenoble Museum.\r\nThe Consular Government placed his statue next to that of Vergniaud, on\r\nthe great staircase of the palace of the Senate.--“Biographie de\r\nBruxelles.”]\r\n\r\nThe National Guard, which succeeded the King’s Guard, having occupied the\r\ngates of the Tuileries, all who came to see the Queen were insulted with\r\nimpunity.  Menacing cries were uttered aloud even in the Tuileries; they\r\ncalled for the destruction of the throne, and the murder of the sovereign;\r\nthe grossest insults were offered by the very lowest of the mob.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the King fell into a despondent state, which amounted\r\nalmost to physical helplessness.  He passed ten successive days without\r\nuttering a single word, even in the bosom of his family; except, indeed,\r\nwhen playing at backgammon after dinner with Madame Elisabeth.  The Queen\r\nroused him from this state, so fatal at a critical period, by throwing\r\nherself at his feet, urging every alarming idea, and employing every\r\naffectionate expression.  She represented also what he owed to his family;\r\nand told him that if they were doomed to fall they ought to fall\r\nhonourably, and not wait to be smothered upon the floor of their\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nAbout the 15th of June, 1792, the King refused his sanction to the two\r\ndecrees ordaining the deportation of priests and the formation of a camp\r\nof twenty thousand men under the walls of Paris.  He himself wished to\r\nsanction them, and said that the general insurrection only waited for a\r\npretence to burst forth.  The Queen insisted upon the veto, and reproached\r\nherself bitterly when this last act of the constitutional authority had\r\noccasioned the day of the 20th of June.\r\n\r\nA few days previously about twenty thousand men had gone to the Commune to\r\nannounce that, on the 20th, they would plant the tree of liberty at the\r\ndoor of the National Assembly, and present a petition to the King\r\nrespecting the veto which he had placed upon the decree for the\r\ndeportation of the priests.  This dreadful army crossed the garden of the\r\nTuileries, and marched under the Queen’s windows; it consisted of people\r\nwho called themselves the citizens of the Faubourgs St. Antoine and St.\r\nMarceau.  Clothed in filthy rags, they bore a most terrifying appearance,\r\nand even infected the air.  People asked each other where such an army\r\ncould come from; nothing so disgusting had ever before appeared in Paris.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of June this mob thronged about the Tuileries in still greater\r\nnumbers, armed with pikes, hatchets, and murderous instruments of all\r\nkinds, decorated with ribbons of the national colours, Shouting, “The\r\nnation for ever!  Down with the veto!”  The King was without guards. Some\r\nof these desperadoes rushed up to his apartment; the door was about to be\r\nforced in, when the King commanded that it should be opened. Messieurs de\r\nBougainville, d’Hervilly, de Parois, d’Aubier, Acloque, Gentil, and other\r\ncourageous men who were in the apartment of M. de Septeuil, the King’s\r\nfirst valet de chambre, instantly ran to his Majesty’s apartment.  M. de\r\nBougainville, seeing the torrent furiously advancing, cried out, “Put the\r\nKing in the recess of the window, and place benches before him.”  Six\r\nroyalist grenadiers of the battalion of the Filles Saint Thomas made their\r\nway by an inner staircase, and ranged themselves before the benches.  The\r\norder given by M. de Bougainville saved the King from the blades of the\r\nassassins, among whom was a Pole named Lazousky, who was to strike the\r\nfirst blow.  The King’s brave defenders said, “Sire, fear nothing.”  The\r\nKing’s reply is well known: “Put your hand upon my heart, and you will\r\nperceive whether I am afraid.” M. Vanot, commandant of battalion, warded\r\noff a blow aimed by a wretch against the King; a grenadier of the Filles\r\nSaint Thomas parried a sword-thrust made in the same direction.  Madame\r\nElisabeth ran to her brother’s apartments; when she reached the door she\r\nheard loud threats of death against the Queen: they called for the head of\r\nthe Austrian.  “Ah!  let them think I am the Queen,” she said to those\r\naround her, “that she may have time to escape.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen could not join the King; she was in the council chamber, where\r\nshe had been placed behind the great table to protect her, as much as\r\npossible, against the approach of the barbarians.  Preserving a noble and\r\nbecoming demeanour in this dreadful situation, she held the Dauphin before\r\nher, seated upon the table.  Madame was at her side; the Princesse de\r\nLamballe, the Princesse de Tarente, Madame de la Roche-Aymon, Madame de\r\nTourzel, and Madame de Mackau surrounded her.  She had fixed a tricoloured\r\ncockade, which one of the National Guard had given her, upon her head.\r\nThe poor little Dauphin was, like the King, shrouded in an enormous red\r\ncap.\r\n\r\n[One of the circumstances of the 20th of June which most vexed the King’s\r\nfriends being that of his wearing the bonnet rouge nearly three hours, I\r\nventured to ask him for some explanation of a fact so strikingly in\r\ncontrast with the extraordinary intrepidity shown by his Majesty during\r\nthat horrible day.  This was his answer: “The cries of ‘The nation for\r\never!’ violently increasing around me, and seeming to be addressed to me,\r\nI replied that the nation had not a warmer friend than myself.  Upon this\r\nan ill-looking man, making his way through the crowd, came up to me and\r\nsaid, rather roughly, ‘Well, if you speak the truth, prove it by putting\r\non this red cap.’ ‘I consent,’ replied I.  One or two of them immediately\r\ncame forward and placed the cap upon my hair, for it was too small for my\r\nhead. I was convinced, I knew not why, that his intention was merely to\r\nplace the cap upon my head for a moment, and then to take it off again;\r\nand I was so completely taken up with what was passing before me that I\r\ndid not feel whether the cap did or did not remain upon my hair.  I was so\r\nlittle aware of it that when I returned to my room I knew only from being\r\ntold so that it was still there.  I was very much surprised to find it\r\nupon my head, and was the more vexed at it because I might have taken it\r\noff immediately without the smallest difficulty.  But I am satisfied that\r\nif I had hesitated to consent to its being placed upon my head the drunken\r\nfellow who offered it to me would have thrust his pike into my\r\nstomach.”--“Memoirs of Bertrand de Molleville.”]\r\n\r\nThe horde passed in files before the table;the sort of standards which\r\nthey carried were symbols of the most atrocious barbarity.  There was\r\none representing a gibbet, to which a dirty doll was suspended; the\r\nwords “Marie Antoinette a la lanterne” were written beneath it.  Another\r\nwas a board, to which a bullock’s heart was fastened, with “Heart of\r\nLouis XVI.” written round it.  And a third showed the horn of an ox,\r\nwith an obscene inscription.\r\n\r\nOne of the most furious Jacobin women who marched with these wretches\r\nstopped to give vent to a thousand imprecations against the Queen.  Her\r\nMajesty asked whether she had ever seen her.  She replied that she had\r\nnot.  Whether she had done her any, personal wrong?  Her answer was the\r\nsame; but she added:\r\n\r\n“It is you who have caused the misery of the nation.”\r\n\r\n“You have been told so,” answered the Queen; “you are deceived.  As the\r\nwife of the King of France, and mother of the Dauphin, I am a\r\nFrench-woman; I shall never see my own country again, I can be happy or\r\nunhappy only in France; I was happy when you loved me.”\r\n\r\nThe fury began to weep, asked her pardon, and said, “It was because I did\r\nnot know you; I see that you are good.”\r\n\r\nSanterre, the monarch of the faubourgs, made his subjects file off as\r\nquickly as he could; and it was thought at the time that he was ignorant\r\nof the object of this insurrection, which was the murder of the royal\r\nfamily.  However, it was eight o’clock in the evening before the palace\r\nwas completely cleared.  Twelve deputies, impelled by attachment to the\r\nKing’s person, ranged themselves near him at the commencement of the\r\ninsurrection; but the deputation from the Assembly did not reach the\r\nTuileries until six in the evening; all the doors of the apartments were\r\nbroken.  The Queen pointed out to the deputies the state of the King’s\r\npalace, and the disgraceful manner in which his asylum had been violated\r\nunder the very eyes of the Assembly; she saw that Merlin de Thionville was\r\nso much affected as to shed tears while she spoke.\r\n\r\n“You weep, M. Merlin,” said she to him, “at seeing the King and his family\r\nso cruelly treated by a people whom he always wished to make happy.”\r\n\r\n“True, Madame,” replied Merlin; “I weep for the misfortunes of a beautiful\r\nand feeling woman, the mother of a family; but do not mistake, not one of\r\nmy tears falls for either King or Queen; I hate kings and queens,--it is\r\nmy religion.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen could not appreciate this madness, and saw all that was to be\r\napprehended by persons who evinced it.\r\n\r\nAll hope was gone, and nothing was thought of but succour from abroad. The\r\nQueen appealed to her family and the King’s brothers; her letters probably\r\nbecame more pressing, and expressed apprehensions upon the tardiness of\r\nrelief.  Her Majesty read me one to herself from the Archduchess\r\nChristina, Gouvernante of the Low Countries: she reproached the Queen for\r\nsome of her expressions, and told her that those out of France were at\r\nleast as much alarmed as herself at the King’s situation and her own; but\r\nthat the manner of attempting to assist her might either save her or\r\nendanger her safety; and that the members of the coalition were bound to\r\nact prudently, entrusted as they were with interests so dear to them.\r\n\r\nThe 14th of July, 1792, fixed by the constitution as the anniversary of\r\nthe independence of the nation drew near.  The King and Queen were\r\ncompelled to make their appearance on the occasion; aware that the plot of\r\nthe 20th of June had their assassination for its object, they had no doubt\r\nbut that their death was determined on for the day of this national\r\nfestival.  The Queen was recommended, in order to give the King’s friends\r\ntime to defend him if the attack should be made, to guard him against the\r\nfirst stroke of a dagger by making him wear a breastplate.  I was directed\r\nto get one made in my apartments: it was composed of fifteen folds of\r\nItalian taffety, and formed into an under-waistcoat and a wide belt.  This\r\nbreastplate was tried; it resisted all thrusts of the dagger, and several\r\nballs were turned aside by it.  When it was completed the difficulty was\r\nto let the King try it on without running the risk of being surprised.  I\r\nwore the immense heavy waistcoat as an under-petticoat for three days\r\nwithout being able to find a favourable moment. At length the King found\r\nan opportunity one morning to pull off his coat in the Queen’s chamber and\r\ntry on the breastplate.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was in bed; the King pulled me gently by the gown, and drew me\r\nas far as he could from the Queen’s bed, and said to me, in a very low\r\ntone of voice: “It is to satisfy her that I submit to this inconvenience:\r\nthey will not assassinate me; their scheme is changed; they will put me to\r\ndeath another way.”  The Queen heard the King whispering to me, and when\r\nhe was gone out she asked me what he had said.  I hesitated to answer; she\r\ninsisted that I should, saying that nothing must be concealed from her,\r\nand that she was resigned upon every point.\r\n\r\nWhen she was informed of the King’s remark she told me she had guessed it,\r\nthat he had long since observed to her that all which was going forward in\r\nFrance was an imitation of the revolution in England in the time of\r\nCharles I., and that he was incessantly reading the history of that\r\nunfortunate monarch in order that he might act better than Charles had\r\ndone at a similar crisis.  “I begin to be fearful of the King’s being\r\nbrought to trial,” continued the Queen; “as to me, I am a foreigner; they\r\nwill assassinate me.  What will become of my poor children?”\r\n\r\nThese sad ejaculations were followed by a torrent of tears.  I wished to\r\ngive her an antispasmodic; she refused it, saying that only happy women\r\ncould feel nervous; that the cruel situation to which she was reduced\r\nrendered these remedies useless.  In fact, the Queen, who during her\r\nhappier days was frequently attacked by hysterical disorders, enjoyed more\r\nuniform health when all the faculties of her soul were called forth to\r\nsupport her physical strength.\r\n\r\nI had prepared a corset for her, for the same purpose as the King’s\r\nunder-waistcoat, without her knowledge; but she would not make use of it;\r\nall my entreaties, all my tears, were in vain.  “If the factions\r\nassassinate me,” she replied, “it will be a fortunate event for me; they\r\nwill deliver me from a most painful existence.”  A few days after the King\r\nhad tried on his breastplate I met him on a back staircase.  I drew back\r\nto let him pass.  He stopped and took my hand; I wished to kiss his; he\r\nwould not suffer it, but drew me towards him by the hand, and kissed both\r\nmy cheeks without saying a single word.\r\n\r\nThe fear of another attack upon the Tuileries occasioned scrupulous search\r\namong the King’s papers.\r\n\r\nI burnt almost all those belonging to the Queen.  She put her family\r\nletters, a great deal of correspondence which she thought it necessary to\r\npreserve for the history of the era of the Revolution, and particularly\r\nBarnave’s letters and her answers, of which she had copies, into a\r\nportfolio, which she entrusted to M. de J----.  That gentleman was unable\r\nto save this deposit, and it was burnt.  The Queen left a few papers in\r\nher secretaire.  Among them were instructions to Madame de Tourzel,\r\nrespecting the dispositions of her children and the characters and\r\nabilities of the sub-governesses under that lady’s orders.  This paper,\r\nwhich the Queen drew up at the time of Madame de Tourzel’s appointment,\r\nwith several letters from Maria Theresa, filled with the best advice and\r\ninstructions, was printed after the 10th of August by order of the\r\nAssembly in the collection of papers found in the secretaires of the King\r\nand Queen.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty had still, without reckoning the income of the month, one\r\nhundred and forty thousand francs in gold.  She was desirous of depositing\r\nthe whole of it with me; but I advised her to retain fifteen hundred\r\nlouis, as a sum of rather considerable amount might be suddenly necessary\r\nfor her.  The King had an immense quantity of papers, and unfortunately\r\nconceived the idea of privately making, with the assistance of a locksmith\r\nwho had worked with him above ten years, a place of concealment in an\r\ninner corridor of his apartments.  The place of concealment, but for the\r\nman’s information, would have been long undiscovered?  The wall in which\r\nit was made was painted to imitate large stones, and the opening was\r\nentirely concealed among the brown grooves which formed the shaded part of\r\nthese painted stones.  But even before this locksmith had denounced what\r\nwas afterwards called the iron closet to the Assembly, the Queen was aware\r\nthat he had talked of it to some of his friends; and that this man, in\r\nwhom the King from long habit placed too much confidence, was a Jacobin.\r\nShe warned the King of it, and prevailed on him to fill a very large\r\nportfolio with all the papers he was most interested in preserving, and\r\nentrust it to me.  She entreated him in my presence to leave nothing in\r\nthis closet; and the King, in order to quiet her, told her that he had\r\nleft nothing there.  I would have taken the portfolio and carried it to my\r\napartment, but it was too heavy for me to lift.  The King said he would\r\ncarry it himself; I went before to open the doors for him.  When he placed\r\nthe portfolio in my inner closet he merely said, “The Queen will tell you\r\nwhat it contains.” Upon my return to the Queen I put the question to her,\r\ndeeming, from what the King had said, that it was necessary I should know.\r\n“They are,” the Queen answered me, “such documents as would be most\r\ndangerous to the King should they go so far as to proceed to a trial\r\nagainst him.  But what he wishes me to tell you is, that the portfolio\r\ncontains a ‘proces-verbal’ of a cabinet council, in which the King gave\r\nhis opinion against the war. He had it signed by all the ministers, and,\r\nin case of a trial, he trusts that this document will be very useful to\r\nhim.”  I asked the Queen to whom she thought I ought to commit the\r\nportfolio.  “To whom you please,” answered she; “you alone are answerable\r\nfor it.  Do not quit the palace even during your vacation months: there\r\nmay be circumstances under which it would be very desirable that we should\r\nbe able to have it instantly.”\r\n\r\nAt this period M. de La Fayette, who had probably given up the idea of\r\nestablishing a republic in France similar to that of the United States,\r\nand was desirous to support the first constitution which he had sworn to\r\ndefend, quitted his army and came to the Assembly for the purpose of\r\nsupporting by his presence and by an energetic speech a petition signed by\r\ntwenty thousand citizens against the late violation of the residence of\r\nthe King and his family.  The General found the constitutional party\r\npowerless, and saw that he himself had lost his popularity.  The Assembly\r\ndisapproved of the step he had taken; the King, for whom it, was taken,\r\nshowed no satisfaction at it, and he saw himself compelled to return to\r\nhis army as quickly as he could.  He thought he could rely on the National\r\nGuard; but on the day of his arrival those officers who were in the King’s\r\ninterest inquired of his Majesty whether they were to forward the views of\r\nGendral de La Fayette by joining him in such measures as he should pursue\r\nduring his stay at Paris.  The King enjoined them not to do so.  From this\r\nanswer M. de La Fayette perceived that he was abandoned by the remainder\r\nof his party in the Paris guard.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival a plan was presented to the Queen, in which it was proposed\r\nby a junction between La Fayette’s army and the King’s party to rescue the\r\nroyal family and convey them to Rouen.  I did not learn the particulars of\r\nthis plan; the Queen only said to me upon the subject that M. de La\r\nFayette was offered to them as a resource; but that it would be better for\r\nthem to perish than to owe their safety to the man who had done them the\r\nmost mischief, or to place themselves under the necessity of treating with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI passed the whole month of July without going to bed; I was fearful of\r\nsome attack by night.  There was one plot against the Queen’s life which\r\nhas never been made known.  I was alone by her bedside at one o’clock in\r\nthe morning; we heard somebody walking softly down the corridor, which\r\npasses along the whole line of her apartments, and which was then locked\r\nat each end.  I went out to fetch the valet de chambre; he entered the\r\ncorridor, and the Queen and myself soon heard the noise of two men\r\nfighting.  The unfortunate Princess held me locked in her arms, and said\r\nto me, “What a situation! insults by day and assassins by night!” The\r\nvalet de chambre cried out to her from the corridor, “Madame, it is a\r\nwretch that I know; I have him!”--“Let him go,” said the Queen; “open the\r\ndoor to him; he came to murder me; the Jacobins would carry him about in\r\ntriumph to-morrow.”  The man was a servant of the King’s toilet, who had\r\ntaken the key of the corridor out of his Majesty’s pocket after he was in\r\nbed, no doubt with the intention of committing the crime suspected.  The\r\nvalet de chambre, who was a very strong man, held him by the wrists, and\r\nthrust him out at the door.  The wretch did not speak a word.  The valet\r\nde chambre said, in answer to the Queen, who spoke to him gratefully of\r\nthe danger to which he had exposed himself, that he feared nothing, and\r\nthat he had always a pair of excellent pistols about him for no other\r\npurpose than to defend her Majesty.  The next day M. de Septeuil had all\r\nthe locks of the King’s inner apartments changed.  I did the same by those\r\nof the Queen.\r\n\r\nWe were every moment told that the Faubourg St. Antoine was preparing to\r\nmarch against the palace.  At four o’clock one morning towards the latter\r\nend of July a person came to give me information to that effect.  I\r\ninstantly sent off two men, on whom I could rely, with orders to proceed\r\nto the usual places for assembling, and to come back speedily and give me\r\nan account of the state of the city.  We knew that at least an hour must\r\nelapse before the populace or the faubourgs assembled on the site of the\r\nBastille could reach the Tuileries.  It seemed to me sufficient for the\r\nQueen’s safety that all about her should be awakened. I went softly into\r\nher room; she was asleep; I did not awaken her.  I found General de\r\nW----in the great closet; he told me the meeting was, for this once,\r\ndispersing.  The General had endeavoured to please the populace by the\r\nsame means as M. de La Fayette had employed.  He saluted the lowest\r\npoissarde, and lowered his hat down to his very stirrup. But the populace,\r\nwho had been flattered for three years, required far different homage to\r\nits power, and the poor man was unnoticed.  The King had been awakened,\r\nand so had Madame Elisabeth, who had gone to him.  The Queen, yielding to\r\nthe weight of her griefs, slept till nine o’clock on that day, which was\r\nvery unusual with her.  The King had already been to know whether she was\r\nawake; I told him what I had done, and the care I had taken not to disturb\r\nher.  He thanked me, and said, “I was awake, and so was the whole palace;\r\nshe ran no risk.  I am very glad to see her take a little rest.  Alas! her\r\ngriefs double mine!” What was my chagrin when, upon awaking and learning\r\nwhat had passed, the Queen burst into tears from regret at not having been\r\ncalled, and began to upbraid me, on whose friendship she ought to have\r\nbeen able to rely, for having served her so ill under such circumstances!\r\nIn vain did I reiterate that it had been only a false alarm, and that she\r\nrequired to have her strength recruited. “It is not diminished,” said she;\r\n“misfortune gives us additional strength.  Elisabeth was with the King,\r\nand I was asleep,--I who am determined to perish by his side!  I am his\r\nwife; I will not suffer him to incur the smallest risk without my sharing\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring July the correspondence of M. Bertrand de Molleville with the King\r\nand Queen was most active.  M. de Marsilly, formerly a lieutenant of the\r\nCent-Suisses of the Guard, was the bearer of the letters.\r\n\r\n[I received by night only the King’s answer, written with his own hand, in\r\nthe margin of my letter.  I always sent him back with the day’s letter\r\nthat to which he had replied the day before, so that my letters and his\r\nanswers, of which I contented myself with taking notes only, never\r\nremained with me twenty-four hours.  I proposed this arrangement to his\r\nMajesty to remove all uneasiness from his mind; my letters were generally\r\ndelivered to the King or the Queen by M. de Marsilly, captain of the\r\nKing’s Guard, whose attachment and fidelity were known to their Majesties.\r\nI also sometimes employed M. Bernard de Marigny, who had left Brest for\r\nthe purpose of sharing with his Majesty’s faithful servants the dangers\r\nwhich threatened the King.--“Memoirs of Bertrand de Molleville,” vol.\r\nii., p.  12.]\r\n\r\nHe came to me the first time with a note from the Queen directed to M.\r\nBertrand himself.  In this note the Queen said: “Address yourself with\r\nfull confidence to Madame Campan; the conduct of her brother in Russia has\r\nnot at all influenced her sentiments; she is wholly devoted to us; and if,\r\nhereafter, you should have anything to say to us verbally, you may rely\r\nentirely upon her devotion and discretion.”\r\n\r\nThe mobs which gathered almost nightly in the faubourgs alarmed the\r\nQueen’s friends; they entreated her not to sleep in her room on the ground\r\nfloor of the Tuileries.  She removed to the first floor, to a room which\r\nwas between the King’s apartments and those of the Dauphin.  Being awake\r\nalways from daybreak, she ordered that neither the shutters nor the\r\nwindow-blinds should be closed, that her long sleepless nights might be\r\nthe less weary.  About the middle of one of these nights, when the moon\r\nwas shining into her bedchamber, she gazed at it, and told me that in a\r\nmonth she should not see that moon unless freed from her chains, and\r\nbeholding the King at liberty.  She then imparted to me all that was\r\nconcurring to deliver them; but said that the opinions of their intimate\r\nadvisers were alarmingly at variance; that some vouched for complete\r\nsuccess, while others pointed out insurmountable dangers.  She added that\r\nshe possessed the itinerary of the march of the Princes and the King of\r\nPrussia: that on such a day they would be at Verdun, on another day at\r\nsuch a place, that Lille was about to be besieged, but that M. de J-----,\r\nwhose prudence and intelligence the King, as well as herself, highly\r\nvalued, alarmed them much respecting the success of that siege, and made\r\nthem apprehensive that, even were the commandant devoted to them, the\r\ncivil authority, which by the constitution gave great power to the mayors\r\nof towns, would overrule the military commandant.  She was also very\r\nuneasy as to what would take place at Paris during the interval, and spoke\r\nto me of the King’s want of energy, but always in terms expressive of her\r\nveneration for his virtues and her attachment to himself.--“The King,”\r\n said she, “is not a coward; he possesses abundance of passive courage, but\r\nhe is overwhelmed by an awkward shyness, a mistrust of himself, which\r\nproceeds from his education as much as from his disposition.  He is afraid\r\nto command, and, above all things, dreads speaking to assembled numbers.\r\nHe lived like a child, and always ill at ease under the eyes of Louis XV.,\r\nuntil the age of twenty-one.  This constraint confirmed his timidity.\r\n\r\n“Circumstanced as we are, a few well-delivered words addressed to the\r\nParisians, who are devoted to him, would multiply the strength of our\r\nparty a hundredfold: he will not utter them.  What can we expect from\r\nthose addresses to the people which he has been advised to post up?\r\nNothing but fresh outrages.  As for myself, I could do anything, and would\r\nappear on horseback if necessary.  But if I were really to begin to act,\r\nthat would be furnishing arms to the King’s enemies; the cry against the\r\nAustrian, and against the sway of a woman, would become general in France;\r\nand, moreover, by showing myself, I should render the King a mere nothing.\r\nA queen who is not regent ought, under these circumstances, to remain\r\npassive and prepare to die.”\r\n\r\nThe garden of the Tuileries was full of maddened men, who insulted all who\r\nseemed to side with the Court.  “The Life of Marie Antoinette” was cried\r\nunder the Queen’s windows, infamous plates were annexed to the book, the\r\nhawkers showed them to the passersby.  On all sides were heard the\r\njubilant outcries of a people in a state of delirium almost as frightful\r\nas the explosion of their rage.  The Queen and her children were unable to\r\nbreathe the open air any longer.  It was determined that the garden of the\r\nTuileries should be closed: as soon as this step was taken the Assembly\r\ndecreed that the whole length of the Terrace des Feuillans belonged to it,\r\nand fixed the boundary between what was called the national ground and the\r\nCoblentz ground by a tricoloured ribbon stretched from one end of the\r\nterrace to the other.  All good citizens were ordered, by notices affixed\r\nto it, not to go down into the garden, under pain of being treated in the\r\nsame manner as Foulon and Berthier. A young man who did not observe this\r\nwritten order went down into the garden; furious outcries, threats of la\r\nlanterne, and the crowd of people which collected upon the terrace warned\r\nhim of his imprudence, and the danger which he ran.  He immediately pulled\r\noff his shoes, took out his handkerchief, and wiped the dust from their\r\nsoles.  The people cried out, “Bravo!  the good citizen for ever!”  He was\r\ncarried off in triumph.  The shutting up of the Tuileries did not enable\r\nthe Queen and her children to walk in the garden.  The people on the\r\nterrace sent forth dreadful shouts, and she was twice compelled to return\r\nto her apartments.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of August many zealous persons offered the King money;\r\nhe refused considerable sums, being unwilling to injure the fortunes of\r\nindividuals.  M. de la Ferte, intendant of the ‘menus plaisirs’, brought\r\nme a thousand louis, requesting me to lay them at the feet of the Queen.\r\nHe thought she could not have too much money at so perilous a time, and\r\nthat every good Frenchman should hasten to place all his ready money in\r\nher hands.  She refused this sum, and others of much greater amount which\r\nwere offered to her.\r\n\r\n[M. Auguie, my brother-in-law, receiver-general of the finances, offered\r\nher, through his wife, a portfolio containing one hundred thousand crowns\r\nin paper money.  On this occasion the Queen said the most affecting things\r\nto my sister, expressive of her happiness at having contributed to the\r\nfortunes of such faithful subjects as herself and her husband, but\r\ndeclined her offer.--MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nHowever, a few days afterwards, she told me she would accept M. de la\r\nFerte’s twenty-four thousand francs, because they would make up a sum\r\nwhich the King had to expend.  She therefore directed, me to go and\r\nreceive those twenty-four thousand francs, to add them to the one hundred\r\nthousand francs she had placed in my hands, and to change the whole into\r\nassignats to increase their amount.  Her orders were executed, and the\r\nassignats were delivered to the King.  The Queen informed me that Madame\r\nElisabeth had found a well-meaning man who had engaged to gain over Petion\r\nby the bribe of a large sum of money, and that deputy would, by a\r\npreconcerted signal, inform the King of the success of the project.  His\r\nMajesty soon had an opportunity of seeing Petion, and on the Queen asking\r\nhim before me if he was satisfied with him, the King replied, “Neither\r\nmore nor less satisfied than usual; he did not make the concerted signal,\r\nand I believe I have been cheated.”  The Queen then condescended to\r\nexplain the whole of the enigma to me.  “Petion,” said she, “was, while\r\ntalking to the King, to have kept his finger fixed upon his right eye for\r\nat least two seconds.”--“He did not even put his hand up to his chin,”\r\n said the King; “after all, it is but so much money stolen: the thief will\r\nnot boast of it, and the affair will remain a secret.  Let us talk of\r\nsomething else.”  He turned to me and said, “Your father was an intimate\r\nfriend of Mandat, who now commands the National Guard; describe him to me;\r\nwhat ought I to expect from him?”  I answered that he was one of his\r\nMajesty’s most faithful subjects, but that with a great deal of loyalty he\r\npossessed very little sense, and that he was involved in the\r\nconstitutional vortex.  “I understand,” said the King; “he is a man who\r\nwould defend my palace and my person, because that is enjoined by the\r\nconstitution which he has sworn to support, but who would fight against\r\nthe party in favour of sovereign authority; it is well to know this with\r\ncertainty.”\r\n\r\nOn the next day the Princesse de Lamballe sent for me very early in the\r\nmorning.  I found her on a sofa facing a window that looked upon the Pont\r\nRoyal.  She then occupied that apartment of the Pavilion of Flora which\r\nwas on a level with that of the Queen.  She desired me to sit down by her.\r\nHer Highness had a writing-desk upon her knees.  “You have had many\r\nenemies,” said she; “attempts have been made to deprive you of the Queen’s\r\nfavour; they have been far from successful.  Do you know that even I\r\nmyself, not being so well acquainted with you as the Queen, was rendered\r\nsuspicious of you; and that upon the arrival of the Court at the Tuileries\r\nI gave you a companion to be a spy upon you; and that I had another\r\nbelonging to the police placed at your door!  I was assured that you\r\nreceived five or six of the most virulent deputies of the Tiers Etat; but\r\nit was that wardrobe woman whose rooms were above you.\r\n\r\n“In short,” said the Princess, “persons of integrity have nothing to fear\r\nfrom the evil-disposed when they belong to so upright a prince as the\r\nKing.  As to the Queen, she knows you, and has loved you ever since she\r\ncame into France.  You shall judge of the King’s opinion of you: it was\r\nyesterday evening decided in the family circle that, at a time when the\r\nTuileries is likely to be attacked, it was necessary to have the most\r\nfaithful account of the opinions and conduct of all the individuals\r\ncomposing the Queen’s service.  The King takes the same precaution on his\r\npart respecting all who are about him.  He said there was with him a\r\nperson of great integrity, to whom he would commit this inquiry; and that,\r\nwith regard to the Queen’s household, you must be spoken to, that he had\r\nlong studied your character, and that he esteemed your veracity.”\r\n\r\nThe Princess had a list of the names of all who belonged to the Queen’s\r\nchamber on her desk.  She asked me for information respecting each\r\nindividual.  I was fortunate in having none but the most favourable\r\ninformation to give.  I had to speak of my avowed enemy in the Queen’s\r\nchamber; of her who most wished that I should be responsible for my\r\nbrother’s political opinions.  The Princess, as the head of the chamber,\r\ncould not be ignorant of this circumstance; but as the person in question,\r\nwho idolised the King and Queen, would not have hesitated to sacrifice her\r\nlife in order to save theirs, and as possibly her attachment to them,\r\nunited to considerable narrowness of intellect and a limited education,\r\ncontributed to her jealousy of me, I spoke of her in the highest terms.\r\n\r\nThe Princess wrote as I dictated, and occasionally looked at me with\r\nastonishment.  When I had done I entreated her to write in the margin that\r\nthe lady alluded to was my declared enemy.  She embraced me, saying, “Ah!\r\ndo not write it!  we should not record an unhappy circumstance which ought\r\nto be forgotten.”  We came to a man of genius who was much attached to the\r\nQueen, and I described him as a man born solely to contradict, showing\r\nhimself an aristocrat with democrats, and a democrat among aristocrats;\r\nbut still a man of probity, and well disposed to his sovereign.  The\r\nPrincess said she knew many persons of that disposition, and that she was\r\ndelighted I had nothing to say against this man, because she herself had\r\nplaced him about the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe whole of her Majesty’s chamber, which consisted entirely of persons of\r\nfidelity, gave throughout all the dreadful convulsions of the Revolution\r\nproofs of the greatest prudence and self-devotion.  The same cannot be\r\nsaid of the antechambers.  With the exception of three or four, all the\r\nservants of that class were outrageous Jacobins; and I saw on those\r\noccasions the necessity of composing the private household of princes of\r\npersons completely separated from the class of the people.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the royal family was so unbearable during the months\r\nwhich immediately preceded the 10th of August that the Queen longed for\r\nthe crisis, whatever might be its issue.  She frequently said that a long\r\nconfinement in a tower by the seaside would seem to her less intolerable\r\nthan those feuds in which the weakness of her party daily threatened an\r\ninevitable catastrophe.\r\n\r\n[A few days before the 10th of August the squabbles between the royalists\r\nand the Jacobins, and between the Jacobins and the constitutionalists,\r\nincreased in warmth; among the latter those men who defended the\r\nprinciples they professed with the greatest talent, courage, and constancy\r\nwere at the same time the most exposed to danger.  Montjoie says: “The\r\nquestion of dethronement was discussed with a degree of frenzy in the\r\nAssembly.  Such of the deputies as voted against it were abused, ill\r\ntreated, and surrounded by assassins.  They had a battle to fight at every\r\nstep they took; and at length they did not dare to sleep in their own\r\nhouses.  Of this number were Regnault de Beaucaron, Froudiere, Girardin,\r\nand Vaublanc.  Girardin complained of having been struck in one of the\r\nlobbies of the Assembly.  A voice cried out to him, ‘Say where were you\r\nstruck.’  ‘Where?’ replied Girardin, ‘what a question!  Behind. Do\r\nassassins ever strike otherwise?”]\r\n\r\nNot only were their Majesties prevented from breathing the open air, but\r\nthey were also insulted at the very foot of the altar.  The Sunday before\r\nthe last day of the monarchy, while the royal family went through the\r\ngallery to the chapel, half the soldiers of the National Guard exclaimed,\r\n“Long live the King!” and the other half, “No; no King!  Down with the\r\nveto!” and on that day at vespers the choristers preconcerted to use loud\r\nand threatening emphasis when chanting the words, “Deposuit potentes de\r\nsede,” in the “Magnificat.”  Incensed at such an irreverent proceeding,\r\nthe royalists in their turn thrice exclaimed, “Et reginam,” after the\r\n“Domine salvum fac regem.”  The tumult during the whole time of divine\r\nservice was excessive.\r\n\r\nAt length the terrible night of the 10th of August, 1792, arrived.  On the\r\npreceding evening Potion went to the Assembly and informed it that\r\npreparations were making for an insurrection on the following day; that\r\nthe tocsin would sound at midnight; and that he feared he had not\r\nsufficient means for resisting the attack which was about to take place.\r\nUpon this information the Assembly passed to the order of the day. Petion,\r\nhowever, gave an order for repelling force by force.\r\n\r\n[Petion was the Mayor of Paris, and Mandat on this day was commandant of\r\nthe National Guard.  Mandat was assassinated that night.--“Thiers,” vol.\r\ni., p. 260.]\r\n\r\nM. Mandat was armed with this order; and, finding his fidelity to the\r\nKing’s person supported by what he considered the law of the State, he\r\nconducted himself in all his operations with the greatest energy.  On the\r\nevening of the 9th I was present at the King’s supper.  While his Majesty\r\nwas giving me various orders we heard a great noise at the door of the\r\napartment.  I went to see what was the cause of it, and found the two\r\nsentinels fighting.  One said, speaking of the King, that he was hearty in\r\nthe cause of the constitution, and would defend it at the peril of his\r\nlife; the other maintained that he was an encumbrance to the only\r\nconstitution suitable to a free people.  They were almost ready to cut one\r\nanother’s throats.  I returned with a countenance which betrayed my\r\nemotion.  The King desired to know what was going forward at his door; I\r\ncould not conceal it from him.  The Queen said she was not at all\r\nsurprised at it, and that more than half the guard belonged to the Jacobin\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nThe tocsin sounded at midnight.  The Swiss were drawn up like walls; and\r\nin the midst of their soldierlike silence, which formed a striking\r\ncontrast with the perpetual din of the town guard, the King informed M. de\r\nJ-----, an officer of the staff, of the plan of defence laid down by\r\nGeneral Viomenil.  M. de J----- said to me, after this private conference,\r\n“Put your jewels and money into your pockets; our dangers are unavoidable;\r\nthe means of defence are nil; safety might be obtained by some degree of\r\nenergy in the King, but that is the only virtue in which he is deficient.”\r\n\r\nAn hour after midnight the Queen and Madame Elisabeth said they would lie\r\ndown on a sofa in a room in the entresols, the windows of which commanded\r\nthe courtyard of the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nThe Queen told me the King had just refused to put on his quilted\r\nunder-waistcoat; that he had consented to wear it on the 14th of July\r\nbecause he was merely going to a ceremony where the blade of an assassin\r\nwas to be apprehended, but that on a day on which his party might fight\r\nagainst the revolutionists he thought there was something cowardly in\r\npreserving his life by such means.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Madame Elisabeth disengaged herself from some of her\r\nclothing which encumbered her in order to lie down on the sofa: she took a\r\ncornelian pin out of her cape, and before she laid it down on the table\r\nshe showed it to me, and desired me to read a motto engraved upon it round\r\na stalk of lilies.  The words were, “Oblivion of injuries; pardon for\r\noffences.”--“I much fear,” added that virtuous Princess, “this maxim has\r\nbut little influence among our enemies; but it ought not to be less dear\r\nto us on that account.”\r\n\r\n[The exalted piety of Madame Elisabeth gave to all she said and did a\r\nnoble character, descriptive of that of her soul.  On the day on which\r\nthis worthy descendant of Saint Louis was sacrificed, the executioner, in\r\ntying her hands behind her, raised up one of the ends of her handkerchief.\r\nMadame Elisabeth, with calmness, and in a voice which seemed not to belong\r\nto earth, said to him, “In the name of modesty, cover my bosom.”  I\r\nlearned this from Madame de Serilly, who was condemned the same day as the\r\nPrincess, but who obtained a respite at the moment of the execution,\r\nMadame de Montmorin, her relation, declaring that her cousin was\r\nenceinte.-MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nThe Queen desired me to sit down by her; the two Princesses could not\r\nsleep; they were conversing mournfully upon their situation when a musket\r\nwas discharged in the courtyard.  They both quitted the sofa, saying,\r\n“There is the first shot, unfortunately it will not be the last; let us go\r\nup to the King.”  The Queen desired me to follow her; several of her women\r\nwent with me.\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock the Queen came out of the King’s chamber and told us she\r\nhad no longer any hope; that M. Mandat, who had gone to the Hotel de Ville\r\nto receive further orders, had just been assassinated, and that the people\r\nwere at that time carrying his head about the streets.  Day came. The\r\nKing, the Queen, Madame Elisabeth, Madame, and the Dauphin went down to\r\npass through the ranks of the sections of the National Guard; the cry of\r\n“Vive le Roi!” was heard from a few places.  I was at a window on the\r\ngarden side; I saw some of the gunners quit their posts, go up to the\r\nKing, and thrust their fists in his face, insulting him by the most brutal\r\nlanguage.  Messieurs de Salvert and de Bridges drove them off in a\r\nspirited manner.  The King was as pale as a corpse.  The royal family came\r\nin again.  The Queen told me that all was lost; that the King had shown no\r\nenergy; and that this sort of review had done more harm than good.\r\n\r\nI was in the billiard-room with my companions; we placed ourselves upon\r\nsome high benches.  I then saw M. d’Hervilly with a drawn sword in his\r\nhand, ordering the usher to open the door to the French noblesse.  Two\r\nhundred persons entered the room nearest to that in which the family were;\r\nothers drew up in two lines in the preceding rooms.  I saw a few people\r\nbelonging to the Court, many others whose features were unknown to me, and\r\na few who figured technically without right among what was called the\r\nnoblesse, but whose self-devotion ennobled them at once.  They were all so\r\nbadly armed that even in that situation the indomitable French liveliness\r\nindulged in jests.  M. de Saint-Souplet, one of the King’s equerries, and\r\na page, carried on their shoulders instead of muskets the tongs belonging\r\nto the King’s antechamber, which they had broken and divided between them.\r\nAnother page, who had a pocket-pistol in his hand, stuck the end of it\r\nagainst the back of the person who stood before him, and who begged he\r\nwould be good enough to rest it elsewhere.  A sword and a pair of pistols\r\nwere the only arms of those who had had the precaution to provide\r\nthemselves with arms at all.  Meanwhile, the numerous bands from the\r\nfaubourgs, armed with pikes and cutlasses, filled the Carrousel and the\r\nstreets adjacent to the Tuileries.  The sanguinary Marseillais were at\r\ntheir head, with cannon pointed against the Chateau.  In this emergency\r\nthe King’s Council sent M. Dejoly, the Minister of Justice, to the\r\nAssembly to request they would send the King a deputation which might\r\nserve as a safeguard to the executive power.  His ruin was resolved on;\r\nthey passed to the order of the day.  At eight o’clock the department\r\nrepaired to the Chateau.  The procureur-syndic, seeing that the guard\r\nwithin was ready to join the assailants, went into the King’s closet and\r\nrequested to speak to him in private.  The King received him in his\r\nchamber; the Queen was with him.  There M. Roederer told him that the\r\nKing, all his family, and the people about them would inevitably perish\r\nunless his Majesty immediately determined to go to the National Assembly.\r\nThe Queen at first opposed this advice, but the procureur-syndic told her\r\nthat she rendered herself responsible for the deaths of the King, her\r\nchildren, and all who were in the palace.  She no longer objected.  The\r\nKing then consented to go to the Assembly.  As he set out, he said to the\r\nminister and persons who surrounded him, “Come, gentlemen, there is\r\nnothing more to be done here.”\r\n\r\n[“The King hesitated, the Queen manifested the highest dissatisfaction.\r\n‘What!’ said she,’ are we alone; is there nobody who can act?’--‘Yes,\r\nMadame, alone; action is useless--resistance is impossible.’ One of the\r\nmembers of the department, M. Gerdrot, insisted on the prompt execution of\r\nthe proposed measure.  ‘Silence, monsieur,’ said the Queen to him;\r\n‘silence; you are the only person who ought to be silent here; when the\r\nmischief is done, those who did it should not pretend to wish to remedy\r\nit.’ .  .  .\r\n\r\n“The King remained mute; nobody spoke.  It was reserved for me to give the\r\nlast piece of advice.  I had the firmness to say, ‘Let us go, and not\r\ndeliberate; honour commands it, the good of the State requires it.  Let us\r\ngo to the National Assembly; this step ought to have been taken long ago:\r\n‘Let us go,’ said the King, raising his right hand; ‘let us start; let us\r\ngive this last mark of self-devotion, since it is necessary.’  The Queen\r\nwas persuaded.  Her first anxiety was for the King, the second for her\r\nson; the King had none.  ‘M. Roederer--gentlemen,’ said the Queen, ‘you\r\nanswer for the person of the King; you answer for that of my\r\nson.’--‘Madame,’ replied M. Roederer, ‘we pledge ourselves to die at your\r\nside; that is all we can engage for.’”--MONTJOIE, “History of Marie\r\nAntoinette.”]\r\n\r\nThe Queen said to me as she left the King’s chamber, “Wait in my\r\napartments; I will come to you, or I will send for you to go I know not\r\nwhither.”  She took with her only the Princesse de Lamballe and Madame de\r\nTourzel.  The Princesse de Tarente and Madame de la Roche-Aymon were\r\ninconsolable at being left at the Tuileries; they, and all who belonged to\r\nthe chamber, went down into the Queen’s apartments.\r\n\r\nWe saw the royal family pass between two lines formed by the Swiss\r\ngrenadiers and those of the battalions of the Petits-Peres and the Filles\r\nSaint Thomas.  They were so pressed upon by the crowd that during that\r\nshort passage the Queen was robbed of her watch and purse.  A man of great\r\nheight and horrible appearance, one of such as were to be seen at the head\r\nof all the insurrections, drew near the Dauphin, whom the Queen was\r\nleading by the hand, and took him up in his arms.  The Queen uttered a\r\nscream of terror, and was ready to faint.  The man said to her, “Don’t be\r\nfrightened, I will do him no harm;” and he gave him back to her at the\r\nentrance of the chamber.\r\n\r\nI leave to history all the details of that too memorable day, confining\r\nmyself to recalling a few of the frightful scenes acted in the interior of\r\nthe Tuileries after the King had quitted the palace.\r\n\r\nThe assailants did not know that the King and his family had betaken\r\nthemselves to the Assembly; and those who defended the palace from the\r\naide of the courts were equally ignorant of it.  It is supposed that if\r\nthey had been aware of the fact the siege would never have taken place.\r\n\r\n[In reading of the events of the 10th of August, 1792, the reader must\r\nremember that there was hardly any armed force to resist the mob.  The\r\nregiments that had shown signs of being loyal to the King had been removed\r\nfrom Paris by the Assembly.  The Swiss had been deprived of their own\r\nartillery, and the Court had sent one of their battalions into Normandy at\r\na time when there was an idea of taking refuge there.  The National Guard\r\nwere either disloyal or disheartened, and the gunners, especially of that\r\nforce at the Tuileries, sympathised with the mob.  Thus the King had about\r\n800 or 900 Swiss and little more than one battalion of the National Guard.\r\nMandat, one of the six heads of the legions of the National Guard, to\r\nwhose turn the command fell on that day, was true to his duty, but was\r\nsent for to the Hotel de Ville and assassinated.  Still the small force,\r\neven after the departure of the King, would have probably beaten off the\r\nmob had not the King given the fatal order to the Swiss to cease firing.\r\n(See Thiers’s “Revolution Francaise,” vol.  i., chap.  xi.) Bonaparte’s\r\nopinion of the mob may be judged by his remarks on the 20th June, 1792,\r\nwhen, disgusted at seeing the King appear with the red cap on his head, he\r\nexclaimed, “Che coglione!  Why have they let in all that rabble?  Why\r\ndon’t they sweep off 400 or 500 of them with the cannon?  The rest would\r\nthen set off.”  (“Bourrienne,” vol. i., p.13, Bentley, London, 1836.)\r\nBonaparte carried out his own plan against a far stronger force of\r\nassailants on the Jour des Sections, 4th October, 1795.]\r\n\r\nThe Marseillais began by driving from their posts several Swiss, who\r\nyielded without resistance; a few of the assailants fired upon them; some\r\nof the Swiss officers, seeing their men fall, and perhaps thinking the\r\nKing was still at the Tuileries, gave the word to a whole battalion to\r\nfire.  The aggressors were thrown into disorder, and the Carrousel was\r\ncleared in a moment; but they soon returned, spurred on by rage and\r\nrevenge.  The Swiss were but eight hundred strong; they fell back into the\r\ninterior of the Chateau; some of the doors were battered in by the guns,\r\nothers broken through with hatchets; the populace rushed from all quarters\r\ninto the interior of the palace; almost all the Swiss were massacred; the\r\nnobles, flying through the gallery which leads to the Louvre, were either\r\nstabbed or shot, and the bodies thrown out of the windows.\r\n\r\nM. Pallas and M. de Marchais, ushers of the King’s chamber, were killed in\r\ndefending the door of the council chamber; many others of the King’s\r\nservants fell victims to their fidelity.  I mention these two persons in\r\nparticular because, with their hats pulled over their brows and their\r\nswords in their hands, they exclaimed, as they defended themselves with\r\nunavailing courage, “We will not survive!--this is our post; our duty is\r\nto die at it.”  M. Diet behaved in the same manner at the door of the\r\nQueen’s bedchamber; he experienced the same fate.  The Princesse de\r\nTarente had fortunately opened the door of the apartments; otherwise, the\r\ndreadful band seeing several women collected in the Queen’s salon would\r\nhave fancied she was among us, and would have immediately massacred us had\r\nwe resisted them.  We were, indeed, all about to perish, when a man with a\r\nlong beard came up, exclaiming, in the name of Potion, “Spare the women;\r\ndon’t dishonour the nation!”  A particular circumstance placed me in\r\ngreater danger than the others.  In my confusion I imagined, a moment\r\nbefore the assailants entered the Queen’s apartments, that my sister was\r\nnot among the group of women collected there; and I went up into an\r\n‘entresol’, where I supposed she had taken refuge, to induce her to come\r\ndown, fancying it safer that we should not be separated.  I did not find\r\nher in the room in question; I saw there only our two femmes de chambre\r\nand one of the Queen’s two heyducs, a man of great height and military\r\naspect.  I saw that he was pale, and sitting on a bed.  I cried out to\r\nhim, “Fly! the footmen and our people are already safe.”--“I cannot,” said\r\nthe man to me; “I am dying of fear.”  As he spoke I heard a number of men\r\nrushing hastily up the staircase; they threw themselves upon him, and I\r\nsaw him assassinated.\r\n\r\nI ran towards the staircase, followed by our women.  The murderers left\r\nthe heyduc to come to me.  The women threw themselves at their feet, and\r\nheld their sabres.  The narrowness of the staircase impeded the assassins;\r\nbut I had already felt a horrid hand thrust into my back to seize me by my\r\nclothes, when some one called out from the bottom of the staircase, “What\r\nare you doing above there?  We don’t kill women.”  I was on my knees; my\r\nexecutioner quitted his hold of me, and said, “Get up, you jade; the\r\nnation pardons you.”\r\n\r\nThe brutality of these words did not prevent my suddenly experiencing an\r\nindescribable feeling which partook almost equally of the love of life and\r\nthe idea that I was going to see my son, and all that was dear to me,\r\nagain.  A moment before I had thought less of death than of the pain which\r\nthe steel, suspended over my head, would occasion me.  Death is seldom\r\nseen so close without striking his blow.  I heard every syllable uttered\r\nby the assassins, just as if I had been calm.\r\n\r\nFive or six men seized me and my companions, and, having made us get up on\r\nbenches placed before the windows, ordered us to call out, “The nation for\r\never!”\r\n\r\nI passed over several corpses; I recognised that of the old Vicomte de\r\nBroves, to whom the Queen had sent me at the beginning of the night to\r\ndesire him and another old man in her name to go home.  These brave men\r\ndesired I would tell her Majesty that they had but too strictly obeyed the\r\nKing’s orders in all circumstances under which they ought to have exposed\r\ntheir own lives in order to preserve his; and that for this once they\r\nwould not obey, though they would cherish the recollection of the Queen’s\r\ngoodness.\r\n\r\nNear the grille, on the side next the bridge, the men who conducted me\r\nasked whither I wished to go.  Upon my inquiring, in my turn, whether they\r\nwere at liberty to take me wherever I might wish to go, one of them, a\r\nMarseillais, asked me, giving me at the same time a push with the butt end\r\nof his musket, whether I still doubted the power of the people?  I\r\nanswered “No,” and I mentioned the number of my brother-in-law’s house. I\r\nsaw my sister ascending the steps of the parapet of the bridge, surrounded\r\nby members of the National Guard.  I called to her, and she turned round.\r\n“Would you have her go with you?” said my guardian to me. I told him I did\r\nwish it.  They called the people who were leading my sister to prison; she\r\njoined me.\r\n\r\nMadame de la Roche-Aymon and her daughter, Mademoiselle Pauline de\r\nTourzel, Madame de Ginestoux, lady to the Princesse de Lamballe, the other\r\nwomen of the Queen, and the old Comte d’Affry, were led off together to\r\nthe Abbaye.\r\n\r\nOur progress from the Tuileries to my sister’s house was most distressing.\r\nWe saw several Swiss pursued and killed, and musket-shots were crossing\r\neach other in all directions.  We passed under the walls of the Louvre;\r\nthey were firing from the parapet into the windows of the gallery, to hit\r\nthe knights of the dagger; for thus did the populace designate those\r\nfaithful subjects who had assembled at the Tuileries to defend the King.\r\n\r\nThe brigands broke some vessels of water in the Queen’s first antechamber;\r\nthe mixture of blood and water stained the skirts of our white gowns.  The\r\npoissardes screamed after us in the streets that we were attached to the\r\nAustrian.  Our protectors then showed some consideration for us, and made\r\nus go up a gateway to pull off our gowns; but our petticoats being too\r\nshort, and making us look like persons in disguise, other poissardes began\r\nto bawl out that we were young Swiss dressed up like women.  We then saw a\r\ntribe of female cannibals enter the street, carrying the head of poor\r\nMandat.  Our guards made us hastily enter a little public-house, called\r\nfor wine, and desired us to drink with them.  They assured the landlady\r\nthat we were their sisters, and good patriots.  Happily the Marseillais\r\nhad quitted us to return to the Tuileries.  One of the men who remained\r\nwith us said to me in a low voice: “I am a gauze-worker in the faubourg.\r\nI was forced to march; I am not for all this; I have not killed anybody,\r\nand have rescued you.  You ran a great risk when we met the mad women who\r\nare carrying Mandat’s head.  These horrible women said yesterday at\r\nmidnight, upon the site of the Bastille, that they must have their revenge\r\nfor the 6th of October, at Versailles, and that they had sworn to kill the\r\nQueen and all the women attached to her; the danger of the action saved\r\nyou all.”\r\n\r\nAs I crossed the Carrousel, I saw my house in flames; but as soon as the\r\nfirst moment of affright was over, I thought no more of my personal\r\nmisfortunes.  My ideas turned solely upon the dreadful situation of the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nOn reaching my sister’s we found all our family in despair, believing they\r\nshould never see us again.  I could not remain in her house; some of the\r\nmob, collected round the door, exclaimed that Marie Antoinette’s\r\nconfidante was in the house, and that they must have her head.  I\r\ndisguised myself, and was concealed in the house of M. Morel, secretary\r\nfor the lotteries.  On the morrow I was inquired for there, in the name of\r\nthe Queen.  A deputy, whose sentiments were known to her, took upon\r\nhimself to find me out.\r\n\r\nI borrowed clothes, and went with my sister to the Feuillans--[A former\r\nmonastery near the Tuileries, so called from the Bernardines, one of the\r\nCistercian orders; later a revolutionary club.]--We got there at the same\r\ntime with M. Thierry de Ville d’Avray, the King’s first valet de chambre.\r\nWe were taken into an office, where we wrote down our names and places of\r\nabode, and we received tickets for admission into the rooms belonging to\r\nCamus, the keeper of the Archives, where the King was with his family.\r\n\r\nAs we entered the first room, a person who was there said to me, “Ah!\r\nyou are a brave woman; but where is that Thierry, that man loaded with\r\nhis master’s bounties?”\r\n\r\n[M. Thierry, who never ceased to give his sovereign proofs of unalterable\r\nattachment, was one of the victims of the 2d of September.--MADAME\r\nCAMPAN.]\r\n\r\n“He is here,” said I; “he is following me.  I perceive that even scenes\r\nof death do not banish jealousy from among you.”\r\n\r\nHaving belonged to the Court from my earliest youth, I was known to many\r\npersons whom I did not know.  As I traversed a corridor above the\r\ncloisters which led to the cells inhabited by the unfortunate Louis XVI.\r\nand his family, several of the grenadiers called me by name.  One of them\r\nsaid to me, “Well, the poor King is lost!  The Comte d’Artois would have\r\nmanaged it better.”--“Not at all,” said another.\r\n\r\nThe royal family occupied a small suite of apartments consisting of four\r\ncells, formerly belonging to the ancient monastery of the Feuillans.  In\r\nthe first were the men who had accompanied the King: the Prince de Poix,\r\nthe Baron d’Aubier, M. de Saint-Pardou, equerry to Madame Elisabeth, MM.\r\nde Goguelat, de Chamilly, and de Hue.  In the second we found the King; he\r\nwas having his hair dressed; he took two locks of it, and gave one to my\r\nsister and one to me.  We offered to kiss his hand; he opposed it, and\r\nembraced us without saying anything.  In the third was the Queen, in bed,\r\nand in indescribable affliction.  We found her accompanied only by a stout\r\nwoman, who appeared tolerably civil; she was the keeper of the apartments.\r\nShe waited upon the Queen, who as yet had none of her own people about\r\nher.  Her Majesty stretched out her arms to us, saying, “Come, unfortunate\r\nwomen; come, and see one still more unhappy than yourselves, since she has\r\nbeen the cause of all your misfortunes.  We are ruined,” continued she;\r\n“we have arrived at that point to which they have been leading us for\r\nthree years, through all possible outrages; we shall fall in this dreadful\r\nrevolution, and many others will perish after us. All have contributed to\r\nour downfall; the reformers have urged it like mad people, and others\r\nthrough ambition, for the wildest Jacobin seeks wealth and office, and the\r\nmob is eager for plunder.  There is not one real patriot among all this\r\ninfamous horde.  The emigrant party have their intrigues and schemes;\r\nforeigners seek to profit by the dissensions of France; every one has a\r\nshare in our misfortunes.”\r\n\r\nThe Dauphin came in with Madame and the Marquise de Tourzel.  On seeing\r\nthem the Queen said to me, “Poor children!  how heartrending it is,\r\ninstead of handing down to them so fine an inheritance, to say it ends\r\nwith us!”  She afterwards conversed with me about the Tuileries and the\r\npersons who had fallen; she condescended also to mention the burning of my\r\nhouse.  I looked upon that loss as a mischance which ought not to dwell\r\nupon her mind, and I told her so.  She spoke of the Princesse de Tarente,\r\nwhom she greatly loved and valued, of Madame de la Roche-Aymon and her\r\ndaughter, of the other persons whom she had left at the palace, and of the\r\nDuchesse de Luynes, who was to have passed the night at the Tuileries.\r\nRespecting her she said, “Hers was one of the first heads turned by the\r\nrage for that mischievous philosophy; but her heart brought her back, and\r\nI again found a friend in her.”\r\n\r\n[During the Reign of Terror I withdrew to the Chateau de Coubertin, near\r\nthat of Dampierre.  The Duchesse de Luynes frequently came to ask me to\r\ntell her what the Queen had said about her at the Feuillans.  She would\r\nsay as she went away, “I have often need to request you to repeat those\r\nwords of the Queen.”--MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nI asked the Queen what the ambassadors from foreign powers had done under\r\nexisting circumstances.  She told me that they could do nothing; and that\r\nthe wife of the English ambassador had just given her a proof of the\r\npersonal interest she took in her welfare by sending her linen for her\r\nson.\r\n\r\nI informed her that, in the pillaging of my house, all my accounts with\r\nher had been thrown into the Carrousel, and that every sheet of my month’s\r\nexpenditure was signed by her, sometimes leaving four or five inches of\r\nblank paper above her signature, a circumstance which rendered me very\r\nuneasy, from an apprehension that an improper use might be made of those\r\nsignatures.  She desired me to demand admission to the committee of\r\ngeneral safety, and to make this declaration there.  I repaired thither\r\ninstantly and found a deputy, with whose name I have never become\r\nacquainted.  After hearing me he said that he would not receive my\r\ndeposition; that Marie Antoinette was now nothing more than any other\r\nFrenchwoman; and that if any of those detached papers bearing her\r\nsignature should be misapplied, she would have, at a future period, a\r\nright to lodge a complaint, and to support her declaration by the facts\r\nwhich I had just related.  The Queen then regretted having sent me, and\r\nfeared that she had, by her very caution, pointed out a method of\r\nfabricating forgeries which might be dangerous to her; then again she\r\nexclaimed, “My apprehensions are as absurd as the step I made you take.\r\nThey need nothing more for our ruin; all has been told.”\r\n\r\nShe gave us details of what had taken place subsequently to the King’s\r\narrival at the Assembly.  They are all well known, and I have no occasion\r\nto record them; I will merely mention that she told us, though with much\r\ndelicacy, that she was not a little hurt at the King’s conduct since he\r\nhad quitted the Tuileries; that his habit of laying no restraint upon his\r\ngreat appetite had prompted him to eat as if he had been at his palace;\r\nthat those who did not know him as she did, did not feel the piety and the\r\nmagnanimity of his resignation, all which produced so bad an effect that\r\ndeputies who were devoted to him had warned him of it; but no change could\r\nbe effected.\r\n\r\nI still see in imagination, and shall always see, that narrow cell at the\r\nFeuillans, hung with green paper, that wretched couch whence the\r\ndethroned, Queen stretched out her arms to us, saying that our\r\nmisfortunes, of which she was the cause, increased her own.  There, for\r\nthe last time, I saw the tears, I heard the sobs of her whom high birth,\r\nnatural endowments, and, above all, goodness of heart, had seemed to\r\ndestine to adorn any throne, and be the happiness of any people!  It is\r\nimpossible for those who lived with Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette not to\r\nbe fully convinced, while doing full justice to the King’s virtues, that\r\nif the Queen had been from the moment of her arrival in France the object\r\nof the care and affection of a prince of decision and authority, she would\r\nhave only added to the glory of his reign.\r\n\r\nWhat affecting things I have heard the Queen say in the affliction caused\r\nher by the belief of part of the Court and the whole of the people that\r\nshe did not love France!  How did that opinion shock those who knew her\r\nheart and her sentiments!  Twice did I see her on the point of going from\r\nher apartments in the Tuileries into the gardens, to address the immense\r\nthrong constantly assembled there to insult her.  “Yes,” exclaimed she, as\r\nshe paced her chamber with hurried steps, “I will say to them Frenchmen,\r\nthey have had the cruelty to persuade you that I do not love France!--I!\r\nthe mother of a Dauphin who will reign over this noble country!--I! whom\r\nProvidence has seated upon the most powerful throne of Europe!  Of all the\r\ndaughters of Maria Theresa am I not that one whom fortune has most highly\r\nfavoured?  And ought I not to feel all these advantages?  What should I\r\nfind at Vienna?  Nothing but sepulchres!  What should I lose in France?\r\nEverything which can confer glory!”\r\n\r\nI protest I only repeat her own words; the soundness of her judgment soon\r\npointed out to her the dangers of such a proceeding.  “I should descend\r\nfrom the throne,” said she, “merely, perhaps, to excite a momentary\r\nsympathy, which the factious would soon render more injurious than\r\nbeneficial to me.”\r\n\r\nYes, not only did Marie Antoinette love France, but few women took greater\r\npride in the courage of Frenchmen.  I could adduce a multitude of proofs\r\nof this; I will relate two traits which demonstrate the noblest\r\nenthusiasm: The Queen was telling me that, at the coronation of the\r\nEmperor Francis II., that Prince, bespeaking the admiration of a French\r\ngeneral officer, who was then an emigrant, for the fine appearance of his\r\ntroops, said to him, “There are the men to beat your sans culottes!” “That\r\nremains to be seen, Sire,” instantly replied the officer.  The Queen\r\nadded, “I don’t know the name of that brave Frenchman, but I will learn\r\nit; the King ought to be in possession of it.”  As she was reading the\r\npublic papers a few days before the 10th of August, she observed that\r\nmention was made of the courage of a young man who died in defending the\r\nflag he carried, and shouting, “Vive la Nation!”--“Ah! the fine lad!” said\r\nthe Queen; “what a happiness it would have been for us if such men had\r\nnever left off crying, ‘Vive de Roi!’”\r\n\r\nIn all that I have hitherto said of this most unfortunate of women and of\r\nqueens, those who did not live with her, those who knew her but partially,\r\nand especially the majority of foreigners, prejudiced by infamous libels,\r\nmay imagine I have thought it my duty to sacrifice truth on the altar of\r\ngratitude.  Fortunately I can invoke unexceptionable witnesses; they will\r\ndeclare whether what I assert that I have seen and heard appears to them\r\neither untrue or improbable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Queen having been robbed of her purse as she was passing from the\r\nTuileries to the Feuillans, requested my sister to lend her twenty-five\r\nlouis.\r\n\r\n[On being interrogated the Queen declared that these five and twenty louis\r\nhad been lent to her by my sister; this formed a pretence for arresting\r\nher and me, and led to her death.--MADAME CAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nI spent part of the day at the Feuillans, and her Majesty told me she\r\nwould ask Potion to let me be with her in the place which the Assembly\r\nshould decree for her prison.  I then returned home to prepare everything\r\nthat might be necessary for me to accompany her.\r\n\r\nOn the same day (11th August), at nine in the evening, I returned to the\r\nFeuillans.  I found there were orders at all the gates forbidding my being\r\nadmitted.  I claimed a right to enter by virtue of the first permission\r\nwhich had been given to me; I was again refused.  I was told that the\r\nQueen had as many people as were requisite about her.  My sister was with\r\nher, as well as one of my companions, who came out of the prisons of the\r\nAbbaye on the 11th.  I renewed my solicitations on the 12th; my tears and\r\nentreaties moved neither the keepers of the gates, nor even a deputy, to\r\nwhom I addressed myself.\r\n\r\nI soon heard of the removal of Louis XVI. and his family to the Temple. I\r\nwent to Potion accompanied by M. Valadon, for whom I had procured a place\r\nin the post-office, and who was devoted to me.  He determined to go up to\r\nPotion alone; he told him that those who requested to be confined could\r\nnot be suspected of evil designs, and that no political opinion could\r\nafford a ground of objection to these solicitations.  Seeing that the\r\nwell-meaning man did not succeed, I thought to do more in person; but\r\nPetion persisted in his refusal, and threatened to send me to La Force.\r\nThinking to give me a kind of consolation, he added I might be certain\r\nthat all those who were then with Louis XVI. and his family would not stay\r\nwith them long.  And in fact, two or three days afterwards the Princesse\r\nde Lamballe, Madame de Tourzel, her daughter, the Queen’s first woman, the\r\nfirst woman of the Dauphin and of Madame, M. de Chamilly, and M. de Hue\r\nwere carried off during the night and transferred to La Force. After the\r\ndeparture of the King and Queen for the Temple, my sister was detained a\r\nprisoner in the apartments their Majesties had quitted for twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nFrom this time I was reduced to the misery of having no further\r\nintelligence of my august and unfortunate mistress but through the medium\r\nof the newspapers or the National Guard, who did duty at the Temple.\r\n\r\nThe King and Queen said nothing to me at the Feuillans about the portfolio\r\nwhich had been deposited with me; no doubt they expected to see me again.\r\nThe minister Roland and the deputies composing the provisional government\r\nwere very intent on a search for papers belonging to their Majesties.\r\nThey had the whole of the Tuileries ransacked.  The infamous Robespierre\r\nbethought himself of M. Campan, the Queen’s private secretary, and said\r\nthat his death was feigned; that he was living unknown in some obscure\r\npart of France, and was doubtless the depositary of all the important\r\npapers.  In a great portfolio belonging to the King there had been found a\r\nsolitary letter from the Comte d’Artois, which, by its date, and the\r\nsubjects of which it treated, indicated the existence of a continued\r\ncorrespondence.  (This letter appeared among the documents used on the\r\ntrial of Louis XVI.)  A former preceptor of my son’s had studied with\r\nRobespierre; the latter, meeting him in the street, and knowing the\r\nconnection which had subsisted between him and the family of M. Campan,\r\nrequired him to say, upon his honour, whether he was certain of the death\r\nof the latter.  The man replied that M. Campan had died at La Briche in\r\n1791, and that he had seen him interred in the cemetery of Epinay.  “well,\r\nthen,” resumed Robespierre, “bring me the certificate of his burial at\r\ntwelve to-morrow; it is a document for which I have pressing occasion.”\r\n Upon hearing the deputy’s demand I instantly sent for a certificate of M.\r\nCampan’s burial, and Robespierre received it at nine o’clock the next\r\nmorning.  But I considered that, in thinking of my father-in-law, they\r\nwere coming very near me, the real depositary of these important papers.\r\nI passed days and nights in considering what I could do for the best under\r\nsuch circumstances.\r\n\r\nI was thus situated when the order to inform against those who had been\r\ndenounced as suspected on the 10th of August led to domiciliary visits. My\r\nservants were told that the people of the quarter in which I lived were\r\ntalking much of the search that would be made in my house, and came to\r\napprise me of it.  I heard that fifty armed men would make themselves\r\nmasters of M. Auguies house, where I then was.  I had just received this\r\nintelligence when M. Gougenot, the King’s maitre d’hotel and\r\nreceiver-general of the taxes, a man much attached to his sovereign, came\r\ninto my room wrapped in a ridingcloak, under which, with great difficulty,\r\nhe carried the King’s portfolio, which I had entrusted to him.  He threw\r\nit down at my feet, and said to me, “There is your deposit; I did not\r\nreceive it from our unfortunate King’s own hands; in delivering it to you\r\nI have executed my trust.”  After saying this he was about to withdraw. I\r\nstopped him, praying him to consult with me what I ought to do in such a\r\ntrying emergency.  He would not listen to my entreaties, or even hear me\r\ndescribe the course I intended to pursue.  I told him my abode was about\r\nto be surrounded; I imparted to him what the Queen had said to me about\r\nthe contents of the portfolio.  To all this he answered, “There it is;\r\ndecide for yourself; I will have no hand in it.”  Upon that I remained a\r\nfew seconds thinking, and my conduct was founded upon the following\r\nreasons.  I spoke aloud, although to myself; I walked about the room with\r\nagitated steps; M. Gougenot was thunderstruck.  “Yes,” said I, “when we\r\ncan no longer communicate with our King and receive his orders, however\r\nattached we may be to him, we can only serve him according to the best of\r\nour own judgment.  The Queen said to me, ‘This portfolio contains scarcely\r\nanything but documents of a most dangerous description in the event of a\r\ntrial taking place, if it should fall into the hands of revolutionary\r\npersons.’  She mentioned, too, a single document which would, under the\r\nsame circumstances, be useful.  It is my duty to interpret her words, and\r\nconsider them as orders.  She meant to say, ‘You will save such a paper,\r\nyou will destroy the rest if they are likely to be taken from you.’  If it\r\nwere not so, was there any occasion for her to enter into any detail as to\r\nwhat the portfolio contained?  The order to keep it was sufficient.\r\nProbably it contains, moreover, the letters of that part of the family\r\nwhich has emigrated; there is nothing which may have been foreseen or\r\ndecided upon that can be useful now; and there can be no political thread\r\nwhich has not been cut by the events of the 10th of August and the\r\nimprisonment of the King.  My house is about to be surrounded; I cannot\r\nconceal anything of such bulk; I might, then, through want of foresight,\r\ngive up that which would cause the condemnation of the King.  Let us open\r\nthe portfolio, save the document alluded to, and destroy the rest.”  I\r\ntook a knife and cut open one side of the portfolio.  I saw a great number\r\nof envelopes endorsed by the King’s own hand.  M. Gougenot found there the\r\nformer seals of the King, such as they were before the Assembly had\r\nchanged the inscription.\r\n\r\n[No doubt it was in order to have the ancient seals ready at a moment’s\r\nnotice, in case of a counter-revolution, that the Queen desired me not to\r\nquit the Tuileries.  M. Gougenot threw the seals into the river, one from\r\nabove the Pont Neuf, and the other from near the Pont Royal.--MADAME\r\nCAMPAN.]\r\n\r\nAt this moment we heard a great noise; he agreed to tie up the portfolio,\r\ntake it again under his cloak, and go to a safe place to execute what I\r\nhad taken upon me to determine.  He made me swear, by all I held most\r\nsacred, that I would affirm, under every possible emergency, that the\r\ncourse I was pursuing had not been dictated to me by anybody; and that,\r\nwhatever might be the result, I would take all the credit or all the blame\r\nupon myself.  I lifted up my hand and took the oath he required; he went\r\nout.  Half an hour afterwards a great number of armed men came to my\r\nhouse; they placed sentinels at all the outlets; they broke open\r\nsecretaires and closets of which they had not the keys; they ‘searched the\r\nflower-pots and boxes; they examined the cellars; and the commandant\r\nrepeatedly said, “Look particularly for papers.”  In the afternoon M.\r\nGougenot returned.  He had still the seals of France about him, and he\r\nbrought me a statement of all that he had burnt.\r\n\r\nThe portfolio contained twenty letters from Monsieur, eighteen or nineteen\r\nfrom the Comte d’Artois, seventeen from Madame Adelaide, eighteen from\r\nMadame Victoire, a great many letters from Comte Alexandre de Lameth, and\r\nmany from M. de Malesherbes, with documents annexed to them.  There were\r\nalso some from M. de Montmorin and other ex-ministers or ambassadors.\r\nEach correspondence had its title written in the King’s own hand upon the\r\nblank paper which contained it.  The most voluminous was that from\r\nMirabeau.  It was tied up with a scheme for an escape, which he thought\r\nnecessary.  M. Gougenot, who had skimmed over these letters with more\r\nattention than the rest, told me they were of so interesting a nature that\r\nthe King had no doubt kept them as documents exceedingly valuable for a\r\nhistory of his reign, and that the correspondence with the Princes, which\r\nwas entirely relative to what was going forward abroad, in concert with\r\nthe King, would have been fatal to him if it had been seized.  After he\r\nhad finished he placed in my hands the proces-verbal, signed by all the\r\nministers, to which the King attached so much importance, because he had\r\ngiven his opinion against the declaration of war; a copy of the letter\r\nwritten by the King to the Princes, his brothers, inviting them to return\r\nto France; an account of the diamonds which the Queen had sent to Brussels\r\n(these two documents were in my handwriting); and a receipt for four\r\nhundred thousand francs, under the hand of a celebrated banker.  This sum\r\nwas part of the eight hundred thousand francs which the Queen had\r\ngradually saved during her reign, out of her pension of three hundred\r\nthousand francs per annum, and out of the one hundred thousand francs\r\ngiven by way of present on the birth of the Dauphin.\r\n\r\nThis receipt, written on a very small piece of paper, was in the cover of\r\nan almanac.  I agreed with M. Gougenot, who was obliged by his office to\r\nreside in Paris, that he should retain the proces-verbal of the Council\r\nand the receipt for the four hundred thousand francs, and that we should\r\nwait either for orders or for the means of transmitting these documents to\r\nthe King or Queen; and I set out for Versailles.\r\n\r\nThe strictness of the precautions taken to guard the illustrious prisoners\r\nwas daily increased.  The idea that I could not inform the King of the\r\ncourse I had adopted of burning his papers, and the fear that I should not\r\nbe able to transmit to him that which he had pointed out as necessary,\r\ntormented me to such a degree that it is wonderful my health endured the\r\nstrain.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful trial drew near.  Official advocates were granted to the\r\nKing; the heroic virtue of M. de Malesherbes induced him to brave the most\r\nimminent dangers, either to save his master or to perish with him. I hoped\r\nalso to be able to find some means of informing his Majesty of what I had\r\nthought it right to do.  I sent a man, on whom I could rely, to Paris, to\r\nrequest M. Gougenot to come to me at Versailles he came immediately.  We\r\nagreed that he should see M. de Malesherbes without availing himself of\r\nany intermediate person for that purpose.\r\n\r\nM. Gougenot awaited his return from the Temple at the door of his hotel,\r\nand made a sign that he wished to speak to him.  A moment afterwards a\r\nservant came to introduce him into the magistrates’ room.  He imparted to\r\nM. de Malesherbes what I had thought it right to do with respect to the\r\nKing’s papers, and placed in his hands the proces-verbal of the Council,\r\nwhich his Majesty had preserved in order to serve, if occasion required\r\nit, for a ground of his defence.  However, that paper is not mentioned in\r\neither of the speeches of his advocate; probably it was determined not to\r\nmake use of it.\r\n\r\nI stop at that terrible period which is marked by the assassination of a\r\nKing whose virtues are well known; but I cannot refrain from relating what\r\nhe deigned to say in my favour to M. de Malesherbes:\r\n\r\n“Let Madame Campan know that she did what I should myself have ordered her\r\nto do; I thank her for it; she is one of those whom I regret I have it not\r\nin my power to recompense for their fidelity to my person, and for their\r\ngood services.”  I did not hear of this until the morning after he had\r\nsuffered, and I think I should have sunk under my despair if this\r\nhonourable testimony had not given me some consolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENT TO CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME CAMPAN’S narrative breaking off abruptly at the time of the painful\r\nend met with by her sister, we have supplemented it by abridged accounts\r\nof the chief incidents in the tragedy which overwhelmed the royal house\r\nshe so faithfully served, taken from contemporary records and the best\r\nhistorical authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal Family in the Temple.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly having, at the instance of the Commune of Paris, decreed that\r\nthe royal family should be immured in the Temple, they were removed\r\nthither from the Feuillans on the 13th of August, 1792, in the charge of\r\nPotion, Mayor of Paris, and Santerre, the commandant-general.  Twelve\r\nCommissioners of the general council were to keep constant watch at the\r\nTemple, which had been fortified by earthworks and garrisoned by\r\ndetachments of the National Guard, no person being allowed to enter\r\nwithout permission from the municipality.\r\n\r\nThe Temple, formerly the headquarters of the Knights Templars in Paris,\r\nconsisted of two buildings,--the Palace, facing the Rue de Temple, usually\r\noccupied by one of the Princes of the blood; and the Tower, standing\r\nbehind the Palace.\r\n\r\n[Clery gives a more minute description of this singular building: “The\r\nsmall tower of the Temple in which the King was then confined stood with\r\nits back against the great tower, without any interior communication, and\r\nformed a long square, flanked by two turrets.  In one of these turrets\r\nthere was a narrow staircase that led from the first floor to a gallery on\r\nthe platform; in the other were small rooms, answering to each story of\r\nthe tower.  The body of the building was four stories high.  The first\r\nconsisted of an antechamber, a dining-room, and a small room in the\r\nturret, where there was a library containing from twelve to fifteen\r\nhundred volumes.  The second story was divided nearly in the same manner.\r\nThe largest room was the Queen’s bedchamber, in which the Dauphin also\r\nslept; the second, which was separated from the Queen’s by a small\r\nantechamber almost without light, was occupied by Madame Royale and Madame\r\nElisabeth.  The King’s apartments were on the third story.  He slept in\r\nthe great room, and made a study of the turret closet.  There was a\r\nkitchen separated from the King’s chamber by a small dark room, which had\r\nbeen successively occupied by M. de Chamilly and M. de Hue.  The fourth\r\nstory was shut up; and on the ground floor there were kitchens of which no\r\nuse was made.”--“Journal,” p. 96.]\r\n\r\nThe Tower was a square building, with a round tower at each corner and a\r\nsmall turret on one side, usually called the Tourelle.  In the narrative\r\nof the Duchesse d’Angouleme she says that the soldiers who escorted the\r\nroyal prisoners wished to take the King alone to the Tower, and his family\r\nto the Palace of the Temple, but that on the way Manuel received an order\r\nto imprison them all in the Tower, where so little provision had been made\r\nfor their reception that Madame Elisabeth slept in the kitchen. The royal\r\nfamily were accompanied by the Princesse de Lamballe, Madame de Tourzel\r\nand her daughter Pauline, Mesdames de Navarre, de Saint-Brice, Thibaut,\r\nand Bazire, MM. de Hug and de Chamilly, and three men-servants--An order\r\nfrom the Commune soon removed these devoted attendants, and M. de Hue\r\nalone was permitted to return.  “We all passed the day together,” says\r\nMadame Royale.  “My father taught my brother geography; my mother history,\r\nand to learn verses by heart; and my aunt gave him lessons in arithmetic.\r\nMy father fortunately found a library which amused him, and my mother\r\nworked tapestry .  .  .  .  We went every day to walk in the garden, for\r\nthe sake of my brother’s health, though the King was always insulted by\r\nthe guard.  On the Feast of Saint Louis ‘Ca Ira’ was sung under the walls\r\nof the Temple.  Manuel that evening brought my aunt a letter from her\r\naunts at Rome.  It was the last the family received from without.  My\r\nfather was no longer called King.  He was treated with no kind of respect;\r\nthe officers always sat in his presence and never took off their hats.\r\nThey deprived him of his sword and searched his pockets .  .  .  .  Petion\r\nsent as gaoler the horrible man--[Rocher, a saddler by trade] who had\r\nbroken open my father’s door on the 20th June, 1792, and who had been near\r\nassassinating him.  This man never left the Tower, and was indefatigable\r\nin endeavouring to torment him.  One time he would sing the ‘Caramgnole,’\r\nand a thousand other horrors, before us; again, knowing that my mother\r\ndisliked the smoke of tobacco, he would puff it in her face, as well as in\r\nthat of my father, as they happened to pass him. He took care always to be\r\nin bed before we went to supper, because he knew that we must pass through\r\nhis room.  My father suffered it all with gentleness, forgiving the man\r\nfrom the bottom of his heart.  My mother bore it with a dignity that\r\nfrequently repressed his insolence.” The only occasion, Madame Royale\r\nadds, on which the Queen showed any impatience at the conduct of the\r\nofficials, was when a municipal officer woke the Dauphin suddenly in the\r\nnight to make certain that he was safe, as though the sight of the\r\npeacefully sleeping child would not have been in itself the best\r\nassurance.\r\n\r\nClery, the valet de chambre of the Dauphin, having with difficulty\r\nobtained permission to resume his duties, entered the Temple on the 24th\r\nAugust, and for eight days shared with M. de Hue the personal attendance;\r\nbut on the 2d September De Hue was arrested, seals were placed on the\r\nlittle room he had occupied, and Clery passed the night in that of the\r\nKing.  On the following morning Manuel arrived, charged by the Commune to\r\ninform the King that De Hue would not be permitted to return, and to offer\r\nto send another person.  “I thank you,” answered the King.  “I will manage\r\nwith the valet de chambre of my son; and if the Council refuse I will\r\nserve myself.  I am determined to do it.”  On the 3d September Manual\r\nvisited the Temple and assured the King that Madame de Lamballe and all\r\nthe other prisoners who had been removed to La Force were well, and safely\r\nguarded.  “But at three o’clock,” says Madame Royale, “just after dinner,\r\nand as the King was sitting down to ‘tric trac’ with my mother (which he\r\nplayed for the purpose of having an opportunity of saying a few words to\r\nher unheard by the keepers), the most horrid shouts were heard.  The\r\nofficer who happened to be on guard in the room behaved well. He shut the\r\ndoor and the window, and even drew the curtains to prevent their seeing\r\nanything; but outside the workmen and the gaoler Rocher joined the\r\nassassins and increased the tumult.  Several officers of the guard and the\r\nmunicipality now arrived, and on my father’s asking what was the matter, a\r\nyoung officer replied, ‘Well, since you will know, it is the head of\r\nMadame de Lamballe that they want to show you.’ At these words my mother\r\nwas overcome with horror; it was the only occasion on which her firmness\r\nabandoned her.  The municipal officers were very angry with the young man;\r\nbut the King, with his usual goodness, excused him, saying that it was his\r\nown fault, since he had questioned the officer.  The noise lasted till\r\nfive o’clock.  We learned that the people had wished to force the door,\r\nand that the municipal officers had been enabled to prevent it only by\r\nputting a tricoloured scarf across it, and allowing six of the murderers\r\nto march round our prison with the head of the Princess, leaving at the\r\ndoor her body, which they would have dragged in also.”\r\n\r\nClery was not so fortunate as to escape the frightful spectacle.  He had\r\ngone down to dine with Tison and his wife, employed as servants in the\r\nTemple, and says: “We were hardly seated when a head, on the end of a\r\npike, was presented at the window.  Tison’s wife gave a great cry; the\r\nassassins fancied they recognised the Queen’s voice, and responded by\r\nsavage laughter.  Under the idea that his Majesty was still at table, they\r\nplaced their dreadful trophy where it must be seen.  It was the head of\r\nthe Princesse de Lamballe; although bleeding, it was not disfigured, and\r\nher light hair, still in curls, hung about the pike.”\r\n\r\nAt length the immense mob that surrounded the Temple gradually withdrew,\r\n“to follow the head of the Princess de Lamballe to the Palais Royal.”\r\n\r\n[The pike that bore the head was fixed before the Duc d’Orleans’s window\r\nas he was going to dinner.  It is said that he looked at this horrid sight\r\nwithout horror, went into the dining-room, sat down to table, and helped\r\nhis guests without saying a word.  His silence and coolness left it\r\ndoubtful whether the assassins, in presenting him this bloody trophy,\r\nintended to offer him an insult or to pay him homage.--DE MOLLEVILLE’S\r\n“Annals of the French Revolution,” vol. vii., p.  398.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the royal family could scarcely believe that for the time their\r\nlives were saved.  “My aunt and I heard the drums beating to arms all\r\nnight,” says Madame Royale; “my unhappy mother did not even attempt to\r\nsleep.  We heard her sobs.”\r\n\r\nIn the comparative tranquillity which followed the September massacres,\r\nthe royal family resumed the regular habits they had adopted on entering\r\nthe Temple.  “The King usually rose at six in the morning,” says Clery.\r\n“He shaved himself, and I dressed his hair; he then went to his\r\nreading-room, which, being very small, the municipal officer on duty\r\nremained in the bedchamber with the door open, that he might always keep\r\nthe King in sight.  His Majesty continued praying on his knees for some\r\ntime, and then read till nine.  During that interval, after putting his\r\nchamber to rights and preparing the breakfast, I went down to the Queen,\r\nwho never opened her door till I arrived, in order to prevent the\r\nmunicipal officer from going into her apartment.  At nine o’clock the\r\nQueen, the children, and Madame Elisabeth went up to the King’s chamber to\r\nbreakfast.  At ten the King and his family went down to the Queen’s\r\nchamber, and there passed the day.  He employed himself in educating his\r\nson, made him recite passages from Corneille and Racine, gave him lessons\r\nin geography, and exercised him in colouring the maps.  The Queen, on her\r\npart, was employed in the education of her daughter, and these different\r\nlessons lasted till eleven o’clock.  The remaining time till noon was\r\npassed in needlework, knitting, or making tapestry.  At one o’clock, when\r\nthe weather was fine, the royal family were conducted to the garden by\r\nfour municipal officers and the commander of a legion of the National\r\nGuard. As there were a number of workmen in the Temple employed in pulling\r\ndown houses and building new walls, they only allowed a part of the\r\nchestnut-tree walk for the promenade, in which I was allowed to share, and\r\nwhere I also played with the young Prince at ball, quoits, or races.  At\r\ntwo we returned to the Tower, where I served the dinner, at which time\r\nSanterre regularly came to the Temple, attended by two aides-de-camp.  The\r\nKing sometimes spoke to him,--the Queen never.\r\n\r\n“After the meal the royal family came down into the Queen’s room, and\r\ntheir Majesties generally played a game of piquet or tric-trac.  At four\r\no’clock the King took a little repose, the Princesses round him, each with\r\na book .  .  .  .  When the King woke the conversation was resumed, and I\r\ngave writing lessons to his son, taking the copies, according to his\r\ninstructions, from the works of, Montesquieu and other celebrated authors.\r\nAfter the lesson I took the young Prince into Madame Elisabeth’s room,\r\nwhere we played at ball, and battledore and shuttlecock.  In the evening\r\nthe family sat round a table, while the Queen read to them from books of\r\nhistory, or other works proper to instruct and amuse the children.  Madame\r\nElisabeth took the book in her turn, and in this manner they read till\r\neight o’clock.  After that I served the supper of the young Prince, in\r\nwhich the royal family shared, and the King amused the children with\r\ncharades out of a collection of French papers which he found in the\r\nlibrary.  After the Dauphin had supped, I undressed him, and the Queen\r\nheard him say his prayers.  At nine the King went to supper, and\r\nafterwards went for a moment to the Queen’s chamber, shook hands with her\r\nand his sister for the night, kissed his children, and then retired to the\r\nturret-room, where he sat reading till midnight.  The Queen and the\r\nPrincesses locked themselves in, and one of the municipal officers\r\nremained in the little room which parted their chamber, where he passed\r\nthe night; the other followed his Majesty.  In this manner was the time\r\npassed as long as the King remained in the small tower.”\r\n\r\nBut even these harmless pursuits were too often made the means of further\r\ninsulting and thwarting the unfortunate family.  Commissary Le Clerc\r\ninterrupted the Prince’s writing lessons, proposing to substitute\r\nRepublican works for those from which the King selected his copies. A\r\nsmith, who was present when the Queen was reading the history of France to\r\nher children, denounced her to the Commune for choosing the period when\r\nthe Connstable de Bourbon took arms against France, and said she wished to\r\ninspire her son with unpatriotic feelings; a municipal officer asserted\r\nthat the multiplication table the Prince was studying would afford a means\r\nof “speaking in cipher,” so arithmetic had to be abandoned.  Much the same\r\noccurred even with the needlework, the Queen and Princess finished some\r\nchairbacks, which they wished to send to the Duchesse de Tarente; but the\r\nofficials considered that the patterns were hieroglyphics, intended for\r\ncarrying on a correspondence, and ordered that none of the Princesses work\r\nshould leave the Temple. The short daily walk in the garden was also\r\nembittered by the rude behaviour of the military and municipal gaolers;\r\nsometimes, however, it afforded an opportunity for marks of sympathy to be\r\nshown.  People would station themselves at the windows of houses\r\noverlooking the Temple gardens, and evince by gestures their loyal\r\naffection, and some of the sentinels showed, even by tears, that their\r\nduty was painful to them.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st September the National Convention was constituted, Petion\r\nbeing made president and Collot d’Herbois moving the “abolition of\r\nroyalty” amidst transports of applause.  That afternoon a municipal\r\nofficer attended by gendarmes a cheval, and followed by a crowd of people,\r\narrived at the Temple, and, after a flourish of trumpets, proclaimed the\r\nestablishment of the French Republic.  The man, says Clery, “had the voice\r\nof a Stentor.”  The royal family could distinctly hear the announcement of\r\nthe King’s deposition.  “Hebert, so well known under the title of Pere\r\nDuchesne, and Destournelles were on guard.  They were sitting near the\r\ndoor, and turned to the King with meaning smiles. He had a book in his\r\nhand, and went on reading without changing countenance.  The Queen showed\r\nthe same firmness.  The proclamation finished, the trumpets sounded\r\nafresh.  I went to the window; the people took me for Louis XVI. and I was\r\noverwhelmed with insults.”\r\n\r\nAfter the new decree the prisoners were treated with increased harshness.\r\nPens, paper, ink, and pencils were taken from them.  The King and Madame\r\nElisabeth gave up all, but the Queen and her daughter each concealed a\r\npencil.  “In the beginning of October,” says Madame Royale, “after my\r\nfather had supped, he was told to stop, that he was not to return to his\r\nformer apartments, and that he was to be separated from his family.  At\r\nthis dreadful sentence the Queen lost her usual courage.  We parted from\r\nhim with abundance of tears, though we expected to see him again in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n[At nine o’clock, says Clery, the King asked to be taken to his family,\r\nbut the municipal officers replied that they had “no orders for that.”\r\n Shortly afterwards a boy brought the King some bread and a decanter of\r\nlemonade for his breakfast.  The King gave half the bread to Clery,\r\nsaying, “It seems they have forgotten your breakfast; take this, the rest\r\nis enough for me.”  Clery refused, but the King insisted.  “I could not\r\ncontain my tears,” he adds; “the King perceived them, and his own fell\r\nalso.”]\r\n\r\nThey brought in our breakfast separately from his, however.  My mother\r\nwould take nothing.  The officers, alarmed at her silent and concentrated\r\nsorrow, allowed us to see the King, but at meal-times only, and on\r\ncondition that we should not speak low, nor in any foreign language, but\r\nloud and in ‘good French.’  We went down, therefore, with the greatest joy\r\nto dine with my father.  In the evening, when my brother was in bed, my\r\nmother and my aunt alternately sat with him or went with me to sup with my\r\nfather.  In the morning, after breakfast, we remained in the King’s\r\napartments while Clery dressed our hair, as he was no longer allowed to\r\ncome to my mother’s room, and this arrangement gave us the pleasure of\r\nspending a few moments more with my father.”\r\n\r\n[When the first deputation from the Council of the Commune visited the\r\nTemple, and formally inquired whether the King had any complaint to make,\r\nhe replied, “No; while he was permitted to remain with his family he was\r\nhappy.”]\r\n\r\nThe royal prisoners had no comfort except their affection for each other.\r\nAt that time even common necessaries were denied them.  Their small stock\r\nof linen had been lent them; by persons of the Court during the time they\r\nspent at the Feuillans.  The Princesses mended their clothes every day,\r\nand after the King had gone to bed Madame Elisabeth mended his.  “With\r\nmuch trouble,” says Clrry, “I procured some fresh linen for them.  But the\r\nworkwomen having marked it with crowned letters, the Princesses were\r\nordered to pick them out.”  The room in the great tower to which the King\r\nhad been removed contained only one bed, and no other article of\r\nfurniture.  A chair was brought on which Clery spent the first night;\r\npainters were still at work on the room, and the smell of the paint, he\r\nsays, was almost unbearable.  This room was afterwards furnished by\r\ncollecting from various parts of the Temple a chest of drawers, a small\r\nbureau, a few odd chairs, a chimney-glass, and a bed hung with green\r\ndamask, which had been used by the captain of the guard to the Comte\r\nd’Artois.  A room for the Queen was being prepared over that of the King,\r\nand she implored the workmen to finish it quickly, but it was not ready\r\nfor her occupation for some time, and when she was allowed to remove to it\r\nthe Dauphin was taken from her and placed with his father.  When their\r\nMajesties met again in the great Tower, says Clery, there was little\r\nchange in the hours fixed for meals, reading, walking and the education of\r\ntheir children.  They were not allowed to have mass said in the Temple,\r\nand therefore commissioned Clery to get them the breviary in use in the\r\ndiocese of Paris.  Among the books read by the King while in the Tower\r\nwere Hume’s “History of England” (in the original), Tasso, and the “De\r\nImitatione Christi.”  The jealous suspicions of the municipal officers led\r\nto the most absurd investigations; a draught-board was taken to pieces\r\nlest the squares should hide treasonable papers; macaroons were broken in\r\nhalf to see that they did not contain letters; peaches were cut open and\r\nthe stones cracked; and Clery was compelled to drink the essence of soap\r\nprepared for shaving the King, under the pretence that it might contain\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nIn November the King and all the family had feverish colds, and Clery had\r\nan attack of rheumatic fever.  On the first day of his illness he got up\r\nand tried to dress his master, but the King, seeing how ill he was,\r\nordered him to lie down, and himself dressed the Dauphin.  The little\r\nPrince waited on Clery all day, and in the evening the King contrived to\r\napproach his bed, and said, in a low voice, “I should like to take care of\r\nyou myself, but you know how we are watched.  Take courage; tomorrow you\r\nshall see my doctor.”  Madame Elisabeth brought the valet cooling\r\ndraughts, of which she deprived herself; and after Clery was able to get\r\nup, the young Prince one night with great difficulty kept awake till\r\neleven o’clock in order to give him a box of lozenges when he went to make\r\nthe King’s bed.\r\n\r\nOn 7th December a deputation from the Commune brought an order that the\r\nroyal family should be deprived of “knives, razors, scissors, penknives,\r\nand all other cutting instruments.”  The King gave up a knife, and took\r\nfrom a morocco case a pair of scissors and a penknife; and the officials\r\nthen searched the room, taking away the little toilet implements of gold\r\nand silver, and afterwards removing the Princesses’ working materials.\r\nReturning to the King’s room, they insisted upon seeing what remained in\r\nhis pocket-case.  “Are these toys which I have in my hand also cutting\r\ninstruments?”  asked the King, showing them a cork-screw, a turn-screw,\r\nand a steel for lighting.  These also were taken from him.  Shortly\r\nafterwards Madame Elisabeth was mending the King’s coat, and, having no\r\nscissors, was compelled to break the thread with her teeth.\r\n\r\n“What a contrast!” he exclaimed, looking at her tenderly.  “You wanted\r\nnothing in your pretty house at Montreuil.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, brother,” she answered, “how can I have any regret when I partake\r\nyour misfortunes?”\r\n\r\nThe Queen had frequently to take on herself some of the humble duties of a\r\nservant.  This was especially painful to Louis XVI. when the anniversary\r\nof some State festival brought the contrast between past and present with\r\nunusual keenness before him.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Madame,” he once exclaimed, “what an employment for a Queen of\r\nFrance!  Could they see that at Vienna!  Who would have foreseen that, in\r\nuniting your lot to mine, you would have descended so low?”\r\n\r\n“And do you esteem as nothing,” she replied, “the glory of being the wife\r\nof one of the best and most persecuted of men?  Are not such misfortunes\r\nthe noblest honours?”--[Alison’s “History of Europe,” vol. ii., p. 299.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Assembly had decided that the King should be brought to\r\ntrial.  Nearly all parties, except the Girondists, no matter how bitterly\r\nopposed to each other, could agree in making him the scapegoat; and the\r\nfirst rumour of the approaching ordeal was conveyed to the Temple by\r\nClery’s wife, who, with a friend, had permission occasionally to visit\r\nhim.  “I did not know how to announce this terrible news to the King,” he\r\nsays; “but time was pressing, and he had forbidden my concealing anything\r\nfrom him.  In the evening, while undressing him, I gave him an account of\r\nall I had learnt, and added that there were only four days to concert some\r\nplan of corresponding with the Queen.  The arrival of the municipal\r\nofficer would not allow me to say more.  Next morning, when the King rose,\r\nI could not get a moment for speaking with him.  He went up with his son\r\nto breakfast with the Princesses, and I followed.  After breakfast he\r\ntalked long with the Queen, who, by a look full of trouble, made me\r\nunderstand that they were discussing what I had told the King. During the\r\nday I found an opportunity of describing to Madame Elisabeth how much it\r\nhad cost me to augment the King’s distresses by informing him of his\r\napproaching trial.  She reassured me, saying that the King felt this as a\r\nmark of attachment on my part, and added, ‘That which most troubles him is\r\nthe fear of being separated from us.’  In the evening the King told me how\r\nsatisfied he was at having had warning that he was to appear before the\r\nConvention.  ‘Continue,’ he said, ‘to endeavour to find out something as\r\nto what they want to do with me.  Never fear distressing me.  I have\r\nagreed with my family not to seem pre-informed, in order not to compromise\r\nyou.’”\r\n\r\nOn the 11th December, at five o’clock in the morning, the prisoners heard\r\nthe generale beaten throughout Paris, and cavalry and cannon entered the\r\nTemple gardens.  At nine the King and the Dauphin went as usual to\r\nbreakfast with the Queen.  They were allowed to remain together for an\r\nhour, but constantly under the eyes of their republican guardians.  At\r\nlast they were obliged to part, doubtful whether they would ever see each\r\nother again.  The little Prince, who remained with his father, and was\r\nignorant of the new cause for anxiety, begged hard that the King would\r\nplay at ninepins with him as usual.  Twice the Dauphin could not get\r\nbeyond a certain number.  “Each time that I get up to sixteen,” he said,\r\nwith some vexation, “I lose the game.”  The King did not reply, but Clery\r\nfancied the words made a painful impression on him.\r\n\r\nAt eleven, while the King was giving the Dauphin a reading lesson, two\r\nmunicipal officers entered and said they had come “to take young Louis to\r\nhis mother.”  The King inquired why, but was only told that such were the\r\norders of the Council.  At one o’clock the Mayor of Paris, Chambon,\r\naccompanied by Chaumette, Procureur de la Commune, Santerre, commandant of\r\nthe National Guard, and others, arrived at the Temple and read a decree to\r\nthe King, which ordered that “Louis Capet” should be brought before the\r\nConvention.  “Capet is not my name,” he replied, “but that of one of my\r\nancestors.  I could have wished,” he added, “that you had left my son with\r\nme during the last two hours.  But this treatment is consistent with all I\r\nhave experienced here.  I follow you, not because I recognise the\r\nauthority of the Convention, but because I can be compelled to obey it.”\r\n He then followed the Mayor to a carriage which waited, with a numerous\r\nescort, at the gate of the Temple.  The family left behind were\r\noverwhelmed with grief and apprehension.  “It is impossible to describe\r\nthe anxiety we suffered,” says Madame Royale.  “My mother used every\r\nendeavour with the officer who guarded her to discover what was passing;\r\nit was the first time she had condescended to question any of these men.\r\nHe would tell her nothing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrial of the King.--Parting of the Royal Family.--Execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crowd was immense as, on the morning of the 11th December, 1792, Louis\r\nXVI. was driven slowly from the Temple to the Convention, escorted by\r\ncavalry, infantry, and artillery.  Paris looked like an armed camp: all\r\nthe posts were doubled; the muster-roll of the National Guard was called\r\nover every hour; a picket of two hundred men watched in the court of each\r\nof the right sections; a reserve with cannon was stationed at the\r\nTuileries, and strong detachments patroled the streets and cleared the\r\nroad of all loiterers.  The trees that lined the boulevards, the doors and\r\nwindows of the houses, were alive with gazers, and all eyes were fixed on\r\nthe King.  He was much changed since his people last beheld him. The beard\r\nhe had been compelled to grow after his razors were taken from him covered\r\ncheeks, lips, and chin with light-coloured hair, which concealed the\r\nmelancholy expression of his mouth; he had become thin, and his garments\r\nhung loosely on him; but his manner was perfectly collected and calm, and\r\nhe recognised and named to the Mayor the various quarters through which he\r\npassed.  On arriving at the Feuillans he was taken to a room to await the\r\norders of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt was about half-past two when the King appeared at the bar.  The Mayor\r\nand Generaux Santerre and Wittengoff were at his side.  Profound silence\r\npervaded the Assembly.  All were touched by the King’s dignity and the\r\ncomposure of his looks under so great a reverse of fortune.  By nature he\r\nhad been formed rather to endure calamity with patience than to contend\r\nagainst it with energy.  The approach of death could not disturb his\r\nserenity.\r\n\r\n“Louis, you may be seated,” said Barere.  “Answer the questions that shall\r\nbe put to you.”  The King seated himself and listened to the reading of\r\nthe ‘acte enonciatif’, article by article.  All the faults of the Court\r\nwere there enumerated and imputed to Louis XVI. personally. He was charged\r\nwith the interruption of the sittings of the 20th of June, 1789, with the\r\nBed of Justice held on the 23d of the same month, the aristocratic\r\nconspiracy thwarted by the insurrection of the 14th of July, the\r\nentertainment of the Life Guards, the insults offered to the national\r\ncockade, the refusal to sanction the Declaration of Rights, as well as\r\nseveral constitutional articles; lastly, all the facts which indicated a\r\nnew conspiracy in October, and which were followed by the scenes of the\r\n5th and 6th; the speeches of reconciliation which had succeeded all these\r\nscenes, and which promised a change that was not sincere; the false oath\r\ntaken at the Federation of the 14th of July; the secret practices of Talon\r\nand Mirabeau to effect a counter-revolution; the money spent in bribing a\r\ngreat number of deputies; the assemblage of the “knights of the dagger” on\r\nthe 28th of February, 1791; the flight to Varennes; the fusilade of the\r\nChamp de Mars; the silence observed respecting the Treaty of Pilnitz; the\r\ndelay in the promulgation of the decree which incorporated Avignon with\r\nFrance; the commotions at Nimes, Montauban, Mende, and Jales; the\r\ncontinuance of their pay to the emigrant Life Guards and to the disbanded\r\nConstitutional Guard; the insufficiency of the armies assembled on the\r\nfrontiers; the refusal to sanction the decree for the camp of twenty\r\nthousand men; the disarming of the fortresses; the organisation of secret\r\nsocieties in the interior of Paris; the review of the Swiss and the\r\ngarrison of the palace on the 10th August; the summoning the Mayor to the\r\nTuileries; and lastly, the effusion of blood which had resulted from these\r\nmilitary dispositions.  After each article the President paused, and said,\r\n“What have you to answer?”  The King, in a firm voice, denied some of the\r\nfacts, imputed others to his ministers, and always appealed to the\r\nconstitution, from which he declared he had never deviated.  His answers\r\nwere very temperate, but on the charge, “You spilt the blood of the people\r\non the 10th of August,” he exclaimed, with emphasis, “No, monsieur, no; it\r\nwas not I.”\r\n\r\nAll the papers on which the act of accusation was founded were then shown\r\nto the King, and he disavowed some of them and disputed the existence of\r\nthe iron chest; this produced a bad impression, and was worse than\r\nuseless, as the fact had been proved.\r\n\r\n[A secret closet which the King had directed to be constructed in a wall\r\nin the Tuileries.  The door was of iron, whence it was afterwards known by\r\nthe name of the iron chest.  See Thiers, and Scott.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the examination the King showed great presence of mind. He was\r\ncareful in his answers never to implicate any members of the constituent,\r\nand legislative Assemblies; many who then sat as his judges trembled lest\r\nhe should betray them.  The Jacobins beheld with dismay the profound\r\nimpression made on the Convention by the firm but mild demeanour of the\r\nsovereign.  The most violent of the party proposed that he should be\r\nhanged that very night; a laugh as of demons followed the proposal from\r\nthe benches of the Mountain, but the majority, composed of the Girondists\r\nand the neutrals, decided that he should be formally tried.\r\n\r\nAfter the examination  Santerre took the King by the arm and led him back\r\nto the waiting-room of the Convention, accompanied by Chambon and\r\nChaumette.  Mental agitation and the length of the proceedings had\r\nexhausted him, and he staggered from weakness.  Chaumette inquired if he\r\nwished for refreshment, but the King refused it.  A moment after, seeing a\r\ngrenadier of the escort offer the Procureur de la Commune half a small\r\nloaf, Louis XVI. approached and asked him, in a whisper, for a piece.\r\n\r\n“Ask aloud for what you want,” said Chaumette, retreating as though he\r\nfeared being suspected of pity.\r\n\r\n“I asked for a piece of your bread,” replied the King.\r\n\r\n“Divide it with me,” said Chaumette.  “It is a Spartan breakfast.  If I\r\nhad a root I would give you half.”--[Lamartine’s “History of the\r\nGirondists,” edit.  1870, vol. ii., p. 313.]\r\n\r\nSoon after six in the evening the King returned to the Temple.  “He seemed\r\ntired,” says Clery, simply, “and his first wish was to be led to his\r\nfamily.  The officers refused, on the plea that they had no orders. He\r\ninsisted that at least they should be informed of his return, and this was\r\npromised him.  The King ordered me to ask for his supper at half-past\r\neight.  The intervening hours he employed in his usual reading, surrounded\r\nby four municipals.  When I announced that supper was served, the King\r\nasked the commissaries if his family could not come down.  They made no\r\nreply.  ‘But at least,’ the King said, ‘my son will pass the night in my\r\nroom, his bed being here?’  The same silence.  After supper the King again\r\nurged his wish to see his family.  They answered that they must await the\r\ndecision of the Convention.  While I was undressing him the King said, ‘I\r\nwas far from expecting all the questions they put to me.’  He lay down\r\nwith perfect calmness.  The order for my removal during the night was not\r\nexecuted.”  On the King’s return to the Temple being known, “my mother\r\nasked to see him instantly,” writes Madame Royale. “She made the same\r\nrequest even to Chambon, but received no answer.  My brother passed the\r\nnight with her; and as he had no bed, she gave him hers, and sat up all\r\nthe night in such deep affliction that we were afraid to leave her; but\r\nshe compelled my aunt and me to go to bed.  Next day she again asked to\r\nsee my father, and to read the newspapers, that she might learn the course\r\nof the trial.  She entreated that if she was to be denied this indulgence,\r\nhis children, at least, might see him.  Her requests were referred to the\r\nCommune.  The newspapers were refused; but my brother and I were to be\r\nallowed to see my father on condition of being entirely separated from my\r\nmother.  My father replied that, great as his happiness was in seeing his\r\nchildren, the important business which then occupied him would not allow\r\nof his attending altogether to his son, and that his daughter could not\r\nleave her mother.”\r\n\r\n[During their last interview Madame Elisabeth had given Clery one of her\r\nhandkerchiefs, saying, “You shall keep it so long as my brother continues\r\nwell; if he becomes ill, send it to me among my nephew’s things.”]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly having, after a violent debate, resolved that Louis XVI.\r\nshould have the aid of counsel, a deputation was sent to the Temple to\r\nask whom he would choose.  The King named Messieurs Target and Tronchet.\r\nThe former refused his services on the ground that he had discontinued\r\npractice since 1785; the latter complied at once with the King’s\r\nrequest; and while the Assembly was considering whom to, nominate in\r\nTarget’s place, the President received a letter from the venerable\r\nMalesherbes, then seventy years old, and “the most respected magistrate\r\nin France,” in the course of which he said: “I have been twice called to\r\nbe counsel for him who was my master, in times when that duty was\r\ncoveted by every one. I owe him the same service now that it is a duty\r\nwhich many people deem dangerous.  If I knew any possible means of\r\nacquainting him with my desires, I should not take the liberty of\r\naddressing myself to you.”\r\n\r\n[Christian Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, an eminent French\r\nstatesman, son of the Chancellor of France, was born at Paris in 1721.  In\r\n1750 he succeeded his father as President of the Court of Aids, and was\r\nalso made superintendent of the press.  On the banishment of the\r\nParliaments and the suppression of the Court of Aids, Malesherbes was\r\nexiled to his country-seat.  In 1775 he was appointed Minister of State.\r\nOn the decree of the Convention for the King’s trial, he emerged from his\r\nretreat to become the voluntary advocate of his sovereign.  Malesherbes\r\nwas guillotined in 1794, and almost his whole family were extirpated by\r\ntheir merciless persecutors.]\r\n\r\nOther citizens made similar proposals, but the King, being made\r\nacquainted with them by a deputation from the Commune, while expressing\r\nhis gratitude for all the offers, accepted only that of Malesherbes.\r\n\r\n[The Citoyenne Olympia Degonges, calling herself a free and loyal\r\nRepublican without spot or blame, and declaring that the cold and selfish\r\ncruelty of Target had inflamed her heroism and roused her sensibility,\r\nasked permission to assist M, de Malesherbes in defending the King.  The\r\nAssembly passed to the order of the day on this request.--BERTRAND DE\r\nMOLLEVILLE, “Annals,” edit.  1802, vol, viii., p. 254.]\r\n\r\nOn 14th December M. Tronchet was allowed to confer with the King, and\r\nlater in the same day M. de Malesherbes was admitted to the Tower.  “The\r\nKing ran up to this worthy old man, whom he clasped in his arms,” said\r\nClery, “and the former minister melted into tears at the sight of his\r\nmaster.”\r\n\r\n[According to M. de Hue, “The first time M. de Malesherbes entered the\r\nTemple, the King clasped him in his arms and said, ‘Ah, is it you, my\r\nfriend?  You fear not to endanger your own life to save mine; but all will\r\nbe useless.  They will bring me to the scaffold. No matter; I shall gain\r\nmy cause if I leave an unspotted memory behind me.’”]\r\n\r\nAnother deputation brought the King the Act of Accusation and the\r\ndocuments relating to it, numbering more than a hundred, and taking from\r\nfour o’clock till midnight to read.  During this long process the King had\r\nrefreshments served to the deputies, taking nothing himself till they had\r\nleft, but considerately reproving Clery for not having supped.  From the\r\n14th to the 26th December the King saw his counsel and their colleague M.\r\nde Size every day.  At this time a means of communication between the\r\nroyal family and the King was devised: a man named Turgi, who had been in\r\nthe royal kitchen, and who contrived to obtain employment in the Temple,\r\nwhen conveying the meals of the royal family to their apartments, or\r\narticles he had purchased for them, managed to give Madame Elisabeth news\r\nof the King.  Next day, the Princess, when Turgi was removing the dinner,\r\nslipped into his hand a bit of paper on which she had pricked with a pin a\r\nrequest for a word from her brother’s own hand. Turgi gave this paper to\r\nClery, who conveyed it to the King the same evening; and he, being allowed\r\nwriting materials while preparing his defence, wrote Madame Elisabeth a\r\nshort note.  An answer was conveyed in a ball of cotton, which Turgi threw\r\nunder Clery’s bed while passing the door of his room.  Letters were also\r\npassed between the Princess’s room and that of Clery, who lodged beneath\r\nher, by means of a string let down and drawn up at night.  This\r\ncommunication with his family was a great comfort to the King, who,\r\nnevertheless, constantly cautioned his faithful servant.  “Take care,” he\r\nwould say kindly, “you expose yourself too much.”\r\n\r\n[The King’s natural benevolence was constantly shown while in the Temple.\r\nHis own dreadful position never prevented him from sympathy with the\r\nsmaller troubles of others.  A servant in the Temple named Marchand, the\r\nfather of a family, was robbed of two hundred francs,--his wages for two\r\nmonths.  The King observed his distress, asked its cause, and gave Clery\r\nthe amount to be handed to Marchand, with a caution not to speak of it to\r\nany one, and, above all, not to thank the King, lest it should injure him\r\nwith his employers.]\r\n\r\nDuring his separation from his family the King refused to go into the\r\ngarden.  When it was proposed to him he said, “I cannot make up my mind to\r\ngo out alone; the walk was agreeable to me only when I shared it with my\r\nfamily.”  But he did not allow himself to dwell on painful reflections.\r\nHe talked freely to the municipals on guard, and surprised them by his\r\nvaried and practical knowledge of their trades, and his interest in their\r\ndomestic affairs.  On the 19th December the King’s breakfast was served as\r\nusual; but, being a fast-day, he refused to take anything.  At dinner-time\r\nthe King said to Clery, “Fourteen years ago you were up earlier than you\r\nwere to-day; it is the day my daughter was born--today, her birthday,” he\r\nrepeated, with tears, “and to be prevented from seeing her!”  Madame\r\nRoyale had wished for a calendar; the King ordered Clery to buy her the\r\n“Almanac of the Republic,” which had replaced the “Court Almanac,” and ran\r\nthrough it, marking with a pencil many names.\r\n\r\n“On Christmas Day,” Says Clery, “the King wrote his will.”\r\n\r\n[Madame Royale says: “On the 26th December, St. Stephen’s Day, my father\r\nmade his will, because he expected to be assassinated that day on his way\r\nto the bar of the Convention.  He went thither, nevertheless, with his\r\nusual calmness.”--“Royal Memoirs,” p. 196.]\r\n\r\nOn the 26th December, 1792, the King appeared a second time before the\r\nConvention.  M. de Seze, labouring night and day, had completed his\r\ndefence.  The King insisted on excluding from it all that was too\r\nrhetorical, and confining it to the mere discussion of essential points.\r\n\r\n[When the pathetic peroration of M, de Seze was read to the King, the\r\nevening before it was delivered to the Assembly, “I have to request of\r\nyou,” he said, “to make a painful sacrifice; strike out of your pleading\r\nthe peroration.  It is enough for me to appear before such judges, and\r\nshow my entire innocence; I will not move their feelings.”--LACRETELLE.]\r\n\r\nAt half-past nine in the morning the whole armed force was in motion to\r\nconduct him from the Temple to the Feuillans, with the same precautions\r\nand in the same order as had been observed on the former occasion. Riding\r\nin the carriage of the Mayor, he conversed, on the way, with the same\r\ncomposure as usual, and talked of Seneca, of Livy, of the hospitals.\r\nArrived at the Feuillans, he showed great anxiety for his defenders; he\r\nseated himself beside them in the Assembly, surveyed with great composure\r\nthe benches where his accusers and his judges sat, seemed to examine their\r\nfaces with the view of discovering the impression produced by the pleading\r\nof M. de Seze, and more than once conversed smilingly with Tronchet and\r\nMalesherbes.  The Assembly received his defence in sullen silence, but\r\nwithout any tokens of disapprobation.\r\n\r\nBeing afterwards conducted to an adjoining room with his counsel, the King\r\nshowed great anxiety about M. de Seze, who seemed fatigued by the long\r\ndefence.  While riding back to the Temple he conversed with his companions\r\nwith the same serenity as he had shown on leaving it.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the King left the hall of the Convention than a violent\r\ntumult arose there.  Some were for opening the discussion.  Others,\r\ncomplaining of the delays which postponed the decision of this process,\r\ndemanded the vote immediately, remarking that in every court, after the\r\naccused had been heard, the judges proceed to give their opinion.\r\nLanjuinais had from the commencement of the proceedings felt an\r\nindignation which his impetuous disposition no longer suffered him to\r\nrepress.  He darted to the tribune, and, amidst the cries excited by his\r\npresence, demanded the annulling of the proceedings altogether. He\r\nexclaimed that the days of ferocious men were gone by, that the Assembly\r\nought not to be so dishonoured as to be made to sit in judgment on Louis\r\nXVI., that no authority in France had that right, and the Assembly in\r\nparticular had no claim to it; that if it resolved to act as a political\r\nbody, it could do no more than take measures of safety against the\r\nci-devant King; but that if it was acting as a court of justice it was\r\noverstepping all principles, for it was subjecting the vanquished to be\r\ntried by the conquerors, since most of the present members had declared\r\nthemselves the conspirators of the 10th of August. At the word\r\n“conspirators” a tremendous uproar arose on all aides.  Cries of\r\n“Order!”--“To the Abbaye!”--“Down with the Tribune!” were heard.\r\nLanjuinais strove in vain to justify the word “conspirators,” saying that\r\nhe meant it to be taken in a favourable sense, and that the 10th of August\r\nwas a glorious conspiracy.  He concluded by declaring that he would rather\r\ndie a thousand deaths than condemn, contrary to all laws, even the most\r\nexecrable of tyrants.\r\n\r\nA great number of speakers followed, and the confusion continually\r\nincreased.  The members, determined not to hear any more, mingled\r\ntogether, formed groups, abused and threatened one another.  After a\r\ntempest of an hour’s duration, tranquillity was at last restored; and the\r\nAssembly, adopting the opinion of those who demanded the discussion on the\r\ntrial of Louis XVI., declared that it was opened, and that it should be\r\ncontinued, to the exclusion of all other business, till sentence should be\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nThe discussion was accordingly resumed on the 27th, and there was a\r\nconstant succession of speakers from the 28th to the 31st.  Vergniaud at\r\nlength ascended the tribune for the first time, and an extraordinary\r\neagerness was manifested to hear the Girondists express their sentiments\r\nby the lips of their greatest orator.\r\n\r\nThe speech of Vergniaud produced a deep impression on all his hearers.\r\nRobespierre was thunderstruck by his earnest and, persuasive eloquence.\r\nVergniaud, however, had but shaken, not convinced, the Assembly, which\r\nwavered between the two parties.  Several members were successively heard,\r\nfor and against the appeal to the people.  Brissot, Gensonne, Petion,\r\nsupported it in their turn.  One speaker at length had a decisive\r\ninfluence on the question.  Barere, by his suppleness, and his cold and\r\nevasive eloquence, was the model and oracle of the centre.  He spoke at\r\ngreat length on the trial, reviewed it in all its bearings--of facts, of\r\nlaws, and of policy--and furnished all those weak minds, who only wanted\r\nspecious reasons for yielding, with motives for the condemnation of the\r\nKing.  From that moment the unfortunate King was condemned.  The\r\ndiscussion lasted till the 7th, and nobody would listen any longer to the\r\ncontinual repetition of the same facts and arguments.  It was therefore\r\ndeclared to be closed without opposition, but the proposal of a fresh\r\nadjournment excited a commotion among the most violent, and ended in a\r\ndecree which fixed the 14th of January for putting the questions to the\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nMeantime the King did not allow the torturing suspense to disturb his\r\noutward composure, or lessen his kindness to those around him.  On the\r\nmorning after his second appearance at the bar of the Convention, the\r\ncommissary Vincent, who had undertaken secretly to convey to the Queen a\r\ncopy of the King’s printed defence, asked for something which had belonged\r\nto him, to treasure as a relic; the King took off his neck handkerchief\r\nand gave it him; his gloves he bestowed on another municipal, who had made\r\nthe same request.  “On January 1st,” says Clery, “I approached the King’s\r\nbed and asked permission to offer him my warmest prayers for the end of\r\nhis misfortunes.  ‘I accept your good wishes with affection,’ he replied,\r\nextending his hand to me.  As soon as he had risen, he requested a\r\nmunicipal to go and inquire for his family, and present them his good\r\nwishes for the new year.  The officers were moved by the tone in which\r\nthese words, so heartrending considering the position of the King, were\r\npronounced .  .  .  .  The correspondence between their Majesties went on\r\nconstantly.  The King being informed that Madame Royale was ill, was very\r\nuneasy for some days.  The Queen, after begging earnestly, obtained\r\npermission for M. Brunnier, the medical attendant of the royal children,\r\nto come to the Temple.  This seemed to quiet him.”\r\n\r\nThe nearer the moment which was to decide the King’s fate approached, the\r\ngreater became the agitation in, Paris.  “A report was circulated that the\r\natrocities of September were to be repeated there, and the prisoners and\r\ntheir relatives beset the deputies with supplications that they would\r\nsnatch them from destruction.  The Jacobins, on their part, alleged that\r\nconspiracies were hatching in all quarters to save Louis XVI.  from\r\npunishment, and to restore royalty.  Their anger, excited by delays and\r\nobstacles, assumed a more threatening aspect; and the two parties thus\r\nalarmed one another by supposing that each harboured sinister designs.”\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of January the Convention called for the order of the day,\r\nbeing the final judgment of Louis XVI.\r\n\r\n“The sitting of the Convention which concluded the trial,” says Hazlitt,\r\n“lasted seventy-two hours.  It might naturally be supposed that silence,\r\nrestraint, a sort of religious awe, would have pervaded the scene.  On the\r\ncontrary, everything bore the marks of gaiety, dissipation, and the most\r\ngrotesque confusion.  The farther end of the hall was converted into\r\nboxes, where ladies, in a studied deshabille, swallowed ices, oranges,\r\nliqueurs, and received the salutations of the members who went and came,\r\nas on ordinary occasions.  Here the doorkeepers on the Mountain side\r\nopened and shut the boxes reserved for the mistresses of the Duc\r\nd’Orleans; and there, though every sound of approbation or disapprobation\r\nwas strictly forbidden, you heard the long and indignant ‘Ha, ha’s!’ of\r\nthe mother-duchess, the patroness of the bands of female Jacobins,\r\nwhenever her ears were not loudly greeted with the welcome sounds of\r\ndeath.  The upper gallery, reserved for the people, was during the whole\r\ntrial constantly full of strangers of every description, drinking wine as\r\nin a tavern.\r\n\r\n“Bets were made as to the issue of the trial in all the neighbouring\r\ncoffee-houses.  Ennui, impatience, disgust sat on almost every\r\ncountenance.  The figures passing and repassing, rendered more ghastly by\r\nthe pallid lights, and who in a slow, sepulchral voice pronounced only the\r\nword--Death; others calculating if they should have time to go to dinner\r\nbefore they gave their verdict; women pricking cards with pins in order to\r\ncount the votes; some of the deputies fallen asleep, and only waking up to\r\ngive their sentence,--all this had the appearance rather of a hideous\r\ndream than of a reality.”\r\n\r\nThe Duc d’Orleans, when called on to give his vote for the death of his\r\nKing and relation, walked with a faltering step, and a face paler than\r\ndeath itself, to the appointed place, and there read these words:\r\n“Exclusively governed by my duty, and convinced that all those who have\r\nresisted the sovereignty of the people deserve death, my vote is for\r\ndeath!”  Important as the accession of the first Prince of the blood was\r\nto the Terrorist faction, his conduct in this instance was too obviously\r\nselfish and atrocious not to excite a general feeling of indignation; the\r\nagitation of the Assembly became extreme; it seemed as if by this single\r\nvote the fate of the monarch was irrevocably sealed.\r\n\r\nThe President having examined the register, the result of the scrutiny was\r\nproclaimed as follows:\r\n\r\n     Against an appeal to the people........... 480\r\n     For an appeal to the people............... 283\r\n\r\n     Majority for final judgment............... 197\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President having announced that he was about to declare the result of\r\nthe scrutiny, a profound silence ensued, and he then gave in the following\r\ndeclaration: that, out of 719 votes, 366 were for DEATH, 319 were for\r\nimprisonment during the war, two for perpetual imprisonment, eight for a\r\nsuspension of the execution of the sentence of death until after the\r\nexpulsion of the family of the Bourbons, twenty-three were for not putting\r\nhim to death until the French territory was invaded by any foreign power,\r\nand one was for a sentence of death, but with power of commutation of the\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nAfter this enumeration the President took off his hat, and, lowering his\r\nvoice, said: “In consequence of this expression of opinion I declare that\r\nthe punishment pronounced by the National Convention against Louis Capet\r\nis DEATH!”\r\n\r\nPrevious to the passing of the sentence the President announced on the\r\npart of the Foreign Minister the receipt of a letter from the Spanish\r\nMinister relative to that sentence.  The Convention, however, refused to\r\nhear it.  [It will be remembered that a similar remonstrance was forwarded\r\nby the English Government.]\r\n\r\nM. de Malesherbes, according to his promise to the King, went to the\r\nTemple at nine o’clock on the morning of the 17th.\r\n\r\n[Louis was fully prepared for his fate.  During the calling of the votes\r\nhe asked M. de Malesherbes, “Have you not met near the Temple the White\r\nLady?”--“What do you mean?” replied he.  “Do you not know,” resumed the\r\nKing with a smile, “that when a prince of our house is about to die, a\r\nfemale dressed in white is seen wandering about the palace?  My friends,”\r\n added he to his defenders, “I am about to depart before you for the land\r\nof the just, but there, at least, we shall be reunited.”  In fact, his\r\nMajesty’s only apprehension seemed to be for his family.--ALISON.]\r\n\r\n“All is lost,” he said to Clery.  “The King is condemned.”  The King, who\r\nsaw him arrive, rose to receive him.\r\n\r\n[When M. de Malesherbes went to the Temple to announce the result of the\r\nvote, he found Louis with his forehead resting on his hands, and absorbed\r\nin a deep reverie.  Without inquiring concerning his fate, he said: “For\r\ntwo hours I have been considering whether, during my whole reign, I have\r\nvoluntarily given any cause of complaint to my subjects; and with perfect\r\nsincerity I declare that I deserve no reproach at their hands, and that I\r\nhave never formed a wish but for their happiness.”  LACRETELLE.]\r\n\r\nM. de Malesherbes, choked by sobs, threw himself at his feet.  The King\r\nraised him up and affectionately embraced him.  When he could control his\r\nvoice, De Malesherbes informed the King of the decree sentencing him to\r\ndeath; he made no movement of surprise or emotion, but seemed only\r\naffected by the distress of his advocate, whom he tried to comfort.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of January, at two in the afternoon, Louis XVI. was awaiting\r\nhis advocates, when he heard the approach of a numerous party.  He stopped\r\nwith dignity at the door of his apartment, apparently unmoved: Garat then\r\ntold him sorrowfully that he was commissioned to communicate to him the\r\ndecrees of the Convention.  Grouvelle, secretary of the Executive Council,\r\nread them to him.  The first declared Louis XVI. guilty of treason against\r\nthe general safety of the State; the second condemned him to death; the\r\nthird rejected any appeal to the people; and the fourth and last ordered\r\nhis execution in twenty-four hours.  Louis, looking calmly round, took the\r\npaper from Grouvelle, and read Garat a letter, in which he demanded from\r\nthe Convention three days to prepare for death, a confessor to assist him\r\nin his last moments, liberty to see his family, and permission for them to\r\nleave France.  Garat took the letter, promising to submit it immediately\r\nto the Convention.\r\n\r\nLouis XVI. then went back into his room with great composure, ordered his\r\ndinner, and ate as usual.  There were no knives on the table, and his\r\nattendants refused to let him have any.  “Do they think me so cowardly,”\r\n he exclaimed, “as to lay violent hands on myself?  I am innocent, and I am\r\nnot afraid to die.”\r\n\r\nThe Convention refused the delay, but granted some other demands which he\r\nhad made.  Garat sent for Edgeworth de Firmont, the ecclesiastic whom\r\nLouis XVI. had chosen, and took him in his own carriage to the Temple. M.\r\nEdgeworth, on being ushered into the presence of the King, would have\r\nthrown himself at his feet, but Louis instantly raised him, and both shed\r\ntears of emotion.  He then, with eager curiosity, asked various questions\r\nconcerning the clergy of France, several bishops, and particularly the\r\nArchbishop of Paris, requesting him to assure the latter that he died\r\nfaithfully attached to his communion.--The clock having struck eight, he\r\nrose, begged M. Edgeworth to wait, and retired with emotion, saying that\r\nhe was going to see his family.  The municipal officers, unwilling to lose\r\nsight of the King, even while with his family, had decided that he should\r\nsee them in the dining-room, which had a glass door, through which they\r\ncould watch all his motions without hearing what he said.  At half-past\r\neight the door opened.  The Queen, holding the Dauphin by the hand, Madame\r\nElisabeth, and Madame Royale rushed sobbing into the arms of Louis XVI.\r\nThe door was closed, and the municipal officers, Clery, and M. Edgeworth\r\nplaced themselves behind it.  During the first moments, it was but a scene\r\nof confusion and despair.  Cries and lamentations prevented those who were\r\non the watch from distinguishing anything.  At length the conversation\r\nbecame more calm, and the Princesses, still holding the King clasped in\r\ntheir arms, spoke with him in a low tone.  “He related his trial to my\r\nmother,” says Madame Royale, “apologising for the wretches who had\r\ncondemned him.  He told her that he would not consent to any attempt to\r\nsave him, which might excite disturbance in the country. He then gave my\r\nbrother some religious advice, and desired him, above all, to forgive\r\nthose who caused his death; and he gave us his blessing. My mother was\r\nvery desirous that the whole family should pass the night with my father,\r\nbut he opposed this, observing to her that he much needed some hours of\r\nrepose and quiet.”  After a long conversation, interrupted by silence and\r\ngrief, the King put an end to the painful meeting, agreeing to see his\r\nfamily again at eight the next morning.  “Do you promise that you will?”\r\n earnestly inquired the Princesses.  “Yes, yes,” sorrowfully replied the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n[“But when we were gone,” says his daughter, “he requested that we might\r\nnot be permitted to return, as our presence afflicted him too much.”]\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Queen held him by one arm, Madame Elisabeth by the\r\nother, while Madame Royale clasped him round the waist, and the Dauphin\r\nstood before him, with one hand in that of his mother.  At the moment of\r\nretiring Madame Royale fainted; she was carried away, and the King\r\nreturned to M. Edgeworth deeply depressed by this painful interview. The\r\nKing retired to rest about midnight; M. Edgeworth threw himself upon a\r\nbed, and Clery took his place near the pillow of his master.\r\n\r\nNext morning, the 21st of January, at five, the King awoke, called Clery,\r\nand dressed with great calmness.  He congratulated himself on having\r\nrecovered his strength by sleep.  Clery kindled a fire, and moved a chest\r\nof drawers, out of which he formed an altar.  M. Edgeworth put on his\r\npontifical robes, and began to celebrate mass.  Clery waited on him, and\r\nthe King listened, kneeling with the greatest devotion.  He then received\r\nthe communion from the hands of M. Edgeworth, and after mass rose with new\r\nvigour, and awaited with composure the moment for going to the scaffold.\r\nHe asked for scissors that Clery might cut his hair; but the Commune\r\nrefused to trust him with a pair.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the drums were beating in the capital.  All who belonged to\r\nthe armed sections repaired to their company with complete submission. It\r\nwas reported that four or five hundred devoted men, were to make a dash\r\nupon the carriage, and rescue the King.  The Convention, the Commune, the\r\nExecutive Council, and the Jacobins were sitting.  At eight in the\r\nmorning, Santerre, with a deputation from the Commune, the department, and\r\nthe criminal tribunal, repaired to the Temple.  Louis XVI., on hearing\r\nthem arrive, rose and prepared to depart.  He desired Clery to transmit\r\nhis last farewell to his wife, his sister, and his children; he gave him a\r\nsealed packet, hair, and various trinkets, with directions to deliver\r\nthese articles to them.\r\n\r\n[In the course of the morning the King said to me: “You will give this\r\nseal to my son and this ring to the Queen, and assure her that it is with\r\npain I part with it.  This little packet contains the hair of all my\r\nfamily; you will give her that, too.  Tell the Queen, my dear sister, and\r\nmy children, that, although I promised to see them again this morning, I\r\nhave resolved to spare them the pang of so cruel a separation.  Tell them\r\nhow much it costs me to go away without receiving their embraces once\r\nmore!”  He wiped away some tears, and then added, in the most mournful\r\naccents, “I charge you to bear them my last farewell.”--CLERY.]\r\n\r\nHe then clasped his hand and thanked him for his services.  After this he\r\naddressed himself to one of the municipal officers, requesting him to\r\ntransmit his last will to the Commune.  This officer, who had formerly\r\nbeen a priest, and was named Jacques Roux, brutally replied that his\r\nbusiness was to conduct him to execution, and not to perform his\r\ncommissions.  Another person took charge of it, and Louis, turning towards\r\nthe party, gave with firmness the signal for starting.\r\n\r\nOfficers of gendarmerie were placed on the front seat of the carriage. The\r\nKing and M. Edgeworth occupied the back.  During the ride, which was\r\nrather long, the King read in M. Edgeworth’s breviary the prayers for\r\npersons at the point of death; the two gendarmes were astonished at his\r\npiety and tranquil resignation.  The vehicle advanced slowly, and amidst\r\nuniversal silence.  At the Place de la Revolution an extensive space had\r\nbeen left vacant about the scaffold.  Around this space were planted\r\ncannon; the most violent of the Federalists were stationed about the\r\nscaffold; and the vile rabble, always ready to insult genius, virtue, and\r\nmisfortune, when a signal is given it to do so, crowded behind the ranks\r\nof the Federalists, and alone manifested some outward tokens of\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAt ten minutes past ten the carriage stopped.  Louis XVI., rising briskly,\r\nstepped out into the Place.  Three executioners came up; he refused their\r\nassistance, and took off his clothes himself.  But, perceiving that they\r\nwere going to bind his hands, he made a movement of indignation, and\r\nseemed ready to resist.  M. Edgeworth gave him a last look, and said,\r\n“Suffer this outrage, as a last resemblance to that God who is about to be\r\nyour reward.”  At these words the King suffered himself to be bound and\r\nconducted to the scaffold.  All at once Louis hurriedly advanced to\r\naddress the people.  “Frenchmen,” said he, in a firm voice, “I die\r\ninnocent of the crimes which are imputed to me; I forgive the authors of\r\nmy death, and I pray that my blood may not fall upon France.”  He would\r\nhave continued, but the drums were instantly ordered to beat: their\r\nrolling drowned his voice; the executioners laid hold of him, and M.\r\nEdgeworth took his leave in these memorable words: “Son of Saint Louis,\r\nascend to heaven!”  As soon as the blood flowed, furious wretches dipped\r\ntheir pikes and handkerchiefs in it, then dispersed throughout Paris,\r\nshouting “Vive la Republique!  Vive la Nation!”  and even went to the\r\ngates of the Temple to display brutal and factious joy.\r\n\r\n[The body of Louis was, immediately after the execution, removed to the\r\nancient cemetery of the Madeleine.  Large quantities of quicklime were\r\nthrown into the grave, which occasioned so rapid a decomposition that,\r\nwhen his remains were sought for in 1816, it was with difficulty any part\r\ncould be recovered.  Over the spot where he was interred Napoleon\r\ncommenced the splendid Temple of Glory, after the battle of Jena; and the\r\nsuperb edifice was completed by the Bourbons, and now forms the Church of\r\nthe Madeleine, the most beautiful structure in Paris.  Louis was executed\r\non the same ground where the Queen, Madame Elisabeth, and so many other\r\nnoble victims of the Revolution perished; where Robespierre and Danton\r\nafterwards suffered; and where the Emperor Alexander and the allied\r\nsovereigns took their station, when their victorious troops entered Paris\r\nin 1814!  The history of modern Europe has not a scene fraught with\r\nequally interesting recollections to exhibit.  It is now marked by the\r\ncolossal obelisk of blood-red granite which was brought from Thebes, in\r\nUpper Egypt, in 1833, by the French Government.--ALLISON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Royal Prisoners.--Separation of the Dauphin from His Family.\r\n--Removal of the Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the King’s execution, according to the narrative of\r\nMadame Royale, his family rose at six: “The night before, my mother had\r\nscarcely strength enough to put my brother to bed; She threw herself,\r\ndressed as she was, on her own bed, where we heard her shivering with cold\r\nand grief all night long.  At a quarter-past six the door opened; we\r\nbelieved that we were sent for to the King, but it was only the officers\r\nlooking for a prayer-book for him.  We did not, however, abandon the hope\r\nof seeing him, till shouts of joy from the infuriated populace told us\r\nthat all was over.  In the afternoon my mother asked to see Clery, who\r\nprobably had some message for her; we hoped that seeing him would occasion\r\na burst of grief which might relieve the state of silent and choking agony\r\nin which we saw her.”  The request was refused, and the officers who\r\nbrought the refusal said Clery was in “a frightful state of despair” at\r\nnot being allowed to see the royal family; shortly afterwards he was\r\ndismissed from the Temple.\r\n\r\n“We had now a little more freedom,” continues the Princess; “our guards\r\neven believed that we were about to be sent out of France; but nothing\r\ncould calm my mother’s agony; no hope could touch her heart, and life or\r\ndeath became indifferent to her.  Fortunately my own affliction increased\r\nmy illness so seriously that it distracted her thoughts .  .  .  . My\r\nmother would go no more to the garden, because she must have passed the\r\ndoor of what had been my father’s room, and that she could not bear. But\r\nfearing lest want of air should prove injurious to my brother and me,\r\nabout the end of February she asked permission to walk on the leads of the\r\nTower, and it was granted.”\r\n\r\nThe Council of the Commune, becoming aware of the interest which these sad\r\npromenades excited, and the sympathy with which they were observed from\r\nthe neighbouring houses, ordered that the spaces between the battlements\r\nshould be filled up with shutters, which intercepted the view.  But while\r\nthe rules for the Queen’s captivity were again made more strict, some of\r\nthe municipal commissioners tried slightly to alleviate it, and by means\r\nof M. de Hue, who was at liberty in Paris, and the faithful Turgi, who\r\nremained in the Tower, some communications passed between the royal family\r\nand their friends.  The wife of Tison, who waited on the Queen, suspected\r\nand finally denounced these more lenient guardians,--[Toulan, Lepitre,\r\nVincent, Bruno, and others.]--who were executed, the royal prisoners being\r\nsubjected to a close examination.\r\n\r\n“On the 20th of April,” says Madame Royale, “my mother and I had just gone\r\nto bed when Hebert arrived with several municipals.  We got up hastily,\r\nand these men read us a decree of the Commune directing that we should be\r\nsearched.  My poor brother was asleep; they tore him from his bed under\r\nthe pretext of examining it.  My mother took him up, shivering with cold.\r\nAll they took was a shopkeeper’s card which my mother had happened to\r\nkeep, a stick of sealing-wax from my aunt, and from me ‘une sacre coeur de\r\nJesus’ and a prayer for the welfare of France.  The search lasted from\r\nhalf-past ten at night till four o’clock in the morning.”\r\n\r\nThe next visit of the officials was to Madame Elisabeth alone; they found\r\nin her room a hat which the King had worn during his imprisonment, and\r\nwhich she had begged him to give her as a souvenir.  They took it from her\r\nin spite of her entreaties.  “It was suspicious,” said the cruel and\r\ncontemptible tyrants.\r\n\r\nThe Dauphin became ill with fever, and it was long before his mother, who\r\nwatched by him night and day, could obtain medicine or advice for him.\r\nWhen Thierry was at last allowed to see him his treatment relieved the\r\nmost violent symptoms, but, says Madame Royale, “his health was never\r\nreestablished.  Want of air and exercise did him great mischief, as well\r\nas the kind of life which this poor child led, who at eight years of age\r\npassed his days amidst the tears of his friends, and in constant anxiety\r\nand agony.”\r\n\r\nWhile the Dauphin’s health was causing his family such alarm, they were\r\ndeprived of the services of Tison’s wife, who became ill, and finally\r\ninsane, and was removed to the Hotel Dieu, where her ravings were reported\r\nto the Assembly and made the ground of accusations against the royal\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n[This woman, troubled by remorse, lost her reason, threw herself at the\r\nfeet of the Queen, implored her pardon, and disturbed the Temple for many\r\ndays with the sight and the noise of her madness.  The Princesses,\r\nforgetting the denunciations of this unfortunate being, in consideration\r\nof her repentance and insanity, watched over her by turns, and deprived\r\nthemselves of their own food to relieve her.--LAMARTINE, “History of the\r\nGirondists,” vol. iii., p.140.]\r\n\r\nNo woman took her place, and the Princesses themselves made their beds,\r\nswept their rooms, and waited upon the Queen.\r\n\r\nFar worse punishments than menial work were prepared for them.  On 3d July\r\na decree of the Convention ordered that the Dauphin should be separated\r\nfrom his family and “placed in the most secure apartment of the Tower.”\r\n As soon as he heard this decree pronounced, says his sister, “he threw\r\nhimself into my mother’s arms, and with violent cries entreated not to be\r\nparted from her.  My mother would not let her son go, and she actually\r\ndefended against the efforts of the officers the bed in which she had\r\nplaced him.  The men threatened to call up the guard and use violence.  My\r\nmother exclaimed that they had better kill her than tear her child from\r\nher.  At last they threatened our lives, and my mother’s maternal\r\ntenderness forced her to the sacrifice.  My aunt and I dressed the child,\r\nfor my poor mother had no longer strength for anything. Nevertheless, when\r\nhe was dressed, she took him up in her arms and delivered him herself to\r\nthe officers, bathing him with her tears, foreseeing that she was never to\r\nbehold him again.  The poor little fellow embraced us all tenderly, and\r\nwas carried away in a flood of tears.  My mother’s horror was extreme when\r\nshe heard that Simon, a shoemaker by trade, whom she had seen as a\r\nmunicipal officer in the Temple, was the person to whom her child was\r\nconfided .  .  .  .  The officers now no longer remained in my mother’s\r\napartment; they only came three times a day to bring our meals and examine\r\nthe bolts and bars of our windows; we were locked up together night and\r\nday.  We often went up to the Tower, because my brother went, too, from\r\nthe other side.  The only pleasure my mother enjoyed was seeing him\r\nthrough a crevice as he passed at a distance.  She would watch for hours\r\ntogether to see him as he passed.  It was her only hope, her only\r\nthought.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen was soon deprived even of this melancholy consolation.  On 1st\r\nAugust, 1793, it was resolved that she should be tried.  Robespierre\r\nopposed the measure, but Barere roused into action that deep-rooted hatred\r\nof the Queen which not even the sacrifice of her life availed to\r\neradicate.  “Why do the enemies of the Republic still hope for success?”\r\n he asked.  “Is it because we have too long forgotten the crimes of the\r\nAustrian?  The children of Louis the Conspirator are hostages for the\r\nRepublic .  .  .but behind them lurks a woman who has been the cause of\r\nall the disasters of France.”\r\n\r\nAt two o’clock on the morning of the following day, the municipal officers\r\n“awoke us,” says Madame Royale, “to read to my mother the decree of the\r\nConvention, which ordered her removal to the Conciergerie,\r\n\r\n[The Conciergerie was originally, as its name implies, the porter’s lodge\r\nof the ancient Palace of Justice, and became in time a prison, from the\r\ncustom of confining there persons who had committed trifling offences\r\nabout the Court.]\r\n\r\npreparatory to her trial.  She heard it without visible emotion, and\r\nwithout speaking a single word.  My aunt and I immediately asked to be\r\nallowed to accompany my mother, but this favour was refused us.  All the\r\ntime my mother was making up a bundle of clothes to take with her, these\r\nofficers never left her.  She was even obliged to dress herself before\r\nthem, and they asked for her pockets, taking away the trifles they\r\ncontained.  She embraced me, charging me to keep up my spirits and my\r\ncourage, to take tender care of my aunt, and obey her as a second mother.\r\nShe then threw herself into my aunt’s arms, and recommended her children\r\nto her care; my aunt replied to her in a whisper, and she was then hurried\r\naway.  In leaving the Temple she struck her head against the wicket, not\r\nhaving stooped low enough.\r\n\r\n[Mathieu, the gaoler, used to say, “I make Madame Veto and her sister and\r\ndaughter, proud though they are, salute me; for the door is so low they\r\ncannot pass without bowing.”]\r\n\r\nThe officers asked whether she had hurt herself.  ‘No,’ she replied,\r\n‘nothing can hurt me now.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Last Moments of Marie Antoinette.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already seen what changes had been made in the Temple.  Marie\r\nAntoinette had been separated from her sister, her daughter, and her Son,\r\nby virtue of a decree which ordered the trial and exile of the last\r\nmembers of the family of the Bourbons.  She had been removed to the\r\nConciergerie, and there, alone in a narrow prison, she was reduced to what\r\nwas strictly necessary, like the other prisoners.  The imprudence of a\r\ndevoted friend had rendered her situation still more irksome. Michonnis, a\r\nmember of the municipality, in whom she had excited a warm interest, was\r\ndesirous of introducing to her a person who, he said, wished to see her\r\nout of curiosity.  This man, a courageous emigrant, threw to her a\r\ncarnation, in which was enclosed a slip of very fine paper with these\r\nwords: “Your friends are ready,”--false hope, and equally dangerous for\r\nher who received it, and for him who gave it!  Michonnis and the emigrant\r\nwere detected and forthwith apprehended; and the vigilance exercised in\r\nregard to the unfortunate prisoner became from that day more rigorous than\r\never.\r\n\r\n[The Queen was lodged in a room called the council chamber, which was\r\nconsidered as the moat unwholesome apartment in the Conciergerie on\r\naccount of its dampness and the bad smells by which it was continually\r\naffected.  Under pretence of giving her a person to wait upon her they\r\nplaced near her a spy,--a man of a horrible countenance and hollow,\r\nsepulchral voice.  This wretch, whose name was Barassin, was a robber and\r\nmurderer by profession.  Such was the chosen attendant on the Queen of\r\nFrance!  A few days before her trial this wretch was removed and a\r\ngendarme placed in her chamber, who watched over her night and day, and\r\nfrom whom she was not separated, even when in bed, but by a ragged\r\ncurtain.  In this melancholy abode Marie Antoinette had no other dress\r\nthan an old black gown, stockings with holes, which she was forced to mend\r\nevery day; and she was entirely destitute of shoes.--DU  BROCA.]\r\n\r\nGendarmes were to mount guard incessantly at the door of her prison, and\r\nthey were expressly forbidden to answer anything that she might say to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThat wretch Hebert, the deputy of Chaumette, and editor of the disgusting\r\npaper Pere Duchesne, a writer of the party of which Vincent, Ronsin,\r\nVarlet, and Leclerc were the leaders--Hebert had made it his particular\r\nbusiness to torment the unfortunate remnant of the dethroned family. He\r\nasserted that the family of the tyrant ought not to be better treated than\r\nany sans-culotte family; and he had caused a resolution to be passed by\r\nwhich the sort of luxury in which the prisoners in the Temple were\r\nmaintained was to be suppressed.  They were no longer to be allowed either\r\npoultry or pastry; they were reduced to one sort of aliment for breakfast,\r\nand to soup or broth and a single dish for dinner, to two dishes for\r\nsupper, and half a bottle of wine apiece.  Tallow candles were to be\r\nfurnished instead of wag, pewter instead of silver plate, and delft ware\r\ninstead of porcelain.  The wood and water carriers alone were permitted to\r\nenter their room, and that only accompanied by two commissioners.  Their\r\nfood was to be introduced to them by means of a turning box.  The numerous\r\nestablishment was reduced to a cook and an assistant, two men-servants,\r\nand a woman-servant to attend to the linen.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this resolution was passed, Hebert had repaired to the Temple\r\nand inhumanly taken away from the unfortunate prisoners even the most\r\ntrifling articles to which they attached a high value.  Eighty Louis which\r\nMadame Elisabeth had in reserve, and which she had received from Madame de\r\nLamballe, were also taken away.  No one is more dangerous, more cruel,\r\nthan the man without acquirements, without education, clothed with a\r\nrecent authority.  If, above all, he possess a base nature, if, like\r\nHebert, who was check-taker at the door of a theatre, and embezzled money\r\nout of the receipts, he be destitute of natural morality, and if he leap\r\nall at once from the mud of his condition into power, he is as mean as he\r\nis atrocious.  Such was Hebert in his conduct at the Temple.  He did not\r\nconfine himself to the annoyances which we have mentioned.  He and some\r\nothers conceived the idea of separating the young Prince from his aunt and\r\nsister.  A shoemaker named Simon and his wife were the instructors to whom\r\nit was deemed right to consign him for the purpose of giving him a\r\nsans-cullotte education.  Simon and his wife were shut up in the Temple,\r\nand, becoming prisoners with the unfortunate child, were directed to bring\r\nhim up in their own way.  Their food was better than that of the\r\nPrincesses, and they shared the table of the municipal commissioners who\r\nwere on duty.  Simon was permitted to go down, accompanied by two\r\ncommissioners, to the court of the Temple, for the purpose of giving the\r\nDauphin a little exercise.\r\n\r\nHebert conceived the infamous idea of wringing from this boy revelations\r\nto criminate his unhappy mother.  Whether this wretch imputed to the child\r\nfalse revelations, or abused his, tender age and his condition to extort\r\nfrom him what admissions soever he pleased, he obtained a revolting\r\ndeposition; and as the youth of the Prince did not admit of his being\r\nbrought before the tribunal, Hebert appeared and detailed the infamous\r\nparticulars which he had himself either dictated or invented.\r\n\r\nIt was on the 14th of October that Marie Antoinette appeared before her\r\njudges.  Dragged before the sanguinary tribunal by inexorable\r\nrevolutionary vengeance, she appeared there without any chance of\r\nacquittal, for it was not to obtain her acquittal that the Jacobins had\r\nbrought her before it.  It was necessary, however, to make some charges.\r\nFouquier therefore collected the rumours current among the populace ever\r\nsince the arrival of the Princess in France, and, in the act of\r\naccusation, he charged her with having plundered the exchequer, first for\r\nher pleasures, and afterwards in order to transmit money to her brother,\r\nthe Emperor.  He insisted on the scenes of the 5th and 6th of October, and\r\non the dinners of the Life Guards, alleging that she had at that period\r\nframed a plot, which obliged the people to go to Versailles to frustrate\r\nit.  He afterwards accused her of having governed her husband, interfered\r\nin the choice of ministers, conducted the intrigues with the deputies\r\ngained by the Court, prepared the journey to Varennes, provoked the war,\r\nand transmitted to the enemy’s generals all our plans of campaign.  He\r\nfurther accused her of having prepared a new conspiracy on the 10th of\r\nAugust, of having on that day caused the people to be fired upon, having\r\ninduced her husband to defend himself by taxing him with cowardice;\r\nlastly, of having never ceased to plot and correspond with foreigners\r\nsince her captivity in the Temple, and of having there treated her young\r\nson as King.  We here observe how, on the terrible day of long-deferred\r\nvengeance, when subjects at length break forth and strike such of their\r\nprinces as have not deserved the blow, everything is distorted and\r\nconverted into crime.  We see how the profusion and fondness for pleasure,\r\nso natural to a young princess, how her attachment to her native country,\r\nher influence over her husband, her regrets, always more indiscreet in a\r\nwoman than a man, nay, even her bolder courage, appeared to their inflamed\r\nor malignant imaginations.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to produce witnesses.  Lecointre, deputy of Versailles,\r\nwho had seen what had passed on the 5th and 6th of October, Hebert, who\r\nhad frequently visited the Temple, various clerks in the ministerial\r\noffices, and several domestic servants of the old Court were summoned..\r\nAdmiral d’Estaing, formerly commandant of the guard of Versailles; Manuel,\r\nthe ex-procureur of the Commune; Latour-du-Pin, minister of war in 1789;\r\nthe venerable Bailly, who, it was said, had been, with La Fayette, an\r\naccomplice in the journey to Varennes; lastly, Valaze one of the\r\nGirondists destined to the scaffold, were taken from their prisons and\r\ncompelled to give evidence.\r\n\r\nNo precise fact was elicited.  Some had seen the Queen in high spirits\r\nwhen the Life Guards testified their attachment; others had seen her vexed\r\nand dejected while being conducted to Paris, or brought back from\r\nVarennes; these had been present at splendid festivities which must have\r\ncost enormous sums; those had heard it said in the ministerial offices\r\nthat the Queen was adverse to the sanction of the decrees.  An ancient\r\nwaiting-woman of the Queen had heard the Duc de Coigny say, in 1788, that\r\nthe Emperor had already received two hundred millions from France to make\r\nwar upon the Turks.\r\n\r\nThe cynical Hebert, being brought before the unfortunate Queen, dared at\r\nlength to prefer the charges wrung from the young Prince.  He said that\r\nCharles Capet had given Simon an account of the journey to Varennes, and\r\nmentioned La Fayette and Bailly as having cooperated in it.  He then added\r\nthat this boy was addicted to odious and very premature vices for his age;\r\nthat he had been surprised by Simon, who, on questioning him, learned that\r\nhe derived from his mother the vices in which he indulged. Hebert said\r\nthat it was no doubt the intention of Marie Antoinette, by weakening thus,\r\nearly the physical constitution of her son, to secure to herself the means\r\nof ruling him in case he should ever ascend the throne. The rumours which\r\nhad been whispered for twenty years by a malicious Court had given the\r\npeople a most unfavourable opinion of the morals of the Queen.  That\r\naudience, however, though wholly Jacobin, was disgusted at the accusations\r\nof Hebert.\r\n\r\n[Can there be a more infernal invention than that made against the. Queen\r\nby Hdbert,--namely, that she had had an improper intimacy with her own\r\nson?  He made use of this sublime idea of which he boasted in order to\r\nprejudice the women against the Queen, and to prevent her execution from\r\nexciting pity.  It had, however, no other effect than that of disgusting\r\nall parties.--PRUDHOMME.]\r\n\r\nHe nevertheless persisted in supporting them.\r\n\r\n[Hebert did not long survive her in whose sufferings he had taken such an\r\ninfamous part.  He was executed on 26th March, 1794.]\r\n\r\nThe unhappy mother made no reply.  Urged a new to explain herself, she\r\nsaid, with extraordinary emotion, “I thought that human nature would\r\nexcuse me from answering such an imputation, but I appeal from it to the\r\nheart of every mother here present.”  This noble and simple reply affected\r\nall who heard it.\r\n\r\nIn the depositions of the witnesses, however, all was not so bitter for\r\nMarie Antoinette.  The brave D’Estaing, whose enemy she had been, would\r\nnot say anything to inculpate her, and spoke only of the courage which she\r\nhad shown on the 5th and 6th of October, and of the noble resolution which\r\nshe had expressed, to die beside her husband rather than fly. Manuel, in\r\nspite of his enmity to the Court during the time of the Legislative\r\nAssembly, declared that he could not say anything against the accused.\r\nWhen the venerable Bailly was brought forward, who formerly so often\r\npredicted to the Court the calamities which its imprudence must produce,\r\nhe appeared painfully affected; and when he was asked if he knew the wife\r\nof Capet, “Yes,” said he, bowing respectfully, “I have known Madame.”  He\r\ndeclared that he knew nothing, and maintained that the declarations\r\nextorted from the young Prince relative to the journey to Varennes were\r\nfalse.  In recompense for his deposition he was assailed with outrageous\r\nreproaches, from which he might judge what fate would soon be awarded to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn all the evidence there appeared but two serious facts, attested by\r\nLatour-du-Pin and Valaze, who deposed to them because they could not help\r\nit.  Latour-du-Pin declared that Marie Antoinette had applied to him for\r\nan accurate statement of the armies while he was minister of war. Valaze,\r\nalways cold, but respectful towards misfortune, would not say anything to\r\ncriminate the accused; yet he could not help declaring that, as a member\r\nof the commission of twenty-four, being charged with his colleagues to\r\nexamine the papers found at the house of Septeuil, treasurer of the civil\r\nlist, he had seen bonds for various sums signed Antoinette, which was very\r\nnatural; but he added that he had also seen a letter in which the minister\r\nrequested the King to transmit to the Queen the copy of the plan of\r\ncampaign which he had in his hands.  The most unfavourable construction\r\nwas immediately put upon these two facts, the application for a statement\r\nof the armies, and the communication of the plan of campaign; and it was\r\nconcluded that they could not be wanted for any other purpose than to be\r\nsent to the enemy, for it was not supposed that a young princess should\r\nturn her attention, merely for her own satisfaction, to matters of\r\nadministration and military, plans.  After these depositions, several\r\nothers were received respecting the expenses of the Court, the influence\r\nof the Queen in public affairs, the scene of the 10th of August, and what\r\nhad passed in the Temple; and the most vague rumours and most trivial\r\ncircumstances were eagerly caught at as proofs.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette frequently repeated, with presence of mind and firmness,\r\nthat there was no precise fact against her; that, besides, though the\r\nwife of Louis XVI., she was not answerable for any of the acts of his\r\nreign.\r\n\r\n[At first the Queen, consulting only her own sense of dignity, had\r\nresolved on her trial to make no other reply to the questions of her\r\njudges than “Assassinate me as you have already assassinated my husband!”\r\n Afterwards, however, she determined to follow the example of the King,\r\nexert herself in her defence, and leave her judges without any excuse or\r\npretest for putting her to death.--WEBER’S “Memoirs of Marie Antoinette.”]\r\n\r\nFouquier nevertheless declared her to be sufficiently convicted;\r\nChaveau-Lagarde made unavailing efforts to defend her; and the\r\nunfortunate Queen was condemned to suffer the same fate as her husband.\r\n\r\nConveyed back to the Conciergerie, she there passed in tolerable composure\r\nthe night preceding her execution, and, on the morning of the following\r\nday, the 16th of October, she was conducted, amidst a great concourse of\r\nthe populace, to the fatal spot where, ten months before, Louis XVI.\r\nhad perished.\r\n\r\n[The Queen, after having written and prayed, slept soundly for some hours.\r\nOn her waking, Bault’s daughter dressed her and adjusted her hair with\r\nmore neatness than on other days.  Marie Antoinette wore a white gown, a\r\nwhite handkerchief covered her shoulders, a white cap her hair; a black\r\nribbon bound this cap round her temples....  The cries, the looks, the\r\nlaughter, the jests of the people overwhelmed her with humiliation; her\r\ncolour, changing continually from purple to paleness, betrayed her\r\nagitation....  On reaching the scaffold she inadvertently trod on the\r\nexecutioner’s foot.  “Pardon me,” she said, courteously.  She knelt for an\r\ninstant and uttered a half-audible prayer; then rising and glancing\r\ntowards the towers of the Temple, “Adieu, once again, my children,” she\r\nsaid; “I go to rejoin your father.”--LAMARTINE.]\r\n\r\nShe listened with calmness to the exhortations of the ecclesiastic who\r\naccompanied her, and cast an indifferent look at the people who had so\r\noften applauded her beauty and her grace, and who now as warmly\r\napplauded her execution.  On reaching the foot of the scaffold she\r\nperceived the Tuileries, and appeared to be moved; but she hastened to\r\nascend the fatal ladder, and gave herself up with courage to the\r\nexecutioner.\r\n\r\n[Sorrow had blanched the Queen’s once beautiful hair; but her features and\r\nair still commanded the admiration of all who beheld her; her cheeks, pale\r\nand emaciated, were occasionally tinged with a vivid colour at the mention\r\nof those she had lost.  When led out to execution, she was dressed in\r\nwhite; she had cut off her hair with her own hands.  Placed in a tumbrel,\r\nwith her arms tied behind her, she was taken by a circuitous route to the\r\nPlace de la Revolution, and she ascended the scaffold with a firm and\r\ndignified step, as if she had been about to take her place on a throne by\r\nthe side of her husband.-LACRETELLE.]\r\n\r\nThe infamous wretch exhibited her head to the people, as he was accustomed\r\nto do when he had sacrificed an illustrious victim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Last Separation.--Execution of Madame Elisabeth.\r\n--Death of the Dauphin.\r\n\r\nThe two Princesses left in the Temple were now almost inconsolable; they\r\nspent days and nights in tears, whose only alleviation was that they were\r\nshed together.  “The company of my aunt, whom I loved so tenderly,” said\r\nMadame Royale, “was a great comfort to me.  But alas!  all that I loved\r\nwas perishing around me, and I was soon to lose her also .  .  .  .  In\r\nthe beginning of September I had an illness caused solely by my anxiety\r\nabout my mother; I never heard a drum beat that I did not expect another\r\n3d of September.”--[when the head of the Princesse de Lamballe was carried\r\nto the Temple.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the month the rigour of their captivity was much\r\nincreased.  The Commune ordered that they should only have one room; that\r\nTison (who had done the heaviest of the household work for them, and since\r\nthe kindness they showed to his insane wife had occasionally given them\r\ntidings of the Dauphin) should be imprisoned in the turret; that they\r\nshould be supplied with only the barest necessaries; and that no one\r\nshould enter their room save to carry water and firewood.  Their quantity\r\nof firing was reduced, and they were not allowed candles.  They were also\r\nforbidden to go on the leads, and their large sheets were taken away,\r\n“lest--notwithstanding the gratings!--they should escape from the\r\nwindows.”\r\n\r\nOn 8th October, 1793, Madame Royale was ordered to go downstairs, that she\r\nmight be interrogated by some municipal officers.  “My aunt, who was\r\ngreatly affected, would have followed, but they stopped her.  She asked\r\nwhether I should be permitted to come up again; Chaumette assured her that\r\nI should.  ‘You may trust,’ said he, ‘the word of an honest republican.\r\nShe shall return.’  I soon found myself in my brother’s room, whom I\r\nembraced tenderly; but we were torn asunder, and I was obliged to go into\r\nanother room.--[This was the last time the brother and sister met] .  .  .\r\nChaumette then questioned me about a thousand shocking things of which\r\nthey accused my mother and aunt; I was so indignant at hearing such\r\nhorrors that, terrified as I was, I could not help exclaiming that they\r\nwere infamous falsehoods.\r\n\r\n“But in spite of my tears they still pressed their questions.  There were\r\nsome things which I did not comprehend, but of which I understood enough\r\nto make me weep with indignation and horror .  .  .  .  They then asked me\r\nabout Varennes, and other things.  I answered as well as I could without\r\nimplicating anybody.  I had always heard my parents say that it were\r\nbetter to die than to implicate anybody.”  When the examination was over\r\nthe Princess begged to be allowed to join her mother, but Chaumette said\r\nhe could not obtain permission for her to do so.  She was then cautioned\r\nto say nothing about her examination to her aunt, who was next to appear\r\nbefore them.  Madame Elisabeth, her niece declares, “replied with still\r\nmore contempt to their shocking questions.”\r\n\r\nThe only intimation of the Queen’s fate which her daughter and her\r\nsister-in-law were allowed to receive was through hearing her sentence\r\ncried by the newsman.  But “we could not persuade ourselves that she was\r\ndead,” writes Madame Royale.  “A hope, so natural to the unfortunate,\r\npersuaded us that she must have been saved.  For eighteen months I\r\nremained in this cruel suspense.  We learnt also by the cries of the\r\nnewsman the death of the Duc d’Orleans. It was the only piece of news\r\nthat reached us during the whole winter.”\r\n\r\n[The Duc d’Orleans, the early and interested propagator of the Revolution,\r\nwas its next victim.  Billaud Varennes said in the Convention: “The time\r\nhas come when all the conspirators should be known and struck.  I demand\r\nthat we no longer pass over in silence a man whom we seem to have\r\nforgotten, despite the numerous facts against him.  I demand that\r\nD’ORLEANS be sent to the Revolutionary Tribunal.”  The Convention, once\r\nhis hireling adulators, unanimously supported the proposal.  In vain he\r\nalleged his having been accessory to the disorders of 5th October, his\r\nsupport of the revolt on 10th August, 1792, his vote against the King on\r\n17th January, 1793.  His condemnation was pronounced.  He then asked only\r\nfor a delay of twenty-four hours, and had a repast carefully prepared, on\r\nwhich he feasted with avidity.  When led out for execution he gazed with a\r\nsmile on the Palais Royal, the scene of his former orgies. He was detained\r\nfor a quarter of an hour before that palace by the order of Robespierre,\r\nwho had asked his daughter’s hand, and promised in return to excite a\r\ntumult in which the Duke’s life should be saved.  Depraved though he was,\r\nhe would not consent to such a sacrifice, and he met his fate with stoical\r\nfortitude.--ALLISON, vol. iii., p. 172.]\r\n\r\nThe severity with which the prisoners were treated was carried into every\r\ndetail of their life.  The officers who guarded them took away their\r\nchessmen and cards because some of them were named kings and queens, and\r\nall the books with coats of arms on them; they refused to get ointment for\r\na gathering on Madame Elisabeth’s arm; they, would not allow her to make a\r\nherb-tea which she thought would strengthen her niece; they declined to\r\nsupply fish or eggs on fast-days or during Lent, bringing only coarse fat\r\nmeat, and brutally replying to all remonstances, “None but fools believe\r\nin that stuff nowadays.”  Madame Elisabeth never made the officials\r\nanother request, but reserved some of the bread and cafe-au-lait from her\r\nbreakfast for her second meal.  The time during which she could be thus\r\ntormented was growing short.\r\n\r\nOn 9th May, 1794, as the Princesses were going to bed, the outside bolts\r\nof the door were unfastened and a loud knocking was heard.  “When my aunt\r\nwas dressed,” says Madame Royale, “she opened the door, and they said to\r\nher, ‘Citoyenne, come down.’--‘And my niece?’--‘We shall take care of her\r\nafterwards.’ She embraced me, and to calm my agitation promised to return.\r\n‘No, citoyenne,’ said the men, ‘bring your bonnet; you shall not return.’\r\nThey overwhelmed her with abuse, but she bore it patiently, embracing me,\r\nand exhorting me to trust in Heaven, and never to forget the last commands\r\nof my father and mother.”\r\n\r\nMadame Elisabeth was then taken to the Conciergerie, where she was\r\ninterrogated by the vice-president at midnight, and then allowed to take\r\nsome hours rest on the bed on which Marie Antoinette had slept for the\r\nlast time.  In the morning she was brought before the tribunal, with\r\ntwenty-four other prisoners, of varying ages and both sexes, some of whom\r\nhad once been frequently seen at Court.\r\n\r\n“Of what has Elisabeth to complain?”  Fouquier-Tinville satirically asked.\r\n“At the foot of the guillotine, surrounded by faithful nobility, she may\r\nimagine herself again at Versailles.”\r\n\r\n“You call my brother a tyrant,” the Princess replied to her accuser; “if\r\nhe had been what you say, you would not be where you are, nor I before\r\nyou!”\r\n\r\nShe was sentenced to death, and showed neither surprise nor grief.  “I am\r\nready to die,” she said, “happy in the prospect of rejoining in a better\r\nworld those whom I loved on earth.”\r\n\r\nOn being taken to the room where those condemned to suffer at the same\r\ntime as herself were assembled, she spoke to them with so much piety and\r\nresignation that they were encouraged by her example to show calmness and\r\ncourage like her own.  The women, on leaving the cart, begged to embrace\r\nher, and she said some words of comfort to each in turn as they mounted\r\nthe scaffold, which she was not allowed to ascend till all her companions\r\nhad been executed before her eyes.\r\n\r\n[Madame Elisabeth was one of those rare personages only seen at distant\r\nintervals during the course of ages; she set an example of steadfast piety\r\nin the palace of kings, she lived amid her family the favourite of all and\r\nthe admiration of the world ....  When I went to Versailles Madame\r\nElisabeth was twenty-two years of age. Her plump figure and pretty pink\r\ncolour must have attracted notice, and her air of calmness and contentment\r\neven more than her beauty. She was fond of billiards, and her elegance and\r\ncourage in riding were remarkable.  But she never allowed these amusements\r\nto interfere with her religious observances.  At that time her wish to\r\ntake the veil at St. Cyr was much talked of, but the King was too fond of\r\nhis sister to endure the separation.  There were also rumours of a\r\nmarriage between Madame Elisabeth and the Emperor Joseph.  The Queen was\r\nsincerely attached to her brother, and loved her sister-in-law most\r\ntenderly; she ardently desired this marriage as a means of raising the\r\nPrincess to one of the first thrones in Europe, and as a possible means of\r\nturning the Emperor from his innovations.  She had been very carefully\r\neducated, had talent in music and painting, spoke Italian and a little\r\nLatin, and understood mathematics....  Her last moments were worthy of her\r\ncourage and virtue.--D’HEZECQUES’s “Recollections,” pp. 72-75.]\r\n\r\n“It is impossible to imagine my distress at finding myself separated from\r\nmy aunt,” says Madame Royale.  “Since I had been able to appreciate her\r\nmerits, I saw in her nothing but religion, gentleness, meekness, modesty,\r\nand a devoted attachment to her family; she sacrificed her life for them,\r\nsince nothing could persuade her to leave the King and Queen.  I never can\r\nbe sufficiently grateful to her for her goodness to me, which ended only\r\nwith her life.  She looked on me as her child, and I honoured and loved\r\nher as a second mother.  I was thought to be very like her in countenance,\r\nand I feel conscious that I have something of her character. Would to God\r\nI might imitate her virtues, and hope that I may hereafter deserve to meet\r\nher, as well as my dear parents, in the bosom of our Creator, where I\r\ncannot doubt that they enjoy the reward of their virtuous lives and\r\nmeritorious deaths.”\r\n\r\nMadame Royale vainly begged to be allowed to rejoin her mother or her\r\naunt, or at least to know their fate.  The municipal officers would tell\r\nher nothing, and rudely refused her request to have a woman placed with\r\nher.  “I asked nothing but what seemed indispensable, though it was often\r\nharshly refused,” she says.  “But I at least could keep myself clean.  I\r\nhad soap and water, and carefully swept out my room every day.  I had no\r\nlight, but in the long days I did not feel this privation much .  .  .  .\r\nI had some religious works and travels, which I had read over and over. I\r\nhad also some knitting, ‘qui m’ennuyait beaucoup’.”  Once, she believes,\r\nRobespierre visited her prison:\r\n\r\n[It has been said that Robespierre vainly tried to obtain the hand of\r\nMademoiselle d’Orleans.  It was also rumoured that Madame Royale herself\r\nowed her life to his matrimonial ambition.]\r\n\r\n“The officers showed him great respect; the people in the Tower did not\r\nknow him, or at least would not tell me who he was.  He stared insolently\r\nat me, glanced at my books, and, after joining the municipal officers in a\r\nsearch, retired.”\r\n\r\n[On another occasion “three men in scarfs,” who entered the Princess’s\r\nroom, told her that they did not see why she should wish to be released,\r\nas she seemed very comfortable!  “It is dreadful,’ I replied, ‘to be\r\nseparated for more than a year from one’s mother, without even hearing\r\nwhat has become of her or of my aunt.’--‘You are not ill?’--‘No, monsieur,\r\nbut the cruellest illness is that of the heart’--’ We can do nothing for\r\nyou.  Be patient, and submit to the justice and goodness of the French\r\npeople: I had nothing more to say.”--DUCHESSE D’ANGOULEME, “Royal\r\nMemoirs,” p. 273.]\r\n\r\nWhen Laurent was appointed by the Convention to the charge of the young\r\nprisoners, Madame Royale was treated with more consideration.  “He was\r\nalways courteous,” she says; he restored her tinderbox, gave her fresh\r\nbooks, and allowed her candles and as much firewood as she wanted, “which\r\npleased me greatly.”  This simple expression of relief gives a clearer\r\nidea of what the delicate girl must have suffered than a volume of\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\nBut however hard Madame Royale’s lot might be, that of the Dauphin was\r\ninfinitely harder.  Though only eight years old when he entered the\r\nTemple, he was by nature and education extremely precocious; “his memory\r\nretained everything, and his sensitiveness comprehended everything.”  His\r\nfeatures “recalled the somewhat effeminate look of Louis XV., and the\r\nAustrian hauteur of Maria Theresa; his blue eyes, aquiline nose, elevated\r\nnostrils, well-defined mouth, pouting lips, chestnut hair parted in the\r\nmiddle and falling in thick curls on his shoulders, resembled his mother\r\nbefore her years of tears and torture.  All the beauty of his race, by\r\nboth descents, seemed to reappear in him.”--[Lamartine]--For some time the\r\ncare of his parents preserved his health and cheerfulness even in the\r\nTemple; but his constitution was weakened by the fever recorded by his\r\nsister, and his gaolers were determined that he should never regain\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n“What does the Convention intend to do with him?” asked Simon, when the\r\ninnocent victim was placed in his clutches.  “Transport him?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Kill him?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Poison him?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“What, then?”\r\n\r\n“Why, get rid of him.”\r\n\r\nFor such a purpose they could not have chosen their instruments better.\r\n“Simon and his wife, cut off all those fair locks that had been his\r\nyouthful glory and his mother’s pride.  This worthy pair stripped him of\r\nthe mourning he wore for his father; and as they did so, they called it\r\n‘playing at the game of the spoiled king.’  They alternately induced him\r\nto commit excesses, and then half starved him.  They beat him mercilessly;\r\nnor was the treatment by night less brutal than that by day. As soon as\r\nthe weary boy had sunk into his first profound sleep, they would loudly\r\ncall him by name, ‘Capet!  Capet!’ Startled, nervous, bathed in\r\nperspiration, or sometimes trembling with cold, he would spring up, rush\r\nthrough the dark, and present himself at Simon’s bedside, murmuring,\r\ntremblingly, ‘I am here, citizen.’--‘Come nearer; let me feel you.’ He\r\nwould approach the bed as he was ordered, although he knew the treatment\r\nthat awaited him.  Simon would buffet him on the head, or kick him away,\r\nadding the remark, ‘Get to bed again, wolfs cub; I only wanted to know\r\nthat you were safe.’  On one of these occasions, when the child had fallen\r\nhalf stunned upon his own miserable couch, and lay there groaning and\r\nfaint with pain, Simon roared out with a laugh, ‘Suppose you were king,\r\nCapet, what would you do to me?’ The child thought of his father’s dying\r\nwords, and said, ‘I would forgive you.’”--[THIERS]\r\n\r\nThe change in the young Prince’s mode of life, and the cruelties and\r\ncaprices to which he was subjected, soon made him fall ill, says his\r\nsister.  “Simon forced him to eat to excess, and to drink large quantities\r\nof wine, which he detested .  .  .  .  He grew extremely fat without\r\nincreasing in height or strength.”  His aunt and sister, deprived of the\r\npleasure of tending him, had the pain of hearing his childish voice raised\r\nin the abominable songs his gaolers taught him.  The brutality of Simon\r\n“depraved at once the body and soul of his pupil.  He called him the young\r\nwolf of the Temple.  He treated him as the young of wild animals are\r\ntreated when taken from the mother and reduced to captivity,--at once\r\nintimidated by blows and enervated by taming.  He punished for\r\nsensibility; he rewarded meanness; he encouraged vice; he made the child\r\nwait on him at table, sometimes striking him on the face with a knotted\r\ntowel, sometimes raising the poker and threatening to strike him with it.”\r\n\r\n[Simon left the Temple to become a municipal officer.  He was involved in\r\nthe overthrow of Robespierre, and guillotined the day after him, 29th\r\nJuly, 1794.]\r\n\r\nYet when Simon was removed the poor young Prince’s condition became even\r\nworse.  His horrible loneliness induced an apathetic stupor to which any\r\nsuffering would have been preferable.  “He passed his days without any\r\nkind of occupation; they did not allow him light in the evening.  His\r\nkeepers never approached him but to give him food;” and on the rare\r\noccasions when they took him to the platform of the Tower, he was unable\r\nor unwilling to move about.  When, in November, 1794, a commissary named\r\nGomin arrived at the Temple, disposed to treat the little prisoner with\r\nkindness, it was too late.  “He took extreme care of my brother,” says\r\nMadame Royale.  “For a long time the unhappy child had been shut up in\r\ndarkness, and he was dying of fright.  He was very grateful for the\r\nattentions of Gomin, and became much attached to him.”  But his physical\r\ncondition was alarming, and, owing to Gomin’s representations, a\r\ncommission was instituted to examine him.  “The commissioners appointed\r\nwere Harmond, Mathieu, and Reverchon, who visited ‘Louis Charles,’ as he\r\nwas now called, in the month of February, 1795.  They found the young\r\nPrince seated at a square deal table, at which he was playing with some\r\ndirty cards, making card houses and the like,--the materials having been\r\nfurnished him, probably, that they might figure in the report as evidences\r\nof indulgence.  He did not look up from the table as the commissioners\r\nentered.  He was in a slate-coloured dress, bareheaded; the room was\r\nreported as clean, the bed in good condition, the linen fresh; his clothes\r\nwere also reported as new; but, in spite of all these assertions, it is\r\nwell known that his bed had not been made for months, that he had not left\r\nhis room, nor was permitted to leave it, for any purpose whatever, that it\r\nwas consequently uninhabitable, and that he was covered with vermin and\r\nwith sores.  The swellings at his knees alone were sufficient to disable\r\nhim from walking.  One of the commissioners approached the young Prince\r\nrespectfully.  The latter did not raise his head.  Harmond in a kind voice\r\nbegged him to speak to them.  The eyes of the boy remained fixed on the\r\ntable before him.  They told him of the kindly intentions of the\r\nGovernment, of their hopes that he would yet be happy, and their desire\r\nthat he would speak unreservedly to the medical man that was to visit him.\r\nHe seemed to listen with profound attention, but not a single word passed\r\nhis lips.  It was an heroic principle that impelled that poor young heart\r\nto maintain the silence of a mute in presence of these men.  He remembered\r\ntoo well the days when three other commissaries waited on him, regaled him\r\nwith pastry and wine, and obtained from him that hellish accusation\r\nagainst the mother that he loved.  He had learnt by some means the import\r\nof the act, so far as it was an injury to his mother.  He now dreaded\r\nseeing again three commissaries, hearing again kind words, and being\r\ntreated again with fine promises.  Dumb as death itself he sat before\r\nthem, and remained motionless as stone, and as mute.” [THIERS]\r\n\r\nHis disease now made rapid progress, and Gomin and Lasne, superintendents\r\nof the Temple, thinking it necessary to inform the Government of the\r\nmelancholy condition of their prisoner, wrote on the register: “Little\r\nCapet is unwell.”  No notice was taken of this account, which was renewed\r\nnext day in more urgent terms: “Little Capet is dangerously ill.”  Still\r\nthere was no word from beyond the walls.  “We must knock harder,” said the\r\nkeepers to each other, and they added, “It is feared he will not live,” to\r\nthe words “dangerously ill.”  At length, on Wednesday, 6th May, 1795,\r\nthree days after the first report, the authorities appointed M. Desault to\r\ngive the invalid the assistance of his art.  After having written down his\r\nname on the register he was admitted to see the Prince. He made a long and\r\nvery attentive examination of the unfortunate child, asked him many\r\nquestions without being able to obtain an answer, and contented himself\r\nwith prescribing a decoction of hops, to be taken by spoonfuls every\r\nhalf-hour, from six o’clock in the morning till eight in the evening.  On\r\nthe first day the Prince steadily refused to take it. In vain Gomin\r\nseveral times drank off a glass of the potion in his presence; his example\r\nproved as ineffectual as his words.  Next day Lasne renewed his\r\nsolicitations.  “Monsieur knows very well that I desire nothing but the\r\ngood of his health, and he distresses me deeply by thus refusing to take\r\nwhat might contribute to it.  I entreat him as a favour not to give me\r\nthis cause of grief.”  And as Lasne, while speaking, began to taste the\r\npotion in a glass, the child took what he offered him out of his hands.\r\n“You have, then, taken an oath that I should drink it,” said he, firmly;\r\n“well, give it me, I will drink it.”  From that moment he conformed with\r\ndocility to whatever was required of him, but the policy of the Commune\r\nhad attained its object; help had been withheld till it was almost a\r\nmockery to supply it.\r\n\r\nThe Prince’s weakness was excessive; his keepers could scarcely drag him\r\nto the, top of the Tower; walking hurt his tender feet, and at every step\r\nhe stopped to press the arm of Lasne with both hands upon his breast.  At\r\nlast he suffered so much that it was no longer possible for him to walk,\r\nand his keeper carried him about, sometimes on the platform, and sometimes\r\nin the little tower, where the royal family had lived at first. But the\r\nslight improvement to his health occasioned by the change of air scarcely\r\ncompensated for the pain which his fatigue gave him.  On the battlement of\r\nthe platform nearest the left turret, the rain had, by perseverance\r\nthrough ages, hollowed out a kind of basin.  The water that fell remained\r\nthere for several days; and as, during the spring of 1795, storms were of\r\nfrequent occurrence, this little sheet of water was kept constantly\r\nsupplied.  Whenever the child was brought out upon the platform, he saw a\r\nlittle troop of sparrows, which used to come to drink and bathe in this\r\nreservoir.  At first they flew away at his approach, but from being\r\naccustomed to see him walking quietly there every day, they at last grew\r\nmore familiar, and did not spread their wings for flight till he came up\r\nclose to them.  They were always the same, he knew them by sight, and\r\nperhaps like himself they were inhabitants of that ancient pile.  He\r\ncalled them his birds; and his first action, when the door into the\r\nterrace was opened, was to look towards that side,--and the sparrows were\r\nalways there.  He delighted in their chirping, and he must have envied\r\nthem their wings.\r\n\r\nThough so little could be done to alleviate his sufferings, a moral\r\nimprovement was taking place in him.  He was touched by the lively\r\ninterest displayed by his physician, who never failed to visit him at nine\r\no’clock every morning.  He seemed pleased with the attention paid him, and\r\nended by placing entire confidence in M. Desault.  Gratitude loosened his\r\ntongue; brutality and insult had failed to extort a murmur, but kind\r\ntreatment restored his speech he had no words for anger, but he found them\r\nto express his thanks.  M. Desault prolonged his visits as long as the\r\nofficers of the municipality would permit.  When they announced the close\r\nof the visit, the child, unwilling to beg them to allow a longer time,\r\nheld back M. Desault by the skirt of his coat. Suddenly M. Desault’s\r\nvisits ceased.  Several days passed and nothing was heard of him.  The\r\nkeepers wondered at his absence, and the poor little invalid was much\r\ndistressed at it.  The commissary on duty (M. Benoist) suggested that it\r\nwould be proper to send to the physician’s house to make inquiries as to\r\nthe cause of so long an absence.  Gomin and Larne had not yet ventured to\r\nfollow this advice, when next day M. Benoist was relieved by M. Bidault,\r\nwho, hearing M. Desault’s name mentioned as he came in, immediately said,\r\n“You must not expect to see him any more; he died yesterday.”\r\n\r\nM. Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de l’Humanite, was next\r\ndirected to attend the prisoner, and in June he found him in so alarming a\r\nstate that he at once asked for a coadjutor, fearing to undertake the\r\nresponsibility alone.  The physician--sent for form’s sake to attend the\r\ndying child, as an advocate is given by law to a criminal condemned\r\nbeforehand--blamed the officers of the municipality for not having removed\r\nthe blind, which obstructed the light, and the numerous bolts, the noise\r\nof which never failed to remind the victim of his captivity. That sound,\r\nwhich always caused him an involuntary shudder, disturbed him in the last\r\nmournful scene of his unparalleled tortures.  M. Pelletan said\r\nauthoritatively to the municipal on duty, “If you will not take these\r\nbolts and casings away at once, at least you can make no objection to our\r\ncarrying the child into another room, for I suppose we are sent here to\r\ntake charge of him.”  The Prince, being disturbed by these words, spoken\r\nas they were with great animation, made a sign to the physician to come\r\nnearer.  “Speak lower, I beg of you,” said he; “I am afraid they will hear\r\nyou up-stairs, and I should be very sorry for them to know that I am ill,\r\nas it would give them much uneasiness.”\r\n\r\nAt first the change to a cheerful and airy room revived the Prince and\r\ngave him evident pleasure, but the improvement did not last.  Next day M.\r\nPelletan learned that the Government had acceded to his request for a\r\ncolleague.  M. Dumangin, head physician of the Hospice de l’Unite, made\r\nhis appearance at his house on the morning of Sunday, 7th June, with the\r\nofficial despatch sent him by the committee of public safety.  They\r\nrepaired together immediately to the Tower.  On their arrival they heard\r\nthat the child, whose weakness was excessive, had had a fainting fit,\r\nwhich had occasioned fears to be entertained that his end was approaching.\r\nHe had revived a little, however, when the physicians went up at about\r\nnine o’clock.  Unable to contend with increasing exhaustion, they\r\nperceived there was no longer any hope of prolonging an existence worn out\r\nby so much suffering, and that all their art could effect would be to\r\nsoften the last stage of this lamentable disease.  While standing by the\r\nPrince’s bed, Gomin noticed that he was quietly crying, and asked him.\r\nkindly what was the matter.  “I am always alone,” he said.  “My dear\r\nmother remains in the other tower.”  Night came,--his last night,--which\r\nthe regulations of the prison condemned him to pass once more in solitude,\r\nwith suffering, his old companion, only at his side.  This time, however,\r\ndeath, too, stood at his pillow.  When Gomin went up to the child’s room\r\non the morning of 8th June, he said, seeing him calm, motionless, and\r\nmute:\r\n\r\n“I hope you are not in pain just now?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I am still in pain, but not nearly so much,--the music is so\r\nbeautiful!”\r\n\r\nNow there was no music to be heard, either in the Tower or anywhere near.\r\n\r\nGomin, astonished, said to him, “From what direction do you hear this\r\nmusic?”\r\n\r\n“From above!”\r\n\r\n“Have you heard it long?”\r\n\r\n“Since you knelt down.  Do you not hear it?  Listen!  Listen!”  And the\r\nchild, with a nervous motion, raised his faltering hand, as he opened his\r\nlarge eyes illuminated by delight.  His poor keeper, unwilling to destroy\r\nthis last sweet illusion, appeared to listen also.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes of attention the child again started, and cried out,\r\nin intense rapture, “Amongst all the voices I have distinguished that of\r\nmy mother!”\r\n\r\nThese were almost his last words.  At a quarter past two he died, Lasne\r\nonly being in the room at the time.  Lasne acquainted Gomin and Damont,\r\nthe commissary on duty, with the event, and they repaired to the chamber\r\nof death.  The poor little royal corpse was carried from the room into\r\nthat where he had suffered so long,--where for two years he had never\r\nceased to suffer.  From this apartment the father had gone to the\r\nscaffold, and thence the son must pass to the burial-ground.  The remains\r\nwere laid out on the bed, and the doors of the apartment were set\r\nopen,--doors which had remained closed ever since the Revolution had\r\nseized on a child, then full of vigour and grace and life and health!\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock next morning (9th June) four members of the committee of\r\ngeneral safety came to the Tower to make sure that the Prince was really\r\ndead.  When they were admitted to the death-chamber by Lasne and Damont\r\nthey affected the greatest indifference.  “The event is not of the least\r\nimportance,” they repeated, several times over; “the police commissary of\r\nthe section will come and receive the declaration of the decease; he will\r\nacknowledge it, and proceed to the interment without any ceremony; and the\r\ncommittee will give the necessary directions.”  As they withdrew, some\r\nofficers of the Temple guard asked to see the remains of little Capet.\r\nDamont having observed that the guard would not permit the bier to pass\r\nwithout its being opened, the deputies decided that the officers and\r\nnon-commissioned officers of the guard going off duty, together with those\r\ncoming on, should be all invited to assure themselves of the child’s\r\ndeath.  All having assembled in the room where the body lay, he asked them\r\nif they recognised it as that of the ex-Dauphin, son of the last King of\r\nFrance.  Those who had seen the young Prince at the Tuileries, or at the\r\nTemple (and most of them had), bore witness to its being the body of Louis\r\nXVII.  When they were come down into the council-room, Darlot drew up the\r\nminutes of this attestation, which was signed by a score of persons.\r\nThese minutes were inserted in the journal of the Temple tower, which was\r\nafterwards deposited in the office of the Minister of the Interior.\r\n\r\nDuring this visit the surgeons entrusted with the autopsy arrived at the\r\nouter gate of the Temple.  These were Dumangin, head physician of the\r\nHospice de l’Unite; Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de\r\nl’Humanite; Jeanroy, professor in the medical schools of Paris; and\r\nLaasus, professor of legal medicine at the Ecole de Sante of Paris. The\r\nlast two were selected by Dumangin and Pelletan because of the former\r\nconnection of M. Lassus with Mesdames de France, and of M. Jeanroy with\r\nthe House of Lorraine, which gave a peculiar weight to their signatures.\r\nGomin received them in the council-room, and detained them until the\r\nNational Guard, descending from the second floor, entered to sign the\r\nminutes prepared by Darlot.  This done, Lasne, Darlot, and Bouquet went up\r\nagain with the surgeons, and introduced them into the apartment of Louis\r\nXVII., whom they at first examined as he lay on his death-bed; but M.\r\nJeanroy observing that the dim light of this room was but little\r\nfavourable to the accomplishment of their mission, the commissaries\r\nprepared a table in the first room, near the window, on which the corpse\r\nwas laid, and the surgeons began their melancholy operation.\r\n\r\nAt seven o’clock the police commissary ordered the body to be taken up,\r\nand that they should proceed to the cemetery.  It was the season of the\r\nlongest days, and therefore the interment did not take place in secrecy\r\nand at night, as some misinformed narrators have said or written; it took\r\nplace in broad daylight, and attracted a great concourse of people before\r\nthe gates of the Temple palace.  One of the municipals wished to have the\r\ncoffin carried out secretly by the door opening into the chapel enclosure;\r\nbut M. Duaser, police commiasary, who was specially entrusted with the\r\narrangement of the ceremony, opposed this indecorous measure, and the\r\nprocession passed out through the great gate.  The crowd that was pressing\r\nround was kept back, and compelled to keep a line, by a tricoloured\r\nribbon, held at short distances by gendarmes.  Compassion and sorrow were\r\nimpressed on every countenance.\r\n\r\nA small detachment of the troops of the line from the garrison of Paris,\r\nsent by the authorities, was waiting to serve as an escort.  The bier,\r\nstill covered with the pall, was carried on a litter on the shoulders of\r\nfour men, who relieved each other two at a time; it was preceded by six or\r\neight men, headed by a sergeant.  The procession was accompanied a long\r\nway by the crowd, and a great number of persona followed it even to the\r\ncemetery.  The name of “Little Capet,” and the more popular title of\r\nDauphin, spread from lip to lip, with exclamations of pity and compassion.\r\nThe funeral entered the cemetery of Ste. Marguerite, not by the church, as\r\nsome accounts assert, but by the old gate of the cemetery. The interment\r\nwas made in the corner, on the left, at a distance of eight or nine feet\r\nfrom the enclosure wall, and at an equal distance from a small house,\r\nwhich subsequently served as a school.  The grave was filled up,--no mound\r\nmarked its place, and not even a trace remained of the interment!  Not\r\ntill then did the commissaries of police and the municipality withdraw,\r\nand enter the house opposite the church to draw up the declaration of\r\ninterment.  It was nearly nine o’clock, and still daylight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease of Madame Royale.--Her Marriage to the Duc d’Angouleme.\r\n--Return to France.--Death.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last person to hear of the sad events in the Temple was the one for\r\nwhom they had the deepest and most painful interest.  After her brother’s\r\ndeath the captivity of Madame Royale was much lightened.  She was allowed\r\nto walk in the Temple gardens, and to receive visits from some ladies of\r\nthe old Court, and from Madame de Chantereine, who at last, after several\r\ntimes evading her questions, ventured cautiously to tell her of the deaths\r\nof her mother, aunt, and brother.  Madame Royale wept bitterly, but had\r\nmuch difficulty in expressing her feelings.  “She spoke so confusedly,”\r\n says Madame de la Ramiere in a letter to Madame de Verneuil, “that it was\r\ndifficult to understand her.  It took her more than a month’s reading\r\naloud, with careful study of pronunciation, to make herself\r\nintelligible,--so much had she lost the power of expression.” She was\r\ndressed with plainness amounting to poverty, and her hands were disfigured\r\nby exposure to cold and by the menial work she had been so long accustomed\r\nto do for herself, and which it was difficult to persuade her to leave\r\noff.  When urged to accept the services of an attendant, she replied, with\r\na sad prevision of the vicissitudes of her future life, that she did not\r\nlike to form a habit which she might have again to abandon.  She suffered\r\nherself, however, to be persuaded gradually to modify her recluse and\r\nascetic habits.  It was well she did so, as a preparation for the great\r\nchanges about to follow.\r\n\r\nNine days after the death of her brother, the city of Orleans interceded\r\nfor the daughter of Louis XVI., and sent deputies to the Convention to\r\npray for her deliverance and restoration to her family.  Names followed\r\nthis example; and Charette, on the part of the Vendeans, demanded, as a\r\ncondition of the pacification of La Vendee, that the Princess should be\r\nallowed to join her relations.  At length the Convention decreed that\r\nMadame Royale should be exchanged with Austria for the representatives and\r\nministers whom Dumouriez had given up to the Prince of Cobourg,--Drouet,\r\nSemonville, Maret, and other prisoners of importance.  At midnight on 19th\r\nDecember, 1795, which was her birthday, the Princess was released from\r\nprison, the Minister of the Interior, M. Benezech, to avoid attracting\r\npublic attention and possible disturbance, conducting her on foot from the\r\nTemple to a neighbouring street, where his carriage awaited her.  She made\r\nit her particular request that Gomin, who had been so devoted to her\r\nbrother, should be the commissary appointed to accompany her to the\r\nfrontier; Madame de Soucy, formerly under-governess to the children of\r\nFrance, was also in attendance; and the Princess took with her a dog named\r\nCoco, which had belonged to Louis XVI.\r\n\r\n[The mention of the little dog taken from the Temple by Madame Royale\r\nreminds me how fond all the family were of these creatures. Each Princess\r\nkept a different kind.  Mesdames had beautiful spaniels; little grayhounds\r\nwere preferred by Madame Elisabeth. Louis XVI. was the only one of all his\r\nfamily who had no dogs in his room.  I remember one day waiting in the\r\ngreat gallery for the King’s retiring, when he entered with all his family\r\nand the whole pack, who were escorting him.  All at once all the dogs\r\nbegan to bark, one louder than another, and ran away, passing like ghosts\r\nalong those great dark rooms, which rang with their hoarse cries. The\r\nPrincesses shouting, calling them, running everywhere after them,\r\ncompleted a ridiculous spectacle, which made those august persons very\r\nmerry.--D’HEZECQUES, p. 49.]\r\n\r\nShe was frequently recognised on her way through France, and always with\r\nmarks of pleasure and respect.\r\n\r\nIt might have been supposed that the Princess would rejoice to leave\r\nbehind her the country which had been the scene of so many horrors and\r\nsuch bitter suffering.  But it was her birthplace, and it held the graves\r\nof all she loved; and as she crossed the frontier she said to those around\r\nher, “I leave France with regret, for I shall never cease to consider it\r\nmy country.”  She arrived in Vienna on 9th January, 1796, and her first\r\ncare was to attend a memorial service for her murdered relatives.  After\r\nmany weeks of close retirement she occasionally began to appear in public,\r\nand people looked with interest at the pale, grave, slender girl of\r\nseventeen, dressed in the deepest mourning, over whose young head such\r\nterrible storms had swept.  The Emperor wished her to marry the Archduke\r\nCharles of Austria, but her father and mother had, even in the cradle,\r\ndestined her hand for her cousin, the Duc d’Angouleme, son of the Comte\r\nd’Artois, and the memory of their lightest wish was law to her.\r\n\r\nHer quiet determination entailed anger and opposition amounting to\r\npersecution.  Every effort was made to alienate her from her French\r\nrelations.  She was urged to claim Provence, which had become her own if\r\nLouis XVIII.  was to be considered King of France.  A pressure of opinion\r\nwas brought to bear upon her which might well have overawed so young a\r\ngirl.  “I was sent for to the Emperor’s cabinet,” she writes, “where I\r\nfound the imperial family assembled.  The ministers and chief imperial\r\ncounsellors were also present .  .  .  .  When the Emperor invited me to\r\nexpress my opinion, I answered that to be able to treat fittingly of such\r\ninterests I thought, I ought to be surrounded not only by my mother’s\r\nrelatives, but also by those of my father .  .  .  .  Besides, I said, I\r\nwas above all things French, and in entire subjection to the laws of\r\nFrance, which had rendered me alternately the subject of the King my\r\nfather, the King my brother, and the King my uncle, and that I would yield\r\nobedience to the latter, whatever might be his commands.  This declaration\r\nappeared very much to dissatisfy all who were present, and when they\r\nobserved that I was not to be shaken, they declared that my right being\r\nindependent of my will, my resistance would not be the slightest obstacle\r\nto the measures they might deem it necessary to adopt for the preservation\r\nof my interests.”\r\n\r\nIn their anxiety to make a German princess of Marie Therese, her imperial\r\nrelations suppressed her French title as much as possible.  When, with\r\nsome difficulty, the Duc de Grammont succeeded in obtaining an audience of\r\nher, and used the familiar form of address, she smiled faintly, and bade\r\nhim beware.  “Call me Madame de Bretagne, or de Bourgogne, or de\r\nLorraine,” she said, “for here I am so identified with these\r\nprovinces--[which the Emperor wished her to claim from her uncle Louis\r\nXVIII.]--that I shall end in believing in my own transformation.”  After\r\nthese discussions she was so closely watched, and so many restraints were\r\nimposed upon her, that she was scarcely less a prisoner than in the old\r\ndays of the Temple, though her cage was this time gilded.  Rescue,\r\nhowever, was at hand.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 Louis XVIII. accepted a refuge offered to him at Mittau by the\r\nCzar Paul, who had promised that he would grant his guest’s first request,\r\nwhatever it might be.  Louis begged the Czar to use his influence with the\r\nCourt of Vienna to allow his niece to join him. “Monsieur, my brother,”\r\n was Paul’s answer, “Madame Royale shall be restored to you, or I shall\r\ncease to be Paul I.”  Next morning the Czar despatched a courier to Vienna\r\nwith a demand for the Princess, so energetically worded that refusal must\r\nhave been followed by war. Accordingly, in May, 1799, Madame Royale was\r\nallowed to leave the capital which she had found so uncongenial an asylum.\r\n\r\nIn the old ducal castle of Mittau, the capital of Courland, Louis XVIII.\r\nand his wife, with their nephews, the Ducs d’Angouleme and de Berri,\r\nwere awaiting her, attended by the Abbe Edgeworth, as chief\r\necclesiastic, and a little Court of refugee nobles and officers.\r\n\r\n[The Duc d’Angonleme was quiet and reserved.  He loved hunting as means of\r\nkilling time; was given to early hours and innocent pleasures.  He was a\r\ngentleman, and brave as became one.  He had not the “gentlemanly vices” of\r\nhis brother, and was all the better for it.  He was ill educated, but had\r\nnatural good sense, and would have passed for having more than that had he\r\ncared to put forth pretensions.  Of all his family he was the one most ill\r\nspoken of, and least deserving of it.--DOCTOR DORAN.]\r\n\r\nWith them were two men of humbler position, who must have been even more\r\nwelcome to Madame Royale,--De Malden, who had acted as courier to Louis\r\nXVI. during the flight to Varennes, and Turgi, who had waited on the\r\nPrincesses in the Temple.  It was a sad meeting, though so long anxiously\r\ndesired, and it was followed on 10th June, 1799, by an equally sad\r\nwedding,--exiles, pensioners on the bounty of the Russian monarch,\r\nfulfilling an engagement founded, not on personal preference, but on\r\nfamily policy and reverence for the wishes of the dead, the bride and\r\nbridegroom had small cause for rejoicing.  During the eighteen months of\r\ntranquil seclusion which followed her marriage, the favourite occupation\r\nof the Duchess was visiting and relieving the poor.  In January, 1801, the\r\nCzar Paul, in compliance with the demand of Napoleon, who was just then\r\nthe object of his capricious enthusiasm, ordered the French royal family\r\nto leave Mittau.  Their wanderings commenced on the 21st, a day of bitter\r\nmemories; and the young Duchess led the King to his carriage through a\r\ncrowd of men, women, and children, whose tears and blessings attended them\r\non their way.\r\n\r\n[The Queen was too ill to travel.  The Duc d’Angouleme took another route\r\nto join a body of French gentlemen in arms for the Legitimist cause.]\r\n\r\nThe exiles asked permission from the King of Prussia to settle in his\r\ndominions, and while awaiting his answer at Munich they were painfully\r\nsurprised by the entrance of five old soldiers of noble birth, part of the\r\nbody-guard they had left behind at Mittau, relying on the protection of\r\nPaul.  The “mad Czar” had decreed their immediate expulsion, and,\r\npenniless and almost starving, they made their way to Louis XVIII.  All\r\nthe money the royal family possessed was bestowed on these faithful\r\nservants, who came to them in detachments for relief, and then the Duchess\r\noffered her diamonds to the Danish consul for an advance of two thousand\r\nducats, saying she pledged her property “that in our common distress it\r\nmay be rendered of real use to my uncle, his faithful servants, and\r\nmyself.”  The Duchess’s consistent and unselfish kindness procured her\r\nfrom the King, and those about him who knew her best, the name of “our\r\nangel.”\r\n\r\nWarsaw was for a brief time the resting-place of the wanderers, but there\r\nthey were disturbed in 1803 by Napoleon’s attempt to threaten and bribe\r\nLouis XVIII. into abdication.  It was suggested that refusal might bring\r\nupon them expulsion from Prussia.  “We are accustomed to suffering,” was\r\nthe King’s answer, “and we do not dread poverty.  I would, trusting in\r\nGod, seek another asylum.”  In 1808, after many changes of scene, this\r\nasylum was sought in England, Gosfield Hall, Essex, being placed at their\r\ndisposal by the Marquis of Buckingham.  From Gosfield, the King moved to\r\nHartwell Hall, a fine old Elizabethan mansion rented from Sir George Lee\r\nfor L 500 a year.  A yearly grant of L 24,000 was made to the exiled\r\nfamily by the British Government, out of which a hundred and forty persons\r\nwere supported, the royal dinner-party generally numbering two dozen.\r\n\r\nAt Hartwell, as in her other homes, the Duchess was most popular amongst\r\nthe poor.  In general society she was cold and reserved, and she disliked\r\nthe notice of strangers.  In March, 1814, the royalist successes at\r\nBordeaux paved the way for the restoration of royalty in France, and\r\namidst general sympathy and congratulation, with the Prince Regent himself\r\nto wish them good fortune, the King, the Duchess, and their suite left\r\nHartwell in April, 1814.  The return to France was as triumphant as a\r\nsomewhat half-hearted and doubtful enthusiasm could make it, and most of\r\nsuch cordiality as there was fell to the share of the Duchess.  As she\r\npassed to Notre-Dame in May, 1814, on entering Paris, she was vociferously\r\ngreeted.  The feeling of loyalty, however, was not much longer-lived than\r\nthe applause by which it was expressed; the Duchess had scarcely effected\r\none of the strongest wishes of her heart,--the identification of what\r\nremained of her parents’ bodies, and the magnificent ceremony with which\r\nthey were removed from the cemetery of the Madeleine to the Abbey of St.\r\nDenis,--when the escape of Napoleon from Elba in February,1815, scattered\r\nthe royal family and their followers like chaff before the wind.  The Duc\r\nd’Angouleme, compelled to capitulate at Toulouse, sailed from Cette in a\r\nSwedish vessel.  The Comte d’Artois, the Duc de Berri, and the Prince de\r\nConde withdrew beyond the frontier.  The King fled from the capital.  The\r\nDuchesse d’Angouleme, then at Bordeaux celebrating the anniversary of the\r\nProclamation of Louis XVIII., alone of all her family made any stand\r\nagainst the general panic. Day after day she mounted her horse and\r\nreviewed the National Guard.  She made personal and even passionate\r\nappeals to the officers and men, standing firm, and prevailing on a\r\nhandful of soldiers to remain by her, even when the imperialist troops\r\nwere on the other side of the river and their cannon were directed against\r\nthe square where the Duchess was reviewing her scanty followers.\r\n\r\n[“It was the Duchesse d’Angouleme who saved you,” said the gallant General\r\nClauzel, after these events, to a royalist volunteer; “I could not bring\r\nmyself to order such a woman to be fired upon, at the moment when she was\r\nproviding material for the noblest page in her history.”--“Fillia\r\nDolorosa,” vol. vii., p. 131.]\r\n\r\nWith pain and difficulty she was convinced that resistance was vain;\r\nNapoleon’s banner soon floated over Bordeaux; the Duchess issued a\r\nfarewell proclamation to her “brave Bordelais,” and on the 1st April,\r\n1815, she started for Pouillac, whence she embarked for Spain.  During a\r\nbrief visit to England she heard that the reign of a hundred days was\r\nover, and the 27th of July, 1815, saw her second triumphal return to the\r\nTuileries.  She did not take up her abode there with any wish for State\r\nceremonies or Court gaieties.  Her life was as secluded as her position\r\nwould allow.  Her favourite retreat was the Pavilion, which had been\r\ninhabited by her mother, and in her little oratory she collected relics of\r\nher family, over which on the anniversaries of their deaths she wept and\r\nprayed.  In her daily drives through Paris she scrupulously avoided the\r\nspot on which they had suffered; and the memory of the past seemed to rule\r\nall her sad and self-denying life, both in what she did and what she\r\nrefrained from doing.\r\n\r\n[She was so methodical and economical, though liberal in her charities,\r\nthat one of her regular evening occupations was to tear off the seals from\r\nthe letters she had received during the day, in order that the wax might\r\nbe melted down and sold; the produce made one poor family “passing rich\r\nwith forty pounds a year.”--See “Filia Dolorosa,” vol. ii., p. 239.]\r\n\r\nHer somewhat austere goodness was not of a nature to make her popular. The\r\nfew who really understood her loved her, but the majority of her\r\npleasure-seeking subjects regarded her either with ridicule or dread. She\r\nis said to have taken no part in politics, and to have exerted no\r\ninfluence in public affairs, but her sympathies were well known, and “the\r\nvery word liberty made her shudder;” like Madame Roland, she had seen “so\r\nmany crimes perpetrated under that name.”\r\n\r\nThe claims of three pretended Dauphins--Hervagault, the son of the tailor\r\nof St. Lo; Bruneau, son of the shoemaker of Vergin; and Naundorf or\r\nNorndorff, the watchmaker somewhat troubled her peace, but never for a\r\nmoment obtained her sanction.  Of the many other pseudo-Dauphins (said to\r\nnumber a dozen and a half) not even the names remain.  In February,1820, a\r\nfresh tragedy befell the royal family in the assassination of the Duc de\r\nBerri, brother-in-law of the Duchesse d’Angouleme, as he was seeing his\r\nwife into her carriage at the door of the Opera-house.  He was carried\r\ninto the theatre, and there the dying Prince and his wife were joined by\r\nthe Duchess, who remained till he breathed his last, and was present when\r\nhe, too, was laid in the Abbey of St. Denis.  She was present also when\r\nhis son, the Duc de Bordeaux, was born, and hoped that she saw in him a\r\nguarantee for the stability of royalty in France.  In September, 1824, she\r\nstood by the death-bed of Louis XVIII., and thenceforward her chief\r\noccupation was directing the education of the little Duc de Bordeaux, who\r\ngenerally resided with her at Villeneuve l’Etang, her country house near\r\nSt.  Cloud.  Thence she went in July, 1830, to the Baths of Vichy,\r\nstopping at Dijon on her way to Paris, and visiting the theatre on the\r\nevening of the 27th.  She was received with “a roar of execrations and\r\nseditious cries,” and knew only too well what they signified.  She\r\ninstantly left the theatre and proceeded to Tonnere, where she received\r\nnews of the rising in Paris, and, quitting the town by night, was driven\r\nto Joigny with three attendants.  Soon after leaving that place it was\r\nthought more prudent that the party should separate and proceed on foot,\r\nand the Duchess and M. de Foucigny, disguised as peasants, entered\r\nVersailles arm-in-arm, to obtain tidings of the King. The Duchess found\r\nhim at Rambouillet with her husband, the Dauphin, and the King met her\r\nwith a request for “pardon,” being fully conscious, too late, that his\r\nunwise decrees and his headlong flight had destroyed the last hopes of his\r\nfamily.  The act of abdication followed, by which the prospect of royalty\r\npassed from the Dauphin and his wife, as well as from Charles X.--Henri V.\r\nbeing proclaimed King, and the Duc d’Orleans (who refused to take the boy\r\nmonarch under his personal protection) lieutenant-general of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThen began the Duchess’s third expatriation.  At Cherbourg the royal\r\nfamily, accompanied by the little King without a kingdom, embarked in the\r\n‘Great Britain’, which stood out to sea.  The Duchess, remaining on deck\r\nfor a last look at the coast of France, noticed a brig which kept, she\r\nthought, suspiciously near them.\r\n\r\n“Who commands that vessel?” she inquired.\r\n\r\n“Captain Thibault.”\r\n\r\nAnd what are his orders?”\r\n\r\n“To fire into and sink the vessels in which we sail, should any attempt be\r\nmade to return to France.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the farewell of their subjects to the House of Bourbon.  The\r\nfugitives landed at Weymouth; the Duchesse d’Angouleme under the title of\r\nComtesse de Marne, the Duchesse de Berri as Comtesse de Rosny, and her\r\nson, Henri de Bordeaux, as Comte de Chambord, the title he retained till\r\nhis death, originally taken from the estate presented to him in infancy by\r\nhis enthusiastic people.  Holyrood, with its royal and gloomy\r\nassociations, was their appointed dwelling.  The Duc and Duchesse\r\nd’Angouleme, and the daughter of the Duc de Berri, travelled thither by\r\nland, the King and the young Comte de Chambord by sea.  “I prefer my route\r\nto that of my sister,” observed the latter, “because I shall see the coast\r\nof France again, and she will not.”\r\n\r\nThe French Government soon complained that at Holyrood the exiles were\r\nstill too near their native land, and accordingly, in 1832, Charles X.,\r\nwith his son and grandson, left Scotland for Hamburg, while the Duchesse\r\nd’Angouleme and her niece repaired to Vienna.  The family were reunited at\r\nPrague in 1833, where the birthday of the Comte de Chambord was celebrated\r\nwith some pomp and rejoicing, many Legitimists flocking thither to\r\ncongratulate him on attaining the age of thirteen, which the old law of\r\nmonarchical France had fixed as the majority of her princes. Three years\r\nlater the wanderings of the unfortunate family recommenced; the Emperor\r\nFrancis II. was dead, and his successor, Ferdinand, must visit Prague to\r\nbe crowned, and Charles X. feared that the presence of a discrowned\r\nmonarch might be embarrassing on such an occasion.  Illness and sorrow\r\nattended the exiles on their new journey, and a few months after they were\r\nestablished in the Chateau of Graffenburg at Goritz, Charles X. died of\r\ncholera, in his eightieth year.  At Goritz, also, on the 31st May, 1844,\r\nthe Duchesse d’Angouleme, who had sat beside so many death-beds, watched\r\nover that of her husband.  Theirs had not been a marriage of affection in\r\nyouth, but they respected each other’s virtues, and to a great extent\r\nshared each other’s tastes; banishment and suffering had united them very\r\nclosely, and of late years they had been almost inseparable,--walking,\r\nriding, and reading together.  When the Duchesse d’Angouleme had seen her\r\nhusband laid by his father’s side in the vault of the Franciscan convent,\r\nshe, accompanied by her nephew and niece, removed to Frohsdorf, where they\r\nspent seven tranquil years.  Here she was addressed as “Queen” by her\r\nhousehold for the first time in her life, but she herself always\r\nrecognised Henri, Comte de Chambord, as her sovereign.  The Duchess lived\r\nto see the overthrow of Louis Philippe, the usurper of the inheritance of\r\nher family.  Her last attempt to exert herself was a characteristic one.\r\nShe tried to rise from a sick-bed in order to attend the memorial service\r\nheld for her mother, Marie Antoinette, on the 16th October, the\r\nanniversary of her execution.  But her strength was not equal to the task;\r\non the 19th she expired, with her hand in that of the Comte de Chambord,\r\nand on 28th October, 1851, Marie Therese Charlotte, Duchesse d’Angouleme,\r\nwas buried in the Franciscan convent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ceremony of Expiation.\r\n\r\n\r\n“In the spring of 1814 a ceremony took place in Paris at which I was\r\npresent because there was nothing in it that could be mortifying to a\r\nFrench heart.  The death of Louis XVI. had long been admitted to be one of\r\nthe most serious misfortunes of the Revolution.  The Emperor Napoleon\r\nnever spoke of that sovereign but in terms of the highest respect, and\r\nalways prefixed the epithet unfortunate to his name.  The ceremony to\r\nwhich I allude was proposed by the Emperor of Russia and the King of\r\nPrussia.  It consisted of a kind of expiation and purification of the spot\r\non which Louis XVI. and his Queen were beheaded.  I went to see the\r\nceremony, and I had a place at a window in the Hotel of Madame de Remusat,\r\nnext to the Hotel de Crillon, and what was termed the Hotel de Courlande.\r\n\r\n“The expiation took place on the 10th of April.  The weather was extremely\r\nfine and warm for the season.  The Emperor of Russia and King of Prussia,\r\naccompanied by Prince Schwartzenberg, took their station at the entrance\r\nof the Rue Royale; the King of Prussia being on the right of the Emperor\r\nAlexander, and Prince Schwartzenberg on his left.  There was a long\r\nparade, during which the Russian, Prussian and Austrian military bands\r\nvied with each other in playing the air, ‘Vive Henri IV.!’ The cavalry\r\ndefiled past, and then withdrew into the Champs Elysees; but the infantry\r\nranged themselves round an altar which was raised in the middle of the\r\nPlace, and which was elevated on a platform having twelve or fifteen\r\nsteps.  The Emperor of Russia alighted from his horse, and, followed by\r\nthe King of Prussia, the Grand Duke Constantine, Lord Cathcart, and Prince\r\nSchwartzenberg, advanced to the altar.  When the Emperor had nearly\r\nreached the altar the “Te Deum” commenced.  At the moment of the\r\nbenediction, the sovereigns and persons who accompanied them, as well as\r\nthe twenty-five thousand troops who covered the Place, all knelt down.\r\nThe Greek priest presented the cross to the Emperor Alexander, who kissed\r\nit; his example was followed by the individuals who accompanied him,\r\nthough they were not of the Greek faith.  On rising, the Grand Duke\r\nConstantine took off his hat, and immediately salvoes of artillery were\r\nheard.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe following titles have the signification given below during the period\r\ncovered by this work:\r\n\r\nMONSEIGNEUR...........
