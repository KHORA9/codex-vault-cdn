Dating from\r\nits earliest infancy, until the epoch when it ceased to deserve the\r\ntitle of classical, its existence occupies a period of less than four\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThe imperial city had been founded for upwards of five hundred years\r\nwithout exhibiting more than those rudest germs of literary taste which\r\nare common to the most uncivilized nations, without producing a single\r\nauthor either in poetry or prose.\r\n\r\nThe Roman mind, naturally vigorous and active, was still uncultivated,\r\nwhen, about two centuries and a half before the Christian era,[1]\r\nconquest made the inhabitants of the capital acquainted, for the first\r\ntime, with Greek science, art, and literature; and the last rays of\r\nclassic taste and learning ceased to illumine the Roman world before the\r\naccession of the Antonines.[2]\r\n\r\nSuch a history, however, must be introduced by a reference to times of\r\nmuch higher antiquity. The language itself must be examined\r\nhistorically, that is, its progress and its formation from its primitive\r\nelements, must be traced with reference to the influences exercised upon\r\nit from without by the natives who spoke the dialects out of which it\r\nwas composed; and the earliest indications of a taste for poetry, and a\r\ndesire to cultivate the intellectual powers, must be marked and followed\r\nout in their successive stages of development. In this investigation, it\r\nwill be seen how great the difficulties were with which literary men had\r\nto struggle under the Republic—difficulties principally arising from the\r\nphysical activity of the people, and the practical character of the\r\nRoman mind, which led the majority to undervalue and despise devotion to\r\nsedentary and contemplative pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe Roman, in the olden times, had a high and self-denying sense of\r\nduty—he was ambitious, but his ambition was for the glory, not of\r\nhimself, but his country; he thus lived for conquest: his motive,\r\nhowever, was not self-aggrandizement but the extension of the domination\r\nof Rome. When the state came to be merged in the individual, generals\r\nand statesmen sought to heap up wealth and to acquire power; but it was\r\nnot so in the Republican times. Owing to these characteristic features,\r\nthe Roman citizen conceived it to be his duty to devote his energies to\r\nthe public service: he concentrated all his powers, mental and bodily,\r\nupon war and politics; he despised all other occupations and sources of\r\nfame; for he was conscious that his country owed her position amongst\r\nnations to her military prowess, and her liberties at home to the wise\r\nadministration of her constitution.\r\n\r\nHence it will be seen, that there never was a period in which literature\r\ndid not require to be fostered and protected by the patronage of the\r\nwealthy and powerful. Even tragedy never captivated the feelings or\r\nacquired an influence over the minds of the people at large as it did in\r\nGreece; it degenerated into mere recitations in a dramatic form,\r\naddressed like any other poetry to a _coterie_. Comedy formed the only\r\nexception to this rule. It was the only species of literature which the\r\nmasses thoroughly enjoyed. Learning was a sickly plant: patronage was\r\nthe artificial heat which brought it to maturity. Accius was patronized\r\nby D. Brutus; Ennius by Lucilius and the Scipios; Terence by Africanus\r\nand Lælius; Lucretius by the Memmii; Tibullus by Messala; Propertius by\r\nÆlius Gallus; Virgil and his friends by Augustus, Mæcenas, and Pollio;\r\nMartial and Quintilian by Domitian.\r\n\r\nAs the conquest of Magna Græcia, Sicily, and, finally, of Greece itself,\r\nfirst directed to the pursuit of intellectual cultivation a people whose\r\nnational literature, even if it deserved to be so called, was of the\r\nrudest and most meager description, Roman literature was, as might be\r\nexpected, the offspring of the Greek, and its beauties a reflexion of\r\nthe Greek mind; and although some portions were more original than\r\nothers, as being more congenial to the national character—such, for\r\nexample, as satire, oratory, and history—it was, upon the whole, never\r\nanything more than an imitation. It had, therefore, all the faults of an\r\nimitation. As in painting, those that study the old masters, and neglect\r\nnature, are nothing more than copyists, however high the finish and\r\nelaborate the polish of their works may be; so in the literature of\r\nRome, we are delighted with the execution, and charmed with the genius,\r\nwit, and ingenuity, but we seek in vain for the enthusiasm and\r\ninspiration which breathes in every part of the original.\r\n\r\nOne faculty of the greatest importance to literary eminence was\r\npossessed by the Romans in the highest perfection, because it may be\r\nacquired as well as innate, and is always improved and polished by\r\neducation: that faculty is taste—the ability, as Addison defines it, to\r\ndiscern the beauties of an author with pleasure, and his imperfections\r\nwith dislike.\r\n\r\nOf the three periods into which this history is divided, the first may\r\nbe considered as _dramatic_. Eloquence, indeed, made rapid strides, and\r\nC. Gracchus may be considered as the father of Latin prose; but the\r\nlanguage was not sufficiently smoothed and polished; the sentiments of\r\nthe orator were far superior to the diction in which they were conveyed.\r\nJurisprudence also was studied with thoughtfulness and accuracy;\r\nhistory, however, was nothing more than annals, and epic poetry rugged\r\nand monotonous. But the acting tragedy of the Romans is almost\r\nexclusively confined to this period; and the comedies of Plautus and\r\nTerence were then written, which have survived to command the admiration\r\nof modern times. Although, at this epoch, the language was elaborately\r\npolished and embellished with the utmost variety of graceful forms and\r\nexpressions, it was simple and unconstrained: it flowed easily and\r\nnaturally, and was therefore full and copious; brevity and epigrammatic\r\nterseness are acquired qualities, and the result of art, although that\r\nart may be skilfully concealed.\r\n\r\nThe second period consists of two subdivisions, of which the first was\r\nthe era of _prose_, and, consequently, the period at which the language\r\nattained its greatest perfection; for the structure, power, and genius\r\nof a language must be judged of by its prose, and not by its poetry.\r\nCicero is the representative of this era as an orator and\r\nphilosopher—Cæsar and Sallust as historians. The second subdivision, or\r\nthe Augustan age, is the era of poetry, for in it poetry arrived at the\r\nsame eminence which prose had attained in the preceding generation. But\r\nthe age of Cicero and that of Augustus can only be made subdivisions of\r\none great period; they are not separated from each other by a strong\r\nline of demarkation; they are blended together, and gradually melt into\r\none another. In the former, Lucretius and Catullus were the harbingers\r\nof Virgil, Horace, and Ovid; and, in the latter, the sun of Cicero,\r\nCæsar, and Sallust, seems to set in the sweet narrative of Livy.\r\n\r\nThe last period is _rhetorical_: it has been called “the silver age.” It\r\nproduced Rome’s only fabulist, Phædrus; the greatest satirist, Juvenal;\r\nthe wittiest epigrammatist, Martial; the most philosophical historian,\r\nTacitus; the most judicious critic, Quintilian; and a letter-writer,\r\nscarcely inferior to Cicero himself, the younger Pliny; and yet,\r\nnotwithstanding these illustrious names, this is the period of the\r\ndecline. These great names shed a lustre over their generation; but they\r\ndid not influence their taste or arrest the approaching decay of the\r\nnational genius: causes were at work which were rapidly producing this\r\neffect, and they were beyond their control. A new and false standard of\r\ntaste was now set up, which was inconsistent with original genius and\r\nindependent thought. Rome was persuaded, to accept a declamatory\r\nrhetoric as a substitute for that fervid eloquence in which she had\r\ndelighted, and which was now deprived of its use, and was driven from\r\nthe Forum to the lecture-room. This taste infected every species of\r\ncomposition. Seneca abused his fine talents to teach men to admire\r\nnothing so much as glitter, novelty, and affectation; and, at length,\r\nall became constrained, hollow, and artificial. With the national\r\nliberty, the national intellect lapsed into a state of inactivity: a\r\nperiod of intellectual darkness succeeded, the influence which the\r\ncapital had lost was taken up by the provinces, and thus the way was\r\npaved for the inroad of barbarism.\r\n\r\nSuch is the outline of this work; and if the reader finds some features,\r\nwhich he considers of great importance, rapidly touched upon, the extent\r\nof the subject, and the wish to compress it within a moderate compass,\r\nmust be offered as the author’s apology. In conclusion, the author\r\nacknowledges his deep obligations to those historians and biographers\r\nwhose works he has consulted during the composition of this history. He\r\nfeels that it would have been presumptuous to offer such a work to the\r\npublic without having profited by the laborious investigations of Wolf,\r\nBayle, Hermann, Grotefend, Bernhardy, Bähr, Schlegel, Lachmann, Dunlop,\r\nMatthiæ, Schoell, Krause, Ritter, Nisard, Pierron, Niebuhr, Milman,\r\nArnold, Merivale, Donaldson, Smith, and the authors of the “Biographie\r\nUniverselle.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BOOK I.\r\n\r\n                               FIRST ERA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGE.\r\n\r\n Comparison of the Latin language with the Greek—Eras of\r\n   Latinity—Origin of the Romans—Elements of the Latin\r\n   language—Etruscan influence                                        33\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n The Eugubine Tables—Existence of Oscan in Italy—Bantine\r\n   Table—Perugian Inscription—Etruscan Alphabet and Words—Chant of\r\n   Fratres Arvales—Salian Hymn—Other Monuments of Old Latin—Latin\r\n   and Greek Alphabets compared                                       44\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n Saturnian Metre—Opinions respecting its origin—Early examples of\r\n   this Metre—Saturnian Ballads in Livy—Structure of the\r\n   Verse—Instances of Rhythmical Poetry                               60\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n Three periods of Roman Classical Literature—Its Elements\r\n   rude—Roman Religion—Etruscan influence—Early Historical\r\n   Monuments—Fescennine Verses—Fabulæ Atellanæ—Introduction of\r\n   Stage-Players—Derivation of Satire                                 67\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n Emancipation of Livius Andronicus—His imitation of the\r\n   Odyssey—New kind of Scenic Exhibitions—First exhibition of his\r\n   Dramas—Nævius a Political Partisan—His bitterness—His Punic\r\n   War—His nationality—His versification                              76\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n Nævius stood between two Ages—Life of Ennius—Epitaphs written by\r\n   him—His taste, learning, and character—His fitness for being a\r\n   Literary Reformer—His influence on the language—His\r\n   versification—The Annals—Difficulties of the Subject—Tragedies\r\n   and Comedies—Satire—Minor Works                                    90\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n The New Comedy of the Greeks the Model of the Roman—The Morality\r\n   of Roman Comedy—Want of variety in the Plots of Roman\r\n   Comedy—Dramatis Personæ—Costume—Characters—Music—Latin\r\n   Pronunciation—Metrical Licenses—Criticism of Volcatius—Life of\r\n   Plautus—Character of his Comedies—Analysis of his Plots            99\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n Statius compared with Menander—Criticism of Cicero—Hypotheses\r\n   respecting the early life of Terence—Anecdote related by\r\n   Donatus—Style and Morality of Terence—Anecdote of him related\r\n   by Cornelius Nepos—His pecuniary circumstances and death—Plots\r\n   and Criticism of his Comedies—The remaining Comic Poets           118\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n Why Tragedy did not flourish at Rome—National Legends not\r\n   influential with the People—Fabulæ Prætextatæ—Roman Religion\r\n   not ideal—Roman love for Scenes of Real Action and Gorgeous\r\n   Spectacle—Tragedy not patronised by the People—Pacuvius—His\r\n   Dulorestes and Paulus                                             140\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n L.

But as all of them sprang from one common origin, the great\r\nIndo-European stock to which also the Hellenic family belonged, a\r\nrelation of the most intimate kind is visible between the languages of\r\nancient Greece and Rome. Not only are their alphabets and grammatical\r\nconstructions identical, but the genius of the one is so similar to that\r\nof the other, that the Romans readily adopted the principles of Greek\r\nliterary taste, and Latin, without losing its own characteristic\r\nfeatures, moulded itself after the Greek model.\r\n\r\nLatin, however, has not the plastic property which the Greek\r\npossesses—the natural faculty of transforming itself into every variety\r\nof shape conceived by the fancy and imagination. It is a harder\r\nmaterial, it readily takes a polish, but the process by which it\r\nreceives it is laborious and artificial. Greek, like a liquid or a soft\r\nsubstance, seems to crystallize as it were spontaneously into the most\r\nbeautiful forms: Latin, whether poetry or prose, derives only from\r\nconsummate art and skill that graceful beauty which is the natural\r\nproperty of the kindred language.\r\n\r\nLatin, also, to continue the same metaphor, has other characteristic\r\nfeatures of hard substances—gravity, solidity, and momentum or energy.\r\nIt is a fit language for embodying and expressing the thoughts of an\r\nactive and practical but not an imaginative and speculative people.\r\n\r\nBut the Latin language, notwithstanding its nervous energy and\r\nconstitutional vigour, has, by no means, exhibited the permanency and\r\nvitality of the Greek. The Greek language, reckoning from the earliest\r\nworks extant to the present day, boasts of an existence measured by\r\nnearly one-half the duration of the human race, and yet how gradual were\r\nthe changes during the classical periods, and how small, when compared\r\nwith those of other European languages, the sum and result of them all!\r\nSetting aside the differences due to race and physical organization,\r\nthere are no abrupt chasms, no broad lines of demarkation, between one\r\nliterary period and another. The transition is gentle, slow, and\r\ngradual. The successive steps can be traced and followed out. The\r\nliterary style of one period melts and is absorbed into that of the\r\nfollowing one, just like the successive tints and colours of the prism.\r\nThe Greek of the Homeric poems is not so different from that of\r\nHerodotus and Thucydides, or the tragedians or the orators, or even the\r\nauthors of the later debased ages, but that the same scholar who\r\nunderstands the one can analyze the rest. Though separated by so many\r\nages, the contemporaries of Demosthenes could appreciate the beauties of\r\nHomer; and the Byzantines and early Christian fathers wrote and spoke\r\nthe language of the ancient Greek philosophers.\r\n\r\nThe Greek language long outlived Greek nationality. The earliest Roman\r\nhistorians wrote in Greek because they had as yet no native language\r\nfitter to express their thoughts. The Romans, in the time of Cicero,\r\nmade Greek the foundation of a liberal education, and frequented Athens\r\nas a University for the purpose of studying Greek literature and\r\nphilosophy. The great orator, in his defence of the poet Archias,\r\ninforms us that Greek literature was read by almost all nations of the\r\nworld, whilst Latin was still confined within very narrow boundaries. At\r\nthe commencement of the Christian era Greek was so prevalent throughout\r\nthe civilized world, that it was the language chosen by the Evangelists\r\nfor recording the doctrines of the gospel. In the time of Hadrian, Greek\r\nwas the favourite language of literary men. The Princess Anna Comnena,\r\ndaughter of the Emperor Alexis, and Eustathius, the commentator on\r\nHomer, both of whom nourished in the twelfth century after the birth of\r\nChrist, are celebrated for the singular purity of their style; and,\r\nlastly, Philelphus, who lived in the fifteenth century, and had visited\r\nConstantinople, states, in a letter dated A. D. 1451, that although much\r\nbad Greek was spoken in that capital, the court, and especially the\r\nladies, retained the dignity and elegance which characterize the purest\r\nwriters of the classical ages. “Græci quibus lingua depravata non sit,\r\net quos ipsi tum sequimur tum imitamur ita loquuntur vulgo etiam hac\r\ntempestate ut Aristophanes comicus ut Euripides tragicus, ut oratores\r\nomnes ut historiographi ut philosophi etiam ipsi et Plato et\r\nAristoteles. Viri aulici veterem sermonis dignitatem atque elegantiam\r\nretinebant.”[3]\r\n\r\nSuch was the wonderful vitality of Greek in its ancient form; and yet,\r\nstrange to say, notwithstanding it clung so to existence, it seems as\r\nthough it was a plant of such delicate nature, that it could only\r\nflourish under a combination of favourable circumstances. It pined and\r\nwithered when separated from the living Greek intellect. It lived only\r\nwhere Greeks themselves lived, in their fatherland or in their colonies.\r\nIt refused to take root elsewhere. Whenever in any part of the world a\r\nGreek settlement decayed, and the population became extinct, even\r\nalthough Greek art and science, and literature and philosophy, had found\r\nthere a temporary home, the language perished also.\r\n\r\nThe Greek language could not exist when the fostering care of native\r\ngenius was withdrawn: it then shrunk back again into its original\r\ndimensions, and was confined within the boundaries of its original home.\r\nWhen the Greeks in any place passed away, their language did not\r\ninfluence or amalgamate with that of the people which succeeded them.\r\nLatin, on the other hand, was propagated like the dominion of Rome by\r\nconquest; it either took the place of the language of the conquered\r\nnation, or became engrafted upon it and gradually pervaded its\r\ncomposition. Hence its presence is discernible in all European\r\nlanguages. In Spain it became united with the Celtic and Iberian as\r\nearly as the period of the Gracchi: it was planted in Gaul by the\r\nconquests of Julius Cæsar, and in Britain (so far as the names of\r\nlocalities are concerned) by his transient expeditions; and lastly, in\r\nthe reign of Trajan, it became permanently fixed in the distant regions\r\nof Dacia and Pannonia.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely correct to term Greek a dead language. It has\r\ndegenerated, but has never perished or disappeared. Its harmonious\r\nmodulations are forgotten, and its delicate pronunciation is no longer\r\nheard, but Greek is still spoken at Athens. The language, of course,\r\nexhibits those features which constitute the principal difference\r\nbetween ancient and modern languages; prepositions and particles have\r\nsupplanted affixes and inflexions, auxiliary verbs supply the gaps\r\ncaused by the crumbling away of the old conjugations, and literal\r\ntranslations of modern modes of speech give an air of incongruity and\r\nbarbarism; but still the language is upon the whole wonderfully\r\npreserved. A well-educated modern Greek would find less difficulty in\r\nunderstanding the writings of Xenophon than an Englishman would\r\nexperience in reading Chaucer, or perhaps Spenser.\r\n\r\nGreek has evinced not only vitality, but individuality likewise.\r\nCompared with other languages, its stream flowed pure through barbarous\r\nlands, and was but little tinged or polluted by the soil through which\r\nit passed. There is nothing of this in Latin, neither the vitality nor\r\nthe power of resistance to change. Strange to say, although partially\r\nderived from the same source, its properties appear to be totally\r\ndifferent. Latin seems to have a strong disposition to change; it\r\nreadily became polished, and as readily barbarized; it had no difficulty\r\nin enriching itself with new expressions borrowed from the Greek, and\r\nconforming itself to Greek rules of taste and grammar. When it came in\r\ncontact with the languages of other nations, the affinity which it had\r\nfor them was so strong that it speedily amalgamated with them, but it\r\ndid not so much influence them as itself receive an impress from them.\r\nIt did not supersede, but it became absorbed in and was corrupted by,\r\nother tongues. Probably, as it was originally made up of many European\r\nelements, it recognised a relationship with all other languages, and\r\ntherefore readily admitted of fusion together with them into a composite\r\nform. Its existence is confined within the limits of less than eight\r\ncenturies. It assumed a form adapted for literary composition less than\r\ntwo centuries and a half before the Christian era, and it ceased to be a\r\nspoken language in the sixth century.\r\n\r\nAs long as the Roman empire existed in its integrity, and the capital\r\ncity retained its influence as the patron to whom all literary men must\r\nlook for support, and as the model of refinement and civilization, the\r\nlanguage maintained its dominion. Provincial writers endeavoured to rid\r\nthemselves of their provincialisms. At Rome they formed their taste and\r\nreceived their education. The rule of language was the usage of the\r\ncapital; but when the empire was dismembered, and language was thus set\r\nfree from its former restrictions, each section of it felt itself at\r\nliberty to have an independent language and literature of its own, the\r\nclassical standard was neglected, Latin rapidly became barbarized.\r\nAgain, Latin has interpenetrated or become the nucleus of every language\r\nof civilized Europe; it has shown great facilities of adaptation, but no\r\nindividuality or power to supersede; but the relation which it bears to\r\nthem is totally unlike that which ancient Greek bears to modern. The\r\nbest Latin scholar would not understand Dante or Tasso, nor would a\r\nknowledge of Italian enable one to read Horace and Virgil.\r\n\r\nThe old Roman language, as it existed previous to coming in contact with\r\nGreek influences, has almost entirely perished. It will be shown\r\nhereafter that only a few records of it remain; and the language of\r\nthese fragments is very different from that of the classical period. Nor\r\ndid the old language grow into the new like the Greek of two successive\r\nages by a process of development, but it was remoulded by external and\r\nforeign influences. So different was the old Roman from classical Latin,\r\nthat although the investigations of modern scholars have enabled us to\r\ndecipher the fragments which remain, and to point out the analogies\r\nwhich exist between old and new forms, some of them were with difficulty\r\nintelligible to the cleverest and best educated of the Augustan age. The\r\ntreaty which Rome made with Carthage in the first year of the Republic\r\nwas engraved on brazen tablets, and preserved in the archives of the\r\nCapitol. Polybius had learning enough to translate it into Greek, but he\r\ntells us that the language of it was too archaic for the Romans of his\r\nday.[4]\r\n\r\nA wide gap separates this old Latin from the Latin of Ennius, whose\r\nstyle was formed by Greek taste; another not so wide is interposed\r\nbetween the age of Ennius and that of Plautus and Terence, both of whom\r\nwrote in the language of their adopted city, but confessedly copied\r\nGreek models; and, lastly, Cicero and the Augustan poets mark another\r\nage, to which from the preceding one, the only transition with which we\r\nare acquainted is the style of oratory of Caius Gracchus, which\r\ntradition informs us was free from ancient rudeness, although it had not\r\nacquired the smoothness and polish of Hortensius or Cicero.\r\n\r\nIn order to arrive at the origin of the Latin language it will be\r\nnecessary to trace that of the Romans themselves. In the most distant\r\nages to which tradition extends, the peninsula of Italy appears to have\r\nbeen inhabited by three stocks or tribes of the great Indo-Germanic\r\nfamily. One of these is commonly known by the name of Oscans; another\r\nconsisted of two branches, the Sabellians, or Sabines, and the Umbrians;\r\nthe third were called Sikeli, sometimes Vituli and Itali. What\r\naffinities there were between these and the other Indo-European tribes\r\nout of Italy, or by what route they came from the original cradle of the\r\nhuman race is wrapped in obscurity. Donaldson considers that all the\r\nso-called aboriginal inhabitants of Italy were of the same race as the\r\nLithuanians or old Prussians. The Oscans evidently, from the name which\r\ntradition assigns to them, claimed to be the aboriginal inhabitants. The\r\nname Osci, or Opici, which is a longer form of it, is etymologically\r\nconnected with Ops, the goddess Earth, and consequently their national\r\nappellation is equivalent to the Greek terms αυτοχθονες, or γηγενεις,\r\nthe “children of the soil.” That the Sabellians and Umbrians are\r\nbranches of the same stock is proved by the similarity which has been\r\ndiscovered to exist between the languages spoken by them. The Umbrians\r\nalso claimed great antiquity, for the Greeks are said to have given them\r\ntheir name from ομβρος, rain; implying that they were an antediluvian\r\nrace, and had survived the storms of rain which deluged the world. Pliny\r\nlikewise considers them the most ancient race in Italy.[5]\r\n\r\nThe original settlements of the Umbrians extended over the district\r\nbounded on one side by the Tiber, on the other by the Po. All the\r\ncountry to the south was in the possession of the Oscans, with the\r\nexception of Latium, which was inhabited by the Sikeli. But in process\r\nof time, the Oscans, pressed upon by the Sabellians, invaded the abodes\r\nof this peaceful and rural people, some of whom submitted and\r\namalgamated with their conquerors, the rest were driven across the\r\nnarrow sea into Sicily, and gave the name to that island.[6] These\r\nnative tribes were not left in undisturbed possession of their rich\r\ninheritance. There arrived in the north of Italy that enterprising race,\r\nfamed alike for their warlike spirit and their skill in the arts of\r\npeace, the Pelasgians (or dark Asiatics,) and became the civilizers of\r\nItaly. Historical research has failed to discover what settlements this\r\nwonderful race inhabited immediately previous to their occupation of\r\nEtruria. According to Livy’s account[7] they must have arrived in Italy\r\nby sea, for he asserts that their first settlements were south of the\r\nApennines, that thence they spread northwards, and that the Rhæti were a\r\nportion of them, and spoke their language in a barbarous and corrupt\r\nform. His testimony ought to have some weight, because, as a native of\r\nthe neighbourhood, he probably knew the Rhætian language. Their\r\nimmigration must have taken place more than one thousand years before\r\nChrist,[8] and yet they were far advanced in the arts of civilization\r\nand refinement, and the science of politics and social life. They\r\nenriched their newly-acquired country with commerce, and filled it with\r\nstrongly-fortified and populous cities; their dominion rapidly spread\r\nover the whole of Italy from sea to sea, from the Alps to Vesuvius and\r\nSalerno, and even penetrated into the islands of Elba and Corsica.[9]\r\nHerodotus[10] asserts that they migrated from Lydia; and this tradition\r\nwas adopted by the Romans and by themselves.[11] Dionysius[12] rejects\r\nthis theory on the grounds that there is no similarity between the\r\nLydian and Etruscan language, religion, or institutions, and that\r\nXanthus, a native Lydian historian, makes no mention of this migration.\r\nDoubtless the language is unique, nor can a connexion be traced between\r\nit and any family; but their alphabet is Phœnician, their theology and\r\npolity oriental, their national dress and national symbol, the eagle,\r\nwas Lydian, and a remarkable custom alluded to both by Herodotus[13] and\r\nPlautus[14] was Lydian likewise.\r\n\r\nEntering the territory of the Umbrians, they drove them before them into\r\nthe rugged and mountainous districts, and themselves occupied the rich\r\nand fertile plains. The head-quarters of the invaders was Etruria; the\r\nconquered Umbrians lived amongst them as a subject people, like the\r\nPeloponnesians under their Dorian conquerors, or the Saxons under the\r\nNorman nobility. This portion of the Pelasgians called themselves\r\nRasena, the Greeks spoke of them as Tyrseni, a name evidently connected\r\nwith the Greek τυρρις or τυρσις (Latin, Turris,) and which remarkably\r\nconfirms the assertion of Herodotus, since the only Pelasgians who were\r\nfamed for architecture or tower-building, were those who claimed a\r\nLydian extraction, namely, the Argives and Etruscans.[15] This theory of\r\nthe Pelasgian origin of the Etruscans is due to Lepsius,[16] and has\r\nbeen adopted by Donaldson;[17] and if it be correct, the language of\r\nEtruria was probably Pelasgian amalgamated with, and to a certain extent\r\ncorrupted by, the native Umbrian.\r\n\r\nPelasgian supremacy on the left bank of the Tiber found no one to\r\ndispute it. Let us now turn our attention to the influence of these\r\ninvaders in lower Italy. As they marched southwards, they vanquished the\r\nOscans and occupied the plains of Latium. They did not, however, remain\r\nlong at peace in the districts which they had conquered. The old\r\ninhabitants returned from the neighbouring highlands to which they had\r\nbeen driven, and subjugated the northern part of Latium.\r\n\r\nThe history of the occupation of Etruria, which has been already\r\nrelated, was here acted over again, with only the following alteration,\r\nthat here the Oscan was the dominant tribe, and the subject people\r\namongst whom they took up their abode were Pelasgians and Sikeli, by\r\nwhom the rest of the low country of Latium were still occupied. The\r\ntowns of the north formed a federal union, of which Alba was the\r\ncapital, whilst of the southern or Pelasgian confederacy the chief city\r\nwas Lavinium, or Latinium. The conquering Oscans were a nation of\r\nwarriors and hunters, and consequently, as Niebuhr remarked, in the\r\nlanguage of this district the terms belonging to war and hunting are\r\nOscan, whilst those which relate to peace and the occupations of rural\r\nlife are Pelasgian. As, therefore, the language of Etruria was\r\nPelasgian, corrupted by Umbrian, so Pelasgian + Oscan is the formula\r\nwhich presents the language of Latium.\r\n\r\nBut the Roman or Latin language is still more composite in its nature,\r\nand consists of more than these two elements. This phenomenon is also to\r\nbe accounted for by the origin of the Roman people. The septi-montium\r\nupon which old Rome was built was occupied by different Italian tribes.\r\nA Latin tribe belonging, if we may trust the mythical tradition, to the\r\nAlban confederacy, had their settlement upon the Mount Palatine, and a\r\nSabine or Sabellian community occupied the neighbouring heights of the\r\nQuirinal and Capitoline. Mutual jealousy of race kept them for some time\r\nseparate from each other; but at length the privilege of intermarriage\r\nwas conceded, and the two communities became one people.\r\n\r\nThe Tyrrhene Pelasgians, however, separated only by a small river from\r\nthis new state, rapidly rising to power and prosperity, were not likely\r\nto view its existence without distrust and jealousy. Accordingly, the\r\nearly Roman historical traditions evidently point to a period during\r\nwhich Rome was subject to Etruscan rule. When the Etruscan dynasty\r\npassed away, its influence in many respects still remained. The religion\r\nand mythology of Etruria left an indelible stamp on the rites and\r\nceremonies of the Roman people. The Etruscan deities were the natural\r\ngods of Rome before the influence of Greek poetry introduced the\r\nmythology of Homer and Hesiod into her Pantheon. The characters and\r\nattributes of these deities were totally different from those of Greece.\r\nNo licentious orgies disgraced their worship; they were defiled by none\r\nof their vices.[18] Saturn, Janus, Sylvanus, Faunus, and other Etruscan\r\ndeities, were grave, venerable, pure, and delighted in the simple\r\noccupations of rural life. It was only general features of resemblance\r\nwhich enabled the poets in later ages to identify Saturn with Kronos,\r\nSylvanus with Pan, the prophetic Camenæ of the Janiculum with the muses\r\nof Parnassus.[19] The point, however, most important for the present\r\nconsideration is that their language was likewise permanently affected.\r\n\r\nThe ethnical affinities which have been here briefly stated, and which\r\nmay be considered as satisfactorily established by the investigations of\r\nNiebuhr, Müller, Lepsius, Donaldson, and others, are a guide to the\r\naffinities of the Latin language, and point out the elements of which it\r\nis composed. These elements, then, are Umbrian, Oscan, Etruscan, Sabine,\r\nand Pelasgian; but, as has been stated, the Etruscan language was a\r\ncompound of Oscan and Pelasgian, and the Sabine was the link between the\r\nUmbrian and Oscan, therefore the elements of the Latin are reduced to\r\nthree, namely, Umbrian, Oscan and Pelasgian. These may again be\r\nclassified under two heads, the one which has, the other which has not,\r\na resemblance to the Greek. All Latin words which resemble Greek are\r\nPelasgian,[20] all which do not are Oscan and Umbrian. From the first of\r\nthese classes must of course be excepted those words—such, for example,\r\nas Triclinium, &c.,—which are directly derived from the Greek, the\r\norigin of which dates partly from the time when Rome began to have\r\nintercourse with the Greek colonies of Magna Græcia, partly since Greek\r\nexercised an influence on Roman literature. It is clear from the\r\ntestimony of Horace that the enriching of the language by the adoption\r\nof such foreign words was defended and encouraged by the literary men of\r\nthe Augustan age:—\r\n\r\n             —— Si forte necesse est\r\n     Indiciis monstrare recentibus abdita rerum\r\n     Fingere cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis\r\n     Continget; dabiturque licentia sumta pudenter,\r\n     Et nova fictaque nuper habebunt verba fidem, si\r\n     Græco fonte cadant, parce detorta.\r\n                                            _Hor. Ep. ad Pis. 48._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n THE EUGUBINE TABLES—EXISTENCE OF OSCAN IN ITALY—BANTINE TABLE—PERUGIAN\r\nINSCRIPTION—ETRUSCAN ALPHABET AND WORDS—CHANT OF FRATRES ARVALES—SALIAN\r\n HYMN—OTHER MONUMENTS OF OLD LATIN—LATIN AND GREEK ALPHABETS COMPARED.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE UMBRIAN LANGUAGE.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Ugubio,[21] at the foot of the Apennines (the\r\nancient Iguvium,) were discovered, in A. D. 1444, seven tables, commonly\r\ncalled the Eugubine Tables. They were in good preservation, and\r\ncontained prayers and rules for religious ceremonies. Some of them were\r\nengraved in the Etruscan or Umbrian characters, others in Latin letters.\r\nLepsius[22] has determined, from philological considerations, that the\r\ndate of them must be as early as from A. U. C. 400,[23] and that the\r\nletters were engraved about two centuries later. A comparison of the two\r\nshows, in the Umbrian character, the letter _s_ standing in the place\r\noccupied by _r_ in the Latin, and _k_ in the place of _g_, because the\r\nEtruscan alphabet, with which the Umbrian is the same, did not contain\r\nthe medial letters _B_, _G_, _D_. An analogous substitute is seen in the\r\ntransition from the old to the more modern Latin. The names Furius and\r\nCaius, for example, were originally written Fusius and Gaius. _H_ is\r\nalso introduced between two vowels, as stahito for stato, in the same\r\nway that in Latin aheneus is derived from _aes_. It also appears that\r\nthe termination of the masculine singular was _o_: thus, orto = ortus;\r\nwhilst that of the plural was or; _e. g._, subator = subacti; screhitor\r\n= scripti. This mode of inflexion illustrates the form amaminor for\r\namamini, which was itself a participle used for amamini estis, an idiom\r\nanalogous to the Greek τετυμμενοι εισι.\r\n\r\nThe following extract, with the translation by Donaldson,[24] together\r\nwith a few words which present the greatest resemblance to the Latin,\r\nwill suffice to give a general notion of the relation which the Umbrian\r\nbears to it:—\r\n\r\nTeio subokau suboko, Dei Grabovi, okriper Fisiu, totaper Jiovina, erer\r\nnomne-per, erar, nomne-per; fos sei, paker sei, okre Fisei, Tote\r\nJiovine, erer nomne, erar nomne: Tab.

Although its\r\nliterature has entirely perished, inscriptions fortunately still\r\nsurvive; but as they must have been engraved long subsequently to the\r\nsettlement of the Sabellians in Southern Italy, the language in which\r\nthey are written must necessarily be compounded of those spoken both by\r\nthe conquerors and the conquered. Although Livy[26] makes mention of an\r\nOscan dramatic literature, for he tells us that the “Fabulæ Atellanæ” of\r\nthe Oscans were introduced when a pestilence raged at Rome,[27] together\r\nwith other theatrical entertainments, he only speaks of the Oscan\r\nlanguage in one passage.[28] This, however, is an important one, because\r\nit proves that Oscan was the vernacular tongue of the Samnites at that\r\nperiod. He relates that Volumnius sent spies into the Samnite camp who\r\nunderstood Oscan: “Gnaros Oscæ linguæ exploratum quid agatur mittit.”\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the reason why the Oscan language prevailed amongst\r\nthis people is, that the dominant orders in Samnium were Sabines. But\r\nthere is evidence of the existence of Oscan in Italy at a still later\r\nperiod. Niebuhr[29] asserts that in the Social War[30] the Marsi spoke\r\nOscan, although in writing they used the Latin characters. Some denarii\r\nstill exist struck by the confederate Italian Government established in\r\nthat war at Corfinium, on which the word _Italia_ is inscribed, whilst\r\nothers bear the word Viteliu. The latter is the old Oscan orthography,\r\nthe former the Latin. One class of these coins, therefore, was struck\r\nfor the use of the Sabine, the other of the Marsian allies. It is said\r\nalso that Oscan was spoken even after the establishment of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe principal monument of the Sabello-Oscan is a brass plate which was\r\ndiscovered A. D. 1793. As the word _Bansæ_ occurs in the 23d line of the\r\ninscription, it has been supposed to refer to the town of Bantia, which\r\nwas situated not far from the spot where the tablet was found, and it is\r\ntherefore called the Bantine Table. In consequence of the perfect state\r\nof the central portion, much of this inscription has been interpreted\r\nwith tolerable certainty and correctness. The affinity may be traced\r\nbetween most of the words and their corresponding Latin; and it is\r\nperfectly clear that the variations from the Latin follow certain\r\ndefinite rules, and that the grammatical inflexions were the same as in\r\nthe oldest Latin. A copy of the Table may be found in the collection of\r\nOrellius, and also in Donaldson’s “Varronianus.”[31] The following are a\r\nfew specimens of words in which a resemblance to the Latin will be\r\nreadily recognised, and also, in some instances, the relation of the\r\nOscan to the other ancient languages of Italy:—\r\n\r\n            Licitud                 Liceto\r\n            Multam                  Mulctam,\r\n            Maimas                  Maximas,\r\n            Carneis                 Carnes\r\n            Senateis                Senatus\r\n            Pis                     quis\r\n            Hipid                   habeat\r\n            Pruhipid                præhibeat\r\n            Pruhipust               præhibuent\r\n            Censtur                 censor\r\n            Censazet                censapit\r\n            Censaum, &c.            censum, &c.\r\n            Comonei                 Communis\r\n            Perum dolum mallom siom Per dolum malum suum\r\n            Iok—Ionc                hoc—hunc\r\n            Pod                     quod\r\n            Valæmon                 Valetudinem\r\n            Fust                    fuerit\r\n            Poizad                  penset (Anglicè, poize.)\r\n            Fuid                    fuit\r\n            Tarpinius               Tarquinius\r\n            Ampus                   Ancus\r\n\r\nTo these other well-known words may be added, which all philologers\r\nallow to be originally Oscan, but which have been incorporated with the\r\nLatin—such as, for example, Brutus, Cascus, Catus, Fœdus, Idus, Porcus,\r\nTrabea; and names of deities, such as Fides, Terminus, Vertumnus, Fors,\r\nFlora, Lares, Mamers, Quirinus, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE ETRUSCAN LANGUAGE.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty and obscurity in which the Etruscan language is involved\r\nare owing to the nature of the inscriptions and monuments which have\r\nbeen discovered. Those records, to which reference has already been made\r\nwhen speaking of the Umbrian and Sabello-Oscan, were of a ceremonial or\r\nlegal character; they therefore contained connected phrases and\r\nsentences, varied modes of thought and expression. Monuments such as the\r\nEugubine or Bantine Tables contribute not a little towards a vocabulary\r\nof the languages, and still more to a knowledge of their structure and\r\nanalogies. This, however, is not the case with the Etruscan monuments of\r\nantiquity which have been hitherto discovered. They are, indeed,\r\nnumerous, but they exhibit little variety. They are sepulchral records\r\nof a complimentary kind, or titles inscribed on statues and votive\r\nofferings. Hence the same brief phraseology continually recurs, and the\r\nprincipal portions of the inscriptions are occupied by proper names.\r\n\r\nThe most important, because the largest, Etruscan record which has been\r\nhitherto discovered, is one which was found near Perugia, A. D.\r\n1822.[32] This inscription contains one hundred and thirty-one words and\r\nabbreviations of words, and of these no fewer than thirty-eight are\r\nproper names. Of the rest, a vast number are either frequently repeated,\r\nor are etymologically connected. These have not proved sufficient to\r\nenable any philologist (although many have attempted it) to give a\r\nsatisfactory and trustworthy explanation of its contents.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the Perugian with the Eugubine inscription shows the\r\nexistence of similarity between some of the words found in both of them;\r\nand this is exactly what we should _à priori_ expect to result from the\r\ntheory of the Etruscan being a compound of the Pelasgian and Umbrian. In\r\nthe Perugian inscription, words which resemble the Umbrian forms are\r\nmore numerous than those which seem to have an affinity for the\r\nPelasgian. Indeed, the language in which it is written appears almost\r\nentirely to have lost the Pelasgian element. The same observation may be\r\nmade with respect to the Cortonian inscription:[33]—\r\n\r\n  Arses verses Sethlanl tephral ape termnu pisest estu; _i. e._ Avertas\r\n  ignem Vulcane victimarum carne post terminum piatus esto; Avertas\r\n  ignem Vulcane in cinerem redigens qui apud terminum piatus esto.\r\n\r\nProbably, therefore, both these belong to a period at which the old\r\nUmbrian of the conquered tribes had been exercising a long-continued\r\ninfluence in corrupting the pure Pelasgian of the conquerors.\r\n\r\nOne example of the Etruscan alphabet is extant. It was discovered in a\r\ntomb at Bomarzo, by Mr. Dennis,[34] inscribed round the foot of a cup,\r\nand probably had been a present for a child. The letters ran from left\r\nto right, and are as follows:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ph ch th u t s r s p n m l i th h z v e c a]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this specimen that the Etruscan language was\r\ndeficient in the letters Β Γ Δ Ξ Ψ Η Ο Ω.\r\n\r\nThe following is a catalogue of those Etruscan words which have been\r\nhanded down to us, together with their Latin interpretation. The list is\r\nbut a meager one, but valuable as containing some which have been\r\nadmitted into the Latin, and as exhibiting many affinities to the\r\nPelasgian:—\r\n\r\n Æsar                                 Deus\r\n Agalletor                            Puer\r\n Andar                                Boreas\r\n Anhelos                              Aurora\r\n Antar                                Aquila\r\n Aracos                               Accipiter\r\n Arimos                               Simia\r\n Arse Verse                           Averte ignem\r\n Ataison                              Vitis\r\n Burros                               Poculum\r\n Balteus                            }\r\n Capra                              } The same as in the Latin.\r\n Cassis                             }\r\n Celer                              }\r\n Capys                                Falco\r\n Damnus                               Equus\r\n Drouna                               Principium\r\n Falandum                             Cœlum\r\n Gapos                                Currus\r\n Hister                               Ludio\r\n Iduare                               Dividere\r\n Idulus                               Ovis\r\n Itus                                 Idus\r\n Læna                                 Vestimentum\r\n Lanista                              Carnifex\r\n Lar                                  Dominus\r\n Lucumo                               Princeps\r\n Mantisa                              Additamentum\r\n Nanos                                Vagabundus\r\n Nepos                                Luxuriosus\r\n Rasena                               Etrusci\r\n Subulo                               Tibicen\r\n Slan                                 Filius\r\n Sec                                  Filia\r\n Ril avil                             Vixit annos\r\n Toga                                 Toga\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of General Galassi and Mr. Dennis at the Etruscan city\r\nof Cervetri have shown to what an extent the Pelasgian element prevailed\r\nin the old Etruscan. Cervetri was the old Cære or Agylla, which was\r\nfounded by Pelasgians, maintained a religious connexion with the Greeks\r\nas a kindred race,[36] and remained Pelasgian to a late period.[37] In\r\nthe royal tomb discovered in this place the name of Tarquin—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tarquin]\r\n\r\noccurs no less than thirty-five times.[38] On a little cruet-shaped\r\nvase, like an ink-bottle, was found inscribed the syllables Bi, Ba, Bu,\r\n&c., as in a horn-book, and also an alphabet in the Pelasgian\r\ncharacter.[39] These characters are almost identical with the Etruscan.\r\nAgain, General Galassi found here a small black pot, with letters\r\nlegibly scratched, and filled with red paint.[40] Lepsius pronounced\r\nthem to be Pelasgian, divided them into words, and arranged them in the\r\nfollowing lines, which are evidently hexametrical:—\r\n\r\n            Mi ni kethu ma mi mathu maram lisiai thipurenai\r\n            Ethe erai sic epana mi nethu nastav helephu.\r\n\r\nMr. Donaldson[41] has offered some suggestions, with a view to\r\nexplaining this inscription, and has clearly shown many close affinities\r\nto the Greek; but there is another which he quotes, and which is\r\npronounced by Müller[42] to be pure Pelasgian, which even in its\r\nPelasgian form is almost Greek:—\r\n\r\n                          Mi kalairu fuius.\r\n                          ἐιμι Καλαιροῦ Ϝυιός.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible in this work to attempt the analysis of all the\r\nknown Etruscan words, and to point out their affinities to the\r\nPelasgian, the Greek, or the Latin; but a few examples may be given,\r\nwhilst the reader, who wishes to pursue the subject further, is referred\r\nto the investigations of the learned author of the “Varronianus.”\r\n\r\nAifil, age, is evidently from the same root as the Greek αἰων, the\r\ndigamma, which is the characteristic of the Pelasgian, as it was of the\r\nderivative dialect, the Æolic, being inserted between the vowels. Aruns,\r\nan agriculturist, contains the root of ἀρόω, to plough. Capys, a falcon,\r\nthat of capio, to catch. Cassis (originally capsis,) that of caput, the\r\nhead. Lituus, a curved staff, that of obliquus. Toga, that of tego, the\r\ndress, which was originally as much the Etruscan costume as it\r\nsubsequently became characteristic of the Roman. Lastly, it is well\r\nknown that, whereas the Greeks denoted numbers by the letters of the\r\nalphabet, the Romans had a system of numeral signs. This was a great\r\nimprovement. The Greek system of notation was clumsy, because in reality\r\nit only pointed out the order in which each number stands. The Roman\r\nnotation, on the other hand, represented arithmetical quantity, and even\r\nthe addition and subtraction of quantities; and this elegant contrivance\r\nthe Romans owed to the Etruscans. Their numerals were as follows:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis system is identical with the Roman, for Ʌ inverted became Ⅴ, and\r\n[50 symbol], [100 symbol], [500 symbol], and [1000 symbol] became\r\nrespectively Ⅼ, Ⅽ, Ⅾ, and ⅭⅠↃ, for which Ⅿ was substituted in later\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nFrom the few examples which have been here given, it is evident that the\r\nPelasgian element of the Etruscan was most influential in the formation\r\nof the Latin language, as the Pelasgian art and science of that\r\nwonderful people contributed to the advancement and improvement of the\r\nRoman character.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE OLD LATIN LANGUAGE.\r\n\r\nThe above observations, and the materials out of which the old Latin was\r\ncomposed, have prepared the way for some illustrations of its structure\r\nand character. The monuments from which all our information is derived\r\nare few in number: the conflagration of Rome destroyed the majority; the\r\ncommon accidents of a long series of years completed the mischief.\r\nAlmost the only records which remain are laws, ceremonials, epitaphs,\r\nand honorary inscriptions.\r\n\r\nAn example of the oldest Latin extant is contained in the sacred chant\r\nof the Fratres Arvales. The inscription which embodied this Litany was\r\ndiscovered A. D. 1778,[43] whilst digging out the foundations of the\r\nsacristy of St. Peter’s at Rome. The monument belongs to the reign of\r\nHeliogabalus;[44] but although the date is so recent, the permanence of\r\nreligious formulæ renders it probable that the inscription contains the\r\nexact words sung by this priesthood in the earliest times.\r\n\r\nThe Fratres Arvales were a college of priests, founded, according to the\r\ntradition, by Romulus himself. The symbolical ensign of their office was\r\na chaplet of ears of corn (spicea corona,) and their function was to\r\noffer prayers in solemn dances and processions at the opening of spring\r\nfor plenteous harvests. Their song was chanted in the temple with closed\r\ndoors, accompanied by that peculiar dance which was termed the\r\ntripudium, from its containing three beats. To this rhythm the Saturnian\r\nmeasure of the hymn corresponds; and for this reason each verse was\r\nthrice repeated. The hymn contains sixteen letters: _s_ is sometimes put\r\nfor _r_, _ei_ for _i_, and _p_ for _f_ or _ph_. The following is a\r\ntranscription of it, as given by Orellius, to which an interpretation is\r\nsubjoined:—\r\n\r\n  Enos     Lases      juvate.\r\n\r\n  Nos      Lares      juvate.\r\n\r\n  Us       O Lares    help.\r\n\r\n  Neve     luaerve    Marmer sins  incurrere in pleoris.\r\n\r\n  Neve     luem       Mars   sinas incurrere    plus.\r\n\r\n  Nor the pestilence O Mars permit to invade    more.\r\n\r\n  Satur    fufere     Mars  limen       Salista     berber.\r\n\r\n  Satiatus furendo    Mars  lumen       Solis sta   fervere.\r\n\r\n  Satiated with fury, O Mars, the light of the sun stop from burning.\r\n\r\n  Semunis     alternei       advocapit     conctos.\r\n\r\n  Semihemones alterni        ad vos capite cunctos.\r\n\r\n  Us half-men in your turns to you take all.\r\n\r\n  Enos Marmer juvato.\r\n\r\n  Nos  Mars   juvato.\r\n\r\n  Us   Mars   help.\r\n\r\n  Triumpe, triumpe, triumpe, triumpe, triumpe.\r\n\r\n  Triumph, &c.\r\n\r\nOf the Salian hymn (Carmen Saliare,) another monument of ancient Latin,\r\nthe following fragments, preserved by Varro,[45] are all that remain,\r\nwith the exception of a few isolated words:—\r\n\r\n         (1.) Cozeulodoizesa, omina vero ad patula coemisse\r\n              Jam cusiones; duonus ceruses dunzianus vevet.[45]\r\n\r\nThis has been corrected, arranged in the Saturnian metre, and translated\r\ninto Latin by Donaldson,[46] as follows:—\r\n\r\n                Choroi-aulōdos eso, omina enim vero\r\n                Ad patula’ ose misse Jani cariones.\r\n                Duonus Cerus esit dunque Janus vevet.\r\n\r\n      Choroio-aulodus ero, omina enim vero ad patulas aures\r\n      Miserunt Jani curiones. Bonus Cerus erit donec Janus vivet.\r\n\r\n      I will be a flute-player in the chorus, for the priests of Janus\r\n      have sent omens to open ears. Cerus (the Creator) will be\r\n      propitious so long as Janus shall live.\r\n\r\n      (2.) Divum empta cante, divum deo supplicante.\r\n\r\n      _i. e._ Deorum impetu canite, deorum deo suppliciter canite.\r\n\r\n        Sing by the inspiration of the gods, sing as suppliants to the\r\n        god of gods.\r\n\r\nThe _Leges Regiæ_ are generally considered as furnishing the next\r\nexamples, in point of antiquity, of the old Latin language; but there\r\ncan be little doubt that, although they were assumed by the metrical\r\ntraditions to belong to the period of the kings,[47] they belong to a\r\nlater historical period than the laws of the Twelve Tables. Some\r\nfragments of laws, attributed to Numa and Servius Tullius, are preserved\r\nby Festus[48] in a restored and corrected form, and, therefore, it is to\r\nbe feared that they have been modernized in accordance with the\r\northographical rules of a later age.\r\n\r\nOne of these laws is quoted by Livy[49] as put in force in the trial of\r\nthe surviving Horatius for the murder of his sister when he returned, as\r\nthe tradition relates, from his victory over the Curatii. Another is\r\nalluded to by Pliny,[50] which forbids the sacrificing all fish which\r\nhave not scales; but they are given in modern Latin, and can only be\r\nrestored to their old form by conjecture.\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, proceed at once to a consideration of the Latin of\r\nthe Twelve Tables, of which fragments have been preserved by Cicero,\r\nAulus Gellius, Festus, Gaius, Ulpian, and others. These fragments are to\r\nbe found collected together in Haubold’s “Institutionum Juris Romani\r\nprivati lineamenta” and Donaldson’s “Varronianus.”[51] The laws of the\r\nTwelve Tables were engraven on tablets of brass, and publicly set up in\r\nthe Comitium, and were first made public in B. C. 449.[52] Nor had the\r\nRomans any other digested code of laws until the time of Justinian.[53]\r\nThe following are a few examples of the words and phrases contained in\r\nthem:—\r\n\r\n                       Ni             nec\r\n                       Em             eum\r\n                       Endo jacito    injicito\r\n                       Ævitas         ætas\r\n                       Fuat           sit\r\n                       Sonticus       nocens\r\n                       Hostis         Hospes\r\n                       Diffensus esto differatur\r\n                       Se             sine\r\n                       Venom-dint     venum det\r\n                       Estod          esto\r\n                       Escit          est\r\n                       Legassit, &c.  legaverit.\r\n\r\nThe next example of the old Latin is contained in the Tiburtine\r\ninscription, which was discovered in the sixteenth century at Tivoli,\r\nthe ancient Tibur. It came into the possession of the Barberini family;\r\nbut it was afterwards lost, and has never been recovered. Niebuhr[54]\r\nconsiders (and his conjecture is probably correct) that this monument is\r\na Senatus-consultum, belonging to the period of the second Samnite\r\nwar.[55] The inscription is given at length in the collection of\r\nGruter,[56] and also by Niebuhr[57] and Donaldson.[58] The Latin in\r\nwhich it is written may be considered almost classical, the variations\r\nfrom that of a later age being principally orthographical. For example:—\r\n\r\n                 Tiburtes         is written Teiburtes\r\n                 Castoris         is written Kastorus\r\n                 Advertit         is written advortit\r\n                 Dixistis         is written deixsistis\r\n                 Publicæ          is written poplicæ\r\n                 Utile            is written oitile\r\n                 Inducimus        is written indoucimus\r\n                 A or ab before v is written af.\r\n\r\nThis document is followed very closely, in point of time, by the\r\nwell-known inscription on the sarcophagus of L. Cornelius Scipio[59]\r\nBarbatus, and the epitaph on his son,[60] which are both written in the\r\nold Saturnian metre. Scipio Barbatus was the great-grandfather of the\r\nconqueror of Hannibal, and was consul in A. U. C. 456, the first year of\r\nthe third Samnite war. His sarcophagus was found A. D. 1780 in a tomb\r\nnear the Appian Way, whence it was removed to the Vatican. The epitaph\r\nis as follows:—\r\n\r\n               Cornelius Lucius Scipio Barbatus Gnaivod\r\n               Patre prognatus fortis vir sapiensque\r\n               Quoius forma virtutei parisuma fuit\r\n               Consol Censor Aidilis quei fuit apud vos\r\n               Taurasia Cisauna Samnio cepit\r\n               Subigit omne Loucana opsidesque abdoucit.\r\n\r\n“Cornelius L. Scipio Barbatus, son of Cnæus, a brave and wise man, whose\r\nbeauty was equal to his virtue. He was amongst you Consul, Censor,\r\nÆdile. He took Taurasia, Cisauna, and Samnium; he subjugated all\r\nLucania, and led away hostages.”\r\n\r\nHis son was Consul A. U. C. 495.[61] The following inscription is on a\r\nslab which was found near the Porta Capona. The title is painted red\r\n(rubricatus:)—\r\n\r\n           L. Cornelio L. F. Scipio, Aidiles, Consol, Censor.\r\n           Honc oino ploirume cosentiunt R.\r\n           Duonoro optimo fuise viro\r\n           Luciom Scipionem. Filios Barbati\r\n           Consol Censor Aidiles hic fuet\r\n           Hic cepit Corsica Aleria que urbe\r\n           Dedet tempestatebus aide mereto.\r\n\r\n“Romans for the most part agree, that this one man, Lucius Scipio, was\r\nthe best of good men. He was the son of Barbatus, Consul, Censor, Ædile.\r\nHe took Corsica and the city Aleria. He dedicated a temple to the Storms\r\nas a just return.”\r\n\r\nIt is not a little remarkable that the style of this epitaph is more\r\narchaic than that of the preceding.\r\n\r\nThe consul of the year B. C. 260 was C. Duilius, who in that year gained\r\nhis celebrated naval victory over the Carthaginians; the inscription,\r\ntherefore, engraved on the pedestal of the Columna Rostrata, which was\r\nerected in commemoration of that event, may be considered as a\r\ncontemporary monument of the language.[62] Some alterations were\r\nprobably made in its orthography at a period subsequent to its erection,\r\nfor it was rent asunder from top to bottom by lightning A. U. C.\r\n580,[63] and is supposed not to have been repaired until the reign of\r\nAugustus, for the restoration of a temple built by Duilius was begun by\r\nthat emperor and completed by Tiberius.[64] The principal peculiarities\r\nto be observed in this inscription are, that the ablatives singular end\r\nin _d_, as in the words Siceliad, obsidioned; _c_ is put for _g_, as in\r\n_macistratos_, _leciones_; _e_ for _i_, as in _navebos_, _ornavet_; _o_\r\nfor _u_, as in _Duilios_, _aurom_; _classes_, _nummi_, &c., are spelt\r\nclases, numei, and _quinqueremos_, _triremos_, _quinresmos_, _triesmos_.\r\nThis monument was discovered A. D. 1565, in a very imperfect state, but\r\nits numerous _lacunæ_ were supplied by Grotefend.\r\n\r\nAbout sixty years after the date of this epitaph,[65] the\r\nSenatus-consultum, respecting the Bacchanals, was passed.[66] This\r\nmonument was discovered A. D. 1692, in the Calabrian village of Terra di\r\nFeriolo, and is now preserved in the Imperial Museum of Vienna.[67]\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any difference between the Latinity of this\r\ninscription and that of the classical period except in the orthography\r\nand some of the grammatical inflexions. The expressions are in\r\naccordance with the usage of good authors, and the construction is not\r\nwithout elegance. Nor is this to be wondered at when it is remembered\r\nthat, at the period when this decree was published, Rome already\r\npossessed a written literature. Ennius was now known as a poet and an\r\nhistorian, and many of the comedies of Plautus had been acted on the\r\npublic stage.\r\n\r\nHaving thus enumerated the existing monuments of the old Roman language\r\nand its constituent elements, it remains to compare the Latin and Greek\r\nalphabets, for the purpose of exhibiting the variations which the Latin\r\nletters have severally undergone.\r\n\r\nThe letters then may be arranged according to the following\r\nclassification:—\r\n\r\n                              { Soft      P       C K or Q,   T.\r\n                  { Mutes     { Medial    B       G           D.\r\n       Consonants {           { Aspirates F (V)   H           —\r\n                  { Liquids               L, M, N, R.\r\n                  { Sibilants             S, X.\r\n       Vowels                             A, E, I, O, U.\r\n\r\nOwing to the relation which subsists between P, B, and F or V, as the\r\nsoft medial and aspirated pronunciation of the same letters, P and B, as\r\nwell as F and V, in Latin, are the representatives or equivalents of the\r\nGreek F sound (φ and Ϝ,) and V also sometimes stands in the place of β.\r\nFor example (1,) the Latin _fama_, _fero_, _fugio_, _vir_, &c.,\r\ncorrespond to the Greek φημή, φέρω, φεύγω (Ϝ)Ἄρης. (2.) _Nebula_,\r\n_caput_, _albus_, _ambo_, to νεφέλη, κεφαλή, ἀλφός, ἄμφω. Similarly,\r\n_duonus_ and _duellum_ become _bonus_ and _bellum_; the transition being\r\nfrom _du_ to a sound like the English _w_, thence to _v_, and lastly to\r\n_b_. The old Latin _c_ was used as the representative of its\r\ncorresponding medial G, as well as K; for example, magistratus,\r\nlegiones, Carthaginienses were written on the Columna Rostrata,\r\n_leciones_, _macistratus_, _Cartacinienses_. The representative of the\r\nGreek κ was c; thus caput stands for κεφαλή: the sound _qu_ also, as\r\nmight be expected, from its answering to the Greek koppa (Q,) and the\r\nHebrew koph (‏ק‎,) had undoubtedly in the old Latin the same sound as C\r\nor K, and, therefore, quatio becomes, in composition, cutio; and quojus,\r\nquoi, quolonia, become, in classical Latin, _cujus_, _cui_, _colonia_.\r\nThis pronunciation has descended to the modern French language, although\r\nit has become lost in the Italian. A passage from the “Aulularia”[68] of\r\nPlautus illustrates this assertion, and Quintilian[69] also bears\r\ntestimony to the existence of the same pronunciation in the time of\r\nCicero.\r\n\r\nThe aspirate H is in Latin the representative of the Greek Χ, as, for\r\nexample, _hiems_, _hortus_, and _humi_ correspond to χείμων, χόρτος,\r\nχάμαι, whilst the third Greek aspirated mute Θ becomes a tenuis in the\r\nmouths of the early Latins, as in _Cartaginienses_, and the _h_ sound\r\nwas afterwards restored when Greek exercised an influence over the\r\nlanguage as well as the literature of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the _th_ sound in the old Latin is compensated for in a\r\nvariety of ways; sometimes by an _f_, as fera, fores, for θήρ and θύρα.\r\n\r\nThe interchanges which take place between the T and D, and the liquids\r\nL, N, R, can be accounted for on the grammatical principle,[70] which is\r\nso constantly exemplified in the literal changes of the Semitic\r\nlanguages, that letters articulated by the same organ are frequently put\r\none for the other. Now D, T, L, N are all palatals, and in the\r\npronunciation of R also some use is made of the palate. Hence we find a\r\ncommutation of _r_ and _n_ in δωρον, _donum_; _æreus_, _æneus_; of _t_\r\nand _l_ in θώρηξ and _lorica_; _d_ and _l_ in olfacio and odere facio,\r\nUlysses and Οδυσσεύς; _r_ and _d_ in _auris_ and _audio_, _arfuise_, and\r\n_adfuisse_.\r\n\r\nTo the remaining liquid, _m_, little value seems to have been attached\r\nin Latin. In verse it was elided before a vowel; in verbs it was\r\nuniversally omitted from the first person of the present tense, although\r\nit was originally its characteristic, and was only retained in _sum_ and\r\n_inquam_: it was also omitted in other words, as _omne_ for _omnem_;[71]\r\nand Cato the Censor was in the habit of putting _dice_ and _facie_ for\r\n_dicam_(or _dicem_) and _faciam_ (_faciem_.)\r\n\r\nAs the Roman _x_ was nothing more than a double letter compounded of _g_\r\nor _c_ and _s_, as _rego_, _regsi_, _rexi_; _dico_, _dicsi_, _dixi_, the\r\nonly consonant now remaining for consideration is the sibilant _s_. The\r\nprincipal position which it occupies in Latin is as corresponding to the\r\naspirate in Greek words derived from the same Pelasgic roots. Thus ὓς,\r\nἓξ, ὓλη, &c., are represented by _sus_, _sex_, _silva_. This may\r\npossibly be accounted for by the fact that S is in reality a very\r\npowerful aspirate. It is only necessary to try the experiment, in order\r\nto prove that a strong expiration produces a hissing sound. Those words\r\nwhich in classical Greek are written without an aspirate, such as εἰ,\r\nἄναξ, &c., which, nevertheless, have an _s_ in Latin, as si, senex, &c.,\r\nmay possibly have been at one period pronounced with the stronger\r\nbreathing. The most remarkable change, however, which has taken place\r\nwith respect to this letter, in the transition from the old to the\r\nclassical Latin, is the substitution of _r_ for _s_. Thus _Fusius_,\r\n_Papisius_, _eso_, _arbos_, &c., become _Furius_, _Papirius_, _ero_,\r\n_arbor_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe following table exhibits the principal changes undergone by the\r\nvowels and diphthongs:—\r\n\r\n           _In modern Latin._                  _In ancient Latin._\r\n E was represented by i, sometimes u, as luci, condumnari,\r\n I was represented by u, ei, e, o        optume, nominus, preivatus,\r\n                                           dedit, senatuos.\r\n U was represented by oi, ou, o          quoius, ploirume, douco, honc.\r\n Æ was represented by ai                 Aidiles.\r\n Œ was represented by oi                 proilium.\r\n     The vowels were sometimes doubled, as leegi, luuci, haace.[72]\r\n\r\nIn the grammatical inflexions, the principal difference between the old\r\nand the new Latin is, that in nouns the old forms were longer, and\r\nassumed their modern form by a process of contraction, and that the\r\nablative ended in _d_, as _Gnaivod_, _sententiad_; consequently the\r\nadverbial termination was the same as _suprad_, _bonod_, _malod_. The\r\nsame termination appears in the form of _tod_ in the singular number of\r\nthe imperative mood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n SATURNIAN METRE—OPINIONS RESPECTING ITS ORIGIN—EARLY EXAMPLES OF THIS\r\n  METRE—SATURNIAN BALLADS IN LIVY—STRUCTURE OF THE VERSE—INSTANCES OF\r\n                           RHYTHMICAL POETRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin and progress of the Roman language have now been briefly\r\ntraced, by the help of existing monuments, from the earliest dawn of its\r\nexistence, when the fusion of its discordant elements was so incomplete\r\nas to be scarcely intelligible, to the period when even in the unadorned\r\nform of public records it began to assume a classical shape. But such an\r\nanalysis will not be complete without some account of the verse in which\r\nthe earliest national poetry was composed.\r\n\r\nThe oldest measure used by the Latin poets was the Saturnian. According\r\nto Hermann,[73] there is no doubt that it was derived from the\r\nEtruscans, and that long before the fountains of Greek literature were\r\nopened; the strains of the Italian bards flowed in this metre, until\r\nEnnius introduced the heroic hexameter. The grammarian Diomedes[74]\r\nattributed the invention of it to Nævius, and seems to imply that the\r\nRoman poet derived the idea from the Greeks, for his theory is, that he\r\nformed the verse by adding a syllable to the Iambic trimeter.\r\nTerentianus Maurus, as well as Atilius, professed to find verses of this\r\nkind in the tragedies of Euripides and the odes of Callimachus, and\r\nServius and Censorinus attempted to analyze the Saturnian according to\r\nthe strict rules of Greek prosody; but they were obliged to permit every\r\nconceivable license, and to make Roman rudeness an excuse for a\r\nviolation of those rules which they themselves had arbitrarily imposed.\r\nThe opinion of Bentley was, that it was a Greek metre introduced into\r\nItaly by Nævius.[75] The only argument in favour of the latter theory is\r\nthe fact that the Saturnian is found amongst the verses of Archilochus;\r\nbut many circumstances, which shall hereafter be pointed out, combine to\r\nmake it far more probable that the use of it by the Greek poet is an\r\naccidental coincidence, than that the old Roman bards copied it from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhatever be its history, there can be no doubt that, if it did not\r\noriginate in Italy, its rhythm in very early times recommended itself to\r\nthe Italian ear, and became the recognised vehicle of their national\r\npoetry. A rude resemblance of it is discernible in the Eugubine tables;\r\nit had obtained a more advanced degree of perfection in the Arvalian\r\nchants, and the _axamenta_[76] or Salian hymns. Examples of it are found\r\nin fragments of Roman laws, which Livy[77] refers to the reign of Tullus\r\nHostilius, and Cicero[78] to that of Tarquinius Priscus. The epitaphs of\r\nthe Scipios are in fact Saturnian næniæ. Ennius, whose era was\r\nsufficiently early for him to know that Nævius, instead of being the\r\ninventor of a new verse, or the introducer of a Greek one, followed the\r\nexample of his predecessors, finds fault with the antiquated rudeness of\r\nhis Saturnians.\r\n\r\n                               Scripsere alii rem\r\n           Versibus quos olim Fauni Vatesque canebant\r\n           Quom neque Musarum scopulos quisquam superarat,\r\n           Nec dicti studiosus erat.\r\n\r\n                             Some in such verses wrote,\r\n               As sung the Fauns and Bards in olden times,\r\n               When none had scaled the Muses’ rocky heights\r\n               Or studied graceful diction.\r\n\r\nHad the Saturnian been introduced from Greece, Ennius would not have\r\ndenied to it the inspiration of the Muses, or have doubted that its\r\nbirthplace was on the rocky peaks of Parnassus, nor would his ear,\r\nattuned to the varied melody of Greek poetry, have been unconscious of\r\nits simple and natural rhythm, and have entirely rejected it for the\r\nmore ponderous and grandiloquent hexameter. The truth is, the taste\r\nwhich was formed by the study of Greek letters created a prejudice\r\nagainst the old national verse. As it was not Greek, it was pronounced\r\nrough and unmusical, and was exploded as old-fashioned. The well-known\r\npassage of Horace represents the prevailing feeling, although he says\r\nthat the Saturnian remained long after the introduction of the\r\nhexameter, and that, even in his own day, when Virgil had brought the\r\nLatin hexameter to the highest degree of perfection, a few traces of\r\nthat old long-lost poetry, which Cicero[79] wished for back again, might\r\nstill be discovered:—\r\n\r\n     Græcia capta ferum victorem cepit et artes\r\n     Intulit agresti Latio. Sic horridus ille\r\n     Defluxit numerus Saturnius, et grave virus\r\n     Munditiæ pepulere: sed in longum tamen ævum\r\n     Manserunt, hodieque manent vestigia ruris.\r\n                                               _Ep._ II., ii. 156.\r\n\r\nSome passages of Livy bear evident marks of having been originally\r\nportions of Saturnian ballads, although the historian has mutilated the\r\nmetre by the process of translating them into more modern Latin. The\r\nprophetic warning of C. Marcius[80] has been thus restored by Hermann\r\nwith but slight alteration of the words of Livy:\r\n\r\n           Amnén, Trojúgena, Cánnam fuge, ne te alienigenæ\r\n           Cogánt in cámpo Díomedéi manús consérere;\r\n           Sed nec credes tu mihi, donec complessis sangui\r\n           Campum, miliaque multa occisa tua tetulerit\r\n           Is amnis in portum magnum ex terra frugifera.\r\n           Piscibus avibus ferisque quæ incolunt terras, eis\r\n           Fuat esca carnis tua; ita Juppiter mihi fatus.\r\n\r\nThe oracle which tradition recorded as having been brought from Delphi\r\nrespecting the waters of the Alban lake[81] was evidently embodied in a\r\nSaturnian poem, probably the composition of the same Marcius, or one of\r\nhis contemporaries, such as Fabius Pictor, Cincius Alimentus, or\r\nAcilius. This lay has also been conjecturally restored by Hermann.\r\n\r\n           Romane aquam Albanam lacu cave contineri,\r\n           Cave in mare immanare suopte flumine siris;\r\n           Missam manu per agros rigassis, dissipatam\r\n           Rivis extinxis, tum tu insistito hostium audax\r\n           Muris memor, quam per tot annos circum obsides\r\n           Urbem, ex ea tibi his, quæ nunc panduntur fatis,\r\n           Victoriam datam; bello perfecto donum\r\n           Amplum ad mea victor templa portato; sacra patria\r\n           Nec curata instaurato, utique adsolitum, facito.\r\n\r\nIn later times Livius Andronicus translated the whole Odyssey into\r\nSaturnians, and Nævius wrote in the same metre a poem consisting of\r\nseven books, the subject of which was the first Punic war. Detached\r\nfragments of both these have been preserved by Aulus Gellius, Priscian,\r\nFestus, and others, which have been collected together by Hermann.[82]\r\n\r\nThe structure of the Saturnian is very simple, and its rhythmical\r\narrangement is found in the poetry of every age and country.\r\nMacaulay[83] quotes the following Saturnians from the poem of the Cid\r\nand from the Nibelungen-Lied—\r\n\r\n              Estás nuevás a mío | Cíd erán venídas\r\n              A mí lo dían; á ti | dán las órejádas.\r\n            Man móhte míchel wúnder | vón Sifríde ságen\r\n            Wa ích den kúnic vínde | dás sol mán mir ságen.\r\n\r\nHe adds, also, an example of a perfect Saturnian, the following line\r\nfrom the well known nursery song—\r\n\r\n         The quéen was ín her párlour | eáting breád and hóney.\r\n\r\nIt was the metre naturally adapted to the national mode of dancing, in\r\nwhich each alternate step strongly marked the time,[84] and the\r\nrhythmical beat was repeated in a series of three bars, which gave to\r\nthe dance the appellation of tripudium.\r\n\r\nThe Saturnian consists of two parts, each containing three feet, which\r\nfall upon the ear with the same effect as Greek trochees. The whole is\r\npreceded by a syllable in thesis technically called an anacrusis. For\r\nexample—\r\n\r\n            Sum|más o|pés qui | régum ‖ régi|ás re|frégit ‖\r\n\r\nThe metre in its original form was perfectly independent of the rules of\r\nGreek prosody; its only essential requisite was the beat or ictus on the\r\nalternate syllable or its representative. The only law to regulate the\r\nstress was that of the common popular pronunciation. In fact, stress\r\noccupied the place of quantity. Two or three syllables, which, according\r\nto the rules of prosody would be long by position, might be slurred over\r\nor pronounced rapidly in the time of one, as in the following line:—\r\n\r\n            Amném Trojúgena Cánnam | fúge ne té alienígenæ.\r\n\r\nThus it is clear that the principles which regulated it were those of\r\nmodern versification, without any of the niceties and delicacies of\r\nGreek quantity.\r\n\r\nThe anacrusis resembles the introductory note to a musical air, and does\r\nnot interfere with the essential quality of the verse, namely, the three\r\nbeats twice repeated, any more than it does in English poems, in which\r\noctosyllabic lines, having the stress on the even places, are\r\nintermingled with verses of seven syllables, as in the following passage\r\nof Milton’s L’Allegro:—\r\n\r\n                  Come and trip it as you go\r\n                  On the light fantastic toe,\r\n                  And in thy right hand lead with thee\r\n                  The mountain nymph, sweet Liberty;\r\n                  And if I give thee honour due,\r\n                  Mirth, admit me of thy crew.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that in the degenerate periods of Latin literature,\r\nthere was a return to the same old rhythmical principles which gave\r\nbirth to the Saturnian verse: ictus was again substituted for quantity,\r\nand the Greek rules of prosody were neglected for a rhythm consisting of\r\nalternate beats, which pervades most modern poetry.\r\n\r\nThe empire had become so extensive, that the taste of the people,\r\nespecially of the provincials, was no longer regulated by that of the\r\ncapital, and emphasis and accent became, instead of metrical quantity,\r\nthe general rule of pronunciation. This was the origin of rhythmical\r\npoetry. Traces of it may be found as early as the satirical verses of\r\nSuetonius on J. Cæsar.\r\n\r\nIt is the metre of the little jeu d’esprit addressed by the emperor\r\nHadrian to Florus—[85]\r\n\r\n                         Ego nolo Florus esse\r\n                         Ambulare per tabernas\r\n                         Latitare per popinas\r\n                         Culices pati rotundos;\r\n\r\nand also of the historian’s repartee—\r\n\r\n                        Ego nolo Cæsar esse\r\n                        Ambulare per Britannos\r\n                        Scythicas pati pruinas.\r\n\r\nThe simple grandeur of such strains as—\r\n\r\n                     Dies iræ, dies illa,\r\n                     Solvet sæclum in favilla, &c.\r\n\r\nand other monkish hymns, go far to rescue the old Saturnian from the\r\ncharge of ruggedness and rusticity ascribed to it by Horace and others,\r\nwhose taste was formed by Greek poetry, and whose fastidious ears could\r\nnot brook any harmony but that which had been consecrated to the\r\noutpourings of Greek genius.\r\n\r\nFrom this species of verse, which probably prevailed among the natives\r\nof Provence (the Roman Provincia) the Troubadours derived the metre of\r\ntheir ballad poetry, and thence introduced it into the rest of Europe.\r\nBut whatever phases the external form of ancient poetry underwent, the\r\nclassical writers both of Greece and Rome eschewed rhyme. Even to a\r\nmodern ear the beautiful effect of the ancient metres is entirely\r\ndestroyed by it. It was a false taste and a less refined ear which could\r\naccept it as a compensation for the imperfections of prosody.\r\n\r\nAlthough rhyme was introduced as an embellishment of verses framed on\r\nthe principle of ictus, and not of quantity, at a very early period of\r\nChristian Latin literature, it is not quite certain when it came to be\r\nadded as a new difficulty to the metres of classical antiquity. It is\r\nrecorded by Gray[86] that when the children educated in the monastery of\r\nSt. Gall addressed a Bishop of Constance on his first visitation with\r\nexpostulatory orations, the younger ones recited the following doggerel\r\nrhymes:—\r\n\r\n              Quid tibi fecimus tale ut nobis facias male\r\n              Appellamus regem quia nostram fecimus legem.\r\n\r\nThe elder and more advanced students spoke in rhyming hexameters:—\r\n\r\n             Non nobis pia spes fuerat cum sis novus hospes\r\n             Ut vetus in pejus transvertere tute velis jus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n  THREE PERIODS OF ROMAN CLASSICAL LITERATURE—ITS ELEMENTS RUDE—ROMAN\r\n   RELIGION—ETRUSCAN INFLUENCE—EARLY HISTORICAL MONUMENTS—FESCENNINE\r\n   VERSES—FABULÆ ATELLANÆ—INTRODUCTION OF STAGE PLAYERS—DERIVATION OF\r\n                                SATIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe era during which Roman classical literature commenced, arrived at\r\nperfection, and declined, may be conveniently divided into three\r\nperiods. The first of these embraces its rise and progress, such traces\r\nas are discoverable of oral and traditional compositions, the rude\r\nelements of the drama, the introduction of Greek literature, and the\r\ncultivation of the national taste in accordance with this model, the\r\ninfancy of eloquence, and the construction and perfection of comedy.\r\n\r\nTo this period the first five centuries of the republic may be\r\nconsidered as introductory; the groundwork and foundation were then\r\nbeing gradually laid on which the superstructure was built up; for,\r\nproperly speaking, Rome had no literature until the conclusion of the\r\nfirst Punic war.[87]\r\n\r\nIndependently therefore of these 500 years, this period consists of 160\r\nyears extending from the time when Livius Andronicus flourished[88] to\r\nthe first appearance of Cicero in public life.[89]\r\n\r\nThe second period ends with the death of Augustus.[90] It comprehends\r\nthe age of which Cicero is the representative, as the most accomplished\r\norator, philosopher, and prose writer of his times, as well as that of\r\nAugustus, which is commonly called the golden age of Latin poetry.\r\n\r\nThe third and last period of Roman classical literature terminates with\r\nthe death of Hadrian.[91] Notwithstanding the numerous excellencies\r\nwhich will be seen to distinguish the literature of this period, its\r\ndecline had evidently commenced. It missed the patronage of Augustus and\r\nhis refined court, and was chilled by the baneful influence of his\r\ntyrannical successors. As the age of Augustus has been distinguished by\r\nthe epithet “golden,” so the succeeding period has been, on account of\r\nits comparative inferiority, designated as “the silver age.”\r\n\r\nThe Romans, like all other nations, had oral poetical compositions\r\nbefore they possessed any written literature. Cicero, in three\r\nplaces,[92] speaks of the banquet being enlivened by the songs of bards,\r\nin which the exploits of heroes were recited and celebrated. By these\r\nlays national pride and family vanity were gratified, and the anecdotes\r\nthus preserved by memory furnished the sources of early legendary\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nBut these lays and legends must not be compared to those of Greece,\r\nwhich had probably taken an epic form long before they furnished the\r\ngroundwork of the Iliad and the Odyssey. In Roman tradition there are no\r\ntraces of elevated genius or poetical inspiration. The religious\r\nsentiment was the fertile source of Greek fancy, which gave a\r\nsupernatural glory to the effusions of the bard, painted men as heroes,\r\nand heroes as deities; and, whilst it was the natural growth of the\r\nGreek intellect, twined itself round the affections of the whole people.\r\n\r\nRoman religion was a ceremonial for the priests, not for the people; and\r\nits poetry was merely formulæ in verse, and soared no higher than the\r\nsemi-barbarous ejaculations of the Salian priests or the Arvalian\r\nbrotherhood. Fabulous legends doubtless formed the groundwork of\r\nhistory, and therefore probably constituted the festive entertainments\r\nto which Cicero alludes; but they were rude and simple, and the\r\nnarratives founded upon them, which are embodied in the pages of Livy\r\nand others, are as much improved by the embellishments of the historian,\r\nas these in their turn have been expanded by the poetic talent of\r\nMacaulay.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to conceive that the uncouth literature which\r\nwas contemporary with such rude relics as have come down to modern times\r\nshould have displayed a higher degree of imaginative power. A few simple\r\ndescriptive lines, one or two animating and heart-stirring sentiments,\r\nand no more, would be tolerated as an interruption to the grosser\r\npleasures of the table amongst a rude and boisterous people. The Romans\r\nwere men of actions, not of words; their intellect, though vigorous, was\r\nessentially of a practical character: it was such as to form warriors,\r\nstatesmen, jurists, orators, but not poets; in the highest sense of the\r\nword, _i. e._ if by poetic talent is meant the creative faculty of the\r\nimagination. The Roman mind possessed the germs of those faculties which\r\nadmit of cultivation and improvement, such as taste and genius, and the\r\nappreciation of the beautiful, and their endowments rendered them\r\ncapable of attaining literary excellence; it did not possess the natural\r\ngifts of fancy and imagination, which were part and parcel of the Greek\r\nmind, and which made them in a state of infancy, almost of barbarism, a\r\npoetical people.\r\n\r\nWith the Romans literature was not of spontaneous growth: it was the\r\nresult of external influence. It is impossible to fix the period at\r\nwhich they first became subject to this influence, but it is clear that\r\nin everything mental and spiritual their neighbours the Etruscans were\r\ntheir teachers. The influence exercised by this remarkable people was\r\nnot only religious, but moral: its primary object was discipline, its\r\nsecondary one refinement. If it cultivated the intellectual powers, it\r\nwas with a view to disciplining the moral faculties. To this pure\r\nculture the old Roman character owed its vigour, its honesty, its\r\nincorruptible sternness, and those virtues which are summed up in the\r\ncomprehensive and truly Roman word “gravitas.” History proves that these\r\nqualities had a real existence—that they were not the mere ideal\r\nphantasies of those who loved to praise times gone by. The error into\r\nwhich those fell who mourned over the loss of the old Roman discipline,\r\nand lamented the degeneracy of their own times, was, that they\r\nattributed this degeneracy to the onward march of refinement and\r\ncivilization, and not to the accidental circumstance that this march was\r\naccompanied by profligacy and effeminacy, and that the race which was\r\nthe dispensers of these blessings was a corrupt and degenerate one. They\r\ncould not separate the causes and the effects; they did not see that\r\nRome was intellectually advanced by Greek literature, but that\r\nunfortunately it was degraded at the same time by Greek profligacy.\r\n\r\nFor centuries the Roman mind was imbued with Etruscan literature; and\r\nLivy[93] asserts that, just as Greek was in his own day, it continued to\r\nbe the instrument of Roman education during five centuries after the\r\nfoundation of the city.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the Roman mind was essentially utilitarian. Even Cicero,\r\nwith all his varied accomplishments, will recognise but one end and\r\nobject of all study, namely, those sciences which will render a man\r\nuseful to his country:—“Quid esse igitur censes discendum nobis?... Eas\r\nartes quæ efficiunt ut usui civitati simus; id enim esse præclarissimum\r\nsapientiæ munus maximumque virtutis vel documentum vel officium\r\nputo.”[94] We must, therefore, expect to find the law of literary\r\ndevelopment modified in accordance with this ruling principle. From the\r\nvery beginning, the final cause of Roman literature will be found to\r\nhave been a view to utility, and not the satisfaction of an impulsive\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nIn other nations poetry has been the first spontaneous production. With\r\nthe Romans the first literary effort was history. But their early\r\nhistory consisted simply of annals and memorials—records of facts, not\r\nof ideas or sentiments. It was calculated to form a storehouse of\r\nvaluable materials for future ages, but it had no impress of genius or\r\nthought; its merits were truth and accuracy; its very facts were often\r\nfrivolous and unimportant, neither rendered interesting as narratives,\r\nnor illustrated by reflections. These original documents were elements\r\nof literature rather than deserving the name of literature\r\nitself—antiquarian rather than historical. The earliest records of this\r\nkind were the _Libri Lintei_—manuscripts written on rolls of linen\r\ncloth, to which Livy refers as containing the first treaty between Rome\r\nand Carthage, and the truce made with Ardea and Gabii.[95] To these may\r\nbe added the _Annales Maximi_, or _Commentarii Pontificum_, of the\r\nminute accuracy of which, the following account is given by Servius.[96]\r\n“Every year the chief pontiff inscribed on a white tablet, at the head\r\nof which were the names of the consuls and other magistrates, a daily\r\nrecord of all memorable events both at home and abroad. These\r\ncommentaries or registers were afterwards collected into eighty books,\r\nwhich were entitled by their authors _Annales Maximi_.”\r\n\r\nSimilar notes of the year were kept regularly from the earliest periods\r\nby the civil magistrates, and are spoken of by Latin authors under the\r\ntitles of _Commentarii Consulares_, _Libri Prætorum_, and _Tabulæ\r\nCensoriæ_. All these records, however, which were anterior to the\r\ncapture of Rome by the Gauls, perished in the conflagration of the city.\r\n\r\nEach patrician house, also, had its private family history, and the\r\nlaudatory orations said to have been recited at the funerals of\r\nillustrious members, were carefully preserved, as adorning and\r\nillustrating their nobility; but this heraldic literature obscured\r\ninstead of throwing a light upon history: it was filled with false\r\ntriumphs, imaginary consulships, and forged genealogies.[97]\r\n\r\nThe earliest attempt at poetry, or rather versification, for it was\r\nsimply the outward form and not the inward spirit which the rude\r\ninhabitants of Latium attained, was satire in somewhat of a dramatic\r\nform. _The Fescennine songs_ were metrical, for the accompaniments of\r\nmusic and dancing necessarily subjected their extemporaneous effusions\r\nto the restrictions of a rude measure. Like the first theatrical\r\nexhibitions of the Greeks, they had their origin, not in towns, but\r\namongst the rural population. They were not, like Greek tragedy,\r\nperformed in honour of a deity, nor did they form a portion of a\r\nreligious ceremonial. Still, however, they were the accompaniment of it,\r\nthe pastime of the village festival. Religion was the excuse for the\r\nholiday sport, and amusement its natural occupation. At first they were\r\ninnocent and gay, their mirth overflowed in boisterous but good-humoured\r\nrepartee; but liberty at length degenerated into license, and gave birth\r\nto malicious and libellous attacks on persons of irreproachable\r\ncharacter.[98] As the licentiousness of Greek comedy provoked the\r\ninterference of the legislature, so the laws of the Twelve Tables\r\nforbade the personalities of the Fescennine verses.\r\n\r\nThis infancy of song illustrates the character of the Romans in its\r\nrudest and coarsest form. They loved strife, both bodily and mental:\r\nwith them the highest exercise of the intellect was in legal conflict\r\nand political debate; and, on the same principle, the pleasure which the\r\nspectators in the rural theatre derived from this species of attack and\r\ndefence, approached somewhat nearly to the enthusiasm with which they\r\nwould have witnessed an exhibition of gladiatorial skill. The rustic\r\ndelighted in the strife of words as he would in the wrestling matches\r\nwhich also formed a portion of his day’s sports, and thus early\r\ndisplayed that taste, which, in more polished ages, and in the hands of\r\ncultivated poets, was developed in the sharp cutting wit, the lively but\r\npiercing points of Roman satire.\r\n\r\nThe Fescennine verses show that the Romans possessed a natural aptitude\r\nfor satire. The pleasure derived from this species of writing, as well\r\nas the moral influence exercised by it, depends not upon an æsthetic\r\nappreciation of the beautiful, but on a high sense of moral duty; and\r\nsuch a sense displays itself in a stern and indignant abhorrence of vice\r\nrather than a disposition to be attracted by the charms and loveliness\r\nof virtue. The Romans were a stern, not an æsthetic people, consequently\r\nsatire is the most original of all Roman literature, and the perfect and\r\npolished form which it afterwards assumed was entirely their own. They\r\ndid, indeed, afterwards acutely observe and readily seize upon those\r\nparts of Greek literature which were subservient to this end, and hence\r\nLucilius, the founder of Roman satire, eagerly adopted the models and\r\nmaterials which Greek comedy placed at his disposal, and thus became, as\r\nHorace[99] writes, a disciple of Eupolis, Cratinus, and Aristophanes.\r\n\r\nSo permanent was the popularity of these entertainments that they even\r\nsurvived the introduction of Greek letters, and received a polish and\r\nrefinement from the change which then took place in the spirit of the\r\nnational poetry.[100] It has been said, that in these rude elements of\r\nthe drama, Etruria was the first teacher of Latium, and that the\r\nepithet, Fescennine, perpetuates the name of an Etrurian village,\r\nFescennia, from which the amusement derived its origin; but Niebuhr has\r\nshown that Fescennia was not an Etruscan village, and, therefore, that\r\nthis etymology is untenable.\r\n\r\nThe most probable etymology of the word Fescennine is one given by\r\nFestus.[101] Fascinium was the Greek Phallus, the emblem of fertility;\r\nand as the origin of Greek comedy was derived from the rustic Phallic\r\nsongs, so he considers that the same ceremonial may be, in some way,\r\nconnected with the Fescennine verses. If this be the true account, the\r\nEtruscans furnished the spectacle—all that which addresses itself to the\r\neye, whilst the habits of Italian rural life supplied the sarcastic\r\nhumour and ready extemporaneous gibe, which are the essence of the true\r\ncomic; and these combined elements having migrated from the country to\r\nthe capital, and being enthusiastically adopted by young men of more\r\nrefined taste and more liberal education, afterwards paved the way for\r\nthe introduction and adaptation of Greek comedy.\r\n\r\nIf in these improvisatory dialogues may be discerned the germ of the\r\nRoman Comic Drama, the next advance in point of art must be attributed\r\nto the Oscans. Their quasi-dramatic entertainments were most popular\r\namongst the Italian nations. They represented in broad caricature\r\nnational peculiarities: the language of the dialogue was, of course,\r\noriginally Oscan, the characters of the drama were Oscan likewise.[102]\r\nThe principal one was called Macchus, whose part was that of the Clown\r\nin the modern pantomime. Another was termed Bucco, who was a kind of\r\nPantaloon, or charlatan. Much of the wit consisted in practical jokes\r\nlike that of the Italian Polichinello. These entertainments were\r\nsometimes called Ludi Osci, but they are more commonly known by the\r\ntitle of Fabulæ Atellanæ, from Aderla,[103] or, as the Romans pronounced\r\nit, Atella, a town in Campania, where they were very popular, or perhaps\r\nfirst performed. After their introduction at Rome they underwent great\r\nmodifications and received important improvements. They lost their\r\nnative rusticity; their satire was good natured; their jests were\r\nseemly, and kept in check by the laws of good taste, and were free from\r\nscurrility or obscenity.[104] They seem in later times to have been\r\ndivided, like comedies, into five acts, with exodia,[105] _i. e._\r\nfarcical interludes in verse, interspersed between them. Nor were they\r\nacted by the common professional performers. The Atellan actors[106]\r\nformed a peculiar class; they were not considered infamous, nor were\r\nthey excluded from the tribes, but enjoyed the privilege of immunity\r\nfrom military service. Even a private Roman citizen might take a part in\r\nthem without disgrace or disfranchisement, although these were the\r\nsocial penalties imposed upon the regular _histrio_. The Fabulæ Atellanæ\r\nintroduced thus early remained in favour for centuries. The dictator\r\nSylla is said to have amused his leisure hours in writing them; and\r\nSuetonius bears testimony to their having been a popular amusement under\r\nthe empire.\r\n\r\nAs early, however, as the close of the fourth century, the drama took a\r\nmore artificial form. In the consulship of C. Sulpicius Peticus and C.\r\nDicinius Stolo,[107] a pestilence devastated Rome. In order to deprecate\r\nthe anger of the gods, a solemn lectisternium was proclaimed; couches of\r\nmarble were prepared, with cushions and coverlets of tapestry, on which\r\nwere placed the statues of the deities in a reclining posture. Before\r\nthem were placed well-spread tables, as though they were able to partake\r\nof the feast. On this occasion a company of stage-players (_histriones_)\r\nwere sent for from Etruria, as a means, according to Livy[108] of\r\npropitiating the favour of Heaven; but probably also for the wiser\r\npurpose of diverting the popular mind from the contemplation of their\r\nown suffering. These entertainments were a novelty to a people whose\r\nonly recognised public sports, up to that time, with the exception of\r\nthe rural drama already described, had been trials of bodily strength\r\nand skill. The exhibitions of the Etruscan histriones consisted of\r\ngraceful national dances, accompanied with the music of the flute, but\r\nwithout either songs or dramatic action. They were, therefore, simply\r\n_ballets_, and not _dramas_.\r\n\r\nThus the Etruscans furnished the suggestion: the Romans improved upon\r\nit, and invested it with a dramatic character. They combined the old\r\nFescennine songs with the newly introduced dances. The varied metres\r\nwhich the unrestrained nature of their rude verse permitted to the vocal\r\nparts, gave to this mixed entertainment the name of satura (a\r\nhodge-podge or pot-pourri,) from which in after times the word satire\r\nwas derived. The actors in these quasi-dramas were professed histriones,\r\nand no further alteration took place until that introduced by Livius\r\nAndronicus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\nEMANCIPATION OF LIVIUS ANDRONICUS—HIS IMITATION OF THE ODYSSEY—NEW KIND\r\nOF SCENIC EXHIBITIONS—FIRST EXHIBITION OF HIS DRAMAS—NÆVIUS A POLITICAL\r\nPARTISAN—HIS BITTERNESS—HIS PUNIC WAR—HIS NATIONALITY—HIS VERSIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n            LIVIUS ANDRONICUS (FLOURISHED ABOUT B. C. 240.)\r\n\r\nThe events already related had by this time prepared the Roman people\r\nfor the reception of a more regular drama, when, at the conclusion of\r\nthe first Punic War, the influence of Greek intellect, which had already\r\nlong been felt in Italy, extended to the capital. But not only did the\r\nRomans owe to Greece the principles of literary taste, and the original\r\nmodels from which the elements of that taste were derived, but their\r\nfirst and earliest poet was one of that nation. Livius Andronicus,\r\nalthough born in Italy, educated in the Latin tongue at Rome, and\r\nsubsequently a naturalized Roman, is generally supposed to have been a\r\nnative of the Greek colony of Tarentum. He was a man of cultivated mind,\r\nand well versed in the literature of his nation, especially in dramatic\r\npoetry. How he came to be at Rome in the condition of a slave, it is\r\nimpossible to say. Attius stated that he was taken prisoner at Tarentum\r\nby Q. Fabius Maximus, when he recovered that city, in the tenth year of\r\nthe second Punic War. But Cicero shows, on the authority of Atticus,\r\nthat this date is thirty years later than the period at which he first\r\nexhibited at Rome, and Niebuhr[109] considers that the reason why he is\r\ncalled a Tarentine captive is, from being confounded with one M. Livius\r\nMacatus, mentioned by Livy.[110] He may perhaps have owed his change of\r\nfortune to being made a prisoner of war; at any rate, he became one of\r\nthe household of M. Livius Salinator, and occupied the confidential\r\nposition of instructor to his children. The employment as tutors of\r\nGreek slaves, who, being men of education and refinement, had fallen\r\ninto this position by the fortune of war, was customary with the wealthy\r\nRomans. By this means there was rapidly introduced amongst the rising\r\ngeneration of the higher classes a knowledge of that language and\r\nlearning which the Romans so eagerly embraced and so enthusiastically\r\nadmired.\r\n\r\nFidelity in so important a situation generally gained the esteem and\r\naffection of the patron. The generous Roman became a protector of the\r\nman of genius rather than his master, and conferred upon him the gift of\r\nfreedom. Andronicus was emancipated under such circumstances as these,\r\nand according to custom received the name of his former master, Livius,\r\nand his civil and political rank became that of an ærarius. He wrote a\r\ntranslation, or perhaps an imitation of the Odyssey, in the old\r\nSaturnian metre, and also a few hymns. Niebuhr supposes that the reason\r\nwhy he has translated or epitomized the Odyssey in preference to the\r\nIliad is, that it would have greater attractions for the Romans, in\r\nconsequence of the relation which it bore to the ancient legends of\r\nItaly. The sea which washes the coast of Italy was the scene of many of\r\nthe most marvellous adventures of Ulysses. Sicily, in which, owing to\r\nthe wars with Hiero and the Carthaginians, the Romans now began to take\r\na lively interest, was represented in the Odyssey as abounding in the\r\nelements of poetry. Circe’s fairy abode was within sight of land—a\r\npromontory of Latium bore her name, and one of Ulysses’ sons by her was,\r\naccording to the legend of Hesiod, Latinus, the patriarch of the Latin\r\nname. His principal works, however, were tragedies. The passion of the\r\nRomans for shows and exhibitions, the love of action, and of stirring\r\nbusiness-like occupation, which characterizes them, would make the drama\r\npopular, and it would harmonize with the public entertainments, in which\r\nthey had been accustomed to take pleasure from the earliest times, when\r\ntradition informs us that the founder of their race instituted the\r\nsolemn games to the equestrian Neptune, and invited all the neighbours\r\nto the spectacle;[111] and when Ancus celebrated with unwonted splendour\r\nthe Great Games, and appointed separate seats and boxes for the knights\r\nand senators.[112] It was probable that Livius Andronicus, coming\r\nforward as the introducer of a new era in literature, would study the\r\ncharacter as well as the language of his newly-adopted countrymen, and\r\nendeavour to please them as well as teach them. In order to become\r\neventually a leader of the public taste, he would at first fall in with\r\nit to a certain degree. The process by which he moulded it after the\r\nmodel which he considered the true one, would be gentle and gradual, not\r\nsudden and abrupt. The paucity and brevity of the fragments which are\r\nextant furnish but little opportunity for forming an accurate estimate\r\nof his ability as a poet, and his competency to guide and form the taste\r\nof a people. Hermann[113] has collected together the fragments of the\r\nLatin Odyssey which are scattered through the works of Gellius,\r\nPriscian, Festus, Nonius, and others, and has compared them with the\r\nHomeric passages of which they are the translations. Few of these,\r\nhowever, are longer than a single line; and, therefore, the only opinion\r\nwhich can be formed respecting them is, that although the versification\r\nis rough and rhythmical rather than metrical, the language is vigorous\r\nand expressive, and conveys, as far as a translation can, the force and\r\nmeaning of the original.\r\n\r\nNor do the criticisms of the ancient classical authors furnish much\r\nassistance in coming to a decision. Their tastes were so completely\r\nGreek, and the prejudices of their education so strong, that they could\r\nscarcely confess the existence of excellence in a poet so old as\r\nAndronicus. Cicero says in the Brutus,[114] that his Latin Odyssey was\r\nas old-fashioned and rude as would have been the sculptures of Dædalus,\r\nand that his dramas would not bear a second perusal. Horace, however, is\r\nnot quite so sweeping in his strictures. He confesses that he would not\r\ncondemn the poems of Livius[115] to utter oblivion, although he\r\nremembers them in connexion with the floggings of his schoolmaster; but\r\nhe is surprised that any one should consider them polished and\r\nbeautiful, and not falling far short of critical exactness.\r\n\r\nA passage in the history of Livy seems to imply that Andronicus ventured\r\nupon some deviations from the ancient plan of scenic exhibitions.[116]\r\nAccording to him, Livius was the first who substituted, for the rude\r\nextemporaneous effusions of the Fescennine verse, plays with a regular\r\nplot and fable. He adds, that in consequence of losing his voice from\r\nbeing frequently encored, he obtained permission to introduce a boy to\r\nsing the ode, or air, to the accompaniment of the flute, whilst he\r\nhimself represented the action of the song by his gestures and dancing.\r\nHe was thus enabled to depict the subject with greater vigour and\r\nfreedom of pantomimic action, because he was unimpeded by the obligation\r\nto use his voice. Hence the custom began of the actor responding by his\r\ngesticulation to the song and music of another, whilst the dialogue\r\nbetween the odes was delivered without any musical accompaniment.\r\n\r\nThe passage of which the above is a paraphrase, is as follows:—“Livius\r\npost aliquot annos qui ab saturis ausus est primus argumento fabulam\r\nserere (idem scilicet, id quod omnes tum erant, suorum carminum actor)\r\ndicitur, quum sæpius revocatus vocem obtudisset, veniâ petitâ, puerum ad\r\ncanendum ante tibicinem quum statuisset, canticum egisse aliquanto magis\r\nvigente motu, quia nihil vocis usus impediebat. Inde ad manum cantari\r\nhistrionibus cæptum, diverbiaque tantum ipsorum voci relicta.” It is\r\nevident that this description points out the introduction of the\r\nprinciples of Greek art. We are reminded of the hyporchemes in honour of\r\nApollo, in which the gestures of certain members of the chorus\r\nrepresented the incidents related or sentiments expressed by the singer,\r\nand also the separation of the choral or musical part from the dialogue\r\nof a Greek tragedy. Nevertheless, the choral or lyrical portion of the\r\ndrama to which alone this novel practice introduced by Livius applies,\r\nfound but a small part in a Latin tragedy, if compared with those of the\r\nGreeks. In this alone the poet himself sustained a part, whilst the\r\nwhole of the dialogue (diverbia) was recited by professional performers.\r\n\r\nThis new style of dramatic performances, however, does not appear at\r\nfirst to have taken such hold upon the affections of the people as to\r\nsupersede their old amusements. They admitted them, and witnessed them\r\nwith pleasure and applause, but they would not give up the old. The\r\nyoung men wished their amusements to be really games and sports; they\r\nwere not content to be merely quiet spectators. Extemporaneous effusions\r\nwere more convenient for amateurs than regular plays, and joke and jest\r\nthan tragic earnest. The new custom introduced by Livius elevated the\r\ndrama above the region of ribaldry and laughter, but the art and skill\r\nrequisite confined the work to the professional performer. The young\r\nRomans, therefore, left to the stage-player the regular drama, restored\r\ntheir old amusement as an exodium or after-piece, and did not suffer it,\r\nas Livy says, to be “polluted” by the interference of _histriones_.\r\nAccording to the testimony of Cicero,[117] who makes his statement on\r\nthe authority of Atticus, Livius first exhibited his dramas in the year\r\nbefore the birth of Ennius, in the consulship of C. Clodius and M.\r\nTuditanus, A. U. C. 514.[118] This date is also adopted by Aulus\r\nGellius,[119] who places his first dramatic representations about a\r\nhundred and sixty years after the death of Sophocles, and fifty-two\r\nyears after that of Menander. The titles of his tragedies which are\r\nextant show that they were translations or adaptations from the Greek.\r\nAmongst them are those of Egisthus, Hermione, Tereus, Ajax, and Helena.\r\nFrom each of the last two one line is preserved, and four lines are\r\nquoted by Terentianus Maurus from his tragedy of Ino;[120] but the\r\nlanguage and metre render it far more probable that they were written by\r\nsome more modern poet. Two of his tragedies, the Clytemnestra and the\r\nTrojan Horse, were acted in the second consulship of Pompey the Great,\r\nat the inauguration of the splendid stone theatre[121] which he built.\r\nNo expense was spared in putting them upon the stage, for Cicero writes,\r\nin a letter to M. Marius,[122] that three thousand bucklers, the spoils\r\nof foreign nations, were exhibited in the latter, and a procession of\r\nsix hundred mules, probably richly caparisoned, were introduced in the\r\nformer, whilst cavalry and infantry, clad in various armour, mingled in\r\nmimic combat on the scene. He considers, however, that this splendour\r\nwas an offence against good taste, and that the enjoyment was spoilt by\r\nthe gorgeousness of the spectacle. The taste of his patrons, the Roman\r\npeople, as well as the testimony of antiquity, render it highly probable\r\nthat he was the author of comedies[123] as well as tragedies. Festus\r\nspeaks of one, of which he quotes a single line, for the sake of its\r\nphilological value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CN. NÆVIUS.\r\n\r\nNævius was the first poet who really deserves the name of Roman. His\r\ncountrymen in all ages, as well as his contemporaries, looked upon him\r\nas one of themselves. The probability is, that he was not actually born\r\nat Rome, though even this has been maintained with some show of\r\nplausibility.[124] He was, at any rate, by birth entitled to the\r\nmunicipal franchise, and from his earliest boyhood was a resident in the\r\ncapital. Nor was he a mere servile imitator, but applied Greek taste and\r\ncultivation to the development of Roman sentiments. A true Roman in\r\nheart and spirit in his fearless attachment to liberty; his stern\r\nopposition to all who dared invade the rights of his fellow-citizens; he\r\nwas unsparing in his censure of immorality, and his admiration for\r\nheroic self-devotion. He was a soldier, and imbibed the free and martial\r\nenthusiasm which breathes in his poems when he fought the battles of his\r\ncountry in the first Punic War. His honest principles cemented, in his\r\nlater years, a strong friendship between him and the upright and\r\nunbending Cato,[125]—a friendship which probably contributed to form the\r\npolitical and literary character of that stern old Roman.\r\n\r\nIt is generally assumed that Nævius was a Campanian; but the only reason\r\nfor this assumption is, that A. Gellius[126] criticises his epitaph, of\r\nwhich Nævius himself was the author, as full of Campanian pride.\r\n\r\nThe time of his birth is unknown, but it is probable that his public\r\ncareer commenced within a very few years after that of Livius. Gellius\r\nfixes the exhibition of his first drama in B. C. 235,[127] and Cicero\r\nplaces his death in the consulship of M. Cornelius Cethegus and P.\r\nSempronius Tuditanus,[128] although he allows that Varro, who places it\r\nsomewhat later, is the most pains-taking of Roman antiquarians. It is\r\nalso certain that he died at an advanced age, for, according to Cicero,\r\nhe was an old man when he wrote one of his poems. He was the author of\r\nan epic poem, the title of which was the Punic War; but, owing to the\r\npopularity of dramatic literature, his earliest literary productions\r\nwere tragedies and comedies. The titles of most of these show that their\r\nsubjects were Greek legends or stories. It was, therefore, in his epic\r\npoem that the acknowledged originality of his talents was mainly\r\ndisplayed. Nævius was a strong political partisan, a warm supporter of\r\nthe people against the encroachments of the nobility. In consequence of\r\nthe expenditure during the war, great part of the population was reduced\r\nto poverty, and a strong line of demarkation was drawn between the rich\r\nand the poor. The estrangement and want of sympathy between those two\r\nclasses were daily increasing. The barrier of _caste_ was indeed almost\r\ndestroyed, but that of _class_ was beginning to be erected in its stead.\r\nThe passing of the Licinian bills[129] had led to the gradual rise of a\r\nplebeian nobility. The Ogulnian law[130] had admitted patrician and\r\nplebeian to a religious as well as political equality, and more than\r\nthree-quarters of a century had passed away since Appius Claudius the\r\nblind[131] had given political existence to the freedmen by admitting\r\nthem into the tribes, and had even raised some whose fathers had been\r\nfreedmen to the rank of senators, to the exclusion of many distinguished\r\nplebeians who had filled curule offices. The object which he proposed to\r\nhimself by this policy was undoubtedly the depression of the rising\r\nplebeian nobility, and this object was for a time attained; but the\r\nultimate result was a vast increase in the numbers and the power of\r\nthose who were opposed to the old patrician nobility, by the formation\r\nof a higher class, the only qualification for admission into which was\r\nwealth and intelligence. According to the old distinctions of rank it\r\nwas necessary that even a plebeian should have a pedigree; his father\r\nand grandfather must have been born free. Appius, when chosen for the\r\nfirst time, waived this, and introduced a new principle of political\r\nparty. Of this anti-aristocratic party Nævius was the literary\r\nrepresentative, and the vehement opponent of privileges derived from the\r\naccident of birth. His position, too, was calculated to provoke a man of\r\nbetter temper. He was a Roman citizen, but, as a native of a municipal\r\ntown, he did not possess the full franchise which he saw enjoyed by\r\nothers around him who were intellectually inferior to himself, and the\r\nsense of his political inferiority was galling to him. Accordingly he\r\nused literature as a new and powerful instrument to foster the jealousy\r\nwhich existed between the orders of the state. He attacked the principle\r\nof an aristocracy of birth in the persons of some members of the most\r\ndistinguished families. He held up Scipio Africanus to ridicule by\r\nmaking him the hero of a tale of scandal.\r\n\r\n        Etiam qui res magnas manu gessit sæpe gloriose,\r\n        Cujus facta viva nunc vigent, qui apud gentes solas\r\n        Præstat, eum suus pater cum pallio una ab amica abduxit.\r\n\r\nThe public services of the two Metelli could not shield them from the\r\npoet’s bitterness, which attributed their consulships not to their own\r\nmerits, but to the mere will of fate.[132] One bitter sentence, “Fato\r\nMetelli Romæ fiunt consules.” made that powerful family his enemies. The\r\nMetellus, who at that time held the office of consul, threatened him\r\nwith vengeance for his slander in the following verse:—“Dabunt malum\r\nMetelli Nævio poetæ.” and the offending poet was indicted for a libel,\r\nin pursuance of a law of the Twelve Tables,[133] and thrown into prison.\r\nWhilst there he composed two pieces, in which he expressed contrition;\r\nand Plautus[134] describes him as watched by two jailers, pensively\r\nresting his head upon his hands:—\r\n\r\n            Nam os columnatum poetæ esse inaudivi barbaro,\r\n            Quoi bini custodes semper totis horis accubant.\r\n\r\nThrough the influence of the tribunes he was set at liberty.[135] As,\r\nhowever, is frequently the case, he could not resist indulging again in\r\nhis satiric vein, and he was exiled to Utica, where he died,[136] having\r\nemployed the last years of his life in writing his epic poem. The\r\nfollowing laudatory epitaph was written by himself:—\r\n\r\n       Mortales immortales flere si foret fas,\r\n       Flerent Divæ Camenæ Nævium poetam.\r\n       Itaque postquam est Orcino traditus thesauro\r\n       Obliti sunt Romani loquier Latinâ linguâ.\r\n\r\n       If gods might to a mortal pay the tribute of a tear,\r\n       The Muses would shed one upon the poet Nævius’ bier;\r\n       For when he was transferred unto the regions of the tomb,\r\n       The people soon forgot to speak the native tongue of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe best and most admired writers have paid their homage to his\r\nexcellence. Ennius and Virgil discovered in him such a freshness and\r\npower that they unscrupulously copied and imitated him, and transferred\r\nhis thoughts into their own poems as they did those of Homer. Horace\r\nwrites that in his day the poems of Nævius were universally read, and\r\nwere in the hands and hearts of everybody, and Cicero[137] praises him,\r\nalthough he had no taste for the old national literature.\r\n\r\nWe cannot be surprised at the universal popularity of Nævius. His stern\r\nlove of liberty, his unsparing opposition to aristocratic exclusiveness,\r\nwas identical with the old Roman republicanism. His taste for satire\r\nexactly fell in with the spirit of the earliest Roman literature, whilst\r\nhe depicted with life and vigour and graphic skill the scenes of heroism\r\nin which the soldier-poet of the first Punic War was himself an actor.\r\nHis tragedies were probably entirely taken from the Greek, but his\r\ncomedies had undoubted pretensions to originality. The titles of many of\r\nthem plainly show a Greek origin; but probably all more or less\r\npresented pictures of Roman life and manners, and therefore went home to\r\nthe hearts of the people. This is essential to the complete\r\neffectiveness of comedy. Tragedy appeals to higher feelings: it depicts\r\npassions and principles of action which are recognised by the whole\r\nhuman race; it may, therefore, enlist the sympathies on the side of\r\nthose whose habits and manners differ from our own, as it does in favour\r\nof those characters which are of a heroic and superhuman mould. Comedy\r\nprofesses to describe real life, and to paint men as they are; it\r\ntherefore loses part of its power unless it deals with scenes which the\r\nexperience of the audience can realize. Thus it is with painting. The\r\nhigh art of the Italian school, which selected for its subjects the holy\r\nscenes of religion, the heroism of history, and the creatures of\r\nclassical poetry, was fostered by the taste of the rich and noble\r\namongst a highly cultivated and imaginative people. The homely realities\r\nof the Flemish painters, with their accurate and lifelike delineations,\r\nwere the delight of a rude prosaic nation, who could not appreciate a\r\nmore elevated style or understand ideal beauties unless brought down to\r\nthe level of every-day life.\r\n\r\nThe new form with which Nævius invested comedy gave him scope for\r\nholding up to public scorn the prevailing vices and follies of the day.\r\nHe had also another vehicle for personality in his Ludi or Satiræ, as\r\nthey were termed by Cicero. These were comic scenes, and not regular\r\ndramas, somewhat resembling the Atellan farces, without their\r\nextemporaneous character. But his great work was his poem on the first\r\nPunic War. We cannot judge of its merits by the few fragments which\r\nremain; but the testimony borne to it by Cicero, and the use which was\r\nmade of it by Ennius and Virgil, prove that it fully deserved the title\r\nof an epic poem. The idea was original, the plot and characters Roman.\r\nThe author, although Greek literature taught him how to be a poet, drew\r\nhis inspiration from the scenes of his native Italy and the exploits of\r\nhis countrymen. To this poem Virgil owed that beautiful allegorical\r\nrepresentation of the undying enmity between Rome and Carthage, and the\r\ndisastrous love of Æneas and Dido. Here was first painted in such\r\ntouching colours the self-devoted patriotism of Regulus, whom (although\r\nlove of historic truth refuses to believe the legend) the poet\r\nrepresents as sacrificing home and wife and children to a sense of\r\nhonour, and as submitting to a torturing death for the sake of his\r\ncountry. Probably many other heart-stirring legends and tales of prowess\r\nwhich had cheered the nightly bivouac of the soldiers and inspirited\r\nthem in the field, were embodied in this popular epic. Not that he\r\ndisdained any more than Virgil the aid of Homer.[138] The second book of\r\nthe Iliad suggested to him the enumeration of the opposing forces at the\r\ncommencement of the struggle, and the description of the storm, from\r\nwhich Virgil, in his turn, copied in the Æneid,[139] owes much of its\r\nenergy to the eighth book of the Odyssey. The expostulation of Venus\r\nwith the father of gods and men,[140] respecting the perils of her son,\r\nand the promise of future prosperity to the descendants of Æneas, with\r\nwhich Jupiter consoles her, as well as the address of Æneas to his\r\ncompanions, are imitations of passages from this poem of Nævius; and\r\nEnnius copied so much from him and his predecessors as to have provoked\r\nthe following rebuke from Cicero:[141]—“They have written well, if not\r\nwith all thy elegance, and so oughtest thou to think who have borrowed\r\nso much from Nævius, if you confess that you have done so, or, if you\r\ndeny it, have stolen so much from him.”\r\n\r\nThe fragments of Nævius extant are not more numerous than those of\r\nLivius, but some are rather longer. The two following may be quoted as\r\nexamples of simplicity and power:—\r\n\r\n                              Amborum\r\n         Uxores noctu Troiad exibant capitibus\r\n         Opertis, flentes ambæ, abeuntes lacrymis multis.[142]\r\n\r\nThese few words tell their tale with as much pathos as that admired line\r\nin the Andrian of Terence—\r\n\r\n               Rejecit se in eum flens quam familiariter.\r\n\r\nThe following lines describe the panic of the Carthaginians; nor could\r\nany Roman poet have sketched the picture in fewer strokes or with more\r\nsuggestive power:—\r\n\r\n              Sic Poinei contremiscunt artibus universim;\r\n              Magnei metus tumultus pectora possidet\r\n              Cæsum funera agitant, exequias ititant,\r\n              Temulentiamque tollunt festam.[143]\r\n\r\nWhoever can forgive roughness of expression for the sake of vigorous\r\nthought, would, if more had remained, have read with delight the\r\ninartificial although unpolished poetry of Nævius. Without that\r\nelaborate workmanship which was to the Roman the only substitute for the\r\nspontaneous grace and beauty of all that proceeded from the Greek mind,\r\nand was expressed in the Greek tongue, there is no doubt that Nævius\r\ndisplayed genius, originality, and dignity. The prejudices of Horace in\r\nfavour of Greek taste were too strong for him to value what was old in\r\npoetry, or to sympathize with the admiration of that which the goddess\r\nof death had consecrated.[144] But Cicero, whilst he attributed to\r\nLivius only the mechanic skill and barbaric art of Dædalus, gave to\r\nNævius the creative talent and plastic power of Myron.\r\n\r\nEven when Roman critics were not unanimous in assigning him a niche\r\namongst the greatest bards, the Roman people loved him as their national\r\npoet, and were grateful to him for his nationality. They paid him the\r\nhighest compliment possible by retaining him as the educator of their\r\nyouth. Orbilius flogged his sentiments into his pupil’s memories; and,\r\nwhilst the niceties of grammar were taught through the instrumentality\r\nof Greek by Greek instructors, and poetic taste was formed by a study of\r\nthe Homeric poems, Nævius still had the formation of the character of\r\nthe young Roman gentlemen, and his epic was in the hands and hearts of\r\nevery one.\r\n\r\nOne more subject remains to be treated of with reference to the literary\r\nproductions of Nævius, and that is, the metrical character of his\r\npoetry. He appreciated that important element of Greek poetic beauty.\r\nThe varied versification by means of which it appeals at once to the\r\near, just as physical beauty charms long before we are attracted by the\r\nhidden power of moral excellence, and external form creates a prejudice\r\nin favour of that which is of more intrinsic value, but cannot so\r\nreadily be perceived, so the melody of verse more readily pleases than\r\nthe beauty of the imagery and sentiments which the verses convey.\r\nNævius, therefore, did not disdain to recommend his original genius by a\r\nstudy of the principles of Greek versification, and by clothing his\r\nthoughts in those which his ear suggested as being most appropriate to\r\nthe occasion. He does not seem to have overcome the difficulties of the\r\nheroic metre, although he studied the Homeric poems.\r\n\r\nProbably as the Saturnian, the only natural Italian measure which he\r\nfound existing, was a triple time, the Roman ear could not at once adapt\r\nitself to the common time of the dactylic measures. The versification of\r\nour own country furnishes an analogous example. The usual metres of\r\nEnglish poetry consist of an alternation of long and short syllables;\r\ndactyles and anapæsts are of less frequent occurrence and are of more\r\nmodern introduction, and the English ear is even yet not quite\r\naccustomed to the hexametrical rhythm. The dignity of the epic is\r\nexpressed in the grave march of the iambus; the ballad tells its story\r\nin the same metre, though in shorter lines; the joyous Anacreontic\r\nadopts the dancing step of the trochee. For this reason, perhaps,\r\nNævius, as a matter of taste, limited himself to the introduction of\r\niambic and trochaic metres, and the irregular features of Greek lyric\r\npoetry to the exclusion of the heroic hexameter.\r\n\r\nIt was long before the Romans could arrive at perfection in this metre.\r\nEnnius was unsuccessful. His hexameters are rough and unmusical; he\r\nseems never to have perfectly understood the nature and beauty of the\r\n_cæsura_ or pause. The failure of Cicero, notwithstanding his natural\r\nmusical ear, is proverbial. No one previous to Virgil seems to have\r\novercome the difficulty. Versification seems always to have been\r\nsomewhat of a labour to the Romans. In the structure of their poetry\r\nthey worked by rule; their finish was artistic, but it was artificial.\r\nHence the Latin poet allowed himself less metrical liberty than the\r\nGreek, whom he made his model. He seemed to feel that the Greek metres,\r\nwhich the education of his taste had compelled him to adopt, were not\r\nprecisely the form into which Latin words naturally fell; that this\r\ndeficiency must be supplied by the care with which he moulded his verse,\r\naccording to the strictest possible standard. One can imagine the\r\nextemporaneous effusions of a Homeric bard; but to Roman taste which, in\r\nevery literary work, especially in poetry, looked for elaborate finish,\r\nthe power of the improvisator, who could pour forth a hundred verses\r\nstanding on one foot, was a ridiculous pretension.[145]\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, no Roman poet attained facility in versification;\r\nOvid was perhaps the only exception. In the early period, when Roman\r\npoetry was extemporaneous, their national verse was only rhythmical, and\r\nnow that modern Italy can boast of the faculty of improvisation, verse\r\nhas become rhythmical again. But although Nævius introduced a variety of\r\nGreek metres to the Romans, the principal part of his poems, and\r\nespecially his national epic, were written in the old Saturnian measure:\r\nits structure was indeed less rude, and its metre more regular and\r\nscientific, but still he did not permit the new rules of Greek poetry to\r\nbanish entirely the favourite verses “in which in olden times Fauns and\r\nbards sung,” and which would most acceptably convey to the national ear\r\nthe achievements of Roman arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\nNÆVIUS STOOD BETWEEN TWO AGES—LIFE OF ENNIUS—EPITAPHS WRITTEN BY HIM—HIS\r\n    TASTE, LEARNING, AND CHARACTER—HIS FITNESS FOR BEING A LITERARY\r\n      REFORMER—HIS INFLUENCE ON THE LANGUAGE—HIS VERSIFICATION—THE\r\n ANNALS—DIFFICULTIES OF THE SUBJECT—TRAGEDIES AND COMEDIES—SATIRÆ—MINOR\r\n                                 WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ENNIUS (BORN B. C. 239.)\r\n\r\nNævius appears to have occupied a position between two successive ages;\r\nhe was the last of the oldest school of writers, and prepared the way\r\nfor a new one. Although a true Roman in sentiment, he admired Greek\r\ncultivation. He saw with regret the old literature of his country fading\r\naway, although he had himself introduced new principles of taste to his\r\ncountrymen. He was not prepared for the shock of seeing the old school\r\nsuperseded by the new. But still the period for this had arrived, and in\r\nhis epitaph, as we have seen, he deplored that Latin had died with him.\r\nA love for old Roman literature remained amongst the goatherds of the\r\nhills and the husbandmen of the valleys and plains, in whose memories\r\nlived the old songs which had been the delight of their infancy: it\r\nsurvived amongst the few who could discern merit in undisciplined\r\ngenius; but the rising generation, who owed their taste to education,\r\nadmired only those productions by which their taste had been formed.\r\nGreek literature had now an open field in which to flourish: it had\r\ndriven out its predecessor, although as yet it had not struck its roots\r\ndeeply into the Roman mind; a new school of poetry arose, and of that\r\nschool Ennius was the founder. The principal events in the life of\r\nEnnius are as follows:—he was born at the little village of Rudiæ, in\r\nthe wild and mountainous Calabria, B. C. 239.[146] Of ancient and\r\nhonourable descent,[147] he is said[148] to have begun life in a\r\nmilitary career, and to have risen to the rank of a centurion or\r\ncaptain. The anonymous author of the life of Cato, which is generally\r\nattributed to Cornelius Nepos, relates that Cato in his voyage from\r\nAfrica to Rome[149] visited Sardinia, and finding Ennius in that island\r\ntook him home with him. But no reason can be assigned why Ennius should\r\nhave been there, or why Cato should have gone so far out of his way. If\r\nthe Censor did really introduce the poet to public notice at Rome, he\r\nmay have made his acquaintance during his quæstorship in Africa, if\r\nEnnius was with Scipio in that province; or during his prætorship[150]\r\nin Sardinia, if the poet was a resident in that island. There exist,\r\nhowever, no sufficient data to clear up these difficulties.\r\n\r\nIt seems, moreover, strange that Cato should have been his patron, and\r\nyet that he should have reproached M. Fulvius Nobilior for taking the\r\npoet with him as his companion throughout his Ætolian expedition.[151]\r\nWith the exception of this campaign, Ennius resided during the remainder\r\nof his long life at Rome. Greek and Greek literature were now eagerly\r\nsought after by the higher classes, and Ennius earned a subsistence\r\nsufficient for his moderate wants by tuition. He enjoyed the friendship\r\nand esteem of the leading literary societies at Rome; and at his death,\r\nat the age of seventy, he was buried in the family tomb of the Scipios,\r\nat the request of the great conqueror of Hannibal, whose fame he\r\ncontributed to hand down to posterity. His statue was honoured with a\r\nniche amongst the images of that illustrious race. The following epitaph\r\nwas written by himself:—[152]\r\n\r\n             Adspicite, O cives, senis Enni imagini’ formam\r\n               Hic vostrum panxit maxima facta patrum.\r\n             Nemo me lacrymis decoret, nec funera fletu\r\n               Faxit. cur? volito vivu’ per ora virum.\r\n\r\nThe epitaph which he wrote in honour of Scipio Africanus has also been\r\npreserved:—[153]\r\n\r\n            Hic est ille situs, cui nemo civi’ neque hostis\r\n              Quivit pro factis reddere operæ pretium.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that death alone put a period to his career as a poet,\r\nand that his last work was completed but a short time before his\r\ndecease. So popular was he for centuries, and with such care were his\r\npoems preserved, that his whole works are said to have existed as late\r\nas the thirteenth century.[154]\r\n\r\nLiterature, as represented by Ennius, attained a higher social and\r\npolitical position than it had hitherto enjoyed. Livius Andronicus was,\r\nas we have seen, a freedman, and probably a prisoner of war. Nævius\r\nnever arrived at the full civic franchise, nor became anything more than\r\nthe native of a municipality, resident at Rome. Hitherto the Romans,\r\nalthough they had begun to admire learning, had not learned to respect\r\nits professors. Ennius was evidently a gentleman; he was the first to\r\nobtain for literature its due influence. Thus he achieved for himself\r\nthe much-coveted privileges of a Roman citizen, to which Livius had\r\nnever aspired, and which Nævius was never able to attain. Hence Cicero\r\nalways speaks of him with affection as a fellow-countryman. “Our own\r\nEnnius” is the appellation which he uses when he quotes his poetry.\r\nHorace also calls him “Father Ennius,” a term implying not only that he\r\nwas the founder of Latin poetry, but also reverence and regard.\r\n\r\nTo discriminating taste and extensive learning he added that versatility\r\nof talent which is displayed in the great variety of his compositions.\r\nHe was acquainted with all the best existing sources of poetic lore, the\r\nancient legends of the Roman people, and the best works of the Greek\r\nwriters; he had critical judgment to select beautiful and interesting\r\nportions, ingenuity to imitate them, and at the same time genius and\r\nfancy to clothe them with originality. It was not to be expected that he\r\ncould be entirely freed from the antiquated style of the old school. The\r\nprocess of remodelling a national literature, including the very\r\nlanguage in which it is expressed, and the metrical harmonies in which\r\nit falls upon the ear, is almost like reforming the modes of thought,\r\nand reconstructing the character of a people. Such a work must be\r\ngradual and gentle: a nation’s mind will not bend at once to new\r\nprinciples of taste and new rules of art. To attempt a violent\r\nrevolution would be absurd, and argue ignorance of human nature. The\r\npoet who attempted it would fail in gaining sympathy, which is an\r\nessential element of success. To cause such a revolution at all requires\r\na strong will and a vigorous manly mind; and these are precisely the\r\ncharacteristic features of the Ennian poetry.\r\n\r\nIf we were to paint the character best adapted to act the part of a\r\nliterary reformer to a nation such as the Romans were, it would be\r\nexactly that of Ennius. He was, like his friends Cato the Censor and\r\nScipio Africanus the elder, a man of action as well as philosophical\r\nthought. He was not only a poet, but he was a brave and stout-hearted\r\nsoldier. He had all the singleness of heart and unostentatious\r\nsimplicity of manners which marked the old times of Roman virtue; he\r\nlived the life of the Cincinnati, the Curii, and Fabricii, which the\r\npoets of the luxurious Augustan age professed to admire, but did not\r\nimitate. Rome was now beginning to be wealthy, and wealth to be the\r\nbadge of rank; yet the noble poet was respected by the rich and great,\r\neven in his lowly cottage on the Aventine, and found it no discredit to\r\nbe employed as an instructor of youth, although it had been up to his\r\ntime only the occupation of servants and freedmen. He was the founder of\r\na new school, and was leading his admirers forward to a new career; but\r\nhis imagination could revel in the recollections and traditions of the\r\npast. To him the glorious exploits of the patriarchs of his race\r\nfurnished as rich a mine of fable as the heroic strains of Homer, the\r\nmarvellous mythologies of Hesiod, and the tragic heroes of Argos, Mycenæ\r\nand Thebes. His early training in Greek philosophy and poetry, and in\r\nthe midst of Greek habits in his native village, had not polished and\r\nrefined away his natural freshness. He was a child of art, but a child\r\nof nature still. He had a firm belief in his mission as a poet, an\r\nabiding conviction of his inspiration. He thought he was not\r\nmetaphorically, but really, what Horace calls him, a second Homer,[155]\r\nfor that the soul of the great Greek bard now animated his mortal body.\r\nHe had all the enthusiasm and boldness necessary for accomplishing a\r\ngreat task, together with a consciousness that his task was a great and\r\nhonourable one.\r\n\r\nOwing to this rare union of the best points of Roman character with\r\nGreek refinement and civilization, he rendered himself as well as his\r\nworks acceptable to the most distinguished men of his day, and his\r\nintimacy and friendship influenced the minds of Porcius Cato, Lælius,\r\nFulvius Nobilior, and the great Scipio.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the extant specimens of the old Latin with the numerous\r\nfragments[156] of the poems of Ennius which have been preserved, will\r\nshow how deeply they were indebted to him for the improvement of their\r\nlanguage, not only in the harmony of its numbers and the convenience of\r\nits grammatical forms, but also in its copiousness and power.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that Ennius is to be praised, not only\r\nbecause he did so much, but because he refrained from doing more, as\r\nthough he designedly left an antiquated rudeness, redolent of the old\r\nRoman spirit and simplicity. A language in the condition or phase of\r\nimprovement to which he brought it is valuable in an antiquarian point\r\nof view; but it is not to be admired as if it were then in a higher\r\nstate of perfection than it afterwards attained. Elaborate polish may,\r\nperhaps, overcome life and freshness, but no one who possesses any\r\ncorrectness of ear or appreciation of beauty can prefer the limping\r\nhexameters of Ennius to the musical lines of Virgil, or his later style\r\nto the refined eloquence of the Augustan age. As Quintilian says, we\r\nvalue Ennius, not for the beauty of his style, but for his\r\npicturesqueness, and for the holiness, as it were, which consecrates\r\nantiquity, just as we feel a reverential awe when we contemplate the\r\nhuge gnarled fathers of the forest. “Ennium sicut sacros vetustate lucos\r\nadoremus in quibus grandia et antiqua robora, jam non tantam habent\r\nspeciem, quantam religionem.”\r\n\r\nHis predecessors had done little to remould the rude and undigested mass\r\nwhich, as has been shown, was made up of several elements, thrown\r\ntogether by the chance of war and conquest, and left to be amalgamated\r\ntogether by the natural genius of the people. Ennius naturally possessed\r\ngreat power over words, and wielded that power skilfully. In\r\nreconstructing the edifice he did the most important and most difficult\r\npart, although the result of his labours does not strike the eye as\r\nperfect and consummate. He laid the foundation strongly and safely. What\r\nhe did was improved upon, but was never undone. The taste of succeeding\r\nages erected on his basement an elegant and beautiful superstructure. To\r\nEnnius we owe the fact that after his time Latin literature was always\r\nadvancing until it reached its perfection. It never went back, because\r\nthe groundwork on which it was built was sound.\r\n\r\nEnnius imitated most of the Greek metrical forms; but he wrote verses\r\nlike a learner, and not like one imbued with the spirit of the metres\r\nwhich he imitated. He attended to the prosodiac rules of quantity, so\r\nfar as his observation deduced them from the analogies of the two\r\nlanguages, instead of the old Roman principle of ictus or stress; but,\r\nprovided the number of feet were correct, and the long and short\r\nsyllables followed each other in proper order, his ear was satisfied: it\r\nwas not as yet sufficiently in tune to appreciate those minuter\r\naccessaries which embellish later Latin versification. This is the\r\nprincipal cause of that ruggedness with which even the admirers of\r\nEnnius justly find fault. But notwithstanding these defects, there are\r\namongst his verses some as musical and harmonious as those of the best\r\npoets in the Augustan age.\r\n\r\nHis great epic poem, entitled “The Annals,” gained him the attachment as\r\nwell as the admiration of his countrymen. This poem, written in\r\nhexameters, a metre now first introduced to the notice of the Romans,\r\ndetailed in eighteen books the rise and progress of their national\r\nglory, from the earliest legendary periods down to his own times. The\r\nonly portion of history which he omitted was the first Punic war; and\r\nthe reason which he gives for the omission is that others have\r\nanticipated him[157]—alluding to his predecessors Livius and Nævius.\r\n\r\nThe subject which he proposed to himself was one of considerable\r\ndifficulty. The title and scope of his work compelled him to adopt a\r\nstrict chronological order instead of the principles of epic\r\narrangement, and to invest the truths which the course of history forced\r\nupon his acceptance with the interest of fiction. His subject could have\r\nno unity, no hero upon whose fortunes the principal interest should be\r\nconcentrated, and around whom the leading events should group\r\nthemselves. But still no history could be better adapted to his purpose\r\nthan that of his own country. Its early legends form a long series of\r\npoetical romances, fit to be sung in heroic numbers, although from being\r\noriginally unconnected with each other, incapable of being woven into\r\none epic story. Ennius had to unite in himself the characters of the\r\nhistorian and the poet—to teach what he believed to be truth, and yet to\r\nmove the feelings and delight the fancy by the embellishments of\r\nfiction. The poetical merit in which he must necessarily have been\r\ndeficient was the conduct of the plot; but the fragments of his poem are\r\nnot sufficiently numerous for us to discover this deficiency. They are,\r\nhowever, amply sufficient to show that he possessed picturesque power\r\nboth in sketching his narratives and in portraying his characters. His\r\nscenes are full of activity and animation; his characters seem to live\r\nand breathe; his sentiments are noble, and full of a healthful\r\nenthusiasm. His language is what that of an old Roman ought to be, such\r\nas we might have expected from Cato and Scipio had they been poets:\r\ndignified, chaste, severe, it rises as high as the most majestic\r\neloquence, although it does not soar to the sublimity of poetry.\r\n\r\nThe parts in which he approaches most nearly to his great model, or, as\r\nhe believed, the source of his inspiration, were in his descriptions of\r\nbattles. Here the martial spirit of the Roman warrior shines forth; the\r\nold soldier seems to revel in the scenes of his youth. The poem which\r\noccupied his declining years shows that it was his greatest pleasure to\r\nrecord the triumphs of his countrymen, and to teach posterity how their\r\nancestors had won so many glorious fields. His similes are simply\r\nimitations; they show that he had taste to appreciate the peculiar\r\nfeatures of the Homeric Poem; but as must be the case with mere\r\nimitations, they have not the energy which characterizes his battles.\r\n\r\nAs a dramatic poet, Ennius does not deserve a high reputation. A tragic\r\ndrama must be of native growth, it will not bear transplanting. The\r\nRomans did not possess the elements of tragedy; the genius of Ennius was\r\nnot able to remedy that defect, and he could do no more than select,\r\nwith the taste and judgment which he possessed, such Greek dramas as\r\nwere likely to be interesting. Probably, however, his tragedies never\r\nbecame popular; they were admired by the narrow literary circle in which\r\nhis private life was passed. Those who were familiar with the Greek\r\noriginals were delighted to see their favourites transferred into their\r\nnative language; those who were not, had their curiosity gratified, and\r\nwelcomed even these reflections of the glorious minds of Æschylus,\r\nSophocles, and Euripides.\r\n\r\nBut the tribute of admiration which the ancient classical authors paid\r\nto Ennius, was paid to him as an epic not as a dramatic poet. Cicero\r\nwhen he speaks in his praise generally quotes from the Annals, only once\r\nfrom a tragedy.[158] Virgil borrows lines and thoughts, together with\r\nthe commencement and conclusion of the same poem; and, although the fame\r\nof Ennius survived the decline of Roman tragedy, and flourished even in\r\nthe age of the Antonines,[159] and his verses were heard in the theatre\r\nof Puteoli (Pozzuoli,) the entertainment did not consist of one of his\r\ntragedies, but of recitations from his epic poem. Nevertheless his\r\ntragedies were very numerous, and the titles and some fragments of\r\ntwenty-three remain. They are all close imitations, or even\r\ntranslations, of the Greek. Of fifteen fragments of his Medea which are\r\nextant, there is not one which does not correspond with some passage in\r\nthe Medea of Euripides: the little which we have of his Eumenides is a\r\ntranscript from the tragedy of Æschylus;[160] and, according to A.\r\nGellius, his Hecuba is a clever translation likewise.\r\n\r\nHis favourite model was Euripides: nor is it surprising that he should\r\nhave been better able to appreciate the inferior excellencies of this\r\ndramatic poet, when we remember that the birth of Latin literature was\r\ncoincident with the decay of that of Greece. Callimachus died just as\r\nLivius began to write.[161] Theocritus expired when Ennius was\r\ntwenty-five years old;[162] and by this decaying living literature his\r\ntaste must have been partially educated and formed.\r\n\r\nIn comedy, as in tragedy, he never emancipated himself from the trammels\r\nof the Greek originals. His comedies were _palliatæ_; and Terence when\r\naccused of plagiarism defends himself by an appeal to the example of\r\nEnnius. Fragments are preserved of four only.\r\n\r\nThe poems which he wrote in various metres, and on miscellaneous\r\nsubjects, were, for that reason, entitled _Satiræ_ or _Saturæ_. Ennius\r\ndoes not, indeed, anticipate the claim of Lucilius to be considered the\r\nfather of Roman satire in its proper sense; but still there can be\r\nlittle doubt that the scope of these minor poems was the chastisement of\r\nvice. The degeneracy of Roman virtue, even in his days, provoked\r\nlanguage of Archilochian bitterness from so stern a moralist, although\r\nhe would not libellously attack those who were undeserving of censure.\r\nThe salutation which he addresses to himself expresses the burning\r\nindignation which he felt against wickedness:—\r\n\r\n                 Enni poeta salve qui mortalibus\r\n                 _Versus_ propinas flammeos medullitus.\r\n\r\nAmongst his minor works were epitaphs on Scipio and on himself, a\r\ndidactic poem, entitled Epicharmus, a collection of moral precepts, an\r\nencomium on his friend Scipio Africanus, a translation in hexameters of\r\na poem on edible fishes and their localities, by Archestratus\r\n(Phagetica,) and a work entitled Asotus, the existence of which is only\r\nknown from its being mentioned by Varro and Festus for the sake of\r\netymological illustration; by some it is thought to have been a comedy.\r\nThe idea that he was the author of a piece called “Sabinæ” is without\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nCicero[163] mentions a mythological work (Evemerus,) a translation in\r\ntrochaics of the Ἱερα Ἀναγραφη of the Sicilian writer who bore that\r\nname. It was a work well adapted to the talent which Ennius possessed of\r\nrelating mythical traditions, in the form of poetical history. The\r\ntheory embodied in the original was one which is often adopted by Livy\r\nin his early history, and therefore most probably entered into the\r\nancient legends, namely, that the gods were originally mighty warriors\r\nand benefactors of mankind, who, as their reward, were deified and\r\nworshipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n  THE NEW COMEDY OF THE GREEKS THE MODEL OF THE ROMAN—THE MORALITY OF\r\n   ROMAN COMEDY—WANT OF VARIETY IN THE PLOTS OF ROMAN COMEDY—DRAMATIS\r\n     PERSONÆ—COSTUME—CHARACTERS—MUSIC—LATIN PRONUNCIATION—METRICAL\r\n    LICENSES—CRITICISM OF VOLCATIUS—LIFE OF PLAUTUS—CHARACTER OF HIS\r\n                    COMEDIES—ANALYSIS OF HIS PLOTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that the dramatic taste of the Romans first\r\ndisplayed itself in the rudest species of comedy. The entertainment was\r\nextemporaneous, and performed by amateurs, and rhythmical only so far as\r\nto be consistent with these conditions. It was satirical, personal, full\r\nof burlesque extravagances, practical jokes, and licentious jesting.\r\nWhen it put on a more systematic form, by the introduction of music, and\r\nsinging, and dancing, and professional actors, still the Roman youth\r\nwould not give up their national amusement, and a marked distinction was\r\nmade in the social and political condition of the actor and the amateur.\r\nItalian comedy made no further progress, but on it was engrafted the\r\nGreek comedy, and hence arose that phase of the drama, the\r\nrepresentatives of which were Plautus, Cæcilius Statius, and Terence.\r\n\r\nNow the old Attic comedy consisted of either political or literary\r\ncriticism. In Italy, however, the Fescennine verses, and the farces of\r\nAtella, were not political, neither was there any literature to\r\ncriticise or to parody. But the personalities in which the people had\r\ntaken pleasure prepared them to enjoy the comedy of manners, embodying\r\nas it did pictures of social life. The new comedy, therefore, of the\r\nGreeks furnished a suitable model; and the comedies of Menander,\r\nDiphilus, Apollodorus, and others formed a rich mine of materials for\r\nadaptation or imitation.\r\n\r\nFrom them the Roman poet could derive much more than the “vis comica,”\r\nin which Cæsar complained that they were still so deficient. In the\r\nextant fragments of Menander may be found powerful delineations of human\r\npassions, especially of the pains and pleasures of love, melancholy but\r\ntrue views of the vanity of human hopes, elevated moral sentiments, and\r\nnoble ideas of the divine nature. A vein of temperate and placid\r\ngentleness, intermingled with amiable pleasantry, pervaded the comedies\r\nof Philemon, and his sentiments are tender and serious, without being\r\ngloomy. These good qualities recommended them to Chrysostom, Eustathius,\r\nand other early Christians, by whom so many of their fragments have been\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the comic, as well as the tragic poet of Greece,\r\nconsidered himself as a public instructor; but it is difficult to say\r\nhow far the Roman author recognised a moral object, because it cannot be\r\ndetermined what moral sentiments were designedly introduced, and what\r\nwere merely transcriptions from the original. It is plain, however, that\r\nRoman comedy was calculated to produce a moral result, although the\r\nmorality which it inculcated was extremely low: its standard was merely\r\nworldly prudence, its lessons utilitarian, its philosophy, like that of\r\nMenander himself, Epicurean, and therefore it did not inculcate an\r\nunbending sense of honour, the self-denying heroism of the Stoic school,\r\nor that rigid Roman virtue which was akin to it—it contented itself with\r\nencouraging the benevolent affections.\r\n\r\nIt did not profess to reform the knave, except by showing him that\r\nknavery was not always successful. It taught that cunning must be met\r\nwith its own weapons, and that the qualities necessary for the conflict\r\nwere wit and sharpness. The union between the moral and the comic\r\nelement was exhibited in making intrigue successful wherever the victim\r\nwas deserving of it, and in representing him as foiled by accidents and\r\ncross-purposes, because the prudence and caution of the knave are not\r\nalways on a par with his cunning. It also had its sentimental side, and\r\nthe sympathies of the audience were enlisted in favour of good temper,\r\naffection, and generosity.\r\n\r\nBut the new Attic comedy presented a truthful portraiture of real native\r\nlife. This was scarcely ever the case with the Romans; the plots,\r\ncharacters, localities, and political institutions, were all Greek, and\r\ntherefore it can only be said that the whole was in perfect harmony and\r\nconsistency with Roman modes of thinking and acting. The comedies of\r\nPlautus probably, as will be seen hereafter, form the only exception.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that there is a want of variety in the plots of\r\nRoman comedy;[164] but this defect is owing to the political and social\r\ncondition of ancient Greece. Greece and the neighbouring countries were\r\ndivided into numerous independent states; its narrow seas were, even\r\nmore than they are now, infested with pirates, who had their nests and\r\nlurking-places in the various unfrequented coasts and islands; and\r\nslaves were an article of merchandise. Many a romantic incident\r\ntherefore occurred, such as is found in comedy. A child would be stolen,\r\nsold as a slave, educated in all the accomplishments which would fit her\r\nto be an _Hetæra_, engage the affections of some young Athenian, and\r\neventually, from some jewels or personal marks, be recognised by her\r\nparents, and restored to the rank of an Athenian citizen.\r\n\r\nAgain, in order to confine the privilege of citizenship, marriages with\r\nforeigners were invalid, and this restriction on marriage caused the\r\n_Hetæra_ to occupy so prominent a part in comedy; besides, love was\r\nlittle more than sensual passion, and marriage generally a matter of\r\nconvenience: the Hetæræ, too, were often clever and accomplished, whilst\r\nthe virtuous matron was fitter for the duties of domestic life than for\r\nsociety. The regulations of the Greek theatre also, which were adopted\r\nby the Romans, caused some restrictions upon the variety of plots. In\r\ncomedy the scene represented the public street, in which Greek females\r\nof good character did not usually appear unveiled: matrons, nurses, and\r\nwomen of light character alone are introduced upon the stage, and in all\r\nthe plays of Terence, except the Eunuch, the heroine is never seen.\r\n\r\nAs the range of subjects is small, so there is a sameness in the\r\ndramatis personæ: the principal characters are a morose and\r\nparsimonious, or a gentle and easy father, who is sometimes, also, the\r\nhenpecked husband of a rich wife, an affectionate or domineering wife, a\r\nyoung man who is frank and good-natured but profligate, a grasping or\r\nbenevolent Hetæra, a roguish servant, a fawning favourite, a hectoring\r\ncoward, an unscrupulous procuress, and a cold calculating slave-dealer.\r\n\r\nThe actors wore appropriate masks, sometimes partial, sometimes covering\r\nthe whole face, the features of which were not only grotesque, but much\r\nexaggerated and magnified. This was rendered absolutely necessary by the\r\nimmense size of the theatre, the stage of which sometimes measured sixty\r\nyards, and which would contain many thousands of spectators; the mouth,\r\nalso, answered the purpose of a sounding board, or speaking-trumpet to\r\nassist in conveying the voice to every part of the vast building. The\r\ncharacters, too, were made known by a conventional costume: old men wore\r\nample robes of white; young men were attired in gay parti-coloured\r\nclothes; rich men in purple; soldiers in scarlet; poor men and slaves in\r\ndark-coloured and scanty dresses.\r\n\r\nThe names assigned to the characters of the Roman comedy have always an\r\nappropriate meaning. Young men, for example, are Pamphilus, “dear to\r\nall;” Charinus, “gracious;” Phædria, “joyous:” old men are Simo,\r\n“flat-nosed,” such a physiognomy being considered indicative of a\r\ncross-grained disposition: Chremes, from a word signifying troubled with\r\nphlegm. Slaves generally bear the name of their native country, as\r\nSyrus, Phrygia; Davus, a Dacian; Byrrhia, a native of Pyrrha in Caria;\r\nDorias, a Dorian girl; a vain-glorious soldier is Thraso, from θρασος,\r\nboldness; a parasite, Gnatho, from γναθος, the jaw; a nurse, Sophrona\r\n(discreet;) a freedman, Sosia, as having been spared in war; a young\r\ngirl is Glycerium, from γλυκυς, sweet; a judge is Crito; a courtesan,\r\nChrysis, from χρυσος, gold. These examples will be sufficient to\r\nillustrate the practice adopted by the comic writers.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to understand the relation which music bore to the\r\nexhibition of Roman comedy. It is clear that there was always a musical\r\naccompaniment, and that the instruments used were flutes; the lyre was\r\nonly used in tragedy, because in comedy there was no chorus or lyric\r\nportion. The flutes were at first small and simple; but in the time of\r\nHorace were much larger and more powerful, as well as constructed with\r\nmore numerous stops and greater compass.[165]\r\n\r\nFlutes were of two kinds. Those played with the right hand (tibiæ\r\ndextræ) were made of the upper part of the reed, and like the modern\r\nfife or octave flute emitted a high sound: they were therefore suitable\r\nto lively and cheerful melodies; and this kind of music, known by the\r\nname of the Lydian mode, was performed upon a pair of tibiæ dextræ. The\r\nleft-handed flutes (tibiæ sinistræ) were pitched an octave lower: their\r\ntones were grave and fit for solemn music. The mode denominated Tyrian,\r\nor Sarrane,[166] was executed with a pair of tibiæ sinistræ. If the\r\nsubject of the play was serio-comic, the music was in the Phrygian mode,\r\nand the flutes used were _impares_ (unequal,) _i. e._, one for the\r\nright, the other for the left hand.[167] In tragedy the lyrical portion\r\nwas sung to music and the dialogue declaimed. But if that were the case\r\nin comedy, it is difficult to imagine what corresponded to the lyrical\r\nportion, and therefore where music was used. Quintilian informs us that\r\nscenic modulation was a simple, easy chant,[168] resembling probably\r\nintonation in our cathedrals. Such a practice would aid the voice\r\nconsiderably; and if so, the theory of Colman is probably correct, that\r\nthere was throughout some accompaniment, but that the music arranged for\r\nthe soliloquies (in which Terence especially abounds) was more laboured\r\nand complicated than that of the dialogue.[169]\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the principles which regulated the Roman comic\r\nmetres, some remarks must be made on the manner in which the language\r\nitself was affected by the common conversational pronunciation. In most\r\nlanguages there is a natural tendency to abbreviation and contraction.\r\nAs the object of language is the expression of thought, few are inclined\r\nto take more trouble or to expend more time than is absolutely necessary\r\nfor conveying their meaning: this attention to practical utility and\r\nconvenience is the reason for all elliptical forms in grammatical\r\nconstructions, and also for all abbreviated methods of pronunciation by\r\nslurring or clipping, or, to use the language of grammarians, by\r\napocope, syncope, synæresis, or crasis.\r\n\r\nThe experience of every one proves how different is the impression which\r\nthe sound of a foreign language makes upon the ear, when spoken by\r\nanother, from what it makes upon the eye when read even by one who is\r\nperfectly acquainted with the theory of pronunciation. Until the ear is\r\nhabituated, it is easier for an Englishman to speak French than to\r\nunderstand it when spoken. If we consider attentively the manner in\r\nwhich we speak our own language, it is astonishing how many letters and\r\neven syllables are slurred over and omitted: the accented syllable is\r\nstrongly and firmly enunciated, the rest, especially in long words, are\r\nleft to take care of themselves, and the experience of the hearer and\r\nhis acquaintance with the language find no difficulty in supplying the\r\ndeficiency. This is universally the case, except in careful and\r\ndeliberate reading, and in measured and stately declamation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the classical languages, the foregoing observations hold\r\ngood; in a slighter degree, indeed, with respect to the Greek, for the\r\ndelicacy of their ear, their attention to accent and quantity, not only\r\nin poetry but in oratory, and even in conversation, caused them to give\r\ngreater effect to every syllable, and especially to the vowel sounds.\r\nBut even in Greek poetry elision sometimes prevents the disagreeable\r\neffect of a hiatus, and in the transition from the one dialect to the\r\nother, the numerous vowels of the Ionic assume the contracted form of\r\nthe Attic.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance between the practice of the Romans and that of modern\r\nnations is very remarkable; with them the mark of good taste was\r\nease—the absence of effort, pedantry, and affectation. As they\r\nprincipally admired facility in versification, so they sought it in\r\npronunciation likewise. To speak with mouthing (hiulce,) with a broad\r\naccent (late, vaste,) was to speak like a clown and not like a gentleman\r\n(rustice et inurbaniter.) Cicero[170] admired the soft, gentle, equable\r\ntones of the female voice, and considered the pronunciation of the\r\neloquent and cultivated Lælia as the model of purity and perfection: he\r\nthought that she spoke as Plautus or Nævius might have spoken. Again, he\r\nspeaks of the habit which Cotta had of omitting the iota; pronouncing,\r\nfor example, dominus, dom’nus, as a prevalent fashion; and although he\r\nsays,[171] that such an _obscuration_ argues negligence, he, on the\r\nother hand, applies to the opposite fault a term (putidius) which\r\nimplies the most offensive affectation. From these observations, we must\r\nexpect to find that Latin as it was pronounced was very different from\r\nLatin as it is written; that this difference consisted in abbreviation\r\neither by the omission of sounds altogether, or by contraction of two\r\nsounds into one; and that these processes would take place especially in\r\nthose syllables which in poetry are not marked by the ictus or beat, or\r\nin common conversation by the stress or emphasis. Even in the more\r\nartificial poetry and oratory of the Augustan age, in which quantity was\r\nmore rigidly observed by the Roman imitators than by the Greek\r\noriginals, we find traces of this tendency; and Virgil does not hesitate\r\nto use in his stately heroics such forms as aspris, for asperis,\r\nsemustum for semiustum, oraclum for oraculum, maniplus for manipulus;\r\nand, like Terence, to make rejicere (rēīcĕrĕ) a dactyle.[172] A number\r\nof the most common words, sanctioned by general usage, and incorporated\r\ninto the language when in its most perfect state, were contractions—such\r\nas amassent for amavissent, concio for conventio, cogo from con and ago,\r\nsurgo from sub and rego, malla for maxilla, pomeridianus from\r\npost-mediam-diem, and other instances too numerous to mention.\r\n\r\nBut in the earlier periods, when literature was addressed still more to\r\nthe ear than to the eye, when the Greek metres were as yet unknown, and\r\neven when, after their introduction, exact observation of Greek rules\r\nwas not yet necessary, we find, as might be expected, these principles\r\nof the language carried still further. They pervade the poems of Livius\r\nand Ennius, and the Roman tragedies, even although their style is\r\nnecessarily more declamatory than that of the comic writers; but in the\r\nlatter we have a complete representation of Latin as it was commonly\r\npronounced and spoken, and but little trammelled or confined by a rigid\r\nadhesion to the Greek metrical laws. In the prologues, indeed, which are\r\nof the nature of declamation, and not of free and natural conversation,\r\nmore care is visible; the iambic trimeters in which they are written\r\nfall upon the ear with a cadence similar to those of the Greek, with\r\nscarcely any license except an occasional spondee in the even places.\r\nBut in the scenes little more seems to have been attended to, than that\r\nthe verse should have the required number of feet, and the syllables\r\npronounced the right quantity, in accordance with the widest license\r\nwhich the rules of Greek prosody allowed. What syllables should be\r\nslurred, was left to be decided by the common custom of pronunciation.\r\n\r\nBesides the licenses commonly met with in the poets of the Augustan age,\r\nthe following mutilations are the most usual in the poetical language of\r\nthe age of which we are treating:—\r\n\r\n1. The final _s_ might be elided even before a consonant, and hence the\r\npreceding vowel was made short: thus mălīs became mali, on the same\r\nprinciple that in Augustan poetry aūdīsnĕ was contracted into audĭn’.\r\nThus the short vowel would suffer elision before another, and the\r\nfollowing line of Terence would consequently be thus scanned:—\r\n\r\n     Ut mă | līs gāŭ | dēat ălĭ | ēn’ ātq’. | ēx ĭn | cōmmö | dīs.\r\n\r\n2. Vowels and even consonants were slurred over; hence Liberius became\r\nLib’rius; Adolescens, Ad’lescens; Vehemens, Vemens; Voluptas, V’luptas\r\n(like the French voila, v’la;) meum, eum, suum, siet, fuit, Deos, ego,\r\nille, tace, became monosyllables; and facio, sequere, &c., dissyllables.\r\n\r\n3. _M_ and _D_ were syncopated in the middle of words: thus enimvero\r\nbecame en’vero; quidem and modo qu’en and mo’o, circumventus,\r\ncirc’ventus.\r\n\r\n4. Conversely _d_ was added to me, te, and se, when followed by a vowel,\r\nas Reliquit med homo, &c., and in Plautus, med erga.\r\n\r\nObservations of such principles as these enable us to reduce all the\r\nmetres of Terence, and nearly all of Plautus, to iambic and trochaic,\r\nespecially to iambic senarii and trochaic tetrameters. Many of those\r\nwhich defy the attempt have become, by the injudicious treatment of\r\ntranscribers or commentators, wrongly arranged: for example, one of four\r\nlines in the Andria of Terence, which has always proved a difficulty,\r\nmight be thus arranged:—\r\n\r\n          Innā | tă cuī | quām tānt’ | ūt siēt | vēcōr | dĭa;\r\n\r\ninstead of the usual unmanageable form—\r\n\r\n     Tanta vecordia innata cuiquam ut siet.\r\n                                                    _Andr._ iv. 1.\r\n\r\nVolcatius Sedigitus, a critic and grammarian, assigns an order of merit\r\nto the authors of Roman comedy in the following passage:—\r\n\r\n     Multos incertos certare hanc rem vidimus\r\n     Palmam poetæ comico cui deferant.\r\n     Eum, me judice, errorem dissolvam tibi;\r\n     Ut contra si quis sentiat, nihil sentiat.\r\n     Cæcilio palmam Statio do comico.\r\n     Plautus secundus facile exsuperat cæteros.\r\n     Dein Nævius qui servet pretium, tertius est.\r\n     Si erit, quod quarto dabitur Licinio.\r\n     Post insequi Licinium facio Atilium.\r\n     In sexto sequitur hos loco Terentius.\r\n     Turpilius septimum, Trabea octavum obtinet;\r\n     Nono loco esse facile facio Luscium.\r\n     Decimum addo causa antiquitatis Ennium.\r\n                              _Volc. Sedig. ap. Gel._ lib. xv. 24.\r\n\r\nHowever correct this judgment may be, Plautus is the oldest, if not the\r\nmost celebrated of those who have not as yet been mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PLAUTUS.\r\n\r\nT. Maccius Plautus was a contemporary of Ennius, for it is generally\r\nsupposed that he was born twelve years later,[173] and died fifteen\r\nyears earlier[174] than the founder of the new school of Latin poetry.\r\nThe flourishing period, therefore, of both coincide. He was a native of\r\nSarsina, in Umbria, but was very young when he removed to Rome. Very\r\nlittle is known respecting his life; but it is universally admitted that\r\nhe was of humble origin, and owing to the prevalence of this tradition\r\nwe find _Plautinæ prosapiæ homo_, used as a proverbial expression. The\r\nnumerous examples in his comedies of vulgar taste and low humour are in\r\nfavour of this supposition.\r\n\r\nHe had no early gentlemanlike associations to interfere with his\r\ndelineations of Roman character in low life. His contemporary, Ennius,\r\nwas a gentleman; Plautus was not: education did not overcome his\r\nvulgarity, although it produced a great effect upon his language and\r\nstyle, which were more refined and cultivated than those of his\r\npredecessors. Plautus must have lived and associated with the class\r\nwhose manners he describes; hence his pictures are correct and truthful.\r\n\r\nThe class from which his representations of Roman life was taken is that\r\nof the _ærarii_, who consisted of clients, the sons of freedmen, and the\r\nhalf-enfranchised natives of Italian towns. His plots are Greek, his\r\npersonages Greek, and the scene is laid in Greece and her colonies; but\r\nthe morality, manners, sentiments, wit, and humour, were those of that\r\nmixed, half-foreign, class of the inhabitants of the capital, which\r\nstood between the slave and the free-born citizen. One of his characters\r\nis, as was observed by Niebuhr,[175] not Roman, for the parasite is a\r\nGreek, not a Roman character; but then a flatterer is by profession a\r\ncitizen of the world, and his business is to conform himself to the\r\nmanners of every society. How readily that character became naturalized,\r\nwe are informed by some of the most amusing passages in the satires of\r\nHorace and Juvenal.\r\n\r\nThe humble occupation which his poverty compelled him to follow was\r\ncalculated to draw out and foster the comic talent for which he was\r\nafterwards distinguished, for Varro[176] tells us that he acted as a\r\nstage-carpenter (_operarius_) to a theatrical company; he adds, also,\r\nthat he was subsequently engaged in some trade in which he was\r\nunsuccessful, and was reduced to the necessity of earning his daily\r\nbread by grinding in a mill. To this degrading labour, which was not\r\nusually performed by men, except as a punishment for refractory slaves,\r\nit has been supposed that he owed his cognomen, Asinius, which is\r\nsometimes appended to his other names. Ritzschl, however, has most\r\ningeniously and satisfactorily proved that the name of Asinius is a\r\ncorruption of Sarsinas (native of Sarsina:) he supposes that Sarsinas\r\nbecame Arsinas, that this was afterwards written Arsin, then Asin, and\r\nthat this was finally considered as the representative of Asinius.\r\n\r\nThis view is further supported by the fact that, in all cases in which\r\nthe name Asinius is used, the poet is called not Asinius Plautus, but\r\nPlautus Asinius, like Livius Patavinus, this being the proper position\r\nfor the ethnic name. Another error respecting the poet’s name has been\r\nperpetuated throughout all the editions of his works, although it is not\r\nfound in any manuscript. It was discovered by Ritzschl[177] whilst\r\nexamining the palimpsest MS. in the Ambrosian Library at Milan. He thus\r\nfound that his real names were Titus Maccius, and not Marcus Accius. The\r\nname Plautus was given him because he had flat feet, this being the\r\nsignification of the word in the Umbrian language. Niebuhr,[178]\r\nalthough he does not deny his poverty, gives no credit to the story of\r\nhis working at a mill.\r\n\r\nThe earliest comedies which he wrote are said to have been entitled\r\n“Addictus,” and “Saturio,” but they are not contained amongst the twenty\r\nwhich are now extant. As soon as he became an author there can be no\r\ndoubt that he emerged from his state of poverty and obscurity, for he\r\nhad no rival during his whole career, unless Cæcilius Statius, a man of\r\nvery inferior talent, can be considered one. Comedies began now to be in\r\ngreat demand: the taste for the comic drama was awakened; it was\r\nprecisely the sort of literature likely to be acceptable to an active,\r\nbustling, observant people like the Romans. They liked shows of every\r\nkind, and public speaking, and had always their eyes and their ears\r\nopen, loved jokes and rude satire and boisterous mirth, and would\r\nappreciate bold and fearless delineations of character, which they met\r\nwith in their every-day life. The demand for the public games,\r\ntherefore, began to be quite as great as the supply, and the theatrical\r\nmanagers would take care always to have a new play in rehearsal, in case\r\nthey should be called upon for a public representation.\r\n\r\nPlautus had no aristocratic patrons, like Ennius and Terence—probably\r\nhis humour was too broad, and his taste not refined enough, to please\r\nthe Scipios and Lælii, and their fastidious associates. Horace finds\r\nfault with Plautus because his wit was not sufficiently gentlemanlike,\r\nas well as his numbers not sufficiently harmonious. Probably the higher\r\nclasses might have observed similar deficiencies; with the masses,\r\nhowever, the comedies of Plautus, notwithstanding their faults, retained\r\ntheir original popularity even in the Augustan age. The Roman public\r\nwere his patrons. His very coarseness would recommend him to the rude\r\nadmirers of the Fescennine songs and the Atellan _Fabulæ_. His careless\r\nprosody and inharmonious verses would either escape the not over-refined\r\nears of his audience, or be forgiven for the sake of the fun which they\r\ncontained. Life, bustle, surprise, unexpected situations, sharp,\r\nsprightly, brilliant, sparkling raillery, that knew no restraint nor\r\nbounds, carried the audience with him. He allowed no respite, no time\r\nfor dulness or weariness. To use an expression of Horace, he hurried on\r\nfrom scene to scene, from incident to incident, from jest to jest, so\r\nthat his auditors had no opportunity for feeling fatigue.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of his popularity was, that although Greek was the\r\nfountain from which he drew his stores, and the metres of Greek poetry\r\nthe framework in which he set them, his wit, his mode of thought, his\r\nlanguage, were purely Roman. He had lived so long amongst Romans that he\r\nhad caught their national spirit, and this spirit was reflected\r\nthroughout his comedies. The incidents of them might have taken place in\r\nthe streets of Rome, so skilful was he in investing them with a Roman\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nHis style too was truly Latin, and Latin of the very purest and most\r\nelegant kind.[179] He did not, like Cato and Ennius, carry his\r\nadmiration for Greek so far as to “enrich” his native tongue with new\r\nand foreign words. Nor would this feature be without some effect in\r\ngaining him the sympathy of the masses. They admire elegance of language\r\nif it is elegant simplicity. They appreciate well-chosen and\r\nwell-arranged sentences, if the words are such as fall familiarly, and,\r\ntherefore, intelligibly on their ears.\r\n\r\nThe coarseness of Plautus, however, was the coarseness of innuendo, and\r\neven if the allusion was indelicate, it was veiled in decent language.\r\nThis quality of his wit called forth the approbation of Cicero.[180] But\r\nit is difficult to conceive how he could compare him, in this\r\nparticular, with the old Athenian comedy, the obscenity of which is so\r\ngross and palpable, as to constitute the sole blemish of those\r\ndelightful compositions.\r\n\r\nThe following laudatory epigram written by Varro is found in the Noctes\r\nAtticæ of A. Gellius:[181]—\r\n\r\n           Postquam est mortem aptus Plautus, comœdia luget,\r\n           Scena est deserta dein risus ludu, jocusque,\r\n           Et numeri innumeri simul omnes collacrumarunt.\r\n\r\nThe same grammarian paid to his style a compliment similar to that which\r\nhad been paid to Plato, by saying, that if the Muses spoke in Latin they\r\nwould borrow the language of Plautus.[182] Whatever might have been the\r\nfaults of the Plautian comedy, it maintained its position on the Roman\r\nstage for at least five centuries, and was acted as late as the reign of\r\nDioclesian.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Plautus ever attained the full privileges of a\r\nRoman citizen. Probably he had no powerful friends to press his claims,\r\nand therefore enjoyed no more than the Italian franchise to the end of\r\nhis days. No fewer than one hundred and thirty comedies have been\r\nattributed to him, but of these many were spurious. Varro considers the\r\ntwenty which are now extant genuine, together with the Vidularia, of\r\nwhich only a few lines remain, and those only in the palimpsest MS.\r\nalready mentioned. The rest, the titles of which alone survive, are of\r\ndoubtful authority.\r\n\r\nAll the comedies of Plautus, except the _Amphitruo_, were adapted from\r\nthe new comedy of the Greeks. The statement that he imitated the\r\nSicilian Epicharmus,[183] and founded the _Menæchmi_ on one of his\r\ncomedies, rests only on a vague tradition. There can be no doubt that he\r\nstudied also both the old and the middle comedy; but still Menander,\r\nDiphilus, and Philemon furnished him the originals of his plots. The\r\npopularity of Plautus was not confined to Rome, either republican or\r\nimperial. Dramatic writers of modern times have recognised the\r\neffectiveness of his plots, and, therefore, have adopted or imitated\r\nthem, and they have been translated into most of the European languages.\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief sketch of the subjects of his extant comedies.\r\n\r\nI. Amphitruo. This is the only piece which Plautus borrowed from the\r\nmiddle Attic comedy; the plot is founded on the well-known story of\r\nJupiter and Alcmena, and has been imitated both by Molière and Dryden.\r\n\r\nII., III., IV. The Asinaria, Casina, and Mercator, depict a state of\r\nmorals so revolting that it is impossible to dwell upon them.\r\n\r\nV. In the Aulularia, a very amusing play, a miser finds a pot of gold\r\n(aulula,) and hides it with the greatest care. His daughter is demanded\r\nin marriage by an old man named Megadorus, the principal recommendation\r\nto whose suit is, that he is willing to take her without a dowry.\r\nMeanwhile the slave of her young lover steals the gold, and, as may be\r\nconjectured, for no more of the play is preserved, the lover restores\r\nthe gold, and the old man, in the joy of his heart, gives him his\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nThis comedy suggested to Molière the plot of L’Avare, the best play\r\nwhich he ever wrote, and one in which he far surpasses the original. Two\r\nattempts have been made to supply the lost scenes, which may be found in\r\nthe Delphin and Variorum edition.\r\n\r\nVI. The Bacchides are two twin sisters, one of whom is beloved by her\r\nsister’s lover. He does not know that there are two, and, misled by the\r\nsimilarity of the name, thinks himself betrayed. Hence arise amusing\r\nsituations and incidents, but at length an éclaircissement takes place.\r\n\r\nVII. The Captivi, for its style, sentiments, moral, and the structure of\r\nthe plot, is incomparably the best comedy of Plautus. In a war between\r\nthe Ætolians and Eleians, Philopolemus, an Ætolian, the son of Hegio, is\r\ntaken prisoner, whilst Philocrates is captured by the Ætolians.\r\nPhilocrates and his slave Tyndarus are purchased by Hegio, with a view\r\nto recover his son by an exchange of prisoners. The master and slave,\r\nhowever, agree to change places; and thus Philocrates is sent back to\r\nhis country, valued only as a slave. Hegio discovers the trick, and\r\ncondemns Tyndarus to fetters and hard labour. Philocrates, however,\r\nreturns, and brings back Philopolemus with him, and it also turns out\r\nthat Tyndarus is a son of Hegio whom he had lost in his infancy.\r\n\r\nVIII. The Curculio derives its name from a parasite, who is the hero,\r\nand who acts his part in a plot full of fraud and forgery; the only\r\nsatisfactory point in the comedy being the deserved punishment of an\r\ninfamous pander.\r\n\r\nIX. In the Cistellaria, Demipho, a Lemnian, promises his daughter to\r\nAlcesimarchus, who is in love with Silenium. The young lady has fallen\r\ninto the hands of a courtesan, who endeavours to force her into a\r\nvicious course of life; she, however, steadily refuses; and it is at\r\nlength discovered, by means of a box of toys (cistella,) that she is the\r\nillegitimate daughter of Demipho, and had been exposed as an infant. Her\r\nvirtue is rewarded by her being happily married to her lover.\r\n\r\nX. The Epidicus was evidently a favourite play with the author, for he\r\nmakes one of the characters in another comedy say that he loves it as\r\ndearly as himself.[184] The plot turns on the common story of a lost\r\nchild recognised. The intrigue, which is remarkably clever, is managed\r\nby Epidicus, a cunning slave, who gives the name to the play.\r\n\r\nXI. The Mostellaria is exceedingly lively and amusing. A young man, in\r\nhis father’s absence, makes the paternal mansion a scene of noisy and\r\nextravagant revelry. In the midst of it the father returns, and in order\r\nto prevent discovery, a slave persuades him that the house is haunted.\r\nWhen he discovers the trick he is very angry, but ultimately pardons\r\nboth his son and the slave. The name is derived from Mostellum, the\r\ndiminutive of Monstrum, a prodigy, or supernatural visitor.\r\n\r\nXII. The Menæchmi is a Comedy of Errors, arising out of the exact\r\nlikeness between two brothers, one of whom was stolen in infancy, and\r\nthe other wanders in search of him, and at last finds him in great\r\naffluence at Epidamnus. It furnished the plot to Shakspeare’s play, and\r\nlikewise to the comedy of Regnard, which bears the name of the original.\r\n\r\nXIII. The Miles Gloriosus was taken from the Ἀλαζων (Boaster) of the\r\nGreek comic drama. Its hero, Pyrgopolinices, is the model of all the\r\nblustering, swaggering captains of ancient and modern comedy. The\r\nbraggadocio carries off the mistress of a young Athenian, who follows\r\nhim, and takes up his abode in the next house to that in which the girl\r\nis concealed. Like Pyramus and Thisbe the lovers have secret interviews\r\nthrough a hole in the party-wall. (The device being borrowed from the\r\n“Phantom” of Menander.)[185] When they are discovered, the soldier is\r\ninduced to resign the lady by being persuaded that another is\r\ndesperately in love with him, but the only reward which he gets is a\r\ngood beating for his pains.\r\n\r\nXIV. In the Pseudolus, a cunning slave of that name procures, by a false\r\nmemorandum, a female slave for his young master; and when the fraud is\r\ndiscovered the matter is settled by the payment of the price by a\r\ncomplaisant father. Notwithstanding the simplicity of the plot, the\r\naction is bustling and full of intrigue; and from a passage of\r\nCicero,[186] it appears that this play and Truculentus were favourites\r\nwith the author himself. The procurer in this comedy was one of the\r\ncharacters in which Roscius especially excelled.\r\n\r\nXV. The Pœnulus derives its name from its romantic plot. A young\r\nCarthaginian slave is adopted by an old bachelor, who leaves him a good\r\ninheritance. He falls in love with a girl, a Carthaginian like himself,\r\nwho had been kidnapped with her sister, and now belonged to a procurer.\r\nThe arrival of the father leads to a discovery that they are free-born,\r\nand that they are the first cousins of the young man. Thus it comes to\r\npass that the girls are rescued, and the lovers united. The most curious\r\nportion of this comedy is that in which Hanno, the father, is\r\nrepresented as talking Punic;[187] and his words bear so close a\r\nresemblance to the Hebrew that commentators have expressed them in\r\nHebrew characters, and rendered them, after a few emendations, capable\r\nof translation.[188]\r\n\r\nXVI. The tricks played upon a procurer by a slave, aided by a Persian\r\nparasite, furnish the slender plot of the Persa.\r\n\r\nXVII. The Rudens derives its name from the rope of a fishing-net, and,\r\nwith the exception perhaps of the Captivi, is the most affecting and\r\npleasing of all the twenty plays. The morality is pure, the sentiments\r\nelevated, the poetic justice complete. A female child has fallen into\r\nthe hands of a procurer. Her lover in vain endeavours to ransom her, and\r\nbeing shipwrecked, the toys with which she played in infancy are lost in\r\nthe waves, but are eventually brought to shore by the net of a\r\nfisherman. She is thus recognised by her father, and is married to her\r\nlover, whilst the procurer is utterly ruined by the loss of his property\r\nin the wreck.\r\n\r\nXVIII. Stichus is the name of the slave on whom the intrigue of the play\r\nwhich bears this name mainly depends. The plot is very simple. Two\r\nbrothers marry two sisters, and are ruined by extravagant living; they\r\ndetermine therefore to go abroad and repair their fortunes. After they\r\nhave been many years absent the ladies’ father wishes them to marry\r\nagain. They, however, steadily refuse, and their constancy is rewarded\r\nby the return of their husbands with large fortunes.\r\n\r\nXIX. The Trinummus is a translation from the Thesaurus of the Greek\r\ncomic poet Philemon.[189] It derived its Latin title from the incident\r\nof the informer being bribed with three _nummi_.[190] An old merchant on\r\nleaving home places his son and daughter, together with a treasure which\r\nhe has buried in his house, under the guardianship of his friend\r\nCallicles. The son squanders his father’s property, and is even forced\r\nto sell his house, which Callicles purchases. Soon a young man of good\r\nfamily and fortune makes proposals for the daughter’s hand, and\r\nCallicles is at a loss to know how to give her a dowry without saying\r\nsomething about the treasure. At length he hires a man to pretend that\r\nhe has come from the absent father, and has brought one thousand pieces\r\nof gold. The return of the father interferes with the plan; but\r\neverything is explained, the daughter is married, and the son forgiven.\r\n\r\nXX. The Truculentus, although the moral picture which it presents is\r\ndetestable, is remarkably clever, both for the variety of incidents and\r\nthe graphic delineations of character which it contains. The artful\r\ncourtesan who dupes and ruins her lovers; the three lovers\r\nthemselves—one a man of the town, another an unpolished but generous\r\nrustic, the third a stupid and conceited soldier; and, lastly, the\r\nslave, whose rude sagacity and bluff hatred of courtesans expose him to\r\nthe imputation of being actually savage (truculentus,) are powerfully\r\ndrawn; but notwithstanding its merits, it is not a play which can\r\npossibly please the tastes and sentiments of modern times.\r\n\r\nPlautus must not be dismissed without some notice of his prologues. The\r\nprologue of the Greek drama prepared the audience for the action of the\r\nplay, by narrating all the previous events of the story which were\r\nnecessary in order to understand the plot. That of the modern stage is\r\nan address of the poet to the spectators, praying for indulgence,\r\ndeprecating severe criticism, enlivened frequently by characteristic\r\nsketches and satirical observations on the manners and habits of the\r\nage. In these features it sometimes resembles the parabasis of the old\r\nAttic comedy. The prologues of Plautus united all these objects; and\r\nwhilst they introduced the comedy, their amusing gayety was calculated\r\nto put the audience in good humour and secure their applause. The shrewd\r\nknowledge which the author displayed in them of the character of his\r\nfellow-countrymen claimed their sympathies, and called forth their\r\nprejudices in his favour; whilst their polish and finish must have been\r\nappreciated by an assembly whose attention had not begun to flag or to\r\nweary. Some are long pieces. That of the Amphitruo, which is the\r\nlongest, extends to upwards of one hundred and fifty lines. That of the\r\nTrinummus takes the unusual form of a brief allegorical dialogue between\r\nLuxury and her daughter Poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\nSTATIUS COMPARED WITH MENANDER—CRITICISM OF CICERO—HYPOTHESES RESPECTING\r\nTHE EARLY LIFE OF TERENCE—ANECDOTE BELATED BY DONATUS—STYLE AND MORALITY\r\n  OF TERENCE—ANECDOTE OF HIM RELATED BY CORNELIUS NEPOS—HIS PECUNIARY\r\n    CIRCUMSTANCES AND DEATH—PLOTS AND CRITICISM OF HIS COMEDIES—THE\r\n                         REMAINING COMIC POETS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CÆCILIUS STATIUS.\r\n\r\nBetween Plautus and Terence flourished Cæcilius Statius, whom Volcatius,\r\nas well as Cicero,[191] places at the head of the list of Roman comic\r\npoets. He was an emancipated slave, and was born at Milan. The time of\r\nhis birth is unknown, but he died A. U. C. 586, and was therefore a\r\ncontemporary of Ennius. He did not depart from the established custom of\r\ntransferring the comedy of the Greek stage to that of Rome, and as far\r\nas a judgment can be formed from the titles of his forty-five comedies\r\nwhich are extant, they were all “_Palliatæ_.” The collection of\r\nfragments remaining of his works is a large one, but they are not\r\nsufficiently long or connected to test the favourable opinion\r\nentertained by the critics of ancient times.\r\n\r\nAulus Gellius[192] enables us to estimate the powers of C. Statius as a\r\ntranslator by a comparison of two passages taken from his “Plocius” with\r\nthe original of Menander. The result is, that the usual fault of\r\ntranslations is too plainly manifest, namely, the loss of the spirit and\r\nvigour. “Our comedies,” he remarks, “are written in an elegant and\r\ngraceful style, and may be read with pleasure; but if compared with the\r\nGreek originals, they fall so far short that the arms of Glaucus could\r\nnot have been more inferior to those of Diomede: the Greek is full of\r\nemotion, wit, and liveliness; the Latin dull and uninteresting.” Cicero,\r\nlikewise, and Varro have pronounced judgment upon his merits and\r\ndemerits. The sum and substance of their criticisms appear to be that\r\nhis excellencies consisted in the conduct of the plot,[193]\r\ndignity,[194] and in pathos,[195] whilst his fault was not sufficient\r\ncare in preserving the purity of the Latin style.\r\n\r\nCicero,[196] though not without hesitation, assigns the palm to him\r\namongst the writers of Latin comedy, as he awards that of epic poetry to\r\nEnnius, and that of tragedy to Pacuvius.[196] He says, on the other\r\nhand,[197] that the bad Latin of Cæcilius and Pacuvius formed exceptions\r\nto the usual style of their age, which was as commendable for its\r\nLatinity as for its innocence. And in a letter to Atticus,[198] he\r\nwrites:—“I said, not as Cæcilius, _Mane ut ex portu in Piræum_, but as\r\nTerence, whose plays, on account of their elegant Latinity, were thought\r\nto have been written by C. Lælius, Heri aliquot adolescentuli coimus in\r\nPiræum.” Horace,[199] without stating his own opinion, gives, as that\r\ncommonly received in his day, that Cæcilius is superior in dignity\r\n(_gravitate_,) Terence in skill (_arte_.)\r\n\r\nThe prologue of Terence’s comedy of the Hecyra proves that the earlier\r\nplays of Cæcilius had a great struggle to achieve success. The actor who\r\ndelivers it, an old favourite with the public, and probably the manager,\r\napologizes for bringing forward a play which had been once rejected\r\n(_exacta_,) on the ground that by perseverance in a similar course he\r\nhad caused the reception and approval of not one but many of the\r\ncomedies of Cæcilius which had been unsuccessful, and adds, that of\r\nthose which did succeed, some had a narrow escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           P. TERENTIUS AFER.\r\n\r\nP. Terentius Afer was a slave in the family of a Roman senator, P.\r\nTerentius Lucanus. His early history is involved in obscurity, but he is\r\ngenerally supposed to have been born A. U. C. 561.[200] His cognomen,\r\nAfer, points to an African origin, for it was a common custom to\r\ndistinguish slaves by an ethnical name. Whether there is any sufficient\r\nauthority for the tradition that he was a native of Carthage is\r\nuncertain. He could not, as was rightly observed by Fenestella,[201]\r\nhave been actually a prisoner of war, because he was both born and died\r\nin the interval between the first and second Punic Wars; nor, if he had\r\nbeen captured by the Numidians or Gætulians in any war which these\r\ntribes carried on with Carthage, could he have come into the possession\r\nof a Roman general by purchase, for there was no commercial intercourse\r\nbetween these nations and Rome until after the destruction of Carthage.\r\n\r\nAnother hypothesis has been suggested, which is by no means\r\nimprobable.[202] During the interval which elapsed between the first and\r\nsecond Punic Wars, the Carthaginians were involved in wars with their\r\nown mercenaries, the Numidians, and the southern Iberians. Some\r\nembassies from Rome also visited Carthage. Terence, therefore, may\r\npossibly have been taken prisoner in one of these wars, have been\r\npurchased by a Roman in the Carthaginian slave-market, and so have been\r\ncarried to Rome. What his condition was in the house of Lucanus is not\r\nknown; but it is clear that he had opportunities of cultivating his\r\nnatural talents, and acquiring that refined and masterly acquaintance\r\nwith all the niceties and elegancies of the Latin language which his\r\ncomedies exhibited, and it is probable, also, that very early in life he\r\nobtained his freedom.\r\n\r\nHis first essay as a dramatic author was the “Andrian,” perhaps the\r\nmost interesting, certainly the most affecting of all his comedies.\r\nTerence, an unknown and obscure young man, offered his play to the\r\nCurule Ædiles. They, accordingly, we are told, referred the new\r\ncandidate to the experienced judgment of Cæcilius Statius, then at the\r\nheight of his popularity. Terence, in humble garb, was introduced to\r\nthe poet whilst he was at supper, and seated on a low stool near the\r\ncouch on which Cæcilius was reclining, he commenced reading. He had\r\nfinished but a few lines when Cæcilius invited him to sit by him and\r\nsup with him. He rapidly ran through the rest of his play, and gained\r\nthe unqualified admiration of his hearer. This story is related by\r\nDonatus, but whether there is any truth in it is very doubtful. It is,\r\nat any rate, certain that “The Andrian” was not brought forward\r\nimmediately after obtaining this decision in its favour, for the date\r\nof its first representation[203] is two years subsequent to the death\r\nof Cæcilius.\r\n\r\nTalents of so popular a kind as those of Terence, and a genius\r\npresenting the rare combination of all the fine and delicate touches\r\nwhich characterize true Attic sentiment, without corrupting the native\r\ningenuous purity of the Latin language, could not long remain in\r\nobscurity. He was soon eagerly sought for as a guest and a companion by\r\nthose who could appreciate his powers. The great Roman nobility, such as\r\nthe Scipiones, the Lælii, the Scavolæ, and the Metelli, had a taste for\r\nliterature. Like the _Tyranni_ in Sicily and Greece, and like some of\r\nthe Italian princes in the middle ages, they assembled around them\r\ncircles of literary men, of whom the polite and hospitable host himself\r\nformed the nucleus and centre.\r\n\r\nThe purity and gracefulness of the style of Terence, “_per quam dulces\r\nLatini leporis facetiæ nituerunt_,”[204] show that the conversation of\r\nhis accomplished friends was not lost upon his correct ear and quick\r\nintuition. To these habits of good society may also be attributed the\r\nleading moral characteristics of his comedies. He invariably exhibits\r\nthe humanity and benevolence of a cultivated mind. He cannot bear\r\nloathsome and disgusting vice: he deters the young from the unlawful\r\nindulgence of their passions by painting such indulgence as inconsistent\r\nwith the refined habits and tastes of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nHis truthfulness compels him to depict habits and practices which were\r\nrecognised and allowed, as well by the manners of the Athenians, from\r\nwhom his comedies were taken, as by the lax morality of Roman\r\nfashionable society. Nor can we expect from a heathen writer of comedy\r\nso high a tone of morality as to lash vice with the severe censure which\r\nthe Christian feels it deserves, however venial society may pronounce it\r\nto be. It is as much as can be hoped for, if we find the principles of\r\ngood taste brought forward on the stage to influence public morals. Even\r\nthe code of Christian society too often contents itself with rebuking\r\nsuch vice as interferes with its own comfort or safety, and stigmatizes\r\nconduct, not for its immorality, but for its being unbecoming a\r\ngentleman. It is a standard which has its use, but it is not higher than\r\nthe Terentian.\r\n\r\nAnd if the plays of Terence are compared with those of authors\r\nprofessing to be Christians, which form part of the classical literature\r\nof the English nation, and were unblushingly witnessed on their\r\nrepresentation by some of both sexes, who, nevertheless, professed a\r\nregard for character, how immeasurably superior are the comedies of the\r\nheathen poet! Point out to the young the greater light and knowledge\r\nwhich the Christian enjoys, and the plays of Terence may be read without\r\nmoral danger. No amount of colouring and caution would be sufficient to\r\nshield the mind of an ingenuous youth from the imminent peril of being\r\ncorrupted by those of Wycherly and Congreve. Pictures of Roman manners\r\nmust represent them as corrupt, or they would not be truthful; but often\r\na good lesson is elicited from them. When the deceived wife\r\nreproachfully asks her offending husband with what face he can rebuke\r\nhis son because he has a mistress when he himself has two wives,[205]\r\none is far more struck with the honour which the strictness of Roman\r\nvirtue paid to the nuptial tie, than offended at the lenient view which\r\nis taken of the young man’s fault. The knaveries and tricks of\r\nDavus[206] meet with sufficient poetical justice in his fright and his\r\nflogging. The very dress in which the Meretrix, or woman of abandoned\r\nmorals, was costumed, kept constantly before the eyes of the Roman youth\r\ntheir grasping avarice, and therefore warned them of the ruin which\r\nawaited their victims; and the well-known passage,[207] in which the\r\nloathsome habits of this class are described, must have been, as Terence\r\nhimself says, a preservative of youthful virtue:—\r\n\r\n               Nosse omnia hæc saluti est adolescentulis.\r\n\r\nThe Pander, who basely, for the sake of filthy lucre, ministers to the\r\npassions of the young, is represented as the most degraded and\r\ncontemptible of mortals. The Parasite, who earns his meal by flattering\r\nand fawning on his rich patron, is made the butt of unsparing ridicule.\r\nAnd the timid, simple maiden, confiding too implicitly in the affections\r\nof her lover, and sacrificing her interests to that love, and not to\r\nlust or love of gain, is painted in such colours as to command the\r\nspectator’s pity and sympathy, and to call forth his approbation when\r\nshe is deservedly reinstated in her position as an honourable matron.\r\nLastly, her lover is not represented as a profligate, revelling in the\r\nindiscriminate indulgence of his passions, and rendering vice seductive\r\nby engaging manners and fascinating qualities: but we feel that his sin\r\nnecessarily results from the absence of a high tone of public morality\r\nto protect the young against temptation; and in all cases the reality\r\nand permanency of his affection for the victim of his wrongdoing is\r\nproved by his readiness and anxiety to become her husband.\r\n\r\nSo far as it can be so, comedy was in the hands of Terence an instrument\r\nof moral teaching, for it can only be so indirectly by painting men and\r\nmanners as they are, and not as they ought to be.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the patrons of Terence assisted him in the composition\r\nof his comedies, or, at least, corrected their language and style, and\r\nembellished them by the insertion of scenes and passages. An anecdote is\r\nrelated by Cornelius Nepos,[208] which, if true, at once proves the\r\npoint. He says that Lælius was at his villa near Puteoli during the\r\nfestival of the Matronalia. On this holiday the power of the Roman\r\nladies was absolute. Lælius was ordered by his wife to come to supper\r\nearly. He excused himself on the ground that he was occupied, and begged\r\nnot to be disturbed. When he appeared in the supper-room, he said he had\r\nnever been so well satisfied with his compositions. He was asked for a\r\nspecimen of what he had written, and immediately repeated a scene in the\r\n“Self-Tormentor”[209] of Terence. Terence, however, gently refutes this\r\nstory in the prologue to the “Adelphi,” and gives it a positive\r\ncontradiction in the prologue to the comedy in which the passage occurs.\r\nPerhaps he may at first have permitted the report to be credited for the\r\nsake of paying a compliment to his patron.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that he lived and died in poverty, and this tale is\r\nperpetuated in the following lines by Porcius Licinius:——\r\n\r\n                              Nil Publius\r\n     Scipio profuit, nihil ei Lælius, nil Furius,\r\n     Tres per idem tempus qui agitabant nobiles facillume,\r\n     Eorum ille opere ne domum quidem habuit conductitium\r\n     Saltem ut esset quo referret obitum domini servulus.\r\n\r\n     Nothing did Publius Scipio profit him;\r\n     Nothing did Lælius, nothing Furius;\r\n     At once the three great patrons of our bard.\r\n     And yet so niggard of their bounty to him,\r\n     He had not even wherewithal to hire\r\n     A house in Rome to which a faithful slave\r\n     Might bring the tidings of his master’s death.      _Colman._\r\n\r\nThe patrons of Terence, however, never deserved the reproach of\r\nmeanness. Nor could the comic poet have been very poor. He received\r\nlarge sums for his comedies; he had funds sufficient to reside for some\r\ntime in Greece; and at his death he possessed gardens on the Appian Way\r\ntwenty jugera in extent.\r\n\r\nA mystery hangs over his death, which took place B. C. 158.[210] It is\r\nnot known whether he died in Greece, or was lost at sea, together with\r\nall the comedies of Menander, which he had translated whilst in Greece,\r\nor whether, after embarking for Asia, he was, as Volcatius writes, never\r\nseen more:——\r\n\r\n               Ut Afer sex populo edidit comœdias\r\n             Iter hinc in Asiam fecit, navim cum semel\r\n             Conscendit visus nunquam est. Sic vitâ vacat.\r\n\r\nOne daughter married to a Roman knight survived him.\r\n\r\nSix comedies by Terence remain, and it is probable that these are all\r\nthat he ever wrote; they belong to the class technically denominated\r\n_Palliatæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            “_The Andrian._”\r\n\r\n“The Andrian” was exhibited at the Magalensian games, A. U. C. 588,[211]\r\nwhen the poet was in his twenty-seventh year. The musical accompaniment\r\nwas performed on equal flutes, right-handed and left-handed (_tibiis\r\nparibus dextris et sinistris_;) _i. e._, as the action was of a\r\nserio-comic character, the lively music of the _tibiæ dextræ_ was used\r\nin the comic scenes; the solemn sounds of the _tibiæ sinistræ_\r\naccompanied the serious portion. The manners are Greek, and the scene is\r\nlaid at Athens.\r\n\r\nThe plot is as follows:—Glycerium, a young Athenian girl, is placed\r\nunder the care of an Andrian, who educates her with his daughter\r\nChrysis. On his death Chrysis migrates to Athens, taking Glycerium with\r\nher as her sister, and is driven by distress to become a courtesan.\r\nPamphilus, the son of Simo, falls in love with Glycerium, and promises\r\nher marriage. Simo accidentally discovers his son’s attachment in the\r\nfollowing manner:—Chrysis dies, and at her funeral Glycerium imprudently\r\napproaches too near to the burning pile. Her lover rushes forward and\r\nembraces her, and affectionately expostulates with her for thus risking\r\nher life. “Dearest Glycerium!” he exclaims, “what are you doing? Why do\r\nyou rush to destruction?” Upon this the girl burst into a flood of\r\ntears, and threw herself into his arms. Simo had meanwhile betrothed\r\nPamphilus to Philumena, the daughter of Chremes; and although he had\r\ndiscovered his son’s passion, and Chremes had heard of the promise of\r\nmarriage, he pretends that the marriage with Philumena shall still take\r\nplace, in order that he may discover what his son’s real sentiments are.\r\nIn this difficulty, Pamphilus applies to Davus, a cunning and clever\r\nslave, who advises him to offer no opposition. At this crisis Glycerium\r\nis delivered of a child, which Davus causes to be laid at the door of\r\nSimo. Chremes sees the infant, and, understanding that Pamphilus is the\r\nfather, refuses to give him his daughter. The opportune arrival of\r\nCrito, an Andrian, discovers to Chremes that Glycerium is his own\r\ndaughter, whom on a former absence from Athens he had intrusted to his\r\nbrother Phania, now dead. Consequently Glycerium is married to\r\nPamphilus, and Philumena is given to a young lover, named Charinus, who\r\nhad hitherto pressed his suit in vain.\r\n\r\n“The Andrian” was, as it deserved to be, eminently successful, and\r\nencouraged the young author to persevere in the career which he had\r\nchosen. The interest is well sustained, the action is natural, and many\r\nscenes touching and pathetic, whilst the serious parts are skilfully\r\nrelieved by the adroitness of Davus, and his cleverness in getting out\r\nof the scrapes in which his cunning involves him. Cicero[212] praises\r\nthe funeral scene[213] as an example of that talent for narrative which\r\nTerence constantly displays. The substance of his criticism is, that the\r\npoet has attained conciseness without the sacrifice of beauty; and\r\nwhilst he has avoided wearisome affectation, has not omitted any details\r\nwhich are agreeable and interesting. Nothing can be more beautiful than\r\nthe struggle between the love and filial duty of Pamphilus,[214] which\r\nends with his determination to yield to his father’s will; nothing more\r\ncandid than his confession, or more upright than his earnest desire not\r\nto be suspected of suborning Crito.\r\n\r\n“The Andrian” has been closely imitated in the comedy of “The Conscious\r\nLovers,” by Sir Richard Steele; but in natural and graceful wit, as well\r\nas ingenuity, the English play is far inferior to the Roman original.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             “_Eunuchus._”\r\n\r\n“The Eunuch” is a transcript of a comedy by Menander. Even the\r\ncharacters are the same, except that Gnatho and Thraso together occupy\r\nthe place of Colax (the flatterer) in the original Greek. It was\r\nrepresented in the consulship of M. Valerius Messala and C. Fannius\r\nStrabo.[215] The musical accompaniment was Lydian. It was the most\r\npopular of all Terence’s plays, and brought the author the largest sum\r\nof money that had ever been paid for a comedy previously, namely, 8,000\r\nsestertii, a sum equivalent to about 65_l._ sterling. In vain Lavinius,\r\nTerence’s most bitter rival, endeavoured to interrupt the performance,\r\nand to accuse the author of plagiarism. His defence was perfectly\r\nsuccessful, and Suetonius states[216] that it was called for twice in\r\none day.\r\n\r\n“The Eunuch” is not equal to some of Terence’s plays in wit and humour;\r\nbut the plot is bustling and animated, and the dialogue gay and\r\nsparkling: it is also unquestionably the best acting play of the whole.\r\nThere is no play in which there is a greater individuality of character,\r\nor more effect of histrionic contrast. The lovesick and somewhat\r\neffeminate Phædria contrasts well with the ardent and passionate Chærea,\r\nthe swaggering, bullying Thraso with the pompous, philosophical\r\nparasite, who proposes to found a Gnathonic School. Parmeno is quite as\r\ncrafty, but far more clever, than Davus, and his description of the\r\nevils of love is the perfection of shrewd wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe plot is as follows:—Pamphila, the daughter of an Athenian citizen,\r\nwas kidnapped in her infancy, and sold to a Rhodian. He gave her to a\r\ncourtesan, who educated her with her own daughter Thais. Subsequently\r\nThais removes to Athens; and on the mother’s death Pamphila is sold to a\r\nsoldier, named Thraso. The soldier, being in love with Thais, resolves\r\nto make her a present of his purchase; but Thais has got another lover,\r\nPhædria, and Thraso refuses to give Pamphila to Thais unless Phædria is\r\nfirst turned off. She, thinking that she has discovered Pamphila’s\r\nrelations, and anxious to restore her to them, persuades Phædria to\r\nabsent himself for two days, in order that Thraso may present her with\r\nthe maiden. Meanwhile Chærea, Phædria’s younger brother, sees Pamphila\r\naccidentally, and falls desperately in love with her. He, therefore,\r\npersuades his brother’s slave, Parmeno, to introduce him into Thais’\r\nhouse in the disguise of a eunuch, whom Phædria has intrusted him to\r\nconvey to her during his absence. This leads to an _éclaircissement_.\r\nPamphila is discovered to be an Athenian citizen, and her brother\r\nChremes gives her in marriage to Chærea.\r\n\r\nThe most skilful part of this play is the method by which Terence has\r\nconnected the underplot between Parmeno and Pythias, the waiting-maid of\r\nThais, with the main action, their quarrels being entirely instrumental\r\nin bringing about the _dénouement_. Of all the comedies of Terence, the\r\nmoral tone of this is the lowest and most degrading. The connivance of\r\nLaches the father of Chærea, at his son’s illicit amour with Thais,\r\npresents a sad picture of moral corruption, as the arrangement coolly\r\nmade between Phædria and Gnatho[217] displays the meanness, which\r\nevidently was not considered inconsistent with the habits of Roman\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nGrievous as are these blemishes, this comedy must always be a favourite.\r\nThere are in it passages of which the lapse of ages has not diminished\r\nthe pungency: take, for example, the quiet satire contained in the\r\ncontrast which Chærea draws between the healthful and natural beauty of\r\nhis mistress and the “every-day forms of which his eyes are weary:”—\r\n\r\n CH.

It was acted the\r\nfirst time with Phrygian music, the second time with Lydian, in the\r\nconsulship of the celebrated Ti. Sempronius Gracchus and M. Juventius\r\nThalna.[219] This play may be considered as the masterpiece of Terence;\r\nit was a great favourite, notwithstanding its seriousness, and the\r\nabsence of comic drollery throughout. Steele[220] remarks with truth,\r\nthat it is a picture of human life; but there is not in the whole one\r\npassage which could raise a laugh. It is a good specimen of the refined\r\ntaste of Terence, who, unlike Plautus, abhorred vulgarity and ribaldry,\r\nand did not often condescend even to humour. Its favourable reception,\r\nmoreover, proves that, notwithstanding the preference which the Roman\r\npeople were inclined to give to gladiatorial shows, and the more\r\ninnocent amusements of buffoons and rope-dancers, and the noisy mirth\r\nwith which theatrical entertainments were frequently interrupted, they\r\ncould appreciate and enjoy a skilfully-constructed plot, and that\r\nquality which Terence especially claims for this comedy,[221] purity of\r\nstyle. The noble sentiment,\r\n\r\n               Homo sum, nihil humanum a me alienum puto,\r\n\r\nwas received by the whole audience with a burst of applause.\r\n\r\n_Plot._——Clinia, the son of Menedemus, falls in love with Antiphila,\r\nsupposed to be the daughter of a poor Corinthian woman, and, to avoid\r\nhis father’s anger, enters the service of the king of Persia. Menedemus,\r\nrepenting of his severity, punishes himself by purchasing a farm, and,\r\ngiving up all the luxuries of a town life, works hard from morning to\r\nnight. Like Laertes, in the Odyssey, he seeks by occupation to divert\r\nhis mind from the contemplation of his son’s absence:—\r\n\r\n     The mournful hour that tore his son away\r\n     Sent the sad sire in solitude to stray;\r\n     Yet, busied with his slaves, to ease his wo\r\n     He drest the vine, and bade the garden blow.\r\n                                                 _Odys._ xvi. 145.\r\n\r\nClinia returns from Asia, and takes up his abode at the house of his\r\nfriend Clitipho, the son of Chremes. This Clitipho has fallen in love\r\nwith Bacchis, an extravagant courtesan; and Syrus, an artful slave,\r\npersuades him to pass off Bacchis as the object of Clinia’s affection,\r\nand Antiphila as her waiting-maid. Chremes, next day, to whom Menedemus\r\nhad communicated his grief and remorse, acquaints him with the return of\r\nhis son, and recommends him to pretend ignorance of his amour. By the\r\nintrigues and knavery of Syrus, Chremes is induced to pay 10 minæ\r\n(40_l._) to Clitipho for the support of Bacchis. Sostrata, the wife of\r\nChremes, has mean while discovered, by a ring in her possession, that\r\nAntiphila is her daughter. She had, according to the cruel Athenian\r\npractice, given her to the Corinthian in infancy that she might not be\r\nexposed; she had given the ring, the means of her discovery, at the same\r\ntime. Clinia, therefore, marries Antiphila; and Chremes, although\r\nenraged at the imposition of Syrus, forgives him and his son, and\r\nClitipho promises that he will give up Bacchis and marry a neighbour’s\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nThis play abounds in amiable and generous sentiments and passages of\r\nsimple and graphic beauty. The whole scene, in which the habits of the\r\npoor girl whom Clinia loves is described, is exquisitely true to nature.\r\nHer occupation is like that of the chaste Lucretia in the legend:—\r\n\r\n     Texentem telam studiose ipsam offendimus,\r\n     Mediocriter vestitam veste lugubri,\r\n     Ejus anuis causa, opinor, quæ erat mortua;\r\n     Sine auro, tum ornatam, ita uti quæ ornantur sibi;\r\n     Nulla mala re esse expolitam muliebri;\r\n     Capillus passus, prolixus, circum caput\r\n     Rejectus negligenter.\r\n                                                 _Heaut._ II. iii.\r\n\r\n     Busily plying of the web we found her,\r\n     Decently clad in mourning, I suppose,\r\n     For the deceased old woman. She had on\r\n     No gold, or trinkets, but was plain and neat,\r\n     And dressed like those who dress but for themselves.\r\n     No female varnish to set off her beauty;\r\n     Her hair dishevelled, long, and flowing loose\r\n     About her shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe reader cannot but sympathize with the remark of Clitipho, when he\r\nhas heard this description of virtuous poverty,—“If all this is true, as\r\nI believe it is, you are the most fortunate of men.”\r\n\r\nThe degraded Bacchis also reads a valuable lesson to her sex, when she\r\nshows the blessings of the path of virtue from which she has strayed:—\r\n\r\n   Nam expedit bonas esse vobis: nos, quibuscum est res, non sinunt;\r\n   Quippe forma impulsi nostra, nos amatores colunt:\r\n   Hæc ubi immutata est, illi suum animum alio conferunt.\r\n   Nisi si prospectum interea aliquid est, desertæ vivimus.\r\n   Vobis cum uno semel ubi ætatem agere decretum ’st viro,\r\n   Cujus mos maxume ’st consimilis vostrum, hi se ad vos applicant.\r\n   Hoc beneficio utrique ab utrisque vero devincimini,\r\n   Ut nunquam ulla amori vestro incidere possit calamitas.\r\n                                                _Heaut._ II. iv.\r\n\r\n       Virtue’s your interest: those with whom we deal\r\n       Forbid it to be ours; for our gallants,\r\n       Charmed by our beauty, court us but for that;\r\n       Which, fading, they transfer their love to others.\r\n       If, then, mean while we look not to ourselves,\r\n       We live forlorn, deserted, and distressed.\r\n       You, when you’ve once agreed to pass your life\r\n       Bound to one man whose temper suits with yours,\r\n       He too attaches his whole heart to you.\r\n       Thus mutual friendship draws you each to each;\r\n       Nothing can part you, nothing shake your love.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful, too, is the unselfish devotion of Antiphila, when she\r\nartlessly professes to know nothing of other women’s feelings, but to\r\nknow this one thing only, that her happiness is wrapped up in that of\r\nher lover!——\r\n\r\n        Nescio alias; me quidem semper scio fecisse sedulo\r\n        Ut ex illius commodo meum compararem commodum.\r\n                                                    II. iv. 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PHORMIO.\r\n\r\nThe Phormio is a translation or adaptation of the Epidicazomene (_the\r\nsubject of the law suit_) of Apollodorus: it was entitled Phormio.\r\n\r\n              Quia primas partes qui aget, is erit Phormio\r\n              Parasitus, per quem res geretur maxume.[222]\r\n\r\nIt was acted four times; on the last occasion, in the consulship of C.\r\nFannius Strabo and M. Valerius Messala,[223] at the Roman or Circensian\r\ngames.\r\n\r\n_Plot._——Chremes, an Athenian, although he has a wife at Athens,\r\n(Nausistrata,) marries another at Lemnos under the feigned name of\r\nStilpho. By her he has a daughter, Phanium. When she has attained a\r\nmarriageable age, Chremes arranges with his brother Demipho, that she\r\nshall become the wife of his son Antipho. After this, the two old men\r\nleave Athens; and in their absence Demipho’s son, Phædria, falls in love\r\nwith a minstrel-girl, and the Lemnian wife arrives at Athens, together\r\nwith her daughter Phanium. There she dies; and Antipho, seeing Phanium\r\nat the funeral, becomes enamoured of her. Not knowing what to do, he\r\ntakes the advice of Phormio. In the case of a destitute orphan, the\r\nAthenian law compelled the nearest of kin to marry her or to give a\r\nportion. Phormio brings an action against Antipho; the case is proved,\r\nand he marries Phanium. The old men return, and Chremes, not knowing\r\nthat Phanium is his own daughter, is desperately angry. Mean while,\r\nDorio, the owner of Pamphila, threatens to sell her to some one else\r\nunless Phædria will immediately pay him thirty minæ. Geta, a knavish\r\nservant of Demipho, procures this money by telling the old gentleman\r\nthat Phormio is willing to take Antipho’s wife off his hands on\r\ncondition of receiving thirty minæ. Phanium is eventually discovered and\r\nacknowledged, and thus matters are happily concluded. Nausistrata is at\r\nfirst very angry, but relents on the submission of the repentant\r\nChremes.\r\n\r\nThis comedy supplied Molière with a large portion of the materials for\r\n“Les Fourberies de Scapin.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HECYRA.\r\n\r\nThis comedy, which, if the inscription may be trusted, is a translation\r\nor adaptation from one by Menander, was the least successful of all the\r\nplays of Terence. Twice it was rejected; on the first occasion, as the\r\nprologue to its second representation informs us, owing to “an\r\nunheard-of calamity and impediment.”[224] The thoughts of the public\r\nwere so occupied by a rope-dancer that they would not hear a word.\r\nTerence feared to risk a second representation on the same day; but such\r\nconfidence had he in the merits of the play, that he offered it a second\r\ntime for sale to the ædiles, and it was acted again in the consulship of\r\nCn. Octavius and T. Manlius.[225] It was acted a third time at the\r\nfuneral games of L. Æmilius Paulus, when it was again rejected. On its\r\nnext representation, it was successful; and Ambivius Turpio, by whose\r\ntheatrical company it was performed, and whose popularity had already\r\ncaused the revival of some unsuccessful plays,[226] undertook to plead\r\nits cause in a new prologue. This prologue enters fully into the\r\ncircumstances which caused its rejection. It states that some renowned\r\nboxers and expected performances of a rope-dancer caused a great tumult\r\nand disturbance, especially among the female part of the audience; that,\r\nat the next representation, the first act went off with applause, but a\r\nrumour spread of a gladiatorial combat, the people flocked to a show\r\nwhich was more congenial to their taste, and the theatre was deserted.\r\nIn conclusion, for the sake of the art of poetry, for the encouragement\r\nof himself to buy new plays, and for the protection of the poet from\r\nmalicious critics, Ambivio entreated the patient attention of the\r\naudience; and the appeal of the old favourite servant of the public was\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe Hecyra is, without doubt, inferior to the other plays of Terence,\r\nand probably for that reason has never been imitated in modern\r\nliterature. It is a drama of domestic life, and yet the plot is\r\ndeficient in interest, and the scenes want life and variety.\r\n\r\n_Plot._—Pamphilus, at the desire of his father, Laches, marries\r\nPhilumena, the daughter of Phidippus and Myrrhina, but being involved in\r\nan amour with Bacchis, has no affection for his wife, and avoids all\r\nintercourse with her. Meanwhile, Bacchis offended at his marriage, shows\r\nsuch an ill-temper, that his affection is weaned from her and\r\ntransferred to Philumena. Pamphilus then goes to Imbrus, and on his\r\nreturn is surprised with the news that Philumena has left his father’s\r\nhouse, and subsequently discovers that she has given birth to a son. He\r\nrefuses, consequently, to receive her as his wife; but as he loves her\r\nto distraction, he promises her mother that he will keep her shame\r\nsecret. As he will neither live with his wife nor assign any reason,\r\nBacchis is suspected of being the cause. But she clears herself from the\r\nsuspicion. Myrrhina, however, recognises upon her finger a ring\r\nbelonging to her daughter. This leads to the _dénouement_. Pamphilus had\r\none night when intoxicated met Philumena, and offered her violence. He\r\nhad forced a ring from her finger and given it to Bacchis. He,\r\ntherefore, with joy, acknowledges the child as his own, and restores his\r\ninjured wife to his affections.\r\n\r\nThe comedy derives its title, Hecyra (the mother-in-law,) from the part\r\ntaken by Sostrata, the mother of Pamphilus. Laches, unable to account\r\nfor the conduct of Philumena and his son, is firmly persuaded that his\r\nwife Sostrata had taken a prejudice against her daughter-in-law, and\r\nPamphilus, notwithstanding his dutiful affection for his mother, cannot\r\navoid being under a similar impression. Sostrata, in order to remove\r\nthis suspicion, offers with noble generosity to leave the house in order\r\nthat Philumena may return.\r\n\r\nThis amiable rivalry of maternal devotion on the one hand, and filial\r\nrespect on the other, constitutes the most interesting portion of the\r\ncomedy; and Terence has thus endeavoured to rescue the relation of\r\nmother-in-law from the prejudice which, too often deservedly, attached\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ADELPHI.\r\n\r\nThis comedy was acted at the funeral games of L. Æmilius Paulus\r\nMacedonius, the conqueror of Perseus, in the consulship of L. Anicius\r\nGallus and M. Cornelius Cethegus.[227] The music was Sarrane or Tyrian,\r\nthe grave character of which was suitable to the solemnity of the\r\noccasion. The cost of the representation was borne by Q. Fabius Maximus,\r\nand P. C. Scipio Africanus, the sons of the deceased.\r\n\r\n_Plot._—Demea, a country gentleman and a strict disciplinarian, has two\r\nsons, Æschinus and Ctesipho. Æschinus, the elder, is adopted by his\r\nuncle Micio, a bachelor of indulgent temper and somewhat loose\r\nprinciples, who lives a town life at Athens. Whilst Ctesipho is brought\r\nup strictly in the country, Æschinus is educated with too great\r\nindulgence, and pursues a course of riot and extravagance. One night, in\r\na moment of drunken passion, he offers violence to Pamphila, a young\r\nmaiden, well born but poor; for which outrage he makes amends by a\r\npromise of marriage. Ctesipho soon after falls in love with a minstrel\r\ngirl whom he accidentally meets; and Æschinus, to save his brother from\r\nhis father’s anger, conceals his amour and takes the discredit of it\r\nupon himself. At last he assaults the pander to whom the girl belongs,\r\ntakes her away by force, and gives her to his brother. The affair comes\r\nto Demea’s ears, who severely reproves Micio for ruining his son by\r\ninjudicious indulgence. Matters are at length explained, and the\r\nmarriage between Æschinus and Pamphila takes place, the minstrel girl is\r\nassigned to Ctesipho, and the price for her paid. The old bachelor,\r\nMicio, marries Sostrata, the mother of Pamphila, and, according to the\r\nusual rule of comedy, all the inferior persons of the drama are made\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nLax as the morals are which Micio refrains from correcting, his conduct\r\nillustrates a valuable principle in education; that——\r\n\r\n  There is a way of winning more by love\r\n  And urging of the modesty than fear.\r\n  Force works on servile humours, not the free.\r\n                                                        _Ben Jonson._\r\n\r\nNor are the evils likely to arise from indifference to moral principle\r\nleft entirely without an antidote. A wise and not indiscriminate\r\nindulgence is upheld by Demea; and, at the conclusion of the play, he\r\nannounces his deliberate change of character, but, at the same time,\r\npoints out the pernicious errors of that kindness and indulgence which\r\nproceeds from impulse and not from principle.\r\n\r\n                                   Dicam tibi:\r\n  Ut id ostenderem, quod te isti facilem et festivum putant,\r\n  Id non fieri ex vera vita, neque adeo ex æquo et bono;\r\n  Sed assentando atque indulgendo et largiendo, Micio.\r\n  Nunc adeo, si ob eam rem vobis mea vita invisa, Æschine, est,\r\n  Quia non justa, injusta, prorsus omnia omnino obsequor;\r\n  Missa facio; effundite, emite, facite, quod vobis lubet.\r\n  Sed si id voltis potius, quæ vos propter adulescentiam\r\n  Minus videtis, magis impense cupitis, consulitis parum,\r\n  Hæc reprehendere et corrigere quam, obsecundare in loco;\r\n  Ecce me qui id faciam vobis.\r\n\r\n  Now, therefore, if I’m odious to you, son,\r\n  Because I’m not subservient to your humour\r\n  In all things, right or wrong; away with care:\r\n  Spend, squander, and do what you will. But if,\r\n  In those affairs where youth has made you blind,\r\n  Eager, and thoughtless, you will suffer me\r\n  To counsel and correct you, and in due season\r\n  Indulge you, I am at your service.                        _Colman._\r\n\r\nThis twofold lesson is by no means a useless one to parents, not to\r\npurchase the affection of their children by injudicious indulgence like\r\nMicio, nor, on the other hand, like Demea, to strain the cord too tight,\r\nand thus tempt their children to pursue a course of deceit, and to\r\nrefuse their confidence to their natural advisers and guardians. The\r\nmost beautiful feature, however, of the play is the picture which it\r\ngives of fraternal affection. This was the last comedy of the author. It\r\nfurnished Molière with the idea of his “Ecole des Maris,” and Baron with\r\ngreat part of the plot of “L’Ecole de Pères.” Shadwell was also indebted\r\nto it for his “Squire of Alsatia,” and Garrick for his comedy of “The\r\nGuardian.”\r\n\r\nThe following comparison of the two great Roman comic poets by a French\r\ncritic is a just one:——\r\n\r\n“Ce poète (Térence) a beaucoup plus d’art, mais il me semble que l’autre\r\na plus d’esprit. Terence fait beaucoup plus parler qu’agir; l’autre fait\r\nplus agir que parler: et c’est le véritable caractère de la comédie, qui\r\nest beaucoup plus dans l’action que dans le discours. Cette vivacité me\r\nparoît donner encore un grand avantage à Plaute; c’est que ses intrigues\r\nsont bien variées, et ont toujours quelque chose qui surprend\r\nagréablement; au lieu que le théâtre semble languir quelquefois dans\r\nTérence, à qui la vivacité de l’action et les nœuds des incidens et des\r\nintrigues manquent manifestement.”\r\n\r\nIf Terence was inferior to Plautus in life and bustle and intrigue, and\r\nin the powerful delineation of national character, he is superior in\r\nelegance of language and refinement of taste; he far more rarely offends\r\nagainst decency, and he substitutes delicacy of sentiment for vulgarity.\r\nThe justness of his reflections more than compensates for the absence of\r\nhis predecessor’s humour: he touches the heart as well as gratifies the\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nIf he was deficient in _vis comica_, it is only the defect which Cæsar\r\nattributed to Roman comedy generally; and Cicero, who thought that Roman\r\nwit was even more piquant than Attic salt itself, paid him a merited\r\ncompliment in the following line:——\r\n\r\n            Quicquid come loquens atque omnia dulcia dicens.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to Terence that he superabounds in\r\nsoliloquies;[228] but it is not surprising that he should have delighted\r\nin them, since no author ever surpassed him in narrative. His natural\r\nand unaffected simplicity renders him the best possible teller of a\r\nstory: he never indulges in a display of forced wit or in attempts at\r\nepigrammatic sharpness; there are no superfluous touches, although his\r\npictures are enlivened by sufficient minuteness; his moral lessons are\r\nconveyed in familiar proverb-like suggestions, not in dull and pedantic\r\ndogmatism.\r\n\r\nThe remaining comic poets will require but brief notice. L. Afranius was\r\na contemporary of Terence, and flourished about B. C. 150. His comedies\r\nwere all of the lowest class of _fabulæ togatæ_ (tabernariæ;) and he was\r\ngenerally allowed by the critics to possess great skill in accommodating\r\nthe Greek comedy to the representation of Roman manners:——\r\n\r\n     Dicitur Afrani _toga_ convenisse Menandro.\r\n                                             _Hor. Ep._ II. i. 57.\r\n\r\nHis style was short and eloquent (_perargutus et disertus_,)[229] but he\r\nwas a man of low tastes and profligate morals;[230] and, therefore,\r\nalthough, from living amidst the scenes of vulgar vice which he\r\ndelighted to paint, his characters were true to nature, they were\r\nrevolting and disgusting. His immorality, probably, as much as his\r\ntalent, caused him to continue a favourite under the most corrupt times\r\nof the empire. Fragments and titles of many of his comedies have been\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nThe name of Atilius is made known to us by Cicero, who mentions him\r\nthree times. In a letter to Atticus,[231] he calls him a most crabbed\r\npoet (_poeta durissimus_,) and quotes the following line from one of his\r\ncomedies:—\r\n\r\n     Suam cuique sponsam, mihi meam; suum cuique amorem, mihi meum.\r\n\r\nIn the treatise “_De Finibus_,”[232] he speaks of him as the author of a\r\nbad translation of the Electra of Sophocles, and refers to the testimony\r\nof Licinius, who pronounces him as “hard as iron”——\r\n\r\n           Ferreum scriptorem; verum opinor; scriptorem tamen\r\n           Ut legendus sit;\r\n\r\nand, lastly, in the “Tusculan Disputations,”[233] he gives the title of\r\none of his plays—Μισογυνος (the Woman-hater.) Of his birth and private\r\nhistory nothing has been recorded.\r\n\r\nP. Licinius Tegula is generally supposed to have been one of the oldest\r\nof the Latin comic writers, having flourished as early as the beginning\r\nof the second century B. C. The few fragments which remain of his works\r\nafford no opportunity of determining how far he deserved the place\r\nassigned to him in the epigram of Volcatius.\r\n\r\nLavinius Luscius is severely criticised by Terence in his prologues to\r\nthe Eunuchus, Heautontimorumenos, and Phormio, although he is not\r\nmentioned by name. Terence, however, defends the severity of his\r\nstrictures, on the ground that Luscius was the first aggressor. In the\r\nfirst of the above-mentioned prologues, we are informed that he\r\ntranslated well; but, by unskilful alterations and adaptations of the\r\nplots, made bad Latin comedies out of good Greek ones:—\r\n\r\n                     —— bene vertendo et describendo male\r\n              Ex Græcis bonis Latinas fecit non bonas.\r\n\r\nTwo plays of Menander are mentioned as having been thus ill-treated—the\r\nPhasma (Phantom,) and the Thesaurus (Treasure.) How he spoilt the plot\r\nof the former is not stated; but in the version of the Thesaurus,\r\nTerence convicts Luscius of a legal blunder. A young prodigal has sold\r\nhis inheritance, on which his father’s tomb stands, to an old miser. The\r\nfather, foreseeing the consequence of his son’s extravagance, had,\r\nbefore his death, bid him open the tomb after the expiration of ten\r\nyears. He does so, and finds a treasure. The old man claims the treasure\r\nas his own, and the young man brings an action to recover it. The\r\nmistake of which Luscius was guilty, was, that in the conduct of the\r\ncause he made the defendant open the pleadings instead of the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nOf the works of Q. Trabea no fragments remain except the short passages\r\nquoted by Cicero,[234] and the time at which he flourished is unknown.\r\nThere is an anecdote which relates that Muretus presented to Jos.\r\nScaliger a translation in Latin verse from a poem of Philemon, preserved\r\nby Stobæus, which he pretended was by Trabea. Scaliger was imposed upon;\r\nand in his notes on Varro, quoted the verses of Muretus as the work of\r\nTrabea. When he discovered the trick, he suppressed them in the Latin\r\neditions of his notes, and revenged himself on Muretus by a libellous\r\nepigram.[235]\r\n\r\nThe last of these dramatic writers who remains to be mentioned is Sextus\r\nTurpilius. A few fragments, as well as the titles of some of his plays,\r\nare still extant. All the titles are Greek, and, therefore, probably his\r\ncomedies were _Fabulæ Palliatæ_. He flourished during the second century\r\nB. C., and died, according to the Eusebian Chronicle, at the\r\ncommencement of the first century.[236]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n WHY TRAGEDY DID NOT FLOURISH AT ROME—NATIONAL LEGENDS NOT INFLUENTIAL\r\n WITH THE PEOPLE—FABULÆ PRÆTEXTATÆ—ROMAN RELIGION NOT IDEAL—ROMAN LOVE\r\nFOR SCENES OF REAL ACTION AND GORGEOUS SPECTACLE—TRAGEDY NOT PATRONISED\r\n           BY THE PEOPLE—PACUVIUS—HIS DULORESTES AND PAULUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what has been already said, it is sufficiently clear that the\r\nItalians, like all other Indo-European races, had some taste for the\r\ndrama, but that this taste developed itself in a love for scenes of\r\nhumorous satire. Whilst, therefore, Roman comedy originated in Italy,\r\nand was brought to perfection by the influence of Greek literature,\r\nRoman tragedy,[237] on the other hand, was transplanted from Athens, and\r\nwith the exception of a very few cases, was never anything more than\r\ntranslation or imitation.\r\n\r\nIn the century, during which, together with comedy, it flourished and\r\ndecayed, it boasted of five distinguished writers—Livius, Nævius,\r\nEnnius, Pacuvius, and Attius. The only claim of Atilius to be considered\r\nas a tragic poet is his having been the translator of one Greek tragedy.\r\nBut, in after ages, Rome did not produce one tragic poet unless Varius\r\ncan be considered an exception. His tragedy, _Thyestes_, which enjoyed\r\nso high a reputation amongst the critics of the Augustan age, that\r\nQuintilian, whose judgment generally agrees with them, pronounces it as\r\nable to bear comparison with the productions of the Greek tragic poets.\r\nIt was acted on one occasion, namely, after the return of Octavius from\r\nthe battle of Actium, and the poet received for it 1,000,000 sesterces\r\n(about 8,000_l._)[238] The tragedies attributed to Seneca were never\r\nacted, and were only composed for reading and recitation.\r\n\r\nSome account has already been given of Livius, Nævius, and Ennius,\r\nbecause their poetical reputation rests rather on other grounds than on\r\ntheir talents for dramatic poetry. But, before proceeding with the lives\r\nand writings of Pacuvius and Attius, it will be necessary to examine the\r\ncauses which prevented tragedy from flourishing at Rome.\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to account for this phenomenon, it is not sufficient to\r\nsay, that in the national legends of the Hellenic race were imbodied\r\nsubjects essentially of a dramatic character, and that epic poetry\r\ncontained incidents, characters, sentiments, and even dramatic\r\nmachinery, which only required to be put upon the stage. Doubtless the\r\nGreek epics and legends were an inexhaustible source of inspiration to\r\nthe tragic poets. But it is also true that the Romans had national\r\nlegends which formed the groundwork of their history, and were\r\ninterwoven in their early literature. These legends, however, were\r\nprivate, not public property; they were preserved in the records and\r\npedigrees of private families, and ministered to their glory, and were\r\ntherefore more interesting to the members of these houses than to the\r\npeople at large: they were not preserved as a national treasure by\r\npriestly families, like those of the Attic Eumolpidæ, nor did they twine\r\nthemselves around the hearts of the Roman people, as the venerable\r\ntraditions of Greece did around those of that nation. The Romans did not\r\nlive in them—they were embalmed in their poets as curious records of\r\nantiquity or acknowledged fictions—they did not furnish occasions for\r\nawakening national enthusiasm. Although, therefore, they existed, they\r\nwere comparatively powerless over the popular mind as elements of\r\ndramatic effect.\r\n\r\nThey were jealously preserved by illustrious houses, furnished materials\r\nin a dry and unadorned form to the annalists, and were embellished by\r\nthe graphic power of the historian; but it is not probable that they\r\never constituted, in the same sense as the Greek legends, the folklore\r\nof the Roman people. In themselves, the lays of Horatius and of the lake\r\nRegillus were sufficiently stirring, and those of Lucretia, Coriolanus,\r\nand Virginia sufficiently moving, for tragedy, but they were not\r\nfamiliar to the masses of the people.\r\n\r\nA period at length arrived in which there was a still further reason why\r\nRoman national legends, however adapted for tragedy they might be\r\nabstractedly, had not power to move the affections of the Roman\r\npopulace. It ceased to have a personal interest in them. The masses had\r\nundergone a complete change. The Roman people of the most flourishing\r\nliterary eras were not the descendants of those who maintained the\r\nnational glory in the legendary period. Not only were almost all the\r\npatrician families then extinct, but war and poverty had extinguished\r\nthe middle classes, and miserably thinned the lower orders. The old\r\nveterans of pure Roman blood who survived were settled at a distance\r\nfrom Rome in the different military colonies. Into the vacancy thus\r\ncaused had poured thousands of slaves, captives in the bloody wars of\r\nGaul and Spain, and Greece and Africa. These and their descendants\r\nreplaced the ancient people. Many of them received liberty and\r\nfranchise, and some by their talents and energy arrived at wealth and\r\nstation. But they could not possibly be Romans at heart, or consider the\r\npast glories of their adopted country as their own. They were bound by\r\nno ties of old associations to it. The ancient legends had no especial\r\ninterest in their eyes. It mattered little whether the incidents and\r\ncharacters of the tragedy which they witnessed were Greek or Roman. It\r\nwas to the rise of this new element of population, and the displacement\r\nor absorption of the old race, that the decline of patriotism was\r\nowing—the careless disregard of everything except daily sustenance and\r\ndaily amusement,[239] which paved the way for the empire, and marked the\r\ndownfall of liberty. From this cause, also, resulted in some degree the\r\nnon-influential position which national traditions occupied at Rome; and\r\ntragedy, though for a time popular, could not maintain its popularity.\r\nThus it entirely disappeared; and, when it revived, it came forth, not\r\nas the favourite of the people, but under the patronage of select\r\ncircles, and took its place, not like Athenian tragedy, as the leading\r\nliterature of the age, but simply as one species of literary\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nA people made up of these elements held out no temptation to the poet to\r\nleave the beaten track of his predecessor, the imitations of Greek\r\ntragedy. They were step-sons of Rome, as Scipio Æmilianus called the\r\nmob, who clamoured at his saying that the death of Tiberius Gracchus was\r\njust:—\r\n\r\n                         Mercedibus emptæ\r\n     Et viles operæ quibus est mea Roma noverca.\r\n                                                 _Petron._ v. 164.\r\n\r\nThe poet’s real patrons had been educated on Greek principles; and hence\r\nGreek taste was completely triumphant over national legend, and the\r\nheroes of Roman tragedy were those who were celebrated in Hellenic\r\nstory. The Roman historical plays, (prætextatæ,) which approached most\r\nnearly towards realizing the idea of a national tragedy, were graceful\r\ncompliments to distinguished individuals. They were usually performed at\r\npublic funerals; and as, in the procession, masks representing the\r\nfeatures of the deceased were borne by persons of similar stature, so\r\nincidents in his life formed the subject of the drama which was\r\nexhibited on the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe list of _Fabulæ Prætextatæ_, even if it were perfect, would occupy\r\nbut narrow limits; nor had they sufficient merits to stand the test of\r\ntime. They survive but in name, and the titles extant are but nine in\r\nnumber:——\r\n\r\nThe Paulus of Pacuvius, which represented an incident in the life of L.\r\nÆmilius Paulus.[240]\r\n\r\nThe Brutus, Æneadæ, and Marcellus of Attius.[241]\r\n\r\nIter ad Lentulum, a passage in the life of Balbus.[242]\r\n\r\nCato.\r\n\r\nDomitius Nero, by Maternus, in the time of Vespasian.\r\n\r\nVescio, by the Satirist (?) Persius.\r\n\r\nOctavian, by Seneca, in the reign of Trajan.\r\n\r\nNor must it be forgotten, in comparing the influence which tragedy\r\nexercised upon the people of Athens and Rome, that with the former it\r\nwas a part and parcel of the national religion. By it not only were the\r\npeople taught to sympathize with their heroic ancestors, but their\r\nsympathies were hallowed. In Greece, the poet was held to be\r\ninspired—poetry was the voice of deified nature—the tongue in which the\r\nnatural held communion with the supernatural, the visible with the\r\ninvisible. With the Romans, poetry was nothing more than an amusement of\r\nthe fancy; with the Greeks, it was a divinely originating emotion of the\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nHence, in Athens, the drama was, as it were, an act of worship,—it\r\nformed an integral part of a joyous, yet serious, religious festival.\r\nThe theatre was a temple; the altar of a deity was its central point;\r\nand a band of choristers moved in solemn march and song in honour of the\r\ngod, and, in the didactic spirit which sanctified their office, taught\r\nmen lessons of virtue. Not that the audience entered the precincts with\r\ntheir hearts imbued with holy feelings, or with the thoughts of\r\nworshippers; but this is always the case when religious ceremonials\r\nbecome sensuous. The real object of the worship is by the majority\r\nforgotten. But still the Greeks were habituated unconsciously to be\r\naffected by the drama, as by a development of religious sentiments. With\r\nthe Romans, the theatre was merely a place of secular amusement. The\r\nthymele existed no longer as a memorial of the sacrifice to the god. The\r\norchestra, formerly consecrated to the chorus, was to them nothing more\r\nthan stalls occupied by the dignitaries of the state. Dramas were\r\ncertainly exhibited at the great Megalensian games, but they were only\r\naccessories to the religious character of the festival. A holy season\r\nimplies rest and relaxation—a _holiday_ in the popular sense of the\r\nword—and theatrical representations were considered a fit and proper\r\nspecies of pastime; but as religion itself did not exercise the same\r\ninfluence over the popular mind of the Romans which it did over that of\r\nthe Greeks, so neither with the Romans did the drama stand in the place\r\nof the handmaid of religion.\r\n\r\nAgain, their religion, though purer and chaster, was not ideal like that\r\nof the Greeks. Its freedom from human passions removed it out of the\r\nsphere of poetry, and, therefore, it was neither calculated to move\r\nterror nor pity. The moral attributes of the Deity were displayed in\r\nstern severity; but neither the belief nor the ceremonial sought to\r\ninflame the heart of the worshipper with enthusiasm. Rome had no\r\npriestly caste uniting in one and the same person the character of the\r\nbard and of the minister of religion. In after ages, she learned from\r\nthe Greeks to call the poet sacred, but the holiness which she\r\nattributed to his character was not the earnest belief of the heart. The\r\nRoman priests were civil magistrates; religion, therefore, became a part\r\nof the civil administration, and a political engine. It mattered little\r\nwhat was believed as true. The old national faith of Italy, not being\r\nfirmly rooted in the heart, soon became obsolete: it readily admitted\r\nthe engrafting of foreign superstitions. The old deities assumed the\r\nnames of the Greek mythology: they exchanged their attributes and\r\nhistories for those of Greek legend, and a host of strange gods filled\r\ntheir Pantheon. They had, however, no hold either on the belief or the\r\nlove of the people: they were mythological and unreal characters, fit\r\nonly to furnish subjects and embellishments for poetry.\r\n\r\nNor was the genius of the Roman people such as to sympathize with the\r\nlegends of the past. The Romans lived in the present and the future,\r\nrather than in the past. The poet might call the age in which he lived\r\ndegenerate, and look forward with mournful anticipations to a still\r\nlower degradation, whilst he looked back admiringly to bygone times.\r\nThrough the vista of past years, Roman virtue and greatness seemed to\r\nhis imagination magnified: he could lament, as Horace did, a gradual\r\ndecay, which had not as yet reached its worst point:——\r\n\r\n     Ætas parentum pejor avis tulit\r\n       Nos nequiores mox daturos\r\n         Progeniem vitiosiorem.\r\n                                                _Od._ III. vi. 46.\r\n\r\nBut the people did not sympathize with these feelings: they delighted in\r\naction, not in contemplation and reflection. They did not look back upon\r\ntheir national heroes as demigods, or dream over their glories: they\r\nwere pressing forward and extending the frontiers of their empire,\r\nbringing under their yoke tribes and nations which their forefathers had\r\nnot known. If they regarded their ancestors at all, it was not in the\r\nlight of men of heroic stature, as compared with themselves, but as\r\nthose whom they could equal or even surpass: they lived in hope and not\r\nin memory.\r\n\r\nThese are not the elements of character which would lead a people to\r\nrealize to themselves the ideal of tragedy. The tragic poet at Athens\r\nwould have been sure that the same subject which inspired him would also\r\ninterest his audience—that if his genius rose to the height which their\r\ncritical taste demanded, he could reckon up the sympathy of a theatre\r\ncrowded with ten thousand of his countrymen. A Roman tragic poet would\r\nhave been deserted for any spectacle of a more stirring nature—his most\r\naffecting scenes and noble sentiments, for scenes of real action and\r\nreal life. The bloody combats of the gladiators, the miserable captives\r\nand malefactors stretched on crosses, expiring in excruciating agonies,\r\nor mangled by wild beasts, were real tragedies—the sham fights and\r\nNaumachiæ, though only imitations, were real dramas, in which those\r\npursuits which most deeply interested the spectators, which constituted\r\ntheir chief duties and highest glories, were visibly represented. Even\r\ngorgeous spectacles fed their personal vanity and pride in their\r\nnational greatness. The spoil of conquered nations, borne in procession\r\nacross the stage, reminded them of their triumphs and their victories;\r\nand the magnificent dress of the actors—the model of the captured city,\r\npreceded and followed by its sculptures in marble and ivory—represented\r\nin mimic grandeur the ovation or the triumph of some successful general,\r\nwhose return from a distant expedition, laden with wealth, realized the\r\nrumours which had already arrived at the gates of Rome; whilst the\r\nscene, glittering with glass, and gold, and silver, and adorned with\r\nvariegated pillars of foreign marble, told ostentatiously of their\r\nwealth and splendour.[243]\r\n\r\nAgain, the Romans were a rough, turbulent people, full of physical\r\nrather than intellectual energy, loving antagonism, courting peril,\r\nsetting no value on human life or suffering. Their very virtues were\r\nstern and severe. The unrelenting justice of a Brutus, representing as\r\nit did the victory of principle over feeling, was to them the height of\r\nvirtue. They were ready to undergo the extreme of physical torture with\r\nRegulus, and to devote themselves to death, like Curtius and the Decii.\r\nHard and pitiless to themselves, they were, as might be expected, the\r\nsame towards others. They were, in fact, strangers to both the passions,\r\nwhich it was the object of tragedy to excite and to purify, Pity and\r\nTerror.[244] They were too stern to pity, too unimaginative to be moved\r\nby the tales of wonder and deeds of horror which affected the tender and\r\nmarvel-loving imagination of the Greeks. Being an active, and not a\r\nsentimental people, they did not appreciate moral suffering and the\r\nstruggles of a sensitive spirit. They were moved only by scenes of\r\nphysical suffering and agony.\r\n\r\nThe public games of Greece at Olympia, or the Isthmus, were bloodless\r\nand peaceful, and the refinements of poetry mingled with those which\r\nwere calculated to invigorate the physical powers and develop manly\r\nbeauty. Those of Rome were exhibitions, not of moral, but of physical\r\ncourage and endurance: they were sanguinary and brutalizing,—the\r\namusements of a nation to whom war was not a necessary evil or a\r\nstruggle for national existence, for hearths and altars, but a pleasure\r\nand a pastime—the means of gratifying an aggressive ambition. The tragic\r\nfeeling of Greece is represented by the sculptured grief of Niobe, that\r\nof Rome by the death-struggles which distort the features and muscles of\r\nthe Laocoon. It was, if the expression is allowable, _amphitheatrical_,\r\nnot _theatrical_.\r\n\r\nTo such a people the moral woes of tragedy were powerless; and yet it is\r\nto the people that the drama, if it is to flourish, must look for\r\npatronage. A refined and educated society, such as always existed at\r\nRome during its literary period, might applaud a happy adaptation from\r\nthe Greek tragedians, and encourage a poet in his task—for it is only an\r\neducated and refined taste which can appreciate such talent as skilful\r\nimitation displays; but a tragic drama under such circumstances could\r\nhardly hope to be national. Nor must it be forgotten, with reference to\r\ntheir taste for spectacle, that the artistic accessories of the drama\r\nwould have a better chance of success with a people like the Romans than\r\nliterary merit, because the pleasures of art are of a lower and more\r\nsensuous kind. Hence, in the popular eye, the decoration of the theatre\r\nand the costume of the performers naturally became the principal\r\nrequisites, whilst the poet’s office was considered subordinate to the\r\nmanner in which the play was put upon the stage; and thus the degenerate\r\ntheatrical taste which prevailed in the days of Horace called forth the\r\npoet’s well-known and well-deserved criticism.[245]\r\n\r\nIt cannot, indeed, be asserted that tragedy was never, to a certain\r\nextent, an acceptable entertainment at Rome, but only that it never\r\nflourished at Rome as it did at Athens—that no Roman tragedies can,\r\nnotwithstanding all that has been said in their praise and their\r\ndefence, be compared with those of Greece, and that the tragic drama\r\nnever maintained such a hold on the popular mind as not to be liable to\r\nbe displaced by amusements of a more material and less intellectual\r\nkind. It was imitative and destitute of originality. It was introduced\r\nfrom without as one portion of the new literature; it did not grow\r\nspontaneously by a process of natural development out of preceding eras\r\nof epic and lyric poetry, and start into being, as it did at Athens, at\r\nthe very moment when the public mind and taste was ready to receive and\r\nappreciate it.\r\n\r\nThree eras, separated from one another by chasms, the second wider than\r\nthe first, produced tragic poets. In the first of these flourished\r\nLivius Andronicus, Nævius, and Ennius; in the second Pacuvius and\r\nAttius; in the third Asinius Pollio[246] wrote tragedies, the plots of\r\nwhich, as the words of Virgil seem to imply, were taken from Roman\r\nhistory.[247] Varius either wrote, or, as some of the Scholiasts assert,\r\nstole, the “Thyestes” from Cassius or Virgil. Ovid attempted a “Medea,”\r\nof which Quintilian speaks, as being, to say the least, a promising\r\nperformance; and even the Emperor Augustus himself, together with other\r\nmen of genius, tried their hands, though unsuccessfully, at tragedy. The\r\nepistle of Horace to the Pisos shows at once the prevalence of this\r\ntaste, and that general ignorance of the rules and principles of art\r\nrequired instruction. Ten rhetorical dramas, attributed with good reason\r\nto the philosopher Seneca, complete the catalogue of tragedies belonging\r\nto this era, but with the exception of these, no specimens remain; most\r\nprobably they did not merit preservation. The tragedies of the older\r\nschool were of a higher stamp, and they kept their place in the public\r\nestimation long enough to give birth to the newer and inferior school.\r\nPassages from the old Latin tragedies quoted by Cicero well deserve the\r\nadmiration with which he regarded them; and a fragment of the\r\n“Prometheus” of Attius is marked by a grandeur and sublimity which makes\r\nus regret the almost total loss of this branch of Roman literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PACUVIUS (BORN B. C. 220.)\r\n\r\nThe era at which Roman tragedy reached its highest degree of perfection\r\nwas the second of those mentioned, and was simultaneous with that of\r\ncomedy. Both nourished together; for, whilst Terence was so successfully\r\nreproducing the wit and manners of the new Attic comedy, M. Pacuvius was\r\nenriching the Roman drama with free imitations of the Greek tragedians.\r\nHe was a native of Brundisium, and nephew,[248] or, according to St.\r\nJerome, grandson of the poet Ennius. Although born as early as B. C.\r\n220, he does not appear to have attained the height of his popularity\r\nuntil B. C.[249] During his residence at Rome, where he remained until\r\nafter his 80th year,[250] he distinguished himself as a painter as well\r\nas a dramatic poet; and one of his pictures in the temple of Hercules\r\nwas thought only to be surpassed by the work of Fabius Pictor.[251] He\r\nformed one of that literary circle of which Lælius was so great an\r\nornament. The close of his long life was passed in the retirement of\r\nTarentum, where he died in the ninetieth year of his age. A simple and\r\nunpretending epigram is preserved by Aulus Gellius,[252] which may\r\nprobably have been written by himself:——\r\n\r\n          Adulescens, etsi properas, te hoc saxum rogat\r\n          Uti ad se aspicias, deinde quod scriptum est, legas.\r\n          Hic sunt poetæ Pacuvi Marci sita\r\n          Ossa. Hoc volebam, nescius ne esses. Vale!\r\n\r\nPacuvius was a great favourite with those who could make allowances for\r\nthe faults, and appreciate the merits, of the great writers of\r\nantiquity, and his verses were popular in the time of J. Cæsar;[253] and\r\nthat lover of the old Roman literature, Cicero, though not blind to his\r\nfaults, is warm in his commendations. He was not without admirers in the\r\nAugustan age, and even his defects had zealous defenders in the time of\r\nPersius amongst those who could scarcely discover a fault in any work\r\nwhich savoured of antiquity.[254] The archaic ruggedness of his\r\nlanguage, his uncouth forms, such as _axim_, _tetinerim_,\r\n_egregiissimus_, and his unauthorized constructions, like _mihi piget_,\r\nwere due to the unsettled state of the Latin language in his days. His\r\nstrange combinations, such as _repandirostrum_ and _incurvicervicum_,\r\nmay possibly have been suggested by the study of Greek, and by his\r\noverweening admiration for its facility of composition. But his polish,\r\npathos, and learning,[255] the harmony of his periods,[256] his\r\neloquence,[257] his fluency, his word-painting,[258] are peculiarly his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe tragedies of Pacuvius were not mere translations, but adaptations of\r\nGreek tragedies to the Roman stage. The fragments which are extant are\r\nfull of new and original thoughts. His plots were borrowed from the\r\nGreek, but the plan and treatment were his own. The lyric portion\r\nappears to have occupied an important place in his tragedies, and\r\ndisplays considerable imaginative power. It is evident that his mind\r\nonly required suggestions, and was sufficiently original, to form new\r\ncombinations. The titles of thirteen of his tragedies are\r\npreserved,[259] of which the most celebrated were the “Antiopa” and\r\n“Dulorestes” (Orestes in Slavery.) Of the former, the only fragment\r\nextant is one severely criticised by Persius. The latter was principally\r\nfounded on the “Iphigenia in Tauris” of Euripides,[260] although the\r\nauthor was evidently inspired with the poetical conceptions of Æschylus.\r\nIn fact, Pacuvius is less Euripidean than the other Roman tragic poets.\r\nThe very roughness of his style and audacity of his expressions have\r\nsomewhat of the solemn grandeur and picturesque boldness which\r\ndistinguish the father of Attic tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the “Dulorestes” was the adventures of the son of\r\nAgamemnon. When driven from the palace of his ancestors, he was in exile\r\nand in slavery.[261] On the first representation of this play, the\r\ngenerous friendship of Orestes and Pylades called forth the most\r\nenthusiastic applause from the audience, who then probably heard the\r\nlegend for the first time. “What acclamations,” says Lælius,[262]\r\n“resounded through the theatre at the representation of the new play of\r\nmy guest and friend, M. Pacuvius, when the king, being ignorant which of\r\nthe two was Orestes, Pylades affirmed that he was Orestes, that he might\r\nbe put to death in his place, whilst Orestes persevered in asserting\r\nthat he was the man!”\r\n\r\nOne of his plays, “Paulus,” was a _fabula prætextata_: its subject was\r\ntaken entirely from Roman history, the hero being L. Æm. Paulus, the\r\nconqueror of Perseus. Besides tragedies, the grammarians have attributed\r\nto him one satura.[263] He is said also to have written comedies; but\r\nthere is no evidence in favour of any, with the exception of one,\r\nentitled “Mercator.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n L. ATTIUS—HIS TRAGEDIES AND FRAGMENTS—OTHER WORKS—TRAGEDY DISAPPEARED\r\n  WITH HIM—ROMAN THEATRES—TRACES OF THE SATIRIC SPIRIT IN GREECE—ROMAN\r\n  SATIRE—LUCILIUS—CRITICISMS OF HORACE, CICERO, AND QUINTILIAN—PASSAGE\r\n               QUOTED BY LACTANTIUS—LÆVIUS, A LYRIC POET.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   L. ATTIUS (BORN ABOUT B. C. 170.)\r\n\r\nAlthough born about fifty years later than Pacuvius,[264] Attius was\r\nalmost his contemporary, and a competitor for popular applause. The\r\namiable old poet lived on the most friendly terms with his young rival;\r\nand A. Gellius tells us that after he withdrew from the literary society\r\nof Rome to retirement at Tarentum, he on one occasion invited the rising\r\npoet to be his guest for some days, and made him read his tragedy of\r\n“Atreus.” Pacuvius criticised it kindly, fairly praised the grandeur of\r\nthe poetry, but said that it was somewhat harsh and hard. “You are\r\nright,” replied Attius, “but I hope to improve. Fruits which are at\r\nfirst hard and sour, become soft and mellow, but those which begin by\r\nbeing soft, end in being rotten.” Valerius Maximus[265] relates that in\r\nthe assemblies of the poets he refused to rise at the entrance of J.\r\nCæsar, because he felt that in the republic of letters he was the\r\nsuperior. If this anecdote is genuine, it does not prove that the aged\r\npoet was guilty of unwarrantable self-esteem, for Cæsar must then have\r\nbeen quite a youth, and if he had any claim to reputation as a poet, he\r\nwas, at any rate, not yet distinguished as a warrior or a statesman.\r\nAmongst the great men whose friendship the poet enjoyed was Dec. Brutus,\r\nwho was consul A. U. C. 616.[266] Nothing more is known respecting his\r\nprivate history, except that his parents were freedmen, and that he was\r\none of the colonists settled at Pisaurum, where, in after times, a farm\r\nor estate (fundus Attianus) continued to bear his name. His tragedies\r\nwere very numerous. He is said to have written more than fifty. Three at\r\nleast were _prætextatæ_, their titles being “Brutus,” “The Æneadæ,” or\r\n“Decius,”[267] and “Marcellus.” His “Trachiniæ” and “Phœnissæ” were\r\nalmost translations, the one from Sophocles, the other from Euripides;\r\nthe rest were free imitations of Greek tragedies. They were\r\ndistinguished both for sublimity and pathos; and although he was warmed\r\nby the fiery spirit and tragic grandeur of Æschylus, he evidently\r\nevinced a predilection for Sophocles.[268] His taste is chastened, his\r\nsentiments noble, his versification elegant. His language is almost\r\nclassical, and was deservedly admired by the ancients for its polish as\r\nwell as its vigour. The “Brutus” was written at the suggestion of his\r\nfriend Decimus. The plot was the expulsion of the Tarquins, the hero\r\nBrutus, the heroine Lucretia. He had chosen one of the noblest romances\r\nin Roman history. Two passages,[269] quoted by Cicero, are all that\r\nremain of this national tragedy. In them the tyrant relates to the\r\naugurs a dream which had haunted him, and they, at his request, give\r\ntheir interpretation of it. Varro has also preserved the soliloquy of\r\nHercules in the agonies of death, from the Trachiniæ,[270] a noble\r\nparaphrase of Sophocles. This fine specimen of his genius extends to the\r\nlength of forty-five lines. In another passage, Philoctetes pours forth\r\nhis sufferings in language as touching as the original Greek; and in a\r\nthird, Prometheus, now delivered from the tyranny of Jupiter, addresses\r\nto his assembled Titans a strain of indignant eloquence not unworthy of\r\nÆschylus.[271] The following lines from the “Phœnissæ” and the\r\n“Complaint of Philoctetes,” are, though brief, fair examples of his\r\nlanguage and versification:——\r\n\r\n              Sol, qui micantem candido curru atque equis\r\n              Flammam citatis fervido ardore explicas,\r\n              Quianam tam adverso augurio et inimico omine\r\n              Thebis radiatum lumen ostendis tuum![272]\r\n\r\n              Heu! quis salsis fluctibus mandet\r\n              Me ex sublimi vertice saxi,\r\n              Jamjam absumor; conficit animam\r\n              Vis volneris, ulceris æstus.[273]\r\n\r\nThese are the most important of the numerous fragments which are extant\r\nof the various tragedies of the lofty Attius.[274] He has been\r\nconsidered by some as the founder of the _Tragœdia Prætextatæ_. This,\r\nhowever, is not true, for there is no doubt that such dramas were\r\nwritten by his predecessors. Nevertheless, he brought the natural\r\ntragedy to its highest state of perfection.\r\n\r\nThe time was now evidently approaching when the Romans were beginning to\r\nshow, that although they did not possess the inventive genius of the\r\nGreeks, they were capable of stripping their native language of its\r\nrudeness, and of transferring into it the beauties of Greek thought;\r\nthat they were no longer mere servile copyists, but could use Greek\r\npoetry as furnishing suggestions for original efforts. They could not\r\nquarry for themselves, but they could now build up Greek materials into\r\na glowing and polished edifice, of which the details were new and the\r\neffect original.\r\n\r\nThe metres which Attius used were chiefly the iambic trimeter and the\r\nanapæstic dimeter, but his _prætextatæ_ were written in trochaic and\r\niambic tetrameters, the rhythm of which proves that his ear was more\r\nrefined than that of his predecessors.[275]\r\n\r\nIt is not known whether he was the author of any comedies, but he was a\r\nhistorian, an antiquarian, and a critic, as well as a poet. He left\r\nbehind him a review of dramatic poetry, entitled “_Libri Didascalion_,”\r\n“Roman Annals,” in verse, and two other works—“_Libri Pragmaticon_,” and\r\n“_Parerga_.” The former of these is quoted by Nonius, and A. Gellius. He\r\ndied at an advanced age, probably about A. U. C. 670, and is thus a\r\nlink, as it were, which connects the first literary period with the age\r\nof Cicero; for the great orator was personally acquainted with him, and\r\nat his death must have been about twenty-two years of age.\r\n\r\nWith Attius Latin tragedy disappeared. The tragedies of the third period\r\nwere written expressly for reading and recitation, and not for the\r\nstage. They may have deserved the commendations which they obtained, but\r\nthe merit and talent which they displayed were simply rhetorical, and\r\nnot dramatic; they were dramatic poems, not dramas.\r\n\r\nThe state of political affairs, which synchronized with the death of\r\nAttius, was less congenial than ever to the tragic muse. Real and bloody\r\ntragedies were being enacted, and there was no room in the heart of the\r\nRoman people for fictitious woes. If it was improbable that a people who\r\ndelighted in the sanguinary scenes of the amphitheatre should sympathize\r\nwith the sorrows of a hero in tragedy, it was almost impossible that\r\ntragedy should flourish when Rome itself was a theatre in which scenes\r\nof horror were daily enacted.\r\n\r\nEither then, or not long before, the terrible domination of Cinna and\r\nMarius had begun. Massacre and violence raged through the streets of\r\nRome. The best and noblest fell victims to the raging thirst for blood.\r\nThe aged Marius, distracted by unscrupulous ambition and savage\r\npassions, died amidst the delirious ravings of remorse, and thus made\r\nway for the tyranny of his perjured accomplice Cinna. Still there was no\r\nrespite or interruption. The cruel Sulla sent his orders from Antemnæ to\r\nslaughter 8,000 prisoners in cold blood. The massacre had hardly begun\r\nwhen he himself arrived, had taken his place in the Senate; and the\r\nshrieks of his murdered victims were audible in the house whilst he was\r\ncoolly speaking. This was the beginning of horrors: the notorious\r\nproscription followed. Besides other victims, 5,600 Roman knights\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nAmidst such scenes as these, the voice of the tragic muse was hushed.\r\nDepending for her very existence on the breath of popular favour, she\r\nnecessarily could not find supporters, and so languished and was\r\nsilenced. It might appear surprising that literature of any kind should\r\nhave lived through such times of savage barbarism. But other literature\r\nis not dependent upon public patronage: it finds a refuge beneath the\r\nshelter of the private dwelling. The literary man finds friends and\r\npatrons amongst those who, devoted to the humanities of intellectual\r\npursuits, shuns the scenes of revolutionary strife and the struggles of\r\nselfish ambition. Even Sulla himself had a polished and refined taste;\r\nand, when he resigned the Dictatorship, passed those hours of retirement\r\nin literary studies which were not devoted to depravity and\r\nlicentiousness.\r\n\r\nThe style in which the Roman theatres were built, indicate that whatever\r\ntaste for tragedy the Roman people possessed had now decayed. The huge\r\nedifice erected by Pompey was too vast for the exhibition of tragedy.\r\nThe forty thousand spectators which it contained could scarcely hear the\r\nactor, still less could they see the expression of human passions and\r\nemotions. The two theatres, placed on pivots, back to back, so that they\r\ncould be wheeled round and form one vast amphitheatre, show how an\r\ninterest in the drama was shared with the passion for spectacle; and\r\nprovision was thus publicly made for gratifying that corrupt taste which\r\nhad arrived at its zenith in the time of Horace, and, as we have seen,\r\ninterrupted even comedy so early as the times of Terence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SATIRE.\r\n\r\nThe invention of satire is universally attributed to the Romans, and\r\nthis assertion is true as far as the external form is concerned; but the\r\nspirit of satire is found in many parts of the literature of Greece. It\r\nanimated the Homeric Margites, the poem on woman by Simonides, the\r\nbitter lyrical iambics of Archilochus, Stesichorus’ attack on Helen, and\r\nespecially, as Horace says, the old comedy of Eupolis, Cratinus, and\r\nAristophanes. Some resemblance may also be discerned between Roman\r\nsatire and the Greek Silli, poems belonging to the declining period of\r\nGreek literature,[276] the design of which was to attack vice and folly\r\nwith severe ridicule.[277]\r\n\r\nSatire is, in fact, if Horace may be believed, the form which comedy\r\ntook amongst the people with whom the drama did not flourish. Ennius was\r\nthe inventor of the name, but Lucilius[278] was the father of satire, in\r\nthe proper sense, and was at Rome what the writers of the old comedy\r\nwere at Athens. It subsequently occupied a wider field: Persius and\r\nJuvenal confined themselves to its didactic purpose, but Horace made it\r\na vehicle for the narration of amusing adventure, and picturesque\r\ndescriptions of human life.\r\n\r\nThe Satires of Lucilius mark an era in Roman literature, and prove that\r\na love for this species of poetry had already made great progress.\r\nHitherto, science, literature, and art, had been considered the province\r\nof slaves and freedmen. The stern old Roman virtue despised such\r\nsedentary and inactive employment as intellectual cultivation, and\r\nthought it unworthy of the warrior and statesman. Some of the higher\r\nclasses loved literature and patronised it, but did not make it their\r\npursuit. Cato blamed M. Fulvius Nobilior for being accompanied by poets\r\nwhen he proceeded to his provincial government,[279] and did not until\r\nadvanced in years undertake to study Greek.[280] C. Lucilius was by\r\nbirth of equestrian rank, the first Roman knight who was himself a\r\npoet.[281] He was born at Suessa Aurunca, B. C. 148,[282] and lived to\r\nthe age of forty-six years.[283] At fourteen, he served under Scipio at\r\nthe siege of Numantia.[284] He was the maternal great-uncle of Pompey,\r\nand numbered amongst his friends and patrons, Africanus and Lælius. His\r\nSatires were comprised in thirty books, of which the first twenty and\r\nthe thirtieth were written in hexameters, the rest in iambics or\r\ntrochaics. Numerous fragments are still extant, some of considerable\r\nlength. The Satires were probably arranged according to their\r\nsubject-matter; for those in the first book are on topics connected with\r\nreligion, whilst those in the ninth treat of literary and grammatical\r\ncriticism. His versification is careless and unrefined; very inferior in\r\nthis respect to that of his predecessors. He sets at defiance the laws\r\nof prosody, and almost returns to the usage of that period in which the\r\near was the only judge.\r\n\r\nThe prejudices of Horace[285] against the ancient Roman literature\r\nrender him an unsafe guide in criticism. Even in his own time his\r\nattacks were considered by some indefensible; but his strictures on the\r\nstyle of Lucilius are not undeserved; it was unmusical, affected, and\r\nincorrect. His sentences are frequently ill-arranged, and therefore\r\ndeficient in perspicuity. His mixture of Greek and Latin expressions,\r\nwithout that skill and art with which Horace considered it allowable to\r\nenrich the vernacular language, is itself offensive to good taste, and\r\nis rendered still more disagreeable by unnecessary diminutives and\r\nforced alliteration. On these grounds, and on these alone, he merits the\r\ncontemptuous criticism of Horace.\r\n\r\nHis real defect was want of facility; and it is not improbable that, if\r\nprose had been considered a legitimate vehicle, he would have preferred\r\npouring forth in that unrestricted form his indignant eloquence, rather\r\nthan that, as Horace says, every verse should have cost him many\r\nscratchings of the head, and biting his nails to the quick. Whilst the\r\ncriticism of Horace errs on the side of severity, that of Cicero[286] is\r\nsomewhat too partial: firstly, because he himself was deficient in\r\npoetical facility; secondly, because in his time there were no models of\r\nperfection wherewith to compare the works of Lucilius. The judgment of\r\nQuintilian[287] is moderate; and although the taste for poetry was then\r\ncorrupted by a love of quietness and rhetorical affectation, the praise\r\nis well merited which he bestows on the frank honesty and biting wit of\r\nthe Satires of Lucilius. As he took the writers of old Attic comedy for\r\nhis models, it cannot be a matter of surprise that he occasionally added\r\nforce to his attacks on vice by coarseness and personality. Like them,\r\nif Lucilius found any one who deserved rebuke for his crimes, he did not\r\ntrouble himself to make general remarks, and to attack vice in the\r\nabstract, but to illustrate his principles by living examples.\r\n\r\nThe education of Lucilius had probably been desultory, and his course of\r\nstudy not sufficiently strict to give the rich young Roman knight the\r\naccurate training, the critical knowledge, necessary to make him a poet\r\nas well as a satirist. It had given him learning and erudition—it had\r\nfurnished him with the wealth of two languages, both of which he used\r\nwhenever he thought they supplied him with a two-edged weapon—but it had\r\nnot sufficiently cultivated his ear and refined his taste. On the other\r\nhand, his Satires must have possessed nobler qualities than those of\r\nstyle. He was evidently a man of high moral principle, though stern and\r\nstoical, devotedly attached to the cause of virtue, a relentless enemy\r\nof vice and profligacy, a gallant and fearless defender of truth and\r\nhonesty. He must have felt with Juvenal, “difficile est satiram non\r\nscribere.” He was under an obligation which he could not avoid. What\r\ncared he for correct tetrameters, or heroics, or senarii, so that he\r\ncould crush effeminacy, and gluttony, and self-indulgence, and restore\r\nthe standard of ancient morals, to which he looked back with admiration?\r\n\r\nThis chivalrous devotion inspired him with eloquence, and gave a dignity\r\nto his rude verses, although it did not invest them with the graces and\r\ncharms of poetry. Nor is it only when he declares open war against\r\ncorruption that he must have made his adversaries tremble, or his\r\nvictims, conscience-stricken, writhe beneath his knife. His encomiums\r\nupon virtue form as striking pictures; but in both it is the masterly\r\noutline of the drawing which amazes and instructs, not the mere\r\naccessory of the colouring. See, for example, the following noble\r\npassage, with its unselfish conclusion, preserved by Lactantius:[288]—\r\n\r\n         Virtus, Albine, est pretium persolvere verum\r\n         Queis in versamur, queis vivimu’ rebu’ potesse.\r\n         Virtus est homini scire id quod quæque habeat res.\r\n         Virtus, scire homini rectum, utile, quid sit honestum,\r\n         Quæ bona, quæ mala item quid inutile turpe inhonestum.\r\n         Virtus, quærendæ finem rei scire modumque;\r\n         Virtus, divitiis pretium persolvere posse.\r\n         Virtus, id dare quod reipsa debetur honori,\r\n         Hostem esse atque inimicum hominum morumque malorum;\r\n         Contra, defensorem hominum morumque bonorum;\r\n         Magnificare hos, his bene velle, his vivere amicum;\r\n         Commoda præterea patriai prima putare,\r\n         Deinde parentum, tertia jam postremaque nostra.\r\n\r\nHad they been extant, we should have found useful information and\r\ninstruction in his faithful pictures of Roman life and manners in their\r\nstate of moral transition—amusement in such pieces as his journal of a\r\nprogress from Rome to Capua, from which Horace borrowed the idea of his\r\njourney to Brundisium, whilst in his love poems, addressed to his\r\nmistress, Collyra, we should have traced the tender sympathies of human\r\nnature, which the sternness of stoicism was unable to overcome.\r\n\r\nBesides satire, Lucilius is said to have attempted lyric poetry: if this\r\nbe the case, it is by no means surprising that no specimens have stood\r\nthe test of time, for he possessed none of the qualifications of a lyric\r\npoet.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Lucilius, satire languished. Varro Atacinus attempted\r\nit and failed.[289] Half a century subsequently it assumed a new garb in\r\nthe descriptive scenes of Horace, and put forth its original vigour in\r\nthe burning thoughts of Persius and Juvenal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LÆVIUS.\r\n\r\nThis literary period was entirely destitute of lyric poetry, unless\r\nNiebuhr is correct in supposing that Lævius flourished contemporaneously\r\nwith Lucilius.[290] Nothing is known of his history; and such\r\nuncertainty prevails respecting him that his name is constantly\r\nconfounded with those of Livius and Nævius. It is not improbable, that\r\nsome passages attributed to them, which appear to belong to a later\r\nliterary age, are, in reality, the work of Lævius—for example, the\r\nhexameters which are found in the Latin Odyssey of Livius. He translated\r\nthe Cyprian poems, and wrote some fugitive amatory pieces entitled\r\nErotopægnia. They seem to have possessed neither the graceful simplicity\r\nnor the tender warmth which are essential to lyric poetry, although they\r\nperhaps attained as great elegance of expression as the state of the\r\nlanguage then admitted. Short fragments are preserved by Apuleius and in\r\nthe _Noctes Atticæ_ of A. Gellius.[291]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\nPROSE LITERATURE—PROSE SUITABLE TO ROMAN GENIUS—HISTORY, JURISPRUDENCE,\r\nAND ORATORY—PREVALENCE OF GREEK—Q. FABIUS PICTOR—L. CINCIUS ALIMENTUS—C.\r\nACILIUS GLABRIO—VALUE OF THE ANNALISTS—IMPORTANT LITERARY PERIOD, DURING\r\n   WHICH CATO CENSORIUS FLOURISHED—SKETCH OF HIS LIFE—HIS CHARACTER,\r\n                           GENIUS, AND STYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nProse was far more in accordance with the genius of the Romans than\r\npoetry. As a nation they had little or no ideality or imaginative power,\r\nno enthusiastic love of natural beauty, no acute perception of the\r\nsympathy and relation existing between man and the external world. In\r\nthe Greek mind a love of country and a love of nature held a divided\r\nempire—they were poets as well as patriots. Roman patriotism had indeed\r\nits dark side—an unbounded lust of dominion, an unscrupulous ambition to\r\nextend the power and glory of the republic; but, nevertheless, it\r\nprompted a zealous devotion to whatever would promote national\r\nindependence and social advancement. Statesmanship, therefore, and the\r\nsubjects akin to it, constituted the favourite civil pursuit of an\r\nenlightened Roman, who sought a distinguished career of public\r\nusefulness; and, therefore, that literature which tended to advance the\r\nscience of social life had a charm for him which no other literature\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nThe branches of knowledge which would engage his attention were History,\r\nJurisprudence, and Oratory. They would be studied with a view to\r\nutility, and in a practical spirit they would require a scientific and\r\nnot an artistic treatment; and, therefore, their natural language would\r\nbe prose and not poetry. As matter was more valued than manner by this\r\nutilitarian people, it was long before it was thought necessary to\r\nembellish prose literature with the graces of composition. The earliest\r\norators spoke with a rude and vigorous eloquence which is always\r\ncaptivating: they wrote but little; their style was stiff and dry, and\r\nvery inferior to their speaking. Cato’s prose was less rugged than that\r\nof his contemporaries or even his immediate successors. Sisenna was the\r\nfirst historian to whom gracefulness and polish have been attributed;\r\nand C. Gracchus is spoken of as a single exception to the orators of his\r\nage, on account of the rhythmical modulation of his prose sentences—a\r\nquality which he probably owed not more to a delicate ear than to the\r\nsoftening influence of a mother’s education. Even the prose of that\r\ncelebrated model of refinement and good taste, C. Lælius, was harsh and\r\nunmusical.[292]\r\n\r\nBesides the influence which the practical character of the Roman mind\r\nexercised upon prose writing, it must not be forgotten that Roman\r\nliterature was imitative: its end and object, therefore, were not\r\ninvention, but erudition; it depended for its existence on learning, and\r\nwas almost synonymous with it. This principle gave a decidedly\r\nhistorical bias to the Roman intellect: an historical taste pervades a\r\ngreat portion of the national literature. There is a manifest tendency\r\nto study subjects in an historical point of view. It will be seen\r\nhereafter that it is not like the Greek, original and inventive, but\r\nerudite and eclectic. The historic principle is the great characteristic\r\nfeature of the Roman mind; consequently, in this branch of literature,\r\nthe Romans attained the highest reputation, and may fairly stand forth\r\nas competitors with their Greek instructors. Not that they ever entirely\r\nequalled them; for though they were practical, vigorous, and just\r\nthinkers, they never attained that comprehensive and philosophical\r\nspirit which distinguished the Greek historians.\r\n\r\nThe work of an historian was, in the earliest times, recognised as not\r\nunworthy of a Roman. It was not like the other branches of literature,\r\nin which the example was first set by slaves and freedmen. Those who\r\nfirst devoted themselves to the pursuit were also eminent in the public\r\nservice of their country. Fabius Pictor was of an illustrious patrician\r\nfamily. Cincius Alimentus, Fulvius Nobilior, and others, were of free\r\nand honourable birth. Such were Roman historians until the time of\r\nSulla; for L. Otacilius Pilitus, who flourished at that period, was the\r\nfirst freedman who began to write history.[293][294]\r\n\r\nAgain, the science of jurisprudence formed an indispensable part of\r\nstatesmanship. It was a study which recommended itself by its practical\r\nnature: it could not be stigmatized even by the busiest as an idle and\r\nfrivolous pursuit, whilst the constitutional relation which subsisted\r\nbetween patron and client, rendered the knowledge of its principles, to\r\na certain extent, absolutely necessary. Protection from wrong was the\r\ngreatest boon which the strong could confer upon the weak, the learned\r\non the unlearned. It was, therefore, the most efficacious method of\r\ngaining grateful and attached friends; and by their support, the direct\r\npath was opened to the highest political positions. It is not,\r\ntherefore, to be wondered at that, even when elegant literature was in\r\nits infancy, so many names are found of men illustrious as jurists and\r\nlawyers.\r\n\r\nPractical statesmanship, in like manner, gave an early encouragement to\r\noratory. It is peculiarly the literature of active life. The possession\r\nof eloquence rendered a man more efficient as a soldier and as a\r\ncitizen. Great as is the force of native, unadorned eloquence, vigorous\r\ncommon sense, honest truthfulness, and indignant passion, nature would\r\ngive way to art as taste became more cultivated. Nor could the Romans\r\nlong have the finished models of Greek eloquence before their eyes,\r\nwithout transferring to the forum or the senate-house somewhat of their\r\nsimple grandeur and majestic beauty.\r\n\r\nThe first efforts of the Roman historians were devoted to the transfer\r\nof the records of poetry into prose, as their more appropriate and\r\npopular vehicle. The national lays which tradition had handed down were\r\nthe storehouses which they ransacked to furnish a supply of materials.\r\nAs far as the records of authentic history are concerned, they performed\r\nthe functions of simple annalists: they related events almost in the\r\nstyle of public monuments, without any attempt at ornament, without\r\npicturesque detail or political reflection. When Cicero compares the\r\nstyle of Fabius Pictor, Cato, and Piso, to that of the old Greek\r\nlogographers,[295] Pherecydes, Hellanicus, and Acusilaus, the points of\r\nresemblance which he instances are, that both neglected ornament, were\r\ncareful only that their statements should be intelligible, and thought\r\nthe chief excellence of a writer was brevity. Probably the\r\nsubject-matter of the Roman annalists was the more valuable, whilst the\r\nGreeks had the advantage in liveliness and skill. Some of the earliest\r\nhistorians wrote in Greek instead of Latin. Even, in later times, such\r\nmen as Sulla and Lucullus, and also Cn. Aufidius, who flourished during\r\nthe boyhood of Cicero, wrote their memoirs in a foreign tongue. There\r\nwas some reason for this. The language in which the higher classes\r\nreceived their education was Greek—the tutors, even the nurses, were\r\nGreek, as well as the librarians, secretaries, and confidential servants\r\nin most distinguished families. Such was the humanizing spirit of\r\nliterature that these distinguished foreigners found an asylum in the\r\nhouseholds of noble Romans, notwithstanding the severity with which the\r\nlaw treated prisoners of war. Fashionable conversation, moreover, was\r\ninterlarded with Greek phrases, and, in some houses, Greek was\r\nhabitually spoken. Even so late as the times of Cicero,[296] Greek\r\nliterature was read and studied in almost every part of the civilized\r\nworld, while the works of Latin writers were only known within the\r\ncircumscribed limits of Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Q. FABIUS PICTOR.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient prose writer of Roman history was Q. Fabius Pictor, the\r\ncontemporary of Nævius. He belonged to that branch of the noble house of\r\nthe Fabii, which derived its distinguishing appellation from the\r\neminence of its founder as a painter. The temple of Salus, which he\r\npainted, was dedicated B. C. 302, by the dictator, C. Junius Bubulcus;\r\nand this oldest known specimen of Roman fine art remained until the\r\nconflagration of the temple in the reign of Claudius. It must,\r\ntherefore, have been subjected to the criticisms of an age capable of\r\nforming a correct judgment respecting its merits; and it appears from\r\nthe testimony of antiquity to have possessed the two essentials of\r\naccurate drawing and truthful colouring, and to have been free from the\r\nfault of conventional treatment.[297]\r\n\r\nThe Fabii were an intellectual family as well as a distinguished one:\r\nperhaps the numerous records of their exploits which exist were, in some\r\ndegree, owing to their learning. The grandson of the eminent artist was\r\nFabius Pictor the historian. Livy[298] continually refers to him, and\r\nthroughout his narrative of the Hannibalian war, he professes implicit\r\nconfidence in him on the grounds of his being a contemporary\r\nhistorian,[299] (_æqualem temporibus hujusce belli_;) he is likewise the\r\nauthority on whom the greatest reliance was placed by Dion Cassius and\r\nAppian. Nor did the accurate and faithful Polybius consider him\r\notherwise than trustworthy upon the whole, although he accuses him of\r\npartiality towards his countrymen.[300] Niebuhr[301] attributes to\r\nFabius Pictor the accurate knowledge of constitutional history displayed\r\nby Dion Cassius, and acknowledges how deeply we are indebted to him for\r\nthe information which we possess concerning the changes which took place\r\nin the Roman constitution. It is to his care that we owe the\r\nfaithfulness of Dion, whilst Dionysius and Livy too often lead us\r\nastray. It constitutes some justification of his partiality as an\r\nhistorian, that Philinus of Agrigentum had also written a history of the\r\nfirst Punic war in a spirit hostile to Rome, and that this provoked\r\nPictor to a defence of his country’s honour. His work was written in\r\nGreek, and its principal subject was a history of the first and second\r\nPunic wars, especially that against Hannibal. It has been held by some,\r\non the authority of a passage in the “De Oratore” of Cicero,[302] that\r\nhe wrote in Latin as well as in Greek; but Niebuhr believes that Cicero\r\nis in error, and has confused him with a Latin annalist, named F. Max.\r\nServilianus. The period to which his work extended is uncertain; but the\r\nlast event alluded to by Livy, on his authority, is the battle of\r\nTrasymenus,[303] and the last occasion on which he mentions his name is\r\nwhen he records his return from an embassy to Delphi in the following\r\nyear.[304] The earlier history of Rome was prefixed by way of\r\nintroduction; for his object was not merely to assist in constructing\r\nthe rising edifice of Roman literature, but to spread the glory of his\r\ncountry throughout that other great nation of antiquity, which now, for\r\nthe first time, came in contact with a worthy rival. The pontifical\r\nannals, the national ballads, the annals of his own house, so rich in\r\nlegendary tales of heroism, furnished him with ample materials; but he\r\nis also said to have drawn largely on the stores of a Greek author,\r\nnamed Diocles, a native of Peparethus, who had preceded him in the work\r\nof research and accumulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         L. CINCIUS ALIMENTUS.\r\n\r\nContemporary with Fabius was the other annalist of the second Punic war,\r\nL. Cincius Alimentus. He was prætor in Sicily[305] in the ninth year of\r\nthe war, and took a prominent part in it.[306] The soldiers who fought\r\nat Cannæ[307] were placed at his disposal, his period of command was\r\nprolonged, and after his return home he was sent as _legatus_ to the\r\nconsul Crispinus, on the occasion of the melancholy death of his\r\ncolleague, Marcellus.[308] Some time after this, he was taken prisoner\r\nby Hannibal.[309] Like Fabius, he wrote his work in Greek, and prefixed\r\nto it a brief abstract of early Roman history.[310] Livy speaks of him\r\nas a diligent antiquarian, and appeals to his authority to establish the\r\nEtruscan origin of the custom of the dictator driving a nail into the\r\ntemple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.[311] As his accurate investigation of\r\noriginal monuments gives a credibility to his early history, so his\r\nbeing personally engaged in the war in a high position, renders him\r\ntrustworthy in the later periods. It is also said that, when he was a\r\nprisoner of war, Hannibal, who delighted in the society of literary men,\r\ntreated him with great kindness and consideration, and himself\r\ncommunicated to him the details of his passage across the Alps into\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nTo him, therefore, and to the opportunities which he enjoyed of gaining\r\ninformation, we owe the credibility of this portion of Livy’s\r\nhistory[312] on a point on which authors were at variance, namely, the\r\nnumber of Hannibal’s forces at this time. Livy appeals to the statement\r\nof Cincius as settling the question, and says, Hannibal himself informed\r\nCincius how many troops he had lost between the passage of the Rhone and\r\nhis descent into Italy.\r\n\r\nHis accurate habit of mind must have made his annals a most valuable\r\nwork; and, therefore, it was most important that the variation of his\r\nearly chronology from that which is commonly received should be\r\nexplained and reconciled. This task Niebuhr has satisfactorily\r\naccomplished. He supposes that Cincius took cyclical years of ten\r\nmonths, which were used previous to the reign of Tarquinius Priscus, in\r\nthe place of common years of twelve months. The time which had elapsed\r\nbetween the building of Rome and this epoch was, according to the\r\npontifical annals, 132 years. The error, therefore, due to this\r\nmiscalculation would be 132 - (132 + 10) / 12 = 22 years. If this be\r\nadded to the common date of the building of Rome, B. C. 753 = Ol. vii.\r\n2, the result is the date given by Cincius, namely Ol. vii. 4.[313]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          C. ACILIUS GLABRIO.\r\n\r\nA few words may be devoted to C. Acilius Glabrio, the third\r\nrepresentative of the Græco-Roman historic literature. Very little is\r\nknown respecting him. He was quæstor A. U. C. 551, tribune A. U. C. 557,\r\nand subsequently attained senatorial rank; for Gellius[314] relates\r\nthat, when the three Athenian philosophers visited Rome as ambassadors,\r\nAcilius introduced them to the senate and acted as interpreter. His\r\nstory was considered worthy of translation by an author named Claudius,\r\nand to this translation reference is twice made by Livy.[315]\r\n\r\nValuable though the works of these annalists must have been as\r\nhistorical records, and as furnishing materials for more thoughtful and\r\nphilosophical minds, they are only such as could have existed in the\r\ninfancy of a national literature. They were a bare compilation of facts,\r\nthe mere scaffolding and framework of history; they were diversified by\r\nno critical remarks or political reflections. The authors made no use of\r\ntheir facts, either to deduce or to illustrate principles. With respect\r\nto style, they were meager, insipid, and jejune.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       M. PORCIUS CATO CENSORIUS.\r\n\r\nThe versatility and variety of talent displayed by Cato claim for him a\r\nplace amongst orators, jurists, economists, and historians. It is,\r\nhowever, amongst the latter, as representatives of the highest branch of\r\nprose literature, that we must speak of the author of the “Origines.”\r\nHis life extends over a wide and important period of literary history:\r\neverything was in a state of change—morals, social habits, literary\r\ntaste. Not only the influence of Greek literature, but also that of the\r\nmoral and metaphysical creed of Greek philosophy, was beginning to be\r\nfelt when Cato’s manly and powerful intellect was flourishing. When he\r\nfilled the second public office to which the Roman citizen aspired,\r\nNævius was still living. He was censor when Plautus died; and, before\r\nhis own life ended, the comedies of Terence had been exhibited on the\r\nRoman stage.\r\n\r\nThree political events took place during his lifetime, which must have\r\nexercised an important influence on the mental condition of the Roman\r\npeople. When Macedonia, at the defeat of Perseus,[316] was reduced to\r\nthe condition of a Roman province, nearly a thousand Achæans, amongst\r\nwhom was the historian Polybius, were sent to Rome, and detained in\r\nItaly as hostages during nearly seventeen years. The thirteenth year\r\nfrom that event witnessed the dawn of philosophy at Rome, for previously\r\nto this epoch, the philosophical schools of Magna Græcia appear to have\r\nbeen unnoticed and disregarded. But now[317] Carneades the academic,\r\nCritolaus the peripatetic, and Diogenes the stoic,[318] came to Rome as\r\nambassadors from Athens, and delivered philosophical lectures, which\r\nattracted the attention of the leading statesmen, whilst the doctrines\r\nwhich they taught excited universal alarm. The following year Crates\r\narrived as ambassador from Attalus, king of Pergamus, and during his\r\nstay delighted the literary society of the capital with commentaries on\r\nthe Greek poets.[319] It is not surprising that one who lived through a\r\nperiod during which Greek literature had such favourable opportunities\r\nof being propagated by some of its most distinguished professors,\r\nsufficiently overcame his prejudices as to learn in his old age the\r\nlanguage of a people whom he both hated and despised.\r\n\r\nM. Porcius Cato Censorius was born at Tusculum, B. C. 234.[320] His\r\nfamily was of great antiquity, and numbered amongst its members many who\r\nwere distinguished for their courage in war and their integrity in\r\npeace. His boyhood was passed in the healthy pursuits of rural life, at\r\na small Sabine farm belonging to his father; and his mind, invigorated\r\nby stern and hardy training, was early directed to the study as well as\r\nthe practice of agriculture. To this rugged yet honest discipline may be\r\ntraced the features of his character as displayed in after life, his\r\nprejudices as well as his virtues.\r\n\r\nHe became a soldier at a very early age, B. C. 217, served in the\r\nHannibalian war, was under the command of Fabius Maximus both in\r\nCampania and Tarentum, and did good service at the decisive battle of\r\nthe Metaurus. Between his campaigns he did not seek to exhibit his\r\nlaurels in the society of the capital, but, like Curius Dentatus and\r\nQuintius Cincinnatus, employed himself in the rural labours of his\r\nSabine retirement.\r\n\r\nHis shrewd remarks and easy conversation, as well as the skill with\r\nwhich he pleaded the causes of his clients before the rural magistracy,\r\nsoon made his abilities known, and his reputation attracted the notice\r\nof one of his country neighbours, L. Valerius Flaccus, who invited him\r\nto his town-house at Rome. Owing to the patronage of his noble friend,\r\nand his own merits, his rise to eminence as a pleader was rapid. He was\r\na quæstor in B. C. 206, ædile in B. C. 199, prætor the following year,\r\nand in B. C. 195 he obtained the consulship, his patron Flaccus being\r\nnow his colleague. His province was Spain;[321] and, whilst stern and\r\npitiless towards his foes, he exhibited a noble example of self-denying\r\nendurance in order to minister to the welfare of his army. At the\r\nconclusion of his consulship, he served as legatus in Thrace and Greece;\r\nand in B. C. 189 was sent on a civil mission to Fulvius Nobilior in\r\nÆtolia.\r\n\r\nAfter experiencing one failure, he was elected censor in B. C. 184; and\r\nhe had now an opportunity of making a return for the obligations which\r\nhis earliest patron had conferred upon him; for, by his influence,\r\nFlaccus was appointed his colleague. This office was, above all others,\r\nsuited to his talents; and to his remarkable activity in the discharge\r\nof his duties, he owes his fame and his surname.\r\n\r\nHe had now full scope for displaying his habits of business, his talents\r\nfor administration, his uncompromising resistance to all luxury and\r\nextravagance, his fearlessness in the reformation of abuses: and though\r\nhe was severe, public opinion bore testimony to his integrity, for he\r\nwas rewarded with a statue and an inscription. He had now served his\r\ncountry in every capacity, but still he gave himself no rest; advancing\r\nage did not weaken his energies; he was always ready as the champion of\r\nthe oppressed, the advocate of virtue, the punisher of vice. He\r\nprosecuted the extortionate governors of his old province, Spain.[322]\r\nHe pleaded before the senate the cause of the loyal Rhodians.\r\n\r\nHe caused the courteous dismissal of the three Greek philosophers,\r\nbecause the arguments of Carneades made it difficult to discern what was\r\ntruth.[323] Although his prejudice against Greeks prevented him\r\nsympathizing with the sorrows of the Achæan exiles, he supported the\r\nvote for their restoration to their native land. Neither his enemies nor\r\nhis country would allow him rest. In his eighty-sixth year, he had to\r\ndefend himself against a capital charge. In his eighty-ninth, he was\r\nsent to Africa as one of the arbitrators between the Carthaginians and\r\nMassinissa,[324] and in his ninetieth, the year in which he died,[325]\r\nhis last public act was the prosecution of Galba for his perfidious\r\ntreatment of the conquered Lusitanians.[326]\r\n\r\nCato loved strife, and his long life was one continued combat. He never\r\nfound a task too difficult, because difficulty called forth all his\r\nenergies, and his strong will and invincible perseverance insured\r\nsuccess. His inherent love of truth made him hate anything conventional.\r\nAs a politician, he considered rank valueless, except it depended upon\r\npersonal merit; and therefore he was an unrelenting enemy of the\r\naristocracy. As a moralist, he indignantly rejected that false gloss of\r\nmodern fashion which was superseding the old plainness, and which was,\r\nin his opinion, the foundation of his country’s glory. In literature, he\r\ndistrusted and condemned every thing Greek, because he confounded the\r\nsentiments of its noblest periods as a nation with those of the\r\ndegenerate Greeks with whom he came in contact. But, at length, his\r\ncandid and truthful disposition discovered and confessed his error on\r\nthis point, and his prejudices gave way before conviction.\r\n\r\nCato, with all his virtues, was a hard-hearted man.[327] He had no\r\namiability, no love, no affection; he did not love right, for he loved\r\nnothing; but he had a burning indignation against wrong. This was the\r\nmainspring of his conduct. He did not feel for the oppressed, but he\r\ndeclared war against the oppressor. He never could sympathize with\r\nliving men. In his youth, all his admiration was for the past\r\ngeneration. In his old age, his feeling was that his life had been spent\r\nwith the past, and he had nothing in common with the present.\r\n\r\nAs is usually the case with those who live during a period of\r\ntransition, his feelings were so interested in that past by which his\r\ncharacter was formed, that he was incapable of discerning any good\r\nwhatever in change and progress. For this reason he dreaded the invasion\r\nof refinement and civilization. Accustomed to connect virtue and purity\r\nwith the absence of temptations, he was prepared to take an exaggerated\r\nview of the relation between polish and effeminacy, between a taste for\r\nthe beautiful and luxury.\r\n\r\nHe was a bitter hater of those who opposed his prejudices. His enmity to\r\nCarthage sprung much more from his antagonism to Scipio, as the leader\r\nof the Greek or movement party, than from fears for the safety of Rome.\r\nScipio said, Let Carthage be; therefore Cato’s will was, let Carthage be\r\ndestroyed. When his hatred of injustice was aroused, as, for example, by\r\nthe perfidy of S. Sulpicius Galba towards the Lusitanians, he could\r\nsupport the cause of foreigners against a fellow-countryman. His\r\ncharacter is full of apparent inconsistencies. Although he hated\r\noppression, he was cruel to his slaves; tyrannical and implacable,\r\nsimply because he would not brook opposition to his will. His integrity\r\nwas incorruptible, and yet he was a grinding usurer; frugal in his\r\nhabits, and notwithstanding his few wants, grasping and avaricious; but\r\nit was his love of business that he was gratifying, rather than a love\r\nof money. Trade was with him a combat in which he would not allow an\r\nadvantage to be gained by his adversary. Virtue did not present itself\r\nto Cato in an amiable form. He had but one idea of it—austerity; and, as\r\nhis hatred of wrong was not counterbalanced by a love of right, the\r\nintensity of his hatred was only kept in check by the practical good\r\nsense and utilitarian views which occupy so prominent a place in the\r\nRoman character. Being himself reserved and undemonstrative, he expected\r\nothers to be so likewise, and thought it unbecoming the dignity of a\r\nRoman to exhibit tenderness of feeling. On one occasion we are told that\r\nhe degraded a Roman knight for embracing his wife in the presence of his\r\ndaughter. His personal appearance was not more prepossessing than his\r\nmanners, as we learn from the following severe epigram:—[328]\r\n\r\n             Πυῤῥὸν, πανδακέτην, γλαυκόμματον, οὐδὲ θανόντα\r\n             Πόρκιον εἰς ἀΐδην Περσεφόνη δέχεται.\r\n\r\n  With his red hair, constant snarl, and gray eyes, Proserpine would not\r\n  receive Porcius, even after death, into Hades.\r\n\r\nAs, notwithstanding his defects, Cato was morally the greatest man ever\r\nRome produced, so he was one of the greatest intellectually. His genius\r\nwas perfectly original; his character was not moulded by other men; he\r\nhad no education except self-education. He had immense power of\r\nacquiring learning, and he ransacked every source to increase his\r\nstores; but he was indebted to no man for his opinions—they were\r\nself-formed, except those which he inherited, and in which his own\r\nindependent convictions led him to acquiesce. He had the ability and the\r\ndetermination to excel in everything which he undertook, politics, war,\r\nrural economy, oratory, history. His style is rude, unpolished,\r\nungraceful, because to him wit was artifice, and polish superficial, and\r\ntherefore unreal. For this reason he did not profit by the inconceivably\r\nrapid change which was then taking place in the Latin language, and\r\nwhich is evident from the comparison of the fragments of Cato’s works\r\nwith the polished comedies of Terence.\r\n\r\nHis statements, however, were clear and transparent; his illustrations,\r\nthough quaint, were striking; the words with which he enriched his\r\nnative tongue were full of meaning; his wit was keen and lively,\r\nalthough he never would permit it to offend against gravity, or partake\r\nof irreverence.[329] His arguments went straight to the intellect, and\r\ncarried conviction with them.\r\n\r\nThe character of Cato forms one of the most beautiful passages in the\r\nworks of Livy:[330] “In hoc viro tanta vis animi ingeniique fuit, ut,\r\nquocunque loco natus esset, fortunam sibi ipse facturus fuisse\r\nvideretur. Nulla ars, neque privatæ, neque publicæ rei gerendæ, ei\r\ndefuit. Urbanas rusticasque res pariter callebat. Ad summos honores\r\nalios scientia juris, alios eloquentia, alios gloria militaris provexit.\r\nHuic versatile ingenium sic pariter ad omnia fuit, ut natum ad id unum\r\ndiceres, quodcunque ageret. In bello manu fortissimus, multisque\r\ninsignibus clarus pugnis; idem, postquam ad magnos honores pervenit,\r\nsummus imperator: idem in pace, si jus consuleres, peritissimus; si\r\ncausa oranda esset, eloquentissimus. Nec is tantum, cujus lingua vivo eo\r\nviguerit, monumentum eloquentiæ nullum exstet: vivit immo vigetque\r\neloquentia ejus, sacrata scriptis omnis generis. Orationes et pro se\r\nmultæ, et pro aliis et in alios; nam non solum accusando, sed etiam\r\ncausam dicendo, fatigavit inimicos. Simultates nimio plures et\r\nexercuerunt eum, et ipse exercuit eas; nec facile dixeris, utrum magis\r\npresserit eum nobilitas, an ille agitaverit nobilitatem. Asperi\r\nproculdubio animi, et linguæ acerbæ, et immodice liberæ fuit; sed\r\ninvicti a cupiditatibus animi, et rigidæ innocentiæ; contemptor gratiæ\r\ndivitiarum. In parsimonia, in patientia laboris, periculi, ferrei prope\r\ncorporis animique; quam neque senectus quidem, quæ solvit omnia,\r\nfregerit. Qui sextum et octogesimum annum agens causam dixerit, ipse pro\r\nse oraverit, scripseritque; nonagesimo anno Ser. Galbam ad populi\r\nadduxerit judicium.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n     THE ORIGINES OF CATO—PASSAGE QUOTED BY GELLIUS—TREATISE DE RE\r\n    RUSTICA—ORATIONS—L. CASSIUS HEMINA—HISTORIANS IN THE DAYS OF THE\r\n  GRACCHI—TRADITIONAL ANECDOTE OF ROMULUS—AUTOBIOGRAPHERS—FRAGMENT OF\r\n           QUADRIGARIUS—FALSEHOODS OF ANTIAS—SISENNA—TUBERO.\r\n\r\n\r\nCato’s great historical and antiquarian work, “The Origines,” was\r\nwritten in his old age.[331] Its title would seem to imply that it was\r\nmerely an inquiry into the ancient history of his country; but in\r\nreality it comprehended far more than this—it was a history of Italy and\r\nRome from the earliest times to the latest events which occurred in his\r\nown lifetime. The contents of the work are thus described by Cornelius\r\nNepos.[332] It is divided into seven books. The first treats of the\r\nhistory of the kings; the second and third of the rise and progress of\r\nthe Italian states; the fourth contains the first Punic war; the fifth\r\nthe war with Hannibal; the remaining two the history of the subsequent\r\nwars down to the prætorship of Servius Galba.\r\n\r\nIt was a work of great research and originality. For his archæological\r\ninformation, he had consulted the records and documents, not only of\r\nRome, but of the principal Italian towns. It is probable that their\r\nconstitutional history was introduced incidentally to the main\r\nnarrative; and that the rise and progress of the Roman constitution was\r\nillustrated by the political principles of the Italian nations. The\r\n“Origines” also contained valuable notices respecting the history and\r\nconstitution of Carthage,[333] his embassy having furnished him with\r\nfull opportunity for collecting materials. It was, in fact, a unique\r\nwork: no other Roman historian wrote in the same spirit, or was equally\r\nlaborious in the work of original investigation.\r\n\r\nThe truthfulness and honesty of Cato must have rendered the contemporary\r\npart of the history equally valuable with the antiquarian portion. He\r\ncould not have been guilty of flattery, he had no regard for the\r\nfeelings of individuals. Not only he never mentions himself, but, except\r\nin times long gone by, he never names any one.[334] The glory of a\r\nvictory, or of a gallant exploit, belongs to the general, or consul, or\r\ntribune, as the representative of the republic. He does not allow either\r\nindividual or family to participate in that which he considered the\r\nexclusive property of his country.\r\n\r\nSufficient fragments of the “Origines” remain to make us regret that\r\nmore have not been preserved; but though very numerous, they are, with\r\nthe exception of two, excessively brief. One of these is a portion of\r\nhis own speech in favour of the Rhodians;[335] the other a simple and\r\naffecting narrative of an act of self-devoted heroism. A consular army\r\nwas surprised and surrounded by the Carthaginians in a defile, from\r\nwhich there was no escape. The tribune, whom Cato does not name, but\r\nwho, as A. Gellius informs us, was Cædicius, went to the consul and\r\nrecommended him to send four hundred men to occupy a neighbouring\r\nheight. The enemy, he added, will attack them, and without doubt they\r\nwill be slain to a man. Nevertheless, whilst the enemy is thus occupied,\r\nthe army will escape. But, replied the consul, who will be the leader of\r\nthis band? I will, said the tribune; I devote my life to you, and to my\r\ncountry. The tribune and four hundred men set forth to die. They sold\r\ntheir lives dearly, but all fell. “The immortal gods,” adds Cato, for\r\nGellius is here quoting his very words, “granted the tribune a lot\r\naccording to his valour. For thus it came to pass. Though he had\r\nreceived many wounds, none proved mortal; and when his comrades\r\nrecognised him amongst the dead, faint from loss of blood, they took him\r\nup, and he recovered. But it makes a vast difference in what country a\r\ngenerous action is performed. Leonidas, of Lacedæmon, is praised, who\r\nperformed a similar exploit at Thermopylæ. On account of his valour\r\nunited Greece testified her gratitude in every possible way, and adorned\r\nhis exploit with monumental records, pictures, statues, eulogies,\r\nhistories. The Roman tribune gained but faint praise, and yet he had\r\ndone the same, and saved the republic.” The most pathetic writer could\r\nnot have told the tale more effectively than the stern Cato.\r\n\r\nCircumstances invest his treatise “De Re Rustica” with great interest.\r\nThe population of Rome, both patrician and plebeian, was necessarily\r\nagricultural. For centuries they had little commerce: their wealth\r\nconsisted in flocks and herds, and in the conquered territories of\r\nnations as poor as themselves. The _ager Romanus_, and subsequently as\r\nthey gained fresh acquisitions, the fertile plains, and valleys, and\r\nmountain sides of Italy, supplied them with maintenance. The statesman\r\nand the general, in the intervals of civil war or military service,\r\nreturned, like Cincinnatus and Cato, to the cultivation of their fields\r\nand gardens. The Roman armies were recruited from the peasantry; and\r\nwhen the war was over, the soldier returned to his daily labour; and, in\r\nlater times, the veteran, when his period of service was completed,\r\nbecame a small farmer in a military colony. To a restless nation, who\r\ncould not exist in a state of inactivity, a change of labour was\r\nrelaxation; and the pleasures of rural life, which were so often sung by\r\nthe Augustan poets, were heartily enjoyed by the same man whose natural\r\natmosphere seemed to be either politics or war.\r\n\r\nBesides the possession of these rural tastes the Romans were essentially\r\na domestic people. The Greeks were social; they lived in public; they\r\nhad no idea of home. Woman did not with them occupy a position\r\nfavourable to the existence of home-feeling. The Roman matron was the\r\ncentre of the domestic circle; she was her husband’s equal, sometimes\r\nhis counsellor, and generally the educator of his children in their\r\nearly years. Hundreds of sepulchral inscriptions bear testimony to the\r\nsweet charities of home-life, to the dutiful obedience of children, the\r\ndevoted affection of parents, the fidelity of wives, the attachments of\r\nhusbands. Hence, home and all its pursuits and occupations had an\r\ninterest in the eyes of a Roman. For this reason there were so many\r\nwriters on rural and domestic economy. From Cato to Columella we have a\r\nlist of authors whose object was instruction in the various branches of\r\nthe subject. They were thus enumerated by Columella himself:[336] “Cato\r\nwas the first who taught the art of agriculture to speak in Latin; after\r\nhim it was improved by the diligence of the two Sasernæ, father and son;\r\nnext it acquired eloquence from Scrofa Tremellius; polish from M.\r\nTerentius, (Varro;) poetic power from Virgil.” To their illustrious\r\nnames he adds those of J. Hyginus, the Carthaginian Mago, Corn. Celsus,\r\nJ. Atticus, and his disciple J. Græcinus.\r\n\r\nThe work of Cato, “De Re Rustica,” has come down to us almost in form\r\nand substance as it was written. It has not the method of a regular\r\ntreatise. It is a commonplace-book of agriculture and domestic economy\r\nunder one hundred and sixty-three heads. The subjects are connected, but\r\nnot regularly arranged; they form a collection of useful instructions,\r\nhints, and receipts. Its object is utility, not science. It serves the\r\npurposes of a farmers’ and gardeners’ manual; a domestic medicine, an\r\nherbal, and cookery-book; prudential maxims are interspersed, and some\r\nfavourite charms for the cure of diseases in man and beast. Cato teaches\r\nhis readers, for example, how to plant ozier-beds, to cultivate\r\nvegetables, to preserve the health of cattle, to pickle pork, and to\r\nmake savoury dishes. He is shrewd and economical, but he never allows\r\nhumanity to interfere with profits; for he recommends his readers to\r\nsell every thing which they do not want, even old horses and old slaves.\r\nHe is a great conjurer, for he informs us that the most potent cure for\r\na sprain is the repetition of the following hocus-pocus:[337] “Daries\r\ndardaries, astataries dissunapitea;” or, “Huat hanat, huat hista, pista\r\nsista, domiabo damnaustra;” or, “Huat huat, huat, ista sis tar sis,\r\nordannabon damnaustra.” This miscellaneous collection is preceded by an\r\nintroduction, in which is maintained the superiority of agriculture over\r\nother modes of gaining a livelihood, especially over that of trade and\r\nmoney-lending.\r\n\r\nCato was a conscientious father. He could not trust Greeks, but\r\nundertook the education of his son himself. As a part of his system, he\r\naddressed to him, in the form of letters, instruction on various\r\ntopics—historical, philosophical, and moral. A very few fragments of\r\nthis work, unfortunately, remain. In one of them he recommends a cursory\r\nview of Greek literature, but not a profound study of it. He evidently\r\nconsidered Greek writings morally dangerous; but he entertained a still\r\ngreater horror of their medicine. He had confidence in his own\r\nold-fashioned charms and rural pharmacopeia; but he firmly believed, as\r\nhe would the voice of an oracle, that all the Greek physicians were\r\nbanded together to destroy the Romans as barbarians.\r\n\r\nOf the orations of Cato, ninety titles are extant, together with\r\nnumerous fragments.[338] Some of these were evidently judicial, but the\r\nmajority deliberative. After what has been said of his works it is\r\nscarcely necessary to describe the style of his eloquence. Unless a man\r\nis a mere actor, his character is generally exemplified in his speaking.\r\nThis is especially true of Cato. He despised art. He was too fearless\r\nand upright, too confident in the justice of his cause, to be a\r\nrhetorician; too much wrapt up in his subject to be careful of the\r\nlanguage in which he conveyed his thoughts. He imitated no one, and no\r\none was ever able to imitate him. His style was abrupt, concise, witty,\r\nfull of contrast; its beauty that of nature, namely, the rapid\r\nalternations of light and shade. Now it was rude and harsh, now pathetic\r\nand affecting. It was the language of debate—antagonistic, gladiatorial,\r\nelenchtic.\r\n\r\nPlutarch compares him to Socrates; but he omits the principal point of\r\nresemblance, namely, that he always speaks as if he was hand to hand\r\nwith an adversary. Even amidst the glitter and polish of the Augustan\r\nage, old Cato had some admirers.[339] But this was not the general\r\nfeeling. The intrinsic value of the rough gem was not appreciated.\r\nCicero[340] tells us that, to his astonishment, Cato was almost entirely\r\nunknown. The time afterwards arrived when criticism became a science,\r\nand he was estimated as he deserved to be; but this admiration for the\r\nantique form was not a revival of the antique spirit; it was only an\r\nattempt to compensate for its loss; it was an imitation, not a reality.\r\n\r\nSuch was the literary position occupied by him whom Niebuhr pronounces\r\nto be the only great man in his generation, and one of the greatest and\r\nmost honourable characters in Roman history.[341]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           L. CASSIUS HEMINA.\r\n\r\nThere was no one worthy to follow Cato as an historian but L. Cassius\r\nHemina. A. Postumius Albinus, consul B. C. 151, was, according to\r\nCicero,[342] a learned and eloquent man, and wrote a history of Rome in\r\nGreek;[343] but it was so inelegant that he apologized on the ground\r\nthat he was a Roman writing in a foreign language.[344] It is probable,\r\nalso, that he was inaccurate and puerile. He tells us, for example, that\r\nBaiæ was so named after Boia, the nurse of one of Æneas’ friends, and\r\nthat Brutus used to eat green figs and honey.[345]\r\n\r\nHemina wrote Roman annals in five or six books, and published them about\r\nthe time of the fall of Carthage:[346] a considerable number of\r\nfragments are extant. He was the last writer of this period who\r\ninvestigated the original sources of history. His researches went back\r\nto very early times; and he appears to have attempted, at least, a\r\ncomparison of Greek and Italian chronology, for he fixes the age of\r\nHomer and Hesiod in the dynasty of the Silvii, more than 160 years after\r\nthe siege of Troy. He relates the original legend of Cacus and the oxen\r\nof Hercules, the finding of Numa’s coffin, and the celebration of the\r\nfourth sæcular games in the consulship of Lentulus and Mummius.[347]\r\nThis was probably the last event of importance previous to the\r\npublication of his work. Only two fragments are of sufficient length to\r\nenable us to form any judgment respecting his style. Many of his\r\nexpressions are very archaic, but the story of Cacus is told in a simple\r\nand pleasing manner.\r\n\r\nAfter Hemina, Roman history was, for some years, nothing more than a\r\ncompilation from the old chronicles, and from the labours and\r\ninvestigations of previous authors. Q. Fabius Maximus Servilianus was\r\nconsul A. U. C. 612. His Latin style must have been very deficient in\r\neuphony, if he frequently indulged in such words as _litterosissimum_,\r\nwhich occurs in one of the fragments extant. C. Fannius, prætor A. U. C.\r\n617, wrote a meager history[348] in not inelegant Latin. Vennonius, his\r\ncontemporary, was the author of annals which are referred to by\r\nDionysius. To this list of historians may be added C. Sempronius\r\nTuditanus, a polished gentleman as well as an elegant writer.[349]\r\n\r\nThe days of the Gracchi were very fruitful in historians and\r\nautobiographers. At the head of them stands L. Cælius Antipater,[350] a\r\nRoman freedman, an eloquent orator, and skilful jurist. His work\r\nconsisted of seven books, and many fragments are preserved by the\r\ngrammarians. He seems to have delighted in the marvellous; for Cicero\r\nquotes from two remarkable dreams in his treatise on divination. He is\r\nalso frequently referred to by Livy in his history of the Punic wars.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with Cælius lived Cn. Gellius, whose voluminous\r\nhistory extended to the length of ninety-seven books at least. Livy\r\nseldom refers to him. Probably, in this instance, he acted wisely; for\r\nhe seems to have been an historian of little or no authority. Two other\r\nGellii, Sextus and Aulus, flourished at the same time.\r\n\r\nPublius Sempronius Asellio wrote, about the middle of the seventh\r\ncentury of Rome, a memoir of the Numantian war. He was an eye-witness of\r\nthe scenes which he describes, for he was tribune at Numantia under\r\nScipio Africanus.[351]\r\n\r\nThe only constitutional history of Rome was the work of C. Junius, who\r\nwas surnamed Gracchanus, in consequence of his intimacy with C.\r\nGracchus. It is certain that this work must have been the result of\r\noriginal research, as there are no remains extant of any history which\r\ncould have furnished the materials. The legal and political knowledge\r\nwhich it contained was evidently considerable, for it is quoted by the\r\njurists as a trustworthy authority.[352]\r\n\r\nServius Fabius Pictor[353] wrote annals; but his principal work was a\r\ntreatise on the pontifical law, an antiquarian record of rites and\r\nceremonies. L. Calpurnius Piso Frugi Censorius was consul in the year in\r\nwhich Ti. Sempronius Gracchus was killed, and censor the year after the\r\nmurder of C. Gracchus:[354] he is occasionally quoted by Dionysius, and\r\ntwice by Livy, who, on the points in question, consider his authority\r\nless trustworthy than that of Fabius Pictor.[355] Gellius[356] quotes\r\nfrom him the following traditional anecdote of Romulus. Once upon a time\r\nthe king was invited out to supper. He drank very little, because he had\r\nbusiness to transact on the following day. Some one at table remarked,\r\nif every body did so, wine would be cheaper. “Nay,” replied Romulus, “I\r\nhave drank as much as I wished; if every body did so, it would be dear.”\r\n\r\nPiso was an honest man, but not an honest historian. He acquired the\r\nsurname Frugi by his strict integrity and simple habits; but his\r\ningenuity tempted him to disregard historical truth. Niebuhr considers\r\nhim the first who introduced systematic forgeries into Roman history.\r\nSeeing the discrepancies and consistencies between the accounts given by\r\nprevious annalists, instead of weighing them together, and adopting\r\nthose which were best supported by the testimony of antiquity, he either\r\ninvented theories, in order to reconcile conflicting statements, or\r\nsubstituted some narrative which he thought might have been the\r\ngroundwork of the marvellous legend. Niebuhr observes, that he treated\r\nhistory precisely in the same way in which the rationalists endeavoured\r\nto divest the scripture of its miraculous character.\r\n\r\nM. Æmilius Scaurus, P. Rutilius Rufus, and Q. Lutatius Catulus, were the\r\nfirst Roman autobiographers; and their example was afterwards followed\r\nby Sulla, who employed his retirement in writing his own memoir in\r\ntwenty-two books. Scaurus was the son of a charcoal-dealer, who, by his\r\nmilitary talents, twice raised himself to the consulship, and once\r\nenjoyed the honour of a triumph. A few unimportant fragments of his\r\npersonal memoirs are preserved by the grammarians. Rutilius was consul\r\nA. U. C. 649: he wrote his own life in Latin, and a history of Rome in\r\nGreek.[357] Catulus is praised by Cicero for his Latinity, who compares\r\nhis style to that of Xenophon.[358]\r\n\r\nThe other historians, who flourished immediately before the literary\r\nperiod of Cicero, were C. Licinius Macer, Q. Claudius Quadrigarius, and\r\nQ. Valerius Antias.\r\n\r\nMacer[359] was a prolix and gossiping writer: he was not deficient in\r\nindustry; he spared no pains in collecting traditions; but he had no\r\njudgment in selection, and accepted all the Greek fables respecting\r\nItaly without discrimination. Hence he makes some statements which were\r\nrejected by annalists of greater authority. Niebuhr[360] defends him,\r\nand regrets deeply the loss of his annals. He thinks it not improbable\r\nthat Cicero’s unfavourable criticism may have been owing to political\r\nprejudice. His work was voluminous, and probably traced the Roman\r\nhistory from the commencement to his own times.\r\n\r\nQuadrigarius is much quoted both by Livy and the grammarians. From the\r\nfragments extant it is clear that his history commenced with the Gallic\r\nwars; and from a passage in Plutarch’s Life of Numa,[361] he appears to\r\nhave been actuated by a motive indicative of his truthfulness as an\r\nhistorian. He was not content with fabulous legends; and there were no\r\ndocuments in existence anterior to the capture of Rome by the Gauls. His\r\nwork consisted of twenty-three books: it carried the history, as is\r\ngenerally supposed, as far as the death of Sulla,[362] or, as Niebuhr\r\nbelieved, down to the consulship of Cicero.[363] The longest fragment\r\nextant has been preserved by Gellius, and relates the combat of Manlius\r\nTorquatus with the gigantic Gaul.\r\n\r\nThe style is abrupt and sententious, and the structure of the sentences\r\nloose; but the story is told in a naïve and spirited manner. One can\r\nrealize the scene as the historian describes it—the awe of the Roman\r\nhost at the unwonted sight—the gigantic stature, the truculent\r\ncountenance of the Goliath-like youth—the unbroken silence, in the midst\r\nof which his voice of thunder uttered his defiance—the scorn with which\r\nhe sneered and put out his tongue when no one accepted his challenge—the\r\nshame and grief of the noble Manlius—the struggle—the cutting off the\r\nmonster’s head, and the wreathing his own neck with the collar still\r\nreeking with blood.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that this historian received the surname\r\nQuadrigarius because, in the games of the circus, celebrated after the\r\nvictory of Sulla, he won the prize in the chariot-race.\r\n\r\nNo Roman historian ever made greater pretensions to accuracy than\r\nValerius Antias, and no one was less trustworthy. Livy, on one\r\noccasion,[364] accuses him of either negligence or impudent\r\nexaggeration; but there is no doubt that he was guilty of the latter\r\nfault. Almost all the places in which he is quoted by Livy have\r\nreference to numbers, and in all he not only goes far beyond all other\r\nhistorians,[365] but even transgresses the bounds of possibility. Livy\r\nnever hesitates to call him a liar. In all cases he is guilty of\r\nfalsehood; the only question is whether his falsehood is more or less\r\nmoderate. The following examples are sufficient to convict him. He\r\nundertakes to assert that the exact number of the Sabine virgins was\r\n527.[366] If one historian states that 60 engines of war were taken, he\r\nmakes the number 6,000;[367] when all authors, Greek and Latin, unite in\r\nasserting that in A. U. C. 553, there was no memorable campaign, he says\r\na battle was fought in which 12,000 of the enemy were slain and 1,200\r\ntaken prisoners.[368] In another place 10,000 slain become 40,000;[369]\r\nand a fine which Quadrigarius states was to be paid by instalments in\r\nthirty years, he distributes only over the space of ten.[370] With\r\nmatter of this unauthentic kind, he filled no less than seventy-five\r\nbooks, of which a large portion of passages have been preserved,\r\nespecially by Livy.\r\n\r\nHitherto, with one doubtful exception, Latin historical composition was\r\nin the hands of the great and noble; the first historian belonging to\r\nthe order of the libertinei was L. Otacilius Pilitus. Suetonius[371]\r\nsays, that he was not only originally a slave, but that he acted as\r\nporter, and, as was the custom, was chained to his master’s door.\r\nNothing is known of his works; it is probable, therefore, that they were\r\nof no merit.\r\n\r\nTwo more important names remain to be mentioned amongst the annalists of\r\nthis period—L. Cornelius Sisenna and Q. Ælius Tubero. Sisenna, according\r\nto the testimony of Cicero,[372] was born between B. C. 640 and B. C.\r\n680, and filled the office of quæstor B. C. 676. He was, according to\r\nthe same authority, a man of learning and taste, wrote pure Latin, was\r\nwell acquainted with public business, and, although deficient in\r\nindustry, surpassed all his predecessors and contemporaries in his\r\ntalents as an historian. Probably his style of writing approached more\r\nnearly to that of the new school, although still below the Ciceronian\r\nstandard. The testimony of Sallust is not so favourable, as he considers\r\nhim not sufficiently impartial to fulfil adequately the duties of a\r\ncontemporary historian.[373]\r\n\r\nNo fragments are extant of sufficient length to enable us to form any\r\nestimate of his merits, although, on account of the numerous unusual\r\nwords which occur in his writings, no historian of this period has been\r\nmore frequently quoted by the grammarians. The probability is that his\r\ntwenty-three books are of little or no value, as they are never referred\r\nto in order to illustrate matters of historical or antiquarian interest.\r\n\r\nTubero was the contemporary of Cicero, and did not write his annals\r\nuntil after Cicero’s consulship. Nevertheless he must be considered as\r\nbelonging to the old school, and its last as well as one of its most\r\nworthy representatives. He was the father of L. Tubero, the legate of Q.\r\nCicero, in Asia. Like Piso, he was a stout opponent of the Gracchic\r\npolicy, and a firm supporter of the aristocracy. A stoic in philosophy,\r\nhis life was in strict accordance with his creed, and his style of\r\nwriting is said to have been marked with Catonian rudeness. He\r\ndescribes, in his history, the cruel tortures of Regulus by the\r\nCarthaginians, and relates the story of the wonderful serpent at\r\nBagrada.[374] He is once quoted by Dionysius and twice by Livy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n     EARLY ROMAN ORATORY—ELOQUENCE OF APPIUS CLAUDIUS CÆCUS—FUNERAL\r\n   ORATIONS—DEFENCE OF SCIPIO AFRICANUS MAJOR—SCIPIO AFRICANUS MINOR\r\n   ÆMILIANUS—ERA OF THE GRACCHI—THEIR CHARACTERS—INTERVAL BETWEEN THE\r\nGRACCHI AND CICERO—M. ANTONIUS—L. LICINIUS CRASSUS—Q. HORTENSIUS—CAUSES\r\n            OF HIS EARLY POPULARITY AND SUBSEQUENT FAILURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEloquence, though of a rude, unpolished kind, must have been in the very\r\nearliest times a characteristic of the Roman people. It is a plant\r\nindigenous to a free soil. Its infancy was nurtured in the schools of\r\nTisias and Corax, when, on the dethronement of the tyrants, the dawn of\r\nfreedom brightened upon Sicily; and, just as in modern times it has\r\nflourished, especially in England and America, fostered by the\r\nunfettered freedom of debate, so it found a congenial home in free\r\nGreece and republican Rome. He who could contrast in the most glowing\r\ncolours the cruelty of the pitiless creditor, with the sufferings of the\r\nruined debtor—who could ingeniously connect those patent evils with some\r\ndefects in the constitution, some inequalities in political rights\r\nhitherto hidden and unobserved—would wield at will the affections of the\r\npeople, and become the master-spirit amongst his fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nOccasions would not be wanting in a state where, from the earliest\r\ntimes, a struggle was continually maintained between a dominant and a\r\nsubject race, for the use of those arts of eloquence which nature, the\r\nmistress of all art, suggests. The plebeians, in their conflicts with\r\nthe patricians, must have had some leader, and eloquence, probably to a\r\ngreat extent, directed the selection, even though there was, in reality,\r\nno Menenius Agrippa to lead them back from the sacred mountain with his\r\nhomely wisdom. Cases of oppression, doubtless, inspired some Icilius or\r\nVirginius with words of burning indignation, and many a Siccius\r\nDentatus, though he had never learnt technical rhetoric, used the\r\nrhetorical artifice of appealing to his honourable wounds and scars in\r\nfront, which he had received in the service of his country, and to\r\ndisgraceful weals with which his back was lacerated by the lash of the\r\ntorturer. In an army where the personal influence of the general was\r\nmore productive of heroism than the rules of a long-established\r\ndiscipline, a short harangue often led the soldiers to victory. And,\r\nlastly, the relation subsisting between the two orders of patron and\r\nclient taught a milder and more business-like eloquence—that of\r\nexplaining with facility common civil rights, and unravelling the knotty\r\npoints of the constitutional law. Oratory, in fact, was the unwritten\r\nliterature of active life, and recommended itself by its antagonistic\r\nspirit and its utility to a warlike and utilitarian people. Long,\r\ntherefore, before the art of the historian was sufficiently advanced to\r\nrecord a speech, or to insert a fictitious one, as an embellishment or\r\nillustration of its pages, the forum, senate, the battle-field, the\r\nthreshold of the jurisconsult, had been nurseries of Roman eloquence, or\r\nschools in which oratory attained a vigorous youth, and prepared for its\r\nsubsequent maturity.\r\n\r\nTradition speaks of a speech recorded even before the poetry of Nævius\r\nwas written, and this speech was known to Cicero. It was delivered\r\nagainst Pyrrhus by Appius Claudius the blind.[375] He belonged to a\r\nhouse, every member of which, from the decemvir to the emperor, was born\r\nto bow down their fellow-men beneath their strong wills. Such a\r\ncharacter, united with a poetical genius, implies the very elements of\r\nthat oratory which would curb a nation accustomed to be restrained by\r\nforce as much as by reason. On this celebrated occasion,[376] the blind\r\nold man caused himself to be borne into the senate-house on a litter,\r\nthat he might confront the wily Cineas whom Pyrrhus had sent to\r\nnegotiate peace. The Macedonian minister was an accomplished speaker,\r\nand his memory, that important auxiliary to eloquence, was so powerful,\r\nthat in one day he learnt to address all the senators and knights by\r\nname, yet it is said that he was no match for the energy of Appius, and\r\nwas obliged to quit Rome.\r\n\r\nWhilst the legal and political constitution of the Roman people gave\r\ndirect encouragement to deliberative and judicial oratory, respect to\r\nthe illustrious dead furnished opportunities for panegyric. The song of\r\nthe bard in honour of the departed warrior gave place to the funeral\r\noration, (_laudatio_.)\r\n\r\nBefore the commencement of the second Punic war,[377] Q. Metellus\r\npronounced the funeral harangue over his father, the conqueror of\r\nHasdrubal; history also speaks of him as a debator in the senate, and\r\nhis address to the censors is found in the fourth decade of Livy.[378]\r\nThis funeral oration was admired even in the time of J. Cæsar, and\r\nPliny[379] has recorded the substance of one remarkable passage which it\r\ncontained. The period of the second Punic war produced Corn. Cethegus.\r\nCicero mentions him in his list of Roman orators;[380] and although he\r\nhad never seen a specimen of his style, he states that he retained his\r\nforce and vigour even in his old age. Ennius also bears testimony to his\r\neloquence in the following line:—\r\n\r\n               Flos delibatus populi, suaviloquenti ore.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the second war, Fabius Cunctator pronounced the\r\neulogium[381] of his elder son; and Cicero, although he denies him the\r\npraise of eloquence, states that he was a fluent and correct speaker.\r\n\r\nScipio Africanus Major, on that memorable day when his enemies called\r\nupon him to render an account of the moneys received from Antiochus,\r\nproved himself a consummate orator: he disdained to refute the malignant\r\ncharges of his opponents, but spoke till dusk of the benefits which he\r\nhad conferred upon his country. Thus it came to pass that the adjourned\r\nmeeting was held on the anniversary of Zama. Livy has adorned the simple\r\nwords of the great soldier with his graceful language, but A.\r\nGellius[382] has preserved the peroration almost in his own words. “I\r\ncall to remembrance, Romans,” said he, “that this is the very day on\r\nwhich I vanquished in a bloody battle on the plains of Africa the\r\nCarthaginian Hannibal, the most formidable enemy Rome ever encountered.\r\nI obtained for you a peace and an unlooked-for victory. Let us then not\r\nbe ungrateful to heaven, but let us leave this knave, and at once offer\r\nour grateful thanksgivings to Jove, supremely good and great.”\r\n\r\nThe people obeyed his summons—the forum was deserted, and crowds\r\nfollowed him with acclamations to the Capitol.\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of the stern eloquence of his adversary\r\nCato. He was equally laborious as a speaker and a writer. No fewer than\r\none hundred and fifty of his orations were extant in Cicero’s time, most\r\nof which were on subjects of public and political interest.\r\n\r\nThe father of the Gracchi was distinguished amongst his contemporaries\r\nfor a plain and nervous eloquence, but no specimens of his oratory have\r\nsurvived.\r\n\r\nScipio Africanus Minor (Æmilianus) was precisely qualified to be the\r\nlink between the new and the old school of oratory. His soldier-like\r\ncharacter displayed all the vigour and somewhat of the sternness of the\r\nold Roman, but the harder outlines were modified by an ardent love of\r\nlearning. His first campaign was in Greece, under his father Æmilius\r\nPaulus. His first literary friendship was formed there with the\r\nhistorian Polybius, which ripened into the closest intimacy when\r\nPolybius came as a hostage to Rome. Subsequently he became acquainted\r\nwith Panætius, who was his instructor in the principles of philosophy.\r\nHis taste was gratified with Greek refinement, although he abhorred the\r\neffeminacy and profligacy of the Greeks themselves. In the spirit of\r\nCato, for whom he entertained the warmest admiration, he indignantly\r\nremonstrated against the inroad of Greek manners. In his speech in\r\nopposition to the law of C. Gracchus, he warned his hearers of the\r\ncorruptions which were already insinuating themselves amongst the Roman\r\nyouth. “I did not believe what I heard,” he says, “until I witnessed it\r\nwith my own eyes: at the dancing-school I saw more than five hundred of\r\nthe youth of both sexes. I saw a boy, of at least twelve years old,\r\nwearing the badge of noble birth, who performed a castanet dance, which\r\nan immodest slave could not have danced without disgrace.”\r\n\r\nThe degeneracy of Greek manners had not corrupted his moral nature, or\r\nrendered him averse to the active duties of a citizen; it had not\r\ndestroyed the frankness, whilst it had humanized the rough honesty, of\r\nthe Roman, and taught him to love the beautiful as well as the good, and\r\nto believe that the former was the proper external development of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nOne friend, whose influence contributed to form the mind of Scipio, was\r\nthe wise and gentle Lælius. In other places, as well as in the “_de\r\nAmicitia_,” Cicero associates their names together. These distinguished\r\nfriends were well suited to each other. The sentiments of both were\r\nnoble and elevated. “Both,” as Cicero[383] says, “were ‘_imprimis\r\neloquentes_.’” Their discrepancies were such as draw men of similar\r\ntastes more closely together, in those hours which they can devote to\r\ntheir favourite pursuits. Scipio was an active man of business—Lælius, a\r\ncontemplative philosopher: Scipio, a Roman in heart and soul—Lælius, a\r\ncitizen of the world: Scipio was rather inclined to ostentatious\r\ndisplay—Lælius was retiring. The former had a correct taste, spoke Latin\r\nwith great purity, and had an extensive acquaintance with the literature\r\nboth of Greece and his own country. The attainments of the latter were\r\nmore solid, and his acquaintance with the mind of Greece more profound.\r\nBut Lælius was not equally calculated to occupy a place in history; and\r\nhence, perhaps, although a few fragments of the eloquence of Scipio are\r\nextant,[384] the remains of that of Lælius extend only to as many lines.\r\nCheerfulness, (hilaritas,) smoothness, (lenitas,) and learning\r\ndistinguished the speeches of Lælius, whilst spirit, genius, and natural\r\npower marked those of Scipio.\r\n\r\nServius Sulpicius Galba, whom Cato[385] prosecuted for his treachery to\r\nthe Lusitanians, obtained from Cicero the praise of having been the\r\nfirst Roman who really understood how to apply the theoretical\r\nprinciples of Greek rhetoric. He is said likewise to have carried away\r\nwith him the feelings of his auditors by his animated and vehement\r\ndelivery. How skilful he was in the use of rhetorical artifice is shown\r\nby his parading before the assembly of the people, when brought to\r\ntrial, his two infant sons, and the orphan of his friend Sulpicius\r\nGallus. His tears and embraces touched the hearts of his judges, and the\r\ncold-blooded perjurer was acquitted. External artifice, however,\r\nprobably constituted his whole merit. He had the tact thus to cover a\r\ndry and antique style, destitute of nerve and muscle, of which no\r\nspecimen except only a few words remain.\r\n\r\nAll periods of political disquiet are necessarily favourable to\r\neloquence, and the era of the Gracchi was especially so. Extensive\r\npolitical changes were now established. They had been of slow and\r\ngradual growth, and were the natural development of the Roman system;\r\nbut they were changes which could not take place without the crisis\r\nbeing accompanied by great political convulsions. In order to understand\r\nthe state of parties, of which the great leaders and principal orators\r\nwere the representatives, it is necessary to explain briefly in what\r\nthese changes consisted. The result of an obstinate and persevering\r\nstruggle during nearly four centuries was, that the old distinction of\r\npatrician and plebeian no longer existed. Plebeians held the\r\nconsulship[386] and censorship,[387] and patricians, like the Gracchi,\r\nstood forward as plebeian tribunes and champions of popular rights.\r\n\r\nThe distinctions of blood and race, therefore, were no longer regarded.\r\nMost of the old patrician families were extinct. Niebuhr believes that\r\nat this period not more than fifteen patrician “_gentes_” remained; and\r\nthe individual members of those which survived, if they maintained their\r\nposition at all, maintained it by personal influence. The constitutional\r\nprinciple which determined the difference of ranks was property. This\r\nline of demarkation between rich and poor was not an impassable one like\r\nthat of birth, but it had now become very broad and deep, owing to the\r\naccumulation of wealth in few hands; and thus between these two orders\r\nthere was as little sympathy as there had been between the patrician\r\ncreditors and the plebeian debtors in the earlier times of the republic.\r\n\r\nBut besides this constitutional principle of distinction, there was\r\nanother of a more aristocratic nature, which owed its erection to public\r\nopinion. Those families the members of which had held high public\r\noffices were termed _nobiles_ (nobles.) Those individuals whose families\r\nhad never been so distinguished were termed new men (_novi homines_.)\r\nThus a man’s ancestors were made hostages for his patriotism; and so\r\ntrustworthy a pledge was hereditary merit considered for ability and\r\nfidelity in the discharge of high functions, that only in a few\r\nexceptional cases was the consulship, although open to all, conferred\r\nupon a new man. One consequence of all these changes was, that the\r\nstruggle for political distinction became hotter than ever, and the\r\nstrife more vehement between the competitors for public favour.\r\n\r\nThese stirring times produced many celebrated orators. Papirius Carbo,\r\nthe ultra-liberal and unscrupulous colleague of Tiberius Gracchus, who\r\nunited the gift of a beautiful voice to copiousness and fluency; Lepidus\r\nPorcina, who attained the perfection of Attic gentleness, and whom Tib.\r\nGracchus took as his model; Æmilius Scaurus, whom Statius libelled as of\r\nignoble birth; Rutilius Rufus, who was too upright to appeal to the\r\ncompassion of his judges;[388] M. Junius Pennus, who met by an insulting\r\nalien act the bill of Gracchus for the enfranchisement of the Italians.\r\n\r\nThe Gracchi themselves were each in a different degree eloquent, and\r\npossessed those endowments and accidents of birth which would recommend\r\ntheir eloquence to their countrymen. Gentleness and kindness were the\r\ncharacteristics of this illustrious race. Their father, by his mild\r\nadministration, attached to himself the warm affection of the Spaniards.\r\nTheir mother inherited the strong mind and genius of Scipio. To a sound\r\nknowledge of Greek and Latin literature[389] and a talent for poetry,\r\nshe added feminine accomplishments. She danced elegantly, more\r\nelegantly, indeed, than according to the strict notions of Roman\r\nmorality a woman of character need have done. She could also sing and\r\naccompany herself upon the lute. To her care in early youth the\r\nillustrious brothers owed the development of their natural endowments,\r\nand the direction of their generous principles. Cicero tells us that he\r\nhad seen the letters of this remarkable woman, which showed how much her\r\nsons were indebted to her teaching. Greek philosophers aided her in her\r\nwork; and the accomplished Lælius contributed to add grace and polish to\r\nthe more solid portions of her education.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that the political principles which the Gracchi embraced\r\nwere the same, their characters, or, more properly speaking, their\r\ntemperaments, widely differed, and their style of speaking was, as might\r\nbe expected, in accordance with their respective dispositions. Tiberius\r\nwas cold, deliberate, sedate, reserved. The storms of passion never\r\nruffled the calmness of his feelings. His speaking, therefore, was\r\nself-possessed and grave, as stoical as his philosophical creed. His\r\nconduct was not the result of impulse, but of a strict sense of duty.\r\nCicero termed him _homo sanctissimus_, and his style was as chastened as\r\nhis integrity was spotless. Such, if we may trust Plutarch, was the\r\ncharacter of his oratory, for no fragments remain.\r\n\r\nCaius, who was nine years younger than his brother, was warm,\r\npassionate, and impetuous: he was inferior to Tiberius morally, as he\r\nwas intellectually his superior. His impulses were generous and amiable,\r\nbut he had not that unswerving rectitude of purpose which is the result\r\nof moral principle. He had, however, more genius, more creative power.\r\nHis imagination, lashed by the violence of his passions, required a\r\nstrong curb; but for that reason it gushed forth as from a natural\r\nfountain, and like a torrent carried all before it. On one occasion, to\r\nwhich Cicero alludes,[390] his look, his voice, his gestures, were so\r\ninexpressibly affecting, that even his enemies were dissolved in tears.\r\nIt is said that in his calmer moments he was conscious that his\r\nvehemence was apt to offend against good taste, and employed a slave to\r\nstand near him with a pitch-pipe, in order that he might regulate his\r\nvoice when passion rendered the tones unmusical. His education enabled\r\nhim to rid himself of the harshness of the old school, and to gain the\r\nreputation of being the father of Roman prose. But his impetuosity made\r\nhim leave unfinished that which he had well begun. “His language was\r\nnoble, his sentiments wise; gravity pervaded his whole style, but his\r\nworks wanted the last finishing stroke. There were many glorious\r\nbeginnings, but they were not brought to perfection.”[391] Several\r\nfragments remain, which confirm the correctness of Cicero’s\r\ncriticism—one of the most beautiful is from his speech against Popilius\r\nLænas, which drove that blood-thirsty tyrant into voluntary exile.\r\n\r\nOratory began now to be studied more as an art, and to be invested with\r\na more polished garb. The interval between the Gracchi and Cicero\r\nboasted of many distinguished names, such as those of Q. Catulus, Curio,\r\nFimbria, Scævola, Cotta, P. Sulpicius, and the Memmii. The most\r\nillustrious names of this epoch were M. Antonius, L. Licinius Crassus,\r\nand Cicero’s immediate predecessor and most formidable rival,\r\nHortensius. Antony and Crassus, says Cicero, were the first Romans who\r\nelevated eloquence to the heights to which it had been raised by Greek\r\ngenius.[392] From this complaint it may be inferred that,\r\nnotwithstanding the popular prejudice which existed against Greek taste,\r\nand to which even Cicero himself sometimes conceived himself obliged to\r\nyield,[393] the leading orators had ceased to take the specimens of old\r\nRoman eloquence as their models. Cicero asserts[394] that both Antony\r\nand Crassus owed their eminence to a diligent study of Greek literature,\r\nand to the instructions of Greek professors. The former, he says,\r\nattended regularly lectures at Athens and Rhodes, and the latter spoke\r\nGreek as if it had been his mother tongue. Yet both had the\r\nnarrow-minded vanity to deny their obligations: they thought their\r\neloquence would be more popular, the one by showing contempt for the\r\nGreeks, the other by affecting not to know them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              M. ANTONIUS.\r\n\r\nM. Antonius entered public life as a pleader, and thus laid the\r\nfoundation of his brilliant political career; but he was through life\r\ngreater as a judicial than as a deliberative orator. He was\r\nindefatigable in preparing his case, and made every point tell: he was a\r\ngreat master of the pathetic, and knew the way to the hearts of the\r\n_judices_. He was not free from the prevailing fault of advocates, of\r\nbeing somewhat unscrupulous in his assertions; and the reason which he\r\nis said to have given for never having published any of his speeches\r\nwas, lest he should be forced to deny his words. This statement,\r\nhowever, is refuted by Cicero.[395] Although he did not himself give his\r\nspeeches to posterity, some of his most pointed expressions and\r\nfavourite passages left an indelible impression on the memories of his\r\nhearers: many are preserved by Cicero, who has given us also a complete\r\nepitome of one of them.[396] In the prime of life, he fell a victim to\r\npolitical fury; and his bleeding head was placed upon the rostrum which\r\nwas so frequently the scene of his eloquent triumphs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          L. LICINIUS CRASSUS.\r\n\r\nL. Licinius Crassus was four years younger than Antonius, having been\r\nborn B. C. 140. It is not known whether he was connected with the\r\ndistinguished family whose name he bore. He commenced his career at the\r\nRoman bar.[397] At the early age of twenty-one, he successfully\r\nimpeached C. Carbo, and in the year B. C. 118 supported the foundation\r\nof a colony at Narbo, in Gaul. A measure so beneficial to the poorer\r\ncitizens increased his popularity as well as his professional fame. He\r\nwent to Asia as quæstor, and there studied under Metrodorus the\r\nrhetorician. On his way home he remained a short time at Athens, and\r\nattended the lectures of the leading professors.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his knowledge of jurisprudence, and his early eminence\r\nas a pleader, the speech which established his reputation was a\r\npolitical one. Under the Roman judicial system, the prætor presided in\r\ncourt, with a certain number of assessors, (judices,) who gave their\r\nverdict like our jurymen. These were chosen from the senators.\r\nExperience proved that not only in their determination to stand by their\r\norder they were guilty of partiality, but that they had also been open\r\nto bribery. The knights constituted the nearest approach which could be\r\nfound to a rich middle class. C. Gracchus, therefore, by the “Lex\r\nSempronia,” transferred the administration of justice to a body of three\r\nhundred men, chosen from the equestrian order. This promised to be a\r\nsalutary change; but so corrupt was the whole framework of Roman\r\nsociety, that it did not prove effectual. The _Publicani_, who farmed\r\nthe revenues of the provinces, were all Roman knights. The new judges,\r\ntherefore, were as anxious to shield the peculations and extortions of\r\ntheir own brethren as the old had been.\r\n\r\nIn B. C. 106, L. Servilius Cæpio brought in a bill for the restoration\r\nof the judicial office to the senators. In support of this measure (the\r\nfirst Lex Servilia,) Crassus delivered a powerful and triumphant\r\noration, in which he warmly espoused the cause of the senate, whom he\r\nhad before as strenuously opposed on the question of the colony to\r\nNarbo. This speech was his _chef-d’œuvre_.[398] After serving the office\r\nof consul,[399] in which he seems to have mistaken his vocation by\r\nexchanging the toga for the sword, he was raised to the censorship.[400]\r\nHis year of office is celebrated for the closing the schools of the\r\nLatin rhetoricians by an edict of himself and his colleague. The\r\nfoundations of these schools had been laid in the ruins of the Greek\r\nschools, when the philosophers and rhetoricians were banished from\r\nRome.[401] Although the censorial power could suppress the schools, it\r\ncould not put a stop to the education given there. The professors found\r\na refuge in private mansions; and thus, protected and fostered by\r\nintelligent patrons, continued to fulfil their duties as instructors of\r\nyouth. How often did literature at Rome have to seek an asylum from\r\nprivate patronage against the rude attacks of public prejudice! The\r\nreasons for the measure of Crassus are stated in the preamble.[402]\r\nThese schools were a novelty; they were contrary to ancient\r\ninstitutions; they encouraged idle habits among the Roman youth. Cicero\r\ndefended this arbitrary act on the ground that the professors pretended\r\nto teach subjects of which they were themselves ignorant; but Cicero\r\ncould scarcely find a fault in Crassus. He thought him a model of\r\nperfection—the first of orators and jurists.[403] He saw no\r\ninconsistency in his conduct in the cases of the Narbonne colony and the\r\nServilian law.[404] He is lavish in his praises of his wit and\r\nfacetiousness, (lepor et facetiæ,[405]) and applies to his malignant and\r\nill-natured jokes the term urbanity. The bon-mots of Crassus were by no\r\nmeans superior to the generality of Roman witticisms, which were\r\ndeficient in point, although they were personal, caustic, and\r\nsevere.[406] The grave Romans were content with a very little wit; the\r\nquality for which they looked in an oration was not playfulness, but\r\nskill in the art of ingenious tormenting. Crassus never uttered a jest\r\nequal to that of old Cato, when he said of Q. Helvidius, the glutton,\r\nwhose house was on fire, “What he could not eat he has burned.”[407]\r\n\r\nHis conduct with respect to the Latin schools, and his self-indulgent\r\nlife in his magnificent mansion on the Palatine, prove that he had\r\nretained the narrow-mindedness of the old Romans without their\r\ntemperance and self-denial, and had acquired the luxury and taste of the\r\nGreeks without their liberality. If, however, we make some allowance for\r\npartiality, Crassus deserves the favourable criticism of Cicero.[408]\r\nHis style is careful and yet not laboured—it is elegant, accurate, and\r\nperspicuous. He seems to have possessed considerable powers of\r\nillustration, and great clearness in explaining and defining; his\r\ndelivery was calm and self-possessed, his action sufficiently vehement,\r\nbut not excessive.[409] He took especial pains with the commencement of\r\nhis speech. When he was about to speak, every one was prepared to\r\nlisten, and the very first words which he uttered showed him worthy of\r\nthe expectation formed. No one better understood the difficult art of\r\nuniting elegance with brevity.\r\n\r\nFrom amongst the crowd of orators which were then flourishing in the\r\nlast days of expiring Roman liberty, Cicero selected Crassus to be the\r\nrepresentative of his sentiments in his imaginary conversation in the\r\n_de Oratore_. He felt that their tastes were congenial. In this most\r\ncaptivating essay, he introduces his readers to a distinguished literary\r\ncircle, men who united activity in public life with a taste for refined\r\nleisure. Antony, Crassus, Scævola, Cotta, and Sulpicius, met at Tusculum\r\nto talk of the politics of the day. For this especial purpose they had\r\ncome, and all day long they ceased not to converse on these grave\r\nmatters. They spoke not of lighter matters until they reclined at\r\nsupper. Their day seemed to have been spent in the senate, their evening\r\nat Tusculum. Next day, in the serene and sunny climate of Frascati, a\r\nscene well fitted for the calm repose of a Platonic dialogue, Scævola\r\nproposed to imitate the Socrates of Plato, and converse, as the great\r\nphilosopher did, beneath the shade of a plane-tree. Crassus assented,\r\nsuggesting only that cushions would be more convenient than the grass.\r\nSo the dialogue began in which Crassus is made the mouthpiece to deliver\r\nthe sentiments of Cicero.\r\n\r\nLike our own Chatham, Crassus almost died on the floor of the\r\nsenate-house, and his last effort was in support of the aristocratic\r\nparty. His opponent, Philippus the consul, strained his power to the\r\nutmost to insult him, and ordered his goods to be seized. His last words\r\nwere worthy of him. He mourned the bereavement of the senate—that the\r\nconsul, like a sacrilegious robber, should strip of its patrimony the\r\nvery order of which he ought to have been a kind parent or faithful\r\nguardian. “It is useless,” he continued, “to seize these: if you will\r\nsilence Crassus, you must tear out his tongue, and even then my liberty\r\nshall breathe forth a refutation of thy licentiousness!” The paroxysm\r\nwas too much for him; fever ensued, and in seven days he was a corpse.\r\n\r\nWe must pass over numerous names contained in the catalogue of Cicero,\r\nmentioning by the way Cotta and the two Sulpicii. Cotta’s taste was\r\npure; but his delicate lungs made his oratory too tame for his vehement\r\ncountrymen. Publius Sulpicius had all the powers of a tragic actor to\r\ninfluence the passions, but professed that he could not write, and\r\ntherefore left no specimens behind him. His reluctance to write must\r\nhave been the result of reserve or of indolence, and not of inability,\r\nfor nothing can be more tender and touching, and yet more philosophical,\r\nthan his letter to Cicero on the death of his beloved daughter.[410]\r\nServius, like too many orators, and even Cicero himself, at first\r\ndespised an accurate knowledge of the Roman law. The great Scævola,\r\nhowever, rebuked him, and reminded him how disgraceful it was for one\r\nwho desired the reputation of an advocate to be ignorant of law. These\r\nwords excited his emulation; he ardently devoted himself to the study of\r\njurisprudence,[411] and at length is said to have surpassed even Scævola\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Q. HORTENSIUS.\r\n\r\nThe last of the pre-Ciceronian orators was Hortensius. Although he was\r\nscarcely eight years senior to the greatest of all Roman orators, he\r\ncannot be considered as belonging to the same literary period, since the\r\ngenius and eloquence of Cicero constitute the commencement of a new era.\r\nHe was, nevertheless, his contemporary and his rival; and all that is\r\nknown respecting his career is derived from the writings of Cicero.\r\n\r\nQ. Hortensius was the son of L. Hortensius, prætor of Sicily, B. C. 97.\r\nHe was born B. C. 114; and, as it was the custom that noble Roman youths\r\nshould be called to the bar at an early age, he commenced his career as\r\na pleader at nineteen, and pleaded, with applause and success, before\r\ntwo consuls who were excellent judges of his merits, the orator Crassus\r\nand the jurist Scævola. His first speech was in support of the province\r\nof Africa against the extortions of the governor. In his second he\r\ndefended Nicomedes, king of Bithynia, against his brother, who had\r\ndethroned him. When Crassus and Antony were dead, he was left without\r\nany rival except Cotta, but he soon surpassed him.[412] The eloquence of\r\nCotta was too languid to stand against the impetuous flow, and he thus\r\nbecame the acknowledged leader of the Roman bar until the star of Cicero\r\narose. They first came in contact when Cicero pleaded the cause of\r\nQuintius, and in that oration he pays the highest possible compliment to\r\nthe talents and genius of Hortensius.\r\n\r\nHis political connexion with the faction of Sulla, and his unscrupulous\r\nsupport of the profligate corruption which characterized that\r\nadministration both at home and abroad, enlisted his legal talents in\r\ndefence of the infamous Verres; but the eloquence of Cicero, together\r\nwith the justice of the cause which he espoused, prevailed, and from\r\nthat time forward his superiority over Hortensius was established and\r\ncomplete. But the admiration which Cicero entertained for his rival had\r\nripened into friendship, which neither the fact of their being retained\r\non opposite sides, nor even difference in politics, had power to\r\ninterrupt. The only danger which ever threatened its stability was some\r\nlittle jealousy on the part of Cicero—a jealousy which must be\r\nattributed to his morbid temperament and susceptible disposition. But\r\nHortensius was always a warm and affectionate friend to Cicero, and\r\nCicero was affected with the deepest grief when he heard of the death of\r\nHortensius.[413] The time at length arrived when identity of political\r\nsentiments drew them more closely together; and it is to this we owe the\r\nplace which Hortensius so often occupies in the letters and other works\r\nof the great Roman orator.\r\n\r\nCicero had originally espoused the popular cause; but his zeal gradually\r\nbecame less ardent, and the Catilinarian conspiracy threw him entirely\r\ninto the arms of the aristocratic party. At the Roman bar politics had\r\ngreat influence in determining the side taken by the leading advocates.\r\nThey were virtually the great law officers of the party in the republic\r\nto which they belonged, and had, as it were, general retainers on their\r\nown side. Hence Hortensius generally advocated the same side with\r\nCicero. Together they defended Rabirius, Muræna, Flaccus, Sextius,\r\nScaurus, and Milo; but the former seems to have at once acknowledged his\r\ninferiority, and henceforward to have taken but little part in public\r\nlife. In B. C. 51, he defended his nephew from a charge of bribery; but\r\nthe guilt of the accused was so plain that the people hissed him when he\r\nentered the theatre.[414] The following year he died, at the age of\r\nseventy-five, and left behind him a daughter, whose eloquence is\r\ncelebrated in history. An oration, of which she was the author, was read\r\nin the time of Quintilian for the sake of its own merits, and not as a\r\nmere compliment to the female sex. Q. Hortensius has been accused of\r\ncorruption; and his attachment to a corrupt party, his luxurious habits,\r\nextravagant expenditure, numerous villas, and enormous wealth, make it\r\nprobable that this suspicion was not unfounded. He was an easy,\r\nkind-hearted, hospitable, but self-indulgent man. His park was a\r\ncomplete menagerie; his fish-ponds were stocked with fish so tame that\r\nthey would feed from his hand. His gardens were so carefully kept that\r\nhe even watered his trees with wine. He had a taste for both poetry and\r\npainting, wrote some amatory verses, and for one picture gave 140,000\r\nsesterces, (about 1,100_l._) His table was sumptuous; and peacocks were\r\nseen for the first time in Rome at his banquets. His cellar was so well\r\nsupplied that he left 10,000 casks of Chian wine behind him.[415]\r\n\r\nCicero[416] tells us that the principal reason of Hortensius’ early\r\npopularity and subsequent failure was, that his style of eloquence was\r\nsuited to the brilliance and liveliness of youth, but not the dignity\r\nand gravity of mature age. In those days there were two parties,[417]\r\nwho differed in their views as to the theory of eloquence; the one\r\nadmired the oratory of the Attic rhetoricians, which was calm, polished,\r\nrefined, eschewing all redundancies; the other that of the Asiatic\r\nschools, which was florid and ornate.\r\n\r\nCicero[418] tells us that the style of Hortensius’ eloquence was\r\nAsiatic; and as the characteristic of his own eloquence is Asiatic\r\ndiffuseness rather than Attic closeness, and he often seems to consider\r\nthis quality of Asiatic eloquence least worthy of admiration, it is\r\npossible that Hortensius carried it to excess, perhaps even to the\r\nborders of affectation. In a youthful orator excess of ornament is\r\npardonable, because it is natural; it gives promise of future excellence\r\nwhen genius becomes sobered and luxuriance retrenched.\r\n\r\nHortensius, a prosperous and spoilt child of nature, was a young man all\r\nhis life: there was nothing to cast a gloom over his gayety; and to\r\nthose of his auditors who possessed good taste, this juvenility seemed\r\ninconsistent, and threw into the shade the finish, polish, and animation\r\nwhich characterized his style. His delivery was probably no less\r\nunsuitable to more advanced years. We are told that Æsop and Roscius\r\nused to study his action as a lesson;[419] and that one Torquatus\r\nsneeringly called him Dionysius, who was a celebrated dancer of that\r\nday. His defence was clever: “I had rather,” he said, “be that than a\r\nclumsy Torquatus.” But these very anecdotes seem to imply that his\r\ndelivery was somewhat foppish and theatrical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\nSTUDY OF JURISPRUDENCE—EARLIEST SYSTEMATIC WORKS ON ROMAN LAW—GROUNDWORK\r\n   OF THE ROMAN CIVIL LAW—EMINENT JURISTS—THE SCÆVOLÆ—ÆLIUS GALLUS—C.\r\n       AQUILIUS GALLUS, A LAW REFORMER—OTHER JURISTS—GRAMMARIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitics and jurisprudence were the subjects on which the Romans\r\nespecially pursued independent lines of thought; but their jurisprudence\r\nwas the more original of the two. Although the practical development of\r\ntheir political system was entirely the work of this eminently practical\r\npeople, still in the theory of political science they were followers and\r\nimitators of the Greeks. But in jurisprudence, the help which they\r\nderived from Greece was very slight. The mere framework, so far as the\r\nlaws of the Twelve Tables are concerned, came to them from Athens; but\r\nthe complete structure was built up by their own hands; and by their\r\nskill and prudence they were the authors of a system possessing such\r\nstability, that they bequeathed it as an inheritance to modern Europe,\r\nand traces of Roman law are visible in the legal systems of the whole\r\ncivilized world.\r\n\r\nRoman jurisprudence is, of course, a subject of too great extent to be\r\ntreated of as its importance deserves in a work like the present; but\r\nstill it is so closely connected with eloquence that it cannot be\r\ndismissed without a few words. It has been already stated that arms,\r\npolitics, and the bar were the avenues to distinction; and thus many an\r\nambitious youth, who learned the art of war in a foreign campaign under\r\nsome experienced general, occupied himself also at home in the forum.\r\nNot only was the young patrician conscious that he could not efficiently\r\ndischarge his first duty to his clients without possessing sufficient\r\nability and knowledge to defend their rights in a court of law, but this\r\nwas an effectual method of showing his fitness for a public career.\r\nEminence as a jurisconsult opened a direct path to eminence as a\r\nstatesman.[420] He must be like Pollio, “_Insigne mæstis præsidium\r\nreis_,” as well as “_Consulenti curiæ_.”[421]\r\n\r\nHence the complicated principles of jurisprudence and of the Roman\r\nconstitution became a necessary part of a liberal education. The\r\nbrilliant orator, indeed, did sometimes affect to look down with\r\ncontempt on such black-letter and antiquarian lore, and stigmatize it as\r\npedantry;[422] but still common sense compelled the sober-minded to\r\nacknowledge the necessity of the study. They saw that in the courts\r\neloquence could only be considered as the handmaid to legal knowledge,\r\neven though the saying of Quintilian were true—“_Et leges ipsæ nihil\r\nvalent nisi actoris idoneâ voce munitæ_.”[423] When, therefore, a Roman\r\nyouth had completed his studies under his teacher of rhetoric, he not\r\nonly frequented the forum in order to learn the practical application of\r\nthe oratorical principles which he had acquired, and frequently took\r\nsome celebrated orator as a model, but also studied the principles of\r\njurisprudence under an eminent jurist, and attended the consultations in\r\nwhich they gave to their clients their expositions of law. In fact the\r\nyoung Roman acquired his legal knowledge in the _atrium_ of the\r\njurisconsult, somewhat in the same manner that the law student of the\r\npresent day pursues his education in the chambers of a barrister. He\r\nstudied the subject practically and empirically rather than in its\r\ntheory and general principles.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the knowledge which we possess is derived from the labours of\r\nwriters who flourished long after constitutional liberty had expired.\r\n\r\nThe earliest systematic works on Roman law were the Enchiridion or\r\nManual of Pomponius, and the Institutes of Gaius, who flourished in the\r\ntimes of Hadrian and the Antonines. Both these works were for a long\r\ntime lost, although numerous fragments were preserved in the Pandects or\r\nDigest of Justinian. In 1816, however, Niebuhr discovered a palimpsest\r\nMS., in which the Epistles of St. Jerome were written over the erased\r\nInstitutes of Gaius. But owing to the decisions and interpretations of\r\nthe great practising jurists, to the want of any system of reporting and\r\nrecording, and to the numerous misunderstandings of the Roman historians\r\nrespecting the laws and constitutional history of their country, the\r\nwhole subject long continued in a state of confusion: new contradictory\r\ntheories had been gradually introduced, and old difficulties had not\r\nbeen explained and reconciled. Gian Baptista Vico, in his _Scienza\r\nNova_, was the first who dispelled the clouds of error and reduced it to\r\na system; and his example was afterwards so successfully followed by\r\nNiebuhr, that modern students can understand the subject more clearly,\r\nand have a more comprehensive antiquarian knowledge of it, than the\r\nwriters of the Augustan age.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Roman laws were the _Leges Regiæ_, which were collected and\r\ncodified by Sextus Papirius, and were hence called the Papirian Code.\r\nBut these were rude and unconnected—simply a collection of isolated\r\nenactments. The laws of the Twelve Tables stand next in point of\r\nantiquity. They exhibited the first attempts at regular system, and\r\nimbodied not only legislative enactments but legal principles.[424] So\r\npopular were they, that when Cicero was a child every Roman boy\r\ncommitted them to memory as our children learn their catechism,[425] and\r\nthe great orator laments that in the course of his lifetime this\r\npractice had become obsolete. The explanation of these laws was a\r\nprivilege confined to the pontifical college. This body alone prescribed\r\nthe form of pleading, and published the days on which the courts were\r\nheld. Hence, not only the whole practice and exposition of the law was\r\nin the hands of the patricians, but they had also the power of\r\nobstructing at their pleasure all legal business. But in the censorship\r\nof Appius Claudius, his secretary, Cn. Flavius, set up, at the\r\nsuggestion of Appius, a Calendar in the Forum, which made known to the\r\npublic the days on which legal business could be transacted. In vain the\r\npatricians endeavoured to maintain their monopoly by the invention of\r\nnew formulæ, called Notes, for Tiberius Coruncanius, the first plebeian\r\nPontifex Maximus, who was consul A. U. C. 474, opened a public school of\r\njurisprudence, and in the middle of the next century[426] the “Notes”\r\nwere published by Sextus Ælius Catus.\r\n\r\nThe oral traditional expositions of these laws formed the groundwork of\r\nthe Roman civil law. To these were added from time to time the decrees\r\nof the people (plebiscita,) the acts of the senate (senatus-consulta,)\r\nand the prætorian edicts, which announced the principles on which each\r\nsuccessive prætor purposed to administer the statute law.\r\n\r\nSuch were the various elements out of which the whole body of Roman law\r\nwas composed; and in such early times was the subject diligently studied\r\nand expounded that the latter half of the sixth century A. U. C. was\r\nrich in jurists whose powers are celebrated in history. Besides S. Ælius\r\nCatus, already mentioned, P. Licinius Crassus, surnamed “the rich,” who\r\nwas consul A. U. C. 549, is mentioned by Livy[427] as learned in the\r\npontifical law, the canon law of the ancient Romans. L. Acilius also\r\nwrote commentaries on the laws of the Twelve Tables; and to these may be\r\nadded T. Manlius Torquatus, consul A. U. C. 589, S. Fabius Pictor, and\r\nanother member of the same distinguished family, Q. Fabius Labeo, Cato\r\nthe censor and his son Porcius Cato Licinianus, and lastly P. Cornelius\r\nNasica, whose services as a jurist were recognised by the grant of a\r\nhouse at the public expense.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent jurists who adorned the next century were the Scævolæ.\r\nIn their family the profession of the jurisconsult seems to have been\r\nhereditary; of so many bearing that distinguished name, it might have\r\nbeen said that their house was the oracle of the whole state; “Domus\r\njurisconsulti totius oraculum civitatis.”[428] Quintus, the augur, was\r\nCicero’s first instructor in the science of the law: his cousin Publius\r\nenjoyed also a high reputation; and Quintus, the son of Publius, who\r\nbecame Cicero’s tutor after the death of his elder kinsman, combined the\r\ngenius of an orator with the erudition of a jurist, and was called by\r\nhis distinguished pupil “the greatest orator among jurists, and the\r\ngreatest jurist among orators.” The compiler of the digest also quotes\r\nas authorities M. Manilius and M. Junius Brutus.[429] Manilius is one of\r\nthe characters introduced in Cicero’s dialogue _de Republica_: he was\r\nconsul A. U. C. 604, and is said to have been the author of seven legal\r\ntreatises; but of all these, except three, Cicero denies the authority.\r\nBrutus was the son of the ambassador of that name who was employed in\r\nthe war with Perseus, and left a treatise in three books on the civil\r\nlaw.[430]\r\n\r\nIn the next century flourished one Ælius Gallus, who was somewhat senior\r\nto Cicero, and was the author of a treatise on the signification of law\r\nterms. Several of his definitions are given by Festus, and fragments are\r\npreserved by A. Gellius,[431] and in the Digest. By some he has been\r\nconsidered identical with Ælius Gallus, the prefect of Egypt in the\r\nreign of Augustus,[432] who was the friend of the geographer Strabo; but\r\nas there is little doubt that he is quoted by Varro,[433] such identity\r\nis impossible, since Varro died B. C. 28, and yet he speaks of Gallus as\r\nan aged man. Another distinguished jurist of this era was his namesake\r\nC. Aquilius Gallus. He was a pupil of Q. Mucius Scævola, and surpassed\r\nall his contemporaries in that black-letter knowledge of law, which in\r\nolden time was more highly valued than in the more brilliant days of\r\nCicero. Learning then began to be ridiculed and lightly esteemed, and\r\noratorical powers were more admired in proportion as the Roman mind\r\nbecame more alive to the refinements and beauties of language.\r\n\r\nBut Gallus was most eminent as a law reformer. The written law of Rome\r\npresented by its technicality the greatest impediments to actions on the\r\nunwritten principle of common right and equity. To obviate this he\r\ninvented legal fictions, _i. e._ formulæ by which the effects of the\r\nstatute could be annulled without the necessity of abrogating the\r\nstatute itself. His practice must have been large, for Pliny mentions\r\nthat he was the owner of a splendid palace on the Viminal Hill.[434] In\r\nB. C. 67, he served the office of prætor together with Cicero, and both\r\nbefore and after that he frequently sat as one of the judices. Cicero\r\npleaded before him in the defence both of Cæcina and Cluentius.\r\n\r\nBesides Aquilius Gallus, three of the most distinguished jurists, who\r\nwere a few years senior to Cicero, owed their legal knowledge to the\r\ninstructions of Mucius Scævola. These were—C. Juventius, Sextus\r\nPapirius, and L. Lucilius Balbus, the last of whom is mentioned by\r\nCicero,[435] and his works are quoted by his eminent pupil Sulpicius\r\nRufus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              GRAMMARIANS.\r\n\r\nTowards the conclusion of this literary period a great increase took\r\nplace in the numbers of those learned men whom the Romans termed\r\n“_Litterati_,”[436] but afterwards, following the custom of the Greeks,\r\nGrammarians, (_Grammatici_.[437]) To them literature was under deep\r\nobligations. Although few of them were authors, and all of them men of\r\nacquired learning rather than of original genius, they exercised a\r\npowerful influence over the public mind as professors, lecturers,\r\ncritics, and school-masters. By them the youths of the best families not\r\nonly were imbued with a taste for Greek philosophy and poetry, but also\r\nwere taught to appreciate the literature of their own country.\r\n\r\nSuetonius places at the head of the class Livius Andronicus and Ennius;\r\nbut their fame as poets eclipses their reputation as mere critics and\r\ncommentators.\r\n\r\nThe first professed grammarian whom he mentions is Crates Mallotes, who,\r\nbetween the first and second Punic wars, was sent to Rome by Attalus.\r\nThe unfortunate ambassador fell into an open drain and broke his leg,\r\nand beguiled the tediousness of his confinement by reading a course of\r\nphilological lectures. After him C. Octavius Lampadio edited the works\r\nof Nævius; Q. Vargunteius those of Ennius; and Lælius, Archelaus,\r\nVectius, and Q. Philocomus read and explained to a circle of auditors\r\nthe Satires of Lucilius.\r\n\r\nMost of these grammarians were emancipated slaves: some were Greeks,\r\nsome barbarians. Sævius Nicanor and Aurelius Opilius were freedmen: the\r\nlatter had belonged to the household of some Epicurean philosopher.\r\nCornelius Epicadus was a freedman of Sulla, and completed the\r\nCommentaries which his patron left unfinished, and Lenæus was freedman\r\nof Pompey the Great. M. Pompilius Andronicus was a Syrian; M. Antonius\r\nGnipho, though of ingenuous birth, a Gaul. Servius Clodius, however, and\r\nL. Ælius Lanuvinus were Roman knights. Nor were the labours of these\r\nindustrious scholars confined to Rome, or even to Italy; for Octavius\r\nTeucer, Siscennius Iacchus and Oppius Chares gave instructions in the\r\nprovince of Gallia Togata.\r\n\r\nTo the names already mentioned may be added those of L. Ælius Stilo, who\r\naccompanied L. Metellus Numidicus into exile, and Valerius Cato, who not\r\nonly taught the art of poetry, but was himself a poet.\r\n\r\nWe have now traced from its infancy the rise and progress of Roman\r\nliterature, and watched the gradual opening of the national intellect.\r\nThe dawn has gently broken, the light has steadily increased, and is now\r\nsucceeded by the noon-day brilliance of the “golden age.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK II.\r\n                    THE ERA OF CICERO AND AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n   PROSE THE TEST OF THE CONDITION OF A LANGUAGE—DRAMATIC LITERATURE\r\nEXTINCT—MIMES—DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ROMAN AND GREEK MIMES—LABERIUS—PASSAGES\r\n      FROM HIS POETRY—MATIUS CALVENA—MIMIAMBI—PUBLIUS SYRUS—ROMAN\r\n      PANTOMIME—ITS LICENTIOUSNESS—PRINCIPAL ACTORS OF PANTOMIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the period upon which we are now entering, Roman literature\r\narrived at its greatest perfection. The time at which it attained the\r\nhighest point of excellence is fixed by Niebuhr[438] about A. U. C. 680,\r\nwhen Cicero was between thirty and forty years old. Poetry, indeed,\r\nstill continued to improve, as regarded metrical structure and diction,\r\nin finish, smoothness, and harmony. There is _ex. gr._ in these respects\r\na marked difference between the works of Lucretius and Virgil; but\r\nnevertheless the principles of language now became fixed and settled. In\r\nfact, the condition of a language must be judged of by its prose; so\r\nmust likewise the state of perfection to which its literature has\r\nattained. If poetry could be with propriety assumed as the standard, the\r\ncommencement of the empire of Augustus would constitute the best age of\r\nLatin literature, rather than the time when the forum echoed with the\r\neloquence of Cicero; but in the two ages of Cicero and Augustus, taken\r\ntogether as forming one era, is comprehended the golden age both of\r\npoetry and prose.\r\n\r\nDramatic literature, however, never recovered from the trance into which\r\nit had fallen. The stage had not altogether lost that popularity which\r\nit had possessed in the days of Attius and Terence, for Æsopus and\r\nRoscius, the former the great tragedian, the latter the favourite\r\ncomedian, in the time of Cicero, amassed great wealth. Æsopus lived\r\nliberally,[439] and yet bequeathed a fortune to his son, and Roscius is\r\nsaid to have earned daily the sum of thirty-two pounds.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, also, the degradation attached to the social position\r\nof an actor, both these eminent artists enjoyed the friendship of Cicero\r\nand other great men. They brought to the study of their profession\r\nindustry, taste, talent, and learning, and these qualities were\r\nappreciated. Æsopus was on one occasion encored a countless number of\r\ntimes (_millies_)[440] by an enthusiastic audience, and Roscius was\r\nelevated by Sulla to the equestrian dignity. But although the standard\r\nRoman plays were constantly represented, dramatic literature had become\r\nextinct. No one wrote comedy at all, and the tragedies of Valgius Rufus\r\nand Asinius Pollio were only intended for reading or recitation. Nor, as\r\nhas been already shown, does the Thyestes of Varus really form an\r\nexception to this statement.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic entertainments which had now taken the place of comedy and\r\ntragedy were termed mimes.\r\n\r\nTheir distinguishing appellation was derived from the Greek, but they\r\nentirely differed from those compositions to which the Greeks applied\r\nthat title. The latter were written not in verse, but in prose;[441]\r\nthey were dialogues, not dramatic pieces, and though they were exhibited\r\nat certain festivals, and the parts supported by actors, they were never\r\nrepresented on the stage. Even when Sophron, whose compositions were\r\nadmired and imitated by Plato,[442] raised them to their highest degree\r\nof perfection, and made them vehicles of serious moral lessons mingling\r\ntogether ludicrous buffoonery with grave philosophy, their language was\r\nonly a rhythmical prose, probably somewhat resembling that in which the\r\ncelebrated despatch of Hippocrates[443] was written. Some idea may be\r\nformed of their nature from the fact that the idylls of Theocritus were\r\nimitated from the mimes of Sophron, and that Persius took them for his\r\nmodel in his peculiarly dramatic satires.[444]\r\n\r\nThe Roman mimes were laughable imitations of manners and persons. So far\r\nthey combined features of comedy and farce; for comedy represents the\r\ncharacters of a class—farce those of individuals. Their essence was that\r\nof the modern pantomime; mimicry and burlesque dialogue were only\r\naccidentally introduced. Their coarseness and even indecency[445]\r\ngratified the love of broad humour which characterized the Roman people.\r\nThey became successful rivals of comedy, and thus came to be admitted on\r\nthe public stage. It is most probable that like other dramatic\r\nexhibitions, they originally grew out of the Fabulæ Atellanæ, which they\r\nafterwards superseded. But notwithstanding their indecency, their satire\r\nupon the living, and their burlesque representations of the illustrious\r\ndead, when exhibited at funeral games, they had sometimes, like the\r\nmimes of Sophron, a moral character, and abounded in shrewd wisdom and\r\nnoble sentiments.[446] Schlegel asserts that there is a great affinity\r\nbetween the Roman mimes and the pasquinades and harlequinades of modern\r\nItaly. He conjectures that in them may be traced the germ of the\r\n_Comedie dell’ Arte_, and states that the very picture of Polichinello\r\nis found in some of the frescoes of Pompeii.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, when mimes became established as popular favourites, the\r\ndialogue or written part of the entertainment occupied a more prominent\r\nposition, and was written in verse, like that of tragedy or comedy. In\r\nthe dictatorship of Julius Cæsar, a Roman knight, named Decius Laberius,\r\nbecame eminent for his mimes. Respecting his merits, we have few\r\nopportunities of forming a judgment, as the fragments of his\r\nwritings[447] are but few and short; but Horace[448] speaks of them in\r\nunfavourable language, and finds fault with their carelessness and want\r\nof regular plan. He was born about B. C. 107,[449] and died B. C. 45, at\r\nPuteoli, (Pozzuoli.) The profession of an actor of mimes was infamous;\r\nbut Laberius was a writer, not an actor. It happened, however, that P.\r\nSyrus, who had been first the slave, then the freedman and pupil of\r\nLaberius, and lastly a professional actor, challenged all his brethren\r\nto a trial of improvisatorial skill. Cæsar entreated Laberius to enter\r\nthe lists, and offered him five hundred sestertia (about 4,000_l._)\r\nLaberius did not submit to the degradation for the sake of the money,\r\nbut he was afraid to refuse. The only method of retaliation in his power\r\nwas sarcasm. His part was that of a slave, and when his master scourged\r\nhim, he exclaimed, “Porro, Quirites, libertatem perdimus!” His words\r\nwere received with a round of applause, and the audience fixed their\r\neyes on Cæsar. On another occasion his attack on the Dictator was almost\r\nthreatening:—\r\n\r\n              Necesse est multos timeat quem multi timent.\r\n\r\nHe appears to have been always quick and ready in repartee. When, on\r\nbeing vanquished by his adversary Syrus, the Dictator said to him with a\r\nsneer—\r\n\r\n                Favente tibi me victus es Laberi a Syro,\r\n\r\nHe replied with the following sad but true reflections:—\r\n\r\n           Non possunt primi esse omnes omni in tempore,\r\n           Summum ad gradum cum claritatis veneris\r\n           Consistes ægre; et quum descendas decides;\r\n           Cecidi ego, cadet qui sequitur, laus est publica.\r\n\r\nCæsar, however, restored to him the rank and equestrian privileges of\r\nwhich his act had deprived him; but still he could not recover the\r\nrespect of his countrymen. As he passed the orchestra in his way to the\r\nstalls of the knights, Cicero cried out, “If we were not so crowded, I\r\nwould make room for you here.” Laberius replied, alluding to Cicero’s\r\nlukewarmness as a political partisan, “I am astonished that you should\r\nbe crowded, as you generally sit on two stools.” The calm and feeling\r\nrebuke with which, in the prologue to his mime, he remonstrated against\r\nthe tyranny of Cæsar, is singularly spirited and beautiful:—\r\n\r\n  Necessitas, cujus cursus transversi impetum\r\n  Voluerunt multi effugere, pauci potuerunt,\r\n  Quo me detrusit pæne extremis sensibus?\r\n  Quem nulla ambitio, nulla unquam largitio,\r\n  Nullus timor, vis nulla, nulla auctoritas\r\n  Movere potuit in juventa de statu;\r\n  Ecce in senecta ut facile labefecit loco\r\n  Viri excellentis mente clemente edita\r\n  Submissa placide blandiloquens oratio!\r\n  Etenim ipsi Dii negare cui nihil potuerunt,\r\n  Hominem me denegare quis possit pati?\r\n  Ergo bis tricenis actis annis sine nota\r\n  Eques Romanus lare egressus meo\r\n  Domum revertas mimus; Nimirum hoc die\r\n  Uno plus vixi mihi quam vivendum fuit\r\n  Fortuna, immoderata in bono æque atque in malo,\r\n  Si tibi erat libitum literarum laudibus\r\n  Floris cacumen nostræ famæ frangere,\r\n  Cur quum vigebam membris præviridantibus,\r\n  Satisfacere populo et tali cum poteram viro,\r\n  Non flexibilem me concurvasti ut carperes?\r\n  Nunc me quo dejicis? quid ad scenam affero?\r\n  Decorem formæ, an dignitatem corporis,\r\n  Animi virtutem, an vocis jucundæ sonum?\r\n  Ut hedera serpens vires arboreas necat,\r\n  Ita me vetustas amplexa annorum enecat,\r\n  Sepulchri similis nihil nomen retines.\r\n\r\n  O, strong Necessity! of whose swift course\r\n  So many feel, so few escape the force,\r\n  Whither, ah whither, in thy prone career,\r\n  Hast thou decreed this dying frame to bear?\r\n  Me, in my better days, nor foe, nor friend,\r\n  Nor threat, nor bribe, nor vanity could bend;\r\n  Now, lured by flattery, in my weaker age\r\n  I sink my knighthood and ascend the stage.\r\n  Yet muse not therefore—how shall man gainsay\r\n  Him whom the Deities themselves obey?\r\n  Sixty long years I’ve lived without disgrace\r\n  A Roman knight!—let dignity give place;\r\n  I’m Cæsar’s actor now, and compass more\r\n  In one short hour than all my life before.\r\n  O Fortune! fickle source of good and ill,\r\n  If here to place me was thy sovereign will,\r\n  Why, when I’d youth and faculties to please\r\n  So great a master, and such guests as these,\r\n  Why not compel me then, malicious power,\r\n  To the hard task of this degrading hour?\r\n  Where now, in what profound abyss of shame,\r\n  Dost thou conspire with Fate to sink my name?\r\n  Whence are my hopes? What voice can age supply\r\n  To charm the ear, what grace to please the eye?\r\n  Where is the active energy and art,\r\n  The look that guides its passion to the heart?\r\n  Age creeps like ivy o’er my withered trunk,\r\n  Its bloom all blasted and its vigour shrunk;\r\n  A tomb, where nothing but a name remains\r\n  To tell the world whose ashes it contains.\r\n                                                        _Cumberland._\r\n\r\nAnother poet of this age who composed mimes was C. Matius, surnamed,\r\nfrom his baldness, Calvena. His mimes were termed _Mimiambi_, because he\r\nwrote in the iambic measure,[450] and he was also a translator of the\r\nIliad as well as the author of a work on cookery. His principal merit is\r\nsaid to have been his skill in enriching his native language by the\r\nintroduction of new words.[451] He was somewhat younger than Laberius,\r\nand enjoyed the friendship of the greatest amongst his contemporaries.\r\nHis intimacy with Julius Cæsar,[452] to whom he was warmly\r\nattached,[453] and afterwards with Augustus,[454] gave him great\r\ninfluence;[455] but he never took much part in the political strife\r\nwhich imbittered his times, nor did he use his influence in order to\r\nprocure his own advancement.\r\n\r\nHis retired habits and love of literary leisure saved him from seeking\r\nhis happiness in the excitements of ambition. Cicero, who loved him\r\ndearly, often mentions him in his letters, and pays a compliment[456] to\r\nhis learning and amiability. An interesting letter of his, which is\r\npreserved in the collection of Cicero’s epistles to his friends,[457]\r\nshows that he possessed an accomplished mind and an affectionate heart.\r\nIt cannot be supposed, therefore, that his _Mimiambi_ were debased by\r\nthe too common faults of coarseness and immodesty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PUBLIUS SYRUS.\r\n\r\nPublius Syrus was, as his name implies, originally a Syrian slave, and\r\ntook his prænomen from the master who gave him his freedom. All that is\r\nknown respecting his life has already been stated in the account of\r\nLaberius. The commendations which his mimes received from the ancients,\r\nespecially from Cicero,[458] Seneca,[459] and Pliny,[460] prove them to\r\nhave been much read and admired. The fragments which still remain are\r\nmarked by wit and neatness, and the shrewd wisdom of proverbial\r\nphilosophy. Tradition has also recorded a _bon-mot_ of his, which is as\r\nwitty as it is severe. Seeing once an ill-tempered man, named Mucius, in\r\nlow spirits, he remarked, “Either some bad fortune has happened to\r\nMucius, or some good fortune to one of his friends.” An accurate\r\nknowledge of human nature, exhibited in pointed and terse language, most\r\nprobably constituted the charm of this species of scenic literature. The\r\nlarge collection of his proverbial sayings, entitled _P. Syri\r\nSententiæ_, are by no means all genuine; but the nucleus around which\r\nthe collection has grown by successive additions is undoubtedly his, and\r\nthose which are the work of after ages are formed after the model of his\r\napothegms.\r\n\r\nThe Roman pantomime differed somewhat from the mime—it was a ballet of\r\naction performed by a single dancer. It was first introduced in its\r\ncomplete form in the reign of Augustus: and Suidas,[461] misquoting a\r\npassage from Zosimus,[462] groundlessly attributes the invention to the\r\nemperor himself. As the mime bore some resemblance to the Atellan\r\nfarces, so the pantomime resembled the histrionic performances\r\nintroduced by Livius Andronicus. In both, the person who recited the\r\nwords (_canticum_[463]) was different from him who represented the\r\ncharacters. In the pantomime, the _canticum_ was sung by a chorus\r\narrayed at the back of the stage. Until the times of the later emperors,\r\nwhen vice was paraded with unblushing effrontery, women never acted in\r\npantomime; but the exhibition itself was sensual and licentious in its\r\ncharacter,[464] and the actors of it were deservedly deemed infamous,\r\nand forbidden by Tiberius to hold any intercourse with Romans of\r\nequestrian or senatorial dignity.[465] Nero, however, outraged public\r\ndecency by himself appearing in pantomime.[466] Fortunate was it for the\r\ndignity of Rome that the face of the emperor was concealed behind a mask\r\nwhich, unlike the performers in the mimes, the pantomimic actors always\r\nwore. The players not only exhibited the human figure in the most\r\ngraceful attitudes, but represented every passion and emotion with such\r\ntruth, that the spectators could without difficulty understand the\r\nstory. Sometimes the scenes represented were founded upon the Greek\r\ntragic drama; but for its purifying effect was substituted the awakening\r\nof licentious passions.\r\n\r\nThese were the exhibitions which threw such discredit on the stage—which\r\ncalled forth the well-deserved attacks of the early Christian fathers,\r\nand caused them to declare that whoever attended them was unworthy of\r\nthe name of Christians. Had the drama not been so abused, had it\r\nretained its original purity, and carried out the object attributed to\r\nit by Aristotle, they would have seen in it not a nursery of vice, but a\r\nschool of virtue—not only an innocent amusement, but a powerful engine\r\nto form the taste, to improve the morals, and to purify the feelings of\r\na people.\r\n\r\nThe principal actors of pantomime in the reign of Augustus were\r\nBathyllus, Hylas, and Pylades. In the reign of Nero the art was\r\npractised by Latinus,[467] and Paris, who taught the emperor to dance,\r\nand subsequently was put to death by Nero when he became his rival for\r\npopular applause.[468] But those who attained the highest degree of\r\npopularity were another Latinus, and another Paris, who flourished in\r\nthe reign of Domitian. Both have been immortalized in the epigrams of\r\nMartial.[469] To the former, Martial attributes the power to fascinate\r\nsuch stern and rigid moralists as resembled Cato, the Curii, and\r\nFabricii. The epitaph concludes with these lines:—\r\n\r\n              Vos me laurigeri parasitum dicite Phœbi,\r\n              Roma sui famulum dum sciat esse Jovis.\r\n\r\n              Say ye I gained the laurelled Phœbus’ love,\r\n              So that Rome hails me servant of her Jove.\r\n\r\nThe latter, by his popularity, acquired great influence at court, but\r\nhis profligacy proved his ruin. He intrigued with the empress Domitia;\r\nand Domitian consequently divorced his wife, and caused Paris to be\r\nassassinated. He has furnished a plot and a hero to Massinger’s play of\r\nthe “Roman Actor.” The simple and beautiful epitaph written to his\r\nmemory by Martial is as follows:—\r\n\r\n             Quisquis Flaminiam teris, viator,\r\n             Noli nobile præterire marmor.\r\n             Urbis deliciæ, salesque Nili,\r\n             Ars et gratia, lusus et voluptas;\r\n             Romani decus et dolor theatri,\r\n             Atque omnes Veneres, Cupidinesque,\r\n             Hoc sunt condita, quo Paris, sepulchro.\r\n\r\n             Whoe’er thou art, O traveller, stay!\r\n             Mark what proud tomb adorns the way.\r\n             The town’s delight, the wit of Nile,\r\n             Art, grace, mirth, pleasure, sport and smile:\r\n             The honour of the Roman stage,\r\n             The grief and sorrow of the age:\r\n             All Venuses and Loves lie here\r\n             Buried in Paris’ sepulchre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n LUCRETIUS A POET RATHER THAN A PHILOSOPHER—HIS LIFE—EPIC STRUCTURE OF\r\nHIS POEM—VARIETY OF HIS POETRY—EXTRACTS FROM HIS POEM—ARGUMENT OF IT—THE\r\n      EPICUREAN DOCTRINES CONTAINED IN IT—MORALITY OF EPICURUS AND\r\nLUCRETIUS—TESTIMONIES OF VIRGIL AND OVID—CATULLUS: HIS LIFE, CHARACTER,\r\n                 AND POETRY—OTHER POETS OF THIS PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LUCRETIUS CARUS (BORN B. C. 95.)\r\n\r\nLucretius Carus might claim a place amongst philosophers as well as\r\npoets, for his poem marks an epoch both in poetry and philosophy. But\r\nhis philosophy is a mere reflexion from that of Greece, whilst his\r\npoetry is bright with the rays of original genius. A delineation,\r\ntherefore, of his characteristics as a writer of the imagination, will\r\npresent the more accurate idea of the place which he occupies amongst\r\nRoman authors. It was no empty boast of his, that, as a poet, he\r\ndeserved the praise of originality—that he had opened a path through the\r\nterritory of the muse, untrodden before by poet’s foot—that he had drawn\r\nfrom a virgin fountain, and culled fresh flowers whence the Muse had\r\nnever yet sought them to wreathe a garland for the poet’s brow.[470]\r\n\r\nFew materials exist for the compilation of his biography. From two\r\npassages[471] in his work, in which he states that his native language\r\nwas Latin, it is clear that he was born within the limits of Italy. The\r\ndate of his birth is generally fixed B. C. 95.[472] The prevalence of\r\nthe Epicurean philosophy, and the additional popularity with which his\r\ntalents invested the fashionable creed, combined to raise him to the\r\nequestrian dignity; and, consistently with his cold and hopeless\r\natheism—his proud disbelief in a superintending Providence—he died by\r\nhis own hand in the prime of life and in the forty-fourth year of his\r\nage.[473] The story that his work was written in the lucid intervals of\r\na madness produced by a love-potion, as well as his residence at Athens\r\nfor the purpose of study, rest upon no foundation.\r\n\r\nHis poem _On the Nature of Things_ is divided into six books, and is\r\nwritten in imitation of that of Empedocles, who is the subject of his\r\nwarmest praise and admiration. Whilst its subject is philosophical and\r\nits purpose didactic, its unity of design, the one point of view from\r\nwhich he regards the various doctrines of the master whose principles he\r\nadopts, claims for it the rank of an epic poem.\r\n\r\nThis epic structure prevents it from being a complete and systematic\r\nsurvey of the whole Epicurean philosophy; but, notwithstanding this\r\ndeficiency in point of comprehensiveness, the exactness and fidelity\r\nwith which he represents those doctrines which he enunciates, renders\r\nhim deserving of the credit of having given to his countrymen, as far as\r\nepic writing permitted, an accurate view of the philosophical system\r\nwhich then enjoyed the highest degree of popularity.\r\n\r\nAlthough Greek philosophy furnished Lucretius with his subject, and a\r\nGreek poem served as a model, he also saw and valued the capabilities of\r\nthe Latin language—he wielded at will its power of embodying the noblest\r\nthoughts, and showed how its copious and flexible properties could\r\novercome the hard technicalities of science. Grand as were his\r\nconceptions, the language of Lucretius is not inferior to them in\r\nmajesty. Without violating philosophical accuracy, he never appears to\r\nfeel it a restraint to his muse: his fancy is always lively, his\r\nimagination has free scope even when his thoughts are fixed in the\r\nabstrusest theories, and engaged in the most subtle argumentation.[474]\r\n\r\nThe great beauty of the poetry of Lucretius is its variety. One might\r\nexpect sublimity in the philosopher who penetrates the secrets of the\r\nnatural world, and discloses to the eye of man the hidden causes of its\r\nwonderful phenomena. His object was a lofty one; for, although the\r\nirrational absurdities of the national creed drove him into the opposite\r\nevils of skepticism and unbelief, his aim was to set the intellect free\r\nfrom the trammels of superstition. But besides grandeur and sublimity we\r\nfind the totally different poetical qualities of softness and\r\ntenderness. Rome had long known nothing but war, and was now rent by\r\nthat worst and most demoralizing kind of war, civil dissension.\r\nLucretius yearned for peace; and his prayer, that the fabled goddess of\r\nall that is beautiful in nature would heal the wounds which discord had\r\nmade, is distinguished by tenderness and pathos even more than by\r\nsublimity. The whole passage is superior to the poetry of Ovid in force,\r\nalthough inferior in facility. His versification is not so smooth and\r\nharmonious as that of Virgil, who flourished in a period when the\r\nlanguage had attained a higher degree of perfection, and the Roman ear\r\nwas more educated, and therefore more delicately attuned, but it is\r\nnever harsh and rugged, and always falls upon the ear with a swelling\r\nand sonorous melody. Virgil appreciated his excellence, and imitated not\r\nonly single expressions, but almost entire verses and passages.[475]\r\n\r\nAs an example of sublimity, few passages can equal that in which he\r\ndescribes the prostration of human intellect under the grievous\r\nsuperstition, the dauntless purpose of Epicurus to free men from her\r\noppressive rule, and to enable him to burst open the portals of Nature’s\r\ntreasure-house, and thus gain a victory which will place him on an\r\nequality with the inhabitants of heaven:—\r\n\r\n        Humana ante oculos fede quom vita jaceret\r\n        In terris, oppressa gravi sub Religione,\r\n        Quæ caput a cœli regionibus ostendebat,\r\n        Horribili super aspectu mortalibus instans;\r\n        Primum Graius homo mortales tendere contra\r\n        Est oculos ausus, primusque obsistere contra;\r\n        Quem neque fama deûm nec fulmina nec minitanti\r\n        Murmure compressit cœlum, sed eo magis acrem\r\n        Irritât animi virtutem, effringere ut arcta\r\n        Naturæ primus portarum claustra cupiret.\r\n        Ergo vivida vis animi pervicit et extra\r\n        Processit longe flammantia mœnia mondi,\r\n        Atque omne immensum peragravit mente animoque;\r\n        Unde refert nobis victor, quid possit oriri,\r\n        Quid nequeat; finita potestas denique quoique\r\n        Quanam sit ratione, atque alte terminus hærens.\r\n        Quare Religio, pedibus subjecta, vicissim\r\n        Obteritur; nos exæquat victoria cœlo.\r\n                                                    Lib. i. 63.\r\n\r\nThe idea which the poet here presents to the mind of his readers is of\r\nthe same kind with that which pervades the writings of the Greek\r\ntragedians: it is that of the limited energies of mortals resolutely\r\nstruggling with a superior and almost irresistible power.\r\n\r\nThe thrilling narrative of the plague at Athens, with all its physical\r\nand moral horrors, is one of the most heart-rending specimens of\r\ndescriptive poetry. The stern rejection of all fear of death, though\r\nbased upon a denial of the immortality of the soul, is a noble burst of\r\npoetical as well as philosophical enthusiasm; and the fifth book\r\ndisplays that perfect finish and accomplished grace which characterizes\r\nall the best Roman poets. Amongst the most affecting passages may be\r\nenumerated those which describe the early sorrows of the human race, and\r\nthe grief of the bereaved animal whose young one has been slain in\r\nsacrifice.[476] Two other fine passages are the philosophical\r\nexplanation of Tartarus, and the panoramic view of the tempest of human\r\ndesires, seen from the rocky heights of philosophy—a glorious\r\ndescriptive piece which has been imitated by Lord Bacon.\r\n\r\nThe following lines show how beautifully the poet has caught the spirit\r\nand feeling of Greek fancy, and how capable the Latin language now was\r\nof adequately expressing them:—\r\n\r\n       Aulide quo pacto Triviai virginis aram\r\n       Iphianassai turparunt sanguine fede\r\n       Ductores Danaum delectei, prima virorum\r\n       Cui simul infula, virgineos circumdata comtus,\r\n       Ex utraque pari malarum parte profusa est;\r\n       Et mœstum simul ante aras astare parentem\r\n       Sensit, et hunc propter ferrum celare ministros,\r\n       Aspectuque suo lacrumas effundere civeis;\r\n       Muta metu, terram genibus summissa, petebat:\r\n       Nec miseræ prodesse in tali tempore quibat,\r\n       Quod patrio princeps donarat nomine regem\r\n       Nam sublata virum manibus, tremebundaque, ad aras\r\n       Deducta est; non ut, solenni more sacrorum\r\n       Perfecto, posset claro comitari hymenæo;\r\n       Sed, casta incerte, nubendi tempore in ipso,\r\n       Hostia concideret mactatu mœsta parentis,\r\n       Exitus ut classi felix faustusque daretur.\r\n       Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum!\r\n\r\n       By that Diana’s cruel altar flowed\r\n       With innocent and royal virgin’s blood:\r\n       Unhappy maid! with sacred ribands bound,\r\n       Religious pride! and holy garlands crowned;\r\n       To meet an undeserved, untimely fate,\r\n       Led by the Grecian chiefs in pomp and state;\r\n       She saw her father by, whose tears did flow\r\n       In streams—the only pity he could show.\r\n       She saw the crafty priest conceal the knife\r\n       From him, blessed and prepared against her life!\r\n       She saw her citizens, with weeping eyes,\r\n       Unwillingly attend the sacrifice.\r\n       Then, dumb with grief, her tears did pity crave,\r\n       But ’twas beyond her father’s power to save.\r\n       In vain did innocence, youth, and beauty plead;\r\n       In vain the first pledge of his nuptial bed;\r\n       She fell—even now grown ripe for bridal joy—\r\n       To bribe the gods, and buy a wind for Troy.\r\n       So died this innocent, this royal maid:\r\n       Such fiendish acts religion could persuade.      _Creech._\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that there are in the poem of Lucretius many barren\r\nwastes over which are scattered the rubbish and _débris_ of a false\r\nphilosophy; but even in these deserts the oases are numerous enough to\r\nprevent exhaustion and fatigue. They recur too frequently to enumerate\r\nthem all. If the attempt were made, other tastes would still discover\r\nfresh examples.\r\n\r\nThe following is, in a few words, the plan and structure of the\r\npoem:—Its professed object is to emancipate mankind from the debasing\r\neffects of superstition by an exposition of the leading tenets of the\r\nEpicurean school. It is divided into six books. In the first, the poet\r\nenunciates and copiously illustrates the grand axiom of his system of\r\nthe universe, together with the corollaries which necessarily arise from\r\nit. “Nothing is created out of nothing.” He commences also the subject\r\nof the atomic theory. In the second book he pursues the subject of\r\ncreation generally, and the various functions of animal life. The third\r\ntreats of the nature of the soil. The fourth contains the theory of\r\nsensation, especially of sight; of the relation which thought bears to\r\nmatter; of the passions, and especially of the influence of love, both\r\nphysical and moral. The fifth book is devoted to the history of mankind.\r\nThe sixth explains the phenomena of the natural world, including those\r\nof disease and death.\r\n\r\nThe following are the leading Epicurean doctrines imbodied in the\r\npoem:—There are divine beings, but they are neither the\r\ncreators[477] nor the governors of the world.[478] They live in the\r\nenjoyment of perfect happiness and repose, regardless of human\r\naffairs, unaffected by man’s virtues and vices, happiness or misery.\r\nNeither have they the power any more than the will to interfere in\r\nthe affairs of the world, for they cannot resist the eternal laws of\r\nnature and destiny. Whilst, in deference to the innate sense which\r\nrevolts at the denial of a God, he acknowledges the existence of\r\ndivine beings, the proofs which he adduces as derived from his great\r\nmaster are weak and unsatisfactory.[479] The corollary of this\r\ndisbelief in Divine Providence is practical atheism. The ideas which\r\nman entertains of God are false, because they are the mere creations\r\nof the imagination. Ignorant of the real causes which lead to\r\nnatural phenomena, he conjures up these as the machinery to account\r\nfor them.[480] The popular belief is groundless; and yet the poet\r\nbelieves that if this system is overthrown there is nothing to\r\nsupply its place, and hence all worship, whether prayer or praise,\r\nis grovelling superstition.[481] The only true piety consists in\r\ncalm and peaceful contemplation.[482]\r\n\r\nTo those who argue that unbelief leads to ungodliness, his answer is\r\nthat what man calls religion has led to the greatest crimes.[483] He is\r\nnot entirely destitute of the religious sentiment or the principle of\r\nfaith, for he deifies nature[484] and has a veneration for her laws; and\r\nhence his infidelity must be viewed rather in the light of a\r\nphilosophical protest against the degrading results of heathen\r\nsuperstition than a total rejection of the principle of religious faith.\r\n\r\nIt is here that Lucretius seems for awhile to leave the authority of\r\nEpicurus; and with the inspiration of a poet, which is hardly consistent\r\nwith a total absence of veneration and faith, to forsake his cold and\r\nheartless system. Although he asserts that the phenomena of nature are\r\nthe result of a combination of atoms, that these elementary particles\r\nare self-existent and eternal, he seems to invest nature with a sort of\r\npersonality. The warm sensibility of the poet overcomes the cold logic\r\nof the philosopher. Dissatisfied with the ungenial idea of an abstract\r\nlifeless principle, he yearns for the maternal caresses of a being\r\nendued with energies and faculties with which he can sympathize. He\r\ntherefore ascribes to nature an attribute which can only belong to an\r\nintelligent agent having ruling power. Nay, he even goes farther than\r\nthis, and absolutely contradicts the dogmas of the Epicurean school.\r\nEven the works of nature are represented as instinct with life.[485] The\r\nsun is spoken of as a being who, by the warmth of his beams, vivifies\r\nall things: the earth, from whose womb all things spring, fosters and\r\nnurtures all her children. The very stars may possibly be living beings,\r\nperforming their stated motions in search of their proper\r\nsustenance.[486] These are, doubtless, the fancies of the poet rather\r\nthan the grave and serious belief of the philosopher; but they prove how\r\nfalse, hollow, and artificial is a system which pretends to account for\r\ncreation by natural causes, and how earnestly the human mind craves\r\nafter the comfort and support of a personal deity.\r\n\r\nThe denial of the immortality of the soul is inferred from the\r\ndestructibility of the material elements out of which it is composed. It\r\nmust perish immediately that it is deprived of the protection of the\r\nbody.[487] In accordance with this psychical theory, he accounts for the\r\ndifference of human tempers and characters. Character results from the\r\ncombination of the elementary principles:—a predominance of heat\r\nproduces the choleric disposition; that of wind produces timidity; that\r\nof air a calm and equable temper.[488] But this natural constitution,\r\nthe strength of the will, acted upon by education, is able, to a certain\r\nextent, to modify, though it cannot effect a complete change. Thus it is\r\nthat, although moral as well as physical phenomena are produced in\r\naccordance with fixed laws, human ills result from unbridled passions,\r\nand may be remedied by philosophy.\r\n\r\nAlthough, if tried by a Christian standard, the Lucretian morality is by\r\nno means pure,[489] yet even where he permits laxity he is not\r\ninsensible to the moral beauty, the happy and holy results of purity and\r\nchastity.[490] Nor, notwithstanding the assertions of Cicero,[491] can\r\nthe charge of immorality or of a selfish love of impure pleasure be made\r\nagainst Lucretius or Epicurus. The distinction which the latter drew\r\nbetween lawful and unlawful pleasures was severe and uncompromising. The\r\nformer speaks of the hell which the wicked sensualist always carries\r\nwithin his own breast[492]—of the satisfaction of true wisdom,[493] and\r\nof a conscience void of offence.[494]\r\n\r\nAgain, Epicurus was a man of almost Christian gentleness. Stoical\r\ngrossness and contempt of refinement revolted him; the unamiable\r\nseverity of that sect was alien to his nature. He was thus driven to the\r\nopposite extreme; and although he was careful to make pure intellectual\r\npleasure the _summum bonum_, his standard laid him open to objections\r\nfrom his jealous adversaries. The zeal with which many distinguished\r\nfemales devoted themselves to his system, and became his disciples\r\nbecause his doctrines and character especially recommended themselves to\r\nthe female sex, made it easy for his enemies to stigmatize them as\r\n_effeminate_, instead of praising them as _feminine_. With that\r\nilliberality which refused to woman freedom of conduct and a liberal\r\neducation, his adversaries calumniated the characters of his pupils,\r\nrepresented them as unchaste, and their instructor as licentious. Nor\r\ndid they hesitate even to support these accusations by forgeries.[495]\r\n\r\nA careless reception of their calumnies without investigation, added to\r\nthe general, and perhaps wilful, misapprehension which prevailed among\r\nthe Romans in the days of Cicero, led to the misrepresentations which\r\nare found in his writings. These have been handed down to after ages:\r\nand thus the doctrines taught by Epicurus have been loaded with\r\nundeserved obloquy.[496] There is, however, no doubt that Epicurism was\r\nadopted by the Romans in a corrupt form, and that it became fashionable\r\nbecause it was supposed to encourage indifferentism and sensuality. It\r\nis probable, too, that the denial of immortality contributed much to the\r\ndepravation and distortion of his system. Nothing so surely demoralizes\r\nas destroying the hopes of eternity. Man cannot commune with God, or\r\nsoar on high to spiritual things, unless he hopes to be spiritualized\r\nand to see God as He is. Whatever the philosopher may teach as to the\r\ntrue nature of happiness, man will set up his own corrupt standard,\r\nwhich his passions and appetites lead him to prefer: he will act on the\r\nprinciple “Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.” Still it must be\r\nconfessed that the views of Epicurus respecting man’s duty to God were\r\ndisinterested—founded on ideas of the Divine perfections, not merely on\r\nhopes of reward.[497] His views of sensual pleasures were in accordance\r\nwith his simple, frugal life, diametrically opposed to intemperance and\r\nexcess. He taught by example as well as by precept, that he who would be\r\nhappy must cultivate wisdom and justice, because virtue and happiness\r\nare inseparable. He attached his disciples to him by affection rather\r\nthan by admiration; submitted to weakness and sickness with patient\r\nresignation; and died with a heroism which no Stoic could have\r\nsurpassed.\r\n\r\nSuch was the master whom Lucretius followed, and the school to which he\r\nbelonged; and though the sternness of the Roman character breathed into\r\nhis protest against superstition a bolder spirit of defiance than that\r\nof the placid and resigned Greek, his teaching was equally pure and\r\nnoble, and he would have proudly disdained to make philosophy a cloak\r\nfor voluptuous profligacy. Poets who surpassed him in gracefulness, and\r\nwho were fortunate enough to flourish when the Latin language had become\r\nmore plastic, paid due honour to his greatness. Virgil celebrates the\r\nhappiness of that man:—\r\n\r\n         —— qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas,\r\n         Atque metus omnes, et inexorabile fatum\r\n         Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari.[498]\r\n\r\nHis muse is instinct with Lucretian spirit when he describes with such\r\ngraphic skill the murrain attacking the brute creation;[499] and Ovid\r\nexclaims that the sublime strains of Lucretius shall never perish until\r\nthe day shall arrive when the world shall be given up to destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CATULLUS (BORN B. C. 86.)\r\n\r\nContemporary with the great didactic poet, but nine years his junior in\r\nage, flourished C. Valerius Catullus. He was a member of a good family,\r\nresiding on the Lago di Garda, in the neighbourhood of Verona,[500] and\r\nhis father had the honour of frequently receiving Cæsar as his\r\nguest.[501] At an early age he went to Rome, probably for education, but\r\nhis warm temperament and strong passions plunged him into the licentious\r\nexcesses of the capital. During this period of his career, passed in the\r\nindulgence of pleasure and gayety, and in the midst of a dissipated\r\nsociety, he had no more serious occupation than the cultivation of his\r\nliterary tastes and talents. The elegant tenderness of his amatory\r\npoetry made him a favourite with the fair sex, for its licentiousness\r\nwas not out of keeping with the sentiments and conversation prevalent in\r\nthe Roman fashionable world. It must not be supposed that the tone of\r\nsociety amongst the higher classes was pure and moral, like that of\r\nCicero and his friends, or that it was not marked by the same licentious\r\nfreedom which polluted some even of their most graceful poems.\r\n\r\nThe poetry of Catullus was such as might be expected from the tenor of\r\nhis life. The excuse which he made for its character was not a valid\r\none;[502] for the line in Hadrian’s epitaph on Voconius could not\r\npossibly be applied to him:—\r\n\r\n                Lascivus versu, mente pudicus eras.[503]\r\n\r\nHis mistress, whom he addresses under the feigned name of Lesbia, was\r\nreally named Clodia.[504] It has been said that she was the sister of\r\nthe infamous Clodius; but there are no grounds for the assertion.\r\n\r\nA career of extravagance and debauchery terminated in ruin, and though\r\nhis fortune had been originally ample, his affairs became hopelessly\r\nembarrassed; and in order to retrieve them by colonial plunder, he\r\naccompanied Memmius, the friend of Lucretius, when he went as prætor to\r\nBythinia. Owing, however, to the grasping meanness of his patron his\r\nexpectations were disappointed. He returned home “with his purse full of\r\ncobwebs.” Still he enjoyed the privilege of visiting those cities of\r\nGreece and Asia which were the most celebrated for literature and the\r\nfine arts.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to Asia he visited the grave of a brother who had died in\r\nthe Troad, and who was buried on the Rhætian promontory; and a poem\r\nwhich he addressed on the occasion to Hortalus, the dissipated son of\r\nthe orator Hortensius, as well as another dedicated to Manlius, bear\r\nwitness to the warmth of his fraternal affection. The former is a\r\nbeautiful and touching specimen of his elegiac style:—\r\n\r\n             Multas per gentes et multa per æquora vectus,\r\n               Adveni has miseras frater ad inferias.\r\n             Ut te postremo donarem munere mortis\r\n               Et mutum nequidquam alloquerer cinerem.\r\n             Quandoquidem fortuna mihi tete abstulit ipsum\r\n               Has miser indigne frater adempte mihi!\r\n             Nunc tamen interea prisco quæ more parentum\r\n               Tradita sub tristes munera ad inferias\r\n             Accipe fraterno multum manantia fletu\r\n               Atque in perpetuum frater ave atque vale!\r\n\r\nOn his return to Rome he resumed his old habits, and died in the prime\r\nof life, probably B. C. 47, as that is the latest date to which allusion\r\nis made in his writings.\r\n\r\nHis works consist of numerous short fugitive pieces of a lyrical\r\ncharacter; elegies, such as that already quoted; a secular hymn to\r\nDiana; a poem, somewhat of a dithyrambic character, entitled Atys; and\r\nthe Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis, a mythological poem in heroic\r\nverse. His taste was evidently formed on a study of the Greek poets,\r\nfrom whom he learnt not only his beautiful hendecasyllables, but also\r\ntheir modes of thought and expression. He had skill and taste to adopt\r\nthe materials with which his vast erudition furnished him, and to\r\nconceal his want of originality and inspiration. Some of his pieces are\r\ntranslations from the Greek, as, for example, the elegy on the hair of\r\nBerenice, which is taken from the Greek of Callimachus, and the\r\ncelebrated ode of Sappho.[505] He was one of the most popular of the\r\nRoman poets—firstly, because he possessed those qualities which the\r\nliterary society of Rome most highly valued, namely, polish and\r\nlearning; and secondly, because, although he was an imitator, there is a\r\nliving reality about all that he wrote—a truly Roman nationality. He did\r\nnot merely disguise the inspiration of Greece in a Latin dress, but\r\ninvested Roman life, and thoughts, and social habits with the ideal of\r\nGreek love and beauty. For these reasons his fame flourished as long as\r\nRome possessed a classical literature. Two eminent men only have\r\nwithheld their admiration—Horace in the golden age; Quintilian in the\r\nperiod of the decline. The former disparages him as a lyrical poet; the\r\nlatter almost passes him over in silence. Horace was jealous of a rival\r\nwho was so nearly equal to himself: he could not bear the remotest\r\nchance of his claim being disputed to be the musician of the Roman\r\nlyre;[506] and he dishonestly declared that he first adapted Æolian\r\nstrains to the Roman lyre,[507] notwithstanding the Lesbian character\r\nand hendecasyllabic metres of his predecessor. Quintilian could not\r\nappreciate Catullus, because his own taste was too stiff and affected,\r\nand spoilt by the rhetorical spirit of his age.\r\n\r\nCatullus had a talent for satire, but his satire was not inspired by a\r\nnoble indignation at vice and wrong. It was the bitter resentment of a\r\nvindictive spirit: his love and his hate were both purely selfish. His\r\nlanguage of love expresses the feelings of an impure voluptuary; his\r\nlanguage of scorn those of a disappointed one. He gratified his\r\nirritable temper by attacking Cæsar most offensively; but the noble\r\nRoman would not crush the insect which annoyed him; and although\r\nCatullus insulted him personally by reading his lampoons in his\r\npresence, not a change passed over his countenance: he would not stoop\r\nto avenge himself: and the imperial clemency disarmed the anger of the\r\nlibeller. The strong prejudice of Niebuhr in favour of Roman antiquity\r\nled him to pronounce Catullus a gigantic and extraordinary genius, equal\r\nin every respect to the lyric poets of Greece previously to the time of\r\nSophocles; he believed him to be the greatest poet Rome ever possessed,\r\nexcept, perhaps, some few of the early ones; but that great man also\r\nthought that Virgil had mistaken his vocation in becoming an epic\r\ninstead of a lyric poet.[508] Catullus certainly possessed great\r\nexcellences and talents of the most alluring and captivating kind. No\r\ngenius ever displayed itself under a greater variety of aspects. He has\r\nthe playfulness and the petulance of a girl, the vivacity and simplicity\r\nof a child. He has never been surpassed in gracefulness, melody, and\r\ntenderness. No one, unless he possessed the coolness and self-command of\r\na Cæsar, could have avoided wincing under the sharp attacks of his wit:\r\nhe had passion and vehemence, but he had not the grandeur and sublimity\r\neither of Lucretius or Virgil.\r\n\r\nAlthough the peculiar characteristics of his poetry are chiefly to be\r\nfound in his lyric and elegiac poems, there are in his longer pieces,\r\nwhich are less known and less admired, passages of singular sweetness\r\nand beauty. He had not sufficient grasp and comprehensiveness of mind to\r\nconduct an epic poem. His knowledge of human nature, confined as it was\r\nto one of its phases—the development of the softer affections—did not\r\nadmit of sufficient variety for so vast a work. His intellectual taste,\r\nlike his moral principles, was too ill-regulated to construct a\r\nwell-digested plan, necessary to the perfection of an epic poem; but\r\nwherever ingenuity and liveliness in description, or pathos in moving\r\nthe affections, are required, the poetry of Catullus does not yield to\r\nthat of Ovid or of Virgil.\r\n\r\nThe poem, entitled the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, bears some slight\r\nresemblance to an heroic poem. Its subject is heroic, for it imbodies a\r\nlegend of the heroic age. The characters of mythology play a part in it,\r\nsimilar to that which they support in the poems of Homer or Virgil. But\r\nit is unconnected and deficient in unity; and the plan is far too\r\nextensive for the dimensions by which it is circumscribed. Nevertheless,\r\nwith all these faults, it is pleasing on account of the luxuriance of\r\nits fancy and the brilliancy of its genius. The most beautiful passage,\r\nperhaps, is the episode relating the story of Theseus and Ariadne, which\r\nis introduced into the main body of the poem as being woven and\r\nembroidered on the hangings of the palace of Holeus. The following\r\nverses are taken from this episode,[509] and form part of the complaint\r\nof Ariadne for the perfidious desertion of Theseus:—\r\n\r\n          Siccine discedens, neglecto numine Divûm,\r\n          Immemor ah! devota domum perjuria portas?\r\n          Nullane res potuit crudelis flectere mentis\r\n          Consilium? tibi nulla fuit clementia præsto,\r\n          Immite ut nostri vellet mitescere pectus?\r\n          At non hæc quondam nobis promissa dedisti\r\n          Voce; mihi non hoc miseræ sperare jubebas;\r\n          Sed connubia læta, sed optatos hymenæos;\r\n          Quæ cuncta aërii discerpunt irrita venti.\r\n          Jam jam nulla viro juranti fœmina credat,\r\n          Nulla viri speret sermones esse fideles;\r\n          Qui, dum aliquid cupiens animus prægestit apisci,\r\n          Nil metuunt jurare, nihil promittere parcunt;\r\n          Sed simul ac cupidæ mentis satiata libido est,\r\n          Dicta nihil metuere, nihil perjuria curant.\r\n          Certe ego te in medio versantem turbine leti\r\n          Eripui, et potius germanum amittere crevi,\r\n          Quam tibi fallaci supremo in tempore deessem.\r\n          Pro quo dilaceranda feris dabor, alitibusque\r\n          Præda, neque injecta tumulabor mortua terra.\r\n          Quænam te genuit sola sub rupe leæna?\r\n          Quod mare conceptum spumantibus exspuit undis?\r\n          Quæ Syrtis, quæ Scylla vorax, quæ vasta Charybdis,\r\n          Talia qui reddis pro dulci præmia vitæ?\r\n          Si tibi non cordi fuerant connubia nostra,\r\n          Sæva quod horrebas prisci præcepta parentis;\r\n          Attamen in vestras potuisti ducere sedes,\r\n          Quæ tibi jucundo famularer serva labore,\r\n          Candida permulcens liquidis vestigia lymphis,\r\n          Purpureave tuum consternens veste cubile.\r\n          Sed quid ego ignaris nequicquam conqueror auris,\r\n          Externata malo? quæ nullis sensibus auctæ\r\n          Nec missas audire queunt, nec reddere voces.—132–161.\r\n\r\n          And couldst thou, Theseus, from her native land\r\n          Thy Ariadne bring, then cruel so\r\n          Desert thy victim on a lonely strand?\r\n          And didst thou, perjured, dare to Athens go,\r\n          Nor dread the weight of Heaven’s avenging blow?\r\n          Could naught thy heart with sacred pity touch?\r\n          Naught make thy soul the baleful plot forego\r\n          ’Gainst her that loved thee? Ah! not once were such\r\n        The vows, the hopes, thy smooth professions did avouch!\r\n\r\n          Then all was truth, then did thy honeyed tongue\r\n          Of wedded faith the flattering fable weave.\r\n          All, all unto the winds of heaven are flung!\r\n          Henceforth let never listening maid believe\r\n          Protesting man. When their false hearts conceive\r\n          The selfish wish, to all but pleasure blind,\r\n          No words they spare, no oaths unuttered leave;\r\n          But when possession cloys their pampered mind,\r\n        No care have they for oaths, no words their honour bind.\r\n\r\n          For this, then, I from instant death did cover\r\n          Thy faithless bosom; and for this preferred,\r\n          Even to a brother’s blood, a perjured lover;\r\n          Now to be torn by savage beast and bird,\r\n          With no due form, no decent rite, interred!\r\n          What foaming sea, what savage of the night,\r\n          In murky den thy monstrous birth conferred?\r\n          What whirlpool guides and gave thee to the light,\r\n        The welcome boon of life thus basely to requite?\r\n\r\n          What though thy royal father’s stern command\r\n          The bond of marriage to our lot forbade,\r\n          Oh! safely still into thy native land\r\n          I might have gone thy happy serving maid;\r\n          There gladly washed thy snowy feet or laid\r\n          Upon thy blissful bed the purple vest.\r\n          Ah, vain appeal! upon the winds conveyed,\r\n          The heedless winds, that hear not my behest:\r\n        No words his ear can reach or penetrate his breast!\r\n\r\nThe writers of the Augustan age and their successors paid Catullus what\r\nthey considered the highest compliment, when they called him _learned_.\r\nCriticism referred everything to the Greek standard. The qualities which\r\nthey recognised by this epithet were those which they deemed most\r\nvaluable—more so even than originality and invention—an extensive\r\nacquaintance with the materials of Greek story, an elaborate study of\r\nthe poets taken as models, a scientific appreciation of the cadences and\r\nharmonies of Greek versification. They were grateful for the blessings\r\nwhich they were conscious of having derived from mental cultivation; and\r\nthe highest praise which they could bestow was to confer upon a poet the\r\ntitle of a learned and accomplished man.\r\n\r\nThis period, at which prose reached its zenith, could boast of other\r\npoets, also, besides Lucretius and Catullus, whose merits were\r\nconsiderable although they did not satisfy the fastidious taste of the\r\nAugustan age. There flourished C. Licinius Calvus,[510] C. Helvius\r\nCinna, Valerius Cato, Valgius, Ticida, Furius Bibaculus, and Varro\r\nAtacinus.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was a lively little man,[511] an orator as well as a\r\npoet. His speeches were elaborately modelled after those of the Attic\r\norators; and had his poems displayed the same polish, they might have\r\nsatisfied Horace[512] and his contemporaries, and thus have been\r\npreserved. As it is, the fragments which remain are so brief, that it is\r\nimpossible to say whether his merits were such as to justify Niebuhr in\r\nplacing him amongst the three greatest poets of his age. His poetry\r\nresembled that of Catullus in spirit and morality. It was the\r\nfashionable poetry of the day, and consisted of tender elegy, playful\r\nand sentimental epigram, licentious love-songs, and bitter personality.\r\n\r\nCinna,[513] besides smaller poems, was the author of an epic, entitled\r\nSmyrna; the subject is unknown: but Catullus, who was his intimate\r\nfriend, praises it highly, and Virgil modestly declares that, as\r\ncompared with Varius and Cinna, he himself appears a goose amongst\r\nswans.[514] Valerius Cato was a grammarian as well as a poet. His two\r\nprincipal poems were entitled Lydia and Diana;[515] and a fragmentary\r\npoem, to which the title _Diræ_ or _Curses_[516] has been given, has\r\nbeen generally attributed to him on the grounds that the author pours\r\nforth his woes to a mistress named Lydia. The argument of the piece is\r\nas follows:—The estate of Cato, like that of Virgil, was confiscated and\r\nmade a military colony; and smarting under a sense of wrong, he\r\nimprecates curses on his lost home. Then the theme changes: his heart\r\nsoftens; and in sad accents he bewails his separation from his mistress,\r\nand from all his rural pleasures. This poem was formerly believed to be\r\nthe work of Virgil, but neither the language nor the poetry can be\r\ncompared to those of the Mantuan bard; nor do the sentiments resemble\r\nthe calmness and resignation with which he bears his misfortunes. J.\r\nScaliger, impressed with these considerations, transferred the\r\nauthorship from Virgil to Cato. But there are no sufficient grounds for\r\ndetermining the question.\r\n\r\nRespecting C. Valgius Rufus all is doubt and obscurity. The grammarians\r\nquote from him; Pliny[517] speaks of his learning; Horace[518] refers to\r\nhim as an elegiac poet, and expresses the greatest confidence in his\r\ncritical taste and judgment. Ticida is mentioned by Suetonius as bearing\r\ntestimony to the merits of Valerius Cato. Bibaculus was a bitter\r\nsatirist, who spared not the feelings of his friend Cato when reduced\r\nfrom affluence to poverty;[519] who himself had the vanity to attempt an\r\nepic poem, and by his vulgar taste provoked the severe criticism of\r\nHorace.[520]\r\n\r\nP. Terentius Varro Atacinus was a contemporary of Varro Reatinus; and\r\nfor this reason his works have often been confounded with those of the\r\nlatter. He was born B. C. 82,[521] near the river Atax in Gaul, and\r\nhence he was surnamed Atacinus, in order to distinguish him from his\r\nlearned namesake, who derived his appellation from property which he\r\npossessed at Reati. Very few fragments of his works are extant,[522]\r\nalthough his poetry was of such a character that Virgil deemed some of\r\nhis lines worthy of plagiarizing.[523] His principal work, which is not\r\nspoken of in very high terms by Quintilian,[524] is a translation of the\r\nArgonautica of Apollonius Rhodius. Besides this, he wrote two\r\ngeographical poems, namely, the _Chorographia_ and _Libri Navales_, a\r\nheroic poem entitled _Bellum Sequanicum_, on one of the Gallic campaigns\r\nof J. Cæsar, and also some elegies, epigrams, and saturæ.[525]\r\n\r\nA fragment of the Chorographia is preserved by Meyer,[526] the\r\nconcluding lines of which were evidently imitated by Virgil, and also\r\nthe following severe epigram on Licinius:—\r\n\r\n            Marmoreo Licinus tumulo jacet, at Cato nullo,\r\n              Pompeius parvo; Quis putet esse Deos?\r\n            Saxa premunt Licinum, levat altum fama Catonem,\r\n              Pompeium tituli. Credimus esse Deos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n    AGE OF VIRGIL FAVOURABLE TO POETRY—HIS BIRTH, EDUCATION, HABITS,\r\n  ILLNESS, AND DEATH—HIS POPULARITY AND CHARACTER—HIS MINOR POEMS, THE\r\nCULEX CIRIS MORETUM COPA AND CATALECTA—HIS BUCOLICS—ITALIAN MANNERS NOT\r\n  SUITED TO PASTORAL POETRY—IDYLLS OF THEOCRITUS—CLASSIFICATION OF THE\r\n      BUCOLICS—SUBJECT OF THE POLLIO—HEYNE’S THEORY RESPECTING IT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   P. VIRGILIUS MARO (BORN B. C. 70.)\r\n\r\nThe period at which Virgil flourished was singularly favourable both to\r\nthe development and appreciation of poetical talent of the most polished\r\nand cultivated kind. The indulgent liberality of the imperial court\r\ncherished and fostered genius: the ruin of republican liberty left the\r\nintellect of the age without any other object except refinement;\r\nimagination was not harassed by the cares and realities of life. The\r\nsame causes contributed to limit the range of prose composition,[527]\r\nand therefore the field was left undisputed to Virgil and Horace and\r\ntheir friends; and as the age of Cicero was essentially one in which\r\nprose literature flourished, so that of Augustus was the golden age of\r\npoetry. Of this age, Virgil stands forth pre-eminent amongst his\r\ncontemporaries, as the representative. He exhibited all its\r\ncharacteristics, polish, ingenuity, and skill, and to these he\r\nsuperadded dignity and sublimity. The life of Virgil, commonly prefixed\r\nto his works, professes to be written by Tiberius Claudius Donatus, who\r\nlived in the fifth century. If, as Heyne thought, the groundwork is by\r\nhim, it has been overlaid with fables similar to those found in the\r\nGesta Romanorum, and owing their origin to the inventions of the dark\r\nages. From this biography, stripped of those portions which are clearly\r\nfabulous, and from other sources, the following particulars respecting\r\nhim may be derived:—P. Virgilius Maro was born on the ides (the 15th) of\r\nOctober,[528] B. C. 70, on a small estate belonging to his father, at\r\nAndes (Pietola,) a village of Cisalpine Gaul, situated about three Roman\r\nmiles from Mantua. It has been disputed whether his name was Virgilius\r\nor Vergilius. Most probably both orthographies are correct, as _Diana_,\r\n_Minerva_, _liber_, and other Latin words, were frequently written\r\n_Deana_, _Menerva_, _leber_, &c.[529]\r\n\r\nVirgil was by birth a citizen of Mantua,[530] but not of Rome, for the\r\nfull franchise was not extended to the _Transpadani_ until B. C. 49,\r\nalthough they enjoyed the Jus Latii as early as B. C. 89. The varied\r\nstores of learning contained in the Georgics and Æneid, abundantly prove\r\nthat Virgil received a liberal education. It is said that he acquired\r\nthe rudiments of literature at Cremona, where he remained until he had\r\nassumed the _toga virilis_.[531] This event, if the anonymous life is to\r\nbe depended upon, took place unusually early; for it is there assigned\r\nto the consulships of Pompey the Great and Licinius Crassus,[532] in the\r\nfirst consulship of whom he was born. From Cremona he went to Milan, and\r\nthence to Naples, where he studied Greek literature and philosophy under\r\nthe direction of Parthenius, a native of Bithynia. Muretus asserts that\r\nhe diligently read the history of Thucydides; but his favourite studies\r\nwere medicine and mathematics—an unusual discipline to engage the\r\nattention of the future poet, but one which, by its exactness, tended to\r\nfoster and mature that judgment which distinguishes his poetry. The\r\nphilosophical sect to which he devoted himself was the Epicurean; and\r\nthe unfortunate general, P. Quintilius Varus, to whom he addresses his\r\nsixth Eclogue,[533] studied this system together with him under Syron.\r\n\r\nAfter this, it is probable that he came to Rome, but soon exchanged the\r\nbustle of the capital, for which his bashful disposition and delicate\r\nhealth unfitted him, for the quiet retirement of his hereditary estate.\r\nOf this he was deprived in B. C. 42, with circumstances of great\r\nhardship, when the whole neighbouring district was divided, after the\r\nbattle of Philippi, amongst the victorious legionaries of Octavius and\r\nAntony. The town of Cremona had supported Brutus, and the old republican\r\nparty, and Mantua, together with its surrounding district, suffered in\r\nconsequence of its too close vicinity.[534] Asinius Pollio was at that\r\ntime commander of the forces in Cisalpine Gaul. He was grinding and\r\noppressive in his administration; but being himself an orator, poet, and\r\nhistorian, he patronised literary men. Congenial tastes recommended\r\nVirgil to his notice, and led him to take compassion on the poet’s\r\ndesolate condition. By his advice, Virgil proceeded to Rome with an\r\nintroduction to Mæcenas. Through him he gained access to Octavius, and\r\neither immediately before or after the peace of Brundisium[535] his\r\nlittle farm was restored to him.\r\n\r\nHe now became a prosperous man, was a member of the literary society\r\nwhich graced the table of Mæcenas, and basked in sunshine of court\r\nfavour. Horace, Virgil, Plotius, and Varius, were united by the closest\r\nbonds of friendship with Mæecenas, and accompanied him on that cheerful\r\nexpedition to Brundisium,[536] when he went thither in order to\r\nnegotiate a reconciliation between Octavius and Antony. Henceforth\r\nVirgil’s favourite residence was Naples.[537] Its sunny climate suited\r\nhis pulmonary weakness far better than the low and damp banks of his\r\nnative Mincius (Menzo.) He had, besides, a villa in Sicily, and when at\r\nRome he lived in a pleasant house on the Esquiline, situated near those\r\nof his friends Mæcenas and Horace. It is difficult to say how Virgil\r\nbecame so rich: patrons were liberal in those days, and he doubtless\r\nowed a portion of his affluence to their munificence. The liberality of\r\nMæcenas is well known; and Martial attributes the prosperity of Virgil\r\nto the favour of “the Tuscan knight.”[538] Augustus also had great\r\nwealth at his disposal, and was profuse in the distribution of it\r\namongst his favourites.\r\n\r\nThere is a passage in the Odes of Horace[539] which seems to hint that\r\nhe engaged to a slight extent in mercantile concerns: even if this\r\nformed one source of his wealth, the love of gain (studium lucri,) and\r\nanxiety about the means of living, do not appear to have hindered him\r\nfrom devoting his hours of serious occupation to literary labours and\r\nthe diligent use of his well-stored library, whilst his leisure was\r\ngiven to the delights of social intercourse, for which he was so\r\neminently qualified by his sweet temper and amiable disposition.\r\n\r\nThe poet’s term of life was not extended far beyond fifty years. He had\r\nnever been healthy or robust: he sometimes spat blood, and frequently\r\nsuffered from headache and indigestion.[540] Ill health was the only\r\ndrawback to a life otherwise passed in calm felicity. In the year B. C.\r\n19 he meditated a tour in Greece, intending, during the course of it, to\r\ngive the final polish to his great epic poem. Greece and her classic\r\nscenes, the favourite haunts of the Muses, the time-honoured contests of\r\nOlympia, the living and breathing statues which he beheld in that home\r\nof art, evidently inspired the beautiful imagery which adorns the\r\nintroduction to the third Georgic. He, however, only reached Athens:\r\nthere he met Augustus, who was on his way back from Samos, and both\r\nreturned together. On the occasion of this voyage, Horace wrote that\r\ntender ode[541] in which he affectionately calls him “the half of his\r\nsoul:”—\r\n\r\n                   Navis quæ tibi creditum\r\n                     Debes Virgilium, finibus Atticis\r\n                   Reddas incolumem precor\r\n                     Et serves animæ dimidium meæ.\r\n\r\nOn the way he was seized with a mortal sickness, which was aggravated by\r\nthe motion of the vessel, and he only lived to land at Brundisium. The\r\npowers of nature, already enfeebled, were now totally exhausted, and he\r\nexpired on the 22nd of September. He was buried rather more than a mile\r\nfrom Naples, on the road to Puteoli (Pozzuoli.) A tomb is still pointed\r\nout to the traveller which is said to be that of the poet. Nor is this\r\nimprobable; for, although it is not situated on the present high-road,\r\nit is quite possible that the original direction of the road may have\r\nbeen changed.[542] His epitaph is said to have been dictated by himself\r\nin his last moments:—\r\n\r\n             Mantua me genuit; Calabri rapuere; tenet nunc\r\n               Parthenope. Cecini Pascua, Rura, Duces.[543]\r\n\r\nVirgil was deservedly popular both as a poet and as a man. His rivals in\r\nliterature could not envy one so unassuming and inoffensive his\r\nwell-merited success, but loved him as much as they admired his poetry.\r\nThe emperor esteemed him, the people respected him. “Witness,” says\r\nTacitus,[544] “the letters of Augustus,—witness the conduct of the\r\npeople itself, which, when some of his verses were recited in the\r\ntheatre, rose _en masse_, and showed the same veneration for Virgil, who\r\nhappened to be present among the audience, which they were wont to show\r\nto Augustus.” He was exceedingly temperate in his manner of living; so\r\npure-minded[545] and chaste in the midst of a profligate and licentious\r\nage, that the Neapolitans gave him the name of Parthenias (from\r\nπαρθενος, a virgin,) unselfish, although surrounded by selfishness,\r\nkind-hearted, and sympathizing. His talents and popularity never spoiled\r\nhis natural simplicity and modesty, as his moving in the polite circles\r\nof the capital never could entirely wear off his rustic shyness and\r\nunfashionable appearance.\r\n\r\nHe was constitutionally pensive and melancholy, and so distrustful of\r\nhis own poems, that Augustus could not persuade him to send an\r\nunfinished portion of the Æneid to him for perusal. “As to my Æneas,” he\r\nwrites to the emperor,[546] when absent on his Cantabrian campaign, “if\r\nI had anything worth your reading I would send it with pleasure, but the\r\nwork is only just begun, and I even blame my folly for venturing upon so\r\nvast a task. But you know that I shall apply fresh and increased\r\ndiligence to carrying out my design.” It was with real reluctance that\r\nhe subsequently read the sixth book to the Emperor and Octavia. In his\r\nlast moments he was anxious to burn the whole manuscript; and in his\r\nwill he directed his executors, Varius and Tucca, either to improve it\r\nor commit it to the flames.[547] He was open-hearted and generous, but\r\nnot extravagant in the expenditure of his wealth, for he bequeathed to\r\nhis brother, his friends, and the Emperor, a considerable property.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Virgil’s earliest poetical essay was an epic poem, the\r\nsubject of which was the Roman wars; but that the impossibility of\r\nintroducing Roman names in hexameter verse caused him to desist from the\r\ntask almost as soon as he had commenced it. The minor poems which are\r\nstill extant, were probably his first works. These are the _Culex_,\r\n_Ciris_, _Moretum_, _Copa_, and the shorter pieces in lyric, elegiac,\r\nand iambic metres,[548] commonly known by the name of Catalecta. The\r\n“Culex” (Gnat) is a bucolic poem, with something of a mock-heroic\r\ncolouring, of which the argument is as follows:[549] A shepherd,\r\novercome with the heat, falls asleep beneath the shade of a tree, and a\r\nvenomous serpent from a neighbouring marsh stealthily approaches. A gnat\r\nflies to his rescue, and stings him on the brow. The shepherd, awoke by\r\nthe smart, crushes his rescuer, but sees the serpent and kills it. The\r\nghost of the gnat appears, reproaches him with his ingratitude, and\r\ndescribes the adventures he has met with in the regions of the dead. The\r\nshepherd erects a monument in his honour, and indites the following\r\nepigram:—\r\n\r\n            Parve culex, pecudum custos tibi tale merenti\r\n            Funeris officium vitæ pro munere reddit.\r\n\r\n            Poor insect, thou a shepherd’s life didst save;\r\n            Thou gavest a life, he gives thee but a grave.\r\n\r\nThe “Ciris,” which some have attributed to Corn. Gallus, is the Greek\r\nlegend of Scylla, who was changed into a fish, and her father Nisus into\r\nan eagle. Great use has been made by Spenser of this poem in the\r\nconversation between Britomart and her nurse Glauce, and also in\r\nGlauce’s incantations.[550] The “Moretum,” was intended to trace the\r\nemployments of the agricultural labourer through the day; but it only\r\ndescribes the commencement of them, and the preparation of a dish of\r\n_olla podrida_ of garden herbs called _moretum_. It contains an\r\ningenious description of a cottager’s kitchen garden. The “Copa,” is an\r\nelegiac poem, not unlike in jovial spirit the scolia or drinking songs\r\nof the Greeks: it represents a female waiter at a tavern, begging for\r\ncustom by a tempting display of the accommodations and comforts prepared\r\nfor strangers. It describes the careless enjoyment of rural festivity:\r\nthe simple luxuries of grapes and mulberries, the fragrant roses, the\r\ncheerful grasshoppers, and timid little lizards of Italy. Nor are the\r\nexcitements of the dice, the joys of wine, the blandishments of love\r\nunsung. Dull care is banished far, and the enjoyment of the present hour\r\ninculcated:—\r\n\r\n                     Pereant qui crastina curant\r\n                 Mors aurem vellens Vivite, ait, venio.\r\n\r\nAmongst the lyric poems of Virgil is a very elegant one on the villa of\r\nhis instructor in philosophy, Syron.\r\n\r\nThe poems which first established his reputation were his Bucolics or\r\nEclogues. This latter title was given them in later times, implying\r\neither that they were selections from a greater number of poems or\r\nimitations of passages selected from the works of Greek poets.[551]\r\n\r\nThe characters in Virgil’s Bucolics are Italians, in all their\r\nsentiments and feelings, acting the unreal and assumed part of Sicilian\r\nshepherds. In fact, the Italians never possessed the elements of\r\npastoral life, and therefore could not naturally furnish the poet with\r\noriginals and models from which to draw his portraits and characters.\r\nThey were a simple people, but their simplicity was rather Ascræan than\r\nArcadian: the domestic habits and virtues of rural life in Italy were\r\nnot unlike those of Bœtia, as described by Hesiod. Virgil, therefore,\r\nwisely took him as his model, and produced a more natural picture of\r\nItalian manners in his Georgics than in his Eclogues. The denizens of\r\nthe little towns had the manners and habits of municipal life: their\r\ncultivation was the artificial refinement of town life, and not the\r\nnatural sentiments of the contemplative shepherd. Those who lived in the\r\ncountry were hard-working, simple-minded peasants, who gained their\r\nlivelihood by the sweat of their brow—honest, plain-spoken,\r\nrough-mannered, and without a grain of sentimentality. Pastoral poetry\r\nowes its origin to, and is fostered by, solitude; its most beautiful\r\npassages are of a meditative cast. The shepherd beguiles his loneliness\r\nby communing with his own thoughts. His sorrows are not the hard\r\nstruggles of life, but often self-created and imaginary, or at least\r\nexaggerated. When represented as Virgil represents them in his Bucolics,\r\nthey are in masquerade, and the drama in which they form the characters\r\nis of an allegorical kind. The connexion with Italy is rather of an\r\nhistorical than a moral nature: we meet with numerous allusions to\r\ncontemporary events, but not with exact descriptions of Italian\r\ncharacters and manners. As, therefore, we cannot realize the\r\ndescriptions, we can neither sympathize nor admire. Menalcas and Corydon\r\nand Alexis, and the rest, are as much out of place as the gentlemen and\r\nladies in the garb of shepherds and shepherdesses in English family\r\npictures. Even the scenery is Sicilian, and does not truthfully describe\r\nthe tame neighbourhood of Mantua. So long as it is remembered that they\r\nare imitations of the Syracusan poet, we miss their nationality, and see\r\nat once that they are untruthful and out of keeping; and Virgil suffers\r\nin our estimation because we naturally compare him with the original\r\nwhom he professes to imitate, and we cannot but be aware of his\r\ninferiority: but if we can once divest ourselves of the idea of the\r\noutward form which he has chosen to adopt, and forget the personality of\r\nthe characters, we can feel for the wretched outcast, exiled from a\r\nhappy though humble home, and be touched by the simple narrative of\r\ntheir disappointed loves and child-like woes; can appreciate the\r\ndelicately-veiled compliments paid by the poet to his patron; can enjoy\r\nthe inventive genius and poetical power which they display; and can be\r\nelevated by the exalted sentiments which they sometimes breathe. We feel\r\nthat it is all an illusion; but we willingly permit ourselves to be\r\ntransported from the matter-of-fact realities of a hard and prosaic\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nVirgil in his Eclogues was too much cramped by following his Greek\r\noriginal to present us with true pictures of Italian country life;\r\nalthough the criticism of his friend Horace with justice attributes to\r\nhis rural pieces delicacy of touch and graceful wit:—\r\n\r\n                 molle atque facetum\r\n             Virgilio annuerunt gaudentes rure Camœnæ.[552]\r\n\r\nThe Idylls of Theocritus are transfusions into appropriate Greek of old\r\npopular Sicilian legends which had taken root in the country, and had\r\nbecome part and parcel of the national character. His subjects are not\r\nalways strictly pastoral, for his characters are sometimes reapers and\r\nfishermen.[553] His language, characters, sentiments, scenery, habits,\r\nincidents, are all Sicilian, and therefore all are in perfect harmony.\r\nThe characters of Theocritus have a specific individuality, and are\r\ntherefore different from each other; those of Virgil are generic, the\r\nrepresentatives of a class, and therefore there is little or no variety.\r\nBut still Virgil’s defects do not detract much from the enjoyment\r\nexperienced in reading his Bucolic poetry. The Aminta of Tasso, the\r\nPastor Fido of Guarini, the Calendar of Spenser, the Lycidas of Milton,\r\nthe Perdita of Shakspeare, the pastorals of Drayton, Drummond, and\r\nFlorian, are equally open to objection, and yet who does not admire\r\ntheir beauties?\r\n\r\nThe Bucolics may be arranged in two classes. Those in the first are\r\ncomposed entirely after the Greek model, and contain the following\r\npoems:—\r\n\r\nI. The first, in which the poet, representing himself under the\r\ncharacter of Tityrus, expresses his gratitude for the restoration of his\r\nproperty, whilst Melibœus, as an exiled Mantuan, bewails his harder\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nII. The second, which is generally supposed to have been the first\r\npastoral written by him, and is principally copied from the Cyclops of\r\nTheocritus.\r\n\r\nIII. The third is an imitation of the fourth and fifth Idylls of\r\nTheocritus, and as well as the seventh, represent improvisatorial trials\r\nof musical skill between shepherds.\r\n\r\nV. The fifth, in which two shepherds pay the last honours to a departed\r\nfriend, the one singing his epitaph, the other his apotheosis.\r\nScaliger[554] has with good reason supposed that this poem allegorized\r\nthe murder and deification of Julius Cæsar. It has been often imitated\r\nby modern poets: the most beautiful imitations are Spenser’s lament for\r\nDido, Milton’s Lycidas, Drayton’s sixth Eclogue, and Pomfret’s Elegy on\r\nQueen Mary.\r\n\r\nVIII. The eighth, which is imitated from the second and third Idylls of\r\nTheocritus, consists of two parts; and, from the subject-matter of the\r\nsecond portion, is entitled “Pharmaceutria,” (the Enchantress.) Two\r\nshepherds, Damon and Alphesibœus, rival Orpheus in their musical skill,\r\nfor, whilst they sing, heifers forget to graze, lynxes are stupified,\r\nand rivers stop their course to listen. It was addressed by Virgil to\r\nhis kind patron Pollio, whilst employed in his expedition to\r\nIllyricum.[555] Damon, personifying an unsuccessful lover, laments that\r\na rival has been preferred to himself. Alphesibœus, in the character of\r\nan enchantress, goes through a formula of magical incantations in order\r\nto regain the lost affections of Daphnis. In this poem a refrain, or\r\nintercalary verse, recurs after intervals of a few lines. In the song of\r\nDamon, the refrain is—\r\n\r\n               Incipe Mænalios mecum, mea tibia, versus.\r\n\r\nIn that of his opponent—\r\n\r\n           Ducite ab urbe domum, mea carmina, ducite Daphnim.\r\n\r\nIX. In the ninth, two shepherds converse together on the troubles which\r\nhave befallen their neighbourhood, and one of them is represented as\r\nconveying a present of a few kids to court the favour of the new\r\npossessor.\r\n\r\nThe second class are of a more original kind.\r\n\r\nIV. The fourth, entitled Pollio, which is the most celebrated of them\r\nall, bears no resemblance to pastoral poetry. In the exordium, the poet\r\ninvokes the Muses of Sicilian song; but he professes to attune their\r\nsylvan strain to a nobler theme. The melancholy Perusian war had been\r\nbrought to a termination. The reconciliation of Anthony and Octavius had\r\nbeen effected by the treaty of Brundisium, and all things seemed to\r\npromise peace and prosperity. The contrast was indeed a bright one,\r\nafter the havoc and desolation which war had spread through Italy. The\r\npeace ratified with Sextus Pompey at Puteoli opened the long-closed\r\ngranaries of Sicily, and plenty succeeded to famine. The enthusiasm of\r\nthe poet hailed the return of the fabled golden age—the reign of Saturn.\r\nThe songs which the old bards of Italy professed to have learnt from the\r\nCumæan Sibyl, and to which legendary tradition attributed a prophetical\r\nmeaning, seemed to point to the new era which now dawned on the Roman\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nThe belief of the civilized world was undoubtedly at this time\r\nconcentrated on the expectation of some great event, which should bring\r\npeace and happiness to mankind. The divine revelation which God’s people\r\nenjoyed taught them now to expect the advent of the Messiah; whilst\r\ntraditions, probably derived through corrupting channels from the true\r\nlight of prophecy, taught the heathen, though more vaguely, to look for\r\nthe coming of some great one. The prophetic literature of the East might\r\nhave travelled to Europe; and the divine prophecies of Isaiah, and the\r\nother sacred writers, may have been incorporated by native bards in\r\nItalian legends.\r\n\r\nBishop Lowth even supposed that the Sibylline predictions derived their\r\norigin from a Greek version of Messianic prophecies.[556] A belief in\r\nthe inspiration of the Sibyls prevailed in the early ages of\r\nChristianity, and the Emperor Constantine in one of his orations[557]\r\nquotes from them, and paraphrases Virgil’s Pollio as an evidence to the\r\ntruths of the Gospel.\r\n\r\nSome of the fathers of the Church attributed to them supernatural power;\r\nand the Italian painters, acting under the patronage of the Roman\r\nChurch, honoured the four Sibyls as participators in a knowledge of the\r\nDivine counsels. Ambrose[558] allows that they were inspired, but by the\r\nspirit of evil. Jerome[559] believes that this power was given to them\r\nby God as a reward for virginity; and Augustine[560] thinks that they\r\npredicted many truths concerning Jesus Christ. Justin[561] adopts a\r\nlegend which would account for the similarity between the Sibylline\r\noracles and Hebrew prophecy. He says that the Cumæan Sibyl, celebrated\r\nby Virgil, was born at Babylon, and was the daughter of Berosus, the\r\nChaldean historian.\r\n\r\nIf Virgil, in the fourth eclogue, correctly paraphrased the Sibylline\r\npoems, two parallelisms between them and the prophecies of Isaiah are\r\nremarkably striking:[562]—\r\n\r\n            Jam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;\r\n            Jam nova progenies cœlo demittitur alto—\r\n            Te duce, si qua manent sceleris vestigia nostri,\r\n            Irrita perpetua solvent formidine terras—\r\n            Pacatumque reget patriis virtutibus orbem.—v. 6.\r\n\r\n  Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son.—Is. vii. 14.\r\n\r\n  Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end,\r\n  upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to\r\n  establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for\r\n  ever.—Is. ix. 7.\r\n\r\n           At tibi prima, puer, nullo munuscula cultu,\r\n           Errantes hederas passim cum baccare tellus,\r\n           Mixtaque ridenti colocasia fundet acantho.—v. 18.\r\n\r\n  The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the\r\n  desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.—Is. xxxv. 1.\r\n\r\nMany theories have been proposed respecting the child to whom allusion\r\nis made in this eclogue, not one of which was satisfactory to\r\nGibbon;[563] but the following is adopted by Heyne as the most probable.\r\nThe peace of Brundisium was cemented by the marriage between Antony and\r\nCæsar’s half-sister Octavia. She was the widow of Marcellus, and\r\nappeared likely to give birth to a posthumous child. To this child yet\r\nunborn, the poet applies all the blessings promised by the Sibylline\r\noracles, and predicts that, under his auspices, the peace and prosperity\r\nalready inaugurated shall be confirmed.\r\n\r\nVI. In the sixth, Virgil represents allegorically, under the character\r\nof Silenus the tutor of Bacchus, his own instructor Syron; and thus\r\nmakes it the vehicle of a short account of the Epicurean philosophy. It\r\nwas not long since the same subject had been treated of at greater\r\nlength by the eloquent Lucretius; and it is said that when Cicero heard\r\nit recited by the mime Cytheris, he was so struck with admiration as to\r\nexclaim that he was “Magnæ spes altera Romæ.” This eclogue is parodied\r\nby Gay in the Saturday of his Shepherd’s Week.\r\n\r\nX. The tenth can scarcely be distinguished from any other amatory poem,\r\nexcept that the heroic metre is not so usual in that species of poetry\r\nas the elegiac. The loves of the poet Gallus are sung; Arcadia is fixed\r\nupon as the place of his exile; and the lay is said to be set to the\r\nmusic of the oaten-pipe of Sicily: but this eclogue has no other claim\r\nto be entitled a bucolic poem.\r\n\r\nOne passage in this eclogue, which suggested the following beautiful\r\nlines in Milton’s “Lycidas,” illustrates the truth that poetry often\r\nderives additional beauty from the fact of its being a successful\r\nimitation:—\r\n\r\n     Quæ nemora aut qui vos saltus habuere, puellæ\r\n     Naiades, indigno cum Gallus amore periret?\r\n     Nam neque Parnassi vobis juga nam neque Pindi\r\n     Ulla moram fecere, neque Aonia Aganippe.\r\n                                                      _Ecl._ x. 9.\r\n\r\n     Where were ye, Nymphs, when the remorseless deep\r\n     Closed o’er the head of your loved Lycidas?\r\n     For neither were ye playing on the steep,\r\n     Where your old bards, the famous Druids, lie,\r\n     Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,\r\n     Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream.\r\n                                               _Milton’s Lycidas._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\nBEAUTY OF DIDACTIC POETRY—ELABORATE FINISH OF THE GEORGICS—ROMAN LOVE OF\r\n RURAL PURSUITS—HESIOD SUITABLE AS A MODEL—CONDITION OF ITALY—SUBJECTS\r\n TREATED OF IN THE GEORGICS—SOME STRIKING PASSAGES ENUMERATED—INFLUENCE\r\n OF ROMAN LITERATURE ON ENGLISH POETRY—SOURCES FROM WHICH THE INCIDENTS\r\n   OF THE ÆNEID ARE DERIVED—CHARACTER OF ÆNEAS—CRITICISM OF NIEBUHR.\r\n\r\n\r\nDidactic poetry is of all kinds the least inviting. As its professed\r\nobject is instruction, there is no reason why its lessons should be\r\nconveyed in poetical language—its purpose, could in fact, be better\r\nattained in prose. Pretending, therefore, to poetry, it demands great\r\nskill, elaborate finish and such graces and embellishments as will\r\nconceal its dry character, and recommend it to the reader’s attention.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of a didactic poem depends only partially on the just views\r\nand correct discrimination which it evinces, and principally on the\r\nbeauty of the language, the picturesque force, and pleasing character of\r\nthe descriptions, and the interest that is thrown into the episodes. In\r\nfact, the accessaries are the parts most admired, and extracts brought\r\nforward as specimens of this kind of poetry are invariably of this kind.\r\nPoetry naturally deals with the beauties and terrors of external\r\nnature—with the emotions and passions, whether of a tender or violent\r\nkind—the sober practical rules of life are scarcely within its sphere.\r\nTrue it is that when all literature was poetical, the precepts of moral\r\nand physical philosophy, and even the dry commands of laws and\r\ninstitutions, were embodied in a metrical form; but when literature\r\ndivides itself into poetry and prose, the subjects appropriated to each\r\nother become spontaneously separate likewise. For this reason, the\r\nGeorgics of Virgil especially display his ability as a poet, his correct\r\ntaste the “limæ labor,” the pains which he took in polishing and\r\ncorrecting. In none of his poems can we form a better idea of the\r\ndescription which he gives of his patient toil, when he says, that “like\r\nthe she-bear he brought his poetical offspring into shape by constantly\r\nlicking them.”[564] The majesty of the language elevates the subject,\r\nand divests it of so much of the homeliness as would be inappropriate to\r\npoetry, and yet at the same time it is not too grand or elevated.\r\n\r\nThe following criticism of Addison[565] is by no means too\r\nfavourable:—“I shall conclude this poem to be the most complete,\r\nelaborate, and finished piece of all antiquity. The Æneis is of a nobler\r\nkind; but the Georgic is more perfect in its kind. The Æneis has a\r\ngreater variety of beauties in it; but those of the Georgic are more\r\nexquisite. In short, the Georgic has all the perfection that can be\r\nexpected in a poem written by the greatest poet, in the flower of his\r\nage, when his invention was ready, his imagination warm, his judgment\r\nsettled, and all his faculties in their full vigour and maturity.”\r\n\r\nRome offered a favourable field for a poet to undertake a poem on the\r\nlabours and enjoyments of rural life. Agriculture was always there\r\nconsidered a liberal employment: tradition had adorned rustic manners\r\nwith the attributes of simplicity and honesty, and divested them of the\r\nideas of coarseness usually connected with them. The traditions of those\r\nages of national freedom and greatness, to which the enthusiasm of the\r\npoet delighted to carry back the thoughts of his readers, had connected\r\nsome of the noblest names of history with rural labours. Curius and\r\nCincinnatus were called from the plough to defend and save their\r\ncountry; and after their task was performed they returned with delight\r\nto it again. Cato, the representative of the old and respected\r\ngeneration, and other illustrious men, had written on the pursuits and\r\nduties of rural life. Agriculture was never connected with ideas of\r\ndebasing and illiberal gain, such as attached to trade and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe poet, moreover, had a model ready at hand, after which to construct\r\nhis work. It was Greek, and therefore sure to be acceptable upon the\r\nrecognised principles of taste. It described a species of rural life,\r\nhard, frugal, and industrious, very much like that led by the\r\nagriculturists of Italy. It painted a standard of morals, which even the\r\nlicentious inhabitants of a luxurious capital could appreciate, though\r\nthey had degenerated from it. The discriminating judgment of Virgil saw\r\nthat the rural life of Italy could really be represented, in the same\r\nway in which Hesiod had painted that of Bœtia, and he wisely determined—\r\n\r\n              To sing through Roman towns Ascræan strains.\r\n\r\nThere exists, however, precisely that difference between the Georgics of\r\nVirgil and their model that might be expected. The Hesiodic poem belongs\r\nto a period when poetry was the accidental form—instruction the\r\nessential object; and, therefore, the teaching is systematic, precise,\r\ndetailed, homely, sometimes coarse and unpolished. Virgil looks at his\r\nsubject from the poetical point of view. His precepts are often put, not\r\nin a didactic but a descriptive form; they are unhesitatingly\r\ninterrupted by digressions and episodes, more or less to the point; and\r\nout of a vast mass of materials such only are selected as are suitable\r\nto awaken the sensibilities.\r\n\r\nThe state of Italy also contributed to enlist a poet’s sympathies in\r\nfavour of the rural classes, and to devote his pen to the patriotic task\r\nof reviving the old agricultural tastes. War had devastated the land;\r\nthe peasant population had been fearfully thinned by military\r\nconscriptions and confiscation; wide districts had been depopulated and\r\nleft destitute of cultivation. Instead of the sword being beat into a\r\nploughshare and the spear into a pruning-hook, the Italian peasant had\r\nwitnessed the contrary state of things. The poet laments the sad change\r\nwhich now disfigured the fair face of Italy:—\r\n\r\n                             non ullus aratro\r\n     Dignus honos, squalent abductis arva colonis,\r\n     Et curvæ rigidum falces conflantur in ensem.\r\n                                                    _Geo._ i. 507.\r\n\r\nThe credit of having proposed this subject to Virgil is given to his\r\npatron Mæcenas; and, to him, consequently, the Georgics are addressed;\r\nbut the poet doubtless gladly adopted the suggestion. When and where it\r\nwas commenced is uncertain, but the finishing stroke was put to it at\r\nNaples[566] some time after the battle of Actium.[567] Although the\r\n“Works and Days” of Hesiod is professedly his pattern, still he derives\r\nhis materials from other sources. Aratus supplies him with his signs of\r\nthe weather, and the writers _de Re Rustica_ with his practical\r\ndirections. His system is indeed perfectly Italian; so much so, that\r\nmany of his rules may be traced in modern Italian husbandry, just as the\r\ndescriptions of implements in Hesiod are frequently found to agree with\r\nthose in use in modern Greece.\r\n\r\nThe first book treats of tillage, the second of orchards; the subject of\r\nthe third, which is the noblest and most spirited of them, is the care\r\nof horses and cattle; and the fourth, which is the most pleasing and\r\ninteresting, describes the natural instincts as well as the management\r\nof bees.\r\n\r\nBut the great merit of the Georgics consists in their varied\r\ndigressions, interesting episodes, and sublime bursts of descriptive\r\nvigour, which are interspersed throughout the poem. To quote any of them\r\nwould be unnecessary, as Virgil and his translations are in every one’s\r\nhands. It will be sufficient to enumerate some of the most striking.\r\nThese are—\r\n\r\n      I. The Origin of Agriculture, G. I. 125.\r\n\r\n     II. The Storm in Harvest, I. 316.\r\n\r\n    III. The Signs of the Weather, I. 351.\r\n\r\n     IV. The Prodigies at the Death of Julius Cæsar, I. 466.\r\n\r\n      V. The Battle of Pharsalia, I. 489.\r\n\r\n     VI. The Panegyric on Italy, II. 136.\r\n\r\n    VII. The Praises of a Country Life, II. 458.\r\n\r\n   VIII. The Horse and Chariot Race, III. 103.\r\n\r\n     IX. The Description of Winter in Scythia, III. 349.\r\n\r\n      X. The Murrain of Cattle, III. 478.\r\n\r\n     XI. The Battle of the Bees, IV. 67.\r\n\r\n    XII. The Story of Aristæus, IV. 317.\r\n\r\n   XIII. The Legend of Orpheus and Eurydice, IV. 453.\r\n\r\nRoman poetry was more generally understood and more diligently studied\r\nin the most polished days of English literature, than the yet scarcely\r\ndiscovered stores of Greek learning. Want of originality was not\r\nconsidered a blemish in an age the taste of which, notwithstanding all\r\nits merits, was very artificial; whilst the exquisite polish and\r\nelegance which constitute the charm of Latin poetry, recommended it both\r\nfor admiration and imitation. Hence English poets have been deeply\r\nindebted to the Romans for their most happy thoughts, and our native\r\nliterature is largely imbued with a Virgilian and Horatian spirit. This\r\ncircumstance adds an especial interest to a survey of Roman literature\r\nas the fountain from which welled forth so many of the streams that have\r\nfertilized our poetry.\r\n\r\nThe Georgics have been frequently taken as a model for imitation, and\r\nour descriptive poets have drawn largely from this source. Warton[568]\r\nconsidered Philips’ “Cyder” the happiest imitation; “The Seasons” of our\r\ngreatest descriptive poet, Thomson, is a thoroughly Virgilian poem. Many\r\nstriking instances of Virgilian taste might be adduced, especially the\r\nthunder-storm in “Summer,” and the praises of Great Britain, in\r\n“Autumn.”\r\n\r\nFrom the letter already quoted as preserved by Macrobius, it is clear\r\nthat the Æneid was commenced when Augustus was in Spain,[569] that it\r\noccupied the whole of Virgil’s subsequent life, and was not sufficiently\r\ncorrected to satisfy his own fastidious taste when he died. Augustus\r\nintrusted its publication to Varius and Tucca, with strict instructions\r\nto abstain from interpolation. They are said to have transposed the\r\nsecond and third books, and to have omitted twenty-two lines[570] as\r\nbeing contradictory to another passage respecting Helen in the sixth\r\nbook.[571] Hence in many early manuscripts these verses are wanting.\r\n\r\nThe idea and plan of the Æneid are derived from the Homeric poems. As\r\nthe wrath of Achilles is the mainspring of all the events in the Iliad,\r\nso on the anger of the offended Juno the unity of the Æneid depends, and\r\nwith it all the incidents are connected. Many of the most splendid\r\npassages, picturesque images, and forcible epithets are imitations or\r\neven translations from the Iliad and Odyssey. The war with Turnus owes\r\nits grandeur and its interest to the Iliad—the wanderings of Æneas,\r\ntheir wild and romantic adventures to the Odyssey. Virgil’s battles,\r\nthough not to be compared in point of vigour with those of Homer, shine\r\nwith a reflected light. His Necyia is a copy of that in the Odyssey. His\r\nsimiles are most of them suggested by those favourite embellishments of\r\nHomer. The shield of Æneas[572] is an imitation of that of Achilles. The\r\nstorm and the speech of Æneas[573] are almost translations from the\r\nOdyssey.[574]\r\n\r\nThe thoughts thus borrowed from the great heroic poems of Greece, Virgil\r\ninterwove with that ingenuity which distinguishes the Augustan school by\r\nmeans of the double character in which he represented his hero. The\r\nnarrative of his perils by sea and land were enriched by the marvellous\r\nincidents of the Odyssey; his wars which occupy the latter books had\r\ntheir prototype in the Iliad. Greek tragedy, also, which depicted so\r\nfrequently the subsequent fortunes of the Greek chieftains,[575]—the\r\nnumerous translations which had employed the genius of Ennius, Attius,\r\nand Pacuvius—were a rich mine of poetic wealth. The second book, which\r\nis almost too crowded with a rapid succession of pathetic incidents,\r\nderived its interesting details—the untimely fate of Astyanax, the loss\r\nof Creusa, the story of Sinon, the legend of the wooden horse, the death\r\nof the aged Priam, the subsequent fortunes of Helen—from two Cyclic\r\npoems, the Sack of Troy and the little Iliad of Arctinus. For the legend\r\nof Laocoon he was indebted to the Alexandrian poet, Euphorion. The class\r\nof Cyclic poems entitled the νοστοι suggested much of the third book,\r\nespecially the stories of Pyrrhus, Helenus, and Andromache. The fourth\r\ndrew its fairy enchantments partly from Homer’s Calypso, partly from the\r\nlove adventures of Jason, Medea, and Hypsypile in the Argonautica of the\r\nAlexandrian poet, Apollonius Rhodius, which had been introduced to the\r\nRomans by the translation of Varro.\r\n\r\nThe sixth is suggested by the eleventh book of the Odyssey and the\r\ndescent of Theseus in search of Pirithous in the Hesiodic poems. But\r\nnotwithstanding the force and originality—the vivid word-painting which\r\nadorns this book—it is far inferior to the conceptions which Greek\r\ngenius formed of the unseen world. In the Æneid the legends of the world\r\nof spirits seem but vulgar marvels and popular illusions. Tartarus and\r\nElysium are too palpable and material to be believed; their distinctness\r\ndispels the enchantment which they were intended to produce; it is\r\ndaylight instead of dim shadow. We miss the outlines, which seem\r\ngigantic from their dim and shadowy nature, the appalling grandeur to\r\nwhich no one since Æschylus ever attained, except the great Italian poet\r\nwho has never since been equalled.\r\n\r\nTo this rich store of Greek learning Italy contributed her native\r\nlegends. The adventures of Æneas in Italy—the prophecy, of which the\r\nfulfilment was discovered by Iulus—the pregnant white sow—the story of\r\nthe Sibyl—the sylph-like Camilla—were native lays amalgamated with the\r\nGreek legend of Troy. Macrobius,[576] in three elaborate chapters, has\r\nshown that Virgil was deeply indebted to the old Latin poets. In the\r\nfirst he quotes more than seventy parallel turns of expression from\r\nEnnius, Pacuvius, Attius, Nævius, Lucilius, Lucretius, Catullus, and\r\nVarius, consisting of whole or half lines. In the second he enumerates\r\ntwenty-six longer passages, which Virgil has imitated from the poems of\r\nEnnius, Attius, Lucretius, and Varius, amongst which are portions of\r\n“The Praises of Rural Life,” and of “The Pestilence.”[577] In the third\r\nhe mentions a few (amongst them, for example, the well-known description\r\nof the horse[578]) which were taken by Virgil from the old Roman poets,\r\nhaving been first adopted by them from the Homeric poems. The following\r\npassages are a few of these examples of what would in modern times be\r\nconsidered plagiarisms, but which the ancients admitted without\r\nreluctance:—\r\n\r\n     Qui cœlum versat stellis fulgentibus aptum.\r\n                                                         _Ennius._\r\n\r\n     Axem humero torquet stellis fulgentibus aptum.\r\n                                                 _V.

What sweeter specimens can be found of\r\ntender pathos than the legend of Camilla, and the episode of Nisus and\r\nEuryalus? Where is the turbulence of uncurbed passions united with\r\nwomanly unselfish fondness, and queen-like generosity, painted with a\r\nmore masterly hand than in the character of Dido? Where, even in the\r\nIliad, are characters better sustained and more happily contrasted than\r\nthe weak Latinus, the soldier-like Turnus, the simple-minded Evander,\r\nthe feminine and retiring Lavinia, the barbarian Mezentius, who to the\r\nsavageness of a wild beast joined the natural instinct, which warmed\r\nwith the strongest affection for his son. The only character of which\r\nthe conception is somewhat unsatisfactory is that of the hero himself:\r\nÆneas, notwithstanding his many virtues, fails of commanding the\r\nreader’s sympathy or admiration. He is full of faith in the providence\r\nof God, submits himself with entire resignation to His divine will—is\r\nbrave, patient, dutiful—but he is cold and heartless, and, if the\r\nexpression is allowable, unchivalrous. In his war with Turnus, he is so\r\ndecidedly in the wrong, and the character of his injured adversary\r\nshines with such lustre, and is adorned with such gallantry, that one is\r\ninclined to transfer to him the interest and sympathy which ought to be\r\nfelt for the hero alone. This is undoubtedly a fault, but it is\r\ncounterbalanced by innumerable excellences.\r\n\r\nIn personification, nothing is finer than Virgil’s portraiture of Fame,\r\nexcept perhaps Spenser’s Despair. In description, the same genius which\r\nshone forth in the Georgics, embellishes the Æneid also; and both the\r\nobjects and the phenomena of nature are represented in language equally\r\nvivid and striking.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the question has been much discussed, it is most\r\nprobable that the opinion of Pope was correct respecting the political\r\nobject of the Æneid. He affirmed that it was as much a party-piece as\r\nDryden’s Absalom and Achitophel; that its primary object was to increase\r\nthe popularity of Augustus; its secondary one to flatter the vanity of\r\nhis countrymen by the splendour and antiquity of their origin. Augustus\r\nis evidently typified under the character of Æneas: both were cautious\r\nand wise in council,[579] both were free from the perturbations of\r\npassion; they were cold, unfeeling, and uninteresting. Their wisdom and\r\ntheir policy were calculating and worldly-minded. Augustus was\r\nconscious, as his last words show, that he was acting a part; and the\r\ncontrast between the sentiments and conduct of Æneas, wherever the warm\r\nimpulses of affection might be supposed to have sway, likewise create an\r\nimpression of insincerity. The characteristic virtue which adorns the\r\nhero of the Æneid, as the epithet “Pius” so constantly applied to him\r\nimplies, was filial piety; and there was no virtue which Augustus more\r\nostentatiously put forward than dutiful affection to Julius Cæsar who\r\nhad adopted him.\r\n\r\nOther characters which are grouped around the central figure are\r\nallegorical likewise—Cleopatra is boldly sketched as Dido, the\r\npassionate victim of unrequited love. Both displayed the noble, generous\r\nqualities, and at the same time the uncontrolled self-will of a woman,\r\nwho neither had nor would acknowledge any master except the object of\r\nher affections: the fortunes of both were similar, for their brothers\r\nhad become their bitterest enemies, and the fate of both alike was\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\nTurnus, whose character, as has been already stated, is far more\r\nchivalrous and attractive than that of Æneas, probably represented the\r\npopular Antony; and as the latter violated the peace ratified at\r\nBrundisium and Tarentum, so the former is represented as treacherous to\r\nhis engagements with Æneas. It has even been thought, and the view has\r\nbeen supported by many ingenious arguments, that Iapis is a portrait of\r\nthe physician of Augustus.[580]\r\n\r\nVirgil is especially skilful in that species of imitation which consists\r\nin the appropriate choice of words, and the assimilation of the sound to\r\nthe sense. A series of dactyles expresses the rapid speed of horses, and\r\nthe still more rapid flight of time:—\r\n\r\n     Quadrupedante putrem Sonitu quatit ungula campum.\r\n                                                  _Æn._ viii. 591.\r\n\r\n     Sed fugit interea fugit irreparabile tempus.\r\n                                                  _Geo._ iii. 284.\r\n\r\nDignity and majesty are represented by an unusual use of spondees:—\r\n\r\n     —— quæ Divum incedo regina.\r\n                                                      _Æn._ i. 50.\r\n\r\n     —— penatibus et magnis Dîs.\r\n                                                  _Æn._ viii. 679.\r\n\r\nAccelerated motion by a corresponding change of metre:—\r\n\r\n        —— jamjam lapsura cadentique\r\n     Imminet assimilis——\r\n                                                    _Æn._ vi. 602.\r\n\r\nEffort by a hiatus:—\r\n\r\n                 Ter sunt conati imponere Pelio Ossam.\r\n\r\nAbruptness, or the fall of a heavy body, by a monosyllable:—\r\n\r\n     Insequitur cumulo præruptus aquæ mons.\r\n                                                     _Æn._ i. 109.\r\n\r\n     —— procumbit humi bos.\r\n                                                     _Æn._ v. 481.\r\n\r\nMany other examples might be adduced[581] of that which, if it were an\r\nartifice, would be a very pleasing one, which rather proceeds from the\r\nnatural impulses of a lively fancy and a delicately-attuned ear.\r\n\r\nDunlop has well observed, that Virgil’s descriptions are more like\r\nlandscape-painting than any by his predecessors, whether Greek or Roman,\r\nand that it is a remarkable fact that landscape-painting was first\r\nintroduced in his time. Pliny, in his Natural History,[582] informs us\r\nthat Ludius, who flourished in the lifetime of Augustus, invented the\r\nmost delightful style of painting, compositions introducing porticoes,\r\ngardens, groves, hills, fish-ponds, rivers, and other pleasing objects,\r\nenlivened by carriages, animals, and figures. Thus, perhaps, art\r\ninspired poetry.\r\n\r\nNo one has ever attempted to disparage the reputation of Virgil as\r\nholding the highest rank amongst Roman poets, except the Emperor\r\nCaligula, J. Markland, and the great historian Niebuhr. The latter does\r\nnot hesitate to say that the flourishing period of Roman poetry ceased\r\nabout the time of the deaths of Cæsar and Cicero.[583] Doubtless Roman\r\nnational poetry then ceased, and was succeeded by the new era of Greek\r\ntaste; but still the poems of the new school were equally majestic and\r\npathetic, and though less natural, owed to their Greek originals\r\nincomparably greater polish, grace and sweetness.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand the low opinion which Niebuhr entertained\r\nof Virgil, and the superiority which he attributes to Catullus. He not\r\nonly declares that he is opposed to the adoration with which the later\r\nRomans regarded him, but he denies his fertility of genius and inventive\r\npowers. Although he acknowledges that the Æneid contains many exquisite\r\npassages, he pronounces it a complete failure, an unhappy idea from\r\nbeginning to end. It is evident that he looked at the Æneid with the eye\r\nof an historian, and that his objections to it were entirely of an\r\nhistorical character.\r\n\r\nWrapped up in Roman nationality and Italian traditions, he did not\r\nforgive Virgil for adulterating this pure source of antiquarian\r\ninformation with Greek legends. He assumes, correctly enough, that an\r\nepic poem, in order to be successful, must be a living narrative of\r\nevents known and interesting to the mass of a nation, and at the same\r\ntime confesses that, whilst the ancient Italian traditions had already\r\nfallen into oblivion, Homer was at that time better known than Nævius.\r\nSurely, then, if Virgil had drawn from Italian sources exclusively, he\r\nwould have omitted much that would have added interest to his poem in\r\nthe opinion of his hearers, and would not have complied with the epic\r\nconditions which Niebuhr himself lays down. Besides, if the traditions\r\nof Nævius were Italian, were not many of the Greek and Italian\r\ntraditions which form the framework of the Æneid identical? Nævius must\r\nhave drawn largely from the Cyclic poems; and Niebuhr allows that Virgil\r\ncopied these parts of his poem from Nævius.[584] He asserts his\r\nconviction that Virgil’s shield of Æneas had its model in Nævius, in\r\nwhose poem Æneas or some other hero had a shield representing the wars\r\nof the giants; and yet no one could doubt that the shield of Nævius must\r\nhave been suggested by the Homeric and Hesiodic poems. Servius also\r\nbelieved that Virgil borrowed from the poem of Nævius the plan of the\r\nearly books of the Æneid.[585]\r\n\r\nSome of Virgil’s minor poems are undoubtedly very beautiful;[586] but it\r\nis absurd to say that even the greatest elegance in fugitive pieces of\r\nsuch a stamp can outshine the noble and sublime passages interwoven\r\nthroughout the whole structure of the Æneid. The dispraise of Niebuhr is\r\nas exaggerated as the fulsome compliment paid by Propertius to the\r\ngenius of his fellow-countryman:—\r\n\r\n     Cedite, Romani scriptores, cedite Graii,\r\n       Nescio quid majus nascitur Iliade.\r\n                                                   _Eleg._ ii. 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n    THE LIBERTINI—ROMAN FEELINGS AS TO COMMERCE—BIRTH AND INFANCY OF\r\n  HORACE—HIS EARLY EDUCATION AT ROME—HIS MILITARY CAREER—HE RETURNS TO\r\n ROME—IS INTRODUCED TO MÆCENAS—COMMENCES THE SATIRES—MÆCENAS GIVES HIM\r\n      HIS SABINE FARM—HIS COUNTRY LIFE—THE EPODES—EPISTLES—CARMEN\r\n                      SECULARE—ILLNESS AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   HORATIUS FLACCUS (BORN B. C. 65.)\r\n\r\nLyric poetry is the most subjective of all poetry, and the musician of\r\nthe Roman lyre[587] was the most subjective of all Latin poets: hence a\r\ncomplete sketch of his life and delineation of his character may be\r\ndeduced from his works. They contain the elements of an autobiography;\r\nand, whilst they constitute the most authentic source of information,\r\nconvey the particulars in the most lively and engaging form.\r\n\r\nAt the period of Horace’s birth the _Libertini_, or freedmen, were\r\nrapidly rising in wealth, and, therefore, in position. The Roman\r\nconstitution excluded the senatorial order from commercial pursuits, and\r\nwould not even permit them to own vessels of any considerable burden,\r\nlest they should be made use of in trade. The old Roman feeling was even\r\nmore exclusive than the law. There were certain trades in which not only\r\nnone who had any pretensions to the rank of a gentleman, but even no one\r\nwho was free-born could engage without degradation. Cicero[588]\r\nconsiders that money-lending, manufactures, retail trade, especially in\r\ndelicacies which minister to the appetite, are all sordid and illiberal.\r\nHe does not even allow that the professions of medicine and architecture\r\nare honourable, except to such as are of suitable rank. Agriculture is\r\nthe only method of money-making which he pronounces to be without any\r\ndoubt worthy of free-born men.\r\n\r\nDevoted to the duties of public life either as soldiers or citizens, the\r\nRomans did not comprehend the dignity of labour. High-minded and\r\nunselfish as it may appear to think meanly of employments undertaken\r\nsimply for the sake of profit and lucre, the political result of this\r\npride was unmixed evil. Commerce was thus thrown into the hands of those\r\nwhose fathers had been slaves, and who themselves inherited and\r\npossessed the usual vices of a slavish disposition.\r\n\r\nThe middle classes were impoverished, and, as the unavoidable\r\nconsequence of a system in which social position depended upon property,\r\nwere rapidly sinking into the lowest ranks of the population. Here then\r\nwas a gap to be filled up—the question was by what means? Had Roman\r\nfeeling permitted the free-born citizen to devote his energies to labour\r\nand the creation of capital, he would have risen in the social scale,\r\nwould have occupied the place left vacant, and would have brought with\r\nhim those sentiments of chivalrous freedom which there can be no doubt\r\ndistinguished Rome in earlier times, and advanced her in the scale of\r\nnations. Thus the circulation would have been complete and healthy, and\r\nthe national system would have received fresh life and vigour in its\r\nmost important part. Instead of this, however, slaves and the sons of\r\nslaves rose to wealth: not such slaves as those who, well educated and\r\noccupying a high or, at least, a respectable position in the conquered\r\nGreek states, were appreciated by their conquerors, became their friends\r\nand intimates, because of their worth and intellectual acquirements,\r\nimbued their masters with their own refinement and taste, and were\r\nintrusted with the education of their children, but slaves who had\r\nformed the masses of degraded nations. These were driven in hordes to\r\nRome. They swarmed in all the states of Italy and Sicily. Many of them\r\nwere not deficient in ability and energy, and therefore they rose; but\r\nthey had little or no moral principle. Their children intermarried with\r\nthe lower classes of the citizens; their blood infected that of the\r\nhigher European races which flowed in their veins; and thus the masses\r\nof Rome became a mixed race, but not mixed for the better. The character\r\nchanged; but it changed because the old race had perished, and a new\r\nrace with new characteristics occupied its place.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, the _Libertini_ became a powerful and\r\nimportant class, both socially and politically: they were the bankers,\r\nmerchants, and tradesmen of Rome.\r\n\r\nOf this class, the father of Horace was one of the most respectable. His\r\nbusiness was that of a _coactor_, or agent who collected the money from\r\npurchasers of goods at public auctions. He was a man of strict\r\nintegrity, content with his position, and would not have thought himself\r\ndisgraced if his son had followed his own calling.[589] He had made by\r\nhis industry a small fortune, sufficient to purchase an estate near\r\nVenusia (Venosa,) on the confines of Lucania and Apulia, but not\r\nsufficient to free him from the appellation of “a poor man.”[590]\r\n\r\nHere, on the 8th of December (vi^to id. Decembr.,) B. C. 65, Q. Horatius\r\nFlaccus was born; and on the banks of the obstreperous Aufidus,[591] the\r\nroar of whose waters could be heard far off,[592] Horace passed his\r\ninfant years, and played and wandered in that picturesque neighbourhood.\r\nThe natural beauties amidst which he was nursed, probably did much to\r\nform and foster his poetic tastes. He himself relates, in one of his\r\nfinest odes,[593] an adventure which befell him in his childhood, and\r\nwhich reminds the reader of the beautiful nursery ballad of the Children\r\nin the Wood:——\r\n\r\n  Me fabulosæ Vulture in Appulo\r\n  Altricis extra limen Apuliæ\r\n    Ludo fatigatumque somno\r\n      Fronde nova puerum palumbes\r\n\r\n  Texere (mirum quod foret omnibus,\r\n  Quicumque celsæ nidum Acherontiæ,\r\n    Saltusque Bantinos, et arvum\r\n      Pingue tenent humilis Ferenti,)\r\n\r\n  Ut tuto ab atris corpore viperis\r\n  Dormirem et ursis; ut premerer sacra\r\n    Lauroque collataque myrto\r\n      Non sine Dîs animosus infans.\r\n\r\n    Fatigued with sleep and youthful toil of play,\r\n    When on a mountain’s brow reclined I lay,\r\n    Near to my natal soil, around my head\r\n  The fabled woodland doves a verdant foliage spread;\r\n\r\n    Matter, be sure, of wonder most profound\r\n    To all the gazing habitants around,\r\n    Who dwell in Acherontia’s airy glades,\r\n  Amid the Bantian woods, or low Ferentum’s meads.\r\n\r\n    By snakes of poison black and beasts of prey,\r\n    That thus in dewy sleep unharmed I lay;\r\n    Laurels and myrtle were around me piled,\r\n  Not without guardian gods, an animated child.\r\n                                                           _Francis._\r\n\r\nHe remained amongst his native mountains until his eleventh or twelfth\r\nyear, when his father, wisely wishing to secure for him the benefits of\r\na liberal education, which the neighbouring village school of Flavius\r\ndid not furnish, removed with him to Rome.[594] Thus he quitted Venusia\r\nfor ever, of which place many passages in his works prove that he\r\nretained very vivid recollections.[595]\r\n\r\nAt Rome he was placed under the instruction of Orbilius Pupillus, a\r\ngrammarian, who had been formerly in the army, and had migrated from\r\nBeneventum to the capital. He was celebrated as a schoolmaster, but\r\nstill more for his severity, for he was commonly called the flogging\r\nOrbilius (Plagosus Orbilius.[596]) With him young Horace read in his own\r\nlanguage the poems of Livius Andronicus and Ennius; and in the Greek,\r\nthe Iliad of Homer, whose divine poetry he soon learnt to enjoy.[597]\r\n\r\nWhilst his father took this care of his intellectual education, he\r\nenabled him by dress and a retinue of slaves to associate on terms of\r\nequality with boys far above him in rank and station;[598] and, what was\r\nstill more important, he kept him under his own roof, and thus secured\r\nfor his son the benefits of home influences, sage and prudent advice,\r\nand the watchful care of the parental eye.[599] For his father’s\r\nliberality, good example, and constant attention, Horace expresses the\r\ndeepest gratitude,[600] and to him he acknowledges himself indebted for\r\nall the good points of his character. The practical nature of this\r\nindulgent and devoted father’s instruction—how he delighted to teach by\r\nexample rather than by precept—is simply told by Horace himself[601] in\r\none of his satires.\r\n\r\nBefore he arrived at man’s estate, it is probable that he lost his wise\r\nadviser, for he never mentions his father except in connexion with the\r\nyears of his boyhood. Perhaps this is the reason why, in his earlier\r\npoetry, his genial freedom so often degenerated into licentiousness, and\r\nhis love of pleasure tempted him to adopt the dissolute manners of a\r\ncorrupt age. His moral sense was accurate and just—he could see what was\r\nuseful and approve it; he could censure the vices of his\r\ncontemporaries—but he had lost that wise counsel which had hitherto\r\npreserved him pure.\r\n\r\nAthens was at that period the university of Rome. Thither the Roman\r\nyouth resorted to learn language, art, science, and philosophy:—\r\n\r\n                Inter sylvas Academi quærere verum.[602]\r\n\r\n                To seek for truth in Academic groves.\r\n\r\nHorace commenced his residence there at a great political crisis, and\r\nthe politics of Rome created a vivid interest in the young students at\r\nAthens. He had not lived there long, when Julius Cæsar was assassinated;\r\nand many of his fellow students, as was natural to youthful and ardent\r\nminds, zealously embraced the republican party. Horace, now twenty-two\r\nyears of age, joined the army of Brutus, and served under him until the\r\nbattle of Philippi in the rank of a military tribune.[603] He must have\r\nalready become distinguished, since nothing but merit could have\r\nrecommended the son of a freedman to Brutus for so high a military\r\ncommand. But the event proved that he had sadly mistaken his vocation,\r\nfor he was totally unfit for the position either of an officer or a\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nWith the rest of the vanquished he fled from the field of Philippi; and\r\nin a beautiful and affectionate ode[604] to Pompeius Varus, he confesses\r\nthat he even threw away his shield; nor was he one of those who rallied,\r\nalthough his friend was carried back again into the bloody conflict of\r\nthe tide of war. So at any rate he himself tells the story. It may have\r\nbeen, however, that his vanity prompted him to pretend a resemblance in\r\nthis respect to his favourite Alcæus, or perhaps he wished to address a\r\npiece of courtly flattery to the conqueror. Varus was one of his\r\nearliest friends: together they had spent days of study and of\r\nfestivity; and when troublous times had separated them, nothing can\r\nexceed the wild and tumultuous joy with which Horace looks forward to a\r\nreunion with his friend.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Rome he found that his father was dead, and his\r\npatrimony confiscated.[605] In order to obtain a livelihood, he\r\npurchased a clerk’s place under the quæstor.[606] For its duties he must\r\nhave been totally unfit, for he hated business[607] and loved pleasure\r\nand literary ease. But on the income of this office, and the kindness of\r\nhis friends, he lived a life of frugality and poverty.[608] It is\r\npossible that even then he gained some profit from his poems, for he\r\nsays,[609] “Audacious poverty drove me to write verses.” Perhaps when he\r\nbecame more prosperous, he resigned his place, for he does not mention\r\nit in the account he gives to Mæcenas of the usual, daily avocations of\r\nhis careless and sauntering life.[610]\r\n\r\nSoon, however, his fortunes began to brighten. His talents recommended\r\nhim, when about twenty-four years of age, to Virgil and Varius.[611]\r\nThey were then the leading poets at Rome; and Mæcenas, the polished but\r\nsomewhat effeminate friend of Augustus, was the powerful patron of\r\ngenius and the head of literary society. These two poets were warmly\r\nattached to Horace, whose affection for them was equally strong,[612]\r\nand to them he owed his introduction to the favourite of the\r\nemperor.[613] He felt rather timid at the interview: Mæcenas spoke to\r\nhim with his usual reserved and curt manner, took no notice of him for\r\nnine months, and then sent for him and enrolled him in the number of his\r\nfriends. Thenceforth Horace enjoyed uninterruptedly his friendship and\r\nintimacy—of the affectionate nature of which many evidences may be found\r\nin those poetical pieces which Horace addressed to him.\r\n\r\nAs Mæcenas rose in influence and favour with Augustus, he also procured\r\nthe advancement of his friend. When he was sent by Augustus on the\r\ndelicate mission of effecting a reconciliation with Anthony, Horace\r\naccompanied him;[614] and it is not impossible that his shipwreck off\r\nCape Palinurus occurred when he was sailing with Mæcenas on his\r\nexpedition against S. Pompey.\r\n\r\nAt this period of his life he commenced the composition of his first\r\nbook of Satires.[615] The knowledge of human life which he had begun to\r\nacquire when he lived, as it were, upon the town, and became acquainted\r\nwith the manners, habits and modes of thinking of the masses, was\r\nafterwards cultivated, refined and matured by intercourse with the best\r\nliterary society. His observant mind found ample materials for satire at\r\nthe table of the courtly Mæcenas, and amidst the brilliant circle by\r\nwhich he was surrounded. In this, his first publication, he also\r\nintroduces himself to the reader’s notice, draws a lively picture of his\r\nyouth, and describes the life which was congenial to his tastes, and\r\nwhich his change of circumstances permitted him to lead.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be supposed that he wrote nothing at that time except\r\nsatire. Some of his odes, which display the strength of youthful\r\npassions and the loosest morality, were probably written as separate\r\nfugitive pieces, and circulated privately amongst his friends. The ode\r\nto Canidia narrates a circumstance in the early part of his poetical\r\ncareer. The Epodes breathe the spirit of the satirist rather than of the\r\nlyric poet; and therefore the coarsest of them[616] also may belong to\r\nthe same period,[617] although the book which bears that name was not\r\ncompleted and published as a whole until some years subsequently.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of some of the Epodes is more suitable to his years of\r\nadversity, and the hard struggles by which the temper is soured, than to\r\nthat life of ease and comfort which patronage enabled him to lead. Then\r\nhis temper resumed its wonted placidity, whilst his moral taste was\r\nrefined; his Archilochian iambics became less cutting, and his ideas\r\nless gross; personal invective was laid aside, and his indignation was\r\nonly aroused by the prospect of political troubles and the horrors of\r\ncivil commotions.\r\n\r\nMæcenas accompanied his friendship with substantial favours. He gave\r\nhim, or procured for him by his influence, the public grant of his\r\nSabine farm. It was situated in a beautiful valley near Digentia\r\n(Licenza.) Being about fifteen miles from Tibur (Tivoli,) it was\r\nsufficiently near the capital to suit the fickle poet, who, when there,\r\noften regretted the luxury, and gossip, and brilliant society of Rome,\r\nand, when at Rome, sighed for the frugal table, the quiet retirement,\r\nthe rural employment of his country abode. The rapid alternation of town\r\nand country life, which the possession of this estate enabled Horace to\r\nenjoy, gives a peculiar charm to his poetry. The scene is ever changing:\r\nhis mind reflects the tenor of his life; simple pictures of rural life,\r\nand the elegant refinements of polished society, relieve one another,\r\nand prevent dulness and satiety. The property was neither extensive nor\r\nfertile, but it was sufficient for his moderate wants and wishes, which\r\nare so beautifully expressed in his sixth Satire—a poem which has found\r\nmany modern imitators.\r\n\r\nAt Rome, Horace occupied a house on the pleasant and healthful heights\r\nof the Esquiline. Here he resided during the winter and spring, with the\r\nexception of occasional sojourns at Baiæ, or other places of fashionable\r\nresort, on the southern coast of Italy. Summer and autumn he passed at\r\nhis Sabine farm, where he was a great favourite with his simple\r\nneighbours, and where he found all that he ever wished for, and even\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n                     Modus agri non ita magnus,\r\n             Hortus ubi, et tecto vicinus jugis aquæ fons,\r\n             Et paulum silvæ super his.[618]\r\n\r\nHe coveted not his neighbour’s field,[619] even though it disfigured his\r\nown. He never prayed that chance might throw in his way a buried vase of\r\nsilver.[620] The calm of his life contrasted favourably with the hundred\r\naffairs—not so much his own as of other people—which tormented him at\r\nRome;[621] the importunities of his friends that he would use his\r\ninfluence in their behalf with Mæcenas;[622] the growing envy to which\r\nhis good fortune subjected him:[623] his only cares were to store up\r\nprovisions for his frugal maintenance during the year,[624] so that he\r\nmight live in sweet forgetfulness of how he lived.[625] His days were\r\ndivided between the books of the ancients,[626] the philosophy of Plato,\r\nand the lively scenes of Menander.[627]\r\n\r\nThe pleasing labours of the farm served him by way of exercise, although\r\nhis town habits and awkwardness, and perhaps his short and stout figure,\r\npanting and perspiring under the heat and exertion, sometimes provoked\r\ngood-humoured laughter.[628] At times, although he confessed how\r\ndangerous was the siren voice of sloth, he would spend hours of musing\r\nidleness on the margin of his favourite stream, listening to its\r\nmurmurs, and to the music of the shepherd’s reed as it echoed through\r\nthe Arcadian glen.[629] The evenings were devoted to social converse\r\nwith honest and virtuous friends, from which scandal and gossip were\r\nbanished; the conversation usually turning on moral and philosophical\r\ndiscussion,[630] whilst its seriousness was occasionally relieved by\r\nwitty anecdotes and pointed fables, of which those of the town and\r\ncountry mice, and of the madman who, when cured, complained that his\r\nfriends had destroyed all the happiness of his dreamy life, furnish\r\nexamples. At these _petits soupers_, which he called “suppers of the\r\ngods,” the guests drank as much or as little as they pleased of his old\r\nwine, and enjoyed perfect freedom from the absurd laws which Roman\r\ncustom permitted the chairman (_arbiter bibendi_) on such occasions to\r\nimpose.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when the heat of summer was intense, he retired to the lofty\r\nPræneste (Palestrina,) where the climate was always cool and\r\nrefreshing.[631] At some period of his life, also, he became possessed\r\nof a villa at Tibur (Tivoli,) of which the shady groves and roaring\r\nwaterfalls furnished him a delightful refreshment after “the smoke, and\r\nmagnificence, and noise of Rome.” Here he wrote many of his satires, and\r\nthus achieved the reputation as a satirist of which he had laid the\r\nfoundation already; and was enabled to boast that, though earnestly\r\ndesirous of peace with the world, it were better not to provoke him;\r\nthat he who dared to offend him should smart for it, and be the\r\nlaughing-stock of the whole city.[632]\r\n\r\nThe composition and arrangement of the second book of Satires probably\r\noccupied the thirtieth, thirty-first, and thirty-second years of the\r\npoet’s life,[633] and it was not published until the following year.\r\nThis date will allow time for the expiration of more than seven or eight\r\nyears since his intimacy with Mæcenas commenced.[634] The Satires were\r\nfollowed by the publication of the Epodes, very soon after the battle of\r\nActium,[635] for the ninth is evidently an epinician ode on the occasion\r\nof that victory. Many of them contain noble sentiments, patriotic\r\nadvice, burning indignation against the oriental self-indulgence of\r\nAntony,[636] the servility of Rome, its civil strife, and the degeneracy\r\nof the age; and remind us that, before Horace became an Epicurean and a\r\ncourtier, he had fought against a tyrant in the ranks of freedom.[637]\r\nThe first Epode was written just before the battle of Actium; the second\r\nand third at the period when he first exchanged the life of a\r\nfashionable man about town for that of a country gentleman. We see in\r\none the delight which he derived from the consciousness that his estate\r\nwas his own; that he had no pecuniary embarrassments any longer; his\r\nanticipations of the happiness to be enjoyed in the regularly-recurring\r\nlabours of rural life; in the absence of all care; in the kind-hearted\r\nanticipations of humble domestic felicity; the superiority of a\r\nhealthful meal to all the luxuries that wealth could purchase. In the\r\nother, notwithstanding all these professions of sentiment, he shows that\r\nhis refined urbanity is shocked by the grossness of rural habits. His\r\ndelicate nose cannot endure the smell of garlic: to him it is nothing\r\nless than poison, such as Canidia or Medea might have used. It is more\r\ndeadly than the malaria of Apulia, or the envenomed robe steeped in the\r\nblood of Nessus. Nay, in the same spirit Johnson said that “He who would\r\nmake a pun would pick a pocket,” he does not scruple to affirm that a\r\ngarlic-eater would commit parricide.\r\n\r\nThe seventh Epode is a burst of indignant expostulation against the\r\nfratricidal madness which, at the bidding of an unprincipled woman,\r\narmed Romans against each other in that tragical episode, the Perugian\r\nwar, when the first struggle took place between the civilians and the\r\nsoldiers for political influence and power. In the Epodes the spirit is\r\nthat of the satirist exaggerated. The outward form which he had modelled\r\nby a careful study of the Archilochian verse, prepared him for the\r\ncultivation of that poetry in which he stands pre-eminent. It was the\r\nstate of transition through which he passed before he became a lyric\r\npoet.\r\n\r\nWith their publication concludes the first period of Horace’s literary\r\nlife. It was now flowing on calmly and peaceably, undisturbed by anxiety\r\neither about himself or his country. Although the civil wars were not\r\nyet ended, or the peace of the world solemnly and finally proclaimed,\r\nuntil the temple of Janus was closed,[638] the course of Octavius to\r\nuniversal empire lay plain and open before him. Rome was at his feet,\r\nand owed to him its safety and prosperity.\r\n\r\nPublic and private well-doing developed a new phase of Horace’s genius.\r\nHis muse soared to heights which had only been attempted by Pindar and\r\nthe other Greek lyric poets. It cannot, of course, be supposed that he\r\nlived to the age of thirty-five years without having written many of\r\nthose odes, which are so full of a youthful sprightliness and burning\r\npassion; but it is certain that many more were written, and the first\r\nthree books published, during the period of eight years included between\r\nhis thirty-fifth and forty-second years;[639] some when he was\r\napproaching, others when he had passed, his eighth lustre. In these\r\nthree books it is probable that Horace intended all the products of his\r\nlyric muse should be comprised: to this purpose the last ode of the\r\nthird book[640] seems to point. He considered his work done; and he was\r\nnot insensible to the successful manner in which he had accomplished it.\r\nWith conscious pride, and in a prophetic spirit, he exclaimed—\r\n\r\n                    Exegi monumentum ære perennius.\r\n\r\nHe intended his beloved friend and patron, Mæcenas, to be the subject of\r\nhis last, as he was of his first, song. His introductory satire—the\r\ncommencement of his published works—was addressed to him; the last ode\r\nin the book[641] (except that final one which proclaims his task\r\nfinished) is a noble farewell, breathing the language of affectionate\r\ncompliment;[642] and in the introduction to his new work, the labour of\r\nhis maturer years, the fruit of careful judgment respecting men and\r\nthings, he states his determination to finish his career as a poet, and\r\nto devote his last verses to his patron.\r\n\r\nA few years after the first three books of the Odes, Horace published\r\nthe first book of the Epistles. Bentley assigns the appearance of these\r\nfinished and elaborate compositions to B. C. 19, Clinton to B. C. 20.\r\nThe _Carmen Seculare_, which appeared B. C. 17, on the occasion of the\r\ncelebration of the Secular Games, and the fourth book of the Odes, which\r\nwas published B. C. 13, were written at the personal request of the\r\nEmperor. He wished him to celebrate the victories gained over Vindelici\r\nby his step-sons, Tiberius and Drusus. His compliance with the wishes of\r\nAugustus was a graceful return for the regard and affection which the\r\nletters of the Emperor show that he felt for the poet.[643] The warm\r\nadmiration which, these odes express, the praises which are lavished in\r\nthem, upon Augustus and his step-sons Tiberius and Drusus, may seem\r\ninconsistent with the poet’s former republicanism; but who could\r\nwithstand the proffered friendship, the winning courtesy, the\r\ngood-tempered condescension of his patron?\r\n\r\nBesides, the experience of the past years must have forced him\r\nconscientiously to believe that the reign of Augustus was indeed a\r\nblessing to his country, and that his countrymen were totally unfit for\r\nreal liberty, as they showed themselves quite content with the empty\r\nshadow of the constitution. He felt peace and repose were to be\r\npurchased by almost any sacrifice except that of honourable principle;\r\nthat not only all the enjoyments of life were secured to himself to an\r\nextent equalling, if not surpassing, the wishes of his contented spirit,\r\nbut that a similar measure of happiness was pretty generally diffused.\r\nHe could not sympathize with political ambition, which had been the\r\nfruitful source of civil anarchy, and it was only the ambitious who had\r\nany cause to be dissatisfied. Doubtless the older he grew the stronger\r\nwas the obligation which he felt to him who, by the lofty position which\r\nhe had attained, had apparently prevented even the possibility of\r\nrevolution or change. It is certain that the second book of the\r\nEpistles, and that addressed to the Pisos, which is commonly called the\r\nArt of Poetry, were written and published during the last years of his\r\nlife; but the date cannot be exactly determined. He had long bid adieu\r\nto the excitements of politics; nor do these, his latest works, exhibit\r\ntraces of his fondness for discussing questions of moral science, or for\r\nthe profounder speculations of natural philosophy. He limits himself to\r\nthe neutral ground of literature; and writes only as a writer whose\r\njudgment would be undisputed, because his works in their several\r\ndepartments had actually formed the taste of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nIn November, B. C. 8, A. U. C. 746, Horace was seized with a sudden\r\nattack of illness, and died in the fifty-seventh year of his age. His\r\nold friend Mæcenas had expired but a few months before. They were buried\r\nnear one another on the slope of the Esquiline.\r\n\r\nHis death was so sudden that he was unable to write a will; he had but\r\njust time before he expired to nominate, according to a common custom,\r\nthe Emperor his heir.\r\n\r\nHorace was never married; he was too general an admirer, and his tastes\r\nand habits were too much those of a bachelor, to appreciate the\r\nhappiness of a wedded life. In this respect his feelings resembled those\r\nof the voluptuous and selfish society of his times. He was of small and\r\nslight figure,[644] but afterwards he grew corpulent.[645] The vigour\r\nwhich he enjoyed in early youth[646] was diminished by ill health; he\r\nbecame prematurely gray,[647] and a passage in one of his Odes seems to\r\nimply that he was a valetudinarian at forty.[648]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\nCHARACTER OF HORACE—DESCRIPTIONS OF HIS VILLA AT TIVOLI, AND HIS SABINE\r\nFARM—SITE OF THE BANDUSIAN FOUNTAIN—THE NEIGHBOURING SCENERY—SUBJECTS OF\r\n    HIS SATIRES AND EPISTLES—BEAUTY OF HIS ODES—IMITATIONS OF GREEK\r\n             POETS—SPURIOUS ODES—CHRONOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life of Horace is especially instructive, as a mirror in which is\r\nreflected a faithful image of the manners of his day. He is the\r\nrepresentative of Roman refined society, as Virgil is of the national\r\nmind. He who understands Horace and his works can picture to himself the\r\nsociety in which he lived and moved. One cannot sympathize with\r\nPetrarch, when he says “Se ex nullo poeta Latino evasisse meliorem quam\r\nex Horatio,” or exclaim with the devoted Mæcenas,\r\n\r\n                    Ni te visceribus meis Horati\r\n                    Plus jam diligo, tu tuum sodalem\r\n                    Ninnio videas strigosiorem—\r\n\r\nbut still it is scarcely possible not to feel an affection for him.\r\nNotwithstanding his selfish Epicureanism, he possessed those elements of\r\ncharacter which constitute the popularity of men of the world. He was a\r\ngentleman in taste and sentiments. He would not have denied himself any\r\ngratification for the sake of others; but he would not willingly have\r\ncaused any one a moment’s uneasiness, nor was he ever ungrateful to\r\nthose who were kind to him. He was a pleasant friend and a good-humoured\r\nassociate, adroit in using the language of compliment, but not a\r\nflatterer, because he was candid and sincere. He changed his politics,\r\nbut he had good cause for so doing. The circumstances of the times\r\nfurnished ample justification. His morals were lax, but not worse than\r\nthose of his contemporaries: all that can be said is, that he was not in\r\nadvance of his age. His principles will not bear comparison with a high\r\nmoral standard; but he had good qualities to compensate for his moral\r\ndeficiencies. He looked at virtue and vice from a worldly, not a moral\r\npoint of view. With him the former was prudence, the latter folly. Vice,\r\ntherefore, provoked a sneer of derision, and not indignation at the sin\r\nor compassion for the sinner; and for the same reason he was incapable\r\nof entertaining a holy enthusiasm for virtue.\r\n\r\nGood-tempered as a man, he nevertheless showed that he belonged to the\r\n_genus irritabile vatum_. He was jealous of his poetical reputation;\r\nnot, indeed, towards his contemporaries, but towards the poets of former\r\nages. He either could not or would not see any merit in old Roman\r\npoetry. His prejudice cannot be ascribed only to his enthusiasm for\r\nGreek literature, for he did not even appreciate the excellences which\r\nthe old school of poetry had in common with the Greeks. Party spirit had\r\nsomewhat to do with it, for a feud on the subject divided the literary\r\nsociety of the day,[649] and hence Horace took his side warmly and\r\nuncompromisingly.\r\n\r\nBut the principal cause was jealousy—unless he ignored Lucilius and\r\nCatullus, he could not claim to have been the first follower of\r\nArchilochus of whom Rome could boast; or, as the representative of Roman\r\nlyric poetry, to have first tuned his lyre to Æolian song.\r\n\r\nThe scenes in which Horace passed his life are so interesting to every\r\nreader of his works, that a few words respecting his villa at Tivoli and\r\nhis Sabine farm will not be out of place here. Tibur[650] is situated on\r\none of the spurs of the Appennines, about fifteen or sixteen miles from\r\nRome, on the left bank of the Anio (Teverone.) The river winds gently by\r\nthe town, separating it from the villa of Horace, and then, falling in a\r\nsheet of water over an escarped rock, disappears beneath a rocky cavern.\r\nIts roaring echoes are heard far and wide, and justifies the epithet\r\n(_resonans_,) which Horace gives to the dwelling of Albunea, the\r\nTiburtine Sibyl. The villa commanded fine views, and a garden sloped\r\ndown from it to the river’s bank. From its grounds was visible the\r\npalace of Mæcenas: on the opposite shore the wooded Sabine hills\r\nsheltered it from the north; and the domain of the poet’s friend,\r\nQuintilius Varus, formed its western boundary.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen miles north-east of Tibur, nestling amongst the roots of\r\nMount Lucretilis, lay the Sabine farm. Fragments of white marble, and\r\nmosaic, which have been found there, show that, notwithstanding the\r\nsimple frugality which Horace delights to describe, it was built and\r\nembellished with elegance and taste. From the mountain side, which rises\r\nbehind the house, trickles a clear stream, the source of which is now\r\ncalled Fonte Bello, and which afterwards becomes the river Digentia\r\n(Licenza,) and waters the beautiful valley of the sloping Ustica\r\n(_Usticæ Cubantis_.) This rill, the parent of Horace’s favourite river,\r\nthe embellisher of that “_riant_ angle of the earth,” is interesting as\r\nbeing probably the fountain of Bandusia, “more transparent than\r\nglass,”[651] with whose fresh and sparkling waters the poet tempered his\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nM. de Chaupy[652] assumes that the Bandusian fountain, mentioned by\r\nHorace, was situated near the birthplace of Horace, on the\r\nLucano-Apulian border. His opinion rests on the words of a grant made by\r\nPope Pascal II. to the abbot of the Bantine monastery; and Mr.\r\nHobhouse[653] considers this document as decisive in ascertaining its\r\nposition. It is decisive as to the existence of a Bandusian fountain\r\nnear Venusia; but it must be remembered that Horace never saw it after\r\nthe days of his childhood, when his paternal estate passed away from him\r\nfor ever, whilst he speaks of his Bandusian fountain as near him, when\r\nhe writes, and promises to sacrifice a kid to the guardian genius of the\r\nspring. What, then, is more probable than the suggestion of Mr.\r\nDunlop,[654] that the same pleasing recollections of his early years,\r\nwhich inspired him to relate his touching adventure, led him to “name\r\nthe clearest and loveliest stream of his Sabine retreat after that\r\nfountain which lay in Apulia, and on the brink of which he had no doubt\r\noften sported in infancy?”[655] He has in one of his odes alluded to\r\nthis affectionate desire to perpetuate reminiscences of home—a desire\r\nwhich is illustrated by the topographical nomenclature which has been\r\nadopted by colonists of every age and country.\r\n\r\nMr. Dennis, however, in a letter written at Licenza,[656] in sight of\r\nthe pleasant shades of M. Lucretilis, although he makes no doubt of the\r\nBandusian fountain being in the neighbourhood, does not identify it with\r\nthe “Fonte Bello.” He asserts that, although he has traced every\r\nstreamlet in the neighbourhood, the only one which answers to the\r\nclassical description is one now called “Fonte Blandusia.” It rises in a\r\nnarrow glen which divides the Mount Lucretilis from Ustica, which\r\nprobably derives its modern name _Valle Rustica_ from a corruption of\r\nthe classical appellation. As you ascend the glen it contracts into a\r\nravine with bare cliffs on either side; the streamlet with difficulty\r\nwinds its way between mossy rocks (_musco circumlita saxa_,)\r\novershadowed with dense woods which effectually exclude the heat of the\r\nblazing Dog-star. The water issues from a rock, and trickles into two\r\nsuccessive natural basins. “The water is indeed _splendidior vitro_;\r\nnothing, not even the Thracian Hebrus, can exceed it in purity,\r\ncoolness, and sweetness: ‘its loquacious waters still bubble;’ the very\r\nilices still overhang the hollow rocks whence it springs.”\r\n\r\nA reference to Horace’s description[657] will prove to the modern\r\ntraveller through this classic region with what fidelity and accuracy\r\nthe poet has described the natural features of the scenery. The mountain\r\nchain is continuous and unbroken (_continui montes_,) save by the well\r\nwooded and therefore shady valley of the Digentia, which intersects it\r\nin such a direction that—\r\n\r\n                    Veniens dextrum latus aspiciat sol,\r\n                Lævum decedens curru fugiente vaporet.\r\n\r\nAnother valley meets it, and on an exposed height, at the point of\r\njunction, stands Bardela, in Horace’s time Mandela, and well described\r\nby him as _rugosus frigore pagus_.[658] Corn grows on the sunny field\r\n(apricum pratum) which slopes from the farm to the river: the ruins of\r\nother dwellings mark the spot occupied by five domestic hearths, and\r\nsending five honest representatives to the municipal council of the\r\nneighbourhood:—\r\n\r\n                —— habitatum quinque focis, et\r\n          Quinque bonos solitum Variam dimittere patres.[659]\r\n\r\nA comparison of the truthful and descriptive verses of Horace identify\r\nthe spot which he loved. Nature is the same now as it was then; but\r\nhuman skill and perseverance have adorned with the purple clusters of\r\nthe vine that “little corner of the world” which Horace said would bear\r\npepper and frankincense more quickly than grapes.[660]\r\n\r\nThe Satires of Horace occupy the position of the comedy of manners and\r\nthe fashionable novel. They are much more appropriately described by the\r\ntitle _Sermones_ (Discourses) which is also given to them. They are, in\r\nfact, desultory didactic essays, in which the topics are discussed just\r\nas they present themselves. In them is sketched boldly but\r\ngood-humouredly a picture of Roman social life with its vices and\r\nfollies. His object was (to use his own words)—\r\n\r\n                   Ut omnis\r\n     Votivâ pateat veluti descripta tabellâ\r\n     Vita.\r\n                                                 _Sat._ II. i. 32.\r\n\r\nVices, however, are treated as follies; and the man of wit and pleasure\r\nseldom uses a weapon more keen than the shafts of ridicule:—\r\n\r\n  Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico\r\n  Tangit et admissus circum præcordia ludit.\r\n                                          _Persius_, S. i. 116.\r\n\r\n        Arch Horace, while he strove to mend,\r\n  Probed all the foibles of his smiling friend;\r\n  Played lightly round and round the peccant part,\r\n  And won unfelt an entrance to his heart;\r\n  Well skilled the follies of the crowd to trace,\r\n  And sneer with gay good humour in his face.\r\n                                                      _Gifford._[661]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing of the political bitterness of Lucilius,[662] the love\r\nof purity and honour which adorns Persius, or the burning indignation\r\nwhich Juvenal pours forth at the loathsome corruption of morals. Horace\r\nhad been a politician and a warm champion of liberty; but the struggle\r\nwas now over, both with himself and his country. Ease and tranquillity\r\nwere insured to both by the new régime; and his contented temper\r\ndisposed him to acquiesce in a state of things which gave Rome time to\r\nrest from the horrors of civil war, and did not interfere with the\r\nindependence of the individual. Hence the circumstances of the times, as\r\nwell as his own temper, rendered his satires social and not political.\r\nLucilius wrote when the strife between nobles and people was still\r\nraging, and the latter had not as yet succumbed. He, therefore, breathed\r\nthe spirit of the old Athenian comic poets whom he followed and\r\nemulated; and the war of public opinion furnished him with topics\r\nsimilar to those which were discussed in the republican commonwealth of\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\nCircumstances also influenced, in some degree, the tone of Horace’s\r\nstrictures on the habits of social life. Immoral as society was, its\r\nmost salient features were luxury, frivolity, extravagance, and\r\neffeminacy. Vice had not reached that appalling height which it attained\r\nin the time of the emperor who succeeded Augustus. Deficient in moral\r\npurity, an Epicurean and a debauchee, nothing would strike him as\r\ndeserving censure, except such success as would actually defeat the\r\nobject which he proposed to himself—namely, the utmost enjoyment of\r\nlife. The dictates of prudence, therefore, would be his highest standard\r\nand his strongest check. He saw that public morals were already\r\ndeteriorated, and threatened to become worse; but though they were bad\r\nenough to provoke derision, they did not shock or revolt one who was,\r\nand who professed to be, a man of the world. Had Horace lived in the\r\ntime of Persius or Lucilius, even his satire would probably have been\r\npointed and severe.\r\n\r\nOften his satires are only accidentally didactic; he contents himself\r\nwith graphic delineations of character and manners, and leaves them to\r\nproduce their own moral effect upon the reader. In one[663] he holds up\r\nthe superstition of the Romans to ridicule by a minute narrative of the\r\nabsurd ceremonies performed by Canidia and another sorceress in their\r\nincantations. In another,[664] amusingly describes the annoyance to\r\nwhich he was exposed by the importunities of a gossiping trifler. In the\r\njourney to Brundisium he seems to have had no view beyond entertainment;\r\nalthough two incidents give him an opportunity of exposing the pomposity\r\nof a municipal official and the superstitious follies of a country\r\ntown.[665] In others, his subjects are the scenery and neighbouring\r\nsociety of his Sabine valley;[666] the way in which he is wont to spend\r\nhis day when at Rome; his own autobiography;[667] a laughable trial in\r\nAsia;[668] an essay on cookery;[669] and a candid exposure of his own\r\nfaults and inconsistencies. Not that he is forgetful of his moral duties\r\nas a satirist. He exposes to merited contempt the prevailing iniquities\r\nof the day. The meanness of legacy-hunting; the absurdity of pretension\r\nand foppery; the folly of an inordinate passion for amassing\r\nwealth;[670] the dangers of adultery;[671] the unfairness of\r\nuncharitably misinterpreting the conduct of others.[672]\r\n\r\nSuch are the varied subjects contained in the _Sermones_ or Satires of\r\nHorace. The Epistles are still more desultory and unrestrained.\r\nEpistolary writing is especially a Roman accomplishment. The Romans\r\nthought their correspondents deserved that as much pains should be\r\nbestowed on that which was addressed to them as on that which was\r\nintended for the public eye; and, in addition to the careful polish of\r\nwhich Cicero set the example, Horace brought to the task the\r\nembellishment of poetry. In the Epistles, he lays aside the character of\r\na moral teacher or censor. He treats his correspondent as an equal. He\r\nopens his heart unreservedly: he gives advice, but in a kind and gentle\r\nspirit, not with sneering severity. The satire is delivered _ex\r\ncathedrâ_;—the epistle with the freedom with which he would converse\r\nwith an intimate friend.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the first books are moral, those of the second critical.\r\nThe _Ars Poetica_ is but a poetical epistle addressed to the Pisos, who\r\nhad been bitten by the prevailing mania for tragic poetry. The usual\r\ntitle claims a far greater extent of subject than the poet intended. It\r\nis not a treatise on poetry, but simply an outline of the history of the\r\nGreek drama, and the principles of criticism applicable to it. It\r\nharmonizes well with the literary subjects treated of in the second book\r\nof the Epistles, and might well be included in it. It is, indeed, longer\r\nand more elaborate: a synopsis of so extensive a subject required more\r\ncareful treatment; but it is impossible to form a correct estimate of\r\nthe taste and judgment which it displays, unless it is considered as\r\nnothing more than an epistle.\r\n\r\nThe versification of these compositions is more smooth than that of the\r\nSatires, but only in proportion to the superior neatness of the style\r\ngenerally. In neither does the metrical harmony rise to the height of\r\npoetry, properly speaking. Doubtless this was the poet’s deliberate\r\nintention. It cannot be supposed that he who could so successfully\r\nintroduce all the beautiful Greek lyric metres, and in some cases\r\nimprove the delicacy of their structure, was incapable of reproducing\r\nthe rhythm of the Greek hexameter. He felt that in subjects belonging to\r\nthe prosaic realities of life, and hitherto treated with the\r\nconversational facility of the iambic measure, some appearance of\r\nnegligence and even roughness could alone render the stately hexameter\r\nappropriate, and therefore tolerable. But, admirable as the Satires are\r\nfor their artistic and dramatic power, and the Epistles for their\r\ncorrect taste, lively wit, and critical elegance, it is in his\r\ninimitable Odes that the genius of Horace as a poet is especially\r\ndisplayed. They have never been equalled in beauty of sentiment,\r\ngracefulness of language, and melody of versification. They comprehend\r\nevery variety of subject suitable to the lyric muse. They rise without\r\neffort to the most elevated topics—the grandest subjects of history, the\r\nmost gorgeous legends of mythology, the noblest aspirations of\r\npatriotism: they descend to the simplest joys and sorrows of every-day\r\nlife. At one time they burn with indignation, at another they pour forth\r\naccents of the tenderest emotions. They present in turn every phase of\r\nthe author’s character: some remind us that he was a philosopher and a\r\nsatirist; and although many are sensuous and self-indulgent, they are\r\nfull of gentleness, kindness, and spirituality. Not only do they evince\r\na complete mastery over the Greek metres, but also show that Horace was\r\nthoroughly imbued with the spirit of Greek poetry, and had profoundly\r\nstudied Greek literature, especially the writings of Pindar and the\r\nlyric poets. Numerous as the instances are in which he has imitated\r\nthem, and introduced by a happy adaptation their ideas, epithets, and\r\nphrases, his imitations are not mere plagiarisms or purple patches—they\r\nare made so completely his own, and are invested with so much novelty\r\nand originality, that, when compared with the original, we receive\r\nadditional gratification from discovering the resemblance. The\r\nsentiments which are paraphrased seem improved: the expressions which\r\nare translated seem so appropriate, and harmonize so exactly with the\r\ncontext, that a poet, whose memory was stored with them, would have been\r\nguilty of bad taste if he had substituted any others. Greek feelings,\r\nsentiments, and imagery, are so naturally amalgamated with Roman\r\nmanners, that they seem to have undergone a transmigration, and to\r\nanimate a Roman form. The following are some of the most striking\r\nparallelisms:[673]—\r\n\r\n    Sunt quos curriculo, &c.\r\n                                                _Carm._ 1, 3, _seq._\r\n\r\n     Ἀελλοποδων μεν τινας ευφραινουσιν ἱππων τιμαι και στεφανοι·\r\n     τους δ’ εν πολυχρυσοις θαλαμοις βιοτα·\r\n     τερπεται δε και τις επ’ οιδμ’ αλιον\r\n     ναι θοα σως διαστειχων.\r\n                                                    _Pind.

CILNIUS MÆCENAS.\r\n\r\nIn a literary history it is impossible to omit some account of one, who,\r\nalthough his attempts at poetry were very contemptible, exercised, by\r\nhis good taste and munificence, a great influence upon literature, and\r\nto whom the literary men of Rome were much indebted for the use which he\r\nmade of his confidential friendship with Augustus.\r\n\r\nC. Cilnius Mæcenas was a member of an equestrian family, which, though\r\nit derived its descent from the old Etruscan kings,[675] does not appear\r\nto have produced any distinguished individuals. His birth-year is\r\nunknown, but his birth-day was the ides (13th) of April.[676] We have no\r\ninformation respecting the origin of his intimacy with Augustus.\r\nProbably his cultivated taste, his extensive acquaintance with Greek and\r\nRoman literature, his imperturbable temper, and love of pleasure, first\r\nrecommended him as an agreeable companion to Octavius.\r\n\r\nHis good sense, activity, and energy in business, and decisive\r\ncharacter, qualities in which his irresolute and desultory patron was\r\nsignally deficient, enabled him rapidly to improve the acquaintance into\r\nintimacy. It is said by Dion Cassius[677] that Augustus obtained from\r\nMæcenas a complete plan for the internal administration of his\r\nnewly-acquired empire, and that in it were displayed sound judgment and\r\npolitical wisdom. It is probable that there is some exaggeration in this\r\nstatement; but that, without being a great man, he was in these respects\r\na greater man than Augustus, who, therefore, when he required his\r\nsupport, could lean upon him with safety. And yet his weaknesses were\r\nsuch as to prevent any feeling of jealousy, or appearance of\r\nsuperiority, from endangering his friendship with the emperor. His love\r\nof pleasure, and of the quiet and careless enjoyments of a private\r\nstation, proved, as it turned out, a blessing to his country. His heart\r\nwas so full of the delights of refined and intellectual society—of\r\npalaces and gardens, and wit and poetry, and collections of art and\r\nvirtû—that there was no room in it for ambition. His careless and\r\nsauntering indolence was openly displayed in his lounging gait, and his\r\ntoga trailing on the ground. No one could possibly suspect such a\r\nloiterer of sufficient energy or application to be a politician and an\r\nintriguer. Such being his character, tastes, and habits, he felt no\r\ntemptation to abuse his influence with Augustus. He did not covet\r\nhonours and office, because he knew they must bring trouble and\r\ndistraction, perhaps peril with them. He exercised his power, which was\r\nundoubtedly great, to promote that luxurious, yet refined elegance, in\r\nwhich he himself delighted, and to secure the welfare of his literary\r\nfriends. He had wealth enough to gratify his utmost wishes. Augustus,\r\ntherefore, had nothing more to confer on him which he valued, except\r\npersonal esteem and regard.\r\n\r\nThe confidence which the Emperor reposed in him is shown by his\r\nemploying him in some affairs of great delicacy: first, in arranging a\r\nmarriage with Scribonia; and, subsequently, on two occasions, in\r\nnegotiating with Antony.[678] In B. C. 36, he accompanied Octavius into\r\nSicily; but was sent back in order to undertake the administration of\r\nRome and Italy;[679] and during the campaign at Actium,[680] Mæcenas was\r\nagain vicegerent, in which capacity he crushed the conspiracy of the\r\nyounger Lepidus. So unlimited was his power, that he was even intrusted\r\nwith the signet of Octavius, and with authority to open, and even to\r\nalter, if necessary, all letters which he wrote to the senate during his\r\ncampaign; and when the victorious general, on his return to Rome,\r\nconsulted with him and Agrippa as to the expediency of re-establishing\r\nthe republic, Mæcenas, in opposition to the recommendation of Agrippa,\r\ndissuaded him from taking that step. The moral influence also of Mæcenas\r\nover Augustus is very striking. So long as it continued, we see nothing\r\nof that heartless cruelty, that disregard of the happiness of others,\r\nwhich deformed the early life of the Emperor: if he was heartless, he at\r\nleast did that as a matter of taste which a better man would have done\r\non principle; and if he was still selfish, he sought fame and glory by\r\nthe wise counsels of peace rather than by the brilliant triumphs of war:\r\nhe conciliated friends instead of crushing enemies.\r\n\r\nThe intimacy between Mæcenas and the Emperor continued for at least ten\r\nyears after the battle of Actium: then an estrangement commenced; and in\r\nB. C. 16, he was deprived of his official position, and Taurus was\r\nintrusted with the administration of Rome and Italy. Scandalous stories\r\nhave been told about his wife Terentia and the Emperor, in order to\r\naccount for the interruption of their intimacy; but no special causes\r\nare necessary to account for an event so common. The words of\r\nTacitus[681] are a sufficient solution of the problem:—“Idque et\r\nMæcenati acciderat; fato potentiæ, raro sempiternæ, an satias capit, aut\r\nillos, cum omnia tribuerunt, aut hos, cum jam nihil reliquum est, quod\r\ncupiant.” He retained the outward appearance of the imperial friendship,\r\nalthough he had lost the reality. He went to court on the birth-day, but\r\nceased to be of the Emperor’s council. His life was passed in the\r\nvoluptuous retirement of his palace on the Esquiline, which he had built\r\nfor himself. This hill was not generally considered wholesome: probably\r\nthe fact that it had been a burial-ground[682] created a prejudice\r\nagainst it; but the loftiness of the site chosen, as well as of the\r\nbuilding itself (_molem vicinam nubibus_,) and the breeze which played\r\nfreely through the lovely garden with which it was surrounded, rendered\r\nit salubrious. All the most brilliant society of Rome was found at his\r\ntable; and many of the best of them received still more substantial\r\nmarks of his favour.[683] Virgil, Horace, Propertius, and Varius, were\r\namongst his friends and constant associates.\r\n\r\nMæcenas was a low-spirited invalid;[684] latterly he could not sleep,\r\nand endeavoured in vain to procure repose by listening to soft\r\nmusic.[685] In his last distressing illness he generally resided at his\r\nTiburtine villa, where the murmuring falls of the Anio invited that\r\nsleep which was denied him elsewhere. He died B. C. 8, and was buried on\r\nthe Esquiline. Though married, he left no children, and bequeathed his\r\nproperty to the Emperor, whom he besought in his will not to forget his\r\nbeloved Horace. His taste as a critic was evidently far superior to his\r\ntalents as a writer. Few fragments of his writings remain; and all\r\nancient critics are unanimous in the condemnation of his style.\r\nAugustus[686] laughed at his affected jargon of mingled Etruscan and\r\nLatin. Quintilian[687] quotes instances of his absurd inversions and\r\ntranspositions; and Seneca[688] shows, by an example, its unintelligible\r\nobscurity.[689] He was a sensualist and a voluptuary,[690] and an\r\nunfaithful husband; and yet he was devotedly fond of his wife, the\r\nbeautiful but ill-tempered Terentia, who had a great influence over him.\r\nHe would divorce her one day only to restore her to conjugal rights on\r\nthe next; and Seneca said that, though he had only one wife, he was\r\nmarried a thousand times. He abhorred cruelty and severity, and would\r\nnot let it pass unrebuked even in the Emperor; and although he made a\r\nboast of effeminacy, he was ready to devote himself heartily to business\r\nin cases of emergency. In fact, he was a fair specimen of the man of\r\npleasure and society: liberal, kind-hearted, clever, refined, but\r\nluxurious, self-indulgent, indolent, and volatile, with good instincts\r\nand impulses, but without principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           C. VALGIUS RUFUS.\r\n\r\nAmongst the poets of the Augustan age, whose writings were much admired\r\nby their contemporaries, but have not stood the searching test of time,\r\nwas Valgius Rufus. Of his life no records remain; but he probably\r\nbelonged to that class of authors of whom Pliny says, “Quibus nos in\r\nvehiculo, in balneo, inter cœnam, oblectamus otium temporis.”[691] They\r\nwere light and pleasing, calculated to amuse an idle half-hour, or to\r\nrelieve the tedium of a journey. They answered the purpose of the\r\nrailroad literature of our own days. These writers had a correct taste,\r\nand a critical discernment of poetical beauty, rather than a genius for\r\npoetical composition. Probably their personal characters had something\r\nto do with their reputation: they were members of a literary _coterie_;\r\nthey lived, thought, and felt together; they defended each other against\r\nmalicious criticism; and the bonds of friendship by which they were\r\nunited tempted the greater poets to regard their effusions with kind but\r\nundue partiality. Valgius Rufus was a great favourite of Horace,[692]\r\nbut only a few short, isolated passages are extant of his poems.[693]\r\nQuintilian[694] attributes to him a translation of the rhetorical\r\nprecepts of Apollodorus. Seneca[695] mentions him by name: Pliny[696]\r\npraises his erudition. The testimony borne to his transcendent merits as\r\nan epic poet, in the Panegyric of Messala, need scarcely be trusted,\r\nbecause it is almost certain that this piece is spurious.[697]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                VARIUS.\r\n\r\nOf L. Varius Rufus also, who was one of the constant guests at Mæcenas’\r\ntable, scarcely any thing is known. Horace[698] tells us that he was\r\nunequalled in epic song, when Virgil had as yet only turned his\r\nattention to rustic poetry. The high praise bestowed upon his Thyestes\r\nby Quintilian has already been mentioned. To him, together with Virgil,\r\nwe have seen that Horace owed his introduction to Augustus, and all\r\nthree were of the party which accompanied Mæcenas to Brundisium. The\r\ntitles of two of his poems are extant,—I. _De Morte_; II. _Panegyric on\r\nAugustus_. Of the former, four fragments are preserved by Macrobius, all\r\nof which Virgil has deemed worthy of imitation. Of the latter, two\r\nlines, containing a delicate compliment to Augustus, are extant, which\r\nHorace has introduced entire into one of his Epistles.[699] The passage\r\nby no means satisfies modern taste, which has been formed by the\r\nhexametrical rhythm of Virgil; but Seneca praises his style as free from\r\nthe usual faults of Latin declamatory poetry—mere bombast on the one\r\nhand, and excessive minuteness on the other. Niebuhr conjectures that\r\nhis Thyestes was too declamatory; and that, like the later Roman\r\ntragedies of Seneca and others, it was not an imitation of the Attic\r\ndrama, but of the degenerate tragedies belonging to the Alexandrian\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n               C. CORNELIUS GALLUS (BORN B. C. 66 or 69.)\r\n\r\nGallus was more distinguished as a general than as a poet. Except a\r\nsingle line from one of his elegies, not a vestige of his poetry\r\nremains; for the short pieces attributed to him[700] are undoubtedly not\r\ngenuine. He owes his fame, probably, to the kind verdict of his\r\ncontemporaries, whose friendship and amiable affection for each other\r\nappear never to have been endangered by the slightest spark of jealousy.\r\n\r\nBorn at Frejus, of low parentage, he was a fellow-student in philosophy\r\nwith Virgil[701] and Arius—a friendship thus commenced which continued\r\nthrough life. The patronage of Asinius Pollio[702] brought him into\r\nnotice as a poet at the early age of twenty. He was one of the first to\r\nattach himself to the cause of Octavius; and, being appointed\r\ncommissioner for allotting the lands to the military colonies, he had\r\nthe opportunity of befriending Virgil and the plundered Mantuans. At\r\nActium he commanded a brigade, burnt Antony’s ships in the harbour of\r\nParætonium, was one of the capturers of Cleopatra, and was rewarded by\r\nOctavius with being made first prefect of Egypt. How so valuable a\r\nservant lost the Emperor’s favour is uncertain. Ovid hints that his\r\ncrime was one of words, not of deeds:—\r\n\r\n                    Linguam nimio non tenuisse mero.\r\n\r\nHe was recalled, his property confiscated, and himself exiled. He had\r\nnot strength of mind to bear his fall, and he committed suicide in the\r\nforty-first or forty-third year of his age.[703]\r\n\r\nNo judgment respecting his merits can be formed from the contradictory\r\ncriticism of the ancients. Ovid awards to him the palm among the elegiac\r\npoets,[704] and Virgil is said to have sung his praises in his fourth\r\nGeorgic, but afterwards to have omitted the passage and substituted for\r\nit the story of Aristæus; whilst Quintilian[705] applies the epithet\r\n_durior_ to his versification. Perhaps the latter attached too much\r\nimportance to the grace and sweetness of diction, but neglected the\r\nbeauty of the sentiments; whilst the former might have been too partial\r\nin his sympathy with a fellow exile. He was the author of four books of\r\nelegies, in which, under the feigned name of Lycoris, he sings his love\r\nfor his mistress Cytheris. He also translated the Greek poems of\r\nEuphorion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ALBIUS TIBULLUS.\r\n\r\nTibullus was born of an equestrian family, probably in B. C. 54. He was\r\na contemporary of Virgil and Horace;[706] and like them, during the\r\ntroubles of the civil wars, suffered the confiscation of his paternal\r\nestate, which was situated at Pedum, near Tibur. After the conclusion of\r\nthe struggle a portion was restored to him—small, indeed, but sufficient\r\nto satisfy his moderate wants and contented disposition.\r\n\r\nDisinclined, as well by his love of quiet, to the labours and perils of\r\na military life, as he was by the tenderness and softness of his\r\ncharacter to the horrors of war, circumstances, nevertheless, forced him\r\ninvoluntarily to undertake a campaign. Messala was his patron, to whom\r\nhe was evidently under great obligations.[707] When, therefore, he was\r\nsent by Octavia to quell an insurrection in Aquitania, Tibullus\r\naccompanied him. This campaign and the successes of Messala furnished\r\nthe poet with subjects for his muse.[708] Tibullus also fully intended\r\nto continue his services to Messala in the east, during the following\r\nyear; but illness compelled him to stop at Corcyra, whence he returned\r\nto Rome.[709]\r\n\r\nThe mistresses whose beauty, inconstancy, and cruelty Tibullus\r\ncelebrates in his elegies were, unlike those of Horace, real persons.\r\nDelia’s real name is said to have been Plautia or Plania;[710] who\r\nNemesis was is not known. These are the only two mentioned by himself or\r\nalluded to by Ovid;[711] but Horace addresses an ode to him on his\r\npassion for a mistress whom he names Glycera. Probably he is speaking of\r\none of Tibullus’ mistresses under a feigned name, in accordance with his\r\nhabitual practice, for the names introduced by him in his poems,\r\ngenerally speaking, bear no appearance of reality. They are, with very\r\nfew exceptions, suggested by his study of Greek lyric poets. Chloris,\r\nLycoris, Neobule, Lydia, Thaliarchus, Xanthias, Pholoe, are all Greek\r\ncharacters, translated to Roman scenes, and made to play an artificial\r\npart in Roman life. Cinara[712] was, perhaps, a real person, as Bassus,\r\nthe Novii Mævius, and Numida, undoubtedly are. Sometimes, when his\r\nobject is satire, he speaks of the subject of his irony under a name\r\nsomewhat resembling the real one; as, for example, when he ridicules\r\nMæcenas under the name of Malthinus,[713] Salvidianus Rufus under that\r\nof Nasidianus,[714] and lampoons Gratidia the sorceress as Canidia. But\r\nin the poetry of Tibullus, as in that of Catullus and Propertius, the\r\nsame names are found in each of a series of poems. Apuleius[715] asserts\r\nthat the real name of the Lesbia of Catullus was Clodia; that of the\r\nCynthia of Propertius, Hostia, and that she was a native of Tivoli.\r\n\r\nThe style and tone of thought of Tibullus are, like his character,\r\ndeficient in vigour and manliness, but sweet, smooth, polished, tender,\r\nand never disfigured by bad taste. He does not deserve the censure of\r\nNiebuhr, who stigmatizes him as a “disagreeable poet, because of his\r\ndoleful and weeping melancholy and sentimentality, resulting from\r\nmisunderstanding the ancient elegies of Mimnermus.”[716]\r\n\r\nAfter his return from Corcyra, Tibullus passed the remainder of his\r\nshort life in the peaceful retirement of his paternal estate. He died\r\nyoung, shortly after Virgil, if we may trust to an epigram, ascribed to\r\nDomitius Marsus, contained in the Latin Anthologia:[717]—\r\n\r\n             Te quoque Virgilio comitem non æqua, Tibulle,\r\n               Mors juvenem campos misit in Elysios,\r\n             Ne foret, aut elegis molles qui fleret amores,\r\n               Aut caneret forti regia bella pede.\r\n\r\nThe poems commonly ascribed to Tibullus consist of four books, but only\r\ntwo are genuine, and of these, the second was published posthumously.\r\nTwo lines in the third book, which fix the date of the poet’s birth in\r\nthe consulship of Hirtius and Pansa,[718] have generally been considered\r\nas spurious, because such a date is inconsistent with the rest of the\r\nchronology; but Voss rejected the whole of that book; and there is no\r\nquestion but that the spirit and character of the elegies, as well as\r\nthe harmony of the metre, are very inferior to those of the preceding\r\npoems. The same inferiority marks the fourth also, with the exception of\r\nthe smaller poems, which bear the names of Sulpicia and Corinthus.\r\nThese, as Niebuhr correctly observes, display greater energy and\r\nboldness than Tibullus possessed, and are the productions of some poet\r\nmuch superior to him.\r\n\r\nThat elegant scholar and judicious critic, Muretus,[719] has well\r\nattributed to him, as his chief characteristics, simplicity, and natural\r\nand unaffected genius:—“Illum (_i. e._ Tibullum) judices _simplicius_\r\nscripsisse quæ cogitaret; hunc (_i. e._ Propertium) diligentius\r\ncogitasse quæ scriberet. In illo _plus naturæ_, in hoc plus curæ atque\r\nindustriæ perspicias.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SEXTUS AURELIUS PROPERTIUS.\r\n\r\nVery little is known respecting the life and personal history of\r\nPropertius beyond the few facts which may be gleaned from his poems. He\r\nwas a native of the border country of Umbria, and was probably born not\r\nearlier than A. U. C. 703,[720] or later than 700.[721] This period will\r\nsufficiently agree with the statement of Ovid respecting their relative\r\nages.[722] His family had not produced any distinguished member, but\r\npossessed a competent estate. Like Virgil and Tibullus, he was a\r\nsufferer by the consequences of war; for the establishment of a military\r\ncolony reduced him from comfort to straitened circumstances.[723]\r\n\r\nLike most young Romans of genius and education, he was intended for the\r\nbar;[724] but poetry had greater charms for him than severe studies, and\r\nhe became nothing more than a literary man. He inhabited a house in the\r\nnow fashionable quarter of the Esquiline, and was on intimate terms with\r\nGallus, Ovid, Bassus, and Virgil. Cynthia, his amour with whom inspired\r\nso large a portion of his elegies, was not only a beautiful but an\r\naccomplished woman. She was his first love; and it appears to have been\r\nsome time before she yielded to his solicitations,[725] nor was she even\r\nthen always faithful to him.[726] She could write verses and play upon\r\nthe lyre,[727] and was a graceful dancer.[728] She owed to him, says\r\nMartial, her immortality; whilst he owed to his love for her the\r\ninspiration which immortalized himself:—\r\n\r\n               Cynthia, facundi carmen juvenile Properti,\r\n                 Accepit famam nec minus illa dedit.\r\n\r\nThe date of the poet’s death is unknown, but the probability is that he\r\ndied young.\r\n\r\nAlthough Propertius was a contemporary and friend of the Augustan poets,\r\nhe may be considered as belonging to a somewhat different school of\r\npoetry. His taste, like theirs, was educated by a study of Greek\r\nliterature; but the Greek poets whose works he took for his model\r\nbelonged to a later age. Horace, Virgil and Tibullus imitated and tried\r\nto rival the Greek classical poets of the noblest ages: they transferred\r\ninto their native tongue the ideas of Homer, Pindar, and the old lyric\r\npoets. Their taste was formed after the purest and most perfect models.\r\nPropertius, on the other hand, was content with a lower flight. He\r\nattempted nothing more than to imitate the graceful but feeble strains\r\nof the Alexandrian poets, and to become a second Callimachus or\r\nPhiletas.[729] Roman perseverance in the pursuit of learning, and the\r\nspirit of investigation in the wide field of Greek literature, had\r\nraised up this new standard of taste, which was by no means an\r\nimprovement upon that which had been hitherto established.\r\n\r\nThe imitations of Propertius are too studied and apparent to permit him\r\nto lay claim to great natural genius. Nature alone could give the\r\ntouching tenderness of Tibullus or the facility of Ovid—in both of\r\nwhich, notwithstanding his grace and elegance, he is deficient. The\r\nabsence of original fancy is concealed by minute attention to the\r\noutward form of the poetry which he admired. His pentameters are often\r\ninharmonious, because they adopt so continually the Greek rules of\r\nconstruction; awkward Greek idioms, and a studious display of his\r\nlearning, which was undoubtedly great, destroy that greatest charm of\r\nstyle, perspicuity.\r\n\r\nAccording to Quintilian,[730] the critics of his day somewhat overrated\r\nhis merits, for they could scarcely decide the question of superiority\r\nbetween him and Tibullus. This, however, is to be expected in an age of\r\naffected rhetoric and grammatical pedantry, when nothing was considered\r\nbeautiful in poetry except that which was in accordance with the\r\narbitrary rules of cold criticism. They appreciated his correctness, and\r\ndid not miss the warm heart of his rival. His poetry is not so polluted\r\nwith indelicacy as that of Ovid, but still it is often sensual and\r\nlicentious.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that the fourth elegy of the third book, entitled\r\n“Arethusa to Lycotas,” deprives Ovid of the credit of being the inventor\r\nof the elegiac epistle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ÆMILIUS MACER.\r\n\r\nThe poem of Æmilius Macer is only known through two verses in the\r\nTristia of Ovid,[731] which state that it treated of birds, serpents,\r\nand medicinal herbs:\r\n\r\n             Sæpe suas volucres legit mihi grandior ævo\r\n               Quæque necet serpens; quæ juvet herba Macer.\r\n\r\nHe was born at Verona, and died in Asia, A. D. 16; and the passage\r\nalready quoted proves that he was older than Ovid.\r\n\r\nHis poem was a paraphrase or imitation of the Theriaca of Nicander—a\r\nphysician-poet, who flourished in Ætolia during the reign of Ptolemy\r\nEpiphanes. Quintilian couples his name with that of Lucretius; and\r\nawards him the praise of elegance, but adds that his style is deficient\r\nin dignity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n BIRTH AND EDUCATION OF OVID—HIS RHETORICAL POWERS—ANECDOTE RELATED BY\r\n               SENECA—HIS POETICAL GENIUS—SELF-INDULGENT\r\n    LIFE—POPULARITY—BANISHMENT—PLACE OF HIS EXILE—EPISTLES AND OTHER\r\n WORKS—GRATIUS FALISCUS—PEDO ALBINOVANUS—AULUS SABINUS—MARCUS MANILIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     OVIDIUS NASO (BORN B. C. 43.)\r\n\r\nOvid, as he himself states,[732] was born at Sulmo (Sulmone,) a town of\r\nthe Peligni (Abruzzi,) ninety miles distant from Rome. The year of his\r\nbirth was that in which the consuls Hirtius and Pansa fell in the field\r\nof Mutina (Modena.) His family was equestrian, and had been so for some\r\ngenerations. His father lived to the age of ninety; and, as his mother\r\nwas then alive, it is probable that she also attained an advanced age.\r\nHe had a brother exactly twelve months older than himself. Their common\r\nbirthday was the first of the Quinquatria, or festival of Minerva (March\r\n20th.)\r\n\r\nWhilst still of tender age the two boys were sent to Rome for education,\r\nand placed under the care of eminent instructors. The elder studied\r\neloquence, and was brought up to the bar: but he died at the early age\r\nof twenty. Ovid himself also, for a time, studied rhetoric under\r\nArellius Fuscus and Porcius Latro, and the results of his study are\r\nvisible in his poems;[733] for example, in the speeches of Ajax and\r\nUlysses.[734]\r\n\r\nSeneca has left an interesting account of his rhetorical powers.[735] “I\r\nremember,” he says, “hearing Naso declaim, in the presence of Arellius\r\nFuscus, of whom he was a pupil; for he was an admirer of Latro, although\r\nhis style was different from his own. The style of Ovid could at that\r\ntime be termed nothing else but poetry in prose: still he was so\r\ndiligent as to transfer many of his sentiments into his verses. Latro\r\nhad said—\r\n\r\n                  Mittamus arma in hostes, et petamus.\r\n\r\nNaso wrote—\r\n\r\n              Arma viri fortis medios mittantur in hostes\r\n              Inde jubete peti.\r\n\r\nHe borrowed another idea from one of Latro’s Suasorian orations:—\r\n\r\n      Non vides uti immota fax torpeat et exagitata reddat ignes?\r\n\r\nOvid’s paraphrase of this illustration is—\r\n\r\n             Vidi ego jactatas mota face crescere flammas,\r\n               Et rursus, nullo concutiente, mori.\r\n\r\nWhen he was a student he was thought to declaim well.”\r\n\r\nOn the affecting theme of a husband and wife, who had mutually sworn not\r\nto survive each other, Seneca asserts that he surpassed his master in\r\nwit and talent, and was only inferior in the arrangement of his topics.\r\nHe then quotes a long passage, in which Ovid analyzes the principles of\r\nlove, with a skill and ingenuity well worthy of one who, as a poet, made\r\nlove the subject of his song, and with a purity of sentiment which, it\r\nwere to be wished, had dignified the sweetness of his verses. Ovid\r\npreferred _suasoriæ_ and ethical themes to _controversiæ_;[736] for all\r\nargument was irksome to him. In oratory he was very careful in the use\r\nof his words: in his poetry he was aware of his faults, but loved them\r\ntoo well to correct them. He then adds the following amusing and\r\ncharacteristic anecdote:—Being once asked by his friends to erase three\r\nlines, he consented on condition that he himself should be at liberty to\r\nmake an exception in favour of three. He accordingly wrote down three\r\nwhich he wished to preserve; his friends those which they wished to\r\nerase. The papers were examined, and both were found to contain the same\r\nverses. Pedo Albinovanus used to say that one of these was—\r\n\r\n                 Semibovemque virum semivirumque bovem.\r\n\r\nThe other—\r\n\r\n                  Egelidum Borean, egelidumque Notum.\r\n\r\nHence it is apparent that judgment was not wanting, but the inclination\r\nto correct. He defended himself by saying that an occasional mole is an\r\nimprover of beauty. The former of these miserable conceits is not now to\r\nbe found in his poems. The latter occurs in the _Amores_, but it is\r\nusually read—\r\n\r\n                 Et gelidum Borean, egelidumque Notum;\r\n\r\nor—\r\n\r\n              Et gelidum Borean, præcipitemque Notum.[737]\r\n\r\nThe father of Ovid, who took a utilitarian view of life, is said to have\r\ndiscouraged the cultivation of his poetical talents, and to have\r\nstigmatized the service of the Muses as barren and unprofitable. Even\r\nHomer himself, he was wont to say, left no property behind him. Ovid\r\nendeavoured to comply with his father’s wishes; he deserted Helicon, and\r\ntried to write plain prose. It was all in vain; his words spontaneously\r\nflowed into numbers, and whatever he tried to say was poetry. His\r\nnatural genius and facility displayed itself when he was quite a boy;\r\nfor he had not yet put on the _toga virilis_. When he assumed this badge\r\nof mature age, it was bordered with a broad purple stripe, which marked\r\nthe patrician order; but being unambitious and indolent, he never took\r\nhis seat in the senate, although he filled several magisterial and\r\njudicial offices.\r\n\r\nHis rank, fortune, and talents enabled him to cultivate the society of\r\nmen of congenial tastes. He became acquainted with the best poets of his\r\nday. Macer and Propertius would recite their compositions to him.\r\nPonticus and Bassus were guests at his table. He had heard the lyrics of\r\nHorace read by himself. Virgil he had only seen; and the untimely death\r\nof Tibullus prevented him from making the acquaintance of that poet. He\r\nwas extremely young when his juvenile poems became very popular, and he\r\nwrote far more than he published; for he burnt whatever displeased him;\r\nand, when sentenced to exile, in disgust he committed the Metamorphoses\r\nto the flames.\r\n\r\nHe himself confesses his natural susceptibility and amorous temperament;\r\nbut claims the credit of never having given occasion to any scandal. He\r\nwas three times married. His first wife was unsuitable, and proved\r\nunworthy of him, and accordingly he divorced her. His second he divorced\r\nalso, although no imputation rested on her virtue. From his third, whom,\r\nnotwithstanding his fickleness and infidelity, he sincerely loved, he\r\nwas only separated by exile. She was one of the Fabian family, and bore\r\nhim one daughter.\r\n\r\nEpicurean in his tastes, and a skeptic, if not a disbeliever in a future\r\nstate, he lived a life of continual self-indulgence and intrigue. He was\r\na universal admirer and as universal a favourite among the female sex in\r\nthe voluptuous capital; for the tone of female morals was in that age\r\nlow and depraved, and the women encouraged the licentiousness of the\r\nmen. Although his favourite mistress, whom he celebrated under the\r\nfictitious name of Corinna, is unknown, and all the conjectures\r\nconcerning her identity are groundless, there is no doubt that she was a\r\nlady of rank and fortune.\r\n\r\nOvid was popular as a poet, successful in society, and possessed all the\r\nenjoyments which wealth can bestow. He had a villa and estate in his\r\nnative Sulmo, a house on the Capitoline hill, and suburban gardens,\r\ncelebrated for their beauty. At some period of his life he travelled\r\nwith Macer into Asia and Sicily; and, in his exile, recalls to mind with\r\nsorrowful pleasure the magnificent cities of the former, and the sublime\r\nscenery and classic haunts of the latter.[738] This sunny life at length\r\ncame to an end. The last ray of happiness, which he speaks of as beaming\r\non him, was the intelligence that his beloved daughter Perilla, who was\r\ntwice married, made him a grandfather a second time. When his hair\r\nbecame tinged with white, and he had reached his fiftieth year, he\r\nincurred, by some fault or indiscretion, the anger of Augustus, and was\r\nbanished to Tomi (Tomoswar or Baba.)\r\n\r\nThe cause of his banishment is involved in obscurity. It was not unknown\r\nat Rome; but in his exile he refrains from alluding to it, except in\r\ndark allusions, out of fear of giving additional offence to the\r\nemperor.[739] He speaks of it as an indiscretion (_error_,) not a crime\r\n(_scelus_, _facinus_;[740]) as something which he had accidentally\r\nwitnessed,[741] perhaps had indiscreetly told—a circumstance which\r\ndeeply and personally affected Augustus, and inflicted a wound which he\r\nwas unwilling to tear open afresh. He hints also that he fell a victim\r\nto the treachery of friends and domestics,[742] who enriched themselves\r\nby his ruin.\r\n\r\nThere have been many conjectures[743] on this difficult point. Some have\r\nimagined an intrigue with the elder Julia, the profligate daughter of\r\nAugustus; but this is scarcely consistent with the manner in which Ovid\r\nhimself speaks of his fault; and besides this, Julia was banished to\r\nPandataria eight years before. The banishment of the younger Julia to\r\nTrimerus, about the same time with that of Ovid, would make it far more\r\nprobable that his fall was connected with that of this equally\r\nprofligate princess. Tiraboschi supposed that he had surprised one of\r\nthe royal family in some disgraceful act; and some have even imagined\r\nthat he might have witnessed such conduct on the part of the Emperor\r\nhimself. Dryden believed that he accidentally saw Livia in the bath; and\r\nthe author of the article in the Biographie Universelle, as well as\r\nSchoell,[744] surmise that he was in some way implicated in the fortunes\r\nof Agrippa Posthumus, and thus incurred the hatred of Livia and\r\nTiberius.\r\n\r\nWhatever the cause may have been, the punishment was a cruel one, except\r\nfor a crime of the deepest dye, and would never have been inflicted by\r\nthe gentle Augustus so long as he was under the salutary influence of\r\nMæcenas and his party. But in his old age he submitted to the baneful\r\nrule of the dark Tiberius and the implacable Livia. Any pretext,\r\ntherefore, sufficed to remove one, who, from some cause or other, had\r\nexcited their enmity. The alleged reason was the immorality of his\r\nwritings; but they are not more immoral than those of Horace; and,\r\nbesides, the worst of them had been published ten years before. Nor was\r\nthe morality of the Emperor himself of such a character as to lead him\r\nto punish so severely a licentious poet in a licentious age. The\r\nexclusion of his works from the Palatine[745] library was a merited and\r\nmore appropriate visitation. Nevertheless, this was made the pretext for\r\na banishment, the misery of which was solaced by the empty mockery of\r\nthe reservation of his civil rights.\r\n\r\nTomi was on the very frontiers of the Roman empire, inhabited by the\r\nGetæ, who were rude and uncivilized. The country itself, a barren and\r\ntreeless waste, cold, damp, and marshy, producing naturally scarcely\r\nanything but wormwood, and yielding scanty crops to the unskilled toil\r\nof ignorant cultivators, was rendered still more desolate by frequent\r\nincursions of the neighbouring savage tribes, who used poisoned arrows,\r\nand offered up as sacrifices their prisoners of war.[746] Ovid, who,\r\nwith all his faults, was affectionate and tender-hearted, was torn from\r\nall the voluptuous blandishments of the capital, from the sympathies of\r\ncongenial spirits, who could appreciate his talents, and from the arms\r\nof his weeping wife,[747] amidst the voice of wailing and of prayer,\r\nwhich filled every corner of his desolate dwelling. The blow fell\r\nsuddenly upon him like a thunder-clap,[748] and so stupefied him that he\r\ncould make no preparations for his voyage. The season of his departure\r\nwas the depth of winter, and he was exposed to some peril by a tempest\r\nin the Ionian Gulf. The climate of his new abode was as inclement as\r\nthat of Scythia. Not only the Danube, but even the sea near its mouth,\r\nwas for some extent covered with ice: even the wine froze into blocks,\r\nand was broken in pieces before it could be used. He lived in exile only\r\nten years; constant anxiety preyed upon his bodily health; he suffered\r\nlanguor, but no pain; he loathed all food; the little that he ate would\r\nnot digest; sleep failed him; his body became pale and emaciated, and so\r\nhe died. The Tomitæ showed their respect by erecting a tomb to his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of such a contrast between the present and the past, no\r\nwonder that his complainings appear almost pitiful and unmanly, and his\r\nurgent petitions to Augustus couched in too fulsome a strain of\r\nadulation. No wonder that he painted in the most glowing colours the\r\nstory of his woes and privations. Yet he was destitute neither of\r\npatience nor fortitude: he relied on the independence and immortality of\r\ngenius; and although the enervating effect of a luxurious and easy life\r\nand a delicate constitution, rendered him a prey to grief, and he\r\ngradually pined away, still he had strength of mind to relieve his\r\nsorrows by devotion to the Muse, and he suffered with tranquillity and\r\nresignation. Poetry was his resource during his stormy voyage. Poetry\r\ngained him the affection and esteem of his new fellow-citizens,\r\nnotwithstanding their barbarism,[749] and procured him the honour of a\r\ntomb.\r\n\r\nAll the extant poems of Ovid, with the exception of the Metamorphoses,\r\nare elegiac. It was the metre then most in vogue. All the minor poets,\r\nhis contemporaries, wrote in it. One of his earliest works is the\r\n“Amores,” a collection of elegies, most of which are addressed to his\r\nfavourite mistress Corinna. Some of them, however, were composed\r\nsubsequently to his Epistles and Art of Love.[750] An epigram, which is\r\nprefixed, states that there were originally five books, but that the\r\nauthor subsequently reduced them to the present number, three.\r\nLicentiousness disfigures these annals of his amours; but they teem with\r\nthe freshness and buoyancy of youth, and sparkle with grace and\r\ningenuity.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-one _Epistolæ Heroidum_, i. e. Epistles to and from Women of\r\nthe Heroic Age, are a series of love-letters: their characteristic\r\nfeature is passion; the ardour of which is sometimes interfered with by\r\ntoo laboured conceits and excessive refinement. They are, in fact, the\r\nmost polished efforts of one whose natural indolence often disinclined\r\nhim from expending that time and pains on the work of amending and\r\ncorrecting which distinguished Virgil. Their great merit consists in the\r\nremarkable neatness with which the sentiments are expressed, and the\r\nsweetness of the versification; their great defect is want of variety.\r\nThe subject necessarily limited the topics. The range of them is\r\nconfined to laments for the absence of the beloved object, the pangs of\r\njealousy, apprehensions of inconstancy, expressions of warm affection,\r\nand descriptions of the joys and sorrows of love.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Metamorphoses, the Epistles have been greater\r\nfavourites than any of the works of Ovid. Some were translated by\r\nDrayton and Lord Hervey. The beautiful translation, by Pope, of the\r\nepistle from Sappho to Phaon, is familiar to all; and his touching\r\npicture of the struggle between passion and principle, in the letter of\r\nEloisa to Abelard, owes a portion of its inspiration to the Epistles of\r\nOvid.\r\n\r\nLove in the days of Ovid had nothing in it chivalrous or pure—it was\r\ncarnal, sensual. The age in which he lived was morally polluted, and he\r\nwas neither better nor worse than his contemporaries. Great and noble as\r\nwas the character of the Roman matron, the charms of an accomplished\r\nfemale education were almost as rare as at Athens. She had sterling\r\nworth; but she had not often the power to fascinate those numbers who\r\nconsidered woman the minister to the pleasures of man. She was wise,\r\nself-sacrificing, patriotic, courageous—a devoted mother, an\r\naffectionate wife—and a man of heroic mould valued as she deserved such\r\na partner of his fortunes. But those who sought merely the allurements\r\nof passion looked only for meretricious pleasure and sensual enjoyment.\r\nHence grossness is the characteristic of Ovid’s Art of Love. The\r\ninstructions contained in the first two books, which are addressed to\r\nmen, are fit only for the seducer. The blandishments in the third are\r\nsuited only to the abandoned of the other sex.\r\n\r\nThe Art of Love was followed by the Remedies of Love, in one book: “Let\r\nhim,” he says, “who taught you to love, teach you also the cure; one\r\nhand shall inflict the wound and minister the balm. The earth produces\r\nnoxious and healthful herbs; the rose is often nearest neighbour to the\r\nnettle.”[751]\r\n\r\nHis Metamorphoses were just finished, and not yet corrected,[752] when\r\nhis fall took place. When in his despair he burnt it, fortunately for\r\nthe world some copies transpired. Afterwards he prayed that they might\r\nbe preserved to remind the readers of the unhappy author. The\r\nMetamorphoses consist of fifteen books, and contain a series of\r\nmythological narratives from the earliest times to the translation of\r\nthe soul of Julius Cæsar from earth to heaven, and his metamorphosis\r\ninto a star. This poem is Ovid’s noblest effort: it approaches as near\r\nto the epic form as is possible with so many naturally unconnected\r\nepisodes. In many parts, especially his descriptions, we do not merely\r\nadmire his natural facility in making verses, but picturesque\r\ntruthfulness and force—the richest fancy combined with grandeur and\r\ndignity. Amongst the most beautiful portions may be enumerated the story\r\nof Phaeton, including the splendid description of the Palace of the\r\nSun;[753] the golden age;[754] the story of Pyramus and Thisbe;[755] the\r\ncottage home and the rustic habits of Baucis and Philemon,[756]\r\nNarcissus at the fountain;[757] the powerfully sketched picture of the\r\nCave of Sleep,[758] Dædalus and Icarus,[759] Cephalus and Procris,[760]\r\nand the soliloquy of Medea.[761] In this poem, especially, may be traced\r\nthat study and learning by which the Roman poets made all the treasures\r\nof Greek literature their own. In fact, a more extensive knowledge of\r\nGreek mythology may be derived from it than from the Greeks themselves,\r\nbecause the books which were the sources of his information are\r\nunfortunately no longer extant.\r\n\r\nThe “Fasti” is an antiquarian poem on the Roman calendar. Originally it\r\nwas intended to have formed twelve books, one for each month of the\r\nyear, but only the first six were completed:[762]——\r\n\r\n              Sex ego Fastorum scripsi totidemque libellos\r\n              Cumque suo finem mense volumen habet.\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful specimen of simple narrative in verse, and displays\r\nmore than any of his works, his power of telling a story, without the\r\nslightest effort, in poetry as well as prose. As a profound study of\r\nGreek mythology and poetry had furnished the materials for his\r\nMetamorphoses and other poems, so in this he drew principally from the\r\nlegends which had been preserved by the old poets and annalists of his\r\nown country.\r\n\r\nThe five books of the Tristia and the four books of the Epistles from\r\nPontus were the outpourings of his sorrowful heart during the gloomy\r\nevening of his days. Without the brilliancy, the wit, and the genius,\r\nwhich beamed forth from his joyous spirit in the time of his prosperity,\r\nwithout the graceful and inspired querulousness of the ancient models,\r\nthey are, nevertheless, conceived in the spirit of the Greek elegy—they\r\nutter the voice of complaining, and deserve the Horatian epithet of\r\n_miserabiles_.[763] It was natural to him to give utterance to his hope\r\nand despair in song: he had sported like a gay insect in the sunshine of\r\nprosperity. He was too fragile, delicate, and effeminate to bear the\r\nstorm of adversity—his butterfly spirit was broken; but, with all his\r\nfaults, that broken heart was capable of the tenderest emotions, and his\r\nletter to his daughter Perilla[764] is full of purity and sweetness. The\r\ncarelessness of one who would not take the trouble to correct, and who\r\nwas conscious of his dangerous facility, is compensated for by the\r\ncommiseration which his natural complaints excite, and for the powerful\r\ndescriptions which occasionally enliven the monotony inseparable from\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\nHis minor poems consist of an elegiac poem, “Nux,” in which a nut-tree\r\nbewails its hard fate and the ill treatment which it receives; a long\r\nand bitter satire, entitled Ibis, on some enemy, or, perhaps, some\r\nfaithless friend; a poem on Cosmetics (Medicamina facici;[765]) another\r\non Fishing (Halieutica;[766]) and an address of condolence to Livia\r\nAugusta. None, however, of these last three are universally admitted to\r\nbe genuine. Other works which were the offspring of his prolific genius\r\nhave perished. During his exile he acquired sufficient knowledge of the\r\nGetan language to write some poems in it; and these were as popular with\r\nthe barbarians as his Latin works were at Rome. Lastly, he was the\r\nauthor of the Medea; a tragedy of which Quintilian says, that it shows\r\nof what grand works he was capable, if he had been willing to curb\r\ninstead of giving reins to the luxuriance of his genius.[767] Two lines\r\nonly are extant; but we can judge of the conception which he formed of\r\nthe character of Medea from the epistle in the “Heroides,” and her\r\neminently tragic soliloquy in the Metamorphoses.\r\n\r\nOvid was a voluptuary, but not a heartless one. The age in which he\r\nlived was as immoral as himself, and far more gross; he was, therefore,\r\nneither a corrupter nor a seducer. His poetry was popular, not only\r\nbecause of its beauty, but because it was in exact accordance with the\r\nspirit of the times. His wit was sometimes contrary to good taste, but\r\nit was not forced and unnatural. He was betrayed into the appearance,\r\nnot the reality of affectation, by a luxuriance which required pruning,\r\nfor which he had neither patience nor inclination. He stored himself\r\nwith the learning of the ancients, and caught their inspiration; but\r\ntheir severe taste was to him a trammel to which he was too self-willed\r\nand self-complacent to submit. The prevalent taste for elegiac poetry\r\npointed out the style which was suited to his caliber; for one cannot\r\nhelp feeling that his genius was incapable of mastering the gigantic\r\nproportions of a true epic, and, notwithstanding the favourable\r\ncriticism of Quintilian, of soaring to the sublimity of tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GRATIUS FALISCUS.\r\n\r\nThe Cynegetica of Gratius, commonly, though without any reason, surnamed\r\nFaliscus, may claim a place beside the Halieutica of Ovid, on account of\r\nits subject, but not on the score of genius, poetry, or language.\r\nNothing is known respecting this author, except that Ovid speaks of him\r\nas a contemporary.[768] The poem is heroic, and consists of 536 lines:\r\nits style is hard and prosaic; it describes the weapons and arts of the\r\nchase, horses and hounds; but the science is rather Greek than Italian,\r\nand the information contained in it is principally derived from\r\nXenophon.[769]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PEDO ALBINOVANUS.\r\n\r\nAnother poet of the Ovidian age was his trusty friend, C. Pedo\r\nAlbinovanus. He was of equestrian rank,[770] and, unlike most of his\r\ncontemporaries, an epic poet.[771] Ovid in his Epistles from\r\nPontus,[772] which are addressed to him, applies to him the epithet,\r\n“Sidereus,” either because he had written an astronomical poem, or\r\nbecause his sublime language soared into the starry heavens. Martial\r\nspeaks of him as having written epigrams which extend to the length of\r\ntwo pages.[773] A fragment of an epic poem, describing the voyage of\r\nGermanicus related by Tacitus, is preserved by Seneca.[774] Three\r\nelegies are usually ascribed to him; but their style is that of more\r\nmodern times, and the authority for their genuineness very suspicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              A. SABINUS.\r\n\r\nAnother contemporary of Ovid was A. Sabinus; and all that is known\r\nrespecting him is derived from two passages in the works of the former\r\npoet.[775] In one of these,[776] he tells us that Sabinus wrote answers\r\nto six of the epistles of the Heroides. None of these, however, are\r\nextant. The three which profess to be written by him, entitled Ulysses\r\nto Penelope, Demophoon to Phyllis, and Paris to Œnone, are the work of\r\nAngelus Sabinus,[777] a philologer and poet of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nTwo other works are attributed to him by Ovid in a passage in which he\r\nspeaks of his death.[778] One of these, entitled Trœzen, was probably an\r\nepic poem, of which Theseus was the hero;[779] the other, _Dierum Opus_,\r\nwas a continuation of Ovid’s Fasti. Other elegiac poets flourished at\r\nthis period, such as Proculus and Montanus; but their poetical talents\r\nwere of too commonplace a character to deserve special mention. They\r\nconfer no obligation on literature, and contribute nothing towards the\r\nillustration of the literary character of their times.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              M. MANILIUS.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical and astrological poem of Manilius furnishes a series of\r\nthose historical problems which have never yet been satisfactorily\r\nsolved. The author has been in turn confounded with every one whom Roman\r\nrecords mention as bearing that name, and in all cases with equally\r\nlittle reason. No one knows when he flourished, where he lived, and of\r\nwhat place he was a native. Bentley determined that he was an Asiatic;\r\nHuet that he was a Carthaginian. Internal evidence renders it most\r\nprobable that he lived in the reign of Tiberius;[780] and yet neither he\r\nnor his poem are ever mentioned by any ancient author. His work was\r\nnever discovered until the beginning of the fifteenth century; probably\r\nit had never been published, but only a few copies had been made, some\r\nof which have been marvellously preserved.\r\n\r\nThe philosophical principles of the poem are those of a Stoical\r\nPantheism. As one principle of life pervades the whole universe, there\r\nis a close connexion between things celestial and things terrestrial. In\r\nconsequence of this relation, the astrologer can determine the course of\r\nthe latter by observation of the heavenly bodies. Together with all the\r\nassumptions and absurdities of astrology are mingled extensive knowledge\r\nof the state of astronomical science in his day: gleams of truth shoot\r\nlike meteors athwart the darkness. The subject which he has chosen is as\r\nunpromising for poetical effect and embellishment as that of Lucretius;\r\nbut he does not handle it so successfully: he has neither the boldness\r\nof thought, the dignity of language, nor the imaginative grandeur which\r\nmarked the old poet philosopher. The poem is incomplete; and probably\r\nowes some of its roughness and obscurity to its never having been\r\ncorrected for publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n PROSE WRITERS—INFLUENCE OF CICERO UPON THE LANGUAGE—HIS CONVERSE WITH\r\n  HIS FRIENDS—HIS EARLY LIFE—PLEADS HIS FIRST CAUSE—IS QUÆSTOR, ÆDILE,\r\n PRÆTOR AND CONSUL—HIS EXILE, RETURN, AND PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION—HIS\r\n    VACILLATING CONDUCT—HE DELIVERS HIS PHILIPPICS—IS PROSCRIBED AND\r\n                      ASSASSINATED—HIS CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs oratory gave to Latin prose-writing its elegance and dignity, Cicero\r\nis not only the representative of the flourishing period of the\r\nlanguage, but also the instrumental cause of its arriving at perfection.\r\nCircumstances may have been favourable to his influence. The national\r\nmind may have been in that stage of progress which only required a\r\nmaster-genius to develop it; but still it was he who gave a fixed\r\ncharacter to the language, who showed his countrymen what eloquence\r\nespecially was in its combination of the precepts of art and the\r\nprinciples of natural beauty; what the vigour of Latin was, and of what\r\nelegance and polish it was capable.\r\n\r\nHis age was not an age of poetry; but he paved the way for poetry by\r\ninvesting the language with those graces which are indispensable to its\r\nperfection. He freed it from all coarseness and harshness, and\r\naccustomed the educated classes to use language, even in their every-day\r\nconversation, which never called up gross ideas, but was fit for pure\r\nand noble sentiments. Before his time, Latin was plain-spoken, and\r\ntherefore vigorous; but the penalty which was paid for this was, that it\r\nwas sometimes gross and even indecent. The conversational language of\r\nthe upper classes became in the days of Cicero in the highest degree\r\nrefined: it admitted scarcely an offensive expression. The truth of this\r\nassertion is evident from those of his writings which are of the\r\nfamiliar character—from his graphic Dialogues, in which he describes the\r\ncircumstances as naturally as if they really occurred; from his letters\r\nto Atticus, in which he lays open the secret thoughts of his heart to\r\nhis most intimate friend, his second self. Cicero purified the language\r\nmorally as well as æsthetically. It was the licentious wantonness of the\r\npoets which degraded the pleasures of the imagination by pandering to\r\nthe passions at first in language delicately veiled, and then by open\r\nand disgusting sensuality.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for us, perhaps, to whom religion comes under the aspect\r\nof revelation separate from philosophy, and who consider the\r\nphilosophical investigation of moral subjects as different from the\r\nreligious view of morals, to form an adequate conception of the pure and\r\nalmost holy nature of the conversations of Cicero and his distinguished\r\ncontemporaries. To them philosophy was the contemplation of the nature\r\nand attributes of the Supreme Being. The metaphysical analysis of the\r\ninternal nature of man was the study of immortality and the evidence for\r\nanother life. Cato, for example, read the Phædo of Plato in his last\r\nmoments in the same serious spirit in which the Christian would read the\r\nwords of inspiration. The study of ethics was that of the sanctions with\r\nwhich God has supported duty and enlightened the conscience. They were\r\nthe highest subjects with which the mind of man could be conversant. For\r\nmen to meet together, as was the habitual practice of Cicero and his\r\nfriends, and pass their leisure hours in such discussions, was the same\r\nas if Christians were to make the great truths of the gospel the\r\nsubjects of social converse.\r\n\r\nAgain, if we examine the character of their lighter conversations, when\r\nthey turned from philosophy to literature,—it was not mere gossip on the\r\npopular literature of the day—it was not even confined to works written\r\nin their native tongue—it embraced the whole field of the literature of\r\na foreign nation. They talked of poets, orators, philosophers, and\r\nhistorians, who were ancients to them as they are to us. They did not\r\nthen think the subject of a foreign and ancient literature dull or\r\npedantic. They did not consider it necessary that conversation should be\r\ntrifling or frivolous in order to be entertaining.\r\n\r\nNor was the influence which Cicero exercised on the literature of his\r\nday merely extensive, but it was permanent. The great men of whom he was\r\nthe leader and guide caught his spirit. His influence survived until\r\nexternal political causes destroyed eloquence, and its place was\r\nsupplied by a cold and formal rhetoric: it was felt almost until the\r\nlanguage was corrupted by the admixture of barbarisms. It may be\r\ndiscerned in the soldier-like plainness of Cæsar, in the Herodotean\r\nnarrative of Livy, and its sweetness without its diffuseness\r\noccasionally adorns the reflective pages of Tacitus.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult in a limited space to do justice to Cicero, even as a\r\nliterary man; such was his versatility of genius, such his indefatigable\r\nindustry, so vast the range of subjects which he touched and adorned. Of\r\ncourse, therefore, it is impossible to do more than rapidly glance at\r\nthe leading events of his political career, or at his public character,\r\nsince his history is, in fact, a history of his stirring and critical\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  M. TULLIUS CICERO (BORN B. C. 106.)\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the noiseless and gently-flowing[781] Liris\r\n(Garigliano,) near Arpinum, the birthplace of Marius,[782] lived a Roman\r\nknight named M. Tullius Cicero. A competent hereditary estate enabled\r\nhim to devote his time to literary pursuits. He had two sons: the elder,\r\nwho bore his father’s name, was born January 3rd, B. C. 106. The other,\r\nQuintus, was about four years younger. As both, and Marcus especially,\r\ndisplayed quick talents and a lively disposition, and gave promise of\r\ninheriting their father’s taste for learning, he migrated to Rome when\r\nMarcus was about fourteen years of age. The boys were educated with\r\ntheir cousins, the young Aculei.[783] Q. Ælius[784] taught them grammar;\r\nlearned Greeks instructed them in philosophy; and the poet Archias\r\nexercised them in the technical rules of verse, although he did not\r\nsucceed in giving them the inspiration of poetry. Quintus prided himself\r\non his poetic skill; and a poem by him, on the twelve zodiacal signs, is\r\nstill extant.[785] Cicero also had in his boyhood some poetical taste;\r\nand there is great elegance in the translations from the Greek which we\r\nmeet with in his works. He wrote a poem in hexameters, entitled “Pontius\r\nGlaucus,” as a sort of juvenile exercise, which was extant in the time\r\nof Plutarch; and also when he was a young man in praise of Marius.\r\n\r\nAfter assuming the toga virilis at sixteen years of age, M. T. Cicero\r\nattended the forum diligently; and, by carefully exercising himself in\r\ncomposition, made the eloquence of the celebrated orators whom he heard\r\nhis own, whilst from the lectures and advice of Q. Mucius Scævola, he\r\nacquired the principles of Roman jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nHe served but little in the armies of his country: his only\r\ncampaign[786] was made under the father of Pompey the Great in the\r\nsocial war. During the remainder of this period, Molo, the Rhodian\r\nrhetorician, instructed him in oratory, whilst Diodotus the Stoic,\r\nPhædrus the Epicurean, and Philo, who had presided over the New Academy\r\nat Athens, were his masters in philosophy. The various schools, the\r\nprinciples of which he thus imbibed, led to the eclecticism which\r\ncharacterizes his philosophical creed. The bloody era of the Marian and\r\nSullan war was passed by him in study: he did not interfere in politics,\r\nand the fruits of his retirement are extant in the treatise _de\r\nInventione Rhetorica_.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-five, he pleaded his first cause,[787] and in the following\r\nyear defended S. Roscius of Ameria; but his constitution was not strong\r\nenough to bear great exertion. His friends, therefore, induced him to\r\ntravel, and he determined to pass some time at Athens.[788] There was\r\nalso another reason for this recommendation. His courageous defence of\r\nRoscius had provoked the enmity of Chrysogonus, a creature of Sulla, and\r\nit was therefore dangerous for him to remain at Rome. He was accompanied\r\nby his brother Quintus,[789] and found Pomponius Atticus residing there,\r\nwho afterwards became his most intimate friend. From Athens he travelled\r\nto Asia and Rhodes, employing his time in the cultivation of oratory,\r\nhis principal study at Athens having been philosophy. From Asia he\r\nreturned to Rome[790] with improved health and an invigorated\r\nconstitution; where he found a powerful rival, as an orator, in\r\nHortensius, who was then at the zenith of his popularity.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was old enough,[791] he was elected quæstor, and the\r\nprovince of Sicily was allotted to him. In the exercise of this office,\r\nthe unusual mildness and integrity of his administration endeared him to\r\nthe provincials; whilst the judgment with which he regulated the\r\nsupplies of corn from the granary of Rome, gained him equal credit with\r\nhis fellow-countrymen. It was during his stay in Sicily that his love of\r\nantiquarianism was gratified by the discovery of the tomb of\r\nArchimedes.[792] On his return home[793] he resumed his forensic\r\npractice: and in B. C. 70 was the champion of his old friends, the\r\nSicilians, and impeached Verres, who had been prætor of Syracuse, for\r\noppression and maladministration. In the following year[794] he was\r\nelected curule ædile by a triumphant majority. In the celebration of the\r\ngames which belonged to the province of this magistrate, he exhibited\r\ngreat prudence by avoiding the lavish expenditure in which so many were\r\naccustomed to indulge, whilst, at the same time, no one could accuse him\r\nof meanness and illiberality.\r\n\r\nIn the year B. C. 67, he obtained the prætorship, and notwithstanding\r\nthe judicial duties of his office, defended Cluentius. Hitherto his\r\nspeeches had been entirely of the judicial kind. He now for the first\r\ntime distinguished himself as a deliberative orator, and supported the\r\nManilian law which conferred upon Pompey, to the discomfiture of the\r\naristocratic party, the command in chief of the Mithridatic war.\r\n\r\nThe great object of his ambition now was the consulship, which seemed\r\nalmost inaccessible to a _new man_. As all difficulties and prejudices\r\nwere on the side of the aristocratic party, his only hope of surmounting\r\nthem was by warmly espousing the cause of the people.\r\n\r\nCatiline and C. Antonius, who were his principal competitors, formed a\r\ncoalition, and were supported by Cæsar and Crassus, but the influence of\r\nPompey and the popular party prevailed; and Cicero and Antony were\r\nelected. He entered upon his office January 1, B. C. 63. At this period,\r\nperhaps, the moral qualities of his character are the highest, and his\r\ngenius shines forth with the brightest splendour.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy of Catiline was the great event of his consulship; a plot\r\nwhich its historian does not hesitate to dignify with the title of a\r\nwar. Yet this war was crushed in an unparalleled short space of time;\r\nand a splendid triumph was gained over so formidable an enemy, by one\r\nwho wore the peaceful _toga_, not the habiliments of a general. The\r\nprudence and tact of the civilian did as good service as the courage and\r\ndecision of the soldier. The applause and gratitude of his fellow\r\ncitizens were unbounded, and all united in hailing him the father of his\r\ncountry. One act alone laid him open to attack, and in fact eventually\r\ncaused his ruin. There is no doubt that it was unconstitutional,\r\nalthough under the circumstances it was defensible, perhaps scarcely to\r\nbe avoided. This act was the execution of Lentulus, Cethegus, and the\r\nother ringleaders, without sentence being passed upon them by the\r\ncomitia. The senate, seeing that the danger was imminent, had invested\r\nCicero and his colleague with power to do all that the exigencies of the\r\nstate might require (_videre ne quid res publica detrimenti caperet_;)\r\nand although it was Cicero who recommended the measure and argued in its\r\nfavour, it was the senate who pronounced the sentence, and assumed that,\r\nas traitors, the conspirators had forfeited their rights as citizens.\r\n\r\nThe grateful people saw this clearly; and when Metellus Celer, one of\r\nthe tribunes, would have prevented Cicero from giving an account of his\r\nadministration at the close of the consular year, he swore that he saved\r\nhis country, and his oath was confirmed by the acclamations of the\r\nmultitude. This was a great triumph; and in sadder times he looked back\r\nto it with a justifiable self-complacency.[795] He now, as though his\r\nmission was accomplished, refused all public dignities except that of a\r\nsenator: but he did not thus escape peril; he soon exposed himself to\r\nthe implacable vengeance of a powerful and unscrupulous enemy. The\r\ninfamous P. Clodius Pulcher intruded himself in female attire into the\r\nrites of the Bona Dea, which were celebrated in the house of Cæsar.\r\nSuspicion fell upon Cæsar’s wife, and a divorce was the\r\nconsequence.[796] Clodius was brought to trial on the charge of\r\nsacrilege, and pleaded an alibi. Cicero, however, proved his presence in\r\nRome on the very day on which the accused asserted that he was at\r\nInteramnum.\r\n\r\nAlthough the guilt of Clodius was fully established, his influence over\r\nthe corrupt Roman _judices_ was powerful enough to procure an acquittal.\r\nHenceforward he never could forgive Cicero, and determined to work his\r\nruin. He caused himself to be adopted in a plebeian family; and thus\r\nbecoming qualified for the tribunate was elected to that magistracy,\r\nB. C. 59. No sooner was he appointed, than he proposed a bill for the\r\noutlawry of any one who had caused the execution of a citizen without\r\ntrial. Cicero at once saw that this blow was aimed against himself. He\r\nhad disgusted Cæsar by his political coquetry; the false and selfish\r\nPompey refused to aid him in his trouble; and spirit-broken, he fled to\r\nBrundisium,[797] and thence to Thessalonica. He had an interview with\r\nPompey before his flight, but it led to no results.[798] He had sworn to\r\nhelp him as long as he felt that there was danger, lest he should join\r\nCæsar’s party; but when he saw that his foes were successful, he\r\ndeserted him.\r\n\r\nIn his absence his exile was decreed, and his town and country houses\r\nwere given up to plunder. It cannot be denied that during his banishment\r\nhe exhibited weakness and pusillanimity: his reverses had such an effect\r\nupon his mind that he was even supposed to be mad.[799] His great fault\r\nwas vanity, of which defect he was himself conscious, and confessed\r\nit;[800] and disappointed vanity was the cause of his affliction. He\r\ncould bear anything better than loss of popular applause; and on this\r\noccasion, more than any other, he gave grounds for the assertion, that\r\n“he bore none of his calamities like a man, except his death.” Rome,\r\nhowever, could not forget her preserver; and in the following year he\r\nwas recalled, and entered Rome in triumph, in the midst of the loud\r\nplaudits of the assembled people.[801] Still, however, he was obliged to\r\nsecure the prosperity which he had recovered by political\r\ntergiversation. The measures of the triumvirate, which he had formerly\r\nattacked with the utmost virulence, he did not hesitate now to approve\r\nand defend.\r\n\r\nAfter his return[802] he was appointed to a seat in the College of\r\nAugurs; a dignity which he had anxiously coveted before his exile, and\r\nto obtain which, he had offered almost any terms to Cæsar and\r\nPompey.[803] The following year, much against his will, the province of\r\nCilicia was assigned to him. Strictly did the accuser of Verres act up\r\nto the high and honourable principles which he professed. His was a\r\nmodel administration: a stop was put to corruption, wrongs were\r\nredressed, justice impartially administered. Those great occasions on\r\nwhich he was compelled to act on his own responsibility, and to listen\r\nto the dictates of his beautiful soul, “_seine schöne seele_,”[804] his\r\npure, honest, and incorruptible heart, are the bright points in Cicero’s\r\ncareer. The emergency of the occasion overcame his constitutional\r\ntimidity.\r\n\r\nIn the year B. C. 49, he returned to Rome, and finding himself in a\r\nposition in which he could calmly observe the current of affairs, and\r\ndetermine unbiassed what part he should take in them, or whether it was\r\nhis duty to take any part at all, his weak, wavering, vacillating temper\r\nagain got the mastery over him. He would not do anything dishonest, but\r\nhe was not chivalrous enough to spurn at once that which was\r\ndishonourable. Cæsar and Pompey were now at open war, and he could not\r\nmake up his mind which to join.[805] He felt, probably, that the energy,\r\nability, and firmness of Cæsar, would be crowned with success; and yet\r\nhis friends, his party, and his own heart were with Pompey, and he\r\ndreaded the scorn which would be heaped upon him if he forsook his\r\npolitical opinions. His were not the stern, unyielding principles of a\r\nCato; but the fear of what men would say of him made him anxious and\r\nmiserable. The struggle was a long one between caution and honour, but\r\nat length honour overcame caution. He made his decision, and went to the\r\ncamp of Pompey; but he could never rally his spirits, or feel sanguine\r\nas to the result. He immediately saw that Pharsalia decided the question\r\nfor ever, and consequently hastened to Brundisium, where he awaited the\r\nreturn of the conqueror. It was a long time to remain in suspense; but\r\nat last the generous Cæsar relieved him from it by a full and free\r\npardon.\r\n\r\nAnd now again his character rose higher, and his good qualities had room\r\nto display themselves. There were no longer equally balanced parties to\r\nrevive the discord which formerly distracted his mind, nor were the\r\ncircumstances of the times such as to demand his active interference in\r\nthe cause of his country; but he was as great in the exercise of his\r\ncontemplative faculties as he had been in the brightest period of his\r\npolitical life. The same faults may, perhaps, be discerned in his\r\nphilosophical speculations: the same indecision which rendered him\r\nincapable of being a statesman or a patriot caused him to adopt in\r\nphilosophy a skeptical eclecticism. Truth was to him as variable as\r\npolitical honesty; but he is always the advocate and supporter of\r\nresignation, and fortitude, and purity, and virtue.\r\n\r\nHe had hitherto suffered as a public man: he was now bowed down by\r\ndomestic affliction. A quarrel with his wife Terentia ended in a\r\ndivorce:[806] such was the facility with which at Rome the nuptial tie\r\ncould be severed. His second wife was his own ward—a young lady of large\r\nfortune; but disparity of years and temper prevented this connexion from\r\nlasting long. In B. C. 45 he lost his daughter Tullia. The blow was\r\noverwhelming: he sought in vain to soothe his grief in the woody\r\nsolitudes of his maritime villa at Astura, and it was long before the\r\nbereaved father found consolation in philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe political crisis which ensued upon the assassination of Cæsar\r\nalarmed him for his own personal safety: he therefore meditated a voyage\r\nto Greece; but being wind-bound at Rhegium, the hopes of an\r\naccommodation between Antony and the senate (a hope destined not to be\r\nrealized) induced him to return. Antony now left Rome, and Cicero\r\ndelivered that torrent of indignant and eloquent invective—his twelve\r\nPhilippic orations.[807] He was again the popular idol—crowds of\r\napplauding and admiring fellow-citizens attended him to the Forum in a\r\nkind of triumphant procession, as they had on his return from exile. But\r\nsoon the second triumvirate was formed. Each member readily gave up\r\nfriends to satisfy the vengeance of his colleagues, and Octavius\r\nsacrificed Cicero.\r\n\r\nThe story of his death is a brief and sad one. He was enjoying the\r\nliterary retirement of his Tusculan villa when his friends warned him of\r\nhis approaching fate. He was too great a philosopher to fear death; but\r\ntoo high-principled and resigned to the Divine will to commit suicide.\r\nStill he scarcely thought life worth preserving: “I will die,” he said,\r\n“in my fatherland, which I have so often saved.” However, at the\r\nentreaty of his brother, to whom he was affectionately attached, he\r\nendeavoured to escape. He first went across the country to Astura, and\r\nthere embarked. The weather was tempestuous, and as he suffered much\r\nfrom sea-sickness, he again landed at Gaëta. A treacherous freedman\r\nbetrayed him, and as he was being carried in a litter he was overtaken\r\nby his pursuers. He would not permit his attendants to make any\r\nresistance; but patiently and courageously submitted to the sword of the\r\nassassins, who cut off his head and hands and carried them to Antony. A\r\nsavage joy sparkled in the eyes of the triumvir at the sight of these\r\nbloody trophies. His wife, Fulvia, gloated with inhuman delight upon the\r\npallid features, and in petty spite pierced with a needle that once\r\neloquent tongue. The head and hands were fixed upon the rostrum which\r\nhad so often witnessed his unequalled eloquence. All that passed by\r\nbewailed his death, and gave vent to their affectionate feelings.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is impossible to be blind to the numerous faults of Cicero,\r\nfew men have been more maligned and misrepresented, and the judgment of\r\nantiquity has been, upon the whole, generally unfavourable. He was vain,\r\nvacillating, inconstant, constitutionally timid, and the victim of a\r\nmorbid sensibility; but he was candid, truthful, just, generous,\r\npure-minded, and warm-hearted. His amiability, acted upon by timidity,\r\nled him to set too high a value on public esteem and favour; and this\r\nweakened his moral sense and his instinctive love of virtue. That he\r\npossessed heroism is proved by his defence of Roscius, although the\r\nfavourite of the terrible Sulla was his adversary. He was not entirely\r\ndestitute of decision, or he would not so promptly have expressed his\r\napprobation of Cæsar’s assassins as tyrannicides. He had resolution to\r\nstrive against his over-sensitiveness, and wisdom to see that mental\r\noccupation was its best remedy; for in the midst of the distractions and\r\nanxieties of that eventful and critical year which preceded the\r\nconsulship of Hirtius and Pansa an almost incredible number of works\r\nproceeded from his pen.[808]\r\n\r\nThere are many circumstances to account for his political inconsistency\r\nand indecision. He had an early predilection for the aristocratic party;\r\nbut he saw that they were narrow-minded and behind their age. All the\r\npatricians, except Sulla and his small party, were on the popular side.\r\nHe was proud of his connexion with Marius; and his friend Sulpicius\r\nRufus, whom he greatly admired, joined the Marians. For these reasons,\r\nCicero was inconsistent as a politician. Again, during periods of\r\nrevolutionary turbulence, moderate men are detested by both sides; and\r\nyet it was impossible for a philosophic temper, which could calmly and\r\ndispassionately weigh the merits and demerits of both, to sympathize\r\nwarmly with either. Cicero saw that both were wrong: he was too\r\ntemperate to approve, too honest to pretend a zeal which he did not\r\nfeel, and, therefore, he was undecided.\r\n\r\nAgain, having a large benevolence, and a firm faith in virtue, he was\r\nunconscious of guile himself, and thought no evil of others. He\r\ntherefore mistook flattery for sincerity, and compliments for kindness.\r\nHe was vain; but vanity is a weakness not inconsistent with great minds,\r\nand in the case of Cicero it was fed by the unanimous voice of public\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\nAs an advocate his delight was to defend, not to accuse.[809] In three\r\nonly of his twenty-four orations did he undertake the office of an\r\naccuser.\r\n\r\nGentle, sympathizing, and affectionate, he lived as a patriot and died\r\nas a philosopher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n    CICERO NO HISTORIAN—HIS ORATORICAL STYLE DEFENDED—ITS PRINCIPAL\r\n   CHARM—OBSERVATIONS ON HIS FORENSIC ORATION—HIS ORATORY ESSENTIALLY\r\n   JUDICIAL—POLITICAL ORATIONS—RHETORICAL TREATISES—THE OBJECT OF HIS\r\n       PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS—CHARACTERISTICS OF ROMAN PHILOSOPHICAL\r\n    LITERATURE—PHILOSOPHY OF CICERO—HIS POLITICAL WORKS—LETTERS—HIS\r\n                         CORRESPONDENTS—VARRO.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the life and character of Cicero. The place which he occupies\r\nin a history of Roman literature is that of an orator and philosopher.\r\nIt has been already stated that he had some taste for poetry: in fact,\r\nwithout imagination he could scarcely have been so eminent as an orator;\r\nbut though the power which he wielded over prose was irresistible, he\r\nhad not fancy enough to give a poetical character to the language.\r\n\r\nNor had he, notwithstanding the versatility of his talents, any taste\r\nfor historical investigation. He delighted to read the Greek historians,\r\nfor the same purpose for which he studied the Attic orators, merely as\r\nan instrument of intellectual cultivation; but he was ignorant of Roman\r\nhistory, because he took no interest in original research. His\r\ncountrymen[810] expected from him an historical work, but he was unfit\r\nfor the task. It is plain from his “_Republic_,” how little he knew as\r\nan antiquarian.\r\n\r\nThe greatest praise of an orator’s style is to say that he was\r\nsuccessful. The end and object of oratory is to convince and persuade—to\r\nrivet the attention of the hearer, and to gain a mastery over the minds\r\nof men. If, therefore, any who study the speeches of Cicero in the\r\ncloset find faults in his style, they must remember the very faults\r\nthemselves were suited to the object which he was carrying into\r\nexecution. During the process of raising the public taste to the highest\r\nstandard, he carried his hearers with him: he was not too much in\r\nadvance; he did not aim his shafts too high; they hit the head and\r\nheart. Senate, judges, people understood his arguments, and felt his\r\npassionate appeals. Compared with the dignified energy and majestic\r\nvigour of the Athenian orator, the Asiatic exuberance of some of his\r\norations may be fatiguing to the sober and chastened taste of the modern\r\nclassical scholar; but in order to form a just appreciation, he must\r\ntransport himself mentally to the excitements of the thronged Forum—to\r\nthe senate composed, not of aged, venerable men, but statesmen and\r\nwarriors in the prime of life, maddened with the party spirit of\r\nrevolutionary times—to the presence of the jury of _judices_, as\r\nnumerous as a deliberative assembly, whose office was not merely calmly\r\nto give their verdict of guilty or not guilty, but who were invested as\r\nrepresentatives of the sovereign people with the prerogative of\r\npardoning or condemning.\r\n\r\nViewed in this light, his most florid passages will appear free from\r\naffectation—the natural flow of a speaker carried away with the torrent\r\nof his enthusiasm. The melodious rise and fall of his periods are not\r\nthe result of studied effect, but of a true and musical ear.\r\nUndoubtedly, amongst his earlier orations, are to be found passages\r\nsomewhat too declamatory and inconsistent with the principles which he\r\nafterwards laid down when his taste was more matured, and when he\r\nundertook to write scientifically on the theory of eloquence. Nor must\r\nit be concealed that some of the staid and stern Romans of his own days\r\nwere daring enough, notwithstanding his popularity and success, to find\r\nthe same fault with him. “Suorum temporum homines,” says Quintilian,\r\n“incessere audebant eum ut tumidiorem et Asianum[811] et redundantem et\r\nin repetitionibus nimium et in salibus aliquando frigidum et in\r\ncompositione fractum et exsultantem et pene viro molliorem.”\r\n\r\nBut it is not only the brilliance and variety of expression, and the\r\nfinely-modulated periods, which constituted the principal charm of\r\nCiceronian oratory, and rendered it so effective. Its effectiveness was\r\nmainly owing to the great orator’s knowledge of the human heart, and of\r\nthe national peculiarities of his countrymen. Its charm was owing to his\r\nextensive acquaintance with the stores of literature and philosophy,\r\nwhich his sprightly wit moulded at will, to the varied learning which\r\nhis unpedantic mind made so pleasant and popular, to his fund of\r\nillustration at once interesting and convincing. Even if his knowledge,\r\nbecause it spread over so wide a surface, was superficial, in this case\r\nprofoundness was unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn a work like the present it is only possible to devote a few brief\r\nobservations to the most important of his numerous orations, in which,\r\naccording to the criticism of Quintilian, he combined the force of\r\nDemosthenes, the copiousness of Plato, and the elegance of Isocrates.\r\nKnowledge of law, far superior to that possessed by the great orators of\r\nthe day,[812] distinguishes his earliest extant oration, the defence of\r\nP. Quinctius.[813] Hortensius was the defendant’s counsel. Nævius, the\r\ndefendant, who had unjustly possessed himself of the property of the\r\nplaintiff’s deceased brother, was a deserter from the Marians, and\r\ntherefore a protégé of Sylla; but, notwithstanding these disadvantages,\r\nCicero gained his cause. In the masterly defence of S. Roscius,[814]\r\nCicero again defied Sulla. His client was accused of parricide: there\r\nwas not a shadow of proof, and Cicero saved the life of an innocent man.\r\nThe noble enthusiasm with which he inveighs against tyranny in this\r\noration strikingly contrasts with the language, full of sweetness, in\r\nwhich he describes Roman rural life. The passage on parricide was too\r\nglowing and Asiatic for the taste of his maturer years, and he did not\r\nhesitate to make it the subject of severe criticism.[815] Passing over\r\nspeeches of less interest, we come to the six celebrated Verrian\r\norations. Of these _chefs-d’œuvre_ the first only was delivered.[816]\r\nThe others were merely published; for the voluntary exile of the\r\ncriminal rendered further pleading unnecessary. The first is entitled\r\n“_Divinatio_,” _i. e._, an inquiry as to who should have the right of\r\nprosecuting: Cæcilius, who had been quæstor to the accused, claimed this\r\nprivilege, wishing to make the suit a friendly one, and thus quash the\r\nproceedings. Nothing can surpass the ironical and sarcastic exposure of\r\nthis fraudulent attempt to defeat the ends of justice. The noble\r\npassages in the succeeding orations of the series are well known; the\r\nsketch of the wicked proconsul’s antecedent career; the graceful eulogy\r\nof that province, in the welfare of which Cicero himself felt so warm an\r\ninterest; the tasteful description of the statues and antiquities which\r\ntempted the more than Roman cupidity of Verres; the interesting history\r\nof ancient art which accompanies it; the burst of pathetic indignation\r\nwith which he paints the horrible tortures to which not only the\r\nprovincials, but even Roman citizens, were exposed. Transports of joy\r\npervaded the whole of Sicily at Cicero’s success; and the Sicilians\r\ncaused a medal to be struck with this inscription—“PROSTRATO VERRE\r\nTRINACRIA.” The oration for Fonteius[817] is a skilful defence of an\r\nunpopular governor; that in defence of Cluentius[818] is one of the most\r\nremarkable _causes célèbres_ of antiquity; and the complicated scene of\r\nvillany which Cicero’s forcible and soul-harrowing language paints,\r\nmakes one shudder with horror, whilst we are struck with admiration at\r\nthe clearness of intellect with which he unravels the web of guilt woven\r\nby Oppianicus and Sassia. This remarkable oration has been analyzed by\r\nDr. Blair.[819]\r\n\r\nAgain, passing over other forensic orations, we come to that on which he\r\nhad evidently expended all his resources of art, taste, and skill—the\r\nspeech for the poet Archias.[820] If possible it is even too elaborate\r\nand polished for so graceful a theme. Although the object of the\r\nadvocate was simply to establish the right of his client to Roman\r\ncitizenship, the genius of the poet of Antioch furnished an opportunity\r\nnot to be neglected for digressing into the fields of literature, and\r\nfor pronouncing a truly academical eulogium on poetry. It is\r\nsatisfactory to the admirers of Cicero to find that the attack which has\r\nbeen made on the genuineness of this pleasing oration is groundless and\r\nunwarrantable.[821]\r\n\r\nThe oration _pro Cælio_[822] is the most entertaining in the whole\r\ncollection. It contains a rich fund of anecdote, seasoned with witty\r\nobservations; a knowledge of human nature illustrated in a piquant and\r\nhumorous style, expressed in a tone of most gentlemanlike yet playful\r\neloquence, and interspersed with passages of great beauty. It presents a\r\nmarked contrast to the coarse personal abuse which defaces the otherwise\r\npowerful invective against L. Piso, which was delivered in the following\r\nyear.[823]\r\n\r\nThe list, though many more marvellous specimens are omitted, must be\r\nclosed with the oration in defence of T. Annius Milo. On this occasion\r\nCicero lost his wonted self-possession. When the court opened, Pompey\r\nwas presiding on the bench, and he had caused the Forum to be occupied\r\nwith soldiers. The sight, added, perhaps, to the consciousness that he\r\nwas advocating a bad cause, struck Cicero with alarm; his voice\r\ntrembled, his tongue refused to give utterance to the conceptions which\r\nhe had formed. The judges were unmoved; and Milo remained in his\r\nself-imposed exile at Marseilles. When Cicero left the court his courage\r\nand calmness returned. He penned the oration which is now extant. He had\r\nlittle or no proof or evidence to offer, and therefore, as an\r\nargumentative work, it is unconvincing; but for force, pathos, and the\r\nexternals of eloquence, it deserves to be reckoned amongst his most\r\nwonderful efforts. When the exiled Milo read it, he is said to have\r\nexclaimed, “O, Cicero, if you had pleaded so, I should not be eating\r\nsuch capital fish here!” The author himself and his contemporaries\r\nthought this his finest oration; probably its deficiencies were\r\nconcealed by its eloquence and ingenuity. It appears that the oration\r\nwhich he actually delivered was taken down in writing by reporters, and\r\nwas extant in the time of Asconius Pedianus, the most ancient\r\ncommentator on Cicero’s orations.[824] Its feebleness proved the\r\ncorrectness of the judgment of antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe oratory of Cicero was essentially judicial: he was himself conscious\r\nthat his talents lay in that direction, and he saw that in that field\r\nwas the best opportunity for displaying oratorical power. Even his\r\npolitical orations are rather judicial than deliberative. He was not\r\nborn for a politician. He possessed not that analytical character of\r\nmind which penetrates into the remote causes of human action, nor the\r\nsynthetical power which enables a man to follow them out to their\r\nfarthest consequences; he had not that comprehensive grasp of mind which\r\ncan dismiss at once all points of minor importance and useless\r\nspeculation, and, seizing all the salient points, can bring them to bear\r\ntogether upon questions of practical expediency. Of the three qualities\r\nnecessary for a statesman he possessed only two, honesty and patriotism:\r\nhe had not political wisdom.\r\n\r\nHence, in the finest specimens of his political harangues, his\r\nCatilinarians and Philippics, and that in support of the Manilian law,\r\nwe look in vain for the calm, practical weighing of the subject which is\r\nnecessary in addressing a deliberative assembly. This was not the habit\r\nof his mind. He was only lashed to action by circumstances of great\r\nemergency; but even then he is still an advocate—all is excitement,\r\npersonal feeling, and party spirit: he deals in invective and panegyric,\r\nand the denunciation of the enemies of his country; and the parts which\r\nespecially call forth our admiration differ in nothing from those which\r\nwe admire in his judicial orations. Nevertheless, so irresistible was\r\nthe influence which he exercised upon the minds of his hearers, that all\r\nhis political speeches were triumphs. His panegyric on Pompey,[825] in\r\nthe speech for the Manilian law, carried his appointment as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the armies of the East. The consequence of the\r\noration _de Provinciis Consularibus_ continued to Cæsar his\r\nadministration of Gaul. He crushed in Catiline one of the most\r\nformidable traitors that had ever menaced the safety of the republic.\r\nAntony’s fall followed the complete exposure of his debauchery in\r\nprivate life, and the factiousness of his public career.[826]\r\n\r\nOf the Catilinarians, the first and fourth were delivered in the senate,\r\nthe second and third in the presence of the people. Every one knows the\r\nburst of indignation which the consul, rising in his place, aims at the\r\naudacious conspirator who dared to pollute with his presence the temple\r\nof the deity, and the most august assembly of the Roman people. In less\r\nthan twenty-four hours Catiline had left Rome, and the conspiracy had\r\nbecome a war. In four words Cicero announced this to the assembled\r\nRomans the day after he had addressed the senate. The third is a piece\r\nof self-complacent but pardonable egotism. Success has overwhelmed\r\nhim—he sees that all eyes are turned upon himself—he is the hero of his\r\nown story; still he demands no reward but the approbation of his\r\nfellow-citizens, and reminds them that to the gods alone their gratitude\r\nis due.\r\n\r\nTwo days pass away, and after Cæsar and Cicero had spoken, Cicero again\r\naddresses the senate, and recommends that measure which was the\r\nbeginning of his troubles, the condemnation of the conspirators. The\r\nzeal of the senate made the act their own, but Cicero paid the penalty.\r\nThe position which Cicero occupies on this occasion invests his speech\r\nwith more dignity than is displayed in any of the preceding. He is the\r\nchief magistrate of the republic, performing the duty of pronouncing a\r\ncapital sentence on the guilty. The excitement of the crisis is\r\nsubsiding; and he has the more composure, because he knows that he\r\ncarries with him the sympathies of the senate and people.\r\n\r\nThe Philippics, so named after the orations of Demosthenes, are fourteen\r\nin number. Cicero commenced his attack[827] upon the object of his\r\nimplacable hatred with a defence of the laws of Cæsar, which Antony\r\nwished to repeal. He followed it up with the celebrated second oration,\r\nin which he demolished the character of Antony; a speech which Juvenal\r\npronounced to be his _chef-d’œuvre_, but which Niebuhr thought was\r\nundeserving of being so highly exalted. He delivered the remaining\r\ntwelve in the course of the succeeding year; they were the last\r\nmonuments of his eloquence; he never spoke again. The fourteenth is a\r\nbrilliant panegyric, but nothing more; the gallant army of Octavius\r\nreceived their deserved applause; but in this political crisis the\r\norator could not discern or even catch a glimpse of the future destinies\r\nof his country.\r\n\r\nIn his rhetorical works, Cicero left a legacy of practical instruction\r\nto posterity. The treatise “_De Inventione_,” although it displays\r\ngenius, is merely interesting as the juvenile production of a future\r\ngreat man; and the author himself alludes to it as a rude and unfinished\r\nproduction.[828] Of the Rhetorical Hand-Book, in four sections,\r\naddressed to Herennius, it is unnecessary to speak, as it is now\r\nuniversally pronounced spurious.[829] The _De Oratore_, _Brutus sive de\r\nclaris Oratoribus_, and _Orator ad M. Brutum_,[830] are the result of\r\nhis matured experience. They form together one series; the principles\r\nare first laid down; their developments are carried out and illustrated;\r\nand lastly, in the _Orator_, he places before the eyes of Brutus the\r\nmodel of ideal perfection. In his treatment of this subject, he shows a\r\nmind imbued with the spirit of Plato: he invests it with dramatic\r\ninterest, and transports the reader into the scene which he so\r\ngraphically describes. The conversation contained in the first of these\r\nworks has been already described. The scene of the second is laid on the\r\nlawn of Cicero’s palace at Rome: Cicero, Atticus and M. Brutus are the\r\n_dramatis personæ_; and their taste receives inspiration from a statue\r\nof Plato which adorns the garden. In the third, Cicero himself, at the\r\nrequest of M. Brutus, paints, as Plato would have done, the portrait of\r\na faultless orator.\r\n\r\nThree more short treatises must be added—(1.) The dialogue, _De\r\nPartitione Oratoria_,[831] an elementary book, written for his son. (2.)\r\nThe _De Optimo Genere Oratorum_,[832] a short preface to a translation\r\nof the Greek oration, _De Corona_. (3.) The _Topica_,[833] _i. e._, a\r\ntreatise on the commonplaces of judicial oratory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PHILOSOPHY OF CICERO.\r\n\r\nCicero somewhat arrogantly claims the credit of being the first to\r\nawaken a taste for philosophy, and to illuminate the darkness in which\r\nit lay hid by the light of Roman letters.[834] He did not confess the\r\nobligations under which he lay to his predecessors, because he never\r\ncould forget that he was an orator.[835] He could not deny that some of\r\nthem thought justly; but he denied that they possessed the power of\r\nexpressing what they thought. He felt that there was nothing in the\r\nphilosophical writings already existing to tempt his countrymen to study\r\nthe subject: they were dry, unadorned, unpolished. It required an orator\r\nto array philosophy in an enticing garb. He proposed, therefore, to\r\nassuage his anxieties—to seek repose from the harassing cares of\r\npolitics[836]—by rendering his countrymen independent of Greek\r\nphilosophical literature.\r\n\r\nThis was all he proposed to himself: it was all that his predecessor had\r\nattempted; nor did he pretend to originality. The periods which he\r\ndevoted to the task, and to which all philosophical works belong, were\r\nthose during which he was excluded from political life. The first of\r\nthese was the triumvirate of Cæsar, Pompey, and Crassus; the second was\r\ncoincident with the dictatorship of Cæsar and the consulship of Antony.\r\nNot only did his contemplative spirit delight in such studies, but,\r\nwhilst all the avenues to distinction were closed against him, his\r\nambition sought this road to fame, and his patriotism urged him to take\r\nthis method of benefiting his country. But as he was not the first who\r\nintroduced philosophy to the Romans, it will be necessary briefly to\r\nsketch its progress up to the time at which his labours commenced.\r\n\r\nRoman philosophy was neither the result of original investigation nor\r\nthe gradual development of the Greek system. It arose rather from a\r\nstudy of ancient philosophical literature than from an examination of\r\nphilosophical principles. The Roman intellect did not possess the power\r\nof abstraction in a sufficiently high degree for research, nor was the\r\nLatin language capable of representing satisfactorily abstract thoughts.\r\nCicero was quite aware of the poverty of its scientific nomenclature, as\r\ncompared with that of Greece. In one treatise,[837] he writes,—“Equidem\r\nsoleo etiam, quod uno Græci, si aliter non possum, idem pluribus verbis\r\nexprimere.” Pliny[838] and Seneca[839] assert the same fact. “Magis\r\ndamnabis,” writes the latter, “angustias Romanas si scieris unam\r\nsyllabam esse, quam mutare non possim. Quæ hæc sit quæris? το ον.” The\r\npractical character also of the people prompted them to take advantage\r\nof the material already furnished by others, and to select such\r\ndoctrines as it approved, without regard to their relation to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe Roman philosopher, therefore, or rather (to speak more correctly)\r\nphilosophical student, did not throw himself into the speculations of\r\nhis age, pursue them contemporaneously, or deduce from them fresh\r\nresults. He went back to the earlier ages of Greek philosophy, studied,\r\ncommented on, and explained the works of the best authors, and adopted\r\nsome of their doctrines as fixed scholastic dogmas. Consequently, the\r\nspirit in which philosophical study was pursued by the Romans was a\r\nliterary and not a scientific one. A taste for literature had been\r\nawakened, and philosophy was considered only as one species of\r\nliterature, although its importance was recognised as bearing upon the\r\npractical duties, the highest interests and happiness of man. The\r\npractical view which Cicero took of philosophy, and the extensive\r\ninfluence which he attributed to it, is manifest from numerous passages\r\nin his works,[840] and is imbodied in the following beautiful apostrophe\r\nin the Tusculan Disputations:[841] “O vitæ Philosophia dux! O virtutis\r\nindagatrix, expultrixque vitiorum! Quid non modo nos, sed omnino vita\r\nhominum sine te esse potuisset? Tu urbes peperisti; tu dissipatos\r\nhomines in societatem vitæ convocasti; tu eos inter se primo domiciliis,\r\ndeinde conjugiis, tum literarum et vocum communione junxisti; tu\r\ninventrix legum, tu magistra morum et disciplinæ fuisti; ad te\r\nconfugimus, a te opem petimus; tibi nos, ut antea magna ex parte, sic\r\nnunc penitus totosque tradimus.”\r\n\r\nIt is plain, therefore, that the chief characteristics of Roman\r\nphilosophy would be—(1.) Learning, for it consisted in bringing together\r\ndoctrines and opinions scattered over a wide field; (2,) Generally\r\nspeaking, an ethical purpose and object, for Romans would be little\r\ninclined to value any subject of study which had no ultimate reference\r\nto man’s political and social relations; (3,) Eclecticism; for although\r\nthere were certain schools, such as the Epicurean and Stoic, which were\r\nevidently favourites, the dogmas of different teachers were collected\r\nand combined together often without regard to consistency.\r\n\r\nThe defects of such a system are fatal to its claim to be considered\r\nphilosophical; for the scientific connexion of its parts is lost sight\r\nof, and results are presented independent of the chain of causes and\r\neffects by which they are connected with principles. Such a system must\r\nnecessarily be illogical and inconsequential. Even the liberality which\r\nadopts the principle, “Nullius jurare in verba magistri,” and which,\r\ntherefore, appears to be its chief merit, was absurd; and the\r\nwillingness with which all views were readily admitted led to\r\nskepticism, or doubt whether such a thing as absolute truth had a real\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nGreek philosophy was probably first introduced into Rome by the Achæan\r\nexiles, of whom Polybius was one.[842] The embassy of Carneades the\r\nAcademic, Diogenes the Stoic, and Critolaus the Peripatetic, followed\r\nsix years afterwards. In vain the stern M. Porcius Cato caused their\r\ndismissal; for some of the most illustrious and accomplished Romans,\r\nsuch as Africanus, Lælius, and Furius, had already profited by their\r\nlectures and instructions.[843] Whilst the educated Romans were gaining\r\nan historical insight into the doctrines of these schools, the Stoic\r\nPanætius, who was entertained in the household of Scipio Africanus, was\r\nunfolding the mysterious and transcendental doctrines of the great\r\nobject of his veneration, Plato. But although the Romans could\r\nappreciate the majestic dignity and poetical beauty of his style, they\r\nwere not equal to the task of penetrating his hidden meaning; they were,\r\ntherefore, content to take upon trust the glosses and commentaries of\r\nhis expositors. These inclined to the New Academy rather than to the\r\nOld: in its skeptical spirit they compared and balanced opposing\r\nprobabilities; and went no farther than recommending the adoption of\r\nopinions upon which they could not pronounce with certainty. Neither did\r\nthe Peripatetic doctrines meet with much favour, although the works of\r\nAristotle had been brought to Rome by the dictator Sulla, partly, as\r\nCicero says, because of the vastness of the subjects treated, partly\r\nbecause they seemed incapable of satisfactory proof to unskilled and\r\ninexperienced minds.[844]\r\n\r\nThe philosophical system which first arrested the attention of the\r\nRomans, and gained an influence over their minds, was the\r\nEpicurean.[845] But it is somewhat remarkable that, although this\r\nphilosophy was in its general character ethical, a people so eminently\r\npractical in their turn of mind should have especially devoted\r\nthemselves to the study of the physical speculations of this\r\nschool.[846] The only apparent exception to this statement is Catius,\r\nbut even his principal works, although he wrote one, “_de Summo Bono_,”\r\nare on the physical nature of things.[847]\r\n\r\nCicero accounts for the popularity of Epicureanism by saying that it was\r\neasy—that it appealed to the blandishments of pleasure; and that its\r\nfirst professors, Amafanius and Rabirius, used none of the refinements\r\nof art or subtleties or dialectic, but clothed their discussions in a\r\nhomely and popular style, suited to the simple and unlearned. There were\r\nmany successors to Amafanius; and the doctrines which they taught\r\nrapidly spread over the whole of Italy. Many illustrious statesmen,\r\nalso, were amongst the believers in this fashionable creed; of whom the\r\nbest known are C. Cassius, the fellow-conspirator of Brutus, and T.\r\nPomponius Atticus, the friend of Cicero. All the monuments and records,\r\nhowever, of the Epicurean philosophy, which were published in Latin,\r\nhave perished, with the exception of the immortal work of T. Lucretius\r\nCarus, “De Naturâ Rerum.”\r\n\r\nNor was Stoicism, the severe principles of which were in harmony with\r\nthe stern old Roman virtues, without distinguished disciples; such as\r\nwere the unflinching M. Brutus, the learned Terentius Varro, the jurist\r\nScævola, the unbending Cato of Utica, and the magnificent Lucullus—a\r\nStoic in creed, though not in life and conduct. The part which Cicero’s\r\ncharacter qualified him to perform in the philosophical instruction of\r\nhis countrymen was scarcely that of a guide: he could give them a lively\r\ninterest in the subject, and reveal to them the discoveries and\r\nspeculations of others, but he could not mould and form their belief,\r\nand train them in the work of original investigation. Not being himself\r\ndevoutly attached to any system of philosophical belief, he would be\r\ncautious of offending the philosophical prejudices of others. He loved\r\nlearning, but his temper was undecided and vacillating: whilst,\r\ntherefore, he delighted in accumulating stores of Greek erudition, the\r\ntendency of his mind was, in the midst of a variety of inconsistent\r\ndoctrines, to leave the conclusion undetermined. Although he listened to\r\nvarious instructors—Phædrus the Epicurean, Diodotus the Stoic, and Philo\r\nthe Academician—he found the eclecticism of the latter more congenial to\r\nhis taste. Its preference of probability to certainty suited one who\r\nshrunk from the responsibility of deciding.\r\n\r\nIt is this personality, as it were, which gives a special interest to\r\nthe Ciceronian philosophy. The reflexion of his personal character which\r\npervades it rescues it from the imputation of being a mere transcript of\r\nhis Greek originals. Cicero brings everything as much as possible to a\r\npractical standard. If the question arises between the study of morals\r\nand politics and that of physics or metaphysics, he decides in favour of\r\nthe former, on the grounds that the latter transcends the capacities of\r\nthe human intellect;[848] that in morals and politics we are under\r\nobligations from which in physics we are free; that we are bound to tear\r\nourselves from these abstract studies at the call of duty to our country\r\nor our fellow-creatures, even if we were able to count the stars or\r\nmeasure the magnitude of the universe.[849] In the didactic method which\r\nhe pursues he bears in mind that he is dealing not with contemplative\r\nphilosophers, or minds that have been logically trained, but with\r\nstatesmen and men of the world; he does not therefore claim too much, or\r\nmake his lessons too hard, and is always ready to sacrifice scientific\r\nsystem to a method of popular instruction. His object seems to be to\r\nrecommend the subject—to smoothe difficulties, and illustrate\r\nobscurities. He evidently admires the exalted purity of Stoical\r\nmorality; and the principles of that sect are those which he endeavours\r\nto impress upon his son.[850] His only fear is that their system is\r\nimpracticable.[851]\r\n\r\nCicero believed in the existence of one supreme Creator and Governor of\r\nthe universe, and also in His spiritual nature;[852] but his belief is\r\nrather the result of instinctive conviction, than of the proofs derived\r\nfrom philosophy; for as to them, he is, as on other points, uncertain\r\nand wavering. He disbelieved the popular mythical religion; but,\r\nuncertain as to what was the truth, he would not have that disturbed\r\nwhich he looked upon as a political engine.[853] Amidst the doubtful and\r\nconflicting reasons, respecting the human soul and man’s eternal\r\ndestiny, there is no doubt that, although he finds no satisfactory\r\nproof, he is a believer in immortality.[854] It is unnecessary to pursue\r\nthe subject of his philosophical creed any further, because it is not a\r\nsystem, but only a collection of precepts, not of investigations. Its\r\nmaterials are borrowed, its illustrations alone novel. But,\r\nnevertheless, the study of Cicero’s philosophical works is invaluable,\r\nin order to understand the minds of those who came after him. It must\r\nnot be forgotten, that not only all Roman philosophy after his time, but\r\na great part of that of the middle ages, was Greek philosophy filtered\r\nthrough Latin, and mainly founded on that of Cicero. Cicero’s works on\r\nspeculative philosophy generally consist of—(1.) _The Academics_, or a\r\nhistory and defence of the belief of the New Academy. (2.) The _De\r\nFinibus Bonorum et Malorum_, dialogues on the supreme good, the end of\r\nall moral action. (3.) _The Tusculanæ Disputationes_, containing five\r\nindependent treatises on the fear of death, the endurance of pain, the\r\npower of wisdom over sorrow, the morbid passions, the relation of virtue\r\nto happiness. In these treatises Stoicism predominates, although\r\nopinions are adduced from the whole range of Greek philosophy. (4.)\r\n_Paradoxa_, in which the six celebrated Stoical paradoxies are touched\r\nupon in a light and amusing manner. (5.) A dialogue in praise of\r\nphilosophy, named after Hortensius. (6.) Translations of the Timæus and\r\nProtagoras of Plato. Of these last three treatises only a few fragments\r\nremain.\r\n\r\nHis moral philosophy comprehends—(1.) The _De Officiis_, a Stoical\r\ntreatise on moral obligations, addressed to his son Marcus, at that time\r\na student at Athens. (2.) The unequalled little essays on Friendship and\r\nOld Age. A few words also are preserved of two books on Glory, addressed\r\nto Atticus; and one which he wrote on the Alleviation of Grief when\r\nbereaved of his beloved daughter.[855] He left one theological work in\r\nthree parts: the first part is on the “Nature of the Gods;” the second\r\non the “Science of Divination;” the third on “Fate,” of which an\r\ninconsiderable fragment is extant. His office of augur probably\r\nsuggested to him the composition of these treatises.\r\n\r\nHis political works are two in number—the _De Republica_[856] and _De\r\nLegibus_; both are imperfect. The remains of the former are only\r\nfragmentary; of the latter, three out of six books are extant, and those\r\nnot entire. Nevertheless, sufficient of both remains to enable us to\r\nform some estimate of their philosophical character. Although he does\r\nnot profess originality, but confesses that they are imitations of the\r\ntwo treatises of Plato, which bear the same name, still they are more\r\ninductive than any of his other treatises. His purpose is, like that of\r\nPlato, to give in the one an ideal republic, and in the other a sketch\r\nof a model legislation; but the novelty of the treatment consists in\r\ntheir principles being derived from the Roman constitution and the Roman\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nThe questions which he proposes to answer are, what is the best\r\ngovernment and the best code: but the limits within which he confines\r\nhimself are the institutions of his country. In the Republic he first\r\ndiscusses, like the Greek philosophers, the merits and demerits of the\r\nthree pure forms of government; and upon the whole decides in favour of\r\nmonarchy[857] as the best. With Aristotle[858] he agrees that all the\r\npure forms are liable to degenerate,[859] and comes to the conclusion\r\nthat the idea of a perfect polity is a combination of all three.[860] In\r\norder to prove and illustrate his theory, he investigates, though it\r\nmust be confessed in a meager and imperfect manner, the constitutional\r\nhistory of Rome, and discovers the monarchical element in the\r\nconsulship, the aristocratic in the senate, and the popular in the\r\nassembly of the people and the tribunitial authority.\r\n\r\nThe Romans continued jealously to preserve the shadow of their\r\nconstitution even after they had surrendered the substance. Nominally,\r\nthe titles and offices of the old republic never perished—the Emperor\r\nwas in name nothing more than (Imperator) the commander-in-chief of the\r\narmies of the republic, but in him all power centred: he was absolute,\r\nautocratic, the chief of a military despotism.[861] Cicero, as the\r\ntreatise _De Legibus_ plainly shows, saw, with approbation, that this\r\nstate of things was rapidly coming to pass; that the people were not\r\nfitted to be trusted with liberty, and yet that they would be contented\r\nwith its semblance and name.\r\n\r\nThe method which he pursues, is, firstly, to treat the subject in the\r\nabstract, and to investigate the nature of law; and, secondly, to\r\npropose an ideal code, limited by the principles of Roman jurisprudence.\r\nThus Cicero’s polity and code were not Utopian—the models on which they\r\nwere formed had a real tangible existence. His was the system of a\r\npractical man, as the Roman constitution was that of a practical people.\r\nIt was not like Greek liberty, the realization of one single idea; it\r\nwas like that of England, the growth of ages, the development of a long\r\ntrain of circumstances, and expedients, and experiments, and\r\nemergencies. Cicero prudently acquiesced in the ruin of liberty as a\r\nstern necessity; but he evidently thought that Rome had attained the\r\nzenith of its national greatness immediately before the agitations of\r\nthe Gracchi.\r\n\r\nBoth these works are written in the engaging form of dialogues. In the\r\none, Scipio Æmilianus, Lælius, Scævola, and others, meet together in the\r\nLatin holidays (Feriæ Latinæ,) and discuss the question of government.\r\nIn the other, the writer himself, with his brother Quintus and Atticus,\r\nconverse on jurisprudence whilst they saunter on a little islet near\r\nArpinum at the confluence of the Liris and Fibrena.\r\n\r\nWe must, lastly, contemplate Cicero as a correspondent. This intercourse\r\nof congenial minds separated from one another, and induced by the force\r\nof circumstances to digest and arrange their thoughts in their\r\ncommunication, forms one of the most delightful and interesting, and at\r\nthe same time one of the most characteristic, portions of Roman\r\nliterature. A Roman thought that whenever he put pen to paper it was his\r\nduty, to a certain extent, to avoid carelessness and offences against\r\ngood taste, and to bestow upon his friend some portion of that elaborate\r\nattention which, as an author, he would devote to the public eye. In\r\nfact the letter-writer was almost addressing the same persons as the\r\nauthor; for the latter wrote for the approbation of his friends, the\r\ncircle of intimates in which he lived: the approbation of the public was\r\na secondary object. The Greeks were not writers of letters: the few\r\nwhich we possess were mere written messages, containing such necessary\r\ninformation as the interruption of intercourse demanded. There was no\r\ninterchange of hopes and fears, thoughts, sentiments, and feelings.\r\n\r\nThe extent of Cicero’s correspondence is almost incredible: even those\r\nepistles which remain form a very voluminous collection—more than eight\r\nhundred are extant. The letters to his friends and acquaintances (ad\r\nFamiliares) occupy sixteen books; those to Atticus sixteen more; and we\r\nhave besides three books of letters to Quintus, and one to Brutus; but\r\nthe authenticity of this last collection is somewhat doubtful. It is\r\nquite clear that none of them were intended for publication, as those of\r\nPliny and Seneca were. They are elegant without stiffness, the natural\r\noutpourings of a mind which could not give birth to an ungraceful idea.\r\nWhen speaking of the perilous and critical politics of the day, more or\r\nless restraint and reserve are apparent, according to the intimacy with\r\nthe person whom he is addressing, but no attempt at pompous display. His\r\nstyle is so simple that the reader forgets that Cicero ever wrote or\r\ndelivered an oration. There is the eloquence of the heart, not of the\r\nrhetoric school. Every subject is touched upon which could interest the\r\nstatesman, the man of letters, the admirer of the fine arts, or the man\r\nof the world. The writer reveals in them his own motives, his secret\r\nsprings of actions, his loves, his hatreds, his strength, his weakness.\r\nThey extend over more than a quarter of a century, the most interesting\r\nperiod of his own life, and one of the most critical in the history of\r\nhis country. The letters to Quintus are those of an elder brother to one\r\nwho stood in great need of good advice. Although Quintus was not\r\ndeserving of his brother’s affection, M. Cicero was warmly attached to\r\nhim, and took an interest in his welfare. Quintus was proprætor of Asia,\r\nand not fitted for the office; and Cicero was not sparing in his\r\nadmonitions, though he offered them with kindness and delicacy. The\r\ndetails of his family concerns form not the least interesting portion of\r\nthis correspondence. There is, as might be expected, more reserve in the\r\nletters _ad Familiares_ than in those addressed to Atticus. They are\r\nwritten to a variety of correspondents, of every shade and complexion of\r\nopinions, many of them mere acquaintances, not intimate friends; but\r\nwhilst, for this reason, less historically valuable, they are the most\r\npleasing of the collection, on account of the exquisite elegance of\r\ntheir style. They are models of pure Latinity. In the letters to\r\nAtticus, on the other hand, he lays bare the secrets of his heart; he\r\ntrusts his life in his hands; he is not only his friend but his\r\nconfidant, his second self. Were it not for the letters of Cicero, we\r\nshould have had but a superficial knowledge of this period of Roman\r\nhistory, as well as of the inner life of Roman society.\r\n\r\nAn elegant poetic compliment paid to Cicero by Laurea Tullus, one of his\r\nfreedmen, has been preserved by Pliny.[862] The subject of it is a\r\nmedicinal spring in the neighbourhood of the Academy.\r\n\r\n          Quo tua Romanæ vindex clarissime linguæ\r\n            Silva loco melius surgere jussa viret\r\n          Atque Academiæ celebratam nomine villam\r\n            Nunc reparat cultu sub potiore Vetus:\r\n          Hic etiam adparent lymphæ non ante repertæ\r\n            Languida quæ infuso lumina rore levant.\r\n          Nimirum locus ipse sui Ciceronis honori\r\n            Hoc dedit hac fontes cum patefecit opes\r\n          Ut quoniam totum legitur sine fine per orbem\r\n            Sint plures oculis quæ medeantur, aquæ.\r\n\r\n          Father of eloquence in Rome,\r\n            The groves that once pertained to thee\r\n          Now with a fresher verdure bloom\r\n            Around thy famed Academy.\r\n\r\n          Vetus at length this favoured seat\r\n            Hath with a tasteful care restored;\r\n          And newly at thy loved retreat\r\n            A gushing fount its stream has poured.\r\n\r\n          These waters cure an aching sight;\r\n            And thus the spring that bursts to view\r\n          Through future ages shall requite\r\n            The fame this spot from Tully drew.      _Elton._\r\n\r\nThe correspondents of Cicero included a number of eminent men. Atticus\r\nwas the least interesting, for his politic caution rendered him unstable\r\nand insincere; but there was Cassius the tyrannicide; the Stoical Cato\r\nof Utica; Cæcina, the warm partisan of Pompey; the orator Cælius Rufus;\r\nHirtius and Oppius, the literary friends of Cæsar; Lucceius the\r\nhistorian; Matius the mimiambic poet; and that patron of arts and\r\nletters,[863] C. Asinius Pollio.\r\n\r\nPollio was a scion of a distinguished house, and was born at Rome B. C.\r\n76.[864] Even as a youth he was distinguished for wit and\r\nsprightliness;[865] and at the age of twenty-two was the prosecutor of\r\nC. Cato. He was with Cæsar at the Rubicon, at Pharsalia, in Africa, and\r\nin Spain; and was finally intrusted with the conduct of the war in that\r\nprovince against Sextus Pompey. On the establishment of the first\r\ntriumvirate, Pollio, after some hesitation, sent in his adhesion; and\r\nAntony intrusted him with the administration of Gallia Transpadana,\r\nincluding the allotment of the confiscated lands among the veteran\r\nsoldiers. He thus had opportunity of protecting Virgil and saving his\r\nproperty. In B. C. 40, Octavian and Antony were reconciled at Brundisium\r\nby his mediation. A successful campaign in Illyria concluded his\r\nmilitary career with the glories of a triumph,[866] and he then retired\r\nfrom public life to his villa at Tusculum, and devoted himself to study.\r\nHe enjoyed life to the last, and died in his eightieth year. He left\r\nthree children, one of whom, Asinius Gallus,[867] wrote a comparison\r\nbetween his father and Cicero, which was answered by the Emperor\r\nClaudius.[868]\r\n\r\nIn oratory, poetry, and history, Pollio enjoyed a high reputation among\r\ncontemporary critics, and yet none of his works have survived. The\r\nsolution of this difficulty may, perhaps, be found in the following\r\ncircumstances:—1. His patronage of literary men rendered him popular,\r\nand drew from the critics a somewhat partial verdict. His kindness\r\ncaused Horace to extol[869] him, and Virgil to address to him his most\r\nremarkable eclogue.[870] 2. His taste was formed before the new literary\r\nschool commenced. He had always a profound admiration for the old\r\nwriters, and frequently quoted them. His style probably appeared\r\nantiquated and pedantic, and, therefore, never became generally popular.\r\nA later writer[871] says, that he was so harsh and dry as to appear to\r\nhave reproduced the style of Attius and Pacuvius, not only in his\r\ntragedies, but also in his orations. Quintilian observes,[872] that he\r\nseemed to belong to the pre-Ciceronian period. Niebuhr, who could only\r\nform his opinion upon the slight fragments preserved by Seneca, for the\r\nthree letters in Cicero’s collection[873] are only despatches, affirms\r\nthat he seems to stand between two distinct generations,[874] namely,\r\nthe literary periods of Cicero and Virgil. His great work was a history\r\nof the civil wars, in seventeen books. He pretended to be a critic, but\r\nhis criticism was fastidious and somewhat ill-natured. He found\r\nblemishes in Cicero, inaccuracies in Cæsar, pedantry in Sallust, and\r\nprovincialism (Patavinitas) in Livy. The correctness of his judgment\r\nrespecting the charming narratives of the great historian has been\r\nassumed from generation to generation, yet no one can discover in what\r\nthis _Pativinity_ consists. It was easier to find fault than to write\r\ncorrectly; for, whilst all the labours of the critic have perished,\r\nCicero, Cæsar, Sallust, and Livy are immortal. Vehemence and passion\r\ndeveloped his character.\r\n\r\nStill he was one of the greatest benefactors to the literature of his\r\ncountry; more especially as he was the first to found a public library.\r\nBooks had already been brought to Rome, and collections formed. Æmilius\r\nPaulus had a library—Lucullus had one also, to which he allowed learned\r\nmen to have access. Sulla enriched Rome with the plunder of the Athenian\r\nlibraries; and in his time Tyrannis the grammarian was the possessor of\r\nthree thousand volumes. Julius Cæsar employed the learned Varro to\r\ncollect books with a view to a national collection, but death put a stop\r\nto his intentions.[875] Pollio expended the spoils of Dalmatia in\r\nfounding a temple to Liberty in the Aventine, and furnishing it with a\r\nlibrary, the nucleus of which were the collections of Sulla and Varro.\r\nAfter this time, the work was carried on by imperial munificence.\r\nAugustus founded the Octavian library in the temple of Juno, and the\r\nPalatine in the palace. Tiberius augmented the latter. Vespasian placed\r\none in the temple of Peace. Trajan formed the Ulpian; Domitian the\r\nCapitoline; Hadrian a magnificent one at his own villa; and in the reign\r\nof Constantine the number of public libraries exceeded twenty.\r\n\r\n\r\n             M. TERENTIUS VARRO REATINUS (BORN B. C. 116.)\r\n\r\nOn an ancient medal is represented the effigy of Julius Cæsar bearing a\r\nbook in one hand and a sword in the other,[876] with the legend “Ex\r\nutroque Cæsar.” This device represents the genius of many a\r\ndistinguished citizen of the republic, and that of Varro amongst the\r\nnumber, for he was a soldier, and at the same time the most learned of\r\nhis countrymen. He was born[877] at Reate (Rieti,) a Sabine town\r\nsituated in the Tempe of Italy, in the neighbourhood of the celebrated\r\ncascade of Terni. Ælius Stilo, the antiquarian, was the instructor of\r\nhis earlier years,[878] and from him he derived his thirst for\r\nknowledge, and his ardent devotion to original investigation. He\r\nsubsequently studied philosophy under Antiochus, a professor of the\r\nAcademic school.[879] In politics he was warmly attached to the party of\r\nPompey, under whom he served in the Piratic and Mithridatic wars. He was\r\nalso one of his three _Legati_ in Spain, and did not resign his command\r\nuntil the towns in the south of that province eagerly submitted to\r\nCæsar. After the battle of Pharsalia, he experienced the clemency of the\r\nconqueror, but not soon enough to save his villa from being attacked and\r\nplundered.[880]\r\n\r\nCæsar appreciated Varro’s extensive learning and intrusted to him the\r\nformation of the great public library.[881] Henceforth he shunned the\r\nperils of political life,[882] and in the retirement of his villas\r\ndevoted himself zealously to the pursuit of literature. Nevertheless he\r\ncould not escape the unrelenting persecution of political party; for in\r\nthat proscription to which Cicero fell a victim, his name was in the\r\nlist until it was erased by Antony.[883] Although he was seventy years\r\nold, his industry was unabated, and he continued his literary labours\r\nuntil his death, which took place in the eighty-ninth year of his\r\nage.[884] Varro was a man of ponderous erudition and unwearied\r\nindustry,[885] without a spark of taste and genius. No Roman author\r\nwrote so much as he did, no one read so much except Pliny; yet,\r\nnotwithstanding all this practice and study, he never acquired an\r\nagreeable style. He dissected and anatomized the Latin language with all\r\nthe powers of critical analysis; but he was never imbued with its\r\nelegant polish or its nervous eloquence.\r\n\r\nWherever, as in the case of his treatise on agriculture, he had access\r\nto sound information and good authority, his habits of arrangement, the\r\nclearness with which he classified, and the careful judgment with which\r\nhe adduced his facts, render his works valuable. Few men have possessed\r\ngreater powers of combining and systematizing: his mind was, as it were,\r\nfull of compartments, in which each species of knowledge had its proper\r\nplace, but it was nothing more. Whenever he left the beaten track of\r\nother men’s discoveries, and indulged in free conjecture or original\r\nthought, as in his grammatical works, his learning seems to desert him;\r\nand etymology, which has tempted so many mere conjecturers to go astray,\r\nled him also into absurdity.\r\n\r\nOne of his works, _Antiquitates Divinarum Rerum_, acquires a peculiar\r\ninterest from the fact of its having been the storehouse from which St.\r\nAugustine, who was a great admirer of his learning, derived much of his\r\ntreatise _De Civitate Dei_. How this laborious compilation was lost it\r\nis impossible to say. We can only lament the accident which deprives us\r\nof the work to which especially the author owes his reputation. In the\r\ntreatise, which together with this forms one work, namely, _Antiquitates\r\nRerum Humanarum_, he investigated the early history and chronology of\r\nRome,[886] and fixed the date of the building of the city in the year\r\nB. C. 753, a date which is now commonly received by the best\r\nhistorians.[887]\r\n\r\nA catalogue of his numerous books and tracts on almost every subject\r\nwhich then engaged the attention of literary men—on history, biography,\r\ngeography, philosophy, criticism, and morals—would be uninteresting, but\r\nhis principal works were as follows:—\r\n\r\n     I. _De Re Rustica, Libri_ III.\r\n\r\n    II. _De Lingua Latina, Libri_ XXIV., of which only six are extant,\r\n   and these in a mutilated condition.\r\n\r\n   III.  _Antiquitates Rerum Humanarum, Libri_ XXV. _Antiquitates Rerum\r\n   Divinarum, Libri_ XVI.\r\n\r\n    IV. _Saturæ_, partly in prose, partly in verse; consisting of moral\r\n   essays and dialogues, exposing the vices and follies of the day, and\r\n   teaching their lessons rather in a light and amusing than a didactic\r\n   form.\r\n\r\n     V. Poems, of which eighteen short epigrams of no great merit are\r\n   extant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                 ROMAN HISTORICAL LITERATURE—PRINCIPAL\r\nHISTORIANS—LUCCEIUS—LUCULLUS—CORNELIUS NEPOS—OPINIONS OF THE GENUINENESS\r\n       OF THE WORKS WHICH BEAR HIS NAME—BIOGRAPHY OF J. CÆSAR—HIS\r\n   COMMENTARIES—THEIR STYLE AND LANGUAGE—HIS MODESTY OVERRATED—OTHER\r\n                       WORKS—CHARACTER OF CÆSAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          HISTORICAL WRITERS.\r\n\r\nIn historical composition alone can the Romans lay claim to originality;\r\nand in their historical literature especially is exhibited a faithful\r\ntranscript of their mind and character. History at once gratified their\r\npatriotism, and its investigations were in accordance with their love of\r\nthe real and practical. Thus those natural powers which had been\r\nelicited and cultivated by an acquaintance with Greek literature were\r\napplied with a naïve simplicity to the narration of events, and\r\nembellished them with all the graces of a refined style. The practical\r\ngood sense and political wisdom which the Roman social system was\r\nadmirably adapted to nurture found food for reflection: their shrewd\r\ninsight into character, and their searching scrutiny into the human\r\nheart gave them a power over their materials; and hence they were\r\nenabled in this department of literature to emulate, not merely imitate,\r\nthe Greeks, and to be their rivals, and sometimes their superiors. The\r\nelegant simplicity of Cæsar is as attractive as that of Herodotus; not\r\none of the Greek historians surpasses Livy in talent for the\r\npicturesque, and in the charm with which he invests his spirited and\r\nliving stories; whilst for condensation of thought, terseness of\r\nexpression, and political and philosophical acumen, Tacitus is not\r\ninferior to Thucydides.\r\n\r\nThe subjects which historical investigation furnished were so peculiarly\r\nnational, so congenial to the character of the mind of the Romans, that\r\nthey seem to have cast aside their Greek originals, and to have struck\r\nout an independent line for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of Roman historians is a proud one. At the head of it\r\nstand the four great names of Cæsar, Sallust, Livy, and Tacitus; all of\r\nwhom, except the last, belong to the Augustan age. It comprehends those\r\nof Cornelius Nepos, Trogus Pompeius, Cremutius Cordus, Aufidius Bassus,\r\nand Sallust, in the golden age; Velleius Paterculus, Valerius Maximus,\r\nQ. Curtius, Suetonius, and Florus, in the succeeding one; nor must L.\r\nLucceius and L. Licinius Lucullus be passed over without mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              L. LUCCEIUS.\r\n\r\nL. Lucceius, the friend and correspondent of Cicero,[888] was an orator\r\nwho espoused the party of J. Cæsar, and relying on his influence,\r\nbecame, together with him, a candidate for the consulship.[889] Being\r\nunsuccessful, he quitted politics for the calm enjoyment of a literary\r\nlife. His right to be called an historian is founded on his having\r\ncommenced a history of the Social and Civil Wars, but it was never\r\ncompleted or published. Cicero[890] entreats him to speak of the events\r\nwhich he was recording, as well as of his own character and conduct,\r\nwith partiality; it is, therefore, impossible to trust the encomiums\r\nwhich accompany this request, as they were probably dictated by a wish\r\nto purchase his favourable opinion. The period of his retirement from\r\npublic affairs was not of long duration, for he afterwards again engaged\r\nin the civil strife which agitated Rome, and joined the party of Pompey,\r\nwho held him in high estimation.[891] On his downfall he shared with\r\nother Pompeians the clemency of the dictator.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         L. LICINIUS LUCULLUS.\r\n\r\nL. Licinius Lucullus,[892] the illustrious but luxurious conqueror of\r\nMithridates, did not disdain to devote his leisure to the composition of\r\nhistory, although his works are not of such merit as to claim for him a\r\ndistinguished position among the historians of his country. The stirring\r\nevents of the Social War tempted him to record them.[893] Part of his\r\nenormous wealth he had expended on a magnificent library: to the poet\r\nArchias he was a kind friend;[894] and his patronage was liberally\r\ngranted to literary men, especially to those philosophers who held the\r\ndoctrines of his favourite Academy. Like most of those who combined with\r\na love of literature a life of activity in the public service of his\r\ncountry, he was an orator of no mean abilities.[895] His love of Greek,\r\nand his habits of intercourse with Greek philosophers, led him to write\r\nhis history in the Greek language, and to select and transcribe extracts\r\nfrom the histories of Cælius Antipater and Polybius.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CORNELIUS NEPOS.\r\n\r\nCornelius Nepos was a contemporary of Catullus, and lived until the\r\nsixth year of the reign of Augustus.[896] Ausonius says that he was a\r\nGaul,[897] Catullus that he was an Italian.[898] Both are probably\r\nright, as the prevailing opinion is, that he was born either at Verona,\r\nor the neighbouring village of Hostilia in Cisalpine Gaul. Besides\r\nCatullus, he reckoned Cicero[899] and Atticus amongst the number of his\r\nfriends.[900] These circumstances constitute all that is known\r\nrespecting his personal history.\r\n\r\nAll his works which are mentioned by the ancients are unfortunately\r\nlost; but respecting the genuineness of that with which every scholar is\r\nfamiliar from his childhood, strong doubts have been entertained. His\r\nlost works were, (1.) Three books of Chronicles, or a short abridgment\r\nof Universal History. They are mentioned by A. Gellius,[901] and\r\nallusion is made to them by Catullus.[902] (2.) Five books of anecdotes\r\nstyled “Libri Exemplorum,”[903] and also entitled “The Book of C. Nepos\r\n_de Viris illustribus_.” (3.) A Life of Cicero,[904] and a collection of\r\nLetters addressed to him.[905] (4.) “De Historicis,” or Memoirs of\r\nHistorians.[906] The work now extant which bears his name is entitled\r\n“The Lives of Eminent Generals.” But besides the biographies of twenty\r\ngenerals, it contains short accounts of some celebrated monarchs, lives\r\nof Hamilcar and Hannibal, and also of Cato and Atticus. The Proëmium of\r\nthe book is addressed to one Atticus, and to the first edition was\r\nprefixed a dedication to the Emperor Theodosius, from which it appeared\r\nthat the author’s name was Probus. These biographical sketches continued\r\nto be ascribed to this unknown author until the latter half of the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nAt that time the celebrated scholar Lambinus, Regius Professor of Belles\r\nLettres at Paris, argued from the purity of the style that it was a work\r\nof classical antiquity, and, from a passage in the life of Cato, that\r\nthe Atticus, to whom it was dedicated, was the well-known correspondent\r\nof Cicero, and the author no other than Cornelius Nepos. The argument\r\nderived from the Latinity is unanswerable; that, however, from the life\r\nof Cato is a “_petitio principii_,” inasmuch as there is no more\r\nevidence in favour of the life of Cato having been written by Nepos,\r\nthan the other biographies. The life of Atticus, which is a complete\r\nmodel of biographical composition, is ascribed to him by name in some of\r\nthe best MSS. Of the rest nothing more can be affirmed with certainty,\r\nthan that they are a work, or the epitome of a work, belonging to the\r\nAugustan age.\r\n\r\nThe strongest evidence which exists in favour of the authorship of C.\r\nNepos, is that Jerome Magius, a contemporary of Lambinus, who also\r\npublished an annotated edition of the “_Vitæ Illustrium Imperatorum_,”\r\nfound a MS. with the following conclusion: “Completum est opus Æmilii\r\nProbi Cornelii Nepotis.” These words would seem to assert the authorship\r\nof Nepos, and at the same time to admit that Probus was the editor or\r\nepitomator, and thus support the theory of Lambinus, without accusing\r\nProbus of a literary forgery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   C. JULIUS CÆSAR (BORN B. C. 100.)\r\n\r\nTo give a biographical account of Cæsar would be, in fact, nothing less\r\nthan to trace the contemporary history of Rome; for Roman history had\r\nnow become the history of those master-minds who seized upon, or were\r\ninvested by their countrymen with, supreme power. Although the rapid and\r\nenergetic talents of Cæsar never permitted him to lose a day, his active\r\ndevotion to the truly Roman employments of politics and war, left him\r\nlittle time for sedentary occupations. His literary biography,\r\ntherefore, will necessarily occupy but a short space, compared with the\r\nother great events of his career.\r\n\r\nC. Julius Cæsar was descended from a family of the Julian _gens_, one of\r\nthe oldest among the patrician families of Rome, of which all but a very\r\nfew had by this time become extinct. The Cæsar family was not only of\r\npatrician descent, but numbered amongst its members, during the century\r\nwhich preceded the birth of the Dictator, many who had served curule\r\noffices with great distinction. He was born on the 4th of the ides of\r\nJuly (the 12th,) B. C. 100, and attached himself, both by politics and\r\nby matrimonial connexion to the popular party: his good taste, great\r\ntact, and pleasing manners, contributed, together with his talents, to\r\ninsure his popularity. He became a soldier in the nineteenth year of his\r\nage; and hence his works display all the best qualities which are\r\nfostered by a military education, and which therefore characterize the\r\nmilitary profession—frankness, simplicity, and brevity. He served his\r\nfirst campaign at the conclusion of the first Mithridatic war, during\r\nwhich he was present at the siege and capture of Mitylene,[907] and\r\nreceived the honour of a civic crown for saving the life of a citizen.\r\n\r\nHis earliest literary triumph was as an orator. Cn. Dolabella was\r\nsuspected of oppressive extortion in the administration of his province\r\nof Macedonia, and Cæsar came forward as his accuser. The celebrated\r\nHortensius was the advocate for the accused; and although Cæsar did not\r\ngain his cause, the skill and eloquence which he displayed as a pleader\r\ngave promise of his becoming hereafter a consummate orator. The\r\nfollowing year he increased his reputation by taking up the cause of the\r\nprovince of Achaia against C. Antonius, who was accused of the same\r\ncrime as Dolabella; but he was again unsuccessful in the result.\r\n\r\nHe subsequently sailed for Rhodes, in order to pursue the study of\r\noratory under the direction of Apollonius Molon,[908] who was not only a\r\nteacher of rhetoric, but also an able and eloquent pleader in the courts\r\nof law. Cicero[909] bears testimony to his being a skilful instructor\r\nand an eloquent speaker, and received instruction from him when he came\r\nto Rome as an ambassador from Rhodes.[910] Cæsar, on his voyage, was\r\ncaptured by pirates; but after he was ransomed, he carried his intention\r\ninto effect, and placed himself for a short time under the tuition of\r\nMolon. After his return to Rome,[911] a proposition was made to recall\r\nfrom exile those of the party of Lepidus, who had joined Sertorius, and\r\nhe spoke in favour of the measure. Two years subsequently he delivered\r\nfuneral orations in praise of his wife Cornelia, who was the daughter of\r\nCinna, and his aunt Julia, the widow of Marius.\r\n\r\nThe Catilinarian conspiracy, in which, without reason, he was suspected\r\nof having been concerned, furnished him with another opportunity of\r\ndisplaying his ability as an orator. His speech in the senate on the\r\ncelebrated nones of December, would probably have saved the lives of the\r\nconspirators, had not Cato’s influence prevailed. Cæsar pleaded that it\r\nwas unconstitutional to put Roman citizens to death by the vote of the\r\nsenate, without a trial; but his arguments were overruled, and the\r\nmeasure which subsequently led to the fall and assassination of Cicero\r\nwas carried. The following year,[912] when Metellus made this a subject\r\nof accusation against Cicero, Cæsar again supported the same view with\r\nhis eloquence, but was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nGreat, therefore, although it is said that his talents as an orator\r\nwere, he never appears to have convinced his hearers. This may have been\r\nowing, not to deficiency in skill, but to the unfortunate nature of the\r\ncauses which he took in hand, or to the superior powers of his\r\nopponents, for there is no doubt that his manner of speaking was most\r\nengaging and popular. Tacitus speaks of him not only as the greatest of\r\nauthors,[913] but also as rivalling the most accomplished orators;[914]\r\nwhilst Suetonius praises his eloquence, and quotes the testimony of\r\nCicero himself in support of his favourable criticism.[915]\r\n\r\nHitherto, with the exception of his first campaign, the life of Cæsar\r\nwas of a civil complexion. His literary eminence took the colouring of\r\nthe public occupations in which he was engaged. Like a true Roman,\r\nliterature was subordinate to public duty, and his taste was directed\r\ninto the channel which was most akin to, and identified with, his life.\r\nHis intellectual vigour, however, demanded employment as well as his\r\npractical talents for business; and for this reason, as has been seen,\r\nhe devoted himself to the study of oratory; and the principal works\r\nwhich as yet obtain for him a place in a history of Roman literature are\r\nmerely orations.\r\n\r\nHis next official appointment opened to him a new field for thought. In\r\nB. C. 63 he obtained the office of Pontifex Maximus, and examined so\r\ndiligently into the history and nature of the Roman belief in augury, of\r\nwhich he was the official guardian, that his investigations were\r\npublished in a work consisting of at least sixteen books (_Libri\r\nAuspiciorum_.[916]) In order to fit himself for discharging the duties\r\nof his office he studied astronomy, and even wrote a treatise on that\r\nscience,[917] entitled “_de Astris_”, and a poem somewhat resembling the\r\nPhenomena of Aratus. His knowledge of this science enabled him, with the\r\naid of the Alexandrian astronomers, to carry into effect some years[918]\r\nafterwards the reformation of the calendar.\r\n\r\nThe works above mentioned are philosophically and scientifically\r\nvalueless, but curious and interesting; but we have now to view Cæsar in\r\nthat capacity which was the foundation of his literary reputation. He\r\nobtained the province of Hispania Ulterior;[919] and at this post his\r\ncareer as a military commander began. As had been the case during his\r\nprevious career, so now the almost incessant demands on his thoughts and\r\ntime did not divert him from literary pursuits, but determined the\r\nchannel in which his tastes should seek satisfaction, and furnished the\r\nsubject for his pen. He had evidently an ardent love for literature for\r\nits own sake. It was not the paltry ambition of showing that he could\r\nachieve success, and, even superiority, in every thing which he chose to\r\nundertake, although his versatility of talent was such as to encourage\r\nhim to expect success, but a real attachment to literary employment.\r\nHence whatever leisure his duties as a military commander permitted him\r\nto enjoy was devoted, as to a labour of love, to the composition of his\r\nMemoirs or Commentaries of the Gallic and Civil Wars.\r\n\r\nHis comprehensive and liberal mind was also convinced of the\r\nembarrassing technicalities which impeded the administration of the\r\nRoman law. Its interpretation was confined to a few who had studied its\r\npedantic mysteries; and the laws which regulated the _dies fasti_ and\r\n_nefasti_ had originally placed its administration in the hands of the\r\npriests and patricians. Appius Claudius had already commenced the work\r\nof demolishing the fences which to the people at large were impregnable;\r\nand Cæsar entertained the grand design of reducing its principles and\r\npractice to a regular code.[920] His views he imbodied in a\r\ntreatise,[921] which, as is often the case with pamphlets, perished when\r\nthe object ceased to exist for which it was intended.\r\n\r\nIt is said that he also contemplated a complete survey and map of the\r\nRoman empire.[922] But his greatest benefaction, perhaps, to the cause\r\nof Roman literature was the establishment of a public library.[923] The\r\nspoils of Italy, collected by Asinius Pollio, furnished the materials,\r\njust as the museums of Paris were enriched by the great modern conqueror\r\nfrom the plunder of Europe; but it was, nevertheless, a great and\r\npatriotic work; and he enhanced its utility by intrusting the collection\r\nand arrangement of it to the learned Varro as librarian.\r\n\r\nBesides the works already named, Cæsar left behind him various letters,\r\nsome of which are extant amongst those of Cicero; orations, of which, if\r\nthe panegyrics of Cicero, Tacitus, and Quintilian[924] are not\r\nexaggerated, it is deeply to be regretted that the titles are alone\r\npreserved;[925] a short treatise or pamphlet, called _Anticato_; a work\r\non the analogy of the Latin language; a collection of apothegms; and a\r\nfew poems.\r\n\r\nThese are the grounds on which the claims of the great conqueror to\r\nliterary fame rest in the various capacities of orator, historian,\r\nantiquarian, philosopher, grammarian, and poet; but by far the most\r\nimportant of his works is his “Commentaries.” These have fortunately\r\ncome down to us in a tolerably perfect state, although much still\r\nremains to be done before we can be said to possess an accurate\r\nedition.[926] Seven books contain the history of seven years of the\r\nGallic war, and three carry the history of the civil war down to the\r\ncommencement of the Alexandrine. These are the works of Cæsar himself.\r\nThe eighth book, “_De Bello Gallico_,” which completes the subject, and\r\nthe three supplemental books of the work, “_De Bello Civili_,” which\r\ncontain the Alexandrine, African, and Spanish wars, have been variously\r\nascribed to the friends of Cæsar, A. Hirtius, C. Oppius, and even to\r\nPansa. The claims of the latter, however, are entirely groundless. The\r\nmarked similarity between the style of the eighth book of the Gallic war\r\nand that of the Alexandrine war proves that they were written by the\r\nsame author; and from the elegance and purity of the Latinity, and the\r\nconfidential footing on which the author must have been with Cæsar,\r\nthere is a probability, almost amounting to a certainty, that the\r\nHistory of the Alexandrine War must be the work of A. Hirtius. It may\r\nalso be remarked that this opinion is in unison with that of\r\nSuetonius.[927]\r\n\r\nHirtius was the only one of the three who united in himself both these\r\nimportant qualifications. C. Oppius was indeed equally in the confidence\r\nof Cæsar; he was his inseparable companion.[928] But, nevertheless,\r\nOppius was not so highly educated as Hirtius. Niebuhr, therefore, is\r\nprobably correct in attributing to him, “without hesitation,”[929] the\r\nbook on the African war. The intelligence and information displayed in\r\nit are worthy of the sensible soldier and confidential friend, with whom\r\nhe corresponded in cipher, and whom he intrusted with writing the\r\nintroduction to his defence in the “Anticato;” whilst the inferiority of\r\nthe language marks a less skilful and practised hand than that of the\r\nrefined Hirtius. The book on the Spanish war is by some unknown author:\r\nit is founded on a diary kept by some one engaged in the war; but\r\nneither its language nor sentiments are those of a liberally educated\r\nperson.[930] The Greek term “Ephemerides” has sometimes been applied to\r\nthe “Commentaries,” though Bayle[931] thought that they were different\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nThese memoirs are exactly what they profess to be, and are written in\r\nthe most appropriate style. Few would wish it to be other than it is.\r\nThey are sketches taken on the spot, in the midst of action, whilst the\r\nmind was full: they have all the graphic power of a master-mind, and the\r\nvigorous touches of a master-hand. Take, for example, the delineation of\r\nthe Gallic character, and compare it with some of the features still to\r\nbe found in the mixed race, their successors, and no one can doubt of\r\nits accuracy, or of the deep and penetrating insight into human nature\r\nwhich generally indicates the powerful and practical intellect. Their\r\nelegance and polish is that which always mark even the least-laboured\r\nefforts of a refined and educated taste, not that which proceeds from\r\ncareful emendation and correction. The “Commentaries” are the materials\r\nfor history; notes jotted down for future historians. It is evident that\r\nno more time was spent upon them than would naturally be devoted to such\r\na work by one who was employing the inaction of winter quarters in\r\ndigesting the recollections stored up during the business of the\r\ncampaign; and for this reason few faults have been found with the\r\n“Commentaries,” even by the most fastidious critics. The very faults\r\nwhich may be justly found with the style of Cæsar are such as reflect\r\nthe man himself. The majesty of his character principally consists in\r\nthe imperturbable calmness and equability of his temper. He had no\r\nsudden bursts of energy, and alternations of passion and inactivity: the\r\nelevation of his character was a high one, but it was a level\r\ntable-land. This calmness and equability pervades his writings, and for\r\nthis reason they have been thought to want life and energy; whereas in\r\nreality they are only deficient in contrast, and light and shade. The\r\nuniformity of his active character is interesting as one great element\r\nof his success; but the uniformity of style may perhaps be thought by\r\nsome readers to diminish the interest with which his work is read.\r\n\r\nThe simple beauty of his language is, as Cicero says, statuesque rather\r\nthan picturesque. Simple, severe, naked—“omni ornatu orationis tanquam\r\nveste detracto;” and whilst, like a statue, it conveys the idea of\r\nperfect and well-proportioned beauty, it banishes all thoughts of human\r\npassion. It was this perfect calm propriety, perhaps this absence of all\r\nornamental display, which prevented him from being a successful orator,\r\nand his orations from surviving, although he had every external\r\nqualification for a speaker[932]—a fine voice, graceful action, a noble\r\nand majestic appearance, and a frank and brilliant delivery.\r\n\r\nThe very few instances of doubtful Latinity which a hypercritical spirit\r\nmay detect are scarcely blemishes, and fewer than might have been\r\nexpected from the observation of Hirtius,[933] “Ceteri quam bene atque\r\nemendate, nos etiam, quam facile ac celeriter eos perscripserit,\r\nscimus.” When A. Pollio[934] called his “Commentaries” hasty, his\r\ncriticism was fair; but he was scarcely just in blaming the writer for\r\ninaccuracy and credulity. These faults, so far as they existed, were due\r\nto circumstances, not to himself. His observing mind wished to collect\r\ninformation with respect to the foreign lands which were the field of\r\nhis exploits, and the habits of the inhabitants, quite as much as to\r\ndescribe his own tactics and victories. He naturally accepted the\r\naccounts given him, even when he had no means of testing their veracity.\r\nHe is, therefore, not to blame for recording those which subsequent\r\ndiscoveries have shown to be untrue.\r\n\r\nHis digressions of this character yield in interest to no portion of his\r\nwork; and though some of his accounts of the Gauls and Germans are\r\nincorrect, many were subsequently confirmed by the investigations of\r\nTacitus. The only quality in the character of Cæsar which has been\r\nsometimes exaggerated is modesty. He does not, indeed, add to his own\r\nreputation by detracting from the merits of those who served under him.\r\nHe is honest, generous, and candid, not only towards them, but also\r\ntowards his brave barbarian enemies. Nor is he guilty of egotism in the\r\nstrict literal sense of the term. This, however, is scarcely enough to\r\nwarrant the eulogy which some have founded upon it. He has too good\r\ntaste to recount his successes with pretension and arrogance; but he has\r\nevidently no objection to be the hero of his own tale. He skilfully\r\nveils his selfish, unpatriotic, and ambitious motives; and his object\r\nevidently is to leave such memoirs, that future historians may be able\r\nto hand down the most favourable character of Cæsar to posterity.\r\n\r\nThough himself is his subject, his memoirs are not confessions. Not a\r\nrecord of a weakness appears, nor even of a defect, except that which\r\nthe Romans would readily forgive, cruelty. His savage waste of human\r\nlife he recounts with perfect self-complacency. Vanity was his crowning\r\nerror in his career as a statesman; and though hidden by the reserve\r\nwith which he speaks of himself, it sometimes discovers itself in the\r\nhistorian.\r\n\r\nThe “Commentaries” of Cæsar have sometimes been compared with the work\r\nof the great soldier historian of Greece, Xenophon. Both are eminently\r\nsimple and unaffected; but there the parallel ends. The severe contempt\r\nof ornament which characterizes the stern Roman is totally unlike the\r\nmellifluous sweetness of the Attic writer.\r\n\r\nThe “Anticatones”[935] were two books in answer to Cicero’s panegyric of\r\nCato, which he had written immediately after the philosopher’s death.\r\nHirtius first, at the request of Cæsar, wrote a reply, and sent it to\r\nCicero from Narbonne. Although he denied the justice of Cicero’s\r\neulogium, he secured the good-will of the orator himself by liberal\r\ncommendations.[936] This prepared the way for Cæsar’s own pamphlet.\r\n\r\nHis philological work, _de Analogia_, or _de Ratione Latine Loquendi_,\r\nis commended by Cicero[937] for its extreme accuracy, and was held in\r\nhigh estimation by the Roman grammarians. Probably, in liveliness and\r\noriginality, it was far superior to any of their works. Wonderful to\r\nsay, it was written during the difficulties and occupations of a journey\r\nacross the Alps. From the quotations from it, in the writings of the\r\ngrammarians, we learn that he proposed that the letter V should be\r\nwritten Ⅎ, to mark its connexion with the Greek digamma; and that the\r\nnew orthography, which substituted _lacrimæ_ for _lucrumæ_, _maximus_\r\nfor _maxumus_, &c., was established by his authority.\r\n\r\nThe “_Apophthegmata_” is said to have been a collection of wise and\r\nwitty sayings by himself and others, although it is remarkable not a\r\nsingle witty saying of Cæsar is on record.[938] He began it early in\r\nlife, and was continually making additions to it.\r\n\r\nHis poetical attempts consisted of a tragedy entitled “Œdipus;” a short\r\npiece, the subject of which was the praises of Hercules (both of these,\r\nas well as the Apophthegmata, were suppressed by Augustus;[939]) “Iter,”\r\nan account of his march into Spain; the astronomical poem already\r\nmentioned; and some epigrams, of which three are extant, although their\r\nauthenticity is somewhat doubtful.[940]\r\n\r\nThe character of Cæsar is full of inconsistencies; but they are the\r\ninconsistencies which are natural to man, and are sometimes found in men\r\nof a strong will and commanding talents who are destitute of moral\r\nprinciple. His faults and excellences, his capability and talents, were\r\nthe result of his natural powers—not of pains or study. He was one of\r\nthe greatest as well as one of the worst men who ever lived. He was an\r\nEpicurean in faith, and yet he had all the superstition which so often\r\naccompanies infidelity. His habitual humanity and clemency towards his\r\nfellow-citizens were interrupted by instances of stern and pitiless\r\ncruelty. He shed tears at the assassination of Pompey, and yet could\r\nmassacre the Usipetes and the Tenchteri, and acted like a savage\r\nbarbarian towards his chivalrous foe Vercingetorix. He delighted in the\r\npure and refined pleasures of literature, and his intimate associates\r\nwere men of taste and genius; and yet he was the slave of his sensual\r\npassions, and indulged in the grossest profligacy. He was candid,\r\nfriendly, confiding, generous; but he was attracted by brilliant\r\ntalents, and the qualities of the head, rather than the affections of\r\nthe heart. The mainspring of his conduct as a general and a statesman\r\nexhibits a strong will and perfect self-reliance; and in like manner he\r\nowes the energy of his style of writing, and the persuasive force of his\r\noratory, to the influence of no other minds: they are the natural fruit\r\nof clear perceptions, a penetrating intellect, an observing mind capable\r\nof taking a wide and comprehensive view of its subject. Men of varied\r\nacquirements and extensive knowledge, but of pedantic taste, are said to\r\ntalk like books; the writings of Cæsar, on the contrary, are like lively\r\nand unconstrained conversation: they have all the reality which\r\nconstitutes the great charm of his character.\r\n\r\nHe was above affectation, for his was a mind born to lead the age in\r\nwhich he lived, not to think with others merely in deference to\r\nestablished usage and custom; and although his natural vanity and\r\nself-confidence led him to set his own character in the most favourable\r\nlight, his vanity was honest: he had no intention wilfully to deceive.\r\nHis wonderful memory fitted him for the task of faithfully recording the\r\nevents in which he himself was an actor; and his power of attention and\r\nabstraction, which enabled him to write, converse, and dictate at the\r\nsame time, shows how valuable must be a work on which were concentrated\r\nat once all the energies of his penetrating mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n  LIFE OF SALLUST—HIS INSINCERITY—HIS HISTORICAL WORKS—HE WAS A BITTER\r\n   OPPONENT OF THE NEW ARISTOCRACY—PROFLIGACY OF THAT ORDER—HIS STYLE\r\n   COMPARED WITH THAT OF THUCYDIDES—HIS VALUE AS AN HISTORIAN—TROGUS\r\n                   POMPEIUS—HIS HISTORIÆ PHILIPPICÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 C. SALLUSTIUS CRISPUS (BORN B. C. 85.)\r\n\r\nC. Sallustius Crispus was fifteen years junior to Cæsar: he was born at\r\nAmiternum[941] in the territory of the Sabines, A. U. C. 669, B. C. 85.\r\nHe was a member of a plebeian family; but, having served the offices of\r\ntribune and quæstor, attained senatorial rank. In A. U. C. 704, he was\r\nexpelled from the senate[942] by the censors Ap. Claudius Pulcher and L.\r\nCalpurnius Piso.[943] It is said that, although he was “a most severe\r\ncensurer of the licentiousness of others,”[944] he was a profligate man\r\nhimself, and that the scandal of an intrigue with Fausta, the daughter\r\nof Sulla and the wife of Milo, was the cause of his degradation.\r\n\r\nThrough the influence of Cæsar, whose party he espoused, he was restored\r\nto his rank, and subsequently became prætor. He accompanied his patron\r\nin the African war, and was made governor of Numidia. Whilst in that\r\ncapacity, he accumulated by rapacity and extortion enormous wealth,[945]\r\nwhich he lavished on expensive but tasteful luxury. The gardens on the\r\nQuirinal which bore his name were celebrated for their beauty; and\r\nbeneath their alleys, and porticoes, surrounded by the choicest works of\r\nart, he avoided the tumultuous scenes of civil strife which ushered in\r\nthe empire, and devoted his retirement to composing the historical\r\nrecords which survived him. His death took place B. C. 35.\r\n\r\nThose who have wished to defend the character of Sallust from the\r\ncharges of immorality, to which allusion has been made, have attributed\r\nthem to the groundless calumnies of Lenæus, a freedman of Cæsar’s great\r\nrival Pompey. It is not improbable that his faults may have been\r\nexaggerated by the malevolence of party-spirit in those factious times;\r\nbut there are no sentiments in his works which can constitute a defence\r\nof him. If an historian is distinguished by a high moral tone of\r\nfeeling, this quality cannot but show itself in his writings without\r\nintention or design. But in Sallust there is always an affectation and\r\npretence of morality without the reality. His philosophical reflections\r\nat the commencement of the Jugurthine and Catilinarian wars are empty,\r\ncold, and heartless. There is a display of commonplace sentiment, and an\r\nexpressed admiration of the old Roman virtue of bygone days, but no\r\nappearance of sincerity. The language may be pointed enough to produce\r\nan effect upon the ear, but the sentiments always fail to probe the\r\nrecesses of the heart. Sallust lived in an immoral and corrupt age; and\r\nthough, perhaps, he was not amongst the worst of his contemporaries, he\r\nhad not sufficient strength of principle to resist the force of example\r\nand temptation.\r\n\r\nIt is almost certain that, as a provincial governor, Sallust was not\r\nmore unscrupulous than others of his class; but wealth such as he\r\npossessed could not have been acquired except by extortion and\r\nmaladministration. As a politician, he was equally unsatisfactory: he\r\nwas a mere partisan of Cæsar, and therefore, a strenuous opponent of the\r\nhigher classes as supporters of Pompey; but he was not an honest\r\nchampion of popular rights, nor was he capable of understanding the\r\nmeaning of patriotism. If, however, we make some allowance for the\r\npolitical bias of Sallust, which is evident throughout his works, his\r\nhistories have not only the charms of the historical romance, but are\r\nalso valuable political studies. His characters are vigorously and\r\nnaturally drawn, as though he not only personally knew them, but\r\naccurately understood them. The more his histories are read the more\r\nwill it be discovered that he always writes with an object. He eschews\r\nthe very idea of a mere dry chronicle of facts, and uses his facts as\r\nthe means of enforcing a great political lesson.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, like Thucydides, whom he evidently took as his model,\r\nnot only in style but in the use of his materials, his speeches are his\r\nown compositions. Even when he had an opportunity, as in the case of\r\nCæsar’s and Cato’s speeches in the “_Bellum Catilinarium_,” he contented\r\nhimself with giving the substance of them, clothed it in his own\r\nlanguage, and imbodied in them his own sentiments. According to his own\r\nstatement, there is one exception to his practice in this respect. He\r\nasserts that the speech of Memmius, the tribune of the people,[946] is\r\nthe very one which he delivered. If this be really the case, it is a\r\nmost valuable example of the style in which a popular leader addressed\r\nhis audience. But it is to be feared that this is not strictly and\r\nliterally true: the style is indeed somewhat different from that of the\r\nother speeches, but does not exhibit freedom enough to assure us that he\r\nhas actually reported it as delivered. It may be only a specimen of that\r\nconsummate skill which constitutes the principal charm of Sallust’s\r\nmanner, and made him a complete master of composition. Sallust never\r\nattempted anything more than detached portions of Roman history. “I have\r\ndetermined,” he says, “to write only select portions of Roman history,”\r\n(carptim perscribere.[947]) He himself gives an explanation of his\r\nmotives for so doing,[948] when he complains of the manner in which this\r\ndepartment of literature was neglected. Wherever a satisfactory account\r\nexisted, he thought it unnecessary to travel over the same ground a\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nHis first work, reckoning according to the chronological order of\r\nevents, is the Jugurthine war, which commenced B. C. 111, and ended\r\nB. C. 106. The next period, comprehending the social war and the war of\r\nSulla, extending as far as the consulship of M. Æmilius Lepidus, B. C.\r\n78, had already been related by Sisenna, a friend of Cicero.[949] Where\r\nSisenna left off, the Histories of Sallust (Historiarum Libri V.) began,\r\nand continued the narrative without interruption until the prætorship of\r\nCicero.[950] This work is unfortunately lost, with the exception of some\r\nletters and speeches, and a few fragments relating to the war of\r\nSpartacus. Niebuhr[951] considers this one of the most deplorable losses\r\nin Roman literature; less, however, on account of its historical\r\nimportance, than as a perfect model of historical composition. A break\r\nof two years ensues, and then follows the “_Bellum Catilinarium_,” or\r\nhistory of the Catilinarian conspiracy in the year of Cicero’s\r\nconsulship.[952]\r\n\r\nThis completes the list of those works which are undoubtedly genuine. No\r\nsatisfactory opinion has been arrived at respecting the authorship of\r\nthe two letters to Cæsar, “_De Republicâ Ordinandâ_;” and it is now\r\nunhesitatingly admitted, that the declamation against Cicero, must have\r\nbeen, as well as its counterpart, the declamation against Sallust, the\r\nwork of some rhetorical writer of a later period. The subject of this\r\nimaginary disputation was naturally suggested by the known fact that\r\nSallust was no friend to Cicero.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that Sallust was a bitter opponent of the\r\nprinciples and policy of the aristocratic party; but it must be\r\ncarefully explained what is meant by that assertion. The object of his\r\nhatred was not the old patrician blood of Rome, but the new aristocracy,\r\nwhich had of late years been rapidly rising up and displacing it.\r\n\r\nThis new nobility was utterly corrupt; and their corruption was\r\nencouraged by the venality of the masses, whose poverty and destitution\r\ntempted them to be the tools of unscrupulous ambition. Everything at\r\nRome, as Juvenal said in later times, had its price. Sallust adds to the\r\nseverity of his strictures upon his countrymen by the force of contrast;\r\nhe represents even Jugurtha as asserting that the republic itself might\r\nbe bought, if a purchaser could be found; and paints the barbarian as\r\nmore honest and upright than his conquerors. The ruined and abandoned\r\nassociates of Catiline represented a numerous class among the younger\r\nmembers of the upper classes, who, by lives devoted to lawless\r\npleasures, had become ruined, reckless, and demoralized. They were ripe\r\nfor revolution, because they had nothing to lose: they could not gratify\r\ntheir vicious propensities without wealth; they had no principles or\r\nscruples as to the means of acquiring it; their best prospects were in\r\nanarchy, proscription, and confiscation. The debauched and ruined\r\nnobleman, and the vulgar profligate of the lowest class, forgot their\r\nmutual differences, and thus a combination was formed, the members of\r\nwhich were the sink and outscourings of society.\r\n\r\nSuch degenerate profligacy is an ample justification of Sallust’s hatred\r\ntowards the new aristocracy; and the object of all his works evidently\r\nwas to place that party in the unfavourable light which it deserved. In\r\nthe Jugurthine war he describes the unworthiness of the foreign policy\r\nof Rome under its maladministration. His “Histories,” according to the\r\nstatement of Niebuhr, describe the popular resistance to the\r\nrevolutionary policy of Sulla, the profligate leader of the same party;\r\nand in the “Catilinarian war” he paints in vivid colours the depravity\r\nof that order of society, who, bankrupt in fortune and dead to all\r\nhonourable feelings, still plumed themselves on their rank and\r\nexclusiveness. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the truthfulness of the\r\npicture which Sallust draws, selfishness and not patriotism was the\r\nmainspring of his politics; and it is scarcely possible to avoid seeing\r\nthat he is anxious to set himself off to the best advantage. His\r\nhollowness is that of a vain and conceited man, who measures himself by\r\ntoo high a standard, and appears chagrined and disappointed that others\r\ndo not estimate him as highly as he does himself.\r\n\r\nThese are the blots in his character as a man and a citizen; but we must\r\nnot forget his real merits as an historian. To him must be conceded the\r\npraise of having first conceived the notion of a history in the true\r\nsense of the term. He saw the lamentable defects in the abortive\r\nattempts made by his predecessors;[953] and the model was a good one\r\nwhich he left for his successors to follow. It is scarcely too much to\r\nsuppose, that if it had not been for Sallust, Livy might not have been\r\nled to conceive his vast and comprehensive plan. He was the first Roman\r\nhistorian, and the guide to future historians. Again, his style,\r\nalthough almost ostentatiously elaborate and artificial, and not without\r\naffectation, is, upon the whole, pleasing, and almost always\r\ntransparently clear. The caution of Quintilian respecting his well-known\r\nbrevity (“vitanda est illa Sallustiana brevitas”[954]) is well-timed in\r\nhis work, as being addressed to orators, for public speaking necessarily\r\nrequires a more diffuse style; and it is probable that Quintilian would\r\nnot appreciate its merits, because he himself was a rhetorician, and his\r\ntaste was formed in a rhetorical age. Seneca, for the same reasons,\r\nfinds similar faults, not only with Sallust, but with the favourite\r\nliterature of his day. “When Sallust flourished, abrupt sentences,\r\nunexpected cadences, obscure expressions, were considered signs of a\r\ncultivated taste.”[955] But the brevity of Sallust does not produce the\r\neffect of harsh or disagreeable abruptness, whilst it keeps the\r\nattention awake, and impresses the facts upon the memory. How powerful\r\nand suggestive, for example, how abundant in material for thought, are\r\nthose few words in which he describes Pompey as “oris probi, animo\r\ninverecundo!” There is, however, this difference between the brevity of\r\nSallust and that of his supposed model, Thucydides. That of the Greek\r\nhistorian was natural and involuntary; that of the Roman intentional and\r\nthe result of imitation. Thucydides thought more quickly than he could\r\nwrite: his closely-packed ideas and condensed constructions, therefore,\r\nconstitute a species of shorthand, by which alone he could keep pace\r\nwith the rapidity of his intellect. He is, therefore, always vigorous\r\nand suggestive; and the necessities of the case make the reader readily\r\npardon the difficulties of his style.\r\n\r\nThe brevity of Thucydides is the result of condensation; that of Sallust\r\nis elliptical expression. He gives a hint and the reader must supply the\r\nrest; whilst Thucydides only expects his readers to unfold and develop\r\nideas which already existed in a concentrated form. Sallust requires\r\naddition; Thucydides dilution and expansion. Neither does the brevity of\r\nSallust resemble that of Cæsar or of Tacitus: the former was\r\nstraight-forward and business-like, requiring neither addition nor\r\nexpansion, because he wished to make his statements as clear as they\r\nwere capable of being expressed, without ornament or exaggeration. He\r\nwas brief, because he never wished to say more than was absolutely\r\nnecessary, and therefore his brevity is the very cause of perspicuity.\r\nThe mind of Tacitus was, from its thoughtfulness and philosophical\r\ncharacter, the very counterpart of that of Thucydides: his brevity was\r\ntherefore natural and the result of the same causes.\r\n\r\nThere is one point of view in which Sallust is invaluable as an\r\nhistorian. He had always an object to which he wished all his facts to\r\nconverge: he brought forward his facts as illustrations and developments\r\nof principles. He analyzed and exposed the motives of parties, and the\r\nsecret springs which actuated the conduct of individuals, and laid bare\r\nthe inner life of those great actors on the public stage, in the\r\ninteresting historical scenes which he undertakes to describe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            TROGUS POMPEIUS.\r\n\r\nTrogus Pompeius was a voluminous historian of the Augustan age, whose\r\nfather was private secretary to Julius Cæsar.[956] His work was of such\r\nvast extent, and embraced so great a variety of subjects, that it has\r\neven been termed by Justin, who published a large collection of extracts\r\nfrom it, _an Universal History_. Its title, however, “_Historiæ\r\nPhilippicæ_,” proves the writer’s primary object was the history of the\r\nMacedonian monarchy, together with the kingdoms which arose out of it at\r\nthe death of Alexander; and that all the rest of the information\r\ncontained in it were digressions into which he was naturally led, and\r\nepisodes incidentally introduced into the main stream of the history.\r\n\r\nFor the materials contained in his work, which consisted of forty-four\r\nbooks, he was indebted to the Greek historians, but especially to\r\nTheopompus of Chios,[957] from whose principal work he derived the\r\ntitle, “_Philippica_,” as well as the practice of branching out into\r\nlong and frequent digressions. It is easy to imagine over how vast an\r\narea a history of the Macedonian empire was capable of extending. The\r\nsubjugation of the East by the conquests of Alexander naturally made a\r\nrapid sketch of the Assyrian, Median, and Persian empires, an\r\nappropriate introduction to the work: the connexion of Persia with\r\nGreece and Egypt furnished an opportunity of imbodying the records of\r\nGreek history, and a description of Egypt and its inhabitants. Once\r\nembarked in Greek history, the writer pursued it until it became\r\ninterwoven, through the interference of Philip, with the affairs of\r\nMacedon. Alexander and his successors succeed: the campaigns of Pyrrhus\r\nbring the Romans upon the stage; Carthage and Sicily for awhile occupy\r\nthe scene; and the main body of the work is completed by a sketch of the\r\ngradual consolidation of that vast empire, of which subjugated Macedonia\r\nbecame a province. Nor is this all—other less important nations, states,\r\nand cities are ever and anon introduced, according as they act their\r\npart in the great drama of history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n     LIFE OF LIVY—HIS OBJECT IN WRITING HIS HISTORY—ITS SPIRIT AND\r\n CHARACTER—LIVY PRECISELY SUITED TO HIS AGE—NOT WILFULLY INACCURATE—HIS\r\nPOLITICAL BIAS ACCOUNTED FOR—MATERIALS WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE USED—SOURCES\r\n             OF HIS HISTORY—HIS DEFECTS AS AN HISTORIAN—HIS\r\n STYLE—GRAMMARIANS—VITRUVIUS POLLIO AN AUGUSTAN WRITER—CONTENTS OF HIS\r\n                                 WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  T. LIVIUS PATAVINUS (BORN B. C. 59.)\r\n\r\nThe biographical records of many great literary men of Rome are most\r\nmeager and unsatisfactory. Modern critics who have written their lives\r\nhave drawn largely upon their own imaginations for their materials;\r\nwhilst all the information to be derived from ancient writers is often\r\ncomprised in a few vague allusions and notices. Some of these have been\r\nmisunderstood, and from others unwarrantable deductions have been\r\nderived. These observations are particularly applicable to him who is\r\nthe only illustrious Roman historian in the Augustan age.\r\n\r\nUniversal tradition assigns to Patavium (Padua) the honour of being the\r\nbirthplace of Titus Livius; but notwithstanding the general belief, some\r\ndoubt has been thrown upon the fact by an epigram of Martial.[958] He\r\ncame to Rome during the reign of Augustus, where he resided in the\r\nenjoyment of the imperial favour and patronage.[959] He was a warm and\r\nopen admirer of the ancient institutions of the country, and esteemed\r\nPompey as one of its greatest heroes; but Augustus, with his usual\r\nliberality, did not allow political opinions to interfere with the\r\nregard which he entertained for the historian. Livy had a great\r\nadmiration for oratory, and advised his son to study the writings of\r\nDemosthenes and Cicero.[960] At his recommendation the stupid Claudius\r\nwrote history;[961] and it has even been asserted, though on\r\ninsufficient authority, that he was his instructor. His fame rapidly\r\nspread beyond the limits of Italy, for Pliny the younger[962] relates\r\nthat an inhabitant of Cadiz came to Rome for the express purpose of\r\nseeing him; a fact which St. Jerome[963] expands into an assertion that\r\nmany noble Gauls and Spaniards were attracted to the capital, far more\r\nby the reputation of Livy than by the splendour of the imperial city.\r\n\r\nHis great work is a history of Rome, which he modestly terms “Annals,”\r\nin one hundred and forty-two books, preceded by a brief but\r\nelaborately-written preface,[964] and extending from the earliest\r\ntraditions to the death of Drusus.[965] Of this history thirty-five\r\nbooks are extant, which were discovered at different periods.[966] Of\r\nthe rest we have only dry and meager epitomes, drawn up by some\r\nuncertain author, and of these two are lost.[967]\r\n\r\nBesides his History, Livy is said[968] to have written books which\r\nprofessed to be philosophical, and dialogues, the subjects of which are\r\npartly philosophical, and partly historical. Late in life he returned to\r\nPatavium, and there died A. D. 18, in the seventy-seventh year of his\r\nage.[969] He left one son, and one daughter who married L. Magius, a\r\nteacher of rhetoric, of no great talent, who owed his reputation\r\nprincipally to his connexion with the historian.[970] Livy had one great\r\nobject in view in writing his History, namely, to celebrate the glories\r\nof his native country, to which he was devotedly attached. He was a\r\npatriot: his sympathy was with Pompey, called forth by the\r\ndisinterestedness of that great man, and perhaps by his sad end, after\r\nhaving so long enjoyed universal popularity. The character of the\r\nhistorian would lead us to suppose that his attachment was personal\r\nrather than political, for the general spirit of his work shows that he\r\nwas a man of pure mind and gentle feelings. He began his great work\r\nabout nine or ten years before the Christian era, a period singularly\r\nfavourable for such a design. The passages in which especially he\r\ndelights to put forth his powers, and on which he dwells with the\r\ngreatest zest, show the truth of Quintilian’s well-known criticism,\r\n“that he is especially the historian of the affections, particularly of\r\nthe softer sensibilities.”[971] A lost battle is misery to him; he\r\ntrembles at the task of relating it. Nor does he appear to have been a\r\nstern republican. He could admire enthusiastically, and describe with\r\nspirit, the noble qualities and self-devotion which the old republican\r\nfreedom fostered; but his object is rather to paint the heroes, and to\r\ngive graphic representations of the struggles which they maintained in\r\ndefence of liberty, than to show any love of liberty in the abstract, or\r\na predilection for any particular form of constitution. To Livy\r\npolitical struggles were no more than subjects for picturesque\r\ndelineations, the moral of which was the elevation of national grandeur,\r\njust as successful foreign wars were the records of national glory.\r\nHence he is a biographer quite as much as an historian: he anatomizes\r\nthe moral nature of his heroes, and shows their inner man, and the\r\nmotive springs of their noble exploits. This gives to his narratives the\r\ncharm of an historical romance, and makes up for the want of accurate\r\nresearch and political observation. His characters stand before us\r\nobjectively, like epic heroes; and thus he is “the Homer of the Roman\r\npeople,” whilst the charm of his narratives makes him the “Herodotus of\r\nRoman historians.”\r\n\r\nRome was now the mistress of the world: her struggles with foreign\r\nnations had been rewarded with universal dominion; so that when the\r\nRoman empire was spoken of, no title less comprehensive than “the world”\r\n(_orbis_) would satisfy the national vanity. The horrors of civil war\r\nhad ceased, and were succeeded by an amnesty of its bitter feuds and\r\nbloody animosities. Liberty indeed had perished, but the people were no\r\nlonger fit for the enjoyment of it; and it was exchanged for a mild and\r\npaternal rule, under which all the refinements of civilization were\r\nencouraged, and its subjects could enjoy undisturbed the blessings of\r\npeace and security.\r\n\r\nRome, therefore, had rest and breathing-time to look back into the\r\npast—to trace the successive steps by which that marvellous edifice, the\r\nRoman empire, had been constructed. She could do this, too, with perfect\r\nself-complacency, for there was no symptom of decay to check her\r\nexultation, or to mar the glories which she was contemplating.\r\n\r\nLivy, the good, the affectionate, the romantic, was precisely the\r\npopular historian for such times as these. His countrymen looked\r\nnaturally for panegyric rather than for criticism. They were not in a\r\ntemper to bear one who could remorselessly tear open and expose to view\r\nall the faults and blemishes which blotted the pages of their history;\r\nwho could be a morose and querulous praiser of times gone by, never to\r\nreturn, at the expense of their present greatness and prosperity. He\r\nlived in happy times, before Rome had learnt by sad experience what the\r\ntyranny of absolutism really was. He tells his story like a bard singing\r\nhis lay at a joyous and festive meeting, chequered by alternate\r\nsuccesses and reverses, prosperity and adversity, but all tending to a\r\nhappy end at last. These features of his character, and this object of\r\nhis work, whilst they constitute his peculiar charm as a narrator,\r\nobviously render him less valuable as an historian. Although he was not\r\ntasteless and spiritless, like Dionysius, he was not so trustworthy. He\r\nwould not be wilfully inaccurate, or otherwise than truth-telling; but\r\nif the legend he was about to tell was captivating and interesting, he\r\nwould not stop to inquire whether or not it was true. He would take upon\r\ntrust the traditions which had been handed down from generation to\r\ngeneration without inquiry; and the more flattering and popular they\r\nwere, the more suitable would he deem them for his purpose. Without\r\nbeing himself necessarily superstitious, he would see that superstitious\r\nmarvels added to the embellishments of his story, and, therefore, would\r\naccept them without pronouncing upon their truth or falsehood.\r\n\r\nWilful unfairness can never be attributed to Livy: he was prejudiced,\r\nbut he was not party-spirited. He loved his country and his countrymen,\r\nand could scarcely persuade himself of the possibility of their doing\r\nwrong. He could scarcely believe anything derogatory to the national\r\nglory. When (to take a striking example,) in the case of the treaty with\r\nPorsena, there were two opposite stories, he was led by this partiality\r\nto ignore the well-authenticated fact of the capture of Rome, and to\r\nadopt that account which was most creditable to his countrymen.[972]\r\nWhenever Rome was false to treaties, unmerciful in victory, or\r\nunsuccessful in arms, he is always anxious to find excuses. His\r\npredilections are evidently aristocratic; and although he states the\r\nfacts fairly, he wishes his reader to sympathize with the patricians.\r\n\r\nThe plebeians of the days in which he lived were not the fair\r\nrepresentatives of that enterprising class in the early ages of the\r\nrepublic, who were as well born as the patricians, although of different\r\nblood; the strength and sinews of the state in its exhausting\r\nwars—dependent only upon them from stern necessity, because they were\r\nground down to the dust by poverty, and debt, and oppression, but\r\nindependently maintaining themselves by their own industry, gradually\r\nacquiring wealth, rising to the position of a middle class, winning\r\ntheir way perseveringly, step by step, to political privileges.\r\n\r\nThe lower orders of Rome, in the time of Livy—for the term plebeian, in\r\nits original sense, was no longer applicable—were debased and degraded;\r\nthey cared not for liberty or political power, or self-government; their\r\nbosoms throbbed not with sympathy for the old plebeians, who retired to\r\nMount Sacer, and shed their blood for their principles. It was\r\ndifficult, therefore, for him not to believe that the popular leaders of\r\nold times were unprincipled men, who sought to repair their fortunes by\r\nthe arts of the demagogue. In his eyes resistance to tyranny was treason\r\nand rebellion.[973] But when, as in the story of Virginia, his gentler\r\naffections were enlisted, Livy’s heart warmed with a generous admiration\r\ntowards the champions of the people’s rights, and his political\r\npredilections gave way to his sensibilities. In treating of history\r\nalmost contemporaneous, Tacitus confesses his liberality. Although it\r\nmight have rendered him more acceptable at the court of his patron if he\r\nhad vilified his political foes, yet even imperial favour, acting on the\r\nsame side as political prejudice, did not tempt him to unfairness.[974]\r\nHe could see and acknowledge noble qualities and disinterested\r\npatriotism, and give credit for sincere motives, even to those who\r\ndiffered in political opinions.\r\n\r\nFrom a character such as has been described, much care is not to be\r\nexpected as to the sources from which historical information was\r\nderived. Many original documents must have existed in his day, which he\r\nevidently never took the trouble to consult. A rich treasure of original\r\nmonuments relating to foreign and domestic affairs were ready at hand,\r\nwhich might have been examined without much trouble.[975] The great\r\nAnnals of the Pontifex Maximus were digested into eighty books; and\r\nthese contained the names of the magistrates, all memorable events at\r\nhome and abroad—even the very days on which they occurred being marked.\r\nThe commentaries not only of the priests and augurs, but of the civil\r\nmagistrates, were kept with exactness and regularity. There is no reason\r\nfor supposing that the _Libri Lintei_[976] were lost in Livy’s time,\r\nalthough he quotes from Licinius Macer,[977] instead of consulting them\r\nhimself. Three thousand brazen tablets, on which were engraved acts of\r\nthe senate and the plebeians, extending backwards (says Suetonius[978])\r\nalmost to the building of the city, existed in the Capitol until it was\r\nburnt in the reign of Vespasian. The corpus of civil law, which is known\r\nto have existed in the time of Cicero,[979] was full of antiquarian\r\nlore; and the twelve tables furnished invaluable information, not only\r\non language, but on the manners and habits of bygone times. Nevertheless\r\nthe fragments of the _Leges Regiæ_ and the laws of the twelve tables\r\nhave been more carefully examined by critics of modern times than they\r\nwere by Livy, when they existed in a more perfect condition.\r\n\r\nLachmann[980] has satisfactorily shown that the assertions of Livy are\r\nnot based upon personal investigation, but that he trusted to the\r\nannalists, and took advantage of the researches of preceding historians.\r\nThis is all that he himself professes to do; and even these professions\r\nhe does not always satisfactorily perform. He does not appear to have\r\nprofited by the Annals of Varro or the _Origines_ of Cato, a work which,\r\naccording to the testimony of Cicero, must have been invaluable to an\r\nhistorian; and although the Archæologia of Dionysius were published\r\nabout the time at which Livy commenced his history,[981] there is no\r\nevidence that he makes use of it; certainly he never acknowledges any\r\nobligation to the indefatigable researches of the Greek historian.\r\nAccording to his own confession,[982] Roman history is total darkness\r\nuntil the capture of Rome by the Gauls; and although a dim light then\r\nbegins to break, a twilight period succeeds, which continues until the\r\nfirst Punic war. But it cannot be asserted that he prepared himself for\r\nhis difficult task as he ought, or took advantage of all the means at\r\nhis disposal to enlighten the obscurity in which his subject was\r\ninvolved. The authorities on which he principally depends for the\r\ncontents of the first Decade were such as Ennius, Fab. Pictor, Cincius,\r\nand Piso. It is evident that he also consulted Greek writers. In the\r\nthird, which contains the most beautiful and elaborate passages of the\r\nwhole work, he follows Polybius. Nor could he, in this portion of his\r\nhistory, follow a safer one. The Romans, notwithstanding all their\r\npractical tendencies, did little to promote geographical science. It is\r\namongst the Greeks that we find the most accurate and indefatigable\r\ngeographers, such as were Polybius, Strabo, and Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nPolybius prepared himself for the task of narrating the Italian campaign\r\nof Hannibal by personal inspection. Livy did nothing of the kind. The\r\nformer travelled through the Alpine passes; and his authority was\r\nconsidered so good that Strabo implicitly followed him. It is to be\r\nlamented that, as he was writing to his countrymen, he seldom mentions\r\nthe name of places; probably he thought they would not be the wiser for\r\nthe enumeration of unknown barbarian names. But his accuracy in dates\r\nand distances enables us to trace Hannibal’s route with correctness.\r\nThese prove that the passage of Hannibal was by the Alpis Graia, the\r\nLittle St. Bernard; a statement which had been made by that\r\nveracious[983] historian, Cælius Antipater, and also by Cornelius\r\nNepos.[984] It has been since confirmed by the researches of modern\r\ntravellers, such as General Melville, M. de Luc, Cramer, and Wickham.\r\nStrange to say, Livy, although following the route marked out by\r\nPolybius almost step by step, at length ends it with the Alpis Cottia\r\n(M. Genevre.) The absence of names left the fireside traveller at fault.\r\nCæsar[985] had crossed the Alps by that pass; and, perhaps, Livy named\r\nit at a venture, as the most familiar to him. In the succeeding portions\r\nof his work, so complete is the confidence which he reposes upon the\r\nguidance of Polybius, that the fourth and fifth Decades are little more\r\nthan the history of Polybius paraphrased.\r\n\r\nNiebuhr,[986] from internal evidence, gives an interesting account of\r\nthe manner in which it is probable that Livy wrote his history. He\r\nsupposes that, like most of the ancients, he employed a secretary, who\r\nread to him from existing authorities the events of a single year. These\r\nthe historian mentally arranged, and then dictated his own narrative.\r\nThe work, therefore, was composed in portions; the connexion of the\r\nevents of one year with those of the preceding one was lost sight of,\r\nand thus they seem isolated; and the conclusion of a series of events\r\nsometimes unaccountably synchronizes with the conclusion of a year.\r\n\r\nTo his deficiencies in the habit of diligent and accurate investigation\r\nare added others which singularly disqualify him for the task of a\r\nfaithful historian. He was a reader of books rather than a student of\r\nmen and things; he took upon trust what other people told him, instead\r\nof acquiring knowledge in a practical manner. He was ill-acquainted with\r\nthe history of foreign countries. He was not, like Cæsar, a soldier; and\r\ntherefore his descriptions of military affairs are often vague and\r\nindistinct, for he did not understand the tactics which he professed to\r\ndescribe. He was not, like Thucydides, a politician or a philosopher;\r\nand hence the little trustworthy information which we derive from him on\r\nquestions connected with constitutional changes. He did not fit himself,\r\nlike Herodotus, by travelling; and thus he is often ignorant of the\r\nlocalities which he describes, even though they are within the limits of\r\nItaly. Hence the difficulties in the way of understanding the route of\r\nHannibal and his army across the Alps, the battle of Thrasimene, and the\r\ndefeat at the Caudine Forks. He was not a philosopher, a lawyer, or a\r\npolitician: he could embrace with the eye and depict with the hand of an\r\nartist everything which was external and tangible; but he could not\r\npenetrate the secret motives which actuate the human will, nor form a\r\nclear conception of the fundamental, legal and political principles\r\nwhich animated the institutions, and gave rise to the peculiarities, of\r\nRoman constitutional history.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the speeches which he attributes to his principal\r\nheroes, a greater degree of accuracy cannot be expected, than is found\r\nin those of Thucydides. But they do not possess that verisimilitude\r\nwhich is so admirable in those of the Greek historian. As works of art\r\nthey are faultless, but Livy does not keep in view the principle adhered\r\nto by Thucydides, that they should be such as the speakers were likely\r\nto have delivered on the occasions in question. His great authority,\r\nPolybius, disapproves of imaginary speeches altogether;[987] but it must\r\nbe remembered that, without some oratorical display, he would not have\r\npleased the Roman people. The speeches of Thucydides, although they bear\r\nthe stamp of the writer’s mind, are, to a certain extent, characteristic\r\nof the speaker, and seem inspired by the occasion. If a Spartan speaks,\r\nhe is laconic; if a general, he is soldier-like; if a statesman or\r\ndemagogue, he is logical or argumentative, or appeals to the feelings\r\nand passions of the Athenian people. Consistency produces variety. The\r\nspeeches of Livy are pleasing and eloquent,[988] but they are always, so\r\nto speak, Livian; they are frequently not such as Romans would have\r\nspoken in times when eloquence was rude, though forcible. They partake\r\nof the rhetorical and declamatory spirit, which was already beginning to\r\ncreep over Roman literature; and often, from being unsuitable to time,\r\nplace, and person, diminish, instead of heightening, the dramatic\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal defects which cause us to regret that, whilst\r\nLivy charms us with his romantic narratives and almost faultless style,\r\nhe is too often a fallacious guide as an historian, and gives, not\r\nintentionally or dishonestly, but from the character of his mind, and\r\nthe object which he proposed to himself, a false colouring or a vague\r\nand inaccurate outline to the events which he narrates. No one can avoid\r\nrelishing the liveliness, freshness, and “lactea ubertas,” of Livy’s\r\nfascinating style; but its principal excellence is summed up in the\r\nexpression of Quintilian, “_clarissimus candor_,” (brightness and\r\nlucidity.[989]) On the authority of Asinius Pollio, quoted by the same\r\nwriter,[990] a certain fault has been attributed to him, termed\r\n“Patavinity,” _i. e._, some peculiar ideas not admissible in the purest\r\nLatin, which mark the place of his nativity. So little pains do people\r\ntake in the investigation of truth, and so ready are they to take upon\r\ntrust what their predecessors have believed before them, that generation\r\nafter generation have assumed that Livy’s clear, eloquent, and\r\ntransparent style is disfigured by what we term provincialisms.[991] The\r\npenetrating mind of Niebuhr finds no ground for believing the story. If\r\nthere is any truth in it, he supposes the criticism must have applied to\r\nhis speaking, and not to his writing.[992] His style is always\r\nclassical, even in the later decades: though prolix and tautologous, it\r\nis invariably marked by idiomatic purity and grammatical accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              GRAMMARIANS.\r\n\r\nThe grammarians may be passed over with little more notice than the\r\nsimple mention of their names, because, although they contributed to the\r\nstock of their country’s literature, they added little or nothing to its\r\nliterary reputation. The most conspicuous amongst them were—Atteius\r\nPhilologus, a freedman and friend of Sallust; Staberius Eros, who taught\r\nBrutus and Cassius; Q. Cæcilius Epirota, the correspondent of Cicero; C.\r\nJulius Hyginus, a Spaniard, the friend of Ovid, and curator of the\r\nPalatine library; Verrius Flaccus, the tutor to the grandsons of\r\nAugustus; Q. Cornificius, who was augur at the same time with Cicero;\r\nand P. Nigidius Figulus, an orator and philosopher as well as a\r\ngrammarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          M. VITRUVIUS POLLIO.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished name of M. Vitruvius Pollio claims a place in a\r\ncatalogue of the Augustan writers. His subject, indeed, belongs to the\r\napartment of the fine arts; but his varied acquirements and extensive\r\nknowledge, as well as the manner in which, notwithstanding some faults,\r\nhe treats his subject, shed some lustre upon Roman literature, and stamp\r\nhim as one of the didactic writers of his country.\r\n\r\nLittle information exists respecting this celebrated architect; and this\r\ncircumstance has led to his being confounded with another professor of\r\nthe same art, L. Vitruvius Cerdo. The name of the latter is thus\r\ninscribed on an arch, which was his work, at Verona:[993] “Q. Vitruvius\r\nL. L. Cerdo, Architectus.” That Cerdo was not the author of the treatise\r\nextant under the name of Vitruvius, may be satisfactorily\r\nproved:—Firstly. The letters L. L. signify that he was Lucii Libertus\r\n(the freedman of Lucius,) whereas M. Vitruvius Pollio was born free.\r\nSecondly. The arch on which the name appears belongs to an age when the\r\nRomans had begun, in defiance of the precepts of Pollio, to neglect the\r\nprinciples of Greek architecture.[994]\r\n\r\nBoth the place and date of his birth are unknown. According to some\r\nauthorities he was born at Verona; according to others at Formiæ;[995]\r\nbut he himself asserts that he received a good liberal education; and\r\nthe truth of this statement is confirmed by the knowledge which he\r\ndisplays of Greek and Roman literature, and his acquaintance with works\r\nwhich treat, not only of architecture, but also of polite learning and\r\neven philosophy[996]—the writings, for example, of Lucretius, Cicero,\r\nand Varro. But the great object of his studies was, undoubtedly,\r\nprofessional, and to this he made literature a handmaid.\r\n\r\nVitruvius served under Julius Cæsar in Africa as a military engineer;\r\nand was subsequently employed by one of the emperors, to whom his\r\ntreatise is dedicated, in the direction and control of that department\r\nof the public service. By his favour, and the kindness of his sister, he\r\nwas thus placed in a condition, if not of affluence, at least of\r\ncompetency. Who his imperial patron was has been disputed; but the\r\nwidely extended conquests, the augmentation of the empire, the political\r\ninstitutions, and, moreover, the taste for architecture which Vitruvius\r\nattributes to him, renders it most probable that it was Augustus, the\r\nsovereign who found the city of bricks and left it of marble. It is\r\nclear that his work was written after the death of Julius Cæsar, and not\r\nlater than that of Titus, for the former he prefixes the word Divus,\r\nwhilst he does not mention the Coliseum; and, although he speaks of\r\nVesuvius,[997] he is evidently not aware of any eruptions having taken\r\nplace except in ancient times. Notwithstanding the arguments adduced by\r\nW. Newton[998] to prove that he wrote in the reign of Titus, it is now\r\nuniversally admitted that Vitruvius was a writer of the Augustan age.\r\nThe inferiority of his style to that of his contemporaries, its\r\noccasional obscurity and want of method, the not unfrequent occurrence\r\nof inelegant, and even barbarous expressions, notwithstanding his\r\nclassical education, may be accounted for by what has already been\r\nstated respecting the professional object of all his studies. He himself\r\nclaims indulgence on this score,[999] and states that he writes as an\r\narchitect, and not as a literary man. So much of its difficulty as\r\narises from conciseness he considers a matter for boasting rather than\r\napology.\r\n\r\nIn forming an estimate of the Latinity of an author like Vitruvius, it\r\nmust not be forgotten that our taste is formed by authority and by a\r\nstudy of the best models. Novelty is exceptional, and therefore\r\ndispleases. But technical subjects render not only the introduction of\r\nnew terms necessary, but even, owing to the poverty of language, awkward\r\nperiphrases and obscure phraseology. Nevertheless, upon the whole, the\r\nlanguage of Vitruvius is vigorous, his descriptions bold, and seem the\r\nwork of a true and correct hand, and a practised draughtsman.\r\n\r\nHis work consists of ten books, in which he treats of the whole subject\r\nin a systematic and orderly manner.\r\n\r\nThe following are its principal contents:—A general view of the science\r\nand of the education suitable to an architect; the choice of sites; the\r\narrangement of the buildings and fortifications of a city;[1000] an\r\ninteresting essay on the earliest human dwellings, building\r\nmaterials,[1001] temples, altars,[1002] forums, basilicæ, treasuries,\r\njails, court-houses, baths, palæstræ, harbours, theatres, together with\r\ntheir acoustic principles, and the theory of musical sounds and\r\nharmonies.[1003] Private dwellings, both in town and country;[1004]\r\ndecoration;[1005] water, and the means of supply;[1006] chronometrical\r\ninstruments;[1007] surveying[1008] and engineering, both civil and\r\nmilitary.\r\n\r\nHis work is valuable as a conspectus of the principles of Greek\r\narchitectural taste and beauty, of which he was a devoted admirer, and\r\nfrom which he would not willingly have permitted any deviation. But he\r\nwas evidently deficient in the knowledge of the principles of Greek\r\narchitectural construction.[1009] His taste was pure, too pure probably\r\nfor the Romans; for, notwithstanding his theoretical excellence, we have\r\nno evidence of his being employed, practically, as an architect, except\r\nin the case of the Basilica,[1010] at Colonia Julia Fanestris, now Fano,\r\nnear Ancona.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BOOK III.\r\n                          ERA OF THE DECLINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n     DECLINE OF ROMAN LITERATURE—IT BECAME DECLAMATORY—BIOGRAPHY OF\r\nPHÆDRUS—GENUINENESS OF HIS FABLES—MORAL AND POLITICAL LESSONS INCULCATED\r\n       IN THEM—SPECIMENS OF FABLES—FABLES SUGGESTED BY HISTORICAL\r\n EVENTS—SEJANUS AND TIBERIUS—EPOCH UNFAVOURABLE TO LITERATURE—INGENUITY\r\n     OF PHÆDRUS—SUPERIORITY OF ÆSOP—THE STYLE OF PHÆDRUS CLASSICAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the death of Augustus[1011] commenced the decline of Roman\r\nliterature, and only three illustrious names, Phædrus, Persius, and\r\nLucan, rescue the first years of this period from the charge of a\r\ncorrupt and vitiated taste. After awhile, indeed, political\r\ncircumstances again became more favourable—the dangers which paralyzed\r\ngenius and talent, and prevented their free exercise under Tiberius and\r\nhis tyrannical successors, diminished, and a more liberal system of\r\nadministration ensued under Vespasian and Titus. Juvenal and Tacitus\r\nthen stood forth as the representatives of the old Roman independence;\r\nvigour of thought communicated itself to the language; a taste for the\r\nsublime and beautiful to a certain extent revived, although it did not\r\nattain to the perfection which shed a lustre over the Augustan age.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of the first literature of this epoch was declamation\r\nand rhetoric. As liberty declined, true natural eloquence gradually\r\ndecayed. When it is no longer necessary or even possible to persuade or\r\nconvince the people, that eloquence which calms the passions, wins the\r\naffections, or appeals to common sense and the reasoning powers, has no\r\nopportunity for exercise. Its object is a new one—namely, to please and\r\nattract an audience who listen in a mere critical spirit: the weapons\r\nwhich it makes use of are novelty and ingenuity; novelty soon becomes\r\nstrangeness, and strangeness exaggeration; whilst ingenuity implies\r\nunnatural study and a display of pedantic erudition—the aiming at\r\nstartling and striking effects—and at length ends in affectation.\r\n\r\nIf this was the prevailing false taste under the immediate successors of\r\nAugustus, it is not surprising that it affected poetry as well as prose;\r\nand that the principal talent of the poet lay in florid and diffuse\r\ndescriptions, whilst his chief fault was a style overladen with\r\nornament. The tragedies ascribed to Seneca are theatrical declamations;\r\nthe satires of Persius are philosophical declamations; whilst the poems\r\nof Lucan and Silius Italicus, though epic in form, are nothing more than\r\ndescriptive poems, and their style is rather rhetorical than poetical.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PHÆDRUS.\r\n\r\nFable had been long known and popular amongst the Romans before the time\r\nof Phædrus. Livy could not have attributed the well-known one to\r\nMenenius Agrippa, unless it had been a familiar tradition of long\r\nstanding. Fables amused the guests of Horace, and furnished subjects to\r\nthose of Ovid. In this, as in other fields of literature, Rome was an\r\nimitator of Greece; but nevertheless the Roman fabulist struck out a new\r\nline for himself, and in his hands fable became, not only a moral\r\ninstructor, but a severe political satirist. Phædrus, the originator and\r\nonly author of Roman fable, flourished on the common confines of the\r\ngolden and the silver age. His mode of thought, as well as the events\r\nwhich suggested both his original illustrations and his adaptations of\r\nthe Æsopean stories, belong to that epoch of transition. His works are,\r\nas it were, isolated: he has no contemporaries. Although he was born in\r\nthe reign of Augustus, he wrote when the Augustan age had passed away.\r\nNevertheless his solitary voice was lifted up when those of the poet,\r\nthe historian, and the philosopher were silenced.\r\n\r\nPhædrus, like Horace, is his own biographer; and the only knowledge\r\nwhich we have respecting his life is furnished by his Fables. In the\r\nprologue to the third book he informs us that he was a native of Thrace:\r\n“I,” he says, “to whom my mother gave birth on the Pierian hill—\r\n\r\n                 Ego quem Pierio mater enixa est jugo.”\r\n\r\nAnd, again, he exclaims, “Why should I, who am nearer to lettered\r\nGreece, desert for slothful indolence the honour of my fatherland, when\r\nThrace can reckon up her poets, and Apollo is the parent of Linus, the\r\nmuse of Orpheus, who by his song endowed rocks with motion, tamed the\r\nwild beasts, and stopped the rapid Hebrus with welcome delay?—\r\n\r\n                Ego literatæ qui sum propior Græciæ,\r\n                Cur somno inerti deseram patriæ decus;\r\n                Threïssa cum gens numeret auctores suos,\r\n                Linoque Apollo sit parens, Musa Orpheo\r\n                Qui saxa cantu movit, et domuit feras,\r\n                Hebrique tenuit impetus dulci morâ?”\r\n\r\nFrom the title, “Augusti Libertus,” prefixed to his fables, it is clear\r\nthat he adds one more distinguished name to that list of freedmen, who\r\nwere celebrated in the annals of literature. Although, in the preface to\r\nhis work, he modestly terms himself only a translator of Æsop,\r\n\r\n                Æsopus auctor quam materiam repperit\r\n                Hanc ego polivi versibus senariis,[1012]\r\n\r\nstill, for many of his fables, he deserves the credit of originality.\r\nProbably he enlarged and extended his original plan; for he afterwards\r\nspeaks of simply adopting the style and not the matter of the Æsopean\r\nfable.[1013]\r\n\r\nHe does not appear to have gained much fame or popularity; for he is\r\nonly twice mentioned by ancient authorities, namely, by Martial[1014]\r\nand Seneca.[1015] The latter, writing to Polybius, a favourite freedman\r\nof Claudius, encourages him to enter upon the field which Phædrus\r\nalready occupied, asserting that fables in the style of Æsop constituted\r\na work hitherto unattempted by Roman genius (_intentatum Romanis\r\ningeniis opus_.) Either, therefore, the fables of Phædrus were little\r\nknown and appreciated, or Seneca purposely concealed from the Emperor’s\r\nfavourite the fact of their existence, in order to flatter him with the\r\nhopes of his thus becoming the first Roman writer in his style. The\r\npersecution to which literary men were subject under the worst Emperors,\r\nof which Phædrus hints obscurely that he was a victim[1016]—the perils\r\nto which he would have been exposed by strictures upon persons in power,\r\nwhich, concealed under the veil of fiction, appear now dark and\r\nenigmatical, but which might have spoken plainly to the consciences of\r\nthe actors themselves—probably rendered it a wise precaution to conceal\r\nhis works during his lifetime; hence they would be little known, except\r\nto a chosen few, and the few copies made of them would account for the\r\nrarity of the extant manuscripts.\r\n\r\nOwing to the deficiency of ancient testimony, the genuineness of the\r\nFables has been disputed; but the purity of style, and the natural\r\nallusions to contemporary events render it almost certain that they\r\nbelong to the age in which they were supposed to have been written. No\r\none but a contemporary could have written the fable commencing—\r\n\r\n               Narrabo memoria quod factum est mea.[1017]\r\n\r\nThe prologue to the third book evidently speaks of the author’s own\r\ncalamities; and the way in which the name of Sejanus is connected with\r\nthe event, hints, although obscurely, that that prime minister of\r\ntyranny was the author of his sufferings. It is scarcely probable that\r\nhe would have ventured to attack Sejanus during his lifetime. It may,\r\ntherefore, be assumed that Phædrus lived beyond the eighteenth year of\r\nthe reign of Tiberius, in which year Sejanus died.\r\n\r\nThe original manuscript followed in the early editions of Phædrus was\r\ndiscovered in the tenth century: it contained ninety-seven fables,\r\ndivided into five books. But N. Perotto, an archbishop of Manfredonia,\r\nin the fifteenth century, published a miscellaneous collection of Latin\r\nfables, and amongst them were thirty-two new fables attributed to\r\nPhædrus, which were not found in the older editions. These were at first\r\nsupposed to have been written by Perotto himself; but the manifest\r\ninferiority of some poems known to be the work of the archbishop, and\r\nthe Augustan purity of style which marks the newly-discovered fables,\r\nleave little doubt of their genuineness. Consequently, they were\r\npublished by Angelo Mai as supplementary to those which had already\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the times in which he lived suggested the moral and\r\nprudential lessons which his fables inculcated. The bane of Rome, under\r\nthe empire, was the public informer (_delator_,) as the sycophant had\r\nbeen the pest of Athens. Life and conduct, private as well as public,\r\nwere exposed to a complete system of espionage: no one was safe from\r\nthis formidable inquisition; a man’s familiar associate might be in\r\nsecret his bitterest enemy. But the principal victims were the rich:\r\nthey were marked out for destruction, in order that the confiscation of\r\ntheir property might glut the avarice of the Emperor and the informers.\r\nFor this reason, Phædrus himself professes always to have seen the peril\r\nof acquiring wealth—\r\n\r\n                  Periculosum semper reputavi lucrum.\r\n\r\nAnd we cannot be surprised that the danger of riches, and the\r\ncomparative safety of obscurity and poverty, should sometimes form the\r\nmoral of his fables.\r\n\r\nThat of the Mules and the Thieves, which is entirely his own, teaches\r\nthis lesson:—\r\n\r\n              Muli gravati sarcinis ibant duo;\r\n              Unus ferebat fiscos cum pecuniâ,\r\n              Alter tumentes multo saccos hordeo.\r\n              Ille, onere dives, celsâ cervice eminet,\r\n              Clarumque collo jactat tintinnabulum;\r\n              Comes quieto sequitur et placido gradu.\r\n              Subito latrones ex insidiis advolant,\r\n              Interque cædem ferro mulum sauciant,\r\n              Diripiunt nummos, negligunt vile hordeum.\r\n              Spoliatus igitur cum casus fleret suos,\r\n              Equidem, inquit alter, me contemptum gaudeo,\r\n              Nam nihil amisi nec sum læsus vulnere.\r\n              Hoc argumento tuta est hominum tenuitas;\r\n              Magnæ periclo sunt opes obnoxiæ.[1018]\r\n\r\n“Two mules, laden with heavy burdens, were journeying together: one\r\ncarried bags of money; the other, sacks filled with barley. The former,\r\nproud of his rich load, carried his head high, and made the bell on his\r\nneck sound merrily; his companion followed with quiet and gentle paces.\r\nOn a sudden, some thieves rush from an ambuscade, wound the\r\ntreasure-mule, strip him of his money-bags, but leave untouched the\r\nworthless barley. When, therefore, the sufferer bewailed his sad\r\ncase—‘For my part,’ replied his companion, ‘I rejoice that I was treated\r\nwith contempt; for I have no wounds, and have lost nothing.’ The subject\r\nof this fable proves that poverty is safe, whilst great wealth is\r\nexposed to peril.”\r\n\r\nThe fable of the Man and the Ass teaches a salutary lesson to another\r\nclass of wealthy men, namely, those favourites of the emperor and his\r\ncreatures, who owed their wealth to plunder and confiscation. Every\r\nday’s experience proved that those who battened on the spoils of the\r\noppressed one day, became themselves the victims of the same tyrannical\r\nsystem the next. Like that of the prime minister, Sejanus himself, the\r\nsun of their prosperity was destined to set, and their ill-gotten spoil\r\nto enrich others as unworthy as themselves. Those fortunes were indeed\r\nbuilt upon a rotten foundation, which the same system had power to raise\r\nup and to overthrow:—\r\n\r\n             Quidam immolasset verrem quum sancto Herculi,\r\n             Cui pro salute votum debebat sua,\r\n             Asello jussit reliquias poni hordei.\r\n             Quas aspernatus ille sic locutus est:\r\n             Tuum libenter prorsus appeterem cibum\r\n             Nisi, qui nutritus illo est, jugulatus foret.\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n             Majorem turbam punitorum reperies;\r\n             Paucis temeritas est bono, multis malo.[1019]\r\n\r\n“A man who had sacrificed a boar to Hercules, which he had vowed as a\r\nthank-offering for his recovery from sickness, ordered the remains of\r\nthe barley to be given to his ass. The ass rejected it with scorn, and\r\nsaid, ‘I would gladly eat of the food you give me, had not he who was\r\nfattened on it had his throat cut.’\r\n\r\n“You will find that the majority of those who grow rich by violence and\r\nrapine are punished; audacity succeeds with few, but ruins many.”\r\n\r\nThe continued succession of tyrannical emperors must have taught their\r\noppressed subjects that they had nothing to hope for from a change of\r\nthose who wore the purple. This truth is imbodied in the fable of the\r\nold Peasant and his Ass:——\r\n\r\n             In principatu commutando civium\r\n             Nil, præter domini nomen, mutant pauperes.\r\n             Id esse verum parva hæc fabula indicat.\r\n             Asellum in prato timidus pascebat senex.\r\n             Is, hostium clamore subito territus,\r\n             Suadebat asino fugere, ne possent capi.\r\n             At ille lentus; quæso, num binas mihi\r\n             Clitellas impositurum victorem putas?\r\n             Senex negavit. Ergo quid refert mea\r\n             Cui serviam, clitellas dum portem meas?[1020]\r\n\r\n“In a change of princes the poor change nothing but the name of their\r\nmaster. The truth of this is shown by the following little fable. A\r\ntimid old man was feeding his ass in a meadow. Alarmed by the shouts of\r\nan advancing enemy he urged the ass to fly for fear they should be taken\r\nprisoners. But the ass loitered, and said, ‘Pray, do you think that the\r\nconqueror will put two pack-saddles on my back?’ ‘No,’ replied the old\r\nman. ‘What, then, does it matter to me in whose service I am, so long as\r\nI have to carry my load?’”\r\n\r\nThe well known fable of the Wolf and the Lamb (i. 1) illustrates the\r\nunscrupulousness of the informers; and that of the Wolf and the\r\nHouse-dog (iii. 7) teaches how preferable is liberty, even under the\r\ngreatest privations, to luxury and comfort purchased by submission to\r\nthe caprices of a master.\r\n\r\nOf such a kind were the moral and political lessons which Phædrus\r\nenforced in the attractive garb of fables. They were of a general\r\ncharacter, suggested by the evils of the times in which he lived.\r\n\r\nAnother class were suggested by historical events: they were\r\nnevertheless severe satirical strictures on individuals. Two may be\r\npointed out as examples which are evidently directed against Tiberius\r\nand Sejanus. These are—The Frogs demanding a King, (i. 2;) and the Frogs\r\nand the Sun, (i. 6.) Neither of the fables are original; they are\r\napposite applications of two by Æsop.\r\n\r\nThe Romans,[1021] like the frogs in the first of these fables, had\r\nexchanged their liberty for the slavery of the empire. In Tiberius, now\r\nan imbecile dotard, wholly given up to sensual indulgence in his retreat\r\nat Capreæ, they had a perfect King Log. He was utterly careless of the\r\nsufferings of his subjects and the administration of his kingdom.\r\n\r\nTo his odious minister, Sejanus, he intrusted the toils of government,\r\nto which his own indolence indisposed him. All tyranny and cruelty were\r\nascribed to the ministers; whilst the effeminate debauchery of the\r\nEmperor rendered him, even in that demoralized age, an object of\r\ncontempt and insult rather than of abhorrence and fear. L. Sejanus, a\r\nkinsman of Ælius,[1022] employed bald-headed persons, and children with\r\ntheir heads shaved, in the procession of the Floral games, in order to\r\nhold up to scorn and derision the bald-headed Emperor, and he dared not\r\ntake notice of the insult. The infamous Fulcinius Trio in his last will\r\ndeclared that Tiberius had become childish in his old age, and that his\r\ncontinued retirement was nothing else but exile.[1023] Pacuvianus was\r\nthe author of pasquinades against the Emperor. In the same way Phædrus\r\ndescribes the frogs as treating “King Log” with scorn, and as defiling\r\nhim in the most offensive manner.\r\n\r\nBut after the death of Sejanus a change took place in the Emperor’s\r\nconduct, though not in his character. He left Capreæ for a time, and\r\ntook up his abode in the Vatican, close to the very walls of Rome. He\r\nnow gave vent to his savage disposition, and displayed the temper of the\r\nwater-snake in the fable. His natural cruelty was equalled by his\r\nactivity. “His sharp tooth seized his unresisting victims one after the\r\nother: in vain they fly from death; fear prevents them from uttering a\r\nword in defence or expostulation.” No longer a vast expanse of sea and\r\nland intervened between the tyrant and his victims. There was nothing to\r\ndelay the pompous and verbose missives of his bloody purposes: his\r\nrescripts could reach the consuls the same day, or at least after the\r\ninterval of a night: he could behold, as it were, with his own eyes, the\r\nreeking hands of the executioners, and the waves of blood which deluged\r\nevery dwelling.[1024] Vengeance not only fell on the guilty Sejanus and\r\nhis unoffending family, the vilest and the noblest blood of Rome alike\r\nflowed at the tyrant’s command. The fable of the Frogs and the Sun was a\r\ncovert attack upon the ambitious designs of Sejanus. It is sufficiently\r\nshort to be quoted:\r\n\r\n             Uxorem quandam Sol quum vellet ducere,\r\n             Clamorem Ranæ sustulere ad sidera.\r\n             Convicio permotus, quærit Jupiter\r\n             Causam querelæ. Quædam tum stagni incola,\r\n             Nunc, inquit, omnes unus exurit lacus\r\n             Cogitque miseras arida sede emori;\r\n             Quidnam futurum est, si creârit liberos?[1025]\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time the Sun determined to marry; and the Frogs raised a\r\ncry of alarm to Heaven. Jupiter, moved by their complaints, asked the\r\ncause of them. One of the denizens of the pond answered:—‘Now the Sun by\r\nhimself dries up all the lakes, and causes us to die a miserable death\r\nin our parched-up dwellings. What then will become of us if he has\r\nchildren?’”\r\n\r\nNow let us examine the application. The fawning yet ambitious Sejanus\r\nhad always aspired to ally himself with the imperial family. The first\r\nattempt which he made to accomplish his design was procuring the\r\nbetrothal of his daughter to Drusus, the son of Claudius, afterwards\r\nemperor. This prince died young, and consequently the marriage never\r\ntook place;[1026] but this first opened the eyes of the Romans to the\r\naudacious projects of the favourite. Later in his career,[1027] he, by a\r\nsimilar step, endeavoured to pave his way to the imperial purple. He\r\nseduced Livilla, the sister of the amiable Germanicus, poisoned her\r\nhusband, divorced his own wife, and asked the sanction of Tiberius to\r\nhis marriage with the widow of the murdered man. The emperor, with his\r\nusual finesse and dissimulation, refused. The demand awoke the\r\nsuspicions of the court, and was a commencement of that coolness between\r\nSejanus and his patron which eventually ended in the fall of the latter.\r\nThe influence of Sejanus alone was sufficiently baneful; what would it\r\nbe if multiplied by a race of princes descended from him? The mere\r\nprobability of such an event naturally filled Rome with alarm and\r\nconsternation; and this Phædrus endeavoured to encourage by a fable,\r\nwhich, if it had not some such object as this, would scarcely be\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\nThe quotations which have been given from the fables of Phædrus are\r\nsufficient, as examples of his ingenuity in imitation and adaptation, as\r\nwell as of his original genius, whenever he trusts to his powers of\r\ninvention. Some of his pieces, although, like the rest, they are\r\nentitled fables, are, in fact, narratives of real events, and show that\r\nhe possessed a charming talent for telling anecdotes, besides skill as a\r\nfabulist in the proper sense of the term. His style has great merits: it\r\ncombines the simple neatness and graceful elegance of the golden age\r\nwith the vigour and terseness of the silver one. Phædrus has the\r\nfacility of Ovid, and the brevity of Tacitus. Thus standing in the epoch\r\nbetween two literary periods, he, as far as the humble nature of his\r\nwalk admits, unites the excellencies of both. Between the age of Horace\r\nand Juvenal, Cicero and Tacitus, there was a gap, and a long one, not\r\nless than half a century: it was a period in which Roman genius was\r\nslumbering. Phædrus proves that that sleep was not the sleep of death.\r\nTacitus has partially accounted for this cold and dark interval. He\r\ntells us[1028]—“that although the affairs of the ancient Roman republic,\r\nwhether in prosperity or in adversity, were related by illustrious\r\nwriters—and even the times of Augustus were not deficient in historians\r\nof talent and genius—nevertheless the gradual growth of a spirit of\r\nadulation deterred all who were qualified for the task from attempting\r\nit. Fear, during the lifetime of Tiberius, Caius, Claudius, and Nero,\r\nand hatred, still fresh after their deaths, rendered all accounts of\r\ntheir reigns false.”\r\n\r\nIt was thus, according to him, fear and hatred, and a spirit of\r\nflattery, that silenced the voice of history. Doubtless what he says of\r\nhistory applies with equal force to poetry, and oratory likewise. The\r\nsame cause which crushed political liberty rendered the truthfulness of\r\nthe historian fraught with danger, and all poetry, except it spoke the\r\nlanguage of adulation, treason; a crime which was no longer one against\r\nthe majesty of the people, but was transferred to the person of the\r\nemperor. The very term παρρησια (boldness of speech) was a word, the\r\nutterance of which was as perilous as to speak of liberty.[1029] The\r\ndanger had scarcely passed away when Juvenal, notwithstanding his\r\nfearless spirit, wrote:—\r\n\r\n                      Unde illa priorum\r\n     Scribendi quodcunque animo flagrante liberet,\r\n     Simplicitas, cujus non audeo dicere nomen.\r\n                                                    _Juv._ i. 153.\r\n\r\n  Where the plain times, the simple, when our sires\r\n  Enjoyed a freedom which I dare not name,\r\n  And gave the public sin to public shame,\r\n  Heedless who smiled or frowned.\r\n                                                           _Gifford._\r\n\r\nBut there was a negative as well as a positive cause, the withdrawal of\r\npatronage. Literature, in order to flourish, requires the genial\r\nsunshine of human sympathy: it needs either the patronage of the great\r\nor the favour of the people. In Greece it enjoyed the latter in the\r\nhighest possible degree; in Rome, from the time of the Scipios to that\r\nof Augustus, it was fostered by the former. Immediately after his death\r\npatronage was withdrawn, and there was not public support to supply its\r\nplace. Tiberius was first a soldier; then a dark and reserved\r\npolitician; lastly, a blood-thirsty and superstitious sensualist. The\r\nenjoyments of Gaius Caligula were the extravagancies of a madman,\r\nalthough he was responsible for his moral insanity, because he had, by\r\nvicious indulgence, been the destroyer of his moral principle; and not\r\nonly did he not encourage literature, but he even hated Homer and\r\nVirgil. Lastly, the stupid and dozing Claudius wrote books[1030] as\r\nstupid as himself, and was at once the butt and tool of his courtiers.\r\nIt was not, therefore, until the reign of Nero that literature revived;\r\nfor, though the bloodiest of tyrants, he had an ambition to excel in\r\nrefinement, and had a taste for art and poetry.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of his fables, Phædrus displays observation and\r\ningenuity. Nothing escapes his watchful eye which can be turned to\r\naccount in his little poems. A rude sketch in charcoal on the wall of a\r\nlow tavern[1031] suggested to him the idea of the Battle between the\r\nRats and the Weasels. His animals are grouped, and put in attitudes,\r\njust as a painter would arrange them. His accurate eye has noted and\r\nregistered the habits of the brute creation, and he has adapted them to\r\nthe delivery of noble and wise sentiments with the utmost ingenuity. But\r\nthere his genius stops. He is deficient in imagination. He makes his\r\nanimals the vehicles of his wisdom; but he does not throw himself into\r\nthem, or identify himself with them. The true poet is lost in his\r\ncharacters: carried away by the enthusiasm of an inspired imagination,\r\nhis spirit is transfused into his heroes;—you forget his existence. The\r\ncharacters of Phædrus look and act like animals, but talk like human\r\nbeings: the moralist and the philosopher can always be detected speaking\r\nunder their mask and in their disguise.\r\n\r\nIn this consists the great superiority of Æsop to his Roman imitator.\r\nHis brutes are a superior race, but they are still brutes. The reader\r\ncould almost fancy that the fabulist had lived amongst them as one of\r\nthemselves—had adopted their modes of life, and had conversed with them\r\nin their own language. In Phædrus we have human sentiments translated\r\ninto the language of beasts—in Æsop we have beasts giving utterance to\r\nsuch sentiments as would be naturally theirs, if they were placed in the\r\nposition of men. Skilful adaptation and happy delineation are the\r\ntriumphs of ingenuity and observation: the creative power is that of the\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nThe style of Phædrus, notwithstanding a few provincialisms,[1032] is\r\npure and classical. He does not often indulge in the use of metaphors,\r\nbut the few which are met with are striking and appropriate. He is not\r\nentirely free from some of that far-fetched affectation which\r\ncharacterizes the decline of Roman literature. But his fault is\r\nexaggerated conciseness, and the concentration of many ideas within a\r\nbrief space, rather than the rhetorical ornament which now began to be\r\nadmired and popular. His endeavour after brevity led him to use abstract\r\nsubstantives far more profusely than is consistent with the practice of\r\nthe best classical writers. These faults, however, do not interfere with\r\nthat clearness and simplicity, which, quite as much as the subjects,\r\nhave rendered the fables of Phædrus a popular book for the young\r\nstudent, and please even those who have the opportunity of comparing his\r\niambics with the liveliness of Gay, the politeness of Florian, the\r\nphilosophy of Lessing, the sweetness of Cowper, and the unequalled\r\nversatility of La Fontaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n DRAMATIC LITERATURE IN THE AUGUSTAN AGE—REVIVAL UNDER NERO—DEFECTS OF\r\n     THE TRAGEDIES ATTRIBUTED TO SENECA—INTERNAL EVIDENCE OF THEIR\r\nAUTHORSHIP—SENECA THE PHILOSOPHER A STOIC—INCONSISTENT AND UNSTABLE—THE\r\n SENTIMENTS OF HIS PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS FOUND IN HIS TRAGEDIES—PARALLEL\r\n            PASSAGES COMPARED—FRENCH SCHOOL OF TRAGIC POETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Roman tragedy in its earliest period, so far as the fragments of it\r\nwhich remain allow a judgment to be formed, an account has already been\r\ngiven; and if circumstances forbade it to flourish then, still less can\r\nit be expected that the boldness and independence of Greek tragedy would\r\nbe found under the empire.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there were not wanting some imitators of Greece in this\r\nnoblest branch of Greek poetry, however unsuitable it was to the genius\r\nof the Roman people, and unlikely to be appreciated by them.\r\n\r\nBut their productions were rather literary than dramatic; they were\r\nintended to be read, not acted. They were poems composed in a dramatic\r\nform, because Athens had set the example of that form to her devoted\r\nimitators. Although, therefore, they contain noble philosophical\r\nsentiments, lively descriptions, vigorous conceptions and delineations\r\nof character, and passages full of tenderness and pathos, they are\r\ndeficient in dramatic effect, and positively offend against those laws\r\nof good taste, which, not arbitrarily assumed, but founded on the\r\nprinciples of the human mind, regulated the Athenian stage.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, in the Augustan age, a few writers attained some\r\nexcellence in tragedy, at least in the opinion of ancient critics.\r\nBesides Ovid and Varius, whose tragedies have been already mentioned,\r\nAsinius Pollio acquired a high reputation as a tragic poet, and\r\nVirgil[1033] declares that he is the only one worthy of being compared\r\nwith Sophocles:—\r\n\r\n               Sola Sophocleo tua carmina digna cothurno.\r\n\r\nOn the revival of letters under that professor of a love of\r\npoetry,[1034] the tyrant Nero, dramatic literature reappeared, and\r\nperfect specimens are extant in the ten tragedies attributed to Seneca.\r\nVarious and opposite opinions have been entertained respecting their\r\nmerits; but there can be no doubt that the genius of the author never\r\ncan grasp in their wholeness the characters which he attempts to copy;\r\nthey are distorted images of the Greek originals; the awful and shadowy\r\ngrandeur of the god-like heroes of Æschylus stand forth in corporeal\r\nvastness, and appear childish and unnatural, like the giants of a\r\nstory-book. The marvels of Greek tragedy and Greek mythology, though\r\nmerely the unreal conceptions of the imagination, do not appear\r\nexaggerated, because the connexion between the theory and the result,\r\nthe causes and the effects, is so skilfully maintained; but in these\r\nRoman tragedies the legends of Greece appear extravagant and absurd:\r\nthey are as unreal, and therefore seem as affected, as the classical\r\ngarb in which English poetry was arrayed in the age of Anne. The Greeks\r\nbelieved in the gods and heroes whose agency and exploits constituted\r\nthe machinery of tragedy—the Romans did not; and thus we cannot\r\nsympathize with them, because we see that they are insincere. The style,\r\nmoreover, of the tragedies, which bear the name of Seneca, is spoiled by\r\nthat inflated language and redundancy of ornament, the constant effect\r\nof which is, as Aristotle observes, frigidity. They bear the visible\r\nmarks of an age in which genius had given place to an artificial and\r\nscholastic rhetoric; and the author seems to have been striving not for\r\ntragic pathos so much as brilliant declamation. In the female\r\ncharacters, especially, the Roman tragic poet fails; for, although he\r\ncan understand heroism, he is unable to accomplish that most difficult\r\nof all tasks, the combining it with feminine delicacy. Perhaps the best\r\nand noblest of his country-women did not furnish him with such ideals.\r\nThe Roman matron was the counterpart of her warlike lord. The Lucretias,\r\nPorcias, Cornelias, Arrias, though devoted and affectionate, were of\r\nsterner mould than Antigone and Deianira.\r\n\r\nThe tragedies which bear the name of Seneca have been attributed to L.\r\nAnnæus Seneca, the philosopher, as early as the time of\r\nQuintilian,[1035] who quotes as Seneca’s a verse from the Medea. The\r\nimprobability of this being the case is also diminished by the fact that\r\nboth Tacitus[1036] and Pliny the younger[1037] speak of him as a poet.\r\nNevertheless, their authorship has been considered a very doubtful\r\nquestion. A passage in an epigram of Martial, in which he speaks of\r\nCordova as the birthplace of two Senecas and one Lucan—\r\n\r\n                   Duosque Senecas unicumque Lucanum\r\n                     Facunda loquitur Corduba[1038]—\r\n\r\nhas been interpreted as implying that Seneca the philosopher was a\r\ndifferent person from Seneca the tragedian. There can, however, be\r\nscarcely any doubt that he was speaking of M. Annæus Seneca the\r\nrhetorician, and his son Lucius the philosopher. Sidonius\r\nApollinaris,[1039] the son-in-law of the Emperor Flavius Avitus, and\r\nBishop of Clermont,[1040] in the last years of the Roman empire,\r\nunhesitatingly draws a distinction between them. He enumerates three\r\nmembers of the Cordovan family:—\r\n\r\n     Quorum unus colit hispidum Platonem,\r\n     Incassumque suum monet Neronem,\r\n     Orchestram quatit alter Euripidis\r\n     Pictum fæcibus Æschylum sequutus,\r\n     Aut plaustris solitum sonare Thespim\r\n     Pugnam tertius ille Gallicanam\r\n     Dixit Cæsaris.\r\n                                                  _Carm._ ix. 231.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding the celebrity which Sidonius enjoyed as a poet at\r\nthe imperial court, his opinion is of no authority when weighed against\r\nthe internal evidence derived from the tragedies themselves. This\r\nrenders it almost morally certain, that they are the work of no other\r\nwriter than Seneca the philosopher.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Romans, as being imitators of the Greeks, and not original\r\nthinkers, were eclectics in philosophy, their favourite doctrines were\r\nthose of the Stoics. They suited the rigid sternness of their character:\r\nthey imbodied that spirit of self-devotion and self-denial with which\r\nthe Roman patriot, in the old times of simple republican virtue, threw\r\nhimself into his public duties; and Seneca, with all his faults, was a\r\nreal Roman: with all his finesse and artful policy, he retained, in the\r\nmidst of a debased age and a profligate court, a large portion of the\r\nold Roman character. In life and in death his was a true specimen of the\r\nStoic creed.\r\n\r\nStill he was by no means a consistent man: his theory was perfect, but\r\nhis practice often fell short of it. The lessons of morality contained\r\nin his philosophical works are excellent, and persuasively enforced, and\r\nwear an appearance of honesty and sincerity; but, nevertheless, in his\r\nphilosophy, as well as in his life, we can discover that his moral\r\nprinciples were unstable and wavering. These two features can be traced\r\nin his tragedies: they abound in philosophical dogmas and moral\r\nsentiments, and they display the same Stoicism mingled with occasional\r\nhabits of inconsistency. Suicide is painted in the most attractive\r\ncolours: death is met not only with courage, but with the same\r\nindifference with which Seneca himself, together with other victims of\r\nimperial tyranny, met it in his own day. It is not welcomed, as in the\r\nGreek tragedians, as a relief from the burden of earthly sorrows; but\r\nthere is a manifest departure from the Greek model: the natural beauty\r\nof that model is violated, and the features of the original character\r\nsacrificed to Stoical coldness and want of feeling.\r\n\r\nBut not only are these tragedies filled with philosophical reflections;\r\neven the sentiments enunciated in the acknowledged works of Seneca, in\r\nhis Essays and Epistles, are transferred to them, and the peculiar turns\r\nof expression used by the philosopher are repeated by the poet. A\r\nbrilliant French author[1041] has ingeniously brought together and\r\ncompared parallel passages, which illustrate this similarity of\r\nsentiment and style. A few of these are sufficient as examples. Two in\r\nthe “Phœnissæ,” in which Œdipus insists on “the liberty of dying,”\r\nimbody the same doctrine as two others, one in the epistles to Lucilius,\r\nthe other in the treatise on Providence.\r\n\r\n  He (says Œdipus) who compels one who is unwilling to die does the same\r\n  as he who hinders one who is eager for death; nay, I consider the\r\n  latter treats me the worse of the two. I had rather that death were\r\n  forced upon me than that the privilege of dying should be torn from\r\n  me.\r\n\r\n           Qui cogit mori\r\n         Nolentem, in æquo est, quique properantem impedit.\r\n         Nec tamen in æquo est; alterum gravius reor,\r\n         Malo imperari quam eripi mortem mihi.\r\n                                                     _Phœnis._ 98.\r\n\r\nAnd again the same favourite sentiment appears:—\r\n\r\n  I cannot be prevented from dying; of what availeth all that care of\r\n  thine? Death is everywhere. Most wisely has God provided for this.\r\n  There is no one who cannot rob a man of life, but no one can rob him\r\n  of death; to this a thousand roads are open.\r\n\r\n                         Morte prohiberi haud queo.\r\n     Quid ista tandem cura proficit tua?\r\n     Ubique mors est. Optime hoc _cavit_ Deus.\r\n     Eripere vitam nemo non homini potest;\r\n     _At nemo mortem_; mille ad hanc aditus _patent_.\r\n                                                    _Phœnis._ 146.\r\n\r\nWith these are compared the following sentences of the philosopher, in\r\nwhich not only the doctrines, but also the language in which they are\r\nexpressed, are so strikingly parallel as scarcely to admit of a doubt\r\nthat the authors are identical:—\r\n\r\n  To live under compulsion is an evil; but there is no compulsion to\r\n  live under compulsion. Many roads to liberty lie open on all sides,\r\n  short and easy. Let us thank God that no one can be retained in life.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, Divine Providence is represented as declaring to mankind:—\r\n\r\n  Before all things I have provided that no one should detain you\r\n  against your will—an exit is open to you.\r\n\r\n  Malum est in necessitate vivere, sed in necessitate vivere necessitas\r\n  nulla est. _Patent_ undique ad libertatem _viæ multæ_, breves,\r\n  faciles. Agamus Deo gratias, quod nemo in vitâ teneri potest.—Ep. xii.\r\n\r\n     Ante omnia _cavi_, ne quis vos teneret invitos, patet exitus.\r\n                                               _De Provident._ vi.\r\n\r\nHow exactly in accordance with these sentiments, whether expressed in\r\npoetry or prose, is the closing scene of Seneca’s life; the almost\r\nbusiness-like way in which he entered upon the road which was appointed\r\nto lead him from the dominion of necessity to the enjoyment of\r\nliberty—the imperturbable coolness with which he could contemplate the\r\ndeath of his wife, whom he loved with the greatest affection![1042] How\r\ncalculated, moreover, were they to engage the sympathies of his\r\ncontemporaries! It was an age in which, amidst its various corruptions,\r\nthe only virtue which survived was the knowing how to meet death with a\r\ncourageous spirit, in which many of the best and the noblest willingly\r\ndied by their own hands at the imperial mandate, in order to save their\r\nname from infamy, and the inheritance of their children from\r\nconfiscation.\r\n\r\nAgain, an awful belief in destiny, and the hopeless, yet patient,\r\nstruggle of a great and good man against this all-ruling power, is the\r\nmainspring of Greek tragedy. This is not transferred into the imitations\r\nof the Romans. Its place is supplied by the stern fatalism of the\r\nStoics. The principle of destiny entertained by the Greek poets is a\r\nmythological, even a religious one: it is the irresistible will of God.\r\nGod is at the commencement of the chain of causes and effects by which\r\nthe event is brought about which God has ordained; his inspired prophets\r\nhave power to foretell, and mortals cannot resist or avoid. It is rather\r\npredestination than destiny. The doctrine implies an intelligent agent,\r\nnot a mere abstract principle.\r\n\r\nThe fatalism of the Stoics, on the other hand, is the doctrine of\r\npractical necessity. It ignores the almighty power of the Supreme Being,\r\nalthough it does not deny his existence. It strips him of his attributes\r\nas the moral Governor of the universe. These doctrines are found both in\r\nthe philosopher and tragic poet. Translate the subjoined prose passage\r\ninto the conventional language of poetry, adopt as a mere matter of\r\nembellishment the fables of Greek mythology, personify the Stoical\r\nprinciple of necessity by the Greek Fates, and it becomes the Chorus in\r\nthe Latin tragedy Œdipus. Both these passages are quoted by Nisard:—\r\n\r\n  _Nihil cogor nihil patior invitus_; nec servio Deo, sed assentior; eo\r\n  quidem magis, quod scio _omnia certa_ et in æternum dicta lege\r\n  decurrere. _Fata nos ducunt_, et quantum cuique restat, _prima\r\n  nascentium hora disposuit. Causa pendet ex causa_; privata ac publica\r\n  _longus ordo_ rerum trahit. Ideo fortiter omne ferendum est; quia non,\r\n  ut putamus, incidunt cuncta, sed veniunt. Olim constitutum est quid\r\n  gaudeas, quid fleas; et quamvis magna videatur varietate singulorum\r\n  vita distingui, summa in unum venit; accepimus peritura perituri.\r\n\r\n                                                         _De Provid._ v.\r\n\r\n  I am neither compelled to do or to suffer anything against my will. I\r\n  am not a slave to God, but I bow to his will. The more so because I\r\n  know that all things are fixed and proceed according to an everlasting\r\n  law. Destiny is our guide, and the hour of our birth has disposed all\r\n  the remainder of our lives. Each cause depends upon a preceding one; a\r\n  long chain of circumstances links together all things, both public and\r\n  private. Therefore we must bear all things with fortitude, since all\r\n  things _come to pass_, and do not, as we suppose, _happen_. Our joys\r\n  or sorrows have been determined long ago; and although a great variety\r\n  of items distinguishes the lives of individuals, the sum total is the\r\n  same. Perishable creatures ourselves, that which we have received is\r\n  perishable likewise.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the above with the following passage exhibits a\r\nsimilarity which could only have proceeded from the same mind and the\r\nsame pen; for it is to be remembered, that though the Romans were\r\nimitators of the Greeks, they did not copy one another; and throughout\r\nthe whole field of Roman literature no example could be found of a poet\r\ntransferring to his works the exact sentiments, tone of thought, and\r\nturn of expression of another Latin author:—\r\n\r\n     _Fatis agimur, cedite fatis_:\r\n     Non sollicitæ possunt curæ\r\n     Mutare rati stamina fusi.\r\n     _Quicquid patimur_, mortale genus,\r\n     _Quicquid facimus_, venit ex alto;\r\n     Servatque suæ decreta colus\r\n     Lachesis, dura revoluta manu.\r\n     _Omnia certo tramite_ vadunt\r\n     _Primusque dies dedit extremum_.\r\n     Non illa Deo vertisse licet\r\n     _Quæ nexa suis currunt causis_.\r\n     It cuique ratus, prece non ulla\r\n     Mobilis, _ordo_.\r\n                                                      _Œdip._ 980.\r\n\r\n  We are led by destiny—yield then to its power. Anxious care cannot\r\n  change the thread spun by the distaff of the Fates. Whatever we\r\n  mortals do or suffer comes from on high; and Lachesis observes the\r\n  decrees of the wheel which revolves beneath her pitiless hand. All\r\n  things proceed in a fixed path, and the first day of life has\r\n  determined the last. God has not power to change the chain of causes\r\n  and effects. Each has its fixed order, which no prayers can alter.\r\n\r\nEven the philosophical inconsistencies[1043] traceable in the prose\r\ntreatises are repeated in the tragedies. In one letter[1044] he affirms\r\nhis belief that the soul of Scipio Africanus has ascended into heaven as\r\na reward of his virtue and piety; in another[1045] he asserts the gloomy\r\ndoctrine that death is annihilation: “Mors est non esse.” In like manner\r\nin the “Troades” the Chorus declares that the happy Priam wanders\r\namongst pious souls in the “safe Elysian shades;”[1046] and yet, with an\r\ninconsistency which the Letters of the philosopher alone account for,\r\nanother passage in the same tragedy declares that the spirit vanishes\r\nlike smoke, that after death is nothingness, and death itself is\r\nnothing.[1047]\r\n\r\nOn such internal evidence as this rests the probability, almost\r\namounting to certainty, that Seneca the philosopher, and the author of\r\nthe ten tragedies, are one and the same.[1048]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their false rhetorical taste, and the absence of all\r\nideal and creative genius, the tragedies of Seneca found many admirers\r\nand imitators in modern times. The French school of tragic poets took\r\nthem for their model: Corneille evidently considered them the ideal of\r\ntragedy, and Racine servilely imitated them. Their philosophy captivated\r\nan age which thought that nothing was so sublime as heathen philosophy;\r\nand yet that same age derived its notions of ancient philosophy from the\r\nRomans instead of from the original Greek sources; and its poetical\r\ntaste, as far as it was classical, was formed on a study of Roman\r\ndramatic literature, before the excellence of the Attic drama was\r\nsufficiently known to be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n   BIOGRAPHY OF PERSIUS—HIS SCHOOLBOY DAYS—HIS FRIENDS—HIS PURITY AND\r\n MODESTY—HIS DEFECTS AS A SATIRIST—SUBJECTS OF HIS SATIRES—OBSCURITY OF\r\nHIS STYLE—COMPARED WITH HORACE—BIOGRAPHY OF JUVENAL—CORRUPTION OF ROMAN\r\nMORALS—CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS OF THE SATIRES—THEIR HISTORICAL VALUE—STYLE\r\n             OF JUVENAL—HE WAS THE LAST OF ROMAN SATIRISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 AULUS PERSIUS FLACCUS (BORN A. D. 34.)\r\n\r\nRoman satire subsequently to Horace is represented by Aulus Persius\r\nFlaccus and Decimus Junius Juvenalis. Persius was a member of an\r\nequestrian family, and was born, according to the Eusebian Chronicle,\r\nA. D. 34, at Volaterræ in Etruria. He was related to the best families\r\nin Italy, and numbered amongst his kindred Arria, the noble-minded wife\r\nof Pætus. His father died when he was six years old, and his mother,\r\nFulvia Sisenna, married a second time a Roman knight named Fusius. In a\r\nfew years she was again a widow. Persius received his elementary\r\neducation at his native town; but at twelve years of age he was brought\r\nto Rome, and went through the usual course of grammar and rhetoric,\r\nunder Remmius Palæmon[1049] and Virginius Flavus.[1050] The former of\r\nthese was, like so many men of letters, a freedman, and the son of a\r\nslave. He was, according to Suetonius,[1051] a man of profligate morals,\r\nbut gifted with great fluency of speech, and a prodigious memory. He was\r\nrather a versifier than a poet, and, like so many modern Italians,\r\npossessed the talent of improvising. He was prosperous as a\r\nschoolmaster, considering the very small pittance which the members of\r\nthat profession usually earned, for his school brought him in forty\r\nsestertia per annum (about 325_l._[1052]) Virginius Flavus is only known\r\nas the author of a treatise on Rhetoric.\r\n\r\nPersius himself gives[1053] an amusing picture of his schoolboy\r\nidleness, his love of play, and his tricks to escape the hated\r\ndeclamation which, in Roman schools, formed a weekly exercise:[1054]—\r\n\r\n  Sæpe oculos, memini, tangebam parvus olivo,\r\n  Grandia si nollem morituri verba Catonis\r\n  Discere non sano multum laudanda magistro,\r\n  Quæ pater adductis sudans audiret amicis.\r\n  Jure; etenim id summum, quid dexter senio ferret,\r\n  Scire erat in voto; damnosa canicula quantum\r\n  Raderet; angustæ collo non fallier orcæ;\r\n  Neu quis callidior buxum torquere flagello.\r\n\r\n  Oft, I remember yet, my sight to spoil,\r\n  Oft, when a boy, I bleared my eyes with oil:\r\n  What time I wished my studies to decline,\r\n  Nor make great Cato’s dying speeches mine;\r\n  Speeches my master to the skies had raised,\r\n  Poor pedagogue! unknowing what he praised;\r\n  And which my sire, suspense ’twixt hope and fear,\r\n  With venial pride, had brought his friends to hear.\r\n\r\n  For then, alas! ’twas my supreme delight\r\n  To study chances, and compute aright\r\n  What sum the lucky dice would yield in play,\r\n  And what the fatal aces sweep away;\r\n  Anxious no rival candidate for fame\r\n  Should hit the long-necked jar with nicer aim;\r\n  Nor, while the whirling top beguiled the eye,\r\n  With happier skill the sounding scourge apply.\r\n                                                           _Gifford._\r\n\r\nAt sixteen, Persius attached himself to the Stoic philosopher Annæus\r\nCornutus, by whom he was imbued with the stern philosophical principles\r\nwhich occupy so prominent a place in his Satires. The friendship which\r\nhe formed thus early in life continued until the day of his death. The\r\nyoung Lucan was also one of his intimate associates, whose philosophical\r\nand poetical tastes were similar to his own, and who had a profound\r\nadmiration for his writings. He was acquainted with Seneca, but had no\r\nvery great regard either for him or his works. Cæsius Bassus, to whom he\r\naddressed his sixth Satire, was also one of his intimates.[1055] It\r\nredounds greatly to his honour that he enjoyed the friendship of Pætus\r\nThrasea, one of the noblest examples of Roman virtue.[1056] Persius died\r\nprematurely of a disease in the stomach, at the age of twenty-eight. He\r\nleft a large fortune to his mother and sister; and his library,\r\nconsisting of seven hundred volumes, together with a considerable\r\npecuniary legacy, to his beloved tutor, Cornutus. The philosopher,\r\nhowever, disinterestedly gave up the money to the sister of his deceased\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nPure in mind and chaste in life, Persius was free from the corrupt taint\r\nof an immoral age. He exhibited all the self-denial, the control of the\r\npassions, and the stern uncompromising principles of the philosophy\r\nwhich he admired, but not its hypocrisy. Stoicism was not, in his case,\r\nas in that of so many others, a cloak for vice and profligacy.\r\n\r\nAlthough Lucretius was, to a certain extent, his model, he does not\r\nattack vice with the biting severity of the old satirist. He rather\r\nadopts the caustic irony of the old Greek comedy, as more in accordance\r\nwith that style of attack which he himself terms—\r\n\r\n                    petulanti splene cachinno.[1057]\r\n\r\nNor do we find in his writings the fiery ardour, the enthusiastic\r\nindignation, which burn in the verses of Juvenal; but this resulted from\r\nthe tenderness of his heart and the gentleness of his disposition, and\r\nnot from any disqualification for the duties of a moral instructor, such\r\nas weak moral principle, or irresolute timidity.\r\n\r\nAlthough he must have been conscious that the dangerous times during\r\nwhich his short life was passed rendered caution necessary, still it is\r\nfar more probable that his purity of mind and kindliness of heart\r\ndisinclined him to portray vice in its hideous and loathsome forms, and\r\nto indulge in bitterness of invective which prevalent enormities of his\r\ntimes deserved. It may be questioned whether obscenities like those of\r\nJuvenal, notwithstanding purity of intention, best promote the interests\r\nof virtue. It is to be feared that often the passions are excited and\r\nthe human heart rendered more corrupt by descriptions of vice, whilst\r\nthe moral lesson is disregarded.\r\n\r\nPersius evidently believed that reserve and silence, or those\r\nabominations which make the pure-minded shudder with horror, and call up\r\na blush upon the cheek of innocence, would more safely maintain the\r\ndignity and purity of virtue, than the divesting himself of that virgin\r\nmodesty (_virgineus ille pudor_) which constituted the great charm of\r\nhis character. His uprightness and love of virtue are shown by the\r\nuncompromising severity with which he rebukes sins of not so deep a die;\r\nand the heart which was capable of being moulded by his example, and\r\ninfluenced by his purity, would have shrunk from the fearful crimes\r\nwhich defile the pages of Juvenal.\r\n\r\nThe greatest defect in Persius, as a satirist, is, that the philosophy\r\nin which he was educated rendered him too indifferent to the affairs\r\nwhich were going on in the world around him. Politics had little\r\ninterest for him: he lived within himself a meditative life; wealth and\r\nsplendour he despised. His contemplative habits led him to criticise, as\r\nhis favourite subjects, false taste in poetry and empty pretensions to\r\nphilosophy. His modest and retiring nature found little sympathy with\r\nthe passions, the tumults, the business, or the pleasures which agitated\r\nRome. He was more a student of the closet than a man of the world.\r\nHorace mingled in the society of the profligate; he considered them as\r\nfools; and laughed their folly to scorn. Juvenal looked down upon the\r\ncorruption of the age from an eminence, where, involved in his virtue,\r\nhe was safe from moral pollution, and punished it like an avenging\r\ndeity. Persius, pure in heart and passionless by education, whilst he\r\nlashes wickedness in the abstract, almost ignores its existence, and\r\nmodestly shrinks from laying bare the secret pollutions of the human\r\nheart, and from probing its vileness to the bottom. The amiability, and\r\nabove all the disinterestedness, which characterize his Satires, fully\r\naccount for the popularity which they attained immediately on their\r\npublication by Cornutus, and the panegyrics of which he was the subject\r\nin later times. “Persius,” writes Quintilian,[1058] “multum et veræ\r\ngloriæ, quamvis uno libro meruit.” Many of the early Christian writers\r\nthought that his merits fully compensated for the obscurity of his\r\nstyle; and Gifford[1059] observes, “The virtue he recommends he\r\npractised in the fullest extent; and, at an age when few have acquired a\r\ndeterminate character, he left behind him an established reputation for\r\ngenius, learning, and worth.”\r\n\r\nThe works of Persius are comprised within the compass of six Satires,\r\ncontaining, in all, about 650 lines. And from the expression of\r\nQuintilian, already cited, and supported by a passage of Martial, there\r\nis reason to suppose that all he wrote is now extant. To his Satires is\r\nprefixed a short but spirited introduction in choliambics, _i. e._ lame\r\niambics, in which, for the iambus in the sixth place, there is\r\nsubstituted a spondee.\r\n\r\nThis proëmium bears but little relation to his work; but he was\r\naccustomed to similar irrelevancy in the parabases of the old Attic\r\ncomedy, which he had studied. In his first Satire he exposes and\r\naccounts for the false and immoral taste which affected poetry and\r\nforensic eloquence, attacks the coxcombry of public recitation, and\r\nparodies the style of contemporary writers, in language which our\r\nignorance of them prevents us from appreciating. In the second, which is\r\na congratulatory address to his dear friend Macrinus on his birthday, he\r\nimbodies the subject-matter of the second Alcibiades of Plato;[1060] a\r\ndialogue which Juvenal also had in view in the composition of his tenth\r\nSatire. In this poem, the degrading ideas which men have formed\r\nrespecting the Deity, the consequent selfishness and even impiety of\r\ntheir prayers, are followed by sentiments on the true nature of prayer,\r\nwhich even a Christian can read with admiration:—\r\n\r\n           Quin damus id superis, de magna quod dare lance\r\n         Non possit magni Messalæ lippa propago;\r\n         Compositum jus fasque animo sanctosque recessus\r\n         Mentis et incoctum generoso pectus honesto:\r\n         Hæc cedo, ut admoveam templis, et farre litabo.[1061]\r\n\r\n         No, let me bring the immortals what the race\r\n         Of great Messala, now depraved and base,\r\n         On their huge charger cannot,—bring a mind\r\n         Where legal and where moral sense are joined\r\n         With the pure essence; holy thoughts that dwell\r\n         In the soul’s most retired and sacred cell;\r\n         A bosom dyed in honour’s noblest grain—\r\n         Deep-dyed;—with these let me approach the fane,\r\n         And Heaven will hear the humble prayer I make,\r\n         Though all my offering be a barley-cake.\r\n\r\nIn the third, he endeavours to shame the ingenuous youth out of an idle\r\naversion to the pursuit of wisdom, and contrasts the enjoyments of a\r\nwell-regulated mind with ignorance and sensuality: the picture which he\r\ndraws of the fate of the sensualist is very powerful:—\r\n\r\n       Turgidus hic epulis atque albo ventre lavatur,\r\n       Gutture sulfureas lente exhalante mephites;\r\n       Sed tremor inter vina subit, calidumque trientem\r\n       Excutit e manibus; dentes crepuere retecti;\r\n       Uncta cadunt laxis tunc pulmentaria labris.\r\n       Hinc tuba, candelæ; tandemque beatulus, alto\r\n       Compositus lecto, crassisque lutatus amomis,\r\n       In portam rigidos calces extendit; at illum\r\n       Hesterni capite induto subiere Quirites.[1062]\r\n\r\n       Now to the bath, full gorged with luscious fare,\r\n       See the pale wretch his bloated carcass bear;\r\n       While from his lungs, that faintly play by fits,\r\n       His gasping throat sulphureous steam emits!\r\n       Cold shiverings seize him, as for wine he calls,\r\n       His grasp betrays him, and the goblet falls!\r\n       From his loose teeth the lip, convulsed, withdraws,\r\n       And the rich cates drop through his listless jaws.\r\n       Then trumpets, torches come, in solemn state;\r\n       And my fine youth, so confident of late,\r\n       Stretched on a splendid bier and essenced o’er,\r\n       Lies, a stiff corpse, heels foremost at the door;\r\n       Romans of yesterday, with covered head,\r\n       Shoulder him to the pyre, and—all is said.      _Gifford._\r\n\r\nOne more quotation must be made from this noble Satire, which is alluded\r\nto by St. Augustine,[1063] and in which Persius enunciates the sublime\r\ntruth, that the most fearful punishment which can befall the profligate\r\nis the consciousness of what they have lost in rejecting virtue:—\r\n\r\n       Magne pater divûm, sævos punire tyrannos\r\n       Haud alia ratione velis, quum dira libido\r\n       Moverit ingenium ferventi tincta veneno;\r\n       Virtutem videant intabescantque relicta![1064]\r\n\r\n       Dread sire of gods! when lust’s envenomed stings\r\n       Stir the fierce natures of tyrannic kings—\r\n       When storms of rage within their bosoms roll,\r\n       And call in thunder for thy just control—\r\n       O, then relax the bolt, suspend the blow,\r\n       And thus, and thus alone, thy vengeance show.\r\n       In all her charms, set Virtue in their eye,\r\n       And let them see their loss, despair, and—die.  _Gifford._\r\n\r\nIn the fourth Satire, Nero is represented in the character of\r\nAlcibiades; and Plato’s first Dialogue, which bears the name of the\r\nAthenian Libertine, furnished the foundation and many of the sentiments.\r\n\r\nThe fifth is the most elaborate of all the poet’s works. It is addressed\r\nto Cornutus, and is in the form of a dialogue between the philosopher\r\nand his pupil. The style is more finished than usual, and more adorned\r\nwith the graces of poetry; his amiable nature beams forth in all the\r\nwarmth of a grateful heart; and although he does not display any\r\noriginal philosophical research, he exhibits great learning, and an\r\naccurate acquaintance with the Stoic philosophy.\r\n\r\nIf the fifth Satire is the most elaborate, the sixth is, without doubt,\r\nthe most delightful of the works of Persius. It is addressed to his dear\r\nfriend Cæsius Bassus, and overflows with kindness of heart. The poet\r\nspeaks of the duties of contentment, and of ministering to the\r\ndistresses of others; the hatefulness of envy; the meanness of avarice,\r\nbeneath whatever disguise it may be veiled; his own determination to use\r\nand not abuse his fortune; whilst there may be traced through the whole\r\na foreboding, yet a cheerful one, that his weary course will soon be\r\nrun, and that his heir will soon succeed to his possessions.[1065]\r\n\r\nSuch was the character of Persius as mirrored in his little volume. The\r\ngloomy sullenness of Stoicism was not able to destroy the natural\r\namiability and placid cheerfulness of his temper. Its darkness affected\r\nhis style, but not his disposition. The fault which has been universally\r\nfound with the style of Persius, is difficulty and obscurity. This would\r\nbe the natural consequence of his Stoical education. The Stoics were\r\nproverbially obscure and dark in their teaching; and Persius, who had\r\nnot imbibed all the profoundness of their philosophy, had still caught\r\ntheir language and their manner of expression, and whilst he was\r\ninfected by their faults he acquired also their picturesqueness and\r\nliveliness of illustration. Nor does it appear that his style was\r\nconsidered obscure enough by his contemporaries to interfere with its\r\npopularity. It is probable that his obscurity is not absolute, but only\r\nrelative to the knowledge of the language possessed in modern times. His\r\nwas the conversational Latin of the days in which he lived; and as a\r\ngreat change had taken place from the Latin of Cicero and Livy to that\r\nof Tacitus and Seneca, doubtless the conversational Latin of Horace, and\r\neven of Juvenal, would differ from that of Persius. If this be the case,\r\nthe Satires of Persius constitute the only example of this Latin, and we\r\nhave no other by a comparison of which we can explain and illustrate his\r\nmodes of expression. Whatever, therefore, is unusual becomes at once a\r\nsource of difficulty and obscurity.[1066] The short description which\r\nPersius represents his preceptor as giving of his style, supports this\r\nassertion:—\r\n\r\n  Verba togæ sequeris junctura callidus acri\r\n  Ac teres modico, pallentes radere mores\r\n  Doctus et ingenuo culpam defigere ludo.[1067]\r\n\r\n  Confined to common life, thy numbers flow,\r\n  And neither soar too high, nor sink too low;\r\n  There strength and ease in graceful union meet,\r\n  Though polished, subtle, and though poignant, sweet;\r\n  Yet powerful to abash the front of crime,\r\n  And crimson error’s cheek with sportive rhyme.\r\n                                                           _Gifford._\r\n\r\nAs the _toga_ had, since the time of Augustus, been only worn by the\r\nhigher orders, whilst the common people were content with the _tunica_,\r\nit is clear that the words _verba togæ_ signify the language of polished\r\nsociety. One cause, therefore, of the difficulty of the style of Persius\r\nmay be our want of familiarity with the conversational Latin used in his\r\ntime by the superior classes. Excessive subtlety may have been mistaken\r\nfor refinement; and an affectation of philosophy, and an enigmatical\r\nstyle, may cause obscurity to us which was quite intelligible to his\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Persius had carefully studied, and was quite well\r\nacquainted with, the Satires of Horace; but the influence which Horace\r\nproduced upon his mind went no further than to impress upon his memory\r\ncertain phrases which he reproduced in a more perplexed form, more in\r\nunison with the fashionable Latin of his day. The expression of Horace—\r\n\r\n                       —— naso suspendis _adunco_\r\n                       Ignotos,[1068]\r\n\r\nbecomes, in the Satires of Persius—\r\n\r\n                _Excusso_ populum suspendere naso.[1069]\r\n\r\n                      Si vis me flere, dolendum est\r\n                Primum ipse tibi ——,[1070]\r\n\r\nbecomes, when paraphrased by his imitator—\r\n\r\n            Plorabit qui me volet incurvasse querela.[1071]\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of Horace in the words—\r\n\r\n                   Totus teres atque rotundus\r\n             Externi ne quid valeat per læve morari,[1072]\r\n\r\nis exchanged for the more involved phrase—\r\n\r\n                          Ut per læve severos\r\n                    Effundat junctura ungues.[1073]\r\n\r\nHe adopts Horace’s wish,[1074] preserving every idea in the passage—\r\n\r\n                        —— O si\r\n              Sub rastro crepet argenti mihi seria dextro\r\n              Herculæ.[1075]\r\n\r\nHorace’s acquirements in geometry—\r\n\r\n           Scilicet ut possem curvo dignoscere rectum,[1076]\r\n\r\nare thus awkwardly rendered—\r\n\r\n                     —— rectum discernis, ubi inter\r\n                     Curva subit.[1077]\r\n\r\nAnd, not to multiply examples which, whilst they show that Persius was\r\nan admirer of Horace, prove that what was pure, natural inspiration in\r\nthe latter, required effort in the former. The idea of Horace—\r\n\r\n                          Clamant periisse _pudorem_\r\n                    Cuncti pene patres,[1078]\r\n\r\nis exchanged by Persius for the forced metaphor——\r\n\r\n                          Exclamet Melicerta perisse\r\n                    _Frontem_ de rebus.[1079]\r\n\r\nRhetorical affectation infected all the literature of this age; we can\r\nscarcely, therefore, be surprised to find that it is one of the\r\ncharacteristics of the Satires of Persius. The age of public recitation\r\nhad already begun, of which Juvenal speaks some years later. When in one\r\nplace he describes the ardour and enthusiasm which pervaded Rome, on the\r\nannouncement of a new work by a popular author[1080]—\r\n\r\n               Curritur ad vocem jucundam et carmen amicæ\r\n               Thebaidos lætam fecit cum Statius urbem\r\n               Promisitque diem!\r\n\r\n               When Statius fixed a morning to recite\r\n               His Thebaid to the town with what delight\r\n               They flocked to him!\r\n\r\nIn another,[1081] like Horace, he complains of the annoyance of these\r\nrecitations; and in a third,[1082] he considers it one of the causes\r\nwhich rendered the most desolate and solitary country-place preferable\r\nto Rome.\r\n\r\nThe style of writing, therefore, suitable to this practice, was a\r\ndeclamatory one, as the practice itself was in accordance with the\r\noratorical tastes of the Roman people.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                JUVENAL.\r\n\r\nDecimus Junius Juvenalis, according to the few lines of biography\r\ngenerally attributed to Suetonius, was the son, or the adopted son, of a\r\nwealthy freedman. He amused himself with rhetoric and declamation until\r\nmiddle life; but having, on one occasion, written a short satire upon\r\nParis, the pantomime, he was tempted to apply himself to this species of\r\nwriting. After some time he recited his piece with such success to a\r\nlarge audience, that he inserted it in one of his later\r\ncompositions.[1083] He thus exposed himself to the enmity of the court,\r\nbecause his lines were supposed figuratively to apply to an actor who\r\nwas a court favourite, and he was exiled to Egypt, under pretence of\r\nbeing appointed to the command of a cohort. There in a short time he\r\ndied of grief at the age of eighty.\r\n\r\nThe time of his birth is unknown, but he must have flourished in the\r\nreign of Domitian, towards the close of the first century after Christ;\r\nand it is generally assumed that he was either born, or resided, at the\r\nVolscian town which subsequently gave birth to the eminent schoolman,\r\nThomas Aquinas.[1084] Thus the greater portion of the life of Juvenal\r\nwas passed during a period of political horror and misery. The short\r\nreign of Vespasian was doubtless a blessing to Rome, but it was only a\r\nbrief temporary respite: the dark period of the last ten Cæsars saw the\r\nutter moral degradation of the people, and the bloodiest tyranny and\r\noppression on the part of their rulers. If, which is most probable, he\r\nlived to see the reigns of Nerva, Trajan, and Hadrian, the spirits of\r\nthe noble-minded satirist must have revived at seeing again a promise of\r\nnational glory and prosperity. In the period gone by, rich as it was in\r\nmaterial for his pen, it was fatally perilous to give utterance to his\r\nburning indignation; but an opportunity, not to be lost, was then\r\noffered when emperors ruled, who were distinguished for ability and\r\nvirtue, when justice and the laws were constitutionally administered,\r\nand the empire, wisely governed, enjoyed security and tranquillity.\r\n\r\nThe picture of Roman manners, as painted by the glowing pencil of\r\nJuvenal, is truly appalling. The fabric of society was in ruins. The\r\npopular religion was rejected with scorn, and its place was not occupied\r\neven by the creed of natural religion. Nothing remained but the empty\r\npomp, pageant and ceremonial. The administration of the state was a mass\r\nof corruption: freedmen and foreigners, full of artful cunning, but\r\ndestitute of principle, had the ear of the sovereign, and filled their\r\ncoffers with bribes and confiscation. The grave and decent reserve which\r\nwas characteristic of every Roman, in olden times, was thrown off even\r\nby the higher classes; and emperors took a public part in scenes of\r\nfolly and profligacy, and exposed themselves as charioteers, as dancers,\r\nand as actors. Nothing was respected but wealth—nothing provoked\r\ncontempt but poverty.[1085] A vote was only valued for its worth in\r\nmoney; that people, whose power was once absolute, would now sell their\r\nsouls for bread and the Circensian games.\r\n\r\nPlayers and dancers had all honours and offices at their disposal. The\r\ncity swarmed with informers who made the rich their prey: every man\r\nfeared even his most intimate friend. To be noble, virtuous, innocent,\r\nwas no protection: the only bond of friendship was to be an accomplice\r\nin crime. Philosophy was a cheat, and moral teaching an hypocrisy. The\r\nmoralists “preached like Curii, but lived like bacchanals.”[1086] The\r\nvery teacher would do his best to corrupt his pupil: the guardian would\r\ndefraud his ward. Luxury and extravagance brought men to ruin, which\r\nthey sought to repair by flattering the childless, legacy-hunting, and\r\ngambling; and even patricians would cringe for a morsel of bread. The\r\nhigher classes were selfish and cruel, grinding and insolent to their\r\ninferiors and dependants.[1087] Gluttony was so disgusting that six\r\nthousand sesterces (50_l._) would be given for a mullet; and the glutton\r\nwould artificially relieve his stomach of its load, in order to prepare\r\nfor another meal.[1088] Crimes which cannot be named were common: men,\r\nfor the worst of purposes, endeavoured to make themselves look like\r\nwomen; and even an emperor personated a female, and was given in\r\nmarriage to one of his Greek favourites.[1089] The streets of Rome were\r\nas dangerous as the Pomptine marshes or the Italian forests, from\r\nconstant robbery, assault, and assassination.\r\n\r\nThe morals of the female sex were as depraved as those of men: ladies of\r\nnoble and royal blood would have lovers in their pay, and when they had\r\nlost the attraction of personal charms, would supply their place by the\r\ntemptation of gold. One empress publicly celebrated her nuptials with an\r\nadulterer in the absence of her lord; another gratified her wantonness\r\nby prostitution. Even those who were not so profligate aped the manners\r\nand habits of men, and would even meet in mock combat; and there was no\r\npublic amusement so immoral or so cruel as not to be disgraced by the\r\npresence of the female sex. Licentiousness led to murder; and poisoning\r\nby women was as common as it was in France and Italy in the sixteenth\r\ncentury.[1090]\r\n\r\nTimes like these would even have shocked the urbane and gentle Horace.\r\nHad he then lived, he would probably have thought such vice beyond\r\nridicule, and his tone might have approached more nearly to the\r\nthundering indignation of Juvenal. “Society in the age of Horace was\r\nbecoming corrupt; in that of Juvenal it was in a state of\r\nputrefaction.”[1091]\r\n\r\nIn this period of moral dearth the fountains of genius and literature\r\nwere dried up. The orator dared not impeach the corrupt politician, or\r\ndefend the victim of tyranny, when every one thought the best way to\r\nsecure his own safety was by trampling on the fallen favourite, now\r\nCæsar’s enemy.[1092] The historian dared not utter his real sentiments.\r\nPoetry grew cold without the genial, fostering encouragement of noble\r\nand affectionate hearts. There was criticism, grammar, declamation,\r\npanegyric and verse-writing, but not oratory, history, or poetry.\r\nJuvenal, though himself not free from the declamatory affectation of the\r\nday, attacked the false literary taste of his contemporaries as\r\nunsparingly as he did their depraved morality. From Sejanus to Cluvienus\r\nhe allowed no one to escape.\r\n\r\nBut noble as Juvenal’s hatred of vice must be allowed to be, and\r\nfearless as are his denunciations, we look in vain throughout his poetry\r\nfor indications of an amiable and kind-hearted disposition. He was not\r\none to recall the lost and erring to a love of virtue, or to inspire a\r\npure and enthusiastic taste for literature. His prejudices were violent;\r\nhe could see nothing good in a Greek or a freedman: he hated the new\r\naristocracy with as bitter a hatred as Sallust. As a critic he is\r\nill-natured; as a moralist he is stern and misanthrophic. Mark, for\r\nexample, the gloomy bitterness with which he speaks of old age,[1093]\r\nand contrast it with the bright side of the picture, as drawn by the\r\ngentle Cicero in his incomparable treatise.\r\n\r\nDeficient, however, as he was in the softer affections, his sixteen\r\nSatires exhibit an enlightened, truthful, and comprehensive view of\r\nRoman manners, and of the inevitable result of such corruption. Those\r\nwhose moral taste was utterly destroyed would read and listen without\r\nprofit, but they could not but tremble: his words are truth. The\r\nconclusion of the thirteenth Satire is almost Christian. It is\r\nunnecessary to quote from an author who is in every scholar’s memory: it\r\nwould even occupy too much space to make a fair selection from so many\r\nfine passages. The eleventh Satire is the most pleasing, and most\r\npartaking of the playfulness of Horace. The seventh displays the\r\ngreatest versatility and the richest fund of anecdote. The twelfth is\r\nthe most amiable. The description of the origin of civil society in the\r\nconclusion of the fifteenth is full of sound sense and just sentiments;\r\nwhilst the way in which he speaks of the insane bigotry of the\r\nEgyptians, exhibits his power of combining pleasantry with dignity. But\r\nthe two finest Satires are those[1094] which our own Johnson has thought\r\nworthy of imitation: one of which (the tenth) Bishop Burnet, in his\r\nPastoral Charge, recommended to his clergy; and the noblest passage in\r\nthem is that which describes the fall of the infamous Sejanus.[1095] Few\r\nmen could be so well adapted to transfer the spirit of Juvenal into\r\nEnglish as Dr. Johnson. He had the same rude, plain-spoken,\r\nuncompromising hatred of vice; and, though not unamiable, did his best\r\nto conceal what amiability he possessed under a forbidding exterior. He\r\nwas not without gayety and sprightliness; but he concealed it under that\r\nstateliness and declamatory grandeur which he attributes to Juvenal.\r\n\r\nThe historical value of Juvenal’s Satires must not be forgotten. Tacitus\r\nlived in the same perilous times as he did; and when they had come to an\r\nend, and it was not unsafe to speak, he wrote their public history.\r\nJuvenal illustrates that history by displaying the social inner life of\r\nthe Romans.[1096] Their works are parallel, and each forms a commentary\r\nupon the other. When such were the lives of individuals, one cannot\r\nwonder at the fate of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe style of Juvenal is, generally speaking, the reflex of his mind: his\r\nviews were strong and clear: his style is vigorous and lucid also. His\r\nmorals were pure in the midst of a debased age: his language shines\r\nforth in classic elegance in the midst of specimens of declining and\r\ndegenerate taste. His style is declamatory, but it is not artificially\r\nrhetorical. He could not restrain himself from following the example of\r\nLucilius: he could not dam up the torrent of his vehement and natural\r\neloquence. Whether his subject is noble or disgusting, his word-painting\r\nis perfect: we feel his sublimity—we shudder at his fidelity. The nature\r\nof the subject causes his language to be frequently gross and offensive;\r\nbut his object always is to lay bare the deformity of vice, and to\r\nrender it loathsome. He never indulges in indecency, in order to pander\r\nto a corrupt taste or to gratify a prurient imagination. For this reason\r\nhis pages are less dangerous than those of more elegant and less\r\nindecent writers, who throw a veil over indelicacy, whilst they leave\r\nthose qualities which blind the moral vision and inflame the passions.\r\nIt must be remembered, also, that neither the dress, manners, nor\r\nconversation of ancient Rome were so decent and modest as those of\r\nmodern times; and, therefore, Roman taste would not be so shocked by\r\nplain speaking as would be the case in an age of greater social\r\nrefinement. Juvenal closes the list of Roman satirists, properly\r\nspeaking: the satirical spirit animates the piquant epigrams of his\r\nfriend Martial; but their purpose is not moral or didactic: they sting\r\nthe individual, and render him an object of scorn and disgust, but they\r\ndo not hold up vice itself to ridicule and detestation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\nBIOGRAPHY OF LUCAN—INSCRIPTION TO HIS MEMORY—SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED IN THE\r\n        PHARSALIA—LUCAN AN UNEQUAL POET—FAULTS AND MERITS OF THE\r\n    PHARSALIA—CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS AGE—DIFFICULTIES OF HISTORICAL\r\n  POETRY—LUCAN A DESCRIPTIVE POET—SPECIMENS OF HIS POETRY—BIOGRAPHY OF\r\n  SILIUS ITALICUS—HIS CHARACTER BY PLINY—HIS POEM DULL AND TEDIOUS—HIS\r\n                        DESCRIPTION OF THE ALPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   M. ANNÆUS LUCANUS (BORN A. D. 39.)\r\n\r\nAt the head of the epic poets who flourished during the silver age\r\nstands Lucan. He was a member of the same family as the Senecas, for the\r\nsame rhetorician of that name was his grandfather, and the Stoic\r\nphilosopher his uncle. Another of his uncles, also, L. Junius Gallio, is\r\nmentioned in the Eusebian Chronicle as a celebrated rhetorician. This\r\nGallio derived his surname from being the adopted son of Jun. Gallio,\r\nwho, by some, is supposed to have been the proconsul of Achaia,\r\nmentioned in the Acts of the Apostles.[1097]\r\n\r\nThe father of Lucan, M. Annæus Mela, was a Roman knight, who made a\r\nlarge fortune as a collector of the imperial revenue. He is supposed by\r\nsome to have been identical with the geographer Pomponius Mela, who was\r\nthe author of a brief description, in three books, of the coasts of\r\nEurope, Asia, and Africa. The style of this writer is concise, as is\r\nsuitable to a mere sketch or abridgment; and his matter, although\r\nderived from other sources, and not from personal observation, is\r\naccurate and interesting. The poet was born at Corduba (Cordova,) on the\r\nbeautiful banks of the Bætis (Guadalquiver.) His birthplace is thus\r\nelegantly alluded to by Statius, in a poem addressed to his widow, on\r\nthe anniversary of his birth:—\r\n\r\n     Vatis Apollinei magno memorabilis ortu\r\n       Lux redit, Aonidum turba favete sacris.\r\n     Hæc meruit, cum te terris Lucane dedisset\r\n       Mixtus Castaliæ Bætis ut esset aquæ.\r\n                                                  _Stat. Genethl._\r\n\r\nPliny tells us that on his infant lips, as on those of Hesiod, a swarm\r\nof bees settled, and thus gave presage of his poetical career; a tale\r\nwhich owes its origin entirely to the Greek tradition. Much which rests\r\nupon no foundation has been mixed up with the extant lives of Lucan; for\r\nexample, the favour shown to him, whilst a child, by Nero; his\r\nconsequent elevation in his boyhood to the rank of a senator; and his\r\ndefeat of the emperor in a poetical contest at the quinquennial games,\r\ninstituted by the latter, in which no one entered with any other view\r\nthan that their royal antagonist might have the credit of a mock\r\nvictory.[1098] The enmity of the jealous emperor can be accounted for\r\nwithout having recourse to so insane a competition.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Lucan was very young when he came to Rome; that his\r\nliterary reputation was soon established; and that Nero, who could not\r\nbear the idea of a rival, forbade him to recite his poems, which was now\r\nthe common mode of publication. Nor was he content with silencing him as\r\na poet, but also would not allow him to plead as an advocate.[1099]\r\nSmarting under this provocation he hastily joined a conspiracy against\r\nthe emperor’s life, and signalized himself by the bitterness of his\r\nhatred against his powerful enemy. The ringleader of this plot was\r\nPiso,[1100] a tragic poet of some talent, a skilful orator, and a\r\nmunificent man. But he was deficient in decision and infirm of purpose:\r\nthe plot therefore failed. When Lucan’s passion cooled he as quickly\r\nrepented, and was pardoned on condition of pointing out his\r\nconfederates. In the vain hope of saving himself from the monster’s\r\nvengeance, he actually impeached his mother. The upright historian\r\ncontrasts this stain on the poet’s character with the courage which\r\nEpicharis displayed. This noble woman was incapable of treason. Tacitus\r\ndescribes the resolution with which she scorned the question.[1101] “The\r\nscourge, the flames, the rage of the executioners, who tortured her the\r\nmore savagely, lest they should be scorned by a woman, were powerless to\r\nextort a false confession.” Lucan never received the reward which he\r\npurchased by treachery. The warrant for his death was issued, and he\r\ncaused his veins to be cut asunder. As the stream of his life’s blood\r\nflowed away, he repeated from his own poem the description of a soldier\r\nexpiring from his wounds.[1102] He died in the twenty-seventh year of\r\nhis age; and the following inscription to his memory has been attributed\r\nto Nero:—\r\n\r\n                    M. Annæo Lucano Cordubensi Poetæ\r\n                    Beneficio Neronis. Fama servata.\r\n\r\nThe sentiments contained in the Pharsalia, so far as he dared express\r\nthem, breathe a love of freedom, and an attachment to the old Roman\r\nrepublicanism. Although the imperial patronage which he at first\r\nenjoyed, and, perhaps, the better promise of the commencement of Nero’s\r\nreign, tempted him to indulge in courtly flattery; still, even at that\r\ntime, his praises of liberty evidently came from the heart. As the poem\r\nproceeds his sentiments become more exalted; his virtuous indignation\r\ngradually rises, until it pours forth a torrent of burning satire on the\r\ninhuman tyrant. This poem, the only one of his works which survives, is\r\nan epic in ten books; its subject, the civil war between Cæsar and\r\nPompey. It bears evident marks of having been left unfinished, and of\r\nnot having received the last touches from the hand of the author. It was\r\npreceded by four other shorter poems—the first on the Death of Hector;\r\nthe second on the Visit of Orpheus to the Infernal Regions; the third,\r\non the Burning of Rome; the fourth addressed to his wife Polla\r\nArgentaria. He also wrote some prose works; and Martial attributes to\r\nhim some poems on lighter subjects.[1103]\r\n\r\nLucan is an unequal poet: his Pharsalia is defaced with great faults and\r\nblemishes; but at the same time it possesses peculiar beauties. Its\r\nsubject is a noble one and full of historic interest, and is treated\r\nwith spirit, brilliance, and animation. Its arrangement is that of\r\nannals, and therefore it wants the unity of an epic poem: it has not the\r\nconnectedness of history, because the poet naturally selected only the\r\nmost striking and romantic incidents; and yet, notwithstanding these\r\ndefects in the plan, the historical pictures themselves are beautifully\r\ndrawn. The characters of Cæsar and Pompey, for example, are\r\nmaster-pieces. Again, some passages have neither the dignity of prose\r\nnor the melody of poetry; whilst others are scarcely inferior to any\r\nwritten by the best Latin poets. This inequality has caused the great\r\ndiversity of opinions which have been held by critics respecting the\r\nmerits of Lucan. Some have unjustly depreciated him; others, as\r\ngroundlessly, have lauded him to the skies. Quintilian commended his\r\nardent enthusiasm and lucidity of expression,[1104] but qualified his\r\npraise by adding, that he would be admired by orators rather than by\r\npoets. Corneille preferred him to Virgil, of whom he was obviously a\r\nwarm admirer. His poem furnishes materials and reason for this diversity\r\nof judgment; but it may safely be asserted that his faults are due to\r\nthe age in which he lived, whilst his beauties were the fruits and\r\ndevelopments of his own native genius. His principal merit is\r\noriginality: although he was not great enough to lead the taste of the\r\nage, and to rise superior to its false principles, he did not condescend\r\nto be a servile imitator even of those poets whose reputation was firmly\r\nestablished. There are many parallelisms between his poetry and that of\r\nVirgil, but they are the parallelisms of a student, not of a plagiarist.\r\n\r\nWithout adopting the unauthorized assumptions, found in some of his\r\nbiographies, that he was educated under the immediate superintendence of\r\nhis uncle Seneca, that Remmius Palæmon taught him grammar, Virginius\r\nFlaccus rhetoric, and Cornutus philosophy, it is clear that his taste\r\nwas formed and his talents drawn out in an age, the characteristics of\r\nwhich were pedantic erudition, inflated rhetoric, and dogmatic\r\nphilosophy. It is clear, also, that even though Seneca was not his\r\ntutor, still the conceit and affectation which dimmed the transcendent\r\nabilities of the philosopher, exercised a baneful influence over the\r\nliterary taste of his contemporaries. In the midst of these influences\r\nLucan was educated, and for that reason his poem is disfigured by\r\ncommonplace maxims, pompous diction, an affectation of learning, a\r\nrhetorical exuberance which outstripped its subjects, and therefore\r\nproduces the effect of frigidity. In a poem, the characters and events\r\nof which are historical, the real is in too strong contrast to the\r\nideal, hence the effect of both is marred. The fidelity expected of the\r\nhistorian circumscribes the creative power of the poet. To the poet who\r\nconstructs his work out of the materials of epochs which are beyond the\r\nreach of history, the whole field of the past is open. The only limits\r\nwithin which he must restrain his genius are those of the probable:\r\nwithin these bounds he may conjure up the most magnificent ideal forms;\r\nhe may use the most gorgeous imagery, the most supernatural machinery:\r\nthe whole wears an air of historic truth; as there are no realities with\r\nwhich his ideal can be compared and tested, truth never appears to be\r\nviolated.\r\n\r\nBut in history, almost contemporaneous with the age of the poet, every\r\ncircumstance is recorded, every character well known and estimated. If\r\nan act of bravery is exaggerated into one of superhuman heroism, or one\r\nwho is known to have been a man, although a great man, recast in the\r\nheroic mould, we are struck at once with the falsehood: and therefore\r\nthe poet cannot venture on such efforts of genius. In a train of events,\r\nwhich the page of history enables us to trace from the beginning to the\r\nend, no difficulties can occur deserving of supernatural machinery, no\r\n_dignus vindice nodus_; and thus, in the place of the Olympian Pantheon\r\nof Homer and Virgil, Lucan can only deify the popular but unpoetical\r\nprinciple of chance, and personify Fortune.\r\n\r\nThis position may appear inconsistent with the charm which confessedly\r\nbelongs to the modern historical romance; but then it is to be\r\nremembered, that the interest we take in the historical portions is\r\npurely historical, enlivened by the events grouping themselves round the\r\nhero: in fact, the interest of biography is united with that of history.\r\nThe strictest accuracy, therefore, in matters which fall within the\r\nrange of history is perfectly compatible. The romantic interest depends\r\non the inner or social life of the characters—which forms no part of\r\nhistory—in which, as there is no standard of comparison, the imagination\r\nof the poet is quite free and unfettered. But this is totally different\r\nfrom the plan on which such a poem as the Pharsalia is constructed. The\r\nvision of the genius of Rome which appeared to Cæsar at the fatal\r\nRubicon, those which haunt the slumbers of the Cæsareans in the\r\nplundered camp of Pompey, and the dream of Pompey, in which the secrets\r\nof the infernal regions are laid open by the shade of his departed wife\r\nJulia, are the nearest approaches to that invisible world which the\r\nimagination of Homer disclosed, and which Virgil reproduced;[1105] but\r\nthese are only isolated passages.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to be at once an historian and a poet: in the one\r\ncharacter the author must restrain the flights of his imagination; in\r\nthe other, he must sacrifice truth. Nor is there any doubt of which\r\ncharacter we demand the conservation, when matters of history are\r\nconcerned. We desiderate truth: we wish moot points to be settled and\r\ndoubts solved. All imaginative pictures we look upon as interruptions,\r\nand cast them aside as warping the judgment and giving prejudiced views.\r\nHence, our admiration of Lucan is called forth, not by considering his\r\npoem as an epic, but for the sake of isolated scenes, such as the naval\r\nvictory off Marseilles; splendid descriptions, such as that of the\r\ncruelties of Marius and Sulla; felicitous comparisons, that, for\r\nexample, of Pompey to an aged oak; and the epigrammatic terseness which\r\ngives force, as well as beauty, to his sayings. In a single line, for\r\ninstance—\r\n\r\n               Pauperiorque fuit tunc primum Cæsare Roma—\r\n\r\nhe describes the wealth and avarice of the conqueror, and in the\r\nwell-known verse—\r\n\r\n              Victrix causa Diis placuit sed victa Catoni—\r\n\r\nhe depicts the disinterestedness of Cato. To this may be added, that the\r\nsubject of the Pharsalia is, although a period of the deepest historical\r\ninterest, ill adapted to poetry. Events so nearly contemporary were\r\nfitter for history and panegyric than for poetry; and although they give\r\nscope for descriptive power and bold imagery, they are deficient in that\r\nmysterious and romantic character which is required for an epic poem.\r\nHis imagination was rich—his enthusiasm refused to be curbed. They were\r\nsuch as we might suppose would be nurtured by the warm and sunny climate\r\nof Spain. His sentiments often exhibit that chivalrous tone which\r\ndistinguishes the Spanish poets of modern times. We may discern the\r\nnobleness, the liberality, the courage, which once marked the high-born\r\nSpanish gentleman; and the grave and thoughtful wisdom which makes\r\nSpanish literature so rich in proverbs, and which peeps out even from\r\nunder the unreal conventionalisms of the contemporary Roman philosophy.\r\n\r\nDescription forms the principal feature in the poetry of Lucan; it\r\noccupies more than one half of the Pharsalia; so that it might almost as\r\nappropriately be termed a descriptive as an epic poem. Description, in\r\nfact, constitutes one of the characteristic features of Roman literature\r\nin its decline, because poetry had more than ever become an art, and the\r\nepoch one of erudition; and thus a treasure of imagery was stored up\r\nsuitable for descriptive embellishment. The finest parts of Persius are\r\ndescriptive: even Martial, brief though his pieces are, delights in it;\r\nand facility in this department is the strong point of Silius Italicus,\r\nand the sole merit of Valerius Flaccus. Owing to the enthusiasm with\r\nwhich Lucan throws himself into this kind of writing, he abounds in\r\nminute detail. He reminds one of the descriptive talent possessed in so\r\neminent a degree by our own Thomson. Not a feature escapes his notice,\r\nwhether it suggest ideas of the beautiful, the sublime, or the terrible.\r\nHe is not content, as Virgil is, with a sketch—with broad lights and\r\nshadows; he delights in a finished picture; he possesses the power of\r\nplacing his subject strongly before the eyes, leaving little or nothing\r\nfor the imagination to supply. He omits no means of attaining\r\ndescriptive truth;[1106] the inward state of feeling, the character of\r\neach passion, is presented, not so much in its moral and psychical as in\r\nits physical developments; that which is internal is exhibited in its\r\nexternal symptoms, with the hand of a painter and the skill of the\r\nphysiognomist. Virgil sketches, Lucan paints; the latter describes\r\nphysically—the former philosophically. The following passages, which\r\ndescribe the passage of the Rubicon and the death of Pompey, are noble\r\nspecimens of Lucan’s style:—\r\n\r\n        Jam gelidas Cæsar cursu superaverat Alpes,\r\n        Ingentesque animo motus, bellumque futurum\r\n        Ceperat. Ut ventum est parvi Rubiconis ad undas,\r\n        Ingens visa duci patriæ trepidantis imago,\r\n        Clara per obscuram vultu mœstissima noctem\r\n        Turrigero canos effundens vertice crines,\r\n        Cæsarie lacera, nudisque adstare lacertis,\r\n        Et gemitu permixta loqui! Quo tenditis ultra?\r\n        Quo fertis mea signa, viri? Si jure venitis,\r\n        Si cives, huc usque licet.

SILIUS ITALICUS.\r\n\r\nC. Silius Italicus was born in the reign of Tiberius, A. D. 25. The\r\nplace of his birth is unknown. His surname, Italicus, has led some to\r\nsuppose that he was a native of Italica, in Spain. But it is not\r\nprobable that, if this were the case, his friend and fellow-courtier\r\nMartial, when he compared his eloquence to that of Cicero, and his\r\npoetry to that of Virgil,[1107] called him the glory of the Castalian\r\nsisters,[1108] and felicitated him on his political honours, would have\r\nforgotten to claim him as a countryman. Others, with somewhat more show\r\nof reason, have imagined that his birthplace was the city of Corfinium,\r\nin Pelignia, which was called Italica,[1109] because it was the\r\nhead-quarters of the confederates in the social war; whilst Stephens\r\nmentions a little town in Sicily, of the same name, which might have\r\nbeen his native place.[1110]\r\n\r\nSilius was celebrated as an advocate; but in that age of affected and\r\nrhetorical display, a high reputation does not prove that his eloquence,\r\nalthough it might have displayed a similar elegance of language, was\r\nmore lively and stirring than his poetry. He was consul A. D. 68; an\r\noffice which was also filled by his son,[1111] and by another member of\r\nhis family.[1112] He was afterwards proconsul of Asia; the duties of\r\nwhich lucrative office he appears to have performed with credit to\r\nhimself. He was very wealthy; and, as he grew old, retired from the\r\nperils of public life to enjoy his affluence, and the retirement of\r\nliterary ease in his numerous villas. One cannot be surprised that an\r\norator and a poet especially delighted in the house of Virgil, near\r\nNaples, and the Academy of Cicero, of both which he was the fortunate\r\npossessor. He lived to the age of seventy-five, and then starved himself\r\nto death, because he could not bear the pain of disease. “I have just\r\nbeen informed,” writes Pliny the Younger, to his friend Caninius,[1113]\r\n“that Silius Italicus has put an end to his existence by starvation, at\r\nhis Neapolitan villa. He had an incurable carbuncle, from the annoyance\r\nof which he took refuge in death, with a firm and irrevocable constancy.\r\nHe enjoyed happiness and prosperity to his dying day, if we except the\r\nloss of the younger of his two sons; but the elder and superior one\r\nsurvived him in the enjoyment of prosperity, and even of consular rank.\r\nThe belief that he had voluntarily come forward as a public accuser\r\ninjured his reputation in the reign of Nero; but, as a friend of\r\nVitellius, his conduct was wise and his behaviour courteous. His career\r\nin the proconsulate of Asia was an honourable one, for he washed out the\r\nstain of his former activity by a praiseworthy abstinence from public\r\naffairs. He had no influence with the great; but then he was safe from\r\nenvy. All courted him, and were assiduous in paying their respects to\r\nhim; and as ill health confined him to his bed, his chamber was thronged\r\nwith visitors, beyond what might have been expected from his rank and\r\nstation. Whenever he could spare time for writing, he passed it in\r\nlearned conversation. His poems display elaborate care rather than\r\ngenius: sometimes he invited criticism by recitations. Yielding to the\r\nsuggestion of advancing years, he at length retired from Rome, and\r\nresided in Campania; nor had the accession of a new emperor (Trajan)\r\npower to entice him from his retirement. High praise to the monarch\r\nunder whose rule he was free to act so!—high praise to him who had\r\ncourage to use that freedom! His love of virtù caused in him a\r\nreprehensible passion for buying: he was the possessor of more than one\r\nvilla in the same localities; and he so delighted in the newest purchase\r\nas to neglect that which he inhabited before. He had a vast collection\r\nof books, besides statues and busts, which he not only possessed, but\r\nalmost worshipped. He kept Virgil’s birthday more religiously than his\r\nown, and had more busts of him than any one else, especially at Naples,\r\nwhere he was in the habit of visiting his tomb, as if it were a temple.\r\nIn this tranquil retirement he exceeded his seventy-fifth year, his\r\nconstitution being delicate rather than weakly. As he was the last\r\nconsul made by Nero, so he died the last of those whom he had made. It\r\nis also worthy of remark that the consul, in whose year of office Nero\r\ndied, died the last of Nero’s consuls. When I call this to mind, I feel\r\ncompassion for human frailty: for what is so brief as the longest span\r\nof human life!”\r\n\r\nLittle interest attaches to the biography of one who owed a life of\r\nuninterrupted prosperity to his being the favourite and intimate of two\r\nemperors; the one, a blood-thirsty tyrant—the other, a gross\r\nsensualist.[1114] His ponderous work survives—the dullest and most\r\ntedious poem in the Latin language. Its title is “_Punica_:” it consists\r\nof seventeen books, and contains a history in heroic verse of the second\r\nPunic war. The Æneid of Virgil was his model, and the narrative of Livy\r\nfurnished his materials. Niebuhr states that he read through the whole\r\nof his works with great care, and that he was quite convinced that he\r\nhad taken every thing from Livy, of whose work his is only a\r\nparaphrase.[1115] The criticism of Pliny the Younger is, upon the whole,\r\njust: “_Scribebat carmina majori cura quam ingenio_;” for, although it\r\nis impossible to read his poem with pleasure as a whole, his\r\nversification is harmonious, and will often, in point of smoothness,\r\nbear comparison with that of Virgil. The following passage is quoted by\r\nC. Barthius as one of the most favourable specimens of his sentiments\r\nand style; and Cellarius, whose praise is extravagantly fulsome, gives\r\nit the epithet of “Aurea:”—\r\n\r\n             Ipsa quidem virtus sibimet pulcherrima merces;\r\n             Dulce tamen venit ad manes quem gloria vitæ\r\n             Durat apud superos, nec edunt oblivia laudem.\r\n\r\nSome of his episodes, if considered as separate pieces, will repay the\r\ntrouble of perusal; and the following passage, which Addison thought\r\nworthy of translation, may be taken as a fair specimen of his\r\ndescriptive powers:—\r\n\r\n                        THE ALPS.\r\n\r\n      Cuncta gelu canâque æternum grandine tecta,\r\n      Atque ævi glaciem cohibent: riget ardua montis\r\n      Ætherii facies, surgentique obvia Phœbo\r\n      Duratas nescit flammis mollire pruinas.\r\n      Quantum Tartareus regni pallentis hiatus\r\n      Ad manes imos atque atræ stagna paludis\r\n      A supera tellure patet; tam longa per auras\r\n      Erigitur tellus et cœlum intercipit umbrà.\r\n      Nullum ver usquam, nullique æstatis honores;\r\n      Sola jugis habitat diris sedesque tuetur\r\n      Perpetuas deformis hyems: illa undique nubes\r\n      Huc atras agit et mixtos cum grandine nimbos.\r\n      Nam cuncti flatus ventique furentia regna\r\n      Alpinâ posuere domo caligat in altis\r\n      Obtutus saxis, abeuntque in nubila montes.\r\n\r\n      Stiff with eternal ice, and hid in snow,\r\n      That fell a thousand centuries ago,\r\n      The mountain stands; nor can the rising sun\r\n      Unfix her frosts and teach them how to run:\r\n      Deep as the dark infernal waters lie\r\n      From the bright regions of the cheerful sky,\r\n      So far the proud ascending rocks invade\r\n      Heaven’s upper realms, and cast a dreadful shade.\r\n      No spring, no summer, on the mountain seen,\r\n      Smiles with gay fruits or with delightful green,\r\n      But hoary winter, unadorned and bare,\r\n      Dwells in the dire retreat and freezes there,\r\n      There she assembles all her blackest storms,\r\n      And the rude hail or rattling tempests forms;\r\n      Thither the loud tumultuous winds resort,\r\n      And on the mountain keep their boisterous court,\r\n      That in thick showers her rocky summit shrouds,\r\n      And darkens all the broken view with clouds.      _Addison._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\nC. VALERIUS FLACCUS—FAULTS OF THE ARGONAUTICA—PAPINIUS STATIUS—BEAUTY OF\r\n HIS MINOR POEMS—INCAPABLE OF EPIC POETRY—DOMITIAN—EPIGRAM—MARTIAL—HIS\r\n   BIOGRAPHY—PROFLIGACY OF THE AGE IN WHICH HE LIVED—IMPURITY OF HIS\r\n              WRITINGS—FAVOURABLE SPECIMENS OF HIS POETRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          C. VALERIUS FLACCUS.\r\n\r\nC. Valerius Flaccus flourished in the reign of Vespasian; and, according\r\nto an epigram of Martial, in which the poet advises his friend to leave\r\nthe Muses for the drier but more profitable profession of a pleader, he\r\nwas born at Patavium[1116] (Padua.) The frequent addition of the\r\nsurnames Setinus Balbus have caused it to be supposed that he was a\r\nnative of Setia, in Campania (Sezzo;) but it is impossible to form any\r\nsatisfactory conjecture as to their signification, and the statement of\r\nMartial is too definite to admit of a doubt. Quintilian[1117] asserts\r\nthat, when he wrote, V. Flaccus had _lately_ died: he was, therefore,\r\nprobably cut off prematurely about A. D. 88.\r\n\r\nHis only poem which is extant is entitled “_Argonautica_,” and is an\r\nimitation, and, in some parts, a translation, of the Greek poem of\r\nApollonius Rhodius on the same subject. It is addressed to the Emperor,\r\nand in the proëmium he pays a compliment to Domitian on his poetry, and\r\nto Titus on his victories over the Jews.\r\n\r\nHe evidently did not live to complete his original design: even the\r\neighth book is unfinished; and, from the events still remaining to be\r\nrelated, he probably planned an epic poem of the same length as that of\r\nVirgil, whose style and versification he endeavoured to imitate. An\r\nItalian poet, John Baptista Pius, continued the subject, by an addition\r\nto the eighth book, and by subjoining two more, the incidents of which\r\nwere partly borrowed from Apollonius.\r\n\r\nOf his merits Quintilian speaks favourably in the passage already\r\nalluded to, and says, that in him literature had sustained a severe\r\nloss. The severer criticism of Scaliger is more precise and more\r\njudicious:—“Immaturâ morte præreptus acerbum item poëma suum nobis\r\nreliquit. Est autem omnino duriusculus, penitus vero nudus Gratiarum\r\ncomitate.” The defects of the Argonautica are, in fact, rather of a\r\nnegative than a positive character. There are no glaring faults or\r\nblemishes; none of the affectation or rhetorical artifices which belong\r\nto the period of the decline. There may be a little occasional hardness,\r\nand a few awkward expressions and paraphrases, but there is no bombast\r\nto outrage good taste, and no unmetrical cadences to offend the ear. But\r\nthere is no genius, no inspiration, no thrilling fervour, no thoughts\r\nthat breathe or words that burn. He never rises above a dead level.\r\nEvery thing is in accordance with decent and direct propriety. He has\r\nsome talent as a descriptive poet: his versification is harmonious, and\r\nhe attains to those superficial excellencies which are found in the\r\nprize poem of a pains-taking, ingenious, and well-educated scholar.\r\nVirgil was an imitator: that is, his taste, like Roman taste,\r\nuniversally was formed and trained by imitation; but his spirit\r\ndisdained these trammels, and soared to originality. V. Flaccus is\r\nscarcely ever original except when he is commonplace: he imitates Virgil\r\nsuccessfully, as far as the outward graces of style are concerned; but\r\nin the charm of natural simplicity, he always falls short of his great\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  P. PAPINIUS STATIUS (BORN A. D. 61.)\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the first century of the Christian era,[1118]\r\nthere arrived at Rome, from Naples, a grammarian, named P. Papinius\r\nStatius. He opened a school, and soon became so celebrated as a public\r\ninstructor, that he became tutor to the young Domitian, whose favour and\r\naffection continued after he became emperor. Some of his fame was also\r\nfounded on gaining, in his boyhood, the prize in many public contests of\r\npoetry. Every year between the age of thirteen and nineteen, he is said\r\nto have been crowned. These contests were partly of an improvisatorial\r\ncharacter; and in an age when public readings and recitations were in\r\nvogue, and were the means which poets had of gaining fame and patronage,\r\nsuccess of this kind was highly valued. The subject of one of his poems\r\nis said to have been the conflagration of the Capitol, during the\r\nstruggle between the Vitellians and the supporters of Vespasian.[1119]\r\nStatius, however, seems to have possessed no higher degree of poetical\r\npower than a happy facility in versification, for he died[1120] and left\r\nno works which have stood the test of time.\r\n\r\nA son, however, inherited poetical talents of the same kind, but of a\r\nfar higher order than those of his father, and although, for a long\r\ntime, he was entirely dependent upon his works for the means of living,\r\nand, notwithstanding thunders of applause, must starve, unless he can\r\nsell his play to the manager Paris,[1121] the sunshine of imperial\r\nfavour, which his father had enjoyed, shone upon him.[1122] He purchased\r\npatronage, however, at the expense of grossly flattering the tyrant.\r\nThis son, who bore the same name as his father, was the author of the\r\nSilvæ, Thebaid, and Achilleid. He was born A. D. 61, and died in the\r\nprime of life, A. D. 95, at Naples, his native city. As no interesting\r\nparticulars are recorded respecting his life, and as he is never\r\nmentioned by any classical author except Juvenal,[1123] it is impossible\r\nto say how the opinion arose which was entertained by his admirer Dante,\r\nand others, that he was in secret a defender of the Christians, and also\r\nhimself a believer.[1124]\r\n\r\nHe was a true Italian in the character of his genius. He had a thorough\r\nperception of the beauties of nature. His Silvæ are full of truthful\r\npictures. He possessed ready facility in versification, which was\r\nsurpassed by no poet of classic antiquity except Ovid, and that\r\nimprovisatorial power for which his countrymen in the present day are so\r\noften celebrated. As long as he was content to be a poet on a small\r\nscale he was eminently successful. His Sylvæ contain many poetical\r\nincidents which might stand by themselves as perfect fugitive\r\npieces,—brief effusions, suggested by statues[1125] and buildings,[1126]\r\nverses of compliment[1127] and delicate flattery,[1128] or\r\ncondolence[1129] or congratulation. It matters not how light or trifling\r\nthe subject, he can raise it and adorn it. He writes with equal beauty\r\non the tree of his friend Atedius;[1130] the death of a parrot; of the\r\nemperor’s lion;[1131] the locks of Flavius Earinus;[1132] the rude\r\nfreedom of the Saturnalia.[1133] It is in these unpretending poems that\r\nwe see his natural and unaffected elegance, his harmonious ear, and his\r\ntruthfulness of perception. But the case is totally different when the\r\nsubject is above him.[1134] He had neither grasp of mind, nor vigour of\r\nimagination, to fit him for the task of an epic poet; and, hence, his\r\ngreat work, the Thebaid, and his other unfinished epic, the Achilleid,\r\nare complete failures.\r\n\r\nIn his minor poems he seems to trust to the natural powers of his\r\ngenius; he never strains at producing effect, nor is he too solicitous\r\nabout exact finish and laborious polish. Although not improvisatorial,\r\nthey partake of that character, and have all its freshness combined with\r\nthe advantage of written and corrected performances. His thoughts are\r\ninspired by his subject; and its reality, which he was capable of\r\nappreciating, gives a life to his compositions. But the principal fault\r\nin his Silvæ is too great a display of Greek learning. Every page is\r\nfull of mythological allusions, which sometimes render his graceful\r\nverses dry and wearisome, and must have rendered them acceptable to\r\nthose only who were well versed in Greek literature: they never could\r\nhave been universally popular. The qualities which recommended his Silvæ\r\ndo not adorn his epic poetry. His imaginary heroes do not inspire and\r\nwarm his imagination: he is not affected by their personality in the\r\nsame way in which he is by the lawns and groves, and sun, and forests,\r\nand skies of Italy.\r\n\r\nFor this deficiency he attempts to compensate by extravagant bombast,\r\ntotally out of keeping with the action of the poem, and by an attention\r\nto the theoretical principles of art, and an elaborate finish which must\r\nhave cost him many hours of toil. Yet this perseverance is thrown away,\r\nand the effect produced by the contrast between the action and essence\r\nof the poem, and the language in which it is externally clothed,\r\nproduces an effect contrary to that which was intended.\r\n\r\nHe was a skilful draughtsman, a gorgeous colourist, a pleasing\r\nlandscape-painter, and a diligent student of the rules of art; but his\r\ngenius could not rise to the highest departments of art—he could not\r\ngive the mind or the _morale_ to those characters whose external\r\nfeatures he was so apt in delineating. He owes the estimation in which\r\nhe is held as an epic poet not to his absolute but his relative merit.\r\nHe was the best of the heroic poets of his day. Statius, notwithstanding\r\nhis defects, was evidently a profound student as well as an admirer of\r\nthe Homeric poems; and there are two points in which he has proved\r\nhimself a successful imitator. These are his battles and his similes.\r\nHis descriptions of the former are stirring and dramatic, and some of\r\nhis similes will bear comparison with the best Latin specimens of this\r\nkind of illustration. When it is remembered that no epic poet has\r\napproached more nearly to Homer in the use of the simile than Dante, and\r\nthat he equals the Greek bard in sublime and picturesque description, it\r\nmay easily be imagined that these were the qualities in the poems of\r\nStatius which especially called forth his admiration.\r\n\r\nA few words only are necessary to describe the nature and subject-matter\r\nof the poems of Statius. The Silvæ consist of thirty-two separate\r\npieces. They are all hexametrical, with the exception of four in\r\nhendecasyllabics,[1135] one in Alcaic,[1136] and one in Sapphic\r\nmetre.[1137] Each of the five books in which these poems are arranged\r\nhas a prose dedication to some friend prefixed; the first being\r\naddressed to the poet Stella, the common friend of himself and\r\nMartial.[1138] The title Silvæ was given to these poems, on account of\r\nthe very quality which constitutes their especial charm. They are the\r\nrude materials of thought, springing up spontaneously in all their wild\r\nluxuriance from the rich natural soil of the poet’s imagination,\r\nunpruned, untrimmed, ignorant of that cultivated art which an affected\r\nand artificial age thought necessary to constitute a finished poem.\r\n“Such extemporaneous performances as these,” says Quintilian, “are\r\ncalled Silvæ: the author subsequently re-examines and corrects his\r\neffusions.”[1139] The Thebaid is comprised in twelve books, and its\r\nsubject is the ancient Greek legends respecting the war of the Seven\r\nagainst Thebes. The composition of this work preceded the publication of\r\nthe Silvæ. Achilleid was intended, doubtless, to embrace all the\r\nexploits of Achilles, but only two books were completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DOMITIAN.\r\n\r\nA paraphrase of the Phænomena of Aratus belongs to this age. It has been\r\nascribed to Germanicus, but its real author was Domitian, who, as well\r\nas Nero, wrote verses.[1140] As far as language and versification are\r\nconcerned, it is not without merit; but the subject is unsuitable to\r\npoetry.[1141] Domitian had taste, although his talents did not deserve\r\nthe adulatory commendations of Quintilian;[1142] but he encouraged\r\nlearned men: and to his encouragement we owe those distinguished\r\ncontemporary writers who, for one generation, arrested the downward\r\nprogress of Roman literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EPIGRAM.\r\n\r\nThe Greek Epigram was originally, as the word implies, simply an\r\ninscription. It was therefore short and concise; its metre elegiac, as\r\nespecially suited to the periodic structure of the sentiment, and its\r\ncharacteristic qualities, terseness and neatness. So long as it retained\r\nthis character it was free from bitterness; and the principal element of\r\nsuccess in this species of composition was tact rather than genius, and\r\na cultivated taste rather than poetical inspiration. Not only were\r\nCatullus, Virgil, and Ovid epigrammatists, but some Roman _literati_,\r\narrived at mediocrity, or even excellence, in epigram, who were not\r\ncapable of becoming great poets. Julius Cæsar wrote one on Terence, and\r\nperhaps the following neatly-turned lines; although they have been\r\nascribed to Augustus and Germanicus:—\r\n\r\n             Thrax puer astricto glacie dum ludit in Hebro\r\n               Pondere concretas frigore rupit aquas;\r\n             Dumque imæ partes rapido traherentur ab amne,\r\n               Abscidit tenerum lubrica testa caput.\r\n             Orba quod inventum mater dum conderet urna,\r\n               Hoc peperi flammis, cetera, dixit, aquis.\r\n\r\nLutatius Catulus was the author of a quatrain on Roscius the comedian;\r\nand the Anthology, amongst numerous others, contains one by\r\nAugustus,[1143] and four of no merit by Mæcenas,[1144] together with\r\nthose beautiful lines addressed by Hadrian to his soul, which Pope has\r\nimitated in his “Dying Christian:”—\r\n\r\n                       Animula vagula blandula,\r\n                       Hospes comesque corporis,\r\n                       Quæ nunc abibis in loca?\r\n                       Pallidula rigida nudula\r\n                       Nec ut soles dabis jocos.\r\n\r\nTo the original characteristics of epigram the Romans added that which\r\nconstitutes an epigram in the modern sense of the term, pointedness\r\neither in jest or earnest, and the bitterness of personal satire. Common\r\nsense, shrewdness, and an acute observation of human nature were thus\r\nsuperadded to Greek gracefulness and elegance; and the same nation which\r\nreduced the wild and unpremeditated sarcasms of the Greek stage into the\r\nsymmetrical form of satire, produced also the epigram as written by the\r\npen of Martial. The same characteristics of the Roman mind which mark\r\nsatire are visible also in epigram. Epigram is the concentration of\r\nsatire. The desultory vagueness which is allowable in the latter, the\r\nvariety of subjects, which are touched upon with irregular and\r\nunrestrained freedom, are, in the former, limited and defined. One idea\r\nis selected, and to this all the powers of the writer’s acute mind are\r\ndirected, and made to converge as to a point. It is not often that the\r\nharmless elements of Greek wit, such as the pun, or the pleasantry by\r\nsurprise or unexpected turn (although these sometimes occur,[1145]) are\r\nfound in the Roman epigram. Smartness is generally connected with\r\nseverity. The same bitter spirit which dictated the Archilochian epodes\r\nof Horace, which breathes throughout the indignant lines of Juvenal,\r\npoints the shafts of Martial. The blows, however, which he aimed at vice\r\ncould not be deadly, because he had no faith in virtue, and because he\r\ndelighted to grovel in the impurity which he described.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 M. VALERIUS MARTIALIS (BORN A. D. 43.)\r\n\r\nAll that is known of the life of Martial is derived from his own works;\r\nand this is but little, for he says nothing of his early years, and did\r\nnot begin to write until the reign of Domitian. Of his parents he\r\nundutifully tells us that they were fools for teaching him to\r\nread.[1146] He was born at Bilbilis, a Spanish town in the province of\r\nTarragon,[1147] of the position of which nothing is known for certain,\r\nexcept that its site was an elevated one,[1148] overlooking the river\r\nSalo, which flowed round its walls. It appears to have prided itself on\r\nits manufactures in gold and iron;[1149] to have been particularly\r\nfamous for its arms;[1150] and to have been one of the Roman colonies\r\ndignified with the title of Augusta.[1151] As Vespasian had conferred on\r\nthe poet’s native town, in common with the rest of Spain, the _jus\r\nLatii_,[1152] Martial was by birth a Roman citizen; and in the days of\r\nhis popularity obtained this privilege for many of his friends.[1153]\r\nHis birthday was March 1,[1154] A. D. 43, the third year of the reign of\r\nClaudius.\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-second year of his age, the twelfth year of the reign of\r\nNero,[1155] he migrated to Rome. He was a great favourite of Titus and\r\nDomitian, by whom the “_jus trium liberorum_” was conferred upon\r\nhim,[1156] together with the rank of a Roman knight,[1157] and the\r\nhonorary title of tribune.[1158] In the reign of the latter he was\r\nappointed to the office of court poet, and received a pension from the\r\nimperial treasury.[1159] Hence during the latter part of his residence\r\nin Rome it is almost certain that, although not rich, he enjoyed a\r\ncompetency. He had a house in the city, and a little villa at Nomentum\r\ngiven him by Domitian.[1160] Nevertheless, he is constantly complaining\r\nof his poverty, and thinks that every one grows rich but himself. He\r\nlaments that poets receive nothing but compliments for their verses,\r\nwhilst lawyers, and even common criers, gain an ample maintenance:—that\r\n“Minerva was a better patron than Apollo; a fuller stream of wealth\r\nflowed through the Forum than from the fountain of Helicon, or the\r\nchannel of Permessus.”[1161] He complains that he spends all he has, and\r\neither borrows money from his friends, or takes to another the presents\r\nhe has given him, and querulously asks him to purchase them back\r\nagain.[1162] The roof of his villa lets in the rain; and when his friend\r\nStella sends him some tiles to mend it he reproaches him for not sending\r\nalso a toga to protect the poor inmate.[1163]\r\n\r\nAll this may have proceeded from the discontented feelings which poets\r\nand literary men so often indulge at seeing genius unrewarded, and\r\naffluence attending talents which, although if not so high an order, are\r\nof more general utility. Perhaps, too, though not absolutely poor, he\r\nwas straitened in his circumstances, considering his social position and\r\nthe demands which this entailed upon him. During thirty-five years he\r\nlived at Rome the life of a flatterer, and a dependant,[1164] and then\r\nreturned to his native town.[1165] As Horace, when in his quiet country\r\nretirement, sometimes regrets the enjoyments of the capital, although\r\nwhen at Rome he sighs for the pleasures of rural life, so Martial, when\r\nat Rome, longed for Bilbilis, and when he returned to Bilbilis regretted\r\nRome. At this late period of his life he married a Spanish lady, named\r\nMarcella, whose property was amply sufficient to maintain him in\r\naffluence. Her estate he considers a little kingdom; her gardens he\r\nwould not exchange for those of Alcinous; he praises her bowers, groves,\r\nfountains, streamlets, fish-ponds, and meadows; and tells us the climate\r\nis so genial that the olive-grounds are green in January, and the roses\r\nblow twice in the year, like those of Pæstum.[1166] His wife he praises\r\nfor her rare genius and sweet manners; he tells her that no one could\r\ndiscover her provincial origin; that her equal could not be found\r\namongst the most elegant ladies in the capital; and when inclined to\r\nforget Rome she alone is all that Rome ever was to him:—\r\n\r\n             Tu desiderium dominæ mihi mitius urbis\r\n               Esse jubes; Romam tu mihi sola facis.[1167]\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding the delicate compliment which he pays to his rich\r\nwife—a compliment dictated probably more by his habit of courtly\r\nflattery than by sincerity of affection—he evidently pined for Rome. He\r\nwas fitted for crowds and not for solitude: his spirit was not pure\r\nenough to commune with itself. His delight had been so long to study the\r\nhuman heart in its worst developments, to drag forth to public view its\r\nblackest plague-spots, that he would miss the foul models which he had\r\nso long studied. Provincial life was therefore utter dulness to him; his\r\nonly enjoyment was to reproduce the results of his observations on the\r\nlife of the capital. Combining in himself the apparently inconsistent\r\ncharacters of the flatterer and the satirist, he needed great men to\r\nwhom he might look up for patronage and approbation, as well as moral\r\nwounds to probe and subjects to anatomize. Rome alone supplied these;\r\nand when he lost them he lost the intellectual food necessary for his\r\nexistence. The absence of his accustomed pursuits, and the irremediable\r\nvoid thus created, is evident in many of his epigrams.\r\n\r\nThe time of his death is uncertain, as the date of Pliny’s elegant\r\nepistle to Priscus, in which it is mentioned, cannot be\r\ndetermined.[1168] But as it is probable that the eleventh book of his\r\nEpigrams was published in the year in which he left Rome for Bilbilis,\r\nand as he apologizes in the dedication of his twelfth book to Priscus\r\nfor his obstinate indolence during a period of three years, his death\r\ncannot have taken place before A. D. 104. It is, however, generally\r\nsupposed that his life was not prolonged much beyond this date. His\r\ndeath may have been hastened by his distaste for a provincial life, and\r\nby the malice and envy of his new neighbours.[1169]\r\n\r\nAccording to his own account, in an epigram,[1170] in which he contrasts\r\nhimself with an effeminate fop, his appearance was rough and unpolished,\r\nhis shaggy hair refused to curl, his cheeks were well-whiskered, and his\r\nvoice was louder than the roar of a lioness.[1171] It is impossible to\r\nbelieve the assertion which he makes respecting his own moral character,\r\nnamely, that although his verses are licentious his life was virtuous,\r\n\r\n            Lasciva est nobis pagina, vita proba est.[1172]\r\n\r\n—although, measured by the corrupt standard of morals which disgraced\r\nthe age in which he lived, he was probably not worse than most of his\r\ncontemporaries. The fearful profligacy which his powerful pen describes\r\nin such hideous terms spread through Rome its loathsome infection. As no\r\nlanguage is strong enough to denounce the impurities of his\r\nage—impurities, in the description of which, the poet evidently revels\r\nwith a cynical delight—so they were not merely creatures of a prurient\r\nimagination, but had a real existence.\r\n\r\nIt may be said in extenuation of his crime, that the prevalence of vice\r\nproduced the obscenity of the poet; but no more can be said in defence\r\nof works in which the characters of vice are emblazoned in such\r\nshameless and unnatural deformity. Had he lived in better times, his\r\ntalents, of which no doubt can be entertained, might have been devoted\r\nto a purer object; as it was, his moral taste must have been thoroughly\r\ndepraved not to have turned with loathing and disgust from the\r\ncontemplation of such subjects, instead of voluntarily seeking them; for\r\n“out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” In Martial we\r\nobserve that paradoxical but still not unusual combination of varied\r\nwit, poetical imagination, and a happy power of graceful expression, not\r\nonly with strong sensual passions, but with a delight in vice in its\r\nmost hateful forms and attributes.\r\n\r\nAlthough the new feature which Martial added to the Greek epigram is\r\nsuch as has been described, and although his pages are polluted and\r\ndefiled, not all his poems are spiteful or obscene. Amidst some\r\nobscurity of style and want of finish, many are redolent of Greek\r\nsweetness and elegance. Here and there are pleasing descriptions of the\r\nbeauties of nature;[1173] and, setting aside those which are evidently\r\ndictated by the spirit of flattery, many are kind-hearted, as well as\r\ncomplimentary. The few lines which were intended to accompany such\r\ntrifling offerings of friendship as the poet could afford to give, and\r\nwhich, doubtless, rendered a flower or a toy doubly acceptable, are\r\nequal in neatness to many of the Greek Anthology. When he sends a rose\r\nto Apollinaris, it is accompanied by the following elegant lines:—\r\n\r\n                I felix rosa, mollibusque sertis\r\n                Nostri cinge comas Apollinaris;\r\n                Quas tu nectere candidas sed olim,\r\n                Sic te semper amet Venus, memento.[1174]\r\n\r\n  Go, happy rose, and with thy delicate garlands wreathe the locks of my\r\n  Apollinaris; and remember, so may Venus ever love thee! to entwine\r\n  them when gray: but may it be long ere that time comes.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth book contains numerous ingenious couplets, sent, together\r\nwith pencases, dice, tablets, toothpicks, and other little presents, at\r\nthe Saturnalian festival.\r\n\r\nIn so vast a collection of pieces it is natural to expect that there\r\nwould be great inequality, and that some of his wit would be commonplace\r\nand puerile. That such was the case, he himself confesses more than\r\nonce;[1175] and in one place he states that this inequality constitutes\r\none of the merits of his work.[1176]\r\n\r\nHe knew that his works were appreciated, not only at Rome, but also\r\nthroughout the empire:—\r\n\r\n                  Toto notus in orbe Martialis\r\n                  Argutis epigrammaton libellis;[1177]\r\n\r\nand this consciousness is some excuse for the vanity which occasionally\r\nshows itself,[1178] and which does not hesitate to account blemishes as\r\nbeauties.\r\n\r\nThe following are favourable specimens of his poetry:—\r\n\r\n  Indignas premeret pestis cum tabida fauces,\r\n    Inque ipsos vultus serperet atra lues;\r\n  Siccis ipse genis flentes hortatus amicos\r\n    Decrevit Stygios Festus adire lacus.\r\n  Nec tamen obscuro pia polluit ora veneno,\r\n    Aut torsit lenta tristia fata fame;\r\n  Sanctam Romana vitam sed morte peregit,\r\n    Dimisitque animam nobiliore via.\r\n  Hanc mortem fatis magni præferre Catonis\r\n    Fama potest; hujus Cæsar amicus erat.\r\n\r\n  When the dire quinsey choked his noble breath,\r\n    And o’er his face the blackening venom stole,\r\n  Festus disdained to wait a lingering death,\r\n    Cheered his sad friends, and freed his dauntless soul.\r\n  Nor meager famine’s slowly-wasting force,\r\n    Nor hemlock’s gradual chillness he endured;\r\n  But closed his life a truly Roman course,\r\n    And with one blow his liberty secured.\r\n  The Fates gave Cato a less glorious end,\r\n    For Cæsar was his foe, Festus was Cæsar’s friend.[1179]\r\n                                                           _Hodgson._\r\n\r\n  Casta suo gladium cum traderet Arria Pæto\r\n    Quem de visceribus traxerat ipsa suis,\r\n  Si qua fides, vulnus, quod feci, non dolet, inquit;\r\n    Sed quod tu facies, hoc mihi, Pæte, dolet.\r\n\r\n  When Arria to her Pætus gave the steel,\r\n    Which from her bleeding side did newly part;\r\n  “From my own stroke,” she said, “no pain I feel,\r\n    But, ah! thy wound will stab me to the heart.”\r\n\r\n  Dum nos blanda tenent jucundi stagna Lucrini\r\n    Et quæ pumiceis fontibus antra calent,\r\n  Tu colis Argivi regnum Faustine coloni\r\n    Quo te bis decimus ducit ab urbe lapis.\r\n  Horrida sed fervent Nemeæi pectora monstri\r\n    Nec satis est Baias igne calere suo.\r\n  Ergo sacri fontes et littora sacra valete\r\n    Nympharum pariter Nereidumque domus!\r\n  Herculeos colles gelida vos vincite bruma,\r\n    Nunc Tiburtinis cedite frigoribus.\r\n\r\n  While near the Lucrine lake, consumed to death,\r\n  I draw the sultry air and gasp for breath,\r\n  Where streams of sulphur raise a stifling heat,\r\n  And thro’ the pores of the warm pumice sweat;\r\n  You taste the cooling breeze where, nearer home,\r\n  The twentieth pillar marks the mile from Rome.\r\n  And now the Sun to the bright Lion turns,\r\n  And Baia with redoubled fury burns;\r\n  Then briny seas and tasteful springs, farewell,\r\n  Where fountain Nymphs confused with Naiads dwell.\r\n  In winter you may all the world despise,\r\n  But now ’tis Tivoli that bears the prize.\r\n                                                           _Addison._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n AUFIDIUS BASSUS AND CREMUTIUS CORDUS—VELLEIUS PATERCULUS—CHARACTER OF\r\nHIS WORKS—VALERIUS MAXIMUS—CORNELIUS TACITUS—AGE OF TRAJAN—BIOGRAPHY OF\r\n                        TACITUS—HIS EXTANT WORKS\r\n    ENUMERATED—AGRICOLA—GERMANY—HISTORIES—TRADITIONS RESPECTING THE\r\n         JEWS—ANNALS—OBJECT OF TACITUS—HIS CHARACTER—HIS STYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest prose writers belonging to this epoch were Aufidius Bassus\r\nand Cremutius Cordus. The former wrote a history of the German and civil\r\nwars, which was continued by the elder Pliny; of the latter only a few\r\nfragments have been preserved by Seneca.[1180] They were published in\r\nthe reign of Tiberius; and it is evident that they contained a history\r\nof the civil wars, for his praise of Brutus and Cassius was made the\r\npretext for his impeachment. It is also clear that he treated of\r\ncontemporary events; for the real cause of the emperor’s hostility was\r\nan attack which he made upon the favourite Sejanus. In vain he tendered\r\nan apology; and seeing there was no hope of escape he starved himself to\r\ndeath.[1181] His histories were publicly burned, but his daughter, to\r\nwhom Seneca addressed his “_Consolatio_,” concealed some copies, and\r\nafterwards published them, with the approbation of Caligula.[1182]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        M. VELLEIUS PATERCULUS.\r\n\r\nTogether with these flourished M. Velleius Paterculus. He was a soldier\r\nof equestrian family, served his first campaign in Asia, and\r\nsubsequently, after passing through the various steps of promotion,\r\nacted as _legatus_ to Tiberius in Germany. His services recommended him\r\nto the favour of the prince, on whose accession he was made prætor, and\r\nproved himself a stanch supporter of him and his favourite minister\r\nSejanus. In the fall of that unworthy man,[1183] Paterculus was\r\ninvolved, and was most probably put to death.\r\n\r\nThe short historical work by which he is known as an author is a history\r\nof Rome, and of the nations connected with the foundation of the\r\nimperial city, in two books. It is dedicated to M. Vinucius, consul; and\r\nas it carries on the history to the death of Livia, the mother of\r\nTiberius, in the year of his consulate,[1184] it must have been\r\nfinished, perhaps almost entirely written within that year. Assuming\r\nthat it was wise to undertake the task of comprising within such narrow\r\nlimits events extending over so large a field, it is not unskilfully\r\nperformed. The most striking events are selected and told in a lively\r\nand interesting manner; but he had one fault fatal to his character as\r\nan historian, who professed to treat of his own times. He is partial,\r\nprejudiced, and adulatory. He had not courage to be a Thucydides or a\r\nSallust. The perilous nature of the times, and the personal obligations\r\nunder which he was to the emperor, made him a courtier, and from this\r\none-sided point of view he viewed contemporary history.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, a man of lively talents though of superficial\r\neducation: his taste was formed after the model of the Augustan writers,\r\nespecially Sallust, of whose style, so far as the outward form, he was\r\nan imitator. But although he was one of the earliest writers of the so\r\ncalled silver age, his language shows signs of degeneracy. It is, at\r\ntimes, overstrained and unnatural; there is the usual affectation of\r\nrhetorical effect, and an unnecessary use of uncommon words and\r\nconstructions; still, whenever he keeps his model in view, he is\r\nscarcely inferior to him in conciseness and perspicuity. The first book\r\nof his history is in a very imperfect state; in fact, the commencement\r\nis entirely lost. Only one manuscript of it has been discovered, and\r\neven this is now nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           VALERIUS MAXIMUS.\r\n\r\nValerius Maximus can scarcely be termed an historian, although the\r\nsubject of which he treated is historical. His work is neither one of\r\noriginal research, nor is it a connected abridgment of the investigation\r\nof his predecessors. It is a collection of anecdotes, entitled _Dictorum\r\nFactorumque Memorabilium_, Libri IX. His object is a moral one; namely,\r\nto illustrate, by examples, the beauty of virtue and the deformity of\r\nvice; but he is influenced in the selection less by historical truth\r\nthan by the striking and interesting character of the narrative. The\r\narrangement of the anecdotes resembles that of a commonplace book,\r\nrather than of history, the only principle observed being, that\r\nanecdotes of Romans and foreigners are kept distinct from one another.\r\n\r\nNothing is known, for certain, respecting his personal history. He\r\nhimself states[1185] that he accompanied Sextus Pompeius into Asia; and,\r\nfrom a comparison of different passages, it is probable that, like\r\nVelleius Paterculus, he flourished and wrote during the reign of\r\nTiberius. His style is prolix and declamatory, and characterized by\r\nawkward affectation and involved obscurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         C. CORNELIUS TACITUS.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons already stated, Rome, for a long period, could boast of\r\nno historian; but, under the genial and fostering influence of the\r\nEmperor Trajan,[1186] not only the fine arts, especially architecture,\r\nflourished, but also literature revived. The choice of Nerva could not\r\nhave fallen on a better successor to his short reign. He was a Spaniard,\r\nbut his native town was a flourishing Roman colony: the whole country\r\nround about it had experienced the effects of Roman civilization, and\r\nthe language of all the towns in the south of Spain was Latin. The\r\nglories of war and the duties of peace divided his attention. By the\r\nformer, he gave employment to his vast armies; by the latter he refined\r\nthe tastes and improved the character of his people. No better testimony\r\ncan be desired than the correspondence between him and Pliny to the\r\nmildness and wisdom of his domestic and foreign administration. The\r\ninfluence, also, of his empress, Plotina, and his sister, Marciana,\r\nexercised a beneficial influence upon Roman society; for they were the\r\nfirst ladies of the imperial court who by their example checked the\r\nshameless licentiousness which had long prevailed amongst women of the\r\nhigher classes. The same taste and execution which are visible in the\r\nbas-reliefs on the column of Trajan adorn the literature of his age, as\r\nillustrated by its two great lights, Tacitus and the younger Pliny.\r\nThere is not the rich, graceful ornament which invests with such a charm\r\nthe writers of the golden age; but the absence of these qualities is\r\namply compensated by dignity, gravity, honesty and truthfulness. There\r\nis a solidity in the style of Tacitus which makes amends for its\r\ndifficulty, and justifies the intense admiration with which he was\r\nregarded by Pliny. Truthfulness beams throughout the writings of these\r\ntwo great contemporaries; and incorruptible virtue is as visible in the\r\npages of Tacitus as benevolence is in the letters of Pliny. They\r\nmutually influenced each other’s character and principles: their tastes\r\nand pursuits were similar: they loved each other dearly; corresponded\r\nregularly, corrected each other’s works, and accepted patiently and\r\ngratefully each other’s criticisms. If, however, on all occasions, their\r\nobservations were such as appear in the letters of Pliny, it is probable\r\nthat their mutual regard, and the unbounded admiration which Pliny\r\nentertained for the superior genius of his friend caused them to be\r\nrather laudatory than severe.\r\n\r\nThe exact date of the birth of Tacitus is not known; but from one of the\r\nmany letters extant, addressed to him by Pliny,[1187] it may be inferred\r\nthat the former was not more than one or two years senior to his friend.\r\nIn it he reminds him that in years they are almost equals, and adds that\r\nhe himself was a young man when Tacitus had already obtained a brilliant\r\nreputation. There is a tradition which assigns the birth of Tacitus to\r\nthe year of Nero’s accession; but as Pliny the Younger was born A. D.\r\n61, and Nero assumed the imperial purple A. D. 54, this date would make\r\nthe difference in age between him and Pliny too great to be consistent\r\nwith the expressions of the latter. Tacitus was of equestrian rank, and\r\nwas procurator of Belgic Gaul in the reigns of Vespasian and Titus, from\r\nwhom, as well as from Domitian, he received many marks of esteem. In\r\nA. D. 78, he married the daughter of C. Julius Agricola. He was one of\r\nthe fifteen commissioners appointed for the celebration of the Ludi\r\nSeculares, A. D. 88, and was also prætor the same year. In A. D. 97, he\r\nserved the office of consul. To this magistracy he was elected in order\r\nto supply the place of Virginius Rufus, who had died during his year of\r\noffice, and over him Tacitus pronounced the funeral oration. In A. D.\r\n99, he was associated by the Senate with Pliny[1188] in the impeachment\r\nof Marius Priscus, proconsul of Africa, for maladministration of his\r\nprovince; and his friend Pliny praises his reply to the acute subtleties\r\nof Salvius Liberalis, the advocate of Marius, as distinguished, not only\r\nfor oratorical power, but for that which he considers the most\r\nremarkable quality of his style, _gravity_. His words are, “Respondit\r\nCorn. Tacitus eloquentissime et quod eximie orationi ejus inest,\r\nσεμνως.”[1189] It is not known when Tacitus died, nor whether he left\r\nany descendants; but there can be no doubt that he survived the\r\naccession of Hadrian.[1190]\r\n\r\nThe works of Tacitus which are extant, are:—(1.) A Life of his\r\nfather-in-law, Agricola. (2.) A tract on the Manners and Nations of\r\nGermany. (3.) A small portion of a voluminous work, entitled Histories.\r\n(4.) About two-thirds of another historical work, entitled Annals. (5.)\r\nA dialogue on the Decline of Eloquence is also ascribed to him; and\r\nalthough doubts have been entertained of its genuineness, they do not\r\nrest upon any strong foundation. It is impossible to do more than\r\napproximate to the dates at which each work of Tacitus was composed. The\r\nimminent peril of writing or speaking plainly on events or individuals\r\nrenders it almost certain that none of them could have been published\r\nbefore the accession of Trajan. Niebuhr[1191] entertains no doubt that\r\nthe first edition of the Life of Agricola was published towards the end\r\nof Domitian’s reign, and that, subsequently, it was revised and an\r\nintroduction prefixed. But is it not more probable that, although the\r\nwork was then written, it was not published until after revision?\r\n\r\nGreat as were the moral worth and the amiable gentleness of Agricola,\r\nhis courage as a soldier, his skill and decision as a general, his\r\nprudence and caution as a politician, and, therefore, however deserving\r\nhe may be of the pleasing light in which his character is portrayed,\r\nstill the life of Tacitus is a panegyric rather than a biography. The\r\nnear relation in which Tacitus stood to him, the affectionate admiration\r\nwhich Agricola must necessarily have commanded from one who knew him so\r\nwell, unfitted him for the work of an impartial biographer. The fine\r\npoints of Agricola’s character outshine all its other features; but we\r\ncannot suppose that he had no defects, no weaknesses. These, however, do\r\nnot appear in the little work of Tacitus. His son-in-law either could\r\nnot or would not see them. Still the brief sketch is a beautiful\r\nspecimen of the vigour and force of expression with which this greatest\r\npainter of antiquity could throw off any portrait which he attempted.\r\nEven if the likeness be somewhat flattered, the qualities which the\r\nwriter possessed, his insight into character, his pathetic power, and\r\nhis affectionate heart, render this short piece one of the most\r\nattractive biographies extant.[1192]\r\n\r\nWith what simple pathos does he tell us of the obligation which\r\nAgricola, like so many other great men, owed to the educating care of\r\nhis pure-minded, prudent, and indulgent mother, and the gratitude with\r\nwhich he was wont constantly to speak of that obligation! With what\r\naffection does he speak of one bound to him, not only by the ties of\r\naffinity, but by the stronger ties of a congenial temper and\r\ndisposition! In his reflections on his death, there is no affected\r\nattempt at dramatic display. The few words devoted to so mournful a\r\nsubject simply breathe the overwhelming sense of bereavement, unassuaged\r\nby the consolation of being present at his last moments. “Happy wert\r\nthou, Agricola, not only because thy life was glorious, but because thy\r\ndeath was well-timed! All who heard thy last words bear witness to the\r\nconstancy with which thou didst welcome death as though thou wert\r\ndetermined manfully to acquit the emperor of being the cause. But the\r\nbitterness of thy daughter’s sorrow and mine for the loss of a parent is\r\nenhanced by the reflection, that it did not fall to our lot to watch\r\nover thy declining health, to solace thy failing strength, to enjoy thy\r\nlast looks, thy last embraces. Faithfully would we have listened to thy\r\nparting words and wishes, and imprinted them deeply on our memories.\r\nThis was our chief sorrow, our most painful wound. Owing to our long\r\nabsence from Rome, thou hadst been lost to us four years before.\r\nDoubtless, O best of parents! enough, and more than enough, of honour\r\nwas paid to thee by the assiduous attention of thy affectionate wife;\r\nstill the last offices were paid thee amidst too few tears, and thine\r\neyes were conscious that some loved object was absent just as their\r\nlight was dimmed for ever.” To this tribute of dutiful affection,\r\nsucceed sentiments of noble resignation, joined with an humble\r\nconviction of the transitory nature of human talents, and an earnest\r\nlooking-for of immortality. To us, the biography of Agricola is\r\nespecially interesting, because Britain was the scene of his glory as a\r\nmilitary commander, and of his success in civil administration. His army\r\nfirst penetrated beyond the Friths of Forth and Clyde into the Highlands\r\nof Scotland, and his fleet first circumnavigated the northern\r\nextremities of the British island.\r\n\r\nThe treatise on the geography, manners and nations of Germany (_De Situ\r\nMoribus et Populus Germaniæ_) is but little longer than the Life of\r\nAgricola. The information contained in it is exactly of that character\r\nwhich might be expected, considering the sources from which it was\r\nderived. Tacitus was never in Germany, and therefore his knowledge was\r\ncollected from those who had visited it for the purposes either of war\r\nor commerce. Hence his geographical descriptions are often vague and\r\ninaccurate; a mixture of the marvellous shows that some of his\r\nnarratives consist in mere travellers’ tales, whilst the salient points\r\nand characteristic features of the national manners bear the impress of\r\ntruth, and are supported by the well-known habits and institutions of\r\nTeutonic nations.\r\n\r\nHe tells of their bards, and explains the etymology of the term by the\r\nword Barditum, which signified the recitation of their songs.[1193] He\r\nhints at wild legends and dark superstitions with which the German\r\nimagination still loves to people the dark recesses of their\r\nforests.[1194] He describes their pure and unmixed race, and,\r\nconsequently, the universal prevalence of the national features—blue\r\neyes, red or sandy hair, and stalwart and gigantic frames.[1195]\r\nAccording to his account, their political constitutions were elective\r\nmonarchies, but the monarch was always of noble birth and his power\r\nlimited;[1196] and all matters of importance were debated by the estate\r\nof the people.[1197] In the solemn permission accorded to a German youth\r\nto bear arms, and his investiture with lance and shield, is seen the\r\norigin of knighthood;[1198] and in the sanctity of the marriage-tie, the\r\nchastity of the female sex, their social influence, and the respect paid\r\nto them—the rarity of adultery and its severe punishment, and the total\r\nabsence of polygamy—we recognise the germ of the distinguishing\r\ncharacteristics of chivalry.[1199] They were hospitable and constant to\r\ntheir hereditary friendships, but stern in perpetuating family\r\nfeuds;[1200] passionately fond of gambling, and strict in their regard\r\nfor debts of honour;[1201] inveterate drinkers, and their favourite\r\npotation was beer;[1202] they could not consult on important matters\r\nwithout a convivial meeting;[1203] if they quarrelled over their cups,\r\nthey had recourse rarely to words, usually to blows.[1204] Their slaves\r\nwere in the condition of serfs or villains, and paid to the lord a fixed\r\nrent in corn, or cattle, or manufactures.[1205] They reckoned their time\r\nby nights instead of days,[1206] just as we are accustomed to use the\r\nexpressions se’nnight and fortnight.\r\n\r\nAfter having sketched the manners and customs of the nation as a whole\r\nhe proceeds to treat of each tribe separately.[1207] In speaking of our\r\nforefathers, the _Angli_, who inhabited part of the modern territory of\r\nSleswick Holstein, and whose name is still retained in the district of\r\nAngeln, one word which he uses is an English one. The Angli, he says,\r\ntogether with the conterminous tribes, worship Herthus, _i. e._\r\nTerra.[1208] Even in these early times he mentions the naval superiority\r\nof the Suiones, who were the ancestors of the Normans and Sea-kings.\r\nWith these he affirms that the continent of Europe terminates, and all\r\nbeyond is a motionless and frozen ocean.[1209] Truth in these distant\r\nclimes mingles with fable. Daylight continues after the sun has set, but\r\na hissing noise is heard as his blazing orb plunges into the sea, and\r\nthe forms of the gods, and the radiant glories which surround their\r\nheads, are visible.[1210] The list of marvels ends with fabulous beings,\r\nwhose bodies and limbs are those of wild beasts, whilst their heads and\r\nfaces are human.\r\n\r\nThe earliest historical work of Tacitus is his “_Historiæ_,” of which\r\nonly four books and a portion of the fifth are extant. Their contents\r\nextend from the second consulship of Galba[1211] to the commencement of\r\nthe siege of Jerusalem. The original work concluded with the death of\r\nDomitian.[1212] He purposed also, if his life had been spared, to add\r\nthe reigns of Nerva and Trajan, as the employment of his old age. “The\r\nmaterials for which,” he says, “are more plentiful and trustworthy,\r\nbecause of the unusual felicity of an age in which men were allowed to\r\nthink as they pleased, and to give utterance to what they\r\nthought.”[1213] It is plain from the word Divus (the deified) being\r\nprefixed to the name of Nerva, and not to that of Trajan, in the passage\r\nabove quoted, that this work was written after Trajan had put on the\r\nimperial purple.[1214]\r\n\r\nAccording to St. Jerome it originally consisted of thirty books; and the\r\nminuteness with which each event is recorded in the portion extant\r\nrenders it highly probable that the original work was as extensive as\r\nthis assertion would imply. The object which he proposed to himself was\r\nworthy of his penetrating mind, from the searching gaze of which even\r\nthe hypocrisy and dissimulation of a Tiberius were powerless to veil the\r\nfoul darkness of his crafty nature. He intended “to investigate the\r\npolitical state of the commonwealth, the feelings of its armies, the\r\nsentiments of the provinces, the elements of its strength and weakness,\r\nthe causes and reasons for each phænomenon.”[1215] The principal fault\r\nwhich diminishes the value of his history as a record of events, is his\r\ntoo great readiness to accept evidence unhesitatingly, and to record\r\npopular rumours without taking sufficient pains to examine into their\r\ntruth. Still these blots are but few, scattered over a vast field of\r\nfaithful history. Perhaps the most lamentable instance is presented in\r\nhis incorrect account of the history, constitution, and manners of the\r\nJewish people. Wanting either the opportunity or the inclination to\r\nconsult the sacred books of the nation, he mixes up vague traditions of\r\ntheir early history with the fables of Pagan mythology; and, like the\r\nGreeks and Romans, gives names to imaginary patriarchs, taken from\r\nlocalities connected with their history.\r\n\r\nAccording to his account the Jews originally inhabited Crete,[1216] and\r\nfrom Mount Ida, in that Island, received the name of Idæi, which\r\nafterwards became corrupted into Judæi. From Crete, when Saturn was\r\nexpelled by Jove, they took refuge in Egypt; and thence under two\r\nleaders, Juda and Hierosolymus, again migrated to the neighbouring\r\ncountry of Palestine. A second tradition attributes to them an Assyrian\r\norigin; a third an Æthiopian; a fourth asserts that they were descended\r\nfrom the Solymi which Homer celebrated in his poems.[1217]\r\n\r\nThe next tradition which he mentions approaches nearer to the true one.\r\nEgypt being afflicted with a plague, the king Bocchoris, by the advice\r\nof the oracle of Ammon, purged his kingdom of them, and under the\r\nguidance of Moses they began their wanderings. When they were dying on\r\ntheir way for want of water, their leader followed a herd of wild asses,\r\nby which he was led to a copious well of water. Thus was their drought\r\nrelieved; and, after journeying six days, they obtained possession of\r\nthe land in which they built their capital and temple. Moses introduced\r\nnew religious rites contrary to those of other nations. He set up the\r\nimage of an ass in the Holy of Holies—a statement which afterwards\r\nTacitus virtually contradicts by saying that they allow no images in\r\ntheir temples,[1218] that they preferred taking up arms to admitting the\r\nstatue of Caligula into the temple;[1219] and that when Pompey took\r\nJerusalem,[1220] he found no image of any deity, and the sanctuary\r\nempty. He adds, that they sacrifice rams in order to show contempt to\r\nJupiter Ammon, and oxen, because, under that form, Apis was worshipped\r\nby the Egyptians; that they abstain from pork in remembrance of their\r\nhaving been afflicted with leprosy, to which that animal is subject, and\r\neat unleavened bread as a memorial of their once having stolen food. On\r\nthe seventh day, which terminated their wanderings, they do no work, and\r\nin like manner the seventh year they devote to idleness. This Sabbath,\r\nsome assert that they keep holy in honour of Saturn. They believe in the\r\nimmortality of the soul, and in future rewards and punishments, and\r\nembalm their dead like the Egyptians. Such are the various traditions\r\nrespecting the Jews which Tacitus incorporates in his Histories.\r\n\r\nThe Annals, which were written subsequently to the Histories, were so\r\ncalled, because each historical event is recorded in historical order\r\nunder the year to which it belongs.[1221] They consist of sixteen books;\r\ncommence with the death of Augustus,[1222] and conclude with that of\r\nNero.[1223] The only portions extant are—the first four books, part of\r\nthe fifth, the sixth, part of the eleventh, the twelfth, thirteenth,\r\nfourteenth, fifteenth, and the commencement of the sixteenth book. The\r\nAnnals are rather histories of each successive emperor than of the Roman\r\npeople; but this is the necessary condition of narrating the fortunes of\r\na nation which now possessed only the bare name, and not the reality of\r\nconstitutional government. The state was now the emperor; the end and\r\nobject of the social system his security; and every political event must\r\ntherefore be treated in relation to him.\r\n\r\nBut a history of this kind in the hands of one who had such skill in\r\ndiving into the recesses of man’s heart, who could read so shrewdly and\r\ndelineate so vigorously human character, who possessed as a writer such\r\npicturesque and dramatic power, becomes the more interesting from its\r\nbiographical nature, and its philosophical importance as a moral rather\r\nthan a political study. It is not, owing to circumstances over which the\r\nauthor had no control, the history of a great nation, for the Romans, as\r\na whole, were no longer great. Neither does it paint the rise, progress\r\nand development of constitutional freedom, for it had reached its\r\nzenith, had declined, become paralyzed, and finally extinct. But still\r\nthere existed bright examples of heroism, and courage, and\r\nself-devotion, truly Roman, and instances not less prominent of\r\ncorruption and degradation. Individuals stand out in bold relief,\r\neminent for the noblest virtues or blackened by the basest crimes. These\r\nappear either singly or in groups upon the stage: the emperor forms the\r\nprincipal figure; and the moral sense of the reader is awakened to\r\nadmire instances of patient suffering and determined bravery, or abject\r\nslavery and remorseless despotism.\r\n\r\nThe object of Tacitus, therefore, was not, like that of the great\r\nphilosophical historian of Greece, to describe the growth of political\r\ninstitutions, or the implacable animosities which raged between opposite\r\npolitical principles—the struggles for supremacy between a class and a\r\nwhole people—but the influence which the establishment of tyranny on the\r\nruins of liberty exercised for good or for evil in bringing out the\r\ncharacter of the individual. Rome, the imperial city, was the\r\nall-engrossing subject of his predecessors; Romans were but subordinate\r\nand accessary. Tacitus delineated the lives and deaths of individuals,\r\nand showed the relation which they bore to the fortunes of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt would have been impossible to have satisfied a people whose taste had\r\nbecome more than ever rhetorical, without the introduction of orations.\r\nThose of Tacitus are perfect specimens of art; and probably, with the\r\nexception of Galgacus,[1224] far more true than those of other Roman\r\nhistorians. Still he made use of them, not only to imbody traditional\r\naccounts of what had really been said on each occasion, but to\r\nillustrate his own views of the character of the speaker, and to convey\r\nhis own political opinions.\r\n\r\nFull of sagacious observation and descriptive power, Tacitus engages the\r\nmost serious attention of the reader by the gravity of his condensed and\r\ncomprehensive style, as he does by the wisdom and dignity of his\r\nreflections. The purity and gravity of his sentiments remind the reader\r\neven of Christian authors.\r\n\r\nLiving amidst the influences of a corrupt age he was uncontaminated; and\r\nby his virtue and integrity, his chastened political liberality,\r\ncommands our admiration as a man, whilst his love of truth is reflected\r\nin his character as an historian. Although he imitated, as well as\r\napproved, the cautious policy of his father-in-law, he was not destitute\r\nof moral firmness.\r\n\r\nIt derogates nothing from his courage that he was silent during the\r\nperilous times in which great part of his life was passed, and spoke\r\nwith boldness only when the happy reign of Nerva had commenced, and the\r\nbroken spirit of the nation had revived. Like the rest of his\r\nfellow-countrymen he exhibited a remarkable example of patient\r\nendurance, when the imperial jealousy made even the praise of those who\r\nwere obnoxious to the tyrant treason; when it was considered a capital\r\ncrime for Arulenus Rusticus to praise Pætus Thrasea, and Herennius\r\nSenecio to eulogize Priscus Helvidius.\r\n\r\nIn those fearful times he himself says, that “as old Rome had witnessed\r\nthe greatest glories of liberty, so her descendants had been cast down\r\nto the lowest depths of slavery; and would have been deprived of the use\r\nof memory, as well as of language, if it were equally in man’s power to\r\nforget as to be silent.”[1225] In such times prudence was a duty, and\r\ndaring courage would have been unavailing rashness. In his praise of\r\nAgricola, and his blame of Pætus, he enunciates the principles which\r\nregulate his own conduct—that to endanger yourself without the slightest\r\nprospect of benefiting your country is mere ostentatious ambition.\r\n“Sciant,” he writes, “quibus moris illicita mirari, posse etiam sub\r\nmalis principibus magnos viros esse; obsequiumque ac modestiam, si\r\nindustria ac vigor adsint, eo laudis excedere quo plerique per abrupta,\r\nsed in nullum reipublicæ usum ambitiosa morte inclaruerunt.”[1226]\r\nAgain, “Thrasea Pætus sibi causam periculi fecit, cæteris libertatis\r\ninitium non præbuit.”[1227]\r\n\r\nIn the style of Tacitus the form is always subordinate to the matter;\r\nthe ideas maintain their due supremacy over the language in which they\r\nare conveyed. There is none of that striving after epigrammatic\r\nterseness which savours of affectation. His brevity, like that which\r\ncharacterizes the style of Thucydides, is the necessary condensation of\r\na writer whose thoughts flow more quickly than his pen can express them.\r\nHence his sentences are suggestive of far more than they express: they\r\nare enigmatical hints of deep and hidden meaning, which keep the mind\r\nactive and the attention alive, and delight the reader with the\r\npleasures of discovery and the consciousness of difficulties overcome.\r\nNor is this natural and unintentional brevity unsuitable to the cautious\r\nreserve with which all were tutored to speak and think of political\r\nsubjects in perilous times. It is extraordinary how often a similarity\r\nbetween his mind and that of Thucydides inadvertently discovers\r\nitself—not only in his mode of thinking, but also in his language, even\r\nin his grammatical constructions, especially in his frequent\r\nsubstitution of attraction for government, in instances of condensed\r\nconstruction, and in the connexion of clauses grammatically different,\r\nalthough they are metaphysically the same.\r\n\r\nNor is his brevity dry or harsh—it is enlivened by copiousness, variety,\r\nand poetry. He scarcely ever repeats the same idea in the same form. No\r\nauthor is richer in synonymous words, or arranges with more varied skill\r\nthe position of words in a sentence. As for poetic genius, his language\r\nis highly figurative; no prose writer deals more largely in prosopopœia:\r\nhis descriptions of scenery and incidents are eminently picturesque; his\r\ncharacters dramatic; the expression of his own sentiments and feelings\r\nas subjective as lyric poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\nC. SUETONIUS TRANQUILLUS—HIS BIOGRAPHY—SOURCES OF HIS HISTORY—HIS GREAT\r\nFAULT—Q. CURTIUS RUFUS—TIME WHEN HE FLOURISHED DOUBTFUL—HIS BIOGRAPHY OF\r\n ALEXANDER—EPITOMES OF L. ANNÆUS FLORUS—SOURCES WHENCE HE DERIVED THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       C. SUETONIUS TRANQUILLUS.\r\n\r\nC. Suetonius Tranquillus[1228] was the son of Suetonius Lenis, who\r\nserved as tribunus angusticlavus of the thirteenth legion at the battle\r\nof Bedriacum, in which the Emperor Otho was defeated by Vitellius. The\r\ntime of his birth is uncertain; but from a passage at the end of his\r\nLife of Nero[1229] it may be inferred that he was born very soon after\r\nthe death of that emperor, which took place A. D. 68; for in it he\r\nmentions that, when twenty years subsequent to Nero’s death, a false\r\nNero appeared, he was just arriving at manhood (_adolescens_.) The\r\nknowledge of language and rhetorical taste displayed in the remains of\r\nhis works on these subjects prove that he was well instructed in these\r\nbranches of a Roman liberal education: and a letter of the younger\r\nPliny,[1230] whose intimate friend he was, speaks of him as an advocate\r\nby profession. This letter represents him as unwilling to plead a cause,\r\nwhich he had undertaken, because he was frightened by a dream. It is\r\nprobable that this anecdote is an authentic one, because so many\r\nexamples occur in his memoirs of his superstitious belief in dreams,\r\nomens, ghosts, and prodigies.[1231]\r\n\r\nThe affectionate regard which Pliny entertained for his friend was very\r\ngreat, and led him to form too high an estimate of his talents as a\r\nwriter and an historian. On one occasion he used his influence at court\r\nto get him a tribuneship; which, however, he did not accept.[1232] On\r\nanother he obtained for him, from Trajan,[1233] the “_jus trium\r\nliberorum_,” although he had no children. But this privilege, as in the\r\ncase of Martial, was sometimes granted under similar circumstances. In\r\nthis letter, which he wrote to the Emperor, he speaks of Suetonius as a\r\nman of the greatest probity, integrity, and learning; and adds that,\r\nafter the experience of a long acquaintance, the more he knows of him\r\nthe more he loves him.\r\n\r\nSubsequently Suetonius became private secretary (_Magister Epistolarum_)\r\nto Hadrian,[1234] but was deprived of the situation. Owing to the only\r\nsources of information respecting Suetonius being his own works, and the\r\nfew scattered notices in the letters of Plinius Secundus, nothing more\r\nis known respecting his life.\r\n\r\nA catalogue of his numerous writings is given by Suidas:[1235] but, with\r\nthe exception of the Lives of the Twelve Cæsars, it does not contain his\r\nchief extant works. These are notices of illustrious grammarians and\r\nrhetoricians, and the lives of the poets Terence, Horace, Persius,\r\nLucan, and Juvenal.\r\n\r\nNiebuhr[1236] believed that the history, or rather the biography of the\r\nCæsars was written when Suetonius was still young, before he was\r\nsecretary to Hadrian, and previous to the publication of the Histories\r\nof Tacitus. If so, he neither enjoyed the opportunities of consulting\r\nthe imperial records which his situation at court would have given him,\r\nnor of profiting by the accurate guidance and profound reflection of\r\nTacitus. Krause,[1237] on the other hand, adduces many parallelisms\r\nbetween the language of Tacitus and Suetonius; and as Tacitus did not\r\npublish his earliest historical work before A. D. 117,[1238] assumes\r\nthat Suetonius did not write his biographies until after the accession\r\nof Hadrian.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to determine which of these theories is the correct\r\none; but there can be no doubt that the sources from which he derived\r\nhis information are quite independent of the authority of Tacitus; and\r\nthat the Lives of the Twelve Cæsars would have contained all that we\r\nfind in them, even if the Annals and Histories had never been written.\r\nHe does not only trust to the works of the Roman historians, but his\r\nexact quotations from acts of the senate and people, edicts, fasti, and\r\norations, and the use which he makes of annals and inscriptions, prove\r\nthat he was a man of diligent research, and that he examined original\r\ndocuments for himself.\r\n\r\nAgain, as a writer of biographical memoirs rather than of regular\r\nhistory, and fond of anecdote and scandal, he availed himself largely of\r\nsuch private letters of Emperors and their dependants as fell in his\r\nway, of testamentary documents, and of the information he could collect\r\nin conversation. Many of the lives which he wrote were those of his\r\ncontemporaries. Some of the events recorded were passing under the eyes\r\nof the public, and were matters of notoriety. He himself asserts in\r\nthree several places[1239] that he received some of the accounts which\r\nhe gives from the testimony of eye-witnesses. The more secret habits of\r\nthe Emperors, either truly told or exaggerated by an appetite for\r\nscandal, would ooze out. Anecdotes of the reigning Emperor’s private\r\nlife would be eagerly sought for, and be the favourite topic of gossip\r\nin all circles of Roman society. Nor would he have any difficulty in\r\nprocuring copious stores of information respecting those Emperors who\r\nreigned before he was born from those of his contemporaries who were a\r\ngeneration older than himself, and who were spectators of, or actors in,\r\nmany of the scenes which he describes. As a biographer, there is no\r\nreason to doubt his honesty and veracity; he is industrious and careful;\r\nhe indulges neither in ornament of style nor in romantic exaggeration;\r\nthe picture which he draws is a terrible one, but it is fully supported\r\nby the contemporary authority of Juvenal and Tacitus. Nevertheless, his\r\nmind was not of that comprehensive and philosophical character which\r\nwould qualify him for taking an enlarged view of political affairs, or\r\nfor the work of an historian. He has no definite plan formed in his\r\nmind, without which an historian can never hope to make his work a\r\ncomplete whole; he wanders at will from one subject to another, just as\r\nthe idea seizes him, and is by no means careful of committing offences\r\nagainst chronological order.\r\n\r\nNiebuhr accuses him of inconsistency in the character which he draws and\r\nthe praise which he bestows on Vespasian:[1240] but adds what may, in\r\nsome sort, be considered a defence, namely, that Vespasian was,\r\nnegatively speaking, a good, upright, and just man, and that the dark\r\nside of his character must be considered in reference to the fearful\r\ntimes in which he reigned. He also mentions, as an example of his\r\ndeficiencies as an historian, the bad accounts which he has left of his\r\nown times, especially of the anarchy which followed Nero’s death, and\r\nthe commencement of the reign of Vespasian. But in his praise it may be\r\nsaid that Suetonius has formed a just estimate of his own powers in\r\nundertaking to be a biographer and not an historian; and it is scarcely\r\nfair to criticise severely his unfitness for a task to which he made no\r\npretensions.\r\n\r\nOne great fault pollutes his pages. The dark pictures which he draws of\r\nthe most profligate Emperors, the disgusting annals of their unheard-of\r\ncrimes, are dwelt upon as though he took pleasure in the description,\r\nand loved to wallow in the mire of the foulest debauchery. Truth,\r\nperhaps, required that they should not have been passed over in silence,\r\nbut they might have been lightly touched, and not painted in detail with\r\nrevolting faithfulness. He is often brief, sometimes obscure: in such\r\npassages of his narrative we would have gladly welcomed both brevity and\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Q. CURTIUS RUFUS.\r\n\r\nThe doubts which have always been entertained respecting the time when\r\nthe biographer of Alexander the Great flourished, and which no\r\ninvestigations have been sufficient to dissipate, render it impossible\r\nto pass him by unnoticed, although he may, perhaps, belong to an age\r\nbeyond the chronological limits of this work. The purity of his style\r\nhas, in the opinion of some critics, entitled him to a place among the\r\nwriters of the silver age; whilst Niebuhr, judging by the internal\r\nevidence, thinks that he must have lived as late as the reign of\r\nCaracalla or Septimius Severus.\r\n\r\nNo valid argument, however, can be based upon his style, because it is\r\nevidently artificial: it is, indeed, infected with a love of declamatory\r\nornament; it is sometimes more like poetry than prose; it abounds in\r\nmetaphors, and therefore proves that he lived in a rhetorical age; but\r\nit is upon the whole an imitation of the Latinity of Livy. This\r\nrhetorical character of his style gives some value to the opinion of F.\r\nA. Wolf, that he was the Q. Curtius Rufus mentioned by Suetonius in his\r\ntreatise on Illustrious Orators. If so, he was probably a contemporary.\r\n\r\nWith respect to internal evidence, reference has been made to two\r\npassages as containing allusions to his times. (1.) Multis ergo casibus\r\ndefuncta (sc. Tyrus,) nunc tamen longa pace cuncta refovente, sub tutela\r\nRomanæ mansuetudinis acquiescit.[1241] (2.) Proinde jure meritoque P. R.\r\nsalutem se principi suo debere profitetur, qui noctis, quam pæne\r\nsupremam habuimus, novum sidus illuxit, hujus hercule, non solis ortus,\r\nlucem caliganti reddidit mundo, cum sine suo capite discordia membra\r\ntrepidarent.[1242] The former has been considered descriptive of many\r\nperiods in Roman history: although Niebuhr[1243] makes the unqualified\r\nassertion, that it has no meaning, unless it alludes to the times of\r\nSeptimius Severus and Caracalla. The latter is equally vague: Niebuhr\r\nthinks it might refer to Aurelian: Gibbon considers that it alluded to\r\nGordian. But to how many Emperors might a spirit of eulogistic flattery\r\nmake it applicable! Upon the whole, it is most probable that he lived\r\ntowards the close of the first century.\r\n\r\nThe biography of Alexander is deeply interesting; for, although Curtius\r\nevidently disdains historic reality, his hero always seems to have a\r\nliving existence: it is a romance rather than a history. He never loses\r\nan opportunity by the colouring which he gives to historical facts of\r\nelevating the Macedonian conqueror to a superhuman standard. He has no\r\ninclination to weigh the merits of conflicting historical testimonies:\r\nhe selects that which supports his partial predilections; nor are his\r\ntalents for story-telling checked by a profound knowledge of either\r\ntactics or geography, or other objective historical materials, for\r\ncorrect details in which he is too frequently negligent.[1244] His\r\nflorid and ornamented style is suitable to the imaginary orations which\r\nare introduced in the narrative, and which constitute the most striking\r\nportions of the work. The sources from which he derived his information\r\nare various, the principal one being the account of Alexander’s exploits\r\nby the Greek historian Clitarchus, who accompanied the Macedonian\r\nconqueror in his Asiatic expedition. He is, however, by no means a\r\nservile follower; for in one instance he does not hesitate to accuse him\r\nof inaccuracy. They were, however, kindred spirits: both would sacrifice\r\ntruth to romantic interest; both indulged in the same tale-telling\r\ntendency. His work originally consisted of ten books. Two of these are\r\nlost, and their places have been supplied, in a very inferior manner, by\r\nCellarius and Freinsheim. Even in the eight books which are extant, an\r\nhiatus of more or less extent occasionally occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           L. ANNÆUS FLORUS.\r\n\r\nBrief as the epitomes are which bear the name of L. Annæus Florus, the\r\nstyle is characterized by the rhetorical spirit of the age to which they\r\nbelong. They are diffuse and declamatory, and their author is rather the\r\npanegyrist of his countrymen than the grave and sober narrator of the\r\nmost important events contained in their history. This short summary,\r\nentitled “_Rerum Romanarum_, Libri IV.,” or “_Epitome de Gestis\r\nRomanorum_,” is a well-arranged compilation from the authorities extant;\r\nbut it is probable that, like all other Roman historians except Velleius\r\nPaterculus, he derived his materials principally from Livy. Such a dry\r\nskeleton of history, however, must be uninteresting. Who the author was\r\nis by no means certain. Some have supposed him to be the same with\r\nAnnæus Florus, who wrote three trochaic verses to Hadrian. Titze[1245]\r\nimagines that it is the work of two authors, one a contemporary of\r\nHorace,[1246] the other belonging to a later literary period.\r\n\r\nIt is generally assumed that the author[1247] of the Epitomes was either\r\na Spaniard or a Gaul; and, if we may consider the introduction to the\r\nwork as genuine, he lived in the reign of Trajan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\nM. ANNÆUS SENECA—HIS CONTROVERSY AND SUASORIÆ—L. ANNÆUS SENECA—TUTOR TO\r\nNERO—HIS ENORMOUS FORTUNE—HIS DEATH AND CHARACTER—INCONSISTENCIES IN HIS\r\nPHILOSOPHY—A FAVOURITE WITH EARLY CHRISTIAN WRITERS—HIS EPISTLES—WORK ON\r\n              NATURAL PHENOMENA—APOCOLOCYNTOSIS—HIS STYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           M. ANNÆUS SENECA.\r\n\r\nThe family of the Senecas exercised a remarkable influence over\r\nliterature; they may, in fact, be said to have given the tone to the\r\ntaste of their age.\r\n\r\nM. Annæus Seneca was born at Corduba (Cordova.) The precise date of his\r\nbirth is unknown; but Clinton places it about B. C. 61. This is not\r\nimprobable, for he asserts[1248] that he had heard all the eminent\r\norators except Cicero, and that he might have enjoyed that privilege\r\nalso if the civil wars had not compelled him to remain in his native\r\ncountry. After this hinderance was removed by the accession of Augustus\r\nhe came to Rome, and, as a professional rhetorician, amassed a\r\nconsiderable fortune. Subsequently he returned to Cordova, and married\r\nHelvia, by whom he had three sons, of whom L. Annæus Seneca, the\r\nphilosopher, was the eldest.\r\n\r\nHe left behind him two works, the composition of which was the\r\nemployment of his old age. They are the results of his long and\r\nsuccessful experience as a teacher of rhetoric, the gleanings of his\r\ncommonplace book, the stores accumulated by his astonishing memory,\r\nwhich enabled him to repeat two thousand unconnected words after once\r\nhearing them, and to report literally any orations which he had heard\r\ndelivered. They are valuable as showing how a hollow and artificial\r\nsystem, based upon the recollection of stock-passages and commonplaces,\r\nhad supplanted the natural promptings of true eloquence. They explain\r\nthe principles and practice of instruction in the popular schools of\r\nrhetoric, the means by which the absence of natural endowments could be\r\ncompensated. They exhibit wit, learning, ingenuity, and taste to select\r\nand admire the best literary specimens of earlier periods; but it is\r\nplain that matter was now subordinate to form—that the orator was\r\ncontent to borrow the phraseology of his predecessors in which to clothe\r\nsentiments which he could neither feel nor understand. The ear still\r\nyearned for the language of sincerity, although the heart no longer\r\nthrobbed with the ardour of patriotism. It is this want of conformity of\r\nideas to words which causes the coldness of a declamatory and florid\r\nstyle. It is a mere representation of warmth: it disappoints like a mere\r\npainted fire.\r\n\r\nThe first work of M. Seneca was entitled _Controversiæ_: it was divided\r\ninto ten books, of which, with the exception of fragments, only the\r\nfirst, second, seventh, eighth, and tenth are extant. It contains a\r\nseries of exercises or declamations in judicial oratory on fictitious\r\ncases. The imaginary causes were probably sketched out by the professor.\r\nThe students composed their speeches according to the rules of rhetoric:\r\nthey were then corrected, committed to memory, and recited, partly with\r\na view to practice, partly in order to amuse an admiring audience. The\r\ncases are frequently as puerile as a schoolboy’s theme, sometimes\r\nextravagant and absurd.\r\n\r\nHis other work, the _Suasoriæ_, contains exercises in deliberative\r\noratory. The subjects of them are taken from the historians and poets:\r\nthey are as harmless as tyranny could desire: there is no danger that\r\nlanguid patriotism should revive, or the empire be menaced, by such\r\nuninteresting discussions. Nor were they confined to mere students.\r\nPublic recitations had, since the days of Juvenal, been one of the\r\ncrying nuisances of the times. The poets began it, the rhetoricians\r\nfollowed, and the most absurd trash was listened to with patience, being\r\nushered into popular notice by partial flatterers or hired claqueurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           L. ANNÆUS SENECA.\r\n\r\nL. Seneca was born at his father’s native town about the commencement of\r\nthe Christian era. He was brought to Rome when very young, and there\r\nstudied rhetoric and philosophy. He soon displayed great talents as a\r\npleader; and by his success is said to have provoked the jealousy of\r\nCaligula. In the reign of Claudius he was accused by the infamous\r\nMessalina of improper intimacy with Julia, the emperor’s niece, and was\r\naccordingly banished to Corsica.[1249] He solaced his exile with the\r\nstudy of the Stoic philosophy; and although its severe precepts\r\nexercised no moral influence over his conduct, he not only professed\r\nhimself a Stoic, but sincerely imagined that he was one. Eight years\r\nafterwards Agrippina caused his recall,[1250] in order to make him tutor\r\nto her son Nero.\r\n\r\nHis pupil was naturally vicious; and Seneca, though wise and prudent,\r\nwas too unscrupulous a man of the world to attempt the correction of his\r\npropensities, or to instil into him high principles. After the accession\r\nof Nero,[1251] Seneca endeavoured to arrest his depraved career; but it\r\nwas too late: all he could do was to put into his mouth specious words\r\nof clemency and mercy. He saw how dangerous was the unprincipled\r\nambition of Agrippina; and dreadful though it was to sanction parricide,\r\nthere was scarcely any other course to be pursued, except the consenting\r\nto her death. When the deed was done, he had the pitiful meanness to\r\nscreen the murderer by a falsehood. He wrote a letter, which Nero sent\r\nto the senate, accusing his mother of treason, and asserting that she\r\nhad committed suicide.[1252]\r\n\r\nSeneca had by usury and legacy-hunting, amassed one of those enormous\r\nfortunes, of which so many instances are met with in Roman history. This\r\nhad already exposed him to envy,[1253] and caused his temporary\r\nbanishment to the Balearic isles.[1254] But after that Burrus was dead,\r\nwho shared his influence over the Emperor, he felt the dangers of\r\nwealth, and offered his property to Nero.[1255] The Emperor refused; but\r\nSeneca retired from public life. Being now under the influence of new\r\nfavourites, Nero wished to rid himself of Seneca; and although there was\r\nno evidence of his being privy to the conspiracy of Piso, it furnished a\r\npretext for his destruction.[1256] In adversity his character shone with\r\nbrighter lustre. Though he had lived ill, he could die well. His\r\nfirmness was the result, not of Stoical indifference, but of Roman\r\ncourage. He met the messengers of death without trembling. His noble\r\nwife Paullina determined to die with him. The veins of both were opened\r\nat the same time. The little blood which remained in his emaciated and\r\nenfeebled frame refused to flow: he suffered excruciating agony: a warm\r\nbath was applied, but in vain; and a draught of poison was equally\r\nineffectual. At last he was suffocated by the vapour of a stove, and\r\nexpired.[1257]\r\n\r\nSeneca lived in a perilous atmosphere. The philosophy in which he\r\nbelieved was hollow, and, being unsuited to his court life,[1258] he\r\nthought it expedient to allow himself some relaxation from its severity.\r\nHis rhetorical taste led him to overstate even his own real convictions;\r\nand hence the incongruity of his life appeared more glaring. He was not\r\ninsincere; but he had not firmness to act up to the high moral standard\r\nwhich he proposed to himself. In his letters, and his treatise “_De\r\nConsolatione_,” addressed to Polybius, he even convicts himself of this\r\ndefect. He had difficult questions to decide, and had not sufficient\r\nmoral principle to lead him in the right course. He was avaricious; but\r\nit was the great sin of his times. Tacitus is not blind to his\r\nweaknesses;[1259] but he estimates his character with more candour and\r\nfairness than Dio.[1260] He is neither a panegyrist nor an accuser. The\r\neducation of one who was a brute rather than a man was a task to the\r\ndischarge of which no one would have been equal. He, therefore, retained\r\nthe influence which he had not uprightness to command by miserable and\r\nsinful expedients. He had great abilities, and some of the noble\r\nqualities of the old Romans. Had he lived in the days of the Republic he\r\nwould have been a great man.\r\n\r\nSeneca was the author of twelve ethical treatises, the best of which are\r\nentitled “_De Providentiâ_,” “_De Constantiâ Sapientis_,” and “_De\r\nConsolatione_.” The latter was addressed to his mother Helvia, and\r\nwritten during his exile in Corsica. In the treatise on Providence he\r\ndiscusses the question why, since there is a Divine Providence, good men\r\nare liable to misfortunes. Although the difficulty is explained by the\r\ndoctrine that the remedy, “_suicide_,” is always in man’s power, it\r\nasserts the omnipresence of the Deity, and the existence of a moral\r\nGovernor of the universe.\r\n\r\nGreat as are the inconsistencies in his ethical philosophy (nor could it\r\nbe otherwise, as his life was always doing despite to his moral sense of\r\nright and wrong,) his views are generally clear and practical. In this\r\nhe was a true Roman; he cared little for abstract speculation; he did\r\nnot value, except as subordinate aids, either mental or natural\r\nphilosophy. He delighted to inculcate precepts rather than investigate\r\nprinciples. It is for this reason that his works are not satisfactory as\r\na whole, whilst they furnish a rich mine for quotations. The fault which\r\npervades all Roman philosophy exists in an exaggerated form in his\r\nworks: they are ethical digests of didactic precepts; but there is no\r\nsystem, no developement of new truths. His studies taught him that\r\ngeneral principles are the foundations of morals, and that casuistry is\r\nthe application of those principles;[1261] but the Romans were naturally\r\ninclined to be casuists rather than moralists; and in this preference\r\nSeneca went beyond all his countrymen. He writes like a teacher of youth\r\nrather than as a philosopher; he inculcates, without proof, maxims and\r\ninstructions, and impresses them by repetition, as though they\r\nrecommended themselves by their intrinsic truthfulness to the\r\nconsciences of his hearers.\r\n\r\nSeneca was always a favourite with Christian writers; he is in fact a\r\nbetter guide to others than he was to himself. Some of his sentiments\r\nare truly Christian; there is even a tradition that he was acquainted\r\nwith St. Paul, and fourteen letters to that apostle have been, though\r\nwithout grounds, attributed to him. He may, however, unconsciously have\r\nimbibed some of the principles of Christianity. The gospel had already\r\nmade great and rapid strides over the civilized world, and thoughtful\r\nminds may have been enlightened by some of the rays of divine truth\r\ndispersed through the moral atmosphere, just as we are benefited by the\r\nlight of the sun, even when its disc is obscured by clouds.\r\n\r\nHis Epistles, of which there are one hundred and twenty-four, are moral\r\nessays in an epistolary form, and are the most delightful of his works.\r\nAlthough addressed to a disciple named Lucilius, they are evidently\r\nwritten for the public eye: they are rich in varied thought, and the\r\nreflections flow naturally and without effort. Letters were perhaps the\r\nmost appropriate vehicle for his preceptive philosophy, because such a\r\ndesultory style is best adapted to convey isolated and unconnected\r\nmaxims. They contain a free and unconstrained picture of his mind. We\r\nsee in them how he despised verbal subtleties,[1262] the external badges\r\nof a sect or creed, and insisted that the great end of science is to\r\nlearn how to live and how to die.\r\n\r\nIn his old age he wrote seven books on questions connected with natural\r\nphenomena (_Quæstionum Naturalium_, Libri vii.) Why he did so it is\r\nimpossible to say, since he had so often argued against the utility of\r\nphysical studies.[1263] The declamatory praise which he bestows upon\r\nthem in this work would lead us to suppose that it was a mere exercise\r\nfor amusement and relaxation. But in this case he is not so inconsistent\r\nas might be supposed—he treats the subject like a moralist, and makes it\r\nthe occasion of ethical reflections.[1264]\r\n\r\nOnce he indulged in the playfulness of satire. He had written a fulsome\r\nfuneral oration on Claudius, which Nero delivered in the midst of\r\nlaughter and derision; but for this abject flattery he afterwards made\r\ncompensation by composing, as a parody on the apotheosis of the stupid\r\nEmperor, the _Apocolocyntosis_, or his metamorphosis into a pumpkin. The\r\npun was good enough, but the execution miserable.\r\n\r\nIn the style of Seneca we see the result of that false declamatory taste\r\nof which the works of his father furnish specimens. Thought was\r\nsubordinate to expression. The masters of rhetoric were all in all. His\r\nstyle is too elaborate to please; it is generally affected, often florid\r\nand bombastic: he seems always striving to produce striking effects,\r\neither by antithesis or ornament; of course he defeats his object, for\r\nthere is no light and shade. There is too much sparkle and glitter, too\r\nlittle repose and simplicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n  PLINY THE ELDER—HIS HABITS DESCRIBED BY HIS NEPHEW—HIS INDUSTRY AND\r\nAPPLICATION—HIS DEATH IN THE ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS—THE ERUPTION DESCRIBED\r\n  IN TWO LETTERS OF PLINY THE YOUNGER—THE NATURAL HISTORY OF PLINY—ITS\r\nSUBJECTS DESCRIBED—PLINY THE YOUNGER—HIS AFFECTION FOR HIS GUARDIAN—HIS\r\n PANEGYRIC, LETTERS, AND DESPATCHES—THAT CONCERNING THE CHRISTIANS—THE\r\n                                ANSWER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          C. PLINIUS SECUNDUS.\r\n\r\nPliny the Elder was born A. D. 23, either at Verona[1265] or\r\nNovo-Comum[1266] (Como.) As he possessed estates at the latter town, and\r\nhis nephew, the younger Pliny, whom he adopted, was undoubtedly born\r\nthere, it was most probably the family residence and the place of the\r\nelder Pliny’s nativity. He was educated at Rome; and serving Claudius in\r\nGermany, employed the opportunities which this campaign afforded him in\r\ntravelling. Afterwards he returned to Rome and practised at the bar;\r\nfilled different civil offices, amongst them that of augur, and was\r\nsubsequently appointed procurator in Spain.[1267]\r\n\r\nSome interesting particulars respecting his life and habits are\r\ncontained in a letter of the younger Pliny to his friend Macer,[1268]\r\nillustrative of his studies, his temper, his thirst for knowledge, and\r\nhis strict economy of time. The letter is also valuable for another\r\nreason—namely, as giving a catalogue of all the writings of his uncle.\r\n“It is a great satisfaction to me,” he writes, “that you so constantly\r\nand diligently read my uncle’s works, that you wish to possess them all,\r\nand ask me for a list of them. I will therefore perform the duty of an\r\nindex; and will also tell you the order in which they were written.” He\r\nthen subjoins the following titles:—(1.) The Art of using the Javelin on\r\nHorseback; composed when he was commander of cavalry in Germany. (2.)\r\nThe Life of his friend Pomponius Secundus. (3.) A History of all the\r\nWars, twenty in number, which the Romans had carried on with the\r\nGermans. This was commenced during his German campaign, in obedience to\r\nthe suggestions of a dream:—“There appeared to him whilst sleeping the\r\nshade of Drusus; commended his memory to his care, and besought him to\r\nrescue it from undeserved oblivion.” In accordance with his\r\nsuperstitious and credulous temper, he obeyed the call of his\r\nsupernatural visitant. (4.) A treatise on Eloquence, entitled\r\n“Studiosus,” in three books, but subdivided, on account of its length,\r\ninto six volumes. In it he traces the education of an orator from the\r\nvery cradle. (5.) Eight books on Grammatical Ambiguity, which he wrote\r\nduring the reign of Nero, a period when imperial tyranny rendered\r\nstudies of a freer kind too perilous. (6.) Thirty books in continuation\r\nof the History of Aufidius Bassus, dedicated to the Emperor Titus.[1269]\r\n(7.) Thirty-seven books on Natural History—a work, not only, as Pliny\r\nthe Younger describes it, as full of variety as Nature herself, but, as\r\nwill be shown hereafter, a treasure-house of the arts, as well as of\r\nnatural objects.\r\n\r\n“You will wonder,” he continues, “how a man occupied with official\r\nbusiness could have completed so many volumes filled with such minute\r\ninformation. You will be still more surprised to learn that he practised\r\nsometimes as a pleader; that he died in his fifty-sixth year; and that\r\nthe intermediate time was distracted and interrupted by the friendship\r\nof princes and most important public affairs. But he was a man of\r\nvigorous intellect, incredible application, and unwearied activity.\r\nImmediately after the festival of the Vulcanalia (August 23d,) he used\r\nto begin to study in the dead of the night; in the winter at one o’clock\r\nin the morning, at the latest at two, often at midnight. No one ever\r\nslept so little—sometimes he would snatch a brief interval of sleep in\r\nthe midst of his studies. Before dawn he would wait upon the Emperor,\r\nfor he also used the night for transacting business. Thence he proceeded\r\nto the discharge of his official duties; and whatever time remained he\r\ndevoted to study.\r\n\r\n“After a light and frugal meal, which, according to the old fashion, he\r\npartook of by day, he would in summer, if he had any leisure time,\r\nrecline in the sun whilst a book was read to him, from which he took\r\nnotes and made extracts. In fact, he never read any book without making\r\nextracts; for he used to say that no book was so bad but that some\r\nprofit could be derived from it. After sunset he generally took a cold\r\nbath, then a slight repast, and afterwards slept for a very short time.\r\nWhen he awoke, as if it were a new day, he studied till supper; during\r\nwhich a book was read, on which he made annotations as the reading\r\nproceeded. I remember that one of his friends interrupted the reader,\r\nbecause he had mispronounced a word, and compelled him to repeat it;\r\nupon which my uncle asked, ‘Did you understand him?’ and when he\r\nanswered in the affirmative, he continued—‘Why did you interrupt him? we\r\nhave lost more than ten lines;’—so frugal was he of his time. In summer\r\nhe rose from the supper-table by daylight, in winter at nightfall; and\r\nthis custom was a law to him.\r\n\r\n“These were his habits amidst the toils and bustle of a town-life. In\r\nthe retirement of the country the bath was the only interruption to his\r\nstudies. But only the bath itself, for whilst he was rubbed and wiped\r\ndry, he either dictated to an amanuensis or had a book read to him. On\r\njourneys, as he was then relieved from all other cares, study was the\r\nonly employment of his leisure. He had a precis-writer at his side, with\r\nbooks and tablets, who in the winter wore gloves, so that his master’s\r\nstudies might not be interrupted by the severity of the cold. For the\r\nsame reason, when at Rome, he always used a sedan. I remember once\r\nhaving been chid by him for walking: ‘You might,’ said he, ‘avoid\r\nwasting all this time.’ For he thought all time was lost which was not\r\ndevoted to study. By this intense application he completed so many\r\nvolumes, and bequeathed to me, besides, one hundred and sixty rolls of\r\ncommentaries, written in the smallest possible hand and on both sides.\r\nHe used to say that when he was procurator in Spain, he was offered for\r\na portion of them 400,000 sesterces (about 3,200_l._) by Lartius\r\nLicinius.... I cannot help laughing when people call me studious, for,\r\ncompared with him, I am the idlest fellow in the world.”\r\n\r\nPliny perished a martyr to the cause of science, in the terrible\r\neruption of Vesuvius, which took place in the first year of the reign of\r\nTitus.[1270] Had he been as ardent an original observer in all other\r\nrespects, instead of a mere plodding student, and collector, and\r\ntranscriber of other men’s observations, his works would have been less\r\nvoluminous, but more valuable. The eruption in which he perished was the\r\nfirst of which there is any record in history. It is probable that none\r\nof any consequence had occurred before; and that the lava had never\r\nbefore devastated the smiling slopes and green vineyards which Martial\r\nhas described.[1271] The circumstances of his death are thus described\r\nby his nephew[1272] in two letters to Tacitus:—“He was at Misenum, in\r\ncommand of the fleet. On the 24th of August, about one o’clock P. M., my\r\nmother pointed out to him a cloud of unusual size and appearance. He had\r\nlain in the sunshine, bathed, and taken refreshment, and was now\r\nstudying. He forthwith asked for his shoes; and ascended an eminence\r\nfrom which he could best see the phenomenon. The distance was too great\r\nto know for certain from what mountain the cloud arose, but it was\r\nafterwards ascertained to be Vesuvius. Its form resembled that of a pine\r\ntree more than anything else. It rose into the air in the form of a tall\r\ntrunk, and then diffused itself like spreading branches. The reason of\r\nthis I take to be that it was at first carried upwards by a fresh\r\ncurrent of air, which as it grew older and weaker was unable to support\r\nit, or perhaps its own gravity caused it to vanish in a horizontal\r\ndirection. Sometimes it was white, sometimes solid and spotted,\r\naccording to the quantity of earth and ashes which it threw up.\r\n\r\n“The phenomenon appeared to him, as a learned man, deserving of closer\r\ninvestigation. He ordered a light galley to be fitted out, and gave me\r\npermission to accompany him. I replied that I preferred studying, and as\r\nit chanced he himself had given me something to write. Just as he was\r\nleaving the house with his note-book in his hand, the troops stationed\r\nat Retina, a village at the foot of the mountain, from which there was\r\nno escape except by sea, alarmed by the imminent peril they were in,\r\nsent to entreat him to rescue them. Notwithstanding this circumstance\r\nhis determination was unaltered; but the task which he had commenced\r\nwith earnestness he went through with the greatest resolution.\r\n\r\n“He launched some quadriremes, and embarked for the purpose of\r\nassisting, not Retina only, but others; for the beauty of the coast had\r\nattracted a large population. He hastened to the spot whence others were\r\nflying, and steered a direct course to the point of danger, so\r\nfearlessly that he observed all the phases and forms of that sad\r\ncalamity, and dictated his remarks on them to his secretary. Soon ashes\r\nfell on the decks, and the nearer he approached the hotter and thicker\r\nthey became. With them were mingled scorched and blackened\r\npumice-stones, and stones split by fire. Now the sudden reflux of the\r\nsea, and the fragments of the volcano which covered the coast, presented\r\nan obstacle to his progress, and he hesitated for awhile whether he\r\nshould not return. At length, when his sailing-master recommended him to\r\ndo so, he exclaimed, ‘Fortune favours the brave—steer for the villa of\r\nPomponianus.’\r\n\r\n“This was situated at Stabiæ, and was divided from the coast near\r\nVesuvius by an inlet or gulf formed by the sea. His friend, although\r\ndanger was not yet imminent, yet, as it was within sight, and would be\r\nvery near if it increased, had put his baggage on board of a ship, and\r\nhad determined on flight if the wind, which was then contrary, should\r\nlull. A fair wind carried my uncle thither. He embraced his trembling\r\nfriend, consoled and encouraged him. In order to assuage his fears by\r\nshowing his own unconcern, he caused himself to be carried to a bath:\r\nafter bathing, he sat down to supper with cheerfulness, or, what is\r\nalmost the same thing, with the appearance of it. Meanwhile from many\r\nparts of the volcano broad flames burst forth: the blaze was reflected\r\nfrom the sky, and the glare and brightness were enhanced by the darkness\r\nof the night. He, to soothe the alarm of Pomponianus, endeavoured to\r\npersuade him that what he saw was only the burning villages which the\r\ncountry people had deserted in their consternation. He then retired to\r\nrest and slept soundly; for his snoring, which on account of his broad\r\nchest was deep and resonant, was heard by those who were watching at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n“Soon the court through which there was access to his apartment was so\r\nchoked with cinders and pumice that longer delay would have rendered\r\nescape impossible. He was awakened; and went to Pomponianus and the\r\nrest, who had sat up all night. They then held a consultation whether\r\nthey should remain in the house or go into the open fields. For repeated\r\nshocks of an earthquake made the houses rock to and fro, and seemed to\r\nmove them from their foundations; whilst in the air the fall of\r\nhalf-burnt pumice, though light, menaced danger. After balancing the two\r\ndangers, he chose the latter course: with him, however, it was a\r\ncomparison of reasons, with others of fears. They tied cushions over\r\ntheir heads with towels, to protect them from the falling stones.\r\nAlthough it was now day elsewhere, the darkness here was denser than the\r\ndarkest night, broken only by torches and lights of different kinds.\r\nThey next walked out to the coast to see whether the sea was calm enough\r\nto venture upon it, but it was still a waste of stormy waters. Then he\r\nspread a linen cloth and lay down upon it, asked for two or three\r\ndraughts of cold water; and, afterwards, flames, and that sulphureous\r\nsmell which is the forerunner of them, put his companions to flight and\r\naroused him.\r\n\r\n“He arose by the assistance of two slaves, and immediately fell down\r\ndead, suffocated as I imagine by the dense vapour, and the functions of\r\nhis stomach being disordered, which were naturally weak, and liable to\r\nobstructions and difficulty of digestion. On the morning of the third\r\nday after his body was found entire, uninjured, and in the clothes in\r\nwhich he died: its appearance was rather that of sleep than death.”\r\n\r\nPliny the Younger was left with his mother at Misenum; and in another\r\nletter he gives an account of the appearance of the eruption at that\r\nplace:[1273]—\r\n\r\n“After my uncle’s departure, I spent some time in study (for that was my\r\nobject in remaining behind:) I then bathed and supped, and had some\r\nbroken and restless sleep. For many days previously shocks of an\r\nearthquake had been felt; but they caused less alarm because they are\r\nusual in Campania; but on that night they were so violent that it was\r\nthought they would not only shake but overturn everything. My mother\r\nburst into my bed-chamber—I was just rising in order to arouse her, in\r\ncase she should be asleep. We sat down in the court which divided the\r\nhouse from the sea. I know not whether to call this courage or\r\nimprudence, for I was only in my eighteenth year. I asked for a volume\r\nof Livy, and began to read it leisurely and to make extracts.\r\n\r\n“Well! a friend of my uncle came in who had lately arrived from Spain,\r\nand when he saw us sitting together, and me reading, he rebuked his\r\npatience and my ‘insouciance.’ Still I was not the less for that\r\nabsorbed in my book. It was now seven o’clock, and the dawn broke\r\nfaintly and languidly. The surrounding buildings were tottering; and the\r\nspace in which we were, being limited in extent, there was great reason\r\nto fear their fall. We then resolved to leave town. The populace\r\nfollowed in alarm.\r\n\r\n“When at a sufficient distance from the buildings we halted, and\r\nwitnessed many a wonderful and alarming phenomenon. The carriages which\r\nwe had ordered to be brought out, although the ground was very level,\r\nrolled in different directions, and even stones placed under the wheels\r\ncould not stop them. The sea ebbed and seemed to be repelled by the\r\nearthquake. The coast certainly had advanced, and detained many marine\r\nanimals on dry land. On the other side of the heavens hung a dark and\r\nawful cloud, riven by wreathed and quivering lines of fiery vapour, in\r\nlong flashes resembling lightning, but larger. Then our friend from\r\nSpain exclaimed, with eagerness and vehemence, ‘If your relative lives,\r\nhe doubtless wishes your safety; if he has perished, he wished you to\r\nsurvive him. Why then do you delay to escape?’ Our answer was, ‘We will\r\nnot think of our own safety so long as we are uncertain of his.’ Without\r\nany more delay he hurried off, and was soon beyond the reach of danger.\r\nSoon the cloud descended to the earth, and brooded over the sea; it\r\nshrouded Capreæ, and hid from our eyes the promontory of Misenum. My\r\nmother besought, entreated, nay, commanded me to fly by all means; she\r\nfelt that, weighed down by years and infirmity, she should die contented\r\nif she had not been the cause of my death. I, on the other hand,\r\npersisted that I would not seek safety except with her. I took her by\r\nthe hand and forced her to go forward. She obeyed reluctantly, and\r\nblamed herself for delaying me. Ashes now began to fall, though as yet\r\nin small quantities. I looked back; behind us was thick darkness, which\r\npoured over the earth like a torrent. ‘Let us turn aside from the road,’\r\nsaid I, ‘whilst we can see, for fear we should be thrown down and\r\ntrampled under foot by the crowd in the darkness.’ We had scarce time to\r\n[think about it] [sit down] when we were enveloped in darkness, not like\r\nthat of a moonless night, or clouds, but like that of a room shut up\r\nwhen the lights are extinguished. Then were heard the shrieks of women,\r\nthe wailings of infants, the shouts of men; some were calling for their\r\nparents, others for their children, others for their wives, whom they\r\ncould only recognise by their voices. Some bewailed their own\r\nmisfortune, others that of their family; some even from the fear of\r\ndeath prayed for death. Many lifted up their hands to the gods; still\r\nmore believed that there were no gods, and that the last eternal night\r\nhad overwhelmed the world. There were not wanting some to increase the\r\nreal danger by fictitious and imaginary terrors; and some brought word\r\nthat the conflagration was at Misenum: the false intelligence met with\r\ncredence. By degrees the light returned; but it seemed to us not the\r\nreturn of day, but the indication that the fire was approaching. Its\r\nprogress, however, was arrested at some distance: again darkness\r\nsucceeded with showers of ashes. Every now and then we got up and shook\r\nthem off from us, otherwise we should have been overwhelmed and bruised\r\nby their weight. I might boast that not a groan or unmanly expression\r\nescaped me in the midst of my dangers, were it not that my firmness was\r\nfounded on the consolatory belief that all mankind was involved,\r\ntogether with myself, in one common ruin. At length the darkness cleared\r\nup, and dispersed like smoke or mist. Real daylight succeeded; even the\r\nsun shone forth, but with a lurid light as when eclipsed. The aspect of\r\neverything which met our astonished eyes was changed: ashes covered the\r\nground like a deep snow. We returned to Misenum, and refreshed\r\nourselves, and passed an anxious night in alternate hopes and fears: the\r\nlatter, however, predominated. The earthquake still continued; and many,\r\nin a state of frenzy, made a mockery of their own and their neighbours’\r\nmisfortunes by terrific prophecies.” The above letters, though long,\r\nhave been quoted because they detail, in the most interesting manner,\r\nthe circumstances of the elder Pliny’s death, and at the same time\r\nillustrate the simple and graphic power of the nephew’s pen.\r\n\r\nThe Natural Philosophy of Pliny is, to say the least, an unequalled\r\nmonument of studious diligence and persevering industry. It consists of\r\nthirty-seven books, and contains, according to his own account,[1274]\r\n20,000 facts (as he believed them to be) connected with nature and art:\r\nthe result, not of original research, but, as he honestly confessed,\r\nculled from the labours of other men. It must, however, be allowed that\r\nthe confused arrangement is owing partly to the indefinite state of\r\nscience, and the consequent mingling together of branches which are\r\nseparate and distinct.[1275]\r\n\r\nOwing to the extent and variety of his reading, his credulous love of\r\nthe marvellous, and his want of judgment in comparing and selecting, he\r\ndoes not present us with a correct view of the degree of truth to which\r\nscience had attained in his own age. He does not show how one age had\r\ncorrected the errors of a preceding one; but reproduces errors,\r\nevidently obsolete and inconsistent with facts and theories which had\r\ngrown up afterwards and replaced them.\r\n\r\nWith him mythological traditions appear to have almost the same\r\nauthority as modern discoveries. The earth teems with monsters, not\r\nmiracles, or exceptions to the regular order of nature, but specimens of\r\nher ingenuity. In his theory of the universe he assumes such causes and\r\nprinciples as lead him to admit, without question, the existence of\r\nprodigies, however impossible they may be. They are wonderful because\r\nunusual; but they are effects which might result from the natural causes\r\nwhich he believed to be in operation. His theory, that Nature acted not\r\nonly by regular laws but often by actual interferences, (for this was\r\nthe character of his pantheism, ii. 5, 7,)—his belief that the various\r\ngerms of created things were scattered in profusion throughout the\r\nuniverse, and accidentally mingling in confusion produced monstrous\r\nforms, (3)—prepared him to consider nothing incredible (xi. 3;) and his\r\ntemper inclined him to go further, and to admit almost every thing which\r\nwas credible as true.[1276]\r\n\r\nDeficient as the work is in scientific value and philosophical\r\narrangement, the author evidently wished to stamp it with a character of\r\npractical utility. It is an encyclopædia of the knowledge which could be\r\nbrought together from different sources; and for such a work there are\r\ntwo important requisites—facility of reference, and the citation of\r\nauthorities. With this view the whole is preceded by a summary, and to\r\neach book is added a table of contents, together with the names of\r\nauthors to whom he is indebted.\r\n\r\nThe work commences with the theory of the universe;[1277] the history\r\nand science of astronomy; meteorological phenomena; and the geological\r\nchanges which have taken place on the earth by volcanic and aqueous\r\naction. Geography, both physical and political, occupy the four next\r\nbooks.[1278] Here truth and error are mingled in dire confusion.\r\nAccounts which are based solely on the traditions of remote antiquity\r\nare given side by side with the results of modern investigation, and yet\r\nno distinction is drawn as to authenticity; and, owing to his confusing\r\ntogether such different accounts, measurements and distances are\r\ngenerally wrong.\r\n\r\nBut in the zoological division of the work, which next follows,[1279] he\r\ngives unrestrained scope to his credulity and love of the marvellous. He\r\ntells of men whose feet were turned backwards; of others whose feet were\r\nso large as to shade them when they lay in the sun. He describes beings\r\nin whom both sexes were united; others in whom a change of sex had taken\r\nplace; others without mouths, who fed on the fragrance of fruits and\r\nflowers.[1280] Such are some of the marvels of the human race recorded\r\nby him. Amongst the lower animals he enumerates horned horses furnished\r\nwith wings;[1281] the Mantichora, with the face of a man, three rows of\r\nteeth, a lion’s body, and a scorpion’s tail;[1282] the unicorn with a\r\nstag’s head, a horse’s body, the feet of an elephant, and the tail of a\r\nboar;[1283] the basilisk, whose very glance is fatal. The seas are\r\npeopled not only with sea-goats and sea-elephants, but with real Nereids\r\nand Tritons.[1284] Mice, according to his account, produce their young\r\nby licking each other; and fire produces an insect (pyralis) which\r\ncannot live except in the midst of the flames.\r\n\r\nSixteen books[1285] are devoted to botany, both general and medical; and\r\nthe medicinal properties of the human frame, and of other animal\r\nsubstances, as well as of different waters, are next discussed.[1286] An\r\naccount of minerals and metals concludes the work; and this portion\r\nembraces an account of their various uses in the fine arts, intermingled\r\nwith interesting anecdotes and histories of art and artists. This is the\r\nmost valuable as well as the most pleasing section of the work.\r\n\r\nHe was pre-eminently a collector of stories and anecdotes and supposed\r\nfacts, and he was only accidentally a naturalist, because natural\r\nhistory furnished the most extensive variety of marvellous and curious\r\nmaterials. The naturalist, Cuvier,[1287] observed his want of judgment,\r\nhis credulity, his defective arrangement, and the inappropriate nature\r\nof his observations. Notwithstanding all these faults this elaborate\r\nwork contains many valuable truths, much entertaining information, and\r\nthe style in which it is written is, when not too florid, full of vigour\r\nand expression. The philosophical belief can scarcely be considered that\r\nof any particular school, although tinctured by the prevalent Stoicism\r\nof the day; but its pervading character is querulous and melancholy.\r\nBelieving that nature is an all-powerful principle, and the world or\r\nuniverse itself, instinct with Deity, he saw more of evil than of good\r\nin the Divine dispensations; and the result was a gloomy and\r\ndiscontented pantheism.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PLINY THE YOUNGER (BORN A. D. 61.)\r\n\r\nC. Plinius Cæcilius Secundus was sister’s son to the elder Pliny. Most\r\nof the information which we possess respecting his life and character is\r\nderived from his letters. He was born at Novo-Comum, on the Lake Larius\r\n(Como;) and as he was in his eighteenth year[1288] at the time of the\r\neruption of Vesuvius, which took place A. D. 79, the date of his birth\r\nmust have been A. D. 61.\r\n\r\nOn the death of his father, C. Cæcilius, he was adopted by his uncle,\r\nand therefore took the name of Plinius. He was educated under the\r\nguardianship of Virginius Rufus, who felt for him the affection of a\r\nparent. The regard was evidently mutual. “I loved him,” writes Pliny to\r\nVoconius,[1289] with that tenderness which so frequently adorns his\r\nletters, especially those to his wife Calphurnia, “as much as I admired\r\nhim;” and he thus concludes his letter: “I had wished to write to you on\r\nmany other subjects, but my thoughts are fully occupied on this one\r\nsubject of contemplation. I see, I think of no one but Virginius. In\r\nfancy I seem to hear his voice, to address him, to hold him in my arms.\r\nWe may perhaps have, and shall continue to have, men equal to him in\r\nvirtue, but no one equal to him in glory.” In belles-lettres and\r\neloquence[1290] he attended constantly the lectures of Quintilian and\r\nNicetes Sacerdos, of whom favourable mention is made by Seneca.[1291]\r\n\r\nUnder the care of such tutors and such an uncle, his literary tastes\r\nwere cultivated early, and before he had completed his fifteenth year he\r\ngave proof of his love of poetry, by writing what he modestly says _was\r\ncalled_ a Greek tragedy. This taste for poetry remained to him in after\r\nlife: once when weather-bound at the island of Icaria, he celebrated the\r\nevent in an elegiac poem. He wrote hexameters, of which he gives a short\r\nspecimen, and also a birth-day ode in hendecasyllables, and he tells us\r\nhe wrote with quickness and facility.[1292]\r\n\r\nHe was called to the bar in his nineteenth year, and attained great\r\ncelebrity as a pleader.[1293] He stood high in favour with Trajan; and\r\nfilled with distinction high offices, both military and civil. He was\r\nmilitary tribune in Syria; and besides being prætor and consul at home,\r\nhe served as procurator of the province of Bithynia abroad. He was\r\ngentle, liberal, refined, and benevolent; and his zeal for the interests\r\nof literature, and his wish that the youths of Como might not be forced\r\nto resort to Milan for education, but might owe that blessing to their\r\nnative place,[1294] led him to offer help in founding a school, in\r\nforming a public library, and in establishing exhibitions for ingenuous\r\nstudents.[1295] He thought with justice, such acts of munificence nobler\r\nthan gaudy spectacles and barbarous shows of gladiators.\r\n\r\nHis works consist of a Panegyric on Trajan and a collection of Letters\r\nin ten books. The Panegyric is a piece of courtly flattery, for the\r\nfulsomeness of which the only defence which can be made, is the cringing\r\nand fawning manners of his times. It was written and delivered in the\r\nyear in which he was consul.[1296] The Letters are very valuable, not\r\nonly for the insight which they give into his own character, but also\r\ninto the manners and modes of thought of his illustrious contemporaries,\r\nas well as the politics of the day. Many of them bear evident marks of\r\nhaving been expressly intended for publication. This of course detracts\r\nfrom their value as fresh and truthful exponents of the writer’s\r\nthoughts, which all letters ought to be; but they are most delightful to\r\nread, and for liveliness, descriptive power, elegance and simplicity of\r\nstyle, are scarcely inferior to those of Cicero, whom he evidently took\r\nfor his model.\r\n\r\nThe tenth book, which consists of his despatches to Trajan, together\r\nwith the Emperor’s rescripts, will be read with the greatest interest;\r\nand the notices of public affairs contained in them are most valuable to\r\nthe historian. The despatch respecting the Christians, written from\r\nBithynia, A. D. 104, and the Emperor’s answer,[1297] are well worthy of\r\ntranscription; both because reference is so often made to them, and\r\nbecause they throw light upon the marvellous and rapid propagation of\r\nthe gospel; the manners of the early Christians; the treatment to which\r\ntheir constancy exposed them, even under favourable circumstances, and\r\nthe severe jealousy with which even a governor of mild and gentle temper\r\nthought it his duty to regard them. “It is my constant practice, sire,\r\nto refer to you all subjects on which I entertain doubt. For who is\r\nbetter able to direct my hesitation or to instruct my ignorance? I have\r\nnever been present at the trials of Christians, and therefore I do not\r\nknow in what way, or to what extent, it is usual to question or to\r\npunish them. I have also felt no small difficulty in deciding whether\r\nage should make any difference, or whether those of the tenderest and\r\nthose of mature years should be treated alike; whether pardon should be\r\naccorded to repentance, or whether, where a man has once been a\r\nChristian, recantation should profit him; whether, if the name of\r\nChristian does not imply criminality, still the crimes peculiarly\r\nbelonging to the name should be punished. Meanwhile, in the case of\r\nthose against whom informations have been laid before me, I have pursued\r\nthe following line of conduct. I have put to them, personally, the\r\nquestion whether they were Christians. If they confessed, I interrogated\r\nthem a second and third time, and threatened them with punishment. If\r\nthey still persevered, I ordered their commitment; for I had no doubt\r\nwhatever that, whatever they confessed, at any rate dogged and\r\ninflexible obstinacy deserved to be punished. There were others who\r\ndisplayed similar madness; but, as they were Roman citizens, I ordered\r\nthem to be sent back to the city. Soon persecution itself, as is\r\ngenerally the case, caused the crime to spread, and it appeared in new\r\nforms. An anonymous information was laid against a large number of\r\npersons, but they deny that they are, or ever have been, Christians. As\r\nthey invoked the gods, repeating the form after me, and offered prayers,\r\ntogether with incense and wine, to your image, which I had ordered to be\r\nbrought, together with those of the deities, and besides cursed Christ,\r\nwhilst those who are true Christians, it is said, cannot be compelled to\r\ndo any one of these things, I thought it right to set them at liberty.\r\nOthers, when accused by an informer, confessed that they were\r\nChristians, and soon after denied the fact; they said they had been, but\r\nhad ceased to be, some three, some more, not a few even twenty years\r\npreviously. All these worshipped your image and those of the gods, and\r\ncursed Christ. But they affirmed that the sum total of their fault or\r\ntheir error was, that they were accustomed to assemble on a fixed day\r\nbefore dawn, and sing an antiphonal hymn to Christ as God: that they\r\nbound themselves by an oath, not to the commission of any wickedness,\r\nbut to abstain from theft, robbery, and adultery; never to break a\r\npromise, or to deny a deposit when it was demanded back. When these\r\nceremonies were concluded, it was their custom to depart, and again\r\nassemble together to take food harmlessly and in common. That after my\r\nproclamation, in which, in obedience to your command, I had forbidden\r\nassociations, they had desisted from this practice. For these reasons I\r\nthe more thought it necessary to investigate the real truth, by putting\r\nto the torture two maidens, who were called deaconesses; but I\r\ndiscovered nothing but a perverse and excessive superstition. I have\r\ntherefore deferred taking cognizance of the matter until I had consulted\r\nyou. For it seemed to me a case requiring advice, especially on account\r\nof the number of those in peril. For many of every age, sex, and rank,\r\nare and will continue to be called in question. The infection, in fact,\r\nhas spread not only through the cities, but also through the villages\r\nand open country; but it seems that its progress can be arrested. At any\r\nrate, it is clear that the temples which were almost deserted begin to\r\nbe frequented; and solemn sacrifices, which had been long intermitted,\r\nare again performed, and victims are being sold everywhere, for which up\r\nto this time a purchaser could rarely be found. It is therefore easy to\r\nconceive that crowds might be reclaimed if an opportunity for repentance\r\nwere given.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Trajan to Pliny._\r\n\r\n“In sifting the cases of those who have been indicted on the charge of\r\nChristianity, you have adopted, my dear Secundus, the right course of\r\nproceeding; for no certain rule can be laid down which will meet all\r\ncases. They must not be sought after, but if they are informed against\r\nand convicted, they must be punished; with this proviso, however, that\r\nif any one denies that he is a Christian, and proves the point by\r\noffering prayers to our deities, notwithstanding the suspicions under\r\nwhich he has laboured, he shall be pardoned on his repentance. On no\r\naccount should any anonymous charge be attended to, for it would be the\r\nworst possible precedent, and is inconsistent with the habits of our\r\ntimes.”\r\n\r\nPliny’s accurate and judicious mind, his political and administrative\r\nprudence, his taste for the beautiful, his power of description, his\r\nunrivalled neatness, his skill in investing with a peculiar interest\r\nevery subject he takes in hand, may be amply proved by a perusal of his\r\nLetters. His touches are neither too many nor too few. A mere note of\r\nthanks for a present of thrushes[1298] shows as much skill, in its way,\r\nas his numerous elaborate despatches to the Emperor.[1299] His brief\r\nbiographical notice of Silius Italicus contains, in a few short\r\nsentences, all that can be said favourably of the life and character of\r\nhis correspondent. The sympathy which he felt for his friends, as well\r\nas the delicacy of his panegyric, are exhibited in the few lines which\r\nhe penned to Germinius on the death of the wife of Macrinus;[1300] his\r\nhonesty in the case of the inheritance of Pomponia;[1301] his legal\r\nskill in passages too numerous to specify; his descriptive power in the\r\nnarrative of the eruption of Vesuvius,[1302] in which his uncle\r\nperished; and in the full and minute description of his villa, its\r\nrooms, furniture, works of art, garden, and surrounding scenery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n  M. FABIUS QUINTILIANUS—HIS BIOGRAPHY—HIS INSTITUTIONES ORATORIÆ—HIS\r\n VIEWS ON EDUCATION—DIVISION OF HIS SUBJECTS INTO FIVE PARTS—REVIEW OF\r\n  GREEK AND ROMAN LITERATURE—COMPLETENESS OF HIS GREAT WORK—HIS OTHER\r\n          WORKS—HIS DISPOSITION—GRIEF FOR THE LOSS OF HIS SON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        M. FABIUS QUINTILIANUS.\r\n\r\nIn this peculiarly rhetorical age, the most distinguished teacher of\r\nrhetoric was M. Fabius Quintilianus. He attempted to restore a purer and\r\nmore classical taste; and although to a certain extent he was\r\nsuccessful, the effect which he produced was only temporary. He was,\r\nlike Martial, a Spaniard, born[1303] at Calagurris, the modern\r\nCalahorra.[1304] At an early age he came to Rome, and had the advantage\r\nof hearing the celebrated orators Domitius Afer and Julius Africanus,\r\nwhose eloquence he considered superior to that of their\r\ncontemporaries.[1305] How long he remained at Rome is uncertain; but he\r\nappears to have gone back to his native country, and then returned to\r\nthe capital together with the Emperor Galba.\r\n\r\nAlthough he practised as a pleader, he was far more eminent as an\r\ninstructor. Domitian intrusted to him the education of his two\r\ngreat-nephews;[1306] and the younger Pliny was also one of his\r\npupils.[1307] The Emperor’s favour conferred on him that reward to which\r\nJuvenal alludes in the following lines:—\r\n\r\n             Si Fortuna volet fies de rhetore consul;[1308]\r\n\r\nand besides this he held one of the professorships which were endowed by\r\nVespasian with 100,000 sestertia per annum (800_l._[1309]) He thus\r\nformed an exception to the larger number of instructors and grammarians\r\nwho swarmed in Rome, who, depending on the fees of their pupils, earned\r\na precarious subsistence,[1310] and was even able to purchase estates\r\nand accumulate property.\r\n\r\nBut though more fortunate than many deserving members of his profession,\r\nhe was not esteemed a wealthy man by the rich and luxurious Romans of\r\nhis day; for his grateful pupil, Pliny, when he presented him with\r\n400_l._ towards his daughter’s portion, spoke of him as a man of\r\nmoderate means.[1311] His expressions are:—“Te porro, animo beatissimum,\r\nmodicum facultatibus scio.” The probability is that he was twice\r\nmarried. His first wife died at the early age of nineteen, leaving two\r\nsons, of whom death bereaved him in a few years.[1312] For the\r\ninstruction of the elder of these, who survived his younger brother for\r\nbut a short time, he wrote his great work. His second wife was the\r\ndaughter of one Tutilius, and the fruit of this marriage was an only\r\ndaughter who married Nonius Celer, and to whom the liberal present of\r\nPliny was made. For twenty years he discharged the duties of his\r\nprofessorship, and then retired from active life; and died, as is\r\ngenerally supposed, about A. D. 118. His countryman, Martial,[1313]\r\nspeaks of him as the glory of the Roman bar, and the head of his\r\nprofession as an instructor:—\r\n\r\n               Quintiliane, vagæ moderator summe juventæ,\r\n                 Gloria Romanæ, Quintiliane, togæ.[1314]\r\n\r\nQuintilian’s great work is entitled _Institutiones Oratoriæ_, or a\r\ncomplete instruction in the art of oratory: and in it he shows himself\r\nfar superior to Cicero as a teacher, although he was inferior to him as\r\nan orator. The rhetorical works of the great orator will not, in point\r\nof fulness and completeness, bear a comparison with the elaborate\r\ntreatise of Quintilian. When engaged in its composition he had retired\r\nfrom the duties of a public professor, and was only occupied, as he\r\nhimself states,[1315] with his duties as tutor to the great-nephew of\r\nDomitian. He professes to have undertaken the task reluctantly, and at\r\nthe earnest solicitations of his friends. He thought that the ground was\r\nalready pre-occupied, both by Greek and Latin writers of eminence. But\r\nseeing how wide the field was, and that such a work must treat of all\r\nthose qualifications without which no one can be an orator, he complied\r\nwith their entreaties, and dedicated his book to his friend Marcellus\r\nVictorius, as a token of his regard, and a useful contribution towards\r\nthe education of his son. Two rhetorical treatises had already appeared\r\nunder his name, but not published by himself. One consisted of a lecture\r\nwhich occupied two days in delivery; the other a longer course: and both\r\nhad been taken down in notes, and given to the public, as he says, by\r\nhis excellent but too partial pupils: (boni juvenes, sed nimium amantes\r\nmei.[1316])\r\n\r\nOn the Institutiones he professes to have expended the greatest pains\r\nand labour. He traces the progress of the orator from the very cradle\r\nuntil he arrives at perfection.[1317] He speaks of the importance of\r\nearliest impressions, of the parental, especially the maternal care, and\r\nillustrates this by the example of Cornelia, to whom the Gracchi owed\r\ntheir eminence; and brings forward, as instances of female eloquence,\r\nthe daughters of Lælius and Hortensius. He believes that education must\r\ncommence, and the tastes be formed, and the moral character be\r\nimpressed, even in infancy. The choice, therefore, of a nurse is, in his\r\nopinion, as important, as of early companions, pedagogues, and\r\ninstructors.\r\n\r\nBoth on account of the positive good to be acquired, and the evil\r\nresulting from the corrupt state of Roman society which the boy would\r\nthus avoid, he prefers a school to a home education.[1318] As we\r\nconsider the classical languages the best preparation for the study of\r\nthe vernacular tongue,[1319] so he lays down as an axiom that education\r\nin Greek literature should precede Latin. Grammar[1320] is to be the\r\nfoundation of education, together with its subdivisions, declension,\r\nconstruction,[1321] orthography,[1322] the use of words,[1323] rhythm,\r\nmetre, the beauties and faults of style,[1324] reading,[1325] delivery,\r\naction;[1326] and to these are to be added music and geometry.[1327]\r\n\r\nPrimary education being completed, the young student is to be\r\ntransferred to the care of the rhetorician.[1328] The choice of a proper\r\ninstructor,[1329] as well as his duties and character,[1330] are\r\ndescribed; the necessary exercises, the reading and study of orations\r\nand histories are recommended,[1331] and the nature, principles,\r\nobjects, and utility of oratory are accurately investigated. In the\r\nthird book, after a short notice of the principal writers on\r\nrhetoric,[1332] he divides his subject into five parts,[1333] namely,\r\ninvention, arrangement, style, memory, both natural and artificial, and\r\ndelivery or action. Closely following Aristotle, he then discusses the\r\nthree kinds of oratory, the demonstrative, deliberative, and\r\njudicial.[1334] In the fourth, he treats of the physical divisions of\r\nall orations, namely, the exordium,[1335] the narration,[1336]\r\nexcursions or digressions,[1337] the question proposed,[1338] the\r\ndivision of topics.[1339] In that part of his treatise which discusses\r\nthe next division, namely, proofs, Aristotle is his chief guide, as\r\nmeeting, in his opinion, the universal assent of all mankind. The sixth\r\nbook analyzes the peroration, and also discusses the passions,[1340]\r\nmoral habits,[1341] ridicule,[1342] and other topics, which complete the\r\nsubject of invention. The seventh treats of arrangement and its kindred\r\ntopics; the eighth and ninth of style and its essential qualities, such\r\nas perspicuity,[1343] ornament[1344] tropes,[1345] amplification,[1346]\r\nfigures of speech.[1347]\r\n\r\nFacility, or as we, in common with the Romans, frequently term it,\r\n“_copia verborum_,”[1348] is the next division of the subject; and as\r\noriginal invention has already occupied so large a portion of his work,\r\nhe now endeavours to guide the student in imitating the excellencies of\r\nthe best Greek and Latin writers; and tells him that the next duty, in\r\npoint of importance, is to profit by the inventions of others.[1349] A\r\nwide field is thus opened before him, affording an opportunity for the\r\ndisplay of his extensive learning, his critical taste, his penetrating\r\ndiscrimination, and his great power of illustration.[1350]\r\n\r\nHe passes over in rapid review the whole history of Greek and Roman\r\nliterature. His remarks, though brief, are clear and decided, and are\r\nmarked with an attractive beauty and sound judgment, which have stood\r\nthe test of ages, and recommend themselves to all who have been\r\ndistinguished for pure classical taste. So adroit is he in catching the\r\nleading features, that the portraits of great authors of antiquity,\r\nthough only sketches and outlines, stand forth in bold and tangible\r\nshape, each exhibiting marked and distinct characteristics. There are\r\nfew specimens of criticism so attractive, so suggestive, and which lay\r\nsuch hold on the memory, as this portion of the Institutions of\r\nQuintilian. Other subjects are also briefly handled in the tenth book,\r\nsuch as the necessity of pains and elaborate corrections, in order to\r\nform a polished style.[1351] The choice of materials,[1352] original\r\nthought,[1353] the means of acquiring and perfecting a habit of\r\nextemporaneous speaking.[1354]\r\n\r\nThe eleventh book is devoted to the subjects of appropriateness,\r\nmemory,[1355] and delivery.[1356]\r\n\r\nThe twelfth opens with what the author designates[1357] as the most\r\ngrave and important portion of the whole work, well worthy of the\r\ndignified character of true Roman virtue. Its subject is the high moral\r\nqualifications necessary for a perfect orator.[1358] Talent, wisdom,\r\nlearning, eloquence are nothing, if the mind is distracted and torn\r\nasunder by vicious thoughts and depraved passions.[1359] The orator,\r\ntherefore, must learn studies by what his moral character can alone be\r\nformed;[1360] he must possess that firmness of principle which will\r\ncause him fearlessly to practise what he knows. “Neque erit perfectus\r\norator nisi qui honeste dicere et sciet et audebit.”\r\n\r\nA knowledge of history[1361] and the principles of jurisprudence,[1362]\r\nhe also considers indispensably necessary, notwithstanding the slighting\r\nway in which Cicero speaks of the antiquarian learning of the\r\njurisconsults. Some practical rules[1363] are also added as to the time\r\nof commencing practice in the courts, the rules to be observed in\r\nundertaking causes,[1364] and the cautions to be attended to in\r\npreparing and pleading them.[1365] He deprecates the undertaking such\r\nimportant duties early, although the call to the bar at Rome took place\r\nas soon as the manly gown was assumed: tradition spoke of boys clothed\r\nwith the prætexta pleading. Cæsar Augustus, at twelve years old,\r\npublicly pronounced a eulogy on his grandmother, as did Tiberius at the\r\nearly age of nine over the body of his deceased father.[1366]\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show the fulness and completeness with which\r\nQuintilian has exhausted his subject, and left, as a monument of his\r\ntaste and genius, a text-book of the science and art of nations, as well\r\nas a masterly sketch of the eloquence of antiquity.\r\n\r\nThere have been attributed to Quintilian, besides his great work,\r\nnineteen declamations or judicial speeches relating to imaginary suits;\r\nalso one hundred and forty-five sketches of orations, the remains of a\r\nlarger collection, consisting of three hundred and eighty-eight. But\r\nthere is no evidence in favour of their being his, and their style seems\r\nto show that they were the work of different authors and different ages.\r\nNeither is there any good reason for considering that the treatise on\r\nthe Causes of Corrupt Eloquence is the same as that to which he alludes\r\nin the proëmium to the sixth and the conclusion of the eighth book[1367]\r\nof the Institutions. Indeed, the almost unanimous opinion of scholars\r\nassigns it to Tacitus. His works were discovered by Poggius, together\r\nwith those of Silius Italicus and L. Valerius Flaccus, in the monastery\r\nof St. Gall, twenty miles from Constance, during the sitting of the\r\ncelebrated ecclesiastical council.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of Quintilian was as affectionate and tender as his\r\ngenius was brilliant, and his taste pure. Few passages throughout the\r\nwhole range of Latin literature can be compared to that in which he\r\nmourns the loss of his wife and children. It is the touching eloquence\r\nof one who could not write otherwise than gracefully; and if he murmurs\r\nat the divine decrees, it must be remembered that his dearest hopes were\r\nblighted, and that he had not the hopes, the consolation, or the\r\nteaching of a Christian. “I had a son,” he says, “whose eminent genius\r\ndeserved a father’s anxious diligence. I thought that if—which I might\r\nfairly have expected and wished for—death had removed me from him, I\r\ncould have left him, as the best inheritance, a father’s instructions.\r\nBut by a second blow, a second bereavement, I have lost the object of my\r\nhighest hopes, the only comfort of my declining years. What shall I do\r\nnow? Of what use can I suppose myself to be, as the gods have cast me\r\noff? It happened that when I commenced my book on the Causes of Corrupt\r\nEloquence, I was stricken by a similar blow. It would surely have been\r\nbest then to have flung upon the funeral pile—which was destined\r\nprematurely to consume all that bound me to life—my unlucky work, and\r\nthe ill-starred fruits of all my toils, and not to have wearied with new\r\ncares a life to which I so unnaturally clung. For what tender parent\r\nwould pardon me if I were able to study any longer, and not hate my\r\nfirmness of mind, if I, who survived all my dear ones, could find any\r\nemployment for my tongue except to accuse the gods, and to protest that\r\nno Providence looks down upon the affairs of men? If I cannot say this\r\nin reference to my own case, to which no objection can be made except\r\nthat I survive, at least I can with reference to theirs—condemned to an\r\nunmerited and untimely grave.\r\n\r\n“Their mother had before been torn from me, who had given birth to two\r\nsons before she had completed her nineteenth year; and though her death\r\nwas a cruel blow to me, to her it was a happy one. To me the affliction\r\nwas so crushing, that fortune could no longer restore me to happiness.\r\nFor not only did the exercise of every feminine virtue render her\r\nhusband’s grief incurable, but, compared with my own age, she was but a\r\ngirl, and therefore her loss may be accounted as that of a child. Still,\r\nmy children survived, and were my joy and comfort, and she since I\r\nsurvived (a thing unnatural, although she wished it,) escaped by a\r\nprecipitate flight the agonies of grief. In my younger son, who died at\r\nfive years old, I lost one light of my eyes. I have no ambition to make\r\nmuch of my misfortunes, or to exaggerate the reasons which I have for\r\nsorrow; would that I had means of assuaging it! But how can I conceal\r\nhis lovely countenance, his endearing talk, his sparkling wit, and (what\r\nI feel can scarcely be believed) his calm and deep solidity of mind? Had\r\nhe been another’s child he would have won my love. But insidious\r\nfortune, in order to inflict on me severer anguish, made him more\r\naffectionate to me than to his nurses, his grandmother, who brought him\r\nup, and all who usually gain the attachment of children of that age.\r\n\r\n“Thankful therefore do I feel for that sorrow in which but a few months\r\nbefore I was plunged by the loss of his matchless, his inestimable\r\nmother; for my lot was less a subject for tears than hers was for\r\nrejoicing. One only hope, support, and consolation, had remained in my\r\nQuintilian. He had not, like my younger son, just put forth his early\r\nblossoms, but entering on his tenth year had shown mature and well-set\r\nfruit. I swear by my misfortunes, by the consciousness of my\r\nunhappiness, by those departed spirits, the deities who preside over my\r\ngrief, that in him I discerned such vigour of intellect, not only in the\r\nacquisition of learning (and yet in all my extensive experience I never\r\nsaw it surpassed,) such a zeal for study, which, as his tutors can\r\ntestify, never required pressing, but also such uprightness, filial\r\naffection, refinement, and generosity, as furnished grounds for\r\napprehending the thunder-stroke which has fallen. For it is generally\r\nobserved that a precocious maturity too quickly perishes; and there is I\r\nknow not what envious power which deflowers our brightest hopes, lest we\r\nsoar higher than human beings are permitted to soar. He possessed also\r\nthose gifts which are accidental—a clear and melodious voice, a sweet\r\npronunciation, a correct enunciation of every letter both in Greek and\r\nLatin. Such promise did he give of future excellence; but he possessed\r\nalso the far higher qualities of constancy, earnestness, and firmness to\r\nbear sorrow and to resist fear. With what admiration did his physicians\r\ncontemplate the patience with which he endured a malady of eight months’\r\nduration! What consolation did he administer to me in his last moments!\r\nWhen life and intellect began to fail, his wandering mind dwelt on\r\nliterature alone. O! dearest object of my disappointed hopes! could I\r\nbehold thy glazing eyes, thy fleeting breath? Could I embrace thy cold\r\nand lifeless form, and live to drink again the common air? Well do I\r\ndeserve these agonizing thoughts, these tortures which I endure!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n   A. CORNELIUS CELSUS—HIS MERITS—CICERO MEDICORUM—SCRIBONIUS LARGUS\r\n  DESIGNATIANUS—POMPONIUS MELA—L. JUNIUS MODERATUS COLUMELLA—S. JULIUS\r\nFRONTINUS—DECLINE OF TASTE IN THE SILVER AGE—FOREIGN INFLUENCE ON ROMAN\r\n                         LITERATURE—CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch were the principal writers who adorned and illustrated the\r\nliterature of the silver age: it remains only to speak briefly of those\r\nwhose works, although of minor interest, must not be passed over without\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       AURELIUS CORNELIUS CELSUS.\r\n\r\nCelsus was the author of many works on various subjects, of which one,\r\nin eight books, on Medicine, is now extant. The place of his birth and\r\nthe age at which he flourished are unknown, but he probably lived in the\r\nreign of Tiberius. He was a man of comprehensive, almost encyclopædic\r\nknowledge, and wrote on philosophy, rhetoric, agriculture, and even\r\nstrategy. It has been doubted whether he ever practised medicine, or was\r\nonly theoretically acquainted with the subject; but the independence of\r\nhis views, the practical as well as the scientific nature of his\r\ninstructions, are inconsistent with any hypothesis except that he had\r\nhimself patiently watched the phenomena of morbid action and\r\nexperimented upon its treatment. Above all, his knowledge of surgery,\r\nand his clear exposition of surgical operations, necessarily imply that\r\npractical experience and reality of knowledge which never could have\r\nbeen acquired from books.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the masterly handling of the subject by Celsus with the\r\nhistory of medicine by Pliny,[1368] it is easy to distinguish the man of\r\npractical and experimental science from the collector and transcriber of\r\nothers’ views. His manual of medicine embraces the following subjects:\r\nDiet,[1369] Pathology,[1370] Therapeutics,[1371] Surgery;[1372] and\r\nwithout entering into its peculiar merits, a task which could only be\r\nperformed satisfactorily by a professional writer, the highest testimony\r\nis borne to its merits by the fact of its being used as a text-book even\r\nin the present advanced state of medical science.\r\n\r\nThe study of medicine has a tendency to predispose the mind for general\r\nscientific investigations in other departments not immediately connected\r\nwith it. Hence the medical profession has numbered amongst its members\r\nmany men of general scientific attainments; and Celsus was an example of\r\nthis versatility. The taste of the age in which he lived turned his\r\nattention also to polite literature; and to this may be ascribed the\r\nAugustan purity of his style, which gained for him the appellation of\r\n“Cicero Medicorum.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SCRIBONIUS LARGUS DESIGNATIANUS.\r\n\r\nThe “Cicero of physicians” was followed by Scribonius, an obsequious\r\ncourt physician, in the reign of Claudius. He was the author of several\r\nworks, one of which, a large collection of prescriptions, is extant. In\r\nthe language of impious flattery, he calls the imbecile emperor a god.\r\nHe is said to have accompanied him in his expedition to Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            POMPONIUS MELA.\r\n\r\nPomponius Mela may be considered as the representative of the Roman\r\ngeographers. He was a native of Tingentera, a town in Spain, and lived\r\nin the reign of Claudius. His treatise is entitled, “De Situ Orbis,\r\nLibri iii.” It is systematic and learned. The stores of information\r\nderived from the Greek geographers are interspersed with entertaining\r\nmyths and lively descriptions. The knowledge, however, contained in it\r\nis all taken from books: it is an epitome of former treatises, and is\r\nnot enriched by the discoveries of more recent travellers. The\r\nsimplicity of the style, and the almost Augustan purity of the Latinity,\r\nprevent even so bare a skeleton and list of facts from being dry and\r\nuninteresting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     L. JUNIUS MODERATUS COLUMELLA.\r\n\r\nThe didactic work of Columella gives, in smooth and fluent, though\r\nsomewhat too diffuse, a style, the fullest and completest information on\r\npractical agriculture amongst the Romans, in the first century of the\r\nChristian era. Pliny is the only classical author who mentions him; but\r\nhe refers to him as a competent authority. Columella himself informs us\r\nthat he was born at Gades (Cadiz,[1373]) and resided at Rome,[1374] but\r\nhad travelled in Syria and Cilicia.[1375] It is generally supposed that\r\nhe died and was buried at Tarentum.\r\n\r\nHis work, “_De Re Rusticâ_,” is divided into twelve books. It treats of\r\nall subjects connected with the choice and management of a farm,[1376]\r\nthe arrangement of farm buildings,[1377] the propagation and rearing of\r\nstock,[1378] the cultivation of fruit trees,[1379] and household\r\neconomy.[1380] A calendar is attached to the eleventh book, pointing out\r\nthe cosmical risings and settings of the constellations, which marked\r\nthe successive seasons for various labours and other practical points of\r\nrustic astronomy. The tenth book, the subject of which is horticulture,\r\nis in hexameters. It never rises quite to the height of poetry: it is\r\nrather metrical prose, characterized, like the rest of his work, by\r\nfluency, and also expressed in correct versification. The reason which\r\nhe gives for this variation from his plan is, that it is intended as\r\nsupplementary to the Georgics of Virgil, and that in so doing he is\r\nfollowing the great poet’s own recommendations. In his preface to his\r\nfriend Silvinus he thus expresses his intention:—“Postulatio tua\r\npervicit ut poeticis numeris explerem Georgici carminis omissas partes,\r\nquas tamen et ipse Virgilius significaverat posteris se memorandas\r\nrelinquere.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SEXTUS JULIUS FRONTINUS.\r\n\r\nSex. Jul. Frontinus deserves a place amongst Roman classical writers as\r\nthe author of two works, both of which are still extant. The first,\r\nentitled, “Stratagematicon, Libri iv.,” was a treatise on military\r\ntactics. The form in which he has enunciated his doctrines is that of\r\nprecepts and anecdotes of celebrated military commanders. In this way\r\nthe necessary preparations for a battle, the stratagems resorted to in\r\nfighting, the rules for conducting sieges, and the means of maintaining\r\ndiscipline in an army, are explained and illustrated in a\r\nstraight-forward and soldier-like style.\r\n\r\nAs the object which he had in view in adducing his anecdotes is\r\nscientific illustration rather than historic truth, he is not very\r\nparticular as to the sources from which his examples are derived. It is\r\ninteresting, however, to the antiquarian, if not of practical utility to\r\nthe tactician, as displaying the theory and practice of ancient warfare.\r\nThis subject had in early times been treated of by Cato and Cincius, and\r\nafterwards by Hyginus in a treatise on Field Fortification (_de\r\nCastrametatione_,) and also in the epitome of Vegetius.\r\n\r\nHis other work, which has descended to modern times in a perfect state,\r\nis a descriptive architectural treatise, in two books, on those\r\nwonderful monuments of Roman art, the aqueducts. But besides these,\r\nfragments remain of other works, which assign Frontinus an important\r\nplace in the estimation of the student of Roman history. These are\r\ntreatises on surveying, and the laws and customs relating to landed\r\nproperty. They were partly of a scientific, partly of a jurisprudential\r\ncharacter, and are to be found amongst the works of the _Agri-mensores_,\r\nor _Rei Agrariæ Scriptores_. The difficulty and obscurity of everything\r\nconnected with Roman agrarian institutions is well known; and every\r\nfragment relating to them is valuable, because of the probability of its\r\nthrowing light upon so important a subject. Niebuhr[1381] saw their\r\nvalue, and pronounced that “the fragments of Frontinus were the only\r\nwork amongst the _Agri-mensores_ which can be counted a part of\r\nclassical literature, or which was composed with any legal knowledge.”\r\nThese fragments, therefore, may be taken as a favourable specimen of\r\nthis class of writers, amongst whom were Siculus Flaccus, Argenius\r\nUrbicus, and Hyginus (Grammaticus.)\r\n\r\nOf the life of Frontinus himself very few facts are known. He was city\r\nprætor in the reign of Vespasian,[1382] and succeeded Cerealis as\r\ngovernor of Britain. He made a successful campaign against the\r\nSilures[1383] (S. Wales,) and was succeeded by Agricola, A. D. 78. He\r\nwas subsequently _curator aquarum_,[1384] an office which probably\r\nsuggested the composition of his practical manual on aqueducts. He also\r\nhad a seat in the college of augurs, in which, after his death,[1385] he\r\nwas succeeded by the younger Pliny.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this third epoch a history of Roman classical literature comes to a\r\nclose. In the silver age taste had gradually but surely declined; and\r\nalthough the Roman language and literature shone forth for a time with\r\nclassic radiance in the writings of Persius, Juvenal, Quintilian,\r\nTacitus, and the Plinies, nothing could arrest its fall. In vain\r\nemperors endeavoured to encourage learning by pecuniary rewards and\r\nsalaried professorships: it languished together with the death of\r\nconstitutional freedom, the extinction of patriotism, and the decay of\r\nthe national spirit. Poetry had become declamation. History had\r\ndegenerated either into fulsome panegyric, or the fleshless skeletons of\r\nepitomes; and at length Romans seemed to disdain the use of their native\r\ntongue—that tongue which laborious pains had brought to such a height of\r\npolish and perfection, and wrote in Greek, as they had in the infancy of\r\nthe national literature, when Latin was too rude and imperfect to imbody\r\nthe ideas which they had derived from their Greek instructors.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Hadrian resided long at Athens, and became imbued with a\r\ntaste and admiration for Greek; and thus the literature of Rome became\r\nHellenized. From this epoch the term Classical can no longer be applied\r\nto it, for it did not retain its purity. To Greek influence succeeded\r\nthe still more corrupting one of foreign nations. Even with the death of\r\nNerva the uninterrupted succession of emperors of Roman or Italian birth\r\nceased. Trajan himself was a Spaniard; and after him not only barbarians\r\nof every European race, but even Orientals and Africans were invested\r\nwith the imperial purple. The empire also over which they ruled was an\r\nunwieldy mass of heterogeneous materials. The literary influence of the\r\ncapital was not felt in the distant portions of the Roman dominions.\r\nSchools were established in the very heart of nations just emerging from\r\nbarbarism—at Burdegala (Bourdeaux,) Lugdunum (Lyons,) and Augusta\r\nTrevirorum (Treves;) and, although the blessings of civilization and\r\nintellectual culture were thus distributed far and wide, still literary\r\ntaste, as it filtered through the minds of foreigners, became corrupted,\r\nand the language of the imperial city, exposed to the infectious contact\r\nof barbarous idioms, lost its purity.[1386]\r\n\r\nThe Latin authors of this period were numerous, and many of them were\r\nChristians; but few had taste to appreciate and imitate the literature\r\nof the Augustan age. The brightest stars which illuminated the darkness\r\nwere A. Gellius, L. Apuleius, T. Petronius Arbiter, the learned author\r\nof the Saturnalia; the Christian ethical philosopher, L. Cœlius\r\nLactantius; and that poet, in whom the graceful imagination of classical\r\nantiquity seems to have revived, the flattering and courtly Claudian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n ────────┬────────┬──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────\r\n  B.

Æn. iii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  The religion of Rome furnishes many other traces of Etruscan\r\n  influence:—_ex. gr._, the ceremonies of the augurs and haruspices were\r\n  Etruscan, and the lituus, or augur’s staff, may be seen on old\r\n  Etruscan monuments. The Tuscan Fortune, Nortia, the etymology of whose\r\n  name (ne-verto) coincides with that of the Greek Ἀτροπος (the\r\n  unchangeable,) had the nails, the emblem of necessity, as her device;\r\n  and hence the consul marked the commencement of the year by driving a\r\n  nail.\r\n\r\n  The Roman Hymen, the god of marriage, was Talassius; a fact which\r\n  illustrates one of the incidents in the tradition which Livy (book i.\r\n  c. ix.) adopts respecting the rape of the Sabine virgins.\r\n\r\n  The name Talassius was evidently derived from the Tuscan name Thalna,\r\n  or Talana, by which was designated the Juno Pronuba of the Romans, and\r\n  the Ἡρη τελειά of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  Owing to the existence of the Pelasgian element in Latin, as well as\r\n  in Greek, an affinity can be traced between these languages and the\r\n  Sanscrit in no fewer than 339 Greek and 319 Latin words.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  See Donaldson’s Varron., c. iii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  Leps. de Tab.

In order the better to carry on her\r\n  clandestine plan, she pretends that she has intercourse with a\r\n  supernatural being, who visits her in answer to her invocations. Her\r\n  step-son by accident sees the maiden, and is at first awe-struck,\r\n  thinking that he had beheld a goddess; but, discovering the truth, he\r\n  is captivated with her beauty. A happy marriage, with the consent of\r\n  all parties, concludes the play.\r\n\r\nFootnote 186:\r\n\r\n  De Sen. 50.\r\n\r\nFootnote 187:\r\n\r\n  Act v. scene i.\r\n\r\nFootnote 188:\r\n\r\n  See Plaut.

Casaubon derived the word from\r\n  σιλλαίνειν, to scoff. The probability, however, is that the\r\n  substantive is the root of the verb. The invention of the _Silli_ has\r\n  been ascribed by some to Xenophanes, the philosopher of Colophon. He\r\n  was the author of a didactic poem, and his invectives were directed\r\n  against the absurd and erroneous doctrines of his predecessors. Timon,\r\n  a skeptical philosopher, who lived in the reign of Ptolemy\r\n  Philadelphus, was undoubtedly the author of Silli. Some of these are\r\n  dialogues, in which one of the persons is Xenophanes, whence perhaps\r\n  he was erroneously considered the inventor of this kind of poetry. All\r\n  the Silli of Timon are epic parodies, and their subject a ludicrous\r\n  and skeptical attack on philosophy of every kind. Fragments of Silli\r\n  are preserved by Diogenes, Lucilius, and Chrysostom.—Ad. Alex. Orat.\r\n  See also Brunck’s Analecta, and Suidas _s. vv._ σιλλαίνειν, Τίμων.\r\n\r\nFootnote 278:\r\n\r\n  Hor.

Cato on one of these\r\n  occasions happened to be present, and the spectators were ashamed to\r\n  make their usual demand until he had left the theatre. Martial also\r\n  alludes to this anecdote in one of his epigrams.\r\n\r\nFootnote 327:\r\n\r\n  Hor. Od. ii. i.\r\n\r\nFootnote 328:\r\n\r\n  Plut.

For\r\n  a long time Athens, strong in her pure classic taste, successfully\r\n  resisted this influence; and in the time of Cicero the tastes of the\r\n  two schools were in direct opposition. But the flowers of rhetoric are\r\n  captivating: another generation saw the supremacy of rhetoric at Rome;\r\n  and the days of Petronius Arbiter (Satyr. book ii.) witnessed the\r\n  migration of Asiatic taste to Athens.\r\n\r\nFootnote 812:\r\n\r\n  Cicero tells us (de Orat. i. 57, 58) that Galba, Antony, and Sulpicius\r\n  were ignorant of jurisprudence; that the chief requisites were\r\n  elegance, wit, pathos, &c. For legal knowledge they trusted to\r\n  jurisconsults. In the oration _pro Muræna_, even he himself sneers at\r\n  a technical knowledge of law.\r\n\r\nFootnote 813:\r\n\r\n  Delivered B.
