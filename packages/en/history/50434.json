The narrative provides\r\nas substantial a view of Wellington as is possible within the limits of\r\nmy space, but I hope that readers of my book will be so interested that\r\nthey will go on to the perusal of its companions, for the careers of\r\nNapoleon, Nelson, and Wellington should be studied together. They are\r\nthe three sides of a triangle of which Napoleon is the base.\r\n\r\nThe Duke’s career, when compared to the others, is “a plain,\r\nunvarnished tale,” not altogether devoid of romance, certainly not of\r\nadventure, but lacking in many of the qualities which have endeared\r\nless notable men. It would be obviously untrue to state that Wellington\r\nlacked humanity, but he was certainly deficient in that attractive\r\npersonal magnetism so evident in Nelson. Speaking broadly, he did not\r\nrepose that confidence in his subordinates which was one of the great\r\nsea-captain’s most marked characteristics, and he often said hard\r\nthings of the men under him. Nelson is “the darling Hero of England”;\r\nWellington will always be known as the Iron Duke. If it ever became\r\nthe fashion to canonize military and naval men, Nelson’s nimbus would\r\nbe of rosemary, Wellington’s of steel. The mob never broke the windows\r\nof Merton Place, but it shattered every exposed pane in Apsley House.\r\nThe incident arose from his conscientious opposition to reform, and\r\noccurred in 1831, sixteen years after the battle of Waterloo. A little\r\nover a decade later, an immense mob cheered him as he proceeded up\r\nConstitution Hill. His acknowledgment was to point to the iron shutters\r\nof his house when he reached Hyde Park Corner. They had been put up\r\nafter the bombardment by brickbats, and were never taken down during\r\nhis lifetime.\r\n\r\nIn a way, Wellington is the typical John Bull of our fancy. He gloried\r\nin an open-air life, he enjoyed sport, he was a man wedded to duty,\r\nstern and uncompromising once his mind was made up. We love to imagine\r\nthat the average Briton displays the same characteristics, although\r\nwe know at heart that he does not do so, and that the secret of our\r\nmaterial success as a nation is our extraordinary power of absorption,\r\nof “setting our sail to every passing breeze,” of compromising provided\r\nwe get the best of the bargain.\r\n\r\nThis is how the Duke appeared to a foreigner, the Duchesse de Dino,\r\nTalleyrand’s niece: “He has a very exact memory, and never quotes\r\nincorrectly. He forgets nothing, and exaggerates nothing, and if his\r\nconversation is a little dry and military, it attracts by its fairness\r\nand perfect propriety. His tone is excellent, and no woman has ever\r\nto be on her guard against the turn that the conversation may take.”\r\nIn later years Wellington’s memory failed somewhat. He was invariably\r\nprecise, always a soldier, and never given to what is generally known\r\nas small talk. In a word, he commanded.\r\n\r\nA more intimate and less familiar view of Wellington is afforded us in\r\nthe diary of Benjamin Robert Haydon, who painted the Duke’s portrait\r\nat Walmer Castle in the autumn of 1839. During breakfast, he tells us,\r\n“six dear, healthy, noisy children were brought to the windows. ‘Let\r\nthem in,’ said the Duke, and in they came, and rushed over to him,\r\nsaying, ‘How d’ye do, Duke? How d’ye do, Duke?’ One boy, young Grey,\r\nroared, ‘I want some tea, Duke!’ ‘You shall have it if you promise not\r\nto slop it over me, as you did yesterday.’ Toast and tea were then in\r\ndemand. Three got on one side, and three on the other, and he hugged\r\n’em all. Tea was poured out, and I saw little Grey try to slop it over\r\nthe Duke’s frock coat. Sir Astley [Cooper] said, ‘You did not expect to\r\nsee this.’\r\n\r\n“They all then rushed out on the leads, by the cannon, and after\r\nbreakfast I saw the Duke romping with the whole of them, and one of\r\nthem gave his Grace a tremendous thump. I went round to my bedroom. The\r\nchildren came to the window, and a dear little black-eyed girl began\r\nromping. I put my head out and said, ‘I’ll catch you.’ Just as I did\r\nthis the Duke, who did not see me, put his head out at the door close\r\nto my room, No. 10, which leads to the leads, and said, ‘I’ll catch ye!\r\nHa, ha, I’ve got ye!’ at which they all ran away. He looked at them and\r\nlaughed and went in.”\r\n\r\nThat is a very human picture of the grim warrior when the sword had\r\nbeen put aside for ever and the smoke of battle was cleared. “I hit\r\nhis grand, upright, manly expression,” Haydon adds. “He looked like an\r\neagle of the gods who had put on human shape, and had got silvery with\r\nage and service.... His colour was fresh. All the portraits are too\r\npale.... ’Twas a noble head. I saw nothing of that peculiar expression\r\nof mouth the sculptors give him, bordering on simpering. His colour was\r\nbeautiful and fleshy, his lips compressed and energetic.”\r\n\r\nFrom this passive scene in the evening of his days let us turn to the\r\nmore stirring days of the storming of Badajoz for our final portrait\r\nof the Duke, for it is in the field that we like to remember him.\r\nThe glimpse is afforded us by Robert Blakeney, one of the boy heroes\r\nof the Peninsular War. “I galloped off,” he writes, “to where Lord\r\nWellington had taken his station: this was easily discerned by means of\r\ntwo fireballs shot out from the fortress at the commencement of the\r\nattack, which continued to burn brilliantly along the water-cut which\r\ndivided the 3rd from the other divisions. Near the end of this channel,\r\nbehind a rising mound, were Lord Wellington and his personal staff,\r\nscreened from the enemy’s direct fire, but within range of shells. One\r\nof his staff sat down by his side with a candle to enable the general\r\nto read and write all his communications and orders relative to the\r\npassing events. I stood not far from his lordship. But due respect\r\nprevented any of us bystanders from approaching so near as to enable\r\nus to ascertain the import of the reports which he was continually\r\nreceiving; yet it was very evident that the information which they\r\nconveyed was far from flattering; and the recall on the bugles was\r\nagain and again repeated. But about half-past eleven o’clock an officer\r\nrode up at full speed on a horse covered with foam, and announced the\r\njoyful tidings that General Picton had made a lodgment within the\r\ncastle by escalade, and had withdrawn the troops from the trenches to\r\nenable him to maintain his dearly purchased hold. Lord Wellington was\r\nevidently delighted, but exclaimed, ‘What! abandon the trenches?’ and\r\nordered two regiments of the 5th Division instantly to replace those\r\nwithdrawn. I waited to hear no more, but, admiring the prompt genius\r\nwhich immediately provided for every contingency, I mounted my horse.”\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to enumerate the lengthy list of authorities I\r\nhave consulted in writing this volume, but special mention must be\r\nmade of Professor Oman’s monumental “History of the Peninsular War,”\r\nwhich corrects Napier in many important points. Four volumes have now\r\nbeen published, and I am under obligation to the eminent scholar whose\r\nname appears on the title-pages for his kindness in allowing me to\r\nuse without reserve the labour of many years. The “Cambridge Modern\r\nHistory” (vol. ix.), Rose’s “Napoleon,” Croker’s “Correspondence and\r\nDiaries,” Siborne’s “Waterloo Letters,” the “Lives” of Wellington by\r\nSir Herbert Maxwell, W. H. Maxwell, Gleig, Hooper, Yonge, and many\r\nothers have been laid under contribution, as well as contemporary works\r\nby soldiers who fought with the Iron Duke. As I have endeavoured to let\r\nWellington speak for himself whenever possible, Gurwood’s “Dispatches”\r\nhave been frequently consulted, and for sidelights I have had access\r\nto a large number of volumes of correspondence, autobiography, and\r\nbiography in which he plays a part, however insignificant.\r\n\r\nFinally, I must express the hope that my readers, as they progress over\r\nthe field which I have endeavoured to open up to them, will share the\r\nlove of the strong, silent Man of Duty which has grown upon me as I\r\nhave become more intimate with the story of his life.\r\n\r\n    _The path of duty was the way to glory.\r\n            His work is done.\r\n    But while the races of mankind endure,\r\n    Let his great example stand\r\n    Colossal, seen of every land._\r\n\r\n            HAROLD F. B.

The habitués of London coffee-houses discussed one of\r\nthree things--“The Letters of Junius,” the most remarkable series of\r\npolitical exposures ever penned; the election of the notorious John\r\nWilkes for Middlesex; and the rebellious conduct of the North American\r\ncolonists. On the other side of the Channel the Duc de Choiseul was\r\nskilfully planning ways and means of fanning into a fierce outburst\r\nthe flames of discontent now flickering in the West. To heap coals of\r\nfire on the country which, during the Seven Years’ War (1756-63), had\r\nenforced her claims to Canada and India, would be a triumph worthy\r\nof the statesman who had banished the Jesuits from the hereditary\r\npossessions of Louis XV.\r\n\r\nHad the people who lived in those stirring times been gifted with the\r\npower of penetrating the future, their eyes would have turned in the\r\neventful year of 1769 from the larger stages to the comparatively\r\ninsignificant islands of Corsica and Ireland, for the former was the\r\nbirthplace of Napoleon and the latter of Wellington, and both were born\r\nin 1769.\r\n\r\nThere are other remarkable coincidences connected with the childhood\r\nof Napoleon and Wellington. Their respective fathers were easy-going,\r\nunpractical men, their mothers were women of marked force of character,\r\nleft widows early in life with large families. In addition, the hero of\r\nAusterlitz was the fourth child of Letizia Bonaparte, his conqueror at\r\nWaterloo the fourth son of the Countess of Mornington.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of obscurity is associated with their juvenile days.\r\nAlthough the date of the entrance into the world of “the little\r\nCorporal” is now fairly well established, it was long before historians\r\nceased to discuss it. There is still much uncertainty as to that of\r\nWellington. The Duke was always vague on the point, and celebrated\r\nhis birthday on the 1st May, which is the day following that on which\r\nhe was baptized at St Peter’s, Dublin, presuming the parish register\r\nto be correct.[1] Lady Mornington announced that Arthur was a Mayday\r\nboy, but her nurse as stoutly maintained that the event took place on\r\nthe 6th March. Dangan Castle, West Meath, and Mornington House, Marion\r\nStreet, Dublin, contest the honour of being his birthplace. The witness\r\nfor the country home is the afore-mentioned nurse; a prescription of\r\nthe physician who attended Lady Mornington about the period was sent\r\nto a chemist in Ireland’s capital, and attests the claim of the town\r\nmansion. The matter is not of prime importance, but serves to show the\r\nsomewhat casual habits of a less practical generation than our own.\r\nThe real family name of the Westleys, Wesleys, or Wellesleys--the\r\ndifferent forms were all used--was Colley or Cowley, but the Duke’s\r\ngrandfather inherited the estates of his kinsman, Garret Wesley, on\r\ncondition that he assumed that surname. He became Baron Mornington in\r\n1747. It was the son of this fortunate individual, also a Garret, who\r\nwas created the first Earl of Mornington in the year previous to his\r\nmarriage to the eldest daughter of Viscount Dungannon. They became the\r\nparents of the future Duke of Wellington as well as of several other\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nOf Arthur Wellesley’s scholastic career little can be ascertained\r\nwith certainty. We know that he spent a little while at a preparatory\r\nschool in Chelsea, then a very different place from what it is now, and\r\nthat he and his eldest brother, Lord Wellesley, who had succeeded his\r\nfather on his sire’s death in 1781, were at the same house at Eton.\r\nUnfortunately the two rooms which they occupied are now demolished.\r\nWhile it would be incorrect to call Arthur a dull boy, he certainly\r\ndisplayed little interest in learning. Indeed, his mother was so\r\ncynical regarding his ability, or want of it, that she called him “the\r\nfool of the family.”\r\n\r\nThe dictum that Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton may have\r\nbeen true so far as other officers were concerned, but the younger\r\nWellesley showed not the slightest interest in games. He preferred the\r\nfiddle to cricket, for he inherited his father’s passion for music.\r\n“I was a player on the violin once myself, sir,” he mentioned to an\r\nacquaintance in after years, “but I soon found that fiddling and\r\nsoldiering didn’t agree--so I gave it up, sir! I gave it up!” He was a\r\ngreat admirer of Handel’s compositions.\r\n\r\nOne precious anecdote regarding his life at the famous public school\r\nhas been spared to posterity, and appropriately enough it is a record\r\nof his first serious fight--not with a sword, but with fisticuffs.\r\nRobert Smith, brother of Sydney Smith, the witty divine and essayist,\r\nhappened to be bathing in the river when Wellesley was passing.\r\nPrompted by some evil or jocular spirit the latter picked up a handful\r\nof small stones and began to pelt his fellow student. Smith yelled\r\nthat he would thrash him if he did not stop. Wellesley defiantly dared\r\nhim to do so. The enraged “Bobus” promptly waded out and accepted the\r\nchallenge, which he regretted before many rounds had been fought.\r\n\r\nAlthough Wellesley was by no means of a pugnacious disposition, a\r\nsecond fight, in which he was not victorious, took place during a\r\nholiday spent at the Welsh home of his maternal grandfather, Lord\r\nDungannon. His opponent was a young blacksmith, named Hughes, who lived\r\nto hear of the mighty exploits of the Iron Duke. He was never tired of\r\ntelling how he once conquered the vanquisher of Napoleon. It was his\r\none title to fame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arthur and the Marquis de Pignerol\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Joy]\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Eton, Wellesley was taken to Brussels in 1784 by his\r\nmother, who found the many attractions of London society a heavy tax\r\non a slender purse, for she had removed to the Metropolis on the\r\ndeath of her husband. As her son seemed to take little or no interest\r\nin anything but the army, and as that service was then considered a\r\ndesirable alternative to the Church for the fool of the family, Lady\r\nMornington accepted the offer of some friends to provide for his\r\nmilitary education. Whatever ability her fourth son displayed seems to\r\nhave been less obvious to her than to others, as frequently happens.\r\n“They are all,” she writes with reference to her family, “I think,\r\nendowed with excellent abilities except Arthur, and he would probably\r\nnot be wanting, if only there was more energy in his nature; but he is\r\nso wanting in this respect, that I really do not know what to do with\r\nhim.” However, the youth whom she described as being “food for powder\r\nand nothing more” was packed across the frontier to Angers. She herself\r\nreturned to London in 1785, Wellesley proceeding to the quaint\r\nold town associated with King John of England. Here he had his first\r\nencounter with the French, and there is a celebrated picture showing\r\nhim in conversation with the Marquis of Pignerol.\r\n\r\nPignerol, who presided over an Academy, not exclusively devoted to the\r\ntraining of would-be soldiers as some writers have assumed, was an\r\nengineer officer, and did his best to initiate the Irish lad into some\r\nof the mysteries of the science of war. As his pupil only remained at\r\nAngers for about twelve months, he cannot have learned more than the\r\nrudiments, but he assimilated French with comparative ease. Unlike\r\nNapoleon, who was never happier than when he was poring over military\r\nbooks at Brienne, Wellesley enjoyed much good society. He made the\r\nacquaintance of the Duc de Brissac, who seems to have been a delightful\r\nfoster-father of the scholars, for he frequently entertained them at\r\nhis château. The Duc de Praslin, the Abbé Siéyès, later one of the\r\nFrench Consuls, D’Archambault, Talleyrand’s brother, Jaucourt, who\r\nafterwards became Secretary for Foreign Affairs under Louis XVIII,\r\nwere all on his visiting list. It is quite probable that among his\r\nschoolmates was Chateaubriand, destined to fill an honoured place in\r\nthe world of letters, but of this, said the Duke, he was not absolutely\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nThe British army was not then the skilfully organised fighting-machine\r\nit has since become. Entrance into its ranks as an officer was not\r\ndifficult, provided one had financial support and influence. This\r\nexplains the rapid promotion of Wellesley. At the age of seventeen he\r\nbegan his military career as an ensign in a Foot regiment, his gazette\r\nbeing dated the 7th March 1787. Nine months later he was promoted\r\nlieutenant into the 76th. By successive steps he rose to be captain\r\n(1791), major (1793), lieutenant-colonel (1793), and colonel (1796). A\r\ncolonel at twenty-seven is beyond the dreams of mortal men to-day, and\r\nthis advancement contrasts oddly with the slow progress of Nelson,\r\nWellesley’s great naval contemporary, who had to depend upon his own\r\nunaided merits for promotion. In 1793, six years following his first\r\nappointment, he was placed in command of the 33rd Foot, after having\r\nexperience of the cavalry by serving in both the 12th and 18th Light\r\nDragoons.\r\n\r\nA little influence went a long way in those casual times; there was\r\nnothing so valuable as “a friend at court.” Unlike many aristocratic\r\nnobodies who secured high position, Wellesley afterwards proved his\r\nworth, but he scarcely would have ascended the military ladder with\r\nsuch astonishing quickness had not his brother Richard held office\r\nunder the younger Pitt. Lord Westmorland, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland,\r\nalso took a fancy to him and made him one of his _aides-de-camp_.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, when he was still in his twenty-first year, he entered the\r\nIrish House of Commons as Member of Parliament for Trim, County Meath,\r\na “pocket borough” of the Wellesley family. We are told by Sir Jonah\r\nBarrington, who made his acquaintance some three years later, that\r\nthe young soldier “was then ruddy-faced and juvenile in appearance,\r\nand popular enough among the young men of his age and station. His\r\naddress was unpolished; he occasionally spoke in Parliament, but\r\nnot successfully, and never on important subjects; and evinced no\r\npromise of that unparalleled celebrity and splendour which he has\r\nsince reached, and whereto intrepidity and decision, good luck, and\r\ngreat military science have justly combined to elevate him.” The same\r\nauthority then proceeds to introduce us to Lord Castlereagh, and adds:\r\n“At the period to which I allude, I feel confident nobody could have\r\npredicted that one of those young gentlemen would become the most\r\ncelebrated English general of his era, and the other one of the most\r\nmischievous statesmen and unfortunate ministers that has ever appeared\r\nin modern Europe.[2] However, it is observable that to the personal\r\nintimacy and reciprocal friendship of those two individuals they\r\nmutually owed the extent of their respective elevation and celebrity:\r\nSir Arthur Wellesley never would have had the chief command in Spain\r\nbut for the ministerial manœuvring and aid of Lord Castlereagh; and\r\nLord Castlereagh never could have stood his ground as a minister, but\r\nfor Lord Wellington’s successes.”\r\n\r\nAnother contemporary tells quite a different story of Wellesley’s\r\nability, and as he also heard him in 1793 it is printed here in order\r\nthat the reader may not be prejudiced by Barrington’s opinion. So\r\nmuch is determined by the point-of-view of the witness. The occasion\r\nwas a debate on the perennial question of the Roman Catholics.\r\nCaptain Wellesley’s remarks, we are told, “were terse and pertinent,\r\nhis delivery fluent, and his manner unembarrassed.” Gleig, who was\r\nintimately acquainted with the Duke, says that he “seems to have\r\nspoken but rarely, and never at any length. His votes were of course\r\ngiven in support of the party to which he belonged, but otherwise he\r\nentered very little into the business of the House.” He mentions but\r\none incident connected with this period, namely, Wellesley’s attachment\r\nto the Hon. Catherine Pakenham, an acknowledged Society beauty and a\r\ndaughter of Baron Longford. His Lordship, possessing a keen eye for the\r\npractical affairs of life, objected to the match on the score of lack\r\nof money, but there is little doubt that the couple came to a mutual\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThat Wellesley took more than a casual interest in his military\r\nduties is evident, and if he did not display the inherent genius of\r\nNapoleon he certainly went about his duties in a highly commendable and\r\nworkmanlike manner. For instance, he had scarcely donned the uniform\r\nof his first regiment before he entered into calculations regarding\r\nthe weight of the accoutrements, ammunition, and other paraphernalia\r\ncarried by a private when in marching order. For this purpose he\r\nordered a soldier to be weighed both with and without his trappings.\r\n\r\n“I wished,” he says, “to have some measure of the power of the\r\nindividual man compared with the weight he was to carry and the work\r\nhe was expected to do. I was not so young as not to know that since I\r\nhad undertaken a profession I had better endeavour to understand it.”\r\nHe adds, “It must always be kept in mind that the power of the greatest\r\narmies depends upon what the individual soldier is capable of doing\r\nand bearing,” a maxim which still holds good, notwithstanding the many\r\nchanges effected in the course of a century and a quarter. However\r\nexcellent the gun, it is the man behind it which determines the issue.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1794 that Wellesley underwent the hardships of active\r\nservice. Before that phase of his career is detailed we must make a\r\nhasty and general survey of the wide and scattered field of action.\r\nThe occasion was the second year of the great strife which occupied\r\nthe attention of Europe, with little intermittance, for over twenty\r\nyears. The gauntlet had been flung down by France in 1792, when war was\r\ndeclared against the Holy Roman Empire, with which Prussia made common\r\ncause. The campaign was an eye-opener to all Europe, for although\r\nthe Prussians and Austrians began well they did not follow up their\r\nadvantages, particularly when the road to Châlons and Paris lay open\r\nto the former. At Valmy the Prussians were defeated, and subsequently\r\nwithdrew across the frontier in a deplorable condition of dearth and\r\ndisease. Dumouriez then invaded Flanders, and was victorious over the\r\nAustrians at Jemappes, a success followed by the fall of Mons, Malines,\r\nGhent, Brussels, Antwerp, and Namur, while smaller towns, such as\r\nTournay, Ostend, and Bruges welcomed the victorious troops with open\r\narms as the heralds of a new era.\r\n\r\nIn Savoy the scanty Sardinian forces were routed by Montesquiou, and\r\nthe country annexed, as was Nice by Anselme. With the dawning of 1793\r\nBelgium shared a similar fate, and the occupation of Dutch territory\r\nwas decided on. This latter was an extremely foolish move, as events\r\nsoon proved.\r\n\r\nEngland and Holland became involved in the second month of the new\r\nyear, when the French Convention announced hostile intentions to\r\nboth Powers. Previous to this, Great Britain had maintained a strict\r\nneutrality. She now commenced proceedings by sending 10,000 troops to\r\nHolland under the incompetent Duke of York, where they united with a\r\nsimilar force of Hessians and Hanoverians, whose expenses were met by\r\nEnglish gold, a plentiful supply of which also found its way into the\r\ncoffers of other Powers. The Island Kingdom and Russia had already\r\nallied themselves, although the Czarina’s designs on Poland precluded\r\nimmediate co-operation, and during the next few months Sardinia, Spain,\r\nNaples, Prussia, the Holy Roman Empire, and Portugal joined in mutual\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nDumouriez duly appeared on Dutch territory, but was compelled to\r\nretreat on Flanders by the defeat of the general engaged in besieging\r\nMaestricht. On resuming offensive operations he himself lost the\r\nbattle of Neerwinden. Within a fortnight the French had abandoned all\r\ntheir conquests in Belgium, which again passed into the possession of\r\nAustria. Dumouriez took refuge in the camp of the Imperialists after\r\nnegotiating with Coburg, the commander of the “White Coats,” to place\r\nthe frontier fortresses into his hands and to unite the two armies.\r\nNeither arrangement was carried through, for the defeated general\r\nfound it more prudent to fly the country.[3] Mayence, on the Rhine,\r\nwas invested by the Prussians, to whom it eventually capitulated, and\r\nValenciennes and Condé were successfully besieged by the Austrians and\r\nBritish. All three fortresses fell during July 1793.\r\n\r\nThe tide was beginning to turn even in France, for Toulon and Lyons\r\nopenly revolted, and civil war broke out in La Vendée. Had the Allies\r\nmade a concerted effort, the defeat of the Republican cause could\r\nscarcely have failed to follow, but they quarrelled amongst themselves\r\ninstead of following up their advantage. They squandered their strength\r\nby dividing their army into detachments, and much precious time was\r\nwasted by the diversion on Dunkirk made by the English, Hanoverian,\r\nHessian, and some of the Austrian forces, about 37,000 strong.\r\n\r\nThe Revolutionary Government, augmenting its fighting body, instructed\r\nGeneral Houchard to attack the enemy before the historic seaport. As\r\na sequel to this movement the Duke of York was forced to retreat and\r\nabandon forty guns and much of his baggage. Houchard’s triumph was\r\nshort-lived. He met with disaster at the hands of the Austrians, and\r\npaid the price of failure with his head. With the Convention defeat\r\nspelt death. Professing the Cause of Humanity, it refused to be\r\nhumanitarian.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of September all the important fortresses which blockaded\r\nthe way of the Allies to the Capital had fallen, with the exception\r\nof Maubeuge. The victory of Jourdan, the successor of Houchard, over\r\nthe covering force at Wattignies saved the situation, and on the\r\n17th October the French marched into Maubeuge. On the Upper Rhine\r\nthe Allies found themselves in possession of Metz only, at the end\r\nof 1793. In the south-west of Europe the campaign made no further\r\nprogress, and the Republican cause gained fresh impetus by the crushing\r\nof the royalist risings at Lyons and Toulon. It will be remembered\r\nthat Napoleon won his first laurels in helping to subjugate the great\r\narsenal in the south of France, and in forcing the withdrawal of the\r\nBritish fleet under Hood which had gone to support the rebellious\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThese facts, dry as dust though they may be, are essential to a correct\r\nunderstanding of the part played by Wellington in the early days of the\r\nGreat War detailed in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWellington’s Baptism of Fire\r\n\r\n(1794-97)\r\n\r\n  “_I learnt what one ought not to do, and that is always something._”\r\n\r\n            WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pages of military romance teem with references to the disappointed\r\nlover who seeks to assuage his sorrow by active service. In actual\r\nlife one doubts whether such things often happen, but it appears that\r\nit was true of Arthur Wellesley. He asked his eldest brother to use\r\nhis influence with Pitt to persuade Lord Westmorland to send him “as\r\nmajor to one of the flank corps,” his own regiment being “the last\r\nfor service.” The request was refused, and the young officer had to\r\nwait until May 1794. Orders were then issued for the 33rd to proceed\r\non foreign service as part of a contingent under Lord Moira which was\r\nurgently required to reinforce the Duke of York.\r\n\r\nThe Allies had not only experienced a series of defeats, but Prussia\r\nhad withdrawn many of her forces on the Rhine for service in Poland,\r\nthe dismemberment of which seemed to offer more tangible advantages\r\nthan the protracted warfare against “armed opinions.” As a member of\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire she had of necessity to supply 20,000 troops--a\r\nmere handful--and she announced her intention of merely fulfilling\r\nthis obligation. Again British gold came to the rescue, and Prussia,\r\nby a treaty signed on the 19th April 1794, agreed to keep 62,000 men\r\nat the disposal of the Allies in return for a handsome subsidy. The\r\nunfortunate Austrian general, Mack, was then given command of the new\r\ncampaign. The fatal mistake was repeated of dividing the army, with\r\nthe result that while the Imperialists under Clerfait were forced to\r\nretreat on Tournay, the Duke of York, aided by Prince Schwartzenberg,\r\nsecured an advantage at Troisville. A series of actions around\r\nTourcoing followed on the 16th to the 18th May, during which his\r\nHighness narrowly escaped being made a prisoner, owing partly to his\r\nhaving been left isolated by the cutting off of his communications,\r\nand partly to a praiseworthy determination to hold the positions his\r\ntroops had gained. At Pont-à-chin, near Tournay, the repeated attempts\r\nof Pichegru to secure the village ended in disaster. On the 26th June\r\nthe Austrians, in their endeavour to relieve Charleroi, which had\r\nsurrendered to the growing forces of the French under Jourdan a few\r\nhours before, were forced to retreat from the plains of Fleurus. “The\r\nloss of Flanders,” says Alison, “immediately followed a contest which\r\nan enterprizing general would have converted into the most decisive\r\ntriumph.” The Duke of York, having sustained a reverse at Oudenarde,\r\nwas also retreating, intent upon covering Antwerp and Holland.\r\n\r\nWellesley arrived at Ostend with his regiment in June 1794, from whence\r\nhe was sent to Antwerp, on which the Duke of York and the Prince of\r\nOrange shortly afterwards fell back, while Moira marched to Malines.\r\nThe Colonel held that his senior officer would have been better advised\r\nhad he and his troops proceeded up the Scheldt or the Maes in boats, an\r\nopinion subsequently confirmed by events.\r\n\r\nAfter settling necessary matters Wellesley carried out his instructions\r\nand reached the Duke of York several days before Moira was in touch\r\nwith him. It was a moral victory for the young officer, and doubtless\r\nserved the very useful purpose of stimulating his ambition.\r\n\r\nFor three months the Duke of York and the Prince of Orange remained\r\nat Antwerp. The Commander of the Dutch troops then retired towards\r\nthe Rhine, and the former moved towards Holland. During the march\r\nGeneral Abercromby was told to secure the village of Boxtel, captured\r\non the previous evening by one of Pichegru’s divisions. A desperate\r\naffray ensued, and notwithstanding the intrepid bravery of the British\r\ninfantry, cavalry, and artillery, it ended in disaster. It is extremely\r\nprobable that the entire force would have been annihilated but for\r\nWellesley’s promptitude in covering the retreat. No opposition was\r\noffered until the British were passing through a wood, when a masked\r\nbattery opened fire. A little later there was considerable confusion,\r\nand a body of French Hussars charged forward only to meet Wellesley’s\r\nbattalion drawn across the road. They were repulsed, thanks to the\r\nvalour of the young commander.\r\n\r\nThroughout an extremely severe winter the British were continually\r\npressed by the ardent Republicans. From October to January 1795\r\nWellesley held a post on the Waal, and the arduous nature of his duties\r\nis described by him in letters written at the time. “At present,” he\r\nsays on the 20th December 1794, “the French keep us in a perpetual\r\nstate of alarm; we turn out once, sometimes twice, every night; the\r\nofficers and men are harassed to death, and if we are not relieved,\r\nI believe there will be very few of the latter remaining shortly. I\r\nhave not had the clothes off my back for a long time, and generally\r\nspend the greatest part of the night upon the bank of the river,\r\nnotwithstanding which I have entirely got rid of that disorder which\r\nwas near killing me at the close of the summer campaign. Although\r\nthe French annoy us much at night, they are very entertaining during\r\nthe daytime; they are perpetually chattering with our officers and\r\nsoldiers,[4] and dance the _carmagnol_ upon the opposite bank whenever\r\nwe desire them; but occasionally the spectators on our side are\r\ninterrupted in the middle of a dance by a cannon ball from theirs.”\r\n\r\nIt is a genial, good-natured message, but Wellesley always held his\r\nfeelings well under control. In the above he chose to reveal the\r\nhumorous aspect of the long-drawn-out agony. There was plenty to\r\ncomplain about had he desired. The food supply was deficient; the\r\nwounded had to bear their agonies with the patience of Stoics, because\r\nthe stock of medicines ran short; and the general privation was\r\nterrible. A pitiful lack of foresight characterised the whole campaign.\r\nWhat could be expected of a Commander-in-Chief who gave preference to\r\nthe pleasures of the table if a dispatch arrived during a meal, and\r\ncontemptuously remarked, “That will keep till the morning”? During the\r\ntime of his sojourn on the Waal, Wellesley “only saw once one general\r\nfrom the headquarters,[5] which was old Sir David Dundas.... We had\r\nletters from England, and I declare that those letters told us more of\r\nwhat was passing at headquarters than we learnt from the headquarters\r\nourselves.... It has always been a marvel to me how any of us escaped.”\r\n\r\nThat “old Sir David Dundas” thought very highly of the young officer’s\r\nconduct is evident. When he succeeded as Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nBritish forces, on the recall of the Duke of York in the following\r\nDecember, Wellesley was appointed Brigadier and given command of the\r\nrear guard. By a series of retreats the tattered army eventually\r\nreached Bremen. It embarked for England early in 1795.\r\n\r\nIn summing up Wellesley’s first experience of field service, Earl\r\nRoberts states that it was, “no doubt, extremely valuable to\r\nWellington in after years. It must have taught him that soldiers even\r\nof the best quality, well drilled, disciplined and equipped, cannot\r\nhope to be successful unless proper arrangements are made for their\r\nsupply and transport; and unless those who direct the operations have\r\nformed some definite plan of action, and have sufficient zeal and\r\nprofessional knowledge to carry it out. If the French generals had\r\ntaken full advantage of the opportunities which the incapacity of the\r\nEnglish and German commanders threw in their way, the British force\r\nmust have been annihilated.”\r\n\r\nOne is inclined to doubt whether the troops were “well drilled,\r\ndisciplined and equipped” at this period. The gross incompetence of\r\nmany of the highest officers is abundantly proved, and continued lack\r\nof success speedily reduces the vital strength of any regiment.\r\n\r\nAs already noted, the commissariat was execrable. We have it on the\r\nauthority of one who was present that during the retreat hundreds of\r\ninvalids succumbed, “whilst the shameful neglect that then pervaded\r\nthe medical department, rendered the hospitals nothing better than\r\nslaughter-houses for the wounded and the sick.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The full force of the blast”\r\n\r\nThomas Maybank]\r\n\r\nShortly after Wellesley reached England he decided to leave the Army.\r\nThe cause is unknown, but it seems highly probable that either his\r\nrecent experience had disgusted him with the service as constituted, or\r\nhe wished to obtain more remunerative employment so that he might be\r\nin a position to marry the lady of his choice. He also owed money to\r\nhis brother, who had made advances for his promotion. This sum could\r\nbe repaid by the sale of his commission. Although Wellesley was always\r\nscrupulous in money matters, the reason seems scarcely credible. We\r\nare therefore forced to accept one of the other alternatives, perhaps\r\nboth, for mention is made of the miserable state of the Army in\r\nhis letter to Lord Camden[6] regarding the desired appointment. He\r\nconsulted Mornington on the matter, and it was decided that a position\r\nunder the Revenue or Treasury Boards would serve his purpose. “If your\r\nExcellency,” he writes to the Viceroy, “is of opinion that the offices\r\nat these boards are too high for me, of course you will say so; and\r\nas I am convinced that no man is so bad a judge of a claim as he who\r\nmakes it, I trust you will not believe that I shall feel otherwise\r\ntowards you than as I have always felt, with sentiments of the greatest\r\nregard.... You will probably be surprised at my desiring a civil\r\ninstead of a military office. It is certainly a departure from the line\r\nwhich I prefer, but I see the manner in which the military offices are\r\nfilled, and I don’t want to ask you for that which I know you cannot\r\ngive me.”\r\n\r\nResearch has failed to discover what answer, if any, was vouchsafed\r\nthis communication. Wellesley remained in the Army. In October 1795\r\nhe and his regiment sailed from Southampton as part of an expedition\r\nagainst the French settlements in the West Indies. The vessels\r\nencountered a terrible gale, still known as “Christian’s Storm,” after\r\nthe name of the admiral who commanded the fleet. While it might be\r\nuntrue to say that the ships were in an unseaworthy condition, their\r\nsanitary state was deplorable, for they had but recently returned from\r\na long voyage as hospital and prison transports. Scarcely forty-eight\r\nhours after they had sailed, and when they were off Weymouth, the full\r\nforce of the blast struck them. One vessel foundered with all hands,\r\nhalf-a-dozen or more were totally dismasted, and hundreds of soldiers\r\nwent to their death in a battle with the elements against which all the\r\ndrill in the world was ineffectual. Fortunately Wellesley escaped, but\r\nwhen he received orders, in April 1796, to embark his men for India he\r\nwas too ill to accompany them. However, he set sail for Calcutta in\r\nJune, and overtaking the 33rd Regiment at the Cape of Good Hope, duly\r\nreached his destination in February 1797. “The station is so highly\r\nadvantageous to him that I could not advise him to decline it,” says\r\nLord Mornington.[7] The good-natured Earl little knew what advantage,\r\nboth to Wellesley and the Empire, was to accrue as the result of the\r\nfailure of his brother’s civil ambitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe Campaign of Seringapatam\r\n\r\n(1797-1800)\r\n\r\n  _India, “a country fertile in heroes and statesmen._”\r\n\r\n            CANNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proverb to the effect that “History repeats itself” is not strictly\r\ntrue. The further we study the subject, the more we find that like\r\ncauses do not necessarily bring about similar effects. The ill success\r\nwhich attended the expedition to the West Indies, ere it left the\r\nEnglish Channel, has a fitting parallel so far as its practical utility\r\nis concerned in the force placed at General St Leger’s disposal to\r\nattack Manilla, the Philippine Islands then being in the possession of\r\nSpain, with whom Great Britain was now at war. Fortunately it did not\r\nmeet with disaster, but neither expedition reached its destination.\r\nWellesley accepted the offer of Sir John Shore, the Governor-General\r\nof India, to command a brigade, and the troops were embarked. They had\r\nnot proceeded farther than Penang before an order was issued for their\r\nrecall owing to troubles brewing in India itself.\r\n\r\nShortly after his return to Calcutta the Colonel was placed in command\r\nof the forces in Madras. He also heard that his eldest brother\r\nhad been offered the extremely responsible and difficult post of\r\nGovernor-General in succession to Sir John Shore. It was now his turn\r\nto feed the flames of Mornington’s ambition. He writes: “I strongly\r\nadvise you to come out. I am convinced that you will retain your\r\nhealth; nay, it is possible that its general state may be improved,\r\nand you will have the fairest opportunity of rendering material\r\nservice to the public and of doing yourself credit.” Mornington lacked\r\nself-confidence, and a thousand and one doubts and fears possessed his\r\nmind. The Colonel reminded him that if he refused so advantageous a\r\nposition on account of his young family, “you forego both for yourself\r\nand them what will certainly be a material and lasting advantage.”\r\n\r\nMornington accepted, and arrived at Calcutta with his youngest brother,\r\nHenry, as private secretary in the middle of May 1798. He speedily\r\nfound an antidote for home-sickness in endeavouring to unravel the\r\ntangled skein of affairs in Mysore, where Tipú Sultan was intriguing\r\nwith the French Republic for assistance in attacking the possessions\r\nof the East India Company in Southern India. The pugnacious character\r\nof the son of Hyder Ali was typified by the tiger’s stripes on his\r\nflag. He possessed the fanaticism and barbarity of the Oriental at his\r\nworst, and when opportunity occurred would feed a beast of prey with an\r\nEnglish prisoner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELLINGTON’S CAMPAIGN IN INDIA.]\r\n\r\nTo secure either the friendship or the neutrality of the Nizám,\r\nwhose territory abutted that of the bloodthirsty Tipú, now became of\r\nparamount importance. His army was officered by Frenchmen, which was\r\nproof positive that in the event of war it would assist Britain’s\r\nenemy, although the Nizám had a distinct leaning towards the English.\r\nAs it happened, the native troops mutinied against their officers,\r\nand, seizing his opportunity, the Nizám dismissed them. They were sent\r\nto England as prisoners, and subsequently allowed to return to their\r\nown country, a most humane consideration, for which Mornington was\r\nlargely responsible. The military positions they formerly occupied\r\nwere promptly filled by our own officers. A new treaty was made to\r\npreclude the Marhattás from allying themselves with Tipú, and a force\r\nof 6000 British troops was maintained by the Nizám at Hyderabad.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Wellesley had proceeded with his regiment to Madras, and,\r\nowing to the death of the senior officer, was placed in temporary\r\ncommand of the troops. In communication with Lord Clive, the Governor\r\nof the Presidency, and General Harris, the Commander-in-Chief, he\r\nbusied himself with the multitudinous arrangements necessary for\r\nan advance upon Seringapatam, the capital of the Mysore Dominions.\r\nHorses, bullocks, and elephants had to be provided for the purpose of\r\ntransport; forts equipped and provisioned; the siege train properly\r\norganized. He drew up a plan of campaign, and bent himself to the task\r\nwith exacting energy. Notwithstanding the preparations for war, he\r\nstill hoped that a resort to arms would prove unnecessary. Those who\r\nare apt to think that all military men delight in strife for the mere\r\nlove of it will do well to remember this fact and judge less harshly,\r\nfor Wellington is the typical representative of the British Army. But\r\nhe believed in being ready, and hated nothing so much as “muddling\r\nthrough.”\r\n\r\nThere was still a possibility, though scarcely a probability, that Tipú\r\nwould repent. He had received word that Napoleon, then on his famous\r\nEgyptian expedition, was coming to his aid with an “invincible army.”\r\nSo far he had refused a definite statement of policy. Not until it was\r\nabundantly evident that the protracted negotiations of the Sultan of\r\nMysore with the Government were merely to gain time, was a declaration\r\nof war issued on the 22nd February 1799. According to Wellesley,\r\nGeneral Harris “expressed his approbation of what I had done, and\r\nadopted as his own all the orders and regulations I had made, and then\r\nsaid that he should mention his approbation publicly, only that he was\r\nafraid others would be displeased and jealous. Now as there is nothing\r\nto be got in the army except credit, and as it is not always that the\r\nbest intentions and endeavours to serve the public succeed, it is hard\r\nthat when they do succeed they should not receive the approbation which\r\nit is acknowledged by all they deserve. I was much hurt about it at the\r\ntime, but I don’t care now, and shall certainly do everything to serve\r\nGeneral Harris, and to support his name and authority.”\r\n\r\nWellesley never feared to speak his mind, as his voluminous dispatches\r\nabundantly testify. In a letter to Mornington he admits that he had\r\n“lectured” the Commander-in-Chief because he allowed the Madras\r\nMilitary Board too much license in the matter of appointments. On the\r\nother hand, he had “urged publicly to the army (in which I flatter\r\nmyself I have some influence) the necessity of supporting him, whether\r\nhe be right or wrong.” In his opinion it was “impossible” to hold the\r\nGeneral “too high, if he is to be the head of the army in the field.”\r\n\r\nHarris certainly compensated Wellesley to some extent by placing him\r\nin command of thirteen regiments, including the Nizám’s contingent,\r\nwith the rank of brigadier. The strength of this force was about 16,000\r\nmen, that of the whole army 35,000, excluding 120,000 camp followers,\r\nthe bugbear of the old-time commander. The Bombay corps under General\r\nStuart attacked a portion of the enemy, commanded by the wily Tipú, in\r\nthe vicinity of Sedasser, on the 6th March. This success augured well,\r\nfor the Sultan was forced to retire.\r\n\r\nHarris’s first serious engagement took place near Malavelly on the\r\n27th, Wellesley advancing to the attack and turning Tipú’s right flank.\r\nAfter an engagement lasting three hours the enemy withdrew, with the\r\nloss of some 2000 men by death or wounds against the British 7 killed\r\nand 53 wounded. Tipú was a skilful soldier, and had not neglected to\r\nthrow up a line of entrenchments before Seringapatam, into which city\r\nhe now withdrew. To drive in the advanced outposts before definitely\r\nbesieging the place was Harris’s first object. This duty was intrusted\r\nto Wellesley and Colonel Shaw respectively, each having charge of a\r\ndetachment. It was the task of the former to carry a tope, or thicket,\r\nand a village called Sultanpettah. He failed, for reasons explained in\r\nthe following letter:\r\n\r\n“On the night of the 5th, we made an attack on the enemy’s outposts,\r\nwhich, at least on my side, was not quite so successful as could have\r\nbeen wished. The fact is, that the night was very dark, that the\r\nenemy expected us, and were strongly posted in an almost impenetrable\r\njungle. We lost an officer, killed, and nine men of the 33rd wounded,\r\nand at last, as I could not find out the post which it was desirable\r\nI should occupy, I was obliged to desist from the attack, the enemy\r\nalso having retired from the post. In the morning they re-occupied it,\r\nand we attacked it again at day-light, and carried it with ease and\r\nwith little loss. I got a slight touch on the knee, from which I have\r\nfelt no inconvenience, and I have come to the determination never to\r\nsuffer an attack to be made by night upon an enemy who was prepared\r\nand strongly posted, and whose posts had not been reconnoitred by\r\ndaylight.” It should be added that twelve soldiers were taken prisoner\r\nand executed by the brutal method of nails being driven through their\r\nheads, and that Wellesley had previously given it as his opinion that\r\nthe projected attack on the thicket would be a mistake. The operation\r\nundertaken by Colonel Shaw was successful.\r\n\r\nThe siege now proceeded in earnest, but a breach was not made in the\r\nsolid walls surrounding Seringapatam for three days. On the 4th May the\r\nplace was stormed by General Baird. General Sherbrooke’s right column\r\nwas the first to ford the Cauvery River. His men speedily scaled the\r\nramparts, and engaged that part of the Sultan’s 22,000 troops stationed\r\nin the immediate vicinity. The defenders fought with the fatalistic\r\nenergy and determination so characteristic of the natives of India. The\r\nleft column followed, but found the way more difficult. Tipú, mounting\r\nthe ramparts, fired at the oncoming red-coats with muskets handed to\r\nhim by his attendants. It was his last battle; his body was afterwards\r\ndiscovered in a covered gateway, together with hundreds of others.\r\nWellesley, with his corps, occupied the trenches as a first reserve.\r\n\r\n“About a quarter past one p.m.,” says an eye-witness, “as we were\r\nanxiously peering, telescope in hand, at the ford, and the intermediate\r\nground between our batteries and the breach, a sharp and sudden\r\ndischarge of musquetry and rockets, along the western face of the\r\nfort, announced to us that General Baird and the column of assault\r\nwere crossing the ford; and immediately afterwards, we perceived our\r\nsoldiers, in rather loose array, rushing towards the breach. The\r\nmoment was one of agony; and we continued, with aching eyes, to watch\r\nthe result, until, after a short and appalling interval, we saw the\r\nacclivity of the breach covered with a cloud of crimson,--and in a\r\nvery few minutes afterwards, observing the files passing rapidly to\r\nthe right and left at the summit of the breach, I could not help\r\nexclaiming, ‘Thank God! the business is done.’\r\n\r\n“The firing continued in different parts of the place until about two\r\no’clock, or a little afterwards; when, the whole of the works being\r\nin the possession of our troops, and the St George’s ensign floating\r\nproudly from the flagstaff of the southern cavalier, announced to us\r\nthat the triumph was completed.”\r\n\r\nOn the 5th, Wellesley took over the command from Baird, who had\r\nrequested temporary leave of absence, and without delay began to\r\nrestore some kind of order among the British troops, whose one object\r\nafter victory was plunder, in which matter they showed little delicacy\r\nof feeling. The city was on fire in several places, but the flames\r\nwere all extinguished within twenty-four hours, and the inhabitants\r\nwere “retiring to their homes fast.” Having stopped, “by hanging,\r\nflogging, etc.,” the insubordination of the troops and the rifling of\r\nthe dead by the camp followers who had flocked in, Wellesley proceeded\r\nto bury those who had fallen.\r\n\r\nDuring the four weeks of the siege the British lost 22 officers and\r\n310 men, and no fewer than 45 officers and 1164 men were reported as\r\nwounded and missing.[8] The Commander mentions that jewels of the\r\ngreatest value, and bars of gold, were obtained. As the prize agents\r\nassessed the treasure taken at £1,143,216, the wealth of Seringapatam\r\nmust have been astounding. Wellesley’s share came to about £4000.[9]\r\nHundreds of animals were required to carry the rich stuffs, plate,\r\nand richly-bound books from this city of opulence. A little humorous\r\nrelief to so much sordidness is afforded by Wellesley’s difficulties\r\nregarding some of the late Sultan’s pets. “There are some tigers here,”\r\nhe writes, “which I wish Meer Allum would send for, or else I must give\r\norders to have them shot, as there is no food for them, and nobody to\r\nattend to them, and they are getting violent.” Tipú’s 650 wives gave\r\nless trouble than the wild beasts. They were removed to a remote region\r\nand set at liberty.\r\n\r\nWellesley’s next appointment was as Commander of the Forces in Mysore.\r\nHe proved himself to be particularly well fitted for the post, which\r\nobviously required a man of infinite tact, who could be lenient or\r\nsevere as circumstances demanded. It was Wellesley’s testing-time, and\r\nhe did not fail either in administration or the rough and tumble of\r\nthe “little war” so soon to fall to his lot. He had already served on\r\na commission appointed to go into the question of the partition of the\r\nconquered Dominions, a small part of which was made over to the Peshwá,\r\nand larger shares to the Nizám and the East India Company respectively.\r\nThe dynasty overturned by Tipú’s father was restored. As the new\r\nRájá of Mysore was only five years of age, he was scarcely able to\r\nappreciate the fact that his territory was so greatly diminished.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a story worthy of a place in the Arabian Nights. It\r\nconcerns an adventurer who, later, assumed the truly regal title of\r\nKing of the World. Dhoondia Waugh, to give him the name by which those\r\nwho were unfortunate enough to make his acquaintance first knew him,\r\nwas the chief of a band of robbers whom Tipú had captured and thrown\r\ninto prison. Recognizing in him a brave man, the Sultan remitted the\r\nsentence of death and gave him a military appointment, thus turning his\r\nacknowledged abilities into a less questionable channel, for a thief\r\nmust needs be fearless and daring if he is to succeed. For some reason\r\nnot altogether clear, Dhoondia Waugh was again imprisoned, and he did\r\nnot regain his liberty until the fall of Seringapatam, when he was\r\nliberated, together with a number of other gaol-birds. The old thieving\r\ninstinct reasserted itself, and as he encountered no difficulty in\r\ncollecting a band of the late Tipú’s cavalry, he speedily resorted to\r\nmeans and measures which alarmed the inhabitants of every place he\r\nvisited. When pressed by the troops sent after them the horde took\r\nrefuge in the territory of the Peshwá, the nominal head of the Marhattá\r\nconfederacy. There they received anything but a cordial welcome,\r\nalthough it seems probable that reinforcements were obtained among\r\nthe malcontents. However that may be, Dhoondia Waugh duly appeared\r\nnear Savanore. Having the safety of the Mysore Dominions very much at\r\nheart, for he had supreme civil and military control, Wellesley started\r\nin pursuit of the freebooter. Several fortresses held by Dhoondia’s\r\nunlawful bands were stormed, his baggage taken, and a number of guns\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\nAn affray which took place near the Malpurda River at the end of\r\nJuly 1800, not only reduced the chief’s forces, but caused many of\r\nhis followers to forsake the cause, although their strength in the\r\nfollowing September was considerably more than that at Wellesley’s\r\ncommand; in actual figures, some 5000 against 1200. The operation on\r\nthe 10th of that month, which proved decisive, was extremely difficult,\r\nfor the enemy was strongly posted at a village called Conahgull. The\r\nColonel charged with such cool daring and so determined a front, that\r\nafter having stood firm for some time the enemy made off, closely\r\npursued for many miles by the British cavalry. A dire and just\r\nretribution was exacted; those who were not killed “were scattered in\r\nsmall parties over the face of the country.” The King of the World had\r\nfought his last battle. He was found among the slain.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently asserted that Wellesley held but a low opinion of\r\nthe troops which he commanded, and he certainly passed harsh judgment\r\non those who shared his later campaigns. Not so in this particular\r\ninstance, however. In the dispatch detailing “the complete defeat and\r\ndispersion” of the forces of Dhoondia, he expressly remarks on the\r\n“determined valour and discipline” of the soldiers, the patience and\r\nperseverance displayed in “a series of fatiguing services,” and the\r\nexcellent organization of the commissariat department.\r\n\r\nWellesley also showed that a kind heart is not necessarily the\r\nattribute of a weak nature. With a humanity entirely worthy so great\r\na man, he had Dhoondia’s “supposed or adopted son” cared for, and\r\nafterwards placed £400 in the hands of trustees for his future\r\nuse.[10] “Had you and your regicide army been out of the way,” writes\r\nSir Thomas Munro to Wellesley, “Dhoondia would undoubtedly have become\r\nan independent and powerful prince, and the founder of a new dynasty of\r\ncruel and treacherous Sultauns.”\r\n\r\nThis short campaign likewise furnishes us with one of the secrets of\r\nthe success of our national military hero. Just before he set out on\r\nthe long chase after the King of the World, he was offered a position\r\nparticularly rich in prospects, namely, the military command of an\r\nexpedition for the surrender of the Dutch island of Batavia. The sole\r\ncondition was that Lord Clive, the Governor of Madras, to whom he was\r\nresponsible, could spare him. A man who was moved by purely personal\r\nambition would have had no hesitation in bringing all his influence to\r\nbear on the Governor in order to secure so good an opening. Wellesley,\r\nhowever, recognizing that he had already begun preparations for the\r\nrunning to earth of the bloodthirsty and cruel Dhoondia--an end much\r\nto be desired--asked Clive to accept or decline for him as he thought\r\nbest. He neither pleaded for nor against, although he hoped that if\r\nAdmiral Rainier were not starting at once he might be able to join him\r\nwhen the work on hand was finished. “I am determined that nothing shall\r\ninduce me to desire to quit this country, until its tranquillity is\r\nensured. The general want of troops, however, at the present moment,\r\nand the season, may induce the Admiral to be desirous to postpone the\r\nexpedition till late in the year. In that case it may be convenient\r\nthat I should accompany him....”\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Madras refused his permission, and there the matter\r\nended. Months afterwards, when there seemed a probability of operations\r\nin the Marhattá Territory, Wellesley wrote a lengthy Memorandum on\r\nthe means of carrying such a campaign to a successful issue. “The\r\nexperience,” he notes in his opening remarks, “which has been acquired\r\nin the late contest with Dhoondia Waugh, of the seasons, the nature of\r\nthe country, its roads, its produce, and its means of defence, will be\r\nof use in pointing them out.”\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that the knowledge gained by Wellesley during\r\nthe performance of an individual duty was stored up for future use. A\r\nmarch or a campaign was not simply carried out and then dismissed. It\r\nwas a lesson learned and to be remembered. In military matters he was\r\nto a very appreciable extent self-taught. No drill-book in existence\r\ncan furnish skill or assure victory, and genius itself is valueless\r\non the battle-field without a clear perception based on things\r\nascertained--“the experience which has been acquired” referred to in\r\nthe above communication. Napoleon, against whom Wellesley was to fight\r\nin the years to come, early recognized the supreme importance of this\r\nprinciple. “The adroit man,” he says, “profits by everything, neglects\r\nnothing which can increase his chances.”\r\n\r\nThe “Sepoy General” was such a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWar with the Marhattás\r\n\r\n(1801-3)\r\n\r\n  “_We must get the upper hand, and if once we have that, we shall\r\n  keep it with ease, and shall certainly succeed._”\r\n\r\n            WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat disappointments are frequently blessings in disguise had already\r\nbeen proved by Arthur Wellesley. Unfortunately, it is easier to forget\r\nsuch a precept than to practise it, and each apparent failure to climb\r\nanother rung of ambition’s ladder is apt to be regarded as a definite\r\nset back. It was so with Wellesley, and a time of trial and perplexity\r\nfollowed the campaign of Seringapatam and the defeat of Dhoondia.\r\n\r\nHe eventually weathered the storm of depression which pressed upon him,\r\nas he weathered many another, but it must be admitted that he bent\r\nbefore it. It came about in this way. The French army in Egypt was\r\nstill very active, although Napoleon had long since left it. He was\r\nnow First Consul, and gradually preparing himself and the nation for\r\nthe assumption of the Imperial crown. The Governor-General, henceforth\r\nto be known as Marquis Wellesley,[11] was of opinion that a small\r\nexpedition should be sent either to Batavia or the Mauritius, or to\r\nassist Sir Ralph Abercromby in his attempt to drive the French out of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nWith one of these desirable objects in view his brother Arthur was\r\ngiven 5000 troops. He at once set off for Trincomalee, in the island\r\nof Ceylon, the headquarters of the little army, intent on personally\r\nsuperintending the arrangements. Shortly afterwards instructions came\r\nto hand from the Home Government that 3000 men were to be sent to\r\nEgypt. Colonel Wellesley was informed of this decision, and determined\r\nto lose no time in forwarding the project. Without receiving official\r\nword to do so, and still believing he held the premier post, he\r\nembarked the men and sailed for Bombay, where he had ordered an ample\r\nsupply of provisions to be ready.\r\n\r\nWhen off Cape Comorin, Wellesley received a letter from his brother,\r\nstating that he had appointed Major-General Baird to the command of the\r\ntroops destined for the island of Batavia, which made it clear that the\r\nGovernor-General had not then received the dispatches of the Secretary\r\nof State. Knowing that some at least of the troops on the transports\r\nwould be required for Egypt, he proceeded on his way, and wrote to\r\nBaird of his intention. A little later a further letter came to hand\r\nfrom another source; but the fleet was in want of water, some of the\r\ntroops had died, and “I was induced to adhere to my original plan.”\r\n\r\nBaird, who, on arriving at Trincomalee, found “the cupboard was\r\nbare,” was deeply incensed at Wellesley’s high-handed behaviour. The\r\n“culprit’s” feelings as to the Governor-General’s new appointment were\r\nalso far from pacific. That he acted in perfect good faith is evident\r\nfrom the preceding, which is borne out in a lengthy dispatch in which\r\nhe sought to justify his action in the eyes of his brother.\r\n\r\n“I have not been guilty of robbery or murder,” he writes to Henry\r\nWellesley from Bombay on the 23rd March 1801, “and he has certainly\r\nchanged his mind; but the world, which is always good-natured towards\r\nthose whose affairs do not exactly prosper, will not, or rather does\r\nnot, fail to suspect that both, or worse, have been the occasion of my\r\nbeing banished, like General Kray, to my estate in Hungary.[12] I did\r\nnot look, and did not wish, for the appointment which was given to me;\r\nand I say that it would probably have been more proper to give it to\r\nsomebody else; but when it was given to me, and a circular written to\r\nthe governments upon the subject, it would have been fair to allow me\r\nto hold it till I did something to deserve to lose it.\r\n\r\n“I put private considerations out of the question, as they ought and\r\nhave had no weight in causing either my original appointment or my\r\nsupercession. I am not quite satisfied with the manner in which I have\r\nbeen treated by Government upon the occasion. However, I have lost\r\nneither my health, spirits, nor temper in consequence thereof. But it\r\nis useless to write any more upon a subject of which I wish to retain\r\nno remembrance whatever.”\r\n\r\nBaird would have been scarcely human had he not felt hurt by finding\r\nhimself head of a force which had disappeared, especially as the\r\nColonel had already superseded him as Governor of Seringapatam. But\r\nhe forgave, if he did not forget, and so did Wellesley. Some thirty\r\nyears afterwards, when Baird’s days of active soldiering were over, he\r\nremarked, during the course of a chat with Sir John Malcolm, who had\r\nhimself done good service in India: “Time’s are changed. No one knows\r\nso well as you how severely I felt the preference given on several\r\noccasions to your friend Wellesley, but now I see all these things from\r\na far different point of view. It is the highest pride of my life that\r\nanybody should ever have dreamed of my being put in the balance with\r\nhim. His name is now to me joy, and I may almost say glory.”\r\n\r\nIt is satisfactory to know that Arthur Wellesley was not foolish enough\r\nto allow the iron to enter into his soul to such an extent as to\r\nprevent him from co-operating with Baird, into whose hands he placed a\r\n“Memorandum on the Operations in the Red Sea,” accompanied by a letter\r\nacknowledging “the kind, candid, and handsome manner in which you have\r\nbehaved towards me.” When the expedition was ready, Arthur Wellesley\r\nwas laid low with a fever, consequently the Commander-in-Chief\r\nwas obliged to sail without his lieutenant, not altogether to his\r\ndiscomfiture one would surmise.\r\n\r\nAn attack of the dreaded Malabar itch did not tend to a speedy recovery\r\nof the invalid, but he was sufficiently well in May 1801 to resume his\r\nformer duties at Seringapatam, where he had been reinstated by his\r\nbrother. By living moderately, drinking little or no wine, avoiding\r\nmuch medicine, taking exercise, and keeping his mind employed, he\r\neventually recovered. As Baird saw no fighting, his rival lost nothing\r\nby remaining in India.\r\n\r\nSir Herbert Maxwell[13] assumes that Arthur Wellesley’s fever\r\nwas caused by disappointment, but as the latter expressly states\r\nthat Baird’s “conduct towards me has by no means occasioned this\r\ndetermination (namely, to resign the appointment), but that it has\r\nbeen perfectly satisfactory,”[14] the statement is obviously based on\r\na surmise that the Colonel was diplomatically lying. Everybody fully\r\nappreciates the influence of mind over matter, and thwarted desire may\r\nhave weakened Wellesley’s health, but surely the facts of the case\r\nscarcely justify so definite an assertion.\r\n\r\nColonel Wellesley remained in Mysore for nearly two years, during\r\nwhich he did his work both wisely and well, showing favour to none and\r\njustice to all. It was in February 1803 that the future Wellington,\r\nnow a Major-General, received news that he was required for active\r\nservice against the Marhattás. The war-like intentions of this powerful\r\nconfederacy, which alone could challenge British supremacy, had not\r\nescaped the notice of Government. The nominal head of the five native\r\nprinces who constituted it was Baji Rao, the Peshwá of Poona, the\r\nothers being Daulat Rao, Sindhia of Gwalior; Jeswant Rao, Holkar of\r\nIndore; the Gaikwár of Baroda, and the Bhonsla Rájá of Berar. Sindhia\r\nwas the most powerful, and possessed a fine army drilled by French\r\nofficers and commanded by Perron, a deserter from the French Marine.\r\n\r\nHolkar had at his disposal no fewer than 80,000 splendidly-equipped\r\nmen, mostly cavalry, likewise organized by European soldiers. Intense\r\nrivalry existed between these princes, and when, in October 1802, the\r\nlatter invaded Poona, the armies of Sindhia and the Peshwá met with\r\ndisaster. The Peshwá sought refuge with the British, and forthwith\r\nentered into an offensive and defensive alliance with Lord Wellesley\r\nas the only means of saving his territory. The chief clauses were that\r\n6000 British troops should be kept at Poona, the expense being met by\r\nthe assignment to the East India Company of certain territory; that the\r\nPeshwá would not make war with the other princes or allow them to prey\r\non each other without the consent of Government; and that he should be\r\nreinstated in his capital. This arrangement, known as the Subsidiary\r\nTreaty of Bassein, soon had the effect of drawing together the\r\nremaining members of the Marhattá confederacy, cementing a friendship\r\nbetween Sindhia and Holkar, and an alliance between Sindhia and the\r\nBhonsla Rájá. It is clear that the continued acknowledgment of the\r\nPeshwá as head of the confederacy, now that he was under the ægis of\r\nthe British, would have been to admit the supremacy of the conquering\r\nPower they so much resented. Lord Wellesley had already signed a\r\ndefensive alliance with the Gaikwár of Baroda, and in order to be ready\r\nfor eventualities, men from the armies of the three Presidencies,\r\nnamely, Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta, were concentrated at various\r\npoints, the first for operation on the north-west frontier of Mysore,\r\nthe second for action about Surat and Broach, and the third for the\r\noccupation of Cuttack. A large force was also ordered to assemble at\r\nCawnpore under General Lake, the Commander-in-Chief in India, while\r\nthree corps were held in reserve. Major-General Wellesley was placed in\r\ncommand of a detachment of some 10,600 troops, to which must be added\r\nthe Nizám’s contingent of 8400 men under Colonel Stevenson, making\r\n19,000 in all. His orders were to secure Poona, now held by a small\r\ngarrison of Holkar’s soldiers totalling not more than 1500. He was\r\nalready on the march when he heard of the intention of the Governor,\r\nacting on Holkar’s instructions, to burn the town on the approach of\r\nthe British.\r\n\r\n“We were within forty miles of the place”--Wellesley himself tells\r\nthe story[15]--“when this resolution of Holkar’s lieutenant was\r\ncommunicated to me. My troops had marched twenty miles that day under\r\na burning sun, and the infantry could no more have gone five miles\r\nfarther than they would have flown. The cavalry, though not fresh,\r\nwere less knocked up, so I got together 400 of the best mounted among\r\nthem, and set off. We started after dark on the night of the 19th of\r\nApril, and in the afternoon of the 20th we got close to the place.\r\nThere was an awful uproar, and I expected to see the flames burst out,\r\nbut nothing of the kind occurred. Amrut Rao--that was the Marhattá’s\r\nname--was too frightened to think of anything except providing for his\r\nown safety, and I had the satisfaction of finding, when I rode into the\r\ntown, that he had gone off with his garrison by one gate as we went in\r\nby another. We were too tired to follow, had it been worth while to do\r\nso, which it was not. Poona was safe, and that was all I cared for.”\r\nIn the following month the Peshwá returned to his capital.\r\n\r\nSindhia and the Rájá of Berar now busied themselves with gathering a\r\nlarge army at Burhanpur, ready to threaten the Deccan, Holkar retiring\r\nto Indore. Wellesley was no less active at Poona; his experience in\r\nHolland had taught him the all-important lesson that an efficient\r\norganization is a powerful ally. In addition, he was busy endeavouring\r\nto come to terms with Sindhia and the Rájá, for which purpose he had\r\nbeen given chief command of the British forces in the Marhattá states,\r\nwith the fullest political authority. Similar powers were vested in\r\nGeneral Lake in Northern India. After wasting as much time as possible\r\nin the negotiations so as to gain it for military preparations,\r\nWellesley anticipated the inevitable. “I offered you peace on terms\r\nof equality,” he writes on the 6th August 1803, “and honourable\r\nto all parties: you have chosen war, and are responsible for all\r\nconsequences.” On the following day hostilities were declared against\r\nSindhia and the Rájá of Berar.\r\n\r\nThe stone-built fortress of Ahmednuggur, the capture of which would\r\nsafeguard his communications with Poona and Bombay and prevent\r\nreinforcements from Southern India reaching the enemy, was his first\r\nobject of attack. The main body of Sindhia’s men was threatening\r\nHyderabad, but the place was well garrisoned and so solidly constructed\r\nthat it looked as though it would defy whatever artillery could be\r\nbrought to bear on it. Wellesley said that with the exception of\r\nVellore, in the Carnatic, it was the strongest country fort he had\r\never seen. However, he began operations against the outworks on the\r\n8th, after having made proposals for its surrender without favourable\r\nresult. “The Arabs,” we are told, “defended their posts with the\r\nutmost obstinacy,” but towards evening were forced to quit the wall.\r\nOn the following day the ground in the neighbourhood of the fort was\r\nreconnoitred and a commanding position seized, on which a battery\r\nof four guns was constructed for use during the attack. The first\r\nshots were fired on the 10th at dawn, and the storming party speedily\r\nbegan its work. Three times an officer ascended a scaling ladder\r\npropped against one of the walls, and thrice he was hurled down by the\r\ndefenders. The fourth attempt was successful, and, followed by some of\r\nhis men, the gallant soldier literally hewed a way into the town. The\r\nremaining troops, pressing on, took the place of those who fell. At\r\nlength the Commander of the enemy’s forces surrendered, “on condition\r\nthat he should be allowed to depart with his garrison, and that he\r\nshould have his private property.” His fourteen hundred men marched out\r\nof the fort, and Wellesley’s troops took possession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “He was hurled down by the defenders”\r\n\r\nThomas Maybank]\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd September the General found himself and his small\r\ncontingent of some 8000 soldiers face to face with the whole combined\r\narmy of Sindhia and the Rájá of Berar, a state of affairs brought\r\nabout by unreliable information, causing the separation of Wellesley\r\nand Stevenson. At least 50,000 of the enemy were posted in a strong\r\nposition behind the river Kaitna, near the village of Assaye. As\r\nWellesley had received no reinforcements, and had only 17 guns compared\r\nwith 128 commanded by skilful French officers at the disposal of the\r\nMarhattás, the disproportion of the forces was sufficiently obvious.\r\nTo a general less experienced or daring the situation would have been\r\nconsidered sufficient cause for an instant retreat; even he called\r\nthe attack “desperate.” The problem for him to settle was, should he\r\nwait a few hours for Stevenson, or begin immediately with the scanty\r\nresources at his disposal? Although only 1500 of his men were British,\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief decided on the latter alternative, ignoring the\r\ninformation vouchsafed by his guides that the river was absolutely\r\nimpassable. Yet it was only by crossing the stream that he could take\r\nadvantage of the opportunity to attack. Here Wellesley’s native wit\r\nand acute intelligence--he himself called it “common sense”--assisted\r\nhim. His telescope merely revealed a village on either side of the\r\nstream. This fact suggested the probability of a neighbouring ford.\r\nOn investigation such proved to be the case, and if the passage was\r\ndifficult the General was at least fortunate in being able to carry\r\nout the operation without severe molestation by the enemy, who had\r\nfoolishly neglected to guard this point. They repaired the omission so\r\nfar as was possible by firing upon the oncoming army as it slowly waded\r\nacross, but the losses were comparatively trivial. “All the business of\r\nwar,” Wellesley once told Croker, “and indeed all the business of life,\r\nis to endeavour to find out what you don’t know by what you do.”\r\n\r\nThe battle began well by the routing of some of the infantry and\r\nartillery by the Highlanders and Sepoys. This advantage was almost\r\nimmediately counterbalanced by the mistaken zeal of the officer\r\ncommanding the pickets, supported by the 74th Regiment. He foolishly\r\nled his men against the village, thereby exposing them to the\r\nconcentrated fire of the enemy’s artillery and musketry stationed\r\nthere. Had he taken a less direct route, this could not have happened,\r\nbut his enthusiasm overruled his caution. Men dropped down like\r\nninepins in a skittle-alley when the ball is thrown by a skilful\r\nplayer. They fell by the dozen as they came within the zone of fire.\r\nTheir comrades filled up the tell-tale gaps and continued to push\r\non with a dogged tenacity entirely worthy their intrepid commander.\r\nMeanwhile what few British guns remained pounded away, and were\r\nsilenced one by one as the men who worked them fell dead at their post.\r\nThe enemy’s cavalry then proceeded to decimate the already sorely\r\ndepleted ranks of the 74th.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the 19th Light Dragoons, under Colonel Maxwell, were\r\nhurled at Sindhia’s troops. The charge turned the fate of the day.\r\nWhat remained of the 74th rallied under the support thus given, and\r\nwhen Wellesley led the 78th into action the village fell. An attempt\r\nwas made by the enemy to rally, but it was too late. Men who, with true\r\nOriental cunning, had fallen as though killed in order to avoid the\r\noncoming British cavalry as they charged, and had escaped the iron-shod\r\nhoofs of the horses, rejoined the ranks, only to find that the day\r\nhad been lost. The whole body was soon flying helter-skelter from the\r\nblood-stained field towards Burrampur, abandoning artillery, baggage,\r\nammunition--everything that precluded swift movement. Twelve hundred of\r\nthe Marhattás breathed their last on this memorable day.\r\n\r\nIn fighting this battle--“the hardest-fought affair that ever took\r\nplace in India”--o’er again in the twilight of his days, the Duke\r\nof Wellington made light of the indiscretions of the officers at\r\nAssaye and remembered only their bravery. “I lost an enormous number\r\nof men: 170 officers were killed and wounded, and upwards of 2000\r\nnon-commissioned officers and privates;[16] but we carried all before\r\nus. We took their guns, which were in the first line, and were fired\r\nupon by the gunners afterwards, who threw themselves down, pretending\r\nto be dead, and then rose up again after our men had passed; but they\r\npaid dearly for the freak. The 19th cut them to pieces. Sindhia’s\r\ninfantry behaved admirably. They were in support of his cannon, and we\r\ndrove them off at the point of the bayonet. We pursued them as long as\r\ndaylight lasted and the exhausted state of the men and horses would\r\nallow; and slept on the field.”[17]\r\n\r\nWellesley himself, although not wounded, lost two horses. An\r\neye-witness has recorded that he had never seen “a man so cool and\r\ncollected as he was the whole time.” Stevenson arrived on the\r\nfollowing evening, and set out almost immediately to follow the enemy,\r\nWellesley being forced to remain owing to his lack of transport for the\r\nwounded, whom he refused to leave. The Colonel seconded Wellesley’s\r\nmagnificent victory by reducing the fortress of Burrampur on the\r\n16th October, and that of Asseerghur on the 21st. Wellesley covered\r\nStevenson’s operations and defended the territories of the Nizám and\r\nthe Peshwá. “I have been like a man who fights with one hand and\r\ndefends himself with the other,” he notes on the 26th October. “I have\r\nmade some terrible marches, but I have been remarkably fortunate:\r\nfirst, in stopping the enemy when they intended to press to the\r\nsouthward, through the Casserbarry ghaut; and afterwards, by a rapid\r\nmarch to the northward, in stopping Sindhia, when he was moving to\r\ninterrupt Colonel Stevenson’s operations against Asseerghur; in which\r\nhe would otherwise have undoubtedly succeeded.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLast Years in India\r\n\r\n(1803-5)\r\n\r\n  “_Time is everything in military operations._”\r\n\r\n            WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBhonsla Rájá now became the immediate object of Wellesley’s attention.\r\nWhile proceeding in quest of him the General received envoys from\r\nSindhia requesting an armistice. This was granted on the 23rd November\r\n1803, the principal condition imposed by Wellesley being that the\r\nenemy’s army should retire forty miles east of Ellichpúr. This clause\r\nwas not fulfilled, the cavalry of the wily Sindhia encamping at\r\nSersooly, some four miles from the position occupied by Manoo Bappoo,\r\nbrother of the Rájá, ready for immediate co-operation. Having again\r\nunited their divisions, Wellesley and Stevenson pushed towards them. “A\r\nconfused mass” about two miles beyond Sersooly proved to be the enemy’s\r\narmies on the march. A little later the General made out “a long line\r\nof infantry, cavalry, and artillery, regularly drawn up on the plains\r\nof Argaum, immediately in front of that village.”\r\n\r\n“Although late in the day,” says Wellesley in describing the events\r\nof the 29th November, “I immediately determined to attack this army.\r\nAccordingly, I marched on in one column, the British cavalry leading in\r\na direction nearly parallel to that of the enemy’s line; covering the\r\nrear and left by the Mogul and Mysore cavalry. The enemy’s infantry and\r\nguns were in the left of their centre, with a body of cavalry on their\r\nleft. Sindhia’s army, consisting of one very heavy body of cavalry,\r\nwas on the right, having upon its right a body of pindarries and other\r\nlight corps. Their line extended above five miles, having in their rear\r\nthe village and extensive gardens and enclosure of Argaum; and in their\r\nfront a plain, which, however, was much cut by watercourses, etc.\r\n\r\n“I formed the army in two lines; the infantry in the first, the cavalry\r\nin the second, and supporting the right; and the Mogul and Mysore\r\ncavalry the left, nearly parallel to that of the enemy; with the right\r\nrather advanced in order to press upon the enemy’s left. Some little\r\ntime elapsed before the lines could be formed, owing to a part of the\r\ninfantry of my division which led the column having got into some\r\nconfusion. When formed, the whole advanced in the greatest order; the\r\n74th and 78th regiments were attacked by a large body (supposed to be\r\nPersians), and all these were destroyed. Sindhia’s cavalry charged\r\nthe 1st battalion, 6th regiment, which was on the left of our line,\r\nand were repulsed; and their whole line retired in disorder before\r\nour troops, leaving in our hands 38 pieces of cannon and all their\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\n“The British cavalry then pursued them for several miles, destroyed\r\ngreat numbers, and took many elephants and camels and much baggage. The\r\nMogul and Mysore cavalry also pursued the fugitives, and did them great\r\nmischief. Some of the latter are still following them; and I have sent\r\nout this morning all of the Mysore, Mogul, and Marhattá cavalry, in\r\norder to secure as many advantages from this victory as can be gained,\r\nand complete the enemy’s confusion.... The troops conducted themselves\r\nwith their usual bravery....”\r\n\r\nOne of the bravest deeds performed during the battle of Argaum was\r\nthat of Lieutenant Langlands, of the 74th. Wounded in the fleshy\r\npart of the leg by a spear, he promptly pulled out the weapon and\r\nthrust it through the body of the Arab who had thrown it. A Sepoy who\r\nwitnessed this extraordinary display of self-possession, forgetting all\r\ndiscipline, rushed from the ranks and patted the young officer on the\r\nback, yelling in his native tongue, “Well done, sir; very well done!”\r\n\r\nWellesley next marched on the mountain fort of Gawilghur, strongly\r\ngarrisoned by the Rájá’s troops. This defence consisted of an outer and\r\ninner fort, the former protected by strongly-built walls, and the whole\r\nby ramparts and towers. Admittance was gained only by three gates, all\r\nextremely difficult of access by an invading army owing to the roads\r\nleading to them. That to the south, communicating with the inner fort,\r\nwas long and steep, and could only be negotiated on foot; the second\r\nwas exposed to the guns mounted on the west side and was extremely\r\nnarrow and scarped by rock; the third, or north gate, communicated with\r\nthe village. Wellesley chose the last as being the most practicable for\r\nhis purpose, although he did not blind his eyes to the fact that “the\r\ndifficulty and labour of moving ordnance and stores from Labada would\r\nbe very great.”\r\n\r\nFrom the 7th December, when the corps under Wellesley and Stevenson\r\nmarched from Ellichpúr by different routes, till the 12th, “on which\r\nColonel Stevenson broke ground near Labada, the troops in his division\r\nwent through a series of laborious services, such as I never before\r\nwitnessed, with the utmost cheerfulness and perseverance. The heavy\r\nordnance and stores were dragged by hand over mountains, and through\r\nravines, for nearly the whole distance, by roads which it had been\r\npreviously necessary for the troops to make for themselves.”\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 12th, Stevenson erected two batteries in front of\r\nthe north face of the fort, and Wellesley one on the mountain, “under\r\nthe southern gate.” Although firing was begun on the following morning,\r\nthe breaches in the walls of the outer fort were not sufficiently\r\nlarge for practical purposes until the 14th. Next day, while the\r\nstorming party was getting to work, Wellesley made two attacks from\r\nthe southward so as to draw the enemy’s fire upon himself as much as\r\npossible. The north-west gate was carried, and a detachment entered\r\nwithout difficulty. Captain Campbell, with the light infantry of the\r\n94th, then succeeded in fixing ladders against the wall of the inner\r\nfort. They “escaladed the wall, opened the gate for the storming party,\r\nand the fort was shortly in our possession.” In a later communication\r\nWellesley mentions that he never knew a place taken by storm which\r\nwas so little plundered, “and it is but doing justice to the corps to\r\ndeclare that in an hour after having stormed that large place, they\r\nmarched out with as much regularity as if they had been only passing\r\nthrough it.”\r\n\r\nBhonsla Rájá had already sent his vakeel[18] to sue for peace. This\r\nwas granted by his ceding to the Company the province of Cuttack, with\r\nthe district of Balasore, and dismissing the European officers who\r\nhad played so important a part in the drilling of his army. Sindhia\r\nalso “began to be a little alarmed respecting his own situation,” and\r\nshortly afterwards concluded hostilities, handing over all the country\r\nbetween the Jumna and the Ganges, and several important fortresses.\r\nThese happenings did not relieve Wellesley from active service.\r\nSeveral bands of freebooters, “the terror of the country,” consisting\r\nmainly of fugitive soldiers from the defeated armies, were carrying\r\non lawless practices in the West Deccan. After crossing the Godavery,\r\nhe and some of his troops marched many weary miles along bad roads,\r\noften at accelerated speed, in order to attack them, only to find\r\nthat the enemy had received intelligence of their approach, probably\r\nfrom a traitor in Wellesley’s own ranks. With set purpose the General\r\ncontinued to follow where the marauders led, and eventually broke up\r\nthe bands, securing the whole of their guns, ammunition, and baggage,\r\nthus depriving them of their means of warfare: “they have lost every\r\nthing which could enable them to subsist when collected.” Wellesley\r\nafterwards asserted that his chase of the freebooters was the greatest\r\nmarch he ever made.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of May 1804 Wellesley received instructions from the\r\nGovernor-General to break up the army in the Deccan, the task of\r\nrunning to earth Holkar, the sole remaining enemy of the confederacy,\r\nbeing given to Lake. In the following month he relinquished his\r\ncommand, and after a short visit to Calcutta returned to Seringapatam.\r\nHe had already requested that he might be allowed to leave India “when\r\ncircumstances will permit it,” and the Commander-in-Chief had given him\r\nthe necessary permission. He was dissatisfied because he had not been\r\npromoted since he became Major-General, “and I think that there appears\r\na prospect of service in Europe, in which I should be more likely to\r\nget forward.” In addition, he was suffering from rheumatism, “for which\r\nliving in a tent during another monsoon is not a very good remedy.” He\r\nsailed for the Homeland on the 10th March 1805, after six years of hard\r\nwork, and still harder fighting, in the interests of British rule in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe following contemporary pen-portrait of “the Sepoy General,”\r\nsketched for us by Captain Sherer, will enable us to visualize him as\r\nhe appeared at this time:\r\n\r\n“General Wellesley was a little above the middle height, well limbed,\r\nand muscular; with little incumbrance of flesh beyond that which\r\ngives shape and manliness to the outline of the figure; with a firm\r\ntread, an erect carriage, a countenance strongly patrician, both in\r\nfeature, profile, and expression, and an appearance remarkable and\r\ndistinguished: few could approach him on any duty, or on any subject\r\nrequiring his serious attention, without being sensible of a something\r\nstrange and penetrating in his clear light eye. Nothing could be more\r\nsimple and straightforward than the matter of what he uttered; nor did\r\nhe ever in his life affect any peculiarity or pomp of manner, or rise\r\nto any coarse, weak loudness in his tone of voice. It was not so that\r\nhe gave expression to excited feeling.”\r\n\r\nTo what extent did the Governor-General influence his brother’s career\r\nin India? First of all we must understand the position of the Marquis\r\nWellesley. It was naturally one of tremendous power and responsibility.\r\nThe glamour attached to the post was sufficiently evident to the\r\ngeneral public. There it ended, for it was glitter rather than gold to\r\nits holder. The Directors of the East India Company, ever on the side\r\nof rigid economy and large dividends, expressly forbade the costly\r\nsystem of conquest and annexation, yet this was necessarily the sheet\r\nanchor of Wellesley’s policy, as former chapters have shown. When\r\npacific measures were tried and failed, it would have been disastrous\r\nto continue them. As it usually took over three months[19] for a\r\ncommunication from India to reach England, it follows that the same\r\nperiod was necessary for a reply. The consequences of indecision on\r\nthe part of the Viceroy, of waiting for advice from home in matters\r\nrequiring urgency, were therefore fraught with dire peril. On the\r\nother hand, if he showed too despotic tendencies he ran a grave risk\r\nof incurring displeasure. Indeed, this is exactly what happened, for\r\nLord Wellesley was recalled in 1805 and censured by the Court of\r\nProprietors. When, after thirty years, it became evident that his\r\nadministration had been wise and not foolish, that he had carried\r\nout what would have had to be done eventually to establish British\r\ninfluence, the Directors relented and voted him a grant of £20,000.\r\n\r\nFortunately there was “a barrier state” in London between the\r\nGovernor-General and the Directors in the person of the President of\r\nthe Board of Control, the said Board consisting of Cabinet Ministers.\r\nThis position had been occupied since July 1802 by Lord Castlereagh,\r\nwho, on taking office, found that Wellesley had come to the conclusion\r\nthat resignation was better than humiliation. He did much to smooth\r\nover the difficulties, and from that time until Wellesley’s return to\r\nEngland Castlereagh loyally supported the Viceroy on every possible\r\noccasion. For instance, when the reduction of the Indian establishment\r\nto 10,000 troops was seriously mooted by the Directors and the Cabinet\r\nat home, notwithstanding the threatening attitude of the Marhattá\r\nconfederacy, it was largely due to Castlereagh’s support of Lord\r\nWellesley’s demands that so absurd a policy was prevented.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Board of Control never interfered in the matter\r\nof patronage, knowing full well that the Governor-General on the spot\r\nwas better able to recognize merit for the special requirements of the\r\nservice than a man thousands of miles away. This brings us back to our\r\nproper subject.\r\n\r\nWe have noted how Lord Mornington discerned the opportunity awaiting\r\nhis brother in India, and how that brother reciprocated when the former\r\nwas diffident in the matter of accepting the chief official post there.\r\nIt is true that Wellesley was made Governor of Seringapatam over the\r\nhead of Baird, his senior officer, but whether this appointment was due\r\nto the fact that Mornington influenced General Harris in the matter of\r\nhis choice is not sufficiently evident. There is a strong suspicion\r\nthat it was,[20] because Arthur Wellesley had only served as commander\r\nof the reserve, whereas Baird was the leader of the assault, and as\r\nsuch military tradition unquestionably favoured his appointment.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the matter of the Batavian expedition, the Governor-General\r\noffered Wellesley the appointment as military commander: “The King\r\nhas given me the power of selecting the persons who are to conduct\r\nthis expedition; ... and a conscientious sense of duty induces me\r\nto think that you are the most fit person to be selected for that\r\nservice, provided you can safely be spared from Mysore for the period\r\nof the expedition....” In Mornington’s opinion, “the expedition will\r\nbe very advantageous to the naval and military commanders.” On the\r\nother hand, we know that when the project was abandoned for a diversion\r\non the coasts of the Red Sea, he superseded his brother. One wonders\r\nwhat would have happened when Wellesley set off for Bombay without\r\ninstructions, had he not been closely related to the Governor-General.\r\nThe Marquis certainly did not minimize Arthur’s successes to those at\r\nhome. Writing to Addington, then Speaker of the House of Commons, in\r\nOctober 1800, he says, “My brother Arthur has distinguished himself\r\nmost brilliantly in an expedition against an insurgent, who had\r\ncollected a great force of predatory cavalry--the wreck of Tippú’s\r\narmy.” Three years later, when Addington was Prime Minister, he again\r\ndrew attention to his brother’s achievements, as follows:--\r\n\r\n“My public duty will not permit me to be silent respecting\r\nMajor-General Wellesley. His march from Mysore to Poona, his able\r\nconduct of the measures adopted for restoring the Peishwah, for\r\nconciliating the feudatory Mahratta chiefs who maintained their\r\nallegiance to the Peishwah, for preserving the dominions of the\r\nNizám, and our interests at Hyderabad, combined with his sieges of\r\nAhmednuggur, Burrampur, and Asseerghur, his glorious and splendid\r\nvictories at Assaye and on the plains of Argaum, with the entire ruin\r\nof Sindhia’s French troops and powerful artillery in the Deccan,\r\nmust place the name of General Wellesley among the most bright and\r\ndistinguished characters that have adorned the military history of\r\nthe British power in India. He is now employed in reducing the main\r\nfortress of Perar, and in negotiating, with the utmost judgment and\r\nskill, the conditions of peace. I leave his merits to your justice, and\r\nto the judgment of his King and country. The pride and honour of being\r\nallied by the nearest ties of blood to such an officer cannot absolve\r\nme from the obligations of my public station, as the representative\r\nof the supreme civil and military authority in India; and I cannot,\r\ntherefore, omit this testimony to the merits of General Wellesley\r\nwithout a positive violation of my duty.”[21]\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of such glowing praise from a brother on the\r\nscore of good taste, it evidently achieved its purpose, for before he\r\nleft India, Arthur Wellesley was appointed an extra Knight Companion of\r\nthe Bath and received the thanks of the King and Parliament.\r\n\r\nEarl Roberts,[22] in summing up this phase of the future Duke’s career,\r\nremarks: “On his arrival in India he found himself in a country where\r\nin almost every matter the power and influence of the Governor-General\r\nwere supreme, and the Governor-General being his brother, he was\r\nquickly placed in a position of responsibility, which gave him the\r\nopportunity of developing his talents as a soldier and statesman in\r\nthe best of all schools--the school of practice. It cannot be denied\r\nthat in early life Wellington owed much to family influence,[23] and\r\nto a system of promotion which would now be stigmatized as jobbery.\r\nOn the other hand, he took full advantage of every chance that was\r\nthrown in his way, and by his industry and capacity fully justified the\r\nexceptional favour with which he was treated.”\r\n\r\nWith this conclusion the present writer heartily agrees; whatever Sir\r\nArthur gained from his relative’s assistance was amply repaid in his\r\nachievements. British India owes much to the brothers Wellesley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nService in England, Ireland, and Denmark\r\n\r\n(1805-7)\r\n\r\n  “_I am not afraid of responsibility, God knows, and I am ready to\r\n  incur any personal risk for the public service._”\r\n\r\n            WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1803, the short-lived Peace of Amiens came to an end, and\r\nGreat Britain and France again resorted to the sword, Napoleon’s first\r\nfeat of arms was the conquest of Hanover. Thus, at the very beginning\r\nof the second phase of the Great War, George III found himself not only\r\nminus his hereditary continental possessions, but deprived of a very\r\nuseful base for those futile military excursions so beloved of the\r\nBritish Government.\r\n\r\nThat His Majesty received the tidings of his loss “with great\r\nmagnanimity, and a real kingliness of mind,” may or may not be true.\r\nHis ministers asserted that such was the case; considerations of policy\r\nwould have precluded them from saying otherwise.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, two months after Sir Arthur Wellesley landed in\r\nEngland, that is to say, in November 1805, he was given the command of\r\na brigade in an expedition to Hanover about to be undertaken by Lord\r\nCathcart. The object was to rout the comparatively few French troops\r\nleft to garrison the country, and to co-operate with Russian, Swedish,\r\nand Danish troops in ridding Germany of the common enemy. The surrender\r\nof Mack at Ulm, and Napoleon’s wonderful victory at Austerlitz,\r\nalthough it followed within a few weeks of Nelson’s signal triumph at\r\nTrafalgar,[24] completely shattered this desirable object, just as\r\nthe negotiations that followed put an end to the ambitious hopes of\r\nthe Third Coalition. The recall of the troops before they had been\r\nable to carry out any of the objects of the diversion, beyond gaining\r\nsome thousands of adherents to the rank and file, therefore became\r\nimperative, and was duly effected.\r\n\r\nSir Arthur Wellesley now spent a short time in command of his brigade\r\nat Hastings, and he was gazetted colonel of the famous 33rd Regiment,\r\nwhich post had become vacant on the death of the venerable Marquis\r\nCornwallis, his brother’s successor in India. The next important\r\nevent in his life, if not in his career, was his marriage to the Hon.\r\nCatherine Pakenham, thus consummating a romance begun many years\r\nbefore,[25] and his single ambition apart from the Army. The ceremony\r\nwas performed in Dublin on the 10th April 1806, the bridegroom being\r\nnearly thirty-seven years of age. One wishes it were possible to add\r\nthat “they lived happy ever after.” Biography, the twin sister of\r\nHistory, tells us that it was not so, and Gleig suggests that a broken\r\nengagement with a second suitor, of which Wellesley was not informed\r\non his return from India, was partly the cause.[26] Two days after the\r\nwedding Wellesley was elected Member of Parliament for Rye, his main\r\nobject in seeking political distinction being that he might defend\r\nhis brother’s administration in India, where his system of making\r\nrecalcitrant States subsidiary to England, whilst retaining their own\r\nrulers, was the subject of an embittered attack. The “high crimes and\r\nmisdemeanours” alleged against Lord Wellesley were referred to from\r\ntime to time, but on the 17th March 1808, the following motion was\r\ncarried by 182 votes against 31: “That it appears to this House that\r\nthe Marquis Wellesley, in his arrangements in the province of Oude,\r\nwas actuated by an ardent zeal for the service of his country, and an\r\nanxious desire to promote the safety, interests, and prosperity of the\r\nBritish Empire in India.” This did not altogether end the unsavoury\r\naffair, for another unsuccessful attempt to incriminate the statesman\r\nwas made some time later.\r\n\r\nSir Arthur was by this time Chief Secretary for Ireland, having\r\nbeen appointed in the previous year. Once again we see two members\r\nof this distinguished family holding prominent appointments, for\r\nHenry Wellesley became one of the Secretaries to the Treasury in the\r\nnewly-appointed Portland ministry.\r\n\r\nBarrington, whose acquaintance we have already made, relates an\r\ninteresting anecdote of the soldier at this time. He met Lord\r\nCastlereagh, accompanied by a gentleman, in the Strand. “His lordship\r\nstopped me,” he writes, “whereat I was rather surprised, as we had not\r\nmet for some time; he spoke very kindly, smiled, and asked if I had\r\nforgotten my old friend, Sir Arthur Wellesley? whom I discovered in his\r\ncompanion, but looking so sallow and wan, and with every mark of what\r\nis called a worn-out man, that I was truly concerned at his appearance.\r\nBut he soon recovered his health and looks, and went as the Duke of\r\nRichmond’s[27] secretary to Ireland, where he was in all material\r\ntraits still Sir Arthur Wellesley, but it was Sir Arthur Wellesley\r\njudiciously improved. He had not forgotten his friends, nor did he\r\nforget himself. He said that he had accepted the office of secretary\r\nonly on the terms that it should not impede or interfere with his\r\nmilitary pursuits; and what he said proved true....”\r\n\r\nObviously his duties in Ireland bear no comparison with those he so\r\nsuccessfully undertook in India, but following his own maxim, “to do\r\nthe business of the day in the day,” he got through a vast amount of\r\nroutine labour, frequently important, sometimes trivial. Under the\r\nformer head we must put his investigation of the military defences of\r\nthe island. It must not be forgotten that although the invasion of the\r\nUnited Kingdom by Napoleon was no longer a standing menace, there was\r\nalways a likelihood of its resurrection, and Ireland was the danger\r\nzone.\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Tilsit, signed between France and Russia on the 7th July\r\n1807, and between France and Prussia on the 9th of the same month,\r\nwas a most serious blow to British interests. By a secret treaty the\r\nEmperor Alexander undertook to aid Napoleon against England if that\r\nPower refused to make peace within a certain period, to recognize the\r\nequality of all nations at sea, and to hand back the conquests made by\r\nher since 1805. As a bait--it really savoured of insult--Great Britain\r\nwas to be offered Hanover. Should she refuse these terms the Autocrats\r\nof France and of Russia agreed to compel Denmark, Sweden, and Portugal\r\nto join them in a vast naval confederacy against Great Britain, and\r\nto close their ports against her. In addition, the reigning monarchs\r\nof Spain and Portugal were to be deposed in favour of the Bonaparte\r\nfamily. For his connivance in the matter Alexander was to be handsomely\r\ncompensated in the Ottoman Empire and by territorial acquisitions in\r\nWestern Europe.\r\n\r\nFortunately, or otherwise, according to the point of view, the British\r\nCabinet was put in possession of certain facts regarding these\r\nplans. Canning, who was Minister for Foreign Affairs, realizing the\r\nresponsibilities of his unenviable position, as also of that of his\r\ncountry, determined to forestall the plotters. He felt that some kind\r\nof arrangement with Denmark was essential, especially as the Prince\r\nRegent of Portugal had communicated news to the effect that Napoleon\r\npurposed to invade England with the Portuguese and Danish fleets.\r\nCanning suggested to Denmark that her fleet should be put in the safe\r\ncustody of England until peace was restored. In addition, he promised\r\na subsidy of £100,000, and the assistance of troops should Denmark be\r\nattacked. Mr F. J. Jackson was sent to open negotiations; the Prince\r\nRoyal promptly vetoed them. “I stated plainly,” says Jackson, “that I\r\nwas ordered to demand the junction of the Danish fleet with that of\r\nEngland, and that in case of refusal it was the determination of His\r\nMajesty to enforce it.”\r\n\r\nLord Cathcart was put in command of an army of 27,000 troops, the\r\nnaval portion of the expedition being placed in the hands of Admiral\r\nGambier. No sooner had Sir Arthur Wellesley heard of the project than\r\nhe communicated with Castlereagh, then at the War Office and ever his\r\nstaunch supporter, for an opportunity to take part. He was given charge\r\nof a division. On the 3rd August a formidable array of twenty-five\r\nsail-of-the-line and over fifty gunboats and transports appeared off\r\nElsinore. Gambier and Cathcart were told by Jackson “that it now\r\nrested with them to carry out the measure prescribed by the British\r\nGovernment.” In a letter to his brother the diplomatist adds, “The\r\nDanes must, I think, soon surrender, for they are without any hopes\r\nof succour, are unfurnished with any effectual means of resistance,\r\nand are almost in total want of the necessaries of life, as far as I\r\ncould learn or was able to see for myself during my few hours’ stay\r\nthere.[28] There were no droves of cattle or flocks of sheep; no\r\nprovisions of any sort being sent in the direction of the city. No\r\ntroops marching towards the town; no guns mounted on the ramparts; no\r\nembrasures cut, in fact, no preparations of any sort. What the Danes\r\nchiefly rely on is the defence by water. They brought out this morning\r\nseveral _praams_[29] and floating batteries, and cut away one or two of\r\nthe buoys.\r\n\r\n“The garrison of Copenhagen does not amount to more than four thousand\r\nregular troops. The _landwehr_ is a mere rabble, as indeed all _levées\r\nen masse_ must be.\r\n\r\n“The people are said to be anxious to capitulate before a conflagration\r\ntakes place, which must happen soon after a bombardment begins, when,\r\nnot improbably, the fleet as well as the city will become a prey to the\r\nflames.”\r\n\r\nJackson’s prophecy came true, but against his statement that the army\r\ndisembarked at Veldbeck “in grand style,” we must set that of Captain\r\nNapier: “I never saw any fair in Ireland so confused as the landing;\r\nhad the enemy opposed us, the _remains_ of the army would have been on\r\ntheir way to England.”[30] Wellesley’s first affray--it can scarcely\r\nbe termed a battle--took place at Roskilde. Like almost everything\r\nconnected with the expedition, Jackson has something to say about\r\nit, and that “something” in this particular instance is anything but\r\ncomplimentary. “Sir Arthur Wellesley,” he tells his wife, “has had an\r\naffair which you will probably see blazoned forth in an extraordinary\r\n_Gazette_. With about four thousand men he attacked a Danish corps of\r\narmed peasantry, and killed and wounded about nine hundred men, besides\r\ntaking upwards of fifteen hundred prisoners, amongst whom were sixty\r\nofficers. One was a General officer. I spoke to him this morning,\r\nfor he and his officers are let off on their parole. The men are on\r\nboard prison ships, and miserable wretches they are, fit for nothing\r\nbut following the plough. They wear red and green striped woollen\r\njackets, and wooden _sabots_. Their long lank hair hangs over their\r\nshoulders, and gives to their rugged features a wild expression. The\r\nknowing ones say that after the first fire they threw away their arms,\r\nhoping, without them, to escape the pursuit of our troops. In fact,\r\nthe _battle_ was not a very glorious one, but this you will keep for\r\nyourself.”[31]\r\n\r\nWellesley himself afterwards referred to the event as “the little\r\nbattle at Kiöge,” and mentioned that “the Danes had made but a\r\npoor resistance; indeed, I believe they were only new raised\r\nmen--militia.”[32]\r\n\r\nThe bombardment of Copenhagen began on the 2nd September 1807, and\r\nconcluded three days later, when an armistice was granted in order\r\nthat terms might be discussed. On the 7th, Copenhagen capitulated.\r\nThe conditions imposed by Sir Arthur Wellesley, Sir Home Popham, and\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Murray were that the British should occupy the\r\ncitadel and dockyards for six weeks, and take possession of the ships\r\nand naval stores. Their troops would then evacuate Zealand. “I might\r\nhave carried our terms higher ... had not our troops been needed at\r\nhome,” Wellesley writes to Canning. The various clauses were carried\r\nout, and fifteen sail-of-the-line, fifteen frigates, and thirty-one\r\nsmaller vessels of the Danish fleet, as well as 20,000 tons of naval\r\nstores, were escorted to England. “That the attack was necessary,” says\r\na recent historian, “no one will now deny. England was fighting for her\r\nexistence; and, however disagreeable was the task of striking a weak\r\nneutral, she risked her own safety if she left in Napoleon’s hand a\r\nfleet of such proportions. In Count Vandal’s words, she ‘merely broke,\r\nbefore he had seized it, the weapon which Napoleon had determined to\r\nmake his own.’”[33] Dr J. Holland Rose disapproves, and points out\r\nthat “In one respect our action was unpardonable: it was not the last\r\ndesperate effort of a long period of struggle: it came after a time of\r\nselfish torpor fatal alike to our reputation and the interests of our\r\nallies. After protesting their inability to help them, Ministers belied\r\ntheir own words by the energy with which they acted against a small\r\nState.”[34]\r\n\r\nCanning’s hope for an alliance with Sweden, in order to keep open the\r\nBaltic, was destined never to be fulfilled. Sir John Moore was sent to\r\nassist Gustavus in his efforts to resist the attacks of Russia, but\r\nthe nation deserted the King, deposed him, and joined Napoleon. War\r\nspeedily broke out between Sweden and Denmark, and also between the\r\nlatter and Great Britain. The Czar’s overtures to England on behalf of\r\nFrance, as arranged at Tilsit, came to nothing. He was not anxious for\r\nthem to have any other ending, so enraptured was he with Napoleon’s\r\ngrandiloquent schemes. Enraptured? Yes, but only for a few short years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe First Battles of the Peninsular War\r\n\r\n(1808)\r\n\r\n  “_In war _men_ are nothing: it is a _man_ who is everything._”\r\n\r\n            NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his return from Copenhagen, Wellesley, never happy unless his mind\r\nwas fully occupied, resumed his duties as Chief Secretary for Ireland.\r\nSpecial mention of the services he had rendered to his country was made\r\nin the House of Commons, and there was some talk of a second period in\r\nIndia, where affairs were far from settled. Before long, however, it\r\nbecame increasingly evident that his knowledge and ability would be\r\nrequired nearer home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELLINGTON’S PENINSULAR CAMPAIGNS.]\r\n\r\nPortugal, our old ally, had been forced by Napoleon to declare war\r\nagainst Great Britain on the 20th October 1807. Bent on pursuing\r\nthe rigid restrictions on trade imposed by his Continental System,\r\nhe had also peremptorily ordered the confiscation of the property\r\nof the British merchants. Fortunately for those most concerned, the\r\nPrince Regent remembered past friendship and may have discerned future\r\npossibilities. He temporized, and this enabled many of the English\r\nresidents to settle their affairs and sail for home before the Dictator\r\ncould enforce obedience. The sequel was the overrunning of the\r\nkingdom by French troops under the intrepid Junot, who met with no\r\nresistance, and the desertion of their subjects by the Royal Family,\r\nwho sailed for Brazil.\r\n\r\nAlthough this plan was carried out at the earnest request of the\r\nBritish Government, as represented by Lord Strangford, the Ambassador\r\nat the Portuguese Capital, it cannot be regarded as a pleasing example\r\nof patriotism on the part of the House of Braganza.\r\n\r\nIn October 1807, Junot, in command of the French Army, and strengthened\r\nby a few regiments of the Spanish corps placed at Napoleon’s disposal\r\nfor the dismemberment of the western portion of the Iberian Peninsula,\r\nbegan his march on Lisbon. He concluded it on the 30th November with\r\nonly 1500 troops, the remainder following slowly by reason of the\r\nterrible sufferings they had endured during a forced march made at\r\nNapoleon’s urgent behest.\r\n\r\nHere it should be mentioned that the presence of the Spanish troops\r\nwas due to the infamous Treaty of Fontainebleau, signed the previous\r\nOctober. In this arrangement the Emperor had promised Godoy, the\r\nreal ruler of Spain and an intensely ambitious man, a large slice of\r\nterritory in the country about to be conquered in return for favours\r\nrendered. It is more than probable that Napoleon never intended this\r\nparticular clause to be taken seriously by anyone but his dupe; the\r\ngift was so much dust thrown in the eyes of the favourite for the\r\npurpose of securing the entry of French troops into Spain.[35] In this\r\nhe was pre-eminently successful. Once in Lisbon Junot speedily removed\r\nany fear of the national army by breaking up many of the regiments and\r\nsending the remainder on service outside the kingdom. The flames of\r\nrebellion were not yet kindled. So far so good.\r\n\r\nUnhappily the chief prizes which the Emperor had hoped to secure at\r\nLisbon were beyond his reach. Even the squadron which was to have\r\nseized the Portuguese and British shipping in the harbour was held in\r\ncheck by the hated English.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, pretending to be the friend of Spain, was in reality her\r\nworst enemy. He merely used her as a useful tool to pick Portuguese\r\nlocks, and then pursued the same course with his friend’s lockers.\r\nHe began his unwelcome attentions by seizing the important frontier\r\nfortresses of Pampeluna, Barcelona, San Sebastian, and Figueras, and\r\ninvading the country by a force which speedily numbered 116,000 men,\r\nmostly conscripts, for he thought the country easy prey. Murat entered\r\nMadrid as Junot had entered Lisbon. By the most unscrupulous methods,\r\nnamely, the enforced abdication of Charles IV and his son Ferdinand,\r\nthe Emperor secured the throne, permanently as he fondly imagined, for\r\nhis brother Joseph, King of Naples.\r\n\r\nIn July 1808 the eldest Bonaparte was proclaimed King, and entered his\r\ncapital. Within a month he found it desirable to retire behind the\r\nEbro; his subjects had not only broken into open revolt, but a French\r\narmy of over 17,000 troops under Dupont had been forced to capitulate\r\nat Baylen, in Andalusia. Riots, assassinations, and massacres made it\r\nevident that the Spanish temper was considerably more dangerous than\r\nthat of the Portuguese; it soon became obvious, moreover, that the\r\npeople had employed some of their time in organizing, on a necessarily\r\nrough and ready principle, such forces as they possessed.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the Asturias, in the north, were the first of the\r\nprovincials to apply the torch to the tinder of revolt, after a riot in\r\nMadrid on the 2nd May 1808, and its Junta General called into being a\r\nlevy of 18,000 men to protect the principality. It sent two deputies to\r\nEngland for assistance, which was readily given in money and military\r\nstores. Other provinces likewise selected Juntas, and Galicia also\r\ndispatched representatives to plead its cause in London. Galicia,\r\nadjoining the Asturias on the west, lost little time in following the\r\nwarlike example of its neighbours, and the arsenals of Coruña and\r\nFerrol, made memorable by the Trafalgar campaign, threw in their lot\r\nagainst Napoleon and contributed no fewer than thirty-two battalions of\r\nregulars and militia to the general forces. Leon and Old Castile also\r\nrose in rebellion, though with less energy. There were too many French\r\nin the Basque Provinces and Navarre for much to be attempted there.\r\nComing still farther to the east, Catalonia sheltered 16,000 regulars\r\nand many irregular levies, but Aragon, Valencia, and Murcia were very\r\nweak. Andalusia, in the extreme south of the country, was almost as\r\nfortunately placed with regard to troops as Galicia, and the remains of\r\nthe French fleet which had escaped Nelson and Collingwood were taken as\r\nthey rode in Cadiz harbour.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing approaching united action, provinces and towns often\r\nvieing in more or less friendly rivalry. They did not understand, or\r\nif they understood they did not realize, that patriotic cliques do\r\nnot make for strength. They fought for themselves rather than for the\r\nnation as a whole. Throughout the struggle we find a lack of cohesion.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to look at the earliest available statistics[36] of the\r\nvarious Spanish armies which formed the front line, we find that their\r\ntotal strength in regulars, militia battalions, and newly-raised corps\r\nwas 151,248. They were divided into five chief armies, namely, of\r\nGalicia, Aragon, Estremadura, the Centre, and Catalonia, under Generals\r\nBlake, Palafox, Galluzzo, Castaños, and Vives respectively. The troops\r\nof the second line numbered about 65,000, and included the Army of\r\nGranada, under Reding, the Army of Reserve of Madrid, commanded by San\r\nJuan, the Galician, Asturian, Estremaduran, Andalusian, Murcian and\r\nValencian reserves, and the 3000 odd men in garrison in the Balearic\r\nIsles.\r\n\r\nThe gross total of the French Army of Spain at this period dwarfs the\r\nabove figures for all their brave show; it reached 314,612. From this\r\nmust be deducted 32,643 detached troops and 37,844 in hospital or\r\nmissing, making the “effective” no fewer than 244,125. Of the eight\r\ncorps, Victor commanded the 1st, Bessières[37] the 2nd, Moncey the\r\n3rd, Lefebvre the 4th, Mortier the 5th, Ney the 6th, St Cyr the 7th,\r\nand Junot the 8th. There were also Reserve Cavalry and Infantry, the\r\nImperial Guard, troops marching from Germany, and National Guards\r\ninside the French frontier.[38]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that on the 31st May 1808 Napoleon had only 116,000\r\nmen in Spain and that within six months he had found it necessary to\r\nmore than double that number, the desperate nature of the undertaking\r\nbecomes plain.\r\n\r\nTo enter fully into the doings of the various armies throughout the war\r\nwould deflect us far out of our proper course, but we shall hear of\r\nthem whenever Wellesley was involved.\r\n\r\nIf you would know the ferocious spirit of the patriots, the hate they\r\ncherished for Napoleon and the French, you have only to turn to any one\r\nof the many Memoirs of men who fought in the Peninsular War. Captain,\r\nlater Sir Harry, Smith, who was with Sir John Moore in 1808 and\r\nremained with Wellesley until March 1814, gives many instances in his\r\nvivacious “Autobiography,”[39] but the following must suffice. Smith’s\r\nguide happened to be the owner of the house in which his wife and\r\nbaggage were quartered in the village of Offala:\r\n\r\n“After I had dressed myself,” he relates, “he came to me and said,\r\n‘When you dine, I have some capital wine, as much as you and your\r\nservants like; but,’ he says, ‘come down and look at my cellar.’ The\r\nfellow had been so civil, I did not like to refuse him. We descended by\r\na stone staircase, he carrying a light. He had upon his countenance a\r\nmost sinister expression. I saw something exceedingly excited him: his\r\nlook became fiend-like. He and I were alone, but such confidence had we\r\nEnglishmen in a Spaniard, and with the best reason, that I apprehended\r\nno personal evil. Still his appearance was very singular. When we got\r\nto the cellar-door, he opened it, and held the light so as to show\r\nthe cellar; when, in a voice of thunder, and with an expression of\r\ndemoniacal hatred and antipathy, pointing to the floor, he exclaimed,\r\n‘There lie four of the devils who thought to subjugate Spain! I am a\r\nNavarrese. I was born free from all foreign invasion, and this right\r\nhand shall plunge this stiletto in my own heart as it did into theirs,\r\nere I and my countrymen are subjugated!’ brandishing his weapon like\r\na demon. I see the excited patriot as I write. Horror-struck as I\r\nwas, the instinct of self-preservation induced me to admire the deed\r\nexceedingly, while my very frame quivered and my blood was frozen,\r\nto see the noble science of war and the honour and chivalry of arms\r\nreduced to the practices of midnight assassins. Upon the expression\r\nof my admiration, he cooled, and while he was deliberately drawing\r\nwine for my dinner, which, however strange it may be, I drank with\r\nthe gusto its flavour merited, I examined the four bodies. They were\r\nDragoons--four athletic, healthy-looking fellows. As we ascended, he\r\nhad perfectly recovered the equilibrium of his vivacity and naturally\r\ngood humour. I asked him how he, single-handed, had perpetrated this\r\ndeed on four armed men (for their swords were by their sides). ‘Oh,\r\neasily enough. I pretended to love a Frenchman’ (or, in his words,\r\n‘I was an Afrancesado’), ‘and I proposed, after giving them a good\r\ndinner, we should drink to the extermination of the English.’ He then\r\nlooked at me and ground his teeth. ‘The French rascals, they little\r\nguessed what I contemplated. Well, we got into the cellar, and drank\r\naway until I made them so drunk, they fell, and my purpose was easily,\r\nand as joyfully, effected.’ He again brandished his dagger, and said,\r\n‘Thus die all enemies to Spain.’ Their horses were in his stable. When\r\nthe French Regiment marched off, he gave these to some guerrillas in\r\nthe neighbourhood. It is not difficult to reconcile with truth the\r\nassertion of the historian who puts down the loss of the French army,\r\nduring the Spanish war, as 400,000 men, for more men fell in this\r\nmidnight manner than by the broad-day sword, or the pestilence of\r\nclimate, which in Spain, in the autumn, is excessive.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir Harry Smith and the Spanish Patriot\r\n\r\nThomas Maybank]\r\n\r\nThat there was considerable cause for complaint on the part of the\r\nSpaniards is also borne out by other eye-witnesses. Napier records that\r\na captain and his company came across a peasant’s hut and demanded\r\nprovisions, as was their wont. The father explained that his children\r\nwere half-starving, and he had but little food left. He was told that\r\nhe would be hanged to a beam. Should he give a sign that he repented of\r\nhis decision he would be cut down, but not otherwise. He was strung up\r\nwithout further ado. Then the cries of his wife and children overcame\r\nhis noble act of self-sacrifice, and he was released. The soldiers\r\nthen took every scrap of food in the miserable dwelling and departed.\r\nA similar method was adopted by a second body of plunderers, and\r\nwhen they could find nothing they spitefully killed the poor fellow,\r\ndoubtless on the charge that he was hiding his stock.\r\n\r\nRobert Blakeney, in noticing that most writers have referred to the\r\nSpanish army as “ragged, half-famished wretches,” cautions us that\r\nthe men themselves must not be blamed for their unkempt appearance.\r\n“The scandal and disgrace,” he writes, “were the legitimate attributes\r\nof the Spanish Government. The members of the Cortez and Juntas were\r\nentirely occupied in peculation, amassing wealth for themselves and\r\nappointing their relatives and dependents to all places of power and\r\nemolument, however unworthy and unqualified; and although it was\r\nnotorious that shiploads of arms, equipments, clothing, and millions\r\nof dollars were sent from England for the use and maintenance of the\r\nSpanish troops, yet all was appropriated to themselves by the members\r\nof the general or local governments or their rapacious satellites,\r\nwhile their armies were left barefoot, ragged and half-starved. In\r\nthis deplorable state they were brought into the field under leaders,\r\nmany of whom were scarcely competent to command a sergeant’s outlying\r\npiquet; for in the Spanish army, as elsewhere, such was the undue\r\ninfluence of a jealous and covetous aristocracy, that, unsupported\r\nby their influence, personal gallantry and distinction, however\r\nconspicuous, were but rarely rewarded.”[40] The same officer, who\r\njoined the 28th Regiment as a boy of fifteen and saw much service in\r\nthe Peninsular War, assures us that “Courage was never wanting to the\r\nSpanish soldiers; but confidence in their chiefs was rare.”[41]\r\n\r\nAn expedition against the American colonies of Spain had been mooted\r\nseveral times by the British Cabinet, and Sir Arthur Wellesley had\r\nreported on ways and means. The scheme had developed sufficiently for\r\nsome 8000 troops to be assembled at Cork preparatory to embarking for\r\nthe voyage. It was finally decided that the troops should be used for\r\na descent on Portugal, with the immediate intention of expelling the\r\nFrench and raising the enthusiasm of the population against Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe force sailed on the 12th July 1808 with Wellesley, now a\r\nLieutenant-General, in command.\r\n\r\nJohn Wilson Croker, who served his country as Secretary to the\r\nAdmiralty from 1809 to 1830, dined with Sir Arthur and Lady Wellesley\r\nin Harley Street on the evening before the General set out for Cork.\r\nAfter settling some business connected with Ireland, Wellesley “seemed\r\nto lapse into a kind of reverie,” his guest informs us, “and remained\r\nsilent so long that I asked him what he was thinking of. He replied,\r\n‘Why, to say the truth, I am thinking of the French that I am going to\r\nfight. I have not seen them since the campaign in Flanders, when they\r\nwere capital soldiers, and a dozen years of victory under Buonaparte\r\nmust have made them better still. They have besides, it seems, a new\r\nsystem of strategy, which has out-manœuvred and overwhelmed all the\r\narmies of Europe. ’Tis enough to make one thoughtful; but no matter:\r\nmy die is cast, they may overwhelm me, but I don’t think they will\r\nout-manœuvre me. First, because I am not afraid of them, as everybody\r\nelse seems to be; and secondly, because if what I hear of their system\r\nof manœuvres be true, I think it a false one as against steady troops.\r\nI suspect all the continental armies were more than half beaten before\r\nthe battle was begun. I, at least, will not be frightened beforehand.”\r\n\r\nWellesley made the voyage to Portugal in a fast frigate, and landed\r\nat Coruña on the 20th July 1808, ahead of his troops. This gave him\r\nsufficient time to make a preliminary study of the situation at first\r\nhand, and to be ready for immediate operations on the arrival of his\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe first news he received was not encouraging, for it told of the\r\nbattle of Medina de Rio Seco, which Bessières had won against the Army\r\nof Galicia on the 14th July. A little relief was afforded by rumours\r\nof success elsewhere, and “the arrival of the British money,” speedily\r\nrenewed the flagging spirits of the patriots who were fighting under\r\nsuch adverse conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Junta of Galicia, while keenly appreciative of gold, ammunition,\r\nand arms, showed no disposition to avail themselves of the Commander’s\r\nservices, and suggested his landing in the north of Portugal as\r\nthe government of Oporto was collecting native troops in that\r\nneighbourhood. “The difference between any two men,” Wellesley writes\r\non the 21st July, the day before he sailed from Coruña, “is whether\r\nthe one is a better or a worse Spaniard, and the better Spaniard is\r\nthe one who detests the French most heartily. I understand that there\r\nis actually no French party in the country; and at all events I am\r\nconvinced that no man now dares to show that he is a friend to the\r\nFrench.”\r\n\r\nTo sum up the situation was not an arduous task for Wellesley. He came\r\nto the conclusion without further ado that the only reasonable way to\r\nassist the Spaniards was “to get possession of and organize a good army\r\nin Portugal.” He proceeded to the fleet off Cape Finisterre, spent a\r\nfew hours there, and then went to Oporto, where he had an important\r\nconference with the Bishop, who was also head of the Portuguese Junta,\r\nand a number of military officers. It was eventually decided that about\r\n5300 troops, chiefly infantry, stationed at Coimbra under Bernardino\r\nFreire, should be used to co-operate with Wellesley, and that the\r\nremaining forces, namely, 12,000 peasants, should either be employed\r\nin the neighbourhood or in the province of Tras os Montes, where a\r\nFrench attack seemed probable. Finally a spot in Mondego Bay was chosen\r\nas the most suitable point for disembarkation, especially as it had\r\nthe additional advantage of being near Coimbra. On the 1st August the\r\nbusiness commenced, tiresome, and not unattended by danger because of\r\nthe heavy surf.\r\n\r\nWellesley had much to think about while this was proceeding. He had\r\njust received the amazing news that he had been superseded by Sir\r\nHew Dalrymple, with Sir Harry Burrard as second in command, that Sir\r\nJohn Moore was on his way with 10,000 men, and that he (Wellesley) and\r\nLieut.-Generals the Hon. J. Hope, Sir E. Paget, and Mackenzie Frazer\r\nwere to command divisions. Whatever agitation the new arrangements may\r\nhave occasioned Wellesley, he did not allow it to shake his purpose or\r\nlessen his enthusiasm for the cause he had now so much at heart. He\r\nwrites to Castlereagh, “Whether I am to command the army or not, or\r\nam to quit it, I shall do my best to insure its success; and you may\r\ndepend upon it that I shall not hurry the operations, or commence them\r\none moment sooner than they ought to be commenced, in order that I may\r\nacquire the credit of the success. The Government will determine for\r\nme what way they will employ me hereafter, whether here or elsewhere.”\r\nHe then goes on to sketch a campaign suitable for an army “of 30,000\r\nPortuguese troops, which might be easily raised at an early period; and\r\n20,000 British, including 4000 or 5000 cavalry.”\r\n\r\n“The weather was so rough and stormy,” writes one of the soldiers of\r\nthe 71st Regiment, “that we were not all landed until the 5th. On our\r\nleaving the ship, each man got four pound of biscuit, and four pound\r\nof salt beef cooked on board. We marched, for twelve miles, up to the\r\nknees in sand, which caused us to suffer much from thirst; for the\r\nmarching made it rise and cover us. We lost four men of our regiment,\r\nwho died of thirst. We buried them where they fell. At night we came to\r\nour camp ground [Lugar], in a wood, where we found plenty of water, to\r\nus more acceptable than anything besides on earth. We here built large\r\nhuts, and remained four days. We again commenced our march alongst\r\nthe coast, towards Lisbon. In our advance, we found all the villages\r\ndeserted, except by the old and destitute....”\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 8th, General Spencer and his corps of 4500 men\r\njoined Wellesley from Cadiz, where he had landed at the request of\r\nthe Junta of Seville. By the 11th the whole army had arrived at\r\nLeiria, and on the following day it was augmented by 2300 of Freire’s\r\nPortuguese troops, their commander refusing point blank to march with\r\nhis remaining forces unless certain impossible demands were met. “My\r\nobject,” writes Wellesley, “is to obtain possession of Lisbon, and to\r\nthat I must adhere, whatever may be the consequences, till I shall have\r\nattained it, as being the first and greatest step towards dispossessing\r\nthe French of Portugal.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Junot had sent instructions to Generals Loison and Delaborde\r\nto effect a junction and attack Wellesley. This was prevented by the\r\ntimely arrival of the British troops at Leiria, for the former was\r\nsome sixteen miles to the south-east and the latter about the same\r\ndistance to the south-west. Wellesley was consequently between them.\r\nThis necessitated Loison’s return to the southward if he wished to join\r\nDelaborde, and the British General determined to prevent the operation.\r\nOn the 14th, Wellesley was at Alcobaço, from whence the French had\r\nretreated but a few hours before.\r\n\r\nAlthough a small engagement took place near Obidos, Wellesley did not\r\noffer battle until two days later because his whole force had not yet\r\ncome up. The conflict occurred at Roliça, where Delaborde’s army was\r\nawaiting him on a hill. We know that the allied force totalled 15,000;\r\nthe strength of the enemy is uncertain, Wellesley believing it to be\r\n6000, while Professor Oman[42] gives the figure as “about 4350 men,”\r\nbasing his conclusion on known official returns previous to the fight\r\nand making allowance for probable losses by sickness.\r\n\r\n“On the morning of the 17th,” says the eye-witness already quoted, “we\r\nwere under arms an hour before day. Half an hour after sunrise, we\r\nobserved the enemy in a wood. We received orders to retreat. Having\r\nfallen back about two miles, we struck to the right, in order to come\r\nupon their flank, whilst the 9th, 29th, and 5th battalion of the 60th,\r\nattacked them in front. They had a very strong position on a hill. The\r\n29th advanced up the hill, not perceiving an ambush of the enemy, which\r\nthey had placed on each side of the road. As soon as the 29th was right\r\nbetween them, they gave a volley, which killed, or wounded, every man\r\nin the grenadier company, except seven. Unmindful of their loss, the\r\nregiment drove on, and carried the entrenchments.[43] The engagement\r\nlasted until about four o’clock, when the enemy gave way. We continued\r\nthe pursuit, till darkness put a stop to it. The 71st had only one\r\nman killed and one wounded. We were manœuvring all day, to turn their\r\nflank; so that our fatigue was excessive, though our loss was but\r\nsmall.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the battle of Roliça, Wellesley’s first victory over the\r\nFrench. He was perfectly satisfied with the fighting and moral\r\nqualities of his men as displayed in this engagement.\r\n\r\n“I cannot sufficiently applaud the conduct of the troops throughout\r\nthis action,” he tells Castlereagh. Although he had a superiority of\r\nstrength, the number of soldiers “actually employed in the heat of the\r\naction,” namely, 4635, was, “from unfavourable circumstances ... by\r\nno means equal to that of the enemy.” The returns showed 479 British\r\nkilled, wounded, and missing, and the French about 600.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nVictory Abroad, and Displeasure at Home\r\n\r\n(1808-9)\r\n\r\n  “_From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step._”\r\n\r\n            NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a mere handful of soldiers, Junot, big with ideas of a future\r\nkingship, and underestimating the strength and fighting powers of the\r\nenemy, left Lisbon and entered the field against Wellesley, whose\r\ntroops were now encamped at Vimiero to cover the landing of 4000\r\nadditional men under Generals Anstruther and Acland. Having joined\r\nforces with the unfortunate Loison and Delaborde and thereby brought up\r\nthe total strength of his army to 13,056 men, the Marshal prepared to\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nWellesley, who had over 18,000 troops, including 2000 Portuguese, was\r\nwell prepared, nay eager, for the encounter, but, unfortunately for\r\nhim, Burrard arrived on the evening of the 20th August. When Wellesley\r\nexplained to him his scheme of operations he showed no disposition to\r\nfall in with it. Wellesley had wished Sir John Moore to proceed to\r\nLisbon by land in order to cut off Junot’s retreat, but the less-active\r\nBurrard would have none of it, and ordered him to wait until Moore’s\r\narrival. “Whether we advance or not,” replied the General, “we shall\r\nhave to fight. For the French will certainly attack us if we do not\r\nattack them.”\r\n\r\nThis prophecy was fulfilled about 8 o’clock on the morning of the\r\n21st August 1808, when squadrons of the enemy’s cavalry appeared. An\r\nattack was made on the British advanced guard. The French were driven\r\nback at the point of the bayonet, while other troops, stationed in the\r\nchurchyard of Vimiero, prevented them from reaching the village of that\r\nname, and Acland’s brigade attacked them in flank. “A most desperate\r\ncontest” was necessary before the enemy recoiled in confusion, during\r\nwhich they lost heavily in killed and wounded, and in _material_\r\nseven pieces of cannon. Other French troops, supported by a large\r\nbody of cavalry, turned their attention to the heights on the road to\r\nLourinhão, where Ferguson’s brigade was stationed. The latter charged\r\nwith praiseworthy coolness, and again there was a tale of disaster to\r\ntell when the enemy fell back, while half a dozen guns were captured.\r\nAn attempt to recover part of the lost artillery resulted in the French\r\nbeing obliged to retire “with great loss.”\r\n\r\nBurrard, who had slept on the vessel which had brought him out, did\r\nnot arrive on the field till late in the day, and took no part in\r\nthe direction of the battle until Wellesley wished to pursue the\r\nenemy to Torres Vedras and cut them off from Lisbon. “Sir Harry,” he\r\nsaid, “now is your time to advance, the enemy is completely beaten,\r\nand we shall be in Lisbon in three days.” This his senior officer\r\nabsolutely forbade. Had the former been allowed to follow his own\r\nwishes he believed that, “in all probability, the whole would have\r\nbeen destroyed.” As it was, at least 1800 of the enemy were rendered\r\n_hors de combat_, including 300 or 400 troops who were made prisoners.\r\nThe British lost in killed and missing 186 men, and 534 were wounded.\r\nThe General was again delighted with the behaviour of his men, and in\r\ncommunicating with the Duke of York, he averred that “this is the\r\nonly action I have ever been in, in which every thing passed as it was\r\ndirected and no mistake was made by any of the Officers charged with\r\nits conduct.”\r\n\r\nOne splendid incident, one altogether human touch, affords relief\r\nto the story of the battle of Vimiero. A piper of the gallant 71st\r\nHighlanders, severely wounded in the thigh and deeply in need of\r\nsurgical aid, continued to blow his pibroch for the encouragement of\r\nhis colleagues, until exhaustion finally conquered his determined\r\nspirit. Seated on the ground he declared that “the lads should nae\r\nwant music to their wark,” and went on with his weird music as though\r\nparading within the walls of Edinburgh Castle.\r\n\r\n“I afterwards saw him,” relates Lieut.-General Sir William Warre, “in\r\na hovel, where we collected the wounded ... both French and English. I\r\nshook him by the hand, and told him I was very sorry to see so fine a\r\nfellow so badly hurt; he answered, ‘Indeed, captain, I fear I am done\r\nfor, but there are some of those poor fellows,’ pointing to the French,\r\n‘who are very bad indeed.’”\r\n\r\nSuch coolness, typified in successive instances, although not always\r\nunder such conditions,[44] has made our Empire what it is to-day. The\r\n“common” British soldier, sowing the highway with his bones, enables a\r\nlater generation to reap a golden harvest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Gallant Piper at Vimiera\r\n\r\nThomas Maybank]\r\n\r\nIt is due to the French to record that they were not without men\r\nequally as cool as Piper Mackay. A typical example is furnished by\r\nMajor Ross-Lewin, who fought in the 32nd, and it occurred immediately\r\nafter the battle of Vimiero:\r\n\r\n“An officer of my regiment,” he relates, “happened to pass near an old\r\nFrench soldier, who was seated by the roadside, covered with dust,\r\nand desperately wounded; a cannon-shot had taken off both his feet\r\njust above the ankles, but his legs were so swollen that his wounds\r\nbled but little. On seeing the officer, the poor fellow addressed him,\r\nsaying, ‘_Monsieur, je vous conjure donnez moi mes pieds_.’ and at the\r\nsame time pointed to his feet, which lay on the road beyond his reach.\r\nHis request met with a ready compliance. The pale, toilworn features of\r\nthe veteran brightened up for an instant on receiving these mutilated\r\nmembers, which had borne him through many a weary day, and which it\r\ngrieved him to see trampled on by the victorious troops that passed;\r\nand then, as if prepared to meet his fast-approaching fate becomingly,\r\nby the attainment of this one poor wish, he laid them tranquilly\r\nbeside him, and, with a look of resignation, and the words, ‘_Je suis\r\ncontent_,’ seemed to settle himself for death.”\r\n\r\nMany years afterwards, when in a reminiscent mood, the Duke of\r\nWellington recapitulated the events of the 21st August 1808. “The\r\nFrench,” he told his guests, “came on at Vimiero with more confidence,\r\nand seemed to _feel their way_ less than [smiling] I always found them\r\nto do _afterwards_. They came on in their usual way, in a very heavy\r\ncolumn, and I received them in line, which they were not accustomed to,\r\nand we repulsed them there several times, and at last they went off\r\nbeaten on all points, while I had half the army untouched and ready to\r\npursue; but Sir H. Burrard--who had joined the army in about the middle\r\nof the battle, but seeing all doing so well, had desired me to continue\r\nin the command now that he considered the battle as won, though I\r\nthought it but half done--resolved to push it no further. I begged very\r\nhard that he would go on, but he said enough had been done. Indeed,\r\nif he had come earlier, the battle would not have taken place at all,\r\nfor when I waited on him on board the frigate in the bay the evening\r\nbefore, he desired me to suspend all operations, and said he would do\r\nnothing till he had collected all the force which he knew to be on the\r\nway. He had heard of Moore’s arrival, but the French luckily resolving\r\nto attack us, led to a different result. I came from the frigate about\r\nnine at night, and went to my own quarters with the army, which, from\r\nthe nearness of the enemy, I naturally kept on the alert. In the dead\r\nof the night a fellow came in--a German sergeant, or quartermaster--in\r\na great fright--so great that his hair seemed actually to stand on\r\nend--who told me that the enemy was advancing rapidly, and would be\r\nsoon on us. I immediately sent round to the generals to order them\r\nto get the troops under arms, and soon after the dawn of day we\r\nwere vigorously attacked. The enemy were first met by the (50th ?),\r\nnot a good-looking regiment, but devilish steady, who received them\r\nadmirably, and brought them to a full stop immediately, and soon drove\r\nthem back; they then tried two other attacks ... one very serious,\r\nthrough a valley on our left; but they were defeated everywhere, and\r\ncompletely repulsed, and in full retreat by noon, so that we had time\r\nenough to have _finished them_ if I could have persuaded Sir H. Burrard\r\nto go on.”\r\n\r\nOn the day following the battle of Vimiero, Dalrymple arrived.\r\nWhile pondering over the situation he received a proposal for an\r\narmistice from Junot, which developed into the Convention of Cintra,\r\npreliminarily signed on the 30th August 1808. The most important\r\nconditions were--the surrender of all places and forts in Portugal\r\noccupied by the French troops, the evacuation of the country, and the\r\ntransport of the army, its munitions and “property,” to France in\r\nBritish ships. By a strange oversight the important question of future\r\nservice was overlooked, consequently there was nothing to prevent an\r\nearly return of the troops to the Peninsula should Napoleon think fit\r\nfor them to do so.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider Wellesley’s part in this much discussed\r\ntransaction. The Convention was definitely signed on the 30th August\r\n1808, but previous to this a meeting of the General Officers was\r\ncalled to deliberate upon it. “The result of the meeting,” Wellesley\r\nwrites on the 29th inst., “was a proposal to make certain alterations,\r\nwhich I acknowledge I do not think sufficient, although the treaty\r\nwill answer in its amended form.... At the same time I must say that\r\nI approve of allowing the French to evacuate Portugal, because I see\r\nclearly that we cannot get them out of Portugal otherwise, under\r\nexisting circumstances, without such an arrangement; and we should\r\nbe employed in the blockade or siege of the places which they would\r\noccupy during the season in which we ought and might be advantageously\r\nemployed against the French in Spain. But the Convention, by which they\r\nshould be allowed to evacuate Portugal, ought to be settled in the\r\nmost honorable manner to the army by which they have been beaten; and\r\nwe ought not to be kept for 10 days on our field of battle before the\r\nenemy (who sued on the day after the action) is brought to terms.\r\n\r\n“I am quite annoyed on this subject.”\r\n\r\nWellesley signed the preliminary Memorandum at the request of\r\nDalrymple, but had nothing to do with the final settlement. “I lament\r\nthe situation of our affairs as much as you do,” he writes on the 5th\r\nSeptember, “and I did every thing in my power to prevent it; but my\r\nopinion was overruled. I had nothing to do with the Convention as it\r\nnow stands; and I have never seen it to this moment.... I have only to\r\nregret that I put my name to an agreement of which I did not approve,\r\nand which I did not negotiate: if I had not done it, I really believe\r\nthat they would not have dared to make such a Convention as they have\r\nmade: notwithstanding that that agreement was never ratified, and is\r\nnow so much waste paper.”[45]\r\n\r\nHis letters at this period teem with allusions to the unfortunate\r\ntreaty. He tells Castlereagh that “It is quite impossible for me to\r\ncontinue any longer with this army; and I wish, therefore, that you\r\nwould allow me to return home and resume the duties of my office, if I\r\nshould still be in office, and it is convenient to the Government that\r\nI should retain it; or if not, that I should remain upon the Staff in\r\nEngland; or, if that should not be practicable, that I should remain\r\nwithout employment. You will hear from others of the various causes\r\nwhich I must have for being dissatisfied, not only with the military\r\nand other public measures of the Commander-in-Chief, but with his\r\ntreatment of myself. I am convinced it is better for him, for the army,\r\nand for me, that I should go away; and the sooner I go the better.”\r\n\r\nOn the 6th October Wellesley was in London, and at once resumed his\r\noffice as Chief Secretary for Ireland. The newspapers teemed with\r\nunsavory references to the unpopular Convention; the caricaturists, not\r\nto be rivalled by their journalistic brethren, produced the grossest\r\nlampoons for the benefit of the indignant public. In one of them\r\nWellesley and his colleagues are hanging on gibbets, in another the\r\nformer is shown urging his troops to glory:\r\n\r\n    _This is Sir Arthur (whose valour and skill, began so well, but\r\n          ended so ill)\r\n    Who beat the French, who took the Gold, that lay in the City of\r\n          Lisbon._\r\n\r\nWindham, writing in his Diary under date of the 16th September,\r\nprobably sums up the thoughts of most British statesmen of the time:\r\n“At Chesterford heard report of news; said to be excellent, but without\r\nparticulars. Feasted upon the hopes of what I should meet at Hockrill.\r\nAlas! _quanti de spe decidi!_ it was the news of the convention with\r\nJunot. _There never was surely such a proceeding in the history of wars\r\nor negotiations._ There is no bearing the thought of it.”\r\n\r\nA Court of Inquiry was instituted. Dalrymple and Burrard were recalled,\r\nand together with Wellesley, were examined before a board of officers,\r\nwhich included General David Dundas and Lord Moira, at Chelsea\r\nHospital. The finding of the Court was non-committal “respecting\r\nthe fitness of the Convention in the relative situation of the two\r\narmies,” doubtless because a unanimous “verdict” could not be arrived\r\nat, but the members definitely declared “that unquestionable zeal and\r\nfirmness appear throughout to have been exhibited by Lieut.-Generals\r\nSir Hew Dalrymple, Sir Harry Burrard, and Sir Arthur Wellesley....”\r\nIn commenting on the judgment thus expressed, Sir Herbert Maxwell\r\nnotes that the two senior officers were never employed again, adding,\r\n“Similar eclipse might have fallen upon Sir Arthur, but for the efforts\r\nof Castlereagh and other powerful friends, whose confidence in their\r\nGeneral was never shaken.”\r\n\r\nIn the following January (1809) the House of Lords and the House of\r\nCommons expressed their thanks to General Wellesley for the victories\r\nof Roliça and Vimiero.\r\n\r\n“It is your praise,” said the Speaker in the Commons, “to have inspired\r\nyour troops with unshaken confidence and unbounded ardour; to have\r\ncommanded, not the obedience alone, but the hearts and affections of\r\nyour companions in arms; and, having planned your operations with the\r\nskill and promptitude which have so eminently characterized all your\r\nformer exertions, you have again led the armies of your country to\r\nbattle, with the same deliberate valour and triumphant success which\r\nhave long since rendered your name illustrious in the remotest parts of\r\nthis Empire.\r\n\r\n“Military glory has ever been dear to this nation; and great military\r\nexploits, in the field or upon the ocean, have their sure reward in\r\nRoyal favour and the gratitude of Parliament. It is, therefore, with\r\nthe highest satisfaction, that, in this fresh instance, I now proceed\r\nto deliver to you the thanks of this House....”\r\n\r\nWellesley’s reply was made in three well-chosen sentences, without the\r\nslightest attempt at rhetoric. In the House of Lords Vimiero was spoken\r\nof as “a signal victory, honorable and glorious to the British arms.”\r\nThe resolutions of the peers, which included high appreciation of the\r\nbehaviour of the non-commissioned officers and privates, were conveyed\r\nto Sir Arthur by the Lord Chancellor, and acknowledged by their\r\nrecipient in a short letter, the most important paragraphs of which are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“I have received the mark of distinction which the House of Lords\r\nhave conferred upon me with sentiments of gratitude and respect\r\nproportionate to the high sense I entertain of the greatness of the\r\nhonor which it carries with it; and I shall have great pleasure in\r\ncommunicating to the Officers and the troops the distinguished reward\r\nof their exemplary conduct which their Lordships have conferred upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“I beg leave, at the same time, to express to their Lordships my thanks\r\nfor the expressions of personal civility with which your Lordship has\r\nconveyed to me the commands of the House.”\r\n\r\nThese signs of approval must have been entirely satisfactory to\r\nSir Arthur after the bitter criticisms of the previous months, but\r\nwhat he particularly valued was a handsome service of plate, worth\r\nintrinsically £1000, but sentimentally beyond price, presented to him\r\nby the brigadier and field officers who were associated with him in\r\nthe victory at Vimiero. They, at any rate, had implicit faith in their\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSir Arthur’s Return to Portugal\r\n\r\n(1809)\r\n\r\n  “_We are not naturally a military people; the whole business of an\r\n  army upon service is foreign to our habits, and is a constraint\r\n  upon them, particularly in a poor country like this._”\r\n\r\n            WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaron de Frénilly, travelling to Paris in December 1808, notes that\r\n“the roads along which we passed were crowded with splendid troops\r\nwho were on their way to find a grave in the Peninsula.” Napoleon, in\r\nthe Constitution he granted to Spain, assumes for himself not only\r\nthe so-called “divine right of kings,” but the special favour of\r\nProvidence. “God,” he says, “has given me the power and the will to\r\novercome all obstacles.” Frénilly, writing after the Emperor’s death,\r\nmerely states an historical fact; Napoleon, at the height of his\r\nstupendous power, regards himself as omnipotent, and proves within a\r\nfew years that he is not.\r\n\r\nYet it must be conceded that the Dictator of Europe--apart from moral\r\nconsiderations, which never troubled him to any extent--had a certain\r\nright to infer from his past experience that the Almighty was on his\r\nside. It was not for him to foresee that the Peninsula was to prove a\r\nrunning sore of the Imperial body politic. To be sure, Joseph had not\r\nbeen particularly successful on the throne of the Spanish Bourbons,\r\nMurat had displayed many foolish qualities, Dupont had surrendered,\r\nJunot had evacuated Portugal, and eleven millions had rebelled either\r\npractically or theoretically against French domination, but there was\r\nstill himself, and God was “on the side of the heaviest battalions!”\r\n“I may find in Spain the Pillars of Hercules, but not the limits of\r\nmy power.” Thus he endeavoured to encourage his brother, and there is\r\nno reason to suspect that he imagined otherwise. He announced that he\r\nwould pour between 300,000 and 400,000 troops across the Pyrenees--he\r\nactually began the new campaign with over 200,000, which compared more\r\nthan favourably with the 120,000 ill-organized patriots under Castaños,\r\nPalafox, Vives, Belvedere, Blake, and La Romana, who usually acted\r\nwithout any idea of the value of co-operation.\r\n\r\nThe number of those ready and willing to engage in a guerilla warfare\r\ncannot be given.[46] Statistics fail in such a matter as this. Names\r\nindelibly associated with Napoleon’s greatness were either present or\r\ncoming--Victor, Bessières, Moncey, Lefebvre, Ney, St Cyr, Mortier, and\r\nJunot.\r\n\r\nWhen Dalrymple, Burrard, and Wellesley sailed from Portugal the\r\nBritish command devolved upon Sir John Moore. This being a biography\r\nof Wellington, Moore’s astounding campaign can only be referred to in\r\nthe briefest way, but it is necessary to mention the more important\r\nincidents if we are to understand the various phases of the war.\r\nLeaving 9000 men at Lisbon with Lieutenant-General Sir John Cradock,\r\nand taking with him 14,000 troops, Moore advanced into Spain to\r\nco-operate with the Spaniards according to his instructions. His own\r\ncolumns reached Salamanca, the point of concentration, in November\r\n1808, but Baird, who, with a reinforcement of 13,000 men, was to\r\neffect a junction with him, found it impossible to do so. There was\r\nmuch delay in consequence.\r\n\r\nIn the first week of the following month the Emperor was at Madrid, and\r\nthe Spanish capital once again in the hands of the French. Disaster\r\nafter disaster had followed hard in the tracks of the national forces.\r\n\r\nIt was Moore’s hope that by slowly retreating northward the enemy would\r\nfollow, and thus enable his allies in the south to recover. Having\r\nunited with Baird, and learned that Soult, with not more than 20,000,\r\nwas near Sahagun, Moore was on the eve of combat when the startling\r\nintelligence reached him that Napoleon was in pursuit. The Emperor had\r\ntold the Senate, “I am determined to carry on the war with the utmost\r\nactivity, and to destroy the armies that England has disembarked in\r\nthat country.” With wonderful promptitude Moore turned towards Coruña,\r\nwhere he believed the British fleet awaited him. Napoleon, hearing\r\ndisconcerting news from Paris, made off for his capital, leaving Soult,\r\n“the Iron Duke of France,” and Ney to pursue the red-coats.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th January 1809, the battle in which Moore received his\r\ndeath-wound was fought. Within twenty-four hours the victorious troops\r\nembarked for the homeland. Not a British soldier, other than deserters\r\nor stragglers, was left in Spain. In the sister kingdom there were\r\nsome 12,000, of whom 9000 had been left at Lisbon by Moore when he had\r\nset out for Salamanca; the remainder had arrived from England in the\r\nprevious November and December. In addition, Sir Robert Wilson had\r\nsucceeded in equipping some 1300 men at Oporto for his Loyal Lusitanian\r\nLegion.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident that war would shortly break out between\r\nFrance and Austria, thus precluding any thought on Napoleon’s part of\r\ngoing back to the Peninsula. Castlereagh, notwithstanding previous\r\nexperiences, was as enthusiastic as ever. Baird and his ragged troops\r\nwere no sooner home than it was remarked that the Secretary for War\r\nand Wellesley were very frequently together. Wiseacres foretold an\r\nearly return of the latter to Spain and Portugal.\r\n\r\nSir Arthur prepared a lengthy Memorandum on the defence of Portugal,\r\nwhich was placed in the hands of the Cabinet for careful consideration.\r\n“I have always been of opinion,” it begins, “that Portugal might be\r\ndefended, whatever might be the result of the contest in Spain; and\r\nthat in the meantime the measures adopted for the defence of Portugal\r\nwould be highly useful to the Spaniards in their contest with the\r\nFrench.”\r\n\r\nWellesley suggested the thorough reorganization of the native\r\nPortuguese troops, part of the expense being borne by Great Britain,\r\nand the employment of not less than 30,000 British troops, including\r\n4000 or 5000 cavalry and a large body of artillery. The entire army\r\nwas to be commanded by British officers. Riflemen and 3000 British or\r\nGerman cavalry should be sent as additional reinforcements as soon as\r\npossible, in addition to a corps of engineers for an army of 60,000.\r\nHe perfectly understood that the French would not be caught napping,\r\nfor “it may be depended upon that as soon as the newspapers shall have\r\nannounced[47] the departure of Officers for Portugal, the French armies\r\nin Spain will receive orders to make their movements towards Portugal,\r\nso as to anticipate our measures for its defence. We ought therefore to\r\nhave every thing on the spot, or nearly so, before any alarm is created\r\nat home respecting our intentions.”\r\n\r\nThanks in no small measure to Castlereagh, Wellesley was appointed\r\nto the supreme command of the new expedition. He left England on\r\nthe 14th April 1809, a few weeks after Soult’s vanguard had crossed\r\nthe Portuguese frontier, and landed at Lisbon on the 22nd, after\r\na most eventful voyage, having encountered terrible weather off\r\nthe Isle of Wight which threatened to drive his vessel ashore. The\r\nCommander-in-Chief thus sums up the situation in the Peninsula: “At\r\nthat time,” he says, “the French had got possession of Zaragoza,\r\nMarshal Soult held Oporto and the northern provinces of Portugal. The\r\nbattle of Medellin had been fought on the 29th March; and General\r\nCuesta was endeavouring to recover from its effects, and to collect\r\nan army again at Monasterio, in the mountains of the Sierra Morena.\r\nThe French, under Marshal Victor, were in possession of the Guadiana,\r\nand had their advanced posts as forward as Los Santos. Sebastiani\r\nwas at Ciudad Real, and held in check the army of La Carolina, at\r\nthat time under the command of General Venegas, consisting of about\r\n12,000 men. Ney was in possession of Galicia; Salamanca was held by a\r\nsmall detachment of French troops; St Cyr was at Catalonia with his\r\ncorps of 25,000 men; and Kellermann, who had succeeded to Bessières\r\nin the command of the 6th corps, was at Valladolid. Mortier, with his\r\ncorps,[48] and the Duc d’Abrantès (Junot), with the 8th corps, at\r\nZaragoza. The Portuguese army was totally disorganized, and nearly\r\nannihilated; and the Spanish troops were scarcely able to hold their\r\npositions in the Sierra Morena. The Marquis de la Romana, who had been\r\nwith his corps on the frontiers of Portugal, near Chaves, from the\r\nperiod of the embarkation of the British army at Coruña, in the month\r\nof January, till the month of March, had moved from thence when Soult\r\ninvaded Portugal by Chaves, and afterwards moved towards the Asturias\r\nwith his army, and went himself into that province.”\r\n\r\nThe greeting the Commander-in-Chief received at the hands of the\r\npopulace of Lisbon would have been embarrassing to one possessing\r\na less cool head, but Wellesley knew perfectly well that applause\r\nto-day is apt to become condemnation to-morrow. He was appointed\r\nMarshal-General in the Portuguese Army, which was now placed in the\r\ncapable hands of General Beresford by the British Cabinet, Wellesley’s\r\none second-in-command being Major-General Rowland Hill. According to\r\nhis instructions, “the defence of Portugal you will consider as the\r\nfirst and immediate object of your attention. But, as the security\r\nof Portugal can only be effectually provided for in connection with\r\nthe defence of the Peninsula in the larger sense, his Majesty on this\r\naccount, as well as from the unabated interest he takes in the cause\r\nof Spain, leaves it to your judgment to decide, when your army shall\r\nbe advanced on the frontier of Portugal, how your efforts can be best\r\ncombined with the Spanish, as well as the Portuguese troops, in support\r\nof the common cause. In any movements you may undertake, you will,\r\nhowever, keep in mind that, until you receive further orders, your\r\noperations must necessarily be conducted with especial reference to the\r\nprotection of that country.”\r\n\r\nOf British troops the Commander-in-Chief now had at his disposal\r\n23,455, namely, 18,935 infantry, 4270 cavalry, and 250 attached\r\nto the wagon train; Portugal contributed 16,000 men. Costello, a\r\nnon-commissioned officer of the 95th Rifles, and later a Captain in\r\nthe British Legion, has nothing good to say of the Portuguese troops.\r\nIn his record of the Peninsular War[49] he gives several instances of\r\ntheir unreliability and treacherous nature. One example must suffice:\r\n\r\n“The sanguinary nature of the Portuguese,” he says, “during the whole\r\nperiod of the war was notorious. When crossed or excited, nothing but\r\nthe shedding of blood could allay their passion. It was always with\r\nthe greatest difficulty that we could preserve our French prisoners\r\nfrom being butchered by them, even in cold blood. They would hang upon\r\nthe rear of a detachment with prisoners, like so many carrion birds,\r\nwaiting every opportunity to satiate their love of vengeance, and it\r\nrequired all the firmness and vigilance of our troops to keep them in\r\ncheck. It was well known that even our men fell in stepping between\r\nthem and the French whom they had marked out as victims. Indeed, it was\r\nnot unfrequent for our men to suffer from the consequences of their\r\nferocity, and I myself, while at Vallée, had a narrow escape. I had\r\ncrossed the hills to purchase some necessaries at the quarters of the\r\n52nd Regiment, and on my return fell in with several of the soldiers\r\nof the 3rd Caçadores. One of them, a fierce-looking scoundrel, evinced\r\na great inclination to quarrel, the more particularly as he perceived\r\nthat I was unarmed and alone. Having replied rather sharply to some\r\nabuse they had cast upon the English, by reflecting on their countrymen\r\nin return, he flew into a rage, drew his bayonet, and made a rush at\r\nme, which I avoided by stepping aside, and tripping him head foremost\r\non the ground. I was in the act of seizing his bayonet, when a number\r\nof his comrades came up, to whom he related, in exaggerated terms, the\r\ncause of our disagreement. Before he had half concluded, a general cry\r\narose of ‘Kill the English dog’; and the whole, drawing their bayonets,\r\nwere advancing upon me when a party of the 52nd came up, the tables\r\nwere turned, and the Caçadores fled in all directions.”\r\n\r\nWellesley at once prepared to advance, and had not been at Lisbon a\r\nweek before representations were made to him by the Junta of Spanish\r\nEstremadura for aid in behalf of the southern provinces. He replied\r\nthat until “the enemy who has invaded Portugal shall have been removed”\r\nhe could not hope to lend them the requisite assistance. “The enemy”\r\nconsisted of the corps under Soult and Victor. The army of the former,\r\nwhich had left Coruña and invaded Portugal by Napoleon’s imperative\r\norders, now occupied Oporto. This, the second city in the kingdom\r\nand the centre of the most prosperous district, fell after a gallant\r\nif unscientific resistance on the part of the inhabitants under the\r\nBishop. The Marshal took dire vengeance on the insurgents during the\r\njourney from Galicia, perhaps because he had suffered from the guerilla\r\nwarfare, now almost universal throughout the Peninsula. Victor’s army\r\nwas to take Badajoz and afterwards Seville, while Sebastiani held the\r\nsouth in check. Wellesley decided to attack Soult, which necessitated\r\na march of over eighty miles of difficult country. Leaving two small\r\ndetachments of his own and of Portuguese troops upon the Tagus to\r\nwatch the movements of Victor, he set out with 13,000 British, 9000\r\nPortuguese, and 3000 Germans--25,000 in all.\r\n\r\nThe right column, consisting of 9000 men under Beresford, was sent to\r\nLamego, on the Douro, so as to be ready to cut off Soult’s retreat,\r\nthe left making for Oporto with Wellesley. On the 10th May the cavalry\r\nand advanced guard of the latter crossed the Vouga, hoping to surprise\r\nthe French troops at Albergaria and the neighbouring villages, but the\r\nmovement was not completely successful, although a number of prisoners\r\nand cannon were taken.\r\n\r\nThe advanced guard reached Vendas Novas on the following day, and\r\ndrove in the outposts of the French advanced guard. The latter were\r\nvigorously attacked in the woods and village, and defeated with\r\nconsiderable loss. All this augured well for the ensuing operations,\r\nand on the 12th the vanguard reached the southern bank of the Douro.\r\nThe French were stationed on the opposite bank, having taken the\r\nprecaution to burn the bridge after crossing, and to withdraw all the\r\nboats they could discover.\r\n\r\nUnfortunate in this matter, Wellesley was favoured in another. His\r\narmy was screened by cliffs and a hill called the Serra. This bold\r\nrock was surmounted by a Franciscan convent, where the Commander\r\nposted batteries and made his observations. As the river winds a great\r\ndeal, his movements were unobserved by those on the look-out at the\r\nFrench headquarters, to the left of Wellesley as he peered through his\r\nglass across the wide waterway. He had already perceived an extensive\r\nbuilding, known as the Seminary, surrounded by high walls with but one\r\nentrance on the landward side, and open to the river. This he knew\r\nwould be an excellent position to secure, especially as it was almost\r\nopposite to him.\r\n\r\nThere was in the army a certain Colonel Waters, a keen-eyed officer\r\nwith an infinite amount of resource and a ready wit. He contended that\r\nit was scarcely probable that Soult could have secured every boat, and\r\ninterrogated a refugee on the point. He found that the man had crossed\r\nin a small skiff.[50] With the aid of the prior of Amarante, the\r\nfugitive, and several peasants, he heaved the boat out of the mud, and,\r\ncrossing the stream, brought back a number of barges. In these three\r\ncompanies of the Buffs, under Lieut.-General Paget, effected a landing\r\non the opposite side. This excellent officer was seriously wounded\r\nalmost immediately afterward, but the passage of the Douro had been\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nGeneral Murray, who had been ordered to cross at Barca d’Avintas, also\r\nmanaged to get over, and signally failed to check the retiring columns\r\nafter the battle. As additional troops gained the opposite shore the\r\nFrench made repeated attempts to hurl them back, but were ultimately\r\nobliged to retreat “in the utmost confusion” towards Amarante.\r\nAccording to a letter from General Stewart to his brother, Lord\r\nCastlereagh, the French fled with such haste that “Sir Arthur Wellesley\r\ndined at their headquarters on the dinner which had been prepared for\r\nMarshal Soult.”\r\n\r\nOn the 19th May, Soult was across the frontier, having been compelled\r\nto abandon over fifty guns and his baggage. In making his way across\r\nthe Sierra Catalina to escape the pursuing troops, his rear-guard was\r\ndefeated at Salamonde, with severe loss. He eventually reached Orense,\r\nin Galicia, minus some 5000 men, including the sick and wounded he had\r\nleft behind him in Oporto.\r\n\r\n“The road from Penafiel to Montealegre,” says Wellesley, “is strewed\r\nwith the carcases of horses and mules, and of French soldiers, who were\r\nput to death by the peasantry before our advanced guard could save\r\nthem. This last circumstance is the natural effect of the species of\r\nwarfare which the enemy have carried on in this country. Their soldiers\r\nhave plundered and murdered the peasantry at their pleasure; and I\r\nhave seen many persons hanging in the trees by the sides of the road,\r\nexecuted for no reason that I could learn, excepting that they have not\r\nbeen friendly to the French invasion and usurpation of the government\r\nof their country; and the route of their column, on their retreat,\r\ncould be traced by the smoke of the villages to which they set fire.”\r\n\r\nWithin a fortnight Wellesley was writing of the defects of his own men.\r\n“I have long been of opinion,” he says, “that a British army could\r\nbear neither success nor failure, and I have had manifest proofs of\r\nthe truth of this opinion in the first of its branches in the recent\r\nconduct of the soldiers of this army. They have plundered the country\r\nmost terribly, which has given me the greatest concern....\r\n\r\n“They have plundered the people of bullocks, among other property, for\r\nwhat reason I am sure I do not know, except it be, as I understand\r\nis their practice, to sell them to the people again. I shall be very\r\nmuch obliged to you if you will mention this practice to the Ministers\r\nof the Regency, and bid them to issue a proclamation forbidding the\r\npeople, in the most positive terms, to purchase any thing from the\r\nsoldiers of the British army.”\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief relates the same terrible facts to Castlereagh.\r\n“The army behave terribly ill,” is his expression. “They are a rabble\r\nwho cannot bear success any more than Sir J. Moore’s army could bear\r\nfailure. I am endeavoring to tame them; but, if I should not succeed, I\r\nmust make an official complaint of them, and send one or two corps home\r\nin disgrace. They plunder in all directions.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Victor, far from taking Badajoz and marching on Seville as\r\nthe Emperor wished, had found it necessary to move in the direction\r\nof Madrid, where he could secure much needed assistance. He therefore\r\ntook up his position at Talavera. Wellesley, intent upon crushing him,\r\narrived at Abrantes about the same time as the Marshal was evacuating\r\nEstremadura and consequently abandoning the fruits of his victory over\r\nCuesta at Medellin. For Wellesley to have followed Victor with the\r\nrelatively few men at his disposal would have been to court disaster,\r\nand he therefore acquiesced in a new plan of operations suggested\r\nby Cuesta, in which the Spaniards were to be given an opportunity\r\nof showing their capabilities or proving their incapacity. This,\r\nsays Professor Oman, was “the first and only campaign which he ever\r\nundertook in company with a Spanish colleague and without supreme\r\ncontrol over the whole conduct of affairs.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTalavera\r\n\r\n(1809)\r\n\r\n  “_The battle of Talavera was the hardest fought of modern times._”\r\n\r\n            WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe potentialities of the new project were distinctly promising. After\r\nuniting with Cuesta, Wellesley was to follow the course of the Tagus\r\nand cut off Victor’s army of 33,000 troops while the attention of\r\nSebastiani and Joseph Bonaparte, who had but 17,000 men all told, was\r\noccupied by Venegas.\r\n\r\nWhen last heard of Soult and Ney were in Galicia busily engaged in\r\nsuppressing an insurrection, so no opposition was anticipated from\r\nthem. In this matter after events proved the facts to be far different\r\nfrom the surmise. There seemed every likelihood of a successful issue\r\nprovided there was no snapping of individual links of the chain of\r\noperations. Wellesley did not find Cuesta a particularly affable\r\ncolleague, but he was not the man to assert his own opinion unless he\r\nthought it imperative. He characterized him as having “no military\r\ngenius,” which is certainly more favourable than “that deformed-looking\r\nlump of pride, ignorance, and treachery,” which is the description\r\ngiven to us by Costello. “He was,” the latter adds, “the most\r\nmurderous-looking old man I ever saw.” They came together at Oropesa\r\non the 20th July, their forces totalling 55,000, of which 35,000 were\r\nSpanish. It was the task of Venegas and his 26,000 men to approach\r\nMadrid from the south, and, by a demonstration in force, distract\r\nthe attention of Sebastiani. He proved far too slow, and ere he was\r\nable to interfere, Victor, Sebastiani, and Joseph concentrated in the\r\nneighbourhood of Toledo. On the 26th July the last batch of their\r\n50,000 troops came together.\r\n\r\nHad Wellesley been allowed to attack on the 23rd July, as he wished,\r\nit is probable that he would have crushed Victor, whose reinforcements\r\ndid not begin to arrive until the following day. Cuesta had already\r\nshown his incompetency, and some of his advanced guard had been roughly\r\nhandled by a French cavalry division. It was Wellesley’s opinion\r\nthat the psychological moment had arrived, but the Spanish commander\r\nobjected. “Had we fought then,” Wellesley afterwards averred, “it\r\nwould have been as great a battle as Waterloo, and would have cleared\r\nSpain of the French for that time.” The formidable task before him was\r\nnot made lighter by the knowledge that the commissariat and transport\r\narrangements had utterly broken down.\r\n\r\nAt Talavera, evacuated by Victor, who moved a few miles to the east,\r\nWellesley was obliged to halt, and even threatened to withdraw from\r\nSpain because of the ill-treatment accorded his famishing troops. “I\r\nhave never seen an army,” he says, “so ill-treated in any country, or,\r\nconsidering that all depends upon its operations, one which deserved\r\ngood treatment so much. It is ridiculous to pretend that the country\r\ncannot supply our wants. The French army is well fed, and the soldiers\r\nwho are taken in good health, and well supplied with bread, of which\r\nindeed they left a small magazine behind them. This is a rich country\r\nin corn, in comparison with Portugal, and yet, during the whole of my\r\noperations in that country, we never wanted bread but on one day on\r\nthe frontiers of Galicia. In the Vera de Plasencia there are means to\r\nsupply this army for 4 months, as I am informed, and yet the alcaldes\r\nhave not performed their engagements with me. The Spanish army has\r\nplenty of every thing, and we alone, upon whom every thing depends, are\r\nactually starving.”\r\n\r\nAfter considerable trouble Cuesta consented to Wellesley assuming\r\nsupreme command of the combined forces. On the afternoon of the\r\n27th the British General mounted his horse and, accompanied by his\r\nstaff, rode out of the town to an old château, known as the Casa de\r\nSalinas. His object was to obtain a bird’s-eye view from the roof of\r\nthe movements of the enemy on the Alberche. He apprehended no danger,\r\nbecause Spanish troops occupied the adjacent woods. In this he was\r\ndeceived, for a number of French _tirailleurs_ suddenly appearing, the\r\ntroops beat a hasty retreat. The Commander-in-Chief jumped from the\r\nwall and regained his horse not a moment too soon. Had it not been for\r\nthe near presence of a body of English infantry, who immediately opened\r\nfire, it is extremely probable that Wellington and his staff would have\r\nbeen captured.\r\n\r\nAt five o’clock the opposing forces were within touch, the French\r\nhaving crossed the river and driven in the British piquets, who lost\r\nabout 400 men.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest descriptions of the ensuing battle--or more\r\ncorrectly, series of battles--is that of Captain M. de Rocca, a French\r\nofficer of Hussars, which has the advantage of giving the point of view\r\nof the enemy, and how Wellesley was regarded by one at least of his\r\ncombatants.\r\n\r\n“The Spaniards,” he says, “were posted in a situation deemed\r\nimpregnable, behind old walls and garden-fences, which border and\r\nencompass the city of Talavera.[51] Their right was defended by the\r\nTagus, and their left joined the English, near a redoubt constructed\r\non an eminence. The ground in front of the Anglo-Spanish armies was\r\nvery unequal, and intersected here and there by ravines, formed by the\r\nrains of winter. The whole extent of their position was covered by the\r\nchannel of a pretty deep torrent, at that time dry. The English left\r\nwas strengthened by a conical eminence that commanded the greater part\r\nof the field of battle, and which was separated by a deep extensive\r\nvalley from the Castilian chain of mountains.\r\n\r\n“This eminence was thus in a manner the key to the enemy’s position,\r\nand against this decisive point of attack, an experienced general,\r\npossessed of that intuitive glance which insures success, would\r\nimmediately have led the principal part of his disposable force, to\r\nobtain possession of it. He would either have taken it by assault,\r\nor have turned it by the valley. But King Joseph, when he should\r\nhave acted, was seized with an unfortunate spirit of indecision and\r\nuncertainty. He attempted only half measures, he distributed his forces\r\npartially, and lost the opportunity of conquering while feeling the way\r\nfor it. Marshal Jourdan, the second in command, had not that spur of\r\npatriotism in the Spanish war, which inspired him when he fought in the\r\nplains of Fleurus, to achieve the independence of France.\r\n\r\n“The French commenced the engagement by a cannonade and rifle-fire in\r\nadvance of their right; and they despatched a single battalion only,\r\nand some sharp-shooters, by the valley, to take the eminence which\r\ndefended the English left, never thinking they would do otherwise\r\nthan yield. This battalion, however, having to contend with superior\r\nnumbers, was repulsed with loss, and compelled to retire. A division of\r\ndragoons, which had gone to reconnoitre Talavera, found the approaches\r\nto that city strongly fortified with artillery, and could not advance.\r\n\r\n“At nightfall, the French made another attempt to gain the hill. A\r\nregiment of infantry, followed at a short distance by two others,\r\nattacked the extreme left of the English with unexampled ardour,\r\narrived at the summit of the hill, and took possession of it. But\r\nhaving been fiercely assaulted, in its turn, by an entire division\r\nof the English, just, when having conquered, it was breathless with\r\nexertion, it was immediately obliged to give way. One of the two\r\nregiments, commanded to assist in this attack, had lost its way in a\r\nwood on account of the darkness; the other not getting soon enough over\r\nthe ravine, which covered the enemy’s position, had not arrived in time.\r\n\r\n“Both these attacks had miscarried, though conducted with intrepid\r\nbravery, because they had been made by an inadequate number of\r\ntroops. A single battalion had been sent, and then one division, when\r\na great proportion of the whole army should have been despatched.\r\nThese unsuccessful attempts revealed to the English what we designed\r\nnext day; and still more evidently demonstrated the importance of\r\nthe station they held. They passed the greater part of the night in\r\nfortifying it with artillery.\r\n\r\n“The sun rose next morning on the two armies drawn up in battle order,\r\nand again the cannonade commenced. The defence of Portugal being\r\nentrusted to the English army, the fate of that country, and, perhaps,\r\nof all the Peninsula, was now to be decided by this contest. The\r\nveterans of the first and fourth French corps, accustomed for years to\r\nconquer throughout Europe, and always to witness their ardour seconded\r\nby the combined skill of their chiefs, burned with impatience for\r\norders to engage, and thought to overthrow all before them by one well\r\nconjoined assault.\r\n\r\n“One division alone, of three regiments of infantry, was sent by the\r\nvalley to storm the position, of which we had, for a moment, obtained\r\npossession the preceding evening. After considerable loss, this\r\ndivision reached the top of the eminence, and was just about taking\r\nit. One of the regiments had already advanced as far as the artillery,\r\nwhen their charge was repulsed, and the whole division was forced to\r\nretire. The English, apprehending by this renewed attack that the\r\nFrench designed to turn their left by the valley, stationed their\r\ncavalry there; and caused a division of the Spaniards to occupy the\r\nskirts of the high Castilian mountains beyond it. The French receded\r\nto the ground they first occupied. The cannonade continued for another\r\nhour, and then became gradually silent. The overpowering heat of\r\nmid-day obliged both armies to suspend the combat, and observe a kind\r\nof involuntary truce, during which the wounded were removed.\r\n\r\n“King Joseph, having at last gone himself to reconnoitre the enemy’s\r\nposition, gave orders, at four o’clock, for a general attack against\r\nthe army of England. A division of dragoons was left to observe the\r\nSpaniards in the direction of Talavera. General Sebastiani’s corps\r\nmarched against the right of the English, while Marshal Victor’s three\r\ndivisions of infantry, followed by masses of cavalry, charged against\r\ntheir left, to attack the eminence by the valley. King Joseph and\r\nMarshal Jourdan took part with the reserve, in the rear of the 4th\r\ndivision. The artillery and musketry were not long in being heard.\r\n\r\n“The English Commander, stationed on the hill which overlooked the\r\nfield of battle, was present always where danger demanded his presence.\r\nHe could survey, at a glance, every corps of his army, and perceive\r\nbelow him the least movement of the French. He saw the line of battle\r\nformed, the columns disposed for the conflict; he penetrated their\r\ndesigns by their arrangements, and thus had time to order his plans,\r\nso as to penetrate and prevent those of his foes. The position of the\r\nEnglish army was naturally strong and difficult of approach, both in\r\nfront and flank; but in the rear it was quite accessible, and gave\r\nample freedom to their troops to hasten to the quarter threatened.\r\n\r\n“The French had a ravine to pass before they could reach the enemy.\r\nThey had to advance over ground much intersected, very rugged and\r\nunequal, obliging them frequently to break their line; and the\r\npositions they attacked had been previously fortified. The left\r\ncould not see the right, or know what was passing there, for the\r\nrising ground between them. Every corps of the army fought apart,\r\nwith unparalleled bravery, and ability too, but there was no\r\nco-operation in their efforts. The French were not then commanded by a\r\nGeneral-in-chief, the resources of whose genius might have compensated\r\nfor the advantages which the nature of the ground denied them and\r\nyielded to their enemies.\r\n\r\n“The division of Lapisse first passed the ravine, attacked the\r\nfortified eminence, ascended it in defiance of a fire of grape-shot\r\nwhich mowed down its ranks, but was repulsed with the loss of its\r\nGeneral and a great number of officers and soldiers. In retreating,\r\nit left the right of the fourth corps uncovered, which the British\r\nartillery took in flank, and forced for a moment to retire. The left\r\nof General Sebastiani’s corps advanced under a most intense fire of\r\nartillery to the fort of a redoubt on the right of the English, and\r\nbetween the combined armies. It was too far advanced, and too soon\r\nforward--it was encountered and driven back by the united corps of the\r\nEnglish right and the Spanish left. Assistance came, and the combat\r\nwas renewed. In the centre, Marshal Victor rallied the division of\r\nLapisse at the foot of the hill, and abandoned all further attempt to\r\ngain possession of it. The French then tried to turn it either by the\r\nright or left. Villatte’s division advanced in the valley, and Ruffin’s\r\nmoved to the right of this by the foot of the Castilian mountains.\r\nThe cavalry, forming a second line, were in readiness to debouch into\r\nthe plain in the rear of the enemy whenever the infantry could open a\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n“Just as the French began to move, the English, with two regiments\r\nof cavalry, made a charge against their masses. They engaged in the\r\nvalley, passed onwards regardless of the fire of several battalions\r\nof infantry, between the divisions of Villatte and Ruffin, and fell\r\nwith impetuosity never surpassed on the 10th and 26th regiments of\r\nour chasseurs. The 10th could not resist the charge. They opened their\r\nranks, but rallied immediately, and nearly the whole of the 23rd\r\nregiment of light dragoons at the head of the English cavalry was\r\neither destroyed or taken captive.\r\n\r\n“A division of the English Royal Guards, stationed on the left and\r\ncentre of their army, being charged by the French, at first repulsed\r\nthem vigorously; but one of its brigades, being too far advanced, was\r\nin its turn taken in flank by the fire of the French artillery and\r\ninfantry, sustained considerable loss, and retreated with difficulty\r\nbehind their second line. The French took advantage of this success;\r\nthey again moved forward, and but one other effort was necessary to\r\nbreak through into the plain, and combat on equal ground. But King\r\nJoseph thought it was too late to advance with the reserve, and the\r\nattack was delayed till the following day.[52] Night again closed over\r\nus, and the conflict ceased from exhaustion, without either side having\r\nwon such a decided advantage as to entitle it to claim the victory.\r\n\r\n“The corps of Marshals Victor and Sebastiani withdrew successively\r\nduring the night towards the reserve, leaving an advanced guard of\r\ncavalry on the scene of the engagement, to take care of the wounded.\r\nThe English, who expected a new attack in the morning, were greatly\r\nsurprised when day dawned to see that their enemies, leaving twenty\r\npieces of cannon, had retreated to their old position on the Alberche.\r\nThe English and Spaniards, according to their own accounts, lost 6,616\r\nmen.[53] The French had nearly 10,000 slain.”\r\n\r\nWellesley characterizes the battle as “a most desperate one ... we had\r\nabout two to one against us; fearful odds! but we maintained all our\r\npositions, and gave the enemy a terrible beating.” Very few of the\r\nSpanish troops were engaged in any real sense, although those who took\r\nan active part behaved well, and one of the cavalry regiments “made\r\nan excellent and well-timed charge.” The majority of them were in a\r\n“miserable state of discipline” and “entirely incapable of performing\r\nany manœuvre, however simple.” There was a sad lack of _morale_,\r\nqualified officers were few, and seemed either unable or unwilling to\r\nfollow their allies in the matter of subjecting their men to definite\r\nregulations. When the British soldiers were engaged in removing\r\nthe wounded and in burying the dead after Talavera, “the arms and\r\naccoutrements of both were collected and carried away by the Spanish\r\ntroops.”\r\n\r\nThe exhausted condition of his army prevented Wellesley from following\r\nthe enemy, but as Venegas was on the move and threatening Madrid, this\r\nwas not regarded as of consummate importance. Of more immediate concern\r\nwas the alarming intelligence received by the Commander-in-Chief a few\r\nhours later that Soult’s army was no longer in Galicia, but marching to\r\nintercept the British communications with Portugal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWellesley’s Defence of Portugal\r\n\r\n(1809-10)\r\n\r\n  “_If I fail, God will, I hope, have mercy upon me, for nobody else\r\n  will._”\r\n\r\n            WELLESLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoult, joined by Mortier and Ney, had some 50,000 men with which to\r\nface the victor of Talavera. Had Cuesta guarded the mountain passes as\r\nhe was supposed to do, Wellesley would not have found himself in so\r\nawkward a predicament. Both his front and rear were threatened, the\r\nformer by Victor and Sebastiani and the latter by Soult. While his\r\nranks were sadly depleted, those of the French were augmented. By great\r\ngood fortune General Craufurd and his celebrated Light Division arrived\r\non the morning of the 29th July, the day following the conclusion of\r\nthe battle.\r\n\r\nRumour proved on this occasion a powerful ally of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, for had not Craufurd heard of the supposed death\r\nof Sir Arthur, it is scarcely likely that he would have urged his men,\r\neach loaded with forty pounds weight on his back, to march forty-three\r\nEnglish miles in twenty-two hours. Wellesley made up his mind to\r\nadvance against Soult, but was forced to abandon the idea when he\r\nheard that the enemy had entered Plasencia in great force, thereby\r\nsevering the British communications with Lisbon. A retreat “to take up\r\nthe defensive line of the Tagus” became eminently necessary. “We were\r\nin a bad scrape,” he writes on the 8th August, “from which I think I\r\nhave extricated both armies; and I really believe that, if I had not\r\ndetermined to retire at the moment I did, all retreat would have been\r\ncut off for both.” “Both,” of course, includes the Spaniards, whose\r\n“train of mismanagement,” added to Soult’s advance, were contributing\r\ncauses of his withdrawal.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards promised to remain at Talavera to watch the movements of\r\nthe enemy and to assist the wounded. No sooner was Wellesley out of the\r\nway than Cuesta felt that the position was untenable, with the result\r\nthat many British soldiers, rendered unable to keep up with the Spanish\r\ntroops by reason of their wounds, were made prisoners by Victor, who\r\nsoon afterwards took possession of the town.\r\n\r\nThe Tagus was crossed at Arzobispo, and a rearguard of 8000 Spaniards,\r\nunder Cuesta, left to defend the passage. At Almarez the bridge of\r\nboats was broken to arrest Soult’s advance from Naval Moral, no great\r\ndistance away, and on the high road. As it happened, the French\r\nMarshal was able to cross the river at Arzobispo by means of a ford.\r\nHe promptly defeated the Spanish force there and captured their guns.\r\nNot a few of the defenders fled, throwing away their arms and clothing,\r\na very usual device. This was followed by the defeat of Venegas by\r\nJoseph and Sebastiani at Almonacid, near Toledo, where several thousand\r\nmen were either killed, wounded, or captured, and of a Portuguese and\r\nSpanish column which had been detached from the main army, under Sir\r\nRobert Wilson, by Ney at the Puerto de Baños.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of August 1809 the various armies were occupying the\r\nfollowing positions: British, Jaraicejo; Eguia, Deleytosa; Vanegas, La\r\nCarolina; Ney, Salamanca; Kellermann, Valladolid; Soult, Plasencia;\r\nMortier, Oropesa and Arzobispo; Victor, Talavera and Toledo;\r\nSebastiani, La Mancha.\r\n\r\nThe storm was followed by a lull, for the contesting armies were all\r\nbut worn out and required rest. Wellesley made his headquarters\r\nfirst at Deleytosa, and, when that place was vacated on the 11th, at\r\nJaraicejo; the Spanish made the former town their headquarters, and the\r\nPortuguese army, under Beresford, withdrew within their home frontier.\r\n\r\n“While the army remained in this position,” namely, Deleytosa, General\r\nSir George T. Napier records: “We suffered dreadfully from want of\r\nfood; nothing but a small portion of unground wheat and (when we could\r\n_catch them_) about a quarter of a pound of old goats’ flesh each man;\r\nno salt, bread, or wine; and as the Spaniards had plundered the baggage\r\nof the British army during the battle of Talavera, there was nothing\r\nof any kind to be procured to help us out, such as tea or sugar.”[54]\r\nThese defects the General determined to remedy, for “no troops can\r\nserve to any good purpose unless they are regularly fed,” a maxim\r\nequivalent to that of Napoleon that “an army moves on its stomach.”\r\n\r\nCuesta resigned his command, which was given to Eguia, but from\r\nhenceforth the British Commander placed his sole reliance on his own\r\nforces. The lack of co-operation in the combined army was also evident\r\nin that of the French, for the various marshals had separated, and, to\r\nNapoleon’s disgust, lost a golden opportunity of crushing the hated\r\nEnglish, which was never again vouchsafed to them. “Force Wellesley\r\nto fight on every possible occasion,” was his frequent cry. “Win if\r\nyou can, but lose a battle rather than deliver none. We can afford to\r\nexpend three men for every one he loses, and you will thus wear him\r\nout in the end.” Wellesley preferred to conserve his energy, not to\r\nsquander it.\r\n\r\nAfter repeated requests for provisions and means of transport, all\r\nmore or less evasively answered by the Spanish authorities, Wellesley\r\ncarried out his threat and fell back upon the frontiers of Portugal.\r\nNot without a certain suggestion of irony, he was at this time\r\nappointed a Captain-General in the Spanish service, and received six\r\nAndalusian horses “in the name of King Ferdinand the VIIth.” Shortly\r\nafterwards he was notified that he had been elevated to the Peerage,\r\nwith the titles of Baron Douro of Wellesley, and Viscount Wellington of\r\nTalavera. From henceforth we shall style him Wellington, a signature he\r\nfirst adopted on the 16th September 1809.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” he writes from Merida, on the 25th August, to Castlereagh,\r\n“can be worse than the officers of the Spanish army; and it is\r\nextraordinary that when a nation has devoted itself to war, as this\r\nnation has, by the measures it has adopted in the last two years,\r\nso little progress has been made in any one branch of the military\r\nprofession by any individual, and that the business of an army should\r\nbe so little understood. They are really children in the art of war,\r\nand I cannot say that they do any thing as it ought to be done, with\r\nthe exception of running away and assembling again in a state of\r\nnature.” In his opinion the Portuguese, under English officers, were\r\nbetter than the Spaniards, but both “want the habits and spirit of\r\nsoldiers--the habits of command on one side, and of obedience on the\r\nother--mutual confidence between officers and men; and, above all, a\r\ndetermination in the superiors to obey the spirit of the orders they\r\nreceive, let what will be the consequence, and the spirit to tell the\r\ntrue cause if they do not. In short, the fact is, there is so much\r\ntrick in the Portuguese army....”\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of September he was at Badajoz, on the frontier,\r\nthe advantage being, as Wellington says, “that the British army was\r\ncentrically posted, in reference to all the objects which the enemy\r\nmight have in view; and at any time, by a junction with a Spanish corps\r\non its right, or a Portuguese or Spanish corps on its left, it could\r\nprevent the enemy from undertaking any thing, excepting with a much\r\nlarger force than they could allot to any one object.” Here he heard\r\nthat there was a likelihood of Soult attacking Ciudad Rodrigo. This\r\ninformation he obtained from an intercepted letter to Joseph. “The\r\nsuccess of this scheme,” he avers, “would do them more good, and the\r\nallies more mischief, than any other they could attempt; and it is most\r\nlikely of all others to be successful.” For this reason he ordered\r\nWilson to stay north of the Tagus so as to watch Soult’s movements.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the month the Spanish army of Estremadura, stationed\r\nat Deleytosa, was reduced to 6000 soldiers, the remainder, with Eguia,\r\nmarching towards La Mancha. About the same time an army of some 13,000\r\nmen, under La Romana, whom Wellington describes as “more intelligent\r\nand reasonable” than most of his countrymen, moved from Galicia to\r\nthe neighbourhood of Ciudad Rodrigo. La Romana himself proceeded to\r\nSeville and was succeeded by the Duque del Parque, who marched towards\r\nSalamanca.\r\n\r\nWellington watched del Parque’s forward movements with dismay, and\r\nordered magazines to be prepared upon the Douro and Mondego “to assist\r\nin providing for these vagabonds if they should retire into Portugal,\r\nwhich I hope they will do, as their only chance of salvation.”\r\n\r\nOn the 10th October Wellington was at Lisbon to arrange future\r\noperations, and where he studied “on the ground” the possibility of\r\ndefending Portugal. This reconnaissance resulted in the defence known\r\nas the “Lines of Torres Vedras,” of which particulars will be given as\r\nthe story proceeds.[55]\r\n\r\nBy the end of the month he was back at Badajoz, writing endless\r\ndispatches relative to the thousand and one concerns--military,\r\npolitical and financial--of the two armies. By the beginning of\r\nNovember del Parque was obliged to retire owing to the arrival from\r\nEstremadura of some 36,000 men under Mortier in Old Castile. Eguia’s\r\nentry into La Mancha from Estremadura two months before had been\r\nfollowed by the arrival of 30,000 of the enemy’s troops under Victor\r\nin that province, whereupon the Spanish commander had withdrawn to the\r\nSierra Morena, and the French to the Tagus.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Government now entertained the hope of gaining the complete\r\npossession of Madrid. Two forces were to be honoured with the carrying\r\nout of this ambitious project. The army of La Mancha, now under the\r\ninexperienced General Areizaga, joined by the greater part of the army\r\nof Estremadura, and consisting of 50,000 men, was to march from the\r\nSierra Morena. Del Parque, with the army of Galicia, 20,000 strong, was\r\nto take Salamanca and then present himself before the capital. Areizaga\r\nmet with some temporary success, but on the 19th November some 4000\r\nof his men were either lying dead or wounded on the bloody field of\r\nOcaña, within easy distance of Madrid. No fewer than 18,000 were taken\r\nprisoners by King Joseph’s troops. When the distressed General gathered\r\ntogether the fragments of his shattered army in the Sierra Morena, only\r\na half of the original number were present, which means that 3000 had\r\ndeserted. He must have been sadly deficient in cannon, for the French\r\nhad captured over fifty pieces.\r\n\r\nDel Parque was scarcely more successful. He was attacked at Tamames\r\non the 19th October by troops under Marchand, whom he defeated. Thus\r\nencouraged, he advanced to Salamanca, which the French had occupied,\r\nand taken possession of. In the last week of November he was beaten\r\nat Alba de Tormes, to which he had retreated, with a loss of 3000\r\nmen. Some of his troops retired on Galicia, the remainder on Ciudad\r\nRodrigo.[56]\r\n\r\nWith the object of giving the Spanish Government time to repair their\r\nlosses in southern Spain, and surmising that whatever reinforcements\r\nthe French might receive would be for use against the British now that\r\nthe armies under Blake, Areizaga, and del Parque were scattered,\r\nWellington prepared to move the greater part of his army north of the\r\nTagus, towards the frontiers of Castile, but leaving a body of troops\r\nunder Lieutenant-General Hill at Abrantes, so that the Lower Tagus\r\nmight not be left unguarded. Early in January 1810, Wellington made\r\nhis headquarters at Coimbra, on the Mondego, and within comparatively\r\neasy distance of the sea, conceivably a useful ally now that Napoleon\r\nwas sending additional reinforcements, and Soult had 70,000 men at his\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nThe passes of Despeña Perros, and Puerto del Rey through the Sierra\r\nMorena, but weakly defended by Spanish troops under Areizaga, were\r\nforced by the French without difficulty. On the last day of January\r\n1810, Seville capitulated. That Wellington anticipated this is proved\r\nby a letter he wrote on that date to Lord Liverpool. Cadiz was saved\r\nfrom a similar fate by the Duke of Albuquerque, who reached the city\r\nin the nick of time, although Victor’s outposts had been seen on the\r\nbanks of the Guadalquivir. Major-General the Hon. W. Stewart was sent\r\nto assist in the defence of the place, and arrived towards the end of\r\nFebruary with some 5000 British and Portuguese troops, while a British\r\nfleet lay in the Bay.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Wellington was able to report considerable progress in\r\nsome of the regiments in the Portuguese army, thanks very largely to\r\nthe exertions of Marshal Beresford. Fifteen regiments he had seen\r\nwhile marching from Badajoz to Coimbra showed decided improvement in\r\ndiscipline, and he had “no doubt that the whole will prove an useful\r\nacquisition to the country.” They were “in general unhealthy.” The\r\nconduct of his own troops was “infamous” when not under the inspection\r\nof officers. “They have never brought up a convoy of money that they\r\nhave not robbed the chest; nor of shoes, or any other article that\r\ncould be of use to them, or could produce money, that they do not steal\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Walcheren Expedition[57] not only led to a\r\nduel between Canning and Castlereagh and the fall of Portland’s\r\nadministration, but caused the British public to lose faith in things\r\nmilitary. It seemed not at all improbable that the new Ministry formed\r\nby Perceval, in which Lord Wellesley became Foreign Secretary, and\r\nLord Liverpool Secretary for War and the Colonies, would withdraw the\r\nBritish army from the Peninsula, especially as Talavera had aroused\r\nlittle or no enthusiasm, and a retreat was regarded by the man in\r\nthe street as scarcely better than a defeat. In this connexion it\r\nis interesting to note that when Wellington was asked what was the\r\nbest test of a great general, he gave as his answer, “To know when to\r\nretreat; and to dare to do it.” Aware of the state of public opinion,\r\nhe did not press for further reinforcements.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the Rt. Hon. John Villiers, dated Viseu, 14th January\r\n1810, the Commander-in-Chief definitely states “that in its present\r\nstate” the army was “not sufficient for the defence of Portugal.” He\r\nanticipated having 30,000 effective British troops when the soldiers\r\nthen on their way from England and those in hospital were available:\r\n“I will fight a good battle for the possession of Portugal, and see\r\nwhether that country cannot be saved from the general wreck.”\r\n\r\n“I conceive,” he concludes, “that the honor and interests of the\r\ncountry require that we should hold our ground here as long as\r\npossible; and, please God, I will maintain it as long as I can; and I\r\nwill neither endeavor to shift from my own shoulders on those of the\r\nMinisters the responsibility for the failure, by calling for means\r\nwhich I know they cannot give, and which, perhaps, would not add\r\nmaterially to the facility of attaining our object; nor will I give to\r\nthe Ministers, who are not strong, and who must feel the delicacy of\r\ntheir own situation, an excuse for withdrawing the army from a position\r\nwhich, in my opinion, the honor and interest of the country require\r\nthey should maintain as long as possible.\r\n\r\n“I think that if the Portuguese do their duty, I shall have enough to\r\nmaintain it; if they do not, nothing that Great Britain can afford can\r\nsave the country; and if from that cause I fail in saving it, and am\r\nobliged to go, I shall be able to carry away the British army.”\r\n\r\nThe war in Spain still continued see-saw fashion. A province would be\r\napparently conquered by Napoleon’s troops when no sooner did the troops\r\nmarch on than the trouble began again. This happened more especially\r\nwith Suchet in Aragon. In Catalonia the intrepid O’Donnell and his men\r\nflitted about like a will-o’-the-wisp and worked sad havoc whenever\r\nthey came across a detached force, though Hostalrich fell and Lerida\r\nsurrendered in May, as well as the castle of Mequinenza a little later.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had not been sleeping. In the previous year he had been too\r\noccupied in humbling Austria and annexing Rome and the Ecclesiastical\r\nStates to give much attention to the Peninsula. He now placed Marshal\r\nMasséna, Prince of Essling, who by reason of his success was known\r\nas “the spoilt child of victory”--incidentally he was the son of an\r\ninn-keeper--in command of 180,000 troops, for which purpose he arrived\r\nat Valladolid in the middle of May 1810. Within a month the French\r\nforces in Spain were raised to no fewer than 366,000 men of all ranks\r\nand arms.\r\n\r\nSurely “the heir of Charlemagne,” as Napoleon termed himself, was on\r\nthe point of crushing the resistance of the Iberian Peninsula, and\r\nwith it insignificant Portugal and Wellington? Was it feasible that\r\n60,000 British, Germans, and Portuguese, sometimes aided but more often\r\nhindered by an “insurgent” rabble, and indirectly by the two remaining\r\nSpanish armies in Galicia and Estremadura, could contest with any\r\nlikelihood of success more than a third of a million of trained troops?\r\nThe law of probability answered in the negative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nThe Lines of Torres Vedras\r\n\r\n(1810)\r\n\r\n  “_France is not an enemy whom I despise, nor does it deserve I\r\n  should._”\r\n\r\n            WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nPasquier, who had the privilege of knowing most of the generals of the\r\nRevolution and of the Empire, says of Masséna that he was “France’s\r\nfirst military commander after Napoleon.” Neither Pichegru, Moreau,\r\nKléber, nor Lannes gave the Chancellor “as completely as Masséna, the\r\nidea of a born warrior, possessing a genius for war, and endowed with\r\nall the qualities which render victory certain. His eagle eye seemed\r\nmade to scan a field of battle. One could understand, on seeing him,\r\nthat the soldier under his command never believed it was possible to\r\nretreat.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “You are too young, sir, to be killed!”\r\n\r\nThomas Maybank]\r\n\r\nMasséna’s first important operation in the Peninsula was the siege of\r\nthe Spanish fortress of Ciudad Rodrigo. Although Wellington was in\r\nthe neighbourhood he was not to be enticed away from his immediate\r\nobjects, which were the defence of Lisbon and the thorough organization\r\nof the army for service when action became absolutely imperative.\r\nNotwithstanding a splendid defence for over two months on the part of\r\nGovernor Herrasti, the garrison of Ciudad Rodrigo was compelled to\r\nsurrender on the 10th July. In August, Masséna crossed the frontier\r\npreparatory to beginning the siege of Almeida, near the river Coa,\r\nnext to Elvas the strongest place in Portugal.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th July, Craufurd and his famous Light Division--not Light\r\nBrigade as some would have it--had a fierce tussle with Ney’s corps\r\nof 24,000 men. Craufurd, who had only 4000 troops at his disposal,\r\nentertained no wild notion of preventing the investment of the place,\r\nbut as he was suddenly attacked he was obliged to fight. Had he been\r\na more cautious soldier he would have crossed the Coa before Ney came\r\nup, as Wellington had suggested on the 22nd. Indeed, so early as the\r\n11th, the Commander-in-Chief had said, “I would not wish you to fall\r\nback beyond that place (_i.e._ Almeida), unless it should be necessary.\r\nBut it does not appear necessary that you should be so far, and it\r\nwill be safer that you should be nearer, at least with your infantry.”\r\nHe delayed too late, and thereby lost over 300 men. While the last of\r\nthe soldiers were crossing the bridge which spanned the swollen river,\r\nfor it had rained in torrents the previous night, a lanky Irish lad\r\nof nineteen years, named Stewart, and known by the 43rd as “The Boy,”\r\npositively refused to pass over. “So this is the end of our boasting!\r\nThis is our first battle, and we retreat! The Boy Stewart will not\r\nlive to hear that said,” he cried, and turning back he slashed at\r\nthe oncoming French until he fell dead. Even more courageous was the\r\nconduct of Sergeant Robert M‘Quade, five years Stewart’s senior. He\r\nhappened to catch sight of two French soldiers with levelled muskets\r\nawaiting the British to ascend a bank. A boy of sixteen, afterwards\r\nfamous as Sir George Brown (Colonel-in-Chief of the Rifle Brigade) was\r\non the verge of being shot by them when the sergeant pulled him back\r\nfrom the fatal spot. “You are too young, sir, to be killed,” he cried\r\nas his own body received two bullets and fell in a lifeless heap at the\r\nfeet of the youth.\r\n\r\nThat Colonel Cox, who was in charge of the fortress, would have stayed\r\nMasséna’s advance for a considerable time is extremely likely,\r\nbut unfortunately he was not given the opportunity to display his\r\nprowess. The powder-magazine blew up, almost destroying the town and\r\nnecessitating immediate surrender. The pursuit of Wellington, “to drive\r\nhim into the sea,” seemed a comparatively easy task until the advance\r\nshowed that the British General had caused the country to be stripped\r\nalmost entirely of provisions. Thus Napoleon’s policy of making “war\r\nsupport war” by plundering and raiding the enemy’s country, completely\r\nbroke down. “In war all that is useful is legitimate,” he says, and\r\nWellington had followed the maxim, after having obtained permission\r\nfor the destruction of provisions from the Portuguese Regency, which\r\nincluded Mr Charles Stuart, the British Minister at Lisbon. What\r\nWellington’s measures meant to Masséna’s army is summed up in a single\r\nsentence by Sir Harry Smith, who carried a dispatch to Lord Hill\r\nthrough territory occupied by the enemy. “The spectacle,” he says, “of\r\nhundreds of miserable wretches of French soldiers on the road in a\r\nstate of _starvation_ is not to be described.” Nor was this all. Not\r\nonly did the place resemble a desert in the difficulty of obtaining\r\nmeans of sustenance, but the majority of the inhabitants had fled, some\r\nseeking the fastnesses of the mountains, others the larger cities such\r\nas Lisbon and Oporto.\r\n\r\nAs Masséna advanced so Wellington retreated towards the celebrated\r\nlines of Torres Vedras, upon the construction of which thousands of\r\npeasants, under the direction of British engineers, had been busy for\r\nsix months.\r\n\r\nThese magnificent defences are thus described by one who knew them.[58]\r\nThey “consisted of redoubts and field-works of various kinds; according\r\nto the ground they were to defend, and all connected with each other\r\nby entrenchments, etc., so that, when occupied by the army, it would\r\nalmost be impossible to force them. But, even supposing this first line\r\nof defence should be carried by the enemy, there was another, much\r\nmore contracted, to retreat upon, where a very small force could hold\r\nout against the French army and cover the embarkation of the British,\r\nshould Lord Wellington be at last forced to quit Portugal. I cannot\r\nhelp considering this retreat to the lines, and the pertinacity with\r\nwhich he held them in spite of every difficulty, and the remonstrances\r\nof the Government at home, which was seized with alarm, as the greatest\r\nproof of a master mind and genius that could be given, and proved\r\nLord Wellington to be superior to any general the French had, except\r\nNapoleon; in short, that he was, next to Buonaparte himself, the\r\nfirst general of the day. And I am further convinced that, had he the\r\nsame opportunities that Napoleon had, he would have proved as great a\r\ngeneral, as his capacity and powers of mind would have strengthened and\r\nexpanded in proportion to the vastness of his views and the obstacles\r\nto be surmounted.”\r\n\r\nAn officer of the 60th Rifles, who served behind them, furnishes a\r\nmore detailed pen-sketch. “The line of defence was double,” he writes.\r\n“The first, which was twenty-nine miles long, began at Alhandra, on\r\nthe Tagus, crossed the valley of Armia, which was rather a weak point,\r\nand passed along the skirts of Mount Agraça, where there was a large\r\nand strong redoubt; it then passed across the valley of Zibreira, and\r\nskirted the ravine of Runa to the heights of Torres Vedras, which were\r\nwell fortified; and from thence followed the course of the little\r\nriver Zizandre to its mouth on the sea-coast. The line followed the\r\nsinuosities of the mountain track which extends from the Tagus to the\r\nsea, about thirty miles north of Lisbon. Lord Wellington’s headquarters\r\nwere fixed at Pero Negro, a little in the rear of the centre of the\r\nline, where a telegraph was fixed corresponding with every part of the\r\nposition. The second line, at a distance varying from six to ten miles\r\nin the rear of the first, extended from Quintella, on the Tagus, by\r\nBucellas, Montechique, and Mafra, to the mouth of the little river\r\nS. Lourenço, on the sea-coast, and was twenty-four miles long. This\r\nwas the stronger line of the two, both by Nature and art, and if the\r\nfirst line were forced by the enemy, the retreat of the army upon the\r\nsecond was secure at all times. Both lines were secured by breastworks,\r\nabattis, stone walls with banquettes, and scarps. In the rear of the\r\nsecond line there was a line of embarkation, should that measure become\r\nnecessary, enclosing an entrenched camp and the fort of St Julian.” As\r\nmany as 120 redoubts and 427 pieces of artillery were scattered along\r\nthese lines. “Lord Wellington had received reinforcements from England\r\nand Cadiz; the Portuguese army had also been strengthened, and the\r\nSpanish division of La Romana, 5000 strong, came from Estremadura to\r\njoin the Allies;[59] so that the British commander had about 60,000\r\nregular troops posted along the first and second lines, besides the\r\nPortuguese militia and artillery (which manned the forts and redoubts\r\nand garrisoned Lisbon), a fine body of English marines which occupied\r\na line of embarkation, a powerful fleet in the Tagus, and a flotilla\r\nof gun-boats flanking the right of the British line. It was altogether\r\na stupendous line of defence, conceived by the military genius of the\r\nBritish commander, and executed by the military skill of the British\r\nengineer officers.”\r\n\r\nWellington continued to fall back until he reached “Busaco’s iron\r\nridge,” north of the Mondego. Here he determined to offer Masséna\r\nbattle, for three principal reasons. First, there was a growing\r\ndiscontent amongst the rank and file of his army by reason of lack\r\nof active warfare and the fall of Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida, and a\r\nvictory would put an end to this growing despondency. Second, also a\r\nmilitary consideration, the orders he had given for the laying waste of\r\nthe districts about Lisbon were not yet fully carried out. Third, from\r\na political point of view it was necessary because it would show that\r\nhe was not about to lock himself up within the lines of Torres Vedras\r\nbecause he was incapable or afraid of Napoleon’s legions. In a word, it\r\nwould “restore confidence,” a matter of first importance. It is quite\r\nincorrect to term Busaco a “useless battle” as some historians have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n“On the 25th and 26th,”[60] says M. de Rocca, “the French corps\r\narrived successively at the foot of the mountains Sierra de Busaco,\r\nwhose summits they found occupied by the Anglo-Portuguese army. At six\r\no’clock, on the morning of the 27th, they marched in column against the\r\nright and centre of that army, in the two roads leading to Coimbra, by\r\nthe village of San Antonio de Cantaro, and by the convent of Busaco.\r\nThese roads were cut up in several places, and defended by artillery.\r\nThe mountain over which they pass is besides encumbered with steep\r\nrocks, and is very difficult of access.\r\n\r\n“The French column which attacked the right of the English advanced\r\nwith intrepidity, in spite of the fire of their artillery and\r\nlight troops. It reached the top of the eminence after sustaining\r\nconsiderable loss, and began to deploy in line with the greatest\r\ncoolness, and most perfect regularity. But a superior force again\r\nassaulted it, and compelled it to retire. It soon rallied, made a\r\nsecond attack, and was again repulsed. The French battalions, which\r\nadvanced against the convent of Busaco, where the left and centre of\r\nthe English divisions joined, were also driven back, a little before\r\nthey reached that post. General Simon, who had been struck by two balls\r\nduring the charge, was left on the height, and a great many wounded\r\nofficers and soldiers.\r\n\r\n“The position occupied by the English and Portuguese on the brow of\r\nthe hill, formed the arc of a circle, whose two extremes embraced\r\nthe ground over which the French had to advance. The allied army saw\r\nthe least movements made below them, and had time to form to receive\r\nany powerful body before it arrived. This circumstance materially\r\ncontributed to the advantage they obtained....\r\n\r\n“Marshal Masséna judged that the position of Lord Wellington could\r\nnot be carried in front, and resolved to turn it. He kept up an\r\nirregular fire till the evening, and sent off a body of troops by the\r\nmountain-road, which leads from Mortago to Oporto. The English and\r\nPortuguese, in consequence of this movement, abandoned their position\r\non the mountain of Busaco.”\r\n\r\nThe attack on the British left was led by Ney, and it succeeded in\r\ndriving in the sharp-shooters. The French had practically reached the\r\nsummit, as Rocca states, when Craufurd’s division, concealed in a\r\nhollow, gave them the full benefit of their fire. “The enemy,” says Sir\r\nCharles Stewart, who fought on this memorable day, “unable to retreat,\r\nand afraid to resist, were rolled down the steep like a torrent of\r\nhailstones driven before a powerful wind; and not the bayonets only,\r\nbut the very hands of some of our brave fellows, became in an instant\r\nred with the blood of the fugitives. More brilliant or more decisive\r\ncharges than those executed this day by the two divisions which bore\r\nthe brunt of the action, were never perhaps witnessed; nor could\r\nanything equal the gallantry and intrepidity of our men throughout,\r\nexcept perhaps the hardihood which had ventured upon so desperate an\r\nattack.”\r\n\r\nReynier’s two divisions, 15,000 men in all, attacked Picton’s 3rd\r\ndivision on the right. The troops of Generals Hill and Leith, moving\r\nrapidly to Picton’s aid, decided their fate. “The right of the 3rd\r\ndivision had been, in the first instance, borne back,” says an\r\neye-witness, “the 8th Portuguese had suffered most severely; the enemy\r\nhad formed, in good order, upon the ground which they had so boldly\r\nwon, and were preparing to bear down to the right, and sweep our field\r\nof battle. Lord Wellington arrived on the spot at this moment, and\r\naided the gallant efforts of Picton’s regiments, the fire of whose\r\nmusketry was terrible, by causing two guns to play upon the French\r\nflank with grape. Unshaken even with this destruction, they still held\r\ntheir ground, till, with levelled bayonets and the shout of the charge,\r\nthe 45th and 88th regiments, British, most gallantly supported by the\r\n8th Portuguese, rushed forwards, and hurried them down the mountain\r\nside with a fearful slaughter.”\r\n\r\n“This movement,” writes Wellington, “has afforded me a favorable\r\nopportunity of showing the enemy the description of troops of which\r\nthis army is composed; it has brought the Portuguese levies into action\r\nwith the enemy for the first time in an advantageous situation; and\r\nthey have proved that the trouble which has been taken with them has\r\nnot been thrown away, and that they are worthy of contending in the\r\nsame ranks with British troops in this interesting cause, which they\r\nafford the best hopes of saving.\r\n\r\n“Throughout the contest on the Serra, and in all the previous marches,\r\nand those which we have since made, the whole army have conducted\r\nthemselves in the most regular manner. Accordingly all the operations\r\nhave been carried on with ease; the soldiers have suffered no\r\nprivations, have undergone no unnecessary fatigue, there has been no\r\nloss of stores, and the army is in the highest spirits.”\r\n\r\nThe total British and Portuguese losses, according to the official\r\nfigures, were 197 killed, 1014 wounded, and 58 missing. Masséna\r\nreported casualties to the number of 4486 men, including five\r\ngenerals. Anything but a kindly feeling existed between the French\r\nCommander-in-Chief and Ney previous to the battle; the result merely\r\ndeepened their unfriendliness, a pitiful contrast to the cordial\r\nrelations of Wellington and his colleagues.[61]\r\n\r\nIt is both delightful and pathetic to know that, after the last roll of\r\nthe guns had echoed through the valley, the British and the French put\r\naside their weapons and worked side by side in the humanitarian task of\r\nsearching for the wounded. It was the final scene of the tragedy, acted\r\nafter the curtain had fallen. It is recorded, as one of the incidents,\r\nthat a German officer serving with Napoleon’s colours, who had a\r\nbrother in the British 60th Regiment, asked a sworn enemy of an hour\r\nago if he knew what had happened to his relative? He answered his own\r\npathetic question by finding the soldier’s corpse.\r\n\r\n    _Books may tell of its story,\r\n    But only the heart can know\r\n    How war is robbed of its glory,\r\n    By the brave ones lying low,_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMasséna beats a Retreat\r\n\r\n(1810-11)\r\n\r\n  “_There will be a breeze near Lisbon, but I hope we shall have the\r\n  best of it._”\r\n\r\n            WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the failure of one of Wellington’s officers to occupy the\r\nBoialva Pass, Masséna was able to turn the British position, with the\r\nresult that his advanced guard appeared in front of Coimbra on the\r\nevening of the 30th September.\r\n\r\nWhen the Commander-in-Chief saw the French army defiling across the\r\nmountains “he seemed uneasy,” according to one who watched him, “his\r\ncountenance bore a fierce, angry expression, and, suddenly mounting his\r\nhorse, he rode away without speaking.”\r\n\r\nNo attempt was made to attack the enemy, Wellington considering it more\r\nprudent to leave the ridge, cross the Mondego, and retreat towards\r\nLisbon. This resolution was come to on the 28th September, and on the\r\n1st October the last man of the rear-guard had evacuated the town.\r\n“Although I could not save Coimbra,” Wellington writes, “I have very\r\nlittle doubt of being able to hold this country against the force which\r\nhas now attacked it.”\r\n\r\nThe place was immediately occupied by Masséna’s famished troops,\r\nwho found it not entirely destitute of eatables, as seemed only\r\ntoo probable judging by previous experience, although much of the\r\nfood had been destroyed by Wellington’s orders. They had merely to\r\nhelp themselves to what they could find, for most of the population\r\nhad followed in the wake of the allied army. “The inhabitants\r\nof the country have fled from their houses universally,” the\r\nCommander-in-Chief writes to the Earl of Liverpool from Alcobaço on\r\nthe 5th October, “carrying with them every thing they could take away\r\nwhich could be deemed useful to the enemy; and the habits of plunder\r\nwhich have been so long encouraged in the enemy’s army prevent them\r\nfrom deriving any general advantage from the little resource which the\r\ninhabitants may have been obliged to leave behind them.”\r\n\r\nIt is the straightforward utterance of a straightforward man.\r\nWellington seldom indulged in picturesque language; he had neither the\r\nnatural ability which commands a delicate choice of language nor the\r\ntime for vivid diction. His mind was cast in a sterner mould; he craved\r\nfor exactness, for cold, matter-of-fact calculations, for ungarnished\r\nessentials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Retreat from Coimbra\r\n\r\nThomas Maybank]\r\n\r\nFor graphic details we must turn to such an authority as Sir Charles\r\nStewart, who writes with the fluency of a gifted war-correspondent\r\npermitted to ride with the officers and obtain a view of everything\r\nof importance. “Crowds of men, women, and children,” he says,“--of\r\nthe sick, the aged, and the infirm, as well as of the robust and the\r\nyoung--covered the roads and the fields in every direction. Mothers\r\nmight be seen with infants at their breasts hurrying towards the\r\ncapital, and weeping as they went; old men, scarcely able to totter\r\nalong, made way chiefly by the aid of their sons and daughters; whilst\r\nthe whole wayside soon became strewed with bedding, blankets, and\r\nother species of household furniture, which the weary fugitives were\r\nunable to carry farther. During the retreat of Sir John Moore’s army\r\nnumerous heartrending scenes were brought before us; for then, as now,\r\nthe people, particularly in Galicia, fled at our approach; but\r\nthey all returned sooner or later to their homes, nor ever dreamed of\r\naccumulating upon our line of march, or following our fortunes. The\r\ncase was different here. Those who forsook their dwellings, forsook\r\nthem under the persuasion that they should never behold them again;\r\nand the agony which such an apprehension appeared to excite among the\r\nmajority exceeds any attempt at description.... It could not but occur\r\nto us that, though the devastating system must inevitably bear hard\r\nupon the French, the most serious evils would, in all probability,\r\narise out of it, both to ourselves and our allies, from the famine and\r\ngeneral distress which it threatened to bring upon a crowd so dense,\r\nshut up within the walls of a single city. At the moment there were\r\nfew amongst us who seemed not disposed to view it with reprobation;\r\nbecause, whilst they condemned its apparent violation of every feeling\r\nof humanity and justice, they doubted the soundness of the policy in\r\nwhich it originated.”\r\n\r\nLeaving a meagre force to guard the wounded and sick at Coimbra,\r\nMasséna started off in pursuit of the enemy as soon as the most\r\nprimeval of creature comforts had been satisfied. Six days after\r\nhis soldiers had left the place, namely, the 11th October 1810,\r\nWellington’s men entered the lines of Torres Vedras, but so rapid had\r\nbeen the French advance that they began to appear on the following\r\nmorning. La Romana had crossed from Estremadura with several thousand\r\nSpanish troops, thereby adding to Wellington’s forces, while Portuguese\r\nmilitia threatened the enemy’s communications.\r\n\r\nMasséna dared not attempt to retreat for fear of incurring Napoleon’s\r\ndispleasure. His only hope, as he repented at leisure, was that the\r\nsupplies of the defenders might fail, or that the Emperor, in response\r\nto urgent dispatches, would speedily send reinforcements both of men\r\nand of arms. The news that Coimbra, its garrison, and its invalids,\r\nhad fallen into the hands of militia under Colonel Trant merely added\r\ninsult to injury. As regards “starving out” the British and their\r\nallies, it was far more probable that their own food would run out, for\r\nwhile Wellington held the Tagus a constant supply of the necessaries\r\nof life was secured from incoming ships. Hunger did indeed eventually\r\ndrive Masséna from Santarem, a town some thirty miles from Wellington’s\r\nlines, on which he had been forced to fall back in November. The\r\nplace, perched on the summit of a height between the rivers Rio Mayor\r\nand Aviella, was admirably suited for defensive purposes, but after\r\nthe surrounding country had been stripped there was nothing to do but\r\nretire. The Marshal was fortunate in finding a district which the\r\nPortuguese had not laid bare. It sounds almost incredible, but it is\r\nrecorded that when Masséna succeeded in crossing the frontier his men\r\nwere so famished that one of them consumed no less than seventeen\r\npounds of native bread. The French General awaited with feverish\r\nanxiety the coming of Soult to his relief for nearly four months, but\r\nthat worthy was fighting battles and besieging Badajoz, which the\r\nSpaniards surrendered on the 10th March 1811, five days after his\r\ncolleague had been forced by sheer necessity to begin a retreat across\r\nthe mountains towards Ciudad Rodrigo.\r\n\r\nThe author of “The Journal of an Officer,” a reliable eye-witness, thus\r\ndescribes the town after Masséna had left it: “I have been for some\r\nweeks in view of Santarem, and saw at last with pleasure some symptoms\r\nof the French abandoning it. The first was setting fire to one of the\r\nprincipal convents in the upper town, and part of the lower town; the\r\nvolume of smoke was immense for three days. On the fourth morning some\r\ninformation to depend on reached us, and the bugle of attack roused us\r\nfrom our pillows. The haze of the morning clearing up, we could easily\r\nperceive the out sentinels were men of straw, and quite passive.[62] In\r\nfact, a better managed retreat was never executed. Not a vestige of a\r\ndollar’s worth remained. Being at the outposts with the 11th Dragoons\r\nand the 1st Royals, I entered with them, and three miserable deserters,\r\nwho had hid themselves with one too ill to move, were the only enemies\r\nto be found. Such a scene of horror, misery, and desolation, scarce\r\never saluted the eye of man. Smoking ruins, the accumulated filth of\r\nmonths, horses and human beings putrefied to suffocation, nearly caused\r\nto many a vomiting. The houses had scarcely a vestige of wood--doors,\r\nwindows, ceilings, roofs, burnt; and where the sick had expired,\r\nthere left to decay! The number thus left were great. Every church\r\ndemolished, the tombs opened for searching after hidden plate, every\r\naltar-piece universally destroyed, and the effluvia so offensive as to\r\ndefy describing.\r\n\r\n“In some gardens, the miserable heads, undecayed, stuck up like\r\nscarecrows; in some wells, a body floating.\r\n\r\n“Down a precipice to which we were invited by prospect to look, the\r\nhuman and animal carcases ... repulsed our senses, and shudderingly\r\nvibrated the soul at the savage, horrible, diabolical acts of a\r\nFrench army. Greater spirits, better discipline, and more order,\r\nnever attended an army than this. But to see the country, is to weep\r\nfor the horrors of war. Such horrid excess I never saw before. Every\r\ntown, village, or cottage destroyed. The growing nursery and the wild\r\ngrove, each havocked for destruction’s sake. The pot that refined\r\nthe oil broken, the wine-press burnt, for burning’s sake; the grape\r\nvines destroyed as noxious weeds; the furniture unburnt thrown from\r\nthe windows, and with carriages, etc., made a bonfire of; the large\r\nlibraries strewed over the land in remnants of paper; the noble convent\r\nin ashes, and the poor, unhappy, aged inhabitants, unable to flee, hung\r\naround as ornamenting the walls, ten or twelve in a place!”\r\n\r\nWellington, who had now received reinforcements, moved his headquarters\r\nto Santarem on the 6th March, anxious to overtake the enemy with the\r\nleast possible delay. He received the usual conflicting accounts of\r\nthe direction taken by them and their probable destination. Oporto was\r\nsuggested, which the Commander did not believe, “but they are in such a\r\nstate of distress, that it may be expected that they will try anything,\r\nhowever desperate. But I follow them closely; and they will find it\r\ndifficult to stop anywhere, for any purpose, till they shall draw near\r\nthe frontier.” He detached two divisions under Beresford, hoping that\r\nhe might be able to relieve Badajoz, and with five others continued to\r\nkeep “close at their heels,” to use his own expression. Unfortunately\r\nthe place fell before it was possible for Beresford to reach it. Had\r\nthe Governor held out, Wellington was of opinion that “the Peninsula\r\nwould have been safe,” and the relief of the south of Spain practically\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\n“Affairs” with the enemy were frequent during Wellington’s pursuit,\r\nbut by forcing them to evacuate the various positions they attempted\r\nto occupy, such as Pombal, Redinha, Cazal Nova and Foz d’Aronce,\r\nany designs they might have had against the northern provinces were\r\nprevented, notwithstanding the fact that the country afforded “many\r\nadvantageous positions to a retreating army, of which the enemy have\r\nshown that they know how to avail themselves.”\r\n\r\nIn writing to the Earl of Liverpool, Wellington remarks that “their\r\nconduct throughout this retreat has been marked by a barbarity seldom\r\nequalled, and never surpassed.” He tells a moving story of plunder,\r\nthe burning of houses, a convent, and a bishop’s palace. “This is the\r\nmode,” he adds in a burst of indignation, “in which the promises have\r\nbeen performed, and the assurances have been fulfilled, which were held\r\nout in the proclamation of the French Commander-in-Chief, in which he\r\ntold the inhabitants of Portugal that he was not come to make war upon\r\nthem, but with a powerful army of 110,000 men to drive the English into\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n“It is to be hoped that the example of what has occurred in this\r\ncountry will teach the people of this and of other nations what value\r\nthey ought to place on such promises and assurances; and that there\r\nis no security for life, or for anything which makes life valuable,\r\nexcepting in decided resistance to the enemy.”\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of the chase were many and oftentimes almost\r\nunsurmountable. Boats and bridge-building materials were scarce, and\r\ncaused delay in crossing rivers. Shoes wore out rapidly on account\r\nof the bad quality of the leather, and many of them were too small.\r\nEndless trouble was caused by the Spanish muleteers, who absolutely\r\nrefused to attend the Portuguese troops, some of whom Wellington was\r\nobliged to leave in the rear owing to the scarcity of provisions. For\r\ninstance, two brigades of infantry had to make nine days’ provisions,\r\nconsisting chiefly of bread and a little meat supplied by the British\r\ncommissariat, last for twenty-four days. “This is the assistance I\r\nreceive from the Portuguese Government!” the Commander-in-Chief writes,\r\nand one can imagine his grim face hardening as he pens the words. There\r\nwere the usual grievances against the rascally army contractors. The\r\nboots sent out were of bad quality, “in general too small.” We find him\r\nordering 150,000 pairs of boots and 100,000 pairs of soles and heels at\r\na time.\r\n\r\nThe most serious action during Masséna’s retreat was fought at Sabugal,\r\non the Coa, on the 3rd April. “We moved on the 2nd,” Wellington says\r\nwhen giving details of the engagement to Beresford, “and the British\r\narmy was formed opposite to them; the divisions of militia, under\r\nTrant and Wilson, were sent across the river at Cinco Villas, to alarm\r\nAlmeida for its communication. Yesterday morning”--he is writing on\r\nthe 4th inst.--“we moved the whole army (with the exception of the\r\n6th division, which remained at Rapoula de Coa, opposite Loison) to\r\nthe right, in order to turn this position, and force the passage of\r\nthe river. The 2nd corps could not have stood here for a moment; but\r\nunfortunately the Light division, which formed the right of the whole,\r\nnecessarily passed first, and the leading brigade, Beckwith’s, drove\r\nin the enemy’s piquets, which were followed briskly by four companies\r\nof the 95th, and three of Elder’s caçadores, and supported by the\r\n43rd regiment. At this time there came on a rain storm, and it was as\r\ndifficult to see as in the fogs on Busaco, and these troops pushed on\r\ntoo far, and became engaged with the main body of the enemy. The light\r\ninfantry fell back upon their support, which instead of halting, moved\r\nforward. The French then seeing how weak the body was which had passed,\r\nattempted to drive them down to the Coa, and did oblige the 43rd to\r\nturn. They rallied again, however, and beat in the French; but were\r\nattacked by fresh troops and cavalry, and were obliged to retire; but\r\nformed again, and beat back the enemy. At this time the 52nd joined the\r\n43rd, and both moved on upon the enemy, and to be charged and attacked\r\nagain in the same manner, and beat back. They formed again, moved\r\nforward upon the enemy, and established themselves on the top of the\r\nhill in an enclosure, and here they beat off the enemy.\r\n\r\n“But Reynier was placing a body of infantry on their left flank, which\r\nmust have destroyed them, only that at that moment the head of the 3rd\r\ndivision, which had passed the Coa on the left of the Light division,\r\ncame up, and opened their fire upon this column; and the 5th division,\r\nwhich passed this bridge and through this town [Sabugal], made their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n“The enemy then retired, having lost in this affair a howitzer, and I\r\nshould think not less than 1000 men.\r\n\r\n“Our loss is much less than one would have supposed possible, scarcely\r\n200 men. The 43rd have 73 killed and wounded. But really these attacks\r\nin columns[63] against our lines are very contemptible.\r\n\r\n“The contest was latterly entirely for the howitzer, which was taken\r\nand retaken twice, and at last remained in our hands. Our cavalry,\r\nwhich ought to have crossed the Coa on the right of the Light division,\r\ncrossed at the same ford, and therefore could be of no use to them.\r\nBesides they went too far to the right.\r\n\r\n“In short, these combinations for engagements do not answer, unless one\r\nis upon the spot to direct every trifling movement. I was upon a hill\r\non the left of the Coa, immediately above the town, till the 3rd and\r\n5th divisions crossed, whence I could see every movement on both sides,\r\nand could communicate with ease with everybody; but that was not near\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n“We took 6 Officers, and between 200 and 300 prisoners, and Soult’s[64]\r\nand Loison’s baggage.”\r\n\r\nTwo days after this affair on the banks of the Coa Masséna crossed the\r\nfrontier, having been literally driven out of Portugal. Within a few\r\nhours we find Wellington urging on Beresford the necessity for a strict\r\nblockade of Badajoz preparatory to besieging it. Masséna fell back\r\nupon Salamanca, while Wellington busied himself with the investment of\r\nAlmeida, where a French garrison had been left. With Ciudad Rodrigo,\r\nthe second and remaining place occupied by the Marshal’s troops, he\r\nfelt he could do little at the moment beyond intercepting supplies.\r\nThese two forts, which are within comparatively easy distance and\r\nalmost parallel, the one in Portugal and the other in Spain, were\r\nextremely important, and commanded the north-eastern frontier of the\r\nformer country.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the British Commander-in-Chief also took the opportunity\r\nto publish a lengthy Proclamation to the Portuguese nation, of which\r\nthe following is a brief synopsis. He informs the inhabitants that they\r\nare now “at liberty to return to their occupations,” that nearly four\r\nyears have elapsed since “the tyrant of Europe” invaded the country,\r\nthe object being “the insatiable desire of plunder, the wish to\r\ndisturb the tranquillity, and to enjoy the riches of a people who had\r\npassed nearly half a century in peace.” He then strikes a deeper note\r\nand adds a few words of advice as to the future:\r\n\r\n“The Marshal General, however, considers it his duty, in announcing the\r\nintelligence of the result of the last invasion, to warn the people\r\nof Portugal, that, although the danger is removed, it is not entirely\r\ngone by. They have something to lose, and the tyrant will endeavor to\r\nplunder them: they are happy under the mild government of a beneficent\r\nSovereign; and he will endeavor to destroy their happiness: they have\r\nsuccessfully resisted him, and he will endeavor to force them to submit\r\nto his iron yoke. They should be unremitting in their preparations for\r\ndecided and steady resistance; those capable of bearing arms should\r\nlearn the use of them; or those whose age or sex renders them unfit\r\nto bear arms should fix upon places of security and concealment, and\r\nshould make all the arrangements for their easy removal to them when\r\nthe moment of danger shall approach. Valuable property, which tempts\r\nthe avarice of the tyrant and his followers, and is the great object of\r\ntheir invasion, should be carefully buried beforehand, each individual\r\nconcealing his own, and thus not trusting to the weakness of others to\r\nkeep a secret in which they may not be interested.\r\n\r\n“Measures should be taken to conceal or destroy provisions which cannot\r\nbe removed, and everything which can tend to facilitate the enemy’s\r\nprogress; for this may be depended upon, that the enemy’s troops seize\r\nupon everything, and leave nothing for the owner.\r\n\r\n“By these measures, whatever may be the superiority of numbers with\r\nwhich the desire of plunder and of revenge may induce, and his power\r\nmay enable, the tyrant again to invade this country, the result will be\r\ncertain; and the independence of Portugal, and the happiness of its\r\ninhabitants, will be finally established to their eternal honor.”[65]\r\n\r\nHowever “beneficent” the Sovereign--who was a lunatic and out of the\r\ncountry--might be, Wellington had little that was good to say of its\r\npresent rulers. He told them that he would inform the home Cabinet\r\n“that they cannot with propriety continue to risk a British army in\r\nthis country unsupported by any exertion of any description on the part\r\nof the Portuguese Government.” The army was lamentably deficient “in\r\nthat essential arm, its cavalry,” and the commissariat arrangements\r\nremained hopelessly deficient.\r\n\r\nThe blockade of Almeida being “a simple operation, which I do not think\r\nthe enemy have the means or inclination to interrupt,” Wellington left\r\nit in the hands of Lieut.-General Sir Brent Spencer in the middle of\r\nApril, and set out from Villa Fermosa for Alemtejo to discuss his\r\nfuture projects with Castaños and also to visit Beresford. He knew that\r\nthe French at Almeida would be forced to withdraw or surrender owing\r\nto the scarcity of provisions, but at Ciudad Rodrigo “there is a good\r\ngarrison, and we certainly shall not get that place without a siege;\r\nfor which God knows if we shall have time before the enemy will be\r\nreinforced. The first object is certainly Badajoz, and, as soon as I\r\nknow whether any or what part of our train is required for the attack\r\nof that place, I shall send the remainder to Oporto, and make all the\r\narrangements for the eventual attack of Ciudad Rodrigo.”\r\n\r\nAs Soult was then busily occupied in fortifying Seville, to the south\r\nof Badajoz, the siege of the latter city became imperative, and without\r\nunnecessary delay. Soult might attempt to relieve Badajoz; certainly\r\nhis presence at Seville precluded the likelihood of the garrison being\r\ndeceived by any feint or actual attack made on that place by the allies\r\nwith the object of distracting their attention.\r\n\r\nAlthough Wellington did not meet Castaños personally during his visit\r\nto the south, he sent him a plan of operations, to be undertaken with\r\nBlake and Ballasteros in co-operation with Beresford, and got through\r\nan immense amount of work in connection with the siege. “The continued\r\nand increasing inefficiency of the Portuguese regiments with this\r\narmy,” gave him much cause for concern. On the 30th April 1811, four\r\ndays after Parliament had thanked him for the liberation of Portugal,\r\nhe tells Beresford that “if some effectual steps are not taken, the\r\nPortuguese force with this part of the army (_i.e._ Wellington’s) will\r\nbe annihilated.” He concludes by saying that he must report the matter\r\nto the home authorities, which he did. “The Ministers and the English\r\npublic believe that we have 30,000 men for whom we pay, and half as\r\nmany more supported by the Portuguese Government. I do not believe that\r\nI have here 11,000, or that you have 5000, and of the number many are\r\nnot fit for service.”\r\n\r\nMasséna was not the type of man who easily acknowledges defeat. He\r\nhad been busily engaged at Salamanca in getting what remained of his\r\narmy into working order. He had lost at least 25,000 of the 70,000 men\r\nwho had entered Portugal, but when he decided to go to the assistance\r\nof Almeida he could with difficulty muster only 39,000, some 5000\r\nmore than Wellington could put into the field. Having relieved Ciudad\r\nRodrigo, Masséna crossed the Agueda, with the fixed intention of\r\nraising the blockade of Almeida. On the 3rd May he was in sight of the\r\nBritish army, now arrayed at Fuentes de Oñoro.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief had returned from his travels on the 28th of the\r\nprevious month, after having been informed by Spencer of the gathering\r\nof the enemy. “I’ll venture to say,” remarks Kincaid, “that there was\r\nnot a heart in the army that did not beat more lightly when we heard\r\nthe joyful news of his arrival the day before the enemy’s advance.” On\r\nthe 3rd May the British were “warmly but partially engaged,” and “made\r\nno progress in raising the blockade.”\r\n\r\nThe real battle began on the 5th, and was, in Alison’s opinion, “the\r\nmost critical in which Lord Wellington was engaged in the whole war,\r\nand in which the chances of irreparable defeat were most against the\r\nBritish army.” He then gives some of Sir Charles Stewart’s reflections\r\non the fight, which help us to appreciate its difficulties from the\r\npoint of view of an actual eye-witness who took a leading part in the\r\nbattle. “Masséna’s superiority to us,” he notes, “both in cavalry\r\nand artillery, was very great; whilst the thick woods in our front\r\nafforded the most convenient plateau which he could have desired for\r\nthe distribution of his columns unseen, and therefore disregarded. Had\r\nhe rightly availed himself of this advantage, he might have poured the\r\nmass of his force upon any single point, and perhaps made an impression\r\nbefore we could have had time to support it. Had he commenced his\r\nattack with a violent cannonade, it must have produced some havoc,\r\nand probably considerable confusion, in our line. He might then have\r\nmoved forward his cavalry _en masse_, supporting it by strong columns\r\nof infantry; and had either the one or the other succeeded in piercing\r\nthrough, our situation would have been by no means an enviable one....\r\nHad he thrown his cavalry round our right flank--a movement which\r\nwe should have found it no easy matter to prevent--crossed the Coa,\r\nadvanced upon our lines of communication, and stopped our supplies,\r\nat the moment when, with his infantry, he threatened to turn us; then\r\npushed upon Sabugal and the places near, he might have compelled us\r\nto pass the Coa with all our artillery at the most disadvantageous\r\nplaces, and cut us off from our best and safest retreat. There was,\r\nindeed, a time during the affair of the 5th, when his design of acting\r\nin this manner was seriously apprehended; and Lord Wellington was in\r\nconsequence reduced to the necessity of deciding whether he should\r\nrelinquish the Sabugal road or raise the blockade of Almeida. But\r\nLord Wellington’s presence of mind never for a moment forsook him. He\r\nfelt no distrust in his troops; to retain his hold over a secure and\r\naccessible line of retreat was therefore to him a consideration of less\r\nmoment than to continue an operation of which the ultimate success\r\ncould now be neither doubtful nor remote; and he at once determined to\r\nexpose Sabugal rather than throw open a communication with Almeida. It\r\nwas a bold measure, but it was not adopted without due consideration,\r\nand it received an ample reward in the successful termination of this\r\nhard-fought battle.”\r\n\r\nWellington’s line was extended on a table-land between the rivers\r\nTurones and Dos Casas. It reached several miles, namely, from Fort\r\nConception, which covered Almeida (opposite the village of that name\r\nhe disposed his centre), to beyond Nava d’Aver, his right being at\r\nFuentes de Oñoro. Poço Velho, between the latter place and Nava d’Aver,\r\nwas also occupied by the left wing of the 7th Division, commanded by\r\nGeneral Houstoun.\r\n\r\nMasséna’s first movement was to attack the Spanish irregulars, under\r\nDon Julian Sanchez, stationed on the hill of Nava d’Aver, which was\r\nneither a lengthy nor a difficult process.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Houstoun scarcely fared better, two of his battalions\r\nbeing routed. The immediate consequence was that Captain Norman\r\nRamsay’s battery of Horse Artillery, which were supporting Houstoun,\r\nwere soon fighting against fearful odds. By means of a magnificent\r\ncharge, while the attention of part of the French force was detracted\r\nby the dragoons under Sir Stapleton Cotton, Ramsay made good his escape\r\nwith every gun.\r\n\r\nThe situation was extremely critical when the squares of the 7th and\r\nLight Divisions were attacked by the enemy’s cavalry, but Wellington\r\ndid not hesitate for a moment as to the best course to pursue. He\r\nabandoned Nava d’Aver and closed in his line by a complete change\r\nof front, withdrawing some of his divisions to the heights, and\r\nHoustoun’s men behind the Turones, to a position near Freneda, which\r\nbecame the British right and Fuentes de Oñoro the left.\r\n\r\n“Montbrun’s cavalry,” we are told, “merely hovered about Craufurd’s\r\nsquares, the plain was soon cleared, the cavalry took post behind the\r\ncentre, and the Light Division formed a reserve to the right of the 1st\r\nDivision, sending the riflemen among the rocks to connect it with the\r\n7th Division, which had arrived at Freneda, and was there joined by\r\nJulian Sanchez. At the sight of this new front, so deeply lined with\r\ntroops, the French stopped short, and commenced a heavy cannonade,\r\nwhich did great execution, from the closeness of the allied masses;\r\nbut twelve British guns replied with vigour, and the violence of the\r\nenemy’s fire abated; their cavalry then drew out of range, and a body\r\nof French infantry, attempting to glide down the ravine of the Turones,\r\nwas repulsed by the riflemen and light companies of the Guards.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a fierce conflict was taking place in the village of Fuentes.\r\nIt continued see-saw fashion until the evening, both sides bringing\r\nup reserves and contesting every inch of the ground. Three regiments\r\nwere driven from the lower parts of the village, but reinforcements\r\nwere at hand, and the higher streets were never abandoned, although a\r\nchapel held by the troops in that quarter was evacuated. At nightfall\r\nthe French crossed the river, leaving 400 of their dead in the village.\r\nWellington averred that the battle “was the most difficult I was ever\r\nconcerned in, and against the greatest odds. We had very nearly three\r\nto one against us engaged; about four to one of cavalry; and, moreover,\r\nour cavalry had not a gallop in them, while some of that of the enemy\r\nwas fresh, and in excellent order. If Bony had been there we should\r\nhave been beaten.”\r\n\r\nAs a battle the engagement scarcely could be called a victory for the\r\nAllies, but Masséna had failed to relieve Almeida, while Wellington\r\nhad succeeded in covering its blockade. The total casualties of the\r\nBritish, Spanish, and Portuguese on the 3rd and 5th reached 1800, of\r\nthe French nearly 3000, and 210 were taken prisoners. On the morning\r\nof the 8th May the last of the enemy left the field, but three days\r\nlater the Commander-in-Chief received bad news. On the previous night\r\nthe garrison of Almeida blew up part of the fortress and escaped,\r\nalthough the force sent by Wellington to blockade it was “four times\r\nmore numerous than the garrison.” He characterized it as “the most\r\ndisgraceful event that has yet occurred to us.” His correspondence at\r\nthis period teems with references to it.\r\n\r\nMasséna was no longer “the favoured child of victory” or Napoleon’s\r\n“right arm,” as the Emperor had called him, and he was recalled, to be\r\nsucceeded by Marmont, an excellent artillery officer then not quite\r\nthirty-seven years of age, whereas Masséna was fifty-three and deemed\r\n“too old” by his autocratic sovereign.\r\n\r\nMarmont speedily came to the conclusion when he took up his new\r\npost that without rest the so-called army of Portugal could not\r\npossibly expect to meet Wellington with any likelihood of success.\r\nHe accordingly moved his troops to the province of Salamanca, where\r\nwe will leave them for a little while to watch the course of the war\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nBeresford had now invested Badajoz, and engaged the enemy in several\r\nsorties, on one occasion suffering severe loss owing to the imprudence\r\nof his troops. Receiving news to the effect that Soult was rapidly\r\napproaching with the determined object of relieving it, he raised the\r\nsiege and posted his army on the ridge of Albuera to stop the French\r\nadvance. The British Commander had nearly 32,000 men at his disposal.\r\nOf these no fewer than 24,000 were foreigners, including the Spanish\r\nforces of Blake, Castaños, Ballasteros, and Don Carlos d’España, which\r\nhad formed a junction with him. The enemy had 23,000 troops.\r\n\r\nAs Wellington was not present a detailed description of the battle,\r\nwhich took place on the 16th May, does not come within the province\r\nof this volume. It was one of the most fiercely contested of the\r\nentire war. So much so that Beresford used up his entire reserves and\r\nlost 4100 British troops, in addition to 1400 Portuguese and Spanish\r\nkilled and wounded. The French losses were over 6000, and 500 were\r\ntaken prisoners. Had it not been for Colonel Hardinge, Beresford would\r\nhave retreated. Following his colleague’s advice he remained and was\r\nvictorious. It was at Albuera that the 57th Foot (now the 1st Middlesex\r\nRegiment) won the well-deserved name of “Die Hards” from the fact that\r\nColonel Inglis shouted to his troops, “Die hard, my men; die hard!”[66]\r\n“It was observed,” writes Beresford to Wellington, “that our dead,\r\nparticularly the 57th regiment, were lying, as they had fought, in\r\nranks, and that every wound was in front.”\r\n\r\nOn the 19th Wellington, with two divisions, arrived at Elvas, and on\r\nthe 21st he rode to Albuera and surveyed the site of the contest. “The\r\nfighting was desperate,” he writes, “and the loss of the British has\r\nbeen very severe; but, adverting to the nature of the contest, and the\r\nmanner in which they held their ground against all the efforts the\r\nwhole French army could make against them, notwithstanding all the\r\nlosses which they had sustained, I think this action one of the most\r\nglorious and honourable to the character of the troops of any that has\r\nbeen fought during the war.”\r\n\r\nSurely a more noble tribute to the “common” soldier was never penned!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nThe Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo\r\n\r\n(1811-12)\r\n\r\n  “_The great object in all sieges is to gain time._”\r\n\r\n            WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exacting nature of the campaign was beginning to tell on\r\nWellington. “I certainly feel, every day,” he had written to the Earl\r\nof Liverpool on the 15th May 1811, “more and more the difficulty of\r\nthe situation in which I am placed. I am obliged to go everywhere, and\r\nif absent from any operation, something goes wrong.” “Another such\r\nbattle” as Albuera, he informs his brother Henry on the 22nd, “would\r\nruin us,” and he proceeds to compare the Spanish and Portuguese troops,\r\nto the disadvantage of the former. They often held their ground too\r\nwell, there was no moving them in a battle. On the other hand, “We do\r\nwhat we please now with the Portuguese troops; we manœuvre them under\r\nfire equally with our own, and have some dependence on them; but these\r\nSpaniards can do nothing, but stand still, and we consider ourselves\r\nfortunate if they do not run away.” In his report of the battle\r\nBeresford mentions the Spanish cavalry as having behaved “extremely\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\nSome idea of the enormous amount of labour involved may be gained from\r\nthe fact that on the day mentioned Wellington either wrote or dictated\r\nat least eighteen dispatches, including two dealing with the loss of\r\nan officer for whose widow and child he was endeavouring to obtain\r\n“favour and protection” at the hands of the home authorities. At the\r\nsame time he was actively preparing for the renewed siege of Badajoz:\r\n“The late action has made a terrible hole in our ranks; but I am\r\nworking hard to set all to rights again.” He appeared “destined to pass\r\nhis life in the harness,” to use his own phrase, and had “a monstrous\r\nquantity of business to settle of different descriptions.”\r\n\r\nReferring to the difference of opinion held by his officers regarding\r\nhis policy, he says, “I believe nothing but something worse than\r\nfirmness could have carried me through.... To this add that people in\r\nEngland were changing their opinions almost with the wind, and you will\r\nsee that I had not much to look to excepting myself.” The words are\r\nalmost those of a broken-hearted man.\r\n\r\nBadajoz was again invested on the 25th May, and the batteries opened\r\nfire on the 3rd of the following month in an attempt to breach the\r\nfort of San Christoval and the castle. Wellington had then made his\r\nheadquarters at Quinta de Granicha, from whence he writes, on the 6th\r\nto the Earl of Liverpool, to the effect that if he cannot prevent the\r\nenemy from receiving provisions he will not risk an action because he\r\nhas not the means, and out of fairness to his soldiers he cannot “make\r\nthem endure the labours of another siege at this advanced season.\r\nNotwithstanding that we have carried on our operations with such\r\ncelerity,” he concludes “we have had great difficulties to contend\r\nwith, and have been much delayed by the use of the old ordnance and\r\nequipments of Elvas, and of the Portuguese artillery, in this siege;\r\nsome of the guns from which we fire are above 150 years old.” The\r\nmajority of them were supposed to be 24-pounders, but they proved to\r\nbe larger, with the result that their fire was very uncertain. Two\r\nattempts were made to storm the outwork of San Christoval without\r\nsuccess, many brave fellows perishing in the vain effort to escalade\r\nthe walls.\r\n\r\nThree weeks had not elapsed before it became eminently necessary to\r\nretire from this scene of activity. During this short time nearly 500\r\nofficers and men had been reported as killed, wounded, or missing,\r\nand fifty-two of the Chasseurs Britanniques had deserted. “I have a\r\ngreat objection to foreigners in this army,” he informs a colleague\r\na little later, “as they desert terribly; and they not only give the\r\nenemy intelligence which he would find it difficult to get in any\r\nother manner, but by their accounts and stories of the mode in which\r\ndeserters from the French army are treated by us, some of them well\r\nfounded, they have almost put an end to desertion.” The reason for the\r\nlatter belief was the legend “that the deserters from the enemy are\r\nsent to the West India Islands, and have no chance of ever returning to\r\nEurope.”\r\n\r\nMarmont, having united his scattered units, was about to join\r\nforces with Soult, which meant that when they marched on Badajoz,\r\nas undoubtedly they would do, the French army might number between\r\n50,000 and 60,000 troops. Wellington had been of opinion that it was\r\npossible to reduce the place before the end of the second week of\r\nJune. An intercepted dispatch from Soult to Marmont made it abundantly\r\nevident that the enemy were to concentrate in Estremadura, and other\r\nintelligence clearly proved that the destination of the French army\r\nwas “to the southward.” Elvas, where supplies were running low, had\r\nfirst to be replenished, so that it might be in a condition of defence\r\nshould the enemy cross the frontiers. Leaving a comparatively small\r\nnumber of men to blockade Badajoz, and having made arrangements for\r\nthe strengthening of Elvas, he marched from that place to Quinta de\r\nSt João, where he remained for a considerable period. For nearly a\r\nfortnight the French threatened to attack, and had they done so it\r\nis scarcely possible that Wellington could have held his own in the\r\nfield. Soult was the first to withdraw, the immediate cause being the\r\nthreatening of Seville by Blake, who retired when Soult approached.\r\nMarmont, feeling unequal to fight alone, marched to the valley of the\r\nTagus and cantoned his army between Talavera and Plasencia. During the\r\ncrisis the two marshals mustered 62,000 troops, Wellington about 48,000.\r\n\r\nThe heat and other considerations prevented Wellington from besieging\r\nBadajoz; to relieve Cadiz was out of the question because the forces\r\nof Soult and Marmont would be almost certain to come to the assistance\r\nof the force before the great southern port. He therefore decided to\r\nbesiege Ciudad Rodrigo, for four reasons stated in a letter to the\r\nEarl of Liverpool dated the 18th July, namely: “We can derive some\r\nassistance from our militia in the north in carrying it into execution,\r\nand the climate in which the operation is to be carried on is not\r\nunfavorable at this season. If it should not succeed, the attempt will\r\nremove the war to the strongest frontier of Portugal; and, if obliged\r\nto resume the defensive, the strength of our army will be centrically\r\nsituated, while the enemy’s armies of the north and of the south will\r\nbe disunited.” Shortly after the above dispatch was written he heard\r\nthat Suchet had captured Tarragona, which made the proposed operation\r\n“less favorable.” “However,” he tells Beresford on the 20th of the\r\nsame month, “we shall have a very fine army of little less than 60,000\r\nmen,[67] including artillery, in the course of about a fortnight; and\r\nI do not see what I can do with it, to improve the situation of the\r\nallies, during the period in which it is probable that, the enemy’s\r\nattention being taken up with the affairs of the north of Europe,[68]\r\nwe shall be more nearly on a par of strength with him, excepting we\r\nundertake this operation.”\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General Hill was entrusted with the duty of watching the\r\nenemy in Alemtejo,[69] and two divisions were left in Estremadura.\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief, with some 40,000 men, hastened towards Ciudad\r\nRodrigo, unaware at the moment that the garrison had been reinforced\r\nand that Napoleon was sending more men to the Peninsula. When these\r\nimportant facts reached him he contented himself with blockading the\r\nplace, and prepared to retire behind the Agueda should necessity\r\nwarrant. Marmont sent for Dorsenne, who had taken the command in\r\nGalicia from Bessières, and with 60,000 troops set out toward the end\r\nof September to relieve Ciudad Rodrigo. Wellington then occupied El\r\nBodon, on the left bank of the Agueda. “The object of taking a position\r\nso near to the enemy,” he says, “was to force them to show their army.\r\nThis was an object, because the people of the country, as usual,\r\nbelieved and reported that the enemy were not so strong as we knew them\r\nto be; and if they had not seen the enemy’s strength, they would have\r\nentertained a very unfavorable opinion of the British army, which it\r\nwas desirable to avoid. This object was accomplished by the operations\r\nat the close of September.”\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 25th the Marshal drove in the outposts of\r\nWellington’s left wing, and turned the heights occupied by the right\r\ncentre, thereby placing the British Commander in a dangerous position,\r\nfrom which he extricated himself by hurling his cavalry at the horsemen\r\nand artillery now endeavouring to scale the heights. Two British guns\r\nwere captured and retaken at the point of the bayonet. When the French\r\ninfantry were brought into action Wellington gradually withdrew in the\r\ndirection of Fuente Guinaldo, pursued by the enemy’s cavalry, which\r\nwere received by solid British squares and repelled as six miles were\r\ntraversed. Marmont again advanced on the 26th, but did not attack.\r\nWellington retreated until he reached a strong position in front of\r\nSabugal on the 28th.\r\n\r\nA rear-guard action had been fought on the previous day at Aldea\r\nda Ponte, but Marmont withdrew without offering battle, and, after\r\nsupplying much needed necessaries to Ciudad Rodrigo, proceeded to the\r\nTagus valley and Dorsenne to Salamanca. Wellington renewed the blockade\r\n“in order,” as he says, “to keep a large force of the enemy employed\r\nto observe our operations, and to prevent them from undertaking any\r\noperation elsewhere.” Placing his army in cantonments on the banks of\r\nthe Coa, the Commander-in-Chief made his headquarters at Freneda.\r\n\r\nWhile in their winter quarters both officers and men were able to\r\nrecuperate after their previous arduous campaign. Sports, theatricals\r\nand other amusements helped to pass away the time and to cheer up the\r\narmy. Even more important was the opportunity thus afforded the many\r\nsemi-invalids to recover their health. “We are really almost an army\r\nof convalescents.” Wellington himself rode to hounds occasionally, and\r\napplauded the amateur histrionic efforts of his soldiers, when time\r\nand circumstances permitted him to attend their performances. He was\r\nable to re-establish Almeida as a military post, where he kept his\r\nbattering-train to deceive the enemy, to blockade Ciudad Rodrigo, and\r\nto prepare for its investment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the guerillas were “increasing in numbers and boldness\r\nthroughout the Peninsula,” constantly annoying the French commanders.\r\n“It was their indomitable spirit of resistance,” says Professor\r\nOman,[70] “which enabled Wellington, with his small Anglo-Portuguese\r\narmy, to keep the field against such largely superior numbers. No\r\nsooner had the French concentrated, and abandoned a district, than\r\nthere sprang up in it a local Junta and a ragged apology for an army.\r\nEven where the invaders lay thickest, along the route from Bayonne to\r\nMadrid, guerilla bands maintained themselves in the mountains, cut off\r\ncouriers and escorts, and often isolated one French army from another\r\nfor weeks at a time. The greater partisan chiefs, such as Mina in\r\nNavarre, Julian Sanchez in Leon, and Porlier in the Cantabrian hills,\r\nkept whole brigades of the French in constant employment. Often beaten,\r\nthey were never destroyed, and always reappeared to strike some daring\r\nblow at the point where they were least expected. Half the French army\r\nwas always employed in the fruitless task of guerilla-hunting. This was\r\nthe secret which explains the fact that, with 300,000 men under arms,\r\nthe invaders could never concentrate more than 70,000 to deal with\r\nWellington.”\r\n\r\nIn the autumn and winter of 1811 the enemy accomplished nothing of\r\nimportance in eastern and southern Spain. In the south-east Suchet\r\ndefeated Blake on the 25th October at the battle of Sagunto, “the last\r\npitched battle of the war,” remarks the above authority, “in which a\r\nSpanish army, unaided by British troops, attempted to face the French.”\r\nForced into the city of Valencia with part of his motley array, Blake\r\nmade a gallant attempt to rid himself of his besieger, an almost\r\nimpossible task considering that Suchet had been reinforced while the\r\nunfortunate Spanish commander had been considerably reduced. On the 9th\r\nJanuary 1812 his 16,000 followers laid down their weapons.\r\n\r\nThe investment of Ciudad Rodrigo by Wellington had been delayed owing\r\nto a complexity of causes. All the carting had to be performed by\r\nPortuguese and Spanish, and their slowness and the inclement weather\r\ncombined precluded the Commander-in-Chief from pushing forward his\r\noperations with any celerity of movement. Empty carts took two days to\r\ngo ten miles on a good road. Wellington confessed that he had to appear\r\nsatisfied, otherwise the drivers would have deserted. If he succeeded\r\nin his designs he hoped to “make a fine campaign in the spring”; if he\r\ndid not, “I shall bring back towards this frontier the whole [French]\r\narmy which had marched towards Valencia and Aragon. By these means I\r\nhope to save Valencia.”\r\n\r\nAlas, for human ambition! The capital of the province fell three days\r\nafter the above dispatch was written.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th January 1812 a start was made, and Ciudad Rodrigo invested.\r\nDuring the night the palisaded redoubt on the hill of San Francisco,\r\nwhich the French had recently constructed, was stormed and carried,\r\nbut Wellington at once perceived that the enemy had made good use\r\nof their time by strengthening their works and fortifying three\r\nconvents in the suburbs. “The success of this operation,” he writes,\r\n“enabled us immediately to break ground within 600 yards of the place,\r\nnotwithstanding that the enemy still hold the fortified convents; and\r\nthe enemy’s work has been turned into a part of our first parallel,\r\nand a good communication made with it.” Wellington encamped his men on\r\nthe southern bank, which necessitated their fording the narrow stream,\r\nalthough he had built a bridge lower down the Agueda for munitions.\r\nIt was no child’s play for the soldiers. Through icy cold water,\r\nacross ground covered with snow and frost, and amidst a rain of shot\r\nand shell, these brave fellows went to their work, each division in\r\nsuccession. Some of them returned, others did not, for “The path of\r\nglory leads but to the grave.”\r\n\r\nThe convent of Santa Cruz was captured on the night of the 13th,\r\nfollowed on the 14th by the fall of the convent of San Francisco and\r\nother fortified posts in the suburbs. By this time batteries were\r\nwithin 180 yards of the walls. “We proceeded at Ciudad Rodrigo,” he\r\ntells the Duke of Richmond, “on quite a new principle in sieges. The\r\nwhole object of our fire was to lay open the walls. We had not one\r\nmortar; nor a howitzer, excepting to prevent the enemy from clearing\r\nthe breaches, and for that purpose we had only two; and we fired upon\r\nthe flanks and defences only when we wished to get the better of them,\r\nwith a view to protect those who were to storm. This shows the kind of\r\nplace we had to attack....” Matters now became urgent, for advice had\r\nbeen received that Marmont was stirring. By the 19th the breaches made\r\nin the ramparts by the artillery were declared practicable. Wellington\r\nhad already summoned the Governor to surrender. His reply was that “he\r\nand the brave garrison which he commanded were prepared rather to bury\r\nthemselves in the ruins of a place entrusted to them by their Emperor.”\r\nThe troops, consisting of the regiments of the 3rd and Light Divisions\r\nand some Portuguese caçadores, marched to the assault in five columns.\r\n“Rangers of Connaught,” cried General Picton to the “Fighting 3rd,” who\r\nwere charged with the centre attack, “it is not my intention to expend\r\nany powder this evening; we’ll do this business with the cold iron.”\r\n\r\nIt was the task of Picton and his men to assault the great breach,\r\nwhile the 52nd, the 43rd, and the 95th regiments, assisted by two\r\nbattalions of caçadores, assaulted the other. At the same time a\r\nbrigade of Portuguese under General Pack was to make a feint at the\r\nSantiago gate, at the southern end of the town, and the light company\r\nof the 83rd regiment with another body of native soldiers were to scale\r\nthe castle walls. As the columns advanced the moon, then in its first\r\nquarter, revealed their black outline to the enemy. They at once opened\r\nfire. No reply was vouchsafed by the Allies, who marched with fixed\r\nbayonets and unloaded muskets. It was not part of their plan to return\r\na greeting made by men who were behind ramparts.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese under Colonel O’Toole were the first to attack, closely\r\nfollowed by the 5th, 94th, and 77th regiments, the last supposed to act\r\nas a reserve. The Light Division, impatient of delay and not wishing to\r\nbe rivalled in prowess, hurled themselves at the small breach without\r\nwaiting for the bags of hay which were to be thrown in the ditch to\r\nassist them in crossing. Many of the attacking force literally passed\r\nover the shot-riddled bodies of the vanguard as they attempted to\r\nget through. Major George Napier, while leading his men, had his arm\r\nshattered, but still continued to encourage them; Robert Craufurd,\r\nthe intrepid and cantankerous commander of the Light Division, fell\r\nmortally wounded; Major-General Mackinnon was blown up by the explosion\r\nof a magazine. Nine officers and eleven non-commissioned officers and\r\ndrummers gave up their lives for their country during the siege and\r\nin the assault from the 8th to the 19th, the total loss in killed and\r\ninjured being nearly 1000. The hand-to-hand fighting continued in the\r\nstreets, and the town caught fire.\r\n\r\nAt dawn 1700 of the enemy surrendered, including the Governor.\r\nMarmont’s battering train, scores of field guns, and a plentiful supply\r\nof ammunition fell into the hands of the victors. Wellington had\r\n“great pleasure” in reporting “the uniform good conduct, and spirit of\r\nenterprise, and patience, and perseverance in the performance of great\r\nlabor” on the part of the troops who had been engaged. As for the men\r\nthemselves, they got drunk and sacked the place.\r\n\r\nWellington’s rewards for the capture of Ciudad Rodrigo were numerous.\r\nHe became an Earl in Great Britain, a Duke in Spain, and a Marquis in\r\nPortugal. In addition he was granted an extra annual pension of £2000\r\nby Parliament. Financial offers were also forthcoming from the two\r\nPeninsula Powers, but he declined them. “He had only done his duty to\r\nhis country, and to his country alone he would look for his reward.”\r\n\r\nMarmont was in ignorance of the siege until the 15th January. He\r\nthen began to make preparations, but when he was ready the fortress\r\nhad fallen, and he moved his army to Valladolid, to the north-east.\r\nNapoleon then sent orders to the Marshal that if he could not regain\r\nCiudad Rodrigo he was to return to Salamanca, cross the frontier, and\r\nadvance on Almeida. He foresaw that perhaps Wellington might turn his\r\nattention to Badajoz, which, in the Emperor’s opinion, would be a\r\n“mistake,” and that of necessity he would have to return to succour\r\nthe Portuguese fortress: “You will soon bring him back again.” The\r\nBritish Commander also surmised that another attack on Ciudad was quite\r\npossible. Before setting out on his next bold enterprise he therefore\r\nput the fortifications in thorough repair, and brought up a reserve\r\nsupply of 50,000 rations in case it should be besieged. Satisfied that\r\nthe place could now offer a bold resistance to the enemy, and having\r\nalso repaired the works of Almeida, he marched the greater part of his\r\narmy to the valley of the Guadiana, and invested Badajoz, which is on\r\nthe left side of that river, on the 16th March 1812.\r\n\r\nWellington fully appreciated the immense value of time, and if he did\r\nnot actually work with his eyes on the clock, he always endeavoured to\r\nfix a definite date for his operations. Thus as early as the preceding\r\nJanuary he had written to his brother from Gallegos, a little to the\r\nnorth of Ciudad, that it was probable he would be in readiness to\r\ninvest the place “in the second week in March.” “We shall have great\r\nadvantages in making the attack so early if the weather will allow of\r\nit,” he tells another correspondent. “First, all the torrents in this\r\npart of the country are then full, so that we may assemble nearly our\r\nwhole army on the Guadiana, without risk to anything valuable here.[71]\r\nSecondly, it will be convenient to assemble our army at an early period\r\nin Estremadura, for the sake of the green forage, which comes in\r\nearlier to the south than here. Thirdly, we shall have advantages, in\r\npoint of subsistence, over the enemy, at that season, which we should\r\nnot have at a later period. Fourthly, their operations will necessarily\r\nbe confined by the swelling of the rivers in that part as well as\r\nhere.” In order to deceive the enemy he remained behind with the 5th\r\nDivision as long as possible and gave instructions for a report to be\r\ncirculated to the effect that he was going to hunt on the banks of the\r\nHuelbra and Yeltes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nBadajoz and Salamanca\r\n\r\n(1812)\r\n\r\n  “_I shall not give the thing up without good cause._”\r\n\r\n            WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsiderable energy was displayed by the troops in the siege\r\noperations at Badajoz, notwithstanding the persistent torrents of\r\nrain which soaked the men to the skin and filled the trenches as they\r\nworked. A bridge of pontoons was carried away and the flying bridges\r\nirretrievably injured by the swollen state of the Guadiana. The place\r\nwas by no means an easy one to take, for strong outworks defended it,\r\nand Philippon, the French Governor, was a most able officer in whom his\r\ntroops placed every confidence. However, good fortune did not attend\r\nthe first sortie made by about 2000 of the enemy on the 19th March.\r\nThey were “almost immediately driven in, without effecting any object,\r\nwith considerable loss, by Major-General Bowes, who commanded the guard\r\nin the trenches,” to quote from Wellington’s official dispatch.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th an attack was made on fort Picurina, an advanced post\r\nseparated from Badajoz by the little river called the Rivillas.\r\nTwenty-eight guns in six batteries were brought to bear upon it, and\r\nafter dark the place was carried by storm, although it was protected\r\nby three rows of palisades defended by musketry. The garrison of the\r\noutwork consisted of about 250 men. Of these ninety, including the\r\ncolonel, were taken prisoners, and most of the others were either\r\nkilled or drowned in the swollen stream. An attempt was made to succour\r\nthe brave defenders, but the soldiers were driven back before they\r\ncould come up to the Picurina. The possession of this outwork enabled\r\nWellington to place guns within 300 yards of the body of the place,\r\nand on the following day two breaching batteries began their work of\r\ndestruction, with the result that on the 6th April three breaches were\r\ndeclared to be practicable.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock that night the attempt was to be made, the 3rd Division\r\nunder Picton escalading the castle, the 4th Division with General\r\nthe Hon. C. Colville attacking the bastion of La Trinidad, the Light\r\nDivision commanded by Colonel Barnard the bastion of Santa Maria,\r\nGeneral Leith’s 5th Division the bastion of San Vincente. The attack on\r\nthe bastions was to be made by storming the breaches. Wellington stood\r\non rising ground facing the main breach, accompanied by the Prince of\r\nOrange and Lord March.\r\n\r\n“When the head of the Light Division arrived at the ditch of the place\r\n(the great breach) it was a beautiful moonlight night,” Sir Harry\r\nSmith relates with the authority of a participant in the action.[72]\r\n“Old Alister Cameron, who was in command of four Companies of the\r\n95th Regiment, extended along the counterscarp to attract the enemy’s\r\nfire, while the column planted their ladders and descended, came up\r\nto Barnard and said, ‘Now my men are ready; shall I begin?’ ‘No,\r\ncertainly not,’ says Barnard. The breach and the works were full of\r\nthe enemy, looking quietly at us, but not fifty yards off and most\r\nprepared, although _not firing a shot_. So soon as our ladders were\r\nall ready posted, and the columns in the very act to move and rush\r\ndown the ladders, Barnard called out, ‘_Now_, Cameron!’ and the first\r\nshot from us brought down such a hail of fire as I shall never forget,\r\nnor ever saw before or since. It was most murderous. We flew down\r\nthe ladders and rushed at the breach, but we were broken, and carried\r\nno weight with us, although every soldier was a hero. The breach was\r\ncovered by a breastwork from behind, and ably defended on the top by\r\n_chevaux-de-frises_ of sword-blades, sharp as razors, chained to the\r\nground; while the ascent to the top of the breach was covered with\r\nplanks with sharp nails in them.... One of the officers of the forlorn\r\nhope, lieutenant Taggart of the 43rd, was hanging on my arm--a mode we\r\nadopted to help each other up, for the ascent was most difficult and\r\nsteep. A Rifleman stood among the sword-blades on the top of one of\r\nthe _chevaux-de-frises_. We made a glorious rush to follow, but, alas!\r\nin vain. He was knocked over. My old captain, O’Hare, who commanded\r\nthe storming party, was killed. All were awfully wounded except, I do\r\nbelieve, myself and little Freer of the 43rd. I had been some seconds\r\nat the _revétement_ of the bastion near the breach, and my red-coat\r\npockets were literally filled with chips of stones splintered by\r\nmusket-balls. Those not knocked down were driven back by this hail of\r\nmortality to the ladders. At the foot of them I saw poor Colonel McLeod\r\nwith his hands on his breast.... He said, ‘Oh, Smith, I am mortally\r\nwounded. Help me up the ladder.’ I said, ‘Oh, no, dear fellow!’ ‘I am,’\r\nhe said; ‘be quick!’ I did so, and came back again. Little Freer and\r\nI said, ‘Let us throw down the ladders; the fellows shan’t go out.’\r\nSome soldiers behind said, ‘... if you do we will bayonet you!’ and\r\nwe were literally forced up with the crowd. My sash had got loose,\r\nand one end of it was fast in the ladder, and the bayonet was very\r\nnearly applied, but the sash by pulling became loose. So soon as we got\r\non the glacis, up came a fresh Brigade of the Portuguese of the 4th\r\nDivision. I never saw any soldiers behave with more pluck. Down into\r\nthe ditch we all went again, but the more we tried to get up, the more\r\nwe were destroyed. The 4th Division followed us in marching up to the\r\nbreach, and they made a most uncommon noise. The French saw us, but\r\ntook no notice.... Both Divisions were fairly beaten back; we never\r\ncarried either breach (nominally there were two breaches).... There is\r\nno battle, day or night, I would not willingly react except this. The\r\nmurder of our gallant officers and soldiers is not to be believed.”\r\n\r\nThe attack on the castle was no less furious. Again and again the\r\nladders were hurled back, but they were always put in place again,\r\nnotwithstanding the fearful and continuous fire to which the assailants\r\nwere subjected. Great beams of timber, stones, everything calculated to\r\nkill or maim a man were regarded as useful weapons by the defenders.\r\nNothing came amiss to them in their determined defence. Scores of\r\nsoldiers were flung down, when another minute of safety would have\r\nenabled them to secure a footing on the ramparts. They fell in the\r\nditch, often injuring or killing others besides themselves. At last\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Ridge managed to place two ladders at a spot which\r\nhad not been used before, and where the wall was lower. The officer\r\nscaled one, followed by his men, and reached the rampart. The surprised\r\ngarrison was repulsed, and very soon the castle was in the hands of the\r\nBritish. Poor Ridge did not live to reap his richly-deserved reward. He\r\nwas killed before the conclusion of the assault.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wellington at Badajos congratulating Colonel Watson\r\n\r\nR. Caton Woodville]\r\n\r\nA little while previous to the successful termination of the attack Dr\r\nJames McGregor and Dr Forbes approached Wellington. “His lordship,”\r\nsays the former, “was so intent on what was going on, that I believe he\r\ndid not observe us. Soon after our arrival, an officer came up with an\r\nunfavourable report of the assault, announcing that Colonel McLeod and\r\nseveral officers were killed, with heaps of men who choked the approach\r\nto the breach. At the place where we stood we were within hearing of\r\nthe voices of the assailants and the assailed, and it was now painful\r\nto notice that the voices of our countrymen had grown fainter, while\r\nthe French cry of ‘_Avancez, étrillons ces Anglais_,’ became\r\nstronger. Another officer came up with still more unfavourable reports,\r\nthat no progress was being made, for almost all the officers were\r\nkilled, and none left to lead on the men, of whom a great many had\r\nfallen.\r\n\r\n“At this moment I cast my eyes on the countenance of Lord Wellington,\r\nlit up by the glare of the torch held by Lord March. I never shall\r\nforget it to the last moment of my existence, and I could even now\r\nsketch it. The jaw had fallen, the face was of unusual length, while\r\nthe torch-light gave his countenance a lurid aspect; but still the\r\nexpression of the face was fair. Suddenly turning to me and putting his\r\nhand on my arm, he said, ‘Go over immediately to Picton, and tell him\r\nhe must try if he cannot succeed on the castle.’ I replied, ‘My lord,\r\nI have not my horse with me, but I will walk as fast as I can, and I\r\nthink I can find the way; I know part of the road is swampy.’ ‘No, no,’\r\nhe replied, ‘I beg your pardon, I thought it was De Lancey.’ I repeated\r\nmy offer, saying I was sure I could find the way, but he said ‘No.’\r\n\r\n“Another officer arrived, asking loudly, ‘Where is Lord Wellington?’\r\nHe came to announce that Picton was in the castle. He was desired\r\ninstantly to go to the breach, and to request the stormers to renew\r\ntheir efforts, announcing what had befallen; and immediately Lord\r\nWellington called for his own horse, and followed by the Prince and\r\nLord March, rode to the breach.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Walker, leading the assault on San Vincente, experienced\r\nmuch the same rough treatment as the other divisions, but eventually\r\nsucceeded in forcing his way into the town.\r\n\r\nPhilippon and a few hundred men managed to cross the Guadiana and found\r\nrefuge in Fort San Christoval, only to surrender the following morning.\r\nThe price paid by the victors in dead and wounded during the siege was\r\nnearly 5000 men; those of the enemy who laid down their arms numbered\r\nsome 3800. The glory of the triumphant army was unfortunately tarnished\r\nby the gross misconduct of the men, and it was not until a gallows was\r\nraised that a stop was put to their evil ways.\r\n\r\nWellington was now anxious to meet Soult as soon as Badajoz was put in\r\na state of defence, but when he received the ill news of the defeat of\r\nthe French garrison the Marshal promptly retired to Seville. As Marmont\r\nwas threatening Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo the British General had\r\nno alternative but to turn northward. He had to thank the Spaniards\r\nfor this. By neglecting to provision the places they had practically\r\nplaced them at the mercy of the enemy should he appear in considerable\r\nnumbers. They were already blockading the latter place. “If Ciudad\r\nRodrigo had been provisioned,” Wellington writes to his brother Henry,\r\n“as I had a right to expect, there was nothing to prevent me from\r\nmarching to Seville at the head of 40,000 men, the moment the siege of\r\nBadajoz was concluded.” It was, of course, very important that the line\r\nof communication between Marmont and Soult should be impeded as much as\r\npossible, and Hill was given this important task. Failing to surprise\r\nAlmarez, the General pushed on to Fort Napoleon, on the other side of\r\nthe Tagus, which was captured as well as Fort Ragusa. False information\r\nalone prevented Hill from following up his victories. He was told that\r\nSoult was in Estremadura, and he withdrew to the Guadiana.\r\n\r\nWellington began his advance, and on the 13th June crossed the\r\nAgueda. On his approach to Salamanca he at once laid siege to three\r\nnewly-erected forts, “each defending the other.” Marmont, knowing the\r\nlikelihood of such an event, had wisely stored a good supply of food in\r\nthem, so that there was a likelihood of their being able to hold out\r\nuntil he could succour them. The Marshal made one or two demonstrations\r\nto no good effect. He as obstinately declined to begin offensive\r\nmeasures as Wellington declined to be enticed to leave his strong\r\nposition on the heights of San Christoval.\r\n\r\nIt took Wellington some time to secure the forts, which were well\r\nbuilt and equipped, but on the 27th they fell into his hands, two\r\nby storm and one by capitulation. The last mentioned was being\r\nattacked when the flag was hauled down and would doubtless have been\r\ncaptured had not the commander given way before the British made good\r\ntheir assault. Marmont thereupon retired behind the Douro to await\r\nreinforcements.\r\n\r\nAfter having destroyed some military works at Alba de Tormes and\r\ngarrisoned the castle of Salamanca with Spaniards, Wellington pushed\r\nforward and engaged Marmont’s rearguard on the 2nd July. He took up a\r\nposition on the left bank of the Douro, on the opposite side of that\r\noccupied by the enemy, who was shortly afterwards strengthened by the\r\nsupport of Bonnet’s division from the Asturias. Near Tordesillas, which\r\nwith Toro and Tudela was held by the French, the Marshal took courage\r\nand fought an action with Sir Stapleton Cotton, who was in command of\r\nWellington’s right, on the 18th July. To resist him was impossible,\r\nfor he had secured all the bridges and many of the fords. The action\r\nbegan at dawn, and Cotton gallantly maintained his post, but the enemy\r\nmanaged to turn the left flank of the British position. “The troops,”\r\nsays Wellington in his official report, “retired in admirable order to\r\nTorrecilla de la Orden, having the enemy’s whole army on their flank,\r\nor in their rear, and thence to Guareña, which river they passed under\r\nthe same circumstances, and effected their junction with the army.”\r\n\r\nWellington fell back to within two miles of Salamanca, his left resting\r\non the Tormes, his right abutting on two hills called Los Aripeles;[73]\r\nMarmont secured the heights of Nuestra Señora de la Peña.\r\n\r\nMany years after the battle of Salamanca, General Alava, a Spanish\r\nofficer at the British headquarters, was at Wellington’s breakfast\r\ntable at Walmer, and he regaled the company with the story of the great\r\nsoldier’s breakfast on the 22nd July 1812. Croker has recorded it for\r\nus, with the comment that the Duke listened “as quietly as if it\r\nrelated to another person.”\r\n\r\n“The Duke had been very busy all the morning, and had not thought of\r\nbreakfast, and the staff had grown very hungry; at last, however, there\r\nwas a pause (I think he said about two) near a farmyard surrounded by\r\na wall, where a kind of breakfast was spread on the ground, and the\r\nstaff alighted and fell to; while they were eating, the Duke rode into\r\nthe enclosure; he refused to alight, and advised them to make haste;\r\nhe seemed anxious and on the look-out. At last they persuaded him to\r\ntake a bit of bread and the leg of a cold roast fowl, which he was\r\neating without knife from his fingers, when suddenly they saw him throw\r\nthe leg of the fowl far away over his shoulder, and gallop out of the\r\nyard, calling to them to follow him. The fact is, he had been waiting\r\nto have the French _sighted_ at a certain gap in the hills, and that\r\nwas to be the signal of a long-meditated and long-suspended attack. ‘I\r\nknew,’ says Alava, with grave drollery, ‘that something _very serious\r\nwas about to happen when an article so precious as the leg of a roast\r\nfowl was thus thrown away_.’” Croker adds that “the Duke sat by with\r\nhis head inclined, quite silent, but with a quiet smile which seemed to\r\nsay that the narration was a good deal pleasanter than the reality had\r\nbeen.”\r\n\r\nWellington was able to seize the nearer hill but the French secured the\r\nother, while another miniature height named Nuestra Señora de la Peña\r\nwas the centre of a most desperate conflict, which continued through\r\nthe long hours of the day. Marmont made the fatal error of dividing his\r\narmy, sending Thomière’s division to turn the British right flank, with\r\nintent to cut off all hope of retreat on the part of Wellington, should\r\nhe wish to do so, by means of the Ciudad Rodrigo road. This movement\r\nseparated the French left wing from the centre, and this it was that\r\ncaused the British Commander to fling away the dearly prized leg of a\r\nchicken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The End of Breakfast\r\n\r\nThomas Maybank]\r\n\r\nAfter looking through his glass with wrapt attention Wellington\r\nturned to his Spanish colleague with the words, “My dear Alava, Marmont\r\nis undone!” His active brain told him at once of his enemy’s mistake.\r\nHaving made his dispositions he ordered Pakenham, his brother-in-law,\r\nto throw the 3rd Division into line and cross the march of Thomière’s\r\ncolumns. “It shall be done; give me your hand,” replied that energetic\r\nofficer. He hurled the Portuguese cavalry, two squadrons of the 14th\r\nLight Dragoons, and the “Fighting 3rd” at the flank and rear of the\r\nFrench left. Other divisions under Cole, Leith, Bradford, and Cotton\r\nattacked the enemy in front. “No sooner was Pakenham in motion towards\r\nthe heights,” says one who took part in the battle, “than the ridge he\r\nwas about to assail was crowned with twenty pieces of cannon, while\r\nin the rear of this battery were seen Foy’s division, endeavouring to\r\nregain its place in the combat. A flat space of 1000 yards in breadth\r\nwas to be crossed before Pakenham could reach the height.\r\n\r\n“The French batteries opened a heavy fire, while the two brigades of\r\nartillery, commanded by Captain Douglas, posted on a rising ground\r\nbehind the 3rd Division, replied to them with much warmth. Pakenham’s\r\nmen may thus be said to have been between two fires, that of our own\r\nguns firing over their heads, while the French balls passed through\r\ntheir ranks, ploughing up the ground in every direction; but the\r\nveteran troops which composed the 3rd Division were not shaken even by\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n“Wallace’s three regiments advanced in open columns, until within 250\r\nyards of the ridge held by the French infantry. Foy’s column, 5000\r\nstrong, had by this time reached their ground, while in their front the\r\nface of the hill had been hastily garnished with riflemen. All were\r\nimpatient to engage, and the calm but stern advance of Pakenham’s right\r\nbrigade was received with beating of drums and loud cheers from the\r\nFrench, whose light troops, hoping to take advantage of the time which\r\nthe deploying into line would take, ran down the face of the hill in a\r\nstate of great excitement, but Pakenham, who was naturally of a boiling\r\nspirit and hasty temper, was on this day perfectly cool. He told\r\nWallace to form line from open column without halting, and thus the\r\ndifferent companies, by throwing forward their right shoulders, were in\r\na line without the slow manœuvre of deployment.\r\n\r\n“Astonished at the rapidity of the movement, the French riflemen\r\ncommenced an irregular and hurried fire, and even at this early stage\r\nof the battle a looker-on could, from the difference in the demeanour\r\nof the troops of the two nations, form a tolerably correct opinion\r\nof what the result would be. Regardless of the fire of the riflemen,\r\nand the showers of grape and canister, Pakenham continued to press\r\nforward; his centre suffered, but still advanced; his right and left,\r\nbeing less oppressed by the weight of the fire, continued to advance at\r\na more rapid pace, and as his wings inclined forward and outstripped\r\nthe centre, his right brigade assumed the form of a crescent. The\r\nmanœuvre was a bold as well as a novel one, and the appearance of\r\nthe brigade imposing and unique; because it so happened that all the\r\nBritish officers were in front of their men--a rare occurrence. The\r\nFrench officers were also in front, but their relative duties were\r\nwidely different--the latter encouraging their men into the heat of the\r\nbattle--the former keeping their devoted soldiers back--what a splendid\r\nnational contrast!”\r\n\r\nWhen the brow of the hill was reached the men were subjected to a\r\nmurderous hail of fire from Foy’s division. Nearly all of Wallace’s\r\nfirst rank, as well as many officers, fell beneath it. But the others,\r\nurged by their commander, pressed on with fixed bayonets, and the\r\nFrench troops were forced backward. Thomière was amongst the killed,\r\nand many were taken prisoners in the rout which followed.\r\n\r\n“Immediately on our left,” the narrative continues, “the 5th Division\r\nwere discharging vollies against the French 4th; and Pack’s brigade\r\ncould be seen mounting the Aripeles height, but disregarding\r\neverything except the complete destruction of the column before him,\r\nPakenham followed it with the brigade of Wallace, supported by the\r\nreserves of his division.\r\n\r\n“The battle at this point would have been decided on the moment,\r\nhad the heavy horse under Le Marchant been near enough to sustain\r\nhim. The confusion of the enemy was so great that they became mixed\r\npell-mell together, without any regard to order or regularity, and it\r\nwas manifest that nothing short of a miracle could save Foy from total\r\ndestruction. Sir Edward Pakenham continued to press on at the head of\r\nWallace’s brigade, but Foy’s troops outran him. Had Le Marchant been\r\naware of this state of the combat, or been near enough to profit by\r\nit, Pakenham would have settled the business by six o’clock instead\r\nof seven. An hour, at any period during a battle, is a serious loss\r\nof time, but in this action every moment was of vital import. Day was\r\nrapidly drawing to a close: the Tormes was close behind the army of\r\nMarmont, ruin stared him in the face; in a word, his left wing was\r\ndoubled up--lost; and Pakenham could have turned to the support of the\r\n4th and 5th Divisions, had our cavalry been ready to back Wallace at\r\nthe moment he pierced the column. This, beyond doubt, was the moment\r\nby which to profit, that the enemy might not have time to re-collect\r\nhimself; but, while Le Marchant was preparing to take part in the\r\ncombat, Foy, with admirable presence of mind, remedied the terrible\r\nconfusion of his division, and calling up a first brigade to his\r\nsupport, once more led his men into the fight, assumed the offensive,\r\nand Pakenham was now about to be assailed in turn. This was the most\r\ncritical moment of the battle; Boyer’s horsemen stood before us,\r\ninclining towards our right, which was flanked by two squadrons of\r\nthe 14th Dragoons and two regiments of Portuguese cavalry; but we had\r\nlittle dependence upon the Portuguese, and it behoved us to look to\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n“Led on by the ardour of conquest, we had followed the column until\r\nat length we found ourselves in an open plain, intersected with\r\ncork trees, opposed by a multitude, who, reinforced, again rallied,\r\nand turned upon us with fury. Pakenham, Wallace, Seton, and Mackie,\r\nrode along the line from wing to wing, almost from rank to rank, and\r\nfulfilled the functions of adjutants in assisting the officers to\r\nreorganise the tellings-off of the men for square. Meanwhile the first\r\nbattalion of the 5th drove back some squadrons of Boyer’s dragoons; the\r\nother six regiments were fast approaching the point held by Wallace,\r\nbut the French cavalry in our front and upon our right flank caused\r\nPakenham some uneasiness.\r\n\r\n“The peals of musketry along the centre still continued without\r\nintermission; the smoke was so thick that nothing to our left was\r\ndistinguishable; some men of the 5th Division got intermingled with\r\nours; the dry grass was set on fire by the numerous cartridge papers\r\nthat strewed the field of battle; the air was scorching, and the smoke\r\nrolling on in huge volumes, nearly suffocated us.\r\n\r\n“A loud cheering was heard in our rear--the brigade turned half round,\r\nsupposing themselves about to be attacked by the French cavalry. A few\r\nseconds passed--the trampling of horse was heard--the smoke cleared\r\naway, and the heavy brigade of Le Marchant was seen coming forward in a\r\nline at a canter. ‘Open right and left,’ was an order quickly obeyed;\r\nthe line opened, the cavalry passed through the intervals, and forming\r\nrapidly in our front prepared for their work.\r\n\r\n“The French column, which a moment before held so imposing an attitude,\r\nbecame startled at this unexpected sight. A victorious and highly\r\nexcited infantry pressed closely upon them; a splendid brigade of three\r\nregiments of cavalry, ready to burst through their ill-arranged and\r\nbeaten column, while no appearance of succour was at hand to protect\r\nthem, was enough to appal the boldest intrepidity. The plain was filled\r\nwith the vast multitude; retreat was impossible, and the troopers\r\ncame still pouring in, to join their comrades already prepared for\r\nthe attack. It was too much for their nerves, and they sank under its\r\ninfluence, although they bravely made an effort to face the danger.\r\n\r\n“Hastily, yet with much regularity, all things considered, they\r\nattempted to get into the square; but Le Marchant’s brigade galloped\r\nforward before the evolution was half completed.\r\n\r\n“The column hesitated, wavered, tottered, and then stood still! The\r\nmotion of the countless bayonets, as they clashed together, might be\r\nlikened to a forest about to be assailed by a tempest, whose first\r\nwarnings announce the ravage it is about to inflict. Foy’s division\r\nvomited forth a dreadful volley of fire as the horsemen thundered\r\nacross the flat; Le Marchant was killed,[74] and fell downright in\r\nthe midst of the French bayonets; but his brigade pierced through the\r\nvast mass, killing or trampling down all before them. The conflict was\r\nsevere, and the troopers fell thick and fast, but their long, heavy\r\nswords, cut through bone as well as flesh....\r\n\r\n“Such as got away from the sabres of the horsemen, sought safety among\r\nthe ranks of our infantry, and scrambling under the horses, ran to\r\nus for protection, like men who, having escaped the first shock of\r\na wreck, will cling to any broken spar, no matter how little to be\r\ndepended on. Hundreds of beings frightfully disfigured, in whom the\r\nhuman face and form were almost obliterated--black with dust, worn down\r\nwith fatigue, and covered with sabre cuts and blood--threw themselves\r\namong us for safety. Not a man was bayoneted--not even molested or\r\nplundered.”\r\n\r\nThe battle still raged with unabated fury; “immediately in front of the\r\n5th Division, Leith fell wounded as he led on his men, but his division\r\ncarried the point in dispute, and drove the enemy before them up the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\n“While these events were taking place on the right, the 4th Division,\r\nwhich formed the centre of the army, met with a serious opposition.\r\nThe more distant Aripeles, occupied by the French 122nd, whose numbers\r\ndid not count more than 400, supported by a few pieces of cannon, was\r\nleft to the Portuguese brigade of General Pack, amounting to 2000\r\nbayonets. Falsely, though with well-founded reliance--their former\r\nconduct taken into the scale--Cole’s division advanced into the plain,\r\nconfident that all was right with Pack’s troops, and a terrible\r\nstruggle between them and Bonnet’s corps took place. It was, however,\r\nbut of short duration. Bonnet’s troops were driven back in confusion,\r\nand up to this moment all had gone on well.\r\n\r\n“The three British Divisions engaged, overthrew all obstacles, and\r\nthe battle might be said to be won, had Pack’s formidable brigade\r\n(formidable in numbers, at least) fulfilled their part--but these men\r\ntotally failed in their effort to take the height occupied only by a\r\nfew hundred Frenchmen, and thus gave the park of artillery that was\r\nposted with them, full liberty to turn its efforts against the rear\r\nand flank of Cole’s soldiers. Nothing could be worse than the state in\r\nwhich the 4th Division was now placed, and the battle, which ought to\r\nhave been and had been in a manner won, was still in doubt.\r\n\r\n“Bonnet, seeing the turn which Pack’s failure had wrought in his\r\nfavour, re-formed his men, and advanced against Cole, while the fire\r\nfrom the battery and small arms on the Aripeles height completed the\r\nconfusion. Cole fell wounded; half of his division were cut off; the\r\nremainder in full retreat, and Bonnet’s troops pressing on in a compact\r\nbody, made it manifest that a material change had taken place in the\r\nbattle, and that ere it was gained some ugly up-hill work was yet to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charge of Pakenham’s Third Division at Salamanca\r\n\r\nR. Caton Woodville]\r\n\r\n“Marshal Beresford, who arrived at this moment, galloped up to the\r\nhead of a brigade of the 5th Division, which he took out of the second\r\nline, and for a moment covered the retreat of Cole’s troops; but\r\nthis force--composed of Portuguese--was insufficient to arrest the\r\nprogress of the enemy, who advanced in the full confidence of an\r\nassured victory, and at this moment Beresford was carried off the field\r\nwounded. Bonnet’s troops advanced, uttering loud cheers, while the\r\nentire of Cole’s division and Spry’s brigade of Portuguese were routed.\r\nOur centre was thus endangered. Boyer’s dragoons, after the overthrow\r\nof the French left, countermarched, and moved rapidly to the support of\r\nBonnet; they were also close in the track of his infantry; and the fate\r\nof this momentous battle might be said to hang by a hair. The fugitives\r\nof the 7th and 4th French Divisions ran to the succour of Bonnet,\r\nand by the time they had joined him, his force had, indeed, assumed\r\na formidable aspect, and thus reinforced it stood in an attitude far\r\ndifferent from what it would have done, had Pack’s brigade succeeded in\r\nits attack.\r\n\r\n“Lord Wellington, who saw what had taken place by the failure of Pack’s\r\ntroops, ordered up the 6th Division to the support of the 4th, and the\r\nbattle, although it was half-past 8 o’clock at night, recommenced with\r\nthe same fury as at the outset.\r\n\r\n“Clinton’s division, consisting of 6000 bayonets, rapidly advanced to\r\noccupy its place in the combat, and relieve the 4th from the awkward\r\npredicament in which it was placed, and essayed to gain what was lost\r\nby the failure of Pack’s troops, in their feeble effort to wrest the\r\nAripeles height from a few brave Frenchmen; but they were received\r\nby Bonnet’s troops at the point of the bayonet, and the fire opened\r\nagainst them seemed to be three-fold more heavy than that sustained by\r\nthe 3rd and 5th Divisions. It was nearly dark, and the great glare of\r\nlight caused by the thunder of the artillery, the continued blaze of\r\nmusketry, and the burning grass, gave to the face of the hill a novel\r\nand terrific appearance--it was one vast sheet of flame, and Clinton’s\r\nmen looked as if they were attacking a burning mountain, the crater of\r\nwhich was defended by a barrier of shining steel. But nothing could\r\nstop the intrepid valour of the 6th Division, as they advanced with\r\ndesperate resolution to carry the hill.\r\n\r\n“The troops posted on the face of it to arrest their advance were\r\ntrampled down and destroyed at the first charge, and each reserve sent\r\nforward to extricate them met with the same fate.\r\n\r\n“Still Bonnet’s reserves having attained their place in the fight, and\r\nthe fugitives from Foy’s division joining them at the moment, prolonged\r\nthe battle until dark.\r\n\r\n“These men, besmeared with blood, dust, and clay, half naked, and some\r\ncarrying only broken weapons, fought with a fury not to be surpassed;\r\nbut their impetuosity was at length calmed by the bayonets of Clinton’s\r\ntroops, and they no longer fought for victory, but for safety. After a\r\ndesperate struggle they were driven from their last hold in confusion,\r\nand a general and overwhelming charge, which the nature of the ground\r\nenabled Clinton’s troops to make, carried this ill-formed mass of\r\ndesperate soldiers before them, as a shattered wreck borne along by the\r\nforce of some mighty current. The mingled mass of fugitives fled to\r\nthe woods and to the river for safety, and under cover of the night,\r\nsucceeded in gaining the pass of Alba, over the Tormes. It was 10\r\no’clock at night--the battle was ended.”\r\n\r\nMarmont, who was wounded in the early part of the fight, lost 15,000\r\nmen, of whom 7000 surrendered to the British. The victors had nearly\r\n700 officers and men killed, and over 4500 returned as wounded and\r\nmissing. Six British Generals, including Wellington, whose thigh was\r\ngrazed by a musket ball which had fortunately passed through his\r\nholster before it hit him, received injuries, and Le Marchant, as\r\nalready mentioned, was shot. Of the enemy four Generals were wounded\r\nand three killed, sufficient proof of the sanguinary nature of the\r\nlong-continued contest. The victory would have been even more complete\r\nhad the Spanish garrison at Alba de Tormes remained at their post\r\ninstead of withdrawing without informing the Commander-in-Chief of\r\ntheir intention. As a consequence the enemy were enabled to use the\r\nbridge there and make good their escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nThe Closing Battles of the Peninsular War\r\n\r\n(1812-14)\r\n\r\n  “_In the whole of my experience I never saw an army so strongly\r\n  posted as the French at the battle of Toulouse. There ought to have\r\n  been an accurate plan and description made of the whole affair as a\r\n  matter of professional science._”\r\n\r\n            WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarmont’s army was not the only one in retreat. King Joseph, with\r\n15,000 troops, had left Madrid with the set purpose of joining the\r\nMarshal, but when he received news of the battle of Salamanca he\r\nretreated on Valencia, where Suchet’s army was posted, and peremptorily\r\nordered Soult to evacuate Andalusia. This would enable him to bring\r\n90,000 men to bear on his victorious enemy. His withdrawal from\r\nMadrid enabled Wellington to enter the capital on the 12th August\r\n1812, Marmont, or rather Clausel, who had temporarily succeeded\r\nhim, being driven back upon Burgos. The evacuation of the southern\r\nprovince was doubtless very gratifying to the Spaniards, but the\r\nthreatened concentration of such a vast array of troops placed the\r\nAnglo-Portuguese army in an extremely unhappy position. The force at\r\nWellington’s disposal numbered 60,000 men, and although an additional\r\n6000 had just landed at Alicante, in Valencia, it was evident that\r\nthey would be of little service at the moment. When he became aware\r\nthat Soult was about to abandon Andalusia he left part of his army to\r\noccupy Madrid, and with the remainder set out in the hope of being able\r\nto crush Clausel, who was at Valladolid. This he was unable to do, for\r\nthe enemy retired from position to position. He followed him to Burgos,\r\nwhich Wellington entered, the French General meanwhile encamping on the\r\nbanks of the Ebro, where he shortly afterwards received substantial\r\nreinforcements under Caffarelli and Souham the latter of whom arrived\r\nas Marmont’s successor. Wellington was also joined by some 11,000\r\nSpanish troops of the army of Galicia. He at once laid siege to the\r\ncastle above the town, which was strongly defended, and although the\r\ntroops worked with praiseworthy ardour and four attempts were made to\r\ntake it by assault, he was eventually forced to abandon the idea, and\r\nfor a very important reason. Soult had joined King Joseph, and the\r\ncombined army was on its way to Madrid. He had wasted a precious month,\r\ntime which the French had used to full advantage.\r\n\r\nIt is related that one of the Irish regiments incurred his displeasure\r\nduring the siege, and some of its members asked permission for it to\r\nlead one of the assaults. Their wish was granted, with the result that\r\nnearly all the men laid down their lives in the desperate undertaking.\r\nWhen Wellington passed a little later, a soldier who had lost both\r\nhis legs saluted and cried, “Arrah, maybe ye’r satisfied now, you\r\nhooky-nosed vagabond!” The Commander could not restrain a smile, and\r\npromptly sent assistance. The Irishman ended his days in Chelsea\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nSending word to Hill to abandon Madrid and meet him on the Tormes,\r\nWellington skilfully withdrew his men from Burgos, and although his\r\nrear-guard was much harassed by Souham’s troops, he formed a junction\r\nwith his lieutenant near the battlefield of Salamanca. On arrival\r\non the Tormes they were almost face to face with the united army,\r\nbut divided counsels reigned, and he skilfully eluded the French,\r\nalthough they turned his position. Aided by a dense fog, Wellington\r\nmanaged to slip away unperceived. After a sharp engagement at a ford\r\nof the Huebra, the pursuers abandoned the attempt to secure the roads\r\nto Ciudad Rodrigo, which place was reached by Wellington on the 18th\r\nNovember. Soult retired to Toledo, Souham to Valladolid, and Joseph to\r\nSegovia.\r\n\r\nA pen-sketch of the men during this terrible retreat tells us that\r\n“such a set of scare-crows never was seen. It was difficult to say what\r\nthey were, as the men’s coats were patched with grey, some had blankets\r\nover them, and most were barefooted; every step they took was up to\r\nthe knees in mud; women and sick men were actually sticking in it....\r\nA brigade of cavalry, however, which was covering the rear, had left\r\nLisbon but a short time before, and was in high order. The clothing of\r\nthe men scarcely soiled, and the horses sleek and fat, made a strange\r\ncontrast with the others, especially the company of artillery that had\r\nserved in the batteries before Burgos. We at first took the latter for\r\nprisoners, as they were mostly in French clothing, many of them riding\r\nin the carriages with the sick and wounded, drawn, some by oxen, and\r\nsome by mules and horses. I never saw British soldiers in such a state.”\r\n\r\nWellington and his men then went into cantonments, the former making\r\nhis headquarters at Freneda. Much was done to improve the _morale_ of\r\nthe troops, who had got into a very insubordinate state. Reinforcements\r\ncame to hand, and Wellington worked hard to reorganize the Spanish\r\narmy, of which he had been appointed Generalissimo after the battle of\r\nSalamanca. He had also been raised to the rank of Marquis, thanked by\r\nboth Houses of Parliament, and presented with £100,000. He paid a visit\r\nto the Cortes, made a speech, and wrote a long letter to one of the\r\nDeputies in which he criticized “the powers that be” in no uncertain\r\nway, adding, however, a number of measures which would “give your\r\nGovernment some chance of standing, and your country some chance of\r\navoiding farther revolutions.” The whole communication must be studied\r\nto be fully appreciated.[75] “The Government and the Assembly,” he says\r\nin one passage, “instead of drawing together, are like two independent\r\npowers, jealous and afraid of each other; and the consequence is,\r\nthat the machine of Government is at a stand. To this add that the\r\nwhole system is governed by little local views, as propounded by the\r\ndaily press of Cadiz, of all others the least enlightened and the most\r\nlicentious.” “I will fight for Spain as long as she is the enemy of\r\nFrance, whatever may be her system of government,” he adds, “but I\r\ncannot avoid seeing and lamenting the evils which await the country\r\nif you do not retrace your steps, let what will be the result of the\r\nmilitary operations of the war....”\r\n\r\nHe advised the establishment of a permanent Regency, “with all the\r\npowers allotted by the constitution to the King, in the hands of one\r\nperson.” He, or she, should be aided by a Council, whose five members\r\nshould superintend the Department de Estado, the Interior and Ultramar,\r\nGracia y Justicia, Hacienda, and of War and of Marine respectively,\r\neach being responsible for the department under his superintendence. He\r\nsuggested either turning “the Council of State into a House of Lords,”\r\nor making “a House of Lords of the Grandees, giving then concurrent\r\npowers of legislation with the Cortes; and you should leave the\r\npatronage now in the hands of the Council of State in the hands of the\r\nCrown.”\r\n\r\nIn these days of Socialism the following remarks, which occur in\r\nthe same letter, are of more than passing interest. “The theory of\r\nall legislation,” he says, “is founded in justice; and, if we could\r\nbe certain that legislative assemblies would on all occasions act\r\naccording to the principles of justice, there would be no occasion\r\nfor those checks and guards which we have seen established under the\r\nbest systems. Unfortunately, however, we have seen that legislative\r\nassemblies are swayed by the fears and passions of individuals; when\r\nunchecked, they are tyrannical and unjust; nay, more: it unfortunately\r\nhappens too frequently that the most tyrannical and unjust measures are\r\nthe most popular. Those measures are particularly popular which deprive\r\nrich and powerful individuals of their properties under the pretence\r\nof the public advantage; and I tremble for a country in which, as in\r\nSpain, there is no barrier for the preservation of private property,\r\nexcepting the justice of a legislative assembly possessing supreme\r\npowers.”\r\n\r\nIn summing up the result of his operations in the field during 1812,\r\nWellington tells the Earl of Liverpool on the 23rd November, that\r\nnotwithstanding adverse criticism in the newspapers, “it is in fact the\r\nmost successful campaign in all its circumstances, and has produced for\r\nthe cause more important results than any campaign in which a British\r\narmy has been engaged for the last century. We have taken by siege\r\nCiudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, and Salamanca; and the Retiro surrendered. In\r\nthe meantime the Allies have taken Astorga, Guadalaxara, and Consuegra,\r\nbesides other places taken by Duran and Sir H. Popham. In the months\r\nelapsed since January this army has sent to England little short of\r\n20,000 prisoners, and they have taken and destroyed or have themselves\r\nthe use of the enemy’s arsenals in Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca,\r\nValladolid, Madrid, Astorga, Seville, the line before Cadiz, etc.; and\r\nupon the whole we have taken and destroyed, or we now possess, little\r\nshort of 3000 pieces of artillery. The siege of Cadiz has been raised,\r\nand all the countries south of the Tagus have been cleared of the enemy.\r\n\r\n“We should have retained still greater advantages, I think, and\r\nshould have remained in possession of Castile and Madrid during the\r\nwinter, if I could have taken Burgos, as I ought early in October, or\r\nif Ballasteros had moved upon Alcarez as he was ordered, instead of\r\nintriguing for his own aggrandizement.\r\n\r\n“The fault of which I was guilty in the expedition to Burgos was,\r\nnot that I undertook the operation with inadequate means, but that\r\nI took there the most inexperienced instead of the best troops....\r\nI see that a disposition already exists to blame the Government for\r\nthe failure of the siege of Burgos. The Government had nothing to say\r\nto the siege. It was entirely my own act. In regard to means, there\r\nwere ample means both at Madrid and at Santander for the siege of the\r\nstrongest fortress. That which was wanting at both places was means of\r\ntransporting ordnance and military stores to the place where it was\r\ndesirable to use them.\r\n\r\n“The people of England, so happy as they are in every respect, so rich\r\nin resources of every description, having the use of such excellent\r\nroads, etc., will not readily believe that important results here\r\nfrequently depend upon 50 or 60 mules more or less, or a few bundles\r\nof straw to feed them; but the fact is so, notwithstanding their\r\nincredulity....”\r\n\r\nWhen Wellington was ready for his 1813 campaign he had 75,000\r\nBritish and Portuguese at his disposal, and some 60,000 Spaniards,\r\nin addition to the irregular bands which were the bane of the enemy.\r\nThe different French armies totalled some 200,000 troops, but it was\r\ndeemed necessary to send 40,000 of these, under Clausel and Foy, to\r\nexterminate the _guerilleros_, which was to Wellington’s advantage,\r\nespecially as it was impossible for Napoleon, now deeply involved owing\r\nto the disastrous Russian campaign, to send further reinforcements.\r\nSoult was withdrawn, with 20,000 men, to oppose the Russian advance.\r\nBy way of further encouragement, Andalusia, Estremadura, Galacia,\r\nand the Asturias no longer sheltered the enemy. The British left\r\nwas under Graham, the right under Hill, and the centre under the\r\nCommander-in-Chief. The first marched upon Valladolid, the French\r\nretreating before him, and was joined near Zamora on the 1st June\r\n1813 by Wellington, followed two days later by Hill. The French were\r\ndeceived by these movements, for they expected the main attack to be\r\nmade from Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida with the object of occupying\r\nMadrid. This was far from Wellington’s purpose, which was to carry on\r\nthe war in the northern provinces, sever the French communications with\r\nthe homeland, and force them to withdraw to the Pyrenees. King Joseph\r\nhastily retired from Valladolid and reached Burgos. On the approach of\r\nWellington to that town, the fortifications were blown up and the enemy\r\nfell back beyond the Ebro.\r\n\r\n“When I heard and saw this explosion (for I was within a few miles,\r\nand the effect was tremendous),” Wellington remarks, “I made a sudden\r\nresolution forthwith--instanter to cross the Ebro, and endeavour to\r\npush the French to the Pyrenees. We had heard of the battles of Lützen\r\nand Bautzen and of the armistice,[76] and the affairs of the Allies\r\nlooked very ill. Some of my officers remonstrated with me about the\r\nimpudence of crossing the Ebro, and advised me to take up the line of\r\nthe Ebro, etc. I asked them what they meant by taking up the line of\r\nthe Ebro, a river 300 miles long, and what good I was to do along that\r\nline? In short, I would not listen to the advice; and that very evening\r\n(or the very next morning) I crossed the river and pushed the French\r\ntill I afterwards beat them at Vittoria.”\r\n\r\n“We continued to advance,” writes a soldier of the 71st Regiment\r\nwho fought in the battle, “until the 20th of June; when reaching\r\nthe neighbourhood of Vittoria, we encamped upon the face of a hill.\r\nProvisions were very scarce. We had not a bit of tobacco, and were\r\nsmoking leaves and herbs. Colonel Cadogan rode away, and got us half a\r\npound of tobacco a man, which was most welcome.\r\n\r\n“Next morning we got up as usual. The first pipes played for parade;\r\nthe second did not play at the usual time. We began to suspect all\r\nwas not right. We remained thus until eleven o’clock; then received\r\norders to fall in, and follow the line of march. During our march we\r\nfell to one side, to allow a brigade of guns to pass us at full speed.\r\n‘Now,’ said my comrades, ‘we will have work to do before night.’ We\r\ncrossed a river, and, as we passed through a village, we saw, on the\r\nother side of the road, the French camp, and their fires still burning,\r\njust as they had left them. Not a shot had been fired at this time. We\r\nobserved a large Spanish column moving along the heights on our right.\r\nWe halted, and drew up in column. Orders were given to brush out our\r\nlocks, oil them, and examine our flints. We being in the rear, these\r\nwere soon followed by orders to open out from the centre, to allow the\r\n71st to advance. Forward we moved up the hill. The firing was now very\r\nheavy. Our rear had not engaged, before word came for the doctor to\r\nassist Colonel Cadogan, who was wounded. Immediately we charged up the\r\nhill, the piper playing, ‘Hey Johnny Cope.’ The French had possession\r\nof the top, but we soon forced them back, and drew up in column on\r\nthe height; sending out four companies to our left to skirmish. The\r\nremainder moved on to the opposite height. As we advanced driving them\r\nbefore us, a French officer, a pretty fellow, was pricking and forcing\r\nhis men to stand. They heeded him not--he was very harsh. ‘Down with\r\nhim!’ cried one near me; and down he fell, pierced by more than one\r\nball.\r\n\r\n“Scarce were we upon the height, when a heavy column, dressed in\r\ngreat-coats, with white covers on their hats, exactly resembling\r\nthe Spanish, gave us a volley, which put us to the right about at\r\ndouble-quick time down the hill, the French close behind, through the\r\nwhins. The four companies got the word the French were on them. They\r\nlikewise thought them Spaniards, until they got a volley that killed\r\nor wounded almost every one of them. We retired to the height, covered\r\nby the 50th, who gave the pursuing column a volley which checked their\r\nspeed. We moved up the remains of our shattered regiment to the height.\r\nBeing in great want of ammunition, we were again served with sixty\r\nrounds a man, and kept up our fire for some time, until the bugle\r\nsounded to cease firing....\r\n\r\n“At this time the Major had the command, our second Colonel being\r\nwounded. There were not 300 of us on the height able to do duty, out of\r\nabove 1000 who drew rations in the morning. The cries of the wounded\r\nwere most heart-rending.\r\n\r\n“The French, on the opposite height, were getting under arms; we could\r\ngive no assistance, as the enemy appeared to be six to one of us. Our\r\norders were to maintain the height while there was a man of us. The\r\nword was given to shoulder arms. The French, at the same moment, got\r\nunder arms. The engagement began in the plains. The French were amazed,\r\nand soon put to the right about, through Vittoria. We followed, as\r\nquick as our weary limbs could carry us. Our legs were full of thorns,\r\nand our feet bruised upon the roots of the trees. Coming to a bean\r\nfield at the bottom of the heights, immediately the column was broke,\r\nand every man filled his haversack. We continued to advance until it\r\nwas dark, and then encamped on a height above Vittoria.... I had fired\r\n108 rounds this day.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the official figures the British lost 740 men by death\r\nand 4174 were wounded, out of a total strength of 80,000. The captures\r\nincluded 151 guns, 415 caissons, 14,249 rounds of ammunition, nearly\r\n2,000,000 musket ball cartridges, 40,668 lbs. of gunpowder, fifty-six\r\nforage waggons, forty-four forge waggons, treasure to the amount of\r\n£1,000,000, pictures by Velasquez and other masters, jewellery, public\r\nand private baggage. King Joseph’s carriage, and Jourdan’s bâton. The\r\nlast-mentioned was given by Wellington to the Prince Regent, who with\r\nbecoming fitness sent the donor a Field-Marshal’s bâton. The French had\r\n65,000 men engaged in the battle of Vittoria, of whom some 6000 were\r\nkilled and wounded, and 1000 taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe defeated army crossed the Pyrenees and marched to Bayonne, where it\r\nwas joined by the troops under Foy and Clausel, who had been pursued\r\nby the Allies. “To hustle the French out of Spain before they were\r\nreinforced,” had been Wellington’s object, and he had carried it out\r\ncompletely. As the garrisons of the fortresses of Pampeluna and San\r\nSebastian had been strengthened, the former by Joseph and the latter\r\nby Foy, during their retreat, Wellington now turned his attention to\r\nthem. Although the army under Suchet was the only one now left in\r\nthe Peninsula, it occupied Catalonia and part of Valencia, and might\r\ntherefore attack Wellington’s right flank.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was at Dresden when he heard of his brother’s disaster at\r\nVittoria, and he was in no mood for soft words. He recalled both\r\nJoseph and Jourdan, and gave the command to Soult. “It is hard to\r\nimagine anything so inconceivable as what is now going on in Spain,”\r\nthe Emperor writes to Savary on the 3rd July 1813. “The King could\r\nhave collected 100,000 picked men: they might have beaten the whole of\r\nEngland.” He blamed himself for the “mistaken consideration” he had\r\nshown his brother, “who not only does not know how to command, but does\r\nnot even know his own value enough to leave the military command alone.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flight of the French through Vittoria\r\n\r\nRobert Hillingford]\r\n\r\nSoult reached Bayonne on the 12th July, and thirteen days later had\r\nmarched on Pampeluna with 73,000 troops, bent on relieving one or\r\nother of the fortresses, perhaps both. He attacked the British right\r\nat Roncesvalles and turned the position; Hill was attacked at the head\r\nof the valley of Baztan and was obliged to withdraw. Wellington at\r\nonce raised the siege of San Sebastian, which had been carried on by\r\nSir Thomas Graham, and contented himself by blockading the fortress.\r\nHe immediately concentrated his right and centre at Sorauren, near\r\nPampeluna. The series of fights which took place at this time is known\r\nas the battles of the Pyrenees. On the 27th Wellington arrived, and\r\na rousing cheer greeted him, which it is said deterred the French\r\nfrom making anything but a partial attack. Probably the truth of the\r\nmatter is that Soult hesitated because he was expecting additional\r\nforces with d’Erlon, for the Marshal was scarcely likely to be overawed\r\nby a greeting. A corporal, unable to restrain his enthusiasm as the\r\nCommander-in-Chief rode along the line, shouted out to the intense\r\namusement of all, “There goes the little blackguard what whops the\r\nFrench!”[77]\r\n\r\nSoult was pointed out to the General by a spy. “Yonder,” Wellington\r\nis reported to have said, “is a great but cautious general; he will\r\ndelay his attack to know the reason of those cheers; that will give\r\ntime for my reinforcements to come up, and I shall beat him.” As a\r\nmatter of fact, the 6th Division of infantry, to which Wellington had\r\nreferred, did arrive, and “bludgeon work,” to use his expression, took\r\nplace on the 28th, the anniversary of Talavera. The reinforcements\r\nhad scarcely secured their position, their right resting on Orcain\r\nand their left on the heights overlooking the valley of the Lanz,\r\nthan a very determined attack was made by the enemy. They were driven\r\nback, and made an attempt on the hill occupied by the 7th caçadores\r\nand Ross’s brigade of the 4th Division. They obtained possession of\r\nit for a short time until driven down. When the battle became general\r\nthe 10th Portuguese regiment was overpowered, necessitating the\r\nwithdrawal of Ross. Wellington then ordered two regiments to charge\r\nthe enemy on the heights and those on the left, with the result that\r\nthe French were “driven down with immense loss.” “Every regiment,”\r\nsays Wellington, “charged with the bayonet, and the 40th, 7th, 20th,\r\nand 23rd, four different times.” Of Wellington’s 16,000 troops he lost\r\n2600 killed and wounded, the French 1800 out of 20,000. The Portuguese\r\nbehaved “admirably,” and the Commander-in-Chief “had every reason to\r\nbe satisfied with the conduct of the Spanish regiments El Principe and\r\nPravia.”\r\n\r\nBy sunset Soult’s attacks had waned, and on the following morning he\r\nbegan to retreat, although he received reinforcements to the number\r\nof 18,000 troops. On the 30th he attacked Hill to no good effect, and\r\nWellington forced the French to retire from a strong position they\r\nhad taken up. The pursuit continued until the 1st August, when it was\r\ndiscontinued, for the Allies were in possession of the passes and the\r\narduous exertion of the troops was beginning to tell upon them.\r\n\r\nWellington again took up his headquarters at Lesaca. Writing to Graham\r\nhe says, “I hope that Soult will not feel any inclination to renew\r\nhis expedition. The French army must have suffered greatly. Between\r\nthe 25th of last month and 2nd of this, they were engaged seriously\r\nnot less than ten times; on many occasions in attacking very strong\r\npositions, in others beat from them or pursued. I understand that\r\ntheir officers say that they have lost 15,000 men. I thought so; but\r\nas _they_ say so, I now think _more_. It is strange enough that our\r\ndiminution of strength to the 31st does not exceed 1500 men, although,\r\nI believe, our casualties are 6000.” It was on the 31st that San\r\nSebastian fell, the castle capitulating shortly afterwards, and the\r\nday is also noteworthy for Soult’s attack on San Marcial, which was\r\nrepulsed by Spanish troops, the enemy retiring across the Bidassoa.\r\nUnfortunately, Sir John Murray made no headway against Suchet in\r\nthe east of Spain, and was superseded by Lord William Bentinck, who\r\nbesieged Tarragona, which his predecessor had evacuated. Although he\r\nwas compelled to retire on the approach of the French Marshal, the city\r\nwas eventually occupied by the British troops. Their entry into Villa\r\nFranca was marred by the rout of the advanced guard in the pass of\r\nOrdal, necessitating their retreat towards Tarragona.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously impossible to unravel with any approach to detail the\r\ntangled skein of complicated manœuvres which took place at this period,\r\nperhaps the most trying and exacting of the war in the Peninsula.\r\nGleig, however, gives one picturesque touch to an involved picture\r\nwhich reveals more of the personality of the great General than many\r\npages of military movements, and is infinitely more valuable for\r\nthe purposes of a life story. “Lord Wellington,” he records, “after\r\ndirecting a Spanish column to move up a glen towards a specific point,\r\nlooked at his watch, and observed to those about him that it would\r\ntake the men so much time to perform the journey. He added that he was\r\ntired, and dismounting from his horse, wrapped himself in his cloak\r\nand went to sleep. A crowd of officers stood round him, and among\r\nothers some Spanish generals, whose astonishment at the coolness of\r\ntheir chief was expressed in audible whispers. For the very crisis of\r\nthe struggle was impending, and the French being in greater strength\r\nupon the spot, seemed to have the ball at their foot. Now, among the\r\nofficers of the headquarters’ staff, there were several who had never\r\napproved the passage of the Ebro. These began to speak their minds\r\nfreely, and one, the bravest of the brave, the gallant Colonel Gordon,\r\nexclaimed, ‘I always thought it would come to this. I was sure we\r\nshould make a mess of it, if we got entangled among the Pyrenees, and\r\nnow see if my words don’t come true.’ Lord Wellington happened to awake\r\njust as Gordon thus unburdened his conscience. He sat up, and without\r\naddressing himself to anyone in particular, extended his right hand\r\nopen, and said, as he closed it, ‘I have them all in my hand, just\r\nlike that.’ Not another word was spoken. The Spaniards had reached the\r\ntop of the glen; Lord Wellington and his attendants remounted their\r\nhorses, and the battle was renewed.”\r\n\r\nOn the 7th October 1813 Wellington passed the Bidassoa with the left\r\nof his army. Soult was attacked and driven back with the loss of eight\r\npieces of cannon, taken by the Allies in the captured redoubts and\r\nbatteries. The fighting was continued on the following day, after\r\nthe fog which obscured the enemy’s position had lifted, when a rock\r\noccupied by the French to the right of their position was carried “in\r\nthe most gallant style” by the Spaniards, who immediately afterwards\r\ndistinguished themselves by carrying an entrenchment on a hill which\r\nprotected the right of the camp of Sarre. Soult withdrew during the\r\nfollowing night, and took up a series of entrenched positions behind\r\nthe Nivelle, leaving, as Alison so eloquently puts it, “a vast hostile\r\narmy, for the first time since the Revolution, permanently encamped\r\nwithin the territory of France. And thus was England, which throughout\r\nthe contest had been the most persevering and resolute of all the\r\nopponents of the Revolution, and whose government had never yet either\r\nyielded to the victories or acknowledged the chiefs which it had placed\r\nat the head of affairs, the first of all the forces of Europe who\r\nsucceeded in planting its victorious standards on the soil of France.”\r\n\r\nOn the 10th November, a little over a week after the surrender of\r\nPampeluna through starvation, for the fall of which he had waited\r\nbefore resuming offensive operations, Wellington, with an army of\r\nabout 90,000 men, attacked the enemy’s position, an exceedingly strong\r\none, the right extending from the sea to St Jean de Luz, the left from\r\nBidarray to St Jean Pied de Port, the centre between Amotz and Ascain.\r\nThe enemy were driven out of the lines and followed over the river,\r\nwith a loss of 4200 men and no fewer than 51 guns, the Allies losing\r\nabout 2500 killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n“Our loss,” says Wellington, “although severe, has not been so great as\r\nmight have been expected, considering the strength of the positions\r\nattacked, and the length of time, from daylight in the morning till\r\nnight, during which the troops were engaged.” The disorders which\r\nfollowed the battle were so great that with the exception of a single\r\ndivision Wellington sent the whole of the Spaniards--some 25,000--back\r\nto the Peninsula.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th the Marshal was in the entrenched camp at Bayonne, and\r\nsix days later the victorious army went into cantonments, where it\r\nremained until the 9th December, when it was ordered to march towards\r\nBayonne. It forced the passage of the Nive, and a series of engagements\r\nwas fought until the 13th, on which date Hill, with one British and\r\none Portuguese division, fought and won the battle of Saint Pierre.\r\nWellington came up but refrained from interfering, and when he saw\r\nthat his brave colleague had proved victorious, he wrung his hand in a\r\nhearty grip and exclaimed, “Hill, the day is entirely your own.”\r\n\r\nIn the battles of the Nive the French lost 5800 killed and wounded,\r\nand three German regiments by desertion to the Allies, whose losses\r\ntotalled 4600. Soult had now one of two alternatives, either to be\r\nhemmed in at Bayonne or to retreat. He chose the latter, and marched\r\nin the direction of Toulouse with less than 40,000 troops, Napoleon,\r\nnow in desperate plight, having withdrawn 10,000 for the defence of the\r\neastern frontier of France.\r\n\r\nLeaving Sir John Hope to blockade Bayonne, Wellington followed Soult,\r\nwho took up a position at Orthez, on the right bank of the Gave de\r\nPau. Early on the morning of the 27th February the battle opened by\r\nBeresford turning the enemy’s right, but he was driven back, as was\r\nPicton, who attacked the enemy’s centre. “_Enfin je le tiens!_--At\r\nlast I have him!” exclaimed Soult, but Wellington changed his plan,\r\nand at once sent Hill to cross the river by the ford above Souars and\r\ncut off the Marshal’s retreat by the great road to Pau. At the same\r\ntime he ordered two divisions against the right of the enemy’s centre,\r\nand Colborne cut off the division which had checkmated Beresford. The\r\nFrench under Reille were driven from the heights, and at first retired,\r\nin good order, but Cotton and Lord Edward Somerset charged and spread\r\nconsiderable confusion in the ranks, while Hill marched on Aire and\r\nattacked Clausel. The Portuguese were repulsed, but the British drove\r\nthe enemy from the town with great loss.\r\n\r\nWellington was wounded almost at the end of the battle, which is\r\nperhaps one reason why the pursuit was not so rapid as it might\r\notherwise have been. However, Beresford was sent with two divisions to\r\nBordeaux, whose citizens bade them enter, and thereupon proclaimed the\r\nDuc d’Angoulême, eldest nephew of Louis XVIII, who was now with the\r\nBritish army, as Prince Regent.\r\n\r\nThe last battle of the Peninsular War was fought on Easter Sunday, the\r\n10th April 1814, at Toulouse, on which Soult’s army had concentrated.\r\n\r\nA mistake on the part of an engineer as to the breadth of the Garonne\r\nabove Toulouse prevented Wellington from crossing at the spot he had\r\nselected because there were not sufficient pontoons. This caused\r\nconsiderable delay and a march to a narrower but more difficult\r\nplace below the town. Sir George Napier says that he never saw the\r\nCommander-in-Chief in such a rage--he was “furious.” On the completion\r\nof the gangway, Beresford, with a portion of the army, passed over,\r\ndrove in the French outposts, and remained in front of the enemy. There\r\nthey stopped for three days, cut off from the main force and liable to\r\nattack any moment. This unexpected situation was brought about by a\r\nstorm which flooded the river and swept away the pontoons.\r\n\r\nSoult is stated to have given this reason for failing to assail\r\nBeresford’s force: “You do not know what stuff two British divisions\r\nare made of; they would not be conquered as long as there was a man of\r\nthem left to stand, and I cannot afford to lose men now.”\r\n\r\nWhen the new bridge was available no time was lost in crossing the\r\nriver, and on the 10th Soult was attacked. An eye-witness thus records\r\nthe event[78]:\r\n\r\n“The 4th, 6th, and a Portuguese division under Marshal Beresford’s\r\norders, attacked the great fort on the right of the French, and here\r\nwas the brunt of the battle, for the enemy was strongly posted and\r\nflanked by works, with trenches in their front, and their best troops\r\nopposed to ours. But nothing could damp the courage of this column; the\r\nenemy’s guns poured a torrent of fire upon it; still it moved onward,\r\nwhen column upon column appeared, crowning the hill and forming lines\r\nin front and on the flanks of our brave fellows who were near the\r\ntop; and then such a roll of musketry accompanied by peals of cannon\r\nand the shouts of the enemy commenced, that our soldiers were fairly\r\nforced to give way and were driven down again. This attack was twice\r\nrenewed, and twice were our gallant fellows forced to retire, when,\r\nbeing got into order again and under a tremendous fire of all arms from\r\nthe enemy, they once more marched onward determined ‘_to do or die_’\r\n(for they were nearly all Scotch) and, having gained the summit of the\r\nposition, they charged with the bayonet, and in spite of every effort\r\nof the enemy, drove all before them and entered every redoubt and fort\r\nwith such a courage as I never saw before. The enemy lay in _heaps_,\r\ndead and dying! few, very few, escaped the slaughter of that day; but\r\n‘victory’ was heard shouted from post to post as that gallant band\r\nmoved along the crown of the enemy’s position taking every work at the\r\npoint of the bayonet.\r\n\r\n“While the work of death was going on here, the centre of the French\r\nposition was attacked by the Spanish column of 8000 men, under\r\nGeneral Freyre, who had _demanded_ in rather a haughty tone that Lord\r\nWellington should give the Spaniards the post of honour in the battle.\r\nHe acceded, but took special care to have the Light Division in reserve\r\nto support them in case of _accidents_. Old Freyre placed himself at\r\nthe head of his column, surrounded by his staff, and marched boldly\r\nup the hollow way, or road, which led right up to the enemy, under a\r\nheavy and destructive fire of cannon shot, which plunging into the\r\nhead of his column made great havoc among his men; still they went\r\nsteadily and boldly on, to my astonishment and delight to see them\r\nbehave so gallantly, and I could not help expressing my delight to\r\nColonel Colborne. But, alas! he knew them too well, and said to me,\r\n‘Gently, my friend; don’t praise them too soon; look at yonder brigade\r\nof French Light Infantry, ready to attack them as soon as the head of\r\ntheir column enters the open ground. One moment more and we shall see\r\nthe Spaniards fly! Gallop off, you, and throw the 52nd Regiment (which\r\nwas in line) into open column of companies, and let these fellows\r\npass through, or they will carry the regiment off with them.’ He had\r\nscarcely finished the words when a well-directed fire from the French\r\nInfantry opened upon the Spanish column, and instantly the words ‘_Vive\r\nl’Empereur! En avant! en avant!_’ accompanied by a charge, put the\r\nSpaniards to flight, and down they came upon the 52nd Regiment, and I\r\nhad but just time to throw it into open column of companies when they\r\nrushed through the intervals like a torrent and never stopped till\r\nthey arrived at the river some miles in the rear. As soon as they had\r\npassed, and I had formed the regiment into line again, we moved up and\r\ntook the Spaniards’ place, driving before us the enemy’s brigade, who,\r\nbeing by this time completely beaten on the right and all his forts and\r\ntrenches carried by Beresford’s troops, had retreated into the town; so\r\nthat we found the fort on that part of the position which we attacked\r\nquite abandoned, and we entered it without loss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The French Retreat over the Pyrenees\r\n\r\nR. Caton Woodville]\r\n\r\n“On our right the 3rd Division, under General Picton, was ordered to\r\nmake a false attack on the canal bridge, which was strongly fortified\r\nand formed an impracticable barrier to that part of the town; but\r\nGeneral Picton (who never hesitated at disobeying his orders)\r\nthought proper to change this false attack into a real one, and after\r\nrepeated and useless attempts to carry it was forced to give it up,\r\nwith an immense loss of officers and men. To our extreme right and on\r\nthe opposite side of the river General Hill was stationed with his\r\ncorps in order to watch the bridge and gates of the town, and either\r\nprevent any attempt of the enemy to pass over a body of troops during\r\nthe action to cut off our communications with the rear, or, should he\r\nshow any design of retreating that way, to impede him. However, all was\r\nquiet on that side, and now that every man of the enemy’s army had been\r\nchased from the position the battle was won, and the roar of cannon,\r\nthe fire of the musketry, and the shouts of the victors ceased. All was\r\nstill; the pickets placed; the sentinels set; and the greatest part of\r\nthe army sleeping in groups round the fires of the bivouac.”\r\n\r\nSoult had only been able to bring some 39,000 men into the field, to\r\nso great an extent had his forces been depleted, while Wellington had\r\nless than 50,000 available troops. Of the French, 3200 were killed\r\nor wounded, of the Allies 4600. On the 12th April Soult evacuated\r\nToulouse, six days after Napoleon the Great had snatched up a pen and\r\nscrawled his formal abdication. A moment before he had been full of\r\nfight, had wanted to rally the corps of Augereau, Suchet and Soult. A\r\nyear later he won back more than these. Wellington entered Toulouse\r\non the day Soult left it, and within a few hours of the receipt of\r\nthe news from Paris of the proclamation of Louis XVIII, a monarch as\r\nincompetent as the fallen Emperor was great. History is oftentimes\r\nironic, and Time’s see-saw seldom maintains an even balance for any\r\nlengthy period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nThe Prelude to the Waterloo Campaign\r\n\r\n(1814-15)\r\n\r\n  “_I work as hard as I can in every way in order to succeed._”\r\n\r\n            WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I march to-morrow to follow Marshal Soult, and to prevent his army\r\nfrom becoming the _noyau_ of a civil war in France.” Thus writes\r\nWellington to Sir John Hope on the 16th April 1814, when the white flag\r\nof the Bourbons was flying at Toulouse, and forty-eight hours after\r\nHope had been made a prisoner during a sortie on the part of the French\r\ngarrison of Bayonne. Soult extended no right hand of welcome to Louis\r\nXVIII, and positively refused to submit to the new _regime_ until he\r\nhad received trustworthy information from some of Napoleon’s ministers.\r\nHowever, he was speedily convinced of the fall of his former master,\r\nand both he and Suchet acknowledged the Provisional Government. On the\r\n19th April a Convention was signed by each party and Wellington for\r\nthe cessation of hostilities and the evacuation of Spain. The British\r\ninfantry were sent either to the homeland or on foreign service; the\r\ncavalry traversed France and crossed to England from Calais.\r\n\r\nWellington’s work was not yet over, although his military career was\r\nclosed for a time. He was appointed British Ambassador at Paris, and\r\nwhile he wrote to a correspondent that recent political and military\r\nevents promised “to restore the blessings of peace permanently to\r\nthe world,” we must not suppose that he believed the abdication of\r\nNapoleon to be the herald of the millennium. When Castlereagh proposed\r\nthe diplomatic post to him Wellington would have been perfectly\r\njustified in declining it, but sufficient of his story has been told\r\nfor the reader to appreciate the fact that the Hero of the Peninsula\r\nwas as keenly devoted to the service of his king and country as the\r\nHero of Trafalgar. Whatever egotism he possessed was certainly not\r\ncarried to excess. He says that he should never have thought himself\r\nqualified for the work. “I hope, however,” he adds, and here the\r\nsterling qualities of the man are revealed, “that the Prince Regent,\r\nhis Government, and your Lordship, are convinced that I am ready to\r\nserve him in any situation in which it may be thought that I can be of\r\nany service. Although I have been so long absent from England, I should\r\nhave remained as much longer if it had been necessary; and I feel no\r\nobjection to another absence in the public service, if it be necessary\r\nor desirable.” He says much the same thing to his brother Henry: “I\r\nmust serve the public in some manner or other; and, as under existing\r\ncircumstances I could not well do so at home, I must do so abroad.”\r\n\r\nThose who accuse Wellington of lack of heart will do well to remember\r\nthat before leaving Toulouse for Paris he wrote an appealing letter to\r\nEarl Bathurst in behalf of Sir Rowland Hill and Sir Robert Kennedy, the\r\nlatter of whom had exerted himself to the utmost in keeping the army\r\nwell supplied with provisions, and to write a letter of condolence to\r\nHope, who was a prisoner and wounded.\r\n\r\nBut he found time to join in a few _fêtes_ in honour of the\r\nRestoration, including a magnificent ball given by Sir Charles Stewart,\r\nthe British Commissioner to the Army of the Allies, where monarchs were\r\nplentiful and Society beauties abundant. “It was in the midst of this\r\nball,” the Comtesse de Boigne relates, “that the Duke of Wellington\r\nappeared for the first time in Paris. I can see him now entering the\r\nroom with his two nieces, Lady Burgers[79] and Miss Pole, hanging on\r\nhis arms. There were no eyes for any one else, and at this ball, where\r\ngrandeur abounded, everything gave way to military glory. That of the\r\nDuke of Wellington was brilliant and unalloyed, and a lustre was added\r\nto it by the interest that had long been felt in the cause of the\r\nSpanish nation.”\r\n\r\nHe had only been in Paris six days before he set out for Madrid, viâ\r\nToulouse, “in order to try whether I cannot prevail upon all parties\r\nto be more moderate, and to adopt a constitution more likely to be\r\npracticable and to contribute to the peace and happiness of the\r\nnation.” He had made the proposal, and the Allies had eagerly accepted\r\nit. When he started on his journey he was the Duke of Wellington,[80]\r\nand it was additional cause of satisfaction to him to know that\r\npeerages had been conferred on Beresford, Hill, Cotton, Hope, and\r\nGraham, “my gallant coadjutors.” He stayed at Toulouse for a couple of\r\ndays, attending to details connected with the army, and again continued\r\nhis journey, writing dispatches, notes of condolence, a letter\r\nrequesting permission to accept the Grand Cross of the Order of St\r\nGeorge from the Czar, and so on.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had released Ferdinand VII on the 13th of the previous\r\nMarch, and the king was now back in his capital. “I entertain a\r\nvery favourable opinion of the King from what I have seen of him,”\r\nWellington writes from Madrid on the 25th May 1814, “but not of his\r\nMinisters.” This opinion of Ferdinand must be taken as referring to\r\nthe man and not to his methods, for he had already assumed the part\r\nof a despot to so alarming an extent that civil war was feared, hence\r\nthe Duke’s journey. “I have accomplished my object in coming here”; he\r\nsays in the same letter, “that is, I think there will certainly be\r\nno civil war at present.” But seven days later he communicates with\r\nCastlereagh in a minor key: “I have been well received by the King and\r\nhis Ministers; but I fear that I have done but little good.”\r\n\r\nHe left a lengthy memorandum in the hands of his Catholic Majesty,\r\nfull of excellent advice, and bereft, as he said, of “all national\r\npartialities and prejudices.” Commerce, the colonies, domestic\r\ninterests, and finance are all touched upon in a sane, straightforward\r\nway, obviously with the intention of promoting “a good understanding\r\nand cementing the alliance with Great Britain,” but valuable quite\r\napart from any motive that might be construed as selfish. As Wellington\r\nsays in the preamble, “The Spanish nation having been engaged for six\r\nyears in one of the most terrible and disastrous contests by which any\r\nnation was ever afflicted, its territory having been entirely occupied\r\nby the enemy, the country torn to pieces by internal divisions,\r\nits ancient constitution having been destroyed, and vain attempts\r\nmade to establish a new one; its marine, its commerce, and revenue\r\nentirely annihilated; its colonies in a state of rebellion, and\r\nnearly lost to the mother country; it becomes a question for serious\r\nconsideration, what line of policy should be adopted by His Majesty\r\nupon his happy restoration to his throne and authority.” Had Ferdinand\r\ntaken Wellington’s well-intentioned advice to heart, Spain might have\r\nrisen from her ashes. The old abuses cropped up, the Inquisition was\r\nre-established in a milder form, and troops were sent across the seas\r\nto perish in a futile endeavour to recover the Transatlantic colonies\r\nof a once glorious empire.\r\n\r\nAfter returning to Paris to make arrangements for the embarkation of\r\nthe British cavalry at Calais, the Duke sailed for England. When he\r\nlanded at Dover on the 23rd June 1814, a salute from the batteries of\r\nthe Castle welcomed him home. “About five o’clock this morning,” says\r\na contemporary writer, “his majesty’s sloop-of-war, the _Rosario_,\r\narrived in the roads, and fired a salute. Shortly afterwards, the\r\nyards of the different vessels of war were manned; a salute took place\r\nthroughout the squadron, and the launch of the _Nymphen_ frigate was\r\nseen advancing towards the harbour, with the Duke of Wellington; at\r\nthis time the guns upon the heights and from the batteries commenced\r\ntheir thunder upon the boat leaving the ship; and on passing the\r\npier-heads his Lordship was greeted with three distinct rounds of\r\ncheers from those assembled; but upon his landing at the Crosswall,\r\nnothing could exceed the rapture with which his Lordship was received\r\nby at least ten thousand persons; and notwithstanding it was so early,\r\nparties continued to arrive from town and country every minute. The\r\ninstant his Lordship set foot on shore, a proposition was made, and\r\ninstantly adopted, to carry him to the Ship Inn: he was borne on\r\nthe shoulders of our townsmen, amidst the reiterated cheers of the\r\npopulace.”\r\n\r\nLondon went wild with excitement when he arrived, and at Westminster\r\nBridge the mob took the horses from his carriage and dragged it along\r\nin triumph. On the 28th he took his seat for the first time in the\r\nHouse of Lords. He must have appeared a fine figure as, clad in his\r\nField Marshal’s uniform under a peer’s robes, he was introduced by\r\nthe Dukes of Beaufort and Richmond. The Lord Chancellor expressed\r\nthe sentiments of the House, but refrained from attempting to state\r\nthe “eminent merits” of his military character, “to represent those\r\nbrilliant actions, those illustrious achievements, which have attached\r\nimmortality to the name of Wellington, and which have given to this\r\ncountry a degree of glory unexampled in the annals of this kingdom. In\r\nthus acting, I believe I best consult the feelings which evince your\r\nGrace’s title to the character of a truly great and illustrious man”;\r\nand the Duke replied, in a short speech, attributing his success to his\r\ntroops and general officers. A little later a deputation from the Lower\r\nHouse waited upon Wellington to offer him the congratulations of the\r\nCommons, and he attended in person to return thanks. The whole House\r\nrose as he entered. After a short speech the Speaker made an eloquent\r\nand touching address.\r\n\r\n“It is not ... the grandeur of military success,” he said, “which has\r\nalone fixed our admiration or commanded our applause; it has been that\r\ngenerous and lofty spirit which inspired your troops with unbounded\r\nconfidence, and taught them to know that the day of battle was always\r\na day of victory; that moral courage and enduring fortitude which, in\r\nperilous times, when gloom and doubt had beset ordinary minds, stood\r\nnevertheless unshaken; and that ascendancy of character which, uniting\r\nthe energies of jealous and rival nations, enabled you to wield at will\r\nthe fate and fortunes of mighty empires....\r\n\r\n“It now remains only that we congratulate your Grace upon the high and\r\nimportant mission on which you are about to proceed, and we doubt not\r\nthat the same splendid talents, so conspicuous in war, will maintain,\r\nwith equal authority, firmness, and temper, our national honour and\r\ninterests in peace.”\r\n\r\nWellington was made a Doctor of Laws by the University of Oxford, as\r\nNelson had been before him,[81] he received the freedom of the City of\r\nLondon in a gold casket, and a magnificent sword--in a word, he was the\r\ncountry’s Hero.\r\n\r\nThe time at his disposal was short and fully occupied, for he\r\nleft London on the 8th August for Paris, travelling by way of the\r\nNetherlands, where he inspected the frontier from Liège along the\r\nMeuse and the Sambre to Namur and Charleroi, and thence by Mons to\r\nTournay and the sea with a view to determining how Holland and Belgium,\r\nnow united into one kingdom, could be placed in an adequate state of\r\ndefence for future service should circumstances dictate. He also noted\r\nsome of the most advantageous positions, including “the entrance of\r\nthe _forêt_ de Soignes by the high road which leads to Brussels from\r\nBinch, Charleroi, and Namur,”--in one word, Waterloo. He realized\r\nthat there were more disadvantages than advantages, but “this country\r\nmust be defended in the best manner that is possible,” even though it\r\n“affords no features upon which reliance can be placed to establish any\r\ndefensive system.”[82]\r\n\r\nWellington had no hours of luxurious ease in Paris. The abolition\r\nof the slave trade, on which Great Britain had at last determined,\r\noccupied much of his attention, and one has only to refer to his\r\ndispatches at this period to understand the many difficulties he had\r\nto contend with in this one particular. Then there were questions of\r\ncompensation for private property destroyed or damaged in the late war\r\nto be considered, of American vessels of war and privateers fitted\r\nout in French ports, and what was most important of all, a diagnosis\r\nof the increasing restlessness in Paris to be made. He believed that\r\nthe sentiments of the people were favourable to the Bourbon king, “but\r\nthe danger is not in that quarter, but among the discontented officers\r\nof the army, and others, heretofore in the civil departments of the\r\nservice, now without employment.”\r\n\r\nIt would be incorrect to state that Wellington was popular in Paris,\r\nfor not a few prominent military men regarded the presence of the\r\nGeneral who had played no small part in tarnishing the glory of France\r\nas a perpetual reminder of the country’s misfortunes. The people even\r\nwent so far as to resent his coat of arms, in which there was a lion or\r\nleopard bearing a tricoloured flag. This was construed as the British\r\nlion trampling on the French national flag. There was an eagle on the\r\nDuchess’s arms, which was another cause of offence. “My coach was in\r\ndanger of being torn to pieces,” says the Duke, and he was obliged to\r\nhave the innocent bird painted out.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of Vienna was now sitting, bent on undoing the work of\r\nthe Revolution so far as was possible with a view to upholding the\r\nDivine right of kings. This is not to be wondered at considering the\r\nmembers of the solemn conclave, which included the Czar, the Kings\r\nof Prussia, Bavaria, Denmark and Würtemberg, the Grand Duke Charles\r\nof Baden, the Elector William of Hesse, the Hereditary Grand Duke\r\nGeorge of Hesse-Darmstadt, the Duke of Weimar, and Prince Eugene\r\nBeauharnais (Napoleon’s step-son). The President was Metternich, the\r\nEmperor of Austria’s right-hand man, the first representative of\r\nFrance was the wily Talleyrand, of Great Britain Castlereagh. A host\r\nof plenipotentiaries came to put their fingers into the political\r\npie, including those of Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Norway, France,\r\nGreat Britain, Prussia, Russia, Switzerland, Italy, the Pope, the\r\nNetherlands, and the smaller German States.\r\n\r\nWhat with talk of projected attempts on his life and the far from\r\npacific doings at Vienna, the Earl of Liverpool was of opinion that it\r\nwould be advisable to get Wellington out of France as soon as possible.\r\nWith this idea in view he was offered the command of the troops in\r\nNorth America, an offer he bitterly resented. However, Castlereagh\r\nsolved the difficulty by asking the Duke to take his place at Vienna.\r\nThe proposition was made by the Foreign Secretary in a letter dated\r\nthe 18th December 1814. “I do not hesitate to comply with your\r\ndesire,” the Duke replies. “As I mean to serve the King’s Government\r\nin any situation which may be thought desirable, it is a matter of\r\nindifference to me in what stage I find your proceedings.”\r\n\r\nWhen Wellington reached the Austrian capital in January 1815--destined\r\nto be the greatest year in modern European history--he found that the\r\nwolves in sheep’s clothing had almost concluded their deliberations.\r\nRussia, supported by Prussia, was intent upon securing Poland, a plan\r\nbitterly opposed by Great Britain and Austria. France was wishful for\r\nHolland and Belgium. The quarrelling suddenly ceased when, on the 7th\r\nMarch, Metternich received the most astounding news. Napoleon, King of\r\nElba, had left his little island state, landed on the French coast, and\r\nwas marching in the direction of Paris! Wellington heard on the same\r\nday from another source, and immediately communicated the scanty news\r\ndetailed to him by Lord Burghersh to the Emperor of Austria and the\r\nCzar.\r\n\r\n“I do not entertain the smallest doubt that, if unfortunately it\r\nshould be possible for Buonaparte to hold at all against the King\r\nof France, he must fall under the cordially united efforts of the\r\nSovereigns of Europe.” Thus writes the Duke to Castlereagh, but in a\r\ndispatch of the same date, namely the 12th March, he shows that he\r\nentirely failed to appreciate the fascination still exercised by the\r\nname “Napoleon.” “It is my opinion,” he writes, “that Buonaparte has\r\nacted upon false or no information, and that the King will destroy him\r\nwithout difficulty, and in a short time.” We know that the ex-Emperor’s\r\nreception was at first somewhat lukewarm, but as he marched towards the\r\ncapital it assumed the form of a triumphal procession, with Ney and the\r\n6000 men who were “to bring him back in an iron cage” as enthusiastic\r\nfollowers. The inhabitants of the south alone refused to recognize the\r\nformer Emperor of the French.\r\n\r\nFar from Louis XVIII destroying Napoleon “without difficulty,” that\r\nbrave monarch left France to its own devices on the 19th March, the\r\nday before his predecessor and successor reached the Tuileries. “What\r\ndid he do in the midst of the general consternation of Paris?” asks\r\nthe Baron de Frénilly. “He acted. A great crowd saw him in the morning\r\nproceeding in pomp with Monsieur to the Chamber of Deputies; he was\r\nseen to enter and throw himself into his brother’s arms, with the\r\nsolemn promise to remain in Paris and be buried under the ruins of the\r\nmonarchy; and on the following day the population learnt that he had\r\nfled in the night by the road to Flanders!” Soult, now Minister of\r\nWar, apparently under the impression that an Army Order would tend to\r\ndispel any affection the soldiers might feel towards their former Head,\r\nissued the most stupid of nonsensical proclamations. “Bonaparte,” it\r\nreads in part, “mistakes us so far as to believe that we are capable\r\nof abandoning a legitimate and beloved sovereign in order to share the\r\nfortunes of one who is nothing more than an adventurer. He believes\r\nthis--the idiot!--and his last act of folly is a convincing proof that\r\nhe does so.”\r\n\r\nWithout loss of time the Fifth Coalition was formed, Great Britain,\r\nRussia, Austria and Prussia entering into a treaty on the 17th March,\r\nwhereby each of them guaranteed to put 150,000 men in the field against\r\n“the enemy and disturber of the peace of the world,” Great Britain,\r\nas usual, financing the Allies, this time to the enormous extent of\r\n£5,000,000.\r\n\r\nWith commendable dispatch Napoleon formed a new ministry and began to\r\nmarshal his troops, which at first numbered 200,000 and eventually\r\n284,000, excluding a quarter of a million of men for internal defence.\r\n“It was the finest army,” writes Professor Oman, “that Napoleon had\r\ncommanded since Friedland, for it was purely French, and was composed\r\nalmost entirely of veterans; but it was too small for its purpose.”[83]\r\nMurat, king of Naples, precipitated matters by invading the Papal\r\nStates, and failed at the hands of Austria, thereby robbing his\r\nbrother-in-law of his only possible ally. But this was finished by the\r\nbeginning of May, over a month before Napoleon started for the front,\r\nleaving 10,000 of his none-too-numerous troops to quell an outburst of\r\nroyalist enthusiasm in La Vendée, ever the most warlike province of\r\nFrance and apt to flame into insurrection on the slightest provocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nLigny and Quatre Bras\r\n\r\n(1815)\r\n\r\n  “_I go to measure myself with Wellington._”\r\n\r\n            NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\n\r\nNapoleon left Paris at dawn on the 12th June, and travelled to Laon.\r\nHis troops were divided into the Army of the North, intended for the\r\ninvasion of Belgium, which totalled a little over 124,000; the Army\r\nof the Rhine, commanded by Rapp, about 20,000, with a reserve of\r\n3000 National Guards; Le Courbe’s corps of observation, watching the\r\npasses of the Jura, about 8000; the Army of the Alps, with Suchet,\r\nsome 23,000; a detachment, under Brune, guarding the line of the\r\nVar, 6000; the 7th Corps, watching the line of the Pyrenees, 14,000,\r\nin two sections under Decaen and Clausel. The Army of the North was\r\ndistributed at Lille, Valenciennes, Mézières, Thionville, and Soissons,\r\nunder D’Erlon, Reille, Vandamme, Gérard and Lobau respectively; the\r\nImperial Guard near Paris, and the Reserve Cavalry, under Grouchy,\r\nbetween the Aisne and the Sambre.[84] Soult was chief of the staff, an\r\nappointment not particularly happy.[85]\r\n\r\nIn Belgium there was the nucleus of an army, consisting of some 10,000\r\nsoldiers, mostly British. Wellington arrived at Brussels on the 5th\r\nApril, with the formidable task in hand of organizing a substantial\r\nbody to oppose the returned Exile. He managed it, but the result was\r\nalmost as motley a crowd of fighting men as Napoleon had for his\r\ndisastrous Russian campaign. Wellington bluntly called them “not only\r\nthe worst troops, but the worst-equipped army, with the worst staff\r\nthat was ever brought together.” There were Hanoverians, Belgians,\r\nDutch, Brunswickers, and Nassauers, as well as men of his own country.\r\nThe 1st Corps, under the Prince of Orange, totalled 25,000, with\r\nheadquarters at Braine-le-Comte; the 2nd Corps, commanded by Lord Hill,\r\nnumbered 24,000, with headquarters at Ath; the Reserve Corps, with the\r\nDuke at Brussels, 21,000; the Cavalry, under the Earl of Uxbridge,\r\n14,000; in the garrisons were 12,000, and the artillery and engineers\r\nreached 10,000--grand total 106,000.[86] The Prussian Army, commanded\r\nby Blücher, reached 124,000 men, some few thousands of whom were\r\nalready in Belgium in March. It was made up of four corps stationed\r\nat Charleroi, Namur, Ciney, and Liége, with headquarters at Namur.\r\nBoth armies were in touch with each other, although distributed over\r\na large extent of territory. It was intended that 750,000 men should\r\nbe available for the invasion of France, but none of the other allies\r\nwas ready. Napoleon acted promptly, his idea being to deal with each\r\nseparately and drive them back on their bases before they were able to\r\nconcentrate. He would then turn on the Austrians before the Russians\r\nwere ready.\r\n\r\nNapoleon succeeded in concentrating the Army of the North without\r\ndefinite particulars of his movements reaching either Wellington or\r\nBlücher. On the 15th June he was across the frontier and had made a\r\npreliminary success by driving Ziethen, who commanded Blücher’s first\r\ncorps, from the banks of the Sambre, gaining the bridges, and securing\r\nCharleroi. The Emperor followed the Prussians to within a short\r\ndistance of Gilly, where the French right wing defeated them with the\r\nloss of nearly 2000 men. The enemy then fell back in the direction of\r\nLigny, and Napoleon made his headquarters at Charleroi. Meanwhile Ney,\r\nwho had only arrived in the afternoon, was given charge of Reille’s\r\nand D’Erlon’s corps, and it is usually contended that he had told\r\nLefebvre-Desnoëttes to reconnoitre towards Quatre Bras, then held by\r\nsome 4500 Nassau troops, commanded by Prince Bernard of Saxe-Weimar.\r\n\r\nLefebvre first encountered the enemy at the village of Frasnes, some\r\ntwenty-three miles from Brussels and covering Quatre Bras, where about\r\n1500 men were stationed, who fell back towards Quatre Bras. The French\r\nGeneral occupied the village in the evening after an indecisive action.\r\n\r\nWhen information reached Wellington from Ziethen, vague because it was\r\ndispatched early in the morning, he ordered the majority of the troops\r\nat his disposal to be “ready to move at the shortest notice,” and a few\r\nonly were told to change the positions they then occupied. He issued\r\nhis final instructions at 10 p.m., and then went to the ball given by\r\nthe Duchess of Richmond, who had invited some of the non-commissioned\r\nofficers and privates in order “to show her Bruxelles friends the\r\n_real Highland dance_,” as Wellington afterwards averred. The\r\nCommander-in-Chief was quite easy in his mind, for he had done all that\r\nit was possible for him to do, and his appearance at such a festivity\r\ntended to allay the anxiety of the inhabitants as to Napoleon’s\r\nmovements. Surely the capital was safe if Wellington was so unconcerned\r\nas to go to a dance?\r\n\r\n    _There was a sound of Revelry by night;\r\n    And Belgium’s Capital had gather’d then\r\n    Her Beauty and her Chivalry; and bright\r\n    The lamps shone o’er fair women, and brave men:\r\n        A thousand hearts beat happily; and when\r\n        Music arose with its voluptuous swell,\r\n        Soft eyes look’d love to eyes which spake again;\r\n        And all went merry as a marriage-bell:\r\n    But Hush! Hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!_\r\n\r\n        _Did ye not hear it? No: ’twas but the wind;\r\n        Or the car rattling o’er the stony street:\r\n        On with the dance! let Joy be unconfined:\r\n        No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet\r\n        To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet:\r\n        But, Hark! that heavy sound breaks in once more;\r\n        As if the clouds its echo would repeat;\r\n        And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!\r\n    Arm! Arm! it is; it is; the Cannon’s opening Roar!_\r\n\r\nHad Byron pictured the entry of Lieutenant Webster with a dispatch\r\nfor the Prince of Orange he would have been more literally, if not\r\nartistically, correct. The nineteen words which the Prince read were\r\nmomentous: “Captain Baron von Gagern has just arrived from Nivelles,\r\nreporting that the enemy had pushed up to Quatre Bras.” It had been\r\nwritten at Braine-le-Comte at 10.30 p.m. No further instructions were\r\nissued by Wellington, for he had already arranged “for a movement\r\ntending to draw the right of his forces in towards the left.”[87] He\r\ntherefore remained at the ball until about 2 a.m., on the 16th, and\r\nthen went to bed.\r\n\r\nHe left the city very early and arrived at Quatre Bras about 10\r\no’clock. There he found, according to his own statement,[88] “the\r\nPrince of Orange with a small body of Belgian troops, two or three\r\nbattalions of infantry, a squadron of Belgian dragoons, and two or\r\nthree pieces of cannon which had been at the Quatre Bras--the four\r\nroads--since the preceding evening. It appeared that the picket of this\r\ndetachment had been touched by a French patrol, and there was some\r\nfiring, but very little; and of so little importance that, after seeing\r\nwhat was doing, I went on to the Prussian army, which I saw from the\r\nground, was assembling upon the field of St Amand and Ligny, about\r\neight miles distant.\r\n\r\n“I reached the Prussian army; was at their headquarters; stayed there a\r\nconsiderable time; saw the army formed; the commencement of the battle;\r\nand returned to join my own army assembled and assembling at the Quatre\r\nBras. I arrived then at Quatre Bras a second time on that day, as well\r\nas I recollect, at about two or three o’clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n“The straggling fire there had continued from morning; the Prince of\r\nOrange was with the line troops still in the same position. I was\r\ninformed that the army was collecting in a wood in front. I rode\r\nforward and reconnoitred or examined their position according to my\r\nusual practice. I saw clearly a very large body of men assembled, and a\r\nMaréchal reviewing them, according to their usual practice, preparatory\r\nto an attack. I heard distinctly the usual cries: ‘_En avant! en avant!\r\nL’Empereur récompensera celui qui s’avancera!_’\r\n\r\n“Before I quitted the Prince of Orange, some of the officers standing\r\nabout had doubted whether we should be attacked at this point. I sent\r\nto the Prince of Orange from the ground on which I was standing, to\r\ntell him that he might rely upon it that we should be attacked in five\r\nminutes, and that he had better order the retreat towards the main\r\nposition of the light troops and guns which were in front, and which\r\ncould make no resistance to the fierce attack about to be made upon\r\nus. These were accordingly withdrawn, and in less than five minutes we\r\nwere attacked by the whole French army under Maréchal Ney. There was\r\nin fact no delay nor cessation from attack from that time till night.\r\nThe reserves of the British army from Brussels had arrived at the\r\nQuatre Bras at this time; and the corps of Brunswick troops from the\r\nheadquarters, and a division of Belgian troops from Nivelles, Braine,\r\n&c.”\r\n\r\nNey did not begin his attack until 2 p.m. He had only Reille’s\r\ncorps at his disposal, and he was uncertain as to the movements\r\nof the Prussians. But when a move was made against the farm of\r\nGémioncourt,[89] the key of the position, the 7000 troops of the Prince\r\nof Orange were speedily driven back, and the wood of Bossu also fell\r\ninto the enemy’s hands. It was at this precise moment that Wellington\r\nand reinforcements arrived. Picton with his brave 5th Division,\r\nalthough exhausted by a long march on a sultry day, were ordered to\r\nretake the wood. It was then that Ney hurled his cavalry at them in a\r\ndetermined endeavour to save the situation at all costs.\r\n\r\n“One regiment,” we are told, “after sustaining a furious cannonade,\r\nwas suddenly, and on three different sides, assailed by cavalry. Two\r\nfaces of the square were charged by the lancers, while the cuirassiers\r\ngalloped down upon another. It was a trying moment. There was a\r\ndeath-like silence, and one voice alone, calm and clear, was heard. It\r\nwas their Colonel’s, who called upon them to be ‘steady.’ On came the\r\nenemy--the earth shook beneath the horses’ feet; while on every side of\r\nthe devoted band, the corn,[90] bending beneath the rush of cavalry,\r\ndisclosed their numerous assailants. The lance-blades approached the\r\nbayonets of the kneeling front rank--the cuirassiers were within forty\r\npaces--yet not a trigger was drawn. But when the word ‘Fire!’ thundered\r\nfrom the colonel’s lips, each piece poured out its deadly volley, and\r\nin a moment the leading files of the French lay before the square, as\r\nif hurled by a thunderbolt to the earth. The assailants, broken and\r\ndispersed, galloped off for shelter to the tall rye; while a stream\r\nof musketry from the British square carried death into the retreating\r\nsquadrons.” At length Maitland’s division of the Guards secured\r\npossession of the wood. The French continued to attack with ardour,\r\nbut with the close of day Ney fell back upon the road to Frasnes. The\r\nBritish remained at Quatre Bras.\r\n\r\nMany brave incidents are recorded. A soldier of the 92nd was wounded\r\nin the thigh. After having been attended by a surgeon the medical man\r\ndismissed him by saying, “There is now no fear of you, get slowly\r\nbehind.” His reply, unpremeditated and instant, was, “The presence of\r\nevery man is necessary,” and calmly went back to his post, from which\r\nhe never returned. Another fellow had his knapsack carried away from\r\nhis shoulders by a cannon-ball. He caught it by a dexterous movement\r\nbefore it reached the ground. Wellington happened to be near, and the\r\nincident afforded him considerable amusement.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd Battalion of the 69th Regiment of Foot[91] had its flag\r\ncaptured, the precious symbol being wrenched from the hands of the\r\nofficer almost at the same time as the attempted capture of another\r\ncolour during a charge of French cuirassiers. The latter was preserved,\r\nalthough the bearer received severe wounds. Ensign Christie also saved\r\na flag by throwing himself upon it. As the soldier lay on the ground\r\na portion of the colour was torn off by the lancer who had made the\r\nattempt, but before the prize could be taken the captor was shot and\r\nthe piece recovered.\r\n\r\nWellington lost 4600 killed and wounded at Quatre Bras, but although\r\nhe remained in possession of the field, Ney’s grim determination had\r\nprecluded him from sending reinforcements to Blücher, who had been\r\ncontesting Napoleon at Ligny, eight miles distant. On the other hand,\r\nthe Emperor had ordered his Marshal to assist him at Ligny after having\r\ndispersed the troops at Quatre Bras, which he was far too heavily\r\nengaged all day to do, although it is conceivable that had he begun\r\nhis attack earlier he might have carried out his Chief’s instructions.\r\nNapoleon himself delayed his attack because some of his soldiers had\r\nnot arrived, and when he was ready to open fire he totalled 20,000\r\nmen less than the Prussian commander. D’Erlon’s troops, forming Ney’s\r\nreserve, were sent for, but before they were pressed into service were\r\nordered back by Ney to assist him. Had D’Erlon remained, Napoleon would\r\nhave won a decisive victory. As it was, Blücher’s losses reached over\r\n20,000, and he narrowly averted capture. He was thrown during a cavalry\r\ncharge and badly injured. The Prussians abandoned the field, retiring\r\ntowards Wavre, which enabled them to be in touch with Wellington, and\r\nwhere they later formed a junction with the fresh corps of Bülow.\r\nNapoleon, who had 11,000 men killed or wounded, was convinced that the\r\nenemy would fall back on Namur and Liége, which would enable him to\r\ndeal with Wellington alone on the morrow.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was unusually lethargic on the following day, and squandered\r\nmuch precious time until noon in various useless ways. He then ordered\r\nGrouchy, with 33,000 men, to ascertain the position occupied by the\r\nPrussians, while he joined Ney. Wellington, hearing of Blücher’s defeat\r\nand realizing that every moment was of value, had evacuated Quatre\r\nBras almost without interference, although Napoleon’s cavalry came\r\nup with the British rear and the situation was saved by a propitious\r\ndownpour of rain which soon transformed road and field alike into a\r\nquagmire. Still, Napoleon chased in pursuit to the ridge of Waterloo,\r\nwhere a heavy cannonade put an end to his advance. The Emperor made his\r\nheadquarters at the Caillou farm, retiring to rest only after he had\r\nseen that Wellington’s army was not retreating from the position it had\r\ntaken up at Mont St Jean. Unable to sleep, he again satisfied himself\r\nthat the army he was bent on shattering had not stolen a march on him,\r\nand when the 18th June dawned he was still gazing in the direction of\r\nWellington and his men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nWaterloo\r\n\r\n(1815)\r\n\r\n  “_The history of a battle is not unlike the history of a ball. Some\r\n  individuals may recollect all the little events of which the great\r\n  result is the battle lost or won; but no individual can recollect\r\n  the order in which, or the exact moment at which they occurred,\r\n  which makes all the difference as to their value or importance._”\r\n\r\n            WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British General had already sent word to Blücher that he was\r\nprepared to fight Napoleon if the Prussian Commander could see his\r\nway to send him one army-corps, the assistance of which he deemed\r\nimperative. He did not receive a reply until the early hours of the\r\n18th, and it was in the affirmative. He promised Bülow’s corps, which\r\nwould march at daybreak against Napoleon’s right, followed by that of\r\nPirch. Those of Thielmann and Ziethen would also be sent provided the\r\npresence of Grouchy did not prevent. As events turned out, Thielmann’s\r\ncorps was sufficient for this purpose of defending the Dyle against\r\nthe French Marshal. The first report from Grouchy received by Napoleon\r\non the 18th was sent from Gembloux, and contained news up to 10\r\no’clock on the previous night, namely, that part of the Prussians had\r\nretired towards Wavre, that Blücher with their centre had fallen back\r\non Perwez, and a column with artillery had moved in the direction of\r\nNamur.[92]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrom another source Napoleon gathered that three bodies of the\r\nPrussians were concentrating at Wavre, vital information which, for\r\nsome inexplicable reason, he did not dispatch to Grouchy until 10 a.m.\r\nWe have it on the authority of Foy, who had fought in Spain, that at\r\ndaybreak Napoleon was told that the junction of Wellington and Blücher\r\nwas possible. This he refused to believe, stating that such an event\r\ncould not take place before the 20th. Grouchy was ordered to keep up\r\nhis communications with Napoleon, pushing before him “those bodies of\r\nPrussians which have taken this direction and which may have stopped at\r\nWavre.” In addition, he was to “follow those columns which have gone\r\nto your right.” Dr Holland Rose pronounces these instructions as far\r\nfrom clear: “Grouchy was not bidden to throw all his efforts on the\r\nside of Wavre; and he was not told whether he must attack the enemy at\r\nthat town, or interpose a wedge between them and Wellington, or support\r\nNapoleon’s right. Now Napoleon would certainly have prescribed an\r\nimmediate concentration of Grouchy’s force towards the north-west for\r\none of the last two objects, had he believed Blücher about to attempt\r\na flank march against the chief French army. Obviously it had not yet\r\nentered his thoughts that so daring a step would be taken by a foe whom\r\nhe pictured as scattered and demoralized by defeat.”[93]\r\n\r\nAs Houssaye, one of the most painstaking of historians, says, “It\r\nis necessary to walk over the ground, to perceive its constantly\r\nundulating formation, similar to the billows of a swelling sea.” I\r\nhave followed his advice for the purposes of the present volume. The\r\nconfiguration of the land near the ridge, which was at first the right\r\ncentre of the Allies, has been altered somewhat by the excavation\r\nof earth for the celebrated but unsightly Lion Mound, otherwise the\r\nfield is much the same as it was in 1815. Major Cotton, who fought at\r\nWaterloo, tells us that on the day of the battle there were “splendid\r\ncrops of rye, wheat, barley, oats, beans, peas, potatoes, tares, and\r\nclover; some of these were of great height. There were a few patches\r\nof ploughed ground.” Exactly the same is true now. The soil which\r\ncovers the mouldering bones of many a hero yields a mighty harvest.\r\nPractically every inch of it is either pasture or under cultivation.\r\n\r\nBy far the most interesting point is the château and farm-house of\r\nHougoumont. The buildings were then over two centuries old, and were\r\nerected with a view to defence, the garden being strongly walled\r\non the south and east sides. In 1815 it was replete with orchard,\r\noutbuildings, banked-up hedges, and a chapel. Additional loop-holes\r\nwere made by Wellington’s orders, a scaffold was erected so that the\r\ntroops could discharge their muskets over the wall, and the flooring\r\nover the south gateway hastily taken up “to enable our men to fire\r\ndown upon the enemy should they force the gate which had been blocked\r\nup.” This strong strategic position before the right flank of the\r\nallied line was admirably defended by the light companies of the second\r\nbattalions of Coldstream and Foot Guards.\r\n\r\nThe battle began with a protracted but successful attack by Napoleon’s\r\nbrother, Jerome, on the Nassauer and Hanoverian troops, which held the\r\nwood in front of the château. Proud of his triumph, and contrary to the\r\nEmperor’s orders, three attempts to assault the grim building were made\r\nand failed. At length Napoleon made up his mind to bombard Hougoumont,\r\nwhich he did to some effect, the chapel and barn blazing fiercely, but\r\nits brave defenders never surrendered. Four days after the battle,\r\nMajor W. E. Frye visited the spot. “At Hougoumont,” he says, “where\r\nthere is an orchard, every tree is pierced with bullets. The barns are\r\nall burned down, and in the courtyard it is said they have been obliged\r\nto burn upwards of a thousand carcases, an awful holocaust to the\r\nWar-Demon.”\r\n\r\nOn one of the outside walls of the little chapel, within which many\r\ngallant soldiers breathed their last, is a bronze tablet erected in\r\n1907, “to the memory of the brave dead by His Britannic Majesty’s\r\nBrigade of Guards and by Comte Charles van der Burch.”[94] The sacred\r\nbuilding has been thoroughly repaired, and the interior white-washed.\r\nThe latter is to be regretted, but was incumbent owing to the vandalism\r\nof visitors whose one aim in life apparently is to carve or scrawl\r\ntheir names upon monuments and buildings.\r\n\r\nWithin easy distance is the farm of La Haye Sainte, still used for the\r\npurpose for which it was originally built. If the thick wall which\r\nabuts the road to the Belgian capital is not so strong as it was--and\r\nthere are signs of recent repair--the most cursory examination is\r\nsufficient to prove that it offered a strong resistance. La Haye Sainte\r\nwas the key of the allied position. It was Napoleon’s ambition to\r\nsecure it, together with the farm of Mont St Jean, so that the enemy’s\r\ncommunications with Brussels and Blücher might be cut off. Wellington\r\nhad unwisely left the defence of La Haye Sainte to a mere handful\r\nof men, 376 in all, of the King’s German Legion. The buildings were\r\nattacked on all sides during the eventful day, and it was not until\r\n6.30 p.m., or thereabouts, when ammunition was exhausted, that the\r\nplace fell. Professor Oman points out that the Emperor should have sent\r\nthe Guard “to the front _en masse_” the moment that happened. This he\r\ndid not do, and a golden opportunity was irretrievably lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    1. Farm of Mont St. Jean\r\n    2. Château of Hougoumont\r\n    3. La Belle Alliance Inn\r\n    4. Farm of La Haye Sainte\r\n\r\nPhotographs by C. Hamilton, Hornsey]\r\n\r\nA little farther up the road, and on the opposite side, is a long,\r\nwhite-washed building known as the farm of Mont St Jean, the hamlet\r\nof that name being the centre of the position. This was the chief\r\nhospital of the Allies, and once a monastery of the Knights Templar.\r\nNear here the Iron Duke drew up the second line of his reserve, with\r\nthree reserve batteries. Napoleon’s headquarters were on the Belle\r\nAlliance height, where he spent the greater part of the day, and where\r\nhe kept the Imperial Guard, nick-named “The Immortals,” in reserve\r\nuntil after 7 p.m. It was not until evening had given place to night\r\nthat the French troops were routed.\r\n\r\nWhen you enter La Belle Alliance Inn you are shown “the historical\r\nchamber of Napoleon.” But let me warn visitors who admire the grotesque\r\npainting of “Wellington Meeting Blücher,” which is nailed to the\r\noutside wall, against believing that this is the scene of the memorable\r\nincident. Mutual congratulations took place before La Belle Alliance\r\nwas reached, the Duke turning off the high road leading to the village\r\nof Waterloo to meet the rugged old soldier when he descried him\r\nsurrounded by his staff.\r\n\r\nWithin a few hundred yards of the inn is a memorial “to the last\r\ncombatants of the Grand Army.” It is by far the most artistic and\r\napposite of the several monuments on the field. With shattered wings\r\nthe French eagle guards the tattered standard of “The Immortals” on the\r\nground where the last square of Napoleon’s famous Guard was cut down.\r\n“It was a fatality,” said the fallen Emperor of the West, “for in spite\r\nof all, I should have won that battle.”\r\n\r\nHaving glanced at the chief objects of interest on the field of\r\nWaterloo, we must now turn our attention to the leading features of the\r\nfight. It is not proposed to enter into minute details, or to discuss\r\nthe many vexed points which have been raised from time to time. Sir\r\nHarry Smith, who took part in the battle, issued a word of warning\r\nyears ago, which we shall endeavour to bear in mind. “Every moment was\r\na crisis,” he said, “and the controversialists had better have left the\r\ndiscussion on the battle-field.”\r\n\r\nThe morning of Sunday, the 18th June 1815, was dismal, foggy, and wet.\r\nNo “Sun of Austerlitz” pierced the low clouds that scudded across the\r\nsky. The state of the weather being then, as now, a universal topic\r\nof conversation and record, we have abundant documentary evidence on\r\nthe subject. After this uninteresting, but not unimportant, fact, our\r\nwitnesses, to a large extent, break down. It would be much easier to\r\ndetail what we do not know about the battle of Waterloo than to put\r\ndown in black and white what may be regarded as indisputable truth.\r\nFor instance, there is an amazing disparity between the times at which\r\neye-witnesses assert the first cannon was fired. The Duke says eleven\r\no’clock, Napoleon two hours later. Alava mentions half-past eleven,\r\nNey one o’clock. Lord Hill, who used a stop-watch, avers with some\r\nsemblance of authority, 11.50 a.m. The Emperor certainly delayed giving\r\nbattle. Soult issued an order between 4 and 5 a.m. for the army to be\r\n“ready to attack at 9 a.m.” At 11 o’clock Napoleon stated that the\r\nsoldiers were to be “in battle array, about an hour after noon.” Scores\r\nof volumes and thousands of pages have been devoted to the subject\r\nof the conflict which concluded Napoleon’s military career. It seems\r\nfairly reasonable to suppose that after the lapse of one hundred years\r\nany further research, although it may throw valuable sidelights on the\r\nbattle, will not solve the problem. We have the Duke’s assurance that\r\n“it is impossible to say when each important occurrence took place,\r\nnor in what order.” To a would-be narrator he wrote, “I recommend\r\nyou to leave the battle of Waterloo as it is,” to another, “the Duke\r\nentertains no hopes of ever seeing an account of all its details which\r\nshall be true,” and again, “I am really disgusted with and ashamed of\r\nall that I have seen of the battle of Waterloo.” That being so, it\r\nis not purposed to view it from a critical standpoint, but merely to\r\ndetail the leading events of the day as these are generally accepted.\r\n\r\nThe ridge on which Napoleon posted his forces in three lines, with a\r\nreserve of 11,000 troops behind the centre, was opposite Mont St Jean,\r\nwith the farm of La Belle Alliance, on the high road from Charleroi to\r\nBrussels, in the centre. The number of troops at his immediate disposal\r\nwas 74,000, and they occupied a front of about two miles. The spectacle\r\nas the French troops deployed “was magnificent,” Napoleon afterwards\r\naverred, not without a touch of imagination, “and the enemy, who was so\r\nplaced as to behold it down to the last man, must have been struck by\r\nit: the army must have seemed to him double in number what it really\r\nwas.”\r\n\r\nJust before the conflict began there was scarcely a mile between the\r\nFrench and Wellington’s 67,000 troops, who were posted across the high\r\nroads leading respectively from Charleroi and Nivelles to Brussels,\r\njust in front of Mont St Jean, where they cross. His right extended to\r\nMerbe Braine, and his left, which he considered was protected by the\r\nadvancing Prussians, was to the westward of the high road. The army was\r\ndrawn up in two lines, the second of which was composed entirely of\r\ncavalry under Lord Uxbridge. To the left Wellington held the villages\r\nof La Haye, Papelotte, and Smohain; Hougoumont was before his right,\r\nLa Haye Sainte in front of the centre, and all were occupied by his\r\ntroops. His reserves, numbering about 17,000, were unseen by the enemy\r\nowing to the formation of the ground, and were posted behind his\r\ncentre and right. At the rear was the forest of Soignes, through which\r\nhe could retreat if necessary. At Hal, nine miles away, the corps of\r\nPrince Frederick of Orange and two brigades of Colville’s division,\r\nsome 14,000 men in all, were stationed. They took no part in the\r\nbattle. Their presence at so great a distance was due to the somewhat\r\nunnecessary anxiety of Wellington, as after events proved, regarding\r\nthe right flank. The Allies’ guns numbered 156, those of the French 246.\r\n\r\nWellington displayed extraordinary activity, and commanded in person.\r\nNapoleon relied on his subordinates far more than was usual with him,\r\nand seemed to take little direct interest in the fighting. He sat in\r\na chair; his antagonist rode about throughout the day. “It is hardly\r\npossible,” says Lord William Lennox, one of his aides-de-camp, “to\r\ndescribe the calm manner in which the hero gave his orders and watched\r\nthe movements and attacks of the enemy. In the midst of danger, bullets\r\nwhistling close about him, round shot ploughed the ground he occupied,\r\nand men and horses falling on every side, he sat upon his favourite\r\ncharger, Copenhagen, as collectedly as if he had been reviewing the\r\nHousehold Troops in Hyde Park.”\r\n\r\nAlthough it would be foolish to endeavour to accurately divide the\r\nbattle in different parts as one would do a sum, for the simple reason\r\nthat fighting was going on all the time and the entire armies of the\r\ncombatants were not used in any given moment, there were five more or\r\nless distinct attacks made by the French which may be useful as keys,\r\nviz.: (1) the diversion against Hougoumont, which opened the battle;\r\n(2) the attack against Wellington’s left-centre; (3) the cavalry attack\r\non the right-centre; (4) a second attempt with infantry and cavalry\r\nhaving a similar object, and an infantry attack against the enemy’s\r\nleft; (5) the charge of the Imperial Guard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Desperate Stand of the Guards at Hougoumont\r\n\r\nR. Caton Woodville]\r\n\r\nThe main attack was against the British left and centre, but by way\r\nof diversion an attempt was first made on the wood of Hougoumont,\r\nwhich was carried after so determined a resistance that Alison, the\r\nhistorian, afterwards counted no fewer than twenty-two shots in a\r\ntree less than six inches in diameter; fairly conclusive evidence\r\nof the death-dealing shower faced by the Nassauers and Hanoverians\r\ndefending the copse and of the vigour of the enemy. The château was\r\nthen attacked, contrary to orders, by Jerome Bonaparte, and brilliantly\r\nrepulsed by the light companies of the second battalions of Coldstream\r\nand Foot Guards.[95] Several attempts were afterwards made to secure\r\nthe place, and dead bodies lay piled in heaps, but those within held\r\nit from the beginning to the end of the battle, although Wellington\r\nfound it necessary to reinforce the men who were upholding Britain’s\r\nhonour so determinedly. The orchard was captured and regained,\r\nhowitzers battered the stout walls, the building was set on fire,\r\nthe door of the courtyard was burst open and shut in the face of the\r\nFrench. These deeds were performed by the fellows of whom Napoleon had\r\nspoken earlier in the day as “breakfast for us!”\r\n\r\nIt was not until about half-past one o’clock, when a black, moving mass\r\nwas seen on the wooded heights of St Lambert that the Emperor really\r\nbestirred himself. Napoleon looked through his glass in the direction\r\nof the object on which nearly all eyes were strained. Some of his\r\nofficers thought it a body of troops, some suggested Prussians, others\r\nGrouchy. “I think,” remarked Soult, “it is five or six thousand men,\r\nprobably part of Grouchy’s army.” In reality it was the advanced guard\r\nof Bülow’s troops, and the Emperor shortly afterwards heard from the\r\nlips of a prisoner that at least 30,000 men were approaching to assist\r\nWellington. However, some light horsemen were sent towards Frischermont\r\nto observe the Prussians,[96] and a postscript was added to a dispatch\r\nalready penned to Grouchy, begging him to “lose not an instant in\r\ndrawing near and joining us, in order to crush Bülow, whom you will\r\ncatch in the very act.”\r\n\r\nWithout delay Napoleon launched D’Erlon’s corps in four columns\r\ntotalling nearly 20,000 men against the enemy’s left-centre, Ney in\r\ncommand. They were supported by far too few cavalry. The Emperor’s idea\r\nwas to take La Haye Sainte, break through the Allied line, and gain\r\nMont St Jean. This operation, if successful, would compel Wellington\r\nto abandon his communications with the Belgian capital and change his\r\nformation. In addition, it would place the French between his army and\r\nthe Prussians. Bylandt’s Dutch-Belgians, who were nearest to the enemy\r\nand consequently more exposed to the covering fire of seventy-eight\r\nguns and the shots of the skirmishers, took to their heels as D’Erlon’s\r\ndivisions, frantically yelling “_Vive l’Empereur!_” approached the\r\nfront line.[97] The brigades of Pack and Kempt were at once brought\r\nforward by Picton. They stood firm and poured death into the oncoming\r\ncolumns, receiving them, as they appeared on the crest of the ridge,\r\nwith fixed bayonets.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Uxbridge, who was in command of the cavalry, realizing\r\nthat the position was still one of considerable danger, then ordered\r\nPonsonby’s Union Brigade--the 1st Royal Dragoons, Scots Greys, and\r\nInniskillings--to charge. It burst upon the French with tremendous\r\nforce and decided the issue.\r\n\r\nSeveral thousands of the enemy were killed or wounded, 8000 taken\r\nprisoners, a number of guns silenced, and two eagles captured.\r\n\r\nThe story of how the colours of the French 45th Regiment were secured\r\nby Serjeant Ewart, a magnificent specimen of a man, over six feet\r\nin height, who served in the Greys, is best told in his own modest\r\nlanguage. “It was in the charge I took the eagle from the enemy,” he\r\nsays; “he and I had a hard contest for it; he made a thrust at my\r\ngroin, I parried it off and cut him down through the head. After this a\r\nlancer came at me; I threw the lance off by my right side, and cut him\r\nthrough the chin and upwards through the teeth. Next, a foot-soldier\r\nfired at me, and then charged me with his bayonet, which I also had\r\nthe good luck to parry, and then I cut him down through the head; thus\r\nended the contest. As I was about to follow my regiment, the General\r\nsaid, ‘My brave fellow, take that to the rear; you have done enough\r\ntill you get quit of it.’ I took the eagle to the ridge, and afterwards\r\nto Brussels.”\r\n\r\nWe have also the record of Captain Clark Kennedy, of the Royal\r\nDragoons, regarding the capture of the eagle of the 105th Regiment.\r\n“I was,” he relates, “in command of the centre squadron of the Royal\r\nDragoons in this charge; while following up the attack, I perceived\r\na little to my left, in the midst of a body of infantry, an eagle\r\nand colour, which the bearer was making off with towards the rear. I\r\nimmediately gave the order to my squadron, ‘Right shoulders forward!’\r\nat the same time leading direct upon the eagle and calling out to the\r\nmen with me to secure the colour; the instant I got within reach of the\r\nofficer who carried the eagle, I ran my sword into his right side, and\r\nhe staggered and fell, but did not reach the ground on account of the\r\npressure of his companions: as the officer was in the act of falling,\r\nI called out a second time to some men close behind me, ‘Secure the\r\ncolour, it belongs to me.’ The standard coverer, Corporal Styles, and\r\nseveral other men rushed up, and the eagle fell across my horse’s head\r\nagainst that of Corporal Styles’s. As it was falling, I caught the\r\nfringe of the flag with my left hand, but could not at first pull up\r\nthe eagle: at the second attempt, however, I succeeded. Being in the\r\nmidst of French troops, I attempted to separate the eagle from the\r\nstaff, to put it into the breast of my coatee, but it was too firmly\r\nfixed. Corporal Styles said, ‘Sir, don’t break it’; to which I replied,\r\n‘Very well; carry it off to the rear as fast as you can.’ He did so.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the victors were too eager, and instead of returning they\r\ncontinued until they were in the French lines, thus enabling Napoleon\r\nto “turn the tables.” His reserve squadrons robbed the British ranks\r\nof 1000 brave men, including Ponsonby. More would have fallen had not\r\nVandeleur’s Light Cavalry Brigade checked the enemy.\r\n\r\nPicton was dead, shot at the head of his men. “When you hear of my\r\ndeath,” the latter had previously remarked to a comrade, “you will\r\nhear of a bloody day.” He had “fallen gloriously at the head of his\r\ndivision, maintaining a position which, if it had not been kept, would\r\nhave altered the fate of the day.”[98]\r\n\r\nThe following account of the magnificent charge of Ponsonby’s Union\r\nBrigade, from the pen of James Armour, Rough-rider to the Scots Greys,\r\nwho took part in it, gives some idea of the work performed:\r\n\r\n“Orders were now given that we were to prepare to charge. We gave our\r\ncountrymen in front of us three hearty huzzas, and waving our swords\r\naloft in the air, several swords were struck with balls while so doing;\r\nand I must not forget the piper--\r\n\r\n    _The piper loud and louder blew,\r\n    The balls of all denominations quick and quicker flew._\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders were then ordered to wheel back--I think by sections,\r\nbut I am not certain: infantry words of command differ from the\r\ncavalry. When they had, and were wheeling back imperfectly, we rushed\r\nthrough them; at the same time they huzzaed us, calling out, ‘_Now, my\r\nboys--Scotland for ever!_’ I must own it had a thrilling effect upon\r\nme. I am certain numbers of them were knocked over by the horses: in\r\nour anxiety we could not help it. Some said ‘I didna think ye wad hae\r\nsair’d me sae’--catching hold of our legs and stirrups, as we passed,\r\nto support themselves. When we got clear through the Highlanders (92nd)\r\nwe were now on the charge, and a short one it was. A cross road being\r\nin our way, we leaped the first hedge gallantly; crossed the road, and\r\nhad to leap over another hedge. At this time the smoke from the firing\r\non both sides made it so that we could not see distinctly. We had not\r\ncharged far--not many yards, till we came to a column. We were pretty\r\nwell together as yet, although a great number fell about that cross\r\nroad. We were in the column in a very short time (making pretty clean\r\nwork). We still pushed forward, at least as many as could--a number had\r\ndropped off by this time--and soon came to another column. They cried\r\nout, ‘Prisoners!’ and threw down their arms, and stripped themselves of\r\ntheir belts (I think it is part of the French discipline to do so), and\r\nran to our rear. Ay, they ran like hares. We still pushed on, and came\r\nupon another column; and some of them went down on their knees, calling\r\nout ‘Quarter!’ in a very supplicatory way....\r\n\r\n“We now got amongst the guns, the terrible guns, which had annoyed us\r\nso much. _Such slaughtering!_--men cut down and run through, horses\r\nhoughed, harness cut, and all rendered useless. Some, who were judges\r\nof such work, reckoned we had made a very good job of it. Amongst the\r\nguns--I think six or seven in number, all brass--that I was engaged\r\nwith, mostly all the men were cut down, and the horses, most of them,\r\nif not all, were houghed. While we were at work amongst these guns,\r\nnever thinking but, when we were done with it, we would have nothing\r\nto do but to return from where we came; but I must own I was very\r\nmuch surprised, when we began to retrace our steps, when what should\r\nwe behold coming away across betwixt us and our own army but a great\r\nnumber of these cuirassiers and lancers, the first I ever beheld in my\r\nlife, who were forming up in order to cut off our retreat; but, nothing\r\ndaunted, we faced them manfully. We had none to command us now, but\r\nevery man did what he could. ‘Conquer or die!’ was the word. When the\r\nregiment returned from the charge mentioned, the troops that I belonged\r\nto did not muster above one or two sound men (unwounded) belonging to\r\nthe front rank. Indeed the whole troop did not muster above a dozen;\r\nthere were upwards of twenty of the front rank killed, and the others\r\nwounded.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the farm of La Haye Sainte, held by a detachment of the\r\nGerman Legion under Major Baring, had been the object of assault\r\nby a French division detached for that purpose, and the defenders\r\nwere driven from the orchard. Reinforcements were sent forward by\r\nWellington, followed by additional cavalry by Napoleon. The cuirassiers\r\nwere met by Lord Edward Somerset’s Brigade, led by the Earl of\r\nUxbridge, and driven back after a furious struggle for supremacy.\r\nNot until the last pinch of powder was spent and several determined\r\nattempts had been made to secure the place, did the brave fellows\r\nvacate their position to D’Erlon’s infantry, between six and seven\r\no’clock.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the afternoon Milhaud’s cuirassiers, supported\r\nby light cavalry and dragoons, attacked the British right-centre.\r\nWellington at once formed his troops in squares. When the crash came\r\nthey stood firm and unbroken.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief lost not a moment. The heavy brigade of Lord\r\nEdward Somerset was flung against the Frenchmen and drove them from the\r\nridge.[99] The artillery flamed destruction. Charge followed charge,\r\nthirteen in all, but the British squares remained steady, although\r\ncontinually reduced. Nearly all Wellington’s cavalry were pressed into\r\nservice, and with the exception of a solitary Dutch-Belgian division,\r\nall his infantry reserve was employed. An officer who served in\r\nHalkett’s brigade has left a vivid account of this part of the battle.\r\n\r\n“Hougoumont and its wood,” he writes, “sent up a broad flame through\r\nthe dark masses of smoke that overhung the field; beneath this cloud\r\nthe French were indistinctly visible. Here a waving mass of long\r\nred feathers could be seen; there, gleams as from a sheet of steel\r\nshowed that the cuirassiers were moving; 400 cannon were belching\r\nforth fire and death on every side; the roaring and shouting were\r\nindistinguishably commixed--together they gave me an idea of a\r\nlabouring volcano. Bodies of infantry and cavalry were pouring down\r\non us, and it was time to leave contemplation, so I moved towards\r\nour columns, which were standing up in square.... As I entered the\r\nrear face of our square I had to step over a body, and looking down,\r\nrecognised Harry Beere, an officer of our Grenadiers, who about an hour\r\nbefore shook hands with me, laughing, as I left the columns.... The\r\ntear was not dry on my cheek when poor Harry was no longer thought of.\r\nIn a few minutes after, the enemy’s cavalry galloped up and crowned\r\nthe crest of our position. Our guns were abandoned,[100] and they\r\nformed between the two brigades, about a hundred paces in our front.\r\nTheir first charge was magnificent. As soon as they quickened their\r\ntrot into a gallop, the cuirassiers bent their heads so that the\r\npeaks of their helmets looked like vizors, and they seemed cased in\r\narmour from the plume to the saddle. Not a shot was fired till they\r\nwere within thirty yards, when the word was given, and our men fired\r\naway at them. The effect was magical. Through the smoke we could see\r\nhelmets falling, cavaliers starting from their seats with convulsive\r\nsprings as they received our balls, horses plunging and rearing in the\r\nagonies of fright and pain, and crowds of the soldiery dismounted,\r\npart of the squadron in retreat, but the more daring remainder backing\r\ntheir horses to force them on our bayonets. Our fire soon disposed of\r\nthese gentlemen. The main body re-formed in our front, and rapidly and\r\ngallantly repeated their attacks. In fact, from this time (about four\r\no’clock) till near six, we had a constant repetition of these brave but\r\nunavailing charges. There was no difficulty in repulsing them, but our\r\nammunition decreased alarmingly. At length an artillery wagon galloped\r\nup, emptied two or three casks of cartridges into the square, and we\r\nwere all comfortable....\r\n\r\n“Though we constantly thrashed our steel-clad opponents, we found\r\nmore troublesome customers in the round shot and grape, which all\r\nthis time played on us with terrible effect, and fully avenged the\r\ncuirassiers. Often as the volleys created openings in our square would\r\nthe cavalry dash on, but they were uniformly unsuccessful. A regiment\r\non our right seemed sadly disconcerted, and at one moment was in\r\nconsiderable confusion. Halkett rode out to them, and seizing their\r\ncolour, waved it over his head, and restored them to something like\r\norder, though not before his horse was shot under him. At the height of\r\ntheir unsteadiness we got the order to ‘right face’ to move to their\r\nassistance; some of the men mistook it for ‘right about face,’ and\r\nfaced accordingly, when old Major M‘Laine, 73rd, called out, ‘No, my\r\nboys, its “right face”; you’ll never hear the right about as long as a\r\nFrench bayonet is in front of you!’”\r\n\r\nAt Planchenoit, in the rear of the French centre, Lobau and his 10,000\r\nmen were doing their upmost to prevent Bülow with three times that\r\nnumber of troops from succouring Wellington. The French held the\r\nvillage for two hours, and then saw it fall into the hands of the\r\nenemy, but only for a time. Some of the Young Guard and three batteries\r\nof artillery had been sent by the Emperor to support Lobau, and when\r\nthey arrived the scales again turned in favour of the French. While\r\nthis body was held in check, Napoleon’s infantry had suffered near\r\nHougoumont, but La Haye Sainte had fallen, as already noticed. Had\r\nNapoleon sent reinforcements to Ney he might have won the battle, but\r\nhe hesitated to use his remaining reserves. Before anything further was\r\ndone, Wellington had made fresh dispositions, and Ziethen’s men, who\r\nhad marched by way of Ohain, were on the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charge of the Scots Greys at Waterloo\r\n\r\nR. Caton Woodville]\r\n\r\nSix battalions of the Middle Guard and two battalions of the Old\r\nGuard were at last sent forward.[101] As they crossed the open ground\r\nbetween Hougoumont and the high road the artillery played sad havoc\r\nwith some of them, but behind the crest of the ridge was Maitland’s\r\nbrigade of the Foot Guards, led by Wellington, himself. “Up, Guards,\r\nand make ready!” he shouted, and ere the first column was upon them the\r\nBritish infantry had dealt a deadly fire into its ranks which made it\r\npause. The second column was caught in flank by Adam’s Brigade. Then\r\ntwo brigades of British cavalry charged, and although the celebrated\r\nImperial Guards endeavoured to hold their own they were forced back.\r\nBlücher, who had arrived at a most opportune moment, carried the\r\nposition occupied by the French right at Papelotte and La Haye with\r\nZiethen’s corps. The whole Allied line then advanced, the heights\r\nwere carried, and Napoleon’s last army, on the victory of which he\r\nhad staked his all, was scattered. The battle of Waterloo was won.\r\n“My plan,” said the Commander-in-Chief, “was to keep my ground until\r\nthe Prussians appeared, and then to attack the French position; and I\r\nexecuted my plan.”\r\n\r\nThroughout the night the Prussians followed up the defeated legions,\r\nwhich got across the Sambre on the 19th. Some 30,000 of Napoleon’s\r\nmen were killed or wounded, and 13,000 of the Allied army, more than\r\nhalf of whom were British. On the 22nd June 1815, the fallen Emperor\r\nabdicated in favour of his son; on the 7th July the Allies entered\r\nParis in triumph, and eight days later Napoleon surrendered to Captain\r\nMaitland, of H.M.S. _Bellerophon_.\r\n\r\n    _The Desolator desolate!\r\n      The Victor overthrown!\r\n    The Arbiter of others fate\r\n      A Suppliant for his own!_\r\n\r\n    BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nWellington the Statesman\r\n\r\n(1815-52)\r\n\r\n  “_It is the duty of all to look our difficulties in the face and to\r\n  lay the ground for getting the better of them._”\r\n\r\n            WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the good folk of London were listening to the guns of the\r\nTower and of the Park, which told of the Waterloo victory, and the\r\njoyful news was percolating to the smallest hamlet, Wellington was\r\nfighting a battle in which neither sword nor gun was involved. It was\r\none of diplomacy, and he proved the conqueror. Blücher, armed with\r\nthe Declaration of the 13th March 1815 to the effect that “Napoleon\r\nBonaparte is put beyond the pale of social and civil relations, and\r\nas enemy and disturber of the repose of the world, he is delivered\r\nover to public vengeance,” was for seizing the fallen Emperor and\r\nshooting him as an outlaw at Vincennes, the scene of the Duc d’Enghien\r\ntragedy.[102] The bloodthirsty Prussian asked for Wellington’s views\r\non the matter. He received them without delay, and expressed in such a\r\nway that Blücher must have felt thoroughly ashamed of himself, if only\r\nfor a passing moment. “They had both acted too distinguished a part in\r\nthe recent transactions to become executioners,” the Duke wrote. This\r\nsingle sentence reveals the sterling uprightness of the man and his\r\nhatred of unnecessary bloodshed. Even supposing that he had received\r\nauthority for the carrying out of such a measure, it is extremely\r\ndoubtful whether Wellington would have concurred in his colleague’s\r\nwish. Blücher sneered--and accepted the decision. Wellington also found\r\nhimself in disagreement with the Prussian view regarding the bridge\r\nof Jena at Paris, which commemorated the crushing Prussian defeat\r\nof October 1806. Blücher, with true patriotic zeal as it seemed to\r\nhim, was for blowing it to pieces. Wellington regarded the idea as\r\nfoolish, and he carried his point. It would have been a bitter day for\r\nthe Capital had Blücher been allowed to work his will. The Prussian\r\nCommander insisted on levying a contribution on the city of Paris of\r\n100,000,000 francs. Wellington upset the scheme by insisting that the\r\nquestion was one for the Allied sovereigns to arrange. For the third\r\ntime vindictive Blücher had to give in.\r\n\r\nWhen the Provisional Government appealed to the Duke with reference\r\nto Napoleon’s successor, he bluntly told them that “the best security\r\nfor Europe was the restoration of the King,” namely, Louis XVIII, and\r\nthat he should be recalled “without loss of time, so as to avoid the\r\nappearance of the measure having been forced upon them by the allies.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Exile King returned to Paris the enormous demands of\r\ncertain of the Powers, particularly of Austria and Prussia, had to\r\nbe discussed. Had it not been for the resistance of Castlereagh,\r\nWellington, and Nesselrode, extensive partitions undoubtedly would\r\nhave resulted. As finally settled by the Second Treaty of Paris,\r\nconcluded on the 20th November, the territory of France was reduced\r\nto practically the limits of 1790, an indemnity of 700,000,000 francs\r\nwas determined for the expenses of the war, and an army of occupation\r\nnot exceeding 150,000 troops under the Duke was to garrison the\r\nchief frontier fortresses, including Valenciennes, Cambray, Quesnoy,\r\nMaubeuge, and Landrecy, for a maximum period of five years, the\r\nexpense being met by the French Government. The magnificent art\r\ntreasures, which Napoleon had gloried in plundering, were to be\r\nreturned to their rightful owners. That is why the celebrated bronze\r\nhorses of St Mark may be seen on the great Venetian Cathedral to-day,\r\nand the wonderful “Descent from the Cross,” by Rubens, admired in the\r\nCathedral of Antwerp, from whence it had been taken to find a temporary\r\nresting-place in the Louvre.\r\n\r\nAn excellent account of the Army of Occupation is given by a Scotsman\r\nwho visited Paris shortly after the battle of Waterloo. There were\r\ncomparatively few Austrians, the majority of them being in the south\r\nof France, but those seen by the writer of _Paul’s Letters to his\r\nKinsfolk_ were “bulky men” who “want the hardy and athletic look of\r\nthe British, Russians, or Prussians.” The Russian infantry were “fine,\r\nfirm, steady-looking men, clean, handsome, but by no means remarkable\r\nfor stature.” The artillery were “in the highest possible order,”\r\nthe cavalry “remarkably fine men,” the appearance of the Cossacks\r\n“prepossessing.” The Prussians, while never having been accused of\r\n“gross violence,” succeeded in wrecking the Château de Montmorency,\r\nwhere a large body of them was quartered. Camp-kettles were boiled with\r\npicture-frames, and the furniture stripped by female camp followers.\r\nPaul notes that the Prussian officers were the principal customers of\r\nthe expensive restaurants and theatres, but that many British officers\r\nof rank had gone so far as to decline the quarters appointed them in\r\nprivate houses. He bestows much praise on Wellington for his discipline\r\nand justice: “The strong sense and firmness for which the Duke is as\r\nmuch distinguished as for skill in arms and bravery in the field of\r\nbattle, easily saw that the high and paramount part which Britain now\r\nholds in Europe, that preeminence which, in so many instances, has made\r\nher and her delegates the chosen mediators when disputes occurred\r\namongst the allied powers, depends entirely on our maintaining pure\r\nand sacred the national character for good faith and disinterested\r\nhonour. The slightest complaint, therefore, of want of discipline or\r\noppression perpetrated by a British officer or soldier has instantly\r\nmet with reprehension and punishment, and the result has been the\r\nreducing the French to the cruel situation of hating us without having\r\nany complaint to justify themselves for doing so, even in their own\r\neyes.... The soldiers, without exception, both British and foreigners,\r\nconduct themselves in public with civility, are very rarely to be\r\nseen intoxicated, though the means are so much within reach; and,\r\nconsidering all the irritating circumstances that exist, few quarrels\r\noccur betwixt them and the populace. Very strong precautions are,\r\nhowever, taken in case of any accidental or premeditated commotion.”\r\n\r\nWellington threw the whole weight of his influence on the side of\r\nmoderation. Prussia was all for partition, for getting her territorial\r\n“pound of flesh,” but the calmer statesmanship of the diplomatists\r\nalready mentioned, especially of Wellington, won the day. The Duke’s\r\npolicy is clearly outlined in his dispatch of the 11th August, which,\r\nin the opinion of Dr Holland Rose, “deserves to rank among his highest\r\ntitles to fame.”\r\n\r\nWellington states that while France has been left “in too great\r\nstrength for the rest of Europe, weakened as all the powers of Europe\r\nhave been by the wars in which they have been engaged with France,”\r\nhis objection to the demand of a “great cession from France upon this\r\noccasion is, that it will defeat the object which the Allies have held\r\nout to themselves in the present and the preceding wars.” He then\r\nproceeds to detail what were, in his opinion, the various causes which\r\nled to so much bloodshed: “to put an end to the French Revolution, to\r\nobtain peace for themselves and their people, to have the power of\r\nreducing their overgrown military establishments, and the leisure\r\nto attend to the internal concerns of their several nations, and to\r\nimprove the situation of their people. The Allies took up arms against\r\nBuonaparte because it was certain that the world could not be at peace\r\nas long as he should possess, or should be in a situation to attain,\r\nsupreme power in France; and care must be taken,” he adds, “in making\r\nthe arrangements consequent upon our success, that we do not leave the\r\nworld in the same unfortunate situation respecting France that it would\r\nhave been in if Buonaparte had continued in possession of his power.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke then goes on to review the situation. If Louis XVIII were to\r\nrefuse the cession of territory, his people would undoubtedly support\r\nhim, and the Allies “might take the fortresses and provinces which\r\nmight suit them, but there would be no genuine peace for the world,\r\nno nation could disarm, no Sovereign could turn his attention from\r\nthe affairs of this country.” If the King consented to the partition,\r\n“which, from all that one hears, is an event by no means probable, the\r\nAllies must be satisfied, and must retire; but I would appeal to the\r\nexperience of the transactions of last year for a statement of the\r\nsituation in which we should find ourselves.” France was then reduced\r\nto her limits of 1792, and “the Allies were obliged to maintain each\r\nin the field half of the war establishment stipulated in the treaty of\r\nChaumont, in order to guard their conquests, and what had been ceded to\r\nthem.” In France “the general topic of conversation was the recovery\r\nof the left bank of the Rhine as the frontier of France.” Wellington\r\ntherefore preferred “the temporary occupation of some of the strong\r\nplaces, and to maintain for a time a strong force in France, both at\r\nthe expense of the French Government, and under strict regulation, to\r\nthe permanent cession of even all the places which in my opinion ought\r\nto be occupied for a time. These measures will not only give us,\r\nduring the period of occupation, all the military security which could\r\nbe expected from the permanent cession, but, if carried into execution\r\nin the spirit in which they are conceived, they are in themselves the\r\nbond of peace.”\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of his stay in France, broken by a short visit\r\nto England in 1816, Wellington was far from popular, and one or two\r\nattempts were made on his life. It was scarcely to be expected that\r\na man who had been pre-eminently successful in the field against the\r\nnation’s armies would be lauded as a popular hero, but, as we have\r\nseen, he had helped to save the country from a bitter and vindictive\r\nhumiliation. He finally returned home in 1818, when the Army of\r\nOccupation evacuated France with the consent of the Powers at the\r\nrequest of its Commander-in-Chief. He never again drew his sword in\r\nwarfare, but he maintained a commanding position in the affairs of\r\nGreat Britain until the close of his long life.\r\n\r\nHis honours and orders were now varied and many. England and foreign\r\ncountries honoured themselves by honouring him. Parliament voted him\r\n£200,000 for the erection or purchase of Strathfieldsaye, Hampshire,\r\nand the estate granted to him as Prince of Waterloo by the King of the\r\nNetherlands was valued at £4000 per annum. On his return to England\r\nhe became Master of the Ordnance, which entitled him to a seat in the\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 Wellington revisited the scene of his most famous battle with\r\nGeorge IV, and afterwards proceeded to Verona to represent, with Lord\r\nStrangford, Great Britain at the Congress about to be held there to\r\ndetermine the attitude of England, France, Russia, Austria, and Prussia\r\nregarding various matters, including the insurrection in Greece and\r\nthe relations of Russia and Turkey in the matter, the evacuation of\r\nPiedmont and Naples by the Austrian troops, the slave trade, and more\r\nparticularly the unhappy state of affairs in Spain, which country\r\nwas then in a state of civil war. Should the five Powers send armed\r\nassistance to Ferdinand, whom Wellington’s victories in the Peninsula\r\nhad replaced on the throne? Answering for his own country the Duke\r\nmaintained the principle of non-interference excepting in a case of\r\nnecessity. In this matter Great Britain stood alone, and the Duke had\r\nto run the gauntlet of fierce criticism on his return to England.\r\n\r\nHis next continental journey was in 1826, when he was sent on a special\r\nmission to Petersburg on the accession of the Emperor Nicholas, with\r\nthe object of arriving at a satisfactory settlement of the projected\r\nRussian attack on Turkey over the Greek difficulty. In this he was not\r\nentirely successful, for after events proved that he had only succeeded\r\nin staving off the evil day.\r\n\r\nOn the death of the Duke of York in the following year, Wellington\r\nwas appointed Commander-in-Chief, retaining his other office, which\r\ncontrolled merely the artillery and engineers.\r\n\r\nA month later Canning became Prime Minister, and the Duke was asked to\r\ncontinue as a member of the Cabinet. This request he not only declined,\r\nbut surrendered his two important offices as well. Mutual suspicion\r\nseems to have been the cause of this unexpected event, certainly not\r\njealousy, for Wellington said that he should be “worse than mad if\r\nhe had ever thought of it for a moment,” the “it” referring to his\r\npossible appointment as First Lord of the Treasury. Canning did not\r\nlive long to enjoy the sweets of office, for he died on the following\r\nAugust, and was succeeded by “Prosperity” Robinson, otherwise Lord\r\nGoderich, who resigned at the beginning of 1828.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, once again Commander-in-Chief, was sent for by George IV,\r\nand requested to form a Ministry. He obeyed with the instinct of a\r\nsoldier when ordered by his superior officer, rather than as a keen\r\npolitician about to have his highest ambition gratified. Wellington\r\nwas a Tory, and the political freedom of the Roman Catholics and the\r\nreform of Parliament were the burning questions of the hour. The\r\nDuke was uncertain as to the practical utility of either, but he was\r\nnot prepared to go against the known wishes of the nation so far\r\nas the religious question was concerned. After navigating a sea of\r\ndifficulties, the Roman Catholic Relief Bill passed both Houses in\r\nthe early days of 1829. One of his opponents, the Earl of Winchilsea,\r\ncharged Wellington with “breaking in upon the Constitution of 1688\r\nin order that he might the more effectively, under the cloak of\r\nsome outward show of zeal for the Protestant religion, carry on his\r\ninsidious designs for the infringement of our liberties, and the\r\nintroduction of Popery in every department of the State.” The Premier\r\nrequested an apology, which was not forthcoming, whereupon the former\r\ndemanded “satisfaction,” in other words, a duel. Sir Henry Hardinge for\r\nWellington and Lord Falmouth for Winchilsea were the respective seconds.\r\n\r\nThe meeting took place in Battersea Fields.[103] “Now then, Hardinge,”\r\nsaid the Duke, “look sharp and step out the ground. I have no time\r\nto waste. Don’t stick him up so near the ditch. If I hit him he will\r\ntumble in.” The signal was given to fire. Noting that his opponent did\r\nnot level his pistol on the command being given, the Duke purposely\r\nfired wide, and an instant afterwards Winchilsea fired in the air.\r\nThe latter then produced a written sheet which he called an apology,\r\nwhich had to be altered before it met with Wellington’s approval. “Good\r\nmorning, my Lord Winchilsea; good morning, my Lord Falmouth,” cried the\r\nDuke as he saluted with two fingers, and, mounting his horse, cantered\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThe Duke had a most thankless task during his administration, so much\r\nso that we find him writing, “If I had known in January 1828, one\r\ntithe of what I do now, and of what I discovered one month after I\r\nwas in office, I should never have been the King’s Minister, and so\r\nhave avoided loads of misery. However, I trust God Almighty will soon\r\ndetermine that I have been sufficiently punished for my sins and will\r\nrelieve me from the unlucky lot which has befallen me. I believe there\r\nnever was a man who suffered so much for so little purpose.”\r\n\r\nHe had almost as much trouble with the King as had Pitt with George\r\nIII, and many of his old supporters were indignant with him over the\r\nRelief Bill. Wellington vehemently opposed Parliamentary Reform in the\r\nface of public opinion, with the result that his Ministry rode to a\r\nfall in November 1830.\r\n\r\nTwo months before he had taken part in the opening ceremony of the\r\nManchester and Liverpool Railway, the first line to cater for passenger\r\ntraffic in the British Empire. He rode in one of the two trains which\r\nmade the initial journey, and the fact that they both went in the same\r\ndirection was the cause of a lamentable accident which deprived one of\r\nWellington’s friends of his life. The incident occurred at Parkside,\r\nwhere the engines stopped to obtain a supply of water. While the trains\r\nwere at a standstill, Mr Huskisson, formerly President of the Board\r\nof Trade, got out of the carriage in which he had been travelling and\r\nsought Wellington. A minute or two later the train on the opposite\r\nline started. One of the open doors knocked him down, and his right\r\nleg was crushed by the locomotive. The Duke and several others ran to\r\nthe injured man’s assistance, but his injuries were such that he only\r\nsurvived a few hours.\r\n\r\nWellington was succeeded as First Lord of the Treasury by Earl Grey,\r\nwhose Government was speedily defeated by the Reform Bill which it\r\nintroduced being rejected by the Lords. Riots broke out in London\r\nand the provinces; William IV “was frightened by the appearance of\r\nthe people outside of St James’s”; the celebrated Dr Arnold wrote\r\nthat his “sense of the evils of the times, and to what purpose I am\r\nbringing up my children, is overwhelmingly bitter.” The King implored\r\nthe Ministers not to hand in their resignation, the House of Commons\r\ncarried by a large majority a vote of confidence in the Government, and\r\nthe nation showed that it bitterly resented the action of the Lords.\r\nThere was an attempt at compromise, but the concessions were so trivial\r\nfrom Wellington’s point of view that he declined to take part in the\r\nnegotiations. After further angry scenes in the following session Grey\r\nresigned on the 9th May 1832. It was during this trying period of our\r\nnational history that the window-panes of Apsley House were stoned and\r\nthe Duke’s life was threatened.[104]\r\n\r\nOnce again the King requested Wellington to form a new administration,\r\nand several meetings were held with that idea in view, but to no\r\npurpose. He had to confess that the task was absolutely impossible:\r\n“I felt that my duty to the King required that I should make a great\r\nsacrifice of opinion to serve him, and to save his Majesty and the\r\ncountry from what I considered a great evil. Others were not of the\r\nsame opinion. I failed in performing the service which I intended to\r\nperform....” Several resident members of Oxford University, including\r\nProfessor the Rev. John Keble, impressed by the Duke’s devotion,\r\nraised funds for the purpose of a bust to commemorate his self-denying\r\nconduct. This appreciation of approval greatly pleased Wellington,\r\nwho announced his intention of sitting for Chantrey, the celebrated\r\nsculptor, or whoever else the committee might choose, “with the\r\ngreatest satisfaction.” When Grey resumed office the Reform Bill was\r\nread for a third time and passed, a number of peers having declared\r\n“that in consequence of the present state of affairs they have come\r\nto the resolution of dropping their further opposition to the Reform\r\nBill, so that it may pass without delay as nearly as possible in its\r\npresent shape.” Wellington quietly left the House. He was no more\r\nkindly disposed towards the Irish Reform Bill, and subjected it to a\r\nfire of criticism which did not, however, preclude it from passing.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable events of the Duke’s crowded life occurred\r\nin November 1834. When Earl Grey resigned in July 1834, on which\r\noccasion his opponent made a graceful speech to the effect that\r\nthere had been no personal hostility in his opposition, the retiring\r\nstatesman recommended Lord Melbourne as his successor. This suggestion\r\nmet with the King’s approval, but the reign of the new Administration\r\nlasted only until the middle of the following November. His Majesty\r\nsent for Wellington at six in the morning. The latter refused to form\r\na Cabinet, and recommended Sir Robert Peel, who was then in Rome. The\r\nDuke promised to carry on the Government during the interim, with the\r\nresult that he held the offices of First Lord of the Treasury, Home\r\nSecretary, Foreign and Colonial Secretary, and Secretary at War for\r\nnearly a month. On Peel’s return he appointed his industrious ally\r\nForeign Secretary, a position he held until the following April, when\r\nthe Government resigned. In 1841, in Peel’s second Administration, he\r\noccupied a seat in the Cabinet, without office, and in the following\r\nyear he was created Commander-in-Chief for life by patent under the\r\ngreat seal.\r\n\r\nDuring the Chartist agitation Wellington was asked who was to command\r\nthe forces in London, where a riot was expected. He answered, “I\r\ncan name no one except the Duke of Wellington.” He organized the\r\narrangements with his usual thoroughness, disposing his troops to keep\r\nthem out of sight, and taking prompt measures to protect important\r\npublic buildings. Fortunately the excitement died down, and armed force\r\nwas not required.\r\n\r\nThe Duke frequently spent several hours a day at the Horse Guards.\r\n“Speaking from the experience which I had of him,” says General Sir\r\nGeorge Brown, G.C.B., “I should say that the Duke was a remarkably\r\nagreeable man to do business with, because of his clear and ready\r\ndecision. However much I may have seen him irritated and excited,\r\nwith the subjects which I have repeatedly had to bring under his\r\nnotice, I have no recollection of his ever having made use of a harsh\r\nor discourteous expression to me, or of his having dismissed me\r\nwithout a distinct and explicit answer or decision in the case under\r\nconsideration. Like all good men of business, who consider well before\r\ncoming to a decision, his Grace was accustomed to adhere strictly to\r\nprecedent; to the decisions he may have previously come to on similar\r\ncases. This practice greatly facilitated the task of those who had to\r\ntransact business with him, seeing that all we had to do in concluding\r\nour statement of any particular case was to refer to his decision or\r\nsome similar one.”\r\n\r\n“Everybody writes to me for everything,” he once remarked to Stanhope.\r\n“They know the Duke of Wellington is said to be a good-natured man,\r\nand so at the least they will get an answer.” The Earl, astonished at\r\nthe amount of the Duke’s correspondence, ventured to say that his host\r\nmight expect to be allowed some rest and recreation while he was at\r\nWalmer. “Rest!” cried the Duke. “Every other animal--even a donkey--a\r\ncostermonger’s donkey--is allowed some rest, but the Duke of Wellington\r\nnever! There is no help for it. As long as I am able to go on, they\r\nwill put the saddle upon my back and make me go.”\r\n\r\nGeorgiana, Lady De Ros, who was a frequent visitor at Walmer Castle and\r\nat Strathfieldsaye, relates an incident which has a direct bearing on\r\nthis point. “Wellington,” she says, “would tell a story against himself\r\nsometimes, and amused us all quite in his latter days by the account\r\nof various impostures that had been practised upon him; for years he\r\nhad helped an imaginary officer’s daughter, paid for music lessons for\r\nher, given her a piano, paid for her wedding trousseau, for her child’s\r\nfuneral, etc., etc. At last it came out that _one man_ was the author\r\nof these impostures, ‘and then,’ the Duke said, ‘an Officer from the\r\nMendicity Society called on me and gave me such a scolding as I never\r\nhad before in my life!’”\r\n\r\nIn a book inscribed as “A Slight Souvenir of the Season 1845-6” we find\r\na delightful little glimpse of “the hero of a hundred fights” as a\r\ncountry gentlemen. “What can be a finer sight than to see the Duke of\r\nWellington enter the hunting field?” the author asks. “Not one of those\r\ngorgeous spectacles, it is true, such as a coronation, a review, the\r\nLord Mayor’s Show, or a procession to the Houses of Parliament--not one\r\nof those pompous Continental exhibitions called a _chasse_, where armed\r\nmenials keep back the crowd, and brass bands proclaim alike the find\r\nand finish; but what can be a finer sight--a sight more genial to the\r\nmind of a Briton--than the mighty Wellington entering the hunting field\r\nwith a single attendant, making no more fuss than a country squire?\r\nYet many have seen the sight, and many, we trust, may yet see it. The\r\nDuke takes the country sport like a country gentleman--no man less the\r\ngreat man than this greatest of all men; affable to all, his presence\r\nadds joy to the scene. The Duke is a true sportsman, and has long been\r\na supporter of the Vine and Sir John Cope’s hounds. He kept hounds\r\nhimself during the Peninsular War, and divers good stories are related\r\nof them and their huntsman (Tom Crane), whose enthusiasm used sometimes\r\nto carry him in the enemy’s country, a fact that he used to be reminded\r\nof by a few bullets whizzing about his ears.”\r\n\r\nWellington was now the trusted friend of Queen Victoria, who ever held\r\nhim in the highest esteem. He was one of the first persons, perhaps\r\nactually the first,[105] outside the Royal family and the medical\r\nattendants to see the baby who afterwards became Edward VII. According\r\nto one account he was met outside Buckingham Palace by Lord Hill, who\r\nwas informed “All over--fine boy, very fine boy, almost as red as you\r\nHill.”\r\n\r\nTwo days after the first anniversary of the birthday of Edward Albert,\r\nPrince of Wales, the Queen and the Prince Consort, accompanied by the\r\nRoyal children, journeyed to Walmer Castle to pay the Duke a visit. An\r\neven greater honour was reserved for the veteran warrior, for on the\r\nbirth of her Majesty’s third son on the 1st May 1850, it got noised\r\nabroad that the infant was to be called Arthur, “in compliment to the\r\nHero of Waterloo.” The present Duke of Connaught is thus a living link\r\nwith Wellington. “I must not omit to mention,” the Queen writes exactly\r\na year later, “an interesting episode of this day, viz., the visit of\r\nthe good old Duke on this his eighty-second birthday, to his little\r\ngodson, our dear little boy. He came to us both at five, and gave him a\r\ngolden cup and some toys, which he had himself chosen, and Arthur gave\r\nhim a nosegay.”\r\n\r\nThe day was also that on which the great Exhibition at the Crystal\r\nPalace was opened. “The Royal party,” says Queen Victoria, “were\r\nreceived with continued acclamation as they passed through the Park and\r\nround the Exhibition house, and it was also very interesting to witness\r\nthe cordial greeting given to the Duke of Wellington. I was just behind\r\nhim and Anglesey [on whose arm he was leaning], during the procession\r\nround the building, and he was accompanied by an incessant running fire\r\nof applause from the men, and waving of handkerchiefs and kissing of\r\nhands from the women, who lined the pathway of the march during the\r\nthree-quarters of an hour that it took us to march round....”\r\n\r\nAlthough the Duke never courted popularity, seemed indeed to shun it\r\nand to regard the satisfaction shown by some of his colleagues in the\r\nplaudits of the multitude as a sign of weakness, there can be little\r\ndoubt that he felt a glow of inward pleasure, however slight, when he\r\nreflected on the good feeling displayed towards him in the closing\r\nyears of his long and well-filled life. Apt to be somewhat cynical on\r\noccasion, and to think that the times were “like sweet bells jangled,\r\nout of tune and harsh,” he was neither censorious nor vindictive.\r\nNelson preached the gospel of Duty, but Wellington lived it and\r\nsacrificed everything to it.\r\n\r\nBrougham, as champion of Parliamentary Reform, was an opponent of\r\nWellington, but in middle age he took up an independent position, and\r\nhas left in his “Historical Sketches of Statesmen who flourished in the\r\nTime of George III” a magnificent testimony of the Duke’s worth.\r\n\r\n“The peculiar characteristic of this great man,” he writes, “and which,\r\nthough far less dazzling than his exalted genius, and his marvellous\r\nfortune, is incomparably more useful for the contemplation of the\r\nstatesman, as well as the moralist, is that constant abnegation of\r\nall selfish feelings, that habitual sacrifice of every personal,\r\nevery party consideration to the single object of strict duty--duty\r\nrigorously performed in what station soever he might be called to act.\r\nThis was ever perceived to be his distinguishing quality; and it was\r\ndisplayed at every period of his public life, and in all matters from\r\nthe most trifling to the most important.”\r\n\r\nRegarding the Reform Bill, Brougham says that Wellington’s conduct\r\n“during the whole of the debates in both sessions upon that measure was\r\nexemplary. Opposing it to the utmost of his power, no one could charge\r\nhim with making the least approach to factious violence, or with ever\r\ntaking an unfair advantage.... After the Bill had passed, the same\r\nabsence of all factious feelings marked his conduct.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke’s modesty, his good sense, candour and fairness, love of\r\njustice, hatred of oppression and fraud are touched upon by Brougham,\r\nwho closes his brief acknowledgment of his subject’s virtues by quoting\r\na remark made by Lord Denman, “the greatest judge of the day.” It is\r\nthat of all Wellington’s “great and good qualities, the one which\r\nstands first, is his anxious desire ever to see justice done, and the\r\npain he manifestly feels from the sight of injustice.”\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 14th September 1852 the victor of Waterloo had a\r\nparalytic stroke at Walmer Castle. At six o’clock his valet entered the\r\nDuke’s room to call him, but he complained of not feeling quite well\r\nand sent for an apothecary. In the evening he was lying dead on his\r\ncamp bedstead. We are apt to use the phrase “full of years and honour”\r\nrather too glibly perhaps, but it is intensely apposite when applied\r\nto the great Duke. He was eighty-three years of age, and as for honour\r\na glance at the following list of distinctions bestowed upon Arthur\r\nWellesley will make the fact self evident:\r\n\r\nHe was Duke of Wellington, Marquis of Wellington, Earl of Wellington\r\nin Somerset, Viscount Wellington of Talavera, Marquis of Douro, Baron\r\nDouro of Wellesley, Prince of Waterloo in the Netherlands, Duke of\r\nCiudad Rodrigo in Spain, Duke of Bennoy in France, Duke of Vittoria,\r\nMarquis of Torres Vedras, Count of Vimiero in Portugal, a Grandee of\r\nthe First Class in Spain, a Privy Councillor, Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe British Army, Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, Colonel of the\r\nRifle Brigade, a Field Marshal of Great Britain, a Marshal of Russia,\r\nAustria, Prussia, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands; a Knight of the\r\nGarter, the Holy Ghost, the Golden Fleece; a Knight Grand Cross of the\r\nBath and of Hanover, a Knight of the Black Eagle, the Tower and Sword,\r\nSt Fernando, of William of the Low Countries, Charles III, of the\r\nSword of Sweden, St Andrew of Russia, the Annunciado of Sardinia, the\r\nElephant of Denmark, of Maria Theresa, of St George of Russia, of the\r\nCrown of Rue of Saxony; a Knight of Fidelity of Baden, of Maximilian\r\nJoseph of Bavaria, of St Alexander Newsky of Russia, of St Hermenegilda\r\nof Spain, of the Red Eagle of Bradenburg, of St Januarius, of the\r\nGolden Lion of Hesse Cassel, of the Lion of Baden; and a Knight of\r\nMerit of Würtemburg. In addition, Wellington was Lord High Constable of\r\nEngland, Constable of the Tower and of Dover Castle, Warden, Chancellor\r\nand Admiral of the Cinque Ports, Lord-Lieutenant of Hampshire and\r\nof the Tower Hamlets, Ranger of St James’s Park and of Hyde Park,\r\nChancellor of the University of Oxford, Commissioner of the Royal\r\nMilitary College, Vice-President of the Scottish Naval and Military\r\nAcademy, the Master of Trinity House, a Governor of King’s College, a\r\nDoctor of Laws, and a Fellow of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nThe motto on Wellington’s escutcheon, _Virtutis fortuna\r\ncomes_--“Fortune is the companion of valour”--was exemplified in his\r\nlong and eventful career, and perhaps the following words, once used by\r\nhim in a dispatch, suggest how keen was his sense of responsibility:\r\n“God help me if I fail, for no one else will.” With true British\r\ninconsistency the nation spent £100,000 on the funeral of him whose\r\nhabits were of Spartan simplicity, but with more appropriateness the\r\nbody of the Conqueror of Napoleon was placed next to that of the Hero\r\nof Trafalgar in the crypt of St Paul’s Cathedral.\r\n\r\nAnd so these two great Warriors sleep together. They were worthy of\r\nEngland; may England be worthy of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex of Proper Names\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbé Siéyès, 21\r\n\r\n  Abercromby, General, 30, 47\r\n\r\n  Abrantes, 109,

Supposing Arthur Wellesley was born on the\r\n1st May (new style), that date would be the 18th April (old style), and\r\nthe 30th April (old style) the 12th May according to the present way of\r\nreckoning.\r\n\r\n[2] It must be remembered that Barrington wrote from the point of view\r\nof a “patriot,” and that Castlereagh had much to do with the Union of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland. Castlereagh entered the Irish Parliament in\r\n1790, served in the Pitt, Addington, Perceval, and Portland ministries,\r\nwas present at the Congress of Vienna, and died by his own hand in 1822.\r\n\r\n[3] Dumouriez was in London from the 12th June until the 22nd, 1793. He\r\nlived in England from October 1803 until his death on the 14th March\r\n1823.\r\n\r\n[4] Similar incidents occurred during the Peninsular War.\r\n\r\n[5] At Arnheim, on the Rhine, less than twenty-five miles distant.\r\nAccording to the de Ros MS., consulted by Sir Herbert Maxwell, Dundas\r\npaid a visit to Wellesley “about once a fortnight.”\r\n\r\n[6] Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, 1794-8.\r\n\r\n[7] Letter to Sir Chichester Fortescue, dated 20th June 1796, cited by\r\nSir Herbert Maxwell, vol. i. p. 19 n.\r\n\r\n[8] Sir Herbert Maxwell, p. 35.\r\n\r\n[9] Gleig (p. 26) says £7000, Roberts (p. 11) £7000 in money and £1200\r\nin jewels. Sir Herbert Maxwell (p. 39) calls attention to a letter,\r\ndated the 14th June 1799, in which Wellesley “gives it as 3000 pagodas\r\nin jewels, and 7000 in money; in all, 10,000 pagodas, equal to about\r\n£4000.”\r\n\r\n[10] In later years Wellington offered to provide for the unfortunate\r\nSpanish general, Alava, and gave him a small house in the park of\r\nStrathfieldsaye.\r\n\r\n[11] Created 20th December 1800.\r\n\r\n[12] The Austrian general, Kray, had succeeded Archduke Charles as\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the army in Germany in the campaign of 1800, but\r\nowing to his ill-success he was superseded in a few months by Archduke\r\nJohn, hence Wellesley’s reference.\r\n\r\n[13] “The Life of Wellington,” pp. 45-6.\r\n\r\n[14] “Dispatches,” vol. ii. p. 312.\r\n\r\n[15] “The Life of Arthur Duke of Wellington,” by G. R.

When Sir James Mackintosh sailed from Portsmouth for Bombay in\r\n1804 his vessel only occupied three months and thirteen days (see his\r\n“Memoirs,” vol. i. p. 207).\r\n\r\n[20] “His relationship to the Governor-General naturally lent much\r\nweight to his views with Lord Clive and General Harris, but,” Sir\r\nHerbert Maxwell adds (p. 24), “it is remarkable how freely and\r\nfrequently the elder brother sought the younger’s advice.”\r\n\r\n[21] “The Life and Correspondence of the Right Honble.

It will be remembered that at the time\r\nof the Russian-Japanese war, newspaper men were wisely precluded from\r\npublishing particulars of proposed movements and similar intelligence\r\nlikely to be of service to the enemy. During the recent conflict\r\nbetween Italy and Turkey the most rigid censorship was exercised by the\r\nformer Power.\r\n\r\n[48] “I rather think that Mortier had removed from Zaragoza; but some\r\ntime elapsed before he arrived in Old Castile.”--Note by Wellesley.\r\n\r\n[49] “The Adventures of a Soldier,” by Edward Costello.\r\n\r\n[50] Oman, vol. ii. p. 334. This disposes of the often-repeated story\r\nthat Waters discovered the little craft in the reeds. Brailmont, for\r\ninstance, says that the Colonel “suddenly darted off from the throng,”\r\nand half an hour later the skiff “shot out into the deep” with six men\r\non board.\r\n\r\n[51] At the approach of the enemy no fewer than 6000 Spaniards took to\r\ntheir heels and played no part in the battle.\r\n\r\n[52] Napoleon made a similar error of judgment at Waterloo by keeping\r\nthe Imperial Guard in reserve until after 7 p.m. (See _post_, p. 222).\r\n\r\n[53] Sir Herbert Maxwell, vol. i. p. 165, says 6268; Professor Oman\r\n(“Cambridge Modern History,” vol. ix. p. 452) gives 5300, the Spanish\r\ncasualties “trifling.” The latter authority states that 7200 Frenchmen\r\nwere killed or wounded.\r\n\r\n[54] “Passages in the Early Military Life of General Sir George T.\r\nNapier, K.C.B.” (London, 1884), pp. 111-12.\r\n\r\n[55] See _post_, p. 130.\r\n\r\n[56] “Cambridge Modern History,” vol. ix. p. 455. This authority gives\r\nthe date of the battle of Tamames as the 18th October, but Wellington\r\nstates that it occurred on the 19th.--See “Dispatches,” vol. v. pp. 261\r\nand 350.\r\n\r\n[57] Its object was to destroy the ships and dockyards at Antwerp.\r\n\r\n[58] General Sir George T. Napier, pp. 120-21.\r\n\r\n[59] Really his two reserve divisions, consisting of some 8000 men. See\r\nOman, vol. iii. p. 432, and _post_, p. 139.\r\n\r\n[60] September 1810.\r\n\r\n[61] On the 27th September 1910, the centenary of the battle, an\r\nanniversary banquet was given at Busaco, which was attended by\r\nWellington’s grandson. King Manoel--now dethroned--signed a decree\r\nreaffirming the duke’s Portuguese titles of Duke of Vittoria, Marquis\r\nof Torres Vedras, and Count of Vimiero. Celebrations were also held on\r\nthe site of the battle.\r\n\r\n[62] The writer is speaking literally.\r\n\r\n[63] The usual French mode of attack.\r\n\r\n[64] Not Marshal Soult, but his nephew.\r\n\r\n[65] The Proclamation is printed in full in Gurwood’s edition of\r\n“Wellington’s Dispatches,” vol. vii. pp. 455-7.\r\n\r\n[66] Lady Butler’s picture, “Steady, the Drums and Fifes,” represents\r\nthis regiment drawn up on the ridge.\r\n\r\n[67] He had recently received reinforcements from England.\r\n\r\n[68] Napoleon dominated practically the whole of Northern Europe.\r\nHe was then planning a confederacy which was to consist of Sweden,\r\nDenmark, and the Grand Duchy of Warsaw.\r\n\r\n[69] Wellington’s instructions to Hill will be found in “Dispatches,”\r\nvol. viii. pp. 180-82.\r\n\r\n[70] “Cambridge Modern History,” vol. ix. p. 469.\r\n\r\n[71] _i.e._ The province of Leon, in which Ciudad Rodrigo is situated.\r\n\r\n[72] “Autobiography,” pp. 64-5.\r\n\r\n[73] Sir Herbert Maxwell, vol. i. p. 280.\r\n\r\n[74] A monument to the memory of Major-General Gaspard Le Marchant is\r\nin St Paul’s Cathedral.\r\n\r\n[75] It is given in Gurwood, vol. x. pp. 61-66.\r\n\r\n[76] Lützen was fought on the 3rd May 1813, and Bautzen on the 20th\r\nand 21st May. In both battles the Prussians and Russians, who at the\r\nopening of the Leipzig campaign bore all the fighting for the Allies,\r\nwere defeated. The only result of the armistice was that Austria threw\r\nin her lot with Russia, Prussia, and Sweden.--See the author’s “Story\r\nof Napoleon,” pp. 296-299.\r\n\r\n[77] “Personal Reminiscences of the Duke of Wellington by Francis, the\r\nfirst Earl of Ellesmere,” p. 129.
