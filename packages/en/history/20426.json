RUSSELL,\r\nM.A., B.Sc., F.Z.S.\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATED\r\n\r\nLONDON\r\n\r\nJOHN MURRAY, ALBEMARLE STREET, W.\r\n\r\n1916\r\n\r\n_All rights reserved_\r\n\r\n+---------------------------------------+\r\n| Transcriber's Note: Obvious printer   |\r\n| errors have been corrected, all other |\r\n| inconsistencies in spelling and       |\r\n| punctuation are as in the original.   |\r\n+---------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is not intended to be a full or detailed history of animal\r\nmorphology: a complete account is given neither of morphological\r\ndiscoveries nor of morphological theories. My aim has been rather to\r\ncall attention to the existence of diverse typical attitudes to the\r\nproblems of form, and to trace the interplay of the theories that have\r\narisen out of them.\r\n\r\nThe main currents of morphological thought are to my mind three--the\r\nfunctional or synthetic, the formal or transcendental, and the\r\nmaterialistic or disintegrative.\r\n\r\nThe first is associated with the great names of Aristotle, Cuvier, and\r\nvon Baer, and leads easily to the more open vitalism of Lamarck and\r\nSamuel Butler. The typical representative of the second attitude is E.\r\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire, and this habit of thought has greatly influenced\r\nthe development of evolutionary morphology.\r\n\r\nThe main battle-ground of these two opposing tendencies is the problem\r\nof the relation of function to form. Is function the mechanical result\r\nof form, or is form merely the manifestation of function or activity?\r\nWhat is the essence of life--organisation or activity?\r\n\r\nThe materialistic attitude is not distinctively biological, but is\r\ncommon to practically all fields of thought. It dates back to the\r\nGreek atomists, and the triumph of mechanical science in the 19th\r\ncentury has induced many to accept materialism as the only possible\r\nscientific method. In biology it is more akin to the formal than to\r\nthe functional attitude.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this book I have not hidden my own sympathy with the\r\nfunctional attitude. It appears to me probable that more insight will\r\nbe gained into the real nature of life and organisation by\r\nconcentrating on the active response of the animal, as manifested both\r\nin behaviour and in morphogenesis, particularly in the post-embryonic\r\nstages, than by giving attention exclusively to the historical aspect\r\nof structure, as is the custom of \"pure morphology.\" I believe we\r\nshall only make progress in this direction if we frankly adopt the\r\nsimple everyday conception of living things--which many of us have had\r\ndrilled out of us--that they are active, purposeful agents, not mere\r\ncomplicated aggregations of protein and other substances. Such an\r\nattitude is probably quite as sound philosophically as the opposing\r\none, but I have not in this place attempted any justification of it. I\r\nhave touched very lightly upon the controversy between vitalism and\r\nmaterialism which has been revived with the early years of the present\r\ncentury. It hardly lends itself as yet to historical treatment, and I\r\ncould hardly hope to maintain with regard to it that objective\r\nattitude which should characterise the historian.\r\n\r\nThe main result I hope to have achieved with this book is the\r\ndemonstration, tentative and incomplete as it is, of the essential\r\ncontinuity of animal morphology from the days of Aristotle down to our\r\nown time. It is unfortunately true that modern biology, perhaps in\r\nconsequence of the great advances it has made in certain directions,\r\nhas to a considerable extent lost its historical consciousness, and if\r\nthis book helps in any degree to counteract this tendency so far as\r\nanimal morphology is concerned, it will have served its purpose.\r\n\r\nI owe a debt of gratitude to my friends Dr James F. Gemmill and Prof.\r\nJ. Arthur Thomson for much kindly encouragement and helpful criticism.\r\nThe credit for the illustrations is due to my wife, Mrs Jehanne A.\r\nRussell.

His\r\ninterests appear to have been rather physiological than anatomical. He\r\ntraced the chief nerves of sense to the brain, which he considered to\r\nbe the seat of the soul, and he made some good guesses at the\r\nmechanism of the organs of special sense. He showed that, contrary to\r\nthe received opinion, the seminal fluid did not originate in the\r\nspinal cord. Two comparisons are recorded of his, one that puberty is\r\nthe equivalent of the flowering time in plants, the other that milk is\r\nthe equivalent of white of egg.[1] Both show his bias towards looking\r\nat the functional side of living things. The latter comparison\r\nreappears in Aristotle.\r\n\r\nA century later Diogenes of Apollonia gave a description of the venous\r\nsystem. He too placed the seat of sensation in the brain. He assumed a\r\nvital air in all living things, being in this influenced by Anaximenes\r\nwhose primitive matter was infinite air. In following out this thought\r\nhe tried to prove that both fishes and oysters have the power of\r\nbreathing.[2]\r\n\r\nA more strictly morphological note is struck by a curious saying of\r\nEmpedocles (4th century B.C.), that \"hair and foliage and the thick\r\nplumage of birds are one.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIn the collected writings of Hippocrates and his school, the _Corpus\r\nHippocraticum_, of which no part is later than the end of the 5th\r\ncentury, there are recorded many anatomical facts. The author of the\r\ntreatise \"On the Muscles\" knew, for instance, that the spinal marrow\r\nis different from ordinary marrow and has membranes continuous with\r\nthose of the brain. Embryos of seven days (!) have all the parts of\r\nthe body plainly visible. Work on comparative embryology is contained\r\nin the treatise \"On the Development of the Child.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThe author of the treatise \"On the Joints,\" which Littre calls \"the\r\ngreat surgical monument of antiquity,\" is to be credited with the\r\nfirst systematic attempt at comparative anatomy, for he compared the\r\nhuman skeleton with that of other Vertebrates.\r\n\r\nAristotle (384-322 B.C.)[5] may fairly be said to be the founder of\r\ncomparative anatomy, not because he was specially interested in\r\nproblems of \"pure morphology,\" but because he described the structure\r\nof many animals and classified them in a scientific way. We shall\r\ndiscuss here the morphological ideas which occur in his writings upon\r\nanimals--in the _Historia Animialium_, the _De Partibus Animalium_,\r\nand the _De Generatione Animalium_.\r\n\r\nThe _Historia Animalium_ is a most comprehensive work, in some ways\r\nthe finest text-book of Zoology ever written. Certainly few modern\r\ntext-books take such a broad and sane view of living creatures.\r\nAristotle never forgets that form and structure are but one of the\r\nmany properties of living things; he takes quite as much interest in\r\ntheir behaviour, their ecology, distribution, comparative physiology.\r\nHe takes a special interest in the comparative physiology of\r\nreproduction. The _Historia Animalium_ contains a description of the\r\nform and structure of man and of as many animals as Aristotle was\r\nacquainted with--and he was acquainted with an astonishingly large\r\nnumber. The later _De Partibus Animalium_ is a treatise on the causes\r\nof the form and structure of animals. Owing to the importance which\r\nAristotle ascribed to the final cause this work became really a\r\ntreatise on the functions of the parts, a discussion of the problems\r\nof the relation of form to function, and the adaptedness of structure.\r\n\r\nAristotle was quite well aware that each of the big groups of animals\r\nwas built upon one plan of structure, which showed endless variations\r\n\"in excess and defect\" in the different members of the group. But he\r\ndid not realise that this fact of community of plan constituted a\r\nproblem in itself. His interest was turned towards the functional side\r\nof living things, form was for him a secondary result of function.\r\n\r\nYet he was not unaware of facts of form for which he could not quite\r\nfind a place in his theory of organic form, facts of form which were\r\nnot, at first sight at least, facts of function. Thus he was aware of\r\ncertain facts of \"correlation,\" which could not be explained off-hand\r\nas due to correlation of the functions of the parts. He knew, for\r\ninstance, that all animals without front teeth in the upper jaw have\r\ncotyledons, while most that have front teeth on both jaws and no horns\r\nhave no cotyledons (_De Gen._, ii. 7).\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, however, we find in Aristotle no purely\r\nmorphological concepts. What then does morphology owe to Aristotle? It\r\nowes to him, _first_, a great mass of facts about the structure of\r\nanimals; _second_, the first scientific classification of animals;[6]\r\n_third_, a clear enunciation of the fact of community of plan within\r\neach of the big groups; _fourth_, an attempt to explain certain\r\ninstances of the correlation of parts; _fifth_, a pregnant distinction\r\nbetween homogeneous and heterogeneous parts; _sixth_, a generalisation\r\non the succession of forms in development; and _seventh_, the first\r\nenunciation of the idea of the _Echelle des etres_.\r\n\r\n(1) What surprises the modern reader of the _Historia Animalium_\r\nperhaps more than anything else is the extent and variety of\r\nAristotle's knowledge of animals. He describes more than 500 kinds.[7]\r\nNot only does he know the ordinary beasts, birds, and fishes with\r\nwhich everyone is acquainted, but he knows a great deal about\r\ncuttlefish, snails and oysters, about crabs, crawfish (_Palinurus_),\r\nlobsters, shrimps, and hermit crabs, about sea-urchins and starfish,\r\nsea-anemones and sponges, about ascidians (which seem to have puzzled\r\nhim not a little!). He has noticed even fish-lice and intestinal\r\nworms, both flat and round. Of the smaller land animals, he knows a\r\ngreat many insects and their larvae. The extent of his anatomical\r\nknowledge is equally surprising, and much of it is clearly the result\r\nof personal observation. No one can read his account of the internal\r\nanatomy of the chameleon (_Hist. Anim._, ii.), or his description of\r\nthe structure of cuttlefish (_Hist. Anim._, iv), or that touch in the\r\ndescription of the hermit crab (_Hist. Anim._, iv.)--\" Two large eyes\r\n... not ... turned on one side like those of crabs, but straight\r\nforward\"--without being convinced that Aristotle is speaking of what\r\nhe has seen. Naturally he could not make much of the anatomy of small\r\ninsects and snails, and, to tell the truth, he does not seem to have\r\ncared greatly about the minutiae of structure. He was too much of a\r\nGreek and an aristocrat to care about laborious detail.\r\n\r\nNot only did he lay a foundation for comparative anatomy, but he made\r\na real start with comparative embryology. Medical men before him had\r\nknown many facts about human development; Aristotle seems to have been\r\nthe first to study in any detail the development of the chick. He\r\ndescribes this as it appears to the naked eye, the position of the\r\nembryo on the yolk, the palpitating spot at the third day, the\r\nformation of the body and of the large sightless eyes, the veins on\r\nthe yolk, the embryonic membranes, of which he distinguished two.\r\n\r\n(2) Aristotle had various systems of classifying animals. They could\r\nbe classified, he thought, according to their structure, their manner\r\nof reproduction, their manner of life, their mode of locomotion, their\r\nfood, and so on. Thus you might, in addition to structural\r\nclassifications, divide animals into gregarious, solitary and social,\r\nor land animals into troglodytes, surface-dwellers, and burrowers\r\n(_Hist. Anim._, i.).\r\n\r\nHe knew that dichotomous classifications were of little use for\r\nanimals (_De Partibus_, i. 3) and he explicitly and in so many words\r\naccepted the principle of all \"natural\" classification, that\r\naffinities must be judged by comparing not one but the sum total of\r\ncharacters. As everyone knows, he was the first to distinguish the big\r\ngroups of animals, many of which were already distinguished roughly by\r\nthe common usages of speech. Among his Sanguinea he did little more\r\nthan define with greater exactitude the limits of the groups\r\nestablished by the popular classification. Among the \"exsanguineous\"\r\nanimals, however, corresponding to our Invertebrates, he established a\r\nmuch more definite classification than the popular, which is apt to\r\ncall them indiscriminately \"shellfish,\" \"insects,\" or \"creeping\r\nthings.\" He went beyond the superficialities of popular\r\nclassification, too, in clearly separating Cetacea from fishes. He had\r\nsome notion of species and genera in our sense. He distinguished many\r\nspecies of cuttlefish--_Octopus (Polypus)_ of which there were many\r\nkinds, _Eledone (Moschites)_ which he knew to have only one row of\r\nsuckers while _Octopus_ has two, _Argonauta, Nautilus, Sepia_, and\r\napparently _Loligo media_ (= his Teuthis) and _L. vulgaris_(or\r\n_forbesii_) which seems to be his Teuthos. He had a grasp of the\r\nprinciples which should be followed in judging of the natural\r\naffinities of species. For example, he knew that the cuckoo resembles\r\na hawk. \"But,\" he says, \"the hawk has crooked talons, which the cuckoo\r\nhas not, nor does it resemble the hawk in the form of its head, but in\r\nthese respects is more like the pigeon than the hawk, which it\r\nresembles in nothing but its colour; the markings, however, upon the\r\nhawk are like lines, while the cuckoo is spotted\" (_Hist. Anim._,\r\nCresswell's trans., p. 147, London, 1862).\r\n\r\nThe groups he distinguished were--man, viviparous quadrupeds,\r\noviparous quadrupeds, birds, fishes, Cetacea, Cephalopoda,\r\nMalacostraca (= higher Crustacea), Insecta (= annulose animals),\r\nTestacea (= molluscs, echinoderms, ascidians). A class of Acalephae,\r\nincluding sea-anemones and sponges, was grouped with the Testacea. The\r\nfirst five groups were classed together as sanguineous, the others as\r\nexsanguineous, from the presence or absence of red blood.\r\n\r\nBesides these classes \"there are,\" he says, \"many other creatures in\r\nthe sea which it is not possible to arrange in any class from their\r\nscarcity\" (Creswell, _loc. cit._, p. 90).\r\n\r\n(3) Aristotle's greatest service to morphology is his clear\r\nrecognition of the unity of plan holding throughout each of the great\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nHe recognises this most clearly in the case of man and the viviparous\r\nquadrupeds, with whose structure he was best acquainted. In the\r\n_Historia Animalium_ he takes man as a standard, and describes his\r\nexternal and internal parts in detail, then considers viviparous\r\nquadrupeds and compares them with man. \"Whatever parts a man has\r\nbefore, a quadruped has beneath; those that are behind in man form the\r\nquadruped's back\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 26). Apes, monkeys, and\r\nCynocephali combine the characteristics of man and quadrupeds. He\r\nnotices that all viviparous quadrupeds have hair. Oviparous quadrupeds\r\nresemble the viviparous, but they lack some organs, such as ears with\r\nan external pinna, mammae, hair. Oviparous bipeds, or birds, also \"have\r\nmany parts like the animals described above.\" He does not, however,\r\nseem to realise that a bird's wings are the equivalent of a mammal's\r\narms or fore-legs. Fishes are much more divergent; they possess no\r\nneck, nor limbs, nor testicles (meaning a solid ovoid body such as the\r\ntestis in mammals), nor mammae. Instead of hair they have scales.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, the Sanguinea differ from man and from one another\r\nin their parts, which may be present or absent, or exhibit differences\r\nin \"excess and defect,\" or in form. Unity of plan extends to all the\r\nprincipal systems of organs. \"All sanguineous animals have either a\r\nbony or a spinous column. The remainder of the bones exist in some\r\nanimals; but not in others, for if they have the limbs they have the\r\nbones belonging to them\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 60). \"Viviparous\r\nanimals with blood and feet do not differ much in their bones, but\r\nrather by analogy, in hardness, softness, and size\" (Cresswell, _loc.\r\ncit._, p. 59). The venous system, too, is built upon the same general\r\nplan throughout the Sanguinea. \"In all sanguineous animals, the nature\r\nand origin of the principal veins are the same, but the multitude of\r\nsmaller veins is not alike in all, for neither are the parts of the\r\nsame nature, nor do all possess the same parts\" (Cresswell, _loc.\r\ncit._, p. 56). It will be noticed in the first and last of these three\r\nquotations that Aristotle recognises the fact of correlation between\r\nsystems of organs,--between limbs and bones, and between blood-vessels\r\nand the parts to which they go.\r\n\r\nSanguineous animals all possess certain organs--heart, liver, spleen,\r\nkidneys, and so on. Other organs occur in most of the classes--the\r\noesophagus and the lungs. \"The position which these parts occupy is\r\nthe same in all animals [sc. Sanguinea]\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p.\r\n39).\r\n\r\nUnity of plan is observable not only in the Sanguinea, but also within\r\neach of the other large groups. Aristotle recognises that all his\r\ncuttlefish are alike in structure. Among his Malacostraca he compares\r\npoint by point the external parts of the carabus (_Palinurus_), and\r\nthe astacus (_Homarus_), and he compares also the general internal\r\nanatomy of the various \"genera\" he distinguishes. As regards Testacea,\r\nhe writes, \"The nature of their internal structure is similar in all,\r\nespecially in the turbinated animals, for they differ in size and in\r\nthe relations of excess; the univalves and bivalves do not exhibit\r\nmany differences\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 83). There is an\r\ninteresting remark about \"the creature called carcinium\"\r\n(hermit-crab), that it \"resembles both the Malacostraca and the\r\nTestacea, for this in its nature is similar to the animals that are\r\nlike carabi, and it is born naked\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 85). In\r\nthe last phrase we may perhaps read the first recognition of the\r\nembryological criterion.\r\n\r\nWith the recognition of unity of plan within each group necessarily\r\ngoes the recognition of what later morphology calls the homology of\r\nparts. The parts of a horse can be compared one by one with the parts\r\nof another viviparous quadruped; in all the animals belonging to the\r\nsame class the parts are the same, only they differ in excess or\r\ndefect--these remarks are placed in the forefront of the _Historia\r\nAnimalium_. Generally speaking, parts which bear the same name are for\r\nAristotle homologous throughout the class. But he goes further and\r\nnotes the essential resemblance underlying the differences of certain\r\nparts. He classes together nails and claws, the spines of the\r\nhedgehog, and hair, as being homologous structures. He says that teeth\r\nare allied to bones, whereas horns are more nearly allied to skin\r\n(_Hist. Anim._, iii.). This is an astonishingly happy guess,\r\nconsidering that all he had to go upon was the observation that in\r\nblack animals the horns are black but the teeth white. One cannot but\r\nadmire the way in which Aristotle fixes upon apparently trivial and\r\ncommonplace facts, and draws from them far-reaching consequences. He\r\noften goes wrong, it is true, but he always errs in the grand manner.\r\n\r\nWhile Aristotle certainly recognised the existence of homologies, and\r\neven had a feeling for them, he did not clearly distinguish homology\r\nfrom analogy. He comes pretty near the distinction in the following\r\npassage. After explaining that in animals belonging to the same class\r\nthe parts are the same, differing only in excess or defect, he says,\r\n\"But some animals agree with each other in their parts neither in form\r\nnor in excess and defect, but have only an analogous likeness, such as\r\na bone bears to a spine, a nail to a hoof, a hand to a crab's claw,\r\nthe scale of a fish to the feather of a bird, for that which is a\r\nfeather in the bird is a scale in the fish\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._,\r\np. 2). One of these comparisons is, however, a homology not an\r\nanalogy, and the last phrase throws a little doubt upon the whole\r\nquestion, for it is not made clear whether it is position or function\r\nthat determines what are equivalent organs.\r\n\r\nIn the _De Partibus Animalium_ there occurs the following\r\npassage:--\"Groups that only differ in degree, and in the more or less\r\nof an identical element that they possess, are aggregated under a\r\nsingle class; groups whose attributes are not identical but analogous\r\nare separated. For instance, bird differs from bird by gradation, or\r\nby excess and defect; some birds have long feathers, others short\r\nones, but all are feathered. Bird and Fish are more remote and only\r\nagree in having analogous organs; for what in the bird is feather, in\r\nthe fish is scale. Such analogies can scarcely, however, serve\r\nuniversally as indications for the formation of groups, for almost all\r\nanimals present analogies in their corresponding parts.\"[8] It is thus\r\nsimilarity in form and structure which determines the formation of the\r\nmain groups. Within each group the parts differ only in degree, in\r\nlargeness or smallness, softness and hardness, smoothness or\r\nroughness, and the like (_loc. cit._, i., 4, 644^b). These passages\r\nshow that Aristotle had some conception of homology as distinct from\r\nanalogy. He did not, however, develop the idea. What Aristotle sought\r\nin the variety of animal structure, and what he found, were not\r\nhomologies, but rather communities of function, parts with the same\r\nattributes. His interest was all in _organs_, in functioning parts,\r\nnot in the mere spatial relationship of parts.\r\n\r\nThis comes out clearly in his treatise _On the Parts of Animals_,\r\nwhich is subsequent to, and the complement of, his _History of\r\nAnimals_. The latter is a description of the variety of animal form,\r\nthe former is a treatise on the functions of the parts. He describes\r\nthe plan of the _De Partibus Animalium_ as follows:--\"We have, then,\r\nfirst to describe the common functions, common, that is, to the whole\r\nanimal kingdom, or to certain large groups, or to members of a\r\nspecies. In other words, we have to describe the attributes common to\r\nall animals, or to assemblages, like the class of Birds, of closely\r\nallied groups differentiated by gradation, or to groups like Man not\r\ndifferentiated into subordinate groups. In the first case the common\r\nattributes may be called analogous, in the second generic, in the\r\nthird specific\" (i, 5, 645^b, trans. Ogle). The alimentary canal is a\r\ngood example of a part which is \"analogous\" throughout the animal\r\nkingdom, for \"all animals possess in common those parts by which they\r\ntake in food, and into which they receive it\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._,\r\np. 6).\r\n\r\nThe _De Partibus Animalium_ becomes in form a comparative\r\norganography, but the emphasis is always on function and community of\r\nfunction. Thus he treats of bone, \"fish-spine,\" and cartilage together\r\n(_De Partibus_, ii., 9, 655^a), because they have the same function,\r\nthough he says elsewhere that they are only analogous structures (ii.,\r\n8, 653^b). In the same connection he describes also the supporting\r\ntissues of Invertebrates--the hard exoskeleton of Crustacea and\r\nInsects, the shell of Testacea, the \"bone\" of _Sepia_ (ii., 8,\r\n654^a). Aristotle took much more interest in analogies, in organs of\r\nsimilar function, than in homologies. He did recognise the existence\r\nof homologies, but rather _malgre lui_, because the facts forced it\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nHis only excursion into the realm of \"transcendental anatomy\" is his\r\ncomparison of a Cephalopod to a doubled-up Vertebrate whose legs have\r\nbecome adherent to its head, whose alimentary canal has doubled upon\r\nitself in such a way as to bring the anus near the mouth (_De\r\nPartibus_, iv., 9, 684^b). It is clear, however, that Aristotle did\r\nnot seek to establish by this comparison any true homologies of parts,\r\nbut merely analogies, thus avoiding the error into which Meyranx and\r\nLaurencet fell more than two thousand years later in their paper\r\ncommunicated to the Academie des Sciences, which formed the\r\nstarting-point of the famous controversy between Cuvier and E.\r\nGeoffroy St Hilaire (see Chap. V., below).\r\n\r\nMoreover, Aristotle did not so much compare a Cephalopod with a\r\ndoubled-up Vertebrate as contrast Cephalopods (and also Testacea) with\r\nall other animals. Other animals have their organs in a straight line;\r\nCephalopods and Testacea alone show this peculiar doubling up of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n(4) Aristotle was much struck with certain facts of correlation, of\r\nthe interdependence of two organs which are not apparently in\r\nfunctional dependence on one another. Such correlation may be positive\r\nor negative; the presence of one organ may either entail the presence\r\nof the other, or it may entail its absence. Aristotle has various ways\r\nof explaining facts of correlation. He observed that no animal has\r\nboth tusks and horns, but this fact could easily be explained on the\r\nprinciple that Nature never makes anything superfluous or in vain. If\r\nan animal is protected by the possession of tusks it does not require\r\nhorns, and _vice versa_. The correlation of a multiple stomach with\r\ndeficient development of the teeth (as in Ruminants) is accounted for\r\nby saying that the animal needs its complex stomach to make up for the\r\nshortcomings of its teeth! (_De Partibus_, iii., 14, 674^b.) Other\r\nexamples of correlation were not susceptible of this explanation in\r\nterms of final causes. He lays stress on the fact, in the main true,\r\nof the inverse development of horns and front teeth in the upper jaw,\r\nexemplified in Ruminants. He explains the fact in this way. Teeth and\r\nhorns are formed from earthy matter in the body and there is not\r\nenough to form both teeth and horns, so \"Nature by subtracting from\r\nthe teeth adds to the horns; the nutriment which in most animals goes\r\nto the former being here spent on the augmentation of the latter\" (_De\r\nPartibus_, iii., 2, 664^a, trans. Ogle). A similar kind of explanation\r\nis offered of the fact that Selachia have cartilage instead of bone,\r\n\"in these Selachia Nature has used all the earthy matter on the skin\r\n[_i.e._, on the placoid scales]; and she is unable to allot to many\r\ndifferent parts one and the same superfluity of material\" (_De\r\nPartibus_, ii., 9, 655^a, trans. Ogle). Speaking generally, \"Nature\r\ninvariably gives to one part what she subtracts from another\" (_loc.\r\ncit._, ii., 14, 658^a).\r\n\r\nThis thought reappears again in the 19th century in E. Geoffroy St\r\nHilaire's _loi de balancement_ and also in Goethe's writings on\r\nmorphology. For Aristotle it meant that Nature was limited by the\r\nnature of her means, that finality was limited by necessity. Thus in\r\nthe larger animals there is an excess of earthy matter, as a necessary\r\nresult of the material nature of the animal; this excess is turned by\r\nNature to good account, but there is not enough to serve both for\r\nteeth and for horns (_loc. cit._, iii., 2, 663^b).\r\n\r\nBut there are other instances of correlation which seem to have taxed\r\neven Aristotle's ingenuity beyond its powers. Thus he knew that all\r\nanimals (meaning viviparous quadrupeds) with no front teeth in the\r\nupper jaw have cotyledons on their foetal membranes, and that most\r\nanimals which have front teeth in both jaws and no horns have no\r\ncotyledons (_De Generatione_, ii., 7). He offers no explanation of\r\nthis, but accepts it as a fact.\r\n\r\nWe may conveniently refer here to one or two other ideas of Aristotle\r\nregarding the causes of form. He makes the profound remark that the\r\npossible range of form of an organ is limited to some extent by its\r\nexisting differentiation. Thus he explains the absence of external\r\n(projecting) ears in birds and reptiles by the fact that their skin is\r\nhard and does not easily take on the form of an external ear (_De\r\nPartibus_, ii, 12). The fact of the inverse correlation is certain;\r\nthe explanation is, though very vague, probably correct.\r\n\r\nIn one passage of the _De Partibus_ Aristotle clearly enunciates the\r\nprinciple of the division of labour, afterwards emphasised by H.\r\nMilne-Edwards. In some insects, he says, the proboscis combines the\r\nfunctions of a tongue and a sting, in others the tongue and the sting\r\nare quite separate. \"Now it is better,\" he goes on, \"that one and the\r\nsame instrument shall not be made to serve several dissimilar ends;\r\nbut that there shall be one organ to serve as a weapon, which can then\r\nbe very sharp, and a distinct one to serve as a tongue, which can then\r\nbe of spongy texture and fit to absorb nutriment. Whenever, therefore,\r\nNature is able to provide two separate instruments for two separate\r\nuses, without the one hampering the other, she does so, instead of\r\nacting like a coppersmith who for cheapness makes a spit and\r\nlampholder in one\" (iv., 6, 683^a).\r\n\r\n(5) The first sentence of the _Historia Animalium_ formulates, with\r\nthat simplicity and directness which is so characteristic of\r\nAristotle, the distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous\r\nparts, in the mass the distinction between tissues and organs. \"Some\r\nparts of animals are simple, and these can be divided into like parts,\r\nas flesh into pieces of flesh; others are compound, and cannot be\r\ndivided into like parts, as the hand cannot be divided into hands, nor\r\nthe face into faces. All the compound parts also are made up of simple\r\nparts--the hand, for example, of flesh and sinew and bone\" (Cresswell,\r\n_loc. cit_., p. I).\r\n\r\nIn the _De Partibus Animalium_ he broadens the conception by adding\r\nanother form of composition. \"Now there are,\" he says, \"three degrees\r\nof composition; and of these the first in order, as all will allow, is\r\ncomposition out of what some call the elements, such as earth, air,\r\nwater, fire.... The second degree of composition is that by which the\r\nhomogeneous parts of animals, such as bone, flesh, and the like, are\r\nconstituted out of the primary substances. The third and last stage is\r\nthe composition which forms the heterogeneous parts, such as face,\r\nhand, and the rest\" (ii., 1, 646^a, trans. Ogle).\r\n\r\nIn the _Historia Animalium_ the homogeneous parts are divided into (1)\r\nthe soft and moist (or fluid), such as blood, serum, flesh, fat, suet,\r\nmarrow, semen, gall, milk, phlegm, faeces and urine, and (2) the hard\r\nand dry (or solid), such as sinew, vein, hair, bone, cartilage, nail,\r\nand horn. It would appear from this enumeration that Aristotle's\r\ndistinction of simple and complex parts does not altogether coincide\r\nwith our distinction of tissues and organs. We should not call vein a\r\ntissue, nor do we include under this heading non-living secretions.\r\nBut in the _De Partibus Animalium_ Aristotle, while still holding to\r\nthe distinction set forth above, is alive to the fact that his simple\r\nparts include several different sorts of substances. He distinguishes\r\namong the homogeneous parts three sets. The first of these comprises\r\nthe tissues out of which the heterogeneous parts are constructed,\r\n_e.g._, flesh and bone; the second set form the nutriment of the\r\nparts, and are invariably fluid; while the third set are the residue\r\nof the second and constitute the residual excretions of the body (ii.,\r\n2, 647^b). He sees clearly the difficulty of calling vein or\r\nblood-vessel a simple part, for while a bloodvessel and a part of it\r\nare both blood-vessel, as we should say vascular tissue, yet a part of\r\na blood-vessel is not a bloodvessel. There is form superadded to\r\nhomogeneity of structure (ii., 2, 647^b). Similarly for the heart and\r\nthe other viscera. \"The heart, like the other viscera, is one of the\r\nhomogeneous parts; for, if cut up, its pieces are homogeneous in\r\nsubstance with each other. But it is at the same time heterogeneous in\r\nvirtue of its definite configuration\" (ii., 1, 647^a, trans. Ogle).\r\n\r\nAristotle, therefore, came very near our conception of tissue. He was\r\nof course not a histologist; he describes not the structure of\r\ntissues, which he could not know, but rather their distribution within\r\nthe organism; his section on the homogeneous parts of Sanguinea\r\n(_Historia Animalium_, iii., second half) is largely a comparative\r\ntopographical anatomy; in it, for instance, he describes the venous\r\nand skeletal systems.\r\n\r\nThis distinction which Aristotle drew plays an important part in all\r\nhis writings on animals, particularly in his theory of development. It\r\nwas a distinction of immense value, and is full of meaning even at the\r\npresent day. No one has ever given a better definition of organ than\r\nis implied in Aristotle's description of the heterogeneous parts--\"The\r\ncapacity of action resides in the compound parts\" (Cresswell, _loc.\r\ncit._, p. 7). The heterogeneous parts were distinguished by the\r\nfaculty of doing something, they were the active or executive parts.\r\nThe homogeneous parts were distinguished mainly by physical characters\r\n(_De Generatione_, i., 18), but certain of them had other than purely\r\nphysical properties, they were the organs of touch (_De Partibus_,\r\nii., 1, 647^a).\r\n\r\n(6) In a passage in the _De Generatione_ (ii, 3) Aristotle says that\r\nthe embryo is an animal before it is a particular animal, that the\r\ngeneral characters appear before the special. This is a foreshadowing\r\nof the essential point in von Baer's law (see Chap. IX. below).\r\n\r\nHe considers also that tissues arise before organs. The homogeneous\r\nparts are anterior genetically to the heterogeneous parts and\r\nposterior to the elementary material (_De Partibus_, ii., 1, 646^b).\r\n\r\n(7) We meet in Aristotle an idea which later acquired considerable\r\nvogue, that of the _Echelle des etres_(or \"scale of beings\"), that\r\norganisms, or even all objects organic or inorganic, can be arranged\r\nin a single ascending series. The idea is a common one; its first\r\nliterary expression is found perhaps in primitive creation-myths, in\r\nwhich inorganic things are created before organic, and plants before\r\nanimals. It may be recognised also in Anaximander's theory that land\r\nanimals arose from aquatic animals, more clearly still in Anaxagoras'\r\ntheory that life took its origin on this globe from vegetable germs\r\nwhich fell to earth with the rain. Anaxagoras considered animals\r\nhigher in the scale than plants, for while the latter participated in\r\npleasure (when they grew) and pain (when they lost their leaves),\r\nanimals had in addition \"Nous.\" In Empedocles' theory of evolution,\r\nthe vegetable world preceded the animal. Plato, in the _Timaeus_,\r\ndescribes the whole organic world as being formed by degradation from\r\nman, who is created first. Man sinks first into woman, then into brute\r\nform, traversing all the stages from the higher to the lower animals,\r\nand becoming finally a plant. This is a reversal of the more usual\r\nnotion, but the idea of gradation is equally present.\r\n\r\nAristotle seems not to have believed in any transformation of species,\r\nbut he saw that Nature passes gradually from inanimate to animate\r\nthings without a clear dividing line. \"The race of plants succeeds\r\nimmediately that of inanimate objects\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p.\r\n94). Within the organic realm the passage from plants to animals is\r\ngradual. Some creatures, for example, the sea-anemones and sponges,\r\nmight belong to either class.\r\n\r\nAristotle recognised also a natural series among the groups of\r\nanimals, a series of increasing complexity of structure. He begins his\r\nstudy of structure with man, who is the most intricate, and then takes\r\nup in turn viviparous and oviparous quadrupeds, then birds, then\r\nfishes. After the Sanguinea he considers the Exsanguinea, and of the\r\nlatter first the most highly organised, the Cephalopods, and last the\r\nsimplest, the lower members of his class of the Testacea. In treating\r\nof generation (in _Hist. Animalium_, v.) he reverses this order. In\r\nthe _De Generatione_ (Book ii., I) there is given another serial\r\narrangement of animals, this time in relation to their manner of\r\nreproduction. There is a gradation, he says, of the following kind:--\r\n\r\n1. Internally viviparous Sanguinea  } producing a perfect\r\n2. Externally viviparous Sanguinea  }       animal.\r\n3. Oviparous Sanguinea--producing a perfect egg.\r\n4. Animals producing an imperfect egg (one which\r\n     increases in size after being laid).\r\n5. Insects, producing a scolex (or grub).\r\n\r\nIn Aristotle's view the gradation of organic forms is the consequence,\r\nnot the cause, of the gradation observable in their activities. Plants\r\nhave no work to do beside nutrition, growth, and reproduction; they\r\npossess only the nutritive soul. Animals possess in addition sensation\r\nand the sensitive or perceptive soul--\"their manner of life differs in\r\ntheir having pleasure in sexual intercourse, in their mode of\r\nparturition and rearing their young\" (_Hist. Anim._, viii., trans.\r\nCresswell, p. 195). Man alone has the rational soul in addition to the\r\ntwo lower kinds.\r\n\r\nAs it is put in the _De Partibus_ (ii., 10, 656^a, trans. Ogle),\r\n\"Plants, again, inasmuch as they are without locomotion, present no\r\ngreat variety in their heterogeneous parts. For, where the functions\r\nare but few, few also are the organs required to effect them....\r\nAnimals, however, that not only live but feel, present a greater\r\nmultiformity of parts, and this diversity is greater in some animals\r\nthan in others, being most varied in those to whose share has fallen\r\nnot mere life but life of high degree. Now such an animal is man.\"\r\n\r\nWith the great exception of Aristotle, the philosophers of Greece and\r\nRome made little contribution to morphological theory. Passing mention\r\nmay be made of the Atomists--Leucippus, Democritus, and their great\r\ndisciple Lucretius, who in his magnificent poem \"De Natura Rerum\" gave\r\nimpassioned expression to the materialistic conception of the\r\nuniverse. But the full effect of materialism upon morphology does not\r\nbecome apparent till the rise of physiology in the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies, and reaches its culmination in the 19th century. The\r\nevolutionary ideas of Lucretius exercised no immediate influence upon\r\nthe development of morphology.\r\n\r\n    [1] E.

Knowledge of the human body was increased not\r\nlong after his death by Herophilus and Erasistratus, but not even\r\nGalen more than four centuries later made any essential additions to\r\nAristotle's anatomy.\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages, particularly after the introduction to Europe\r\nin the 13th century of the Arab texts and commentaries, Aristotle\r\ndominated men's thoughts of Nature. The commentary of Albertus Magnus,\r\nbased upon that of Avicenna, did much to impose Aristotle upon the\r\nlearned world. Albertus seems to have contented himself with following\r\nclosely in the footsteps of his master. There are noted, however, by\r\nBonnier certain improvements made by Albertus on Aristotle's view of\r\nthe seriation of living things. \"He is the first,\" writes Bonnier, \"to\r\ntake the correct view that fungi are lower plants allied to the most\r\nlowly organised animals. From this point there start, for Albertus\r\nMagnus, two series of living creatures, and he regards the plant\r\nseries as culminating in the trees which have well-developed\r\nflowers.\"[9]\r\n\r\nAristotle's influence is predominant also in the work of Edward Wotton\r\n(1492-1555), who in his book _De differentiis animalium_ adopted a\r\nclassification similar to that proposed by Aristotle. He too laid\r\nstress upon the gradation shown from the lower to the higher forms.\r\n\r\nIn the 16th century, two groups of men helped to lay foundations for a\r\nfuture science of comparative anatomy--the great Italian anatomists\r\nVesalius, Fallopius and Fabricius, and the first systematists (though\r\ntheir \"systems\" were little more than catalogues) Rondeletius,\r\nAldrovandus and Gesner.\r\n\r\nThe anatomists, however, took little interest in problems of pure\r\nmorphology; the anatomy of the human body was for them simply the\r\nnecessary preliminary of the discovery of the functions of the\r\nparts--they were quite as much physiologists as anatomists.\r\n\r\nOne of them, Fabricius, made observations on the development of the\r\nchick (1615). Harvey, who was a pupil of Fabricius, likewise published\r\nan account of the embryology of the chick.[10] In his philosophy and\r\nhabit of thought Harvey was a follower of Aristotle. It is worth\r\nnoting that in his _Exercitationes anatomicae de motu cordis_ (1628)\r\nthere is a passage which dimly foreshadows the law of recapitulation\r\nin development which later had so much vogue.[11]\r\n\r\nA stimulating contribution to comparative anatomy was made by\r\nBelon,[12] who published in 1555 a _Histoire de la nature des Oyseaux_,\r\nin which he showed opposite one another a skeleton of a bird and of a\r\nmammal, giving the same names to homologous bones. The anatomy of\r\nanimals other than man was indeed not altogether neglected at this\r\ntime. Coiter (1535-1600) studied the anatomy of Vertebrates,\r\ndiscovering among other things the fibrous structure of the brain.\r\nCarlo Ruini of Bologna wrote in 1598 a book on the anatomy of the\r\nhorse.[13] Somewhat later Severino, professor at Naples, dissected many\r\nanimals and came to the conclusion that they were built upon the same\r\nplan as man.[14] Willis, of Oxford and London, in his _Cerebri Anatome_\r\n(1659) recognised the necessity for comparative study of the structure\r\nof the brain. He found out that the brain of man is very like that of\r\nother mammals, the brain of birds, on the contrary, like that of\r\nfishes![15] He described the anatomy of the oyster and the crayfish. He\r\nhad, however, not much feeling for morphology.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the Jardin des Plantes at Paris in 1626 and the\r\nsubsequent addition to it of a Museum of Natural History and a\r\nmenagerie gave a great impulse to the study of comparative anatomy by\r\nsupplying a rich material for dissection. Advantage was taken of these\r\nfacilities, particularly by Claude Perrault and Duverney.[16] In a\r\nvolume entitled _De la Mecanique des Animaux_, Perrault recognises\r\nclearly the idea of unity of type, and even pushes it too far, seeking\r\nto prove that in plants there exists an arterial system and veins\r\nprovided with valves.[17]\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the 17th century saw the invention of the microscope,\r\nwhich was to have such an enormous influence upon the development of\r\nbiological studies. It did not come into scientific use until well on\r\nin the middle of the century. Just before it came into use Francis\r\nGlisson (1597-1677), an Englishman, gave in the introduction to his\r\ntreatise on the liver an account of the notions then current on the\r\nstructure of organic bodies. He classifies the parts as \"similar\" and\r\n\"organic,\" the former determined by their material, the latter by the\r\nform which they assume. The similar parts are divided into the\r\nsanguineous or rich in blood and the spermatic. Both sets are further\r\nsubdivided according to their physical characters,[18] the latter, for\r\ninstance, into the hard, soft, and tensile tissues. The classification\r\nresembles greatly that propounded by Aristotle, though it is notably\r\ninferior in the details of its working out.\r\n\r\nFor Aristotle, as for all anatomists before the days of the\r\nmicroscope, the tissues were not much more than inorganic substances,\r\ndiffering from one another in texture, in hardness, and other physical\r\nproperties. They possessed indeed properties, such as contractility,\r\nwhich were not inorganic, but as far as their visible structure was\r\nconcerned there was little to raise them above the inorganic level.\r\nThe application of the microscope changed all that, for it revealed in\r\nthe tissues an organic structure as complex in its grade as the gross\r\nand visible structure of the whole organism. Of the four men who first\r\nmade adequate use of the new aid, Malpighi, Hooke, Leeuenhoek, and\r\nSwammerdam, the first-named contributed the most to make current the\r\nnew conceptions of organic structure. He studied in some detail the\r\ndevelopment of the chick. He described the minute structure of the\r\nlungs (1661), demonstrating for the first time, by his discovery of\r\nthe capillaries, the connection of the arteries with the veins. In his\r\nwork, _De viscerum structura_ (1666), he describes the histology of\r\nthe spleen, the kidney, the liver, and the cortex of the brain,\r\nestablishing among other things the fact that the liver was really a\r\nconglomerate gland, and discovering the Malpighian bodies in the\r\nkidney. This work was done on a broad comparative basis. \"Since in the\r\nhigher, more perfect, red-blooded animals, the simplicity of their\r\nstructure is wont to be involved by many obscurities, it is necessary\r\nthat we should approach the subject by the observation of the lower,\r\nimperfect animals.\"[19] So he wrote in the _De viscerum structura_, and\r\naccordingly he studied the liver first in the snail, then in fishes,\r\nreptiles, mammals, and finally man. In the introduction to his\r\n_Anatome plantarum_ (1675), in which he laid the foundations of plant\r\nhistology, he vindicates the comparative method in the following\r\nwords:--\"In the enthusiasm of youth I applied myself to Anatomy, and\r\nalthough I was interested in particular problems, yet I dared to pry\r\ninto them in the higher animals. But since these matters enveloped in\r\npeculiar mystery still lie in obscurity, they require the comparison\r\nof simpler conditions, and so the investigation of insects[20] at once\r\nattracted me; finally, since this also has its own difficulties I\r\napplied my mind to the study of plants, intending after prolonged\r\noccupation with this domain, to retrace my steps by way of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, and get back to my former studies. But perhaps not\r\neven this will be sufficient; since the simpler world of minerals and\r\nthe elements should have been taken first. In this case, however, the\r\nundertaking becomes enormous and far beyond my powers.\"[21] There is\r\nsomething fine in this life of broad outlines, devoted whole-heartedly\r\nto an idea, to a plan of research, which required a lifetime to carry\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAn important histological discovery dating from this time is that of\r\nthe finer structure of muscle, made by Stensen (or Steno) in 1664. He\r\ndescribed the structure of muscle-fibres, resolving them into their\r\nconstituent fibrils.\r\n\r\nTo the microscope we owe not only histology but the comparative\r\nanatomy of the lower animals. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries\r\nthe discovery of structure in the lower animals went on continuously,\r\nas may be read in any history of Zoology.[22] We content ourselves here\r\nwith mentioning only some representative names.\r\n\r\nIn the 17th century Leeuenhoek, applying the microscope almost at\r\nrandom, discovered fact after fact, his most famous, discovery being\r\nthat of the \"spermatic animalcules.\"\r\n\r\nSwammerdam studied the metamorphoses of insects and made wonderfully\r\nminute dissections of all sorts of animals, snails and insects\r\nparticularly. He described also the development of the frog. It is\r\ncurious to see what a grip his conception of metamorphosis had upon\r\nhim when he homologises the stages of the frog's development with the\r\nEgg, the Worm, and the Nymph of insects (_Book of Nature_, p. 104,\r\nEng. trans., 1785). He even speaks of the human embryo as being at a\r\ncertain stage a Man-Vermicle.\r\n\r\nIn the 18th century, Reaumur and Bonnet continued the minute study of\r\ninsects, laying more stress, however, on their habits and physiology\r\nthan upon their anatomy. Lyonnet made a most laborious investigation\r\nof the anatomy of the willow-caterpillar (1762). John Hunter (1728-93)\r\ndissected all kinds of animals, from holothurians to whales. His\r\ninterest was, however, that of the physiologist, and he was not\r\nspecially interested in problems of form. It is interesting to note a\r\nformulation in somewhat confused language of the recapitulation\r\ntheory. The passage occurs in his description of the drawings he made\r\nto illustrate the development of the chick. It is quoted in full by\r\nOwen (J. Hunter, _Observations on certain Parts of the Animal\r\nOEconomy_, with Notes by Richard Owen. London, 1837. Preface, p.\r\nxxvi). We give here the last and clearest sentence--\"If we were to\r\ntake a series of animals from the more imperfect to the perfect, we\r\nshould probably find an imperfect animal corresponding with some stage\r\nof the most perfect.\"\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the time was not towards morphology, but rather to\r\ngeneral natural history and to systematics, the latter under the\r\npowerful influence of Linnaeus (1707-1778). The former tendency is\r\nwell represented by Reaumur (1683-1757) with his observations on\r\ninsects, the digestion of birds, the regeneration of the crayfish's\r\nlegs, and a hundred other matters. To this tendency belong also\r\nTrembley's famous experiments on Hydra (1744), and Roesel von\r\nRosenhof's _Insektenbelustigungen_ (1746-1761).\r\n\r\nBonnet (1720-1793) deserves special mention here, since in his _Traite\r\nd'Insectologie_ (1745), and more fully in his _Contemplation de la\r\nNature_ (1764), he gives the most complete expression to the idea of\r\nthe _Echelle des etres_.\r\n\r\nThis idea seems to have taken complete possession of his imagination.\r\nHe extends it to the universe. Every world has its own scale of\r\nbeings, and all the scales when joined together form but one, which\r\nthen contains all the possible orders of perfection. At the end of the\r\nPreface to his _Traite_ _d'Insectologie_ (OEuvres, i., 1779) he\r\ngives a long table, headed \"Idee d'une Echelle des etres naturels,\"\r\nand rather resembling a ladder, on the rungs of which the following\r\nnames appear:--\r\n\r\nMAN.\r\nOrang-utan.\r\nApe.\r\n\r\nQUADRUPEDS.\r\nFlying squirrel.\r\nBat.\r\nOstrich.\r\n\r\nBIRDS.\r\nAquatic birds.\r\nAmphibious birds.\r\nFlying Fish.\r\n\r\nFISH.\r\nCreeping fish.\r\nEels.\r\nWater serpents.\r\n\r\nSERPENTS.\r\nSlugs.\r\nSnails.\r\n\r\nSHELL FISH.\r\nTube-worms.\r\nClothes-moths.\r\n\r\nINSECTS.\r\nGall insects.\r\nTaenia.\r\nPolyps.\r\nSea Nettles.\r\nSensitive plant.\r\n\r\nPLANTS.\r\nLichens.\r\nMoulds.\r\nFungi, Agarics.\r\nTruffles.\r\nCorals, and Coralloids.\r\nLithophytes.\r\nAsbestos.\r\nTalcs, Gypsums.\r\nSelenites, Slates.\r\n\r\nSTONES.\r\nFigured stones.\r\nCrystals.\r\n\r\nSALTS.\r\nVitriols.\r\n\r\nMETALS.\r\n\r\nHALF-METALS.\r\n\r\nSULPHURS.\r\nBitumens.\r\n\r\nEARTHS.\r\nPure earth.\r\n\r\nWATER.\r\n\r\nAIR.\r\n\r\nFIRE.\r\n\r\nMore subtile matter.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the transitional forms which he inserts between his\r\nprincipal classes show very clearly his entire lack of morphological\r\ninsight--the transitions are functional. The positions assigned to\r\nclothes-moths and corals are very curious! The whole scheme, so\r\nfantastic in its details, was largely influenced by Leibniz's\r\ncontinuity philosophy, and is in no way an improvement on the older\r\nand saner Aristotelian scheme.\r\n\r\nRobinet, in the fifth volume of his book _De la nature_ (1761-6),\r\nforeshadows the somewhat similar views of the German\r\ntranscendentalists. \"All beings,\" he writes, \"have been conceived and\r\nformed on one single plan, of which they are the endlessly graduated\r\nvariations: this prototype is the human form, the metamorphoses of\r\nwhich are to be considered as so many steps towards the most excellent\r\nform of being.\"[23]\r\n\r\nThe idea of a gradation of beings appears also in Buffon (1707-1788),\r\nbut here it takes more definitely its true character as a functional\r\ngradation.[24] \"Since everything in Nature shades into everything\r\nelse,\" he says, \"it is possible to establish a scale for judging of\r\nthe degrees of the intrinsic qualities of every animal.\"[25]\r\n\r\nHe is quite well aware that the groups of Invertebrates are different\r\nin structural plan from the Vertebrates--\"The animal kingdom includes\r\nvarious animated beings, whose organisation is very different from our\r\nown and from that of the animals whose body is similarly constructed\r\nto ours.\"[26]\r\n\r\nHe limits himself to a consideration of the Vertebrates, deeming that\r\nthe economy of an oyster ought not to form part of his subject matter!\r\nHe has a clear perception of the unity of plan which reigns throughout\r\nthe vertebrate series.[27] What is new in Buffon is his interpretation\r\nof the unity of plan. For the first time we find clearly expressed the\r\nthought that unity of plan is to be explained by community of origin.\r\n\r\nBuffon's utterances on this point are, as is well known, somewhat\r\nvacillating. The famous passage, however, which occurs in his account\r\nof the Ass shows pretty clearly that Buffon saw no theoretical\r\nobjection to the descent of all the varied species of animals from one\r\nsingle form. Once admit, he argues, that within the bounds of a single\r\nfamily one species may originate from the type species by\r\n\"degeneration,\" then one might reasonably suppose that from a single\r\nbeing Nature could in time produce all the other organised beings.[28]\r\nElsewhere, _e.g._, in the discourse _De la Degeneration des\r\nAnimaux_,[29] Buffon expresses himself with more caution. He finds that\r\nit is possible to reduce the two hundred species of quadrupeds which\r\nhe has described to quite a small number of families \"from which it is\r\nnot impossible that all the rest are derived.\"[30] Within each of the\r\nfamilies the species branch off from a parent or type species. This we\r\nmay note is a great advance on the linear arrangement implied in the\r\nidea of an _Echelle des etres_.[31]\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to suppose that Buffon was par excellence a maker of\r\nhypotheses. On the contrary he saw things very sanely and with a very\r\nopen mind. He expressly mentions the great difficulties which one\r\nencounters in supposing that one species may arise from another by\r\n\"degeneration.\" How does it happen that two individuals \"degenerate\"\r\njust in the right direction and to the right stage so as to be capable\r\nof breeding together? How is it that one does not find intermediate\r\nlinks between species? One is reminded of the objections, not\r\naltogether without validity, which were made to the Darwinian theory\r\nin its early days. I cannot agree with those who think that Buffon was\r\nan out-and-out evolutionist, who concealed his opinions for fear of\r\nthe Church. No doubt he did trim his sails--the palpably insincere\r\n\"Mais non, il est certain, par la revelation, que tous les animaux ont\r\negalement participe a la grace de la creation,\"[32] following hard upon\r\nthe too bold hypothesis of the origin of all species from a single\r\none, is proof of it. But he was too sane and matter-of-fact a thinker\r\nto go much beyond his facts, and his evolution doctrine remained\r\nalways tentative. One thing, however, he was sure of, that evolution\r\nwould give a rational foundation to the classification which, almost\r\nin spite of himself, he recognised in Nature. If, and only if, the\r\nspecies of one family originated from a single type species, could\r\nfamilies, be founded rationally, _avec raison_.\r\n\r\nBuffon was, curiously enough, rather unwilling to recognise any\r\nsystematic unit higher than the species. Strictly; speaking there are\r\nonly individuals in Nature; but there are also groups of individuals\r\nwhich resemble one another from generation to generation and are able\r\nto breed together. These are species--Buffon adheres to the genetic\r\ndefinition of species--and the species is a much more definite unit\r\nthan the genus, the order, the class, which are not divisions imposed\r\nby us upon Nature. Species are definitely discontinuous,[33] and this\r\nis the only discontinuity which Nature shows us. Buffon put his views\r\ninto practice in his _Histoire Naturelle_, where he describes species\r\nafter species, never uniting them into larger groups. We have seen,\r\nhowever, how the facts forced upon him the conception of the \"family.\"\r\n\r\nBuffon was no morphologist. He left to Daubenton what one might call\r\nthe \"dirty work\" of his book, the dissection and minute description of\r\nthe animals treated.\r\n\r\nBut Buffon was a man of genius, and accordingly his ideas on\r\nmorphology are fresh and illuminating. Few naturalists have been so\r\nfree from the prejudices and traditions of their trade. He makes in\r\nthe _Discours sur la Nature des Animaux_[34] a distinction, which\r\nBichat and Cuvier later developed with much profit, between the\r\n\"animal\" and the \"vegetative\" part of animals.[35] The vegetative or\r\norganic functions go on continuously, even in sleep, and are performed\r\nby the internal organs, of which the heart is the central one. The\r\nactive waking life of the animal, that part of its life which\r\ndistinguishes it from the plant, involves the external parts--the\r\nsense-organs and the extremities. An animal is, as it were, made up of\r\na complex of organs performing the vegetative functions, assimilation,\r\ngrowth, and reproduction, surrounded by an envelope formed by the\r\nlimbs, the sense-organs, the nerves and the brain, which is the centre\r\nof this \"envelope.\"[36] Animals may differ from one another enormously\r\nin the external parts, particularly in the appendicular skeleton,\r\nwithout showing any great difference in the plan and arrangement of\r\ntheir internal organs. Quadrupeds, Cetacea, birds, amphibians and fish\r\nare as unlike as possible in external form and in the shape of their\r\nlimbs; but they all resemble one another in their internal organs. Let\r\nthe internal organs change, however--the external parts will change\r\ninfinitely more, and you will get another animal, an animal of a\r\ntotally different nature. Thus an insect has a most singular internal\r\neconomy, and, in consequence, you find it is in every point different\r\nfrom any vertebrate animal.\r\n\r\nIn this contrast, on the whole justified, between the importance of\r\nvariations in the \"vegetative\" and variations in the \"animal\" parts,\r\none may see without doing violence to Buffon's thought, an indication\r\nof the difference between homology and analogy. It is usually in the\r\nexternal parts, in the organs by which the animal adapts itself to its\r\nenvironment, that one meets with the greatest number of analogical\r\nresemblances. This contrast of vegetative and animal parts and their\r\nrelative importance for the discovery of affinities was at any rate a\r\nconsiderable step towards an analysis of the concept of unity of plan.\r\n\r\nTo Xavier Bichat (1771-1802) belongs the credit of working out in\r\ndetail the distinction drawn by Aristotle and Buffon between the\r\nanimal and the vegetative functions. Bichat was not a comparative\r\nanatomist; his interest lay in human anatomy, normal and pathological.\r\nSo his views are drawn chiefly from the consideration of human\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nHe classifies functions into those relating to the individual and\r\nthose relating to the species. The functions pertaining to the\r\nindividual may be divided into those of the animal and those of the\r\norganic life.[37] \"I call _animal life_ that order of functions which\r\nconnects us with surrounding bodies; signifying thereby that this\r\norder belongs only to animals\" (p. lxxviii.). Its organs are the\r\nafferent and efferent nerves, the brain, the sense-organs and the\r\nvoluntary muscles; the brain is its central organ. \"Digestion,\r\ncirculation, respiration, exhalation, absorption, secretion,\r\nnutrition, calorification, or production of animal heat, compose\r\norganic life, whose principal and central organ is the heart\" (p.\r\nlxxix.).\r\n\r\nThe contrast of the animal and the organic life runs through all\r\nBichat's work; it receives classical expression in his _Recherches\r\nPhysiologiques sur la Vie et la Mort_ (1800). The plant and the animal\r\nstand for two different modes of living. The plant lives within\r\nitself, and has with the external world only relations of nutrition;\r\nthe animal adds to this organic life a life of active relation with\r\nsurrounding things (3rd ed., 1805, p. 2). \"One might almost say that\r\nthe plant is the framework, the foundation of the animal, and that to\r\nform the animal it sufficed to cover this foundation with a system of\r\norgans fitted to establish relations with the world outside. It\r\nfollows that the functions of the animal form two quite distinct\r\nclasses. One class consists in a continual succession of assimilation\r\nand excretion; through these functions the animal incessantly\r\ntransforms into its own substance the molecules of surrounding bodies,\r\nlater to reject these molecules when they have become heterogeneous to\r\nit. Through this first class of functions the animal exists only\r\nwithin itself; through the other class it exists outside; it is an\r\ninhabitant of the world, and not, like the plant, of the place which\r\nsaw its birth. The animal feels and perceives its surroundings,\r\nreflects its sensations, moves of its own will under their influence,\r\nand, as a rule, can communicate by its voice its desires and its\r\nfears, its pleasures or its pains. I call organic life the sum of the\r\nfunctions of the former class, for all organised creatures, plants or\r\nanimals, possess them to a more or less marked degree, and organised\r\nstructure is the sole condition necessary to their exercise. The\r\ncombined functions of the second class form the 'animal' life, so\r\nnamed because it is the exclusive attribute of the animal kingdom\"\r\n(pp. 2-3).\r\n\r\nIn both lives there is a double movement, in the animal life from the\r\nperiphery to the centre and from the centre to the periphery, in the\r\norganic life also from the exterior to the interior and back again,\r\nbut here a movement of composition and decomposition. As the brain\r\nmediates between sensation and motion, so the vascular system is the\r\ngo-between of the organs of assimilation and the organs of\r\ndissimilation.\r\n\r\nThe most essential structural difference between the organs of animal\r\nlife and the organs of organic life is in man and the higher animals\r\nat least, the symmetry of the one set and the irregularity of the\r\nother--compare the symmetry of the nerves and muscles of the animal\r\nlife with the asymmetrical disposition of the visceral muscles and the\r\nsympathetic nerves, which belong to the organic life.\r\n\r\nNoteworthy differences exist between the two lives with respect to the\r\ninfluence of habit. Everything in the animal life is under the\r\ndominion of habit. Habit dulls sensation, habit strengthens the\r\njudgment. In the organic life, on the contrary, habit exercises no\r\ninfluence. The difference comes out clearly in the development of the\r\nindividual. The organs of the organic life attain their full\r\nperfection independently of use; the organs of the animal life require\r\nan education, and without education they do not reach perfection\r\n(_Loc. cit._, p. 127).\r\n\r\nBichat was the founder of what was known for a time as General\r\nAnatomy--the study of the constituent tissues of the body in health\r\nand disease. His classification of tissues was macroscopical and\r\nphysiological; he relied upon texture and function in distinguishing\r\nthem rather than upon microscopical structure. The tissues he\r\ndistinguished are as follows:--[38]\r\n\r\n1. The cellular membrane.\r\n2. Nerves of animal life.\r\n3. Nerves of organic life.\r\n4. Arteries.\r\n5. Veins.\r\n6. Exhalants.\r\n7. Absorbents and glands.\r\n8. Bones.\r\n9. Medulla.\r\n10. Cartilage.\r\n11. Fibrous tissue.\r\n12. Fibro-cartilage.\r\n13. Muscles of organic life.\r\n14. Muscles of animal life.\r\n15. Mucous membrane.\r\n16. Serous membrane.\r\n17. Synovial membrane.\r\n18. The Glands.\r\n19. The Dermis.\r\n20. Epidermis.\r\n21. Cutis.\r\n\r\nThe \"cellular membrane\" seems to mean undifferentiated connective\r\ntissue; \"exhalants\" are imperceptible tubes arising from the\r\ncapillaries and secreting fat, serum, marrow, etc.; the \"absorbents\r\nand glands\" are the lymphatics and the lymphatic glands.\r\n\r\nIn Bichat's eyes this resolution of the organism into tissues had a\r\ndeeper significance than any separation into organs, for to each\r\ntissue must be attributed a _vie propre_, an individual and peculiar\r\nlife. \"When we study a function we must consider the complicated organ\r\nwhich performs it in a general way; but if we would be instructed in\r\nthe properties and life of that organ we must absolutely resolve it\r\ninto its constituent parts.\"[39] The tissues have, too, a great\r\nimportance for pathology, for diseases are often diseases of tissues\r\nrather than of organs.[40]\r\n\r\n    [9] _Le Monde vegetal_, p. 41, Paris, 1907.\r\n\r\n    [10] _Exercitationes de generatione animalium_,1651.

There are also\r\nsecondary functions. Of these the most important, in animals at least,\r\nare the faculties of feeling and moving. These two faculties are\r\nnecessarily bound up together; if Nature has given animals sensation\r\nshe must also have given them the power of movement, the power to flee\r\nfrom what is harmful and draw near to what is good. These two\r\nfaculties determine all the others. A creature that feels and moves\r\nrequires a stomach to carry food in. Food requires instruments to\r\ndivide it, liquids to digest it. Plants, which do not feel and do not\r\nmove, have no need of a stomach, but have roots instead. Thus the\r\n\"Animal Functions\" of feeling and moving determine the character of\r\nthe organs of the second order, the organs of digestion. These in\r\ntheir turn are prior to the organs of circulation, which are a means\r\nto the end of distributing the nutrient fluid or blood to all parts of\r\nthe body. These organs of the third order are not only dependent on\r\nthose of the second order, but are also not even necessary, for many\r\nanimals are without them. Only animals with a circulatory system can\r\nhave definite breathing organs--lungs or gills. Plants, and animals\r\nwithout a circulation, breathe by their whole surface.\r\n\r\nThere is accordingly a rational order of functions, and therefore of\r\nthe systems of organs which perform them. The most important are the\r\nAnimal Functions, with their great organ-system, the neuro-muscular\r\nmechanism. Then come the digestive functions, and after them, and in a\r\nsense accessory to them, the functions and organs of circulation and\r\nrespiration. The last three may be grouped as the Vital Functions.\r\n\r\nThe Animal Functions not only determine the character of the Vital\r\nFunctions, but influence also the primary faculty of generation, for\r\nanimals' power of movement has rendered their mode of fecundation more\r\nsimple, has therefore had an effect on their organs of generation.\r\n\r\nThis division into \"Animal\" and \"Vital\" functions recalls Buffon's and\r\nBichat's distinction of the \"animal\" and the \"vegetative\" lives.\r\nCuvier apparently took this idea from Buffon, for he says that a plant\r\nis an animal that sleeps.[42] But the idea is as old as Aristotle, who\r\ndiscusses the \"sleep\" of embryos and of plants in the last book of the\r\n_De Generatione animalium_. The distinction between animal and\r\nvegetative life is, of course, based for Aristotle in the difference\r\nbetween the [Greek: psyche aisthetike] and the [Greek: psyche\r\nthreptike]. Cuvier, like Aristotle, Buffon, and Bichat, makes the\r\nheart the centre of the \"vegetative\" organs.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that Cuvier puts function before structure,\r\nand infers from function what the organ will be. \"Plants,\" he writes,\r\n\"having few faculties, have a very simple organisation.\"[43] It is only\r\nafter having discussed and classified functions that Cuvier goes on to\r\nexamine organs.\r\n\r\nFirst his views on the composition of the animal body. Aristotle\r\ndistinguished three degrees of composition--the \"elements,\" the\r\nhomogeneous parts, and the heterogeneous parts or organs. Cuvier does\r\nthe same. Some small advance has been made in the two thousand years'\r\ninterval, due in the first place to the progress of chemistry, and in\r\nthe second to the invention of the microscope. To the first\r\ncircumstance Cuvier owes his knowledge that the inorganic substances\r\nforming the first degree of composition are principally C, N, H, O,\r\nand P, combined to form albumen, fibrine, and the like, which are in\r\ntheir turn combined to form the solids and fluids of the body. To the\r\nlatter circumstance Cuvier owes the statement that the finest\r\nfragments into which mechanical division can resolve the organism are\r\nlittle flakes and filaments, which, joined up loosely together, form a\r\n\"cellulosity.\" The discovery of the true cellular nature of animal\r\ntissues did not come till much later, till some years after Cuvier's\r\ndeath in 1832. Knowledge of histological detail was, however,\r\nconsiderable by the beginning of the 19th century. Cuvier knew, for\r\nexample, that each muscle fibre has its own nerve fibre. But he gives\r\nno elaborate account of the homogeneous parts, no detailed histology.\r\nOn the other hand his treatment of the heterogeneous parts or organs\r\nis detailed and masterly.[44]\r\n\r\nThe main systems of organs are, in order of importance, the nervous\r\nand muscular, the digestive, the circulatory, and the respiratory.\r\nEach organ or system of organs may have many forms. If any form of any\r\norgan could exist in combination with any form of all the others there\r\nwould be an enormous number of combinations theoretically possible.\r\nBut these combinations do not all exist in Nature, for organs are not\r\nmerely assembled (_rapproche's_), but act upon one another, and act\r\nall together for a common end. Accordingly only the combinations that\r\nfulfil these conditions exist in Nature. Cuvier thus dismisses the\r\nquestion of a science of possible organic forms and considers only the\r\nforms or combinations actually existing. This question of the\r\npossibility of a \"theoretical\" morphology of living things, after the\r\nfashion of the morphology of crystals with their sixteen possible\r\ntypes, was raised in later years by K. G. Carus, Bronn, and Haeckel.\r\n\r\nOrganisms, then, are harmonious combinations of organs, and the\r\nharmony is primarily a harmony of functions. Every function depends\r\nupon every other, and all are necessary. The harmony of organs and\r\ntheir mutual dependence are the results of the interdependence of\r\nfunction. This thought, the recognition of the functional unity of the\r\norganism, is the fundamental one at the base of all Cuvier's work.\r\nBefore him men had recognised more or less clearly the harmony of\r\nstructure and function, and had based much of their work upon this\r\nunanalysed assumption. Cuvier was the first naturalist to raise this\r\nthought to the level of a principle peculiar to natural history. \"It\r\nis on this mutual dependence of the functions and the assistance which\r\nthey lend one to another that are founded the laws that determine the\r\nrelations of their organs; these laws are as inevitable as the laws of\r\nmetaphysics and mathematics, for it is evident that a proper harmony\r\nbetween organs that act one upon another is a necessary condition of\r\nthe existence of the being to which they belong.\"[45]\r\n\r\nThis rational principle, peculiar to natural history, Cuvier calls the\r\nprinciple of the conditions of existence, for the following\r\nreason:--\"Since nothing can exist that does not fulfil the conditions\r\nwhich render its existence possible, the different parts of each being\r\nmust be co-ordinated in such a way as to render possible the existence\r\nof the being as a whole, not only in itself, but also in its relations\r\nwith other beings, and the analysis of these conditions often leads to\r\ngeneral laws which are as certain as those which are derived from\r\ncalculation or from experiment.\"[46]\r\n\r\nBy \"conditions of existence\" he means something quite different from\r\nwhat is now commonly understood. The idea of the external conditions\r\nof existence, the environment, enters very little into his thought. He\r\nis intent on the adaptations of function and organ within the living\r\ncreature--a point of view rather neglected nowadays, but essential for\r\nthe understanding of living things. The very condition of existence of\r\na living thing, and part of the essential definition of it, is that\r\nits parts work together for the good of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the adaptedness of parts may be used as an\r\nexplanatory principle, enabling the naturalist to trace out in detail\r\nthe interdependence of functions and their organs. When you have\r\ndiscovered how one organ is adapted to another and to the whole, you\r\nhave gone a certain way towards understanding it. That is using\r\nteleology as a regulative principle, in Kant's sense of the word.\r\nCuvier was indeed a teleologist after the fashion of Kant, and there\r\ncan be no doubt that he was influenced, at least in the exposition of\r\nhis ideas, by Kant's _Kritik der Urtheilskraft_, which appeared ten\r\nyears before the publication of the _Lecons d'Anatomie Comparee_.\r\nTeleology in Kant's sense is and will always be a necessary postulate\r\nof biology. It does not supply an explanation of organic forms and\r\nactivities, but without it one cannot even begin to understand living\r\nthings. Adaptedness is the most general fact of life, and innumerable\r\nlesser facts can be grouped as particular cases of it, can be, so far,\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nCuvier's famous principle of correlation, the corner-stone of his\r\nwork, is simply the practical application to the facts of structure of\r\nthe principle of functional adaptedness. By the principle of\r\ncorrelation, from one part of an animal, given sufficient knowledge of\r\nthe structure of its like, you can in a general way construct the\r\nwhole. \"This must necessarily be so: for all the organs of an animal\r\nform a single system, the parts of which hang together, and act and\r\nre-act upon one another; and no modifications can appear in one part\r\nwithout bringing about corresponding modifications in all the\r\nrest.\"[47] The logical basis of the principle is sound. The functions\r\nof the parts are all intimately bound up with one another, and one\r\nfunction cannot vary without bringing in its train corresponding\r\nmodifications in the others. Structure and function are bound up\r\ntogether; every modification of a function entails therefore the\r\nmodification of an organ. Hence from the shape of one organ you can\r\ninfer the shape of the other organs--if you have sufficiently\r\nextensive empirical knowledge of functions, and of the relation of\r\nstructure to function in each kind of organ. Given an alimentary canal\r\ncapable of digesting only flesh, and possessing therefore a certain\r\nform, you know that the other functions must be adapted to this\r\nparticular function of the alimentary canal. The animal must have keen\r\nsight, fine smell, speed, agility, and strength in paws and jaws.\r\nThese particular functions must have correspondingly modified organs,\r\nwell-developed eyes and ears, claws and teeth. Further, you know from\r\nexperience that such and such definitely modified organs are\r\ninvariably found with the carnivorous habit, carnassial teeth, for\r\nexample, and reduced clavicles. From a \"carnivorous\" alimentary canal,\r\nthen, you can infer with certainty that the animal possessed\r\ncarnassial teeth and the other structural peculiarities of carnivorous\r\nanimals, _e.g._, the peculiar coronoid process of the mandible. From\r\nthe carnassial tooth you can infer the reduced clavicle, and so on.\r\n\"In a word, the form of the tooth implies the form of the condyle;\r\nthat of the shoulder blade that of the claws, just as the equation of\r\na curve implies all its properties.\"[48]\r\n\r\nSimilarly the great respiratory power of birds is correlated with\r\ntheir great muscular strength, and renders necessary great digestive\r\npowers. Hence the correlated structure of lungs, muscles and their\r\nattachments, and alimentary canal, in birds.\r\n\r\nNot only do systems of organs, by being adjusted to special\r\nmodifications of function, influence one another, but so also do parts\r\nof the same organ. This is noticeably the case with the skeleton,\r\nwhere hardly a facet can vary without the others varying\r\nproportionately, so that from one bone you can up to a certain point\r\ndeduce all the rest.\r\n\r\nWe deduce the necessity, the constancy, of these co-existences of\r\norgans from the observed reciprocal influence of their functions. That\r\nbeing established, we can argue from observed constancy of relation\r\nbetween two organs an action of one upon the other, and so be led to a\r\ndiscovery of their functions. But even if we do not discover the\r\nfunctional interdependencies of the parts, we can use the established\r\nfact of the constant co-existence of two parts as proof of a\r\nfunctional correlation between them.\r\n\r\nCorrelation is either a rational or an empirical principle, according\r\nas we know or do not know the interdependence of function of which it\r\nis the expression. Even when we apply the rational principle of\r\ncorrelation it would be useless in our hands if we had not extensive\r\nempirical knowledge; when we use an empirical rule of correlation we\r\ndepend entirely upon observation. \"There are a great many cases,\"\r\nwrites Cuvier,[49] \"where our theoretical knowledge of the relations of\r\nforms would not suffice, if it were not filled out by observation,\"\r\nthat is to say, there are many cases of correlation not yet explicable\r\nin terms of function. From a hoof you can deduce the main characters\r\nof herbivores (with a certain amount of assistance from your empirical\r\nknowledge of herbivores), but could you from a cloven hoof deduce that\r\nthe animal is a ruminant, unless you had observed the constancy of\r\nrelation, not directly explicable in terms of function, between cloven\r\nhoofs and chewing the cud? Or could you deduce from the existence of\r\nfrontal horns that the animal ruminates? \"Nevertheless, since these\r\nrelations are constant, they must necessarily have a sufficient cause;\r\nbut as we are ignorant of this cause, observation must supplement\r\ntheory; observation establishes empirical laws which become almost as\r\ncertain as the rational laws, when they are based upon a sufficient\r\nnumber of observations.... But that there exist all the same hidden\r\nreasons for all these relations is partly revealed by observation\r\nitself, independently of general philosophy.\"[50] That is to say, even\r\ncorrelations for which no explanation in terms of function can be\r\nsupplied are probably in reality functional correlations. This may, in\r\nsome cases, be inferred from the graded correspondence of two sets of\r\norgans. For example, ungulates which do not ruminate, and have not a\r\ncloven hoof, have a more perfect dentition and more bones in the foot\r\nthan the true cloven-hoofed ruminants. There is a correlation between\r\nthe state of development of the teeth and of the foot. This\r\ncorrelation is a graded one, for camels, which have a more perfect\r\ndentition than other ruminants, have also a bone more in their tarsus.\r\nIt seems probable, therefore, that there is some reason, that is, some\r\nexplanation in terms of function, for this case of correlation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the fact remains that many correlations are not\r\nexplicable in terms of function, and the substitution of correlation\r\nas an empirical principle for correlation as a rational principle\r\nmarks for Cuvier a step away from his functional comparative anatomy\r\ntowards a pure morphology. It is significant that in later times the\r\nterm correlation has come to be applied more especially to the purely\r\nempirical constancies of relation, and has lost most of its functional\r\nsignificance. But the correlation of the parts of an organism is no\r\nmere mathematical concept, to be expressed by a coefficient, but\r\nsomething deeper and more vital.\r\n\r\nCuvier interpreted the functional dependence of the parts in terms of\r\nwhat we now call the general metabolism. He had a clear vision of the\r\nconstant movement of molecules in the living tissue, combining and\r\nrecombining, of the organism taking in and intercalating molecules\r\nfrom outside from the food and rejecting molecules in the excretions,\r\na ceaseless _tourbillon vital_. \"This general movement, universal in\r\nevery part, is so unmistakably the very essence of life that parts\r\nseparated from a living body straightway die.\"[51] The organisation of\r\nthe body, the arrangement of its solids and liquids, is adapted to\r\nfurther the _tourbillon vital_. \"Each part contributes to this general\r\nmovement its own particular action and is affected by it in particular\r\nways, with the result that, in every being, life is a unity which\r\nresults from the mutual action and reaction of all its parts.\"[52]\r\n\r\nCuvier, however, did not resolve life into metabolism, nor reduce\r\nvital happenings to the chemical level. The form of organised bodies\r\nis more essential than the matter of which they are composed, for the\r\nmatter changes ceaselessly while the form remains unchanged. It is in\r\nform that we must seek the differences between species, and not in the\r\ncombinations of matter, which are almost the same in all.[53] The\r\ndifferences are to be sought at the level of the second and third\r\ndegrees of composition.\r\n\r\nThe existence of differences of form introduces a new problem, the\r\nproblem of diversity. There are only a few possible combinations of\r\nthe principal organs, but as you get down to less important parts the\r\npossible scope of variation is greatly increased, and most of the\r\npossible variations do exist. Nature seems prodigal of form, of form\r\nwhich needs not to be useful in order to exist. \"It needs only to be\r\npossible, _i.e._, of such a character that it does not, destroy the\r\nharmony of the whole.\"[54] We seize here the relation of the principle\r\nof the adaptedness of parts to the problem of the variety of form. The\r\nformer is in a sense a regulative and conservative principle which\r\nlays down limits beyond which variation may not stray. In itself it is\r\nnot a fountain of change; there must be another cause of change. This\r\nthought is of great importance for theories of descent.\r\n\r\nCuvier has no theory to account for the variety of form: he contents\r\nhimself with a classification. There are two main ways of classifying\r\nforms; you may classify according to single organs or according to the\r\ntotality of organs. By the first method you can have as many\r\nclassifications as you have organs, and the classifications will not\r\nnecessarily coincide. Thus you can divide animals according to their\r\norgans of digestion into two classes, those in which the alimentary\r\ncanal is a sac with one opening (zoophytes) and those in which the\r\ncanal has two openings,[55] a curious forestalment, in the rough, of\r\nthe modern division of Metazoa into Coelentera and Coelomata.\r\n\r\nIt is only by taking single organs that you can arrange animals into\r\nlong series, and you will have as many series as you take organs. Only\r\nin this way can you form any _Echelle des etres_ or graded series; and\r\nyou can get even this kind of gradation only within each of the big\r\ngroups formed on a common plan of structure; you can never grade, for\r\nexample, from Invertebrates to Vertebrates through intermediate\r\nforms[56] (which is perfectly true, in spite of Amphioxus and\r\nBalanoglossus!).\r\n\r\nIn the _Regne Animal_ Cuvier restricts the application of the idea of\r\nthe _Echelle_ within even narrower limits, refusing to admit its\r\nvalidity within the bounds of the vertebrate phylum, or even within\r\nthe vertebrate classes. This seems, however, to refer to a seriation\r\nof whole organisms and not of organs, so that the possibility of a\r\nseriation of organs within a class is not denied. Cuvier was, above\r\nall, a positive spirit, and he looked askance at all speculation which\r\nwent beyond the facts. \"The pretended scale of beings,\" he wrote, \"is\r\nonly an erroneous application to the totality of creation of partial\r\nobservations, which have validity only when confined to the sphere\r\nwithin which they were made.\"[57] This remark, which is after all only\r\njust, perfectly expresses Cuvier's attitude to the transcendental\r\ntheories, and was probably a protest against the sweeping\r\ngeneralisations of his colleague, Etienne Geoffroy St Hilaire.\r\n\r\nA true classification should be based upon the comparison of all\r\norgans, but all organs are not of equal value for classification, nor\r\nare all the variations of each organ equally important. In estimating\r\nthe value of variations more stress should be laid on function than on\r\nform, for only those variations are important which affect the mode of\r\nfunctioning. These are the principles on which Cuvier bases the\r\nclassification of animals given in the _Lecons_, Article V., \"Division\r\ndes animaux d'apres l'ensemble de leur organisation.\" The scheme of\r\nclassification actually given in the _Lecons_ recalls curiously that\r\nof Aristotle, for there is the same broad division into Vertebrates,\r\nwith red blood, and Invertebrates, almost all with white blood. Nine\r\nclasses altogether are distinguished--Mammals, Birds, Reptiles,\r\nFishes, Molluscs, Crustacea, Insects, Worms, Zoophytes (including\r\nEchinoderms and Coelenterates).\r\n\r\nA maturer theory and practice of classification is given in the _Regne\r\nAnimal_ of seventeen years later. Here the principle of the\r\nsubordination of characters (which seems to have been first explicitly\r\nstated by the younger de Jussieu in his _Genera Plantarum_, 1789,[58])\r\nis more clearly recognised. The properties or peculiarities of\r\nstructure which have the greatest number of relations of\r\nincompatibility and coexistence, and therefore influence the whole in\r\nthe greatest degree, are the important or dominating characters, to\r\nwhich the others must be subordinated in classification. These\r\ndominant characters are also the most constant.[59] In deciding which\r\ncharacters are the most important Cuvier makes use of his fundamental\r\nclassification of functions and organs into two main sets. \"The heart\r\nand the organs of circulation are a kind of centre for the vegetative\r\nfunctions, as the brain and the spinal cord are for the animal\r\nfunctions.\"[60] These two organ-systems vary in harmony, and their\r\ncharacters must form the basis for the delimitation of the great\r\ngroups. Judged by this standard there are four principal types of\r\nform,[61] of which all the others are but modifications. These four\r\ntypes are Vertebrates, Molluscs, Articulates, and Radiates. The first\r\nthree have bilateral, the last has radial symmetry. Vertebrates and\r\nMolluscs have blood-vessels, but Articulates show a functional\r\ntransition from the blood-vessel to the tracheal system. Radiates\r\napproach the homogeneity of plants; they appear to lack a distinct\r\nnervous system and sense organs, and the lowest of them show only a\r\nhomogeneous pulp which is mobile and sensitive. All four classes are\r\nprincipally distinguished from one another by the broad structural\r\nrelations of their neuromuscular system, of the organs of the animal\r\nfunctions. Vertebrates have a spinal cord and brain, an internal\r\nskeleton built on a definite plan, with an axis and appendages; in\r\nMolluscs the muscles are attached to the skin and the shell, and the\r\nnervous system consists of separate masses; Articulates have a hard\r\nexternal skeleton and jointed limbs, and their nervous system consists\r\nof two long ventral cords; Radiates have ill-defined nervous and\r\nmuscular systems, and in their lowest forms possess the animal\r\nfunctions without the animal organs.\r\n\r\nThis well-rounded classification of animal forms is in a sense the\r\ncrown of Cuvier's work, for the principle of the subordination of\r\ncharacters, in the interpretation which he gives to it, is a direct\r\napplication of his principle of functional correlation. Each of the\r\ngreat groups is built upon one plan. The idea of the unity of plan has\r\nbecome for Cuvier a commonplace of his thought, and it is tacitly\r\nrecognised in all his anatomical work. But he never takes it as a\r\nhard-and-fast principle which must at all costs be imposed upon the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nCuvier has become known as the greatest champion of the fixity of\r\nspecies, but it is not often recognised that his attitude to this\r\nproblem is at least as scientific as that of the evolutionists of his\r\nown and later times. No doubt he became dogmatic in his rejection of\r\nevolution-theory, but he was on sure ground in maintaining that the\r\nevolutionists of his day went beyond their facts. He considered that\r\ncertain forms (species) have reproduced themselves from the origin of\r\nthings without exceeding the limits of variation. His definition of a\r\nspecies was, \"the individuals descended from one another or from\r\ncommon parents, together with those that resemble them as much as they\r\nresemble one another.\"[62] \"These forms are neither produced nor do\r\nthey change of themselves; life presupposes their existence, for it\r\ncannot arise save in organisations ready prepared for it.\"[63]\r\n\r\nHe based his rejection of all theories of descent upon the absence of\r\ndefinite evidence for evolution. If species have gradually changed, he\r\nargued, one ought to find traces of these gradual modifications.[64]\r\nPalaeontology does not furnish such traces. Again, the limits of\r\nvariation, even under domestication, are narrow, and the most extreme\r\nvariation does not fundamentally alter the specific type. Thus the dog\r\nhas varied perhaps most of all, in size, in shape, in colour. \"But\r\nthroughout all these variations the relations of the bones remain the\r\nsame, and the form of the teeth never changes to an appreciable\r\nextent; at most there are some individuals in which an additional\r\nfalse molar develops on one side or the other.\"[65] This second\r\nobjection is the objection of the morphologist. It would be an\r\ninteresting study to compare Cuvier's views on variation with those of\r\nDarwin, who was essentially a systematist.\r\n\r\nCuvier's first objection was of course determined to some extent by\r\nthe imperfection of the palaeontological knowledge of his time. But\r\neven at the present day the objection has a certain force, for\r\nalthough we have definite evidence of many serial transformations of\r\none species into another along a single line, for example, Neumayr's\r\n_Paludina_ series, yet at any one geological level the species, the\r\nlines of descent, are all distinct from one another.[66]\r\n\r\nCuvier recognised very clearly that there is a succession of forms in\r\ntime, and that on the whole the most primitive forms are the earliest\r\nto appear. Mammals are later than reptiles, and fishes appear earlier\r\nthan either. As Deperet puts it, \"Cuvier not only demonstrated the\r\npresence in the sedimentary strata of a series of terrestrial faunas\r\nsuperimposed and distinct, but he was the first to express, and that\r\nvery clearly, the idea of the gradual increase in complexity of these\r\nfaunas from the oldest to the most recent\" (p. 10).\r\n\r\nHe did not believe that the fauna of one epoch was transformed into\r\nthe fauna of the next. He explained the disappearance of the one by\r\nthe hypothesis of sudden catastrophes, and the appearance of the next\r\nby the hypothesis of immigration. He nowhere advanced the hypothesis\r\nof successive new creations. \"For the rest, when I maintain that the\r\nstony layers contain the bones of several genera and the earthy layers\r\nthose of several species which no longer exist, I do not mean that a\r\nnew creation has been necessary to produce the existing species, I\r\nmerely say that they did not exist in the same localities and must\r\nhave come thither from elsewhere.\"[67] It was left to d'Orbigny to\r\nteach the doctrine of successive creations, of which he distinguished\r\ntwenty-seven (_Cours elementaire de palaeontologie stratigraphique_,\r\n1849).\r\n\r\nCuvier, however, can hardly have believed that all species were\r\npresent at the beginning, since he does admit a progression of forms.\r\nProbably he had no theory on the subject, for theories without facts\r\nhad little interest for him. At any rate it is a mistake to think that\r\nCuvier was a supporter of the theological doctrine of special\r\ncreation. His philosophy of Nature was mechanistic, and he dedicated\r\nhis _Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles_ to his friend Laplace. He\r\nadmitted the idea of evolution at least so far as to conceive of a\r\ndevelopment of man from a savage to a civilised state.[68] He refused\r\nto accept the extravagant evolutionary theory of Demaillet and the\r\nsomewhat confused theory of Lamarck (whom he joins with Demaillet),[69]\r\njust as he rejected the transcendental theories of Geoffroy St\r\nHilaire, because they seemed to him not based upon facts.\r\n\r\n    [41] _Lecons d'Anatomie Comparee_, tome i., pp. 10 _et\r\n    scq._, 1800.\r\n\r\n    [42] _Lecons d'Anatomie Comparee_, i., p. 18.\r\n\r\n    [43] _Loc. cit._, i., p. 13.\r\n\r\n    [44] _Lecons d'Anatomie Comparee_, tome i., Articles\r\n    iii.-iv., 1800.\r\n\r\n    [45] _Lecons d'Anatomie Comparee_, i., p. 47.\r\n\r\n    [46] _Le Regne Animal_, i., p. 6, 1817.\r\n\r\n    [47] _Histoire des Progres des Sciences naturelles depuis\r\n    1789_, i., p. 310, 1826.\r\n\r\n    [48] _Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles_, i., p. 60,\r\n    1812.\r\n\r\n    [49] _Ossemens fossiles_, i., p. 60.\r\n\r\n    [50] _Loc. cit._, i., p. 63.\r\n\r\n    [51] _Lecons d'Anatomie Comparee_, i., p. 6.\r\n\r\n    [52] _Le Regne Animal_, i., p. 16.\r\n\r\n    [53] _Hist.

Scientific theories are\r\nnot so much formulae extracted from experience as intuitions imposed\r\nupon experience. So it was that Goethe, who was little more than a\r\ndilettante,[70] seized upon the essential principles of a morphology\r\nsome years before that morphology was accepted by the workers.\r\n\r\nGoethe is important in the history of morphological method because he\r\nwas the first to bring to clear consciousness and to express in\r\ndefinite terms the idea on which comparative anatomy before him was\r\nbased, the idea of the unity of plan. We have seen that this idea was\r\nfamiliar to Aristotle and that it was recognised implicitly by all who\r\nafter him studied structure comparatively. In Goethe's time the idea\r\nhad become ripe for expression. It was used as a guiding principle in\r\nGoethe's youth particularly by Vicq d'Azyr and by Camper. The former\r\n(1748-1794), who discovered[71] in the same year as Goethe (1784) the\r\nintermaxillary bone in man, pointed out the homology in structure\r\nbetween the fore limb and the hind limb, and interpreted certain\r\nrudimentary bones, the intermaxillaries and rudimentary clavicles, in\r\nthe light of the theory that Vertebrates are built upon one single\r\nplan of structure.\r\n\r\n\"Nature seems to operate always according to an original and general\r\nplan, from which she departs with regret and whose traces we come\r\nacross everywhere\" (Vicq d'Azyr, quoted by Flourens, _Mem. Acad.\r\nSei._, XXIII., p. xxxvi.).\r\n\r\nPeter Camper (1722-1789), we are told by Goethe himself in his\r\n_Osteologie_, was convinced of the unity of plan holding throughout\r\nVertebrates; he compared in particular the brain of fishes with the\r\nbrain of man.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the unity of plan had not yet become limited and defined\r\nas a strictly scientific theory; it was an idea common to philosophy,\r\nto ordinary thought, and to anatomical science. We find it expressed\r\nby Herder (who perhaps got it from Kant) in his _Ideen sur Philosophie\r\nder Geschichte der Menschheit_ (1784), and it is possible that Goethe\r\nbecame impressed with the importance of the idea through his\r\nconversations with Herder. Be that as it may, it is certain that\r\nGoethe sought for the intermaxillaries in man only because he was\r\nfirmly convinced that the skeleton in all the higher animals was built\r\nupon one common plan and that accordingly bones such as the\r\nintermaxillaries, found well developed in some animals, must also be\r\nfound in man. The idea was not drawn from the facts, but the facts\r\nwere interpreted and even sought for in the light of the idea. \"I\r\neagerly worked upon a general osteological scheme, and had accordingly\r\nto assume that all the separate parts of the structure, in detail as\r\nin the whole, must be discoverable in all animals, because on this\r\nsupposition is built the already long begun science of comparative\r\nanatomy.\"[72]\r\n\r\nThe principle comes to clear expression in his _Erster Entwurf einer\r\nallgemeinen Einleitung in die vergleichende Anatomie_ (1795).[73] He\r\nwrites:--\"On this account an attempt is here made to arrive at an\r\nanatomical type, a general picture in which the forms of all animals\r\nare contained in potentia, and by means of which we can describe each\r\nanimal in an invariable order.\"[74] His aim is to discover a general\r\nscheme of the constant in organic parts, a scheme into which all\r\nanimals will fit equally well, and no animal better than the rest.\r\nWhen we remember that the type to which anatomists before him had,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, referred all other structure was man\r\nhimself, we see that in seeking after an abstract generalised type\r\nGoethe was reaching out to a new conception. The fact that only the\r\nstructure of man and the higher animals was at all well-known in his\r\ntime led Goethe to think that his general Typus would hold for the\r\nlower animals as well, though it was to be arrived at primarily from a\r\nstudy of the higher animals. All he could assert of the entire animal\r\nkingdom was that all animals agreed in having a head, a middle part,\r\nand an end part, with their characteristic organs, and that\r\naccordingly they might, in this respect at least, be reduced to one\r\ncommon Typus. Goethe's knowledge of the lower animals was not\r\nextensive.\r\n\r\nThough Goethe did not work out a criterion of the homology of parts\r\nwith any great clearness, he had an inkling of the principle later\r\ndeveloped by E. Geoffroy St Hilaire, and called by him the \"Principle\r\nof Connections.\" According to this principle, the homology of a part\r\nis determined by its position relative to other parts. Goethe\r\nexpresses it thus:--\"On the other hand the most constant factor is the\r\nposition in which the bone is invariably found, and the function to\r\nwhich it is adapted in the organic edifice.\"[75] But from this sentence\r\nit is not clear that Goethe understood the principle as one of form\r\nindependent of function, for he seems to consider that the homology of\r\nan organ is partly determined by the function which it performs for\r\nthe whole. He wavers between the purely formal or morphological\r\ninterpretation of the principle of connections and the functional. We\r\nfind him in the additions to the _Entwurf_ (1796), saying:--\"We must\r\ntake into consideration not merely the spatial relations of the parts,\r\nbut also their living reciprocal influence, their dependence upon and\r\naction on one another.\" [76] But in seeking for the intermaxillary bone\r\nin man he was guided by its position relative to the maxillaries--it\r\nmust be the bone between the anterior ends of the maxillaries, a bone\r\nwhose limits are indicated in the adult only by surface grooves.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact Goethe's morphological views are neither very\r\nclearly expressed nor very consistent. This comes out in his treatment\r\nof the relation between structure and function. Sometimes he takes the\r\nview that structure determines function. \"The parts of the animal,\" he\r\nwrites, \"their reciprocal forms, their relations, their particular\r\nproperties determine the life and habits of the creature.\"[77] We are\r\nnot to explain, he says, the tusks of the _Babirussa_ by their\r\npossible use, but we must ask how it comes to have tusks. In the same\r\nway we must not suppose that a bull has horns in order to gore, but we\r\nmust investigate the process by which it comes to have horns to gore\r\nwith. This is the rigorous morphological view. On the other hand he\r\nadmits elsewhere that function may influence form. Apparently he did\r\nnot work out his ideas on this point to logical clearness, and Radl[78]\r\nis probably correct in saying that the following quotation with its\r\ndouble assertion represents most nearly Goethe's position:--\r\n\r\n\"Also bestimmt die Gestalt die Lebensweise des Thieres, Und die Weise\r\nzu leben, sie wirkt auf alle Gestalten Maechtig zurueck.\"[79]\r\n\r\nHis best piece of purely morphological work was his theory of the\r\nmetamorphosis of plants. Stripped of its vaguer elements, and of the\r\ncrude attempt to explain differences in the character of plant organs\r\nby differences in the degree of \"refinement\" of the sap supplied to\r\nthem, the theory is that stem-leaves, sepals, petals, and stamens are\r\nall identical members or appendages. These appendages differ from one\r\nanother only in shape and in degree of expansion, stem-leaves being\r\nexpanded, sepals contracted, petals expanded, and so on alternately.\r\nIt is equally correct to call a stamen a contracted petal, and a petal\r\nan expanded stamen, for no one of the organs is the type of the\r\nothers, but all equally are varieties of a single abstract\r\nplant-appendage.\r\n\r\nWhat Goethe considered he had proved for the appendages of plants he\r\nextended to all living things. Every living thing is a complex of\r\nliving independent beings, which \"der Idee, der Anlage nach,\" are the\r\nsame, but in appearance may be the same or similar, different or\r\nunlike.[80] Not only is there a primordial animal and a primordial\r\nplant, schematic forms to which all separate species are referable,\r\nbut the parts of each are themselves units, which \"der Idee nach,\" are\r\nidentical _inter se_. This fantasy can hardly be taken seriously as a\r\nscientific theory; it seems, however, to have been what guided Goethe\r\nin his \"discovery\" of the vertebral nature of the skull. Just as the\r\nfore limb can be homologised with the hind limb, so, reasoning by\r\nanalogy, the skull should be capable of being homologised with the\r\nvertebrae. To what ludicrous extremes this doctrine of the repetition\r\nof parts within the organism was pushed we shall see when we consider\r\nthe theories of the German transcendentalists of the early nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThough Goethe's morphological views were lacking in definiteness he\r\nhit upon one or two ideas which proved useful. Thus he enunciated the\r\n\"law of balance\" long before Etienne Geoffroy St Hilaire, the law\r\n\"that to no part can anything be added, without something being taken\r\naway from another part, and _vice versa_.\"[81] He saw, too, what a help\r\nto the interpretation of adult structure the study of the embryo would\r\nbe, for many bones which are fused in the adult are separate in the\r\nembryo.[82] This also was a point to which the later transcendentalists\r\ngave considerable attention.\r\n\r\nSo far we have spoken of Goethe as if he were merely the prophet of\r\nformal morphology; we have pointed out how he brought to clear\r\nexpression the morphological principle implicit in the idea of unity\r\nof type, and how he seized upon some important guiding ideas, such as\r\nthe principle of connections. But Goethe was not a formalist, and he\r\nwas very far from the static conception of life which is at the base\r\nof pure morphology. His interest was not in _Gestalt_ or fixed form,\r\n_Bildung_ or form change. He saw that _Gestalt_ was but a momentary\r\nphase of _Bildung_, and could be considered apart and in itself only\r\nby an abstraction fatal to all understanding of the living thing.\r\nMephistopheles scoffs at the scholars who would explain a living\r\ncreature by anatomising it:\r\n\r\n \"Dann hat er die Theile in seiner Hand,\r\n  Fehlt leider! nur das geistige Band.\"[83]\r\n\r\nGoethe kept clear of this mistake; he knew that the artist comes\r\nnearer to the truth than the analyst.\r\n\r\nIn the fragment entitled _Bildung und Umbildung organischer Naturen_\r\n(1807), introductory to a reprint of his paper on the \"Metamorphosis\r\nof Plants,\" we get an exposition of his general views on living\r\nthings. He points out there how we try to understand things by\r\nseparating them into their parts. We can, it is true, resolve the\r\norganism into its structural elements, but we cannot recompose it or\r\nendow it with life by joining up the parts. Hence we require some\r\nother means of understanding it. \"In all ages even among scientific\r\nmen there can be discerned a yearning to apprehend the living form as\r\nsuch, to grasp the connection of their external visible parts, to\r\ninterpret them as indications of the inner activity, and so, in a\r\ncertain measure, to master the whole conceptually.\" This science which\r\nshould discover the inner meaning of organic _Bildung_ is called\r\nMorphology.[84] In Morphology we should not speak of _Gestalt_ or fixed\r\nform, or if we do we should understand by it only a momentary phase of\r\n_Bildung_. Form is of interest not in itself but only as the\r\nmanifestation of the inner activity of the living being. Over\r\ndevelopment, he says elsewhere, there presides a formative force, a\r\n_bildende Kraft_ or _Bildungstrieb_, which works out the idea of the\r\norganism. Living things, in his view of them, strive to manifest an\r\nidea. They are Nature's works of art--and so, incidentally, they\r\nrequire an artist to interpret them.\r\n\r\nThis profound conception of the nature of life is applied not only to\r\nthe growing changing individual but also to the whole changing world\r\nof organisms. They are all manifestations of a living shaping power\r\nwhich moulds them. This shaping power, immanent in all life, is\r\nconceived to work according to a general plan, and so we get an\r\nexplanation of the fact that living things seem simply varieties of\r\none common type.\r\n\r\n\"If we once recognise,\" says Goethe, \"that the creative spirit brings\r\ninto being and shapes the evolution of the more perfect organic\r\ncreatures according to a general scheme, is it altogether impossible\r\nto represent this original plan if not to the senses at least to the\r\nmind...?\"[85]\r\n\r\nSuch an interpretation of the unity of plan reaches perhaps beyond the\r\nbounds of science.\r\n\r\n    [70] _See_ Kohlbrugge, \"Hist. krit.

Geoffrey made an experiment, unsuccessful but instructive. He tried\r\nto found a science of pure morphology; he failed: his failure showed,\r\nonce and for all, that a pure morphology of organic forms is\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nAlready, in 1796, in one of his earliest memoirs,[86] Geoffroy was\r\nguided by the idea that Nature has formed all living things upon one\r\nplan. Organs which seem anomalous are merely modifications of the\r\nnormal; the trunk of an elephant is formed by the excessively\r\nprolonged nostrils, the horn of a rhinoceros is simply a mass of\r\nadhering hairs. In general, however varied their form, all organs are\r\nsimply variations of a common scheme; Nature employs no new organs.\r\nOrgans which are rudimentary, such as the clavicles in the ostrich and\r\nthe nictitating membrane in man, bear witness to the unity of plan. In\r\nthis Geoffroy goes no further than his predecessors. They too had\r\nrecognised homologies of organs; they too had interpreted rudimentary\r\norgans as vestiges of an original plan.\r\n\r\nIn a series of papers published in 1807, Geoffroy took a further step,\r\nand sought to establish homologies which were not obvious--homologies,\r\ntoo, not so much of organs as of parts.\r\n\r\nThese memoirs (published in the _Annales du Museum d'Histoire\r\nnaturelle_, vols. ix. and x., 1807) dealt with the homology between\r\nthe bones of the pectoral fin and girdle in fish and the bones of the\r\narm and shoulder-girdle in higher Vertebrates, with the homologies of\r\nthe bones of the sternum, and with the determination of the pieces of\r\nthe skull, particularly in the crocodile. All Geoffroy's morphological\r\ndoctrine is found in them, but for the full expression of his views we\r\nmust take his chief work, the _Philosophie anatomique_, particularly\r\nthe first volume (1818). This volume contains, beside the important\r\n\"Discours preliminaire\" and \"Introduction\" which we shall presently\r\nconsider in detail, five memoirs, which deal with the various bones\r\nconnected with the respiratory organs in fishes (the bones of the\r\noperculum, of the hyoid, of the branchial arches, of the pectoral\r\ngirdle), and seek to discover their homologies with corresponding\r\nbones in air-breathing Vertebrates.\r\n\r\n\"Can the organisation of vertebrated animals be referred to one\r\nuniform type?\" This is the question with which the _Philosophie\r\nanatomique_ opens, the question to which the whole book is an answer.\r\nBut is it not generally acknowledged by naturalists that Vertebrates\r\nare built upon one uniform plan, that, for instance, the fore limb may\r\nbe modified for running, climbing, swimming, or flying, yet the\r\narrangement of the bones remain the same? How else could there be a\r\n\"natural method\" of classification?[87]\r\n\r\nBut the homologies so drawn repose upon a vague and confused feeling for\r\nlikenesses; they are not based upon an explicit principle. What general\r\nprinciple can be applied? \"Now it is evident that the sole general\r\nprinciple one can apply is given by the position, the relations, and the\r\ndependencies of the parts, that is to say, by what I name and include\r\nunder the term of _connections_.\" For instance, the part known as the\r\nhand in man and generally as the fore foot in other Vertebrates, is the\r\nfourth part in order in the anterior member, and its homologue can\r\nalways be recognised by this fact of its connections (p. xxvi.). The\r\nprinciple of connections serves as a guide in tracing an organ through\r\nall its functional transformations, for \"an organ can be deteriorated,\r\natrophied, annihilated, but not transposed\" (p. xxx.).\r\n\r\nIt is this principle which enables one to follow out in detail the\r\nfurther fundamental conception that in every Vertebrate there are found\r\nthe same \"organic materials,\" or units of construction. This conception,\r\nwhich Geoffroy calls the _Theorie des analogues_ (p. xxxii.), is clearly\r\none part of the old idea of the unity of type; it teaches the _unity of\r\ncomposition_ of organic beings, while the _Principe des connexions_ adds\r\nthe _unity of plan_.\r\n\r\nBoth conceptions are logically implicit in the vague notion of unity of\r\ntype; Geoffroy disengaged them, and pushed each to its logical extreme.\r\n\r\nMost of the ordinary homologies of structure in air-breathing\r\nVertebrates have already been seized, he continues, for they are more or\r\nless obvious, and many intermediate states exist (p. xxxiv.). But\r\nordinary methods of comparison fail when the attempt is made to\r\nhomologise the structure of fishes with that of air-breathing\r\nVertebrates, for the homologies are anything but obvious and no\r\nintermediate organs are found.\r\n\r\nMost air-breathing Vertebrates have a larynx, a trachea, and bronchi,\r\nwhich are absent in fish; and fish have many parts which seem to be\r\nabsent in higher Vertebrates. But apply the \"Theory of Analogues\"; it\r\nteaches that there can be no organ peculiar to fish and not found in\r\nother Vertebrates; apply the \"Principle of Connections,\" it will show\r\nwhich organs are homologous in the two types (p. xxxv.).\r\n\r\nComparative anatomists, with few exceptions, had hitherto taken man as\r\nthe type, and referred all structure to his; Geoffroy's principles led\r\nhim to give preference to no one animal in particular, but to seize upon\r\neach part in the species in which it reaches the maximum of its\r\ndevelopment (p. xxxvi.). He is thus led to refer all structures to a\r\ngeneralised abstract type. In this abstract type each organ exists at\r\nthe maximum of its development, each organ shows all its potentialities\r\nrealised. In a way, therefore, this type, this abstraction, gives the\r\nscheme of the possible transformations of each organ.\r\n\r\nIt is true Geoffroy does not refer to this \"Archetype\" in so many words,\r\nbut it must always have been vaguely present in his mind. He has this\r\nidea in his head when he says in one of his later works, \"There is,\r\nphilosophically speaking, only a single animal.\"[88] The \"single animal\"\r\nis simply the generalised type.\r\n\r\nHaving laid down his two principles Geoffroy goes on to apply them to\r\nthe difficult case of the comparison of the skeleton of fish with the\r\nskeleton of the higher Vertebrates. \"My present task is to demonstrate\r\nthat there is no part of the bony framework of fishes that cannot find\r\nits analogue in the other vertebrated animals.\"[89] It seems at first\r\nsight that many bones are peculiar to fish, formed expressly for\r\nperforming the functions which fish do not share with higher animals.\r\nThese are the bones connected with respiration--the operculum, the\r\nbranchiostegal rays, the branchial arches, and others. That the peculiar\r\nbones should be connected with the respiratory functions is only\r\nnatural, for the contrast between fish and higher Vertebrates is\r\nessentially a contrast between water-breathing and air-breathing\r\nanimals. Considering first the general form of the skeleton in fish, we\r\nare met at once with a difficulty; there is no obvious homologue in\r\nfishes of the neck, the trunk, and the abdomen of higher animals. What\r\napparently corresponds to the trunk is in fishes crowded close up under\r\nthe head. But, after all, it is not of the essence of the vertebrate\r\ntype to have the trunk and the abdomen attached at definite and\r\ninvariable distances along the vertebral column--that is a notion\r\nsurviving from the anatomy which made man its type. The \"trunk\" differs\r\nin position according to the class, in quadrupeds, birds, and fishes (p.\r\n9). Now, says Geoffroy, allow me this one hypothesis, that the trunk\r\nwith its organs can, as it were, move bodily along the vertebral column,\r\nso as to be found in one class near the front end of the vertebral\r\ncolumn, in another about the middle, and in a third near the end, then I\r\ncan show you in detail that the constituent parts of this trunk are\r\nfound in all classes to be invariably in the same positions relatively\r\nto one another (p. 10). It is important to note this hypothesis of a\r\n\"metastasis\" which Geoffroy makes, for it is the key to the\r\nunderstanding of many of the far-fetched homologies which he tries to\r\nestablish. It is, of course, clear that this hypothesis is in formal\r\ncontradiction with his principal hypothesis of the invariability of\r\nconnections, and that he, so to speak, gets a hold on his fish to apply\r\nhis principle of connections only by admitting at the very outset an\r\nexception to his primary principle. A further application of the\r\nhypothesis of metastasis will be noticed below in connection with the\r\ndetermination of the sternum of fishes. We note here an interpretation\r\nof the first metastasis in terms of functional adaptation. \"The constant\r\nand violent action of the tail, if it does not go so far as actually to\r\ndisplace and move forward the internal organs, at least fits in well\r\nwith an arrangement in which the organs are so disposed\" (p. 99).\r\n\r\nThe first memoir deals with the homologies of the opercular bones.\r\nGeoffroy considers that the external opening of the ear corresponds to\r\nthe external opening of the gill-chamber, which lies between the\r\noperculum and the pectoral girdle. The ear communicates with the buccal\r\ncavity by the Eustachian tube, so does the branchial chamber by means of\r\nthe gill-slits. The auditory chamber of higher Vertebrates is,\r\ntherefore, the homologue of the branchial chamber in fish; the opercular\r\nbones in fish and the ossicles of the ear in other Vertebrates stand in\r\nclose relation to this chamber; therefore the opercular bones are the\r\nhomologues of the ossicles of the ear, the interoperculum corresponding\r\nto the malleus, the suboperculum to the lenticular, the minute lower\r\npart of the suboperculum to the incus, the operculum to the stapes, and\r\nthe pre-operculum to the tympanic ring. In making these particular\r\ndeterminations Geoffroy professes to be led by his principle of\r\nconnections. The pre-operculum has, he says, the same connections with\r\nneighbouring bones as the tympanic bone in other Vertebrates, and the\r\nother pieces of the gill-cover are homologised with particular\r\near-ossicles according to the order in which they stand to one another.\r\nThe second memoir in the book deals with the sternum, and affords a very\r\ngood example of Geoffroy's method of dealing with the facts of\r\nstructure. We shall omit here any detailed reference to the other three\r\nmemoirs, which deal with the hyoid, with the branchial arches and the\r\nstructures which correspond in air-breathing Vertebrates, and with the\r\nbones of the shoulder-girdle.\r\n\r\nIn the memoir on the sternum Geoffroy's first care is to arrive at a\r\ndefinition of what a sternum is. He defines it partly by its functions,\r\npartly by its connections, as the system of bones which covers and\r\nprotects the thorax, and gives attachment to certain groups of muscles.\r\n\r\nThe most highly developed sternum (according to this definition) is the\r\nplastron of the tortoise, whose structure it dominates (p. 103). It is\r\nimportant, therefore, to determine of how many bones the plastron is\r\ncomposed, since the full number of elementary parts of which an organ is\r\ncomposed is best seen when the organ is at the maximum of its\r\ndevelopment. There are nine bones in the plastron of the tortoise. \"The\r\nconclusion to be drawn from this is that every sternum, provided that it\r\nis not inhibited in its development by some obstacle, is composed of\r\n_nine elementary parts_\" (p. 105). These nine bones are in Geoffroy's\r\nnomenclature, the episternals, the hyosternals, the hyposternals, the\r\nxiphisternals, which are all paired bones, and the entosternal, which is\r\nunpaired. The arrangement of them is in the tortoise:--\r\n\r\nEpisternal---------------------------Episternal\r\n    |\\__                               __/|\r\n    |   \\__                         __/   |\r\n    |      \\__                   __/      |\r\n    |         \\__ Entosternal __/         |\r\n    |       __/                 \\__       |\r\n    |    __/                       \\__    |\r\n    | __/                             \\__ |\r\n    |/                                   \\|\r\nHyosternal                           Hyosternal\r\n    |                                     |\r\n    |                                     |\r\n    |                                     |\r\n    |                                     |\r\nHyposternal-------------------------Hyposternal\r\n    |                                     |\r\n    |                                     |\r\n    |                                     |\r\n    |                                     |\r\nXiphisternal------------------------Xiphisternal.\r\n\r\nThe articulations in the tortoise are indicated by the connecting\r\nlines. Geoffroy tries to show that the sternum in other animals is\r\ncomposed of these nine bones, or at least of a certain number of them,\r\nalways in the same invariable relative positions. Thus in birds the\r\nsternum consists of five pieces, of a huge keeled entosternal, and of\r\ntwo \"annexes\" on either side, which are the hyo-and hyposternals.\r\nThese are separate only in young birds. Occasionally, especially in\r\nyoung birds, rudiments of episternals and xiphisternals also occur.\r\nThe minuteness of the episternals and the xiphisternals may be\r\nattributed to the gigantic size of the entosternal, in accordance with\r\nthe _Loi de balancement_. In the other air-breathing Vertebrates the\r\nnine sternal elements can according to Geoffroy be discovered without\r\ngreat difficulty. But when we come to the determination of the sternum\r\nin fishes, difficulties abound, which Geoffroy solves in the following\r\nway. He points out that between the clavicles (_cleithra_) and the\r\nhyoid bone (_basihyal_) in fishes there is a long median bone\r\n(_urohyal_) which is attached in front by two strong tendons to the\r\nhorns of the hyoid and is free behind (see Fig. 1). Gouan (1720) had\r\nseen in this bone the homologue of the sternum. Geoffroy adopts this\r\nview, but considers that this bone alone cannot represent the whole\r\nsternum. He finds the representatives of other bones of the sternum in\r\nthe large bones (_epihyal_ and _ceratohyal_, or the two pieces of the\r\n_ceratohyal_) which are comprised in the hyoid arch. But he is\r\nimmediately met by the difficulty that this complex of bones is\r\nsituated in front of the pectoral girdle, whereas the sternum in\r\nhigher Vertebrates lies behind the pectoral girdle. He reflects,\r\nhowever, that the gills of fish, situated in front of the clavicles,\r\nare merely the lungs under another name. The gills have become shifted\r\nforward by a metastasis similar to that which brought the whole\r\nthoracic organs far forward in fish. This being so, their supporting\r\nelements, the sternum and the ribs, must have moved with them, and are\r\nhence to be found in front of the pectoral girdle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Hyoid Arch of the Conger. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nGeoffroy's next step is to point out that the only possible homologues\r\nof sternal ribs are the branchiostegal rays, which arise from the large\r\nbones of the hyoid arch. If these are sternal ribs, the bones to which\r\nthey are attached must be the hyo- and hyposternals or \"annexes,\" the\r\nbones from which in birds the ribs take their origin.\r\n\r\nThe unpaired sternal bone (_urohyal_) cannot be homologous with the\r\nentosternal, for it has no connections with the annexes. He decides that\r\nit must represent the episternals, for in some young birds there is a\r\ntwo-headed episternal to which two strong tendons are attached, just in\r\nthe same way as the unpaired piece in fish is bound to the bones of the\r\nhyoid by two tendons. \"Thus it is not the sternum as a whole that has\r\nshifted in front of the clavicles and covered with its side pieces the\r\ngills placed there; it is a piece exclusively piscine, in the sense that\r\nit is only in the class of fishes that it reaches the _maximum_ of its\r\ndevelopment\" (p. 83).\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the sternum in all four vertebrate classes is composed of the\r\nsame elements, arranged always in the same way. \"One is ... led to the\r\nconception of an ideal type of sternum for all Vertebrates, which then,\r\nconsidered from a lower standpoint, resolves itself into several\r\nsecondary forms according as the whole or the majority of the\r\nconstituent materials are employed, or even as these elements come to\r\nchange their respective dimensions or proportions\" (p. 134). As to the\r\nelementary constituents, \"they give proof of individuality, and\r\nsometimes even, in certain abnormalities, of independence, and rise to\r\nthe level of primary organisatory materials\" (p. 132). What holds good\r\nfor the sternum holds good for other organs--and accordingly the unity\r\nof plan and composition can be demonstrated for all the organs of\r\nVertebrates.\r\n\r\nSoon after the publication of the _Philosophie anatomique_ (1818)\r\nGeoffroy went further in his search for unity, and maintained that the\r\nstructure of insects and Crustacea could be reduced to the vertebrate\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nHe proposed to replace Cuvier's classification of the animal kingdom\r\ninto the four large groups, Vertebrata, Mollusca, Articulata, and\r\nRadiata by the following classification:--[90]\r\n\r\n                Hauts-Vertebres (Vertebrata, Cuv.).\r\n     Vertebres /\r\n               \\\r\n                Dermo-Vertebres (Articulata, Cuv.).\r\n\r\n\r\n                Mollusques (Mollusca, Cuv.).\r\n   Invertebres /\r\n               \\\r\n                Rayonnes (Radiata, Cuv.).\r\n\r\nThe idea upon which is based the comparison of Articulates with\r\nVertebrates is that each skeletal segment of Articulates is a vertebra.\r\nIn the Hauts-vertebres the vertebrae are internal; in the\r\nDermo-vertebres they are external. \"_Every animal lives either outside\r\nor inside its vertebral column_.\"[91] The essence of a vertebra is not\r\nits form, nor its function, but its composition from four elementary\r\npieces which unite round a central space (_Isis, loc. cit._, p. 532).\r\nSerres had shown that in the higher animals every vertebra is formed\r\nfrom four centres of ossification, that the body of the vertebra is at\r\nfirst tubular, and that afterwards it becomes filled up. In lobsters and\r\ncrabs each segment is composed of four elementary pieces, as may be seen\r\nmost easily in young ones. \"Accordingly each segment corresponds to a\r\ntrue vertebra in composition: there is the same number of 'materials,'\r\nthe same order in the course of ossification, the same kind of\r\narticulation, the same annular arrangement, the same empty space in the\r\nmiddle\" (p. 534). The only difference is that in Articulates the central\r\nspace is very great and contains all the organs of the body, whereas in\r\nthe higher Vertebrates the body of the vertebra becomes completely\r\nfilled up. In the thoracic region of Crustacea it is not the whole\r\nsegment with part of the carapace which corresponds to a vertebra, but\r\nmerely the part round the ventral nerve-cord (endophragmal skeleton).\r\n\r\nIf the skeleton of the segment in Articulates corresponds to the body of\r\na vertebra and is here external, then the appendages of the Articulate\r\nmust correspond to ribs (p. 538). The full development of this thought\r\nis found in a Memoir of 1822, \"Sur la vertebre.\"[92] He takes as the\r\ntypical vertebra that of a Pleuronectid, probably the turbot. His\r\noriginal figure is reproduced (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--\"Vertebra\" of a Pleuronectid. (After Geoffroy.)]\r\n\r\nHe includes as part of the vertebra not only the neural (e', e'') and\r\nhaemal (o', o'') arches, but also, above and below these, the radialia\r\n(a'', u') and the fin-rays (a', u''). (Neither the radialia nor the\r\nfin-rays are, by the way, in the same transverse plane as the body of\r\nthe vertebra). Every vertebra, he considers, contains these nine\r\npieces--the cycleal (or body), the two perials (e', e'') and the two\r\nepials (a', a'') above, the two paraals (o', o'') and the two cataals (u',\r\nu'') below. The epials and the cataals are in reality paired bones which\r\nin fish mount one on top of the other to support the median fins. In the\r\ncranial region--the skull is formed of modified vertebrae--the epials\r\nand perials open out so as to form the walls and roof of the brain; in\r\nthe thoracic region the paraals and cataals reach their maximum of\r\ndevelopment and perform the same service for the thoracic organs, the\r\nparaals becoming vertebral, and the cataals sternal, ribs.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in Arthropods the body of the vertebra (cycleal) forms\r\nthe open ring of the segment, which lies immediately under the skin, the\r\nvertebral tube coinciding with the epidermal tube. The homologues of the\r\nother eight pieces of the vertebra must accordingly be sought in the\r\nexternal appendages. At first sight there seems here a contradiction of\r\nthe principle of connections, for the appendages in Arthropods are\r\nlateral, whereas the paired bones of the vertebra are dorsal and\r\nventral. But there is in reality no contradiction, for \"what our law of\r\nconnections absolutely requires is that all organs, whether internal or\r\nexternal, should stand to one another in the same relations; but it is\r\nall one whether the box (_coffre_) that encloses them lies with this or\r\nthat side on the ground. What similarities in the organisation of man\r\nand the digitate mammals, and yet what differences between their\r\nattitudes when standing! The same holds true as regards the normal\r\nattitudes of the pleuronectids and the other fishes\" (p. 107).\r\n\r\nThe exact way in which Geoffroy homologised the parts of the appendages\r\nin Arthropods with the paired pieces of the typical vertebra is best\r\nshown by the reproduction of his figure of an abdominal segment of the\r\nlobster (Fig. 3), in which the parts homologous with those represented\r\nin the figure of the typical vertebra (Fig. 2) are indicated by the same\r\nletters. The ingenuity of the comparison is astonishing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Abdominal Segment of the Lobster. (After\r\nGeoffroy.)]\r\n\r\nThe comparison of the Arthropod with the Vertebrate is extended also to\r\nthe internal organs. The internal organs of the Arthropod are shown to\r\nstand in the same order to one another as in the Vertebrate, only the\r\norgans are inverted. Thus the nervous system is dorsal in the\r\nVertebrate, ventral in the Arthropod. Turn the Arthropod on its back and\r\nthe relative positions of the systems of organs are the same as in the\r\nVertebrate. The relation of the organs to the external tube is of course\r\ndifferent in Arthropods and Vertebrates, but this is no contradiction of\r\nthe principle of connections. \"Such a tube, although it is the organs\r\nessential to life that it contains, can yet behave in different ways\r\nwith regard to the mass of these organs: the principle of connections\r\ndemands only that all the organs maintain with one another fixed and\r\ndefinite relations; but the principle would be in no way invalidated if\r\nthe whole mass had rotated inside the tube\" (p. 112).\r\n\r\nGeoffroy pushed the analogy between Arthropods and Vertebrates very far,\r\nfor he asserted that every piece in the skeleton of an insect was\r\nhomologous with some bone in Vertebrates, that it stood always in its\r\nproper place, and remained faithful to at least one of its\r\nconnections.[93] It does not appear that he attempted to prove in detail\r\nthis very big assumption, but the beginnings of a detailed comparison\r\nare found in the paper of 1820, _Sur l'organisation des insectes_. Six\r\nsegments are distinguished in an insect--the head, the three divisions\r\nof the thorax, the abdomen, and the terminal segment of the abdomen (p.\r\n455).\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of the insect's head is said to correspond to the bones of\r\nthe face, to the bones of the cerebrum and to the hyoid of higher\r\nVertebrates, the skeleton of the prothorax to the bones of the\r\ncerebellum, of the palate, and the pieces of the larynx, the skeleton of\r\nthe mesothorax to the parietals, interparietals, and opercular bones,\r\nand that of the metathorax to the skeleton of the thorax of Vertebrates.\r\nThe pieces of the abdomen and of the terminal segment correspond to the\r\nbones of the abdomen and coccyx (p. 458). It does not need the\r\nsubsequent likening of the hind wings of insects to the air bladder of\r\nfish, and of the stigmata to the pores of the lateral line, to convince\r\none finally of the fancifulness of the whole comparison.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 two young naturalists, Meyranx and Laurencet, presented to the\r\nAcademie des Sciences a memoir in which they likened a Cephalopod to a\r\nVertebrate bent back at the level of the umbilicus, saying that the\r\nVertebrate in this position had all its organs in the same order as in\r\nthe Cephalopod. Geoffroy took up this idea with enthusiasm, seeing in it\r\na further application of his master-idea of the unity of plan and\r\ncomposition. By means of this comparison Mollusca definitely took their\r\nplace in the _Echelle des etres_, after the Articulata, just as Geoffroy\r\nhad maintained in 1820, saying that crabs formed a link between the\r\nother Crustacea and the molluscs.[94] The comparison brought him nearer\r\nto the end he had in view, the reference of all animal structure to one\r\nsingle type.\r\n\r\nBut in championing the memoir of Meyranx and Laurencet, Geoffroy found\r\nhimself in direct antagonism with Cuvier, who held that his four\r\n\"Embranchements\" had each a separate and distinct plan of structure. In\r\na paper read to the Academy in February 1830,[95] Cuvier easily\r\ndemolished the crude comparison of the Cephalopod to the Vertebrate. He\r\ngave diagrams of the internal organs of a Cephalopod and of a Vertebrate\r\nbent back in the manner indicated by Meyranx and Laurencet, and he\r\nshowed in detail that the arrangement of the main organs was quite\r\ndifferent, that the likeness would have been much greater if the\r\nCephalopod had been likened to a Vertebrate doubled up the other way,[96]\r\nbut that even then the arrangement of the organs would not be the same.\r\nThe organs, too, of the Cephalopod are differently constructed. He sums\r\nup his criticism by saying:--\"I give true and summary expression to all\r\nthese facts when I say that Cephalopods have several organs in common\r\nwith Vertebrates, which fulfil in either case similar functions, but\r\nthat these organs are differently arranged with respect to one another,\r\nand often constructed in a different way; that they are in Cephalopods\r\naccompanied by several other organs which Vertebrates do not possess,\r\nwhilst the latter on their side have many organs which Cephalopods lack\"\r\n(p. 257). Geoffroy could not accept this commonsense view of the matter,\r\nbut made a fight for his transcendental theories. This was the beginning\r\nof the famous controversy between Geoffroy and Cuvier which so excited\r\nthe interest of Goethe. It was a struggle between \"comparative anatomy\"\r\nand \"morphology,\" between the commonsense teleological view of structure\r\nand the abstract, transcendental. Geoffroy brought forward all his\r\ntheories on the homology of the skeleton of fish with the skeleton of\r\nhigher Vertebrates, and tried to prove by them his great principle of\r\nthe unity of plan and composition; Cuvier took Geoffroy's homologies one\r\nby one, and showed how very slight was their foundation. Cuvier was on\r\nsure ground in insisting upon the observable diversities of structural\r\ntype, and his vast knowledge enabled him to score a decisive victory.[97]\r\n\r\nThe controversy was not, as we are sometimes told, a controversy between\r\na believer in evolution and an upholder of the fixity of species,\r\nalthough it raised a question upon which evolution theory was to throw\r\nsome light.\r\n\r\nIn these Darwinian days Geoffroy has reaped a little posthumous glory as\r\nan early believer in evolution. That he did believe in evolution to a\r\nlimited extent is certain; that his theory of evolution was, as it were,\r\na by-product of his life-work, is also certain. Geoffroy was primarily a\r\nmorphologist and a seeker after the unity hidden under the diversity of\r\norganic form. His theory of evolution had as good as no influence upon\r\nhis morphology, for he did not to any extent interpret unity of plan as\r\nbeing due to community of descent. His morphological, non-evolutionary\r\nstandpoint comes out quite clearly in several places in the _Philosophie\r\nanatomique_. He does not derive the structure of the higher Vertebrates\r\nfrom the simpler structure of the lower, but when he finds in fish a\r\npart at the maximum of its development, he speaks of the same part,\r\nrudimentary in the higher forms, as being, as it were, held in reserve\r\nfor use in the fish. Thus, speaking of the episternal in fish which\r\nforms the central piece of its sternum, he says, \"it is a bone that is\r\nrudimentary in birds (one might almost add a bone that is held in\r\nreserve in birds for this fate) which is destined to form in the centre\r\nthe principal keel of this new machine\" (p. 84). Again, with reference\r\nto the homology of the ossicles of the ear with the opercular bones in\r\nfish, \"employing other resources equally hidden and rudimentary, Nature\r\nmakes profitable use of the four tiny ossicles lodged in the auditory\r\npassage, and, raising them in fish to the greatest possible dimensions,\r\nforms from them these broad opercula....\" (p. 85). Or you may take it\r\nthe other way about, and start from the organisation of fishes;\r\nopercular bones are of no use to air-breathing animals, so they dwindle\r\naway, and are pressed into the service of the ear, although they are of\r\nlittle use in hearing (p. 46).\r\n\r\nThere is here no thought of evolution; in later years, however, his\r\nresearches upon fossil crocodilians led him to consider the possibility\r\nthat the living species were descended from the antediluvian. For the\r\nfactors of the transformation he refers to Lamarck's hypotheses.[98] In a\r\nmemoir of 1828,[99] dealing with the possible genetic relation of living\r\nto fossil species, he still regards the question as more or less open.\r\nAlthough fossil species are mostly different from living species are we\r\ntherefore to conclude, he asks, that they are not the ancestors of the\r\npresent day forms? \"The contrary idea arises more naturally in the mind;\r\nfor otherwise the six-days' creation would have had to be repeated and\r\nnew beings produced by a fresh creation. Now this proposition, contrary\r\nas it is to the most ancient historical traditions, is inadmissible\" (p.\r\n210). It is sufficiently clear from this quotation that Geoffroy was\r\nthinking only of a transformation of the antediluvian species created by\r\nGod, and by no means of an evolution of all species from one primitive\r\ntype. In matters of religion Geoffroy was orthodox. He goes on to point\r\nout how great a resemblance there is in essential structure between\r\nfossil and living species. All find their place in one scheme of\r\nclassification; does it not seem that all are modifications \"of one\r\nsingle being, of that abstract being or common type, which it is always\r\npossible to denote by the same name?\" (p. 211). This type is abstract,\r\nnot actual, and it is certainly not conceived as an original ancestor of\r\nall animals.\r\n\r\nThe fullest development of Geoffroy's views on evolution is found in his\r\nmemoir \"Le degre d'influence du monde ambiant pour modifier les formes\r\nanimales.\"[100] Here the relation of his evolution-theory to his\r\nmorphology is pointed out. The principle of unity of plan and\r\ncomposition cannot be the final goal of zoology; there must follow on it\r\na philosophical study of the _differences_ between organic forms. The\r\ncauses of these differences are to be found in the environment (pp.\r\n66-7). Geoffroy seems here to be moving from a pure to a causal\r\nmorphology. It is probable, he continues, that living species have\r\ndescended by uninterrupted generation from the antediluvian species (p.\r\n74), and that they have in the process become modified through external\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nNow of all functions respiration is the most important, and upon\r\nrespiration everything is regulated. \"If it be admitted that the slow\r\nprogression of the centuries has brought in its train successive changes\r\nin the proportion of the different elements of the atmosphere, it\r\nfollows as a rigorously necessary consequence that the organisation has\r\nbeen proportionately influenced by them\" (p. 76). The respiratory milieu\r\nchanges, the species change with it, or are eliminated (p. 79). We may\r\nsee, perhaps, in the stress which Geoffroy lays upon respiration and the\r\nrespiratory milieu a result of his constant obsession with the\r\ncomparison of fish with air-breathing Vertebrates.\r\n\r\nIn the first geological period, we read in another Memoir of the same\r\nyear,[101] when ammonites and _Gryphaea_ flourished, hot-blooded animals\r\nwith lungs could not exist. \"A lung constructed like that of mammals and\r\nbirds would not have been adapted to the essence of the respiratory\r\nelement such as in my conception of it the system of the environing air\r\nused to be\"[102] (p. 58).\r\n\r\nGeoffroy does not tell us exactly how the milieu is to act upon the\r\norganism; the whole theory is little more than a sketch and a pointing\r\nout of the way for future research--and in this prophetic enough. The\r\naction of external agents was apparently considered as physical, and no\r\npower of active adaptation was ascribed to the organism.\r\n\r\nFrom a passage in the memoir \"Sur la Vertebre\" we may perhaps infer that\r\nhe believed increasing complexity of structure to be due to a\r\nrealisation of potentialities, to the development of parts present in\r\nthe lower animals only in potency--\"the organisation ... only awaits\r\nfavourable conditions to rise, by addition of parts, from the simplicity\r\nof the first formations to the complication of the creatures at the head\r\nof the scale\" (p. 112). Evolution takes place as the environment allows,\r\nand in a sense in opposition to the environment.\r\n\r\nHe believed in saltatory evolution, for he considered that the lower\r\noviparous Vertebrates could not be transformed into birds by slow\r\nmodification, but only by a sudden transformation of their lungs, which\r\nwould bring about the other characteristics of birds (p. 80). He\r\nconsidered, too, that transformations could arise by means of monstrous\r\ndevelopment (p. 86). In this connection the experiments which he made on\r\nthe hen's egg[103] in order to produce artificial monstrosities are\r\nsignificant, though his purpose was rather to obtain proof of the\r\ninadequacy of the preformation hypothesis.[104]\r\n\r\nIt seems probable enough that if Geoffroy had developed his views on\r\nevolution he would finally have been led to interpret unity of plan in\r\nterms of genetic relationship. But as it was he remained at his\r\nmorphological standpoint. He did not interpret rudimentary organs as\r\nuseless heritages of the past; he preferred to think that Nature had\r\nprepared double means for the same function, one or other being\r\npredominant according as the animal lived in the water or on the land.\r\n\"To the animal that lives exclusively in the air Nature has granted an\r\norganisation suited to this mode of respiration, without however\r\nsuppressing the other corresponding means, that is to say, without\r\ndepriving it of a second system which is applicable only to the mode of\r\nrespiration by the intermediary of water, and _vice versa_.\"[105]\r\n\r\nHe seems, in one instance at least, to have hit upon the root-idea of\r\nthe biogenetic law, but he was far from appreciating its significance.\r\nHe recognised that an amphibian in its development passed through a\r\nstage when it was in all essentials similar to a fish, and he saw in\r\nthis visible transformation a picture of the evolutionary\r\ntransformation. \"An amphibian,\" he writes,[106] \"is at first a fish under\r\nthe name of tadpole, and then a reptile [_sic_] under that of frog....\r\nIn this observed fact is realised what we have above represented as an\r\nhypothesis, the transformation of one organic stage into the stage\r\nimmediately superior.\" But it is not clear that he considered the\r\ndevelopment of the amphibian to be a _repetition_ of its ancestral\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nHe went, however, a certain length towards recognising the main\r\nprinciple of a law which was a commonplace of German transcendental\r\nthought, and was developed later by his disciple E. Serres, the law that\r\nthe higher animals repeat during their development the main features of\r\nthe adult organisation of animals lower in the scale. Thus he compared\r\nfish as regards certain parts of their structure with the foetus of\r\nmammals. He compared also Articulates with embryonic Vertebrates in\r\nrespect of their vertebrae, for in the higher Vertebrates the body of the\r\nvertebra is tubular at an early stage of development, and in Articulates\r\nthe body of the vertebra remains tubular permanently (_supra_, p. 61).\r\nAs regards their vertebrae, \"insects occupy a place in the series of the\r\nages and developments of the vertebrate animals, that is to say, they\r\nrealise one of the states of their embryo, as fishes do one of the\r\nstates of their foetal condition.\"[107]\r\n\r\nThis idea was destined to exercise a great influence upon the\r\ndevelopment of morphology. A further development of the thought is that\r\ncertain abnormalities in the higher animals, resulting from arrest of\r\ndevelopment, represent states of organisation which are permanent in the\r\nlower animals.[108]\r\n\r\nSo far we have considered Geoffroy's theories in their application to\r\nthe facts. We go on to discuss the theories themselves, and the general\r\nconception of living things which underlies them.\r\n\r\nThe principle of unity of plan and composition is the keynote of\r\nGeoffroy's work. It states that the same materials of organisation are\r\nto be found in all animals, and that these materials stand always in the\r\nsame general spatial relations to one another. The \"materials of\r\norganisation\" are not necessarily organs in the physiological sense, and\r\nindeed the principle of the unity of plan cannot be upheld if the unity\r\nhas reference to organs only. This became clear to Geoffroy, especially\r\nin his later years. In 1835 he wrote, speaking of the principle of the\r\nunity of plan, \"I have, moreover, regenerated this principle, and\r\nobtained for it universality of application, by showing that it is not\r\nalways the organs as a whole, but merely the materials composing each\r\norgan, that can be reduced to unity.\"[109] Even in the _Philosophie\r\nanatomique_ he deals rather with parts than with organs; he deals, for\r\ninstance, with the elementary parts of the sternum, not with the organ\r\n\"sternum\" in its totality. The functions of the sternum vary, and the\r\nprimary protective function of the sternum may be assumed by quite other\r\nparts, _e.g._, by the clavicles in fish, which protect the heart.[110]\r\n\r\nTrue homologies can be established between materials of organisation but\r\nnot always between organs, which may be composed of different\r\n\"materials.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost as a corollary to this comes the further view that form is of\r\nlittle importance in determining homologies. An organ is essentially an\r\ninstrument for doing a particular kind of work, and its form is\r\ndetermined by its function. Organs which perform the same function are\r\nusually similar in form though the elementary materials composing them\r\nmay be different. This is seen in many cases of convergence. Organs,\r\ntherefore, which perform the same function and are similar in external\r\nform are not necessary homologous. Conversely, the same complex of\r\nmaterials, say a fore limb, may take on the most varied shapes according\r\nas the function of the organ changes--but homology remains though form\r\nchanges. Accordingly, form is one of the least important elements to be\r\nconsidered in determining a homology. \"Nature,\" he wrote in one of his\r\nearly papers, \"tends to repeat the same organs in the same number and in\r\nthe same relations, and varies to infinity only their form. In\r\naccordance with this principle I shall have to draw my conclusions, in\r\nthe determining the bones of the fish's skull, not from a consideration\r\nof their form, but from a consideration of their connections.\"[111]\r\n\r\nAgain, after comparing a vertebra of the Aurochs with an abdominal\r\nsegment of the crab, he says, \"I have insisted upon an identity which\r\nhas extended to the least important relation of all, that of form.\"[112]\r\n\r\nGeoffroy's morphological units or materials of organisation were in the\r\ncase of the skeleton--with which his researches principally deal--the\r\nsingle bones. But the interesting point is that he sought his\r\nskeleton-units in the embryo, and considered each separate centre of\r\nossification as a separate bone. Coalescence of bones originally\r\nseparate is one of the most usual events in development, and it is an\r\noccurrence which, more than any other, tends to obscure homologies.\r\nBecause of its coalescence with the maxillaries, the intermaxillary in\r\nman was not discovered until Vicq d'Azyr and Goethe found it separate in\r\nthe embryo. Apparently quite independently of Goethe, Geoffroy hit upon\r\nthis plan of seeking in the embryo the primary elements or materials of\r\norganisation. In an early paper on the skull of Vertebrates,[113] where he\r\nis concerned with showing that each bone of the fish's skull has its\r\nhomologue in the skull of higher Vertebrates, he is faced with the\r\ndifficulty that the skull of the fish has more bones than the skull of\r\nhigher Vertebrates. \"Having had the inspiration,\" he writes, \"to reckon\r\nas many bones as there are distinct centres of ossification, and having\r\nmade a consistent trial of this method, I have been able to appreciate\r\nthe correctness of the idea: fish, in their earliest stages, are in the\r\nsame conditions relatively to their development as the foetuses of\r\nmammals, and hence bear out the theory\" (p. 344). So, too, in dealing\r\nwith the homologies of the sternal elements (_supra_, p. 57) he treats\r\nas separate bones the \"annexes\" of the sternum in birds, though these\r\nare separate only in the young.\r\n\r\nIf the same materials of organisation are present in all animals, and if\r\nthey are arranged always in the same positions relatively to one\r\nanother, how does it come about that animal forms are so varied, what\r\nexplanation can be offered of the diversities of organic structure?\r\nGeoffroy's main answer to this question is his _Loi de balancement_. The\r\nlaw was enunciated by him already in 1807.[114] We take the following\r\nquotation, which represents his thought most nearly, from the _Cours de\r\nl'histoire naturelle des Mammiferes_ (1829). \"According to our manner of\r\nregarding the organisation of mammals, there is only a single animal\r\nmodified by the inverse reciprocal variation of all or some of its\r\nparts. Now, from the fact that there is only one single general animal,\r\nit follows that for each section of its components or for each of its\r\norgans there is available only a given quantity of formative materials.\r\nNow suppose that the distribution of these materials has not been made\r\nin such a way as to ensure an exact equilibrium between all the parts\r\nconcerned, one organ will get more than its share, another less. My law\r\nof the compensation of organs is founded on these principles\" (i.,\r\n_Lecon_ 16, p. 12). \"The atrophy of one organ turns to the profit of\r\nanother; and the reason why this cannot be otherwise is simple, it is\r\nbecause there is not an unlimited supply of the substance required for\r\neach special purpose.\"[115] The nutritive material available is limited\r\nfor each species; if one part gets more than its share the other parts\r\nmust get less--that is all the law means. As an example, take the\r\nminuteness of the episternals and xiphisternals in birds, as contrasted\r\nwith the huge size of the entosternal. \"The minuteness of the\r\nepisternals and xiphisternals might be imputed to this gigantic piece\r\ndiverting to its own profit the nutritive fluid, since the bigger it is\r\nthe smaller these are.\"[116]\r\n\r\nOne has constantly to remember in dealing with Geoffroy's theories that\r\nhe was not an evolutionist, but purely a morphologist. It is therefore,\r\nperhaps, to ask too much to require of him an explanation of the causes\r\nof diversity. The morphologist describes, classifies, generalises; he\r\ndoes not seek for causes. But we must leave this question aside in order\r\nto discuss how far Geoffroy's theory of the unity of plan and\r\ncomposition fits the facts. As Geoffroy himself admitted on several\r\noccasions, his theory was an _a priori_ one, a theory hit upon by hasty\r\ninduction, then erected into a principle and imposed upon the facts. No\r\nmore than Goethe did he extract his principle from a sufficient mass of\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nNow he found his theory to be in its pure form unworkable; he found, for\r\nexample, that the skeleton of fishes could not be compared directly,\r\nbone for bone, with the skeleton of higher Vertebrates; he had to admit\r\ndifferences of position of whole sets of organs in the two groups, he\r\nhad to admit various _metastases_, before he could bring the skeleton of\r\nfish into line. And these metastases are due to functional\r\nrequirements--for example, the forward position of sternum and thoracic\r\norgans in fish is an adaptation to swimming.\r\n\r\nSo he does not so much demonstrate the unity of plan of whole organisms\r\nas the unity of plan of particular corresponding parts of them. Thus he\r\ndoes not prove or attempt to prove that Articulates are in all points\r\nlike Vertebrates, but simply that their skeleton is built upon the same\r\nplan as that of Vertebrates. The rest of the organs, while still\r\ncomparable with the organs of Vertebrates, stand in different relations\r\nto the skeleton. An Articulate therefore, on his own showing, is not,\r\n_as a whole_, built upon the same general structural plan as a\r\nVertebrate.\r\n\r\nFurther, he does not always remain true to his principles, for he does\r\nnot establish homologies of parts entirely by their connections but\r\nsometimes by their functions as well. Thus the sternum, or rather the\r\ncomplex of sternal elements, is defined and discovered in particular\r\ncases not by its connections only but also by its functions. The\r\nframework of the gills is homologised part by part with the framework of\r\nthe lungs, not because the relations of the framework to the rest of the\r\nskeleton are the same in fish and air-breathing Vertebrates, but simply\r\nbecause gills are considered the equivalents of lungs--a comparison\r\nwhich is purely physiological.\r\n\r\nEven with these concessions to the functional view of living things,\r\nGeoffroy was unable to make good his contention that all animals are\r\nbuilt upon the same plan. His arguments failed to carry conviction to\r\nhis contemporaries, and Cuvier in particular subjected them to\r\ndestructive, and indeed final, criticism.\r\n\r\nThe paper, already referred to, in which Cuvier disposed of the\r\ntranscendentalists' comparison of Cephalopods and Vertebrates is of\r\ngreat significance, for it states in the clearest way the radical\r\nopposition between the functional and the formal attitudes to living\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nCuvier points out that if by unity of composition is meant identity,\r\nthen the statement that all animals show the same composition is simply\r\nnot true--compare a polyp with a man!--on the other hand, if by unity is\r\nmeant simply resemblance or homology, the statement is true within\r\ncertain limits, but it has been employed as a principle since the days\r\nof Aristotle, and the theory of unity of composition is original only in\r\nso far as it is false. He admits, however, that Geoffroy has seized upon\r\nmany hidden homologies, especially by his valuable discovery of the\r\nimportance of foetal structure. In all this Cuvier is undoubtedly right.\r\nUnity of plan and composition, as Geoffroy conceived it, simply does not\r\nexist. Cuvier goes on to say that this principle of Geoffroy's, in the\r\ngreatly modified form in which it can be accepted, and has been accepted\r\nfrom the dawn of zoology, is not the sole and unique principle of the\r\nscience. On the contrary, it is merely a subordinate principle,\r\nsubordinate to a higher and more fruitful principle, that, namely, of\r\nthe conditions of existence, of the adaptation (_convenance_) of the\r\nparts, of the co-ordination of the parts for the role which the animal\r\nis to play in Nature. \"That is the true philosophical principle,\" he\r\nsays, \"whence may be deduced the possibility of certain resemblances,\r\nthe impossibility of certain others; it is the rational principle from\r\nwhich follows the principle of the unity of plan and composition, and in\r\nwhich at the same time it finds those limits, which some would like to\r\ndisregard\" (p. 248).\r\n\r\nGeoffroy's position is the direct contrary. He holds that the principle\r\nof the unity of plan and composition is the true base of natural\r\nhistory,[117] and that this unity limits the possible transformations of\r\nthe organism. Thus, speaking of the influence of the respiratory medium,\r\nhe says, \"All the same this influence of the external world, if it has\r\never become a cause which disturbed organisation, must necessarily have\r\nbeen confined within fairly narrow limits; animals must have opposed to\r\nit certain conditions inherent to their nature, the existence of the\r\nsame materials composing them, and a manifest tendency to resemble one\r\nanother, and to reproduce invariably the same primordial type.\"[118] Unity\r\nof plan and composition is, on this view, prior to adaptation and limits\r\nadaptation. Cuvier's view, on the contrary, is that the necessity of\r\nfunctional and ecological adaptation accounts for the repetition of the\r\nsame types of structure. There are, of all the possible combinations of\r\norgans, only a few viable types--those whose structure is adapted to\r\ntheir life. Therefore it is reasonable that these few types should be\r\nrepeated in innumerable exemplars. One must remember, in order to\r\nappreciate Cuvier's view, that he was not obsessed, as we are, by the\r\nidea of evolution.\r\n\r\nCuvier thought in terms of organs, not in terms of \"materials of\r\norganisation.\" He held that the resemblances between the organs of one\r\nclass of animals and the organs of another were due to the similarity of\r\ntheir functions. \"Let us conclude, then, that if there are resemblances\r\nbetween the organs of fish and those of other classes, it is only in the\r\nmeasure that there is a resemblance between their functions.\"[119] There\r\nare only a few kinds of organs, each adapted for a particular function,\r\nand these organs are necessarily repeated from class to class.--\"As the\r\nanimal kingdom has received only a limited number of organs, it is\r\ninevitable that some at least of these organs should be common to\r\nseveral classes.\"[120]\r\n\r\nGeoffroy thought in terms of \"materials,\" of parts of indefinite\r\nfunction, parts which might take on any function. He insists upon the\r\nnecessity of disregarding function when tracing out the unity of\r\ncomposition. He considers, in direct opposition to Cuvier's\r\ninterpretation of structural resemblance as due to similarity of\r\nfunction, that unity of composition is the primary fact, and similarity\r\nof function subsidiary. In his reply in the _Mammiferes_ (1829) to\r\nCuvier's criticisms in the _Histoire naturelle des Poissons_ (1828), he\r\ninsists on the necessity of excluding function from consideration in any\r\ntruly philosophical treatment of comparative anatomy (Discours prel., p.\r\n25). Cuvier held that function determined structure, or at least that\r\nthe necessity of adaptation ruled the transformations of form. Geoffroy\r\nconsidered that structure determined function, that changes of\r\nstructure, however they might arise, caused changes of function.\r\n\"Animals,\" he writes, \"have no habits but those that result from the\r\nstructure of their organs; if the latter varies, there vary in the same\r\nmanner all their springs of action, all their faculties and all their\r\nactions.\"[121]\r\n\r\nAgain, \"a vegetarian regime is imposed upon the Quadrumana by their\r\npossession of a somewhat ample stomach, and intestines of moderate\r\nlength.\"[122] The hand of the bat has become so modified as to constrain\r\nthe bat to live in the air.[123]\r\n\r\nThe best example of Geoffroy's insistence upon the priority of structure\r\nto function, and so of his purely morphological attitude, is perhaps his\r\ninterpretation, already alluded to, of the appendages of Articulates.\r\nThe segments of the Articulate are, he says, the equivalents of the\r\nbodies of the vertebrae of higher forms. Now \"from the circumstance that\r\nthe vertebra is external, it results that the ribs must be so too; and,\r\nas it is impossible that organs of such a size can remain passive and\r\nabsolutely functionless, these great arms, hanging there continually at\r\nthe disposition of the animal, are pressed into the service of\r\nprogression, and become its efficient instruments.\"[124] The ribs become\r\nlocomotory appendages.\r\n\r\nWe may compare the similar thought that the ear ossicles are simply\r\nopercular bones reduced and turned to other uses.\r\n\r\nGeoffroy could not but recognise the correlation of structure to\r\nfunction, for this is a fact which imposes itself upon every observer.\r\nHe recognised also correlation between functions, as when he pointed out\r\nthe connection between increased respiration and enhanced muscular\r\nactivity in birds.[125] He interpreted structure at times in terms of\r\nfunction, the short, strong clavicle of the mole as an adaptation to\r\ndigging, the keeled sternum of birds as an adaptation to flying, and so\r\non. But we may say that his whole tendency was to disregard function, to\r\nlook upon it as subsidiary. He protests against arguing from function\r\nand habits to structure, as an \"abuse of final causes.\"[126] He was not so\r\nconvinced as Cuvier was of the all-importance of functional correlation;\r\nin this view he was probably confirmed by his work on teratology. It did\r\nnot surprise him that Insects, in which lungs, heart and circulation\r\nhave disappeared(!), should yet have a skeleton built upon the same plan\r\nas the skeleton of Vertebrates, which possess these organs; the\r\ncorrelation of organ-systems is not so close as to prevent this.[127] So\r\ntoo, although the other organs of the insect are all inside the body of\r\nthe vertebrae, they are yet comparable with the organs of Vertebrates.[128]\r\nThe existence of rudimentary organs also seemed to him an argument\r\nagainst too strict a correlation of parts.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the teleological attitude, with its insistence upon\r\nthe priority of function to structure, and the morphological attitude,\r\nwith its conviction of the priority of structure to function, is one of\r\nthe most fundamental in biology.\r\n\r\nCuvier and Geoffroy are the greatest representatives of these opposing\r\nviews. Which of them is right? Is there nothing more in the unity and\r\ndiversity of organic forms than the results of functional adaptation, or\r\nis Geoffroy right in insisting upon an element of unity which cannot be\r\nexplained in terms of adaptation? If there be an irreducible element of\r\nunity, is there any truth in Geoffroy's suggestion that this unity\r\nresults from a power which is exercised in the world of atoms where are\r\nelements of inalterable character?[129]\r\n\r\nThe problem as Geoffroy and Cuvier understood it was not an evolutionary\r\none. But the problem exists unchanged for the evolutionist, and\r\nevolution-theory is essentially an attempt to solve it in the one\r\ndirection or the other. Theories such as Darwin's, which assume a random\r\nvariation which is not primarily a response to environmental changes,\r\nanswer the problem in Geoffroy's sense. Theories such as Lamarck's,\r\nwhich postulate an active responsive self-adaptation of the organism,\r\nare essentially a continuation and completing of Cuvier's thought.\r\n\r\n    [86] \"Memoire sur les rapports naturels des makis,\"\r\n    _Magasin Encyclopedique_, vii.\r\n\r\n    [87] Discours preliminaire, pp. xv.-xxiv.\r\n\r\n    [88] _Etudes progressives d'un Naturaliste_, p. 50,\r\n    Paris, 1835.\r\n\r\n    [89] _Philosophie Anatomique_., i., Introduction, p. 1.\r\n\r\n    [90] \"Sur une colonne vertebrale et ses cotes dans les\r\n    insectes apiropodes,\" (_Acad.

Serres was primarily a\r\nmedical anatomist; his interest lay in human anatomy and embryology,\r\nnormal and pathological.\r\n\r\nHis best early work was an _Anatomie comparee du cerveau_ (1824-26),\r\nwhich met with a flattering reception from Cuvier.[130] He laid great\r\nstress upon the development of the brain and spinal cord in the\r\ndifferent classes, and was quick to point out analogies not only between\r\nadult but also between embryonic structures. He paid much attention to\r\ncases of correlation, and noted a great many; he observed, for instance,\r\na constant relation between the development of the spinal cord and of\r\nthe corpora quadrigemina, and between the size of the corpora\r\nquadrigemina and the volume of the optic nerves and eyes. In this the\r\ninfluence of Cuvier is unmistakable.\r\n\r\nSerres' early theoretical views are to be found in a series of papers in\r\nthe _Annales des Sciences naturelles_,[131] under the general title\r\n_Recherches d'Anatomie transcendante, sur les Lois de l'Organogenie\r\nappliquees a l'anatomie pathologique_, also published separately. We\r\nfollow these papers in our expose of Serres' doctrine, reserving for a\r\nfuture chapter (Chap. XII.) the consideration of his matured views of\r\nthirty years later.\r\n\r\nIn the first of them he points out how neither position nor function has\r\nproved altogether sufficient to establish homologies. In the early days\r\nanatomists were guided by form; when form failed them, they traced an\r\norgan in its changes throughout the series of animals by considering its\r\nfunction. This method was satisfactory enough as regards the organs of\r\nthe nutritive life. But in the organs of the life of relation, in the\r\nnervous system, the functions of the parts were difficult to discover,\r\nand their form very changeful. Hence a new principle was required, and\r\nSerres found it in the thought which he probably owed to the German\r\ntranscendentalists (see Chap. VII.), that the permanent structure of the\r\nlower animals could be compared with phases in the development of the\r\nhigher, and particularly of man, or, as he put it, that comparative\r\nanatomy was often only a fixed and permanent anthropogeny, and\r\nanthropogeny a fugitive and transitory comparative anatomy (xi., p.\r\n106).\r\n\r\n\"In rising towards the first formations,\" he writes, \"transcendental\r\nanatomy recognised that one and the same organ, however complicated its\r\ndefinitive form might be, repeated in its transitory states the organic\r\nsimplicities of the lower classes. Thus the primitive heart of birds was\r\nfirst of all a canal, then a pocket or single cavity, then finally the\r\ncomplex organ of the class. Comparative anatomy was thus seen to be\r\nrepeated and reproduced by embryogeny\" (xii., p. 85).\r\n\r\nHis explanation of the fact of repetition is that, \"in animals belonging\r\nto the lower classes the _formative force_, whatever it may be, has a\r\nless energetic impulsion than in the higher animals, and hence the\r\norgans pass through only a part of the transformations which those of\r\nthe higher forms undergo; and it is for this reason that they show\r\npermanently the organic dispositions which are only transitory in the\r\nembryo of man and the higher Vertebrates. Hence these double aortas,\r\nthese double venae cavae which one observes more or less constantly among\r\nreptiles\" (xxi., p. 48).\r\n\r\nThe number of stages in embryogeny is proportionate to the complexity of\r\nthe adult; the younger the embryo the simpler its organs--such is the\r\ngeneral formula of the relation between the embryo and the adult. But\r\nhere in Serres' doctrine of parallelism a complication enters. He\r\nobserved that embryonic organs did not always develop in a piece, by\r\nsimple growth, but often were formed by the union of separately formed\r\nparts or layers. Thus the kidney in man is formed by the fusion of a\r\nnumber of \"little kidneys,\" and the spinal cord reaches its full\r\ndevelopment by the laying down of successive layers within it. He was\r\ngreatly impressed with this fact, which, as a convinced believer in\r\nepigenesis, he used with great effect against the preformistic theories.\r\n\"This method of isolated formation,\" he wrote, \"is noticed in early\r\nstages in the thyroid, the liver, the heart, the aorta, the intestinal\r\ncanal, the womb, the prostate, the clitoris, and the penis\" (xi., p.\r\n69). So, too, in the development of the skeleton, ossification proceeds\r\nfrom separate centres, foramina are formed by the fusion of separate\r\nbones round them. In his memoir, _Lois d'Osteogenie_ (1819), Serres\r\nestablished several laws of ossification based upon this principle of\r\nseparate formation.[132]\r\n\r\nHow is the fact of multiple formation to be reconciled with the\r\nprinciple of repetition, according to which organs are simplest in the\r\nearly embryo and in the lower animals? But observation shows that, as a\r\nrule, the further down the scale you go the more divided organs\r\nbecome--the more numerous the bones of the skull, for example. There is\r\nthus a parallel between multiple formation of organs in the embryos of\r\nthe higher Vertebrates and their subdivided state in the lower. Take,\r\nfor example, the kidney. In the genus _Felis_, and in birds, each kidney\r\nhas two lobes, in the elephant four, in the otter ten, in the ox twelve\r\nto fourteen. The human kidney in its development starts with about a\r\ndozen lobes, and the number diminishes as the kidney grows. Thus the\r\npermanent state of the kidney in the animals mentioned is reproduced by\r\nthe stages of its development in man (xii., p. 126).\r\n\r\nSo, too, at the second or third month the uterus of the human embryo is\r\nbicornuate, and afterwards passes through stages comparable to the adult\r\nand permanent uterus of rodents, ruminants, and carnivores. There is\r\nindeed a time in the development of the human embryo when it resembles\r\nin many of its organs the adult stage of various lower animals. It is\r\nabout this time that it possesses a tail.\r\n\r\nWe note that Serres' theory of parallelism applies, strictly speaking,\r\nonly to organs, not to organisms, although he, too, readily fell into\r\nthe error of supposing that the organisation of an embryo could be\r\ncompared as a whole with the adult organisation of an animal lower in\r\nthe scale. Thus he wrote in one of his later papers[133]--\"As our\r\nresearches have made clear, an animal high in the organic scale only\r\nreaches this rank by passing through all the intermediate states which\r\nseparate it from the animals placed below it. Man only becomes man after\r\ntraversing transitional organisatory states which assimilate him first\r\nto fish, then to reptiles, then to birds and mammals.\" Serres was not\r\naltogether free from the besetting sin of the transcendentalists--hasty\r\ngeneralisation.\r\n\r\nThe law of parallelism applied not only to Vertebrates but also to\r\nInvertebrates. In a short paper[134] of 1824 Serres attempted an\r\nexplanation of the nervous system of Invertebrates. Invertebrates, he\r\nconsidered, lacked the cerebrospinal axis of Vertebrates, and their\r\nnervous system was the homologue of the sympathetic system of\r\nVertebrates. The relation of the invertebrate to the vertebrate nervous\r\nsystem being thus fixed, can the nervous system of Invertebrates be\r\nreduced to one plan? It does not seem possible to establish a common\r\nplan for the adult nervous systems. But apply the principle of\r\nparallelism, which has proved so valuable within the limits of the\r\nvertebrate series. Taking insects as the highest class, we find that\r\nthere are three stages in the development of their nervous system; in\r\nthe first the nervous system is composed of two separate strands, in the\r\nsecond the strands unite round the oesophagus, in the third they unite\r\nalso behind. Now in _Bulla aperta_, stage (1) is permanent; in _Clio_,\r\n_Doris_, _Aplysia_, _Tritonia_, _Sepia_, _Helix_, stage (2) is\r\npermanent, and in _Unio_ stage (3). In fact, all the varieties of the\r\nnervous system of molluscs fall into one or other of these three\r\nclasses. \"It follows, then, that as regards their nervous system, the\r\nMollusca are more or less advanced larvae of insects\" (p. 380). The law\r\nof parallelism is here applied to single organ-systems, but in later\r\nyears Serres applied it to whole organisations also, saying that the\r\nlower Invertebrates were permanent embryos of the higher.\r\n\r\nIn the paper of 1834, already referred to, Serres pushed his\r\nspeculations further and attempted to establish the unity of type of all\r\nanimals, Vertebrates and Invertebrates alike--a favourite pastime of the\r\ntranscendentalists. It is incontestable, he admits, that adult\r\nInvertebrates are quite different in structure from adult Vertebrates,\r\n\"but if one regards them as what I take them to be, namely, _permanent\r\nembryos_, and if one compares their organisation with the embryogeny of\r\nVertebrates, one sees the differences disappear, and from their\r\nanalogies arise a crowd of unsuspected resemblances\" (_loc. cit._, p.\r\n247).\r\n\r\nThe last point of Serres' doctrine which calls for remark is his\r\ninterpretation of abnormalities as being often comparable to grades of\r\nstructure permanent in the lower animals. Thus the double aorta which\r\nmay occur as an abnormality in man is the normal and permanent state in\r\nreptiles. This idea, of course, he got from Etienne Geoffroy St Hilaire.\r\nIt is further developed in his \"_Theorie des formations et des\r\ndeformations organiques appliquee a l'anatomie comparee des\r\nmonstruosites_ (1832), and in his final large memoir of 1860 (see below,\r\np. 205).\r\n\r\nIn 1816 appeared a fine piece of work by J. C. Savigny on the homologies\r\nof the appendages in Articulates. The standpoint was that of pure\r\nmorphology. \"I am convinced,\" he wrote, \"that when a more complete\r\nexamination has been made of the mouth of insects, properly so called,\r\nthat is to say, having six legs and two antennae, it will be found that\r\nwhatever form it affects it is always essentially composed of the same\r\nelements.... The organ remains the same, only the function is modified\r\nor changed--such is Nature's constant plan.\"[135] In this the influence of\r\nGeoffroy can be traced; but the work was very free from the\r\nexaggerations of the transcendentalists, and many of Savigny's\r\nhomologies are accepted even to-day. The first memoir dealt with the\r\nmouth-parts of insects; the second with the anterior appendages of\r\nArticulates generally. Savigny shows that the mouth-parts of insects can\r\nbe reduced to the type shown in Orthoptera, where there are clearly two\r\nmandibles, two maxillae, and a lower lip formed by the fusion of two\r\nsecond maxillae. All other insects have these same mouth-parts, disposed\r\nin the same order, however much their form may have been modified in\r\nresponse to new functions. He goes on to compare the anterior set of\r\nappendages in a long series of Articulates, in _Julus_, _Scolopendra_,\r\n_Cancer_, _Gammarus_, _Cyamus_, _Nymphon_, _Phalangium_, _Apus_,\r\n_Caligus_, _Limulus_, and a few others. For Crustacea he established the\r\nhomologies now accepted, of the mandibles with the mandibles of insects,\r\nof the first and second pairs of maxillae with the parts so named in\r\ninsects, and so on. He is quite clear that the maxillipedes of Crustacea\r\nare the homologues of the feet of Hexapoda. \"Their disposition must lead\r\none to think that the six anterior feet of _Julus_, that is to say, all\r\nthe feet of the Hexapoda, are here transformed into jaws\" (_loc. cit._,\r\np. 48). In _Scolopendra_ also there is a similar transformation of two\r\npairs of legs into auxiliary jaws. In _Gammarus_, where there is only\r\nthe first pair of maxillipedes, the other two pairs have become\r\n\"retransformed\" into feet. We find him supporting his comparison of the\r\nthree anterior pairs of legs in _Julus_ to the three pairs of legs in\r\ninsects by an argument drawn from embryology; for only the first three\r\npairs of feet are present in _Julus_ at birth (Degeer), \"an observation,\r\nwhich, together with their position, should cause them to be considered\r\nas the representatives of the six thoracic feet of Hexapoda\" (p. 44).\r\n\r\nHis comparison of the Arachnid appendages with those of insects and\r\nCrustacea is very curious. As his starting-point he takes _Cyamus_,\r\nwhich has antennae (two pairs) and mouth parts (four pairs) as in many\r\nCrustacea, and then seven pairs of legs; he compares with it _Nymphon_,\r\nwhich has in all seven pairs of appendages. These appendages he\r\nhomologises with the seven pairs of legs of _Cyamus_, so that the first\r\nappendage in _Nymphon_ corresponds to the seventh appendage of _Cyamus_.\r\nThis homology is extended to all Arachnids; their first two pairs of\r\nappendages, however they may be modified as \"false\" mandibles and\r\n\"false\" maxillae, really correspond to the second and third maxillipedes\r\nin Crustacea, and to the second and third pairs of feet in insects. It\r\nis interesting to note that he treats _Limulus_ as an Arachnid, pointing\r\nout that there is as much difference between _Apus_ and _Limulus_ as\r\nbetween _Cancer_ and _Phalangium_. He describes the \"gnathobases\" in\r\n_Phalangium_ and _Limulus_. We may note that he had just an inkling of\r\nthe modern doctrine that all the appendages of Articulates consist of a\r\nbasal joint bearing an inner and an outer terminal piece, for he\r\nobserves that the \"cirri\" of the maxillipedes of Crustacea give the\r\nappendage the same bifid appearance as the appendages of the abdomen and\r\nthe thoracic legs of _Mysis_ (p. 50).\r\n\r\nV. Audouin, in his memoir, _Recherches anatomiques sur le thorax des\r\nanimaux articules_,[135] applied the principle of the unity of plan and\r\ncomposition to the exoskeleton of insects, Crustaceans, and Arachnids.\r\nHis guiding ideas were, \"(1) that the skeleton of articulated animals is\r\nformed of a definite number of pieces, which are either distinct or\r\nintimately fused with one another; (2) that in many cases, some pieces\r\ndiminish or altogether disappear, while others reach an excessive\r\ndevelopment; (3) that the increase of one piece seems to exert on the\r\nneighbouring pieces a kind of influence which explains all the\r\ndifferences one finds between the individuals of each order, family and\r\ngenus\" (Sep. copy, p. 16). Geoffroy had already stated, without proof,\r\nthat the parts of the Arthropod's skeleton, however they might change in\r\nshape and size, remained faithful to the principle of connections, at\r\nleast at their points of insertion.[137] Audouin gave the detailed\r\ndemonstration of this by his accurate and minute determination of the\r\npieces of the arthropod skeleton. He recognised that the body of\r\nArthropods was made up of a series of similar rings, and that even the\r\ncompact head of insects consisted of fused segments. In each segment\r\nAudouin distinguished a fixed number of hard chitinous parts, the dorsal\r\ntergum, the ventral sternum, the lateral \"flanc\" of three pieces, all to\r\nbe recognised by their positions relative to one another. Many of the\r\nnames which he proposed are still in use; it was he who introduced the\r\nterms prothorax, mesothorax, and metathorax, for the three segments of\r\nthe insect's thorax. He used Geoffroy's _Loi de balancement_ to explain\r\ncases of correlative development, such as the relation between the size\r\nof the front wings and the development of the mesothorax. In another\r\npaper Audouin compared the three pieces of the dorsal skeleton of\r\nTrilobites to the tergum and the upper part of the \"flanc.\"[138] In a\r\nthird paper of about the same time he tried to establish the homologies\r\nof the segments throughout the Articulate series--with less success than\r\nSavigny.\r\n\r\nLater on, in conjunction with Milne-Edwards, he demonstrated the unity\r\nof composition of the nervous system in Crustacea, showing how the\r\nconcentrated system of the crab was formed by the same series of ganglia\r\nas in the Macrura.\r\n\r\nThe entomologist Latreille also tackled the problem of the homologies of\r\nthe segments in the different classes of Arthropods (Cuvier, _loc.\r\ncit._, p. cclxxii.). He thought he could find fifteen segments in all\r\nArthropods. He made the retrograde step of likening the head of insects\r\nto a single segment. But some of his homologies showed morphological\r\ninsight, _e.g._, his comparison of the \"first jaws\" of Arachnids to\r\nantennae, because they were placed above the upper lip. It was he who\r\nfirst pointed out the resemblance of the leaf-like gills of Ephemerid\r\nlarvae to wings, and suggested that wings were \"a sort of tracheal feet.\"\r\n\r\nHe made also a rather hazy and speculative contribution on Okenian lines\r\nto the problem of the relation of Arthropods to Vertebrates, likening\r\nthe carapace of Crustacea to an enormously developed hyoid, the\r\nappendages of the tail to the ventral and anal fins of fish. The\r\nmasticatory organs of Arthropods were jaws disjointed at their\r\nsymphysis; antennae, nostrils turned outside in.\r\n\r\nDuges also made a comparison of Articulates with Vertebrates.[139] He did\r\nnot accept Geoffroy's vertebral theory of the Arthropod skeleton, though\r\nhe admitted that in Arthropods the dorsal surface was turned towards the\r\nground, basing this assumption on the position of the nervous system,\r\nand also, curiously enough, on the inverted position of the embryo on\r\nthe lower surface of the yolk. He considered that the mandibles and\r\nfirst maxillae of Arthropods were the homologues of the upper and lower\r\njaws of Vertebrates, adducing as confirmatory evidence the fact that in\r\nsnakes the rami are separate. The labium was the equivalent of the\r\nhyoid, the labial palps and maxillipedes the equivalent of the \"hyoid\"\r\nelements which form the branchial arches.\r\n\r\nBut Duges' main contribution to morphological method was his conception\r\nof the living organism as a colony of lesser units, which were\r\nthemselves real \"organisms.\" \"By _organism_ the author means a complex\r\nof organs which taken together suffice to constitute, ideally or\r\nactually, a complete animal. An 'organism' is, as it were, an elementary\r\nor simple animal; several organisms combined form a complex animal\" (p.\r\n255). Duges hit upon this principle, which was first suggested to him by\r\nA. Moquin-Tandon's work on the leech (1827), as a great aid in\r\ndemonstrating the unity of plan and composition throughout the animal\r\nkingdom.[140] According to his view there are three main types of\r\nanimals--(1) Biserials, including bilaterally symmetrical animals,\r\ncomposed of two parallel series of \"organisms\"; (2) Radiates, composed\r\nof \"organisms\" arranged like the spokes of a wheel; and (3)\r\nRaceme-animals, in which the separate \"organisms\" were disposed more or\r\nless irregularly, in bunches (p. 257). The unitary \"organism\" is\r\nsupposed to be the same in all, only the arrangement differing. Duges of\r\ncourse admitted that the centralisation of the complete organism became\r\ngreater the higher it stood in the scale, and that this held good also\r\nin individual development. The appendages of Articulates and Vertebrates\r\nwere thought of as the members of as many separate organisms. He went so\r\nfar as to suggest that the fingers of a man's hand were the free\r\nextremities of as many thoracic members.\r\n\r\nDuges' conception of the organism has often been revived since in a\r\nsaner form, _e.g._, by E. Perrier, and it has a certain validity. It has\r\nmuch affinity with the similar conceptions of Goethe and the German\r\ntranscendentalists.\r\n\r\n    [130] _Mem. Acad.

We have already seen many of these notions\r\nforeshadowed by Goethe, who had considerable affinity with the\r\ntranscendentalists, but the full development of transcendental habits of\r\nthought comes a little later than the bulk of Goethe's scientific work,\r\nand owes more to Kielmeyer and Oken than to Goethe himself.\r\n\r\nA great wave of transcendentalism seems to have passed over biological\r\nthought in the early 19th century, arising mainly in Germany, but\r\npowerfully affecting, as we have seen, the thought of Geoffroy and his\r\nfollowers. Many ideas were common to the French and German schools of\r\ntranscendental anatomy, the fundamental conception that there exists a\r\nunique plan of structure, the idea of the scale of beings, the notion of\r\nthe parallelism between the development of the individual and the\r\nevolution of the race. It is difficult to disentangle the part played by\r\neach school and to determine which should have the credit for particular\r\ntheories and discoveries. The philosophy seems to have come chiefly from\r\nGermany, the science from France. It must be borne in mind that German\r\ncomparative anatomy was largely derivative from French, that the Paris\r\nMuseum was the acknowledged anatomical centre, and that Cuvier was its\r\nacknowledged head.\r\n\r\nIt is probably correct to say that the credit mainly belongs to the\r\nGerman transcendental school for the law of the parallelism between the\r\nstages of individual development and the stages of the scale of beings,\r\nand the theory of the repetition or multiplication of parts within the\r\nindividual. The vertebral theory of the skull is a particular\r\napplication of the second of these generalisations.\r\n\r\nThe law of parallelism[141] seems to have been expressed first by\r\nKielmeyer (1793),[142] who gave to it a physiological form, saying that\r\nthe human embryo shows at first a purely vegetative life, then becomes\r\nlike the lower animals, which move but have no sensation, and finally\r\nreaches the level of the animals that both feel and move.\r\n\r\nThe idea was next taught by Autenrieth in 1797.[143]\r\n\r\nOken (1779-1851) in his early tract _Die Zeugung_ (1805), and in his\r\n_Lehrbuch der Naturphilosophie_ (1809-11) elaborated the thought, and\r\ntaught that every animal in its development passes through the classes\r\nimmediately below it. \"During its development the animal passes through\r\nall stages of the animal kingdom. The foetus is a representation of all\r\nanimal classes in time.\"[144] The Insect, for example, is at first Worm,\r\nnext Crab, then a perfect volant animal with limbs, a Fly (_ibid._, p.\r\n542).\r\n\r\nAs Nature is \"the representation of the individual activities of the\r\nspirit,\" so the animal kingdom is the representation of the activities\r\nor organs of man. The animal kingdom is therefore \"a dismemberment of\r\nthe highest animal, _i.e._, of Man\" (p. 494). Now \"animals are gradually\r\nperfected, entirely like the single animal body, by adding organ unto\r\norgan\"--the way of evolution is the way of development. Hence \"animals\r\nare only the persistent foetal stages or conditions of Man,\" who is the\r\nmicrocosm, and contains within himself all the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nOken was himself a careful student of embryology; von Baer[145] speaks of\r\nhis work (published in Oken and Kieser, _Beitraege zur vergleichenden\r\nZoologie, Anatomie und Physiologie_, 2 pts., 1806-7) as forming the\r\nturning-point in our understanding of the mammalian ovum. He had\r\naccordingly actually observed a resemblance in certain details of\r\nstructure between the human foetus and the lower animals; but the\r\npeculiar form which the law took in his hands was a consequence of his\r\nhazy philosophy. He saw the relation of teratological to foetal\r\nstructure, for he affirmed that \"malformations are only persistent\r\nfoetal conditions\" (p. 492).\r\n\r\nThe idea of comparing the embryo of higher animals with the adult of\r\nlower was widely spread at this time among German zoologists. We find,\r\nfor example, in Tiedemann's brilliant little textbook[146] the statement\r\nthat \"Every animal, before reaching its full development, passes through\r\nthe stage of organisation of one or more classes lower in the scale, or,\r\nevery animal begins its metamorphosis with the simplest organisation\"\r\n(p. 57).\r\n\r\nThus the higher animals begin life as a kind of fluid animal jelly which\r\nresembles the substance of a polyp; the young mammal, like the lower\r\nVertebrates, has only a simple circulation, and, like them, lives in\r\nwater (the amniotic fluid); the frog is first like a worm, then develops\r\ngills and becomes like a fish (p. 57). In his work on the anatomy of the\r\nbrain,[147] Tiedemann established the homology of the optic lobes in birds\r\nby comparing them with foetal corpora quadrigemina in man (see Serres,\r\n_Ann. Sci. nat._, xii., p. 112).\r\n\r\nJ. F. Meckel, in 1811, devoted a long essay to a detailed proof of the\r\nparallelism between the embryonic states of the higher animals and the\r\npermanent states of the lower animals. In a previous memoir in the same\r\ncollection[148] (i., 1, 1808) he had made some comparisons of this kind in\r\ndealing with the development of the human foetus; in this memoir (ii.,\r\n1, 1811) he brings together all the facts which seem to prove the\r\nparallelism.\r\n\r\nHis collection of facts is a very heterogeneous one; he mingles\r\nmorphological with physiological analogies, and makes the most\r\nfar-fetched comparisons between organs belonging to animals of the most\r\ndiverse groups. He compares, for instance, the placenta with the gills\r\nof fish, of molluscs and of worms, homologising the cotyledons with the\r\nseparate tufts of gills in _Tethys, Scyllaea_ and _Arenicola_(p. 26).\r\nThis is purely a physiological analogy. He compares the closed anus of\r\nthe early human embryo with the permanent absence of an anus in\r\nCoelentera, and the embryo's lack of teeth with the absence of teeth in\r\nmany reptiles and fish, in birds, and in many Cetacea (p. 46).[149] These\r\nare merely chance resemblances of no morphological importance. He\r\nconsiders bladderworms as animals which have never escaped from their\r\namnion, and _Volvox_ as not having developed beyond the level of an egg\r\n(p. 7). He lays much stress upon likeness of shape and of relative size,\r\ncomparing, for instance, the large multilobate liver of the human foetus\r\nwith the many-lobed liver of lower Vertebrates and of Invertebrates. In\r\ngeneral he shows himself, in his comparisons, lacking in morphological\r\ninsight.\r\n\r\nHis treatment of the vascular system affords perhaps the best example of\r\nhis method (pp. 8-25). The simplest form of heart is the simple tubular\r\norgan in insects, and it is under this form that the heart first appears\r\nin the developing chick. The bent form of the embryonic heart recalls\r\nthe heart of spiders; it lies at first free, as in the mollusc _Anomia_.\r\nThe heart consists at first of one chamber only, recalling the\r\none-chambered heart of Crustacea. A little later three chambers are\r\ndeveloped, the auricle, ventricle, and aortic bulb; at this stage there\r\nis a resemblance to the heart of fish and amphibia. At the end of the\r\nfourth day the auricle becomes divided into two, affording a parallel\r\nwith the adult heart of many reptiles.\r\n\r\nIn his large text-book of a somewhat later date, the _System der\r\nvergleichenden Anatomie_ (i., 1821), he works out the idea again and\r\ngives to it a much wider theoretic sweep, hinting that the development\r\nof the individual is a repetition of the evolutionary history of the\r\nrace. Meckel was a timid believer in evolution. He thought it quite\r\npossible that much of the variety of animal form was due to a process of\r\nevolution caused by forces inherent in the organism. \"The\r\ntransformations,\" he writes, \"which have determined the most remarkable\r\nchanges in the number and development of the instruments of organisation\r\nare incontestably much more the consequence of the tendency, inherent in\r\norganic matter, which leads it insensibly to rise to higher states of\r\norganisation, passing through a series of intermediate states.\"[150]\r\n\r\nHis final enunciation of the law of parallelism in this same volume\r\nshows that he considered the development of the individual to be due to\r\nthe same forces that rule evolution. \"The development of the individual\r\norganism obeys the same laws as the development of the whole animal\r\nseries; that is to say, the higher animal, in its gradual evolution,\r\nessentially passes through the permanent organic stages which lie below\r\nit; a circumstance which allows us to assume a close analogy between the\r\ndifferences which exist between the diverse stages of development, and\r\nbetween each of the animal classes\" (p. 514).\r\n\r\nHe was not, of course, able fully to prove his contention that the lower\r\nanimals are the embryos of the higher, and we gather from the following\r\npassage that he could maintain it only in a somewhat modified form. \"It\r\nis certain,\" he writes, \"that if a given organ shows in the embryo of a\r\nhigher animal a given form, identical with that shown throughout life by\r\nan animal belonging to a lower class, the embryo, in respect of this\r\nportion of its economy, belongs to the class in question\" (p. 535). The\r\nembryo of a Vertebrate might at a certain stage of development, be\r\ncalled a mollusc, if for instance, it had the heart of a mollusc.\r\n\r\nHe admits, too, that the highest animal of all does not pass through in\r\nhis development the entire animal series. But the embryo of man always\r\nand necessarily passes through many animal stages, at least as regards\r\nits single organs and organ-systems, and this is enough in Meckel's eyes\r\nto justify the law of parallelism (p. 535).\r\n\r\nIn his excellent discussion of teratology Meckel points out how the idea\r\nof parallelism throws light upon certain abnormalities which are found\r\nto be normal in other (lower) forms (p. 556).[151]\r\n\r\nWe may refer to one other statement of the law of parallelism--by K. G.\r\nCarus in his _Lehrbuch der vergleichenden Anatomie_ (Leipzig, 1834). The\r\nstandpoint is again that of _Naturphilosophie_. It is a general law of\r\nNature, Carus thinks, that the higher formations include the lower; thus\r\nthe animal includes the vegetable, for it possesses the \"vegetative\" as\r\nwell as the \"animal\" organs. So it is, too, by a rational necessity that\r\nthe development of a perfect animal repeats the series of antecedent\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, the main credit for the enunciation of the law of\r\nparallelism belongs to the German transcendental school; but the law\r\nowes much also to Serres, who, with Meckel, worked out its implications.\r\nIt might for convenience, and in order to distinguish it from the laws\r\nlater enunciated by von Baer and Haeckel, be called the law of\r\nMeckel-Serres.\r\n\r\nUnder the \"theory of the repetition or multiplication of parts within\r\nthe organism\" may be included, first, generalisations on the serial\r\nhomology of parts, and second, more or less confused attempts to\r\ndemonstrate that the whole organisation is repeated in certain of the\r\nparts. The recognition of serial homologies constituted a real advance\r\nin morphology; the \"philosophical\" idea of the repetition of the whole\r\nin the parts led to many absurdities. It led Oken to assert that in the\r\nhead the whole trunk is repeated, that the upper jaw corresponds to the\r\narms, the lower to the legs, that in each jaw the same bony divisions\r\nexist as in the limbs, the teeth, for instance, corresponding to the\r\nclaws (_loc. cit._, p. 408). It led him to distinguish \"two animals\" in\r\nevery body--the cephalic and the sexual animal. Each of these has its\r\nown organs; thus \"in the perfect animal there are two intestinal systems\r\nthoroughly distinct from each other, two intestines which belong to two\r\ndifferent animals, the sexual and cephalic animal, or the plant and the\r\nanimal\" (p. 382). The intestine of the sexual animal is the large\r\nintestine; the lungs of the sexual animal are the kidneys, its glottis\r\nis the urethra, its mouth the anus. So, too, the mouth is the stomach of\r\nthe head. On another line of thought the sternum is a ventral vertebral\r\ncolumn. Limbs are connate ribs, the digits indicating the number of ribs\r\nincluded (_cf._ Duges, _supra_, p. 88).\r\n\r\nJ. F. Meckel[152] discusses \"homologies\" of this kind in the thorough and\r\npedestrian way so characteristic of him. Not only, he says, are the\r\nright and left halves of the body comparable with one another, but also\r\nthe upper and the lower, the dividing line being drawn at the level of\r\nthe diaphragm. The lumbar complex corresponds to the skull, the anus to\r\nthe mouth, the urino-genital opening to the nasal opening; in general,\r\nthe urino-genital system corresponds to the respiratory, the kidneys to\r\nthe lungs, the ureters to bronchi, the testes and ovaries to the thymus\r\n(he had observed the physiological relation between the development of\r\nthe thymus and the state of the genital organs), the prostate and the\r\nuterus to the thyroid gland, and the penis and clitoris to the tongue.\r\nThe fore-limbs and girdle correspond in detail with the hind limbs and\r\nthe pelvis--a point already worked out by Vicq d'Azyr; the dorsal and\r\nventral halves of the body are likewise comparable in some respects, the\r\nsternum, for example, answering in the arrangement of its bones, muscles\r\nand arteries to the vertebral column. The skeleton of each member is in\r\nsome respects a repetition of the vertebral column.\r\n\r\nHis brother, D. A. Meckel,[153] worked out an elaborate comparison between\r\nthe alimentary canal and the genital organs, basing the legitimacy of\r\nthe comparison upon early embryological relations and upon the state of\r\nthings in Coelentera, where genital and digestive organs occupy the same\r\ncavity. In his view the uterus corresponded to the stomach, the vagina\r\nto the oesophagus, the fallopian tubes to the intestine, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe vertebral theory of the skull took its origin from the same habit of\r\nthought. As part of the wider idea of the metameric repetition of parts\r\nit had some scientific worth, but the theory was pushed too far, and the\r\nfacts were twisted to suit it. Among annulate animals the theory of\r\nrepetition found ample scope; Oken was able to compare with justice the\r\njaws of crabs and insects with their other limbs, as Savigny did later\r\nin a more scientific way. Among Vertebrates the application of the\r\ntheory of serial repetition was not so obvious, except in the case of\r\nthe vertebrae. Goethe seems to have been the first to hit upon the idea\r\nthat the skull is composed of a number of vertebrae, serially homologous\r\nwith those of the vertebral column. He tells us that the idea flashed\r\ninto his mind when contemplating in the Jewish cemetery at Venice a\r\ndried sheep's skull. The discovery was made in 1790, but not published\r\ntill 1820.[154]\r\n\r\nThe idea seems to have been taught by Kielmeyer, one of the earliest of\r\nthe \"philosophers of nature,\" but it was not published by him.\r\n\r\nIn a book (_Cours d'Etudes medicales_), published in 1803, Burdin\r\nassimilated the skull to the vertebral column.\r\n\r\nOken, in an inaugural dissertation (Programm) _Ueber die Bedeutung der\r\nSchaedelknochen_,[155] published in 1807, gave to the theory its necessary\r\ndevelopment. Autenrieth, also in 1807,[156] distinguishing separate\r\nganglia in the brain, was not far from the hypothesis that each of these\r\nganglia must have its separate vertebra.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 Dumeril read a paper to the Academie des Sciences in which he\r\ncompared the skull to a gigantic vertebra, basing his hypothesis on the\r\nsimilarity existing between the crests and depressions on the hinder\r\npart of the skull and those on the posterior surfaces of the vertebrae.\r\n\r\nAfter Oken's work the vertebral theory was taken up generally by both\r\nthe German and the French anatomists. Spix published in 1815 a large\r\nvolume on the skull, entitled _Cephalogenesis_, distinguishing (as Oken\r\ndid at first) three cranial vertebrae. Bojanus in his _Anatome testudinis\r\neuropaeae_ (1819), and in a series of papers in _Isis_ (1817-1819, and\r\n1821) established the existence of a fourth cranial vertebra, and this\r\nwas accepted by Oken in the later editions of his _Lehrbuch_. Meckel and\r\nCarus among the Germans, de Blainville and E. Geoffroy among the French,\r\ncontributed to the development of the theory. In England the theory was\r\nchampioned particularly by Richard Owen.\r\n\r\nIt was one thing to assert in a moment of inspiration that the skull was\r\ncomposed of modified vertebrae; it was quite another to demonstrate the\r\nrelation of the separate bones of the skull to the supposed vertebrae.\r\nUpon this much uncertainty reigned; there was not even unanimity as to\r\nthe number of vertebrae to be distinguished. Goethe found six vertebrae in\r\nthe skull; Spix, and at first Oken, three only, Geoffroy seven; the\r\naccepted orthodox number seems to have been four (Bojanus, Oken, Owen).\r\n\r\nAs an example of the method of treatment adopted we may take Oken's\r\nmatured account of the composition of the cranial vertebrae, as given in\r\nthe English translation of his _Lehrbuch_. \"To a perfect vertebra,\" he\r\nsays, \"belong at least five pieces, namely, the body, in front the two\r\nribs, behind the two arches or spinous processes\" (p. 370). In the\r\ncervical vertebrae the transverse processes represent the ribs. The skull\r\nconsists of four vertebrae, the occipital, the parietal, the frontal and\r\nthe nasal, or, named after the sense with which each is associated, the\r\nauditory, the lingual, the ocular and the olfactory. The \"bodies\" of\r\nthese vertebrae are the body of the occipital (basioccipital), the two\r\nbodies of the sphenoid (basi- and pre-sphenoid), and the vomer. The\r\ntransverse processes of each are the condyles of the occipitals\r\n(exoccipitals), the alae of the two sphenoids (alisphenoids and\r\norbitosphenoids) and the lateral surfaces of the vomer. The arches or\r\nspinous processes are the occipital crest, the parietals, the frontals,\r\nand the nasals.\r\n\r\nThe cranium is thus composed of four rings of bone, each composed of the\r\ntypical elements of a vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe arbitrary nature of the comparison is obvious enough. As Cuvier\r\npointed out in the posthumous edition of his _Lecons_, it is only the\r\noccipital segment that shows any real analogy with a vertebra--an\r\nanalogy which Cuvier ascribed to similarity of function. He admitted a\r\nfaint resemblance of the parietal segment to a vertebra:--\"The body of\r\nthe sphenoid does indeed look like a repetition of the basioccipital,\r\nbut having a different function it takes on another form, especially\r\nabove, by reason of its posterior clinoid apophyses.\"[157] He denied the\r\nresemblance of the frontal and nasal \"vertebrae\" to true vertebrae,\r\npointing out that both parietals and frontals are bones specially\r\ndeveloped for the purpose of roofing over and protecting the cerebrum.\r\n\r\nA very curious development was given to the vertebral theory by K. G.\r\nCarus, who seems to have taken as his text a saying of Oken's, that the\r\nwhole skeleton is only a repeated vertebra.[158] His system is worthy of\r\nsome consideration, for he tries to work out a geometry of the\r\nskeleton.[160]\r\n\r\nHis method of deduction is a good example of pure _Naturphilosophie_.\r\nLife, he says, is the development of something determinate from\r\nsomething indeterminate. A finite indeterminate thing, that is, a\r\nliquid, must take a spherical form if it is to exist as an individual.\r\nHence the sphere is the prototype of every organic body. Development\r\ntakes place by antagonism, by polarity, typically by the division and\r\nmultiplication of the sphere. In the course of development the sphere\r\nmay change, by expansion into an egg-shaped body, or by contraction into\r\na crystalline form, the changes due to expansion being typical of living\r\nthings, those due to contraction being typical of dead. At the surface\r\nof the primitive living sphere is developed the protective\r\n_dermatoskeleton_, which naturally takes the shape of a hollow sphere;\r\nround the digestive cavity which is formed in the living sphere is\r\ndeveloped the _splanchnoskeleton_; round the nervous system (which is,\r\nas it were, the animal within the animal) is developed the\r\n_neuroskeleton_. All skeletal formations belong to one or other of these\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nCarus defines his aim to be the discovery of the inner law which\r\npresides over the formation of the skeleton throughout the animal\r\nkingdom; he desires to know \"how such and such a formation is realised\r\nin virtue of the eternal laws of reason\" (iii., p. 93). Here we touch\r\nthe kernel of _Naturphilosophie_--the search for rational laws which are\r\nactive in Nature; the discontent with merely empirical laws.\r\n\r\nThe thesis which Carus sustains is that all forms of skeleton, whether\r\nof dermatoskeleton, splanchnoskeleton, or neuroskeleton, can be deduced\r\nfrom the hollow sphere, which is the primary form of any skeleton\r\nwhatsoever (p. 95). That means, put empirically, that every skeleton can\r\nbe represented schematically by a number of hollow spheres, suitably\r\nmodified in shape, and suitably arranged. The chief modification in\r\nshape exhibited by bones is one which is intermediate between the\r\norganic and the crystalline series of modifications of the sphere. The\r\norganic modifications are bounded by curved lines, the crystalline by\r\nstraight; the intermediate partly by curved and partly by straight\r\nlines. They are the dicone (the shape of a diabolo) and the cylinder.\r\nThese forms must necessarily be of importance for the skeleton, which is\r\nintermediate between the organic and the inorganic. \"The dicone embodies\r\nthe real significance of the bone,\" writes Carus. Each dicone and\r\ncylinder composing the skeleton is called by Carus a vertebra.\r\n\r\nWe may expect then all skeletons to be composed of spheres, cylinders\r\nand dicones in diverse arrangements. Nature being infinite, all the\r\npossible types of arrangement of these elements must exist in the test\r\nor skeleton of some animal, living, fossil, or to come (p. 127). One\r\nconceives easily what the main types of skeleton must be. In some\r\nanimals, _e.g._, sea-urchins, the skeleton is a simple sphere; in\r\nothers, _e.g._, starfish, secondary rows of spheres radiate out from a\r\ncentral sphere or ring; in annulate animals the skeleton consists of a\r\nrow of partially fused spheres.\r\n\r\nIn Vertebrates the arrangement is more complex. There are first the\r\nprotovertebral rings of the dermatoskeleton, these being principally the\r\nribs, limb-girdles, and jaws. Round the central nervous system are\r\ndeveloped the deutovertebral rings of the neuroskeleton (vertebrae in the\r\nordinary sense). The apophyses and bodies of the vertebrae, and the bones\r\nof the members[160] are composed of columns of tritovertebrae, or vertebrae\r\nof the third order. Thus the whole vertebrate skeleton is a particular\r\narrangement of vertebrae, which in their turn are modifications of the\r\nprimary hollow sphere.\r\n\r\nThe German transcendentalists were more or less contemporary with E.\r\nGeoffroy, and no doubt influenced him, especially in his later years, as\r\nthey certainly did his follower Serres. Oken indeed wrote, in a note[161]\r\nappended to Geoffroy's paper on the vertebral column of insects, that\r\n\"Mr Geoffroy [_sic_] is without a doubt the first to introduce in France\r\n_Naturphilosophie_ into comparative anatomy, that is to say, that\r\nphilosophy one of whose doctrines it is to seek after the\r\n_signification_ of organs in the scale of organised beings.\" This is,\r\nhowever, an exaggeration, for Geoffroy was primarily a morphologist,\r\nwhereas the morphology of the German transcendentalists was only a\r\nside-issue of their _Naturphilosophie_.\r\n\r\nGeoffroy, on his part, exercised some influence on the\r\ntranscendentalists. He asserts[162] indeed that Spix got some of the ideas\r\npublished in the _Cephalogenesis_ (1815) from attending his course of\r\nlectures in 1809. It is certainly the case that Spix published before\r\nGeoffroy the view that the opercular bones are homologous with the\r\near-ossicles, adopting, however, a different homology for the separate\r\nbones.[163]\r\n\r\nSome speculations seem to have been common to both schools--for\r\ninstance, the law of Meckel-Serres, the vertebral theory of the skull,\r\nand the recognition of serial homology in the appendages of Arthropods\r\n(Savigny, Oken). Latreille and Duges, as well as Serres, clearly show in\r\ntheir theoretical views the influence of Oken and the other\r\ntranscendentalists. Geoffroy's principle of connections and law of\r\ncompensation were recognised by some at least of the Germans.\r\n\r\nBut whatever his actual historical relations may have been with the\r\nGerman school, Geoffroy was vastly their superior in the matter of pure\r\nmorphology. He alone brought to clear consciousness the principles on\r\nwhich a pure morphology could be based: the Germans were transcendental\r\nphilosophers first, and morphologists after.\r\n\r\nOne understands from this how J. F. Meckel, who was in some ways the\r\nleading comparative anatomist in Germany at this time, could be at once\r\na transcendentalist and an opponent of Geoffroy. Meckel had a curiously\r\neclectic mind. A disciple of Cuvier, having studied in 1804-6 the rich\r\ncollections at the Museum in Paris, the translator of Cuvier's _Lecons\r\nd'anatomie comparee_, he earned for himself the title of the \"German\r\nCuvier,\" partly through the publication of his comprehensive textbook\r\n(_System der vergl. Anatomie_, 5 vols.), partly by his extensive and\r\nmany-sided research work, partly by his authoritative teaching. His\r\n_System_ shows in almost every page of its theoretical part the\r\ninfluence of Cuvier; and it is through having assimilated Cuvier's\r\nteaching as to the importance of function that Meckel combats Geoffroy's\r\nlaw of connections, at least in its rigorous form. He submits that the\r\nconnections of bones and muscles must change in relation to functional\r\nrequirements. He rejects Geoffroy's theory of the vertebrate nature of\r\nArticulates. Generally throughout his work the functional point of view\r\nis well to the fore.\r\n\r\nYet at heart Meckel was a transcendentalist of the German school. His\r\nvagaries on the subject of \"homologues\" leave no doubt about that, and,\r\nin spite of Cuvier, he believed, though not very firmly, in the\r\nexistence of one single type of structure.\r\n\r\nA Cuverian by training, his lack of morphological sense threw him into\r\nthe ranks of the transcendentalists, to whom perhaps he belonged by\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n    [141] For a full account, see Kohlbrugge, _Zool.

But he was, though a staunch\r\ntranscendentalist, an eclectic of the older ideas current in his time;\r\nfor he picked out what was best in the older systems--Cuvier's\r\nteleology, Geoffroy's principle of connections, Oken's idea of the\r\nserial repetition of parts. In particular, he assimilated the teaching\r\nof Cuvier, the great opponent of the transcendentalists, and reconciled\r\nit in part with his own transcendentalism. His main theoretical views\r\nare to be found in his volume _On the Archetype and Homologies of the\r\nVertebrate Skeleton_ (London, 1848). The master-idea of the book is that\r\nthe vertebrate skeleton consists of a series of comparable segments,\r\neach of which Owen calls a vertebra. His definition of a vertebra is,\r\n\"one of those segments of the endo-skeleton which constitute the axis of\r\nthe body, and the protecting canals of the nervous and vascular trunks\"\r\n(p. 81). The parts of a typical vertebra are shown in Fig. 4, which is\r\ncopied from Owen's Fig. 14.\r\n\r\n                |||\r\n  zygapophysis  ||| -- neural spine\r\n             \\  |||\r\n              *//^\\\\*\r\ndiapophysis   //   \\\\ -- neurapohysis\r\n         \\   //  o  \\\\\r\n          ===== --- =====\r\n              /     \\\r\n       ===== |CENTRUM| O ===== -- peiurapophysis\r\n              \\     /\r\n          ===== --- =====\r\n         /    \\\\   //\r\nparapophysis  *\\\\v//*\r\n             /  |||\r\n  zygapophysis  ||| -- haemal spine\r\n                |||\r\n\r\nFIG. 4.--Ideal Typical Vertebra. (After Owen.)\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 5 (page 103) is shown an actual vertebra, as Owen conceives it,\r\nthe \"vertebra\" being that of a bird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Natural Typical Vertebra; Thorax of a Bird.\r\n(After Owen.)]\r\n\r\nA segment of sternum is included as the \"haemal spine\" of the vertebra\r\n(_hs_); the vertebral rib is the \"pleurapophysis\" (_pl_); the sternal\r\nrib the \"haemapophysis\" (_h_); the uncinate process of the vertebral rib\r\nis known as the \"diverging appendage\" (_a_). The whole vertebrate\r\nskeleton is composed of a series of vertebrae which show these typical\r\nparts. We arrive thus at the conception of an \"Archetype\" of the\r\nvertebrate skeleton, such as is represented in Fig. 6.\r\n\r\nThe archetype is only a scheme of what is usually constant in the\r\nvertebrate skeleton, and both the number and the arrangement of the\r\nbones in any real Vertebrate are subject to variation. \"It has been\r\nabundantly proved,\" Owen writes, towards the end of his volume, \"that\r\nthe idea of a natural segment (vertebra) of the endoskeleton does not\r\nnecessarily involve the presence of a particular number of pieces, or\r\neven a determinate and unchangeable arrangement of them. The great\r\nobject of my present labour has been to deduce ... the relative value\r\nand constancy of the different vertebral elements, and to trace the kind\r\nand extent of their variations within the limits of a plain and obvious\r\nmaintenance of a typical character\" (p. 146).\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that Owen considered the skull to be formed of\r\nvertebrae--the vertebral theory of the skull was, in his system, a\r\ndeduction from the vertebral theory of the skeleton. He recognised four\r\ncranial vertebrae; the arrangement of them, and the relation of their\r\nconstituent bones to the parts of the typical vertebra are shown in the\r\ntable appearing on page 106. So far as their first three elements are\r\nconcerned, these vertebrae are practically identical with the vertebrae\r\ndistinguished in the classical vertebral theory of the skull, as\r\nenunciated by Oken. A divergence appears with the determination of the\r\nother elements of the vertebrae. The upper and lower jaws are associated\r\nwith the nasal and frontal vertebrae respectively, not however as limbs\r\nof the head, but as constituent elements of these vertebrae. In the same\r\nway the hyoid apparatus is part and parcel of the parietal vertebra, and\r\nthe pectoral girdle and fore-limbs part of the occipital vertebra.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--The Archetype of the Vertebrate Skeleton.

In fish the pectoral\r\ngirdle is slung to the skull by means of the post-temporal bone\r\n(supra-scapula, according to Owen) which abuts on the occipital arch. In\r\n_Lepidosiren_, whose skeleton resembles the archetype in many ways, the\r\npectoral girdle is likewise attached to the occipital segment.\r\n\r\nIn most other Vertebrates the pectoral girdle has shifted backwards\r\nalong the vertebral column, by a \"metastasis\" (Geoffroy) similar to that\r\nby which the pelvic fins in many fish have shifted up close to the\r\npectoral girdle. The scapula (with supra-scapula) is the pleurapophysis,\r\nthe coracoid the haemapophysis, of the occipital vertebra. The clavicle\r\nis homologised with the slender bone in fish now known as the\r\npost-clavicle, which shows a connection with the first or atlas vertebra\r\nof the vertebral column, forming, according to Owen, the haemapophysis of\r\nthe atlas. Owen considers it no objection to this view that in other\r\nVertebrates the clavicle is anterior to the coracoid--\"its anterior\r\nposition to the coracoid in the air-breathing Vertebrata is no valid\r\nargument against the determination, since in these we have shown that\r\nthe true scapular arch is displaced backwards\" (_On the Nature of\r\nLimbs_, p. 63, London, 1849). In the pelvic girdle the ilium corresponds\r\nto the scapula, the ischium to the coracoid, the pubis to the clavicle.\r\nHence the ilium is a pleurapophysis, the ischium and pubis are both\r\nhaemapophyses. The fore-limb is the developed \"appendage\" of the\r\noccipital vertebra, the hind-limb the developed \"appendage\" of the\r\npelvic vertebra. They are serially homologous with, for example, the\r\nuncinate processes of the ribs in birds (see Figs. 5 and 6). The\r\nfore-limb is a simple filament in _Lepidosiren_, and presents few joints\r\nin _Proteus_ and _Amphiuma_; in other air-breathing Vertebrates it shows\r\na more complete development, the humerus, radius and ulna, and the bones\r\nof the wrist and hand becoming differentiated out.\r\n\r\nAs the fore-limb is equivalent to a single bone of the archetype, it is\r\nsaid to be, in its developed state, \"teleologically compound\" (p. 103).\r\n\r\nSince in the archetype every vertebra has its appendage, more than two\r\npairs of locomotory limbs might have been developed. \"Any given\r\nappendage might have been the seat of such developments as convert that\r\nof the pelvic arch into a locomotive limb; and the true insight into the\r\ngeneral homology of limbs leads us to recognise many potential pairs in\r\nthe typical endoskeleton. The possible and conceivable modifications of\r\nthe vertebrate archetype are far from having been exhausted in the forms\r\nwhich have hitherto been recognised, from the primaeval fishes of the\r\npalaeozoic ocean of this planet up to the present time\" (p. 102). It is\r\nnot of the essence of the vertebrate type to be tetrapodal.\r\n\r\nIn determining homologies Owen remained true to Geoffroy's principle of\r\nconnections. Speaking of an attempt which had been made to determine\r\nhomologies by the mode of development, he writes, \"There exists\r\ndoubtless a close general resemblance in the mode of development of\r\nhomologous parts; but this is subject to modification, like the forms,\r\nproportions, functions, and very substance of such parts, without their\r\nessential homological relationships being thereby obliterated. These\r\nrelationships are mainly, if not wholly, determined by the relative\r\nposition and connection of the parts, and may exist independently of\r\nform, proportions, substance, function and similarity of development.\r\nBut the connections must be sought for at every period of development,\r\nand the changes of relative position, if any, during growth, must be\r\ncompared with the connections which the part presents in the classes\r\nwhere vegetative repetition is greatest and adaptive modification least\"\r\n(p. 6). It is interesting to note that in Owen's opinion comparative\r\nanatomy explains embryology. Thus the scapula, which is the\r\npleurapophysis of the occipital vertebra, is vertical on its first\r\nappearance in the embryo of tetrapoda, and lies close up to the head\r\n(_On the Nature of Limbs_, p. 49)--the embryo shows a greater\r\nresemblance to the archetype than the adult. \"We perceive a return to\r\nit, as it were, in the early phases of development of the highest\r\norganised of the actually existing species, or we ought rather to say\r\nthat development starts from the old point; and thus, in regard to the\r\nscapula, we can explain the constancy of its first appearance close to\r\nthe head, whether in the human embryo or in that of the swan, also its\r\nvertical position to the axis of the spinal column, by its general\r\nhomology as the rib or 'pleurapophysis' of the occipital\r\nvertebra\" (_Limbs_, p. 56).\r\n\r\nWe owe to Owen the first clear distinction between \"homologous\" and\r\n\"analogous\" organs; it was he who first proposed the terms \"homologue\"\r\nand \"analogue,\" which he defined as follows:--\"_Analogue_. A part or\r\norgan in one animal which has the same function as another part or organ\r\nin a different animal.\" \"_Homologue_. The same organ in different\r\nanimals under every variety of form and function.\"[165]\r\n\r\nHe introduced also useful distinctions between Special, General, and\r\nSerial Homology. \"The relations of homology,\" he writes, \"are of three\r\nkinds: the first is that above defined, viz., the correspondency of a\r\npart or organ, determined by its relative position and connections, with\r\na part or organ in a different animal; the determination of which\r\nhomology indicates that such animals are constructed on a common type;\r\nwhen, for example, the correspondence of the basilar process of the\r\nhuman occipital bone with the distinct bone called 'basi-occipital' in a\r\nfish or crocodile is shown, the _special homology_ of that process is\r\ndetermined. A higher relation of homology is that in which a part or\r\nseries of parts stands to the fundamental or general type, and its\r\nenunciation involves and implies a knowledge of the type on which a\r\nnatural group of animals, the Vertebrate, for example, is constructed.\r\nThus when the basilar process of the human occipital bone is determined\r\nto be the 'centrum' or 'body' of the last cranial vertebra, its _general\r\nhomology_ is enunciated.\r\n\r\n\"If it be admitted that the general type of the vertebrate endoskeleton\r\nis rightly represented by the idea of a series of essentially similar\r\nsegments succeeding each other longitudinally from one end of the body\r\nto the other, such segments being for the most part composed of pieces\r\nsimilar in number and arrangement, and though sometimes extremely\r\nmodified for special functions, yet never so as to wholly mask their\r\ntypical character--then any given part of one segment may be repeated in\r\nthe rest of the series, just as one bone may be reproduced in the\r\nskeletons of different species, and this kind of repetition or\r\nrepresentative relation in the segments of the same skeleton I call\r\n'serial homology'\" (p. 7). As an example of serial homology we might\r\ntake the centra of the vertebrae--the vomer, the presphenoid, the\r\nbasisphenoid, the basioccipital and the series of centra in the spinal\r\ncolumn. Such serially repeated parts are called _homotypes_ (p. 8).\r\n\r\nNot all the bones of the vertebrate skeleton are included in the\r\narchetype as constituents of the vertebrae. Thus the branchial and\r\npharyngeal arches are accounted part of the splanchnoskeleton, as\r\nbelonging to the same category as the heart bone of some ruminants, and\r\nthe ossicles of the stomach in the lobster (p. 70). The ossicles of the\r\near in mammals are \"peculiar mammalian productions in relation to the\r\nexalted functions of a special organ of sense\" (p. 140, f.n.). This\r\nrecognition of a possible development of new organs to meet new\r\nfunctions shows unmistakably the influence of Cuvier. Owen was indeed\r\nwell aware of the importance of the functional aspect of living things,\r\nand he often adopted the teleological point of view. As a true\r\nmorphologist, however, he held that the principle of adaptation does not\r\nsuffice to explain the existence of special homologies. The ossification\r\nof the bones of the skull from separate centres may be purposive in\r\nEutheria, in that it prevents injury to the skull at birth; but how\r\nexplain on teleological principles the similar ossification from\r\nseparate centres in marsupials, birds and reptiles? How explain above\r\nall the fact that the centres are the same in number and relative\r\nposition in all these groups? Surely we must accept the idea of an\r\narchetype \"on which it has pleased the divine Architect to build up\r\ncertain of his diversified living works\" (p. 73).\r\n\r\nIn his study of centres of ossification, Owen made in point of theory a\r\ndistinct advance on his predecessors. We saw that Geoffroy recognised\r\nthe importance of studying the ossification of the skeleton, and that\r\nCuvier accepted such embryological evidence as an aid in determining\r\nhomologies. Owen pointed out that it was necessary to distinguish\r\nbetween centres of ossification which were teleological in import and\r\nsuch as were purely indicative of homological relationships. Many bones,\r\nsingle in the adult, arise from separate centres of ossification, but we\r\nmust distinguish between \"those centres of ossification that have\r\nhomological relations, and those that have only teleological ones;\r\n_i.e._, between the separate points of ossification of a human bone\r\nwhich typify vertebral elements, often permanently distinct bones in the\r\nlower animals; and the separate points which, without such\r\nsignification, facilitate the progress of osteogeny, and have for their\r\nobvious final cause the well-being of the growing animal\" (p. 105).\r\nThere is, for example, a teleological reason why in mammals and leaping\r\nAmphibia (_e.g._, frogs), the long bones should ossify first at their\r\nends, for the brain is thus protected from concussion; in reptiles that\r\ncreep there is less danger of concussion, and the long bones ossify in\r\nthe middle (p. 105). But there is no teleological reason why the\r\ncoracoid process of the scapula should in all mammals develop from a\r\nseparate centre. The coracoid is however a real vertebral element\r\n(haemapophysis), and in monotremes, birds and reptiles it is in the adult\r\na large and separate bone. Its ossification from a separate centre in\r\nmammals has therefore a homological significance. The scapula in mammals\r\nis an example of what Owen calls a \"homologically compound\" bone. All\r\nthose bones which are formed by a coalescence of parts answering to\r\ndistinct elements of the typical vertebra are \"homologically compound\"\r\n(p. 105). On the other hand, \"All those bones which represent single\r\nvertebral elements are 'teleologically compound' when developed from\r\nmore than one centre, whether such centres subsequently coalesce, or\r\nremain distinct, or even become the subject of individual adaptive\r\nmodifications, with special joints, muscles, etc., for particular\r\noffices\" (p. 106). The limb-skeleton, corresponding as it does to a\r\nsingle bone of the archetype, is the typical example of a teleologically\r\ncompound bone. Owen in his definition of teleological compoundness has\r\ncombined two kinds of adaptation--(1) temporary adaptation of bones to\r\nthe exigencies of development, birth and growth (_e.g._, development of\r\nlong bones from separate centres); (2) definitive adaptation of a\r\nskeletal part to the functions which it has to perform (_e.g._,\r\nteleological structure of limbs). Such adaptations are, so to speak,\r\ngrafted on the archetype.\r\n\r\nOwen's general views on the nature of living things merit some\r\nattention. Organic forms, according to Owen, result from the\r\nantagonistic working of two principles, of which one brings about a\r\nvegetative repetition of structure, while the other, a teleological\r\nprinciple, shapes the living thing to its functions. The former\r\nprinciple is illustrated in the archetype of the vertebrate skeleton, in\r\nthe segmentation of the Articulates, in the almost mathematical symmetry\r\nof Echinoderms, and the actually crystalline spicules of sponges. It is\r\nthe same principle which causes repetition of the forms of crystals in\r\nthe inorganic world. \"The repetition of similar segments in a vertebral\r\ncolumn, and of similar elements in a vertebral segment, is analogous to\r\nthe repetition of similar crystals as the result of polarising force in\r\nthe growth of an inorganic body\" (p. 171). This \"general polarising\r\nforce\" it is which mainly produces the similarity of forms, the\r\nrepetition of parts, and generally the signs of the unity of\r\norganisation. The adaptive or \"special organising force\" or [Greek:\r\nidea], on the other hand, produces the diversity of organic beings. In\r\nevery species these two forces are at work, and the extent to which the\r\ngeneral polarising or \"vegetative-repetition-force\" is subdued by the\r\nteleological is an index of the grade of the species.\r\n\r\nThis view is analogous to the Geoffroyan conception that the diversity\r\nof form is limited by the unity of plan. Owen thus ranges himself with\r\nGeoffroy against Cuvier, who considered that diversity of form is\r\nlimited only by the principle of the adaptation of parts.\r\n\r\n    [164] Owen introduced most of the names of bones now\r\n    current.\r\n\r\n    [165] _Lectures on Invertebrate Animals_, pp. 374, 379,\r\n    1843.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nKARL ERNST VON BAER\r\n\r\n\r\nVon Baer was recognised as the founder of embryology even by his\r\ncontemporaries. His predecessors, Aristotle,[166] Fabricius,[167]\r\nHarvey,[168] Malpighi,[169] Haller,[170] Wolff,[171] had made a\r\nbeginning with the study of development; von Baer, by the thoroughness\r\nof his observation and the strength of his analysis, made embryology a\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nIt was to one of the German transcendentalists that von Baer owed the\r\nimpulse to study development. Ignatius Doellinger, Professor in Wuerzburg,\r\ninduced three of his pupils, Pander, d'Alton and von Baer, to devote\r\nthemselves to embryological research. The development of animals was at\r\nthis time little known, in spite of recent work by Meckel (1815 and\r\n1817), Tiedemann (_Anatomie u. Bildungsgeschichte des Gehirns_, 1816),\r\nby Oken (_loc. cit., supra_, p. 90), and some others.\r\n\r\nPander, with whom apparently Doellinger and d'Alton collaborated, was the\r\nfirst to publish his results;[172] von Baer, who through absence from\r\nWuerzburg had for a time dropped his embryological studies, started to\r\nwork in 1819, after the publication of Pander's treatise, and produced\r\nin 1828 the first volume of his master-work, _Ueber\r\nEntwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere. Beobachtung und Reflexion_\r\n(Koenigsberg, 1828). The second volume followed in 1837, but dates really\r\nfrom 1834, and was published in an incomplete form. This second volume\r\nis intended as an introduction to embryology for the use of doctors and\r\nscience students. In it von Baer describes in full detail the\r\ndevelopment of many vertebrate types--chick, tortoise, snake, lizard,\r\nfrog, fish, several mammals and man, basing his remarks largely upon his\r\npersonal observations, but taking account also of all contemporary work.\r\nA separate account of the development of a fish (_Cyprinus blicca_)\r\nappeared in 1835.[173]\r\n\r\nWe shall concentrate attention on the first volume. This volume contains\r\nthe first full and adequate account of the development of the chick,\r\nfollowed by a masterly discussion of the laws of development in general.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that von Baer worked chiefly with a simple microscope\r\nand dissecting needles, the minuteness and accuracy of his observations\r\nare astonishing. He described the main facts respecting the development\r\nof all the principal organs, and if, through lack of the proper means of\r\nobservation, he erred in detail, he made up for it by his masterly\r\nunderstanding and profound analysis of the essential nature of\r\ndevelopment. His account of the development of the chick is a model of\r\nwhat a scientific memoir ought to be; the series of \"Scholia\" which\r\nfollow contain the deductions he made from the data, and, in so far as\r\nthey are direct generalisations from experience, they are valid for all\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe first Scholion is directed against the theory of preformation, and\r\nsucceeds in refuting it on the ground of simple observation. The theme\r\nof the second Scholion is that the essential nature (_die Wesenheit_) of\r\nthe animal determines its differentiation, that no stage of development\r\nis solely determined by the antecedent stage, but that throughout all\r\nstages the _Wesenheit_ or idea of the definitive whole exercises\r\nguidance. This guidance is shown most clearly in the regulatory\r\nprocesses of the germ, whereby the large individual variations commonly\r\npresented by the early embryo are compensated for or neutralised in the\r\ncourse of further development. Baer in this shows himself a vitalist.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the third and subsequent Scholia which must here\r\nparticularly occupy our attention, for it is in these that von Baer\r\ncomes to grips with morphological problems. Already in the second\r\nScholion he had definitely enunciated the law which runs as a theme\r\nthroughout the volume, the observational and the theoretical part alike,\r\nthe law that development is essentially a process of differentiation by\r\nwhich the germ becomes ever more and more individualised. \"The essential\r\nresult of development,\" he writes, \"when we consider it as a whole, is\r\nthe increasing independence (_Selbstaendigkeit_) of the developing\r\nanimal\" (p. 148). In the third Scholion he elaborates this thought and\r\nshows that differentiation takes place in triple wise. The three\r\nprocesses of differentiation are \"primary differentiation\" or\r\nlayer-formation, \"histological differentiation\" within the layers, and\r\nthe \"morphological differentiation\" of primitive organs.\r\n\r\nThe first of these differentiations in time is the formation of the\r\ngerm-layers, which takes place by a splitting or separation of the\r\nblastoderm into a series of superimposed lamellae. Baer's account of the\r\nprocess in the chick is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"First of all, the germ separates out into heterogeneous layers, which\r\nwith advancing development acquire ever greater individuality, but even\r\non their first appearance show rudiments of the structures which will\r\ncharacterise them later. Thus in the germ of the bird, so soon as it\r\nacquires consistency at the beginning of incubation, we can distinguish\r\nan upper smooth continuous surface and a lower more granular surface.\r\nThe blastoderm separates thereupon into two distinct layers, of which\r\nthe lower develops into the plastic body-parts of the embryo, the upper\r\ninto the animal parts; the lower shows clearly a further division into\r\ntwo closely connected subsidiary layers--the mucous layer and the\r\nvessel-layer; the original upper layer also shows a division into two,\r\nwhich form respectively the skin and the parts which I have called the\r\ntrue ventral and dorsal plates--parts which contain in an\r\nundifferentiated state the skeletal and muscular systems, the connective\r\ntissues, and the nerves belonging to these. In order to have a\r\nconvenient term for future use, I have named this layer the\r\nmuscle-layer\" (p. 153).\r\n\r\nThe process of delamination results then in the formation of four\r\nlayers, of which the upper two (composing the \"animal\" or \"serous\"\r\nlayer) will give origin to the animal (neuromuscular) part of the body,\r\nthe lower pair to the plastic or vegetative organs. The uppermost layer\r\nwill form the external covering of the embryo, and also the amniotic\r\nfolds; from it there differentiates out at a very early stage the\r\nrudiment of the central nervous system, forming a more or less\r\nindependent layer. Below the outermost layer lies the layer from which\r\nare formed the muscular and skeletal systems, and beneath this\r\n\"muscle-layer\" comes the \"vessel-layer,\" which gives origin to the main\r\nblood-vessels. The innermost layer of the four will form the mucous\r\nmembrane of the alimentary canal and its dependencies; at the present\r\nstage, however, it is, like the other layers, a flat plate.\r\n\r\nFrom all these layers tubes are developed by the simple bending round of\r\ntheir edges. The outermost layer becomes the investing skin-tube of the\r\nembryo; the layer for the nervous system forms the tubular rudiment of\r\nthe brain and spinal cord; the mucous layer curls round to form the\r\nalimentary tube; the muscle layer grows upwards and downwards to form\r\nthe fleshy and osseous tube of the body wall; even the vessel layer\r\nforms a tube investing the alimentary canal, but a part of it goes to\r\nform the medial \"Gekroese,\" or mesenterial complex, which departs\r\nconsiderably from the tubular form.\r\n\r\nWhen these tubes or \"fundamental organs\" are formed the process of\r\nprimary differentiation is complete. The fundamental organs, however,\r\nhave at no time actually the form of tubes; they exist as tubes only\r\nideally, for morphological and histological differentiation go on\r\nconcurrently with the process of primary differentiation.\r\n\r\nThrough morphological differentiation the various parts of the\r\nfundamental organs become specialised, through unequal growth, first\r\ninto the primitive organs and then into the functional organs of the\r\nbody. \"Single sections of the tubes originally formed from the layers\r\ndevelop individual forms, which later acquire special functions: these\r\nfunctions are in the most general way subordinate elements of the\r\nfunction of the whole tube, but yet differ from the functions of other\r\nsections. Thus the nerve-tube differentiates into sense-organs, brain\r\nand spinal cord, the alimentary tube into mouth cavity, oesophagus,\r\nstomach, intestine, respiratory apparatus, liver, bladder, etc. This\r\nspecialisation in development is bound up with increased or diminished\r\ngrowth\" (p. 155). Rapid growth concentrated at one point brings about an\r\nevagination; in this manner are formed the sense-organs from the\r\nnerve-tube, the liver and lungs from the alimentary tube. Or increased\r\ngrowth over a section of a tube causes it to swell out; in this wise the\r\nbrain develops from the nerve-tube, the stomach from the alimentary\r\ntube. The segmentation which soon becomes so marked, particularly in the\r\nmuscle layer, is also due to a process of morphological differentiation.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the organs of the body are being thus roughly\r\nblocked out and moulded from the germ-layers the third process of\r\ndifferentiation is actively going on. \"In addition to the\r\ndifferentiation of the layers, there follows later another\r\ndifferentiation in the substance of the layers, whereby cartilage,\r\nmuscle and nerve separate out, a part also of the mass becoming fluid\r\nand entering the bloodstream\" (p. 154). Through histological\r\ndifferentiation the texture of the layers and incipient organs becomes\r\nindividualised. In its earliest appearance the germ consists of an\r\nalmost homogeneous mass, containing clear or dark globules suspended in\r\nits substance (ii., p. 92). This homogeneity gives place to\r\nheterogeneity; the structureless mass becomes fibrous to form muscles,\r\nhardens to form cartilage or bone, becomes liquid to form the blood,\r\ndifferentiates in a hundred other ways--into absorbing and secreting\r\ntissues, into nerves and ganglia, and so forth. It will be noticed that\r\nthe concept of histological differentiation is independent of the\r\ncell-theory; it signifies that textural differentiation which leads to\r\nthe formation of tissues in Bichat's sense. The tissues and the\r\ngerm-layers stand in fairly close relation with one another, for while\r\ncertain tissues are formed chiefly but not exclusively in one layer,\r\nothers are formed only in one layer and never elsewhere. For example,\r\nperipheral nerves are for the most part formed in the muscle layer,\r\nthough the bulk of the nervous tissue is formed in the walls of the\r\nnerve tube; similarly blood and blood-vessels may arise from almost any\r\nlayer, though their chief seat of origin is the vessel-layer; on the\r\nother hand, bone is formed only in the muscle-layer (i., p. 155, ii.,\r\npp. 92-3).\r\n\r\nThis relation of tissue to germ-layer was more fully discussed and\r\nbrought into greater prominence by Remak, from the standpoint of the\r\ncell-theory, and it will occupy us in a later chapter (Chap. XII.).\r\n\r\nThe fourth Scholion elaborates the analysis of developmental processes\r\nstill further, and discusses in particular the scheme of development\r\nwhich is shown by the Vertebrata. The characteristic structure of the\r\nvertebrate body is brought about by a \"double symmetrical\" rolling\r\ntogether of the germ-layers, whereby two main tubes are formed, one\r\nabove and one below the axis of the body, which is the chorda. The\r\ndorsal tube is formed by the two animal layers, the ventral tube by all\r\nthe layers combined (see Fig. 7).\r\n\r\nThe process is indicated with sufficient clearness in the diagram. It\r\nwill be seen that the real foundation and framework of the arrangement\r\nis the muscle-layer, with its two tubes, one surrounding the central\r\nnervous system and forming the \"dorsal plates,\" the other surrounding\r\nthe body cavity and forming the \"ventral plates.\" In the dorsal plates,\r\nwhich early show metameric segmentation, the investing skeleton of the\r\nneural axis develops; in the ventral plates are formed the ribs, the\r\nventral arches of the vertebrae, the hyoid, the lower jaw and other\r\nskeletal structures.\r\n\r\nThe alimentary or \"mucous\" tube and the part of the vessel layer which\r\ninvests it become so closely bound up with one another as to form a\r\nsingle primitive organ--the alimentary canal. The muscles of the\r\nalimentary canal are accordingly in all probability developed in the\r\ninvesting part of the vessel layer. From the \"Gekroese,\" or remaining\r\npart of the vessel layer develop the Wolffian bodies (_Urnieren_,\r\nPronephros), the kidneys, the sex glands, and the series of\r\n\"blood-glands\"--suprarenals, thyroid, thymus and spleen. Baer did not\r\nattach any special morphological significance to the peritoneal lining\r\nof the body cavity, as is done in more modern forms of the germ-layer\r\ntheory. The gill-slits were largely formed by outgrowths from the\r\nalimentary canal.\r\n\r\n_a._ Chorda.\r\n_b._ Dorsal plates.\r\n_c._ Ventral plates.\r\n_d._ Spinal cord.\r\n_e._ Vessel-layer.\r\n_f._ Alimentary tube.\r\n_g._ Pronephros.\r\n_h._ Skin.\r\n_i._ Amnion.\r\n_k._ Serous membrane.\r\n_l._ Yolk-sac.\r\n\r\nIn his germ-layer theory von Baer was influenced a good deal by\r\nPander, to whom the actual discovery of the process of layer-formation\r\nis due. Pander, however, had distinguished only three germ-layers, an\r\nupper \"serous\" layer, a lower \"mucous\" layer and a middle\r\n\"vessel-layer.\" He it was who introduced the terms \"Keimhaut\"\r\n(blastoderm) and \"Keimblatt\" (germ-layer).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Ideal Transverse Section of a Vertebrate Embryo.\r\n(After von Baer.)]\r\n\r\nThe honour of being the founder of the germ-layer theory is sometimes\r\nattributed to C. F. Wolff, notably by Koelliker and O. Hertwig. Wolff, it\r\nis true, in his memoir _De formatione intestinorum_ (1768-9) showed that\r\nthe alimentary canal was first formed as a flat plate which folded round\r\nto form a tube, and in a somewhat vaguely worded passage he hinted that\r\na similar mode of origin might be found to hold good for the other\r\norgan-systems. But it seems clear that Wolff had no definite conception\r\nof the process of layer-formation as the first and necessary step in all\r\ndifferentiation. This, at any rate, was von Baer's opinion, who assigns\r\nto Pander the glory of the discovery of the germ-layers. \"You,\" he\r\nwrites, \"through your clearer recognition of the splitting of the\r\ngerm--a process which remained dark to Wolff--have shed a light upon all\r\nforms of development\" (p. xxi.).\r\n\r\nWe have now seen, following von Baer's exposition, how development is\r\nessentially a process of differentiation, a progress from the general to\r\nthe special, from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous; we have analysed\r\nthe process into its three subordinate processes--primary, histological\r\nand morphological differentiation. So far we have considered development\r\nin general and the laws which govern it; we have now to consider the\r\nvarieties of development which the animal kingdom offers in such\r\nprofusion, in order to discover what relations exist between them. This\r\nis the problem set in the fifth Scholion. Baer at once brings us face to\r\nface with the solution of the problem attempted in the Meckel-Serres\r\nlaw. It is a generally received opinion, he writes, that the higher\r\nanimals repeat in their development the adult stages of the lower, and\r\nthis is held to be the essential law governing the relation of the\r\nvariety of development to the variety of adult form. This opinion arose\r\nwhen there was little real knowledge of embryology; it threw light\r\nindeed upon certain cases of monstrous development, but it was pushed\r\naltogether too far. It complicated itself with a belief in a historical\r\nevolution;--\"People gradually learnt to think of the different animal\r\nforms as developed one from another--and seemed, in some circles at\r\nleast, determined to forget that this metamorphosis could only be\r\nconceptual\" (p. 200). At the same time the theory of parallelism led men\r\nto rehabilitate the outworn conception of the scale of beings, to\r\nmaintain that animals form one single series of increasing complexity, a\r\nscale which the higher members must mount step by step in their\r\ndevelopment--from which it followed that evolution, whether conceived as\r\nan ideal or as an historical process, could take place only along one\r\nline, could be only progressive or regressive. Not all the supporters of\r\nthe theory of parallelism held these extreme views, but conclusions of\r\nthis kind were natural and logical enough.\r\n\r\nVon Baer had soon found in the course of his embryological studies that\r\nthe facts did not at all fit in with the doctrine of parallelism; the\r\ndeveloping chick, for example, was at a very early stage demonstrably a\r\nVertebrate, and did not recapitulate in its early stages the\r\norganisation of a polyp, a worm or a mollusc. He had published his\r\ndoubts in 1823, but his final confutation of the theory of parallelism\r\nis found in this Scholion.\r\n\r\nIf it were true, he says, that the essential thing in the development of\r\nan animal is this repetition of lower organisations, then certain\r\ndeductions could be drawn, which one would expect to find confirmed in\r\nNature. The first deduction would be that no structures should appear in\r\nthe embryo of the higher animals that are not found in the lower\r\nanimals. But this is not confirmed by the facts--no adult among the\r\nlower animals, for instance, has a yolk-sac like that of the chick\r\nembryo. Again, if the law of parallelism were true, the mammalian embryo\r\nwould have to repeat the organisation of, among other groups, insects\r\nand birds. But the embryo _in utero_ is surrounded by fluid and cannot\r\npossibly breathe free air, so it cannot possibly repeat the structure of\r\neither insects or birds, which are pre-eminently air-organisms.\r\nGenerally speaking, indeed, we find in all the higher embryos special\r\nstructures which adapt them to the very special conditions of their\r\ndevelopment, and these we never find as permanent structures in the\r\nlower animals. The supporters of the theory of parallelism might,\r\nhowever, admit the existence of such special embryonic organs without\r\ngreatly prejudicing their case, for these temporary organs stand to some\r\nextent outside the scope of the theory.\r\n\r\nBut they would have to face a second and more important deduction from\r\ntheir views, namely, that the higher animals should repeat at every\r\nstage of their development the whole organisation of some lower animal,\r\nand not merely agree with them in isolated details of structure. The\r\ndeduction is, however, not borne out by the facts. The embryo of a\r\nmammal resembles in many points, at different stages of its development,\r\nthe adult state of a fish; it has gill-slits and complete aortic arches,\r\na two-chambered heart, and so on. But at no time does it combine all the\r\nessential characters of a fish; nor has it ever the tail of a fish, nor\r\nthe fins, nor the shape. Any recapitulation there may be is a\r\nrecapitulation of single organs, there is never a repetition of the\r\ncomplete organisation of a fish. This is indeed the fundamental\r\ncriticism of the theory of parallelism; and if it applies even within\r\nthe limits of the vertebrate phylum, so much the more does it apply to\r\ncomparisons between embryonic Vertebrates and adult Invertebrates.\r\n\r\nThere are also some lesser arguments which might be urged against the\r\ntheory of parallelism. If the theory were strictly true, no state which\r\nis permanent in a higher animal could be passed through by an animal\r\nlower in the scale. But birds, which are lower in the scale than\r\nmammals, pass through a stage in which they resemble mammals in certain\r\nrespects much more than they do when adult, for in an embryonic\r\ncondition they agree with mammals in having no feathers, no air sacs, no\r\npneumatic sacs in the bones, no beak. Their brain also resembles that of\r\nmammals more in an earlier stage than it does later. So, too, myriapods\r\nand hydrachnids have at birth three pairs of feet, and resemble at this\r\nstage adult insects, which form a higher class.\r\n\r\nAgain, were the analogy between the development of the individual and\r\nthe evolution of the _Echelle des etres_ complete, organs and\r\norgan-systems ought to develop in the individual in the order in which\r\nthey appear in the scale of beings. But this is not always the case. In\r\nfish the hinder extremity develops only its terminal joint, while in the\r\nembryos of higher animals the basal joint is the first to appear.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence one would expect to find realised, were the theory\r\nof parallelism correct, is the late appearance in development of parts\r\nwhich are confined to the higher animals. In the development of a\r\nVertebrate accordingly one would not expect the vertebrae to appear\r\nbefore the embryo had passed through many Invertebrate stages. But\r\nexperience shows the direct contrary, for in the chick the rudiments of\r\nthe vertebral axis appear sooner than any other part.\r\n\r\nThe theory of parallelism or recapitulation then is not borne out by the\r\nfacts, and clearly cannot be the law which we are seeking. But what then\r\nis the true relation between the variety of development and the variety\r\nof adult structure? Before answering this question we must review the\r\nvaried forms of adult organisation and consider in what relations they\r\nstand to one another. In particular we must enquire whether they belong\r\nto one type or to many. One point is here cardinal--we must distinguish\r\nbetween the _type_ of organisation and the _grade_ of differentiation.\r\nBy \"type\" von Baer means the structural plan of the organism. \"I call\r\nthe _type_ the spatial relationship of the organic elements and organs\"\r\n(p. 208). Each type of organisation characterises one of the big groups\r\nof animals; the lesser groups represent \"grade\" modifications of the\r\ntype. \"The product of the degree of differentiation and the type gives\r\nthe several great groups of animals which are called classes\" (p. 208).\r\n_Ausbildung_ (differentiation) takes place in one or other of several\r\ndirections, in adaptation, for instance, to life in the water or to life\r\nin the air.\r\n\r\nThere are, von Baer considers, four main types--(1) the peripheral or\r\nradiate type, (2) the longitudinal type, (3) the massive or molluscan\r\ntype, (4) the vertebrate type. The radiate type is shown by discoid\r\ninfusoria, by medusae, by starfish and their allies. The longitudinal\r\ntype characterises such genera as _Vibrio_, _Filaria_, _Gordius_, and\r\nall the annulate animals. Mollusca, rotifers, polyzoa, and such\r\ninfusoria as are not included in types (1) and (2) belong to the massive\r\ntype, in which the body and its parts form rounded masses. The\r\nlongitudinal type is predominantly \"animal,\" the massive type\r\npredominantly \"plastic\" (vegetative). The vertebrate type has both the\r\n\"animal\" and the \"plastic\" organs highly developed. In the symmetrical\r\narrangement of the animal parts it resembles the longitudinal type; its\r\nplastic parts with their asymmetrical arrangement and rounded shape\r\nbelong to the massive type.\r\n\r\nThese types of von Baer inevitably recall the \"Embranchements\" of\r\nCuvier, with which they more or less coincide. It seems that von Baer\r\narrived at his types (from the study of adult structure) independently\r\nof Cuvier, though the priority of publication rests with Cuvier.[174]\r\n\r\nNow it is clear that the development of the individual, which is\r\nessentially an _Ausbildung_, a differentiation, is directly comparable\r\nwith the grade-differentiation of forms within the type. And just as the\r\ntype rules all its varied modifications, so does the development of the\r\nindividual take place always within the bounds imposed by type. This is\r\nvon Baer's chief contribution to the theory of embryonic\r\nrelationships--the law that \"the type of organisation determines the\r\nmanner of development\" (p. xxii.). Development is not merely from the\r\ngeneral to the special--there are at least four distinct \"general\"\r\ntypes, from which the special is developed. The type is fixed in the\r\nvery earliest stages of development--the embryo of a Vertebrate is from\r\nthe very beginning a Vertebrate (p. 220), and it shows at no time any\r\nagreement in total organisation with any Invertebrate. The types are\r\nindependent of one another; differentiation and development follow a\r\ndifferent course in each of them. Not but what some analogies can be\r\nfound between the very earliest stages of embryos of different type.\r\nThus vertebrate and annulate embryos agree in certain points at the time\r\nof the formation of the primitive streak. And in the earliest stage of\r\nall, the egg-stage, there is probably agreement between all the types.\r\nIn eggs with yolk, whether vertebrate or annulate, there is always a\r\nseparation into an animal and a plastic layer. It seems, too, as if a\r\nhollow sphere were a constant stage in the development of all animals\r\n(pp. 224, 258). Apart from these analogies, development takes an\r\nentirely independent course in each of the four main types, and no\r\nembryo of one of the higher types repeats in its development the\r\npeculiar organisation of any adult of the lower types.\r\n\r\nIf we consider now development within the type, which is the only\r\nlegitimate thing to do, we arrive at certain laws governing the relation\r\nof embryos to one another. For instance, at a certain stage vertebrate\r\nembryos are uncommonly alike. Von Baer had two in spirit which he was\r\nunable to assign to their class among amniotes; they might have been\r\nlizard, bird, or mammal, he could not say definitely which.[175] Generally\r\nthe farther back we go in the development of Vertebrates the more alike\r\nwe find the embryos. The type-characters are first to appear, then the\r\nclass characters, then the characters distinguishing the lesser\r\nclassificatory groups. \"From a more general type the special gradually\r\nemerges\" (p. 221). The chick is first a Vertebrate, then a\r\nland-vertebrate, then a bird, then a land-bird, then a gallinaceous\r\nbird, and finally _Gallus domesticus_. Development within the type is a\r\nprogress from the general to the special, a real evolution. The more\r\ndivergent two adults are, the farther back we must go in their\r\ndevelopment to find an agreement between their embryos. We can sum up\r\nthe case in the following laws:--\r\n\r\n\"(1) _That the general characters of the big group to which the embryo\r\nbelongs appear in development earlier than the special characters._ In\r\nagreement with this is the fact that the vesicular form is the most\r\ngeneral form of all; for what is common in a greater degree to all\r\nanimals than the opposition of an internal and an external surface?\r\n\r\n\"(2) _The less general structural relations are formed after the more\r\ngeneral, and so on until the most special appear._\r\n\r\n\"(3) _The embryo of any given form, instead of passing through the state\r\nof other definite forms, on the contrary separates itself from them._\r\n\r\n\"(4) _Fundamentally the embryo of a higher animal form never resembles\r\nthe adult of another animal form, but only its embryo_\" (p. 224).\r\n\r\nThese laws relating to development within the limits of type are\r\ndestructive of even a limited application of the theory of parallelism,\r\nfor not even within the limits of the type is there a real scale which\r\nthe higher forms must mount; each embryo develops for itself, and\r\ndiverges sooner or later from the embryos of other species, the\r\ndivergence coming earlier the greater the difference between the adult\r\nforms. It is only because the lower less-differentiated adult forms\r\nhappen to be little divergent from the generalised or embryonic type,\r\nthat they show a certain similarity with the embryos of the higher more\r\ndifferentiated members of the group. Such similarity, however, is due to\r\nno necessary law governing the development of the higher animals; it is,\r\non the contrary, merely a consequence of the organisation of these lower\r\nanimals (p. 224).\r\n\r\nVon Baer goes on to show what are the distinguishing embryological\r\ncharacters of the types and classes, working out a dichotomous schema of\r\ndevelopment, which each embryo must follow, branching off early or late\r\nto its terminal point, according to the lower or higher goal it has to\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nOne important consequence for morphology results from von Baer's laws of\r\ndifferentiation within the type. If the embryo develops from the general\r\nto the special, then the state in which each organ or organ-system first\r\nappears must represent the general or typical state of that organ within\r\nthe group. Embryology will therefore be of great assistance to\r\ncomparative anatomy, whose chief aim it is to discover the generalised\r\ntype, the common plan of structure, upon which the animals of each big\r\ngroup are built. And the surest way to determine the true homologies of\r\nparts will be to study their early development. \"For since each organ\r\nbecomes what it is only through the manner of its development, its true\r\nvalue can be recognised only from its method of formation. At present,\r\nwe form our judgments by an undefined intuition, instead of regarding\r\neach organ merely as an isolated product of its fundamental organ, and\r\ndiscerning from this standpoint the correspondences and dissimilarities\r\nin the different types\" (p. 233). Parts, therefore, which develop from\r\nthe same \"fundamental organ,\" and in the last resort from the same\r\ngerm-layer, have a certain kinship, which may even reach the degree of\r\nexact homology.\r\n\r\nNow since the mode of development in each type is peculiar to that type,\r\norgans of the same name in different types must not necessarily be\r\naccounted homologous, even if they correspond exactly with one another\r\nin their general _functional_ relations to the rest of the organs. Thus\r\nthe central nervous system of Arthropods must not be homologised with\r\nthe central nervous system of Vertebrates, for it develops in a\r\ndifferent manner. So, too, the brain of Arthropods or of Mollusca is not\r\nstrictly comparable with the brain of Vertebrates. Again, the air-tubes\r\nor tracheae of insects are, like the trachea and bronchi of many\r\nVertebrates, air-breathing organs. But the two organs are not\r\nhomologous, for the air-tubes of Vertebrates are developed from the\r\nalimentary tube (\"fundamental organ\" of the alimentary system, developed\r\nfrom the vegetative layer), while the air-tubes of insects arise either\r\nby histological differentiation, or by invagination of the skin (p.\r\n236). Organs can be homologous only within the limits of the big groups;\r\nthere can be no question of homology between members of different types.\r\n\r\nThe development of plants, like the development of animals, is\r\nessentially a progress from the general to the special (p. 242).\r\nBotanists have not been troubled by any recapitulation theory, and in\r\nfounding their big groups, Acotyledons, Monocotyledons, and\r\nDicotyledons, upon embryological characters, they were guided by true\r\nprinciples, which ought indeed to be followed in zoology. If we knew the\r\ndevelopment of all kinds of animals sufficiently well, then the best way\r\nto classify them would be according to the characters they show in their\r\nearly development, for it is in early development that they show the\r\ncharacters of the type in their most generalised form. As it is, we have\r\nin our ignorance to establish the big groups by the study of adult\r\nstructure, but we find, on putting together all we know of comparative\r\nembryology, that a classification of animals according to the mode of\r\ntheir development gives, as is only natural, the same four groups as\r\ndoes the study of adult structure. The four types of development are\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n(1) The double-symmetrical, which is found in Vertebrates. It is called\r\nthe double-symmetrical, because in Vertebrates development takes place\r\nfrom a central axis (notochord) in two directions, upwards and\r\ndownwards, in such a way that two tubes are formed, one above and one\r\nbelow the axis. (2) The second type is the symmetrical, which is shown\r\nby Annulates. A primitive streak is formed on the ventral surface of the\r\nyolk; development proceeds symmetrically on both sides of the streak.\r\n(3) Radiate development is probably typical of the radiate structural\r\ntype. (4) In the massive type, the development seems to be a spiral one.\r\n\r\nCommon to most modes is a separation of the germ into animal and plastic\r\nlayers, a separation which seems to be conditioned largely by the\r\npresence of yolk. A classification based upon embryological characters\r\nought to be applied even to the lesser groups and would here prove\r\nitself of service. Embryology, for instance, fully supports de\r\nBlainville's separation of Batrachia from true reptiles,[176] for reptiles\r\ndevelop an amnion and Batrachia do not.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the sixth and last Scholion. Development is a true\r\nevolution of the special from the general, so runs von Baer's most\r\ngeneral law of all. This can be expressed in a slightly different way,\r\nand the words which he chooses in the sixth Scholion to express this\r\nfinal and most general result are these:--\"The developmental history of\r\nthe individual is the history of the growing individuality in every\r\nrespect\" (p. 263). The greatest modern treatise on embryology ends on a\r\nsplendid note. One creative thought rules all the forms of life. And\r\nmore--\"It is this same thought that in cosmic space gathered the\r\nscattered masses into spheres and bound them together in the solar\r\nsystem, the same that from the weathered dust on the surface of the\r\nmetallic planets brought forth the forms of life. And this thought is\r\nnought else but life itself, and the words and syllables in which life\r\nexpresses itself are the varied forms of the living\" (p. 264).\r\n\r\nVon Baer reminds one greatly of Cuvier. There is the same sheer\r\nintellectual power, the same sanity of mind, the same synthetic grip.\r\nVon Baer, like Cuvier, never forgot that he was working with living\r\nthings; he was saturated, like Cuvier, with the sense of their\r\nfunctional adaptedness. In his paper on the external and internal\r\nskeleton[177] he gives a masterly analysis of the functional modifications\r\nof the limbs in Vertebrates, and the whole paper indeed, with its sober\r\nattack on transcendentalism, is a vindication as much of the functional\r\npoint of view as of the importance of embryology.\r\n\r\nBoth Cuvier and von Baer, by the very sanity of their views, found\r\nthemselves in partial opposition to the theories current in their time.\r\nCuvier was the critic of Geoffroy and the transcendentalists, of Lamarck\r\nand the believers in the _Echelle des etres_, evolutionary or ideal. Von\r\nBaer also, though influenced greatly by _Naturphilosophie_, turned\r\nagainst the exaggerations of the transcendental school, and by his\r\nunanswerable criticism of the theory of parallelism took away the ground\r\nfrom those who too easily believed in an historical evolution.[178]\r\n\r\nWe have seen what were von Baer's criticisms of the theory of\r\nparallelism. If we turn to the later writings of Cuvier we find the\r\nessential criticism expressed in similar terms. Speaking of an attempt\r\nwhich had been made to show that fish were molluscs developed to a\r\nhigher degree, he wrote in 1828,[179] \"Let us draw the conclusion that\r\neven if these animals can be spoken of as ennobled molluscs, as molluscs\r\nraised to a higher power, or if they are embryos of reptiles, the\r\nbeginnings of reptiles, this can be true of them only in an abstract and\r\nmetaphysical sense, and that even this abstract statement would be very\r\nfar from giving an accurate idea of their organisation.\" From the fact\r\nthat the respiratory and circulatory organs of fish greatly resemble\r\nthose of tadpoles the conclusion has been drawn that fish are in a sense\r\nembryos of Amphibia (p. 547). But this manner of viewing things is none\r\nthe less vicious, \"for this reason ... that it considers only one or two\r\npoints and neglects all the others\" (p. 548), and is directly contrary\r\nto common sense. There is never a recapitulation of total organisations,\r\nonly at the most of single organs.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Cuvier opposed and demolished the theory of\r\nthe _Echelle des etres_, not only by showing that there were in Nature\r\nfour entirely different plans of animal structure, but also by\r\ndemonstrating that even the animals of each single _Embranchement_ could\r\nnot readily be arranged in one series, that a serial arrangement was\r\nreally valid only for their separate organs. Von Baer also held that\r\nthere are four distinct types of structure; he, too, combated the idea\r\nof gradation within the limits of the type. In so far as species\r\nrepresent successive stages in the development, the _Ausbildung_, of the\r\ntype, so far can the idea of a scale of beings be applied. But the\r\nmembers of a type follow not one line of evolution but several diverging\r\nlines, in direct adaptation to different environmental conditions, so\r\nthat a serial arrangement of them is not as a rule possible. It may be\r\npossible to establish a serial arrangement of single organs from the\r\nsimplest to the most complex. But each organ or organ-system will\r\nrequire a different serial arrangement, for the different systems vary\r\non different lines and an animal may be highly developed in respect of\r\none system and little developed in respect of all the others. Man, for\r\ninstance, is the highest animal only in respect of his nervous system.\r\nThe idea of the scale of beings has therefore only a very limited\r\napplication even within the limits of the type. Applied to the whole\r\nanimal kingdom it becomes merely absurd.\r\n\r\nAnother point of resemblance between Cuvier and von Baer was that\r\nCuvier, though essentially a student of adult structure, did recognise\r\nthe importance of embryology; following up some observations of\r\nDutrochet he studied the foetal membrane of mammals and tried to\r\nestablish their homologies.[180] And in his criticism of the vertebral\r\ntheory of the skull he advanced as an argument against the\r\nbasisphenoid being a vertebral centrum the fact (established\r\nby Kerkring, 1670), that it develops from two centres.[181] Von Baer's\r\nrelation to transcendental anatomy was in some ways a close one, though\r\nhe was a trenchant critic of the extreme views of the school.[182] He took\r\nfrom Oken the idea that a simple fundamental plan rules the organisation\r\nof all Vertebrates; \"That jaws and limbs are modifications of one\r\nfundamental form is readily apparent, and, after Oken, the fact ought to\r\nbe accepted by the majority of those naturalists who do not refuse to\r\nadmit the existence of a general type from which the diversity of\r\nstructure is developed\" (i., p. 192). He accepted the vertebral theory\r\nof the skull in its main lines, and used his embryological knowledge to\r\nsupport the idea that jaws correspond to limbs--the latter point as part\r\nof the transcendental idea that the hind end of the body repeats the\r\norganisation of the anterior part (i., p. 192). The particular form\r\nwhich his theory of the relation of jaws to limbs took is shown in the\r\nfollowing passage:--\"The maxillary bone has ... the significance of an\r\nextremity and at the same time that of a rib or lower arch of a\r\nvertebra, just as the pelvic bones unite in themselves the signification\r\nof ribs and proximal members of the hinder extremity\" (Meckel's\r\n_Archiv_, p. 367, 1826).\r\n\r\nHe appreciated the morphological idea of the serial repetition of parts,\r\nand gave it accurate formulation. The whole vertebrate body, he\r\nconsidered, was composed of a longitudinal series of _morphological\r\nelements_, each of which was made up a section from each of the\r\nfundamental organs--a vertebra, a section of the nerve-cord, and so on\r\n(_Entwickelungsgeschichte_, ii., p. 53). Groups of these morphological\r\nelements formed _morphological divisions_, such as the vertebral\r\nsegments of the head with their highly developed neural arches, or the\r\nsegments of the neck with their undeveloped haemal arches. The\r\nmorphological elements are clearly shown only in the animal parts, but\r\nthere are indications in the embryo of a segmentation also of the\r\nvegetative parts,--the gill-slits, for instance, and the vascular\r\narches. The vegetative parts, however, develop on the whole\r\nunsymmetrically (_cf._ Bichat). These elements which von Baer\r\ndistinguishes are morphological units, as he himself points out,\r\ncontrasting them with organs which are not usually units in a\r\nmorphological sense. \"We call organ,\" he writes, \"each part that has by\r\nreason of its form or its function a certain distinctiveness, but this\r\nconcept is very indefinite, and possesses, from a morphological point of\r\nview, little value. For this reason it seems necessary to introduce into\r\nscientific morphology the concepts of morphological elements and\r\ndivisions\" (ii., p. 84).\r\n\r\nVon Baer exercised a very considerable influence upon the subsequent\r\ntrend of morphological theory. By his criticism of the Meckel-Serres\r\ntheory, he rid morphology for a time of an idea which was leading it\r\nastray; by his substitution of the law that development is always from\r\nthe general to the special, he set morphologists looking for the\r\narchetype in the embryo, not in the adult alone, and made them realise\r\nthat homologies could often best be sought in the earliest stages of\r\ndevelopment; by formulating the germ-layer theory he supplied\r\nmorphologists with a new criterion of homology, based upon the special\r\nrelations of the parts (germ-layers) which are first differentiated in\r\nall development. He made the study of development an essential part of\r\nmorphology.\r\n\r\n    [166] _De generatione Animalium_.\r\n\r\n    [167] _De formato foetu_, ? 1600; _De formatione\r\n    foetus_, 1604.\r\n\r\n    [168] _Exercitationes de generatione animalium_, 1651.\r\n\r\n    [169] _De formatione pulli in ovo_, 1673; _De ovo\r\n    incubato_, 1686.\r\n\r\n    [170] _De formatione pulli in ovo_, 1757-8; _Sur la\r\n    formation du coeur dans le poulet_, 1758.\r\n\r\n    [171] _Theoria generatioinis_, 1759; _De formatione\r\n    intestinorum_, 1768-9.\r\n\r\n    [172] _Beitraege zur Entwickelung des Huehnchens im Ei._\r\n    Wuerzburg, 1818.

K. E.\r\nvon Baer's _Entwickelungsgeschichte_ was by far the greatest product of\r\nthis time, but it stands in a measure apart; we have in this chapter to\r\nconsider the lesser men who were Baer's contemporaries, friends,\r\nfollowers or critics.\r\n\r\nIt was largely a German science, this new embryology, and its leaders\r\nwere all personally acquainted. Pander, von Baer and Rathke were on\r\nfriendly terms with one another; von Baer dedicated his master-work to\r\nPander; Rathke dedicated the second volume of his _Abhandlungen_ to von\r\nBaer. Interest in the new science was, however, not confined to Germany.\r\nIn Italy, Rusconi commenced in 1817 his pioneer researches on the\r\ndevelopment of the Amphibia with a _Descrizione anatomica degli organi\r\ndella circolazione delle larve delle Salamandre aquatiche_ (Pavia), in\r\nwhich he traced the metamorphoses of the aortic arches. This was\r\nfollowed in 1822 by his _Amours des Salamandres aquatiques_ (Milan), and\r\nin 1826 by his memoir _Du developpement de la grenouille_ (Milan). In\r\nthis last paper he described how the dark upper hemisphere of the frog's\r\negg grows down over the lower white hemisphere and leaves free only the\r\nyolk plug; he observed the segmentation cavity and the archenteron, but\r\nthought that the former became the alimentary canal; he observed and\r\ninterpreted rightly the formation of the medullary folds. The circular\r\nblastopore in the frog in later years often went by the name of the anus\r\nof Rusconi.\r\n\r\nIn France Dutrochet[183] investigated the foetal membranes in various\r\nvertebrate classes; Prevost and Dumas studied the very earliest stages\r\nof development in birds, mammals and amphibia (_Ann. Sci. nat._, ii.,\r\niii., 1824, xii., 1827).\r\n\r\nA little later came Duges' studies of the osteology and myology of\r\ndeveloping amphibia (1834),[184] and Coste's careful researches into the\r\nearly developmental history of mammals.[185]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Gill-slits of the Pig Embryo. (After Rathke.)]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1825 that Heinrich Rathke (1793-1860), published his famous\r\ndiscovery of gill-slits in the embryo of a mammal,[186] a discovery which\r\naroused considerable interest, and greatly stimulated embryological\r\nresearch. He describes how in a young embryo of a pig he saw four slits\r\nin the region of the neck, going right through into the oesophagus. They\r\nwere separated by partitions which he called _Kiemenbogen_\r\n(gill-arches), and immediately in front of the first gill-slit lay the\r\ndeveloping lower jaw. He compared these gill-slits with those of a\r\ndogfish. We reproduce his drawing of the pig-embryo (_Isis_, Pl. IV.,\r\nfig. 1).\r\n\r\nLater in the same year Rathke discovered gill-slits in the chick,[187] in\r\nthis case finding only three. He described growing out from in front of\r\nthe first slit a structure which he compared to the operculum or\r\ngill-cover of a fish.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries were confirmed and extended for the chick[188] by the\r\nembryologist Huschke, a pupil of Oken. Like Rathke, he found only three\r\nindubitable gill-slits, but he noticed that the body-wall in front of\r\nthe first gill-slit was really composed of two arches, which were on the\r\nwhole similar to the gill-arches. The hinder of these two seemed to him\r\nto be a horn of the hyoid, the front one, which was bent at an angle, to\r\nbe the rudiment of the upper and lower jaws (p. 401). Between these two\r\narches he found an opening, just as between two gill-arches a gill-slit.\r\nThis opening led into the mouth-cavity, and according to Huschke it\r\nbecame the external ear-passage. He discovered also three pairs of\r\naortic arches in close relation with the gill-arches, so close indeed,\r\nthat he did not hesitate to call them gill-arteries, and to recognise\r\ntheir resemblance with the aortic arches of fish. He traced, in part at\r\nleast, the metamorphosis which these aortic arches undergo. This part of\r\nhis discovery he developed in fuller detail in a paper of 1828,[189] in\r\nwhich he gave some excellent figures.\r\n\r\nShortly after Huschke's first paper, von Baer published his views and\r\nobservations on this subject in a short memoir in Meckel's _Archiv_.[190]\r\nIn this paper he confirmed Rathke's discovery, and described the slits\r\nand arches in the dog and the chick. Both Rathke and he found gill-slits\r\nin the human embryo about this time (p. 557). There were generally\r\npresent, he found, four gill-slits, and, as Rathke had suggested, the\r\nfirst gill-arch became the lower jaw. Von Baer also confirmed Rathke's\r\ndiscovery of the operculum, assigning it, however, to the second\r\ngill-arch. He refused to accept Huschke's derivation of the auditory\r\nmeatus from the first gill-slit. Von Baer saw what had escaped Rathke\r\nand Huschke, that there were, not three nor four, but as many as five\r\naortic arches.\r\n\r\nIn his view of the metamorphosis of the aortic arches in the chick the\r\nfirst two pairs disappeared completely, the third pair gave rise to the\r\narteries of the head and the fore-limbs, the right side of the fourth\r\narch became the aorta, the left half of the fourth and the right half of\r\nthe fifth arch became the pulmonary arteries, while the left half of the\r\nfifth arch disappeared. This schema, which for the last three arches was\r\nthe same as Huschke's, von Baer upheld for the chick even in the second\r\nvolume of his _Entwickelungsgeschichte_ (p. 116); he rectified it,\r\nhowever, for mammals in the same volume (p. 212), deriving both\r\npulmonary arteries from the fifth arch, and the aorta from the fourth\r\nleft. He fully recognised the great analogy of the embryonic arrangement\r\nof gill-arches and gill-arteries in Tetrapoda with their arrangement in\r\nfish (i., pp. 53, 73).\r\n\r\nHuschke, in a paper of 1832,[191] chiefly devoted to the development of\r\nthe eye, figured and described the developing upper and lower jaws, and\r\nmaintained against von Baer that the first slit turns into the auditory\r\nmeatus and the Eustachian tube.\r\n\r\nThese were the first papers of the embryological period. Before going on\r\nto discuss the principles which guided embryological research during the\r\nnext ten or twenty years it is convenient to note what were the main\r\nlines of work characterising the period.\r\n\r\nThe typical figure of the period is Rathke, who produced a great deal of\r\nfirst-class embryological work. He was, even more than von Baer, a\r\ncomparative embryologist, and there were few groups of animals that he\r\ndid not study. His first large publication, the _Beitraege zur Geschichte\r\nder Thierwelt_ (i.-iv., Halle, 1820-27), contained much anatomical work\r\nin addition to the purely embryological; he commenced here his series of\r\npapers on the development of the genital and urinary organs, continued\r\nin the _Abhandlungen zur Bildungsund Entwickelungs-Geschichte des\r\nMenschen und der Thiere_ (i., ii., Leipzig, 1832-3). A fellow-worker in\r\nthis line was Johannes Mueller, whose _Bildungsgeschichte der Genitalien_\r\n(Duesseldorf) appeared in 1830.\r\n\r\nIn a memoir on the development of the crayfish which appeared in\r\n1829,[192] Rathke found in an Invertebrate confirmation of the germ-layer\r\ntheory propounded by Pander and von Baer. He was greatly struck by the\r\ninverted position of the embryo with respect to the yolk. In following\r\nout the development of the appendages he noticed how much alike were\r\njaws and legs in their earliest stage, and how this supported Savigny's\r\ncontention that the limbs of Arthropods belonged to one single type of\r\nstructure. In his paper (1832) on the development of the fresh-water\r\nIsopod, _Asellus_,[193] Rathke returns to this point. Commenting on the\r\noriginal similarity in development of antennae, jaws and legs, he writes,\r\n\"Whatever the doubts one may have reserved as to the intimate relation\r\nexisting between the jaws and feet of articulate animals after the\r\nresearches of Savigny on this subject and mine on developing crayfish,\r\nthey must all fall to the ground when one examines with care the\r\ndevelopment of the fresh-water Asellus\" (p. 147 of French translation).\r\n\r\nFurther comparative work by Rathke is found in the two volumes of\r\n_Abhandlungen_ and in a book, _Zur Morphologie, Reisebemerkungen aus\r\nTaurien_ (1837), which contains embryological studies of many different\r\ntypes, including a study of the uniform plan of arthropod limbs. Later\r\non Rathke devoted himself more to vertebrate embryology, producing among\r\nother works his classical papers on the development of the adder (1839),\r\nof the tortoise (1848), and of the crocodile (1866). He laid the\r\nfoundations of all subsequent knowledge of the development of the\r\nblood-vascular system in a series of papers of various dates from 1838\r\nto 1856. The diagrams in his paper on the aortic arches of reptiles\r\n(1856) were for long copied in every text-book.\r\n\r\nRathke was a foremost worker in another important line of embryological\r\nwork, the study of the development of the skeleton and particularly of\r\nthe skull. We shall discuss the history of the embryological study of\r\nthe skull in some detail below; meantime, we note the two other\r\nimportant lines of research which characterise this period. One is the\r\nintensive study of the development of the human embryo, a study pursued\r\nby, among others, Pockels, Seiler, Breschet, Velpeau, Bischoff, Weber,\r\nMueller, and Wharton Jones.[194] The other important line--the early\r\ndevelopment of the Mammalia--was worked chiefly by Valentin,[195]\r\nCoste,[196] and, above all, by Bischoff, whose series of papers[197] was\r\njustly recognised as classical.\r\n\r\nWhat interests us chiefly in the work of this embryological period is,\r\nof course, the relation of embryology to comparative anatomy and to pure\r\nmorphology. The embryologists were not slow to see that their work threw\r\nmuch light upon questions of homology, and upon the problem of the unity\r\nof plan. Von Baer, we have seen, recognised this clearly in 1828;\r\nRathke, in one of his most brilliant papers, the\r\n_Anatomisch-philosophische Untersuchungen ueber den Kiemenapparat und das\r\nZungenbein_ (Riga and Dorpat, 1832), used the facts of development with\r\ngreat effect to show the homology of the gill-arches and hyoid\r\nthroughout the vertebrate series; Johannes Mueller made great use of\r\nembryology in his classical _Vergleichende Anatomie der Myxinoiden_ (i.\r\nTheil, 1836), and, according to his pupil Reichert, firmly held the\r\nopinion that embryology was the final court of appeal in disputed points\r\nof comparative anatomy;[198] Reichert himself in a book of 1838\r\n(_Vergleichende Entwickelungsgeschichte des Kopfes der nackten\r\nAmphibien_) discussed the two different methods of arriving at the\r\n\"Type\"--the anatomical method of comparing adults, and the embryological\r\nmethod of comparing embryogenies. Of the embryological method, he says,\r\n\"Its aim is to distinguish during the formation of the organism the\r\noriginally given, the essence of the type, and to classify and interpret\r\nwhat is added or altered in the further course of development.\r\nEmbryologists watch the gradual building up of the organism from its\r\nfoundations, and distinguish the fundament, the primordial form, the\r\ntype, from the individual developments; they reach thus, following\r\nNature in a certain measure, the essential structure of the organism,\r\nand demonstrate the laws that manifest themselves during embryogeny\" (p.\r\nvi.). The embryologists, influenced in this greatly by von Baer,\r\ngradually felt their way to substituting for the \"Archetype\" of pure\r\nmorphology what one may perhaps best call the _embryological archetype_.\r\nHow the transition was made we can best see by following out the course\r\nof discovery in one particular line. We choose for this purpose the\r\ndevelopment of the skull, a subject which excited much interest at this\r\ntime and upon which much quite fundamental work was done, particularly\r\nby Rathke and Reichert.\r\n\r\nFollowing up his discovery of gill-slits and arches in the embryos of\r\nbirds and mammals, Rathke in two papers of 1832[199] and 1833[200] worked\r\nout the detailed homologies of the gill-arches in the higher\r\nVertebrates. He describes how in the embryo of the Blenny there is a\r\nshort, thick arch between the first gill-slit and the mouth. A furrow\r\nappears down the middle of the arch dividing it incompletely into two.\r\nIn the anterior halves a cartilaginous rod is developed which is\r\nconnected with the skull; these rods become on either side the lower jaw\r\nand \"quadrate.\" In the posterior halves two similar rods are formed\r\nwhich develop into the hyoid. The hyoid is at first connected with the\r\nskull, but afterwards frees itself and becomes slung to the \"quadrate.\"\r\nFrom the hinder edge of the hyoid arch grows out the membranous\r\noperculum, in which develop later the opercular bones and branchiostegal\r\nrays. The upper jaw is an independent outgrowth of the serous layer.\r\n\r\nThe serial homology of the lower jaw and quadrate with the hyoid and\r\nwith the true gill-arches was thus established in fish, and Rathke had\r\nlittle difficulty in demonstrating a similar origin of lower jaw and\r\nhyoid in the embryos of higher Vertebrates. He could even, as we have\r\nnoted before, find the homologue of the operculum in a flap which grows\r\nout from the hyoid arch in the embryo of birds.\r\n\r\nBut Rathke could not altogether shake himself free from the\r\ntranscendental notion of the homology of jaws with ribs, and this led\r\nhim to draw a certain distinction between the first two and the\r\nremaining gill-arches, by which the homology of the former with the ribs\r\nwas asserted and the homology of the latter denied. He thought he could\r\nshow that the skeletal structures (lower jaw, \"quadrate,\" and hyoid) of\r\nthe first two arches were formed in the serous layer, just like true\r\nribs, and like them in close connection with the vertebral skeletal\r\naxis. The other, \"true,\" gill-arches appeared to him to be formed in the\r\nmucous layer, in the lining of the alimentary canal. They had no direct\r\nconnection with the vertebral column, and seemed therefore to belong to\r\nwhat Carus[201] had called the visceral or splanchno-skeleton. He did not,\r\nhowever, let this distinction hinder him from asserting the substantial\r\nhomology of all the gill-arches _inter se_, the first two included.\r\n\r\nRathke's discoveries relative to the development of the jaws, the hyoid\r\nand the operculum, enabled him to make short work of the homologies\r\nproposed for them by the transcendentalists. He could prove from\r\nembryology that the jaws were not the equivalent of limbs, as so many\r\nOkenians believed. He could reject, with a mere reference to the facts\r\nof development, Geoffroy's comparison of the hyoid and the\r\nbranchiostegal rays in fish with sternum and ribs. He could show the\r\nemptiness of the attempts made by Carus, Treviranus, de Blainville and\r\nGeoffroy, to establish by anatomical comparison the homologies of the\r\nopercular bones, for he could show that these bones were peculiar to\r\nfish, and were scarcely indicated, and that only temporarily, in the\r\ndevelopment of other Vertebrates.[202] He did not, however, himself\r\nrealise the relation of the ear-ossicles to the gill-arches, though he\r\nknew that Spix and Geoffroy were quite wrong in homologising them with\r\nthe opercular bones in fish. He described, it is true, the development\r\nof the external meatus of the ear and the Eustachian tube from the slit\r\nwhich appears between the first and the second arch, as Huschke had done\r\nbefore him; he described, in confirmation of Meckel, the \"Meckelian\r\nprocess\" of the hammer running down inside the lower jaw; but the\r\ndiscovery of the true homologies of the ear-ossicles was not made until\r\na year or two later by Reichert.\r\n\r\nIn his further study of the development of _Blennius viviparus_, Rathke\r\nobserved some important facts about the development of the vertebral\r\ncolumn and skull. He found that the vertebral centra were first formed\r\nas rings in the chorda-sheath, which give off neural and haemal\r\nprocesses. The vertebra later ossifies from four centres. The chorda\r\n(notochord) is prolonged some little way into the head, and the base of\r\nthe cranium is formed by the expanded sheath, which reaches forward in\r\nfront of the end of the notochord. This cranial basis shows a division\r\ninto three segments, in which Rathke was inclined to see an indication\r\nof three cranial vertebrae. (It turned out that this division into three\r\nsegments did not really exist, and Rathke later acknowledged that he had\r\nmade an error of observation.) The side walls of the skull grow out from\r\nthis base and form a fibrous capsule for the brain. The cranial section\r\nof the chorda itself shows no sign of segmentation; but later on the\r\ncranial portion of the chorda-sheath ossifies, like the vertebrae, from\r\nseveral centres. The vomer, which, in the classical form of the\r\nvertebral theory of the skull, was the centrum of the fourth, or\r\nforemost, cranial vertebra, does not, according to Rathke, develop in\r\ncontinuity with the cranial basis and the chorda sheath, but develops\r\nseparately in the facial region.\r\n\r\nVon Baer, like Rathke at this time, was also to some extent a believer\r\nin the vertebral theory of the skull. In his second volume (1834, pub.\r\n1837) he holds that the development of the skull, as the sum of the\r\nanterior vertebral arches, is in general the same as that of the other\r\nneural arches, and is modified only by the great bulk of the brain\r\n(_Entwickelungsgeschichte_, ii., p. 99). He had, however, some doubts as\r\nto the entire correctness of the vertebral theory, doubts suggested by a\r\nstudy of the developing skull. \"In the course of the formation of the\r\nhead in the higher animals, something additional is introduced which\r\ndoes not originally belong to the cranial vertebrae. At first we see the\r\nvertebration in the hinder region of the skull very clearly. Afterwards\r\nit becomes suddenly indistinct, as if some new formation overlaid it\"\r\n(i., p. 194).\r\n\r\nEven more clearly is his doubt expressed in his paper on _Cyprinus_.\r\n\"Upon the formation of the vertebral column only this need be said, that\r\nat this stage the notochord is very clearly seen, and the upper and\r\nlower arches and spinous processes are visible right to the end of the\r\ntail, but the separation into vertebrae ceases abruptly where the back\r\npasses into the head. I do not hesitate to assert _that bony fish, too,\r\nhave at this stage an unsegmented cartilaginous cranium_ (as\r\ncartilaginous fish have all their life), the prominences and hollows of\r\nwhich constitute its only resemblance with the vertebral type\" (1835, p.\r\n19).\r\n\r\nA convinced supporter of the vertebral theory was Johannes Mueller, who,\r\nin his classical memoir on the Myxinoids,[203] discussed at some length\r\nthe relation between the development of the vertebrae and the development\r\nof the skull. His memoir is principally devoted to comparative anatomy,\r\nbut in treating of the skeleton he pays much attention to development.\r\nHe describes the formation of the vertebrae in elasmobranch embryos; for\r\nthe facts regarding other Vertebrates he relies largely on work by\r\nRathke (_Blennius_, 1833) and Duges (1834). He recognises as the basis\r\nof his comparisons the homology of the notochord in all vertebrate\r\nembryos with the persistent notochord which forms the chief part or the\r\nwhole of the vertebral column in the Cyclostomes. The notochord\r\npossesses an inner and an outer sheath and the outer sheath is\r\ncontinuous with the _basis cranii_ (p. 92). It is in the outer sheath\r\nthat the vertebrae develop--from four separate pieces, in fish at least,\r\nplus an additional element which helps to form the centrum. The skull of\r\nVertebrates consists, according to Mueller, of three vertebrae, whose\r\ncentra are the basioccipital, the basisphenoid and the presphenoid.\r\nOther bones besides those belonging to the vertebrae are present, but\r\nthis formation out of three vertebrae gives the essential schema for the\r\nskull. Now the brain capsule, like the sheath of the spinal cord, is a\r\ndevelopment from the outer sheath of the notochord. If the skull\r\nconsists of vertebrae we should expect the centra of the skull-vertebrae\r\nto develop in the outer sheath at the sides of the cranial section of\r\nthe notochord as two separate halves, just as do the bodies of the\r\nvertebrae; we should expect further the cartilaginous side-walls of the\r\ncranium to develop in the membranous brain-sheath just as the neural\r\narches develop in the membranous sheath of the spinal column. In\r\nRathke's discovery (!) of a segmentation of the _basis cranii_ into\r\nthree parts, and of the isolated formation of the vomer, Mueller sees a\r\nconfirmation of his view that the skull is composed of three and not\r\nfour vertebrae. But there is nothing in Rathke's observations to support\r\nthe idea that the centra of the cranial vertebrae are formed from\r\nseparate halves. Mueller has to be content with a reference to the state\r\nof things in _Ammocoetes_ (which, by the way, he did not know to be the\r\nyoung of _Petromyzon_). In the simple skull of _Ammocoetes_ the base is\r\nformed chiefly by two cartilaginous bars lying more or less parallel\r\nwith the longitudinal axis of the skull and embracing with their hinder\r\nends the cranial portion of the notochord.\r\n\r\nThese bars, declares Mueller, are clearly the still separate halves of\r\nthe _pars basilaris cranii_, and represent the divided centra of the two\r\nhinder cranial vertebrae. To complete the parallel between the\r\ndevelopment of the skull and of the vertebrae, it would have been\r\nnecessary to show that the side walls of the cranium developed in a\r\nsimilar manner from separate pieces. Mueller could not prove this point\r\nfrom the available embryological data, and indeed the facts which he did\r\nuse had to be twisted to suit his theory. A curious apparent\r\nconfirmation of his idea that the centra of the cranial vertebrae are\r\nformed from separate halves was supplied in 1839 by Rathke's discovery\r\nof the trabeculae in the embryonic skull of the adder.\r\n\r\nThe next big step in the study of the development of the skull was\r\ntaken by a pupil of Mueller, C. B. Reichert, who showed in his work\r\nvery distinct traces of his master's influence. Reichert's first and\r\nmost important contribution to the subject was his paper on the\r\nmetamorphosis of the gill, or, as he called them, the visceral arches\r\nin Vertebrates,[204] particularly in the two higher classes. Reichert\r\ndescribes the similar origin in embryo of bird and mammal (pig) of\r\nthree \"visceral\" arches. These arches stand in close relation to the\r\nthree cranial vertebrae which Reichert, like Mueller, distinguishes. He\r\nmakes the retrograde step of admitting only three aortic arches, and\r\nhe is not inclined to consider the three visceral arches as equivalent\r\nto the gill-arches of fish--in his opinion they have more analogy with\r\nribs, though differing somewhat from ribs in their later\r\nmodifications. The visceral arches are processes of the visceral\r\nplates (von Baer), which grow downwards and meet in the middle line,\r\nleaving between one another and the undivided body wall three visceral\r\nslits opening into the pharynx. The first visceral process is\r\ndifferent in shape from the others, for it sends forward, parallel\r\nwith the head and at right angles to its downward portion, an upper\r\nportion in which later the upper jaw is formed. The other two\r\nprocesses are straight. From the hinder edge of the second visceral\r\narch there develops, as Rathke had seen, a fold which is comparable\r\nwith the operculum of fish. The first slit develops externally into\r\nthe ear-passage, internally into the Eustachian tube, and in the\r\nmiddle a partition forms the tympanic ring and tympanum. Inside each\r\nof the visceral processes on either side a cartilaginous rod develops.\r\nIn the first process this rod shows three segments, of which the first\r\nlies inside that portion of the process which is parallel with the\r\nhead. This upper segment forms the foundation for the bones of the\r\nupper jaw. The lowest segment of the cartilaginous rod becomes\r\nMeckel's cartilage, and on the outer side of this the bones of the\r\nlower jaw are formed. The middle segment becomes in mammals the incus\r\n(one of the ear-ossicles), and in birds the quadrate. Meckel's\r\ncartilage, which was discovered by Meckel[205] in fish, amphibians and\r\nbirds, is a long strip of cartilage which runs from the ear-ossicle\r\nknown as the hammer in mammals,[206] to the inside of the mandible.\r\nReichert shows how this relation comes about. The hammer, according to\r\nhis observations on the embryo of the pig, is simply the proximal end\r\nof Meckel's cartilage, which later becomes separated off from the long\r\ndistal portion (see Fig. 9). The third ear-ossicle of mammals, the\r\nstapes, comes not from the first arch but from the second. The\r\ncartilaginous rod of the second arch segments like the first into\r\nthree pieces. Of these the uppermost disappears, the middle one, which\r\nlies close up to the labyrinth of the ear, becomes the stapes, and the\r\nlowest becomes the anterior horn of the hyoid. The stapes forms a\r\nclose connection with the hammer and the incus. In birds, where there\r\nis a single ear-ossicle, the columella, the middle piece of arch I\r\nforms, as we have seen, the quadrate, by means of which the lower jaw\r\nis joined to the skull. The proximal end of Meckel's cartilage, which\r\nin mammals forms the hammer, here gives the articular surface between\r\nthe lower jaw and the quadrate. The columella is formed from the\r\nmiddle piece of the three into which the cartilage of the second arch\r\nsegments. It is, therefore, the homologue of the stapes in mammals.\r\nThe third arch takes a varying share, together with the second, in the\r\nformation of the hyoid apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Meckel's Cartilage and Ear-ossicles in Embryo\r\nof Pig. (After Reichert.)]\r\n\r\nIn this paper Reichert made a distinct advance on the previous workers\r\nin the same field--Rathke, Huschke, von Baer, Martin St Ange, Duges.\r\nHuschke was indeed the first to suggest that both upper and lower jaws\r\nwere formed in the first gill-arch. But both von Baer and Rathke[207] held\r\nthat the upper jaw developed as a special process independent of the\r\nlower jaw rudiment, and the actual proof that the upper jaw is a\r\nderivative of the first visceral arch seems to have been first supplied\r\nby Reichert. His brilliant work on the development of the ear-ossicles\r\nfounded what we may justly call the classical theory of their\r\nhomologies. His views were attacked and in some points rectified, but\r\nthe main homologies he established are even now accepted by many,\r\nperhaps the majority of morphologists.\r\n\r\nIn a paper of 1838 on the comparative embryology of the skull in\r\nAmphibia,[208] Reichert added to his results for mammals and birds an\r\naccount of the fate of the first and second visceral arches in Anura and\r\nUrodela.\r\n\r\nThe first visceral arch, he found, gave in Amphibia practically the same\r\nstructures as in the higher Vertebrates. Its skeleton segmented, as in\r\nmammals and birds, into three parts; the upper part gave rise to the\r\npalatine and pterygoid in Anura, but seemed to disappear in Urodeles,\r\nwhere the so-called palatine and pterygoid developed in the mucous\r\nmembrane of the mouth; the middle part gave, as in birds, the quadrate,\r\nwhich formed a suspensorium for both arches; the lower part, as Meckel's\r\ncartilage, formed a foundation for the bones of the lower jaw. Of arch\r\nII., the lower part became the horn of the hyoid, the upper part had a\r\nvarying fate. In some Anura it formed the ossicle of the ear (homologue\r\nof the columella of birds and the stapes of mammals), in others it\r\ndisappeared. In reptiles the upper segment of the second arch formed, as\r\nin birds, the columella.\r\n\r\nThe account of the metamorphoses of the visceral arches in Amphibia\r\nforms only a small part of Reichert's memoir of 1838, the chief object\r\nof which was to discover the general \"typus\" of the vertebrate skull,\r\nand to follow out its modifications in the different classes. Von Baer\r\nhad shown that the generalised type appeared most clearly in the early\r\nembryo; Reichert therefore sought the archetype of the skull in the\r\ndeveloping embryo. He brought to his task the preconceived notion that\r\nthe skull could be reduced to an assemblage of vertebrae, but he saw that\r\ncomparative anatomy alone could not effect this reduction; he had\r\nrecourse, therefore, to embryology, hoping to find in the simplified\r\nstructure of the embryo clear indications of three primitive cranial\r\nvertebrae (p. 121, 1837).\r\n\r\nIn the head he distinguished two tubes, the upper formed by the dorsal\r\nplates, the lower by the ventral or visceral plates. Both of these tubes\r\nwere derived from the serous or animal layer (_cf._ von Baer, _supra_,\r\np. 118). The walls of the lower tube were formed by the visceral\r\nprocesses, within which later the skeleton of the visceral arches\r\ndeveloped. The walls of the upper tube formed the bones and muscles of\r\nthe cranium proper. The facial part of the head was formed by elements\r\nfrom both upper and lower tubes. The dorsal tube showed signs of a\r\ndivision into three cranial vertebrae (_Urwirbeln_, primitive vertebrae).\r\nIn mammals and birds, as Reichert had shown in his 1837 paper, the three\r\ncranial vertebrae were indicated by transverse furrows on the ventral\r\nsurface of the still membranous skull (see Fig. 10, p. 148).\r\n\r\nEven in mammals and birds, however, the positions of the eye, the\r\near-labyrinth, and the three visceral arches were the safest guides to\r\nthe delimitation of the cranial vertebrae (pp. 134-138, 1837). In\r\nAmphibia generally there were no definite lines of separation on the\r\nskull itself. \"At this stage,\" he writes of the cartilaginous cranium of\r\nthe frog, \"we find no trace of a veritable division into vertebrae in the\r\ncartilaginous trough formed by the _basis cranii_ and the side parts. On\r\nthe contrary, it is quite continuous, as it is also in the higher\r\nVertebrates during the process of chondrification\" (p. 44, 1838). The\r\nvertebrae in the membranous or cartilaginous skull could be delimited in\r\nAmphibia by the help of the eye and the ear-labyrinth, which lie more or\r\nless between the first and second, and the second and third vertebrae,\r\nbut, above all, by the vesicles of the brain.\r\n\r\nAs in the higher Vertebrates, the visceral arches are associated with\r\nthe cranial vertebrae as their ventral extensions, being equivalent to\r\nthe visceral plates which form the ventral portion of the \"primitive\r\nvertebrae\" or primitive segments of the trunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Cranial Vertebrae and Visceral Arches in Embryo\r\nof Pig. Ventral Aspect. (After Reichert.)]\r\n\r\nIf the three cranial vertebrae are not very distinct in the early stages\r\nof development when the skull is still membranous or cartilaginous, they\r\nbecome clearly delimited when ossification sets in. Three rings of bone\r\nforming three more or less complete vertebrae are the final result of\r\nossification. The composition of these rings is as follows:--\r\n\r\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                |   Base.       |    Sides.       |  Top.          |\r\n|----------------+---------------+-----------------+----------------|\r\n|First vertebra  |Presphenoid    |Orbitosphenoids  |Frontals        |\r\n|                |               |                 |                |\r\n|Second vertebra |Basisphenoid   |Alisphenoids     |Parietals       |\r\n|                |               |                 |                |\r\n|Third vertebra  |Basioccipital  |Exoccipitals     |Supraoccipital  |\r\n+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe other bones of the skull are not included in the vertebrae, and this\r\nis in large part due to the fact that the sense capsules are formed\r\nseparately from the cranium (p. 29, 1838). The ear-labyrinth, it is\r\ntrue, fuses indissolubly with the cranium at a later period, but the\r\nbones which develop in its capsule are not for all that integral parts\r\nof the primitive cranial vertebrae. This point, it is interesting to\r\nnote, had already been made by Oken in his _Programm_ (1807). But many\r\nof the bones developed in relation to the sense organs can find their\r\nplace in the generalised embryonic schema or archetype of the vertebrate\r\nskull, for they are of very constant occurrence during early\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at a generalised embryonic type for the vertebrate skull,\r\nof which the fundamental elements are the three cranial vertebrae and\r\ntheir arches, Reichert goes on to discuss the particular forms under\r\nwhich the skull appears in adult Vertebrates. He accepts in general von\r\nBaer's law that the characters of the large groups appear earlier in\r\nembryogeny than the characters of the lesser classificatory divisions.\r\n\"When we observe new and not originally present rudiments in very early\r\nembryonic stages, as, for instance, that for the lacrymals, the\r\nprobability is that they belong to the distinctive development of one of\r\nthe _larger_ vertebrate groups. From these are to be carefully\r\ndistinguished such rudiments as arise later during ossification, mostly\r\nas _ossa intercalaria_, in order to give greater strength to the skull\r\nin view of the greater development of the brain, etc.; the latter give\r\ntheir individual character to the _smaller_ vertebrate groups, and\r\ncomprise such bones as the _vomer_, the _Wormian bones_, the lowermost\r\nturbinal, etc.\" (p. 63, 1838).\r\n\r\nHe did not accept the Meckel-Serres law of parallelism. He recognised\r\nthe great similarity between the unsegmented cartilaginous cranium of\r\nElasmobranchs, and the primordial cranium of the embryos of the higher\r\nVertebrates, but he did not think that the cranium of Elasmobranchs was\r\nsimply an undeveloped or embryonic stage of the skulls of the higher\r\nforms. Rather \"do the _Holocephala_, _Plagiostomata_, and _Cyclostomata_\r\nappear to us to be lower developmental stages individually\r\ndifferentiated, so that the other fully differentiated Vertebrates\r\ncannot easily be referred directly to their type\" (p. 152, 1838). The\r\nskull of these lower fishes is itself a specialised one; it is an\r\nindividualised modification of a simple type of skull. And this holds\r\ngood in general of the skulls of the lower Vertebrates--they are\r\nindividualised exemplars of a simple general type, not merely unmodified\r\nembryonic stages of the greatly differentiated skulls of the higher\r\nVertebrates (p. 250, 1838). Differentiation within the vertebrate phylum\r\nis therefore not uniserial, but takes place in several directions.\r\nReichert describes two sorts of modifications of the typical\r\nskull--class modifications and functional modifications. The causes of\r\nthe modifications which characterise classificatory groups are unknown;\r\nthe second class of modifications occur in response to adaptational\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nReichert's two papers are of considerable importance, and Mueller's\r\nremark in his review[209] of them is on the whole justified. \"These\r\npraiseworthy investigations supply from the realm of embryology new and\r\nwelcome foundations for comparative anatomy\" (p. clxxxvii.).\r\n\r\nThe development of the skull was, however, more thoroughly worked out by\r\nRathke, and with less theoretical bias, in his classical paper on the\r\nadder.[210] This memoir of Rathke's is an exhaustive one and deals with\r\nthe development of all the principal organ-systems, but particularly of\r\nthe skeletal and vascular. He confirmed in its essentials Reichert's\r\naccount of the metamorphoses of the first two visceral arches,\r\ndescribing how the rudiment of the skeleton of the first arch appears as\r\na forked process of the cranial basis, the upper prong developing into\r\nthe palatine and pterygoid, the lower forming Meckel's cartilage, while\r\nthe quadrate develops from the angle of the fork. The actual bone of the\r\nupper jaw (maxillary) develops outside and separate from the\r\npalato-pterygoid bar. The cartilaginous rod supporting the second\r\nvisceral arch divides into three pieces on each side, of which the lower\r\ntwo form the hyoid, the uppermost the columella. Like Reichert he held\r\nthe visceral arches to be parts of the visceral plates, containing,\r\nhowever, elements from all three germ-layers--the serous, mucous, and\r\nvessel layers.\r\n\r\nThe first gill-slit, or, as Rathke here prefers to call it, pharyngeal\r\nslit, closes completely in snakes and in Urodeles. It forms the\r\nEustachian tube in all other Tetrapoda. As regards the vertebrae, Rathke\r\ndescribes them as being formed in the sheath of the chorda from paired\r\nrudiments, each of which sends two branches upwards, and two branches\r\ndownwards. The two inner pairs of processes coalesce round the chorda,\r\nand later form the centrum; the upper outer pair meet above the spinal\r\ncolumn; the lower outer pair form ribs. The odontoid process of the axis\r\nvertebra is the centrum of the atlas (p. 120). The formation of\r\nvertebral rudiments begins close behind the ear-labyrinth, but in front\r\nof this the chorda-sheath gives origin to a flat membranous plate which\r\nafterwards becomes cartilaginous. This plate reaches forward below the\r\nthird cerebral vesicle as far as the infundibulum. The notochord ends in\r\nthis plate, which is the _basis cranii_, just at the level of the\r\near-labyrinth. In no Vertebrate does the notochord extend farther\r\nforward (p. 122). The _basis cranii_ gives off three trabeculae. The\r\nmiddle one is small and sticks up behind the infundibulum; it is absent\r\nin fish and Amphibia, and soon disappears during the development of the\r\nhigher forms. The lateral trabeculae are long bars which curve round the\r\ninfundibulum and reach nearly to the front end of the head. Together\r\nthey are lyre-shaped. The cranial basis and the trabeculae are formed,\r\nlike the vertebrae, in the sheath of the notochord, and the only\r\ndifferences between the two in the early stage of their development are\r\nthat the formative mass for the cranial basis is much greater in amount\r\nthan that for the vertebrae, and that the cranial basis by means of its\r\nprocesses, the trabeculae, reaches well in front of the terminal portion\r\nof the notochord (p. 36). The capsule for the ear-labyrinth develops\r\nquite independently of the cranial basis and the notochord. It resembles\r\non its first appearance, in form, position, composition, and\r\nconnections, the ear-capsule of Cyclostomes, and so do the ear-capsules\r\nof all embryonic Vertebrates (p. 39). It manifests clearly the embryonic\r\narchetype, ... \"there exists one single and original plan of formation,\r\nas we may suppose, upon which is built the labyrinth of Vertebrates in\r\ngeneral\" (p. 40). When ossification sets in, the ear-capsule forms three\r\nbones, of which two fuse with the supraoccipital and exoccipitals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Embryonic Cranium of the Adder. Ventral Aspect.\r\n(After Rathke.)]\r\n\r\nDuring the formation of the ear-capsule the cranial basis develops from\r\na plate to a trench, for in its hinder section the side parts grow up to\r\nform the side walls of the brain, in exactly the same way as the\r\nprocesses of the vertebral rudiments grow up to enclose the spinal\r\ncolumn (pp. 122, 192). The foundations of the skull are now complete,\r\nand ossification gradually sets in. The basioccipital is formed\r\nin the posterior part of the _basis cranii_, and the exoccipitals in the\r\nside walls of the trench in continuity with the fundament of the\r\nbasioccipital (see Fig. 11). The supraoccipital is formed in cartilage\r\nabove the exoccipitals. The basisphenoid develops, like the\r\nbasioccipital, in the flat _basis cranii_, but towards its anterior\r\nedge, between the large foramen (_h_) and the pituitary space (_i_). It\r\nis formed from two centres, each of which is originally a ring round the\r\ncarotid foramen. The presphenoid develops in isolation between the\r\nlateral trabeculae, just behind the point where they fuse. The side parts\r\nof the basisphenoid and presphenoid (forming the alisphenoids and the\r\norbitosphenoids respectively) develop in cartilage separately from the\r\ncranial basis, not like the exoccipitals in continuity with it. The\r\nhinder parts of the trabeculae become enclosed by two processes of the\r\nbasisphenoid; their front parts remain in a vestigial and cartilaginous\r\nstate alongside the presphenoid. The frontals and parietals show a\r\npeculiar mode of origin in the adder, differing from their origin in\r\nother Vertebrates. The frontals develop in continuity with the\r\norbitosphenoids, the parietals in continuity with the alisphenoids, and\r\nso have much resemblance with the vertebral neural arches which surround\r\nthe spinal column (p. 195).\r\n\r\nThrough Rathke's work the real embryonic archetype of the vertebrate\r\nskull was for the first time disclosed. Rathke discussed this archetype\r\nand its relation to the vertebral theory of the skull in another paper\r\nof the same year (1839), but before going on to this paper, we shall\r\nquote from the paper on the adder the following passage, remarkable for\r\nthe clear way in which the idea of the embryological archetype is\r\nexpressed. \"Whatever differences may appear in the development of\r\nVertebrates, there yet exists for the different classes and orders a\r\nuniversally valid idea (plan, schema, or type) ruling the first\r\nformation of their separate parts. This idea must first be worked out,\r\nthough possibly with modifications, before more special ideas can find\r\nplay. The result of the latter process, however, is that what was formed\r\nby the first idea is not so much hidden as partially or wholly\r\ndestroyed\" (p. 135).\r\n\r\nRathke's general paper on the development of the skull in Vertebrates[211]\r\ntreats the matter on a broader comparative basis than his paper on the\r\nadder, and takes into account all the vertebrate classes, in so far as\r\ntheir development was then known. He here makes the interesting\r\nsuggestion, later entirely confirmed, that the _basis cranii_ or basilar\r\nplate is first laid down as two strips, one on each side of the\r\nchorda--the structures now known as parachordals (pp. 6, 27). For this\r\nsupposition, he thinks, speaks the structure of the skull in\r\n_Ammocoetes_, which in this respect is the simplest of all Vertebrates\r\n(pp. 6, 22). In _Ammocoetes_, as Johannes Mueller had shown, the\r\nfoundation of the skull is formed by two long cartilaginous bars,\r\nbetween the hinder portions of which the notochord ends. In these Rathke\r\nwas inclined to see the homologues of his trabeculae, and of the\r\nparachordals which he was ready to assume from his embryological\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nMueller was, of course, very ready to accept Rathke's opinions on this\r\nsubject, for he considered that they supported his own theory of the\r\nvertebral nature of the skull. After describing in his _Handbuch der\r\nPhysiologie_ the cartilaginous bands in _Ammocoetes_ and their highly\r\ndifferentiated homologues in the Myxinoids, he writes in the later\r\neditions, \"Hence we see that in the cranium, as in the spinal column,\r\nthere are at first developed at the sides of the chorda dorsalis two\r\nsymmetrical elements, which subsequently coalesce, and may wholly\r\nenclose the chorda. Rathke has recently observed, in the embryos of\r\nserpents and other animals, before the formation of the proper cranial\r\nvertebrae, two symmetrical bands of cartilage, similar to those which I\r\ndiscovered as a persistent structure in _Ammocoetes_.... At a later\r\nperiod the _basis cranii_ of vertebrate animals contains three parts\r\nanalogous to the bodies of vertebrae, the most anterior of which, in the\r\nmajority of animals, is generally small, and its development frequently\r\nabortive, whilst in man and mammiferous animals the three are very\r\ndistinct. These parts are developed by the formation of three distinct\r\npoints of ossification, one behind the other, in the basilar\r\ncartilage.\"[212]\r\n\r\nRathke was very cautious about accepting the vertebral theory of the\r\nskull; he saw that the facts of development were not altogether\r\nfavourable to the theory, and he gave his adherence with many\r\nreservations and saving clauses. His general attitude may be summed up\r\nas follows.[213]\r\n\r\nThe chorda sheath is the common matrix of the vertebrae and of a large\r\npart of the skull. The basilar plate and the trabeculae, which are\r\ndeveloped from the chorda sheath, give origin to three bones, which\r\nmight possibly be considered equivalent to vertebral centra--the\r\nbasioccipital, the basisphenoid, and the _Riechbein_ (ethmoid). The\r\n_Riechbein_ develops from the fused ends of the trabeculae. The\r\npresphenoid might also be considered as a vertebral body, but it\r\ndevelops independently of the basilar plate and trabeculae.\r\n\r\nNow of these bones, the basioccipital is in every way equivalent to a\r\nvertebral centrum, for it develops in the basilar plate round the\r\nnotochord. With the exoccipitals, which arise just like neural arches,\r\nit forms a true vertebra. The supraoccipital is an accessory bone\r\ndeveloped in relation to bigger brains. The basisphenoid appears in the\r\nbasilar plate, but in front of the notochord, nor does it arise in\r\nexactly the same way as the centrum of a vertebra. The basisphenoid with\r\nthe alisphenoids, which develop independently in the side walls of the\r\nbrain, may, however, still be considered as forming a vertebra, though\r\nthe resemblance is not so great as in the case of the occipital ring.\r\nThe presphenoid, being long and pointed, is very unlike a vertebral\r\nbody. The orbitosphenoids develop separately from it. The ethmoid also\r\ndiffers from a vertebra, for it surrounds not the whole nervous axis as\r\nthe two hinder \"vertebrae\" do, but only two prolongations of it, the\r\nolfactory lobes. In its development and final form it shows no\r\nparticular resemblance to a vertebra. Its body, the _pars\r\nperpendicularis_ (mesethmoid) shows no similarity with a vertebral\r\ncentrum. Completing the three hinder cranial \"vertebrae\" and roofing in\r\nthe brain are the supraoccipital, the parietals and the frontals. The\r\npremaxillaries, vomer, and nasals do not belong to the cranial scheme;\r\nthey are covering bones connected with the ethmoid. So, too, the\r\near-capsule is not part of the cranial vertebrae, but is rather to be\r\ncompared to the intercalary bones in the vertebral column of certain\r\nfish. Summing up as regards the cranial vertebrae Rathke writes, \"We find\r\nthat the four different groups of bones, consisting of the basioccipital\r\nwith its intercalary (the supraoccipital), the basisphenoid with its\r\nintercalaries (parietals), the presphenoid with its intercalaries\r\n(frontals), and the ethmoid with its outgrowths (turbinals and\r\ncribriform plate), taking them in order from behind forwards, show an\r\nincreasing divergence from the plan according to which vertebrae as\r\ncommonly understood develop, so that the basioccipital shows the\r\ngreatest resemblance to a vertebra, the ethmoid the least\" (p. 30).\r\n\r\nIn a posthumous volume published in 1861 the same opinion is put\r\nforward. \"In the head, too,\" he writes, \"some vertebrae can be\r\nrecognised, although in a more or less modified form. Yet at most only\r\nfour cranial vertebrae can be assumed, and these differ from ordinary\r\nwell-developed vertebrae in their manner of formation the more the\r\nfarther forward they lie.\"[214]\r\n\r\nRathke was an able and careful critic of the vertebral theory of the\r\nskull, but he accepted it in the main. Actual attack on the theory upon\r\nembryological grounds was begun by C. Vogt, in his work on the\r\ndevelopment of _Coregonus_,[215] and in his paper on the development of\r\n_Alytes_.[216] He described for _Coregonus_ an origin of the skull in the\r\nmain similar to that established by Rathke for the adder. There was a\r\n\"nuchal plate\" in which the front end of the notochord was imbedded; the\r\nnotochord ended at the level of the labyrinth; there were two lateral\r\nbands, comparable to Rathke's lateral trabeculae; a \"facial plate\" was\r\nalso formed, which seems on the whole equivalent to the plate formed by\r\nthe fused anterior ends of the trabeculae. A little later the cranium\r\nformed a complete cartilaginous box surrounding the brain, very similar\r\nto the adult cranium of a shark.\r\n\r\nIn his criticism of the vertebral theory of the skull, Vogt started by\r\ndefining the vertebra as a ring formed round the chorda. Now since only\r\nthe occipital segment of the skull is formed actually round the\r\nnotochord, the parts of the skull lying in front of this cannot\r\nthemselves be vertebrae, though they may be considered as prolongations\r\nof the occipital or nuchal vertebra. \"We must regard the nuchal plate as\r\na true vertebra, modified, it is true, in its formation and development\r\nby its particular functions. Now, since the notochord ends with the\r\nnuchal plate we can no longer regard as vertebrae the parts of the skull\r\nthat lie beyond, such as the lateral processes of the cranium and the\r\nfacial plate, for they have no relation with the notochord\" (p. 123).\r\n\r\nTo support this view he adduced the fact that the vertebral divisions\r\n(primitive vertebrae) visible in the trunk do not extend into the head.\r\nHe used precisely the same arguments in his paper on _Alytes_ to destroy\r\nthe vertebral theory of the skull. We quote the following passage\r\ntranslated by Huxley (1864, p. 295) from this paper. \"It has therefore\r\nbecome my distinct persuasion that the occipital vertebra is indeed a\r\ntrue vertebra, but that everything which lies before it is not fashioned\r\nupon the vertebrate type at all, and that efforts to interpret it in\r\nsuch a way are vain; that, therefore, if we except that vertebra\r\n(occipital) which ends the spinal column anteriorly, there are no\r\ncranial vertebrae at all.\"\r\n\r\nL. Agassiz, himself a pupil of Doellinger, in the general part (1844) of\r\nhis _Recherches sur les Poissons fossiles_ (Neuchatel, 1833-43), repeats\r\nin the main his pupil Vogt's criticism of the vertebral theory (vol. i.,\r\npp. 125-9).\r\n\r\nThese arguments of Vogt and Agassiz were not considered by Mueller to\r\ndispose of the theory,[217] which maintained a firm hold even upon\r\nembryologists. It was still upheld by Reichert, and Koelliker in 1849\r\nshowed himself convinced of its general validity.\r\n\r\nA useful step in the analysis of the concept \"vertebra\" was taken by\r\nRemak,[218] who showed what a complex affair the formation of vertebrae\r\nreally is, involving as it does a complete resegmentation\r\n(_Neugliederung_) of the vertebral column, whereby the original\r\nvertebral bodies were replaced by the secondary definitive bodies (p.\r\n143). Remak showed, as he thought, that the protovertebral segmentation\r\nof the dorsal muscle-plates did not extend into the head, and he denied\r\nReichert's assertion (1837) that the cranial basis in mammals showed\r\ntransverse grooves delimiting three cranial vertebrae (p. 36). The\r\ngill-slits, he considered, could not possibly be regarded as marking the\r\nlimits of head vertebrae.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 appeared Huxley's well-known Croonian Lecture, _On the Theory of\r\nthe Vertebrate Skull_,[219] in which he stated with great clearness and\r\nforce the case for the embryological method of determining homologies,\r\nand criticised with vigour the vertebral theory of the skull. By this\r\ntime the two rival methods in morphology had become clearly\r\ndifferentiated, and Huxley was able to contrast them, or at least to\r\nshow how necessary the new embryological method was as a corrective and\r\na supplement to the older anatomical, or, as he calls it, \"gradation\"\r\nmethod. Applied to the \"Theory of the Skull,\" the gradation method\r\nconsists in comparing the parts of the skull and vertebral column in\r\nadult animals with respect to their form and connections. \"Using the\r\nother method, the investigator traces back skull and vertebral column to\r\ntheir earliest embryonic states and determines the identity of parts by\r\ntheir developmental relations\" (p. 541). This second method is the final\r\nand ultimate. \"The study of the gradations of structure presented by a\r\nseries of living beings may have the utmost value in suggesting\r\nhomologies, but the study of development alone can finally demonstrate\r\nthem\" (p. 541). As an example of the utility and, indeed, the necessity\r\nof applying the embryological method Huxley takes the case of the\r\nquadrate bone in birds. This bone had been generally regarded by\r\nanatomists as the equivalent of the tympanic of mammals, on account of\r\nits connection with the tympanum; but Reichert showed (1837) that the\r\nsame segment of the first visceral arch developed into the incus in\r\nmammals, and into the quadrate in birds, and that therefore the quadrate\r\nwas homologous with the incus. Similarly, on developmental grounds, the\r\nmalleus or hammer of mammals is the homologue of the articular of birds,\r\nsince both are developed from a portion of Meckel's cartilage identical\r\nin form and connections in the two groups. The homologies of the bones\r\nconnected with the jaws in bony fishes had long been a subject of\r\ncontention among comparative anatomists; Huxley shows from his personal\r\nobservations how the development of the visceral arches throws light\r\nupon these difficulties. The mandibular arch in the developing fish is\r\nabruptly angled, as in the embryo of Tetrapoda; the upper prong of it\r\nossifies into the palatine and pterygoid; at the angle is formed the\r\nquadrate (jugal, Cuvier), and to the quadrate is articulated the lower\r\njaw, which ossifies round the lower prong or Meckel's cartilage. The\r\nscheme of development of the jaws is accordingly similar in fish to what\r\nit is in other Vertebrates, and this similarity of development enables\r\nHuxley to recognise what are the true homologues of the quadrate, the\r\npalatine and the pterygoid in adult bony fish, and to prove that the\r\nsymplectic and the metapterygoid (tympanal, Cuvier) are bones peculiar\r\nto fish. In developing Amphibia Huxley found a suspensorium of hyoid and\r\nmandibular arches similar to the hyomandibular of fish.\r\n\r\nTackling his main problem of the unity of plan of the vertebrate skull,\r\nHuxley shows, by a careful discussion of the anatomical relationships of\r\nthe chief bones in typical examples of all vertebrate classes, that\r\nthere is on the whole unity of plan as regards the osseous skull. This\r\nunity of composition can be established, on the gradation method, by\r\nconsidering the connections of the bones of the skull with one another,\r\ntheir relations to the parts of the brain and to the foramina of the\r\nprincipal cranial nerves. The assistance of the embryological method is,\r\nhowever, necessary in determining many points with regard to the bones\r\ndeveloped in relation to the visceral arches. But there is a further\r\nstep to be taken. \"Admitting ... that a general unity of plan pervades\r\nthe organisation of the ossified skull, the important fact remains that\r\nmany vertebrated animals--all those fishes, in fact, which are known as\r\n_Elasmobranchii_, _Marsipobranchii_, _Pharyngobranchii_ and _Dipnoi_\r\nhave no bony skull at all, at least in the sense in which the words have\r\nhitherto been used\" (p. 571). The membranous or cartilaginous skull of\r\nthese fishes shows a general resemblance in its main features to the\r\nossified skull of other Vertebrates; the relations of the ear to the\r\nvagus and trigeminal nerves are, for instance, the same in both; the\r\nmain regions of the cartilaginous skull can be homologised with definite\r\nbones or groups of bones in the bony skull; but discrepancies occur. It\r\nis again to development that we must turn to discover the true\r\nrelationship of the cartilaginous to the ossified skull. \"The study of\r\nthe development of the ossified vertebrate skull ... satisfactorily\r\nproves that the adult crania of the lower _Vertebrata_ are but special\r\ndevelopments[220] of conditions through which the embryonic crania of\r\nthe highest members of the sub-kingdom pass\" (p. 573). It is with the\r\nembryonic cranium of higher Vertebrates that the adult skull of the\r\nlower fishes must be compared, and the comparison will show a\r\nsubstantial though not a complete agreement between them. Thus, speaking\r\nof the development of the frog's skull, Huxley writes:--\"If, bearing in\r\nmind the changes which are undergone by the palatosuspensorial\r\napparatus, ... we now compare the stages of development of the frog's\r\nskull with the persistent conditions of the skull in the _Amphioxus_,\r\nthe lamprey, and the shark, we shall discover the model and type of the\r\nlatter in the former. The skull of the _Amphioxus_ presents a\r\nmodification of that plan which is exhibited by the frog's skull when\r\nits walls are still membranous and the notochord is not yet embedded in\r\ncartilage. The skull of the lamprey is readily reducible to the same\r\nplan of structure as that which is exhibited by the tadpole when its\r\ngills are still external and its blood colourless. And finally, the\r\nskull of the shark is at once intelligible when we have studied the\r\ncranium in further advanced larvae, or its cartilaginous basis in the\r\nadult frog\" (p. 577). Development, therefore, proves what comparative\r\nanatomy could only foreshadow--the unity of plan of all vertebrate\r\nskulls, ossified and unossified alike. \"We have thus attained to a\r\ntheory or general expression of the laws of structure of the skull. All\r\nvertebrate skulls are originally alike; in all (save _Amphioxus_?) the\r\nbase of the primitive cranium undergoes the mesocephalic flexure, behind\r\nwhich the notochord terminates, while immediately in front of it the\r\npituitary body is developed;[221] in all, the cartilaginous cranium has\r\nprimarily the same structure--a basal plate enveloping the end of the\r\nnotochord and sending forth three processes, of which one is short and\r\nmedian, while the other two, the lateral trabeculae, pass on each side of\r\nthe space on which the pituitary body rests, and unite in front of it;\r\nin all, the mandibular arch is primarily attached behind the level of\r\nthe pituitary space, and the auditory capsules are enveloped by a\r\ncartilaginous mass, continuous with the basal plate between them. The\r\namount of further development to which the primary skull may attain\r\nvaries, and no distinct ossifications at all may take place in it; but\r\nwhen such ossification does occur, the same bones are developed in\r\nsimilar relations to the primitive cartilaginous skull\" (p. 578).\r\n\r\nIn a word, there is a general plan or primordial type which is\r\nmanifested in the higher forms most clearly in their earliest\r\ndevelopment--an embryological archetype therefore.\r\n\r\nHuxley now goes on to consider the relation of this general plan or type\r\nof the skull to the structure and development of the vertebral column.\r\nDoes the skull in its development show any signs of a composition out of\r\nseveral vertebrae? The vertebral column develops as a segmented structure\r\nround the notochord; the skull develops first as an unsegmented plate\r\nextending far beyond the notochord. The processes of this basilar plate,\r\nthe trabeculae, are quite unlike anything in the vertebral column. It is\r\ntrue that when the process of ossification begins, separate bones are\r\ndifferentiated in the basilar plate one in front of the other, giving an\r\nappearance of segmentation. The hindmost of these bones, the\r\nbasioccipital, ossifies round the notochord, quite like a vertebral\r\ncentrum, and its side parts which form the occipital arch develop in a\r\n\"remotely similar\" way to the neural arches of the vertebrae. The next\r\nbone, however, the basisphenoid, develops in front of the notochord, and\r\nshows very little analogy with a vertebral body. The analogy is even\r\nmore far-fetched when applied to the axial bones in front of the\r\nbasisphenoid. The cranium might indeed be divided upon ossification into\r\na series of segments bearing a more or less remote analogy with\r\nvertebrae. \"In the process of ossification there is a certain analogy\r\nbetween the spinal column and the cranium, but that analogy becomes\r\nweaker and weaker as we proceed towards the anterior end of the skull\"\r\n(p. 585). The best way to state the facts is to say that both skull and\r\nvertebral column start in their development from the same point, but\r\nimmediately begin to diverge. The clear indications of segmentation\r\nwhich fully ossified adult skulls undoubtedly show are, therefore,\r\nsecondary, and the vertebral theory of the skull, which was originally\r\nbased upon the appearance of such fully ossified crania, is on the whole\r\nnegatived by embryology.\r\n\r\nWe have now to turn back a few years in order to follow up another line\r\nof discovery which had an important bearing upon the theory of the\r\nvertebrate skull--the working out of the distinction between membrane\r\nand cartilage bones.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1731, R. Nesbitt,[222] in two lectures delivered to the Royal\r\nCollege of Surgeons, demonstrated that in the human foetus some bones\r\nwere formed not in cartilage but directly in fibrous tissue, and this\r\nobservation was confirmed by other human anatomists, particularly by\r\nSharpey at a considerably later date. In 1822 Arendt[223] focussed\r\nattention upon the remarkable structure of the skull of the Pike, with\r\nits cartilaginous brain-box studded all over with bony plaques, an\r\narrangement which had already attracted the interest of Cuvier and\r\nMeckel. K. E. von Baer[224] in 1826 discussed at some length the relation\r\nbetween the bony and the cartilaginous skull in fishes, with particular\r\nreference to the sturgeon, coming to the following just conclusion:--\"If\r\nwe consider the fibrous skeleton of _Ammocoetes_ as the first foundation\r\nof the skeleton of Vertebrates, we can form a series among the\r\ncartilaginous fishes, according as a cartilaginous skeleton penetrates\r\nmore and more into this fibrous foundation. In the same way the process\r\nof ossification supplants the cartilaginous skeleton. So long as the\r\nossifications lie in the skin, as in the sturgeon, they form corneous\r\nbones (_Hornknochen_), but when they lie under the skin, they form true\r\nbones, _e.g._, the bones of the skull in the pike\" (p. 374).\r\n\r\nEmbryologists soon become aware that a similar distinction between a\r\nprimitive cartilaginous foundation and a secondary overlying\r\nossification of the skull showed itself in the development of all\r\nVertebrates. Duges, in his _Recherches sur l'osteologie et la myologie\r\ndes Batraciens_ (1834), distinguished between such bones as are formed\r\nby direct ossification of the cartilaginous groundwork of the skull, and\r\nsuch as are developed in the periosteal fibrous tissue.\r\n\r\nReichert in 1838[225] noted that several of the skull bones in Amphibia\r\nare formed without the intermediary of cartilage, such as the nasals,\r\nthe maxillaries and the lacrymals. So, too, the frontals and parietals\r\nof Teleosts developed independently of the cartilaginous skull, and\r\nbelonged to the skeletal system of the skin, not to the true vertebral\r\naxial skeleton (pp. 215-6). Even more interesting was his discovery,\r\nafterwards confirmed by Hertwig,[226] that in the newt several bones\r\nconnected with the palate were formed in the mucous membrane of the\r\nmouth by the fusion of a number of little conical teeth (p. 97). Certain\r\nof these bones he considered to be the substitutes, not the equivalents,\r\nof the palatine and pterygoid of other Vertebrates, which are formed\r\nfrom the upper part of the first visceral arch, a part missing in the\r\nnewt (p. 100). Owing to the difference of development he would not\r\nhomologise these bones in the newt with the palatine and pterygoid of\r\nother Vertebrates. He recognised also that the bone now known as the\r\nparasphenoid was developed in the frog in the mucous membrane of the\r\nmouth, and had originally no connection with the cranial basis (p. 34).\r\nRathke in 1839 also allowed the distinction between cartilage and\r\nmembrane bone, but laid no stress upon it (_Entw. d. Natter._, p. 197).\r\n\r\nJacobson in 1842[227] introduced the useful term, \"primordial cranium,\"\r\nfor the primitive cartilaginous foundation of the skull, and drew a\r\nsharp distinction between cartilage bones and membrane bones.\r\n\r\nIn his _Recherches sur les Poissons fossiles_,[228] L. Agassiz used Vogt's\r\nwork on the development of _Coregonus_ to establish a classification of\r\nthe bones of the skull in fish, a classification which had the merit of\r\ndrawing a sharp distinction between the cartilaginous groundwork and\r\nthe \"protective plates\" of the fish's skull. He recognised that the\r\nprotective plates developed in a different way from the other bones of\r\nthe skull. \"We must distinguish,\" he writes, \"two kinds of ossification;\r\none which tends to transform the primitive parts of the embryonic\r\ncranium directly into bone, and another which leads to the deposition of\r\nprotective plates round this core, which develop not only upon the upper\r\nsurface, as has hitherto been supposed, but also on the lateral walls\r\nand on the lower surface of the cranium\" (p. 112). In the skull of all\r\nfish there are three elements--(1) the cartilaginous base, including the\r\nnuchal plate, the trabeculae and the facial plate, together with the\r\nauditory capsules; (2) the cartilaginous cerebral envelope; (3) the bony\r\nprotective plates (absent in Elasmobranchs). The bones developed in\r\nrelation to these cranial elements can be classified as follows:--(1)\r\nthe basioccipital, exoccipitals (paroccipitals?), supraoccipital and\r\n\"petrous\" (_rocher_), developed from the nuchal plate; the ali- and\r\norbito-sphenoids developed from the trabeculae; the \"cranial ethmoid\"[229]\r\ndeveloped from the facial plate; (2) the parietals, frontals and nasals\r\nformed from the \"superior\" protective plate; the \"anterior\" and\r\n\"posterior\" frontals and the temporal, from the \"lateral\" plates; the\r\nbody of the sphenoid and the vomer from the \"inferior\" plates. The other\r\nelement, the cartilaginous brain-box, does not ossify, and tends to\r\nbecome absorbed (p. 124).\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Koelliker published a paper[230] dealing with the morphological\r\nsignificance of the distinction between membrane and cartilage bones,\r\nand in 1850[231] he defended his views against the criticisms of\r\nReichert[232] in a further note entitled _Die Theorie des\r\nPrimordialschaedels festgehalten_. It is convenient to consider these\r\npapers together. Koelliker held that there was (1) a histological and (2)\r\na morphological difference between the two categories of bones. The\r\nhistological development of the two kinds was different, but this\r\ndifference was not sufficient to establish a morphological distinction\r\nbetween them, a distinction in their anatomical _Bedeutung_. The true\r\nmorphological distinction between them was their development in\r\ndifferent skeleton-forming layers. Membrane bones were developed in\r\nfibrous tissue lying between the skin and the deep layer which formed\r\nthe primordial cranium, and it was this formation in a separate layer\r\nthat gave them a different morphological significance from the bones\r\nformed directly in the deep layer. Koelliker's distinction, therefore,\r\nwas between the bones formed in the primordial cartilaginous cranium on\r\nthe one hand, and the superficial ossifications in fibrous tissue on the\r\nother hand. The cartilaginous cranium in Koelliker's opinion was formed\r\nupon the vertebral type, and the membrane bones were accessory. This, at\r\nleast, was his opinion in 1849. In 1850, after Stannius had shown that\r\nmembrane bones occurred as integral parts of the vertebrae in certain\r\nfish, he modified his view of the membrane bones, and admitted them, at\r\nleast in some cases, as constituents of the cranial vertebrae.\r\n\r\nOn this morphological distinction of membrane and cartilage bones future\r\ncomparative osteology was to be based:--\r\n\r\n\"My sole aim is to state again the principle upon which comparative\r\nosteology is to be based and extended, and this is that first place\r\nshould be assigned to anatomical considerations, and among these to the\r\nmanner of origin of the whole bone in relation to the skeleton-forming\r\nlayers\" (1850, p. 290).\r\n\r\nThe homologies established by this new principle might run counter to\r\nthe homologies indicated by the study of adult structure. \"Thus, for\r\ninstance, although the lower jaw in position, function, form and shape,\r\nappears to be the same bone throughout, yet it must be admitted that it\r\nshows a difference in the different classes. In Mammals and Man it is an\r\nentirely secondary bone (an extremity according to Reichert), in Birds,\r\nAmphibia and Fishes only partially so, for its articular belongs to\r\nMeckel's cartilage and is accordingly analogous to a rib; indeed, in the\r\nPlagiostomes, etc., the whole lower jaw along with the articular is a\r\npersistent Meckel's cartilage\" (p. 290, 1850).\r\n\r\nSo, too, the supraoccipital in man cannot be fully homologised with the\r\nsupraoccipital of many mammals, for its upper half arises at first in\r\nisolation as a secondary bone (p. 290).\r\n\r\nReichert objected to the distinction drawn by Koelliker, and denied that\r\nthere was either a histological or a morphological difference between\r\nmembrane and cartilage bones. It was shown a few years later by H.\r\nMueller[233] that there was in truth no essential difference in\r\nhistological development between the two categories of bone, that the\r\ncartilage cells were replaced by bone cells identical with those taking\r\npart in the formation of membrane bones. The morphological distinction\r\ncontinued however to be recognised, particularly by the embryologists.\r\nRathke in his volume of 1861[234] classified the bones of the skull\r\naccording to their origin from the primordial cranium or from the\r\noverlying fibrous layer, distinguishing as membrane bones, the\r\nparietals, frontals, nasals, lachrymals, maxillaries and premaxillaries,\r\njugals, tympanic, parts of the \"temporal,\" vomer, part of the\r\nsupraoccipitals in some mammals, and the mandible (with the exception of\r\nthe articular in such as have a quadrate bone). Huxley was also inclined\r\nin 1864[235] to recognise the distinction, but he writes with some\r\nreserve:--\"Is there a clear line of demarcation between membrane bones\r\nand cartilage bones? Are certain bones always developed primarily from\r\ncartilage, while certain others as constantly originate in membrane? And\r\nfurther, if a membrane bone is found in the position ordinarily occupied\r\nby a cartilage bone, is it to be regarded merely as the analogue and not\r\nas the homologue of the latter?\" (p. 296).\r\n\r\nWe may note here that many comparative anatomists of the period were\r\nquite ready to decide Huxley's last question in a sense favourable to\r\nthe older, purely anatomical, view of homology. Owen, for instance, held\r\nthat difference of development did not disturb homologies established by\r\nform and connections. \"Parts are homologous,\" he writes, \"in the sense\r\nin which the term is used in this work, which are not always similarly\r\ndeveloped: thus the 'pars occipitalis stricte dicta,' etc., of\r\nSoemmering is the special homologue of the supraoccipital bone of the\r\ncod, although it is developed out of pre-existing cartilage in the fish\r\nand out of aponeurotic membrane in the human subject.\"[236] Similarly he\r\npointed to the diversities of development of the vertebral centrum in\r\nthe different vertebrate classes as proof that development could not\r\nalways be relied upon in deciding homologies (p. 89). But he could not\r\ndeny that the archetype was better shown in the embryo than in the adult\r\n(_supra_, p. 108).\r\n\r\nJ. V. Carus[237] likewise stood firm for the older method of determining\r\nhomologies by comparison of adult structure. \"We can regard as\r\nhomologous,\" he writes, \"only those parts which in the fully formed\r\nanimal possess a like position and show the same topographical relations\r\nto the neighbouring parts\" (p. 389). Parts homologous in this sense\r\nmight develop in different ways, but no great importance was to be\r\nattached to such a circumstance. Membrane and cartilage bones developed\r\nin practically the same way, from the same skeleton-forming layer, and\r\nno morphological significance attached to their distinction (pp. 227,\r\n457). Embryology was of considerable value in helping to determine\r\nhomologies, but the evidence that it supplied was contributory, not\r\nconclusive. Perhaps the greatest service which the study of development\r\nrendered was to disentangle, by a comparison of the earliest embryos,\r\nthe generalised type (p. 389).\r\n\r\nWe have now traced, by our historical study of the theory of the skull,\r\nthe gradual evolution of the tendency to find in development the surest\r\nguide to determining homologies. We have seen how the embryological\r\n\"type\" came to be substituted, in whole or in part, for the anatomical\r\n\"type\" derived from the study of adult structure. But we have had to do\r\nonly with a modification, not with a transformation, of the criterion of\r\nhomology recognised by the anatomists. Homology is still determined by\r\nposition, by connections, in the embryo as in the adult. \"Similarity of\r\ndevelopment\" has become the criterion of homology in the eyes of the\r\nembryologist, but \"similarity of development\" means, not identity of\r\nhistological differentiation, but similarity of connections throughout\r\nthe course of development. For the purposes of morphology, development\r\nhas to be considered as an orderly sequence of successive forms, not in\r\nits real nature as a process essentially continuous. Morphology has to\r\nreplace the living continuity by a kinematographic succession of stages.\r\nSince it is the earliest of these stages that manifest the simplest and\r\nmost generalised structural relations of the parts, it is in the earlier\r\nstages that homologies can be most easily determined. But these\r\nhomologies are still determined solely by the relative positions and\r\nconnections of the parts, just as homologies are determined in the last\r\nof all the stages of development, the adult state. And since the\r\ngeneralised type is shown most clearly in the earliest stages and tends\r\nto become obscured by later differentiation, homologies observed in\r\nembryonic life are to be upheld even if the relations in adult life seem\r\nto indicate different interpretations.\r\n\r\n    [183] See review by Cuvier, _Mem.

Aristotle had distinguished three--the unorganised\r\nmaterial, itself compounded of the four primitive elements, earth and\r\nwater, air and fire, the homogeneous parts or tissues and the\r\nheterogeneous parts or organs, and this conception was retained with\r\nlittle change even to the days of Cuvier and von Baer. Those of the old\r\nanatomists who speculated on the relations of organic elements to one\r\nanother were dominated by Aristotle's simple and profound\r\nclassification, and proposed schemes which differed from his only in\r\ndetail. Bichat enlarged and deepened the concept of tissue, but the\r\ndegree of composition below this was for him, as for all anatomists of\r\nhis time, a fibrous or pulpy \"cellulosity,\" living, indeed, but showing\r\nno uniform and elemental structure. It was Schwann's merit to interpose\r\nbetween the tissue and the mere unorganised material a new element of\r\nstructure, the cell. And, as it happened, a few years before Schwann\r\npublished his cell-theory, Dujardin hinted at another degree of\r\ncomposition which was later to take its place between the cell and the\r\nchemical elements--sarcode or protoplasm.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the concept of the cell arose first in botany. Robert\r\nHooke discovered cells in cork and pith in 1667, and his discovery was\r\nfollowed up by Grew and Malpighi in 1671, and by Leeuenhoek in 1695. But\r\nthey did not conceive the cell as a living, independent, structural\r\nunit. They were interested in the physiology of the plant as a whole,\r\nhow it lived and nourished itself, and they studied cells and\r\nsieve-tubes, wood fibres and tracheae with a view rather to finding out\r\ntheir functions and their significance for the life of the plant than to\r\ndiscovering the minutiae of their structure. The same attitude was taken\r\nup by the few botanists who in the 18th century paid any heed to the\r\nmicroscopical anatomy of plants. For C. F. Wolff,[238] the formation of\r\ncells was a result of the secretion of drops of sap in the fundamental\r\nsubstance of the plant, this substance remaining as cell-walls when\r\ncell-formation was completed--no idea here of cells as units of\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nIn the early 19th century, interest in plant anatomy revived somewhat,\r\nand much work was done by Treviranus, Mirbel, Moldenhawer, Meyen and von\r\nMohl.[239] As a result of their work the fact was established that the\r\ntissues of plants are composed of elements which can, with few\r\nexceptions, be reduced to one simple fundamental form--the spherical\r\nclosed cell. Thus the vessels of plants are formed by coalescence of\r\ncells, fibres by the elongation of cells and the thickening and\r\ntoughening of their walls. At this time, interest was concentrated on\r\nthe cell-wall, to the almost total neglect of the cell-contents; the\r\n\"matured framework\" of plant cells, to use Sach's convenient phrase, was\r\nthe chief, almost the sole, object of study. And it was natural enough\r\nthat the mere architecture of the plant should monopolise interest, that\r\nthe composition of the tissues out of the cells, and the fitting\r\ntogether of the tissues to form the plant should awaken and hold the\r\ncuriosity of the investigator; even the modifications of the cell-walls\r\nthemselves, their rings and spiral thickenings and pits, offered a\r\nfascinating field of enquiry.\r\n\r\nThe idea that the cell-contents might show a characteristic and\r\nindividual structure had hardly dawned upon botanists when Schleiden\r\npublished his famous paper, _Beitraege zur Phytogenesis_.[240] Schleiden's\r\ntheme in this paper is the origin and development of the plant cell, a\r\nsubject then very obscure, in spite of pioneer work by Mirbel. A few\r\nyears before, Robert Brown had called attention to the presence in the\r\nepidermal cells of orchids and other plants of a characteristic spot\r\nwhich he called the areola or nucleus.[241] Schleiden saw the importance\r\nof this discovery, confirmed the constant presence of the nucleus in\r\nyoung cells, and held it to be an elementary organ of the cell. He named\r\nit the cytoblast because, in his opinion, it formed the cell. It was\r\nembedded in a peculiar gummy substance, the cytoblastem, which formed a\r\nlining to the cellulose cell-wall. Within the nucleus there was often a\r\nsmall dark spot or sphere--the nucleolus. The nucleus, Schleiden\r\nthought, originated as a minute granule in the cytoblastem which\r\ngradually increased in size, becoming first a nucleolus (_Kernchen_),\r\nand then, by further condensation of matter round it, a nucleus. Several\r\nnuclei might be formed in this way in a single cell. New cells took\r\ntheir origin directly from a full-grown nucleus, in a peculiar way which\r\nSchleiden describes as follows:--\"As soon as the cytoblasts have reached\r\ntheir full size a delicate transparent vesicle arises on their surface;\r\nthis is the young cell, which at first takes the shape of a very flat\r\nsegment of a sphere, of which the plane surface is formed by the\r\ncytoblast, the convex side by the young cell itself, which lies upon the\r\ncytoblast like a watch-glass on a watch\" (p. 145). The young cells\r\nincrease in size and fill up the cavity of the old cell, which is in\r\ntime resorbed. Cell-development always takes place within existing\r\ncells, and either one or many new cells may be formed within the\r\nmother-cell. Schleiden's views on cell-formation were drawn from some\r\nrather imperfect observations on the embryo-sac and pollen-tube, but he\r\nextended his theory to cell-formation in general. Though wrong in almost\r\nall respects the theory had at least the merit of fixing attention upon\r\nthe really important constituents of the cell, the nucleus and the\r\ncell-plasma. To Schleiden, too, we owe the conception of the cell as a\r\nmore or less independent living unity, whose life is not entirely\r\nidentified with the life of the plant as a whole. \"Each cell,\" he\r\nwrites, \"carries on a double life; one a quite independent and\r\nself-contained life, the other a dependent life in so far as the cell\r\nhas become an integral part of the plant\" (p. 138).\r\n\r\nSo long as the definition of the plant cell embraced little more than\r\nthe hardened cell-wall it was little wonder that \"cells\" in this sense\r\nwere not recognised in animal tissues, except in a few exceptional\r\ncases--as in the notochord by Johannes Mueller.[242] Careful observation of\r\nanimal tissues discovered in some cases the existence of discontinuous\r\nunits of structure, but these were not, as a rule, recognised before\r\n1838 as analogous to plant cells. Von Baer, for example, observed that\r\nthe young chick embryo was composed partly of an albuminous mass and\r\npartly of _Kuegelchen_ or little globules suspended in it\r\n(_Entwickelungsgeschichte_, i., pp. 19, 144). Since such _Kuegelchen_\r\ndisposed in a row formed the notochord (i., p. 145) it seems probable\r\nthat his _Kuegelchen_ were really cells. Similarly A. de Quatrefages[243]\r\nin 1834 saw and figured segmentation spheres in the developing egg of\r\n_Limnaea_, but he called them globules and did not recognise their\r\nanalogy with the cells of plants. According to M'Kendrick,[244] Fontana,\r\nso far back as 1781,[245] described cells with nuclei in various tissues,\r\nand used acids and alkalis to bring out their structure more clearly.\r\nBut it was not till 1836-7-8 that a fairly widespread occurrence of\r\ncells in animal tissues was recognised. The pioneer in this seems to\r\nhave been Purkinje, who described cells in the choroidal plexus in\r\n1836,[246] and compared gland cells with the cells of plants in 1837.[247]\r\nHenle in 1837[248] and 1838[249] described various kinds of epithelial\r\ntissue, distinguishing them according to the kind of cell composing\r\nthem; he also discovered the mode of growth of stratified epithelium.\r\nValentin[250] appears to have seen cells in cartilage and epithelium even\r\nbefore Henle, and to have observed cells in the blastoderm of the chick.\r\nIn his report on the progress of anatomy during 1838 Johannes Mueller was\r\nable to refer to quite a number of papers dealing with the occurrence of\r\ncells in animal tissues. In addition to those already noted, he mentions\r\nwork by Breschet and Gluge on the cells of the umbilical cord, by\r\nDumortier on the cells in the liver of molluscs, by Remak and by\r\nPurkinje on nerve cells, by Donne on the cells of the conjuctiva, cornea\r\nand lens. He reports, too, that Turpin had compared the epithelial cells\r\nof the vagina with the cell-tissue of plants. Mueller himself had not\r\nonly recognised the cellular nature of the notochord, but had observed\r\nthe cells of the vitreous humour, fat cells and pigment cells, and even\r\nthe nuclei of cartilage cells. From Schwann (1839) we learn that C. H.\r\nSchults had followed back the corpuscles of the blood to their original\r\nstate of nucleated cells, and that Werneck had recognised cells in the\r\nembryonic lens. A preliminary notice of Schwann's own work appeared in\r\n1838 (Froriep's _Notizen_, No. 91, 1838), the full memoir in 1839, under\r\nthe title _Mikroskopische Untersuchungen ueber die Uebereinstimmung in\r\nder Struktur und dem Wachstume der Tiere und Pflanzen_.[251]\r\n\r\nTheodor Schwann was a pupil of Johannes Mueller, and we know that Mueller\r\ntook much interest in the new histology. It is probably to his influence\r\nthat we owe Schwann's brilliant work on the cell, which appeared just\r\nafter Schwann left Berlin for Loewen. Schwann was himself, as his later\r\nwork showed, more a physiologist than a morphologist; he did quite\r\nfundamental work on enzymes, discovering and isolating the pepsin of the\r\ngastric juice; he proved that yeast was not an inorganic precipitate but\r\na mass of living cells; he carried out experiments directed to show that\r\nspontaneous generation does not occur. We shall see in his treatment of\r\nthe cell-theory clear indications of his physiological turn of mind.\r\nSchwann was only twenty-nine when his master-work appeared, and the book\r\nis clearly the work of a young man. It has the clear structure, the\r\nlogical finish, which the energy of youth imparts to its chosen work. So\r\nthe work of Rathke's prime, the _Anatomische-philosophische\r\nUntersuchungen_ of 1832 shows more vigour and a more reasoned structure\r\nthan his later papers. Schwann's book is indeed a model of construction\r\nand cumulative argument, and even for this reason alone justly deserves\r\nto rank as a classic.\r\n\r\nThe first section of his book is devoted to a detailed study of the\r\nstructure and development of cartilage cells and of the cells of the\r\nnotochord, and to a comparison of these with plant cells. He accepts\r\nSchleiden's account of the origin and development of nuclei and cells as\r\na standard of comparison; and he seeks to show that nucleus and\r\nnucleolus, cell-wall and cell-contents, show the same relations and\r\nbehave in the same manner in these two types of animal cells as in the\r\nplant-cells studied by Schleiden. The types of cell which he chose for\r\nthis comparison are the most plant-like of all animal cells, and he was\r\neven able to point to a thickening of the cell-wall in certain cartilage\r\ncells, analogous to the thickening which plays so important a part in\r\nthe outward modification of plant-cells. The analogy indeed in structure\r\nand development between chorda and cartilage cells and the cells of\r\nplants seemed to him complete. The substance of the notochord consisted\r\nof polyhedral cells having attached to their wall an oval disc similar\r\nin all respects to the nucleus of the plant-cell, and like it containing\r\none or more nucleoli. Inside the mother-cell were to be found young\r\ndeveloping cells of spherical shape, lacking however a nucleus.\r\nCartilage was even more like plant tissue. It was composed of cells,\r\neach with its cell membrane. The cells lay close to one another,\r\nseparated only by their thickened cell-wall and the intercellular\r\nmatrix, showing thus even the general appearance of the cellular tissue\r\nof plants. They contained a nucleus with one or two nucleoli, and the\r\nnucleus was often resorbed, as in plants, when the cell reached its full\r\ndevelopment. Other nuclei were in many cases present in the cell, round\r\nwhich young cells could be seen to develop, in exactly the same manner\r\nas in plants. These nuclei had accordingly the same significance as the\r\nnuclei of plants, and deserved the same name of cytoblasts or\r\ncell-generators. The true nucleus of the cartilage cell was probably in\r\nthe same way the original generator of the mother-cell.\r\n\r\nHaving proved the identity in structure and function of the cells of\r\nthese selected tissues with the cells of plants, as conceived by\r\nSchleiden, Schwann had still to show that the generality of animal\r\ntissues consisted either in their adult or in their embryonic state of\r\nsimilar cells. This demonstration occupies the second and longest\r\nsection of his book.\r\n\r\nHis method is throughout genetic; he seeks to show, not so much that all\r\nanimal tissues are actually in their finished state composed of cells\r\nand modifications of cells, as that all tissues, even the most complex,\r\nare developed from cells analogous in structure and growth with the\r\ncells of plants.\r\n\r\nAll animals develop from an ovum; it was his first task to discover\r\nwhether the ovum was or was not a cell. It happened that, some years\r\nbefore Schwann wrote, a good deal of work had been done on the minute\r\nstructure of the ovum, particularly by Purkinje and von Baer. Purkinje\r\nin 1825[252] discovered and described in the unfertilised egg of the fowl\r\na small vesicle containing granular matter, which he named the\r\n_Keimblaeschen_ or germinal vesicle. It disappeared in the fertilised\r\negg. As early as 1791 Poli had seen the germinal vesicle in the eggs of\r\nmolluscs, but the first adequate account was given by Purkinje. In\r\n1827[253] von Baer discovered the true ova of mammals and cleared up a\r\npoint which had been a stumbling block ever since the days of von Graaf,\r\nwho had described as the ova the follicles now bearing his name.[254] Even\r\nvon Graaf had noticed that the early uterine eggs were smaller than the\r\nsupposed ovarian eggs; Prevost and Dumas[255] had observed the presence in\r\nthe Graafian follicle of a minute spherical body, which, however, they\r\nhesitated to call the ovum; it was left to von Baer to elucidate the\r\nstructure of the follicle and to prove that this small sphere was indeed\r\nthe mammalian ovum. His discovery was confirmed by Sharpey and by Allen\r\nThomson. Von Baer found the germinal vesicle in the eggs of frogs,\r\nsnakes, molluscs, and worms, but not in the mammalian ovum; he\r\nconsidered the whole mammalian ovum to be the equivalent of the germinal\r\nvesicle of birds--a comparison rightly questioned by Purkinje (1834). In\r\n1834 Coste[256] discovered in the ovum of the rabbit a vesicle which he\r\nconsidered to be the germinal vesicle of Purkinje; he observed that it\r\ndisappeared after fertilisation. Independently of Coste, and very little\r\ntime after him, Wharton Jones[257] found the germinal vesicle in the\r\nmammalian ovum. Valentin in 1835,[258] Wagner in 1836,[259] and Krause in\r\n1837,[260] added considerably to the existing knowledge of the structure\r\nof the ovum. Wagner in his _Prodromus_ called attention to the\r\nwidespread occurrence, within the germinal vesicle of a darker speck\r\nwhich he called the _Keimfleck_ or germinal spot, known sometimes as\r\nWagner's spot. He recognised the _Keimfleck_ in the ova of many classes\r\nof animals from mammals to polyps. Frequently more than one _Keimfleck_\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nSchwann had therefore a good deal of exact knowledge to go upon in\r\ndiscussing the significance of the ovum for the cell-theory. There were\r\ntwo possible interpretations. Either the ovum was a cell and the\r\ngerminal vesicle its nucleus, or else the germinal vesicle was itself a\r\ncell within the larger cell of the ovum and the germinal spot was its\r\nnucleus. Schwann had some difficulty in deciding which of these views to\r\nadopt, but he finally inclined to the view that the ovum is a cell and\r\nthe germinal vesicle its nucleus, basing his opinion largely upon\r\nobservations by Wagner which tended to prove that the germinal vesicle\r\nwas formed first and the ovum subsequently formed round it. But the ovum\r\nwas not, in Schwann's view, a simple cell, for within it were contained\r\nyolk-granules, one set apparently containing a nucleus, the others not.\r\nEven the second set, those composing the yellow yolk, were considered by\r\nSchwann to deserve the name of cells, because, although a nucleus could\r\nnot be observed in them, they had a definite membrane, distinct from\r\ntheir contents--a conception of the cell obviously dating from the\r\nearliest botanical notions of cells as little sacs. The yolk cells were\r\nnot mere dead food material but living units which took part in the\r\nsubsequent development of the egg. The relation between the unfertilised\r\negg and the blastoderm which arises from it is not made altogether clear\r\nby Schwann. According to his account the cells of the blastoderm are\r\nformed actually in the ovum. Round the nucleus of the egg appears a\r\n_Niederschlag_ or precipitate which is the rudiment of the blastoderm\r\n(p. 68). When the egg leaves the ovary the nucleus disappears, leaving\r\nbehind it this rudiment of the blastoderm, which rapidly grows and\r\nincreases in size. The blastoderm of the chick before incubation is\r\nfound to be composed of spherical anucleate bodies which Schwann\r\nconsiders to be cells, because they almost certainly develop into the\r\ncells of the incubated blastoderm, which are clearly recognisable as\r\nsuch after eight hours' incubation. The serous and mucous layers can be\r\ndistinguished after sixteen hours' incubation, and it is found that the\r\ncells of the serous layer contain definite nuclei, though such seem to\r\nbe absent in the cells of the mucous layer. Between the two layers other\r\ncells are formed belonging to the vessel layer, which is, however, in\r\nSchwann's opinion not a very definitely individualised layer.\r\n\r\nSchwann's next step is a detailed demonstration of the origin of each\r\ntissue from simple cells such as those composing the incubated\r\nblastoderm.\r\n\r\n\"The foregoing investigation has taught us that the whole ovum shows\r\nnothing but a continual formation and differentiation of cells, from the\r\nmoment of its appearance up to the time when, through the development of\r\nthe serous and mucous layers of the blastoderm, the foundation is given\r\nfor all the tissues subsequently appearing: we have found this common\r\nparent of all tissues itself to consist of cells; our next task must be\r\nto demonstrate not only in this general way that tissues originate from\r\ncells, but also that the special formative mass of each tissue is\r\ncomposed of cells, and that all tissues are either constituted by simple\r\ncells or by one or other of the manifold kinds of modified cells\" (p.\r\n71). Five classes of tissue can be distinguished, according to the\r\nextent and manner of the modifications which the cells composing them\r\nhave undergone. There are first of all independent and isolated cells,\r\nsuch as the corpuscles of the blood and lymph, not forming a coherent\r\ntissue in the ordinary sense. Next there are the assemblages of cells\r\nlying in contiguity with one another, but not in any way fused; examples\r\nof this class are the epidermal tissues and the lens of the eye. In the\r\nthird class come tissues the cells of which have fused by their walls,\r\nbut whose cell-cavities are not in continuity, such as osseous tissue\r\nand cartilage. In the tissues of the fourth class, comprising the most\r\nhighly specialised of all, not only are the cell-walls continuous but\r\nalso the cell-cavities; to this class belong muscle, nerve and capillary\r\nvessels. A fifth class, of rather a special nature, includes the fibrous\r\ntissues of all kinds. This is the first classification of tissues upon a\r\ncellular basis, and it marks the foundation of a new histology which\r\ntook the place of the \"general anatomy\" of Bichat. The exhaustive\r\naccount which Schwann gives of the structure and development of the\r\ntissues in this section of his book constitutes the first systematic\r\ntreatise on histology in the modern sense, and it is still worth\r\nreading, in spite of many errors in detail.\r\n\r\nSchwann found it easy to demonstrate the cellular nature of the tissues\r\nof his first three classes. With the other two classes he had more\r\ndifficulty. Fibres of all kinds, he considered, arose by an elongation\r\nof cells, which afterwards split longitudinally into long strips,\r\nforming as the case might be white or elastic fibrous tissue.\r\nMuscle-fibres and nerve-fibres were formed in a totally different way,\r\nby coalescence of cells; each separate muscle-fibre and nerve-fibre was\r\nthus a compound cell. Capillaries, Schwann held, were formed by cells\r\nhollowed out like drain-pipes, and set end to end--a mistaken view soon\r\ncorrected by Vogt (_Embryologie des Salmones_, p. 206, 1842).\r\n\r\nIn this detail part of his book Schwann accumulates material for a\r\ngeneral theory of the cell which he develops in the third and last\r\nsection. Taking up the physiological or dynamical standpoint, he points\r\nout that one process is common to all growth and development of tissues\r\nboth in animals and plants, namely, the formation of cells, a process\r\nwhich he conceives to take place in the following manner. There is,\r\nfirst of all, a structureless substance, the cytoblastem, the matrix in\r\nwhich all cells originate. The cytoblastem may be either inside the\r\ncells, or, more usually, in the spaces between them. It is not a\r\nsubstance of definite chemical and physical properties, for the matrix\r\nof cartilage and the plasma of the blood alike come within the\r\ndefinition. It has largely the significance of food material for the\r\ndeveloping cells. In plants, according to Schleiden, cells are never\r\nformed in the intercellular substance--the cytoblastem is within the\r\ncells; but extracellular cell formation seems to be the general rule in\r\nanimals. An intracellular formation of cells occurs only in the ovum, in\r\ncartilage cells and chorda cells and in a few others, and even there it\r\nis not the exclusive method of formation; a formation of cells within\r\ncells never occurs in muscles and nerves, nor in fibrous tissue (p.\r\n204). In the cytoblastem granules appear, which gradually increase in\r\nsize and take on the characteristic shape of nuclei; round each of these\r\na young cell is formed. Sometimes the young cells appear to have no\r\nnuclei, as in the intracellular brood of chorda cells, but, as a rule, a\r\nnucleus is clearly visible. The nucleus is indeed the most\r\ncharacteristic constituent of the cell. \"The most important and most\r\nconstant criterion of the existence of a cell is the presence or absence\r\nof the nucleus,\" writes Schwann near the beginning of his book (p. 43).\r\n\r\nAs a general rule the nucleolus is formed first, and round it by a sort\r\nof condensation or concretion the nucleus, which is frequently hollow,\r\nand round this again, by a somewhat similar process, the cell. \"The\r\nwhole process of the formation of a cell consists in the precipitation\r\nround a small previously formed corpuscle (the nucleolus) of first one\r\nlayer (the nucleus) and then later round this a second layer (the cell\r\nsubstance)\" (p. 213). The outermost layer of the cell usually thickens\r\nto form the membrane, but this membrane formation does not always occur,\r\nand the membrane is not present in all cells. The nucleus is formed in\r\nexactly the same manner as the cell, and it might with much truth itself\r\nbe called a cell--a cell of the first order, while ordinary nucleated\r\ncells might be designated cells of the second order (p. 212). In\r\nanucleate cells there is probably only a single process of layer\r\nformation round an infinitely small nucleolus. In almost all nucleate\r\ncells the nucleus is resorbed when the cell reaches its full\r\ndevelopment, and it is larger and more important the younger the cell\r\nis.\r\n\r\nThe cell was for Schwann not a morphological concept at all, but a\r\nphysiological; the cell was a dynamical, not a statical unit.\r\nCell-formation was the process at the back of all production of life,\r\nand cells were the centres of all vital activity. Each cell was itself\r\nan organism, and its life and activities were to some extent independent\r\nof the lives and activities of all the other cells. The multicellular\r\norganism was a colony of unicellular organisms, and its life was a sum\r\nof the lives of its constituent elements. This \"theory of the organism,\"\r\nwhich holds so important a place in biology even at the present day, is\r\ndeveloped by Schwann in the concluding pages of his book.\r\n\r\nHe begins by contrasting the teleological with the materialistic\r\nconception of living things. In the teleological view, a special force\r\nworks in the living organism, guiding and directing its activities\r\ntowards a purposeful end. According to the materialistic view there are\r\nno other forces at work in the living organism than those which act in\r\nthe inorganic realm, or at least there are none but forces at one with\r\nthese in their blindness and necessity. True, the purposiveness of\r\nliving processes cannot be denied; but its ground lies, according to\r\nthis view, not in a vital force which guides and rules the individual\r\nlife, but in the original creation and collocation of matter according\r\nto a rational plan. The purposiveness of life is part of the\r\npurposiveness of the universe; just as the stars circle for ever in\r\nharmoniously adjusted paths, so do the processes of life work together\r\ntowards a common end. Both are the inevitable result of the original\r\ndistribution of matter in the primitive chaos, a distribution fixed by a\r\nrational and foreknowing Being (p. 222).\r\n\r\nWhich of the two conceptions is to be adopted in biology? Teleological\r\nexplanations have long been banished from the physical sciences, and in\r\nbiology they are only a last resort when physical explanations have\r\nproved incomplete (p. 223). And if the ground of the purposiveness of\r\nliving Nature is the same as the ground of the purposiveness of the\r\nuniverse, is it not reasonable to suppose that explanations which have\r\nproved satisfactory for inorganic things will in time with sufficient\r\nknowledge prove adequate also for organic things?\r\n\r\nThe teleological conception, again, leads to difficulties particularly\r\nwhen it is applied to the facts of reproduction. If we suppose that a\r\nvital force unifies and coordinates the organism and is its very\r\nessence, we must also suppose that this force is divisible and that a\r\npart of it--separated in reproduction--can bring about the same results\r\nas the whole. If on the contrary the forces having play in the organism\r\nare the mere result of the particular combination of the matter\r\ncomposing it, the reconstruction of a particular combination of\r\nmolecules in the ovum is all that is necessary to set development\r\na-going along exactly the course taken by the ovum of the parent.\r\nAnother argument against the teleological view is derived from the facts\r\nof the cell-theory. The cell-theory tells us that the molecules of the\r\nliving body are not immediately built up in manifold combinations to\r\nform the organism, but are formed first into unit-constructions or\r\ncells, and that these units of composition are invariably formed in all\r\ndevelopment, of plants and animals alike, however diverse the goal of\r\ndevelopment may be. If there were a vital principle would we not expect\r\nto find that, scorning this roundabout way of reaching its goal, it went\r\nstraight to the mark, taking a different and distinctive course for each\r\nindividual development, building up the organism direct without the\r\nintermediary of cells? But since there is a universal principle of\r\ndevelopment, namely, the formation of cells, does it not seem that the\r\ncells must be the true organisms, that the whole \"individual\" organism\r\nmust be an aggregate of cells, and that the concept of individuality\r\napplied to the organism is accordingly a logical fiction? And it is just\r\nupon this notion of the individuality of the organism that the\r\nteleological concept is based. The teleological view can perhaps not be\r\ncompletely refuted until the adequacy of materialistic explanations has\r\nbeen finally shown; but it is certain that the most promising method for\r\nresearch is the materialistic (p. 226).\r\n\r\n\"We start out then from the assumption that the basis of the organism is\r\nnot a force acting according to a definite plan; on the contrary, the\r\norganism arises through the action of blind and necessary laws, of\r\nforces which are as much implicit in matter as those of the inorganic\r\nworld. Since the chemical elements in organic Nature differ in no way\r\nfrom those of inorganic Nature, the ground or cause of organic phenomena\r\ncan consist only in a different mode of combination of matter, either in\r\na peculiar mode of combination of the elementary atoms to form atoms of\r\nthe second order, or in the particular arrangement of these compound\r\nmolecules to form the separate morphological units of the organism or\r\nthe whole organism itself\" (p. 226). Accepting then the materialistic\r\nconception of the organism, we have to consider this further problem.\r\nDoes the ground of organic processes lie in the whole organism or in its\r\nelementary parts? Translated into terms of metabolism--note the\r\nphysiological point of view--the question runs, are metabolic processes\r\nthe result of the molecular construction of the organism as a whole, or\r\ndoes the centre of metabolic activity lie in the cell? Is it the cell\r\nrather than the organism that is the immediate agent of assimilatory\r\nprocesses? In the first alternative the cause of the growth of the\r\nconstituent parts lies in the totality of the organism; in the other\r\nalternative:--\"Growth is not the result of a force having its ground in\r\nthe organism as a whole, but each of the elementary parts possesses a\r\nforce of its own, a life of its own, if you will; that is to say, in\r\neach elementary part the molecules are so combined as to set free a\r\nforce whereby the cell is enabled to attract new molecules and so to\r\ngrow, and the whole organism exists only through the reciprocal action\r\nof the single elementary parts.... In this eventuality it is the\r\nelementary parts that form the active element in nutrition, and the\r\ntotality of the organism can be indeed a condition, but on this view it\r\ncannot be a cause\" (p. 227).\r\n\r\nTo help in the decision of this question, appeal must be made to the\r\nfacts established as to the cellular nature of the organism and of its\r\nreproductive elements. We know that every organism is composed of cells,\r\nwhich are formed and grow according to the same laws wherever they are\r\nfound, whose formation therefore is everywhere due to the same forces.\r\nIf we find that certain of these cells--all of which we know to be\r\nessentially identical one with another--have the power when separated\r\nfrom the others of growing and developing into new organisms, we can\r\ninfer that not only such cells but also all other cells have this\r\nassimilatory power. The ova of animals, the spores of plants, the\r\nisolated cells of lower organisms in general, all show the power of\r\nseparate assimilation and development. \"We must therefore, in general,\r\nascribe to the cell an individual life, that is to say, the combination\r\nof the molecules in the single cell does suffice to produce the force\r\nwhereby the cell is enabled to draw to itself new molecules. The ground\r\nof nutrition and growth lies not in the organism as a whole, but in the\r\nseparate elementary parts, the cells. The fact that it is not every cell\r\nthat can continue to grow when separated from the organism is not in\r\nitself an objection to this theory, any more than it is an objection to\r\nthe individual life of a bee that it cannot continue to exist apart from\r\nthe swarm. The activation of the forces existing within the cell depends\r\non conditions which the cell encounters only in connection with the\r\nwhole\" (pp. 228-9).\r\n\r\nSchwann's next step is to discover what are the essential forces active\r\nin the cell, and here he enters the realm of hypothesis. He finds they\r\ncan be reduced to two--an attractive force and a metabolic force. The\r\nattractive force is seen in the process of cell-formation, where first\r\nof all the nucleolus is formed by a concentration and precipitation of\r\nsubstances found free in the cytoblastem, and in the same way the\r\nnucleus and later the cell are laid down as concentric precipitates from\r\nthe cytoblastem. Cell-formation also involves the second or metabolic\r\nforce, by means of which the cell alters the chemical composition of the\r\nmedium surrounding it so as to prepare it for assimilation. Schwann's\r\nattractive force brings about the actual taking up of the prepared\r\nsubstance; his metabolic force is the cause of the digestion of food\r\nsubstances, and is nearly identical with enzyme action. With what\r\ninorganic process, he now asks (p. 239), can the process of\r\ncell-formation be most nearly compared, and the answer obviously is,\r\nwith the process of crystallisation. Cells are, it is true, quite\r\ndifferent in shape and consistency from crystals, and they grow by\r\nintussusception, not by apposition--their plastic or attractive forces\r\nseem therefore to be different. A still more important difference is\r\nthat the metabolic force is peculiar to the cell. Yet there are\r\nimportant analogies between crystals and cells. They agree in the\r\nimportant respect that they both grow in solutions at the cost of the\r\ndissolved substance, according to definite laws, and develop a definite\r\nand characteristic shape. It might even be maintained, Schwann thinks,\r\nthat the attractive force of crystals is really identical with that of\r\ncells, and that the difference in result is due merely to the difference\r\nbetween the substance of the cell and the substance of the crystal. He\r\npoints out how organic bodies are remarkable for their powers of\r\nimbibition, and he seeks to show that the cell is the form under which a\r\nbody capable of imbibition must necessarily crystallise, and that the\r\norganism is an aggregate of such imbibition-crystals. The analogy\r\nbetween crystallisation and cell-formation he works out in the following\r\nmanner:--\"The substance of which cells are composed possesses the power\r\nof chemically transforming the substance with which it is in immediate\r\ncontact, in somewhat the same way as the well-known preparation of\r\nplatinum changes alcohol into acetic acid. Each part of the cell\r\npossesses this property. If now the cytoblastem is altered by an already\r\nformed cell in such a way that a substance is formed that cannot become\r\npart of the cell, it crystallises out first as the nucleolus of a new\r\ncell. This in its turn alters the composition of the cytoblastem. A part\r\nof the transfomed substance may remain in solution in the cytoblastem or\r\nmay crystallise out as the beginning of a new cell; another part, the\r\ncell-substance, crystallises round the nucleolus. The cell-substance is\r\neither soluble in the cytoblastem and crystallises out only when the\r\nlatter is saturated with it, or it is insoluble and crystallises as soon\r\nas it is formed, according to the aforementioned laws of the\r\ncrystallisation of imbibition-bodies; it forms thus one or more layers\r\nround the nucleolus, etc. If one imagines cell-formation to take place\r\nin this way, one is led to think of the plastic force of the cell as\r\nidentical with the force by means of which a crystal grows\" (pp.\r\n249-50).\r\n\r\nTwo difficulties have to be faced by this theory--(1) the origin of the\r\nmetabolic power of the cells, (2) the reason why the cells arrange\r\nthemselves so as to form an organism of complex and definite structure.\r\nSchwann tries to explain the origin of the \"metabolic\" action, the\r\nanalogy of which with the contact-action of colloidal platinum he\r\nrecognises, by attributing it to the peculiar structural arrangements of\r\nmolecules. In attempting to account for the harmonious structure of the\r\norganism he points to the analogy of ordinary crystals, which often form\r\ncomplex and regular tree-like arrangements; plants in particular\r\nresemble these regularly shaped crystal-aggregates.\r\n\r\nThe whole ingenious theory is offered merely as an hypothesis and a\r\nguide to research. It is interesting as one of the most carefully\r\nthought-out attempts ever made to give a thorough-going materialistic\r\naccount of the origin and development of organic form, and it arose\r\ndirectly out of the cell-theory.\r\n\r\nSchleiden and Schwann started out from an erroneous theory of the origin\r\nand development of cells, which impaired to some extent the value of\r\ntheir results. It was not long, however, before their theory of the\r\norigin of cells by \"crystallisation\" from an intra- or extra-cellular\r\ncytoblastem was challenged and overthrown, and the generalisation that\r\ncells originate by division from pre-existing cells put in its place.\r\n\r\nThis was established for plant cells by Meyen, Unger, von Mohl, Naegeli\r\nand Hofmeister in or about the forties.[261] Criticism of the\r\nSchwann-Schleiden theory from the zoological side was suggested by the\r\nstudy of the segmentation of the ovum--the developmental process in\r\nwhich the multiplication of cells is most easily observed. The\r\nsegmentation of the ovum was well known to Schwann, for the process had\r\nbeen described in the frog by Prevost and Dumas in 1824,[262] in the frog\r\nand newt by Rusconi,[263] and an elaborate study of the process in the\r\nfrog had been made by von Baer.[264] Schwann indeed suspected that there\r\nmust be some connection between the segmentation of the ovum and the\r\nformation of cells, but he did not realise that the cellular blastoderm\r\nof the chick was formed by the division or segmentation of the egg-cell.\r\n\r\nSegmentation was soon found to be of widespread occurrence. Von Siebold\r\nin 1837 described the process in Entozoa,[265] and in the same year Loven\r\nsaw segmentation in _Campanularia_,[266] and Sars in the starfish and in\r\nNudibranchs.[267]\r\n\r\nIn 1838 Bischoff[268] observed segmentation in the mammalian ovum, and the\r\nwhole course of segmentation in the ovum of the rabbit from the 2-celled\r\nto the morula stage was carefully described and figured by Barry[269] in\r\n1839. C. Vogt[270] in 1842 described segmentation in _Coregonus_ and\r\n_Alytes_. The discovery of segmentation in the ovum of birds was not\r\nmade until 1847, by Bergmann,[271] confirmed independently by Coste[272]\r\nin 1850. By 1848 segmentation had been noted in _Hydra_ and various\r\nhydroids, in acalephs, in starfish, polyzoa, nematodes, rotifers,\r\nleeches, oligochaetes, polychaetes, in most groups of molluscs and\r\narthropods, and in all the vertebrate classes.[273]\r\n\r\nThe process was at first held to be merely one of yolk-division, or\r\n_Dotterfurchung_, and its details were by most interpreted in the light\r\nof the Schleiden-Schwann theory of cell-formation.\r\n\r\nThe first steps towards a truer conception of the process seem to have\r\nbeen taken by Bergmann, who in 1841[274] called attention to the presence\r\nof nuclei in the segmentation-spheres of the frog's egg, and by Bagge in\r\nthe same year, who observed that division of the nuclei preceded the\r\nmultiplication of the segmentation spheres.[275] He considered the nuclei\r\nto be anucleate cells, and the same view was taken by Koelliker in\r\n1843.[276] Next year, however, in his classical paper on Cephalopod\r\ndevelopment[277] Koelliker came to the opinion that they were really\r\nnuclei. He showed that segmentation was brought about by cell-division,\r\nthat between \"total\" and \"partial\" segmentation there was a difference\r\nof degree and not of kind, and that the cells of the body were formed by\r\ndivision of the segmentation spheres. He held, however, that the nuclei\r\nmultiplied endogenously and not by division. The division of nuclei was\r\nobserved by Coste in 1846.[278] Leydig in 1848[279] took the necessary step\r\nin advance and maintained that the nuclei as well as the cells increased\r\nalways by division. He was supported by Remak, who in a paper of\r\n1852,[280] and more fully in his monumental _Untersuchungen ueber die\r\nEntwickelung der Wirbelthiere_ (Berlin, 1850-55), proved that in the\r\nfrog's egg at least segmentation was a simple process of cell-division,\r\ninitiated always by division of the nucleus.[281]\r\n\r\nOne point Remak left undecided--the fate of the _Keimblaeschen_ or\r\negg-nucleus. It was generally held, even so late as the 'fifties, that\r\nthe egg-nucleus disappeared just before segmentation began--Bischoff\r\nclung to this belief even in 1877.[282] Though Barry had held in 1839 that\r\nthe egg-nucleus does not disappear in segmentation, J. Mueller seems to\r\nhave been the first actually to prove that it forms by division the\r\nnuclei of the first two segmentation spheres. He furnished the\r\ndemonstration in the egg of _Entoconcha mirabilis_,[283] and his paper was\r\nknown to Remak, who could not, however, observe a similar division of\r\nthe egg-nucleus in the frog. Mueller's discovery was confirmed for\r\n_Oceania armata_ by Gegenbaur,[284] and for _Notommata sieboldii_ by\r\nLeydig.[285]\r\n\r\nIn 1854 Virchow,[286] previously a supporter of Schwann, crystallised the\r\nnew views in the famous phrase--_Omnis cellula e cellula_--and gave wide\r\npublicity to them in his classical lectures on Cellular Pathology,\r\ndelivered in 1858.[287] The new doctrine of cell-formation was also taught\r\nby Leydig[7] in his text-book of histology, published in 1857.\r\n\r\nThe Schleiden-Schwann theory of the origin of cells by generation in a\r\ncytoblastem was now definitely overthrown.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the protoplasmic content of the cell was brought into\r\nprominence through the work of Dujardin,[289] Purkinje,[290] Cohen[291] and\r\nMax Schultze.[292] The last-named in 1861 proposed a definition of the\r\ncell which might be accepted at the present day. \"A cell,\" he wrote, \"is\r\na little blob of protoplasm containing a nucleus\" (p. 11).\r\n\r\n    [238] _Theoria generationis_, Halae, 1759.\r\n\r\n    [239] See J. v.

There resulted a certain loss of feeling for\r\nthe problems of form. The organism was seen no longer as a cunningly\r\nconstructed complex of organs, tissues and cells; it had become a mere\r\ncell-aggregate; the higher elements of form were disregarded and\r\nignored.\r\n\r\nWe have seen this physiological attitude expressed with the utmost\r\nclearness by the founder of the cell-theory himself; we shall see the\r\nsame attitude taken up by most of his successors. Thus Vogt, who was\r\nlater to become one of the protagonists of materialism in Germany,\r\ndeveloped in his memoir on the embryology of _Coregonus_[293] the theory\r\nof the independent or individual life of the cell. \"Each cell,\" he\r\nwrote, \"represents in some measure a separate organism, and while their\r\ndevelopment necessarily conforms to the general plan and the particular\r\ntendencies of the parent organism, they nevertheless each follow their\r\nown particular tendency and do not lose their independence until, by\r\nreason of the metamorphoses which they undergo, they lose their cellular\r\nnature\" (p. 275).\r\n\r\nAnd again, \"... we are obliged to admit the existence in the cell of an\r\nindependent life, which makes its development self-sufficient.... Each\r\ncell consequently represents a little independent organism, which\r\nassimilates foreign substances, builds them up, and rejects those that\r\nare useless; from this point of view the embryo can be compared up to a\r\ncertain point with a zoophyte stock, of which each polyp, while living\r\nits own independent life, is yet incorporated in the common corm, which\r\nimpresses its distinctive character upon every polyp\" (p. 293).\r\n\r\nClassical expression was given to the \"colonial theory\" of the organism\r\nby Virchow in his lectures on \"Cellular Pathology.\"[294] For Virchow the\r\norganism resolves itself into an assemblage of living centres, the\r\ncells; the organism has no real existence as a unity, for there is no\r\none single centre from which its activities are ruled. Even the nervous\r\nsystem, which appears to act as a co-ordinating centre, is itself an\r\naggregate of discrete cells. \"A tree is a body of definite and orderly\r\ncomposition, the ultimate elements of which, in every part of it, in\r\nleaf and root, in stem and flower, are cellular elements--so also are\r\nanimal forms. _Every animal is a sum of vital units_, each of which\r\npossesses the full characteristics of life. The character and the unity\r\nof life cannot be found in one definite point of a higher organisation,\r\nfor example in the brain of man, but only in the definite, constantly\r\nrecurring disposition shown individually by each single element. It\r\nfollows that the composition of the major organism, the so-called\r\nindividual, must be likened to a kind of social arrangement or society,\r\nin which a number of separate existences are dependent upon one another,\r\nin such a way, however, that each element possesses its own particular\r\nactivity, and, although receiving the stimulus to activity from the\r\nother elements, carries out its own task by its own powers\" (2nd ed.,\r\npp. 12-13).\r\n\r\nAnalysis, decomposition, or disintegration of the organism is here\r\npushed to its extreme point, and the problem of recomposition, synthesis\r\nand co-ordination shirked or forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe harmful influence of the cell-theory upon morphology did not pass\r\nunnoticed by the broader-minded zoologists of the day. Virchow's earlier\r\npaper[295] on the application of the cell-theory to physiology and\r\npathology called forth a vigorous protest from Reichert,[296] who\r\ndiscussed in a very instructive way the contrast between the older\r\n\"systematic\" and the newer \"atomistic\" attitude to living Nature.\r\n\r\nIs it really true, he asks, that the cell is the dominant element in all\r\norganisation; is the cell comparable in importance to the atom of the\r\nchemists; or is it not rather the servant of a higher regulatory power?\r\nJohannes Mueller, who was Reichert's master, had in his _Physiology_[297]\r\nargued splendidly for the existence of a creative force which guides and\r\nrules development, and brings to pass that unity and harmony of\r\ncomposition which distinguish living things from inorganic products.\r\nReichert sought in vain in the writings of the biological \"atomists\" for\r\nany smallest recognition of these broader characteristics of living\r\nthings upon which Mueller had rightly laid stress. For the atomists the\r\ncell was the only element of form; they ignored the combination of cells\r\nto form tissues, of tissues to form organs, of organs to form an\r\norganism. For the morphologists the cell was one element among many, and\r\nthe lowest of all.\r\n\r\nThe difference of attitude is clearly shown if we consider from the two\r\npoints of view a complicated organ-system such as the central nervous\r\nsystem. The atomist sees in this a mere aggregate of cells or at the\r\nmost of groups of cells. \"The morphologist,\" on the other hand, \"sees in\r\nthe central nervous system a _proximate_ element in the composition of\r\nthe body--a primitive organ. From this point of view he apprehends and\r\njudges its morphological relations with, in the first place, the other\r\nco-ordinated primitive organs in the system as a whole; in all this the\r\ncells remain in the background, and have nothing to do directly with the\r\ndetermination of these morphological relations\" (p. 6). Within the\r\nnervous system there are separate organs which stand to one another in a\r\ndefinite morphological and functional relationship. These organs are, it\r\nis true, composed of cells; but between the form and connections of\r\nthese organs and the cells which compose them there is no direct and\r\nnecessary relation (p. 6). It is true that the cell is the ultimate\r\nelement of organic form, and that all development takes place by\r\nmultiplication and form-change of cells. Yet is the cell in all this not\r\nindependent of the unity of the developing embryo, and what the cells\r\nproduce, they produce, so to speak, not of their own free will, nor by\r\nchance, but under the guiding influence of the unity of the whole, and\r\nin a certain measure as its agents (p. 7). The atomists will not admit\r\nthe truth of this; they see in development nothing more than a process\r\nof the form-change and multiplication of cells. The full meaning of\r\ndevelopment escapes them, for they take no cognisance of the increasing\r\ncomplexity of the embryo, of the separating-out of tissues, of the\r\nmoulding of organs, of the harmonious adaptation and adjustment of the\r\nparts to form a working whole.\r\n\r\nIn general, the fault of the atomists is that they do not respect the\r\nlimits which Nature herself has prescribed to the process of logical\r\nanalysis and disintegration of the organism; they do not recognise the\r\nexistence of natural and rational units or unities; they forget the one\r\ngreat principle of rational analysis, \"that, by universally valid,\r\ninductive, logical method, natural objects must in all cases be accepted\r\nand dealt with in the combination and concatenation in which they are\r\ngiven\" (p. 10).\r\n\r\nThe atomists at least recognised one natural organic element, the cell;\r\nthe materialistic physiologists of the time resolved even this unity\r\ninto an aggregate of inorganic compounds, and regarded the organism\r\nitself as nothing but a vastly complicated physico-chemical mechanism.\r\nFrom this point of view morphology had no right of existence, and we\r\nfind Ludwig, one of the foremost of the materialistic school,\r\nmaintaining that morphology was of no scientific importance, that it was\r\nnothing more than an artistic game, interesting enough, but completely\r\nsuperseded and robbed of all value by the advance of materialistic\r\nphysiology.[298]\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, morphologists did not accept this rather contemptuous\r\nestimate of their science, but held firmly to the morphological\r\nattitude. So Leuckart in his reply to Ludwig, so Rathke in a letter to\r\nLeuckart published in that reply, so Reichert in his _Bericht_, so J. V.\r\nCarus in his _System der thierischen Morphologie_,[299] upheld the\r\nvalidity, the independence, of morphological methods. Leuckart and\r\nRathke called attention to the absolute impossibility of explaining by\r\nmaterialistic physiology the unity of plan underlying the diversity of\r\nanimal form. J. V. Carus, who was convinced of the validity of\r\nphysiological methods within their proper sphere, drew a sharp\r\ndistinction between systematics and morphology on the one hand, and\r\nphysiology on the other. Physiology had nothing to do with the problems\r\nof form at all; its business was to study the physical and chemical\r\nprocesses which lay at the base of all vital activities. Morphology, on\r\nits part, had to accept form as something given, and to study the\r\nabstract relations of forms to one another. \"On this point,\" he writes,\r\n\"stress is to be laid, that morphology has to do with animal form as\r\nsomething _given_ by Nature, that though it follows out the changes\r\ntaking place during the development of an animal and tries to explain\r\nthem, it does not enquire after the conditions whose necessary and\r\nphysical consequence this form actually is\" (p. 24). He expressed indeed\r\na pious hope (p. 25) that physiology might one day be so far advanced\r\nthat it could attempt with some hope of success to discover the\r\nphysico-chemical determinism of form, but this remained with him merely\r\na pious hope. Reichert, in his _Bericht_, applied to the rather wild\r\ntheorisings of the physiologist Ludwig the same clear commonsense\r\ncriticism that he bestowed on the other \"atomists.\"\r\n\r\nIt would take too long to describe the great development that\r\nmaterialistic physiology took at this time, and to show how the\r\nseparation of morphology from physiology, which originally took place\r\naway back in the 17th century, had by this time become almost absolute.\r\nThe years towards the end of the first half of the century marked indeed\r\nthe beginning of the classical period as well of physiology as of\r\ndogmatic materialism. Moleschott and Buchner popularised materialism in\r\nGermany in the 'fifties, while Ludwig, du Bois Reymond and von Helmholtz\r\nbegan to apply the methods of physics to physiology. In France, Claude\r\nBernard was at the height of his activity, rivalled by workers almost as\r\ngreat. The doctrine of the conservation of energy was established about\r\nthis same time.\r\n\r\nBetween the cell-theory on the one side, and physiology on the other, it\r\nwas a wonder that morphology kept alive at all. The only thing that\r\npreserved it was the return to the sound Cuvierian tradition which had\r\nbeen made by many zoologists in the 'thirties and 'forties. It is a\r\nsignificant fact that this return to the functional attitude coincided\r\nin the main with the rise of marine zoology, and that the man who most\r\ntypically preserved the Cuvierian attitude, H. Milne-Edwards, was also\r\none of the first and most consistent of marine biologists. Milne-Edwards\r\ndescribes in his interesting _Rapport sur les Progres recents des\r\nSciences zoologiques en France_ (Paris) 1867, how \"About the year 1826,\r\ntwo young naturalists, formed in the schools of Cuvier, Geoffroy and\r\nMajendie, considered that zoology, after having been purely descriptive\r\nor systematic and then anatomical, ought to take on a more physiological\r\ncharacter; they considered that it was not enough to observe living\r\nobjects in the repose of death, and that it was desirable to get to\r\nunderstand the organism in action, especially when the structure of\r\nthese animals was so different from that of man that the notions\r\nacquired as to the special physiology of man could not properly be\r\napplied to them\" (p. 17). The two young naturalists were H.\r\nMilne-Edwards and V. Audouin. In pursuance of these excellent ideas they\r\nset to work to study the animals of the seashore, producing in 1832-4\r\ntwo volumes of _Recherches pour servir a l'histoire naturelle du\r\nlittoral de la France_. After Audouin's early death A. de Quatrefages\r\nwas associated with Milne-Edwards in this pioneer work, and their\r\nvaliant struggles with insufficient equipment and lack of all laboratory\r\naccommodation, and the rich harvest they reaped, may be read of in\r\nQuatrefage's fascinating account of their journeyings.[300] Note that\r\nthough they called themselves physiologists they meant by physiology\r\nsomething very different from the mere physical and chemical study of\r\nliving things. They were interested, as Cuvier was, primarily in the\r\nproblems of form; they sought to penetrate the relation between form and\r\nfunction; their chief aim was, therefore, the study not of physiology[301]\r\nin the restricted sense, but physiological morphology. As a matter of\r\nfact they produced more taxanomic and anatomical work than work on\r\nphysiological morphology, but this was only natural, since such a wealth\r\nof new forms was disclosed to their gaze. Milne-Edwards' masterly\r\n_Histoire Naturelle des Crustaces_[302] and A. de Quatrefage's _Histoire\r\nNaturelle des Anneles marins et d'eau douce_[303] were typical products of\r\ntheir activity.\r\n\r\nIn the North, men like Sars and Loven were starting to work on the\r\nlittoral fauna of the fjords; in Britain, Edward Forbes was opening up\r\nnew worlds by the use of the dredge; Johannes Mueller was using the\r\ntow-net to gather material for his masterly papers on the metamorphoses\r\nof Echinoderms.[304] Work on the taxonomy and anatomy of marine animals\r\nwas in general in full swing by the 'fifties and 'sixties.\r\n\r\nThis return to Nature and to the sea had a very beneficial effect upon\r\nmorphology, bringing it out from the laboratory to the open air and the\r\nseashore. It saved morphology from formalism and aridity, and in\r\nparticular from a certain narrowness of outlook born of too close\r\nattention paid to the details of microscopical anatomy. It brought\r\nmorphologists face to face again with the wonderful diversity of organic\r\nforms, with the unity of plan underlying that diversity, with the\r\nadmirable adjustment of organ to function and of both to the life of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nMilne-Edwards' theoretical views, as expounded in his _Introduction a la\r\nzoologie generale_ (1851), well reflect this Cuvierian attitude.[305] He\r\nacknowledges himself the debt he owes to Cuvier; \"the further I advance\r\nin the study of the sciences which he cultivated with so sure a hand,\"\r\nhe writes in 1867, \"the more I venerate him.\"\r\n\r\nMilne-Edwards frankly takes up the teleological standpoint, and\r\ninterprets organic forms on the assumption that they are purposive and\r\nrationally constructed. \"To arrive at an understanding of the harmony of\r\nthe organic creation,\" he writes, \"it seemed to me that it would be well\r\nto accept the hypothesis that Nature has gone about her work as we would\r\ndo ourselves according to the light of our own intelligence, if it were\r\ngiven us to produce a similar result. Comparing and studying living\r\nthings as if they were machines created by the industry of man, I have\r\ntried to grasp the manner in which they might have been invented, and\r\nthe principles whose application would have led to the production of\r\nsuch an assemblage of diversified instruments\" (p. 435). The problem is\r\nto discover the laws which rule the diversity of organic forms. The\r\nfirst and most obvious of these laws is the \"law of economy,\" or the law\r\nof unity of type. Nature, as Cuvier pointed out, has not had recourse to\r\nall the possible forms and combinations of organs; she appears to work\r\nwith a limited number of types and to get the greatest possible\r\ndiversity out of these by varying the proportions of the constitutive\r\nmaterials of structure. Within the limits of each type Nature has\r\nbrought about diversity by raising her creatures to different degrees of\r\nperfection. This is the second law of organic form, and it is this law\r\nthat Milne-Edwards chiefly elaborates. Degrees of perfection mean for\r\nhim, as for Aristotle, primarily degrees of perfection of function, but\r\nsince structure is necessarily in close relation with function,\r\nperfection of function brings in its train increased perfection of\r\norganisation. This can only be attained by a division of labour[306] among\r\nthe organs and by their consequent differentiation. An animal is like a\r\nworkshop where some complicated product is manufactured, and the organs\r\nare like the workmen. Each workman has his own special piece of work to\r\ndo, at which he becomes thoroughly expert; and the finished product is\r\nmanufactured more rapidly and efficiently by the co-operation of workers\r\neach skilled in one department than it would be if each workman had to\r\nproduce the whole. Applied to the organism this principle of the\r\ndivision of labour means the differentiating out of the separate\r\nfunctions, their localisation in different parts of the organism, and\r\ntheir co-ordination to produce a combined result.\r\n\r\nThis differentiation of functions implies a corresponding\r\ndifferentiation of organs, but it is functional differentiation which\r\nalways takes the lead. \"Where division of labour has not been introduced\r\ninto the organism there must exist a great simplicity of structure. But\r\njust as uniformity in the functions of the different parts of the body\r\nimplies a uniformity in their mode of constitution, so diversity in\r\nfunction must be accompanied by particularities in structure; and, in\r\nconsequence also, the number of dissimilar parts must be augmented and\r\nthe complication of the machine increased\" (p. 463). Since function\r\ncomes before form there is not always a special organ for every\r\nfunction. \"It is a grave error to believe that a particular function can\r\nbe performed only by one and the same organ. Nature can arrive at the\r\ndesired result by various ways, and when we look down through the animal\r\nkingdom from the highest to the lowest forms we see that the function\r\ndoes not disappear even when the special instrument provided for the\r\npurpose in the higher types ceases to exist\" (p 470).\r\n\r\nNature, holding fast to the law of economy, does not even always create\r\na new organ for a new function; she may simply adapt an undifferentiated\r\npart to special functions, or she may even convert to other uses an\r\norgan already specialised (p. 464). So, for example, the function of\r\nrespiration is in the lowest animals diffused indifferently over the\r\nwhole surface of the body, and only as organisation advances is it\r\nlocalised in special organs, such as gills. Now suppose that Nature\r\nwishes to adapt a fish, which breathes by gills, to life in the air; she\r\ndoes not create an organ specially for this purpose, but utilises the\r\nmoist gill-chamber (_e.g._, in _Anabas scandens_), modifying it in\r\ncertain ways so that the fish can take advantage of the oxygen it\r\ncontains. But this gill-chamber lung is at best a makeshift, and when\r\nshe comes to the more definitely terrestrial Amphibia Nature gives up\r\nthe attempt to use the gill-chamber as a lung, and creates a new organ,\r\nthe true vertebrate lung, specially adapted for breathing air (p. 475).\r\n\r\nBut whatever means Nature adopts, her aim is always the same--to\r\nspecialise, to differentiate, to produce diversity from uniformity.\r\n\r\nDifferentiation not only raises the level of organisation; it usually\r\nalso takes the direction of adaptation to particular habits of life, and\r\nthis is perhaps the most fruitful cause of diversity. Everywhere we find\r\nanimals specialised in adaptation to their environment--to life in air\r\nor water, or on land--and many of their most striking differences are\r\ndue to this cause. But adaptation may also act in reducing diversity,\r\nfor there necessarily occur many instances of parallel adaptation or\r\nconvergence. So we get the extraordinary parallelism between the\r\nfamilies of marsupials and the orders of placentals,[307] the remarkable\r\nsimilarity between the respiratory organs of land-crabs and\r\nair-breathing fish--to mention only two out of an immense range of\r\nanalogous facts.\r\n\r\nThe last cause of diversity that Milne-Edwards adduces is what he calls\r\na \"borrowing\" of peculiarities of structure from another systematic\r\ngroup. Thus, \"among reptiles, the tortoises seem to have borrowed from\r\nbirds some of their characteristic features of organisation; and among\r\nthe sauroid fishes the piscine type seems to have been influenced by the\r\ntype from which reptiles are derived\" (p. 479). So many riddles that, a\r\nlittle later on, stimulated the ingenuity of the evolutionists!\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the factors which Milne-Edwards considered adequate to\r\nexplain the rich variety of animal forms. We cannot do better than quote\r\nhis own summary of his doctrine:--\"To sum up, then, the great\r\ndifferences introduced by Nature into the constitution of animals seem\r\nto depend essentially upon the existence of a certain number of general\r\nplans or distinct types, upon the perfecting in various degrees either\r\nof the whole or of parts of each of these structural plans, upon the\r\nadaptation of each type to varied conditions of existence, and upon the\r\nsecondary imitation of foreign types by certain derivatives of each\r\nparticular type\" (p. 480).\r\n\r\nWe have laid stress on the fact that Milne-Edwards put function before\r\nform, for this is the mark of the true Cuvierian. With it goes the\r\nbelief that Nature forms new parts to meet new requirements, that she is\r\nnot limited, as Geoffroy thought, to a definite number of \"materials of\r\norganisation,\" but can produce others at need. Cuvier held, for example,\r\nthat many of the muscles and even the bones of fish were peculiar to\r\nthem, and without homologues in the other Vertebrates, having been\r\ncreated by Nature for special ends.[308] So, too, Johannes Mueller, who in\r\nmany ways and not least in his sane vitalism was a follower of the\r\nCuvierian tradition, recognised that many of the complicated cartilages\r\nin the skull of Cyclostomes were specially formed for the important\r\nfunction of sucking, and had no equivalent in other fish.[309]\r\n\r\nSo, too, the embryologists after Cuvier often came across instances of\r\nthe special formation of parts to meet temporary needs. Thus Reichert\r\ninterpreted the \"palatine\" and \"pterygoid,\" which are formed in the\r\nmouth of the newt larva by a fusion of conical teeth, as special\r\nadaptations to enable the little larva to lead a carnivorous life.[310]\r\n\r\nNot many years after the publication of Milne-Edwards' _Introduction a\r\nla zoologie generale_ (1851) there appeared a book by H. G. Bronn in\r\nwhich was offered a very similar analysis of organic diversity. The\r\ncurious thing was that Bronn approached the problem from quite a\r\ndifferent standpoint, from the standpoint, indeed, of\r\n_Naturphilosophie_. Of this the title of the book is itself sufficient\r\nproof--_Morphologische Studien ueber die Gestaltungs-gesetze der\r\nNaturkoerper ueberhaupt und der organischen insbesondere_ (Leipzig and\r\nHeidelberg, 1858).[311] The linking up of organic with inorganic form is\r\ncharacteristic; there is much talk, too, in the book of _Urstoffe_ and\r\n_Urkraefte_, but underlying the _Naturphilosophie_ we can trace the same\r\nCuvierian treatment of form, and see crystallise out laws of progressive\r\ndevelopment that bear no small analogy with the laws established by\r\nMilne-Edwards.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bronn, the ideal fundamental form of the plant is an ovoid\r\nor strobiloid[312] body, for a plant reaches out in two directions in\r\nsearch of food--towards the sun and towards the earth. Animals differ\r\nfrom plants in being endowed with sensation and mobility (_cf._\r\nAristotle and Cuvier), and it is this characteristic that gives them\r\ntheir distinctive form. The main types of animal form--the Amorphozoa,\r\nActinozoa, and Hemisphenozoa--are essentially adaptations to particular\r\nmodes of locomotion. Animals either are fixed, or they move in all\r\ndirections without reference to any definite axis, or they move in one\r\nmain direction.\r\n\r\nThe Amorphozoa or shapeless animals include many of the Protozoa and\r\nsponges; they have no typical form, and most of them are sessile. The\r\nActinozoa include such animals as the Coelentera, which are fixed, and\r\nthe Echinoderms, which have a central point and move indifferently along\r\nany radial axis; their form differs from the strobiloid mainly in having\r\nradiate rather than spiral symmetry. The Hemisphenozoa, or bilaterally\r\nsymmetrical animals, include all those that habitually move forward;\r\nthey have a front end and a hind end, a dorsal surface and a ventral,\r\nand the mouth, sense-organs and \"brain\" are concentrated in the front\r\nend to form a head--all in direct adaptation to this forward movement;\r\nthey make up the vast majority of animals.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental forms of living things are, however, merely so many\r\nthemes on which a multitude of further variations are woven, through the\r\naction of the laws which rule the detail of organic diversities. These\r\nfurther laws may be set down under four main heads. Under the first\r\ncomes the law of the existence of certain fundamentally distinct\r\nstructural types, which are distinguished from one another by their\r\nground-form, by the number of organ-systems, and by the number of\r\nhomotypic organs they possess, but principally by the relative position\r\nof the organs to one another (principle of connections). The form and\r\nconnections of the nervous system are of particular importance in\r\ndistinguishing the types (_cf._ Cuvier). The second factor in the\r\ndiversity of organic form is the action of certain laws of progressive\r\ndevelopment[313] (_Entwickelungsgesetze_), which bear the same relation to\r\nthe development of the animal kingdom as the laws of individual\r\ndevelopment bear to the development of the embryo, for organs appear in\r\nthe different animal series in much the same order and manner as they\r\ndevelop in the individual. These laws are (1) progressive\r\ndifferentiation of functions and organs; (2) numerical reduction of\r\nserially repeated parts; (3) concentration of functions and their organs\r\nin particular parts of the body; (4) centralisation of organ-systems and\r\nparts of such, so that they come to depend upon one central organ; (5)\r\ninternalisation of the \"noblest\" organs, unless these are necessarily\r\nexternal, and (6) increase in size of the whole or of parts. Of these\r\nthe law of differentiation is by far the most important, and most of the\r\nothers are in a sense merely special cases of this fundamental law. To\r\nthis law of differentiation is due the increase in complexity or\r\nperfection of organisation which is shown by all the animal series.\r\nBronn himself recognised the great similarity of this law of progressive\r\ndifferentiation to Milne-Edwards' principle of the division of labour;\r\nhe seems, however, to have arrived at it independently.\r\n\r\nBronn's third factor in the production of variety of form is adaptation\r\nto environment, or better, functional response to environment. Bronn\r\ngives an excellent account of adaptational modifications and calls\r\nattention, just as Milne-Edwards did, to the numerous analogies of\r\nstructure which adaptation brings about. He works out the interesting\r\nview that there is some connection between classificatory groups and\r\nadaptational forms, especially such as are connected with the function\r\nof locomotion:--\"Based upon a common characteristic method of locomotion\r\nare whole or nearly whole sub-phyla (Hexapoda), classes (mammals and\r\nreptiles, birds, fishes, gastropods, pteropods, brachiopods, Bryozoa,\r\nRotifera, jelly-fish, polypes, sponges), sub-classes (mobile and\r\nimmobile lamellibranchs, echinoderms, walking and swimming Crustacea,\r\nparasitic and free-living worms, and so on), often, however, only orders\r\nand quite small groups (snakes, eels, bats, sepias, medusae, etc.)\" (p.\r\n141).\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of the 'forties and 'fifties that transcendental\r\nanatomy, along with Nature-philosophy, went rather out of fashion, its\r\nfalse simplicities and premature generalisations being overwhelmed by\r\nthe flood of new discoveries. A few stalwarts indeed upheld\r\ntranscendental views. We have already discussed the morphological system\r\nbuilt up by Richard Owen in the late 'forties, a system transcendental\r\nin its main lines. We have seen the vertebral theory of the skull still\r\nmaintained in the 'fifties by such men as Reichert and Koelliker, and we\r\nfind J. V. Carus in 1853[314] taking it as almost conclusively proved.[315]\r\n\r\nWe may mention, too, as showing clear marks of the influence of\r\ntranscendental ideas, L. Agassiz's work on the principles of\r\nclassification.[316] And Serres, who was Geoffroy's chief disciple,\r\nrecanted not a whit of his doctrine of recapitulation, but re-affirmed\r\nand expanded it from time to time, and particularly in a lengthy memoir\r\npublished in 1860.[317] But in general we may say that pure morphology in\r\nthe Geoffroyan or Okenian sense was becoming gradually discredited. A\r\ncurious indication of this is seen in the fact that not only the idea\r\nbut the very word \"Archetype\" came to be regarded with suspicion. Thus\r\neven J. V. Carus, who had much affinity with the transcendentalists,\r\nwrote of the vertebrate archetype (which he took over almost bodily from\r\nOwen)--\"It may here be observed that this schema may be used as a\r\nmethodological help, but it is not to be placed in the foreground\"\r\n(_loc. cit._, p. 395). Huxley, who was definitely a follower of von\r\nBaer, was much more outspoken with regard to ideal types. In an\r\nimportant memoir on the general anatomy of the Gastropoda and\r\nCephalopoda,[318] he set himself the task of reducing all their complex\r\nforms to one type. In summing up, he writes:--\"From all that has been\r\nstated, I think that it is now possible to form a notion of the\r\narchetype of the Cephalous Mollusca, and I beg it to be understood that\r\nin using this term, I make no reference to any real or imaginary 'ideas'\r\nupon which animal forms are modelled. All that I mean is the conception\r\nof a form embodying the most general propositions that can be affirmed\r\nrespecting the Cephalous Mollusca, standing in the same relation to them\r\nas the diagram to a geometrical theorem, and like it, at once imaginary\r\nand true\" (i., p. 176). Again, in his Croonian lecture on the theory of\r\nthe vertebrate skull, he remarks that a general diagram of the skull\r\ncould easily be given. \"There is no harm,\" he continues, \"in calling\r\nsuch a convenient diagram the 'Archetype' of the skull, but I prefer to\r\navoid a word whose connotation is so fundamentally opposed to the spirit\r\nof modern science\" (_Sci. Memoirs_, vol. i., p. 571).\r\n\r\nIt is instructive to find that between Serres and Milne-Edwards there\r\nexisted the same antagonism as between von Baer and the German\r\ntranscendentalists. Milne-Edwards was a constant critic of the law of\r\nparallelism which Serres continued to uphold with little modification\r\nfor over thirty years, just as von Baer was a critic of that form of the\r\ndoctrine which was current in the early part of the century. As early as\r\n1833, Milne-Edwards, through his studies of crustacean development,[319]\r\nhad come to the conclusion, independently of von Baer, that development\r\nalways proceeded from the general to the special; that class characters\r\nappeared before family characters, generic characters before specific.\r\nIn an interesting paper published in 1844,[320] he discussed the relation\r\nof this law of development to the problems of classification, and\r\narrived at results almost identical with those set forth by von Baer in\r\nhis Fifth Scholion.\r\n\r\nLike von Baer he rejected completely the theory of parallelism and the\r\ndoctrine of the scale of beings; like von Baer he held that the type of\r\norganisation--of which there are several--is manifested in the very\r\nearliest stages and becomes increasingly specialised throughout the\r\ncourse of further development; like von Baer, too, he sketched a\r\nclassification based upon embryological characters.\r\n\r\nThese views were further developed in his volume of 1851, and also in\r\nhis _Rapport_ of 1867.\r\n\r\nThey brought him into conflict with his confrere in the Academy of\r\nSciences, Etienne Serres, who in a number of papers published in the\r\n'thirties and 'forties,[321] and particularly in his comprehensive memoir\r\nof 1860, still maintained the theory of parallelism and the doctrine of\r\nthe absolute unity of type. His memoir of 1860 shows how completely\r\nSerres was under the domination of transcendental ideas. Much of it\r\nindeed goes back to Oken. \"The animal kingdom,\" he writes, \"may be\r\nconsidered in its entirety as a single ideal and complex being\" (p.\r\n141). His views have become a little more complicated since his first\r\nexposition of them in 1827, and he has been forced to modify in some\r\nrespects the rigour of his doctrine. But he still holds fast to the main\r\nthesis of transcendentalism--the absolute unity of plan of all animals,\r\nvertebrate and invertebrate alike,[322] the gradual perfecting of\r\norganisation from monad to man, the repetition in the embryogeny of the\r\nhigher animals of the \"zoogeny\" of the lower.\r\n\r\nHe recognised, however, that the idea of a simple scale of beings is\r\nonly an abstraction, and that the true repetition is of organs rather\r\nthan of organisms. He was willing even to admit, at least in the later\r\npages of his memoir, that there might be not one animal series but\r\nseveral parallel series, as had been suggested by Isidore Geoffroy St\r\nHilaire (p. 749). In general, his views are now less dogmatic than they\r\nwere in his earlier writings, but they are not for all that changed in\r\nany essential. For, in summing up his main results, he writes, \"The\r\nwhole animal kingdom can in some measure be regarded ideally as a single\r\nanimal, which, in the course of formation and metamorphosis in its\r\ndiverse manifestations, here and there arrests its own development, and\r\nthus determines at each point of interruption, by the very state it has\r\nreached, the distinctive characters of the phyla, the classes, families,\r\ngenera, and species\" (p. 833).[323]\r\n\r\nTo settle the dispute pending between two of its most illustrious\r\nmembers, the Academy proposed in 1853, as the subject of one of its\r\nprizes, \"the positive determination of the resemblances and differences\r\nin the comparative development of Vertebrates and Invertebrates.\" A\r\nmemoir was presented the next year by Lereboullet[324] which met with the\r\napproval of the Academy in so far as its statements of fact were\r\nconcerned, but seemed to them to require amplification in its\r\ntheoretical part. But even in this memoir Lereboullet was able to show\r\nthat the balance of evidence was greatly in favour of Milne-Edwards'\r\nviews, and his general conclusions in 1854 were that \"in the presence of\r\nsuch fundamental differences, one is obliged to give up the idea of one\r\nsingle plan in the formation of animals; while, on the contrary, the\r\nexistence of diverse plans or types is clearly demonstrated by all the\r\nfacts\" (p. 79). To fulfil the Academy's requirements, Lereboullet\r\ncontinued his work, and in 1861-63 he published a series of elaborate\r\nmonographs[325] on the embryology of the trout, the lizard and the\r\npond-snail _Lymnaea_, and rounded off his work with a full discussion[326]\r\nof the theoretical questions involved. In this considered and\r\nauthoritative judgment he completely disposed of Serres' theories of the\r\nunity of plan and the unity of genetic formation. Except in the very\r\nearliest stages of oogenesis there is no real similarity between the\r\ndevelopment of a Zoophyte, a Mollusc, an Articulate and a Vertebrate,\r\nbut each is stamped from the beginning with the characteristics of its\r\ntype. The lower animals are not, and cannot possibly be the permanent\r\nembryos of the higher animals. \"The results which I have obtained,\" he\r\nwrites, \"are diametrically opposed to the theory of the zoological\r\nseries constituted by stages of increasing perfection, a theory which\r\ntries to demonstrate in the embryonic phases of the higher animals a\r\nrepetition of the forms which characterise the lower animals, and which\r\nhas led to the assertion that the latter are permanent embryos of the\r\nformer. The embryo of a Vertebrate shows the vertebrate type from the\r\nvery beginning, and retains this type throughout the whole course of its\r\ndevelopment; it never is, and never can be, either a Mollusc or an\r\nArticulate\" (xx., p. 54).\r\n\r\n\"We are led to establish ... as the general result of our researches,\r\nthe existence of several types, and, consequently, of different plans,\r\nin the development of animals. These different types are manifested from\r\nthe very beginning of embryonic life; the characters distinguishing them\r\nare therefore primordial, and we can say with M. Milne-Edwards that\r\n_everything goes to prove that the distinction established by Nature\r\nbetween animals belonging to different phyla is a primordial\r\ndistinction_\" (p. 58).\r\n\r\nIn other directions also von Baer's work was confirmed and extended by\r\nlater observers--those parts of it particularly that had reference to\r\nthe germ-layer theory, and to the concept of histological\r\ndifferentiation. His germ-layer theory was accepted in its main lines by\r\nRathke, Bischoff and Lereboullet, and applied by them to the multitude\r\nof new facts they discovered. Rathke, in particular, was a firm upholder\r\nof the doctrine, and made considerable use of it in his writings.[327]\r\nEven before the publication of von Baer's book he had interpreted in\r\nterms of the germ-layer theory sketched by his friend Pander the\r\nsplitting of the blastoderm which occurs in the early development of\r\n_Astacus_, whereby there are formed a serous and a mucous layer, one\r\ninside the other--like the coats of an onion, to use his own expressive\r\nphrase.[328]\r\n\r\nAn ingenious application of the Pander-Baer theory was made by Huxley,\r\nwho compared the outer and inner cell-layers which form the groundwork\r\nof the Coelentera with the serous and mucous layers of the vertebrate\r\ngerm.[329] He laid stress, it is true, rather on the physiological than on\r\nthe morphological resemblance. \"A complete identity of structure,\" he\r\nwrites, \"connects the 'foundation membranes' of the Medusae with the\r\ncorresponding organs in the rest of the series; and it is curious to\r\nremark, that throughout, the outer and inner membranes appear to bear\r\nthe same physiological relation to one another as do the serous and\r\nmucous layers of the germ; the outer becoming developed into the\r\nmuscular system, and giving rise to the organs of offence and defence;\r\nthe inner, on the other hand, appearing to be more closely subservient\r\nto the purposes of nutrition and generation\" (p. 24). Von Baer had\r\nalready hinted at this homology in the second volume of his\r\n_Entwickelungsgeschichte_ (1837), where he says with reference to the\r\nseparation of the blastoderm of the chick into two layers. \"Yet\r\noriginally there are not two distinct or even separable layers, it is\r\nrather the two surfaces of the germ which show this differentiation,\r\njust as polyps show the same contrast of an external surface and an\r\ninternal digestive surface. In between the two layers there is in our\r\ngerm as in the polyp an indifferent mass\" (p. 67). The terms ectoderm\r\nand entoderm were introduced by Allman[330] in 1853 for the two\r\ncell-layers in the Hydrozoa.\r\n\r\nRemak is the second great name in the history of the germ-layer theory.\r\nHe had the great advantage over von Baer of being able to make use of\r\nthe cell-theory in interpreting the formation of the germ-layers.\r\nMicroscopical technique also had been greatly improved since 1828.[331]\r\n\r\nRemak's greatest service was that he put the germ-layer theory in direct\r\nrelation with the cell-theory by demonstrating the cellular continuity\r\nfrom egg-cell to tissue, and by showing that each germ-layer possessed\r\ndistinctive histological characteristics. Hardly less important was his\r\nclear marking-off of the \"middle layer\" as a separate and distinct layer\r\nof the germ. He it was who introduced the modern conception of the\r\nmesoderm, and cleared up the confusion in which Pander and von Baer had\r\nleft the organs formed between the serous and the mucous layer. Remak's\r\nmiddle layer was a different thing from Pander's ill-defined\r\n\"vessel-layer\"; it included and unified from a new point of view the\r\n\"vessel\" and \"muscle\" layers of von Baer.\r\n\r\nThere are in the unincubated blastoderm of the chick, according to\r\nRemak,[332] two cell-layers, of which the undermost subsequently splits\r\ninto two. Three layers are thus formed--the upper, middle and lower. The\r\nupper layer differentiates into a medullary plate and an epidermic plate\r\n(Remak's _Hornblatt_), and gives origin to the medullary tube with all\r\nits evaginations, and to the skin with all its derivatives and pockets.\r\nIt forms such diverse structures as the brain, the spinal cord, the eye,\r\nthe ear, the mouth, hairs, feathers, nails, sweat-glands, lacrymal\r\nglands, and so forth. All these parts are connected directly or\r\nindirectly with sensation, and the upper germ-layer may accordingly be\r\ncalled the _sensory_ layer. The lower layer gives rise to the epithelium\r\nand the proper tissue of the alimentary canal and its derivatives, as\r\nthe liver, lungs, pancreas, kidneys, thyroid, thymus, etc. These parts\r\nare all concerned in the processes of assimilation and dissimilation,\r\nand the lower layer may accordingly be called the _trophic_ layer. Now\r\nbetween the upper or sensory layer and the lower or trophic layer there\r\nexists, in spite of their very different functions, a close histological\r\nlikeness, for both are essentially epithelial layers. The resemblance is\r\nparticularly strong if we compare the lower layer with the _Hornblatt_\r\nof the upper layer--both consist of epithelial tissue, and of its\r\nderivative, glandular tissue, and form neither vessels nor nerves. The\r\nmiddle layer, on the contrary, forms nerves and muscles, vessels and\r\nconnective tissue, and little or no epithelium. It does not form all the\r\nblood-vessels without exception (and so cannot be called the\r\nvessel-layer), for the blood-vessels of the central nervous system are\r\nin all probability formed from the upper layer. So, too, it does not\r\nform all the nerves and muscles--the optic and auditory nerves and the\r\nnerves and muscles of the iris probably arise in the upper layer. But,\r\nin spite of these exceptions, its general histological character is so\r\nwell defined that it may be contrasted with the other two as\r\npreeminently the layer that forms muscular, nervous, vascular and\r\nconnective tissue. In view of its functional significance, it may be\r\ncalled the _motory_ layer, or better, since it forms also the sexual\r\nglands, the _motor-germinative_ layer. The middle layer, early in its\r\nhistory, shows a division into dorsal plates (_Urwirbelplatten_) and\r\nventral plates (_Seitenplatten_). The former exhibit almost as soon as\r\nthey are formed the characteristic proto-vertebral segmentation, the\r\nlatter split to form the pleuro-peritoneal or body-cavity. Remak\r\ndescribes the latter process as follows:--\"In the region of the trunk,\r\nwhere a greater independence of the fate of the alimentary canal and its\r\nannexes becomes necessary for the voluntary executive organs, the\r\nventral plates undergo a process of splitting, leading to the formation\r\nof the sensitive part of the integument (the _Hautplatten_), the\r\nmuscular part of the alimentary tube (the _Darmfaserplatten_), and the\r\nmother-tissue of the generative organs (the _Mittelplatten_). From the\r\n_Hautplatten_ there develops, without the dorsal plates seeming to take\r\nany part in the process, the rudiment of the extremities\" (p. 79).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Transverse Section of Chick Embryo. (After\r\nRemak.)]\r\n\r\nHis _Darmfaserplatten_ form the nervous and muscular tissue of the\r\nalimentary canal and its dependencies, and also the heart; the\r\n_Hautplatten_ form the general body-wall (exclusive of the skin) and the\r\nappendages. In the embryo they line the amniotic cavity. The skeleton\r\nand peripheral nerves originate wholly within the middle layer.\r\n\r\nRemak's conception of the relations of the three germ-layers to one\r\nanother and to the body-cavity is well illustrated in Fig. 12.\r\n\r\nIn his germ-layer theory Remak's standpoint is histological rather than\r\nmorphological. The distinction which he draws between the sensory and\r\ntrophic layers on the one hand, and the motor-germinative layer on the\r\nother, is entirely a histological one. The greater part of his book,\r\nindeed, is devoted to a study of the histogenesis of the different\r\norgans of the body; he is bent chiefly upon unravelling the part which\r\neach germ-layer takes in the formation of each tissue and organ.\r\n\r\nHis generalisation that two of the germ-layers give rise exclusively or\r\nalmost exclusively to one kind of tissue excited great interest at the\r\ntime, and gave the direction to histogenetic research for quite a number\r\nof years, though in the end it turned out to be insufficiently founded.\r\n\r\nThough Remak's germ-layer theory had thus principally a histological\r\norientation, it laid down the main lines of the modern morphological\r\ntreatment of the germ-layers.\r\n\r\n    [293] _Embryologie des Salmones_, 1842.\r\n\r\n    [294] _Die Cellularpathologie in ihrer Begruendung auf\r\n    physiologische und pathologische Gewebelehre_, Berlin,\r\n    2nd ed. 1859; Eng. trans., by Chance, 1860.\r\n\r\n    [295] _Arch. path.

When one remembers what powerful\r\narguments for evolution can be drawn from such facts as the unity of\r\nplan and composition and the law of parallelism, one is astonished to\r\nfind that it was not the morphologists at all who founded the theory of\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the noticeable resemblances of animals to one another,\r\nthe possibility of arranging them in a system, the vague perception of\r\nan all-pervading plan of structure, did suggest to many minds the\r\nthought that systematic affinities might be due to blood-relationship.\r\nThus Leibniz considered that the cat tribe might possibly be descended\r\nfrom a common ancestor,[333] and another great philosopher, Immanuel Kant,\r\nwas led by his perception of the unity of type to suggest as possible\r\nthe derivation of the whole organic realm from one parent form, or even\r\nultimately from inorganic matter. In the course of his masterly\r\ndiscussion of mechanism and teleology,[334] he writes, \"The agreement of\r\nso many genera of animals in a certain common schema, which appears to\r\nbe fundamental not only in the structure of their bones, but also in the\r\ndisposition of their remaining parts--so that with an admirable\r\nsimplicity of original outline, a great variety of species has been\r\nproduced by the shortening of one member and the lengthening of another,\r\nthe involution of this part and the evolution of that--allows a ray of\r\nhope, however faint, to penetrate into our minds, that here something\r\nmay be accomplished by the aid of the principle of the mechanism of\r\nNature (without which there can be no natural science in general). This\r\nanalogy of forms, which with all their differences seem to have been\r\nproduced according to a common original type, strengthens our suspicions\r\nof an actual relationship between them in their production from a common\r\nparent, through the gradual approximation of one animal-genus to\r\nanother--from those in which the principle of purposes seems to be best\r\nauthenticated, _i.e._, from man down to the polype, and again from this\r\ndown to mosses and lichens, and finally to the lowest stage of Nature\r\nnoticeable by us, viz., to crude matter.\"[335]\r\n\r\nSo, too, Buffon's evolutionism was suggested by his study of the\r\nstructural affinities of animals, and Erasmus Darwin in his _Zoonomia_\r\n(1794) brought forward as one of the strongest proofs of evolution, \"the\r\nessential unity of plan in all warm-blooded animals.\"[336]\r\n\r\nBut, as a matter of historical fact, no morphologist, not even Geoffroy,\r\ndeduced from the facts of his science any comprehensive theory of\r\nevolution. The pre-Darwinian morphologists were comparatively little\r\ninfluenced by the evolution-theories current in their day, and it was in\r\nthe anatomist Cuvier and the embryologist von Baer that the early\r\nevolutionists found their most uncompromising opponents.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, and excepting for the moment the theory of Lamarck,\r\nwe may say that the evolution-theories of the 18th and 19th centuries\r\narose in connection with the transcendental notion of the _Echelle des\r\netres_, or scale of perfection. This notion, which plays so great a part\r\nin the philosophy of Leibniz, was very generally accepted about the\r\nmiddle of the 18th century, and received complete and even exaggerated\r\nexpression from Bonnet and Robinet. Buffon also was influenced by it.\r\nTowards the beginning of the 19th century the idea was taken up eagerly\r\nby the transcendental school and by them given, in their theories of the\r\n\"one animal,\" a more morphological turn. Their recapitulation theory was\r\npart and parcel of the same general idea.\r\n\r\nOne understands how easily the notion of evolution could arise in minds\r\nfilled with the thought of the ideal progression of the whole organic\r\nkingdom towards its crown and microcosm, man. Their theory of\r\nrecapitulation led them to conceive evolution as the developmental\r\nhistory of the one great organism.[337] Many of them wavered between the\r\nconception of evolution as an ideal process, as a _Vorstellungsart_, and\r\nthe conception of it as an historical process. Bonnet, Oken, and the\r\nmajority of the transcendentalists seem to have chosen the former\r\nalternative; Robinet, Treviranus, Tiedemann, Meckel, and a few others\r\nheld evolution to be a real process.\r\n\r\nWe have already in previous chapters[338] briefly noticed the relation of\r\none or two of the transcendental evolution-theories to morphology, and\r\nthere is little more to be said about them here. They had as good as no\r\ninfluence upon morphological theory, nor indeed upon biology in\r\ngeneral.[339] It is different with the theory of Lamarck, which, although\r\nit had little influence upon biological thought during and for long\r\nafter the lifetime of its author, is still at the present day a living\r\nand developing doctrine.\r\n\r\nLamarck's affinity with the transcendentalists was in many ways a close\r\none, but he differed essentially in being before all a systematist. Nor\r\nis the direct influence of the German transcendentalists traceable in\r\nhis work--his spiritual ancestors are the men of his own race, the\r\nmaterialists Condillac and Cabanis, and Buffon, whose friend he was. The\r\nidea of a gradation of all animals from the lowest to the highest was\r\nalways present in Lamarck's mind, and links him up, perhaps through\r\nBuffon, with the school of Bonnet. The idea of the _Echelle des etres_\r\nhad for him much less a morphological orientation than it had even for\r\nthe transcendentalists, for he was lacking almost completely in the\r\nsense for morphology. Lamarck's scientific, as distinguished from his\r\nspeculative work, was exclusively systematic, and it was systematics of\r\na very high order. He introduced many reforms into the general\r\nclassification of animals. He was the first clearly to separate\r\nCrustacea (1799), and a little later (1800) Arachnids, from insects. He\r\nreduced to a certain orderliness the neglected tribes of the\r\nInvertebrates, and wrote what was for long the standard work on their\r\nsystematics--the _Histoire naturelle des Animaux sans Vertebres_\r\n(1816-22). His speculative work on biology is contained in three\r\npublications, the small book entitled _Considerations sur l'organisation\r\ndes corps vivants_ (1802), the larger work of 1809, the _Philosophie\r\nzoologique_, and the introductory matter to his _Animaux sans Vertebres_\r\n(vol. i., 1816).\r\n\r\nIt is no easy matter to give in short compass an account of Lamarck's\r\nbiological philosophy. He is an obscure writer, and often\r\nself-contradictory.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of the _Philosophie zoologique_ Lamarck is largely\r\npre-occupied with the problem of whether species are really distinct, or\r\ndo not rather grade insensibly into one another. As a systematist of\r\nvast experience Lamarck knew how difficult it is in practice to\r\ndistinguish species from varieties. \"The more,\" he writes, \"we collect\r\nthe productions of Nature, the richer our collections become, the more\r\ndo we see almost all the gaps filled up and the lines of separation\r\neffaced. We find ourselves reduced to an arbitrary determination, which\r\nsometimes leads us to seize upon the slightest differences of varieties,\r\nand form from them the distinctive character of what we call a species,\r\nand at other times leads us to consider as a variety of a certain\r\nspecies individuals a little bit different, which others regard as\r\nforming a separate species.\"[340]\r\n\r\nFor Lamarck, as for Darwin later, the chief problem was not the\r\nevolution and differentiation of types of structure, but the mode of\r\norigin of species.\r\n\r\nLamarck is at great pains to show how arbitrary are our determinations\r\nof species, and how artificial the classificatory groups which we\r\ndistinguish in Nature. Strictly speaking, there are in Nature only\r\nindividuals, \"... this is certain, that among her products Nature has in\r\nreality formed neither classes, nor orders, nor families, nor genera,\r\nnor constant species, but only individuals which succeed one another and\r\nresemble those that produced them. Now, these individuals belong to\r\ninfinitely diversified races, which shade into one another under all the\r\nforms and in all the degrees of organisation, and each of which\r\nmaintains itself without change, so long as no cause of change acts upon\r\nit\" (p. 41).\r\n\r\nBut there is a natural order in the animal kingdom, a progression from\r\nthe simpler to the more complex organisations, a natural _Echelle des\r\netres_.\r\n\r\nThis order is shown by the relation to one another of the large\r\nclassificatory groups, for they can be arranged in series from the\r\nsimplest to the most complex, somewhat as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. Infusoria.\r\n2. Polyps.\r\n3. Radiates.\r\n4. Worms.\r\n5. Insects.\r\n6. Arachnids.\r\n7. Crustacea.\r\n8. Annelids.\r\n9. Cirripedes.\r\n10. Molluscs.\r\n11. Fishes.\r\n12. Reptiles.\r\n13. Birds.\r\n14. Mammals.\r\n\r\nBut the order of Nature is essentially continuous, and the limits of\r\neven the best defined of these classes are in reality artificial--\"if\r\nthe order of Nature were perfectly known in a kingdom, the classes which\r\nwe should be forced to establish in it would always constitute entirely\r\nartificial sections\" (p. 45).\r\n\r\nIn the same way the lesser classificatory groups represent smaller\r\nsections of the one unique order of Nature. Note that Lamarck's\r\n_Echelle_ is in no way a morphological one, and was not intended to be\r\nsuch. It is a scale of increasing physiological differentiation, and the\r\nstages of it are marked by the acquirement of this or that new organ\r\n(_cf._ Oken). \"Observation of their state convinces one that in order to\r\nproduce them successively Nature has proceeded gradually from the\r\nsimpler to the more complex. Now Nature, having had in mind the\r\nrealisation of a plan of organisation which would permit of the greatest\r\nperfecting (that of the Vertebrates), a plan very different from those\r\nwhich she has been obliged to form as a preliminary to reaching it, one\r\nunderstands that, among the multitude of animals, one must necessarily\r\ncome across not a single system of organisation which has become\r\nprogressively perfected, but diverse very distinct systems, each of\r\nwhich has come into existence at the moment when each primary organ\r\nfirst put in its appearance\" (p. 171).\r\n\r\nFor Lamarck this order of Nature was not merely ideal--Nature had\r\nactually formed the classes successively, proceeding from the simpler to\r\nthe more complex; she had brought about this evolution by transforming\r\nthe primitive species of animals, raising them to higher degrees of\r\norganisation, and modifying them in relation to the environment in which\r\nthey found themselves.\r\n\r\nLamarck's theory of evolution is worked out in great detail in his\r\n_Philosophie zoologique_, but the exposition is diffuse and\r\ndisconnected; it is better in giving an account of it to follow the more\r\nconcise, mature and general exposition which he gives in the\r\nIntroduction to his _Histoire naturelle des Animaux sans Vertebres_.[341]\r\nNear the beginning of the Introduction Lamarck gives us in a few short\r\n\"Fundamental Principles\" the main lines of his general philosophy. He is\r\na confirmed materialist. Every fact and phenomenon is essentially\r\nphysical and owes its existence or production entirely to material\r\nbodies or to relations between them. All change and all movement is in\r\nthe last resort due to mechanical causes. Every fact or phenomenon\r\nobserved in a living body is at once a physical fact or phenomenon and a\r\nproduct of organisation (p. 19). Life, thought and sensation are not\r\nproperties of matter, but result from particular material combinations.\r\n\r\nHis thorough-going materialism is most clearly shown in its relation to\r\nliving things in the first three of the \"Zoological Principles and\r\nAxioms,\" which are developed further on in the book.\r\n\r\nThese are as follows:--\"1. No kind or particle of matter can have in\r\nitself the power of moving, living, feeling, thinking, nor of having\r\nideas; and if, outside of man, we observe bodies endowed with all or one\r\nof these faculties, we ought to consider these faculties as physical\r\nphenomena which Nature has been able to produce, not by employing some\r\nparticular kind of matter which itself possesses one or other of these\r\nfaculties, but by the order and state of things which she has\r\nconstituted in each organisation and in each particular system of\r\norgans.\r\n\r\n\"2. Every animal faculty, of whatever nature it may be, is an organic\r\nphenomenon, and results from a system of organs or an organ-apparatus\r\nwhich gives rise to it and upon which it is necessarily dependent.\r\n\r\n\"3. The more highly a faculty is developed the more complex is the\r\nsystem of organs which produces it, and the higher the general\r\norganisation; the more difficult also does it become to grasp its\r\nmechanism. But the faculty is none the less a phenomenon of\r\norganisation, and for that reason purely physical\" (p. 104).\r\n\r\nAccording to these \"axioms\" function is a direct and mechanical effect\r\nof structure.\r\n\r\nThe curious thing is that in spite of his avowed materialism, Lamarck's\r\nconception of life and evolution is profoundly psychological, and from\r\nthe conflict of his materialism and his vitalism (of which he was\r\nhimself hardly conscious), arise most of the obscurities and the\r\nirreductible self-contradiction of his theory.\r\n\r\nLamarck divided animals (psychologically!) into three great\r\ngroups--apathetic or insensitive animals, animals endowed with\r\nsensation, and intelligent animals. The first group, which comprise all\r\nthe lower Invertebrates, are distinguished from other animals by the\r\nfact that their actions are directly and mechanically due to the\r\nexcitations of the environment; they have no principle of reaction to\r\nexternal influences, but passively prolong into action the excitations\r\nthey receive from without. They are _irritable_ merely. The second group\r\nare distinguished from the first by their possessing, in addition to\r\nirritability, a power which Lamarck calls the _sentiment interieur_. He\r\nhas some difficulty in defining exactly what he means by it:--\"I have no\r\nterm to express this internal power possessed not only by intelligent\r\nanimals but also by those that are endowed merely with the faculty of\r\nsensation; it is a power which, when set in action by the feeling of a\r\nneed, causes the individual to act at once, _i.e._, in the very moment\r\nof the sensation it experiences; and if the individual is of those that\r\nare endowed with intelligence it nevertheless acts in such a case\r\nentirely without premeditation and before any mental operation has\r\nbrought its _will_ into play\" (p. 24).\r\n\r\nIt is the power we call instinct in animals (p. 25), and it implies\r\nneither consciousness nor will. It acts by transforming external into\r\ninternal excitations.\r\n\r\nTo this second group of animals, possessing the _sentiment interieur_,\r\nbelong the higher Invertebrates, notably insects and molluscs. Only\r\nanimals possessed of a more or less centralised nervous system can\r\nmanifest this _sentiment_, or principle of (unconscious) reaction to\r\nexternal stimuli.\r\n\r\nThe higher animals, or the four Vertebrate classes, form the group of\r\n\"intelligent animals.\" In virtue of their more complex organisation they\r\npossess in addition to the _sentiment interieur_ the faculties of\r\nintelligence and will.\r\n\r\nNow, broadly put, Lamarck's theory of evolution is that new organs are\r\nformed in direct reaction to needs (_besoins_) experienced by the\r\n_sentiment interieur_. The _sentiment interieur_ is therefore the cause\r\nnot only of instinctive action but also of all morphogenetic processes.\r\nWill and intelligence (which are confined to a relatively small number\r\nof animals) have little or nothing to do directly with evolution.\r\n\r\nTo understand the working-out of Lamarck's evolution-theory we must\r\nrevert to his conception of the _Echelle des etres_. What he wrote in\r\nthe _Philosophie zoologique_ is here repeated in the work of 1816 with\r\nlittle modification.\r\n\r\nThere is a real progression from the simpler to the more complex\r\norganisations; Nature has gradually complicated her creatures by giving\r\nthem new organs and therefore new faculties.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that Lamarck expressly refers to Bonnet (p.\r\n110), but refuses to accept his view of an _Echelle_ extending down into\r\nthe inorganic. Like Bonnet, however, and like the German\r\ntranscendentalists, Lamarck makes man the goal of evolution (p. 116). He\r\nmakes it quite clear that his _Echelle_ is a functional one, for he\r\nlinks Vertebrates to molluscs even while expressly admitting that they\r\nare not connected by any structural intermediates (p. 123). He does not\r\nfall into the error of the transcendentalists and assume that\r\nVertebrates and Invertebrates alike are formed upon one common plan of\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe progression of organisation shown by the animal kingdom has not been\r\naltogether regular and uninterrupted:--\"The progression in complexity of\r\norganisation shows here and there, in the general animal series,\r\nanomalies induced by the influence of environment and by the influence\r\nof the habits contracted\" (_Phil. zool._, i., p. 145).\r\n\r\nThere are thus really two causes at work to produce the variety of\r\norganisation as it appears to us, one which tends to produce a regular\r\nincrease in complexity, and one which disturbs and diversifies this\r\nregular advance.\r\n\r\nThe first cause Lamarck calls the vital power (_pouvoir de la vie_); the\r\nother may be called the influence of circumstance (_Anim. s. Vert._, p.\r\n134). To the latter cause are due the lacunae, the blind alleys, and the\r\ncomplications which the otherwise simple scale of perfection shows.\r\n\r\nTo explain both these aspects of evolution Lamarck propounded in his\r\nvolume of 1816 four laws, which read as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"_First Law_.--Life, by its own forces, tends continually to increase\r\nthe volume of every body possessing it, and to extend the dimensions of\r\nits parts, up to a limit which it brings about itself.\r\n\r\n\"_Second Law_.--The production of a new organ in an animal body results\r\nfrom the arisal and continuance of a new need, and from the new movement\r\nwhich this need brings into being and sustains.\r\n\r\n\"_Third Law_.--The degree of development of organs and their force of\r\naction are always proportionate to the use made of these organs.\r\n\r\n\"_Fourth Law_.--All that has been acquired, imprinted or changed in the\r\norganisation of the individual during the course of its life is\r\npreserved by generation and transmitted to the new individuals that\r\ndescend from the individual so modified\" (pp. 151-2).\r\n\r\nIt is mainly but not entirely by reason of the first of these laws that\r\norganisation tends to progress, and mainly by reason of the second and\r\nthird that difference of environment brings about diversity of\r\norganisation. In virtue of the fourth law the acquirements of the\r\nindividual become the property of the race.\r\n\r\nLamarck's exposition of his first law, that life tends by its own powers\r\nto enlarge and extend its bodily instrument, is vague and difficult to\r\nunderstand. He has already explained some pages back how the first\r\norganisms arose by spontaneous generation in the form of minute\r\ngelatinous utricles (_cf._ Oken). He conceives that it is in the\r\nmovements of the fluids proper to the organism that the power resides to\r\nenlarge and extend the body. Nutrition alone is not sufficient to bring\r\nabout extension; a special force is required, acting from within\r\noutwards (p. 153). In the most primitive organisms the movements of the\r\nvital fluids are weak and slow, but in the course of evolution they\r\ngradually accelerate, and, becoming more rapid, trace out canals in the\r\ndelicate tissue which contains them, and finally form organs.\r\n\r\nSubtle fluids play a great part in Lamarck's biology: they take the\r\nplace of the soul or entelechy which the vitalists would postulate to\r\nexplain organic happenings. Lamarck seems in this to follow certain of\r\nthe old materialists, who conceived the soul to be formed of a matter\r\nmore subtle than the ordinary.[342]\r\n\r\nIn his second law Lamarck's essentially vitalistic attitude comes out\r\nvery clearly, for it states that a psychological moment enters into all\r\nnew production of form, that the ultimate cause of the development of\r\nnew form is the need felt by the organism. This need is of course not a\r\nconscious one, it is a need perceived by the _sentiment interieur_.\r\n\r\nIn the large group of apathetic or insensitive animals, which do not\r\npossess this faculty, needs cannot be experienced; accordingly new\r\norgans are here formed directly and mechanically, by the movements of\r\nthe vital fluids set in action by excitations from without--the\r\nevolution, like the behaviour, of these animals is due to the direct and\r\nphysical action of the environment. \"But this is not the case with the\r\nmore highly organised animals which possess _feeling_. They experience\r\nneeds, and each need felt, acting upon their 'inner feeling,'\r\nimmediately directs the fluids and the forces to the part of the body\r\nwhere action can satisfy the need. Now, if there exists at this point an\r\norgan capable of performing the required action, it is quickly\r\nstimulated to act; and if the organ does not exist and the need is\r\npressing and sustained, bit by bit the organ is produced and developed\r\nin proportion to the continuity and the energy of its use\" (p. 155).\r\n\r\nIn intelligent animals the _sentiment interieur_ may be moved by thought\r\nor will.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the way in which the law works Lamarck takes the\r\nhypothetical case of a gastropod mollusc, which as it creeps along\r\nexperiences dimly the need to feel the objects in front of it. It makes\r\nan effort (unconscious, be it noted) to touch these objects with the\r\nanterior portions of its head, and sends forward continually to these\r\nparts a great volume of nervous and other fluids. From these efforts and\r\nthe repeated afflux of fluids there must result a development of the\r\nnerves supplying these parts. And as, along with the nervous fluids,\r\nnutritive juices constantly flow to the parts, there must result the\r\nformation of two or four tentacles in the places to which these fluids\r\nare directed. A curious mixture of mechanistic \"explanations\" and\r\nvitalistic hypothesis!\r\n\r\nIn his third law, that use and disuse are powerful to modify organs,\r\nLamarck is upon more solid ground, and can point to many instances of\r\nthe visible effect of these factors of change. It is of course rather\r\nclosely bound up with his second law and may even be regarded as an\r\nextension of it.\r\n\r\nThe law has reference to one of the most powerful means employed by\r\nNature to diversify species, a means which comes into play whenever the\r\nenvironment changes. The cause of the great diversity shown by animal\r\nspecies is indeed ultimately to be sought in the environment. As the\r\nimperfect and earliest forms developed they spread over the earth and\r\ninvaded the utmost corners of it:--\"One can imagine what an enormous\r\nvariety of habitats, stations, climates, available foods, environing\r\nmedia, etc., animals and plants have had to endure, as the existing\r\nspecies were forced to change their place of abode. And although these\r\nchanges have taken place with extreme slowness ... their reality,\r\nnecessitated by various causes, has none the less induced the species\r\naffected by them slowly to change their manner of life and their\r\nhabitual actions. Through the effects of the second and third of the\r\nlaws cited above, these induced activity-changes must have brought into\r\nbeing new organs, and must have been able to develop them further if\r\nmore frequent use was made of them; they must in the same way have been\r\ncapable of bringing about the degeneration and finally the complete\r\ndisappearance of existing organs which had become useless\" (p. 161).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the environment does not change, species remain\r\nconstant.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that change in environment is rather the occasion than\r\nthe cause of modification; the environment induces the organism to\r\nchange its habitual way of life; it sets up new needs, to satisfy which\r\nthe organism must modify its structure. It is the organism that takes\r\nthe active part in all this, the action of the environment is indirect.\r\n\r\nOf Lamarck's fourth law, which asserts the transmission of acquired\r\ncharacters, little need here be said in the way of exposition. Upon the\r\ntruth of it depends of course Lamarck's whole theory. He himself never\r\ndreamed that anyone would ever dispute it.\r\n\r\nLamarck sums up as follows:--\"By the four laws which I have just\r\nenunciated all the facts of organisation seem to me to be easily\r\nexplained; the progression in the complexity of organisation of animals,\r\nand in their faculties, seems to me easy to conceive; so, too, the means\r\nwhich Nature has employed to diversify animals, and bring them to the\r\nstate in which we now see them, become easily determinable\" (p. 168).\r\n\r\nIt is never made quite clear, we may note in passing, how far his second\r\nand third laws tend to bring about an increase in complexity, in\r\naddition to diversifying animals.[343]\r\n\r\n\"The function creates the organ,\" this would seem to be the kernel of\r\nLamarck's doctrine. But how does he reconcile this essentially\r\nvitalistic conception with his strictly materialistic philosophy?\r\n\r\nWe have seen that irritability, the _sentiment interieur_, and\r\nintelligence itself, are the effects of organisation. We are told\r\nfarther on that both the _sentiment_ and intelligence are caused by\r\nnervous fluids. A great part of both the _Philosophie zoologique_ and\r\nthe introduction to the _Animaux sans Vertebres_ is given up to the\r\nexposition of a materialistic psychology of animals and man, based\r\nentirely upon this hypothesis of nervous fluids. Thus habits are due to\r\nthe fluids hollowing out definite paths for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe _sentiment interieur_ acts by directing the movements of the subtle\r\nfluids of the body (which are themselves modifications of the nervous\r\nfluids) upon the parts where a new organ is needed. But if it is itself\r\nonly a result of the movement of nervous fluids? Again, how can a need\r\nbe \"felt\" by a nervous fluid? This is an entirely psychological notion\r\nand cannot be applied to a purely material system. Whence arises the\r\npower of the _sentiment interieur_ to canalise the energies of the\r\norganism, so to direct and co-ordinate them that they build up purposive\r\nstructures, or effect purposive actions (as in all instinctive\r\nbehaviour)? Either the _sentiment interieur_ is a psychological faculty,\r\nor it is nothing.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that, as expressed by Lamarck, the conception conceals\r\na radical confusion of thought. It is not possible to be a\r\nthorough-going materialist, and at the same time to believe that new\r\norgans are formed in direct response to needs felt by the organism.\r\nLamarck could never resolve this antinomy, and his speculations were\r\nthrown into confusion by it. To this cause is due the frequent obscurity\r\nof his writings.\r\n\r\nShould we be right in laying stress upon the psychological side of\r\nLamarck's theory, and disregarding the materialistic dress in which,\r\nperhaps under the influence of the materialism current in his youth, he\r\nclothed his essentially vitalistic thought? Everything goes to prove\r\nit--his constant preoccupation with psychological questions, his tacit\r\nassimilation of organ-formation to instinctive behaviour, his constant\r\ninsistence on the importance of _besoin_ and _habitude_.\r\n\r\nLet us not forget the profundity of his main idea, that, exception made\r\nfor the lower forms, the animal is essentially active, that it always\r\n_reacts_ to the external world, is never passively acted upon. Let us\r\nnot forget that he pointed out the essentially psychological moment\r\nimplied in all processes of individual adaptation. With keen insight he\r\nrealised that conscious intelligence counts for little in evolution, and\r\nfocussed attention upon the unconscious but obscurely psychical\r\nprocesses of instinct and morphogenesis.\r\n\r\nNot without reason have the later schools of evolutionary thought, who\r\ndeveloped the psychological and vitalistic side of his doctrine, called\r\nthemselves Neo-Lamarckians.\r\n\r\nWe shall say then that Lamarck, in spite of his materialism, was the\r\nfounder of the \"psychological\" theory of evolution.\r\n\r\nLamarck stood curiously aloof and apart from the scientific thought of\r\nhis day.[344] He took no interest in the morphological problems that\r\nfilled the minds of Cuvier and Geoffroy; he had indeed no feeling at all\r\nfor morphology. He did not realise, like Cuvier, the _convenance des\r\nparties_, the marvellous co-ordination of parts to form a whole; he had\r\nlittle conception of what is really implied in the word \"organism.\" He\r\nwas not, like Geoffroy, imbued with a lively sense of the unity of plan\r\nand composition, and of the significance of vestigial organs as\r\nwitnesses to that unity. He seems not to have known of the\r\nrecapitulation theory, of which he might have made such good use as\r\npowerful evidence for evolution. Even with the German\r\ntranscendentalists, with whom in the looseness of his generalisations he\r\nshows some affinity, he seems not to have been specially acquainted.\r\n\r\nHe was interested more in the problems suggested to him by his daily\r\nwork in the museum. He wanted to know why species graded so annoyingly\r\ninto one another; he wanted to examine critically his haunting suspicion\r\nthat species were really not distinct, and that classification was\r\npurely conventional. The question, too, of the adaptation of species to\r\ntheir environment, the problem of ecological adaptation, in distinction\r\nto that of functional adaptation which interested Cuvier so greatly,\r\ncame vividly before him as he worked through the vast collections of the\r\nmuseum. He was the first systematist to occupy himself in a\r\nphilosophical manner with the problems of general biology. He introduced\r\nnew problems and a new way of looking at old. With Lamarck the problem\r\nof species and the problem of ecological adaptation enter into general\r\nbiology.\r\n\r\nThe one point in which he does definitely carry on the thought of his\r\npredecessors is his conception of the animal kingdom as forming a scale\r\nof (functional) perfection. He did not go to the same extreme as Bonnet;\r\nhe did not even consider that the animal series was a continuation of\r\nthe vegetable series; in his opinion they formed two diverging scales.\r\nHe recognised, too, that among animals there was no simple and regular\r\ngradation from the lowest to the highest, but that the orderly\r\nprogression was disturbed and diverted by the necessity of adaptation to\r\ndifferent environments. It is interesting to note that in developing\r\nthis idea he arrived at a roughly accurate distinction between\r\nhomologous and analogous structures. More importance, he thought, was to\r\nbe attributed in classifying animals to characters which appeared due to\r\nthe \"plan of Nature\" than to such as were produced by an external\r\nmodifying cause (p. 299). But he did not formulate the distinction in\r\nany strictly morphological way.\r\n\r\nAs his ideas developed he laid less stress upon the simplicity and\r\ncontinuity of the scale; in his supplementary remarks to the\r\nIntroduction of 1816 he admits that the series is really very much\r\nbranched, and even that there may be two distinct series among animals\r\ninstead of one. His last schema of the course of evolution shows no\r\nlittle analogy with the genealogical trees of Darwinian speculation. It\r\nis headed \"The presumed _Order_ of the formation of Animals, showing two\r\nseparate partly-branching series,\" and it reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n   I.--_Series of Non-articulated_    II.--_Series of Articulated_\r\n                 _Animals_.                      _Animals_.\r\n\"\r\nI    |--         Infusoria.\r\nn    |               |\r\ns A  |             Polyps.\r\ne n  |               |\r\nn i  |        ----------------\r\ns m  |        |              |\r\ni a  |     Ascidians.

There is evidence, however, that\r\nboth Meckel and Geoffroy owed a good many of their evolutionary ideas to\r\nLamarck, and Cuvier paid him at least the compliment of criticising his\r\ntheory,[345] not distinguishing it, however, very clearly from the\r\nevolutionary theories of the transcendentalists. But, speaking\r\ngenerally, Lamarck's theory of evolution exercised very little influence\r\nupon his contemporaries. This was probably due partly to the obscurity\r\nand confusion of his thought, partly to his lack of sympathy with the\r\nbiological thought of his day, which was preponderatingly morphological.\r\n\r\nIt was not that men's minds were not ripe for evolution, for in the\r\nearly decades of the 19th century evolution was in the air. There were\r\nfew of von Baer's contemporaries who had not read Lamarck;[346] Erasmus\r\nDarwin's _Zoonomia_ ran through three editions, and was translated into\r\nGerman, French and Italian;[247] German philosophy was full of the idea of\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nThere was no unreadiness to accept the derivation of present-day species\r\nfrom a primordial form--if only some solid evidence for such derivation\r\nwere forthcoming. Cuvier and von Baer, as we have seen, combated the\r\ncurrent evolution theories on the ground that the evidence was\r\ninsufficient, but von Baer at least had no rooted objection to\r\nevolution. In an essay of 1834, entitled _The Most General Law of Nature\r\nin all Development_,[348] von Baer expressed belief in a limited amount of\r\nevolution. In this paper he did not admit that all animals have\r\ndeveloped from one parent form, and he refused to believe that man has\r\ndescended from an ape; but, basing his supposition upon the facts of\r\nvariability and upon the evidence of palaeontology, he went so far as to\r\nmaintain that many species have evolved from parent stocks. In the\r\nabsence of conclusive proofs he did not commit himself to a belief in\r\nany extended or comprehensive process of evolution.\r\n\r\nImbued as he was with the idea of development von Baer saw in evolution\r\na process essentially of the same nature as the development of the\r\nindividual. Evolution, like development, was due to a _Bildungskraft_ or\r\nformative force. The ultimate law of all becoming was that \"the history\r\nof Nature is nothing but the history of the ever-advancing victory of\r\nspirit over matter\" (p. 71). In a later essay (1835) in the same volume\r\nhe says that all natural science is nothing but a long commentary on the\r\nsingle phrase _Es werde!_. (p. 86).\r\n\r\nAs we shall see, von Baer adopted in later years the same attitude to\r\nDarwinism as he did to the evolution theories in vogue in his youth.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the twenty or thirty years before the publication of the\r\n_Origin of Species_ (1859) no evolution theory of any importance was\r\npublished, and although the great majority of biologists believed in the\r\nconstancy of species, there were not wanting some who, like von Baer,\r\nhad an open mind on the subject, or even believed in the occurrence of\r\nevolutionary processes of small scope. Isidore Geoffroy St Hilaire, the\r\nson of the great Etienne Geoffroy St Hilaire, seems to have held that\r\nspecies might be formed from varieties. The law which L. Agassiz thought\r\nhe could establish,[349] of the parallelism between palaeontological\r\nsuccession, systematic rank, and embryological development, tended to\r\nhelp the progress of evolutionary ideas. J. V. Carus, who afterwards\r\nbecame a supporter of Darwin, seems already, in 1853, to have inferred\r\nfrom Agassiz's law the probability of evolution.[350]\r\n\r\nBut no evolution theory was taken very seriously before 1859, when the\r\n_Origin of Species_ was published.\r\n\r\nLike Lamarck, Charles Darwin was, neither by inclination nor by\r\ntraining, a morphologist. In his youth he was a collector, a sportsman\r\nand a field geologist. His voyage round the world on the _Beagle_\r\naroused in him keen interest in the problem of species--their variety,\r\ntheir variation according to place and time, their adaptedness to\r\nenvironment. The conviction gradually took possession of his mind that\r\nthe puzzling facts of geographical range and geological succession which\r\nhe observed wherever he went were explicable only on the hypothesis that\r\nspecies change. He was not satisfied with the theories of evolution that\r\nhad been proposed by his grandfather, by Lamarck, and by E. Geoffroy St\r\nHilaire--he did not indeed understand these theories any too well. He\r\nresolved to work out the problem in his own way, for his own\r\nsatisfaction. He tells us all this very clearly in his autobiography.\r\n\"During the voyage of the _Beagle_ I had been deeply impressed by\r\ndiscovering in the Pampean formation great fossil animals covered with\r\narmour like that on the existing armadillos; secondly, by the manner in\r\nwhich closely allied animals replace one another in proceeding\r\nsouthwards over the continent; and thirdly, by the South American\r\ncharacter of most of the productions of the Galapagos archipelago, and\r\nmore especially by the manner in which they differ slightly on each\r\nisland of the group; some of the islands appearing to be very ancient in\r\na geological sense.\r\n\r\n\"It was evident that such facts as these, as well as many others, could\r\nonly be explained on the supposition that species gradually become\r\nmodified; and the subject haunted me. But it was equally evident that\r\nneither the action of the surrounding conditions, nor the will of the\r\norganisms (especially in the case of plants) could account for the\r\ninnumerable cases in which organisms of every kind are beautifully\r\nadapted to their habits of life--for instance, a woodpecker or a\r\ntree-frog to climb trees, or a seed for dispersal by hooks or plumes. I\r\nhad always been much struck by such adaptations, and until these could\r\nbe explained it seemed to me almost useless to endeavour to prove by\r\nindirect evidence that species have been modified.\"[351]\r\n\r\nAll Darwin's varied subsequent work revolved round these, for him,\r\nessential problems--How do species change, and how do they become\r\nadapted to their environment? He never ceased to be essentially a field\r\nnaturalist, and his theory of natural selection would have been an empty\r\nand abstract thing if his vast knowledge and understanding of the \"web\r\nof life\" had not given it colour and form. He never lost touch with the\r\nliving thing in its living, breathing reality--even plants he rightly\r\nregarded as active things, full of tricks and contrivances for making\r\ntheir way in the world. No one ever realised more vividly than he the\r\ndelicacy and complexity of the adaptations to environment which are the\r\nnecessary condition of success in the struggle for existence. Almost his\r\ngreatest service to biology was that he made biologists realise as they\r\nnever did before the vast importance of environment. He took biology\r\ninto the open air, away from the museum and the dissecting-room.\r\n\r\nNaturally this attitude was not without its drawbacks. It led him to\r\ntake only a lukewarm interest in the problems of morphology. It is true\r\nhe used the facts of morphology with great effect as powerful arguments\r\nfor evolution, but it was not from such facts that he deduced his theory\r\nto account for evolution. It is questionable indeed whether the theory\r\nof natural selection is properly applicable to the problems of form. It\r\nwas invented to account for the evolution of specific differences and of\r\necological adaptations; it was not primarily intended as an explanation\r\nof the more wonderful and more mysterious facts of the _convenance des\r\nparties_ and the interaction of structure and function. Perhaps Darwin\r\ndid not realise this inner aspect of adaptation quite so vividly as he\r\ndid the more superficial adaptation of organisms to their environment.\r\nIt was, perhaps, his lack of morphological training and experience that\r\nled him to disregard the problems of form, or at least to realise very\r\ninsufficiently their difficulty.\r\n\r\nIt is in any case very significant that only a small part of his _Origin\r\nof Species_ is devoted to the discussion of morphological\r\nquestions--only one chapter out of the fourteen contained in the first\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nThough the theory of natural selection took little account of the\r\nproblems of form, Darwin's masterly vindication of the theory of\r\nevolution was of immense service to morphology, and Darwin himself was\r\nthe first to point out what a great light evolution threw upon all\r\nmorphological problems. In a few pages of the _Origin_ he laid the\r\nfoundations of evolutionary morphology.\r\n\r\nWe have here to consider his interpretation of morphological facts and\r\nits relation to the current morphology of his time.\r\n\r\nThe sketch of his theory, written in 1842,[352] shows a very significant\r\ndivision into two parts--the first dealing with the positive facts of\r\nvariability and the theory of natural selection, the second with the\r\ngeneral evidence for evolution. It is in the second part that the\r\nparagraphs on morphological matters occur. In paragraph 7, on affinities\r\nand classification, Darwin points out that on the theory of evolution\r\nhomological relationship would be real relationship, and the natural\r\nsystem would really be genealogical. In the next paragraph he notes that\r\nevolution would account for the unity of type in the great classes, for\r\nthe metamorphosis of organs, and for the close resemblance which early\r\nembryos show to one another. It is of special interest to note that he\r\ndefinitely rejects the Meckel-Serres theory of recapitulation. \"It is\r\nnot true,\" he writes, \"that one passes through the form of a lower\r\ngroup, though no doubt fish more nearly related to foetal state\" (p.\r\n42). The greater divergence which adults show seems to him to be due to\r\nthe fact that selection acts more on the later than on the embryonic\r\nstages. He realises very clearly how illuminative the theory of\r\nevolution is when applied to the puzzling facts of embryonic\r\ndevelopment. \"The less differences of foetus--this has obvious meaning\r\non this view: otherwise how strange that a horse, a man, a bat should at\r\none time of life have arteries, running in a manner which is only\r\nintelligibly useful in a fish! The natural system being on theory\r\ngenealogical, we can at once see why foetus, retaining traces of the\r\nancestral form, is of the highest value in classification\" (p. 45).\r\n\r\nAbortive organs, too, gain significance on the evolutionary hypothesis.\r\n\"The affinity of different groups, the unity of types of structure, the\r\nrepresentative forms through which foetus passes, the metamorphosis of\r\norgans, the abortion of others, cease to be metaphorical expressions and\r\nbecome intelligible facts\" (p. 50).\r\n\r\nIn general, organisms can be understood only if we take into account the\r\ncardinal fact that they are historical beings. \"We must look at every\r\ncomplicated mechanism and instinct as the summary of a long history of\r\nuseful contrivances much like a work of art\" (p. 51).[353]\r\n\r\nAlready in 1842 Darwin had seized upon the main principles of\r\nevolutionary morphology: the indications then given are elaborated in\r\nthe thirteenth chapter of the _Origin of Species_ (1st ed., 1859). A\r\ngood part of this chapter is given up to a discussion of the principles\r\nof classification, only a few pages dealing with morphology proper. But,\r\nas Darwin rightly saw, the two things are inseparable.\r\n\r\nWe note first that there is no hint of the \"scale of beings\"--Darwin\r\nconceives the genealogical tree as many branched. Animals can be classed\r\nin \"groups under groups,\" and cannot be arranged in one single series.\r\n\r\nHe discusses first what kind of characters have the greatest\r\nclassificatory value. Certain empirical rules have been recognised, more\r\nor less consciously, by systematists--that analogical characters are\r\nless valuable than homological, that characters of great physiological\r\nimportance are not always valuable for classificatory purposes, that\r\nrudimentary organs are often very useful, and so on. He finds that as a\r\ngeneral rule \"the less any part of the organisation is concerned with\r\nspecial habits, the more important it becomes for classification\" (p.\r\n414), and adduces in support Owen's remark that the generative organs\r\nafford very clear indications of affinities, since they are unlikely to\r\nbe modified by special habits. These rules of classification can be\r\nexplained \"on the view that the natural system is founded on descent\r\nwith modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as\r\nshowing true affinity ... are those which have been inherited from a\r\ncommon parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical;\r\nthat community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been\r\nunconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the\r\nenunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together and\r\nseparating objects more or less alike\" (p. 420).\r\n\r\nIn general, then, homological characters are more valuable for\r\nclassificatory purposes because they have a longer pedigree than\r\nanalogical characters, which represent recent acquirements of the race.\r\n\r\nComing to morphology proper, Darwin takes up the question of the unity\r\nof type, and the homology of parts, for which the unity of type is but a\r\ngeneral expression.\r\n\r\nHe treats this on the same lines as E. Geoffroy St Hilaire, and Owen,\r\nreferring indeed specifically to Geoffroy's law of connections. \"What\r\ncan be more curious,\" he asks, \"than that the hand of a man, formed for\r\ngrasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of a horse, the paddle of\r\nthe porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the\r\nsame pattern, and should include similar bones, in the same relative\r\npositions? Geoffroy St Hilaire has strongly insisted on the high\r\nimportance of relative position or connection in homologous parts; they\r\nmay differ to almost any extent in form and size, and yet remain\r\nconnected together in the same invariable order\" (p. 434).\r\n\r\nThe unity of plan cannot be explained on teleological grounds, as Owen\r\nhas admitted in his _Nature of Limbs_, nor is it explicable on the\r\nhypothesis of special creation (p. 435). It can be understood only on\r\nthe theory that animals are descended from one another and retain for\r\ninnumerable generations the essential organisation of their ancestors.\r\n\"The explanation is to a large extent simple on the theory of the\r\nselection of successive slight modifications--each modification being\r\nprofitable in some way to the modified form, but often affecting by\r\ncorrelation other parts of the organisation. In changes of this nature,\r\nthere will be little or no tendency to alter the original pattern or to\r\ntranspose the parts.... If we suppose that the ancient progenitor, the\r\narchetype as it may be called, of all animals, had its limbs constructed\r\non the existing general pattern, for whatever purpose they served, we\r\ncan at once perceive the plain significance of the homologous\r\nconstruction of the limbs throughout the whole class\" (p. 435).\r\n\r\nWe may note three important points in this passage--first, the\r\nidentification of the archetype with the common progenitor; second, the\r\nview that progressive evolution is essentially adaptive, and dominated\r\nby natural selection; and third, the _petitio principii_ involved in the\r\nassumption that adaptive modification brings inevitably in its train the\r\nnecessary correlative changes.\r\n\r\nIn his section on morphology Darwin shows clearly the influence of Owen,\r\nand through him of the transcendental anatomists. He refers to the\r\ntranscendental idea of \"metamorphosis,\" as exemplified in the vertebral\r\ntheory of the skull and the theory of the plant appendage, and shows\r\nhow, on the hypothesis of descent with modification, \"metamorphosis\" may\r\nnow be interpreted literally, and no longer figuratively merely (p.\r\n439).\r\n\r\nVery great interest attaches to Darwin's treatment of development, for\r\npost-Darwinian morphology was based to a very large extent on the\r\npresumed relation between the development of the individual and the\r\nevolution of the race. Just as he kept clear of the notion of the scale\r\nof beings, so he avoided the snare of the Meckel-Serres theory of\r\nrecapitulation, according to which the embryo of the highest animal,\r\nman, during its development climbs the ladder upon the rungs of which\r\nthe whole animal series is distributed, in its gradual progression from\r\nsimplicity to complexity. The law of development which he adopts is that\r\nof von Baer, which states that development is essentially\r\ndifferentiation, and that as a result embryos belonging to the same\r\ngroup resemble one another the more the less advanced they are in\r\ndevelopment. There can be little doubt that he was indebted to von Baer\r\nfor the idea, and in the later editions of the _Origin_ he acknowledges\r\nthis by quoting the well-known passage in which von Baer tells how he\r\nhad two embryos in spirit which he was unable to refer definitely to\r\ntheir proper class among Vertebrates.[354]\r\n\r\nNot only are embryos more alike than adults, because less\r\ndifferentiated, but it is in points not directly connected with the\r\nconditions of existence, not strictly adaptive, that their resemblance\r\nis strongest (p. 440)--think, for instance, of the arrangement of aortic\r\narches common to all vertebrate embryos. Larval forms are to some extent\r\nexceptions to this rule, for they are often specially adapted to their\r\nparticular mode of life, and convergence of structure may accordingly\r\nresult. All these facts require an explanation. \"How, then, can we\r\nexplain these several facts in embryology--namely, the very general, but\r\nnot universal, difference in structure between the embryo and the\r\nadult--of parts in the same individual embryo, which ultimately become\r\nvery unlike and serve for different purposes, being at this early period\r\nof growth alike--of embryos of different species within the same class,\r\ngenerally but not universally, resembling each other--of the structure\r\nof the embryo not being closely related to its conditions of existence,\r\nexcept when the embryo becomes at any period of life active and has to\r\nprovide for itself--of the embryo apparently having sometimes a higher\r\norganisation than the mature animal, into which it is developed\" (pp.\r\n442-3). Obviously all these facts are formally explained by the doctrine\r\nof descent. But Darwin goes further, he tries to show exactly how it is\r\nthat the embryos resemble one another more than the adults. He thinks\r\nthat the phenomenon results from two principles--first, that\r\nmodifications usually supervene late in the life of the individual; and\r\nsecond, that such modifications tend to be inherited by the offspring at\r\na corresponding, not early, age (p. 444).\r\n\r\nThus, applying these principles to a hypothetical case of the origin of\r\nnew species of birds from a common stock, he writes:--\"... from the many\r\nslight successive steps of variation having supervened at a rather late\r\nage and having been inherited at a corresponding age, the young of the\r\nnew species of our supposed genus will manifestly tend to resemble each\r\nother much more closely than do the adults, just as we have seen in the\r\ncase of pigeons\"[355] (pp. 446-7).\r\n\r\nSince the embryo shows the generalised type, the structure of the embryo\r\nis useful for classificatory purposes. \"For the embryo is the animal in\r\nits less modified state; and in so far it reveals the structure of its\r\nprogenitor\" (p. 449)--the embryological archetype reveals the ancestral\r\nform. \"Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we thus look at the\r\nembryo as a picture, more or less complete, of the parent form of each\r\ngreat class of animals\" (p. 450)--a prophetic remark, in view of the\r\nenormous subsequent development of phylogenetic speculation.\r\n\r\nWe may sum up by saying that Darwin interpreted von Baer's law\r\nphylogenetically.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the chapter is devoted to a discussion of abortive and\r\nvestigial organs, whose existence Darwin naturally turns to great\r\nadvantage in his argument for evolution. Throughout the whole chapter\r\nDarwin's preoccupation with the problems of classification is clearly\r\nmanifest.\r\n\r\nOn the question as to whether descent was monophyletic or polyphyletic\r\nDarwin expressed no dogmatic opinion. \"I believe that animals have\r\ndescended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an\r\nequal or lesser number.... I should infer from analogy that probably all\r\nthe organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended\r\nfrom one primordial form, into which life was first breathed\" (p. 484).\r\n\r\nDarwin rightly laid much stress upon the morphological evidence for\r\nevolution,[356] which he considered to be weighty. It probably contributed\r\ngreatly to the success of his theory. Though he himself did little or no\r\nwork in pure morphology, he was alive to the importance of such work,[357]\r\nand followed with interest the progress of evolutionary morphology,\r\nincorporating some of its results in later editions of the _Origin_, and\r\nin his _Descent of Man_ (1871).\r\n\r\nIn his morphology Darwin was hardly up to date. He does not seem to have\r\nknown at first hand the splendid work of the German morphologists, such\r\nas Rathke and Reichert; he pays no attention to the cell-theory, nor to\r\nthe germ-layer theory. His sources are, in the main, Geoffroy St\r\nHilaire, Owen, von Baer, Agassiz, Milne-Edwards, and Huxley.\r\n\r\nPerhaps his greatest omission was that he did not give any adequate\r\ntreatment of the problem of functional adaptation and the correlation of\r\nparts. It is not too much to say that Darwin not only disregarded these\r\nproblems almost entirely, but by his insistence upon ecological\r\nadaptation and upon certain superficial aspects of correlation,\r\nsucceeded in giving to the words \"adaptation\" and \"correlation\" a new\r\nsignification, whereby they lost to a large extent their true and\r\noriginal functional meaning.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Darwin himself, as well as his successors, believed that\r\nnatural selection was all-powerful to account for the evolution of the\r\nmost complicated organs, but it may be questioned whether he realised\r\nall the conditions of the problem of which he thus easily disposed. He\r\nsays, rightly, in an important passage, that \"It is generally\r\nacknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on two great\r\nlaws--Unity of Type, and the Conditions of Existence. By unity of type\r\nis meant that fundamental agreement in structure which we see in organic\r\nbeings of the same class, and which is quite independent of their habits\r\nof life. On my theory, unity of type is explained by unity of descent.\r\nThe expression of conditions of existence, so often insisted upon by the\r\nillustrious Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of natural\r\nselection. For natural selection acts by either now adapting _the\r\nvarying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of\r\nlife_:[358] or by having adapted them during past periods of time: the\r\nadaptations being aided in many cases by the increased use or disuse of\r\nparts, being affected by the direct action of the external conditions of\r\nlife, and subjected in all cases to the several laws of growth and\r\nvariation. Hence, in fact, the law of the Conditions of Existence is the\r\nhigher law; as it includes, through the inheritance of former variations\r\nand adaptations, that of Unity of Type\" (_Origin_, 6th ed., Pop.\r\nImpression, pp. 260-1). It is clear that Darwin took the phrase\r\n\"Conditions of Existence\" to mean the environmental conditions, and the\r\nlaw of the Conditions of Existence to mean the law of adaptation to\r\nenvironment. But that is not what Cuvier meant by the phrase: he\r\nunderstood by it the principle of the co-ordination of the parts to form\r\nthe whole, the essential condition for the existence of any organism\r\nwhatsoever (see above, Chap. III., p. 34).\r\n\r\nOf this thought there is in Darwin little trace, and that is why he did\r\nnot sufficiently appreciate the weight of the argument brought against\r\nhis theory that it did not account for the correlation of variations.\r\n\r\nDarwin's conception of correlation was singularly incomplete. As\r\nexamples of correlation he advanced such trivial cases as the relation\r\nbetween albinism, deafness and blue eyes in cats, or between the\r\ntortoise-shell colour and the female sex. He used the word only in\r\nconnection with what he called \"correlated variation,\" meaning by this\r\nexpression \"that the whole organisation is so tied together during its\r\ngrowth and development, that when slight variations in any one part\r\noccur, and are accumulated through natural selection, other parts become\r\nmodified\" (6th ed., p. 177). He took it for granted that the \"correlated\r\nvariations\" would be adapted to the original variation which was acted\r\nupon by natural selection, and he saw no difficulty in the gradual\r\nevolution of a complicated organ like the eye if only the steps were\r\nsmall enough. \"It has been objected,\" he writes, \"that in order to\r\nmodify the eye and still preserve it as a perfect instrument, many\r\nchanges would have to be effected simultaneously, which, it is assumed,\r\ncould not be done through natural selection; but as I have attempted to\r\nshow in my work on the variation of domestic animals, it is not\r\nnecessary to suppose that the modifications were all simultaneous, if\r\nthey were extremely slight and gradual\" (6th ed., p. 226).\r\n\r\nIn post-Darwinian speculation the difficulty of explaining correlated\r\nvariation by natural selection alone became more acutely realised, and\r\nit was chiefly this difficulty that led Weismann to formulate his\r\nhypothesis of germinal selection as a necessary supplement to the\r\ngeneral selection theory.\r\n\r\nThe change in the conception of correlation which Darwin's influence\r\nbrought about has been very clearly stated by E. von Hartmann,[359] from\r\nwhom the following is taken:--\"While the correlation of parts in the\r\norganism was before Darwin regarded exclusively from the standpoint of\r\nmorphological systematics, Darwin tried to look at it from the\r\nstandpoint of physiological and genealogical development, and in so\r\ndoing he put the standpoint of morphological systematics in the shade.\r\nBut the more we are now beginning to realise that systematic\r\nrelationship does not necessarily imply genetic affinity the more must\r\nthe correlation of parts come back into favour as a systematic\r\nprinciple. While Darwin only, as it were, against his will, relied on\r\nthe law of correlation as a last resort when all other help failed, this\r\nlaw must be regarded, from the standpoint of the orderly inner\r\ndetermination of all organic form-change, as having the rank of the\r\nhighest principle of all, a principle which rules parallel, divergent\r\nand convergent evolution\" (pp. 47-8).\r\n\r\nFurther on, following Radl, he characterises Darwin's attitude to the\r\nlaw of correlation in these terms:--\"Darwin's interest is entirely\r\nfocussed on the variation, the function, the causes of form-production,\r\nin short, upon evolution. Accordingly he regards correlation essentially\r\nas correlative variation in the sense of a _departure_ from the given\r\ntype. With morphological correlation in _different_ types Darwin\r\ntroubles himself not at all, nor with correlation in the normal\r\ndevelopment of a type\" (p. 49).\r\n\r\nCuvier's conception of the _convenance des parties_, essential to all\r\nbiology, remained on the whole foreign to Darwin's thought, and to the\r\nthought of his successors.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed one of their boasts that they had finally eliminated all\r\nteleology from Nature. The great and immediate success which Darwinism\r\nhad among the younger generation of biologists and among scientific men\r\nin general was due in large part to the fact that it fitted in well with\r\nthe prevailing materialism of the day, and gave solid ground for the\r\nhope that in time a complete mechanistic explanation of life would be\r\nforthcoming. \"Darwinismus\" became the battle-cry of the militant spirits\r\nof that time.\r\n\r\nIt was precisely this element in Darwinism that was repugnant to most of\r\nDarwin's opponents, in whose ranks were found the majority of the\r\nmorphologists of the old school. They found it impossible to believe\r\nthat evolution could have come about by fortuitous variation and\r\nfortuitous selection; they objected to Darwin that he had enunciated no\r\nreal _Entwickelungsgesetz_, or law governing evolution. They were not\r\nunwilling to believe that evolution was a real process, though many drew\r\nthe line at the derivation of man from apes, but they felt that if\r\nevolution had really taken place, it must have been under the guidance\r\nof some principle of development, that there must have been manifested\r\nin evolution some definite and orderly tendency towards perfection.[360]\r\n\r\nNo one expressed this objection with greater force than did von Baer, in\r\na series of masterly essays[361] which the Darwinians, through sheer\r\ninability to grasp his point of view, dismissed as the maunderings of\r\nold age. In these essays von Baer pointed out the necessity for the\r\nteleological point of view, at least as complementary to the\r\nmechanistic. His general position is that of the \"statical\"\r\nteleology--to use Driesch's term--of Kant and Cuvier. His attitude to\r\nDarwinism is determined by his teleology. He admits, just as in 1834, a\r\nlimited amount of evolution; he criticises the evolution theory of\r\nDarwin on the same lines exactly as forty or fifty years previously he\r\nhad criticised the recapitulation and evolution-theories of the\r\ntranscendentalists--principally on the ground that their deductions far\r\noutrun the positive facts at their disposal. He rejects the theory of\r\nnatural selection entirely, on the ground that evolution, like\r\ndevelopment, must have an end or purpose (_Ziel_)--\"A becoming without a\r\npurpose is in general unthinkable\" (p. 231); he points out, too, the\r\ndifficulty of explaining the correlation of parts upon the Darwinian\r\nhypothesis. His own conception of the evolutionary process is that it is\r\nessentially _zielstrebig_ or guided by final causes, that it is a true\r\n_evolutio_ or differentiation, just as individual development is an\r\norderly progress from the general to the special. He believed in\r\nsaltatory evolution, in polyphyletic descent, and in the greater\r\nplasticity of the organism in earlier times.\r\n\r\nThe idea of saltatory evolution he took from Koelliker, who shortly after\r\nthe publication of the _Origin_ promulgated in a critical note on\r\nDarwinism a sketch of his theory of \"heterogeneous generation.\"[362]\r\n\r\nKoelliker's attitude is typical of that taken up by many of the\r\nmorphologists of the day.[363] He accepts evolution completely, but\r\nrejects Darwinism because it recognises no _Entwickelungsgesetz_, or\r\nprinciple of evolution. For the Darwinian theory of evolution through\r\nthe selection of small fortuitous variations he would substitute the\r\ntheory of evolution through sudden, large variations, brought about by\r\nthe influence of a general law of evolution. This is his theory of\r\nheterogeneous generation. \"The fundamental idea of this hypothesis is\r\nthat under the influence of a general law of evolution creatures produce\r\nfrom their germs others which differ from them\" (p. 181). It is to be\r\nnoticed that Koelliker laid more stress upon the _Entwickelungsgesetz_\r\nthan upon the saltatory nature of variation, for he says a few pages\r\nfurther on--\"the notion at the base of my theory is that a great\r\nevolutionary plan underlies the development of the whole organised\r\nworld, and urges on the simpler forms towards ever higher stages of\r\ncomplexity\" (p. 184). Saltatory evolution was not the essential point of\r\nthe theory:--\"Another difference between the Darwinian hypothesis and\r\nmine is that I postulate many saltatory changes, but I will not and\r\nindeed cannot lay the chief stress upon this point, for I have not\r\nintended to maintain that the general law of evolution which I hold to\r\nbe the cause of the creation of organisms, and which alone manifests\r\nitself in the activity of generation, cannot also so act that from one\r\nform others quite gradually arise\" (p. 185). He put forward the\r\nhypothesis of saltatory variation because it seemed to him to lighten\r\nmany of the difficulties of Darwinism--the lack of transition forms, the\r\nenormous time required for evolution, and so on. It should be noted that\r\nKoelliker regarded his principle of evolution as mechanical.\r\n\r\nIt would take too long to show in detail how a belief in innate laws of\r\nevolution was held by the majority of Darwin's critics. A few further\r\nexamples must suffice.\r\n\r\nRichard Owen, who in 1868[364] admitted the possibility of evolution, held\r\nthat \"a purposive route of development and change, of correlation and\r\ninterdependence, manifesting intelligent Will, is as determinable in the\r\nsuccession of races as in the development and organisation of the\r\nindividual. Generations do not vary accidentally, in any and every\r\ndirection; but in pre-ordained, definite, and correlated courses\" (p.\r\n808).\r\n\r\nHe conceived change to have taken place by abrupt variation, independent\r\nof environment and habit, by \"departures from parental type, probably\r\nsudden and seemingly monstrous, but adapting the progeny inheriting such\r\nmodifications to higher purposes\" (p. 797). He believed spontaneous\r\ngeneration to be a phenomenon constantly taking place, and constantly\r\ngiving the possibility of new lines of evolution.\r\n\r\nE. von Hartmann in his _Philosophie des Unbewussten_ (1868) and in his\r\nvaluable essay on _Wahrheit und Irrtum im Darwinismus_ (1874) criticised\r\nDarwinism in a most suggestive manner from the vitalistic standpoint. He\r\ndrew attention to the importance of active adaptation, the necessity for\r\nassuming definite and correlated variability, and to the evidence for\r\nthe existence of an immanent, purposive, but unconscious principle of\r\nevolution, active as well in phylogenetic as in individual development.\r\n\r\nIn France H. Milne-Edwards[365] stated the problem thus:--\"In the present\r\nstate of science, ought we to attribute to modifications dependent on\r\nthe action of known external agents the differences in the organic types\r\nmanifested by the animals distributed over the surface of the globe\r\neither at the present day, or in past geological ages? Or must the\r\norigin of types transmissible by heredity be attributed to causes of\r\nanother order, to forces whose effects are not apparent in the present\r\nstate of things, to a creative power independent of the general\r\nproperties of organisable matter such as we know them to-day?\" (p. 426)\r\n\r\nHe concluded that the action of environment, direct or indirect, was\r\ninsufficient to account for the diversity of organic forms, and rejected\r\nDarwin's theory completely. He thought it likely that the successive\r\nfaunas which palaeontology discloses have originated from one another by\r\ndescent. But he thought that the process by which they evolved should\r\nrightly be called \"creation.\" The word was of course not to be taken in\r\na crude sense. When the zoologist speaks of the \"creation\" of a new\r\nspecies, \"he in no way means that the latter has arisen from the dust,\r\nrather than from a pre-existing animal whose mode of organisation was\r\ndifferent; he merely means that the known properties of matter, whether\r\ninert or organic, are insufficient to bring about such a result, and\r\nthat the intervention of a hidden cause, of a power of some higher\r\norder, seems to him necessary\" (p. 429).\r\n\r\nThe criticism of Darwinism exercised by the older currents of thought\r\nremained on the whole without influence. It was under the direct\r\ninspiration of the Darwinian theory that morphology developed during the\r\nnext quarter of a century.\r\n\r\n    [333] Radl, _loc. cit._, i., p. 71.\r\n\r\n    [334] _Kritik der Urtheilskraft_, 1790.\r\n\r\n    [335] Eng.

The main principle upon which this work was\r\nbased was the principle of connections, so clearly stated by Geoffroy.\r\nThe principle of connections served as a guide in the search for the\r\narchetype, and this search was prosecuted in two directions--first, by\r\nthe comparison of adult structure; and second, by the comparative study\r\nof developing embryos. It was found that the archetype was shown most\r\nclearly by the early embryo, and this embryological archetype came to be\r\npreferred before the archetype of comparative anatomy. It became\r\napparent also that the parts first formed (germ-layers) were of primary\r\nimportance for the establishing of homologies.\r\n\r\nWhile practically all morphologists were agreed as to the main\r\nprinciples of their science, they yet showed, as regards their general\r\nattitude to the problems of form, a fairly definite division into two\r\ngroups, of which one laid stress upon the intimate relation existing\r\nbetween form and function, while the other disregarded function\r\ncompletely, and sought to build up a \"pure\" or abstract morphology. In\r\nopposition to both groups, in opposition really to morphology\r\naltogether, a movement had gained strength which tended towards the\r\nanalysis and disintegration of the organism. This movement took its\r\norigin in the current materialism of the day, and found expression\r\nparticularly in the cell-theory and in materialistic physiology.\r\n\r\nThe separation between morphology as the science of form and physiology\r\nas the science of the physics and chemistry of the living body had by\r\nDarwin's day become well-nigh absolute.\r\n\r\nThe morphology of the 'fifties lent itself readily to evolutionary\r\ninterpretation. Darwin found it easy to give a formal solution of all\r\nthe main problems which pre-evolutionary morphology had set--he was able\r\nto interpret the natural system of classification as being in reality\r\ngenealogical, systematic relationship as being really\r\nblood-relationship; he was able to interpret homology and analogy in\r\nterms of heredity and adaptation; he was able to explain the unity of\r\nplan by descent from a common ancestor, and for the concept of\r\n\"archetype\" to substitute that of \"ancestral form.\"\r\n\r\nThe current morphology, Darwin found, could be taken over, lock, stock\r\nand barrel, to the evolutionary camp.\r\n\r\nIn what follows we shall see that the coming of evolution made\r\nsurprisingly little difference to morphology, that the same methods were\r\nconsciously or unconsciously followed, the same mental attitudes taken\r\nup, after as before the publication of the _Origin of Species_.\r\n\r\nDarwin himself was not a professional morphologist; the conversion of\r\nmorphology to evolutionary ideas was carried out principally by his\r\nfollowers, Ernst Haeckel and Carl Gegenbaur in Germany, Huxley,\r\nLankester, and F. M. Balfour in England.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1866 that Haeckel's chief work appeared, a _General Morphology\r\nof Organisms_,[366] which was intended by its author to bring all\r\nmorphology under the sway and domination of evolution.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious production, this first book of Haeckel's, and\r\nrepresentative not so much of Darwinian as of pre-Darwinian thought. It\r\nwas a medley of dogmatic materialism, idealistic morphology, and\r\nevolution theory; its sources were, approximately, Buechner, Theodor\r\nSchwann, Virchow, H. G. Bronn, and, of course, Charles Darwin.\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely modern even on its first appearance, and many regarded\r\nit, not without reason, as a belated offshoot of _Naturphilosophie_.\r\n\r\nIts materialism is of the most intransigent character. The form and\r\nactivities of living things are held to be merely the mechanical result\r\nof the physical and chemical composition of their bodies. The simplest\r\nliving things, the Monera, are nothing more than homogeneous masses of\r\nprotein substance. \"They live, but without organs of life; all the\r\nphenomena of their life, nutrition and reproduction, movement and\r\nirritability, appear here as merely the immediate outcome of formless\r\norganic matter, itself an albumen compound\" (p. 63, 1906).\r\n\r\nTeleology, the Achilles' heel of Kant's (otherwise sound!) philosophy,\r\nis to be regarded as a totally refuted and antiquated doctrine,\r\ndefinitely put out of court by Darwinism.\r\n\r\nHaeckel works out his materialistic philosophy of living things very\r\nmuch after the fashion of Schwann. There is the same talk of cells as\r\norganic crystals, of crystal trees, of the analogy between assimilation\r\nby the cell and the growth of crystals in a mother liquid. Heredity and\r\nadaptation are shown equally as well by crystals as by organisms; for\r\nheredity, or the internal _Bildungstrieb_ (!), is the mechanical effect\r\nof the material structure of the crystal or the germ, and adaptation, or\r\nthe external _Bildungstrieb_, is a name for the modifications induced by\r\nthe environment. Adaptation so defined comes to be synonymous with the\r\nfortuitous variation which plays so great a part in Darwin's theory of\r\nnatural selection.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that Haeckel allowed to the organism no other nor\r\nhigher individuality than belongs to the crystal, and took no account at\r\nall of that harmonious interaction of the organs which Cuvier called the\r\nprinciple of the \"conditions of existence.\" The concept of correlation\r\nhad simply no meaning for Haeckel. The analysis and disintegration of\r\nthe organism was pushed by him to its logical extreme, and in this also\r\nhe was a child of his time.\r\n\r\nA no less important influence clearly visible in the _General\r\nMorphology_ is the idealistic morphology of men like K. G. Carus and H. G.\r\nBronn. In previous chapters we have seen how K. G. Carus attempted to\r\nwork out a geometry of the organism, and how Bronn tried in a modest way\r\nto found a stereometrical morphology, but had the grace not to push his\r\nstereometry _a l'outrance_, recognising very wisely that the greater\r\npart of organic form is functionally determined. Haeckel took over this\r\nidea[367] and pushed it to wild extremes, founding a new science of\r\n\"Promorphology\" of which he was the greatest--and only--exponent.[368]\r\n\r\nThis \"science\" dealt with axes and planes, poles and angles, in a\r\nveritable orgy of barbarous technical terms. It was intended to be a\r\n\"crystallography of the organic,\" and to lay the foundations of a\r\nmechanistic morphology, or morphography at least.\r\n\r\nHow it was to be linked up with the physics and chemistry of living\r\nmatter on the one hand and with the ordinary morphology of real animals\r\non the other, was never made quite clear.\r\n\r\nThe science of Promorphology has no historical significance; it is\r\ninteresting only because it illustrates Haeckel's close affinity with\r\nthe idealistic morphologists.\r\n\r\nAnother abortive science of Haeckel's, the science of Tectology, was\r\nequally a heritage from idealistic morphology. Tectology is the science\r\nof the composition of organisms from individuals of different orders.\r\nThere were six orders of individuals:--(1) Plastids (Cytodes and cells);\r\n(2) Organs (including cell-fusions, tissues, organs, organ-systems); (3)\r\nAntimeres (homotypic parts, _i.e._, halves or rays); (4) Metameres\r\n(homodynamic parts, _i.e._, segments); (5) Persons (individuals in the\r\nordinary sense); (6) Corms (colonial animals).\r\n\r\nThe thought is essentially transcendental, and recalls the \"theory of\r\nthe repetition of parts,\" of which so much use was made by the German\r\ntranscendentalists, such as Goethe,[369] Oken, Meckel and K. G. Carus, as\r\nwell as by Duges.\r\n\r\nThe third, and naturally the most important, ingredient in the _General\r\nMorphology_ was the doctrine of evolution, in the form given to it by\r\nDarwin. We have here no concern with Haeckel's evolutionary philosophy,\r\nwith the way in which he combined his evolutionism and his materialism\r\nto form a queer Monism of his own. We are interested only in the way he\r\napplied evolution to morphology, what modifications he introduced into\r\nthe principles of the science, and in general in what way he interpreted\r\nthe facts and theories of morphology in the light of the new knowledge.\r\n\r\nWe find that he repeats very much what Darwin said, giving, of course,\r\nmore detail to the exposition, and elaborating, particularly in his\r\nrecapitulation theory or \"biogenetic law,\" certain doctrines not\r\nexplicitly stated by Darwin.\r\n\r\nLike Darwin he held that the natural system is in reality genealogical.\r\n\"There exists,\" he writes, \"one single connected natural system of\r\norganisms, and this single natural system is the expression of real\r\nrelations which actually exist between all organisms, alike those now in\r\nbeing on the earth and those that have existed there in some past time.\r\nThe real relations which unite all living and extinct organisms in one\r\nor other of the principal groups of the natural system, are\r\ngenealogical: their relationship in form is blood-relationship; the\r\nnatural system is accordingly the genealogical tree of organisms, or\r\ntheir genealogema.... All organisms are in the last resort descendants\r\nof autogenous Monera, evolved as a consequence of the divergence of\r\ncharacters through natural selection. The different subordinate groups\r\nof the natural system, the categories of the class, order, family,\r\ngenus, etc., are larger or smaller branches of the genealogical tree,\r\nand the degree of their divergence indicates the degree of genealogical\r\naffinity of the related organisms with one another and with the common\r\nancestral form\" (ii., p. 420).\r\n\r\nThe degree of systematic relationship is thus the degree of genealogical\r\naffinity. It follows that the natural system of classification may be\r\nconverted straightway into a genealogical tree, and this is actually\r\nwhat Haeckel does in the _General Morphology_. The genealogical trees\r\ndepicted in the second volume (plates i.-viii.) are nothing more than\r\ngraphic representations of the ordinary systematic relationships of\r\norganisms, with a few hypothetical ancestral groups or forms thrown in\r\nto give the whole a genealogical turn.\r\n\r\nIf the genealogical tree is truly represented by the natural system, it\r\nwould seem that for each genus a single ancestral form must be\r\npostulated, for each group of genera a single more primitive form, and\r\nso in general for each of the higher classificatory categories, right up\r\nto the phylum. Species of one genus must be descended from a generic\r\nancestral form, genera of one family from a single family _Urform_, and\r\nso on for the higher categories.\r\n\r\nThis consequence was explicitly recognised by Haeckel. \"Genera and\r\nfamilies,\" he writes, \"as the next highest systematic grades, are\r\nextinct species which have resolved themselves into a divergent bunch of\r\nforms (_Formenbueschel_)\" (ii., p. 420).\r\n\r\nThe archetype of the genus, family, order, class and phylum was thus\r\nconceived to have had at some past time a real existence.\r\n\r\nThe natural system of classification is based upon a proper appreciation\r\nof the distinction between homological and analogical characters.\r\nHaeckel, following Darwin, naturally interprets the former as due to\r\ninheritance, the latter as due to adaptation, using these words, we may\r\nnote, in their accepted meaning and not in the abstract empty sense he\r\nhad previously attributed to them.[370] Similarly the \"type of\r\norganisation,\" in von Baer's sense, was due to heredity, the \"grade of\r\ndifferentiation\" to adaptation.\r\n\r\nSo far Haeckel merely emphasised what Darwin had already said in the\r\n_Origin of Species_. But by his statement of the \"biogenetic law,\" and\r\nparticularly by the clever use he made of it, Haeckel went a step beyond\r\nDarwin, and exercised perhaps a more direct influence upon evolutionary\r\nmorphology than Darwin himself.\r\n\r\nHaeckel was not the original discoverer of the law of recapitulation. It\r\nhappened that a few years before the publication of Haeckel's _General\r\nMorphology_, a German doctor, Fritz Mueller by name, stationed in Brazil,\r\nhad been working on the development of Crustacea under the direct\r\ninspiration of Darwin's theory, and had published in 1864 a book[371] in\r\nwhich he showed that individual development gave a clue to ancestral\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nHe conceived that progressive evolution might take place in two\r\ndifferent ways. \"Descendants ... reach a new goal, either by deviating\r\nsooner or later whilst still on the way towards the form of their\r\nparents, or by passing along this course without deviation, but then\r\ninstead of standing still advancing still farther\" (Eng. trans., p.\r\n111). In the former case the developmental history of descendants agrees\r\nwith that of the ancestors only up to a certain point and then diverges.\r\n\"In the second case the entire development of the progenitors is also\r\npassed through by the descendants, and, therefore, so far as the\r\nproduction of a species depends upon this second mode of progress, the\r\nhistorical development of the species will be mirrored in its\r\ndevelopmental history\" (p. 112).\r\n\r\nOf course the recapitulation of ancestral history will be neither\r\nliteral nor extended. \"The historical record preserved in developmental\r\nhistory is gradually _effaced_ as the development strikes into a\r\nconstantly straighter course from the egg to the perfect animal, and it\r\nis frequently _sophisticated_ by the struggle for existence which the\r\nfree-living larvae have to undergo\" (p. 114).\r\n\r\nIt follows that \"the primitive history of a species will be preserved in\r\nits developmental history the more perfectly the longer the series of\r\nyoung stages through which it passes by uniform steps; and the more\r\ntruly, the less the mode of life of the young departs from that of the\r\nadults, and the less the peculiarities of the individual young states\r\ncan be conceived as transferred back from later ones in previous periods\r\nof life, or as independently acquired\" (p. 121).\r\n\r\nApplying these principles to Crustacea, he concluded that the shrimp\r\n_Peneus_ with its long direct development gave the best and truest\r\npicture of the ancestral history of the Malacostraca, and that\r\naccordingly the nauplius and the zoaea larvae represented important\r\nancestral stages. He conceived it possible so to link up the various\r\nlarval forms of Crustacea as to weave a picture of the primeval history\r\nof the class, and he made a plucky attempt to work out the phylogeny of\r\nthe various groups.\r\n\r\nThe thought that development repeats evolution was already implicit in\r\nthe first edition of the _Origin_, but the credit for the first clear\r\nand detailed exposition of it belongs to F. Mueller.\r\n\r\nIn much the same form as it was propounded by Mueller it was adopted by\r\nHaeckel, and made the corner-stone of his evolutionary embryology.\r\nHaeckel gave it more precise and more technical formulation, but added\r\nnothing essentially new to the idea.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to use his term for it--the biogenetic law\r\n(_Biogenetische Grundgesetz_)--to distinguish it from the laws of\r\nMeckel-Serres and von Baer, with which it is so often confused.\r\n\r\nHaeckel's statement of it may best be summarised in his own words,\r\n\"Ontogeny, or the development of the organic individual, being the\r\nseries of form-changes which each individual organism traverses during\r\nthe whole time of its individual existence, is immediately conditioned\r\nby phylogeny, or the development of the organic stock (phylon) to which\r\nit belongs.\r\n\r\n\"Ontogeny is the short and rapid recapitulation of phylogeny,\r\nconditioned by the physiological functions of heredity (reproduction)\r\nand adaptation (nutrition). The organic individual (as a morphological\r\nindividual of the first to the sixth order) repeats during the rapid and\r\nshort course of its individual development the most important of the\r\nform-changes which its ancestors traversed during the long and slow\r\ncourse of their palaeontological evolution according to the laws of\r\nheredity and adaptation.\r\n\r\n\"The complete and accurate repetition of phyletic by biontic development\r\nis obliterated and abbreviated by secondary contraction, as ontogeny\r\nstrikes out for itself an ever straighter course; accordingly, the\r\nrepetition is the more complete the longer the series of young stages\r\nsuccessively passed through.\r\n\r\n\"The complete and, accurate repetition of phyletic by biontic\r\ndevelopment is falsified and altered by secondary adaptation, in that\r\nthe bion[372] during its individual development adapts itself to new\r\nconditions: accordingly the repetition is the more accurate the greater\r\nthe resemblance between the conditions of existence under which\r\nrespectively the bion and its ancestors developed\" (ii., p. 300).\r\n\r\nThe last two propositions, it will be observed, are taken over almost\r\nverbally from F. Mueller.\r\n\r\nNow we have seen that the natural system of classification gives a true\r\npicture of the genealogical relationships of organisms, that the smaller\r\nand larger classificatory groups correspond to greater or lesser\r\nbranches of the genealogical tree. If ontogeny is a recapitulation of\r\nphylogeny, we must expect to find the embryo repeating the organisation\r\nfirst of the ancestor of the phylum, then of the ancestor of the class,\r\nthe order, the family and the genus to which it belongs. There must be a\r\nthreefold parallelism between the natural system, ontogeny and phylogeny\r\n(ii., pp. 421-2).\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that there is here implied an analogy between the\r\nbiogenetic law and the law of von Baer, for both assert that development\r\nproceeds from the general to the special, that the farther back in\r\ndevelopment you go the more generalised do you find the structure of the\r\nembryo; both assert, too, that differentiation of structure takes place\r\nnot in one progressive or regressive line, but in several diverging\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nBut the analogy between the biogenetic law and the Meckel-Serres law is\r\neven more obvious, and the resemblance between the two is much more\r\nfundamental. It is a significant fact that in his theory of the\r\nthreefold parallelism Haeckel merely resuscitated in an evolutionary\r\nform a doctrine widely discussed in the 'forties and 'fifties,[373] and\r\nchampioned particularly by L. Agassiz,[374] a doctrine which must be\r\nregarded as a development or expansion of the Meckel-Serres law.[375] It\r\nis the view that a parallelism exists between the natural system,\r\nembryonic development, and palaeontological succession. Actually, as\r\nAgassiz stated it, the doctrine applied neither to types, nor as a\r\ngeneral rule to classes, but merely to orders. It was well exemplified,\r\nhe thought, in Crinoids:--\"The successive stages of the embryonic growth\r\nof Crinoids typify, as it were, the principal forms of Crinoids which\r\ncharacterise the successive geological formations. First, it recalls the\r\nCistoids of the palaeozoic rocks, which are represented in its simple\r\nspheroidal head; next the few-plated Platycrinoids of the Carboniferous\r\nperiod; next the Pentacrinoids of the Lias and Oolite with their whorls\r\nof cirrhi; and finally, when freed from its stem, it stands as the\r\nhighest Crinoid, as the prominent type of the family in the present\r\nperiod\" (p. 171).\r\n\r\nThe Meckel-Serres law, it will be remembered, expressed the idea that\r\nthe higher animals repeat in their ontogeny the adult organisation of\r\nanimals lower in the scale. Since Haeckel recognised clearly that a\r\nlinear arrangement of the animal kingdom was a mere perversion of\r\nreality, and that a branching arrangement of groups more truly\r\nrepresented the real relations of animals to one another, he could not\r\nof course entertain the Meckel-Serres theory in its original form. But\r\nhe accepted the main tenet of it when he asserted that each stage of\r\nontogeny had its counterpart in an adult ancestral form. Such ancestral\r\nforms might or might not be in existence as real species at the present\r\nday; they might or might not be discoverable as fossils. That they had\r\nreal existence either now or at some past epoch Haeckel never doubted.\r\nIn his construction of phylogenetic trees he was so confident in the\r\ntruth of his biogenetic law that he largely disregarded and consistently\r\nminimised the importance of the evidence from palaeontology.\r\n\r\nThe biogenetic law differed from the Meckel-Serres law chiefly in the\r\ncircumstance that many of the adult lower forms whose organisation was\r\nsupposed to be repeated in the development of the higher animals were\r\npurely hypothetical, being deduced directly from a study of ontogeny and\r\nsystematic relationships. The hypothetical ancestral forms which the\r\ntheory thus postulated naturally took their place in the natural system,\r\nfor they were merely the concrete projections or archetypes of the\r\nclassificatory groups.\r\n\r\nThe transcendentalists, of course, conceived evolution, whether real or\r\nideal, as a uniserial process, whereas Haeckel conceived it as\r\nmultiserial and divergent. It is here that the superficial agreement of\r\nthe biogenetic law with the law of von Baer comes in.\r\n\r\nWe might almost sum up the relation of the biogenetic law to the laws of\r\nvon Baer and Meckel-Serres by saying that it was the Meckel-Serres law\r\napplied to the divergent differentiation upheld by von Baer instead of\r\nto the uniserial progression believed in by the transcendentalists.\r\n\r\nHow near in practice Haeckel's law came to the recapitulation theory of\r\nthe transcendentalists may be seen in passages like the following, with\r\nits partial recognition of the _Echelle_ idea:[276]--\"As so high and\r\ncomplicated an organism as that of man ... rises upwards from a simple\r\ncellular state, and as it progresses in its differentiating and\r\nperfecting, it passes through the same series of transformations which\r\nits animal progenitors have passed through, during immense spaces of\r\ntime, inconceivable ages ago.... Certain very early and low stages in\r\nthe development of man, and other vertebrate animals in general,\r\ncorrespond completely in many points of structure with conditions which\r\nlast for life in the lower fishes. The next phase which follows on this\r\npresents us with a change of the fish-like being into a kind of\r\namphibious animal. At a later period the mammal, with its special\r\ncharacteristics, develops out of the amphibian, and we can clearly see,\r\nin the successive stages of its later development, a series of steps of\r\nprogressive transformation which evidently correspond with the\r\ndifferences of different mammalian orders and families.\"[377]\r\n\r\nThe biogenetic law went beyond both the Meckel-Serres law and the law of\r\nvon Baer in that it recognised that the ancestral history of the species\r\naccounts in part for the course which the development of the individual\r\ntakes, that in a certain sense, though not in the crude way supposed by\r\nHaeckel, phylogeny is the cause of ontogeny. This thought, that the\r\norganism is before all an historical being, is of course implied in the\r\nevolution idea, is indeed the essential core of it. Take away this\r\nelement from the biogenetic law--not a difficult matter--and it becomes\r\nmerely a law of idealistic morphology, applicable to evolution\r\nconsidered as an ideal process, as the progressive development in the\r\nDivine thought of archetypal models.\r\n\r\nAs a book, the _General Morphology_ suffers a good deal from the arid,\r\nschematic, almost scholastic manner of exposition adopted. Haeckel's\r\nPrussian mania for organisation, for absolute distinctions, for\r\niron-bound formalism, is here given full scope. A treatment less\r\nadequate to the variety, fluidity and changeableness of living things\r\ncould hardly be imagined.\r\n\r\nHis doctrine, though it remains essentially unchanged, receives in his\r\nlater works a less formal and more concrete expression, and, in\r\nparticular, his views on the biogenetic law undergo some small\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nEven in the _General Morphology_ Haeckel had recognised that ontogeny is\r\nneither a complete nor an entirely accurate recapitulation of phylogeny;\r\nhe had admitted, following F. Mueller, that the true course of\r\nrecapitulation was frequently modified by larval and foetal adaptations.\r\nAs time went on, he was forced to hedge more and more on this point, and\r\nfinally in his _Anthropogenie_ (1874) and his second paper on the\r\nGastraea theory (1875),[378] he had to work out a distinction between\r\npalingenetic and cenogenetic characters, of which much use was made by\r\nsubsequent writers.\r\n\r\nThe distinction may be given in Haeckel's own words:--\"Those ontogenetic\r\nprocesses,\" he writes, \"which are to be referred immediately, in\r\naccordance with the biogenetic law, to an earlier completely developed\r\n_independent ancestral form_, and are transmitted from this by\r\n_heredity_, obviously possess _primary_ importance for the understanding\r\nof the casual-physiological relations; on the other hand, those\r\ndevelopmental processes which appear subsequently through _adaptation_\r\nto the needs of embryonic or larval life, and accordingly can _not_ be\r\nregarded as repeating the organisation of an earlier independent\r\nancestral form, can clearly have for the understanding of the ancestral\r\nhistory only a quite subordinate and _secondary_ importance.\r\n\r\n\"The first I have named _palingenetic_, the second _cenogenetic_.\r\nConsidered from this critical standpoint, the whole of ontogeny falls\r\ninto two main parts:--First, _palingenesis_, or 'epitomised history'\r\n(_Auszugsgeschichte_), and second, _cenogenesis_, or 'counterfeit\r\nhistory' (_Faelschungsgeschichte_). The first is the true ontogenetic\r\nepitome or short recapitulation of past evolutionary history; the second\r\nis the exact contrary, a new foreign ingredient, a falsifying or\r\nconcealing of the epitome of phylogeny.\"[379]\r\n\r\nAs examples of palingenetic processes in the development of Amniotes,\r\nfor instance, may be quoted the separation of two primary germ-layers,\r\nthe formation of a simple notochord between medullary tube and\r\nalimentary canal, the appearance of a simple cartilaginous cranium, of\r\nthe gill-arches and their vessels, of the primitive kidneys, the\r\nprimitive tubular heart, the paired aortae and the cardinal veins, the\r\nhermaphroditic rudiment of the gonads, and so on. Cenogenetic processes,\r\non the other hand, include such phenomena as the formation of yolk and\r\nthe embryonic membranes, the temporary allantoic circulation, the navel,\r\nthe curved and contracted shape of the embryo, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe most important phenomena to be included under the general heading of\r\ncenogenesis are, first, the occurrence of food-yolk, and second, those\r\nanomalies of development which are classed by Haeckel as heterochronies\r\nand heterotopies.\r\n\r\nIt is to the influence of the different amounts of yolk present in the\r\negg that are due the great differences in the segmentation and\r\ngastrulation processes, which almost mask their true significance.\r\n\r\nHeterochronic processes are such as arise through the dislocation of the\r\nproper phylogenetic order of succession: heterotopic processes in the\r\nsame way are caused by a wandering of cells from one germ-layer to\r\nanother. The two classes of phenomena are disturbances either of the\r\nproper spatial or of the proper temporal relation of the parts during\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nHeterochrony shows itself, as a rule, either as an acceleration or as a\r\nretardation of developmental events, as compared with their relative\r\ntime of occurrence during phylogeny. Thus the notochord, the brain, the\r\neyes, the heart, appear earlier in the ontogenetic than in the\r\nphylogenetic series, while, on the other hand, the septum of the\r\nauricles appears in the development of the higher Vertebrates before the\r\nventricular septum, which is undoubtedly a reversal of the phylogenetic\r\norder.\r\n\r\nCases of heterotopy, or of organs being developed in a position or a\r\ngerm-layer other than that in which they originally arose in phylogeny,\r\nare not so easy to find. According to Haeckel, the origin of the\r\ngenerative products in the mesoderm is a heterotopic phenomenon, for he\r\nconsiders that they must have originated phylogenetically in one of the\r\ntwo primary layers, ectoderm or endoderm.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that the help of comparative anatomy is admittedly\r\nrequired in deciding what processes are palingenetic and what\r\ncenogenetic (p. 412).\r\n\r\nHaeckel's morphological notions, and particularly his biogenetic law,\r\nexcited a good deal of adverse criticism from men like His, Claus,\r\nSalensky, Semper and Goette. Nor was his principal work, the _General\r\nMorphology_, received with much favour. Nevertheless, since he did\r\nexpress, though in a crude, dogmatic and extreme manner, the main\r\nhypotheses upon which evolutionary morphology is founded, his historical\r\nimportance is considerable. He cannot perhaps be regarded as typical of\r\nthe morphologists of his time--he was too trenchantly materialistic, too\r\nmuch the populariser of a crude and commonplace philosophy of Nature. In\r\npoint of concrete achievement in the field of pure research he fell\r\nnotably behind many of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nHis friend, Carl Gegenbaur, who gained a great and well-deserved\r\nreputation by his masterly studies on vertebrate morphology,[380] was a\r\nsounder man, and probably exercised a wider and certainly a more\r\nwholesome influence upon the younger generation of professional\r\nmorphologists than the more brilliant Haeckel. It is true that in his\r\nfamous _Grundzuege der vergleichenden Anatomie_, the second edition of\r\nwhich, published in 1870, soon came to be regarded as the classical\r\ntext-book of evolutionary morphology, Gegenbaur enunciated very much the\r\nsame general principles as Haeckel, and referred to the _Generelle\r\nMorphologie_ as the chief and fundamental work on animal morphology. But\r\nin Gegenbaur's pages the Haeckelian doctrines are modified and subdued\r\nby the strong commonsense and thorough appreciation of the older\r\nclassical or Cuvierian morphology that characterise Gegenbaur's work.\r\nAccording to Haeckel,[381] Gegenbaur was greatly influenced by J. Mueller,\r\nwho, as we know, laid as much stress on function as on form.\r\n\r\nThe \"General Part\" of Gegenbaur's text-book is in many ways a\r\nsignificant document and deserves close attention.\r\n\r\nWe note first of all that physiology and morphology are considered by\r\nGegenbaur to be entirely distinct sciences, with different\r\nsubject-matter and different methods. \"The task of physiology is the\r\ninvestigation of the functions of the animal body or of its parts, the\r\nreferring back of these functions to elementary processes and their\r\nexplanation by general laws. The investigation of the material\r\nsubstratum of these functions, of the form of the body and its parts,\r\nand the explanation of this form, constitute the task of Morphology\"\r\n(2nd ed., p. 3).\r\n\r\nMorphology falls naturally into two divisions--comparative anatomy and\r\nembryology. The method of comparative anatomy is _comparison_ (p. 6),\r\nand in employing this method account is to be taken of \"the spatial\r\nrelations of the parts to one another, their number, extent, structure,\r\nand texture.\" Through comparison one is enabled to arrange organs in\r\ncontinuous series, and it comes out very clearly during this proceeding\r\n\"that the physiological value of an organ is by no means constant\r\nthroughout the different form-states of the organ, that an organ,\r\nthrough the mere modification of its anatomical relations, can subserve\r\nvery different functions. Exclusive regard for their physiological\r\nfunctions would place morphologically related organs in different\r\ncategories. From this it follows that in comparative anatomy we should\r\nnever in the first place consider the function of an organ. The\r\nphysiological value comes only in the second place into consideration,\r\nwhen we have to reconstruct the relations to the organism as a whole of\r\nthe modification which an organ has undergone as compared with another\r\nstate of it. In this way comparative anatomy shows us how to arrange\r\norgans in series; within these series we meet with variations which\r\nsometimes are insignificant and sometimes greater in extent; they affect\r\nthe extent, number, shape, and texture of the parts of an organ, and can\r\neven, though only in a slight degree, lead to alterations of position\"\r\n(p. 6).\r\n\r\nGeoffroy St Hilaire would have subscribed to every word of this\r\nvindication of his \"principle of connections.\"\r\n\r\nBetween comparative anatomy and embryology there exists a close\r\nconnection, for the one throws light on the other. \"While in some cases\r\nthe same organ shows only slight modifications in its development from\r\nits early beginnings to its perfect state, in other cases the organ is\r\nsubjected to manifold modifications before it reaches its definitive\r\nform; we see parts appear in it which later disappear, we observe\r\nalterations in it in all its anatomical relations, alterations which may\r\neven affect its texture. This fact is of great importance, for those\r\nchanges which an organ undergoes during its individual development lead\r\nthrough states which the organ in other cases permanently shows, or at\r\nthe least the first appearance of the organ is the equivalent of a\r\npermanent state in another organism. If then the fully developed organ\r\nis in any special case so greatly modified that its proper relation to\r\nsome organ-series is obscured, this relation may be cleared up by a\r\nknowledge of the organ's development. The earlier state indicated in\r\nthis way enables one to find with ease the proper place for the organ\r\nand so insert it into an already known series. The relations which we\r\nobserve in an organ-seriation are then the equivalent of processes which\r\nin certain cases take place in a similar manner during the individual\r\ndevelopment of an organ. Embryology enters therefore into the closest\r\nconnection with comparative anatomy.... It teaches us to know organs in\r\ntheir earliest states, and connects them up with the permanent states of\r\nothers, whereby they fill up the gaps which we meet with in the various\r\nseries formed by the fully developed organs of the body\" (pp. 6-7).\r\n\r\nThis recognition of the parallelism between comparative anatomy and\r\nembryology is, of course, the kernel of the Meckel-Serres law. For\r\nGegenbaur it had a very definite evolutionary meaning--he subscribed to\r\nthe evolutionary form of it, the biogenetic law. How near his conception\r\nof the relation between ontogeny and phylogeny came to the old\r\nMeckel-Serres law may be gauged from the following passage, taken from a\r\nlater work:--\"Ontogeny thus represents, to a certain degree,\r\npalaeontological development abbreviated or epitomised. The stages which\r\nare passed through by higher organisms in their ontogeny correspond to\r\nstages which are maintained in others as the definitive organisation.\r\nThese embryonic stages may accordingly be explained by comparing them\r\nwith the mature stages of lower organisms, since we regard them as forms\r\ninherited from ancestors belonging to such lower stages\"[382] (p. 6).\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that in Gegenbaur's opinion comparative anatomy was\r\nprior in importance to embryology, that embryology could hardly exist as\r\nan independent science, since it must seek the interpretation of its\r\nfacts always in the facts of comparative anatomy (_Grundzuege_, pp. 7-8).\r\n\r\nWhile Gegenbaur was at one with all \"pure\" morphologists, whether\r\nevolutionary or pre-evolutionary, in minimising as far as possible the\r\nimportance of function in the study of form, he was too cautious and\r\nsober a thinker not to recognise the immense part which function really\r\nplays. Thus he classified organs, according to their function, into\r\nthose that established relations with the external world and those that\r\nhad to do with nutrition and reproduction, very much as Bichat had done\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nLike Darwin, Haeckel and most evolutionists, he interpreted the\r\nhomological resemblances of animals as being due to heredity, their\r\ndifferences as due to adaptation,[383] but he did not adopt Haeckel's\r\ncrude and shallow definition of these terms. For Gegenbaur heredity was\r\na convenient expression for the fact of transmission, and was not\r\nexplained offhand as the mere mechanical result of a certain material\r\nstructure handed down from germ to germ. Adaptation he defined in a way\r\nwhich took the fullest account of function, and was as far as possible\r\nremoved from Haeckel's definition of it as the direct mechanical effect\r\nof the environment upon the organism. \"The organism is altered,\" writes\r\nGegenbaur, \"according to the conditions which influence it. The\r\nconsequent _Adaptations_ are to be regarded as gradual, but steadily\r\nprogressive, changes in the organisation, which are striven after during\r\nthe individual life of the organism, preserved by transmission in a\r\nseries of generations, and further developed by means of natural\r\nselection. What has been gained by the ancestor becomes the heritage of\r\nthe descendant. Adaptation and Transmission are thus alternately\r\neffective, the former representing the modifying, the latter the\r\nconservative principle.... Adaptation is commenced by a change in the\r\nfunction of organs, so that the _physiological relations_ of organs play\r\nthe most important part in it. Since adaptation is merely the material\r\nexpression of this change of function, the modification of the function\r\nas much as its expression is to be regarded as a gradual process. In\r\nAdaptation, the closest connection between the function and the\r\nstructure of an organ is thus indicated. Physiological functions govern,\r\nin a certain sense, structure; and so far what is morphological is\r\nsubordinated to what is physiological\" (_Elements_, pp. 8-9). Gegenbaur\r\nrecognised also that morphological differentiation depended largely on\r\nthe physiological division of labour (_Grundzuege_, p. 49).\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Gegenbaur realised vividly the importance of function,\r\nand in this respect, as in others, he is far beyond Haeckel. The same\r\nthing comes out markedly in his treatment of correlation. Haeckel had no\r\nslightest feeling for the true meaning of correlation. For him, as for\r\nDarwin, it reduced itself to a law of correlative variation, according\r\nto which \"actual adaptation not only changes those parts of the organism\r\nwhich are directly affected by its influence, but other parts also, not\r\ndirectly affected by it.\"[384] Such \"correlative adaptation\" was due to\r\nnutrition being a \"connected, centralised activity.\"\r\n\r\nGegenbaur, on the contrary, had a firm grasp of the Cuvierian\r\nconception, and expressed it in unmistakable terms. \"As indeed follows\r\nfrom the conception of life as the harmonious expression of a sum of\r\nphenomena rigorously determining one another, no activity of an organ\r\ncan in reality be thought of as existing for itself. Each kind of\r\nfunction (_Verrichtung_) presupposes a series of other functions, and\r\naccordingly every organ must possess close relations with, and be\r\ndependent on, all the others\" (_Grundzuege_, p. 71). The organism must be\r\nregarded as an individual whole which is as much conditioned by its\r\nparts as one part is conditioned by the others. For an understanding of\r\ncorrelation a knowledge of functions, and of the functional relations of\r\nthe organism to its environment, is clearly indispensable.\r\n\r\nGegenbaur's morphological system was out-and-out evolutionary. \"The most\r\nimportant part of the business of comparative anatomy,\" in Gegenbaur's\r\neyes, \"is to find indications of genetic connection in the organisation\r\nof the animal body\" (_Elements_, p. 67).\r\n\r\nThe most important clue to discovering this genetic connection is of\r\ncourse that given by homology; it is indeed the main principle of\r\nevolutionary morphology that what is common in organisation is due to\r\ncommon descent, what is divergent is due to adaptation. \"Homology ...\r\ncorresponds to the hypothetical genetic relationship. In the more or the\r\nless clear homology, we have the expression of the more or less intimate\r\ndegree of relationship. Blood-relationship becomes dubious exactly in\r\nproportion as the proof of homologies is uncertain\" (_Elements_, p. 63).\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that while Gegenbaur agrees with Haeckel generally\r\nthat morphological relationships are really genealogical, that, for\r\ninstance, each phylum has its ancestral form, he enters a caution\r\nagainst too hastily assuming the existence of a genetic relation between\r\ntwo forms on the basis of the comparison of one or two organs. \"In\r\ntreating comparative anatomy from the genealogical standpoint required\r\nby the evolution-theory,\" he writes, \"we have to take into consideration\r\nthe fact that the connections can almost never be discovered in the real\r\ngenealogically related objects, for we have almost always to do with the\r\ndivergent members of an evolutionary series. We derive, for instance,\r\nthe circulatory system of insects from that of Crustacea ... but there\r\nexists neither a form that leads directly from Crustacea to insects nor\r\nany organisatory state (_Organisationszustand_), which as such shows the\r\ntransition. Even when one point of organisation can be denoted as\r\ntransitional, numerous other points prevent us from regarding the whole\r\norganism strictly in the same light\" (_Grundzuege_, p. 75). The real\r\nancestral forms cannot, as a rule, be discovered among living species,\r\nnor often as extinct. \"When we arrange allied forms in series by means\r\nof comparison, and seek to derive the more complex from the simpler, we\r\nrecognise in the lower and simpler forms only similarities with the\r\nancestral form, which remains essentially hypothetical\" (p. 75).\r\n\r\nThe facts of development, Gegenbaur goes on to say, help us out greatly\r\nin our search for ancestral forms, for the early stages in the ontogeny\r\nof a highly organised animal give us some idea of the organisation of\r\nits original ancestor. Characters common to the early ontogeny of all\r\nthe members of a large group are particularly important in this respect\r\n(_cf._ von Baer's law).\r\n\r\nGegenbaur distinguishes homologous or morphologically equivalent\r\nstructures from such as are analogous or physiologically equivalent,\r\njust as did Owen and the older anatomists. Like von Baer he recognises\r\nhomologies, as a rule, only within the type.\r\n\r\nHe contributed, however, to the common stock a useful analysis of the\r\nconcept of homology, and established certain classes and degrees of it.\r\nHe distinguished first between general and special homology, in quite a\r\ndifferent sense from Owen.\r\n\r\nGeneral homology, in Gegenbaur's sense, relates to resemblances of\r\norgans within the organism, and includes four kinds of resemblance,\r\nhomotypy, homodynamy, homonomy and homonymy. Right and left organs are\r\nhomotypic, metameric organs are homodynamic; homonomy is the relation\r\nexemplified by fin-rays or fingers, which are arranged with reference to\r\na transverse axis of the body; homonymy is a sort of metamerism in\r\nsecondary parts (not the main axis) of the body, and is shown by the\r\nvarious divisions of the appendages (_Grundzuege_, p. 80).\r\n\r\nSpecial homology, on the other hand, relates to resemblances between\r\norgans in different animals. The interesting thing is that Gegenbaur\r\ndefines it genetically. Special homology is the name we give \"to the\r\nrelations which obtain between two organs which have had a common\r\norigin, and which have also a common embryonic history\" (_Elements_, p.\r\n64). This is his definition; but, in practice, Gegenbaur establishes\r\nhomologies by comparison just as the older anatomists did, and infers\r\ncommon descent from homology, not homology from common descent.\r\n\r\n\"Special homology,\" he continues, \"must be again separated into\r\nsub-divisions, according as the organs dealt with are essentially\r\nunchanged in their morphological characters, or are altered by the\r\naddition or removal of parts\" (p. 65). In the former case the homology\r\nis said to be \"complete,\" in the latter \"incomplete.\" Thus the bones of\r\nthe upper arm are completely homologous throughout all vertebrate\r\nclasses from Amphibia upwards, while the heart of a fish is incompletely\r\nhomologous with the heart of a mammal.\r\n\r\nIndependently of Gegenbaur, Sir E. Ray Lankester proposed in 1870 a\r\ngenetic definition of homology.[385] He proposed, indeed, to do away with\r\nthe term homology altogether, on the ground that it included many\r\nresemblances which were obviously not due to common descent--as, for\r\ninstance, the resemblance of metameres. So, too, organs which were\r\nhomologous in the ordinary sense, as the heart of birds and mammals,\r\nmight have arisen separately in evolution. He proposed, therefore, that\r\n\"structures which are genetically related, in so far as they have a\r\nsingle representative in a common ancestor,\" should be called\r\n_homogenous_(p. 36). All other resemblances were to be called\r\n_homoplastic_. \"Homoplasy includes all cases of close resemblance of\r\nform which are not traceable to homogeny, all details of agreement not\r\nhomogenous, in structures which are broadly homogenous, as well as in\r\nstructures having no genetic affinity\" (p. 41). Serial homology, for\r\ninstance, was a case of homoplasy.\r\n\r\nThe term \"analogy\" was to be retained for cases of functional\r\nresemblance, whether homogenetic or not.\r\n\r\nThe attempt was an interesting one, but most morphologists wisely\r\nadhered to the old concept of homology, in spite of Lankester's\r\ndeclaration that this belonged to an older \"Platonic\" philosophy, and\r\nought to be superseded by a term more consonant with the new philosophy\r\nof evolution.\r\n\r\n    [366] _Generelle Morphologie der Organismen.

The period from about 1865 to 1885\r\nmight well be called the second speculative or transcendental period of\r\nmorphology, differing only from the first period of transcendentalism by\r\nthe greater bulk of its positive achievement. It must be remembered that\r\nthe later workers (at least towards the end of this period) had immense\r\nadvantages over their predecessors in the matter of equipment and\r\ntechnique; they possessed well-fitted laboratories in the university\r\ntowns and by the sea; they had at their command perfected microscopes\r\nand microtomes; while the whole new technique of microscopical anatomy\r\nwith its endless variety of stains and reagents made it possible for the\r\ntyro to confirm in a day what von Baer and Mueller had taken weeks of\r\npainful endeavour to discover.[386] But the democratisation of morphology\r\nwhich followed upon the facilitation of its means of research left an\r\nevil heritage of detailed and unintelligent work to counterbalance the\r\nvery great and real advances which technical improvements alone rendered\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThis period of rapid development, which set in soon after the coming of\r\nevolution and multiplied the concrete facts of morphology an\r\nhundredfold, may for our present purpose be conveniently divided into\r\ntwo somewhat overlapping periods, of which the second may be said to\r\nbegin with the enunciation by Haeckel of his Gastraea theory. Within the\r\nfirst period fall the evolutionary speculations associated with the\r\nnames of Kowalevsky, Dohrn, Semper, and others; the characteristic of\r\nthe second period is the preponderating influence exercised upon\r\nphylogenetic speculations by the germ-layer doctrine in its two main\r\nevolutionary developments, the Gastraea and Coelom theories.\r\n\r\nIn the first period we might again distinguish two main tendencies,\r\naccording as speculations were based mainly upon anatomical or mainly\r\nupon embryological considerations, and it so happens that these two\r\ntendencies are very well illustrated by the various theories as to the\r\norigin of Vertebrates which began to appear towards the 'seventies. We\r\nshall accordingly, in this chapter, consider very briefly the history of\r\nthe earlier views on the phylogeny of the vertebrate stock.\r\n\r\nIn the early days, before the other claimants to the dignity of\r\nancestral form to the Vertebrates--_Balanoglossus_, Nemertines and the\r\nrest--had put in an appearance, there were two main views on the\r\nsubject, one upheld by Haeckel, Kowalevsky and others, to the effect\r\nthat the proximate ancestor of Vertebrates was a form somewhat\r\nresembling the ascidian tadpole, the other supported principally by\r\nDohrn and Semper that Vertebrates and Arthropods traced their descent to\r\na common segmented annelid or pro-annelid ancestor. The former view is\r\nhistorically prior, and arose directly out of the brilliant\r\nembryological investigations of A. Kowalevsky, who proved himself to be\r\na worthy successor of the great comparative embryologist Rathke. His\r\nwork was indeed a true continuation of Rathke's. It was not directly\r\ninspired by evolution, though it supplied much useful confirmation of\r\nthe theory--you may read Kowalevsky's earlier memoirs and not realise\r\nthat they were written several years after the publication of the\r\n_Origin of Species_.\r\n\r\nHis first paper of evolutionary importance was a note in Russian on the\r\ndevelopment of Amphioxus, published in 1865. This subject was followed\r\nup in two papers which appeared in 1867[387] and 1877.[388] In his\r\npapers on Amphioxus Kowalevsky made out the main features in the\r\ndevelopment of this primitive form, and showed that the chief organs\r\nwere formed in essentially the same way as in Vertebrates; he described\r\nthe formation of the archenteron by invagination, the appearance of the\r\nmedullary folds, which coalesced to form the neural canal, the formation\r\nof the notochord and of the gill-slits. At first he made the mistake of\r\nsupposing that the body-cavity arose from the segmentation-cavity, but\r\nin his later paper he rightly surmised that it was formed from the\r\ncavities of the \"primitive vertebrae,\" or mesodermal segments. The origin\r\nof the notochord from the endoderm was also not made out by Kowalevsky\r\nin his paper of 1867.\r\n\r\nAlthough many important details remained to be discovered by later\r\ninvestigators,[389] Kowalevsky's work at once made the development of\r\nAmphioxus the key to vertebrate embryology, the typical ontogeny with\r\nwhich all others could be compared.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in 1866 and 1871, Kowalevsky had communicated memoirs of even\r\ngreater interest,[390] in which he showed that the simple Ascidians\r\ndeveloped in an extraordinarily similar way to Amphioxus and hence to\r\nVertebrates in general. His proof that Ascidians also develop on the\r\nvertebrate type aroused great interest at the time, and was naturally\r\nacclaimed by the evolutionists as a striking piece of evidence in favour\r\nof their doctrine. The systematic position of the Ascidians was at that\r\ntime quite uncertain; they were grouped, as a rule, with the Mollusca,\r\nand certainly no one suspected that their well-known tailed larvae, first\r\nseen by Savigny, showed any but the most superficial analogy with the\r\ntadpoles of Amphibia. Kowalevsky's papers put a different complexion on\r\nthe matter. In the first of them he showed how the nervous system of the\r\nsimple Ascidian developed from ectodermal folds just as it did in\r\nAmphioxus and Vertebrates, how gill-slits were formed in the walls of\r\nthe pharynx, and how there existed in the ascidian larva a structure\r\nwhich in position and mode of development was the strict homologue of\r\nthe vertebrate notochord. In his second paper he entered into much more\r\ndetail, and published some excellent figures, often reproduced since\r\n(see Fig. 13), but the proof of the affinity between Vertebrates and\r\nAscidians was in all essentials complete in his paper of 1866.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Development of the Ascidian Larva. (After\r\nKowalevsky.)]\r\n\r\nKowalevsky's results were accepted by Haeckel, Gegenbaur, Darwin,[391]\r\nand many others as conclusive evidence of the origin of Vertebrates\r\nfrom a form resembling the ascidian tadpole; they were extended and\r\namplified by Kupffer[392] in 1870, later by van Beneden and Julin[393]\r\nand numerous other workers; they were adversely criticised by\r\nMetschnikoff[394] and von Baer,[395] as well as by H. de\r\nLacaze-Duthiers and A. Giard.[396] Lacaze-Duthiers and von Baer both\r\nheld fast to the old view that Ascidians were directly comparable with\r\nLamellibranch molluscs; they denied the homology of the ascidian\r\nnervous system with that of Vertebrates, von Baer being at great pains\r\nto show that the ascidian nerve-centre was really ventral in position.\r\nHe pointed out also that the \"notochord\" was confined to the tail of\r\nthe ascidian larva. Giard's attitude was by no means so\r\nuncompromising, and the criticisms he passed on the Kowalevsky theory\r\nare both subtle and instructive. He admits that there exists a real\r\nhomology between, for instance, the notochord of Vertebrates and that\r\nof Ascidians. \"But,\" he adds, \"it is too often forgotten that homology\r\ndoes not necessarily mean an immediate common origin or close\r\nrelationship. There exist, doubtless, homologies of great atavistic\r\nimportance--I consider as such, for example, the formation of the\r\ncavity of Rusconi [the archenteron] in Ascidians and lower\r\nVertebrates. But there are also adaptive and purely analogical\r\nhomologies, such as the interdigital palmation of aquatic birds,\r\namphibians and mammals. These are not purely analogous organs, for\r\nthey can be superposed one on another, which is not the case with\r\nsimply analogous structures (the bat's wing, for example, cannot be\r\nsuperposed on the bird's wing); they are homologous formations,\r\nresulting from the adaptation of the same fundamental organs to\r\nidentical functions. Such is, in my opinion, the nature of the\r\nhomology existing between the tail of the ascidian tadpole and that of\r\nAmphioxus or of young amphibians. The ascidian larva, having no cilia\r\nand being necessarily motile, requires for the insertion of its\r\nmuscles or contractile organs ... a central flexible axis, a true\r\nchorda dorsalis analogous to that of Vertebrates\" (pp. 278-9). This\r\npoint of view is strengthened by the fact that in _Molgula_, studied\r\nby Lacaze-Duthiers, the embryo is practically stationary, and forms no\r\nnotochord, nor ever develops sense-organs in the cerebral vesicle.\r\n\r\nGiard's general conclusion is that \"the true homology with Vertebrates\r\nceases after the formation of the cavity of Rusconi and the medullary\r\ngroove: the homologies established by Kowalevsky for the notochord and\r\nthe relations of the digestive tube and nervous systems are not\r\natavistic, but adaptive, homologies\" (p. 282). There is accordingly no\r\nclose genetic relationship between Ascidians and Vertebrates.\r\n\r\nGiard's criticisms did not avail to check the vogue of the new theory,\r\nwhich soon became an accepted article of faith in most morphological\r\ncircles.[397] The fall of the Ascidians from their larval high estate\r\nprovided the text for many a Darwinian sermon.\r\n\r\nSome years after the genetic relationship of Ascidians and Vertebrates\r\nhad been established, a rival theory of the origin of Vertebrates made\r\nits appearance--a theory which was practically a rehabilitation in a\r\nsomewhat altered form of the old Geoffroyan conception that Vertebrates\r\nare Arthropods walking on their backs. This was the so-called Annelid\r\ntheory of Dohrn and Semper. Both Dohrn and Semper started out from the\r\nfact that Annelids and Vertebrates are alike segmented animals, and it\r\nwas an essential part of their theory that this resemblance was due to\r\ndescent from a common segmented ancestor. Both laid great stress on the\r\nfact that the main organs in Vertebrates are arranged in the same way as\r\nin an Annelid lying on its back, the nervous system being uppermost, the\r\nalimentary system coming next, and below this the vascular.\r\n\r\nDohrn's earlier views are contained in the fascinating little book\r\npublished in 1875, which bears the title _Der Ursprung der Wirbelthiere\r\nund das Princip des Functionswechsel_ (Leipzig). He followed this up by\r\na long series of studies on vertebrate anatomy and embryology,[398] in\r\nwhich he modified his views in certain details. We shall confine our\r\nattention to the first sketch of his theory.\r\n\r\nIf the Vertebrate is conceived to have evolved from a primitive Annelid\r\nwhich took to creeping or swimming ventral surface uppermost, a\r\ndifficulty at once arises with regard to the relative positions of the\r\n\"brain\" and the mouth. In Vertebrates the brain, like the rest of the\r\nnervous system, is dorsal to the mouth and the alimentary canal; in an\r\ninverted Annelid, however, the brain is ventral to the mouth and is\r\nconnected with the dorsal nerve cord by commissures passing round the\r\noesophagus. It would seem, therefore, that the primitive Vertebrate must\r\nhave acquired either a new brain or a new mouth. Dohrn took the latter\r\nview. He supposed that the original mouth of the primitive ancestor lay\r\nbetween the _crura cerebelli_ in the _fossa rhomboidea_, and that in\r\nVertebrates this mouth has been replaced functionally by a new ventrally\r\nplaced mouth, formed by the medial coalescence of a pair of\r\ngill-slits.[399] Probably the two mouths at one period co-existed, and the\r\nolder one was ousted by the growing functional importance of the newer\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nThe gill-slits were considered by Dohrn to be derived from the segmental\r\norgans of Annelids, which were present originally in every segment of\r\nthe primitive ancestor. The gills were at first external, like the gills\r\nof many Chaetopods at the present day. For their support cartilaginous\r\ngill-arches naturally arose in the body-wall, and the superficial\r\nmusculature became attached to these bars. \"There existed in all the\r\nsegments of the Annelid-ancestors of Vertebrates gills with\r\ncartilaginous skeleton and gill-arches in the body wall. Each gill had\r\nits veins and arteries, each had its branch of the ventral nerve-cord,\r\nand between each successive pair of gills a segmental organ opened to\r\nthe exterior\" (p. 14, 1875). The paired fins and limbs of the Vertebrate\r\narose by the functional transformation of two pairs of these gills. The\r\nanterior gills became the definitive internal gills of the Vertebrate,\r\nfor they gradually shifted into the mouths of the anterior segmental\r\norgans, which had already acquired an opening into the pharynx and had\r\nbeen transformed into true gill-slits. The posterior gills degenerated\r\nand disappeared, but their arches remained as ribs. Gill-arches and ribs\r\nwere accordingly homologous structures and formed a _parietal_ skeleton.\r\nThe vertebrate anus, like the mouth, was probably secondary and formed\r\nfrom a pair of gill-slits, the post-anal gut of vertebrate embryos\r\nhinting that the original anus was terminal as in Annelids. The unpaired\r\nfins of fish were originally paired and possibly arose from the\r\ncoalescence of rows of parapodia. Dohrn assumed also that the primitive\r\nAnnelid ancestor must have possessed a notochord to give support in\r\nswimming.\r\n\r\nIf Vertebrates arose from primitive Annelid ancestors, how account for\r\nAmphioxus and the Ascidians, which seem to be the most primitive living\r\nVertebrates and yet show no particular annelidan affinities? Dohrn tries\r\nto answer this awkward question by showing that these forms are not\r\nprimitive but degenerate. He points out first that Cyclostomes are\r\ndegenerate fish, half specialised and half degraded in adaptation to a\r\nparasitic mode of life. He thinks that if an _Ammocoetes_ were to become\r\nsexually mature and degenerate still further, forms would result which\r\nwould resemble Amphioxus, and ultimately, if the process of degeneration\r\nwent far enough, larval Ascidians. Amphioxus therefore might well be\r\nconsidered an extremely simplified and degenerate Cyclostome, and the\r\nascidian larva the last term of this degeneration-series. Both Amphioxus\r\nand the Ascidians would accordingly be descended from fish, instead of\r\nfish being evolved from them.\r\n\r\nDohrn conceived that the transformation of the Annelid into the\r\nVertebrate took place mainly by reason of an important transforming\r\nprinciple, which he calls the principle of function-change. Each organ,\r\nDohrn thinks, has besides its principal function a number of subsidiary\r\nfunctions which only await an opportunity to become active. \"The\r\ntransformation of an organ takes place by reason of the succession of\r\nthe functions which one and the same organ possesses. Each function is a\r\nresultant of several components, of which one is the principal or\r\nprimary function, while the others are the subsidiary or secondary\r\nfunctions. The weakening of the principal function and the strengthening\r\nof a subsidiary function alters the total function; the subsidiary\r\nfunction gradually becomes the chief function, the total function\r\nbecomes quite different, and the consequence of the whole process is the\r\ntransformation of the organ\" (p. 60). Examples of function-change are\r\nnot difficult to find. Thus the stomach in most Vertebrates performs\r\nboth a chemical and a mechanical function, but in some forms a part of\r\nit specialises in the mechanical side of the work and becomes a gizzard,\r\nwhile the remaining part confines its energies to the secretion of the\r\ngastric juice. So, too, it is through function-change that certain of\r\nthe ambulatory appendages of Arthropods have become transformed into\r\njaws--their function as graspers of food has gradually prevailed over\r\ntheir main function as walking limbs. In the evolution of Vertebrates\r\nfrom Annelids the principle came into action in many connections--in the\r\nformation of a new mouth from gill-slits, in the transformation of gills\r\ninto fins and limbs, of segmental organs into gill-slits, and so on.\r\nDohrn tells us that the principle of function-change was suggested to\r\nhim by Mivart's _Genesis of Species_ (1870), and he points out how it\r\nenables a partial reply to be made to the dangerous objection raised\r\nagainst the theory of natural selection that the first beginnings of new\r\norgans are necessarily useless in the struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nWe may note in passing that a somewhat similar idea was later applied by\r\nKleinenberg to the explanation of some of the ancestral features of\r\ndevelopment. He pointed out in his classical memoir on the embryology of\r\nthe Annelid _Lopadorhynchus_[400] that many embryonic organs seem to be\r\nformed for the sole purpose of providing the necessary stimulus for the\r\ndevelopment of the definitive organs. Thus the notochord is the\r\nnecessary forerunner of the vertebral column, cartilage the precursor of\r\nbone. \"From this point of view,\" he writes, \"many rudimentary organs\r\nappear in a different light. Their obstinate reappearance throughout\r\nlong phylogenetic series would be hard to understand were they really no\r\nmore than reminiscences of bygone and forgotten stages. Their\r\nsignificance in the processes of individual development may in truth be\r\nfar greater than is generally recognised. When in the course of the\r\nphylogeny they have played their part as intermediary organs\r\n(_Vermittelungsorgane_) they assume the same function in the ontogeny.\r\nThrough the stimulus or by the aid of these organs, now become\r\nrudimentary, the permanent parts of the embryo appear and are guided in\r\ntheir development; when these have attained a certain degree of\r\nindependence, the intermediary organ, having played its part, may be\r\nplaced upon the retired list.\"[401]\r\n\r\nDohrn was well aware of the functional, or as he calls it, the\r\nphysiological, orientation of his principle, and he rightly regarded\r\nthis as one of its chief merits. He held that morphology became too\r\nabstract and one-sided if it disregarded physiology completely; he saw\r\nclearly that the evolution of function was quite as important a problem\r\nas the evolution of form, and that neither could be solved in isolation\r\nfrom the other. \"The concept of function-change is purely\r\nphysiological;\" he writes, \"it contains the elements out of which\r\nperhaps a history of the evolution of function may gradually arise, and\r\nfor this very reason it will be of great utility in morphology, for the\r\nevolutionary history of structure is only the concrete projection of the\r\ncontent and course of the evolution of function, and cannot be\r\ncomprehended apart from it\" (p. 70).[402]\r\n\r\nIt is very instructive in this connection to note that Dohrn was not,\r\nlike so many of his contemporaries, a dogmatic materialist, but upheld\r\nthe commonsense view that vital phenomena must, in the first instance at\r\nleast, be accepted as they are. \"It is for the time being irrelevant,\"\r\nhe writes, \"to squabble over the question as to whether life is a result\r\nof physico-chemical processes or an original property (_Urqualitaet_) of\r\nall being.... Let us take it as given\" (p. 75).\r\n\r\nSemper's speculations on the genetic affinity of Articulates and\r\nVertebrates are contained in two papers[403] which appeared about the same\r\ntime as Dohrn's. He openly acknowledges that his work is essentially a\r\ncontinuation of Geoffroy's transcendental speculations, and gives in his\r\nsecond paper a good historical account of the views of his great\r\npredecessor. It is a significant fact that evolutionary morphologists\r\nvery generally held that Geoffroy was right in maintaining against\r\nCuvier[404] the unity of plan of the whole animal kingdom, for they saw in\r\nthis a strong argument for the monophyletic descent of all animals from\r\none common ancestral form.\r\n\r\nIn his first paper Semper does little more than break ground; he insists\r\non the fact that both Annelids and Vertebrates are segmented animals,\r\nand he points out how close is the analogy between the nephridia or\r\n\"segmental organs\" of the former and the excretory (mesonephric) tubules\r\nof the latter, upon which he published in the same volume an extensive\r\nmemoir. At this time he considered _Balanoglossus_--by reason of its\r\ngill-slits (its notochord he did not know)--to be the nearest living\r\nrepresentative of the ancestral form of Vertebrates and Annelida.\r\n\r\nHis second paper is a more exhaustive piece of work and deals with every\r\naspect of the problem, both from an anatomical and from an embryological\r\nstandpoint. It is consciously and admittedly an attempt to apply\r\nGeoffroy's principle of the unity of plan and composition to the three\r\ngreat metameric groups, the Annelida, Arthropoda, and Vertebrata. Semper\r\nfollows Geoffroy's lead very closely in maintaining that it is not the\r\nposition of the organs relative to the ground that must be taken into\r\naccount in establishing their homologies, but solely their spatial\r\nrelations one to another. He holds that dorsum and venter are terms of\r\npurely physiological import, and he proposes to substitute for them the\r\nterms neural and cardial (better, haemal) surfaces, either of which may\r\nbe either dorsal or ventral in position.\r\n\r\nHaving established this primary principle, Semper has little difficulty\r\nin showing that the main organs of the body lie to one another in the\r\nsame relative positions in Annelida, Arthropoda, and Vertebrata; and\r\nthis, together with the metameric segmentation common to them all,\r\nconstitutes his first great argument in favour of their genetic\r\nrelationship. But he has still to show that Annelids possess at least\r\nthe rudiments of certain organs which seem to be peculiar to\r\nVertebrates, as the gill-slits, the notochord, and a nervous system\r\ndeveloped from the ectoderm of the \"dorsal\" surface. He takes particular\r\ncognisance also of the old distinction drawn by von Baer, that\r\nVertebrates show a \"double-symmetrical\" mode of development (_evolutio\r\nbigemina_), the dorsal muscle-plates forming a tube above the notochord,\r\nthe ventral plates a tube below the notochord, whereas Articulates do\r\nnot possess this axis, and form only one tube, namely, that round the\r\n\"vegetative\" organs (_evolutio gemina_). Semper is at pains to prove\r\nthat _evolutio bigemina_ is characteristic also of Annelidan\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Transverse Section (Inverted) of the Worm\r\n_Nais_. (After Semper.)]\r\n\r\nHe gets his facts from an elaborate study of the process of budding in\r\nthe _Naidae_, making the somewhat risky assumption that regeneration\r\ntakes essentially the same course as embryonic development.\r\n\r\nHe succeeds in showing--to his own satisfaction at least--that in the\r\nformation of new segments in _Nais_ and _Chaetogaster_ a strand of cells\r\nappears between the alimentary canal and the nerve-cord, and that from\r\nthis axial strand the haemal muscle-plates grow out dorsally round the\r\nalimentary canal and the neural muscle-plates ventrally round the\r\nnerve-cord (see Fig. 14).\r\n\r\nThis strand of cells, he concludes, must clearly be the notochord, and\r\nthe type of development is obviously the double-symmetrical met with in\r\nVertebrates.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system Semper found to develop in the buds of _Nais_ and\r\n_Chaetogaster_ by an ectodermal thickening, just as in some Vertebrates.\r\nThe cerebral ganglion was formed by the ends of the nerve-cord growing\r\nup round the oesophagus and fusing with the paired \"sense-plates\" which\r\ndevelop from the ectoderm of the head. The cerebral ganglion is\r\naccordingly only secondarily haemal in position, and there is no need\r\ntherefore to seek in Vertebrates for the homologue of the oesophageal\r\ncommissures of Annelids, as, for instance, Schneider did.\r\n\r\nSince the mouth opens on the neural surface in Annelids and on the haemal\r\nsurface in Vertebrates, Semper considers that they cannot be equivalent\r\nstructures, and he finds the homologue of the Vertebrate mouth in a\r\nlittle pit on the haemal surface of the head in the leech _Clepsine_ (also\r\nin the true mouth of Turbellaria and the proboscis-opening in\r\nNemertines). The primitive Annelid mouth, however, does not appear in\r\nthe embryogeny of Vertebrates, for the great development of the brain\r\ncrowds it out of existence.\r\n\r\nThe homologues of the gill-slits Semper finds in two little canals in\r\nthe head of _Chaetogaster_, which open from the pharynx to the exterior.\r\nIn Sabellids he describes an elaborate system of gill-canals, with a\r\nsupporting cartilaginous framework which forms a real _Kiemenkorb_ or\r\ngill-basket, comparable with that of Amphioxus.\r\n\r\nGill-slits, notochord, relation of nervous system, mesonephric tubules,\r\nare thus common to Annelids and Vertebrates--what further proof could\r\none desire of the close relationship of these groups? Yet Semper enters\r\ninto refinements of comparison, seeing, for instance, in the lateral\r\nportions of the ventral ganglia (Fig. 14, _sp. g._) the homologues of\r\nthe spinal ganglia of Vertebrates, and comparing the lateral line of\r\nsense organs in Annelids with the lateral line in Anamnia.\r\n\r\nHe will not admit that Amphioxus and the Ascidians show a closer\r\nresemblance to Vertebrates than his beloved Annelids. Amphioxus, he\r\nthinks, is not a Vertebrate, and Ascidians, though sharing with Annelids\r\nthe possession of a notochord, gill-slits, and a \"dorsal\" nervous\r\nsystem, yet are further removed from Vertebrates than the latter by\r\nreason of their lacking that essential characteristic of Vertebrates,\r\nmetameric segmentation.\r\n\r\nNot content with establishing the unity of plan of Annelids, Arthropods,\r\nand Vertebrates, Semper tries to link on the Annelids, as the most\r\nprimitive group of the three, to the unsegmented worms, and particularly\r\nto the Turbellaria. His speculations on this matter may be summed up\r\nsomewhat as follows:--The common ancestor of all segmented animals is a\r\nsegmented worm-like form, not quite like any existing type, resembling\r\nthe Turbellaria in having two nerve strands on the dorsal side and no\r\noesophageal ring, potentially able to develop either the Vertebrate or\r\nthe Annelid mouth, and so to give origin both to the Articulate and to\r\nthe Vertebrate series. The common ancestor alike of unsegmented worms\r\nand of all segmented types is probably the trochosphere larva, which in\r\nthe Vertebrates is represented by the simple _Keimblase_ or blastula.\r\n\r\nThe Annelid theory of Dohrn and Semper was perhaps not so widely\r\naccepted as the rival Ascidian theory, but it counted not a few\r\nadherents and gave a certain stimulus to comparative morphology. F. M.\r\nBalfour, who pointed out about the same time as Semper the analogy\r\nbetween the nephridia of Annelids and the mesonephric tubules of\r\nVertebrates,[405] while not accepting the actual theories of Dohrn and\r\nSemper, took up a distinctly favourable attitude to the general idea\r\nthat Annelids and Vertebrates were descended from a common segmented\r\nancestor. Discussing this question in his classical work on the\r\ndevelopment of Elasmobranch fishes,[406] Balfour came to the conclusion\r\n\"that we must look for the ancestors of the Chordata, not in allies of\r\nthe present Chaetopoda, but in a stock of segmented forms descended from\r\nthe same unsegmented types as the Chaetopoda, but in which two lateral\r\nnerve-cords, like those of Nemertines, coalesced dorsally instead of\r\nventrally to form a median nervous cord. This group of forms, if my\r\nsuggestion as to their existence is well founded, appears now to have\r\nperished.\"[407]\r\n\r\nHe held that while there was much to be said for the interchange of\r\ndorsal and ventral surfaces postulated by Dohrn and Semper, the\r\ndifficulties involved in the supposition were too great; he preferred,\r\ntherefore, to assume that the present Vertebrate mouth was primitive,\r\nand not a secondary formation.\r\n\r\nHis views as to the phylogeny of the Chordata and the genetic relation\r\nof the various classes to one another are exhibited in the following\r\nschema,[408] names of hypothetical groups being printed in capitals, names\r\nof degenerate groups in italics:--\r\n\r\n\r\n Mammalia.

Protochordata.          _Urochorda_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical ancestral forms (Protochordata) possessed a notochord,\r\na ventral suctorial mouth and numerous gill-slits, and were presumably\r\ndescended from the common ancestor of Annelids and Vertebrates.\r\nAmphioxus and the Ascidians found their place in this schema as\r\ndegenerate offshoots of the ancestral Protochordates, while the\r\nCyclostomes were in the same way the degenerate modern representatives\r\nof the ancestral Protovertebrates.\r\n\r\nBalfour's suggestion, that the nervous system in Annelids and\r\nVertebrates might have arisen by the dorsal or ventral coalescence of\r\nthe lateral nerve cords found in their common ancestor, bore fruit in\r\nthe speculations of Hubrecht,[409] on the relation of Nemertines to\r\nVertebrates.\r\n\r\nThe Annelid theory was firmly supported by Eisig, who in his elaborate\r\nmonograph on the _Capitellidae_[410] maintained against Fuerbringer the\r\ngenetic identity of the Annelidan nephridia with the kidney tubules of\r\nVertebrates. The independent discovery by E. Meyer[411] and J. T.\r\nCunningham,[412] of an internal segmental duct in _Lanice_, into which\r\nseveral nephridia opened, seemed to strengthen this view.\r\n\r\nFollowing Ehlers,[413] Eisig found the homologue of the notochord in the\r\naccessory intestine of the _Capitellidae_ and _Eunicidae_, which he\r\nsupposed might easily be transformed, according to the principle of\r\nfunction-change, from a respiratory to a supporting organ. He finally\r\ndisposed of the alternative notion that the notochord was represented in\r\nAnnelids by the \"giant-fibres\" or neurochordal strands which lie close\r\nabove the nerve-cord, a view held by Kowalevsky,[414] and for a time by\r\nSemper. These strands were shown by Eisig, and by Spengel, to be the\r\nneurilemmar sheaths of thick nerve fibres which had in many cases\r\ndegenerated. The view that the content of the neurochordal tubes was\r\nnervous in nature was first promulgated by Leydig in 1864.\r\n\r\nMuch difference of opinion reigned as to the true homologies of the\r\nbrain and mouth of Annelids and Vertebrates. Beard[415] and others got\r\nover the difficulty of the haemal position of the cerebral ganglion in\r\nAnnelids by supposing that it degenerated and disappeared altogether in\r\nthe Annelidan ancestor of Vertebrates, and that accordingly it had no\r\nhomologue in the Vertebrate nervous system. Beard put forward also the\r\ningenious theory that the hypophysis represents the old Annelidan mouth.\r\n\r\nVan Beneden and Julin[416] assumed that in the ancestors of Vertebrates\r\nthe oesophagus shifted forward between the still unconnected lobes of\r\nthe brain to open on the haemal surface.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental assumption of the Annelid theory, that dorsal and\r\nventral surfaces are morphologically interchangeable, seemed rather bold\r\nto many zoologists, and Gegenbaur[417] voiced a common opinion when he\r\nrejected as unscientific the comparison of the ventral nerve cord of\r\nArticulates with the dorsal nervous system of Vertebrates.\r\n\r\nThe _Balanoglossus_ theory of Vertebrate descent also belongs, at least\r\nin its first form, to the earlier group of evolutionary speculations.\r\nThe gill-slits of _Balanoglossus_ were discovered by Kowalevsky as early\r\nas 1866.[418] _Tornaria_ was discovered by J. Mueller in 1850, but by him\r\nconsidered an Asterid larva; its true nature as the larva of\r\n_Balanoglossus_ was made out by Metschnikoff in 1870, who also remarked\r\nupon its extraordinary likeness to the larvae of Echinoderms.[419] That it\r\nhad some relationship with Vertebrates was recognised by Semper,\r\nGegenbaur and others, but the full working-out of its Vertebrate\r\naffinities is due to Bateson.[420]\r\n\r\nBateson broke completely with the Dohrn-Semper view that the metamerism\r\nof Articulates and Vertebrates must be put down to inheritance from a\r\ncommon ancestor. He held that metamerism was merely a special\r\nmanifestation of the general property of repetition, common to all\r\nliving things (_cf._ Owen's \"vegetative force\"), and that accordingly\r\n\"however far back a segmented ancestor of a segmented descendant may\r\npossibly be found, yet ultimately the form has still to be sought for in\r\nwhich these repetitions had their origin\" (p. 549). The meaning of the\r\nphenomenon was obscure, but he was convinced that the explanation was\r\nnot to be found in ancestry. \"This much alone is clear,\" he wrote, \"that\r\nthe meaning of cases of complex repetition will not be found in the\r\nsearch for an ancestral form, which, itself presenting this same\r\ncharacter, may be twisted into a representation of its supposed\r\ndescendant. Such forms there may be, but in finding them the real\r\nproblem is not even resolved a single stage; for from whence was their\r\nrepetition derived? The answer to this question can only come in a\r\nfuller understanding of the laws of growth and of variation, which are\r\nas yet merely terms\" (pp. 548-9). It was in following up this line of\r\nthought that Bateson produced his monumental _Materials for the Study of\r\nVariation_ (1894).\r\n\r\nHe found a strong positive argument for his theory that Vertebrates are\r\ndescended from unsegmented forms in the fact that the notochord arises\r\nas an unsegmented structure. With the notochord he homologised the\r\nsupporting rod in the proboscis of _Balanoglossus_, which like the\r\nnotochord arises from the dorsal wall of the archenteron, and has a\r\nvacuolated structure. The gill-slits of _Balanoglossus_, with their\r\nclose resemblance in detail to those of Amphioxus, Bateson also used as\r\nan argument in favour of the phylogenetic relationship of the\r\nEnteropneusta and Vertebrata, together with the formation from the\r\nectoderm of a dorsal nerve tube.\r\n\r\nBateson's views attracted considerable attention, and were thought by\r\nmany to lighten appreciably the obscurity in which the origin of\r\nVertebrates was wrapped. Thus Lankester wrote in his article on\r\nVertebrates[421] in the _Encyclopedia Britannica_:--\"It seems that in\r\n_Balanoglossus_ we at last find a form which, though no doubt\r\nspecialised for its burrowing sand-life, and possibly to some extent\r\ndegenerate, yet has not to any large extent fallen from an ancestral\r\neminence. The ciliated epidermis, the long worm-like form, and the\r\ncomplete absence of segmentation of the body-muscles lead us to forms\r\nlike the Nemertines. The great proboscis of _Balanoglossus_ may well be\r\ncompared to the invaginable organ similarly placed in the Nemertines.\r\nThe collar is the first commencement of a structure destined to assume\r\ngreat importance in _Cephalochorda_ and _Craniata_, and perhaps\r\nprotective of a single gill-slit in _Balanoglossus_ before the number of\r\nthose apertures had been extended. Borrowing, as we may, the nephridia\r\nfrom the Nemertines, and the lateral in addition to the dorsal nerve, we\r\nfind that _Balanoglossus_ gives the most hopeful hypothetical solution\r\nof the pedigree of Vertebrates.\"\r\n\r\nMuch doubt was cast upon the Chordate affinities of the Enteropneusta by\r\nSpengel in his monograph of the group,[422] but when the development of\r\nthe coelom came to be more thoroughly worked out in _Balanoglossus_ and\r\nAmphioxus, the striking resemblance in this respect between the two\r\nforms gave additional support to the Batesonian view.[423]\r\n\r\n    [386] The stages in the development of microscopical\r\n    technique are well summarised by R.

This developmental archetype was manifested in, for instance,\r\n_Sagitta_,[424] _Rana_,[425] _Lymnaea_,[426] _Astacus_,[427]\r\n_Phoronis_,[428] _Asterias_,[429] _Ascidia_,[428] the _Ctenophora_,[428]\r\nand _Amphioxus_.[428] He noticed also that the invagination-opening\r\noften became the definitive anus. Further instances of this mode of\r\ndevelopment were later observed by Metschnikoff[430] and by\r\nKowalevsky[431] himself, but it was left to Haeckel to generalise these\r\nobservations and build up from them his famous Gastraea theory. This was\r\nfirst enunciated in his monograph of the calcareous sponges,[432] and\r\nworked out in detail in a series of papers published in 1874-76.[433]\r\n\r\nHaeckel maintained that the \"gastrula\" stage occurred in the development\r\nof all Metazoa, and that it was typically formed, by invagination, from\r\na hollow sphere of cells or \"blastula.\" This typical formation might be\r\nmasked by cenogenetic modifications caused chiefly by the presence of\r\nyolk. The gastrula stage was the palingenetic repetition of the\r\nancestral form of all Metazoa, the Gastraea.\r\n\r\nFrom the Gastraea theory there followed at once two consequences, (1)\r\nthat ectoderm and endoderm, invagination-cavity (_Urdarm_) and\r\ngastrula-mouth (_Urmund_ or _Protostoma_), were, with all their\r\nderivatives, homologous, because homogenous, throughout the Metazoa, and\r\n(2) that the descent of the Metazoa had been monophyletic, since all\r\nwere derived from the ancestral Gastraea. Huxley's suggestion (_supra_,\r\np. 208) that the outer and inner layers in Coelentera were homologous\r\nwith the ectoderm and endoderm of the germ was thus fully confirmed and\r\ngreatly extended.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of the Gastraea theory lay in the fact that it\r\nlinked up, by means of the biogenetic law, the germ-layer theory with\r\nthe doctrine of evolution. It supplied an evolutionary interpretation of\r\nthe earliest and most important of embryogenetic events, the process of\r\nlayer-formation. Upon the Gastraea theory or its implications were\r\nfounded most of the phylogenetic speculations which subsequently\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nUpon the Gastraea theory Haeckel based a system of phylogenetic\r\nclassification which was intended to replace Cuvier's and von Baer's\r\ndoctrine of Types. This took the form of a monophyletic ancestral tree.\r\nIts main outlines are given on p. 290 in graphic form, combined and\r\nmodified from the table on p. 53 of the 1874 paper and the genealogical\r\ntree given in the _Kalkschwaemme_.[434]\r\n\r\n_Monophyletic Genealogical Tree of the Animal Kingdom, based upon the\r\nGastraea Theory and the Homology of the Germ Layers_.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________\r\n|      |                                                       |    . |\r\n|      |                                                       |    m |\r\n|      |                               _Vertebrata_.           |    o |\r\n|    . |                                    |                  |    l |\r\n|    m |               _Arthropoda_.        |                  |    e |\r\n|    r |                     |              |                  |    o |\r\n|    e |                     |              |                  |    c |\r\n|    d |_Echinoderma_.       |              |  _Mollusca_.     |      |\r\n|    d |      |              |              |       |          |    a |\r\n|    n |      |              |   Sagitta.   \\______ | ______/  |  |   |\r\n|    e |      |              |      |              \\|/         | .  d |\r\n|      |      |              |      |               |          | a  n |\r\n|    y |      |              |      | Nematoda.

The\r\ngreat contrast between the Protozoa, or animals with neither gut nor\r\ngerm-layers, and the Metazoa, which possess both structures, is for the\r\nfirst time clearly brought out. The derivation of all the Metazoa from a\r\nsingle ancestral form, the Gastraea, leads to the conclusion that the\r\ntypes are not distinct from one another as Cuvier and von Baer supposed,\r\nbut agree in the one essential point, in the possession of an\r\n_archenteron_ (Lankester, 1875), and an ectoderm and endoderm which are\r\nhomologous throughout all the Metazoan phyla. Finally, in the separation\r\nof the sponges, Coelenterata and Acoelomi as animals lacking a body\r\ncavity or coelom[435] from the four higher phyla, which are essentially\r\nCoelomati, there is contained the germ of a conception which later\r\nbecame of importance.\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar views as to the importance of the germ-layer theory for\r\nthe phylogenetic classification of animals were published by Sir E. Ray\r\nLankester in 1873.[436] He distinguished three grades of animals--the\r\nHomoblastica, Diploblastica, and Triploblastica. The first included the\r\nProtozoa, the second the Coelenterata, the third the other five phyla,\r\ndistinguished by the possession of a third layer, the mesoderm, and a\r\n\"blood-lymph\" cavity enclosed therein. He used the germ-layer theory to\r\nprove the essential unity of type of all the Triploblastica.\r\n\r\nThe Gastraea theory gave point and substance to the biogenetic law, and\r\nenabled Haeckel to state much more concretely the parallelism existing\r\nbetween ontogeny and phylogeny. He was able to assert that five\r\nprimordial stages, each representing a primitive ancestral form,\r\nrecurred with regularity in the very earliest development of all\r\nMetazoa.[437] These were the monerula, cytula, morula, blastula, and\r\ngastrula (see Fig. 15). The monerula was the fertilised ovum after the\r\ndisappearance of the germinal vesicle;[438] it was the equivalent of\r\nthe primordial anucleate Monera which are the ancestors of all\r\nanimals. The ovum after the nucleus had been re-formed became the\r\ncytula, which was the ontogenetic counterpart of the amoeba. The\r\nmorula, a compact mulberry-like congeries of segmentation-cells,\r\ncorresponded to the synamoeba, or earliest association of\r\nundifferentiated amoeboid cells to form the first multicellular\r\norganism. The blastula, or hollow sphere of segmentation cells,\r\nusually ciliated, was reminiscent of the planaea, an ancestral\r\nfree-swimming form whose nearest living relation is the spherical\r\n_Magosphaera_. The gastrula, finally, is the two-layered sac formed\r\nfrom the blastula, typically by invagination of its wall. It repeats\r\nthe organisation of the gastraea, which is the common ancestor of all\r\nMetazoa, and finds its nearest living counterpart in the simple\r\n\"sponges\" _Haliphysema_ and _Gastrophysema_.[439] The ancestral line\r\nof all the higher animals begins with the five hypothetical forms of\r\nthe moneron, amoeba, synamoeba, planaea, and gastraea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--The Five Primary Stages of Ontogeny. (After\r\nHaeckel.) 1. Monerula. 2. Cytula. 3. Morula. 4. Blastula. 5. Gastrula.]\r\n\r\nWe may take the following account[440] of the phylogeny of the human\r\nspecies, from the gastraea stage onwards, as typical of Haeckel's\r\nspeculations on the evolution of the higher forms. The progenitors of\r\nman are, after the Gastraeada:--\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Turbellaria.\r\n*2. Scolecida. (Worms with a coelom, probably represented\r\n        at the present day by _Balanoglossus_.)\r\n*3. Himatega. (Evolved from Scolecida by formation of\r\n        dorsal nerve-tube and chorda, and resembling tailed\r\n        larvae of Ascidians.)\r\n4. Acrania. (With metameric segmentation. Including\r\n        Amphioxus.)\r\n5. Monorrhina. (Cyclostomes.)\r\n6. Selachia.\r\n7. Dipneusta.\r\n8. Sozobranchia. (Amphibia with permanent gills.)\r\n9. Sozura. (Tailed Amphibia.)\r\n*10. Protamnia.\r\n*11. Promammalia.\r\n12. Marsupialia.\r\n13. Prosimiae.\r\n14. Menocerca. (Tailed apes.)\r\n15. Anthropoides.\r\n16. Pithecanthropi.\r\n17. Homines.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that except for the hypothetical forms (marked with\r\nan asterisk), which are themselves generalised classificatory groups,\r\nthe ancestral forms belong to long-recognised classes. The whole course\r\nof the evolution follows well-worn systematic lines. This is typical of\r\nHaeckel's phylogenetic speculations.\r\n\r\nA more abstractly morphological scheme of the evolution of Vertebrates\r\nis given in the _Systematic Phylogeny_ of 1895.[441] The ontogenetic and\r\nancestral stages are arranged in parallel columns thus:--\r\n\r\nCytula.                            Cytaea (Protozoa).\r\nMorula.                            Moraea (Coenobium of Protozoa).\r\nBlastula.                          Blastaea (_Volvocina_, etc.).\r\nDepula (invaginated blastula).     Depaea.\r\nGastrula.                          Gastraea (cf. _Olynthus_, _Hydra_, and\r\n                                      primitive Coelentera).\r\nCoelomula (with one pair           Coelomaea (cf. _Sagitta_, _Ascidia_,\r\n  of coelom-pockets).                 and primitive Helminthes).\r\nChordula (with medullary           Chordaea (_cf._ Ascidian larva and\r\n  tube and chorda).                   larva of Amphioxus).\r\nSpondula (with segmented           Prospondylus (Primitive Vertebrate).\r\n  mesoderm).\r\n\r\nThis scheme differs from the earlier one chiefly in taking into account\r\ncertain advances, notably as regards the cytology of the fertilised ovum\r\nand the true nature of the coelom, which had been made in the interval\r\nof some twenty years.\r\n\r\nHaeckel's Gastraea theory, though it exercised a great influence upon the\r\nsubsequent trend of phylogenetic speculation, was by no means\r\nuniversally accepted _telle quelle_. Opinions differed considerably as\r\nto the primitive mode of origin of the two-layered sac which was very\r\ngenerally admitted to be of constant occurrence in early embryogeny. Ray\r\nLankester, in his paper of 1873, and more fully in 1877,[442] propounded a\r\n\"Planula\" theory, according to which the ancestral form of the Metazoa\r\nwas a two-layered closed sac formed typically by delamination, less\r\noften by invagination. He denied that the invagination opening (which he\r\nnamed the blastopore) represented the primitive mouth,[443] holding that\r\nthis was typically formed by an \"inruptive\" process at the anterior end\r\nof the planula, which led to the formation of a \"stomodaeum.\" A similar\r\nprocess at the posterior end gave rise to the anus and the \"proctodaeum.\"\r\n\r\nThe question as to whether delamination or invagination was to be\r\nconsidered the more primitive process was discussed in detail by\r\nBalfour,[444] without, however, any very definite conclusion being\r\nreached. He held that both processes could be proved in certain cases to\r\nbe purely secondary or adaptive, and that accordingly there was nothing\r\nto show that either of them reproduced the original mode of transition\r\nfrom the Protozoa to the ancestral two-layered Metazoa (p. 342). He by\r\nno means rejected the theory that the Gastraea, \"however evolved, was a\r\nprimitive form of the Metazoa,\" but, having regard to the great\r\nvariations shown in the relation of the blastopore to mouth and anus\r\n(pp. 340-1), he was inclined to think that if the gastrula had any\r\nancestral characters at all, these could only be of the most general\r\nkind. Balfour's attitude perhaps best represents the general consensus\r\nof opinion with regard to the Gastraea theory.\r\n\r\nFrom the same origins as the Gastraea theory arose the theory of the\r\ncoelom. The term dates back to Haeckel in 1872, and the observations\r\nwhich first led up to the theory were made by the men who supplied the\r\nfoundations of the Gastraea theory--A. Agassiz, Metschnikoff and\r\nKowalevsky. But it was not Haeckel himself who enunciated the coelom\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Remak introduced in 1855 the conception of\r\nthe mesoderm as an independent layer derived from the endoderm. The\r\npleuro-peritoneal or body-cavity was formed as a split in the \"ventral\r\nplates\" of the mesoderm. Haeckel's \"coelom\" corresponded to the\r\n\"pleuro-peritoneal cavity\" of Remak, but his view of the origin of the\r\nmesoderm brought him much closer to von Baer's conception of the origin\r\nof _two_ secondary layers from ectoderm and endoderm respectively than\r\nto Remak's conception of the mesoderm as a single independent layer.\r\n\r\nMuch uncertainty reigned at the time as to the exact manner of origin of\r\nthe mesoderm;[445] some held that it developed from the ectoderm, others\r\nthat it originated in the endoderm, while still others, and among them\r\nHaeckel, considered that part of it came from the ectoderm and part from\r\nthe endoderm (pp. 23-4, 1874).\r\n\r\nThe solution of the problem came from those observations on the\r\ndevelopment of the lower forms to which we have just alluded.\r\n\r\nThe early history of these discoveries and of the theory which grew out\r\nof them has been well summarised by Lankester,[446] and may conveniently\r\nbe given in his own words:--\r\n\r\n\"As far back as 1864 Alexander Agassiz (\"Embryology of the Star-fish,\"\r\nin _Contributions to the Natural History of the United States_, vol. v.,\r\n1864) showed in his account of the development of Echinoderma that the\r\ngreat body-cavity of those animals developed as a pouch-like outgrowth\r\nof the archenteron of the embryo, whilst a second outgrowth gave rise to\r\ntheir ambulacral system; and in 1869 Metschnikoff (_Mem. de l'Acad.\r\nimperiale des Sciences de St Petersbourg_, series vii., vol. xiv.,\r\n1869), confirmed the observations of Agassiz, and showed that in\r\nTornaria (the larva of Balanoglossus) a similar formation of\r\nbody-cavities by pouch-like outgrowths of the archenteron took place.\r\nMetschnikoff has further the credit of having, in 1874 (_Zeitsch. wiss.\r\nZoologie_, vol. xxiv., p. 15, 1874), revived Leuckart's theory of the\r\nrelationship of the coelenteric apparatus of the Enterocoela to the\r\ndigestive canal and body-cavities of the higher animals. Leuckart had in\r\n1848 maintained that the alimentary canal and the body-cavity of higher\r\nanimals were united in one system of cavities in the Enterocoela\r\n(_Verwandschaftsverhaeltnisse der wirbellosen Thiere_, Brunswick, 1848).\r\nMetschnikoff insisted upon such a correspondence when comparing the\r\nEchinoderm larva, with its still continuous enteron and coelom, to a\r\nCtenophor, with its permanently continuous system of cavities and\r\ncanals. Kowalevsky, in 1871, showed that the body-cavity of Sagitta was\r\nformed by a division of the archenteron into three parallel cavities,\r\nand in 1874 demonstrated the same fact for the Brachiopoda. In 1875\r\n(_Quart. Journ. Micr. Sci._, vol. xv., p. 52) Huxley proposed to\r\ndistinguish three kinds of body-cavity: the schizocoel, formed by the\r\nsplitting of the mesoblast, as in the chick's blastoderm; the\r\nenterocoel, formed by pouching of the archenteron, as in Echinoderms,\r\nSagitta and Brachiopoda; and the epicoel.... Immediately after this I\r\nput forward the theory of the uniformity of origin of the coelom as an\r\nenterocoel (_Quart. Journ. Micr. Sci._, April, 1875).... My theory of\r\nthe coelom as an enterocoel was accepted by Balfour and was greatly\r\nstrengthened by his observations on the derivation of both notochord and\r\nmesoblastic somites from archenteron in the Elasmobranchs, and by the\r\npublication in 1877 by Kowalevsky of his second paper on the development\r\nof Amphioxus--in which the actual condition which I had supposed to\r\nexist in the Vertebrata was shown to occur, namely, the formation of the\r\nmesoblast as paired pouches in which a narrow lumen exists, but is\r\npractically obliterated on the nipping-off of the pouch from the\r\narchenteron, after which process it opens out again as coelom\" (pp.\r\n16-18).\r\n\r\nThe enterocoelic theory was taken up by O. and R. Hertwig as an\r\nessential part of their _Coelomtheorie_.[447] In a lengthy series of\r\nmonographs these workers made a comparative study of the mode of\r\nformation of the middle layer, and arrived at a coherent theory of its\r\norigin. They distinguished in the middle layer two quite distinct\r\nelements, the mesoblast proper, formed by the evagination of the walls\r\nof the archenteron, and the mesenchyme, formed by free cells budded off\r\nfrom the germ-layers. The following passage gives a good idea of their\r\nviews and of the phylogenetic implications involved:--\"Ectoblast and\r\nentoblast are the two primary germ-layers which arise from the\r\ninvagination of the blastula; they are always the first to be laid down,\r\nand they can be directly referred back to a simple ancestral form, the\r\nGastraea; they form the limits of the organism towards the exterior and\r\ntowards the archenteron. The parietal and visceral mesoblast, or the two\r\nmiddle layers, are always of later origin, and arise through evagination\r\nor plaiting of the entoblast, the remainder of which can now be\r\ndistinguished as secondary entoblast from the primary. They form the\r\nwalls of a new cavity, the enterocoel, which is to be regarded as a\r\nnipped-off diverticulum of the archenteron. Just as the two-layered\r\nanimals can be derived from the Gastraea, so can the four-layered animals\r\nbe derived from a Coelom form. Embryonic cells, which become singly\r\ndetached from their epitheliar connections we consider to be something\r\nquite different from the germ-layers, and accordingly we call them by\r\nthe special name of mesenchyme germs or primary cells of the mesenchyme.\r\nThey may develop both in two-layered and in four-layered animals. Their\r\nfunction is to form between the epithelial limiting layers a secreted\r\ntissue (_Secretgewebe_) or connective tissue with scattered cells, which\r\ncells can undergo, like the epithelial elements, the most varied\r\nmodifications.... This secreted tissue in its simple or in its\r\ndifferentiated state, with all its derivatives, we call the mesenchyme\"\r\n(p. 122).\r\n\r\nThe important point for us is that, just as all Metazoa were considered\r\nby Haeckel to be descended from the Gastraea, so all Coelomati were held\r\nby the Hertwigs to be derived from an original coelomate _Urform_. In\r\nboth cases an embryological archetype becomes a hypothetical ancestral\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe Coelom theory was considerably modified, extended and developed by\r\nlater workers, particularly as regards the relations to the coelom of\r\nthe genital organs and ducts and the nephridia, but no special\r\nmethodological interest attaches to these further developments.[448] We\r\nshall here focus attention upon one interesting line of speculation\r\nfollowed out in this country particularly by Sedgwick--the theory of the\r\nActinozoan ancestry of segmented animals. Its relation to the Coelom\r\ntheory lies in the fact that Sedgwick regarded the segmentation of the\r\nbody as moulded upon the segmentation of the mesoblast, which in its\r\nturn, as Kowalevsky and Hatschek had shown, was a consequence of its\r\nmode of origin as a series of pouches of the archenteron. In other\r\nrespects Sedgwick's speculations link on more closely to the Gastraea\r\ntheory, for one of his main contentions is that the blastopore or\r\n_Urmund_ is homologous throughout at least the three metameric phyla. In\r\nfollowing up Balfour's observations on the development of\r\n_Peripatus_,[449] Sedgwick was struck with the close resemblance existing\r\nbetween the elongated slit-like blastopore of this form (giving rise to\r\nboth mouth and anus), with its border of nervous tissue, and the\r\nslit-like mouth of the Actinozoan (functioning both as mouth and anus),\r\nround which, as the Hertwigs had shown, there lies a special\r\nconcentration of nerve cells and nerve fibres. He found another point of\r\nresemblance in the gastric pouches of the Actinozoa, which he\r\nhomologised directly with the enterocoelic pouches of the Coelomati. He\r\nwas led to enunciate the following theses:--[450] (1) that the mouth and\r\nanus of Vermes, Mollusca, Arthopoda, and probably Vertebrata, is derived\r\nfrom the elongated mouth of an ancestor resembling the Actinozoa; (2)\r\nthat somites are derived from a series of archenteric pouches, like\r\nthose of Actinozoa and Medusae; (3) that excretory organs (nephridia,\r\nsegmental organs) are derived from parts of these pouches which in the\r\nancestral form, as in many polyps, were connected by a circular or\r\nlongitudinal canal, and opened to the exterior by pores. This\r\nlongitudinal canal was lost in Invertebrates, but persisted in\r\nVertebrates as the pronephric duct, while the pores remained in\r\nInvertebrates and disappeared in Vertebrates; (4) that the tracheae of\r\nArthropods, as well as the canal of the central nervous system in\r\nVertebrates, are to be traced back to certain ectodermal pits in the\r\ndiploblastic ancestor comparable to the sub-genital pits of the\r\nScyphomedusae. These ectodermal pits were all originally respiratory\r\norgans. \"The essence of all these propositions,\" he writes, \"lies in the\r\nfact that the segmented animals are traced back not to a triploblastic\r\nunsegmented ancestor, but to a two-layered Coelenterate-like animal with\r\na pouched gut, the pouching having arisen as a result of the necessity\r\nfor an increase in the extent of the vegetative surfaces in a rapidly\r\nenlarging animal (for circulation and respiration)\" (p. 47). \"I have\r\nattempted to show,\" he writes further on, \"that the majority of the\r\nTriploblastica ... are built upon a common plan, and that that plan is\r\nrevealed by a careful examination of the anatomy of Coelenterata; that\r\nall the most important organ-systems of these Triploblastica are found\r\nin a rudimentary condition in the Coelenterata; and that all the\r\nTriploblastica referred to must be traced back to a diploblastic\r\nancestor common to them and the Coelenterata\" (p. 68). The main\r\nassumption was that the neural or blastoporal surface must be homologous\r\nthroughout the Metazoa, though it was dorsal in the Chordata, ventral in\r\nthe Annelida and Arthropoda. He derived the central nervous system of\r\nthe Chordata from the circumoral ring of the common ancestor by means of\r\nthe hypothesis that both the pre-blastoporal and the post-blastoporal\r\nparts of it disappeared.[451]\r\n\r\nThe characteristic relation of the central nervous system to the\r\nblastopore in Annelida and Vertebrates had already been pointed out by\r\nKowalevsky,[452] who had also sketched a theory of the common descent of\r\nthese two phyla from an ancestral form in which the nervous system\r\nencircled the blastopore.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, before the publication of Sedgwick's papers, A. Lang[453] had put\r\nforward the somewhat similar view that the stomach-diverticula of the\r\nTurbellaria, which he had found to be segmentally arranged in certain\r\nTriclads, were the morphological equivalents of the enterocoelic pouches\r\nof higher animals. This view, however, he soon gave up.[454] Sedgwick's\r\nviews found a supporter in A. A. W. Hubrecht,[455] who utilised them in\r\nconnection both with his speculations on the relation of Nemertines to\r\nVertebrates, and with his exhaustive work on the early development of\r\nthe Mammalia. He postulated as the far-back ancestor of Vertebrates, \"an\r\nactinia-like, vermiform being, elongated in the direction of the\r\nmouth-slit\" (p. 410, 1906), and derived the central nervous system from\r\nthe circum-oral ring of this primitive form, the notochord from its\r\nstomodaeum, and the coelom from the peripheral parts of the gastric\r\ncavity (p. 169, 1909).\r\n\r\n    [424] Gegenbaur, _Zeits. f. wiss.

But since this is what modern morphological criticism in great\r\nmeasure aims at doing, it cannot be altogether profitless to follow this\r\nmethod to its logical conclusions. That the results of such criticism\r\nmust be highly speculative, and often liable to grave error, is\r\nevident.\"\r\n\r\nThe quotation is from Bateson's paper of 1886, and it is symptomatic of\r\nthe change which was soon to come over morphological thought. New\r\ninterests, new lines of work, began to usurp the place which pure\r\nmorphology had held so long.\r\n\r\nThis is accordingly a convenient stage at which to take stock of what\r\nhas gone before, to consider the relation of evolutionary morphology to\r\nthe transcendental and the Cuvierian schools of thought which preceded\r\nit, and to make clear what new element evolution-theory added to\r\nmorphology.\r\n\r\nThe close analogy between evolutionary and transcendental morphology has\r\nalready been remarked upon and illustrated in the last three chapters.\r\nWe have seen that the coming of evolution made comparatively little\r\ndifference to pure morphology, that no new criteria of homology were\r\nintroduced, and that so far as pure morphology was concerned, evolution\r\nmight still have been conceived as an ideal process precisely as it was\r\nby the transcendentalists. The principle of connections still remained\r\nthe guiding thread of morphological work; the search for archetypes,\r\nwhether anatomical or embryological, still continued in the same way as\r\nbefore, and it was a point of subordinate importance that, under the\r\ninfluence of the evolution-theory, these were considered to represent\r\nreal ancestral forms rather than purely abstract figments of the\r\nintelligence. The law of Meckel-Serres was revived in an altered shape\r\nas the law of the recapitulation of phylogeny by ontogeny; the natural\r\nsystem of classification was passively inherited, and, by a _petitio\r\nprincipii_, taken to represent the true course of evolution. It is true\r\nthat the attempt was made to substitute for the concept of homology the\r\npurely genetic concept of homogeny, but no inkling was given of any\r\npossible method of recognising homogeny other than the well-worn methods\r\ngenerally employed in the search after homologies.\r\n\r\nThere was a close spiritual affinity between the speculative\r\nevolutionists and the transcendentalists. Both showed the same\r\nsubconscious craving for simplicist conceptions--the transcendentalists\r\nclung fast to the notion of the absolute unity of type, of the ideal\r\nexistence of the \"one animal,\" and the evolutionists did precisely the\r\nsame thing when they blindly and instinctively accepted the doctrine of\r\nthe monophyletic descent of all animals from one primeval form. Geoffroy\r\npersisted in regarding Arthropods as being built on the same plan as\r\nVertebrates: Dohrn and Semper did nothing different when they derived\r\nboth groups from an ancestor combining the main characters of both. The\r\ndetermination to link together all the main phyla of the animal kingdom\r\nand to force them all into a single mould was common to evolutionary and\r\npre-evolutionary transcendentalists alike.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that all Metazoa develop from an ovum which is a simple\r\ncell, the evolutionists inferred that all must have arisen from one\r\nprimordial cell. From the fact that the next step in development is the\r\nsegmentation of the ovum, they argued that the ancestral Metazoa came\r\ninto being through the division of the primal Protozoon with aggregation\r\nof the division-products. From the fact that a gastrula stage is very\r\ncommonly formed when segmentation has been completed, they assumed that\r\nall germ-layered animals were descended from an ancestral Gastraea.\r\n\r\nThey quite ignored the possibility that a different explanation of the\r\nfacts might be given; they seized upon the simplest and most obvious\r\nsolution because it satisfied their overwhelming desire for\r\nsimplification. But is the simplest explanation always the\r\ntruest--especially when dealing with living things? One may be permitted\r\nto doubt it. It is easy to account for the structural resemblance of the\r\nmembers of a classificatory group, by the assumption that they are all\r\ndescended from a common ancestral form; it is easy to postulate any\r\nnumber of hypothetical generalised types; but in the absence of positive\r\nevidence, such simplicist explanations must always remain doubtful. The\r\nevolutionists, however, had no such scruples.\r\n\r\nPhylogenetic method differed in no way from transcendental--except\r\nperhaps that it had learnt from von Baer and from Darwin to give more\r\nweight to embryology. The criticisms passed by Cuvier and von Baer upon\r\nthe transcendentalists and their recapitulation theory might with equal\r\njustice be applied to the phylogenetic speculations which were based on\r\nthe biogenetic law. There was the same tendency to fix upon isolated\r\npoints of resemblance and disregard the rest of the organisation. Thus,\r\non the ground of a presumed analogy of certain structures to the\r\nvertebrate notochord, several invertebrate groups, as the Enteropneusta,\r\nthe Rhabdopleura, the Nemertea, were supposed to be, if not ancestral,\r\nat least offshoots from the direct line of vertebrate descent. And if\r\nother points of resemblance could in some of these cases be discovered,\r\nyet no successful attempt was made to show that the total organisation\r\nof any of these forms corresponded with that of the Vertebrate type.\r\nWith the possible exception of the Ascidian theory, all the numerous\r\ntheories of vertebrate descent suffered from this irremediable defect,\r\nand none carried complete conviction.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the efforts of the evolutionists, as of those of the\r\ntranscendentalists, the phyla or \"types\" remained distinct, or at best\r\nconnected by the most general of bonds.\r\n\r\nThe close affinity of transcendentalists and evolutionists is shown very\r\nclearly in their common contrast in habits of thought with the Cuvierian\r\nschool. It is the cardinal principle of pure morphology that function\r\nmust be excluded from consideration. This is a necessary and unavoidable\r\nsimplification which must be carried out if there is to be a science of\r\npure form at all. But this limitation of outlook, if carried over from\r\nmorphology to general biology becomes harmful, since it wilfully ignores\r\none whole side of life--and that the most important. The functional\r\npoint of view is clearly indispensable for any general understanding of\r\nliving things, and this is where the Cuvierian school has the advantage\r\nover the transcendental--its principles are applicable to biology in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nGeoffroy and Cuvier in pre-evolutionary times well typified the contrast\r\nbetween the formal and the functional standpoints. For Geoffroy form\r\ndetermined function, while for Cuvier function determined form. Geoffroy\r\nheld that Nature formed nothing new, but adapted existing \"materials of\r\norganisation\" to meet new needs. Cuvier, on the other hand, was always\r\nready to admit Nature's power to form entirely new organs in response to\r\nnew functional requirements.\r\n\r\nThe evolutionists followed Geoffroy rather than Cuvier. They laid great\r\nstore by homological resemblances, and dismissed analogies of structure\r\nas of little interest. They were singularly unwilling to admit the\r\nexistence of convergence or of parallel evolution, and they held very\r\nfirmly the distinctively Geoffroyan view that Nature is so limited by\r\nthe unity of composition that she can and does form no new organs.\r\n\r\nBy no one has this underlying principle of evolutionary morphology been\r\nmore explicitly recognised than by Hubrecht, who in his paper of 1887,\r\nafter summarising the points of resemblance between Nemertines and\r\nVertebrates which led him to assume a genetic connection between them,\r\nwrites as follows:--\"At the base of all the speculations contained in\r\nthis chapter lies the conviction, so strongly insisted upon by Darwin,\r\nthat new combinations or organs do not appear by the action of natural\r\nselection unless others have preceded, from which they are gradually\r\nderived by a slow change and differentiation.\r\n\r\n\"That a notochord should develop out of the archenteric wall because a\r\nsupporting axis would be beneficial to the animal may be a teleological\r\nassumption, but it is at the same time an evolutional heresy. It would\r\nnever be fruitful to try to connect the different variations offered,\r\n_e.g._, by the nervous system throughout the animal kingdom, if similar\r\nassumptions were admitted, for there would be then quite as much to say\r\nfor a repeated and independent origin of central nervous systems out of\r\nindifferent epiblast just as required in each special case. These would\r\nbe steps that might bring us back a good way towards the doctrine of\r\nindependent creations. The remembrance of Darwin's, Huxley's, and\r\nGegenbaur's classical foundations, and of Balfour's and Weismann's\r\nbrilliant superstructures, ought to warn us away from these dangerous\r\nregions\" (p. 644).\r\n\r\nThis same prejudice lies at the root of the idea of _Functionswechsel_,\r\nin spite of the general functional orientation of that idea.\r\n\r\nDohrn's constant assumption is that Nature makes shift with old organs\r\nwherever possible, instead of forming new ones. He derives gill-slits\r\nfrom segmental organs, fins and limbs from gills, ribs from gill-arches,\r\nand so on, instead of admitting that these organs might quite as well\r\nhave arisen independently. He objects on principle to the origin of\r\norgans _de novo_. Thus, rebutting the suggestion that certain organs\r\nwhich are not found in the lower Vertebrates might have arisen as new\r\nformations, he writes:--\"Against this supposition the whole weight of\r\nall those objections can be directed that are to be brought in general\r\nagainst the method of explanation which consists in appealing without\r\nimperative necessity to the _Deus ex machina_, 'New formation,' which is\r\nneither better nor worse than _Generatio equivoca_\" (p. 21).\r\n\r\nOf a similar nature was the objection to convergence.[456]\r\n\r\nWhy, we may ask, were morphologists so unwilling to admit the creative\r\npower of life? Dohrn, for instance, was fully aware of the great\r\ntransforming influence exerted by function upon form--his theory of\r\n_Functionswechsel_ regards as the most powerful agent of change the\r\nactivity of the animal, its effort to make the best use of its organs,\r\nto apply them at need in new ways to meet new demands. Why then did he\r\nnot go a step further and admit that the animal could by its own\r\nsubconscious efforts form entirely new organs? Why did most\r\nmorphologists join with him in belittling the organism's power of\r\nself-transformation?\r\n\r\nThe reasons seem to have been several. There is first the fundamental\r\nreason, that the idea of an active creative organism is repugnant to the\r\nintelligence, and that we try by all means in our power to substitute\r\nfor this some other conception. In so doing we instinctively fasten upon\r\nthe relatively less living side of organisms--their routine habits and\r\nreflexes, their routine structure--and ignore the essential activity\r\nwhich they manifest both in behaviour and in form-change.\r\n\r\nWe tend also to lay the causes of form-change, of evolution, as far as\r\npossible outside the living organism. With Darwin we seek the\r\ntransforming factors in the environment rather than within the organism\r\nitself. We fight shy of the Lamarckian conception that the living thing\r\nobscurely works out its own salvation by blind and instinctive effort.\r\nWe like to think of organisms as machines, as passive inventions[457]\r\ngradually perfected from generation to generation by some external\r\nagency, by environment or by natural selection, or what you will. All\r\nthis makes us chary of believing that Nature is prodigal of new organs.\r\n\r\nOther causes of the unwillingness of morphologists to admit the new\r\nformation of organs are to be sought in the main principle of pure\r\nmorphology itself, that the unity of plan imposes an iron limit upon\r\nadaptation, and in the powerful influence exercised at the time by\r\nmaterialistic habits of thought. Teleology had become a bugbear to the\r\nvast majority of biologists, and all real understanding of the Cuvierian\r\nattitude seems, in most cases, to have been lost, although, curiously\r\nenough, teleological conceptions were often unconsciously introduced in\r\nthe course of discussions on the \"utility\" of organs in the struggle for\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nEvolutionary morphology, being for the most part a form of pure or\r\nnon-functional morphology, agreed then in all essential respects with\r\npre-evolutionary or transcendental morphology.\r\n\r\nBut it contained the germ of a new conception which threw a new light\r\nupon the whole science of morphology. This was the conception of the\r\norganism as an historical being.\r\n\r\nWe have seen this thought expressed with the utmost clearness by Darwin\r\nhimself (_supra_, p. 233). In his eyes the structure and activities of\r\nthe living thing were a heritage from a remote past, the organism was a\r\nliving record of the achievements of its whole ancestral line. What a\r\nlight this conception threw upon all biology! \"When we no longer look at\r\nan organic being as a savage looks at a ship as something wholly beyond\r\nhis comprehension; when we regard every production of Nature as one\r\nwhich has had a long history; when we contemplate every complex\r\nstructure and instinct as the summing-up of many contrivances, each\r\nuseful to the possessor, in the same way as any great mechanical\r\ninvention is the summing-up of the labour, the experience, the reason,\r\nand even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each\r\norganic being, how far more interesting--I speak from experience--does\r\nthe study of natural history become!\" (_Origin_, 6th ed., pp. 665-6).\r\n\r\nSedgwick expressed the same thing from the morphological point of view\r\nwhen he wrote, with reference to the ancestral significance of the\r\nblastopore:--\"If there is anything in the theory of evolution, every\r\nchange in the embryo must have had a counterpart in the history of the\r\nrace, and it is our business as morphologists to find it out\" (p. 49,\r\n1884).\r\n\r\nBy the evolution-theory the problems of form were linked indissolubly\r\nwith the problem of heredity. Unity of plan could no longer be explained\r\nidealistically as the manifestation of Divine archetypal ideas; it had a\r\nreal historical basis, and was due to inheritance from a common\r\nancestor. The evolution-theory gave meaning and intelligibility to the\r\ntranscendental conception of the unity of plan; in particular it\r\nsupplied a simple and satisfying explanation of those puzzling vestigial\r\norgans, whose existence was such a stumbling-block to the teleologists.\r\nIt enabled the biogenetic law to be substituted for the laws of\r\nMeckel-Serres and von Baer, as being in some measure a combination and\r\ninterpretation of both.\r\n\r\nWhere the concept of evolution proved itself particularly useful was in\r\nthe interpretation of structures which were not immediately conditioned\r\nby adaptation to present requirements, such as, for instance, the\r\narrangement of gill-slits and aortic arches in the foetus of land\r\nVertebrates. Such \"heritage characters\" could only be explained on the\r\nhypothesis that they had once had functional or adaptational meaning.\r\nWhy, for instance, should the blastopore so often appear as a long slit,\r\nclosing by concrescence, unless this had been the original method of its\r\nformation in remote Coelenterate ancestors?\r\n\r\nThe point hardly requires elaboration, since it has become an integral\r\npart of all our thinking on biological problems. It may be as well,\r\nhowever, for the sake of continuity, to give one or two examples of the\r\nhistorical interpretation of animal structures. The first may\r\nconveniently be the phylogenetic interpretation of the contrast between\r\n\"membrane\" and \"cartilage\" bones.\r\n\r\nIn his _Grundzuege_ of 1870, Gegenbaur made the suggestion that the\r\ninvesting or membrane bones were derived phylogenetically from\r\nintegumentary ossifications, and this was worked out in detail a few\r\nyears later by O. Hertwig.[458]\r\n\r\nMany years before, several observers--J. Mueller, Williamson, and\r\nSteenstrup--had been struck with the resemblance existing between the\r\nplacoid scales and the teeth of Elasmobranch fishes. Hertwig followed up\r\nthis clue, and came to the conclusion not only that placoid scales and\r\nteeth were strictly homologous, but also that all membrane bones were\r\nderived phylogenetically from ossifications present in the skin or in\r\nthe mucous membrane of the mouth, just as cartilage bones were derived\r\nfrom the cartilaginous skeletons of the primitive Vertebrates. In some\r\ncases this manner of derivation could even be observed in ontogeny, as\r\nReichert had seen in the Newt, where certain bones in the roof of the\r\nmouth are actually formed by the concrescence of little teeth, (_supra_,\r\np. 163). Hertwig considered that the following bones were originally\r\nformed by coalescence of teeth--parasphenoid, vomer, palatine,\r\npterygoid, the tooth-bearing part of the pre-maxillary, the maxillary,\r\nthe dentary and certain bones of the hyo-mandibular skeleton of\r\nTeleosts. All the investing bones (_Deckknochen_) of the skull were of\r\ncommon origin, and could be traced back to integumentary skeletal\r\nplates, which in the ancestral fish formed a dense carapace.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions were accepted by Koelliker himself, who wrote in his\r\n_Entwickelungsgeschichte_ (1879)--\"The distinction between the primary\r\nor primordial, and the investing or secondary bones is from the\r\nmorphological standpoint sharp and definite. The former are\r\nossifications of the (cartilaginous) primordial skeleton, the latter are\r\nformed outside this skeleton, and are probably all ossifications of the\r\nskin or the mucous membrane\" (p. 464).\r\n\r\nGegenbaur[459] consistently upheld the phylogenetic derivation of\r\ninvesting bones from dermal ossifications, and even went further and\r\nderived substitutionary bones as well from the integument, thus\r\nestablishing a direct comparison between the skeletal formations of\r\nVertebrates and Invertebrates. Investing bones were actual integumentary\r\nossifications which had gradually sunk beneath the skin to become part\r\nof the internal skeleton; substitutionary bones were produced by cells\r\n(osteoblasts) which were ultimately derived from the integument.[460]\r\n\r\nA further instance of the historical interpretation of animal structure,\r\ntaken from quite a different field, is afforded by the speculations of\r\nDollo[461] on the ancestral history of the Marsupials. In a brilliant\r\npaper of 1880[462] Huxley made the suggestion that the ancestors of\r\nMarsupials were arboreal forms. \"I think it probable,\" he wrote, \"from\r\nthe character of the pes, that the primitive forms, whence the existing\r\nMarsupialia have been derived, were arboreal animals; and it is not\r\ndifficult, I conceive, to see that, with such habits, it may have been\r\nhighly advantageous to an animal to get rid of its young from the\r\ninterior of its body at as early a period of development as possible,\r\nand to supply it with nourishment during the later periods through the\r\nlacteal glands, rather than through an imperfect form of placenta\" (p.\r\n655). Dollo followed up this suggestion, which had in the meantime been\r\nstrengthened by Hill's discovery of a true allantoic placenta in\r\n_Perameles_, by demonstrating in the foot of present-day Marsupials\r\ncertain features which could only be interpreted as inherited from a\r\ntime when the ancestors of Marsupials were tree-living animals. These\r\nwere the occurrence of an opposable big toe (when this was present at\r\nall), the great development of the fourth toe, the reduction and partial\r\nsyndactylism of the second and third toes, and in some cases the\r\nregression of the nails. These characters were shown to be typical of\r\narboreal Vertebrates, and their occurrence in forms not arboreal\r\nindicated that these were descended from tree-living ancestors. Traces\r\nof an arboreal ancestry could be demonstrated even in the marsupial mole\r\n_Notoryctes_.\r\n\r\nThese are only two examples out of hundreds that might be given. Present\r\nday structure was interpreted in the light of past history; the common\r\nelement in organic form was seen to be due to common descent; the\r\nexistence of vestigial and non-functional organs was no longer a riddle.\r\n\r\nThere was even a tendency to concentrate attention upon the historical\r\nside of structure, upon what the animal passively inherited rather than\r\nupon what it personally achieved. Homologies were considered more\r\ninteresting than analogies, vestigial organs more interesting than\r\nfoetal and larval adaptations. Convergence was anathema. The dead-weight\r\nof the past was appreciated at its full and more than its full value;\r\nand the essential vital activity of the living thing, so clearly shown\r\nin development and regeneration, was ignored or forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut evolutionary morphology for all practical purposes was a development\r\nof pure or idealistic morphology, and was powerless to bring to fruit\r\nthe new conception with which evolution-theory had enriched it. The\r\nreason is not far to seek. Pure morphology is essentially a science of\r\ncomparison which seeks to disentangle the unity hidden beneath the\r\ndiversity of organic form. It is not immediately concerned with the\r\ncauses of organic diversity--that is rather the task of the sciences of\r\nthe individual, heredity and development. To take an example--the\r\nrecapitulation theory may legitimately be used as a law of pure\r\nmorphology, as stating the abstract relation of ontogeny to phylogeny,\r\nand the probable line of descent of any organism may be deduced from it,\r\nas a mere matter of the ideal derivation of one form from another; but\r\nan explanation of the reason for the recapitulation of ancestral history\r\nduring development can clearly not be given by pure morphology unaided.\r\nFrom the fact that the common starfish shows in the course of its\r\ndevelopment distinct traces of a stalk[463] it is possible to infer,\r\ntaking other evidence also into consideration, that the ancestors of the\r\nstarfish were at one stage of their existence stalked and sessile\r\norganisms. But this leaves unanswered the question as to how and why the\r\nstarfish does still repeat after so many millions of years part of the\r\norganisation of one of its remote ancestors. Why is this feature\r\nretained, and by what means has it been conserved through countless\r\ngenerations? It is clear that the answer can be given only by a science\r\nof the causes of the production and retention of form, by a causal\r\nmorphology, based upon a study of heredity and development.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the pure morphologist the recapitulation\r\ntheory is an instrument of research enabling him to reconstruct probable\r\nlines of descent; from the standpoint of the student of development and\r\nheredity the fact of recapitulation is a difficult problem whose\r\nsolution would perhaps give the key to a true understanding of the real\r\nnature of heredity.\r\n\r\nTo make full use of the conception of the organism as an historical\r\nbeing it is necessary then to understand the causal nexus between\r\nontogeny and phylogeny.\r\n\r\nWe shall see in the next chapter that the transformation of morphology\r\nfrom a comparative to a causal science did take place towards the end of\r\nthe century, and that some progress was made towards an understanding of\r\nthe relation between individual development and ancestral history,\r\nparticularly by Roux and Samuel Butler, working with the fruitful\r\nLamarckian conception of the transforming power of function.\r\n\r\n    [456] The importance of convergence came to be realised\r\n    after the vogue of phylogenetic speculation had\r\n    passed--see Friedmann, _Die Konvergenz der Organismen_,\r\n    Berlin, 1904, and A. Willey, _Convergence in Evolution_,\r\n    London, 1911. Also L. Vialleton, _Elements de\r\n    morphologie des Vertebres_, Paris, 1912.\r\n\r\n    [457] From this point of view there is a very profound\r\n    analogy between artificial and natural selection. Upon\r\n    the theory of natural selection organisms are lifeless\r\n    constructs which are mechanically perfected by external\r\n    agency, just as machines are improved by a process of\r\n    conscious selection of the most successful among a\r\n    number of competing models.

No serious attempt had been made to discover the\r\ncauses which led to the production of form in the individual and in the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nIt is true that evolution-theory had offered a simple solution of the\r\ngreat problem of the unity in diversity of animal forms, but this\r\nsolution was formal merely, and went little beyond that abstract\r\ndeduction of more complex from simpler forms, which had been the main\r\noperation of pre-evolutionary morphology. Little was known of the actual\r\ncauses of ontogeny, and nothing at all of the causes of phylogeny; it\r\nwas, for instance, mere rhetoric on Haeckel's part to proclaim that\r\nphylogeny was the mechanical cause of ontogeny.\r\n\r\nAnimal physiology, on its side, had developed in complete isolation from\r\nmorphology into a science of the functioning of the adult and finished\r\nanimal, considered as a more or less stable physico-chemical mechanism.\r\nSince the days of Ludwig, Claude Bernard and E. du Bois Reymond, the\r\nphysiologists' chief care had been to analyse vital activities into\r\ntheir component physical and chemical processes, and to trace out the\r\ninterchange of matter and energy between the organism and its\r\nenvironment. Physiologists had left untouched, perhaps wisely, the much\r\nmore difficult problem of the causes of the development of form. For all\r\npractical purposes they took the animal-machine as given, and did not\r\ntrouble about its mode of origin. They held indeed that form-production\r\nwas due to a complex of physico-chemical causes, which they hoped some\r\nday to unravel;[464] but this future physiology of development remained\r\nquite embryonic.\r\n\r\nPhysiology then had not really come into contact with the problems of\r\nform, and it could give the morphologist no direct help when he turned\r\nto investigate the causes of form-production. It had, however, a\r\ndetermining influence upon the methods of those who first broke ground\r\nin this No Man's Land between morphology proper and physiology. But it\r\nis significant that it was a morphologist and not a physiologist that\r\ndid the first spade-work.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer in this field, both as investigator and as thinker, was W.\r\nRoux, who sketched in the 'eighties the main outlines of a new science\r\nof causal morphology, to which he gave the name of\r\n_Entwicklungsmechanik_. The choice of name was deliberate, and the word\r\nimplied, first, that the new science was essentially an investigation of\r\nthe development of form, not of the mode of action of a formed\r\nmechanism, and second, that the methods to be adopted were\r\nmechanistic.[465]\r\n\r\nThough Roux was the only begetter of the science of\r\n_Entwicklungsmechanik_, he was, of course, not the first to investigate\r\nexperimentally the formative processes of animal life. Study of\r\nregeneration dates back to Trembley (1740-44), Reaumur (1742), Bonnet\r\n(1745), and Spallanzani (1768-82),[466] and in the years preceding Roux's\r\nactivity good work was done by Philipeaux. A beginning had been made\r\nwith experimental teratology by E. Geoffroy St Hilaire and others, and\r\nthe work of C. Dareste[467] remains classical. Back in the 18th century,\r\nsome of John Hunter's experiments had a bearing upon the problems of\r\nform; his work on transplantation was followed up in the 19th century by\r\nFlourens, P. Bert, Ollier and many others. In founding in 1872 the\r\n_Archives de Zoologie experimentale et generale_ H. de Lacaze-Duthiers\r\nput forward in his introduction a powerful plea for the use of the\r\nexperimental method in zoology.\r\n\r\nIn some ways more directly connected with _Entwicklungsmechanik_ was\r\nHis's attempt in 1874[468] to explain on mechanical principles the\r\nformation of certain of the embryonic organs by the bendings and\r\nfoldings of tubes or plates of cells. \"His compared the various layers\r\nof the chick embryo to elastic plates and tubes; out of these he\r\nsuggested that some of the principal organs might be moulded by mere\r\nlocal inequalities of growth--the ventricles of the brain, for instance,\r\nthe alimentary canal, the heart--and he further succeeded in imitating\r\nthe formation of these organs by folding, pinching, and cutting\r\nindia-rubber tubes and plates in various ways.\"[469]\r\n\r\nBut Roux was undoubtedly the first to make a systematic survey of the\r\nproblems to be solved and to work out an organised method of attack. His\r\nearliest work deals with the important problem of functional\r\nadaptation--its importance to the organism, and its possible mechanistic\r\nexplanation. The first paper[470] was a study of the branching and\r\ndistribution of the arteries in the human body (1878), and a second\r\npaper on the same subject followed in 1879.[471]\r\n\r\nIn these papers Roux showed how the development of the blood-vascular\r\nsystem was largely determined by direct adaptation to functional\r\nrequirements, and he inferred the existence in the vascular tissues of\r\ncertain vital properties, in virtue of which the functional adaptation\r\nof the blood-vessels came about. Thus the intima or inner lining must\r\npossess the faculty of so reacting to the friction set up by the\r\nblood-current as to oppose the least possible resistance to its flow;\r\nthe muscular coats must react to increased pressure by growing thicker,\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nThese papers were followed in 1881 by his well-known book, _Der Kampf\r\nder Theile im Organismus_, which contained the working-out of his\r\nmechanistic explanation of functional adaptation, and most of the\r\nelements of his general \"causal-analytical\" theory of form production.\r\nThe significance of the book was popularly considered at the time to lie\r\nin its supposed application of the selection idea to the explanation of\r\nthe internal adaptedness of animal structure--in the theory of \"cellular\r\nselection,\" and the book owed its success to its fitting in so well with\r\nthe prevalent Darwinism of the day. But its real importance, as a big\r\nstep towards causal morphology, was naturally not so fully appreciated.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years Roux continued his studies on functional\r\nadaptation,[472] and at the same time made a new departure by\r\ninaugurating, almost contemporaneously with the physiologist Pflueger,\r\nthe study of experimental embryology. Isolated observations had\r\npreviously been made upon the development of single blastomeres or parts\r\nof blastulae, by Haeckel and Chun for instance,[473] but Roux[474] and\r\nPflueger[475] were the first to investigate the subject systematically,\r\nchoosing for their work the egg of the frog.[476] Roux continued for many\r\nyears to follow up this line of work.[477]\r\n\r\nIn 1890 he drew up a programme and manifesto[478] of\r\n_Entwicklungsmechanik_ as \"an anatomical science of the future,\" and in\r\n1895 he founded the famous _Archiv fuer Entwicklungsmechanik_,[479]\r\npublishing in the same year the two large volumes of his collected\r\npapers,[480] of which the first volume dealt with functional adaptation,\r\nthe second with experimental embryology.\r\n\r\nHis subsequent work includes several important general papers;[481]\r\nbesides a number of special memoirs dealing with the factors of\r\ndevelopment, and with his original subject, functional adaptation.[482]\r\n\r\nIn our sketch of his views we shall have occasion to refer particularly\r\nto his publications of 1881, 1895 (the _Einleitung_), 1902, 1905, and\r\n1910.\r\n\r\nAlthough Roux's biological philosophy is out-and-out mechanistic, he yet\r\nrecognises the difficulty, even the impossibility, of straightway\r\nreducing development to the physico-chemical level. He tries to steer a\r\ncourse midway between the simplicist conceptions of the materialists and\r\nthe \"metaphysics\" of the neo-vitalist school, which the experimental\r\nstudy of development and regeneration soon brought into being. In 1895\r\nhe writes:--\"The too simple mechanistic conception on the one hand, and\r\nthe metaphysical conception on the other represent the Scylla and\r\nCharybdis, between which to sail is indeed difficult, and so far by few\r\nsatisfactorily accomplished; it cannot be denied that with the increase\r\nof knowledge the seduction of the second has lately notably increased\"\r\n(p. 23).\r\n\r\nThe _via media_ adopted by Roux is the analysis of development, not\r\ndirectly into simple physico-chemical processes, but into more complex\r\norganic processes dependent upon the fundamental properties of living\r\nmatter. The aim of _Entwicklungsmechanik_ is defined by Roux to be the\r\nreduction of developmental events to the fewest and simplest\r\n_Wirkungsweisen_, or causal processes.[483] Two classes of causal\r\nprocesses may be distinguished, as \"complex components\" and \"simple\r\ncomponents\" of development. The latter are directly explicable by the\r\nlaws of physics and chemistry; the former, while in essence\r\nphysico-chemical, are yet so very complicated that they cannot at\r\npresent be reduced to physico-chemical terms. The ultimate aim of\r\n_Entwicklungsmechanik_ is to reduce development to its \"simple\r\ncomponents,\" but its main task at the present day and for many years to\r\ncome is the analysis of development into its \"complex components.\"\r\n\r\nThese complex components must be accepted as having much of the validity\r\nof physical and chemical laws. They are mysterious in the sense that\r\nthey cannot yet be explained mechanistically, but they are constant in\r\ntheir action, and under the same conditions produce always the same\r\neffect--hence they may be made the subject of strictly scientific study.\r\nThey represent biological generalisations, in their way of equal\r\nvalidity with the generalisations of physics and chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe principal \"complex components\" which Roux recognises are somewhat as\r\nfollows:--First come the elementary cell-functions of assimilation and\r\ndissimilation, growth, reproduction and heredity, movement and\r\nself-division (as a special co-ordination of cell-movements). Then at a\r\nsomewhat higher level, self-differentiation, and the trophic reaction to\r\nfunctional stimuli. Components of even greater complexity may also be\r\ndistinguished, as, for instance, the biogenetic law. The various\r\ntropisms exhibited in development may be regarded as \"directive\" complex\r\ncomponents. There must be added, not as being itself a component, but\r\nrather as a mode or peculiar property of all functioning, the\r\nomnipresent faculty of self-regulation.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that Roux's \"complex components\" are simply the\r\ngeneral properties or functions of organised matter.\r\n\r\nExpressing Roux's thought in another way, we might say that life can\r\nonly be defined functionally, _i.e._, by an enumeration of the \"complex\r\ncomponents\" or elementary functions which all living beings manifest,\r\neven down to the very simplest. \"Living beings,\" writes Roux, \"can at\r\npresent be defined with any approach to completeness only functionally,\r\nthat is to say, through characterisation of their activities, for we\r\nhave an adequate acquaintance with their functions in a general way,\r\nthough our knowledge of particulars is by no means complete\" (p. 105,\r\n1905). Defined in the most general and abstract way, living things are\r\nmaterial objects which persist in spite of their metabolism, and, by\r\nreason of their power of self-regulation, in spite also of the changes\r\nof the environment. This is the \"functional minimum-definition of life\"\r\n(pp. 106-7, 1905).\r\n\r\nWe may now go on to consider the relation of function to form throughout\r\nthe course of development. Roux distinguishes in all development two\r\nperiods, in the first of which the organ is formed prior to and\r\nindependent of its function, while in the second the differentiation and\r\ngrowth of the organ are dependent on its functioning. Latterly (1906 and\r\n1910) Roux has distinguished three periods, counting as the second the\r\ntransition period when form is partly self-determined, partly determined\r\nby functioning. As this conception of Roux's is of the greatest\r\nimportance we shall follow it out in some detail.\r\n\r\nThe idea was first elaborated in the _Kampf der Theile_ (1881), where he\r\nwrote:--\"There must be distinguished in the life of all the parts two\r\nperiods, an embryonic in the broad sense, during which the parts\r\ndevelop, differentiate and grow of themselves, and a period of completer\r\ndevelopment, during which growth, and in many cases also the balance of\r\nassimilation over dissimilation, can come about only under the influence\r\nof stimuli\" (p. 180). There is thus a period of self-differentiation in\r\nwhich the organs are roughly formed in anticipation of functioning, and\r\na period of functional development in which the organs are perfected\r\nthrough functioning and only through functioning. The two periods cannot\r\nbe sharply separated from one another, nor does the transition from the\r\none to the other occur at the same time in the different tissues and\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nThe conception is more fully expressed in 1905 as follows:--\"This\r\nseparation (of development into two periods) is intended only as a first\r\nbeginning. The first period I called the embryonic period [Greek: kat'\r\nexochen] or the period of organ-rudiments. It includes the 'directly\r\ninherited' structures, _i.e._, the structures which are directly\r\npredetermined in the structure of the germ-plasm, as, for instance, the\r\nfirst differentiation of the germ, segmentation, the formation of the\r\ngerm-layers and the organ-rudiments, as well as the next stage of\r\n'further differentiation,' and of _independent_ growth and maintenance,\r\nthat is, of growth and maintenance which take place without the\r\nfunctioning of the organs.\r\n\r\n\"This is accordingly the period of direct fashioning through the\r\nactivity of the formative mechanism implicit in the germ-plasm, also the\r\nperiod of the self-conservation of the formed parts without active\r\nfunctioning.\r\n\r\n\"The second period is the period of 'functional form-development.' It\r\nincludes the further differentiation and the maintenance in their\r\ntypical form of the organs laid down in the first period; and this is\r\nbrought about by the exercise of the specific functions of the organs.\r\nThis period adds the finishing touches to the finer functional\r\ndifferentiation of the organs, and so brings to pass the 'finer\r\nfunctional harmony' of all organs with the whole. The formative activity\r\ndisplayed during this period depends upon the circumstance that the\r\nfunctional stimulus, or rather the exercise by the organs of their\r\nspecific functions, is accompanied by a subsidiary formative activity,\r\nwhich acts partly by producing new form and partly by maintaining that\r\nwhich is already formed.... Between the two periods lies presumably a\r\ntransition period, an intermediary stage of varying duration in the\r\ndifferent organs, in which both classes of causes are concerned in the\r\nfurther building-up of the already formed, those of the first period in\r\ngradually decreasing measure, those of the second in an increasing\r\ndegree\" (pp. 94-6, 1905).\r\n\r\nIn the first period the organ forms or determines the function, in the\r\nsecond period the function forms the organ, or at least completes its\r\ndifferentiation. It is characteristic that in the first period\r\nfunctionally adapted structure appears in the complete absence of the\r\nfunctional stimulus.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the difference between the two periods is to be found\r\nin the different evolutionary history of the characters formed during\r\neach. First-period characters are _inherited_ characters, and taken\r\ntogether constitute the historical basis of the organism's form and\r\nactivity; second-period characters are those of later acquirement which\r\nhave not yet become incorporated in the racial heritage.\r\n\r\nInherited characters appear in development in the absence of the\r\nstimulus that originally called them forth; acquired characters are\r\nthose that have not yet freed themselves from this dependence upon the\r\nfunctional stimulus. First-period characters were originally, like\r\nsecond-period characters, entirely dependent for their development upon\r\nthe functional stimuli in response to which they arose, and only\r\ngradually in the course of generations did they gain that independence\r\nof the functional stimulus which stamps them as true inherited\r\ncharacters. Speaking of the formative stimuli which are active in\r\nsecond-period development, Roux writes:--\"These stimuli can also produce\r\nnew structure, which if it is constantly formed throughout many\r\ngenerations finally becomes hereditary, _i.e._, develops in the\r\ndescendants in the absence of the stimuli, becomes in our sense\r\nembryonic\" (p. 180, 1881). Again, \"form-characteristics which were\r\noriginally acquired in post-embryonic life through functional adaptation\r\nmay be developed in the embryo without the functional stimulus, and may\r\nin later development become more or less completely differentiated, and\r\nretain this differentiation without functional activity or with a\r\nminimum of it. But in the continued absence of functional activity they\r\nbecome atrophied ... and in the end disappear\" (p. 201, 1881).\r\n\r\nThis conception of the nature of hereditary transmission is an important\r\none, and constitutes the first big step towards a real understanding of\r\nthe historical element in organic form and activity. It supplies a\r\npractical criterion for the distinguishing of \"heritage\" characters from\r\nacquired characters, of palingenetic from cenogenetic--a criterion which\r\ndescriptive morphology was unable to find.[484] The introduction of a\r\nfunctional moment into the concept of heredity was a methodological\r\nadvance of the first importance, for it linked up in an understandable\r\nway the problems of embryology, and indirectly of all morphology, with\r\nthe problem of hereditary transmission, and gave form and substance to\r\nthe conception of the organism as an historical being.\r\n\r\nIt is this element in Roux's theories that puts them so far in advance\r\nof those of Weismann. Weismann did not really tackle the big problem of\r\nthe relation of form to function, and he left no place in his mechanical\r\nsystem of preformation for functional or second-period development; he\r\nconceived all development to be in Roux's sense embryonic, and due to\r\nthe automatic unpacking of a complex germinal organisation. Roux himself\r\nwas to a certain extent a preformationist, for the development of his\r\nfirst-period characters is conditioned by the inherited organisation of\r\nthe germ-plasm, and is purely automatic. It was indeed his experiments\r\non the frog's egg (1888) that supplied some of the strongest evidence in\r\nfavour of the mosaic theory of development. The number of _Anlagen_\r\nwhich he postulates in the germ is however small, and the germ-plasm in\r\nhis conception of it has a relatively simple structure (p. 103, 1905).\r\n\r\nThe transmission of acquired characters forms, of course, an integral\r\npart of Roux's conception of heredity and development, for without this\r\ntransmission second-stage characters could not be transformed into\r\nfirst-stage characters. He discusses this difficult question at some\r\nlength in the _Kampf der Theile_, coming to the conclusion that such\r\ntransmission takes place in small degree and gradually, and that many\r\ngenerations are required before a new character can become hereditary.\r\nHe thinks that acquired characters are probably transmitted at the\r\nchemical level. It is conceivable that acquired form-changes are\r\ndependent on chemical changes, or are correlative with such, and that,\r\nsince the germ-cells stand in close metabolic relations with the soma,\r\nthese chemical changes may soak through to the germ-cells and so modify\r\nthem that a predisposition will appear in the descendants towards\r\nsimilar form-changes.[485] From this point of view the problem of\r\ntransmission might be merged in the broader problem of the production of\r\nform through chemical processes--the central problem of all development.\r\n\r\nInherited characters develop by an automatic process of\r\nself-differentiation, and the separate parts of the embryo show during\r\nthis first period a surprising functional independence of one another.\r\nBut this state of things changes progressively as the second period is\r\nreached, until finally all form-production and maintenance and all\r\ncorrelation depend upon functioning. It is in the first period of\r\nautomatic development through internal \"determining\" factors that the\r\n\"developmental\" functions in the strict sense, _e.g._ automatic growth,\r\ndivision and self-differentiation, are most clearly shown. In the second\r\nor \"functional\" period the formative influence of function upon\r\nstructure comes into play, and development becomes largely a matter of\r\n\"functional adaptation\" to functional requirements.\r\n\r\nAll structure, according to Roux, is either functional or\r\nnon-functional. The former includes all structure that is adapted to\r\nsubserve some function. \"Such 'functional structures' are, for example,\r\nthe composition of striated muscle fibres out of fibrillae and these out\r\nof muscle-prisms, or again the length and thickness of the muscles, the\r\nstatic structure of the bones, the composition of the stomach and the\r\nblood-vessels out of longitudinal and circular fibres, the external\r\nshape of the vertebral centra and of the cuneiform bones of the foot\"\r\n(p. 73, 1910). Indeed, as Cuvier had already pointed out, practically\r\nevery organ in the body shows a functional structure which is accurately\r\nand minutely adjusted to the function it is intended to perform. Thus,\r\nto take some further examples, the arteries are admirably adapted as\r\nregards size of lumen, elasticity of wall, direction of branching, to\r\nconduct the blood to all parts of the body with the least possible waste\r\nof the propelling power through frictional resistance. So, too, the\r\nspongy substance of the long bones is arranged in lamellae which take the\r\ndirection of the principal stresses and strains which fall upon the\r\nbones in action.\r\n\r\nFunctional structure may be formed either in the first or in the second\r\nperiod of development, may be either inherited or acquired, but it\r\nreaches its full differentiation only in the second period, _i.e._,\r\nunder the influence of functioning. Practically speaking, functional\r\nstructure is directly dependent for its full development and for its\r\ncontinued conservation upon the exercise of the particular function\r\nwhich it serves. In the second period, but not in the first, increased\r\nuse leads to hypertrophy of the functional structure, disuse to atrophy.\r\n\r\nFrom functional structure is to be distinguished nonfunctional\r\nstructure, which has no relation to the bodily functions--is neither\r\nadapted to perform any of these, nor has arisen as a by-product of\r\nfunctional activity. \"To this category belong, for example, among\r\ntypical structures, the triangular form of the cross-section of the\r\ntibia, the dolicocephalic or brachycephalic shape of the skull, most of\r\nthe external characters distinguishing genera and species, many of the\r\nexternal features of the embryo which change in the course of\r\ndevelopment, besides most of the abnormal forms shown by monstrosities,\r\ntumours, etc.\" (p. 74, 1910). Non-functional structure is not affected\r\nby functional adaptation, and may accordingly be left out of\r\nconsideration here.\r\n\r\nNow the influence of functioning upon the form and structure of an organ\r\nis twofold. There is first the immediate change brought about by the\r\nvery act of functioning--for example, the shortening and thickening of\r\nskeletal muscles when they act. This is a purely temporary change, for\r\nthe organ at once returns to its normal quiescent state as soon as it\r\nceases to function. Such temporary functional change, brought about in\r\nthe moment of functioning, is usually dependent for its initiation upon\r\nsome neuro-muscular mechanism, though it may be elicited also by a\r\nchemical stimulus. It is thus always a phenomenon of \"behaviour.\" \"From\r\nsuch temporary changes are sharply to be distinguished all permanent\r\nalterations which first appear in perceptible fashion through\r\noft-repeated or long-continued, enhanced functional activity. These\r\nproduce a new and lasting internal equilibrium of the organ, consisting\r\nin an insertion of new molecules or a rearrangement of old. For this\r\nreason they outlast the periods of functional form-change, or, if as in\r\nthe case of the muscles they themselves alter during functional\r\nactivity, they regain their state when the organ ceases to function\" (p.\r\n72, 1910). \"Oft-repeated exercise or heightened exercise of the specific\r\nfunctions, or repeated action of the functional stimuli which determine\r\nthem, produces, as we have said before, true form-changes as a\r\nby-product. These are of two kinds. In so far as these form-changes\r\nfacilitate the repetition of the specific functions, I have called them\r\n_functional adaptations_.... Such as do not improve the functioning of\r\nthe organ are indeed by-products of functioning, but without adaptive\r\ncharacter; they do not belong to the class of functional adaptations at\r\nall\" (p. 75, 1910).\r\n\r\nWe may now enquire in what way functional adaptations can arise as\r\nby-products of functioning.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that natural selection in the sense of individual or\r\n\"personal\" selection cannot adequately explain the origin of functional\r\nstructure and the functional harmony of structure, for thousands of\r\ncells would have to vary together in a purposive way before any real\r\nadvantage could be gained in the struggle for existence, and it is in\r\nthe highest degree unlikely that this should come about by chance\r\nvariation.[486] The development of purposive internal structure is only to\r\nbe explained by the properties of the tissues concerned.\r\n\r\nIn illustration and proof of the statement that functional adaptation is\r\ndue to the properties of the tissues we may adduce the development and\r\nregulation of the blood-vascular system, which has been thoroughly\r\nstudied from this point of view by Roux and Oppel (1910).\r\n\r\nIt appears that only the very first rudiments of the vascular system are\r\nlaid down in the short first period of automatic non-functional\r\ndevelopment. All the subsequent growth and differentiation of the\r\nblood-vessels falls into the second period, and is due wholly or in\r\ngreat part to direct functional adaptation to the requirements of the\r\ntissues. Thus from the rudiments formed in the first period there sprout\r\nout the definitive vessels in direct adaptation to the food-consumption\r\nof the tissues they are to supply. The size, direction and intimate\r\nstructure of these vessels are accurately adjusted to the part they play\r\nin the economy of the whole, and this adjustment is brought about in\r\nvirtue of the peculiar properties or reaction-capabilities of the\r\ndifferent tissues of which the blood-vessels are composed.\r\n\r\nThe properties which Roux finds himself compelled to postulate in the\r\nvascular tissues, after a thorough-going analysis of the different kinds\r\nof functional adaptation shown by the blood-vessels, are summarised by\r\nhim as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"(1) The faculty--depending on a direct sensibility possessed by the\r\nendothelium and perhaps also by the other layers of the intima--of\r\nyielding to the impact of the blood, so far as the external relations of\r\nthe vessel permit. In this way the wall adapts itself to the\r\nhaemodynamically conditioned 'natural' shape of the blood-stream, and\r\nreaches this shape as nearly as possible.\" Through this faculty of the\r\nlining tissue of the blood-vessels, the size of the lumen and the\r\ndirection of branching are so regulated as to oppose the least possible\r\nresistance to the flow of the blood.\r\n\r\n\"(2) The faculty possessed by the endothelium of the capillaries of each\r\norgan of adapting itself qualitatively to the particular metabolism of\r\nthe organ.\" This adaptedness of the capillaries is, however, more\r\nusually an inherited state, _i.e._, brought about in the first period of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\"(3) The faculty possessed by the capillary walls of being stimulated to\r\nsprout out and branch by increased functioning, _i.e._, by increased\r\ndiffusion, and their power to exhibit a chemically conditioned\r\ncytotropism, which causes the sprouts to find one another and unite. A\r\nsimilar process can be directly observed in isolated segmentation-cells,\r\nwhich tend to unite in consequence of a power of mutual attraction.\r\n\r\n\"(4) The faculty of developing normal arterial walls in response to\r\nstrong intermittent pressure, and normal venous walls in response to\r\ncontinuous lesser pressure.\" It has been shown, for instance, by Fischer\r\nand Schmieden that in dogs a section of vein transplanted into an artery\r\ntakes on an arterial structure, at least as regards the circular\r\nmusculature, which doubles in thickness.\r\n\r\n\"(5) The power to regulate the normal[487] length of the arteries and\r\nveins, in adaptation to the growth of the surrounding tissues, in such a\r\nway that the stretching action of the blood-stream brings the vessel to\r\nits proper functional length.\r\n\r\n\"(6) The power to form, in response to slight increases in longitudinal\r\ntension, new structural parts which take their place alongside the\r\nexisting longitudinal fibres.\r\n\r\n\"(7) The power to regulate the width of the circular musculature\r\naccording to the degree of food-consumption by the tissues, in response\r\nto nerve impulses initiated in these tissues.\r\n\r\n\"(8) The power possessed by the circular musculature of responding to\r\nsuch continuous functional widening, by the formation of new structural\r\nparts in the circular musculature, and so of widening the vessel\r\npermanently or by this new formation of muscular fibres thickening the\r\ncircular musculature.\r\n\r\n\"(9) The faculty of being stimulated by increased blood-pressure to\r\nproduce the same structural changes as mentioned in par. 8, though here\r\nthe response is otherwise conditioned\" (pp. 126-7, 1910).\r\n\r\nIt is by virtue of the tissue-properties detailed above that the complex\r\nfunctional adaptations of the blood-vessels come about.\r\n\r\nThe development of the vascular system is no mere automatic and\r\nmechanical production of form, apart from and independent of\r\nfunctioning; it implies a living and co-ordinated activity of the\r\ntissues and organs concerned, a power of active response to foreseen and\r\nunforeseen contingencies. Form is then not something fixed and\r\ncongealed--it is the ever-changing manifestation of functional activity.\r\n\"Since most of the structure and form of the blood-vessels arises in\r\ndirect adaptation to function, the vessels of adult men and animals are\r\nno fixed structures, which, once formed, retain their form and\r\nstructural build unchanged throughout life; on the contrary, they\r\nrequire even for their continued existence the stimulus of functional\r\nactivity.... The fully formed blood-vessels are no static structures,\r\nsuch as they appear to be according to the teaching of normal histology,\r\nand such as they have long been taken to be. Observation and description\r\nof normal development never shows us anything but the visible side of\r\norganic happenings, the _products_ of activity, and leaves us ignorant\r\nof the real processes of form-development and form-conservation, and of\r\ntheir causes\" (p. 125, 1910).\r\n\r\nThe real thing in organisation is not form but activity. It is in this\r\nreturn to the Cuvierian or functional attitude to the problems of form\r\nthat we hold Roux's greatest service to biology to consist. The\r\nattitude, however, seems to smack of vitalism, and Roux, as we have\r\nseen, is no vitalist. He holds that the marvellous and apparently\r\npurposive tissue-qualities which underlie all processes of functional\r\nadaptation have arisen \"naturally,\" in the course of evolution, by the\r\naction of natural selection upon the various properties, useful and\r\nuseless, which appeared fortuitously in the primary living organisms. He\r\nis, moreover, deeply imbued with the materialistic philosophy of his\r\nyouth, and it is indeed one of the chief characteristics of his system\r\nthat he states the fundamental properties or qualities of life in terms\r\nof metabolism. A vital quality is for Roux a special process or mode of\r\nassimilation. The faculty of \"morphological assimilation\" whereby form\r\nis imposed upon formless chemical processes is the ultimate term of\r\nRoux's analysis--\"the most general, most essential, and most\r\ncharacteristic formative activity of life\" (p. 631, 1902).\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider very briefly the early results achieved by\r\nRoux's fellow-workers in the field of causal morphology. As D. Barfurth\r\npoints out,[488] the years 1880-90 saw a general awakening of interest in\r\nexperimental morphology, and it is hard to say whether Roux's work was\r\ncause or consequence. \"There fall into this period,\" writes Barfurth,\r\n\"the experimental investigations by Born and Pflueger on the sexual\r\ndifference in frogs (1881), by Pflueger on the parthenogenetic\r\nsegmentation of Amphibian ova, on crossing among the Amphibia, and on\r\nother important subjects (1882). In the following year (1883) appeared\r\ntwo papers of fundamental importance, by E. Pflueger and W. Roux: Pflueger\r\npublishing his researches on 'the influence of gravity on\r\ncell-division,' Roux his experimental investigations on 'the time of the\r\ndetermination of the chief planes in the frog-embryo.'... In the same\r\nyear appeared A. Rauber's experimental studies 'on the influence of\r\ntemperature, atmospheric pressure, and various substances on the\r\ndevelopment of animal ova,' which have brought many similar works in\r\ntheir train. The following year (1884) saw a lively controversy on\r\nPflueger's gravity-experiments with animal eggs, in which took part\r\nPflueger, Born, Roux, O. Hertwig and others, and in this year appeared\r\nwork by Roux dealing with the experimental study of development, and in\r\nparticular giving the results of the first definitely localised\r\npricking-experiments on the frog's egg (in the _Schles. Gesell. f.\r\nvaterl. Kultur_, 15th Feb. 1884), also the important researches of M.\r\nNussbaum and Gruber (followed up later by Verworn, Hofer and Balbiani)\r\non Protozoa, and other experimental work\" (pp. xi.-xii.).\r\n\r\nIn 1888 appeared a famous paper by W. Roux,[489] in which he described how\r\nhe had succeeded in killing by means of a hot needle one of the two\r\nfirst blastomeres of the frog's egg, and how a half-embryo had developed\r\nfrom the uninjured cell. Some years before[490] he had enunciated, at\r\nabout the same time as Weismann, the view that development was brought\r\nabout by a qualitative division of the germ-plasm contained in the\r\nnucleus, and that the complicated process of karyokinetic or mitotic\r\ndivision of the nucleus was essentially adapted to this end. He\r\nconceived that development proceeded by a mosaic-like distribution of\r\npotencies to the segmentation-cells, that, for instance, the first\r\nsegmentation furrow separated off the material and potencies for the\r\nright half of the embryo from those for the left half. He had tried to\r\nshow experimentally that the first furrow in the frog's egg coincided\r\nwith the sagittal plane of the embryo,[491] and his later success in\r\nobtaining a half-embryo from one of the first two blastomeres seemed to\r\nestablish the \"mosaic theory\" conclusively.\r\n\r\nRoux's needle-experiment aroused much interest, especially as Weismann's\r\ntheory of heredity was then being keenly discussed. Chabry had published\r\nin 1887 some interesting results on the Ascidian egg,[492] which strongly\r\nsupported the Roux-Weismann theory. Considerable astonishment was\r\ntherefore caused by Driesch's announcement in 1891[493] that he had\r\nobtained complete larvae from single blastomeres of the sea-urchin's egg\r\nisolated at the two-celled stage. He followed this up in the next\r\nyear[493] by showing that whole embryos could be produced from one or more\r\nblastomeres isolated at the four-cell stage. Similar or even more\r\nstriking results were obtained by E. B. Wilson on _Amphioxus_,[494] and\r\nZoja on medusae.[495] Driesch succeeded also in disturbing the normal\r\ncourse and order of segmentation by compressing the eggs of the\r\nsea-urchin between glass plates, and yet obtained normal embryos.\r\nSimilar pressure-experiments were carried out on the frog by O.\r\nHertwig,[496] and on _Nereis_ by E. B. Wilson,[497] with analogous results.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 O. Schultze[498] showed that if the frog's egg is held between two\r\nplates and inverted at the two-celled stage there are formed two embryos\r\ninstead of one. In the same year T. H. Morgan[499] repeated Roux's\r\nfundamental experiment of destroying one of the two blastomeres, but\r\ninverted the egg immediately after the operation--a whole embryo of half\r\nsize resulted. A year or two later Herlitzka[500] found that if the first\r\ntwo blastomeres of the newt's egg were separated by constriction, two\r\nnormal embryos of rather more than half normal size were formed.\r\n\r\nThe main result of the first few years' work on the development of\r\nisolated blastomeres was to show that the mosaic theory was not strictly\r\ntrue, and that the hypothesis of a qualitative division of the nucleus\r\nwas on the whole negatived by the facts.\r\n\r\nEvidence soon accumulated that the cytoplasm of the egg stood for much\r\nin the differentiation of the embryo. A number of years previously Chun\r\nhad made the discovery that single blastomeres of the Ctenophore egg,\r\nisolated at the two-celled stage, gave half-embryos. This was in the\r\nmain confirmed by Driesch and Morgan in 1896,[501] and they made the\r\nfurther interesting discovery that the same defective larvae could be\r\nobtained by removing from the unsegmented egg a large amount of\r\ncytoplasm. Conclusive proof of the importance of the cytoplasm was\r\nobtained soon after by Crampton,[502] who removed the anucleate\r\n\"yolk-lobe\" from the egg of the mollusc _Ilyanassa_ at the two-celled\r\nstage, and obtained larvae which lacked a mesoblast. This result was\r\nbrilliantly confirmed and extended some years later by E. B. Wilson,[503]\r\nworking on the egg of _Dentalium_. He found that if the similar\r\nanucleate \"polar lobe\" of this form is removed at the two-celled stage,\r\ndeficient larvae are formed, in which the post-trochal region and the\r\napical organ are absent. He further showed that in the unsegmented but\r\nmature egg prelocalised cytoplasmic regions can be distinguished, which\r\nlater become separated from one another through the segmentation of the\r\negg. The segmentation-cells into which these cytoplasmic substances are\r\nthus segregated show a marked specificity of development, giving rise,\r\neven when isolated, to definite organs of the embryo. Wilson concluded\r\nthat the cytoplasm of the egg contains a number of specific\r\norgan-forming stuffs, which have a definite topographical arrangement in\r\nthe egg. Development is thus due in part to a qualitative division not\r\nof the nucleus but of the cytoplasm. Corroborative evidence of the\r\nexistence of cytoplasmic organ-forming stuffs has been supplied for\r\nseveral other species, _e.g._, _Patella_ (Wilson), _Cynthia_ (Conklin),\r\n_Cerebratulus_ (Zeleny), and _Echinus_ (Boveri).\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to recall that so long ago as 1874 W. His[504] put\r\nforward the theory that there exist in the blastoderm and even in the\r\negg prelocalised areas, which contain the formative material for each\r\norgan of the embryo, and from which the embryo is developed by a simple\r\nprocess of unequal growth.\r\n\r\nThe experimental study of form was prosecuted in many other directions\r\nbesides that of experimental embryology. The study of regeneration and\r\nof regulatory processes attracted many workers, among whom may be\r\nmentioned T. H. Morgan, C. M. Child, and H. Driesch. In an interesting\r\nseries of papers C. Herbst applied the principles of the physiology of\r\nstimulus to the interpretation of development.[505] The formative power of\r\nfunction was studied in Germany by Roux and his pupils, Fuld, O. Levy,\r\nSchepelmann and others, particularly by E. Babak. In France, F. Houssay\r\ninaugurated[506] an important series of memoirs by himself and his pupils\r\non \"dynamical morphology,\" the most important memoir being his own\r\nvaluable discussion of the functional significance of form in fishes.[507]\r\nThe principles of his dynamical morphology were first laid down in his\r\nbook _La Forme et la Vie_ (1900).\r\n\r\nThe famous experiments of Loeb, Delage and others on artificial\r\nparthenogenesis may also be mentioned, though their connection with\r\nmorphology is somewhat remote.\r\n\r\nThe period was characterised also by the lively discussion of first\r\nprinciples, in which Driesch took a leading part. Materialistic methods\r\nof interpretation were upheld by perhaps the majority of biologists, but\r\nvitalism found powerful support.\r\n\r\n    [464] See Carus's remark, referred to on p. 194, above.\r\n\r\n    [465] Roux, _Die Entwicklungsmechanik_, p. 26, Leipzig,\r\n    1905.\r\n\r\n    [466] T.

We have pointed out, too, the paramount role that function\r\nplays in Roux's theories of development and heredity, and we have\r\nbrought out the close kinship existing between his theory and that of\r\nLamarck. For Roux, as for Lamarck, the function creates the organ, and\r\nit is only after long generations that the organ appears before the\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that just about the time when Roux's papers were\r\nbeginning to appear a brilliant attempt was made by Samuel Butler to\r\nrevive and complete the Lamarckian doctrine.\r\n\r\nA man of singular freshness and openness of mind, combining in an\r\nextraordinary degree extreme intellectual subtlety with a childlike\r\nsimplicity of outlook, Butler was one of the most fascinating figures of\r\nthe 19th century. He was not a professional biologist, and much of his\r\nbiological work is, for that reason, imperfect. But he brought to bear\r\nupon the central problems of biology an unbiassed and powerful\r\nintelligence, and his attitude to these problems, just because it is\r\nthat of a cultivated layman, is singularly illuminating.\r\n\r\nHe was not well acquainted with biological literature; he seems to have\r\nhit upon the main ideas of his theory of life and habit in complete\r\nindependence of Lamarck, and only later to have become aware that\r\nLamarck had in a measure forestalled him. He puts this very beautifully\r\nin the following passage from his chief biological work _Life and Habit_\r\n(1877[508]):--\"I admit that when I began to write upon my subject I did\r\nnot seriously believe in it. I saw, as it were, a pebble upon the\r\nground, with a sheen that pleased me; taking it up, I turned it over and\r\nover for my amusement, and found it always grow brighter and brighter\r\nthe more I examined it. At length I became fascinated, and gave loose\r\nrein to self-illusion. The aspect of the world changed; the trifle which\r\nI had picked up idly had proved to be a talisman of inestimable value,\r\nand had opened a door through which I caught glimpses of a strange and\r\ninteresting transformation. Then came one who told me that the stone was\r\nnot mine, but that it had been dropped by Lamarck, to whom it belonged\r\nrightfully, but who had lost it; whereon I said I cared not who was the\r\nowner, if only I might use it and enjoy it. Now, therefore, having\r\npolished it with what art and care one who is no jeweller could bestow\r\nupon it, I return it, as best I may, to its possessor\" (p. 306). In one\r\nof his later works, however, Butler made up for his first neglect of his\r\npredecessors by giving what is undeniably the best account in English\r\nliterature of the work of Buffon, Lamarck, and Erasmus Darwin--in his\r\n_Evolution, Old and New_ (1879). Many of his facts he took from Charles\r\nDarwin, whose theory of natural selection he bitterly opposed, in the\r\ntwo books just mentioned and in _Unconscious Memory_ (1880) and _Luck or\r\nCunning_ (1887).\r\n\r\nButler's main thesis is that living things are active, intelligent\r\nagents, personally continuous with all their ancestors, possessing an\r\nintense but unconscious memory of all that their ancestors did and\r\nsuffered, and moving through habit from the spontaneity of striving to\r\nthe automatism of remembrance.\r\n\r\nThe primary cause of all variation in structure is the active response\r\nof the organism to needs experienced by it, and the indispensable link\r\nbetween the outer world and the creature itself is that same \"sense of\r\nneed\" upon which Lamarck insisted. \"According to Lamarck, genera and\r\nspecies have been evolved, in the main, by exactly the same process as\r\nthat by which human inventions and civilisations are now progressing;\r\nand this involves that intelligence, ingenuity, heroism, and all the\r\nelements of romance, should have had the main share in the development\r\nof every herb and living creature around us\" (_Life and Habit_, p. 253).\r\nVariations are indubitably the raw material of evolution--\"The question\r\nis as to the origin and character of these variations. We say they\r\nmainly originate in a creature through a sense of its needs, and vary\r\nthrough the varying surroundings which will cause those needs to vary,\r\nand through the opening-up of new desires in many creatures, as the\r\nconsequence of the gratification of old ones; they depend greatly on\r\ndifferences of individual capacity and temperament; they are\r\ncommunicated, and in the course of time transmitted, as what we call\r\nhereditary habits or structures, though these are only, in truth,\r\nintense and epitomised memories of how certain creatures liked to deal\r\nwith protoplasm\" (p. 267).\r\n\r\nButler's theory then is essentially a bold and enlightened Lamarckism,\r\ncompleted and rounded off by the conception that heredity too is a\r\npsychological process, of the same nature as memory.\r\n\r\nIn seeking to establish a close analogy between memory and heredity\r\nButler starts out from the fact of common experience, that actions which\r\non their first performance require the conscious exercise of will and\r\nintelligence, and are then carried out with difficulty and hesitation,\r\ngradually through long-continued practice come to be performed easily\r\nand automatically, without the conscious exercise of intelligence or\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nHe tries to show that this is a general law--that knowledge and will\r\nbecome intense and perfect only when through long-continued exercise\r\nthey become automatic and unconscious--and he applies this conception to\r\nthe elucidation of development.\r\n\r\nDevelopmental processes, especially the early ones (of Roux's first\r\nstage) are automatic and unconscious, and yet imply the possession by\r\nthe embryo of a wonderfully perfect knowledge of the processes to be\r\ngone through, and an assured power of will and judgment. Is it\r\nconceivable, says Butler, that the embryo can do all these things\r\nwithout knowing how to do them, and without having done them before?\r\n\"Shall we say ... that a baby of a day old sucks (which involves the\r\nwhole principle of the pump, and hence a profound practical knowledge of\r\nthe laws of pneumatics and hydrostatics), digests, oxygenises its blood\r\n(millions of years before Sir Humphrey Davy discovered oxygen), sees and\r\nhears--all most difficult and complicated operations, involving a\r\nknowledge of the facts concerning optics and acoustics, compared with\r\nwhich the discoveries of Newton sink into utter insignificance? Shall we\r\nsay that a baby can do all these things at once, doing them so well and\r\nso regularly, without being even able to direct its attention to them,\r\nand without mistake, and at the same time not know how to do them, and\r\nnever have done them before?\" (p. 54). Assuredly not.\r\n\r\nThe only possible explanation is that the embryo's ancestors have done\r\nthese things so often, throughout so many millions of generations, that\r\nthe embryo's knowledge of how to do them has become unconscious and\r\nautomatic by reason of this age-long practice. This implies that there\r\nis in a very real sense actual personal continuity between the embryo\r\nand all its ancestors, so that their experiences are his, their memory\r\nalso his. \"We must suppose the continuity of life and sameness between\r\nliving beings, whether plants or animals, to be far closer than we have\r\nhitherto believed; so that the experience of one person is not enjoyed\r\nby his successor, so much as that the successor is _bona fide_ but a\r\npart of the life of his progenitor, imbued with all his memories,\r\nprofiting by all his experiences--which are, in fact, his own--and only\r\nunconscious of the extent of his own memories and experiences owing to\r\ntheir vastness and already infinite repetitions\" (p. 50). It is very\r\nsuggestive in this connection, he continues--\"I. That we are _most\r\nconscious of, and have most control over_, such habits as speech, the\r\nupright position, the arts and sciences, which are acquisitions peculiar\r\nto the human race, always acquired after birth, and not common to\r\nourselves and any ancestor who had not become entirely human.\r\n\r\n\"II. That we are _less conscious of, and have less control over_, eating\r\nand drinking, swallowing, breathing, seeing and hearing, which were\r\nacquisitions of our prehuman ancestry, and for which we had provided\r\nourselves with all the necessary apparatus before we saw light, but\r\nwhich are, geologically speaking, recent, or comparatively recent.\r\n\r\n\"III. That we are _most unconscious of, and have least control over_,\r\nour digestion and circulation, which belonged even to our invertebrate\r\nancestry, and which are habits, geologically speaking, of extreme\r\nantiquity.... Does it not seem as though the older and more confirmed\r\nthe habit, the more unquestioning the act of volition, till, in the case\r\nof the oldest habits, the practice of succeeding existences has so\r\nformulated the procedure, that, on being once committed to such and such\r\na line beyond a certain point, the subsequent course is so clear as to\r\nbe open to no further doubt, to admit of no alternative, till the very\r\npower of questioning is gone, and even the consciousness of volition\"\r\n(pp. 51-2).\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis then, that heredity and development are due to\r\nunconscious memory, finds much to support it--\"the self-development of\r\neach new life in succeeding generations--the various stages through\r\nwhich it passes (as it would appear, at first sight, without rhyme or\r\nreason), the manner in which it prepares structures of the most\r\nsurpassing intricacy and delicacy, for which it has no use at the time\r\nwhen it prepares them, and the many elaborate instincts which it\r\nexhibits immediately on, and indeed before, birth--all point in the\r\ndirection of habit and memory, as the only causes which could produce\r\nthem\" (p. 125). The hypothesis explains, for instance, the fact of\r\nrecapitulation:--\"Why should the embryo of any animal go through so many\r\nstages--embryological allusions to forefathers of a widely different\r\ntype? And why, again, should the germs of the same kind of creature\r\nalways go through the same stages? If the germ of any animal now living\r\nis, in its simplest state, but part of the personal identity of one of\r\nthe original germs of all life whatsoever, and hence, if any now living\r\norganism must be considered without quibble as being itself millions of\r\nyears old, and as imbued with an intense though unconscious memory of\r\nall that it has done sufficiently often to have made a permanent\r\nimpression; if this be so, we can answer the above questions perfectly\r\nwell. The creature goes through so many intermediate stages between its\r\nearliest state as life at all, and its latest development, for the\r\nsimplest of all reasons, namely, because this is the road by which it\r\nhas always hitherto travelled to its present differentiation; this is\r\nthe road it knows, and into every turn and up or down of which it has\r\nbeen guided by the force of circumstances and the balance of\r\nconsiderations\" (pp. 125-6).\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis explains also the way in which the orderly succession of\r\nstages in embryogeny is brought about, for we can readily understand\r\nthat the embryo will not remember any stage until it has passed through\r\nthe stage immediately preceding it. \"Each step of normal development\r\nwill lead the impregnated ovum up to, and remind it of, its next\r\nordinary course of action, in the same way as we, when we recite a\r\nwell-known passage, are led up to each successive sentence by the\r\nsentence which has immediately preceded it.... Though the ovum\r\nimmediately after impregnation is instinct with all the memories of both\r\nparents, not one of these memories can normally become active till both\r\nthe ovum itself and its surroundings are sufficiently like what they\r\nrespectively were, when the occurrence now to be remembered last took\r\nplace. The memory will then immediately return, and the creature will do\r\nas it did on the last occasion that it was in like case as now. This\r\nensures that similarity of order shall be preserved in all the stages of\r\ndevelopment in successive generations\" (pp. 297-8).\r\n\r\nAbnormal conditions of development will cause the embryo to pause and\r\nhesitate, as if at a loss what to do, having no ancestral experience to\r\nguide it. Abnormalities of development represent the embryo's attempt to\r\nmake the best of an unexpected situation. Or, as Butler puts it, \"When\r\n... events are happening to it which, if it has the kind of memory we\r\nare attributing to it, would baffle that memory, or which have rarely or\r\nnever been included in the category of its recollections, _it acts\r\nprecisely as a creature acts_ _when its recollection is disturbed, or\r\nwhen it is required to do something which it has never done before_\" (p.\r\n132). \"It is certainly noteworthy that the embryo is never at a loss,\r\nunless something happens to it which has not usually happened to its\r\nforefathers, and which in the nature of things it cannot remember\" (p.\r\n132).\r\n\r\nButler's teleological conception of organic evolution was of course\r\ncompletely antagonistic to the naturalistic conceptions current in his\r\ntime. In one of his later books he repeats Paley's arguments in favour\r\nof design, and to the question, \"Where, then, is your designer of beasts\r\nand birds, of fishes, and of plants?\" he replies: \"Our answer is simple\r\nenough; it is that we can and do point to a living tangible person with\r\nflesh, blood, eyes, nose, ears, organs, senses, dimensions, who did of\r\nhis own cunning, after infinite proof of every kind of hazard and\r\nexperiment, scheme out and fashion each organ of the human body. This is\r\nthe person whom we claim as the designer and artificer of that body, and\r\nhe is the one of all others the best fitted for the task by his\r\nantecedents, and his practical knowledge of the requirements of the\r\ncase--for he is man himself. Not man, the individual of any given\r\ngeneration, but man in the entirety of his existence from the dawn of\r\nlife onwards to the present moment\" (_Evolution, Old and New_, p. 30,\r\n1879).\r\n\r\nButler's theory of life and habit remained only a sketch, and he was\r\nperhaps not fully aware of its philosophical implications. Since\r\nButler's time, a new complexion has been put upon biological philosophy\r\nby the profound speculations of Bergson.\r\n\r\nBut it is not impossible that the future development of biological\r\nthought will follow some such lines as those which he tentatively laid\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nButler was not the first to suggest that there is a close connection\r\nbetween heredity and memory--it is a thought likely to occur to any\r\nunprejudiced thinker. The first enunciation of it which attracted\r\ngeneral attention was that contained in Hering's famous lecture \"On\r\nMemory as a general Function of organised Matter.\"[509] Butler was not\r\naware of Hering's work when he published his _Life and Habit_, but in\r\n_Unconscious Memory_ (1880) he gave full credit to Hering as the first\r\ndiscoverer, and supplied an admirable translation of Hering's lecture.\r\nAs far as the assimilation of heredity to memory is concerned Hering and\r\nButler have much in common, but Hering did not share Butler's Lamarckian\r\nand vitalistic views, preferring to hold fast, for the practical\r\npurposes of physiology at all events, to the general accepted theory of\r\nthe parallelism between psychical and physical processes. He was\r\ninclined to regard memory in the ordinary sense as a function of the\r\nbrain, and memory in general as a function of all organised matter.\r\nSpeaking of the psychical life, he says, \"Thus the cause which produces\r\nthe unity of all single phenomena of consciousness must be looked for in\r\nunconscious life. As we know nothing of this except what we learn from\r\nour investigations of matter, and since in a purely empirical\r\nconsideration, matter and the unconscious must be regarded as identical,\r\nthe physiologist may justly define memory in a wider sense to be a\r\nfaculty of the brain, the results of which to a great extent belong to\r\nboth consciousness and unconsciousness.\"[510] Hering's views were\r\nsupported by Haeckel.[511]\r\n\r\nIn 1893 an American, H. F. Orr,[512] tried to work out a theory of\r\ndevelopment and heredity based upon the fundamental idea \"that the\r\nproperty which is the basis of bodily development in organisms is the\r\nsame property which we recognise as the basis of psychic activity and\r\npsychic development.\" He tried also to explain the recapitulation of\r\nphylogeny by ontogeny as due to habit.\r\n\r\nThe neo-Lamarckian school of American palaeontologists were also in\r\nsympathy with the memory idea, and this was expressed most clearly\r\nperhaps by Cope.[513]\r\n\r\nIn 1904 appeared the work on this subject which has attracted the most\r\nattention--R. Semon's _Die Mneme_.[514] This was an elaborate treatment of\r\nthe question from the materialistic point of view, the main assumption\r\nof Semon's theory being that the action of a stimulus upon the organism\r\nleaves a more or less permanent material trace or \"engramm,\" of such a\r\nnature as to modify the subsequent action of the organism.\r\n\r\nApplied to the explanation of heredity and development, Semon's theory\r\ncomes to very much the same as Weismann's, with engramms substituted for\r\ndeterminants, but it has the great advantage of allowing for the\r\ntransmission of acquired characters. The application of the concept of\r\nstimulus is valuable and suggestive, but it seems to us that the memory\r\ntheory of heredity can be properly utilised only by adopting a frankly\r\nLamarckian and vitalistic standpoint, and this standpoint Semon\r\nexpressly combats. As Ward[515] points out in his illuminating lecture on\r\nheredity and memory--\"Records or memoranda alone are not memory, for\r\nthey presuppose it. _They_ may consist of physical traces, but memory,\r\neven when called 'unconscious,' suggests mind; for, as we have seen, the\r\nautomatic character implied by this term 'unconscious' presupposes\r\nforegone experience.... The mnemic theory then, if it is to be worth\r\nanything, seems to me clearly to require not merely physical records or\r\n'engrams,' but living experience or tradition. The mnemic theory will\r\nwork for those who can accept a monadistic or pampsychist interpretation\r\nof the beings that make up the world, who believe with Spinoza and\r\nLeibniz that 'all individual things are animated albeit in divers\r\ndegree'\" (pp. 55-6).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best and most ingenious treatment of memory and heredity\r\nfrom a physical standpoint is that offered by E. Rignano in his book,\r\n_Sur la transmissibilite des caracteres acquis_.[516] Rignano seeks to\r\nconstruct a physico-chemical \"model\" which will explain both heredity\r\nand memory.\r\n\r\nHis system, which is based more firmly upon the facts of experimental\r\nembryology than Semon's, postulates the existence of \"specific nervous\r\naccumulators.\" The essential hypothesis set up is that every functional\r\nstimulus is transformed into specific vital energy, and deposits in the\r\nnucleus of the cell a specific substance which is capable of\r\ndischarging, in an inverse direction, the nervous current which has\r\nformed it, as soon as the dynamical equilibrium of the organism is\r\nrestored to the state in which it was when the original stimulus acted\r\nupon it. These specific nuclear substances, different for each cell, are\r\naccumulated also in the nuclei of the germinal substance, constituting\r\nwhat Rignano calls the central zone of development. That is to say, each\r\nfunctional adaptation changes slightly the dynamical equilibrium of the\r\norganism, and this change in the system of distribution of the nervous\r\ncurrents leads to the deposit in the central zone of development of a\r\nnew specific substance. In the development of the next individual this\r\nnew specific element enters into activity, and reproduces the nervous\r\ncurrent which has formed it, as soon as the organism reaches the same\r\nconditions of dynamical equilibrium as those obtaining when the stimulus\r\nacted on the parent.\r\n\r\nDevelopment can thus be regarded as consisting of a number of stages, at\r\neach of which new specific elements enter automatically into play and\r\nlead the embryo from that stage to the stage succeeding. The germinal\r\nsubstance on this theory of Rignano's is to be regarded as being\r\ncomposed of a large number of specific elements, originally formed as a\r\nresult of each new functional adaptation, but now forming part of the\r\nhereditary equipment.\r\n\r\nThe theory represents an advance upon the more static conceptions of\r\nSemon. It owes much to Roux's influence.\r\n\r\nIn this country, the mnemic theories have been championed particularly\r\nby M. Hartog[517] and Sir Francis Darwin.[518]\r\n\r\n    [508] The quotations are taken from the 1910 reprint,\r\n    London, Fifield.\r\n\r\n    [509] _Ueber das Gedaechtnis als eine allgemeine Funktion\r\n    der organisierten Materie_, Wien, 1870.\r\n\r\n    [510] Eng. trans, in E.

It is difficult\r\nfor those in the stream to see where the current is carrying them: the\r\ntendencies of the present will only become clear some twenty years in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nI propose, therefore, in this concluding chapter to deal only with\r\ncertain characteristics of modern work on the problems of form which\r\nseem to me to be derived directly from the older classical tradition of\r\nCuvier and von Baer.\r\n\r\nThe present time is essentially one of transition. Complete uncertainty\r\nreigns as to the main principles of biology. Many of us think that the\r\nmaterialistic and simplicist method has proved a complete failure, and\r\nthat the time has come to strike out on entirely different lines. Just\r\nin what direction the new biology will grow out is hard to see at\r\npresent, so many divergent beginnings have been made--the materialistic\r\nvitalism of Driesch, the profound intuitionalism of Bergson, the\r\npsychological biology of Delpino, France, Pauly, A. Wagner and W.\r\nMackenzie. But if any of these are destined to give the future direction\r\nto biology, they will in a measure only be bringing biology back to its\r\npre-materialistic tradition, the tradition of Aristotle, Cuvier, von\r\nBaer and J. Mueller. It may well be that the intransigent materialism of\r\nthe 19th century is merely an episode, an aberration rather, in the\r\nhistory of biology--an aberration brought about by the over-rapid\r\ndevelopment of a materialistic and luxurious civilisation, in which\r\nman's material means have outrun his mental and moral growth.\r\n\r\nTwo movements seem significant in the morphology of the last decade or\r\nso of the 19th century--first, the experimental study of form, and\r\nsecond, the criticism of the concepts or prejudices of evolutionary\r\nmorphology.\r\n\r\nThe period was characterised also by the great interest taken in\r\ncytology, following upon the pioneer work of Hertwig, van Beneden and\r\nothers on the behaviour of the nuclei in fertilisation and\r\nmaturation.[519] This line of work gained added importance in connection\r\nwith contemporary research and speculation on the nature of hereditary\r\ntransmission, and it has in quite recent years received an additional\r\nstimulus from the re-discovery of Mendelian inheritance. Its importance,\r\nhowever, seems to lie rather in its possible relation to the problems of\r\nheredity than in any meaning it may have for the problems of form. More\r\nsignificant is the revolt against the cell-theory started by Sedgwick[520]\r\nand Whitman,[521] on the ground that the organism is something more than\r\nan aggregation of discrete, self-centred cells.\r\n\r\nThe experimental work on the causes of the production and restoration of\r\nform infused new life into morphology. It opened men's eyes to the fact\r\nthat the developing organism is very much a living, active, responsive\r\nthing, quite capable of relinquishing at need the beaten track of normal\r\ndevelopment which its ancestors have followed for countless generations,\r\nin order to meet emergencies with an immediate and purposive reaction.\r\nIt was cases of this kind, cases of active regulation in development and\r\nregeneration, that led men like G. Wolff and H. Driesch to cast off the\r\nbonds of dogmatic Darwinism and declare boldly for vitalism and\r\nteleology.\r\n\r\nThere was the famous case of the regeneration of the lens in Amphibia\r\nfrom the edge of the iris--an entirely novel mode of origin, not\r\noccurring in ontogeny. The fact seems to have been discovered first by\r\nColucci in 1891, and independently by G. Wolff in 1895.[522] The\r\nexperiment was later repeated and confirmed by Fischel and other\r\nworkers. Wolff drew from this and other facts the conclusion that the\r\norganism possesses a faculty of \"primary purposiveness\" which cannot\r\nhave arisen through natural selection.[523] And, as is well known, Driesch\r\nderived one of his most powerful arguments in favour of vitalism from\r\nthe extraordinary regenerative processes shown by _Tubularia_ and\r\n_Clavellina_ in the course of which the organism actually demolishes and\r\nrebuilds a part or the whole of its structure. But under the influence\r\nof physiologists like Loeb many workers held fast to materialistic\r\nmethods and conceptions.\r\n\r\nThe great variety of regulative response of which the organism showed\r\nitself capable made it very difficult for the morphologist to uphold the\r\ngeneralisations which he had drawn from the facts of normal undisturbed\r\ndevelopment. The germ-layer theory was found inadequate to the new\r\nfacts, and many reverted to the older criterion of homology based on\r\ndestiny rather than origin. The trend of opinion was to reject the\r\nontogenetic criterion of homology, and to refuse any morphological or\r\nphylogenetic value to the germ-layers.[524]\r\n\r\nThe biogenetic law came more and more into disfavour, as the developing\r\norganism more and more showed itself to be capable of throwing off the\r\ndead-weight of the past, and working out its own salvation upon original\r\nand individual lines.[525] A. Giard in particular called attention to a\r\nremarkable group of facts which went to show that embryos or larvae of\r\nthe same or closely allied species might develop in most dissimilar ways\r\naccording to the conditions in which they found themselves.[526] His\r\nclassical case of \"poecilogeny\" was that of the shrimp _Palaemonetes\r\nvarians_, the fresh-water form of which develops in an entirely\r\ndifferent way from the salt-water form.\r\n\r\nExperimental workers indeed were inclined to rule the law out of\r\naccount, to disregard completely the historical element in development,\r\nand this was perhaps the chief weakness of the neo-vitalist systems\r\nwhich took their origin in this experimental work.\r\n\r\nFrom the side also of descriptive morphology the biogenetic law\r\nunderwent a critical revision. It was studied as a fact of embryology\r\nand without phylogenetic bias by men like Oppel, Keibel, Mehnert, O.\r\nHertwig and Vialleton,[527] and they arrived at a critical estimate of it\r\nvery similar to that of von Baer.\r\n\r\nTheoretical objections to the biogenetic law had been raised from time\r\nto time by many embryologists, but the positive testing of it by the\r\ncomparison of embryos in respect of the degree of development of their\r\ndifferent organs starts with Oppel's work of 1891.[528] He studied a large\r\nnumber of embryos of different species at different stages of their\r\ndevelopment, and determined the relative time of appearance of the\r\nprincipal organs and their relative size. His results are summarised in\r\ntabular form and have reference to all the more important organs. He was\r\nled to ascribe a certain validity to the biogenetic law, but he drew\r\nparticular attention to the very considerable anomalies in the time of\r\nappearance which are shown by many organs, anomalies which had been\r\nclassed by Haeckel under the name of heterochronies.\r\n\r\nOppel's main conclusions were as follows:--\"There are found in the\r\ndevelopmental stages of different Vertebrates 'similar ontogenetic\r\nseries,' that is to say, Vertebrates show at definite stages\r\nsimilarities with one another in the degree of development of the\r\ndifferent organs. Early stages resemble one another, so also do later\r\nstages; equivalent stages of closely allied species resemble one\r\nanother, and older stages of lower animals resemble younger stages of\r\nhigher animals; young stages are more alike than old stages.... The\r\ndifferences which these similar series show (for which reason they\r\ncannot be regarded as identical) may be designated as temporal\r\ndisturbances in the degree of development of the separate organs or\r\norgan-systems. Some organs show very considerable temporal dislocations,\r\nothers a moderate amount, others again an inconsiderable amount. Among\r\nthe developmental stages of various higher animals can be found some\r\nwhich correspond to the ancestral forms and also to the lower types\r\nwhich resemble these ancestral forms. On the basis of the tabulated data\r\nhere given there can be distinguished with certainty in the ontogeny of\r\nAmniotes a pro-fish stage, a fish-stage, a land-animal stage, a\r\npro-amniote stage, and following on these a fully developed reptile,\r\nbird or mammal stage.\"[529]\r\n\r\nOppel's methods were employed by Keibel[530] in his investigations on the\r\ndevelopment of the pig, which formed the model for the well-known series\r\nof _Normentafeln_ of the ontogeny of Vertebrates which were issued in\r\nlater years under Keibel's editorship. Keibel was more critical of the\r\nbiogenetic law than Oppel, and he held that the ancestral stages\r\ndistinguished by Oppel could not be satisfactorily established. He\r\nsuggested an interesting explanation of heterochrony in development,\r\naccording to which the premature or retarded appearance of organs in\r\nontogeny stands in close relation with the time of their entering upon\r\nfunctional activity. Thus in many mammals the mesodermal part of the\r\nallantois often appears long before the endodermal part, though this is\r\nphylogenetically older. This Keibel ascribes to the fact that the\r\nendodermal part is almost functionless. \"One can directly affirm,\" he\r\nwrites, \"that the time of appearance of an organ depends in an eminent\r\ndegree upon the time when it has to enter upon functional activity. This\r\nmoment is naturally dependent upon the external conditions. Among the\r\nhighest Vertebrates, the mammals, the traces of phylogeny shown in\r\nontogeny are to a great extent obliterated through the adaptation of\r\nontogeny to the external conditions, and through the modifications which\r\nthe germs of more highly organised animals necessarily exhibit from the\r\nvery beginning as compared with germs which do not reach such a high\r\nlevel of development\" (p. 754, 1897).\r\n\r\nStudy of individual variation in the time of appearance of the organs in\r\nembryos of the same species was prosecuted with interesting results by\r\nBonnet,[531] Mehnert,[532] and Fischel.[533] Fischel found that variability\r\nwas greatest among the younger embryos, and became progressively less in\r\nlater stages. Like von Baer (_supra_, p. 114) he inferred that\r\nregulatory processes were at work during development which brought\r\ndivergent organs back to the normal and enabled them to play their part\r\nas correlated members of a functional whole.\r\n\r\nImportant theoretical views were developed by Mehnert[534] in a series of\r\npublications appearing from 1891 to 1898. Like Keibel, Mehnert\r\nemphasised the importance of function in determining the late or early\r\nappearance of organs, but he conceived the influence of function to be\r\nexerted not only in ontogeny, but also throughout the whole course of\r\nphylogeny, by reason of the transmission to descendants of the effects\r\nof functioning in the individual life.\r\n\r\nIn his paper of 1897 Mehnert details the results of an extensive\r\nexamination of the development of the extremities throughout the Amniote\r\nseries. He finds that in all cases a pentadactylate rudiment is formed,\r\neven in those forms in which only a few of the elements of the hand or\r\nfoot come to full development. But whereas in forms with a normally\r\ndeveloped hand, _e.g._ the tortoise and man, all the digits develop and\r\ndifferentiate at about the same rate, in forms which have in the adult\r\nreduced digits, _e.g._ the ostrich and the pig, these vestigial digits\r\nundergo a very slow and incomplete differentiation, while the others\r\ndevelop rapidly and completely. He draws a general distinction between\r\norgans that are phylogenetically progressive and such as are\r\nphylogenetically regressive, and seeks to prove that progressive organs\r\nshow an ontogenetic acceleration and regressive organs a retardation.[535]\r\nThe acceleration or retardation affects not only the mass-growth of the\r\norgans, but also their histological differentiation.\r\n\r\nNow between progression and functioning and between regression and\r\nfunctional atrophy there is obviously a close connection. Loss of\r\nfunction is well known to be one of the chief causes of the degeneration\r\nof organs in the individual life, and on the other hand, as Roux has\r\npointed out, all post-embryonic development is ruled and guided by\r\nfunctioning. It is thus in the long run functioning that brings about\r\nphylogenetic progression, absence of functional activity that causes\r\nphylogenetic regression. This comes about through the transmission of\r\nacquired functional characters, a transmission which Mehnert conceives\r\nto be extraordinarily accurate and complete.\r\n\r\nIn general Mehnert adopts the functional standpoint of Cuvier, von Baer,\r\nand Roux. His considered judgment as to the phylogenetic value of the\r\nbiogenetic law closely resembles that formed by von Baer, for he admits\r\nrecapitulation only as regards the single organs, not as regards the\r\norganism as a whole. He has, however, much more sympathy with the law\r\nthan either Keibel or Oppel, though he agrees that it cannot be used for\r\nthe construction of ancestral trees. But he ascribes to it as a fact of\r\ndevelopment considerable importance. The following passage gives a good\r\nsummary of his view as to the scope and validity of the law. \"The\r\nbiogenetic law has not been shaken by the attacks of its opponents. The\r\nassertion is still true that individual organogenesis is exclusively\r\ndependent on phylogeny. But we must not expect to find that all the\r\nstages in the development of the separate organs, which coexisted in any\r\nmember of the phylogenetic series, appear _at the same time_ in the\r\nindividual ontogeny of the descendants, because each organ possesses its\r\nown specific rate of development. In this way it comes about naturally\r\nthat organs which become differentiated rapidly, as, for example, the\r\nmedullary tube, as a rule dominate earlier periods of ontogeny than do\r\nthe organs of locomotion. For the same reason the cerebral hemispheres\r\nof man are almost as large in youth as in maturity. The picture which an\r\nembryo gives is not a repetition in detail of one and the same\r\nphylogenetic stage; it consists rather of an assemblage of organs, some\r\nof which are at a phyletically early stage of development, while others\r\nare at a phyletically older stage.\"[536]\r\n\r\nA different line of attack was that adopted by O. Hertwig in a series of\r\npapers, which contain also what is perhaps the best critical estimate of\r\nthe present position and value of descriptive morphology.[537]\r\n\r\nIt had not escaped the notice of many previous observers that quite\r\nearly embryos not infrequently show specific characters even before the\r\ncharacters proper to their class, order and genus are developed--in\r\ndirect contradiction of the law of von Baer. Thus L. Agassiz[538] had\r\nremarked in 1859 that specific characteristics were often developed\r\nprecociously. \"The Snapping Turtle, for instance, exhibits its small\r\ncrosslike sternum, its long tail, its ferocious habits, even before it\r\nleaves the egg, before it breathes through lungs, before its derm is\r\nossified to form a bony shield, etc.; nay, it snaps with its gaping jaws\r\nat anything brought near, when it is still surrounded by its amnion and\r\nallantois, and its yolk still exceeds in bulk its whole body\" (p. 269).\r\n\r\nWilhelm His,[539] in the course of an acute and damaging criticism of the\r\nbiogenetic law as enunciated by Haeckel, showed clearly that by careful\r\nexamination the very earliest embryos of a whole series of Vertebrates\r\ncould be distinguished with certainty from one another. \"An identity in\r\nexternal form of different animal embryos, despite the common\r\naffirmation to the contrary, does not exist. Even at early stages in\r\ntheir development embryos possess the characters of their class and\r\norder, nay, we can hardly doubt, of their species and sex, and even\r\ntheir individual characteristics\" (201).\r\n\r\nThis specificity of embryos was affirmed with even greater confidence by\r\nSedgwick in a paper critical of von Baer's law.[540] He wrote:--\"If v.\r\nBaer's law has any meaning at all, surely it must imply that animals so\r\nclosely allied as the fowl and duck would be indistinguishable in the\r\nearly stages of development; and that in two species so closely similar\r\nthat I was long in doubt whether they were distinct species, viz.,\r\n_Peripatus capensis_ and _Balfouri_, it would be useless to look for\r\nembryonic differences; yet I can distinguish a fowl and a duck embryo on\r\nthe second day by the inspection of a single transverse section through\r\nthe trunk, and it was the embryonic differences between the Peripatuses\r\nwhich led me to establish without hesitation the two separate\r\nspecies.... I need only say ... that a species is distinct and\r\ndistinguishable from its allies from the very earliest stages all\r\nthrough the development, although these embryonic differences do not\r\nnecessarily implicate the same organs as do the adult differences\" (p.\r\n39).\r\n\r\nHertwig interprets this fact of the specific distinctness of closely\r\nallied embryos in the light of the preformistic conception of heredity.\r\nAccording to this view the whole adult organisation is represented in\r\nthe structure of the germ-plasm contained in the fertilised ovum, from\r\nwhich it follows that the ova of two different species, and also their\r\nembryos at every stage of development, must be as distinct from one\r\nanother as are the adults themselves, even though the differences may\r\nnot be so obvious. If this be the case there can be no real\r\nrecapitulation in ontogeny of the phylogeny of the race, for the\r\negg-cell represents not the first term in phylogeny, but the last. The\r\negg-cell _is_ the organism in an undeveloped state; it has a vastly more\r\ncomplicated structure than was possessed by the primordial cell from\r\nwhich its race has sprung, and it can in no way be considered the\r\nequivalent of this ancestral cell.\r\n\r\nHertwig puts this vividly when he says that \"the hen's egg is no more\r\nthe equivalent of the first link in the phylogenetic chain than is the\r\nhen itself\" (p. 160, 1906, b).\r\n\r\nIf ontogeny is not a recapitulation of phylogeny, how is it that the\r\nearly embryonic stages are so alike, even in animals of widely different\r\norganisation? Hertwig's answer to this is very interesting. He takes the\r\nview that many of the processes characterising early embryonic\r\ndevelopment are the means necessarily adopted for attaining certain\r\nends. Such are the processes of segmentation, the formation of a\r\nblastula, of cell-layers, of medullary folds where the nervous system is\r\na closed tube, the formation of the notochord as a necessary condition\r\nof the development of the vertebral column, and so on. \"Looked at from\r\nthis standpoint it cannot surprise us that in all animal phyla the\r\nearliest embryonic processes take place in similar fashion, so that we\r\nobserve the occurrence both in Vertebrates and Invertebrates of a\r\nsegmentation-process, a morula-stage, a blastula and a gastrula. If now\r\nthese developmental processes do not depend on chance, but, on the\r\ncontrary, are rooted in the nature of the animal cell itself, we have no\r\nreason for inferring from the recurrence of a similar\r\nsegmentation-process, morula, blastula, and gastrula in all classes of\r\nthe animal kingdom the common descent of all animals from one\r\nblastula-like or gastrula-like ancestral form. We recognise rather in\r\nthe successive early stages of animal development only the manifestation\r\nof special laws, by which the shaping of animal forms (as distinct from\r\nplant forms) is brought about\" (p. 178, 1906, b).\r\n\r\n\"The principal reason why certain stages recur in ontogeny with such\r\nconstancy and always in essentially the same manner is that they provide\r\nunder all circumstances the necessary pre-conditions through which alone\r\nthe later and higher stages of ontogeny can be realised. The unicellular\r\norganism can by its very nature transform itself into a multicellular\r\norganism only by the method of cell-division. Hence, in all Metazoa,\r\nontogeny must start with a segmentation-process, and a similar statement\r\ncould be made with regard to all the later stages\" (p. 57, 1906, a).\r\n\r\nSimilarities in early development are therefore no evidence of common\r\ndescent, and in the same way the resemblances of adult animals, subsumed\r\nunder the concepts of homology and the unity of plan, are not\r\nnecessarily due to community of descent, but may also be brought about\r\nby the similarity or identity of the laws which govern the evolution of\r\nthese animals. In the absence, therefore, of positive evidence as to the\r\nactual lines of descent (to be obtained only from palaeontology),\r\nhomological resemblance cannot be taken as proof of blood relationship,\r\nfor homology is a wider concept than homogeny. The only valid definition\r\nof homology is that adopted in pre-evolutionary days, when those organs\r\nwere considered homologous \"which agree up to a certain point in\r\nstructure and composition, in position, arrangement, and relation to the\r\nneighbouring organs, and accordingly possess identical functions and\r\nuses in the organism\" (p. 151, 1906, b).\r\n\r\nThe concept of homology has thus a value quite independent of any\r\nevolutionary interpretation which may be superadded to it. \"Homology is\r\na mental concept obtained by comparison, which under all circumstances\r\nretains its validity, whether the homology finds its explanation in\r\ncommon descent or in the common laws that rule organic development\" (p.\r\n151, 1906, b). As A. Braun long ago pointed out, \"It is not descent\r\nwhich decides in matters of morphology, but, on the contrary, morphology\r\nwhich has to decide as to the possibility of descent.\"[541]\r\n\r\nHertwig, in a word, reverts to the pre-evolutionary conception of\r\nhomology. \"We see in homology,\" he writes, \"only the expression of\r\nregularities (_Gesetzmaessigkeiten_) in the organisation of the animals\r\nshowing it, and we regard the question, how far this homology can be\r\nexplained by common descent and how far by other principles, as for the\r\npresent an open one, requiring for its solution investigations specially\r\ndirected towards its elucidation\" (p. 179, 1906, b).\r\n\r\nHolding, as he does, that no definite conclusions can be drawn from the\r\nfacts of comparative anatomy and embryology as to the probable lines of\r\ndescent of the animal kingdom, Hertwig accords very little value to\r\nphylogenetic speculation. It is, he admits, quite probable that the\r\narchetype of a class represents in a general sort of way the ancestral\r\nform, but this does not, in his opinion, justify us in assuming that\r\nsuch generalised types ever existed and gave origin to the present-day\r\nforms. \"It is not legitimate to picture to ourselves the ancestral forms\r\nof the more highly organised animals in the guise of the lower animals\r\nof the present day--and that is just what we do when we speak of\r\nProselachia, Proamphibia and Proreptilia\" (p. 155, 1906, b).\r\n\r\nHe rejects on the same general grounds the evolutionary dogma of\r\nmonophyletic or almost monophyletic descent, and admits with Koelliker,\r\nvon Baer, Wigand, Naegeli and others that evolution may quite well have\r\nstarted many times and from many different primordial cells.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed a great similarity between the views developed by O.\r\nHertwig and those held by the older critics of Darwinism--von Baer,\r\nKoelliker, Wigand, E. von Hartmann and others. It is true the\r\nphilosophical standpoint is on the whole different, for while many of\r\nthat older generation were vitalists Hertwig belongs to the mechanistic\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nBut both Hertwig and the older school agree in pointing out the _petitio\r\nprincipii_ involved in the assumption that the archetype represents the\r\nancestral form; both reject the simplicist conception of a monophyletic\r\nevolution (which may be likened to the \"one animal\" idea of the\r\ntranscendentalists); both admit the possibility that evolution has taken\r\nplace along many separate and parallel lines, and explain the\r\ncorrespondences shown by these separate lines by the similarity of the\r\nintrinsic laws of evolution; finally, both emphasise the fact that we\r\nknow nothing of the actual course of evolution save the few indications\r\nthat are furnished by palaeontology, and both insist upon the unique\r\nimportance of the palaeontological evidence.[542]\r\n\r\nIt was a curious but very typical characteristic of evolutionary\r\nmorphology that its devotees paid very little attention to the positive\r\nevidence accumulated by the palaeontologists,[543] but shut themselves up\r\nin their tower of ivory and went on with their work of constructing\r\nideal genealogies. It was perhaps fortunate for their peace of mind that\r\nthey knew little of the advances made by palaeontology, for the evidence\r\nacquired through the study of fossil remains was distinctly unfavourable\r\nto the pretty schemes they evolved.\r\n\r\nAs Neumayr, Zittel, Deperet, Steinmann and others have pointed out, the\r\npalaeontological record gives remarkably little support to the ideal\r\ngenealogies worked out by morphologists. There is, for instance, a\r\nstriking absence of transition forms between the great classificatory\r\ngroups. A few types are known which go a little way towards bridging\r\nover the gaps--the famous _Archaeopteryx_, for example--but these do not\r\nalways represent the actual phylogenetic links. There is an almost\r\ncomplete absence of the archetypal ancestral forms which are postulated\r\nby evolutionary morphology. Amphibia do not demonstrably evolve from an\r\narchetypal Proamphibian, nor do mammals derive from a single generalised\r\nPromammalian type. Few of the hypothetical ancestral types imagined by\r\nHaeckel have ever been found as fossils. The great classificatory groups\r\nare almost as distinct in early fossiliferous strata as they are at the\r\npresent day. As Deperet says in his admirable book,[544] in the course of\r\na presentation of the matured views of the great Karl von Zittel, \"We\r\ncannot forget that there exist a vast number of organisms which are not\r\nconnected by any intermediate links, and that the relations between the\r\ngreat divisions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms are much less close\r\nthan the theory [of evolution] demands. Even the Archaeopteryx, the\r\ndiscovery of which made so much stir and appeared to establish a genetic\r\nrelation between classes so distinct as Birds and Reptiles, fills up the\r\ngap only imperfectly, and does not indicate the point of bifurcation of\r\nthese two classes. Intermediate links are lacking between Amphibia and\r\nReptiles. Mammals, too, occupy an isolated position, and no zoologist\r\ncan deny that they are clearly demarcated from other Vertebrates;\r\nindeed, no fossil mammal is certainly known which comes nearer to the\r\nlower Vertebrates than does Ornithorhynchus at the present day\" (p.\r\n115).\r\n\r\nTo take a parallel from the Invertebrata, B. B. Woodward,[545] after\r\ndiscussing the phylogeny of the Mollusca as worked out by the\r\nmorphologists and comparing it with the probable actual course of the\r\nevolution of the group, as evidenced by fossil shells, sums up as\r\nfollows:--\"The lacunae in our knowledge of the interrelationships of the\r\nmembers of the various families and orders of Mollusca are slight\r\nhowever, compared with the blank caused by the total absence from\r\npalaeontological history of any hint of passage forms between the classes\r\nthemselves, or between the Mollusca and their nearest allies. Nor is\r\nthis hiatus confined to the Molluscan phylum; it is the same for all\r\nbranches of the animal kingdom. There is circumstantial evidence that\r\ntransitional forms must have existed, but of actual proof none whatever.\r\nAll the classes of Mollusca appear fully fledged, as it were. No form\r\nhas as yet been discovered of which it could be said that it in any way\r\napproached the hypothecated prorhipidoglossate mollusc, still less one\r\nlinking all the classes\" (p. 79).\r\n\r\nPointing in the same direction as the absence of transitional forms is\r\nthe undeniable fact that all the great groups of animals appear with all\r\ntheir typical characters at a very early geological epoch. Thus, in the\r\nSilurian age a very rich fauna has already developed, and\r\nrepresentatives are found of all the main Invertebrate groups--sponges,\r\ncorals, hydroid colonies, five types of Echinoderms, Bryozoa,\r\nBrachiopods, Worms, many types of Mollusca and Arthropoda. Of\r\nVertebrates, at least two types of fish are present--Ganoids and\r\nElasmobranchs. In the very earliest fossiliferous rocks of all, the\r\nPrecambrian formation, there are remains of Molluscs, Trilobites and\r\nGigantostraca, similar to those which flourished in Cambrian and\r\nSilurian times.\r\n\r\nThe contributions of palaeontology to the solution of the problems of\r\ndescent posed by morphology are, however, not all of this negative\r\ncharacter. The law of recapitulation is in some well-controlled cases\r\ntriumphantly vindicated by palaeontology. Thus Hyatt and others found\r\nthat in Ammonites the first formed coils of the shell often reproduce\r\nthe characters belonging to types known to be ancestral, and what is\r\nmore they have demonstrated the actual occurrence of the phenomenon\r\nknown as acceleration or tachygenesis, often postulated by speculative\r\nmorphologists.[546] This is the tendency universally shown by embryos to\r\nreproduce the characters of their ancestors at earlier and earlier\r\nstages in their development.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable contribution made by palaeontologists to morphology and\r\nto the theory of evolution arose out of the careful and methodical study\r\nof the actual succession of fossil forms as exemplified in limited but\r\nrichly represented groups. Classical examples were the researches of\r\nHilgendorf[547] on the evolution of _Planorbis multiformis_ in the\r\nlacustrine deposits of Steinheim, those of Waagen[548] on the phylogeny of\r\n_Ammonites subradiatus_, and the work of Neumayr and Paul[549] on\r\n_Paludina_ (_Vivipara_).\r\n\r\nThese investigations demonstrated that it was possible to follow out\r\nstep by step in superjacent strata the actual evolution of fossil\r\nspecies and to establish the actual \"phyletic series.\"\r\n\r\nTo take an example from among the Vertebrates, Deperet has shown (_loc.\r\ncit._, pp. 184-9), that the European Proboscidea, belonging to the three\r\ndifferent types of the Elephants, Mastodons and Dinotheria, have evolved\r\nsince the Oligocene epoch along five distinct but continuous lines. The\r\nDinotherian stock is represented at the beginning of the Miocene by the\r\nrelatively small form _D. cuvieri_; this changes progressively\r\nthroughout Miocene times into _D. laevius_, _D. giganteum_, and _D.\r\ngigantissimum_. Among the Mastodons two quite distinct phyletic series\r\ncan be distinguished, the first commencing with _Palaeomastodon\r\nbeadnelli_ of the Oligocene, and evolving between the Miocene and\r\nPliocene into _Mastodon arvernensis_, after traversing the forms _M.\r\nangustidens_ and _M. longirostris_, the second starting with the _M.\r\nturicensis_ of the Lower Miocene and evolving through _M. borsoni_ into\r\nthe _M. americanus_ of the Quaternary. The phyletic series of the true\r\nelephants in Europe are relatively short, and go back only to the\r\nQuaternary, _Elephas antiquus_ giving origin to the Indian elephant, _E.\r\npriscus_ to the African.\r\n\r\nThe careful study of phyletic series brought to light the significant\r\nfact that these lines of filiation tend to run for long stretches of\r\ntime parallel to, and distinct from one another, without connecting\r\nforms. This is clearly exemplified in the case of the Proboscidea, and\r\nmany other examples could be quoted. Almost all rich genera are\r\npolyphyletic in the sense that their component species evolve along\r\nseparate and parallel lines of descent.[550] \"Such great genera as the\r\ngenus _Hoplites_ among the Ammonites, the genus _Cerithium_ among the\r\nGastropoda, the genus _Pecten_ or the genus _Trigonia_ among the\r\nLamellibranchs, each comprise perhaps more than twenty independent\r\nphyletic series\" (Deperet, p. 200).\r\n\r\nVariation along the phyletic lines is gradual[551] and determinate, and\r\nappears to obey definite laws. The earliest members of a phyletic series\r\nare usually small in size and undifferentiated in structure, while the\r\nlater members show a progressive increase in size and complexity. Rapid\r\nextinction often supervenes soon after the line has reached the maximum\r\nof its differentiation.\r\n\r\nThe general picture which palaeontology gives us of the evolution of the\r\nanimal kingdom is accordingly that of an immense number of phyletic\r\nlines which evolve parallel to one another, and without coalescing,\r\nthroughout longer or shorter periods of geological times. \"Each of these\r\nlines culminates sooner or later in mutations of great size and highly\r\nspecialised characters, which become extinct and leave no descendants.\r\nWhen one line disappears by extinction it hands the torch, so to speak,\r\nto another line which has hitherto evolved more slowly, and this line in\r\nits turn traverses the phases of maturity and old age which lead it\r\ninevitably to its doom. The species and genera of the present day belong\r\nto lines that have not reached the senile phase; but it may be surmised\r\nthat some of them, _e.g._ elephants, whales, and ostriches, are\r\napproaching this final phase of their existence\" (Deperet, p. 249).\r\n\r\nIt is one of the paradoxes of biological history that the\r\npalaeontologists have always laid more stress upon the functional side of\r\nliving things than the morphologists, and have, as a consequence, shown\r\nmuch more sympathy for the Lamarckian theory of evolution. The American\r\npalaeontologists in particular--Cope, Hyatt, Ryder, Dall, Packard,\r\nOsborn--have worked out a complete neo-Lamarckian theory based upon the\r\nfossil record.\r\n\r\nThe functional point of view was well to the fore in the works of those\r\ngreat palaeontologists, L. Ruetimeyer (1825-1895) and V. O. Kowalevsky\r\n(1842-83), who seem to have carried on the splendid tradition of Cuvier.\r\nSpeaking of Kowalevsky's classical memoir, _Versuch einer natuerlichen\r\nClassification der fossilen Hufthiere_, Osborn[552] writes:--\"This work is\r\na model union of the detailed study of form and function with theory and\r\nthe working hypothesis. It regards the fossil not as a petrified\r\nskeleton, but as having belonged to a moving and feeding animal; every\r\njoint and facet has a meaning, each cusp a certain significance. Rising\r\nto the philosophy of the matter, it brings the mechanical perfection and\r\nadaptiveness of different types into relation with environment, with\r\nchanges of herbage, with the introduction of grass. In this survey of\r\ncompetition it speculates upon the causes of the rise, spread, and\r\nextinction of each animal group. In other words, the fossil quadrupeds\r\nare treated _biologically_--so far as is possible in the obscurity of\r\nthe past\" (p. 8). The same high praise might with justice be accorded to\r\nthe work of Cope on the functional evolution of the various types of\r\nlimb-skeleton in Vertebrates, and on the evolution of the teeth as well\r\nas to the work of other American palaeontologists, including Osborn\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nOsborn's law of \"adaptive radiation,\" which links on to Darwin's law of\r\ndivergence,[553] constitutes a brilliant vindication of the functional\r\npoint of view. \"According to this law each isolated region, if large and\r\nsufficiently varied in its topography, soil, climate, and vegetation,\r\nwill give rise to a diversified mammalian fauna. From primitive central\r\ntypes branches will spring off in all directions, with teeth and\r\nprehensile organs modified to take advantage of every possible\r\nopportunity of securing food, and in adaptation of the body, limbs and\r\nfeet to habitats of every kind, as shown in the diagram [on p. 363]. The\r\nlarger the region and the more diverse the conditions, the greater the\r\nvariety of mammals which will result.\r\n\r\n\"The most primitive mammals were probably small insectivorous or\r\nomnivorous forms, therefore with simple, short-crowned teeth, of\r\nslow-moving, ambulatory, terrestrial, or arboreal habit, and with short\r\nfeet provided with claws. In seeking food and avoiding enemies in\r\ndifferent habitats the limbs and feet radiate in four diverse\r\ndirections; they either become _fossorial_ or adapted to digging habits,\r\n_natatorial_ or adapted to _amphibious_ and finally to _aquatic_\r\nhabits, _cursorial_ or adapted to swift-moving, terrestrial progression,\r\n_arboreal_ or adapted to tree life. Tree life leads, as its final stage,\r\ninto\r\n\r\n                        LIMBS AND FEET.\r\n                                                        Volant.\r\n                                                          /\r\n            Fossorial.

Similarly in the case of the teeth,\r\ninsectivorous and omnivorous types appear to be more central and ancient\r\nthan either the exclusively carnivorous or herbivorous types. Thus the\r\nextremes of carnivorous adaptation, as in the case of the cats, of\r\nomnivorous adaptation, as in the case of the bears, of herbivorous\r\nadaptation, as in the case of the horses, or myrmecophagous adaptation,\r\nas in the case of the anteaters, are all secondary\" (_loc. cit._, pp.\r\n23-4).\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the end of our historical survey of the problems of\r\nform. What the future course of morphology will be no one can say. But\r\none may hazard the opinion that the present century will see a return to\r\na simpler and more humble attitude towards the great and unsolved\r\nproblems of animal form. Dogmatic materialism and dogmatic theories of\r\nevolution have in the past tended to blind us to the complexity and\r\nmysteriousness of vital phenomena. We need to look at living things with\r\nnew eyes and a truer sympathy. We shall then see them as active, living,\r\npassionate beings like ourselves, and we shall seek in our morphology to\r\ninterpret as far as may be their form in terms of their activity.\r\n\r\nThis is what Aristotle tried to do, and a succession of master-minds\r\nafter him. We shall do well to get all the help from them we can.\r\n\r\n    [519] See E. B.
