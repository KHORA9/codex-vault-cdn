A comprehensive and, at the same time,\r\ndetailed record of the county, dealing more or less fully with the\r\nprincipal events of every town’s life, would require many volumes as\r\nlarge as or larger than ours, and yet might fail to impress the reader\r\nwith the salient features of county life as a whole. In selecting the\r\nsubjects for the various articles comprised in this work, the Editor’s\r\naim has been to single out such as may be expected, for different\r\nreasons, to appeal to all Devonians, and, perhaps, to some unconnected\r\nwith the beautiful shire. The majority of the articles have been written\r\nexpressly for the present work, but three have been reproduced, in\r\nshortened form, from the _Transactions of the Devonshire Association_,\r\nin which they were published many years ago, and so were in danger of\r\nbeing forgotten. The Editor deems he has no need to apologize for thus\r\nenriching the volume with the labours of departed Devonians, whom their\r\ncompatriots recall with deep reverence, and whom, were they living, the\r\nEditor would hail as valued collaborators. Of the other articles, two\r\nhave already seen print in pamphlet form, in which, after many years,\r\nthey had naturally become exceedingly scarce. All the other\r\ncontributions are new, and most of the papers, both old and new, have\r\nbeen embellished with illustrations, some of them curious and rare.\r\n\r\nThe Editor takes this opportunity of rectifying two omissions in his\r\npreliminary sketch. Owing to some accident, he failed to refer to the\r\ndefence of Dartmouth against the attack of Du Chastel in 1404. This\r\nevent was memorable on account of the active part taken by the women,\r\nwho, Amazon-like, hurled flints and pebbles on the French, and thus\r\nexpedited their retirement. The other omission concerns the abortive\r\nCavalier rising of 1655. Penruddock and Groves, the leaders in the\r\naffair (for which they suffered death at Exeter), were both Wiltshire\r\nmen, but it is certainly interesting that an attempt which might have\r\nantedated the Restoration by five years was initiated by the\r\nproclamation of Charles II. at South Molton—a town of the county of\r\nwhich George Monk, to whom the Merry Monarch owed his crown, was a\r\nnative.\r\n\r\nIt only remains for the Editor to thank his many able contributors for\r\ntheir generous assistance, and to express the hope that the plan and\r\nexecution of the work will prove satisfactory to those who desire a\r\nfuller acquaintance with the families, persons, and places therein\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n                                                        F.

We may go\r\nfurther, and say that no English shire is richer, and only a few as\r\nrich, in those pre-historic remains which will always exercise a weird\r\nfascination over cultivated minds that would hold it sin to be incurious\r\nas to the beginnings, or, rather, the age-long development, of man upon\r\nthe earth. The great mausoleum of these remains is Dartmoor, with its\r\nmenhirs, its logans, its cromlechs (or dolmens), its circles and\r\navenues, and its famous clapper-bridge; but all over the county are\r\nspecimens of the typical round barrow, encrusted with hoar legends, and\r\npossessing, in addition, their strict scientific interest. The legends\r\nattach themselves to the individual barrows; the scientific problem is\r\nconcerned with the almost unvarying form and type. Briefly, it may be\r\nstated that the Devonshire round barrow is a late variety of the cairn;\r\nthe long barrow, which is numerously represented in the neighbouring\r\ncounty of Dorset, being older and corresponding to the long-headed race\r\nwhich preceded the round-headed Kelts in the occupation of Britain. The\r\ndifference is between the Stone Age and the Bronze Age, to which the\r\nround barrows belong and bear witness. To the Stone Age are assigned the\r\nchambered round barrows, the so-called giants’ graves, and the stone\r\nkists of Lundy Island.\r\n\r\nRoughly contemporary with the typical round barrows are those mysterious\r\nremains in the great central waste, to which allusion has already been\r\nmade. Just as false systems of astrology were elaborated before the dawn\r\nof clear scientific knowledge, so during the eighteenth century a\r\ncomplete hagiology was constructed respecting these remains, which has\r\nbecome untenable in view of more rigorous historical, philological, and\r\nanthropological investigation. In other words, the accepted\r\ninterpretation of these moorland wonders connected them more or less\r\ndefinitely with Druidism. The prism of imagination presented those\r\nhierarchs in crimson hues. If their functions included inhuman\r\nsacrifices, they themselves were far from being deficient in dignity.\r\nWhat says Southey in _Caradoc_?\r\n\r\n           Within the stones of federation there\r\n           On the green turf, and under the blue sky,\r\n           A noble band—the bards of Britain—stood,\r\n           Their heads in rev’rence bow’d, and bare of foot,\r\n           A deathless brotherhood.\r\n\r\nBut whether as priests or mere medicine men, the existence of Druids in\r\nDevon has yet to be proved. Drewsteignton derives its initial syllable,\r\nnot from them, but from Drogo; Wistman’s Wood comes, not from _wissen_,\r\nbut is more probably _uisg-maen-coed_ disguised in modern garb. And, as\r\nfor those basins on the summits of the Dartmoor tors, they are purely\r\nnatural. So the whole delightful edifice which Polwhele was at such\r\npains to build up, and which Mrs. Bray described to the sympathetic\r\nSouthey, topples down, or, rather, vanishes into thin air, leaving not a\r\nwrack behind.\r\n\r\nWhile the Druids, both locally and generally, belong rather to the\r\nregion of myth than of solid history, the Romans are an indisputable\r\nfact in both senses. Still, their advent in the West Country is not free\r\nfrom obscurity. One thing seems fairly certain, namely, that they did\r\nnot establish themselves in Devonshire by their usual method of\r\nconquest. Exeter, however, was a thoroughly Roman city, and traces of\r\nthe Imperial race are to be found in local names, such as Chester Moor,\r\nnear North Lew, and in the ruins of Roman villas, as at Seaton and\r\nHartland. The siege of Exeter by Vespasian is one of those fictitious\r\nevents which, by dint of constant reiteration, work themselves into the\r\nbrain as substantial verities. The place that Vespasian attacked was not\r\nExeter, but Pensaulcoit (Penselwood), on the borders of Somerset and\r\nWilts. Probably the Romans were content with a protectorate, under which\r\nthe Britons were suffered to retain their nationality and their native\r\nprinces.\r\n\r\nThe Saxons, though known as “wolves,” certainly appeared as sheep or in\r\nsheep’s clothing in their earliest attempts to settle in the county.\r\nThey lived side by side with the Britons, notably at Exeter, where the\r\ndedications of the ancient parishes testify to the juxtaposition of\r\nBritish and Saxon. Here, also, it was that the West Saxon apostle of\r\nGermany, St. Boniface, was educated in a West Saxon school. But this\r\nstate of things was not to last. In 710, Ine, the King of the West\r\nSaxons, vanquished Geraint, prince of Devon, in a pitched battle; and\r\nalthough there is no reason to think that he extended his borders much\r\nto the west of Taunton, the work of subjugation thus begun was continued\r\nby Ine’s successors, primarily by Cynewulf (755–784); and since, in 823,\r\nthe men of Devon were marshalled against their kinsmen, the Cornish, at\r\nGafulford, on the Tamar, the Saxon conquest must by that time have been\r\ncomplete. Still the victors were not satisfied. In 926, as we learn from\r\nWilliam of Malmesbury, Athelstan drove the Britons out of Exeter, and,\r\nconstituting the Tamar the limit of his jurisdiction, converted Devon\r\ninto a purely Saxon province. The immense preponderance of Saxon names\r\nin all parts of the county proves how thoroughly this expropriation of\r\nthe Kelts was carried into effect. The theory held by Sir Francis\r\nPalgrave, amongst others, that the conquest of Devon was accomplished by\r\nhalves, the Exe being for some time the boundary, rests upon no adequate\r\ngrounds, neither evidence nor probability supporting it. In due course,\r\nthe whole county was mapped out into tithings and hundreds, in\r\naccordance with the Saxon methods of administration, and the executive\r\nofficial was the portreeve.\r\n\r\nParallel with the record of Saxon conquest runs the story of Danish\r\nendeavours, stubborn, long-protracted, but, on the whole, less\r\nsuccessful, to secure a footing and affirm the superiority. In the first\r\nhalf of the ninth century, the Vikings, in alliance with the Cornish,\r\nwere routed by Egbert in a decisive engagement at Hingston Down, when,\r\naccording to a Tavistock rhyme—\r\n\r\n                 The blood that flowed down West Street\r\n                 Would heave a stone a pound weight.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter half of the same century, the Danes were again active,\r\nand in 877 made Exeter their headquarters. Seventeen years later they\r\nbesieged the city, which was relieved by Alfred the Great, who confided\r\nthe direction of church affairs in the city and county to the learned\r\nAsser, author of the _Saxon Chronicle_. In 1001, the Danes, having\r\nlanded at Exmouth, made an attempt on Exeter, when the Saxons of Devon\r\nand Somerset, hastening to the rescue, were overthrown in a severe\r\nencounter at Pinhoe, and the piratical invaders returned to their ships,\r\nladen with spoil. The following year was marked by a general massacre of\r\nthe Danes at the behest of Ethelred, and, to avenge this treacherous\r\nslaughter, Sweyn (or Swegen) swooped, like a vulture, on the land, and,\r\nthrough the perfidy of Norman Hugh, the reeve, was admitted within the\r\ngates of Exeter. As usual on such occasions, red ruin was the grim\r\nsequel; but in after days, when the Danish dynasty was in secure\r\npossession of the throne, Canute (or Cnut) cherished no malice by reason\r\nof the tragic horror inflicted on his race, but conferred on Exeter’s\r\nchief monastery the dignity of a cathedral.\r\n\r\nIn a secular as well as in a religious sense, far the most romantic\r\nepisodes of Saxon rule in Devon centre around the old Abbey of St.\r\nRumon, Tavistock, the largest and most splendid of all the conventual\r\ninstitutions in the fair county. Ordulf, the reputed founder, was no\r\nordinary mortal. He looms through the mist of ages as a being of\r\ngigantic stature, whose delight it was, with one stroke of his\r\nhunting-knife, to cleave from their bodies the heads of animals taken in\r\nthe chase, and whose thigh-bone, it is said, is yet preserved in\r\nTavistock Church. But if he had something in common with Goliath and\r\nJohn Ridd, Ordulf was likewise, and very plainly, cousin german to Saint\r\nHubert, for having been bidden in a vision, he built Tavistock Abbey, to\r\nwhose site his wife was conducted by an angel. An alternative version\r\nassociates with him in this pious work his father, Orgar. However that\r\nmay be, the edifice was destroyed by the Danes in the course of a\r\npredatory expedition up the Tamar to Lydford. This was in 997. It was\r\nre-built on a still grander scale, and bore the assaults of time until\r\nthe days of the sacrilegious Hal, when it was suppressed and given to\r\nWilliam, Lord Russell.\r\n\r\nSo much for the Abbey. Now for the secular romance, which yields a\r\nstriking illustration of Shakespeare’s warning:—\r\n\r\n          Friendship is constant in all other things\r\n          Save in the office and affairs of love:\r\n          Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues,\r\n          Let ev’ry eye negotiate for itself\r\n          And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch\r\n          Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.\r\n\r\nOrgar, the father of Ordulf, had a daughter named Elfrida, the fame of\r\nwhose loveliness came to the ears of the King. Edgar, being unwedded,\r\ndespatched Earl Ethelwold to Tavistock on a mission of observation, and\r\nthe courtier was empowered, if report erred not, to demand her in\r\nmarriage for his royal master. Ethelwold came, and saw, and was\r\nconquered. Although much older than the fair lady, he fell in love with\r\nher, and gained her assent and that of her father to their union. This\r\nhe could do only by concealing from them the more advantageous offer of\r\na royal alliance. With equal duplicity he kept from the King not only\r\nthe knowledge of his bride’s surpassing beauty, but the bride herself,\r\nbeing assured that her appearance at court would be fatal. However, in\r\nno long time the truth leaked out, and Edgar set out for Dartmoor,\r\nostensibly to hunt. Ethelwold, in desperation, now made full confession\r\nto his wife, whom he charged to disguise her charms, but the vain and\r\nambitious woman, angered at his deceit, displayed them the more, and the\r\nKing, resolved on Ethelwold’s death, actually slew him at Wilverley or\r\nWarlwood in the Forest.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the Romans and before the final absorption of\r\nDevon by the Saxons, there are signs that the Kelts of South-West\r\nBritain were in intimate touch with their brethren on the other side of\r\nSt. George’s Channel. At any rate, the Ogham inscriptions found in the\r\nneighbourhood of Tavistock testify to the missionary enterprise of the\r\nIsland of Saints during the latter part of the fifth and the beginning\r\nof the sixth centuries after Christ. For most purposes, the centre of\r\ncounty life has from the first been Exeter, but to this rule there was\r\nat one time an important exception, which was not Tavistock, but the\r\nlittle town of Crediton, situated on a tributary of the Exe. An old\r\nrhyme has it—\r\n\r\n                     Kirton was a market town,\r\n                     When Exeter was a fuzzy down.\r\n\r\nLittle can be said for this view on general historic grounds, but from\r\nthe standpoint of ecclesiastical Anglo-Saxondom, Crediton had a decided\r\nclaim to the preference, for was it not the birthplace of Winfrid (St.\r\nBoniface), and the seat of the Anglo-Saxon bishops from the year 909\r\nuntil 1050, when Leofric, for fear of the Danes, transferred the see to\r\nExeter? This prelate was installed by Edward the Confessor and Queen\r\nEdith, who, holding him by the hands, invoked God’s blessing on future\r\nbenefactors.\r\n\r\nIf the Ogham stones of Dartmoor attest the zeal of Keltic Christianity,\r\nCoplestone Cross, a richly-carved monument near Crediton, is a reminder\r\nof the early days of Saxon piety, when such crosses were erected as\r\nshrines for the churchless ceorls. Coplestone, also, was the name of a\r\npowerful race known as the Great Coplestones, or Coplestones of the\r\nWhite Spur, who claimed, but apparently without reason, to have been\r\nthanes in Saxon times. In the West Country, no distich is more popular\r\nor more widely diffused than the odd little couplet—\r\n\r\n               Croker, Cruwys, and Coplestone,\r\n               When the Conqueror came, were all at home.\r\n\r\nThe invincible William knocked at the gates of the Western capital in\r\n1066, and was at first refused admission. If it be true, as Sir Francis\r\nPalgrave held, that Exeter was a free republic before Athelstan\r\nengirdled it with massive walls, the _genius loci_ asserted itself with\r\ndramatic effect when the Conqueror demanded submission, and, in the\r\nwords of Freeman, “she, or at least her rulers, professed themselves\r\nwilling to receive William as an external lord, to pay him the tribute\r\nwhich had been paid to the old kings, but refused to admit him within\r\nher walls as her immediate sovereign.” Dissatisfied with this response,\r\nWilliam besieged the city, which held out for eighteen days, and then\r\nsurrendered on conditions. Exeter, it may be observed, was at this time\r\none of the four principal cities of the realm, the other members of the\r\nquartette being London, Winchester, and York.\r\n\r\nThe capitulation was followed by the building of Rougemont Castle, not a\r\nmoment too soon, for ere it could well have been completed, the sons of\r\nHarold led an assault on Exeter. This was repulsed without much\r\ndifficulty by the Norman garrison, but the Saxons showed themselves\r\nstill restless in the West. The army of Godwin and Edmund fought with\r\nfruitless valour on the banks of the Tavy until, three years after the\r\nopening of the struggle, Sithric, the last Saxon abbot of Tavistock,\r\nbetook himself to the Camp of Refuge at Ely, to be under the protection\r\nof the noble Hereward.\r\n\r\nExeter, to which one always returns, stands out prominently among\r\nEnglish towns on account of its many sieges. Old Isaacke, happily a much\r\nbetter chronicler than poet, testifies as follows:—\r\n\r\n            In midst of Devon Exeter city seated,\r\n            Hath with ten sieges grievously been straitned.\r\n\r\nThis is sure proof of the immense value attached to the possession of\r\nthe place in troublous times, and prepares us for the conspicuous part\r\ntaken by both county and city in the centuries that succeeded the\r\nestablishment of Norman rule. The first Norman governor was Baldwin de\r\nRedvers, whose grandson, another Baldwin, declared for Matilda when\r\ncivil war broke out between her party and Stephen’s. The citizens, on\r\nthe other hand, espoused the cause of the King, and were subjected to\r\nall sorts of barbarities, until the approach of a vanguard of two\r\nhundred horse compelled the retreat of the garrison into the castle.\r\nAfter a three months’ siege, water failed, and the doughty defenders\r\nwere forced to yield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\n               _From a Photograph_]     [_by Frith & Co._\r\n                       ROUGEMONT CASTLE, EXETER.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nEdward I. held a parliament at Exeter, and his great-grandson, the\r\nfamous Black Prince, must have been well acquainted with the city, as he\r\npassed through it more than once _en route_ to Plymouth, whence he\r\nsailed to France on the glorious expedition which ended at Poictiers.\r\nIts relations with the Black Prince reveal to us how much the county has\r\nreceded in practical importance since medieval times. Plymouth, indeed,\r\nmaintains her place: she is as great now, perhaps greater, than she was\r\nthen; and Dartmouth, charming Dartmouth, is still far from obscure.\r\nNevertheless, it is idle to claim for the ports of Devon as a class the\r\nrelative standing they once enjoyed, when, according to the _Libel of\r\nEnglish Policy_, Edward III., bent on suppressing the pirates of St.\r\nMalo—\r\n\r\n                                          did dewise\r\n              Of English towns three, that is to say,\r\n              Dartmouth, Plymouth, the third it is Fowey;\r\n              And gave them help and notable puissance\r\n              Upon pety Bretayne for to werre.\r\n\r\nAnd when Chaucer has to depict a typical mariner, he begins with the\r\nwords—\r\n\r\n               A schipman was ther, wonyng far by weste;\r\n               For ought I woot, he was of Dertemouth.\r\n\r\n—obviously because of Dartmouth’s national reputation. Topsham, formerly\r\nthe port of Exeter, is a truly startling instance of decline, since as\r\nlate as the reign of William III. London alone exceeded it in the amount\r\nof its trade with Newfoundland. On the other hand, Bideford never\r\npossessed all the importance that Kingsley attributes to it, though\r\nrelatively of much greater consequence in ancient days than at present.\r\nIt is a curious fact that Ilfracombe, that popular watering-place, sent\r\nsix ships to the siege of Calais, as compared with Liverpool’s one,\r\nDartmouth contributing thirty-one, and Plymouth twenty-six.\r\n\r\nThe Black Prince was the first Duke of Cornwall, and the stannaries or\r\ntin-bearing districts of Devon and Cornwall, which in Saxon and Norman\r\ntimes had been a royal demesne, passed to this valiant prince and his\r\nsuccessors. The old Crockern Tor Parliament would furnish material for a\r\nfascinating chapter in the romance of history, but the present sketch is\r\nnecessarily too brief to admit of much discussion. Its regulations\r\ncertainly did not err on the side of leniency. “The punishment,” says\r\nMrs. Bray, “for him who in days of old brought bad tin to the market was\r\nto have a certain quantity of it poured down his throat in a melted\r\nstate.” The most important event in the annals of Chagford, one of the\r\nstannary towns, is the falling in of the market-house on Mr. Eveleigh,\r\nthe steward, and nine other persons, all of whom were killed. This sad\r\ndisaster, which occurred “presently after dinner,” is the subject of a\r\nrare black-letter tract, entitled, _True Relation of the Accident at\r\nChagford in Devonshire_.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the Wars of the Roses, the West of England for the most\r\npart supported the Lancastrian cause. In 1469, Exeter was besieged for\r\ntwelve days by Sir William Courtenay, in the interest of Edward IV.; and\r\nin the following year, Clarence and Warwick repaired to the city prior\r\nto embarking at Dartmouth for Calais. When, however, Edward IV., seated\r\nfirmly on the throne, appeared in Exeter as _de facto_ sovereign of the\r\nrealm, the citizens, forgetting past grudges, provided such a welcome\r\nfor the monarch, his consort, and his infant son, that he presented the\r\nCorporation with the sword of state still borne before the Mayor. The\r\ncity had given him a hundred nobles. Just twice that sum was the loyal\r\noffering to Richard III. when, in 1483, he arrived at Exeter soon after\r\nthe Marquis of Dorset had proclaimed the Earl of Richmond King. A\r\ngruesome incident marked his visit, for Richard, that best-hated of\r\nEnglish rulers, caused his brother-in-law, Sir Thomas St. Leger, to be\r\nbeheaded in the court-yard of the Castle. The name, Rougemont, jarred on\r\nhis superstitious nature, the reason being its similarity to Richmond.\r\nThe point is referred to by Shakespeare in the well-known play:—\r\n\r\n           When last I was at Exeter\r\n           The Mayor in courtesy showed me the castle,\r\n           And called it Rougemont; at which name I started,\r\n           Because a bard of Ireland told me once\r\n           I should not live long after I saw Richmond.\r\n\r\nIn 1497, that bold adventurer, Perkin Warbeck, claimed admission within\r\nthe walls, which, so far as the citizens were concerned, would have been\r\nreadily granted. The Earl of Devon and his son were less accommodating,\r\nand, after Warbeck had set fire to the gates, succeeded in beating off\r\nhis attack. The pretender’s next appearance in the city, where the King\r\nhad taken up his quarters, was in the character of a prisoner. Henry’s\r\nconduct towards his rebellious subjects was worthy of a great prince,\r\nand affords a marked contrast to the brutality that characterized the\r\nsuppression of the next revolt and the still more notorious savagery of\r\n“Kirke’s Lambs.” When brought before him, “bareheaded, in their shirts,\r\nand halters round their necks,” he “graciously pardoned them, choosing\r\nrather to wash his hands in milk by forgiving than in blood by\r\ndestroying them.”\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the Reformation was not the popular event in England\r\nthat it was in Scotland, and the introduction of the Book of Common\r\nPrayer in lieu of the Mass was the torch which, in 1549, set the western\r\nshires—Cornwall, and Somerset, and Devon—in a blaze. The opposition,\r\nstarted at Sampford Courtenay by a pair of simple villagers, soon came\r\nto include leaders of the stamp of Sir Thomas Pomeroy and Sir Humphry\r\nArundel, who barricaded Crediton, the rendezvous of their party. The\r\ninterests of the Crown were befriended by Sir Peter and Sir Gawen Carew,\r\nwho, though utterly unscrupulous and barbarous in their methods of\r\nwarfare, failed to arrest the insurrection. Presently no fewer than ten\r\nthousand rebels commenced the investment of Exeter. At this serious\r\njuncture, the Lord Lieutenant of the county (Lord Russell) took the helm\r\nof affairs, and ultimately raised the siege, the city in the meantime\r\nbeing reduced to terrible straits through famine. But the rebels\r\nsuffered, too. In all, four thousand peasants fell in the Western\r\nRising. A dramatic episode was the execution of the Vicar of St. Thomas,\r\nwho was hanged in full canonicals on his church, where his corpse\r\nremained suspended till the reign of Edward’s successor, when the Roman\r\nCatholics regained, for a season, the upper hand.\r\n\r\nThe geographical position of Devonshire suggests, what is also the fact,\r\nthat the county had a considerable share in the colonization of the\r\nWestern Hemisphere. The first port in Devon to send out ships to America\r\nfor the purpose of establishing settlements was Dartmouth. In this\r\nenterprise, Humphry and Adrian Gilbert, who were half-brothers of Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh, and whose seat, Greenway, was close to Dartmouth, took\r\nthe lead. The pioneer expedition, which took place in 1579, was\r\nproductive of no result; but in 1583, Humphry Gilbert seized\r\nNewfoundland, the present inhabitants of which are largely of Devon\r\nancestry. This navigator, though brave and skilful, rests under an ugly\r\nimputation which we must all hope is baseless. According to some, he\r\nproposed to Queen Elizabeth the perfidious destruction of the foreign\r\nfishing fleets which had long made the island their station. During his\r\nhomeward voyage Humphry was drowned, and the manner of his death is\r\ndepicted in an old ballad:—\r\n\r\n                    He sat upon the deck;\r\n                      The book was in his hand.\r\n                    “Do not fear; Heaven is as near\r\n                      By water as by land.”\r\n\r\nAdrian Gilbert interested himself in the discovery of the North-West\r\nPassage, but neither of the brothers did much more than secure for\r\nDartmouth a principal share in the Newfoundland trade, for many and many\r\na year one of the chief props of Devon commerce.\r\n\r\nOf far greater practical significance, as a centre of maritime\r\nadventure, was Plymouth. Hence sprang William Hawkins, the first of his\r\nnation to sail a ship in the Southern Seas. Hence sprang his more famous\r\nson, Sir John Hawkins, the first Englishman that ever entered the Bay of\r\nMexico, and who spent the bribes of Philip of Spain in defensive\r\npreparations against that tyrant’s fleet. Here was organized the\r\nPlymouth Company founded for the colonization of North Virginia after\r\nthe failure of Sir Walter Raleigh (who, like Sir Humphry Gilbert, had\r\nmade Plymouth his base) to form a settlement. The efforts of the\r\nPlymouth Company were at first not very felicitous, but in 1620 it\r\nreceived a new charter, and although its schemes were absurdly\r\nambitious, and fell ludicrously short of realization, and although it\r\nwas administered for private ends rather than in a large spirit of\r\nenlightened patriotism, still the mere existence of the company must\r\nhave tended to promote the flow of men and money to the new plantations\r\nbeyond the seas.\r\n\r\nIn the Great Civil War, the towns generally were in favour of the\r\nParliament, but Exeter, on which city Elizabeth had conferred the proud\r\nmotto _Semper fidelis_, appears to have been Royalist in sympathy. As,\r\nhowever, the Earl of Bedford, the Lord Lieutenant, held it for the\r\nopposite party, it was besieged by Prince Maurice, to whom it\r\nsurrendered in September, 1643. In April, 1646, it was recovered by the\r\nRoundheads, but ere this many interesting events had come to pass. In\r\nMay, 1644, Queen Henrietta Maria had arrived in the city, and there, on\r\nJune 16th, was born the Princess Henrietta Anne, afterwards Duchess of\r\nOrleans. Just at this moment, the Earl of Essex made his appearance, and\r\nthe Queen was fain to escape alone, leaving her infant in the charge of\r\nLady Moreton and Sir John Berkeley, who arranged for her christening in\r\nthe font of Exeter Cathedral. Her portrait by Sir Peter Lely, which\r\nadorns the Guildhall, was the gift of Charles II., who, in 1671, thus\r\ntestified his appreciation of the city’s good services. The donor\r\nhimself had been the guest of the Corporation in July, 1644, when his\r\nroyal father had received from the civic authorities a present of five\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\nLooking further afield, Devonshire was the theatre of many stirring\r\nevents in that fratricidal struggle. It was in 1642 that the High\r\nSheriff, Sir Edmund Fortescue, of Fallapit, at the instigation of Sir\r\nRalph Hopton, called out the _posse comitatus_, and so precipitated a\r\nconflict. Sir Ralph himself, with the aid of Sir Nicholas Slanning,\r\nassembled a force of some two or three thousand men, with which he\r\ncaptured first Tavistock, and then Plympton, afterwards joining\r\nFortescue at Modbury, where a mixed army of trained bands and levies was\r\nsoon in being. The next proceeding was to have been an attack on\r\nPlymouth, but Colonel Ruthven, the commandant of that town, sent out\r\nfive hundred horse, which, after a feint at Tavistock, dashed through\r\nIvybridge, and delivered a sudden assault on Modbury. In a moment all\r\nwas over. Exclaiming, “The troopers are come!” the trained bands fled in\r\nconfusion, while the rest of the army, who knew nothing about soldiering\r\nand had no love for the cause, went after them, save for a few friends\r\nof the Sheriff, who helped him to defend the mansion of Mr.\r\nChampernowne. When this was fired, the movement collapsed, and the\r\nRoundheads, who had lost but one man, effected a good haul of county\r\nnotabilities, including the High Sheriff, John Fortescue, Sir Edmund\r\nSeymour, and his eldest son, Edmund Seymour, M.P., Colonel Henry\r\nChampernowne, Arthur Basset, and Thomas Shipcote, the Clerk of the\r\nPeace. About a score of these worthies of Devon were placed on board\r\nship at Dartmouth, and transported to London.\r\n\r\nThis initial success of the Roundheads was soon qualified by reverses.\r\nRuthven, having marched into Cornwall, was encountered by Hopton at\r\nBraddock Down, and sustained a crushing defeat. In February, 1643,\r\nHopton laid siege to Plymouth, but Fortune again veered, and the\r\nRoyalists were forced to retire in consequence of a second defeat at\r\nModbury. Attempts were made to bring about a _pax occidentalis_, by\r\nwhich both parties were to forswear further participation in the\r\nunnatural strife, but they proved abortive. Encouraged by the defeat of\r\nthe Earl of Stamford at Stratton, a Cornish army advanced northwards on\r\nthe disastrous march which resulted in the overthrow at Lansdown, near\r\nBath, and involved the loss of four leading Royalists—Sir Bevil\r\nGrenville, Trevanion, Slanning, and Sidney Godolphin—the last of whom\r\nfell in a miserable skirmish at Chagford.\r\n\r\nLater in the year, Prince Maurice exerted himself to reduce Plymouth,\r\nbut, although the Cavaliers fought well, the garrison, equally brave and\r\nperhaps more pious, drove them back to the cry of “God with us!” Among\r\nthe besiegers was King Charles himself, but not even the presence of\r\nroyalty could alter the situation, and he and Maurice presently withdrew\r\nfrom the scene of operations. The siege was not ended till the spring of\r\n1645, in the January of which year Roundheads and Cavaliers occupied the\r\nsame relative positions as Britons and Boers in the memorable fight at\r\nWagon Hill. Even after this terrible repulse, the Cavaliers did not\r\nquite abandon hope, and several small actions took place; but the advent\r\nof Fairfax in 1646 led to a precipitate retreat, and the Cavalier\r\nstrongholds—Mount Edgecumbe and Ince House—gallantly defended\r\nthroughout, had to be given up.\r\n\r\nThe last place in Devon to be held for King Charles was Salcombe Castle,\r\nand the person who held it was the very Sir Edmund Fortescue who was\r\nHigh Sheriff, in 1642, and, in that capacity, threw down the glove to\r\nhis opponents. The “Old Bulwarke” was not a promising fort, but it stood\r\na siege of four months, when the garrison were allowed to march out with\r\nthe honours of war. Among other articles of surrender, it was stipulated\r\nthat John Snell, Vicar of Thurlestone, who had acted as chaplain to the\r\ngarrison, should be allowed quiet possession of his parsonage. This\r\ncondition was not observed. However, Parson Snell was not forgotten\r\nafter the Reformation, as he was appointed Canon Residentiary of Exeter,\r\nin which position he was succeeded by his sons. By the 7th of May, the\r\ndate of the surrender, the cause of King Charles was _in extremis_; and,\r\naccordingly, Fort Charles, as Sir Edmund had re-named the castle, was\r\nfully justified in capitulating. The key of the castle is said to be\r\nstill the treasured heirloom of the hero’s representative.\r\n\r\nDevon men took an active part in the Monmouth Rebellion; and, in common\r\nwith its neighbours, the county experienced the judicial atrocities of\r\nthe notorious Jeffreys. A “bloody assize” was opened at Exeter on\r\nSeptember 14th, 1685, when twenty-one rebels were sentenced, thirteen of\r\nwhom were executed. Thirteen more were fined and whipped, and one was\r\nreprieved. A feature in this assize was the publication of 342 names,\r\nall belonging to persons who were at large when the business closed.\r\nThese comparatively fortunate yeomen had escaped the search of the civil\r\nand military powers, and were tenants of the open country, living in\r\ncopses and haystacks as best they might.\r\n\r\nHowever, vengeance was not long delayed. In 1688, the Prince of Orange\r\nlanded at Brixham, and marched to Exeter by way of Chudleigh. The\r\naccount of an eye-witness printed in the Harleian Miscellany gives the\r\nimpression that his entry into the city, as a spectacle, was somewhat\r\nbarbaric. The pageant included two hundred blacks from the plantations\r\nof the Netherlands in America, with embroidered caps lined with white\r\nfur, and crested with plumes of white feathers; and two hundred\r\nFinlanders or Laplanders in bear-skins taken from the beasts they had\r\nslain, with black armour and broad, flaming swords. The troops were\r\nreceived with loud acclamations by the people at the west gate, and\r\ntheir conduct was excellent. Meanwhile, the position of the authorities\r\nwas far from enviable. In vulgar parlance, they were in a “tight place,”\r\nnot knowing which way the wind would blow, and being desirous of\r\nmaintaining the reputation of the city for unswerving loyalty. The\r\nBishop and the Dean adopted the safe, if not too heroic, method of\r\nflight, while the Mayor, with more dignity, commanded the west gate to\r\nbe closed, and declined to receive the Prince. The poor priest-vicars,\r\nno less faithful at heart, were intimidated into omitting the prayer for\r\nthe Prince of Wales, and employing only one prayer for the King. On the\r\nninth, notice was sent to the canons, vicars-choral, and singing lads,\r\nthat the Prince would attend the service in the Cathedral at noon, and\r\nthey were ordered by Dr. Burnet to chant the _Te Deum_ when His Highness\r\nentered the choir. This they did. The Prince occupied the Bishop’s\r\nthrone, surrounded by his great officers, and after the _Te Deum_, Dr.\r\nBurnet, from a seat under the pulpit, read aloud His Highness’s\r\ndeclaration. The party then returned to the Deanery, where William had\r\ntaken up his quarters.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Orange was in Exeter for three days before any of the\r\ncounty gentry appeared in his support, and naturally the members of his\r\nsuite began to feel disconcerted. Presently, however, the gentlemen of\r\nDevon rallied to his standard, and in compliance with a proposal of Sir\r\nEdward Seymour, formed a general association for promoting his interest.\r\nA notable arrival was Mr. Hugh Speke, who, it is said, had been\r\npersonally offered by King James the return of a fine of £5,000 if he\r\nwould atone for his support of Monmouth by acting as spy on the Prince\r\nof Orange, and had bravely refused. The Mayor and Aldermen now thought\r\nit high time to recognise the change in the situation and observe a\r\ngreater measure of respect towards one who, it seemed likely, would soon\r\nbe their lawful sovereign. The Dean, too, hastened home to give in his\r\nadhesion to the Prince; and William left Exeter with the assurance that\r\nthe West Country, which could not forgive the Jacobite massacre, was\r\nheart and soul with him, and that elsewhere the power of his despotic\r\nfather-in-law was rapidly crumbling.\r\n\r\nIn a second letter, reproduced in the Harleian Miscellany, we are\r\ninformed that there had been “lately driven into Dartmouth, and since\r\ntaken, a French vessel loaded altogether with images and knives of a\r\nvery large proportion, in length nineteen inches, and in breadth two\r\ninches and an half; what they were designed for, God only knows.”\r\nPossibly for a purpose not wholly unlike that which inspired the\r\nunpleasant visit of some of the same nation to Teignmouth in 1690, when\r\nthey fired the town. It appears that the county force had been drafted\r\nto Torquay with the object of resisting a threatened landing from the\r\nFrench fleet, which was anchored in the bay. Certain French galleys,\r\navailing themselves of the opportunity thus afforded them, stole round\r\nto Teignmouth, threw about two hundred great shot into the town, and\r\ndisembarked 1,700 men, who wrought immense damage in the place, already\r\ndeserted by its inhabitants. For three hours there was pillage, and then\r\nover a hundred houses were burnt. A contemporary named Jordan,\r\nrecounting the circumstances, cannot restrain his righteous indignation.\r\n“Moreover,” says he, “to add sacrilege to their robbery and violence,\r\nthey, in a barbarous manner, entered the two churches in the said town,\r\nand in a most unchristian manner tore the Bibles and Common Prayer Books\r\nin pieces, scattering the leaves thereof about the streets, broke down\r\nthe pulpits, overthrew the Communion tables, together also with many\r\nother marks of a barbarous and enraged cruelty; and such goods and\r\nmerchandize as they could not or dare not stay to carry away, they\r\nspoiled and destroyed, killing very many cattle and hogs, which they\r\nleft dead behind them in the streets.” This, the last, invasion of\r\nDevonshire, cost the county £11,030, the amount at which the damage was\r\nassessed, and which was raised by collections in the churches after the\r\nreading of a brief. French Street, Teignmouth, conserves by its name the\r\nmemory of this heavy, but happily transient, disaster.\r\n\r\nWith the seventeenth century ends the heroic period of Devonian history.\r\nFrom that time it figures merely as a province sharing in the triumphs\r\nand distresses of the country of which it forms part, but having no\r\nspecial or distinctive record. The most exciting era was, without doubt,\r\nthe Napoleonic age, when the dread of a new French invasion was\r\nterminated only by the glorious victory of Trafalgar.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be mentioned that Sidmouth was the early home of\r\nher late Majesty Queen Victoria. Her father, the Duke of Kent, died\r\nthere in 1820, and the west window of the church was erected as a\r\nmemorial of this son of George III., whose visit to Exeter in the\r\npreceding century gave such delight to the county.\r\n\r\n                                                         THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE MYTH OF BRUTUS THE TROJAN.\r\n\r\n                 BY THE LATE R. N. WORTH, F.G.S., ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrutus, son of Sylvius, grandson of Æneas the Trojan, killed his father\r\nwhile hunting, was expelled from Italy, and settled in Greece. Here the\r\nscattered Trojans, to the number of seven thousand, besides women and\r\nchildren, placed themselves under his command, and, led by him, defeated\r\nthe Grecian King Pandrasus. The terms of peace were hard. Pandrasus gave\r\nBrutus his daughter, Ignoge, to wife, and provided 324 ships, laden with\r\nall kinds of provisions, in which the Trojan host sailed away to seek\r\ntheir fortune. An oracle of Diana directed them to an island in the\r\nWestern Sea, beyond Gaul, “by giants once possessed.” Voyaging amidst\r\nperils, upon the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea they found four nations of\r\nTrojan descent, under the rule of Corinæus, who afterwards became the\r\nCornish folk. Uniting their forces, the Trojans sailed to the Loire,\r\nwhere they defeated the Gauls and ravaged Aquitaine with fire and sword.\r\nThen Brutus\r\n\r\n  “... Repaired to the fleet, and loading it with the riches and spoils\r\n  he had taken, set sail with a fair wind towards the promised island,\r\n  and arrived on the coast of Totnes. This island was then called\r\n  Albion, and was inhabited by none but a few giants. Notwithstanding\r\n  this, the pleasant situation of the places, the plenty of rivers\r\n  abounding with fish, and the engaging prospect of its woods, made\r\n  Brutus and his company very desirous to fix their habitation in it.\r\n  They therefore passed through all the provinces, forced the giants to\r\n  fly into the caves of the mountains, and divided the country among\r\n  them, according to the directions of their commander. After this they\r\n  began to till the ground and build houses, so that in a little time\r\n  the country looked like a place that had been long inhabited. At last\r\n  Brutus called the island after his own name, Britain, and his\r\n  companions Britons; for by these means he desired to perpetuate the\r\n  memory of his name; from whence afterwards the language of the nation,\r\n  which at first bore the name of Trojan or rough Greek, was called\r\n  British. But Corinæus, in imitation of his leader, called that part of\r\n  the island which fell to his share Corina, and his people Corineans,\r\n  after his name; and though he had his choice of the provinces before\r\n  all the rest, yet he preferred this county, which is now called in\r\n  Latin Cornubia, either from its being in the shape of a horn (in Latin\r\n  _Cornu_), or from the corruption of the same name. For it was a\r\n  diversion to him to encounter the said giants, which were in greater\r\n  numbers there than in all the other provinces that fell to the share\r\n  of his companions. Among the rest was one detestable monster called\r\n  Goemagot, in stature twelve cubits, and of such prodigious strength\r\n  that at one stroke he pulled up an oak as if it had been a hazel wand.\r\n  On a certain day, when Brutus was holding a solemn festival to the\r\n  gods in the port where they at first landed, this giant, with twenty\r\n  more of his companions, came in upon the Britons, among whom he made a\r\n  dreadful slaughter. But the Britons at last, assembling together in a\r\n  body, put them to the rout, and killed them every one, except\r\n  Goemagot. Brutus had given orders to have him preserved alive, out of\r\n  a desire to see a combat between him and Corinæus, who took a great\r\n  pleasure in such encounters. Corinæus, overjoyed at this, prepared\r\n  himself, and, throwing aside his arms, challenged him to wrestle with\r\n  him. At the beginning of the encounter, Corinæus and the giant,\r\n  standing front to front, held each other strongly in their arms, and\r\n  panted aloud for breath; but Goemagot presently grasping Corinæus with\r\n  all his might, broke three of his ribs, two on his right side and one\r\n  on his left; at which Corinæus, highly enraged, roused up his whole\r\n  strength, and snatching him upon his shoulder, ran with him, as fast\r\n  as the weight would allow him, to the next shore, and there getting\r\n  upon the top of a high rock, hurled down the savage monster into the\r\n  sea, where, falling on the sides of craggy rocks, he was torn to\r\n  pieces, and coloured the waves with his blood. The place where he\r\n  fell, taking its name from the giant’s fall, is called Lam Goemagot,\r\n  that is, Goemagot’s Leap, to this day.”[1]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  _Geoffrey of Monmouth_, Giles’ Translation.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSuch, in its complete form, is the myth of Brutus the Trojan, as told by\r\nGeoffrey of Monmouth, sometime Bishop of St. Asaph, who professed, and\r\nprobably with truth, to translate the British history of which it forms\r\na part from “a very ancient book in the British tongue,” given to him by\r\nWalter Mapes, by whom it had been brought from Brittany. Geoffrey wrote\r\nin the earlier part of the twelfth century, and he does not indicate\r\nwith more precision than the use of the term “very ancient” the date of\r\nhis original.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we are to accept the writings of Nennius as they have been\r\nhanded down as substantially of the date assigned to them by the\r\nauthor—the middle of the ninth century—the legend of Brutus, though not\r\nin the full dimensions of the Geoffreian myth, was current at least a\r\nthousand years ago; and in two forms. In one account, Nennius states\r\nthat our island derives its name from Brutus, a Roman consul, grandson\r\nof Æneas, who shot his father with an arrow, and, being expelled from\r\nItaly, after sundry wanderings settled in Britain—a statement that\r\nagrees fairly well with that of Geoffrey. In the other account, which\r\nNennius says he had learned from the ancient books of his ancestors,\r\nBrutus, though still through Rhea Silvia, his great-grandmother, of\r\nTrojan descent, was grandson of Alanus, the first man who dwelt in\r\nEurope, twelfth in descent from Japhet in his Trojan genealogy, and\r\ntwentieth on the side of his great-grandfather, Fethuir. Alanus is a\r\nkind of European Noah, with three sons—Hisicion, Armenon, and Neugio;\r\nand all his grandsons are reputed to have founded nations—Francus,\r\nRomanus, Alamanus, Brutus, Gothus, Valagothus, Cibidus, Burgundus,\r\nLongobardus, Vandalus, Saxo, Boganus. He is wholly mythical.\r\n\r\nBrutus here does not stand alone. He falls into place as part of a\r\npatriarchal tradition, assigning to each of the leading peoples of\r\nEurope an ancestor who had left them the heritage of his name. This one\r\nfact, to my mind, removes all suspicion of the genuineness of these\r\npassages of Nennius, which have been sometimes regarded as\r\ninterpolations. With Geoffrey not only is the story greatly amplified,\r\nbut it is detached from its relations, and is no longer part of what may\r\nfairly be called one organic whole. Nennius, therefore, gives us an\r\nearlier form of the myth than Geoffrey. I think, too, that the essential\r\ndistinctions of the two accounts render it clear that the ancient\r\nauthorities of Nennius and Geoffrey are not identical, from which we may\r\ninfer that the original tradition is of far older date than either of\r\nthese early recorders.\r\n\r\nBut we may go still further. Whether the legend of Brutus is still\r\nextant in an Armoric form, I am not aware, but it appears in Welsh MSS.\r\nof an early date; the “Brut Tysilio” and the “Brut Gr. ab Arthur” being\r\nimportant. It has been questioned whether, in effect, these are not\r\ntranslations of Geoffrey; but there seems no more reason for assuming\r\nthis than for disbelieving the direct statement of Geoffrey himself,\r\nthat he obtained his materials from a Breton source. Bretons, Welsh, and\r\nCornish are not only kindred in blood and tongue, but, up to the time\r\nwhen the continuity of their later national or tribal life was rudely\r\nshattered, had a common history and tradition, which became the general\r\nheritage. If the story of Brutus has any relation to the early career of\r\nthe British folk, we should expect to discover traces of the legend\r\nwherever the Britons found their way. If this suggestion be correct, if\r\nGeoffrey drew from Armoric sources, and if the “Brut Tysilio,” which is\r\ngenerally regarded as the oldest of the Welsh chronicles, represents an\r\nindependent stream, the myth must be dated back far beyond even Nennius,\r\nas the common property of the Western Britons, ere, in the early part of\r\nthe seventh century, the successes of the Saxons hemmed one section into\r\nWales, another into Cornwall, and drove a third portion into exile with\r\ntheir kindred in Armorica. There is, consequently, good reason to\r\nbelieve that the tradition is as old as any other portion of our\r\nearliest recorded history or quasi-history, and covers, at least, the\r\nwhole of our historical period.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of Geoffrey does not give the myth in quite its fullest\r\nshape. For that we have to turn to local sources. Tradition has long\r\nconnected the landing of Brutus with the good town of Totnes; the combat\r\nbetween Corinæus and Goemagot with Plymouth Hoe. Like the bricks in the\r\nchimney called in to witness to the noble ancestry of Cade, has not\r\nTotnes its “Brutus stone”? And did not Plymouth have its “Goemagot”?\r\n\r\nThe whole history of the “Brutus stone” appears to be traditional, if\r\nnot recent. My friend, Mr. Edward Windeatt, informs me that it is not\r\nmentioned anywhere in the records of the ancient borough of Totnes. I\r\nfail to find any trace of it in the pages of our local chroniclers,\r\nbeyond the statement of Prince (_Worthies_) that “there is yet remaining\r\ntowards the lower end of the town of Totnes a certain rock called\r\nBrute’s Stone, which tradition here more pleasantly than positively says\r\nis that on which Brute first set his foot when he came ashore.” The good\r\npeople of Totnes, so it is said, have had it handed down to them by\r\ntheir fathers from a time beyond the memory of man, that Brutus, when he\r\nsailed up the Dart, which must consequently have been a river of notable\r\npretensions, stepped ashore upon this stone, and exclaimed, with regal\r\nfacility of evil rhyme:—\r\n\r\n                “Here I stand, and here I rest,\r\n                And this place shall be called Totnes!”\r\n\r\nWhy the name should be appropriate to the circumstances, we might vainly\r\nstrive to guess, did not Westcote and Risdon inform us that it was\r\nintended to represent _Tout à l’aise_! We need not be ashamed of\r\nadopting their incredulity, and of doubting with them whether Brutus\r\nspoke such good French, or, indeed, whether French was then spoken at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe stone itself affords no aid. All mystery departed when it was\r\nrecently lifted in the course of pavemental repairs, and found to be a\r\nboulder of no great dimensions, with a very modern-looking bone lying\r\nbelow. However, it is the “Brutus stone,” and I dare say will long be\r\nthe object of a certain amount of popular faith.[2]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  An old inhabitant of Totnes, named John Newland, states that he and\r\n  his father removed this stone from a well which they were digging\r\n  about sixty years ago, and deposited it in its present position. The\r\n  stone is precisely such a boulder as occurs in large numbers in the\r\n  deposit left by the Dart on the further margin of the alluvial flat or\r\n  “strath” at Totnes, and which is cut through by the tramroad to the\r\n  quay, near the railway station. Popular opinion is in favour of the\r\n  authenticity of the stone, but it can hardly have been the “rock”\r\n  referred to by Prince, already cited, “towards the lower end of the\r\n  town”; and for my own part, I am inclined to regard it as the “modern\r\n  antique” Newland’s account would make it, to which the old tradition\r\n  has been transferred. Moreover, there is yet current a local tradition\r\n  that Brutus landed at Warland. If this is not held to dispose of the\r\n  present “Brutus stone,” it certainly indicates an important divergence\r\n  of authorities.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBut, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth himself, Totnes town could not\r\nhave been intended by him as the scene of the landing of Brutus. It was\r\nwhen Brutus was “holding a solemn festival to the gods, in the port\r\nwhere they had at first landed,” that he and his followers were attacked\r\nby Goemagot and his party. There it was that Goemagot and Corinæus had\r\nthat famous wrestling bout, which ended in Corinæus running with his\r\ngigantic foe to the next shore, and throwing him off a rock into the\r\nsea. There is no sea at Totnes, no tall craggy cliff; and for Corinæus\r\nto have run with his burden from Totnes to the nearest point of Start or\r\nTor Bay would have been a feat worthy even of a Hercules.\r\n\r\nWe are not surprised to find, therefore, that Totnes has her\r\nrivals—Dover, set up by the Kentish folk, and Plymouth,[3] each claiming\r\nto be the scene of the combat between Corinæus and Goemagot, and\r\nclaiming, therefore, incidentally, also to be the port in which Brutus\r\nlanded. I do not know that we can trace either tradition very far into\r\nantiquity. They do not occur in the chronicles, where, indeed, the very\r\nname of Plymouth is unknown. The earliest reference to that locality has\r\nbeen generally regarded as the Saxon Tamarworth. I am not at all sure,\r\nhowever, that Plymouth is not intended by Geoffrey’s “Hamo’s Port,”\r\nwhich he assumes to be Southampton. Geoffrey, indeed, says that\r\nSouthampton obtained the “ham” in its name from a crafty Roman named\r\nHamo, killed there by Arviragus; but if the identification is no better\r\nthan the etymology, we may dismiss it altogether. On the other hand, the\r\nname of the estuary of the Tamar is still the Hamoaze—a curious\r\ncoincidence, if it goes no further. There is nothing in the story of\r\nHamo itself to indicate Southampton or preclude Plymouth; only a few\r\nreferences to Hamo’s Port occur in Geoffrey. One of these, where Belinas\r\nis described as making a highway “over the breadth of the kingdom” from\r\nMenevia to Hamo’s Port, may rather seem to point to Southampton; but\r\nthere is no positive identification, even if we assume the story to be\r\ntrue. Again, “Maximian the senator,” when invited into Britain by\r\nCaradoc, Duke of Cornwall, to be King of Britain, lands at Hamo’s Port;\r\nand here the inference would rather be that it was on Cornish territory.\r\nAnd so when Hoel sent 15,000 Armoricans to the help of Arthur, it was at\r\nHamo’s Port they landed. It was from Hamo’s Port that Arthur is said to\r\nhave set sail on his expedition against the Romans—a fabulous story,\r\nindeed, but still helping to indicate the commodiousness and importance\r\nof the harbour intended. It was at Hamo’s Port that Brian, nephew of\r\nCadwalla, landed on his mission to kill the magician of Edwin the King,\r\nwho dwelt at York, lest this magician might inform Edwin of Cadwalla’s\r\ncoming to the relief of the British. After he had killed Pellitus, Brian\r\ncalled the Britons together at Exeter; and it would be fair to infer\r\nthat the place where he landed was likely to be one where the Britons\r\nhad some strength. Here, again, whatever we may make of the history, it\r\nis Hamo’s Port that is the fitting centre of national life; and it is\r\nthe Hamoaze that best suits the reference.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Bridport also, on the ground of its etymology, Brute-port (!).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis legend of Brute the Trojan was firmly believed in, and associated\r\nwith these Western shores, by the leading intellects of the Elizabethan\r\nday. Spenser refers to it in his:—\r\n\r\n               That well can witness yet unto this day\r\n               The Western Hogh besprinkled with the Gore\r\n               Of mighty Goemot.\r\n\r\nDrayton verifies the legend in his _Polyolbion_, and tells us how—\r\n\r\n          Upon that loftie place at Plimmouth, call’d the Hoe,\r\n          Those mightie Wrastlers met;\r\n\r\nand how that Gogmagog was by Corin—\r\n\r\n     Pitcht head-long from the hill; as when a man doth throw\r\n     An Axtree that with sleight deliurd from the Foe\r\n     Roots up the yeelding earth, so that his violent fall,\r\n     Strooke Neptune with such strength, as shouldred him withall;\r\n     That where the monstrous waues like mountaines late did stand,\r\n     They leapt out of the place, and left the bared sand\r\n     To gaze vpon wide heauen.\r\n\r\nAnd this article of faith had then long been popular. Carew, in his\r\n_Survey of Cornwall_, says: “Moreover, vpon the Hawe at Plymmouth, there\r\nis cut out in ground the pourtrayture of two men, the one bigger, the\r\none lesser, with clubbes in their hands (whom they terme Gogmagog), and\r\n(as I have learned) it is renewed by order of the Townesmen when cause\r\nrequireth, which should inferre the same to be a monument of some\r\nmoment.” Westcote, writing some half a century later, states of the\r\nHoe—“in the side whereof is cut the portraiture of two men of the\r\nlargest volume, yet the one surpassing the other every way; these they\r\nname to be Corinæus and Gogmagog.” And there these figures remained\r\nuntil the Citadel was built in 1671—a remarkable witness of the local\r\nbelief that Plymouth had played a prominent part in the affairs of\r\nBrutus and his fellows.\r\n\r\nWe know when these figures ceased to be. Can we form any idea as to when\r\nthey originated? Their earliest extant mention occurs in the Receiver’s\r\nAccounts of the borough of Plymouth, under date 1494–5:—\r\n\r\n  It. paid to Cotewyll for y^e renewying of y^e pyctur of Gogmagog a pon\r\n  y^e howe. vij^{d.}\r\n\r\nPrevious to this date there only remain complete accounts of two\r\nyears—those for 1493–4 and those for 1486—with a few fragmentary\r\nentries; and as the Gogmagog did not come to be “renewed” every year,\r\nthere are no conclusions to be drawn from the absence of earlier\r\nnotices. The next entry is in 1500–1, when 8_d._ was paid for “makying\r\nclene of gogmagog.” In 1514–15, John Lucas, sergeant, had the like sum\r\nfor “cuttyng of Gogmagog”; and in the following year we read of its “new\r\ndyggyng.” In 1526–7, the entry runs: “Itm p^{d.} for Clensying and\r\nryddyng of gogmagog a pon ye howe viij^{d.}”; and about this time it was\r\nrenewed almost yearly. In 1541–2, the entry is: “Itm p^{d.} to William\r\nHawkyns, baker (evidently to distinguish him from William Hawkyns,\r\nfather of Sir John), for cuttynge of Gogmagog the pycture of the Gyaunt\r\nat hawe viij.” In 1566–7, the price had gone up to twenty pence.\r\nProbably this ancient monument had been neglected for some years before\r\nthe last vestiges disappeared in 1671. It is not likely to have been\r\nrenewed under the Commonwealth, nor do I think it was revived under the\r\nRestoration. It is noteworthy that the official entries apparently refer\r\nto one figure only, though we know from Carew and Westcote that there\r\nwere two. Fourpence a day was about an average wage for labourers at\r\nPlymouth in the opening years of the sixteenth century, so that the\r\n“pyctur” probably took about two days to cleanse, and therefore must,\r\nindeed, have been of gigantic dimensions.\r\n\r\nSome years ago I threw out the suggestion that as Geoffrey made no\r\nallusion to these figures, “it must be assumed either that he did not\r\nknow of their existence, or that they did not then exist.” Believing the\r\nlatter the more reasonable conclusion, I suggested, further, “that they\r\nwere first cut in the latter half of the twelfth century, soon after\r\nGeoffrey’s chronicle became current, or not long subsequently; unless,\r\nas is possible, they had a different origin, and were associated with\r\nthe wrestling story in later days.” Finally, I put forward the\r\nhypothesis, “that the legend, in the first place, did refer to something\r\nthat occurred in the fifth century at or near the Hoe, and with which\r\nthe Armorican allies, whom Ambrosius called to his aid about the year\r\n438, were associated; that the Armoricans, on their return to Brittany,\r\nbetween the fifth and twelfth centuries, under the mingled influence of\r\nhalf-understood classical history and of religious sentiment working\r\nthrough the romantic mind, it developed into the full-blown myth of\r\nBrutus the Trojan; and that when it returned to England, and was made\r\nknown under the auspices of Geoffrey of Monmouth, the Plymouthians of\r\nthat day, to perpetuate the memory of what they undoubtedly believed to\r\nbe sterling fact, cut the figures of the two champions on the greensward\r\nof the Hoe.”\r\n\r\nI am not inclined now to adopt this hypothesis so broadly as it was then\r\nsuggested. Probably the story did take shape in Brittany in some such\r\nfashion, but I now believe we must look far beyond the fifth century for\r\nits origin. There seems, however, little reason to doubt that the\r\n“Brutus stone” of Totnes and the Gogmagog of Plymouth originated, like\r\nthe Gog and Magog of London City, in the popularity of Geoffrey’s book.\r\nThe name, of course, linked Totnes with the legend, but we have\r\nabsolutely no knowledge whatever of the reason why Plymouth (any more\r\nthan Dover) came into the story. Dover, indeed, has no case\r\nwhat-ever—not even a “Gogmagog.”\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the claims of Totnes?\r\n\r\nNow, as to Totnes, it is important, in the first place, to observe that\r\nin all the early works, Totnes is generally alluded to as the name of a\r\ndistrict, and not of a town. For example, in the story of Brutus, as\r\ngiven by Geoffrey of Monmouth, his hero “set sail with a fair wind\r\ntowards the promised island, and arrived on the coast of Totnes.”\r\nNennius does not mention any place of debarkation. Geoffrey makes\r\nVespasian arrive at the shore of Totnes, and, in quoting Merlin’s\r\nprophecy to Vortigern concerning his own fate, says of the threatened\r\ninvasion of Aurelius Ambrosius and Uther Pendragon, “to-morrow they will\r\nbe on the shore of Totnes.” Later in the same chronicle, the Saxons whom\r\nArthur had allowed to depart “tacked about again towards Britain, and\r\nwent on shore at Totnes.” Though the town seems rather to be indicated\r\nhere, it is not necessarily so.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is certain that we are to understand the landing to have\r\ntaken place somewhere upon the south coast, for the invaders made an\r\n“utter devastation of the country as far as the Severn sea.” Constantine\r\nis said to have landed at the port of Totnes, which again may mean a\r\nplace so called, or the principal harbour of a district of that name. It\r\nis clear, then, all things considered, that we are not dealing in these\r\nolder chronicles with the present Totnes, great as is its antiquity,\r\nthough the “Brut Tysilio” does go so far as to specify the place of\r\nConstantine’s landing as “Totnais in Loegria.”\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. T. Kerslake, of Bristol, who has applied himself with singular\r\nacumen to the unravelling of sundry knotty points of our ancient\r\nhistory, is inclined to hold that the Totnes of the chronicles was a\r\ndistinct place, and he has pointed out that the Welsh chronicles contain\r\n“early forms of the names of this favourite British port that has got to\r\nbe thus confounded with Totnes.” In the “Brut Tysilio,” for example, the\r\nplace of the landing of Brutus is called “Talnas” (at least, this is the\r\nprinted form given in the Myvyvian Archæology); “Brut Gr. ab. Arthur”\r\nreads “Totonys”; and in a third, the “Hafod Chronicle,” we have\r\n“Twtneis.” Mr. Kerslake, therefore, treats “Talnas” as the earliest form\r\nof the word, and thereon builds the hypothesis that “the name given by\r\nthe British writers to their port would resolve itself into ‘’t-aln-as’\r\nand if Christchurch Haven should be conceded to be Ptolemy’s estuary of\r\nAlaunus, it would also be the port called by the Britons ‘Aln’ or\r\n‘’t-Aln-as,’ from which Vespasian advanced up to Alauna Sylva, or Caer\r\nPensauelcoit—the City in the Head of the High Wood.”\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt, I think, that Mr. Kerslake is right in\r\nregarding Penselwood as the site of Caer Pensauelcoit, given as Exeter\r\nby Geoffrey of Monmouth, not apparently on the authority of his British\r\noriginal, but, as in other cases, for his own gloss; and thenceforward\r\ncherished most fondly as one of the worthiest memories of the\r\n“ever-faithful” city by its chief men and antiquaries. If it was at\r\nTotnes town, or in Torbay, into which some critics have expanded the\r\nidea of the “Totonesium littus,” that Vespasian landed immediately\r\nbefore his siege of “Kairpen-Huelgoit,” then there is considerable force\r\nin Geoffrey’s comment, “quæ Exonia vocatur.” If Penselwood, on the\r\nborders of Somerset, Dorset, and Wilts, were this “Primæval British\r\nMetropolis,” then we must give up the idea that Vespasian landed at\r\nTotnes town, or anywhere in its vicinity. However, it by no means\r\nfollows that there was such a place as Totnes in the Talnas sense, as\r\nlocalised by Mr. Kerslake. Talnas is the single exception, so far as I\r\nam aware, to an otherwise general concord of agreement in favour of\r\nTotnes, at a date when Totnes town had not yet risen into such\r\nprominence as to justify or explain its appropriation of this tradition.\r\nThe general sense of the language used when Totnes and the Totnes shore\r\nare mentioned, lead me, as I have already said, to the conclusion that\r\nit was rather the name of a district than of a town or port; and it was\r\nevidently understood in this sense by Higden, who in his Chronicle\r\nquotes the length of Britain as 800 miles,“a totonesie litore,” rendered\r\nby Trevisa, “frome the clyf of Totonesse,” which I take to be only\r\nanother form of expression for the Land’s End.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that what we may call the Older Totnes is really the\r\nancient name for the south-western promontory of England, and perhaps\r\nmay once have been a name for Britain itself, in which case we can\r\nunderstand somewhat of the motive which led early etymologists to derive\r\nBritain from Brute or Brutus. The myth may be so far true that an elder\r\nname was supplanted by that which has survived, and that it lingered\r\nlatest in this western promontory, perhaps as a name for the district\r\noccupied by the Kornu-British kingdom in its more extended form. Whether\r\nthe modern Totnes is nominally the successor of the ancient title, the\r\nnarrow area into which this vestige of far antiquity had shrunk, may be\r\ndoubtful; for the name is as capable of Teutonic derivation as of\r\nKeltic. In my _Notes on the Historical Connections of Devonshire\r\nPlace-names_, I pointed out that a Saxon derivation that “would fit\r\nTotnes town quite as well as any other would be from ‘Tot,’ an\r\n‘enclosure,’ and ‘ey,’ an ‘island’—Totaneys, allied to Tottenham, and\r\nassociated with the island by the bridge, one of the Dart’s most notable\r\nfeatures.” For the original Totnes I suggested: “Perhaps instead of\r\n‘ness,’ a ‘headland’ (Scandinavian), we should read ‘enys,’ an ‘island,’\r\nand Tot may be equivalent to the Dod or Dodi, which we have in the Dod\r\nof the well-known Cornish headland, the Dodman.... Then we may read\r\nToteneys the ‘projecting or prominent island’; or, if ‘Dod’ is read as\r\n‘rocky,’ the ‘rocky island.’” I am satisfied that it is somewhere in\r\nthis direction we have to look for the origin of the name, which would\r\nseem, however, to be corrupted from its earliest form when we first\r\nlight upon it, and which may, indeed, be a relic of the giant race whom\r\nthe followers of Brutus extirpated.\r\n\r\nThe last sentence may sound somewhat strange, but my enquiries into this\r\ncurious story have led me to attach more importance to it than at first\r\nsight it seemed to deserve. Stripped of the dress in which it was decked\r\nout by Geoffrey, improving on his predecessors; deprived of its false\r\nlustre of classicism; cleared from the religious associations of a later\r\nday—this myth of Brutus the Trojan loses its personality, but becomes\r\nthe traditionary record of the earliest invasion of this land by an\r\nhistoric people, who, in their assumed superiority, dubbed the less\r\ncultivated possessors of the soil whose rights they invaded “giants,”\r\nand extirpated them as speedily as they knew how.\r\n\r\nMoreover, though Totnes town has to surrender its mythical hero, it\r\npreserves a record of an elder name for this England of ours than either\r\nthe Britain of the later Kelts or the Albion of the Romans; and if that\r\nname be indeed a survival from these early times, makes certain what the\r\ngeneral aspect of the story renders highly probable—that it was into\r\nthis corner of Britain the pre-Keltic or Iberic inhabitants of our\r\nisland first entered, and that it was here their rude predecessors—who\r\nto the diminutive Turanians might indeed appear as “giants”—made their\r\nfinal stand, just as in later days the non-Aryan invaders had to fly\r\nbefore the Kelt, and the Kelt in turn before the Saxon, until the\r\ncorners of the island became the refuge not only of a gallant, but of a\r\nmingled race, with one language, one faith, and a common tradition.\r\n\r\nThus much, indeed, I think we may safely infer from the local\r\nassociations of the story, supported as that inference is by the yet\r\ncurrent traditions of the giant enemies of the Cornish folk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE ROYAL COURTENAYS.\r\n                    BY H. M. IMBERT-TERRY, F.R.L.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen in that incomparable romance, _Les Trois Mousquetaires_, the source\r\nand parent of every historical novel of to-day, the author, Alexandre\r\nDumas, wished to impute to the leader of his trinity of heroes the\r\npossession of a high and exalted chivalry, he called him Athos.\r\n\r\nProbably the intention was to institute a comparison between the lofty\r\nattributes of the character and the altitude of the celebrated Greek\r\nmountain. Possibly, however, the talented Frenchman may have bestowed\r\nthis title on the chief personage of his story because he, the author,\r\nconceived that no more fitting designation could be given to the\r\nembodiment of distinguished and aristocratic qualities than the actual\r\nname borne by the founder of one of the most illustrious families that\r\nhas adorned the brilliant roll of French nobility, has given Emperors to\r\nthe East, and subsequently established in this land of Devon a noble\r\nhouse which is inseparably connected with the traditions and history of\r\nthe county.\r\n\r\nIn the continuation of Aimon’s _History of France_, an ancient chronicle\r\nof the thirteenth century, it is stated that the Châtelain of Chateau\r\nRenard had a son, named Athos, who rendered himself famous by his deeds\r\nof daring, and, in the reign of King Robert of France—A.D.\r\n1020—fortified the town of Courtenay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Okehampton Castle, 1734.</sc>\r\n  (_From an Engraving by S. and N.

Buck, delinm et Sculp. 1734._\r\n\r\nFrom this castle, situated on a hill in the rich and wooded country\r\nwhich stretches over that district anciently called L’Isle de France,\r\nthe descendants of Athos took their title. The name of his wife, the\r\nmother of the race, is nowhere recorded, although Bouchet, the historian\r\nof the French branch of the Courtenay family, states that she was “une\r\ndame de condition”; and the truth of this statement is verified by the\r\nfact that in those days, when the prerogatives of birth were universally\r\nacknowledged, her progeny were considered fitting mates for the noblest\r\nin the kingdom.\r\n\r\nJocelyn de Courtenay, the son of Athos and his unnamed wife, married\r\ntwice: first, in the year 1060, Hildegarde, daughter of Geoffrey de\r\nFerole, Comte de Gastinois; second, Elizabeth, daughter of Guy, Seigneur\r\nde Montlehery, by whom he had three sons—Milo, Jocelyn, and Geoffry.\r\n\r\nAt this period of history, the countries of Europe were undergoing one\r\nof those strange religious convulsions which frequently occurred in the\r\nMiddle Ages. The passionate pilgrimage of Peter the Hermit drew motley\r\ncrowds of so-called Christians to the Holy Land. Wherever the small,\r\nmean monk of Picardy, seated on his ass, “pusillus, persona\r\ncontemptibilis et sponte fluens ei non deerat eloquium,” as William of\r\nTyre describes him, preached the holiness of the Cause and the shame to\r\nChristendom that the Sepulchre of the Saviour should remain in infidel\r\nhands, his earnestness and enthusiasm, if not his eloquence, made\r\nthousands of fervid converts.\r\n\r\nIn those days of lawlessness and violence, few men of rank but had the\r\nstain of blood-guiltiness upon their souls. The richer hoped to buy\r\nsalvation and release from their wrongdoings by founding abbeys and\r\nbestowing, out of their abundance, generous grants of land to maintain\r\nthe same; the poorer went pilgrimages, and purchased the promise of as\r\nmuch future happiness as their possessions would afford.\r\n\r\nBut to the fighting noble of the day, whatever means he may already have\r\ntaken to obtain the pardon of the Church, the call to arms by Pope Urban\r\nfor the defence of the Holy Land, proclaimed, as it was, with all the\r\nauthority of the Head of Christendom, endowed with all the plenitude of\r\nPapal indulgence, necessarily possessed a special attraction, for it\r\npromised him not only remission of his sins, but also the hope that the\r\nremission would be gained by exercising those very same deeds of\r\nviolence and rapine, the commission of which in his daily life had\r\nprobably brought him to believe that eternal punishment was his just\r\ndoom.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder, therefore, that knights and nobles in large numbers\r\nendeavoured thus to gain everlasting advantages. Among the French\r\nnobility who passed over to La Terre Sainte, Jocelyn II. de Courtenay is\r\nnumbered.\r\n\r\nThe principality of Edessa, a province so situated as not only to be\r\ndivided by the Euphrates, but by its position specially exposed to\r\nenemies who surrounded it on all sides, was then held by Baldwin de\r\nBruges, a renowned knight, cousin to Godfrey de Bouillon. Baldwin’s\r\nmother and the wife of Jocelyn, son of Athos, were sisters, their\r\nchildren consequently being cousins.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Archbishop of Tyre, the elder warrior gladly welcomed\r\nhis young kinsman, yielding to his charge those territories which lay\r\nfarthest from the enemy, but retaining under his personal supervision\r\nthe frontier, on which largely depended the safety of the Christian\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nBlessed with all the advantages a good administration can bestow, and\r\nprotected from an unwearying enemy, to a certain extent, by the river,\r\nthe country ruled by Jocelyn de Courtenay acquired such prosperity and\r\nopulence as to excite the envy of the neighbouring Christian Princes.\r\nIndeed, as all chroniclers show, when the overpowering personality of\r\nGodfrey de Bouillon was withdrawn, the promiscuous host which he led,\r\nrent by great diversity of interests, composed of many nations, lost the\r\nlittle cohesion it had once possessed, and rapidly fell apart.\r\n\r\nBaldwin succeeding to the throne of Jerusalem, his cousin held undivided\r\nsway over the whole province. For thirty years did the gallant Frenchman\r\ndefend his domains against the ever-returning infidel hordes, with\r\nvarying success—at times a conqueror, at times a captive, dying in a\r\nmanner befitting his life, for in his old age, weak with sickness,\r\nbroken with wounds, he caused himself to be carried before his troops as\r\nhe led them to succour their fellow-countrymen besieged by the Sultan of\r\nIconium.\r\n\r\nOn his advance, the terror his prowess inspired sufficed to force the\r\nenemy to retire, news of which reaching the ears of the dying warrior,\r\nhe gave thanks to God that the last moments of his life should be\r\nillumined with victory, and then immediately expired.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by Jocelyn, third of the name, the only son of his\r\nfirst wife, a sister of Levon, an Armenian notable.\r\n\r\nIt is to be suspected that the wisdom, energy, and endurance which so\r\nstrongly characterized the father, and by which the little state,\r\nthreatened with innumerable enemies, could alone be preserved, were, to\r\nsome extent, deficient in the son, the deterioration probably being\r\ncaused by the mixture of Asiatic blood in his veins.\r\n\r\nIn all contemporary records, the Pullani or Poulaines, progeny of Frank\r\nCrusaders and Syrian mothers, are spoken of with contempt and disdain,\r\nand although no lack of valour or even military qualities can be\r\nattributed to Jocelyn II., yet it is plain that the Eastern strain in\r\nhis descent rendered him unduly disposed towards the seductions of a\r\nluxurious life; leading him to prefer the pleasures and ease of\r\nresidence in the agreeable city of Turbessel to the constant care and\r\nhardships inseparable from an habitation in his fortified capital,\r\nEdessa.\r\n\r\nThis lack of vigilance on his own part naturally re-acted on his\r\nsubordinates, and led, as a logical consequence, to a serious diminution\r\nin the military spirit and power of the country. In addition, an\r\nembittered feud with Raynald, Prince of Antioch, deprived him of the\r\nonly ally who could, if well disposed, afford prompt and efficient aid.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when Zenghi, or Sanguine, as the name has been corrupted by\r\nthe Latin writers, leader of the Atabeks, with a vast host invaded the\r\ncity of Edessa, it fell into his hands before either the ruler or the\r\nneighbouring Christian Princes were prepared to march to its assistance.\r\n\r\nDefeated so often as to be without the means of efficient resistance to\r\nthe powerful invader, Jocelyn himself before long became the prisoner of\r\nsome wandering hordes. Carried a captive to Aleppo, he soon died,\r\ncrushed by the misery of his position and the unwholesomeness of his\r\nsurroundings, leaving one son, called by the same name as himself, and\r\ntwo daughters.\r\n\r\nBeatrice, his widow, for a while, with ability and courage, defended\r\nTurbessel against the attacks of Zenghi’s successor, Noureddin, but\r\nreceiving inadequate support from the King of Jerusalem, she yielded the\r\ntask of holding the country to the effeminate Greeks, and they proving\r\nincapable of the effort, the whole province, which from the time of the\r\nApostles had been the home and refuge of Christianity in the East, was\r\nirretrievably overrun by the infidel.\r\n\r\nJocelyn III., with his mother and sister, took refuge in Jerusalem,\r\nwhere, for more than twenty years, he led the existence inseparable from\r\nthe lot of those who supported the waning dominion of the Christians—one\r\nconstant struggle, not for supremacy, but for life. His fate is unknown:\r\nhistory has no record of him after the siege of Jerusalem, so it may\r\nwell be surmised that he shared the fate of the slain when the Holy City\r\nfell to the assault of the great Sultan Saladin.\r\n\r\nTwo daughters were the sole descendants of Jocelyn; consequently, with\r\nhim ended the House of the Courtenays of Edessa.\r\n\r\nBut while one branch of the parent stem had thus died off in less than\r\nninety years, the family tree itself flourished exceedingly, giving\r\ngreat promise of that luxuriance which, in after generations, blossomed\r\ninto Royal magnificence.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Edessa, the bulwark of Christianity in the East, caused the\r\nSecond Crusade. Again in the roll of those who took the Cross is to be\r\nfound the name of Courtenay, for among the followers of King Louis le\r\nJeune were numbered William and Reginald of that name, and also Peter de\r\nFrance, the King’s brother.\r\n\r\nWhen Jocelyn of Edessa, together with his younger brother, Geoffrey\r\nCourtenay, surnamed de Chapalu, sailed, in the year 1101, for La Terre\r\nSainte, the eldest son of the house, Milo de Courtenay, remained in\r\nFrance, succeeding, on the death of his father, to the family domains.\r\nHe married Ermengarde, daughter of Renaud, Comte de Nevers, and by her\r\nhad three sons—William, Reginald, and Jocelyn. Of the last, nothing is\r\nknown but the name. William, who as aforesaid took part in the Crusade,\r\ndied in the Holy Land, leaving, on the extinction of the Counts of\r\nEdessa and the death of Geoffrey de Chapalu, his uncle, Reginald, his\r\nyounger brother, sole heir to the name and possessions of his\r\nforefathers.\r\n\r\nIn those days, when transit was difficult and the social barriers\r\nbetween the noble and the roturier almost insurmountable, it was the\r\ncustom, well known to all who plunge into the intricacies of French\r\ngenealogy, and reasonable enough, considering the circumstances of the\r\ntimes, for the males of a family of rank to marry, hardly without\r\nexception, the daughters of their neighbours of like degree.\r\n\r\nLife was a very precarious commodity to a man of the eleventh and\r\ntwelfth centuries. He lived in an atmosphere of continuous warfare, and\r\nif by nature, mental or physical, he was disinclined for this turbulent\r\nexistence, the only refuge open to him lay in the celibate seclusion of\r\nthe cloister. It frequently occurred, therefore, that females inherited\r\npaternal estates.\r\n\r\nTo this cause may well be attributed the fact that the possessions of\r\nthe Courtenays had become largely augmented, for Reginald is described\r\nas Seigneur of Montargis, Chateau Renard, Champignelle, Tanlay, Charny,\r\nChantecoq, and several other seigneuries, all situated in the Pays de\r\nGastinois and the country round Sens, many of which, in the time of his\r\nprogenitors, were unmistakably the property of neighbouring families.\r\n\r\nThe possession of great wealth, at all periods of the world’s history,\r\nhas been held as a claim to consideration; and when such opulence is\r\ncombined with high rank and birth, the fortunate owner may well cherish\r\nlofty ambitions.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of what we call the Middle Ages, the coat armour borne\r\nby a warrior surely denoted his lineage and descent, for, unless assumed\r\nfor purposes of disguise, heraldic insignia were used as a means of\r\nshowing to which family an individual belonged—not, as now-a-days, to\r\nwhich family an individual wishes the world to think he belongs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those claims to nobility which are known to be possessed\r\nby Athos, the fact is also acknowledged that he and his descendants used\r\nthe arms attributed to the ancient counts of Boulogne—three torteaux or,\r\non a field gules—arms which were undoubtedly borne by Eustace de\r\nBouillon, when he and his illustrious brother Godfrey journeyed on the\r\nCrusade.\r\n\r\nIt may, therefore, well be believed that the ancestors of the Courtenays\r\ncame from the same stock as the even more ancient house of Boulogne; and\r\nit is easy to understand that the only daughter and heir female of\r\nReginald de Courtenay was considered a fitting mate for Peter de France,\r\nseventh son of King Louis le Gros.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the relations between the Crown and the great nobles of the\r\nkingdom rested far more on a basis of equality than the pretensions of\r\nthe monarch cared to allow.\r\n\r\nSismondi declares that the real domains of Louis VI. consisted only of\r\nfive towns, including Paris and Orleans, together with estates, probably\r\nlarge, in the immediate vicinity; the remainder of the country being\r\ndivided among the great nobles, some of whom possessed equal, if not\r\nmore, extensive territories than their titular Sovereigns.\r\n\r\nThe young Prince Peter having but little estate left him by his father,\r\nand no title—for he is always styled the “King’s son” or “the King’s\r\nbrother”—took to himself the name of Courtenay, and from him and his\r\nwife, Elizabeth, sprung that branch of the family which flourished in\r\nFrance for more than six hundred years. Five sons and six daughters\r\nissued from this union, the eldest daughter, Alix, marrying, as her\r\nsecond husband, Aimar, Comte d’Angouleme, by whom she had one daughter,\r\nElizabeth, who, in her turn, became the wife of John, and the mother of\r\nHenry III., both Kings of England.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the Eastern Empire which, having been conquered by the\r\nLatin knights errant remained in their power, for twelve years had been\r\nruled by Baldwin of Flanders and his brother, Henry, a wise and politic\r\nprince, upon whose death, in 1217, the male line of the House of\r\nFlanders became extinct.\r\n\r\nFrom respect to the laws of succession, the crown was thereupon offered\r\nto Peter de Courtenay, son of Elizabeth de Courtenay and Peter of\r\nFrance, who had married Yolande, daughter of the Count of Hainault, and\r\nsister to both the late Emperors, Baldwin and Henry. The proffered\r\nhonour, doubtless, was great, yet the accession to the Imperial purple\r\nproved the precursor of heavy calamities to the unfortunate Emperor and\r\nhis descendants. Peter de Courtenay, it is true, bore the reputation of\r\na valorous knight and a courageous warrior. He served with distinction\r\nin the Crusade against the Albigenses, prompted, perhaps, by a desire to\r\nmerit the forgiveness of the Church, whose servants in his own domain he\r\nhad, if the chroniclers are to be believed, treated with the haughty\r\nintolerance characteristic of the arrogant seigneur of the period.\r\n\r\nBut at that critical time in the history of the Eastern Empire, the\r\nwearer of the Imperial Crown required not only courage, but talents and\r\ndiplomacy of the highest degree, such as Peter neither possessed nor\r\nfound opportunity of acquiring.\r\n\r\nArriving at Rome in company with his wife, Yolande, and his children,\r\nPope Honorius, after some pressure, was induced to crown him and his\r\nconsort; but, as Gibbon hints, performed the ceremony in the Church of\r\nSt. Lawrence, without the walls, lest by the act itself any right of\r\nsovereignty over the ancient city should be bestowed or implied.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of a promise to the Venetians, the Emperor Peter, having\r\nfirst sent his wife and children by sea to Constantinople, directed his\r\nforces against the Kingdom of Epirus, then under the rule of Theodore\r\nComnenus. Failing in his object, he fell, either by force or fraud, into\r\nthe hands of the Greek despot, and died, by assassination or in prison,\r\nwithout having entered his Imperial dominions.\r\n\r\nWith a discretion rare, indeed, in those days, Philip, his eldest son,\r\nrefused the honour of the purple, contenting himself with the Marquisate\r\nof Namur, his paternal fief; whereupon Robert, the younger brother,\r\naccepted the burden of the crown, and having, with due precaution,\r\njourneyed to Constantinople, was there crowned by the Patriarch Matthew,\r\nwith all pomp and circumstance, in the Cathedral of Saint Sophia.\r\n\r\nBut in the grandeur of his coronation consisted the only splendour of\r\nhis reign. All historians combine in representing Robert as deficient in\r\nevery quality requisite for the high station he occupied and the\r\nnecessity of the realm he had been chosen to rule; even Bouchet,\r\nself-appointed laureate to La Maison Royale de Courtenay, after\r\ndescribing the death of the Emperor on his return journey from Rome,\r\nwhither he had gone to solicit against his own rebellious subjects the\r\nthunders of the Pope, is constrained to admit that to the weakness of\r\nthis ruler may justly be attributed the disgraces which occurred in the\r\nreign of his successor.\r\n\r\nRobert dying childless, the crown descended to his brother, Baldwin, the\r\ninfant son of Yolande, born during his father’s captivity. The\r\nimpossibility of an empire in the throes of dissolution being governed\r\nby a child of seven years, compelled the barons of the realm to invite\r\nJohn of Brienne, the old King of Jerusalem, to bring his wisdom and\r\nexperience to their aid; but the seeds of disintegration had too long\r\nbeen sown. Notwithstanding a two-fold victory against the invader, on\r\nthe death of the veteran in 1237, the Latin supremacy in the East well\r\nnigh vanished.\r\n\r\nThe youthful Baldwin de Courtenay, during the life of John of Brienne,\r\nvisited many European courts in the vain hope of obtaining aid, military\r\nor pecuniary, for the defence of his forlorn dominions, and in the\r\nsubsequent five and twenty years of his reign these visits were more\r\nthan once repeated, each time with less result, and though, in fruitless\r\nefforts to raise men and money, he alienated his own patrimony of Namur\r\nand Courtenay, although in desperation he sold the sacred treasures of\r\nhis capital—the Crown of Thorns and other relics reputed equally\r\nholy—yet his utmost efforts could in no wise avert the doom which\r\nthreatened the Empire, but only availed to postpone for a while the\r\nfinal catastrophe.\r\n\r\nAt last the determination of Michael Palæologus brought the struggle to\r\nan end. Constantinople was invested and taken by the Greeks, the last\r\nremnant of Latin sway, in the person of the Emperor Baldwin and his\r\nfamily, taking refuge on board the Venetian fleet, which lay anchored in\r\nthe Bosphorous.\r\n\r\nWith Baldwin and his son Philip, titular Emperor of Constantinople,\r\nended the elder branch of the Courtenay family, for the latter left one\r\ndaughter only, who married Charles of Valois, a prince aptly described\r\nas “son of a King, brother of a King, uncle to a King, and father to a\r\nKing, but yet himself no King.”\r\n\r\nThe elevation of three of its members to the Imperial throne undoubtedly\r\nconferred great honour on the House of Courtenay, but the after results\r\nmost adversely affected the surviving members. While other families\r\nconnected with the French monarchy increased in wealth and influence,\r\nthe severe struggles made by three generations to maintain their\r\nImperial dignity so impoverished the ancestral domains that the\r\nsuccessive holders, though undeniably of Royal descent and near\r\nrelationship to the reigning dynasty, were not esteemed, and could not\r\nobtain recognition of their claims to be considered as Princes of the\r\nBlood Royal. It is true, however, that much doubt exists as to whether\r\nin the early days of the French nobility, kinship with the King implied\r\nany superiority of rank over others nobly born.\r\n\r\nLe Comte Boulainvilliers, to whose family the Seigneurie of Courtenay,\r\nafter its alienation, had been given as a royal fief, declares, in his\r\n“Dissertation sur la Noblesse de France”: “The French knew nothing of\r\nPrinces among themselves; consanguinity (_parenté_) to Kings gave no\r\nrank the same as if descended in the male line. This is evident by the\r\nexamples of the Houses of Dreux, of Courtenay, and the junior branches\r\nof the House of Bourbon.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is quite apparent to all who read early French history that\r\nthe King exercised merely nominal authority over the nobility, and was\r\nconsidered but as a chief and leader among those of equal birth and\r\ndescent, though differing in degree. It cost King Louis VI. a vast deal\r\nof trouble to reduce the pretensions of the Seigneurs of Montlehery,\r\nwho, allied by marriage to the houses of Flanders and Courtenay,\r\nconceived themselves in all essentials to be equal to and independent of\r\ntheir titular monarch, while even more cogent testimony to the same\r\neffect, redolent also to a great degree of the atmosphere of the times,\r\nis borne by the subjoined letter from Thibaut, Comte de Champagne, to\r\nthe Abbot of St Denis, Governor of the Realm in the absence of the\r\nKing:—“This is to let you know that Renaud de Courtenay hath done great\r\ninjury to the King, ... for he hath seized on certain merchants that are\r\nthe King’s subjects, who have discharged their toll at Orleans and Sens,\r\nand hath stripped them of all their goods. It is, therefore, necessary,\r\nto order him in the King’s name, they be set at liberty and all that\r\nbelongs to them restored. In case he refuse ... and you be desirous to\r\nmarch an army against him, ... let me know, and I will send you aid.”\r\n\r\nAfter the extinction of the elder branch in the persons of the Emperor\r\nBaldwin and his son, the House of Courtenay became so divided that, in\r\nthe many ramifications of descent and consequent division of goods, the\r\nSeigneurs de Champignelles, de Tanlay, d’Arrablay, de Ferté Loupiere,\r\netc., lost their pride of place, and were undistinguishable from the\r\nremainder of the nobility, direct evidence of which is furnished by the\r\nfact that Bouchet, who certainly loses no opportunity of enhancing the\r\ngrandeur of the race, places over the arms of the Lord of D’Illier the\r\nnine-pointed coronet of a seigneur, and not, as on other occasions, the\r\ncrown, embellished with fleur-de-lys, which designated the Royal House\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nYet the right of the Courtenays to be considered of Royal blood is\r\nincontrovertible, testimony to it being borne by many deeds of partition\r\nand contracts of marriage to which members of the reigning family\r\naffixed their signatures, in each case describing themselves as\r\nrelations and cousins.\r\n\r\nMoreover, even in the nineteenth century, the head of the House of\r\nCourtenay received a summons to the funeral of Henri Dieudonné, Comte de\r\nChambord, Henri Cinq de France, as “notre parent et cousin.”\r\n\r\nFifteen years after the surviving members had lodged a final petition\r\nfor the restoration of their rights of blood, “by the eternal doom of\r\nFate’s decree,” the death of Charles Roger de Courtenay, the last male\r\nof the line, the controversy was closed; and thus what Gibbon calls the\r\nplaintive motto of the House: “Ubi lapsus, quid feci?” for the second\r\ntime in history received the endorsement of truth.\r\n\r\nBut while two branches of the race grew, flourished, and fell, a third\r\ndivision rose to rank and fortune in this island, becoming closely\r\nallied by links of property and title with Devon, the fairest shire in\r\nthe English land—links which the space of 750 years has strengthened,\r\nthe glamour of an historic name, the charm of many a noble nature, have\r\nrendered unbreakable.\r\n\r\nIn olden times, a nation made it a point of honour to claim descent from\r\nancestors who had participated in the siege of Troy. Fashions change. In\r\nthe twentieth century, if an individual rises to such eminence that he\r\nis elevated to the peerage, the world knows he must have had a father,\r\nand presumes he had a grandfather. When the presumption can be carried\r\nback for a generation or two, the basis of an ancient descent is so\r\nfirmly laid that a visit to the Heralds’ College will inevitably result\r\nin the discovery of a progenitor among those who fought with Norman\r\nWilliam at the battle of Senlac, undoubtedly, judging from their reputed\r\ndescendants, the most prolific band of warriors that ever peopled a\r\nconquered country.\r\n\r\nIn this, as in some other attributes, the Courtenays differ from the\r\nmodern aristocracy.\r\n\r\nThe first mention of a Courtenay in English history occurs in the reign\r\nof Henry II., and although Bouchet, with true prophetic instinct,\r\nconsiders it necessary to allege that a certain Guillaume de Courtenay\r\ncrossed over with the army of William of Normandy, the Battle Abbey roll\r\nof William Tailleur does not contain the name; but a “Cortney” may be\r\nfound in the probably inaccurate transcriptions of the same, which have\r\nbeen inserted in the Chronicles of Stowe and Holinshed. A certain degree\r\nof doubt, however, exists as to the identity of the first Courtenay\r\nmentioned in English records.\r\n\r\nDugdale, copying the register of the monks of Forde Abbey—a foundation\r\nwhich benefited largely by the munificence of the family, and, as long\r\nas the spring flowed, lost no opportunity of gratifying their ancestral\r\npride—declares that the founder of the name in this country was\r\nReginald, a son of Florus, younger son of Lewis le Gross, King of\r\nFrance, who assumed the name of Courtenay from his mother, the heir\r\nfemale of that family.\r\n\r\nHistory is silent as to whether Peter, seventh son of Louis le Gros,\r\never bore the designation of Florus; but it is undoubtedly proved by\r\nBouchet and others that the said Peter married a daughter of Reginald de\r\nCourtenay, and enjoying her possessions, called himself by the title of\r\nher seigneurie. It is also fairly assured that the offspring of this\r\nnoble couple did not number among them any son of the name of Reginald,\r\nand the preponderance of authority seems to show that the Reginald,\r\nfriend of Queen Alienore of Aquitaine, who, being divorced from King\r\nLouis, afterwards married Henry of England, was probably the father of\r\nthat Elizabeth de Courtenay who became allied with the Royal family of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nOn many occasions a de Courtenay is mentioned as accompanying Henry on\r\nhis travels; and in the year 1167, Roger de Hoveden records that\r\n“Reginald de Curteney” witnessed a treaty of peace between Henry II. of\r\nEngland and Roderick, King of Connaught.\r\n\r\nFor services rendered to the State, Henry, in exercise of his\r\nprerogative, gave as wards to Reginald de Courtenay, probably the one\r\naforesaid, the two daughters of Matilda, herself daughter of Randolph\r\nAvenel.\r\n\r\nReginald immediately married the elder, Hawise, and bestowed her\r\nhalf-sister, Maude, on a William de Courtenay, possibly his son,\r\nprobably, as Cleveland thinks, his brother.\r\n\r\nHawise, as sole heiress to her father, Robert d’Abrincis, and descended\r\nfrom Baldwin de Brionis, a valorous Norman knight, inherited large\r\nestates in the West of England—the Barony of Okehampton, the Shrievalty\r\nof Devonshire, the custody of the Castle of Exeter, and the title of\r\nVicecomes or Viscount; both dignities and land, as was the custom in\r\nthose days, being enjoyed, “jure uxoris,” by her husband, Reginald de\r\nCourtenay, passed to the child of their marriage, Robert, who still\r\nfurther augmented the position of the family by marrying in his turn\r\nMary, younger daughter of William de Redvers or Rivers, sixth Earl of\r\nDevon, through whom the House of Courtenay finally obtained the title\r\nwhich they retain to this day.\r\n\r\nThe policy of Henry III. deprived Robert de Courtenay of the Viscounty\r\nof Devon and the custody of Exeter Castle, but the Barony of Okehampton\r\nstill remained in the line, being successively held by John and Henry,\r\nson and grandson of the said Robert.\r\n\r\nIn 1262, by the failure of heirs male, Isabella, daughter of Baldwin,\r\nseventh Earl, and his wife, Amicia, became Countess of Devonshire. This\r\nmasterful lady married William de Fortibus, Earl of Albemarle, and,\r\nsurviving her husband and children for more than thirty years, exercised\r\ndespotic sway over the wide domains belonging to her. She erected a weir\r\nacross the River Exe, even now called Countess Weir, for the benefit, as\r\nshe declared, of her mills situated on both banks, though the citizens\r\nof Exeter were of different opinion, and on their oaths did aver that\r\nthe Countess had “made a great Purpresture or Nusance ... to the\r\nAnnoyance, Hurt and Damage of the said City.”\r\n\r\nAt her death, in 1292, the Earldom of Devon reverted to Sir Hugh\r\nCourtenay, second of the name, Baron of Okehampton, through his\r\ngreat-grandmother, Mary de Rivers, daughter of William de Ripariis,\r\nRedvers or Rivers, sixth Earl.\r\n\r\nSome forty years after the death of his predecessor, Sir Hugh was\r\nsummoned by writ, without any further creation, to take his seat as\r\nEarl, but before then he participated in many Parliaments as a Baron,\r\nboth Stowe and Holinshed alleging that he was one of the two Lords of\r\nthat rank who carried a solemn message to King Edward II., demanding\r\nfrom him the abdication of the throne.\r\n\r\nChiefly by means of judicious matrimonial alliances, the first members\r\nof the English Courtenays added largely to their rank and possessions.\r\n\r\nFollowing the good example, Hugh, third of the name and second Earl,\r\nwedded, in 1325, Margaret, daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of\r\nHereford, Lord High Constable of England, by her obtaining that appanage\r\nassociated so intimately with the Courtenay name as known in their own\r\ncounty, the beautiful castle and demesne of Powderham. Earl Hugh\r\nassigned this residence and estate to his younger son, Philip, from whom\r\nis descended the present branch of the family.\r\n\r\nHigh in rank, possessed of great territory, honoured in the council,\r\nforemost in the fray, for a hundred and fifty years the Courtenays of\r\nDevon occupied a great place in English history. They took part in the\r\nbattles of Halidon Hill, Creçy, the siege of Rouen, the triumphal entry\r\ninto Paris; as Admirals of the West, repelled invasion; as Governors of\r\nthe County, exercised extensive jurisdiction; and in their just pride of\r\nstation, contended with the Earls of Arundel as to who should take\r\nprecedence as premier Peer in the degree which they held.\r\n\r\nTheir functions, when acting as rulers of the county, were varied, for\r\nit is stated that in 1383 a command was issued to them by the King,\r\nordering the punishment of “certain malefactors and troublers of our\r\npeace ... come lately to Topsham and by force of arms have taken Peter\r\nHill, a certain messenger of the Venerable Father, William, Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, and with no small cruelty and threatening compelled him\r\nto eat the wax of a certain seal of the said Archbishop.”\r\n\r\nThis William, son of Hugh, second Earl, at first Bishop of London,\r\nafterwards raised to the archiepiscopal see of Canterbury, possessed so\r\nfully the hereditary courage of his opinions that he not only resolutely\r\nopposed the weighty influence of the Duke of Lancaster and Lord Percy of\r\nNorthumberland, when exercised by them in favour of John Wicliffe, but\r\nalso as Adam, Archdeacon of Usk, pathetically declares: “Eciam a facie\r\nistius regis Ricardi, ille vir perfectissimus Willelmus Cantuariensis\r\nArchiepiscopus quia hujus modi taxe resistere volens.” The strength of\r\nthe superlative epithet is justified by the said tax having been levied\r\nsolely against the clergy.\r\n\r\nBut the prosperity of the Courtenays, as of most other noble families in\r\nEngland, was rudely disturbed by the outbreak of civil strife—the Wars\r\nof the Roses. Supporting strongly the House of Lancaster, they shared in\r\nundue proportions the calamities which befel that party, three\r\nsuccessive Earls of Devon, the sons of Thomas, fifth in title, giving\r\ntheir lives for the cause they supported. Thomas, the elder of the\r\nthree, taken at Towton, was soon after executed, as historians say, to\r\nappease the ghost of the Duke of York. A few years later, Henry, his\r\nbrother, met the same fate; while John, the youngest, fell in the\r\ndisastrous battle of Tewkesbury, the great estates of the family being\r\nescheated by the King.\r\n\r\nYet once more, with the triumph of Henry VII., the fortunes of the\r\nancient house revived. The King annulled the attainder and restored the\r\nancestral domains to the faithful noble who had followed him into exile\r\nand fought by his side at Bosworth Field, subsequently sanctioning also\r\nthe marriage of the eldest son, Sir William Courtenay, with Katherine,\r\nthe younger daughter of the late King Edward IV.; though this royal\r\nalliance, as was often the case in such connections, only led to\r\nsuspicion on the part of the reigning monarch and calamity to the\r\naspiring bridegroom.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding reign, Henry, the child of this marriage, stood high\r\nin the favour of the monarch. As the boon companion of his cousin the\r\nKing, he tilted with him at Greenwich; as his brother-in-arms, he fought\r\nat the Battle of the Spurs; in the office of Lord High Steward, he\r\npresided over the trial of those persons who had fallen under the Royal\r\ndispleasure; and finally the honour of a Marquisate was bestowed, and\r\nHenry, seventh Earl of Devon, became the first Marquis of Exeter.\r\n\r\nBut the friendship of Henry VIII. was almost as deadly as his enmity.\r\nAccused of treason, neither personal virtues nor high connections\r\navailed anything, and so the Marquis of Exeter was arrested, tried, and\r\nexecuted. Hume, in this connection, remarks: “We know little concerning\r\nthe justice or iniquity of the sentence pronounced against these men: we\r\nonly know that the condemnation of a man who was at that time prosecuted\r\nby the court forms no presumption of his guilt”; but with characteristic\r\nambiguity he continues: “Though ... we may presume that sufficient\r\nevidence was produced against the Marquis of Exeter and his associates.”\r\n\r\nIn the light of present knowledge, it is not difficult to conjecture the\r\ncauses of this unfortunate nobleman’s downfall. There were two actions\r\nHenry VIII. never forgave: Failure to obey his wishes, tantamount to\r\ndisobedience to his commands; and friendship, or even tolerance, towards\r\nthose whom he chose to consider his enemies.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that Henry Courtenay committed the former as well\r\nas the latter form of “lèse majesté.” A letter from Sir Thomas More to\r\nCardinal Wolsey is still extant, in which he writes:—“And as touching\r\nthe ouverture made by my Lord Shevers for the marriage of my Lord of\r\nDevonshire the King is well content and as me seemyth very glad of the\r\nmotion, wherein he requireth your Grace that it may lyke you to call my\r\nLord of Devonshire to your Grace and to advise him secretly to forbere\r\nany further treate of marriage with my Lord Mountjoy.”\r\n\r\nNow, in 1526, Henry, Marquis of Exeter, married, as his second wife,\r\nGertrude, daughter of Lord Mountjoy, as this letter shows in opposition\r\nto the wishes of the King; and although, truly, the matter cannot in any\r\nway be considered of importance, yet the fact that the lady was a strong\r\nsupporter of the ancient Church, taken in conjunction with the jealousy\r\nobviously shown by Henry towards the power and authority exercised in\r\nthe West Country by all who bore the Courtenay name, may well have had\r\nan influence over the fate of the unfortunate nobleman.\r\n\r\nThe actual charge, in the State Trial, alleged complicity with the\r\ndesigns of Cardinal Pole and a desire to deprive the King of his\r\nprerogatives. At this period of his reign, the one great object of\r\nHenry’s life was to assert his supremacy over the English Church—that\r\nchurch in whose services and welfare he showed such deep interest, not\r\nonly by the extreme frequency with which he celebrated the marriage\r\nceremony, but also by the tenacious affection he displayed for her\r\ntemporal possessions.\r\n\r\nReginald Pole, at one time Dean of Exeter, born of a royal stock, allied\r\nwith many noble English houses, a Cardinal, and deep in the councils of\r\nthe Pope, was an unsparing opponent of Henry’s aspirations; so if, as\r\nBurnet says, “There were very severe invectives printed at Rome against\r\nKing Henry, in which there were nothing omitted which could make him\r\nappear as the blackest of tyrants, ... and Cardinal Pole’s style was\r\nknown in some of them,” even a kindly expression, much less a spirit of\r\nfriendliness towards the author of these attacks would be amply\r\nsufficient to draw on anyone, be he gentle or simple, the wrath of\r\nHenry, who “never spared man in his anger, or woman in his lust.”\r\n\r\nTherefore, as Wriothesley, in his Chronicle, relates: “The third of the\r\nsame month, the Lord Henry Courtney, Marquis of Exceter and Earle of\r\nDevonshire, and the Kinge’s neare kinsman, was arraigned at Westminster\r\nHall ... and there condempned to death, for treason against the Kinge by\r\nthe counsaille of Raynold Poole, Cardinall ... which pretended to have\r\nenhaunsed the Bishop of Rome’s usurped authority againe, lyke traitors\r\nto God and their Prince.”\r\n\r\nThe same strain of royal blood, breeding jealousy and mistrust, which\r\nhad caused the imprisonment of the grandfather and the death of the\r\nfather, inflicted also heavy penalties on the son. Edward, only child of\r\nHenry and Gertrude Courtenay, though but twelve years old at the date of\r\nhis father’s execution, was then committed to the Tower, and there\r\nremained close prisoner for fifteen years.\r\n\r\nReleased by Mary on her first regal entry into London, restored to his\r\nhereditary titles and property, endowed, moreover, with ample bodily and\r\nmany mental charms, the youthful Earl of Devonshire rapidly rose into\r\nfavour, and at one time was even considered as a fitting aspirant for\r\nthe hand of the Queen.\r\n\r\nBut to a young man of twenty-seven, the greater part of whose life had\r\nbeen spent amid the gloom and seclusion of a State prison, with only\r\nsuch amusements as the translation of Italian theological treatises\r\ncould afford, or other similar exercises, whether physical or mental, as\r\nthe gaoler would allow, the freedom of the outer world presented greater\r\ntemptations than his untrained nature could resist. Yielding to the\r\ndissipations of the court and, so ’tis said, the more sordid pleasures\r\nof the town, Edward Courtenay sacrificed to the enjoyment of the moment\r\nthe opportunities which were offered him of gratifying splendid\r\nambitions, and, too high placed to be disregarded, became, as his\r\nprogenitors before him, an object of mistrust and suspicion to the\r\noccupant of the throne.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate youth has been accused not only of ingratitude to his\r\nroyal benefactress by making secret advances to her sister, the Princess\r\nElizabeth, but also of the serious offence of disloyalty and treason\r\ntowards the monarch. But though, indeed, he may have committed the\r\nformer mistake, a critical examination of the evidence produced clears\r\nhim of knowing and wilful participation in any of the serious plots\r\nwhich the proposed marriage of the Queen with Philip of Spain had\r\naroused among her subjects. Sir Thomas Wyat unreservedly absolved\r\nCourtenay from all knowledge of his rising, and the leniency with which\r\nMary, little given to clemency, extended towards the Earl shows that\r\nshe, at least, believed in his innocence.\r\n\r\nProbably the truest aspect of the case is shown by Burnet, who declares,\r\nwhen writing of the harsh treatment dealt to Elizabeth by her royal\r\nsister: “Others suggest a more secret reason for this dispute. The new\r\nEarl of Devonshire was much in the Queen’s favour, so that it was\r\nthought that she had some inclination to marry him, but he, either not\r\npresuming so high or having an aversion to her and an inclination to her\r\nsister, who of that moderate share of beauty which was between them had\r\nmuch the better of her and was nineteen years younger, made his\r\naddresses with more than ordinary concern to the Lady Elizabeth, and\r\nthis did bring them both into trouble.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\n          _From the original portrait by Sir Antonio More, at\r\n               Woburn._]     [_Engraved by T. Chambars._\r\n                 EDWARD COURTENAY, EARL OF DEVONSHIRE.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is plain enough that this young man, little older and assuredly not\r\nmore experienced than a boy, was a tool in the hands of those astute\r\nintriguers, de Noailles and Simon Renard, the French and Spanish\r\nambassadors. The one, strenuously opposing the Spanish marriage, the\r\nother, equally determined in his advocacy of the alliance, united in\r\nusing the innocent Earl of Devonshire as a factor in their game, with\r\ndisastrous results to the unfortunate victim.\r\n\r\nAdvised to remove himself far from the scene of those intrigues which\r\nhad caught him in their net, Edward Courtenay departed for the Continent\r\nwith the declared intention of travelling to distant lands, even to\r\nConstantinople. That he had no consciousness of having committed a great\r\noffence is evident from his correspondence; for while frequently\r\nexpressing the hope that he may soon be home again, he asks a friend to\r\ngive him a buck and some does, so that his park may be stocked with\r\ndeer, and gleefully relates that the Emperor and King Philip had\r\nreceived him kindly. But his health is not good. He suffers, so he\r\nwrites, from a disease in his hip from cold; there is, also, much plague\r\nabout; and then no more is heard until the news arrives from Peter\r\nVannes, the English ambassador to the Venetian Republic, who was staying\r\nat Padua, announcing that Edward, Earl of Devonshire, had died in that\r\ncity, on September 18th, 1556. _Ubi lapsus, quid feci?_\r\n\r\nNoble and honoured in degree, gifted with many admirable and amiable\r\nqualities, the fairest prospects open before them, yet, one after the\r\nother, successive Earls of Devon, like their even more exalted\r\nancestors, perished in sorrow and adversity, until, as was generally\r\nbelieved, their ancient title became extinct.\r\n\r\nYet, far away in the West Country, beneath the oaks of Powderham, while\r\nthe elder branches dropped or were snapped off, the descendants of Sir\r\nPhilip Courtenay, youngest son of Hugh, second Earl of Devon, lived and\r\nthrived, gaining among their own people a love and devotion which has\r\nendured the strain of centuries and the many vicissitudes of fortune.\r\n\r\nThrough the course of years the Courtenays of Powderham followed the\r\nexample of their greater kinsmen, taking part in events of national\r\nimportance, bearing themselves with distinction against the foreign foe;\r\nwith hereditary courage and self-denial opposing the usurper, Richard of\r\nGloucester, and, in defeat as well as in victory, supporting the cause\r\nof Henry VII.\r\n\r\nBut in all things, great or small, they essentially were Devonshire\r\nleaders of Devonshire men—living among their own people, beloved and\r\nrespected by them.\r\n\r\nPeter Courtenay, Bishop of Exeter in 1437, expended his energy and\r\nsubstance in maintaining and improving the Cathedral, and to this day\r\nthe great bell which he hung in the north tower is called by his name,\r\nGreat Peter.\r\n\r\nMany a Devonshire Courtenay sat as Knight of the Shire for his native\r\nCounty; others of the family filled the office of Sheriff; and thus for\r\n340 years this branch of the house did its duty punctually and well,\r\nearning fresh honours and new titles in the place of those which lay in\r\nabeyance.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Edward, eighth Earl, in 1556, at Padua, the Courtenays\r\nof Powderham were represented by Sir William Courtenay, who died at the\r\nsiege of St. Quintin, a few months after the decease of his noble\r\nkinsman, his son and successor, also called William, being but four\r\nyears old at the time.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the tidings of the death of the head of the house were\r\nlong in travelling from Italy to distant Devonshire. It may be that none\r\nof the living members of the family were cognizant of the facts of the\r\ncase; but whatever the reasons, for 260 years the Earldom of Devon was\r\nregarded as lapsed, and no successor claimed its honour and dignity,\r\nthough some indications may, indeed, be found, both in written records\r\nand the behaviour of individuals, of a belief that the title, though\r\nlatent, was not extinct.\r\n\r\nGibbon, who himself has conferred a great and undying honour on the\r\nfamily by devoting, in his monumental work, a whole chapter to the\r\nhistory of the Courtenays, uses this significant expression: “His\r\npersonal honours as if they had been legally extinct”; and in 1660, when\r\nCharles II. offered the dignity of a Baronetcy to the then Sir William\r\nCourtenay, it was, as Cleveland relates, refused, “he not affecting that\r\ntitle because he thought greater of right belonged to him. Indeed, the\r\npatent of Baronetcy was never taken out, although his successors were\r\nalways styled as such.”\r\n\r\nIt is possible, however, that this refusal may have been due to the\r\nnatural irritation felt by the head of a great family at seeing his\r\nhereditary and ancestral honours conferred on others; for in 1602, James\r\nI. created Charles Blunt, Lord Mountjoy, Earl of Devonshire, and on his\r\ndecease, six years later, gave the same title to William Cavendish, in\r\nwhose line it remained until changed to a Dukedom.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of William III., an offer of an English Barony was made to\r\nthe head of the Courtenays, and again refused; but in 1762, the many\r\nservices of Sir William Courtenay, eighth of the name, merited a higher\r\nhonour, and he, accepting a Peerage, took his seat in the House of Lords\r\nas Viscount Courtenay of Powderham Castle.\r\n\r\nOnly surviving his elevation some six months, he was succeeded by his\r\nson, who, marrying a lady of less exalted lineage than himself, became\r\nthe parent of one son and thirteen daughters.\r\n\r\nThis only son and heir, the tenth in thirteen generations who\r\nsuccessively bore the name of William, on the advice, it is said, of\r\nthat distinguished lawyer, Mr. Pepys, afterwards Lord Chancellor and\r\nfirst Earl of Cottenham, in 1830 asserted, by petition to Parliament,\r\nhis right to the ancient Earldom of Devon. The grounds of the claim were\r\nas follows: When, in the year 1553, Sir Edward Courtenay, son of Henry,\r\nMarquis of Exeter and Earl of Devonshire, attainted and executed by\r\nHenry VIII., after having suffered a long confinement in the Tower,\r\nobtained from Queen Mary his release, she annulled the attainder, and\r\ncreated him, by special patent, “to hold the title and dignity of Earl\r\nof Devon with the said honours and pre-eminence thereunto belonging, to\r\nthe aforesaid Edward and his _heir male for ever_” (“prefato Edwardo et\r\nheredibus suis masculis imperpetuum”). And this phrase is again repeated\r\nlater: “Do grant to the aforesaid now Earl that he and his _heirs male_\r\nmay enjoy ... the same pre-eminence as any of the ancestors of the said\r\nEarl being heretofore Earl of Devon may have enjoyed.”\r\n\r\nWith great lucidity and deep knowledge of the subject, Mr. Pepys\r\nmaintained that, whereas in the majority of patents it was usual to\r\nrestrict the title to the recipient and his direct descendants (heirs\r\nmale of his body), in this instance, as shown by the wording of the\r\ndeed, the Sovereign deliberately intended to restore the Earldom to the\r\nheir male of Hugh, second Earl of Devon, which position was undoubtedly\r\noccupied by the claimant, William, Viscount Courtenay.\r\n\r\nCertain cases were cited in support of this contention, especially the\r\ncharter given by Richard II. creating William le Scrope Earl of\r\nWiltshire, and special reference was made to a patent of Charles I.\r\nappointing Lewis Boyle Baron of Bandon Bridge, which contained a\r\ndeclaration explaining the express intention of words absolutely similar\r\nto those used in the deed concerning the Earldom of Devon. The claim was\r\ntried before the Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords,\r\nconsisting of the Lord Chancellor (Lord Brougham) and Lord Wynford, who\r\nhimself, as Sir W. Draper-Best, had lately been raised to the peerage,\r\nfor the reason, as Greville, in his Memoirs, amusingly remarks, “that he\r\nis to assist the Chancellor in deciding Scotch causes of which he knows\r\nnothing whatever; as the Chancellor knows nothing either, the Scotch law\r\nis likely to be strangely administered.” The decision in this case which\r\nrelated to an English peerage, however, was eminently just, and the\r\nHouse resolved and adjudged: “That William, Viscount Courtenay, hath\r\nmade out his claim to the title, honour, and dignity of Earl of Devon.”\r\n\r\nBy this decision, William, Lord Courtenay, succeeded to one of the great\r\nhistorical titles of England, for the Earl of Devon is justly entitled\r\nto rank with his brothers of Shrewsbury, Derby, Huntingdon, and\r\nPembroke, who, occupying Earldoms created before 1600, have been\r\ndesignated Catskin Earls—a name concerning the derivation of which\r\nauthorities differ, some alleging that the ancient trimming of an Earl’s\r\ngown consisted of cat skin, in the place of ermine; while others are\r\ninclined to believe that in early times Peers of this rank were\r\npermitted to wear four (quatre) rows of fur on their coronation robes.\r\nIt is to be feared that now this question “des jupons” will never be\r\ndefinitely settled.\r\n\r\nOn the successful issue of his claim, William, ninth Earl of Devon, both\r\nat Powderham, in London, and in Paris, maintained a state which, however\r\nworthy of the vast domains appertaining to his great ancestors, yet cast\r\na heavy burden on the mere moderate appanage inherited by himself, with\r\nthe inevitable result that the estates were encumbered and the successor\r\nto the title seriously embarrassed. He died, a bachelor, in 1835, being\r\nsucceeded by his cousin, William, the representative of a younger branch\r\nof the family derived from Sir William Courtenay, third Baronet.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman, before his accession to the Peerage, sat in the House of\r\nCommons as Member for the City of Exeter, at one time also filling the\r\npost of Clerk to Parliament. After a long and valuable life, he died in\r\n1859, the succession devolving upon his son, William Reginald, eleventh\r\nEarl, whose name is still a household word in the land with which he and\r\nhis have so long been associated.\r\n\r\nMarrying Lady Elizabeth Fortescue, a member of a house also closely and\r\nhonourably connected with the best traditions of the county, Lord Devon,\r\nin all things which he undertook, exercised an influence indeed worthy\r\nof his illustrious lineage.\r\n\r\nGifted with a great kindliness of disposition—he was never known to lose\r\nhis temper or to utter a harsh opinion of others—and a high sense of the\r\nduties and responsibilities of his position, he spent his life in\r\nearnest endeavours, and whether as President of the Local Government\r\nBoard in Lord Derby’s Ministry, or as Chairman of the St. Thomas’ Union\r\nin the neighbourhood of his own beautiful home, his uniform punctuality\r\nand assiduity was only exceeded by his unfailing courtesy and\r\namiability.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of “Devon’s noblest son,” as he was popularly styled,\r\nwith equal truth and felicity, that from the date of his accession to\r\nthe title till the day of his death, he identified himself with every\r\ngood work, whether in the County of Devon or the City of Exeter; those\r\nwhich had as their aim the spread of religious teaching or the\r\nadvancement of the Church of England being specially near his heart. So\r\nactive was the part he played in all ecclesiastical matters, that on one\r\noccasion, so it is currently reported, Dr. Temple, afterwards Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, declared: “Why, Lord Devon is almost a lay Bishop.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, carried away, perhaps, by a desire to adequately perform\r\nthe obligations of his rank, Lord Devon’s expenditure largely exceeded\r\nthe income from his property. In the hopes that it would materially\r\nconduce to the welfare of that part of Ireland in which his estates were\r\nsituated, he laid down, mainly at his own cost, a line of railway, the\r\nheavy outlay on which and the paucity of returns added considerably to\r\nthe encumbrances which then burdened him. It should, however, be stated\r\nthat in the last few years this line, which cost its maker so dearly,\r\nhas been bought by an important Irish railway company for many thousands\r\nof pounds.\r\n\r\nThe embarrassments which these ventures charged upon the property were,\r\nmoreover, in no way lightened by the successor to the title, Edward\r\nBaldwin, twelfth Earl, whose expenditure as M.P. for East Devon and for\r\nthe City of Exeter, as well as his fondness for sport in many branches,\r\nadded costly burdens to an already overweighted exchequer.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, by a proneness to follow the dictates of a benevolent heart or\r\nthe desire to indulge in magnificence consonant with ancient tradition,\r\nwithout adequate consideration with regard to the means by which the\r\nimpulse was to be gratified, the glories of the Earldom of Devon have\r\nbeen shorn of their just splendour, and the holders of the dignity\r\ndeprived of the due means of maintaining their hereditary station.\r\n\r\nEdward Baldwin died in 1891, and was succeeded by his uncle, Henry Hugh,\r\nthirteenth Earl and Rector of Powderham, who married Lady Anna Maria\r\nLeslie, sister to the eleventh Earl of Rothes. By her, whose charity and\r\nsimple-minded goodness of heart made her universally beloved, he had two\r\nsons—Henry Reginald, Lord Courtenay, who married Lady Evelyn Pepys,\r\nyoungest daughter of the first Earl of Cottenham, predeceasing his\r\nfather in 1898; and Hugh Leslie, who is still living. Lord Devon died in\r\nFebruary, 1904, at the ripe age of 93, having survived his beloved wife\r\nby seven years.\r\n\r\n_Ubi lapsus, quid feci?_ Surely, if worldly prosperity could be earned\r\nby a blameless life and a just discharge of every duty, Henry Hugh,\r\nthirteenth Earl of Devon, Rector of Powderham, and Prebendary of Exeter,\r\nwould have enjoyed wealth beyond the desires of man; surely, if the\r\nhighest place and the greatest honours could be gained by courage and\r\ndevotion, they would have adorned his noble son, Henry Reginald, Lord\r\nCourtenay, who bore the suffering and faced the inevitable end of a\r\ndread disease with an heroic courage which more than equalled the deeds\r\nof his chivalrous ancestors.\r\n\r\nIt is to be deplored, in these days, when wealth has usurped to an undue\r\nextent that place which used formerly to be the privilege of high birth\r\nor great intellectual attainments, that the holders of an historic\r\ndignity are deprived, even for a time, of a revenue commensurate with\r\ntheir name and station; but as it was by the legal knowledge and\r\nforensic skill of Charles Pepys, Earl of Cottenham, the Courtenays\r\nregained their ancestral rank, so, perhaps, it is reserved for a noble\r\ndaughter of that same distinguished family, by her wise guidance, to\r\nassist in reviving the glories of a House which she has graced with her\r\nalliance and enriched with her many virtues.\r\n\r\nYet to those who saw the crowds, all sorts and conditions of men, which\r\nthronged the little churchyard at Powderham when the last four\r\nCourtenays were laid to rest, it was plainly evident that in their own\r\nfair county of Devon, the land of the green hill and the flowing river,\r\nthe love which is felt for all who bear the Courtenay name is not\r\nmeasured by the breadth of their acres or the length of their\r\npurse-strings, but in the heart of everyone who knows this ancient house\r\nand its kindly members, there exists a genuine and sincere wish that the\r\nRoyal Courtenays may ever flourish in all fulness of health, honour, and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n                                        H.

Mills, 1830._\r\n                 DOORWAY OF KING JOHN’S TAVERN, EXETER.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    OLD INNS AND TAVERNS OF EXETER.\r\n\r\n                   BY THE LATE ROBERT DYMOND, F.S.A.\r\n\r\n               Whoe’er has travelled life’s dull round,\r\n                 Where’er his stages may have been,\r\n               May sigh to think he still has found\r\n                 The greatest comfort in an inn.\r\n                                            —_Shenstone._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of his oracular and sententious utterances, Dr. Johnson declared\r\nthat “there is nothing that has yet been contrived by man by which so\r\nmuch happiness is produced, as by a good tavern or inn.” But, inasmuch\r\nas Boswell tells us that this opinion was pronounced just after the\r\ngreat doctor had “dined at an excellent inn,” we may fairly receive the\r\nsentiment as the pair received their meal—with a grain of salt. It would\r\nbe foreign to the purpose of this paper to enlarge upon the benefits or\r\nto denounce the evils connected with inns and taverns. It is enough to\r\nknow that they exercised on the domestic lives and habits of our\r\nforefathers an influence sufficiently potent to establish their claim to\r\nshare the attention of historical writers with churches, and\r\nmonasteries, and castles. The Royalist tendencies of the citizens were\r\nshown by the “King John Tavern,” in the Serge Market, at the head of\r\nSouth Street; the “Plume of Feathers,” at the bottom of North Street;\r\nthe “Unicorn,” in the Butcher Row; the “King’s Head,” formerly in\r\nSpiller’s Lane; and the “Crown and Sceptre,” in North Street.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of Exeter inns having anything like a connected history was\r\nknown for centuries by the inappropriate title of the “New Inn.” We may\r\nenter it now without any suspicion of its antiquity. Of the ladies of\r\nthe present day who are so familiar with the house, which bears over its\r\nalluring portal the name of “Green & Son,” probably not one in a hundred\r\nsuspects that her ancestors knew it equally well as the principal inn in\r\nExeter. The archives of the Corporation and of the Dean and Chapter, to\r\nwhom it jointly belonged, make frequent mention of the “New Inn,” the\r\nearliest being a lease in 1456, by which the Master and Brethren of the\r\nMagdalen Hospital granted to Roger Schordych and Joan, his wife, two\r\ntenements opposite “le Newe Inne,” in the parish of St. Stephen. It\r\nappears from Shillingford’s _Letters_ (p. 85), that the inn was then\r\n“newly built,” and one of the frequent squabbles between the Cathedral\r\nand the City authorities arose out of a “purpresture” or encroachment\r\nsaid to have been made there by the Chapter. A few years later, as we\r\nlearn from Mr. Cotton’s _Gleanings_ (p. 11), an entry was made in the\r\naccounts of the Receiver to the Chamber of 3_s._ 4_d._, disbursed for\r\n“four gallons of wine sent to Lord Stafford at the Newynne.” From this\r\ntime it often occurs on successive renewals of the lease. In John\r\nHoker’s _Extracts from the Act Books of the Chamber_, we find that on\r\nthe 16th February, 1554, during the mayoralty of John Midwinter, that\r\nbody resolved to establish at the “New Inn” the cloth mart previously\r\nkept at the “Eagle” from 1472—\"The newe Inne to be bought of Christian,\r\nthe wydowe of Thomas Petefyn, and the same to be converted into a\r\ncommodious hall for all manner of clothe, Lynnen or wollyn, and for all\r\nother m’chandises and w^{ch} shalbe called the m’chaunts hall.\" In\r\npursuance of this arrangement, Edward Clase and Elizabeth, his wife, who\r\nhad succeeded Thomas Peytevin, surrendered their lease to the Chamber in\r\n1555. The Act Book also shows that Thomas Johnson was deprived of the\r\ntenure of the “New Inn” on the 25th July, 1582, and was succeeded by\r\nValentine Tooker (or Tucker). This tenant had a misunderstanding with\r\nthe municipal authorities, in which he induced some of his mercantile\r\ncustomers to take up his cause; for amongst the municipal records is a\r\nletter addressed to the Chamber on the 20th of June, 1612, in which\r\nMatthew Springham, Walter Clarke, John Pettye, and eighteen other London\r\nmerchants, intercede for Tooker, who had received notice to quit his\r\n“nowe dwelling howse, the Newe Inn”; and they pray that in consideration\r\nof his years and services “some stipend may be given him.” Shortly after\r\nthis, Valentine Tooker died, and in 1617 his sons, Thomas and Samuel,\r\nstate, in a letter to Ignatius Jurdaine, the Mayor, that their father\r\nhad recovered £43 13_s._ 4_d._ from the Chamber by a Decree in Chancery\r\nfor being compelled to leave the New Inn, of which he had been tenant\r\nfor many years, and they desired that it might be paid without putting\r\nthem to the charge of taking out the Decree under the Great Seal. They\r\nthought it hard that their father should, without any just cause or\r\nindemnity, be thrust out of doors, “after keeping the New Inn for more\r\nthan thirty years, behaving himself honestly, and paying his rent duly,\r\nalbeit two or three several times raysed and enhanced therein on the\r\npromise afterwards to enjoy it for his life.” Notes are added in favour\r\nof the petitioners by the brothers Richard and Symon Baskerville.\r\n\r\nThis Simon Baskerville, a near relative of the Mayor, was a man of note\r\nand influence at this time. He was the son of Thomas Baskerville, an\r\nExeter apothecary, and was born in the city in 1573. He was successively\r\nappointed physician to James I. and Charles I., from the latter of whom\r\nhe received the honour of knighthood. A mural tablet in St. Paul’s,\r\nLondon, records that “Near this place lyeth the body of that worthy and\r\nlearned gentleman, Sir Simon Baskerville, Knight and Doctor in Physick,\r\nwho departed this life the fifth of July, 1641, aged 68 years.” The\r\ntransactions between the sons of Valentine Tooker and the Chamber appear\r\nto have closed on the 3rd of April, 1618, when they acknowledged the\r\nreceipt from that body of £6 16_s._, “in full satisfaction, recompence\r\nand payment, of and for the full and uttermoste value of all those\r\nselynges, stayned or paynted, clothes, shelfes, and all other goods,\r\nchattels,” etc., left by them in the “New Inn.”\r\n\r\nAfter the year 1612, we find many references to the “New Inne Halle” or\r\nMerchants’ Hall. This was let separately from the inn, and was used as\r\nan Exchange, where the cloth merchants congregated, and where the three\r\ngreat yearly cloth fairs drew together traffickers from all parts to\r\ncarry on the trade previously conducted at “le Egle,” opposite the\r\nGuildhall. These merchants rented stalls or shops, which were also\r\ndistinct from the inn, and in 1640 they petitioned the Chamber to\r\nprevent “foreigners,” by whom they meant non-residents, from buying and\r\nselling to one another in the city. They suggested that “the hygher\r\nroome of Sent Johns (Hospital) be ordenyd to be a store as a roome\r\nannyxt unto the New In halle, to reseve all wols browght unto thys\r\ncyttaye by foreners.” These restrictive and protectionist measures,\r\noperating with the introduction of steam power, finally caused the great\r\nwoollen manufacture of the West to depart into districts where trade was\r\nfreer and coal was cheaper.\r\n\r\nThe “New Inn” extended as far back as Catherine Street, including what\r\nwas till lately Mr. Seller’s coach factory. Perhaps the sole relic of\r\nthe original structure is the well in the cellar under this part of the\r\nold premises. When this well was opened, in May, 1872, its circular\r\nwrought courses of red sandstone plainly testified to its antiquity. The\r\nstabling was on the other side of Catherine Street, on a site still used\r\nfor that purpose, and belonging to the Duke of Bedford. A fire broke out\r\nin these stables in 1723, and their great extent is shown by the\r\nfollowing advertisement in Andrew Brice’s _Postmaster, or Loyal\r\nMercury_: “Whereas there has been a Report industriously spread abroad\r\nby certain malicious or designing persons, that all or most of the\r\nStables belonging to the New Inn, in the High Street, Exon, are burnt\r\ndown;—this is to certify that the said Report is vicious and false,\r\nthere being but one only Stable any way damaged by the said late Fire;\r\nand that there are remaining near Three times as much Stable room as\r\nbelongs to any other Inn House in that City, with handsome Accommodation\r\nfor Coaches, &c., and above an Hundred Horses.”\r\n\r\nThe structure already referred to was the first edition of the “New Inn”\r\non that site. About the time of the Restoration of Monarchy the house\r\nappears to have been re-built, and then was erected the great Apollo\r\nRoom, which still remains the chief ornament of the house. This splendid\r\napartment is 32½ feet long by 23½ feet wide, and before the floor was\r\nraised by Messrs. Green to increase the height of the shop below, it was\r\n17 feet high. The original contract for the construction of the rich and\r\nelaborate ceiling appears to have been made with the Chamber by Richard\r\nOver, who was to receive £50 “for his skill and labour in playstering\r\nthe fore chamber, or dining-room, in the New Inn, according to the form\r\nand mould which he hath propounded and laid down in a scheme or map.”\r\nBut the work appears to have been begun in 1689 by Thomas Lane, a\r\nplasterer, for five shillings a yard, and on the following 20th of March\r\nhe was paid by the Chamber £50 for this admirable work of art. It\r\ndisplays the royal arms, with those of the See of Exeter, and of the\r\ncounty families of Hillersdon, Calmady, Prestwood, Acland, and\r\nRadcliffe. The name of this fine room may possibly have been borrowed\r\nfrom the Apollo Club in London, near Temple Bar, a place of great resort\r\nin the reign of James I. Its principal room was called the Oracle of\r\nApollo, the bust of the god being set above the door of the room, whilst\r\nover the entrance to the house were some verses beginning:—\r\n\r\n                     Welcome all who lead or follow\r\n                     To the Oracle of Apollo.\r\n\r\nPerhaps our county magistrates sought his inspiration when they met at\r\nthe “New Inn” for public business. Amongst the many illustrious visitors\r\nwho have been lodged there, none ever excited more curiosity than that\r\ngreat potentate, Cosmo III., Grand Duke of Tuscany, who came with an\r\nimposing retinue, on his way to London, in the spring of 1669. The Mayor\r\nand Alderman waited on him in full state, and were received in a saloon\r\nabove stairs, perhaps the one that was afterwards converted into the\r\nApollo Room. His highness graciously desired the Mayor to be covered,\r\nlistened patiently to the inevitable speech or address, accepted the\r\ngift of money (£20), which it was then customary to present to great\r\npersonages, but politely declined his worship’s invitation to a banquet.\r\nThe Grand Duke afterwards received Sir John Rolle and his two sons, John\r\nand Denys, and on the next day returned the visit at their house in the\r\nClose, formerly the town mansion of the Abbot of Buckfast, and now\r\noccupied as a school by Mrs. Hellins. The fortunes of the “New Inn”\r\nbegan to decline when the Cloth Fair was removed to St. John’s Hospital\r\nin 1778, and its decay was probably hastened by the rivalry of the\r\n“London Inn,” now the “Bude Haven Hotel.” In his _Grand Gazetteer_,\r\npublished a little before this time, Andrew Brice describes the “New\r\nInn” as “not undeserving mention, not only as having most or all the\r\nProperties of an Inn super-excellent, but especially for one most\r\nmagnificent lofty and large room, called the Apollo; the Fellow of which\r\nscarce any Inn in the Kingdom can truly boast. It’s the property of the\r\nChamber. Herein is kept the present Cloth Hall, and at Whitsuntide fairs\r\nthe whole Court and nearly every Room are filled with Clothiers and\r\ntheir wares. It may casually be acceptable to some or other of the\r\nworthy Fraternity to note also that the said Apollo is the only\r\nconstituted Lodge of Exeter Freemasons.” When the testy but clever\r\nauthor of this description ended his long life in 1773, two hundred of\r\nhis brother Freemasons, members of several lodges, met in full costume\r\nat the Apollo Room, and joined the funeral procession to St.\r\nBartholomew’s Yard, singing as they went a solemn Masonic elegy composed\r\nfor the occasion. It was probably not long after this event that the\r\npremises ceased to be used as an inn; but the judges of assize continued\r\nto be lodged there until about the year 1836, when they removed to\r\nNorthernhay Place. In a large upper room, in the rear of the “New Inn”\r\npremises, the first popular Literary Society in Exeter held its meetings\r\nfrom the year 1830. It was founded five years earlier in some rooms in\r\nSouth Street, under the title of a Mechanics’ Institute. Soon after the\r\ntermination of its brief but useful existence, its place was supplied by\r\nthe still flourishing Exeter Literary Society.\r\n\r\nNext, if not equal, in importance to the “New Inn” was the “Mermaid,”\r\nwhose yard is now worthily occupied by two huge blocks of Industrial\r\nDwellings. There was a great oaken staircase, with carven handrail and\r\nample landings, leading to the assembly and other large rooms, for the\r\nquality folks, on the left of the entrance. Dr. Oliver, in a\r\ncontribution to a newspaper in 1833, mentions this assembly room as\r\nhaving been used for balls within the memory of old people then living.\r\nIt was 56 feet long and 17 wide. Its arched and moulded ceiling was\r\nenriched with gold and colour. On a carved stone in the centre of the\r\nmantelpiece (30 inches wide by 25 high), and dated 1632, were impaled\r\nthe arms of the old Devonshire families of Shapleigh and Slanning.\r\nTravellers and casual guests were lodged on the left side of the\r\nentrance; and besides the spacious yard there was a large garden with a\r\nsummer-house, commanding a prospect of fields and distant hills. Here\r\nthe city merchants could look down upon their ships in the haven below,\r\nas they smoked their pipes over cups of canary, and held converse\r\ntouching their foreign ventures. The “Mermaid” was a favourite sign with\r\nour forefathers, who had a liking for strange fishes, especially for\r\nthose connected with fable or mystery. An old book tells how, once upon\r\na time, a long consultation on the choice of a sign ended in the\r\nselection of the “Mermaid,” “because,” said the hostess, “she will sing\r\ncatches to the youths of the parish.” Not from the parish only, but from\r\nevery quarter of the county, did customers of high degree make their way\r\nto the “Mermaid” of Exeter. They sang catches, if she did not. \"What\r\nthings we have seen done at the ‘Mermaid!’\" wrote Beaumont to Ben\r\nJonson. Those dashing brethren, Sir Peter and Sir Gawen Carew, with a\r\ngallant company of knights and squires and justices of the quorum, rode\r\ninto its yard, in 1549, after conference with the misguided Catholic\r\ninsurgents at St. Mary’s Clyst, and there, after supper, words waxed\r\nhigh over the terms of dealing with the rebels.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the last century the “Mermaid” was a great\r\nrendezvous for carriers; and Edward Iliffe, to whom it belonged in 1764,\r\nwas a partner with Thomas Parker, of the “New Inn,” and two others, in\r\none of those long vehicles, then called “machines,” advertised to carry\r\npassengers from Exeter to London in two days. Iliffe had also “fly\r\nwaggons,” which performed the journey in four and a half days, setting\r\nout from the “Mermaid” every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. It may be\r\ndoubted whether this promised speed was maintained, for, in the course\r\nof some alterations of the covered entrance in 1825, discovery was made\r\nof a board announcing under the date 1780, that “Iliffe’s Flying Van\r\nleaves this yard every Monday morning for London, performing the journey\r\nin six days.” Edward Iliffe sold the “Mermaid,” about the year 1810, to\r\nThomas Bury, a wool-stapler, who erected for himself a substantial brick\r\ndwelling in the yard. Iliffe prospered in his business, and ended his\r\ndays at Exmouth, where he lived at Sacheverall Hall, with the title of\r\nEsquire, and a mural tablet to his memory may yet be seen in Littleham\r\nChurch. In later times the yard became the site of a brewery, carried on\r\nsuccessively by Mr. Joseph Brutton and the father of the late Mr. John\r\nClench. All traces of its former state are now obliterated, and the\r\n“Mermaid” no longer “sings catches to the youths of the parish.”\r\n\r\nBut although the “Mermaid” has completely vanished, its rival, the\r\n“Dolphin,” over the way, still retains the name, and little but the\r\nname, that was once so widely known. Francis Pengelly, an Exeter\r\napothecary, its owner at the beginning of the last century, gave it in\r\ncharity to trustees for certain benevolent purposes, which were not to\r\ntake effect until after the death of Joan, his wife. Once, in 1725, the\r\n“Dolphin” happened to remain unlet for a week, and was kept open by the\r\ntrustees. Their accounts show that during this short period there came\r\ncarriers from Moreton, Yeovil, Ashburton, Totnes, and Okehampton, with\r\nfifty-six pack-horses amongst them. The regular charge was sixpence per\r\nnight for each horse. A century before this, the “Dolphin,” like the\r\n“Mermaid,” was frequented by guests of a higher class. Amongst the\r\ndocuments preserved in the Record Room of Exeter Guildhall are some\r\nlengthy depositions of witnesses on a charge of murder, supposed to have\r\nbeen committed by some of these. From their testimony may be gleaned the\r\nfollowing condensed outline of the story. It appears that on a January\r\nnight, in the year 1611, there was staying at the “Dolphin” Sir Edward\r\nSeymour, of Berry Pomeroy, the first Devonshire member of the new order\r\nof baronets created by James I. as a means of raising money for his\r\nroyal needs without the aid of Parliament. Sir Edward was seated in an\r\nupper chamber, playing at cards with some friends, when the party was\r\njoined by Master William Petre, a member of a distinguished family no\r\nlonger connected with Devonshire, and by John and Edward Drewe, then of\r\nKillerton, but whose worthy descendants are now seated at the Grange in\r\nBroadhembury. One of the Drewes wore a white hat and cloak, the other\r\nwas clad in black. Edward carried a short sword, and John a rapier.\r\nThese three young gallants, already flushed with wine at the “Mermaid”\r\nand at the “Bear,” in South Street, drank “a pot or two of beer” and\r\nsome more wine with Sir Edward Seymour at the “Dolphin.” Perhaps they\r\nwere in too quarrelsome a mood to be very acceptable company, for after\r\ntarrying there an hour, and indulging in a rude practical joke on the\r\ntapster, they remounted their horses, dropped in at a few more taverns,\r\nand finally rode out of the city through the East Gate. Here Will Petre\r\nspurred on at a reckless pace up the broad highway of St. Sidwell, and\r\nwas soon lost in the darkness. The Drewes gave chase, but stopped at St.\r\nAnne’s Chapel, and shouted to their companion by name. Receiving no\r\nanswer, they groped their way to a house where a light was burning, but\r\nthe woman of the house had seen nothing of Will Petre. They rode on to\r\nhis home, at Whipton House, and there found his horse standing,\r\nriderless, at the gate, whereupon a servant of the house came forth and\r\nopened the gate. He (Edward Drewe) then willed him to take of his\r\nmaster’s horse, and then the servant demanded where his master was.\r\nDrewe, contenting himself with the answer that he thought he would come\r\nby-and-bye, rode on with his brother to their home at Killerton. The\r\ndawn of Sunday morning showed the dead body of Will Petre lying by the\r\ncauseway near St. Anne’s Chapel, with a ghastly wound on the head. The\r\nhue and cry was raised, and the two Drewes were taken as they lay in\r\ntheir beds, and brought before the city justices on the charge of\r\nmurdering their friend. Some of the witnesses testified to a quarrel\r\nbetween Edward Drewe and Will Petre; but, though the papers do not\r\ndisclose the issue of the trial, I think it must have ended in the\r\ndischarge of the accused.\r\n\r\nThe “Bear Inn,” where the three roysterers had called for a quart of\r\nwine, was in South Street, at the lower corner of Bear Lane. It probably\r\ntook its name from the Bere or Bear Gate, which was so styled in 1286,\r\nwhen the Cathedral Close was first surrounded by a wall. It was rebuilt\r\nin 1481, and was then the town mansion of the abbots of Tavistock, the\r\nwealthiest, if not the oldest, of the monastic houses of Devonshire. It\r\nis described as “le Bere Inne alias Bere” in the lease; by which John\r\nPeryn, the last abbot, in view of the pending dissolution of his house,\r\nleased it, in the year 1539, to Edward Brygeman and Jane, his wife, for\r\na term of sixty years. King Henry VIII., on the 30th January, 1546,\r\ngranted the freehold of the premises to William Abbot, Esq., by whom, on\r\nthe 15th February, 1548, they were sold to Griffin Amerideth and John\r\nFortescue, who, on the 28th October, 1549, renewed the lease granted by\r\nthe abbot to Edward Bridgman. Shortly afterwards the property was held\r\nin moieties, one of which belonged to William Buckenham, Mayor of Exeter\r\nin 1541, and was, in pursuance of his will, together with the other\r\nmoiety which he purchased of Edward Ameredith in 1565, conveyed by\r\nBuckenham’s executor, Philip Chichester, on the 6th of March, 1566, to\r\nthe mayor, bailiffs, and commonalty of the city of Exeter, for the\r\nbenefit of the poor persons lodged in the Twelve (Ten) Cells in Billiter\r\nLane, now called Preston Street. Prince, in his _Worthies of Devon_,\r\npublished in 1701, tells us that the arms of Tavistock Abbey and of\r\nOrdgar, its founder, were “to be seen in painted glass in the great\r\nwindow of the dining room,” with the figure of a man standing on a\r\nbridge. This was, no doubt, a rebus on the name of Bridgeman, the former\r\nowner. Even so late as the beginning of the present century, when\r\nJenkins wrote his _History of Exeter_, he could remember that a “great\r\npart of the old buildings, particularly the chapel, was standing a few\r\nyears since; they were built with freestone, of excellent Gothic\r\nworkmanship, decorated with fretwork panels. Mutilated inscriptions and\r\ndifferent sculptures were seen, and over the cornice, even with the\r\nbattlements, was a cabossed statue of a bear, holding a ragged staff\r\nbetween its paws.” Dr. Shapter is the fortunate possessor of some\r\nadmirable sketches of bits of the old building from the pencil of the\r\nlate John Gendall. These show the heavy stone arches of the basement,\r\nand a massive stone spiral staircase leading to the floor above,\r\nevidently portions of the structure rebuilt in 1481. When newspapers\r\nbegan to be published in Exeter, early in the last century, the “Bear”\r\nappeared now and then in their quaint advertisements, and, like the\r\n“Mermaid” and the “Dolphin,” it became a noted house for carriers. One\r\nof these advertisements announced, in July, 1722, that “Since the widow\r\nWibber has left The Bear, for the Better Accommodation of Merchants,\r\nTradesmen, &c., who frequent the Serge Market, at The Mitre, in the same\r\nStreet, is commodious Entertainment for Man and Horse by Henry\r\nDashwood.” Simon Phillip advertised that he had taken the “Bear” in\r\n1779, and when he died, in 1796, Mary, his widow, continued the\r\nbusiness. She kept it until it ceased to be an inn, and Robert Russell\r\nre-modelled it for his great waggon establishment. This gentleman,\r\nfamiliarly known as Robin Russell, offered to assist the Government with\r\nthree hundred draught horses at the time of the threatened French\r\ninvasion in 1798. He became wealthy, built himself a house, called\r\nRussell House, on the quay at Exmouth, and finally died there in 1822,\r\nat the age of 63.\r\n\r\nOur final notice must be given to the inn now known as the “Clarence.”\r\nIt was the first in Exeter, if not the first in England, to assume the\r\nFrench title of hotel, and in its early days was commonly referred to as\r\n“The Hotel in the Churchyard.” It was built about the year 1770 by\r\nWilliam Mackworth Praed, Esq., a partner in the adjacent Exeter Bank,\r\nthe oldest banking-house in the city. The first landlord of the hotel\r\nwas Peter Berlon, a clever Frenchman, who nevertheless failed in 1774,\r\nand was succeeded by one Connor, from the well-known “Saracen’s Head” in\r\nLondon. Connor remained less than two years, and the house, which was\r\nstill known as “Berlon’s Hotel,” was entered on by Richard Lloyd, who\r\nhad kept the old “Swan Inn” in High Street, where Queen Street now joins\r\nit. Lloyd succeeded no better than Berlon, and in October, 1778, he went\r\nto the “New Inn,” whilst his waiter, Thomas Thompson, took his place,\r\nand the house was thenceforward known as “Thompson’s Hotel.” This\r\nlandlord fared better than his predecessors, for his reign lasted more\r\nthan twenty years. In 1799, the hotel was kept by James Phillips, but in\r\nOctober, 1813, he was overtaken by the bad fortune of former landlords,\r\nand was succeeded by Samuel Foote, from Plymouth. Foote at once\r\nproceeded to carry out several improvements, including the restoration\r\nof the large assembly-room. For decorating this in the “Egyptian style,”\r\nhe engaged the services of an artist named De Maria, whose work on the\r\nceiling is described in a newspaper of the day as a masterpiece of\r\n“classic taste and elegance.” The new room was opened with a ball in the\r\nfollowing year, and in 1815 a meeting was held there to consider a plan\r\nfor lighting Exeter with gas—an invention which this city was the first\r\nplace in Devonshire to adopt. Samuel Foote was chiefly known to fame as\r\nthe parent of Maria Foote, the celebrated actress, whose brilliant\r\ncareer on the stage had just commenced at the time when her father\r\nentered on the hotel. She finally quitted the boards in 1831 to become\r\nthe wife of Charles, Earl of Harrington. The Countess survived until the\r\n27th of December, 1867. Her only son having died in his father’s\r\nlifetime, the Earldom passed to his uncle.\r\n\r\nSamuel Foote was succeeded by Mr. Congdon, who afterwards took the\r\nSubscription Rooms, while Mrs. Street became landlady of the hotel.\r\nUnder Foote and Congdon, the house was visited by many guests of high\r\ndistinction. In 1799, during Phillips’ time, a great crowd assembled in\r\nfront to welcome the arrival of Lord Duncan soon after his great victory\r\nat Camperdown, and his lordship was presented with the freedom of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Kent was there in 1802, and in 1806 Lord Cochrane, with his\r\nfriend, Col. Johnson, set out from thence in a coach drawn by six\r\nhorses, decorated with purple ribbons, to visit the electors of the\r\nimmaculate borough of Honiton. In 1817, Samuel Foote received no less a\r\nguest than the Grand Duke Nicholas, afterwards Emperor of Russia. But\r\nthe event which earned for the hotel its present name of the “Clarence”\r\noccurred on the 13th of July, 1827, whilst Mrs. Street was the landlady.\r\nThe Duchess of Clarence, afterwards Queen Adelaide, came to Exeter on\r\nher way to join the Duke, who had arrived at Plymouth by sea. Her\r\ncarriage was escorted into the city by a procession, and the streets\r\nthrough which she passed were gaily decorated. Lord Rolle and the\r\nRecorder received the Duchess at the hotel, and the Bishop and cathedral\r\ndons were introduced. On the next morning she went to the Bishop’s\r\nPalace and the Cathedral, and then pursued her journey to Plymouth, by\r\nway of Teignmouth and Torquay. In later years she visited the city as\r\nthe Dowager Queen Adelaide, and was again a guest at the “Clarence.”\r\n\r\nThis sketch of the old inns of Exeter, however imperfect, may at least\r\nsuffice to prove their importance in the trade of the city, and their\r\ninfluence in moulding the habits of the citizens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\n               _From a Photograph_]     [_by Frith & Co._\r\n                          HIGH STREET, EXETER.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE AFFAIR OF THE CREDITON\r\n                            BARNS—A.D. 1549.\r\n\r\n                  BY THE REV. CHANCELLOR EDMONDS, B.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few memorials of county history even in Devonshire at once as\r\nauthentic, as interesting and as important, as that of which the title\r\nof this chapter recalls a single incident. And not only is it authentic\r\nand interesting, but the story comes to us at first hand. It is written\r\nby one who was an eye-witness of most of the scenes which he describes,\r\nwho bore an honoured name, and held an honourable office in the City of\r\nExeter in the days of Henry VIII., Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth. He was\r\nuncle of a man yet more celebrated and gifted than himself—the famous\r\nRichard Hooker. His own name was John; his surname is sometimes written\r\nwith one “o,” sometimes with two, and sometimes it is written as if he\r\nhad another name altogether—Vowell. Uncle and nephew belonged, as Sir\r\nFitzJames Stephen says, to the party of progress in the greatest crisis\r\nwhich the world had seen for many centuries—a greater crisis, in some\r\nrespects, than any which has followed it.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he was brought into contact with two men who in importance are\r\npart of the history of their times—Dr. Moreman, the great Cornish\r\nschoolmaster, whose influence was immense amongst the West Country\r\nrebels who fought at Crediton; and Myles Coverdale, afterwards Bishop of\r\nExeter, who held a service of thanksgiving a little while afterwards\r\namong the bodies of the slain Cornishmen, “as, with stiffening limbs,\r\nthey lay with their faces to the stars.”\r\n\r\nIt is strange that the burning of the barns at Crediton should be a\r\ncatchword to recall the struggle that for the moment seemed to involve\r\nthe fate of Exeter and even the religion of England. But the barns at\r\nCrediton were like the barns of Hougoumont at the Battle of Waterloo.\r\nThe fight was critical, and it had decisive consequences.\r\n\r\nThe Diocese of Exeter appears to have shared in the indifference which\r\nthroughout the country marked public opinion in the matter of the Pope’s\r\nauthority. The words of the Act of Henry VIII., “in restraint of\r\nappeals” (to Rome), expresses the mind of most men at that time, “by\r\ndivers sundry old authentic histories and chronicles, it is manifestly\r\ndeclared and expressed that this realm of England is an Empire.” It is\r\ntolerably certain that if the changes brought about in England at the\r\nReformation had been restricted to the abolition of the authority of\r\nRome, there would have been no rising such as that which is here\r\ndescribed in opposition to it. But it was otherwise when the changes\r\nextended to the order and nature of the services by which the religious\r\nlife of the time was guided. Then the love which is felt for things\r\nfamiliar came into play. The old order changed, and yielded place to\r\nnew. But the break of the new day was not cloudless nor serene.\r\n\r\nIt is so natural to us to think of ourselves in England as a people of\r\none language, and that a very noble language, whatever the pure, not to\r\nsay pedantic, grammarian may say, that it is hard to think that in this\r\nWest Country the English tongue was not universal even as late as the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century. Devonshire and Cornwall, which\r\nfrom 1042 to 1877 formed a single diocese, were in some respects for\r\nmany centuries like countries foreign to each other. The Book of Common\r\nPrayer in the mother tongue of the English made no appeal, in the\r\nsixteenth century, to the hearts of the common people in Cornwall. This\r\nmost interesting matter does not appear to have attracted the notice\r\nwhich it deserves. If Cranmer and his colleagues could have made these\r\nadmirable offices speak to the ears of the Cornish, as they speak to the\r\nears of the English, Sampford Courtenay might have been left to fight\r\nits own battles, and the Crediton barns would have lacked at the\r\ncritical moment their most eager defenders.\r\n\r\nLong after 1549, in King James’ time, when the Great Bible, despised by\r\nthe Cornish, despised and rejected as an alien thing, had as a\r\ntranslation lost its hold upon the scholars of England, and its\r\nsuccessor in public esteem, the Geneva Bible, was in turn to yield place\r\nto what we now call the Authorised Version, the celebrated John Norden,\r\nwith Royal recommendations in his pocket, was making his journeys and\r\nconstructing his _Speculum_, his topographical description of this\r\nkingdom. He never completed it; indeed, it was not printed till long\r\nafter his time. But it is a vivid and for the most part trustworthy\r\nsurvey of the country generally, and the county of Cornwall is minutely\r\ndescribed. Nowhere can a better view be had of the condition of the\r\nWestern part of the Diocese in the distribution of language. Here are\r\nhis words; the spelling is Norden’s: “Of late the Cornishmen have muche\r\nconformed themselves to the use of the English tongue, and their English\r\nis equal to the beste, especially in the Eastern partes; even from Truro\r\neastwarde it is in menner wholy Englische. In the West parte of the\r\nCountrye, as in the hundreds of Penwith and Kirrier, the Cornish tongue\r\nis most in use amongste the inhabitantes, and yet (which is to be\r\nmarveyled) though the husband and wife, parentes and children, master\r\nand servauntes do mutually communicate in their native language, yet\r\nthere is none of them in manner but is able to convers with a straunger\r\nin the English tongue unless it be some obscure people that seldom\r\nconfer with the better sorte. But it seemeth that in a few yeares the\r\nCornish language will be by litle and litle abandoned.” That was how the\r\ncase stood in the beginning of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that two generations earlier the leaders of the Cornish\r\nrising demanded that they should be allowed to have the services of the\r\nChurch as they had been accustomed to have them, for that other new Book\r\nwas to them a foreign thing. “We will not receive,” they said, “the new\r\nservice, because it is but like a Christmas game.... And we, the\r\nCornish, whereof certain of us understand no English, utterly refuse the\r\nnew English.”\r\n\r\nWhitaker, himself a Cornish clergyman, though not a Cornishman, who\r\npublished his _History of the Cathedral of Cornwall_ in 1804, and\r\nrepresents the most intelligent criticism of his time, says, in his\r\nvigorous way, as if the old blood still ran in his veins: “The English\r\nwas not desired by the Cornish, but forced upon the Cornish by the\r\ntyranny of England, at a time when the English language was as yet\r\nunknown in Cornwall.” “This act of tyranny,” he continues, “was at once\r\ngross barbarity to the Cornish people, and a death blow to the Cornish\r\nlanguage.” “To use the universal tongue,” says Freeman, “whether\r\nunderstood or not, was no grievance; to have English forced on them\r\nwas.”\r\n\r\nTwo centuries before the Book of Common Prayer was issued, a Bishop of\r\nExeter, John de Grandisson, one of the most accomplished and travelled\r\nof the whole series of mediæval prelates, was describing the Cornish end\r\nof his Diocese to the Pope who had “provided” him to his Bishopric. He\r\nspeaks of it as if it were a foreign land “adjoining England only along\r\nits eastern boundary, being surrounded on every other side by the sea,\r\nwhich divides it from Wales and Ireland on the North. On the South, it\r\nlooks towards Gascony and Brittany; and the Cornish speak the language\r\nof those lands.” The barrier of language was breaking down fast in 1549,\r\nbut these illustrations will show how real a barrier it was.\r\n\r\nThe Act of Parliament which authorised the use of the Book of Common\r\nPrayer and, indeed, commanded it to be used, took effect on Whitsunday\r\nin 1549. A cold but competent critic, Mr. Goldwin Smith, has remarked of\r\nit that “Cranmer’s singular command of liturgical language enabled him\r\nto invest a new ritual at once with a dignity and beauty which gave it a\r\nstrong hold on the heart of the worshipper, and have made it a main stay\r\nof the Anglican Church.” He adds, however, that in the backward parts of\r\nthe country masses of people willing enough to part with papal supremacy\r\nand courts ecclesiastic “clung to the ancient faith and still more to\r\nthe ancient forms.” Various risings against the new order took place.\r\nTwo chief struggles stand out from the rest: one, in the East of\r\nEngland, with its centre around Norwich, the other, in the West of\r\nEngland, with its centre round Exeter. It is this last, of course, with\r\nwhich the present chapter is concerned, and in telling the story of this\r\nfragment of county history, as much use as possible will be made of\r\nHooker’s own language. It is a strange thing, however it may be\r\naccounted for, that this racy narrative lay for years in manuscript in\r\nthe archives of the City of Exeter, and was not printed till 1765. Even\r\nthen it was left to private enterprise, and was published by\r\nsubscription. The title runs: “The Antique Description and Account of\r\nthe City of Exeter, in three parts, All written purely By John Vowell,\r\nalias Hoker, Gent. Chamberlain, and Representative in Parliament of the\r\nSame. Exon, now first printed together by Andrew Brice, in North Gate\r\nStreet. M.DCC.LXV.” It is dedicated to the two representatives of the\r\nCity in Parliament at the time of its publication, and begs them\r\n“Candidly to pardon the Presumptions, and benignly accept this little\r\nOblation, of their most respectful and obsequious humble Servant, Andrew\r\nBrice.” In such a modest moment was this precious document given to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n“It is apparent and most certain that this rebellion first was raised at\r\na place in _Devon_ named Sampford Courtneie, which lieth Westwards from\r\nthe City about sixteen miles.” Then Hooker marks the day. It was Monday;\r\nit was in Whitsun-week; it fell that year on the tenth of June. It was\r\nindeed a memorable day. For, as already has been said, the Book of\r\nCommon Prayer was ordered to be used on Whitsunday, and was so used in\r\nExeter as elsewhere, and in Exeter “the day passed off quietly.” Hooker\r\nsays the statute was “with all obedience received in every place, and\r\nthe common people well enough contented therewith every where, saving in\r\nthis West Country, and especially at this said Sampford Courtneie.” “For\r\nupon the said Monday, the Priest being come to the Parish Church of\r\nSampford, and preparing himself to say the service as he had done the\r\nday before, ... they said he should not do so.... The Priest in the end,\r\nwhether it were with his will, or against his will, he relied (_sic_) to\r\ntheir minds, ... and forthwith ravisheth himself in his old Popish\r\nattire, and sayeth mass, and all such services as in Times past\r\naccustomed.”\r\n\r\nThen the movement took shape. Leaders were chosen, or chose themselves.\r\n“William Underhill or Taylor and one Segar, a labourer,” joined\r\nafterwards as “Captains” by Maunder, a shoemaker, and Aishcaredge, a\r\nfish-driver. “Like lips, like lettice,” says Hooker, “as is the cause so\r\nare the rulers.” These leaders were good enough for the Sampford\r\nCourtenay men, but it was otherwise when the prevailing discontent,\r\nslowly gathering strength at first, and directed as much against the\r\nLord Protector Somerset and “the gentlemen” who suddenly had become rich\r\nat the cost of the poor, as at the alteration in the services of the\r\nChurch, brought more powerful persons and larger bodies of men upon the\r\nscene. Then the dimensions of the rebellion revealed themselves.\r\nDevonshire sent knights like Sir Thomas Pomeroie; Cornwall sent squires\r\nlike Arundell and Winneslade, doomed to end their lives at Tyburn.\r\nArundell’s history is illuminative of the times in which he lived and of\r\nthe events in which he took part. Ten years before, at the dissolution\r\nof the monasteries, he had obtained the revenues of St. Michael’s Mount.\r\nIt was by his advice that the rebels laid siege to Exeter. If he had\r\nmarched on, his army would have gathered as it marched. The “ten\r\nthousand” who were at his heels at Exeter would have been fifty thousand\r\nbefore he reached London; but Exeter held out stubbornly, and Arundell\r\nit was, not Exeter, that surrendered. But this is anticipatory; and it\r\nis necessary to return to Sampford Courtenay on Whitsun Monday.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the disturbance at Sampford had spread through the\r\nneighbourhood, the local magistrates met together to endeavour to pacify\r\nthe people. They temporised and were timid; “they were afraid of their\r\nown shadows,” and “departed without having done anything at all.” So\r\nthings went on till the news reached the King and his Council, who\r\nalready had enough on their hands elsewhere. Sir Peter Carew and Sir\r\nGawen Carew, Devonshire men, were sent down with commissions to deal\r\nwith the rising as on consideration and conference with the magistrates\r\nmight seem best. Lord Russell was to follow. The two knights came with\r\nall haste to Exeter, and sent for the Sheriff, “Sir Peter Courtneie,”\r\nand the Justices of the Peace, “and understanding that a great Company\r\nof the Commons were assembled at Crediton, which is a town distant about\r\nseven miles from Exeter, ... it was concluded that the said Sir Peter\r\nand Sir Gawen, with others, should ride to Crediton, ... and to use all\r\nthe good ways and means they might to pacify and appease them.... But\r\nthe people being by some secret intelligence advertised of the coming of\r\nthe Gentlemen towards them, and they (being) fully resolved not to yield\r\none jot from their determinations, but to maintain their cause taken in\r\nhand, do arm and make themselves strong, with such armors and furnitures\r\nas they had, they intrench the highways and make a mighty Rampire at the\r\nTown’s End, and fortify the same, as also the Barns next adjoining to\r\nthe same Rampires with men and munitions, having pierced the walls of\r\nthe Barns with Loops and Holes for their Shot.”\r\n\r\nWhen “the Gentlemen” reached the “Rampire,” they were surprised to find\r\nall conference refused, and Hooker says: “The Sun being in Cancer and\r\nthe mid-summer moon at full, their minds were imbrued with such follies,\r\nand their heads carried with such Vanities, that ... they would hear no\r\nman speak but themselves, and thought nothing well said but what came\r\nout of their own mouths. The warlike knights, after conference,\r\nattempted the barrier, but a volley from the Barns repelled them with a\r\nloss of some, and the hurt of many.” But a servant of Sir Hugh Pollard,\r\nwhose name was Fox, set one of the barns on fire, and the defenders\r\nfled. When the magistrates entered the town, they found none in it but\r\nold women and children. And so it might seem that the incident was\r\nclosed, and the rebellion stamped out and quenched. It was not so. Here\r\nHooker’s account must be given without alteration or abridgment:—\r\n\r\n“The noise of this Fire and Burning was in Post-haste, and as it were in\r\na moment, carried and blazed abroad throughout the whole Country; and\r\nthe common people, upon false Reports, and of a Gnat making an Elephant,\r\nnoised and spread it abroad, that the Gentlemen were altogether bent to\r\nover-run, spoil and destroy them. And in their Rage, as it were a Swarm\r\nof Wasps, they cluster themselves in great Troops and Multitudes, some\r\nin one place and some in another, fortifying and entrenching themselves\r\nas though the Enemy were ready to invade and assail them.” Thus “the\r\nbarns of Crediton,” in themselves of small importance, became, as in our\r\ndays for a moment “Remember Mitchelstown” was, a war cry in a movement\r\nof high and lasting importance.\r\n\r\nWhile the country was in this excited state on the West side of Exeter,\r\nan incident of no great apparent importance stirred up a new outbreak on\r\nthe Eastern side. The father of Sir Walter Raleigh was riding through\r\nClyst St. Mary, when he overtook an old woman on her way to church,\r\ntelling her beads as she went. Quite needlessly, but also quite after\r\nthe fashion of the time, he entered into a polemical discussion, and so\r\nangered the old lady that she rushed into church, and shouted that she\r\nand her religion had been insulted, and that a “gentleman” had\r\nthreatened that if they did not give up their beads, their holy bread,\r\nand their holy water, he would burn them out of their homes. This was\r\nenough to set the heather on fire on the eastern side of Exeter.\r\n\r\nBy this time Exeter was the centre of a district in full revolt, and\r\namongst the country gentlemen and magistrates there was weakness and\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage that there arrived from Cornwall and North Devon\r\nthe promise of support from men of more mark than the leaders of the\r\nvillage revolutionists. The barns of Crediton had done their work; the\r\neyes of all men turned now to the walls of Exeter. The annals of Exeter\r\nare rich in records of worthy conduct. The proud motto, _Semper\r\nfidelis_, has been no inglorious boast. Amongst all her chronicles none\r\nis more to her credit than her behaviour throughout this siege. Around\r\nthe walls thousands of men were encamped, or came and went as\r\nopportunity offered or necessity compelled. The Cornishmen brought to\r\nthe siege men skilled in “underground” labour, and these dug beneath the\r\nwalls and prepared mines. Exeter had also at least one man of skill in\r\nlike arts. Setting pans of water over suspected places, he watched till\r\nthe vibrations of the water revealed the blows of the pick-axe below. It\r\nwas at once deliverance and merry relaxation of the strain upon the mind\r\nto divert all the slop and drainage of the city into the besiegers’\r\nmines. John Newcomb was this man’s name; and like the name of the man\r\nwho fired the barn at Crediton, it bears witness to the genuineness of\r\nthe narrative.\r\n\r\nMeantime, during this five weeks’ siege, strange things had happened.\r\nOne of the Carews had been to London to convince the Court of the\r\nreality of the peril, and with blunt directness had driven the\r\nconviction that the case was urgent, home to the minds of the Council.\r\nTroops were promised, Germans chiefly, and though their number was not\r\ngreat, they were used to discipline—war was their profession, not their\r\npastime—their arrival soon made a difference. The citizens were cheered\r\nand depressed alternately, as news reached them from the villages, that\r\nLord Russell and the Carews were coming. The darkest hour, it is said,\r\nis that before the daybreak. It was so in Exeter at the end of July and\r\nthe beginning of August. The siege had lasted five weeks, when news\r\nreached the city that the relieving troops had been defeated. Sunday,\r\nthe fourth of August, was the darkest day of the siege. While the\r\ncitizens were at Church, and, in obedience to the law, were using the\r\nnew order of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments, news\r\nhad reached the ill-affected in the city that the King’s troops had\r\nsuffered defeat. A violent mob paraded the streets, hungry and angry,\r\nshouting: “Come out, these heretics and twopenny bookmen! Where be they?\r\nBy God’s wounds and blood, we will not be pinned in to serve their\r\nturns. We will go out and have in our neighbours; they be honest, good,\r\nand godly men.” The Mayor drove them back to their dwellings, and then\r\nthe most faithful of the defenders entered into a covenant of fidelity\r\nto each other, no matter what might befall the city. Bedford House\r\nshould be their citadel, and if and when that ceased to be tenable, they\r\nwould go out by the postern gate into Southernhay, and cut their way\r\nthrough or die together. That very day the reported defeat was turned\r\ninto victory. The relieving army, after reverses all but fatal, finally\r\nwon the field. Monday inside the city was strangely quiet; before\r\nmidnight the invading Cornish, the besieging multitude, had melted away.\r\nWhen the morning of Tuesday broke, Exeter was free.\r\n\r\nSuch is the bare outline of the last siege but one of the many which\r\nExeter has sustained. “The barns of Crediton” raised the country side;\r\nthe bridge of Clyst St. Mary pacified it. Between the place where the\r\nfighting began and the place where it ended stood, and still stands, the\r\nancient city which so often in the past had been a place of defence to\r\nthe interests of the country, but never in all the long roll of her\r\nachievements had borne herself more bravely, more nobly, and more\r\nsuccessfully than when she disdained to surrender at the cry of hunger\r\nthe _rôle_ of law-abiding fidelity which was the crown and glory of her\r\nmayor and municipality in the July and August of 1549.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, but fitly, too, the struggle closed where it began.\r\nBack through Crediton, past the blackened barn, the Royal troops\r\nmarched. At Sampford Courtenay the shattered forces of the insurgents\r\nhad collected. Once more they fought, “and never gave over until that\r\nboth in the town and in the field, they were all or the most taken and\r\nslain. And so,” says Hooker, “of a traitorous beginning they made a\r\nshameful ending.”\r\n\r\nIt is a pathetic thing to read the Collect for Whitsunday, with its\r\nprayer for a right judgment in all things, and to think that the first\r\nresult of ordering it to be said in the mother tongue was the series of\r\nbattles, sieges, and executions which make up the terrible history that\r\nbegan to unroll its woes outside the Barns of Crediton.\r\n\r\n                                                      W.

WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat memories of the past crowd into the mind as we stand upon the\r\nfar-famed Plymouth Hoe, and gaze seaward towards the open Channel!\r\nLooking out over Plymouth Sound, crowded with shipping from all parts of\r\nthe world, one is apt to lose one’s twentieth-century identity, and to\r\nwander in thought over long-past and well-nigh forgotten days.\r\n\r\nFor, in truth, there is a glamour and a halo of romance about Plymouth\r\nHoe which can be found nowhere else; for there, beyond and around us,\r\nspread the blue waters ebbing and flowing as they have ebbed and flowed\r\nfor countless ages, and pregnant with mighty secrets and a wondrous\r\nretrospect.\r\n\r\nBeneath those waters lie buried many strange tragedies, and of the\r\nshores are told many wonderful legends; but there are many living\r\nstories connected with our national and naval history that are to be\r\nfound enshrined in our glorious annals. The Hoe, as regards its position\r\nand outlook, has changed but little since the days of Trojans,\r\nPhœnicians, Romans, Danes, Normans, Bretons, and Spaniards, all of whom\r\nin their turn have brought their ships within the bold headlands to east\r\nand west in quest of spoil or possessions.\r\n\r\nThe watchers on Plymouth Hoe may have witnessed many novel sights from\r\ntheir elevated standpoint, and may have joined in the welcome accorded\r\nto many distinguished visitors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\n _From a drawing by J. M. W. Turner._]     [_Engraved by W. J. Cooke._\r\n                             PLYMOUTH HOE.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom a very early period, Plymouth has occupied a prominent position in\r\nthe naval affairs of the kingdom, and on many occasions has been\r\nprivileged to supply men, ships, money, and other requisites for the\r\nfitting out of expeditions—some of a warlike character, against our\r\naggressive neighbours or foreign foes; others of a more peaceable\r\nintent, destined for the discovery of new countries and the exploration\r\nof unknown seas. From its position as one of the most westerly ports,\r\nand possessing, as it does, one of the finest harbours in the world,\r\nPlymouth has naturally been chosen as the starting-point of many of\r\nthose daring enterprises which have astonished the world; and doubtless\r\nthe Hoe has witnessed many interesting scenes, including the departure\r\nof these diversified expeditions and their triumphant homecoming. It\r\nwould seem to us but as a matter of course that our forefathers should\r\nhave betaken themselves to this famous place of outlook when anything\r\nunusual was going forward, even as we do at this time under similar\r\ncircumstances. But in olden time there were many reasons beside those of\r\nmere idle curiosity to prompt the inhabitants of Plymouth to assemble on\r\nthe Hoe. With what eager interest must they have repaired thither in\r\nthose early days, when the French, with fire and sword, descended upon\r\nit, and made havoc wherever they went! Small and insignificant as the\r\ntown then was, it appeared, nevertheless, to have possessed a peculiar\r\nattraction for our French neighbours, who, upon several occasions, paid\r\ntheir unwelcome visits. Thus, in 1339, we find it recorded that the\r\nFrench burnt the greater part of the town; again, in 1377, the same\r\ndepredations were committed; in 1399, the French attacked Plymouth, but\r\nwere defeated by the people of the town and neighbourhood, under Hugh\r\nCourtenay, Earl of Devon, the enemy losing five hundred men, and flying\r\nin disorder to their ships; in 1403 it was burnt by the French; and\r\nagain, in 1405, the Bretons invaded Plymouth, and burnt six hundred\r\nhouses. The name Breton or Briton Side, given to a street in the lower\r\npart of the town, and still in evidence, is traceable to a connection\r\nwith this event.\r\n\r\nBut the brave seamen of gallant little Plymouth were on other occasions\r\namply revenged for these outrages. Thus, in 1346, the battle of Cressy\r\nand siege of Calais are recorded, and it is a matter of historical fact\r\nthat the latter town was blockaded by twenty-six ships and over six\r\nhundred men mustered by the town of Plymouth, while Saltash, Millbrook,\r\nand other neighbouring places also sent their quota of help. Again, in\r\n1354, a fleet of three hundred ships sailed from hence, and within sight\r\nof the watchers on Plymouth Hoe, for the invasion of France, under the\r\ncommand of the King (Edward III.), the Black Prince, and other noted\r\nleaders. The watchers on Plymouth Hoe may have also taken part in the\r\nenthusiastic reception given by the people to the Black Prince, on the\r\noccasion of his landing here, after his memorable victory at Poictiers\r\nin 1356, bringing with him as hostages John, King of France, that\r\nmonarch’s youngest son, and some of his principal nobles.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to the age of Elizabeth that we must turn to find the\r\ngreatest interest centreing around Plymouth. In that reign, the town\r\nattained a degree of importance that it has never since lost; and, as a\r\nmatter of course, Plymouth Hoe was, as in still earlier times, from its\r\ncommanding position and extent, the rendezvous for the townsfolk, as\r\nwell as the muster-ground for troops. Many scenes of intense interest\r\nthat have been witnessed from this historic spot, rise to the mind’s\r\neye.\r\n\r\n“The brave sea-captains it (Plymouth) produced made a glorious history\r\nfor England in the reign of Elizabeth. Drake, first of England’s\r\nvikings, as a sailor, went out with his little fleet of schooners from\r\nthis port on the 15th of November, 1577, to plough with their small\r\nkeels a track through all the seas that surround the globe. The\r\nbirth-roll of Plymouth is rich and illustrious with names of seamen who\r\nwrote them on the far-off islands and rough capes of continents they\r\ndiscovered. Drake, Hawkins, Raleigh, Oxenham, and Cook sailed on their\r\nmemorable expeditions from this port.”[4]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Burritt’s _Walk from London to Land’s End_.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMany a time and oft did the people of Plymouth his away to the Hoe to\r\nbid Drake and his gallant company God-speed on their voyages of\r\ndiscovery and warfare. And it was no empty curiosity that led them to do\r\nthis, for Drake was their hero, beloved by everybody, and his ship’s\r\ncompany numbered many Plymouth men, the husbands, sons, and brothers of\r\nthose who looked wistfully and through blinding tears at the little\r\nvessels fast disappearing in the distance, out into the great unknown.\r\n\r\nAnd if they thus watched the outgoing, what about the home-coming? That\r\nwas an anxious time for the watchers on Plymouth Hoe, for no one knew\r\nuntil the ship actually arrived in port how many of their loved ones had\r\nsuccumbed to the rigours of the varying climate, disease, storm, and,\r\nworst of all, the dreaded Spaniards, with their horrible Inquisition. It\r\nis very evident that the townsfolk did take a very great interest in the\r\nevents and expeditions of this period, for one old chronicler informs us\r\nthat “Sir Francis (then Captain) Drake returning from one of his\r\nvoyages, and arriving at Plymouth on Sunday, August 9th, 1573, in sermon\r\ntime, and the news of his return being carried into the church, there\r\nremained few or no people with the preacher, all running to observe the\r\nblessing of God upon the dangerous adventures of the captain.”\r\n\r\nBut this home-coming of Drake’s, and the reception then given him, was\r\nas nothing compared to that accorded him when he returned from his\r\nvoyage of circumnavigation. As stated before, he left Plymouth on the\r\n15th of November, 1577, and returned on the 11th September, 1580. In\r\nthis voyage he had completely surrounded the globe—a feat which, it is\r\nalleged, no commander-in-chief had accomplished before. He had five\r\nvessels at starting, the aggregate tonnage of which did not reach three\r\nhundred tons, and a company of men, gentlemen, and sailors, all told,\r\namounting to one hundred and sixty-four. Before this voyage was half\r\ndone, Drake had parted company with several of his ships, and returned\r\nfrom that voyage with only one ship, _The Golden Hind_, otherwise known\r\nas _The Pelican_. But, alas! there came a time when the watchers on\r\nPlymouth Hoe looked in vain for their hero; for both he and his\r\ncompanion, Hawkins (of a noted Plymouth family), died at sea, and were\r\nburied in the ocean, within a few weeks of each other. It was said of\r\nDrake—\r\n\r\n     The waves became his winding-sheet, the waters were his tomb,\r\n     But for his fame the ocean-sea was not sufficient room.\r\n\r\nBut we have anticipated matters a little. It must not be forgotten that\r\nDrake and Hawkins, with many another Plymouth captain of renown, fought\r\nthe Armada of Philip the Second in 1588. All other events in the annals\r\nof Plymouth and Plymouth Hoe pale into insignificance beside that\r\nculminating event in the history of the time—that grandest of all\r\nEngland’s triumphs—described by Camden as “the only miraculous victory\r\nof that age.” For out there, well within sight of the watchers on\r\nPlymouth Hoe, was assembled the English fleet of a hundred and twenty\r\nsail, which was destined, by the Providence of God, to cause the\r\ndestruction of that magnificent armament, “whose descent upon our shores\r\nhad lighted up the beacon fires of British defiance from the Lizard to\r\nthe Hoe, and roused the spirit of our loyal tars to drive the proud\r\ninvaders from the seas.”\r\n\r\nLet us, for a moment, imagine ourselves thrown back to that eventful\r\nsummer’s evening in 1588, so graphically described by Macaulay, when—\r\n\r\n     There came a gallant merchant ship full sail to Plymouth bay,\r\n\r\nbringing the important and alarming news that the Spaniards were within\r\nsight of our shores. We take up our position on the Hoe, then, as now,\r\nthe favourite resort of the townsfolk, and find much to interest us.\r\nNear the Hoe is “The Pelican” Inn, with its terrace bowling green, and\r\nthere we find a noble company assembled. “Chatting in groups, or\r\nlounging over a low wall which commands a view of the shipping far\r\nbelow, are gathered almost every notable man of the Plymouth fleet—that\r\nfleet which will to-morrow begin the greatest sea fight the world has\r\never seen.”\r\n\r\nThere we see Lord Charles Howard of Effingham, Lord High Admiral of\r\nEngland, Sir John Hawkins, Admiral of the Port of Plymouth, Sir Francis\r\nDrake, Lord Sheffield, Sir Richard Grenville, the hero of the great\r\nfight with the Spaniards a few years later, Sir Robert Southwell, Martin\r\nFrobisher, John Davis, and possibly Sir Walter Raleigh.\r\n\r\nThese and many others were on the Hoe at Plymouth that summer’s evening\r\nthe day before the coming of the Armada. Some were enjoying a game of\r\nbowls, and tradition says that in the midst of the game intelligence was\r\nbrought that the Armada were in the offing. Howard called upon the\r\ncaptains to lay aside their toys, and prepare to shoot in another and\r\nmore serious game; but Drake, with that coolness which was one of his\r\nmost marked characteristics, respectfully answered his chief: “There is\r\ntime enough to finish our game, and to fight the Spaniards afterwards.”\r\nSo the game was fought to its finish, and then there was hurry and\r\nbustle on land and sea, men thronging to the shore to gain their ships,\r\nsails being spread, all sorts of commands being given, and then came a\r\nwaiting time, till the darkness of night fell, till—\r\n\r\n       The beacons blazed upon the roof of Edgcumbe’s lofty hall,\r\n\r\nand the warning radiance spread from hill-top to hill-top, from cape to\r\ncape, until in a few short hours the whole land was told that the\r\ndreaded and much-vaunted Armada was at last in the English Channel.\r\nThere is no need to follow the story further, as the scene is shifted\r\nfrom Plymouth Hoe, and the doings of Howard, Drake, Hawkins, and their\r\nbrave companions have passed beyond our ken.\r\n\r\nA few years later, in 1620, a little bark lay out there on the waters of\r\nthe Sound having on board her the seeds of a mighty empire; for in the\r\nlittle _Mayflower_ were the pilgrims who alienated themselves from home\r\nand friends for religion’s sake, and sought in a new clime a haven of\r\nrest and peace. They found it after many days and the endurance of much\r\nhardship. Elihu Burritt, an American writer, giving his reminiscences of\r\nPlymouth Hoe and the Pilgrim Fathers, says:—\r\n\r\n  As Noah took in with him all that was worth preserving of the old\r\n  world before the Flood, not only of animal, but of mental and moral,\r\n  life, so that little ruddered ark, with its sky-lights looking upward\r\n  to the face of God by night and day, and filled with the ascending\r\n  voice of prayer by those who trusted in His guidance, bore across the\r\n  wide world of waters the life-germs of all that was worth planting in\r\n  the New World, or that could grow in its soil.\r\n\r\nHow these seeds of Empire have borne fruit may be seen in the marvellous\r\ngrowth of the United States of America, which has now a population\r\nexceeding eighty millions.\r\n\r\nA few years later, viz., in 1625, all Plymouth flocked on to the Hoe,\r\nattracted thither by the presence of the King, Charles I., who there\r\nreviewed 10,000 troops from the counties of Devon and Cornwall. Twenty\r\nyears after, the Royalist forces were encamped on Staddon Heights over\r\nyonder, holding the rebel town under close siege, and the people who\r\nventured on Plymouth Hoe noted the white tents of the opposing forces\r\nwith a feeling somewhat akin to dismay, for they did not know what a day\r\nmight bring forth. But Plymouth remained staunch to the Parliamentary\r\ncause, and withstood Charles and his armies throughout the whole period\r\nduring which the Civil War lasted.\r\n\r\nThen, in 1652, a mournful procession landed under the Hoe with the body\r\nof Admiral Blake, who had succumbed to wounds received in a sharp fight\r\nwith the Dutch. His heart was buried in St. Andrew’s Church; his body\r\nreceived honourable interment in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe next memorable scene was the building of the Citadel—that huge\r\nfortification to the east of the Hoe proper—which served the double\r\npurpose of repelling invaders and of menacing the rebellious townsfolk,\r\nthe memory of whose disaffection still rankled in the minds of Charles\r\nII. and his advisers. This was in 1670.\r\n\r\nAnother notable scene was doubtless witnessed by the watchers on the Hoe\r\non the 14th of November, 1698, when Henry Winstanley completed and\r\nlighted the first lighthouse on the Eddystone reef. The story is well\r\ntold by Jean Ingelow in a graphic poem, for which we have only space for\r\na few lines:—\r\n\r\n           Till up the stair Winstanley went\r\n             To fire the wick afar,\r\n           And Plymouth in the silent night\r\n             Looked out and saw her star.\r\n\r\n           Winstanley set his foot ashore;\r\n             Said he, \"My work is done;\r\n           I hold it strong to last as long\r\n             As aught beneath the sun.\r\n\r\n           \"But if it fail, as fail it may,\r\n             Borne down with ruin and rout,\r\n           Another than I shall rear it high,\r\n             And brace the girders stout.\r\n\r\n           “A better than I shall rear it high,\r\n             For now the way is plain;\r\n           And though I were dead,” Winstanley said,\r\n             “The light would rise again.”\r\n                 .      .      .      .      .      .      .\r\n           With that Winstanley went his way,\r\n             And left the rock renowned,\r\n           And summer and winter his pilot star\r\n             Hung bright o’er Plymouth Sound.\r\n\r\nThe sequel to this episode is a sad one, for it is recorded that the\r\ntower was destroyed on the 26th of November, 1703, and its\r\npublic-spirited and confident designer perished with it.\r\n\r\n               And men looked south to the harbour mouth,\r\n               The lighthouse tower was down.\r\n\r\nOther scenes rise up before us as the centuries roll on. We see the good\r\ncitizens of Plymouth crowd on to the Hoe to witness the departure of\r\nCaptain Cook on his various voyages of exploration in the South Seas; we\r\nnote the pregnant comings and goings attending the great war with\r\nFrance, stately vessels sailing from the Sound in all their warlike\r\nglory, anon coming back crippled and wounded, with half their men killed\r\nor maimed. Then, later, we see the arch-cause of all this bloodshed—the\r\ngreat Napoleon—a prisoner on board the _Bellerophon_ in Plymouth Sound,\r\nwhile the waters below us teem with the boats and craft of all\r\ndescriptions of the curious sightseers.\r\n\r\nThe years slip by. This time we are at war with Russia, with France as\r\nour ally, and we stand on the Hoe to watch the stately troopships\r\nsailing off with the flower of our army to court death in the Black Sea\r\nor in the Baltic. History tells the tale.\r\n\r\nAt another time we watch the first shipload of emigrants bound for the\r\nAntipodes to plant New Englands in Australia, New Zealand, and\r\nelsewhere; and so it goes on through the centuries—the Plymouth Hoe\r\nbeautified by the hands of men, and surrounded by stately buildings, and\r\nwithin sound of a teeming population, but in its general character and\r\nappearance little changed since the days of which we have spoken; and\r\nPlymouth men of to-day congregate on the Hoe, and watch the huge liners\r\nand leviathan battleships coming and going, even as their far-away\r\nancestors noted the coming and going of Drake and his fighting ships\r\nthat bore over the blue waters of the Sound those pioneers of empire—the\r\nsea-dogs of Devon.\r\n\r\n                                                    W.

PREBENDARY GRANVILLE, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family of Grenville claimed descent from Rollo the Sea-King, and\r\nthey did not belie their fierce and adventurous ancestor. They were\r\nfighters to the core. Rightly they had for their bearing three\r\nhorseman’s rests, in which the lance or tilting spear was fixed. Some,\r\nof course, through the long centuries, were senators, magistrates,\r\necclesiastics; but as a rule they were men of the sword, serving their\r\ncountry by land and sea.\r\n\r\nThe first Sir Richard de Grenville, “near kinsman to the Conqueror,”\r\nsheathing his sword after the Conquest of South Wales, settled on the\r\nborders of Devon and Cornwall beside the Severn Sea. Concerning any\r\nfeats of arms achieved by his immediate descendants the chronicles are\r\nsilent. We have only their frequent summonses “to go with the King\r\nbeyond the seas for their honour and preservation and profit of the\r\nKingdom”; but another Sir Richard was Marshal of Calais under Henry\r\nVIII., and in the quaint language of Carew, “enterlaced his home\r\nmagistracy with martial employments abroad”; whilst his son, Sir Roger,\r\na sea captain, and the father of the future hero of the _Revenge_, after\r\nfighting the French off the Isle of Wight in 1545, went down in the\r\n_Mary Rose_ off Portsmouth, when that ill-fated vessel, like the _Royal\r\nGeorge_, two centuries later, capsized and sank with all on board.\r\n\r\nHis son, Richard, was then but two years old. The story of his boyhood\r\nhas yet to be discovered, but he first gave vent to his fierce fighting\r\nspirit when, a stripling of some eighteen summers, he took service under\r\nthe Emperor Maximilian against the Turks, obtaining therein the\r\ncommendation of foreign historians for his intrepidity and early\r\nknowledge of the art of war. Next we find him taking part in suppressing\r\nthe Irish rebellion, and though after this he settled for a while on his\r\nEnglish estates, his restless spirit and natural thirst for distinction\r\nled him to participate in the perils and glories of the brilliant\r\nengagement at Lepanto in 1572, when Don John of Austria, with the\r\ncombined squadrons of Christendom, defeated the Ottoman fleet. On his\r\nreturn to England he was knighted.\r\n\r\nOne of the features of the Elizabethan era was the zeal for colonization\r\nwhich pervaded the West of England. In common with Gilbert, Raleigh, and\r\nmany others, Grenville petitioned the Queen to allow an enterprise for\r\nthe discovery of “sundry ritche and unknowen landes.” Their request was\r\ngranted, and in 1584 two ships, provided by Raleigh and Grenville,\r\ndiscovered Virginia; and the following spring, Sir Richard took command\r\nof seven ships fitted with the first colonists of that country. On his\r\nreturn journey he sighted a Spanish vessel of 300 tons, and his ship,\r\nthe _Tiger_ (which was but 140 tons), out-sailing the rest of his little\r\nsquadron, had nearly overhauled the chase, when the wind suddenly\r\ndropped, and the little _Tiger_ and her big quarry lay becalmed. Sir\r\nRichard’s boats had all been carried away in a gale of wind, but,\r\ndetermined not to lose his prize, he “boarded her,” says Hakluyt, “with\r\na boat made with the boards of chests, which fell asunder and sank at\r\nthe ship’s side as soon as ever he and his men were out of it.” The\r\nSpaniard proved richly laden, and Grenville’s dare-devilry won him\r\n£50,000 in prize money.\r\n\r\nBut his δαιμονίη ἀρετὴ (as Froude calls it) was soon to be exemplified\r\nin a still more striking manner in that last great service for his Queen\r\nand country, in which he so nobly sacrificed his life, and which has\r\nbeen told by Raleigh and Tennyson in “Letters of Gold.” To his great\r\nmortification, he had been prevented from sharing in the glories of the\r\ndefeat of the Armada, having received the Queen’s special commands not\r\nto quit Cornwall during the peril; but in the summer of 1591 he was\r\nappointed Vice-Admiral, under Lord Thomas Howard, and despatched to the\r\nAzores to intercept an unusually rich treasure fleet, which was lying at\r\nHavannah ready for the homeward voyage. Grenville’s ship was the\r\n_Revenge_, a second-class galleon, carrying twenty-two heavy guns,\r\ntwelve light ones, and twelve small pieces used for repelling boarders.\r\nShe had carried Drake’s flag against the Armada three years before, and\r\nwas considered one of the best types of a fighting ship.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of August, Lord Thomas Howard’s squadron, consisting of six\r\nmen of war and nine or ten victuallers and pinnaces, was riding at\r\nanchor in the bay of Flores; many of the crews were ashore digging for\r\nballast, filling water casks, and obtaining fresh provisions and fruit\r\nfor the sick, who numbered nearly half the strength of the fleet, for\r\nfever and scurvy had made havoc among the ships’ companies. Suddenly an\r\nEnglish pinnace, the _Moonshine_, swept round a headland into the bay\r\nwith the alarming intelligence that an armada of twenty Spanish\r\nmen-of-war and over thirty transports and smaller craft were close at\r\nhand, despatched by Philip II. to protect his treasure ships.\r\n\r\nHoward at once determined that he was in no condition to fight a force\r\nso superior, and accordingly made signal to weigh anchor instantly. All\r\nobeyed but the _Revenge_, Grenville being delayed, according to Raleigh,\r\nin getting his sick men brought on board from the shore; and when at\r\nlast she got under way, she had lost the wind, and was unable to follow\r\nthe other vessels as they ran past the Spanish fleet to windward. A\r\nsecond line of retreat was still open to him: by cutting his mainsail,\r\nhe could run before the wind, pass the Spaniards to leeward, and rejoin\r\nthe flag in the open sea. But to pass an enemy to leeward was a\r\nconfession of inferiority to which Grenville would not stoop, and,\r\nthough urged to this course by his officers and crew, he scornfully and\r\npassionately refused, and, sword in hand, drove his men to their posts,\r\nswearing that he would hew his way single-handed through the whole\r\nSpanish fleet, or perish in the attempt.\r\n\r\nFor a while he prevailed, compelling several of the foremost to give\r\nway, who sprang their luff and fell under the lee of the _Revenge_. But\r\nhis success was short-lived; the _Revenge_, coming under the lee of the\r\ngreat _San Philip_, of 1,500 tons, was becalmed. This was about three\r\no’clock in the afternoon; and while the _Revenge_ was hotly engaged with\r\nthis gigantic adversary, four more Spanish ships-of-war ranged\r\nalongside, and, after a furious cannonade, attempted to board her, but\r\nin vain; and the _San Philip_, after receiving from the lower tier of\r\nguns of the _Revenge_ an especially deadly salvo, “discharged with\r\ncross-bar shot, shifted herself with all diligence from her sides,\r\nutterly misliking her first entertainment.” But her place was at once\r\ntaken by another Spaniard, and, indeed, through the twelve or fifteen\r\nhours during which the battle lasted, Grenville’s ship was constantly\r\nfighting against overwhelming odds. All through the August night the\r\nfight continued under the quiet stars, ship after ship washing up on the\r\n_Revenge_ like clamouring waves upon a rock, only to fall back foiled\r\nand shattered amidst the roar of artillery:—\r\n\r\n Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,\r\n Ship after ship, the whole night long, with their battle-thunder and\r\n    flame,\r\n Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her\r\n    shame,\r\n For some were sunk, and some were shattered, and some would fight no\r\n    more;\r\n God of battles! was ever a battle like this in the world before?\r\n\r\nThough wounded early in the day, Grenville was able to fight his ship\r\nfrom the upper deck till an hour before midnight, when he was again\r\nwounded, this time in the body, with a musket ball. The sailors carried\r\nhim below, and as his wounds were being dressed, a shot crashed through\r\nthe _Revenge_, stretched the doctor lifeless, and inflicted an injury to\r\nSir Richard’s head from which, in two or three days, he died.\r\n\r\nAnd still the battle raged; and still ship after ship drew out of\r\naction, utterly defeated by the splendid gunnery and desperate courage\r\nof Grenville’s men. Gradually the fire slackened; before daylight it\r\nceased altogether, for the Spaniards abandoned their attempts to sink\r\nthe _Revenge_ or carry her by board. Yet fifteen out of their twenty\r\nmen-of-war had been hotly engaged with her: two of them she had sunk\r\noutright; a third was so damaged that her crew ran her on shore to save\r\ntheir lives; a fourth was in a sinking condition. Dawn found the enemy’s\r\nimmense fleet encircling the one English ship like wolves round a dying\r\nlion, and wary of approaching him in his last agony. When the sun rose,\r\nthe survivors of the crew began to realise their desperate plight. Sir\r\nRichard commanded the master-gunner to split and sink the ship, that\r\nthereby nothing might remain of glory or victory to the Spaniards, and\r\nendeavoured to persuade the crew “to yield themselves to God and to the\r\nmercy of none else, but as they had, like valiant resolute men, repulsed\r\nso many enemies, they should not now shorten the honour of their nation\r\nby prolonging their own lives by a few hours or a few days.”\r\n\r\nThe chief gunner and a few others consented; but the rest having dared\r\nquite enough for mortal men, refused to blow up the ship, and\r\nsurrendered to the enemy. Grenville was carried in a dying condition to\r\nthe ship of the Spanish Admiral, and as he lay upon his couch on the\r\ndeck, the captains of the fleet crowded round to see the expiring hero,\r\nwho, feeling his end approaching, showed not any sign of faintness, but\r\nspake these words in Spanish, and said: “Here die I, Richard Grenville,\r\nwith a joyful and quiet mind, for that I have ended my life as a true\r\nsoldier ought to do, that hath fought for his country, Queen, religion\r\nand honour. Wherefore my soul most joyfully departeth out of this body,\r\nand shall always leave behind it an everlasting fame of a valiant and\r\ntrue soldier that hath done his duty as he was bound to do.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the fight at Flores in that August of 1591—“a fight memorable\r\neven beyond credit and to the height of some heroic fable.” It has been\r\ncalled “England’s naval Thermopylæ.” It was from the first as hopeless a\r\nbattle as that of the Spartans under the brave Leonidas, and its moral\r\neffects at the time were hardly less than that of Thermopylæ. Froude\r\ntells us it struck a deeper terror, though it was but the action of a\r\nsingle ship, into the hearts of the Spanish people—it dealt a more\r\ndeadly blow upon their fame and moral strength than even the destruction\r\nof the Armada itself, and in the direct results which arose from it it\r\nwas scarcely less disastrous to them. Men may blame Sir Richard\r\nGrenville for his obstinacy, and what they deem his false notion of\r\nhonour in scorning to turn his back upon the foe when the odds were so\r\noverwhelmingly against him, but at least it must be conceded that his\r\ncourage and that of his crew have immortalised his name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SIR BEVILL GRENVILLE.\r\n  (_From an Oil Painting._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nPassing over Sir Richard’s son, John, who followed Drake and was drowned\r\nin the ocean, “which became his bedde of honour,” and also another son,\r\nSir Bernard, we come to the latter’s famous son, Sir Bevill—a man no\r\nwhit inferior in loyalty and courage to his illustrious grandsire, and\r\nwhom men called the English Bayard. When Charles I., in 1639, raised an\r\narmy against the Scots, Bevill Grenville joined the Royal Standard at\r\nthe head of a troop of horse at York. “I cannot contain myself within my\r\ndoors,” he wrote, “when the King of England’s standard waves in the\r\nfield upon so just an occasion, the cause being such as must make all\r\nthose that die in it little inferior to martyrs. And for my own part, I\r\ndesire to acquire an honest name or an honourable grave. I never loved\r\nmy life or ease so much as to shun such an occasion, which if I should,\r\nI were unworthy of the profession I have held, or to succeed those\r\nancestors of mine who have so many of them in several ages sacrificed\r\ntheir lives for their country.”\r\n\r\nHistory shows this to have been a bloodless campaign, but the above\r\nextract proves Grenville’s hereditary spirit, and the King, in token of\r\nhis approval, knighted him at Berwick-on-Tweed before the army broke up;\r\nand when, three years later, the storm at last burst over England, which\r\nhad been so long threatening, Charles I. had no more loyal supporter\r\nthan Sir Bevill Grenville. Clarendon says he was “the most generally\r\nloved man in Cornwall.” He was the soul of the Royalist cause there, and\r\nhis influence was so great that he readily raised a body of volunteers\r\nfifteen hundred strong. At Bradock Down, near Liskeard, where the first\r\nimportant encounter with the Parliamentarian troops took place, Sir\r\nBevill led the van. Describing the fight to his wife, he writes: “After\r\nsolemn prayers at the head of every division, I led my part away, who\r\nfollowed me with so great a courage, both down the one hill and up the\r\nother, that it struck a terror into them,” with the result that twelve\r\nhundred prisoners were captured, and all the guns. The next engagement\r\ntook place at Stratton (distant only a few miles from Grenville’s own\r\nhome in the adjoining parish of Kilkampton) on May 16th, 1643, where he\r\nwas again conspicuous for his personal courage. The Earl of Stamford,\r\nwho commanded the Parliamentarian troops, which numbered close on 6,000,\r\nall perfectly equipped and victualled, had encamped in a very strong\r\nposition on the top of a hill, now called Stamford Hill, near the\r\nvillage of Stratton. It is an isolated grassy hill on a ridge which runs\r\nnearly due north and south. The sides on the east and south are the\r\nsteepest, whilst the western slope has an ancient earthwork near the\r\nsummit, which Stamford had defended with guns that ought to have\r\nrendered it impregnable. The Royalist troops, less than half their\r\nnumber, short of ammunition, and so destitute of provisions that the\r\nbest officers had but a biscuit a day, lay at Launceston. They\r\nnevertheless marched the twenty miles to Stratton “with a resolution to\r\nfight with the enemy upon every disadvantage of place or number.” In the\r\nevening they halted, footsore and hungry, a mile from the base of the\r\nhigh hill on which the Parliamentarian troops lay in overwhelming\r\nstrength, and determined to attack them at daybreak. Weary as they were,\r\nthe men stood to their arms all night, for the enemy were too near to\r\nmake rest possible, and with the first light, Sir Bevill, to whom every\r\ninch of the ground was, of course, perfectly familiar, and to whom,\r\nconsequently, was committed the ordering of the fight, divided the\r\ntroops into four storming parties. The little army was too small to\r\nmerit, when divided into such parts, any other designation. In the\r\nmorning the fight commenced, and continued till the afternoon was well\r\nadvanced, but no impression could be made by the gallant Cornishmen, who\r\nwere repulsed again and again. At last powder began to fail, and it\r\nbecame a question between retreat, which implied certain disaster, or\r\nvictory. A final and heroic effort was made; muskets were laid aside,\r\nand, trusting to pike and sword alone, the lithe Cornishmen pressed\r\nonwards and upwards. Grenville led the party on the western slope, and\r\nSir John Berkeley that on the northern, while Hopton and the other\r\ncommanders scaled the south and east sides. Their silent march seems to\r\nhave struck their opponents with a sense of power, and the defence grew\r\nfeebler. Grenville first reached the crest, and seized the entrenchment,\r\nand captured the thirteen brass field-pieces and one mortar by which it\r\nwas defended; and when Berkeley prevailed on the north side, the\r\nParliamentarian horse fled from the hill headlong down the steep\r\ndescent, and made off. This had its moral effect on the defenders of the\r\nother two sides of the camp, and their resistance perceptibly slackened.\r\nSoon the other two storming parties, who had had the steepest climb,\r\npressed upward, and the enemy, despite the efforts of their officers to\r\nrally them, made off to the adjoining heights. The victorious commanders\r\nembraced one another on the hard-won hilltop, thanking God for a success\r\nfor which at one time they had hardly ventured to hope. It was no time\r\nto prolong their rejoicings, as the enemy, demoralised though they were,\r\nappear to have rallied somewhat, and to have shown a disposition to\r\nrenew the combat; but Grenville quickly turned their own captured cannon\r\non them, and a few rounds sufficed to dislodge them. Panic ensued, and a\r\ngeneral stampede, in which arms and accoutrements were flung aside,\r\nconcluded the fight of Stratton. By this decisive victory, not only was\r\nCornwall cleared of the enemy and secured for the King, but the whole of\r\nDevon, excepting a few of the principal towns, fell into the hands of\r\nthe Royalists. The King was not unmindful of the gallant Sir Bevill’s\r\nshare in the fight, but wrote him a gracious letter promising further\r\nproofs of his bounty and favour.\r\n\r\nThe following June, the Cornish army joined that under Prince Maurice\r\nand the Marquis of Hertford at Chard, and soon Taunton, Bridgwater,\r\nGlastonbury, and Dunster Castle were taken. They then proceeded to\r\nattack Sir William Waller, who had occupied an extremely strong position\r\non the lofty ridge of Lansdown, near Bath. There he had raised a\r\nbreastwork behind which his guns were posted, and he had so distributed\r\nhis foot and horse as to defend all points of access. Realising the\r\ntremendous strength of his position, the Royalists wisely resolved not\r\nto break themselves upon it, and were actually turning to resume their\r\nmarch when the whole body of Waller’s horse came thundering down the\r\nhill upon their rear and flank, striking them with a crash they could\r\nnot withstand, and throwing them into disorder from which they could not\r\nrecover, till Slanning came up with a party of three hundred Cornish\r\nmusketeers, and with his aid the enemy were beaten off and chased back\r\nto the hill again. Hopton now assumed the offensive. The blood of the\r\nwhole army was beating hotly. It is said that the Cornishmen, under Sir\r\nBevill, coveted Waller’s cannon, and begged at least to be allowed “to\r\nfetch off those cannon.” Leave was given, and up the steep height the\r\nCornishmen went with a rush: the horse on the right, the musketeers on\r\nthe left, and Sir Bevill himself leading the pikes in the centre. In\r\nthis order the Cornish moved forward, much as they had moved at\r\nStratton, slowly and doggedly. In the face of the enemy’s cannon and\r\nsmall shot from their breastworks, they at length gained the brow of the\r\nhill, having sustained two full charges from Waller’s horse, but in the\r\nthird charge Sir Bevill’s horse had given way; the cohesion of the pikes\r\nwas broken, and instantly the enemy was in among them, hewing them down;\r\nthe officers were falling fast, and Sir Bevill himself, sorely wounded\r\nand fighting valiantly, was struck out of his saddle by a pole-axe, of\r\nwhich hurt he died very shortly. Young John Grenville, a lad of sixteen,\r\nsprang, it is said, into his father’s saddle, and led the charge, and\r\nthe Cornishmen followed with their swords drawn and with tears in their\r\neyes, swearing they would kill a rebel for every hair of Sir Bevill’s\r\nbeard; and at last the whole Royalist force surged over Waller’s\r\nbreastworks, and the victory was theirs.\r\n\r\nNever was a man more universally or deservedly beloved than Sir Bevill,\r\nand it is said that his untimely death was as bitterly lamented by the\r\nParliamentarian troops as it was by his own followers.\r\n\r\nOf a very different character and temperament was his brother, another\r\nSir Richard Grenville, of whose life as a soldier only the very briefest\r\nsketch can be given. He seems to have had little in common with the long\r\nline of his illustrious predecessors, except their just pride of\r\nancestry and their appetite for fighting; for he was undoubtedly a brave\r\nsoldier of no little experience and skill. He entered the army at an\r\nearly age, and left England when he was eighteen, and saw much service\r\nin France, Holland, Germany, and the Netherlands. Next he took part in\r\nthe disastrous expeditions to Cadiz and the Island of Rhe, in both of\r\nwhich he was accompanied by his young cousin, George Monk, who always\r\nregarded him as his father-in-arms. Like Sir Bevill, he accompanied\r\nCharles I. to Scotland, having also raised a troop of horse; and in 1641\r\nhe took a prominent part in suppressing the rebellion in Ireland, when\r\nin fire and blood the wretched Irish were made to do penance for their\r\noutburst of savagery, to which they had been goaded by Strafford’s\r\nimperious rule. Having been recalled to England in 1643 for\r\ninsubordination to the Marquis of Ormond, Sir Richard pretended to adopt\r\nthe Parliamentarian cause, and was made a Major-General of Horse; but\r\nhaving learnt all the secrets of their campaign, he treacherously\r\nmarched his soldiers to Oxford, and joined the King. For such abominable\r\ntreachery he was rightly denounced, and no epithets were too choice to\r\napply to him. He was, moreover, excepted from all pardon, both as to\r\nlife and estate. Shortly afterwards he was placed by Prince Rupert in\r\ncommand of the troops that were besieging Plymouth, and it was mainly by\r\nhis successful tactics that Lord Essex was utterly defeated in Cornwall\r\nin 1644, when the King commanded the Cavaliers in person.\r\n\r\nAfter this he was appointed “The King’s General in the West,” a title of\r\nwhich he was justly proud, and which was eventually carved on his\r\ntombstone at Ghent. Considering himself thus constituted\r\nCommander-in-Chief, he afterwards refused, when called upon to do so by\r\nthe Prince’s Council, to act in any subordinate position; and hence\r\narose those unhappy dissensions and jealousies which finally wrecked the\r\nroyal cause in the West. Grenville was placed under arrest, and\r\ncashiered from his command without any court-martial. In spite of his\r\noverbearing manners and tyrannical conduct, of which frequent complaints\r\nhad been made, public opinion was strongly in his favour and clamoured\r\nfor his release, whilst the soldiers refused to be commanded by Hopton\r\nor anyone else, and both officers and men, to the number of four\r\nthousand, petitioned the Prince in his favour. Sir Richard’s\r\nimprisonment and the dissensions that arose in consequence undoubtedly\r\ngave the finishing stroke to the war in the West; the service everywhere\r\nlanguished; the soldiers gradually deserted, and Lord Hopton was\r\ncompelled, after some faint resistance, to disband, and accept of such\r\nconditions as the enemy would give. Sir Richard, it must be confessed,\r\nrepresented the worst type of Cavalier. He was frequently actuated by\r\nthe dictates of a violent and revengeful disposition, and was intriguing\r\nand unscrupulous. He died abroad in exile in 1659.\r\n\r\nThe heroism of young John Grenville, Sir Bevill’s son, in taking command\r\nof his father’s regiment at Lansdown when the latter fell mortally\r\nwounded, met its recognition a month later at Bristol, when he was\r\nknighted. After this he served under his uncle, Sir Richard, at the\r\nsiege of Plymouth and in Cornwall, and apparently accompanied Charles I.\r\nin his march from the West after the defeat of Lord Essex; for the next\r\ntime we hear of him is at the second battle of Newbury (27th October,\r\n1644), where he narrowly escaped his father’s fate. Being in the\r\nthickest of the fight, and having received several other wounds, he was\r\nat last felled to the ground with a very dangerous one in the head from\r\na halberd, which rendered him unconscious, and he was left for dead, nor\r\nwas he discovered until a body of the King’s horse, charging the enemy\r\nafresh and beating them off the ground, found him covered with blood and\r\ndust, but still living. He was carried to where the King and Prince of\r\nWales were, who sent him to Donnington Castle hard by, to be treated for\r\nhis wounds; but no sooner were the armies drawn off from the field of\r\nbattle than the castle itself was besieged by the enemy, and their\r\nbullets constantly whistled through the room where the young sufferer\r\nlay, during the twelve days which elapsed before the defenders were\r\nrelieved by the King at the third battle of Newbury. On his recovery\r\nfrom his wounds, Sir John Grenville was promoted to the rank of a\r\nBrigadier of Foot, and the following year was appointed a Gentleman of\r\nthe Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales, who had formed a strong\r\nattachment for him, which proved lifelong. He remained with the Prince\r\naccordingly during the rest of the war, and accompanied him in his\r\nflight to the Isles of Scilly, and afterwards to Jersey.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year 1648 the Scilly Islands revolted from the\r\nParliament, and became the last rallying point of the Royalists under\r\nGrenville, who was appointed Governor to hold them for the King; but he\r\nhad scarcely been there three weeks when tidings reached him of the\r\nKing’s execution. With passionate indignation, he at once proclaimed\r\nCharles II. King, and could find no words hard enough for Cromwell and\r\nthe Regicides. He fortified the islands, already strong from their\r\nnatural position and existing earthworks; and in this he was ably\r\nassisted by his brother, Bernard, then barely eighteen, who had run away\r\nfrom his tutor, and lay concealed at Menabilly, near Fowey, whence he\r\nmanaged to carry considerable reinforcements for the defence of the\r\nislands. For two years Sir John carried on a guerilla warfare against\r\nthe English republic, and seized many merchant and other vessels; but\r\nwhen Van Tromp made overtures to him to cede the islands to the States\r\nGeneral, and offered £100,000 as a bribe, Grenville indignantly refused\r\nto yield an inch of British soil to a stranger, saying he was there “to\r\ncontend against treason, not to imitate it.” Admiral Blake, who was in\r\npursuit of Van Tromp, next appeared, and again attempted negotiations\r\nfor the cession of the islands, but Grenville was resolved to hold them\r\nfor the King alone, and for a whole month made such a stubborn\r\nresistance that when at last Blake prevailed, Grenville secured terms so\r\nexceptionally favourable to the Royalists that the Parliament refused to\r\nratify them, till Blake insisted and threatened to resign his\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nSir John Grenville’s future career and the prominent part he took, in\r\nconjunction with his cousin, George Monk, in the Restoration of Charles\r\nII., who created him Earl of Bath, and showered countless honours and\r\nendowments upon him, do not belong to a paper confined to giving the\r\nfighting qualities of the family. These, however, found expression in\r\nhis two sons, Charles, Lord Lansdown, and John, afterwards created Lord\r\nGranville of Potheridge. The latter was in the navy, and took part in\r\nmost of the naval engagements of his time, behaving with great bravery\r\nand skill, particularly at the siege of Cork in 1690. Lord Lansdown took\r\npart in the wars of Hungary against the Turks, and was present at the\r\nbattle of Kornenberch, the siege of Vienna, at Baracan, Gran, and\r\nseveral smaller engagements, in all of which he displayed such unwonted\r\nvalour and intrepidity for one so young, that the Emperor Leopold, as a\r\nspecial mark of honour, created him a Count of the Holy Roman Empire,\r\nwith the distinction of bearing his paternal coat-of-arms upon the\r\nbreast of the Roman Eagle. He also took part in the constant reprisals,\r\nwhich marked the reign of William III., by the English and French upon\r\none another’s shores; and in one of these assisted in the bombardment of\r\nhis ancestral Norman town, Granville, and in another in the defence of\r\nTeignmouth and Torbay.\r\n\r\nThe fighting spirit of the family was still handed on in another member\r\nof the family—a second Sir Bevill, the eldest son of the Honourable\r\nBernard Granville (as the name was now spelt), who appears to have\r\ninherited all the courage of the grandfather whose name he bore. On\r\nleaving Cambridge, he entered the army, and served with distinction in\r\nhis uncle, Lord Bath’s, regiment in Ireland and Flanders, and was\r\nknighted by James II. at the head of that regiment on Hounslow Heath on\r\nthe 22nd of May, 1686. When Lord Bath revolted to the side of the Prince\r\nof Orange, Sir Bevill was despatched to Jersey to disarm the Papists and\r\nsecure the island—a mission which he carried out with complete success.\r\nAfter this he took part in the Continental war against the French, and\r\nbehaved with conspicuous bravery at the battle of Steinkirk, August 4th,\r\n1692. The battle was going against King William, when Prince Casimer of\r\nNassau, who was in command of the troops, galloped back to the English\r\nin his right rear, and begged them to advance, as Count Solmes refused\r\nto bring up his infantry. Rapidly forming Bath’s regiment, with the\r\npikes in the centre and the grenadiers and musketeers on either flank,\r\nSir Bevill put himself at its head, and, closely followed by the Buffs,\r\nmoved out from the line. He was only just in time. Baron Pibrach, the\r\nColonel of the Luxemburgers, had been desperately wounded whilst\r\nendeavouring to rally his men, who were flying in disorder, hotly\r\npursued by the French. Suddenly out of the crowd of fugitives hurrying\r\nto the rear there emerged a line of glistening steel, and Bath’s\r\nregiment, scarcely discernible from its foes in its scarlet stockings\r\nand breeches, its blue coats and buff cross-belts, strode sternly\r\nforward, its three red banners waving overhead. A hail of musket balls\r\nsmote it in the face; a storm of iron from the batteries mangled and\r\ntore its flanks; but it pressed irresistibly on, and amid a hurricane of\r\ncheers that drowned even the roar of the cannons, hurled the French\r\ninfantry from its path, and recovered the position. But only for a\r\nmoment. Again and again the French batteries worked up in dense masses\r\nalong Granville’s front, only to surge back again, rent and maimed by a\r\npitiless fire. So for another hour the carnage grew, till Prince\r\nCasimer, galloping to Granville’s side, gave him the order to retire. It\r\nwas six in the evening. The allied drums were everywhere beating the\r\nretreat. William had at last given up the struggle, and the columns were\r\nslowly winding to the rear. There was no pursuit. Sir Bevill’s gallantry\r\nwas long remembered and talked of with grateful admiration by the\r\nBritish camp fires.\r\n\r\nThis paper must now close with a brief quotation from a letter written\r\nby one who was the last but one of the representatives of this ancient\r\nhouse in the senior male line, namely, George Granville (younger brother\r\nof the last-mentioned Sir Bevill), afterwards created Baron Lansdown of\r\nBideford. Although no opportunity arose for him to distinguish himself\r\notherwise than in politics and as a poet, the old fighting spirit was\r\nnot lacking in him, and he was eager to gain his father’s permission to\r\ntake up arms against the Prince of Orange:—\r\n\r\n  Sir,—You having no prospect of obtaining a commission for me can no\r\n  way alter or cool my desire at this important juncture to venture my\r\n  life in some manner or other for my King and my country. I cannot bear\r\n  living under the reproach of lying obscure and idle in a country\r\n  retirement when every man, who has the least sense of honour, should\r\n  be preparing for the field. You may remember, Sir, with what\r\n  reluctance I submitted to your commands upon Monmouth’s rebellion,\r\n  when no importunity could prevail with you to permit me to leave the\r\n  Academy. I was “too young to be hazarded”; but give me leave to say it\r\n  is glorious at any age to die for one’s country, and the sooner, the\r\n  nobler the sacrifice. I am now older by three years. My uncle Bath was\r\n  not so old when he was left among the slain at the battle of Newbury,\r\n  nor you yourself, Sir, when you made your escape from your tutor’s to\r\n  join your brother at the defence of Scilly. The same cause is now come\r\n  round about again. The King has been misled; let those who have misled\r\n  him be answerable for it. Nobody can deny but he is sacred in his own\r\n  person, and it is every honest man’s duty to defend it. You are\r\n  pleased to say it is yet doubtful if the Hollanders are rash enough to\r\n  make such an attempt. But be that as it will, I beg leave to insist\r\n  upon it that I may be presented to his Majesty, as one whose utmost\r\n  ambition it is to devote his life to his service and my country’s,\r\n  after the example of my ancestors.\r\n\r\nNo unworthy extract, this, surely, wherewith to close the annals of six\r\ncenturies of stainless loyalty in a family whose motto has always been:\r\n“Deo, Patriæ, Amicis.”\r\n\r\n                                                    ROGER GRANVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR OF _BRITANNIA’S| PASTORALS_ AND TAVISTOCK.[5] | |BY THE REV.\r\nD. P. ALFORD, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf beautiful country could beget good poets, Tavistock ought to abound\r\nin them. For, on one side, there is Dartmoor, with its rugged grandeur,\r\nstretching out protecting arms to Brent Tor and Whitchurch Down; on the\r\nother side, there is the majestic Tamar, winding through its\r\ndeeply-wooded valley, from Latchley Weir, past New Bridge and the\r\nMorwell Rocks, to Gawton Quay; whilst through the midst, the sportive\r\nTavy runs down from its lonely cleave, and gathering up the Walla on its\r\nway, with bright and tawny waters, now creeps, now rushes past, to break\r\nthrough the beetling cliffs beyond Crowndale, and glide beneath the\r\nRamsham woods, to its happy meeting with the Walkham, and thence to the\r\ncopse-covered banks at Denham Bridge.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  _Chief authorities for this paper_: Dugdale and Oliver’s _Monasticon_;\r\n  old documents connected with Tavistock, recovered in ancient oak chest\r\n  in 1886; various papers on Tavistock Worthies, in the _Transactions of\r\n  the Devonshire Association_; Mr. A.

At all events, two hundred years later, Vicar Bray was\r\nversifying in the quiet seclusion of his vicarage, and inscribing his\r\nbest lines on slate slabs for the garden walls; and at the same time,\r\nMrs. Bray was writing her local tales in imitation of Scott, sending\r\nletters to Southey about the borders of the Tamar and Tavy, and\r\ncommending to his kindly notice her poetical _protegée_, the modest and\r\ngentle maid-servant, Mary Collins. Then, also, Miss Rachel Evans was\r\nwriting verse, as well as prose; and her brother-in-law, Mr. H. S.\r\nStokes, was beginning his career as a west-country poet here in\r\nTavistock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WEST VIEW OF TAVISTOCK ABBEY, 1734.\r\n  (_From an Engraving by S. and N.

He was a bright little man,\r\nbeloved by his brother-poets for his simple manners and gentle\r\ncharacter; such another as Hartley Coleridge, without his weakness of\r\nwill; so that he was known amongst them as “Bonny Browne” and “Sweet\r\nWilly of the Western Main.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Browne probably came of a knightly family near Great Torrington;\r\nbut he was born here in Tavistock in 1591—just the most stirring time\r\nfor minds and morals that England has ever known. The Reformation had\r\nstimulated the conscience, as the New Learning had liberated the mind;\r\nand then our wonderful deliverance from the mighty power of Spain had\r\nproduced an extraordinary national exultation. What wonder that this\r\nnewly-awakened energy should find expression in Spenser and Shakspere,\r\nin Hooker and Bacon, and their innumerable, not unworthy satellites?\r\n\r\nBut apart from the general excitement, Tavistock had its own special\r\natmosphere of stirring influences, both from the past and in the\r\npresent. The inscribed stones in the vicarage garden show that the\r\ncountry was occupied by a Gaelic tribe of Celts early in the Roman\r\ntimes. But the town owed its fame, and probably its very existence, to\r\nthe great Benedictine monastery, founded by Earl Ordulf, and sanctified\r\nby the relics of St. Rumon in the days of Edgar the Peaceable. For\r\nalmost six centuries it had reflected, and even, for a short while,\r\ndirectly influenced, through its abbots, the changeful course of\r\nEngland’s progress. Two of its earlier abbots were leading statesmen, as\r\nwell as active prelates. Lyfing, afterwards Bishop of Worcester, was\r\nCanute’s fellow-traveller to Rome in 1026, and the staunch friend of the\r\npatriotic Earl Godwin. Aldred, also Bishop of Worcester, and then\r\nArchbishop of York, was the wise counsellor of Edward the Confessor and\r\nof Harold, and the brave rebuker of William I.; he was the great\r\nchurch-builder and church-reformer of his time, and he was the first\r\nEnglish Bishop to visit Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nOur later abbots often illustrate public feeling, though they could not\r\nguide it as these two had done. Thus the general confusion at the close\r\nof Henry III.’s reign found such a bad sample in our monastery that\r\nAbbot John Chubbe was suspended in 1265, and deposed in 1269. The\r\ngrowing luxury and indifference of the fourteenth century was seen too\r\nplainly in Abbot John de Courtenay, who was reproved by the good Bishop\r\nGrandisson, in 1348, for neglecting his duties to the abbey and\r\nalienating its property, whilst he kept dogs for hunting. Bishop\r\nBrantyngham’s strong injunctions to Abbot Thomas Cullyng, in 1387, to\r\nrestore discipline and to keep the monastic rules, show that disorder\r\nand dissipation had been tending from bad to worse.\r\n\r\nBut there is a brighter side to this picture of the past, and most of\r\nour abbots were more learnedly or more clerically disposed. Some had\r\nbeen slowly collecting a good library—an early promise of the present\r\nPublic Library, the best, for the size of the town, in the West of\r\nEngland. Others had fostered the “Saxon School,” probably founded in the\r\nearly days of the thirteenth century, and still represented by the\r\nGrammar School. In the spring of 1318, under Abbot John Campbell, Bishop\r\nBronescombe consecrated the Parish Church, which had been rebuilt in the\r\nbeautiful Decorated style of the day; and in the autumn of the same\r\nyear, he came again to consecrate the Conventual Church, which, in its\r\ngrand proportions, was almost a rival of Exeter Cathedral. Under Robert\r\nBonus, in 1325, was established the Guild of the Brothers and Sisters of\r\nthe Light of St. Mary in the Parish Church; and in 1370, Abbot Stephen\r\nLangdon showed his concern for the good of the town by appealing to the\r\nfaithful to help in restoring the stone bridge over the rude waters of\r\nthe Tavy. John Denyngton probably rebuilt much of the Abbey in the\r\nPerpendicular style then in vogue; and he certainly added to his own\r\ndignity and to that of his monastery by gaining the permission of Henry\r\nVI., in 1458, to apply to the Pope, Pius II., for the privilege of\r\nwearing the pontificalia. This, our first mitred abbot, like his\r\npredecessor, Allan of Cornwall, two hundred years earlier, had come back\r\nto Tavistock from presiding over the dependent Priory of Tresco, in the\r\nIsles of Scilly. Abbot John Banham was more ambitious than Denyngton; in\r\n1513 a grant of Henry VIII. made him a spiritual peer, as Baron\r\nHurdwick, and four years later, a bull of Leo X. exempted him from\r\nepiscopal visitation. It was probably to Banham that the abbey owed an\r\nhonour more considerable and more in keeping with the spirit of the\r\nage—the setting up within its precincts of the first printing-press in\r\nthe West of England.\r\n\r\nBut the glory of our abbey had scarcely reached its height, before it\r\nfaded suddenly and for ever. Anticipating the blow which shattered the\r\nlarger monasteries in the spring of 1539, our abbot, John Peryn, not\r\nemulous of the fate of the abbots of Glastonbury, Woburn, and Fountains,\r\nassembled his twenty monks in the Chapter-house on March 20th, and then\r\nand there resigned all their claims into the hands of the King. For this\r\nready surrender they were rewarded with their lives and various\r\npensions. With his pension of £100 a year, the abbot withdrew to\r\nStonepost, in West Street, and was probably the “Sir John Peryn” who, in\r\n1543, was paid £6 as “Jesus’ Priest.”\r\n\r\nWhen William Browne was a lad, middle-aged men must have known the last\r\nAbbot of Tavistock; and old people could recall—the poorer sort with\r\nregretful sighs, the good old times, when the frequent services still\r\nsounded from the Abbey Church, and the monks distributed alms at the\r\narched gateway, beneath the present library. Even Browne himself, a\r\nchild of the Renaissance, who hated superstition and loved the Pagan\r\nmythology, could grudge the misuse of sacred buildings; and amongst\r\nother evils done by the Tavy in flood, he tells us how the stream—\r\n\r\n                Here, as our wicked age doth sacriledge,\r\n                Helpes downe an Abbey.\r\n\r\nBut though he was fond of Chaucer and our older poets, and though he\r\nfelt the influence of the stately ruins that surrounded his\r\nschool-house, he loved nature more than art, and was too full of present\r\nlife to care very much for the past. As a boy with boys, he would spend\r\nhis holidays breaking away from\r\n\r\n           An Orchard, whence by stealth he takes\r\n           A churlish Farmer’s Plums, sweet Peares or Grapes;\r\n\r\nchasing the “nimble Squirrel” in “Blanchdown Woods”; or, with his rod,\r\nfollowing his “native Tavy” in her “many mazes, intricate meanders.” But\r\nas thought came with years, he would be stealing away alone to cherish\r\nhis “Spring of Poesie” with Sidney’s _Sonnets_ or Spenser’s _Faërie\r\nQueen_, as he wandered over the “Dazied Downes” that “sweetly environed”\r\nhis home, or nestled beneath some shade in “Sweet Ina’s Combe,” half\r\nlulled to sleep by the Walla’s murmurings, or rousing himself to compose\r\n“the pleasing cadence of a line” in tune with those gentle murmurings.\r\n\r\nNor, indeed, had all the honour of Tavistock departed with the overthrow\r\nof her abbey. The Russells, who succeeded to the property, did not\r\nneglect the duties connected with it. They began—as they have\r\ncontinued—to maintain the religious and educational endowments. They\r\nsupplied the borough with statesmen for Members of Parliament, in the\r\ngenerous patriot, Lord William Russell, in Lord John, the leader of\r\nReform, and in the thoughtful, far-sighted Lord Arthur. They improved\r\nthe town with wide streets and public buildings, and, more recently,\r\nwith a fine statue, the first in the country, of Francis Drake.\r\n\r\nBrowne was but a little lad of five when his greatest townsman finished\r\nhis heroic course in a sea-grave off Nombre de Dios, in 1596; but he\r\nkept his exploits in remembrance, and presently celebrated him as the—\r\n\r\n                   —valiant, well-resolvèd Man,\r\n               Seeking new paths i’ th’ pathlesse Ocean.\r\n\r\nBesides the Drakes, there were several families of distinction in and\r\nabout Tavistock when Browne was a boy: there were Slannings, Kellys, and\r\nChampernownes near by; and in the parish, Glanvills, Maynards, Peeks,\r\nand Fitz.\r\n\r\nIn that year, 1596, there was born in the mansion at Fitzford the\r\ndaughter of John Fitz and Bridget Courtenay, who, as Lady Howard, was to\r\nbe so cruelly maligned by false rumours and fictitious romance. The\r\nfamily had been long settled at Fitzford, and a John Fitz was M.P. for\r\nTavistock in 1427. Lady Howard’s grandfather married Mary Sydenham, of\r\nBrympton, Somerset; and at the back of their quiet tomb in the Parish\r\nChurch is the kneeling figure of her father, Sir John Fitz. He was but a\r\nyouth of fifteen at his father’s death, in 1589; and his riotous, wasted\r\nlife was an ironical commentary on his kneeling posture. After a wild\r\nand reckless youth, in 1699, when he was twenty-five, he killed Nicholas\r\nSlanning, of Bickley, in a cowardly brawl. Coming home from a short\r\nsojourn abroad, he was more quiet for a while; but presently, returning\r\nfrom London, whither he had gone to be knighted at the Coronation of\r\nJames I., he was more dissipated than ever. He drove his wife and\r\ndaughters to seek refuge at Powderham, and upset the usually decent\r\nparish with drunkenness and disorder. At last, on a second journey to\r\nLondon, in a fit of mad panic, he killed the innkeeper at Twickenham,\r\nand then so stabbed himself that he died in a few days.\r\n\r\nHis nine-year-old daughter, the prey of greedy guardians, after being\r\nforced into early marriages, enjoyed some years of wedded happiness with\r\nher third husband, Sir Charles Howard, fourth son of the Earl of\r\nSuffolk. Then, having suffered years of neglect and annoyance from her\r\nfourth husband, the clever soldier, but treacherous politician, Sir\r\nRichard, brother of the chivalrous Sir Bevil Grenville, at last, after\r\nFitzford had been sacked by the Roundheads, and her husband had fled the\r\ncountry, she settled down in her old home for twenty-five quiet years,\r\nfrom 1646 to 1671. Her son, George Howard, managed her property, joined\r\nher in such local contributions as that, in 1670, for the “redemption of\r\ncaptives in Turkey,” and represented Tavistock with Lord William Russell\r\nin 1660. But as he died some weeks before her, Lady Howard left her\r\nlarge estates bordering the Tavy, the mansion of Fitzford, the pleasant\r\ncountry house of Walreddon, with many goodly farms, Browne’s favourite\r\nRamsham amongst them, to her first cousin, Sir William Courtenay, of\r\nPowderham.\r\n\r\nIt was about the year 1606 that William Browne left the Grammar School\r\nfor Exeter College, Oxford. He did not then matriculate or take his\r\ndegree, but he made friends with his colleagues, several of whom showed\r\ntheir poetical taste in commendatory verses to his _Pastorals_ in 1613.\r\nMeanwhile, in November, 1611, Browne had passed on to the Inner Temple,\r\nwhere he largely increased his poetical acquaintance. He was on good\r\nterms with Ben Jonson, Chapman, and Massinger amongst our dramatists,\r\nand was therefore probably known to Shakspere; but his most intimate\r\nfriends were John Davies, the able author of _Nosce Teipsum_;\r\nChristopher Brooke, the close ally of the famous poet and preacher, John\r\nDonne; George Wither, and Michael Drayton. He and Brooke, in 1613,\r\npublished in one volume their elegies on the death of Prince Henry. He\r\nhad much in common with the early poems of Wither: their _Pastorals_\r\nexhibit the same charming simplicity, the same full content in\r\nverse-making, the same indifference to irresponsive maidens. These lines\r\nof Browne:—\r\n\r\n         And gentle Swaine, some counsel take of me;\r\n         Love not where still thou maist; love who loves thee;\r\n\r\nstrike the same note as that of Wither’s spirited song:—\r\n\r\n                      Shall I wasting in despair,\r\n                      Die because a woman’s fair?\r\n                         .   .   .   .   .   .\r\n                      If she be not so to me,\r\n                      What care I how fair she be?\r\n\r\nTo Drayton, as his “Honor’d Friend,” Browne addressed some verses\r\nintroductory to the second part of the _Polyolbion_. Regretting the loss\r\nto letters when great Eliza died, with Chapman’s _Homer_ in mind, he\r\nboasts that we can still render the classics into English without loss:—\r\n\r\n              Whilst our full language, musical and high,\r\n              Speaks, as themselves, their best of Poesy.\r\n\r\nBrowne’s regret at the general falling-off since the death of Elizabeth\r\nsuggests that the verses in her honour, which were removed with the\r\nplastering from Tavistock Parish Church in 1845, may have been amongst\r\nhis earliest efforts. They ended with these flattering words:—\r\n\r\n       This! This was she, that in despite of Death,\r\n       Lives still ador’d, admir’d Elizabeth.\r\n       Spain’s rod, Rome’s ruin, Netherland’s relief;\r\n       Heaven’s gem, Earth’s joy, World’s wonder, Nature’s chief.\r\n\r\nBrowne’s elegy on Prince Henry was reprinted as one of the songs in the\r\nfirst book of his _Britannia’s Pastorals_, which was also published in\r\n1613, with commendatory verses from Drayton and Brooke and the learned\r\nSelden, besides those from his college friends. In doing the same kindly\r\noffice for the second book, in 1616, Ben Jonson spoke thus highly of the\r\ncare and finish of Browne’s work:—\r\n\r\n                                     which is so good\r\n        Upon th’ Exchange of Letters, that I wou’d\r\n        More of our Writers would, like thee, not swell\r\n        With the _how much_ they set forth, but th’ _how well_.\r\n\r\nOther verses prefixed to this book came from Tavistock, and were written\r\nby Sir John Glanvill, probably Browne’s relation, and an old\r\nschoolfellow.\r\n\r\nAfter the Fitz, the Glanvill family was the most important in Tavistock.\r\nSettled at Holwell, in Whitchurch, for many generations, about 1550 they\r\nsent a younger son into the town as a merchant. His son, John, passed\r\nfrom an attorney’s office to the Bar, and in 1598, two years before his\r\ndeath, he was made a Justice of the Common Pleas. In 1615, the fine\r\nJacobean monument against the south wall of the chancel was erected to\r\nhis memory by his widow, probably in gratitude to her sons, who in that\r\nyear had conveyed to her Sortridge, her own family estate, also in\r\nWhitchurch, probably forfeited by her second marriage; for in the\r\ninterval she had married Sir Francis Godolphin, and become a second time\r\na widow. She occupied a dower house in Barley Market Street, and her\r\nsecond name still lingers in the “Dolvin Road,” across the Tavy. The\r\nJudge, Prince tells us, lived in part of the Abbey, this being, most\r\nlikely, the Abbey House, which Oliver says was occupied in 1635 by\r\nSerjeant Maynard. The Barton at Kilworthy was bought by Judge Glanvill,\r\nbut it was his eldest son, Sir Francis, who built the mansion and laid\r\nout the terrace gardens, of which some charming portions are still in\r\nuse. This Sir Francis Glanvill sat, as M.P. for Tavistock, in 1625 and\r\n1628, with the great Commoner, John Pym. On January 21st, 1626, his son,\r\nFrancis, was baptized at Mary Tavy, by reason of the plague raging so\r\nfiercely at Tavistock. So dreadful was the scourge, that six hundred\r\npeople died in twelve months; and the little town had scarcely recovered\r\nits normal population in a hundred and fifty years. The younger Francis\r\ndying without issue, left Kilworthy to his nephew, Francis Kelly; and he\r\nleft it to the Manatons, who held it till it was bought by the Russells\r\nabout 1770. By his sisters, daughters, and grand-daughters, Judge\r\nGlanvill’s family became allied to the Brownes, Hamlyns, and Glubbs of\r\nTavistock, the Grylls of Launceston, to Heles, Eastcourts, and\r\nPolwheles; to the Fowells, the Sawles of Penrice, and the Doidges of\r\nHurlesditch; besides the Kellys and Manatons. One of his sisters was the\r\nsecond wife of Robert Knight, probably the first _married_ Vicar of\r\nTavistock; and his third son, George, was Vicar from 1662 to 1673.\r\n\r\nSir John Glanvill, the second son, was equally distinguished in law and\r\npolitics. He was made Recorder of Plymouth in 1614, Serjeant in 1637,\r\nand Recorder of Bristol in 1640. As M.P. for Plymouth from 1614 to 1628,\r\nhe was attached to the country party with Elliott and Pym, and he had\r\ncharge of the Petition of Right before the Lords. Returned for Bristol\r\nin 1640, he was chosen Speaker of the Short Parliament, as a man of\r\nreasonable judgment and soothing speech; but having joined the King at\r\nOxford in 1643, from 1645 to 1648 he was imprisoned in the Tower as a\r\ndelinquent. He was re-appointed King’s Serjeant at the Restoration, and\r\ndied soon after at Broad Hinton, his estate in Wiltshire. It was this\r\nworthy fellow-townsman who, in 1616, addressed William Browne in verses\r\noverflowing with kindly appreciation, and beginning:—\r\n\r\n            Ingenious Swaine! that highly dost adorne\r\n            Clear Tavy! on whose brinck we both were borne!\r\n\r\nAnother eminent fellow-townsman, John Maynard, might have been with\r\nBrowne at the Grammar School, and certainly followed him to Exeter\r\nCollege and to the Inns of Court. Like Sir John Glanvill, Maynard was a\r\nman of mark, both in law and politics; but he was more of a time-server.\r\nHe was clever enough to be leader of the Western Circuit during fifty of\r\nthe most turbulent years of our annals. He was “Protector’s Serjeant”\r\nunder Cromwell; “Ancient Serjeant” under Charles II. and James II.; and\r\n“Lord Commissioner” after the Revolution of 1688. He also sat in every\r\nParliament from the first of Charles I. to the first of William and\r\nMary. He was presented to the new King at Whitehall when he was nearly\r\nninety; and William observed that he must have outlived all the lawyers\r\nof his time. “Yes, sire,” he promptly replied; “and if your Highness had\r\nnot come over to help us, I should have outlived the law, too.” As\r\nMaynard took part both in the impeachment of Strafford and also of Sir\r\nHenry Vane, it is no wonder that Roscommon, Strafford’s nephew and\r\ngodson, should write of him:—\r\n\r\n              The robe was summoned, Maynard at the head,\r\n              In legal murder none so deeply read;\r\n\r\nor that the author of _Hudibras_ should enquire, in his witty doggrel:—\r\n\r\n              Did not the learned Glynne and Maynard,\r\n              To make good subjects traitors, strain hard?\r\n\r\nIt is to Maynard’s credit that he spent part of his fortune in founding\r\na free school at Bere Alston, which he had represented in Parliament.\r\nMaynard and Courtenay are names still pleasantly associated in Tavistock\r\nwith provision for the deserving poor, in convenient almshouses; whilst\r\nan exhibition to help some “Grammar scholar,” “of the best ingenuity and\r\ntowardliness,” on his way to the University, is a lasting memorial of\r\nSir John Glanvill.\r\n\r\nIn 1626, Browne probably received from another old schoolfellow, Richard\r\nPeeke, a copy of his _Three to One_, a short and vigorous account of his\r\nrecent exploits in Spain. This Richard Peeke, a gentleman of good family\r\nin Tavistock, had volunteered, in 1625, for the ill-starred expedition\r\nto Cadiz, and being taken prisoner, by his prowess in defeating three\r\nfully-armed Spaniards with a quarter-staff, had won his life and\r\nliberty, and was presently celebrated in ballads as “Manly Peeke,” and\r\nin a fine old play as “Dick of Devonshire.” He was invited by King\r\nPhilip IV. to serve him by land or sea, but Peeke said he must return to\r\nthe wife and children who were sighing for him in Tavistock; so he came\r\nback to settle down quietly in the old home, and, as one of our pewter\r\nflagons tells, he was churchwarden in 1638.\r\n\r\nAnd what was William Browne doing all this time? In 1614 he had written\r\nhis masque of “Ulysses and Circe” for the Inner Temple, where it was\r\nperformed 13th January, 1614–5. The subject may have been suggested by\r\nChapman’s _Odyssey_, printed in 1614, or by Samuel Daniel’s lyric,\r\n“Ulysses and the Siren” (1605), and it is more than likely that Browne’s\r\nmasque gave Milton some hints for his “Comus.” In 1614 he also\r\ncontributed seven Eclogues to the “Shepheard’s Pipe,” the other\r\ncontributors being C. Brooke, Davies, and Wither. Browne worked into his\r\nfirst Eclogue the “Jonathas” of the little-known Occleve, and the fourth\r\nis an Elegy on Thomas, the son of Sir Peter Manwood.\r\n\r\nOur little and learned poet, as Prince describes him, is said to have\r\nbeen appointed, in 1615, Pursuivant of Wards and Liveries for life. He\r\nmarried a daughter of Sir Thomas Eversfield, and had two sons, who both\r\ndied young. In 1624 he returned to Oxford as tutor to the Hon. Robert\r\nDormer, afterwards Earl of Carnarvon, who was killed at Newbury in 1643.\r\nBrowne, being thirty-three, matriculated from Exeter College on 30th\r\nApril, 1624, and on 16th November took his M.A., being commended for his\r\nknowledge of humane letters and the fine arts. He seems to have gone\r\nabroad with his pupil, and in 1640 he wrote from Dorking to Sir Benjamin\r\nRuddyerd, congratulating him on his “late speech in Parliament, wherein\r\nthey believe the spirit which inspired the Reformation, and genius which\r\ndictated the Magna Charta, possessed you. In my poore cell and\r\nsequestration from all businesse, I blesse God and praye for more such\r\nmembers in the Commonwealth.” Anthony Wood says he was afterwards\r\ndomesticated with the Herberts at Wilton, and prospered there; and it\r\nhas been fairly proved that he, and not Ben Jonson, wrote that most\r\nperfect epitaph on the Countess of Pembroke:—\r\n\r\n                  Underneath this sable hearse\r\n                  Lies the subject of all verse,\r\n                  Sidney’s sister, Pembroke’s mother;\r\n                  Death! ere thou hast slain another,\r\n                  Learn’d and fair, and good as she,\r\n                  Time will throw a dart at thee.\r\n\r\nWe do not know when or where our poet ended his days, but if, oppressed\r\nwith sorrow or sickness, he turned with longing to the native scenes\r\nwhich in early youth he had loved so well, it is likely enough that he\r\nis referred to in the simple entry of the Tavistock register:—“27th\r\nMarch, 1643, William Browne was buried.”\r\n\r\nAs poets will, Browne went on writing all through life, but he published\r\nnothing new after 1616. He left in MS. a third book of the Pastorals,\r\nwhich was first printed in 1852, and a number of smaller poems, sonnets,\r\nepistles, visions, allegories, epigrams, epitaphs, and some jocular\r\npieces. Amongst the last were the Lydford stanzas, which contained the\r\nfirst notice of the wild Gubbingses, and the sharp satire on Lydford\r\nLaw; about 1630 they were “commonly sung by many a fiddler” as a\r\nDevonshire ballad.\r\n\r\nWhy did Browne print nothing new after 1616? He had not lost the poetic\r\ngift, for much that he left in MS. is as good as anything he ever wrote.\r\nWe have examples in the first and second songs of the third book of the\r\nPastorals, and nothing that he published is brighter than the song in\r\nthe Lansdowne MS. with the pleasant refrain:\r\n\r\n                   Welcome! Welcome! do I sing!\r\n                   Far more welcome than the Spring!\r\n                   He that parteth from you never,\r\n                   Shall enjoy a Spring for ever!”\r\n\r\nIn truth, William Browne was, as his friend Drayton styled him, “a\r\nrightly-born Poet.” If, like the “Faërie Queene,” his Pastorals are\r\nvague and diffuse in narrative, and deficient in human interest, yet,\r\nlike the “Faërie Queene,” they abound in happy visions, and fine\r\ndescriptions, and wholesome thoughts, expressed in easy, flowing melody.\r\nBrowne was akin to Keats and Tennyson in his love of well-sounding words\r\nand sonorous lines. It gave him keen pleasure—\r\n\r\n               To linger on each line’s enticing graces.\r\n\r\nAnd his enjoyment of the simple beauties of nature was as true and\r\nheartfelt as Cowper’s. Vivid pictures of country scenes, and homely\r\nsketches of country life, are presented to us again and again in verse\r\nthat is always clear and lucid, though soft and sweet, or rough and\r\nrugged, according to the subject. His carefully-constructed verses, in\r\ntheir clearness and in their varying tone, would really seem to have\r\nbeen attuned to the “voiceful Tavy” which he loved so dearly and\r\ncelebrated so gladly, and by whose side many of them were written.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, with such a gift, so obviously unexhausted, did he decline to\r\npublish anything after the appearance of the second book of _Britannia’s\r\nPastorals_, in 1616? Probably he felt, as S. Daniel had felt before him,\r\nthat a people entirely devoted to action and incident could have little\r\ntaste for pure poetry. Even as early as 1613 he had described a poor\r\npoet, sitting up late, wasting ink and paper, and wearing out “many a\r\ngray goose quill,” in the vain hope of immortal renown:—\r\n\r\n        When Loe! (O Fate!) his worke not seeming fit\r\n        To walk in equipage with better wit,\r\n        Is kept from light, there gnawne by Moathes and Wormes,\r\n        At which he frets.\r\n\r\nAnd, in 1623, when he wrote his commendatory verses for Massinger’s\r\n_Duke of Millaine_, he was convinced that there was no demand for any\r\npoetry but the drama:—\r\n\r\n           I am snapt already, and may go my way;\r\n           The Poet-Critic’s come; I hear him say:\r\n           This Youth’s mistook, the Author’s work’s a Play.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to make a pleasant little volume of selections from the\r\nmore striking or more beautiful passages in Browne’s Pastorals, but here\r\nwe can hardly find room for half-a-dozen specimens. Of death he writes:—\r\n\r\n              Death is no stranger,\r\n              And generous Spirits never fear for danger.\r\n\r\nOf cheerful content:—\r\n\r\n               Where there’s content, ’tis ever Holy-day.\r\n\r\nOf the Good Shepherd he says that from\r\n\r\n                                   the stem\r\n             Of that sweet singer of Jerusalem,\r\n             Came the best Shepherd ever flocks did keepe,\r\n             Who yeelded up his life to save his sheepe.\r\n\r\nIn Book 2 we have such satire as this, of the “fawning citizen,”\r\n\r\n            Who “lives a Knave to leave his sonne a Knight”;\r\n\r\nsuch strong lines as this of the sea:—\r\n\r\n               The vast insatiate Sea doth still devour;\r\n\r\nsuch vivid pictures as this:—\r\n\r\n             The whistling Reeds upon the water’s side,\r\n             Shot up their sharpe heads in a stately pride;\r\n\r\nor sweetly-soothing verses like these, on the stillness of nightfall:—\r\n\r\n           Onely the curled Streames soft chidings kept;\r\n           And little Gales that from the greene leafe swept\r\n           Dry summer dust, in fearefull whisp’rings stir’d,\r\n           As loth to waken any singing bird.\r\n\r\nSuch passages as these must be admired by every lover of nature, but the\r\npoet will always be doubly dear to those who have lived amongst the\r\nscenes he describes so tenderly and so faithfully. My own feeling of\r\nindebtedness to one whose poetry had given a sort of sacredness to his\r\nnative haunts was thus expressed when I was in clerical charge of the\r\nTamar side of Tavistock, more than thirty years ago:—\r\n\r\n          Nature’s true Poet, blest with fancies sweet,\r\n          And voice as swift and changeful as our brooks,\r\n          We country swains cast often wondering looks\r\n          On those great singers that around thee meet;\r\n          For Spenser, Sidney, thy chief teachers were,\r\n          And Wither, Drayton, Jonson, called thee friend;\r\n          And, like enough, kind Shakespere did commend\r\n          Thy “modest muse.” And yet, we all may share\r\n          The scenes of beauty that inspired thy lay;\r\n          For still, by “Blanchdown Wood” the Tamar sweeps;\r\n          Still trickle streamlets down the “Dartmoor” steeps,\r\n          And sing blithe music to the lambs at play;\r\n          Still through “sweet Ina’s Combe” the Walla leaps,\r\n          Hurrying to greet the Tavy on its way.\r\n\r\n                                                       D. P. ALFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE BLOWING UP OF GREAT\r\n                           TORRINGTON CHURCH.\r\n\r\n                           BY GEORGE M. DOE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe town of Great Torrington played a not inconspicuous part in the\r\nCivil Wars, the culminating and dramatic incident of which was the\r\nblowing up of the Parish Church after the defeat and flight of the\r\nRoyalist forces who were then in the town. The fight at Torrington, too,\r\nwas the last important engagement of the campaign in the West, being the\r\nfinal decisive blow to the Royalist cause there. A very accurate and\r\nfull account of the whole of the doings in North Devon during this\r\nstirring time is to be found in the late Mr. R. W. Cotton’s invaluable\r\nwork on _Barnstaple and the Northern part of Devonshire during the Great\r\nCivil War_, 1642–1646, and the incidents more particularly relating to\r\nGreat Torrington were collected by me and embodied in a little book\r\nentitled, _A few Pages of Great Torrington History_, 1642–1646, and the\r\nblowing up of the Church is also dealt with in my paper in the\r\n_Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the year 1894_.\r\n\r\nThough of far less importance than the final battle, there were two\r\nother previous engagements at Great Torrington. The first of these took\r\nplace in December, 1642, when a party of Parliamentarian horse and foot\r\nfrom Barnstaple attacked the Royalists then in the town. From the\r\nvarying accounts given by each party, it is, however, uncertain which\r\nside came off best in the encounter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT TORRINGTON CHURCH (OLD).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT TORRINGTON CHURCH (NEW).]\r\n\r\nThere are entries of burials in the Parish Register of Great Torrington\r\nof this date, one being that of Christopher Awberry, a trooper of Sir\r\nRalph Hopton, who was killed by the “goeing off of a muskett unawares\r\nupon the maine gard,” and was buried “Souldier Like,” and another of\r\nThomas Hollamore, “slaine by ye goeing off of a muskett.”\r\n\r\nIn the next year another attack was made on the Royalist forces under\r\nColonel Digby in Great Torrington, resulting in a fight on the Commons\r\non the north side of the town, in which the attacking force was\r\nrepulsed. A description of this engagement is given by Lord Clarendon in\r\nhis _History of the Rebellion_.\r\n\r\nBetween this last date and that of the blowing up of the Church, there\r\nis the following interesting entry in the Register of Burials of July,\r\n1644:—\r\n\r\n  Thomas Moncke gent. lieuetennt to Colonell Thomas Moncke of Poderidge\r\n  Esq beeing slaine in South Streete the IX^{th} day about 12^{th} a\r\n  ’clocke att night by somme of his owne company by reason of some\r\n  misprision of the word given being the IX^{th} day att 12^{th}\r\n  aforesaid was buried the 10^{th} day.\r\n\r\nThe “Colonell Thomas Moncke” in this entry was the father of the\r\nunfortunate lieutenant, and brother of the celebrated George Monk, Duke\r\nof Albemarle and Earl of Torrington, who subsequently played the leading\r\npart in the Restoration of King Charles II. Potheridge, in the parish of\r\nMerton, which is now converted into a farm-house, was the family seat of\r\nthe Monks.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Monday, the 16th February, 1645, the Parliamentarian\r\nArmy, with Fairfax as General and Cromwell Lieutenant-General, marched\r\nfrom Ashreingney viâ Stevenstone, reaching Great Torrington late in the\r\nevening, and after some hard fighting in the dark succeeded in forcing\r\ntheir way into the town and driving the Royalist soldiers, under Lord\r\nHopton, through the streets and across the Torridge in the direction of\r\nCornwall. Hardly had the victors effected an entrance, before the\r\nChurch, which had been used by the Royalists as a magazine for their\r\npowder, was blown up, the explosion wrecking the surrounding houses and\r\ndealing ruin and destruction in all directions.\r\n\r\nThere are several very graphic accounts of the catastrophe and the\r\nincidents immediately leading up to it, by eye witnesses, which cannot\r\nbe excelled in accurate and vivid description by any additional\r\nembellishments. The following is that of Joshua Sprigge, the chaplain of\r\nFairfax:—\r\n\r\n  Monday, February 16th, the drums beat by four of the clock in the\r\n  Morning; the general rendezvous of the army was appointed to be at\r\n  Rings-Ash, about three miles from Chimleigh; where, accordingly, by\r\n  seven of the clock in the morning, the whole army was drawn up in\r\n  battalia, horse and foot, on the moor five miles short of Torrington,\r\n  and so marched in order ready for a present engagement, in case the\r\n  enemy should attempt any thing in our march through the narrow lanes;\r\n  the forlorn hope of horse, commanded by major Stephens and Captain\r\n  Moleneux, being advanced towards Stephenston (master Rolls’ house near\r\n  Torrington), his excellency understood that the enemy had 200 dragoons\r\n  in the House, whereupon a commanded party of horse and foot were sent\r\n  to fall on them; but upon the advance of our forces towards them, the\r\n  enemy quit the place; yet our horse marching fast, engaged their rear,\r\n  took several of their dragoons prisoners, and afterwards the forlorn\r\n  hope of horse on both sides were much engaged in the narrow and dirty\r\n  lanes; at last we beat them from master Rolls’ house, all along the\r\n  lane almost to Torrington. About five of the clock in the evening the\r\n  van of the army was drawn up in the park, the forlorn hope of foot was\r\n  drawn out near the forlorn hope of horse in the midway, between master\r\n  Rolls’ house and Torrington, and there lined the hedges to make good\r\n  the retreat of the horse; the enemy likewise drew out of the town four\r\n  or five closes off, and lined the hedges with musketeers within a\r\n  close of ours, and flanked their foot with horse; whereupon good\r\n  reserves were sent to second our forlorn hope of foot, lest the enemy,\r\n  knowing the ground, and we being strangers unto it, might suddenly\r\n  encompass us (it being by this time dark night, and the whole army\r\n  being then come up, having marched ten miles that day). About eight at\r\n  night the enemy drew off from some of the closes they formerly\r\n  possessed; whereupon we gained the ground they quitted, and a council\r\n  of war being called, whether it was advisable, being night, to engage\r\n  the enemy’s body, then in the town, who were ready with the best\r\n  advantages of ground and barricadoes to receive us; it was the general\r\n  sense of the council to make good our ground and double our guards\r\n  till the next morning, that we might the better take view of the\r\n  places where we were like to engage; whereupon the general and\r\n  lieutenant-general went from master Rolls’ house to see the guards\r\n  accordingly set, but, hearing a noise in the town, as if the enemy\r\n  were retreating, and being loath that they should go away without an\r\n  affront, to that purpose, and that we might get certain knowledge\r\n  whether they were going off or not, a small party of dragoons were\r\n  sent to fire on the enemy near the barricadoes and hedges. The enemy\r\n  answered us with a round volley of shot; thereupon the forlorn hope of\r\n  foot went and engaged themselves to bring off the dragoons, and the\r\n  reserve fell on to bring off the forlorn hope; and being thus far\r\n  engaged, the general being on the field, and seeing the general\r\n  resolution of the soldiery, held fit that the whole regiments in order\r\n  after them should fall on. And so both sides were accordingly engaged\r\n  in the dark for some two hours, till we beat them from the hedges and\r\n  within their barricadoes, which were very strong, and where some of\r\n  their men disputed the entrance of our forces with push of pike and\r\n  butt-end of musket for a long time. At last it pleased God to give us\r\n  the victory, our foot first entering the town, and afterwards the\r\n  horse, who chased the enemy through the town, the Lord Hopton,\r\n  bringing up the rear, had his horse shot dead under him in the middle\r\n  of the town, their horse once facing about in the street, caused our\r\n  foot to retreat, but more of our horse coming up pursued them to the\r\n  bridges, and through the other barricadoes at the further end of the\r\n  town, where we had no sooner placed guards at the several avenues, and\r\n  had drawn our whole army of foot and most of our horse into the town,\r\n  but the magazine of near eighty barrels of powder, which the lord\r\n  Hopton had in the church, was fired by a desperate villain, one Watts,\r\n  whom the enemy had hired with thirty pounds for that purpose, as he\r\n  himself confessed the next day, when he was pulled out from under the\r\n  rubbish and timber, and the lead, stones, timber, and iron work of the\r\n  church were blown up into the air and scattered all over the town and\r\n  fields about it where our forces were; yet it pleased God miraculously\r\n  to preserve the army, that few were slain besides the enemy’s (that\r\n  were prisoners in the church where the magazine was blown up), and\r\n  most of our men that guarded them who were killed and buried in the\r\n  ruins: and here was God’s great mercy unto us, that the general being\r\n  there in the streets escaped with his life so narrowly, there falling\r\n  a web of lead with all its force which killed the horse of one master\r\n  Rhoads of the lifeguard who was thereon next to the general in the\r\n  street, but doing neither him nor the general any hurt. There were\r\n  taken in the town about 600 prisoners besides officers, great store of\r\n  arms (the lanes and fields being bestrewn with them), all their foot\r\n  were scattered, their horse fled that night towards Cornwall in great\r\n  confusion: the prisoners we took confessed they had about 4,000 foot\r\n  and 4,000 horse at least; the service was very hot, we had many\r\n  wounded, it was stoutly maintained on both sides for the time.\r\n\r\nFrom other sources we learn that the main body of the Royalist Horse was\r\nstationed at the end of the barricade on the north side of the town, and\r\nthe Prince’s Guards were in the Castle Green. The word for the night\r\nwas, “We are with you,” and the signal was a handkerchief tied round the\r\nright arm. The word for the night of the Parliamentarian Army was,\r\n“Emmanuel, God with us,” and each man carried a sprig of furze in his\r\nhat.\r\n\r\nFairfax himself also gives a detailed account of the affair in a letter\r\nto the Speaker of the House of Commons, in which he says:—\r\n\r\n  Accordingly on Monday morning I drew out the army to an early\r\n  rendezvous at Ring-Ash, within six miles of the enemy; the weather\r\n  still continued very wet and so by all signs was like to hold till we\r\n  advanced from the rendezvous; but suddenly, when we were upon march,\r\n  it, beyond all expectation, began to be fair and dry, and so continued\r\n  whereas we had scarce seen one fair blast for many days before. The\r\n  enemy (as we understood by the way), had all their horses drawn\r\n  together about Torrington, and with their foot prepared to defend the\r\n  town, which they had fortified with good barricadoes of earth cast up\r\n  at every avenue, and a competent line patched up round about it, their\r\n  horse standing by to flank the same, and some within to scour the\r\n  streets. Our forlorn hope had order to advance to Stephenson-park,\r\n  about a mile from the town, and there to stay for the drawing up of\r\n  the army, there being no other place fit for that purpose nearer to\r\n  the town on that side we came on. But when we came near we understood\r\n  that the enemy had with 200 dragoons possessed the house in the park,\r\n  and were fortifying it, being of itself very strong, but upon our\r\n  nearer approach their dragoons quitted the house, and our forlorn hope\r\n  falling on them took many prisoners and pursuing them near the town\r\n  were engaged so far as they could not well draw back to the park which\r\n  occasioned to sending up of stronger parties to make them good where\r\n  they were, or bring them off; and at last there being some fear that\r\n  the enemy would draw about them and hem them in, Colonel Hammond was\r\n  sent up with three regiments of foot, being his own, Colonel Harlow’s,\r\n  and mine, and some more horse to lie for reserves unto them, by which\r\n  time the night was grown on so that it was not thought fit unless the\r\n  enemy appeared to be drawing away to attempt anything further upon the\r\n  town till morning, in regard none of us knew the ground nor the\r\n  advantages or disadvantages of it; but about nine of the clock, there\r\n  being some apprehension of the enemy’s drawing away, by reason of\r\n  their drawing back some outguards, small parties were sent out towards\r\n  the town’s end to make a certain discovery which going very near their\r\n  works before the enemy made any firing, but being at last entertained\r\n  with a great volley of shot and thereupon supposed to be engaged,\r\n  stronger parties were sent up to relieve them, and after them the\r\n  three regiments went up for reserves, till at last they fell on in\r\n  earnest. After very hot firings, our men coming up to the barricadoes\r\n  and line, the dispute continued long at push of pike and with\r\n  butt-ends of muskets till at last it pleased God to make the enemy fly\r\n  from their works, and give our men the entrance; after which our men\r\n  were twice repulsed by their horse and almost all driven out again,\r\n  but colonel Hammond, with some other officers and a few soldiers, made\r\n  a stop at the barricadoes, and, so making good their re-entrance,\r\n  rallied their men, and went on again, major Stephens with their\r\n  forlorn hope of horse coming seasonably up to second them: the enemy’s\r\n  foot ran several ways, most of them leaving their arms, but most of\r\n  their officers, with the assistance of horse, made good their own\r\n  retreat out of the town towards the bridge, and taking the advantage\r\n  of strait passages, to make often stands against our men, gave time\r\n  for many of their foot to get over the bridge; their horse without the\r\n  town, after some attempts at other avenues to have broken in again\r\n  upon us, being repulsed, at last went all away over another bridge,\r\n  and at several other passes of the river, and all fell westward; the\r\n  ground where their horse had stood and the bridge they went over lying\r\n  so beyond the town, as our horse could not come at them but through\r\n  the town, which, by reason of strait passages through several\r\n  barricadoes, was very tedious, by means whereof, and by reason of\r\n  continued strait lanes the enemy had to retreat by, after they were\r\n  over the river, as also by the advantage of the night, and by their\r\n  perfect knowledge of the country and our ignorance therein, our horse\r\n  could do little execution upon the pursuit, but parties being sent out\r\n  several ways to follow them, as those disadvantages would admit, did\r\n  the best they could, and brought back many prisoners and horses. We\r\n  took many prisoners in the town, who, being put into the church where\r\n  the enemy’s magazine lay, of above fourscore barrels of powder, as is\r\n  reported, besides other ammunition either purposely by some desperate\r\n  prisoner, or casually by some soldier, the powder was fired, whereby\r\n  the church was quite blown up, the prisoners and most of our men that\r\n  guarded them were killed and overwhelmed in the ruins; the houses of\r\n  the town shaken and shattered, and our men all the town over much\r\n  endangered by the stones, timber, and lead, which with the blast were\r\n  carried up very high, and scattered in great abundance all the town\r\n  over and beyond; yet it pleased God that few of our men were slain or\r\n  hurt thereby, save those in the church only, our loss of men otherwise\r\n  in this service was small, though many wounded, it being a hotter\r\n  service than any storm this army hath before been upon, wherein God\r\n  gave our men great resolution; and colonel Hammond especially, and\r\n  other officers engaged with him, behaved themselves with much\r\n  resolution, courage and diligence, recovering the ground after their\r\n  men were twice repulsed; of prisoners taken in this service about 200\r\n  were blown up, 200 have taken up arms with us, and about 200 more\r\n  common soldiers remain prisoners: besides many officers, gentlemen,\r\n  and servants, not many slain, but their foot so dispersed as that of\r\n  about 3,000, which the most credible persons do affirm they had there,\r\n  and we find, by a list taken among the lord Hopton’s papers,\r\n  themselves did account them more, we cannot hear of above 400 that\r\n  they carried off with them into Cornwall, whither their horse also are\r\n  gone, being much broken and dispersed as well as their foot. By the\r\n  considerations and circumstances in this business which I have here\r\n  touched upon, you will perceive whose hand it was that led us to it,\r\n  and gave such success in it, and truly there were many more evident\r\n  appearances of the good hand of God therein than I can set forth: let\r\n  all the honour be to Him alone for ever.\r\n\r\nA letter of John Rushworth, the Secretary to Fairfax, written at\r\nTorrington on the 22nd of February, 1645–6, states that:—\r\n\r\n  The other day, being the market day, Master Peters preacht unto the\r\n  country people and souldiers in Torrington (the Church being blown up)\r\n  he was forced to preach out of a belcony, where the audience was\r\n  great: he made a great impression upon the hearts of the people.\r\n\r\nThis was the celebrated Hugh Peters, the Puritan preacher, who attended\r\nthe army in its journeyings.\r\n\r\nThe following curious certificate is given in the preface to a work by\r\nthe Rev. John Heydon, dedicated to Sir Thomas Fairfax, the title page of\r\nwhich reads:—\r\n\r\n  The Discovery of the wonderfull preservation of his Excellencie Sir\r\n  Thomas Fairfax, The Army, the Records of the Town, the Library, and\r\n  blessed Bible, under the hands of the Maior, Aldermen, Capt. and\r\n  Schoolmaster of Torrington in Devon.

The inscriptions on\r\nthese stones run as follows:—\r\n\r\n  This Chvrch was blowen up with Powder Febry ye 16^{th} ano 1645 and\r\n  rebuilt A^d 1651;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n               This Church was re-erected ano Domini 1651.\r\n\r\nUnder the date of February, 1645, there is this entry in the Register of\r\nBurials:—\r\n\r\n  There have bin buried the 16th 17th 18th 19th and 20th 21st dayes 63\r\n  soldyers;\r\n\r\nand other entries appear in July and August of the same year of\r\ninterments of soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn the _Journal of the House of Lords_ (Vol. x., 318) is the following\r\nentry respecting the re-building of the Church:—\r\n\r\n  _10 June 1648_ _Ordered_, By the Lords and Commons assembled in\r\n  Parliament, That a Grant be prepared, and that the Commissioners of\r\n  the Great Seal be hereby authorized and required to pass the same\r\n  under the Great Seal, to the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council, of\r\n  the Town of _Greate Torrington_, in the County of _Devon_, for a\r\n  General Collection of the Charity of well-disposed People, through all\r\n  the Counties of _England_ and Dominion of _Wales_ for Reparation of\r\n  the Great Church of the said Town, which was utterly demolished by the\r\n  Enemies Firing thereof with their Magazine of Powder, to the Value of\r\n  Six Thousand Pounds at least; which the Inhabitants, by reason of the\r\n  Miseries of the late War, and Ruin of the said Town, are no Way able\r\n  to repair.\r\n\r\nThe only external part of the Church which appears to have escaped is\r\nthe vestry, though a few of the piers and arches at the east end seem to\r\nbe in their original condition, and perhaps also the arch of the north\r\ntransept.\r\n\r\n                                                      GEORGE M. DOE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HERRICK AND DEAN PRIOR.\r\n\r\n                         BY F. H. COLSON, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little village of Dean Prior, five miles from Brent on the high road\r\nfrom Plymouth to Ashburton, is indissolubly associated with the name of\r\none of the greatest of our lyric poets; a poet, indeed, who has a\r\ncertain touch and power which is quite unique in English poetry. Robert\r\nHerrick was vicar of this parish for about thirty-two years. The main\r\nfacts of his life may be very shortly told. Born in London in 1591, he\r\nwas educated at St. John’s College and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He spent\r\nthe earlier part of his life, after taking his degree, probably partly\r\nin Cambridge and partly in London. It was not till 1629, when he was\r\nthirty-eight years old, that he was ordained and presented to Dean\r\nPrior. Here he remained till 1648, when he was ejected, and a certain\r\nJohn Syms, a Puritan of some fame and worth, established in his place.\r\nHerrick went to London and there published his two books of verse,\r\n_Hesperides_ and _Noble Numbers_. In 1662 he was sent back to his\r\nliving, and there spent the remainder of his days. He died and was\r\nburied in the churchyard of Dean Prior in 1674.\r\n\r\nThere is not much in this little parish at the present day to remind one\r\nof Herrick. The vicarage is probably an enlargement of the poet’s house.\r\nThe newer part stands on a somewhat higher level than the old, and this\r\nlast is probably the “cell,” whose humble comforts Herrick extols in one\r\nof his most true and charming pieces. The present vicar, Mr.\r\nPerry-Keene, who is himself something of a poet, and knows and loves\r\nwell his great predecessor, showed me what he believes to be Herrick’s\r\n“byn.”\r\n\r\nJust opposite the Vicarage stands the Church, which Mr. Perry-Keene\r\ntells me has been altered a great deal. It now contains a monument to\r\nHerrick erected in 1857 by a remote kinsman, Mr. William Perry Herrick.\r\n\r\nOpposite this recent memorial, in the south aisle, stands a far more\r\ninteresting monument. It is a brass with three figures—husband, wife,\r\nand son—but no name or inscription which might give a clue to the name\r\nis legible. Underneath it, however, run the following verses:—\r\n\r\n           No trust to metals nor to marbles, when\r\n           These have their fate and wear away as men.\r\n           Times, Titles, Trophies may be lost and spent,\r\n           But virtue rears the eternal monument.\r\n\r\n           What more than these can Tombs or Tomb-stones pay?\r\n           But here’s the sunset of a tedious day.\r\n           These two asleep are: I’ll but be undrest,\r\n           And so to Bed, Pray wish us all good rest.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful and interesting epitaph is printed by Mr. Grosart in his\r\nfine edition of Herrick, as being indisputably the work of the poet. Mr.\r\nGrosart also states positively that the figures on the monument are\r\nthose of Sir Edward and Lady Giles, of whom the former died at Dean\r\nCourt in 1637. Mr. Grosart speaks on these points with such certainty\r\nthat I was surprised to find that the external evidence for both\r\nstatements is absolutely nil. As a matter of fact, the monument itself\r\nhardly appears to belong to Herrick’s time. Mr. Perry-Keene’s opinion is\r\n(and I confess that my own very slight knowledge of such subjects would\r\nhave led me to the same conclusion) that the figures are Elizabethan\r\nrather than Caroline. It seems, therefore, hardly safe to print the\r\ninscription as being _undoubtedly_ Herrick’s work. At the same time I do\r\nbelieve that the lines are Herrick’s. There is a very distinct\r\nHerrickian ring about them, particularly about the last three, which to\r\nmy mind is almost unmistakeable. Observe the phrase “I’ll but be\r\nundrest.” It borders on the grotesque; in almost any other poet’s hand\r\nit would have been grotesque. In his hand it acquires a certain\r\nbeautiful quaintness, becomes what Herrick himself calls a “phrase of\r\nthe royal blood.” I commend this charming epitaph, therefore, to the\r\nreader as the one existing memorial which connects Dean Prior with\r\nHerrick, though I think he should at the same time be cautioned, that\r\nthe ascription of the lines to the poet is based solely on internal\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile from the Church stands Dean Court, now a farm-house, in\r\nHerrick’s time a manor house, and occupied during his incumbency by the\r\nabove-mentioned Sir Edward Giles, and afterwards by the Yardes. To-day\r\nit looks what it is, and unless there has been considerable alteration\r\nand demolition, it seems a poor house for such important families.\r\n\r\nA charming village is Dean Prior, as indeed are all the villages on the\r\noutskirts of Dartmoor. No wonder that essayists on, and editors of,\r\nHerrick have traced his freshness and quaintness to the simplicity of a\r\nWest Country parish, and that the perfume of flowers which pervades his\r\npages almost _ad nauseam_ seems to his readers to be inspired by the\r\nsoft and luxurious air of Devonshire. In a word, Herrick’s _Hesperides_\r\nhas seemed to be the work of a Devonshire man drawing his inspiration\r\nfrom Devonshire, as Barnes from Dorset or Burns from Ayrshire.\r\n\r\nI am bound, however, to say that I believe this to be true only with\r\nconsiderable limitations. Generally speaking, I hold that while the\r\n_Noble Numbers_ do undoubtedly belong to the Dean Prior period, the same\r\ncannot be said with equal certainty of the _Hesperides_, or at least of\r\nthat part of the _Hesperides_ which has given Herrick his immortality.\r\nThe book contains, no doubt, several pieces, perhaps some sixty in all,\r\nwhich are shewn by internal evidence to have been written later than\r\n1628, but of these, few, if any, are of special merit. The real Apples\r\nof the Golden Garden are practically undated.\r\n\r\nNow we must remember that not only was Herrick thirty-eight when he went\r\nto Devonshire, an age at which many poets have produced their best work,\r\nbut that he hated, or, to use his own oft-repeated expression, “loathed”\r\nDevonshire. This hatred is expressed in numerous passages. The\r\nfollowing, written at the time of his ejection from the living, may\r\nserve as a specimen:—\r\n\r\n                 First let us dwell in widest seas,\r\n                 Next with severest savages,\r\n                 Last let us make our best abode\r\n                 Where human foot as yet ne’er trod.\r\n                 Search worlds of ice and rather there\r\n                 Live than in loathèd Devonshire.\r\n\r\n“No bird,” says Plato, “sings when it is cold or hungry or suffering any\r\npain,” and it is a natural inference from passages like this of\r\nHerrick’s that his native genius suffered rather than gained from his\r\nsojourn at Dean Prior. But on this point he has left us his own\r\ntestimony in two important passages. The first runs thus:—\r\n\r\n                      Before I went\r\n                      In banishment\r\n                      Into the loathèd West,\r\n                      I could rehearse\r\n                      A lyric verse,\r\n                      And speak it with the best.\r\n\r\nThe second is—\r\n\r\n                  More discontents I never had\r\n                    Since I was born than here,\r\n                  Where I have been and still am sad,\r\n                    In this dull Devonshire.\r\n                  Yet justly too I must confess\r\n                    I ne’er invented such\r\n                  Ennobled numbers for the press\r\n                    As where I loathed so much.\r\n\r\nAt first sight these two passages seem contradictory, but the\r\ncontradiction vanishes when we remember that Herrick’s book of sacred\r\npoems is called _Noble Numbers_. To these and these only, as it seems to\r\nme, the “ennobled numbers” of the second passage refers, and the plain\r\nmeaning of these lines is that Herrick, as vicar of Dean Prior, felt his\r\nold powers of song-making gone, and gave his attention mainly to sacred\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nTo the same conclusion point some lines in the “Farewell to Poetry,”\r\nwritten probably when he took orders:—\r\n\r\n              I my desires screw from thee, and direct\r\n              Them and my thoughts to that sublime respect\r\n              And conscience unto priesthood.\r\n\r\nBut he adds:—\r\n\r\n               When my diviner muse\r\n               Shall want a handmaid as she oft will use,\r\n               Be ready then for me to wait upon her,\r\n               Though as a servant, yet a maid of honour.\r\n\r\nI do not of course suggest that all this is to be taken quite literally,\r\nor that we are to affirm positively that all Herrick’s best lyrics date\r\nfrom an earlier period; but that it is generally true I see no reason to\r\ndoubt, more especially as in the many hundred lyrics which\r\n\r\n            Sing of brooks, of blossoms, birds and flowers,\r\n            Of April, May and June, and July flowers,\r\n\r\nthere is, so far as I can see, little or no trace of Devonshire.\r\n\r\nThe great poets—whom Herrick looked on as his masters—Catullus and\r\nHorace, understood the magic of a name, and were fond of grouping their\r\nbest thoughts round the names of the particular spots which they knew.\r\nAnyone who reads Catullus’s lines on Sirmio, or Horace’s on Tivoli,\r\nanyone, we may add, who knows Burns, or Wordsworth, or Scott, will feel\r\nthe significance of the fact that Herrick only once mentions by name any\r\nplace in Devonshire. It is not that he dislikes localising, for he\r\nlingers affectionately enough over the names of\r\n\r\n               Richmond, Kingston, and of Hampton Court.\r\n\r\nAnd on the one occasion, when a Devonshire scene is described by name,\r\nit is in the following lines on “Dean, a rude river in Devon, by which\r\nhe sometimes dwelt”:—\r\n\r\n               Dean Bourn, farewell! I never look to see\r\n               Dean, or thy watry incivility.\r\n\r\nThe reader of Herrick will remember that he goes on to say that the\r\n“currish, churlish” people of Dean are as rocky as their river. Herrick\r\ncould hardly be expected to admire Dartmoor itself. The love of moor and\r\nmountain hardly existed in his time; but the glen of Dean Bourne is a\r\ndifferent thing, and surely nothing but invincible prejudice can have\r\nmade Herrick describe it in such “currish and churlish” terms.\r\n\r\nHerrick is _par excellence_ the poet of flowers and fruits. Cherries,\r\ncowslips, daffodils, and primroses are inseparably connected with his\r\nverse. That the rich luxuriance of Dean Prior must have been a source of\r\ncontinual pleasure to him we cannot doubt. Yet even in this department\r\nof nature one misses local touches. Where are the high hedgerows, the\r\nferns, and the fox-gloves? and where are the apple orchards of Devon?\r\n\r\nHerrick was very fond of observing village festivities and studying\r\nfolk-lore, and it is generally assumed that the poems which deal with\r\nthese subjects were written in Devonshire and based on Devonshire\r\nobservations. This may be so, though I do not know of any evidence in\r\nfavour of it. On the other hand there is one small circumstance which\r\nseems to me significant. In Herrick’s descriptions of barley-breaks,\r\nharvest homes, and Christmas festivities, there is much mention of beer\r\nbut none of cider. Cider making had its poetry for Keats:—\r\n\r\n              Or by a cider-press with patient look\r\n              Thou watchest the last oozings hour by hour.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that it should never be mentioned by the poet of\r\ncider-land.\r\n\r\nOne of Herrick’s parishioners stands out pleasantly in the pages of\r\n_Hesperides_—“my Prue,” otherwise Prudence Baldwin, the house-keeper,\r\nwho apparently followed him to London at his ejection and returned with\r\nhim in 1662. It is generally assumed that the persons attacked in the\r\nepigrams were parishioners. If so, no wonder they were churlish. It does\r\nnot appear that many of the fifty or sixty persons addressed in what Mr.\r\nGrosart calls “verse-celebrations,” were West-Country people, and on the\r\nwhole there is as little of local life as of local scenery in the\r\n_Hesperides_.\r\n\r\nThe critics, then, seem to me perverse, who, in spite of Herrick’s\r\nassurances, declare that he only pretended to dislike Dean Prior. They\r\nrely, presumably, on his keen eye for country beauties. Now I venture to\r\ndoubt whether Herrick, as we see him in the _Hesperides_, is one of the\r\nreal nature-poets. He knows and loves certain aspects of nature, more\r\nparticularly fruits and flowers, bright colours and sweet smells. Even\r\namongst these he is often happiest when he can trace some likeness to\r\nhuman beauty. The famous “Cherries ripe” grew on Julia’s lips, not in an\r\norchard. Above all poets he understands the picturesqueness of dress,\r\nand when after a catalogue of Julia’s silks and laces in their “wild\r\ncivility” he confesses that he dotes less on nature than on art, he\r\nprobably speaks the truth. It is the same with country life; he has none\r\nof the deep respect for the peasant’s healthy and thrifty life, which\r\nlies at the bottom of Virgil and Horace and Wordsworth’s work. He has\r\nplenty of interest in their May-days and other merry-making, but little,\r\nI think, in their life as a whole. And the few praises of country life\r\nto be found in the _Hesperides_ do not seem to me to ring very true.\r\n\r\nIf, then, I read Herrick’s life at Dean Prior aright, he is not the\r\ngenial parson, moving light-heartedly among the people, drinking in the\r\nsoft air of Devonshire and pouring it out in spontaneous song, passing\r\nfrom his sermon to the Maypole, blending Paganism with Christianity and\r\nribaldry with religion, without sense of harm or incongruity—writing, in\r\nfact, the _Hesperides_ on weekdays and the _Noble Numbers_ on Sundays.\r\nRather it was by the Cam and the Thames that he imbibed his inspiration,\r\nmade love to his half-imaginary mistresses, and learnt—\r\n\r\n               How roses first grew red and lilies white.\r\n\r\nIn Devonshire he is a changed man, sobered partly by isolation and\r\npartly by clerical responsibility. He has, no doubt, his light-hearted\r\nand even wanton moods, and often writes poetry in the old vein; but he\r\nfeels that the old lyrical effusiveness is going or gone, and finds his\r\nmain occupation in writing sacred poetry.\r\n\r\nAt any rate he did not write gross or indecent verse during this period.\r\nThis all too plentiful element of the _Hesperides_ need not be fathered\r\non Dean Prior. He himself calls it—\r\n\r\n                                 Unbaptised rhymes\r\n                   Writ in my wild, unhallowed times.\r\n\r\nThere is surely no reason why these words should not be taken in their\r\nliteral sense, which is that they were written in Herrick’s youth and\r\nbefore he took orders, and the pilgrim to Dean Prior need not harrow his\r\nimagination with the revolting picture of this elderly bachelor sitting\r\nin the little vicarage spinning out these miserable and often pointless\r\nindecencies. No doubt it may be asked why, if these were poems of\r\nHerrick’s youth, condemned by his better judgment, he published them in\r\n1648. Two answers may be given to this question, though I do not say\r\nthat either of them is an excuse. In the first place he had been turned\r\nout of his living and probably wanted money. In the second place, the\r\nfact that he describes himself on the title page as Robert Herrick,\r\nEsq., seems to indicate that he considered his clerical profession had\r\ngone with his incumbency, and if so, he very probably had deluded\r\nhimself into the idea that clerical responsibility had gone also.\r\n\r\nI will devote the rest of my allotted space to a few remarks on that\r\npart of Herrick’s work which undoubtedly belongs to the Dean Prior\r\nperiod. I mean the “pious pieces,” or _Noble Numbers_. Now it is not to\r\nbe denied that there is a great deal of poor stuff in the _Noble\r\nNumbers_. Nobody is likely to care much for the metrical creeds, or the\r\ntawdry and sensuous poems on the Nativity or Passion. Still the little\r\nbook contains some pieces which English literature could ill spare.\r\nThere is, for instance, the strange and, indeed, startling “litany to\r\nthe Holy Spirit.” This hymn is actually included in one at least of our\r\npopular hymn-books, and I have sometimes heard parts of it sung in a\r\nvillage church. I wonder what the congregation would have thought of\r\nthese two stanzas, which, needless to say, are not to be found in the\r\nhymn-book version:—\r\n\r\n                    When the artless doctor sees\r\n                    No one hope, but in his fees\r\n                    And his skill runs on the lees,\r\n                        Sweet Spirit, comfort me.\r\n\r\n                    When his Potion and his Pill\r\n                    Has or none or little skill,\r\n                    Meet for nothing but to kill,\r\n                        Sweet Spirit, comfort me.\r\n\r\nProbably they would be greatly shocked, and indeed everyone must admit\r\nthat the stanzas show a certain strange devilry mixing itself with\r\nHerrick’s most reverent thoughts. At the same time, I do not think there\r\nis any real or intentional irreverence in them. There is one stanza in\r\nthe “Litany” which has, I think, a personal interest:—\r\n\r\n                   When the house doth sigh and weep,\r\n                   And the world is drowned in sleep,\r\n                   Yet mine eyes the watch do keep,\r\n                       Sweet Spirit, comfort me.\r\n\r\nNow compare this with the following:—\r\n\r\n             Night hath no wings to him that cannot sleep,\r\n             And time seems then not for to flie but creep.\r\n                   .      .      .      .      .      .\r\n             Just so it is with me who listening pray\r\n             The winds to blow the tedious night away.\r\n\r\nAnd again—\r\n\r\n                  Through all the night\r\n                  Thou dost me fright,\r\n                  And holdst mine eyes from sleeping.\r\n\r\nI infer from these that Herrick suffered much from sleeplessness, and if\r\nso, may we not with considerable probability trace the genesis of this\r\ncelebrated litany to some sleepless nights in the little vicarage of\r\nDean Prior?\r\n\r\nAgain it is to the _Noble Numbers_ that we owe the beautiful “Lord, Thou\r\nhast given me a cell.” Familiar as this poem is, it is only a just\r\ntribute to Dean Prior that these sweet praises of its simple plenty\r\nshould be set down here.\r\n\r\n                  A THANKSGIVING TO GOD FOR HIS HOUSE.\r\n\r\n              Lord, Thou hast given me a cell\r\n                    Wherein to dwell;\r\n              A little house, whose humble roof\r\n                    Is weather-proof;\r\n              Under the sparres of which I lie\r\n                    Both soft and drie;\r\n              Where Thou my chamber for to ward\r\n                    Has set a guard\r\n              Of harmless thoughts, to watch and keep\r\n                    Me while I sleep.\r\n              Low is my porch, as is my Fate,\r\n                    Both void of state;\r\n              And yet the threshold of my doore\r\n                    Is worn by th’ poore,\r\n              Who thither come, and freely get\r\n                    Good words or meat.\r\n              Like as my Parlour, so my hall\r\n                    And Kitchen’s small:\r\n              A little Buttery, and therein\r\n                    A little Byn\r\n              Which keeps my little Loafe of Bread\r\n                    Unchipt, unflead:\r\n              Some little sticks of Thorne or Briar\r\n                    Making a fire,\r\n              Close by whose living fire I sit\r\n                    And glow like it.\r\n              Lord, I confess too, when I dine,\r\n                    The Pulse is Thine,\r\n              And all those other bits, that bee\r\n                    There plac’d by Thee;\r\n              The Worts, the Purslaine, and the Messe\r\n                    Of Water-cresse,\r\n              Which of Thy kindness Thou hast sent;\r\n                    And my content\r\n              Makes those, and my beloved Beet\r\n                    To be more sweet.\r\n              ’Tis thou that crownst my glittering Hearth\r\n                    With guiltlesse mirth;\r\n              And giv’st me Wassaile Bowles to drink,\r\n                    Spic’d to the brink.\r\n              Lord,’tis Thy plenty-dropping Hand\r\n                    That soiles my land;\r\n              And giv’st me, for my Bushell sowne,\r\n                    Twice ten for one:\r\n              Thou mak’st my teaming Hen to lay\r\n                    Her egg each day:\r\n              Besides my healthful Ewes to beare\r\n                    Me twins each year.\r\n              The while the conduits of my kine\r\n                    Run creame (for Wine).\r\n              All these, and better Thou doest send\r\n                    Me, to this end,\r\n              That I should render, for my part,\r\n                    A thankful heart,\r\n              Which, fired with incense, I resigne,\r\n                    As wholly Thine;\r\n              But the acceptance, that must be,\r\n                    My Christ to Thee.\r\n\r\nAnd now let me ask the reader to note the following triplet, which\r\noccurs in a Christmas Anthem in _Noble Numbers_:—\r\n\r\n                We see Him come and know Him ours,\r\n                Who with His sunshine and His showers\r\n                Turns all the patient earth to flowers.\r\n\r\nI think if we compare these two poems, which embody Herrick’s attitude\r\nto nature and country life during the Dean Prior period, with some of\r\nthe earlier (as I think) lyrics in the _Hesperides_, we shall feel that\r\nif Dean Prior took something from him, it also gave him something.\r\nCompare them, for instance, with “Fair Daffodils, we weep to see,” or\r\nthe song to “Meddows,” which begins “Ye have been fresh and green.”\r\nThese last are beautiful fancies, among the most beautiful in our\r\nlanguage, but they have not the depth or fulness of feeling which the\r\ntriplet has. _That_ breathes the spirit of the true lover of rural life,\r\nand so it seems to me that if Herrick, in this little out-of-the-way\r\nvillage, felt the lyric power gone, if the “fairy fancies” no longer\r\n“ranged” or “lightly stirred” as before, on the other hand, something of\r\nthe peace of a country village, something of the peace which Wordsworth\r\nfelt two centuries later, had descended upon him.\r\n\r\nFinally, let me call the reader’s attention to the two “Graces for\r\nlittle children,” also to be found in _Noble Numbers_:—\r\n\r\n                    Here a little child I stand,\r\n                    Heaving up my either hand;\r\n                    Cold as paddocks though they be,\r\n                    Here I lift them up to Thee\r\n                    For a Benison to fall\r\n                    On our meat and on us all.\r\n\r\nAnd again—\r\n\r\n                  What God gives and what we take,\r\n                  ’Tis a gift for Christ His sake;\r\n                  Be the meal of beans and pease,\r\n                  God be thanked for those and these.\r\n                  Have we flesh or have we fish,\r\n                  All are fragments from His dish.\r\n                  He His Church save and the King,\r\n                  And our peace here like a spring\r\n                  Send it ever flourishing.\r\n\r\nIf I may indulge in a little fancy, I should say that this last was\r\nwritten for some small Dean Prior “maid”; written on one of those\r\ndelicious balmy days which a Devonshire spring sometimes, though not,\r\nalas! always, brings; written during the first half of Herrick’s first\r\nincumbency, when peace still “flourished” at Dean Prior, though perhaps\r\nthe shadows of the coming trouble were not unfelt by those who could\r\nread the signs of the times. Both these “Graces” always seem to me to\r\nhave a peculiar charm and freshness, and even by themselves they would\r\ngo far to justify the view that has been maintained in this essay, that\r\nHerrick’s genius, if hampered and enfeebled in some ways, was in other\r\nways matured and mellowed by his sojourn in “dull Devonshire.”\r\n\r\nThe following passage, which is an extract from an article in the\r\n_Quarterly_ of August, 1809, by Mr. Barron Field, may be of some\r\ninterest:—\r\n\r\n  Being in Devonshire during the last summer, we took an opportunity of\r\n  visiting Dean Prior for the purpose of making some inquiries\r\n  concerning Herrick, who, from the circumstance of having been vicar of\r\n  that parish (where he is still talked of as a poet, a wit, and a hater\r\n  of the county) for twenty years, might be supposed to have left some\r\n  unrecorded memorials of his existence behind him. We found many\r\n  persons in the village who could repeat some of his lines, and none\r\n  who were not acquainted with his \"Farewell to Dean Bourn\"—\r\n\r\n                “Dean Bourn, farewell; I never look to see\r\n                Dean, or thy watry incivility,”\r\n\r\n  which, they said, he uttered as he crossed the brook upon being\r\n  ejected by Cromwell from the Vicarage, to which he had been presented\r\n  by Charles I. “But,” they added, with an air of innocent triumph, “he\r\n  did see it again,” as was the fact after the Restoration. And, indeed,\r\n  although he calls Devonshire “dull,” yet as he admits, at the same\r\n  time, that “he never invented such ennobled numbers for the press as\r\n  in that loathed spot,” the good people of Dean Prior have not much\r\n  reason to be dissatisfied.\r\n\r\n  The person, however, who knows more of Herrick than all the rest of\r\n  the neighbourhood, we found to be a poor woman in the ninety-ninth\r\n  year of her age, named Dorothy King. She repeated to us, with great\r\n  exactness, five of his _Noble Numbers_, among which was the beautiful\r\n  Litany quoted above. These she had learned from her mother, who was\r\n  apprenticed to Herrick’s successor in the vicarage. She called them\r\n  her prayers, which, she said, she was in the habit of putting up in\r\n  bed whenever she could not sleep, and she therefore began the Litany\r\n  at the second stanza, “When I lie within my bed,” etc. Another of her\r\n  midnight orisons was the poem beginning—\r\n\r\n                 “Every night thou does me fright,\r\n                 And keep mine eyes from sleeping,” etc.\r\n\r\n  She had no idea that these poems had ever been printed, and could not\r\n  have read them if she had seen them. She is in possession of few\r\n  traditions as to the person, manners, and habits of life of the poet,\r\n  but in return she has a whole budget of anecdotes respecting his\r\n  ghost, and these she details with a careless but serene gravity which\r\n  one would not willingly discompose by any hints at a remote\r\n  possibility of their not being exactly true. Herrick, she says, was a\r\n  bachelor, and kept a maid-servant, as his poems, indeed, discover; but\r\n  she adds, what they do not discover, that he also kept a pet pig,\r\n  which he taught to drink out of a tankard. And this important\r\n  circumstance, together with a tradition that he one day threw his\r\n  sermon at the congregation, with a curse for their inattention, forms\r\n  almost the sum total of what we could collect of the poet’s life.\r\n\r\n                                                       F.

AT TORBAY.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE LANDING OF THE PRINCE OF\r\n                        ORANGE AT BRIXHAM, 1688.\r\n\r\n                      BY THE LATE T. W. WINDEATT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe landing of the Prince of Orange—the Prince who \"saved England\"—on\r\nthe shores of Devon in 1688, must always be a matter of interest. The\r\nsubject has been dealt with by Macaulay and other historians with more\r\nor less detail. I certainly should not, therefore, have ventured on the\r\nsubject myself had it not been for the fact of having had placed in my\r\nhands, through the courtesy of Mr. J. B. Davidson, of Secktor, a\r\nsomewhat rare pamphlet, containing many interesting facts not noted in\r\nthe papers referred to by Mr. Pengelly, and from my being the repository\r\nof some local anecdotes worth preserving.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet I have referred to is entitled, “An Exact Diary of the late\r\nExpedition of His Illustrious Highness The Prince of Orange (now King of\r\nGreat Britain), from his Palace at the Hague to his Landing at Torbay,\r\nand from thence to his arrival at Whitehall. Giving a particular account\r\nof all that happened and every Day’s March. By a Minister Chaplain in\r\nthe Army.” It consists of seventy-three pages, was printed for Richard\r\nBaldwin, near the Black Bull, in the Old Bailey, in 1689, licensed April\r\n23rd, 1689. It is dedicated to the Earls of Bedford and Portland,\r\nViscount Sidney of Sheppy, and Sir John Maynard, one of the Lords\r\nCommissioners of the Great Seal; and from the Dedication it appears that\r\nthe writer was one “John Whittle.”\r\n\r\nThis Sir John Maynard was at this time Recorder for this borough, and\r\nmember for the borough during the Long Parliament. He was a very able\r\nlawyer, and at this time near ninety. It is related of him that when he\r\ncame “with the men of the law” to welcome the Prince, the latter took\r\nnotice of his great age, and said that he had outlived all the men of\r\nthe law of his time. Whereupon Maynard replied, he had like to have\r\noutlived the law itself if his Highness had not come over.\r\n\r\nThat this pamphlet is genuine, and was written by an English clergyman\r\nwho accompanied the expedition throughout, there is strong internal\r\nevidence; and Macaulay cites it as one of the authorities for several of\r\nhis statements with reference to the expedition, though he does not\r\nquote largely from it.\r\n\r\nIn this diary or, more strictly, narrative, which enters more fully into\r\nparticulars than the other pamphlets, Mr. Whittle gives a graphic\r\naccount of the arrangements for, and the departure of, the expedition,\r\nthe storm which sent it back again, its refitting, second departure, and\r\nsafe (if not miraculous) arrival in Torbay, of all of which the writer\r\nwas evidently an eye-witness.\r\n\r\n  The number of our capital ships or men-of-war was about fifty, which\r\n  were very well rig’d, mann’d, and provided with all things requisite;\r\n  the number of our fire-ships was about five and twenty; lesser\r\n  Men-of-war or Frigats about six and twenty; the number of Merchant\r\n  Ships, Pinks, Fly-boats and others was about three hundred and odd; so\r\n  the total number of the Fleet as they sailed from the Brill was about\r\n  four hundred and odd ships. But at our setting out the second time, at\r\n  Hellevort-Sluys, there were near an hundred vessels more, which were\r\n  Schievelingers or Boats which the Fisher-men of Schieveling went to\r\n  sea in.\r\n\r\nWhittle gives the following account of the final departure of the\r\nexpedition:—\r\n\r\n  Upon Thursday, Novemb. 1, Old Stile, Novemb. 11, New Stile, after the\r\n  Prince of Orange had din’^d with all English, Dutch, Scotch, and\r\n  French Lords, Knights and Gentlemen attending his Sacred Person, about\r\n  three or four of clock in the afternoon, he went on board a new vessel\r\n  of about Twenty-eight Guns, with the Rotterdam’s Admiral call’d the\r\n  Brill, as some will have it, and being now in his Cabin, fired, for to\r\n  give notice unto all the Fleet to weigh their anchors and make Sail,\r\n  which was accordingly done by every Ship with all possible expedition.\r\n  The whole Fleet was divided into three Squadrons; the Red Flag was for\r\n  the English and Scotch, commanded by Major-General Mackay; the White\r\n  Flag was for the Prince’s Guards and the Brandenburghers, commanded by\r\n  Count Solms; the Blew Flag was for the Dutch and French, commanded by\r\n  Count Nassau. Now every Ship had a certain Mark, or Token, that it\r\n  might be known unto what Squadron she belong^d.\r\n\r\n  So once more the whole Fleet (thro’ God’s blessing) was under sail for\r\n  England, with a very favourable East Wind. The darkness coming on us,\r\n  all the Ships set out their Lights, which was very pleasant to see,\r\n  and the Ship in which the Prince of Orange was, had three Lanthorns,\r\n  the Men of War two, and each other Ship one.\r\n\r\nWhittle brings the fleet to the English shores, and thus continues:—\r\n\r\n  On the morrow-morning, being the Lord’s day, Novemb. 4, Old Stile,\r\n  which was the happy Birthday of his thrice Illustrious Highness, the\r\n  Prince of Orange; most men were of opinion that we should land either\r\n  in the Isle of Wight, Portsmouth, or some other convenient place,\r\n  about which matter they were much mistaken, for the Prince of Orange\r\n  did not sail, but observe the duty of the day; so all were driven of\r\n  the Waves. Prayers and Sermon being done, he went to Dinner with some\r\n  Nobles attending him, and about Four of Clock in the afternoon made\r\n  sail, all the whole Fleet following the example of his ship; now every\r\n  Schipper endeavour’d for to keep sight of the three Lanthorns or\r\n  Admiral of Rotterdam’s Ship for the sake of his Highness therein. The\r\n  darkness shutting upon us all our Lights were set out as before.\r\n\r\nWhittle then brings us down to the morning of Monday, the 5th of\r\nNovember, and proceeds as follows:—\r\n\r\n  So when the day began to dawn, we found that we were very near the\r\n  English Shore, but whereabout we could not yet tell. The Ship in which\r\n  the Prince of Orange was sailed so near the Shore that with much\r\n  facility a man might cast a stone on the Land; we were driven very\r\n  slowly, all our Sails being struck. The morning was very obscure with\r\n  the Fog and Mist, and withal it was so calm that the Vessels now as\r\n  ’twere touch’d each other, every Ship coming as near unto the Ship\r\n  wherein the Prince of Orange was as the Schipper thereof would permit\r\n  them. Here we were moving for a while very slowly by the Shore, and\r\n  could see all the Rocks there abouts very plain. We perceived that we\r\n  should land thereabout, but no place near was commodious for either\r\n  Men or Horses, it being a steep Rock to march up. The Ships did all\r\n  observe the motion of the three Lanthorns, which were driven by the\r\n  Coast of England back again, for we had sailed somewhat beyond Torbay.\r\n  And being thus calm’d for a while, it afterwards pleased the God of\r\n  Heaven, that He gave us a West or Westerly Wind, which was the only\r\n  Wind that could blow to bring us safe into the Bay; for even to this\r\n  place we had an East and South-East Wind, which was indeed a good Wind\r\n  to bring us from Holland, and along all the Channel, but not to carry\r\n  us into the Bay, there were so many Rocks and Shelves on that side.\r\n  Making some Sail again, his Highness the Prince of Orange gave order\r\n  that his Standard should be put up, and accordingly it was done, the\r\n  White Flag being put uppermost, signifying his most gracious offer of\r\n  Peace unto all such as would live peaceably: And under that the Red or\r\n  Bloody Flag was set up, signifying War unto all such as did oppose his\r\n  just Designs. The Sun recovering strength soon dissipated the Fog, and\r\n  dispers’d the Mist, insomuch that it prov’d a very pleasant Day. Now\r\n  every Vessel set out its Colours, which made a very pleasant show. By\r\n  this time the People of Devonshire thereabout had discovered the\r\n  Fleet, the one telling the other thereof; they came flocking in droves\r\n  to the side or brow of the Hills to view us: Some guess’d we were\r\n  French, because they saw divers White Flags; but the Standard of the\r\n  Prince, the Motto of which was, For the Protestant Religion and\r\n  Liberty, soon undeceived them.\r\n\r\n  Others more discreet said, that it was the Dutch Fleet so much talk’d\r\n  of in the Nation, and so long expected by most people. This Day was\r\n  very remarkable in England before, being the fifth of November, the\r\n  Bells were ringing as we were sailing towards the Bay, and as we\r\n  landed, which many judged to be a good Omen: before we came into the\r\n  Bay’s mouth, as we were near the Rocks, the People ran from Place to\r\n  Place after us; and we being so near as to see and discern the Habit\r\n  of the Country People, and they able to see us and hear our voices, a\r\n  certain Minister in the Fleet, on board the Ship called the Golden\r\n  Sun, went up to the top of the uppermost Cabin, where the Colours hang\r\n  out, a Place where he could easily behold all the people on the Shore,\r\n  and where they might most perfectly see him, and pulling a Bible out\r\n  of his Pocket, he opened it, and held it so in his right Hand, making\r\n  many flourishes with it unto the People, whose Eyes were fix’^d on\r\n  him, and duly observ’d him, thereby signifying to the People the\r\n  flourishing of the Holy Gospel (by God’s Blessing upon the Prince of\r\n  Orange’s Endeavours), and calling out as loud as he was able, said\r\n  unto them on the top of the Rock: For the Protestant Religion, and\r\n  maintaining of the Gospel in the Truth and Purity thereof, are we all\r\n  by the Goodness and Providence of God come hither, after so many\r\n  storms and Tempests. Moreover, said he, it is the Prince of Orange\r\n  that’s come, a Zealous Defender of that Faith which is truly Ancient,\r\n  Catholic, and Apostolical, who is the Supream Governour of this very\r\n  great and fomidable Fleet. Whereupon all the People shouted for Joy,\r\n  and Huzzas did now echo into the Air, many amongst them throwing up\r\n  their Hats, and all making signs with their Hands. So after the\r\n  Minister had given them some Salutations, and they returned him the\r\n  same again, he came down from off the upper Deck, unto the vulgar one\r\n  among his Acquaintance, who spoke to him about the People on the brow\r\n  or side of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe bells were evidently ringing for the 5th of November, and I find\r\nthat the bells of the parish church of Brixham are still rung on that\r\nday, but I apprehend that the custom has been continued in commemoration\r\nof the landing of the Prince.\r\n\r\nAll who know Brixham, even in its present populous condition, can\r\ncorroborate the accuracy of Whittle’s description of the coast, and\r\nrecognize his felicitous expression of the people on shore being “on the\r\nbrow of the mountain.”\r\n\r\nWhittle proceeds as follows:—\r\n\r\n  The Prince of Orange being come into the middle of the Bay, called\r\n  Torbay, attended with three or four Men of War only, that is to say,\r\n  one or two sailing before his Vessel, and one on each side the Ship in\r\n  which he was; and all the Merchant Ships, Pinks and Fly-boats coming\r\n  round him, as near as they durst for safety, the rest of the Men of\r\n  War being out in the Rear to secure all the little Pinks and\r\n  Fly-boats, and withal to prevent the English Fleet from disturbing us\r\n  in our Landing.\r\n\r\n  At the upper end of Torbay there is a fair House, belonging to one Mr.\r\n  Carey, a very rigid Papist, who entertained a Priest in his House.\r\n  This Priest going to recreate himself on the Leads, on the top\r\n  thereof, it being a most delightsome day, as he was walking there he\r\n  happened to cast his Eyes towards the Sea, and espying the Fleet at a\r\n  distance, withal being purblind in his Eyes, as well as blinded by\r\n  Satan in his mind, he presently concludes that ’twas the French Navy\r\n  (because he saw divers White Flags) come to land the Sons of Belial,\r\n  which should cut off the Children of God, or as they call us, the\r\n  Hereticks. And being transported with joy, he hastened to inform his\r\n  own Disciples of the House, and forthwith they sung Te Deum. This was\r\n  a second grand Mistake, the third time will fall to our Lot to sing Te\r\n  Deum for our safe Landing (as the Prince had it done at Exeter\r\n  Cathedral in the Quire): And because false Reports were spread abroad,\r\n  that the People of this House had shot several of the Prince of\r\n  Orange’s Souldiers, and thereupon they had burnt down the House. I\r\n  must inform the candid Reader that there was nothing at all in it, for\r\n  our People did not give them one reviling word, nor they us; some\r\n  lodged there while we were at Torbay.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds with the following account of the landing:—\r\n\r\n  The major part of the fleet being come into the Bay, Boats were\r\n  ordered to carry the Prince on Shore, with his Guards; and passing\r\n  towards the Land, with sundry Lords, the Admiral of Rotterdam gave\r\n  divers Guns at his Landing; the Boat was held length-ways until he was\r\n  on shore: So after he had set his Fleet on Land, then came all the\r\n  Lords and Guards, some going before his Sacred Person, and some coming\r\n  after. There are sundry little Houses which belong unto Fishermen,\r\n  between the two Hills, at Torbay where we landed. The People of these\r\n  Houses came running out at their Doors to see this happy Sight. So the\r\n  Prince, with Mareschal Schomberg, and divers Lords, Knights, and\r\n  Gentlemen, marched up the Hill, which all the Fleet could see over the\r\n  Houses, the Colours flying and flourishing before his Highness, the\r\n  Trumpets sounding, the Hoit-boys played, the Drums beat, and the\r\n  Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, and Guards shouted; and sundry Huzzas did\r\n  now echo in the Fleet, from off the Hill, insomuch that our very\r\n  hearts below in the water were even ravished for joy thereof. On this\r\n  Hill you could see all the Fleet most perfectly, and the Men of War\r\n  sailing up and down the Seas, to clear them of all enemies; the Ships\r\n  in the Rear making all the sail and speed they could.\r\n\r\n  The Navy was like a little City, the masts appearing like so many\r\n  Spires. The People were like Bees swarming all over the Bay; and now\r\n  all the Schievelingers are set to work to carry the Men and Horses\r\n  unto Shore with speed, for as yet they had done nothing. The Officers\r\n  and Souldiers crowded the Boats extreamly, many being ready to sink\r\n  under the Weight; happy was that Man which would get to Land soonest:\r\n  And such was the eagerness of both Officers and Souldiers, that divers\r\n  jeoparded their Lives for haste. Sundry Oars were broken in rowing,\r\n  because too many laid hands on them, some jump’d up to their Knees in\r\n  Water, and one or two were over Head and Ears. Extraordinary pains was\r\n  now taken by all sorts of Men to get their necessary things to shore,\r\n  every one minding his own concern. The Night was now as the Day for\r\n  Labour, and all this was done, lest the Enemy should come before we\r\n  were all in readiness to receive them. The Country Harmony was,\r\n  ringing of Bells for our arrival.\r\n\r\n  The Officers and Souldiers were continually marching up the Hill after\r\n  the manner of the Guards, with their Colours flying and flourishing,\r\n  Hoit-boyes playing, Drums beating, and all shouting and echoing forth\r\n  Huzzas.\r\n\r\nWhittle does not give many particulars of the landing of the Prince\r\nhimself. Probably they did not land at the same time. It is interesting\r\nas to this to refer to the details given by Blewitt in the _Panorama_.\r\nHis account is as follows:—\r\n\r\n  The 4th of November it anchored safely in Torbay. This was the\r\n  anniversary of the Prince’s birth and marriage, and he therefore\r\n  wished to render it more memorable by landing on the British shore.\r\n  The preparations, however, could not be completed that night, but on\r\n  the following day, the Prince, attended by his principal officers,\r\n  proceeded to raise his standard on Brixham Quay. At this time Brixham\r\n  contained but few houses, and the good people, astonished at the\r\n  appearance of such an armament, are said to have stood in silent\r\n  wonder on the beach. At last William approached the shore and demanded\r\n  whether he was welcome, when after some further pause he was asked his\r\n  business, and his explanation considered satisfactory, he was, after a\r\n  little more parley, informed that he was welcome. “If I am, then,”\r\n  said the Prince, “come and carry me ashore,” and immediately a little\r\n  man, one of the party, plunged into the water and carried him\r\n  triumphantly ashore to the steps of the pier. On his landing the\r\n  inhabitants are said to have presented their illustrious visitor with\r\n  the following address:\r\n\r\n                  “And please your Majesty King William,\r\n                  You’re welcome to Brixham Quay\r\n                  To eat buckhorn and drink bohea,\r\n                  Along with me,\r\n                  And please your Majesty King William.”\r\n\r\nThis story Mr. White very properly calls an absurd one, as the Prince\r\nwas not a King, and tea was a fabulous price.\r\n\r\nIn a note to this account, said to have been communicated by the Rev. H.\r\nF. Lyte, it is stated as follows:—\r\n\r\n  The subsequent history of the “little man” who carried the King on\r\n  shore is rather singular. Having a short ambling pony, which was\r\n  commonly used in fish-jolting, he rode bare-headed before the Prince\r\n  to Newton and afterwards to Exeter, and so pleased him by his zeal\r\n  that he told him to come to him to court, where he should be seated on\r\n  the throne, and he would make a great man of him. He also gave him a\r\n  line under his hand, which was to be his passport into the royal\r\n  presence. In due time accordingly the little man took his course to\r\n  London, promising his townsmen that he should come back among them a\r\n  Lord at least. When, however, he arrived there some sharpers, who\r\n  learnt his errand at the inn where he put up, made our poor little\r\n  Brixhamite gloriously drunk, and kept him in that state for several\r\n  successive weeks. During this time one of the party, having obtained\r\n  the passport, went to court with the little man’s tale in his mouth,\r\n  and received a handsome present from the King. Our adventurer,\r\n  recovering himself shortly afterwards, went to the Palace without his\r\n  card of admission and was repulsed as an impostor, and came back to\r\n  Brixham never to hold up his head again.\r\n\r\nI find that this story of the little fisherman carrying the Prince on\r\nshore is still current at Brixham, the reason given for it being that it\r\nwas low tide at the time; the ending of the story as given to me being\r\nthat the “little man” who journeyed to London to see the Prince, owing\r\nto being in difficulties from having lost his horse, and his boat being\r\nout of repair, did see the King, and received a large sum of money, said\r\nto be £100, with which he built a house in Brixham and lived “happily\r\nfor ever after.” His name was Varwell, and one story is that the Prince,\r\non being carried safely on shore, desired him to ask a favour of him,\r\nupon which the fisherman desired that no press-gang might be sent to\r\nBrixham. The actual spot on which the Prince landed was where the fish\r\nmarket now stands, and the stone on which the Prince first placed his\r\nfoot was long preserved there and pointed out with pride and veneration.\r\nIn 1828 William IV., then Duke of Clarence, having come into Torbay,\r\nlanded at the New Quay at Brixham, and this stone was removed from the\r\nfish market to this place to have the additional honour of receiving the\r\nsecond Prince of that name who had dignified Brixham by his presence;\r\nand while the Duke stood on the stone the Rev. H. F. Lyte, on the part\r\nof the inhabitants, presented him with a box of heart of oak eight\r\nhundred years old, a portion of the timber of the old Totnes bridge,\r\nlined with velvet, containing a small portion of the stone, which the\r\nDuke in his reply promised to preserve as a precious relic.\r\n\r\nThe stone itself was built into a small granite column erected to\r\ncommemorate the landing of the two Princes, and was set up in the fish\r\nmarket; but in consequence of its inconvenient situation it was taken\r\ndown and subsequently erected on the Victoria Pier.\r\n\r\nBlewitt remarks that the landing of the Prince on the shoulders of the\r\nlittle fisherman was a very different kind of landing to that which\r\nNorthcote has assigned to William in his celebrated picture. An old\r\nDutch print, at present in my possession, purporting to be a delineation\r\nof the landing, represents on the land a large and imposing castle, into\r\nwhich the troops as they land are triumphantly marching, the Prince’s\r\nflag flying from the summit.\r\n\r\nTo return to Whittle’s narrative, we find him giving the following\r\naccount of the proceedings subsequent to the landing:—\r\n\r\n  As soon as the Prince had viewed well the Ground upon the top of the\r\n  Hill, and found the most commodious place for all his Army to encamp,\r\n  he then gave Orders for everything, and so returned down the Hill unto\r\n  the Fishermen’s little Houses: One of which he made his Palace at that\r\n  time, instead of those at Loo, Honsterdyke, and the Hague. The Horse\r\n  Guards and some Foot were round about him at other Houses, and a\r\n  strong Guard but a little below the House wherein his Highness was.\r\n  All the Lords were quartered up and down at these Fishermen’s Houses,\r\n  whereof these poor Men were glad. Now the camp began to be filled with\r\n  Officers and Souldiers; for no Officer must move from his Company or\r\n  Post. The Foot Guards belonging to the Prince of Orange did encamp\r\n  within an enclosure of plowed Land, about which there was a natural\r\n  Fence, good Hedges and little Stone Walls, so that no Horse could\r\n  touch them; Count Solms being their Colonel or Commander. Count\r\n  Nassau’s Regiment encamp’d in another Craft or Inclosure joyning to\r\n  that of the Guards, having the like Fence about it as before. The\r\n  Regiment belonging unto Colonel Fagell encamp’d in a Craft or\r\n  Inclosure next to that of Count Nassau, and so all the English, Dutch,\r\n  French, and Scots encamp’d according to the aforesaid manner. The\r\n  Souldiers were marching into the Camp all hours in the Night; and if\r\n  any straggled from their Companies, it was no easy matter to find them\r\n  in the dark amongst so many thousands; so that continually some or\r\n  other were lost and enquiring after their Regiments.\r\n\r\n  It was a cold, frosty night, and the stars twinkl’d exceedingly;\r\n  besides, the Ground was very wet after so much Rain and ill Weather;\r\n  the Souldiers were to stand to their Arms the whole Night, at least to\r\n  be all in a readiness if anything should happen, or the enemy make an\r\n  Assault; and therefore sundry Souldiers were to fetch some old Hedges\r\n  and cut down green Wood to burn therewith, to make some Fire. Now one\r\n  Regiment beginning all the rest soon followed their Example. Those\r\n  that had Provision in their Snap-sacks (as most of the Souldiers had)\r\n  did broil it at the Fire, and others went into the villages\r\n  thereabouts to buy some fresh Provisions for their Officers, being we\r\n  were newly come from Sea; but alas! here was little Provision to be\r\n  gotten. There was a little Ale house amongst the Fishermen’s Houses\r\n  which was so extremely throng^d and crowded that a Man could not\r\n  thrust in his Head, not get Bread or Ale for Mony. It was a happy time\r\n  for the Landlord, who strutted about as if indeed he had been a Lord\r\n  himself, because he was honoured with Lords’ Company.\r\n\r\nThe little “ale-house” was probably the Buller’s Arms, which is still in\r\nexistence. Report says that the Prince himself slept there, though this\r\nis doubtful, and that he left behind him there, or where he slept, a\r\nring, which fell into the possession of the landlord, and was preserved\r\nwith great care by subsequent possessors, eventually coming into the\r\npossession of one Mary Churchward, who died somewhere about twenty years\r\nago, from whom the ring was stolen some years before her death by a\r\nthief who entered her bedroom at night and carried it off owing to the\r\nlady being in the habit of sleeping with her window open. Persons now in\r\nBrixham remember the lady bitterly lamenting the loss of the ring on\r\naccount of its having belonged to the Prince of Orange.\r\n\r\nWhittle continues:—\r\n\r\n  On the morrow after we landed, when all the Souldiers were encamp’d,\r\n  the Prince with sundry Noblemen rode and viewed each Regiment, and\r\n  then return’d to Dinner at this little House. The number of his\r\n  Highness’s Regiments landed here at this Bay was about six and twenty,\r\n  the number of Officers about one thousand, the number of Field\r\n  Officers about seventy-eight. The number of all his Forces and\r\n  Souldiers about fifteen thousand four hundred and odd men. You might\r\n  have seen several hundred Fires all at once in this Encampment, which\r\n  must needs signify to the Country round about that we were landed. The\r\n  Prince here was pleased to accept of Peoples Good-Will for the Deed,\r\n  because things were not here to be bought for Mony, no Market-Town\r\n  being near. Many People from all the adjacent places came flocking to\r\n  see the Prince of Orange. The Horses were landed with all the speed\r\n  that might be, and truly were much out of order, and sorely bruised,\r\n  not able to find their Legs for some days: Everything that was of\r\n  present use was posted to shoar, but the Artillery, Magazine, and all\r\n  sorts of Baggage and cumbersome things were left on Shipboard, and\r\n  order’d to meet us at Exeter.\r\n\r\nWhittles reference to the fact that many people from the adjacent places\r\ncame flocking to see the Prince is confirmed by other writers.\r\n\r\nLocal tradition in my own family, handed down from parent to child with\r\nno little pride, says that among those who flocked to see the Prince\r\nfrom here were two Windeatts, Samuel and Thomas—father and son, and a\r\nlady whose great niece subsequently intermarried with the Windeatts. At\r\nthe time of the Prince’s landing, Samuel Windeatt, a man about forty,\r\nand a strict Nonconformist, was living in Bridgetown, where the family\r\nhad been settled for some years. Hearing the joyful news that the\r\nProtestant Prince of Orange was in Torbay, he immediately set off to\r\n“Broxholme” on horseback, taking his little son Thomas, then about eight\r\nyears old, in front of him, to see the Deliverer of England and his\r\ntroops. They narrated the fact on their return that the country people\r\naround brought quantities of apples and rolled them down the hill to the\r\nsoldiers; and the truth of this incident was curiously confirmed some\r\nyears since. A member of my family having mentioned this to a gentleman\r\nwho in his early days farmed in this part of the country, he gave me the\r\nfollowing interesting account of the stories handed down to him:—\r\n\r\n  There are few now left who can say as I can that they have heard their\r\n  father and their wife’s father talking together of the men who saw the\r\n  landing of William the Third at Torbay. I have heard Capt. Clements\r\n  say he as a boy heard as many as seven or eight old men each giving\r\n  the particulars of what he saw then. One said a ship load of horses\r\n  hauled up to the Quay and the horses walked out all harnessed, and the\r\n  quickness with which each man knew his horse and mounted it surprised\r\n  them. Another old man said, “I helped to get on shore the horses that\r\n  were thrown overboard and swam on shore, guided by only a single rope\r\n  running from the ship to the shore”; and another would describe the\r\n  difference in the rigging and build of the ships, but all appeared to\r\n  welcome them as friends.\r\n\r\n  My father remembered only one “Gaffer Will Webber,” of Staverton, who\r\n  served his apprenticeship with one of his ancestors, and who lived to\r\n  a great age, say, that he went from Staverton as a boy, with his\r\n  father, who took a cart-load of apples from Staverton to the high-road\r\n  from Brixham to Exeter, that the soldiers might help themselves to\r\n  them, and to wish them “God-speed.”\r\n\r\nI merely mention this to show how easily _tradition_ can be handed down,\r\nrequiring only three or four individuals, for two centuries.\r\n\r\nThe lady I referred to as one of those who flocked to see the Prince was\r\na Miss Juliana Babbage, from a brother of whom the late Charles Babbage,\r\nthe famous mathematician, was descended. She came, when a girl of\r\ntwelve, from Barbadoes, and was also a decided Nonconformist. On the 5th\r\nNovember, 1688, she was attending the old meeting-house in Totnes, at a\r\nthanksgiving service for the discovery of the gunpowder plot, and while\r\nthere was told that the Prince of Orange was in Torbay landing his\r\ntroops. She also hailed the news with joy, and as soon as service was\r\nover set off to walk to Brixham, accompanied by an old lady of her\r\nacquaintance, and making their way to the Prince, they boldly welcomed\r\nhim to England. He shook hands with them, and gave them some of his\r\nproclamations to distribute, which they did so industriously that not\r\none was left in the family as a memorial. A crimson velvet and gold\r\npurse, a pincushion, and a gold chain, which she is said to have worn on\r\nthe occasion, as well as a curious gold locket with hair belonging to\r\nher, are still in the possession of our family.\r\n\r\nThese stories come to me from a relative who has attained an honoured\r\nold age, who, owing to the early death of her mother, passed her\r\nchildhood and girlhood in an old family circle, and heard from the lips\r\nof those elderly relatives tales of old times, which they had received\r\nin like manner from their relatives. This lady says her grandmother told\r\nher she well recollected her father joking her mother as to what might\r\nhave happened if the Prince had not succeeded, saying, “Oh! mistress,\r\nyour aunt might have swung for it!”\r\n\r\nThe terror infused into the minds of the men of the West by the bitter\r\npersecution which followed the unsuccessful rising on behalf of the Duke\r\nof Monmouth, was doubtless sufficient to deter the leading men from\r\nopenly espousing the Prince’s cause at this moment.\r\n\r\nThe first gentleman of any position to do so, and this he probably did\r\nat Brixham, as he lived in the neighbourhood, was Mr. Nicholas Roope,\r\nwho was appropriately rewarded for his adhesion to the Prince by being\r\nappointed, within a short time of the Prince reaching St. James’,\r\nGovernor of Dartmouth Castle, in the room of Sir Edward Seymour the\r\nelder, who had then recently died.\r\n\r\nIn an interesting letter from the last Governor of Dartmouth Castle\r\n(Governor Holdsworth) to Sir H. P. Seale, Bart., dated May 1st, 1857,\r\nthe warrant for his appointment is set out in full. It runs in the name\r\nof William Henry, Prince of Orange, and is dated 7th of January, 1688–9,\r\nand this was followed, on the 18th July of the same year (1689), by a\r\nregular commission, when the Prince had become King of England.\r\n\r\nThe authority for the statement that Mr. Roope was the first to join the\r\nKing is contained in a letter from Mr. Roope to the Earl of Nottingham\r\nin reply to one from his Lordship containing a complaint against him.\r\nThese letters are set out in full in Governor Holdsworth’s letter.\r\n\r\nAt Berry Pomeroy, some few miles distant from the scene of the Prince’s\r\nlanding, was then living Sir Edward Seymour the younger, sometime\r\nSpeaker of the House of Commons, son of the Seymour who was Roope’s\r\npredecessor in the Governorship of Dartmouth Castle, and one of the most\r\ninfluential men of his time, whose birth, says Macaulay, put him on a\r\nlevel with the noblest subjects in Europe, and who, in political\r\ninfluence and in Parliamentary abilities was beyond comparison the\r\nforemost among the Tory gentlemen of England. He openly joined the\r\nPrince at Exeter, and he it was who contributed greatly to the success\r\nof the Prince’s cause by suggesting that an association should be\r\nfounded, and that all the English adherents of the Prince should put\r\ntheir hands to an instrument binding them to be true to their leader and\r\nto each other. He doubtless was well informed of what was now going on\r\nat Brixham, and we can hardly imagine him to have been a passive\r\nspectator of the great enterprise. Tradition says that the Prince had a\r\nsecret interview with him at a house, now a cluster of labourers’\r\ncottages, still known as Parliament House, situate on the confines of\r\nBerry parish on the road from Berry House to Brixham, and that there he\r\nagreed to come out for the Prince at Exeter, for which city he was\r\nmember. Another account gives the place of meeting at Marldon, at a spot\r\nnow called Parliament Hill. The present Duke of Somerset, with whom I\r\nhave communicated on this point, has been good enough to inform me that\r\nhe believes the building called Parliament House to have been the place\r\nwhere the country gentlemen assembled and agreed to support the Prince,\r\nand that the latter probably had some interview with Seymour at that\r\ntime, as it was by his inducement that the country gentlemen, when they\r\nmet at Exeter, signed their names to the paper I have been referred to,\r\npromising to support the Prince, and that for this probably the Prince\r\nappointed him Governor of Exeter.\r\n\r\nHis Grace also informs me that the late Duke, who had the family papers\r\nexamined, said that all documents relating to these transactions\r\nappeared to have been carefully destroyed, and that this precaution was\r\nnatural after the recent failure of Monmouth’s landing in the West of\r\nEngland, though it deprives us, as he says, of many incidents that would\r\nnow be very interesting.\r\n\r\nThere is little information to be gained from the parish records of\r\nBrixham on the subject of this paper, but from them it appears that at\r\nleast one poor nameless foreigner was left behind at Brixham when the\r\nPrince’s army began its march to Exeter, and probably succumbed to the\r\neffects of the voyage, which, from Whittle’s narrative, appears to have\r\nbeen fatal to five hundred horses; for in the Register of Burials for\r\nthe parish for the year 1688 there appears the following entry:—\r\n\r\n        Nov. 21, a fforeigner belonging to the Prenz of Oringe.\r\n\r\nIn another book, containing an account of those buried in woollen, in\r\naccordance with the law passed to encourage that trade, the entry is as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n              November 21, a Dutchman cujus nomen ignotum.\r\n\r\nThere is a steep lane leading from the outer harbour up the hill to\r\nwhere the station now stands, which the present vicar of Brixham\r\nconsiders derives its name, Overgang, apparently a Dutch word, from\r\n“Obergang,” or Gang-ober or “over,” and that it arose from the fact of\r\ntroops after the landing being repeatedly ordered to gang over this\r\nhill. This may be so; but as I find that the word “gang,” meaning to go\r\nor to walk, was in use in England in the time of Spenser, it is not\r\nimprobable that this lane gained its name before the advent of the\r\nPrince of Orange.\r\n\r\nThe Prince’s army marched from Brixham on its way to Newton on the 6th\r\nor 7th November, passing along the narrow lanes of Churston, Paignton,\r\nCockington, and Kingskerswell, taking apparently a part of two days on\r\nthe march, the roads being so bad as to make locomotion slow and\r\ntedious.\r\n\r\nReport says that at a place called Collins’ Grave, near the higher lodge\r\nat Churston, where there is high ground overlooking the river, the army\r\nencamped one night; also that the Prince himself stayed at a house in\r\nPaignton, now the Crown and Anchor Inn. A room there is still shown as\r\nthe “Prince’s room.”\r\n\r\nIn a Protestant sense it is interesting that William landed within sight\r\nof the Bible Tower at Paignton, where Coverdale, the translator of the\r\nBible, undoubtedly dwelt, and where he is said to have been probably\r\nengaged on his translation; and doubtless this tradition was not lost\r\nsight of by those about the Prince on his sleeping at the “Crown and\r\nAnchor,” just outside the palace wall.\r\n\r\nThe following is Whittle’s graphic account of the march to Newton:—\r\n\r\n  Upon Wednesday about Noon, Order was given to march towards Exeter,\r\n  and so every Souldier was commanded by their Officers to carry\r\n  something or other besides his own Arms and Snap-sack, and this made\r\n  many murmur exceedingly. Sundry scores of Horses were thrown overboard\r\n  which died at Sea, so that by just Computation the Prince lost about\r\n  six hundred Horses at least by the Storm. As we marched here upon good\r\n  ground, the Souldiers would stumble and sometimes fall, because of a\r\n  dissiness in their Heads after they had been so long toss’d at Sea,\r\n  the very ground seem’d to rowl up and down for some days, according to\r\n  the manner of the Waves: Therefore, it is the Lords Goodness that our\r\n  Foes did not come upon us in this juncture and unfit Condition. The\r\n  whole Army marched all the same way, in a manner which made very ill\r\n  for the Rear Regiments, and cast them much behind. Many Country People\r\n  which met us did not know what to say or think, being afraid that we\r\n  should be served as the D. of Monmouth’s handful of Men were.\r\n  Notwithstanding, some were so courageous as to speak out and say,\r\n  truly their Hearts were for us, and went along with us, and pray’d for\r\n  the Prince of Orange; but they said the Irish would come and cut them\r\n  in pieces if it should be known. Some Souldiers asked them if they\r\n  would go with them against the Popists? and many answered they were\r\n  enough themselves, and wanted no more. His Highness, with Mareschal\r\n  Scomberg, Count Sohms, Count Nassau, Heer Benting, Heer Zulustein,\r\n  Earl of Shrewsbury, Earl of Macclesfield, Viscount Mordaunt, Lord\r\n  Wiltshire, and divers other Knights and Gentlemen, came in the Rear of\r\n  the middle Line; for as soon as we could conveniently, we were to\r\n  march in three Lines, and the Prince was commonly or always in the\r\n  middlemost Line, which was the meetest place. So he went unto a\r\n  certain Gentleman’s House, about two miles off, where the last Line\r\n  encamp’d the Second Night, and lodged there, his own Guards being with\r\n  him. The first day we marched some hours after Night in the Dark and\r\n  Rain; the lanes hereabout were very narrow, and not used to Wagons,\r\n  Carts or Coaches, and therefore extreme rough and stony, which\r\n  hindered us very much from making any speed. Divers of the Dutchmen\r\n  being unaccustomed to such bad ways and hard marching in the Dirt,\r\n  wished themselves back again in their own Country, and murmured\r\n  because of the Dark and Rain. At length we came to the Corn-stubble\r\n  Inclosures on the side of a Hill, where we encamp’d that Night. It was\r\n  a red clay, and it rain’d very hard the greatest part of the Night;\r\n  the Winds being high and stormy. Nevertheless, the poor Souldiers\r\n  being much wearied with the Tent-Polls, Spare Arms, and other Utensils\r\n  for War, which they had carried all Day and some hours after Night, as\r\n  well as with the badness of the March, lay down to take their Repose;\r\n  and verily the water run over and under some of their legs the major\r\n  part of the Night, and their Heads, Backs and Arms sunck deep into the\r\n  Clay, being so very wet and soft, notwithstanding they slept all Night\r\n  very sweetly, in their Pee or Campagne Coats. The Souldiers here\r\n  fetch’d some old Hedges and Gates to make their Officers and\r\n  themselves some Fire (as they had done the night before), else some\r\n  would have perished in the Cold, being all over in a Froth with Sweat\r\n  in marching. And the old Hedges and Gates not being enough, they\r\n  fetch’d away the new ones, for the Weather was not only raw and cold\r\n  but we ourselves were so too, having nothing to eat or drink after so\r\n  bad a day’s journey. The Souldiers had some good Holland’s Beef in\r\n  their Snap-sacks, which they brought, and their Officers were very\r\n  glad to get part with them, so they broil’d it at the Fire; some had\r\n  bought Chickens by the way, but raw, which they broil’d and eat as a\r\n  most delicate Dish. Sundry Captains offer’d any Mony for a Guide to\r\n  bring them to a House thereabout, where they might have some provision\r\n  for their money, but no Guide could be found; it was exceeding dark,\r\n  and being all Strangers and unacquainted with the Country, we could\r\n  not tell where to find one House, for those few that were scattering\r\n  here and there were either in some little grove of Trees, and so hid\r\n  from our Eyes, or else in a bottom amongst the Hills, and so could not\r\n  be seen. These Quarters did not content our Minds, for tho’ we got as\r\n  near to the Hedges as we could possible with our Fires, yet we could\r\n  not be warm. Many of the Souldiers slept with their feet in the Ditch,\r\n  and their Heads on the side thereof. We thought this Night almost as\r\n  long as that in the Storm at Sea; and judged it to be the dawn of Day\r\n  some hours before it was. The Morning appearing rejoiced our very\r\n  Hearts, for we thought now we should march presently; and we were sure\r\n  of this, that worse Quarters we could never meet with, but much better\r\n  we hoped to find. A private souldier, therefore, going in the next\r\n  Croft for to seek a convenient place, he found it to be an Inclosure\r\n  with Turnips, so bringing his Burden away with him, he came to the\r\n  Fire and gave those there some, telling his Comrades of the Place, who\r\n  soon hastened thereto, and brought enow with them: Some roasted them\r\n  and others eat them raw, and made a brave Banquet. The Souldiers were\r\n  busy in discharging their Musquets, after the Wet and Rain, for they\r\n  durst not trust to that Charge; and about 11 of the Clock the Army\r\n  received Orders to march.\r\n\r\n  The Prince of Orange with the Lords and Gentlemen, rode from this\r\n  place unto Sir William Courtenay’s, within a mile of Newton Abbot, the\r\n  first Line being about Newton, and the last on their march thither.\r\n  The Place where we encamped was trodden to Dirt, and stuck to our\r\n  Shoes wretchedly. Now the Regiments marched sundry Roads, of which we\r\n  were right glad, hoping to meet with better Quarters than the Marl and\r\n  Clay Crofts. The People came in flocks unto the Cross-ways to see the\r\n  Army, but especially the Prince. We met with much civility on the\r\n  Road; now they began to give us Applause, and pray for our Success;\r\n  sundry Persons enquired for the Declaration of his Highness.\r\n\r\nArrived near Newton, the Prince, as Whittle says, went to Ford House,\r\nwithin a short distance of the town, the residence of Sir William\r\nCourtenay, who endeavoured cautiously to abstain from doing anything to\r\ncompromise himself with the King, should the latter prevail, and so\r\nmanaged not to be at home on the Prince’s arrival, but left directions\r\nthat he should be hospitably lodged and feasted. Here he probably stayed\r\ntwo nights to enable the whole of the troops to come up and be in order\r\nfor the march to Exeter, to which place Dr. Burnet and Lord Mordaunt\r\nwith four troops of horse were sent on in advance.\r\n\r\nThe room at Ford House in which the Prince slept is still pointed out;\r\nit is called the “Orange room,” and is papered and upholstered in\r\norange.\r\n\r\nMr. Blewitt, in the _Panorama of Torquay_, says:—“It is _said_ that his\r\nfirst proclamation was read from the base of the ancient cross at Newton\r\nby the Rev. John Reynell, the minister of Wolborough”; and Mr. White, in\r\nhis valuable _History of Torquay_, published in 1878, repeats this\r\nstatement as a fact. The stone pedestal on which formerly stood the\r\nancient cross, still remains near the tower at Newton, in the parish of\r\nWolborough, and is now surmounted by a public lamp. On this pedestal is\r\nthe following inscription:—\r\n\r\n                        THE FIRST DECLARATION OF\r\n                    WILLIAM III., PRINCE OF ORANGE,\r\n                      THE GLORIOUS DEFENDER OF THE\r\n                         LIBERTIES OF ENGLAND,\r\n                      WAS READ ON THIS PEDESTAL BY\r\n                         THE REV. JOHN REYNELL,\r\n                         RECTOR OF THIS PARISH,\r\n                             5TH NOVEMBER,\r\n                                 1688.\r\n\r\nThat the Prince’s declaration was read from the old cross there can be\r\nlittle doubt, but that the inscription cannot be looked upon as much of\r\nan authority is clear from the statement that the declaration was read\r\non the 5th; for the Prince’s army did not commence to land at Brixham\r\nuntil that day, and could not have possibly reached Newton until the\r\n7th; and that it is erroneous also in stating that it was read by\r\nReynell is evident from the following very interesting paragraph from\r\nWhittle’s Diary:—\r\n\r\n  Now being on their march to Newton Abbot, a certain Divine went before\r\n  the Army; and finding that ’twas their Market-day, he went unto the\r\n  Cross, or Town Hall; where, pulling out the Declaration of the Prince\r\n  of Orange, with undaunted Resolution, he began, with a loud and\r\n  audible voice, to read as follows: William Henry, by the Grace of God,\r\n  Prince of Orange, &c., of the Reasons inducing him to appear in Arms\r\n  in the Kingdom of England, for preserving of the Protestant Religion,\r\n  and restoring the Laws and Liberties of England, Scotland, and\r\n  Ireland, &c.\r\n\r\n  When the people heard the Prince of Orange’s name mentioned, they\r\n  immediately crowded about him in a prodigious manner to hear him,\r\n  insomuch that some jeoparded their lives.\r\n\r\n  The Declaration being ended, he said, God bless and preserve the\r\n  Prince of Orange: To which the People, with one Heart and Voice,\r\n  answered Amen, Amen; and forthwith shouted for Joy, and made the Town\r\n  ring with their echoing Huzzas. The Minister, _nolens volens_, was\r\n  carried into a Chamber near the Place: the Windows were shut, the\r\n  doors lock’d and bolted, to prevent the crowd from rushing in.\r\n\r\n  The People of the House, and others very kindly asked him: Sir, What\r\n  will you be pleased to eat? or, What shall we provide for you? Name\r\n  what you love best, it shall be had. The Minister answered, What you\r\n  please, give me what you will. So they brought forth such as was\r\n  ready; and having eaten and drunk well, they desired him to spare them\r\n  but one Declaration. Yes, says he, for I have enow in my Pocket, and\r\n  pulling them out, he gave Three, because they were of distinct\r\n  Parishes. He told the People, he would go and visit their Minister,\r\n  and cause their Bells to ring, because the Prince of Orange was come\r\n  into the Parish, at Sir Will Courtney’s, tho’ not into the Town; and\r\n  (says he) this being the first Market-Town, I cannot but think it much\r\n  the more proper and expedient. Whereupon he went to the Minister’s\r\n  House, and enquiring for him he was courteously invited in, and\r\n  desired to sit down: The Reverend Minister of the Parish coming\r\n  presently to him, they saluted each other; and after some\r\n  communications passed between them, this Divine from the Army, desired\r\n  the Keys of his Church Doors, for to welcome the Prince of Orange into\r\n  England with a Peal (that being the first Market-Town they came to).\r\n  The Minister answered; Sir, for my own part, I am ready to serve his\r\n  Highness any way, but of my own accord cannot give the Keys; but you\r\n  know you may command them, or anything else in my House in the Name of\r\n  the Prince of Orange, and then I will readily grant it. So the Divine\r\n  said: Sir, I demand your Keys of the Church Door only for an hour to\r\n  give his Highness a Peal, and then I will return them safely unto you.\r\n\r\n  The Minister presently directed him to the Clerk’s house, and desired\r\n  him to come and take a Glass of Wine with him after the Peal was\r\n  ended, (but the Ringers coming together, they rung sundry Peals) and\r\n  he returned the Keys to the Minister.\r\n\r\n  The People of the Town were exceeding Joyful, and began to drink the\r\n  Prince of Orange’s Health. The Country People in the Town were well\r\n  inclined towards us; and here was the first favour we met with worth\r\n  mentioning. His Highness was most kindly receiv’d and entertain’d at\r\n  Sir Will Courtney’s, the Souldiers generally well treated by the\r\n  Vulgar.\r\n\r\nOldmixon, in his _History of the Reign of the Stuarts_, simply says that\r\n“the first place the Prince of Orange’s Declaration was publicly read\r\nwas Newton Abbot, a market town near Exeter, and the first man who read\r\nit was _a_ clergyman.” No doubt the fact that it was read by a clergyman\r\ngradually changed into the statement that it was read by _the_ clergyman\r\nof the parish, and so Reynell became credited with a bold act, which,\r\nfrom Whittle’s account, he was far too cautious a man to commit, however\r\nfavourable he may have been to the Prince’s cause. The lettering of the\r\ninscription is evidently modern, and the Rev. H. Tudor, the present\r\nRector of Wolborough, informs me that a man, now dead, told him he was\r\nemployed to cut or re-cut it, and was never paid for doing so.\r\n\r\nThe question remains, and it is an interesting one, who was the divine\r\nwho first proclaimed the Prince by reading the Declaration? I was first\r\ninclined to believe, from the detailed manner in which the story was\r\ntold, that it was Whittle himself. It is not improbable, however, that\r\nit was the renowned Dr. Burnet, afterwards Bishop Burnet. He was the\r\nPrince’s own chaplain, and doubtless the head and chief of the clergy\r\nwho accompanied the Prince, and from his undaunted spirit, and the\r\nleading part he took in the Cathedral at Exeter, he was undoubtedly the\r\ndivine most likely to have performed this act. One gentleman with whom I\r\nhave been in communication on the point, and whose opinion always\r\ncarries weight, says:—\r\n\r\n  Burnet was such a busybody, that I feel certain if anything was to be\r\n  done by a clergyman he would have put himself forward to do it.\r\n\r\nNo information is to be gleaned from the parish registers or the books I\r\nhave inspected relative to what occurred at Newton during the time of\r\nthe Prince’s visit, but I have been favoured with the following\r\ninteresting story from a lady now residing at Newton, of the advanced\r\nage of ninety-six, told her by her father, who heard it from his\r\ngrandmother, who was a Miss Joan Bearne, the daughter of Mr. Bearne, a\r\nlawyer of Newton Abbot; viz., that when a girl of sixteen, there was a\r\nstranger staying at her father’s house for about three weeks, who was\r\nonly known as “the gentleman,” and who was out during the day, and only\r\nreturned in the evening; that on the entry of William of Orange into\r\nNewton from Ford House, her father took her out to see him, and that\r\nwalking by the side of the Prince was the strange gentleman, who, on\r\npassing where Mr. Bearne was standing, pointed him out as “his host for\r\nthree weeks” to the Prince, who at once lifted his hat to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: leaf]\r\n\r\n  [This paper having been written in 1880, sundry allusions must be\r\n  interpreted in the light of that circumstance.—THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REYNOLDS’ BIRTHPLACE.\r\n\r\n                       BY JAMES HINE, F.R.I.B.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny interest attaching to Plympton belongs to the olden time. Of many\r\nother places it may be said that the new has entirely supplanted the\r\nold. Modern business requirements, new warehouses, and thoroughfares,\r\nhave had the effect of stamping out all vestiges of the past, and even\r\nthe traditions of them. An unpretending Railway Station and a dozen or\r\nmore new houses have not had this effect at Plympton. The town has no\r\nnovelties to shew us; the lions are just what they were two hundred\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nPlympton in the olden time had its castle and its priory, its two\r\nchurches, and later its Guildhall and Grammar School. Not quite in the\r\nolden time, but only just on the verge of our prosaic modern time,\r\nPlympton gave to the world England’s greatest painter—a circumstance\r\nwhich (though forgotten by the native, who on being asked by a tourist\r\nwhere Sir Joshua Reynolds was born, replied he “never heeard of sich”)\r\nshould indeed make this honoured little town almost as famous as\r\nStratford-on-Avon.\r\n\r\nIn the Doomsday Book, Plympton is designated “Terra Regis,” so also are\r\nTavistock, Ashburton, and Tiverton, “all which places were then the\r\nKing’s demesne towns,” but not boroughs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\n               _From an Engraving_]     [_by J. E. Wood._\r\n                THE CLOISTERS, PLYMPTON GRAMMAR SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\n               _From an Engraving_]     [_By J. E. Wood._\r\n                    NORMAN DOORWAY, PLYMPTON PRIORY.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nA date anterior to the Norman Conquest has been ascribed to the castle,\r\non the ground of its similarity to Trematon, Launceston, and Restormel\r\ncastles, which Borlase and Grose assert to have been built before the\r\nyear 900. The antiquaries, however, of the eighteenth century are often\r\nextremely inaccurate in their classification both of military and\r\necclesiastical structures. St. German’s Church, the ancient cathedral of\r\nCornwall, is designated Saxon by them, whereas its features, as any tyro\r\nwill now see, are undoubted Norman; in fact, there are no remains of\r\nSaxon architecture in Cornwall, and it would be surprising if there\r\nwere, seeing that the Saxons never had any permanent hold on this part\r\nof Britain; for, though Egbert is said to have reduced the Cornish\r\nBritons to “nominal subjection” about the year 810, we find that\r\nAthelstan as late as 936 was in conflict with the British forces, and\r\ndrove them across the Tamar, and not until that year had Exeter been\r\nsubjected to his government.\r\n\r\nRestormel Castle is undoubtedly of Norman construction, and it is\r\nprobable that the most ancient portions of Launceston Castle are nearly\r\ntwo centuries later than the date ascribed by Borlase.\r\n\r\nAlthough, therefore, from the naturally strong position of all these\r\ncastles, it is probable that the Britons occupied these positions for\r\ndefence, no visible remains can be considered as anterior to the Norman\r\nConquest. In the absence of any architectural details at Plympton\r\nCastle—the masonry in the walls being somewhat analogous to the British\r\nmasonry found in different parts of Cornwall—there may be more room for\r\ndoubt and conjecture here than in respect to the other castles; yet the\r\nrudeness of the masonry may be accounted for by supposing that only the\r\nvassal inhabitants of the neighbourhood were employed in the works,\r\nunder Norman architects and overseers.\r\n\r\nThe vestiges of Norman rule are clearly traceable in the county and\r\nborders of Devon. The same independent character which Exeter maintained\r\nagainst the Saxon authority, that city endeavoured to assert against the\r\nConqueror; and the obedience of the western capital required to be\r\ninsured by a number of castles, of a date not long subsequent to the\r\nConquest. The castles of Barnstaple, Exeter, Totnes, Plympton, and\r\nTrematon guarded the rivers which gave access to the interior of the\r\ncounty; and the fortresses of Okehampton, Launceston, Lydford, Berry,\r\nand Tiverton, the inland passes. Of the castles enumerated here, Berry\r\nat least has been entirely rebuilt at a later period.\r\n\r\nPlympton Castle was the chief residence of the Earls of Devon and Lords\r\nof Plympton. King Henry, the youngest son of the Conqueror, in the first\r\nyear of his reign, granted the Lordship to Richard de Redvers or Rivers\r\nand his posterity, to enjoy also the title and possessions belonging to\r\nthe Devonshire Earldom. The said Richard was one of William the\r\nConqueror’s generals in the battle of Hastings, and obtained the barony\r\nof Okehampton from William Rufus. He was one of the chief councillors of\r\nHenry the First, and was so highly esteemed by him that he was created\r\nfirst Earl of Devon since the Conquest. The castle stood on the north\r\nside of the town, occupying a space of about two acres, extending 700\r\nfeet from east to west, including the ditch, and 400 feet from north to\r\nsouth. Leland says of this structure, in his Itinerary, “On the side of\r\nthe town is a fair large castelle and dungeon in it, whereof the walls\r\nyet stand, though the lodgings be clean decayed.” At present there only\r\nremains a portion of the circular keep or tower, fifty feet in diameter,\r\non a mound about sixty feet high. The ruined walls average fourteen feet\r\nin height and are nine feet thick, grouted with mortar or concrete as\r\nhard as the stones themselves. Around the keep in the thickness of the\r\nwall is a plastered flue, fifteen inches by ten inches, the purpose of\r\nwhich is not obvious. It has been suggested that it was designed for the\r\nconveyance of sound. It seems more probable that it was for ventilation.\r\nThere is a similar flue at Rochester Castle. The habitable portions of\r\nPlympton Castle must have been of considerable extent. These, including\r\nthe state apartments, and lodgings (as Leland calls them) for the\r\nmilitary and retainers, were within the outer castle walls, and built\r\naround a spacious basse-court. The ballium wall—embattled and flanked\r\nwith towers—was raised on a platform about 30 feet above the fosse or\r\nditch, in the position now indicated by a modern path, and by a belt of\r\ntrees planted about a hundred years ago. The basse-court has long been a\r\nquiet village green, and the site of the ballium wall, where stern\r\nwarriors peered over frowning battlements, is now a “lovers’ walk.” Such\r\nare the tendencies of modern civilization. Surrounding the castle wall\r\nwas a deep moat about 40 feet wide, still to be traced, except on the\r\neastern side, where it has been filled up. In Leland’s time it was full\r\nof water, and stored with carp. There are no remains whatever of the\r\ngreat gateway of the castle (with its drawbridge and portcullis), which,\r\nas shewn by the seal of the Lords of Plympton, was on the north side.\r\nThere were probably towers at the different angles.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Baldwin de Rivers, second Earl of Devon and Lord of\r\nPlympton, the castle was the scene of events which strikingly illustrate\r\nthe then unsettled state of the country, and the insubordination of even\r\nthe most privileged class. Baldwin de Rivers was considered one of the\r\nrichest and bravest men of the age; but having with some other nobles\r\nrebelled against King Stephen, on account, it is said, of the king\r\nrefusing to confer certain honours on them, he fortified himself in his\r\ncastle at Exeter, where he was besieged by the monarch; and it appears\r\nthat certain knights, to whom he had entrusted his castle of Plympton,\r\nbeing apprehensive of the Earl’s danger, or alarmed about their own\r\nsafety, treated for the surrender of Plympton; and the king sent two\r\nhundred men with a large body of archers from Exeter to Plympton, who\r\nunexpectedly appeared under the walls of the castle about daybreak, and,\r\naccording to the chronicler, the fortress was then almost entirely\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe lands of the Earl, which extended far and wide round Plympton\r\nCastle, and said to have been abundantly stocked and well cultivated,\r\nwere harried by the king’s troops, who drove off to Exeter many\r\nthousands of sheep and oxen.[6] Baldwin was then dispossessed of all his\r\nhonours, and banished the kingdom; but afterwards siding with the\r\nEmpress Matilda, in the civil wars which ensued, he was restored to all\r\nhis honours and possessions by Henry II. He died A.D. 1155, and was\r\nsucceeded by his son, Richard de Redvers.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Devonshire wool was already a valuable commodity, and was bought at\r\n  that time, it is said, by Flemish merchants who frequented Devonshire\r\n  ports.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBaldwin, the eighth Earl, was the last of the male Redvers or Rivers who\r\nheld the barony of Plympton. His death, by poison, occurred in France in\r\n1262, and the inheritance of the Earls of Devon and Lords of Plympton\r\ndescended to Isabella de Redvers, the wife of the Earl of Albemarle, who\r\nstyled herself Countess of Devon. Their only issue was a daughter,\r\nAveline, who married the Earl of Lancaster, and she dying in 1293,\r\nwithout issue, Hugh Lord Courtenay, next heir to Isabella, Countess of\r\nDevon, and lineally descended from John Courtenay, Lord of Okehampton,\r\nwho married the daughter of Sir William de Redvers, became ninth Earl.\r\n\r\nThe possession by the Courtenays during succeeding centuries of the\r\nEarldom of Devon and the Barony of Plympton, was marked by many\r\ninteresting and even tragical incidents, but these have no very\r\nimmediate connection with the subject of this paper.[7]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  One remarkable circumstance—mentioned by Pole—concerning Henry\r\n  Courtenay, created Earl in 1525, may be noted. “This Henry,” says\r\n  Pole, “was soe intimate unto King Henry the 8th, that having no issue\r\n  he intended to have made hym his successor unto the crown; but\r\n  afterwards he fell into high displeasure of the King, so, as being\r\n  questioned with divers others for ayding of Cardinale Poole, and\r\n  intencion for the raising of forces on the Pope’s behalf, he was\r\n  arraigned, convicted, and executed for treason.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe barony of Plympton was subdivided in the reign of Queen Mary. In the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century it was in the hands of three\r\nfamilies. It is now invested in the Earl of Morley.\r\n\r\nThe castle (probably rebuilt after its partial demolition in the time of\r\nBaldwin de Rivers, second Earl) does not appear to have been much\r\nmolested between the reigns of Stephen and Charles I.; at least, we have\r\nno record of any memorable event during that long interval.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Civil War, Plympton was the headquarters of the\r\nforce which the Royalists then had in the county. It was one of the\r\nprincipal quarters of Prince Maurice’s army whilst besieging Plymouth,\r\nfrom October, 1642, to January, 1643. The King had a garrison here,\r\nwhich, however, was taken by the Earl of Essex, in the month of July,\r\n1644. The castle at this period was mounted with eight pieces of\r\nordnance.\r\n\r\nThe fertile valley of the Plym was often a tempting field for plunder to\r\nthe Plymouth parliamentary troops, as it had been to the archers of King\r\nStephen five centuries before. Its rich pasturage and produce induced a\r\nfraternity of pious monks at a very early period to settle here; which\r\nbrings me to speak of the once famous priory of Plympton, the richest\r\nand most flourishing in Devon.\r\n\r\nThe first monastery or college existing here is said to have been\r\nfounded by one of the Saxon kings, possibly Ethelwolf, who had a palace,\r\nso tradition informs us, at Yealmpton, about four miles distant. This\r\nestablishment, however, early came to grief. Leland says:—\r\n\r\n  The glory of this towne (Plymptoun Marie) stoode by the priorie of\r\n  blake chanons, there buildid and richely endowid with landes.\r\n\r\n  The original beginning of this priorie was after this fascion: one\r\n  William Warwist, bisshop of Excester, displeased with the chanons or\r\n  prebendaries of a fre chapelle of the fundation of the Saxon kinges,\r\n  because they wold not leve theyr concubines, found meanes to dissolve\r\n  their college, wherein was a deane or provost, and four prebendaries,\r\n  with other ministers.\r\n\r\n  The prebende of Plympton self was the title of one, and the prebend of\r\n  S. Peter and Paule at Sultown, now caullid Plymmouth, another. Bisshop\r\n  Warwist, to recompence the prebendaries of Plympton, erectid a college\r\n  of as many as wer ther at Bosenham in Southsax, and annexid the gift\r\n  of them to his successors, bisshops of Excester. Then he set up at\r\n  Plympton a priorie of canons regular, and after was ther buried in the\r\n  chapitre house.\r\n\r\n  Diverse noble men gave after landes to this priorie, emong whom was\r\n  Walterus de Valletorta, lord of Tremerton, in Cornewal, and, as sum\r\n  say, of Totnes, who gave onto Plymtown priorie the isle of S. Nicholas\r\n  cum cuniculis, conteyning a two acres of ground, or more, and lying at\r\n  the mouthes of Tamar and Plym ryvers.\r\n\r\n  There were buryed sum of Courteneis and diverse other gentilmen in the\r\n  chirch of the priorie of Plymtoun.\r\n\r\nThe second establishment, then—dedicated to the Virgin Mary and SS.\r\nPeter and Paul—of the Order of St. Augustine, was founded in 1121 by\r\nWilliam Warelwast, Bishop of Exeter, the nephew and chaplain of William\r\nthe Conqueror. He was one of the most gifted and energetic ecclesiastics\r\nof his day, and to him we are indebted for the earliest existing\r\nportions of Exeter Cathedral, including the two noble Norman towers. He\r\nseems to have set his heart on making Plympton priory the richest and\r\nmost important in this part of the kingdom, and conveyed to it very\r\nlarge properties in Exeter. Many noblemen followed his example.\r\n\r\nThe rental of the priory shows that certain lands and rents were\r\nattached to the several conventual offices of almoner, precentor,\r\ncellarer, and chaplain of the infirmary.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the wealth of the monastery may be gathered from the fact\r\nthat at the dissolution it was rated at £912 12_s._ 8_d._ per annum,\r\nwhereas the whole annual revenue of the 173 Augustine priories in the\r\nkingdom amounted to £33,027, the average being about one-fourth that of\r\nPlympton.\r\n\r\nThe founder, Bishop Warelwast, was buried here (as Leland says) in the\r\nchapter house of the priory, as were also the remains of his nephew, the\r\nfifth Bishop of Exeter. “Whoever is acquainted,” says Dr. Oliver, “with\r\nthe deeds and writings of subsequent bishops, the immediate patrons of\r\nPlympton Priory, must have observed how closely they imitated the zeal\r\nof the founder in watching and guarding its interests and promoting its\r\nwelfare.” Amongst other privileges, the prior and convent possessed the\r\nright of appointing the rural dean of Plympton.\r\n\r\nThe venerable building had been destroyed before Leland’s time, as is\r\nevident from his saying “the chirch that there a late stood,” meaning,\r\nof course, the priory church.\r\n\r\n“At present,” says Dr. Oliver, “scarcely a vestige remains of any of the\r\nconventual buildings”; but in this respect, as we shall hereafter see,\r\nhe is not quite correct.\r\n\r\nWithin one hundred and fifty years after the erection of the priory\r\nchurch, another sacred edifice was required for the growing population\r\naround; and Bishop Stapeldon, on Friday, October 29th, 1311, consecrated\r\none in honour of the Virgin Mary, for the use of the parishioners. The\r\npresent chancel and north aisle of Plympton St. Mary Church are portions\r\nof the church then dedicated, the great body of the church, as we now\r\nsee it, having been re-built in a later age and style. It was situate\r\n“_infra cemeterium prioratus_”; and, as a mark of subjection, the\r\nparishioners were required to assist at divine service in the conventual\r\nchurch on the feast of its dedication, and to receive the blest palms\r\nthere on Palm Sunday, and walk in the solemn procession of that day.\r\nThis obligation was sanctioned by Archbishop Courtenay, when he made a\r\nvisitation of the diocese of Exeter in 1387, and confirmed by Pope\r\nBoniface IX. For some neglect of this ancient custom Bishop Lacy\r\nexpressed his high displeasure, and enjoined its strict observance in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nIn Plympton St. Mary parish there were several chapels, subject to the\r\npriory—one at Newnham, another at Hemerdon, and a chapel attached to a\r\nlazar-house, of which there are now no remains. Sutton or South-town,\r\nnow part of Plymouth, belonged to the priory of Plympton. “In the\r\npriors’ court there the portreve of the commonality was elected and\r\nsworne into office by his steward, and the markets, the instruments of\r\npunishment, and the assize of provisions belonged to him.”\r\n\r\nThose were not exactly the “furzy down” days of Plymouth; but it was\r\nquite an insignificant place at that time, compared with its more\r\nwealthy neighbour, Plympton. Its great market, in fact, was Plympton. As\r\nPlymouth grew into more importance, as a naval as well as fishing\r\nstation, and as the inhabitants became more influential, they naturally\r\nbecame anxious to obtain independence and the right of self-government,\r\nwith municipal privileges. Accordingly, the inhabitants petitioned the\r\nking and parliament to be incorporated as early as 1412, and the answer\r\nto the petition was, “Let the petitioners compound with the lords having\r\nfranchises before the next parliament, and report to them of their\r\nhaving made an agreement.” As a matter of course, the prior and convent\r\nat first opposed their views, but when the inhabitants succeeded, in\r\n1439, in obtaining the royal licence and an Act of Parliament, which\r\nconstituted them a corporation, under the title of the Mayor and\r\nCommonalty of the Borough of Plymouth, it was time for the prior and\r\nconvent to come to terms with the reformers; and animated with an\r\nexcellent feeling, they addressed a petition to Bishop Lacy,\r\nrepresenting that it would be desirable to convey to this municipal body\r\ncertain lands, tenements, franchises, fairs, markets, mills, and\r\nservices, which they had possessed therein from time immemorial, and\r\npraying his consent to dispose of them. In January, 1440, as bishop and\r\npatron, he directed a commission to the archdeacon of Totnes to hold an\r\ninquisition, and to report to him the verdict of the jury. Accordingly,\r\na public inquisition was held in the nave of the priory church of\r\nPlympton, on the 7th of January, the gates of the monastery, and the\r\ndoors of the church, being thrown wide open for all comers to enter.\r\nThat was a memorable day for the young town; and no doubt many\r\nPlymouthians flocked to the priory, anxious to know the award. The jury\r\nbeing sworn, found that the premises of the priory, within Sutton-Prior,\r\nhad in part been burnt by a hostile descent from Brittany; that the\r\nyearly rental of the lands and tenements there was £8; of the courts,\r\nfairs, and markets, 60_s._; and the clear profit from the mills\r\nsomething more than £10 yearly; that the offer by the mayor and\r\ncorporation of the yearly fixed pension of £41 for the premises\r\naforesaid was deemed by the prior and convent a satisfactory\r\ncompensation, and that they were willing to accept the same; and the\r\njury concurred in recommending such alienation and sale on such terms.\r\n\r\nThe parish church of St. Andrew, in Plymouth, continued an appendage to\r\nthe priory nearly until the dissolution of the house. Its perpetual\r\nvicar, William de Wolley, became a professed religious at Plympton; and\r\non resigning this benefice, the prior and convent granted, November\r\n23rd, 1334, to Bishop Grandisson, the nomination of an incumbent,\r\nsaving, however, their yearly pension of sixty marks. The bishop\r\nnominated Nicholas de Weyland, a canon of Plympton, December 23rd.\r\n\r\nThe chapel of St. Katherine on the How also belonged to the priory; but\r\nthe following list of chapels appendant to this house will give some\r\nidea of the immense patronage which it enjoyed:—SS. Mary and Thomas,\r\nPlympton, Brixton, Wembury, Plymstock, Saundford-Spiney, Egg Buckland,\r\nLanhorn (or Lanherne), Tamerton, Maristowe, Thrushelton, Uggeburgh,\r\nExminster, Islington, Newton, Stoke-in-Teignhead, Blackhauton, Bratton,\r\nMeavy, St. Just, Petertavy, etc.; and the tithes of these places were\r\nappropriated to the priory for the promotion of hospitality and charity.\r\n\r\nTwo subordinate priories or cells depended on Plympton priory—St. Mary\r\nde Marisco, commonly called Marsh Barton, in Alphington parish, and the\r\ncell of St. Anthony in the deanery of Powder, in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nMost of the churches appendant to the Plympton priory have the parvise\r\nover the south porch, as at both the Plympton churches and at Ugborough.\r\nHere were probably deposited books written by the monks in their hours\r\nof study—missals with rich borders, as well as writings of a more\r\nsecular character; and possibly the preaching monks tarried in these\r\nchambers between the hours of divine service.\r\n\r\nDr. Oliver gives the names of thirty Priors of Plympton, from Ralph, the\r\nfirst prior, to John How, the last, who subscribed to the King’s\r\nsupremacy in 1534. During the administration of some of the priors, the\r\nhospitality of the establishment seems to have been unbounded. In\r\nconsequence of the great confluence of the nobility and their retinues\r\nto the priory, the house became overcharged with debt, and Bishop\r\nOldham, after his first visitation of the house, in 1505, authorized the\r\nprior, David Bercle,[8] to retire to a distant cell until a new system\r\nof economy could be arranged.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  There is a quaint letter extant of this hospitable prior, which Dr.\r\n  Oliver gives. It is—\r\n\r\n  “To his rev’ende broders in Criste, Maister Dene and Maister Chaunter,\r\n  of Excester, or on’ of theym, this to be delyvd. in goodely haste.\r\n  Right rev’end broders in Criste, in my most lovynge maner y recomaunde\r\n  me unto yow p’ynge yow right hartely to be good maisters to a prieste\r\n  called I. David Neyton, a lovyer of myn’ which trustyth by your favors\r\n  to be on’ of your vicaryyes in Synte Peters Churche if he be a person’\r\n  necessary to occupye a such rome yn your’ sayde churche y p’y yow that\r\n  he may the rader for my desyre be accepte to the same rome, and he and\r\n  y shall p’y for the longe contynuance of your bothe prosperyteis,\r\n  which God p’sve to his pleasur’ and your hartes desyres—Amen. Writyn\r\n  in haste penultimo die Aprilis by your olde louyer and bedman’.\r\n\r\n                                        “DAVID, Prior of Plympton’.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe refectory was by no means an unimportant portion of the priory. It\r\nand the cellar under (which was in charge of a much-envied functionary,\r\nknown as the cellarer) are the only considerable remains existing of the\r\nonce extensive monastic buildings at Plympton. Here the monks, according\r\nto the seasons, had their one meal or two meals a day; the usual\r\nallowance being “one white loaf, another loaf called Trequarter, a dish\r\ncalled General, another dish of flesh or fish called Pitance, three\r\npotells of beer daily, or three silver halfpence” for the teetotalers.\r\nThis is said to have been the ordinary bill of fare, but it was, no\r\ndoubt, amplified to any extent when the lords and squires were\r\nentertained by the prior, and especially when, as in 1348, Edward the\r\nBlack Prince dined at his hospitable table.\r\n\r\nBut the time was coming when there would be “no more cakes and ale”—when\r\nthe prior and brethren would leave the monastery gates, never again to\r\nre-enter them; when, with their “occupation gone” (like the stage\r\ncoachmen and guards of the nineteenth century), they would be lost in\r\nthe crowd of a bustling world, and never seen or heard of more. There\r\nwas a dark side to the picture which England then presented; and perhaps\r\nthe saddest sight was when, on the morrow after the dissolution, the\r\nmendicant knocked at the almonry door, knowing no change, and least of\r\nall in charity, and for the first time found no bread or alms for him.\r\n\r\nThe priory remains, though little known, are of considerable interest.\r\nBesides the Norman cellar, and the Early English refectory over, there\r\nare some scattered remains of the chapel and cloisters. The cellar is\r\nsixty-one feet six inches by fourteen feet within, stone-arched, and\r\nlighted on the south side by four small semi-circular-headed windows.\r\nThe masonry is of great thickness; and on the north side and east end,\r\nin the width of the wall, is a passage two feet six inches wide, which\r\nprobably was nothing more than a dry area, though the common notion is\r\nthat it is the commencement of a subterranean way (now blocked up)\r\nleading to the castle, about a quarter of a mile distant. The original\r\nentrance to the cellar was by a fine Norman doorway on the south side.\r\nIt was only after diligent search that I found it, encased with many\r\ncoats of plaster. There are engaged shafts on each side, and the chevron\r\nornament is carried round the jambs as well as the arch, which latter is\r\nformed of alternate voussoirs of grey and green stone.\r\n\r\nAbove the cellar is the almost perfect outline of the refectory, with\r\nits original fire-place, windows, and roof, all of an Early English\r\ncharacter. The kitchen, a detached building of the fifteenth century,\r\nsituated to the east of the refectory, remains in a tolerably perfect\r\nstate, and the position of the old priory mill is indicated by a modern\r\nstructure erected about seventy years ago.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the mill is the priory orchard, said to be the oldest in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAt some distance to the north-west of the domestic buildings were the\r\nchapel and cloisters, of which some vestiges remain in their original\r\npositions, but around them modern walls and hedges have been formed. The\r\nbases of a doorway, deeply recessed, having four detached shafts on each\r\nside, and beautifully moulded, lead to the supposition that the Priory\r\nas a whole was a most important architectural work. I also found several\r\nscattered fragments of Early English foliage. No doubt many interesting\r\nobjects lie buried in the priory lands, and possibly even the tombs of\r\nthe two bishops Warelwast.\r\n\r\nIn the Norman and Early English and Decorated work about here we find\r\nthat granite was never used, although to be obtained in the immediate\r\nlocality.[9] It was probably rejected, not merely because it was hard to\r\nwork, but on account of its cold and colourless appearance. Thus, in the\r\nPriory and in the most ancient portions of the two churches, _i.e._, the\r\nchancels, you will find no dressings or moulded work in that material,\r\nbut in the beautiful and durable green slate-stone from St. Germans or\r\nBoringdon, and in Caen stone; and to give still more artistic effect to\r\ntheir buildings, they used sparingly a close red sandstone, obtained\r\nfrom a distance. There are some rather old-looking houses in Plympton,\r\nwhich are said to be built entirely of stone from the priory, and in one\r\nfront in particular may be observed this beautiful masonry of the\r\nthirteenth century, in green and red, arranged almost like a draught\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  This also applies to the Cornish churches.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe Perpendicular builders were not, as a rule, remarkable for artistic\r\nfeeling. They saw beauty in size, uniformity, and in the endless\r\nrepetition of a stereotyped panel; and one can imagine archæologists of\r\nthe fifteenth century regarding contemporary architects much as we look\r\nupon the designers of the glass and iron palaces of the present day. The\r\ngreater part of the churches of Plympton St. Mary and Plympton St.\r\nMaurice are Perpendicular and built of granite, in large blocks, and\r\nthere is not that sharp and elegant detail in this as in the earlier\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nSt. Mary’s is a pretty and picturesque church now; but it was probably\r\nmore than two hundred years before the granite began to tone down, and\r\nthe ivy and lichen to cling to it—neither, as a rule, “take kindly,” as\r\nthe saying is in Devonshire, to granite.\r\n\r\nThe limits of this paper will not allow of my giving anything like a\r\ndetailed description of Plympton St. Mary Church. Full justice has\r\nalready been done this edifice by the late Rev. W. I. Coppard, who was\r\nlargely instrumental in its being restored. The Early Decorated\r\nchancel—with its fine east window and elaborate sedilia and piscina—is\r\none of the best specimens of the period in the county. Not the least\r\ninteresting part of the church is the south porch and parvise over,\r\nwhich the late Mr. H. H. Treby took most commendable pains to restore.\r\nThe groining of the porch is admirable, though in the re-dressing and\r\nchiselling of the ribs and bosses the original character of the work has\r\nbeen partially impaired. In restorations, much is lost through the\r\ndesire to see things look fresh and new.\r\n\r\nIn the Strode, or St. Catherine chapel, is the monument of Sir William\r\nStrode, with the effigies of the knight and his two wives:—\r\n\r\n            Mary, incarnate virtue, soul and skin\r\n            Both pure, whom death nor life convinced of sin,\r\n            Had daughters like 7 Pleiades, but she\r\n            Was a prime star of greatest charity.\r\n\r\nAnd over the knight:—\r\n\r\n            Treade soft, for if you wake this knight alone,\r\n            You raise an host, religion’s champion,\r\n            His country’s staff, right bold distributor,\r\n            His neighbour’s guard, the poor man’s almoner,\r\n            Who dies with works about him as he did,\r\n            Shall rise attended most triumphantly.\r\n\r\nThe Town Church of Plympton, originally dedicated to Thomas à Becket,\r\nbut, when rebuilt in the fifteenth century, to St. Maurice, consists of\r\na nave, north and south aisles, and a fine tower at the west end, in the\r\nPerpendicular style of the fifteenth century, and a chancel, as at St.\r\nMary’s, of an earlier date, having an interesting sedilia and good\r\ndecorated window at the east end—speaking of the masonry, and not of the\r\nglass, which is extremely bad. The south porch has a vaulted roof and\r\nparvise over, as at the other church.\r\n\r\nMuch has been done of late years towards improving this parish church,\r\nbut its internal effect is entirely marred by the unsightly plastered\r\nroof of the nave, and the close pews or pens. The nave-roof, I find by\r\nreference to the vestry book, was re-constructed in the year 1752, after\r\nthe model of the new roof in Stoke Damerel Church, then recently put up.\r\nThat was the dark age of English taste. How very dark may be imagined\r\nfrom this plagiarism.\r\n\r\nThere are memorial windows in this church to members of the Treby\r\nfamily, and monuments to the Rev. Samuel Reynolds, Admiral Cotton, and\r\nother local celebrities. The following epitaph is the most curious:—\r\n\r\n                         Saml. Snelling, Gent.\r\n                           Twise Maior of this\r\n                         town, he died the 20\r\n                           Day of Nov. 1624.\r\n\r\n                         The man whose body\r\n                         That here doth lye\r\n                         Beganne to live\r\n                         When he did dye.\r\n\r\n                         Good faith in life\r\n                         And death he proved,\r\n                         And was of God\r\n                         And man belov’d;\r\n\r\n                         Now he liveth\r\n                         In Heaven’s joy,\r\n                         And never more\r\n                         To feel annoy.\r\n\r\nThe shaft of a large granite cross, probably the market cross, was\r\ndiscovered about forty-two years ago embedded in a wall of the\r\nGuildhall, taken down in the course of some alterations.\r\n\r\nIn the register of this parish are some curious entries. Thus, there is\r\nrecord of a plague which carried off a great number of the inhabitants;\r\nand on one occasion forty marriages are said to have taken place in one\r\nday, by proclamation, at the Market Cross. This was during the\r\nCommonwealth, when the religious ceremony was ignored, and against the\r\nentry some stout Royalist or disappointed bachelor has written: “This\r\nwas the hour and power of darkness.”\r\n\r\nWe have yet to touch on the politics of the town.\r\n\r\nPlympton became a borough town, with the privileges of a market and\r\nfairs, by a charter from Baldwin de Redvers, Earl of Devon, dated March\r\n25th, 1241. The borough sent members to Parliament as early as the\r\ntwenty-third year of Edward I.’s reign, and continued to do so until\r\ndisfranchised in 1832. It was a very respectable constituency of nearly\r\na hundred free burgesses, who were sworn in by the corporation, which\r\nconsisted of a mayor, recorder, and eight aldermen, called the Common\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nThe Strode influence was great in the town from a very early time, and\r\nseveral members of that family sat in Parliament for Plympton. In\r\nElizabeth’s reign, Sir John Hele, a distinguished lawyer, and at one\r\ntime King’s Sergeant, was returned for the borough. A little later, Sir\r\nFrancis Drake, nephew of the great Sir Francis, and successor to the\r\nbaronetcy, became member. In Charles I.’s reign, Sir William Strode, one\r\nof the most distinguished of the great party which then resisted the\r\nundue authority of the Crown, and who, with three other members, was\r\ncommitted to the tower by the King, sat in Parliament for Plympton.\r\nAnother famous member for Plympton was Sir Nicholas Slanning, a staunch\r\nRoyalist, who distinguished himself, especially, as a brave soldier in\r\nthe siege of Bristol. Then we have the memorable names of Sir George\r\nTreby (ancestor of the late Mr. H. H. Treby) and Sir John Maynard, and\r\nat quite a late period in the history of this borough, Lord Castlereagh\r\nrepresented it in Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn an interesting address delivered by the last recorder of the town,\r\nMr. Deeble Boger, on the occasion of the corporation resigning their\r\nfunctions in 1859, it was stated that the borough was “what was called a\r\nnomination borough, that is, those two families who had the greatest\r\nnumber of friends, and to whom, from the period of the revolution, the\r\ngratitude of the borough was justly due—the Trebys, in whom great\r\ninterest naturally centred, and the Edgcumbes, who were connected with\r\nthe borough in the same way—possessed the power of nominating a member,\r\nand this nomination consisted in their recommending him for election.\r\nThis power was subject to one limitation, that the person recommended\r\nshould be of the same politics as the electors.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest representative the borough ever had was Sir\r\nChristopher Wren. It was in May, 1685, that this distinguished architect\r\nwas elected Member of Parliament for Plympton. How this came to pass,\r\nand which of the two great parties he represented, we are not precisely\r\ninformed, but may easily conjecture, as Plympton was always a Tory\r\nborough. No doubt he occasionally thought, though he might not say, with\r\nMercutio, “A plague on both your houses,” for men of science and\r\nartists—and he was in a high degree an artist—are seldom very ardent\r\npoliticians. Still, we know he was a staunch Royalist and Churchman. His\r\nfather was Dean of Windsor; his uncle, the Bishop of Ely, had been\r\nimprisoned in the Tower for nearly twenty years during the Commonwealth;\r\nhe himself was a Fellow of All Souls’, Oxford, and held a professorship\r\nat that University, at an extremely orthodox period. There are other\r\nreasons for supposing that he stuck pretty close to the court and\r\ngovernment of the day. His father being Dean, and Sir Christopher\r\nhimself having only the year before been appointed Comptroller of the\r\nWorks at Windsor, we may readily imagine that he came down to the\r\nindependent electors of Plympton with a rather strong recommendation\r\nfrom the Dean and Chapter, who were, as they are still, the patrons of\r\nthe living in this borough. And when he came (always supposing that he\r\ndid come, and that he did not merely send his respects from London), he\r\nwas, no doubt, well entertained by the gentlemen of his party in the\r\ntown, and lustily cheered by the agricultural non-electors, who always\r\nexhibited a great deal of enthusiasm under the stimulating influence of\r\nan election, and were never heard again to express their sentiments\r\nuntil the next parliament brought down a new member for the eyes of all\r\nPlympton—not to say “all Europe”—to gaze upon. Many of the inhabitants,\r\nhowever, who were acquainted with Sir Christopher’s fame, may be\r\nsupposed to have regarded their representative with admiration and\r\npride. Just nineteen years before, the terrible Fire had devastated the\r\nmetropolis, and now London was rising like a phœnix from the ashes by\r\nhis magic wand. Exactly ten years before he had himself laid the\r\nfoundation stone of St. Paul’s Cathedral, and now the first stage of\r\nthat great work had been just completed, the choir and its side aisles,\r\nand critics, who remembered old St. Paul’s in its Gothic glory, and had\r\nseen Inigo Jones defacing and tinkering the venerable fane with his\r\nPalladian porticoes and urns, were flocking to the churchyard. The new\r\nstructure was already too grand and unique not to be commended; but\r\nthere was yet a quarter of a century’s laborious and incessant work\r\nbefore the top stone could be raised, and the gilded cross could crown\r\nthe noble dome. The same architect, the same master-builder, and the\r\nsame bishop, who witnessed the beginning of the great work in 1675, saw\r\nits close in 1710.\r\n\r\nSir Christopher Wren, the member for Plympton, was probably the first\r\narchitect ever returned to the House of Commons. There have been several\r\nsince then, and their presence in Parliament has no doubt tended to\r\nadvance public taste, and to further many great and important national\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nThe Guildhall was built or, rather, restored in 1696, some years after\r\nSir Christopher Wren represented the town, and it may be safely asserted\r\nthat he had no hand in designing the present elevation, because, quaint\r\nand picturesque though it is, his style is nowhere stamped on it. It is,\r\nhowever, said (with what truth I cannot say) that he was the architect\r\nof Plympton House, a large and substantial mansion, with a façade of\r\nPortland stone, erected in the reign of Queen Anne for Mr. Commissioner\r\nOurry, of Plymouth Dockyard. It is a plain but costly building, in the\r\nthen newly-adopted style, with a certain French character about it. The\r\nlarge and broad barred sash windows, with their weights and pulleys,\r\nwhich were novelties at that time, must have greatly puzzled Snug, the\r\njoiner of Plympton, who had been accustomed all his days to the old\r\nEnglish casements.\r\n\r\nThe Guildhall has more of the mediæval character about it, with its\r\npillars and arches and covered way, like the Chester Rows, and probably\r\nit was intended to have some resemblance to the Guildhall in the county\r\ntown—a humble but by no means unsuccessful imitation. Thus we follow\r\nsuit in buildings as in everything else, though the architecture of our\r\ntowns would, no doubt, be more entertaining if we oftener aimed at\r\noriginality, and played a card of our own occasionally.[10]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Over the Guildhall are the arms, carved in stone, of Sir Thomas\r\n  Trevor, Knight, and Sir George Treby, Knight. Members of the Treby\r\n  family were often connected with the corporation of the borough. In\r\n  1755 the parishioners at a vestry then held passed a resolution\r\n  concerning the ringing of the church bells, “George Treby, Esq., and\r\n  the other gentlemen belonging to the corporation,” being respectfully\r\n  included in the said resolution.\r\n\r\n  “Agreed on Easter Monday, March the 31st day, 1755, by us whose names\r\n  are hereunto subscribed, being the Parishioners then present at the\r\n  Vestry then held. That only five persons shall, and are by the\r\n  authority of the said Vestry allowed to ring the Bells of this Parish\r\n  for the future, and that they shall ring only on such public days as\r\n  the Parishioners shall from time to time agree to and approve of, and\r\n  that the said five persons that shall undertake to Ring shall be\r\n  obliged likewise to chime the Bells on every Sunday in the forenoon\r\n  and the afternoon, at the proper season for Divine Service, and that\r\n  they shall be obliged to give their due and regular attendance, both\r\n  in the fore and afternoon of every Sunday upon the Service of the\r\n  church, and that they be at Liberty to ring for George Treby, Esq.,\r\n  and the other Gentlemen belonging to the Corporation, as often as the\r\n  said Gentlemen shall signify it to be their pleasure to have the Bells\r\n  rung, and that the said Ringers are never to ring after _Eight_ of the\r\n  clock in the Evening, or before Seven in the morning.”\r\n\r\n  “The Ringers are never to ring after Eight.” Thus are old customs and\r\n  traditions handed down from age to age.\r\n\r\n               “The Curfew tolls the knell of parting day.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSpeaking of cards reminds me that in the same street with the Guildhall\r\nare some curious old slated fronts, in which the slates have been cut in\r\nthe shape of clubs, spades, hearts, and diamonds. Under these fronts we\r\nhave also the covered way.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a building a little to the south-east of the church,\r\naround which so many treasured associations cluster, that we hardly know\r\nwhether we have yet said adieu to the sacred edifices of Plympton. The\r\nold Grammar School is the most venerable and interesting school of art\r\nin all England. Here the greatest English painter—a man for “all\r\ntime”—learnt the first principles of drawing. The house in which he was\r\nborn overlooks his schoolroom and his playground. Here, too, Northcote,\r\nhis clever and eccentric pupil, acquired his, perhaps not very classic,\r\neducation. This, also, was the first school of the late distinguished\r\nPresident of the Royal Academy, Sir Charles Eastlake, and the _Alma\r\nMater_ of poor Benjamin Haydon. A mournful interest, indeed, attaches to\r\nthe building as connected with the last-mentioned name. The year before\r\nhe died Haydon visited the old Grammar School, and wrote his name in\r\npencil on the wall, where you may still see it:—\r\n\r\n                     B. R. Haydon,\r\n                       Historical Painter, London,\r\n                         Educated here 1801.\r\n                     Rev. W. Haines (Master).\r\n                       Head Boy then.\r\n\r\nThis was only a few months before a dark and impenetrable cloud shrouded\r\nthe clear intellect of this gifted man, and his life—so useful, but so\r\nill-requited—closed in saddest gloom.\r\n\r\nThe key-stone of the doorway under the cloister gives the date of the\r\nbuilding as 1664. Strange to say, it is a Gothic structure of the most\r\npicturesque design and arrangement. At the time it was built,\r\narchitecture had been given over almost entirely to the Renaissance and\r\nItalian schools. It is singular, therefore, to find here at Plympton an\r\nunconventional style adopted at such a time, but it has been suggested\r\nthat the same eccentric architect who designed the fine Gothic church of\r\nCharles in Plymouth in the middle of the seventeenth century built also\r\nthe Grammar School in the neighbouring town, and the points of\r\nresemblance are certainly very great. We have the same evidence of the\r\ndesire to do something good and true in both—the same good outline and\r\narrangement of parts, and the same superadded faults in little details,\r\nas though the designer himself knew what he was about, but could not\r\nbring his workmen up to the mark. No wonder little Reynolds saw\r\nsomething to admire in the outline and shadows of the cloisters, for\r\nnothing can be better than the proportions of the pillars and arches,\r\nand the banding of the masonry over in alternate courses about six\r\ninches high, of granite and dark limestone. In fact, the lower portion\r\nof the building is the most pleasing piece of masonry in this\r\nneighbourhood; and though the large square-headed windows over are not\r\nso good, yet the angle of the roof is excellent, and the large\r\nPerpendicular windows at the ends not without merit. The schoolroom is\r\nabout sixty-three feet long by twenty-six feet in width, the master’s\r\ndesk at one end, and on each side of the window (over) a rudely-painted\r\nshield, with the armorial bearings of Hele and Maynard. Overhanging the\r\nentrance on one side is a small gallery, approached from a chamber\r\nprobably once used as a class or flogging room, but now too dilapidated\r\nfor either practical purpose, and much in keeping with the rest of the\r\nbuilding, which is rather out at elbows. In fact—what with the Castle,\r\nPriory, and Grammar School—the description which the American gave of\r\nRome will apply to Plympton—“_Quite_ a nice place, but the public\r\nbuildings very much out of repair.” The Master’s house adjoins the\r\nschool-room, and here the great painter was born. The front appears to\r\nbe comparatively modern, but the bedroom in which he is said to have\r\nfirst seen the light is in the back and older part of the house, with a\r\nwindow overlooking the school and playground, as before mentioned. Some\r\nrough sketches, drawn by Reynolds in his youth, were to be seen on the\r\nwalls of this room when Haydon and Wilkie visited the house in 1809, but\r\nhave since been obliterated by some barbarous whitewasher. The engraving\r\nrepresents the cloisters of the Grammar School, the subject of almost\r\nthe first drawing Reynolds ever made.\r\n\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds was born on the 16th July, 1723, and was baptized on\r\nthe 30th of the same month, when, by mistake, his name was entered in\r\nthe register as Joseph.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary here to give anything like a sketch of the great\r\npainter’s career, but one or two incidents connected with the place of\r\nhis birth (to which throughout his life he was strongly attached) may be\r\nmentioned. He regarded with the greatest satisfaction and pleasure his\r\nvisit to Devonshire with Dr. Johnson in 1762. It was on this occasion\r\nthat Northcote first saw his great master. It seems that Sir Joshua went\r\nto Plymouth Dock, in company with the Doctor, on a certain day when\r\nthere was a great commotion in reference to some local matter, probably\r\nthe water question. “I remember,” says Northcote, “when he was pointed\r\nout to me at a public meeting, where a great crowd was assembled, I got\r\nas near to him as I could from the pressure of the people, to touch the\r\nskirt of his coat, which I did with great satisfaction to my mind.”\r\n\r\nIn 1772, Sir Joshua was elected to the Aldermanic gown of Plympton, Lord\r\nMount Edgcumbe acquainting him by letter of the circumstance. The letter\r\nin which he acknowledges the honour, with most hearty thanks, is in the\r\nCottonian Museum at Plymouth. In the following year he was chosen Mayor\r\nof the borough, and he declared that this circumstance gave him more\r\ngratification than any other honour which he had received during his\r\nlife; and this sentiment he expressed when it was rather out of place,\r\nas the following circumstance related by Northcote will shew. Reynolds\r\nhad built for his recreation on Richmond Hill a villa, of which Sir\r\nWilliam Chambers was architect, and in the summer season it was the\r\nfrequent custom of Sir Joshua to dine at this place with select parties\r\nof his friends. “It happened some little time before he was to be\r\nelected Mayor of Plympton that, one day, after dining at the house,\r\nhimself and his party took an evening walk in Richmond Gardens, when,\r\nvery unexpectedly, at a turning of one of the avenues, they suddenly met\r\nthe King, accompanied by a part of the Royal Family; and when, as his\r\nMajesty saw him, it was impossible for him to withdraw without being\r\nnoticed. The King called to him, and immediately entered into\r\nconversation, and told him that he had been informed of the office that\r\nhe was soon to be invested with—that of being made the Mayor of his\r\nnative town of Plympton. Sir Joshua was astonished that so minute and\r\ninconsiderable a circumstance, which was of importance only to himself,\r\nshould have come so quickly to the knowledge of the King; but he assured\r\nhis Majesty of its truth, saying it was an honour which gave him more\r\npleasure than any other he had ever received in his life; and then,\r\nluckily recollecting himself, added, ‘except that which your Majesty was\r\ngraciously pleased to bestow upon me,’ alluding to his knighthood.”\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of his being elected Mayor, he presented to his\r\nmuch-loved native town his own portrait, painted, as it seems, expressly\r\nto commemorate the occasion. It was placed in the Corporation\r\ndining-room, but sold by the Common Council for £150 when the town was\r\ndisfranchised! That _this_ was “the hour and power of darkness” there\r\ncannot be a doubt.\r\n\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds died on the 23rd February, 1792, and was interred in\r\nthe crypt of St. Paul’s Cathedral with every honour that could be shewn\r\nto worth and genius. His tomb, adorned by one of Flaxman’s best works,\r\nis almost close to that of Sir Christopher Wren—England’s greatest\r\npainter, we may almost say without any qualification, and England’s\r\ngreatest architect—each, during some portion of life connected with this\r\nhonoured little town of Plympton, though by different ties and at\r\ndifferent periods of its history; both resting from their labours in the\r\ngreat temple which Wren built, and which Reynolds sought to adorn with\r\nhis matchless pencil.\r\n\r\nThe great honour which belongs to Plympton deserves to be held in\r\nlasting remembrance, not merely by every inhabitant of that town, but by\r\nall who have any appreciation of art or desire for its advancement.\r\n\r\n                                                         JAMES HINE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: leaf]\r\n\r\n  NOTE.—The authorities for the historical facts in this paper are Dr.\r\n  Oliver, Rev.

Prout, Jun._]     [_Engraved by Neele._\r\n                  THE “WAR PRISON” ON DARTMOOR, 1807.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     FRENCH PRISONERS ON DARTMOOR.\r\n\r\n                           BY J. D. PRICKMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century Mr. Thomas, afterwards Sir\r\nThomas Tyrwhitt, who held the office of Lord Warden of the Stannaries\r\nunder the then Prince of Wales, afterwards George IV., originated the\r\nidea of building a prison on Dartmoor for the numerous prisoners of war\r\nthen in Great Britain, who were at that time mostly confined in hulks\r\nand military and naval prisons. The Government of that day took up the\r\nidea, and, adopting the plans of Mr. Daniel Alexander, proceeded to\r\ncarry them out, the first stone of the prison being laid by Sir Thomas\r\nTyrwhitt on the 20th March, 1806.\r\n\r\nThe site of the prison—about seven miles east of Tavistock and about\r\nfifteen (straight across the moor) south of Okehampton—was granted by\r\nthe Prince of Wales, as Duke of Cornwall and Lord of the Forest of\r\nDartmoor.\r\n\r\nThe building as then built is described in the Notes to Risdon’s\r\n_Devonshire,_ published in 1811, as follows:—\r\n\r\n  The outer wall encloses a circle of about 30 acres—within this is\r\n  another wall which encloses the area in which the Prison stands—this\r\n  area is a smaller circle with a segment cut off. The prisons are 5\r\n  large rectangular buildings each capable of containing more than 1,500\r\n  men; they have each two floors, where is arranged a double tier of\r\n  Hammocks slung on cast-iron pillars, and a third floor in the roof,\r\n  which is used as a promenade in wet weather. There are besides two\r\n  other spacious buildings, one of which is a large hospital, and the\r\n  other is appropriated to the Petty Officers. The entrance is on the\r\n  western side, the gateway, built of solid blocks of granite, bearing\r\n  the inscription, “Parcere subjectis.”\r\n\r\nThe total cost of the work was nearly £130,000, and it was completed\r\nsomewhere about the year 1809, and the collection of houses gradually\r\nformed what is now known as Princetown.\r\n\r\nThe first set of prisoners was sent there on the 29th May, 1809, and the\r\nbuildings continued to be used as a war prison from then until the 22nd\r\nApril, 1814, during which time no less than 12,679 prisoners underwent\r\nconfinement there. During the years 1809, 1810 and 1811, deaths at the\r\nprison were very numerous from one cause and another, so much so, that a\r\nReturn was asked for in the House of Commons, by which it appears that\r\nfrom May, 1809, to June, 1811, no less than 622 prisoners died.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of such Returns:—\r\n\r\n                1809.

The total number of deaths during the whole time the\r\nbuildings were used as a war prison was 1,117; of these 1,095 were\r\nFrench, and 22 American, prisoners.\r\n\r\nOf the life of the prisoners inside the prison little is known. We know\r\nthat Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt procured the privilege of holding a market and\r\na fair at Princetown, and that daily markets were held within the\r\nprecincts of the prison for the sale by the country people of\r\nvegetables, etc., to the prisoners. There are rumours that the prisoners\r\ngambled away their clothing and rations; but their life as prisoners on\r\nDartmoor must have been infinitely preferable to that endured by those\r\nwho were previous thereto confined in hulks and transports; but the\r\ndetails of the life are wanting, and even the pamphlet written by Capt.\r\nVernon Harris, for many years Governor of Dartmoor Prison after it was\r\nre-opened, gives no great information on the subject. Many writers of\r\nfiction have founded romances on the prison and the prisoners, but for\r\nthe most part on imagination. Probably the best of the kind, and most\r\naccurate in detail, is _The Queen of the Moor_, by the Rev. Frederick\r\nAdye, who was for many years resident in the district, and therefore\r\nwell acquainted with the surrounding country and the rumours of the\r\nneighbourhood. Monsieur Jules Poulain, a Frenchman who is said to have\r\nlived at Princetown to be near a friend who was confined there, has\r\nwritten in the French language an interesting book entitled _Dartmoor,\r\nor the Two Sisters_. He, in describing Dartmoor, says:—“Think of the\r\nocean waves changed into granite during a tempestuous storm, and you\r\nwill then form an idea of what Dartmoor is like,” which indeed gives\r\nrather a vivid picture of the rolling hills and valleys.\r\n\r\nMany of the prisoners of war were allowed out on parole. From Capt.\r\nVernon Harris’ interesting pamphlet we learn the form of parole was as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  Whereas the Commissioners for conducting His Majesty’s Transport\r\n  service and for the care and custody of French officers and sailors\r\n  detained in England have been pleased to grant A. B. leave to reside\r\n  in .... upon condition that he gives his parole of honour not to\r\n  withdraw one mile from the boundaries prescribed there without leave\r\n  for that purpose from the said Commissioners, that he will behave\r\n  himself decently and with due regard to the laws of the Kingdom, and\r\n  also that he will not directly or indirectly hold any correspondence\r\n  with France during his continuance in England, but by such letter or\r\n  letters as shall be shewn to the Agent of the said Commissioners under\r\n  whose care he is or may be in order to their being read and approved\r\n  by the superiors. He does hereby declare that he having given his\r\n  parole of honour will keep it inviolably.\r\n\r\n                                                         (Signature)\r\n\r\nThe following towns in Devon and Cornwall were set aside for prisoners\r\non parole:—Ashburton, Okehampton, Moretonhampstead, Tavistock, Bodmin,\r\nLaunceston, Callington, Roscoe and Regilliack, but probably prisoners\r\nwere from time to time billetted in other towns such as Tiverton\r\n(mentioned later) and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe following notice was sent and posted as notice to the inhabitants of\r\nthe town selected for residence of the prisoners allowed out on parole:—\r\n\r\n                         NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN,\r\n\r\n  That all such prisoners are permitted to walk or ride on the Great\r\n  Turnpike Road within the distance of one mile from the extreme parts\r\n  of the Town (not beyond the bounds of the Parish) and that if they\r\n  shall exceed such limits or go into any field or cross road they may\r\n  be taken up and sent to prison and a reward of 10s. will be paid by\r\n  the Agent for apprehending them. And further that such prisoners are\r\n  to be in their lodgings by 5 o’clock in the winter and 8 o’clock in\r\n  the summer months and if they stay out later they are liable to be\r\n  taken up and sent to the Agent for such misconduct. And to prevent the\r\n  prisoners from behaving in an improper manner to the inhabitants of\r\n  the town or creating any riots or disturbances either with them or\r\n  among themselves notice is also given that the Commissioners will\r\n  cause upon information being given to their agent any prisoner who\r\n  shall so misbehave to be committed to prison. And such of the\r\n  inhabitants who shall insult or abuse any of the prisoners of war on\r\n  parole or shall be found in any respect aiding or assisting in the\r\n  escape of such prisoners will be prosecuted according to law.\r\n\r\nIn reference to Tavistock, the Prison Commissioners reported that there\r\nwere 150 prisoners there allowed out on parole, and that their conduct\r\nwas exemplary. The Report further stated—\r\n\r\n  Some of them have made overtures of marriage to women in the\r\n  neighbourhood which the magistrates have very properly taken pains to\r\n  discourage.\r\n\r\nWhen allowed out on parole the prisoner was assigned to some place of\r\nresidence, after which he received a fixed sum for his maintenance, and\r\nwas permitted to engage in any kind of business or occupation, and to\r\nuse any additional funds he might possess. Many of the prisoners\r\noccupied their time in teaching languages, and in carving various things\r\nsuch as chessmen, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are instances of attempts by the prisoners on parole to escape. At\r\nthe Devon Summer Assize, 1812, Richard Tapper, described as of\r\nMoretonhampstead, Carrier, Thomas Vinnacombe and William Vinnacombe (his\r\nbrother) of Cheriton Bishop, described in the indictments as Smugglers\r\n(a curious and, one would have thought, a somewhat prejudiced\r\ndescription of their occupation), were indicted and convicted of\r\nmisdemeanour for aiding and assisting, with divers other persons\r\nunknown, Casimer Baudouin, an officer in the French Navy; Allain Michel\r\nand Louis Hamel, Captains of Merchant Vessels; Pierre Joseph Dennis, a\r\nSecond Captain of a Privateer; and Andrew Fleuriot, a Midshipman of the\r\nFrench Navy, to escape from Moretonhampstead. The French prisoners paid\r\n£25 down, and subsequently £150 for the assistance rendered. They were\r\ntaken on horseback to Topsham, and placed in a large boat described as\r\neighteen feet long, but in going down the estuary of the Exe, however,\r\nnot far from Exmouth, the boat grounded on the Bar, and they were\r\napprehended. The story is somewhat graphically, though at considerable\r\nlength, told in the records of the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe French prisoners formed no less than twenty-six Lodges and Chapters\r\nof Freemasons in England and elsewhere. The only one in the\r\nneighbourhood of Dartmoor was at Ashburton, and the only evidence of it\r\nis an undated certificate granted to one Paul Carcenac, described as\r\nAssistant Commissary, the Lodge being described as “Des Amis Reunis”\r\n(the Re-united Friends). A copy of the certificate and many further\r\ninteresting details concerning this and other Lodges, notably those at\r\nAbergavenny, “Enfants de Mars et de Neptune”; at Plymouth “Amis Reunis”;\r\nat Tiverton, “Enfants de Mars” (see Bro. Sharland’s _Freemasonry in\r\nTiverton_, published in 1899), are given in a most interesting book by\r\nBro. John T. Thorp entitled _French Prisoners’ Lodges_, published in\r\n1900, and printed at Leicester by Bro. George Gibbons, King Street.\r\n\r\nThere appear to be but few records of the prisoners at the various\r\ntowns, and only the vaguest reminiscences. In Okehampton it is said that\r\nthere were about 150 prisoners on parole. In the Churchyard is a\r\ntombstone—a rough slate slab—on which appears the following:—\r\n\r\n                       Cette Pierre Fut\r\n                       Elevee Par\r\n                       Lamitie a La Memoire\r\n                       Darmand Bernard\r\n                       ne au Harve\r\n                       En Normande Marie a\r\n                       Calais a Mad^{cle} Margot\r\n                       11^e Officer\r\n                       De Commerce Decedee\r\n                       Prisoner de Guerre a\r\n                       Okehampton le 26 October\r\n                       1815 aged 33 ans\r\n                       A Labri des vertus\r\n                       Qui Distinguaient\r\n                       La vie\r\n                       Tu reposes en paix\r\n                       ombre tendre et cherie\r\n\r\nAnother close by bears the following inscription:—\r\n\r\n                                 C^r Cit\r\n                 Adelaide Barrin Du Puyleaune[11] De La\r\n                 Commune De Montravers Dept\r\n                 Des Deux Sevres Nee le 31 Avril\r\n                 1771 Decedee a Okehampton le 18\r\n                 Fevre 1811 Fille le Legitme Dal\r\n                 F^{are} Barrion Notaire et Procav^{re}\r\n                 De Machecoura ne de N^{re}\r\n                     Ici repose la mere & l’enfant\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Entered in the Death Register of the parish as Ann Duchane.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMany prisoners on parole died and were buried at Moretonhampstead, but\r\nthe grave-stones are not easily decipherable. The following entries of\r\nburial appear in the Register:—\r\n\r\n  Jan. 24 1811 Jean Francois Rohan French Officer on Parole. June 11\r\n  1811 Arnaud Aubry Lieutenant on Parole. Buried in Wooling (Shroud)\r\n  according to act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous French prisoners who died at Princetown no account\r\nappears in the parish register, and to quote again from Capt. Vernon\r\nHarris’ book:\r\n\r\n  Little attention appears to have been paid to the last resting-place\r\n  of these unfortunates. We read in the account published by R. Evans\r\n  that the burial place of the unfortunate captives has been sadly\r\n  neglected. Horses and cattle have broken up the soil and left the\r\n  bones of the dead to whiten in the sun.\r\n\r\nThis will be readily understood when it is remembered the prison\r\nremained unoccupied from 1816 until about the year 1850. To Capt.\r\nStopforth, who was Governor of the prison in 1865, belongs the honour of\r\ncollecting the remains of the prisoners and burying them in two separate\r\nenclosures on the northern side of the prison way from the public road,\r\nand erecting monuments which are at present existing, being granite\r\ncolumns; the one on the left or western side being the French, bears the\r\nfollowing inscription:—\r\n\r\n                      In memory of the French\r\n                      Prisoners of War who\r\n                      died in Dartmoor Prison\r\n                      between the years 1809\r\n                      and 1814 and lie buried here\r\n                          “Dulce et decorum\r\n                           est pro patriâ mori.”\r\n\r\nThe other, being the American, bears the same inscription except that\r\nthe word “French” is altered to “American.”\r\n\r\nAfter the prison was discontinued as a war prison, various schemes were\r\nstarted for utilising the buildings. The late Prince Consort visited the\r\nDuchy Estates in 1846, and the question of making use of the old prison\r\ncame under his notice. In 1850 began the formation of a Convict\r\nSettlement, and gradually the old buildings have been pulled down so\r\nthat now only one small portion, known as the French Prison, remains. As\r\na convict prison all the prisoners—and the average is about one\r\nthousand—are those who have been sentenced to penal servitude. Many are\r\nsent specially to Dartmoor for the benefit of their health, the climate,\r\nin the early stages of chest complaint, being most efficacious. Medical\r\nofficers of the prison and elsewhere have from time to time recorded\r\ntheir opinion of the great advantages which are derived by phthisical\r\npatients from residence at such an altitude above the sea-level.\r\n\r\nMuch of the information derived is from Capt. Vernon Harris’ pamphlet,\r\nRowe’s _Dartmoor_, 3rd Edition, published in 1896, and from the various\r\nreferences thereto. Some of the statistics are contained in the writer’s\r\npaper on the prison printed in the transactions of the Devonshire\r\nAssociation, 1901, xxiii. pp. 309–321.\r\n\r\n                                                     J. D. PRICKMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        OTTERY ST. MARY AND ITS\r\n                               MEMORIES.\r\n\r\n              BY THE RIGHT HON. LORD COLERIDGE, M.A., K.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the traveller passing down the Vale of Otter by rail looks out to the\r\nEast, he will see a great grey church with transeptal towers—a rare\r\nfeature—one crowned with a spire, standing on rising ground backed by a\r\ngreat continuous chine of hill. Around the church nestles a small town,\r\nand a clear, swift river hastens by it to the sea. This is the\r\nCollegiate Church of Ottery St. Mary, mainly the creation of Bishop\r\nGrandisson. Edward the Confessor gave the Manor of Ottery St. Mary in\r\n1061 to the Chapter of the Cathedral Church of Rouen, in Normandy.\r\nBishop Grandisson bought the Manor in 1335, laid the foundations of the\r\ncollege for forty secular monks, and amplified the church to suit the\r\ncollege. Bishop Bronescombe consecrated a church here in 1260. His work\r\nis seen in the nave and transepts of the present building. Bishop\r\nGrandisson built the nave, lady chapel and side chapels, etc., raised\r\nthe towers over the transepts, and covered the whole with a\r\nstone-groined roof. The church left his hands a miniature cathedral. A\r\nwealthy lady, Cicely Bonville, wife, first of the Marquis of Dorset, and\r\nthen of Henry Lord Stafford, added the north aisle—1503–1523—with its\r\ngrand fan-tracery groining, a purely indigenous feature, which may be\r\nseen repeated at Cullompton, and the whole result is a majesty and\r\nvariety of external elevation which no building of its size can well\r\nsurpass. It was the central figure of a group of buildings.\r\nChapter-house, library, cloisters, gate-house, all were there. The\r\nhouses for the dignitaries stood around. Fragments alone remain. There\r\nstill stand the vicar’s house, the warden’s house, the chanter’s house,\r\nand the manor house containing portions of old work. The houses of the\r\nminister, the sacristan, and the canons have disappeared.\r\n\r\nFrom these haunts of ancient peace there was issued, in 1509, Alexander\r\nBarclay’s _Stultifera Navis_, or _Ship of Fools_, a translation, or\r\nrather paraphrase, of the _Narrenschiff_ of Sebastian Brandt, which\r\noriginally appeared in the Swabian dialect. Barclay’s book contains much\r\noriginal work, and breaks the great period of literary silence between\r\nChaucer and Spenser. When we say, “Man proposes, God disposes,” “skin\r\ndeep,” “robbing Peter to pay Paul,” “of two evils choose the least,”\r\n“from pillar to post,” “sticking like burrs,” “over head and ears,” “you\r\ncannot touch pitch and not be defiled,” “making the mouth water,” “out\r\nof sight out of mind,” “the burnt child dreads the fire,” we are\r\nunconsciously using phrases which appear in their first form in\r\nBarclay’s writings.\r\n\r\nThe town was dominated by the College. The bridge by which you entered\r\nthe town from the west was the bridge of the Holy Saviour. In one of its\r\nrecesses the sacred light was ever kept burning, inviting those who\r\npassed to pray. We have Pater-noster Row, Jesu Street, Chapel Lane,\r\nButts (St. Budeaux) Hill, Paradise; names of a flavour ecclesiastical.\r\nIn the Flexton, as the open space is called where now the Town Hall and\r\na Jubilee Memorial Pillar to Queen Victoria stand, the markets and fairs\r\nwere held, and in the churchyard may still be seen the ancient stocks.\r\nGreat fires, however, in 1604, 1767, and 1866, have destroyed much of\r\ninterest in the town.\r\n\r\nHenry VI. visited the College in 1451, and Henry VII. in 1497.\r\n\r\nThe College disappeared at the Reformation. Some portion of its funds\r\nwere used to found the King’s Grammar School, which took root in what\r\nremained of the collegiate buildings. The fortunes of the school varied\r\nwith the capacities of the head masters. It was successful under the\r\nRev. John Coleridge, 1760–1781, and under his son, the Rev. George\r\nColeridge, 1794–1808, it became almost the equal of Blundell’s School at\r\nTiverton. It subsequently slowly declined, the buildings were unsuited\r\nto modern requirements, and it finally disappeared, reviving recently on\r\nanother site in another form under a scheme of the Charity Commission.\r\n\r\nThe town must have sadly suffered for a time from a dissolution of the\r\nCollege. But as soon as the rule of Philip II. in England was over, and\r\nhis fanaticism began to work in the Netherlands, the Flemings flying to\r\nEngland added a great impetus to our wool trade. Some, I think, must\r\nhave come to Ottery St. Mary, for a flourishing woollen industry sprang\r\nup here about this time, and a small outlying portion of the town still\r\nbears the name of Dunkirk. The pastoral character of the Vale of Otter,\r\nand the ample water-power of the river were advantageous to the trade,\r\nwhich was only killed by the discovery of steam.\r\n\r\nThe great factory built by Sir George Yonge, the Secretary of State for\r\nWar in 1790, a prominent feature to the passer-by, shows the extent to\r\nwhich the industry once flourished.\r\n\r\nIn Mill Street there stood a house “beturreted and wearing a monasterial\r\naspect,” which Sir Walter Ralegh, who was born at Poer’s Hayes, now\r\nHayesbarton, further down the valley, is said once to have inhabited. A\r\nhouse built in the quiet, dignified style of the eighteenth century,\r\ncalled Ralegh House, marks the site.\r\n\r\nOur town and vale were not unnoticed by poets. William Browne, the\r\nauthor of _Britannia’s Pastorals_, full of quaint conceits, but with a\r\ntrue vein of poetry running through them, alludes to the Naïads who fish\r\nand swim in the clear stream of Otter. And he is believed, on the\r\nauthority of Southey, to be the author of two fine inscriptions in the\r\nsmall south chapel of the church, one on John Sherman and his son, who\r\ndied on the same day in 1617, and one on the wife of Gideon Sherman, who\r\ndied in the first week of her marriage.\r\n\r\nMichael Drayton thus described the broad pastoral character of our\r\nvale:—\r\n\r\n        Here I’ll unyoke awhile, and turn my steeds to meat,\r\n        The land grows large and wide, my team begins to sweat.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Great Rebellion, Ottery St. Mary was for a time\r\noccupied by the King’s troops. At the advance of the Parliamentary army,\r\nhowever, in 1645, they withdrew beyond Exe, and the Roundheads took\r\ntheir place. The Commander-in-Chief, Sir Thomas Fairfax, took up his\r\nquarters at the Chanter’s House, then owned by Robert Collins, a strong\r\nsympathiser. Fairfax was accompanied by Ireton as Commissary, and John\r\nPickering as Colonel. In the dining-room, which still exists, and was\r\nthen called the Great Parlour, he met Lord General Cromwell, and\r\ndetermined on the plan of campaign against the King’s forces in the\r\nWest, which terminated in the capitulation of Sir Ralph Hopton in\r\nCornwall in March, 1646. This room Polwhele calls “the Convention Room.”\r\nHere also a number of members of Parliament, in the name of both Houses,\r\npresented Fairfax with a fair jewel set with diamonds of great value,\r\nwhich they tied with blue ribbon and hung about his neck in grateful\r\nrecognition of his signal services at Naseby.\r\n\r\nSickness overtook the army during its stay, and they removed to\r\nTiverton. Local opinion at the Restoration swung round to the Monarchy,\r\nthe Stuarts, and the Church of England. Violent strife, political and\r\necclesiastical, embittered social life. The Rev. Robert Collins, of the\r\nChanter’s House, a descendant of the host of Fairfax, was the leader of\r\nthe Nonconformists, and Mr. Haydon, of Cadhay, a fine quadrangular Tudor\r\nHouse in the neighbourhood, upheld the dominant party. Robert Collins\r\ninsisted on disobeying the Act of Uniformity, 1662, and the Conventicle\r\nAct, 1664. Haydon resolved to see the law obeyed. There was a constant\r\nbesetting of the Chanter’s House to discover the holding of an unlawful\r\nprayer-meeting, and finally persistent persecution drove Robert Collins\r\nand his family to Holland in 1685, where he died, brave and unflinching\r\nto the last, bequeathing money to the building of the Independent Chapel\r\nat Ottery St. Mary.\r\n\r\nThis chapel, built of old-time furze-burnt bricks in the manner known as\r\n“the Flemish bond,” is one of the oldest in the kingdom, has an air of\r\nQuaker-like seclusion, and is surrounded by a small graveyard occupying\r\nthe site of an ancient bowling green. There existed a trap-door in the\r\nfloor at the back of the pulpit, through which the minister could fly in\r\ncase of danger, into the vaults which still exist below the schoolroom.\r\nThe parish workhouse, now converted into cottages, stands near St.\r\nSaviour’s Bridge. Here, on the ground floor, were ranged the chained\r\nlunatics, to whom passers-by would throw scraps of bone and odds and\r\nends to appease their raving hunger.\r\n\r\nAt the Vicar’s House was born, in 1772, Samuel Taylor Coleridge. His\r\nfather, the Rev. John Coleridge, vicar and schoolmaster, was an erudite\r\nHebrew scholar, and assisted Dr. Kennicott in his literary labours. He\r\nwas a pious, simple soul, beloved by his family, whose amusing absence\r\nof mind is described in a diverting anecdote by De Quincey, not quite\r\nfit to be repeated here. One of his scholars was Francis Buller, who sat\r\nfor twenty-two years as a puisne judge, through whose influence Samuel\r\nTaylor Coleridge obtained a nomination at Christ’s Hospital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\n             _From the Portrait_]     [_By Peter Vandyck._\r\n                        SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to describe at length the career of Ottery St.\r\nMary’s most gifted son. But we can read in his poems of the profound\r\ninfluence of early scenes in the home of his boyhood upon the poet’s\r\nimagination. In his sonnet to the river Otter, his “native brook, wild\r\nstreamlet of the West,” in after years he calls up the vision of the\r\ncrossing plank, the marge with willows grey, the bedded sand, the flung\r\nstone leaping along its breast.\r\n\r\n             Then with quaint music hymn the parting gleam\r\n             By lonely Otter’s sleep-persuading stream.\r\n             Or where his wave with loud unquiet song\r\n             Dashed o’er the rocky channel froths along,\r\n             Or where his silver waters smoothed to rest\r\n             The tall tree’s shadow sleeps upon his breast.\r\n\r\nThe last two lines describe with exquisite felicity the peaceful\r\npassages between the “stickles” of the bickering river.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1789, he cut his initials, “S. T. C.,” on the rock just\r\noutside Pixie’s Parlour, a small cavern in the sandstone on the left\r\nbank half a mile down stream.\r\n\r\nAlways keenly sensible to music, the cadence of the old church bells\r\nrang in his ears in later life when far away from home, for he sings:—\r\n\r\n            Of my sweet birthplace, and the old Church Tower\r\n            Whose bells, the poor man’s only music, rang\r\n            From morn to evening, all the hot fair day.\r\n\r\nHe spoke of them to Charles Lamb, his schoolfellow; for though Charles\r\nLamb never came to Ottery St. Mary and never heard the bells, he makes\r\nhis characters allude to them thus:—\r\n\r\n_Marg._: Hark the bells, John! _John_: Those are the Church bells of St.\r\nMary Ottery—         St. Mary Ottery, my native village,         In the\r\nsweet shire of Devon,         Those are the bells.\r\n\r\nA. W. Kinglake, the author of _Eothen_ and the _History of the Crimean\r\nWar_, was educated here at Rock House, now Sandrock, under the Rev.\r\nEdward Coleridge, who kept a successful private school. In the year\r\n1849, Thackeray published the novel _Pendennis_. He lived as a youth at\r\nLarkbeare House, and the scene of many of his incidents is laid in the\r\nneighbourhood. We read of the little river running off noisily westward,\r\nof the fair background of sunshiny hills that stretch towards the sea,\r\nof the pattens clacking through the empty streets, of the schoolboys\r\nmaking a good, cheerful noise, scuffling with their feet as they march\r\ninto church and up the organ-loft stair, and blowing their noses a good\r\ndeal during the sermon; of the factory, of the single pair of old\r\nposters that earned their scanty livelihood by transporting the gentry\r\nround to the county dinners; of the hollow tree in Escot Park (then a\r\nnoble house built by Inigo Jones, since burnt down, and now replaced by\r\na modern building, the seat of the Right Hon. Sir J. H. Kennaway), in\r\nwhich the young lovers deposited their letters; and above all of the\r\ngreat grey towers rising up in purple splendour, of which the sun\r\nilluminates the delicate carving, deepening the shadows of the huge\r\nbuttresses and gilding the glittering windows.\r\n\r\nThe town contributed its share to science. Here, in 1806, in Ralegh\r\nHouse, was born Edward Davy. In 1836 he sketched out a plan of\r\ntelegraphic communication, and in 1837 he laid down a copper wire round\r\nthe inner circle at Regent’s Park, and made wonderful experiments in\r\nelectricity with it. In March, 1837, he took the first step to patent\r\nhis invention by “entering a caveat,” and deposited with Mr. Aikin,\r\nSecretary of the Society of Arts, a sealed description of his invention,\r\nanticipating Cook and Wheatstone by two months. His invention and that\r\nof Cook and Wheatstone were held not to be quite identical. In 1839 he\r\nemigrated to Australia, leaving the field to his rivals.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants are remarkable for the love which they bear towards\r\ntheir birthplace. In London a society of over one hundred members of\r\ntownsfolk who have left to seek their fortunes in other scenes meet at\r\nregular intervals to talk over the present local gossip and call up past\r\nassociations, and to renew or form a community of feeling based on\r\ncommon love of home. And when the members take a holiday, the first\r\nobject of their pilgrimage, the shrine towards which their footsteps are\r\ndirected, is the dear old town of Ottery St. Mary.\r\n\r\n                                                          COLERIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     “PETER PINDAR”: THE THERSITES\r\n                            OF KINGSBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n                        BY THE REV.

His\r\nchief character, giving name to the book by which he is best known, was\r\nsuggested by Sir Samuel Luke, his puritan patron, whilst the book\r\nitself, commenced in 1663 and modelled after the Don Quixote of\r\nCervantes, is in its faithful exposure of cant and hypocrisy scarcely\r\ninferior to its spirited Spanish prototype.\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\n      _From a Painting by Opie._]     [_Engraved by C.

WOLCOT (“PETER PINDAR”).\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe other distinguished person who found a resting-place so near him,\r\nalso a satirist and an accomplished genius with many and varied gifts,\r\nwas Dr. John Wolcot, a Devonian, born at Kingsbridge, or, more\r\naccurately, Dodbrooke, who is better known as PETER PINDAR, whose lively\r\nwritings were most popular in the time of the later Georges, and who\r\nthen enjoyed a large measure of favour with society, whose questionable\r\nmanners he so fearlessly portrayed, and for a while at least with the\r\nCourt, every one of whom in turn, from the King and Prince Regent down\r\nto the royal kitchen maids and cooks, he mercilessly, cleverly, and\r\ncontinuously lampooned.\r\n\r\nIt is with this latter curious and cosmopolitan poet and satirist that\r\nwe have to do. We shall be obliged to tread carefully as we follow the\r\ntrack of his life and his literature, for at the very outset we must\r\nremember that the times in which he lived were coarse and in many ways\r\nobjectionable, and that he was, if not a product, at least a reflection\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nWe may wonder why he took upon himself the name of _Pindar_ with the\r\nadded apostolic difference—_Peter_. Was it done playfully or\r\nsatirically, as was usual with him? Perhaps it was a joke at the expense\r\nof his neighbours, whose talk was so seldom on literature and art, but\r\nso often on _oves et boves_. Turning to the _Biographia Classica_, which\r\nhe very possibly used, we read:—“_Pindar_, the first of the lyric poets\r\nborn in Bœotia.... He quitted his native country, which was proverbial\r\nfor the stupidity of its inhabitants, and went to Athens, where the\r\ngreatest honours were bestowed upon him.... Such was the respect paid to\r\nhis memory that when the Lacedemonians took Thebes, they spared his\r\nhouse, as also did Alexander the Great.” To this historical fact Wolcot\r\nfrequently alluded, as, for instance, in the clever poem entitled—\r\n\r\n                           AN ODE TO MY BARN.\r\n\r\n           By Lacedæmon men attack’d,\r\n           When Thebes in days of yore was sack’d,\r\n         And naught the fury of the troops could hinder;\r\n           What’s true yet marv’lous to rehearse,\r\n           So well the common soldiers relish’d verse,\r\n         They scorn’d to burn the dwelling-house of Pindar.\r\n\r\n           With awe did Alexander view\r\n           The house of my great cousin too,\r\n         And gazing on the building, thus he sigh’d—\r\n           “General Parmenio, mark that house before ye!\r\n           That lodging tells a melancholy story:\r\n         There Pindar liv’d (great Bard!) and there he died.\r\n\r\n           “The king of Syracuse, all nations know it,\r\n           Was celebrated by this lofty poet,\r\n         And made immortal by his strains:\r\n           Ah! could I find like him, a bard to sing me;\r\n           Would any man like him a poet bring me;\r\n         I’d give him a good pension for his pains.\r\n\r\n           “But, ah! Parmenio, ’mongst the sons of men,\r\n           This world will never see his like again;\r\n         The greatest bard that ever breath’d is dead!\r\n           Gen’ral Parmenio, what think you?”\r\n           “Indeed ’tis true, my liege, ’tis very true,”\r\n         Parmenio cry’d, and, sighing, shook his head.\r\n\r\n           Then from his pocket took a knife so nice,\r\n         With which he chipp’d his cheese and onions,\r\n           And from a rafter cut a handsome slice,\r\n         To make rare toothpicks for the Macedonians;\r\n           Just like the toothpicks which we see\r\n           At Stratford, made from Shakespear’s mulb’ry tree.\r\n\r\n           What pity that the squire and knight\r\n           Knew not to prophesy as well as fight;\r\n         Then had they known the future men of metre:\r\n           Then had the gen’ral and the monarch spy’d\r\n           In fate’s fair book, our nation’s equal pride,\r\n         That very Pindar’s cousin Peter!\r\n\r\n           Daughter of thatch, and stone, and mud,\r\n           When I, no longer flesh and blood,\r\n         Shall join the lyric bards some half a dozen;\r\n           Meed of high worth, and, ’midst th’ Elysian plains,\r\n           To Horace and Alcæus read my strains,\r\n         Anacreon, Sappho, and my great old cousin;\r\n\r\n           On thee shall rising generations stare,\r\n           That come to Kingsbridge and to Dodbrook fair,\r\n         For such thy history and mine shall learn;\r\n           Like Alexander shall they ev’ry one\r\n           Heave a deep sigh, and say, since Peter’s gone,\r\n         With rev’rence let us look upon his Barn.\r\n\r\nHis allusions to Pindar the Greater make one fear that he has paid an\r\nill compliment to his old friends, and that in his choice of a _nom de\r\nplume_ he has allowed, as in many other instances, his merciless satire\r\nto overcome his evenness of judgment. Like his namesake, he turned from\r\nthe country to find his laurels in the town, and there the parallel\r\nends. It is not true that the people of South Devon, who singularly\r\ncombine agricultural skill with good seamanship, so that they handle\r\nequally well the plough and the oar, are open to any implication of\r\nspecial dulness.\r\n\r\nThere is little in common between the two Pindars, the ancient and the\r\nmodern. Peter displayed great skill of a kind in his versification, but\r\nno one can say it was to any extent truly lyrical. We cannot imagine the\r\npeople singing his productions. They were popular, readable, pungent,\r\nsavoury (too much so by a long way), but certainly not lyrical, for he\r\nhad not the singer’s heart or the singer’s sweetness. Beyond the\r\nattraction of “apt alliteration’s artful aid,” we can see no great\r\nreason why he should have gone so far as Thebes in 540 B.C. to\r\nappropriate the name of that ancient singer of triumphal hymns for\r\nclassic warriors.\r\n\r\nThere is a pretty story of the older Pindar that a swarm of bees lighted\r\non his cradle in his infancy and left honey on his lips; but we fear in\r\nthe case of our hero they were wasps that came, and that they left some\r\nof the caustic venom of their stings.\r\n\r\nThe odes of Pindar the Great have survived and are to be admired “for\r\nsublimity of sentiment, grandeur of expression, energy and magnificence\r\nof style, boldness of metaphors, harmony of numbers, and elegance of\r\ndiction.” According to Horace he was inimitable, and all succeeding\r\nwriters have agreed in extolling his genius.\r\n\r\n_Peter Pindar_ also called his favourite productions odes. We have them\r\nbefore us in bulky quartos as originally published, and in numerous\r\nvolumes of pocket size as collected in 1816 by Walker. They were written\r\nin Cornwall, Devon, the West Indies, Bath and London, and covered a very\r\nwide range of subjects. He approached the realm of poetry as George\r\nMorland did that of pictorial art, refusing no subject on account of its\r\ncoarseness, and yet with his fidelity of treatment in describing both\r\nrustic and town life, has often shown a fine appreciation of truth and\r\nof the beautiful.\r\n\r\nLike George Morland he was spoiled by moral laxity, and like him always\r\ngives us a sad impression of what he might have been and might have\r\ndone, if his clever genius had been kept within bounds by moral\r\nrestraint. But, alas! even as an old man, he retained a taste for the\r\nfollies which corrupted his youth, and continued to reflect too\r\nfaithfully the spirit of those immoral days when the scandalous manners\r\nof the court were injurious alike to the Church and the State. It would\r\nhave been better for him to have taken the advice he gives in one of his\r\nodes:—\r\n\r\n              Build not, alas! your popularity\r\n              On that beast’s back ycleped Vulgarity,\r\n              A beast that many a booby takes a pride in,\r\n              A beast beneath the noble Peter’s riding.\r\n\r\n                  .     .     .     .     .     .\r\n\r\n              Envy not such as have surpast ye,\r\n              ’Tis very, very easy to be nasty.\r\n\r\nThe name of the classic Pindar has been associated with other writers\r\nthan Dr. Wolcot, who probably have better claims to use it than ever he\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nThomas Gray (1716–1771), whose monument in Westminster Abbey bears these\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n              No more the Grecian muse unrivalled reigns,\r\n                To Britain let the nations homage pay:\r\n              She felt a Homer’s fire in Milton’s strains,\r\n                A Pindar’s rapture in the lyre of Gray.\r\n\r\nJean Dorot (1507–1588) and Pouce Denis Debrun (1729–1807), have each\r\nworn the title of French Pindar, whilst Gabriello Cluobrera (1552–1637)\r\nwas the acknowledged Italian Pindar. Peter’s work has been translated\r\ninto most of the continental tongues, and has been appreciated in\r\nGermany especially but not in France, his Francophobia being all too\r\nevident in many allusions to the French people. His poetry is too full\r\nof the localisms of his native county to be fully appreciated by any but\r\nDevonians, and too full of personal and political references and\r\nallusions to persons about the court and in the London society of that\r\nday to appeal successfully to readers of the present generation.\r\n\r\nOur Dr. John Wolcot was the fourth child of Dr. Alexander Wolcot,\r\nhimself a surgeon’s son residing at Kingsbridge, on the bank of the\r\nestuary at the foot of the town. The grounds of the family dwelling\r\nextended from the old Dartmouth Road at the back down to the water’s\r\nedge, and the house, though much altered, still retains its name of\r\nPindar Lodge. His baptismal register, preserved at the Church of St.\r\nThomas à Becket, Dodbrooke, is dated May 9th, 1738. Of his mother we\r\nhave not been able to gather much information beyond her name—Mary\r\nRyder—and that she belonged to a local family. The Ryders are still\r\nnumerously represented in the townships both of Kingsbridge and\r\nDodbrooke.\r\n\r\nThe Grammar School of Kingsbridge, erected at the cost of the old\r\nPuritan, Thomas Crispin, Merchant of Exeter, and endowed by him in 1670,\r\nwas the place where he commenced his education under the mastership of\r\nJohn Morris. It is to be regretted that no roll of scholars earlier than\r\n1830 is extant, so that we have to depend upon indirect though undoubted\r\nevidence as to his connection with this school, but there are lively\r\nlegends of his school days preserved in the folk-lore of the district,\r\none of which is too characteristic to be omitted.\r\n\r\nA certain cobbler whose shop was in the street leading to the Grammar\r\nSchool, a man disliked by the boys, and specially so by young Wolcot,\r\nwas, to the amazement and horror of the whole township, reported to have\r\nbeen cruelly murdered whilst sitting at his stall. The neighbours, on\r\nlooking in, were terror-stricken to find the man and his shop from floor\r\nto ceiling bespattered with blood. The cobbler was certainly living, but\r\ntoo terrified to speak of the nature of his wounds, his features being\r\ncovered with gore. He was not, however, seriously injured; indeed he was\r\nmuch frightened and little hurt. What had happened was this. Young\r\nWolcot, whose threats of vengeance against the offender had been\r\nsomewhat mysterious for several days, had procured an old blunderbuss\r\nfrom his father’s house and had duly charged it with powder, but instead\r\nof shot had loaded it with _bullock’s blood_, and deliberately fired it\r\nin the cobbler’s face; of course in one moment transforming the whole\r\nappearance of things, and creating in the peaceful neighbourhood a great\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\nSuch escapades no doubt made it desirable that he should change his\r\nquarters, and he was presently transferred to the care of an uncle\r\npractising as a surgeon at Fowey, in Cornwall. He attended the Grammar\r\nSchool for awhile at Liskeard, and after that at Bodmin, under the\r\nmastership of a clergyman named Fisher.\r\n\r\nAfter this he spent one year in completion of his education in France\r\n(1760). He failed to appreciate the French, and the dislike was quite\r\nmutual. Of them he said in one of his odes:—\r\n\r\n               I hate the shrugging dogs,\r\n               I’ve lived among them, ate their frogs.\r\n                         —_Coll. Works_, Vol. I., p. 107.\r\n\r\nOn his return to England he became his uncle’s pupil and medical student\r\nfor seven years. A reflection of his duties is cleverly given in one of\r\nhis lyrics, apparently addressed to Opie, his pupil in art:—\r\n\r\n          The lad who would a ’Pothecary shine,\r\n          Should powder Claws of Crabs and Jalap fine,\r\n        Keep the shop clean, and watch it like a Porter,\r\n          Learn to boil glysters—nay, to give them too,\r\n          If blinking nurses can’t the business do:\r\n        Write well the labels, and wipe well the Mortar.\r\n                 —_Odes to Royal Academicians_, Ode iii., p. 8.\r\n\r\nDrawing, painting, and classical reading seem, however, to have claimed\r\ntoo much of his time, and his verse-making occupations were no doubt\r\nhindrances to his professional progress, for in them he was quite\r\nindustrious, and from Fowey, in 1756, he sent his poem on the elder\r\n“Pitt’s recovery from Gout” to _Martin’s Magazine_.\r\n\r\nHis apprenticeship over, he spent a short time in the medical schools of\r\nLondon; then he returned to Devon, where Dr. Huxham, a celebrated\r\nPlymouth physician, did him the good service of examining him as to his\r\ncompetency in medicine and surgery, and recommended him to a northern\r\nuniversity—that of Aberdeen—for a degree by diploma, which he was\r\nfortunate enough to get conferred upon him, receiving his M.D. in\r\nSeptember, 1767.\r\n\r\nIn the same year came an opportunity for foreign travel, of which he\r\neagerly availed himself. Sir William Trelawney, a connection of the\r\nfamily on his mother’s side, and a patient of his uncle’s in Cornwall,\r\nwas that same year appointed Governor of the island of Jamaica, and\r\ntaking young Wolcot with him, in a short time made the new-fledged\r\ndoctor Physician General to the Forces in the island.\r\n\r\nWhilst there, in 1769, the idea seems to have occurred to his patron\r\nrather than to himself that if he could give his young friend nothing\r\nmore in the way of official promotion, there was yet the hopeful field\r\nof Church preferment, which, in the West Indies, he was able to command.\r\nThe rich living of St. Ann’s, Jamaica, then enjoyed by an invalid\r\nclergyman, was likely to be soon vacant by his demise. Sir William was\r\nthe patron, and without sufficient thought, as it seems to us, of\r\nWolcot’s unfitness for such a solemn responsibility, urged him to go at\r\nonce to England and qualify by ordination for the post.\r\n\r\nThis curious candidate for holy orders was actually ordained deacon on\r\nJune 24th, 1769, and the following day priest, but he did not on his\r\nreturn secure the living of St. Ann’s, as the incumbent recovered his\r\nhealth and lived on for years. He was, however, solaced by the inferior\r\nliving of Vere, a parish for which Wolcot procured the services of a\r\ncurate, himself continuing to reside in the Government House at Spanish\r\nTown. The history of this transaction and the profanity of the language\r\nin which it is recorded are alike scandalous.\r\n\r\n“Go,” said Sir William, “and get japanned. You may safely say that you\r\nhave an inward call, for a hungry stomach can speak as loudly as a\r\nhungry soul!” _O tempora, O mores!_ How very few persons ever imagine\r\nPeter Pindar in clerical guise. Sir William Trelawney died, Wolcot\r\nreturned to England in company with his widow, who died on the voyage.\r\nOnce more in England, he showed his good sense by reverting, despite the\r\naxiom “once a clerk always a clerk,” for his future occupation to\r\nmedicine, letters, or the fine arts, leaving the sacred office to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nAs a medical man Peter Pindar was a modified failure at the best. He was\r\ncordially disliked by his brother practitioners in the Truro district,\r\nwho in the end drove him out of it. His treatment of fever patients with\r\ncopious libations of cold water roused their wrath, and they utterly\r\ndespised the theory expressed in his own words that “a physician can do\r\nlittle more than watch Dame Nature and give her a shove on the back when\r\nhe sees her inclined to do right.”\r\n\r\nIn letters he was far more successful, and was undoubtedly the most\r\npopular satirical poet of the Georgian period. Whether he lampooned\r\nindividuals, or public bodies, the Royal Academicians, or Royalty\r\nitself, his versatile genius displayed such a wide range of\r\naccomplishments that he attracted hosts of readers, and his books\r\ncommanded a prodigious sale. All the world has read of the King’s visit\r\nto Whitbread’s Brewery, and his wondering how the apples got into the\r\napple dumplings, and not a few readers have felt for Sir Joseph Banks,\r\nJames Boswell, and Benjamin West, as they came in turn under his\r\nstinging lash.\r\n\r\nHis principal poems were issued from time to time as shilling or\r\nhalf-crown pamphlets. They were written in irregular, rollicking metre,\r\nthe most important of them in the form of odes. In these he shines as a\r\ncritic of music, painting, and literature. In all these directions he\r\nwas, as he describes himself, “the most merciless Mohawk that ever\r\nscalped.” By such an expression he puts himself out of court as a safe\r\nand equitable judge. His appreciations of Wilson, of Gainsborough, of\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds, and of J. M. W. Turner, have been endorsed by the\r\nforemost art writers of our time. Of Turner he said:—\r\n\r\n                  Turner, whatever strikes thy mind,\r\n                  Is painted well, and well designed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps his least-known verses are those written for music and published\r\nfrom Exeter in the time of Jackson, the Cathedral organist, who was\r\nresponsible for the airs to which they were sung. His own musical\r\naccomplishments were undoubtedly varied and sound.\r\n\r\nDr. Wolcot had much of the Bohemian in his constitution. He lived in a\r\ntown where to this day a Puritan simplicity of manners marks the habits\r\nof the middle-class people. Quakers, Baptists, and Independents of the\r\nearly Presbyterian type were numerous in the Kingsbridge of his day. If\r\nthe old barn to which he addressed some of his odes could speak, it\r\nwould tell of the visits of strolling players who, anathematised\r\nelsewhere, but welcomed by Peter Pindar, were allowed there to perform\r\ntheir bloodcurdling tragedies and questionable farces, to the scandal of\r\nthe “unco guid.” And besides all this, old Richard Stanley, the king of\r\nthe gipsies, grandfather of the present Romany patriarch of that name,\r\nwas welcomed year by year to a shake-down in the straw when he came\r\nhorse-dealing to Kingsbridge or to Dodbrooke Fair. Wolcot stoutly\r\nmaintained that he never lost an egg or a chicken by his hospitality to\r\nthe gipsies. We have heard the Bucklands, the Stanleys, and the Lees\r\nspeak of his memory as of one who was kind to their fathers, and we have\r\nconversed with old people who have spoken of the building, which now\r\nstands almost unaltered, as the only theatre in Kingsbridge. Its\r\ninterior is wonderfully like the picture of Hogarth’s called the\r\n“Strolling Players.” The fact that Bamfield Moore Carew, the king of the\r\nbeggars, frequently lodged in it, adds historical interest to the\r\npicturesque and venerable shanty.\r\n\r\nDr. Wolcot’s real kindness to John Opie, whom he discovered as a lad\r\nworking in a saw pit; his industrious endeavours to educate and refine\r\nhim; and his generous assumption of fullest responsibility for his\r\nmaintenance, together with his introduction of him to the world in\r\nLondon, form a creditable chapter in his history which ought never to be\r\nomitted from Peter’s life story. In Dugdale’s _British Traveller_ will\r\nbe found the copy of a written contract made by Opie in favour of his\r\npatron and friend. It begins—\r\n\r\n  I promise to paint for Dr. Wolcot any picture or pictures he may\r\n  demand, as long as I live; otherwise I desire the world will consider\r\n  me as an ungrateful son of a ——. [The words are unquotable.]\r\n\r\nOpie stood to this obligation, but always made his friend pay\r\neighteenpence for the canvas!\r\n\r\nOpie is said to have paid great deference to Dr. Wolcot’s instructions.\r\nWhilst that gentleman was painting, he would sometimes lean over him and\r\nexclaim, “Ah! if I could ever paint like you!” to which Pindar replied,\r\n“If I thought thou wouldst not exceed me, John, I would not take such\r\npains with thee.” For two years he never painted a single picture\r\nwithout the judgment of his friend.\r\n\r\nIt was at the Doctor’s suggestion that his name was changed from Hoppy\r\nto Opie, a name worn by a good family in Cornwall, and more likely to\r\nattract favourable notice in London, whither they both went together in\r\n1780, their joint expenses being supplied from one purse. Out of this\r\nlast circumstance grew a dispute and estrangement, never fully settled.\r\nThe communistic arrangement lasted for a short time only. One morning,\r\nwhen Sir Joshua Reynolds was breakfasting with Wolcot and Opie, Sir\r\nJoshua remarked of Opie, “Why, this boy begins his art where other\r\npeople leave off!” Very numerous are the portraits of his patron which\r\nOpie has left behind, representing Pindar in different stages of his\r\ncareer, most of them having been engraved and published in various\r\neditions of his works, or in miscellanies containing contributions from\r\nhis pen.\r\n\r\nIf a watchful editor did not restrict us for space, we should have liked\r\nto show how that facile pen of Peter’s could run on “from grave to gay,\r\nand from lively to severe.” Perhaps there may be room for a sample of\r\neach. We wish he had given us a little more of such quiet and pathetic\r\nwriting as\r\n\r\n                        THE OLD SHEPHERD’S DOG.\r\n\r\n   The old shepherd’s dog like his master was gray,\r\n     His teeth all departed and feeble his tongue,\r\n   Yet where’er Corin went, he was followed by Tray;\r\n     Thus happy through life did they hobble along.\r\n\r\n   When fatigued on the grass the shepherd would lie\r\n     For a nap in the sun—’midst his labours so sweet,\r\n   His faithful companion crawled constantly nigh,\r\n     Plac’d his head on his lap or lay down at his feet.\r\n\r\n   When winter was heard on the hill and the plain,\r\n     And torrents descended and cold was the wind,\r\n   If Corin went forth ’midst the tempests and rain,\r\n     Tray scorned to be left in the chimney behind.\r\n\r\n   At length in the straw Tray made his last bed;\r\n     For vain against death is the stoutest endeavour—\r\n   To lick Corin’s hand, he rear’d up his weak head,\r\n     Then fell back, closed his eyes, and, ah! clos’d them for ever.\r\n\r\n   Not long after Tray did the shepherd remain,\r\n     Who oft o’er his grave in true sorrow would bend;\r\n   And when dying, thus feebly was heard the poor swain,\r\n     “Oh! bury me, neighbour, beside my old friend.”\r\n\r\nIs not that a genuine piece of pure pastoral writing—grave and truthful?\r\nOf his gay writing there is more than enough, and much of it is as unfit\r\nfor modern quotation as some of the classics in whom he delighted. As\r\nThomas Bewick could not be persuaded that anything he actually saw was\r\nunsuited for pictorial representation, however vulgar, if the drawing\r\nwere true to nature, so Pindar shocks our sense of propriety continually\r\nand without apology. He could, however, play on the whole gamut of the\r\nsoul’s passions, as witness his touching threnody on “Julia, or the\r\nVictim of Love,” in his _Smiles and Tears_, a piece no man without a\r\ntender heart could ever have written.\r\n\r\nMany jocular little pieces like the following are strewn among his\r\nverses:—\r\n\r\n                        =ODE (_Introductory_).=\r\n\r\n         Simplicity, I dote upon thy tongue;\r\n         And thee, O white-rob’d _Truth_, I’ve reverenced long—\r\n           I’m fond too of that flashy varlet wit,\r\n         Who skims earth, sea, heav’n, hell, existence o’er\r\n         To put the merry table in a roar,\r\n           And shake the sides with laugh-convulsing fit.\r\n\r\n         O yes! in sweet simplicity I glory—\r\n         To _her_ we owe a charming little story.\r\n\r\n                =WILLIAM PENN, NATHAN, AND THE BAILIFF.=\r\n                                A Tale.\r\n\r\n        As well as I can recollect,\r\n          It is a story of fam’d _William Penn_,\r\n        By bailiffs oft beset, without effect,\r\n          Like numbers of our Lords and Gentlemen.\r\n\r\n        William had got a private hole to spy\r\n          The folks who came with writs, or “How d’ye do?”\r\n        Possessing too a penetrating eye\r\n          Friends from his foes the Quaker quickly knew.\r\n\r\n        A bailiff in disguise, one day,\r\n          Though not disguised to our friend Will,\r\n        Came, to Will’s shoulder compliments to pay,\r\n          Concealed, the catchpole thought, with wondrous skill.\r\n\r\n        Boldly he knocked at William’s door,\r\n          Drest like a gentleman from top to toe,\r\n        Expecting quick admittance, to be sure,\r\n          But no!\r\n\r\n        WILL’S servant NATHAN, with a strait-hair’d head\r\n          Unto the window gravely stalked, not _ran_.\r\n        “Master at home?” the Bailiff sweetly said—\r\n          “Thou canst not speak to him,” replied the man.\r\n\r\n        “What,” quoth the Bailiff, “won’t he see me then?”\r\n          “Nay,” snuffled Nathan, “let it not thus strike thee;\r\n        Know, verily, that WILLIAM PENN\r\n          _Hath seen_ thee, but he doth not _like_ thee.”\r\n\r\nA Kingsbridge gentleman having recently come across the original\r\nmanuscript of one of the characteristic pieces written by Peter Pindar,\r\nhas kindly allowed its publication. It will be seen that the rhyme\r\ndescribes in his forceful and not over polite style the outcome of a\r\nmagistrates’ meeting at Morleigh after the passing of the law against\r\npoaching. It is in the Devonshire dialect:—\r\n\r\n                               =EPISTLE.=\r\n\r\n From Deggony Dolt, farmer, of Stanborough; to John Tolt, waggoner, of\r\n                             Clannaborough.\r\n\r\n       Lord Jan! hast thee heer’d that at leet Morleigh Town,\r\n       Where Just Asses often rag w——e, rogue and clown,\r\n       A learge drove of Passons and Tomies and Squires\r\n       Met lately to ruin the Poachers and Buyers?\r\n       How vierce and how vine they came scampering in,\r\n       Zome dreiving, zome riding, zome vat and zome thin;\r\n       This mounted on Pony and that Rozinante,\r\n       Zome Galloways shodded, zome whisky, zome jaunty.\r\n\r\n       Mum Doubtful, Tom Guzzle, Jack Jaw, and Ned Tilly,\r\n       Dick Doubty, Jan Numskull, and Blockheaded Billy,\r\n       Jan Clod from the vield, Janny Jumps from the Shop,\r\n       His father sells Incle, woll buy and woll zwop;\r\n       Young Nincompoop Simpkins, the son of Jan Huffer,\r\n       Wat Windy, Soft Stephen, and Peter the Puffer,\r\n       Like mazed men were eager their plans to express,\r\n       Tho’ as to their reasons they cou’d not be less,\r\n       Where brains are but little and Tyranny’s found\r\n       Much bother and bluster most times do abound.\r\n\r\n       Our Squires of those yet but a few by the bye\r\n       War zich; as to their others, that’s all in my eye,\r\n       Our Squires and Parsons and limbs of the Law\r\n       Determined strong rules and resolves for to draw,\r\n       And then in the Papers the whole advertise,\r\n       Sure most as they thaut you’d be acting more wise,\r\n       All Game must in future to none else belong,\r\n       Their Rerts were so clear, their powers so strong.\r\n\r\n       To dinner they went, where they grinned and they sneer’d;\r\n       The Bottle pushed round till with drink their eyes glared,\r\n       All speakers at once, nort but d—m—ie was plain,\r\n       Ev’n Parsons took roundly the Lord’s name in vain;\r\n       The Reckoning discharged yet at this zome looked bluff,\r\n       And grudged the expense tho’ ’twas reasonable enough;\r\n       Zome gallopped away, zome halted at ease,\r\n       Zome mounted their ponies and two wheeled post chaise.\r\n       Not far howsomever went Mum Doubtful ’twas zed\r\n       When he tumbled and luckily valled on his head;\r\n       Tom Guzzle over zit in a Ditch on the road,\r\n       And eased his gorged Stomach of part of its load.\r\n       Jan Clod lodged his bones where bars grow in clumps,\r\n       And under a hen roost sprawled leet Janny Jumps,\r\n       Reversed lay Soft Staphen his heels only zeed,\r\n       The rest was concealed in the Briers and Weed;\r\n       Here plunged in a Buddle roll’d Parson Jack Daw,\r\n       There bald pate Dick Doubty was emptying his Maw,\r\n       Wat Windy proceeded, but at length came to ground,\r\n       Zome say that his nose in a Cow Dung was found;\r\n       But Nort’s ne’er in danger who’s born to be hung,\r\n       Will never meet death till on gallows he’s slung.\r\n       Jan Numscull, a Mushroom that’s lately arose,\r\n       Now stretched on a Dunghill had fuming repose;\r\n       Young Nincompoop Simpkin lay speechless hard by,\r\n       A large Dap of Cow Dung had closed his left eye,\r\n       And Peter the Puffer, he could not tell how,\r\n       In spite of his boasting rode into a slough,\r\n       While snug in a hogstie got Parson Ned Tilly,\r\n       And under a Vuz bush snored Blockheaded Billy,\r\n       Thus ended the meeting that made Poachers tremble.\r\n       The next thee shall hear when again they assemble.\r\n\r\nThe late Rev. Treasurer Hawker, M.A., in his sketch of Wolcot, written\r\nfor the Devonshire Association in 1877 and published in their\r\n_Transactions_, describes most accurately Pindar’s very humorous account\r\nof George the Third’s visit to Exeter in _Brother Jan’s Epistle to\r\nZester Naw_. He says:—\r\n\r\n  The humour is irresistible. It is impossible not to laugh.... There is\r\n  a rollicking swing about the description which keeps the whole\r\n  narrative going like the steady onward pace of a racing eight-oar, or\r\n  the _vis vivida_ of a fast four-horse coach.\r\n\r\nHe quotes these stanzas as characteristic alike of the humour and the\r\ndialect. Introducing the Royal entry:—\r\n\r\n                 Well, in a come _King George_ to town\r\n                 With doust and zweat as nutmeg brown,\r\n                   The hosses all in smoke:\r\n                 Huzzain, trumpetin, and dringin,\r\n                 Red colours vleein, roarin, zingin,\r\n                   So mad seemed all the voke.\r\n\r\nThe King was not entertained at the Palace, but was sent to the Dean.\r\nPeter says:—\r\n\r\n                   Becaze the Bishop sent mun word\r\n                     _A hadn’t got the means_.\r\n                   A could not meat and drink afford.\r\n\r\nPeter affected to have heard the King’s remarks about the cathedral:—\r\n\r\n               Zo, said, “Neat, neat; clean, very clean;\r\n               D’ye mop it, mop it, Measter Dean,\r\n                 Mop, mop it every week?”\r\n\r\nThe unhappy reference of Farmer Tab to the King’s mental condition,\r\nthough concealed by his dialect, was simply cruel, and, of course, was\r\ncarefully preserved by Peter:—\r\n\r\n                And, Varmer Tab, I understand,\r\n                Drode his legs vore and catched the hand\r\n                  And shaked wey might and main.\r\n                “I’m glad your Medjesty to zee,\r\n                And hope your Medjesty,” quoth he,\r\n                  “Wull ne’er be _mazed_ again.”\r\n\r\nThe King is befogged by the Devonshire word:—\r\n\r\n           “Maz’d, maz’d, what’s maz’d,” then said the King,\r\n           “I never heerd of zich a thing.\r\n           What’s maz’d, what, what, my lord?”\r\n           “Hem,” zed my lord, and blow’d his nose,\r\n           “Hem, hem, sir, ’tis, I do suppose,\r\n           Sir, an old Devonshire word.”\r\n\r\nJan Ploughshare is made to say in a later stanza that he has found\r\nroyalty so disappointing a show that when he gets home to Moreton and\r\nreads his Bible he shall for the future “skep the books of Kings.”\r\n\r\nThe late Rev. Treasurer Hawker further says:—\r\n\r\n  Kingsbridge may point with some degree of pride to her son’s sturdy\r\n  independence, his dislike of jobbery and shams, his refusal to be\r\n  blinded or muzzled in his denunciation of abuses by any powerful\r\n  position or high rank.... Wolcot was a bad, sensual, vindictive man,\r\n  yet a certain respect must, I think, be paid to one who in an age\r\n  inclined to toadyism of big people, did not shrink from confronting\r\n  the false idols of the day, even if sometimes he toppled them over\r\n  with undue violence and contempt.—(Sketch of Wolcot read at\r\n  Kingsbridge, July, 1887. _Transact. Devon. Association._)\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ gives this most accurate\r\nappreciation:—\r\n\r\n  Wolcot’s humour was broad, and he cared little whether he hit above or\r\n  below the belt, but he had a keen eye for the ridiculous, and was\r\n  endowed with a wondrous facility of diction.\r\n\r\nThe same writer truly says that many of his serious pieces were marked\r\nby taste and feeling, and his translation of Thomas Warton’s Latin\r\nepigram on sleep dwells in the memory through its happy simplicity.\r\n\r\nThe story is told of the bargain which he made with the London\r\npublishers, who, hearing that he proposed to sell his copyrights, told\r\noff one of their representatives to negotiate with him. The agent found\r\nthe old Doctor quite ready for him, sitting up in bed with a fine\r\nchurchyard cough in splendid development, and with a side-table\r\nfurnished with an impressive array of medicines. At first a sum was\r\noffered which Peter considered contemptibly small. He asked at once a\r\npayment of some three hundred pounds a year, and amidst much painful\r\ncoughing managed to say, “I shall not live, I know, to enjoy it long, as\r\nyou may see, so there is no excuse for meanness in my case.” The agent\r\nwas quite impressed by the scene, and the bargain was closed for two\r\nhundred and fifty pounds yearly for his life, with the condition that\r\nall future writing was to be for them alone. This was in 1795, and to\r\nthe chagrin of his publishers he displayed the vitality so often seen in\r\nannuitants, and actually lived on for nearly a quarter of a century to\r\nenjoy their reluctant generosity.\r\n\r\nHis minor poems are oftener quoted because they are freer from\r\nobjectionable matter. _The Razor Seller_, and _The Pilgrim and the Peas_\r\nare well known, and have been used as recitations, but his longer odes\r\nand letters had more than a passing notice, they were so strong in their\r\nsatire, and so numerous as to have affected public opinion. The very\r\nGovernment were alarmed and pressed upon him a pension as a means of\r\npreventing further onslaughts upon the foibles and peculiarities of the\r\nking. Some preliminary payments were actually received by him, and all\r\nwas at one time apparently settled in his favour when he suddenly\r\nreturned the monies paid him, objecting to the conditions of silence and\r\ndeclining all further favours.\r\n\r\nCruel to the peculiarities of others, he was most sensitive himself to\r\ncriticism, and hungry for praise, as he admits in an appeal to his\r\nreviewers:—\r\n\r\n            I am no cormorant for fame, d’ye see;\r\n              I ask not _all_ the laurel, but a _sprig_!\r\n            Then hear me, Guardians of the sacred Tree,\r\n              And stick a leaf or two about my wig.\r\n\r\n            In sonnet, ode, and legendary tale,\r\n              Soon will the press my tuneful works display;\r\n            Then do not damn ’em, and prevent the sale;\r\n              And your petitioner shall ever pray.\r\n\r\nIt must have been hateful to him to have found at last, in Gifford, the\r\nscholar and critic who attacked him in the anti-Jacobin magazine in an\r\narticle entitled “Nil admirari, etc.,” a foeman whose satire was as\r\nstrong as his own. Gifford speaks of Peter Pindar as “this disgusting\r\nsubject, the prolific reviler of his Sovereign and impious blasphemer of\r\nhis God”; hard words for one to put up with, however clearly he may have\r\ndeserved them. Though his character is not exemplary, and cleverness\r\nmust not be allowed to atone for lack of moral sense, we do not wish to\r\npaint him of too black a hue, if only for charity’s sake. Gifford’s\r\nattack was strong and straight, and it may be doubted if Peter’s\r\nreputation ever survived it. There was a common fight between these two\r\nin which Peter came off worst. He deserved it, for he was the aggressor.\r\nDiscredited in the popular estimation, he lingered on for a while, and\r\nthough from 1811 to 1819 he was suffering from blindness and infirmity,\r\nhe dictated verses until within a few days of his death.\r\n\r\nCommencing his London residence in 1781, soon after the publication of\r\nhis first book of lyric odes, he lived in many different houses, in\r\nSouthampton Row (1793); Tavistock Row (1794); Chapel Street, Portland\r\nPlace (1800); 8, Delany Place, Camden Town (1802); 94, Tottenham Court\r\nRoad (1807); and Latham Place, Somer’s Town, where he died on the 14th\r\nJanuary, 1819.\r\n\r\nOf his personal appearance much has been said. He has been described as\r\n“a thick, squat man with a large, dark and flat face and no speculation\r\nin his eye.” There are many portraits of him published, most of them by\r\nhis _protégé_, Opie, the “Cornish boy,” as he calls him, whom he both\r\neducated and boomed in the press, a genius of undoubted merit as a\r\npainter. Unless these pictures outrageously flatter him, his must have\r\nbeen a fine physiognomy. We have seen eight or nine portraits, taken at\r\ndifferent periods of his life, and in all he appears like a well-bred\r\nand handsome man of the style and period of George the Fourth. There is\r\na miniature of him, however, in the National Portrait Gallery, which is\r\nsaid with candour to express many of the disagreeable features of his\r\ncharacter. Our own portrait appended to this sketch is from a painting\r\nby Opie, engraved by C. H. Hodges, and reproduced in photography by\r\nBailey, of Kingsbridge. One of his most faithful portraits is a\r\nminiature by Lethbridge, a Kingsbridge artist of some fame, who was born\r\nat Goveton, a little hamlet not far from the town.\r\n\r\nProbably the last public compliment ever received by Peter Pindar was\r\nthe dedication by his scholarly neighbour to him of the well-known\r\n_History of Kingsbridge_, published in 1819 (the year of Pindar’s death)\r\nby A. Hawkins, Esq., F.H.S. With the terms of that dedication we might\r\nfitly close our notice:—\r\n\r\n  To JOHN WOLCOT, M.D., long accredited at the Court of Apollo as Peter\r\n  Pindar, Esq., these pages commemorative of the History and Topography\r\n  of the vicinity of his native earth, are by his permission dedicated\r\n  as a mark of sincere respect for his superior genius and talents.\r\n\r\nIf in our sketch of Peter Pindar we have “extenuated aught,” we have\r\nbeen wishful to “set down naught in malice,” and can only endorse the\r\nuniversal opinion as to his talent, with the unconcealed wish that such\r\ngreat power had been allowed to exert itself on a higher plane and to a\r\nnobler purpose.\r\n\r\n             O quantum est in rebus inane!\r\n                                           —_Pers.

The picturesque\r\nstreet seems to have a repose amid its beautiful surroundings\r\ncommensurate with the peaceful industry that has made its undying fame;\r\nfor thanks to its having been the head-quarters of the beautiful lace\r\nmanufacture, the name of Honiton is better known than that of many a big\r\ncity. That its renown should have overshadowed other places is doubtless\r\nowing to its being situated on the great coach roads from London and\r\nfrom Bath to Exeter and the ports beyond; travellers were brought to the\r\nspot, who would alight while their horses rested; they would then be\r\noffered a box of lace at the inn to select from, while the work-girls\r\nthemselves looked out for the arrival of the coaches and pressed their\r\nwares on the occupants, who took away their purchases to other parts of\r\nthe country as a speciality of Honiton.\r\n\r\nRisdon[12] speaks of it as “a great Market and Thorough-Fair, from East\r\nto West,” and Westcote[13] writes:—“It is a great thoroughfare from\r\nCornwall, Plymouth, and Exeter to London; and for the better receipt of\r\ntravellers, very well furnished with Inns.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  _Survey of Devon_, 1605–20 (printed editions, 1785, 1811).\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  _View of Devon_, _circiter_ 1630 (first printed, 1845).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\n           _From a Photograph_]     [_By Miss Alice Dryden._\r\n                             HONITON LACE.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nLace-making has been practically limited to that part of the county\r\nsouth of Exeter which lies between Dorset and the Exe. The industry\r\nfound its way to Devonshire, if the generally accepted theory be\r\ncorrect, by the Flemish refugees flying from the persecutions of the\r\nDuke of Alva. Lace was made on the pillow in the Low Countries about the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century, so by the date of the Alva persecution\r\n(1568–77) the people might have learnt it in sufficient numbers to start\r\nit wherever they set up their new home.\r\n\r\nThere is much probability to support this theory, and some names of\r\nundoubted Flemish origin did and do still exist in Honiton, as Gerard,\r\nMurch, Groot, Trump. On the other hand, if there had been any\r\nconsiderable number of Flemings in Devonshire they would surely have\r\nfounded a Company of their Reformed Church, and no reference is found in\r\nthe published books of the Archives of the London Dutch Church of any\r\nsuch Company in Devonshire; whereas references abound to places in the\r\neastern counties and Midlands where Flemings were established.\r\n\r\nIt was not till we read of bone[14] lace that it may be taken to mean\r\npillow lace, made either with fish bones as pins or sheep’s trotters as\r\nbobbins. That bones were used as bobbins is stated by Fuller;[15] but\r\nthe fish bone theory is also possible; pins were very high priced at\r\nthat time, and it would have been perfectly possible to use fish bones\r\nfine enough for the geometrical laces of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  The term _bone_ lace is wrongly interpreted as representing the raised\r\n  Venetian points, which have been likened to carved ivory or bone.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  _Worthies_, 1662.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth was much addicted to the collecting and wearing of\r\nbeautiful clothes, but no definite mention of English lace seems to\r\noccur in the Royal Wardrobe Accounts.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of Honiton lace is by Westcote—“At Axminster you\r\nmay be furnished with fine flax thread there spun. At Honiton and\r\nBradnidge with bone lace much in request”;[16] and, referring again to\r\nHoniton—“Here is made abundance of bone-lace, a pretty toye now greatly\r\nin request”; and therefore the town may say with merry Martial—\r\n\r\n                   In praise for toyes such as this,\r\n                   Honiton second to none is.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  _View of Devon._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe famous inscription on a tombstone in Honiton Churchyard, together\r\nwith Westcote, proves the industry to have been well established in the\r\nreign of James I. The inscription runs:—\r\n\r\n  Here lyeth ye body of James Rodge, of Honinton in ye County of\r\n  Devonshire, (Bonelace Siller, hath given unto the poore of Honinton\r\n  P’ishe the benyfitt of £100 for ever) who deceased ye 27 of July A^o\r\n  D^i 1617 ÆTATÆ SVAE 50. Remember the Poore.\r\n\r\nThere have been traditions that Rodge was a valet who accompanied his\r\nmaster abroad and there, learning the fine Flemish stitches, taught some\r\nDevonshire women on his return home, and was enabled to make a\r\ncomfortable competence by their work.\r\n\r\nRodge was not the only benefactor to the town connected with the\r\nindustry; there are two others recorded in the seventeenth century.\r\n“Although the earliest known MS., Ker’s _Synopsis_, 1561, giving an\r\naccount of the different towns in Devonshire, makes no mention of lace,\r\nwe find from it that Mrs. Minifie, one of the earliest named\r\nlace-makers, was an Englishwoman.”[17] “She was a daughter of John Flay,\r\nVicar of Buckrell, near Honiton.”[18] She died in 1617, and left money\r\nfor the indigent townspeople, as did Thomas Humphrey, of Honiton,\r\nlace-maker, in 1658.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  _History of Lace._ Mrs. Palliser, 1901.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  _Worthies of Devon._ Prince, 1701.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the lace trade were realized by the time of the\r\nCommonwealth. Fuller,[19] writing during that period, says of bone\r\nlace:—\r\n\r\n  Much of this is made in and about Honyton, and weekly returned to\r\n  London. Some will have it called Lace, _à Lacinia_, used as a fringe\r\n  on the borders of cloathes. Bone-lace it is named, because first made\r\n  with bone (since wooden) bobbins ...\r\n\r\n  Modern the use thereof in England, and not exceeding the middle of the\r\n  Raign of Queen Elizabeth. Let it not be condemned for a superfluous\r\n  wearing, because it doth neither hide nor heat; seeing it doth adorn.\r\n  Besides, though private persons pay for it, it stands the State in\r\n  nothing; not expensive of Bullion, like other lace, costing nothing\r\n  save a little thread descanted on by art and industry. Hereby many\r\n  children who otherwise would be burthensome to the Parish prove\r\n  beneficial to their Parents. Yea, many lame in their limbs, and\r\n  impotent in their arms, if able in their fingers, gain a livelyhood\r\n  thereby; not to say that it saveth some thousands of pounds yearly,\r\n  formerly sent over Seas to fetch Lace from Flanders.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  _Worthies_, 1662.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe English were always ready to protect their own trades and\r\nmanufactures, and various were the Acts passed to prohibit the\r\nimportation of foreign lace, for the encouragement of home workers. In\r\n1698 it was proposed to repeal the last Prohibition, and from the text\r\nof a Petition sent to the House of Commons, some interesting light is\r\nthrown on the extent of the trade at that date.\r\n\r\n  The making Bonelace has been an ancient Manufacture of England and the\r\n  Wisdom of our Parliaments all along thought it the interest of this\r\n  Kingdom to prohibit its Importation from Foreign Parts.... This has\r\n  revived the said Languishing Manufacture and there are now above one\r\n  hundred thousand People in England who get their living by it and Earn\r\n  by meer Labour £500,000 a year, according to the lowest computation\r\n  that can be made; and the Persons employed in it, are for the most\r\n  part Women and children who have no other means of Subsistence. The\r\n  English are now arrived to make as good Lace in Fineness and all other\r\n  respects, as any that is wrought in Flanders; and particularly since\r\n  the late Act so great an improvement is made that way that in\r\n  _Buckinghamshire_ the highest prized lace they used to make was about\r\n  eight shillings per yard, and now they make lace there of above thirty\r\n  shillings per yard and in Dorsetshire and Devonshire they now make\r\n  lace worth Six pound per yard and in other Places proportionable. The\r\n  Laws formerly made not proving effectual, one more strict passed 36\r\n  Years since in the 14th of King Charles II. which said Act recites\r\n  “That great numbers of the Inhabitants of this Kingdom were then\r\n  employed in making the said manufacture. Since that time the same has\r\n  encreased to a great Degree, till of late Years the Art of Smuggling\r\n  being grown to greater Perfection than formerly, larger quantities of\r\n  _Flanders_-lace have been clandestinely imported, which occasioned the\r\n  Enforcing of the former Prohibition Acts by a late one made in the\r\n  10th year of his Present Majesty.\r\n\r\n  Secondly, the Lace which used to come for England is but a small part\r\n  of their [Flanders] whole Lace-Trade, for they send it to Holland,\r\n  Germany, Sweden, Denmark, France, Spain, Portugal, etc., whereas we\r\n  make it chiefly to serve our own Country and Plantations.\r\n\r\n  ... The Lace Manufacture in England is the greatest next to the\r\n  Woollen and maintains a multitude of People, which otherwise the\r\n  Parishes must, and that would soon prove a heavy burthen, even to\r\n  those concerned in the Woollen Manufacture ... on the Resolution which\r\n  shall be taken in this affair depends the Well-being or ruin of\r\n  numerous families in their own Country. Many laws have been made to\r\n  set our Poor on Work and it is to be hoped none will be made to take\r\n  away work from Multitudes who are already Employed.”\r\n\r\nHere follows the numbers of the people in a few places which get their\r\nliving by making of lace. Those quoted in Devonshire as interesting to\r\ncompare with the present day are:—\r\n\r\n                Gittesham                           139\r\n                Culliton                            353\r\n                Coumbraleigh                         65\r\n                Northleigh                           32\r\n                Sidmouth                            302\r\n                Axmouth                              73\r\n                Sidbury                             321\r\n                Buckerall                            90\r\n                Farway                               70\r\n                Upotery                             118\r\n                Shut and Musbery                     25\r\n                Southley                             45\r\n                Fennyton                             60\r\n                Branscombe Beare and Seaton         326\r\n                Widworthy and Offerell              128\r\n                Broad Hembury                       118\r\n                Honyton                           1,341\r\n                Luppit                              215\r\n                Axminster                            60\r\n                Otrey St. Mary                      814\r\n                Shut and Musbery                     25\r\n\r\nThe Dragoons suppressing Monmouth’s Rebellion in 1680 are stated to have\r\ndespoiled the poor lacemakers greatly, and at Colyton broke into the\r\nhouse of a dealer in bone lace, Burd by name, and stole his goods to the\r\nvalue of £325.\r\n\r\nThe trade was still advancing when Defoe wrote in 1724:—\r\n\r\n  The valuable manufactures of Lace, for which the inhabitants of Devon\r\n  have long been conspicuous, are extending now from Exmouth to Torbay.\r\n\r\nLater still we find the people at Honiton make “the broadest sort that\r\nis made in England.”[20] Just previously, in 1753, the first prize was\r\nawarded by the Anti-Gallican Society, which encouraged home trade, to\r\nMrs. Lydia Maynard, of Honiton, “in token of six pairs of ladies’\r\nLappets of unprecedented beauty.” This date seems to have been the\r\nzenith of the lace prosperity, and reverses soon after set in.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  _Complete System of Geography._ Bowen, 1747.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTwo fires occurred in Honiton, causing much distress, and the second, in\r\n1765, was of so devastating a character that the town had to be rebuilt.\r\nShawe says, writing at the end of last century:—\r\n\r\n  For its present condition Honiton is indebted to that dreadful fire\r\n  which reduced three parts of it to ashes. The houses now wear a\r\n  pleasing aspect, and the principal street extending from East to West,\r\n  is paved in a remarkable manner, forming a canal, and well shouldered\r\n  up on each side with pebbles and green turf, which holds a stream of\r\n  clear water with a square dipping place opposite each door, a mark of\r\n  cleanliness and convenience I never saw before.\r\n\r\nThe American war had an evil effect upon the lace trade; still worse was\r\nthe French Revolution, and also the change of the fashion in dress; lace\r\nwas no longer used in profusion in the ladies’ wardrobe, and the demand\r\nfor it declined to a serious extent for the workers. Worse yet, however,\r\nwas the introduction of machine net, the first factory being set up at\r\nTiverton in 1815. Lysons[21] writes just afterwards:—\r\n\r\n  The manufactory of lace has much declined, although the lace still\r\n  retains its superiority. Some years ago, at which time it was much\r\n  patronized by the Royal Family, the manufactures of Honiton employed\r\n  2,400 hands in the town and in the neighbouring villages; they do not\r\n  now employ above 300. The lace here made had acquired some time ago\r\n  the name of Bath Brussels lace; but it is now generally known by its\r\n  original appellation of Honiton bone (or thread) lace. It has always\r\n  been manufactured from thread made at Antwerp; the present market\r\n  price of which is 70l. per lb.; an inferior lace is made in the\r\n  villages along the coast, of British thread, called Trolly lace.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  _Britannia_, 1822.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNo other reference to Bath Brussels lace is forthcoming; the reason of\r\nthe name Bath is not apparent. The thread seems always to have been and\r\nis still a difficulty to contend with in English lace. It seems\r\nimpossible to get the very fine, silky, pure flax thread in the home\r\nmarket. A greater part of the lace made at the present time is wasted\r\nlabour by reason of the coarse cottony thread used.\r\n\r\nThe evolution (if it may be termed so) of Honiton lace is briefly this.\r\nThe bone or bobbin lace before mentioned at first consisted of a small\r\nand simple imitation of the early Italian pillow laces—mere narrow\r\nstrips made by coarse threads plaited and interlaced. They got wider and\r\nmore elaborate as the workers gained experience. Specimens may be seen\r\non three Devonshire monuments of the first part of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Whether the lace of the district is imitated or not it is\r\nprobably similar to what would have been made there at that time. On the\r\neffigy of a Lady Pole in Colyton Church, her cape is edged with three\r\nrows of bone lace. Another, which is in excellent preservation, is on an\r\neffigy of Lady Dodderidge in Exeter Cathedral, her cuffs and tucker\r\nbeing a good pattern of geometric design. The third is on an effigy in\r\nCombe Martin Church, 1637.[22]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  There is an example of _opus araneum_ or _lacis_, net work embroidered\r\n  with a simple floral design, on the collar of Bp. Stafford, 1308, in\r\n  Exeter Cathedral.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBobbin laces soon became popular, as they were so much cheaper than the\r\nelaborate points; they became so eminently the speciality of Belgium as\r\nto make her the classic country of pillow work. Belgium was noted for\r\nher linens and delicately spun flax; in consequence, the Flemings\r\ndeparted from the style of their Italian masters, and made laces of\r\ntheir own fine threads; the fashion of wearing flat linen collars, in\r\nthe early part of the seventeenth century, encouraged the new style.\r\nThey worked out their own designs, and being fond of flowers, it\r\nnaturally came about they composed devices of blossoms and foliage.\r\n\r\nThese alterations, in course of time, found their way to England, there\r\nbeing much intercourse between their brethren here established and those\r\nremaining in Flanders. The lace continued to get finer and closer in\r\ntexture, the flax thread being required so fine that it became necessary\r\nto spin it in damp underground cellars. That the workers in England\r\ncould not compete successfully against the foreigner with their\r\nhome-made threads we find over and over again. They also altered the\r\nBrussels designs, and instead of the beautiful _fillings_ and openwork\r\nstitches substituted heavy guipure bars. The _vrai réseau_ or pillow net\r\nground succeeded the _bride_ towards the end of the seventeenth century.\r\nDuring the eighteenth century the flowers were made separately and\r\nworked in with the net afterwards, or rather the net was worked into the\r\nflowers on the pillow. The best _réseau_ was made by hand with the\r\nneedle, and was much more expensive. The advantages of making the net\r\nseparately soon declared themselves, and it formed an extensive branch\r\nof the trade. The mode of payment seems tedious but primitive in its\r\nsimplicity; the net was spread out on the dealer’s counter, and the\r\nworker covered it with shillings; as many as it took to cover it she had\r\nas the value of her work. “A piece bought previous to the introduction\r\nof machine net, 18 ins. square, cost £15. At the commencement of machine\r\nnet, in 1808, it could be bought for as many shillings, and in 1851 for\r\nas many pence.”[23]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  _Antique Point and Honiton Lace._ Mrs Treadwin. No date.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTrolly lace comes next in order; it was quite different from the Honiton\r\ntype, and resembled many of the laces made in the Midlands at the\r\npresent time. It was made with coarse British thread, heavier, larger\r\nbobbins, and worked straight on round the pillow. The origin was\r\nundoubtedly Flemish, but it is said to have reached Devonshire at the\r\ntime of the French Revolution through the Normandy peasants, driven by\r\nwant of employment from their own country, where lace was a great\r\nindustry in the eighteenth century. Be this as it may, lappets and\r\nscarves were certainly made of Trolly lace at an earlier date; Mrs.\r\nDelaney, in one of her letters (1756) speaks of a “trolly head.” Trolly\r\nlace, before its downfall, has been sold at the extravagant price of\r\nfive guineas a yard.[24] The origin of _Trolly_ is from the Flemish\r\n_Trolle Kant_, where the design was outlined with a thick thread.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  _History of Lace._ Mrs. Palliser, 1901.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe most startling change in the lace industry occurred after 1816, when\r\nthe introduction of machine net caused the _vrai réseau_ to go out of\r\nfashion. The cheap mechanical net took the place of the hand-made\r\nground, throwing hundreds of hands out of work in a few years, and\r\nupsetting the social economy of the district. Application on machine net\r\nbecame universal, and the prices decreasing, the workers lost heart, and\r\ngave up their good old patterns, taking to inventions out of their\r\nheads, and frequently down to the present time copying some frightful\r\ndesign from a wall paper!\r\n\r\nQueen Adelaide, in answer to a petition sent up by the lace makers,\r\nordered a dress made of Honiton sprigs on machine net, in which every\r\nflower was to be copied from nature. It was executed at Honiton.[25] The\r\nbridal dress of Queen Victoria, which she ordered from Devonshire, was\r\ncarried out at Beer, and cost £1,000. It was made in the _guipure_\r\nfashion, the sprigs being connected by openwork stitches on the pillow.\r\nThe trade from that time revived, as lace came once more into fashion,\r\nthe _guipure_ being the description made, the sections of the pattern\r\nunited on the pillow, or sewn on to paper and joined by the needle with\r\nthe various lace stitches; _purling_ is made by the yard, for the edge.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  Queen Adelaide also caused to be introduced the Maltese lace, that\r\n  continued to be made for years here and there.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe lace schools of this time were a great feature, there being many in\r\nevery village, and as few other schools existed, boys in addition to the\r\ngirls of the place attended and learnt the industry.[26] The usual mode\r\nof procedure was this. The children commenced attending at the age of\r\nfive to seven, and were apprenticed to the mistress for an average of\r\ntwo years, who sold all their work for her trouble; they then paid 6d. a\r\nweek for a time, and had their own lace, then 3d., and so on according\r\nto the amount of teaching they still required. The young children went\r\nfirst from 10 to 12 in the morning to accustom them to work by degrees.\r\nAt Honiton the full hours were 8 to 8 in the summer and in the depth of\r\nwinter, but in spring and autumn less on account of the light; as\r\ncandles were used only from nutting day, the 3rd of September, till\r\nShrove Tide. The old rhyme runs:—\r\n\r\n  Be the Shrove Tide high or low Out the candle we will blow.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Treadwin in her younger days saw some twenty-four men lace makers\r\n  in Woodbury, one of whom had worked at his pillow so late as 1820.\r\n  From being taught as boys, the sailors used to employ themselves in\r\n  the winter making some of the coarse laces.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAt Sidbury it was _de rigeur_ that directly a girl married, however\r\nyoung, she wore a cap; but till then the lace-makers were famous for\r\ntheir good hair being beautifully dressed. When school began they stood\r\nup in a circle to read the “Verses”; if any one read “jokily” they were\r\ngiven a penalty, and likewise for idleness—so much extra work. In nearly\r\nall schools they were taught reading from the Bible, and in some they\r\nlearnt writing.\r\n\r\nThe Honiton pillows run rather smaller than those for Buckingham lace,\r\nand do not have the multiplicity of starched coverings—only three “pill\r\ncloths” over the top, and another each side of the lace in progress; two\r\npieces of horn, called “sliders,” go between to take the weight of the\r\nbobbins from dragging the stitches in progress; a small square\r\npincushion is on one side, and stuck into the pillow is the “needle\r\npin,” a large sewing needle in a wooden handle, used for picking up\r\nloops through which the bobbins or “sticks” are placed. These last are\r\nmostly turned box-wood, small and light, and no coloured beads or\r\n“gingles” at the end, as that would make them too heavy for the fine\r\nthreads. Some of them are of great age. Mrs. Treadwin found an old\r\nlace-maker using a lace “turn” for winding sticks, having the date of\r\n1678 rudely carved on the foot.\r\n\r\nThe pillow has to be frequently turned round in the course of the work,\r\nso no stand is used, and it is rested against a table or doorway, or\r\nformerly, in the golden days, in fine weather there would be rows of\r\nworkers sitting outside their cottages resting their “pills” against the\r\nback of the chair in front.\r\n\r\nEver since the Great Exhibition of 1851 drew attention to the industry,\r\nsomeone or some society has been trying to encourage better design and\r\nbetter manufacture; but the majority of the people have sought for a\r\nlivelihood by meeting the demand for cheap and shoddy articles—that\r\ndreadful bane of modern times. Good patterns, good thread, good work,\r\nhave been thrown aside, the workers and small dealers recking little of\r\nthe fact that they themselves were ruining the trade as much as\r\nmachinery; tarnishing the fair name of Honiton throughout the world\r\namong those able to appreciate a beautiful art. Fortunately there were\r\nsome able to lead in the right path, and all honour must be given to\r\nLady Trevelyan, who, at Seaton and Beer, about 1850–70, designed and\r\nsuperintended the working of naturalistic flowers and sprays; also to\r\nMrs. Treadwin at Exeter, who started reproducing old laces, and with her\r\nworkers turned out excellent copies of old Venetian rose-point,\r\nValenciennes, or Flemish. Mrs. Treadwin was a woman of culture and taste\r\nwho had the best interests of the trade at heart.\r\n\r\nIn the present work there is a straining after novelty with no capable\r\ndesigners at the helm. We ought, as a national duty, to encourage to our\r\nutmost any industry that can be worked in the rural districts. Let the\r\nEducation Authorities frankly acknowledge that our Art Schools cannot\r\nturn out lace designers, and import one of our clever French neighbours\r\nto help the Devonian workers. It would, after all, only be a case of\r\n_L’histoire se répète toujours_ since the days of Benedict Biscop, who\r\nimported vestments which gave the English their first lesson in\r\nembroidery.\r\n\r\n                                                       ALICE DRYDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         “THE BLOODY ELEVENTH”;\r\n                     WITH NOTES ON COUNTY DEFENCE.\r\n\r\n                     BY LIEUT.-COL. P. F. S. AMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Devonshire Regiment, of which the Haytors now form a battalion, was\r\nraised so far back as 1685, has seen a vast amount of service, and has\r\never served with distinction before the enemy in the two centuries of\r\nits history. During the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth, in 1685, many\r\nnew corps were raised, and among them a regiment of musketeers and\r\npikemen by the Duke of Beaufort. It was composed of loyal men of Devon,\r\nSomerset, and Dorset, and was known as “The Duke of Beaufort’s\r\nMusketeers.” In the same year, after the rebellion had been crushed at\r\nSedgemoor, the Duke resigned the colonelcy to his son, the Marquis of\r\nWorcester. At that time regiments were named after their colonels. The\r\ncorps was distinguished by tawny-coloured ribbons in their hats, scarlet\r\ncoats lined with tawny-coloured shalloon, tawny-coloured breeches,\r\nstockings, and sashes. Lord Worcester was succeeded in 1687 by Lord\r\nMontgomery, who was devoted to the interests of James II. In 1688 the\r\nregiment was in garrison at Hull, when the Prince of Orange landed at\r\nTorbay. The Governor of Hull was also a supporter of James. The\r\nregiment, however, led by its Lieutenant-Colonel, Sir John Hanmer,\r\ndeclared with the inhabitants of Hull for the Prince of Orange and the\r\nProtestant party. Sir John Hanmer was made Colonel, and in 1689 took\r\npart with his regiment in the famous relief of Londonderry. In 1690 it\r\nserved under the eye of William III. at the Battle of the Boyne, where\r\nit repulsed three cavalry charges and materially assisted to secure the\r\nProtestant succession. In 1707, under Colonel Hill, it was present at\r\nthe terrible battle of Almanza, in Portugal, where, after performing\r\ndeeds of valour, it was overpowered and cut to pieces. Twenty-six\r\nofficers and nearly all the men were killed, wounded, or taken. In 1709\r\nit served under Marlborough in the Netherlands, took part in the siege\r\nof Mons, where it greatly distinguished itself in repulsing a sortie, in\r\nwhich ten officers and 150 men were lost. In 1715, under Colonel\r\nMontague, it took part against the rebellion under the Earl of Mar in\r\nScotland, and at the battle of Dunblane lost eight officers and 108 men.\r\nIn 1738, Colonel Cornwallis was appointed, and as Cornwallis’ regiment\r\ntook part in the war of Austrian succession. It was present at the\r\nbattle of Dettingen, in 1743, where George II. in person commanded the\r\narmy, and received a French cavalry charge in line. Cornwallis’ and\r\nanother battalion executed a difficult manœuvre, which brought the\r\nenemy’s cavalry under fire. The name of Dettingen is borne on the\r\ncolours. In 1745, at Fontenoy, it again broke through the French lines,\r\nand almost secured victory; its losses were seven officers and 212 men.\r\nIt was re-called to England during the Pretender’s rebellion in\r\nScotland, and sent again into the Low Countries in 1746, where, as\r\nGraham’s regiment, it took a prominent and honourable part in the\r\ndesperate battle of Roucoux against the renowned Marshal Saxe, where it\r\nlost twelve officers and 206 men.\r\n\r\n1st July, 1751.—A royal warrant was issued, regulating the clothing and\r\ncolours of every regiment. It was now numbered as 11th Regiment of Foot,\r\nand the “facings spoken of as being green,” but when they were changed\r\nfrom tawny is not known. The drummers were clothed in green, faced with\r\nred. 1756.—The strength was increased to twenty companies, which were\r\ndivided into two battalions. 1758.—The second battalion was constituted\r\nthe Sixty-fourth Regiment, illustrating the birth of new regiments. The\r\n11th took part in the Seven Years’ War, 1760 to 1763, under the Prince\r\nof Brunswick. In 1782 county titles were given to regiments in order to\r\nfacilitate recruiting, and the 11th was designated the “North Devon\r\nRegiment,” and the officers were enjoined to cultivate an intercourse\r\nwith that part of the county, so as to create a mutual attachment\r\nbetween the inhabitants and the regiment. Exactly a century afterwards\r\nsimilar orders and changes took place for a like purpose. In 1793, when\r\nEngland was threatened with invasion by the French Republic, and\r\nvolunteers were being drilled, the 11th was defending Toulon against\r\nNapoleon. It was evacuated after a gallant defence by twelve thousand\r\nmen of five different nations, over a line of outposts extending fifteen\r\nmiles in circumference, against an army of between thirty and forty\r\nthousand men. The 11th formed part of the garrison under Lord Mulgrave,\r\nand distinguished itself in several sorties, especially that on 30th\r\nNovember, 1793, when the French were driven from their batteries and\r\nguns spiked. In this affair, Napoleon Bonaparte, then an artillery\r\nofficer, received a bayonet wound in his thigh. Thus the first contact\r\nthe future Emperor made with a British battalion was with our Devon\r\nRegiment; and he did not again come face to face with us until the\r\nBattle of Waterloo, although he is said to have watched some of the\r\nbattles in the Pyrenees from a distance. In 1798, it was sent to Ostend\r\non a very hazardous expedition to cut the Great Canal; it did its work,\r\nbut was unable to re-embark owing to a storm, and 24 officers and 456\r\nmen were captured. In 1800, the 11th was sent to the West Indies, took\r\npart in the capture of St. Bartholomew, St. Martin’s, St. Thomas, St.\r\nJohn, and Santa Cruz; in 1807 to Madeira. In 1808, a second battalion\r\nwas again added, which formed a part of the Walcheren expedition in\r\n1809. At the taking of Flushing they took a set of brass drums belonging\r\nto the 11th French Regiment, and enlisted the musicians of a Prussian\r\nband serving in the French army, when all the men joined with their\r\ninstruments. In 1810 and 1811, they took part in the Peninsula War. On\r\n22nd July, 1812, the regiment won glory at the decisive battle of\r\nSalamanca, which led to the French being driven out of Spain. The 11th,\r\n53rd, and 61st Regiments formed a brigade in the Sixth Division,\r\ncommanded by Major-General Clinton. Lord Wellington had noticed that in\r\nmanœuvring his troops the French marshal had so extended his forces as\r\nto be unable to support each other. To take advantage of this mistake,\r\nthe 11th, as leading its brigade, was pushed forward under a heavy fire,\r\nand was soon engaged in a desperate struggle, and drove the French from\r\ntheir ground. At the close of the action a French division made a very\r\ndetermined stand to recover the retreat. The 6th British Division again\r\nattacked, led by the 11th, and as the darkness came on overpowered the\r\nFrench, who fled in confusion. They lost 16 officers, 325 men; only 4\r\nofficers and 67 men came out unwounded. The 11th captured a battery of\r\nguns and a green standard without an eagle. The 122nd French Regiment,\r\nwhich was opposed to the 11th with two battalions, numbering 2,200\r\nstrong, the next day only mustered 200 men; they were mostly taken\r\nprisoners. Captain Lord Clinton, uncle of our late Lord Lieutenant, was\r\ndespatched with the news direct from the field, and carried with him the\r\ngreen standard. He landed at Plymouth, and in a chaise and four rattled\r\nup the road to London. As he passed through the towns on the way he\r\nexhibited the standard, and persons now living in Ashburton remember\r\nseeing him pass through; he was at that time Lord of the Borough of\r\nAshburton. The 11th earned the nickname of “The Bloody Eleventh” from\r\nthe part it had taken in that terrible day. It suffered severely in the\r\nbattles in the Pyrenees and following movements, which resulted in\r\ndriving the French across the frontier. It was not present at Waterloo,\r\nand in 1816 the Second Battalion was disbanded at Gibraltar, the men\r\nbeing incorporated in the First Battalion. In 1825, new colours were\r\npresented to the regiment whilst at Cork, on which were added the names\r\nof the Peninsula battles. During the years of peace it moved from\r\nstation to station, and was not in the Crimea. During the Indian Mutiny\r\na Second Battalion was again raised, but did not take part. In\r\n1879–1880, the 11th took part in the Afghan War; in 1881, the regiment\r\nceased to be the 11th and became the “Devonshire Regiment,” but the\r\ngreen facings were changed to white, in common with other line\r\nregiments, and are alone borne by the junior battalion, viz., the Haytor\r\nVolunteer Battalion. The Devonshire Territorial Regiment now consists of\r\ntwo line battalions for foreign service, two militia battalions, five\r\nvolunteer battalions, of which the 1st and 2nd are rifles, total nine.\r\n\r\nThe reformation and development of the volunteer force in the middle and\r\nlatter half of the nineteenth century, with its embodiment into the\r\nterritorial line regiments, has tended to increase the local _esprit de\r\ncorps_ throughout the kingdom, and especially in Devon, where the\r\nmovement had its birth. A short sketch of the formation and growth of\r\nthe volunteers in Devon will, therefore, not only be of local interest,\r\nbut will be an illustration of the steps taken in times of danger for\r\nthe defence of our shores in the times of our grandfathers, and\r\ncontinued through the years of peace under our late imperial Sovereign,\r\nQueen Victoria.\r\n\r\nPlymouth and its immediate neighbourhood is the cradle in which the\r\nspirit of volunteer defence has been nurtured; frequently before the\r\nsixteenth century have French and Spaniards made or attempted landings\r\nthere for pillage or destruction, but in each case they suffered\r\nseverely from the resolute resistance of the townspeople. In the Civil\r\nWar the inhabitants formed themselves into trained bands and resisted\r\nthe Royalist siege. In 1745, when Prince Charlie, the young Pretender,\r\nlanded in Scotland and gained the battle of Prestonpans, Plymouth again\r\nraised a body of volunteers; and in 1759, when France determined on a\r\ndescent on England and had 18,000 men ready to embark on board the\r\nFrench fleet, Plymouth again raised two companies of volunteers to\r\nstrengthen the militia, one of which undertook to clothe and feed\r\nitself. The destruction of the French fleet by Admiral Hawke, at the\r\nmouth of Quiberon Bay, and the decisive battle of Minden, where the\r\n20th, or East Devon Regiment, learned its celebrated “Minden Yell,”\r\nremoved for a time the fear of French invasion. When, therefore, in\r\n1779, the combined fleets of France and Spain held for a time the\r\npossession of the English Channel, and the gallant Elliot was holding\r\nthe rock of Gibraltar against famine and bombardment, and most of our\r\narmy was fighting in America, the Spanish and French fleets suddenly\r\nappeared off Plymouth, causing great alarm for the safety of the\r\ndockyard and the numerous French prisoners in the port, the inhabitants\r\nwere again ready to enroll themselves. Mr. William Bastard, of Kitley,\r\nthe great grandfather of the present Mr. B. J. B. Bastard, the first\r\nLieutenant-Colonel of the Haytor Volunteer battalion, offered to raise a\r\nforce of 500 men as a corps of Fencibles, and in two days had 1,500\r\nyoung men to select from, who wished for the honour of serving under\r\nhim. On 23rd August, 1779, he escorted 1,300 war prisoners to Exeter for\r\nsafety, and on the 25th delivered them to the commanding officer there,\r\nand at once returned with his regiment to Plymouth. I have been unable\r\nto find any traditions of this march preserved in the towns through\r\nwhich they must have passed, but we may be sure at the time it caused\r\nmuch excitement along the road and at the places they rested the two\r\nnights. The whole of this eventful period at Plymouth is well described\r\nby Miss Peard in her charming little book, _Mother Molly_. The example\r\nof Plymouth was followed by the citizens of Exeter, who also raised a\r\nVolunteer corps. For these services the King, on the 24th September,\r\nsigned a warrant for a baronetcy for Mr. Bastard, who, however, modestly\r\ndeclined the honour. The supremacy in the Channel was soon restored by\r\nthe return of the fleet, and the victories of Admiral Rodney rendered\r\nour shores safe for a time.\r\n\r\nIn 1794, the effects of the French Revolution had made themselves felt\r\nin England, and several elaborate plots were formed to supersede\r\nParliament by a National Convention after the French model, and to\r\nabolish the Monarchy. Great distress prevailed in the country, which\r\nalways forms the best weapon of revolutionists. The rate of interest\r\nrose to seventeen per cent.; the Bank of England only saved itself by\r\nthe suspension of cash payment. Monge, the French Minister of Marine,\r\nthreatened to land in England with 50,000 red caps of liberty, and to\r\noverthrow the Government of the country.\r\n\r\nIt was at this crisis that the Government called on the different\r\ncounties to take steps for the defence of the kingdom, and a meeting of\r\nmagistrates was called by Lord Fortescue, the Lord Lieutenant, and\r\npresided over by the High Sheriff, J. S. Pode, Esq., on the 22nd April,\r\n1794. 1795, 7th January, returns showed two troops of cavalry and\r\ntwenty-three companies of infantry to have been raised and equipped by\r\nsubscription. March 23rd, the Lord Lieutenant, Earl Fortescue, ordered\r\nmonthly returns from each corps. 7th April, 1795, the twelve corps in\r\nthe eastern part of the county were formed into a battalion, under Col.\r\nMackenzie. 2nd June, Colonel Orchard, of Hartland Abbey, reported that\r\nhe had inspected his own regiment, viz., corps at Fremington, Westleigh,\r\nNortham, Hartland, and two companies at Bideford. This appears to be the\r\nsix western companies of the north battalion. 1796 returns showed two\r\ntroops of cavalry, twenty-two companies of infantry—1,651 men. In this\r\nyear an attempt was made by the French to land in Bantry Bay, which,\r\nhowever, failed, and the expedition was glad to get back to Brest, with\r\nthe loss of four ships of the line and eight frigates. Early in 1797,\r\nanother expedition, under Tate, appeared in the Bristol Channel, off\r\nIlfracombe, with the intention of burning Bristol. The North Devon\r\nVolunteers turned out with great zeal, and were prepared to dispute the\r\nlanding on their coast. The French, however, turned northward and landed\r\nin Wales, where they soon surrendered to a far inferior force of\r\nmilitia, yeomanry, and volunteers, commanded by Lord Cawdor, and\r\nsupported by a reserve of Welsh women in red cloaks. 1798 saw the nation\r\nin the most serious crisis of its history. The French Directory having\r\nmade terms with the European powers, were able to turn all their\r\nattention to the invasion and conquest of the British Isles. Former\r\nexpeditions were designed to stir up the disloyal and assist them to\r\noverthrow the Government, but now a French army was to land on our\r\nshores. The Spanish and Dutch fleets had been pressed into the French\r\nservice, but British courage and seamanship had effectually disposed of\r\nthem in the great naval battles of St. Vincent and Camperdown.\r\nNevertheless, an army was organized, named the Army of England, and\r\ndistributed along the French coast in readiness for embarkation.\r\nFlat-bottomed boats were prepared for landing troops and for service on\r\nour rivers. The bankers of Paris were called upon to advance a loan on\r\nthe security of English property. The greatest calamity, however, was a\r\ngeneral mutiny in the Channel Fleet at the Nore, which expelled their\r\nofficers, elected their own admiral and captains, hoisted the red flag,\r\nand blockaded the mouth of the Thames; they seriously discussed the\r\nexpediency of making the whole over to the French. If England could not\r\ndepend on her fleet she must fall. Had not prompt measures been taken\r\nand the mutiny quelled, invasion on a large scale would certainly have\r\ntaken place. To add to these troubles a formidable rebellion broke out\r\nin Ireland, and its leaders arranged for the support of the French army,\r\nunder Hocke, a general of great experience. A brigade of 1,000 men\r\nactually landed in Ireland, under General Humbert, beat the local\r\ntroops, and advanced into the country, but were compelled to surrender\r\nto Lord Cornwallis; and Admiral Warren caught a French fleet with 3,000\r\ntroops on their way to support them, and only one of the nine ships\r\nreturned to France. Such being the state of public affairs, it cannot be\r\ndenied that our great grandparents had good grounds for alarm. There is\r\nhardly a district or family in Devon but has some tradition of that\r\nperiod. Nervous people were afraid to take off their clothes at night.\r\nOld gentlemen provided themselves with hollow walking-sticks filled with\r\nguineas to carry with them in their flight. At Totnes my\r\ngreat-grandfather’s family permanently engaged a post-chaise in which\r\nthe women and children might escape to Bristol; the family plate was\r\npacked ready to be taken off, and a belt of guineas provided. The\r\nschoolboys enjoyed it, for there was no school, as the seniors were too\r\nmuch engaged in obtaining and discussing news to attend to them. The\r\nsaying still exists at Totnes, “Going to Paignton to meet the French,”\r\nfor “meeting trouble half-way.” Beacon fires were prepared to spread the\r\nnews of any landing. A story is told of a tramp at Dawlish who, in\r\nlighting his pipe, set a hay rick on fire; the watchers at the nearest\r\nbeacon took it for a signal of an invasion, and lighted their fires,\r\nwhich were answered in every direction, and the people sprang to arms\r\nuntil “That time of slumber was as bright and busy as the day.” One old\r\nsailor, however, had his wits about him, when his daughter shook him out\r\nof a deep sleep with the news that the French had landed. Rubbing his\r\neyes, he told her to go and look at the weather-cock. She came back\r\nsaying the wind was from the north. “I thought so,” said he, “and so it\r\nwas yesterday. The French can’t land with this wind.” And so the ancient\r\nmariner turned round and went to sleep again.\r\n\r\nThe next place in the history of volunteers was the extension of the\r\narea of their service. Up to this date the condition of service was\r\nconfined to the county of Devon, and in the case of the early Exeter\r\ncorps to the defence of the city only. The military authorities saw the\r\nimpossibility of mobilising the volunteers, even to a small extent, who\r\nhad enlisted under these conditions. The County Committee were,\r\ntherefore, instructed to accept no offers except for service throughout\r\nthe military district. It was, however, ultimately arranged for all\r\nvolunteers to accept the new conditions, but cities or large towns\r\nshould be allowed to maintain a local corps composed of respectable\r\nhouseholders only, to aid the civil power to protect property. Most of\r\nthe corps appear to have been willing to extend their services to the\r\nmilitary district. In January, 1799, it was resolved that no further\r\noffers should be accepted. Each parish was required to appoint a man and\r\nhorse to act as guide. The battle of the Nile and the extinction of the\r\nIrish rebellion seem to have quieted men’s minds for a time. But in\r\nApril Devonshire was again astir, for the Committee of Secrecy of the\r\nHouse of Commons reported that undoubted intelligence had been received\r\nthat plans of an invasion and insurrection in Ireland were being made in\r\nFrance. That the utmost diligence was being observed in the ports of\r\nFrance in preparing another expedition to co-operate with the rebels in\r\nIreland, that it was intended at the same time to land a French force at\r\ndifferent parts of the coast. That the instructions to Tate, who was\r\ntaken prisoner in Wales in 1797, and those of General Humbert, who\r\nlanded in Ireland, and who had been destined to command an expedition\r\nagainst Cornwall, had fallen into the hands of the Government, and were\r\nas follows:—The legion was to land in Cornwall and to cross the Tamar as\r\nquickly as possible, and to establish itself in the district between it\r\nand the Exe, or, as we should say, in the South Hams. The “passes and\r\nmountains” (Dartmoor) would afford an easy and safe retreat from the\r\npursuit of the enemy. Thus Dartmoor was selected both by the French\r\nDirectory and by the English officers for a place of refuge. There,\r\nindeed, in the Dartmoor prisons, many French soldiers and sailors were\r\ndestined to find a safe retreat.\r\n\r\nBut as time went on, and no invasion took place, things became quieter;\r\nthe Defence Committee seldom met; the volunteers, however, continued to\r\ndrill and to hold reviews.\r\n\r\nIn 1801, the separate corps were consolidated into battalions and\r\nregiments. The two 1st Devon troops of cavalry, with those at Bicton,\r\nTiverton, and Cullompton, united in the “Royal 1st Devon Yeomanry\r\nCavalry,” under Lord Rolle as Colonel, Sir Stafford Northcote as\r\nLieutenant-Colonel. The North Devon Corps of Infantry became the 3rd\r\nNorth Devon Regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Fortescue. The Loyal\r\nExminster Hundred Regiment of Volunteers, under Lord Courtenay, was\r\nsimilarly formed. In 1802 came the “Peace of Amiens,” or, as it is\r\nfrequently called, the “Cloamen Peace.” It was a fragile, patched up\r\naffair, by which Bonaparte gained breathing time. “It was a peace\r\neveryone was glad of and nobody proud of.” Volunteer affairs became\r\nquiet, many corps were disbanded, among them the Ashburton Sergebacks.\r\nOld soldiers were discharged from the line regiments, and militiamen\r\nsent to their homes.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1803, Bonaparte suddenly declared war, and then, as Emperor,\r\nprepared in earnest to invade England. A camp of 100,000 men was formed\r\non the cliffs at Boulogne, and a host of flat-bottomed boats gathered\r\nfor their conveyance across the Channel. At last the Emperor Napoleon\r\nappeared in camp; all was ready. “_Let us be masters of the Channel for\r\nsix hours_,” he is reported to have said, “_and we are masters of the\r\nworld._” But he never was able to be master of the Channel for six\r\nhours. The army waited and drilled, the old Bayeaux tapestry, which\r\nillustrates the conquest of England by William of Normandy, was searched\r\nout to create enthusiasm, and show what had once been done; all kinds of\r\nschemes were resorted to to obtain the naval assistance of other\r\nnations, and with success, for the Spanish fleet joined him. Still, the\r\nEnglish fleet, under Lord Nelson, held the Channel, but any accident\r\nmight give the six hours’ mastery, and so England had to be prepared.\r\nThe County Defence Committee again assumed the direction of affairs. The\r\narrangements made in 1798 were once more put in force. It was in 1803\r\nthat the Haytor Regiment was formed, and commanded by Lord Seymour; it\r\nwas 1,000 strong, with 250 artillery attached, and appears to have been\r\nmade up of all the volunteers in the Haytor Hundred with those of\r\nseveral towns and parishes adjoining. Newton Abbot was the headquarters,\r\nwhere Captain Babb, afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel Babb, was captain. In\r\nthe former arming of 1798 Ashburton had formed the 9th Devon Corps,\r\nunder Captain Walter Palk; they had clothed themselves with local-made\r\nserge, and so gained the name of Sergebacks; they were disbanded at the\r\nPeace of Amiens, but now again formed and became a company in the Haytor\r\nRegiment, under Captain Tozer. Bridgetown, being in Berry Pomeroy\r\nparish, also was in the Haytor district. Mr. Milford Windeatt, a\r\nrelative of the present Captain Windeatt, held a commission in the\r\nHaytor Corps. Totnes, however, formed a separate corps, being in the\r\nStanborough Hundred, as did also Highweek, Kingsteignton, Chudleigh, and\r\nBovey Tracey, which were in Teignbridge. The Stanborough Regiment, in\r\nwhich Kingsbridge formed a part, was connected with Plymouth. Torquay,\r\nPaignton, and Brixham supplied artillery men under Colonel Cary, of Tor\r\nAbbey. For the protection of Tor Bay the authorities garrisoned Berry\r\nHead, which, being in the Haytor Hundred, was committed to a detachment\r\nof the regiment under Colonel Cary. Many stories remain of this period\r\nof service. I cannot say how long the volunteers were out; probably they\r\nrelieved each other. One story frequently told was of the French\r\nfire-ships, for which they were on the lookout, to be sent among the\r\nfleet in the bay, and which caused much stir. One night, as the full\r\nmoon rose red and fiery out of the sea, the sentry at the headland, who\r\nhad come from an inland parish, mistook it for a fire ship, discharged\r\nhis musket, and aroused the garrison. The uniform was similar to the\r\nline regiments of the period, viz., scarlet swallow-tailed coats, turned\r\nout with yellow, blue-black breeches, white cross belts, with a brass\r\nplate having Haytor Regiment thereon; the pouches were black, the\r\nbuttons had H.V.R. (Haytor Volunteer Regiment); officers wore cocked\r\nhats, others tall shakoes. The regiment assembled for field days and\r\ndrill at various points in the district. Lord Clifford has a plan of a\r\nsham fight on Bovey-heathfield, but the movements appear to have been\r\nvery simple. Lieutenant-Colonel Babb, whose tablet is in Wolborough\r\nChurch, Newton Abbot, commanded the regiment at one time. On 21st\r\nOctober, 1805, Lord Nelson caught the combined French and Spanish fleet\r\noff Cape Trafalgar. His last and famous signal, “England expects every\r\nman to do his duty,” was observed and obeyed, and although he fell in\r\nthe hour of victory, twenty battleships had struck their flags ere the\r\nday was done. Pitt explained, in his last public words, “England has\r\nsaved herself by her courage; she will save England by her example.” The\r\ncrisis had again passed, England could breathe freely once more, still\r\nthe volunteers were kept enrolled for a time. The Haytors were disbanded\r\nabout 1809, and the old colours laid up in Wolborough Church until time\r\nhad consumed them. The time of peace continued for about forty years,\r\nuntil the Crimean War, in 1853, left the country almost without troops\r\nto garrison her arsenals. Then several Volunteer corps were raised,\r\namong them the “Exeter and South Devon,” under Colonel Sir Edmund\r\nPrideaux. At the peace in 1856 it was not disbanded, but remained\r\nembodied until the memorable circular of 12th May, 1859, in which the\r\nSecretary of State for War suggested the formation of Volunteer corps\r\nthroughout the country as a means of preventing the frequent war scares\r\ncaused by the uncertain actions of the French under Napoleon III. The\r\nExeter corps then became the first in the kingdom, and through them\r\nDevonshire stands at the top in the precedence of the counties. On 24th\r\nMay, 1859, the Plymouth corps was formed, but the date of its acceptance\r\nwas later on. The movement had life because it was in accordance with\r\nthe feelings of the people, which was shown by almost every town in\r\nDevon holding meetings for the purpose of forming corps, and persons of\r\nevery social position offered their services, and in a large proportion\r\nundertook their own outfits. These offers were mostly accepted by Her\r\nMajesty; each corps became an independent body, and was numbered in the\r\norder in which they were accepted, but joined into administrative\r\nbattalions for drill purposes. In 1880, the administrative battalions\r\nwere consolidated into corps, which in 1885 were incorporated as\r\nvolunteer battalions of the county regiment, of which they have since\r\nformed a part, and in the South African war sent two companies, fully\r\nofficered and equipped, to the front. This brings us to the eve of the\r\nproposed changes in the constitution of our army and military system,\r\nand possibly the close of the volunteer system as we have known it.\r\n\r\n                   “The brave old men of Devonshire!\r\n                     ’Tis worth the world to stand,\r\n                   As Devon’s sons, on Devon’s soil,\r\n                     Though juniors of the band;\r\n                   And tell Old England to her ace,\r\n                     If she is great in fame,\r\n                   ’Twas good old hearts of Devon oak\r\n                     That made her glorious name.”\r\n                                    P. F. S. AMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      JACK RATTENBURY, THE ROB ROY\r\n                              OF THE WEST.\r\n\r\n                           BY MAXWELL ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Rattenbury—or, as he is commonly called, the “Rob Roy of the\r\nWest”—was born at Beer in 1788. His father was a shoemaker by trade, but\r\nbefore his son John was born, he went to sea on board a man-of-war, and\r\nwas never again heard of. His mother supported herself by selling fish,\r\nwhile Jack was allowed to run wild, spending his time chiefly at the\r\nwater-side, where he acquired a taste for the sea and for those daring\r\nadventures which made him subsequently so notorious. When about nine\r\nyears of age, he induced his uncle, who was a fisherman, to take him\r\nwith him in his fishing expeditions. This was the beginning of his sea\r\ntraining, and continued for some time, until one day, being left in\r\ncharge of the boat, while his uncle was on shore at Lyme, he lost her\r\nrudder. For this negligence his uncle chastised him with a rope’s end,\r\nwhereupon a separation ensued. Jack then joined a Brixham fisherman as\r\nan apprentice, but after a space of twelve months, finding this\r\noccupation uncongenial, he engaged himself to the master of a coasting\r\nvessel of Bridport, trading between that port and Dartmouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “JACK” RATTENBURY.\r\n  (_From a Lithograph by W. Bevan._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nAbout this time war broke out between England and France, and fearing\r\nthe press-gang, he returned to Beer. There he found his uncle engaged in\r\ncollecting men for privateering, an enterprise which appealed to his\r\nroving spirit, and joining the crew, he, with twenty-two others, was\r\nconveyed to Torquay and put on board the _Dover_, commanded by Captain\r\nMatthews. In due course the _Dover_ was ready for sea, and in March,\r\n1792, started for her first cruise off the Western Islands. He thus\r\ndescribes his feelings on this occasion:—\r\n\r\n  And even now, notwithstanding the lapse of years, I can recall the\r\n  triumph and exultation which rushed through my veins, as I saw the\r\n  shores of my native country recede, and the vast ocean opening before\r\n  me; I was like a bird which had escaped from the confinement of the\r\n  cage, and obtained the liberty after which it panted. I thought on\r\n  some who had risen from the lowest to the highest posts, from the\r\n  cabin boy to the admiral’s flag. I wished to make a figure on the\r\n  stage of life, and my hopes and expectations were restless and\r\n  boundless, like the element around me.\r\n\r\nThe privateering enterprise, however, does not appear to have been very\r\nsuccessful. After cruising about the Western Islands for several weeks\r\nwithout meeting with any adventure worth relating, the _Dover_ at last\r\nfell in with three American merchant ships laden with French goods, but\r\nas their commanders contended that they were not lawful prizes, they\r\nwere allowed to go. It transpired later on that these very vessels were\r\nafterwards taken by an English cruiser. Not long after, the _Dover_ was\r\ncaptured by a French ship, and the crew, including John Rattenbury, were\r\ntaken to Bordeaux and confined in the prison of that place. He does not\r\nappear to have been badly treated by his jailers, and he was allowed a\r\ncertain amount of liberty, which enabled him to make the acquaintance of\r\nthe master of an American vessel, then lying in Bordeaux harbour,\r\nCaptain Prowse by name, who, taking a liking to the lad, allowed him to\r\nconceal himself on board his ship. It was, however, more than twelve\r\nmonths before the vessel was allowed to leave the port in consequence of\r\nan embargo on all foreign shipping, when, having taken in a cargo of\r\nwine, etc., it was cleared for New York, which port was reached after a\r\npassage of forty-five days. Here Rattenbury engaged himself as cook and\r\ncabin boy on board a ship sailing for Havre de Grâce. On arrival there\r\nhe was anxious to get home again. He therefore transferred himself to an\r\nAmerican merchantman belonging to Boston named the _Grand Turk_, bound\r\nfor London, as he supposed, but much to his disappointment it proceeded\r\nto Copenhagen instead. He returned in her to Havre de Grâce, and thence\r\nafter sundry adventures found himself in Guernsey, where, to his\r\ndelight, he met his uncle, who took him back to Beer.\r\n\r\nHe was now sixteen years of age, and remained quietly at home for six\r\nmonths, part of which time he spent in fishing. After the roving life he\r\nhad led, he found this occupation most uncongenial, and the smuggling\r\ntrade, which was then being plied very briskly in the neighbourhood,\r\noffering great inducements, he determined to try his fortune at it. He\r\naccordingly joined a vessel engaged in this trade between Lyme and the\r\nChannel Islands, but after four months he engaged on another vessel, the\r\n_Friends_, a brig, commanded by Captain Jarvis. While in Tenby harbour\r\nshe was captured by a French privateer. He thus narrates the incident:—\r\n\r\n  At eight o’clock the captain set the watch, and it was my turn to\r\n  remain below; at twelve I went on deck, and continued till four, when\r\n  I went below again, but was scarcely dropped asleep when I was aroused\r\n  by hearing the captain exclaim, “Come on deck, my good fellow! here is\r\n  a privateer, and we shall all be taken.” When I got up, I found the\r\n  privateer close alongside of us. The captain hailed us in English, and\r\n  asked us from what port we came and where we were bound. Our captain\r\n  told the exact truth, and he then sent a boat with an officer in her,\r\n  to take all hands on board his own vessel, which he did, except myself\r\n  and a little boy, who had never been to sea before. He then sent his\r\n  prize-master and four men on board our brig, with orders to take her\r\n  into the nearest French port. When the privateer was gone, the\r\n  prize-master ordered me to go aloft and loose the main-top-gallant\r\n  sail. When I came down I perceived that he was steering very wildly,\r\n  through ignorance of the coast, and I offered to take the helm, to\r\n  which he consented, and directed me to steer south-east by south. He\r\n  then went below and was engaged in carousing with his companions. They\r\n  likewise sent me up a glass of grog occasionally, which animated my\r\n  spirits, and I began to conceive a hope not only of escaping, but also\r\n  of being revenged on the enemy. A fog, too, came on, which befriended\r\n  the design I had in view. I therefore altered the course to east by\r\n  north, expecting that we might fall in with some English vessel. As\r\n  the day advanced, the fog gradually dispersed, and the sky getting\r\n  clearer, we could perceive land. The prize-master and his companions\r\n  asked me what land it was; I told them it was Alderney, which they\r\n  believed, though at the same time we were just off Portland. We then\r\n  hauled our wind more to the south until we cleared the Bill of the\r\n  Island. Soon after we came in sight of land off St. Alban’s. The\r\n  prize-master then again asked what land it was which we saw; I told\r\n  him it was Cape la Hogue. My companions then became suspicious and\r\n  angry, thinking I had deceived them, and they took a dog that had\r\n  belonged to our captain and threw him overboard in a great rage, and\r\n  knocked down his house. This I supposed to be done as a caution, and\r\n  to intimate to me what would be my own fate if I had deceived them. We\r\n  were now within a league of Swanage, and I persuaded them to go ashore\r\n  to get a pilot. They then hoisted out a boat, into which I got with\r\n  three of them, not without serious apprehension as to what would be\r\n  the event; but hope animated, and my fortunate genius urged me on. We\r\n  now came so near shore that the people hailed us, and told us to keep\r\n  further west. My companions now began to swear, and said the people\r\n  spoke English; this I denied, and urged them to hail again; but as\r\n  they were rising to do so, I plunged overboard, and came up the other\r\n  side of the boat. They then struck me with their oars, and snapped a\r\n  pistol at me; but it missed fire. I still continued swimming, and\r\n  every time they attempted to strike me, I made a dive and disappeared.\r\n  The boat in which they were now took in water, and finding they were\r\n  in a vain pursuit and endangering their own lives and safety, with\r\n  little chance of being able to overtake me, they suddenly turned round\r\n  and rowed away as fast as possible to regain the vessel. Having got\r\n  rid of my foes, I put forth all my efforts to get to the shore, which\r\n  I at last accomplished, though with great difficulty. In the meantime\r\n  the men in the boat reached the brig, and spreading all their canvas,\r\n  bore away for the French coast. Being afraid that they would get off\r\n  with the vessel, I immediately sent two men, one to the signal-house\r\n  at St. Alban’s and another to Swanage, to obtain all the assistance\r\n  they could to bring her back.\r\n\r\nBy good fortune the _Nancy_, a cutter belonging to the Custom’s Service,\r\nhappened to be lying in Swanage Bay, under the command of Captain\r\nWillis, who, giving chase, re-captured the brig and brought her into\r\nCowes Roads. She was restored to her owners, on their paying salvage,\r\nbut Rattenbury received no reward for his services, and two days after\r\nre-joining the brig, was impressed into the Royal Navy and put on board\r\na cutter cruising off the Channel Islands. On her return to Spithead,\r\nRattenbury escaped on board a fishing smack and was landed at Portland,\r\nwhence he proceeded, on foot, to Beer, exchanging his cap with a young\r\nman whom he met on the way for a hat. Some days after a party from the\r\ncutter sent in search of him reached Lyme, but although they failed to\r\ncatch Rattenbury they had arrested the young man with whom he had\r\nexchanged hats. He was released, however, when they discovered that he\r\nwas not the man they were in search of.\r\n\r\nDuring the next six months he occupied himself with fishing and\r\nsmuggling, but his roving spirit once more took him to sea, and in\r\nMarch, 1800, we find him sailing for Newfoundland on board a brig\r\nbelonging to Topsham, commanded by Captain Elson. He was now twenty-two\r\nyears of age. On its way out the brig put into Waterford for provisions,\r\nbut had not been at sea many days before it had to put back to Waterford\r\nfor repairs, having sprung a leak. These were speedily effected owing to\r\nthe kindness of Lord Rolle, who lent seventeen of his soldiers to assist\r\nin the work. In due course they reached St. John’s, Newfoundland, and\r\nafter discharging a part of their cargo, proceeded to Placentia and\r\nafterwards to Pacee, where the ship was laid up for three months, while\r\nthe crew were employed in catching and curing cod. When they had secured\r\nsufficient for a cargo, they set sail, in November, for Oporto, but they\r\nhad not been at sea many days before they were chased and captured by a\r\nSpanish privateer, and a prize crew put on board. Rattenbury and an\r\nIrish lad were, however, allowed to remain on board, and the former, by\r\nmaking himself generally useful, gained the confidence of the Spanish\r\nprize-master, so that when the prize reached Vigo, Rattenbury, instead\r\nof being sent to a prison, was taken by the prize-master to his own\r\nhouse, and given such a good character that the owner of the privateer\r\ngave him his liberty and presented him with thirty dollars and a mule to\r\ntake him to Vianna, where the British Consul gave him a pass to Oporto.\r\nHere he met his late captain and ship-mates, who had also been given\r\ntheir liberty, and after some days found a vessel bound for Guernsey, on\r\nwhich he was engaged as mate. After an exceedingly rough passage he\r\nreached Guernsey on the 25th March, 1801, where he found a packet about\r\nto sail for Weymouth, in which he took a passage, and thus reached Beer\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th April, 1801, he married a young woman to whom he had become\r\nengaged before setting out for his last voyage and settled down at Lyme.\r\nFailing to find any regular employment, he determined to try\r\nprivateering again, and accordingly joined the _Alert_, a lugger\r\nbelonging to Weymouth, commanded by Captain Diamond. In her he sailed,\r\nin May, for Alderney, where, having taken in a stock of wine and\r\nspirits, a course was steered for the Western Islands in the expectation\r\nof falling in with Spanish vessels, but the venture was not successful,\r\nand the _Alert_ returned to Weymouth on the 28th December, 1801.\r\n\r\nRattenbury now remained at home for four years, and was employed in\r\npiloting and victualling ships. One day, while at Bridport, he was taken\r\nby the press-gang. He managed, however, to escape, and was pursued by\r\nthe lieutenant and nine men of the _Greyhound_. During the chase his\r\nwife appeared on the scene, and seized the lieutenant round the neck. A\r\nscuffle ensued, in which the townspeople joined, and Rattenbury was able\r\nto get clear away. After this adventure he went to live at Beer, and\r\nmade many trips in smuggling with varied success; but the lieutenant of\r\nthe _Greyhound_ was his most persistent enemy, and was determined to\r\ncapture him. On one occasion, at Weymouth, hearing that the lieutenant\r\nwas on his track, he took refuge in a public-house, the landlord of\r\nwhich was a friend of his. The lieutenant having received information as\r\nto his hiding-place proceeded to the spot, and at two o’clock in the\r\nmorning roused up the house, threatening to fire at the landlord through\r\nthe window and force an entrance if he did not immediately come down and\r\nopen the door. On the alarm being given, Rattenbury concealed himself in\r\nthe chimney, and remained there for about an hour, while the premises\r\nwere being searched. On the departure of the lieutenant he came out of\r\nthe chimney in a parlous condition, black with soot and much bruised,\r\nbut, as he says, “triumphing over the sense of pain itself, in the\r\nexultation which he experienced at having once more escaped out of the\r\nclutches of this keen-eyed Lieutenant and indefatigable picaroon.”\r\n\r\nBecoming sick of being constantly hunted, he determined to take to\r\nprivateering again, and shipped accordingly on board the _Unity_, a\r\ncutter then fitting out at Weymouth, commanded by Captain Head. About\r\nFebruary, 1805, they proceeded to sea, touching at Alderney to take in\r\nprovisions and spirits, and steered a course for Madeira, Teneriffe,\r\netc., in the hope of falling in with prizes; but they met with no\r\nsuccess, and returned to Beer in August of the same year. In consequence\r\nof his continued want of success in privateering, he determined never\r\nagain to engage in it, “a resolution,” he says, “which I have ever since\r\nkept, and of which I have never repented.”\r\n\r\nRattenbury now settled down ostensibly to a life of fishing, but\r\nactually of smuggling, in which he met with many adventures and every\r\nvariety of fortune. He had not been long at this employment when he was\r\ncaptured by the _Roebuck_ while off Christchurch, in Hampshire; but\r\nduring the chase one of the man-of-war’s men, named Slaughter, had his\r\narm blown off in the act of firing one of the guns. The captain was\r\nanxious to land the wounded man, and ordered a boat alongside to take\r\nhim ashore, into which Rattenbury smuggled himself, and on reaching\r\nshore got clear off. That same evening he borrowed a boat and rescued\r\nhis companions from the _Roebuck_, together with three kegs of gin, part\r\nof his contraband cargo which had been seized.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1806, he was captured by the _Duke of York_, cutter, in\r\na fog, and was taken to Dartmouth. On nearing that port, he jumped\r\noverboard, swam ashore, and concealed himself in some bushes. Two women,\r\nhowever, who had seen him, inadvertently revealed his place of\r\nconcealment, and he was re-taken. When he came on board again\r\n\r\n  ... He was in such a pickle that his own shipmates could not help\r\n  laughing at him, and the captain, completely aggravated, exclaimed, “I\r\n  will put you on board a man-of-war and send you to the East Indies,”\r\n  to which he replied by calling him an old rascal, an expression which\r\n  only tended to sharpen his anger still more.\r\n\r\nThe smugglers were all tried by the magistrates of Dartmouth, who\r\nsentenced them to a fine of £100, to go on board a man-of-war, or to\r\njail. They unanimously agreed to the last condition, but by six o’clock\r\nin the evening they were all so heartily sick of their quarters, which\r\nresembled the “Black Hole of Calcutta,” that they agreed to serve in the\r\nNavy, and were accordingly entered for the _Kite_, then lying in the\r\nDowns. They were removed the same evening to the _Safeguard_, brig,\r\nwhich lay in Dartmouth Roads. Next morning Rattenbury asked permission\r\nto go on board the _Duke of York_, on the pretext that he had a private\r\ncommunication to make to the captain. While on board, he seized an\r\nopportunity for escaping, jumped down on the bob-stay, and signalling\r\nwith his finger a small boat which was passing at the time dropped into\r\nher, and in five minutes was landed at Kingswear, opposite Dartmouth,\r\nwhence he made his way home by land.\r\n\r\nLater on he was captured by the _Humber_, sloop, commanded by Captain\r\nHill, and taken to Falmouth, where he was committed by the magistrates\r\nto jail. Next morning he and one of his shipmates were put into two\r\npost-chaises in charge of two constables to be taken to Bodmin. As the\r\nconstables stopped for liquid refreshment at every public-house on the\r\nroad they came to, they became somewhat merry towards evening. This was\r\nRattenbury’s opportunity. While the constables were taking their\r\npotations at the “Indian Queen,” a public-house a few miles from Bodmin,\r\nhe bribed the drivers not to interfere in what was to follow, and as\r\nsoon as the constables came out they were overpowered by the smugglers.\r\nRattenbury ran to a cottage close by, and the woman who occupied it\r\nshowed him a way through the back door and garden, and having run a\r\nmile, on looking back, he saw his companion, who had escaped in the same\r\nway. That night they reached Newquay together, and next morning found\r\ntheir way on hired horses to Mevagissey, whence they took a boat to\r\nBudleigh Salterton.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he defended himself in a cellar for four hours with\r\na reaping hook and a knife, against a sergeant and ten men, all armed,\r\nand only escaped capture through a diversion created by some women\r\narriving with a made-up story that a vessel had drifted ashore and that\r\na boy was in danger of drowning.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1808, through the influence of Lord Rolle, the\r\nsoldiers posted at Beer for the purpose of catching Rattenbury were\r\nordered away, and the ever-present fear of capture being thus removed,\r\nhe determined to settle down as a law-abiding citizen, and with this\r\nobject in view took a public-house, spending his leisure hours in\r\nfishing. But unfortunately this business did not prosper, so that about\r\nNovember, 1812, he reverted to his old trade of smuggling. In due course\r\nhe was captured by the _Catherine_, a brig commanded by Captain Tingle,\r\nand brought to Brixham. While there his wife was allowed to visit him,\r\nand with her he arranged a plan of escape. She, in company with the\r\nwives of his shipmates, were to come alongside the _Catherine_ on the\r\nnext day with a good boat. This was done, and Rattenbury, with his\r\ncompanions, jumped into the boat for the avowed purpose of helping “the\r\nladies” out of her up the side of the brig. As soon as the women were\r\nall out of the boat, Rattenbury gave the order to “shove off,” and\r\nalthough chase was immediately given and shots fired, the smugglers\r\nmanaged to land at a headland called “Bob’s Nose.” They quickly\r\nscrambled up the cliff, but Rattenbury, taking off his coat and hat and\r\nleaving them at the top of the cliff, rolled himself down again to the\r\nbeach and made for Torquay. On the next day he met his wife, and they\r\nset off together for Beer. His companions, however, were pursued, the\r\nchase being watched from the neighbouring hills by several hundred\r\npeople from Brixham, but only two were re-taken.\r\n\r\nRattenbury remained in his public-house till November, 1813, when he was\r\nobliged to close it owing to want of business and the bad debts he had\r\ncontracted. He was now in a bad way, without any obvious means of\r\nsubsistence, except fishing, which did not pay, and with a wife and four\r\nchildren to support. To add to his misfortunes, in the autumn of the\r\nsame year, he lost his boat in a gale. He, nevertheless, managed to pick\r\nup a little by piloting, and in the beginning of 1814 was fortunate\r\nenough to obtain employment with a Mr. Down, of Bridport, who kept a\r\nsmall boat for fishing. With the wages thus obtained he was enabled by\r\nAugust to buy another boat.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years he was engaged in running contraband cargoes\r\nfrom Cherbourg, and some of his expedients for outwitting the revenue\r\nofficers are very ingenious. On one occasion the officer who was\r\nsearching his ship for contraband goods came across a goose, which he\r\nwas desirous of purchasing, but as it was stuffed with fine lace instead\r\nof the orthodox sage and onions, Rattenbury naturally preferred not to\r\nsell it. At another time he had soldered up some valuable French silks\r\nin a tin box, so that when his boat was being overhauled he was able to\r\nthrow it overboard while the searchers were in another part of the boat,\r\nand the package being buoyant was subsequently recovered.\r\n\r\nOne dark night he landed a cargo at Seaton Hole, and began carrying the\r\nkegs one by one on his back up the cliff, when he tumbled over a donkey\r\nlying in the path. The beast set up such a vigorous braying that it\r\nawoke the preventive officer, who was asleep at the foot of the cliff,\r\nand the whole cargo was consequently seized.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1820, he contemplated building himself a house, and\r\nbought a piece of land for the site. He at once commenced collecting\r\nstones on the coast in his boat, and till the end of the year was\r\nsuperintending building operations.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, while returning from a smuggling expedition, he was captured\r\noff Dawlish by the crew of a coastguard boat and lodged in Exeter jail,\r\nwhere he remained till the 5th April, 1827, when he was released through\r\nthe influence of Sir William Pole. In May, and again in July, he was in\r\nLondon giving evidence in connection with a scheme for the construction\r\nof a harbour at Beer and a canal from Beer to Thorverton. He then\r\nremained at home engaged in his old occupations till 1829, when Lord\r\nRolle got him into the Royal Navy, but falling sick, he was discharged\r\non 6th January, 1830. His last smuggling adventure happened in January,\r\n1836. He was bringing twenty tubs of brandy in a cart from Torquay to\r\nNewton Bushel, and when within a mile of the latter place, at ten\r\no’clock at night, he was overtaken by some mounted officers, and the\r\nhorse, cart, and its contents were seized. Rattenbury, however, effected\r\nhis escape. This adventure ended his career as a smuggler. At the Exeter\r\nAssizes, held in March, 1836, he appeared as a witness on behalf of his\r\nson, who was charged with having been engaged with others in an affray\r\non Budleigh Salterton beach, in which some revenue officers were roughly\r\nhandled. The case excited considerable interest, and Rattenbury’s\r\ncross-examination by Mr. Sergeant Bompas afforded much amusement. The\r\nfollowing are some extracts from a contemporary account of the trial:—\r\n\r\n  Rattenbury _loquitur_. He keeps school at sea—fishes for sole, turbot,\r\n  brill; any kind of fish that comes to hook. B.: Which do you catch\r\n  oftenest, soles or tubs? R.: Oh, the devil a tub—(great\r\n  laughter)—there are too many picaroons going now-a-day. B.: You have\r\n  caught a good many in your time? R.: Ah, plenty of it! I wish you and\r\n  I had as much of it as we could drink—(laughter). B.: You kept school\r\n  at home and trained up your son? R.: I have always trained him up in a\r\n  regular honourable way, larnt him the Creed, the Lord’s Prayer, and\r\n  the Ten Commandments. B.: You don’t find there, Thou shalt not\r\n  smuggle? R.: No, but I find there, Thou shalt not bear false witness\r\n  against thy neighbour. B.: Nobody smuggles now-a-day? R.: Don’t they,\r\n  though! (Laughter.) B.: So these horses at Beer cannot go above three\r\n  or four miles an hour? R.: If you had not better horses you would\r\n  never get to London. I seldom ride on horse-back. If I do, I generally\r\n  falls off seven or eight times in a journey—(great laughter).\r\n\r\nRattenbury’s adventures now come to an end, and he appears to have\r\nsettled down to a quiet life for the remainder of his days, Lord Rolle\r\nhaving generously allowed him a pension of one shilling a week for\r\nlife.[27]\r\n\r\n                                                      MAXWELL ADAMS.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  This account of John Rattenbury is compiled from a somewhat scarce\r\n  little book entitled _Memoirs of a Smuggler_, compiled from his Diary\r\n  and Journal, containing the Principal Events in the Life of John\r\n  Rattenbury, of Beer, Devonshire, commonly called “The Rob Roy of the\r\n  West.” Sidmouth: J. Harvey, 1837. 12mo.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FAIR.\r\n\r\n                         BY THOMAS WAINWRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarnstaple Fair, although now deprived of some of its ancient commercial\r\nimportance by the establishment of great markets at other centres in\r\nNorth Devon, still attracts great numbers of purchasers of horses,\r\nExmoor ponies, cattle, and sheep, reared by the agriculturists of the\r\nneighbourhood. Buyers attend the fair not only from all parts of\r\nDevonshire, but also from places beyond the borders of the county, among\r\nothers cavalry officers come in some years to purchase horses for the\r\nmilitary service of the country, while visitors from a wide district\r\naround the town arrive in large numbers to enjoy the “fun of the fair.”\r\n\r\nThis annual event has a very ancient history, for the claim of the town\r\nto the right to hold the fair is granted in Charters and recognized in\r\nInquisitions from an early period, in one of which Inquisitions the\r\njurors say that among divers liberties and free customs used and enjoyed\r\nby the burgesses of the Borough by the Charter of the Lord Athelstan, of\r\nfamous memory, King of England, is the right to hold one fair in the\r\nyear. The date of the fair was anciently July 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and\r\n24th, as appears from the following regulations, which were in force for\r\na long period:—\r\n\r\n  1st. The fair shall continue for four days, viz., on the eve and the\r\n  day of the blessed Mary Magdalene and the two next days following.\r\n\r\n  2nd. The whole soil of Boutport Street and the other streets within\r\n  the said Borough belongs to the Mayor and Comonaltie of the said\r\n  Borough during the fair and until 12 o’clock at noon on the day\r\n  afterwards.\r\n\r\n  3rd. The said Mayor and Comonaltie may set and demise the said soil\r\n  one day before the eve of the said fair, and have the whole profits of\r\n  the said fair and the bailiff of the said Borough shall collect and\r\n  receive the same.\r\n\r\n  4th. Also they shall there have the cognizance of Pleas and a court of\r\n  Pie Poudre, as incident to all fairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\n               _From a Lithograph_]     [_by J. Powell._\r\n              QUEEN ANNE’S WALK AND THE QUAY, BARNSTAPLE.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe time for holding the fair was changed subsequently, probably during\r\nthe reign of King James I., the new regulations being as follows:—\r\n\r\n  If the 19th of September be on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, the\r\n  fair shall finish on the following Saturday night, but if on either of\r\n  the three subsequent days it shall be allowed to continue until Friday\r\n  in the next week.\r\n\r\nAnother change was made in the year 1852, the fair being then fixed to\r\ncommence on the Wednesday nearest to September 19th, and to continue for\r\nthe two days following only, and this is the present regulation\r\nrespecting its date and duration. By the latest arrangement the dealings\r\nin horses and ponies are limited to Thursday, the second day, the first\r\nbeing still devoted to the sale of cattle and sheep, and the third being\r\n_par excellence_ the pleasure day, although the shows, swings, “horses,”\r\nand other attractions, and the stalls, do a great trade on the other\r\ndays also.\r\n\r\nThe place for holding the fair has also been changed. A century ago the\r\ncattle were disposed of in Boutport Street, the horses in the North\r\nWalk, and the shows and stalls for pleasure-seekers were located in the\r\nSquare. For a few years, about 1880, the cattle and sheep were placed in\r\nVictoria Road, but by the present arrangement the cattle and sheep are\r\ndisposed of in the Cattle Market, the horses in the Strand, and the\r\npleasure-seekers find their shows and other attractions in the North\r\nWalk. It has already been mentioned that the cattle and sheep now sold,\r\nthough still many, are not so many as in the old days when Barnstaple\r\nfair was the only event of the kind in North Devon. In the year 1824, it\r\nwas recorded that 1,440 bullocks were driven in by the northern entrance\r\ninto the town, over Pilton Bridge, of which not 300 were driven out by\r\nthat road, and of these more than half were sold, and that it was\r\ncalculated that £20,000 was expended in the purchase of cattle.\r\n\r\nIn the Borough Records we have accounts of the sales of horses and\r\ncattle at an early period, which are interesting as showing the mode in\r\nwhich security was given by the purchasers and the prices paid. The\r\nfollowing are extracts from these records:—\r\n\r\n  Barnestaple.

The Regester of the Towne and Burrough of Barnestaple, by the\r\n  cause of the troubles and the contagion [plague] was not kept from the\r\n  year anno 1642 till the year anno 1647.\r\n\r\nThe following prices were realized for cattle sold at the various fairs\r\nmentioned above:—\r\n\r\n8 heifers, black like, price £30 10s. 0d.\r\n2 black oxen, topp cutt on farther eare. Price £13.\r\n2 heifers and 1 steward. Price £6 13s. 4d.\r\n1 red ox. Price £4 3s. 4d.\r\n2 oxen. Price £10.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the fair takes place with the ceremonies which have\r\nattended it for many generations. On the morning of the first day a\r\nlarge stuffed glove, fixed at the end of a pole, is displayed from a\r\nwindow of the Guildhall, having before the year 1852 been exhibited from\r\nthe west corner of the Quay Hall, which was demolished in that year to\r\nwiden the street and quay, and which had been, until the dissolution of\r\nreligious houses by Henry VIII., an ecclesiastical building, known as\r\nSt. Nicholas’ Chapel. In the Receiver’s accounts for 1615 occurs the\r\nentry:—\r\n\r\n               Paid for a glove put out at the fair, 4d.;\r\n\r\nand in those for 1622:—\r\n\r\n              Paid for a paire of gloves at the faire 4d.\r\n\r\nAnother entry in the same account being:—\r\n\r\n        Paid for candles to hange by a bull that was not beaten,\r\n\r\nfrom which it may be inferred that bull-baiting was one of the\r\namusements provided for visitors. The display of the glove is usually\r\nconsidered to be a symbol of the welcome extended to all comers. In the\r\nGuildhall meanwhile the sergeants-at-mace are busy preparing for all\r\ncomers who care to partake of it the toast and spiced ale, the latter\r\naccording to a recipe handed down for centuries. With this ale are\r\nfilled the handsome flagons belonging to the Corporation, and the loving\r\ncups charged from them are passed round to the assembled guests. A few\r\ntoasts are then given, among them that of “The Ladies,” the response to\r\nwhich often affords a good deal of amusement, for humorous Mayors have\r\nbeen known to astonish a bachelor in the company, sometimes “a young man\r\nfrom the country,” by calling upon him to respond; and while some\r\norators have passed the ordeal successfully, others have found the\r\nsituation an embarrassing one. The speeches ended, and the toast and ale\r\nconsumed, about noon a procession of the Mayor, Corporation, and\r\nofficials is formed, and, escorted by a large crowd of on-lookers, the\r\nTown Clerk reads the following proclamation at the High Cross and other\r\nplaces in the Borough:—\r\n\r\n                   =Proclamation for the Fair.=\r\n\r\n  THE MAYOR of this BOROUGH doth hereby give notice that there is a FREE\r\n  FAIR within this Borough for all manner of persons to BUY and SELL\r\n  within the same which fair begins on this day WEDNESDAY the\r\n  and shall continue until 12 o’clock on the night of FRIDAY next the\r\n          instant during which time the Mayor chargeth and commandeth on\r\n  HIS MAJESTY’S behalf all manner of persons repairing to this TOWN and\r\n  FAIR do keep the KING’S PEACE.\r\n\r\n  AND that all BUYERS and SELLERS to deal justly and truly and do use\r\n  true WEIGHTS AND MEASURES and that they duly pay their TOLL, STALLAGE\r\n  and other DUTIES upon pain that shall fall thereon\r\n\r\n  AND if any OFFENCES INJURY or WRONG shall be committed or done by or\r\n  to any person or persons within this TOWN FAIR and LIBERTY the same\r\n  shall be redressed according to JUSTICE and the LAWS of this REALM\r\n\r\n  DATED this            day of September 190\r\n\r\n                       =God Save the King.=\r\n\r\nIn the olden time it was the custom to have a stag hunt on the second\r\nday, and the “fair ball” is still, and has long been, kept up. It was\r\nformerly the practice for many tradesmen to keep open house during the\r\nfair, of which practice some of their customers took very liberal\r\nadvantage. Calling on one shopkeeper to pay a small account, they and\r\nmembers of their family who accompanied them would enjoy a hearty meal,\r\nand after an hour or two in the fair would repeat the proceeding with\r\nanother, and sometimes with a third. This has now been put a stop to by\r\nthe reduction of profits, through the competition brought about by the\r\nadvent of Co-operative Societies and Companies, and other causes. Not\r\nonly have the glories of Barnstaple fair been celebrated in prose, but\r\nthe poet has sung of them, and this sketch may be appropriately\r\nconcluded by giving one of the compositions that used to be sung:—\r\n\r\n                           =BARNSTAPLE FAIR.=\r\n\r\n Oh!

The general nature of the tie has long been known. It was a\r\npolitical nexus binding privileged burgesses to an influential family,\r\nand the sanction was interest. The motto might have been, on both sides,\r\n_do ut des_, for, while there were many professions of personal\r\nattachment, which may have been real, it was well understood that the\r\ncornerstone of the whole edifice was mutual advantage. As the\r\nconnection, venal in origin, crystallized into permanence and\r\nrespectability, it lost something of its sordid character. Sentiments of\r\nhonour and loyalty, and even chivalric devotion, were spoken and\r\ncultivated, but these were the accidents, the trimmings. The substance\r\nremained what it had always been—reciprocal profit. All this was vaguely\r\nfamiliar to the present generation of townspeople, to whom traditions of\r\nthe _ancien régime_ had descended from their forefathers, but the\r\narrival of twenty-six stout files, crowded with an infinite variety of\r\ncurious particulars, has made an evident change in the situation. We no\r\nlonger behold through the dark windows of distorted memory. Now at last\r\nwe see face to face; and for the authors of some of those “human\r\ndocuments” the Day of Doom would have already dawned, but for the screen\r\nof their own insignificance, which incriminating papers may remove, but\r\nthe discretion of the censor at once re-erects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\n             _From a Lithograph_]     [_by W. Spreat, Jun._\r\n                     ST. PETER’S CHURCH, TIVERTON.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nBefore we speak of Tiverton as an appanage of the Ryders, it will be\r\ndesirable to glance at the subject of pocket boroughs in general. There\r\nare no pocket boroughs or rotten boroughs now, and readers who have\r\nbestowed no special attention on political or constitutional\r\ndevelopments, may be glad of some measure of illumination as to their\r\nrise and their place in the representative system of England. An\r\nimpression formerly prevailed that the institution dated from the great\r\nRevolution, but this, it will be easy to show, was a fallacy. It was\r\nmuch older. On the other hand, the pocket-borough was never substituted\r\nby the arbitrary action of the Crown for the open borough, although it\r\nwas the settled belief of many of the inhabitants of Tiverton that under\r\nthe provisions of that mighty instrument, Magna Carta, the right of\r\nreturning members had been inalienably secured to them, and the\r\ncircumstance that this right was in fact exercised by neighbouring\r\ntowns, like Barnstaple and Taunton, was considered proof that the local\r\npotwallers, or potwallopers, were the victims of invidious and illegal\r\ndiscrimination. “Magna Carta,” said Sir Edward Coke, “is such a fellow\r\nthat he will not fear an equal”; and if it had been true that open\r\nvoting in the boroughs had been promulgated as the law of the land after\r\nRunnymede, it has been judicially determined that no departure from that\r\nprinciple, brought about by the use of the Royal prerogative or by any\r\nother means, would have been recognized as valid. The terms of Magna\r\nCarta, however, do not countenance the view that the burgesses of any\r\ngiven town became entitled at their own option to send deputies to\r\nParliament, or that universal suffrage was the rule. On the contrary,\r\nParliamentary representation had at that time no existence either in\r\ntheory or in practice. The Commons were simply tenants _in capite_ of\r\nthe Crown. After 1265, no doubt, elections began to be held, and many\r\nlittle places were summoned to return members, who received salaries\r\nfrom their constituencies in payment of their services. This charge\r\nrendered the honour a costly burden, and Edward I., one of the wisest of\r\nour princes, varied the direction of the writs so as to distribute the\r\nmaintenance of the new third estate over as wide an area as possible.\r\nThe towns themselves did not greatly value the franchise, and, in many\r\ninstances, petitioned to be relieved of the dubious privilege. It seems\r\nunquestionable that the mere receipt of an occasional summons did not\r\ncreate or confirm any inherent or indefeasible right of unbroken\r\nrepresentation, nor do we meet with any attempt to institute such a\r\nsystem until the days of the Reformation, when a new spirit invaded the\r\ncountry and the Commons, as a branch of the Legislature, made rapid\r\nstrides in numbers and importance.\r\n\r\nThen it was that the lawyers of the Inns of Court, many of them Puritan\r\nin sympathy, disinterred the ancient records, and, on the strength of\r\none or two summonses, insisted that such demesne towns, some mere\r\nvillages, were boroughs by prescription, and as such possessed the right\r\nto send representatives to Parliament for all time. The consequence was\r\nthat about thirty towns, in which great men at Court had an interest,\r\nresumed their lapsed privileges, and by the reign of Queen Elizabeth the\r\nLower House had received an accession of sixty fresh members. This seems\r\nto have been brought about in the first instance by the sheriffs sending\r\nprecepts to the places in question, and although in the thirteenth year\r\nof Elizabeth a debate took place regarding the admission of members from\r\ntowns not hitherto represented, the practice was not seriously\r\nchallenged owing to the efficient patronage and protection of the\r\ncourtiers before named. In subsequent reigns the Commons themselves\r\nproceeded to enlarge their body. James I., indeed, talked of reform, but\r\nthat pedantic monarch, far from checking the growth of the borough\r\nsystem, was the very sovereign to whom Tiverton was indebted for its\r\ncharter.\r\n\r\nThe small borough, in the nature of things, tended to become a\r\npocket-borough. In the reign of Elizabeth the Earl of Leicester “owned”\r\nthe town of Andover; and the degree to which this form of property was\r\nstretched is amusingly illustrated by the well-known story of Ann\r\nClifford, Countess of Pembroke, who lived in the days of the Merry\r\nMonarch. The Secretary of State, Sir Joseph Williamson, had sent her a\r\nletter in which he named a particular candidate for her borough of\r\nAppleby. Incensed at this presumption, the haughty dame returned the\r\nfollowing reply: “I have been bullied by an usurper, I have been\r\nneglected by a court, but I will not be dictated to by a subject. Your\r\nman shan’t stand.”\r\n\r\nThe system, it goes without saying, lent itself to numberless kinds of\r\nabuse. It has been stated that at one period a mistress of the King of\r\nFrance acquired some borough, and that the Nabob of Arcot was able to\r\nsecure the return of seven or eight members, all pledged to his\r\ninterest. These assertions may be true or they may not, but the\r\npossibility of such anomalies did not deter apologists from affirming\r\nthat the system was not by any means an unmixed evil.\r\n\r\n  A splendid senate, too, requires the gay ornamental parts, a sort of\r\n  shining plumage. The witty, the ingenious, the elegant, should be\r\n  represented. They were faithfully represented in our time by a\r\n  Sheridan, a Hare, a Fitzpatrick. Would a young adventurer, as Sheridan\r\n  was at his entrance in life, have attracted the eyes of the crowd?\r\n  Would the attic Hare or courtly Fitzpatrick have contended at a scene\r\n  like the Westminster election? We might have lost not only them, but\r\n  even the philosophic eloquence of Burke if all the returns were to\r\n  proceed from the crowd.—(George Moore, _History of the British\r\n  Revolution_, p. 341.)\r\n\r\nThis brief sketch will perhaps suffice as an explanation of the origin\r\nand character of the borough system in general. Let us now turn to the\r\ncase of Tiverton in particular. As has been intimated, many of the\r\ninhabitants believed that Tiverton was a borough by prescription, and\r\nthat accordingly the crown could not by its charter limit the right of\r\nelection to members of the corporate body alone. Naturally the evidence\r\nrelied on was that of State papers. An inquisition _post mortem_ a^o 51\r\nEdw. III. sets out the extent and value of the manor and borough, from\r\nwhich it appears that the two were distinct as to rents and services,\r\nand that each had a separate court. By Letters Patent a^o 1 Edw. IV.,\r\nthe King grants the manor, borough and hundred to Humphry Stafford,\r\nKnight, in special tail without any other description. These data are\r\nobviously insufficient, and search was made at the Rolls Chapel from the\r\nthirty-third year of Henry VIII., the year of the earliest return to\r\nParliament extant since the reign of Edward IV. The result was not\r\nsatisfactory to the enthusiasts who instituted the inquiry, the first\r\nreturn discovered being that of 18 James I., when John Bamfylde and John\r\nDavye, Esqrs., were returned by indenture dated the 20th December, by\r\nthe Mayor, capital burgesses, and assistants. It may be added that in\r\nPrynne’s _Brevia Parliamentaria_ there occurs no mention of Tiverton,\r\nwhich, on all these grounds, can hardly have been a borough in the sense\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nTiverton, then, we may take it as certain, did not enjoy the right of\r\nreturning members until the thirteenth year of the reign of James I.,\r\nwhen the Mayor, Capital Burgesses, Assistant Burgesses of the town and\r\nparish, or the major part of them, were empowered to choose and nominate\r\ntwo discreet and sufficient men to be burgesses of the Parliament. The\r\ncharter was renewed in the same terms in the fourth year of James II.,\r\nand again in the reign of George II., so that we need feel no surprise\r\nthat, when the potwallopers from time to time threatened to assert their\r\nsupposed right, the members of the Common Council, assured of their\r\nlegal position, treated such vapourings with calm superiority. Until the\r\ntidal wave of reform demolished the bulwarks of their monopoly, the\r\ntwenty-four were sole masters and arbiters. It was they who had the\r\nright to decide who should sit in Parliament for the ancient town—they\r\nand they alone. But how that right was exercised, if we except the bare\r\nlist of the Council’s nominees, there is for a long period no evidence\r\nto show.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was always material for a deal, and in the former half of\r\nthe eighteenth century Tiverton already figures as a political\r\ntied-house. The overlordship afterwards acquired by the Ryder family was\r\nthen vested in a politician of some note, who in 1728 was one of the\r\nrepresentatives of Tiverton, though the Parliamentary connection of his\r\nhouse with Honiton was even closer and of much longer standing, lasting,\r\nindeed, from 1640 to 1796. We allude to Sir William Yonge. Martin\r\nDunsford, the first real historian of Tiverton, describes him as “a\r\npopular man and closely attached to the minister, Sir Robert Walpole,”\r\nadding that he “had great influence over the leading members of the\r\nCorporation of Tiverton, and generally directed their choice of\r\nburgesses.” The same writer, referring to Sir Edward Montague and\r\nCharles Gore, Esquire, who in 1761 held one of the seats successively,\r\nmakes bold to assert that “there is reason to believe these members were\r\nnever in Tiverton, but bargained for their seats at a distance either\r\nwith Sir William Yonge or with Oliver Peard, Esq., the _primum mobile_,\r\nof the Corporation.” With regard to the former, there is clearly some\r\nmisapprehension, as he had died in 1755, but the tradition that this\r\neminent Devonshire worthy was dictator at Tiverton must have rested on a\r\nsolid foundation. It behoves us, therefore, to render some further\r\naccount of him.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his successful career Sir William, who was the fourth\r\nholder of the baronetcy, became one of the Lords of the Treasury, and on\r\nthe restoration of the order in 1725, was created a Knight of the Bath.\r\nSubsequently he was appointed Secretary at War and Privy Councillor, and\r\nover and above these political distinctions, was entitled to write after\r\nhis name the honourable symbols LL.D. and F.R.S. As Dunsford implies, he\r\nwas a great personal friend of Walpole, and his support was of\r\ninestimable value to that statesman, “the glory of the Whigs.” Outside\r\nthe house he does not appear to have counted (save, of course, in\r\nDevonshire), but inside, partly by reason of his high ability, and\r\npartly on account of his voice, which is stated to have been peculiarly\r\nmelodious, his speeches were eagerly listened to. One curious fact\r\npreserved concerning him is that Sir Robert could speak from notes taken\r\nby Yonge, and by no other.\r\n\r\nDuring the local supremacy of this statesman, and doubtless under his\r\nauspices and sponsorship, there was introduced to the Corporation of\r\nTiverton a member of the Bar, Dudley Ryder, Esq., who in 1735 became\r\ntheir representative. In 1741, the same gentleman, but now known as Sir\r\nDudley Ryder, Solicitor-General, was re-elected; and he continued to\r\nhold the seat until 1754, when he was elevated to the great office of\r\nLord Chief Justice of the Queen’s Bench. Mr. Nathaniel Thomas Ryder\r\nsucceeded him, but only for a short time, after which Mr. Nathaniel\r\nRyder occupied the seat, and remained one of the members till, in 1776,\r\nhe was called to the House of Lords by the title of Baron Harrowby. As\r\nthe Hon. Dudley Ryder was still an infant, Mr. John Wilmot was permitted\r\nto fill the vacancy, but on the clear understanding that he would at the\r\nproper time make way for Lord Harrowby’s son and heir. This condition\r\nwas eventually carried out in the most honourable manner, and, on the\r\npart of Lord Harrowby, with a patriotic regard for the public interests.\r\n\r\nThus, little by little and step by step, the Ryders firmly consolidated\r\ntheir political influence in the town, and though only one of the seats\r\nwas claimed for a member of the family, the other seat also was\r\nevidently at their disposal. This for a long series of years was\r\nentrusted to the Duntzes, rich merchants of Exeter, who became baronets.\r\nApart from politics, the Ryders had no connection with Devonshire, which\r\nthey seldom visited, but Sir John Duntze, living at Rockbeare, and a\r\nmember of the Tiverton Corporation, was able to keep a watchful eye on\r\nthe local barometer, of whose subtle changes he (and most of his\r\ncolleagues) kept Lord Harrowby sedulously and punctually informed\r\nthrough the post. On the other hand, poor Duntze, a perfect martyr to\r\nrheumatism, experienced, owing to the exposure of the long journey by\r\ncoach, considerable difficulty in attending to his Parliamentary duties,\r\nand for practical purposes Lord Harrowby, or his nominee, was the London\r\nagent of the Tiverton Corporation. From the point of view of convenience\r\nno arrangement could have been happier.\r\n\r\nThe above remarks apply to the first Lord Harrowby and the first Sir\r\nJohn Duntze. The second Lord Harrowby, after a distinguished official\r\ncareer, was advanced to the dignity of an earldom, and locally much\r\nregret was expressed that he did not take his second title from the town\r\nso long represented by his grandfather, his father, and himself. Had\r\nthis been the case, the present Lord Chancellor, whose eldest son enjoys\r\nthe courtesy title of Viscount Tiverton, must have looked elsewhere for\r\na subsidiary territorial designation. The second Sir John Duntze lived\r\nat Tiverton in a large house, which he either erected or restored for\r\nhimself in the centre of the town; and an old man named Court, who is\r\nstill alive, but almost totally blind, told me a year or two since of a\r\nlively incident which he can remember as taking place in front of the\r\nfloridly decorated mansion. The potwallopers of the place, he said,\r\norganized a torchlight procession, the principal feature of which was a\r\ncavalcade of four-and-twenty bedizened donkeys. The point could not be\r\nmissed. The asses were aggressively emblematic of the “corporators,” and\r\ntheir riders of the family of which Lord Harrowby was the head.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, the Parliamentary connection ended with the passage of the\r\nReform Bill. The alliance had always been with the Corporation rather\r\nthan with the town, although many of the inhabitants, directly and\r\nindirectly, had been repeatedly benefited by the generous consideration\r\nof Lord Harrowby and his relations. There was, however, in the town a\r\nstrong body of malcontents numerous enough to carry their point, and a\r\npotent counter-attraction had arisen in the person of Mr. John\r\nHeathcoat, a resident manufacturer, whom his opponents derisively styled\r\n“Lord Tiverton.” In view of these facts, Lord Harrowby’s friends felt it\r\ntheir duty to notify him that no member or adherent of his family would\r\nstand a chance of being returned at the approaching open election. The\r\nmembers of the Common Council, loyal to the end, refused the least\r\ncountenance or support to any of the new candidates until his lordship’s\r\nwishes had been disclosed, but the day of their predominance was already\r\npast. Politically, the game was up. Both Lord Harrowby and his brother,\r\nthe Hon. Richard Ryder, consented to remain members of the Corporation,\r\nbut three years later the “iron hand of Parliament,” as the Town Clerk\r\nexpressed it, “terminated the long continuance and interchange of\r\nfriendly communications.” At present the chief, if not the sole\r\nsurviving, link between the family of Ryder and Tiverton is the large\r\nshare of the ecclesiastical patronage of the borough still in the hands\r\nof Lord Harrowby.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the Ryder correspondence. The earliest letters appear to\r\ndate from the time when the Georgian lawyer was elevated to the bench\r\nand the seat which he had occupied, no doubt to his immense advantage,\r\npassed by inheritance to his son, then a young man fresh from college.\r\nWe have the very epistles written by the gentleman whom Dunsford so\r\ngrandly names “the _primum mobile_ of the Corporation,” congratulating\r\nhim on taking his master’s degree and absolving him from the unnecessary\r\ntrouble of a journey to the south in order to attend his cut-and-dried\r\nelection. A letter from Mr. Osmond acquaints him with the departure from\r\nthe town of a “pretty partner” whose lively manners had enhanced the\r\nenjoyment of a visit, whilst the member for Tiverton was yet a callow\r\nbachelor. Eight years later Mr. Ryder had joined the noble army of\r\nBenedicks, and then we find Mrs. Peard afflicted with an unselfish\r\nanxiety to gratify his lady with a fine collection of shells.\r\n\r\nSuch pleasing gifts were the regular accompaniment and sweetener of the\r\nmore serious transactions, the graver obligations which formed the\r\nmainstay of the connection. On the part of the members there was the\r\nannual present of a pair of bucks for the municipal banquet, and one of\r\nthe oddest passages in this vast epistolary jungle is to be found in a\r\nletter of Sir John Duntze, in which he informs his colleague that a\r\nmember of the Corporation, on bad terms with another member, announced\r\nas the ostensible cause of the quarrel, that he had been improperly\r\nhelped to venison on the occasion of this important festival. Allusions\r\nto the subject are so frequent and unctuous, that one is tempted to\r\nconclude that in those gay, convivial days the yearly consignment of\r\nvenison was a more considerable factor in the case than we should now\r\ndeem possible. Thus, Mr. Mayor observes, with the distinctive air of a\r\nman of the world:—\r\n\r\n  We had on Thursday the Grand Dinner, when ninety-four gentlemen dined\r\n  with me, amongst whom was Sir Rich. Bampfylde and Mr. Ackland, eldest\r\n  son of Sir Thos. Ackland, who is going to be married to Sir Rich^d’s\r\n  second daughter, a most amiable lady. This is a very great alliance\r\n  for Sir Richard Bampfylde’s family, and will be the means of keeping\r\n  everything quiet in the county.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the topic of the social status of the Corporation,\r\nwhich was comparatively high. Its critics, indeed, complained that it\r\nincluded attornies, “very improper persons to be elected”; and the\r\nmembers were frequently laughed at for “having Mayors in trade.” In\r\nreply to this heavy indictment it was alleged by one of their number\r\nthat at least twenty-two out of the twenty-four had landed property\r\neither in the town or in the parish. This was in 1831. In the reign of\r\nWilliam and Mary the “burgesses” are described some as esquires, others\r\nas merchants, and one or two as yeomen; and this standard, there is\r\nreason to think, was consistently maintained. Tiverton, it may be well\r\nto say, was for centuries an important centre of the woollen trade.\r\nInstead of one big factory, as now, for the production of lace, there\r\nwere many modest firms engaged in the manufacture and sale of serges,\r\netc., and consequently the Common Council was, above all things, the\r\nvalued preserve of families enriched by commerce, some of whom had\r\nacquired all the attributes of gentle birth and breeding. Mr. Worth, of\r\nWorth, and Mr. Cruwys, of Cruwys Morchard, belonged to two of the oldest\r\nfamilies of Devon, and an ancestor of the former had sat in Parliament\r\nfor Tiverton in days when the choice of members was apparently free and\r\nunfettered. With such the Ryders corresponded in the most genial,\r\nunaffected, and friendly way, and, in their somewhat infrequent visits\r\nto the place, were glad to accept their hospitality. They would, for\r\ninstance, occasionally stay with Mr. Dickinson, of Knightshayes, an\r\nancestor of the present Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Sir W. H.\r\nWalrond), and once, at least, Air. George Owen, of Lowman Green, was\r\nhonoured by a surprise visit from the younger nobleman.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1808, this second Lord Harrowby condescended to be Mayor—a\r\nconcession which resulted in a somewhat diverting misconception. It\r\nappears that a Barnstaple correspondent, interested in the working of\r\nthe mails, had written to him in the belief that he was a “common or\r\ngarden” mayor—a plain Mr. Mayor. His consternation on learning the truth\r\ndoes not need to be imagined, for he has pictured it himself:—\r\n\r\n  I was much mortified at my ignorance at the receipt of your Lordship’s\r\n  letter, for which I beg to apologize. Far from having the least idea\r\n  that the Corporation of Tiverton was so highly respected and had the\r\n  Honor of a Nobleman of your Lordship’s High Rank for Mayor, I\r\n  naturally concluded it to be an open borough like Barnstaple.\r\n\r\nLord Harrowby was coached for the inaugural ceremonies by the cousins\r\nWood, the elder of whom, Mr. Beavis Wood, who long filled the office of\r\nTown Clerk, was by far the shrewdest of the Ryders’ multitudinous\r\ncorrespondents. Even now his clever, incisive letters, lit up with many\r\na happy jest, are a pleasure to peruse, and neither in his earlier nor\r\nin his later ones was he inclined to spare the feelings and\r\neccentricities of those with whom his lot was cast. Thus, on August 5th,\r\n1808, he writes:—\r\n\r\n  The Mayor now again produced your Lordship’s Letter, desiring to know\r\n  the answer they might [deem?] it proper for him to give to it, when\r\n  they unanimously acknowledged your Lordship’s kind offer, and gladly\r\n  consented to embrace it, and elect you Mayor for the ensuing year. The\r\n  Business being unanimous, to be sure on that account from such an\r\n  offer it must be pleasant; but those assembled on this occasion did\r\n  not look like _old Christians_ in old Times at previous meetings on\r\n  such occasions. Twelve o’clock by Day is always a dull, dry time, when\r\n  old Tiverton aldermen never met to do chearful Business, as they could\r\n  not fix their Nominee by drinking his Health. Father Tucker gave the\r\n  Company a Hint of it, but it had no effect. I suppose as those of the\r\n  Junta are now under pantile Influence, and have turned their Backs on\r\n  our Lord Bishop, they will leave off drinking wine, unless when quite\r\n  by themselves.\r\n\r\n_Tempora mutantur._ Of the old times and the old Christians Mr. Wood had\r\ntold Lord Harrowby not a few entertaining stories, which are still\r\npreserved in his faded but excellent handwriting. Possibly at some\r\nfuture date they may be printed for the benefit of students of human\r\nnature, together with extracts from other correspondence, but with one\r\nmore specimen of his admirable humour this paper must be brought to a\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n                                                     Sept. 17, 1775.\r\n\r\n  This afternoon according to the usual Custom the Corporation attended\r\n  the new Mayor to Church, but before the Procession moved from the Town\r\n  House, there happened a very unseasonable altercation and Dispute\r\n  between Mr. Osmond, Mr. Mayor, and Mr. Lewis about the priority of\r\n  reading the newspapers which are sent here directed to you. For since\r\n  the late spite commenced, and almost during the whole of Mr. Lewis’s\r\n  Mayoralty, care has been taken to prevent the newspapers coming to Mr.\r\n  Osmond’s hands, and they have been sent about to persons out of the\r\n  Corporation. Words grew high and rough, and this mad Trio did not end\r\n  ’till each had called the other a damned Liar. Mr. Atherton[28] was\r\n  present, and being met to go to church, the Magistrates recollected\r\n  themselves, and after their return from prayers they looked at one\r\n  another as quietly as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  The Rev.
