A translation of the Code, done by\r\nMr. Johns of Queens' College, Cambridge, the highest living authority on\r\nthis department of study, has just been published by Messrs. T. & T.\r\nClark in a cheap and attractive booklet.  Winckler says it is the most\r\nimportant Babylonian record which has thus far been brought to\r\nlight.\"--_The Expository Times_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Code of Hammurabi is one of the most important monuments in the\r\nhistory of the human race.  Containing as it does the laws which were\r\nenacted by a king of Babylonia in the third millennium B.C., whose rule\r\nextended over the whole of Mesopotamia from the mouths of the rivers\r\nTigris and Euphrates to the Mediterranean coast, we must regard it with\r\ninterest.  But when we reflect that the ancient Hebrew tradition ascribed\r\nthe migration of Abraham from Ur of the Chaldees to this very period, and\r\nclearly means to represent their tribe father as triumphing over this\r\nvery same Hammurabi (Amraphel, Gen. xiv. 1), we can hardly doubt that\r\nthese very laws were part of that tradition.  At any rate, they must have\r\nserved to mould and fix the ideas of right throughout that great empire,\r\nand so form the state of society in Canaan when, five hundred years\r\nlater, the Hebrews began to dominate that region.\r\n\r\nSuch was the effect produced on the minds of succeeding generations by\r\nthis superb codification of the judicial decisions of past ages, which\r\nhad come to be regarded as 'the right,' that two thousand years and more\r\nlater it was made a text-book for study in the schools of Babylonia,\r\nbeing divided for that purpose into some twelve chapters, and entitled,\r\nafter the Semitic custom, _Ninu ilu sirum_, from its opening words.  In\r\nAssyria also, in the seventh century B.C., it was studied in a different\r\nedition, apparently under the name of 'The Judgments of Righteousness\r\nwhich Hammurabi, the great king, set up.'  These facts point to it as\r\ncertain to affect Jewish views before and after the Exile, in a way that\r\nwe may expect to find as fundamental as the Babylonian influence in\r\ncosmology or religion.\r\n\r\nFor many years fragments have been known, have been studied, and from\r\ninternal evidence ascribed to the period of the first dynasty of Babylon,\r\neven called by the name Code Hammurabi.  It is just cause for pride that\r\nAssyriology, so young a science as only this year to have celebrated the\r\ncentenary of its birth, is able to emulate astronomy and predict the\r\ndiscovery of such bright stars as this.  But while we certainly should\r\nhave directed our telescopes to Babylonia for the rising of this light\r\nfrom the East, it was really in Elam, at Susa, the old Persepolis, that\r\nthe find was made.  The Elamites were the great rivals of Babylonia for\r\ncenturies, and it seems likely that some Elamite conqueror carried off\r\nthe stone from a temple at Sippara, in Babylonia.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, we owe it to the French Government, who have been\r\ncarrying on explorations at Susa for years under the superintendence of\r\nM. J. de Morgan, that a monument, only disinterred in January, has been\r\ncopied, transcribed, translated, and published, in a superb quarto\r\nvolume, by October.  The ancient text is reproduced by photogravure in a\r\nway that enables a student to verify word by word what the able editor,\r\nFather V. Scheil, _Professeur a l'Ecole des Hautes-Etudes_, has given as\r\nhis reading of the archaic signs.  The volume, which appears as _Tome\r\nIV., Textes Elamites-Semitiques_, of the _Memoires de la Delegation en\r\nPerse_ (Paris, Leroux, 1902), is naturally rather expensive for the\r\nordinary reader.  Besides, the rendering of the eminent French savant,\r\nwhile distinguished by that clear, neat phrasing which is so charming a\r\nfeature of all his work, is often rather a paraphrase than a translation.\r\nThe ordinary reader who desires to estimate for himself the importance of\r\nthe new monument will be forced to wonder how and why the same word in\r\nthe original gets such different renderings.  Prolonged study will be\r\nneeded to bring out fully the whole meaning of many passages, and it may\r\nconduce to such a result to present the public with an alternative\r\nrendering in an English dress.  Needless to say, scholars will continue\r\nto use Scheil's edition as the ultimate source, but for comparative\r\npurposes a literal translation may be welcome as an introduction.\r\n\r\nThe monument itself consists of a block of black diorite, nearly eight\r\nfeet high, found in pieces, but readily rejoined.  It contains on the\r\nobverse a very interesting representation of the King Hammurabi,\r\nreceiving his laws from the seated sun-god Samas, 'the judge of heaven\r\nand earth.'  Then follow, on the obverse, sixteen columns of writing with\r\n1114 lines.  There were five more columns on this side, but they have\r\nbeen erased and the stone repolished, doubtless by the Elamite conqueror,\r\nwho meant to inscribe his name and titles there.  As we have lost those\r\nfive columns we may regret that he did not actually do this, but there is\r\nnow no trace of any hint as to who carried off the stone.  On the reverse\r\nside are twenty-eight columns with more than 2500 lines of inscription.\r\n\r\nA great space, some 700 lines, is devoted by the king to setting out his\r\ntitles, his glory, his care for his subjects, his veneration of his gods,\r\nand incidentally revealing the cities and districts under his rule, with\r\nmany interesting hints as to local cults.  He also invokes blessing on\r\nthose who should preserve and respect his monument, and curses those who\r\nshould injure or remove it.  A translation of this portion is not given,\r\nas it is unintelligible without copious comment and is quite foreign to\r\nthe purpose of this book, which aims solely at making the Code\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\nI desire to express my obligations to Dr. F. Carr for his many kind\r\nsuggestions as to the meaning of the Code.\r\n\r\nThe Index will, it is hoped, serve more or less as a digest of the Code.\r\nOne great difficulty of any translation of a law document must always be\r\nthat the technical expressions of one language cannot be rendered in\r\nterms that are co-extensive.  The rendering will have implications\r\nforeign to the original.  An attempt to minimise misconceptions is made\r\nby suggesting alternative renderings in the Index.  Further, by labelling\r\na certain section, as the law of incest, for example, one definitely\r\nfixes the sense in which the translation is to be read.  Hence it is\r\nhoped that the Index will be no less helpful than the translation in\r\ngiving readers an idea of what the Code really meant.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this remarkable monument will be made the subject of many\r\nvaluable monographs in the future, which will greatly elucidate passages\r\nnow obscure.  But it was thought that the interest of the subject\r\nwarranted an immediate issue of an English translation, which would place\r\nthe chief features of the Code before a wider public than those who could\r\nread the original.  The present translation is necessarily tentative in\r\nmany places, but it is hoped marks an advance over those already\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nDr. H. Winckler's rendering of the Code came into my hands after this\r\nwork was sent to the publishers, and I have not thought it necessary to\r\nwithdraw any of my renderings.  In some points he has improved upon\r\nProfessor Scheil's work, in other points he is scarcely so good.  But any\r\ndiscussion is not in place here.  I gratefully acknowledge my obligations\r\nto both, but have used an independent judgment all through.  I hope\r\nshortly to set out my reasons for the differences between us in a larger\r\nwork.  A few of Dr. Winckler's renderings are quoted in the Index, and\r\nmarked--Winckler's tr.\r\n\r\nC. H. W. JOHNS.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE,\r\n_January_ 31, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEXT OF THE CODE\r\n\r\n\r\nsection 1.

If a man has bartered for the field, garden, or house of a\r\nganger, constable, or tributary, and has given exchanges, the ganger,\r\nconstable, or tributary shall return to his field, garden, or house, and\r\nshall keep the exchanges given him.\r\n\r\nsection 42.  If a man has taken a field to cultivate and has not caused\r\nthe corn to grow in the field, and has not done the entrusted work on the\r\nfield, one shall put him to account and he shall give corn like its\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\nsection 43.  If he has not cultivated the field and has left it to\r\nitself, he shall give corn like its neighbour to the owner of the field,\r\nand the field he left he shall break up with hoes and shall harrow it and\r\nreturn to the owner of the field.\r\n\r\nsection 44.  If a man has taken on hire an unreclaimed field for three\r\nyears to open out, and has left it aside, has not opened the field, in\r\nthe fourth year he shall break it up with hoes, he shall hoe it, and\r\nharrow it, and return to the owner of the field, and he shall measure out\r\nten _GUR_ of corn _per GAN_.\r\n\r\nsection 45.  If a man has given his field for produce to a cultivator,\r\nand has received the produce of his field, and afterwards a thunderstorm\r\nhas ravaged the field or carried away the produce, the loss is the\r\ncultivator's.\r\n\r\nsection 46.  If he has not received the produce of his field, and has\r\ngiven the field either for one-half or for one-third, the corn that is in\r\nthe field the cultivator and the owner of the field shall share according\r\nto the tenour of their contract.\r\n\r\nsection 47.  If the cultivator, because in the former year he did not set\r\nup his dwelling, has assigned the field to cultivation, the owner of the\r\nfield shall not condemn the cultivator; his field has been cultivated,\r\nand at harvest time he shall take corn according to his bonds.\r\n\r\nsection 48.  If a man has a debt upon him and a thunderstorm ravaged his\r\nfield or carried away the produce, or the corn has not grown through lack\r\nof water, in that year he shall not return corn to the creditor, he shall\r\nalter his tablet and he shall not give interest for that year.\r\n\r\nsection 49.  If a man has taken money from a merchant and has given to\r\nthe merchant a field planted with corn or sesame, and said to him,\r\n'Cultivate the field, reap and take for thyself the corn and sesame which\r\nthere is,' if the cultivator causes to grow corn or sesame in the field,\r\nat the time of harvest the owner of the field forsooth shall take the\r\ncorn or sesame which is in the field and shall give corn for the money\r\nwhich he took from the merchant, and for its interests and for the\r\ndwelling of the cultivator, to the merchant.\r\n\r\nsection 50.  If the field was cultivated or the field of sesame was\r\ncultivated when he gave it, the owner of the field shall take the corn or\r\nsesame which is in the field and shall return the money and its interests\r\nto the merchant.\r\n\r\nsection 51.  If he has not money to return, the sesame, according to its\r\nmarket price for the money and its interest which he took from the\r\nmerchant, according to the standard fixed by the king, he shall give to\r\nthe merchant.\r\n\r\nsection 52.  If the cultivator has not caused corn or sesame to grow in\r\nthe field, he shall not alter his bonds.\r\n\r\nsection 53.  If a man has neglected to strengthen his bank of the canal,\r\nhas not strengthened his bank, a breach has opened out itself in his\r\nbank, and the waters have carried away the meadow, the man in whose bank\r\nthe breach has been opened shall render back the corn which he has caused\r\nto be lost.\r\n\r\nsection 54.  If he is not able to render back the corn, one shall give\r\nhim and his goods for money, and the people of the meadow whose corn the\r\nwater has carried away shall share it.\r\n\r\nsection 55.  If a man has opened his runnel to water and has neglected\r\nit, and the field of his neighbour the waters have carried away, he shall\r\npay corn like his neighbour.\r\n\r\nsection 56.  If a man has opened the waters, and the plants of the field\r\nof his neighbour the waters have carried away, he shall pay ten _GUR_ of\r\ncorn _per GAN_.\r\n\r\nsection 57.  If a shepherd has caused the sheep to feed on the green\r\ncorn, has not come to an agreement with the owner of the field, without\r\nthe consent of the owner of the field has made the sheep feed off the\r\nfield, the owner shall reap his fields, the shepherd who without consent\r\nof the owner of the field has fed off the field with sheep shall give\r\nover and above twenty _GUR_ of corn _per GAN_ to the owner of the field.\r\n\r\nsection 58.  If from the time that the sheep have gone up from the\r\nmeadow, and the whole flock has passed through the gate, the shepherd has\r\nlaid his sheep on the field and has caused the sheep to feed off the\r\nfield, the shepherd who has made them feed off the field one shall watch,\r\nand at harvest time he shall measure out sixty _GUR_ of corn _per GAN_ to\r\nthe owner of the field.\r\n\r\nsection 59.  If a man without the consent of the owner of the orchard has\r\ncut down a tree in a man's orchard, he shall pay half a mina of silver.\r\n\r\nsection 60.  If a man has given a field to a gardener to plant a garden\r\nand the gardener has planted the garden, four years he shall rear the\r\ngarden, in the fifth year the owner of the garden and the gardener shall\r\nshare equally, the owner of the garden shall cut off his share and take\r\nit.\r\n\r\nsection 61.  If the gardener has not included all the field in the\r\nplanting, has left a waste place, he shall set the waste place in the\r\nshare which he takes.\r\n\r\nsection 62.  If the field which has been given him to plant he has not\r\nplanted as a garden, if it was corn land, the gardener shall measure out\r\ncorn to the owner of the field, like its neighbour, as produce of the\r\nfield for the years that are neglected, and he shall do the ordered work\r\non the field and return to the owner of the field.\r\n\r\nsection 63.  If the field was unreclaimed land, he shall do the ordered\r\nwork on the field and return it to the owner of the field and measure out\r\nten _GUR_ of corn _per GAN_ for each year.\r\n\r\nsection 64.  If a man has given his garden to a gardener to farm, the\r\ngardener as long as he holds the garden shall give to the owner of the\r\ngarden two-thirds from the produce of the garden, and he himself shall\r\ntake one-third.\r\n\r\nsection 65.  If the gardener does not farm the garden and has diminished\r\nthe yield, he shall measure out the yield of the garden like its\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Here five columns of the monument have been erased, only the\r\ncommencing characters of column xvii. being visible.  The subjects of\r\nthis last part included the further enactments concerning the rights and\r\nduties of gardeners, the whole of the regulations concerning houses let\r\nto tenants, and the relationships of the merchant to his agents, which\r\ncontinue on the obverse of the monument.
