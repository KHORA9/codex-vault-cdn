Evolution Between 1814 And 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n     After Taine's death in March 1893, his nephew André\r\n     Chevrillon arranged his last manuscripts on the Church\r\n     and Education for publication and wrote the following\r\n     introduction which also tells us much about Taine and\r\n     his works\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE By André Chevrillon.\r\n\r\n\"To treat of the Church, the School, and the Family, describe the modern\r\nmilieu and note the facilities and obstacles which a society like our\r\nown encounters in this milieu, such was the program of the last[5101]\r\nsection of the \"Origins of Contemporary France.\" The preceding volume is\r\na continuation of the first part of this program; after the commune and\r\nthe department, after local societies, the author was to study moral\r\nand intellectual bodies in France as organized by Napoleon. This study\r\ncompleted, this last step taken, he was about to reach the summit. He\r\nwas about to view France as a whole, to comprehend it no longer\r\nthrough a detail of its organs, in a state of formation, but its actual\r\nexistence; no longer isolated, but plunged, along with other occidental\r\nnations, into the modern milieu, experiencing with them the effects of\r\none general cause which changed the physical and intellectual condition\r\nof men; which dissolved sentiments formerly grouping them together, more\r\nor less capable at length of adapting themselves to new circumstances\r\nand of organizing according to a new type suited to the coming age that\r\nnow opens before us.\r\n\r\nOnly a part of this last volume was written, that which relates to the\r\nChurch and to public instruction. Death intervened and suddenly arrested\r\nthe pen. M. Taine, at this moment, was about completing his analysis of\r\nsubordinate societies in France.--For those who have followed him thus\r\nfar it is already clear that the great defect of the French community\r\nis the fragmentation of the individuals, who isolated, dwindling, and\r\nprostrate at the feet of the all-powerful State, who, due to remote\r\nhistorical causes, and yet more so by modern legislation, have been made\r\nincapable of \"spontaneously grouping around a common interest.\"\r\nVery probably--and of this we may judge by two sketches of a plan,\r\nundoubtedly provisional, but the ideas of which were long settled in his\r\nmind--M. Taine would have first described this legislation and defined\r\nits principles and general characteristics. He meant to show it more\r\nand more systematic, deliberately hostile to collective enterprise,\r\nconsidering secondary bodies not as \"distinct, special organs,\"\r\nendowed with a life of their own, \"maintained and stimulated by private\r\ninitiation,\" but as agents of the State \"which fashions them after\r\na common pattern, imposes on them their form and prescribes their\r\nwork.\"--This done, this defect pointed out, the author was to enumerate\r\nthe consequences flowing from it, the social body entirely changed, \"not\r\nonly in its proportions but in its innermost texture,\" every tendency\r\nweakened by which individuals form groups that are to last longer than\r\nthemselves, each man reduced to his own self, the egoistic instinct\r\nenhanced while the social instinct wastes away for want of nourishment,\r\nhis daily imagination solely concerned with life-long aims,\r\nincapacitated for politics as he is \"lacking spheres of action in which\r\nhe may train himself according to his experiences and faculties\", his\r\nmind weakening in idleness and boredom or in a thirst for pleasure and\r\npersonal success,--in short, an organic impoverishment of all faculties\r\nof cohesion, leading to the destruction of the natural centers of\r\ngrouping and, consequently, to political instability.[5102]\r\n\r\nOne association of special import remains, the most spontaneous, the\r\ndeepest rooted, so old that all others derive from it, so essential\r\nthat in any attack upon it we see even the substance of the social body\r\ndecaying and diminishing. On the nature of the Family; on its profound\r\nphysiological origins; on its necessary role in the prolongation and\r\n\"perpetuation of the individual\" by affording him \"the sole remedy for\r\ndeath\"; on its primitive constitution among men of our own race; on its\r\nhistoric organization and development \"around the family home\"; on the\r\nnecessity of its subsistence and continuance in order to insure the\r\nduration of this home; on its other needs, M. Taine, with his knowledge\r\nof man and of his history, had given a good deal of thought to\r\nfundamental ideas analogous to those which he has consecrated to the\r\nclassic spirit, to the origin of honor and conscience, to the essence\r\nof local society, so many stones, as it were, shaped by him from time\r\nto time and deeply implanted as the foundations of his criticism of\r\ninstitutions. Having set forth the proper character and permanent wants\r\nof the Family he was able to study the legislation affecting it, and,\r\nfirst, \"the Jacobin laws on marriage, divorce, paternal authority and on\r\nthe compulsory public education of children; next, the Napoleonic laws,\r\nthose which still govern us, the Civil Code\" with that portion of it\r\nin which the equality and leveling spirit is preserved, along with \"its\r\ntendency to regard property as a means of enjoyment\" instead of the\r\nstarting-point and support of \"an enduring institution.\"--Having exposed\r\nthe system, M. Taine meant to consider its effects, those of surrounding\r\ninstitutions, and to describe the French family as it now exists. He had\r\nfirst studied the \"tendency to marriage\"; he had considered the motives\r\nwhich, in general, weaken or fortify it, and appreciated those now\r\nabsent and now active in France. According to him, \"the healthy ideal of\r\nevery young man is to found a family, a house of infinite duration, to\r\ncreate and to rule.\" Why in modern France does he give his thoughts to\r\n\"pleasure and of excelling in his career\"? Why does he regard marriage\r\n\"without enthusiasm, as a last measure, as a 'settling-down,' and not as\r\na beginning, the commencement of a veritable career, subordinating\r\nall others to it and regarding these, pecuniary and professional, as\r\nauxiliary and as means?\"--After the tendency to marriage, \"the tendency\r\nto paternity.\" How does the shrunken family come to live only for\r\nitself? In what way, in default of other interests,--homestead, domain,\r\nworkshop, lasting local undertakings,--how does the heart, now deprived\r\nof its food by the lack of invisible posterity, fall back on affection\r\nfor visible progeny?[5103] In a country where there are few\r\nopenings, where careers are overcrowded, what are the effects of this\r\npaid idolatry[5104], and, to sum up in one phrase, in what way does the\r\nFrench system of to-day tend to develop the most fatal of results, the\r\ndecline in the birth rate?\r\n\r\nHere the study of institutions on a grand scale terminated. Formerly,\r\nM. Taine had contemplated a completion of his labors by a description\r\nof contemporary France, the product of origins scrutinized by him and\r\nof which he had traced the formation. Having disengaged his factors he\r\nmeant to combine them, to show them united and acting in concert, all\r\ncentering on the great actual facts which dominate the rest and which\r\ndetermine the order and structure of modern society. As he had given a\r\npicture of old France he aimed to portray France as it now is, with\r\nits various groups,--village, small town and large city,--with its\r\ncategories of men, peasants, workmen, bourgeois, functionaries and\r\ncapitalists; with the forces that impel each class along, their\r\npassions, their ideas, their desires. Besides the numerical statistics\r\nof person he meant to have set forth the moral statistics of souls.\r\nAccording to him, psychological conditions exist which render the social\r\nactivity of men possible or impossible. And, especially, \"in a given\r\nsociety, there is always a psychological state which provokes the state\r\nof that society.\" It was his aim to seek out in the novel, in poetry, in\r\nthe arts since 1820, that is to say in all works that throw light on the\r\nvarious and successive kinds of the reigning ideal--in philosophy, in\r\nreligion, in industry, in all branches of French action and thought--the\r\nsigns of the psychological tendencies of modern Frenchman in this or\r\nthat social condition. What would this book have been? M. Taine had\r\nsketched it out so far back, he had abandoned it for so long a time and\r\nnever alluded to it, that nothing remains by which we can form any\r\nidea of it. But, in this undertaking demanding so much science, so much\r\nintuition, so much experience of accurate observation, of general views\r\nand precise generalization--in this vast study requiring such profound\r\nknowledge, not alone of France but of societies offering points of\r\ncomparison with her, we may be certain that the author of Notes\r\nsur Paris, Notes sur l'Angleterre, of the Ancien Régime, the critic\r\naccustomed to interpret civilizations, literature and works of art,\r\nthe thinker, in fine, who, to prepare himself for the greatest tasks he\r\nundertook, traveled five times over France, studying its life with\r\nthe eyes of an artist, in the light of history and of psychology, ever\r\npreceding his philosophic study with visual investigation, would have\r\nbeen equal to the task.[5105]\r\n\r\nAlready for several years, M. Taine, aware that his time was short, had\r\nnarrowed the limits of the work he was engaged upon. But what his work\r\nlost in breadth and in richness of detail it would have gained in\r\ndepth and in power. All his master ideas would have been found in it,\r\nforeshortened and concentrated. Always seeking in this or that group of\r\nthem what he called his generators, intellectual and moral as well as\r\npolitical, he would have described all those which explain the French\r\ngroup. Unfortunately, here again the elements are wanting which allow\r\none to foreshadow what this final analysis and last construction might\r\nhave been. M. Taine did not write in anticipation. Long before taking\r\nthe pen in hand he had derived his most significant facts and formed\r\nhis plan. He carried them in his brain where they fell into order of\r\nthemselves. Ten lines of notes, a few memoranda of conversations--faint\r\nreflections, to us around him, of the great inward light--are all that\r\nenable one to attempt an indication of the few leading conceptions were\r\nto complete \"Les Origines de la France Contemporaine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Le Milieu Moderne\", was to have been the title of the last book. The\r\nquestion here is how to discover the great characteristics of the period\r\ninto which European societies entered and about were to live. Rising\r\nto a higher point of view than that to which he had confined himself\r\nin studying France, M. Taine regarded its metamorphosis as a case of\r\ntransformation as general as the passage of the Cité antique over to\r\nthe Roman Empire over to the feudal State. Now, as formerly, this\r\ntransformation is the effect of a \"change in the intellectual and\r\nphysical condition of men\"; that is to say, in other words, in the\r\nenvironment that surrounds them. Such is the advent of a new geological\r\nperiod, of a glacial period, for example, or, more precisely, \"the very\r\nslow and then accelerated upheaval of a continent, forcing the submarine\r\nspecies which breathe by gills to transform themselves into species\r\nwhich breathe by lungs.\" It is impossible to divine in what sense this\r\nadaptation takes place if we do not comprehend the event, that is to\r\nsay if we do not perceive its starting-point and the innate force which\r\nproduces it. According to Taine, this force, in the present case, is the\r\nprogress the increasing authority of positive, verifiable science. What\r\na definition he would have given of science and its essence! What a\r\ntableau of its progress, the man whose thought was matured at the moment\r\nwhen the scientific spirit entered into history and literature; who\r\nbreathed it in his youth with the fervid and sacred enthusiasm of a poet\r\nseeing the world grow brighter and intelligible to him, and who, at the\r\nage of twenty-five, demanded of it a method and introduced this into\r\ncriticism and psychology in order to give these new life--the mechanical\r\nequivalent of heat, natural selection, spectroscopic analysis,\r\nthe theory of the microbes, recent discoveries in physics and the\r\nconstitution of matter, research into historic origins, psychological\r\nexplanation of texts, extension of oriental researches, discoveries of\r\nprehistoric conditions, comparative study of barbaric communities--every\r\ngrand idea of the century to which he has himself contributed, all those\r\nby which science embraces a larger and larger portion of the universe,\r\nhe saw them containing the same essence; all combining to change the\r\nconception of the world and substitute another, coherent and logical in\r\nthe best minds, but then confused and disfigured as it slowly descends\r\nto the level of the crowd.--He would have described this decent, the\r\ngradual diffusion, the growing power of the new Idea, the active ferment\r\nwhich it contains after the manner of a dogma, beneficent or pernicious\r\naccording to the minds in which it lodges, capable of arming men and\r\nof driving them on to pure destruction when not fully comprehended, and\r\ncapable of reorganizing them if they can grasp its veritable meaning.\r\n\r\nIts first effects are simply destructive, for, through Darwinism,\r\nthrough experimental psychology, through the physiology of the brain,\r\nthrough biblical exegesis, through the comparative study of savage\r\ncommunities and their moral systems, the new concepts at first shocks\r\nthe religious idea which it tends to replace; even, with the half-\r\ncultivated and in the minds of novices, it tends to pure negation, to\r\nhostility against existing religions. To every social gathering around\r\nthe religious idea that explains and sustains it, what a disturbance in\r\nthe secular system formed by the co-ordination and mutual adaptation of\r\nlaws, customs, morality, and institutions! What a rupture of the inward\r\nequilibrium which maintains man passive and tranquil! The consequent\r\nmental agitation will lead to agitation, impulsion, ambitions,\r\nlassitude, despondency, and disorder in all the sentiments which had\r\nthus far maintained every species of society, the family, the commune,\r\nthe Church, free association and the State!--Now, along with the\r\nimmediate effects of science on the intellectual habits of men consider\r\nthe effects of its application to their material condition; at first,\r\ntheir increased well-being, their power increased, then the rupture of\r\nthe ties that bind them to their birthplace, the concentration of masses\r\nof workmen in the towns to which they are attracted by great and rapid\r\nindustrial development, the influx of new ideas, of every species of\r\ninformation, the gradual decline of the old hereditary prejudices of\r\ncaste and parish which act automatically as instincts, and are useful\r\nas instincts to the small groups in which the individual is born and\r\nin which he lives. How could such a profound change in the condition of\r\nhumanity fail to undermine everywhere the order of things which group\r\nmen together? Why should not the new milieu at once attack all ancient\r\nforms of society? For, at the moment of its establishment, there exists\r\nin Europe a general form of society manifest through features in common;\r\na monarchy--hereditary royalty, dynastic but frequently limited, at\r\nleast in fact,--a privileged nobility performing military service as a\r\nspecial function, a clergy organized as a Church, proprietary and\r\nmore or less privileged, local or special bodies also proprietary--\r\nprovinces, communes, universities, brotherhoods, corporations--laws and\r\ncustoms which base the family on paternal authority, perpetuating it on\r\nthe natal soil and by social rank; in brief, institutions which modern\r\nideas disturb in every direction, the first effect of which is,\r\nwhile developing the spirit of doubt and investigation, to break down\r\nsubordination to the king, to the gentleman, to the noble, and, in\r\ngeneral, to dissolve society founded on heredity. Such phenomena are\r\nalready observable everywhere, the ruin of feeble corporations by the\r\nstate, its constant tendency to interference, to the absorption of every\r\nspecial service and the descent of power into the hands of a numerical\r\nmajority.--What plan, then, governs these societies in the way of\r\nreorganization, and, since they all belong to a common type, what are\r\nthe common resources and difficulties of adaptation? On what lines must\r\nthe metamorphosis be effected in order to arrive at a viable creations?\r\nAnd, abandoning the general problem in order to return to contemporary\r\nFrance, grown up and organized under our own eyes, how does the great\r\nmodern event affect it? How does \"this common factor combine with\r\nspecial factors, permanent and temporary,\" belong to our system? With\r\nthe French, whose hereditary spirit and character are easily defined,\r\nin this society founded on Napoleonic institutions moved by our\r\n\"administrative mechanism,\" what are the peculiar tendencies of a\r\nleveling democracy which seeks immediate establishment? Among the\r\nmaladies which are special with us--feeble birth-rate, political\r\ninstability, absence of local life, slow industrial and commercial\r\ndevelopment, despondency and pessimism--can an aptitude for\r\ntransformation which we do not possess be distinguished in the sense\r\ndemanded by the new milieu? The knowledge we have of our origins, of\r\nour psychology, of our present constitution, of our circumstances, what\r\nhopes are warranted?\r\n\r\nM. Taine could not have replied to all these questions. If, twenty years\r\nago, on the morrow after our disasters, just as we once more set about\r\na new organization, putting aside literature, art, and philosophy, noble\r\ncontemplation and pure speculation, abandoning works already projected,\r\nhe gave himself up to the technical study of law, political economy and\r\nadministrative history; if, for twenty years, he secluded himself and\r\ndevoted himself to his task--at what a cost of prolonged effort, with\r\nwhat a strain his mental faculties, with what weariness and often with\r\nwhat dissatisfaction!--if he shortened his life, it was to discharge\r\nwhat he deemed a duty to that suffering France which he loved\r\nwith tender and silent passion, the duty of aiding in her cure by\r\nestablishing the general diagnosis which a philosopher-historian\r\nwas warranted in presenting after a profound study of its vital\r\nconstitution. The examination finished, he felt that he had a right to\r\noffer the diagnosis. Not that his modesty permitted him to foretell the\r\nfuture or to dictate reforms. When his opinion was asked in relation to\r\nany reform he generally declined giving it. \"I am merely a consulting\r\nphysician,\" he would reply; \"I do not possess sufficient details on that\r\nparticular question--I am not sufficiently familiar with circumstances\r\nwhich vary from day to day.\" In effect, according to him, there is no\r\ngeneral principle from which one can deduce a series of reforms. On the\r\ncontrary, his first recommendation would have been not to try to find\r\nsimple solutions in political and social matters, but to proceed by\r\nexperiments, according to temperaments, and accepting the irregular\r\nand the incomplete.--One becomes resigned to this course by a study\r\nof history and by acquiring \"the sense of surrounding facts and\r\ndevelopments.\" Here do we find the general remedy for the destructive\r\neffects produced by the brusque progress of science, and she herself\r\nfurnishes this remedy, when, from the hasty and the theoretical, she\r\nbecomes experimental and builds on the observation of facts and their\r\nrelations. \"Through psychological narration, through the analysis of\r\npsychological conditions which have produced, maintained, or modified\r\nthis or that institution, we may find a partial solution to each\r\nquestion of reform,\" gradually discovering laws and establishing the\r\ngeneral conditions that render possible or impossible any given project.\r\nWhen constituted and then developed, reorganized, respected and applied\r\nto human affairs, the sciences of humanity may become a new instrument\r\nof power and civilization, and, just as the natural sciences have taught\r\nus to derive profit from physical forces, they may teach us to benefit\r\nby moral forces. M. Taine believed that the French were very well\r\nqualified for this order of study: if any other people possess\r\nsuperior mental faculties in respect of memory or a better knowledge\r\nof philology, he thought we had in our favor a superiority of the\r\npsychological sense.\r\n\r\nExcept for such beneficial generalities which may provide general\r\nhygienic guidelines, could M. Taine have suggested immediate remedies?\r\nIt is scarcely probable. In any even, he was not a partisan for\r\nhasty decentralization. When, under the influence of a bad system, an\r\norganization has contracted a vice that reaches its vital organs, the\r\nfollowing treatment nearly becomes mandatory;[5106] in any event, no\r\nsudden modification of it must be thought of; all that can be done is\r\nto lessen its pernicious effect by resorting to make-shift or short\r\nterm measures. Taking advantage of unforeseen circumstances, using great\r\ncircumspection, noting favorable symptoms that had impressed him--for\r\nexample a certain new birth of the spirit of association under the Third\r\nRepublic--leaving to political authorities the care \"of adjusting means\"\r\nto the diversity and mobility of things, we may believe that M. Taine\r\nwould have confined himself to indicating in what sense we could, with\r\nprudence, lay our course. To do this, it sufficed for him to sum up his\r\ndiagnosis and lay down the conditions of duration and progress. In a\r\nmatter of such vital import nobody can speak for him. Accordingly, if\r\nthe conclusion is not written, whoever knows how to read his thought may\r\ndivine it. The work, such as it is, is finished; it already contains his\r\nideas in full; the intelligent eye has only to follow them and to note\r\ntheir consequences and combination.\r\n\r\nAndré Chevrillon\r\n\r\nMenthon, St-Bernard, October, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FIFTH. THE CHURCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. MORAL INSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Napoleon's Objectives.\r\n\r\n     Centralization and moral institutions--Object of the State\r\n     in absorbing Churches.--Their influence on civil society.\r\n\r\nAfter the centralizing and invading State has taken hold of local\r\nsocieties there is nothing left for it but to cast its net over moral\r\nsocieties[5107], and this second haul is more important than the first\r\none; for, if local societies are based on the proximity of physical\r\nbodies and habitations, the latter are formed out of the accord which\r\nexists between minds and souls; in possessing these, the hold is no\r\nlonger on the outside but on the inside of man, his thought, his will;\r\nthe incentive within is laid hold of, and this directly; then only can\r\nhe be fully mastered, and disposed of at discretion. To this end, the\r\nmain purpose of the conquering State is the possession of the Churches;\r\nalongside as well as outside of itself, these are the great powers of\r\nthe nation; not only does their domain differ from its own but, again it\r\nis vaster and lies deeper. Beyond the temporal patrimony and the small\r\nfragment of human history which the eyes of the flesh perceive, they\r\nembrace and present to mental vision the whole world and its first\r\ncause, the total ordinance of things, the infinite perspective of a past\r\neternity and that of an eternity to come. Underneath the corporeal and\r\nintermittent actions which civil power prescribes and regulates, they\r\ngovern the imagination, the conscience and the affections, the whole\r\ninward being, that mute, persistent effort of which our visible acts are\r\nsimply the incomplete expressions and rare outbursts. Indeed, even when\r\nthey set limits to these, voluntarily, conscientiously, there is no\r\nlimit; in vain do they proclaim, if Christian, that their kingdom is not\r\nof this world; nevertheless, it is, since they belong to it; masters\r\nof dogma and of morals, they teach and command in it. In their\r\nall-embracing conception of divine and human things, the State, like a\r\nchapter in a book, has its place and their teachings in this chapter are\r\nfor it of capital importance. For, here do they write out its rights and\r\nduties, the rights and duties of its subjects, a more or less perfect\r\nplan of civil order. This plan, avowed or dissimulated, towards\r\nwhich they incline the preferences of the faithful, issues at length,\r\nspontaneously and invincible from their doctrine, like a plant from its\r\nseed, to vegetate in temporal society, flower and fructify therein\r\nand send its roots deeper down for the purpose of shattering or of\r\nconsolidating civil and political institutions. The influence of a\r\nChurch on the family and on education, on the use of wealth or of\r\nauthority, on the spirit of obedience or of revolt, on habits of\r\ninitiation or of inertia, of enjoyment or of abstention, of charity or\r\nof egoism, on the entire current train of daily practice and of dominant\r\nimpulses, in every branch of private or public life, is immense, and\r\nconstitutes a distinct and permanent social force of the highest order.\r\nEvery political calculation is unsound if it is omitted or treated\r\nas something of no consequence, and the head of a State is bound to\r\ncomprehend the nature of it if he would estimate its grandeur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Napoleon's opinions and methods.\r\n\r\n     Napoleon's opinions on religion and religious belief.--His\r\n     motives in preferring established and positive religions.\r\n     --Difficulty in defining the limit between spiritual and\r\n     temporal authority.--Except in Catholic countries, both\r\n     united in one hand.--Impossible to effect this union in\r\n     France arbitrarily.--Napoleon's way of attaining this end by\r\n     another process.--His intention of overcoming spiritual\r\n     authority through temporal interests.\r\n\r\nThis is what Napoleon does. As usual with him, in order to see deeper\r\ninto others, he begins by examining himself:\r\n\r\n\"To say from whence I came, what I am, or where I am going, is above my\r\ncomprehension. I am the watch that runs, but unconscious of itself.\"\r\n\r\nThese questions, which we are unable to answer,\r\n\r\n\"drive us onward to religion; we rush forward to welcome her, for\r\nthat is our natural tendency. But knowledge comes and we stop short.\r\nInstruction and history, you see, are the great enemies of religion,\r\ndisfigured by the imperfections of humanity.... I once had faith. But\r\nwhen I came to know something, as soon as I began to reason, which\r\nhappened early, at the age of thirteen, my faith staggered and became\r\nuncertain.\"[5108]\r\n\r\nThis double personal conviction is in the back-ground of his thinking,\r\nwhen he drafted the Concordat:\r\n\r\n\"It will be said that I am a papist.[5109] I am nothing. In Egypt I was\r\na Moslem; here I shall be a Catholic, for the good of the people. I\r\ndo not believe in religions. The idea of a God!\" (And then, pointing\r\nupward:) \"Who made all that?\"\r\n\r\nImagination has already decorated this great name with its legends. Let\r\nus content ourselves with those already existing; \"the restlessness of\r\nman\" is such that he cannot do without them; in default of those already\r\nmade he would fashion others, haphazard, and still more strange. The\r\npositive religions keep man from going astray; it is these which render\r\nthe supernatural definite and precise;[5110] \"he had better catch\r\nit there than pick it up at Mademoiselle Lenormand's, or with some\r\nfortune-teller or a passing charlatan.\" An established religion\r\n\r\n\"is a kind of vaccination which, in satisfying our love of the\r\nmarvelous, protects us against quacks and sorcerers;[5111] the priests\r\nare far better than the Cagliostros, Kants, and the rest of the German\r\nmystics.\"\r\n\r\nIn sum illuminism and metaphysics,[5112] speculative inventions of the\r\nbrain or of a contagious overexcitement of the nervous system, all these\r\nillusions of gullible men, are basically unhealthy, and, in general,\r\nanti-social. Nevertheless, since they are part of human nature, let us\r\naccept them like so many streams tumbling down a slope, but on condition\r\nthat they remain in their own beds and that they have many but no new\r\nones and never one bed alone for itself.\r\n\r\n\"I do not want a dominant religion, nor the establishment of new\r\nones. The Catholic, Reformed, and Lutheran systems, established by the\r\nConcordat, are sufficient.\"[5113]\r\n\r\nTheir direction and force are intelligible, and their irruptions can be\r\nguarded against. Moreover, the present inclinations and configurations\r\nof the human soil favor them; the child follows the road marked out by\r\nthe parent, and the man follows the road marked out when a child.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,[5114] last Sunday, here at Malmaison, while strolling alone in\r\nthe solitude enjoying the repose of nature, my ear suddenly caught the\r\nsound of the church-bell at Rueil. I was moved, so strong is the force\r\nof early habits and education! I said to myself, What an impression this\r\nmust make on simple, credulous people!\"\r\n\r\nLet us gratify them; let us give back these bells and the rest to the\r\nCatholics. After all, the general effect of Christianity is beneficial.\r\n\r\n\"As far as I am concerned,[5115] I do not see in it the mystery of\r\nthe incarnation, but the mystery of social order, the association of\r\nreligion with paradise, an idea of equality which keeps the rich from\r\nbeing massacred by the poor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Society[5116] could not exist without an inequality of fortunes, and an\r\ninequality of fortunes without religion.[5117] A man dying of starvation\r\nalongside of one who has abundance would not yield to this difference\r\nunless he had some authority which assured him that God so orders it\r\nthat there must be both poor and rich in the world, but that in\r\nthe future, and throughout eternity, the portion of each will be\r\nchanged.[5118]\"\r\n\r\nAlongside of the repressive police exercised by the State there is a\r\npreventive police exercised by the Church. The clergy, in its cassock,\r\nis an additional spiritual gendarmerie, much more efficient than the\r\ntemporal gendarmerie in its stout boots, while the essential thing is to\r\nmake both keep step together in concert.\r\n\r\nBetween the two domains, between that which belongs to civil authority\r\nand that which belongs to religious authority, is there any line of\r\nseparation?\r\n\r\n\"I look in vain[5119] where to place it; its existence is purely\r\nchimerical. I see only clouds, obscurities, difficulties. The civil\r\ngovernment condemns a criminal to death; the priest gives him absolution\r\nand offers him paradise.\"\r\n\r\nIn relation to this act, both powers operate publicly in an inverse\r\nsense on the same individual, one with the guillotine and the other with\r\na pardon. As these authorities may clash with each other, let us\r\nprevent conflicts and leave no undefined frontier; let us trace this out\r\nbeforehand; let us indicate what our part is and not allow the Church to\r\nencroach on the State.--The Church rally wants all; it is the accessory\r\nwhich she concedes to us, while she appropriates the principal to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\"Mark the insolence of the priests[5120] who, in sharing authority with\r\nwhat they call the temporal power, reserve to themselves all action on\r\nthe mind, the noblest part of man, and take it on themselves to reduce\r\nmy part merely to physical action. They retain the soul and fling me the\r\ncorpse!\"\r\n\r\nIn antiquity, things were much better done, and are still better done\r\nnow in Moslem countries.\r\n\r\n\"In the Roman republic,[5121] the senate was the interpreter of heaven,\r\nand this was the incentive of the force and strength of that government.\r\nIn Turkey, and throughout the Orient, the Koran serves as both a civil\r\nand religious bible. Only in Christianity do we find the pontificate\r\ndistinct from the civil government.\"\r\n\r\nAnd even this has occurred only in one branch of Christianity.\r\nEverywhere, except in Catholic countries,\r\n\r\n\"in England,[5122] in Russia, in the northern monarchies, in one part of\r\nGermany, the legal union of the two powers, the religious control in\r\nthe hands of the sovereign, 'is an accomplished fact.' One cannot govern\r\nwithout it; otherwise, the repose, dignity, and independence of a nation\r\nare disturbed at every moment.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that \"the difficulty[5123] cannot be overcome as with\r\nHenry VIII. in England. The head of the French government would then, by\r\nlegislative statute, be the supreme head of the French Church.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is repugnant to France. Napoleon often tries to\r\nbring it about, but is satisfied that in this matter \"he would never\r\nobtain national cooperation\"; once embarked,\" fully engaged in the\r\nenterprise, \"the nation would have abandoned him.\" Unable to take this\r\nroad, he takes another, which leads to the same result. As he himself\r\nafterwards states, this result \"was, for a long time and always, the\r\nobject of his wishes and mediations.... It is not his aim[5124] to\r\nchange the faith of his people; he respects spiritual objects and wants\r\nto rule them without meddling with them; his aim is to make these square\r\nwith his views, with his policy, but only through the influence of\r\ntemporal concerns.\" That spiritual authority should remain intact; that\r\nit should operate on its own speculative domain, that it to say, on\r\ndogmas, and on its practical domain, namely, on the sacraments and on\r\nworship; that is should be sovereign on this limited territory, Napoleon\r\nadmits, for such is the fact. We have only to open our eyes to see\r\nit; right or wrong, spiritual authority on this distinct domain is\r\nrecognized sovereign, obeyed, effective through the persistent, verified\r\nloyalty of believers. It cannot be done away with by supposing it\r\nnon-existent; on the contrary, a competent statesman will maintain it in\r\norder to make use of it and apply it to civil purposes. Like an engineer\r\nwho comes across a prolific spring near his factory, he will not try to\r\ndry it up, nor let the water be dispersed and lost; he has no idea\r\nof letting it remain inactive; on the contrary, he collects it, digs\r\nchannels for it, directs and economizes the flow, and renders the water\r\nserviceable in his workshops. In the Catholic Church, the authority to\r\nbe won and utilized is that of the clergy over believers and that of the\r\nsovereign pontiff over the clergy.\r\n\r\n\"You will see,\" exclaimed Bonaparte, while negotiating the Concordat,\r\n\"how I will turn the priests to account, and, first of all, the\r\nPope!\"[5125]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Dealing with the Pope.\r\n\r\n     Services which he obliges the Pope to render.--Resignation\r\n     or dismissal of the old bishops.--End of the constitutional\r\n     Church.--Right of appointing bishops and of sanctioning\r\n     curés given to the First Consul.\r\n\r\n\"Had no Pope existed,\" he says again,[5126] \"it would have been\r\nnecessary to create him for the occasion, in the same way that the Roman\r\nconsuls appointed a dictator for difficult circumstances.\" Only such a\r\ndictator could effect the coup d'état which the First Consul needed,\r\nin order to constitute the head of the new government a patron of\r\nthe Catholic Church, to bring independent or refractory priests under\r\nsubjection, to sever the canonical cord which bound the French clergy to\r\nits exiled superiors and to the old order of things, \"to break the\r\nlast thread by which the Bourbons still communicated with the country.\"\r\n\"Fifty émigré[5127] bishops in the pay of England now lead the French\r\nclergy. Their influence must be got rid of, and to do this the authority\r\nof the Pope is essential; he can dismiss or make them resign.\" Should\r\nany of them prove obstinate and unwilling to descend from their thrones,\r\ntheir refusal brings them into discredit, and they are \"designated[5128]\r\nas rebels who prefer the things of this world, their terrestrial\r\ninterests to the interests of heaven and the cause of God.\" The great\r\nbody of the clergy along with their flocks will abandon them; they will\r\nsoon be forgotten, like old sprouts transplanted whose roots have been\r\ncut off; they will die abroad, one by one, while the successor, who is\r\nnow in office, will find no difficulty in rallying the obedient around\r\nhim, for, being Catholic, his parishioners are so many sheep, docile,\r\ntaken with externals, impressionable, and ready to follow the pastoral\r\ncroisier, provided it bears the ancient trademark, consists of the same\r\nmaterial, is of the same form, conferred from on high and sent from\r\nRome. The bishops having once been consecrated by the Pope, nobody save\r\na Gregory or some antiquarian canonist will dispute their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical ground is thus cleared through the interposition of\r\nthe Pope. The three groups of authorities thereon which contend with\r\neach other for the possession of consciences[5129]--the refugee bishops\r\nin England, the apostolic vicars, and the constitutional clergy--\r\ndisappear, and now the cleared ground can be built on. \"The Catholic\r\nreligion being declared[5130] that of the majority of the French people,\r\nits services must now be regulated. The First Consul nominates fifty\r\nbishops whom the Pope consecrates. These appoint the curés, and the\r\nstate pays their salaries. The latter may be sworn, while the priests\r\nwho do not submit are sent out of the country. Those who preach against\r\nthe government are handed over to their superiors for punishment. The\r\nPope confirms the sale of clerical possessions; he consecrates the\r\nRepublic.\" The faithful no longer regard it askance. They feel that\r\nthey are not only tolerated, but protected by it, and they are\r\ngrateful.[5131] The people recover their churches, their curés, the\r\nforms of worship to which they are almost instinctively accustomed, the\r\nceremonial which, to their imagination, belongs to every important act\r\nof their lives, the solemn rites of marriage, baptism, burial, and\r\nother sacramental offices.--Henceforth mass is said every Sunday in each\r\nvillage, and the peasants enjoy their processions on Corpus-Christi\r\nday, when their crops are blessed. A great public want is satisfied.\r\nDiscontent subsides, ill-will dies out, the government has fewer\r\nenemies; its enemies, again, lose their best weapon, and, at the same\r\ntime, it acquires an admirable one, the right of appointing bishops and\r\nof sanctioning the curés. By virtue of the Concordat and by order of the\r\nPope, not only, in 1801, do all former spiritual authorities cease\r\nto exist, but again, after 1801, all new titularies, with the Pope's\r\nassent, chosen, accepted, managed, disciplined,[5132] and paid by\r\nthe First Consul, are, in fact, his creatures, and become his\r\nfunctionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The Pope, Napoleon's employee.\r\n\r\n     Other services expected of the Pope.--Coronation of Napoleon\r\n     at Notre-Dame.--Napoleonic theory of the Empire and the Holy\r\n     See.--The Pope a feudatory and subject of the Emperor.\r\n     --The pope installed as a functionary at Paris, and\r\n     arch-chancellor on spiritual matters.--Effect of this for Italy.\r\n\r\nOver and above this positive and real service obtained from the\r\nsovereign pontiff, he awaits others yet more important and undefined,\r\nand principally his future coronation in Notre Dame. Already, during the\r\nnegotiations for the Concordat, La Fayette had observed to him with a\r\nsmile:[5133] \"You want the holy oil dropped on your head\"; to which he\r\nmade no contradictory answer. On the contrary, he replied, and probably\r\ntoo with a smile: \"We shall see! We shall see!\" Thus does he think\r\nahead, and his ideas extend beyond that which a man belonging to the\r\nancient régime could imagine or divine, even to the reconstruction of\r\nthe empire of the west as this existed in the year 800. \"I am not Louis\r\nXIV.'s successor,\" he soon declares,[5134] \"but of Charlemagne.... I am\r\nCharlemagne, because, like Charlemagne, I unite the French crown to\r\nthat of the Lombards, and my empire borders on the Orient.\" In this\r\nconception, which a remote history furnishes to his boundless ambition,\r\nthe terrible antiquitarian finds the gigantic and suitable framework,\r\nthe potent, specious terms, and all the verbal reasons he requires.\r\nUnder Napoleon, the successor of Charlemagne, the Pope can be only a\r\nvassal: \"Your Holiness is the sovereign of Rome, but I am its emperor,\"\r\nthe legitimate suzerain. \"Provided with \"fiefs and counties\" by this\r\nsuzerain, the Pope owes him political fealty and military aid; failing\r\nin this, the endowment, which is conditional, lapses and his confiscated\r\nestates return to the imperial domain to which they have never ceased to\r\nbelong.[5135] Through this reasoning and this threat, through the rudest\r\nand most adroit moral and physical pressure, the most insidious and most\r\npersevering, through spoliation, begun, continued and completed by the\r\nabduction, captivity and sequestration of the Holy Father himself, he\r\nundertakes the subjection of the spiritual power: not only must the\r\nPope be like any other individual in the empire,[5136] subject by his\r\nresidence to territorial laws, and hence to the government and the\r\ngendarmerie, but again he must come within the administrative lines;\r\nhe will no longer enjoy the right of refusing canonical investiture to\r\nbishops appointed by the emperor,[5137] \"he will, on his coronation,\r\nswear not to take any measures against the four propositions of the\r\nGallican Church,\"[5138] he will become a grand functionary, a sort of\r\narch-chancellor like Cambacérès and Lebrun, the arch chancellor of the\r\nCatholic cult.--Undoubtedly, he resists and is obstinate, but he is not\r\nimmortal, and if he does not yield, his successor will: it suffices to\r\nchoose one that is manageable, and to this end things work in the next\r\nconclave.\r\n\r\n\"With my influence and our forces in Italy,\" Napoleon says\r\nafterwards,[5139] \"I did not despair, sooner or later, by one means\r\nor another, of obtaining for myself the control of the Pope, and,\r\nthenceforward, what an influence, what a lever on the opinion of the\r\nrest of the world!\"\r\n\r\n\"Had I returned victorious from Moscow, I intended to exalt the Pope\r\nbeyond measure, to surround him with pomp and deference. I would have\r\nbrought him to no longer regretting his temporality; I would have made\r\nhim an idol. He would have lived alongside of me. Paris would have\r\nbecome the capital of Christendom, and I would have governed the\r\nreligious world the same as the political world.... I would have had\r\nmy religious as well as legislative sessions; my councils would have\r\nrepresented Christianity; the Popes would have been merely their\r\npresidents. I would have opened and closed these assemblies,\r\nsanctioned and published their decrees, as was done by Constantine and\r\nCharlemagne.\" In 1809, the restoration of the great Carlovingian and\r\nRoman edifice had begun; its physical foundations were laid. By virtue\r\nof a decree,[5140] \"the expenses of the Sacred College and of the\r\nPropaganda were declared imperial.\" The Pope, like the new dukes and\r\nmarshals, was endowed with a landed income on \"property in different\r\nparts of the empire, two millions of rural revenue free of all taxation.\r\n\"Necessarily\" the Pope must have two palaces, one at Paris and the other\r\nat Rome. He is already nearly fully installed in Paris, his person being\r\nall that was lacking. On arriving from Fontainebleau, two hours off, he\r\nwould find everything belonging to his office; \"the papers[5141] of the\r\nmissions and the archives of Rome were already there.\" \"The Hôtel Dieu\r\nwas entirely given up to the departments of the court of Rome. The\r\ndistrict around Notre Dame and the Ile Saint-Louis was to be the\r\nheadquarters of Christendom!\" Rome, the second center of Christendom,\r\nand the second residence of the Pope, is declared[5142] \"an imperial and\r\nfree city, the second city of the empire\"; a prince of the empire, or\r\nother grand dignitary, is to reside there and \"hold the court of the\r\nemperor.\" \"After their coronation in the cathedral of Notre Dame at\r\nParis, the emperors\" will go to Italy before the tenth year of their\r\nreign, and be \"crowned in the church of St. Peter at Rome.\" The heir to\r\nthe imperial throne \"will bear the title and receive the honors of\r\nthe King of Rome.\" Observe the substantial features of this chimerical\r\nconstruction. Napoleon, far more Italian than French, Italian by race,\r\ninstinct, imagination, and souvenirs, considers in his plan the future\r\nof Italy, and, on casting up the final accounts of his reign, we\r\nfind that the net profit is for Italy and the net loss is for France.\r\n\"Napoleon wanted to create the Italian kingdom over again,[5143]\r\ncombining Piedmont, Tuscany, etc., in one united independent nation,\r\nbounded by the Alps and the sea.... This was to be the immortal trophy\r\nerected in his honor.... He awaited impatiently the birth of a second\r\nson that he might take him to Rome, crown him King of Italy and proclaim\r\nthe independence of the great peninsula under the regency of Prince\r\nEugene.\" Since Theodoric and the Lombard kings, it is the Pope who,\r\nin preserving his temporal sovereignty and spiritual omnipotence, has\r\nmaintained the sub-divisions of Italy; let this obstacle be removed and\r\nItaly will once more become a nation. Napoleon prepares the way,\r\nand constitutes it beforehand by restoring the Pope to his primitive\r\ncondition, by withdrawing from him his temporal sovereignty and limiting\r\nhis spiritual omnipotence, by reducing him to the position of managing\r\ndirector of Catholic consciences and head minister of the principal cult\r\nauthorized in the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. State domination of all religion.\r\n\r\n     Services which Napoleon desires or expects from the French\r\n     clergy.--His Roman idea of civil power.--Development of this\r\n     conception by the jurists.--Every religious association must\r\n     be authorized.--Legal statutes which fix the doctrine and\r\n     discipline of the four authorized Churches.--Legal\r\n     organization of the Catholic Church.--Its doctrine and\r\n     discipline to be that of the old Gallican Church.--New\r\n     situation of the French Church and new rôle of civil power.\r\n     --It sets aside its ancient obligations.--It retains and\r\n     augments its regalian rights.--The Church of France before\r\n     1789 and after 1802.--Increased preponderance and complete\r\n     dominion of the civil power.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out this plan, he will use the French clergy in mastering\r\nthe Pope, as the Pope has been made use of in mastering the French\r\nclergy. To this end, before completing the Concordat and decreeing the\r\nOrganic Articles, he orders for himself a small library, consisting of\r\nbooks on ecclesiastical law. The Latin works of Bossuet are translated\r\nfor him, and he has drawn up an exposition of the Gallican parliamentary\r\ndoctrine. The first thing is to go down to the roots of the subject,\r\nwhich he does with extraordinary facility, and then, recasting and\r\nshaping all theories to suit himself, he arrives at an original,\r\nindividual conception, at once coherent, precise, and practical; one\r\nwhich covers the Cæsar and which he applies alike to all churches,\r\nCatholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, and even Jewish, to every religious\r\ncommunity now existing and in time to come. His master-idea is that\r\nof the Roman legists and of ancient imperial jurisprudence; here, as\r\nelsewhere, the modern Cæsar goes back beyond his Christian predecessors\r\nto Constantine, and farther still, to Trajan and Augustus.[5144] So long\r\nas belief remains silent and solitary, confined within the limits of\r\nindividual conscience, it is free, and the State has nothing to do with\r\nit. But let it transgress these limits, address the public, bring people\r\ntogether in crowds for a common purpose, manifest itself openly, it is\r\nsubject to control; forms of worship, ceremonies, preaching, instruction\r\nand propaganda, the donations it calls forth, the assemblies it\r\nconvenes, the organization and maintenance of the bodies it engenders,\r\nall the positive applications of the inward reverie, are temporal works.\r\nIn this sense, they form a province of the public domain, and come\r\nwithin the competency of the government, of the administration and\r\nof the courts. The State has a right to interdict, to tolerate, or\r\nto authorize them, and always to give them proper direction. Sole and\r\nuniversal proprietor of the outward realm in which single consciences\r\nmay communicate with each other, it intervenes, step by step, either to\r\ntrace or to bar the way; the road they follow passes over its ground and\r\nbelongs to it; its watch, accordingly, over their proceedings is, and\r\nshould be, daily; and it maintains this watch for its own advantage,\r\nfor the advantage of civil and political interests, in such a way that\r\nconcern for the other world may be serviceable and not prejudicial to\r\nmatters which belong to this one. In short, and as a summary, the First\r\nConsul says, in a private conversation:\r\n\r\n\"The people want a religion, and this religion should be in the hands of\r\nthe government!\"[5145]\r\n\r\nOn this theme, his jurists, old parliamentarians or conventionalists,\r\nhis ministers and counselors, Gallicans or Jacobins, his spokesmen in\r\nthe legislative assembly or the tribunate, all imbued with Roman law\r\nor with the Contrat Social are capital megaphones for proclaiming the\r\nomnipotence of the State in polished sentences. \"The unity of public\r\npower and its universality,\" says Portalis,[5146] \"are a\r\nnecessary consequence of its independence.\" \"Public power must be\r\nself-sufficient; it is nothing if not all...\" Public power cannot\r\ntolerate rivals; it cannot allow other powers to establish themselves\r\nalongside of it without its consent, perhaps to sap and weaken it. \"The\r\nauthority of a State might become precarious if men on its territory\r\nexercise great influence over minds and consciences, unless these men\r\nbelong to it, at least in some relation.\" It is careless \"if it remains\r\nunfamiliar or indifferent to the form and the constitution of the\r\ngovernment which proposes to govern souls,\" if it admits that the limits\r\nwithin which the faith and obedience of believers \"can be made or\r\naltered without its support, if it has not, in its legally recognized\r\nand avowed superiors, guarantees of the fidelity of inferiors.\" Such was\r\nthe rule in France for the Catholic cult previous to 1789, and such is\r\nto be the rule, after 1801, for all authorized cults. If the State\r\nauthorizes them, it is \"to direct such important institutions with a\r\nview to the greatest public utility.\" Solely because it is favorable to\r\n\"their doctrine and their discipline\" it means to maintain these intact\r\nand prevent \"their ministers from corrupting the doctrine entrusted to\r\ntheir teaching, or from arbitrarily throwing off the yoke of discipline,\r\nto the great prejudice of individuals and the State.\"[5147] Hence, in\r\nthe legal statute by which a Church is incorporated and realizes what\r\nshe is, it states in precise terms what it exacts or permits her to be;\r\nhenceforward she shall be this or that and so remain; her dogmas and her\r\ncanons, her hierarchy and her internal regime, her territorial\r\nsubdivisions and circumscriptions, her regular or casual sources of\r\nincome, her teachings and her liturgy are definite things and fixed\r\nlimitations. No ecclesiastical assembly, Protestant, Catholic, or\r\nIsraelite, shall formulate or publish any doctrinal or disciplinary\r\ndecision without the government's approbation.[5148] No ecclesiastical\r\nassembly, Protestant, Catholic, or Israelite, shall be held without the\r\napproval of the government. All sacerdotal authorities, bishops and\r\ncurés, pastors and ministers of both Protestant confessions,\r\nconsistorial inspectors and presidents of the Augsbourg Confession,\r\nnotables of each Israelite circumscription, members of each Israelite\r\nconsistory, members of the central Israelite consistory, rabbis and\r\ngrand-rabbis, shall be appointed or accepted by the government and paid\r\nby it through an executory\" decision of its prefects. All the professors\r\nof Protestant or Catholic seminaries shall be appointed and paid by the\r\ngovernment. Whatever the seminary, whether Protestant or Catholic, its\r\nestablishment, its regulations, its internal management, the object and\r\nspirit of its studies, shall be submitted to the approval of the\r\ngovernment. In each cult, a distinct, formulated, official doctrine\r\nshall govern the teaching, preaching, and public or special instruction\r\nof every kind; this, for the Israelite cult, is\" the doctrine expressed\r\nby the decisions of the grand Sanhedrin\";[5149] for the two Protestant\r\ncults, the doctrine of the Confession of Augsbourg, taught in the two\r\nseminaries of the East, and the doctrine of the Reformed Church taught\r\nin the Genevan seminary;[5150] for the Catholic cult, the maxims of the\r\nGallican Church, the declaration, in 1682, of the assembly of the\r\nclergy[5151] and the four famous propositions depriving the Pope of any\r\nauthority over sovereigns in temporal matters, subordinating the Pope to\r\necumenical councils in ecclesiastical and spiritual concerns, and which,\r\nin the government of the French Church, limit the authority of the Pope\r\nto ancient usages or canons inherited by that Church and accepted by the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the ascendancy of the State, in ecclesiastical matters,\r\nincreases beyond all measure and remains without any counterpoise.\r\nInstead of one Church, it maintains four, while the principal one, the\r\nCatholic, comprising 33 million followers, and more dependent than under\r\nthe old monarchy, loses the privileges which once limited or compensated\r\nit for its subjection.--Formerly the prince was its temporal head, on\r\ncondition that he should be its exterior arm, that it should have the\r\nmonopoly of education and the censorship of books, that he should use\r\nhis strong arm against heretics, schismatics and free-thinkers. Of all\r\nthese obligations which kings accepted, the new sovereign frees himself,\r\nand yet, with the Holy See, he holds on to the same prerogatives and,\r\nwith the Church, the same rights as his predecessors. He is just as\r\nminutely dictatorial as formerly with regard to the details of\r\nworship. Sometimes he fixes the fees and perquisites of the priests\r\nfor administering the sacraments: \"This charge is a purely civil and\r\ntemporal operation, since it resolves itself into a levy of so many\r\npence on the citizen. Bishops and priests should not be allowed to\r\ndecide here.[5152] The government alone must remain the arbiter\r\nbetween the priest who receives and the person who pays.\" Sometimes,\r\nhe intervenes in the publication of plenary indulgence: \"It is\r\nessential[5153] that indulgences should not be awarded for causes which\r\nmight be contrary to public order or to the welfare of the country; the\r\npolitical magistrate is equally interested in knowing what the authority\r\nis that grants indulgences; if its title to act is legal, to what\r\npersons indulgences are granted, what persons are entrusted with their\r\ndistribution, and what persons are to fix the term and duration of\r\nextraordinary prayers.\"--Thus bound and held by the State, the Church is\r\nsimply one of its appendices, for its own free roots by which, in this\r\nclose embrace, it still vegetates and keeps erect have all been cut off\r\nshort; torn from the soil and grafted on the State, they derive their\r\nsap and their roots from the civil powers. Before 1789, the clergy\r\nformed a distinct order in temporal society and, above all others, a\r\nbody possessing property and exempt from taxes, a tax-payer apart which,\r\nrepresented in periodical assemblies, negotiated every five years\r\nwith the King himself, granted him subsidies and, in exchange for this\r\n\"disinterested gift,\" secured for itself concessions or confirmations of\r\nimmunities, prerogatives and favors. Today, it is merely a collection\r\nof ordinary individuals and subjects, even less than that--an\r\nadministrative staff similar to that of the university, of the\r\nmagistrature, of the treasury, and of the woods and forests, even more\r\nclosely watched and bridled, with more detailed precautions and stricter\r\ninterdictions. Before 1789, the curés and other second-class officials\r\nwere, for the most part, selected and installed without the prince's\r\nintervention, sometimes by the bishop of the diocese or a neighboring\r\nabbé, sometimes by independent collators, by the titular himself,[5154]\r\nby a lay patron or a chapter, by a commune, by an indultaire, by the\r\npope, while the salary of each titular, large or small, was his private\r\nproperty, the annual product of a piece of land or of some indebtedness\r\nattached to his office and which he administered. Nowadays, every\r\nincumbent, from the cardinal-archbishop down to a canon, cantonal curé,\r\nand director or teacher in a seminary, is appointed or accepted by the\r\ncivil power to which he swears fidelity. His salary, set down in the\r\nbudget, is simply that of a public employee, so many francs and centimes\r\nfor which he comes monthly to the office of the treasury paymaster,\r\nalong with others of his colleagues who are employed by the State in\r\nnon-Catholic cults, together with others, his quasi-colleagues,\r\nwhom the State employs in the university, in the magistrature, in the\r\ngendarmerie, and in the police.[5155] Such, in all branches of social\r\nlife, is the universal and final effect of the Revolution. In the\r\nChurch, as elsewhere, it has extended the interference and preponderance\r\nof the State, not inadvertently but intentionally, not accidentally\r\nbut on principle.[5156] \"The Constituent\" (Assembly), says Siméon,\r\n\"had rightly recognized that, religion being one of the oldest and most\r\npowerful means of government, it was necessary to bring it more than\r\nit had been under the control of the government.\" Hence, the civil\r\nconstitution of the clergy; \"its only mistake was not to reconcile\r\nitself with the Pope.\" At present, thanks to the agreement between Pope\r\nand government (Napoleon, First Consul), the new régime completes\r\nthe work of the ancient régime and, in the Church as elsewhere, the\r\ndomination of the centralizing State is complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Napoleon Executes the Concordat.\r\n\r\n     Reasons for suppressing the regular clergy.--Authorized\r\n     religious associations.--The authorization revocable.\r\n\r\nThese are the grand lines of the new ecclesiastical establishment, and\r\nthe general connections by which the Catholic Church, like an apartment\r\nin a building, finds itself included in and incorporated with the State.\r\nIt need not disconnect itself under the pretext of making itself more\r\ncomplete; there it is, built and finished; it cannot add to or go beyond\r\nthis; no collateral and supplementary constructions are requisite which,\r\nthrough their independence, would derange the architectural whole, no\r\nmonastic congregations, no body of regular clergy; the secular clergy\r\nsuffices. \"Never[5157] has it been contested that the public power had\r\nthe right to dissolve arbitrary institutions which do not insist on the\r\nessence of religion and which are judged suspicious or troublesome to\r\nthe State.\" As a principle, all religious communities should be judged\r\nin this way; for they are spontaneous bodies; they form their own\r\norganization, and without the aid of the State, through the free will\r\nof their members; they live apart, according to the proper and peculiar\r\nstatute which they adopt, outside of lay society, alongside of the\r\nestablished Church, under distinct chiefs chosen by themselves,\r\nsometimes under foreign ones, all more or less independent, all, through\r\ninterest and by instinct, gathered around the Holy See, which, against\r\ndiocesan authority and episcopal jurisdiction, serves them as protector.\r\nFormerly, the monks[5158] formed the Pope's militia; they recognized\r\nno other sovereign, and thus were they more to be feared by governments\r\nthan the secular clergy. The latter, without them, \"would never have\r\ncaused embarrassment;\" henceforth there will be no other body.[5159] \"I\r\nwant bishops, curés, vicars, and that's all! Religious communities have\r\nbeen allowed to re-establish themselves against my instructions;--I am\r\ninformed that, at Beauvais, the Jesuits have formed establishments under\r\nthe name of the Fathers of Faith. It should not be allowed\"--and he\r\nprohibits it by decree.[5160] He dissolves \"all associations formed\r\nunder the pretext of religion and unauthorized.\" He decides that, in\r\nfuture, \"no aggregation or association of men or of women shall be\r\nformed under pretext of religion unless formally authorized;\" he enjoins\r\nthe prosecuting attorneys of his courts \"to prosecute even by extra\r\nproceedings all persons of both sexes who directly or indirectly\r\nviolate this decree.\" He reserves to himself, however, the faculty\r\nof authorizing communities by which he can profit, and, in fact, he\r\nauthorizes several of these as instruments which society needs, or\r\nwhich are useful to the State, especially nursing or teaching sisters\r\nof charity,[5161] the brethren of Christian schools,[5162] and, first\r\nin rank, the Lazarists and the Fathers of foreign missions.[5163] \"These\r\nmonks,\" he says,[5164] will be of great service in Asia, in Africa, and\r\nin America. I will send them to procure information on the state of the\r\ncountry. Their robe protects them, while it is a cover to political\r\nand commercial designs.... I will allow them a capital to start with\r\nof 15,000 francs rental.... They cost little, are respected by savages,\r\nand, having no official character, can not compromise the government.\"\r\nMoreover, \"religious zeal leads them to undertake work and to face\r\nperils which are beyond the strength of a civil agent.\"--Of course, as\r\nthey are \"secret diplomatic agents,\" the government must keep them\r\nin hand and direct them. Consequently, \"their superior must no longer\r\nreside in Rome, but at Paris.\" The same precaution is taken with\r\nreference to other congregations, which, in teaching or in charity,\r\nbecome regular auxiliaries of the lay power. \"The general-superior of\r\nthe Sisters of Charity will live in Paris[5165]; the entire body will\r\nthen be in the hands of the government.\" As to the brethren of the\r\nChristian schools, Napoleon absorbs these in his university.[5166] \"They\r\nmust be licensed by the grand-master,[5167] who will certify to their\r\ninternal regulations, accept their oaths, prescribe a special costume,\r\nand superintend their schools.\" Observe the exigencies of the government\r\nat this point, its measures for controlling the religious orders\r\nauthorized by it. Abbé Hanon,[5168] the common superior of the Sisters\r\nof Saint-Vincent de Paul, having refused to place Madame Lætitia\r\n(Napoleon's mother) at the head of the council of the order, is carried\r\noff at night and shut up at Fenestrelles,[5169] while the Sisters,\r\nwho, following the instructions of their founder, refuse to recognize a\r\nsuperior appointed by the civil power, are treated in the same manner as\r\nformerly the nuns of Port-Royal.[5170]\r\n\r\n\"It is time to put an end to this scandal of the Sisters of Charity in\r\nrebellion against their superiors. It is my intention to suppress all\r\nthe houses which, in twenty-four hours after the notice you give them,\r\ndo not return to subordination. You will replace the houses suppressed,\r\nnot by Sisters of the same order, but by those of another order of\r\ncharity. The Sisters at Paris will lose their influence, which will be a\r\ngood thing.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever the communities may be, the authorization by which they\r\norganize is merely a favor, and every favor granted may be withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\"I will have no more missions of any kind.[5171] I established\r\nmissionaries in Paris and gave them a house: I cancel it all. I am\r\ncontent with religion at home; I do not care to spread it abroad... . I\r\nmake you responsible if (in a month from this) on the first of October\r\nthere are any missions or congregations still existing in France.\"--\r\n\r\nThus does the regular clergy live, under a revocable title, by\r\ntoleration, despotically, suspended by a thread which, perhaps to-\r\nmorrow, may be cut at the masters pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. System to which the regular clergy is subject.\r\n\r\n     System to which the regular clergy is subject.--Restoration\r\n     and application of Gallican doctrines.--Gallicanism and\r\n     submission of the new ecclesiastical staff.--Measures taken\r\n     to insure the obedience of the existing clergy and that of\r\n     the clergy in the future.--Seminaries.--Small number of\r\n     these allowed.--Conditions granted to them.--Proceedings\r\n     against suspicious teachers and undisciplined pupils.\r\n\r\nThe secular clergy remains, better protected, it seems, and by a less\r\nprecarious statute, for this statute is an international and diplomatic\r\nact, a solemn and bilateral treaty which binds the French government,\r\nnot only to itself but to another government, to an independent\r\nsovereign and the recognized head of the whole Catholic\r\nChurch.--Consequently, it is of prime importance to rebuild and raise\r\nhigher the barriers which, in ancient France, separated the secular\r\nclergy from the Pope, the customs and regulations which constituted\r\nthe Gallican Church a province apart in the Church universal, the\r\necclesiastic franchises and servitudes which restricted the Pope's\r\njurisdiction in order that the jurisdiction of the king might be\r\nextended. All these servitudes to the advantage of the lay sovereign,\r\nand all these franchises to the prejudice of the ecclesiastic sovereign,\r\nare maintained and increased by the new statute. By virtue of the\r\nConcordat and by consent of the Pope, the First Consul acquires the\r\nsame rights and privileges in relation to the Holy See as the old\r\ngovernment,\"[5172] that is to say the same exclusive right to nominate\r\nfuture French cardinals and to have as many as before in the sacred\r\ncollege, the same right to exclude in the sacred conclave, the same\r\nfaculty of being the unique dispenser in France of high ecclesiastical\r\nplaces and the prerogative of appointing all the bishops and archbishops\r\non French territory. And better still, by virtue of the Organic Articles\r\nand in spite of the Pope's remonstrances, he interposes, as with the\r\nformer kings, his authority, his Council of State and his tribunals\r\nbetween the Holy See and the faithful. \"No bull, brief, rescript,\r\ndecree... of the court of Rome, even when bearing only on individuals,\r\nshall be received, published, printed or otherwise executed without\r\npermission of the government. No person, bearing the title of apostolic\r\nnuncio, legate, vicar or commissioner, ... shall, without the same\r\nauthorization, exercise on the French soil or elsewhere any function\r\nin relation to the interests of the Gallican Church.... All cases of\r\ncomplaint by ecclesiastical superiors and other persons shall be brought\r\nbefore the Council of State.\"[5173] Every minister of a cult[5174] who\r\nshall have carried on a correspondence with a foreign court on religious\r\nmatters or questions without having previously informed the Minister of\r\nWorship and obtained his sanction shall, for this act alone, be subject\r\nto a penalty of from one hundred to five hundred francs and imprisonment\r\nduring a term of from one month to two years. Every communication from\r\nhigh to low and from low to high between the French Church and its Roman\r\nhead, cut off at will, intervention by a veto or by approval of all\r\nacts of pontifical authority, to be the legal and recognized head of\r\nthe national clergy,[5175] to become for this clergy an assistant,\r\ncollateral, and lay Pope--such was the pretension of the old government,\r\nand such, in effect, is the sense, the juridical bearing, of the\r\nGallican maxims.[5176] Napoleon pro-claims them anew, while the edict\r\nof 1682, by which Louis XIV. applied them with precision, rigor and\r\nminuteness, \"is declared the general law of the empire.\"[5177]\r\n\r\nThere are no opponents to this doctrine, or this use of it, in France.\r\nNapoleon counts on not encountering any, and especially among his\r\nprelates. Gallican before 1789, the whole clergy were more or less so\r\nthrough education and tradition, through interest and through pride;\r\nnow, the survivors of this clergy are those who provide the new\r\necclesiastical staff, and, of the two distinct groups from which it\r\nis recruited, neither is predisposed by its antecedents to become\r\nultramontane. Some among these, who have emigrated, partisans of the\r\nancient régime, find no difficulty in thus returning to old habits and\r\ndoctrines, the authoritative protectorate of the State over the Church,\r\nthe interference of the Emperor substituted for that of the King, and\r\nNapoleon, in this as in other respects, the legitimate, or legitimated,\r\nsuccessor of the Bourbons. The others, who have sworn to the civil\r\nconstitution of the clergy, the schismatics, the impenitent and, in\r\nspite of the Pope, reintegrated by the First Consul in the Church,[5178]\r\nare ill-disposed towards the Pope, their principal adversary, and\r\nwell-disposed towards the First Consul, their unique patron. Hence,\r\n\"the heads[5179] of the Catholic clergy, that is to say, the bishops and\r\ngrand-vicars,... are attached to the government;\" they are \"enlightened\"\r\npeople, and can be made to listen to reason.\r\n\r\n\"But we have three or four thousand curés or vicars, the progeny of\r\nignorance and dangerous through their fanaticism and their passions.\"\r\n\r\nIf these and their superiors show any undisciplined tendencies, the\r\ncurb must be tightly drawn. Fournier, a priest, having reflected on the\r\ngovernment from his pulpit in Saint-Roch, is arrested by the police,\r\nput in Bicêtre as mad,[5180] and the First Consul replies to the Paris\r\nclergy who claim his release \"in a well-drawn-up petition,\":\r\n\r\n\"I wanted[5181] to prove to you, when I put my cap on the wrong side\r\nout, that priests must obey the civil power.\"\r\n\r\nNow and then, a rude stroke of this sort sets an example and keeps the\r\nintractable on the right path who would otherwise be tempted to leave\r\nit. At Bayonne, concerning a clerical epistle in which an ill-sounding\r\nphrase occurs, \"the grand-vicar who drew it up is sent to Pignerol for\r\nten years, and I think that the bishop is exiled.\"[5182]\r\n\r\nAt Séez, when constitutional priests are in disfavor, the bishop is\r\ncompelled to resign on the instant, while Abbé Langlois, his principal\r\ncounsellor, taken by the gendarmes, led to Paris from police station\r\nto police station, is shut up in La Force, in secret confinement, with\r\nstraw for a bed, during fourteen days, then imprisoned in Vincennes for\r\nnine months, so that, finally, seized with paralysis, he is transferred\r\nto an insane retreat, where he remains a prisoner up to the end of the\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nLet us provide for the future as well as for the present, and, beyond\r\nthe present clergy, let us train the future clergy. The seminaries will\r\nanswer this purpose: \"Public ones must be organized[5183] so that\r\nthere may be no clandestine seminaries, such as formerly existed in the\r\ndepartments of Calvados, Morbihan and many others;... the formation of\r\nyoung priests must not be left to ignorance and fanaticism.\"--\"Catholic\r\nschools need the surveillance of the government.\"--There is to be one of\r\nthese in each metropolitan district, and \"this special school must be\r\nin the hands of the authorities.\"--\"The directors and teachers shall\r\nbe appointed by the First Consul\"; men will be placed there who are\r\n\"cultivated, devoted to the government and friendly to toleration; they\r\nwill not confine themselves to teaching theology, but will add to this\r\na sort of philosophy and correct worldliness.\"--A future curé, a priest\r\nwho controls laymen and belongs to his century, must not be a monk\r\nbelonging to the other world, but a man of this world, able to adapt\r\nhimself to it, do his duty in it with propriety and discretion, accept\r\nthe legal establishment of which he is a part, not damn his Protestant\r\nneighbors, Jews or freethinkers too openly, be a useful member of\r\ntemporal society and a loyal subject of the civil power; let him be\r\na Catholic and pious, but within just limits; he shall not be an\r\nultramontanist or a bigot.--Precautions are taken to this effect. No\r\nseminarist may become subdeacon without the consent of the government,\r\nand the list of ordinations each year, sent to him at Paris by the\r\nbishop, is returned, cut down to the strictly necessary.[5184] From the\r\nvery beginning, and in express terms,[5185] Napoleon has reserved all\r\ncuracies and vicarages for \"ecclesiastics pensioned by virtue of the\r\nlaws of the Constituent Assembly.\" Not only, through this confusion\r\nbetween pension and salary, does he lighten a pecuniary burden, but\r\nhe greatly prefers old priests to young ones; many of them have been\r\nconstitutionnels, and all are imbued with Gallicanism; it is he who has\r\nbrought them back from exile or saved them from oppression, and they\r\nare grateful for it; having suffered long and patiently, they are weary,\r\nthey must have grown wiser, and they will be manageable. Moreover,\r\nhe has precise information about each one; their past conduct is a\r\nguarantee of their future conduct; he never chooses one of them with his\r\neyes shut. On the contrary, the candidates for ordination are strangers,\r\nthe government which accepts them knows nothing about them except that,\r\nat the age when the fever of growth or of the imagination takes a fixed\r\nform, they have been subject for five years to a theological education\r\nand to a cloistral life. The chances are that, with them, the\r\nfeverishness of youth will end in the heat of conviction and in the\r\nprejudices of inexperience; in this event, the government which exempts\r\nthem from the conscription to admit them in the Church exchanges a good\r\nmilitary recruit for a bad ecclesiastical recruit; in place of a servant\r\nit creates an opponent. Hence, during the fifteen years of his reign,\r\nNapoleon authorizes only six thousand new ordinations,[5186] in all\r\nfour hundred per annum, one hundred for each diocese or six or seven per\r\nannum. Meanwhile, by his university decrees, he lets lay daylight into\r\nclerical enclosures[5187] and shuts the door of all ecclesiastical\r\ndignities to suspicious priests.[5188] For more security, in every\r\ndiocese in which \"the principles of the bishop\" do not give him full\r\nsatisfaction, he prohibits all ordination, nomination, promotion, or\r\nfavor whatever. \"I have stricken off[5189] all demands relating to the\r\nbishoprics of Saint-Brieuc, Bordeaux, Ghent, Tournay, Troyes and the\r\nMaritime Alps.... My intention is that you do not, for these dioceses,\r\npropose to me any exemption of service for conscripts, no nominations\r\nfor scholarships, for curacies, or for canonries. You will send in a\r\nreport on the dioceses which it would be well to strike with this ban.\"\r\nTowards the end, the Gallicism of Bossuet no longer suffices for him; he\r\nallowed it to be taught at Saint-Sulpice, and M. Emery, director of this\r\ninstitution, was the priest in France whom he esteemed the most and\r\nmost willingly consulted; but a pupil's imprudent letter had been just\r\nintercepted, and, accordingly, the spirit of that association is a\r\nbad one. An order of expulsion of the director is issued and the\r\ninstallation in his place of a new one \"day after to-morrow,\" as well as\r\nnew administrators of whom none shall be Sulpician.[5190] \"Take measures\r\nto have this congregation dissolved. I will have no Sulpicians in the\r\nseminary of Paris.[5191] Let me know the seminaries that are served\r\nby Sulpicians in order that they too may be sent away from these\r\nseminaries.\"[5192]--And let the seminarists who have been badly taught\r\nby their masters take heed not to practice in their own behalf the\r\nfalse doctrines which the State proscribes; especially, let them\r\nnever undertake, as they do in Belgium, to disobey the civil power in\r\ndeference to the Pope and their bishop. At Tournay,[5193] all those over\r\neighteen years of age are sent to Magdebourg; at Ghent, the very young\r\nor those not fit for military service are put in Saint-Pelagie; the\r\nrest, two hundred and thirty-six in number, including forty deacons or\r\nsub-deacons, incorporated in an artillery brigade, set out for Wesel, a\r\ncountry of marshes and fevers, where fifty of them soon die of epidemics\r\nand contagion.--There is ever the same terminal procedure; to Abbé\r\nd'Astros, suspected of having received and kept a letter of the Pope,\r\nNapoleon, with threats, gave him this ecclesiastical watchword:\r\n\r\n\"I have heard that the liberties of the Gallican Church are being\r\ntaught: but for all that, I wear the sword, so watch out!\"\r\n\r\nSo behind all his institutions one discovers the military sanction, the\r\narbitrary punishment, physical constraint, the sword ready to strike;\r\ninvoluntarily, the eyes anticipates the flash of the blade, and the\r\nflesh is feels in advance the rigid incision of the steel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Administrative Control.\r\n\r\n     Changes in the ecclesiastical hierarchy.--Motives for\r\n     subordinating the lesser clergy.--The displacement of\r\n     assistant priests.--Increase of episcopal authority.--Hold\r\n     of Napoleon over the bishops.\r\n\r\nThus is a conquered country treated. He is, in relation to the Church,\r\nas in a conquered country.[5194] Like Westphalia or Holland, she is a\r\nnaturally independent country which he has annexed by treaty, which he\r\nhas been able to include but not absorb in his empire, and which remains\r\ninvincibly distinct. The temporal sovereign, in a spiritual society,\r\nespecially such a sovereign as he is,--nominally Catholic, scarcely\r\nChristian, at best a deist and from time to time as it suits,--will\r\nnever be other than an external suzerain and a foreign prince. To become\r\nand remain master in such an annexed country it is always advisable\r\nto exhibit the sword. Nevertheless, it would not be wise to strike\r\nincessantly; the blade, used too often, would wear out; it is better to\r\nutilize the constitution of the annex, rule over it indirectly, not by\r\nan administrative bureau (régie), but by a protectorate, in which all\r\nindigenous authorities can be employed and be made responsible for the\r\nnecessary rigors. Now, by virtue of the indigenous constitution, the\r\ngovernors of the Catholic annex--all designated beforehand by their\r\nsuitable and indelible character, all tonsured, robed in black,\r\ncelibates and speaking Latin--form two orders, unequal in dignity and\r\nin number; one inferior, comprising myriads of curés and vicars, and the\r\nother superior, comprising some dozens of prelates.\r\n\r\nLet us turn this ready-made hierarchy to account; and, the better to use\r\nit, let us tighten the strings. In agreement with the upper clergy and\r\nthe Pope, we will increase the subjection of the lower clergy; we will\r\ngovern the inferiors through the superiors; whoever has the head has\r\nthe body; it is much easier to handle sixty bishops and archbishops\r\nthan forty thousand vicars and curés; in this particular we need\r\nnot undertake to restore primitive discipline; we must not be either\r\nantiquaries or Gallicans. Let us be careful not to give back to the\r\nsecond-class clergy the independence and stability they enjoyed before\r\n1789, the canonical guarantees which protected them against episcopal\r\ndespotism, the institution of competition, the rights conferred by\r\ntheological grades, the bestowal of the best places on the wisest, the\r\nappeal to the diocesan court in case of disgrace, the opposing plea\r\nbefore the officialité, the permanent tie by which the titular curé,\r\nonce planted in his parish, took root there for life, and believed\r\nhimself bound to his local community like Jesus Christ to the universal\r\nChurch, indissolubly, through a sort of mystic marriage. \"The number of\r\ncurés,\" says Napoleon,[5195] \"must be reduced as much as possible, and\r\nthe number of assistants (desservans) multiplied who can be changed at\r\nwill,\" not only transferable to another parish, but revocable from day\r\nto day, without formalities or delay, without appeal or pleading in any\r\ncourt whatsoever. Henceforth, the sole irremovable curés are the four\r\nthousand; the rest, under the name of succursalists, numbering\r\nthirty thousand,[5196] are ecclesiastical clerks, surrendered to the\r\ndiscretionary power of the bishop. The bishop alone appoints, places and\r\ndisplaces all belonging to his diocese at his pleasure, and with a nod,\r\nhe transfers the most competent from the best to the worst post, from\r\nthe large borough or small town, where he was born and has lived at ease\r\nnear his family, to some wretched parish in this or that village buried\r\nin the woods or lost on a mountain, without income or presbytery; and\r\nstill better, he cuts down his wages, he withdraws the State salary of\r\nfive hundred francs, he turns him out of the lodgings allowed him by\r\nthe commune, on foot on the highway, with no viaticum, even temporary,\r\nexcluded from ecclesiastical ministries, without respect, demeaned, a\r\nvagabond in the great lay world whose ways are unknown to him and whose\r\ncareers are closed to him. Henceforth, and forever, bread is taken out\r\nof his mouth; if he has it to-day, it is lacking on the morrow. Now,\r\nevery three months, the list of succursalists at five hundred francs\r\ndrawn up by the bishop, must be countersigned by the prefect. In his\r\nupper cabinet, near the mantelpiece on which the visiting-cards of\r\nevery considerable personage in the department are displayed, facing the\r\nemperor's bust, the two delegates of the emperor, his two responsible\r\nand judicial managers, the two superintended overseers of the\r\nconscription, confer together on the ecclesiastical staff of the\r\ndepartment. In this as in other matters, they are and feel themselves\r\nkept in check from on high, curbed and forced, willingly or not, to\r\ncome to some agreement. Compulsory collaborators by institution, each\r\nan auxiliary of the other in the maintenance of public order, they\r\nread over article by article the list of appointments of their common\r\nsubordinates; should any name have bad notes, should any succursalist\r\nbe marked as noisy, undesirable, or suspect, should there be any\r\nunfavorable report by the mayor, gendarmerie or upper police, the\r\nprefect, about to sign, lays down his pen, quotes his instructions and\r\ndemands of the bishop against the delinquent some repressive measure,\r\neither destitution, suspension or displacement, removal to an inferior\r\nparish, or, at least, a comminatory reprimand, while the bishop, whom\r\nthe prefect may denounce to the minister, does not refuse to the prefect\r\nthis act of complacency.\r\n\r\nSome months after the publication of the Concordat,[5197] Mademoiselle\r\nChameron, an opera-dancer, dies, and her friends bear her remains to the\r\nchurch of Saint-Roch for internment. They are refused admittance, and\r\nthe curé, very rigid, \"in a fit of ill-humor,\" orders the doors of the\r\nchurch to be shut; a crowd gathers around, shouts and launches threats\r\nat the curé; an actor makes a speech to appease the tumult, and finally\r\nthe coffin is borne off to the church of Les Filles-Saint-Thomas, where\r\nthe assistant priest, \"familiar with the moral of the gospel,\" performs\r\nthe funeral service. Incidents of this kind disturb the tranquility\r\nof the streets and denote a relaxation of administrative discipline.\r\nConsequently the government, doctor in theology and canon law,\r\nintervenes and calls the ecclesiastical superior to account. The first\r\nConsul, in an article in the Moniteur, haughtily gives the clergy their\r\ninstructions and explains the course that will be pursued against them\r\nby his prelates. \"The Archbishop of Paris orders the curé of Saint-Roch\r\ninto retirement for three months, in order that he may bear in mind the\r\ninjunction of Jesus Christ to pray for one's enemies, and, made sensible\r\nof his duties by meditation, may become aware that these superstitious\r\ncustoms..., which degrade religion by their absurdities, have been done\r\naway with by the Concordat and the law of Germinal 18.\" From now on\r\nall priests and curés are prudent, circumspect, obedient, and\r\nreserved,[5198] because their spiritual superiors are so as well,\r\nand could not be otherwise. Each prelate, posted in his diocese, is\r\nmaintained there in isolation; a watch is kept on his correspondence; he\r\nmay communicate with the Pope only through the Minister of Worship;\r\nhe has no right to act in concert with his colleagues; all the general\r\nassemblies of the clergy, all metropolitan councils, all annual synods\r\nare suppressed. The Church of France has ceased to exist as one corps,\r\nwhile its members, carefully detached from each other and from their\r\nRoman head, are no longer united, but juxtaposed. Confined to a\r\ncircumscription, like the prefect, the bishop himself is simply an\r\necclesiastical prefect, a little less uncertain of his tenure of office;\r\nundoubtedly, his removal will not be effected by order, but he can be\r\nforced to send in his resignation. Thus, in his case, as well as for the\r\nprefect, his first care will be not to excite displeasure, and the next\r\none, to please. To stand well at court, with the minister and with the\r\nsovereign, is a positive command, not only on personal grounds, but for\r\nthe sake of Catholic interests. To obtain scholarships for the pupils of\r\nhis seminary,[5199] to appoint the teachers and the director that\r\nsuits him, to insure the acceptance of his canons, cantonal curés, and\r\ncandidates for the priesthood, to exempt his sub-deacons from military\r\nservice, to establish and to defray the expenses of the chapels of his\r\ndiocese, to provide parishes with the indispensable priest, with regular\r\nservices and the sacraments, requires favors, which favors cannot be\r\nenjoyed without an affectation of obedience and zeal and, more important\r\nstill, devotion. Moreover, he is only a human being. If Napoleon has\r\nselected him, it is on account of his intelligence, knowing what he is\r\nabout, open to human motives, not too rigid and of too easy conscience;\r\nin the eyes of the master, the first quality is an obedient personality\r\nattached to his system and person.[51100] Moreover, with his candidates,\r\nhe has always taken into consideration the hold they give him through\r\ntheir weaknesses, vanity and needs, their ostentatious ways and\r\nexpenditure, their love of money, titles and precedence, their ambition,\r\ndesire for promotion, enjoyment of credit, and right of obtaining places\r\nfor protégés and relations. He avails himself of all these advantages\r\nand finds that they answer his purpose. With the exception of three or\r\nfour saints, like Monsignor d'Aviau[51101] or Monsignor Dessolles, who\r\nhe has inadvertently put into the episcopate, the bishops are content to\r\nbe barons, and the archbishops counts. They are glad to rank higher and\r\nhigher in the Legion of Honor; they loudly assert, in praise of the new\r\norder of things, the honors and dignities it confers on these or those\r\nprelates who have become members of the legislative corps or been made\r\nsenators.[51102] Many of them receive secret pay for secret services,\r\npecuniary incentives in the shape of this or that amount in ready money.\r\nIn sum, Napoleon has judged accurately; with hesitation and remorse,\r\nnearly the whole of his episcopal staff, Italian and French, 66 prelates\r\nout of 80, are open to \"temporal influences\". They yield to seductions\r\nand threats; they accept or submit, even in spiritual matters, to his\r\npositive ascendancy.[51103]\r\n\r\nMoreover, among these dignitaries, nearly all of whom are blameless, or,\r\nat least, who behave well and are generally honorable, Napoleon[51104]\r\nfinds a few whose servility is perfect, unscrupulous individuals ready\r\nfor anything that an absolute prince could desire, like Bishops Bernier\r\nand De Pancemont, one accepting a reward of 30,000 francs and the other\r\nthe sum of 50,000 francs[51105] for the vile part they have played in\r\nthe negotiations for the Concordat; a miserly, brutal cynic like Maury,\r\narchbishop of Paris, or an intriguing, mercenary skeptic like De Pradt,\r\narchbishop of Malines; or an old imbecile, falling on his knees before\r\nthe civil power, like Rousseau, bishop of Orleans, who writes a pastoral\r\nletter declaring that the Pope is as free in his Savona prison as on his\r\nthrone at Rome. After 1806,[51106] Napoleon, that he may control men\r\nof greater suppleness, prefers to take his prelates from old noble\r\nfamilies--the frequenters of Versailles, who regard the episcopate as\r\na gift bestowed by the prince and not by the Pope, a lay favor reserved\r\nfor younger sons, a present made by the sovereign to those around his\r\nperson, on the understood condition that the partisan courtier who is\r\npromoted shall remain a courtier of the master. Henceforth nearly\r\nall his episcopal recruits are derived from \"members of the old noble\r\nstock.\" \"Only these,\" says Napoleon, \"know how to serve well.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. The Imperial Catechism\r\n\r\n     Political use of the episcopacy.--The imperial catechism.\r\n     --Pastoral letters.\r\n\r\nFrom the first year the effect arrived at is better than could be\r\nexpected. \"Look at the clergy,\"[51107] said the First Consul to\r\nRoederer; \"every day shows that in spite of themselves their devotion to\r\nthe government is increasing, and much beyond their anticipation. Have\r\nyou seen the pastoral declaration of Boisgelin, archbishop of Tours?...\r\nHe says that the actual government is the legitimate government, that\r\nGod disposes of thrones and kings as he pleases and that he adopts the\r\nchiefs whom the people prefer. Your yourself could not have said that\r\nbetter.\" But notwithstanding that this is said in the pastoral letter,\r\nit is again said in the catechism. No ecclesiastical publication is more\r\nimportant: all Catholic children are to learn this by heart, for the\r\nphrases they recite will be firmly fixed in their memories. Bossuet's\r\ncatechism is good enough, but it may be improved,--there is nothing\r\nthat time, reflection, emulation, and administrative zeal cannot render\r\nperfect! Bossuet teaches children \"to respect all superiors, pastors,\r\nkings, magistrates, and the rest.\" \"But these generalities,\" says\r\nPortalis,[51108] \"no longer suffice. They do not give the proper\r\ntendency to the subject's submission. The object is to center the\r\npopular conscience on the person of Your Majesty.\" Accordingly, let us\r\nbe precise, make appointments and secure support.\r\n\r\nThe imperial catechism, a great deal more explicit than the royal\r\ncatechism, adds significant development to the old one, along with extra\r\nmotives:\r\n\r\n\"We specially owe to our Emperor, Napoleon the First, love, respect,\r\nobedience, fidelity, military service, and tributes ordained for the\r\npreservation of the empire and his throne... For God has raised him up\r\nfor us in times of peril that he might restore public worship and the\r\nholy religion of our fathers and be its protector.\"\r\n\r\nEvery boy and girl in each parish recite this to the vicar or curé after\r\nvespers in their tiny voices as a commandment of God and of the Church,\r\nas a supplementary article of the creed. Meanwhile the officiating\r\npriest in the pulpit gravely comments on this article, already clear\r\nenough, at every morning or evening service;[51109] by order, he\r\npreaches in behalf of the conscription and declares that it is a sin to\r\ntry to escape from it, to be refractory; by order, again, he reads the\r\narmy bulletins giving accounts of the latest victories; always by order,\r\nhe reads the last pastoral letter of his bishop, a document authorized,\r\ninspired and corrected by the police. Not only are the bishops obliged\r\nto submit their pastoral letters and public instructions to the\r\ncensorship; not only by way of precaution, are they forbidden to print\r\nanything except on the prefecture presses, but again, for still greater\r\nsecurity, the bureau of public worship is constantly advising them what\r\nthey must say. First and foremost, they must laud the Emperor. But in\r\nwhat terms, and with what epithets, without indiscretion or mistake, in\r\norder not to meddle with politics, not to appear as a party managed from\r\nabove, not to pass for megaphones, is not explained, and is therefore\r\na difficult matter. \"You must praise the Emperor more in your pastoral\r\nletters,\" said Réal, prefect of police, to a new bishop. \"Tell me in\r\nwhat measure.\" \"I do not know,\" was the reply. Since the measure cannot\r\nbe prescribed, it must be ample enough. There is no difficulty as\r\nregards other articles.--On every occasion the Paris offices take\r\ncare to furnish each bishop with a ready-made draft of his forthcoming\r\npastoral letter--the canvas on which the customary flowers of\r\necclesiastical amplification are to be embroidered. It differs according\r\nto time and place. In La Vendée and in the west, the prelates are to\r\nstigmatize \"the odious machinations of perfidious Albion,\" and explain\r\nto the faithful the persecutions to which the English subject the Irish\r\nCatholics. When Russia is the enemy, the pastoral letter must dwell\r\non her being schismatic; also on the Russian misunderstanding of the\r\nsupremacy of the Pope. Inasmuch as bishops are functionaries of\r\nthe empire, their utterances and their acts belong to the Emperor.\r\nConsequently he makes use of them against all enemies, against each\r\nrival, rebel or adversary, against the Bourbons, against the English and\r\nthe Russians, and, finally, against the Pope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. The Council of 1811.--The Concordat of 1813.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Russian expedition, this is the great and last throw\r\nof the dice, the decisive and most important of his ecclesiastical\r\nundertakings, as the other is in political and military affairs. Just\r\nas, under his leadership, he forces by constraint and, under his lead, a\r\ncoalition of the political and military powers of his Europe against\r\nthe Czar,--Austria, Prussia, the Confederation of the Rhine, Holland,\r\nSwitzerland, the kingdom of Italy, Naples, and even Spain,--so does he\r\nby constraint and under his lead coalesce all the spiritual authorities\r\nof his empire against the Pope. He summons a council, consisting of\r\neighty-four bishops that are available in Italy and in France. He takes\r\nit upon himself to drill them, and he makes them march. To state what\r\ninfluences he uses would require a volume[51110]--theological and\r\ncanonical arguments, appeals to Gallican souvenirs and Jansenist\r\nrancors, eloquence and sophisms, preparatory maneuvers, secret\r\nintrigues, public acting, private solicitations, steady intimidation,\r\nsuccessful pressures, thirteen cardinals exiled and deprived of their\r\ninsignia, two other cardinals confined in Vincennes, nineteen Italian\r\nbishops conveyed to France under escort, without bread or clothes. Fifty\r\npriests of Parma, fifty of Plaisance, besides one hundred other Italian\r\npriests, sent away or confined in Corsica. All congregations\r\nof men in France--Saint-Lazare, Mission, Christian Doctrine,\r\nSaint-Sulpice--dissolved and suppressed. Three bishops of the\r\ncouncil seized in bed at daylight, put into a cell and kept in close\r\nconfinement, forced to resign and to promise in writing not to carry on\r\ncorrespondence with their dioceses; arrest of their adherents in their\r\ndioceses; the Ghent seminarists turned into soldiers, and, with knapsack\r\non their backs, leaving for the army; professors at Ghent, the canons of\r\nTournay, and other Belgian priests shut up in the citadels of Bouillon,\r\nHam and Pierre-Chatel.[51111] Near the end, the council suddenly\r\ndissolved because scruples arise, because it does not yield at once to\r\nthe pressure brought to bear on it, because its mass constitutes its\r\nfirmness, because men standing close together, side by side, stand all\r\nthe longer. \"Our wine in the cask is not good,\" said Cardinal Maury;\r\n\"you will find that it will be better in bottles.\" Accordingly, to make\r\nit ready for bottling, it must be filtered and clarified, so as to get\r\nrid of the bad elements which disturb it and cause fermentation. Many\r\nOpponents are in prison, many have retired from their dioceses, while\r\nthe rest are brought to Paris and cunningly worked upon, each member\r\nin turn, apart and confined, téte-à-téte with the Minister of Worship,\r\nuntil all, one by one, are brought to sign the formula of adhesion.\r\nOn the strength of this, the council, purged and prepared, is summoned\r\nafresh to give its vote sitting or standing, in one unique session;\r\nthrough a remnant of virtue it inserts a suspensive clause in the\r\ndecree, apparently a reservation,[51112] but the decree is passed as\r\nordered. Like the foreign regiment in an army corps which, enlisted,\r\nforced into line, and goaded on with a sharp sword, serves, in spite of\r\nitself, against its legitimate prince, unwilling to march forward to\r\nthe attack, meaning at the last moment to fire in the air, so does it\r\nfinally march and fire its volley notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, on the other hand, treats the Pope in the same fashion, and\r\nwith like skill and brutality. As with the Russian campaign, he has\r\nprepared himself for it long beforehand. At the outset there is an\r\nalliance, and he concedes great advantages to the Pope as to the Czar,\r\nwhich will remain to them after his fall; but these concessions are\r\nmade only with a mental reservation, with the instinctive feeling\r\nand predetermination to profit by the alliance, even to making an\r\nindependent sovereign whom he recognizes as his equal, his subordinate\r\nand a tool; hence, quarrels and war. This time also, in the expedition\r\nagainst the Pope, his strategy is admirable,--the entire ecclesiastical\r\nterritory studied beforehand, the objective point selected,[51113] all\r\ndisposable forces employed and directed by fixed marches to where the\r\nvictory is to be decisive, the conquest extended and the seat of the\r\nfinal dominion established; the successive and simultaneous use of every\r\nkind of means--cunning, violence, seduction and terror. Calculation of\r\nthe weariness, anxiety and despair of the adversary; at first menaces\r\nand constant disputes, and then flashes of lightning and multiplied\r\nclaps of thunder, every species of brutality that force can command;\r\nthe States of the Church invaded in times of peace, Rome surprised and\r\noccupied by soldiers, the Pope besieged in the Quirinal, in a year the\r\nQuirinal taken by a nocturnal assault, the Pope seized and carried off\r\nby post to Savona and there confined as a prisoner of state almost in\r\ncellular seclusion,[51114] subject to the entreaties and manoeuvres of\r\nan adroit prefect who works upon him, of the physician who is a paid\r\nspy, of the servile bishops who are sent thither, alone with his\r\ncon-science, contending with inquisitors relieving each other, subject\r\nto moral tortures as subtile and as keen as old-time physical tortures,\r\nto tortures so steady and persistent that he sinks, loses his head, \"no\r\nlonger sleeps and scarcely speaks,\" falling into a senile condition and\r\neven more than senile condition, \"a state of mental alienation.\"[51115]\r\nThen, on issuing from this, the poor old man is again beset; finally,\r\nafter waiting patiently for three years, he is once more brusquely\r\nconducted at night, secretly and incognito, over the entire road, with\r\nno repose or pity though ill, except stopping once in a snow-storm at\r\nthe hospice on Mount Cenis, where he comes near dying; put back after\r\ntwenty-four hours in his carriage, bent double by suffering and in\r\nconstant pain; jolting over the pavement of the grand highway until\r\nalmost dead and landed at Fontainebleau, where Napoleon wishes to have\r\nhim ready at hand to work upon. \"Indeed,\" he himself says, \"he is\r\na lamb, an excellent, worthy man whom I esteem and am very fond\r\nof.\"[51116]\r\n\r\nAn improvised tête-a-tête may probably prove effective with this gentle,\r\ncandid and tender spirit. Pius VII., who had never known ill-will,\r\nmight be won by kindly treatment, by an air of filial respect, by\r\ncaresses; he may feel the personal ascendency of Napoleon, the\r\nprestige of his presence and conversation, the invasion of his genius.\r\nInexhaustible in arguments, matchless in the adaptation of ideas to\r\ncircumstances, the most amiable and most imperious of interlocutors,\r\nstentorian and mild, tragic and comic by turns, the most eloquent of\r\nsophists and the most irresistible of fascinators, as soon as he meets\r\na man face to face, he wins him, conquers him, and obtains the\r\nmastery.[51117] In effect, after seeing the Pope for six days, Napoleon\r\nobtains by persuasion what he could not obtain afar by constraint. Pius\r\nVII. signs the new Concordat in good faith, himself unaware that, on\r\nregaining his freedom and surrounded by his cardinals, who inform him\r\non the political situation, he will emerge from his bewilderment, be\r\nattacked by his conscience, and, through his office, publicly accuse\r\nhimself, humbly repent, and in two months withdraw his signature.\r\n\r\nSuch, after 1812 and 1813, is the duration of Napoleon's triumphs\r\nand the ephemeral result of his greatest military and ecclesiastical\r\nachievements--Moskow, Lutzen, Bautzen and Dresden, the Council of 1811\r\nand the Concordat of 1813. Whatever the vastness of his genius may be,\r\nhowever strong his will, however successful his attacks, his success\r\nagainst nations and churches never is, and never can be, other than\r\ntemporary. Great historical and moral forces elude his grasp. In vain\r\ndoes he strike, for their downfall gives them new life, and they rise\r\nbeneath the blow. With Catholic institutions,[51118] as with other\r\npowers, not only do his efforts remain sterile, but what he accomplishes\r\nremains inverse to the end he has in view. He aims to subjugate the\r\nPope, and he led the Pope on to omnipotence He aims at the maintenance\r\nand strength of the Gallican spirit among the French clergy, and yet\r\nbrings them under the rule of the ultramontane spirit.[51119] With\r\nextraordinary energy and tenacity, with all his power, which was\r\nenormous, through the systematic and constant application of diverse and\r\nextreme measures, he labored for fifteen years to rend the ties of the\r\nCatholic hierarchy, take it to pieces, and, in sum, the final result of\r\nall is to tie them faster and hasten its completion.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5101: Se preface to \"The Modern Régime,\" Vol. I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5102: On some of the ideas above indicated see \"The Modern\r\nRégime,\" Vol. I. p.120.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5103: An allusion to Malthusianism, practiced by many heads\r\nof families in France.

THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Catholic System.\r\n\r\n     The effects of the system.--Completion of the ecclesiastical\r\n     hierarchy.--Omnipotence of the Pope in the Church.\r\n     --Influence of the French Concordat and other precedents from\r\n     1801 to 1870.--Why the clergy becomes ultramontane.--The\r\n     dogma of Infallibility.\r\n\r\nIn 1801, at Rome, pending the negotiations for the Concordat, when Pius\r\nVII. still hesitated about the deposition in mass of the survivors of\r\nthe ancient French episcopacy, clear-sighted observers already remarked,\r\n\"Let this Concordat which the First Consul desires be completed,[5201]\r\nand you will see, on its ratification, its immense importance and\r\nthe power it will give to Rome over the episcopacy throughout the\r\nuniverse.\"--In effect, through this \"extraordinary, nearly unexampled\"\r\nact of authority, and certainly unequaled \"in the history of the\r\nChurch,\"[5202] the ultramontane theory, contested up to this time,\r\nmaintained in the speculative region of abstract formulae, comes down\r\nto solid ground, into practical and lasting use. Willingly or not, \"the\r\nPope acts as if universal bishop;\" urged and constrained by the lay\r\npower, attached to a dictatorship,[5203] he entered upon it and so\r\ninstalled himself, and, ten years later, Napoleon, who had impelled him\r\non, regretted that he had done so. Warned by his Gallican jurists,\r\nhe saw the ecclesiastical import of his work; but it was too late to\r\nretreat--the decisive step had been taken.--For, in fact, the Pope had\r\ndeprived all the chieftains of a great church of their thrones, \"his\r\ncolleagues and co-bishops,\"[5204] successors of the apostles under the\r\nsame title as himself, members \"of the same order and stamped \"with the\r\nsame \"character,\" eighty-five legitimate incumbents[5205] and, still\r\nbetter, as admitted by himself, blameless, worthy, persecuted\r\nbecause they had obeyed him, banished from France on account of their\r\nunwillingness to quit the Roman Church. He had ordered them to resign;\r\nhe had withdrawn apostolic powers from the thirteen who had refused to\r\ntender their resignations; to all, even to those who refused, he had\r\nappointed their successors. He assigned to the new titularies dioceses\r\nof a new pattern and, to justify novelties of such gravity,[5206] he\r\ncould allege no other reasons than circumstances, the exigencies of\r\nlay power, and the welfare of the Church. After that the Gallicans\r\nthemselves, unless accepting the risk of a schism and of separating\r\nforever from the Holy See, were obliged to allow the Pope above and\r\nbeyond the ordinary powers exercised by him within the old limits of\r\ncanons and of custom, an extraordinary power unlimited by any canon or\r\nby any custom,[5207] a plenary and absolute authority, a right above\r\nall other rights, by virtue of which, in cases determined by himself, he\r\nprovided in a discretionary way for all Catholic interests, of which he\r\nthus becomes the supreme judge, the sole interpreter and the court of\r\nlast appeal. An indestructible precedent was set up; it was the great\r\ncorner-stone in the support of the modern Church edifice; on this\r\ndefinitive foundation all other stones were to be superposed, one by\r\none. In 1801, Pius VII., under the pressure of the reigning Napoleon,\r\nhad obliged the prelates of the old régime, sullied by a monarchical\r\norigin and suspected of zeal for the dethroned Bourbons, to abandon\r\ntheir seats. In 1816, under the pressure of the re-established Bourbons,\r\nthe same Pius VII. obliged Fesch, cardinal-archbishop of Lyons, and\r\nuncle of the fallen Napoleon, to abandon his seat. Bercastel et Henrion,\r\nXIII, 192. Cardinal Fesch having been banished from France by the law\r\nof January 12, 1816, \"the Pope no longer regarded the person of the\r\ncardinal, but the diocese that had to be saved at any cost, by virtue of\r\nthe principle salus populi suprema lex. Consequently, he prohibited the\r\ncardinal from \"exercising episcopal jurisdiction in his metropolitan\r\nchurch, and constituted M. de Bernis administrator of that church,\r\nspiritually as well as temporally, notwithstanding all constitutions\r\ndecreed even by the general councils, the apostolic ordinances,\r\nprivileges, etc.\" In both cases the situation was similar, and, in the\r\nlatter as in the former case, motives of the same order warranted the\r\nsame use of the same power.\r\n\r\nBut the situation, in being prolonged, multiplied, for the Church, the\r\nnumber of urgent cases, and, for the sovereign pontiff the number of\r\ncases of intervention. Since 1789, the entire civil order of things,\r\nconstitutional, political, social and territorial, had become singularly\r\nunstable, not only in France but in Europe, not only on the old\r\ncontinent but likewise on the new one. Sovereign states by hundreds\r\nsunk under the strokes and counter-strokes, indefinitely propagated and\r\nenforced by the philosophy of the eighteenth century and of the French\r\nRevolution; others, by dozens, arose in their place, and, in these,\r\ndifferent dynasties succeeded each other; here, Catholic populations\r\nfalling under the rule of a schismatic or Protestant prince; there, this\r\nor that Catholic country, for fifteen years included in a mixed state,\r\ndetached from it and constituted apart. In Protestant America, the\r\nCatholics, increased to millions, formed new communities in Catholic\r\nAmerica, the colonies had become independent; almost everywhere in\r\nAmerica and in Europe the maxims of government and of public opinion\r\nhad changed. Now, after each of these changes, some initiative,\r\nsome direction, some authority was necessary, in order to reconcile\r\necclesiastical with lay institutions; the Pope was on hand, and on each\r\noccasion he establishes this concord.[5208] At one time, by a diplomatic\r\nact analogous to the French Concordat of 1801, he negotiates with the\r\nsovereign of the country--Bavaria, Wurtemburg, Prussia, Austria, Spain,\r\nPortugal, the two Sicilies, the Netherlands, Belgium and Russia. Again,\r\nowing to the tolerant liberalism, or to the Constitutional indifference\r\nof the lay government, he alone prescribes, notably in Holland, in\r\nIreland, in England, in Canada, and in the United States, a division\r\nof the country into ecclesiastical districts, the erection of new\r\nbishoprics, and the lasting regulation of the hierarchy, the discipline,\r\nthe means of support and the recruiting of the clergy. Again, when\r\nsovereignty is in dispute, as after the emancipation of the Spanish\r\ncolonies, he does without it, in spite of the opposition of the\r\nmother-country, and, \"without putting himself in relation with the new\r\ngovernments,[5209] he, acting for himself, \"that he may put an end\r\nto the widowhood of the Churches,\" appoints bishops, assigns them a\r\nprovisional régime in anticipation of the epoch when, in concert with\r\nbetter founded governments, he will decree their definitive régime. In\r\nthis way, all the great existing churches of the Catholic universe are\r\nthe work of the Pope, his latest work, his own creation attested by a\r\npositive act of contiguous date, and of which the souvenir is vivid:\r\nhe has not recognized them--he has made them; he has given them their\r\nexternal form and their internal structure; no one of them can look\r\nwithin itself without finding in its laws the fresh imprint of the\r\nsovereign hand which has fashioned it; none of them can assert or even\r\nbelieve itself legitimate without declaring the superior authority to be\r\nlegitimate which has just endowed it with life and being. The last\r\nstep, the greatest of all, above the terrestrial and practical order of\r\nthings, in speculative theology, in the revelation of the supernatural,\r\nin the definition of things that are divine: the Pope, the better to\r\nprove his autocracy, in 1854, decrees, solely, of his own accord, a new\r\ndogma, the immaculate conception of the Virgin, and he is careful to\r\nnote that he does it without the concurrence of the bishops; they were\r\non hand, but they neither deliberated nor decided.[5210]\r\n\r\nThus arise durable powers, spiritual or temporal, little by little,\r\nthrough the uninterrupted and uncontested series of their acts; from\r\n1791 to 1870 all ecclesiastical precedents, one added to another, became\r\nconsolidated, one through the other and through their mass; story after\r\nstory, steadily ascending and converging to raise the Pope higher still,\r\nuntil at last, on the summit of the edifice, the Holy See becomes\r\nthe keystone of the arch, the omnipotence of fact being completed by\r\nomnipotence of right.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Catholic opinion came to the aid of pontifical opinion, and,\r\nin France, the clergy spontaneously became ultramontane because there\r\nwas no longer any motive for remaining Gallican. Since the Revolution,\r\nthe Concordat and the Organic Articles, all the sources which maintained\r\nin it a national as well as particularist spirit, had dried up; in\r\nceased being a distinct, proprietary and favored body; its members are\r\nno longer leagued together by the community of a temporal interest,\r\nby the need of defending their privileges, by the faculty of acting\r\nin concert, by the right of holding periodical assemblies; they are no\r\nlonger, as formerly, attached to the civil power by great social and\r\nlegal advantages, by their honorable priority in lay society, by their\r\nimmunities from taxation, by the presence and influence of their bishops\r\nin the provincial parliaments, by the noble origin and magnificent\r\nendowments of nearly all their prelates, by the repressive support which\r\nthe secular arm lent to the church against dissenters and free-thinkers,\r\nby the immemorial legislation and customs which, erecting Catholicism\r\ninto a State religion, imposed the Catholic faith on the monarch, not\r\nalone in his quality of a private individual and to fix his personal\r\nbelief, but again in his quality of public magistrate, to influence his\r\npolicy and to share in his government. This last article is capital,\r\nand out of its abrogation the rest follows: at this turn of the road\r\nthe French clergy is thrown off the Gallican track, every step it\r\ntakes after this being on the way to Rome. For, according to Catholic\r\ndoctrine, outside of the Roman Church there is no salvation; to enter\r\nit, to rest in it, to be led by it is the highest interest and first\r\nduty of man; it is the unique and infallible guide; all acts that it\r\ncondemns are culpable, and not only private acts, but likewise all\r\npublic acts; the sovereign who commits them may, as an individual, be\r\nCatholic by profession and even loyal at heart; but, as a ruler, he is\r\ndisloyal, he has lost his semi-ecclesiastic character, he has ceased to\r\nbe \"the exterior bishop,\" he is not worthy to command a clerical body.\r\nHenceforth, the Christian conscience no longer bows down before him\r\nwith love and respect; nothing remains to him for support but social\r\nprudence; and again is it with resignation, because the Church commands\r\nobedience to the authorities, and the same Church commands disobedience\r\nto these authorities when, abusing their power, they encroach on its\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nNow, ten years ago, the State had done nothing else, and, to the old\r\nConcordat which was not good, it had just substituted a Concordat that\r\nwas worse. This new alliance, concluded by it with the Church in 1802,\r\nis not a religious marriage, the solemn sacrament by which, at Rheims,\r\nshe and the King promised to live together and in harmony in the same\r\nfaith, but a simple civil contract, more precisely the legal regulation\r\nof a lasting and deliberate divorce.--In a paroxysm of despotism the\r\nState has stripped the Church of its possessions and turned it out of\r\ndoors, without clothes or bread, to beg on the highways; next, in a fit\r\nof rage, its aim was to kill it outright, and it did partially strangle\r\nit. Recovering its reason, but having ceased to be Catholic, it has\r\nforced the signature of a pact which is repugnant, and which reduces\r\ntheir moral union to physical cohabitation. Willingly or not, the\r\ntwo contracting parties are to continue living together in the same\r\ndomicile, since that is the only one they possess; but, as there is\r\nincompatibility of humor, they will do well to live apart. To this end,\r\nthe State assigns a small, distinct lodging to the Church and allows her\r\na meager supply of food; this done, it fancies that it may cry quits;\r\nand, worse still, it imagines that she is always its subject, and still\r\npretends to the same authority over her; the State is determined to\r\nretain all rights conferred upon it by the old marriage, and these\r\nrights it exercises and adds to. Meanwhile, it admits into the same\r\nlodging three other Churches which it subjects to the same régime: that\r\nmakes four mess-rooms to be maintained and which it watches, supports\r\nand utilizes the best it can for the temporal advantage of the\r\nhousehold. There is nothing more odious to the Catholic Church than this\r\nadvertised, practical polygamy, this subvention granted indifferently\r\nto all cults, this patronage in common, more insulting than abandonment,\r\nthis equal treatment[5211] which places the pulpit of truth and the\r\npulpits of falsehood, the ministry of salvation and the ministries\r\nof perdition, on the same footing. Nothing is more serviceable for\r\nalienating a Catholic clergy, for making it consider civil power as\r\nforeign, usurping, or even inimical, for detaching the Gallican Church\r\nfrom its French center, for driving it back towards its Roman center and\r\nfor handing it over to the Pope.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, the latter is the unique center, the sole surviving head\r\nof the Church, inseparable from it because he is naturally its head and\r\nbecause it is naturally his body; and all the more because this mutual\r\ntie has been strengthened by trials. Head and body have been struck\r\ntogether, by the same hands, and each on the other's account. The Pope\r\nhas suffered like the Church, along with and for it. Pius VI., dethroned\r\nand borne off by the Directory, died in prison at Valence; Pius VII.,\r\ndethroned and carried off by Napoleon, is confined, sequestered and\r\noutraged for four years in France, while all generous hearts take sides\r\nwith the oppressed against his oppressors. Moreover, his dispossession\r\nadds to his prestige: it can no longer be claimed that territorial\r\ninterests prevail with him over Catholic interests; therefore, according\r\nas his temporal power diminishes his spiritual power expands, to such an\r\nextent that, in the end, after three-quarters of a century, just at the\r\nmoment when the former is to fall to the ground the latter is to rise\r\nabove the clouds; through the effacement of his human character his\r\nsuperhuman character becomes declared; the more the sovereign prince\r\ndisappears, the more does the sovereign pontiff assert himself. The\r\nclergy, despoiled like him of its hereditary patrimony and confined like\r\nhim to its sacerdotal office, exposed to the same dangers, menaced by\r\nthe same enemies, rallies around him the same as an army around its\r\ngeneral; inferiors and superiors, they are all priests alike and are\r\nnothing else, with a clearer and clearer conscience of the solidarity\r\nwhich binds them together and subordinates the inferiors to the\r\nsuperiors. From one ecclesiastical generation to another,[5212] the\r\nnumber of the refractory, of the intractable and of independents,\r\nrigorists or the lax, goes on decreasing, some, conscientious\r\nJansenists, hardened and sectarians of the \"Little Church,\" others,\r\nsemi-philosophers, tolerant and liberal, both inheriting too narrow\r\nconvictions or too broad opinions for maintaining themselves and\r\nspreading in the newly founded society (milieu).[5213] They die out,\r\none by one, while their doctrines fall into discredit and then into\r\noblivion. A new spirit animates the new clergy, and, after 1808,\r\nNapoleon remarks of it, \"It does not complain of the old one, and is\r\neven satisfied with it; but, he says, they are bringing up new priests\r\nin a sombre fanatical doctrine: there is nothing Gallican in the\r\nyouthful clergy,\"[5214] no sympathy for the civil power. After Napoleon,\r\nand on getting out of his terrible hands, the Catholics have good\r\nreasons for their repugnance to his theology; it has put too many\r\nCatholics in jail, the most eminent in rank, in holiness, bishops and\r\ncardinals, including the Pope. Gallican maxims are dishonored by the use\r\nNapoleon has made of them. Canon law, in public instruction and in\r\nthe seminaries (of the Catholics), ends insensibly in unlooked-for\r\nconclusions; texts and arguments opposed to the Pope's authority seem\r\nweaker and weaker; texts and arguments favorable to the Pope's authority\r\nseem stronger and stronger;[5215] the doctors most deferred to are\r\nno longer Gerson and Bossuet, but Bellarmin and Suarez; flaws are\r\ndiscovered in the decrees of the council of Constance; the Declaration\r\nof the clergy of France in 1682 is found to contain errors condemned\r\nand open to condemnation.[5216] After 1819, M. de Maistre, a powerful\r\nlogician, matchless herald and superb champion, in his book on \"The\r\nPope,\" justifies, prepares and announces the coming constitution of\r\nthe Church.--Step by step, the assent of Catholic community is won or\r\nmastered;[5217] on approaching 1870, it is nearly universal; after 1870,\r\nit is wholly so and could not be otherwise; whoever refuses to submit is\r\nexcluded from the community and excludes himself from it, for he denies\r\na dogma which it professes, a revealed dogma, an article of faith which\r\nthe Pope and the council have just decreed. Thenceforward, the Pope,\r\nin his magisterial pulpit, in the eyes of every man who is and wants to\r\nremain Catholic, is infallible; when he gives his decision on faith or\r\non morals, Jesus Christ himself speaks by his mouth, and his definitions\r\nof doctrine are \"irrefutable,\" \"they are so of themselves, they\r\nalone, through their own virtue, and not by virtue of the Church's\r\nconsent.\"[5218] For the same reason, his authority is absolute, not only\r\nin matters which concern faith and morals, but again in matters which\r\nconcern the discipline and government of the Church.\"[5219] His judgment\r\nmay be resorted to in every ecclesiastical case; nobody is allowed\r\nto question his verdict; \"nobody is allowed to appeal to the future\r\noecumenical council;\"[5220] He has not only \"a priority by right,\r\nan office of inspection and of direction; he holds again priority\r\nof jurisdiction, a full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the\r\nuniversal Church,... \", \"the total plenitude of this supreme power,\" not\r\nindirectly and extraordinarily, but \"directly and ordinarily, over all\r\nchurches and over each one of them, over all pastors and all believers,\r\nover each believer and each of the pastors.\"--Read this in the Latin:\r\neach word, through its ancient root and through its historic vegetation,\r\ncontributes to strengthening the despotic and Roman sense of the text;\r\nthe language of the people which invented and practiced dictatorship had\r\nto be employed for the affirmation of dictatorship with that precision\r\nand that copiousness, with that excess of energy and of conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Bishops and their new Situation.\r\n\r\n     The bishop in his diocese.--Change of situation and rôle.\r\n     --Depreciation of other local authorities.--Diminution of\r\n     other ecclesiastical authorities.--Decline of the chapter\r\n     and the jurisdiction.--The bishop alone dispenses rigors and\r\n     favors.--Use of displacement.--Second-class clergy subject\r\n     to military discipline.--Why it submits to this.\r\n\r\nThe change brought about in the condition and role of the bishop was\r\nnot less grave. Along with the court noblesse and great ecclesiastical\r\nproperty, we see the prelate of the old régime disappearing by degrees,\r\nthe younger son of a noble family, promoted by favor and very young,\r\nendowed with a large income and much more a man of the world than of\r\nthe Church. In 1789, out of 134 bishops or archbishops, only 5 were of\r\nplebeian origin; in 1889, out of 90 bishops or archbishops there are\r\nonly 4 of them nobles;[5221] previous to the Revolution, the titular of\r\nan Episcopal see enjoyed, on the average, a revenue of 100,000 francs;\r\nat the present day, he receives only a salary of from 10,000 to 15,000\r\nfrancs.[5222] In place of the grand seignior, an amiable and magnificent\r\nhost, given to display and to entertaining the best company, keeping\r\nan open table in his diocese when he happens to be there, but generally\r\nabsent, an habitué of Paris or a courtier at Versailles, we see another\r\nstepping forward to take his seat He is bearing the same title, is\r\na personage whose habits and origins are different, a resident\r\nadministrator, much less ornamental but much more active and governing,\r\nprovided with a more ample jurisdiction, with more absolute authority\r\nand wielding more effective influence. The final effect of the\r\nRevolution in relation to the bishop is the same as in relation to the\r\nPope, and in the French diocese, as in the universal Church, the modern\r\nrégime sets up a central, extraordinary, enormous power of which the\r\nancient regime knew nothing.\r\n\r\nFormerly, the bishop encountered around him, on the spot, equals and\r\nrivals, bodies of men or individuals, as independent and powerful as\r\nhimself, irremovable, owners of estates, dispensers of offices and of\r\nfavors, local authorities by legal sanction, permanent patrons of a\r\npermanent class of dependents. In his own cathedral, his metropolitan\r\nchapter was, like himself, a collator of benefice; elsewhere, other\r\nchapters were so likewise and knew how to maintain their rights against\r\nhis supremacy. In each body of regular clergy, every grand abbot or\r\nprior, every noble abbess was, like himself, a sort of sovereign prince.\r\nThe territorial seignior and justiciary on his own domain, was through\r\nthe partial survival of the old wholly secular feudal order equally\r\nsovereign. Likewise sovereign, was, for its part, the parliament of\r\nthe province, with its rights of registry and of remonstrance, with\r\nits administrative attributes and interference, with its train of loyal\r\nauxiliaries and subordinates, from the judges of the presidencies and\r\nbailiwicks down to the corporations of advocates, prosecutors and other\r\nmembers of the bar.[5223] The parliamentarians of the district capital\r\n(chef-lieu), purchasers and owners of their offices, magistrates from\r\nfather to son, much wealthier and much prouder than nowadays, were,\r\nin their old hereditary mansions, the real chiefs of the province, its\r\nconstant representatives on the spot, its popular defenders against\r\nministerial and royal absolutism. All these powers, which once\r\ncounterbalanced episcopal power, have disappeared. Restricted to their\r\njudicial office, the tribunals have ceased to be political authorities\r\nand moderators of the central government: in the town and department,\r\nthe mayor and general councilors, appointed or elected for a certain\r\ntime, enjoy only temporary credit; the prefect, the military commandant,\r\nthe rector, the treasurer-general are merely passing strangers.\r\nThe local circumscription, for a century, is an exterior post where\r\nindividuals live together in contact but not associated; no longer\r\ndoes any intimate, lasting and strong bond exist between them; nothing\r\nremains of the old province but a population of inhabitants, a given\r\nnumber of private persons under unstable functionaries. The bishop\r\nalone has maintained himself intact and erect, a dignitary for life, the\r\nconductor, by title and in fact, of a good many persons, the stationary\r\nand patient undertaker of a great service, the unique general and\r\nundisputed commander of a special militia which, through conscience and\r\nprofessions, gathers close around him and, every morning, awaits his\r\norders. Because in his essence, he is a governor of souls. Revolution\r\nand centralization have not encroached on his ecclesiastical\r\nprerogative. Thanks to this indelible quality he has been able to endure\r\nthe suppression of the others; these have come back to him of themselves\r\nand with others added, comprising local superiority, real importance and\r\nlocal ascendancy; including the various honorable appellations which,\r\nunder the ancient régime, denoted his rank and preeminence; at the\r\npresent day, under the modern régime, they are no longer in use for a\r\nlayman and even for a minister of state; after 1802, one of the articles\r\nof the Organic Laws,[5224] interdicts them to bishops and archbishops;\r\nthey are \"allowed to add to their name only the title of citizen and\r\nmonsieur.\" But practically, except in the official almanac, everybody\r\naddresses a prelate as \"my lord,\" and in the clergy, among believers,\r\nin writing or in speaking to him, he is called \"your Grace,\" under the\r\nrepublic as under the monarchy.\r\n\r\nThus, in this provincial soil where other powers have lost their roots,\r\nnot only has he kept his, but he has extended them and much farther; he\r\nhas grown beyond all measure and now the whole ecclesiastical territory\r\nbelongs to him. Formerly, on this territory, many portions of it, and\r\nquite large ones, were enclosures set apart, reserves that an immemorial\r\nwall prevented him from entering. It was not he who, in a great majority\r\nof cases, conferred livings and offices; it was not he who, in more than\r\none-half of them, appointed to vacant curacies. At Besançon,[5225] among\r\n1500 benefices and livings, he once conferred less than 100 of them,\r\nwhile his metropolitan chapter appointed as many curés as himself; at\r\nArras, he appointed only 47 curés and his chapter 66; at Saint-Omer,\r\namong the collators of curacies he ranked only third, after the abbey\r\nof Saint-Martin and after the chapter of the cathedral. At Troyes, he\r\ncould dispose only of 197 curacies out of 372; at Boulogne, out of 180,\r\nhe had only 80, and this again because the chapter voluntarily abandoned\r\nto him 16. Naturally, the eyes of all candidates turned towards the\r\ncollator; and, among the highest and most lucrative places, those\r\nwhich gave the least trouble and afforded the most satisfaction,\r\nall sinecures, ranks, simple benefices and large urban curacies,\r\nprobendaries and canonicates, most of the offices, titles, and incomes\r\nthat might tempt human ambition, were in the hands, not of the bishop,\r\nbut of the king or of the Pope, of an abbot or prior, of an abbess,\r\nor of a certain university,[5226] of this or that cathedral or\r\ncollege-body, of a lay seignior, of a patentee, or of an indultaire,\r\nand often of the titulary himself. Thus, the hold of the bishop on his\r\nclercs was feeble; he did not hold them through the hope of a favor.\r\nAnd, on the other hand, he had still less hold on them, no hold at\r\nall, through fear of losing favor. They might displease him almost with\r\nimpunity; his faculty for punishment was much more restricted than his\r\nmeans of recompense. His subordinates could find shelter and refuge\r\nagainst his displeasure, and even against his hostility. In the first\r\nplace, and as a principle, a titulary, whether ecclesiastic or secular,\r\nowned his office and hence was irremovable; they themselves, plain\r\nvicar-curates, the humble desservans[5227] of a rural parish, had\r\nacquired this privilege through the declarations of 1726 and 1731.[5228]\r\nMoreover, in case of interdiction, suspension or of censure, a titulary\r\ncould always recur to the courts against episcopal judgment and any\r\nother, against all encroachment on spiritual or temporal prerogatives,\r\nor on those which were useful or honorary belonging to his charge.\r\n\r\nThese courts were of two kinds, one ecclesiastical and the other\r\nsecular, and in each an appeal could be made from a lower to a higher\r\ncourt, from the diocesan official to the metropolitan official, and from\r\nthe présidial to the parliament, with a complete judicial staff,\r\njudge, assessors, public ministry, prosecutors, advocates and clerks,\r\nrestricted to the observing of all judicial formalities, authentic\r\npapers, citations of witnesses and challenges of testimony,\r\ninterrogatories and pleadings, allegation of canons, laws and\r\nprecedents, presence of the defendant, opposing arguments, delays\r\nin procedure, publicity and scandal. Before the slow march and\r\ninconveniences of such a trial, the bishop often avoided giving\r\njudgment, and all the more because his verdicts, even when confirmed by\r\nthe ecclesiastical court, might be warded off or rendered ineffective\r\nby the lay tribunal; for, from the former to the latter, there was\r\nan appeal under writ of error, and the latter, a jealous rival of the\r\nformer, was ill-disposed towards the sacerdotal authorities;[5229]\r\nbesides, in the latter case, far more than in the former, the bishop\r\nfound confronting him not merely the more or less legal right of his own\r\nparty, but again the allies and patrons of his party, corporations and\r\nindividuals who, according to an accepted usage, interfered through\r\ntheir solicitations with the judges and openly placed their credit at\r\nthe service of their protégé. With so many spokes in the wheels, the\r\nworking of an administrative machine was difficult; to give it effective\r\nmotion, it required the steady pressure, the constant starting, the\r\nwatchful and persistent efforts of a laborious, energetic, and callous\r\nhand, while, under the ancient régime, the delicate white hands of a\r\ngentleman-prelate were ill-adapted to this rude business; they were\r\ntoo nicely washed, too soft. To manage personally and on the spot a\r\nprovincial, complicated and rusty machine, always creaking and groaning,\r\nto give one's self up to it, to urge and adjust twenty local wheels, to\r\nput up with knocks and splashes, to become a business man, that is to\r\nsay a hard worker--nothing was less desirable for a grand seignior of\r\nthat epoch. In the Church as in the State, he made the most of his rank;\r\nhe collected and enjoyed its fruits, that is to say money, honors and\r\ngratifications, and, among these gratifications, the principal one,\r\nleisure; hence, he abandoned every special duty, the daily manipulation\r\nof men and things, the practical direction, all effective government, to\r\nhis ecclesiastical or lay intendants, to subordinates whom he scarcely\r\nlooked after and who, at his own house, on his own domain, replaced\r\nhim as fixed residents. The bishop, in his own diocese, left the\r\nadministration in the hands of his canons and grand-vicars; \"the\r\nofficial decided without his meddling.\"[5230] The machine thus worked\r\nalone and by itself, with very few shocks, in the old rut established by\r\nroutine; he helped it along only by the influence he exercised at Paris\r\nand Versailles, by recommendations to the ministers in reality, he\r\nwas merely the remote and worldly representative of his ecclesiastical\r\nprincipality at court and in the drawing-room.[5231] When, from time\r\nto time, he made his appearance there, the bells were rung; deputations\r\nfrom all bodies hurried to his antechambers; each authority in turn, and\r\naccording to the order of precedence, paid him its little compliment,\r\nwhich compliment he graciously returned and then, the homage being over,\r\nhe distributed among them benedictions and smiles. After this, with\r\nequal dignity and still more graciously throughout his sojourn, he\r\ninvited the most eligible to his table and, in his episcopal palace\r\nor in his country-house, he treated them as guests. This done, he had\r\nperformed his duty; the rest was left to his secretaries, ecclesiastical\r\nofficials and clerks, men of the bureaux, specialists and \"plodders.\"\r\n\"Did you read my pastoral letter?\" said a bishop to Piron. And Piron,\r\nwho was very outspoken, dared reply, \"Yes, my lord. And yourself?\"\r\n\r\nUnder the modern régime, this suzerain for show, negligent and\r\nintermittent, is succeeded by an active sovereign whose reign is\r\npersonal and constant; the limited and easy monarchy of the diocese is\r\nconverted into an universal and absolute monarchy. When the bishop,\r\nonce invested and consecrated, enters the choir of his cathedral to the\r\nreverberations of the organ, lighted with wax candles amidst clouds of\r\nincense, and seats himself in solemn pomp[5232] \"on his throne,\" he is\r\na prince who takes possession of his government, which possession is\r\nnot nominal or partial, but real and complete. He holds in his hand \"the\r\nsplendid cross which the priests of his diocese have presented to him,\"\r\nin witness of and symbolizing their voluntary, eager and full\r\nobedience; and this pastoral baton is larger than the old one. In the\r\necclesiastical herd, no head browses at a distance or under cover; high\r\nor low, all are within reach, all eyes are turned towards the episcopal\r\ncrook; at a sign made by the crook, and according to the signal, each\r\nhead forthwith stands, advances or recedes: it knows too well that the\r\nshepherd's hands are free and that it is subject to its will. Napoleon,\r\nin his reconstruction of the diocese, made additions to only one of the\r\ndiocesan powers, that of the bishop; he suffered the others to remain\r\nlow down, on the ground. The delays, complications and frictions of a\r\ndivided government were repugnant to him; he had no taste for and\r\nno comprehension of any but a concentrated government; he found it\r\nconvenient to deal with but one man, a prefect of the spiritual order,\r\nas pliable as his colleague of the temporal order, a mitered grand\r\nfunctionary--such was the bishop in his eyes. This is the reason why\r\nhe did not oblige him to surround himself with constitutional and\r\nmoderating authorities; he did not restore the ancient bishop's court\r\nand the ancient chapter; he allowed his prelates themselves to pen the\r\nnew diocesan statute.--Naturally, in the division of powers, the bishop\r\nreserved the best part to himself, the entire substance, and, to limit\r\nhis local omnipotence, there remained simply lay authority. But, in\r\npractice, the shackles by which the civil government kept him in its\r\ndependence, broke or became relaxed one by one. Among the Organic\r\nArticles, almost all of them which subjected or repressed the bishop\r\nfell into discredit or into desuetude. Meanwhile, those which authorized\r\nand exalted the bishop remained in vigor and maintained their effect.\r\nConsequently, Napoleon's calculation, in relation to the bishop or in\r\nrelation to the Pope, proved erroneous. He wanted to unite in one person\r\ntwo incompatible characters, to convert the dignitaries of the Church\r\ninto dignitaries of the State, to make functionaries out of potentates.\r\nThe functionary insensibly disappeared; the potentate alone subsisted\r\nand still subsists.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, conformably to the statute of 1802, the cathedral\r\nchapter,[5233] except in case of one interim, is a lifeless and\r\nstill-born body, a vain simulachre; it is always, by title or on paper,\r\nthe Catholic \"senate,\" the bishop's obligatory \"council\";[5234] but he\r\ntakes his councillors where he pleases, outside of the chapter, if that\r\nsuits him, and he is free not to take any of them, \"to govern alone, to\r\ndo all himself.\" It is he who appoints to all offices, to the five or\r\nsix hundred offices of his diocese; he is the universal collator of\r\nthese and, nine times out of ten, the sole collator; excepting eight or\r\nnine canonships and the thirty or forty cantonal curacies, which the\r\ngovernment must approve, he alone makes appointments and without any\r\nperson's concurrence. Thus, in the way of favors, his clerical body has\r\nnothing to expect from anybody but himself.--And, on the other hand,\r\nthey no longer enjoy any protection against his harshness; the hand\r\nwhich punishes is still less restrained than that which rewards; like\r\nthe cathedral chapter, the ecclesiastical tribunal has lost its\r\nconsistency and independence, its efficiency; nothing remains of the\r\nancient bishop's court but an appearance and a name.[5235]\r\n\r\nAt one time, the bishop in person is himself the whole court; he\r\ndeliberates only with himself and decides ex informata conscientia\r\nwithout a trial, without advice, and, if he chooses, in his own cabinet\r\nwith closed doors, in private according to facts, the value of which\r\nhe alone estimates, and through motives of which he is the sole\r\nappreciator. At another time, the presiding magistrate is one of\r\nhis grand-vicars, his revocable delegate, his confidential man, his\r\nmegaphone, in short, another self, and this official acts without the\r\nrestraint of ancient regulations, of a fixed and understood procedure\r\nbeforehand, of a series of judicial formalities, of verifications and\r\nthe presence of witnesses, of the delays and all other legal precautions\r\nwhich guard the judge against prejudice, haste, error, and ignorance and\r\nwithout which justice always risks becoming injustice. In both cases,\r\nthe head over which the sentence is suspended lacks guarantees, and,\r\nonce pronounced, this sentence is definitive. For, on appeal to the\r\ncourt of the metropolitan bishop, it is always confirmed;[5236] the\r\nbishops support each other, and, let the appellant be right or wrong,\r\nthe appeal is in itself a bad mark against him: he did not submit at\r\nonce, he stood out against reproof, he was lacking in humility, he has\r\nset an example of insubordination, and this alone is a grave fault.\r\nThere remains the recourse to Rome; but Rome is far off,[5237] and,\r\nwhile maintaining her superior jurisdiction, she does not willingly\r\ncancel an episcopal verdict; she treats prelates with respect, she is\r\ncareful of her lieutenant-generals, her collectors of Saint Peter's\r\npence. As to the lay tribunals, these have declared themselves\r\nincompetent,[5238] and the new canon law teaches that never, \"under the\r\npretext of a writ of error, may a priest make an appeal to the secular\r\nmagistrate\";[5239] through this appeal, \"he derogates from the authority\r\nand liberty of the Church and is liable to the gravest censures;\" he\r\nbetrays his order.\r\n\r\nSuch is now, for the lower clergy, ecclesiastical law, and likewise\r\nsecular law, both agreeing together in not affording him protection;\r\nadd to this change in the jurisprudence which concerns him a no less\r\ndivisive change in the jurisprudence which concerns him a no less\r\ndecisive change in the titles which place and qualify him. Before 1789,\r\nthere were in France 36,000 curés entitled irremovable; at the present\r\nday, there are only 3,425; before 1789, there were only 2500 curés\r\nentirely removable, while to-day there are 34,042;[5240] all of the\r\nlatter, appointed by the bishop without the approbation of the civil\r\npowers, are removable at his discretion; their parochial ministry is\r\nsimply a provisional commission; they may be placed elsewhere,\r\npassing from one precarious curacy to another no less precarious. \"At\r\nValence,[5241] Mgr. Chartrousse, in one month transferred 150 priests\r\nfrom one parish to another. In 1835, in the diocese of Valence, 35\r\ntransfers were sent out by the same mail.\" No assistant-priest, however\r\nlong in his parish, feels that he is at home there, on his own domain,\r\nfor the rest of his life; he is merely there in garrison, about the same\r\nas lay functionaries and with less security, even when irreproachable.\r\nFor he may be transplanted, not alone for spiritual reasons, but\r\nlikewise for political reasons. He has not grown less worthy, but the\r\nmunicipal council or the mayor have taken a dislike to his person;\r\nconsequently to tranquilize things, he is displaced. Far better, he had\r\nbecome worthy and is on good terms with the municipal council and the\r\nmayor; wherever he has lived he has known how to mollify these,\r\nand consequently \"he is removed from parish to parish,[5242] chosen\r\nexpressly to be put into those where there are troublesome, wrangling,\r\nmalevolent, and impious mayors.\" It is for the good of the service and\r\nin the interest of the Church. The bishop subordinates persons to this\r\nsuperior interest. The legislation of 1801 and 1802 has conferred full\r\npowers upon him and he exercises them; among the many grips by which he\r\nholds his clergy the strongest is the power of removal, and he uses it.\r\nInto all civil or ecclesiastical institutions Napoleon, directly or by\r\ncounterstrokes, has injected his spirit, the military spirit; hence the\r\nauthoritative régime, still more firmly established in the Church than\r\nin the State, because that is the essence of the Catholic institution;\r\nfar from being relaxed in this, it has become stricter; at present it is\r\navowed, proclaimed, and even made canonical; the bishop, in our days,\r\nin fact as in law, is a general of division, and, in law as in fact,\r\nhis curés are simply sergeants or corporals.[5243] Command, from such\r\na lofty grade falls direct, with extraordinary force, on grades so low,\r\nand, at the first stroke, is followed by passive obedience. Discipline\r\nin a diocese is as perfect as in an army corps, and the prelates\r\npublicly take pride in it. \"It is an insult,\" said Cardinal de\r\nBonnechose to the Senate,[5244] \"to suppose that we are not masters\r\nin our own house, that we cannot direct our clergy, and that it is the\r\nclergy which directs us... There is no general within its walls who\r\nwould accept the reproach that could not compel the obedience of\r\nhis soldiers. Each of us has command of a regiment, and the regiment\r\nmarches.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The new Bishop.\r\n\r\n     Change in the habits and ways of the bishop.--His origin,\r\n     age, capability, mode of living, labor, initiative,\r\n     undertakings, and moral and social ascendancy. [5245]\r\n\r\nIn order to make troops march, a staff, even a croisier, is not enough;\r\nto compulsory subordination voluntary subordination must be added;\r\ntherefore, legal authority in the chief should be accompanied with moral\r\nauthority; otherwise he will not be loyally supported and to the end.\r\nIn 1789, this was not the case with the bishop; on two occasions, and at\r\ntwo critical moments, the clergy of the inferior order formed a separate\r\nband, at first at the elections, by selecting for deputies curés and not\r\nprelates, and next in the national assembly, by abandoning the prelates\r\nto unite with the Third Estate. The intimate hold of the chief on\r\nhis men was relaxed or broken. His ascendency over them was no\r\nlonger sufficiently great; they no longer had confidence in him. His\r\nsubordinates had come to regard him as he was, a privileged individual,\r\nsprung from a another stock and furnished by a class apart, bishop by\r\nright of birth, without a prolonged apprenticeship, having rendered no\r\nservices, without tests of merit, almost an interloper in the body of\r\nhis clergy, a Church parasite accustomed to spending the revenues of his\r\ndiocese away from his diocese, idle and ostentatious, often a\r\nshameless gallant or obnoxious hunter, disposed to be a philosopher\r\nand free-thinker, and who lacked two qualifications for a leader of\r\nChristian priests: first, ecclesiastical deportment, and next, and very\r\noften, Christian faith.[5246]\r\n\r\nAll these gaps in and discrepancies of episcopal character, all these\r\ndifferences and distances (which existed before 1789), between the\r\norigins, interests, habits, and manners of the lower and the upper\r\nclergy, all these inequalities and irregularities which alienated\r\ninferiors from the superior, have disappeared; the modern régime has\r\nleveled the wall of separation established by the ancient régime between\r\nthe bishop and his priests. At the present day he is, like them, a\r\nplebeian, of common extraction, and sometimes very low, one being the\r\nson of a village shoemaker, another the natural son of a poor workwoman,\r\nboth being men of feeling and never blushing at their humble origin,\r\nopenly tender and respectful to their mothers,--a certain bishop lodging\r\nhis mother, formerly a servant, in his episcopal palace and giving her\r\nthe first seat at his table among the most honored and noblest of his\r\nguests.[5247] He is \"one of fortune's officers,\" that is to say, a\r\nmeritorious and old officer.[5248] According the \"Almanac\" of 1889, the\r\nthree youngest are from forty-seven to forty-nine years of age; all the\r\nothers are fifty and over; among the latter, three fourths of them are\r\nover sixty. As a general rule, a priest cannot become a bishop short of\r\ntwenty or twenty-five years' service in lower or average grades; he must\r\nhave remained in each grade a longer or shorter period, in turn vicar,\r\ncuré, vicar-general, canon, head of a seminary, sometimes coadjutor,\r\nand almost always have distinguished himself in some office, either\r\nas preacher or catechist, professor or administrator, canonist or\r\ntheologian. His full competence cannot be contested, and he enjoys a\r\nright to exact full obedience; he has himself rendered it up to his\r\nconsecration; \"he boasts of it,\" and the example he proposes to his\r\npriests is the one he has himself given.[5249] On the other hand, his\r\nmoderate way of living excites but little envy; it is about like that of\r\na general of division, or of a prefect, or of a high civil functionary\r\nwho, lacking personal fortune, has nothing but his salary to live on. He\r\ndoes not display, as formerly, confessionals lined with satin, kitchen\r\nutensil of massive silver, hunting accoutrements, a hierarchical staff\r\nof major-domos, ushers, valets, and liveried lackeys, stables and\r\ncarriages, lay grand-seigniors, vassals of his suzerainty and figuring\r\nat his consecration, a princely ceremonial of parade and homage, a\r\npompous show of receptions and of hospitalities. There is nothing but\r\nwhat is necessary, the indispensable instruments of his office: an\r\nordinary carriage for his episcopal journeys and town visits, three\r\nor four domestics for manual service, three or four secretaries for\r\nofficial writings, some old mansion or other, cheaply repaired and\r\nrefurnished without ostentation, its rooms and bureaus being those of an\r\nadministrator, business man, and responsible head of a numerous staff;\r\nin effect, he is responsible for a good many subordinates, he has a\r\ngood deal to attend to; he works himself, looking after the whole and\r\nin detail, keeping classified files by means of a chronological and\r\nsystematic collection,[5250] like the general director of a vast\r\ncompany; if he enjoys greater honors, he is subject to greater\r\nexigencies; assuredly, his predecessors under the ancient régime,\r\ndelicate Epicureans, would not have wished for such a life; they would\r\nnot have considered the benefit worth the effort.\r\n\r\nEven when old, he draws on his energies; he officiates, he preaches,\r\nhe presides at long ceremonies, he ordains seminarians, he confirms\r\nthousands of children,[5251] he visits one after another the parishes\r\nin his diocese; often, at the end of his administration, he has visited\r\nthem all and many times. Meanwhile, shut up in his episcopal cabinet, he\r\nis constantly inspecting these four or five hundred parishes; he reads\r\nor listens to reports, informs himself on the number of communicants, on\r\nwhat is required in worship, on the financial state of the fabrique,\r\non the attitude of the inhabitants, on the good or bad dispositions of\r\nmunicipal counselors and mayors, on the local cause of dissension\r\nand conflict, on the conduct and character of the curé or vicar; each\r\nresident ecclesiastic needs guidance or maintenance between intemperate\r\nzeal and inert lukewarmness, evenly balanced according as parishes and\r\ncircumstances vary, but always in a way to prevent false steps, to turn\r\naside mistakes, to humor opinion, to stop scandals. For the entire\r\nlife of the clergyman, not only his public life but again his personal,\r\ndomestic, private life, belongs to and concerns the Church:[5252] there\r\nmust be no evil reports, even without foundation, on his account;\r\nif these occur, the bishop summons him to headquarters, warns him,\r\nadmonishes him, and, without unburdening himself by handing the\r\nmatter over to a responsible tribunal, he alone passes judgment after\r\npersonally conducting the investigations, suffering the worries, and\r\ncarrying out the painful, painstaking labor always attendant on direct\r\nabsolute power. Likewise, in relation to his upper and his lower\r\nseminary: here are two indispensable nurseries of which he is the head\r\ngardener, attentive to filling annual vacancies and seeking proper\r\nsubjects for these throughout his diocese, ever verifying and\r\ncultivating their vocations; he confers scholarships; he dictates rules\r\nand regulations; appoints and dismisses, displaces and procures as he\r\npleases, the director and professors; he takes them, if he chooses, out\r\nof his diocese or out of the body of regular clergy; he prescribes a\r\ndoctrine to them, methods, ways of thinking and teaching, and he keeps\r\nhis eye, beyond his present or future priests, on three or four hundred\r\nmonks and on fourteen hundred nuns.\r\n\r\nAs to the monks, so long as they remain inside their dwellings, in\r\ncompany together and at home, he has nothing to say to them; but,\r\nwhen they come to preach, confess, officiate or teach in public on his\r\nground, they fall under his jurisdiction; in concert with their superior\r\nand with the Pope, he has rights over them and he uses them. They are\r\nnow his auxiliaries assigned to or summoned by him, available troops and\r\na reinforcement, so many chosen companies expressly ready, each with\r\nits own discipline, its particular uniform, its special weapon, and\r\nwho bring to him in following a campaign under his orders, distinct\r\naptitudes and a livelier zeal. He needs them[5253] in order to make\r\nup for the insufficiency of his local clergy in arousing the spirit\r\nof devotion in his parishes and in enforcing sound doctrine in his\r\nseminaries. Now, between these two forces a common understanding is\r\ndifficult; the former, adjuncts and flying about, march in front; the\r\nlatter, holding the ground and stationary, look upon the new-comers as\r\nusurpers who lessen both their popularity and their fees; a bishop must\r\npossess great tact as well as energy to impose on both bodies of\r\nthis clergy, if not an intimate union, at least mutual aid and a\r\ncollaboration without conflict.--As to the nuns,[5254] he is their\r\nordinary, the sole arbiter, overseer and ruler over all these cloistered\r\nlives; he receives their vows, and renders them free of them; it is he\r\nwho, after due inquiry and examination, authorizes each entrance\r\ninto the community or a return to society, at first each admission or\r\nnovitiate, and next each profession of faith or assumption of the veil,\r\nevery dismissal or departure of a nun, every claim that one makes,\r\nevery grave act of severity or decision on the part of the superior.\r\nHe approves of, or appoints, the confessor of the establishment; he\r\nmaintains seclusion in it, he draws tighter or relaxes the observances;\r\nhe himself enters its doors by privilege of his office, and, with his\r\nown eyes, he inspects its régime, spiritual and temporal, through\r\na right of control which extends from the direction of souls to the\r\nadministration of property.\r\n\r\nTo so many obligatory matters he adds others which are voluntary, not\r\nalone works of piety, those relating to worship, propaganda, diocesan\r\nmissions, catechizing adults, brotherhoods for perpetual adoration,\r\nmeetings for the uninterrupted recital of the rosary, Peter's pence,\r\nseminary funds, Catholic journals and reviews-but, again, institutions\r\nfor charity and education.[5255] In the way of charity, he founds or\r\nsupports twenty different kinds, sixty in one diocese alone, general\r\nand special services, infant nurseries, clubs, asylums, lodging-houses,\r\npatronages, societies for helping and placing the poor, for the sick at\r\nhome and in the hospitals, for suckling infants, for the deaf and dumb,\r\nfor the blind, for old men, for orphans, for repentant prostitutes, for\r\nprisoners, for soldiers in garrison, for workmen, apprentices, youths,\r\nand quantities of others. In the way of education, there are yet more of\r\nthem--works which the Catholic chiefs have most at heart; without these,\r\nit is impossible in modern society to preserve the faith in each new\r\ngeneration. Hence, at each turning-point of political history, we see\r\nthe bishops benefiting by the toleration or warding off the intolerance\r\nof the teaching State, competing with it, erecting alongside of its\r\npublic schools free schools of its own, directed or served by priests\r\nor religious brotherhoods;--after the suppression of the university\r\nmonopoly in 1850, more than one hundred colleges[5256] for secondary\r\neducation; after the favorable law of 1875, four or five provincial\r\nfaculties or universities for superior instruction after the hostile\r\nlaws of 1882, many thousands of parochial schools for primary\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nFoundation and support, all this is expensive. The bishop requires a\r\ngreat deal of money, especially since the State, become ill-disposed,\r\ncuts off clerical resources as much as possible, no longer maintains\r\nscholarships in the seminaries, deprives suspicious desservans of their\r\nsmall stipends, eats into the salaries of the prelates, throws\r\nobstacles in the way of communal liberalities, taxes and over taxes\r\nthe congregations, so that, not merely through the diminution of its\r\nallowances it relieves itself at the expense of the Church, but again,\r\nthrough the increase of its imposts, it burdens the Church for its\r\nown advantage. The episcopacy obtains all necessary funds through\r\ncollections in the churches and at domiciles, through the gifts and\r\nsubscriptions of the faithful; and, every year, it needs millions, apart\r\nfrom the budget appropriation, for its faculties and universities\r\nin which it installs largely paid professors, for the construction,\r\nlocation and arrangement of its countless buildings, for the expenses of\r\nits minor schools, for the support of its ten thousand seminarists, for\r\nthe general out-lay on so many charitable institutions; and it is the\r\nbishop who, their principal promoter, must provide for this, all the\r\nmore because he has often taken it upon himself in advance, and made\r\nhimself responsible for it by either a written or verbal promise. He\r\nresponds to all these engagements; he has funds on hand at the maturity\r\nof each contract. In 1883, the bishop of Nancy, in need of one hundred\r\nthousand francs to build a school-house with a work-room attached to it,\r\nmentions this to a number of persons assembled in his drawing-room; one\r\nof these puts his hand in his pocket and gives him ten thousand francs,\r\nand others subscribe on the spot to the amount of seventy-four thousand\r\nfrancs.[5257] Cardinal Mathieu, during his administration, archbishop\r\nof Besançon, thus collects and expends four millions. Lately, Cardinal\r\nLavigerie, to whom the budget allows fifteen thousand francs per\r\nannum, wrote that he had spent eighteen hundred thousand francs and had\r\nincurred no debt.[5258]--Through this initiative and this ascendancy the\r\nbishop becomes a central social rallying-point; there is no other in\r\nthe provinces, nothing but so many disjointed lives, juxtaposed and kept\r\ntogether in an artificial circle prescribed from above; so that a\r\ngood many of these, and of most consideration, gravitate to and group\r\nthemselves, especially since 1830, around this last permanent center and\r\nform a part of its body; he is the sole germinating, vivifying, intact\r\ncenter that still agglutinates scattered wills and suitably organizes\r\nthem. Naturally, class and party interests incorporate themselves\r\nadditionally along with the Catholic interest which he represents, and\r\nhis ecclesiastical authority becomes a political influence; besides\r\nhis secular and regular clergy, over and beyond the two thousand five\r\nhundred exemplary or directorial lives which he controls, we see\r\nbehind him an indefinite multitude of lay adhesions and devotedness.\r\nConsequently, every government must take him into their calculations,\r\nand all the more because his colleagues stand by him; the episcopacy,\r\nbanded together, remains erect in face of the omnipotent State, under\r\nthe July monarchy as claimants of free instruction and under the second\r\nempire in support of the temporal power of the Pope.--In this militant\r\nattitude, the figure of the bishop is fully unveiled; the titular\r\nchampion of an infallible Church, himself a believer and submissive; his\r\nvoice is extraordinarily proud and defiant;[5259] in his own eyes, he\r\nis the unique depository of truth and morality; in the eyes of his\r\nfollowers, he becomes a superhuman personage, a prophet of salvation or\r\nof destruction, the annunciator of divine judgments, the dispenser of\r\ncelestial anger or of celestial pardon; he rises to the clouds in an\r\napotheosis of glory; with women especially, this veneration grows into\r\nenthusiasm and degenerates into idolatry. Towards the end of the second\r\nempire an eminent French bishop, on a steamboat on Lake Leman, taking\r\na roll of bread from his pocket, seated himself alongside of two ladies\r\nand ate it, handing each of them a piece of it. One of them, bowing\r\nreverently, replied to him, \"At your hands, my lord, this is almost the\r\nholy communion!\"[5260]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The subordinate clergy.\r\n\r\n     The subordinates.--The secular clergy.--Its derivation and\r\n     how recruited.--How prepared and led.--The lower seminary.--\r\n     The higher seminary.--Monthly lectures and annual retreat.--\r\n     The Exercitia.--The Manreze du Prêtre.--The curé in his\r\n     parish.--His rôle a difficult one.--His patience and correct\r\n     conduct.\r\n\r\nA clergy submissive in mind and feeling, long prepared by its condition\r\nand education for faith and obedience, acts under the sway of this\r\nsovereign and consecrated hand.[5261] Among the 40,000 curés and\r\ndesservans \"more than 35,000 belong to the laboring class of workmen and\r\npeasants,\"[5262] not the first class of peasants, but the second class,\r\nthe poorer families earning their daily bread and often with a good many\r\nchildren. Under the pressure of the ambient atmosphere and of the modern\r\nrégime, the others keep back their sons, retaining them for the world\r\nand denying them to the Church; ambition, even low down on the scale,\r\nhas developed itself and changed its object. No longer do they aspire\r\nfor their sons to become a curé but a school master, a railroad\r\nemployee, or a commercial clerk.[5263] It was necessary to go descend\r\nfurther, a lower stratum has to be attained, in order to extract from it\r\nthe priests that are lacking.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, at this depth, the extraction was more expensive; the\r\nfamily cannot afford to pay for the child's ecclesiastic cal education;\r\nthe State, moreover, after 1830, no longer gives anything to the lower\r\nseminary, nor to the large one after 1885.[5264] The expenses of these\r\nschools must be borne by the faithful in the shape of donations and\r\nlegacies; to this end, the bishop orders collections in the churches in\r\nLent and encourages his diocesans to found scholarships. The outlay for\r\nthe support and education, nearly gratis, of a future priest between\r\nthe ages of twelve and twenty-four is very great; in the lower seminary\r\nalone it costs from forty to fifty thousand francs over and above the\r\nnet receipts;[5265] facing such an annual deficit, the bishop, who is\r\nresponsible for the undertaking, is greatly concerned and sometimes\r\nextremely anxious. To make amends, and as compensation, the extraction\r\nis surer; the long process by which a child is withdrawn and instructed\r\nfor the priesthood goes on and is finished with less uncertainty.\r\nNeither the light nor the murmur of the century finds its way to these\r\nlow depths; nobody ever reads the newspaper, even the penny paper;\r\nvocations can here shape themselves and become fixed like crystals,\r\nintact and rigid, and all of a piece; they are better protected than in\r\nthe upper layers, less exposed to mundane infiltrations; they run less\r\nrisk of being disturbed or thwarted by curiosity, reason and skepticism,\r\nby modern ideas; the outside world and family surroundings do not, as\r\nelsewhere, interfere with their silent internal workings.[5266] When the\r\nchoir-boy comes home after the service, when the seminarian returns\r\nto his parents in his vacations, he does not here en-counter so many\r\ndisintegrating influences, various kinds of information, free and easy\r\ntalk, comparisons between careers, concern about advancement, habits\r\nof comfort, maternal solicitude, the shrugs of the shoulder and the\r\nhalf-smile of the strong-minded neighbor. Stone upon stone and each\r\nstone in its place, his faith builds up and becomes complete without\r\nany incoherency in its structure, with no incongruity in the materials,\r\nwithout any hidden imbalance. He has been taken in hand before his\r\ntwelfth year, when very young; his curé, who has been instructed from\r\nabove to secure suitable subjects, has singled him out in the catechism\r\nclass and again at the ceremony of confirmation;[5267] he is found to\r\nhave a pious tendency and a taste for sacred ceremonies, a suitable\r\ndemeanor, a mild disposition, complacency, and is inclined to study; he\r\nis a docile and well-behaved child; whether an acolyte at the altar\r\nor in the sacristy, he tries to fold the chasuble properly; all his\r\ngenuflexions are correct, they do not worry him, he has no trouble in\r\nstanding still, he is not excited and diverted, like the others, by the\r\neruptions of animal spirits and rustic coarseness. If his rude brain is\r\nopen to cultivation, if grammar and Latin can take root in it, the curé\r\nor the vicar at once take charge of him; he studies under them, gratis\r\nor nearly so, until he has completed the sixth or the seventh grade, and\r\nthen he enters the lower seminary.[5268]\r\n\r\nThis is a school apart, a boarding-house of picked youths, an enclosed\r\nhot-house intended for the preservation and development of special\r\nvocations. None of these schools existed previous to 1789; at the\r\npresent day(in 1885), they number 86 in France, and all the pupils\r\nare to become future priests. No foreign plants, no future laymen, are\r\nadmitted into this preparatory nursery;[5269] for experience has\r\nshown that if the lower seminary is mixed it no longer attains its\r\necclesiastical purpose; \"it habitually turns over to the upper\r\nseminary only the bottom of the classes; those at the top seek fortune\r\nelsewhere\". But if, on the contrary, \"the lower seminaries are kept\r\npure, the entire rhetoric[5270] class continues on into the upper\r\nseminary; not only do they obtain the bottom of the classes but the\r\ntop.\"--The culture, in this second nursery, which is prolonged during\r\nfive years, becomes extreme, wholly special; it was less so under the\r\nancient régime, even at Saint-Sulpice; there were cracks in the glass\r\nletting in currents of air; the archbishop's nephews and the younger\r\nsons of nobles predestined for Church dignities had introduced into\r\nit the laxity and liberties which were then the privileges of the\r\nepiscopacy. During the vacations,[5271] fairy scenes and pastorals were\r\nperformed there with costumes and dances, \"The Enthronement of the Great\r\nMogul,\" and the \"Shepherds in Chains\"; the seminarians took great care\r\nof their hair; a first-class hair-dresser came and waited on them; the\r\ndoors were not regularly shut: the youthful Talleyrand knew how to get\r\nout into the city and begin or continue his gallantries.[5272] From\r\nand after the Concordat, stricter discipline in the new seminaries had\r\nbecome monastic; these are practical schools, not for knowledge, but for\r\ntraining, the object being much less to make learned men than believing\r\npriests; education takes precedence of instruction and intellectual\r\nexercises are made subordinate to spiritual exercises[5273]--mass every\r\nday and five visits to the Saint-Sacrament, with one minute to half-hour\r\nprayer stations; rosaries of sixty-three paters and aves, litanies,\r\nthe angelus, loud and whispered prayers, special self-examinations,\r\nmeditation on the knees, edifying readings in common, silence until\r\none o'clock in the afternoon, silence at meals and the listening to an\r\nedifying discourse, frequent communions, weekly confessions, general\r\nconfession at New-year's, one day of retreat at the end of every month\r\nafter the vacations and before the collation of each of the four orders,\r\neight days of retirement during which a suspension of all study, morning\r\nand evening sermons, spiritual readings, meditations, orisons and other\r\nservices from hour to hour;[5274] in short, the daily and systematic\r\napplication of a wise and steadily perfected method, the most\r\nserviceable for fortifying faith, exalting the imagination, giving\r\ndirection and impulse to the will, analogous to that of a military\r\nschool, Saint-Cyr or Saumur, to such an extent that its corporeal and\r\nmental imprint is indelible, and that by the way in which he thinks,\r\ntalks, smiles, bows and stands in your presence we at once recognize a\r\nformer pupil of Saint-Sulpice as we do a former pupil of Saumur and of\r\nSaint-Cyr. Thus graduated, an ordained and consecrated priest, first\r\na vicar and then a curé desservant, the discipline which has bound and\r\nfashioned him still keeps him erect and presenting arms. Besides his\r\nduties in church and his ministrations in the homes of his parishioners,\r\nbesides masses, vespers, sermons, catechisings, confessions, communions,\r\nbaptisms, marriages, extreme unctions, funerals, visiting the sick and\r\nsuffering, he has his personal and private exercises: at first, his\r\nbreviary, the reading of which demands each day an hour and a half, no\r\npractical duty being so necessary. Lamennais obtained a dispensation\r\nfrom it, and hence his lapses and fall.[5275] Let no one object that\r\nsuch a recitation soon becomes mechanical[5276]; the prayers, phrases\r\nand words which it buries deep in the mind, even wandering, necessarily\r\nbecome fixed inhabitants in it, and hence occult and stirring powers\r\nbanded together which encompass the intellect and lay siege to the will,\r\nwhich, in the subterranean regions of the soul, gradually extend or\r\nfortify their silent occupation of the place, which insensibly operate\r\non the man without his being aware of it, and which, at critical\r\nmoments, unexpectedly rise up to steady his footsteps or to save him\r\nfrom temptation. Add to this antique custom two modern institutions\r\nwhich contribute to the same end. The first one is the monthly\r\nconference, which brings together the desservans curés at the residence\r\nof the oldest curé in the canton; each has prepared a study on some\r\ntheme furnished by the bishopric, some question of dogma, morality or\r\nreligious history, which he reads aloud and discusses with his brethren\r\nunder the presidency and direction of the oldest curé, who gives his\r\nfinal decision; this keeps theoretical knowledge and ecclesiastical\r\nerudition fresh in the minds of both reader and hearers. The other\r\ninstitution, almost universal nowadays, is the annual retreat which the\r\npriests in the diocese pass in the large seminary of the principal town.\r\nThe plan of it was traced by Saint Ignatius; his Exercitia is still\r\nto-day the manual in use, the text of which is literally,[5277] or very\r\nnearly, followed.[5278] The object is to reconstitute the supernatural\r\nworld in the soul, for, in general, it evaporates, becomes effaced, and\r\nceases to be palpable under the pressure of the natural world. Even the\r\nfaithful pay very little attention to it, while their vague conception\r\nof it ends in becoming a mere verbal belief; it is essential to give\r\nthem back the positive sensation, the contact and feeling. To this\r\nend, a man retires to a suitable place, where what he does actively or\r\npassively is hourly determined for him in advance--attendance at chapel\r\nor at preaching, telling his beads, litanies, orisons aloud, orisons in\r\nhis own breast, repeated self-examination, confession and the rest--in\r\nshort, an uninterrupted series of diversified and convergent ceremonies\r\nwhich, by calculated degrees, drive out terrestrial preoccupations\r\nand overcome him with spiritual impressions; immediately around him,\r\nimpressions of the same kind followed by the contagion of example,\r\nmutual fervor, common expectation, involuntary emulation, and that\r\noverstrained eagerness which creates its object; with all the more\r\ncertainty that the individual himself works on himself, in silence, five\r\nhours a day, according to the prescriptions of a profound psychology, in\r\norder that his bare conception may take upon itself body and substance.\r\nWhat-ever may be the subject of his meditations, he repeats it twice the\r\nsame day, and each time he begins by \"creating the scene,\" the Nativity\r\nor the Passion, the Day of Judgment or Hell; he converts the remote and\r\nundefined story, the dry, abstract dogma, into a detailed and figured\r\nrepresentation; he dwells on it, he evokes in turn the images furnished\r\nby the five senses, visual, audible, tactile, olfactory, and even\r\ngustatory; he groups them together, and in the evening he animates them\r\nafresh in order that he may find them more intense when he awakes the\r\nnext morning. He thus obtains the complete, precise, almost physical\r\nspectacle of his aspirations; he reaches the alibi, that mental\r\ntransposition, that reversal of the points of view in which the order\r\nof certainties becomes inverted, in which substantial objects seem to\r\nbe vain phantoms and the mystic world a world of substantial\r\nreality.[5279]--According to persons and circumstances, the theme for\r\nmeditation differs, and the retreat is prolonged for a shorter or longer\r\nperiod. For laymen, it generally lasts for three days only; for the\r\nBrethren of the Christian Schools it is eight days annually, and when,\r\nat the age of twenty-eight, they take their vows in perpetuity, it lasts\r\nthirty days: for the secular priests, it lasts a little less than a\r\nweek, while the theme on which their meditations are concentrated is the\r\nsupernatural character of the priest. The priest who is confessor and\r\nministrant of the Eucharist, the priest who is the savior and restorer,\r\nthe priest who is pastor, preacher and administrator--such are the\r\nsubjects on which their imagination, assisted and directed, must work\r\nin order to compose the cordial which has to support them for the entire\r\nyear. None is more potent; that which the Puritans drank at an American\r\ncamp-meeting or at a Scotch revival was stronger but of less enduring\r\neffect.[5280]\r\n\r\nTwo different cordials, one reinforcing the other, are mixed together in\r\nthis drink, both being of high flavor and so rank as to burn an ordinary\r\nmouth. On the one hand, with the freedom of language and the boldness\r\nof deduction characteristic of the method, the sentiment of the priest's\r\ndignity is exalted. What is the priest?\"He is, between God who is in\r\nheaven and the man who tries to find him on earth, a being, God and\r\nman, who brings these nearer by his symbolizing both.[5281].. I do not\r\nflatter you with pious hyperboles in calling you gods; this is not\r\na rhetorical falsehood.... You are creators similar to Mary in her\r\ncooperation in the Incarnation.... You are creators like God in time....\r\nYou are creators like God in eternity. Our creation on our part, our\r\ndaily creation, is nothing less than the Word made flesh itself.... God\r\nmay create other worlds, he cannot so order it that any act under the\r\nsun can be greater than your sacrifice; for, at this moment, he reposes\r\nin your hands all that he has and all that he is.... I am not a little\r\nlower than the cherubim and seraphim in the government of the world,\r\nI am far above them; they are only the Servants of God, we are his\r\ncoadjutors.... The angels, who behold the vast riches passing through\r\nour hands daily, are amazed at our prerogative.... I fulfill three\r\nsublime functions in relation to the god of our altars--I cause him\r\nto descend, I administer his body, I am his custodian... . Jesus dwells\r\nunder your lock and key; his hours of reception begin and end through\r\nyou, he does not move without your permission, he gives no benediction\r\nwithout your assistance, he bestows nothing except at your hands, and\r\nhis dependence is so dear to him that, for eighteen hundred years, he\r\nhas not left the Church for one moment to lose himself on the glory of\r\nhis Father.\"--On the other hand, they are made to drink in full\r\ndraughts the sentiment of subordination, which they imbibe to their very\r\nmarrow.[5282] \"Ecclesiastical obedience is... a love of dependence, a\r\nviolation of judgment.... Would you know what it is as to the extent\r\nof sacrifice? A voluntary death, the sepulcher of the will, says Saint\r\nClimaque.... There is a sort of real presence infused into those\r\nwho command us....\" Let us be careful not to fall \"into the crafty\r\nopposition of liberal Catholicism.... Liberalism, in its consequences,\r\nis social atheism.... Unity, in Roman faith, is not sufficient; let us\r\nlabor together in the unity of the Roman spirit; for that, let us\r\nalways judge Rome with the optimism of affection.... Each new dogmatic\r\ndefinition produces its own advantages: that of the Immaculate\r\nConception has given us Lourdes and its truly oecumenical wonders.\"\r\n\r\nNothing of all this is too much, and, in the face of the exigencies\r\nof modern times, it scarcely suffices. Now that society has become\r\nincredulous, indifferent or, at the least, secular, the priest must\r\npossess the two intense and master ideas which support a soldier abroad\r\namong insurgents or barbarians, one being the conviction that he is of\r\na species and essence apart, infinitely superior to the common herd;\r\nand the other is the thought that he belongs to his flag, to his chiefs,\r\nespecially to the commanding general, and that he has given himself\r\nup entirely to prompt obedience, to obeying every order issued without\r\nquestion or doubt.[5283] Thus, in that parish where the permanent curé\r\nwas once installed, especially in the rural districts,[5284] the\r\nlegal and popular governor of all souls, his successor, the removable\r\ndesservant, is merely a resident bailiff, a sentry in his box, at the\r\nopening of a road which the public at large no longer travel. From time\r\nto time he hails you! But scarcely any one listens to him. Nine out of\r\nten men pass at a distance, along a newer, more convenient and broader\r\nroad. They either nod to him afar off or give him the go-by. Some are\r\neven ill-disposed, watching him or denouncing him to the ecclesiastic or\r\nlay authorities on which he depends. He is expected to make his orders\r\nrespected and yet not hated, to be zealous and yet not importunate, to\r\nact and yet not efface himself: he succeeds pretty often, thanks to\r\nthe preparation just described, and, in his rural sentry-box, patient,\r\nresigned, obeying his orders, he mounts guard lonely and in solitude, a\r\nguard which, for the past fifteen years, (from 1870-1885) is disturbed\r\nand anxious and becoming singularly difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5201: Artaud, \"Histoire de Pie VII.\", I., 167.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5202: Comte d'Haussonville, \"L'Église romaine et le premier\r\nEmpire, IV.,378, 415.

M. Emery, the reformer of Saint-Sulpice, gave the\r\nimpulsion in this sense. (\"Histoire de M. Emery,\" by Abbé Elie Méric, p.\r\n115 etc.) M. Emery addressed the seminarians thus: \"Do you think that,\r\nif we pray to the Holy Virgin sixty times a day to aid us at the hour\r\nof death, she will desert us at the last moment?\"--\" He led us into the\r\nchapel, which he had decked with reliquaries....

(\"Histoire du cardinal Pie,\" by M. Bannard,\r\nII.,348 and passim.) There was a statuette of the Virgin on his bureau.\r\nAfter his death, a quantity of paper scraps, in Latin or French, written\r\nand placed there by him-were found, dedicating this or that action,\r\njourney or undertaking under the special patronage of the Virgin or St.\r\nJoseph.

The regular clergy.\r\n\r\n     The regular clergy.--Difference in the condition of the two\r\n     clergies.--The three vows.--Rules.--Life in common.--Object\r\n     of the system.--Violent suppression of the institution and\r\n     its abuses in 1790.--Spontaneous revival of the institution\r\n     free of its abuses after 1800.--Democratic and republican\r\n     character of monastic constitutions.--Vegetation of the old\r\n     stock and multiplication of new plants,--Number of monks and\r\n     nuns.--Proportion of these numbers to the total population\r\n     in 1789 and 1878.--Predominance of the organizations for\r\n     labor and charity.--How formed and extended.--Social\r\n     instinct and contact with the mystic world.\r\n\r\nHowever correct the life of a secular priest may be, he stills belongs\r\nto his century. Like a layman, he has his own domicile and fireside, his\r\nparsonage in the country with a garden, or an apartment in town--in\r\nany event, his own home and household, a servant or housekeeper, who is\r\noften either his mother or a sister; in short, a suitable enclosure\r\nset apart, where he can enjoy his domestic and private life free of the\r\nencroachments on his public and ecclesiastical life, analogous to that\r\nof a lay functionary or a bachelor of steady habits. In effect, his\r\nexpenses and income, his comforts and discomforts are about the same.\r\nHis condition, his salary,[5301] his table, clothes and furniture, his\r\nout-of-door ways and habits, give him rank in the village alongside of\r\nthe schoolteacher and postmaster; in the large borough or small town,\r\nalongside of the justice of the peace and college professor; in the\r\nlarge towns, side by side with the head of a bureau or a chief of\r\ndivision; at Paris, in certain parishes, alongside of the prefect of\r\npolice and the prefect of the Seine.[5302] Even in the humblest curacy,\r\nhe regulates his budget monthly, spending his money without consulting\r\nanybody. When not on duty, his time is his own. He can dine out, order\r\nfor himself at home a special dish, allow himself delicacies. If he does\r\nnot possess every comfort, he has most of them, and thus, like a\r\nlay functionary, he may if he chooses get ahead in the world, obtain\r\npromotion to a better curacy, become irremovable, be appointed canon and\r\nsometimes mount upward, very high, to the topmost rank. Society has a\r\nhold on him through all these worldly purposes; he is too much mixed\r\nup with it to detach himself from it entirely; very often his\r\nspiritual life droops or proves abortive under so many terrestrial\r\npreoccupations.--If the Christian desires to arrive at the alibi and\r\ndwell in the life beyond, another system of existence is essential for\r\nhim, entailing a protection against two temptations, that is to say the\r\nabandonment of two dangerous liberties, one consisting in the power\r\nby which, being an owner of property, he disposes as he likes of what\r\nbelongs to him, and the other consisting in the power by which, being\r\nmaster of his acts, he arranges as he pleases his daily occupations. To\r\nthis end, in addition to the vow of chastity also taken by the secular\r\npriest, the members of religious orders also take two other distinct and\r\nprecise vows. By the vow of poverty he (or she) renounces all property\r\nwhatever, at least that which is fully and completely his own,[5303]\r\nthe arbitrary use of possessions, the enjoyment of what belongs to\r\nhim personally, which vow leads him to live like a poor man, to\r\nendure privations, to labor, and beyond this, even to fasting, to\r\nmortifications, to counteracting and deadening in himself all those\r\ninstincts by which man rebels against bodily suffering and aims at\r\nphysical well being. By the vow of obedience he (or she) gives himself\r\nup entirely to a double authority: one, in writing, which is discipline,\r\nand the other a living being, consisting of the superior whose business\r\nit is to interpret, apply and enforce the rule. Except in unheard-of\r\ncases, where the superior's injunctions might be expressly and directly\r\nopposed to the letter of this rule,[5304] he interdicts himself from\r\nexamining, even in his own breast, the motives, propriety and occasion\r\nof the act prescribed to him; he has alienated in advance future\r\ndeterminations by entirely abandoning self-government; hence-forth,\r\nhis internal motor is outside of himself and in another person.\r\nConsequently, the unforeseen and spontaneous initiative of free will\r\ndisappears in his conduct to give way to a predetermined, obligatory and\r\nfixed command, to a system (cadre) which envelops him and binds together\r\nin its rigid compartments the entire substance and details of his life,\r\nanticipating the distribution of his time for a year, week by week, and\r\nfor every day, hour by hour, defining imperatively and circumstantially\r\nall action or inaction, physical or mental, all work and all leisure,\r\nsilence and speech, prayers and readings, abstinences and meditations,\r\nsolitude and companionship, hours for rising and retiring, meals,\r\nquantity and quality of food, attitudes, greetings, manners, tone and\r\nforms of language and, still better, mute thoughts and the deepest\r\nsentiments. Moreover, through the periodical repetition of the same acts\r\nat the same hours, lie confines himself to a cycle of habits which are\r\nforces, and which keep growing since they are ever turning the inward\r\nbalance on the same side through the ever-increasing weight of his\r\nentire past. Through eating and lodging together, through a communion\r\nof prayer, through incessant contact with other brethren of the same\r\nreligious observances, through the precaution taken to join with him one\r\ncompanion when he goes out and two companions when he lodges elsewhere,\r\nthrough his visits to and fro to the head establishment, he lives in a\r\ncircle of souls strained to the same extent, by the same processes,\r\nto the same end as himself, and whose visible zeal maintains his\r\nown.--Grace, in this state of things, abounds. Such is the term bestowed\r\non the silent and steady, or startling and brusque, emotion by which\r\nthe Christian enters into communication with the invisible world, an\r\naspiration and a hope, a presentiment and a divination, and even often a\r\ndistinct perception. Evidently, this grace is not far off, almost within\r\nreach of the souls which, from the tenor of their whole life, strive\r\nto attain it. They have closed themselves off on the earthly side,\r\ntherefore, these can no longer look or breathe otherwise than\r\nheavenward.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, the monastic institution no longer\r\nproduced this effect; deformed, weakened and discredited through\r\nits abuses, especially in the convents of males, and then violently\r\noverthrown by the Revolution, it seemed to be dead. But, at the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, behold it springing up again\r\nspontaneously, in one direct, new, strong and active jet and higher than\r\nthe old one, free of the excrescences, rottenness and parasites\r\nwhich, under the ancient régime, disfigured and discolored it. No more\r\ncompulsory vows, no \"frocked\" younger sons \"to make an elder,\" no girls\r\nimmured from infancy, kept in the convent throughout their youth, led\r\non, urged, and then driven into a corner and forced into the final\r\nengagement on becoming of age; no more aristocratic institutions, no\r\nOrder of Malta and chapters of men or of women in which noble families\r\nfind careers and a receptacle for their supernumerary children. No more\r\nof those false and counterfeit vocations the real motive of which was,\r\nsometimes pride of race and the determination not to lose a social\r\nstanding, sometimes the animal attractions of physical comfort,\r\nindolence and idleness. No more lazy and opulent monks, occupied,\r\nlike the Carthusians of Val Saint-Pierre, in overeating, stupefied\r\nby digestion and routine, or, like the Bernardines of Granselve[5305]\r\nturning their building into a worldly rendezvous for jovial hospitality\r\nand themselves taking part, foremost in rank, in prolonged and\r\nfrequent parties, balls, plays and hunting-parties; in diversions and\r\ngallantries which the annual fête of Saint Bernard, through a singular\r\ndissonance, excited and consecrated. No more over-wealthy superiors,\r\nusufructuaries of a vast abbatial revenue, suzerain and landlord\r\nseigniors, with the train, luxury and customs of their condition,\r\nwith four-horse carriages, liveries, officials, antechamber, court,\r\nchancellorship and ministers of justice, obliging their monks to address\r\nthem as \"my lord,\" as lax as any ordinary layman, well fitted to cause\r\nscandal in their order by their liberties and to set an example of\r\ndepravity. No more lay intrusions, commendatory abbés or priors,\r\ninterlopers, and imposed from above; no more legislative and\r\nadministrative interferences[5306] in order to bind monks and nuns\r\ndown to their vows, to disqualify them and deprive them almost of\r\ncitizenship, to exclude them from common rights, to withhold from them\r\nrights of inheritance and testamentary rights, from receiving or making\r\ndonations, depriving them in advance of the means of subsistence, to\r\nconfine them by force in their convents and set the patrol on their\r\ntrack, and, on trying to escape, to furnish their superior with secular\r\nhelp and keep down insubordination by physical constraint. Nothing of\r\nthis subsists after the great destruction of 1790. Under the modern\r\nrégime, if any one enters and remains in a convent it is because the\r\nconvent is more agreeable to him than the world outside; there is no\r\nother motive no pressure or hindrance of an inferior or different kind,\r\nno direct or indirect, no domestic or legal constraint, no ambition,\r\nvanity and innate or acquired indolence, no certainty of finding\r\nsatisfaction for a coarse and concentrated sensuality. That which now\r\noperates is the awakened and persistent vocation; the man or the woman\r\nwho takes vows and keeps them, enters upon and adheres to his or her\r\nengagement only through a spontaneous act deliberately and constantly\r\nrenewed through their own free will.\r\n\r\nThus purified, the monastic institution recovers its normal form, which\r\nis the republican and democratic form, while the impracticable Utopia\r\nwhich the philosophers of the eighteenth century wanted to impose on\r\nlay society now becomes the effective régime under which the religious\r\ncommunities are going to live. In all of them, the governors are elected\r\nby the governed; whether the suffrage is universal or qualified, one\r\nvote is as good as another; votes are counted by heads, and, at\r\nstated intervals, the sovereign majority uses its right anew; with the\r\nCarmelites, it is every three years and to elect by secret ballot, not\r\nalone one authority but all the authorities, the prior, the sub-prior\r\nand the three clavières.[5307]--Once elected, the chief, in conformity\r\nwith his mandate, remains a mandatory, that is to say a laborer assigned\r\na certain work, and not a privileged person enjoying a gratification.\r\nHis dignity is not a dispensation, but an additional burden; along with\r\nthe duties of his office, he subjects himself to an observance of the\r\nrules--having become a general, he is no better off than the simple\r\nsoldier; he rises as early and his daily life is no better; his cell is\r\nas bare and his personal support not more expensive. He who commands\r\nten thousand others lives as poorly, under the same strict instructions,\r\nwith as few conveniences and with less leisure than the meanest\r\nbrother.[5308] Over and above the austerities of ordinary discipline\r\nthis or that superior imposed on himself additional mortifications which\r\nwere so great as to astonish as well as edify his monks. Such is the\r\nideal State of the theorist, a Spartan republic, and for all, including\r\nthe chiefs, an equal ration of the same black broth. There is another\r\nresemblance, still more profound. At the base of this republic lies\r\nthe corner-stone designed in anticipation by Rousseau, then hewn and\r\nemployed, well or ill, in the constitutions or plébiscites of the\r\nRevolution, the Consulate and the Empire, to serve as the foundation of\r\nthe complete edifice. This stone is a primitive and solemn agreement by\r\nall concerned, a social contract, a pact proposed by the legislator and\r\naccepted by the citizens; except that, in the monastic pact, the will of\r\nthe acceptors is unanimous, earnest, serious, deliberate and permanent,\r\nwhile, in the political pact, it is not so; thus, whilst the latter\r\ncontract is a theoretical fiction, the former is an actual verity.\r\n\r\nFor, in the small religious cité, all precautions are taken to have the\r\nfuture citizen know for what and how far he engages himself. The copy of\r\nthe rules which is handed to him in advance explains to him the future\r\nuse of each day and of each hour, the detail in full of the régime to\r\nwhich he is to subject himself. Besides this, to forestall any illusion\r\nand haste on his part he is required to make trial of the confinement\r\nand discipline; he realizes through personal, sensible and prolonged\r\nexperience what he must undergo; before assuming the habit, he must\r\nserve a novitiate of at least one year and without interruption. Simple\r\nvows sometimes precede the more solemn vows; with the Jesuits, several\r\nnovitiates, each lasting two or three years, overlie and succeed each\r\nother. Elsewhere, the perpetual engagement is taken only after several\r\ntemporary engagements; up to the age of twenty-five the \"Fréres des\r\nEcoles Chrétiennes\" take their vows for a year; at twenty-five for three\r\nyears; only at twenty-eight do they take them for life. Certainly,\r\nafter such trials, the postulant is fully informed; nevertheless, his\r\nsuperiors contribute what they know. They have watched him day after\r\nday; deep down under his superficial, actual and declared disposition\r\nthey define his profound, latent, and future intention; if they deem\r\nthis insufficient or doubtful, they adjourn or prevent the final\r\nprofession: \"My child, wait-your vocation is not yet determined,\" or \"My\r\nfriend, you were not made for the convent, return to the world!\"--Never\r\nwas a social contract signed more knowingly, after greater reflection\r\non what choice to make, after such deliberate study: the conditions of\r\nhuman association demanded by the revolutionary theory are all fulfilled\r\nand the dream of the Jacobins is realized. But not where they planned\r\nit: through a strange contrast, and which seems ironical in history,\r\nthis day-dream of speculative reason has produced nothing in the lay\r\norder of things but elaborate plans on paper, a deceptive and dangerous\r\nDeclaration of (human) Rights, appeals to insurrection or to a\r\ndictatorship: incoherent or still-born organizations, in short,\r\nabortions or monsters; in the religious order of things, it adds to the\r\nliving world thousands of living creatures of indefinite viability. So\r\nthat, among the effects of the French revolution, one of the principal\r\nand most enduring is the restoration of monastic institutions....\r\n\r\nFrom the Consulate down to the present day they can everywhere be seen\r\nsprouting and growing. Early, new sprouts shoot out and cover the old\r\ntrunks of which the revolutionary axe had cut off the branches. In 1800,\r\n\"the re-establishment of a corporation shocked current ideas.\"[5309] But\r\nthe able administrators of the Consulate required volunteer women for\r\nservice in their hospitals. In Paris, Chaptal, the minister, comes\r\nacross a lady superior whom he formerly knew and enjoins her to gather\r\ntogether ten or a dozen of her surviving companions; he installs them in\r\nthe rue Vieux-Colombier, in a building belonging to the hospitals, and\r\nwhich he furnishes for forty novices; at Lyons, he notices that the\r\n\"Sisters\" of the general hospital were obliged, that they might perform\r\ntheir duties, to wear a lay dress; he authorizes them to resume their\r\ncostume and their crosses; he allows them two thousand francs to\r\npurchase necessaries, and, when they have donned their old uniform, he\r\npresents them to the First Consul. Such is the first sprout, very small\r\nand very feeble, that appears in the institution of Saint-Vincent\r\nde Paule at Paris and in that of Saint-Charles at Lyons. In our\r\ndays[5310](around 1885), the congregation of Saint-Charles, besides\r\nthe parent-house at Lyons, has 102 others with 2,226 nuns, and the\r\ncongregation of Saint-Vincent de Paule, besides the parent-house at\r\nParis, has 88 others with 9,130 nuns. Often, the new vegetation on the\r\ntrunk amputated by the Revolution is much richer than on the old one;\r\nin 1789, the institution of the \"Fréres des Ecoles Chrétiennes\" had\r\n800 members; in 1845, there were 4,000; in 1878, 9,818; on the 31st of\r\nDecember, 1888, there were 12,245. In 1789, it counted 126 houses; in\r\n1888, there were 1,286.--Meanwhile, alongside of the old plantations, a\r\nlarge number of independent germs, new species and varieties, spring up\r\nspontaneously, each with its own aim, rules and special denomination.\r\nOn Good Friday, April 6, 1792, at the very date of the decree of the\r\nLegislative Assembly abolishing all religious communities,[5311] one is\r\nborn, that of the \"Soeurs de la Retraite Chrétienne,\" at Fontenelle, and,\r\nfrom year to year, similar plants constantly and suddenly spring out of\r\nthe ground for a century. The list is too long to be counted; a large\r\nofficial volume of more than four hundred pages is filled with the\r\nmere statement of their names, localities and statistics.--This volume,\r\npublished in 1878, divides religious institutions into two groups. We\r\nfind in the first one, comprising the legally authorized societies, at\r\nfirst 5 congregations of men possessing 224 establishments with 2,418\r\nmembers, and 23 associations of men with 20,341 members and supplying\r\n3,086 schools; next, 259 congregations of women and 644 communities\r\nwhich possess 3,196 establishments, supplying 16,478 schools and\r\ncounting 113,750 members. In the second group, comprising unauthorized\r\nsocieties, we find 384 establishments of men with 7,444 members, and 602\r\nestablishments of women with 14,003 members,--in all, in both groups,\r\n30,287 brethren and 127,753 sisters. Considering the total population,\r\nthe proportion of brethren in 1789 and in our day is about the same;\r\nit is their spirit which has changed; at the present day, all desire to\r\nremain in their profession, while in 1789 two-thirds wanted to withdraw\r\nfrom it. As to the proportion of Sisters, it has increased beyond all\r\ncalculation.[5312] Out of 10,000 women in the population, there were, in\r\n1789, 28 Sisters; in 1866, 45; in 1878, 67.[5313]\r\n\r\nCarmelites, Clarisses, Filles du Coeur de Jésus, Réparatrices, Soeurs du\r\nSaint-Sacrament, Visitandines, Franciscaines, Benedictines and others\r\nlike these, about 4000 nuns or sisters, are contemplatists. The\r\nCarthusians, Cistercians, Trappists, and some others, about 1800 monks\r\nand brethren who, for the most part, till the ground, do not impose\r\nlabor on themselves other than as an accessory exercise; their first and\r\nprincipal object is prayer, meditation and worship; they, too, devote\r\ntheir lives to contemplation on the other world and not to the service\r\nof this one. But all the others, more than 28,000 men and more than\r\n123,000 women, are benefactors by institution and voluntary laborers,\r\nchoosing to devote themselves to dangerous, revolting, and at least\r\nungrateful services--missions among savages and barbarians, care of the\r\nsick, of idiots, of the insane, of the infirm, of the incurable, the\r\nsupport of poor old men or of abandoned children; countless charitable\r\nand educational works, primary schools, orphan asylums, houses of refuge\r\nand prisons, and all gratuitously or at the lowest wages through a\r\nreduction of bodily necessities to the lowest point, and of the personal\r\nexpenditure of each brother or sister.[5314] Evidently, with these\r\nmen and with these women, the ordinary balance of motives which prompt\r\npeople is reversed; in the inward balance of the scale it is no longer\r\nselfishness which prevails against altruism, but the love of others\r\nwhich prevails against selfishness.--Let us look at one of their\r\ninstitutions just at the moment of its formation and see how the\r\npreponderance passes over from the egoistic to the social instinct.\r\nThe first thing we always find at the origin of the enterprise is\r\ncompassion; a few kind hearts have been moved at the aspect of misery,\r\ndegradation and misconduct; souls or bodies were in distress and there\r\nwas danger of shipwreck; three or four saviors have come to the rescue.\r\nAt Rouen, in 1818, it is a poor girl who, by advice of her curé, brings\r\ntogether a few of her friends in her garret; during the day they study\r\nin a class and at night they work for their living; today, under the\r\ntitle of \"Soeurs du Sacré-Coeur de Jésus,\" they number 800. Elsewhere, at\r\nLaval, the founder of the House of Refuge for poor repentants is a\r\nplain ironing-girl who began her \"House\" by charitably harboring two\r\nprostitutes; these brought others, and there are now a hundred of\r\nsimilar institutions. Most frequently, the founder is the desservant or\r\nvicar of the place, who, moved by local misery, fancies at first that\r\nhe is doing only local work. Thus, there is born in 1806 at\r\nRouissé-sur-Loire the congregation of \"La Providence,\" which now has 918\r\n\"Sisters,\" in 193 houses; in 1817, at Lovallat, the association of \"Les\r\nPetits-Frères de Marie,\" which numbers to-day 3600 brethren; in 1840,\r\nat Saint-Servan, the institution of \"Les Petites-Soeurs des Pauvres,\" who\r\nnow number 2685, and, with no other help but alms-giving, feed and care\r\nfor, in their 158 houses, 20,000 old men, of which 13,000 live in their\r\n93 domiciles in France; they take their meals after the inmates, and eat\r\nonly what they leave; they are prohibited from accepting any endowment\r\nwhatever; by virtue of their rules they are and remain mendicants, at\r\nfirst, and especially, in behalf of their old men, and afterwards and\r\nas accessory, in their own behalf. Note the circumstances of the\r\nundertaking and the condition of the founders--they were two village\r\nwork-women, young girls between sixteen and eighteen for whom the vicar\r\nof the parish had written short regulations (une petite règle); on\r\nSunday, together in the cleft of a rock on the seaside, they studied\r\nand meditated over this little summary manual, performed the prescribed\r\ndevotions, this or that prayer or orison at certain hours, saying their\r\nbeads, the station in the church, self-examination and other ceremonies\r\nof which the daily repetition deposits and strengthens the supernatural\r\nmental conception. Such, over and above natural pity, is the superadded\r\nweight which fixes the unstable will and maintains the soul permanently\r\nin a state of abnegation.--At Paris, in the two halls of the Prefecture\r\nof Police, where prostitutes and female thieves remain for a day or two\r\nin provisional confinement, the \"Sisters\" of \"Marie-Joseph,\" obliged by\r\ntheir vows to live constantly in this sewer always full of human dregs,\r\nsometimes feel their heart failing them; fortunately, a little chapel is\r\narranged for them in one corner where they retire to pray, and in a few\r\nminutes they return with their store of courage and gentleness again\r\nrevived.--Father Etienne, superior of the \"Lazarists\" and of the\r\n\"Filles de Saint-Vincent de Paule,\" with the authority of long\r\nexperience, very justly observed to some foreign visitors,[5315] \"I have\r\ngiven you the details of our life, but I have not told you the secret\r\nof it. This secret, here it is--it is Jesus Christ, known, loved, and\r\nserved in the Eucharist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Evolution of the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n     The mystic faculty.--Its sources and works.--Evangelical\r\n     Christianity.--Its moral object and social effect.--Roman\r\n     Christianity.--Development of the Christian idea in the\r\n     West.--Influence of the Roman language and law.--Roman\r\n     conception of the State.--Roman conception of the Church.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, to the communicant on his knees about\r\nto receive the sacrament, the Host often faded out of sight; it\r\ndisappeared, and, in its place, appeared an infant or the radiant\r\nfeatures of the Savior and, according to the Church doctors, this was\r\nnot an illusion but an illumination.[5316] The veil had lifted, and the\r\nsoul found itself face to face with its object, Jesus Christ present in\r\nEucharist. This was second sight, infinitely superior in certainty and\r\nreach to the former, a direct, full view granted by grace from above,\r\na supernatural view.--By this example, which is an extreme case, we\r\ncomprehend in what faith consists. It is an extraordinary faculty\r\noperating alongside of and often in conjunction with our natural\r\nfaculties; over and above things as our observation naturally presents\r\nthem to us, it reveals to us a beyond, a majestic, grandiose world, the\r\nonly one truly real and of which ours is but the temporary veil. In the\r\ndepths of the soul, much below the superficial crust of which we have\r\nany conscience,[5317] impressions have accumulated like subterranean\r\nwaters. There, under the surging heat of innate instincts, a living\r\nspring has burst forth, growing and bubbling in the obscurity; let a\r\nshock or a fissure intervene and it suddenly sprouts up and forces its\r\nway above the surface; the man who has this within him and in whom it\r\noverflows is amazed at the inundation and no longer recognizes himself;\r\nthe visible field of his conscience is completely changed and renewed;\r\nin place of his former and vacillating and scattered thoughts he finds\r\nan irresistible and coherent belief, a precise conception, and intense\r\npicture, a passionate affirmation, sometimes even positive perceptions\r\nof a species apart and which come to him not from without but from\r\nwithin, not alone mere mental suggestions, like the dialogues of\r\nthe \"Imitation\" and the \"intellectual locutions\" of the mystics, but\r\nveritable physical sensations like the details of the visions of Saint\r\nTheresa, the articulate voices of Joan of Arc and the bodily stigmata of\r\nSaint Francis.\r\n\r\nIn the first century, this beyond discovered by the mystic faculty was\r\nthe kingdom of God, opposed to the kingdoms of this world;[5318] these\r\nkingdoms, in the eyes of those who revealed them, were worthless;\r\nthrough the keen insight of the moral and social instinct, these large,\r\ngenerous and simple hearts had divined the internal defect of all the\r\nsocieties or States of the century. Egoism in these was too great;\r\nthere was in them a lack of charity,[5319] the faculty of loving another\r\nequally with one's self, and thus of loving, not only a few, but all\r\nmen, whoever they might be, simply because they were men, and especially\r\nthe meek, the humble and the poor; in other words, the voluntary\r\nrepression of the appetites by which the individual makes of himself a\r\ncenter and subordinates other lives to himself, the renunciation of \"the\r\nlusts of the flesh, of the eyes and of vanity, the insolence of wealth\r\nand luxury, of force and of power.\"[5320]--Opposed to and in contrast\r\nwith this human order of things, the idea of a divine order of things\r\nwas born and developed itself--a Heavenly Father, his reign in heaven,\r\nand very soon, perhaps on the morrow, his reign here below; his son\r\ndescending to the earth to establish his reign and dying on the cross\r\nfor the salvation of men; after him, his Spirits, sent by him, the\r\ninward breath which animates his disciples and continues his work; all\r\nmen brethren and beloved children of the same common father; here and\r\nthere spontaneous groups who have learned \"these good tidings\"\r\nand propagated them; small scattered communities which live in the\r\nexpectation of an ideal order of things and yet, by anticipation,\r\nrealizing it from this time forth; \"All[5321] were of one heart and one\r\nsoul,... for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them,\r\nand brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them\r\ndown at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man\r\naccording as he had need,\" all happy in being together, in mutual love\r\nand in feeling themselves regenerate or pure.\r\n\r\nHere is to be found in the soul a new regulator and motor, and moreover\r\na powerful organ, appropriate and effective, obtained through internal\r\nrecasting and metamorphosis, like the wings with which an insect is\r\nprovided after its transformation. In every living organism, necessity,\r\nthrough tentative effort and selections, thus produces the possible and\r\nrequisite organ. In India, five hundred years before our era, it was\r\nBuddhism; in Arabia, six hundred years after our era, it was Islam;\r\nin our western societies it is Christianity. At the present day, after\r\neighteen centuries on both continents, from the Ural to the Rocky\r\nMountains, amongst Russian moujiks and American settlers, it works as\r\nformerly with the fishermen of Galilee and in the same way, in such a\r\nway as to substitute for the love of self the love of others; neither\r\nin substance nor in use has any change taken place; under its Greek,\r\nCatholic or Protestant envelope, it is still, for four hundred millions\r\nof human beings, the spiritual means, the great, indispensable pair\r\nof wings by which man rises upward above himself, above his groveling\r\nexistence and his limited horizons, leading him on through patience,\r\nhope and resignation to serenity, and beyond to temperance, purity,\r\ngoodness, and self-devotion and self-sacrifice. Always and everywhere,\r\nfor the past eighteen hundred years, as soon as these wings grow feeble\r\nor give way, public and private morals degenerate. In Italy, during\r\nthe Renaissance, in England under the restoration, in France under the\r\nConvention and Directory, man becomes as pagan as in the first century;\r\nthe same causes render him the same as in the times of Augustus and\r\nTiberius, that is to say voluptuous and cruel: he abuses himself and\r\nvictimizes others; a brutal, calculating egoism resumes its ascendancy,\r\ndepravity and sensuality spread, and society becomes a den of\r\ncut-throats and a brothel.[5322]\r\n\r\nAfter contemplating this spectacle near by, we can value the\r\ncontribution to modern societies of Christianity, how much modesty,\r\ngentleness and humanity it has introduced into them, how it maintains\r\nintegrity, good faith and justice. Neither philosophic reason, artistic\r\nor literary culture, or even feudal, military or chivalric honor, nor\r\nany administration or government can replace it. There is nothing else\r\nto restrain our natal bent, nothing to arrest the insensible, steady,\r\ndown-hill course of our species with the whole of its original burden,\r\never retrograding towards the abyss. Whatever its present envelope may\r\nbe, the old Gospel still serves as the best auxiliary of the social\r\ninstinct.\r\n\r\nAmong its three contemporary forms, that which groups together the most\r\nmen, about 180 millions of believers, is Catholicism, in other words,\r\nRoman Christianity, which two words, comprising a definition, contain\r\na history. At the origin, on the birth of the Christian principle, it\r\nexpressed itself at first in Hebrew, the language of prophets and\r\nof seers; afterwards, and very soon, in Greek, the language of the\r\ndialecticians and philosophers; at last, and very late, in Latin, the\r\nlanguage of the jurisconsults and statesmen; then come the successive\r\nstages of dogma. All the evangelical and apostolic texts, written in\r\nGreek, all the metaphysical speculations,[5323] also in Greek, which\r\nserved as commentary on these, reached the western Latins only\r\nthrough translations. Now, in metaphysics, Latin poorly translates the\r\nGreek[5324]; it lacks both the terms and the ideas; what the Orient\r\nsays, the Occident only half comprehends; it accepts this without\r\ndispute and confidently holds it as truth.[5325] At length in its turn,\r\nin the fourth century, when, after Theodosius, the Occident breaks loose\r\nfrom the Orient, it intervenes, and it intervenes with its language,\r\nthat is to say with the provision of ideas and words which its culture\r\nprovided; it likewise had its instruments of precision, not those of\r\nPlato and Aristotle, but others, as special, forged by Ulpian, Gaius\r\nand twenty generations of jurists through the original invention and\r\nimmemorial labor of Roman genius. \"To say what is law,\" to impose rules\r\nof conduct on men, is, in abridged form, the entire practical work of\r\nthe Roman people; to write this law out, to formulate and coordinate\r\nthese rules, is, in abridged form, its entire scientific work, and\r\nwith the Romans in the third, fourth and fifth centuries, during the\r\ndecadence of other studies, the science of law was still in full\r\nforce and vigor.[5326] Hence, when the Occidentals undertook the\r\ninterpretation of texts and the elaboration of the Creed it was with\r\nthe habits and faculties of jurisconsults, with the preoccupations and\r\nmental reservations of statesmen, with the mental and verbal instruments\r\nwhich they found suitable. In those days, the Greek doctors, in conflict\r\nwith the monophysites and monothelites, brought out the theory of\r\nthe divine essence; at the same date, the Latin doctors, opposing the\r\nPelagians, Semi-Pelagians and Donatists, founded the theory of human\r\nobligation.[5327] Obligation, said the Roman jurists, is a lien of law\"\r\nby which we are held to doing or suffering something to free us from\r\nindebtedness. Out of this juridical conception, which is a masterpiece\r\nof Roman jurisprudence, issued, as with a bud full of sap, the new\r\ndevelopment of the Creed.--On the one hand, we are obligated towards\r\nGod, for, in relation to him, we are, in legal terms, insolvent debtors,\r\nheirs of an infinite debt, incapable of paying it and of satisfying\r\nour creditor except through the interpostion of a superhuman third\r\nperson[5328] who assumes our indebtedness as his own; still more\r\nprecisely, we are delinquents, guilty from birth and by inheritance,\r\ncondemned en masse and then pardoned en masse, but in such a way that\r\nthis pardon, a pure favor, not warranted by any merit of our own, always\r\nremains continual and revocable at will; that, for a few only, it is\r\nor becomes plenary and lasting, that no one amongst us can be sure of\r\nobtaining it, and that its award, determined beforehand on high, forever\r\nremains for us a State secret. Hence the prolonged controversies\r\non Predestination, Free-will and Original Sin, and the profound\r\ninvestigations on man before, during and after the Fall. Hence, also,\r\nthe accepted solutions, not very conclusive and, if one pleases,\r\ncontradictory, but practical, average and well calculated for\r\nmaintaining mankind in faith and obedience, under the ecclesiastical and\r\ndogmatic government which, alone, is authorized to lead man on in the\r\nway of salvation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we are obligated to the Church, for she is a cité,\r\nthe city of God, and, following the Roman definition, the cité is not an\r\nabstract term, a collective term, but a real, positive existence,\r\n\"the commonwealth\" (chose publique), that is to say a distinct entity\r\nconsisting of generations which succeed each other in it, of infinite\r\nduration and of a superior kind, divine or nearly so, which does not\r\nbelong to individuals but to which they belong, an organized body, with\r\nspecial form and structure, based on traditions, constituted by laws and\r\nruled by a government. The absolute authority of the community over its\r\nmembers and the despotic leadership of the community by its chiefs--such\r\nis the Roman notion of the State and, for much stronger reasons, of\r\nthe Church. She, thus, is a militant, conquering, governing Rome,\r\npredestined to universal empire, a legitimate sovereign like the other\r\none, but with a better title, for she derives hers from God. It is God\r\nwho, from the beginning, has preconceived and prepared her, who has\r\nbodied her forth in the Old Testament and announced her through the\r\nprophets; it is the Son of God who has built her up, who, to all\r\neternity, will never fail to maintain and guide her steps, who, through\r\nhis constant inspiration, ever remains present in her and active through\r\nher. He has committed to her his revelation. She alone, expressly\r\ndelegated by Christ, possesses second sight, the knowledge of the\r\ninvisible, the comprehension of the ideal order of things as its Founder\r\nprescribed and instituted, and hence, accordingly, the custodianship\r\nand interpretation of the Scriptures, the right of framing dogmas and\r\ninjunctions, of teaching and commanding, of reigning over souls and\r\nintellects, of fashioning belief and morals. Henceforth, the mystic\r\nfaculty is to be confined within dikes. At bottom, this is the faculty\r\nfor conceiving of the ideal, to obtain a vision of it, to have faith in\r\nthis vision and to act upon it; the more precious it is the greater the\r\nnecessity of its being under control. To preserve it from itself, to\r\nput it on guard against the arbitrariness and diversity of individual\r\nopinions, to prevent unrestrained digression, theoretically or\r\npractically, either on the side of laxity or of rigor, requires a\r\ngovernment.--That this is a legacy of ancient Rome the Catholic Church\r\ndoes not dispute. She styles herself the Roman Church. She still writes\r\nand prays in Latin. Rome is always her capital; the title of her chief\r\nis that which formerly designated the head of the pagan cult; after 1378\r\nall the Popes except five, and since 1523 all, have been Italians; at\r\nthe present day, thirty-five out of sixty-four cardinals are likewise\r\nItalians. The Roman stamp becomes still more evident on comparing the\r\nmillions of Christians who are Catholics with the millions of Christians\r\nwho are not. Among the primitive annexations and ulterior acquisitions\r\nof the Roman Church, several have separated from her, those of the\r\ncountries whose Greek, Slavic and Germanic populations never spoke Latin\r\nand whose language is not derived from the Latin. Poland and Ireland\r\nare alone, or nearly so, the only countries which have remained loyal,\r\nbecause, with these, the Catholic faith, under the long pressure of\r\npublic calamities, has become incorporated with national sentiment.\r\nElsewhere the Roman deposit is non-existent or too thin. On the\r\ncontrary, all the populations that were once Latinized have at bottom\r\nremained Catholic; four centuries of imperial rule and of Roman\r\nassimilation have deposited in them of layers of habits, ideas and\r\nsentiments which endure.[5329] To measure the influence of this historic\r\nlayer it is sufficient to note that three elements compose it, all three\r\ncontemporary, of the same origin and of the same thickness, a Roman\r\nlanguage, the civil law of Rome, and Roman Christianity; each of these\r\nelements, through its consistence, indicates the consistence of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nHence the profound and established characteristics by which the Catholic\r\nbranch now distinguishes itself from the other two issuing from the same\r\nChristian trunk. With the Protestants, the Bible, which is the Word\r\nof God, is the sole spiritual authority; all the others, the Doctors,\r\nFathers, tradition, Popes and Councils, are human and, accordingly,\r\nfallible; in fact, these have repeatedly and gravely erred.[5330] The\r\nBible, however, is a text which each reader reads with his own eyes,\r\nmore or less enlightened and sensitive, with eyes which, in Luther's\r\ntime, possessed the light and sensibility of the sixteenth century, and\r\nwhich, at the present time, read with the sensibility and light of\r\nthe nineteenth century; so that, according to epochs and groups, the\r\ninterpretation may vary, while authority, if not as regards the text, or\r\nat least its meaning, belongs wholly to the individual. With the Greeks\r\nand Slavs, as with the Catholics, it belongs only to the Church, that is\r\nto say to the heads of the Church, the successors of the apostles.\r\nBut with the Greeks and Slavs, since the ninth century, the Church had\r\ndecreed no new dogmas; according to her, revelation had stopped; the\r\ncreed was finished, final and complete, and there was nothing to do but\r\nto maintain it.--On the contrary, with the Catholics, after as before\r\nthat date, the creed never ceased developing itself, always becoming\r\nmore precise, and revelation kept on; the last thirteen councils were\r\ninspired like the first seven, while the first one, in which Saint Peter\r\nat Jerusalem figured, enjoyed no more prerogatives than the last\r\none convoked by Pius IX. at the Vatican. The Church is not \"a frozen\r\ncorpse,\"[5331] but a living body, led by an always active brain which\r\npursues its work not only in this world but likewise in the next world,\r\nat first to define it and next to describe it and assign places in\r\nit; only yesterday she added two articles of faith to the creed, the\r\nimmaculate conception of the Virgin and the infallibility of the Pope;\r\nshe conferred ultra-terrestrial titles; she declared Saint Joseph patron\r\nof the universal Church; she canonized Saint Labre; she elevated Saint\r\nFrançois de Sales to the rank of Doctor. But she is as conservative as\r\nshe is active. She retracts nothing of her past, never rescinding any\r\nof her ancient decrees; only, with the explanations, commentaries and\r\ndeductions of the jurist, she fastens these links closer together, forms\r\nan uninterrupted chain of them extending from the present time back to\r\nthe New Testament and, beyond, through the Old Testament, to the origins\r\nof the world, in such a way as to coordinate around herself the entire\r\nuniverse and all history. Revelations and prescriptions, the doctrine\r\nthus built up is a colossal work, as comprehensive as it is precise,\r\nanalogous to the Digest but much more vast; for, besides canon law and\r\nmoral theology, she includes dogmatic theology, that is to say, besides\r\nthe theory of the visible world, the theory of the invisible world\r\nand its three regions, the geography of Hell, Purgatory and Paradise,\r\nimmense territories of which our earth is merely the vestibule, unknown\r\nterritories inaccessible to sense and reason, but whose confines,\r\nentrances, issues and subdivisions, the inhabitants and all that\r\nconcerns them, their faculties and their communications, are defined, as\r\non Peutinger's map and in the Notitia imperii romani, with extraordinary\r\nclearness, minutia and exactitude, through a combination of the\r\npositive spirit and the mystic spirit and by theologians who are at once\r\nChristians and administrators. In this relation, examine the \"Somme\"\r\nof Saint Thomas. Still at the present day his order, the Dominican,\r\nfurnishes at Rome those who are consulted on matters of dogma; or\r\nrather, in order to abridge and transcribe scholastic formula into\r\nperceptible images, read the \"Divine Comedy \"by Dante.[5332] It is\r\nprobable that this description, as far as imagination goes, is still\r\nto-day the most exact as well as most highly-colored presentation of\r\nthe human and divine world as the Catholic Church conceives it. She has\r\ncharge of its keys and reigns and governs in it. The prestige of such\r\na government over multitudes of minds and souls, susceptible to\r\ndiscipline, without personal initiative, and in need of firm and\r\nsystematic guidance, is supreme. It is equal to or superior to that of\r\nthe ancient roman State with its 120 million subjects. Outside of\r\nthe Empire all seemed to these souls anarchy or barbarism; the same\r\nimpression exists with the Catholics in relation to their Church.\r\nWhether spiritual or temporal, an authority is more likely to be\r\napproved and venerated when, always visible and everywhere present, it\r\nis neither arbitrary nor capricious, but orderly, restrained by texts,\r\ntraditions, legislation and jurisprudence, derived from above and from\r\na superhuman source, consecrated by antiquity and by the continuity,\r\ncoherence and grandeur of its work, in short, by that character which\r\nthe Latin tongue is alone capable of expressing and which it terms\r\nmajesty.\r\n\r\nAmong the acts which religious authority prescribes to its subjects,\r\nthere are some which it imposes in its own name--rites, outward\r\nceremonies and other observances--of which the principal ones, in the\r\nCatholic catechism, form a sequence to the \"commandments of God,\"\r\nand which are entitled the \"commandments of the Church.\"--With the\r\nProtestants, where Church authority is almost gone, rites have almost\r\ndisappeared; considered in themselves, they have ceased to be regarded\r\nas obligatory or meritorious; the most important ones, the Eucharist\r\nitself, have been retained only as commemorative or as symbolic; the\r\nrest, fasts, abstinences, pilgrimages, the worship of saints and the\r\nVirgin, relics of the cross, words committed to memory, genuflections\r\nand kneeling before images or altars, have been pronounced vain; in the\r\nway of positive injunctions none remain but the reading of the Bible,\r\nwhile duty in outward demonstration of piety is reduced to piety\r\nwithin, to the moral virtues, to truthfulness, probity, temperance and\r\nsteadfastness, to the energetic determination to observe the watchword\r\nreceived by man in two forms and which he finds in two concordant\r\nexamples, in the Scriptures as interpreted by his conscience, and in his\r\nconscience as enlightened by the Scriptures. As another consequence,\r\nthe Protestant priest has ceased to be a delegate from on high, the\r\nindispensable mediator between man and God, alone qualified to give\r\nabsolution and to administer the rites by which salvation is obtained;\r\nhe is simply a man, graver, more learned, more pious and more exemplary\r\nthan other men, but, like the others, married, father of a family and\r\nentering into civil life, in short a semi-layman. The laymen whom\r\nhe leads owe him deference, not obedience; he issues no orders; he\r\nsentences nobody; speaking from the rostrum to a gathering is his\r\nprincipal, almost unique, office, and the sole purpose of this is\r\ninstruction or an exhortation.--With the Greeks and Slaves, with whom\r\nthe authority of the Church is merely of a preservative nature, all\r\nthe observances of the twelfth century have subsisted, as rigorously in\r\nRussia as in Asia Minor or in Greece, although fasting and Lents, which\r\nSouthern stomachs can put up with, are unhealthy for the temperaments\r\nof the North. Here, likewise, these observances have assumed capital\r\nimportance. The active sap, withdrawn from theology and the clergy,\r\nflows nowhere else; these, in an almost paralyzed religion, constitute\r\nalmost the sole vivifying organ, as vigorous and often more so,\r\nthan ecclesiastical authority; in the seventeenth century, under the\r\npatriarch Nicon, thousands of \"old believers,\" on account of slight\r\nrectifications of the liturgy, the alteration of a letter in the Russian\r\ntranslation of the name of Jesus, and the sign of the cross made by\r\nthree instead of two fingers, separated themselves and, to-day, these\r\ndissenters, multiplied by their sects, count by millions. Defined by\r\ncustom, every rite is sacred, immutable, and, when exactly fulfilled,\r\nsufficient in itself and efficacious; the priest who utters the words\r\nand makes the motions is only one piece in the mechanism, one of\r\nthe instruments requisite for a magic incantation; after his\r\ninstrumentation, he falls back into his human negativity; he is nothing\r\nmore than an employee paid for his ministration. And this ministration\r\nis not exalted in him by an extraordinary and visible renunciation,\r\nby perpetual celibacy, by continence promised and kept; he is\r\nmarried,[5333] father of a family, needy, obliged to shear his flock to\r\nsupport himself and those belonging to him, and therefore is of little\r\nconsideration; he is without moral ascendancy; he is not the pastor who\r\nis obeyed, but the official who is made use of.\r\n\r\nThe role of the priest in the Catholic Church is quite different.\r\nThrough her theory of rites she confers on him incomparable dignity\r\nand real personal power.--According to this theory, observances and\r\nceremonies possess intrinsic and peculiar virtue; undoubtedly, these\r\nrequire some mental base, which is found in earnest piety; but\r\nearnest piety independent of these is not enough; it lacks its final\r\nconsequence, its praiseworthy completion or \"satisfaction,\"[5334] the\r\npositive act by which we atone for our sins to God and demonstrate our\r\nobedience to the Church.[5335] It is the Church, the living interpreter\r\nof God's will, which prescribes these rites; she is then the mistress of\r\nthese and not the servant; she is empowered to adapt their details and\r\nforms to necessities and circumstances, to lighten or simplify them\r\naccording to time and place, to establish the communion in one shape, to\r\nsubstitute the Host in place of bread, to lessen the number and rigor of\r\nthe ancient Lents, to determine the effects of diverse pious works, to\r\napply, ascribe and transfer their salutary effects, to assign proper\r\nvalue and reward to each devotional act, to measure the merit derived\r\nfrom them, the sins they efface and the pardons these obtain not only in\r\nthis world but in the next one. By virtue of her administrative habits,\r\nand with the precision of a bookkeeper, she casts up her accounts\r\nof indulgences and notes on the margin the conditions for obtaining\r\nthem,--a certain prayer repeated so many times on certain days and\r\nwhat for, so many days less in the great penitentiary into which every\r\nChristian, however pious, is almost sure to get on dying, this or that\r\ndiminution of the penalty incurred, and the faculty, if the penitent\r\nrejects this deduction for himself, of bestowing the benefit on another.\r\nBy virtue of her authoritative habits and the better to affirm her\r\nsovereignty, she regards as capital sins the omission of the rites\r\nand ceremonies she commands,--\"not going to mass on Sunday or on\r\nfête-days;[5336] eating meat on Friday or Saturday unnecessarily;\" not\r\nconfessing and communing at Easter, a mortal sin which \"deprives one of\r\nthe grace of God and merits eternal punishment\" as well as \"to slay\r\nand to steal something of value.\" For all these crimes, unforgivable in\r\nthemselves, there is but one pardon, the absolution given by the\r\npriest, that is to say, confession beforehand, itself being one of the\r\nobservances to which we are bound by strict obligation and at the very\r\nleast once a year.\r\n\r\nThrough this office the Catholic priest rises above human conditions to\r\nan immeasurable height; for, in the confessional, he exercises\r\nsupreme power, that which God is to exercise at the Last Judgment,\r\nthe formidable power of punishing or remitting sins, of judgment or\r\nof absolution, and, if he intervenes on the death-bed, the faculty of\r\nconsigning the impenitent or repentant soul to an eternity of rewards\r\nor to an eternity of damnation.[5337] No creature, terrestrial or\r\ncelestial, not even the highest of archangels, or St. Joseph or the\r\nVirgin,[5338] possesses this veritably divine prerogative. He alone\r\nholds it through exclusive delegation, by virtue of a special sacrament,\r\nthe order which assigns to him the privilege of conferring five others,\r\nand which endows him for life with a character apart, ineffaceable and\r\nsupernatural.--To render himself worthy of it, he has taken a vow of\r\nchastity, he undertakes to root out from his flesh and his heart the\r\nconsequences of sex; he debars himself from marriage and paternity;\r\nthrough isolation, he escapes all family influences, curiosities and\r\nindiscretions; he belongs wholly to his office. He has prepared himself\r\nfor it long beforehand, he has studied moral theology together with\r\ncasuistry and become a criminal jurist; and his sentence is not a vague\r\npardon bestowed on penitents after having admitted in general terms that\r\nthey are sinners. He is bound to weigh the gravity of their errors and\r\nthe strength of their repentance, to know the facts and details of\r\nthe fall and the number of relapses, the aggravating or extenuating\r\ncircumstances, and, therefore, to interrogate in order to sound the soul\r\nto its depths. If some souls are timorous, they surrender themselves to\r\nhim spontaneously and, more than this, they have recourse to him outside\r\nof his tribunal; he marks out for them the path they must follow, he\r\nguides them at every turn; he interferes daily, he becomes a director as\r\nwas said in the seventeenth century, the titular and permanent director\r\nof one or of many lives.[5339] This is still the case at the present\r\nday, and especially for women and for all nuns; the central conception\r\naround which all Roman ideas turn, the conception of the imperium and\r\nof government, has here found its perfect accomplishment and attained to\r\nits final outermost limits.\r\n\r\nThere are now of these spiritual governors about 180,000, installed in\r\nthe five regions of the world, each assigned to the leadership of about\r\n1000 souls and as special guardian of a distinct flock, all ordained by\r\nbishops instituted by the Pope, he being absolute monarch and declared\r\nsuch by the latest council. In the new Rome as in the ancient Rome,\r\nauthority has gradually become concentrated until it has centered in\r\nand is entrusted wholly to the hands of one man. Romulus, the Alban\r\nshepherd, was succeeded by Cæsar Augustus, Constantine or Theodosius,\r\nwhose official title was \"Your Eternal,\" \"Your Divine,\" and who\r\npronounced their decrees \"immutable oracles.\" Peter, the fisherman of\r\nGalilee, was succeeded by infallible pontiffs whose official title is\r\n\"Your Holiness,\" and whose decrees, for every Catholic, are \"immutable\r\noracles\" in fact as in law, not hyperbolically, but in the full sense\r\nof the words expressed by exact terms. The imperial institution has thus\r\nformed itself anew; it has simply transferred itself from one domain\r\nto another; only, in passing from the temporal order of things to the\r\nspiritual order, it has become firmer and stronger, for it has guarded\r\nagainst two defects which weakened its antique model.--One the one hand,\r\nit has provided for the transmission of supreme power; in old Rome, they\r\ndid not know how to regulate this; hence, when an interregnum occurred,\r\nthe many violent competitors, the fierce conflicts, the brutalities,\r\nall the usurpations of force, all the calamities of anarchy. In Catholic\r\nRome, the election of the sovereign pontiff belongs definitively to a\r\ncollege of prelates[5340] who vote according to established formalities;\r\nthese elect the new pope by a majority of two-thirds, and, for more than\r\nfour centuries, not one of these elections has been contested; between\r\neach defunct pope and his elected successor, the transfer of universal\r\nobedience has been prompt and unhesitating and, during as after the\r\ninterregnum, no schism in the Church has occurred.--On the other hand,\r\nin the legal title of Cæsar Augustus there was a defect. According to\r\nRoman law, he was only the representative of the people; the community\r\nhad delegated all its rights incorporate to him; but in it alone was\r\nomnipotence vested. According to canon law, omnipotence was vested\r\nsolely in God; it is not the Catholic community which possesses this and\r\ndelegates it to the Pope;[5341] his rights accrue to him from another\r\nand higher source.[5342] He is not the elect of the people, but the\r\ninterpreter, vicar and representative of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The Church today.\r\n\r\n     Existing Catholicism and its distinctive traits.--Authority,\r\n     its prestige and supports.--Rites, the priest, the Pope.\r\n     --The Catholic Church and the modern State.--Difficulties in\r\n     France born out of their respective constitutions.--\r\n\r\nSuch is the Catholic Church of to-day, a State constructed after the\r\ntype of the old Roman empire, independent and autonomous, monarchical\r\nand centralized, with a domain not of territory but of souls and\r\ntherefore international, under an absolute and cosmopolite sovereign\r\nwhose subjects are simultaneously subjects of other non-religious\r\nrulers. Hence, for the Catholic Church a situation apart in every\r\ncountry, more difficult than for Greek, Slavic or Protestant churches;\r\nthese difficulties vary in each country according to the character of\r\nthe State and with the form which the Catholic Church has received in\r\nthem.[5343] In France, since the Concordat, these difficulties are of\r\ngreater gravity than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1802, the Church initially received her French form, this was\r\na complete systematic organization, after a general and regular plan,\r\naccording to which she formed only one compartment of the whole.\r\nNapoleon, by his Concordat, organic articles and ulterior decrees,\r\nin conformity with the ideas of the century and the principles of the\r\nConstituent Assembly, desired to render the clergy of all kinds,\r\nand especially the Catholic clergy, one of the subdivisions of his\r\nadministrative staff, a corps of functionaries, mere agents assigned\r\nto religious interests as formerly to civil matters and therefore\r\nmanageable and revocable. This they all were, in fact, including the\r\nbishops, since they at once tendered their resignations at his\r\norder. Still, at the present day all, except the bishops, are in\r\nthis situation, having lost the ownership of their places and the\r\nindependence of their lives, through the maintenance of the consular and\r\nimperial institutions, through removal, through the destruction of\r\nthe canonical and civil guarantees which formerly protected the\r\nlower clergy, through the suppression of the officialité; through the\r\nreduction of chapters to the state of vague shadows, through the rupture\r\nor laxity of the local and moral tie which once attached every member of\r\nthe clergy to a piece of land, to an organized body, to a territory, to\r\na flock, and through the lack of ecclesiastical endowment, through the\r\nreduction of every ecclesiastic, even a dignitary, to the humble and\r\nprecarious condition of a salaried dependent.[5344]\r\n\r\nA régime of this kind institutes in the body subject to it an almost\r\nuniversal dependence, and hence entire submission, passive obedience,\r\nand the stooping, prostrate attitude of the individual no longer able to\r\nstand upright on his own feet.[5345] The clergy to which it is applied\r\ncannot fail to be managed from above, which is the case with this\r\none, through its bishops, the Pope's lieutenant-generals, who give the\r\ncountersign to all of them. Once instituted by the Pope, each bishop\r\nis the governor for life of a French province and all-powerful in\r\nhis circumscription we have seen to what height his moral and social\r\nauthority has risen, how he has exercised his command, how he has kept\r\nhis clergy under discipline and available, in what class of society he\r\nhas found his recruits, through what drill and what enthusiasm every\r\npriest, including himself, is now a practiced soldier and kept in check;\r\nhow this army of occupation, distributed in 90 regiments and composed\r\nof 50,000 resident priests, is completed by special bodies of troops\r\nsubject to still stricter discipline, by monastic corporations, by four\r\nor five thousand religious institutions, nearly all of them given to\r\nlabor and benevolence; how, to the subordination and correct deportment\r\nof the secular clergy is added the enthusiasm and zeal of the regular\r\nclergy, the entire devotion, the wonderful self-denial of 30,000 monks\r\nand of 120,000 nuns; how this vast body, animated by one spirit,\r\nmarches steadily along with all its lay supporters towards one end. This\r\npurpose, forever the same, is the maintenance of its dominion over all\r\nthe souls that it has won over, and the conquest of all the souls over\r\nwhich it has not yet established its domination.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more antipathetic to the French State. Built up like\r\nthe Church, after the Roman model, it is likewise authoritative and\r\nabsorbent. In the eyes of Napoleon, all these priests appointed or\r\nsanctioned by him, who have sworn allegiance to him, whom he pays\r\nannually or quarterly, belong to him in a double sense, first under the\r\ntitle of subjects, and next under the title of clerks. His successors\r\nare still inclined to regard them in the same light; in their hands the\r\nState is ever what he made it, that is to say a monopolizer, convinced\r\nthat its rights are illimitable and that its interference everywhere\r\nis legitimate, accustomed to governing all it can and leaving to\r\nindividuals only the smallest portion of themselves, hostile to all\r\nbodies that might interpose between them and it, distrustful and\r\nill-disposed towards all groups capable of collective action and\r\nspontaneous initiation, especially as concerns proprietary bodies.\r\nA self-constituted daily overseer, a legal guardian, a perpetual and\r\nminute director of moral societies as of local societies, usurper of\r\ntheir domains, undertaker or regulator of education and of charitable\r\nenterprises, the State is ever in inevitable conflict with the Church.\r\nThe latter, of all moral societies, is the most active; she does not let\r\nherself be enslaved like the others, her soul is in her own keeping;\r\nher faith, her organization, her hierarchy and her code are all her own.\r\nAgainst the rights of the State based on human reason, she claims rights\r\nfounded on divine revelation, and, in self-defense, she justly finds\r\nin the French clergy, as the State organized it in 1802, the best\r\ndisciplined militia, the best classified, the most capable of operating\r\ntogether under one countersign and of marching in military fashion under\r\nthe impulsion that its ecclesiastical leaders choose to give it.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the conflict is less permanent and less sharp the two\r\nconditions which aggravate it and maintain it in France are, one or\r\nboth, wanting. In other European countries, the Church has not the\r\nFrench form imposed upon it and the difficulties are less; in the\r\nUnited States of America, not only has it not undergone the French\r\ntransformation, but the State, liberal in principle, interdicts\r\nitself against interventions like those of the French State and the\r\ndifficulties are almost null. Evidently, if there was any desire to\r\nattenuate or to prevent the conflict it would be through the first\r\nor the last of these two policies. The French State, however,\r\ninstitutionally and traditionally, always invasive, is ever tempted to\r\ntake the contrary course.[5346]--At one time, as during the last years\r\nof the Restoration and the first years of the second Empire, it allies\r\nitself with the Church; each power helps the other in its domination,\r\nand in concert together they undertake to control the en tire man.\r\nIn this case, the two centralizations, one ecclesiastic and the other\r\nsecular, both increasing and prodigiously augmented for a century,\r\nwork together to overpower the individual. He is watched, followed up,\r\nseized, handled severely, and constrained even in his innermost being;\r\nhe can no longer breathe the atmosphere around him; we can well remember\r\nthe oppression which, after 1823 and after 1852, bore down on every\r\nindependent character and on every free intellect.--At another time, as\r\nunder the first and the third Republic, the State sees in the Church a\r\nrival and an adversary; consequently, it persecutes or worries it and we\r\nof to-day see with our own eyes how a governing minority, steadily,\r\nfor a long time, gives offence to a governed majority where it is\r\nmost sensitive; how it breaks up congregations of men and drives free\r\ncitizens from their homes whose only fault is a desire to live, pray\r\nand labor in common; how it expels nuns and monks from hospitals and\r\nschools, with what detriment to the hospital and to the sick, to the\r\nschool and to the children, and against what unwillingness and what\r\ndiscontent on the part of physicians and fathers of families, and at\r\nwhat bungling waste of public money, at what a gratuitous overburdening\r\nof taxation already too great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.

Already about\r\nthe middle of the preceding century, the discoveries of scientists,\r\ncoordinated by the philosophers, had afforded the sketch in full of\r\na great picture, still in course of execution and advancing towards\r\ncompletion, a picture of the physical and moral universe. In this sketch\r\nthe point of sight was fixed, the perspective designed, the various\r\ndistances marked out, the principal groups drawn, and its outlines were\r\nso correct that those who have since continued the work have little\r\nto add but to give precision to these and fill them up.[5347] In their\r\nhands, from Herschel and Laplace, from Volta, Cuvier, Ampère, Fresnel\r\nand Faraday to Darwin and Pasteur, Burnouf, Mommsen and Renan, the\r\nblanks on the canvas have been covered, the relief of the figures shown\r\nand new features added in the sense of the old ones, thus completing it\r\nwithout changing in any sense the expression of the whole, but, on the\r\ncontrary, in such a way as to consolidate, strengthen and perfect the\r\nmaster-conception which, purposely or not, had imposed itself on the\r\noriginal painters, all, predecessors and successors, working from\r\nnature and constantly inviting a comparison between the painting and\r\nthe model.--And, for one hundred years, this picture, so interesting, so\r\nmagnificent, and the accuracy of which is so well guaranteed, instead\r\nof being kept private and seen only by select visitors, as in the\r\neighteenth century, is publicly exposed and daily contemplated by an\r\never-increasing crowd. Through the practical application of the same\r\nscientific discoveries, owing to increased facilities for travel and\r\nintercommunication, to abundance of information, to the multitude\r\nand cheapness of books and newspapers, to the diffusion of primary\r\ninstruction, the number of visitors has increased enormously.[5348] Not\r\nonly has curiosity been aroused among the workmen in towns, but also\r\nwith the peasants formerly plodding along in the routine of their daily\r\nlabor, confined to their circle of six leagues in circumference. This or\r\nthat small daily journal treats of divine and human things for a million\r\nof subscribers and probably for three millions of readers.--Of\r\ncourse, out of a hundred visitors, ninety of them are not capable of\r\ncomprehending the sense of the picture; they give it only a cursory\r\nglance; moreover, their eyes are not properly educated for it, and they\r\nare unable to grasp masses and seize proportions. Their attention is\r\ngenerally arrested by a detail which they interpret in a wrong way, and\r\nthe mental image they carry away is merely a fragment or a caricature;\r\nbasically, if they have come to see a magisterial work, it is most of\r\nall due to vanity and so that his spectacle, which some of them enjoy,\r\nshould not remain the privileged of a few. Nevertheless, however\r\nimperfect and confused their impressions, however false and ill-founded\r\ntheir judgments, they have learned something important and one true idea\r\nof their visit remains with them: of the various pictures of the world\r\nnot one is painted by the imagination but from nature.[5349]\r\n\r\nNow, between this picture and that which the Catholic Church presents\r\nto them, the difference is enormous. Even with rude intellects, or minds\r\notherwise occupied, if the dissimilarity is not clearly perceived it\r\nis vaguely felt; in default of scientific notions, the simple hearsay\r\ncaught on the wing, and which seem to have flickered through the mind\r\nlike a flash of light over a hard rock, still subsists there in a latent\r\nstate, amalgamating and agglutinating into a solid block until at\r\nlength they form a massive, refractory sentiment utterly opposed to\r\nfaith.--With the Protestant, the opposition is neither extreme nor\r\ndefinitive. His faith, which the Scriptures give him for his guidance,\r\nleads him to read the Scriptures in the original text and, hence, to\r\nread with profit, to call to his aid whatever verifies and explains an\r\nancient text, linguistics, philology, criticism, psychology, combined\r\nwith general and particular history; thus does faith lay hold on science\r\nas an auxiliary. According to diverse souls, the role of the auxiliary\r\nis more or less ample it may accordingly adapt itself to the faculties\r\nand needs of each soul, and hence extend itself indefinitely, and\r\nalready do we see ahead the time when the two collaborators, enlightened\r\nfaith and respectful science, will together paint the same picture, or\r\neach separately paint the same picture twice in two different frames.--\r\nWith the Slavs and Greeks, faith, like the Church and the rite, is a\r\nnational thing; creed forms one body with the country, and there is less\r\ndisposition to dispute it; besides, it is not irksome; it is simply a\r\nhereditary relic, a domestic memorial, a family icon, a summary product\r\nof an exhausted art no longer well understood and which has ceased\r\nto produce. It is rather sketched out than completed, not one feature\r\nhaving been added to it since the tenth century; for eight hundred years\r\nthis picture has remained in one of the back chambers of the memory,\r\ncovered with cobwebs as ancient as itself, badly lighted and rarely\r\nvisited; everybody knows that it is there and it is spoken of with\r\nveneration; nobody would like to get rid of it, but it is not daily\r\nbefore the eyes so that it may be compared with the scientific\r\npicture.--Just the reverse with the Catholic picture. Each century, for\r\neight hundred years, has applied the brush to this picture; still, at\r\nthe present time we see it grow under our eyes, acquiring a stronger\r\nrelief, deeper color, a more vigorous harmony, an ever more fixed and\r\nstriking expression.--To the articles of belief which constitute the\r\ncreed for the Greek and Slavic church, thirteen subsequent Catholic\r\ncouncils have added to it many others, while the two principal dogmas\r\ndecreed by the last two councils, Transubstantiation by the council of\r\nTrent and the Infallibility of the Pope by that of the Vatican, are just\r\nthose the best calculated to hinder forever any reconciliation between\r\nscience and faith.\r\n\r\nThus, for Catholic nations, the dissimilarity, instead of diminishing,\r\nis aggravated; both pictures, one painted by faith and the other\r\nby science, become more and more dissimilar, while the profound\r\ncontradiction inherent in the two conceptions becomes glaring through\r\ntheir very development, each developing itself apart and both in\r\na counter-sense, one through dogmatic verdicts and through the\r\nstrengthening of discipline and the other by ever-increasing discoveries\r\nand by useful applications, each adding daily to its authority, one by\r\nprecious inventions and the other by good works, each being recognized\r\nfor what it is, one as the leading instructor of positive truths and the\r\nother as the leading instructor of sound morality. That is why we find a\r\ncombat in each Catholic breast as to which of the two concepts is to\r\nbe accepted as guide. To every sincere mind and to one capable of\r\nentertaining both, each is irreducible to the other. To the vulgar mind,\r\nunable to combine both in thought, they exist side by side and clash\r\nwith each other only occasionally when action demands a choice.\r\nMany intelligent, cultivated people, and even savants, especially\r\nspecialists, avoid confronting them, one being the support of their\r\nreason and the other the guardian of their conscience; between them, in\r\norder to prevent any possible conflict, they interpose in advance a wall\r\nof separation, a compartment partition,[5350]\" which prevents them from\r\nmeeting and clashing. Others, at length, clever or not too clear-sighted\r\npoliticians, try to force their agreement, either by assigning to each\r\nits domain and in prohibiting mutual access, or by uniting both domains\r\nthrough the semblance of bridges, by imitation stairways, and other\r\nillusory communications which the phantasmagoria of human eloquence can\r\nalways establish between incompatible things and which procure for man,\r\nif not the acquisition of a truth, at least a pleasure in the play\r\nof words. The ascendancy of the Catholic faith over these uncertain,\r\ninconsequent, tormented souls is more or less weak or strong according\r\nto time, place, circumstance, individuals and groups; in the larger\r\ngroup it has diminished, while it has increased in the smaller one.\r\n\r\nThe latter comprises the regular and secular clergy with its approximate\r\nrecruits and its small body of supporters; never was it so exemplary and\r\nso fervent; the monastic institution in particular never flourished so\r\nspontaneously and more usefully. Nowhere in Europe are more missionaries\r\nformed, so many \"brethren\" for small schools, so many volunteers, male\r\nand female, in the service of the poor, the sick, the infirm and of\r\nchildren, such vast communities of women freely devoting their lives to\r\nteaching and to charity.[5351] Life in common, under uniform and strict\r\nrules, to a people like the French, more capable than any other of\r\nenthusiasm and of emulation, of generosity and of discipline, naturally\r\nprone to equality, sociable and predisposed to fraternity through the\r\nneed of companionship, sober, moreover, and laborious, a life in common\r\nis no more distasteful in the convent than in the barracks, nor in\r\nan ecclesiastical army more than in a lay army, while France, always\r\nGallic, affords as ready a hold nowadays to the Roman system as in the\r\ntime of Augustus. When this system obtains a hold on a soul it keeps\r\nits hold, and the belief it imposes becomes the principal guest, the\r\nsovereign occupant of the intellect. Faith, in this occupied territory,\r\nno longer allows her title to be questioned; she condemns doubt as a\r\nsin, she interdicts investigation as a temptation, she presents the\r\nperil of un belief as a mortal danger, she enrolls conscience in her\r\nservice against any possible revolt of reason. At the same time that she\r\nguards herself against attacks, she strengthens her possession; to\r\nthis end, the rites she prescribes are efficient, and their efficiency,\r\nmultiplicity and convergence--confession and communion, retreats,\r\nspiritual exercises, abstinences, and ceremonies of every kind, the\r\nworship of saints and of the Virgin, of relics and images, orisons on\r\nthe lips and from the heart, faithful attendance on the services and the\r\nexact fulfillment of daily duties--all attest it.\r\n\r\nThrough its latest acquisitions and the turn it now takes, Catholic\r\nfaith buries itself in and penetrates down to the very depths of\r\nthe sensitive and tried souls which it has preserved from foreign\r\ninfluences; for it supplies to this chosen flock the aliment it most\r\nneeds and which it loves the best. Below the metaphysical, abstract\r\nTrinity, of which two of the three persons are out of reach of the\r\nimagination, she has set up an historical Trinity whose personages are\r\nall perceptible to the senses, Mary, Joseph and Jesus. The Virgin, since\r\nthe dogma of the Immaculate Conception, has risen to an extraordinary\r\nheight; her spouse accompanies her in her exaltation;[5352] between them\r\nstands their son, child or man, which forms the Holy Family.[5353] No\r\nworship is more natural and more engaging to chaste celibates in whose\r\nbrain a pure, vague vision is always present, the reverie of a family\r\nconstituted without the intervention of sex. No system of worship\r\nfurnishes so many precise objects for adoration, all the acts and\r\noccurrences, the emotions and thoughts of three adorable lives from\r\nbirth to death and in the beyond, down to the present day. Most of\r\nthe religious institutions founded within the past eighty years devote\r\nthemselves to meditation on one of these lives considered at some one\r\npoint of incident or of character, either purity, charity, compassion\r\nor justice, conception, nativity or infancy, presence in the Temple,\r\nat Nazareth, at Bethany, or on Calvary, the passion, the agony, the\r\nassumption or apparition under this or that circumstance or place, and\r\nthe rest. There are now in France, under the name and patronage of Saint\r\nJoseph alone, one hundred and seventeen congregations and communities\r\nof women. Among so many appellations, consisting of special watchwords\r\ndesignating and summing up the particular preferences of a devout\r\ngroup, one name is significant there are seventy-nine congregations or\r\ncommunities of women which have devoted themselves to the heart of Mary\r\nor of Jesus or to both together.[5354] In this way, besides the narrow\r\ndevotion which is attached to the corporeal emblem, a tender piety\r\npursues and attains its supreme end, the mute converse of the soul, not\r\nwith the dim Infinite, the indifferent Almighty who acts through general\r\nlaws, but with a person, a divine person clothed with the vesture of\r\nhumanity and who has not discarded it, who has lived, suffered and\r\nloved, who still loves, who, in glory above, welcomes there the\r\neffusions of his faithful souls and who returns love for love.\r\n\r\nAll this is incomprehensible, bizarre or even repulsive to the public at\r\nlarge, and still more so to the vulgar. It sees in religion only what\r\nis very plain, a government; and in France, it has already had enough of\r\ngovernment temporally; add a complementary one on the spiritual side and\r\nthat will be more and too much. Alongside of the tax-collector and the\r\ngendarme in uniform, the peasant, the workman and the common citizen\r\nencounter the curé in his cassock who, in the name of the Church,\r\nas with the other two in the name of the State, gives him orders and\r\nsubjects him to rules and regulations. Now every rule is annoying and\r\nthe latter more than the others; one is rid of the tax-collector after\r\npaying the tax, and of the gendarme when no act is committed against the\r\nlaw; the curé is much more exacting; he interferes in domestic life and\r\nin private matters and assumes to govern man entirely. He admonishes his\r\nparishioners in the confessional and from the pulpit, he lords it over\r\nthem even in their inmost being, and his injunctions bind them in every\r\nact, even at home, around the fireside, at table and in bed, comprising\r\ntheir moments of repose and relaxation, even hours of leisure and in the\r\ntavern. Villagers, after listening to a sermon against the tavern and\r\ndrunkenness, murmur and are heard to exclaim: \"Why does he meddle with\r\nour affairs? Let him say his mass and leave us alone.\" They need him\r\nfor baptism, marriage and burial, but their affairs do not concern him.\r\nMoreover, among the observances he prescribes, many are inconvenient,\r\ntasteless or disagreeable--fasting, Lent, a passive part in a Latin\r\nmass, prolonged services, ceremonies of which the details are all\r\ninsignificant, but of which the symbolic meaning is to-day of no account\r\nto people in attendance; add to all this the mechanical recitation of\r\nthe Pater and of the Ave, genuflections and crossing one's self, and\r\nespecially obligatory confession at specified dates. Nowadays the worker\r\nand the peasant manage without these constraints. In many villages,\r\nthere is nobody at high mass on Sundays but women, and often, in small\r\nnumbers, one or two troops of children led by the clerical instructor\r\nand by the \"Sister,\" with a few old men; the great majority of the men\r\nremain outside, under the porch and on the square before the church\r\nchatting with each other about the crops, on local news and on the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century, when a curé was obliged to report to the\r\n\"intendant\" the number of inhabitants of his parish, he had only to\r\ncount his communicants at the Easter service; their number was about\r\nthat of the adult and valid population, say one half or two fifths of\r\nthe sum total.[5355] Now, at Paris, out of two millions of Catholics who\r\nare of age, about one hundred thousand perform this strict duty, aware\r\nof its being strict and the imperative prescription of which is\r\nstamped in their memory by a rhyme which they have learned in their\r\ninfancy;[5356] out of one hundred persons, this is equal to five\r\ncommunicants, of which four are women and one is a man, in other words,\r\nabout one woman out of twelve or thirteen and one man out of fifty. In\r\nthe provinces,[5357] and especially in the country, there is good reason\r\nfor doubling and even tripling these figures; in the latter case, the\r\nmost favorable one and, without any doubt, the rarest, the proportion of\r\nprofessed Christians is that of one to four among women and one man\r\nout of twelve. Evidently, with the others who make not attend Church\r\nregularly, with the three women and the eleven other men, their faith is\r\nonly verbal; if they are still Catholics, it is on the outside and not\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nBesides this separation from the main body and this indifference, other\r\nsigns denote disaffection and even hostility.--In Paris, at the height\r\nof the Revolution, in May and June 1793, the shopkeepers, artisans\r\nand market-women, the whole of the common people, were still\r\nreligious,[5358] \"kneeling in the street\" when the Host passed by, and\r\nbefore the relics of Saint Leu carried along in ceremonial procession,\r\npassionately fond of his worship, and suddenly melted, \"ashamed,\r\nrepentant and with tears in their eyes, when, inadvertently, their\r\nJacobin rulers tolerated the publicity of a procession. Nowadays,\r\namong the craftsmen, shopkeepers and lower class of employees, there\r\nis nothing more unpopular than the Catholic Church. Twice, under\r\nthe Restoration and the second Empire, she has joined hands with a\r\nrepressive government, while its clergy has seemed to be not merely an\r\nefficient organ but, again, the central promoter of all repression.--\r\nHence, accumulated bitterness that still survives. After 1830, the\r\narchbishopric of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois is sacked; in 1871 the\r\narchbishop and other ecclesiastical hostages are murdered. For two\r\nyears after 1830 a priest in his cassock dared not show himself in\r\npublic;[5359] he ran the risk of being insulted in the streets; since\r\n1871, the majority of the Parisian electors, through the interposition\r\nof the Municipal Council which they elect over and over again, persists\r\nin driving \"Brethren\" and \"Sisters\" from the schools and hospitals in\r\norder to put laymen in their places and pay twice as much for work not\r\ndone as well.[5360]--In the beginning, antipathy was confined to the\r\nclergy; through contamination, it reached the doctrine, to include the\r\nfaith, the entire Catholicism and even Christianity itself. Under the\r\nRestoration, it was called, in provocative language, the priest party,\r\nand under the second Empire, the clericals. Afterwards, confronting the\r\nChurch and under a contrary name, the anti-clerical league was formed by\r\nits adversaries, a sort of negative church which possessed, or tried\r\nto, its own dogmas and rites, its own assemblies and discipline: and for\r\nlack of something better, it has its own fanaticism, that of aversion;\r\non the word being given, it marches, rank and file, against the other,\r\nits enemy, and manifests, if not its belief, at least its unbelief in\r\nrefusing or in avoiding the ministration of the priest. In Paris, twenty\r\nfunerals out of a hundred, purely civil, are not held in a church; out\r\nof one hundred marriages, twenty-five, purely civil, are not blessed by\r\nthe Church; twenty-four infants out of a hundred are not baptized.[5361]\r\n\r\nAnd, from Paris to the provinces, both sentiment and example are\r\npropagated. For sixteen years, in our parliaments elected by universal\r\nsuffrage, the majority maintains that party in power which wages war\r\nagainst the Church; which, systematically and on principle, is and\r\nremains hostile to the Catholic religion; which has its own religion for\r\nwhich it claims dominion; which is possessed by a doctrinal spirit, and,\r\nin the direction of intellects and souls, aims at substituting this new\r\nspirit for the old one; which, as far as it can, withdraws from the\r\nold one its influence, or its share in education and in charity; which\r\nbreaks up the congregations of men, and overtaxes congregations of\r\nwomen; which enrolls seminarians in the army, and deprives suspect curés\r\nof their salaries; in short, which, through its acts collectively and\r\nin practice, proclaims itself anti-Catholic. Many of its acts certainly\r\ndisplease the peasant. He would prefer to retain the teaching \"brother\"\r\nin the public school and the \"sister\" in the hospital as nurse or as\r\nteacher in the school; both would cost less, and he is used to their\r\ndark dresses and their white caps; moreover, he is not ill-disposed\r\ntowards his resident curé, who is a \"good fellow.\" Nevertheless, in sum,\r\nthe rule of the curé is not to his taste; he does not wish to have him\r\nback, and he distrusts priests, especially the aspect of their allies\r\nwho now consist of the upper bourgeoisie and the nobles. Hence, out\r\nof ten million electors, five or six millions, entertaining\r\npartial dislikes and mute reservations, continue to vote, at least\r\nprovisionally, for anti-Christian radicals. All this shows that,\r\nthrough an insensible and slow reaction, the great rural mass, following\r\nthe example of the great urban mass, is again becoming pagan[5362]; for\r\none hundred years the wheel turns in this sense, without stopping, and\r\nthis is serious, still more serious for the nation than for the Church.\r\n\r\nIn France, the inner Christianity, has, for all that, through the dual\r\neffect of its Catholic and French envelope, grown warmer among the\r\nclergy especially among the regular clergy, but is has cooled off among\r\nthe people and it is especially here that it is needed.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nPost Scriptum:\r\n\r\nTaine died in 1893 not long after having written this. Much has happened\r\nsince and the struggle between \"Lay Republicans\" and the Catholic\r\nChurch has continued. In \"QUID 2000,\" a French popular reference manual\r\ncontaining on page 515 some notes on the evolution of the Catholic\r\nreligion in France, we can read the following:\r\n\r\n\"1899-11-11 the police occupies l'Assomption, 6, rue François Ier. The\r\nAugustin brothers are accused in court for breaking the law forbidding\r\nunauthorized assemblies... 1900 Thomas, mayor of Kremlin-Bicêtre,\r\nforbids the wearing of the ecclesiastical costume in his town. This\r\nexample is followed by others...\" Reading further we may learn that\r\nlater in 1901 to 1904 the various Catholic orders are forbidden\r\nor dissolved and most French Church property seized. In 1905 a law\r\ndecreeing a separation between the State and the Church is narrowly and\r\nbitterly voted and a struggle between France and the Pope begins ...\r\nBetween 1914 and 1918 25 000 priests and seminarians are mobilized and\r\napp. 5000 among them fall. This disarms many of the Church's enemies and\r\nin 1920 funds are appropriated for the re-establishment of the French\r\nembassy to the Pope in Rome. etc. etc. Today the Catholic religion is\r\ntolerated more or less in the same manner as Judaism, Islam etc. (SR.)\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5301: The Budget of 1881. 17,010 desservans of small parishes\r\nhave 900 francs per annum; 4500 have 1000 francs; 9492, sixty years of\r\nage and over, have from 1100 to 1300 francs. 2521 curés of the second\r\nclass have from 1200 to 1300 francs; 850 curés of the first class, or\r\nrated the same, have from 1500 to 1600 francs; 65 archiprêtre curés have\r\n1600 francs, that of Paris 2400 francs; 709 canons have from 1600 to\r\n2400 francs; 193 vicars-general have from 2500 to 4000 francs.--Abbé\r\nBougaud, \"le Grand Péril,\" etc., p.23.

Such, for example, was M. Pie, bishop\r\nof Poitiers, nominated by M. de Falloux in the time of the\r\nPrince-President, and so annoying during the Empire; in order to keep\r\nhim in check, M. Levert, the cleverest and most adroit prefect, had to\r\nbe sent to Poitiers; for many years they waged the most desperate war\r\nunder proper formalities, each playing against the other the shrewdest\r\nand most disagreeable tricks.

Public instruction and its three effects.\r\n\r\n     Public instruction and its three effects.--Influences of the\r\n     master, of the pupils on each other, and of discipline.\r\n     --Case in which all three tend towards producing a particular\r\n     type of man.\r\n\r\nAT fixed intervals a man, in a room, gathers around him children,\r\nyouths, a group of young people, ten, twenty, thirty or more; he talks\r\nto them for one or two hours and they listen to him. They sit alongside\r\nof each other, look in each other's faces, touch each other's elbows,\r\nfeel that they are class-mates, of the same age and occupied with the\r\nsame tasks. They form a society and in two ways, one with another and\r\nall with the master. Hence they live under a statute: every society has\r\none of its own, spontaneous or imposed on it; as soon as men, little or\r\nbig, come together in any number, in a drawing-room, in a café, in the\r\nstreet, they find themselves subject to a local charter, a sort of code\r\nwhich prescribes to them, or interdicts a certain sort of conduct. And\r\nso with the school: positive rules along with many tacit rules are\r\nhere observed and these form a mould which stamps on minds and souls a\r\nlasting imprint. Whatever a public lesson may be, whatever its object,\r\nsecular or ecclesiastic, whether its subject-matter is religious or\r\nscientific, from the bottom to the top of the scale, from the primary\r\nschool and the catechism up to the great seminary, in upper schools and\r\nin the faculties, we find in abridgment the academic institution. Of all\r\nsocial engines, it is probably the most powerful and the most efficient;\r\nfor it exercises three kinds of influence on the young lives it enfolds\r\nand directs, one through the teacher, another through the fellow\r\nstudents and the last through rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the master, considered a scholar, teaches with\r\nauthority and the pupils, who feel that they are ignorant, learn with\r\nconfidence.--On the other hand, outside of his family and the domestic\r\ncircle, the student finds in his group of comrades a new, different\r\nand complete world which has its own ways and customs, its own sense of\r\nhonor and its own vices, its own view of things (esprit de corps),\r\nin which independent and spontaneous judgments arise, precocious and\r\nhaphazard presentiments, expressions of opinion on all things human and\r\ndivine. It is in this environment that he begins to think for himself,\r\nin contact with others like himself and his equals, in contact with\r\ntheir ideas, much more intelligible and acceptable to him than those of\r\nmature men, and therefore much more persuasive, contagious and exciting;\r\nthese form for him the ambient, penetrating atmosphere in which his\r\nthought arises, grows and shapes itself; he here adopts his way of\r\nlooking at the great society of adults of which he is soon to become\r\na member, his first notions of justice and injustice, and hence an\r\nanticipated attitude of respect or of rebellion, in short, a\r\nprejudice which, according as the spirit of the group is reasonable\r\nor unreasonable, is either sound or unsound, social or\r\nantisocial.--Finally, the discipline of the school has its effect.\r\nWhatever its rules and regulations may be, whether liberal or despotic,\r\nlax or strict, monastic, military or worldly, whether a boarding or a\r\nday school, mixed or exclusive, in town or in country, with predominance\r\nof gymnastic training or intellectual efforts, with the mind given to\r\nthe study of things or to the study of words, the pupil enters into\r\na ready-made setting. According to the diversities of this setting\r\nor framework he practices different exercises; he contracts different\r\nhabits; he is developed or stunted physically or morally, in one sense\r\nor in a contrary sense. Hence, just as the system is good or bad, he\r\nbecomes more or less capable or incapable of bodily or mental effort,\r\nof reflection, of invention, of taking the initiative, of starting an\r\nenterprise, of subordinating himself to a given purpose, of willing,\r\npersistent association, that is to say, in sum, of playing an active and\r\nuseful part on the stage of the world he is about to enter upon. Observe\r\nthat this apprenticeship in common, sitting on benches according to\r\ncertain regulations and under a master, lasts six, ten, fifteen years\r\nand often twenty; that girls are not exempt from it; that not one boy\r\nout of a hundred is educated to the end at home by a private teacher;\r\nthat, in secondary and even in superior instruction, the school wheel\r\nturns uniformly and without stopping ten hours a day if the scholar\r\nboards outside, and twenty-four hours a day if he boards within; that\r\nat this age the human clay is soft, that it has not yet received its\r\nshape, that no acquired and resistant form yet protects it from the\r\npotter's hand, against the weight of the turning-wheel, against the\r\nfriction of other morsels of clay kneaded alongside of it, against the\r\nthree pressures, constant and prolonged, which compose public education.\r\n\r\nEvidently, there is here an enormous force, especially if the three\r\npressures, instead of opposing each other, as often happens, combine and\r\nconverge towards the production of a certain finished type of man; if,\r\nfrom infancy to youth and from youth to adult age, the successive stages\r\nof preparation are superposed in such a way as to stamp the adopted type\r\ndeeper and with more exactness; if all the influences and operations\r\nthat impress it, near or far, great or small, internal or external, form\r\ntogether a coherent, defined, applicable and applied system. Let the\r\nState undertake its fabrication and application, let it monopolize\r\npublic education, let it become its regulator, director and contractor,\r\nlet it set up and work its machine throughout the length and breadth of\r\nthe land, let it, through moral authority and legal constraint, force\r\nthe new generation to enter therein--it will find twenty years later\r\nin these minors who have become major, the kind and number of ideas it\r\naimed to provide, the extent, limit and form of mind it approves of, and\r\nthe moral and social prejudice that suits its purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Napoleon's Educational Instruments.\r\n\r\n     Napoleon's aim.--University monopoly.--Revival and multitude\r\n     of private schools.--Napoleon regards them unfavorably.--His\r\n     motives.--Private enterprises compete with public\r\n     enterprise.--Measures against them.--Previous authorization\r\n     necessary and optional suppression of them.--Taxes on free\r\n     education in favor of the university.--Decree of November,\r\n     1811.--Limitation of secondary teaching in private schools.\r\n     --How the university takes away their pupils.--Day-schools as\r\n     prescribed.--Number of boarders limited.--Measures for the\r\n     restriction or assimilation of ecclesiastical schools.\r\n     --Recruits forcibly obtained in prominent and ill-disposed\r\n     families.--Napoleon the sole educator in his empire.\r\n\r\nSuch is the aim of Napoleon:[6101]\r\n\r\n\"In the establishment of an educational corps,\" he says to\r\nhimself,[6102] \"my principal aim is to secure the means for directing\r\npolitical and moral opinions.\"\r\n\r\nStill more precisely, he counts on the new institution to set up and\r\nkeep open for inspection a universal and complete police registry. \"This\r\nregistry must be organized in such a way as to keep notes on each child\r\nafter age of nine years.\"[6103] Having seized adults he wants to seize\r\nchildren also, watch and shape future Frenchmen in advance; brought up\r\nby him, in his hands or in sight, they become ready-made a assistants,\r\ndocile subjects and more docile than their parents.[6104] Amongst the\r\nlatter, there are still to many unsubmissive and refractory spirits, too\r\nmany royalists and too many republicans; domestic traditions from family\r\nto family contradict each other or vary, and children grow up in their\r\nhomes only to clash with each other in society afterwards. Let us\r\nanticipate this conflict; let us prepare them for concord; all brought\r\nup in the same fashion, they will some day or other find themselves\r\nunanimous,[6105] not only apparently, as nowadays through fear or force,\r\nbut in fact and fundamentally, through inveterate habit and by previous\r\nadaptation of imagination and affection. Otherwise, \"there will be\r\nno stable political state\" in France;[6106] \"so long as one grows up\r\nwithout knowing whether to be a republican or monarchist, Catholic\r\nor irreligious, the State will never form a nation; it will rest on\r\nuncertain and vague foundations; it will be constantly exposed to\r\ndisorder and change.\"--Consequently, he assigns to himself the monopoly\r\nof public instruction; he alone is to enjoy the right to manufacture and\r\nsell this just like salt and tobacco; \"public instruction, throughout\r\nthe Empire, is entrusted exclusively to the university. No school, no\r\nestablishment for instruction whatever,\" superior, secondary, primary,\r\nspecial, general, collateral, secular or ecclesiastic, \"may be organized\r\noutside of the imperial university and without the authorization of its\r\nchief.\"[6107]\r\n\r\nEvery factory of educational commodities within these boundaries and\r\noperating under this direction is of two sorts. Some of them, in the\r\nbest places, interconnected and skillfully grouped, are national\r\nunits founded by the government, or at its command, by the communes,--\r\nfaculties, lycées, colleges, and small communal schools; others,\r\nisolated and scattered about, are private institutions founded by\r\nindividuals, such as boarding-schools and institutions for secondary\r\ninstruction, small free schools. The former, State undertakings, ruled,\r\nmanaged, supported and turned to account by it, according to the plan\r\nprescribed by it and for the object it has proposed, are simply a\r\nprolongation of itself; it is the State which operates in them and\r\nwhich, directly and entirely, acts through them: they enjoy therefore\r\nall its favor and the others all its disfavor. The latter, during\r\nthe Consulate, revived or sprung up by hundreds, in all directions,\r\nspontaneously, under the pressure of necessity, and because the young\r\nneed instruction as they need clothes, but haphazard, as required\r\naccording to demand and supply, without any superior or common\r\nregulation--nothing being more antipathetic to the governmental genius\r\nof Napoleon:\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible,\"[6108] he says, \"to remain longer as we are, since\r\neverybody can start an education shop the same as a cloth shop\"\r\n\r\nand furnish as he pleases, or as his customers please, this or that\r\npiece of stuff, even of poor quality, and of this or that fashion,\r\neven extravagant or out of date: hence so many different dresses, and a\r\nhorrible medley. One good obligatory coat, of stout cloth and suitable\r\ncut, a uniform for which the public authority supplies the pattern, is\r\nwhat should go on the back of every child, youth or young man; private\r\nindividuals who undertake this matter are mistrusted beforehand. Even\r\nwhen obedient, they are only half-docile; they take their own course\r\nand have their own preferences, they follow their own taste or that of\r\nparents. Every private enterprise, simply because it exists and thrives,\r\nconstitutes a more or less independent and dissenting group, Napoleon,\r\non learning that Sainte-Barbe, restored under the direction of M. de\r\nLanneau, had five hundred inmates, exclaims:[6109] \"How does it happen\r\nthat an ordinary private individual has so many in his house?\" The\r\nEmperor almost seems jealous; it seems as if he had just discovered a\r\nrival in one corner of his university domain; this man is an usurper on\r\nthe domain of the sovereign; he has constituted himself a centre; he has\r\ncollected around him clients and a platoon; now, as Louis XIV. said, the\r\nState must have no \"platoons apart.\" Since M. de Lanneau has talent\r\nand is successful, let him enter the official ranks and become a\r\nfunctionary. Napoleon at once means to get hold of him, his house and\r\nhis pupils, and orders M. de Fontaines, Grand-Master of the University,\r\nto negotiate the affair; M. de Lanneau will be suitably compensated;\r\nSainte-Barbe will be formed into a lycée, and M. de Lanneau shall be\r\nput at the head of it. Let it be noted that he is not an opponent, an\r\nirregular: M. de Fontaines himself praises his teaching, his excellent\r\nmind, his perfect exactitude, and calls him the universitarian of the\r\nuniversity. But he does not belong to it, he stands aloof and stays\r\nat home, he is not disposed to become a mere cog-wheel in the imperial\r\nmanufactory. Therefore, whether he is aware of it or not, he does\r\nit harm and all the more according to his prosperity; his full house\r\nempties the lycées; the more pupils he has the less they have. Private\r\nenterprises in their essence enter into competition with public\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, if tolerated by the latter, it is reluctantly and\r\nbecause nothing else can be done; there are too many of them; the money\r\nand the means to replace them at one stroke would be wanting. Moreover,\r\nwith instruction, the consumers, as with other supplies and commodities,\r\nnaturally dislike monopoly; they must be gradually brought to it;\r\nresignation must come to them through habit. The State, accordingly, may\r\nallow private enterprises to exist, at least for the time being. But,\r\non condition of their being kept in the strictest dependence, of its\r\narrogating to itself the right over them of life and death, of reducing\r\nthem to the state of tributaries and branches, of utilizing them, of\r\ntransforming their native and injurious rivalry into a fruitful and\r\nforced collaboration. Not only must private schools obtain from the\r\nState its express consent to be born, for lack of which they are closed\r\nand their principals punished,[6110] but again, even when licensed, they\r\nlive subject to the good-will of the Grand-Master, who can and must\r\nclose them as soon as he recognizes in them \"grave abuses and principles\r\ncontrary to those professed by the University.\" Meanwhile, the\r\nUniversity supports itself with their funds; since it alone has the\r\nright to teach, it may profit by this right, concede for money the\r\nfaculty of teaching or of being taught alongside of it, oblige every\r\nhead of an institution to pay so much for himself and so much for\r\neach of his pupils; in sum, here as elsewhere, in derogation of the\r\nuniversity blockade, as with the continental blockade, the state sells\r\nlicenses to certain parties. So true is this that, even with superior\r\ninstruction, when nobody competes with it, it sells them: every graduate\r\nwho gives a course of lectures on literature or on science must pay\r\nbeforehand, for the year, 75 francs at Paris and 50 francs in the\r\nprovinces. Every graduate who begin to lecture on law or medicine\r\nmust pay beforehand 150 francs at Paris and 100 francs in the\r\nprovinces.[6111] There is the same annual duty on the directors of\r\nsecondary schools, boarding-schools and private institutions. Moreover,\r\nto obtain the indispensable license, the master of a boarding-school at\r\nParis must pay 300 francs, and in a province 200 francs; the principal\r\nof an institution in Paris pays 600 francs, and in the provinces 400\r\nfrancs; besides that, this license, always revocable, is granted only\r\nfor ten years; at the end of the ten years the titular must obtain\r\na renewal and pay the tax anew. As to his pupils, of whatever kind,\r\nboarding scholars, day scholars, or even gratis,[6112] the University\r\nlevies on each a tax equal to the twentieth of the cost of full board;\r\nthe director himself of the establishment is the one who fixes and\r\nlevies the tax; he is the responsible collector of it, book-keeper\r\nand the debtor. Let him not forget to declare exactly the terms of his\r\nschool and the number of his pupils; otherwise, there is investigation,\r\nverification, condemnation, restitution, fine, censure, and the possible\r\nclosing of his establishment.\r\n\r\nRegulations, stricter and stricter, tighten the cord around his neck\r\nand, in 1811, the rigid articles of the last decree draw so tight as to\r\ninsure certain strangling at short date. Napoleon counts on that.[6113]\r\nFor his lycées, especially at the start, have not succeeded; they have\r\nfailed to obtain the confidence of families;[6114] the discipline is too\r\nmilitary, the education is not sufficiently paternal, the principals and\r\nprofessors are only indifferent functionaries, more or less egoist or\r\nworldly. Only former subaltern officers, rude and foul-mouthed, serve\r\nas superintendents and assistant-teachers. The holders of State\r\nscholarships bring with them \"habits fashioned out of a bad education,\"\r\nor by the ignorance of almost no education at all,[6115] so that \"for\r\na child that is well born and well brought up,\" their companionship is\r\nlopsided and their contact as harmful as it is repulsive. Consequently,\r\nthe lycées during the first years,[6116] solely filled with the few\r\nholders of scholarships, remain deserted or scarcely occupied, whilst\r\n\"the élite of the young crowd into more or less expensive private\r\nschools.\"\r\n\r\nThis élite of which the University is thus robbed must be got back.\r\nSince the young do not attend the lycée because they like it, they must\r\ncome through necessity; to this end, other issues are rendered difficult\r\nand several are entirely barred; and better still, all those that are\r\ntolerated are made to converge to one sole central outlet, a university\r\nestablishment, in such a way that the director of each private school,\r\nchanged from a rival into a purveyor, serves the university instead\r\nof injuring it and gives it pupils instead of taking them away. In the\r\nfirst place, his high standard of instruction is limited;[6117] even\r\nin the country and in the towns that have neither lycée nor college, he\r\nmust teach nothing above a fixed degree; if he is the principal of an\r\ninstitution, this degree must not go beyond the class of the humanities;\r\nhe must leave to the faculties of the State their domain intact,\r\ndifferential calculus, astronomy, geology, natural history and superior\r\nliterature. If he is the master of a boarding-school, this degree must\r\nnot extend beyond grammar classes, nor the first elements of geometry\r\nand arithmetic; he must leave to State lycées and colleges their domain\r\nintact, the humanities properly so called, superior lectures and means\r\nof secondary instruction.--In the second place, in the towns possessing\r\na lycée or college, he must teach at home only what the University\r\nleaves untaught;[6118] he is not deprived, indeed, of the younger boys;\r\nhe may still instruct and keep them; but he must conduct all his pupils\r\nover ten years of age to the college or lycée, where they will regularly\r\nfollow the classes as day-scholars. Consequently, daily and twice a\r\nday, he marches them to and fro between his house and the university\r\nestablishment; before going, in the intermission, and after the class is\r\ndismissed he examines them in the lesson they have received out of\r\nhis house; apart from that, he lodges and feeds them, his office\r\nbeing reduced to this. He is nothing beyond a watched and serviceable\r\nauxiliary, a subaltern, a University tutor and \"coach,\" a sort of\r\nunpaid, or rather paying, schoolmaster and innkeeper in its employ.\r\n\r\nAll this does not yet suffice. Not only does the State recruit its\r\nday-scholars in his establishment but it takes from him his\r\nboarding-scholars. \"On and after the first of November 1812,[6119] the\r\nheads of institutions and the masters of boarding-schools shall receive\r\nno resident pupils in their houses above the age of nine years, until\r\nthe lycée or college, established in the same town or place where there\r\nis a lycée, shall have as many boarders as it can take.\" This complement\r\nshall be 300 boarders per lycée; there are to be \"80 lycées in full\r\noperation \"during the year 1812, and 100 in the course of the year 1813,\r\nso that, at this last date, the total of the complement demanded,\r\nwithout counting that of the colleges, amounts to 30,000\r\nboarding-scholars. Such is the enormous levy of the State on the crop of\r\nboarding-school pupils. It evidently seizes the entire crop in advance;\r\nprivate establishments, after it, can only glean, and through tolerance.\r\nIn reality, the decree forbids them to receive boarding-scholars;\r\nhenceforth, the University will have the monopoly of them.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings against the small seminaries, more energetic\r\ncompetitors, are still more vigorous. \"There shall be but one secondary\r\necclesiastical school in each department; the Grand-Master will\r\ndesignate those that are to be maintained; the others are to be closed.\r\nNone of them shall be in the country. All those not situated in a\r\ntown provided with a lycée or with a college shall be closed. All\r\nthe buildings and furniture belonging to the ecclesiastic schools\r\nnot retained shall be seized and confiscated for the benefit of the\r\nUniversity. \"In all places where ecclesiastical schools exist, the\r\npupils of these schools shall be taken to the lycée or college and join\r\nits classes.\" Finally, \"all these schools shall be under the control of\r\nthe University; they must be organized only by her; their prospectus and\r\ntheir regulations must be drawn up by the council of the University at\r\nthe suggestion of the Grand Master. The teaching must be done only by\r\nmembers of the University at the disposition of the Grand Master.\" In\r\nlike manner, in the lay schools, at Sainte-Barbe for example,[6120]\r\nevery professor, private tutor, or even common superintendent, must\r\nbe provided with a special authorization by the University. Staff and\r\ndiscipline, the spirit and matter of the teaching, every detail of study\r\nand recreation,[6121] all are imposed, conducted and restrained in these\r\nso-called free establishments; whatever they may be, ecclesiastic or\r\nsecular, not only does the University surround and hamper them, but\r\nagain it absorbs and assimilates them; it does not even leave them\r\nany external distinctive appearance. It is true that, in the small\r\nseminaries, the exercises begin at the ringing of a bell, and the pupils\r\nwear an ecclesiastic dress; but the priest's gown, adopted by the State\r\nthat adopts the Church, is still a State uniform. In the other private\r\nestablishments, the uniform is that which it imposes, the lay uniform,\r\nbelonging to colleges and lycées \"under penalty of being closed \";\r\nwhile, in addition, there is the drum, the demeanor, the habits, ways\r\nand regularity of the barracks. All initiative, all invention, all\r\ndiversity, every professional or local adaptation is abolished.[6122]\r\nM. de Lanneau thus wrote[6123]: \"I am nothing but a sergeant-major of\r\nlanguid and mangled classes... to the tap of a drum and under military\r\ncolors.\"\r\n\r\nAgainst the encroachments of this institutional university there is no\r\nlonger neither public nor private shelter, since even domestic education\r\nat home, is not respected. In 1808,[6124] \"among the old and wealthy\r\nfamilies which are not in the system,\" Napoleon selects ten from each\r\ndepartment and fifty at Paris of which the sons from sixteen to eighteen\r\nmust be compelled to go to Saint-Cyr and, on leaving it, into the army\r\nas second lieutenants.[6125] In 1813, he adds 10,000 more of them, many\r\nof whom are the sons of Conventionalists or Vendéans, who, under the\r\ntitle of guards of honor, are to form a corps apart and who are at once\r\ntrained in the barracks. All the more necessary is the subjection\r\nto this Napoleonic education of the sons of important and refractory\r\nfamilies, everywhere numerous in the annexed countries. Already in\r\n1802, Fourcroy had explained in a report to the legislative corps the\r\npolitical and social utility of the future University.[6126] Napoleon,\r\nat his discretion, may recruit and select scholars among his recent\r\nsubjects; only, it is not in a lycée that he places them, but in a still\r\nmore military school, at La Fléche, of which the pupils are all sons of\r\nofficers and, so to say, children of the army. Towards the end of 1812,\r\nhe orders the Roman prince Patrizzi to send his two sons to this school,\r\none seventeen years of age and the other thirteen[6127]; and, to be\r\nsure of them, he has them taken from their home and brought there by\r\ngendarmes. Along with these, 90 other Italians of high rank are counted\r\nat La Fléche, the Dorias, the Paliavicinis, the Alfieris, with 120 young\r\nmen of the Illyrian provinces, others again furnished by the countries\r\nof the Rhine confederation, in all 360 inmates at 800 per annum. The\r\nparents might often accompany or follow their children and establish\r\nthemselves within reach of them. This privilege was not granted to\r\nPrince Patrizzi; he was stopped on the road at Marseilles and kept\r\nthere.--In this way, through the skilful combination of legislative\r\nprescriptions with arbitrary appointments, Napoleon becomes in fact,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, the sole head-schoolmaster of all Frenchmen old\r\nor newcomers, the unique and universal educator in his empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Napoleon's machinery.\r\n\r\n     His machinery.--The educating body.--How its members come\r\n     to realize their union.--Hierarchy of rank.--How ambition\r\n     and amour-propre are gratified.--The monastic principle of\r\n     celibacy.--The monastic and military principle of\r\n     obedience.--Obligations contracted and discipline enforced.\r\n     --The École Normale and recruits for the future university.\r\n\r\nTo effect this purpose, he requires a good instrument, some great human\r\nmachine which designed, put together and set up by himself, henceforth\r\nworks alone and of its own accord, without deviating or breaking down,\r\nconformably to his instructions and always under his eye, but without\r\nthe necessity of his lending a hand and personally interfering in its\r\npredetermined and calculated movement. The finest engines of this\r\nsort are the religious orders, masterpieces of the Catholic, Roman and\r\ngovernmental mind, all managed from above according to fixed rules in\r\nview of a definite object, so many kinds of intelligent automatons,\r\nalone capable of working indefinitely without loss of energy, with\r\npersistency, uniformity and precision, at the minimum of cost and the\r\nmaximum of effect, and this through the simple play of their internal\r\nmechanism which, fully regulated beforehand, adapts them completely and\r\nready-made to this special service, to the social operations which a\r\nrecognized authority and a superior intelligence have assigned to\r\nthem as their function.--Nothing could be better suited to the social\r\ninstinct of Napoleon, to his imagination, his taste, his political\r\npolicy and his plans, and on this point he loftily proclaims his\r\npreferences.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" says he to the Council of State, \"that the Jesuits, as regards\r\ninstruction, have left a very great void. I do not want to restore them,\r\nnor any other body that has its sovereign at Rome.\"[6128]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, one is necessary. \"As for myself, I would rather confide\r\npublic education to a religious order than leave it as it is to-day,\"\r\nwhich means free and abandoned to private individuals. \"But I want\r\nneither one nor the other.\" Two conditions are requisite for the new\r\nestablishment. First of all,\r\n\r\n\"I want a corporation because a corporation never dies\"; it alone,\r\nthrough its perpetuity, maintains teaching in the way marked out for it,\r\nbrings up \"according to fixed principles\" successive generations, thus\r\nassuring the stability of the political State, and \"inspires youth with\r\na spirit and opinions in conformity with the new laws of the empire.\"\r\nAnd this corporation must be secular. Its members are to be State and\r\nnot Church \"Jesuits\";[6129] they must belong to the Emperor and not to\r\nthe Pope, and will form, in the hands of the government, a civil militia\r\ncomposed of \"ten thousand persons,\" administrators and professors of\r\nevery degree, comprehending schoolmasters, an organized, coherent and\r\nlasting militia\r\n\r\nAs it must be secular, there must be no hold on it through dogma\r\nor faith, paradise or hell, no spiritual incitements; consequently,\r\ntemporal means are to be employed, not less effective, when one knows\r\nhow to manage them,--self-esteem, pride, (amour propre), competition,\r\nimagination, ambition, magnificent hopes and vague dreams of unlimited\r\npromotion, in short, the means and motives already maintaining the\r\ntemper and zeal of the army. \"The educational corps must copy the\r\nclassification of military grades; \"an order of promotion,\" a hierarchy\r\nof places is to be instituted; no one will attain superior rank without\r\nhaving passed through the inferior; \"no one can become a principal\r\nwithout having been a teacher, nor professor in the higher classes\r\nwithout having taught in the lower ones.\"--And, on the other hand, the\r\nhighest places will be within reach of all; \"the young, who devoted\r\nthemselves to teaching, will enjoy the perspective of rising from one\r\ngrade to another, up to the highest dignities of the State.\" Authority,\r\nimportance, titles, large salaries, pre-eminence, precedence,--these are\r\nto exist in the University as in other public careers and furnish the\r\nwherewithal for the most magnificent dreams.[6130] \"The feet of this\r\ngreat body[6131] will be on the college benches and its head in the\r\nsenate.\" Its chief, the Grand-Master, unique of his species, less\r\nrestricted, with freer hands than the ministers themselves, is to be one\r\nof the principal personages of the empire; his greatness will exalt the\r\ncondition and feeling of his subordinates. In the provinces, on every\r\nfestive occasion or at every public ceremony, people will take pride in\r\nseeing their rector or principal in official costume seated alongside of\r\nthe general or prefect in full uniform.[6132]\r\n\r\nThe consideration awarded to their chief will reflect on them; they will\r\nenjoy it along with him; they will say to themselves that they too, like\r\nhim and those under him, all together, form an élite; by degrees, they\r\nwill feel that they are all one body; they will acquire the spirit of\r\nthe association and attach themselves to the University, the same as a\r\nsoldier to his regiment or like a monk to his brethren in a monastery.\r\n\r\nThus, as in a monastic order, one must join the University by \"going\r\ninto the orders.\"[6133]--\"I want,\" says Napoleon, \"some solemnity\r\nattached to this act. My purpose is that the members of the corps of\r\ninstruction should contract, not as formerly, a religious engagement,\r\nbut a civil engagement before a notary, or before the justice of the\r\npeace, or prefect, or other (officer).... They will espouse education\r\nthe same as their forerunners espoused the Church, with this difference,\r\nthat the marriage will not be as sacred, as indissoluble.[6134]... They\r\nwill engage themselves for three, six, or nine years, and not resign\r\nwithout giving notice a certain number of years beforehand.\" To heighten\r\nthe resemblance, \"the principle of celibacy must be established, in this\r\nsense, that a man consecrated to teaching shall not marry until after\r\nhaving passed through the first stages of his career; \"for example, \"the\r\nschoolmasters shall not marry before the age of twenty-five or thirty\r\nyears, after having obtained a salary of three or four thousand francs\r\nand economized something.\" But, at bottom, marriage, a family, private\r\nlife, all natural and normal matters in the great world of society, are\r\ncauses of trouble and weakness in a corps where individuals, to be\r\ngood organs, must give themselves up wholly and without reserve. \"In\r\nfuture,[6135] not only must schoolmasters, but, again, the principals\r\nand censors of the lycées, and the principals and rulers of the\r\ncolleges, be restricted to celibacy and a life in common.\"--The\r\nlast complementary and significant trait, which gives to the secular\r\ninstitution the aspect of a convent, is this: \"No woman shall have a\r\nlodging in, or be admitted into, the lycées and colleges.\"\r\n\r\nNow, let us add to the monastic principle of celibacy the monastic and\r\nmilitary principle of obedience; the latter, in Napoleon's eyes, is\r\nfundamental and the basis of the others; this principle being accepted,\r\na veritable corporation exists; members are ruled by one head and\r\ncommand becomes effective.[6136] \"There will be,\" says Napoleon, \"a\r\ncorps of instructors, if all the principals, censors and professors have\r\none or several chiefs, the same as the Jesuits had their general and\r\ntheir provincial,\" like the soldiers of a regiment with their colonel\r\nand captain. The indispensable link is found; individuals, in this way,\r\nkeep together, for they are held by authorities, under one regulation.\r\nAs with a volunteer in a regiment, or a monk who enters a convent,\r\nthe members of the University will accept its total régime in advance,\r\npresent and future, wholly and in detail, and will subject themselves\r\nunder oath. \"They are to take an engagement[6137] to faithfully observe\r\nthe statutes and regulations of the University. They must promise\r\nobedience to the Grand-Master in everything ordered by him for the\r\nservice of the Emperor, and for the advantage of education. They must\r\nengage not to quit the educational corps and abandon their functions\r\nbefore having obtained the Grand-Master's consent. They are to accept\r\nno other public or private salaried function without the authentic\r\npermission of the Grand-Master. They are bound to give notice to the\r\nGrand-Master and his officers of whatever comes to their knowledge that\r\nis opposed to the doctrine and principles of the educational corps\r\nin the establishments for public instruction.\" There are many other\r\nobligations, indefinite or precise,[6138] of which the sanction is\r\nnot only moral, but, again, legal, all notable and lasting, an entire\r\nsurrender of the person who suffers more or less profoundly at having\r\naccepted them, and whose compulsory resignation must be assured by\r\nthe fear of punishment. \"Care must be taken[6139] to insure severe\r\ndiscipline everywhere: the professors themselves are to be subject\r\nin certain cases to the penalty of arrest; they will lose no more\r\nconsideration on this account than the colonels who are punished in the\r\nsame manner.\"[6140] It is the least of all penalties; there are others\r\nof greater and greater gravity,[6141] \"the reprimand in presence of an\r\nacademical board, censure in presence of the University board, transfer\r\nto an inferior office, suspension with or without entire or partial\r\ndeprivation of salary, half-pay or put on the retired list, or stricken\r\noff the University roll,\" and, in the latter case, \"rendered incapable\r\nof obtaining employment in any other public administration.\"--\"Every\r\nmember of the University[6142] who shall fail to conform to the\r\nsubordination established by the statutes and regulations, or in respect\r\ndue to superiors, shall be reprimanded, censured or suspended from\r\nhis functions according to the gravity of the case.\" In no case may he\r\nwithdraw of his own accord, resign at will, and voluntarily return\r\nto private life; he is bound to obtain beforehand the Grand-Master's\r\nassent; and, if the latter refuses this, he must renew his application\r\nthree times, every two months, with the formalities, the delays and\r\nthe importunacy of a long procedure; failing in which, he is not\r\nonly stricken from the rolls, but again \"condemned to a confinement\r\nproportioned to the gravity of the circumstances,\" and which may last a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nA system of things ending in a prison is not attractive, and is\r\nestablished only after great resistance. \"We were under the necessity,\"\r\nsays the superior council,[6143] \"of taking candidates as they could\r\nbe found, differing infinitely in methods, principles and sentiments,\r\naccustomed to almost unlimited pardon or, at least, to being governed by\r\nthe caprices of parents and nearly all disliking the régime attempted to\r\nbe enforced on them.\" Moreover, through this intervention of the State,\r\n\"the local authorities find one of their most cherished prerogatives\r\nwrested from them.\" In sum, \"the masters detested the new duties\r\nimposed on them; the administrators and bishops protested against\r\nthe appointments not made at their suggestion; fathers of families\r\ncomplained of the new taxes they had to pay. It is said that the\r\nUniversity is known only by its imposts and by its forced regulations;\r\nagain, in 1811, most of its masters are incompetent, or intractable, and\r\nof a bad spirit.--There is still another reason for tightening the cord\r\nthat binds them into a corporation. \"The absolute subordination of every\r\nindividual belonging to the University is its first necessity; without\r\ndiscipline and without obedience, no University could exist. This\r\nobedience must be prompt, and, in grave cases, where recourse must\r\nbe had to the authority of the government, obedience must always be\r\nprovisional.\" But, on this incurably refractory staff, pressure is\r\nnot enough; it has grown old and hardened; the true remedy, therefore,\r\nconsists in replacing it with a younger one, more manageable, expressly\r\nshaped and wrought out in a special school, which will be for the\r\nUniversity what Fontainebleau is for the army, what the grand seminaries\r\nare for the clergy, a nursery of subjects carefully selected and\r\nfashioned beforehand.\r\n\r\nSuch is the object of the \"École Normale.\"[6144] Young students enter it\r\nat the age of seventeen and bind themselves to remain in the University\r\nat least ten years.[6145] Young students enter it at the age of\r\nseventeen (for a period of 3 years) and bind themselves afterwards to\r\nremain in the University at least ten years. It is a boarding-school\r\nand they are obliged to live in common: \"individual exits are not\r\nallowed,\" while \"the exits in common... in uniform... can be made only\r\nunder the direction and conduct of superintendent masters.. .. These\r\nsuperintendents inspect the pupils during their studies and recreations,\r\non rising and on going to bed and during the night... No pupil is\r\nallowed to pass the hours set aside for recreation in his own room\r\nwithout permission of the superintendent. No pupil is allowed to\r\nenter the hall of another division without the permission of two\r\nsuperintendents.... The director of studies must examine the books\r\nof the pupils whenever he deems it necessary, and as often as once a\r\nmonth.\" Every hour of the day has its prescribed task; all exercises,\r\nincluding religious observances, are prescribed, each in time and place,\r\nwith a detail and meticulousness, as if purposely to close all possible\r\nissues to personal initiation and everywhere substitute mechanical\r\nuniformity for individual diversities. \"The principal duties of the\r\npupils are respect for religion, attachment to the sovereign and the\r\ngovernment, steady application, constant regularity, docility and\r\nsubmission to superiors; whoever fails in these duties is punished\r\naccording to the gravity of the offense.\"[6146]--In 1812,[6147] the\r\nNormal School is still a small one, scarcely housed, lodged in the upper\r\nstories of the lycée Louis le Grand, and composed of forty pupils and\r\nfour masters. But Napoleon has its eyes on it and is kept informed of\r\nwhat goes on in it. He does not approve of the comments on the \"Dialogue\r\nde Sylla et d'Eucrate,\" by Montesquieu, on the \"Éloge de Marc Aurèle,\"\r\nby Thomas, on the \"Annales\" of Tacitus: \"Let the young read Cæsar's\r\ncommentaries... Corneille, Bossuet, are the masters worth having; these,\r\nunder the full sail of obedience, enter into the established order of\r\nthings of their time; they strengthen it, they illustrate it,\" they\r\nare the literary coadjutors of public authority. Let the spirit of\r\nthe Normal School conform to that of these great men. The University\r\nestablishment is the original, central workshop which forges, finishes\r\nand supplies the finest pieces, the best wheels. Just now the workshop\r\nis incomplete, poorly fitted out, poorly directed and still rudimentary;\r\nbut it is to be enlarged and completed and made to turn out more and\r\nbetter work. For the time being, it produces only what is needed to fill\r\nthe annual vacancies in the lycées and in the colleges. Nevertheless,\r\nthe first decree states that it is \"intended to receive as many as\r\nthree hundred youths.\"[6148] The production of this number will fill\r\nall vacancies, however great they may be, and fill them with products of\r\nsuperior and authentic quality. These human products thus manufactured\r\nby the State in its own shop, these school instruments which the State\r\nstamps with its own mark, the State naturally prefers. It imposes them\r\non its various branches; it puts them by order into its lycées and\r\ncolleges; at last, it accepts no others; not only does it confer on\r\nitself the monopoly of teaching, but again the preparation of the\r\nmasters who teach. In 1813,[6149] a circular announces that \"the number\r\nof places that chance to fall vacant from year to year, in the various\r\nUniversity establishments, sensibly diminishes according as the\r\norganization of the teaching body becomes more complete and regular in\r\nits operation, as order and discipline are established, and as education\r\nbecomes graduated and proportionate to diverse localities. The moment\r\nhas thus arrived for declaring that the Normal School is henceforth the\r\nonly road by which to enter upon the career of public instruction; it\r\nwill suffice for all the needs of the service.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Objects and sentiments.\r\n\r\n     Object of the educational corps and adaptation of youth to\r\n     the established order of things.--Sentiments required of\r\n     children and adults.--Passive acceptance of these rules.\r\n     --Extent and details of school regulations.--Emulation and the\r\n     desire to be at the head.--Constant competition and annual\r\n     distribution of prizes.\r\n\r\nWhat is the object of this service?--Previous to the Revolution, when\r\ndirected by, or under the supervision of, the Church, its great object\r\nwas the maintenance and strengthening of the faith of the young.\r\nSuccessor of the old kings, the new ruler underlines[6150] among \"the\r\nbases of education,\" \"the precepts of the Catholic religion,\" and this\r\nphrase he writes himself with a marked intention; when first drawn\r\nup, the Council of State had written the Christian religion; Napoleon\r\nhimself, in the definitive and public decree, substitutes the narrowest\r\nterm for the broadest.[6151] In this particular, he is politic, taking\r\none step more on the road on which he has entered through the Concordat,\r\ndesiring to conciliate Rome and the French clergy by seeming to give\r\nreligion the highest place.--But it is only a place for show, similar to\r\nthat which he assigns to ecclesiastical dignitaries in public ceremonies\r\nand on the roll of precedence. He does not concern himself with\r\nreanimating or even preserving earnest belief: far from that:\r\n\r\n\"it should be so arranged,\" he says,[6152] \"that young people may be\r\nneither too bigoted nor too incredulous: they should be adapted to the\r\nstate of the nation and of society.\"\r\n\r\nAll that can be demanded of them is external deference, personal\r\nattendance on the ceremonies of worship, a brief prayer in Latin\r\nmuttered in haste at the beginning and end of each lesson,[6153] in\r\nshort, acts like those of raising one's hat or other public marks of\r\nrespect, such as the official attitudes imposed by a government, author\r\nof the Concordat, on its military and civil staff. They likewise, the\r\nlyceans and the collegians, are to belong to it and do already, Napoleon\r\nthus forming his adult staff out of his juvenile staff.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is for himself that he works, for himself alone, and not\r\nat all for the Church whose ascendancy would prejudice his own; much\r\nbetter, in private conversation, he declares that he had wished\r\nto supplant it: his object in forming the University is first and\r\nespecially \"to take education out of the hands of the priests.[6154]\r\nThey consider this world only as a vehicle for transportation to the\r\nother,\" and Napoleon wants \"the vehicle filled with good soldiers for\r\nhis armies,\" good functionaries for his administrations, and good,\r\nzealous subjects for his service.--And, thereupon, in the decree which\r\norganizes the University, and following after this phrase written for\r\neffect, he states the real and fundamental truth.\r\n\r\n\"All the schools belonging to the University shall take for the basis of\r\ntheir teaching loyalty to the Emperor, to the imperial monarchy to which\r\nthe happiness of the people is confided and to the Napoleonic dynasty\r\nwhich preserves the unity of France and of all liberal ideas proclaimed\r\nby the Constitutions.\"\r\n\r\nIn other terms, the object is to plant civil faith in the breasts\r\nof children, boys and young men, to make them believe in the beauty,\r\ngoodness and excellence of the established order of things, to\r\npredispose their minds and hearts in favor of the system, to adapt\r\nthem to this system,[6155] to the concentration of authority and to the\r\ncentralization of services, to uniformity and to \"falling into line\"\r\n(encadrement), to equality in obeying, to competition, to enthusiasm,\r\nin short, to the spirit of the reign, to the combinations of the\r\ncomprehensive and calculating mind which, claiming for itself and\r\nappropriating for its own use the entire field of human action, sets up\r\nits sign-posts everywhere, its barriers, its rectilinear compartments,\r\nlays out and arranges its racecourses, brings together and introduces\r\nthe runners, urges them on, stimulates them at each stage, reduces their\r\nsoul to the fixed determination of getting ahead fast and far, leaving\r\nto the individual but one motive for living, that of the desire to\r\nfigure in the foremost rank in the career where, now by choice and now\r\nthrough force, he finds himself enclosed and launched.[6156]\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, two sentiments are essential with adults and therefore\r\nwith children:\r\n\r\nThe first is the passive acceptance of a prescribed regulation, and\r\nnowhere does a rule applied from above bind and direct the whole life by\r\nsuch precise and multiplied injunctions as under the University régime.\r\nSchool life is circumscribed and marked out according to a rigid,\r\nunique system, the same for all the colleges and lycées of the Empire,\r\naccording to an imperative and detailed plan which foresees and\r\nprescribes everything even to the minutest point, labor and rest of mind\r\nand of body, material and method of instruction, class-books, passages\r\nto translate or to recite, a list of fifteen hundred volumes for each\r\nlibrary with a prohibition against introducing another volume into it\r\nwithout the Grand-Master's permission, hours, duration, application\r\nand sessions of classes, of studies, of recreations and of promenades\r\ncausing the premeditated stifling of native curiosity, of spontaneous\r\ninquiry, of inventive and personal originality, both with the masters\r\nand still more, with the scholars. This to such an extent that one\r\nday, under the second Empire, a minister, drawing out his watch, could\r\nexclaim with satisfaction,\r\n\r\n\"At this very time, in such a class, all the scholars of the Empire are\r\nstudying a certain page in Virgil.\"\r\n\r\nWell--informed, judicious, impartial and even kindly-disposed\r\nforeigners,[6157] on seeing this mechanism which everywhere substitutes\r\nfor the initiative from below the compression and impetus from above,\r\nare very much surprised. \"The law means that the young shall never for\r\none moment be left to themselves; the children are under their masters'\r\neyes all day\" and all night. Every step outside of the regulations is\r\na false one and always arrested by the ever-present authority. And, in\r\ncases of infraction, punishments are severe; \"according to the gravity\r\nof the case,[6158] the pupils will be punished by confinement from three\r\ndays to three months in the lycée or college, in some place assigned to\r\nthat purpose; if fathers, mothers or guardians object to these measures,\r\nthe pupil must be sent home and can no longer enter any other college\r\nor lycée belonging to the university, which, as an effect of university\r\nmonopoly, thereafter deprives him of instruction, unless his parents are\r\nwealthy enough to employ a professor at home. \"Everything that can be\r\neffected by rigid discipline is thus obtained[6159] and better, perhaps,\r\nin France than in any other country,\" for if, on leaving the lycée,\r\nyoung people have lost a will of their own, they have acquired \"a\r\nlove of and habits of subordination and punctuality\" which are lacking\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on this narrow and strictly defined road, whilst the\r\nregulation supports them, emulation pushes them on. In this respect, the\r\nnew university corps, which, according to Napoleon himself, must be a\r\ncompany of \"lay Jesuits,\" resumes to its advantage the double process\r\nwhich its forerunners, the former Jesuits, had so well employed\r\nin education. On the one hand, constant direction and incessant\r\nwatchfulness; on the other hand, the appeal to amour-propre and to the\r\nexcitements of parades before the public. If the pupil works hard, it is\r\nnot for the purpose of learning and knowing, but to be the first in his\r\nclass; the object is not to develop in him the need of truthfulness and\r\nthe love of knowledge, but his memory, taste and literary talent; at\r\nbest, the logical faculty of arrangement and deduction, but especially\r\nthe desire to surpass his rivals, to distinguish himself, to shine, at\r\nfirst in the little public of his companions, and next, at the end of\r\nthe year, before the great public of grown-up men. Hence, the weekly\r\ncompositions, the register of ranks and names, every place being\r\nnumbered and proclaimed; hence, those annual and solemn awards of prizes\r\nin each lycée and at the grand competition of all lycées, along with\r\nthe pomp, music, decoration, speeches and attendance of distinguished\r\npersonages. The German observer testifies to the powerful effect of a\r\nceremony of this kind[6160]:\r\n\r\n\"One might think one's self at the play, so theatrical was it;\"\r\n\r\nand he notices the oratorical tone of the speakers, \"the fire of their\r\ndeclamation,\" the communication of emotion, the applause of the public,\r\nthe prolonged shouts, the ardent expression of the pupils obtaining the\r\nprizes, their sparkling eyes, their blushes, the joy and the tears of\r\nthe parents. Undoubtedly, the system has its defects; very few of the\r\npupils can expect to obtain the first place; others lack the spur and\r\nare moreover neglected by the master. But the élite make extraordinary\r\nefforts and, with this, there is success. \"During the war times,\" says\r\nagain another German, \"I lodged a good many French officers who knew one\r\nhalf of Virgil and Horace by heart.\" Similarly, in mathematics, young\r\npeople of eighteen, pupils of the Polytechnic School, understand very\r\nwell the differential and integral calculus, and, according to the\r\ntestimony of an Englishman,[6161] \"they know it better than many of the\r\nEnglish professors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Military preparation and the cult of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThis general preparation is specified and directed by Napoleon as a\r\npolicy, and, as he specially needs soldiers, the school, in his hands,\r\nbecomes the vestibule of the barracks. Right away the institution\r\nreceived a military turn and spirit, and this form, which is essential\r\nto him, becomes more and more restricted. In 1805, during four\r\nmonths,[6162] Fourcroy, ordered by the Emperor, visits the new lycées\r\n\"with an inspector of reviews and a captain or adjutant-major, who\r\neverywhere gives instruction in drill and discipline.\" The young have\r\nbeen already broke in; \"almost everywhere,\" he says on his return, \"I\r\nsaw young people without a murmur or reflection obey even younger and\r\nweaker corporals and sergeants who had been raised to a merited rank\r\nthrough their good behavior and progress. He himself, although a\r\nliberal, finds reasons which justify to the legislative body this\r\nunpopular practice;[6163] he replies to the objections and alarm of the\r\nparents \"that it is favorable to order, without which there are no good\r\nstudies,\" and moreover \"it accustoms the pupils to carrying and using\r\narms, which shortens their work and accelerates their promotion on being\r\nsummoned by the conscription to the service of the State.\" The tap of\r\nthe drum, the attitude in presenting arms, marching at command, uniform,\r\ngold lace, and all that, in 1811, becomes obligatory, not only for the\r\nlycées and colleges, but again, and under the penalty of being closed,\r\nfor private institutions.[6164] At the end of the Empire, there were in\r\nthe departments which composed old France 76,000 scholars studying under\r\nthis system of stimulation and constraint. \"Our masters,\" as a\r\nformer pupil is to say later on, \"resembled captain-instructors, our\r\nstudy-rooms mess--rooms, our recreations drills, and our examinations\r\nreviews.\"[6165] The whole tendency of the school inclines it towards the\r\nmilitary and merges therein on the studies being completed--sometimes,\r\neven, it flows into it before the term is over. After 1806,[6166] the\r\nanticipated conscriptions take youths from the benches of the philosophy\r\nand rhetoric classes. After 1808, ministerial circulars[6167] demand of\r\nthe lycées boys (des enfants de bonne volonté), scholars of eighteen and\r\nnineteen who \"know how to manoeuvre,\" so that they may at once be made\r\nunder-officers or second-lieutenants; and these the lycées furnish\r\nwithout any difficulty by hundreds. In this way, the beardless volunteer\r\nentering upon the career one or two years sooner, but gaining by this\r\none or two grades in rank.--\"Thus,\" says a principal[6168] of one of the\r\ncolleges, \"the brain of the French boy is full of the soldier. As far as\r\nknowledge goes there is but little hope of it, at least under existing\r\ncircumstances. In the schools, says another witness of the reign,[6169]\r\n\"the young refuse to learn anything but mathematics and a knowledge of\r\narms. I can recall many examples of young lads of ten or twelve\r\nyears who daily entreated their father and mother to let them go with\r\nNapoleon.\"--In those days, the military profession is evidently the\r\nfirst of all, almost the only one. Every civilian is a pékin, that is\r\nto say an inferior, and is treated as such.[6170] At the door of the\r\ntheatre, the officer breaks the line of those who are waiting to get\r\ntheir tickets and, as a right, takes one under the nose of those who\r\ncame before him; they let him pass, go in, and they wait. In the café,\r\nwhere the newspapers are read in common, he lays hold of them as if\r\nthrough a requisition and uses them as he pleases in the face of the\r\npatient bourgeois.\r\n\r\nThe central idea of this glorification of the army, be it understood, is\r\nthe worship of Napoleon, the supreme, unique, absolute sovereign of the\r\narmy and all the rest, while the prestige of this name is as great, as\r\ncarefully maintained, in the school as in the army. At the start, he put\r\nhis own free scholars (boursiers) into the lycées and colleges, about\r\n3000 boys[6171] whom he supports and brings up at his own expense, for\r\nhis own advantage, destined to become his creatures, and who form the\r\nuppermost layer of the school population; about one hundred and fifty of\r\nthese scholarships to each lycée, first occupants of the lycée and still\r\nfor a long time more numerous than their paying comrades, all of a more\r\nor less needy family, sons of soldiers and functionaries who live on the\r\nEmperor and rely on him only, all accustomed from infancy to regard\r\nthe Emperor as the arbiter of their destiny, the special, generous and\r\nall-powerful patron who, having taken charge of them now, will also take\r\ncharge of them in the future. A figure of this kind fills and occupies\r\nthe entire field of their imagination; whatever grandeur it already\r\npossesses it here becomes still more grand, colossal and superhuman.\r\nAt the beginning their enthusiasm gave the pitch to their\r\nco-disciples;[6172] the institution, through its mechanism, labors to\r\nkeep this up, and the administrators or professors, by order or through\r\nzeal, use all their efforts to make the sonorous and ringing chord\r\nvibrate with all the more energy. After 1811, even in a private\r\ninstitution,[6173] \"the victories of the Emperor form almost the only\r\nsubject on which the imagination of the pupils is allowed to exercise\r\nitself.\" After 1807,[6174] at Louis le Grand, the prize compositions\r\nare those on the recent victory of Jena. \"Our masters themselves,\" says\r\nAlfred de Vigny, \"unceasingly read to us the bulletins of the Grande\r\nArmée, while cries of Vive l'Empereur interrupted Virgil and Plato.\" In\r\nsum, write many witnesses,[6175] Bonaparte desired to bestow on French\r\nyouths the organization of the \"Mamelukes,\" and he nearly succeeded.\r\nMore exactly and in his own words, \"His Majesty[6176] desired to realize\r\nin a State of forty millions of inhabitants what had been done in Sparta\r\nand in Athens.--\" But,\" he is to say later, \"I only half succeeded.\r\nThat was one of my finest conceptions\";[6177] M. de Fontanes and the\r\nother university men did not comprehend this or want to comprehend it.\r\nNapoleon himself could give only a moment of attention to his school\r\nwork, his halting-spells between two campaigns;[6178] in his absence,\r\n\"they spoiled for him his best ideas\"; \"his executants \"never perfectly\r\ncarried out his intentions. \"He scolded, and they bowed to the storm,\r\nbut not the less continued on in the usual way.\" Fourcroy kept too much\r\nof the Revolution in mind, and Fontanes too much of the ancient régime;\r\nthe former was too much a man of science, and the latter too much a\r\nman of letters; with such capacities they laid too great stress on\r\nintellectual culture and too little on discipline of the feelings. In\r\neducation, literature and science are \"secondary\" matters; the essential\r\nthing is training, an early, methodical, prolonged, irresistible\r\ntraining which, through the convergence of every means--lessons,\r\nexamples and habits--inculcates \"principles,\" and lastingly impresses\r\non young souls \"the national doctrine,\" a sort of social and political\r\ncatechism, the first article of which commands fanatical docility,\r\npassionate devotion, and the total surrender of one's self to the\r\nEmperor.[6179]\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6101: (and obviously the aim of all other dictatorships.\r\n(SR.))]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6102: Pelet de la Lozère, 161.

Primary Instruction.\r\n\r\n     Primary instruction.--Additional and special restrictions on\r\n     the teacher.--Ecclesiastical supervision.--Napoleon's\r\n     motives.--Limitation of primary instruction.--Ignorant\r\n     monks preferred.--The imperial catechism.\r\n\r\nSuch is secondary education, his most personal, most elaborate, most\r\ncomplete work; the other two stories of the educational system, under\r\nand over, built in a more summary fashion, are adapted to the middle\r\nstory and form, the three together, a regular monument, of which the\r\narchitect has skillfully balanced the proportions, distributed the\r\nrooms, calculated the service and designed the facade and scenic effect.\r\n\r\n\"Napoleon,\" says a contemporary adversary,[6201] \"familiar with power\r\nonly in its most absolute form, military despotism, tried to partition\r\nFrance in two categories, one composed of the masses, destined to fill\r\nthe ranks of his vast army, and disposed, through the brutishness which\r\nhe was willing to maintain; to passive obedience and fanatical devotion;\r\nthe other, more refined by reason of its wealth, was to lead the former\r\naccording to the views of the chief who equally dominated both, for\r\nwhich purpose it was to be formed in schools where, trained for a\r\nservile and, so to say, mechanical submission, it would acquire relative\r\nknowledge, especially in the art of war and with regard to a wholly\r\nmaterial administration; after this, vanity and self-interest were to\r\nattach it to his person and identify it, in some way with his system of\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nLighten this gloomy picture one degree and it is true.[6202] As to\r\nprimary instruction, there was no State appropriation, no credit\r\ninscribed on the budget, no aid in money, save 25,000 francs, allotted\r\nin 1812, to the novices of the Frères Ignorantins and of which they\r\nreceived but 4,500 francs;[6203] the sole mark of favor accorded to the\r\nsmall schools is an exemption from the dues of the University.[6204] His\r\ncouncillors, with their habits of fiscal logic, proposed to exact\r\nthis tax here as elsewhere; a shrewd politician, he thinks that its\r\ncollection would prove odious and he is bound not to let his popularity\r\nsuffer among villagers and common people; it is 200,000 francs a year\r\nwhich he abstains from taking from them; but here his liberalities in\r\nbehalf of primary instruction stop. Let parents and the communes take\r\nthis burden on themselves, pay its expenses, seek out and hire the\r\nteacher, and provide for a necessity which is local and almost domestic.\r\nThe government, which invites them to do this, will simply furnish the\r\nplan, that is to say, a set of rules, prescriptions and restrictions.\r\n\r\nAt first, there is the authorization of the prefect, guardian of the\r\ncommune, who, having invited the commune to found a school, has\r\nhimself, through a circular, given instructions to this end, and who\r\nnow interferes in the contract between the municipal council and the\r\nteacher, to approve of or to rectify its clauses--the name of the\r\nemployee, duration of his engagement, hours and seasons for his classes,\r\nsubjects to be taught, the sum total and conditions of his pay in money\r\nor in kind; the school grant must be paid by the commune, the school\r\ntax by the pupils, the petty fees which help pay the teacher's living\r\nexpenses and which he gets from accessory offices such as mayor's clerk,\r\nclock-winder, sexton, bell-ringer and chorister in the church[6205]--At\r\nthe same time, and in addition, there is the authorization of the\r\nrector; for the small as well as the average or larger schools are\r\nincluded in the University;[6206] the new master becomes a member of\r\nthe teaching body, binds himself and belongs to it by oath, takes\r\nupon himself its obligations and submissions, comes under the special\r\njurisdiction of the university authorities, and is inspected, directed\r\nand controlled by them in his class and outside of his class.--The\r\nlast supervision, still more searching and active, which close by,\r\nincessantly and on the spot, hovers over all small schools by order\r\nand spontaneously, is the ecclesiastical supervision. A circular of the\r\nGrand-Master, M. de Fontanes,[6207] requests the bishops to instruct\r\n\"messieurs les curés of their diocese to send in detailed notes on their\r\nparish schoolmasters;\" \"when these notes are returned,\" he says,\r\n\"please address them to me with your remarks on them; according to these\r\nindications I will approve of the instructor who merits your suffrage\r\nand he will receive the diploma authorizing him to continue in his\r\nfunctions. Whoever fails to present these guarantees will not receive a\r\ndiploma and I shall take care to replace him with another man whom you\r\nmay judge to be the most capable.\"[6208]\r\n\r\nIf Napoleon thus places his small schools under ecclesiastical\r\noversight, it is not merely to conciliate the clergy by giving it the\r\nlead of the majority of souls, all the uncultivated souls, but because,\r\nfor his own interests, he does not want the mass of the people to think\r\nand reason too much for themselves.\r\n\r\n\"The Academy inspectors,\"[6209] says the decree of 1811, \"will see that\r\nthe masters of the primary schools do not carry their teaching beyond\r\nreading, writing and arithmetic.\"\r\n\r\nBeyond this limit, should the instructor teach a few of the children the\r\nfirst elements of Latin or geometry, geography or history, his school\r\nbecomes secondary; it is then ranked as a boarding-school, while its\r\npupils are subjected to the university recompense, military drill,\r\nuniform, and all the above specified exigencies; and yet more--it must\r\nno longer exist and is officially closed. A peasant who reads, writes\r\nand ciphers and who remains a peasant need know no more, and, to be a\r\ngood soldier, he need not know as much; moreover, that is enough, and\r\nmore too, to enable him to become an under and even a superior officer.\r\nTake, for instance, Captain Coignet, whose memoirs we have, who, to be\r\nappointed a second-lieutenant, had to learn to write and who could never\r\nwrite other than a large hand, like young beginners.--The best masters\r\nfor such limited instruction are the Brethren of the Christian Schools\r\nand these, against the advice of his counselors, Napoleon supports:\r\n\r\n\"If they are obliged,\" he says, by their vows to refrain from other\r\nknowledge than reading, writing and the elements of arithmetic,... it is\r\nthat they may be better adapted to their destiny.\"[6210] \"In comprising\r\nthem in the University, they become connected with the civil order of\r\nthings and the danger of their independence is anticipated.\"\r\n\r\nHenceforth, \"they no longer have a stranger or a foreigner for their\r\nchief.\" \"The superior-general at Rome has renounced all inspection over\r\nthem; it is understood that in France their superior-general will reside\r\nat Lyons.\"[6211] The latter, with his monks, fall into the hands of\r\nthe government and come under the authority of the Grand-Master. Such\r\na corporation, with the head of it in one's power, is a perfect\r\ninstrument, the surest, the most exact, always to be relied on and which\r\nnever acts on one side of, or beyond, the limits marked out for it.\r\nNothing pleases Napoleon more, who,\r\n\r\n* in the civil order of things, wants to be Pope;\r\n\r\n* who builds up his State, as the Pope his Church, on old Roman\r\ntradition;\r\n\r\n* who, to govern from above, allies himself with ecclesiastical\r\nauthority;\r\n\r\n* who, like Catholic authorities, requires drilled executants and\r\nregimental maneuvers, only to be found in organized and special bodies\r\nof men.[6212]\r\n\r\nThe general inspectors of the University give to each rector the\r\nfollowing instructions as a watchword \"Wherever the Brethren of the\r\nChristian Schools can be found, they shall,\" for primary teaching, \"be\r\npreferred to all others.\"[6213] Thus, to the three classes of subjects\r\ntaught, a fourth must be added, one not mentioned by the legislator\r\nin his law, but which Napoleon admits, which the rectors and prefects\r\nrecommend or authorize, and which is always inscribed in the contract\r\nmade between the commune and the instructor. The latter, whether layman\r\nor 'frère ignorantin,' engages to teach, besides \"reading, writing\r\nand decimal arithmetic,\" \"the catechism adopted by the Empire.\"\r\nConsequently, as the first communion (of the pupil) draws near, he\r\nis careful, for at least two years, to have his scholars learn the\r\nconsecrated text by heart, and to recite this text aloud on their\r\nbenches, article by article; in this way, his school becomes a branch of\r\nthe Church and, hence, like the Church, a reigning instrumentality. For,\r\nin the catechism adopted for the Empire, there is one phrase carefully\r\nthought out, full and precise in its meaning, in which Napoleon has\r\nconcentrated the quintessence of his political and social doctrine\r\nand formulated the imperative belief assigned by him as the object of\r\neducation. The seven or eight hundred thousand children of the lower\r\nschools recite this potent phrase to the teacher before reciting it to\r\nthe priest:\r\n\r\n\"We especially owe to Napoleon I., our Emperor, love, respect,\r\nobedience, fidelity, military service, and the dues (tributs) prescribed\r\nfor the preservation and defense of the Empire and the throne.... For it\r\nis he whom God has raised up in times of difficulty, to restore\r\npublic worship and the holy religion of our forefathers, and to be its\r\nprotector.\"[6214]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Higher Education.\r\n\r\n     Superior instruction.--Characters and conditions of\r\n     scientific universities.--Motives for opposition to them.\r\n     --In what respect adverse to the French system.--How he\r\n     replaces them.--Extent of secondary instruction.--Meets all\r\n     wants in the new social order of things.--The careers it\r\n     leads to.--Special schools.--Napoleon requires them\r\n     professional and practical.--The law school.\r\n\r\nSuperior instruction, the most important of all, remains. For, in this\r\nthird and last stage of education, the minds and opinions of young\r\npeople from eighteen to twenty-four years of age are fully formed. It is\r\nthen that, already free and nearly ripe, these future occupants of busy\r\ncareers, just entering into practical life, shape their first general\r\nideas, their still hazy and half-poetic views of things, their premature\r\nand foregone conclusions respecting man, nature, society and the great\r\ninterests of humanity.\r\n\r\nIf we want them to arrive at sound conclusions, a good many scales must\r\nbe prepared for them, and these scales must be substantial, convergent,\r\neach with its own rungs of the ladder superposed, each with an\r\nindication of its total scope, each expressly designating the absent,\r\ndoubtful, provisional or simply future and possible rungs, because they\r\nare in course of formation or on trial.[6215]--Consequently, these must\r\nall be got together in a designated place, in adjacent buildings,\r\nnot alone the body of professors, the spokes-men of science,\r\nbut collections, laboratories and libraries which constitute the\r\ninstruments. Moreover, besides ordinary and regular courses of\r\nlectures, there must be lecture halls where, at appointed hours, every\r\nenterprising, knowledgeable person with something to say may speak to\r\nthose who would like to listen. Thus, a sort of oral encyclopedia is\r\norganized, an universal exposition of human knowledge, a permanent\r\nexposition constantly renewed and open, to which its visitors, provided\r\nwith a certificate of average instruction as an entrance ticket, will\r\nsee with their own eyes, besides established science that which is under\r\nof formation, besides discoveries and proofs the way of discovering and\r\nproving, namely the method, history and general progress, the place of\r\neach science in its group, and of this group its place in the general\r\nwhole. Owing to the extreme diversity of subjects taught there will be\r\nroom and occupation for the extreme diversity of intelligences. Young\r\nminds can choose for themselves their own career, mount as high as their\r\nstrength allows, climb up the tree of knowledge each on his own side,\r\nwith his own ladder, in his own way, now passing from the branches to\r\nthe trunk and again from the trunk to the branches, now from a remote\r\nbough to the principal branch and from that again back to the trunk.\r\n\r\nAnd more than this, thanks to the co-ordination of lessons well\r\nclassified, there is, for each course of lectures, the means for\r\narriving at full details in all particulars; the young students can\r\ntalk amongst themselves and learn from each other, the student of moral\r\nscience from the student of the natural sciences, the latter from the\r\nstudent of the chemical or physical sciences, and another from the\r\nstudent of the mathematical sciences. Bearing still better fruit, the\r\nstudent, in each of these four circumscriptions, derives information\r\nfrom his co-disciples lodged right and left in the nearest compartments,\r\nthe jurist from the historian, from the economist, from the philologist,\r\nand reciprocally, in such a way as to profit by their impressions and\r\nsuggestions, and enable them to profit by his. He must have no other\r\nobject in view for three years, no rank to obtain, no examination to\r\nundergo, no competition for which to make preparations, no outward\r\npressure, no collateral preoccupation, no positive, urgent and personal\r\ninterest to interfere with, turn aside or stifle pure curiosity. He pays\r\nsomething out of his own pocket for each course of lectures he attends;\r\nfor this reason, he makes the best choice he can, follows it up to the\r\nend, takes notes, and comes there, not to seek phrases and distraction,\r\nbut actualities and instruction, and get full value for his money. It is\r\nassumed that knowledge is an object of exchange, foodstuffs stockpiled\r\nand delivered by the masters; the student who takes delivery is\r\nconcerned that it is of superior quality, genuine and nutritious;\r\nthe masters, undoubtedly, through amour-propre and conscience, try to\r\nfurnish it this; but it is up to the student himself to fetch it, just\r\nwhat he wants, in this particular storehouse rather than in others, from\r\nthis or that lecture-stand, official or not. To impart and to acquire\r\nknowledge for itself and for it alone, without subordinating this end\r\nto another distinct and predominant end, to direct minds towards this\r\nobject and in this way, under the promptings and restraints of supply\r\nand demand, to open up the largest field and the freest career to the\r\nfaculties, to labor, to the preferences of the thinking individual,\r\nmaster or disciple,--such is (or ought to be) the spirit of the\r\ninstitution. And, evidently, in order that it may be effective according\r\nto this spirit, it needs an independent, appropriate body, that is to\r\nsay, autonomous, sheltered against the interference of the State, of\r\nthe Church, of the commune, of the province, and of all general or\r\nlocal powers, provided with rules and regulations, made a legal, civil\r\npersonage, with the right to buy, sell and contract obligations, in\r\nshort proprietorship.\r\n\r\nThis is no chimerical plan, the work of a speculative, calculating\r\nimagination, which appears well and remains on paper. All the\r\nuniversities of the middle ages were organized according to this type.\r\nIt found life and activity everywhere and for a long time; the twenty-\r\ntwo universities in France previous to the Revolution, although\r\ndisfigured, stunted and desiccated, preserved many of its features,\r\ncertain visible externals, and, in 1811,[6216] Cuvier, who had just\r\ninspected the universities of lower Germany, describes it as he found\r\nit, on the spot, confined to superior instruction, but finished and\r\ncomplete, adapted to modern requirements, in full vigor and in full\r\nbloom.\r\n\r\nThere is no room in the France to which Cuvier returns for institutions\r\nof this stamp; they are excluded from it by the social system which has\r\nprevailed.--First of all, public law, as the Revolution and Napoleon\r\ncomprehended it and enacted it, is hostile to them;[6217] for it sets\r\nup the principle that in a State there must be no special corporations\r\npermanent, under their own control, supported by mort main property,\r\nacting in their own right and conducting a public service for their own\r\nbenefit, especially if this service is that of teaching; for the State\r\nhas taken this charge upon itself, reserved it for itself and assumed\r\nthe monopoly of it; hence, the unique and comprehensive university\r\nfounded by it, and which excludes free, local and numerous universities.\r\nThus, in its essence, it is the self-teaching State and not\r\nself-teaching science; thus defined, the two types are contradictory;\r\nnot only are the two bodies different, but again the two spirits are\r\nincompatible; each has an aim of its own, which is not the aim of the\r\nother. In a special sense, the use to which the Emperor assigns his\r\nuniversity is contrary to the aim of the German universities; it is\r\nfounded for his own advantage, that he may possess \"the means for\r\nshaping moral and political opinions.\" With this object in view it\r\nwould be wrong for him to allow several establishments within reach of\r\nstudents in which they would be directed by science alone; it is certain\r\nthat, in many points, the direction here given to youth would poorly\r\nsquare with the rigid, uniform, narrow lines in which Napoleon wishes\r\nto confine them. Schools of this kind would get to be centers of\r\nopposition; young men thus fashioned would become dissenters; they would\r\ngladly hold personal, independent opinions alongside, or outside, of\r\n\"the national doctrine,\" outside of Napoleonic and civil orthodoxy;\r\nand worse still, they would believe in their opinions. Having studied\r\nseriously and at first sources, the jurist, the theologian, the\r\nphilosopher, the historian, the philologist, the economist might perhaps\r\ncherish the dangerous pretension of considering himself competent even\r\nin social matters; being a Frenchman, he would talk with assurance and\r\nindiscretion; he would be much more troublesome than a German; it would\r\nsoon be necessary to send him to Bicêtre or to the Temple.[6218]--In\r\nthe present state of things, with the exigencies of the reign, and even\r\nin the interests of the young themselves, it is essential that superior\r\ninstruction should be neither encyclopedic nor very profound.\r\n\r\nWere this a defect, Frenchmen would not perceive it; they are accustomed\r\nto it. Already, before 1789, the classes in the humanities were\r\ngenerally completed by the lesson in philosophy. In this course logic,\r\nmorals and metaphysics were taught. Here the young persons handled,\r\nadjusted, and knocked about more or less adroitly the formula on God,\r\nnature, the soul and science they had learned by rote. Less scholastic,\r\nabridged, and made easy, this verbal exercise has been maintained in\r\nthe lycées.[6219] Under the new régime, as well as under the old one, a\r\nstring of abstract terms, which the professor thought he could explain\r\nand which the pupil thought he understood, involves young minds in a\r\nmaze of high, speculative conceptions, beyond their reach and far beyond\r\ntheir experience, education and years. Because pupils play with words,\r\nthey suppose that they grasp and master ideas, which fancy deprives\r\nthem of any desire to obtain them. Consequently, in the great French\r\nestablishment, young people hardly remark the lack of veritable\r\nUniversities; a liberal, broad spirit of inquiry is not aroused in them;\r\nthey do not regret their inability to have covered the cycle of varied\r\nresearch and critical investigation, the long and painful road which\r\nalone surely leads to profound general conceptions, those grand ideas\r\nwhich are verifiable and solidly based.--And, on the other hand,\r\ntheir quick, summary mode of preparation suffices for the positive and\r\nappreciable needs of the new society. The problem is to fill the gaps\r\nmade in it by the Revolution and to provide the annual and indispensable\r\nquota of educated youth. Now, after as before the Revolution, this is\r\nunderstood as being all who have passed through the entire series\r\nof classes; under the system, subject to the drill in Latin and\r\nmathematics. The young men have here acquired the habit of using clear,\r\nconnected ideas, a taste for close reasoning, the art of condensing a\r\nphrase or a paragraph, an aptitude for attending to the daily business\r\nof a worldly, civil life, especially the faculty of carrying on a\r\ndiscussion, of writing a good letter, even the talent for composing\r\na good report or memorial.[6220] A young man with these skills,\r\nsome scraps of natural philosophy, and with still briefer notions of\r\ngeography and history, has all the general, preliminary culture he\r\nneeds, all the information he requires for aspiring to one of the\r\ncareers called liberal. The choice rests with himself; he will be\r\nwhat he wants to be, or what he is able to be--professor, engineer,\r\nphysician, member of the bar, an administrator or a functionary. In each\r\nof his qualifications he renders an important service to the public, he\r\nexercises an honorable profession; let him be competent and expert, that\r\nconcerns society. But that alone is all that society cares about; it is\r\nnot essential that it should find in him additionally an erudite or a\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\n* Let him be competent and worthy of confidence in his particular\r\nprofession,\r\n\r\n* let him know how to teach classes or frame a course of lectures, how\r\nto build a bridge, a bastion, an edifice, how to cure a disease, perform\r\nan amputation, draw up a contract, manage a case in court, and give\r\njudgment;\r\n\r\n* let the State, for greater public convenience, organize, check, and\r\ncertify this special capacity,\r\n\r\n* let it verify this by examinations and diploma,\r\n\r\n* let it make of this a sort of coin of current value, duly minted and\r\nof proper standard;\r\n\r\n* let this be protected against counterfeits, not only by its\r\npreferences but again by its prohibitions, by the penalties it enacts\r\nagainst the illegal practice of pharmacy and of medicine, by the\r\nobligations it imposes on magistrates, lawyers and ministerial officials\r\nnot to act until obtaining this or that grade,--\r\n\r\nsuch is what the interest of society demands and what it may exact.\r\nAccording to this principle, the State creates special schools, (today\r\nin 1998 called Grande Ecoles[6221]), and, through the indirect monopoly\r\nwhich it possesses, it fills them with listeners; henceforth, these are\r\nto furnish the youth of France with superior education.[6222]\r\n\r\nFrom the start, Napoleon, as logician, with his usual lucidity and\r\nprecision, lays it down that they shall be strictly practical and\r\nprofessional. \"Make professors (régents) for me,\" said he one day\r\nin connection with the Ecole normale, \"and not littérateurs, wits or\r\nseekers or inventors in any branch of knowledge.\" In like manner says he\r\nagain,[6223]\r\n\r\n\"I do not approve of the regulation requiring a man to be bachelor\r\n(bachelier) in the sciences before he can be a bachelor in the medical\r\nfaculty; medicine is not an exact and positive science, but a science\r\nof guess and observation. I should place more confidence in a doctor\r\nwho had not studied the exact sciences than in one who possessed them.\r\nI preferred M. Corvisart to M. Hallé, because M. Hallé belongs to the\r\nInstitute. M. Corvisart does not even know what two equal triangles are.\r\nThe medical student should not be diverted from hospital practice, from\r\ndissections and studies relating to his trade.\"\r\n\r\nThere is the same subordination of science to the professions, the same\r\nconcern for immediate or near application, the same utilitarian tendency\r\nto aim at a public function or a private career, the same contraction of\r\nstudies in the law school, in that order of truths of which Montesquieu,\r\na Frenchman, fifty years before, had first seized the entire body,\r\nmarked the connections and delineated the chart. At issue are the laws\r\nand the \"spirit of laws,\" unwritten or written, by which diverse human\r\nsocieties live, of whatever form, extent and kind,--the State, commune,\r\nChurch, school, army, agricultural or industrial workshop, tribe\r\nor family. These, existing or fossilized, are realities, open to\r\nobservation like plants or animals. One may, the same as with animals\r\nand plants, observe them, describe them, compare them together, follow\r\ntheir history from first to last, study their organization, classify\r\nthem in natural groups, disengage the distinctive and dominant\r\ncharacteristics in each, note its ambient surroundings and ascertain\r\nthe internal or external conditions, or \"necessary relationships,\" which\r\ndetermine its failure or its bloom. For men who live together in society\r\nand in a State, no study is so important; it alone can furnish them with\r\na clear, demonstrable idea of what society and the State are; and it is\r\nin the law schools that this capital idea must be sought by an educated\r\nstudent body. If they do not find it there, they invent one to suit\r\nthemselves. As 1789 drew near, the antiquated, poor, barren, teaching\r\nof law, fallen into contempt and almost null,[6224] offered no sound,\r\naccredited doctrine which could impose itself on young minds, fill their\r\nempty minds and prevent the intrusion of utopic dreams. And intrude it\r\ndid: in the shape of Rousseau's anti-social Utopia, in his anarchical\r\nand despotic Social Contract. To hinder it from returning, the best\r\nthing to do was not to repeat the same mistake, not to leave the lodging\r\nempty, to install in it a fixed occupant beforehand, and to see that\r\nthis fixed occupant, which is science, may at all times represent its\r\ntitle of legitimate proprietor, its method analogous to that of the\r\nnatural sciences, its studies of detail from life and in the texts, its\r\nrestricted inductions, its concordant verifications, its progressive\r\ndiscoveries. This in order that, confronting every chance system and\r\nwithout these titles, minds may of themselves shut their doors, or only\r\nopen them provisionally, and always with a care to make the intruder\r\npresent his letters of credit: here we have the social service rendered\r\nby the instruction in Law as given in the German mode, as Cuvier had\r\njust described it. Before 1789, in the University of Strasbourg, in\r\nFrance, it was thus given; but, in this condition and to this extent, it\r\nis not suitable under the new régime, and still less than under the old\r\none.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, in his preparation of jurists, wants executants and not\r\ncritics; his faculties must furnish him with men able to apply and not\r\nto give opinions on his laws. Hence, in the teaching of the law, as he\r\nprescribes it, there must be nothing of history, of political economy or\r\nof comparative law; there must be no exposition of foreign legislation,\r\nof feudal or custom law, or of canon law; no account of the\r\ntransformations which governed public and private law in Rome down to\r\nthe Digest[6225] and, after that, in France, down to the recent codes.\r\nBut nothing on remote origins, on successive forms and the diverse and\r\never-changing conditions of labor, property and the family; nothing\r\nwhich, through the law, exposes to view and brings us in contact with\r\nthe social body to which it is applied. That is to say, this or that\r\nactive and human group, with its habits, prejudices, instincts, dangers\r\nand necessities; nothing but two dry, rigid codes, like two aerolites\r\nfallen from the sky ready-made and all of a piece at an interval\r\nof fourteen centuries. At first, the Institutes,[6226] \"by cutting\r\nout[6227] what is not applicable to our legislation and replacing these\r\nmatters by a comparison with much finer laws scattered through other\r\nbooks of Roman law,\" similar to the classes in the humanities, where\r\nLatin literature is reduced to the finest passages of the classic\r\nauthors. Next, the French code, with the comments on it due to the\r\ndecisions of the court of appeals and the court of cassation.[6228] All\r\nthe courses of lectures of the school shall be obligatory and arranged\r\nas a whole, or tacked on to each other in a compulsory order; each step\r\nthe student takes shall be counted, measured and verified every three\r\nmonths by a certificate, and each year by an examination; at these\r\nexaminations there shall be no optional matters, no estimate of\r\ncollateral studies or those of complimentary or superior importance.\r\nThe student finds no attraction or benefit in studies outside of\r\nthe programme, and, in this programme he finds only official texts,\r\nexplained by the bill of fare, one by one, with subtlety, and patched\r\ntogether as well as may be by means of distinctions and interpretations,\r\nso as to provide the understood solution in ordinary cases and a\r\nplausible solution in disputed cases, in other terms, a system of\r\ncasuistry.[6229]\r\n\r\nAnd this is just the education which suits the future practitioner. As\r\na celebrated professor of the second Empire says,[6230] \"our young\r\ngraduates need a system of instruction which enables them to pass\r\nwithout perplexity or discouragement from the school to the halls of\r\njustice;\" to have the 2281 articles of the civil code at their fingers'\r\nends, also the rest, hundreds and thousands of them, of the other four\r\ncodes; to find at once in relation to each case the set of pertinent\r\narticles, the general rule, neither too broad nor too narrow, which fits\r\nthe particular case in question. As for law taken in itself and as a\r\nwhole, they have none of that clear, full conception of it to which a\r\ncomprehensive and curious mind aspires. \"I know nothing of the civil\r\ncode,\" said another professor, older and in closer proximity with the\r\nprimitive institution, \"I teach only the Code Napoléon.\" Accordingly,\r\nwith his clear-sightedness and his practical and graphic imagination,\r\nNapoleon could perceive in advance the future and certain products of\r\nhis machine, the magistrates in their bonnets, seated or standing in\r\ntheir court-rooms, with the lawyers in their robes facing them pleading,\r\nand, farther on, the great consumers of stamped papers in their bureaus\r\nencumbered with files of documents with the attorneys and notaries\r\nengaged in drawing them up; elsewhere, prefects, sub-prefects, prefect\r\ncouncilors, government commissioners and other officials, all at work\r\nand doing pretty well, all of them useful organs but mere organs of the\r\nlaw. The chances were small, fewer than under the ancient régime, for\r\nan erudite and independent thinker, a Montesquieu, to issue from that\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. On Science, Reason and Truth.\r\n\r\n     Crowning point of the university edifice.--Faith based on\r\n     criticism.--How it binds men together and forms a lay\r\n     Church.--Social power of this Church.--Scientific and\r\n     literary authorities.--How Napoleon enrolls them.--The\r\n     Institute, an appendage of the State.\r\n\r\nEverywhere else, the direction and reach of superior instruction are\r\nsimilar. In the Faculties of Science and Literature, much more than in\r\nthe Faculties of Medicine and of Law, the principal employment of the\r\nprofessors is the awarding of grades.--They likewise confer the titles\r\nof bachelor, licentiate and doctor; but the future bachelor is not\r\nprepared by them; the lycée furnishes him for the examination, fresh\r\nfrom its benches; they have then no audience but future licentiates,\r\nthat is to say a few schoolmasters and a licentiate at long intervals\r\nwho wants to become a doctor in order to mount upward into the\r\nuniversity hierarchy. Besides these, occasional amateurs, nearly all of\r\nripe age, who wish to freshen their classic souvenirs, and idlers who\r\nwant to kill time, fill the lecture-room. To prevent empty benches the\r\nlecture course becomes a conférence d'Athenée, which is pleasant enough\r\nor sufficiently general to interest or, at least, not to repel people\r\nof society.[6231] Two establishments remain for teaching true science to\r\nthe workers who wish to acquire it; who, in the widespread wreck of the\r\nancient régime have alone survived in the Museum of Natural History,\r\nwith its thirteen chairs, and the College of France, with nineteen. But\r\nhere, too, the audience is sparse, mixed, disunited and unsatisfactory;\r\nthe lectures being public and free, everybody enters the room and leaves\r\nas he pleases during the lecture. Many of the attendants are idlers who\r\nseek distraction in the tone and gestures of the professors, or birds\r\nof passage who come there to warm themselves in winter and to sleep in\r\nsummer. Nevertheless, two or three foreigners and half a dozen Frenchmen\r\nthoroughly learn Arabic or zoology from Silvestre de Sacy, Cuvier or\r\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire. That answers the purpose; they are quite enough,\r\nand, elsewhere too in the other branches of knowledge. All that is\r\nrequired is a small élite of special and eminent men--about one hundred\r\nand fifty in France in the various sciences,[6232] and, behind them,\r\nprovisionally, two or three hundred others, their possible successors,\r\ncompetent and designated beforehand by their works and celebrity to fill\r\nthe gaps made by death in the titular staff as these occur. The latter,\r\nrepresentatives of science and of literature, provide the indispensable\r\nadornment of the modern State. But, in addition to this, they are the\r\ndepositaries of a new force, which more and more becomes the principal\r\nguide, the influential regulator and even the innermost motor of human\r\naction. Now, in a centralized State, no important force must be left to\r\nitself; Napoleon is not a man to tolerate the independence of this one,\r\nallowing it to act apart and outside of limitations; he knows how to\r\nutilize it and turn it to his own advantage. He has already grasped\r\nanother force of the same order but more ancient, and, in the same way,\r\nand with equal skill, he also takes hold of the new one.\r\n\r\nIn effect, alongside of religious authority, based on divine revelation\r\nand belonging to the clergy, there is now a lay authority founded on\r\nhuman reason, which is exercised by scientists, erudites, scholars and\r\nphilosophers. They too, in their way, form a clergy, since they\r\nframe creeds and teach a faith; only, their preparatory and dominant\r\ndisposition is not trust and a docile mind, but distrust and the need\r\nof critical examination. With them, nearly every source of belief is\r\nsuspicious. At bottom, among the ways of acquiring knowledge, they\r\naccept but two, the most direct, the simplest, the best tested, and\r\nagain on condition that one proves the other, the type of the first\r\nbeing that process of reasoning by which we show that two and two make\r\nfour, and the second that experience by which we demonstrate that heat\r\nabove a certain degree melts ice, and that cold below a certain degree\r\nfreezes water. This is the sole process that is convincing; all others,\r\nless and less sure in proportion as they diverge from it, possess only\r\na secondary, provisional and contestable value, that which it confers on\r\nthem after verification and check.--Let us accordingly avail ourselves\r\nof this one, and not of another, to express, restrain or suspend\r\nour judgment. So long as the intellect uses it and only it, or its\r\nanalogues, to affirm, set aside or doubt, it is called reason, and the\r\ntruths thus obtained are definitive acquisitions. Acquired one by one,\r\nthe truths thus obtained have for a long time remained scattered, in\r\nthe shape of fragments; only isolated sciences have existed or bits of\r\nscience. About the middle of the eighteenth century these separate parts\r\nbecame united and have formed one body, a coherent system. Out of this,\r\nformerly called philosophy, that is to say a view of nature as a whole,\r\nconsisting of perfect order on lasting foundations, a sort of universal\r\nnetwork which, suddenly enlarged, stretches beyond the physical world\r\nto the moral world, taking in man and men, their faculties and their\r\npassions, their individual and their collective works, various human\r\nsocieties, their history, customs and institutions, their codes and\r\ngovernments, their religions, languages, literatures and fine arts,\r\ntheir agriculture, industries, property, the family and the rest.[6233]\r\nThen also, in each natural whole the simultaneous or successive parts\r\nare connected together; a knowledge of their mutual ties is important,\r\nand, in the spiritual order of things, one accomplishes this, as in\r\nthe material order, through scientific distrust, through critical\r\nexamination, by credible experimentation and process.[6234]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, in 1789, the work in common on this ground had resulted\r\nonly in false conceptions; but this is because instead of credible\r\nprocesses another hasty, plausible, popular, risky and deceptive method\r\nwas applied. People wanted to go fast, conveniently, directly, and, for\r\nguide, accepted unreason under the name of reason. Now, in the light of\r\ndisastrous experience, there was a return to the narrow, stony, long and\r\npainful road which alone leads, both, in speculation, to truth and, in\r\npractice, to salvation.--Besides, this second conclusion, like the first\r\none, was due to recent experience. Henceforth it was evident that, in\r\npolitical and social matters, ideas quickly descend from speculation to\r\npractice. When anybody talks to me about stones, plants, animals and the\r\nstars I must, to listen, be interested in these; if anybody talks to me\r\nabout man and society, it suffices that I am a man and a member of that\r\nsociety; for then it concerns myself, my nearest, daily, most sensitive\r\nand dearest interests; by virtue of being a tax-payer and a subject, a\r\ncitizen and an elector, a property-owner or a proletarian, a consumer or\r\na producer, a free-thinker or a Catholic, a father, son or husband,\r\nthe doctrine is addressed to me; to affect me it has only to be within\r\nreach, through interpreters and others that promulgate it.--This office\r\nappertains to writers great or small, particularly to the educated who\r\npossess wit, imagination or eloquence, a pleasing style, the art of\r\nfinding readers or of making themselves understood. Owing to their\r\ninterposition, a doctrine wrought out by the specialist or thinker\r\nin his study, spreads around through the novel, the theatre and the\r\nlecture-room, by pamphlets, the newspaper, dictionaries, manuals and\r\nconversation, and, finally, by teaching itself. It thus enters all\r\nhouses, knocks at the door of each intellect, and, according as it works\r\nits way more or less forcibly, contributes more or less effectively\r\nto make or unmake the ideas and sentiments that adapt it to the social\r\norder of things in which it is comprised.\r\n\r\nIn this respect it acts like positive religions; in its way and on many\r\naccounts, it is one of them. In the first place, like religion, it is a\r\nliving, principal, inexhaustible fountain-head, a high central reservoir\r\nof active and directing belief. If the public reservoir is not filled\r\nby an intermittent flow, by sudden freshets, by obscure infiltrations\r\nof the mystic faculty, it is regularly and openly fed by the constant\r\ncontributions of the normal faculties. On the other hand, confronting\r\nfaith, by the side of that beneficent divination which, answering the\r\ndemands of conscience and the emotions, fashions the ideal world and\r\nmakes the real world conform to this, it poses the testing process\r\nwhich, analyzing the past and the present, disengages possible laws and\r\nthe probabilities of the future. Doctrine likewise has its dogmas, many\r\ndefinitive and others in the way of becoming so, and hence a full and\r\ncomplete conception of things, vast enough and clear enough, in spite of\r\nwhat it lacks, to take in at once nature and humanity. It, too, gathers\r\nits faithful in a great church, believers and semi believers, who,\r\nconsequently or inconsequently, accept its authority in whole or in\r\npart, listen to its preachers, revere its doctors, and deferentially\r\nawait the decisions of its councils. Wide-spread, still uncertain and\r\nlax under a wavering hierarchy, the new Church, for a hundred years\r\npast, is steadily in the way of consolidation, of progressive ascendancy\r\nand of indefinite extension. Its conquests are constantly increasing;\r\nsooner or later, it will be the first of social powers. Even for the\r\nchief of an army, even for the head of a State, even to Napoleon, it is\r\nwell to become one of its great dignitaries; the second title, in modern\r\nsociety, adds a prestige to the first one: \"Salary of His Majesty the\r\nEmperor and King as member of the Institute, 1500 francs;\" thus begins\r\nhis civil list, in the enumeration of receipts. Already in Egypt,\r\nintentionally and for effect, he heads his proclamations with\r\n\"Bonaparte, commander-in chief, member of the Institute.\" \"I am sure,\"\r\nhe says, \"that the lowest drummer will comprehend it!\"\r\n\r\nSuch a body, enjoying such credit, cannot remain independent. Napoleon\r\nis not content to be one of its members. He wants to hold it in his\r\ngrasp, have it at his own disposition, and use it the same as a member\r\nor, at least, contrive to get effective control of it. He has reserved\r\nto himself an equally powerful one in the old Catholic Church; he has\r\nreserved to himself like equivalents in the young lay Church; and, in\r\nboth cases, he limits them, and subjects them to all the restrictions\r\nwhich a living body can support. In relation to science and religion he\r\nmight repeat word for word his utterances in relation to religion and to\r\nfaith. \"Napoleon has no desire to change the belief of his populations;\r\nhe respects spiritual matters; he wishes simply to dominate them without\r\ntouching them, without meddling with them; all he desires is to make\r\nthem square with his views, with his policy, but through the\r\ninfluence of temporalities.\" To this end, he negotiated with the Pope,\r\nreconstructed, as he wanted it, the Church of France, appointed bishops,\r\nrestrained and directed the canonical authorities. To this end, he\r\nsettles matters with the literary and scientific authorities, gets them\r\ntogether in a large hall, gives them arm-chairs to sit in, gives by-laws\r\nto their groups, a purpose and a rank in the State, in brief, he adopts,\r\nremakes, and completes the \"National Institute\" of France.[6235]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Napoleon's stranglehold on science.\r\n\r\n     Hold of the government on the members of the Institute.--How\r\n     he curbs and keeps them down.--Circle in which lay power may\r\n     act.--Favor and freedom of the mathematical, physical and\r\n     natural sciences.--Disfavor and restrictions on the moral\r\n     sciences.--Suppression of the class of moral and political\r\n     sciences.--They belong to the State, included in the\r\n     imperial domain of the Emperor.--Measures against Ideology,\r\n     philosophic or historic study of Law, Political Economy and\r\n     Statistics.--Monopoly of History.\r\n\r\nThis \"National Institute,\" is the Government's tool and an appendage of\r\nthe State. This is in conformity with the traditions of the old monarchy\r\nand with the plans, sketched out and decreed by the revolutionary\r\nassemblies,[6236] in conformity with the immemorial principle of French\r\nlaw which enlarges the interference of the central power, not only in\r\nrelation to public instruction but to science, literature and the fine\r\narts. It is the State which has produced and shaped it, which has\r\ngiven to it its title, which assigns it its object, its location,\r\nits subdivisions, its dependencies, its correspondences, its mode of\r\nrecruitment, which prescribes its labors, its reports, its quarterly and\r\nannual sessions, which gives it employment and defrays its expenses.\r\nIts members receive a salary, and \"the subjects elected[6237] must be\r\nconfirmed by the First Consul.\" Moreover, Napoleon has only to utter\r\na word to insure votes for the candidate whom he approves of, or to\r\nblackball the candidate whom he dislikes. Even when confirmed by the\r\nhead of the State, an election can be cancelled by his successor; in\r\n1816,[6238] Monge, Carnot, Guyton de Morveau, Grégoire, Garat, David and\r\nothers, sanctioned by long possession and by recognized merit, are to be\r\nstricken off the list. By the same sovereign right, the State admits and\r\nexcludes them, the right of the creator over his creation, and, without\r\npushing his right as far as that, Napoleon uses it.\r\n\r\nHe holds the members of his Institute in check with singular rigidity,\r\neven when, outside of the Institute and as private individuals, they\r\nfail to observe in their writings the proper rules imposed on\r\nevery public body. The rod falls heavily on Jérôme de Lalande, the\r\nmathematician and astronomer who continues the work of Montucla,\r\npublicly and in a humiliating way, the blow being given by his\r\ncolleagues who are thus delegated for the purpose. \"A member of\r\nthe Institute,\" says the imperial note,[6239] \"well known for his\r\nattainments, but now fallen into an infantile state, is not wise enough\r\nto keep his mouth shut, and tries to have himself talked about, at one\r\ntime by advertisements unworthy of his old reputation as well as of the\r\nbody to which he belongs, and again by openly professing atheism, the\r\ngreat enemy of all social organization.\" Consequently, the presidents\r\nand secretaries of the Institute, summoned by the minister, notify the\r\nInstitute \"that it must send to M. de Lalande and enjoin him not to\r\nprint anything, not cast a shadow in his old age over what he has\r\ndone in his vigorous days to obtain the esteem of savants.\" M. de\r\nChateaubriand, in the draft for his admission address, alluding to the\r\nrevolutionary role of his predecessor, Marie Chénier, observed that\r\nhe could eulogize him only as the man of letters,[6240] and, in the\r\nreception committee, six out of twelve academicians had accepted the\r\ndraft. Thereupon, Fontanes, one of the twelve, prudently abstains from\r\ngoing to Saint-Cloud. M. de Ségur, however, president of the committee,\r\nhe goes. In the evening, at the coucher, Napoleon advances to him before\r\nthe whole court and, in that terrifying tone of voice which, even today,\r\nvibrates from the dead lines of the silent page,\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" says he to him, \"do the literary people really desire to set\r\nFrance ablaze?... How dare the Academy speak of regicides?... I ought to\r\nput you and M. de Fontanes, as Councillor of State and Grand-Master, in\r\nVincennes.... You preside over the second division of the Institute.\r\nI order you to inform it that I will not allow politics at its\r\nsessions.... If the class disobeys I will put an end to it as an\r\nobjectionable club!\"\r\n\r\nThus warned, the members of the Institute remain within the circle\r\ntraced out for them and, for many, the circle is sufficiently large. Let\r\nthe first division of the Institute, in the mathematical, physical and\r\nnatural sciences, Lagrange, Laplace, Legendre, Carnot, Biot, Monge,\r\nCassini, Lalande, Burckardt and Arago, Poisson, Berthollet, Gay-Lussac,\r\nGuyton de Morveau, Vauquelin, Thénard and Haüy, Duhamel, Lamarck,\r\nJussieu, Mirbel, Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire and Cuvier, pursue their\r\nresearches; let Delambre and Cuvier, in their quarterly reports, sum up\r\nand announce discoveries; let, in the second division of the Institute,\r\nVolney, Destutt de Tracy, Andrieux, Picard, Lemercier and Chateaubriand,\r\nif the latter desires to take part in its sittings, give dissertations\r\non language, grammar, rhetoric, rules of style and of taste; let, in the\r\nthird division of the Institute, Sylvestre de Sacy publish his Arabic\r\ngrammar; let Langlés continue his Persian, Indian and Tartar studies;\r\nlet Quatremère de Quincy, explaining the structure of the great\r\nchryselephantine statues, reproduce conjecturally the surface of ivory\r\nand the internal framework of the Olympian Jupiter; let D'Ansse de\r\nVilloison discover in Venice the commentary of the Alexandrian critics\r\non Homer; let Larcher, Boissonade, Clavier, alongside of Coraÿ publish\r\ntheir editions of the old Greek authors--all this causes no trouble,\r\nand all is for the honor of the government. Their credit reflects on\r\nthe avowed promoter, the official patron and responsible director of\r\nscience, erudition and talent therefore, in his own interest, he favors\r\nand rewards them. Laurent de Jussieu and Cuvier are titular councillors\r\nof the University, Delambre is its treasurer, and Fontanes its\r\nGrand-Master. Delille, Boissonade and Royer-Collard and Guizot teach in\r\nthe faculty of letters; Biot, Poisson, Gay-Lussac, Haüy, Thénard,\r\nBrongniart, Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire in the faculty of the sciences;\r\nMonge, Berthollet, Fourier, Andrieux in the Ecole Polytechnique; Pinel,\r\nVauquelin, Jussieu, Richerand, Dupuytren in the Ecole de Médecine.\r\nFourcroy is councillor of State, Laplace and Chaptal, after having been\r\nministers, become senators; in 1813, there are twenty-three members of\r\nthe Institute in the Senate; the zoologist Lacépede is grand-chancellor\r\nof the Legion of Honor; while fifty-six members of the Institute,\r\ndecorated with an imperial title, are chevaliers, barons, dukes, and\r\neven princes.[6241]--This is even one more lien, admirably serving to\r\nbind them to the government more firmly and to in-corporate them more\r\nand more in the system. In effect, they now derive their importance\r\nand their living from the system and the government; having become\r\ndignitaries and functionaries they possess a password in this twofold\r\ncapacity; henceforth, they will do well to look upward to the master\r\nbefore expressing a thought and to know how far the password allows them\r\nto think.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, the First Consul's intentions are clear from the\r\nvery first day: In his reconstruction of the Institute[6242] he\r\nhas suppressed \"the division of moral and political sciences,\" and\r\nconsequently the first four sections of this division, \"analysis of\r\nsensations and ideas, moral science, social science and legislation,\r\nand political economy.\" He thus cuts off the main branch with its four\r\ndistinct branches, and what he keeps or tolerates he trims and grafts\r\nor fastens on to another branch of the third class, that of the erudites\r\nand antiquaries. The latter may very well occupy themselves with\r\npolitical and moral sciences but only \"in their relations with history,\"\r\nand especially with ancient history. General conclusions, applicable\r\ntheories, on account of their generality, to late events and to the\r\nactual situation are unnecessary; even as applied to the State in the\r\nabstract, and in the cold forms of speculative discussion, they are\r\nforbidden. The First Consul, on the strength of this, in connection with\r\n\"Dernières vues de politique et de finances, published by Necker, has\r\nset forth his exact rule and his threatening purpose:\r\n\r\n\"Can you imagine,\" says he to Roederer, \"that any man, since I became\r\nhead of the State, could propose three sorts of government for France?\r\nNever shall the daughter of M. Necker come back to Paris!\"\r\n\r\nShe would then get to be a distinct center of political opinion while\r\nonly one is necessary, that of the First Consul in his Council of\r\nState. Again, this council itself is only half competent and at best\r\nconsultative:\r\n\r\n\"You yourselves do not know what government is.[6243] You have no idea\r\nof it. I am the only one, owing to my position, that can know what a\r\ngovernment is.\"\r\n\r\nOn this sphere, and everywhere on its undefined perimeter, afar, as far\r\naway as his piercing eye can penetrate, no independent way of thinking\r\nmust be conceived or, especially, published.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the foremost and guiding science of the analysis of the\r\nhuman understanding, pursued according to the methods and after the\r\nexamples furnished by Locke, Hume, Condillac and Destutt de Tracy,\r\nideology is forbidden.\r\n\r\n\"It is owing to ideology,\" he says,[6244] \"to that metaphysical\r\nobscurity which, employing its subtleties in trying to get at first\r\ncauses, seeks to base the legislation of a people on that foundation,\r\ninstead of appropriating laws to a knowledge of the human heart and the\r\nlessons of history, that all the misfortunes of our beautiful France\r\nmust be attributed.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1806, M. de Tracy, unable to print his \"Commentaire sur l'Esprit\r\ndes Lois\" in France, sends it to the president of the United States,\r\nJefferson, who translates it into English, publishes it anonymously,\r\nand has it taught in his schools.[6245] About the same date, the\r\nrepublication of the \"Traité d'économie-politique\" of J.--B. Say is\r\nprohibited, the first edition of which, published in 1804, was soon\r\nexhausted.[6246] In 1808, all publications of local and general\r\nstatistics, formerly incited and directed by Chaptal, were interrupted\r\nand stopped; Napoleon always demands figures, but he keeps them for\r\nhimself; if divulged they would prove inconvenient, and henceforth\r\nthey become State secrets. The same precautions and the same rigor\r\nare extended to books on law, even technical, and against a \"Précis\r\nhistorique du droit Romain.\" \"This work,\" says the censorship, \"might\r\ngive rise to a comparison between the progress of authority under\r\nAugustus and that going on under the reign of Napoleon, in such a way as\r\nto produce a bad effect on public opinion.\"[6247] In effect, nothing\r\nis more dangerous than history, for it is composed, not of general\r\npropositions that are unintelligible except to the meditative, but of\r\nparticular facts accessible and interesting to the first one that comes\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, not only the science of sensations and of ideas,\r\nphilosophic law and comparative law, politics and moral law, the science\r\nof wealth and statistics, but again, and especially, the history of\r\nFrance, is a State affair, an object of government; for no object\r\naffects the government more nearly; no study contributes so much towards\r\nstrengthening or weakening the ideas and impressions which shape public\r\nopinion for or against him.[6248] It is not sufficient to superintend\r\nthis history, to suppress it if need be, to prevent it from being a poor\r\none; it must again be ordered, inspired and manufactured, that it may be\r\na good one.\r\n\r\n\"There is no work more important.[6249]... I do not count the expense\r\nin this regard. It is even my intention to make the minister ensure that\r\nthis work is under my protection..\"\r\n\r\nAbove all, the attitude of the authors who write should be made sure\r\nof. \"Not only must this work be entrusted to authors of real talent,\r\nbut again to attached men, who will present facts in this true light and\r\nprepare healthy instruction by bringing history down to the year VIII.\"\r\nBut this instruction can be healthy only through a series of preliminary\r\nand convergent judgments, insinuating into all minds the final approval\r\nand well-founded admiration of the existing régime. Accordingly, the\r\nhistorian must feel at each line\" the defects of the ancient régime,\r\n\"the influence of the court of Rome, of confessional tickets, of the\r\nRevocation of the Edict of Nantes, of the ridiculous marriage of Louis\r\nXIV. with Madame de Maintenon, the perpetual disorder in the finances,\r\nthe pretensions of the parliament, the want of rules and leadership in\r\nthe administration,.. in such a way that one breathes on reaching the\r\nepoch when one enjoys the benefits of that which is due to the unity of\r\nthe laws, administration and territory.\" The constant feebleness of\r\nthe government under Louis XIV, even, under Louis XV. and Louis XVI.,\r\n\"should inspire the need of sustaining the newly accomplished work\r\nand its acquired preponderance.\" On the 18th of Brumaire (19-11-1799),\r\nFrance came into port; the Revolution must be spoken of only as a final,\r\nfatal and inevitable tempest.[6250] \"When that work, well done and\r\nwritten in a right direction, appears, nobody will have the will or the\r\npatience to write another, especially when, far from being encouraged by\r\nthe police, one will be discouraged by it.\" In this way, the government\r\nwhich, in relation to the young, has awarded to itself the monopoly\r\nof teaching, awards to itself in relation to adults, the monopoly of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. On Censorship under Napoleon.\r\n\r\n     Measures against writers so called and popularizers.\r\n     --Censorship, control of theaters, publications and printing.\r\n     --Extent and minuteness of the repression.--Persistency in\r\n     direction and impulsion.--The logical completeness and\r\n     beauty of the whole system his final object.--How he\r\n     accomplishes his own destruction.\r\n\r\nIf Napoleon in this manner takes precautions against those who think, it\r\nis only because their thoughts, should they be written down, might reach\r\nthe public,[6251] and only the sovereign alone has the right to talk in\r\npublic. Between writer and readers, every communication is intercepted\r\nbeforehand by a triple and quadruple line of defenses through which\r\na long, tortuous and narrow wicket is the only passage, and where\r\nthe manuscript, like a bundle of suspicious goods, is overhauled and\r\nrepeatedly verified after having obtained its free certificate and its\r\npermit of circulation. Napoleon declares \"the printing-office[6252] to\r\nbe an arsenal which must not be within the reach of everybody... It is\r\nvery important for me that only those be allowed to print who have the\r\nconfidence of the government. A man who addresses the public in print is\r\nlike the man who speaks in public in an assembly, and certainly no\r\none can dispute the sovereign's right to prevent the first comer from\r\nharanguing the public.\"--On the strength of this, he makes publishing\r\na privileged, authorized and regulated office of the State. The writer,\r\nconsequently, before reaching the public, must previously undergo the\r\nscrutiny of the printer and bookseller, who, both responsible, sworn\r\nand patented, will take good care not to risk their patent, the loss of\r\ntheir daily bread, ruin, and, besides this, a fine and imprisonment.--In\r\nthe second place, the printer, the bookseller and the author are obliged\r\nto place the manuscript or, by way of toleration, the work as it goes\r\nthrough the press, in the hands of the official censors;[6253] the\r\nlatter read it and make their weekly report to the general director\r\nof publications; they indicate the good or bad spirit of the work,\r\nthe \"unsuitable or forbidden passages according to circumstances,\"\r\nthe intended, involuntary or merely possible allusions; they exact the\r\nnecessary suppressions, rectifications and additions. The publisher\r\nobeys, the printers furnish proofs, and the author has submitted; his\r\nproceedings and attendance in the bureaux are at end. He thinks himself\r\nsafe in port, but he is not.\r\n\r\nThrough an express reservation, the director-general always has the\r\nright to suppress works, \"even after they have been examined, printed\r\nand authorized to appear.\" In addition to this, the minister of\r\nthe police,[6254] who, above the director-general, likewise has his\r\ncensorship bureau, may, in his own right, place seals on the sheets\r\nalready printed, destroy the plates and forms in the printing-office,\r\nsend a thousand copies of the \"Germany\" by Madame de Staël to the\r\npaper-mill, \"take measures to see that not a sheet remains,\" demand of\r\nthe author his manuscript, recover from the author's friends the two\r\ncopies he has lent to them, and take back from the director-general\r\nhimself the two copies for his service locked up in a drawer in\r\nhis cabinet.--Two years before this, Napoleon said to Auguste de\r\nStaël,[6255]\r\n\r\n\"Your mother is not bad. She has intelligence, a good deal of\r\nintelligence. But she is unaccustomed to any kind of discipline. She\r\nwould not be six months in Paris before I should be obliged to put her\r\nin the Temple or at Bicêtre. I should be sorry to do this, because it\r\nwould make a noise and that would injure me in public Opinion.\"\r\n\r\nIt makes but little difference whether she abstains from talking\r\npolitics: \"people talk politics in talking about literature, the fine\r\narts and morality, about everything in the world; women should busy\r\nthemselves with their knitting,\" and men keep silent or, if they do\r\ntalk, let it be on a given subject and in the sense prescribed.\r\n\r\nOf course, the inspection of publications is still more rigorous and\r\nmore repressive, more exacting and more persistent.--At the theatre,\r\nwhere the assembled spectators become enthusiastic through the quick\r\ncontagion of their sensibilities, the police cut out of the \"Heraclius\"\r\nof Corneille and the \"Athalie\" of Racine[6256] from twelve to\r\ntwenty-five consecutive lines and patch up the broken passages as\r\ncarefully as possible with lines or parts of lines of their own.--On the\r\nperiodical press, on the newspaper which has acquired a body of readers\r\nand which exercises an influence and groups its subscribers according to\r\nan opinion, if not political, at least philosophic and literary,\r\nthere is a compression which goes even as far as utter ruin. From the\r\nbeginning of the Consulate,[6257] sixty out of seventy-three political\r\njournals are suppressed; in 1811, the thirteen that still existed are\r\nreduced to four and the editors-in-chief are appointed by the minister\r\nof police. The property of these journals, on the other hand, is\r\nconfiscated, while the Emperor, who had taken it, concedes it, one\r\nthird to his police and the other two thirds to people of the court\r\nor littérateurs who are his functionaries or his creatures. Under this\r\nalways aggravated system the newspapers, from year to year, become so\r\nbarren that the police, to interest and amuse the public, contrive a pen\r\nwarfare in their columns between one amateur of French music and one of\r\nItalian music.\r\n\r\nBooks, almost as rigorously kept within bounds, are mutilated or\r\nprevented from appearing.[6258] Chateaubriand is forbidden to reprint\r\nhis \"Essay on Revolutions,\" published in London under the Directory. In\r\n\"L'Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem\" he is compelled to cut out \"a good\r\ndeal of declamation on courts, courtiers and certain features calculated\r\nto excite misplaced allusions.\" The censorship interdicts the \"Dernier\r\ndes Abencerrages,\" where\" it finds too warm an interest in the Spanish\r\ncause.\" One must read the entire register to see it at work and in\r\ndetail, to feel the sinister and grotesque minutia with which it pursues\r\nand destroys, not alone among great or petty writers but, again,\r\namong compilers and insignificant abbreviators, in a translation, in a\r\ndictionary, in a manual, in an almanac, not only ideas but suggestions,\r\nechoes, semblances and oversights in thinking, the possibilities of\r\nawakening reflection and comparison:\r\n\r\n* every souvenir of the ancient régime, this or that mention of Kléber\r\nor Moreau, or a particular conversation of Sully and Henry IV.;\r\n\r\n* \"a game of loto,[6259] which familiarizes youth with the history\r\nof their country,\" but which says too much about \"the family of the\r\ngrand-dauphin of Louis XVI. and his aunts\";\r\n\r\n* the general work of the reveries of Cagliostro and of M. Henri de\r\nSaint-Mesmin, very laudatory of the Emperor, excellent \"for filling\r\nthe soul of Frenchmen with his presence, but which must leave out three\r\nawkward comparisons that might be detected by the malevolent or the\r\nfoolish;\"\r\n\r\n* the \"translation into French verse of several of David's psalms,\"\r\nwhich are not dangerous in Latin but which, in French, have the defect\r\nof a possible application, through coincidence and prophecy, to the\r\nChurch as suffering, and to religion as persecuted;\r\n\r\nand quantities of other literary insects hatched in the depths of\r\npublication, nearly all ephemeral, crawling and imperceptible, but which\r\nthe censor, through zeal and his trade, considers as fearsome dragons\r\nwhose heads must be smashed or their teeth extracted.\r\n\r\nAfter the next brood they prove inoffensive, and, better still, are\r\nuseful, especially the almanacs,[6260] \"in rectifying on various points\r\nthe people's attitudes. It will probably be possible after 1812 to\r\ncontrol their composition, and they are filled with anecdotes, songs and\r\nstories adapted to the maintenance of patriotism and of devotion to the\r\nsacred person of His Majesty and to the Napoleonic dynasty.\"--To this\r\nend, the police likewise improves, orders and pays for dramatic or lyric\r\nproductions of all kinds, cantatas, ballets, impromptus, vaudevilles,\r\ncomedies, grand-operas, comic operas, a hundred and seventy-six works\r\nin one day, composed for the birth of the King of Rome and paid for in\r\nrewards to the sum of 88,400 francs. Let the administration look to\r\nthis beforehand so as to raise up talent and have it bear good fruit.\r\n\"Complaints are made because we have no literature;[6261] it is the\r\nfault of the minister of the interior. Napoleon personally and in the\r\nheight of a campaign interposes in theatrical matters. Whether far away\r\nin Prussia or at home in France, he leads tragic authors by the hand,\r\nRaynouard, Legouvé, Luce de Lancival; he listens to the first reading of\r\nthe \"Mort d'Henri IV.\" and the \"États de Blois.\" He gives to Gardel, a\r\nballet-composer, \"a fine theme in the Return of Ulysses.\" He explains to\r\nauthors how dramatic effect should, in their hands, become a political\r\nlesson; for lack of anything better, and waiting for these to comprehend\r\nit, he uses the theatre the same as a tribune for the reading to the\r\nspectators of his bulletins of the grand army.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the daily newspapers, he is his own advocate, the\r\nmost vehement, the haughtiest, the most powerful of polemics. For a long\r\ntime, in the \"Moniteur,\" he himself dictates articles which are known by\r\nhis style. After Austerlitz, he has no time to do this, but he inspires\r\nthem all and they are prepared under his orders. In the \"Moniteur\" and\r\nother gazettes, it is his voice which, directly or by his spokesmen,\r\nreaches the public; it alone prevails and one may divine what it utters!\r\nThe official acclaim of every group or authority in the State again\r\nswell the one great, constant, triumphant adulatory hymn which, with\r\nits insistence, unanimity and violent sonorities, tends to bewilder all\r\nminds, deaden consciences and pervert the judgment.\r\n\r\n\"Were it open to doubt,\" says a member of the tribunate,[6262] \"whether\r\nheaven or chance gives sovereigns on earth, would it not be evident for\r\nus that we owe our Emperor to some divinity?\"\r\n\r\nAnother of the choir then takes up the theme in a minor key and thus\r\nsings the victory of Austerlitz:\r\n\r\n\"Europe, threatened by a new invasion of the barbarians, owes its safety\r\nto the genius of another Charles Martel.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar cantatas follow, intoned in the senate and lower house by\r\nLacépède, Pérignon and Garat, and then, in each diocese, by the bishops,\r\nsome of whom, in their pastoral letters, raise themselves up to the\r\ntechnical considerations of military art, and, the better to praise the\r\nEmperor, explain to their parishioners the admirable combinations of his\r\nstrategic genius.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, his strategy is admirable, lately against Catholic ideas and\r\nnow against the secular mind. First of all, he has extended, selected\r\nand defined his field of operations, and here is his objective point,\r\nfixed by himself:\r\n\r\n\"On public affairs, which are my affairs in political, social and\r\nmoral matters, on history, and especially on actual history, recent\r\nand modern, nobody of the present generation is to give any thought\r\nbut myself and, in the next generation, everybody will follow my\r\nexample.\"[6263]\r\n\r\nThe monopoly of education therefore belongs to him. He has introduced\r\nmilitary uniforms, discipline and spirit into all the public and private\r\nsecondary educational establishments. He has reduced and subjected the\r\necclesiastical superintendence of primary education to the minimum. He\r\nhas removed the last vestige of regional, encyclopedic and autonomous\r\nuniversities and substituted for these special and professional schools,\r\nHe has rendered veritable superior instruction abortive and stifled all\r\nspontaneous and disinterested curiosity in youth.--Meanwhile ascending\r\nto the source of secular knowledge, he has brought the Institute under\r\nhis influence. On this government tool he has effected the necessary\r\ncuts, appropriated the credit to himself and imposed his favor or\r\ndisfavor on the masters of science and literature. Then, descending\r\nfrom the source to the canals, constructing dams, arranging channels,\r\napplying his constraints and impulsions, he has subjected science\r\nand literature to his police, to his censorship and to his control\r\nof publishing and printing. He has taken possession of all the\r\nmedia--theatres, newspapers, books, pulpits and tribunes. He has\r\norganized all these into one vast industry which he watches over and\r\ndirects, a factory of public attitudes which works unceasingly and in\r\nhis hands to the glorification of his system, reign and person.[6264]\r\nAgain here, he is found equal and similar to himself, a stern conqueror\r\nmaking the most of his conquest to the last extreme, a shrewd operator\r\nas meticulous as he is shrewd, as resourceful as he is consequent,\r\nincomparable in adapting means to ends, unscrupulous in carrying them\r\nout,[6265] fully satisfied that, through the constant physical pressure\r\nof universal and crushing dread, all resistance would be overcome. He\r\nis maintaining and prolonging the struggle with colossal forces, but\r\nagainst a historic and natural force lying beyond his grasp, lately\r\nagainst belief founded on religious instinct and on tradition, and\r\nnow against evidence engendered by realities and by the agency of the\r\ntesting process. Consequently, obliged to forbid the testing process, to\r\nfalsify things, to disfigure the reality, to deny the evidence, to lie\r\ndaily and each day more outrageously,[6266] to accumulate glaring\r\nacts so as to impose silence, to arouse by this silence and by these\r\nlies[6267] the attention and perspicacity of the public, to transform\r\nalmost mute whispers into sounding words and insufficient eulogies into\r\nopen protestations. In short, weakened by his own success and condemned\r\nbeforehand to succumb under his victories, to disappear after a short\r\ntriumph, Napoleon will leave intact and erect the indestructible rival\r\n(science and knowledge) whom he would like to crush as an adversary but\r\nturn to account as an instrument.[6268]\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6201: Lamennais, \"Du Progrès de la Révolution,\" p.163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6202: Any socialist or social-nationalist leader would\r\nundoubtedly have been impressed by Napoleon's ability to control and\r\ndominate his admiring people and do their best to copy his methods.\r\n(SR.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6203: \"The Modern Régime,\" I., 247.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6204: Pelet de la Lozère, p. 159.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6205: Maggiolo, \"Les Écoles en Lorraine avant et aprés 1789,\"\r\n3rd part, p.22 and following pages.

But, as the small schools satisfy a felt want, they increase.\r\nIn 1815, there are more than 22,000, about as many as in 1789; in the\r\nfour departments examined by M.

Evolution of the Napoleonic machine.\r\n\r\n     History of the Napoleonic machine.--The first of its two\r\n     arms, operating on adults, is dislocated and breaks.--The\r\n     second, which operates on youth, works intact until 1850.\r\n     --Why it remains intact.--Motives of governors.--Motives of\r\n     the governed.\r\n\r\nAfter him, the springs of his machine relax; and so do, naturally, the\r\ntwo groups controlled by the machine. The first, that of adult men,\r\nfrees itself the most and the soonest: during the following half\r\ncentury, we see the preventive or repressive censorship of books,\r\njournals and theatres, every special instrument that gags free speech,\r\nrelaxing its hold, breaking down bit by bit and at last tumbling to the\r\nground. Even when again set up and persistently and brutally applied,\r\nold legal muzzles are never to become as serviceable as before. No\r\ngovernment will undertake, like that of Napoleon, to stop at once all\r\noutlets of written thought; some will always remain more or less open.\r\nEven during the rigorous years of the Restoration and of the second\r\nEmpire the stifling process is to diminish; mouths open and there is\r\nsome way of public expression, at least in books and likewise through\r\nthe press, provided one speaks discreetly and moderately in cool and\r\ngeneral terms and in a low, even tone of voice. Here, the imperial\r\nmachine, too aggressive, soon broke down; immediately, the iron arm by\r\nwhich it held adults seemed insupportable to them and they were able\r\nmore and more to bend, push it away or break it. Today, in 1890, nothing\r\nremains of it but its fragments; for twenty years it has ceased to work\r\nand its parts, even, are utterly useless.\r\n\r\nBut, to the contrary, in the other direction, in the second group, on\r\nchildren, on boys, on young men, the second arm, intact down to 1850,\r\nthen shortened but soon strengthened, more energetic and more effective\r\nthan ever, maintained its hold almost entirely.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, after 1814, its mechanism is less rigid, its application\r\nless strict, its employment less universal, its operation less severe;\r\nit gives less offence and does not hurt as much. For example, after\r\nthe first Restoration,[6301] the decree of 1811 against the smaller\r\nseminaries is repealed. They are handed back to the bishops, resume\r\ntheir ecclesiastical character and return to the special and normal\r\nroad out of which Napoleon forced them to march. The drum, the drill and\r\nother exercises too evidently Napoleonic disappear almost immediately in\r\nthe private and public establishments devoted to common instruction. The\r\nschool system ceases to be a military apprenticeship and the college is\r\nno longer a preparatory annex for the barracks. Soon and for many years,\r\nGuizot, Cousin, and Villemain brilliantly hold the chairs at Sorbonne\r\nuniversity and teach the highest subjects of philosophy, literature and\r\nhistory admired by attentive and sympathetic audiences. Later, under the\r\nmonarchy of July, the Institute, mutilated by the First Consul, restores\r\nand completes itself. It becomes once more united with the suspect\r\ndivision of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, which after\r\nthe Consulate, had been missing. In 1833, a minister, Guizot, provides,\r\nthrough a law which has become an institution, for the regular\r\nmaintenance, the obligatory appropriation, the certain recruitment, and\r\nfor the quality and universality of primary instruction. At the same\r\ntime, during eighteen years, the university administration, moderating\r\nits pressure or smoothing its sharp points, operates at the three\r\nstages of instruction in tolerant or liberal hands, with all the caution\r\ncompatible with its organization. It does so in such a way as to do a\r\ngreat deal of good without much harm, by half-satisfying the majority\r\nwhich, in its entirety, is semi-believer, semi-freethinker, by not\r\nseriously offending anybody except the Catholic clergy and that\r\nunyielding minority which, through doctrinal principle or through\r\nreligious zeal, assigns to education as a directing end and supreme\r\nobject, the definitive cultivation, rooting and flowering of faith. But,\r\nin law as well as in fact, the University of 1808 still subsists; it has\r\nkept its rights, it levies its taxes, it exercises its jurisdiction and\r\nenjoys its monopoly.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Restoration, in 1814, the government maintained\r\nit only provisionally. It promised everything, radical reform and\r\nfull liberty. It announced that, through its efforts, \"the forms\r\nand direction of the education of children should be restored to the\r\nauthority of fathers and mothers, tutors and families.\"[6302] Simply\r\na prospectus and an advertisement by the new pedagogue who installs\r\nhimself and thus, by soothing words, tries to conciliate parents. After\r\na partial sketch and an ordinance quickly repealed,[6303] the rulers\r\ndiscover that the University of Napoleon is a very good reigning tool,\r\nmuch better than that of which they had the management previous to 1789,\r\nmuch easier handled and more serviceable. It is the same with all social\r\ntools sketched out and half-fashioned by the Revolution and completed\r\nand set a-going by the Consulate and the Empire; each is constructed\r\n\"by reason,\" \"according to principles,\" and therefore its mechanism is\r\nsimple; its pieces all fit into each other with precision; they transmit\r\nthroughout exactly the impulsion received and thus operate at one\r\nstroke, with uniformity, instantaneously, with certitude, oil all parts\r\nof the territory; the lever which starts the machine is central and,\r\nthroughout its various services, the new rulers hold this lever in hand.\r\nApropos of local administration, the Duc d'Angoulême said in 1815,[6304]\r\n\"We prefer the departments to the provinces.\" In like manner, the\r\ngovernment of the restored monarchy prefers the imperial University,\r\nsole, unique, coherent, disciplined and centralized, to the old\r\nprovincial universities, the old scattered, scholastic institution,\r\ndiverse, superintended rather than governed, to every school\r\nestablishment more or less independent and spontaneous.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it gains thereby a vast staff of salaried\r\ndependents, the entire teaching staff,[6305] on which it has a hold\r\nthrough its favors or the reverse through ambition and the desire for\r\npromotion, through fear of dismissal and concern for daily bread. At\r\nfirst, 22,000 primary teachers, thousands of professors, directors,\r\ncensors, principals, regents and subordinates in the 36 lycées, 368\r\ncolleges and 1255 institutions and boarding-schools. After this, many\r\nhundreds of notable individuals, all the leading personages of each\r\nuniversity circumscription, the administrators of 28 academies, the\r\nprofessors of the 23 literary faculties, of the 10 faculties of the\r\nsciences, of the 9 faculties of law, and of the 3 faculties of\r\nmedicine. Add to these, the savants of the Collège de France and École\r\nPolytechnique, every establishment devoted to high, speculative\r\nor practical instruction: these are highest in repute and the most\r\ninfluential; here the heads of science and of literature are found.\r\nThrough them and their seconds or followers of every degree, in the\r\nfaculties, lycées, colleges, minor seminaries, institutions, boarding\r\nschools, and small schools, beliefs or opinions can be imposed on, or\r\nsuggested to, 2000 law students, 4000 medical students, 81,000 thousand\r\npupils in secondary education and 700,000 scholars in the primary\r\ndepartment. Let us retain and make use of this admirable tool, but let\r\nus apply it to our own purposes and utilize it for our service.[6306]\r\nThus far, under the Republic and the Empire, its designers, more or less\r\nJacobin, have moved it as they thought best, and therefore moved it to\r\nthe \"left\". Let us now move, as it suits us, to the \"right.\"[6307]\r\nAll that is necessary is to turn it in another direction and for good;\r\nhenceforth,\" the basis of education[6308] shall be religion, monarchy,\r\nlegitimacy and the charter.\"\r\n\r\nTo this end, we, the dominant party, use our legal rights. In the place\r\nof bad wheels we put good ones. We purify our staff. We do not appoint\r\nor leave in place any but safe men. At the end of six years, nearly\r\nall the rectors, proviseurs and professors of philosophy, many other\r\nprofessors and a number of the censors,[6309] are all priests. At the\r\nSorbonne, M. Cousin has been silenced and M. Guizot replaced by M.\r\nDurosoir. At the Collège de France we have dismissed Tissot and we do\r\nnot accept M. Magendie. We \"suppress\" in block the Faculty of Medicine\r\nin order that, on reorganizing it, our hands may be free and eleven\r\nprofessors with bad notes be got rid of, among others Pinel, Dubois, de\r\nJussieu, Desgenettes, Pelletan and Vauquelin. We suppress another center\r\nof insalubrities, the upper École Normale, and, for the recruitment of\r\nour educational body, we institute[6310] at the principal seat of each\r\nacademy a sort of university novitiate where the pupils, few in number,\r\nexpressly selected, prepared from their infancy, will imbibe deeper\r\nand more firmly retain the sound doctrines suitable to their future\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nWe let the small seminaries multiply and fill up until they comprise\r\n50,000 pupils. It is the bishop who founds them; no educator or\r\ninspector of education is so worthy of confidence. Therefore, we confer\r\nupon him \"in all that concerns religion,\"[6311] the duty \"of visiting\r\nthem himself, or delegating his vicars-general to visit them,\" the\r\nfaculty \"of suggesting to the royal council of public instruction the\r\nmeasures which he deems necessary.\" At the top of the hierarchy sits\r\na Grand-Master with the powers and title of M. de Fontanes and with\r\nan additional title, member of the cabinet and minister of public\r\ninstruction, M. de Freyssinous, bishop of Hermopolis,[6312] and, in\r\ndifficult cases, this bishop, placed between his Catholic conscience and\r\nthe positive articles of the legal statute, \"sacrifices the law\" to his\r\nconscience.[6313]--This is the advantage which can be taken from the\r\ntool of public education. After 1850, it is to be used in the same way\r\nand in the same sense; after 1796, and later after 1875, it was made to\r\nwork as vigorously in the opposite direction. Whatever the rulers may\r\nbe, whether monarchists, imperialists or republicans, they are the\r\nmasters who use it for their own advantage; for this reason, even when\r\nresolved not to abuse the instrument, they keep it intact; they reserve\r\nthe use of it for themselves,[6314] and pretty hard blows are necessary\r\nto sever or relax the firm hold which they have on the central lever.\r\n\r\nExcept for these excesses and especially after they finish, when the\r\ngovernment, from 1828 to 1848, ceases to be sectarian, and the\r\nnormal play of the institution is no longer corrupted by political\r\ninterference, the governed accept the University in block, just as their\r\nrulers maintain it: they also have motives of their own, the same as for\r\nsubmitting to other tools of Napoleonic centralization.--And first\r\nof all, as a departmental and communal institution, the university\r\ninstitution operates wholly alone; it exacts little or no collaboration\r\non the part of those interested; it relieves them of any effort, dispute\r\nor care, which is pleasant. Like the local administration, which,\r\nwithout their help or with scarcely any, provides them with bridges,\r\nroads, canals, cleanliness, salubrity and precautions against contagious\r\ndiseases, the scholastic administration, without making any demand on\r\ntheir indolence, puts its full service, the local and central apparatus\r\nof primary, secondary, superior and special instruction, its staff and\r\nmaterial, furniture and buildings, masters and schedules, examinations\r\nand grades, rules and discipline, expenditure and receipts, all at its\r\ndisposition. As at the door of a table d'hôte, they are told,\r\n\r\n\"Come in and take a seat. We offer you the dishes you like best and in\r\nthe most convenient order. Don't trouble yourself about the waiters\r\nor the kitchen; a grand central society, an intelligent and beneficent\r\nagency, presiding at Paris takes charge of this and relieves you of it.\r\nPass your plate, and eat; that is all you need care about. Besides, the\r\ncharge is very small.\"[6315]\r\n\r\nIn effect, here as elsewhere, Napoleon has introduced his rigid\r\neconomical habits, exact accounts and timely or disguised\r\ntax-levies.[6316] A few additional centimes among a good many others\r\ninserted by his own order in the local budget, a few imperceptible\r\nmillions among several hundreds of other millions in the enormous sum of\r\nthe central budget, constitute the resources which defray the expenses\r\nof public education. Not only does the quota of each taxpayer for this\r\npurpose remain insignificant, but it disappears in the sum total of\r\nwhich it is only an item that he does not notice.--The parents, for the\r\ninstruction of a child, do not pay out of their pockets directly, with\r\nthe consciousness of a distinct service rendered them and which they\r\nindemnify,[6317] but 12, 10, 3, or even 2 francs a year; again,\r\nthrough the increasing extension of gratis instruction, a fifth, then a\r\nthird,[6318] and later one half of them are exempt from this charge.\r\n\r\nFor secondary instruction, at the college or the lycée, they take out\r\nof their purses annually only 40 or 50 francs; and, if their son is a\r\nboarder, these few francs mingle in with others forming the total sum\r\npaid for him during the year, about 700 francs,[6319] which is a small\r\nsum for defraying the expenses, not only of instruction, but, again, for\r\nthe support of the lad in lodging, food, washing, light, fire and the\r\nrest. The parents, at this rate, feel that they are not making a bad\r\nbargain; they are not undergoing extortion, the State not acting like a\r\nrapacious contractor. And better yet, it is often a paternal creditor,\r\ndistributing, as it does, three or four thousand scholarships. If their\r\nson obtains one of these, their annual debt is remitted to them and the\r\nentire university provision of instruction and support is given to\r\nthem gratis. In the Faculties, the payment of fees for entrance,\r\nexaminations, grades and diplomas is not surprising, for the\r\ncertificates or parchments they receive in exchange for their money are,\r\nfor the young man, so many positive acquisitions which smooth the way to\r\na career and serve as valuable stock which confers upon him social rank.\r\nBesides, the entrance to these Faculties is free and gratuitous, as well\r\nas in all other establishments for superior instruction. Whoever chooses\r\nand when he chooses may attend without paying a cent.\r\n\r\nThus constituted, the University seems to the public as a liberal,\r\ndemocratic, humanitarian institution and yet economical, expending\r\nvery little. Its administrators and professors, even the best of them,\r\nreceive only a small salary--6000 francs at the Muséum and the Collége\r\nde France,[6320] 7500 at the Sorbonne, 5000 in the provincial Faculties,\r\n4000 or 3000 in the lycées, 2000, 1500 and 1200 in the communal\r\ncolleges--just enough to live on. The highest functionaries live in a\r\nvery modest way; each keeps body and soul together on a small salary\r\nwhich he earns by moderate work, without notable increase or decrease,\r\nin the expectation of gradual promotion or of a sure pension at the end.\r\nThere is no waste, the accounts being well kept; there are no sinecures,\r\neven in the libraries; no unfair treatment or notorious scandals. Envy,\r\nnotions of equality scarcely exist; there are enough situations for\r\npetty ambitions and average merit, while there is scarcely any place\r\nfor great ambitions or great merit. Eminent men serve the State and\r\nthe public cheaply for a living salary, a higher rank in the Legion of\r\nHonor, sometimes for a seat in the Institute, or for European fame\r\nin connection with a university, with no other recompense than the\r\nsatisfaction of working according to conscience[6321] and of winning the\r\nesteem of twenty or thirty competent judges who, in France or abroad,\r\nare capable of appreciating their labor at its just value.[6322]\r\n\r\nThe last reason for accepting or tolerating the University; its work\r\nat home, or in its surroundings, develops gradually and more or less\r\nbroadly according to necessities.--In 1815, there were 22,000 primary\r\nschools of every kind; in 1829,[6323] 30,000; and in 1850, 63,000. In\r\n1815, 737,000 children were taught in them; in 1829, 1,357,000; and\r\nin 1850, 3,787,000. In 1815, there was only one normal school for the\r\neducation of primary teachers; in 1850, there are 78. Consequently,\r\nwhilst in 1827, 42 out of 100 conscripts could read, there were in 1877,\r\n85; whilst in 1820, 34 out of 100 women could write their names on the\r\nmarriage contract, in 1879 there are 70.--Similarly, in the lycées and\r\ncolleges, the University which, in 1815, turned out 37,000 youths, turns\r\nout 54,000 in 1848, and 64,000 in 1865;[6324] many branches of study,\r\nespecially history,[6325] are introduced into secondary instruction\r\nand bear good fruit.--Even in superior instruction which, through\r\norganization, remains languid, for parade, or in a rut, there are\r\nameliorations; the State adds chairs to its Paris establishments and\r\nfounds new Faculties in the provinces. In sum, an inquisitive mind\r\ncapable of self-direction can, at least in Paris, acquire full\r\ninformation and obtain a comprehensive education on all subjects by\r\nturning the diverse university institutions to account.--If there\r\nare very serious objections to the system, for example, regarding the\r\nboarding part of it (internat), the fathers who had been subject to it\r\naccept it for their sons. If there were very great defects in it, for\r\nexample, the lack of veritable universities, the public which had not\r\nbeen abroad and ignores history did not perceive them. In vain does M.\r\nCousin, in relation to public instruction in Germany, in his eloquent\r\nreport of 1834, as formerly Cuvier in his discreet report of 1811, point\r\nout this defect; in vain does M. Guizot, the minister, propose to remove\r\nit:\r\n\r\n\"I did not find,\" says he,[6326] \"any strong public opinion which\r\ninduced me to carry out any general and urgent measure in higher\r\ninstruction. In the matter of superior instruction the public, at\r\nthis time,... was not interested in any great idea, or prompted by\r\nany impatient want.... Higher education as it was organized and given,\r\nsufficed for the practical needs of society, which regarded it with a\r\nmixture of satisfaction and indifference.\"\r\n\r\nIn the matter of education, not only at this third stage but again for\r\nthe first two stages, public opinion so far as aims, results, methods\r\nand limitations is concerned, was apathetic. That wonderful science\r\nwhich, in the eighteenth century, with Jean-Jacques, Condillac,\r\nValentin, Hally, Abbé de l'Epée and so many others, sent forth such\r\npowerful and fruitful jets, had dried up and died out; transplanted to\r\nSwitzerland and Germany, pedagogy yet lives but it is dead on its native\r\nsoil.[6327] There is no longer in France any persistent research nor are\r\nthere any fecund theories on the aims, means, methods, degrees and forms\r\nof mental and moral culture, no doctrine in process of formation and\r\napplication, no controversies, no dictionaries and special manuals, not\r\none well-informed and important Review, and no public lectures. Now\r\nan experimental science is simply the summing-up of many diverse\r\nexperiences, freely attempted, freely discussed and verified. Through\r\nthe forced results of the university monopoly there are no actual\r\nuniversities: among other results of the Napoleonic institution, one\r\ncould after 1808 note, the decadence of pedagogy and foresee its early\r\ndemise. Neither parents, nor masters nor the young cared anything about\r\nit; outside of the system in which they live they imagine nothing; they\r\nare accustomed to it the same as to the house in which they dwell. They\r\nmay grumble sometimes at the arrangement of the rooms, the low stories\r\nand narrow staircases, against bad lighting, ventilation and want of\r\ncleanliness, against the exactions of the proprietor and concierge; but,\r\nas for transforming the building, arranging it otherwise, reconstructing\r\nit in whole or in part, they never think of it. For, in the first place,\r\nthey have no plan; and next, the house is too large and its parts too\r\nwell united; through its mass and size it maintains itself and would\r\nstill remain indefinitely if, all at once, in 1848, an unforeseen\r\nearthquake had not made breaches in its walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Educational monopoly of Church and State.\r\n\r\n     Law of 1850 and freedom of instruction.--Its apparent object\r\n     and real effects.--Alliance of Church and State.--The real\r\n     monopoly.--Ecclesiastical control of the University until\r\n     1859.--Gradual rupture of the Alliance.--The University\r\n     again becomes secular.--Lay and clerical interests.\r\n     --Separation and satisfaction of both interests down to 1876.\r\n     --Peculiarity of this system.--State motives for taking the\r\n     upper hand.--Parents, in fact, have no choice between two\r\n     monopolies.--Original and forced decline of private\r\n     institutions.--Their ruin complete after 1850 owing to the\r\n     too-powerful and double competition of Church and State.\r\n     --The Church and the State sole surviving educators.\r\n     --Interested and doctrinal direction of the two educational\r\n     systems.--Increasing divergence in both directions.--Their\r\n     effect on youth.\r\n\r\nThe day after the 24th of February 1848,[6328] M. Cousin, meeting M.\r\nde Remusat on the quay Voltaire, raised his arms towards heaven and\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Let us hurry and fall on our knees in front of the bishops--they alone\r\ncan save us now!\"\r\n\r\nWhile M. Thiers, with equal vivacity, in the parliamentary committee\r\nexclaimed: \"Cousin, Cousin, do you comprehend the lesson we have\r\nreceived? Abbé Dupanloup is right.\"[6329] Hence the new law.[6330] M.\r\nBeugnot, who presented it, clearly explains its aims and object: the\r\nGovernment \"must assemble the moral forces of the country and unite\r\nthem with each other to combat with and overthrow the common enemy,\" the\r\nanti-social party, \"which, victorious, would have no mercy on anybody,\"\r\nneither on the University nor on the Church. Consequently, the\r\nUniversity abandons its monopoly: the State is no longer the sole\r\npurveyor of public instruction; private schools and associations may\r\nteach as they please. The government will no longer inspect their\r\n\"education,\" but only \"morality, hygiene, and salubrity;\"[6331]--they\r\nare out of its jurisdiction and exempt from its taxes. Therefore, the\r\ngovernment establishments and free establishments will no longer be\r\ndangerous adversaries, but \"useful co-operators;\" they will owe and give\r\nto each other \"good advice and good examples;\" it will maintain for\r\nboth \"an equal interest;\" henceforth, its University \"will be merely an\r\ninstitution supported by it to quicken competition and make this bear\r\ngood fruit,\" and, to this end, it comes to an understanding with its\r\nprincipal competitor, the Church.\r\n\r\nBut in this coalition of the two powers it is the Church which has the\r\nbest of it, takes the upper hand and points out the way. For, not only\r\ndoes she profit by the liberty decreed, and profit by it almost alone,\r\nfounding in twenty years afterwards nearly one hundred ecclesiastical\r\ncolleges and putting the Ignorantin brethren everywhere in the primary\r\nschools; but, again, by virtue of the law,[6332] she places four bishops\r\nor archbishops in the superior council of the University; by virtue of\r\nthe law, she puts into each departmental academic council the bishop of\r\nthe diocese and a priest selected by him; moreover, through her credit\r\nwith the central government she enjoys all the administrative favors.\r\nIn short, from above and close at hand, she leads, keeps in check,\r\nand governs the lay University and, from 1849 to 1859, the priestly\r\ndomination and interference, the bickering, the repressions, the\r\ndismissals,[6333] the cases of disgrace, are a revival of the system\r\nwhich, from 1821 to 1828, had already been severe. As under the\r\nRestoration, the Church had joined hands with the State to administrate\r\nthe school-machine in concert with it; but, under the Restoration, she\r\nreserves to herself the upper hand, and it is she who works the machine\r\nrather than the State. In sum, under the name, the show, and the\r\ntheoretical proclamation of liberty for all, the University monopoly\r\nis reorganized, if not by law, at least in fact, and in favor of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nTowards 1859, and after the war in Italy, regarding the Pope and\r\nthe temporal power, the hands which were joined now let go and then\r\nseparate; there is a dissolution of partnership; their interests cease\r\nto agree. Two words are coined, both predestined to great fortune, on\r\nthe one side the \"secular\" interest and on the other side the \"clerical\"\r\ninterest; henceforth, the government no longer subordinates the former\r\nto the latter and, under the ministry of M. Duruy, the direction of the\r\nUniversity becomes frankly secular. Consequently, the entire educational\r\nsystem, in gross and in its principal features, is to resemble, until\r\n1876, that of the of July.[6334] For sixteen years, the two great\r\nteaching powers, the spiritual and the temporal, unable to do better,\r\nare to support each other but act apart, each on its own ground and each\r\nin its own way; only the Church no longer acts through the toleration\r\nand gracious permission of the University, but through the legal\r\nabolition of the monopoly and by virtue of a written law. The whole\r\ncomposes a passable régime, less oppressive than those that preceded it;\r\nin any event, the two millions of devout Catholics who consider unbelief\r\nas a terrible evil, the fathers and mothers who subordinate instruction\r\nto education,[6335] and desire above all things to preserve the faith\r\nof their children up to adult age, now find in the ecclesiastical\r\nestablishments well-run hothouses and protected against draughts of\r\nmodernity. One urgent need of the first order,[6336] legitimate, deeply\r\nfelt by many men and especially by women, has received satisfaction;\r\nparents who do not experience this want, place their children in the\r\nlycées; in 1865, in the smaller seminaries and other ecclesiastical\r\nschools there are 54,000 pupils and in the State colleges and lycées\r\n64,000,[6337] which two bodies balance each other.\r\n\r\nBut even that is a danger. For, naturally, the teaching State finds with\r\nregret that its clients diminish; it does not view the rival favorably\r\nwhich takes away so many of its pupils. Naturally also, in case of an\r\nelectoral struggle, the Church favors the party which favors it, the\r\neffect of which is to expose it to ill-will and, in case of political\r\ndefeat, to hostilities. Now, the chances are, that, should hostile\r\nrulers, in this case, attempt to strike it in its most vulnerable point,\r\nthat of teaching, they might set aside liberty, and even toleration, and\r\nadopt the school machine of Napoleon in order to restore it as best they\r\ncould, enlarge it, derive from it for their own profit and against the\r\nChurch, whatever could be got out of it, to use with all their power\r\naccording to the principles and intentions of the Convention and the\r\nDirectory. Thus, the compromise accepted by Church and State is simply\r\na provisional truce; to-morrow, this truce will be broken; the fatal\r\nFrench prejudice which erects the State into a national educator is ever\r\npresent; after a partial and brief slackening of its energy, it will try\r\nto recover its ascendancy and recommence its ravages.--And, on the other\r\nhand, even under this régime, more liberal than its predecessor, real\r\nliberty is much restricted; instead of one monopoly, there are two.\r\nBetween two kinds of establishments, one secular, resembling a barracks,\r\nand the other ecclesiastical, resembling a seminary or convent, parents\r\nmay choose and that is all. Ordinarily, if they prefer one, it is not\r\nbecause they consider it good, but because, in their opinion, the other\r\nis worse, while there is no third one at hand, built after a different\r\ntype, with its own independent and special character, adapting itself to\r\ntheir tastes and accommodating itself to their necessities.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the century there were thousands of secondary\r\nschools of every kind and degree, everywhere born or reborn,\r\nspontaneous, local, raised up through the mutual understanding of\r\nparents and masters, and, consequently, subject to this understanding,\r\ndiverse, flexible, dependent on the law of supply and demand,\r\ncompetitive, each careful to keep its own patrons, each compelled, like\r\nevery other private enterprise, to adjust its working to the views and\r\nfaculties of its clients. It is very probable that, if these had been\r\nallowed to exist, if the new legislator had not been radically hostile\r\nto permanent corporations, endowments, and mortmain titles; if, through\r\nthe jealous intervention of his Council of State and the enormous\r\nlevies of his fiscal system, the government had not discouraged free\r\nassociations and the free donations to which they might have been\r\nentitled, the best of these secondary schools would have survived: those\r\nwhich might have been able to adapt themselves to their surroundings\r\nwould have had the most vitality; according to a well-known law, they\r\nwould have prospered in branching off, each in its own sense and in its\r\nown way.--Now, at this date, after the demolitions of the Revolution,\r\nall pedagogic roads were open and, at each of their starting-points,\r\nthe runners were ready, not merely the secular but, again, independent\r\necclesiastics, liberal Gallicans, surviving Jansenists, constitutional\r\npriests, enlightened monks, some of them philosophers and half-secular\r\nin mind or even at heart, using Port-Royal manuals, Rollin's \"Traité des\r\nÉtudes\" and Condillac's \"Cours d'Etudes,\" the best-tried and most fecund\r\nmethods of instruction, all the traditions of the seventeenth century\r\nfrom Arnauld to Lancelot and all the novelties of the eighteenth century\r\nfrom Locke to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, all wide-awake or aroused by the\r\ndemands of the public and by this unique opportunity and eager to do\r\nand to do well. In the provinces[6338] as at Paris, people were seeking,\r\ntrying and groping. There was room and encouragement for original,\r\nsporadic and multiple invention, for schools proportionate with and\r\nsuited to various and changing necessities, Latin, mathematical or\r\nmixed schools, some for theoretical science and others for practical\r\napprenticeship, these commercial and those industrial, from the lowest\r\nstandpoint of technical and rapid preparation up to the loftiest summits\r\nof speculative and prolonged study.\r\n\r\nOn this school world in the way of formation, Napoleon has riveted his\r\nuniformity, the rigorous apparatus of his university, his unique\r\nsystem, narrow, inflexible, applied from above. We have seen with what\r\nrestrictions, with what insistence, with what convergence of means, what\r\nprohibitions, what taxes, what application of the university monopoly,\r\nand with what systematic hostility to private establishments!--In the\r\ntowns, and by force, they become branches of the lycée and imitate its\r\nclasses; in this way Sainte-Barbe is allowed to subsist at Paris and,\r\nuntil the abolition of the monopoly, the principal establishments of\r\nParis, Massin, Jauffrey, Bellaguet, existed only on this condition,\r\nthat of becoming auxiliaries, subordinates and innkeepers for lycée\r\nday-scholars; such is still the case to-day for the lycées Bossuet\r\nand Gerson. In the way of education and instruction the little that an\r\ninstitution thus reduced can preserve of originality and of pedagogic\r\nvirtue is of no account.--In the country, the Oratoriens who have\r\nrepurchased Juilly are obliged,[6339] in order to establish a free and\r\ndurable school of \"Christian and national education,\" to turn aside\r\nthe civil law which interdicts trusts and organize themselves into a\r\n\"Tontine Society\" and thus present their disinterested enterprise in the\r\nlight of an industrial and commercial speculation, that of a lucrative\r\nand well-attended boarding school. Still at the present day similar\r\nfictions have to be resorted to for the establishment and duration of\r\nlike enterprises.[6340]\r\n\r\nNaturally, under this prohibitive régime, private establishments are\r\nborn with difficulty; and afterwards, absorbed, mutilated and strangled,\r\nthey find no less difficulty in keeping alive and thus degenerate,\r\ndecline and succumb one by one. And yet, in 1815, not counting the 41\r\nsmall seminaries with their 5000 scholars, there still remained 1,225\r\nprivate schools, with 39,000 scholars, confronting the 36 lycées and 368\r\ncommunal colleges which, together, had only 37,000 scholars. Of these\r\n1,255 private schools there are only 825 in 1854, 622 in 1865, 494 in\r\n1876, and, finally, in 1887, 302 with 20,174 scholars; on the other\r\nhand, the State establishments have 89,000 schools, and those of the\r\nChurch amount to 73,000. It is only after 1850 that the decadence of\r\nsecular and private institutions is precipitated; in effect, instead\r\nof one competitor, they have two, the second as formidable as the first\r\none, both enjoying unlimited credit, possessors of immense capital and\r\ndetermined to spend money without calculation, the State, on one side\r\nabstracting millions from the pockets of the taxpayers and, on the other\r\nside, the Church deriving its millions from the purses of the faithful:\r\nthe struggle between isolated individuals and these two great\r\norganized powers who give instruction at a discount or gratis is too\r\nunequal.[6341]\r\n\r\nSuch is the actual and final effect of the first Napoleonic monopoly:\r\nthe enterprise of the State has, by a counter-stroke, incited the\r\nenterprise of the clergy; both now complete the ruin of the others,\r\nprivate, different in kind and independent, which, supported wholly by\r\nfamily approbation, have no other object in view than to render families\r\ncontent. On the contrary, along with this purpose, the two survivors\r\nhave another object, each its own, a superior and doctrinal object, due\r\nto its own particular interest and antagonism to the opposite interest;\r\nit is in view of this object, in view of a political or religious\r\npurpose, that each in its own domicile directs education and instruction\r\nlike Napoleon, each inculcates on, or insinuates into, young minds its\r\nsocial and moral opinions which are clear-cut and become cutting. Now,\r\nthe majority of parents, who prefer peace to war, desire that their\r\nchildren should entertain moderate and not bellicose opinions. They\r\nwould like to see them respectful and intelligent, and nothing more.\r\nBut neither of the two rival institutions thus limits itself; each works\r\nbeyond and aside,[6342] and when the father, at the end of July,[6343]\r\ngoes for his son at the ecclesiastical college or secular institution,\r\nhe risks finding in the young man of seventeen the militant prejudices,\r\nthe hasty and violent conclusions and the uncompromising rigidity of\r\neither a \"laïcisant\" or a \"clérical.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Internal Vices\r\n\r\n     The internal vices of the system.--Barrack or convent\r\n     discipline of the boarding-school.--Number and proportions\r\n     of scholars in State and Church establishments.--Starting\r\n     point of the French boarding-school.--The school community\r\n     viewed not as a distinct organ of the State but as a\r\n     mechanism wielded by the State.--Effects of these two\r\n     conceptions.--Why the boarding-school entered into and\r\n     strengthened ecclesiastical establishments.--Effects of the\r\n     boarding-school on the young man.--Gaps in his experience,\r\n     errors of judgment, no education of his will.--The evil\r\n     aggravated by the French system of special and higher\r\n     schools.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the innate vices of the primitive system have lasted and,\r\nand, among others, the worst of all, the internat[6344] under the\r\ndiscipline of barracks or convent, while the university, through\r\nits priority and supremacy, in contact with or contiguously, has\r\ncommunicated this discipline at first to its subordinates, and afterward\r\nto its rivals.--In 1887,[6345] in the State lycées and colleges,\r\nthere are more than 39,000 boarding-schools (internes) while, in the\r\necclesiastic establishments, it is worse: out of 50,000 pupils there,\r\nover 27,000 are internes, to which must be added the 23,000 pupils of\r\nthe small seminaries, properly so called, nearly all of them boarders;\r\nin a total of 163,000 pupils we find 89,000 internes.[6346] Thus, to\r\nsecure secondary instruction, more than one-half of the youth of France\r\nundergo the internat, ecclesiastic or secular. This is peculiar to\r\nFrance, and is due to the way in which Napoleon, in 1806, seized on and\r\nperverted all school enterprises.[6347]\r\n\r\nBefore 1789, in France, this enterprise, although largely trammeled and\r\nimpeded by the State and the Church, was not violated in principle nor\r\nperverted in essence; still at the present day, in Germany, in England,\r\nin the United States, it exists and is developed in accordance with its\r\nnature. It is admitted to be a private enterprise,[6348] the collective\r\nand spontaneous work of several associates voluntarily bound together,\r\nold founders, actual and future benefactors, masters and parents and\r\neven scholars,[6349] each in his place and function, under a statute\r\nand according to tradition, in such a way as to continue functioning\r\nindefinitely, in order to provide, like a gas company on its own\r\nresponsibility, at its own risk and expense, a provider of services for\r\nthose who want it; in other terms, the school enterprise must, like any\r\nother undertaking, render acceptable what it offers thereby satisfying\r\nthe needs of its clients.--Naturally, it adapts itself to these needs;\r\nits directors and those concerned do what is necessary. With hands free,\r\nand grouped around an important interest evidently for a common purpose,\r\nmutually bound and veritable associates not only legally but in feeling,\r\ndevoted to a local enterprise and local residents for many years, often\r\neven for life, they strive not to offend the profound repugnance of the\r\nyoung and of families. They therefore make the necessary arrangements\r\ninternally and with the parents.[6350]\r\n\r\nThat is why, outside of France, the French internat, so artificial,\r\nso forced, so exaggerated, is almost unknown. In Germany, out of one\r\nhundred pupils in the gymnases, which correspond to our lycées, there\r\nare scarcely ten boarders lodged and fed in the gymnase; the rest, even\r\nwhen their parents do not live near by, remain day-scholars, private\r\nguests in the families that harbor them, often at a very low price and\r\nwhich take the place of the absent family. No boarders are found in\r\nthem except in a few gymnases like Pforta and by virtue of an ancient\r\nendowment. The number, however, by virtue of the same endowment, is\r\nlimited; they dine, in groups of eight or ten,[6351] at the same table\r\nwith the professors lodged like themselves in the establishment,\r\nwhile they enjoy for a playground a vast domain of woods, fields and\r\nmeadow.--The same in England, at Harrow, Eton and Rugby. Each professor,\r\nhere, is keeper of a boarding-house; he has ten, twenty and thirty boys\r\nunder his roof, eating at his table or at a table the head of which is\r\nsome lady of the house. Thus, the youth goes from the family into the\r\nschool, without painful or sudden contrast, and remains under a\r\nsystem of things which suits his age and which is a continuation, only\r\nenlarged, of domestic life.[6352]\r\n\r\nThe French college or lycée is quite the opposite. It operates against\r\nthe true spirit of the school, and has done so for eighty years being an\r\nenterprise of the State, a local extension of a central enterprise, one\r\nof the hundred branches of the great State university trunk, possessing\r\nno roots of its own and with a directing or teaching staff composed\r\nof functionaries similar to others, that is to say transferable,[6353]\r\nrestless and preoccupied with promotion, their principal motive for\r\ndoing well being the hope of a higher rank and of getting a better\r\nsituation. This almost separate them in advance from the establishment\r\nin which they labor and,[6354] besides that, they are led, pushed on,\r\nand restrained from above, each in his own particular sphere and in\r\nhis limited duty. The principal (proviseur) is confined to his\r\nadministrative position and the professor to his class, expressly\r\nforbidden to leave it. No professor is \"under any pretext to receive in\r\nhis house as boarders or day-scholars more than ten pupils.\"[6355]\r\nNo woman is allowed to lodge inside the lycée or college walls,\r\nall,--proviseur, censor, cashier, chaplain, head-masters and assistants,\r\nfitted by art or force to each other like cog-wheels, with no deep\r\nsympathy, with no moral tie, without collective interests, a cleverly\r\ndesigned machine which, in general, works accurately and smoothly, but\r\nwith no soul because, to have a soul, it is of prime necessity to have\r\na living body. As a machine constructed at Paris according to a unique\r\npattern and superposed on people and things from Perpignan to Douai and\r\nfrom Rochelle to Besançon, it does not adapt itself to the requirements\r\nof the public; it subjects its public to the exigencies, rigidity and\r\nuniformity of its play and structure. Now, as it acts mechanically only,\r\nthrough outward pressure, the human material on which it operates must\r\nbe passive, composed, not of diverse persons, but of units all alike;\r\nits pupils must be for it merely numbers and names.--Owing to this our\r\ninternats, those huge stone boxes set up and isolated in each large\r\ntown, those lycées parceled out to hold three hundred, four hundred,\r\neven eight hundred boarders, with immense dormitories, refectories and\r\nplaygrounds, recitation-rooms full to overflowing, and, for eight or ten\r\nyears, for one half of our children and youths, an anti-social unnatural\r\nsystem apart, strict confinement, no going out except to march in\r\ncouples under the eyes of a sub-teacher who maintains order in the\r\nranks, promiscuity and life in common, exact and minute regularity under\r\nequal discipline and constant constraint in order to eat, sleep, study,\r\nplay, promenade and the rest,--in short, COMMUNISM.\r\n\r\nFrom the University this system is propagated among its rivals. In\r\nconferring grades and passing examinations, it arranges and overburdens\r\nthe school program of study; hence, it incites in others what it\r\npractices at home, the over-training of youth, and a factitious,\r\nhot-house education. On the other hand, the internat is, for those who\r\ndecide on that, less troublesome than the day-school;[6356] also,\r\nthe more numerous the boarders in any one establishment, the less\r\nthe expense; thus, in order to exist in the face of the university\r\nestablishments, there must be internats and internats that are full.\r\nEcclesiastical establishments willingly resign themselves to all this;\r\nthey are even inclined that way; the Jesuits were the first ones, under\r\nthe old monarchy, who introduced cloistered and crowded boarding-houses.\r\nIn its essence, the Catholic church, like the French State, is a Roman\r\ninstitution, still more exclusive and more governmental, resolved to\r\nseize, hold on to, direct and control man entirely, and, first of all,\r\nthe child, head and heart, opinions and impressions, in order to stamp\r\nin him and lastingly the definitive and salutary forms which are for him\r\nthe first condition of salvation. Consequently, the ecclesiastical cage\r\nis more strict in its confinement than the secular cage; if the bars are\r\nnot so strong and not so rough, the grating, finer and more yielding, is\r\nmore secure, closer and better maintained; they do not allow any holes\r\nor relaxation of the meshes; the precautions against worldly and family\r\ninterference, against the mistakes and caprices of individual effort,\r\nare innumerable, and form a double or even triple network. For, to\r\nschool discipline is added religious discipline, no less compulsory,\r\njust as rigid and more constant--daily pious exercises, ordinary\r\ndevotions and extraordinary ceremonies, spiritual guidance, influence of\r\nthe confessional and the example and behavior of a staff kept together\r\naround the same work by the same faith. The closer the atmosphere, the\r\nmore powerful the action; the chances are that the latter will prove\r\ndecisive on the child sequestered, sheltered and brought up in a retort,\r\nand that its intellect, faith and ideas, carefully cultivated, pruned\r\nand always under direction, will exactly reproduce the model aimed\r\nat.--For this reason, in 1876, 33,000 out of 46,000 pupils belonging\r\nto the 309 ecclesiastical establishments of secondary instruction, are\r\ninternes,[6357] and the Catholic authorities admit that, in the 86 small\r\nseminaries, no day-scholars, no future lay persons, are necessary.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is perhaps reasonable in relation to the 23,000\r\npupils of the small seminaries, and for the 10,000 pupils in the great\r\nseminaries; it is perhaps reasonable also for the future military\r\nofficers formed by the State at La Flèche, Saint-Cyr, Saumur, and on the\r\nBorda.[6358] Whether future soldiers or future priests, their education\r\nfits them for the life they are to lead; what they are to become as\r\nadults, they already are as youths and children; the internat, under a\r\nconvent discipline or that of the barracks, qualifies them beforehand\r\nfor their profession. Since they must possess the spirit of it they must\r\ncontract its habits. Having accepted the form of their pursuit they more\r\neasily accept its constraints and all the more that the constraints\r\nof the regiment will be less for the young officer who recently was at\r\nSaint-Cyr, and for the young ministrant in the rural parish who recently\r\nwas in the great seminary.--It is quite the reverse for the 75,000 other\r\ninternes of public or private establishments, ecclesiastic or secular,\r\nfor the future engineers, doctors, architects, notaries, attorneys,\r\nadvocates and other men of the law, functionaries, land-owners, chiefs\r\nand assistants in industry, agriculture and commerce. For them the\r\ninternat affords precisely the opposite education required for a\r\nsecular and civil career. These carry away from the prolonged internat\r\na sufficient supply of Latin or of mathematics; but they are lacking\r\nin two acquisitions of capital import: they have been deprived of two\r\nindispensable experiences. On entering society the young man is ignorant\r\nof its two principal personages, man and woman, as they are and as he is\r\nabout to meet them in society. He has no idea of them, or rather he has\r\nonly a preconceived, arbitrary and false conception of them.--He has\r\nnot dined, commonly, with a lady, head of the house, along with her\r\ndaughters and often with other ladies; their tone of voice, their\r\ndeportment at table, their toilette, their greater reserve, the\r\nattentions they receive, the air of politeness all around, have not\r\nimpressed on his imagination the faintest lines of an exact notion;\r\nhence, there is something wanting in him in relation to how he\r\nshould demean himself; he does not know how to address them, feels\r\nuncomfortable in their presence; they are strange beings to him, new,\r\nof an unknown species.--In a like situation, at table in the evening,\r\nhe has never heard men conversing together: he has not gathered in the\r\nthousand bits of information which a young growing mind derives from\r\ngeneral conversation:\r\n\r\n* about careers in life, competition, business, money, the domestic\r\nfireside and expenses;\r\n\r\n* about the cost of living which should always depend on income;\r\n\r\n* about the gain which nearly always indicates the current rates of\r\nlabor and of the social subjection one undergoes;\r\n\r\n* about the pressing, powerful, personal interests which are soon to\r\nseize him by the collar and perhaps by the throat;\r\n\r\n* about the constant effort required the incessant calculation, the\r\ndaily struggle which, in modern society, makes up the life of an\r\nordinary man.\r\n\r\nAll means of obtaining knowledge have been denied him, the contact with\r\nliving and diverse men, the images which the sensations of his eyes and\r\nears might have stamped on his brain. These images constitute the sole\r\nmaterials of a correct, healthy conception; through them, spontaneously\r\nand gradually, without too many deceptions or shocks, he might\r\nhave figured social life to himself, such as it is, its conditions,\r\ndifficulties, and its opportunities: he has neither the sentiment of it\r\nnor even a premonition. In all matters, that which we call common sense\r\nis never but an involuntary latent summary, the lasting, substantial\r\nand salutary depot left in our minds after many direct impressions.\r\nWith reference to social life, he has been deprived of all these direct\r\nimpressions and the precious depot has never been formed in him.--e He\r\nhas scarcely ever conversed with his professors; their talk with him has\r\nbeen about impersonal and abstract matters, languages, literature and\r\nmathematics. He has spoken but little with his teachers, except\r\nto contest an injunction or grumble aloud against reproof. Of real\r\nconversation, the acquisition and exchange of ideas, he has enjoyed\r\nnone, except with his comrades: if, like him, all are internes, they\r\ncan communicate to each other only their ignorance. If day-scholars are\r\nadmitted, they are active smugglers or willing agents who bring into the\r\nhouse and circulate forbidden books and obscene journals, along with\r\nthe filthy provocative and foul atmosphere of the streets.--Now, with\r\nexcitement of this kind or in this manner, the brains of these captives,\r\nas puberty comes on and deliverance draws near, work actively and we\r\nknow in what sense[6359] and in what counter-sense, how remote from\r\nobservable and positive truth, how their imagination pictures society,\r\nman and woman, under what simple and coarse appearances, with what\r\ninadequacy and presumption, what appetites of liberated serfs and\r\njuvenile barbarians, how, as concerns women, their precocious and turbid\r\ndreams first become brutal and cynical,[6360] how, as concerns men,\r\ntheir unballasted and precipitous thought easily becomes chimerical\r\nand revolutionary.[6361] The downhill road is steep on the bad side, so\r\nthat, to put on the brake and stop, then to remount the hill, the young\r\nman who takes the management of his life into his own hands, must know\r\nhow to use his own will and persevere to the end.\r\n\r\nBut a faculty is developed only by exercise, and the French internat\r\nis the engine the most effective for hindering the exercise of this\r\none.--The youth, from the first to the last day of his internat, has\r\nnever been able to deliberate on, choose and decide what he should do\r\nat any one hour of his schooldays; except to idle away time in\r\nstudy-hours, and pay no attention at recitations, he could not exercise\r\nhis will. Nearly every act, especially his outward attitudes, postures,\r\nimmobility, silence, drill and promenades in rank, is only obedience to\r\norders. He has lived like a horse in harness, between the shafts of his\r\ncart; this cart itself, kept straight by its two wheels, must not leave\r\nthe rectilinear ruts hollowed out and traced for it along the road; it\r\nis impossible for the horse to turn aside. Besides, every morning he is\r\nharnessed at the same hour, and every evening he is unharnessed at the\r\nsame hour; every day, at other hours, he has to rest and take his ration\r\nof hay and oats. He has never been under the necessity of thinking about\r\nall this, nor of looking ahead or on either side; from one end of the\r\nyear to the other, he has simply had to pull along guided by the bridle\r\nor urged by the whip, his principal motives being only of two kinds: on\r\nthe one hand more or less hard guidance and urgings, and on the other\r\nhand his recalcitrance, laziness and fatigue; he has been obliged to\r\nchoose between the two. For eight or ten years, his initiative is\r\nreduced to that--no other employment of his free will. The education of\r\nhis free will is thus rudimentary or nonexistent.\r\n\r\nOn the strength of this our (French) system supposes that it is complete\r\nand perfect. We cast the bridle on the young man's neck and hand him\r\nover to his own government. We admit that, by extraordinary grace, the\r\nscholar has suddenly become a man; that he is capable of prescribing and\r\nfollowing his own orders; that he has accustomed himself to weighing the\r\nnear and remote consequences of his acts, of imputing them to himself,\r\nof believing himself responsible for them; that his conscience, suddenly\r\nemancipated, and his reason, suddenly adult, will march straight on\r\nathwart temptations and immediately recover from slips. Consequently, he\r\nis set free with an allowance in some great city; he registers himself\r\nunder some Faculty and becomes one among ten thousand other students on\r\nthe sidewalks of Paris.--Now, in France, there is no university police\r\nforce to step in, as at Bonn or Göttingen, at Oxford or Cambridge, to\r\nwatch his conduct and punish him in the domicile and in public places.\r\nAt the schools of medicine, Law, Pharmacy, Fine-Arts, Charters, and\r\nOriental Languages, at the Sorbonne and at the École Centrale, his\r\nemancipation is sudden and complete. When he goes from secondary\r\neducation to superior education he does not, as in England and in\r\nGermany, pass from restricted liberty to one less restricted, but from a\r\nmonastic discipline to compete independence. In a furnished room, in the\r\npromiscuity and incognito of a common hotel, scarcely out of college,\r\nthe novice of twenty years finds at hand the innumerable temptations of\r\nthe streets, the taverns, the bars, public balls, obscene publications,\r\nchance acquaintances, and the liaisons of the gutter. Against all this\r\nhis previous education has disarmed him. Instead of creating a moral\r\nforce within him, the long and strict internat has maintained moral\r\ndebility. He yields to opportunity, to example; he goes with the\r\ncurrent, he floats without a rudder, he lets himself drift. As far as\r\nhygiene, or money, or sex, is concerned, his mistakes and his follies,\r\ngreat or small, are almost inevitable, while it is an average chance if,\r\nduring his three, four or five years of full license, he does not become\r\nentirely corrupt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Cramming and Exams Compared to Apprenticeship\r\n\r\n     Another vice of the system.--Starting-point of superior\r\n     instruction in France.--Substitution of special State\r\n     schools for free encyclopedic universities.--Effect of this\r\n     substitution.--Examinations and competitions.--Intense,\r\n     forced and artificial culture.--How it reaches an extreme.\r\n     --Excess and prolongation of theoretical studies.\r\n     --Insufficiency and tardiness of practical apprenticeship.\r\n     --Comparison of this system with others, between France before\r\n     1789 and England and the United States.--Lost forces.\r\n     --Mistaken use and excessive expenditure of mental energy.--\r\n     --The entire body of youth condemned to it after 1889.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider another effect of the primitive institution, not\r\nless pernicious. On leaving the lycée after the philosophy class, the\r\nsystem supposes that a general education is fully obtained; there is not\r\nquestion of a second one, ulterior and superior, that of universities.\r\nIn place of these encyclopedic universities, of which the object is\r\nfree teaching and the free progress of knowledge, it establishes special\r\nState schools, separate from each other, each confined to a distinct\r\nbranch, each with a view to create, verify and proclaim a useful\r\ncapacity, each devoted to leading a young man along, step by step,\r\nthrough a series of studies and tests up to the title or final diploma\r\nwhich qualifies him for his profession, a diploma that is indispensable\r\nor, at least, very useful since, without it, in many cases, one has no\r\nright to practice his profession and which, thanks to it, in all cases,\r\nenables one to enter on a career with favor and credit, in fair rank,\r\nand considerably promoted.--On entering most careers called liberal,\r\na first diploma is exacted, that of bachelor of arts, or bachelor of\r\nsciences, sometimes both, the acquisition of which is now a serious\r\nmatter for all French youth, a daily and painful preoccupation. To this\r\nend, when about sixteen, the young man works, or, rather, is worked\r\nupon. For one or two years, he submits to a forced culture, not in\r\nview of learning and of knowing, but to answer questions well at an\r\nexamination, or tolerably well, and to obtain a certificate, on proof\r\nor on semblance of proof, that he has received a complete classical\r\neducation.--Next after this, at the medical or law school, during the\r\nfour prescribed years, sixteen graduated inscriptions, four or five\r\nsuperposed examinations, two or three terminal verifications, oblige\r\nhim to furnish the same proof, or semblance of proof, to verify, as each\r\nyear comes round, his assimilation of the lessons of the year, and thus\r\nattest that, at the end of his studies, he possesses about the entire\r\nscope and diversity of knowledge to which he is restricted.\r\n\r\nIn the schools where the number of pupils is limited, this culture,\r\ncarried still farther, becomes intense and constant. In the\r\nÉcole Centrale and in the commercial or agronomic schools, in the\r\nPolytechnique or Normale, he is there all day and all night,--he is\r\nhoused in a barracks.--And the pressure on him is twofold--the pressure\r\nof examinations and that of competition. On entering, on leaving, and\r\nduring his stay there, not only at the end of each year but every six\r\nor three months, often every six weeks, and even every fortnight, he\r\nis rated according to his compositions, exercises and interrogatories,\r\ngetting so many marks for his partial value, so many for his total value\r\nand according to these figures, classed at a certain rank among\r\nhis comrades who are his rivals. To descend on the scale would be\r\ndisadvantageous and humiliating; to ascend on the scale is advantageous\r\nand glorious. Driven by this motive, so strong in France, his principal\r\naim is to go up or, at least, not to go down; he devotes all his energy\r\nto this; he expends none of it on either side or beyond; he allows\r\nhimself no diversion, he abstains from taking any initiative; his\r\nrestrained curiosity never ventures outside of the circle traced for\r\nhim; he absorbs only what he is taught and in the order in which it\r\nis taught; he fills himself to the brim, but only to disgorge at the\r\nexamination and not to retain and hold on to; he runs the risk of\r\nchoking and when relieved, of remaining empty. Such is the régime of our\r\nGrande Ecoles. They are systematic, energetic and prolonged system of\r\ngardening; the State, the gardener-in-chief, receiving or selecting\r\nplants which it undertakes to turn out profitably, each of its kind. To\r\nthis end, it separates the species, and ranges each apart on a bed of\r\nearth; and here, all day long, it digs, weeds, rakes, waters, adds\r\none manure after another, applies its powerful heating apparatus and\r\naccelerates the growth and ripening of the fruit. On certain beds\r\nit plants are kept under glass throughout the year; in this way it\r\nmaintains them in a steady, artificial atmosphere, forcing them to more\r\nlargely imbibe the nutritive liquids with which it floods the ground,\r\nthus causing them to swell and become hypertrophied, so as to produce\r\nfruits or vegetables for show, and which it exposes and which bring it\r\ncredit; for all these productions look well, many of them superb,\r\nwhile their size seems to attest their excellence; they are weighted\r\nbeforehand and the official labels with which they are decorated\r\nannounce the authentic weight.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter, and even the first half, of the (19th)\r\ncentury, the system remained almost unobjectionable; it had not yet\r\npushed things to excess. Down to 1850 and later, all that was demanded\r\nof the young, in their examinations and competitions, was much less\r\nthe extent and minutia of knowledge than proofs of intelligence and the\r\npromise of capacity: in a literary direction, the main object was to\r\nverify whether the candidate, familiar with the classics, could write\r\nLatin correctly and French tolerably well; in the sciences, if he\r\ncould, without help, accurately and promptly solve a problem; if, again\r\nunaided, he could readily and accurately to the end, state a long series\r\nof theorems and equations without divergence or faltering; in sum, the\r\nobject of the test was to verify in him the presence and degree of\r\nthe mathematical or literary faculty.--But, since the beginning of the\r\ncentury, the old subdivided sciences and the new consolidated sciences\r\nhave multiplied their discoveries and, necessarily, all discoveries end\r\nin finding their way into public instruction. In Germany, for them to\r\nbecome installed and obtain chairs, encyclopedic universities are found,\r\nin which free teaching, pliant and many-sided, rises of itself to the\r\nlevel of knowledge.[6362] With us, for lack of universities, they have\r\nhad only special schools[6363]; here only could a place be found for\r\nthem and professors obtained. Henceforth, the peculiar character of\r\nthese schools has changed: they have ceased to be strictly special\r\nand veritably professional.--Each school, being an individuality, has\r\ndeveloped apart and on its own account; its aim has been to install and\r\nfurnish under its own roof all the general, collateral, accessory and\r\nornamental studies which, far or near, could be of service to its own\r\npupils. No longer content with turning out competent and practical\r\nmen, it has conceived a superior type, the ideal model of the engineer,\r\nphysician, jurist, professor or architect. To produce this extraordinary\r\nand desirable professional, it has designed some excessively difficult\r\nimpressive lectures.[6364] To be able to make use of these, it has given\r\nthe young man the opportunity not only to acquire abstract, multiple,\r\ntechnical knowledge, and information, but also the complementary culture\r\nand lofty general ideas, which render the specialist a true savant and a\r\nman of a very broad mind.\r\n\r\nTo this end, it has appealed to the State. The State, the contractor\r\nfor public instruction, the founder of every new professional chair,\r\nappoints the occupant, pays the salary and, when in funds, is not\r\nill-disposed, for it thus gains a good reputation, an increase of\r\ngranting power and a new functionary. Such is the why and wherefore, in\r\neach school, of the multiplication of professorships: schools of law, of\r\nmedicine, of pharmacy, of charters, of fine arts, polytechnic, normal,\r\ncentral, agronomic and commercial schools, each becoming, or tending to\r\nbecome, a sort of university on a small scale, bringing together within\r\nits walls the totality of teachings which, if the student profits by\r\nthem, renders him in his profession an accomplished personage.\r\nNaturally, to secure attendance at these lectures, the school, in\r\nconcert with the State, adds to the exigencies of its examinations, and\r\nsoon, for the average of intellects and for health, the burden imposed\r\nby it becomes too heavy. Particularly, in the schools to which admission\r\nis gained only through competitions the extra load is still more\r\nburdensome, owing to the greater crowd striving to pass; there are now\r\nfive, seven and even eleven candidates for one place.[6365] With this\r\ncrowd, it has been found necessary to raise and multiply the barriers,\r\nurge the competitors to jump over them, and to open the door only to\r\nthose who jump the highest and in the greatest number. There is no other\r\nway to make a selection among them without incurring the charge of\r\ndespotism and nepotism. It is their business to have sturdy legs and\r\nmake the best of them, then to submit to methodical training, to\r\npractice and train all year and for several years in succession, in\r\norder to pass the final test, without thinking of any but the barriers\r\nin front of them on the race-course at the appointed date, and which\r\nthey must spring over to get ahead of their rivals.\r\n\r\nAt the present day[6366], after the complete course of classical\r\nstudies, four years in school no longer suffice for obtaining the\r\ndegrees of a doctor in medicine or doctor in law. Five or six years are\r\nnecessary. Two years are necessary between the baccalauréat ès-lettres\r\nand the various licenses ès-lettres or sciences, and from these to the\r\ncorresponding aggrégations two, three years, and often more. Three years\r\nof preparatory studies in mathematics and of desperate application lead\r\nthe young man to the threshold of the École Polytechnique; after that,\r\nafter two years in school and of no less sustained effort, the future\r\nengineer passes three not less laborious years at the École des Ponts\r\net Chaussées or des Mines, which amounts to eight years of professional\r\npreparation.[6367] Elsewhere, in the other schools, it is the same thing\r\nwith more or less excess. Observe how days and hours are spent during\r\nthis long period.[6368] The young men have attended lecture-courses,\r\nmasticated and re-masticated manuals, abbreviated abridgments, learned\r\nby heart mementos and formulae, stored their memories with a vast\r\nmultitude of generalities and details. Every sort of preliminary\r\ninformation, all the theoretical knowledge which, even indirectly,\r\nmay serve them in their future profession or which is of service in\r\nneighboring professions, are classified in their brains, ready to come\r\nforth at the first call, and, as proved by the examination, disposable\r\nat a minute; they possess them, but nothing otherwise or beyond. Their\r\neducation has all tended to one side; they have undergone no practical\r\napprenticeship. Never have they taken an active part in or lent a hand\r\nto any professional undertaking either as collaborators or assistants.\r\n\r\n* The future professor, a new aggrégé at twenty-four years of age, who\r\nissues from the École Normale, has not yet taught a class, except for a\r\nfortnight in a Paris lycée.\r\n\r\n* The future engineer who, at twenty-four or twenty-five years of age\r\nleaves the École Centrale, or the École des Ponts, or École des Mines,\r\nhas never assisted in the working of a mine, in the heating of a blast\r\nfurnace, in the piercing of a tunnel, in the laying-out of a dike, of\r\na bridge or of a roadway. He is ignorant of the cost and has never\r\ncommanded a squad of workmen.\r\n\r\n* If the future advocate or magistrate to be has put up with being a\r\nnotary's or lawyer's clerk, he will at twenty-five years of age, even\r\nif he is a doctor of law with his insignia of three \"white balls,\"\r\nknow nothing of the business; he merely knows his codes; he has never\r\nexamined pleadings, conducted a case, drawn up an act or liquidated an\r\nestate.\r\n\r\n* From eighteen to thirty, the future architect who competes for a\r\nprix de Rome may stay in the École des Beaux-Arts, draw plan after plan\r\nthere, and then, if he obtains the prix, pass five years at Rome, make\r\ndesigns without end, multiply plans and restorations on paper, and at\r\nlast, at thirty-five years of age, return to Paris with the highest\r\ntitles, architect of the government, and with the aspiration to erect\r\nedifices without having taken even a second or third part in the actual\r\nconstruction of one single house.--\r\n\r\nNone of these men so full of knowledge know their trade and each, at\r\nthis late hour, is expected to act as an expert, improvising,[6369] in\r\nhaste and too fast, encountering many drawbacks at his own expense and\r\nat the expense of others, along with serious risks for the first tasks\r\nhe undertakes.\r\n\r\nBefore 1789, says a witness of both the ancient and the modern régime,\r\n[6370] young Frenchmen did not thus pass their early life. Instead\r\nof dancing attendance so long on the threshold of a career, they were\r\ninducted into it very early in life and at once began the race. With\r\nvery light baggage and readily obtained \"they entered the army at\r\nsixteen, and even fifteen years of age, at fourteen in the navy, and\r\na little later in special branches, artillery or engineering. In the\r\nmagistracy, at nineteen, the son of a conseiller-maître in parliament\r\nwas made a conseiller-adjoint without a vote until he reached\r\ntwenty-five; meanwhile, he was busy, active and sometimes was made a\r\nreporter of a case. No less precocious were the admissions to the Cour\r\ndes Comptes, to the Cour des Aides, to inferior jurisdictions and into\r\nthe bureaus of all the financial administrations.\" Here, as elsewhere,\r\nif any rank in law was exacted the delay that ensured was not apparent;\r\nthe Faculty examinations were only for forms sake; for a sum of money,\r\nand after a more or less grave ceremonial, a needed diploma was obtained\r\nalmost without study.[6371]--Accordingly, it was not in school, but in\r\nthe profession, that professional instruction was acquired; strictly\r\nspeaking, the young man for six or seven years, instead of being a\r\nstudent was an apprentice, that is to say a working novice under several\r\nmaster-workmen, in their workshop, working along with them and learning\r\nby doing, which is the best way of obtaining instruction. Struggling\r\nwith the difficulties of the work he at once became aware of his\r\nincompetence;[6372] he became modest and was attentive; with his\r\nmasters, he kept silent, and listened, which is the only way to\r\nunderstand. If he was intelligent he himself discovered what he lacked;\r\nas he found this out he felt the need of supplying what he needed; he\r\nsought, set his wits to work, and made choice of the various means;\r\nfreely and self-initiating he helped himself in his general or special\r\neducation. If he read books, it was not resignedly and for a recitation,\r\nbut with avidity and to comprehend them. If he followed lecture-courses\r\nit was not because he was obliged to, but voluntarily, because he was\r\ninterested and because he profited by it.--Chancellor Pasquier was\r\nmagistrate at seventeen (in 1784), attended at the lycée the lectures of\r\nGarat, La Harpe, Fourcroy and Duparcieux and, daily, at table or in the\r\nevening, listened to his father and his friends discussing matters\r\nwhich, in the morning, had been argued in the Palais de Justice or in\r\nthe Grand-Chambre. He imbibed a taste for his profession. Along with two\r\nor three prominent advocates and other young magistrates like himself,\r\nhe inscribed his name for lectures at the house of the first president\r\nof the first court of inquiry. Meanwhile, he went every evening into\r\nsociety; he saw there with his own eyes the ways and interests of men\r\nand women. On the other hand, at the Palais de Justice, a conseiller-\r\nécoutant he sat for five years, alongside of the conseiller-juges and\r\noften, the reporter of a case, he gave his opinion. After such a\r\nnovitiate, he was competent to form a judgment in civil or criminal\r\ncases with experience, competency and authority. From the age of\r\ntwenty-five, he was prepared for and capable of serious duties. He had\r\nonly to live and perfect himself to become an administrator, deputy or\r\nminister, a dignitary as we see under the first Empire, under the\r\nRestoration, under the July monarchy, that is to say the best informed,\r\nwell-balanced, judicious political character and, at length, the man of\r\nhighest consideration of his epoch.[6373]\r\n\r\nSuch is also the process which, still at the present day (1890),\r\nin England and in America secures future ability in the various\r\nprofessions. In the hospital, in the mine, in factories, with the\r\narchitect, with the lawyer, the pupil, taken very young, goes through\r\nhis apprenticeship and subsequent stages about the same as a clerk\r\nwith us in an office or an art-student in the studio. Preliminarily and\r\nbefore entering it, he has attended some general seminary lecture which\r\nserves him as a ready-made basis for the observations he is about to\r\nmake. Meanwhile, there are very often technical courses within reach,\r\nwhich he may attend at his leisure in order to give shape to his daily\r\nexperiences as these happen to accumulate. Under a régime of this stamp\r\npractical capacity grows and develops of itself, just to that degree\r\nwhich the faculties of the pupil warrant, and in the direction which his\r\nfuture aims require, through the special work to which he wishes for the\r\ntime being to adapt himself. In this way, in England and in the United\r\nStates, the young man soon succeeds in developing all he is good for.\r\nFrom the age of twenty-five and much sooner, if the substance and\r\nbottom are not wanting, he is not only a useful subordinate, but again a\r\nspontaneous creator, not merely a wheel but besides this a motor force.\r\nIn France, where the inverse process has prevailed and become more and\r\nmore Chinese at each generation, the total of the force lost is immense.\r\n\r\nThe most productive period of human life extends from fifteen or sixteen\r\nup to twenty-five or twenty-six; here are seven or eight years of\r\ngrowing energy and of constant production, buds, flowers and fruit;\r\nduring this period the young man sketches out his original ideas. But,\r\nthat these ideas may be born in him, sprout, and flourish they must,\r\nat this age, profit by the stimulating or repressive influence of the\r\natmosphere in which they are to live later on; here only are they formed\r\nin their natural and normal environment; their germs depend for their\r\ngrowth on the innumerable impressions due to the young man's sensations,\r\ndaily, in the workshop, in the mine, in the court-room, in the studio,\r\non the scaffolding of a building, in the hospital, on seeing tools,\r\nmaterials and operations, in talking with clients and workmen, in doing\r\nwork, good or bad, costly or remunerative; such are the minute and\r\nspecial perceptions of the eyes and the ears, of touch and even smell\r\nwhich, involuntarily gathered in and silently elaborated, work together\r\nin him and suggest, sooner or later, this or that new combination,\r\neconomy, perfection or invention.[6374] The young Frenchman, just at\r\nthis fecund age, is deprived of all these precious contacts, of all\r\nthese assimilating and indispensable elements. During seven or eight\r\nyears, he is shut up in school, remote from the direct and personal\r\nexperience which might have given him an exact and vivifying notion of\r\nmen and things, and of the various ways of handling them. All this time\r\nhis inventive faculties are deliberately sterilized; he can be nothing\r\nbut a passive recipient; whatever he might have produced under the other\r\nsystem he cannot produce under this one; the balance of debit and\r\ncredit is utter loss.--Meanwhile, the cost has been great. Whilst the\r\napprentice, the clerk busy with his papers in his office, the interne\r\nwith his apron standing by the bedside of the patient in the hospital,\r\npays by his services, at first for his instruction, then for his\r\nbreakfast, and ends in gaining something besides, at least his\r\npocket-money, the student under the Faculty, or the pupil in a special\r\nschool is educated and lives at the expense of his family or of the\r\nState; he gives back in exchange not work that is useful to mankind,\r\nnone that is worth anything on the market; his actual consumption is not\r\ncompensated for by his actual production. Undoubtedly, he cherishes the\r\nhope that some day or other he will obtain compensation, that we will\r\nrefund later and largely both capital and interest, and all the advances\r\nmade; in other words, his future services are discounted and, as far as\r\nhe is concerned, he speculates on a long credit.--It remains to be seen\r\nwhether the speculation is a good one; whether, at last, the receipts\r\nwill cover the expenses, in short, what will be the net or average\r\nreturns on the man thus fashioned.[6375]\r\n\r\nNow, among the forces expended, the most important to take into account\r\nis the time and attention of the pupil, the sum of his efforts, this or\r\nthat quantity of mental energy; he has only a limited provision of\r\nthis, and, not only is the proportion of this which the system consumes\r\nexcessive, but, again, the application of it which the system enforces\r\nis not remunerative. The provision is exhausted and by a wrong use of\r\nit, with scarcely any profit.--In our lycées, the pupil sits at his task\r\nmore than eleven hours a day; in a certain ecclesiastical college it is\r\ntwelve hours, and, from the age of twelve years, through the necessity\r\nof being first in competition as well as for securing the greatest\r\nnumber of admissions through various examinations.--At the end of this\r\nsecondary education there is a graduated scale of successive test, and\r\nfirst the baccalauréat. Fifty out of one hundred candidates fail and\r\nthe examiners are indulgent.[6376] This proves, first of all, that the\r\nrejected have profited by their studies; but it likewise proves that the\r\nprogram of the examination is not adapted to the general run of minds,\r\nnor to the native faculties of the human majority; that many young men\r\ncapable of learning by the opposite method learn nothing by this one;\r\nthat education, such as it is, with the kind and greatness of the mental\r\nlabor it imposes, with its abstract and theoretical style, is beyond\r\nthe capacity of the average mind.--Particularly, during the last year\r\nof classical studies, the pupils have had to follow the philosophy\r\nlectures: in the time of M. Laromiquière, this might be useful to them;\r\nin the time of M. Cousin, the course, so far, did but little harm; at\r\nthe present day, impregnated with neo-Kantism, it injects into minds of\r\neighteen, seventeen, and even sixteen years, a metaphysical muddle as\r\ncumbersome as the scholasticism of the fourteenth century, terribly\r\nindigestible and unhealthy for the stomachs of novices; the swallow\r\neven to bursting and throw it off at the examination just as it comes,\r\nentirely raw for lack of the capacity to assimilate it.--Often, after\r\nfailure at the baccalauréat, or on entering the preparatory or Grande\r\nÉcoles, the young people go into, or are put into, what they call \"a\r\nbox\" or an \"oven\" a preparatory internat, similar to the boxes in which\r\nsilkworms are raised and to the ovens where the eggs are hatched. In\r\nmore exact language it is a mechanical \"gaveuse\"[6377] in which they\r\nare daily crammed; through this constant, forced feeding, their\r\nreal knowledge is not increased, nor their mental vigor; they are\r\nsuperficially fattened and, at the end of the year, or in eighteen\r\nmonths, they present themselves on the appointed day, with the\r\nartificial and momentary volume they need for that day, with the bulk,\r\nsurface, polish and all the requisite externals, because these externals\r\nare the only ones that the examination verifies and imposes.[6378] Less\r\nharshly, but in the same manner and with the same object, operate\r\nthe special education services which, inside our colleges and lycées,\r\nprepare young men for the École de Saint-Cyr and for the polytechnic,\r\nnaval, central, normal, agricultural, commercial and forestry schools;\r\nin these too, the studies are cramming machines which prepare the pupil\r\nfor examination purposes. In the like manner, above secondary education,\r\nall our special schools are public cramming machines;[6379] alongside of\r\nthem are private schools advertised and puffed in the newspapers and by\r\nposters of the walls, preparing young men for the license degree in Law\r\nand for the third or fourth examinations in Medicine. Some day or other,\r\nothers will probably exist to prepare them for Treasury inspectors, for\r\nthe \"Cour des Comptes,\" for diplomacy, by competition, the same as for\r\nthe medical profession, for a hospital surgeon and for aggregation in\r\nlaw, medicine, letters or sciences.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, some minds, very active and very robust, withstand this\r\nrégime; all they have been made to swallow is absorbed and digested.\r\nAfter leaving school and having passed through all grades they preserve\r\nthe faculty of learning, investigating and inventing intact, and compose\r\nthe small élite of scholars, litterateurs, artists, engineers and\r\nphysicians who, in the international exposition of superior talent,\r\nmaintain France in its ancient rank.[6380]--But the rest, in very great\r\nmajority, nine out of ten at least, have lost their time and trouble,\r\nmany years of their life and years that are useful, important and even\r\ndecisive: take at once one-half or two-thirds of those who present\r\nthemselves at the examinations, I mean the rejected, and then, among the\r\nadmitted who get diplomas, another half or two-thirds that is to say,\r\nthe overworked. Too much has been required of them by exacting that, on\r\nsuch a day, seated or before the blackboard, for two entire hours, they\r\nshould be living repertories of all human knowledge; in effect, such\r\nthey are, or nearly so, that day, for two hours; but, a month later,\r\nthey are so no longer; they could not undergo the same examination;\r\ntheir acquisitions, too numerous and too burdensome, constantly drop of\r\ntheir minds and they make no new ones. Their mental vigor has given way,\r\nthe fecund sap has dried up; the finished man appears, often a finished\r\nman content to be put away, to be married, and plod along indefinitely\r\nin the same circle, entrenched in his restricted vocation and doing his\r\nduty, but nothing more. Such are the average returns--assuredly, the\r\nprofits do not make up for the expenses. In England and in America\r\nwhere, as before 1789 in France, the inverse method is followed, the\r\nreturns are equal or superior,[6381] and they are obtained with greater\r\nfacility, with more certainty, at an age less tardy, without imposing\r\nsuch great and unhealthy efforts on the young man, such large\r\nexpenditure by the State, and such long delays and sacrifices on\r\nfamilies.[6382]\r\n\r\nNow, in the four Faculties of Law, Medicine, Science and Letters, there\r\nare this year 22,000 students; add to these the pupils of the special\r\nschools and those who study with the hope of entering them, in all\r\nprobably 30,000. But there is no need of counting them; since the\r\nsuppression of the one-year voluntariat, the entire body of youths\r\ncapable of study, who wish to remain only one year in barracks and not\r\nremain there to get brutalized during three years, flocks to the benches\r\nof the lycée or to those of a Faculty.[6383] The sole object of the\r\nyoung man is not, as before, to reach the baccalauréat; it is essential\r\nthat he should be admitted, after a competition, into one of the\r\nspecial schools, or obtain the highest grades or diplomas in one of the\r\nFaculties; in all cases he is bound to successfully undergo difficult\r\nand multiplied examinations. At present time (1890), there is no place\r\nin France for an education in the inverse sense, nor for any other of a\r\ndifferent type. Henceforth, no young man, without condemning himself to\r\nthree years of barrack life, can travel at an early age for any length\r\nof time, or form his mind at home by free and original studies, stay\r\nin Germany and follow speculative studies in the universities, or go to\r\nEngland or to America to derive practical instruction from factory or\r\nfarm. Captured by our system, he is forced to surrender himself to the\r\nmechanical routine which fills his mind with fictitious tools, with\r\nuseless and cumbersome acquisitions that impose on him in exchange\r\nan exorbitant expenditure of mental energy and which is very like to\r\nconvert him into a mandarin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Public instruction in 1890.\r\n\r\n     Public instruction since 1870.--Agreement between the\r\n     Napoleonic and Jacobin conception.--Extension and\r\n     aggravation of the system.--The deductive process of the\r\n     Jacobin mind.--Its consequences.--In superior and in\r\n     secondary instruction.--In primary instruction.--Gratuitous,\r\n     obligatory and secular instruction.\r\n\r\nSuch is the singular and final result brought about by the institution\r\nof the year X (or 1801), due to the intervention of the grossly leveling\r\nJacobin spirit.[6384] Indeed, since 1871, and especially since 1879,\r\nthis spirit, through Napoleonic forms, has given breath, impulse and\r\ndirection, and these forms suit it. On the principle that education\r\nbelongs to the State, Napoleon and the old Jacobins were in accord;\r\nwhat he in fact established they had proclaimed as a dogma; hence the\r\nstructure of his university-organisation was not objectionable to them;\r\non the contrary, it conformed to their instincts. Hence, the reason why\r\nthe new Jacobins, inheritors of both instinct and dogma, immediately\r\nadopted the existing system; none was more convenient, better calculated\r\nto meet their views, better adapted in advance to do their work.\r\nConsequently, under the third Republic,[6385] as under anterior\r\ngovernments, the school machinery continues to turn and grind in the\r\nsame rut. Through the same working of its mechanism, under the same\r\nimpulse of its unique and central motor, conforming to the same\r\nNapoleonic and Jacobin idea of the teaching State, it is a formidable\r\nconcept which, more intrusive every year, more widely and more\r\nrigorously applied, more and more excludes the opposite concept. This\r\nwould be the remission of education to those interested in it, to those\r\nwho possess rights, to parents, to free and private enterprises which\r\ndepend only on personal exertions and on families, to permanent,\r\nspecial, local corporations, proprietary and organized under status,\r\ngoverned, managed, and supported by themselves. On this model, a few\r\nmen of intelligence and sensibility, enlightened by what is accomplished\r\nabroad, try to organize regional universities in our great academic\r\ncenters. The State might, perhaps, allow, if not the enterprise itself,\r\nthen at least something like it, but nothing more. Through its right\r\nof public administration, through the powers of its Council of State,\r\nthrough its fiscal legislation, through the immemorial prejudices of\r\nits jurists, through the routine of its bureaus, it is hostile to\r\na corporate personality. Never can such a project be considered a\r\nveritable civil personage; if the State consents to endow a group of\r\nindividuals with civil powers, it is always on condition that they be\r\nsubject to its narrow tutelage and be treated as minors and children.\r\n--Besides, these universities, even of age, are to remain as they are,\r\nso many dispensaries of diplomas. They are no longer to serve as an\r\nintellectual refuge, an oasis at the end of secondary instruction, a\r\nstation for three or four years for free curiosity and disinterested\r\nself-culture. Since the abolition of the volontariat for one year, a\r\nyoung Frenchman no longer enjoys the leisure to cultivate himself in\r\nthis way; free curiosity is interdicted; he is too much harassed by\r\na too positive interest, by the necessity of obtaining grades and\r\ndiplomas, by the preoccupations of examinations, by the limitations of\r\nage; he has no time to lose in experiments, in mental excursions, in\r\npure speculations. Henceforth, our system allows him only the régime to\r\nwhich we see him subject, namely the rush, the puffing and blowing, the\r\ngallop without stopping on a race-course, the perilous jumps at regular\r\ndistances over previously arranged and numbered obstacles. Instead of\r\nbeing restricted and attenuated, the disadvantages of the Napoleonic\r\ninstitution spread and grow worse, and this is due to the way in which\r\nour rulers comprehend it, the original, hereditary way of the Jacobin\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon built his University he did it as a statesman and a man\r\nof business, with the foresight of a contractor and a practical man,\r\ncalculating outlay and receipts, means and resources, so as to produce\r\nat once and with the least expense, the military and civil tools which\r\nhe lacked and of which he always had too few because he consumed too\r\nmany: to this precise, definite purpose he subjected and subordinated\r\nall the rest, including the theory of the educational State; she was for\r\nhim simply a résumé, a formula, a setting. On the contrary, for the\r\nold Jacobins, she was an axiom, a principle, an article in the Social\r\nContract; by this contract, the State had charge of public education;\r\nit had the right and its duty was to undertake this and manage it. The\r\nprinciple being laid down, as convinced theorists and blindly following\r\nthe deductive method, the derived consequences from it and rushed ahead,\r\nwith eyes shut, into practical operation, with as much haste as vigor,\r\nwithout concerning themselves with the nature of human materials, of\r\nsurrounding realities, of available resources, of collateral effects,\r\nnor of the total and final effect. Likewise with the new Jacobins of the\r\npresent day, according to them, since instruction is a good thing,[6386]\r\nthe broader and deeper it is the better; since broad and deep\r\ninstruction is very good, the State should, with all its energy and by\r\nevery means in its power, inculcate it on the greatest possible number\r\nof children, boys and adolescents. Such, henceforth, is the word of\r\ncommand from on high, transmitted down to the three stages of superior,\r\nsecondary and primary instruction.[6387]\r\n\r\nConsequently, from 1876 to 1890,[6388] the State expends for superior\r\ninstruction, in buildings alone, 99,000,000 francs. Formerly, the\r\nreceipts of the Faculties about covered their expenses; at the present\r\nday, the State allows them annually 6,000,000 francs more than their\r\nreceipts. It has founded and supports 221 new (professional) chairs, 168\r\ncomplementary courses of lectures, 129 conférences and, to supply\r\nthe attendants, it provides, since 1877, 300 scholarships for those\r\npreparing for the license and, since 1881, 200 scholarships for those\r\npreparing for the aggrégation. Similarly, in secondary instruction,\r\ninstead of 81 lycées in 1876, it has 100 in 1887[6389]; instead of\r\n3,820 scholarships in 1876, it distributes, in 1887, 10,528; instead\r\nof 2,200,000 francs expended for this branch of instruction in 1857, it\r\nexpends 18,000,000 in 1889.--This overload of teaching caused overloaded\r\nexams: it was necessary to include more science than in the past to\r\ncurriculum of the grades delivered and determined by the State. \"This\r\nwas what was then done whenever possible.\"[6390] Naturally, and through\r\ncontagion, the obligation of possessing more knowledge descended to\r\nsecondary instruction. In effect, after this date, we see neo-Kantian\r\nphilosophy descending like hail from the highest metaphysical ether\r\ndown upon the pupils in the terminal class of the lycées, to the lasting\r\ninjury of the seventeen-year old brains. Again, after this date, we see\r\nin the class of special mathematics[6391] an abundance of complicated,\r\nconfusing problems so that, today, the candidate for the Polytechnic\r\nSchool must, to gain admission, expound theorems that were only mastered\r\nby his father after he got there.--Hence, \"boxes\" and \"ovens\", private\r\ninternats, the preparatory secular or ecclesiastical schools and other\r\n\"scholastic cramming-machines\"; hence, the prolonged mechanical effort\r\nto introduce into each intellectual sponge all the scientific fluid it\r\ncan contain, even to saturation, and maintain it in this extreme state\r\nof perfection if only for two hours during an examination, after which\r\nit may rapidly subside and shrink. Hence, that mistaken use, that\r\ninordinate expenditure, that precocious waste of mental energy, and that\r\nentire pernicious system which overburden for a substantial period the\r\nyoung, not for their advantage, but, on reaching maturity, to their\r\nintellectual detriment.\r\n\r\nTo reach the uncultivated masses, to address popular intellect and\r\nimagination, one must use absolute, simple slogans. In the matter of\r\nprimary instruction, the simplest and most absolute slogan is that\r\nwhich promises and offers it to all children, boys and girls, not merely\r\nuniversal, but again, complete and gratuitous. To this end, from 1878\r\nto 1891,[6392] the State has expended for school buildings and\r\ninstallations 582,000,000 francs; for salaries and other expenses it\r\nfurnished the latter year 131,000,000. Somebody pays for all this, and\r\nit is the tax-payer, and by force; aided by gendarmes, the collector\r\nputs his hand forcibly into all pockets, even those containing only\r\nsous, and withdraws these millions. Gratuitous instruction sounds well\r\nand seems to designate a veritable gift, a present from the great vague\r\npersonage called the State, and whom the general public dimly sees\r\non the distant horizon as a superior, independent being, and hence a\r\npossible benefactor. In reality, his presents are made with our money,\r\nwhile his generosity consists in the fine name with which he here gilds\r\nhis fiscal exactions, a new constraint added to so many others which he\r\nimposes on us and which we endure.[6393]--Besides, through instinct and\r\ntradition, the State is naturally inclined to multiply constraints, and\r\nthis time there is no concealment. From six to thirteen years of age,\r\nprimary instruction becomes obligatory.[6394] The father is required to\r\nprove that his children receive it, if not at the public school at least\r\nin a private school or at home. During these seven years it continues,\r\nand ten months are devoted to it each year. The school takes and keeps\r\nthe child three hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon;\r\nit pours into these little heads all that is possible in such a length\r\nof time, all that they can hold and more too,--spelling, syntax,\r\ngrammatical and logical analysis, rules of composition and of\r\nstyle, history, geography, arithmetic, geometry, drawing, notions of\r\nliterature, politics, law, and finally a complete moral system, \"civic\r\nmorality.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obviously very useful for every adult to be able to read, write\r\nand reckon. Who, then, can criticize a Government because it insists\r\nthat all children be taught these basic skills? But for the same reason\r\nand on the same principle, provision could be made for swimming-schools\r\nin every village and town on the sea-coast, or on the streams and\r\nrivers; every boy should be obliged to learn how to swim.--That it may\r\nbe useful for every boy and girl in the United States to pass through\r\nthe entire system of primary instruction is peculiar to the United\r\nStates and is comprehensible in an extensive and new country where\r\nmultiplied and diverse pursuits present themselves on all sides;[6395]\r\nwhere every career may lead to the highest pinnacle; where a\r\nrail-splitter may become president of the republic; where the adult\r\noften changes his career and, to afford him the means for improvising a\r\ncompetency at each change, he must possess the elements of every kind of\r\nknowledge; where the wife, being for the man an object of luxury, does\r\nnot use her arms in the fields and scarcely ever uses her hands in the\r\nhousehold.[6396]--It is not the same in France. Nine out of ten pupils\r\nin the primary school are sons or daughters of peasants or of workmen\r\nand will remain in the condition of their parents; the girl, adult, will\r\ndo washing and cooking all her life at home or abroad; the son, adult,\r\nconfined to his occupation will work all his life in a shop or on\r\nhis own or another's field. Between this destiny of the adult and the\r\nplenitude of his primary instruction, the disproportion is enormous; it\r\nis evident that his education does not prepare him for the life he has\r\nto lead; but for another life, less monotonous, under less restraint,\r\nmore cerebral, and of which a faint glimpse disgusts him with his\r\nown;[6397] at least, it will disgust him for a long time and frequently,\r\nuntil the day comes when his school acquisitions, wholly superficial,\r\nshall have evaporated in contact with the ambient atmosphere and\r\nno longer appear to him other than empty phrases; in France, for an\r\nordinary peasant or workman, so much the better if this day comes\r\nearly.[6398]\r\n\r\nAt the very least, three quarters of these acquisitions are for him\r\nsuperfluous. He derives no advantage from them, neither for inward\r\nsatisfaction or for getting ahead in the world; and yet they must all be\r\ngone through with. In vain would the father of a family like to curtail\r\nhis children's mental stores to useful knowledge, to reading, writing\r\nand arithmetic, to giving to these just the necessary time, at the\r\nright season, three months for two or three winters, to keep his\r\ntwelve-year-old daughter at home to help her mother and take care of the\r\nother children, to keep his boy of ten years for pasturing cattle or for\r\ngoading on the oxen at the plow.[6399] In relation to his children and\r\ntheir interests as well as for his own necessities, he is suspect, he is\r\nnot a good judge; the State has more light and better intentions than he\r\nhas. Consequently, the State has the right to constrain him and in fact,\r\nfrom above, from Paris, the State does this. Legislators, as formerly in\r\n1793, have acted according to Jacobin procedure, as despotic theorists.\r\nThey have formed in their minds a uniform, universal, simple type, that\r\nof a child from six to thirteen years as they want to see it, without\r\nadjusting the instruction they impose on it to its prospective\r\ncondition, making abstraction of his positive and personal interest, of\r\nhis near and certain future, setting the father aside, the natural\r\njudge and competent measurer of the education suitable to his son and\r\ndaughter, the sole authorized arbiter for determining the quality,\r\nduration, circumstances and counterpoise of the mental and moral\r\nmanipulation to which these young lives, inseparable from his own, are\r\ngoing to be subject away from home.--Never, since the Revolution,\r\nhas the State so vigorously affirmed its omnipotence, nor pushed in\r\nencroachments on and intrusion into the proper domain of the individual\r\nso far, even to the very center of domestic life. Note that in 1793\r\nand 1794 the plans of Lepelletier de Saint-Fargeau and of Saint-Just\r\nremained on paper; the latter for ten years have been in practical\r\noperation.[63100]\r\n\r\nAt bottom, the Jacobin is a sectarian, propagator of his own faith, and\r\nhostile to the faith of others. Instead of admitting that that people's\r\nconceptions are different and rejoicing that there are so many of them,\r\neach adapted to the human group which believes in it, and essential to\r\nbelievers to help them along, he admits but one, his own, and he\r\nuses power to force it upon adherents. He also has his own creed,\r\nhis catechism, his imperative formula, and he imposes them.--\r\nHenceforth,[63101] education shall be not only free and obligatory but\r\nagain secular and nothing but secular. Thus far, the great majority of\r\nparents, most of the fathers and all of the mothers, were desirous that\r\nit should at the same time be religious. Without speaking of professing\r\nChristians, many heads of families, even lukewarm, indifferent or\r\nskeptical, judge that this mixture of the two is better for children,\r\nand especially for girls. According to them, knowledge and faith should\r\nnot enter into these young minds separate, but combined and as one\r\naliment; at least, in the particular case in which they were concerned,\r\nthis, in their view, was better for the child, for themselves, for the\r\ninternal discipline of the household, for good order at home for which\r\nthey were responsible, for the maintenance of respect, and for the\r\npreservation of morals. For this reason, the municipal councils,\r\nprevious to the laws of 1882 and 1886, still free to choose instruction\r\nand teachers as they pleased, often entrusted their school to the\r\nChristian Brethren or Sisters under contract for a number of years, at\r\na fixed price, and all the more willingly because this price was very\r\nlow.[63102] Hence, in 1886, there were in the public schools 10,029\r\nteachers of the Christian Brethren and 39,125 of the Sisters. Now, since\r\n1886, the law insists that public instruction shall be not only secular,\r\nbut that lay teachers only shall teach; the communal schools, in\r\nparticular, shall be all secularized, and, to complete this operation,\r\nthe legislator fixes the term of delay; after that, no member of a\r\ncongregation, monk or nun, shall teach in any public school.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, each year, by virtue of the law, the communal schools are\r\nsecularized by hundreds, by fair means or foul; although this is by\r\nright a local matter, the municipal councils are not consulted; the\r\nheads of families have no voice in this private, domestic interest which\r\ntouches them to the quick, and such a sensitive point. And likewise, in\r\nthe cost of the operation their part is officially imposed them; at the\r\npresent day,[63103] in the sum-total of 131,000,000 francs which primary\r\ninstruction costs annually, the communes contribute 50,000,000 francs;\r\nfrom 1878 to 1891, in the sum-total of 582,000,000 francs expended\r\non school buildings, they contributed 312,000,000 francs.--If certain\r\nparents are not pleased with this system they have only to subscribe\r\namongst themselves, build a private school at their own expense, and\r\nsupport Christian Brothers or Sisters in these as teachers. That is\r\ntheir affair; they will not pay one cent less to the commune, to the\r\ndepartment or to the State, so that their tax will be double and they\r\nwill pay twice, first for the primary instruction which they dislike,\r\nand next for the primary instruction which suits them.--Thousands of\r\nprivate schools are founded on these conditions. In 1887,[63104] these\r\nhad 1,091,810 pupils, about one fifth of all children inscribed in\r\nall the primary schools. Thus one fifth of the parents do not want the\r\nsecular system for their children; at least, they prefer the other\r\nwhen the other is offered to them; but, to offer it to them, very large\r\ndonations, a multitude of voluntary subscriptions, are necessary. The\r\ndistrust and aversion which this system, imposed from above excites can\r\nbe measured by the number of parents and children and by the greatness\r\nof the donations and subscriptions. Note, moreover, that in many of\r\nthe other communes, in all places where the resources, the common\r\nunderstanding and the generosity of individual founders and donators\r\nare not sufficient, the parents, even distrustful and hostile, are now\r\nconstrained to send their children to the school which is repugnant\r\nto them.--In order to be more precise, imagine an official and daily\r\njournal entitled Secular journal, obligatory and gratuitous for children\r\nfrom six to thirteen, founded and supported by the State, at an average\r\ncost of 582,000,000 francs to set it agoing, and 131,0000,000 francs\r\nof annual expenditure, the whole taken from the purses of taxpayers,\r\nwillingly or not; take it for granted that the 6,000,000 children, girls\r\nand boys, from six to thirteen, are forced subscribers to this journal,\r\nthat they get it every day except Sundays, that, every day, they are\r\nbound to read the paper for six hours. The State, through toleration,\r\nallows the parents who do not like the official sheet to take another\r\nwhich suits them; but, that another may be within reach, it is necessary\r\nthat local benefactors, associated together and taxed by themselves,\r\nshould be willing to establish and support it; otherwise, the father\r\nof a family is constrained to read the secular journal to his\r\nchildren, which he deems badly composed and marred by superfluities and\r\nshortcomings, in brief edited in an objectionable spirit. Such is the\r\nway in which the Jacobin State respects the liberty of the individual.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, through this operation, it has extended and fortified\r\nitself; it has multiplied the institutions it directs and the persons\r\nwhom it controls. To direct, inspect, augment and diffuse its primary\r\ninstruction, the State has maintained 173 normal schools for teachers,\r\nmale and female, 736 schools and courses of lectures in primary,\r\nsuperior and professional instruction, 66,784 elementary schools, 3,597\r\nmaternal schools, and about 115,000 functionaries, men and women.[63105]\r\nThrough these 115,000 officials, representatives and megaphones,\r\nSecular Reason, which is enthroned at Paris, sends its voice even to\r\nthe smallest and most remote villages. It is this Reason, as our rulers\r\ndefine it, with the inclinations, limitations and prejudices they have\r\nneed of, the near-sighted and half-domesticated grand-daughter of that\r\nother formidable sightless, brutal and mad grandmother, who, in 1793\r\nand 1794, sat under the same name and in the same place. With less of\r\nviolence and blundering, but by virtue of the same instinct and with\r\nthe same one-sidedness, the latter employs the same propaganda. She\r\ntoo wants to seize the new generations, and through her programs and\r\nmanuals, her insinuations and summaries of the Ancient Régime, the\r\nRevolution and the Empire, by her perceptions of recent or contemporary\r\nmatters, through her formulae and suggestions in relation to moral,\r\nsocial and political affairs, it is of her and she alone, that she\r\npreaches and glorifies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Summary.\r\n\r\n     Total and actual effect of the system.--Increasing\r\n     unsuitableness between early education and adult life.\r\n     --Change for the worse in the mental and moral balance of\r\n     contemporary youth.\r\n\r\nIn this manner does the education by the State end. (in 1890) When a\r\nmatter is taken out of the hands of those who are concerned and handed\r\nover to a third and differently motivated party, it cannot end well;\r\nsooner or later, this basic defect will dominate and lead to unexpected\r\nresults. In this case a growing disparity between education and life.\r\nOn the three levels of instruction, infancy, adolescence and youth, the\r\nactual theoretical and direct instruction is extended and overloaded\r\nwith the examination, the grade, the diploma and the certificate in view\r\nonly. To this end any and all means is used; through the application of\r\nan unnatural and anti-social system competition, through excessive delay\r\nin practical apprenticeship, through the internat, through artificial\r\nstimulation and mechanical cramming, and through overwork. There is no\r\nconsideration of the future, of the adult epoch and the duties of the\r\ncomplete man. The real world in which the young man is about to enter,\r\nthe state of society to which he must adapt or resign himself, the human\r\nstruggle in which he must defend himself or keep erect is left out. For\r\nthis new life he is neither armed, equipped, drilled and hardened.\r\nThat solid common sense, that determination and those steady nerves,\r\nindispensable tools in life, are not dispensed by our schools; quite the\r\ncontrary; far from qualifying him for his approaching independence the\r\nschools disqualify him for it. Accordingly, his entrance into the world\r\nand his first steps on the field of practical life are generally a\r\nseries of painful failures; as a consequence he remains bruised, often\r\nfor a long time, offended sometimes permanently crippled. This is a rude\r\nand dangerous ordeal; the moral and mental balance is altered and\r\nrisks never being restored; his illusions vanish too suddenly and too\r\ncompletely. His deceptions have been too great and his disappointment\r\ntoo severe. Sometimes, among close friends, embittered and worn out like\r\nhimself, he is tempted to tell us:\r\n\r\n\"Through your education you have led us to believe, or you have let us\r\nbelieve, that the world is made in a certain fashion. You have deceived\r\nus. It is much uglier, more dull, dirtier, sadder and harder, at least\r\nin our opinion and to our imagination: you judge us as overexcited and\r\ndisordered; if so, it is your fault. For this reason, we curse and scoff\r\nat your world and reject your pretended truths which, for us, are lies,\r\nincluding those elementary and primordial verities which you declare\r\nare evident to common sense, and on which you base your laws, your\r\ninstitutions, your society, your philosophy, your sciences and your\r\narts.\"\r\n\r\nThis is what our contemporary youth, through their tastes, opinions,\r\nvague desires in letters, arts and life, have loudly proclaimed for the\r\npast fifteen years.[63106] (Written in 1890.)\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT:\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to the French to note that they have, since the law\r\ncalled Debré in 1959 allowed the Catholic schools to operate freely with\r\nteachers paid by the state provided they,\r\n\r\n* use qualified teachers,\r\n\r\n* have a contract with the government submitting to inspection of their\r\nbuildings etc.,\r\n\r\n* submit to government study programs,\r\n\r\n* regular accepted hours etc. (SR.)\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6301: Ordinance of Oct. 4, 1814.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6302: Liard, \"L'Enseignement supérieur pendant la\r\nRestauration.\" (Rev. des deux Mondes, number for Feb.15, 1892.)

What if he, like so\r\nmany other highly talented and intelligent men, took his own superb\r\nintelligence and imagination for granted? What if the talent of such\r\nmen is inherited? We know from identical twins how many of our\r\nparticularities have been given to us at birth. What if most men are\r\nlazy and especially intellectually so, what if we can only be made to\r\nlearn and think when under great stress, the stress introduced by fear\r\nof dismissal or hope of promotion or riches? Then the French system is\r\nperhaps hard, perhaps expensive but certainly useful in producing\r\nthe great number of hardworking and competent and passively obedient\r\nsupervisors and civil servants that any large organization needs. (SR.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6381: \"Souvenirs\", by Pasquier (Etienne-Dennis, duc),\r\nchancelier de France, in VI volumes, Librarie Plon, Paris 1893. Although\r\npupils were admitted in the preparatory Schools very early, \"our navy,\r\nengineer and artillery officers were justly esteemed the best instructed\r\nin Europe, as able practically as theoretically; the position occupied\r\nby artillery and engineer officers from 1792 in the French army\r\nsufficiently attests this truth. And yet they did not know one tenth of\r\nthose who now issue from the preparatory schools. Vauban himself would\r\nhave been unable to undergo the examination for admission into the\r\nPolytechnic School.\" There is then in our system \"a luxury of science,\r\nvery fine in itself, but which is not necessary to insure good service\r\non land or at sea.\" The same in civil careers, with the bar, in the\r\nmagistracy, in the administration and even in literature and the\r\nsciences. The proof of this is found in the men of great talent who,\r\nafter 1789, were prominent in the Constituent Assembly. In the new-born\r\nUniversity there was not one half of the demand for attainments as is\r\nnow exacted. There is nothing like our over-loaded baccalauréat, and yet\r\nthere issued from it Villemain, Cousin, Hugo, Lamartine, etc. No École\r\nPolytechnique existed, and yet at the end of the eighteenth century in\r\nFrance, we find the richest constellation of savants, Lagrange, Laplace,\r\nMonge, Fourcroy, Lavoisier, Berthollet, Haüy, and others. (Since the\r\ndate of these souvenirs (1843) the defects in the French system have\r\ngotten worse.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6382: In England and in the United States the architect\r\nand engineer produce more than we do with greater pliancy, fertility,\r\noriginality and boldness of invention, with a practical capacity at\r\nleast equal and without having passed six, eight or ten years in purely\r\ntheoretical studies.--Cf. Des Rousiers, \"La Vie Américaine,\" p. 619:\r\n\"Our polytechnicians are scientific erudites.... The American engineer\r\nis not omniscient as they were, he is special.\" \"But, in his specialty\r\nhe has profound knowledge; he is always trying to make it more perfect\r\nby additions, and he does more than the polytechnician to advance his\r\nscience\" or his art. (Since Taine noted this times have changed; I once\r\nput my 3 older sons into the American school in Bangkok (in 1972),\r\nand not only did they not learn anything during their year there, they\r\nactually lost some of their reading and writing skills and I had to\r\nremove them as soon as I could.
