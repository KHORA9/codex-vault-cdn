No such resource is open in a work of fact; and the subject of\r\nthis work is one on which the truth, if told at all, must needs be very\r\ndreadful. There is no bright side to slavery, as such. Those scenes\r\nwhich are made bright by the generosity and kindness of masters and\r\nmistresses, would be brighter still if the element of slavery were\r\nwithdrawn. There is nothing picturesque or beautiful, in the family\r\nattachment of old servants, which is not to be found in countries where\r\nthese servants are legally free. The tenants on an English estate are\r\noften more fond and faithful than if they were slaves. Slavery,\r\ntherefore, is not the element which forms the picturesque and beautiful\r\nof Southern life. What is peculiar to slavery, and distinguishes it from\r\nfree servitude, is evil, and only evil, and that continually.\r\n\r\nIn preparing this work, it has grown much beyond the author’s original\r\ndesign. It has so far overrun its limits that she has been obliged to\r\nomit one whole department;—that of the characteristics and developments\r\nof the colored race in various countries and circumstances. This is more\r\nproperly the subject for a volume; and she hopes that such an one will\r\nsoon be prepared by a friend to whom she has transferred her materials.\r\n\r\nThe author desires to express her thanks particularly to those legal\r\ngentlemen who have given her their assistance and support in the legal\r\npart of the discussion. She also desires to thank those, at the North\r\nand at the South, who have kindly furnished materials for her use. Many\r\nmore have been supplied than could possibly be used. The book is\r\nactually selected out of a mountain of materials.\r\n\r\nThe great object of the author in writing has been to bring this subject\r\nof slavery, as a moral and religious question, before the minds of all\r\nthose who profess to be followers of Christ, in this country. A minute\r\nhistory has been given of the action of the various denominations on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nThe writer has aimed, as far as possible, to say what is true, and only\r\nthat, without regard to the effect which it may have upon any person or\r\nparty. She hopes that what she has said will be examined without\r\nbitterness,—in that serious and earnest spirit which is appropriate for\r\nthe examination of so very serious a subject. It would be vain for her\r\nto indulge the hope of being wholly free from error. In the wide field\r\nwhich she has been called to go over, there is a possibility of many\r\nmistakes. She can only say that she has used the most honest and earnest\r\nendeavors to learn the truth.\r\n\r\nThe book is commended to the candid attention and earnest prayers of all\r\ntrue Christians, throughout the world. May they unite their prayers that\r\nChristendom may be delivered from so great an evil as slavery!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt different times, doubt has been expressed whether the representations\r\nof “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” are a fair representation of slavery as it at\r\npresent exists. This work, more, perhaps, than any other work of fiction\r\nthat ever was written, has been a collection and arrangement of real\r\nincidents,—of actions really performed, of words and expressions really\r\nuttered,—grouped together with reference to a general result, in the\r\nsame manner that the mosaic artist groups his fragments of various\r\nstones into one general picture. His is a mosaic of gems,—this is a\r\nmosaic of facts.\r\n\r\nArtistically considered, it might not be best to point out in which\r\nquarry and from which region each fragment of the mosaic picture had its\r\norigin; and it is equally unartistic to disentangle the glittering web\r\nof fiction, and show out of what real warp and woof it is woven, and\r\nwith what real coloring dyed. But the book had a purpose entirely\r\ntranscending the artistic one, and accordingly encounters, at the hands\r\nof the public, demands not usually made on fictitious works. It is\r\n_treated_ as a reality,—sifted, tried and tested, as a reality; and\r\ntherefore as a reality it may be proper that it should be defended.\r\n\r\nThe writer acknowledges that the book is a very inadequate\r\nrepresentation of slavery; and it is so, necessarily, for this\r\nreason,—that slavery, in some of its workings, is too dreadful for the\r\npurposes of art. A work which should represent it strictly as it is\r\nwould be a work which could not be read. And all works which ever mean\r\nto give pleasure must draw a veil somewhere, or they cannot succeed.\r\n\r\nThe author will now proceed along the course of the story, from the\r\nfirst page onward, and develop, as far as possible, the incidents by\r\nwhich different parts were suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                               MR. HALEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the very first chapter of the book we encounter the character of\r\nthe negro-trader, Mr. Haley. His name stands at the head of this\r\nchapter as the representative of all the different characters\r\nintroduced in the work which exhibit the trader, the kidnapper, the\r\nnegro-catcher, the negro-whipper, and all the other inevitable\r\nauxiliaries and indispensable appendages of what is often called the\r\n“divinely-instituted relation” of slavery. The author’s first personal\r\nobservation of this class of beings was somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, while one morning employed in the duties of the\r\nnursery, a colored woman was announced. She was ushered into the\r\nnursery, and the author thought, on first survey, that a more surly,\r\nunpromising face she had never seen. The woman was thoroughly black,\r\nthick-set, firmly built, and with strongly-marked African features.\r\nThose who have been accustomed to read the expressions of the African\r\nface know what a peculiar effect is produced by a lowering, desponding\r\nexpression upon its dark features. It is like the shadow of a\r\nthunder-cloud. Unlike her race generally, the woman did not smile when\r\nsmiled upon, nor utter any pleasant remark in reply to such as were\r\naddressed to her. The youngest pet of the nursery, a boy about three\r\nyears old, walked up, and laid his little hand on her knee, and seemed\r\nastonished not to meet the quick smile which the negro almost always has\r\nin reserve for the little child. The writer thought her very cross and\r\ndisagreeable, and, after a few moments’ silence, asked, with perhaps a\r\nlittle impatience, “Do you want anything of me to-day?”\r\n\r\n“Here are some papers,” said the woman, pushing them towards her;\r\n“perhaps you would read them.”\r\n\r\nThe first paper opened was a letter from a negro-trader in Kentucky,\r\nstating concisely that he had waited about as long as he could for her\r\nchild; that he wanted to start for the South, and must get it off his\r\nhands; that, if she would send him two hundred dollars before the end of\r\nthe week, she should have it; if not, that he would set it up at\r\nauction, at the court-house door, on Saturday. He added, also, that he\r\nmight have got more than that for the child, but that he was willing to\r\nlet her have it cheap.\r\n\r\n“What sort of a man is this?” said the author to the woman, when she had\r\ndone reading the letter.\r\n\r\n“Dunno, ma’am; great Christian, I know,—member of the Methodist church,\r\nanyhow.”\r\n\r\nThe expression of sullen irony with which this was said was a thing to\r\nbe remembered.\r\n\r\n“And how old is this child?” said the author to her.\r\n\r\nThe woman looked at the little boy who had been standing at her knee,\r\nwith an expressive glance, and said, “She will be three years old this\r\nsummer.”\r\n\r\nOn further inquiry into the history of the woman, it appeared that she\r\nhad been set free by the will of her owners; that the child was legally\r\nentitled to freedom, but had been seized on by the heirs of the estate.\r\nShe was poor and friendless, without money to maintain a suit, and the\r\nheirs, of course, threw the child into the hands of the trader. The\r\nnecessary sum, it may be added, was all raised in the small neighborhood\r\nwhich then surrounded the Lane Theological Seminary, and the child was\r\nredeemed.\r\n\r\nIf the public would like a specimen of the correspondence which passes\r\nbetween these worthies, who are the principal reliance of the community\r\nfor supporting and extending the institution of slavery, the following\r\nmay be interesting as a matter of literary curiosity. It was forwarded\r\nby Mr. M. J. Thomas, of Philadelphia, to the _National Era_, and stated\r\nby him to be “a copy taken verbatim from the original, found among the\r\npapers of the person to whom it was addressed, at the time of his arrest\r\nand conviction, for passing a variety of counterfeit bank-notes.”\r\n\r\n                                     _Poolsville, Montgomery Co., Md.,\r\n                                                   March 24, 1831._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: I arrived home in safety with Louisa, John having been\r\n  rescued from me, out of a two-story window, at twelve o’clock at\r\n  night. I offered a reward of fifty dollars, and have him here safe\r\n  in jail. The persons who took him brought him to Fredericktown jail.\r\n  I wish you to write to no person in this state but myself. Kephart\r\n  and myself are determined to go the whole hog for any negro you can\r\n  find, and you must give me the earliest information, as soon as you\r\n  do find any. Enclosed you will receive a handbill, and I can make a\r\n  good bargain, if you can find them. I will in all cases, as soon as\r\n  a negro runs off, send you a handbill immediately, so that you may\r\n  be on the look-out. Please tell the constable to go on with the sale\r\n  of John’s property; and, when the money is made, I will send on an\r\n  order to you for it. Please attend to this for me; likewise write to\r\n  me, and inform me of any negro you think has run away,—no matter\r\n  where you think he has come from, nor how far,—and I will try and\r\n  find out his master. Let me know where you think he is from, with\r\n  all particular marks, and if I don’t find his master, _Joe’s dead!_\r\n\r\n  Write to me about the crooked-fingered negro, and let me know which\r\n  hand and which finger, color, &c.; likewise any mark the fellow has\r\n  who says he got away from the negro-buyer, with his height and\r\n  color, or any other you think has run off.\r\n\r\n  Give my respects to your partner, and be sure you write to no person\r\n  but myself. If any person writes to you, you can inform me of it,\r\n  and I will try to _buy_ from them. I think we can make money, if we\r\n  do business together; for I have plenty of money, if you can find\r\n  plenty of negroes. Let me know if Daniel is still where he was, and\r\n  if you have heard anything of Francis since I left you. Accept for\r\n  yourself my regard and esteem.\r\n\r\n                                                    REUBEN B. CARLLEY.\r\n\r\n  JOHN C. SAUNDERS.\r\n\r\nThis letter strikingly illustrates the character of these\r\nfellow-patriots with whom the great men of our land have been acting in\r\nconjunction, in carrying out the beneficent provisions of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _Kephart_ named in this letter the community of\r\nBoston may have a special interest to know further particulars, as he\r\nwas one of the dignitaries sent from the South to assist the good\r\ncitizens of that place in the religious and patriotic enterprise of\r\n1851, at the time that Shadrach was unfortunately rescued. It therefore\r\nmay be well to introduce somewhat particularly JOHN KEPHART, as sketched\r\nby RICHARD H. DANA, Jr., one of the lawyers employed in the defence of\r\nthe perpetrators of the rescue.\r\n\r\n  I shall never forget John Caphart. I have been eleven years at the\r\n  bar, and in that time have seen many developments of vice and\r\n  hardness, but I never met with anything so cold-blooded as the\r\n  testimony of that man. John Caphart is a tall, sallow man, of about\r\n  fifty, with jet-black hair, a restless, dark eye, and an anxious,\r\n  care-worn look, which, had there been enough of moral element in the\r\n  expression, might be called melancholy. His frame was strong, and in\r\n  youth he had evidently been powerful, but he was not robust. Yet\r\n  there was a calm, cruel look, a power of will and a quickness of\r\n  muscular action, which still render him a terror in his vocation.\r\n\r\n  In the manner of giving in his testimony there was no bluster or\r\n  outward show of insolence. His contempt for the humane feelings of\r\n  the audience and community about him was too true to require any\r\n  assumption of that kind. He neither paraded nor attempted to conceal\r\n  the worst features of his calling. He treated it as a matter of\r\n  business which he knew the community shuddered at, but the moral\r\n  nature of which he was utterly indifferent to, beyond a certain\r\n  secret pleasure in thus indirectly inflicting a little torture on\r\n  his hearers.\r\n\r\n  I am not, however, altogether clear, to do John Caphart justice,\r\n  that he is entirely conscience-proof. There was something in his\r\n  anxious look which leaves one not without hope.\r\n\r\n  At the first trial we did not know of his pursuits, and he passed\r\n  merely as a police-man of Norfolk, Virginia. But, at the second\r\n  trial, some one in the room gave me a hint of the occupations many\r\n  of these police-men take to, which led to my cross-examination.\r\n\r\n    _From the Examination of John Caphart, in the “Rescue Trials,”\r\n      at Boston, in June and Nov., 1851, and October, 1852._\r\n\r\n  _Question._ Is it a part of your duty, as a police-man, to take up\r\n  colored persons who are out after hours in the streets?\r\n\r\n  _Answer._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What is done with them?\r\n\r\n  _A._ We put them in the lock-up, and in the morning they are brought\r\n  into court and ordered to be punished,—those that are to be\r\n  punished.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What punishment do they get?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Not exceeding thirty-nine lashes.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Who gives them these lashes?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Any of the officers. I do, sometimes.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Are you paid _extra_ for this? How much?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Fifty cents a head. It used to be sixty-two cents. Now it is\r\n  fifty. Fifty cents for each one we arrest, and fifty more for each\r\n  one we flog.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Are these persons you flog men and boys only, or are they women\r\n  and girls also?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Men, women, boys and girls, just as it happens.\r\n\r\n  [The government interfered, and tried to prevent any further\r\n  examination; and said, among other things, that he only performed\r\n  his duty as police-officer under the law. After a discussion, Judge\r\n  Curtis allowed it to proceed.]\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Is your flogging confined to these cases? Do you not flog\r\n  slaves at the request of their masters?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Sometimes I do. Certainly, when I am called upon.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ In these cases of private flogging, are the negroes sent to\r\n  you? Have you a place for flogging?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No. I go round, as I am sent for.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Is this part of your duty as an officer?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ In these cases of private flogging, do you inquire into the\r\n  circumstances, to see what the fault has been, or if there is any?\r\n\r\n  _A._ That’s none of my business. I do as I am requested. The master\r\n  is responsible.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ In these cases, too, I suppose you flog women and girls, as\r\n  well as men.\r\n\r\n  _A._ Women and men.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Mr. Caphart, how long have you been engaged in this business?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Ever since 1836.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ How many negroes do you suppose you have flogged, in all, women\r\n  and children included?\r\n\r\n  _A._ [Looking calmly round the room.] I don’t know how many niggers\r\n  you have got here in Massachusetts, but I should think I had flogged\r\n  as many as you’ve got in the state.\r\n\r\n  [The same man testified that he was often employed to pursue\r\n  fugitive slaves. His reply to the question was, “I never refuse a\r\n  good job in that line.”]\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Don’t they sometimes turn out bad jobs?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Never, if I can help it.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Are they not sometimes discharged after you get them?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Not often. I don’t know that they ever are, except those\r\n  Portuguese the counsel read about.\r\n\r\n  [I had found, in a Virginia report, a case of some two hundred\r\n  Portuguese negroes, whom this John Caphart had seized from a vessel,\r\n  and endeavored to get condemned as slaves, but whom the court\r\n  discharged.]\r\n\r\nHon. John P. Hale, associated with Mr. Dana, as counsel for the defence,\r\nin the Rescue Trials, said of him, in his closing argument:\r\n\r\n  Why, gentlemen, _he sells agony_! Torture is his stock-in-trade! He\r\n  is a walking scourge! He hawks, peddles, retails, groans and tears\r\n  about the streets of Norfolk!\r\n\r\nSee also the following correspondence between two traders, one in North\r\nCarolina, the other in New Orleans; with a word of comment, by Hon.\r\nWilliam Jay, of New York:\r\n\r\n                                      _Halifax, N. C., Nov. 16, 1839._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: I have shipped in the brig Addison,—prices are below:\r\n\r\n                    No. 1. Caroline Ennis,  $650.00\r\n                    No. 2. Silvy Holland,    625.00\r\n                    No. 3. Silvy Booth,      487.50\r\n                    No. 4. Maria Pollock,    475.00\r\n                    No. 5. Emeline Pollock,  475.00\r\n                    No. 6. Delia Averit,     475.00\r\n\r\n  The two girls that cost $650 and $625 were bought before I shipped\r\n  my first. I have a great many negroes offered to me, but I will not\r\n  pay the prices they ask, for I know they will come down. I have no\r\n  opposition in market. I will wait until I hear from you before I\r\n  buy, and then I can judge what I must pay. Goodwin will send you the\r\n  bill of lading for my negroes, as he shipped them with his own.\r\n  Write often, as the times are critical, and it depends on the prices\r\n  you get to govern me in buying. Yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n                                                         G. W. BARNES.\r\n\r\n     Mr. THEOPHILUS FREEMAN,      }\r\n           New Orleans.           }\r\n\r\n  The above was a small but choice invoice of wives and mothers. Nine\r\n  days before, namely, 7th Nov., Mr. Barnes advised Mr. Freeman of\r\n  having shipped a lot of forty-three men and women. Mr. Freeman,\r\n  informing one of his correspondents of the state of the market,\r\n  writes (_Sunday_, 21st Sept., 1839), “I bought a boy yesterday,\r\n  sixteen years old, and likely, _weighing_ one hundred and ten\r\n  pounds, at $700. I sold a likely girl, twelve years old, at $500. I\r\n  bought a man yesterday, twenty years old, six feet high, at $820;\r\n  one _to-day_, twenty-four years old, at $850, black and sleek as a\r\n  mole.”\r\n\r\nThe writer has drawn in this work only one class of the negro-traders.\r\nThere are all varieties of them, up to the great wholesale purchasers,\r\nwho keep their large trading-houses; who are gentlemanly in manners and\r\ncourteous in address; who, in many respects, often perform actions of\r\nreal generosity; who consider slavery a very great evil, and hope the\r\ncountry will at some time be delivered from it, but who think that so\r\nlong as clergyman and layman, saint and sinner, are all agreed in the\r\npropriety and necessity of slave-holding, it is better that the\r\nnecessary trade in the article be conducted by men of humanity and\r\ndecency, than by swearing, brutal men, of the Tom Loker school. These\r\nmen are exceedingly sensitive with regard to what they consider the\r\ninjustice of the world in excluding them from good society, simply\r\nbecause they undertake to supply a demand in the community which the\r\nbar, the press and the pulpit, all pronounce to be a proper one. In this\r\nrespect, society certainly imitates the unreasonableness of the ancient\r\nEgyptians, who employed a certain class of men to prepare dead bodies\r\nfor embalming, but flew at them with sticks and stones the moment the\r\noperation was over, on account of the sacrilegious liberty which they\r\nhad taken. If there is an ill-used class of men in the world, it is\r\ncertainly the slave-traders; for, if there is no harm in the institution\r\nof slavery,—if it is a divinely-appointed and honorable one, like civil\r\ngovernment and the family state, and like other species of property\r\nrelation,—then there is no earthly reason why a man may not as\r\ninnocently be a slave-trader as any other kind of trader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                          MR. AND MRS. SHELBY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the design of the writer, in delineating the domestic\r\narrangements of Mr. and Mrs. Shelby, to show a picture of the fairest\r\nside of slave-life, where easy indulgence and good-natured forbearance\r\nare tempered by just discipline and religious instruction, skilfully and\r\njudiciously imparted.\r\n\r\nThe writer did not come to her task without reading much upon both sides\r\nof the question, and making a particular effort to collect all the most\r\nfavorable representations of slavery which she could obtain. And, as the\r\nreader may have a curiosity to examine some of the documents, the writer\r\nwill present them quite at large. There is no kind of danger to the\r\nworld in letting the very fairest side of slavery be seen; in fact, the\r\nhorrors and barbarities which are necessarily inherent in it are so\r\nterrible that one stands absolutely in need of all the comfort which can\r\nbe gained from incidents like the subjoined, to save them from utter\r\ndespair of human nature. The first account is from Mr. J. K. Paulding’s\r\nLetters on Slavery; and is a letter from a Virginia planter, whom we\r\nshould judge, from his style, to be a very amiable, agreeable man, and\r\nwho probably describes very fairly the state of things on his own\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: As regards the first query, which relates to the “rights\r\n  and duties of the slave,” I do not know how extensive a view of this\r\n  branch of the subject is contemplated. In its simplest aspect, as\r\n  understood and acted on in Virginia, I should say that the slave is\r\n  entitled to an abundance of good plain food; to coarse but\r\n  comfortable apparel; to a warm but humble dwelling; to protection\r\n  when well, and to succor when sick; and, in return, that it is his\r\n  duty to render to his master all the service he can consistently\r\n  with perfect health, and to behave submissively and honestly. Other\r\n  remarks suggest themselves, but they will be more appropriately\r\n  introduced under different heads.\r\n\r\n  2d. “The domestic relations of master and slave.”—These relations\r\n  are much misunderstood by many persons at the North, who regard the\r\n  terms as synonymous with oppressor and oppressed. Nothing can be\r\n  further from the fact. The condition of the negroes in this state\r\n  has been greatly ameliorated. The proprietors were formerly fewer\r\n  and richer than at present. Distant quarters were often kept up to\r\n  support the aristocratic mansion. They were rarely visited by their\r\n  owners; and heartless overseers, frequently changed, were employed\r\n  to manage them for a share of the crop. These men scourged the land,\r\n  and sometimes the slaves. Their tenure was but for a year, and of\r\n  course they made the most of their brief authority. Owing to the\r\n  influence of our institutions, property has become subdivided, and\r\n  most persons live on or near their estates. There are exceptions, to\r\n  be sure, and particularly among wealthy gentlemen in the towns; but\r\n  these last are almost all enlightened and humane, and alike liberal\r\n  to the soil and to the slave who cultivates it. I could point out\r\n  some noble instances of patriotic and spirited improvement among\r\n  them. But, to return to the resident proprietors: most of them have\r\n  been raised on the estates; from the older negroes they have\r\n  received in infancy numberless acts of kindness; the younger ones\r\n  have not unfrequently been their playmates (not the most suitable, I\r\n  admit), and much good-will is thus generated on both sides. In\r\n  addition to this, most men feel attached to their property; and this\r\n  attachment is stronger in the case of persons than of things. I know\r\n  it, and feel it. It is true, there are harsh masters; but there are\r\n  also bad husbands and bad fathers. They are all exceptions to the\r\n  rule, not the rule itself. Shall we therefore condemn in the gross\r\n  those relations, and the rights and authority they imply, from their\r\n  occasional abuse? I could mention many instances of strong\r\n  attachment on the part of the slave, but will only adduce one or\r\n  two, of which I have been the object. It became a question whether a\r\n  faithful servant, bred up with me from boyhood, should give up his\r\n  master or his wife and children, to whom he was affectionately\r\n  attached, and most attentive and kind. The trial was a severe one,\r\n  but he determined to break those tender ties and remain with me. I\r\n  left it entirely to his discretion, though I would not, from\r\n  considerations of interest, have taken for him quadruple the price I\r\n  should probably have obtained. Fortunately, in the sequel, I was\r\n  enabled to purchase his family, with the exception of a daughter,\r\n  happily situated; and nothing but death shall henceforth part them.\r\n  Were it put to the test, I am convinced that many masters would\r\n  receive this striking proof of devotion. A gentleman but a day or\r\n  two since informed me of a similar, and even stronger case, afforded\r\n  by one of his slaves. As the reward of assiduous and delicate\r\n  attention to a venerated parent, in her last illness, I proposed to\r\n  purchase and liberate a healthy and intelligent woman, about thirty\r\n  years of age, the best nurse, and, in all respects, one of the best\r\n  servants in the state, of which I was only part owner; but she\r\n  declined to leave the family, and has been since rather better than\r\n  free. I shall be excused for stating a ludicrous case I heard of\r\n  some time ago:—A favorite and indulged servant requested his master\r\n  to sell him to another gentleman. His master refused to do so, but\r\n  told him he was at perfect liberty to go to the North, if he were\r\n  not already free enough. After a while he repeated the request; and,\r\n  on being urged to give an explanation of his singular conduct, told\r\n  his master that he considered himself consumptive, and would soon\r\n  die; and he thought Mr. B—— was better able to bear the loss than\r\n  his master. He was sent to a medicinal spring and recovered his\r\n  health, if, indeed, he had ever lost it, of which his master had\r\n  been unapprised. It may not be amiss to describe my deportment\r\n  towards my servants, whom I endeavor to render happy while I make\r\n  them profitable. I never turn a deaf ear, but listen patiently to\r\n  their communications. I chat familiarly with those who have passed\r\n  service, or have not begun to render it. With the others I observe a\r\n  more prudent reserve, but I encourage all to approach me without\r\n  awe. I hardly ever go to town without having commissions to execute\r\n  for some of them; and think they prefer to employ me, from a belief\r\n  that, if their money should not quite hold out, I would add a little\r\n  to it; and I not unfrequently do, in order to get a better article.\r\n  The relation between myself and my slaves is decidedly friendly. I\r\n  keep up pretty exact discipline, mingled with kindness, and hardly\r\n  ever lose property by thievish, or labor by runaway slaves. I never\r\n  lock the outer doors of my house. It is done, but done by the\r\n  servants; and I rarely bestow a thought on the matter. I leave home\r\n  periodically for two months, and commit the dwelling-house, plate,\r\n  and other valuables, to the servants, without even an enumeration of\r\n  the articles.\r\n\r\n  3d. “The duration of the labor of the slave.”—The day is usually\r\n  considered long enough. Employment at night is not exacted by me,\r\n  except to shell corn once a week for their own consumption, and on a\r\n  few other extraordinary occasions. _The people_, as we generally\r\n  call them, are required to leave their houses at daybreak, and to\r\n  work until dark, with the intermission of half an hour to an hour at\r\n  breakfast, and one to two hours at dinner, according to the season\r\n  and sort of work. In this respect I suppose our negroes will bear a\r\n  favorable comparison with any laborers whatever.\r\n\r\n  4th. “The liberty usually allowed the slave,—his holidays and\r\n  amusements, and the way in which they usually spend their evenings\r\n  and holidays.”—They are prohibited from going off the estate without\r\n  first obtaining leave; though they often transgress, and with\r\n  impunity, except in flagrant cases. Those who have wives on other\r\n  plantations visit them on certain specified nights, and have an\r\n  allowance of time for going and returning, proportioned to the\r\n  distance. My negroes are permitted, and, indeed, encouraged, to\r\n  raise as many ducks and chickens as they can; to cultivate\r\n  vegetables for their own use, and a patch of corn for sale; to\r\n  exercise their trades, when they possess one, which many do; to\r\n  catch muskrats and other animals for the fur or the flesh; to raise\r\n  bees, and, in fine, to earn an honest penny in any way which chance\r\n  or their own ingenuity may offer. The modes specified are, however,\r\n  those most commonly resorted to, and enable provident servants to\r\n  make from five to thirty dollars apiece. The corn is of a different\r\n  sort from that which I cultivate, and is all bought by me. A great\r\n  many fowls are raised; I have this year known ten dollars worth sold\r\n  by one man at one time. One of the chief sources of profit is the\r\n  fur of the muskrat; for the purpose of catching which the marshes on\r\n  the estate have been parcelled out and appropriated from time\r\n  immemorial, and are held by a tenure little short of fee-simple. The\r\n  negroes are indebted to Nat Turner[1] and Tappan for a curtailment\r\n  of some of their privileges. As a sincere friend to the blacks, I\r\n  have much regretted the reckless interference of these persons, on\r\n  account of the restrictions it has become, or been thought,\r\n  necessary to impose. Since the exploit of the former hero, they have\r\n  been forbidden to preach, except to their fellow-slaves, the\r\n  property of the same owner; to have public funerals, unless a white\r\n  person officiates; or to be taught to read and write. Their funerals\r\n  formerly gave them great satisfaction, and it was customary here to\r\n  furnish the relations of the deceased with bacon, spirit, flour,\r\n  sugar and butter, with which a grand entertainment, in their way,\r\n  was got up. We were once much amused by a hearty fellow requesting\r\n  his mistress to let him have his funeral during his lifetime, when\r\n  it would do him some good. The waggish request was granted; and I\r\n  venture to say there never was a funeral the subject of which\r\n  enjoyed it so much. When permitted, some of our negroes preached\r\n  with great fluency. I was present, a few years since, when an\r\n  Episcopal minister addressed the people, by appointment. On the\r\n  conclusion of an excellent sermon, a negro preacher rose and thanked\r\n  the gentleman kindly for his discourse, but frankly told him the\r\n  congregation “did not understand his _lingo_.” He then proceeded\r\n  himself, with great vehemence and volubility, coining words where\r\n  they had not been made to his hand, or rather his tongue, and\r\n  impressing his hearers, doubtless, with a decided opinion of his\r\n  superiority over his white co-laborer in the field of grace. My\r\n  brother and I, who own contiguous estates, have lately erected a\r\n  chapel on the line between them, and have employed an acceptable\r\n  minister of the Baptist persuasion, to which the negroes almost\r\n  exclusively belong, to afford them religious instruction. Except as\r\n  a preparatory step to emancipation, I consider it exceedingly\r\n  impolitic, even as regards the slaves themselves, to permit them to\r\n  read and write: “Where ignorance is bliss, ‘tis folly to be wise.”\r\n  And it is certainly impolitic as regards their masters, on the\r\n  principle that “knowledge is power.” My servants have not as long\r\n  holidays as those of most other persons. I allow three days at\r\n  Christmas, and a day at each of three other periods, besides a\r\n  little time to work their patches; or, if very busy, I sometimes\r\n  prefer to work them myself. Most of the ancient pastimes have been\r\n  lost in this neighborhood, and religion, mock or real, has succeeded\r\n  them. The banjo, their national instrument, is known but in name, or\r\n  in a few of the tunes which have survived. Some of the younger\r\n  negroes sing and dance, but the evenings and holidays are usually\r\n  occupied in working, in visiting, and in praying and singing hymns.\r\n  The primitive customs and sports are, I believe, better preserved\r\n  further south, where slaves were brought from Africa long after they\r\n  ceased to come here.\r\n\r\n  6th. “The provision usually made for their food and clothing,—for\r\n  those who are too young or too old to labor.”—My men receive twelve\r\n  quarts of Indian meal (the abundant and universal allowance in this\r\n  state), seven salted herrings, and two pounds of smoked bacon or\r\n  three pounds of pork, a week; the other hands proportionally less.\r\n  But, generally speaking, their food is issued daily, with the\r\n  exception of meal, and consists of fish or bacon for breakfast, and\r\n  meat, fresh or salted, with vegetables whenever we can provide them,\r\n  for dinner; or, for a month or two in the spring, fresh fish cooked\r\n  with a little bacon. This mode is rather more expensive to me than\r\n  that of weekly rations, but more comfortable to the servants.\r\n  Superannuated or invalid slaves draw their provisions regularly once\r\n  a week; and the moment a child ceases to be nourished by its mother,\r\n  it receives eight quarts of meal (more than it can consume), and one\r\n  half-pound of lard. Besides the food furnished by me, nearly all the\r\n  servants are able to make some addition from their private stores;\r\n  and there is among the adults hardly an instance of one so\r\n  improvident as not to do it. He must be an unthrifty fellow, indeed,\r\n  who cannot realize the wish of the famous Henry IV. in regard to the\r\n  French peasantry, and enjoy his fowl on Sunday. I always keep on\r\n  hand, for the use of the negroes, sugar, molasses, &c., which,\r\n  though not regularly issued, are applied for on the slightest\r\n  pretexts, and frequently no pretext at all, and are never refused,\r\n  except in cases of misconduct. In regard to clothing:—the men and\r\n  boys receive a winter coat and trousers of strong cloth, three\r\n  shirts, a stout pair of shoes and socks, and a pair of summer\r\n  pantaloons, every year; a hat about every second year, and a\r\n  great-coat and blanket every third year. Instead of great-coats and\r\n  hats, the women have large capes to protect the bust in bad weather,\r\n  and handkerchiefs for the head. The articles furnished are good and\r\n  serviceable; and, with their own acquisitions, make their appearance\r\n  decent and respectable. On Sunday they are even fine. The aged and\r\n  invalid are clad as regularly as the rest, but less substantially.\r\n  Mothers receive a little raw cotton, in proportion to the number of\r\n  children, with the privilege of having the yarn, when spun, woven at\r\n  my expense. I provide them with blankets. Orphans are put with\r\n  careful women, and treated with tenderness. I am attached to the\r\n  little slaves, and encourage familiarity among them. Sometimes, when\r\n  I ride near the quarters, they come running after me with the most\r\n  whimsical requests, and are rendered happy by the distribution of\r\n  some little donation. The clothing described is that which is given\r\n  to the crop hands. Home-servants, a numerous class in Virginia, are\r\n  of course clad in a different and very superior manner. I neglected\r\n  to mention, in the proper place, that there are on each of my\r\n  plantations a kitchen, an oven, and one or more cooks; and that each\r\n  hand is furnished with a tin bucket for his food, which is carried\r\n  into the field by little negroes, who also supply the laborers with\r\n  water.\r\n\r\n  7th. “Their treatment when sick.”—My negroes go, or are carried, as\r\n  soon as they are attacked, to a spacious and well-ventilated\r\n  hospital, near the mansion-house. They are there received by an\r\n  attentive nurse, who has an assortment of medicine, additional\r\n  bed-clothing, and the command of as much light food as she may\r\n  require, either from the table or the store-room of the proprietor.\r\n  Wine, sago, rice, and other little comforts appertaining to such an\r\n  establishment, are always kept on hand. The condition of the sick is\r\n  much better than that of the poor whites or free colored people in\r\n  the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n  8th. “Their rewards and punishments.”—I occasionally bestow little\r\n  gratuities for good conduct, and particularly after harvest; and\r\n  hardly ever refuse a favor asked by those who faithfully perform\r\n  their duty. Vicious and idle servants are punished with stripes,\r\n  moderately inflicted; to which, in the case of theft, is added\r\n  privation of meat, a severe punishment to those who are never\r\n  suffered to be without it on any other account. From my limited\r\n  observation, I think that servants to the North work much harder\r\n  than our slaves. I was educated at a college in one of the free\r\n  states, and, on my return to Virginia, was struck with the contrast.\r\n  I was astonished at the number of idle domestics, and actually\r\n  worried my mother, much to my contrition since, to reduce the\r\n  establishment. I say to my contrition, because, after eighteen\r\n  years’ residence in the good Old Dominion, I find myself surrounded\r\n  by a troop of servants about as numerous as that against which I\r\n  formerly so loudly exclaimed. While on this subject it may not be\r\n  amiss to state a case of manumission which occurred about three\r\n  years since. My nearest neighbor, a man of immense wealth, owned a\r\n  favorite servant, a fine fellow, with polished manners and excellent\r\n  disposition, who reads and writes, and is thoroughly versed in the\r\n  duties of a butler and housekeeper, in the performance of which he\r\n  was trusted without limit. This man was, on the death of his master,\r\n  emancipated with a legacy of six thousand dollars, besides about two\r\n  thousand dollars more which he had been permitted to accumulate, and\r\n  had deposited with his master, who had given him credit for it. The\r\n  use that this man, apparently so well qualified for freedom, and who\r\n  has had an opportunity of travelling and of judging for himself,\r\n  makes of his money and his time, is somewhat remarkable. In\r\n  consequence of his exemplary conduct, he has been permitted to\r\n  reside in the state, and for very moderate wages occupies the same\r\n  situation he did in the old establishment, and will probably\r\n  continue to occupy it as long as he lives. He has no children of his\r\n  own, but has put a little girl, a relation of his, to school. Except\r\n  in this instance, and in the purchase of a few plain articles of\r\n  furniture, his freedom and his money seem not much to have benefited\r\n  him. A servant of mine, who is intimate with him, thinks he is not\r\n  as happy as he was before his liberation. Several other servants\r\n  were freed at the same time, with smaller legacies, but I do not\r\n  know what has become of them.\r\n\r\n  I do not regard negro-slavery, however mitigated, as a Utopian\r\n  system, and have not intended so to delineate it. But it exists, and\r\n  the difficulty of removing it is felt and acknowledged by all, save\r\n  the fanatics, who, like “fools, rush in where angels dare not\r\n  tread.” It is pleasing to know that its burdens are not too heavy to\r\n  be borne. That the treatment of slaves in this state is humane, and\r\n  even indulgent, may be inferred from the fact of their rapid\r\n  increase and great longevity. I believe that, constituted as they\r\n  are, morally and physically, they are as happy as any peasantry in\r\n  the world; and I venture to affirm, as the result of my reading and\r\n  inquiry, that in no country are the laborers so liberally and\r\n  invariably supplied with bread and meat as are the negro slaves of\r\n  the United States. However great the dearth of provisions, famine\r\n  never reaches them.\r\n\r\n  P. S.—It might have been stated above that on this estate there are\r\n  about one hundred and sixty blacks. With the exception of infants,\r\n  there has been, in eighteen months, but one death that I\r\n  remember,—that of a man fully sixty-five years of age. The bill for\r\n  medical attendance, from the second day of last November, comprising\r\n  upwards of a year, is less than forty dollars.\r\n\r\nThe following accounts are taken from “Ingraham’s Travels in the\r\nSouth-west,” a work which seems to have been written as much to show the\r\nbeauties of slavery as anything else. Speaking of the state of things on\r\nsome Southern plantations, he gives the following pictures, which are\r\npresented without note or comment:\r\n\r\n  The little candidates for “field honors” are useless articles on a\r\n  plantation during the first five or six years of their existence.\r\n  They are then to take their first lesson in the elementary part of\r\n  their education. When they have learned their manual alphabet\r\n  tolerably well, they are placed in the field to take a spell at\r\n  cotton-picking. The first day in the field is their proudest day.\r\n  The young negroes look forward to it with as much restlessness and\r\n  impatience as school-boys to a vacation. Black children are not put\r\n  to work so young as many children of poor parents in the North. It\r\n  is often the case that the children of the domestic servants become\r\n  pets in the house, and the playmates of the white children of the\r\n  family. No scene can be livelier or more interesting to a\r\n  Northerner, than that which the negro quarters of a well-regulated\r\n  plantation present on a Sabbath morning, just before church-hours.\r\n  In every cabin the men are shaving and dressing; the women, arrayed\r\n  in their gay muslins, are arranging their frizzly hair,—in which\r\n  they take no little pride,—or investigating the condition of their\r\n  children; the old people, neatly clothed, are quietly conversing or\r\n  smoking about the doors; and those of the younger portion who are\r\n  not undergoing the infliction of the wash-tub are enjoying\r\n  themselves in the shade of the trees, or around some little pond,\r\n  with as much zest as though slavery and freedom were synonymous\r\n  terms. When all are dressed, and the hour arrives for worship, they\r\n  lock up their cabins, and the whole population of the little village\r\n  proceeds to the chapel, where divine service is performed, sometimes\r\n  by an officiating clergyman, and often by the planter himself, if a\r\n  church-member. The whole plantation is also frequently formed into a\r\n  Sabbath class, which is instructed by the planter, or some member of\r\n  his family; and often, such is the anxiety of the master that they\r\n  should perfectly understand what they are taught,—a hard matter in\r\n  the present state of their intellect,—that no means calculated to\r\n  advance their progress are left untried. I was not long since shown\r\n  a manuscript catechism, drawn up with great care and judgment by a\r\n  distinguished planter, on a plan admirably adapted to the\r\n  comprehension of the negroes.\r\n\r\n  It is now popular to treat slaves with kindness; and those planters\r\n  who are known to be inhumanly rigorous to their slaves are scarcely\r\n  countenanced by the more intelligent and humane portion of the\r\n  community. Such instances, however, are very rare; but there are\r\n  unprincipled men everywhere, who will give vent to their ill\r\n  feelings and bad passions, not with less good will upon the back of\r\n  an indented apprentice, than upon that of a purchased slave. Private\r\n  chapels are now introduced upon most of the plantations of the more\r\n  wealthy, which are far from any church; Sabbath-schools are\r\n  instituted for the black children, and Bible-classes for the\r\n  parents, which are superintended by the planter, a chaplain, or some\r\n  of the female members of the family.\r\n\r\n  Nor are planters indifferent to the comfort of their gray-headed\r\n  slaves. I have been much affected at beholding many exhibitions of\r\n  their kindly feeling towards them. They always address them in a\r\n  mild and pleasant manner, as “Uncle,” or “Aunty,”—titles as peculiar\r\n  to the old negro and negress as “boy” and “girl” to all under forty\r\n  years of age. Some old Africans are allowed to spend their last\r\n  years in their houses, without doing any kind of labor; these, if\r\n  not too infirm, cultivate little patches of ground, on which they\r\n  raise a few vegetables,—for vegetables grow nearly all the year\r\n  round in this climate,—and make a little money to purchase a few\r\n  extra comforts. They are also always receiving presents from their\r\n  masters and mistresses, and the negroes on the estate, the latter of\r\n  whom are extremely desirous of seeing the old people comfortable. A\r\n  relation of the extra comforts which some planters allow their\r\n  slaves would hardly obtain credit at the North. But you must\r\n  recollect that Southern planters are men, and men of feeling,\r\n  generous and high-minded, and possessing as much of the “milk of\r\n  human kindness” as the sons of colder climes—although they may have\r\n  been educated to regard that as right which a different education\r\n  has led Northerners to consider wrong.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the character of Mrs. Shelby the writer must say a few\r\nwords. While travelling in Kentucky, a few years since, some pious\r\nladies expressed to her the same sentiments with regard to slavery which\r\nthe reader has heard expressed by Mrs. Shelby.\r\n\r\nThere are many whose natural sense of justice cannot be made to tolerate\r\nthe enormities of the system, even though they hear it defended by\r\nclergymen from the pulpit, and see it countenanced by all that is most\r\nhonorable in rank and wealth.\r\n\r\nA pious lady said to the author, with regard to instructing her slaves,\r\n“I am ashamed to teach them what is right; I know that they know as well\r\nas I do that it is wrong to hold them as slaves, and I am ashamed to\r\nlook them in the face.” Pointing to an intelligent mulatto woman who\r\npassed through the room, she continued, “Now, there’s B——. She is as\r\nintelligent and capable as any white woman I ever knew, and as well able\r\nto have her liberty and take care of herself; and she knows it isn’t\r\nright to keep her as we do, and I know it too; and yet I cannot get my\r\nhusband to think as I do, or I should be glad to set them free.”\r\n\r\nA venerable friend of the writer, a lady born and educated a\r\nslave-holder, used to the writer the very words attributed to Mrs.\r\nShelby:—“I never thought it was right to hold slaves. I always thought\r\nit was wrong when I was a girl, and I thought so still more when I came\r\nto join the church.” An incident related by this friend of her\r\nexamination for the church shows in a striking manner what a difference\r\nmay often exist between theoretical and practical benevolence.\r\n\r\nA certain class of theologians in America have advocated the doctrine of\r\ndisinterested benevolence with such zeal as to make it an imperative\r\narticle of belief that every individual ought to be willing to endure\r\neverlasting misery, if by doing so they could, on the whole, produce a\r\ngreater amount of general good in the universe; and the inquiry was\r\nsometimes made of candidates for church-membership whether they could\r\nbring themselves to this point, as a test of their sincerity. The\r\nclergyman who was to examine this lady was particularly interested in\r\nthese speculations. When he came to inquire of her with regard to her\r\nviews as to the obligations of Christianity, she informed him decidedly\r\nthat she had brought her mind to the point of emancipating all her\r\nslaves, of whom she had a large number. The clergyman seemed rather to\r\nconsider this as an excess of zeal, and recommended that she should take\r\ntime to reflect upon it. He was, however, very urgent to know whether,\r\nif it should appear for the greatest good of the universe, she would be\r\nwilling to be damned. Entirely unaccustomed to theological speculations,\r\nthe good woman answered, with some vehemence, that “she was sure she was\r\nnot;” adding, naturally enough, that if that had been her purpose she\r\nneed not have come to join the church. The good lady, however, was\r\nadmitted, and proved her devotion to the general good by the more\r\ntangible method of setting all her slaves at liberty, and carefully\r\nwatching over their education and interests after they were liberated.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shelby is a fair type of the very best class of Southern women; and\r\nwhile the evils of the institution are felt and deplored, and while the\r\nworld looks with just indignation on the national support and patronage\r\nwhich is given to it, and on the men who, knowing its nature,\r\ndeliberately make efforts to perpetuate and extend it, it is but justice\r\nthat it should bear in mind the virtues of such persons.\r\n\r\nMany of them, surrounded by circumstances over which they can have no\r\ncontrol, perplexed by domestic cares of which women in free states can\r\nhave very little conception, loaded down by duties and responsibilities\r\nwhich wear upon the very springs of life, still go on bravely and\r\npatiently from day to day, doing all they can to alleviate what they\r\ncannot prevent, and, as far as the sphere of their own immediate power\r\nextends, rescuing those who are dependent upon them from the evils of\r\nthe system.\r\n\r\nWe read of Him who shall at last come to judgment, that “His fan is in\r\nhis hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat\r\ninto the garner.” Out of the great abyss of national sin he will rescue\r\nevery grain of good and honest purpose and intention. His eyes, which\r\nare as a flame of fire, penetrate at once those intricate mazes where\r\nhuman judgment is lost, and will save and honor at last the truly good\r\nand sincere, however they may have been involved with the evil; and such\r\nsouls as have resisted the greatest temptations, and persisted in good\r\nunder the most perplexing circumstances, are those of whom he has\r\nwritten, “And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in that day\r\nwhen I make up my jewels; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own\r\nson that serveth him.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  The leader of the insurrection in lower Virginia, in which upwards of\r\n  a hundred white persons, principally women and children, were\r\n  massacred in cold blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n                             GEORGE HARRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe character of George Harris has been represented as overdrawn, both\r\nas respects personal qualities and general intelligence. It has been\r\nsaid, too, that so many afflictive incidents happening to a slave are\r\nimprobable, and present a distorted view of the institution.\r\n\r\nIn regard to person, it must be remembered that the half-breeds often\r\ninherit, to a great degree, the traits of their white ancestors. For\r\nthis there is abundant evidence in the advertisements of the papers.\r\nWitness the following from the _Chattanooga_ (Tenn.) _Gazette_, Oct.\r\n5th, 1852:\r\n\r\n                              $500 REWARD.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  Runaway from the subscriber, on the 25th May, a VERY BRIGHT MULATTO\r\n  BOY, about 21 or 22 years old, named WASH. Said boy, without close\r\n  observation, might pass himself for a white man, as he is very\r\n  bright—has sandy hair, blue eyes, and a fine set of teeth. He is an\r\n  excellent bricklayer; but I have no idea that he will pursue his\r\n  trade, for fear of detection. Although he is like a white man in\r\n  appearance, he has the disposition of a negro, and delights in comic\r\n  songs and witty expressions. He is an excellent house servant, very\r\n  handy about a hotel,—tall, slender, and has rather a down look,\r\n  especially when spoken to, and is sometimes inclined to be sulky. I\r\n  have no doubt but he has been decoyed off by some scoundrel, and I\r\n  will give the above reward for the apprehension of the boy and\r\n  thief, if delivered at Chattanooga. Or, I will give $200 for the boy\r\n  alone; or $100 if confined in any jail in the United States, so that\r\n  I can get him.\r\n\r\n                                                    GEORGE O.

Soon after his escape from\r\nslavery, he was received into the family of a sister-in-law of the\r\nauthor, and there educated. His conduct during this time was such as to\r\nwin for him uncommon affection and respect, and the author has\r\nfrequently heard him spoken of in the highest terms by all who knew him.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman in whose family he so long resided says of him, in a\r\nrecent letter to the writer, “I would trust him, as the saying is, with\r\nuntold gold.”\r\n\r\nLewis is a quadroon, a fine-looking man, with European features, hair\r\nslightly wavy, and with an intelligent, agreeable expression of\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\nThe reader is now desired to compare the following incidents of his\r\nlife, part of which he related personally to the author, with the\r\nincidents of the life of George Harris.\r\n\r\nHis mother was a handsome quadroon woman, the daughter of her master,\r\nand given by him in marriage to a free white man, a Scotchman, with the\r\nexpress understanding that she and her children were to be free. This\r\nengagement, if made sincerely at all, was never complied with. His\r\nmother had nine children, and, on the death of her husband, came back,\r\nwith all these children, as slaves in her father’s house.\r\n\r\nA married daughter of the family, who was the dread of the whole\r\nhousehold, on account of the violence of her temper, had taken from the\r\nfamily, upon her marriage, a young girl. By the violence of her abuse\r\nshe soon reduced the child to a state of idiocy, and then came\r\nimperiously back to her father’s establishment, declaring that the child\r\nwas good for nothing, and that she would have another; and, as poor\r\nLewis’ evil star would have it, fixed her eye upon him.\r\n\r\nTo avoid one of her terrible outbreaks of temper, the family offered up\r\nthis boy as a pacificatory sacrifice. The incident is thus described by\r\nLewis, in a published narrative:\r\n\r\n  Every boy was ordered in, to pass before this female sorceress, that\r\n  she might select a victim for her unprovoked malice, and on whom to\r\n  pour the vials of her wrath for years. I was that unlucky fellow.\r\n  Mr. Campbell, my grandfather, objected, because it would divide a\r\n  family, and offered her Moses; * * * but objections and claims of\r\n  every kind were swept away by the wild passion and shrill-toned\r\n  voice of Mrs. B. Me she would have, and none else. Mr. Campbell went\r\n  out to hunt, and drive away bad thoughts; the old lady became quiet,\r\n  for she was sure none of her blood run in my veins, and, if there\r\n  was any of her husband’s there, it was no fault of hers.\r\n  Slave-holding women are always revengeful toward the children of\r\n  slaves that have any of the blood of their husbands in them. I was\r\n  too young—only seven years of age—to understand what was going on.\r\n  But my poor and affectionate mother understood and appreciated it\r\n  all. When she left the kitchen of the mansion-house, where she was\r\n  employed as cook, and came home to her own little cottage, the tear\r\n  of anguish was in her eye, and the image of sorrow upon every\r\n  feature of her face. She knew the female Nero whose rod was now to\r\n  be over me. That night sleep departed from her eyes. With the\r\n  youngest child clasped firmly to her bosom, she spent the night in\r\n  walking the floor, coming ever and anon to lift up the clothes and\r\n  look at me and my poor brother, who lay sleeping together.\r\n  _Sleeping_, I said. Brother slept, but not I. I saw my mother when\r\n  she first came to me, and I could not sleep. The vision of that\r\n  night—its deep, ineffaceable impression—is now before my mind with\r\n  all the distinctness of yesterday. In the morning I was put into the\r\n  carriage with Mrs. B. and her children, and my weary pilgrimage of\r\n  suffering was fairly begun.\r\n\r\nMrs. Banton is a character that can only exist where the laws of the\r\nland clothe with absolute power the coarsest, most brutal and\r\nviolent-tempered, equally with the most generous and humane.\r\n\r\nIf irresponsible power is a trial to the virtue of the most watchful and\r\ncareful, how fast must it develop cruelty in those who are naturally\r\nviolent and brutal!\r\n\r\nThis woman was united to a drunken husband, of a temper equally\r\nferocious. A recital of all the physical torture which this pair\r\ncontrived to inflict on a hapless child, some of which have left\r\nineffaceable marks on his person, would be too trying to humanity, and\r\nwe gladly draw a veil over it.\r\n\r\nSome incidents, however, are presented in the following extracts:\r\n\r\n  A very trivial offence was sufficient to call forth a great burst of\r\n  indignation from this woman of ungoverned passions. In my\r\n  simplicity, I put my lips to the same vessel, and drank out of it,\r\n  from which her children were accustomed to drink. She expressed her\r\n  utter abhorrence of such an act by throwing my head violently back,\r\n  and dashing into my face two dippers of water. The shower of water\r\n  was followed by a heavier shower of _kicks_; but the words, bitter\r\n  and cutting, that followed, were like a storm of hail upon my young\r\n  heart. “She would teach me better manners than that; she would let\r\n  me know I was to be brought up to her hand; she would have _one_\r\n  slave that knew his place; if I wanted water, go to the spring, and\r\n  not drink there in the house.” This was new times for me; for some\r\n  days I was completely benumbed with my sorrow.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  If there be one so lost to all feeling as even to say that the\r\n  slaves do not suffer when _families_ are separated, let such a one\r\n  go to the ragged quilt which was my couch and pillow, and stand\r\n  there night after night, for long, weary hours, and see the bitter\r\n  tears streaming down the face of that more than orphan boy, while\r\n  with half-suppressed sighs and sobs he calls again and again upon\r\n  his absent mother.\r\n\r\n            “Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?\r\n            Hovered thy spirit o’er thy sorrowing son?\r\n            Wretch even _then_! life’s journey just begun.”\r\n\r\nHe was employed till late at night in spinning flax or rocking the baby,\r\nand called at a very early hour in the morning; and if he did not start\r\nat the first summons, a cruel chastisement was sure to follow. He says:\r\n\r\n  Such horror has seized me, lest I might not hear the first shrill\r\n  call, that I have often in dreams fancied I heard that unwelcome\r\n  voice, and have leaped from my couch and walked through the house\r\n  and out of it before I awoke. I have gone and called the other\r\n  slaves, in my sleep, and asked them if they did not hear master\r\n  call. Never, while I live, will the remembrance of those long,\r\n  bitter nights of fear pass from my mind.\r\n\r\nHe adds to this words which should be deeply pondered by those who lay\r\nthe flattering unction to their souls that the oppressed do not feel the\r\nsundering of family ties.\r\n\r\n  But all my severe labor, and bitter and cruel punishments, for these\r\n  ten years of captivity with this worse than Arab family, all these\r\n  were as nothing to the sufferings I experienced by being separated\r\n  from my mother, brothers and sisters; the same things, with them\r\n  near to sympathize with me, to hear my story of sorrow, would have\r\n  been comparatively tolerable.\r\n\r\n  They were distant only about thirty miles; and yet, in ten long,\r\n  lonely years of childhood, I was only permitted to see them three\r\n  times.\r\n\r\n  My mother occasionally found an opportunity to send me some token of\r\n  remembrance and affection,—a sugar-plum or an apple; but I scarcely\r\n  ever ate them; they were laid up, and handled and wept over, till\r\n  they wasted away in my hand.\r\n\r\n  My thoughts continually by day, and my dreams by night, were of\r\n  mother and home; and the horror experienced in the morning, when I\r\n  awoke and behold it was a dream, is beyond the power of language to\r\n  describe.\r\n\r\nLewis had a beautiful sister by the name of Delia, who, on the death of\r\nher grandfather, was sold, with all the other children of his mother,\r\nfor the purpose of dividing the estate. She was a pious girl, a member\r\nof the Baptist church. She fell into the hands of a brutal, drunken man,\r\nwho wished to make her his mistress. Milton Clark, a brother of Lewis,\r\nin the narrative of his life describes the scene where he, with his\r\nmother, stood at the door while this girl was brutally whipped before it\r\nfor wishing to conform to the principles of her Christian profession. As\r\nher resolution was unconquerable, she was placed in a coffle and sent\r\ndown to the New Orleans market. Here she was sold to a Frenchman, named\r\nCoval. He took her to Mexico, emancipated and married her. After\r\nresiding some time in France and the West Indies with him, he died,\r\nleaving her a fortune of twenty or thirty thousand dollars. At her death\r\nshe endeavored to leave this by will to purchase the freedom of her\r\nbrothers; but, as a slave cannot take property, or even have it left in\r\ntrust for him, they never received any of it.\r\n\r\nThe incidents of the recovery of Lewis’ freedom are thus told:\r\n\r\n  I had long thought and dreamed of LIBERTY. I was now determined to\r\n  make an effort to gain it. No tongue can tell the doubt, the\r\n  perplexities, the anxiety, which a slave feels, when making up his\r\n  mind upon this subject. If he makes an effort, and is not\r\n  successful, he must be laughed at by his fellows, he will be beaten\r\n  unmercifully by the master, and then watched and used the harder for\r\n  it all his life.\r\n\r\n  And then, if he gets away, _who_, _what_ will he find? He is\r\n  ignorant of the world. All the white part of mankind, that he has\r\n  ever seen, are enemies to him and all his kindred. How can he\r\n  venture where none but white faces shall greet him? The master tells\r\n  him that abolitionists _decoy_ slaves off into the free states to\r\n  catch them and sell them to Louisiana or Mississippi; and, if he\r\n  goes to Canada, the British will put him in a _mine under ground,\r\n  with both eyes put out, for life_. How does he know what or whom to\r\n  believe? A horror of great darkness comes upon him, as he thinks\r\n  over what may befall him. Long, very long time did I think of\r\n  escaping, before I made the effort.\r\n\r\n  At length, the report was started that I was to be sold for\r\n  Louisiana. Then I thought it was time to act. My mind was made up.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  What my feelings were when I reached the free shore can be better\r\n  imagined than described. I trembled all over with deep emotion, and\r\n  I could feel my hair rise up on my head. I was on what was called a\r\n  _free_ soil, among a people who had no slaves. I saw white men at\r\n  work, and no slave smarting beneath the lash. Everything was indeed\r\n  _new_ and wonderful. Not knowing where to find a friend, and being\r\n  ignorant of the country, unwilling to inquire, lest I should betray\r\n  my ignorance, it was a whole week before I reached Cincinnati. At\r\n  one place where I put up, I had a great many more questions put to\r\n  me than I wished to answer. At another place, I was very much\r\n  annoyed by the officiousness of the landlord, who made it a point to\r\n  supply every guest with newspapers. I took the copy handed me, and\r\n  turned it over, in a somewhat awkward manner, I suppose. He came to\r\n  me to point out a veto, or some other very important news. I thought\r\n  it best to decline his assistance, and gave up the paper, saying my\r\n  eyes were not in a fit condition to read much.\r\n\r\n  At another place, the neighbors, on learning that a Kentuckian was\r\n  at the tavern, came, in great earnestness, to find out what my\r\n  business was. Kentuckians sometimes came there to kidnap their\r\n  citizens. They were in the habit of watching them close. I at length\r\n  satisfied them by assuring them that I was not, nor my father before\r\n  me, any slave-holder at all; but, lest their suspicions should be\r\n  excited in another direction, I added my grandfather was a\r\n  slave-holder.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  At daylight we were in Canada. When I stepped ashore here, I said,\r\n  sure enough, I AM FREE. Good heavens! what a sensation, when it\r\n  first visits the bosom of a full-grown man; one _born_ to bondage;\r\n  one who had been taught, from early infancy, that this was his\r\n  inevitable lot for life! Not till _then_ did I dare to cherish, for\r\n  a moment, the feeling that _one_ of the limbs of my body was my own.\r\n  The slaves often say, when cut in the hand or foot, “Plague on the\r\n  old foot” or “the old hand! It is master’s,—let him take care of it.\r\n  Nigger don’t care if he never get well.” My hands, my feet, were now\r\n  my own.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that George, in conversing with Eliza, gives an\r\naccount of a scene in which he was violently beaten by his master’s\r\nyoung son. This incident was suggested by the following letter from John\r\nM. Nelson to Mr. Theodore Weld, given in _Slavery as It Is_, p. 51.\r\n\r\nMr. Nelson removed from Virginia to Highland County, Ohio, many years\r\nsince, where he is extensively known and respected. The letter is dated\r\nJanuary 3d, 1839.\r\n\r\n  I was born and raised in Augusta County, Virginia; my father was an\r\n  elder in the Presbyterian church, and was “owner” of about twenty\r\n  slaves; he was what was generally termed a “good master.” His slaves\r\n  were generally tolerably well fed and clothed, and not over-worked;\r\n  they were sometimes permitted to attend church, and called in to\r\n  family worship; few of them, however, availed themselves of these\r\n  privileges. On _some occasions_ I have seen him whip them severely,\r\n  particularly for the crime of trying to obtain their liberty, or for\r\n  what was called “running away.” For _this_ they were scourged more\r\n  severely than for anything else. After they have been retaken I have\r\n  seen them stripped naked and suspended by the hands, sometimes to a\r\n  tree, sometimes to a post, until their toes barely touched the\r\n  ground, and whipped with a cowhide until the blood dripped from\r\n  their backs. A boy named Jack, particularly, I have seen served in\r\n  this way more than once. When I was quite a child, I recollect it\r\n  grieved me very much to see one _tied up_ to be whipped, and I used\r\n  to intercede with tears in their behalf, and mingle my cries with\r\n  theirs, and feel almost willing to take part of the punishment; I\r\n  have been severely rebuked by my father for this kind of sympathy.\r\n  Yet, such is the hardening nature of such scenes, that from this\r\n  kind of commiseration for the suffering slave I became so blunted\r\n  that I could not only witness their stripes with composure but\r\n  _myself_ inflict them, and that without remorse. One case I have\r\n  often looked back to with sorrow and contrition, particularly since\r\n  I have been convinced that “negroes are men.” When I was perhaps\r\n  fourteen or fifteen years of age, I undertook to correct a young\r\n  fellow named Ned, for some supposed offence,—I think it was leaving\r\n  a bridle out of its proper place; he, being larger and stronger than\r\n  myself, took hold of my arms and held me, in order to prevent my\r\n  striking him. This I considered the height of insolence, and cried\r\n  for help, when my father and mother both came running to my rescue.\r\n  My father stripped and tied him, and took him into the orchard,\r\n  where switches were plenty, and directed me to whip him; when one\r\n  switch wore out, he supplied me with others. After I had whipped him\r\n  a while, he fell on his knees to implore forgiveness, and I kicked\r\n  him in the face; my father said, “Don’t kick him, but whip him;”\r\n  this I did until his back was literally covered with _welts_. I know\r\n  I have repented, and trust I have obtained pardon for these things.\r\n\r\n  My father owned a woman (we used to call aunt Grace); she was\r\n  purchased in Old Virginia. She has told me that her old master, in\r\n  his _will_, gave her her freedom, but at his death his sons had sold\r\n  her to my father: when he bought her she manifested some\r\n  unwillingness to go with him, when she was put in irons and taken by\r\n  force. This was before I was born; but I remember to have seen the\r\n  irons, and was told that was what they had been used for. Aunt Grace\r\n  is still living, and must be between seventy and eighty years of\r\n  age; she has, for the last forty years, been an exemplary Christian.\r\n  When I was a youth I took some pains to learn her to read; this is\r\n  now a great consolation to her. Since age and infirmity have\r\n  rendered her of little value to her “owners,” she is permitted to\r\n  read as much as she pleases; this she can do, with the aid of\r\n  glasses, in the old family Bible, which is almost the only book she\r\n  has ever looked into. This, with some little mending for the black\r\n  children, is all she does; she is still held as a slave. I well\r\n  remember what _a heart-rending scene_ there was in the family when\r\n  _my father sold her husband_; this was, I suppose, thirty-five years\r\n  ago. And yet my father was considered one of the best of masters. I\r\n  know of few who were better, but of _many_ who were worse.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the intelligence of George, and his teaching himself to\r\nread and write, there is a most interesting and affecting parallel to it\r\nin the “Life of Frederick Douglass,”—a book which can be recommended to\r\nany one who has a curiosity to trace the workings of an intelligent and\r\nactive mind through all the squalid misery, degradation and oppression,\r\nof slavery. A few incidents will be given.\r\n\r\nLike Clark, Douglass was the son of a white man. He was a plantation\r\nslave in a proud old family. His situation, probably, may be considered\r\nas an average one; that is to say, he led a life of dirt, degradation,\r\ndiscomfort of various kinds, made tolerable as a matter of daily habit,\r\nand considered as enviable in comparison with the lot of those who\r\nsuffer worse abuse. An incident which Douglass relates of his mother is\r\ntouching. He states that it is customary at an early age to separate\r\nmothers from their children, for the purpose of blunting and deadening\r\nnatural affection. When he was three years old his mother was sent to\r\nwork on a plantation eight or ten miles distant, and after that he never\r\nsaw her except in the night. After her day’s toil she would occasionally\r\nwalk over to her child, lie down with him in her arms, hush him to sleep\r\nin her bosom, then rise up and walk back again to be ready for her field\r\nwork by daylight. Now, we ask the highest-born lady in England or\r\nAmerica, who is a mother, whether this does not show that this poor\r\nfield-laborer had in her bosom, beneath her dirt and rags, a true\r\nmother’s heart?\r\n\r\nThe last and bitterest indignity which has been heaped on the head of\r\nthe unhappy slaves has been the denial to them of those holy affections\r\nwhich God gives alike to all. We are told, in fine phrase, by languid\r\nladies of fashion, that “it is not to be supposed that those creatures\r\nhave the same feelings that we have,” when, perhaps, the very speaker\r\ncould not endure one tithe of the fatigue and suffering which the\r\nslave-mother often bears for her child. Every mother who has a mother’s\r\nheart within her, ought to know that this is blasphemy against nature,\r\nand, standing between the cradle of her living and the grave of her dead\r\nchild, should indignantly reject such a slander on all motherhood.\r\n\r\nDouglass thus relates the account of his learning to read, after he had\r\nbeen removed to the situation of house-servant in Baltimore.\r\n\r\nIt seems that his mistress, newly married and unaccustomed to the\r\nmanagement of slaves, was very kind to him, and, among other acts of\r\nkindness, commenced teaching him to read. His master, discovering what\r\nwas going on, he says,\r\n\r\n  At once forbade Mrs. Auld to instruct me further, telling her, among\r\n  other things, that it was unlawful, as well as unsafe, to teach a\r\n  slave to read. To use his own words, further, he said, “If you give\r\n  a nigger an inch, he will take an ell. A nigger should know nothing\r\n  but to obey his master—to do as he is told to do. Learning would\r\n  _spoil_ the best nigger in the world. Now,” said he, “if you teach\r\n  that nigger (speaking of myself) how to read, there would be no\r\n  keeping him. It would forever unfit him to be a slave. He would at\r\n  once become unmanageable, and of no value to his master. As to\r\n  himself, it could do him no good, but a great deal of harm. It would\r\n  make him discontented and unhappy.” There words sank deep into my\r\n  heart, stirred up sentiments within that lay slumbering, and called\r\n  into existence an entirely new train of thought. It was a new and\r\n  special revelation, explaining dark and mysterious things, with\r\n  which my youthful understanding had struggled, but struggled in\r\n  vain. I now understood what had been to me a most perplexing\r\n  difficulty—to wit, the white man’s power to enslave the black man.\r\n  It was a grand achievement, and I prized it highly. From that\r\n  moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to freedom.\r\n\r\nAfter this, his mistress was as watchful to prevent his learning to read\r\nas she had before been to instruct him. His course after this he thus\r\ndescribes:\r\n\r\n  From this time I was most narrowly watched. If I was in a separate\r\n  room any considerable length of time, I was sure to be suspected of\r\n  having a book, and was at once called to give an account of myself.\r\n  All this, however, was too late. The first step had been taken.\r\n  Mistress, in teaching me the alphabet, had given me the _inch_, and\r\n  no precaution could prevent me from taking the _ell_.\r\n\r\n  The plan which I adopted, and the one by which I was most\r\n  successful, was that of making friends of all the little white boys\r\n  whom I met in the street. As many of these as I could I converted\r\n  into teachers. With their kindly aid, obtained at different times\r\n  and in different places, I finally succeeded in learning to read.\r\n  When I was sent of errands I always took my book with me, and by\r\n  going one part of my errand quickly, I found time to get a lesson\r\n  before my return. I used also to carry bread with me, enough of\r\n  which was always in the house, and to which I was always welcome;\r\n  for I was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white\r\n  children in our neighborhood. This bread I used to bestow upon the\r\n  hungry little urchins, who, in return, would give me that more\r\n  valuable bread of knowledge. I am strongly tempted to give the names\r\n  of two or three of those little boys, as a testimonial of the\r\n  gratitude and affection I bear them; but prudence forbids;—not that\r\n  it would injure me, but it might embarrass them; for it is almost an\r\n  unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in this Christian\r\n  country. It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that they\r\n  lived on Philpot-street, very near Durgin and Bailey’s ship-yard. I\r\n  used to talk this matter of slavery over with them. I would\r\n  sometimes say to them I wished I could be as free as they would be\r\n  when they got to be men. “You will be free as soon as you are\r\n  twenty-one, _but I am a slave for life_! Have not I as good a right\r\n  to be free as you have?” These words used to trouble them; they\r\n  would express for me the liveliest sympathy, and console me with the\r\n  hope that something would occur by which I might be free.\r\n\r\n  I was now about twelve years old, and the thought of being _a slave\r\n  for life_ began to bear heavily upon my heart. Just about this time\r\n  I got hold of a book entitled “The Columbian Orator.” Every\r\n  opportunity I got I used to read this book. Among much of other\r\n  interesting matter, I found in it a dialogue between a master and\r\n  his slave. The slave was represented as having run away from his\r\n  master three times. The dialogue represented the conversation which\r\n  took place between them when the slave was retaken the third time.\r\n  In this dialogue, the whole argument in behalf of slavery was\r\n  brought forward by the master, all of which was disposed of by the\r\n  slave. The slave was made to say some very smart as well as\r\n  impressive things in reply to his master—things which had the\r\n  desired though unexpected effect; for the conversation resulted in\r\n  the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part of the master.\r\n\r\n  In the same book I met with one of Sheridan’s mighty speeches on and\r\n  in behalf of Catholic emancipation. These were choice documents to\r\n  me. I read them over and over again, with unabated interest. They\r\n  gave tongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul, which had\r\n  frequently flashed through my mind, and died away for want of\r\n  utterance. The moral which I gained from the dialogue was the power\r\n  of truth over the conscience of even a slave-holder. What I got from\r\n  Sheridan was a bold denunciation of slavery, and a powerful\r\n  vindication of human rights. The reading of these documents enabled\r\n  me to utter my thoughts, and to meet the arguments brought forward\r\n  to sustain slavery; but, while they relieved me of one difficulty,\r\n  they brought on another even more painful than the one of which I\r\n  was relieved. The more I read, the more I was led to abhor and\r\n  detest my enslavers. I could regard them in no other light than a\r\n  band of successful robbers, who had left their homes, and gone to\r\n  Africa, and stolen us from our homes, and in a strange land reduced\r\n  us to slavery. I loathed them as being the meanest as well as the\r\n  most wicked of men. As I read and contemplated the subject, behold!\r\n  that very discontentment which Master Hugh had predicted would\r\n  follow my learning to read had already come, to torment and sting my\r\n  soul to unutterable anguish. As I writhed under it, I would at times\r\n  feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than a blessing.\r\n  It had given me a view of my wretched condition without the remedy.\r\n  It opened my eyes to the horrible pit, but to no ladder upon which\r\n  to get out. In moments of agony I envied my fellow-slaves for their\r\n  stupidity. I have often wished myself a beast. I preferred the\r\n  condition of the meanest reptile to my own. Anything, no matter\r\n  what, to get rid of thinking! It was this everlasting thinking of my\r\n  condition that tormented me. There was no getting rid of it. It was\r\n  pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing, animate or\r\n  inanimate. The silver trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal\r\n  wakefulness. Freedom now appeared, to disappear no more forever. It\r\n  was heard in every sound, and seen in every thing. It was ever\r\n  present to torment me with a sense of my wretched condition. I saw\r\n  nothing without seeing it, I heard nothing without hearing it, and\r\n  felt nothing without feeling it. It looked from every star, it\r\n  smiled in every calm, breathed in every wind, and moved in every\r\n  storm.\r\n\r\n  I often found myself regretting my own existence, and wishing myself\r\n  dead; and but for the hope of being free, I have no doubt but that I\r\n  should have killed myself, or done something for which I should have\r\n  been killed. While in this state of mind I was eager to hear any one\r\n  speak of slavery. I was a ready listener. Every little while I could\r\n  hear something about the abolitionists. It was some time before I\r\n  found what the word meant. It was always used in such connections as\r\n  to make it an interesting word to me. If a slave ran away and\r\n  succeeded in getting clear, or if a slave killed his master, set\r\n  fire to a barn, or did anything very wrong in the mind of a\r\n  slave-holder, it was spoken of as the fruit of _abolition_. Hearing\r\n  the word in this connection very often, I set about learning what it\r\n  meant. The dictionary afforded me little or no help. I found it was\r\n  “the act of abolishing;” but then I did not know what was to be\r\n  abolished. Here I was perplexed. I did not dare to ask any one about\r\n  its meaning, for I was satisfied that it was something they wanted\r\n  me to know very little about. After a patient waiting, I got one of\r\n  our city papers, containing an account of the number of petitions\r\n  from the North praying for the abolition of slavery in the District\r\n  of Columbia, and of the slave-trade between the states. From this\r\n  time I understood the words _abolition_ and _abolitionist_, and\r\n  always drew near when that word was spoken, expecting to hear\r\n  something of importance to myself and fellow-slaves. The light broke\r\n  in upon me by degrees. I went one day down on the wharf of Mr.\r\n  Waters; and, seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow of stone, I went,\r\n  unasked, and helped them. When we had finished, one of them came to\r\n  me and asked me if I were a slave. I told him I was. He asked, “Are\r\n  ye a slave for life?” I told him that I was. The good Irishman\r\n  seemed to be deeply affected by the statement. He said to the other\r\n  that it was a pity so fine a little fellow as myself should be a\r\n  slave for life. He said it was a shame to hold me. They both advised\r\n  me to run away to the North; that I should find friends there, and\r\n  that I should be free. I pretended not to be interested in what they\r\n  said, and treated them as if I did not understand them; for I feared\r\n  they might be treacherous. White men have been known to encourage\r\n  slaves to escape, and then, to get the reward, catch them and return\r\n  them to their masters. I was afraid that these seemingly good men\r\n  might use me so; but I nevertheless remembered their advice, and\r\n  from that time I resolved to run away. I looked forward to a time at\r\n  which it would be safe for me to escape. I was too young to think of\r\n  doing so immediately; besides, I wished to learn how to write, as I\r\n  might have occasion to write my own pass. I consoled myself with the\r\n  hope that I should one day find a good chance. Meanwhile I would\r\n  learn to write.\r\n\r\n  The idea as to how I might learn to write was suggested to me by\r\n  being in Durgin and Bailey’s ship-yard, and frequently seeing the\r\n  ship carpenters, after hewing and getting a piece of timber ready\r\n  for use, write on the timber the name of that part of the ship for\r\n  which it was intended. When a piece of timber was intended for the\r\n  larboard side it would be marked thus—“L.” When a piece was for the\r\n  starboard side it would be marked thus—“S.” A piece for the larboard\r\n  side forward would be marked thus—“L. F.” When a piece was for\r\n  starboard side forward it would be marked thus—“S. F.” For larboard\r\n  aft it would be marked thus—“L. A.” For starboard aft it would be\r\n  marked thus—“S. A.” I soon learned the names of these letters, and\r\n  for what they were intended when placed upon a piece of timber in\r\n  the ship-yard. I immediately commenced copying them, and in a short\r\n  time was able to make the four letters named. After that, when I met\r\n  with any boy who I knew could write, I would tell him I could write\r\n  as well as he. The next word would be, “I don’t believe you. Let me\r\n  see you try it.” I would then make the letters which I had been so\r\n  fortunate as to learn, and ask him to beat that. In this way I got a\r\n  good many lessons in writing, which it is quite possible I should\r\n  never have gotten in any other way. During this time my copy-book\r\n  was the board fence, brick wall and pavement; my pen and ink was a\r\n  lump of chalk. With these I learned mainly how to write. I then\r\n  commenced and continued copying the Italics in Webster’s\r\n  Spelling-book, until I could make them all without looking on the\r\n  book. By this time my little Master Thomas had gone to school and\r\n  learned how to write, and had written over a number of copy-books.\r\n  These had been brought home, and shown to some of our near\r\n  neighbors, and then laid aside. My mistress used to go to\r\n  class-meeting at the Wilk-street meeting-house every Monday\r\n  afternoon, and leave me to take care of the house. When left thus I\r\n  used to spend the time in writing in the spaces left in Master\r\n  Thomas’ copy-book, copying what he had written. I continued to do\r\n  this until I could write a hand very similar to that of Master\r\n  Thomas. Thus, after a long, tedious effort for years, I finally\r\n  succeeded in learning how to write.\r\n\r\nThese few quoted incidents will show that the case of George Harris is\r\nby no means so uncommon as might be supposed.\r\n\r\nLet the reader peruse the account which George Harris gives of the sale\r\nof his mother and her children, and then read the following account\r\ngiven by the venerable Josiah Henson, now pastor of the missionary\r\nsettlement at Dawn, in Canada.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of his master, he says, the slaves of the plantation\r\nwere all put up at auction and sold to the highest bidder.\r\n\r\n  My brothers and sisters were bid off one by one, while my mother,\r\n  holding my hand, looked on in an agony of grief, the cause of which\r\n  I but ill understood at first, but which dawned on my mind with\r\n  dreadful clearness as the sale proceeded. My mother was then\r\n  separated from me, and put up in her turn. She was bought by a man\r\n  named Isaac R., residing in Montgomery County [Maryland], and then I\r\n  was offered to the assembled purchasers. My mother, half distracted\r\n  with the parting forever from all her children, pushed through the\r\n  crowd, while the bidding for me was going on, to the spot where R.\r\n  was standing. She fell at his feet, and clung to his knees,\r\n  entreating him, in tones that a mother only could command, to buy\r\n  her _baby_ as well as herself, and spare to her one of her little\r\n  ones at least. Will it, can it be believed, that this man, thus\r\n  appealed to, was capable not merely of turning a deaf ear to her\r\n  supplication, but of disengaging himself from her with such violent\r\n  blows and kicks as to reduce her to the necessity of creeping out of\r\n  his reach, and mingling the groan of bodily suffering with the sob\r\n  of a breaking heart?\r\n\r\nNow, all these incidents that have been given are _real_ incidents of\r\nslavery, related by those who know slavery by the best of all\r\ntests—experience; and they are given by men who have earned a character\r\nin freedom which makes their word as good as the word of any man living.\r\n\r\nThe case of Lewis Clark might be called a harder one than common. The\r\ncase of Douglass is probably a very fair average specimen.\r\n\r\nThe writer has conversed, in her time, with a very considerable number\r\nof liberated slaves, many of whom stated that their own individual lot\r\nhad been comparatively a mild one; but she never talked with one who did\r\nnot let fall, first or last, some incident which he had observed, some\r\nscene which he had witnessed, which went to show some most horrible\r\nabuse of the system; and, what was most affecting about it, the narrator\r\noften evidently considered it so much a matter of course as to mention\r\nit incidentally, without any particular emotion.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed by many that the great outcry among those who are opposed\r\nto slavery comes from a morbid reading of unauthenticated accounts\r\ngotten up in abolition papers, &c. This idea is a very mistaken one. The\r\naccounts which tell against the slave-system are derived from the\r\ncontinual living testimony of the poor slave himself; often from that of\r\nthe fugitives from slavery who are continually passing through our\r\nNorthern cities.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of some of the incidents thus developed, is given the\r\nfollowing fact of recent occurrence, related to the author by a lady in\r\nBoston. This lady, who was much in the habit of visiting the poor, was\r\nsent for, a month or two since, to see a mulatto woman who had just\r\narrived at a colored boarding-house near by, and who appeared to be in\r\nmuch dejection of mind. A little conversation showed her to be a\r\nfugitive. Her history was as follows: She, with her brother, were, as is\r\noften the case, both the children and slaves of their master. At his\r\ndeath they were left to his legitimate daughter as her servants, and\r\ntreated with as much consideration as very common kind of people might\r\nbe expected to show to those who were entirely and in every respect at\r\ntheir disposal.\r\n\r\nThe wife of her brother ran away to Canada; and as there was some talk\r\nof selling her and her child, in consequence of some embarrassment in\r\nthe family affairs, her brother, a fine-spirited young man, determined\r\nto effect her escape, also, to a land of liberty. He concealed her for\r\nsome time in the back part of an obscure dwelling in the city, till he\r\ncould find an opportunity to send her off. While she was in this\r\nretreat, he was indefatigable in his attentions to her, frequently\r\nbringing her fruit and flowers, and doing everything he could to beguile\r\nthe weariness of her imprisonment.\r\n\r\nAt length, the steward of a vessel, whom he had obliged, offered to\r\nconceal him on board the ship, and give him a chance to escape. The\r\nnoble-hearted fellow, though tempted by an offer which would enable him\r\nimmediately to join his wife, to whom he was tenderly attached,\r\npreferred to give this offer to his sister, and during the absence of\r\nthe captain of the vessel she and her child were brought on board and\r\nsecreted.\r\n\r\nThe captain, when he returned and discovered what had been done, was\r\nvery angry, as the thing, if detected, would have involved him in very\r\nserious difficulties. He declared, at first, that he would send the\r\nwoman up into town to jail; but, by her entreaties and those of the\r\nsteward, was induced to wait till evening, and send word to her brother\r\nto come and take her back. After dark the brother came on board, and,\r\ninstead of taking his sister away, began to appeal to the humanity of\r\nthe captain in the most moving terms. He told his sister’s history and\r\nhis own, and pleaded eloquently his desire for her liberty. The captain\r\nhad determined to be obdurate, but, alas! he was only a man. Perhaps he\r\nhad himself a wife and child,—perhaps he felt that, were he in the young\r\nman’s case, he would do just so for his sister. Be it as it may, he was\r\nat last overcome. He said to the young man, “I must send you away from\r\nmy ship; I’ll put off a boat and see you got into it, and you must row\r\noff, and never let me see your faces again; and if, after all, you\r\nshould come back and get on board, it will be your fault, and not mine.”\r\n\r\nSo, in the rain and darkness, the young man and his sister and child\r\nwere lowered over the side of the vessel, and rowed away. After a while\r\nthe ship weighed anchor, but before she reached Boston it was discovered\r\nthat the woman and child were on board.\r\n\r\nThe lady to whom this story was related was requested to write a letter,\r\nin certain terms, to a person in the city whence the fugitive had come,\r\nto let the brother know of her safe arrival.\r\n\r\nThe fugitive was furnished with work, by which she could support herself\r\nand child, and the lady carefully attended to her wants for a few weeks.\r\n\r\nOne morning she came in, with a good deal of agitation, exclaiming, “O,\r\nma’am, he’s come! George is come!” And in a few minutes the young man\r\nwas introduced.\r\n\r\nThe lady who gave this relation belongs to the first circles of Boston\r\nsociety; she says that she never was more impressed by the personal\r\nmanners of any gentleman than by those of this fugitive brother. So much\r\ndid he have the air of a perfect, finished gentleman, that she felt she\r\ncould not question him with regard to his escape with the familiarity\r\nwith which persons of his condition are commonly approached; and it was\r\nnot till he requested her to write a letter for him, because he could\r\nnot write himself, that she could realize that this fine specimen of\r\nmanhood had been all his life a slave.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the history is no less romantic. The lady had a friend\r\nin Montreal, whither George’s wife had gone; and, after furnishing money\r\nto pay their expenses, she presented them with a letter to this\r\ngentleman, requesting the latter to assist the young man in finding his\r\nwife. When they landed at Montreal, George stepped on shore and\r\npresented this letter to the first man he met, asking him if he knew to\r\nwhom it was directed. The gentleman proved to be the very person to whom\r\nthe letter was addressed. He knew George’s wife, brought him to her\r\nwithout delay, so that, by return mail, the lady had the satisfaction of\r\nlearning the happy termination of the adventure.\r\n\r\nThis is but a specimen of histories which are continually transpiring;\r\nso that those who speak of slavery can say, “We speak that which we do\r\nknow, and testify that we have seen.”\r\n\r\nBut we shall be told the slaves are all a lying race, and that these are\r\nlies which they tell us. There are some things, however, about these\r\nslaves, which cannot lie. Those deep lines of patient sorrow upon the\r\nface; that attitude of crouching and humble subjection; that sad,\r\nhabitual expression of hope deferred, in the eye,—would tell their\r\nstory, if the slave never spoke.\r\n\r\nIt is not long since the writer has seen faces such as might haunt one’s\r\ndreams for weeks.\r\n\r\nSuppose a poor, worn-out mother, sickly, feeble and old,—her hands worn\r\nto the bone with hard, unpaid toil,—whose nine children have been sold\r\nto the slave-trader, and whose tenth soon is to be sold, unless by her\r\nlabor as washerwoman she can raise nine hundred dollars! Such are the\r\nkind of cases constantly coming to one’s knowledge,—such are the\r\nwitnesses which will not let us sleep.\r\n\r\nDoubt has been expressed whether such a thing as an advertisement for a\r\nman, “_dead or alive_,” like the advertisement for George Harris, was\r\never published in the Southern States. The scene of the story in which\r\nthat occurs is supposed to be laid a few years back, at the time when\r\nthe black laws of Ohio were passed. That at this time such\r\nadvertisements were common in the newspapers, there is abundant\r\nevidence. That they are less common now, is a matter of hope and\r\ngratulation.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1839, Mr. Theodore D. Weld made a systematic attempt to\r\ncollect and arrange the statistics of slavery. A mass of facts and\r\nstatistics was gathered, which were authenticated with the most\r\nunquestionable accuracy. Some of the “one thousand witnesses,” whom he\r\nbrings upon the stand, were ministers, lawyers, merchants, and men of\r\nvarious other callings, who were either natives of the slave states, or\r\nhad been residents there for many years of their life. Many of these\r\nwere slave-holders. Others of the witnesses were, or had been,\r\nslave-drivers, or officers of coasting-vessels engaged in the\r\nslave-trade.\r\n\r\nAnother part of his evidence was gathered from public speeches in\r\nCongress, in the state legislatures, and elsewhere. But the majority of\r\nit was taken from recent newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe papers from which these facts were copied were preserved and put on\r\nfile in a public place, where they remained for some years, for the\r\ninformation of the curious. After Mr. Weld’s book was completed, a copy\r\nof it was sent, through the mail, to every editor from whose paper such\r\nadvertisements had been taken, and to every individual of whom any facts\r\nhad been narrated, with the passages which concerned them marked.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that this may have had some influence in rendering\r\nsuch advertisements less common. Men of sense often go on doing a thing\r\nwhich is very absurd, or even inhuman, simply because it has always been\r\ndone before them, and they follow general custom, without much\r\nreflection. When their attention, however, is called to it by a stranger\r\nwho sees the thing from another point of view, they become immediately\r\nsensible of the impropriety of the practice, and discontinue it. The\r\nreader will, however, be pained to notice, when he comes to the legal\r\npart of the book, that even in some of the largest cities of our slave\r\nstates this barbarity had not been entirely discontinued, in the year\r\n1850.\r\n\r\nThe list of advertisements in Mr. Weld’s book is here inserted, not to\r\nweary the reader with its painful details, but that, by running his eye\r\nover the dates of the papers quoted, and the places of their\r\npublication, he may form a fair estimate of the extent to which this\r\natrocity was _publicly_ practised:\r\n\r\n  The _Wilmington_ (North Carolina) _Advertiser_ of July 13, 1838,\r\n  contains the following advertisement:\r\n\r\n  “$100 will be paid to any person who may apprehend and safely\r\n  confine in any jail in this state a certain negro man, named ALFRED.\r\n  And the same reward will be paid, if satisfactory evidence is given\r\n  of _his having been_ KILLED. He has one or more scars on one of his\r\n  hands, caused by his having been shot.\r\n\r\n                                               THE CITIZENS OF ONSLOW.\r\n\r\n  “_Richlands, Onslow Co., May 16, 1838._”\r\n\r\nIn the same column with the above, and directly under it, is the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  “RANAWAY, my negro man RICHARD. A reward of $25 will be paid for his\r\n  apprehension, DEAD or ALIVE. Satisfactory proof will only be\r\n  required of his being KILLED. He has with him, in all probability,\r\n  his wife, ELIZA, who ran away from Col. Thompson, now a resident of\r\n  Alabama, about the time he commenced his journey to that state.\r\n\r\n                                                    DURANT H. RHODES.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Macon_ (Georgia) _Telegraph_, May 28, is the following:\r\n\r\n  “About the 1st of March last the negro man RANSOM left me without\r\n  the least provocation whatever; I will give a reward of twenty\r\n  dollars for said negro, if taken, DEAD OR ALIVE,—and if killed in\r\n  any attempt, an advance of five dollars will be paid.\r\n\r\n                                                       BRYANT JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n  “_Crawford Co., Georgia._”\r\n\r\nSee the _Newbern_ (N. C.) _Spectator_, Jan. 5, 1838, for the following:\r\n\r\n  “RANAWAY from the subscriber, a negro man named SAMPSON. Fifty\r\n  dollars reward will be given for the delivery of him to me, or his\r\n  confinement in any jail, so that I get him; and should he resist in\r\n  being taken, so that violence is necessary to arrest him, I will not\r\n  hold any person liable for damages should the slave be KILLED.\r\n\r\n                                                            ENOCH FOY.\r\n\r\n  “_Jones Co., N. C._”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Charleston_ (S. C.) _Courier_, Feb. 20, 1836:\r\n\r\n  “$300 REWARD.—Ranaway from the subscriber, in November last, his two\r\n  negro men named Billy and Pompey.\r\n\r\n  “Billy is 25 years old, and is known as the patroon of my boat for\r\n  many years; in all probability he may resist; in that event 50\r\n  dollars will be paid for his HEAD.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                                 ELIZA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer stated in her book that Eliza was a portrait drawn from life.\r\nThe incident which brought the original to her notice may be simply\r\nnarrated.\r\n\r\nWhile the writer was travelling in Kentucky, many years ago, she\r\nattended church in a small country town. While there, her attention was\r\ncalled to a beautiful quadroon girl, who sat in one of the slips of the\r\nchurch, and appeared to have charge of some young children. The\r\ndescription of Eliza may suffice for a description of her. When the\r\nauthor returned from church, she inquired about the girl, and was told\r\nthat she was as good and amiable as she was beautiful; that she was a\r\npious girl, and a member of the church; and, finally, that she was\r\n_owned_ by Mr. So-and-so. The idea that this girl was a slave struck a\r\nchill to her heart, and she said, earnestly, “O, I hope they treat her\r\nkindly.”\r\n\r\n“O, certainly,” was the reply; “they think as much of her as of their\r\nown children.”\r\n\r\n“I hope they will never sell her,” said a person in the company.\r\n\r\n“Certainly they will not; a Southern gentleman, not long ago, offered\r\nher master a thousand dollars for her: but he told him that she was too\r\ngood to be his wife, and he certainly should not have her for a\r\nmistress.”\r\n\r\nThis is all that the writer knows of that girl.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the incident of Eliza’s crossing the river on the ice,—as\r\nthe possibility of the thing has been disputed,—the writer gives the\r\nfollowing circumstance in confirmation.\r\n\r\nLast spring, while the author was in New York, a Presbyterian clergyman,\r\nof Ohio, came to her, and said, “I understand they dispute that fact\r\nabout the woman’s crossing the river. Now, I know all about that, for I\r\ngot the story from the very man that helped her up the bank. I know it\r\nis true, for she is now living in Canada.”\r\n\r\nIt has been objected that the representation of the scene in which the\r\nplan for kidnapping Eliza, concocted by Haley, Marks and Loker, at the\r\ntavern, is a gross caricature on the state of things in Ohio.\r\n\r\nWhat knowledge the author has had of the facilities which some justices\r\nof the peace, under the old fugitive law of Ohio, were in the habit of\r\ngiving to kidnapping, may be inferred by comparing the statement in her\r\nbook with some in her personal knowledge.\r\n\r\n  “Ye see,” said Marks to Haley, stirring his punch as he did so, “ye\r\n  see, we has justices convenient at all p’ints along shore, that does\r\n  up any little jobs in our line quite reasonable. Tom, he does the\r\n  knockin’ down, and that ar; and I come in all dressed up,—shining\r\n  boots,—everything first chop,—when the swearin’ ‘s to be done. You\r\n  oughter see me, now!” said Marks, in a glow of professional pride,\r\n  “how I can tone it off. One day I’m Mr. Twickem, from New Orleans;\r\n  ‘nother day, I’m just come from my plantation on Pearl river, where\r\n  I works seven hundred niggers; then, again, I come out a distant\r\n  relation to Henry Clay, or some old cock in Kentuck. Talents is\r\n  different, you know. Now, Tom’s a roarer when there’s any thumping\r\n  or fighting to be done; but at lying he an’t good, Tom an’t; ye see\r\n  it don’t come natural to him; but, Lord! if thar’s a feller in the\r\n  country that can swear to anything and everything, and put in all\r\n  the circumstances and flourishes with a longer face, and carry’t\r\n  through better’n I can, why, I’d like to see him, that’s all! I\r\n  b’lieve, my heart, I could get along, and make through, even if\r\n  justices were more particular than they is. Sometimes I rather wish\r\n  they was more particular; ‘twould be a heap more relishin’ if they\r\n  was,—more fun, yer know.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1839, the writer received into her family, as a servant, a\r\ngirl from Kentucky. She had been the slave of one of the lowest and most\r\nbrutal families, with whom she had been brought up, in a log-cabin, in a\r\nstate of half-barbarism. In proceeding to give her religious\r\ninstruction, the author heard, for the first time in her life, an\r\ninquiry which she had not supposed possible to be made in America:—“Who\r\nis Jesus Christ, now, anyhow?”\r\n\r\nWhen the author told her the history of the love and life and death of\r\nChrist, the girl seemed wholly overcome; tears streamed down her cheeks;\r\nand she exclaimed, piteously, “Why didn’t nobody never tell me this\r\nbefore?”\r\n\r\n“But,” said the writer to her, “haven’t you ever seen the Bible?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have seen missus a-readin’ on’t sometimes; but, law sakes! she’s\r\njust a-readin’ on’t ‘cause she could; don’t s’pose it did her no good,\r\nno way.”\r\n\r\nShe said she had been to one or two camp-meetings in her life, but\r\n“didn’t notice very particular.”\r\n\r\nAt all events, the story certainly made great impression on her, and had\r\nsuch an effect in improving her conduct, that the writer had great hopes\r\nof her.\r\n\r\nOn inquiring into her history, it was discovered that, by the laws of\r\nOhio, she was legally entitled to her freedom, from the fact of her\r\nhaving been brought into the state, and left there, temporarily, by the\r\nconsent of her mistress. These facts being properly authenticated before\r\nthe proper authorities, papers attesting her freedom were drawn up, and\r\nit was now supposed that all danger of pursuit was over. After she had\r\nremained in the family for some months, word was sent, from various\r\nsources, to Professor Stowe, that the girl’s young master was over,\r\nlooking for her, and that, if care were not taken, she would be conveyed\r\nback into slavery.\r\n\r\nProfessor Stowe called on the magistrate who had authenticated her\r\npapers, and inquired whether they were not sufficient to protect her.\r\nThe reply was, “Certainly they are, in law, if she could have a fair\r\nhearing; but they will come to your house in the night, with an officer\r\nand a warrant; they will take her before Justice D——, and swear to her.\r\nHe’s the man that does all this kind of business, and, he’ll deliver her\r\nup, and there’ll be an end to it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stowe then inquired what could be done; and was recommended to carry\r\nher to some place of security till the inquiry for her was over.\r\nAccordingly, that night, a brother of the author, with Professor Stowe,\r\nperformed for the fugitive that office which the senator is represented\r\nas performing for Eliza. They drove about ten miles on a solitary road,\r\ncrossed the creek at a very dangerous fording, and presented themselves,\r\nat midnight, at the house of John Van Zandt, a noble-minded Kentuckian,\r\nwho had performed the good deed which the author, in her story, ascribes\r\nto Van Tromp.\r\n\r\nAfter some rapping at the door, the worthy owner of the mansion\r\nappeared, candle in hand, as has been narrated.\r\n\r\n“Are you the man that would save a poor colored girl from kidnappers?”\r\nwas the first question.\r\n\r\n“Guess I am,” was the prompt response; “where is she?”\r\n\r\n“Why, she’s here.”\r\n\r\n“But how did you come?”\r\n\r\n“I crossed the creek.”\r\n\r\n“Why, the Lord helped you!” said he; “I shouldn’t dare cross it myself\r\nin the night. A man and his wife, and five children, were drowned there,\r\na little while ago.”\r\n\r\nThe reader may be interested to know that the poor girl never was\r\nretaken; that she married well in Cincinnati, is a very respectable\r\nwoman, and the mother of a large family of children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                               UNCLE TOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe character of Uncle Tom has been objected to as improbable; and yet\r\nthe writer has received more confirmations of that character, and from a\r\ngreater variety of sources, than of any other in the book.\r\n\r\nMany people have said to her, “I knew an Uncle Tom in such and such a\r\nSouthern State.” All the histories of this kind which have thus been\r\nrelated to her would of themselves, if collected, make a small volume.\r\nThe author will relate a few of them.\r\n\r\nWhile visiting in an obscure town in Maine, in the family of a friend,\r\nthe conversation happened to turn upon this subject, and the gentleman\r\nwith whose family she was staying related the following. He said that,\r\nwhen on a visit to his brother, in New Orleans, some years before, he\r\nfound in his possession a most valuable negro man, of such remarkable\r\nprobity and honesty that his brother literally trusted him with all he\r\nhad. He had frequently seen him take out a handful of bills, without\r\nlooking at them, and hand them to this servant, bidding him go and\r\nprovide what was necessary for the family, and bring him the change. He\r\nremonstrated with his brother on this imprudence; but the latter replied\r\nthat he had had such proof of this servant’s impregnable\r\nconscientiousness that he felt it safe to trust him to any extent.\r\n\r\nThe history of the servant was this. He had belonged to a man in\r\nBaltimore, who, having a general prejudice against all the religious\r\nexercises of slaves, did all that he could to prevent his having any\r\ntime for devotional duties, and strictly forbade him to read the Bible\r\nand pray, either by himself, or with the other servants; and because,\r\nlike a certain man of old, named Daniel, he constantly disobeyed this\r\nunchristian edict, his master inflicted upon him that punishment which a\r\nmaster always has in his power to inflict,—he sold him into perpetual\r\nexile from his wife and children, down to New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who gave the writer this information says that, although\r\nnot himself a religious man at the time, he was so struck with the man’s\r\npiety that he said to his brother, “I hope you will never do anything to\r\ndeprive this man of his religious privileges, for I think a judgment\r\nwill come upon you if you do.” To this his brother replied that he\r\nshould be very foolish to do it, since he had made up his mind that the\r\nman’s religion was the root of his extraordinary excellences.\r\n\r\nSome time since, there was sent to the writer from the South, through\r\nthe mail, a little book, entitled, “Sketches of Old Virginia Family\r\nServants,” with a preface by Bishop Meade. The book contains an account\r\nof the following servants: African Bella, Old Milly, Blind Lucy, Aunt\r\nBetty, Springfield Bob, Mammy Chris, Diana Washington, Aunt Margaret,\r\nRachel Parker, Nelly Jackson, My Own Mammy, Aunt Beck.\r\n\r\n  The following extract from Bishop Meade’s preface may not be\r\n  uninteresting.\r\n\r\n  The following sketches were placed in my hands with a request that I\r\n  would examine them with a view to publication.\r\n\r\n  After reading them I could not but think that they would be both\r\n  pleasing and edifying.\r\n\r\n  Very many such examples of fidelity and piety might be added from\r\n  the old Virginia families. These will suffice as specimens, and will\r\n  serve to show how interesting the relation between master and\r\n  servant often is.\r\n\r\n  Many will doubtless be surprised to find that there was so much\r\n  intelligence, as well as piety, in some of the old servants of\r\n  Virginia, and that they had learned to read the Sacred Scriptures,\r\n  so as to be useful in this way among their fellow-servants. It is,\r\n  and always has been true, in regard to the servants of the Southern\r\n  States, that although public schools may have been prohibited, yet\r\n  no interference has been attempted, where the owners have chosen to\r\n  teach their servants, or permit them to learn in a private way, how\r\n  to read God’s word. Accordingly, there always have been some who\r\n  were thus taught. In the more southern states the number of these\r\n  has most abounded. Of this fact I became well assured, about thirty\r\n  years since, when visiting the Atlantic states, with a view to the\r\n  formation of auxiliary colonization societies, and the selection of\r\n  the first colonists for Africa. In the city of Charleston, South\r\n  Carolina, I found more intelligence and character among the free\r\n  colored population than anywhere else. The same was true of some of\r\n  those in bondage. A respectable number might be seen in certain\r\n  parts of the Episcopal churches which I attended using their\r\n  prayer-books, and joining in the responses of the church.\r\n\r\n  Many purposes of convenience and hospitality were subserved by this\r\n  encouragement of cultivation in some of the servants, on the part of\r\n  the owners.\r\n\r\n  When travelling many years since with a sick wife, and two female\r\n  relatives, from Charleston to Virginia, at a period of the year when\r\n  many of the families from the country resort to the town for health,\r\n  we were kindly urged to call at the seat of one of the first\r\n  families in South Carolina, and a letter from the mistress, then in\r\n  the city, was given us, to her servant, who had charge of the house\r\n  in the absence of the family. On reaching there and delivering the\r\n  letter to a most respectable-looking female servant, who immediately\r\n  read it, we were kindly welcomed, and entertained, during a part of\r\n  two days, as sumptuously as though the owner had been present. We\r\n  understood that it was no uncommon thing in South Carolina for\r\n  travellers to be thus entertained by the servants in the absence of\r\n  the owners, on receiving letters from the same.\r\n\r\n  Instances of confidential and affectionate relationship between\r\n  servants and their masters and mistresses, such as are set forth in\r\n  the following Sketches, are still to be found in all the\r\n  slaveholding states. I mention one, which has come under my own\r\n  observation. The late Judge Upshur, of Virginia, had a faithful\r\n  house-servant (by his will now set free), with whom he used to\r\n  correspond on matters of business, when he was absent on his\r\n  circuit. I was dining at his house, some years since, with a number\r\n  of persons, himself being absent, when the conversation turned on\r\n  the subject of the presidential election, then going on through the\r\n  United States, and about which there was an intense interest; when\r\n  his servant informed us that he had that day received a letter from\r\n  his master, then on the western shore, in which he stated that the\r\n  friends of General Harrison might be relieved from all uneasiness,\r\n  as the returns already received made his election quite certain.\r\n\r\n  Of course it is not to be supposed that we design to convey the\r\n  impression that such instances are numerous, the nature of the\r\n  relationship forbidding it; but we do mean emphatically to affirm\r\n  that there is far more of kindly and Christian intercourse than many\r\n  at a distance are apt to believe. That there is a great and sad want\r\n  of Christian instruction, notwithstanding the more recent efforts\r\n  put forth to impart it, we most sorrowfully acknowledge.\r\n\r\nBishop Meade adds that these sketches are published with the hope that\r\nthey might have the effect of turning the attention of ministers and\r\nheads of families more seriously to the duty of caring for the souls of\r\ntheir servants.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the servant of Judge Upshur, spoken of in this\r\ncommunication of Bishop Meade, his master has left, in his last will,\r\nthe following remarkable tribute to his worth and excellence of\r\ncharacter:\r\n\r\n  I emancipate and set free my servant, David Rice, and direct my\r\n  executors to give him _one hundred dollars_. I recommend him in the\r\n  strongest manner to the respect, esteem and confidence, of any\r\n  community in which he may happen to live. He has been my slave for\r\n  twenty-four years, during all which time he has been trusted to\r\n  every extent, and in every respect; my confidence in him has been\r\n  unbounded; his relation to myself and family has always been such as\r\n  to afford him daily opportunities to deceive and injure us, yet he\r\n  has never been detected in any serious fault, nor even in an\r\n  unintentional breach of the decorum of his station. His intelligence\r\n  is of a high order, his integrity above all suspicion, and his sense\r\n  of right and propriety correct, and even refined. I feel that he is\r\n  justly entitled to carry this certificate from me in the new\r\n  relations which he must now form; it is due to his long and most\r\n  faithful services, and to the sincere and steady friendship which I\r\n  bear to him. In the uninterrupted confidential intercourse of\r\n  twenty-four years, I have never given him, nor had occasion to give\r\n  him, one unpleasant word. I know no man who has fewer faults or more\r\n  excellences than he.\r\n\r\nIn the free states there have been a few instances of such extraordinary\r\npiety among negroes, that their biography and sayings have been\r\ncollected in religious tracts, and published for the instruction of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nOne of these was, before his conversion, a convict in a state-prison in\r\nNew York, and there received what was, perhaps, the first religious\r\ninstruction that had ever been imparted to him. He became so eminent an\r\nexample of humility, faith, and, above all, fervent love, that his\r\npresence in the neighborhood was esteemed a blessing to the church. A\r\nlady has described to the writer the manner in which he would stand up\r\nand exhort in the church-meetings for prayer, when, with streaming eyes\r\nand the deepest abasement, humbly addressing them as his masters and\r\nmisses, he would nevertheless pour forth religious exhortations which\r\nwere edifying to the most cultivated and refined.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Brunswick, Maine, where the writer lived when writing\r\n“Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” may now be seen the grave of an aged colored woman,\r\nnamed Phebe, who was so eminent for her piety and loveliness of\r\ncharacter, that the writer has never heard her name mentioned except\r\nwith that degree of awe and respect which one would imagine due to a\r\nsaint. The small cottage where she resided is still visited and looked\r\nupon as a sort of shrine, as the spot where old Phebe lived and prayed.\r\nHer prayers and pious exhortations were supposed to have been the cause\r\nof the conversion of many young people in the place. Notwithstanding\r\nthat the unchristian feeling of caste prevails as strongly in Maine as\r\nanywhere else in New England, and the negro, commonly speaking, is an\r\nobject of aversion and contempt, yet, so great was the influence of her\r\npiety and loveliness of character, that she was uniformly treated with\r\nthe utmost respect and attention by all classes of people. The most\r\ncultivated and intelligent ladies of the place esteemed it a privilege\r\nto visit her cottage; and when she was old and helpless, her wants were\r\nmost tenderly provided for. When the news of her death was spread abroad\r\nin the place, it excited a general and very tender sensation of regret.\r\n“We have lost Phebe’s prayers,” was the remark frequently made\r\nafterwards by members of the church, as they met one another. At her\r\nfuneral the ex-governor of the state and the professors of the college\r\nofficiated as pall-bearers, and a sermon was preached in which the many\r\nexcellences of her Christian character were held up as an example to the\r\ncommunity. A small religious tract, containing an account of her life,\r\nwas published by the American Tract Society, prepared by a lady of\r\nBrunswick. The writer recollects that on reading the tract, when she\r\nfirst went to Brunswick, a doubt arose in her mind whether it was not\r\nsomewhat exaggerated. Some time afterwards she overheard some young\r\npersons conversing together about the tract, and saying that they did\r\nnot think it gave exactly the right idea of Phebe. “Why, is it too\r\nhighly colored?” was the inquiry of the author. “O, no, no, indeed,” was\r\nthe earnest response; “it doesn’t begin to give an idea of how good she\r\nwas.”\r\n\r\nSuch instances as these serve to illustrate the words of the apostle,\r\n“God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise;\r\nand God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things\r\nwhich are mighty.”\r\n\r\nJohn Bunyan says that although the valley of humiliation be unattractive\r\nin the eyes of the men of this world, yet the very sweetest flowers grow\r\nthere. So it is with the condition of the lowly and poor in this world.\r\nGod has often, indeed always, shown a particular regard for it, in\r\nselecting from that class the recipients of his grace. It is to be\r\nremembered that Jesus Christ, when he came to found the Christian\r\ndispensation, did not choose his apostles from the chief priests and the\r\nscribes, learned in the law, and high in the church; nor did he choose\r\nthem from philosophers and poets, whose educated and comprehensive minds\r\nmight be supposed best able to appreciate his great designs; but he\r\nchose twelve plain, poor fishermen, who were ignorant, and felt that\r\nthey were ignorant, and who, therefore, were willing to give themselves\r\nup with all simplicity to his guidance. What God asks of the soul more\r\nthan anything else is faith and simplicity, the affection and reliance\r\nof the little child. Even these twelve fancied too much that they were\r\nwise, and Jesus was obliged to set a little child in the midst of them,\r\nas a more perfect teacher.\r\n\r\nThe negro race is confessedly more simple, docile, childlike and\r\naffectionate, than other races; and hence the divine graces of love and\r\nfaith, when in-breathed by the Holy Spirit, find in their natural\r\ntemperament a more congenial atmosphere.\r\n\r\nA last instance parallel with that of Uncle Tom is to be found in the\r\npublished memoirs of the venerable Josiah Henson, now, as we have said,\r\na clergyman in Canada. He was “raised” in the State of Maryland. His\r\nfirst recollections were of seeing his father mutilated and covered with\r\nblood, suffering the penalty of the law for the crime of raising his\r\nhand against a white man,—that white man being the overseer, who had\r\nattempted a brutal assault upon his mother. This punishment made his\r\nfather surly and dangerous, and he was subsequently sold south, and thus\r\nparted forever from his wife and children. Henson grew up in a state of\r\nheathenism, without any religious instruction, till, in a camp-meeting,\r\nhe first heard of Jesus Christ, and was electrified by the great and\r\nthrilling news that He had tasted death for every man, the bond as well\r\nas the free. This story produced an immediate conversion, such as we\r\nread of in the Acts of the Apostles, where the Ethiopian eunuch, from\r\none interview, hearing the story of the cross, at once believes and is\r\nbaptized. Henson forthwith not only became a Christian, but began to\r\ndeclare the news to those about him; and, being a man of great natural\r\nforce of mind and strength of character, his earnest endeavors to\r\nenlighten his fellow-heathen were so successful that he was gradually\r\nled to assume the station of a negro preacher; and though he could not\r\nread a word of the Bible or hymn-book, his labors in this line were much\r\nprospered. He became immediately a very valuable slave to his master,\r\nand was intrusted by the latter with the oversight of his whole estate,\r\nwhich he managed with great judgment and prudence. His master appears to\r\nhave been a very ordinary man in every respect,—to have been entirely\r\nincapable of estimating him in any other light then as exceedingly\r\nvaluable property, and to have had no other feeling excited by his\r\nextraordinary faithfulness than the desire to make the most of him. When\r\nhis affairs became embarrassed, he formed the design of removing all his\r\nnegroes into Kentucky, and intrusted the operation entirely to his\r\noverseer. Henson was to take them alone, without any other attendant,\r\nfrom Maryland to Kentucky, a distance of some thousands of miles, giving\r\nonly his promise as a Christian that he would faithfully perform this\r\nundertaking. On the way thither they passed through a portion of Ohio,\r\nand there Henson was informed that he could now secure his own freedom\r\nand that of all his fellows, and he was strongly urged to do it. He was\r\nexceedingly tempted and tried, but his Christian principle was\r\ninvulnerable. No inducements could lead him to feel that it was right\r\nfor a Christian to violate a pledge solemnly given, and his influence\r\nover the whole band was so great that he took them all with him into\r\nKentucky. Those casuists among us who lately seem to think and teach\r\nthat it is right for us to violate the plain commands of God whenever\r\nsome great national good can be secured by it, would do well to\r\ncontemplate the inflexible principle of this poor slave, who, without\r\nbeing able to read a letter of the Bible, was yet enabled to perform\r\nthis most sublime act of self-renunciation in obedience its commands.\r\nSubsequently to this his master, in a relenting moment, was induced by a\r\nfriend to sell him his freedom for four hundred dollars; but, when the\r\nexcitement of the importunity had passed off, he regretted that he had\r\nsuffered so valuable a piece of property to leave his hands for so\r\nslight a remuneration. By an unworthy artifice, therefore, he got\r\npossession of his servant’s free papers, and condemned him still to\r\nhopeless slavery. Subsequently, his affairs becoming still more\r\ninvolved, he sent his son down the river with a flat-boat loaded with\r\ncattle and produce for the New Orleans market, directing him to take\r\nHenson along, and sell him after they had sold the cattle and the boat.\r\nAll the depths of the negro’s soul were torn up and thrown into\r\nconvulsion by this horrible piece of ingratitude, cruelty and injustice;\r\nand, while outwardly calm, he was struggling with most bitter\r\ntemptations from within, which, as he could not read the Bible, he could\r\nrepel only by a recollection of its sacred truths, and by earnest\r\nprayer. As he neared the New Orleans market, he says that these\r\nconvulsions of soul increased, especially when he met some of his old\r\ncompanions from Kentucky, whose despairing countenances and emaciated\r\nforms told of hard work and insufficient food, and confirmed all his\r\nworst fears of the lower country. In the transports of his despair, the\r\ntemptation was more urgently presented to him to murder his young master\r\nand the other hand on the flat-boat in their sleep, to seize upon the\r\nboat, and make his escape. He thus relates the scene where he was almost\r\nbrought to the perpetration of this deed:\r\n\r\n  One dark, rainy night, within a few days of New Orleans, my hour\r\n  seemed to have come. I was alone on the deck; Mr. Amos and the hands\r\n  were all asleep below, and I crept down noiselessly, got hold of an\r\n  axe, entered the cabin, and looking by the aid of the dim light\r\n  there for my victims, my eye fell upon Master Amos, who was nearest\r\n  to me; my hand slid along the axe-handle, I raised it to strike the\r\n  fatal blow,—when suddenly the thought came to me, “What! commit\r\n  _murder_! and you a Christian?” I had not called it murder before.\r\n  It was self-defence,—it was preventing others from murdering me,—it\r\n  was justifiable, it was even praiseworthy. But now, all at once, the\r\n  truth burst upon me that it was a crime. I was going to kill a young\r\n  man, who had done nothing to injure me, but obey commands which he\r\n  could not resist; I was about to lose the fruit of all my efforts at\r\n  self-improvement, the character I had acquired, and the peace of\r\n  mind which had never deserted me. All this came upon me instantly,\r\n  and with a distinctness which made me almost think I heard it\r\n  whispered in my ear; and I believe I even turned my head to listen.\r\n  I shrunk back, laid down the axe, crept up on deck again, and\r\n  thanked God, as I have done every day since, that I had not\r\n  committed murder.\r\n\r\n  My feelings were still agitated, but they were changed. I was filled\r\n  with shame and remorse for the design I had entertained, and with\r\n  the fear that my companions would detect it in my face, or that a\r\n  careless word would betray my guilty thoughts. I remained on deck\r\n  all night, instead of rousing one of the men to relieve me; and\r\n  nothing brought composure to my mind, but the solemn resolution I\r\n  then made to resign myself to the will of God, and take with\r\n  thankfulness, if I could, but with submission, at all events,\r\n  whatever he might decide should be my lot. I reflected that if my\r\n  life were reduced to a brief term I should have less to suffer, and\r\n  that it was better to die with a Christian’s hope, and a quiet\r\n  conscience, than to live with the incessant recollection of a crime\r\n  that would destroy the value of life, and under the weight of a\r\n  secret that would crush out the satisfaction that might be expected\r\n  from freedom, and every other blessing.\r\n\r\nSubsequently to this, his young master was taken violently down with the\r\nriver fever, and became as helpless as a child. He passionately\r\nentreated Henson not to desert him, but to attend to the selling of the\r\nboat and produce, and put him on board the steamboat, and not to leave\r\nhim, dead or alive, till he had carried him back to his father.\r\n\r\nThe young master was borne in the arms of his faithful servant to the\r\nsteamboat, and there nursed by him with unremitting attention during the\r\njourney up the river; nor did he leave him till he had placed him in his\r\nfather’s arms.\r\n\r\nOur love for human nature would lead us to add, with sorrow, that all\r\nthis disinterestedness and kindness was rewarded only by empty praises,\r\nsuch as would be bestowed upon a very fine dog; and Henson indignantly\r\nresolved no longer to submit to the injustice. With a degree of\r\nprudence, courage and address, which can scarcely find a parallel in any\r\nhistory, he managed, with his wife and two children, to escape into\r\nCanada. Here he learned to read, and, by his superior talent and\r\ncapacity for management, laid the foundation for the fugitive settlement\r\nof Dawn, which is understood to be one of the most flourishing in\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nIt would be well for the most cultivated of us to ask, whether our ten\r\ntalents in the way of religious knowledge have enabled us to bring forth\r\nas much fruit to the glory of God, to withstand temptation as patiently,\r\nto return good for evil as disinterestedly, as this poor, ignorant\r\nslave. A writer in England has sneeringly remarked that such a man as\r\nUncle Tom might be imported as a missionary to teach the most cultivated\r\nin England or America the true nature of religion. These instances show\r\nthat what has been said with a sneer is in truth a sober verity; and it\r\nshould never be forgotten that out of this race whom man despiseth have\r\noften been chosen of God true messengers of his grace, and temples for\r\nthe indwelling of his Spirit.\r\n\r\n“_For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose\r\nname is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is\r\nof a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and\r\nto revive the heart of the contrite ones._”\r\n\r\nThe vision attributed to Uncle Tom introduces quite a curious chapter of\r\npsychology with regard to the negro race, and indicates a peculiarity\r\nwhich goes far to show how very different they are from the white race.\r\nThey are possessed of a nervous organization peculiarly susceptible and\r\nimpressible. Their sensations and impressions are very vivid, and their\r\nfancy and imagination lively. In this respect the race has an oriental\r\ncharacter, and betrays its tropical origin. Like the Hebrews of old and\r\nthe oriental nations of the present, they give vent to their emotions\r\nwith the utmost vivacity of expression, and their whole bodily system\r\nsympathizes with the movements of their minds. When in distress, they\r\nactually lift up their voices to weep, and “cry with an exceeding bitter\r\ncry.” When alarmed, they are often paralyzed, and rendered entirely\r\nhelpless. Their religious exercises are all colored by this sensitive\r\nand exceedingly vivacious temperament. Like oriental nations, they\r\nincline much to outward expressions, violent gesticulations, and\r\nagitating movements of the body. Sometimes, in their religious meetings,\r\nthey will spring from the floor many times in succession, with a\r\nviolence and rapidity which is perfectly astonishing. They will laugh,\r\nweep, embrace each other convulsively, and sometimes become entirely\r\nparalyzed and cataleptic. A clergyman from the North once remonstrated\r\nwith a Southern clergyman for permitting such extravagances among his\r\nflock. The reply of the Southern minister was, in effect, this: “Sir, I\r\nam satisfied that the races are so essentially different that they\r\ncannot be regulated by the same rules. I, at first, felt as you do; and,\r\nthough I saw that genuine conversions did take place, with all this\r\noutward manifestation, I was still so much annoyed by it as to forbid it\r\namong my negroes, till I was satisfied that the repression of it was a\r\nserious hindrance to real religious feeling; and then I became certain\r\nthat all men cannot be regulated in their religious exercises by one\r\nmodel. I am assured that conversions produced with these accessories are\r\nquite as apt to be genuine, and to be as influential over the heart and\r\nlife, as those produced in any other way.” The fact is, that the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race—cool, logical and practical—have yet to learn the\r\ndoctrine of toleration for the peculiarities of other races; and perhaps\r\nit was with a foresight of their peculiar character, and dominant\r\nposition in the earth, that God gave the Bible to them in the fervent\r\nlanguage and with the glowing imagery of the more susceptible and\r\npassionate oriental races.\r\n\r\nMesmerists have found that the negroes are singularly susceptible to all\r\nthat class of influences which produce catalepsy, mesmeric sleep, and\r\npartial clairvoyant phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe African race, in their own climate, are believers in spells, in\r\n“fetish and obi,” in “the evil eye,” and other singular influences, for\r\nwhich, probably, there is an origin in this peculiarity of constitution.\r\nThe magicians in scriptural history were Africans; and the so-called\r\nmagical arts are still practised in Egypt, and other parts of Africa,\r\nwith a degree of skill and success which can only be accounted for by\r\nsupposing peculiarities of nervous constitution quite different from\r\nthose of the whites. Considering those distinctive traits of the race,\r\nit is no matter of surprise to find in their religious histories, when\r\nacted upon by the powerful stimulant of the Christian religion, very\r\npeculiar features. We are not surprised to find almost constantly, in\r\nthe narrations of their religious histories, accounts of visions, of\r\nheavenly voices, of mysterious sympathies and transmissions of knowledge\r\nfrom heart to heart without the intervention of the senses, or what the\r\nQuakers call being “baptized into the spirit” of those who are distant.\r\n\r\nCases of this kind are constantly recurring in their histories. The\r\nyoung man whose story was related to the Boston lady, and introduced\r\nabove in the chapter on George Harris, stated this incident concerning\r\nthe recovery of his liberty: That, after the departure of his wife and\r\nsister, he, for a long time, and very earnestly, sought some opportunity\r\nof escape, but that every avenue appeared to be closed to him. At\r\nlength, in despair, he retreated to his room, and threw himself upon his\r\nbed, resolving to give up the undertaking, when, just as he was sinking\r\nto sleep, he was roused by a voice saying in his ear, “Why do you sleep\r\nnow? Rise up, if you ever mean to be free!” He sprang up, went\r\nimmediately out, and, in the course of two hours, discovered the means\r\nof escape which he used.\r\n\r\nA lady whose history is known to the writer resided for some time on a\r\nSouthern plantation, and was in the habit of imparting religious\r\ninstruction to the slaves. One day, a woman from a distant plantation\r\ncalled at her residence, and inquired for her. The lady asked, in\r\nsurprise, “How did you know about me?” The old woman’s reply was, that\r\nshe had long been distressed about her soul; but that, several nights\r\nbefore, some one had appeared to her in a dream, told her to go to this\r\nplantation and inquire for the strange lady there, and that she would\r\nteach her the way to heaven.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen of the same kind was related to the writer by a\r\nslave-woman who had been through the whole painful experience of a\r\nslave’s life. She was originally a young girl of pleasing exterior and\r\ngentle nature, carefully reared as a seamstress and nurse to the\r\nchildren of a family in Virginia, and attached, with all the warmth of\r\nher susceptible nature, to these children. Although one of the tenderest\r\nof mothers when the writer knew her, yet she assured the writer that she\r\nhad never loved a child of her own as she loved the dear little young\r\nmistress who was her particular charge. Owing, probably, to some\r\npecuniary difficulty in the family, this girl, whom we will call Louisa,\r\nwas sold, to go on to a Southern plantation. She has often described the\r\nscene when she was forced into a carriage, and saw her dear young\r\nmistress leaning from the window, stretching her arms towards her,\r\nscreaming, and calling her name, with all the vehemence of childish\r\ngrief. She was carried in a coffle, and sold as cook on a Southern\r\nplantation. With the utmost earnestness of language she has described to\r\nthe writer her utter loneliness, and the distress and despair of her\r\nheart, in this situation, parted forever from all she held dear on\r\nearth, without even the possibility of writing letters or sending\r\nmessages, surrounded by those who felt no kind of interest in her, and\r\nforced to a toil for which her more delicate education had entirely\r\nunfitted her. Under these circumstances, she began to believe that it\r\nwas for some dreadful sin she had thus been afflicted. The course of her\r\nmind after this may be best told in her own simple words:\r\n\r\n“After that, I began to feel awful wicked,—O, so wicked, you’ve no idea!\r\nI felt so wicked that my sins seemed like a load on me, and I went so\r\nheavy all the day! I felt so wicked that I didn’t feel worthy to pray in\r\nthe house, and I used to go way off in the lot and pray. At last, one\r\nday, when I was praying, the Lord he came and spoke to me.”\r\n\r\n“The Lord spoke to you?” said the writer; “what do you mean, Louisa?”\r\n\r\nWith a face of the utmost earnestness, she answered, “Why, ma’am, the\r\nLord Jesus he came and spoke to me, you know; and I never, till the last\r\nday of my life, shall forget what he said to me.”\r\n\r\n“What was it?” said the writer.\r\n\r\n“He said, ‘Fear not, my little one; thy sins are forgiven thee;’” and\r\nshe added to this some verses, which the writer recognized as those of a\r\nMethodist hymn.\r\n\r\nBeing curious to examine more closely this phenomenon, the author said,\r\n\r\n“You mean that you dreamed this, Louisa.”\r\n\r\nWith an air of wounded feeling, and much earnestness, she answered,\r\n\r\n“O no, Mrs. Stowe; that never was a dream; you’ll never make me believe\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nThe thought at once arose in the writer’s mind, If the Lord Jesus is\r\nindeed everywhere present, and if he is as tender-hearted and\r\ncompassionate as he was on earth,—and we know he is,—must he not\r\nsometimes long to speak to the poor, desolate slave, when he knows that\r\nno voice but His can carry comfort and healing to his soul?\r\n\r\nThis instance of Louisa is so exactly parallel to another case, which\r\nthe author received from an authentic source, that she is tempted to\r\nplace the two side by side.\r\n\r\nAmong the slaves who were brought into the New England States, at the\r\ntime when slavery was prevalent, was one woman, who, immediately on\r\nbeing told the history of the love of Jesus Christ, exclaimed, “He is\r\nthe one; this is what I wanted.”\r\n\r\nThis language causing surprise, her history was inquired into. It was\r\nbriefly this: While living in her simple hut in Africa, the kidnappers\r\none day rushed upon her family, and carried her husband and children off\r\nto the slave-ship, she escaping into the woods. On returning to her\r\ndesolate home, she mourned with the bitterness of “Rachel weeping for\r\nher children.” For many days her heart was oppressed with a heavy weight\r\nof sorrow; and, refusing all sustenance, she wandered up and down the\r\ndesolate forest.\r\n\r\nAt last, she says, a strong impulse came over her to kneel down and pour\r\nout her sorrows into the ear of some unknown Being whom she fancied to\r\nbe above her, in the sky.\r\n\r\nShe did so; and, to her surprise, found an inexpressible sensation of\r\nrelief. After this, it was her custom daily to go out to this same spot,\r\nand supplicate this unknown Friend. Subsequently, she was herself taken,\r\nand brought over to America; and, when the story of Jesus and his love\r\nwas related to her, she immediately felt in her soul that this Jesus was\r\nthe very friend who had spoken comfort to her yearning spirit in the\r\ndistant forest of Africa.\r\n\r\nCompare now these experiences with the earnest and beautiful language of\r\nPaul: “He hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all\r\nthe face of the earth; and hath determined the times before appointed\r\n_and the bounds_ of their habitation, _that_ THEY SHOULD _seek the Lord,\r\nif haply they might_ FEEL AFTER HIM AND FIND HIM, _though he be not far\r\nfrom every one of us_.”\r\n\r\nIs not this truly “_feeling after God and finding Him_”? And may we not\r\nhope that the yearning, troubled, helpless heart of man, pressed by the\r\ninsufferable anguish of this short life, or wearied by its utter vanity,\r\nnever extends its ignorant, pleading hand to God in vain? Is not the\r\nveil which divides us from an almighty and most merciful Father much\r\nthinner than we, in the pride of our philosophy, are apt to imagine? and\r\nis it not the most worthy conception of Him to suppose that the more\r\nutterly helpless and ignorant the human being is that seeks His aid, the\r\nmore tender and the more condescending will be His communication with\r\nthat soul?\r\n\r\nIf a mother has among her children one whom sickness has made blind, or\r\ndeaf, or dumb, incapable of acquiring knowledge through the usual\r\nchannels of communication, does she not seek to reach its darkened mind\r\nby modes of communication tenderer and more intimate than those which\r\nshe uses with the stronger and more favored ones? But can the love of\r\nany mother be compared with the infinite love of Jesus? Has He not\r\ndescribed himself as that good Shepherd who leaves the whole flock of\r\nsecure and well-instructed ones, to follow over the mountains of sin and\r\nignorance the one lost sheep; and, when He hath found it, rejoicing more\r\nover that one than over the ninety and nine that went not astray? Has He\r\nnot told us that each of these little ones has a guardian angel that\r\ndoth always behold the face of his Father which is in heaven? And is it\r\nnot comforting to us to think that His love and care will be in\r\nproportion to the ignorance and the wants of His chosen ones?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince the above was prepared for the press the author has received the\r\nfollowing extract from a letter written by a gentleman in Missouri to\r\nthe editor of the _Oberlin_ (Ohio) _Evangelist_:\r\n\r\n  I really thought, while reading “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” that the\r\n  authoress, when describing the character of Tom, had in her mind’s\r\n  eye a slave whose acquaintance I made some years since, in the State\r\n  of Mississippi, called “Uncle Jacob.” I was staying a day or two\r\n  with a planter, and in the evening, when out in the yard, I heard a\r\n  well-known hymn and tune sung in one of the “quarters,” and then the\r\n  voice of prayer; and O, _such_ a prayer! what fervor, what\r\n  unction,—nay, the man “prayed right up;” and when I read of Uncle\r\n  Tom, how “nothing could exceed the touching simplicity, the\r\n  childlike earnestness, of his prayer, enriched with the language of\r\n  Scripture, which seemed so entirely to have wrought itself into his\r\n  being as to have become a part of himself,” the recollections of\r\n  that evening prayer were strangely vivid. On entering the house and\r\n  referring to what I had heard, his master replied, “Ah, sir, if I\r\n  covet anything in this world, it is Uncle Jacob’s religion. If there\r\n  is a good man on earth, he certainly is one.” He said Uncle Jacob\r\n  was a regulator on the plantation; that a _word_ or a _look_ from\r\n  him, addressed to younger slaves, had more efficacy than a _blow_\r\n  from the overseer.\r\n\r\n  The next morning Uncle Jacob informed me he was from Kentucky,\r\n  opposite Cincinnati; that his opportunities for attending religious\r\n  worship had been frequent; that at about the age of forty he was\r\n  sold south, was set to picking cotton; could not, when doing his\r\n  best, pick the task assigned him; was whipped and whipped, he could\r\n  not possibly tell how often; was of the opinion that the overseer\r\n  came to the conclusion that whipping could not bring one more pound\r\n  out of him, for he set him to driving a team. At this and other work\r\n  he could “make a _hand_;” had changed owners three or four times. He\r\n  expressed himself as well pleased with his present situation as he\r\n  expected to be in the South, but was yearning to return to his\r\n  former associations in Kentucky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                             MISS OPHELIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia stands as the representative of a numerous class of the\r\nvery best of Northern people; to whom, perhaps, if our Lord should again\r\naddress his churches a letter, as he did those of old time, he would use\r\nthe same words as then: “I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy\r\npatience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil; and thou hast\r\ntried them which are apostles and are not, and hast found them liars;\r\nand hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast labored\r\nand hast not fainted. Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee,\r\nbecause thou hast left thy first love.”\r\n\r\nThere are in this class of people activity, zeal, unflinching\r\nconscientiousness, clear intellectual discriminations between truth and\r\nerror, and great logical and doctrinal correctness; but there is a want\r\nof that spirit of love, without which, in the eye of Christ, the most\r\nperfect character is as deficient as a wax flower—wanting in life and\r\nperfume.\r\n\r\nYet this blessed principle is not dead in their hearts, but only\r\nsleepeth; and so great is the real and genuine goodness, that, when the\r\ntrue magnet of divine love is applied, they always answer to its touch.\r\n\r\nSo when the gentle Eva, who is an impersonation in childish form of the\r\nlove of Christ, solves at once, by a blessed instinct, the problem which\r\nOphelia has long been unable to solve by dint of utmost hammering and\r\nvehement effort, she at once, with a good and honest heart, perceives\r\nand acknowledges her mistake, and is willing to learn even of a little\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nMiss Ophelia, again, represents one great sin, of which, unconsciously,\r\nAmerican Christians have allowed themselves to be guilty. Unconsciously\r\nit must be, for nowhere is conscience so predominant as among this\r\nclass, and nowhere is there a more honest strife to bring every thought\r\ninto captivity to the obedience of Christ.\r\n\r\nOne of the first and most declared objects of the gospel has been to\r\nbreak down all those irrational barriers and prejudices which separate\r\nthe human brotherhood into diverse and contending clans. Paul says, “In\r\nChrist Jesus there is neither Jew nor Greek, barbarian, Scythian, bond\r\nnor free.” The Jews at that time were separated from the Gentiles by an\r\ninsuperable wall of prejudice. They could not eat and drink together,\r\nnor pray together. But the apostles most earnestly labored to show them\r\nthe sin of this prejudice. St. Paul says to the Ephesians, speaking of\r\nthis former division, “He is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath\r\nbroken down the middle wall of partition between us.”\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to see that although slavery has been abolished in the\r\nNew England States, it has left behind it the most baneful feature of\r\nthe system—that which makes American worse than Roman slavery—the\r\nprejudice of caste and color. In the New England States the negro has\r\nbeen treated as belonging to an inferior race of beings;—forced to sit\r\napart by himself in the place of worship; his children excluded from the\r\nschools; himself excluded from the railroad-car and the omnibus, and the\r\npeculiarities of his race made the subject of bitter contempt and\r\nridicule.\r\n\r\nThis course of conduct has been justified by saying that they are a\r\ndegraded race. But how came they degraded? Take any class of men, and\r\nshut them from the means of education, deprive them of hope and\r\nself-respect, close to them all avenues of honorable ambition, and you\r\nwill make just such a race of them as the negroes have been among us.\r\n\r\nSo singular and so melancholy is the dominion of prejudice over the\r\nhuman mind, that professors of Christianity in our New England States\r\nhave often, with very serious self-denial to themselves, sent the gospel\r\nto heathen as dark-complexioned as the Africans, when in their very\r\nneighborhood were persons of dark complexion, who, on that account, were\r\nforbidden to send their children to the schools, and discouraged from\r\nentering the churches. The effect of this has been directly to degrade\r\nand depress the race, and then this very degradation and depression has\r\nbeen pleaded as the reason for continuing this course.\r\n\r\nNot long since the writer called upon a benevolent lady, and during the\r\ncourse of the call the conversation turned upon the incidents of a fire\r\nwhich had occurred the night before in the neighborhood. A deserted\r\nhouse had been burned to the ground. The lady said it was supposed it\r\nhad been set on fire. “What could be any one’s motive for setting it on\r\nfire?” said the writer.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the lady, “it was supposed that a colored family was\r\nabout to move into it, and it was thought that the neighborhood wouldn’t\r\nconsent to that. So it was supposed that was the reason.”\r\n\r\nThis was said with an air of innocence and much unconcern.\r\n\r\nThe writer inquired, “Was it a family of bad character?”\r\n\r\n“No, not particularly, that I know of,” said the lady; “but then they\r\nare negroes, you know.”\r\n\r\nNow, this lady is a very pious lady. She probably would deny herself to\r\nsend the gospel to the heathen, and if she had ever thought of\r\nconsidering this family a heathen family, would have felt the deepest\r\ninterest in their welfare; because on the subject of duty to the heathen\r\nshe had been frequently instructed from the pulpit, and had all her\r\nreligious and conscientious sensibilities awake. Probably she had never\r\nlistened from the pulpit to a sermon which should exhibit the great\r\ntruth, that “in Christ Jesus there is neither Jew nor Greek, barbarian,\r\nScythian, bond nor free.”\r\n\r\nSupposing our Lord was now on earth, as he was once, what course is it\r\nprobable that he would pursue with regard to this unchristian prejudice\r\nof color?\r\n\r\nThere was a class of men in those days as much despised by the Jews as\r\nthe negroes are by us; and it was a complaint made of Christ that he was\r\na friend of publicans and sinners. And if Christ should enter, on some\r\ncommunion season, into a place of worship, and see the colored man\r\nsitting afar off by himself, would it not be just in his spirit to go\r\nthere and sit with him, rather than to take the seats of his richer and\r\nmore prosperous brethren?\r\n\r\nIt is, however, but just to our Northern Christians to say that this sin\r\nhas been committed ignorantly and in unbelief, and that within a few\r\nyears signs of a much better spirit have begun to manifest themselves.\r\nIn some places, recently, the doors of school-houses have been thrown\r\nopen to the children, and many a good Miss Ophelia has opened her eyes\r\nin astonishment to find that, while she has been devouring the\r\n_Missionary Herald_, and going without butter on her bread and sugar in\r\nher tea to send the gospel to the Sandwich Islands, there is a very\r\nthriving colony of heathen in her own neighborhood at home; and, true to\r\nher own good and honest heart, she has resolved, _not_ to give up her\r\nprayers and efforts for the heathen abroad, but to add thereunto labors\r\nfor the heathen at home.\r\n\r\nOur safety and hope in this matter is this: that there are multitudes in\r\nall our churches who do most truly and sincerely love Christ above all\r\nthings, and who, just so soon as a little reflection shall have made\r\nthem sensible of their duty in this respect, will most earnestly perform\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, if they do so, they may be called Abolitionists; but\r\nthe true Miss Ophelia is not afraid of a hard name in a good cause, and\r\nhas rather learned to consider “the reproach of Christ a greater\r\ntreasure than the riches of Egypt.”\r\n\r\nThat there is much already for Christians to do in enlightening the\r\nmoral sense of the community on this subject, will appear if we consider\r\nthat even so well-educated and gentlemanly a man as Frederick Douglass\r\nwas recently obliged to pass the night on the deck of a steamer, when in\r\ndelicate health, because this senseless prejudice deprived him of a\r\nplace in the cabin; and that that very laborious and useful minister,\r\nDr. Pennington, of New York, has, during the last season, been often\r\nobliged seriously to endanger his health, by walking to his pastoral\r\nlabors, over his very extended parish, under a burning sun, because he\r\ncould not be allowed the common privilege of the omnibus, which conveys\r\nevery class of white men, from the most refined to the lowest and most\r\ndisgusting.\r\n\r\nLet us consider now the number of professors of the religion of Christ\r\nin New York, and consider also that, by the very fact of their\r\nprofession, they consider Dr. Pennington the brother of their Lord, and\r\na member with them of the body of Christ.\r\n\r\nNow, these Christians are influential, rich and powerful; they can\r\ncontrol public sentiment on any subject that they think of any\r\nparticular importance, and they profess, by their religion, that “if one\r\nmember suffers, all the members suffer with it.”\r\n\r\nIt is a serious question, whether such a marked indignity offered to\r\nChrist and his ministry, in the person of a colored brother, without any\r\nremonstrance on their part, will not lead to a general feeling that all\r\nthat the Bible says about the union of Christians is a mere hollow\r\nsound, and means nothing.\r\n\r\nThose who are anxious to do something directly to improve the condition\r\nof the slave, can do it in no way so directly as by elevating the\r\ncondition of the free colored people around them, and taking every pains\r\nto give them equal rights and privileges.\r\n\r\nThis unchristian prejudice has doubtless stood in the way of the\r\nemancipation of hundreds of slaves. The slave-holder, feeling and\r\nacknowledging the evils of slavery, has come to the North, and seen\r\nevidences of this unkindly and unchristian state of feeling towards the\r\nslave, and has thus reflected within himself:\r\n\r\n“If I keep my slave at the South, he is, it is true, under the dominion\r\nof a very severe law; but then he enjoys the advantage of my friendship\r\nand assistance, and derives, through his connection with me and my\r\nfamily, some kind of a position in the community. As my servant he is\r\nallowed a seat in the car and a place at the table. But if I emancipate\r\nand send him North, he will encounter substantially all the\r\ndisadvantages of slavery, with no master to protect him.”\r\n\r\nThis mode of reasoning has proved an apology to many a man for keeping\r\nhis slaves in a position which he confesses to be a bad one; and it will\r\nbe at once perceived that, should the position of the negro be\r\nconspicuously reversed in our northern states, the effect upon the\r\nemancipation of the slave would be very great. They, then, who keep up\r\nthis prejudice, may be said to be, in a certain sense, slave-holders.\r\n\r\nIt is not meant by this that all distinctions of society should be\r\nbroken over, and that people should be obliged to choose their intimate\r\nassociates from a class unfitted by education and habits to sympathize\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nThe negro should not be lifted out of his sphere of life because he is a\r\nnegro, but he should be treated with Christian courtesy _in_ his sphere.\r\nIn the railroad car, in the omnibus and steamboat, all ranks and degrees\r\nof white persons move with unquestioned freedom side by side; and\r\nChristianity requires that the negro have the same privilege.\r\n\r\nThat the dirtiest and most uneducated foreigner or American, with breath\r\nredolent of whiskey and clothes foul and disordered, should have an\r\nunquestioned right to take a seat next to any person in a railroad car\r\nor steamboat, and that the respectable, decent and gentlemanly negro\r\nshould be excluded simply because he is a negro, cannot be considered\r\notherwise than as an irrational and unchristian thing: and any Christian\r\nwho allows such things done in his presence without remonstrance, and\r\nthe use of his Christian influence, will certainly be made deeply\r\nsensible of his error when he comes at last to direct and personal\r\ninterview with his Lord.\r\n\r\nThere is no hope for this matter, if the love of Christ is not strong\r\nenough, and if it cannot be said, with regard to the two races, “He is\r\nour peace who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall\r\nof partition between us.”\r\n\r\nThe time is coming rapidly when the upper classes in society must learn\r\nthat their education, wealth and refinement, are not their own; that\r\nthey have no right to use them for their own selfish benefit; but that\r\nthey should hold them rather, as Fenelon expresses it, as “a ministry,”\r\na stewardship, which they hold in trust for the benefit of their poorer\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\nIn some of the very highest circles in England and America we begin to\r\nsee illustrious examples of the commencement of such a condition of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nOne of the merchant princes of Boston, whose funeral has lately been\r\ncelebrated in our city, afforded in his life a beautiful example of this\r\ntruth. His wealth was the wealth of thousands. He was the steward of the\r\nwidow and the orphan. His funds were a savings bank, wherein were laid\r\nup the resources of the poor; and the mourners at his funeral were the\r\nscholars of the schools which he had founded, the officers of literary\r\ninstitutions which his munificence had endowed, the widows and orphans\r\nwhom he had counselled and supported, and the men, in all ranks and\r\nconditions of life, who had been made by his benevolence to feel that\r\nhis wealth was their wealth. May God raise up many men in Boston to\r\nenter into the spirit and labors of Amos Lawrence!\r\n\r\nThis is the _true_ socialism, which comes from the spirit of Christ,\r\nand, without breaking down existing orders of society, _by love_ makes\r\nthe property and possessions of the higher class the property of the\r\nlower.\r\n\r\nMen are always seeking to begin their reforms with the _outward_ and\r\n_physical_. Christ begins his reforms in the heart. Men would break up\r\nall ranks of society, and throw all property into a common stock; but\r\nChrist would inspire the higher class with that Divine Spirit by which\r\nall the wealth and means and advantages of their position are used for\r\nthe good of the lower.\r\n\r\nWe see, also, in the highest aristocracy of England, instances of the\r\nsame tendency.\r\n\r\nAmong her oldest nobility there begin to arise lecturers to mechanics\r\nand patrons of ragged schools; and it is said that even on the throne of\r\nEngland is a woman who weekly instructs her class of Sunday-school\r\nscholars from the children in the vicinity of her country residence.\r\n\r\nIn this way, and not by an outward and physical division of property,\r\nshall all things be had in common. And when the white race shall regard\r\ntheir superiority over the colored one only as a talent intrusted for\r\nthe advantage of their weaker brother, _then_ will the prejudice of\r\ncaste melt away in the light of Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                            MARIE ST. CLARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarie St. Clare is the type of a class of women not peculiar to any\r\nlatitude, nor any condition of society. She may be found in England or\r\nin America. In the northern free states we have many Marie St. Clares,\r\nmore or less fully developed.\r\n\r\nWhen found in a northern latitude, she is forever in trouble about her\r\ndomestic relations. Her servants never do anything right. Strange to\r\ntell, they are not perfect, and she thinks it a very great shame. She is\r\nfully convinced that she ought to have every moral and Christian virtue\r\nin her kitchen for a little less than the ordinary wages; and when her\r\ncook leaves her, because she finds she can get better wages and less\r\nwork in a neighboring family, she thinks it shockingly selfish,\r\nunprincipled conduct. She is of opinion that servants ought to be\r\nperfectly disinterested; that they ought to be willing to take up with\r\nthe worst rooms in the house, with very moderate wages, and very\r\nindifferent food, when they can get much better elsewhere, purely for\r\nthe sake of pleasing her. She likes to get hold of foreign servants, who\r\nhave not yet learned our ways, who are used to working for low wages,\r\nand who will be satisfied with almost anything; but she is often heard\r\nto lament that they soon get spoiled, and want as many privileges as\r\nanybody else,—which is perfectly shocking. Marie often wishes that she\r\ncould be a slave-holder, or could live somewhere where the lower class\r\nare kept down, and made to know their place. She is always hunting for\r\ncheap seamstresses, and will tell you, in an under-tone, that she has\r\ndiscovered a woman who will make linen shirts beautifully, stitch the\r\ncollars and wristbands twice, all for thirty-seven cents, when many\r\nseamstresses get a dollar for it; says she does it because she’s poor,\r\nand has no friends; thinks you had better be careful in your\r\nconversation, and not let her know what prices are, or else she will get\r\nspoiled, and go to raising her price,—these sewing-women are so selfish.\r\nWhen Marie St. Clare has the misfortune to live in a free state, there\r\nis no end to her troubles. Her cook is always going off for better wages\r\nand more comfortable quarters; her chambermaid, strangely enough, won’t\r\nagree to be chambermaid and seamstress both for half wages, and so she\r\ndeserts. Marie’s kitchen-cabinet, therefore, is always in a state of\r\nrevolution; and she often declares, with affecting earnestness, that\r\nservants are the torment of her life. If her husband endeavor to\r\nremonstrate, or suggest another mode of treatment, he is a hard-hearted,\r\nunfeeling man; “he doesn’t love her, and she always knew he didn’t;” and\r\nso he is disposed of.\r\n\r\nBut, when Marie comes under a system of laws which gives her absolute\r\ncontrol over her dependants,—which enables her to separate them, at her\r\npleasure, from their dearest family connections, or to inflict upon them\r\nthe most disgraceful and violent punishments, without even the restraint\r\nwhich seeing the execution might possibly produce,—then it is that the\r\ncharacter arrives at full maturity. Human nature is no worse at the\r\nSouth than at the North; but law at the South distinctly provides for\r\nand protects the worst abuses to which that nature is liable.\r\n\r\nIt is often supposed that domestic servitude in slave states is a kind\r\nof paradise; that house-servants are invariably pets; that young\r\nmistresses are always fond of their “mammies,” and young masters always\r\nhandsome, good-natured and indulgent.\r\n\r\nLet any one in Old England or New England look about among their\r\nimmediate acquaintances, and ask how many there are who would use\r\nabsolute despotic power amiably in a family, especially over a class\r\ndegraded by servitude, ignorant, indolent, deceitful, provoking, as\r\nslaves almost necessarily are, and always must be.\r\n\r\nLet them look into their own hearts, and ask themselves if they would\r\ndare to be trusted with such a power. Do they not find in themselves\r\ntemptations to be unjust to those who are inferiors and dependants? Do\r\nthey not find themselves tempted to be irritable and provoked, when the\r\nservice of their families is negligently performed? And, if they had the\r\npower to inflict cruel punishments, or to have them inflicted by sending\r\nthe servant out to some place of correction, would they not be tempted\r\nto use that liberty?\r\n\r\nWith regard to those degrading punishments to which females are\r\nsubjected, by being sent to professional whippers, or by having such\r\nfunctionaries sent for to the house,—as John Caphart testifies that he\r\nhas often been, in Baltimore,—what can be said of their influence both\r\non the superior and on the inferior class? It is very painful indeed to\r\ncontemplate this subject. The mind instinctively shrinks from it; but\r\nstill it is a very serious question whether it be not our duty to\r\nencounter this pain, that our sympathies may be quickened into more\r\nactive exercise. For this reason, we give here the testimony of a\r\ngentleman whose accuracy will not be doubted, and who subjected himself\r\nto the pain of being an eye-witness to a scene of this kind in the\r\ncalaboose in New Orleans. As the reader will perceive from the account,\r\nit was a scene of such every-day occurrence as not to excite any\r\nparticular remark, or any expression of sympathy from those of the same\r\ncondition and color with the sufferer.\r\n\r\nWhen our missionaries first went to India, it was esteemed a duty among\r\nChristian nations to make themselves acquainted with the cruelties and\r\natrocities of idolatrous worship, as a means of quickening our zeal to\r\nsend them the gospel.\r\n\r\nIf it be said that we in the free states have no such interest in\r\nslavery, as we do not support it, and have no power to prevent it, it is\r\nreplied that slavery does exist in the District of Columbia, which\r\nbelongs to the whole United States; and that the free states are, before\r\nGod, guilty of the crime of continuing it there, unless they will\r\nhonestly do what in them lies for its extermination.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined account was written by the benevolent Dr. Howe, whose\r\nlabors in behalf of the blind have rendered his name dear to humanity,\r\nand was sent in a letter to the Hon. Charles Sumner. If any one think it\r\ntoo painful to be perused, let him ask himself if God will hold those\r\nguiltless who suffer a system to continue, the details of which they\r\ncannot even read. That this describes a common scene in the calaboose,\r\nwe shall by and by produce other witnesses to show.\r\n\r\n  I have passed ten days in New Orleans, not unprofitably, I trust, in\r\n  examining the public institutions,—the schools, asylums, hospitals,\r\n  prisons, &c. With the exception of the first, there is little hope\r\n  of amelioration. I know not how much merit there may be in their\r\n  system; but I do know that, in the administration of the penal code,\r\n  there are abominations which should bring down the fate of Sodom\r\n  upon the city. If Howard or Mrs. Fry ever discovered so\r\n  ill-administered a den of thieves as the New Orleans prison, they\r\n  never described it. In the negro’s apartment I saw much which made\r\n  me blush that I was a white man, and which, for a moment, stirred up\r\n  an evil spirit in my animal nature. Entering a large paved\r\n  court-yard, around which ran galleries filled with slaves of all\r\n  ages, sexes and colors, I heard the snap of a whip, every stroke of\r\n  which sounded like the sharp crack of a pistol. I turned my head,\r\n  and beheld a sight which absolutely chilled me to the marrow of my\r\n  bones, and gave me, for the first time in my life, the sensation of\r\n  my hair stiffening at the roots. There lay a black girl flat upon\r\n  her face, on a board, her two thumbs tied, and fastened to one end,\r\n  her feet tied, and drawn tightly to the other end, while a strap\r\n  passed over the small of her back, and, fastened around the board,\r\n  compressed her closely to it. Below the strap she was entirely\r\n  naked. By her side, and six feet off, stood a huge negro, with a\r\n  long whip, which he applied with dreadful power and wonderful\r\n  precision. Every stroke brought away a strip of skin, which clung to\r\n  the lash, or fell quivering on the pavement, while the blood\r\n  followed after it. The poor creature writhed and shrieked, and, in a\r\n  voice which showed alike her fear of death and her dreadful agony,\r\n  screamed to her master, who stood at her head, “O, spare my life!\r\n  don’t cut my soul out!” But still fell the horrid lash; still strip\r\n  after strip peeled off from the skin; gash after gash was cut in her\r\n  living flesh, until it became a livid and bloody mass of raw and\r\n  quivering muscle. It was with the greatest difficulty I refrained\r\n  from springing upon the torturer, and arresting his lash; but, alas!\r\n  what could I do, but turn aside to hide my tears for the sufferer,\r\n  and my blushes for humanity? This was in a public and\r\n  regularly-organized prison; the punishment was one recognized and\r\n  authorized by the law. But think you the poor wretch had committed a\r\n  heinous offence, and had been convicted thereof, and sentenced to\r\n  the lash? Not at all. She was brought by her master to be whipped by\r\n  the common executioner, without trial, judge or jury, just at his\r\n  beck or nod, for some real or supposed offence, or to gratify his\r\n  own whim or malice. And he may bring her day after day, without\r\n  cause assigned, and inflict any number of lashes he pleases, short\r\n  of twenty-five, provided only he pays the fee. Or, if he choose, he\r\n  may have a private whipping-board on his own premises, and brutalize\r\n  himself there. A shocking part of this horrid punishment was its\r\n  publicity, as I have said; it was in a court-yard surrounded by\r\n  galleries, which were filled with colored persons of all\r\n  sexes,—runaway slaves, committed for some crime, or slaves up for\r\n  sale. You would naturally suppose they crowded forward, and gazed,\r\n  horror-stricken, at the brutal spectacle below; but they did not;\r\n  many of them hardly noticed it, and many were entirely indifferent\r\n  to it. They went on in their childish pursuits, and some were\r\n  laughing outright in the distant parts of the galleries; so low can\r\n  man, created in God’s image, be sunk in brutality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n                               ST. CLARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with pleasure that we turn from the dark picture just presented,\r\nto the character of the generous and noble-hearted St. Clare, wherein\r\nthe fairest picture of our Southern brother is presented.\r\n\r\nIt has been the writer’s object to separate carefully, as far as\r\npossible, the system from the men. It is her sincere belief that, while\r\nthe irresponsible power of slavery is such that no human being ought\r\never to possess it, probably that power was never exercised more\r\nleniently than in many cases in the Southern States. She has been\r\nastonished to see how, under all the disadvantages which attend the\r\nearly possession of arbitrary power, all the temptations which every\r\nreflecting mind must see will arise from the possession of this power in\r\nvarious forms, there are often developed such fine and interesting\r\ntraits of character. To say that these cases are common, alas! is not in\r\nour power. Men know human nature too well to believe us, if we should.\r\nBut the more dreadful the evil to be assailed, the more careful should\r\nwe be to be just in our apprehensions, and to balance the horror which\r\ncertain abuses must necessarily excite, by a consideration of those\r\nexcellent and redeeming traits which are often found in individuals\r\nconnected with the system.\r\n\r\nThe twin brothers, Alfred and Augustine St. Clare, represent two classes\r\nof men which are to be found in all countries. They are the radically\r\naristocratic and democratic men. The aristocrat by position is not\r\nalways the aristocrat by nature, and _vice versa_; but the aristocrat by\r\nnature, whether he be in a higher or lower position in society, is he\r\nwho, though he may be just, generous and humane, to those whom he\r\nconsiders his equals, is entirely insensible to the wants, and\r\nsufferings, and common humanity, of those whom he considers the lower\r\norders. The sufferings of a countess would make him weep; the sufferings\r\nof a seamstress are quite another matter.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the democrat is often found in the highest position\r\nof life. To this man, superiority to his brother is a thing which he can\r\nnever boldly and nakedly assert without a secret pain. In the lowest and\r\nhumblest walk of life, he acknowledges the sacredness of a common\r\nhumanity; and however degraded by the opinions and institutions of\r\nsociety any particular class may be, there is an instinctive feeling in\r\nhis soul which teaches him that they are _men_ of like passions with\r\nhimself. Such men have a penetration which at once sees through all the\r\nfalse shows of outward custom which make one man so dissimilar to\r\nanother, to those great generic capabilities, sorrows, wants and\r\nweaknesses, wherein all men and women are alike; and there is no such\r\nthing as making them realize that one order of human beings have any\r\nprescriptive right over another order, or that the tears and sufferings\r\nof one are not just as good as those of another order.\r\n\r\nThat such men are to be found at the South in the relation of\r\nslave-masters, that when so found they cannot and will not be deluded by\r\nany of the shams and sophistry wherewith slavery has been defended, that\r\nthey look upon it as a relic of a barbarous age, and utterly scorn and\r\ncontemn all its apologists, we can abundantly show. Many of the most\r\nillustrious Southern men of the Revolution were of this class, and many\r\nmen of distinguished position of later day have entertained the same\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nWitness the following letter of Patrick Henry, the sentiments of which\r\nare so much an echo of those of St. Clare that the reader might suppose\r\none to be a copy of the other:\r\n\r\n                        LETTER OF PATRICK HENRY.\r\n\r\n                                        _Hanover, January 18th, 1773._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: I take this opportunity to acknowledge the receipt of\r\n  Anthony Benezet’s book against the slave-trade; I thank you for it.\r\n  Is it not a little surprising that the professors of Christianity,\r\n  whose chief excellence consists in softening the human heart, in\r\n  cherishing and improving its finer feelings, should encourage a\r\n  practice so totally repugnant to the first impressions of right and\r\n  wrong? What adds to the wonder is, that this abominable practice has\r\n  been introduced in the most enlightened ages. Times that seem to\r\n  have pretensions to boast of high improvements in the arts and\r\n  sciences, and refined morality, have brought into general use, and\r\n  guarded by many laws, a species of violence and tyranny which our\r\n  more rude and barbarous, but more honest ancestors detested. Is it\r\n  not amazing that at a time when the rights of humanity are defined\r\n  and understood with precision, in a country above all others fond of\r\n  liberty,—that in such an age and in such a country we find men\r\n  professing a religion the most mild, humane, gentle and generous,\r\n  adopting such a principle, as repugnant to humanity as it is\r\n  inconsistent with the Bible, and destructive to liberty? Every\r\n  thinking, honest man rejects it in speculation. How free in practice\r\n  from conscientious motives!\r\n\r\n  Would any one believe that I am master of slaves of my own purchase?\r\n  I am drawn along by the general inconvenience of living here without\r\n  them. I will not, I cannot, justify it. However culpable my conduct,\r\n  I will so far pay my devoir to virtue as to own the excellence and\r\n  rectitude of her precepts, and lament my want of conformity to them.\r\n\r\n  I believe a time will come when an opportunity will be offered to\r\n  abolish this lamentable evil. Everything we can do is to improve it,\r\n  if it happens in our day; if not, let us transmit to our\r\n  descendants, together with our slaves, a pity for their unhappy lot,\r\n  and an abhorrence for slavery. If we cannot reduce this wished-for\r\n  reformation to practice, let us treat the unhappy victims with\r\n  lenity. It is the furthest advance we can make towards justice. It\r\n  is a debt we owe to the purity of our religion, to show that it is\r\n  at variance with that law which warrants slavery.\r\n\r\n  I know not when to stop. I could say many things on the subject, a\r\n  serious view of which gives _a gloomy prospect to future times_!\r\n\r\nWhat a sorrowful thing it is that such men live an inglorious life,\r\ndrawn along by the general current of society, when they ought to be its\r\nregenerators! Has God endowed them with such nobleness of soul, such\r\nclearness of perception, for nothing? Should they, to whom he has given\r\nsuperior powers of insight and feeling, live as all the world live?\r\n\r\nSouthern men of this class have often risen up to reprove the men of the\r\nNorth, when they are drawn in to apologize for the system of slavery.\r\nThus, on one occasion, a representative from one of the northern states,\r\na gentleman now occupying the very highest rank of distinction and\r\nofficial station, used in Congress the following language:\r\n\r\n  The great relation of servitude, in some form or other, with greater\r\n  or less departure from the theoretic equality of men, is inseparable\r\n  from our nature. Domestic slavery is not, in my judgment, to be set\r\n  down as an immoral or irreligious relation. The slaves of this\r\n  country are better clothed and fed than the peasantry of some of the\r\n  most prosperous states of Europe.\r\n\r\nHe was answered by Mr. Mitchell, of Tennessee, in these words:\r\n\r\n  Sir, I do not go the length of the gentleman from Massachusetts, and\r\n  hold that the existence of slavery in this country is almost a\r\n  blessing. On the contrary, I am firmly settled in the opinion that\r\n  it is a great curse,—one of the greatest that could have been\r\n  interwoven in our system. I, Mr. Chairman, am one of those whom\r\n  these poor wretches call masters. I do not task them; I feed and\r\n  clothe them well; but yet, alas! they are slaves, and slavery is a\r\n  curse in any shape. It is no doubt true that there are persons in\r\n  Europe far more degraded than our slaves,—worse fed, worse clothed,\r\n  &c., but, sir, this is far from proving that negroes ought to be\r\n  slaves.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated John Randolph, of Roanoke, said in Congress, on one\r\noccasion:\r\n\r\n  Sir, I envy neither the heart nor the head of that man from the\r\n  North who rises here to defend slavery on principle.\r\n\r\nThe following lines from the will of this eccentric man show that this\r\nclear sense of justice, which is a gift of superior natures, at last\r\nproduced some appropriate fruits in practice:\r\n\r\n  _I give to my slaves their freedom, to which my conscience tells me\r\n  they are justly entitled._ It has a long time been a matter of the\r\n  deepest regret to me, that the circumstances under which I inherited\r\n  them, and the obstacles thrown in the way by the laws of the land,\r\n  have prevented my emancipating them in my lifetime, which it is my\r\n  full intention to do in case I can accomplish it.\r\n\r\nThe influence on such minds as these of that kind of theological\r\nteaching which prevails in the majority of pulpits at the South, and\r\nwhich justifies slavery directly from the Bible, cannot be sufficiently\r\nregretted. Such men are shocked to find their spiritual teachers less\r\nconscientious than themselves; and if the Biblical argument succeeds in\r\nbewildering them, it produces scepticism with regard to the Bible\r\nitself. Professor Stowe states that, during his residence in Ohio, he\r\nvisited at the house of a gentleman who had once been a Virginian\r\nplanter, and during the first years of his life was an avowed sceptic.\r\nHe stated that his scepticism was entirely referable to this one\r\ncause,—that his minister had constructed a scriptural argument in\r\ndefence of slavery which he was unable to answer, and that his moral\r\nsense was so shocked by the idea that the Bible defended such an\r\natrocious system, that he became an entire unbeliever, and so continued\r\nuntil he came under the ministration of a clergyman in Ohio, who\r\nsucceeded in presenting to him the true scriptural view of the subject.\r\nHe immediately threw aside his scepticism, and became a member of a\r\nChristian church.\r\n\r\nSo we hear the _Baltimore Sun_, a paper in a slave state, and no way\r\nsuspected of leaning towards abolitionism, thus scornfully disposing of\r\nthe scriptural argument:\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Burgess, Taylor & Co., Sun Iron Building, send us a copy of\r\n  a work of imposing exterior, a handsome work of nearly six hundred\r\n  pages, from the pen of Rev. Josiah Priest, A.M., and published by\r\n  Rev. W. S. Brown, M.D., at Glasgow, Kentucky, the copy before us\r\n  conveying the assurance that it is the “fifth edition—stereotyped.”\r\n  And we have no doubt it is; and the _fiftieth_ edition may be\r\n  published; but it will amount to nothing, for there is nothing in\r\n  it. The book comprises the usually quoted facts associated with the\r\n  history of slavery as recorded in the Scriptures, accompanied by the\r\n  opinions and arguments of _another_ man in relation thereto. And\r\n  this sort of thing may go on to the end of time. It can accomplish\r\n  nothing towards the perpetuation of slavery. The book is called\r\n  “Bible Defence of Slavery; and Origin, Fortunes, and History, of the\r\n  Negro Race.” Bible defence of slavery! There is no such thing as a\r\n  Bible defence of slavery at the present day. Slavery in the United\r\n  States is a social institution, originating in the convenience and\r\n  cupidity of our ancestors, existing by state laws and recognized to\r\n  a certain extent—for the recovery of slave property—by the\r\n  constitution. And nobody would pretend that, if it were inexpedient\r\n  and unprofitable for any man or any state to continue to hold\r\n  slaves, they would be bound to do so, on the ground of a “Bible\r\n  defence” of it. Slavery is recorded in the Bible, and approved, with\r\n  many degrading characteristics. War is recorded in the Bible, and\r\n  approved, under what seems to us the extreme of cruelty. But are\r\n  slavery and war to _endure_ forever, because we find them in the\r\n  Bible? Or, are they to _cease_ at once and forever, because the\r\n  Bible inculcates peace and brotherhood?\r\n\r\n  The book before us exhibits great research, but is obnoxious to\r\n  severe criticism, on account of its gratuitous assumptions. The\r\n  writer is constantly assuming this, that, and the other. In a work\r\n  of this sort, a “doubtless” this, and “no doubt” the other, and\r\n  “such is our belief,” with respect to important premises, will not\r\n  be acceptable to the intelligent reader. Many of the positions\r\n  assumed are ludicrous; and the fancy of the writer runs to\r\n  exuberance in putting words and speeches into the mouths of the\r\n  ancients, predicated upon the brief record of Scripture history. The\r\n  argument from the _curse of Ham_ is not worth the paper it is\r\n  written upon. It is just equivalent to that of _Blackwood’s\r\n  Magazine_, we remember examining some years since, in reference to\r\n  the admission of Rothschild to Parliament. The writer maintained the\r\n  religious obligation of the _Christian_ public to perpetuate the\r\n  political disabilities of the Jews, because it would be resisting\r\n  the Divine will to remove them, in view of the “curse” which the\r\n  aforesaid Christian Pharisee understood to be levelled against the\r\n  sons of Abraham. Admitting that God has cursed both the Jewish race\r\n  and the descendants of Ham, He is able to fulfil His purpose, though\r\n  the “rest of mankind” should in all things act up to the benevolent\r\n  precepts of the “Divine law.” _Man_ may very safely cultivate the\r\n  highest principles of the Christian dispensation, and leave God to\r\n  work out the fulfilment of His _curse_.\r\n\r\n  According to the same book and the same logic, all mankind being\r\n  under a “curse,” none of us ought to work out any alleviation for\r\n  ourselves, and we are sinning heinously in harnessing steam to the\r\n  performance of manual labor, cutting wheat by McCormick’s\r\n  _diablerie_, and laying hold of the lightning to carry our messages\r\n  for us, instead of footing it ourselves as our father Adam did. With\r\n  a little more common sense, and much less of the uncommon sort, we\r\n  should better understand Scripture, the institutions under which we\r\n  live, the several rights of our fellow-citizens in all sections of\r\n  the country, and the good, sound, practical, social relations, which\r\n  ought to contribute infinitely more than they do to the happiness of\r\n  mankind.\r\n\r\nIf the reader wishes to know what kind of preaching it is that St. Clare\r\nalludes to, when he says he can learn what is quite as much to the\r\npurpose from the _Picayune_, and that such scriptural expositions of\r\ntheir peculiar relations don’t edify him much, he is referred to the\r\nfollowing extract from a sermon preached in New Orleans, by the Rev.\r\nTheophilus Clapp. Let our reader now imagine that he sees St. Clare\r\nseated in the front slip, waggishly taking notes of the following\r\nspecimen of ethics and humanity.\r\n\r\n  Let all Christian teachers show our servants the importance of being\r\n  submissive, obedient, industrious, honest and faithful to the\r\n  interests of their masters. Let their minds be filled with sweet\r\n  anticipations of rest eternal beyond the grave. Let them be trained\r\n  to direct their views to that fascinating and glorious futurity,\r\n  where the sins, sorrows, and troubles of earth, will be contemplated\r\n  under the aspect of means indispensable to our everlasting progress\r\n  in knowledge, virtue and happiness. I would say to every slave in\r\n  the United States, “You should realize that a wise, kind, and\r\n  merciful Providence has appointed for you your condition in life;\r\n  and, all things considered, you could not be more eligibly situated.\r\n  The burden of your care, toils and responsibilities, is much lighter\r\n  than that which God has imposed on your master. The most enlightened\r\n  philanthropists, with unlimited resources, could not place you in a\r\n  situation more favorable to your present and everlasting welfare\r\n  than that which you now occupy. You have your troubles. So have all.\r\n  Remember how evanescent are the pleasures and joys of human life.”\r\n\r\nBut, as Mr. Clapp will not, perhaps, be accepted as a representation of\r\northodoxy, let him be supposed to listen to the following declarations\r\nof the Rev. James Smylie, a clergyman of great influence in the\r\nPresbyterian church, in a tract upon slavery, which he states in the\r\nintroduction to have been written with particular reference to removing\r\nthe conscientious scruples of religious people in Mississippi and\r\nLouisiana, with regard to its propriety.\r\n\r\n  If I believed, or was of opinion, that it was the legitimate\r\n  tendency of the gospel to abolish slavery, how would I approach a\r\n  man, possessing as many slaves as Abraham had, and tell him I wished\r\n  to obtain his permission to preach to his slaves?\r\n\r\n  Suppose the man to be ignorant of the gospel, and that he would\r\n  inquire of me what was my object. I would tell him candidly (and\r\n  every minister ought to be candid) that I wished to preach the\r\n  gospel, because its legitimate tendency is to make his slaves\r\n  honest, trusty and faithful: not serving “with eye service, as men\r\n  pleasers,” “not purloining, but showing all good fidelity.” “And is\r\n  this,” he would ask, “really the tendency of the gospel?” I would\r\n  answer, Yes. Then I might expect that a man who had a thousand\r\n  slaves, if he believed me, would not only permit me to preach to his\r\n  slaves, but would do more. He would be willing to build me a house,\r\n  furnish me a garden, and ample provision for a support. Because, he\r\n  would conclude, _verily, that this preacher would be worth more to\r\n  him than a dozen overseers_. But, suppose, then, he would tell me\r\n  that he had understood that the tendency of the gospel was to\r\n  abolish slavery, and inquire of me if that was the fact. Ah! this is\r\n  the rub. He has now cornered me. What shall I say? Shall I, like a\r\n  dishonest man, twist and dodge, and shift and turn, to evade an\r\n  answer? No. I must Kentuckian like, come out, _broad, flat-footed_,\r\n  and tell him that _abolition is the tendency of the gospel_. What am\r\n  I now to calculate upon? I have told the man that it is the tendency\r\n  of the gospel to make him so poor as to oblige him to take hold of\r\n  the maul and wedge himself; he must catch, curry, and saddle his own\r\n  horse; he must black his own _brogans_ (for he will not be able to\r\n  buy boots). His wife must go, herself, to the wash-tub, take hold of\r\n  the scrubbing-broom, wash the pots, and cook all that she and her\r\n  rail mauler will eat.\r\n\r\n  _Query._—Is it to be expected that a master ignorant heretofore of\r\n  the tendency of the gospel would fall so desperately in love with\r\n  it, from a knowledge of its tendency, that he would encourage the\r\n  preaching of it among his slaves? Verily, NO.\r\n\r\n  But suppose, when he put the last question to me, as to its\r\n  tendency, I _could_ and _would_, without a twist or quibble, tell\r\n  him, _plainly_ and _candidly_, that it was a slander on the gospel\r\n  to say that emancipation or abolition was its legitimate tendency. I\r\n  would tell him that the commandments of _some_ men, and not the\r\n  commandments of God, made slavery a sin.—_Smylie on Slavery_, p. 71.\r\n\r\nOne can imagine the expression of countenance and tone of voice with\r\nwhich St. Clare would receive such expositions of the gospel. It is to\r\nbe remarked that this tract does not contain the opinions of one man\r\nonly, but that it has in its appendix a letter from two ecclesiastical\r\nbodies of the Presbyterian church, substantially endorsing its\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nCan any one wonder that a man like St. Clare should put such questions\r\nas these?\r\n\r\n“Is what you hear at church religion? Is that which can bend and turn,\r\nand descend and ascend, to fit every crooked phase of selfish, worldly\r\nsociety, religion? Is _that_ religion, which is less scrupulous, less\r\ngenerous, less just, less considerate for man, than even my own ungodly,\r\nworldly, blinded nature? No! When I look for a religion, I must look for\r\nsomething above me, and not something beneath.”\r\n\r\nThe character of St. Clare was drawn by the writer with enthusiasm and\r\nwith hope. Will this hope never be realized? Will those men at the\r\nSouth, to whom God has given the power to perceive and the heart to feel\r\nthe unutterable wrong and injustice of slavery, always remain silent and\r\ninactive? What nobler ambition to a Southern man than to deliver his\r\ncountry from this disgrace? From the South must the deliverer arise. How\r\nlong shall he delay? There is a crown brighter than any earthly ambition\r\nhas ever worn,—there is a laurel which will not fade: it is prepared and\r\nwaiting for that hero who shall rise up for liberty at the South, and\r\nfree that noble and beautiful country from the burden and disgrace of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n                                LEGREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs St. Clare and the Shelbys are the representatives of one class of\r\nmasters, so Legree is the representative of another; and, as all good\r\nmasters are not as enlightened, as generous, and as considerate, as St.\r\nClare and Mr. Shelby, or as careful and successful in religious training\r\nas Mrs. Shelby, so all bad masters do not unite the personal ugliness,\r\nthe coarseness and profaneness, of Legree.\r\n\r\nLegree is introduced not for the sake of vilifying masters as a class,\r\nbut for the sake of bringing to the minds of honorable Southern men, who\r\nare masters, a very important feature in the system of slavery, upon\r\nwhich, perhaps, they have never reflected. It is this: that _no Southern\r\nlaw requires any test of_ CHARACTER _from the man to whom the absolute\r\npower of master is granted_.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of this book it will be shown that the legal power of\r\nthe master amounts to an absolute despotism over body and soul; and that\r\nthere is no protection for the slave’s life or limb, his family\r\nrelations, his conscience, nay, more, his eternal interests, but the\r\nCHARACTER of the master.\r\n\r\nRev. Charles C. Jones, of Georgia, in addressing masters, tells them\r\nthat they have the power to open the kingdom of heaven or to shut it, to\r\ntheir slaves (_Religious Instruction of the Negroes_, p. 158), and a\r\nSouth Carolinian, in a recent article in _Fraser’s Magazine_, apparently\r\nin a very serious spirit, thus acknowledges the fact of this awful\r\npower: “Yes, we would have the whole South to feel that the _soul_ of\r\nthe slave is in some sense in the master’s keeping, and to be charged\r\nagainst him hereafter.”\r\n\r\nNow, it is respectfully submitted to men of this high class, who are the\r\nlaw-makers, whether this awful power to bind and to loose, to open and\r\nto shut the kingdom of heaven, ought to be intrusted to every man in the\r\ncommunity, without any other qualification than that of property to buy.\r\nLet this gentleman of South Carolina cast his eyes around the world. Let\r\nhim travel for one week through any district of country either in the\r\nSouth or the North, and ask himself how many of the men whom he meets\r\nare fit to be trusted with this power,—how many are fit to be trusted\r\nwith their own souls, much less with those of others?\r\n\r\nNow, in all the theory of government as it is managed in our country,\r\njust in proportion to the extent of power is the strictness with which\r\nqualification for the proper exercise of it is demanded. The physician\r\nmay not meddle with the body, to prescribe for its ailments, without a\r\ncertificate that he is properly qualified. The judge may not decide on\r\nthe laws which relate to property, without a long course of training,\r\nand most abundant preparation. It is only this office of MASTER, which\r\ncontains the power to bind and to loose, and to open and shut the\r\nkingdom of heaven, and involves responsibility for the soul as well as\r\nthe body, that is thrown out to every hand, and committed without\r\ninquiry to any man of any character. A man may have made all his\r\nproperty by piracy upon the high seas, as we have represented in the\r\ncase of Legree, and there is no law whatever to prevent his investing\r\nthat property in acquiring this absolute control over the souls and\r\nbodies of his fellow-beings. To the half-maniac drunkard, to the man\r\nnotorious for hardness and cruelty, to the man sunk entirely below\r\npublic opinion, to the bitter infidel and blasphemer, the law confides\r\nthis power, just as freely as to the most honorable and religious man on\r\nearth. And yet, men who make and uphold these laws think they are\r\nguiltless before God, because individually they do not perpetrate the\r\nwrongs which they allow others to perpetrate!\r\n\r\nTo the pirate Legree the law gives a power which no man of woman born,\r\nsave One, ever was good enough to exercise.\r\n\r\nAre there such men as Legree? Let any one go into the low districts and\r\ndens of New York, let them go into some of the lanes and alleys of\r\nLondon, and will they not there see many Legrees? Nay, take the purest\r\ndistrict of New England, and let people cast about in their memory and\r\nsee if there have not been men there, hard, coarse, unfeeling, brutal,\r\nwho, if they had possessed the absolute power of Legree, would have used\r\nit in the same way; and that there should be Legrees in the Southern\r\nStates, is only saying that human nature is the same there that it is\r\neverywhere. The only difference is this,—that in free states Legree is\r\nchained and restrained by law; in the slave states, the law makes him an\r\nabsolute, irresponsible despot.\r\n\r\nIt is a shocking task to confirm by fact this part of the writer’s\r\nstory. One may well approach it in fear and trembling. It is so mournful\r\nto think that man, made in the image of God, and by his human birth a\r\nbrother of Jesus Christ, can sink so low, can do such things as the very\r\nsoul shudders to contemplate,—and to think that the very man who thus\r\nsinks is our brother,—is capable, like us, of the renewal by the Spirit\r\nof grace, by which he might be created in the image of Christ and be\r\nmade equal unto the angels. They who uphold the laws which grant this\r\nawful power have another heavy responsibility, of which they little\r\ndream. How many souls of masters have been ruined through it! How has\r\nthis absolute authority provoked and developed wickedness which\r\notherwise might have been suppressed! How many have stumbled into\r\neverlasting perdition over this stumbling-stone of IRRESPONSIBLE POWER!\r\n\r\nWhat facts do the judicial trials of slaveholding states occasionally\r\ndevelop! What horrible records defile the pages of the law-book,\r\ndescribing unheard-of scenes of torture and agony, perpetrated in this\r\nnineteenth century of the Christian era, by the irresponsible despot who\r\nowns the body and soul! Let any one read, if they can, the ninety-third\r\npage of Weld’s _Slavery as It Is_, where the Rev. Mr. Dickey gives an\r\naccount of a trial in Kentucky for a deed of butchery and blood too\r\nrepulsive to humanity to be here described. The culprit was convicted,\r\nand _sentenced_ to death. Mr. Dickey’s account of the finale is thus:\r\n\r\n  The Court sat—Isham was judged to be guilty of a capital crime in\r\n  the affair of George. He was to be hanged at Salem. The day was set.\r\n  My good old father visited him in the prison—two or three times\r\n  talked and prayed with him; I visited him once myself. We fondly\r\n  hoped that he was a sincere penitent. Before the day of execution\r\n  came, by some means, I never knew what, Isham was _missing_. About\r\n  two years after, we learned that he had gone down to Natchez, and\r\n  had married a lady of some refinement and piety. I saw her letters\r\n  to his sisters, who were worthy members of the church of which I was\r\n  pastor. The last letter told of his death. He was in Jackson’s army,\r\n  and fell in the famous battle of New Orleans.\r\n\r\n                                           I am, sir, your friend,\r\n                                                           WM. DICKEY.\r\n\r\nBut the reader will have too much reason to know of the possibility of\r\nthe existence of such men as Legree, when he comes to read the records\r\nof the trials and judicial decisions in Part II.\r\n\r\nLet not the Southern country be taunted as the only country in the world\r\nwhich produces such men;—let us in sorrow and in humility concede that\r\nsuch men are found everywhere; but let not the Southern country deny the\r\nawful charge that she invests such men with absolute, irresponsible\r\npower over both the body and the soul.\r\n\r\nWith regard to that atrocious system of working up the human being in a\r\ngiven time, on which Legree is represented as conducting his plantation,\r\nthere is unfortunately too much reason to know that it has been\r\npractised and is still practised.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Weld’s book, “Slavery as It Is,” under the head of Labor, p. 39,\r\nare given several extracts from various documents, to show that this\r\nsystem has been pursued on some plantations to such an extent as to\r\nshorten life, and to prevent the increase of the slave population, so\r\nthat, unless annually renewed, it would of itself die out. Of these\r\ndocuments we quote the following:\r\n\r\n  The Agricultural Society of Baton Rouge, La., in its report,\r\n  published in 1829, furnishes a labored estimate of the amount of\r\n  expenditure necessarily incurred in conducting “a well-regulated\r\n  sugar estate.” In this estimate, the annual net loss of slaves, over\r\n  and above the supply by propagation, is set down at TWO AND A HALF\r\n  PER CENT.! The late Hon. Josiah S. Johnson, a member of Congress\r\n  from Louisiana, addressed a letter to the Secretary of the United\r\n  States’ Treasury, in 1830, containing a similar estimate, apparently\r\n  made with great care, and going into minute details. Many items in\r\n  this estimate differ from the preceding; but the estimate of the\r\n  annual _decrease_ of the slaves on a plantation was the same,—TWO\r\n  AND A HALF PER CENT.!\r\n\r\n  In September, 1834, the writer of this had an interview with James\r\n  G. Birney, Esq., who then resided in Kentucky, having removed, with\r\n  his family, from Alabama, the year before. A few hours before that\r\n  interview, and on the morning of the same day, Mr. B. had spent a\r\n  couple of hours with Hon. Henry Clay, at his residence, near\r\n  Lexington. Mr. Birney remarked that Mr. Clay had just told him he\r\n  had lately been led to mistrust certain estimates as to the increase\r\n  of the slave population in the far South-west,—estimates which he\r\n  had presented, I think, in a speech before the Colonization Society.\r\n  He now believed that the births among the slaves in that quarter\r\n  were _not equal to the deaths_; and that, of course, the slave\r\n  population, independent of immigration from the slave-selling\r\n  states, was _not sustaining itself_.\r\n\r\n  Among other facts stated by Mr. Clay was the following, which we\r\n  copy _verbatim_ from the original memorandum made at the time by Mr.\r\n  Birney, with which he has kindly furnished us.\r\n\r\n  “_Sept. 16, 1834._—Hon. H. Clay, in a conversation at his own house\r\n  on the subject of slavery, informed me that Hon. Outerbridge\r\n  Horsey—formerly a senator in Congress from the State of Delaware,\r\n  and the owner of a sugar plantation in Louisiana—declared to him\r\n  that his overseer worked his hands so closely that one of the women\r\n  brought forth a child whilst engaged in the labors of the field.\r\n\r\n  “Also that, a few years since, he was at a brick-yard in the\r\n  environs of New Orleans, in which one hundred hands were employed;\r\n  among them were from _twenty to thirty young women_, in the prime of\r\n  life. He was told by the proprietor that there had _not been a child\r\n  born among them for the last two or three years, although they all\r\n  had husbands_.”\r\n\r\n  The late Mr. Samuel Blackwell, a highly-respected citizen of Jersey\r\n  City, opposite the city of New York, and a member of the\r\n  Presbyterian church, visited many of the sugar plantations in\r\n  Louisiana a few years since; and having, for many years, been the\r\n  owner of an extensive sugar refinery in England, and subsequently in\r\n  this country, he had not only every facility afforded him by the\r\n  planters for personal inspection of all parts of the process of\r\n  sugar-making, but received from them the most unreserved\r\n  communications as to their management of their slaves. Mr. B., after\r\n  his return, frequently made the following statement to gentlemen of\r\n  his acquaintance:—“That the planters generally declared to him that\r\n  they were _obliged_ so to over-work their slaves, during the\r\n  sugar-making season (from eight to ten weeks), as to _use them up_\r\n  in seven or eight years. For, said they, after the process is\r\n  commenced, it must be pushed, without cessation, night and day; and\r\n  we cannot afford to keep a sufficient number of slaves to do the\r\n  _extra_ work at the time of sugar-making, as we could not profitably\r\n  employ them the rest of the year.”\r\n\r\n  Dr. Demming, a gentleman of high respectability, residing in\r\n  Ashland, Richland County, Ohio, stated to Professor Wright, of New\r\n  York city,\r\n\r\n  “That, during a recent tour at the South, while ascending the Ohio\r\n  river, on the steamboat Fame, he had an opportunity of conversing\r\n  with a Mr. Dickinson, a resident of Pittsburg, in company with a\r\n  number of cotton-planters and slave-dealers from Louisiana, Alabama\r\n  and Mississippi. Mr. Dickinson stated as a fact, that the\r\n  sugar-planters upon the sugar-coast in Louisiana had ascertained\r\n  that, as it was usually necessary to employ about _twice_ the amount\r\n  of labor during the boiling season that was required during the\r\n  season of raising, they could, by excessive driving, day and night,\r\n  during the boiling season, accomplish the whole labor _with one set\r\n  of hands_. By pursuing this plan, they could afford _to sacrifice a\r\n  set of hands once in seven years_! He further stated that this\r\n  horrible system was now practised to a considerable extent! The\r\n  correctness of this statement was substantially admitted by the\r\n  slave-holders then on board.”\r\n\r\n  The following testimony of Rev. Dr. Channing, of Boston, who resided\r\n  some time in Virginia, shows that the over-working of slaves, to\r\n  such an extent as to abridge life, and cause a decrease of\r\n  population, is not confined to the far South and South-west.\r\n\r\n  “I heard of an estate managed by an individual who was considered as\r\n  singularly successful, and who was able to govern the slaves without\r\n  the use of the whip. I was anxious to see him; and trusted that some\r\n  discovery had been made favorable to humanity. I asked him how he\r\n  was able to dispense with corporal punishment. He replied to me,\r\n  with a very determined look, ‘The slaves know that the work _must_\r\n  be done, and that it is better to do it without punishment than with\r\n  it.’ In other words, the certainty and dread of chastisement were so\r\n  impressed on them that they never incurred it.\r\n\r\n  “I then found that the slaves on this well-managed estate\r\n  _decreased_ in number. I asked the cause. He replied, with perfect\r\n  frankness and ease, ‘The gang is not large enough for the estate.’\r\n  In other words, they were not equal to the work of the plantation,\r\n  and yet were _made to do it_, though with the certainty of abridging\r\n  life.\r\n\r\n  “On this plantation the huts were uncommonly convenient. There was\r\n  an unusual air of neatness. A superficial observer would have called\r\n  the slaves happy. Yet they were living under a severe, subduing\r\n  discipline, and were _over-worked_ to a degree that _shortened\r\n  life_.”—_Channing on Slavery_, page 162, first edition.\r\n\r\nA friend of the writer—the Rev. Mr. Barrows, now officiating as teacher\r\nof Hebrew in Andover Theological Seminary—stated the following, in\r\nconversation with her:—That, while at New Orleans, some time since, he\r\nwas invited by a planter to visit his estate, as he considered it to be\r\na model one. He found good dwellings for the slaves, abundant provision\r\ndistributed to them, all cruel punishments superseded by rational and\r\nreasonable ones, and half a day every week allowed to the negroes to\r\ncultivate their own grounds. Provision was also made for their moral and\r\nreligious instruction. Mr. Barrows then asked the planter,\r\n\r\n“Do you consider your estate a fair specimen?” The gentleman replied,\r\n“There are two systems pursued among us. One is, to make all we can out\r\nof a negro in a few years, and then supply his place with another; and\r\nthe other is, to treat him as I do. My neighbor on the next plantation\r\npursues the opposite system. His boys are hard worked and scantily fed;\r\nand I have had them come to me, and get down on their knees to beg me to\r\nbuy them.”\r\n\r\nMr. Barrows says he subsequently passed by this plantation, and that the\r\nwoe-struck, dejected aspect of its laborers fully confirmed the account.\r\nHe also says that the gentleman who managed so benevolently told him, “I\r\ndo not make much money out of my slaves.”\r\n\r\nIt will be easy to show that such is the nature of slavery, and the\r\ntemptations of masters, that such well-regulated plantations are and\r\nmust be infinitely in the minority, and exceptional cases.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Charles C. Jones, a man of the finest feelings of humanity, and\r\nfor many years an assiduous laborer for the benefit of the slave,\r\nhimself the owner of a plantation, and qualified, therefore, to judge,\r\nboth by experience and observation, says, after speaking of the great\r\nimprovidence of the negroes, engendered by slavery:\r\n\r\n  And, indeed, once for all, I will here say that the wastes of the\r\n  system are so great, as well as the fluctuation in prices of the\r\n  staple articles for market, that it is _difficult, nay, impossible_,\r\n  to indulge in large expenditures on plantations, and make them\r\n  savingly profitable.—_Religious Instruction_, p. 116.\r\n\r\nIf even the religious and benevolent master feels the difficulty of\r\nuniting any great consideration for the comfort of the slave with\r\nprudence and economy, how readily must the moral question be solved by\r\nminds of the coarse style of thought which we have supposed in Legree!\r\n\r\n  “I used to, when I first begun, have considerable trouble fussin’\r\n  with ‘em, and trying to make ‘em hold out,—doctorin’ on ‘em up when\r\n  they’s sick, and givin’ on ‘em clothes, and blankets, and what not,\r\n  trying to keep ‘em all sort o’ decent and comfortable. Law, ‘twant\r\n  no sort o’ use; I lost money on ‘em, and ‘twas heaps o’ trouble.\r\n  Now, you see, I just put ‘em straight through, sick or well. When\r\n  one nigger’s dead, I buy another; and I find it comes cheaper and\r\n  easier every way.”\r\n\r\nAdded to this, the peculiar mode of labor on the sugar plantation is\r\nsuch that the master, at a certain season of the year, must over-work\r\nhis slaves, unless he is willing to incur great pecuniary loss. In that\r\nvery gracefully written apology for slavery, Professor Ingraham’s\r\n“Travels in the South-west,” the following description of sugar-making\r\nis given. We quote from him in preference to any one else, because he\r\nspeaks as an apologist, and describes the thing with the grace of a Mr.\r\nSkimpole.\r\n\r\n  When the grinding has once commenced, there is no cessation of labor\r\n  till it is completed. From beginning to end a busy and cheerful\r\n  scene continues. The negroes,\r\n\r\n                         “—— Whose sore task\r\n               Does not divide the Sunday from the week,”\r\n\r\n  work from eighteen to twenty hours,\r\n\r\n            “And make the night joint laborer with the day;”\r\n\r\n  though, to lighten the burden as much as possible, the gang is\r\n  divided into two watches, one taking the first and the other the\r\n  last part of the night; and, notwithstanding this continued labor,\r\n  the negroes improve in appearance, and appear fat and flourishing.\r\n  They drink freely of cane-juice, and the sickly among them revive,\r\n  and become robust and healthy.\r\n\r\n  After the grinding is finished, the negroes have several holidays,\r\n  when they are quite at liberty to dance and frolic as much as they\r\n  please; and the cane-song—which is improvised by one of the gang,\r\n  the rest all joining in a prolonged and unintelligible chorus—now\r\n  breaks, night and day, upon the ear, in notes “most musical, most\r\n  melancholy.”\r\n\r\nThe above is inserted as a specimen of the facility with which the most\r\nhorrible facts may be told in the genteelest phrase. In a work entitled\r\n“Travels in Louisiana in 1802” is the following extract (see Weld’s\r\n“Slavery as It Is,” p. 134), from which it appears that this _cheerful_\r\nprocess of laboring night and day lasts _three months_!\r\n\r\n  “At the rolling of sugars, an interval of from two to three months,\r\n  they (the slaves in Louisiana) work _both night and day_. Abridged\r\n  of their sleep, they scarcely retire to rest during the whole\r\n  period.”\r\n\r\nNow, let any one learn the private history of seven hundred blacks,—men\r\nand women,—compelled to work day and night, under the lash of a driver,\r\nfor a period of three months.\r\n\r\nPossibly, if the gentleman who wrote this account were employed, with\r\nhis wife and family, in this “cheerful scene” of labor,—if he saw the\r\nwoman that he loved, the daughter who was dear to him as his own soul,\r\nforced on in the general gang, in this toil which\r\n\r\n            “Does not divide the Sabbath from the week,\r\n            And makes the night joint laborer with the day,”\r\n\r\n—possibly, if he saw all this, he might have another opinion of its\r\ncheerfulness; and it might be an eminently salutary thing if every\r\napologist for slavery were to enjoy some such privilege for a season,\r\nparticularly as Mr. Ingraham is careful to tell us that its effect upon\r\nthe general health is so excellent that the negroes improve in\r\nappearance, and appear fat and flourishing, and that the sickly among\r\nthem revive, and become robust and healthy. One would think it a\r\nsurprising fact, if working slaves night and day, and giving them\r\ncane-juice to drink, really produces such salutary results, that the\r\npractice should not be continued the whole year round; though, perhaps,\r\nin this case, the negroes would become so fat as to be unable to labor.\r\nPossibly, it is because this healthful process is not longer continued\r\nthat the agricultural societies of Louisiana are obliged to set down an\r\nannual loss of slaves on sugar plantations to the amount of two and a\r\nhalf per cent. This ought to be looked into by philanthropists. Perhaps\r\nworking them all night for six months, instead of three, might remedy\r\nthe evil.\r\n\r\nBut this periodical pressure is not confined to the making of sugar.\r\nThere is also a press in the cotton season, as any one can observe by\r\nreading the Southern newspapers. At a certain season of the year, the\r\nwhole interest of the community is engaged in gathering in the cotton\r\ncrop. Concerning this Mr. Weld says (“Slavery as It Is,” page 34):\r\n\r\n  In the cotton and sugar region there is a fearful amount of\r\n  desperate gambling, in which, though money is the ostensible stake\r\n  and forfeit, _human life_ is the real one. The length to which this\r\n  rivalry is carried at the South and South-west, the multitude of\r\n  planters who engage in it, and the recklessness of human life\r\n  exhibited in driving the murderous game to its issue, cannot well be\r\n  imagined by one who has not lived in the midst of it. Desire of gain\r\n  is only one of the motives that stimulates them; the _éclat_ of\r\n  having made the largest crop with a given number of hands is also a\r\n  powerful stimulant; the Southern newspapers, at the crop season,\r\n  chronicle carefully the “cotton brag,” and the “crack\r\n  cotton-picking,” and “unparalleled driving,” &c. Even the editors of\r\n  professedly religious papers cheer on the _mêlée_, and sing the\r\n  triumphs of the victor. Among these we recollect the celebrated Rev.\r\n  J. N. Maffit, recently editor of a religious paper at Natchez,\r\n  Miss., in which he took care to assign a prominent place and\r\n  capitals to “THE COTTON BRAG.”\r\n\r\nAs a specimen, of recent date, of this kind of affair, we subjoin the\r\nfollowing from the _Fairfield Herald_, Winsboro’, S. C., Nov. 4, 1852.\r\n\r\n                            COTTON-PICKING.\r\n\r\n  We find in many of our southern and western exchanges notices of the\r\n  amount of cotton picked by hands, and the quantity by each hand;\r\n  and, as we have received a similar account, which we have not seen\r\n  excelled, so far as regards the quantity picked by one hand, we with\r\n  pleasure furnish the statement, with the remark that it is from a\r\n  citizen of this district, overseeing for Maj. H. W. Parr.\r\n\r\n                                        “_Broad River, Oct. 12, 1852._\r\n\r\n  “MESSRS. EDITORS:—By way of contributing something to your variety\r\n  (provided it meets your approbation), I send you the return of a\r\n  day’s picking of cotton, not by picked hands, but the fag end of a\r\n  set of hands on one plantation, the able-bodied hands having been\r\n  drawn out for other purposes. Now for the result of a day’s picking,\r\n  from sun-up until sun-down, by twenty-two hands,—women, boys, and\r\n  two men:—four thousand eight hundred and eighty pounds of clean\r\n  picked cotton, from the stalk.\r\n\r\n  “The highest, three hundred and fifty pounds, by several; the\r\n  lowest, one hundred and fifteen pounds. One of the number has picked\r\n  in the last seven and a half days (Sunday excepted), eleven hours\r\n  each day, nineteen hundred pounds clean cotton. When any of my\r\n  agricultural friends beat this, in the same time, and during\r\n  sunshine, I will try again.\r\n\r\n                                                       JAMES STEWARD.”\r\n\r\nIt seems that this agriculturist professes to have accomplished all\r\nthese extraordinary results with what he very elegantly terms the “fag\r\nend” of a set of hands; and, the more to exalt his glory in the matter,\r\nhe distinctly informs the public that there were no “able-bodied” hands\r\nemployed; that this whole triumphant result was worked out of women and\r\nchildren, and two disabled men; in other words, he boasts that out of\r\nwomen and children, and the feeble and sickly, _he_ has extracted four\r\nthousand eight hundred and eighty pounds of clean picked cotton in a\r\nday; and that one of these same hands has been made to pick nineteen\r\nhundred pounds of clean cotton in a week! and adds, complacently, that,\r\nwhen any of his agricultural friends beat this, in the same time, and\r\nduring sunshine, he “will try again.”\r\n\r\nWill any of our readers now consider the forcing up of the hands on\r\nLegree’s plantation an exaggeration? Yet see how complacently this\r\naccount is quoted by the editor, as a most praiseworthy and laudable\r\nthing!\r\n\r\n“BEHOLD THE HIRE OF THE LABORERS WHO HAVE REAPED DOWN YOUR FIELDS, WHICH\r\nIS OF YOU KEPT BACK BY FRAUD, CRIETH! AND THE CRIES OF THEM WHICH HAVE\r\nREAPED ARE ENTERED INTO THE EARS OF THE LORD OF SABAOTH.”\r\n\r\nThat the representations of the style of dwelling-house, modes of\r\nhousekeeping, and, in short, the features of life generally, as\r\ndescribed on Legree’s plantation, are not wild and fabulous drafts on\r\nthe imagination, or exaggerated pictures of exceptional cases, there is\r\nthe most abundant testimony before the world, and has been for a long\r\nnumber of years. Let the reader weigh the following testimony with\r\nregard to the dwellings of the negroes, which has been for some years\r\nbefore the world, in the work of Mr. Weld. It shows the state of things\r\nin this respect, at least up to the year 1838.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Stephen E. Maltby, Inspector of Provisions, Skaneateles, N. Y.,\r\n  who has lived in Alabama.—“The huts where the slaves slept generally\r\n  contained but _one_ apartment, and that _without floor_.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. George A. Avery, elder of the 4th Presbyterian Church,\r\n  Rochester, N. Y., who lived four years in Virginia.—“Amongst all the\r\n  negro cabins which I saw in Virginia, _I cannot call to mind one_ in\r\n  which there was any other floor than the _earth_; anything that a\r\n  Northern laborer, or mechanic, white or colored, would call a _bed_,\r\n  nor a solitary _partition_, to separate the sexes.”\r\n\r\n  William Ladd, Esq., Minot, Maine, President of the American Peace\r\n  Society, formerly a slave-holder in Florida.—“The dwellings of the\r\n  slaves were palmetto huts, built by themselves of stakes and poles,\r\n  thatched with the palmetto-leaf. The door, when they had any, was\r\n  generally of the same materials, sometimes boards found on the\r\n  beach. They had _no floors_, no separate apartments; except the\r\n  Guinea negroes had sometimes a small enclosure for their ‘god\r\n  houses.’ These huts the slaves built themselves after task and on\r\n  Sundays.”\r\n\r\n  Rev. Joseph M. Sadd, pastor Presbyterian Church, Castile, Greene\r\n  Co., N. Y., who lived in Missouri five years previous to 1837.—“The\r\n  slaves live _generally_ in _miserable huts_, which are _without\r\n  floors_; and have a single apartment only, where both sexes are\r\n  herded promiscuously together.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. George W. Westgate, member of the Congregational church in\r\n  Quincy, Illinois, who has spent a number of years in slave\r\n  states.—“On old plantations the negro quarters are of frame and\r\n  clapboards, seldom affording a comfortable shelter from wind or\r\n  rain; their size varies from eight by ten to ten by twelve feet, and\r\n  six or eight feet high; sometimes there is a hole cut for a window,\r\n  but I never saw a sash, or glass, in any. In the new country, and in\r\n  the woods, the quarters are generally built of logs, of similar\r\n  dimensions.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Cornelius Johnson, a member of a Christian church in Farmington,\r\n  Ohio. Mr. J. lived in Mississippi in 1837–8.—“Their houses were\r\n  commonly built of logs; sometimes they were framed, often they had\r\n  no floor; some of them have two apartments, commonly but one; each\r\n  of those apartments contained a family. Sometimes these families\r\n  consisted of a man and his wife and children, while in other\r\n  instances persons of both sexes were thrown together, without any\r\n  regard to family relationship.”\r\n\r\n  The _Western Medical Reformer_, in an article on the Cachexia\r\n  Africana, by a Kentucky physician, thus speaks of the huts of the\r\n  slaves: “They are _crowded_ together in a _small hut_, and sometimes\r\n  having an imperfect and sometimes no floor, and seldom raised from\r\n  the ground, ill ventilated, and surrounded with filth.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. William Leftwich, a native of Virginia, but has resided most of\r\n  his life in Madison Co., Alabama.—“The dwellings of the slaves are\r\n  log huts, from ten to twelve feet square, often without windows,\r\n  doors or floors; they have neither chairs, table, or bedstead.”\r\n\r\n  Reuben L. Macy, of Hudson, N. Y., a member of the religious society\r\n  of Friends. He lived in South Carolina in 1818–19.—“The houses for\r\n  the field-slaves were about fourteen feet square, built in the\r\n  coarsest manner, with one room, _without any chimney or flooring,\r\n  with a hole in the roof to let the smoke out_.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Lemuel Sapington, of Lancaster, Pa., a native of Maryland,\r\n  formerly a slave-holder.—“The descriptions generally given of negro\r\n  quarters are correct; the quarters are _without floors, and not\r\n  sufficient to keep off the inclemency of the weather_; they are\r\n  uncomfortable both in summer and winter.”\r\n\r\n  Rev. John Rankin, a native of Tennessee.—“When they return to their\r\n  miserable huts at night, they find not there the means of\r\n  comfortable rest; but _on the cold ground they must lie without\r\n  covering, and shiver while they slumber_.”\r\n\r\n  Philemon Bliss, Esq., Elyria, Ohio, who lived in Florida in\r\n  1835.—“The dwellings of the slaves are usually small _open_ log\r\n  huts, with but one apartment, and very generally _without floors_.”\r\n\r\n                                            _Slavery as It Is_, p. 43.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. C. C. Jones, to whom we have already alluded, when taking a\r\nsurvey of the condition of the negroes considered as a field for\r\nmissionary effort, takes into account all the conditions of their\r\nexternal life. He speaks of a part of Georgia where as much attention\r\nhad been paid to the comfort of the negro as in any part of the United\r\nStates. He gives the following picture:\r\n\r\n  Their _general mode of living_ is coarse and vulgar. Many negro\r\n  houses are small, low to the ground, blackened with smoke, often\r\n  with dirt floors, and the furniture of the plainest kind. On some\r\n  estates the houses are framed, weather-boarded, neatly white-washed,\r\n  and made sufficiently large and comfortable in every respect. The\r\n  improvement in the size, material and finish, of negro houses, is\r\n  extending. Occasionally they may be found constructed of tabby or\r\n  brick.\r\n\r\n                       _Religious Instruction of the Negroes_, p. 116.\r\n\r\nNow, admitting what Mr. Jones says, to wit, that improvements with\r\nregard to the accommodation of the negroes are continually making among\r\nenlightened and Christian people, still, if we take into account how\r\nmany people there are who are neither enlightened nor Christian, how\r\nunproductive of any benefit to the master all these improvements are,\r\nand how entirely, therefore, they must be the result either of native\r\ngenerosity or of Christian sentiment, the reader may fairly conclude\r\nthat such improvements are the exception, rather than the rule.\r\n\r\nA friend of the writer, travelling in Georgia during the last month,\r\nthus writes:\r\n\r\n  Upon the long line of rice and cotton plantations extending along\r\n  the railroad from Savannah to this city, the negro quarters contain\r\n  scarcely a single hut which a Northern farmer would deem fit shelter\r\n  for his cattle. They are all built of poles, with the ends so\r\n  slightly notched that they are almost as open as children’s\r\n  cob-houses (which they very much resemble), without a single glazed\r\n  window, and with only one mud chimney to each cluster of from four\r\n  to eight cabins. And yet our fellow-travellers were quietly\r\n  expatiating upon the negro’s strange inability to endure cold\r\n  weather!\r\n\r\nLet this modern picture be compared with the account given by the Rev.\r\nHorace Moulton, who spent five years in Georgia between 1817 and 1824,\r\nand it will be seen, in that state at least, there is some resemblance\r\nbetween the more remote and more recent\r\n\r\n  The huts of the slaves are mostly of the poorest kind. They are not\r\n  as good as those temporary shanties which are thrown up beside\r\n  railroads. They are erected with posts and crotches, with but little\r\n  or no frame-work about them. They have no stoves or chimneys; some\r\n  of them have something like a fireplace at one end, and a board or\r\n  two off at that side, or on the roof, to let off the smoke. Others\r\n  have nothing like a fireplace in them; in these the fire is\r\n  sometimes made in the middle of the hut. These buildings have but\r\n  one apartment in them; the places where they pass in and out serve\r\n  both for doors and windows; the sides and roofs are covered with\r\n  coarse, and in many instances with refuse boards. In warm weather,\r\n  especially in the spring, the slaves keep up a smoke, or fire and\r\n  smoke, all night, to drive away the gnats and mosquitos, which are\r\n  very troublesome in all the low country of the South; so much so\r\n  that the whites sleep under frames with nets over them, knit so fine\r\n  that the mosquitos cannot fly through them.\r\n\r\n                                            _Slavery as It Is_, p. 19.\r\n\r\nThe same Mr. Moulton gives the following account of the food of the\r\nslaves, and the mode of procedure on the plantation on which he was\r\nengaged. It may be here mentioned that at the time he was at the South\r\nhe was engaged in certain business relations which caused him frequently\r\nto visit different plantations, and to have under his control many of\r\nthe slaves. His opportunities for observation, therefore, were quite\r\nintimate. There is a homely matter-of-fact distinctness in the style\r\nthat forbids the idea of its being a fancy sketch:\r\n\r\n  It was a general custom, wherever I have been, for the master to\r\n  give each of his slaves, male and female, _one peck of corn per\r\n  week_ for their food. This, at fifty cents per bushel, which was all\r\n  that it was worth when I was there, would amount to twelve and a\r\n  half cents per week for board per head.\r\n\r\n  It cost me, upon an average, when at the South, one dollar per day\r\n  for board;—the price of fourteen bushels of corn per week. This\r\n  would make my board equal in amount to the board of _forty-six\r\n  slaves_! This is all that good or bad masters allow their slaves,\r\n  round about Savannah, on the plantations. One peck of gourd-seed\r\n  corn is to be measured out to each slave once every week. One man\r\n  with whom I labored, however, being desirous to get all the work out\r\n  of his hands he could, before I left (about fifty in number), bought\r\n  for them every week, or twice a week, a beef’s head from market.\r\n  With this they made a soup in a large iron kettle, around which the\r\n  hands came at meal-time, and dipping out the soup, would mix it with\r\n  their hominy, and eat it as though it were a feast. This man\r\n  permitted his slaves to eat twice a day while I was doing a job for\r\n  him. He promised me a beaver hat, and as good a suit of clothes as\r\n  could be bought in the city, if I would accomplish so much for him\r\n  before I returned to the North; giving me the entire control over\r\n  his slaves. Thus you may see the temptations overseers sometimes\r\n  have, to get all the work they can out of the poor slaves. The above\r\n  is an exception to the general rule of feeding. For, in all other\r\n  places where I worked and visited, the slaves had _nothing from\r\n  their masters but the corn_, or its equivalent in potatoes or rice;\r\n  and to this they were not permitted to come but _once a day_. The\r\n  custom was to blow the horn early in the morning, as a signal for\r\n  the hands to rise and go to work. When commenced, they continue work\r\n  until about eleven o’clock A. M., when, at the signal, all hands\r\n  left off, and went into their huts, made their fires, made their\r\n  corn-meal into hominy or cake, ate it, and went to work again at the\r\n  signal of the horn, and worked until night, or until their tasks\r\n  were done. Some cooked their breakfast in the field while at work.\r\n  Each slave must grind his own corn in a hand-mill after he has done\r\n  his work at night. There is generally one hand-mill on every\r\n  plantation for the use of the slaves.\r\n\r\n  Some of the planters have no corn; others often get out. The\r\n  substitute for it is the equivalent of one peck of corn, either in\r\n  rice or sweet potatoes, neither of which is as good for the slaves\r\n  as corn. They complain more of being faint when fed on rice or\r\n  potatoes than when fed on corn. I was with one man a few weeks who\r\n  gave me his hands to do a job of work, and, to save time, one cooked\r\n  for all the rest. The following course was taken:—Two crotched\r\n  sticks were driven down at one end of the yard, and, a small pole\r\n  being laid on the crotches, they swung a large iron kettle on the\r\n  middle of the pole; then made up a fire under the kettle, and boiled\r\n  the hominy; when ready, the hands were called around this kettle\r\n  with their wooden plates and spoons. They dipped out and ate\r\n  standing around the kettle, or sitting upon the ground, as best\r\n  suited their convenience. When they had potatoes, they took them out\r\n  with their hands, and ate them.\r\n\r\n                                            _Slavery as It Is_, p. 18.\r\n\r\nThomas Clay, Esq., a slave-holder of Georgia, and a most benevolent man,\r\nand who interested himself very successfully in endeavoring to promote\r\nthe improvement of the negroes, in his address before the Georgia\r\nPresbytery, 1833, says of their food, “The quantity allowed by custom is\r\na _peck of corn a week_.”\r\n\r\nThe _Maryland Journal and Baltimore Advertiser_, May 30, 1788, says, “A\r\nsingle peck of corn, or the same measure of rice, is the ordinary\r\nprovision for a hard-working slave, to which a small quantity of meat is\r\noccasionally, though rarely, added.”\r\n\r\nCaptain William Ladd, of Minot, Maine, formerly a slave-holder in\r\nFlorida, says, “The usual allowance of food was a quart of corn a day to\r\na full-task hand, with a modicum of salt; _kind_ masters allowed a peck\r\nof corn a week.”\r\n\r\nThe law of North Carolina provides that the master shall give his slave\r\na quart of corn a day, which is less than a peck a week by one\r\nquart.—_Haywood’s Manual_, 525; _Slavery as It Is_, p. 29. The master,\r\ntherefore, who gave a peck a week would feel that he was going beyond\r\nthe law, and giving a quart for generosity.\r\n\r\nThis condition of things will appear far more probable in the section of\r\ncountry where the scene of the story is laid. It is in the south-western\r\nstates, where no provision is _raised_ on the plantations, but the\r\nsupply for the slaves is all purchased from the more northern states.\r\n\r\nLet the reader now imagine the various temptations which might\r\noccur to retrench the allowance of the slaves, under these\r\ncircumstances;—scarcity of money, financial embarrassment, high\r\nprice of provisions, and various causes of the kind, bring a great\r\ninfluence upon the master or overseer.\r\n\r\nAt the time when it was discussed whether the State of Missouri should\r\nbe admitted as a slave state, the measure, like all measures for the\r\nadvancement of this horrible system, was advocated on the good old plea\r\nof humanity to the negroes; thus Mr. Alexander Smyth, in his speech on\r\nthe slavery question, Jan. 21, 1820, says:\r\n\r\n  By confining the slaves to the Southern States, where crops are\r\n  raised for exportation, and bread and meat are purchased, you _doom\r\n  them to scarcity and hunger_. It is proposed to hem in the blacks\r\n  where they are ILL FED.\r\n\r\n                                            _Slavery as It Is_, p. 28.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple recognition of the state of things we have adverted to.\r\nTo the same purport, Mr. Asa A. Stone, a theological student, who\r\nresided near Natchez, Miss., in 1834–5, says:\r\n\r\n  On almost every plantation, the hands suffer more or less from\r\n  hunger at some seasons of almost every year. There is always a _good\r\n  deal of suffering_ from hunger. On many plantations, and\r\n  particularly in Louisiana, the slaves are in a condition of _almost\r\n  utter famishment_, during a great portion of the year.—_Ibid._\r\n\r\nMr. Tobias Baudinot, St. Albans, Ohio, a member of the Methodist Church,\r\nwho for some years was a navigator on the Mississippi, says:\r\n\r\n  The slaves down the Mississippi are _half-starved_. The boats, when\r\n  they stop at night, are constantly boarded by slaves, begging for\r\n  something to eat.\r\n\r\n                                                               _Ibid._\r\n\r\nOn the whole, while it is freely and cheerfully admitted that many\r\nindividuals have made most commendable advances in regard to the\r\nprovision for the physical comfort of the slave, still it is to be\r\nfeared that the picture of the accommodations on Legree’s plantation has\r\nas yet too many counterparts. Lest, however, the author should be\r\nsuspected of keeping back anything which might serve to throw light on\r\nthe subject, she will insert in full the following incidents on the\r\nother side, from the pen of the accomplished Professor Ingraham. How far\r\nthese may be regarded as exceptional cases, or as pictures of the\r\ngeneral mode of providing for slaves, may safely be left to the good\r\nsense of the reader. The professor’s anecdotes are as follows:\r\n\r\n  “What can you do with so much tobacco?” said a gentleman,—who\r\n  related the circumstance to me,—on hearing a planter, whom he was\r\n  visiting, give an order to his teamster to bring two hogsheads of\r\n  tobacco out to the estate from the “Landing.”\r\n\r\n  “I purchase it for my negroes; it is a harmless indulgence, which it\r\n  gives me pleasure to afford them.”\r\n\r\n  “Why are you at the trouble and expense of having high-post\r\n  bedsteads for your negroes?” said a gentleman from the North, while\r\n  walking through the handsome “quarters,” or village, for the slaves,\r\n  then in progress on a plantation near Natchez—addressing the\r\n  proprietor.\r\n\r\n  “To suspend their ‘bars’ from, that they may not be troubled with\r\n  mosquitos.”\r\n\r\n  “Master, me would like, if you please, a little bit gallery front my\r\n  house.”\r\n\r\n  “For what, Peter?”\r\n\r\n  “‘Cause, master, the sun too hot [an odd reason for a negro to give]\r\n  that side, and when he rain we no able to keep de door open.”\r\n\r\n  “Well, well, when a carpenter gets a little leisure, you shall have\r\n  one.”\r\n\r\n  A few weeks after, I was at the plantation, and riding past the\r\n  quarters one Sabbath morning, beheld Peter, his wife and children,\r\n  with his old father, all sunning themselves in the new gallery.\r\n\r\n  “Missus, you promise me a Chrismus gif’.”\r\n\r\n  “Well, Jane, there is a new calico frock for you.”\r\n\r\n  “It werry pretty, Missus,” said Jane, eying it at a distance without\r\n  touching it, “but me prefer muslin, if you please: muslin de fashion\r\n  dis Chrismus.”\r\n\r\n  “Very well, Jane, call to-morrow, and you shall have a muslin.”\r\n\r\nThe writer would not think of controverting the truth of these\r\nanecdotes. Any probable amount of high-post bedsteads and mosquito\r\n“bars,” of tobacco distributed as gratuity, and verandas constructed by\r\nleisurely carpenters for the sunning of fastidious negroes, may be\r\nconceded, and they do in no whit impair the truth of the other facts.\r\nWhen the reader remembers that the “gang” of some opulent owners amounts\r\nto from five to seven hundred working hands, besides children, he can\r\njudge how extensively these accommodations are likely to be provided.\r\nLet them be safely thrown into the account, for what they are worth.\r\n\r\nAt all events, it is pleasing to end off so disagreeable a chapter with\r\nsome more agreeable images.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                   SELECT INCIDENTS OF LAWFUL TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter of _Uncle Tom’s Cabin_ were recorded some of the most\r\nhighly-wrought and touching incidents of the slave-trade. It will be\r\nwell to authenticate a few of them.\r\n\r\nOne of the first sketches presented to view is an account of the\r\nseparation of a very old, decrepit negro woman from her young son, by a\r\nsheriff’s sale. The writer is sorry to say that not the slightest credit\r\nfor invention is due to her in this incident. She found it, almost\r\nexactly as it stands, in the published journal of a young Southerner,\r\nrelated as a scene to which he was eye-witness. The only circumstance\r\nwhich she has omitted in the narrative was one of additional inhumanity\r\nand painfulness which he had delineated. He represents the boy as being\r\nbought by a planter, who fettered his hands, and tied a rope round his\r\nneck which he attached to the neck of his horse, thus compelling the\r\nchild to trot by his side. This incident alone was suppressed by the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nAnother scene of fraud and cruelty, in the same chapter, is described as\r\nperpetrated by a Kentucky slave-master, who sells a woman to a trader,\r\nand induces her to go with him by the deceitful assertion that she is to\r\nbe taken down the river a short distance, to work at the same hotel with\r\nher husband. This was an instance which occurred under the writer’s own\r\nobservation, some years since, when she was going down the Ohio river.\r\nThe woman was very respectable both in appearance and dress. The writer\r\nrecalls her image now with distinctness, attired with great neatness in\r\na white wrapper, her clothing and hair all arranged with evident care,\r\nand having with her a prettily-dressed boy about seven years of age. She\r\nhad also a hair trunk of clothing, which showed that she had been\r\ncarefully and respectably brought up. It will be seen, in perusing the\r\naccount, that the incident is somewhat altered to suit the purpose of\r\nthe story, the woman being there represented as carrying with her a\r\nyoung infant.\r\n\r\nThe custom of unceremoniously separating the infant from its mother,\r\nwhen the latter is about to be taken from a Northern to a Southern\r\nmarket, is a matter of every-day notoriety in the trade. It is not done\r\noccasionally and sometimes, but always, whenever there is occasion for\r\nit; and the mother’s agonies are no more regarded than those of a cow\r\nwhen her calf is separated from her.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this is, that the care and raising of children is no part\r\nof the intention or provision of a Southern plantation. They are a\r\ntrouble; they detract from the value of the mother as a field-hand, and\r\nit is more expensive to raise them than to buy them ready raised; they\r\nare therefore left behind in the making up of a coffle. Not longer ago\r\nthan last summer, the writer was conversing with Thomas Strother, a\r\nslave minister of the gospel in St. Louis, for whose emancipation she\r\nwas making some effort. He incidentally mentioned to her a scene which\r\nhe had witnessed but a short time before, in which a young woman of his\r\nacquaintance came to him almost in a state of distraction, telling him\r\nthat she had been sold to go South with a trader, and leave behind her a\r\nnursing infant.\r\n\r\nIn Lewis Clark’s narrative he mentions that a master in his neighborhood\r\nsold a woman and child to a trader, with the charge that he should not\r\nsell the child from its mother. The man, however, traded off the child\r\nin the very next town, in payment of his tavern-bill.\r\n\r\nThe following testimony is from a gentleman who writes from New Orleans\r\nto the _National Era_.\r\n\r\nThis writer says:\r\n\r\n  While at Robinson, or Tyree Springs, twenty miles from Nashville, on\r\n  the borders of Kentucky and Tennessee, my hostess said to me, one\r\n  day, “Yonder comes a gang of slaves, chained.” I went to the\r\n  road-side and viewed them. For the better answering my purpose of\r\n  observation, I stopped the white man in front, who was at his ease\r\n  in a one-horse wagon, and asked him if those slaves were for sale. I\r\n  counted them and observed their position. They were divided by three\r\n  one-horse wagons, each containing a man-merchant, so arranged as to\r\n  command the whole gang. Some were unchained; sixty were chained in\r\n  two companies, thirty in each, the right hand of one to the left\r\n  hand of the other opposite one, making fifteen each side of a large\r\n  ox-chain, to which every hand was fastened, and necessarily\r\n  compelled to hold up,—men and women promiscuously, and about in\r\n  equal proportions,—all young people. No children here, except a few\r\n  in a wagon behind, which were the only children in the four gangs. I\r\n  said to a respectable mulatto woman in the house, “Is it true that\r\n  the negro-traders take mothers from their babies?” “Massa, it is\r\n  true; for here, last week, such a girl [naming her], who lives about\r\n  a mile off, was taken after dinner,—knew nothing of it in the\r\n  morning,—sold, put into the gang, and her baby given away to a\r\n  neighbor. She was a stout young woman, and brought a good price.”\r\n\r\nNor is the pitiful lie to be regarded which says that these unhappy\r\nmothers and fathers, husbands and wives, do not feel when the most\r\nsacred ties are thus severed. Every day and hour bears living witness of\r\nthe falsehood of this slander, the more false because spoken of a race\r\npeculiarly affectionate, and strong, vivacious and vehement, in the\r\nexpression of their feelings.\r\n\r\nThe case which the writer supposed of the woman’s throwing herself\r\noverboard is not by any means a singular one. Witness the following\r\nrecent fact, which appeared under the head of\r\n\r\n               ANOTHER INCIDENT FOR “UNCLE TOM’S CABIN.”\r\n\r\n  The editorial correspondent of the _Oneida_ (N. Y.) _Telegraph_,\r\n  writing from a steamer on the Mississippi river, gives the following\r\n  sad story:\r\n\r\n  “At Louisville, a gentleman took passage, having with him a family\r\n  of blacks,—husband, wife and children. The master was bound for\r\n  Memphis, Tenn., at which place he intended to take all except the\r\n  man ashore. The latter was handcuffed, and although his master said\r\n  nothing of his intention, the negro made up his mind, from\r\n  appearances, as well as from the remarks of those around him, that\r\n  he was destined for the _Southern market_. We reached Memphis during\r\n  the night, and whilst within sight of the town, just before landing,\r\n  the negro caused his wife to divide their things, as though resigned\r\n  to the intended separation, and then, taking a moment when his\r\n  master’s back was turned, ran forward and jumped into the river. Of\r\n  course he sank, and his master was several hundred dollars poorer\r\n  than a moment before. That was all; at least, scarcely any one\r\n  mentioned it the next morning. I was obliged to get my information\r\n  from the deck hands, and did not hear a remark concerning it in the\r\n  cabin. In justice to the master, I should say, that after the\r\n  occurrence he disclaimed any intention to separate them.\r\n  Appearances, however, are quite against him, if I have been rightly\r\n  informed. This sad affair needs no comment. It is an argument,\r\n  however, that I might have used to-day, with some effect, whilst\r\n  talking with a highly-intelligent Southerner of the evils of\r\n  slavery. He had been reading _Uncle Tom’s Cabin_, and spoke of it as\r\n  a _novel_, which, like other romances, was well calculated to excite\r\n  the sympathies, by the recital of heart-touching incidents which\r\n  _never had an existence_, except in the imagination of the writer.”\r\n\r\nInstances have occurred where mothers, whose children were about to be\r\nsold from them, have, in their desperation, murdered their own\r\noffspring, to save them from this worst kind of orphanage. A case of\r\nthis kind has been recently tried in the United States, and was alluded\r\nto, a week or two ago, by Mr. Giddings, in his speech on the floor of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nAn American gentleman from Italy, complaining of the effect of “Uncle\r\nTom’s Cabin” on the Italian mind, states that images of fathers dragged\r\nfrom their families to be sold into slavery, and of babes torn from the\r\nbreasts of weeping mothers, are constantly presented before the minds of\r\nthe people as scenes of every-day life in America. The author can only\r\nsay, sorrowfully, that it is _only the truth_ which is thus presented.\r\n\r\nThese things _are_, every day, part and parcel of one of _the most\r\nthriving trades that is carried on in America_. The only difference\r\nbetween us and foreign nations is, that we have got used to it, and they\r\nhave not. The thing has been done, and done again, day after day, and\r\nyear after year, reported and lamented over in every variety of way; but\r\nit is _going on this day_ with more briskness than ever before, and such\r\nscenes as we have described are enacted oftener, as the author will\r\nprove when she comes to the chapter on the internal slave-trade.\r\n\r\nThe incident in this same chapter which describes the scene where the\r\nwife of the unfortunate article, catalogued as “John aged 30,” rushed on\r\nboard the boat and threw her arms around him, with moans and\r\nlamentations, was a real incident. The gentleman who related it was so\r\nstirred in his spirit at the sight, that he addressed the trader in the\r\nexact words which the writer represents the young minister as having\r\nused in her narrative.\r\n\r\n  My friend, how can you, how dare you, carry on a trade like this?\r\n  Look at those poor creatures! Here I am, rejoicing in my heart that\r\n  I am going home to my wife and child; and the same bell which is the\r\n  signal to carry me onward towards them will part this poor man and\r\n  his wife forever. Depend upon it, God will bring you into judgment\r\n  for this.\r\n\r\nIf that gentleman has read the work,—as perhaps he has before now,—he\r\nhas probably recognized his own words. One affecting incident in the\r\nnarrative, as it really occurred, ought to be mentioned. The wife was\r\npassionately bemoaning her husband’s fate, as about to be forever\r\nseparated from all that he held dear, to be sold to the hard usage of a\r\nSouthern plantation. The husband, in reply, used that very simple but\r\nsublime expression which the writer has placed in the mouth of Uncle\r\nTom, in similar circumstances: “_There’ll be the same God there that\r\nthere is here._”\r\n\r\nOne other incident mentioned in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” may, perhaps, be as\r\nwell verified in this place as in any other.\r\n\r\nThe case of old Prue was related by a brother and sister of the writer,\r\nas follows: She was the woman who supplied _rusks_ and other articles of\r\nthe kind at the house where they boarded. Her manners, appearance and\r\ncharacter, were just as described. One day another servant came in her\r\nplace, bringing the rusks. The sister of the writer inquired what had\r\nbecome of _Prue_. She seemed reluctant to answer for some time, but at\r\nlast said that they had taken her into the cellar and beaten her, and\r\nthat the flies had got at her, and she was dead!\r\n\r\nIt is well known that there are no _cellars_, properly so called, in New\r\nOrleans, the nature of the ground being such as to forbid digging. The\r\nslave who used the word had probably been imported from some state where\r\ncellars were in use, and applied the term to the place which was used\r\nfor the ordinary purposes of a cellar. A cook who lived in the writer’s\r\nfamily, having lived most of her life on a plantation, always applied\r\nthe descriptive terms of the plantation to the very limited enclosures\r\nand retinue of a very plain house and yard.\r\n\r\nThis same lady, while living in the same place, used frequently to have\r\nher compassion excited by hearing the wailings of a sickly baby in a\r\nhouse adjoining their own, as also the objurgations and tyrannical abuse\r\nof a ferocious virago upon its mother. She once got an opportunity to\r\nspeak to its mother, who appeared heart-broken and dejected, and\r\ninquired what was the matter with her child. Her answer was that she had\r\nhad a fever, and that her milk was all dried away; and that her mistress\r\nwas set against her child, and would not buy milk for it. She had tried\r\nto feed it on her own coarse food, but it pined and cried continually;\r\nand in witness of this she brought the baby to her. It was emaciated to\r\na skeleton. The lady took the little thing to a friend of hers in the\r\nhouse who had been recently confined, and who was suffering from a\r\nredundancy of milk, and begged her to nurse it. The miserable sight of\r\nthe little, famished, wasted thing affected the mother so as to overcome\r\nall other considerations, and she placed it to her breast, when it\r\nrevived, and took food with an eagerness which showed how much it had\r\nsuffered. But the child was so reduced that this proved only a transient\r\nalleviation. It was after this almost impossible to get sight of the\r\nwoman, and the violent temper of her mistress was such as to make it\r\ndifficult to interfere in the case. The lady secretly afforded what aid\r\nshe could, though, as she confessed, with a sort of misgiving that it\r\nwas a cruelty to try to hold back the poor little sufferer from the\r\nrefuge of the grave; and it was a relief to her when at last its\r\nwailings ceased, and it went where the weary are at rest. This is one of\r\nthose cases which go to show that the _interest_ of the owner will not\r\nalways insure kind treatment of the slave.\r\n\r\nThere is one other incident, which the writer interwove into the history\r\nof the mulatto woman who was bought by Legree for his plantation. The\r\nreader will remember that, in telling her story to Emmeline, she says:\r\n\r\n  “My Mas’r was Mr. Ellis,—lived on Levee-street. P’raps you’ve seen\r\n  the house.”\r\n\r\n  “Was he good to you?” said Emmeline.\r\n\r\n  “Mostly, till he tuk sick. He’s lain sick, off and on, more than six\r\n  months, and been orful oneasy. ‘Pears like he warn’t willin’ to have\r\n  nobody rest, day nor night; and got so cur’ous, there couldn’t\r\n  nobody suit him. ‘Pears like he just grew crosser every day; kep me\r\n  up nights till I got fairly beat out, and couldn’t keep awake no\r\n  longer; and ‘cause I got to sleep one night, Lors! he talk so orful\r\n  to me, and he tell me he’d sell me to just the hardest master he\r\n  could find; and he’d promised me my freedom, too, when he died.”\r\n\r\nAn incident of this sort came under the author’s observation in the\r\nfollowing manner: A quadroon slave family, liberated by the will of the\r\nmaster, settled on Walnut Hills, near her residence, and their children\r\nwere received into her family school, taught in her house. In this\r\nfamily was a little quadroon boy, four or five years of age, with a sad,\r\ndejected appearance, who excited their interest.\r\n\r\nThe history of this child, as narrated by his friends, was simply this:\r\nHis mother had been the indefatigable nurse of her master, during a\r\nlingering and painful sickness, which at last terminated his life. She\r\nhad borne all the fatigue of the nursing, both by night and by day,\r\nsustained in it by his promise that she should be rewarded for it by her\r\nliberty, at his death. Overcome by exhaustion and fatigue, she one night\r\nfell asleep, and he was unable to rouse her. The next day, after\r\nviolently upbraiding her, he altered the directions of his will, and\r\nsold her to a man who was noted in all the region round as a cruel\r\nmaster, which sale, immediately on his death, which was shortly after,\r\ntook effect. The only mitigation of her sentence was that her child was\r\nnot to be taken with her into this dreaded lot, but was given to this\r\nquadroon family to be brought into a free state.\r\n\r\nThe writer very well remembers hearing this story narrated among a group\r\nof liberated negroes, and their comments on it. A peculiar form of grave\r\nand solemn irony often characterizes the communications of this class of\r\npeople. It is a habit engendered in slavery to comment upon proceedings\r\nof this kind in language apparently respectful to the perpetrators, and\r\nwhich is felt to be irony only by a certain peculiarity of manner,\r\ndifficult to describe. After the relation of this story, when the writer\r\nexpressed her indignation in no measured terms, one of the oldest of the\r\nsable circle remarked, gravely,\r\n\r\n“The man was a mighty great Christian, anyhow.”\r\n\r\nThe writer warmly expressed her dissent from this view, when another of\r\nthe same circle added,\r\n\r\n“Went to glory, anyhow.”\r\n\r\nAnd another continued,\r\n\r\n“Had the greatest kind of a time when he was a-dyin’; said he was goin’\r\nstraight into heaven.”\r\n\r\nAnd when the writer remarked that many people thought so who never got\r\nthere, a singular smile of grim approval passed round the circle, but no\r\nfurther comments were made. This incident has often recurred to the\r\nwriter’s mind, as showing the danger to the welfare of the master’s soul\r\nfrom the possession of absolute power. A man of justice and humanity\r\nwhen in health, is often tempted to become unjust, exacting and\r\nexorbitant, in sickness. If, in these circumstances, he is surrounded by\r\ninferiors, from whom law and public opinion have taken away the rights\r\nof common humanity, how is he tempted to the exercise of the most\r\ndespotic passions, and, like this unfortunate man, to leave the world\r\nwith the weight of these awful words upon his head: “If ye forgive not\r\nmen their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n                                 TOPSY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTopsy stands as the representative of a large class of the children who\r\nare growing up under the institution of slavery,—quick, active, subtle\r\nand ingenious, apparently utterly devoid of principle and conscience,\r\nkeenly penetrating, by an instinct which exists in the childish mind,\r\nthe degradation of their condition, and the utter hopelessness of rising\r\nabove it; feeling the black skin on them, like the mark of Cain, to be a\r\nsign of reprobation and infamy, and urged on by a kind of secret\r\ndesperation to make their “calling and election” in sin “sure.”\r\n\r\nChristian people have often been perfectly astonished and discouraged,\r\nas Miss Ophelia was, in the attempt to bring up such children decently\r\nand Christianly, under a state of things which takes away every\r\nstimulant which God meant should operate healthfully on the human mind.\r\n\r\nWe are not now speaking of the Southern States merely, but of the New\r\nEngland States; for, startling as it may appear, _slavery is not yet\r\nwholly abolished in the free states of the North_. The most unchristian\r\npart of it, that which gives to it all the bitterness and all the sting,\r\nis yet, in a great measure, unrepealed; it is the practical denial to\r\nthe negro of the rights of human brotherhood. In consequence of this,\r\nTopsy is a character which may be found at the North as well as at the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the education of negro, mulatto and quadroon children, the\r\nwriter has often observed this fact:—that, for a certain time, and up to\r\na certain age, they kept equal pace with, and were often superior to,\r\nthe white children with whom they were associated; but that there came a\r\ntime when they became indifferent to learning, and made no further\r\nprogress. This was invariably at the age when they were old enough to\r\nreflect upon life, and to perceive that society had no place to offer\r\nthem for which anything more would be requisite than the rudest and most\r\nelementary knowledge.\r\n\r\nLet us consider how it is with our own children; how few of them would\r\never acquire an education from the mere love of learning.\r\n\r\nIn the process necessary to acquire a handsome style of hand-writing, to\r\nmaster the intricacies of any language, or to conquer the difficulties\r\nof mathematical study, how often does the perseverance of the child\r\nflag, and need to be stimulated by his parents and teachers by such\r\nconsiderations as these: “It will be necessary for you, in such or such\r\na position in life, to possess this or that acquirement or\r\naccomplishment. How could you ever become a merchant, without\r\nunderstanding accounts? How could you enter the learned professions,\r\nwithout understanding languages? If you are ignorant and uninformed, you\r\ncannot take rank as a gentleman in society.”\r\n\r\nDoes not every one know that, without the stimulus which teachers and\r\nparents thus continually present, multitudes of children would never\r\ngain a tolerable education? And is it not the absence of all such\r\nstimulus which has prevented the negro child from an equal advance?\r\n\r\nIt is often objected to the negro race that they are frivolous and vain,\r\npassionately fond of show, and are interested only in trifles. And who\r\nis to blame for all this? Take away all high aims, all noble ambition,\r\nfrom any class, and what is left for them to be interested in _but_\r\ntrifles?\r\n\r\nThe present attorney-general of Liberia, Mr. Lewis, is a man who\r\ncommands the highest respect, for talent and ability in his position;\r\nyet, while he was in America, it is said that, like many other young\r\ncolored men, he was distinguished only for foppery and frivolity. What\r\nmade the change in Lewis after he went to Liberia? Who does not see the\r\nanswer? Does any one wish to know what is inscribed on the seal which\r\nkeeps the great stone over the sepulchre of African mind? It is\r\nthis;—which was so truly said by poor Topsy,—“NOTHING BUT A NIGGER!”\r\n\r\nIt is this, burnt into the soul by the branding-iron of cruel and\r\nunchristian scorn, that is a sorer and deeper wound than all the\r\nphysical evils of slavery together.\r\n\r\nThere never was a slave who did not feel it. Deep, deep down in the\r\ndark, still waters of his soul is the conviction, heavier, bitterer than\r\nall others, that he is _not regarded as a man_. On this point may be\r\nintroduced the testimony of one who has known the wormwood and the gall\r\nof slavery by bitter experience. The following letter has been received\r\nfrom Dr. Pennington, in relation to some inquiries of the author:\r\n\r\n                                     { _50 Laurens-street,_\r\n                                     {      _New York, Nov. 30, 1852._\r\n\r\n  MRS H. B. STOWE.\r\n\r\n  ESTEEMED MADAM: I have duly received your kind letter in answer to\r\n  mine of the 15th instant, in which you state that you “have an\r\n  intense curiosity to know how far you have rightly divined the heart\r\n  of the slave.” You give me your idea in these words: “There lies\r\n  buried down in the heart of the most seemingly careless and stupid\r\n  slave a _bleeding spot_, that bleeds and aches, though he could\r\n  scarcely tell why; and that this sore spot is the _degradation_ of\r\n  his position.”\r\n\r\n  After escaping from the plantation of Dr. Tilghman, in Washington\r\n  County, Md., where I was held as a slave, and worked as a\r\n  blacksmith, I came to the State of Pennsylvania, and, after\r\n  experiencing there some of the vicissitudes referred to in my little\r\n  published narrative, I came into New York State, bringing in my mind\r\n  a certain indescribable feeling of wretchedness. They used to say of\r\n  me at Dr. Tilghman’s, “That blacksmith Jemmy is a ‘cute fellow;\r\n  still water runs deep.” But I confess that “blacksmith Jemmy” was\r\n  not ‘cute enough to understand the cause of his own wretchedness.\r\n  The current of the still water may have run deep, but it did not\r\n  reach down to that awful bed of lava.\r\n\r\n  At times I thought it occasioned by the lurking fear of betrayal.\r\n  There was no Vigilance Committee at the time,—there were but\r\n  anti-slavery men. I came North with my counsels in my own cautious\r\n  breast. I married a wife, and did not tell her I was a fugitive.\r\n  None of my friends knew it. I knew not the means of safety, and\r\n  hence I was constantly in fear of meeting with some one who would\r\n  betray me.\r\n\r\n  It was fully two years before I could hold up my head; but still\r\n  that feeling was in my mind. In 1846, after opening my bosom as a\r\n  fugitive to John Hooker, Esq., I felt this much relief,—“Thank God\r\n  there is one brother-man in hard old Connecticut that knows my\r\n  troubles.”\r\n\r\n  Soon after this, when I sailed to the island of Jamaica, and on\r\n  landing there saw colored men in all the stations of civil, social,\r\n  commercial life, where I had seen white men in this country, that\r\n  feeling of wretchedness experienced a sensible relief, as if some\r\n  feverish sore had been just reached by just the right kind of balm.\r\n  There was before my eye evidence that a colored man is more than “a\r\n  nigger.” I went into the House of Assembly at Spanishtown, where\r\n  fifteen out of forty-five members were colored men. I went into the\r\n  courts, where I saw in the jury-box colored and white men together,\r\n  colored and white lawyers at the bar. I went into the Common Council\r\n  of Kingston; there I found men of different colors. So in all the\r\n  counting-rooms, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n  But still there was this drawback. Somebody says, “This is nothing\r\n  but a nigger island.” Now, then, my old trouble came back again; “a\r\n  nigger among niggers is but a nigger still.”\r\n\r\n  In 1849, when I undertook my second visit to Great Britain, I\r\n  resolved to prolong and extend my travel and intercourse with the\r\n  best class of men, with a view to see if I could banish that\r\n  troublesome old ghost entirely out of my mind. In England, Scotland,\r\n  Wales, France, Germany, Belgium and Prussia, my whole power has been\r\n  concentrated on this object. “I’ll be a man, and I’ll kill off this\r\n  enemy which has haunted me these twenty years and more.” I believe I\r\n  have succeeded in some good degree; at least, I have now no more\r\n  trouble on the score of equal manhood with the whites. My European\r\n  tour was certainly useful, because there the trial was fair and\r\n  honorable. I had nothing to complain of. I got what was due to man,\r\n  and I was expected to do what was due from man to man. I sought not\r\n  to be treated as a pet. I put myself into the harness, and wrought\r\n  manfully in the first pulpits, and the platforms in peace\r\n  congresses, conventions, anniversaries, commencements, &c.; and in\r\n  these exercises that rusty old iron came out of my soul, and went\r\n  “clean away.”\r\n\r\n  You say again you have never seen a slave how ever careless and\r\n  merry-hearted, who had not this sore place, and that did not shrink\r\n  or get angry if a finger was laid on it. I see that you have been a\r\n  close observer of negro nature.\r\n\r\n  So far as I understand your idea, I think you are perfectly correct\r\n  in the impression you have received, as explained in your note.\r\n\r\n  O, Mrs. Stowe, slavery is an awful system! It takes man as God made\r\n  him; it demolishes him, and then mis-creates him, or perhaps I\r\n  should say mal-creates him!\r\n\r\n  Wishing you good health and good success in your arduous work,\r\n\r\n                                          I am yours, respectfully,\r\n                                                  J. W. C. PENNINGTON.\r\n\r\nPeople of intelligence, who have had the care of slaves, have often made\r\nthis remark to the writer: “They are a singular whimsical people; you\r\ncan do a great deal more with them by humoring some of their prejudices,\r\nthan by bestowing on them the most substantial favors.” On inquiring\r\nwhat these prejudices were, the reply would be, “They like to have their\r\nweddings elegantly celebrated, and to have a good deal of notice taken\r\nof their funerals, and to give and go to parties dressed and appearing\r\nlike white people; and they will often put up with material\r\ninconveniences, and suffer themselves to be worked very hard, if they\r\nare humored in these respects.”\r\n\r\nCan any one think of this without compassion? Poor souls! willing to\r\nbear with so much for simply this slight acknowledgment of their common\r\nhumanity. To honor their weddings and funerals is, in some sort,\r\nacknowledging that they are human, and therefore they prize it. Hence we\r\nsee the reason of the passionate attachment which often exists in a\r\nfaithful slave to a good master. It is, in fact, a transfer of his\r\nidentity to his master. A stern law and an unchristian public sentiment\r\nhas taken away his birthright of humanity, erased his name from the\r\ncatalogue of men, and made him an anomalous creature—neither man nor\r\nbrute. When a kind master recognizes his humanity, and treats him as a\r\nhumble companion and a friend, there is no end to the devotion and\r\ngratitude which he thus excites. He is to the slave a deliverer and a\r\nsaviour from the curse which lies on his hapless race. Deprived of all\r\nlegal rights and privileges, all opportunity or hope of personal\r\nadvancement or honor, he transfers, as it were, his whole existence into\r\nhis master’s, and appropriates his rights, his position, his honor, as\r\nhis own; and thus enjoys a kind of reflected sense of what it might be\r\nto be a man himself. Hence it is that the appeal to the more generous\r\npart of the negro character is seldom made in vain.\r\n\r\nAn acquaintance of the writer was married to a gentleman in Louisiana,\r\nwho was the proprietor of some eight hundred slaves. He, of course, had\r\na large train of servants in his domestic establishment. When about to\r\nenter upon her duties, she was warned that the servants were all so\r\nthievish that she would be under the necessity, in common with all other\r\nhousekeepers, of keeping everything under lock and key. She, however,\r\nannounced her intention of training her servants in such a manner as to\r\nmake this unnecessary. Her ideas were ridiculed as chimerical, but she\r\nresolved to carry them into practice. The course she pursued was as\r\nfollows: She called all the family servants together; told them that it\r\nwould be a great burden and restraint upon her to be obliged to keep\r\neverything locked from them; that she had heard that they were not at\r\nall to be trusted, but that she could not help hoping that they were\r\nmuch better than they had been represented. She told them that she\r\nshould provide abundantly for all their wants, and then that she should\r\nleave her stores unlocked, and trust to their honor.\r\n\r\nThe idea that they were supposed capable of having any honor struck a\r\nnew chord at once in every heart. The servants appeared most grateful\r\nfor the trust, and there was much public spirit excited, the older and\r\ngraver ones exerting themselves to watch over the children, that nothing\r\nmight be done to destroy this new-found treasure of honor.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, the lady discovered that some depredations had been\r\nmade on her cake by some of the juvenile part of the establishment; she,\r\ntherefore, convened all the servants and stated the fact to them. She\r\nremarked that it was not on account of the value of the cake that she\r\nfelt annoyed, but that they must be sensible that it would not be\r\npleasant for her to have it indiscriminately fingered and handled, and\r\nthat, therefore, she should set some cake out upon a table, or some\r\nconvenient place, and beg that all those who were disposed to take it\r\nwould go there and help themselves, and allow the rest to remain\r\nundisturbed in the closet. She states that the cake stood upon the table\r\nand dried, without a morsel of it being touched, and that she never\r\nafterwards had any trouble in this respect.\r\n\r\nA little time after, a new carriage was bought, and one night the\r\nleather boot of it was found to be missing. Before her husband had time\r\nto take any steps on the subject, the servants of the family called a\r\nconvention among themselves, and instituted an inquiry into the offence.\r\nThe boot was found and promptly restored, though they would not reveal\r\nto their master and mistress the name of the offender.\r\n\r\nOne other anecdote which this lady related illustrates that peculiar\r\ndevotion of a slave to a good master, to which allusion has been made.\r\nHer husband met with his death by a sudden and melancholy accident. He\r\nhad a personal attendant and confidential servant who had grown up with\r\nhim from childhood. This servant was so overwhelmed with grief as to be\r\nalmost stupefied. On the day of the funeral a brother of his deceased\r\nmaster inquired of him if he had performed a certain commission for his\r\nmistress. The servant said that he had forgotten it. Not perceiving his\r\nfeelings at the moment, the gentleman replied, “I am surprised that you\r\nshould neglect any command of your mistress, when she is in such\r\naffliction.”\r\n\r\nThis remark was the last drop in the full cup. The poor fellow fell to\r\nthe ground entirely insensible, and the family were obliged to spend\r\nnearly two hours employing various means to restore his vitality. The\r\nphysician accounted for his situation by saying that there had been such\r\na rush of all the blood in the body towards the heart, that there was\r\nactual danger of a rupture of that organ,—a literal death by a broken\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nSome thoughts may be suggested by Miss Ophelia’s conscientious but\r\nunsuccessful efforts in the education of Topsy.\r\n\r\nSociety has yet need of a great deal of enlightening as to the means of\r\nrestoring the vicious and degraded to virtue.\r\n\r\nIt has been erroneously supposed that with brutal and degraded natures\r\nonly coarse and brutal measures could avail; and yet it has been found,\r\nby those who have most experience, that their success with this class of\r\nsociety has been just in proportion to the delicacy and kindliness with\r\nwhich they have treated them.\r\n\r\nLord Shaftsbury, who has won so honorable a fame by his benevolent\r\ninterest in the efforts made for the degraded lower classes of his own\r\nland, says, in a recent letter to the author:\r\n\r\n  You are right about Topsy: our ragged schools will afford you many\r\n  instances of poor children, hardened by kicks, insults and neglect,\r\n  moved to tears and docility by the first word of kindness. It opens\r\n  new feelings, develops, as it were, a new nature, and brings the\r\n  wretched outcast into the family of man.\r\n\r\nRecent efforts which have been made among unfortunate females in some of\r\nthe worst districts of New York show the same thing. What is it that\r\nrankles deepest in the breast of fallen woman, that makes her so\r\nhopeless and irreclaimable? It is that burning consciousness of\r\ndegradation which stings worse than cold or hunger, and makes her shrink\r\nfrom the face of the missionary and the philanthropist. They who have\r\nvisited these haunts of despair and wretchedness have learned that they\r\nmust touch gently the shattered harp of the human soul, if they would\r\nstring it again to divine music; that they must encourage self-respect,\r\nand hope, and sense of character, or the bonds of death can never be\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nLet us examine the gospel of Christ, and see on what principles its\r\nappeals are constructed. Of what nature are those motives which have\r\nmelted _our_ hearts and renewed _our_ wills? Are they not appeals to the\r\nmost generous and noble instincts of our nature? Are we not told of One\r\nfairer than the sons of men,—One reigning in immortal glory, who loved\r\nus so that he could bear pain, and want, and shame, and death itself,\r\nfor our sake?\r\n\r\nWhen Christ speaks to the soul, does he crush one of its nobler\r\nfaculties? Does he taunt us with our degradation, our selfishness, our\r\nnarrowness of view, and feebleness of intellect, compared with his own?\r\nIs it not true that he not only saves us from our sins, but saves us in\r\na way most considerate, most tender, most regardful of our feelings and\r\nsufferings? Does not the Bible tell us that, in order to fulfil his\r\noffice of Redeemer the more perfectly, he took upon him the condition of\r\nhumanity, and endured the pains, and wants, and temptations of a mortal\r\nexistence, that he might be to us a sympathizing, appreciating friend,\r\n“touched with the feeling of our infirmities,” and cheering us gently on\r\nin the hard path of returning virtue?\r\n\r\nO, when shall we, who have received so much of Jesus Christ, learn to\r\nrepay it in acts of kindness to our poor brethren? When shall we be\r\nChrist-like, and not man-like, in our efforts to reclaim the fallen and\r\nwandering?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n                              THE QUAKERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer’s sketch of the character of this people has been drawn from\r\npersonal observation. There are several settlements of these people in\r\nOhio, and the manner of living, the tone of sentiment, and the habits of\r\nlife, as represented in her book, are not at all exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThese settlements have always been refuges for the oppressed and\r\noutlawed slave. The character of Rachel Halliday was a real one, but she\r\nhas passed away to her reward. Simeon Halliday, calmly risking fine and\r\nimprisonment for his love to God and man, has had in this country many\r\ncounterparts among the sect.\r\n\r\nThe writer had in mind, at the time of writing, the scenes in the trial\r\nof Thomas Garret, of Wilmington, Delaware, for the crime of hiring a\r\nhack to convey a mother and four children from Newcastle jail to\r\nWilmington, a distance of _five miles_.\r\n\r\nThe writer has received the facts in this case in a letter from John\r\nGarret himself, from which some extracts will be made:\r\n\r\n                                           { _Wilmington, Delaware,_\r\n                                           {   _1st month 18th, 1853._\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\n  HARRIET BEECHER STOWE: I have this day received a request from\r\n  Charles K. Whipple, of Boston, to furnish thee with a statement,\r\n  authentic and circumstantial, of the trouble and losses which have\r\n  been brought upon myself and others of my friends from the aid we\r\n  had rendered to fugitive slaves, in order, if thought of sufficient\r\n  importance, to be published in a work thee is now preparing for the\r\n  press.\r\n\r\n  I will now endeavor to give thee a statement of what John Hunn and\r\n  myself suffered by aiding a family of slaves, a few years since. I\r\n  will give the facts as they occurred, and thee may condense and\r\n  publish so much as thee may think useful in thy work, and no more:\r\n\r\n  “In the 12th month, year 1846, a family, consisting of Samuel\r\n  Hawkins, a freeman, his wife Emeline, and six children, who were\r\n  afterwards _proved slaves_, stopped at the house of a friend named\r\n  John Hunn, near Middletown, in this state, in the evening about\r\n  sunset, to procure food and lodging for the night. They were seen by\r\n  some of Hunn’s pro-slavery neighbors, who soon came with a\r\n  constable, and had them taken before a magistrate. Hunn had left the\r\n  slaves in his kitchen when he went to the village of Middletown,\r\n  half a mile distant. When the officer came with a warrant for them,\r\n  he met Hunn at the kitchen door, and asked for the blacks; Hunn,\r\n  with truth, said he did not know where they were. Hunn’s wife,\r\n  thinking they would be safer, had sent them up stairs during his\r\n  absence, where they were found. Hunn made no resistance, and they\r\n  were taken before the magistrate, and from his office direct to\r\n  Newcastle jail, where they arrived about one o’clock on 7th day\r\n  morning.\r\n\r\n  The sheriff and his daughter, being kind, humane people, inquired of\r\n  Hawkins and wife the facts of their case; and his daughter wrote to\r\n  a lady here, to request me to go to Newcastle and inquire into the\r\n  case, as her father and self really believed they were most of them,\r\n  if not all, entitled to their _freedom_. Next morning I went to\r\n  Newcastle: had the family of colored people brought into the parlor,\r\n  and the sheriff and myself came to the conclusion that the parents\r\n  and four youngest children were by law entitled to their freedom. I\r\n  prevailed on the sheriff to show me the commitment of the\r\n  magistrate, which I found was defective, and not in due form\r\n  according to law. I procured a copy and handed it to a lawyer. He\r\n  pronounced the commitment irregular, and agreed to go next morning\r\n  to Newcastle and have the whole family taken before Judge Booth,\r\n  Chief Justice of the state, by _habeas corpus_, when the following\r\n  admission was made by Samuel Hawkins and wife: They admitted that\r\n  the two eldest boys were held by one Charles Glaudin, of Queen Anne\r\n  County, Maryland, as slaves; that after the birth of these two\r\n  children, Elizabeth Turner, also of Queen Anne, the mistress of\r\n  their mother, had set her free, and permitted her to go and live\r\n  with her husband, near twenty miles from her residence, after which\r\n  the four youngest children were born; that her mistress during all\r\n  that time, eleven or twelve years, had never contributed one dollar\r\n  to their support, or come to see them. After examining the\r\n  commitment in their case, and consulting with my attorney, the judge\r\n  set the whole family at liberty. The day was wet and cold; one of\r\n  the children, three years old, was a cripple from white swelling,\r\n  and could not walk a step; another, eleven months old, at the\r\n  breast; and the parents being desirous of getting to Wilmington,\r\n  five miles distant, I asked the judge if there would be any risk or\r\n  impropriety in my hiring a conveyance for the mother and four young\r\n  children to Wilmington. His reply, in the presence of the sheriff\r\n  and my attorney, was there would not be any. I then requested the\r\n  sheriff to procure a hack to take them over to Wilmington.”\r\n\r\nThe whole family escaped. John Hunn and John Garret were brought up to\r\ntrial for having practically fulfilled these words of Christ which read,\r\n“I was a stranger and ye took me in, I was sick and in prison and ye\r\ncame unto me.” For John Hunn’s part of this crime, he was fined two\r\nthousand five hundred dollars, and John Garret was fined five thousand\r\nfour hundred. Three thousand five hundred of this was the fine for\r\nhiring a hack for them, and one thousand nine hundred was assessed on\r\nhim as the value of the slaves! Our European friends will infer from\r\nthis that it costs something to obey Christ in America, as well as in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nAfter John Garret’s trial was over, and this heavy judgment had been\r\ngiven against him, he calmly rose in the court-room, and requested leave\r\nto address a few words to the court and audience.\r\n\r\nLeave being granted, he spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  I have a few words which I wish to address to the court, jury and\r\n  prosecutors, in the several suits that have been brought against me\r\n  during the sittings of this court, in order to determine the amount\r\n  of penalty I must pay for doing what my feelings prompted me to do\r\n  as a lawful and meritorious act; a simple act of humanity and\r\n  justice, as I believed, to eight of that oppressed race, the people\r\n  of color, whom I found in the Newcastle jail, in the 12th month,\r\n  1845. I will now endeavor to state the facts of those cases, for\r\n  your consideration and reflection after you return home to your\r\n  families and friends. You will then have time to ponder on what has\r\n  transpired here since the sitting of this court, and I believe that\r\n  your verdict will then be unanimous, that the law of the United\r\n  States, as explained by our venerable judge, when compared with the\r\n  act committed by me, was cruel and oppressive, and needs\r\n  remodelling.\r\n\r\nHere follows a very brief and clear statement of the facts in the case,\r\nof which the reader is already apprized.\r\n\r\nAfter showing conclusively that he had no reason to suppose the family\r\nto be slaves, and that they had all been discharged by the judge, he\r\nnobly adds the following words:\r\n\r\n  _Had I believed every one of them to be slaves, I should have done\r\n  the same thing._ I should have done violence to my convictions of\r\n  duty, had I not made use of all the lawful means in my power to\r\n  liberate those people, and assist them to become men and women,\r\n  rather than leave them in the condition of chattels personal.\r\n\r\n  I am called an Abolitionist; once a name of reproach, but one I have\r\n  ever been proud to be considered worthy of being called. For the\r\n  last twenty-five years I have been engaged in the cause of this\r\n  despised and much-injured race, and consider their cause worth\r\n  suffering for; but, owing to a multiplicity of other engagements, I\r\n  could not devote so much of my time and mind to their cause as I\r\n  otherwise should have done.\r\n\r\n  The impositions and persecutions practised on those unoffending and\r\n  innocent brethren are extreme beyond endurance. I am now placed in a\r\n  situation in which I have not so much to claim my attention as\r\n  formerly; and I now pledge myself, in the presence of this assembly,\r\n  to use all lawful and honorable means to lessen the burdens of this\r\n  oppressed people, and endeavor, according to ability furnished, to\r\n  burst their chains asunder, and set them free; not relaxing my\r\n  efforts on their behalf while blessed with health, and a slave\r\n  remains to tread the soil of the state of my adoption,—Delaware.\r\n\r\n  After mature reflection, I can assure this assembly it is my opinion\r\n  at this time that the verdicts you have given the prosecutors\r\n  against John Hunn and myself, within the past few days, will have a\r\n  tendency to raise a spirit of inquiry throughout the length and\r\n  breadth of the land, respecting this monster evil (slavery), in many\r\n  minds that have not heretofore investigated the subject. The reports\r\n  of those trials will be published by editors from Maine to Texas and\r\n  the far West; and what must be the effect produced? It will, no\r\n  doubt, add hundreds, perhaps thousands, to the present large and\r\n  rapidly increasing army of abolitionists. The injury is great to us\r\n  who are the immediate sufferers by your verdict; but I believe the\r\n  verdicts you have given against us within the last few days will\r\n  have a powerful effect in bringing about the abolition of slavery in\r\n  this country, this land of boasted freedom, where not only the slave\r\n  is fettered at the South by his lordly master, but the white man at\r\n  the North is bound as in chains to do the bidding of his Southern\r\n  masters.\r\n\r\nIn his letter to the writer John Garret adds, that after this speech a\r\nyoung man who had served as juryman came across the room, and taking him\r\nby the hand, said:\r\n\r\n“Old gentleman, I believe every statement that you have made. I came\r\nfrom home prejudiced against you, and I now acknowledge that I have\r\nhelped to do you injustice.”\r\n\r\nThus calmly and simply did this Quaker confess Christ before men,\r\naccording as it is written of them of old,—“He esteemed the reproach of\r\nChrist greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt.”\r\n\r\nChrist has said, “Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my words, of him\r\nshall the Son of Man be ashamed.” In our days it is not customary to be\r\nashamed of Christ personally, but of _his words_ many are ashamed. But\r\nwhen they meet Him in judgment they will have cause to remember them;\r\nfor heaven and earth shall pass away, but His word shall not pass away.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother case of the same kind is of a more affecting character.\r\n\r\n_Richard Dillingham_ was the son of a respectable Quaker family in\r\nMorrow County, Ohio. His pious mother brought him up in the full belief\r\nof the doctrine of St. John, that the love of God and the love of man\r\nare inseparable. He was diligently taught in such theological notions as\r\nare implied in such passages as these: “Hereby perceive we the love of\r\nGod, because he laid down his life for us; and we ought also to lay down\r\nour lives for the brethren.—But whoso hath this world’s goods and seeth\r\nhis brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him,\r\nhow dwelleth the love of God in him?—My little children, let us not love\r\nin word and in tongue, but in deed and in truth.”\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these precepts, Richard Dillingham, in early manhood,\r\nwas found in Cincinnati teaching the colored people, and visiting in the\r\nprisons and doing what in him lay to “love in deed and in truth.”\r\n\r\nSome unfortunate families among the colored people had dear friends who\r\nwere slaves in Nashville, Tennessee. Richard was so interested in their\r\nstory, that when he went into Tennessee he was actually taken up and\r\ncaught in the very fact of helping certain poor people to escape to\r\ntheir friends.\r\n\r\nHe was seized and thrown into prison. In the language of this world he\r\nwas imprisoned as a “negro-stealer.” His own account is given in the\r\nfollowing letter to his parents:\r\n\r\n                                _Nashville Jail, 12th mo. 15th, 1849._\r\n\r\n  DEAR PARENTS: I presume you have heard of my arrest and imprisonment\r\n  in the Nashville jail, under a charge of aiding in an attempted\r\n  escape of slaves from the city of Nashville, on the 5th inst. I was\r\n  arrested by M. D. Maddox (district constable), aided by Frederick\r\n  Marshal, watchman at the Nashville Inn, and the bridge-keeper, at\r\n  the bridge across the Cumberland river. When they arrested me, I had\r\n  rode up to the bridge on horseback and paid the toll for myself and\r\n  for the hack to pass over, in which three colored persons, who were\r\n  said to be slaves, were found by the men who arrested me. The driver\r\n  of the hack (who is a free colored man of this city), and the\r\n  persons in the hack, were also arrested; and after being taken to\r\n  the Nashville Inn and searched, we were all taken to jail. My arrest\r\n  took place about eleven o’clock at night.\r\n\r\nIn another letter he says:\r\n\r\n  At the bridge, Maddox said to me, “You are just the man we wanted.\r\n  We will make an example of you.” As soon as we were safe in the\r\n  bar-room of the inn, Maddox took a candle and looked me in the face,\r\n  to see if he could recognize my countenance; and looking intently at\r\n  me a few moments, he said, “Well, you are too good-looking a young\r\n  man to be engaged in such an affair as this.” The bystanders asked\r\n  me several questions, to which I replied that under the present\r\n  circumstances I would rather be excused from answering any questions\r\n  relating to my case; upon which they desisted from further inquiry.\r\n  Some threats and malicious wishes were uttered against me by the\r\n  ruffian part of the assembly, being about twenty-five persons. I was\r\n  put in a cell which had six persons in it, and I can assure thee\r\n  that they were very far from being agreeable companions to me,\r\n  although they were kind. But thou knows that I do not relish cursing\r\n  and swearing, and worst of all loathsome and obscene blasphemy; and\r\n  of such was most of the conversation of my prison mates when I was\r\n  first put in here. The jailers are kind enough to me, but the jail\r\n  is so constructed that it cannot be warmed, and we have to either\r\n  warm ourselves by walking in our cell, which is twelve by fifteen\r\n  feet, or by lying in bed. I went out to my trial on the 16th of last\r\n  month, and put it off till the next term of the court, which will be\r\n  commenced on the second of next 4th month. I put it off on the\r\n  ground of excitement.\r\n\r\n  Dear brother, I have no hopes of getting clear of being convicted\r\n  and sentenced to the penitentiary; but do not think that I am\r\n  without comfort in my afflictions, for I assure thee that I have\r\n  many reflections that give me sweet consolation in the midst of my\r\n  grief. I have a clear conscience before my God, which is my greatest\r\n  comfort and support through all my troubles and afflictions. An\r\n  approving conscience none can know but those who enjoy it. It nerves\r\n  us in the hour of trial to bear our sufferings with fortitude, and\r\n  even with cheerfulness. The greatest affliction I have is the\r\n  reflection of the sorrow and anxiety my friends will have to endure\r\n  on my account. But I can assure thee, brother, that with the\r\n  exception of this reflection, I am far, very far, from being one of\r\n  the most miserable of men. Nay, to the contrary, I am not terrified\r\n  at the prospect before me, though I am grieved about it; but all\r\n  have enough to grieve about in this unfriendly wilderness of sin and\r\n  woe. My hopes are not fixed in this world, and therefore I have a\r\n  source of consolation that will never fail me, so long as I slight\r\n  not the offers of mercy, comfort and peace, which my blessed Saviour\r\n  constantly privileges me with.\r\n\r\n  One source of almost constant annoyance to my feelings is the\r\n  profanity and vulgarity, and the bad, disagreeable temper, of two or\r\n  three fellow-prisoners of my cell. They show me considerable\r\n  kindness and respect; but they cannot do otherwise, when treated\r\n  with the civility and kindness with which I treat them. If it be my\r\n  fate to go to the penitentiary for eight or ten years, I can, I\r\n  believe, meet my doom without shedding a tear. I have not yet shed a\r\n  tear, though there may be many in store. My bail-bonds were set at\r\n  seven thousand dollars. If I should be bailed out, I should return\r\n  to my trial, unless my security were rich, and did not wish me to\r\n  return; for _I am Richard yet_, although I am in the prison of my\r\n  enemy, and will not flinch from what I believe to be right and\r\n  honorable. These are the principles which, in carrying out, have\r\n  lodged me here; for there was a time, at my arrest, that I might\r\n  have, in all probability, escaped the police, but it would have\r\n  subjected those who were arrested with me to punishment, perhaps\r\n  even to death, in order to find out who I was, and if they had not\r\n  told more than they could have done in truth, they would probably\r\n  have been punished without mercy; and I am determined no one shall\r\n  suffer for me. I am now a prisoner, but those who were arrested with\r\n  me are all at liberty, and I believe without whipping. I now stand\r\n  alone before the Commonwealth of Tennessee to answer for the affair.\r\n  Tell my friends I am in the midst of consolation here.\r\n\r\nRichard was engaged to a young lady of amiable disposition and fine\r\nmental endowments.\r\n\r\nTo her he thus writes:\r\n\r\n  O, dearest! Canst thou upbraid me? canst thou call it crime? wouldst\r\n  thou call it crime, or couldst thou upbraid me, for rescuing, or\r\n  attempting to rescue, _thy_ father, mother, or brother and sister,\r\n  or even friends, from a captivity among a cruel race of oppressors?\r\n  O, couldst thou only see what I have seen, and hear what I have\r\n  heard, of the sad, vexatious, degrading, and soul-trying situation\r\n  of as noble minds as ever the Anglo-Saxon race were possessed of,\r\n  mourning in vain for that universal heaven-born boon of freedom,\r\n  which an all-wise and beneficent Creator has designed for all, thou\r\n  couldst not censure, but wouldst deeply sympathize with me! Take all\r\n  these things into consideration, and the thousands of poor mortals\r\n  who are dragging out far more miserable lives than mine will be,\r\n  even at ten years in the penitentiary, and thou wilt not look upon\r\n  my fate with so much horror as thou would at first thought.\r\n\r\nIn another letter he adds:\r\n\r\n  I have happy hours here, and I should not be miserable if I could\r\n  only know you were not sorrowing for me at home. It would give me\r\n  more satisfaction to hear that you were not grieving about me than\r\n  anything else.\r\n\r\n  The nearer I live to the principle of the commandment, “Love thy\r\n  neighbor as thyself,” the more enjoyment I have of this life. None\r\n  can know the enjoyments that flow from feelings of good will towards\r\n  our fellow-beings, both friends and enemies, but those who cultivate\r\n  them. Even in my prison-cell I may be happy, if I will. For the\r\n  Christian’s consolation cannot be shut out from him by enemies or\r\n  iron gates.\r\n\r\nIn another letter to the lady before alluded to he says:\r\n\r\n  By what I am able to learn, I believe thy “Richard” has not fallen\r\n  altogether unlamented; and the satisfaction it gives me is\r\n  sufficient to make my prison life more pleasant and desirable than\r\n  even a life of liberty without the esteem and respect of my friends.\r\n  But it gives bitterness to the cup of my afflictions to think that\r\n  my dear friends and relatives have to suffer such grief and sorrow\r\n  for me.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Though persecution ever so severe be my lot, yet I will not allow my\r\n  indignation ever to ripen into revenge even against my bitterest\r\n  enemies; for there will be a time when all things must be revealed\r\n  before Him who has said “Vengeance is mine, I will repay.” Yes, my\r\n  heart shall ever glow with love for my poor fellow-mortals, who are\r\n  hastening rapidly on to their final destination—the awful tomb and\r\n  the solemn judgment.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps it will give thee some consolation for me to tell thee that\r\n  I believe there is a considerable sympathy existing in the minds of\r\n  some of the better portion of the citizens here, which may be of\r\n  some benefit to me. But all that can be done in my behalf will still\r\n  leave my case a sad one. Think not, however, that it is all loss to\r\n  me, for by my calamity I have learned many good and useful lessons,\r\n  which I hope may yet prove both temporal and spiritual blessings to\r\n  me.\r\n\r\n                     “Behind a frowning providence\r\n                     He hides a smiling face.”\r\n\r\n  Therefore I hope thou and my dear distressed parents will be\r\n  somewhat comforted about me, for I know you regard my spiritual\r\n  welfare far more than anything else.\r\n\r\nIn his next letter to the same friend he says:\r\n\r\n  Since I wrote my last, I have had a severe moral conflict, in which\r\n  I believe the right conquered, and has completely gained the\r\n  ascendency. The matter was this: A man with whom I have become\r\n  acquainted since my imprisonment offered to bail me out and let me\r\n  stay away from my trial, and pay the bail-bonds for me, and was very\r\n  anxious to do it. [Here he mentions that the funds held by this\r\n  individual had been placed in his hands by a person who obtained\r\n  them by dishonest means.] But having learned the above facts, which\r\n  he in confidence made known to me, I declined accepting his offer,\r\n  giving him my reasons in full. The matter rests with him, my\r\n  attorneys and myself. My attorneys do not know who he is, but, with\r\n  his permission, I in confidence informed them of the nature of the\r\n  case, after I came to a conclusion upon the subject, and had\r\n  determined not to accept the offer; which was approved by them. I\r\n  also had an offer of iron saws and files and other tools by which I\r\n  could break jail; but I refused them also, as I do not wish to\r\n  pursue any such underhanded course to extricate myself from my\r\n  present difficulties; for when I leave Tennessee—if I ever do—I am\r\n  determined to leave it a free man. Thou need not fear that I shall\r\n  ever stoop to dishonorable means to avoid my severe impending fate.\r\n  When I meet thee again I want to meet thee with a clear conscience,\r\n  and a character unspotted by disgrace.\r\n\r\nIn another place he says, in view of his nearly approaching trial:\r\n\r\n  O dear parents! The principles of love for my fellow-beings which\r\n  you have instilled into my mind are some of the greatest\r\n  consolations I have in my imprisonment, and they give me resignation\r\n  to bear whatever may be inflicted upon me without feeling any malice\r\n  or bitterness toward my vigilant prosecutors. If they show me mercy,\r\n  it will be accepted by me with gratitude; but if they do not, I will\r\n  endeavor to bear whatever they may inflict with Christian fortitude\r\n  and resignation, and try not to murmur at my lot; but it is hard to\r\n  obey the commandment, “Love your enemies.”\r\n\r\nThe day of his trial at length came.\r\n\r\nHis youth, his engaging manners, frank address, and invariable\r\ngentleness to all who approached him, had won many friends, and the\r\ntrial excited much interest.\r\n\r\n  His mother and her brother, Asa Williams, went a distance of seven\r\n  hundred and fifty miles to attend his trial. They carried with them\r\n  a certificate of his character, drawn up by Dr. Brisbane, and\r\n  numerously signed by his friends and acquaintances, and officially\r\n  countersigned by civil officers. This was done at the suggestion of\r\n  his counsel, and exhibited by them in court. When brought to the bar\r\n  it is said that “his demeanor was calm, dignified and manly.” His\r\n  mother sat by his side. The prosecuting attorney waived his plea,\r\n  and left the ground clear for Richard’s counsel. Their defence was\r\n  eloquent and pathetic. After they closed, Richard rose, and in a\r\n  calm and dignified manner spoke extemporaneously as follows:\r\n\r\n  “By the kind permission of the Court, for which I am sincerely\r\n  thankful, I avail myself of the privilege of adding a few words to\r\n  the remarks already made by my counsel. And although I stand, by my\r\n  own confession, as a criminal in the eyes of your violated laws, yet\r\n  I feel confident that I am addressing those who have hearts to feel;\r\n  and in meting out the punishment that I am about to suffer I hope\r\n  you will be lenient, for it is a new situation in which I am placed.\r\n  Never before, in the whole course of my life, have I been charged\r\n  with a dishonest act. And from my childhood kind parents, whose\r\n  names I deeply reverence, have instilled into my mind a desire to be\r\n  virtuous and honorable; and it has ever been my aim so to conduct\r\n  myself as to merit the confidence and esteem of my fellow-men. But,\r\n  gentlemen, I have violated your laws. This offence I did commit; and\r\n  I now stand before you, to my sorrow and regret, as a criminal. But\r\n  I was prompted to it by feelings of humanity. It has been suspected,\r\n  as I was informed, that I am leagued with a fraternity who are\r\n  combined for the purpose of committing such offences as the one with\r\n  which I am charged. But, gentlemen, the impression is false. I alone\r\n  am guilty, I alone committed the offence, and I alone must suffer\r\n  the penalty. My parents, my friends, my relatives, are as innocent\r\n  of any participation in or knowledge of my offence as the babe\r\n  unborn. My parents are still living,[2] though advanced in years,\r\n  and, in the course of nature, a few more years will terminate their\r\n  earthly existence. In their old age and infirmity they will need a\r\n  stay and protection; and if you can, consistently with your ideas of\r\n  justice, make my term of imprisonment a short one, you will receive\r\n  the lasting gratitude of a son who reverences his parents, and the\r\n  prayers and blessings of an aged father and mother who love their\r\n  child.”\r\n\r\n  A great deal of sensation now appeared in the court-room, and most\r\n  of the jury are said to have wept. They retired for a few moments,\r\n  and returned a verdict for three years imprisonment in the\r\n  penitentiary.\r\n\r\n  The _Nashville Daily Gazette_ of April 13, 1849, contains the\r\n  following notice:\r\n\r\n                         “THE KIDNAPPING CASE.\r\n\r\n  “Richard Dillingham, who was arrested on the 5th day of December\r\n  last, having in his possession three slaves whom he intended to\r\n  convey with him to a free state, was arraigned yesterday and tried\r\n  in the Criminal Court. The prisoner confessed his guilt, and made a\r\n  short speech in palliation of his offence. He avowed that the act\r\n  was undertaken by himself without instigation from any source, and\r\n  he alone was responsible for the error into which his education had\r\n  led him. He had, he said, no other motive than the good of the\r\n  slaves, and did not expect to claim any advantage by freeing them.\r\n  He was sentenced to three years imprisonment in the penitentiary,\r\n  the least time the law allows for the offence committed. Mr.\r\n  Dillingham is a Quaker from Ohio, and has been a teacher in that\r\n  state. He belongs to a respectable family, and he is not without the\r\n  sympathy of those who attended the trial. It was a foolhardy\r\n  enterprise in which he embarked, and dearly has he paid for his\r\n  rashness.”\r\n\r\n  His mother, before leaving Nashville, visited the governor, and had\r\n  an interview with him in regard to pardoning her son. He gave her\r\n  some encouragement, but thought she had better postpone her petition\r\n  for the present. After the lapse of several months, she wrote to him\r\n  about it; but he seemed to have changed his mind, as the following\r\n  letter will show:\r\n\r\n                                        “_Nashville, August 29, 1849._\r\n\r\n  “DEAR MADAM: Your letter of the 6th of the 7th mo. was received, and\r\n  would have been noticed earlier but for my absence from home. Your\r\n  solicitude for your son is natural, and it would be gratifying to be\r\n  able to reward it by releasing him, if it were in my power. But the\r\n  offence for which he is suffering was clearly made out, and its\r\n  tendency here is very hurtful to our rights, and our peace as a\r\n  people. He is doomed to the shortest period known to our statute.\r\n  And, at all events, I could not interfere with his case for some\r\n  time to come; and, to be frank with you, I do not see how his time\r\n  can be lessened at all. But my term of office will expire soon, and\r\n  the governor elect, Gen. William Tronsdale, will take my place. To\r\n  him you will make any future appeal.\r\n\r\n                                        “Yours, &c.      N. L. BROWN.”\r\n\r\n  The warden of the penitentiary, John McIntosh, was much prejudiced\r\n  against him. He thought the sentence was too light, and, being of a\r\n  stern bearing, Richard had not much to expect from his kindness. But\r\n  the same sterling integrity and ingenuousness which had ever, under\r\n  all circumstances, marked his conduct, soon wrought a change in the\r\n  minds of his keepers, and of his enemies generally. He became a\r\n  favorite with McIntosh, and some of the guard. According to the\r\n  rules of the prison, he was not allowed to write oftener than once\r\n  in three months, and what he wrote had, of course, to be inspected\r\n  by the warden.\r\n\r\nHe was at first put to sawing and scrubbing rock; but, as the delicacy\r\nof his frame unfitted him for such labors, and the spotless sanctity of\r\nhis life won the reverence of his jailers, he was soon promoted to be\r\nsteward of the prison hospital. In a letter to a friend he thus\r\nannounces this change in his situation:\r\n\r\n  I suppose thou art, ere this time, informed of the change in my\r\n  situation, having been placed in the hospital of the penitentiary as\r\n  steward.... I feel but poorly qualified to fill the situation they\r\n  have assigned me, but will try to do the best I can.... I enjoy the\r\n  comforts of a good fire and a warm room, and am allowed to sit up\r\n  evenings and read, which I prize as a great privilege.... I have now\r\n  been here nearly nine months, and have twenty-seven more to stay. It\r\n  seems to me a long time in prospect. I try to be as patient as I\r\n  can, but sometimes I get low-spirited. I throw off the thoughts of\r\n  home and friends as much as possible; for, when indulged in, they\r\n  only increase my melancholy feelings. And what wounds my feelings\r\n  most is the reflection of what you all suffer of grief and anxiety\r\n  for me. Cease to grieve for me, for I am unworthy of it; and it only\r\n  causes pain for you, without availing aught for me.... As ever,\r\n  thine in the bonds of affection,\r\n\r\n                                                                 R. D.\r\n\r\nHe had been in prison little more than a year when the cholera invaded\r\nNashville, and broke out among the inmates; Richard was up day and night\r\nin attendance on the sick, his disinterested and sympathetic nature\r\nleading him to labors to which his delicate constitution, impaired by\r\nconfinement, was altogether inadequate.\r\n\r\n           “Beside the bed where parting life was laid,\r\n           And sorrow, grief and pain, by turns dismayed,\r\n           The youthful champion stood: at his control\r\n           Despair and anguish fled the trembling soul,\r\n           Comfort came down the dying wretch to raise,\r\n           And his last faltering accents whispered praise.”\r\n\r\nWorn with these labors, the gentle, patient lover of God and of his\r\nbrother, sank at last overwearied, and passed peacefully away to a world\r\nwhere all are lovely and loving.\r\n\r\nThough his correspondence with her he most loved was interrupted, from\r\nhis unwillingness to subject his letters to the surveillance of the\r\nwarden, yet a note reached her, conveyed through the hands of a prisoner\r\nwhose time was out. In this letter, the last which any earthly friend\r\never received, he says:\r\n\r\n  I ofttimes, yea, _all_ times, think of thee;—if I did not, I should\r\n  cease to exist.\r\n\r\nWhat must that system be which makes it necessary to imprison with\r\nconvicted felons a man like this, because he loves his brother man “not\r\nwisely but too well”?\r\n\r\nOn his death Whittier wrote the following:\r\n\r\n       “Si crucem libenter portes, te portabit.”—_Imit. Christ._\r\n\r\n             “The Cross, if freely borne, shall be\r\n             No burthen, but support, to thee.”\r\n             So, moved of old time for our sake,\r\n             The holy man of Kempen spake.\r\n\r\n             Thou brave and true one, upon whom\r\n             Was laid the Cross of Martyrdom,\r\n             How didst thou, in thy faithful youth,\r\n             Bear witness to this blessed truth!\r\n\r\n             Thy cross of suffering and of shame\r\n             A staff within thy hands became;—\r\n             In paths, where Faith alone could see\r\n             The Master’s steps, upholding thee.\r\n\r\n             Thine was the seed-time: God alone\r\n             Beholds the end of what is sown;\r\n             Beyond our vision, weak and dim,\r\n             The harvest-time is hid with Him.\r\n\r\n             Yet, unforgotten where it lies,\r\n             That seed of generous sacrifice,\r\n             Though teeming on the desert cast,\r\n             Shall rise with bloom and fruit at last.\r\n\r\n                                           J. G. WHITTIER.\r\n\r\n  _Amesbury, Second. mo. 18th, 1852._\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  R. D.’s father survived him only a few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n                        THE SPIRIT OF ST. CLARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general tone of the press and of the community in the slave states,\r\nso far as it has been made known at the North, has been loudly\r\ncondemnatory of the representations of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” Still, it\r\nwould be unjust to the character of the South to refuse to acknowledge\r\nthat she has many sons with candor enough to perceive, and courage\r\nenough to avow, the evils of her “peculiar institutions.” The manly\r\nindependence exhibited by these men, in communities where popular\r\nsentiment rules despotically, either by law or in spite of law, should\r\nbe duly honored. The sympathy of such minds as these is a high\r\nencouragement to philanthropic effort.\r\n\r\nThe author inserts a few testimonials from Southern men, not without\r\nsome pride in being thus kindly judged by those who might have been\r\nnaturally expected to read her book with prejudice against it.\r\n\r\nThe _Jefferson Inquirer_, published at Jefferson City, Missouri, Oct.\r\n23, 1852, contains the following communication:\r\n\r\n                           UNCLE TOM’S CABIN.\r\n\r\n  I have lately read this celebrated book, which, perhaps, has gone\r\n  through more editions, and been sold in greater numbers, than any\r\n  work from the American press, in the same length of time. It is a\r\n  work of high literary finish, and its several characters are drawn\r\n  with great power and truthfulness, although, like the characters in\r\n  most novels and works of fiction, in some instances too highly\r\n  colored. There is no attack on slave-holders as such, but, on the\r\n  contrary, many of them are represented as highly noble, generous,\r\n  humane and benevolent. Nor is there any attack upon them as a class.\r\n  It sets forth many of the evils of slavery, as _an institution\r\n  established by law_, but without charging these evils on those who\r\n  hold the slaves, and seems fully to appreciate the difficulties in\r\n  finding a remedy. Its effect upon the slave-holder is to make him a\r\n  kinder and better master; to which none can object. This is said\r\n  without any intention to endorse everything contained in the book,\r\n  or, indeed, in any novel, or work of fiction. But, if I mistake not,\r\n  there are few, excepting those who are greatly prejudiced, that will\r\n  rise from a perusal of the book without being a truer and better\r\n  Christian, and a more humane and benevolent man. As a slave-holder,\r\n  I do not feel the least aggrieved. How Mrs. Stowe, the authoress,\r\n  has obtained her extremely accurate knowledge of the negroes, their\r\n  character, dialect, habits, &c., is beyond my comprehension, as she\r\n  never resided—as appears from the preface—in a slave state, or among\r\n  slaves or negroes. But they are certainly admirably delineated. The\r\n  book is highly interesting and amusing, and will afford a rich treat\r\n  to its reader.\r\n\r\n                                                     THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the editor himself is given in these words:\r\n\r\n                           UNCLE TOM’S CABIN.\r\n\r\n  Well, like a good portion of “the world and the rest of mankind,” we\r\n  have read the book of Mrs. Stowe bearing the above title.\r\n\r\n  From numerous statements, newspaper paragraphs and rumors, we\r\n  supposed the book was all that fanaticism and heresy could invent,\r\n  and were therefore greatly prejudiced against it. But, on reading\r\n  it, we cannot refrain from saying that it is a work of more than\r\n  ordinary moral worth, and is entitled to consideration. We do not\r\n  regard it as “a corruption of moral sentiment,” and a gross “libel\r\n  on a portion of our people.” The authoress seems disposed to treat\r\n  the subject fairly, though, in some particulars, the scenes are too\r\n  highly colored, and too strongly drawn from the imagination. The\r\n  book, however, may lead its readers at a distance to misapprehend\r\n  some of the general and better features of “Southern life as it is”\r\n  (which, by the way, we, as an individual, prefer to Northern life);\r\n  yet it is a perfect mirror of several classes of people “we have in\r\n  our mind’s eye, who are not free from all the ills flesh is heir\r\n  to.” It has been feared that the book would result in injury to the\r\n  slave-holding interests of the country; but we apprehend no such\r\n  thing, and hesitate not to recommend it to the perusal of our\r\n  friends and the public generally.\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Stowe has exhibited a knowledge of many peculiarities of\r\n  Southern society which is really wonderful, when we consider that\r\n  she is a Northern lady by birth and residence.\r\n\r\n  We hope, then, before our friends form any harsh opinions of the\r\n  merits of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” and make up any judgment against us\r\n  for pronouncing in its favor (barring some objections to it), that\r\n  they will give it a careful perusal; and, in so speaking, we may say\r\n  that we yield to no man in his devotion to Southern rights and\r\n  interests.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _St. Louis_ (Missouri) _Battery_ pronounces the\r\nfollowing judgment:\r\n\r\n  We took up this work, a few evenings since, with just such\r\n  prejudices against it as we presume many others have commenced\r\n  reading it. We have been so much in contact with ultra\r\n  abolitionists,—have had so much evidence that their benevolence was\r\n  much more hatred for the master than love for the slave, accompanied\r\n  with a profound ignorance of the circumstances surrounding both, and\r\n  a most consummate, supreme disgust for the whole negro race,—that we\r\n  had about concluded that anything but rant and nonsense was out of\r\n  the question from a Northern writer upon the subject of slavery.\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Stowe, in these delineations of life among the lowly, has\r\n  convinced us to the contrary.\r\n\r\n  She brings to the discussion of her subject a perfectly cool,\r\n  calculating judgment, a wide, all-comprehending intellectual vision,\r\n  and a deep, warm, sea-like woman’s soul, over all of which is flung\r\n  a perfect iris-like imagination, which makes the light of her\r\n  pictures stronger and more beautiful, as their shades are darker and\r\n  terror-striking.\r\n\r\n  We do not wonder that the copy before us is of the seventieth\r\n  thousand. And seventy thousand more will not supply the demand, or\r\n  we mistake the appreciation of the American people of the real\r\n  merits of literary productions. Mrs. Stowe has, in “Uncle Tom’s\r\n  Cabin,” set up for herself a monument more enduring than marble. It\r\n  will stand amid the wastes of slavery as the Memnon stands amid the\r\n  sands of the African desert, telling both the white man and the\r\n  negro of the approach of morning. The book is not an abolitionist\r\n  work, in the offensive sense of the word. It is, as we have\r\n  intimated, free from everything like fanaticism, no matter what\r\n  amount of enthusiasm vivifies every page, and runs like electricity\r\n  along every thread of the story. It presents at one view the\r\n  excellences and the evils of the system of slavery, and breathes the\r\n  true spirit of Christian benevolence for the slave, and charity for\r\n  the master.\r\n\r\nThe next witness gives his testimony in a letter to the _New York\r\nEvening Post_:\r\n\r\n                          LIGHT IN THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n  The subjoined communication comes to us postmarked New Orleans, June\r\n  19, 1852:\r\n\r\n  “I have just been reading ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin, or, Scenes in Lowly\r\n  Life,’ by Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe. It found its way to me through\r\n  the channel of a young student, who purchased it at the North, to\r\n  read on his homeward passage to New Orleans. He was entirely\r\n  unacquainted with its character; he was attracted by its title,\r\n  supposing it might amuse him while travelling. Through his family it\r\n  was shown to me, as something that I would probably like. I looked\r\n  at the author’s name, and said, ‘O, yes; anything from that lady I\r\n  will read;’ otherwise I should have disregarded a work of fiction\r\n  without such a title.\r\n\r\n  “The remarks from persons present were, that it was a most amusing\r\n  work, and the scenes most admirably drawn to life. I accepted the\r\n  offer of a perusal of it, and brought it home with me. Although I\r\n  have not read every sentence, I have looked over the whole of it,\r\n  and I now wish to bear my testimony to its just delineation of the\r\n  position that the slave occupies. Colorings in the work there are,\r\n  but no colorings of the actual and real position of the slave worse\r\n  than really exist. Whippings to death do occur; I know it to be so.\r\n  Painful separations of master and slave, under circumstances\r\n  creditable to the master’s feelings of humanity, do also occur. I\r\n  know that, too. Many families, after having brought up their\r\n  children in entire dependence on slaves to do everything for them,\r\n  and after having been indulged in elegances and luxuries, have\r\n  exhausted all their means; and the black people only being left,\r\n  whom they must sell, for further support. Running away, everybody\r\n  knows, is the worst crime a slave can commit, in the eyes of his\r\n  master, except it be a humane master; and from such few slaves care\r\n  to run away.\r\n\r\n  “I am a slave-holder myself. I have long been dissatisfied with the\r\n  system; particularly since I have made the Bible my criterion for\r\n  judging of it. I am convinced, from what I read there, slavery is\r\n  not in accordance with what God delights to honor in his creatures.\r\n  I am altogether opposed to the system; and I intend always to use\r\n  whatever influence I may have against it. I feel very bold in\r\n  speaking against it, though living in the midst of it, because I am\r\n  backed by a powerful arm, that can overturn and overrule the\r\n  strongest efforts that the determined friends of slavery are now\r\n  making for its continuance.\r\n\r\n  “I sincerely hope that more of Mrs. Stowes may be found, to show up\r\n  the reality of slavery. It needs master minds to show it as it is,\r\n  that it may rest upon its own merits.\r\n\r\n  “Like Mrs. Stowe, I feel that, since so many and good people, too,\r\n  at the North, have quietly consented to leave the slave to his fate,\r\n  by acquiescing in and approving the late measures of government,\r\n  those who do feel differently should bestir themselves. Christian\r\n  effort must do the work; and soon it would be done, if Christians\r\n  would unite, not to destroy the Union states, but honestly to speak\r\n  out, and speak freely, against that they know is wrong. They are not\r\n  aware what countenance they give to slave-holders to hold on to\r\n  their prey. Troubled consciences can be easily quieted by the\r\n  sympathies of pious people, particularly when interest and\r\n  inclination come in as aids.\r\n\r\n  “I am told there is to be a reply made to ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin,’\r\n  entitled ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin as It Is.’ I am glad of it.\r\n  Investigation is what is wanted.\r\n\r\n  “You will wonder why this communication is made to you by an\r\n  unknown. It is simply made to encourage your heart, and strengthen\r\n  your determination to persevere, and do all you can to put the\r\n  emancipation of the slave in progress. Who I am you will never know;\r\n  nor do I wish you to know, nor any one else. I am a\r\n\r\n                                                         “REPUBLICAN.”\r\n\r\nThe following facts make the fiction of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” appear tame\r\nin the comparison. They are from the _New York Evangelist_.\r\n\r\n                           UNCLE TOM’S CABIN.\r\n\r\n  MR. EDITOR: I see in your paper that some persons deny the\r\n  statements of Mrs. Stowe. I have read her book, _every word of it_.\r\n  I was born in East Tennessee, near Knoxville, and, _we thought_, in\r\n  an enlightened part of the Union, much favored in our social,\r\n  political and religious privileges, &c. &c. Well, I think about the\r\n  year 1829, or, perhaps, ‘28, a good old German Methodist owned a\r\n  black man named Robin, a Methodist preacher, and the manager of\r\n  farm, distillery, &c., salesman and financier. This good old German\r\n  Methodist had a son named Willey, a schoolmate of mine, and, as\r\n  times were, a first-rate fellow. The old man also owned a keen,\r\n  bright-eyed mulatto girl; and Willey—the naughty boy!—became\r\n  enamored of the poor girl. The result was soon discovered; and our\r\n  good German Methodist told his brother Robin to flog the girl for\r\n  her wickedness. Brother Robin said he could not and would not\r\n  perform such an act of cruelty as to flog the girl for what she\r\n  could not help; and for that act of disobedience old Robin was\r\n  flogged by the good old German brother, until he could not stand. He\r\n  was carried to bed; and, some three weeks thereafter, when my father\r\n  left the state, he was still confined to his bed from the effects of\r\n  that flogging.\r\n\r\n  Again: in the fall of 1836 I went South, for my health, stopped at a\r\n  village in Mississippi, and obtained employment in the largest house\r\n  in the county, as a book-keeper, with a firm from Louisville, Ky. A\r\n  man residing near the village—a bachelor, thirty years of age—became\r\n  embarrassed, and executed a mortgage to my employer on a fine,\r\n  likely boy, weighing about two hundred pounds,—quick-witted, active,\r\n  obedient, and remarkably faithful, trusty and honest; so much so,\r\n  that he was held up as an example. He had a wife that he loved. His\r\n  owner cast his eyes upon her, and she became his paramour. His boy\r\n  remonstrated with his master; told him that he tried faithfully to\r\n  perform his every duly; that he was a good and faithful “nigger” to\r\n  him; and it was hard, after he had toiled hard all day, and till ten\r\n  o’clock at night, for him to have his domestic relations broken up\r\n  and interfered with. The white man denied the charge, and the wife\r\n  also denied it. One night, about the first of September, the boy\r\n  came home earlier than usual, say about nine o’clock. It was a wet,\r\n  dismal night; he made a fire in his cabin, went to get his supper,\r\n  and found ocular demonstration of the guilt of his master. He became\r\n  enraged, as I suppose any man would, seized a butcher-knife, and cut\r\n  his master’s throat, stabbed his wife in twenty-seven places, came\r\n  to the village, and knocked at the office-door. I told him to come\r\n  in. He did so, and asked for my employer. I called him. The boy then\r\n  told him that he had killed his master and his wife, and what for.\r\n  My employer locked him up, and he, a doctor and myself, went out to\r\n  the house of the old bachelor, and found him dead, and the boy’s\r\n  wife nearly so. She, however, lived. We (my employer and myself)\r\n  returned to the village, watched the boy until about sunrise, left\r\n  him locked up, and went to get our breakfasts, intending to take the\r\n  boy to jail (as it was my employer’s interest, if possible, to save\r\n  the boy, having one thousand dollars at stake in him). But, whilst\r\n  we were eating, some persons who had heard of the murder broke open\r\n  the door, took the poor fellow, put a log chain round his neck, and\r\n  started him for the woods, at the point of the bayonet, marching by\r\n  where we were eating, with a great deal of noise. My employer,\r\n  hearing it, ran out, and rescued the boy. The mob again broke in and\r\n  took the boy, and marched him, as before stated, out of town.\r\n\r\n  My employer then begged them not to disgrace their town in such a\r\n  manner; but to appoint a jury of twelve sober men, to decide what\r\n  should be done. And twelve as _sober_ men as could be found (I was\r\n  not sober) said he must be hanged. They then tied a rope round his\r\n  neck, and set him on an old horse. He made a speech to the mob,\r\n  which I, at the time, thought if it had come from some senator,\r\n  would have been received with rounds of applause; and, withal, he\r\n  was more calm than I am now, in writing this. And, after he had told\r\n  all about the deed, and its cause, he then kicked the horse out from\r\n  under him, and was launched into eternity. My employer has often\r\n  remarked that he never saw anything more noble, in his whole life,\r\n  than the conduct of that boy.\r\n\r\n  Now, Mr. Editor, I have given you facts, and can give you names and\r\n  dates. You can do what you think is best for the cause of humanity.\r\n  I hope I have seen the evil of my former practices, and will\r\n  endeavor to reform.\r\n\r\n                                                Very respectfully,\r\n                                                        JAMES L. HILL.\r\n\r\n  _Springfield, Ill., Sept. 17th, 1852._\r\n\r\n“The Opinion of a Southerner,” given below, appeared in the _National\r\nEra_, published at Washington. This is an anti-slavery journal, but by\r\nits generous tone and eminent ability it commands the respect and\r\npatronage of many readers in the slave states:\r\n\r\n  The following communication comes enclosed in an envelope from\r\n  Louisiana.—_Ed. Era._\r\n\r\n                      THE OPINION OF A SOUTHERNER.\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the National Era_:\r\n\r\n  I have just been reading, in the _New York Observer_ of the 12th of\r\n  August, an article from the _Southern Free Press_, headed by an\r\n  editorial one from the _Observer_, that has for its caption,\r\n  “_Progress in the Right Quarter_.”\r\n\r\n  The editor of the _New York Observer_ says that the _Southern Free\r\n  Press_ has been an able and earnest defender of Southern\r\n  institutions; but that he now advocates the passage of a law to\r\n  prohibit the separation of families, and recommends instruction to a\r\n  portion of slaves that are most honest and faithful. The _Observer_\r\n  further adds: “It was such language as this that was becoming\r\n  common, before Northern fanaticism ruined the prospects of\r\n  emancipation.” It is not so! Northern fanaticism, as he calls it,\r\n  has done everything that has been done for bettering the condition\r\n  of the slave. Every one who knows anything of slavery for the last\r\n  thirty years will recollect that about that time since, the\r\n  condition of the slave in Louisiana—for about Louisiana only do I\r\n  speak, because about Louisiana only do I know—was as depressed and\r\n  miserable as any of the accounts of the abolitionists that ever I\r\n  have seen have made it. I say abolitionists; I mean friends and\r\n  advocates of freedom, in a fair and honorable way. If any doubt my\r\n  assertion, let them seek for information. Let them get the black\r\n  laws of Louisiana, and read them. Let them get facts from\r\n  individuals of veracity, on whose statements they would rely.\r\n\r\n  This wretched condition of slaves roused the friends of humanity,\r\n  who, like men, and Christian men, came fearlessly forward, and told\r\n  truths, indignantly expressing their abhorrence of their oppressors.\r\n  Such measures, of course, brought forth strife, which caused the\r\n  cries of humanity to sound louder and louder throughout the land.\r\n  The friends of freedom gained the ascendency in the hearts of the\r\n  people, and the slave-holders were brought to a stand. Some, through\r\n  fear of consequences, lessened their cruelties, while others were\r\n  made to think, that, perhaps, were not unwilling to do so when it\r\n  was urged upon them. Cruelties were not only refrained from, but the\r\n  slave’s comforts were increased. A retrograde treatment now was not\r\n  practicable. Fears of rebellion kept them to it. The slave had found\r\n  friends, and they were watchful. It was, however, soon discovered\r\n  that too many privileges, too much leniency, and giving knowledge,\r\n  would destroy the power to keep down the slave, and tend to weaken,\r\n  if not destroy, the system. Accordingly, stringent laws had to be\r\n  passed, and a penalty attached to them. No one must teach, or cause\r\n  to be taught, a slave, without incurring the penalty. The law is now\r\n  in force. These necessary laws, as they are called, are all put down\r\n  to the account of the friends of freedom—to their interference. I do\r\n  suppose that they do justly belong to their interference; for who\r\n  that studies the history of the world’s transactions does not know\r\n  that in all contests with power the weak, until successful, will be\r\n  dealt with more rigorously? Lose not sight, however, of their former\r\n  condition. Law after law has since been passed to draw the cord\r\n  tighter around the poor slave, and all attributed to the\r\n  abolitionists. Well, anyhow, progress is being made. Here comes out\r\n  the _Southern Press_, and makes some honorable concessions. He says:\r\n  “The assaults upon slavery, made for the last twenty years by the\r\n  North, have increased the evils of it. The treatment of slaves has\r\n  undoubtedly become a delicate and difficult question. The South has\r\n  a great and moral conflict to wage; and it is for her to put on _the\r\n  most invulnerable moral panoply_.” He then thinks the availability\r\n  of slave property would not be injured by passing a law to prohibit\r\n  the separation of slave families; for he says, “Although cases\r\n  sometimes occur which we observe are seized by these Northern\r\n  fanatics as characteristic of the system,” &c. Nonsense! there are\r\n  no “cases sometimes” occurring—no such thing! They are every day’s\r\n  occurrences, though there are families that form the exception, and\r\n  many, I would hope, that would not do it. While I am writing I can\r\n  call before me three men that were brought here by negro traders\r\n  from Virginia, each having left six or seven children, with their\r\n  wives, from whom they have never heard. One other died here, a short\r\n  time since, who left the same number in Carolina, from whom he had\r\n  never heard.\r\n\r\n  I spent the summer of 1845 in Nashville. During the month of\r\n  September, six hundred slaves passed through that place, in four\r\n  different gangs, for New Orleans—final destination, probably, Texas.\r\n  A goodly proportion were women; young women, of course; many mothers\r\n  must have left not only their children, but their babies. One gang\r\n  only had a few children. I made some excursions to the different\r\n  watering places around Nashville; and while at Robinson, or Tyree\r\n  Springs, twenty miles from Nashville, on the borders of Kentucky and\r\n  Tennessee, my hostess said to me, one day, “Yonder comes a gang of\r\n  slaves, chained.” I went to the road-side, and viewed them. For the\r\n  better answering my purpose of observation, I stopped the white man\r\n  in front, who was at his ease in a one-horse wagon, and asked him if\r\n  those slaves were for sale. I counted them and observed their\r\n  position. They were divided by three one-horse wagons, each\r\n  containing a man-merchant, so arranged as to command the whole gang.\r\n  Some were unchained; sixty were chained, in two companies, thirty in\r\n  each, the right hand of one to the left hand of the other opposite\r\n  one, making fifteen each side of a large ox-chain, to which every\r\n  hand was fastened, and necessarily compelled to hold up,—men and\r\n  women promiscuously, and about in equal proportions,—all young\r\n  people. No children here, except a few in a wagon behind, which were\r\n  the only children in the four gangs. I said to a respectable mulatto\r\n  woman in the house, “Is it true that the negro traders take mothers\r\n  from their babies?” “Missis, it is true; for here, last week, such a\r\n  girl [naming her], who lives about a mile off, was taken after\r\n  dinner,—knew nothing of it in the morning,—sold, put into the gang,\r\n  and her baby was given away to a neighbor. She was a stout young\r\n  woman, and brought a good price.”\r\n\r\n  The annexation of Texas induced the spirited traffic that summer.\r\n  Coming down home in a small boat, water low, a negro trader on board\r\n  had forty-five men and women crammed into a little spot, some\r\n  handcuffed. One respectable-looking man had left a wife and seven\r\n  children in Nashville. Near Memphis the boat stopped at a plantation\r\n  by previous arrangement, to take in thirty more. An hour’s delay was\r\n  the stipulated time with the captain of the boat. Thirty young men\r\n  and women came down the bank of the Mississippi, looking\r\n  wretchedness personified—just from the field; in appearance dirty,\r\n  disconsolate and oppressed; some with an old shawl under their arm,\r\n  a few had blankets; some had nothing at all—looked as though they\r\n  cared for nothing. I calculated, while looking at them coming down\r\n  the bank, that I could hold in a bundle all that the whole of them\r\n  had. The short notice that was given them, when about to leave, was\r\n  in consequence of the fears entertained that they would slip one\r\n  side. They all looked distressed,—leaving all that was dear to them\r\n  behind, to be put under the hammer, for the property of the highest\r\n  bidder. No children here! The whole seventy-five were crammed into a\r\n  little space on the boat, men and women all together.\r\n\r\n  I am happy to see that morality is rearing its head with advocates\r\n  for slavery, and that a “most invulnerable moral panoply” is thought\r\n  to be necessary. I hope it may not prove to be like Mr. Clay’s\r\n  compromises. The _Southern Press_ says: “As for caricatures of\r\n  slavery in ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ and the ‘White Slave,’ all founded in\r\n  imaginary circumstances, &c., we consider them highly incendiary. He\r\n  who undertakes to stir up strife between two individual neighbors,\r\n  by detraction, is justly regarded, by all men and all moral codes,\r\n  as a criminal.” Then he quotes the ninth commandment, and adds: “But\r\n  to bear false witness against whole states, and millions of people,\r\n  &c., would seem to be a crime as much deeper in turpitude as the\r\n  mischief is greater and the provocation less.” In the first place, I\r\n  will put the _Southern Press_ upon proof that Mrs. Harriet Beecher\r\n  Stowe has told one falsehood. If she has told truth, it is, indeed,\r\n  a powerful engine of “assault on slavery,” such as these Northern\r\n  fanatics have made for the “last twenty years.” The number against\r\n  whom she offends, in the editor’s opinion, seems to increase the\r\n  turpitude of her crime. That is good reasoning! I hope the editor\r\n  will be brought to feel that wholesale wickedness is worse than\r\n  single-handed, and is infinitely harder to reach, particularly if of\r\n  long standing. It gathers boldness and strength when it is\r\n  sanctioned by the authority of time, and aided by numbers that are\r\n  interested in supporting it. Such is slavery; and Mrs. Harriet\r\n  Beecher Stowe deserves the gratitude of “states and millions of\r\n  people” for her talented work, in showing it up in its true light.\r\n  She has advocated truth, justice and humanity, and they will back\r\n  her efforts. Her work will be read by “states and millions of\r\n  people;” and when the _Southern Press_ attempts to malign her, by\r\n  bringing forward her own avowal, “that the subject of slavery had\r\n  been so painful to her, that she had abstained from conversing on it\r\n  for several years,” and that, in his opinion, “it accounts for the\r\n  intensity of the venom of her book,” his _really_ envenomed shafts\r\n  will fall harmless at her feet; for readers will judge for\r\n  themselves, and be very apt to conclude that more venom comes from\r\n  the _Southern Press_ than from her. She advocates what is right, and\r\n  has a straight road, which “few get lost on;” he advocates what is\r\n  wrong, and has, consequently, to tack, concede, deny, slander, and\r\n  all sorts of things.\r\n\r\n  With all due deference to whatever of just principles the _Southern\r\n  Press_ may have advanced in favor of the slave, I am a poor judge of\r\n  human nature if I mistake in saying that Mrs. Stowe has done much to\r\n  draw from him those concessions; and the putting forth of this\r\n  “_most invulnerable moral panoply_,” that has just come into his\r\n  head as a bulwark of safety for slavery, owes its impetus to her,\r\n  and other like efforts. I hope the _Southern Press_ will not imitate\r\n  the spoiled child, who refused to eat his pie for spite.\r\n\r\n  The “White Slave” I have not seen. I guess its character, for I made\r\n  a passage to New York, some fourteen or fifteen years since, in a\r\n  packet-ship, with a young woman whose face was enveloped in a\r\n  profusion of light brown curls, and who sat at the table with the\r\n  passengers all the way as a white woman. When at the quarantine,\r\n  Staten Island, the captain received a letter, sent by express mail,\r\n  from a person in New Orleans, claiming her as his slave, and\r\n  threatening the captain with the penalty of the existing law if she\r\n  was not immediately returned. The streaming eyes of the poor,\r\n  unfortunate girl told the truth, when the captain reluctantly broke\r\n  it to her. She unhesitatingly confessed that she had run away, and\r\n  that a friend had paid her passage. Proper measures were taken, and\r\n  she was conveyed to a packet-ship that was at Sandy Hook, bound for\r\n  New Orleans.\r\n\r\n  “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” I think, is a just delineation of slavery. The\r\n  incidents are colored, but the position that the slave is made to\r\n  hold is just. I did not read every page of it, my object being to\r\n  ascertain what position the slave occupied. I could state a case of\r\n  whipping to death that would equal Uncle Tom’s; still, such cases\r\n  are not very frequent.\r\n\r\n  The stirring up of strife between neighbors, that the _Southern\r\n  Press_ complains of, deserves notice. Who are neighbors? The most\r\n  explicit answer to this question will be found in the reply Christ\r\n  made to the lawyer, when he asked it of him. Another question will\r\n  arise, Whether, in Christ’s judgment, Mrs. Stowe would be considered\r\n  a neighbor or an incendiary? As the Almighty Ruler of the universe\r\n  and the Maker of man has said that He has made all the nations of\r\n  the earth of one blood, and man in His own image, the black man,\r\n  irrespective of his color, would seem to be a neighbor who has\r\n  fallen among his enemies, that have deprived him of the fruits of\r\n  his labor, his liberty, his right to his wife and children, his\r\n  right to obtain the knowledge to read, or to anything that earth\r\n  holds dear, except such portions of food and raiment as will fit him\r\n  for his despoiler’s purposes. Let not the apologists for slavery\r\n  bring up the isolated cases of leniency, giving instruction, and\r\n  affectionate attachment, that are found among some masters, as\r\n  specimens of slavery! It is unfair! They form exceptions, and much\r\n  do I respect them; but they are not the rules of slavery. The strife\r\n  that is being stirred up is not to take away anything that belongs\r\n  to another,—neither their silver or gold, their fine linen or\r\n  purple, their houses or land, their horses or cattle, or anything\r\n  that is their property; but to rescue a neighbor from their unmanly\r\n  cupidity.\r\n\r\n                                                         A REPUBLICAN.\r\n\r\nNo introduction is necessary to explain the following correspondence,\r\nand no commendation will be required to secure for it a respectful\r\nattention from thinking readers:\r\n\r\n                                      { _Washington City, D.

GOODLOE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: I understand that you are a North Carolinian, and have\r\n  always resided in the South, you must, consequently, be acquainted\r\n  with the workings of the institution of slavery. You have doubtless\r\n  also read that world-renowned book, “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” by Mrs.\r\n  Stowe. The apologists for slavery deny that this book is a truthful\r\n  picture of slavery. They say that its representations are\r\n  exaggerated, its scenes and incidents unfounded, and, in a word,\r\n  that the whole book is a _caricature_. They also deny that families\r\n  are separated,—that children are sold from their parents, wives from\r\n  their husbands, &c. Under these circumstances, I am induced to ask\r\n  your opinion of Mrs. Stowe’s book, and whether or not, in your\r\n  opinion, her statements are entitled to credit.\r\n\r\n                                           I have the honor to be,\r\n                                                   Yours, truly,\r\n                                                       A. M. GANGEWER.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                           _Washington, Dec. 8, 1852._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: Your letter of the 6th inst., asking my opinion of “Uncle\r\n  Tom’s Cabin,” has been received; and there being no reason why I\r\n  should withhold it, unless it be the fear of public opinion (your\r\n  object being, as I understand, the publication of my reply), I\r\n  proceed to give it in some detail.\r\n\r\n  A book of fiction, to be worth reading, must necessarily be filled\r\n  with rare and striking incidents, and the leading characters must be\r\n  remarkable, some for great virtues, others, perhaps, for great vices\r\n  or follies. A narrative of the ordinary events in the lives of\r\n  commonplace people would be insufferably dull and insipid; and a\r\n  book made up of such materials would be, to the elegant and graphic\r\n  pictures of life and manners which we have in the writings of Sir\r\n  Walter Scott and Dickens, what a surveyor’s plot of a ten-acre field\r\n  is to a painted landscape, in which the eye is charmed by a thousand\r\n  varieties of hill and dale, of green shrubbery and transparent\r\n  water, of light and shade, at a glance. In order to determine\r\n  whether a novel is a fair picture of society, it is not necessary to\r\n  ask if its chief personages are to be met with every day; but\r\n  whether they are characteristic of the times and country,—whether\r\n  they embody the prevalent sentiments, virtues, vices, follies, and\r\n  peculiarities,—and whether the events, tragic or otherwise, are such\r\n  as may and do occasionally occur.\r\n\r\n  Judging “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” by these principles, I have no\r\n  hesitation in saying that it is a faithful portraiture of Southern\r\n  life and institutions. There is nothing in the book inconsistent\r\n  with the laws and usages of the slave-holding states; the virtues,\r\n  vices, and peculiar hues of character and manners, are all Southern,\r\n  and must be recognized at once by every one who reads the book. I\r\n  may never have seen such depravity in one man as that exhibited in\r\n  the character of Legree, though I have ten thousand times witnessed\r\n  the various shades of it in different individuals. On the other\r\n  hand, I have never seen so many perfections concentrated in one\r\n  human being as Mrs. Stowe has conferred upon the daughter of a\r\n  slave-holder. Evangeline is an image of beauty and goodness which\r\n  can never be effaced from the mind, whatever may be its prejudices.\r\n  Yet her whole character is fragrant of the South; her generous\r\n  sympathy, her beauty and delicacy, her sensibility are all Southern.\r\n  They are “to the manor born,” and embodying as they do the Southern\r\n  ideal of beauty and loveliness, cannot be ostracized from Southern\r\n  hearts, even by the power of the vigilance committees.\r\n\r\n  The character of St. Clare cannot fail to inspire love\r\n  and admiration. He is the _beau idéal_ of a Southern\r\n  gentleman,—honorable, generous and humane, of accomplished manners,\r\n  liberal education, and easy fortune. In his treatment of his slaves,\r\n  he errs on the side of lenity, rather than vigor; and is always\r\n  their kind protector, from a natural impulse of goodness, without\r\n  much reflection upon what may befall them when death or misfortune\r\n  shall deprive them of his friendship.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Shelby, the original owner of Uncle Tom, and who sells him to a\r\n  trader, from the pressure of a sort of pecuniary necessity, is by no\r\n  means a bad character; his wife and son are whatever honor and\r\n  humanity could wish; and, in a word, the only white persons who make\r\n  any considerable figure in the book to a disadvantage are the\r\n  villain Legree, who is a Vermonter by birth, and the oily-tongued\r\n  slave-trader Haley, who has the accent of a Northerner. It is,\r\n  therefore, evident that Mrs. Stowe’s object in writing “Uncle Tom’s\r\n  Cabin” has not been to disparage Southern character. A careful\r\n  analysis of the book would authorize the opposite inference,—that\r\n  she has studied to shield the Southern people from opprobrium, and\r\n  even to convey an elevated idea of Southern society, at the moment\r\n  of exposing the evils of the system of slavery. She directs her\r\n  batteries against the institution, not against individuals; and\r\n  generously makes a renegade Vermonter stand for her most hideous\r\n  picture of a brutal tyrant.\r\n\r\n  Invidious as the duty may be, I cannot withhold my testimony to the\r\n  fact that families of slaves are often separated. I know not how any\r\n  man can have the hardihood to deny it. The thing is notorious, and\r\n  is often the subject of painful remark in the Southern States. I\r\n  have often heard the practice of separating husband and wife, parent\r\n  and child, defended, apologized for, palliated in a thousand ways,\r\n  but have never heard it denied. How could it be denied, in fact,\r\n  when probably the very circumstance which elicited the conversation\r\n  was a case of cruel separation then transpiring? No, sir! the denial\r\n  of this fact by mercenary scribblers may deceive persons at a\r\n  distance, but it can impose upon no one at the South.\r\n\r\n  In all the slave-holding states the relation of matrimony between\r\n  slaves, or between a slave and free person, is merely voluntary.\r\n  There is no law sanctioning it, or recognizing it in any shape,\r\n  directly or indirectly. In a word, it is illicit, and binds no\r\n  one,—neither the slaves themselves nor their masters. In separating\r\n  husband and wife, or parent and child, the trader or owner violates\r\n  no law of the state—neither statute nor common law. He buys or sells\r\n  at auction or privately that which the majesty of the law has\r\n  declared to be property. The victims may writhe in agony, and the\r\n  tender-hearted spectator may look on with gloomy sorrow and\r\n  indignation, but it is to no purpose. The promptings of mercy and\r\n  justice in the heart are only in rebellion against the law of the\r\n  land.\r\n\r\n  The law itself not unfrequently performs the most cruel separations\r\n  of families, almost without the intervention of individual agency.\r\n  This happens in the case of persons who die insolvent, or who become\r\n  so during lifetime. The estate, real and personal, must be disposed\r\n  of at auction to the highest bidder, and the executor,\r\n  administrator, sheriff, trustee, or other person whose duty it is to\r\n  dispose of the property, although he may possess the most humane\r\n  intentions in the world, cannot prevent the final severance of the\r\n  most endearing ties of kindred. The illustration given by Mrs.\r\n  Stowe, in the sale of Uncle Tom by Mr. Shelby, is a very common\r\n  case. Pecuniary embarrassment is a most fruitful source of\r\n  misfortune to the slave as well as the master; and instances of\r\n  family ties broken from this cause are of daily occurrence.\r\n\r\n  It often happens that great abuses exist in violation of law, and in\r\n  spite of the efforts of the authorities to suppress them; such is\r\n  the case with drunkenness, gambling, and other vices. But here is a\r\n  law common to all the slave-holding states, which upholds and gives\r\n  countenance to the wrong-doer, while its blackest terrors are\r\n  reserved for those who would interpose to protect the innocent.\r\n  Statesmen of elevated and honorable characters, from a vague notion\r\n  of state necessity, have defended this law in the abstract, while\r\n  they would, without hesitation, condemn every instance of its\r\n  application as unjust.\r\n\r\n  In one respect I am glad to see it publicly denied that the families\r\n  of slaves are separated; for while it argues a disreputable want of\r\n  candor, it at the same time evinces a commendable sense of shame,\r\n  and induces the hope that the public opinion at the South will not\r\n  much longer tolerate this most odious, though not essential, part of\r\n  the system of slavery.\r\n\r\n  In this connection I will call to your recollection a remark of the\r\n  editor of the _Southern Press_, in one of the last numbers of that\r\n  paper, which acknowledges the existence of the abuse in question,\r\n  and recommends its correction. He says:\r\n\r\n  “The South has a great moral conflict to wage; and it is for her to\r\n  put on the most invulnerable moral panoply. Hence it is her duty, as\r\n  well as interest, to mitigate or remove whatever of evil that\r\n  results incidentally from the institution. The separation of husband\r\n  and wife, parent and child, is one of these evils, which we know is\r\n  generally avoided and repudiated there—although cases sometimes\r\n  occur which we observe are seized by these Northern fanatics as\r\n  characteristic illustrations of the system. Now we can see no great\r\n  evil or inconvenience, but much good, in the prohibition by law of\r\n  such occurrences. Let the husband and wife be sold together, and the\r\n  parents and minor children. Such a law would affect but slightly the\r\n  general value or availability of slave property, and would prevent\r\n  in some cases the violence done to the feelings of such connections\r\n  by sales either compulsory or voluntary. We are satisfied that it\r\n  would be beneficial to the master and slave to promote marriage, and\r\n  the observance of all its duties and relations.”\r\n\r\n  Much as I have differed with the editor of the _Southern Press_ in\r\n  his general views of public policy, I am disposed to forgive him\r\n  past errors in consideration of his public acknowledgment of this\r\n  “incidental evil,” and his frank recommendation of its removal. A\r\n  Southern newspaper less devoted than the _Southern Press_ to the\r\n  maintenance of slavery would be seriously compromised by such a\r\n  suggestion, and its advice would be far less likely to be heeded. I\r\n  think, therefore, that Mr. Fisher deserves the thanks of every good\r\n  man, North and South, for thus boldly pointing out the necessity of\r\n  reform.\r\n\r\n  The picture which Mrs. Stowe has drawn of slavery as an institution\r\n  is anything but favorable. She has illustrated the frightful cruelty\r\n  and oppression that must result from a law which gives to one class\r\n  of society almost absolute and irresponsible power over another. Yet\r\n  the very machinery she has employed for this purpose shows that all\r\n  who are parties to the system are not necessarily culpable. It is a\r\n  high virtue in St. Clare to purchase Uncle Tom. He is actuated by no\r\n  selfish or improper motive. Moved by a desire to gratify his\r\n  daughter, and prompted by his own humane feelings, he purchases a\r\n  slave, in order to rescue him from a hard fate on the plantations.\r\n  If he had not been a slave-holder before, it was now his duty to\r\n  become one. This, I think, is the moral to be drawn from the story\r\n  of St. Clare, and the South have a right to claim the authority of\r\n  Mrs. Stowe in defence of slave-holding, to this extent.\r\n\r\n  It may be said that it was the duty of St. Clare to emancipate Uncle\r\n  Tom; but the wealth of the Rothschilds would not enable a man to act\r\n  out his benevolent instincts at such a price. And if such was his\r\n  duty, is it not equally the duty of every monied man in the free\r\n  states to attend the New Orleans slave-mart with the same benevolent\r\n  purpose in view? It seems to me that to purchase a slave with the\r\n  purpose of saving him from a hard and cruel fate, and without any\r\n  view to emancipation, is itself a good action. If the slave should\r\n  subsequently become able to redeem himself, it would doubtless be\r\n  the duty of the owner to emancipate him; and it would be but\r\n  even-handed justice to set down every dollar of the slave’s\r\n  earnings, above the expense of his maintenance, to his credit, until\r\n  the price paid for him should be fully restored. This is all that\r\n  justice could exact of the slave-holder.\r\n\r\n  Those who have railed against “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” as an incendiary\r\n  publication have singularly (supposing that they have read the book)\r\n  overlooked the moral of the hero’s life. Uncle Tom is the most\r\n  faithful of servants. He literally “obeyed in all things” his\r\n  “masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as\r\n  men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.” If his\r\n  conduct exhibits the slightest departure from a literal fulfilment\r\n  of this injunction of Scripture, it is in a case which must command\r\n  the approbation of the most rigid casuist; for the injunction of\r\n  obedience extends, of course, only to lawful commands. It is only\r\n  when the monster Legree commands him to inflict undeserved\r\n  chastisement upon his fellow-servants, that Uncle Tom refuses\r\n  obedience. He would not listen to a proposition of escaping into\r\n  Ohio with the young woman Eliza, on the night after they were sold\r\n  by Mr. Shelby to the trader Haley. He thought it would be bad faith\r\n  to his late master, whom he had nursed in his arms, and might be the\r\n  means of bringing him into difficulty. He offered no resistance to\r\n  Haley, and obeyed even Legree in every legitimate command. But when\r\n  he was required to be the instrument of his master’s cruelty, he\r\n  chose rather to die, with the courage and resolution of a Christian\r\n  martyr, than to save his life by a guilty compliance. Such was Uncle\r\n  Tom—not a bad example for the imitation of man or master.\r\n\r\n                                         I am, sir, very respectfully,\r\n                                             Your ob’t serv’t,\r\n                                                 DANIEL R. GOODLOE.\r\n\r\n  A. M. GANGEWER, Esq.,\r\n    Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nThe writer has received permission to publish the following extract from\r\na letter received by a lady at the North from the editor of a Southern\r\npaper. The mind and character of the author will speak for themselves,\r\nin the reading of it:\r\n\r\n                                _Charleston, Sunday, 25th July, 1852._\r\n\r\n  * * * The books, I infer, are Mrs. Beecher Stowe’s “_Uncle Tom’s\r\n  Cabin_.” The book was furnished me by —— ——, about a fortnight ago,\r\n  and you may be assured I read it with an attentive interest. “Now,\r\n  what is your opinion of it?” you will ask; and, knowing my\r\n  preconceived opinions upon the question of slavery, and the\r\n  embodiment of my principles, which I have so long supported, in\r\n  regard to that _peculiar_ institution, you may be prepared to meet\r\n  an indirect answer. This my own consciousness of truth would not\r\n  allow, in the present instance. The book is a truthful picture of\r\n  life, with the dark outlines beautifully portrayed. The life—the\r\n  characteristics, incidents, and the dialogues—is life itself reduced\r\n  to paper. In her appendix she rather evades the question whether it\r\n  was taken from actual scones, but says there are many counterparts.\r\n  In this she is correct, beyond doubt. Had she changed the picture of\r\n  Legree, on Red river, for —— ——, on —— Island, South Carolina, she\r\n  could not have drawn a more admirable portrait. I am led to question\r\n  whether she had not some knowledge of this beast, as he is known to\r\n  be, and made the transposition for effect.\r\n\r\n  My position in connection with the extreme party, both in Georgia\r\n  and South Carolina, would constitute a restraint to the full\r\n  expression of my feelings upon several of the governing principles\r\n  of the institution. I have studied slavery, in all its different\r\n  phases,—have been thrown in contact with the negro in different\r\n  parts of the world, and made it my aim to study his nature, so far\r\n  as my limited abilities would give me light,—and, whatever my\r\n  opinions have been, they were based upon what I supposed to be\r\n  honest convictions.\r\n\r\n  During the last three years you well know what my opportunities have\r\n  been to examine all the sectional bearings of an institution which\r\n  now holds the great and most momentous question of our federal\r\n  well-being. These opportunities I have not let pass, but have given\r\n  myself, body and soul, to a knowledge of its vast intricacies,—to\r\n  its constitutional compact, and its individual hardships. Its wrongs\r\n  are in the constituted rights of the master, and the _blank letter_\r\n  of those laws which pretend to govern the bondman’s rights. What\r\n  legislative act, based upon the construction of self-protection for\r\n  the very men who contemplate the laws,—even though their intention\r\n  was amelioration,—could be enforced, when the legislated object is\r\n  held as the _bond property_ of the legislator? The very fact of\r\n  constituting a law for the amelioration of property becomes an\r\n  absurdity, so far as carrying it out is concerned. A law which is\r\n  intended to govern, and gives the governed no means of seeking its\r\n  protection, is like the clustering together of so many useless words\r\n  for vain show. But why talk of law? That which is considered the\r\n  popular rights of a people, and every tenacious prejudice set forth\r\n  to protect its property interest, creates its own power, against\r\n  every weaker vessel. Laws which interfere with this become\r\n  unpopular,—repugnant to a forceable will, and a dead letter in\r\n  effect. So long as the voice of the governed cannot be heard, and\r\n  his wrongs are felt beyond the jurisdiction or domain of the law, as\r\n  nine-tenths are, where is the hope of redress? The master is the\r\n  powerful vessel; the negro feels his dependence, and, fearing the\r\n  consequences of an appeal for his rights, submits to the cruelty of\r\n  his master, in preference to the dread of something more cruel. It\r\n  is in those disputed cases of cruelty we find the wrongs of slavery,\r\n  and in those governing laws which give power to bad Northern men to\r\n  become the most cruel taskmasters. Do not judge, from my\r\n  observations, that I am seeking consolation for the abolitionists.\r\n  Such is not my intention; but truth to a course which calls loudly\r\n  for reformation constrains me to say that humanity calls for some\r\n  law to govern the force and absolute will of the master, and to\r\n  reform no part is more requisite than that which regards the slave’s\r\n  food and raiment. A person must live years at the South before he\r\n  can become fully acquainted with the many workings of slavery. A\r\n  Northern man not prominently interested in the political and social\r\n  weal of the South may live for years in it, and pass from town to\r\n  town in his every-day pursuits, and yet see but the polished side of\r\n  slavery. With me it has been different. Its effect upon the negro\r\n  himself, and its effect upon the social and commercial well-being of\r\n  Southern society, has been laid broadly open to me, and I have seen\r\n  more of its workings within the past year than was disclosed to me\r\n  all the time before. It is with these feelings that I am constrained\r\n  to do credit to Mrs. Stowe’s book, which I consider must have been\r\n  written by one who derived the materials from a thorough\r\n  acquaintance with the subject. The character of the slave-dealer,\r\n  the bankrupt owner in Kentucky, and the New Orleans merchant, are\r\n  simple every-day occurrences in these parts. Editors may speak of\r\n  the dramatic effect as they please; the tale is not told them, and\r\n  the occurrences of common reality would form a picture more glaring.\r\n  I could write a work, with date and incontrovertible facts, of\r\n  abuses which stand recorded in the knowledge of the community in\r\n  which they were transacted, that would need no dramatic effect, and\r\n  would stand out ten-fold more horrible than anything Mrs. Stowe has\r\n  described.\r\n\r\n  I have read two columns in the _Southern Press_ of Mrs. Eastman’s\r\n  “_Aunt Phillis’ Cabin_, or Southern Life as It Is,” with the remarks\r\n  of the editor. I have no comments to make upon it, that being done\r\n  by itself. The editor might have saved himself being writ down an\r\n  ass by the public, if he had withheld his nonsense. If the two\r\n  columns are a specimen of Mrs. Eastman’s book, I pity her attempt\r\n  and her name as an author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New York _Courier and Enquirer_ of November 5th contained an article\r\nwhich has been quite valuable to the author, as summing up, in a clear,\r\nconcise and intelligible form, the principal objections which may be\r\nurged to _Uncle Tom’s Cabin_. It is here quoted in full, as the\r\nfoundation of the remarks in the following pages.\r\n\r\nThe author of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” that writer states, has committed\r\nfalse-witness against thousands and millions of her fellow-men.\r\n\r\n  She has done it [he says] by attaching to them as slaveholders, in\r\n  the eyes of the world, the guilt of the abuses of an institution of\r\n  which they are absolutely guiltless. Her story is so devised as to\r\n  present slavery in three dark aspects: first, the _cruel treatment_\r\n  of the slaves; second, _the separation of families_; and, third,\r\n  their _want of religious instruction_.\r\n\r\n  To show the first, she causes a reward to be offered for the\r\n  recovery of a runaway slave, “dead or alive,” when no reward with\r\n  such an alternative was ever heard of, or dreamed of, south of Mason\r\n  and Dixon’s line, and it has been decided over and over again in\r\n  Southern courts that “a slave who is merely flying away cannot be\r\n  killed.” She puts such language as this into the mouth of one of her\r\n  speakers:—“The master who goes furthest and does the worst only uses\r\n  within limits the power that the law gives him;” when, in fact, the\r\n  civil code of the very state where it is represented the language\r\n  was uttered—Louisiana—declares that\r\n\r\n  “The slave is entirely subject to the will of his master, who may\r\n  correct and chastise him, _though not with unusual rigor, nor so as\r\n  to maim or mutilate him, or to expose him to the danger of loss of\r\n  life, or to cause his death_.”\r\n\r\n  And provides for a compulsory sale\r\n\r\n  “When the master shall be convicted of cruel treatment of his\r\n  slaves, and the judge shall deem proper to pronounce, besides the\r\n  penalty established for such cases, that the slave be sold at public\r\n  auction, _in order to place him out of the reach of the power which\r\n  the master has abused_.”\r\n\r\n  “If any person whatsoever shall wilfully kill his slave, or the\r\n  slave of another person, the said person, being convicted thereof,\r\n  shall be tried and condemned agreeably to the laws.”\r\n\r\n  In the General Court of Virginia, last year, in the case of Souther\r\n  _v._ the Commonwealth, it was held that the killing of a slave by\r\n  his master and owner, by wilful and excessive whipping, is murder in\r\n  the first degree, _though it may not have been the purpose of the\r\n  master and owner to kill the slave_! And it is not six months since\r\n  Governor Johnston, of Virginia, pardoned a slave who killed his\r\n  master, who was beating him with brutal severity.\r\n\r\n  And yet, in the face of such laws and decisions as these, Mrs. Stowe\r\n  winds up a long series of cruelties upon her other black personages,\r\n  by causing her faultless hero, Tom, to be literally whipped to death\r\n  in Louisiana, by his master, Legree; and these acts, which the laws\r\n  make criminal, and punish as such, she sets forth in the most\r\n  repulsive colors, to illustrate the institution of slavery!\r\n\r\n  So, too, in reference to the separation of children from their\r\n  parents. A considerable part of the plot is made to hinge upon the\r\n  selling, in Louisiana, of the child Eliza, “eight or nine years\r\n  old,” away from her mother; when, had its inventor looked in the\r\n  statute-book of Louisiana, she would have found the following\r\n  language:\r\n\r\n  “Every person is expressly prohibited from selling separately from\r\n  their mothers _the children who shall not have attained the full age\r\n  of ten years_.”\r\n\r\n  “_Be it further enacted_, That if any person or persons shall sell\r\n  the mother of any slave child or children _under the age of ten\r\n  years, separate from said child or children, or shall, the mother\r\n  living, sell any slave child or children of ten years of age, or\r\n  under, separate from said mother_, said person or persons shall be\r\n  fined not less than one thousand nor more than two thousand dollars,\r\n  and be imprisoned in the public jail for a period of not less than\r\n  six months nor more than one year.”\r\n\r\n  The privation of religious instruction, as represented by Mrs.\r\n  Stowe, is utterly unfounded in fact. The largest churches in the\r\n  Union consist entirely of slaves. The first African church in\r\n  Louisville, which numbers fifteen hundred persons, and the first\r\n  African church in Augusta, which numbers thirteen hundred, are\r\n  specimens. On multitudes of the large plantations in the different\r\n  parts of the South the ordinances of the gospel are as regularly\r\n  maintained, by competent ministers, as in any other communities,\r\n  north or south. A larger proportion of the slave population are in\r\n  communion with some Christian church, than of the white population\r\n  in any part of the country. A very considerable portion of every\r\n  southern congregation, either in city or country, is sure to consist\r\n  of blacks; whereas, of our northern churches, not a colored person\r\n  is to be seen in one out of fifty.\r\n\r\n  The peculiar falsity of this whole book consists in making\r\n  exceptional or impossible cases the representatives of the system.\r\n  By the same process which she has used, it would not be difficult to\r\n  frame a fatal argument against the relation of husband and wife, or\r\n  parent and child, or of guardian and ward; for thousands of wives\r\n  and children and wards have been maltreated, and even murdered. It\r\n  is wrong, unpardonably wrong, to impute to any relation of life\r\n  those enormities which spring only out of the worst depravity of\r\n  human nature. A ridiculously extravagant spirit of generalization\r\n  pervades this fiction from beginning to end. The Uncle Tom of the\r\n  authoress is a perfect angel, and her blacks generally are half\r\n  angels; her Simon Legree is a perfect demon, and her whites\r\n  generally are half demons. She has quite a peculiar spite against\r\n  the clergy; and, of the many she introduces at different times into\r\n  the scenes, all, save an insignificant exception, are Pharisees or\r\n  hypocrites. One who could know nothing of the United States and its\r\n  people, except by what he might gather from this book, would judge\r\n  that it was some region just on the confines of the infernal world.\r\n  We do not say that Mrs. Stowe was actuated by wrong motives in the\r\n  preparation of this work, but we do say that she has done a wrong\r\n  which no ignorance can excuse and no penance can expiate.\r\n\r\nA much-valued correspondent of the author, writing from Richmond,\r\nVirginia, also uses the following language:\r\n\r\n  I will venture this morning to make a few suggestions which have\r\n  occurred to me in regard to future editions of your work, “Uncle\r\n  Tom’s Cabin,” which I desire should have all the influence of which\r\n  your genius renders it capable, not only abroad, but in the local\r\n  sphere of slavery, where it has been hitherto repudiated. Possessing\r\n  already the great requisites of artistic beauty and of sympathetic\r\n  affection, it may yet be improved in regard to accuracy of statement\r\n  without being at all enfeebled. For example, you do less than\r\n  justice to the formalized laws of the Southern States, while you\r\n  give more credit than is due to the virtue of public or private\r\n  sentiment in restricting the evil which the laws permit.\r\n\r\n  I enclose the following extracts from a southern paper:\r\n\r\n    “‘I’ll manage that ar; they’s young in the business, and must\r\n    spect to work cheap,’ said Marks, as he continued to read.\r\n    ‘Thar’s three on ‘em easy cases, ‘cause all you’ve got to do is\r\n    to shoot ‘em, or swear they is shot; they couldn’t, of course,\r\n    charge much for that.’”\r\n\r\n  “The reader will observe that two charges against the South are\r\n  involved in this precious discourse;—one that it is the habit of\r\n  Southern masters to offer a reward, with the alternative of ‘dead or\r\n  alive,’ for their fugitive slaves; and the other, that it is usual\r\n  for pursuers to shoot them. Indeed, we are led to infer that, as the\r\n  shooting is the easier mode of obtaining the reward, it is the more\r\n  frequently employed in such cases. Now, when a Southern master\r\n  offers a reward for his runaway slave, it is because he has lost a\r\n  certain amount of property, represented by the negro which he wishes\r\n  to recover. What man of Vermont, having an ox or an ass that had\r\n  gone astray, would forthwith offer half the full value of the\r\n  animal, not for the carcass, which might be turned to some useful\r\n  purpose, but for the unavailing satisfaction of its head? Yet are\r\n  the two cases exactly parallel? With regard to the assumption that\r\n  men are permitted to go about, at the South, with double-barrelled\r\n  guns, shooting down runaway negroes, in preference to apprehending\r\n  them, we can only say that it is as wicked and wilful as it is\r\n  ridiculous. Such Thugs there may have been as Marks and Loker, who\r\n  have killed negroes in this unprovoked manner; but, if they have\r\n  escaped the gallows, they are probably to be found within the walls\r\n  of our state penitentiaries, where they are comfortably provided for\r\n  at public expense. The laws of the Southern States, which are\r\n  designed, as in all good governments, for the protection of persons\r\n  and property, have not been so loosely framed as to fail of their\r\n  object where person and property are one.\r\n\r\n  “The law with regard to the killing of runaways is laid down with so\r\n  much clearness and precision by a South Carolina judge, that we\r\n  cannot forbear quoting his dictum, as directly in point. In the case\r\n  of Witsell _v._ Earnest and Parker, Colcock J. delivered the opinion\r\n  of the court:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jan. term, 1818 1 Nott & McCord’s S. C. Rep. 182.]\r\n\r\n  “‘By the statute of 1740, any white man may apprehend, and\r\n  moderately correct, any slave who may be found out of the plantation\r\n  at which he is employed; and if the slave assaults the white person,\r\n  he may be killed; but a slave who is merely flying away cannot be\r\n  killed. Nor can the defendants be justified by the common law, if we\r\n  consider the negro as a person; for they were not clothed with the\r\n  authority of the law to apprehend him as a felon, and without such\r\n  authority he could not be killed.’\r\n\r\n    “‘It’s commonly supposed that the _property_ interest is a\r\n    sufficient guard in these cases. If people choose to ruin their\r\n    possessions, I don’t know what’s to be done. It seems the poor\r\n    creature was a thief and a drunkard; and so there won’t be much\r\n    hope to get up sympathy for her.’\r\n\r\n    “‘It is perfectly outrageous,—it is horrid, Augustine! It will\r\n    certainly bring down vengeance upon you.’\r\n\r\n    “‘My dear cousin, I didn’t do it, and I can’t help it; I would,\r\n    if I could. If low-minded, brutal people will act like\r\n    themselves, what am I to do? _They have absolute control; they\r\n    are irresponsible despots._ There would be no use in\r\n    interfering; _there is no law, that amounts to anything\r\n    practically, for such a case_. The best we can do is to shut our\r\n    eyes and ears, and let it alone. It’s the only resource left\r\n    us.’\r\n\r\n  “In a subsequent part of the same conversation, St. Clare says:\r\n\r\n    “‘For pity’s sake, for shame’s sake, because we are men born of\r\n    women, and not savage beasts, many of us do not, and dare\r\n    not,—we would _scorn_ to use the full power which our savage\r\n    laws put into our hands. _And he who goes furthest and does the\r\n    worst only uses within limits the power that the law gives\r\n    him._’\r\n\r\n  “Mrs. Stowe tells us, through St. Clare, that ‘there is no law that\r\n  amounts to anything’ in such cases, and that he who goes furthest in\r\n  severity towards his slave,—that is, to the deprivation of an eye or\r\n  a limb, or even the destruction of life,—‘only uses within limits\r\n  the power that the law gives him.’ This is an awful and tremendous\r\n  charge, which, lightly and unwarrantably made, must subject the\r\n  maker to a fearful accountability. Let us see how the matter stands\r\n  upon the statute-book of Louisiana. By referring to the civil code\r\n  of that state, chapter 3d, article 173, the reader will find this\r\n  general declaration:\r\n\r\n  “‘The slave is entirely subject to the will of his master, who may\r\n  correct and chastise him, _though not with unusual rigor, nor so as\r\n  to maim or mutilate him, or to expose him to the danger of loss of\r\n  life, or to cause his death_.’\r\n\r\n  “On a subsequent page of the same volume and chapter, article 192,\r\n  we find provision made for the slave’s protection against his\r\n  master’s cruelty, in the statement that one of two cases, in which a\r\n  master can be compelled to sell his slave, is\r\n\r\n  “‘When the master shall be convicted of cruel treatment of his\r\n  slave, and the judge shall deem proper to pronounce, _besides the\r\n  penalty established for such cases_, that the slave shall be sold at\r\n  public auction, _in order to place him out of the reach of the power\r\n  which the master has abused_.’\r\n\r\n  “A code thus watchful of the negro’s safety in life and limb\r\n  confines not its guardianship to inhibitory clauses, but proscribes\r\n  extreme penalties in case of their infraction. In the Code Noir\r\n  (Black Code) of Louisiana, under head of Crimes and Offences, No.\r\n  55, § xvi., it is laid down, that\r\n\r\n  “‘If any person whatsoever shall wilfully kill his slave, or the\r\n  slave of another person, the said person, being convicted thereof,\r\n  shall be tried and condemned agreeably to the laws.’\r\n\r\n  “And because negro testimony is inadmissible in the courts of the\r\n  state, and therefore the evidence of such crimes might be with\r\n  difficulty supplied, it is further provided that,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Code Noir. Crimes and Offences, 56, xvii.]\r\n\r\n  “‘If any slave be mutilated, beaten or ill-treated, contrary to the\r\n  true intent and meaning of this act, when no one shall be present,\r\n  in such case the owner, or other person having the management of\r\n  said slave thus mutilated, shall be deemed responsible and guilty of\r\n  the said offence, and shall be prosecuted without further evidence,\r\n  unless the said owner, or other person so as aforesaid, can prove\r\n  the contrary by means of good and sufficient evidence, or can clear\r\n  himself by his own oath, which said oath every court, under the\r\n  cognizance of which such offence shall have been examined and tried,\r\n  is by this act authorized to administer.’\r\n\r\n  “Enough has been quoted to establish the utter falsity of the\r\n  statement, made by our authoress through St. Clare, that brutal\r\n  masters are ‘irresponsible despots,’—at least in Louisiana. It would\r\n  extend our review to a most unreasonable length, should we undertake\r\n  to give the law, with regard to the murder of slaves, as it stands\r\n  in each of the Southern States. The crime is a rare one, and\r\n  therefore the reporters have had few cases to record. We may refer,\r\n  however, to two. In _Fields v. the State of Tennessee_, the\r\n  plaintiff in error was indicted in the circuit court of Maury county\r\n  for the murder of a negro slave. He pleaded not guilty; and at the\r\n  trial was found guilty of wilful and felonious slaying of the slave.\r\n  From this sentence he prosecuted his writ of error, which was\r\n  disallowed, the court affirming the original judgment. The opinion\r\n  of the court, as given by Peck J., overflows with the spirit of\r\n  enlightened humanity. He concludes thus:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1 Yerger’s Tenn. Rep. 156.]\r\n\r\n  “‘It is well said by one of the judges of North Carolina, that the\r\n  master has a right to exact the labor of his slave; that far, the\r\n  rights of the slave are suspended; but this gives the master no\r\n  right over the life of his slave. I add to the saying of the judge,\r\n  that law which says thou shalt not kill, protects the slave; and he\r\n  is within its very letter. Law, reason, Christianity, and common\r\n  humanity, all point but one way.’\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 7 Grattan’s Rep. 673.]\r\n\r\n  “In the General Court of Virginia, June term, 1851, in _Souther v.\r\n  the Commonwealth_, it was held that ‘the killing of a slave by his\r\n  master and owner, by wilful and excessive whipping, is murder in the\r\n  first degree; _though it may not have been the purpose of the master\r\n  and owner to kill the slave_.’ The writer shows, also, an ignorance\r\n  of the law of contracts, as it affects slavery in the South, in\r\n  making George’s master take him from the factory against the\r\n  proprietor’s consent. George, by virtue of the contract of hiring,\r\n  had become the property of the proprietor for the time being, and\r\n  his master could no more have taken him away forcibly than the owner\r\n  of a house in Massachusetts can dispossess his lessee, at any\r\n  moment, from mere whim or caprice. There is no court in Kentucky\r\n  where the hirer’s rights, in this regard, would not be enforced.\r\n\r\n    “‘No. Father bought her once, in one of his trips to New\r\n    Orleans, and brought her up as a present to mother. She was\r\n    about eight or nine years old, then. Father would never tell\r\n    mother what he gave for her; but, the other day, in looking over\r\n    his old papers, we came across the bill of sale. He paid an\r\n    extravagant sum for her, to be sure. I suppose, on account of\r\n    her extraordinary beauty.’\r\n\r\n    “George sat with his back to Cassy, and did not see the absorbed\r\n    expression of her countenance, as he was giving these details.\r\n\r\n    “At this point in the story, she touched his arm, and, with a\r\n    face perfectly white with interest, said, ‘Do you know the names\r\n    of the people he bought her of?’\r\n\r\n    “‘A man of the name of Simmons, I think, was the principal in\r\n    the transaction. At least, I think that was the name in the bill\r\n    of sale.’\r\n\r\n    “‘O, my God!’ said Cassy, and fell insensible on the floor of\r\n    the cabin.”\r\n\r\n  “Of course Eliza turns out to be Cassy’s child, and we are soon\r\n  entertained with the family meeting in Montreal, where George Harris\r\n  is living, five or six years after the opening of the story, in\r\n  great comfort.\r\n\r\n  “Now, the reader will perhaps be surprised to know that such an\r\n  incident as the sale of Cassy apart from Eliza, upon which the whole\r\n  interest of the foregoing narrative hinges, never could have taken\r\n  place in Louisiana, and that the bill of sale for Eliza would not\r\n  have been worth the paper it was written on. Observe. George Shelby\r\n  states that Eliza was _eight or nine years old_ at the time his\r\n  father purchased her in New Orleans. Let us again look at the\r\n  statute-book of Louisiana.\r\n\r\n  “In the _Code Noir_ we find it set down that\r\n\r\n  “‘Every person is expressly prohibited from selling separately from\r\n  their mothers _the children who shall not have attained the full age\r\n  of ten years_.’\r\n\r\n  “And this humane provision is strengthened by a statute, one clause\r\n  of which runs as follows:\r\n\r\n  “‘Be it further enacted, That if any person or persons shall sell\r\n  the mother of any slave child or children _under the age of ten\r\n  years, separate from said child or children, or shall, the mother\r\n  living, sell any slave child or children of ten years of age, or\r\n  under, separate from said mother_, such person or persons shall\r\n  incur the penalty of the sixth section of this act.’\r\n\r\n  “This penalty is a fine of not less than one thousand nor more than\r\n  two thousand dollars, and imprisonment in the public jail for a\r\n  period of not less than six months nor more than one year.—_Vide\r\n  Acts of Louisiana, 1 Session, 9th Legislature_, 1828, 1829, No. 24,\r\n  Section 16.”\r\n\r\nThe author makes here a remark. Scattered through all the Southern\r\nStates are slaveholders who are such only in name. They have no pleasure\r\nin the system, they consider it one of wrong altogether, and they hold\r\nthe legal relation still, only because not yet clear with regard to the\r\nbest way of changing it, so as to better the condition of those held.\r\nSuch are most earnest advocates for state emancipation, and are friends\r\nof anything, written in a right spirit, which tends in that direction.\r\nFrom such the author ever receives criticisms with pleasure.\r\n\r\nShe has endeavored to lay before the world, in the fullest manner, all\r\nthat can be objected to her work, that both sides may have an\r\nopportunity of impartial hearing.\r\n\r\nWhen writing “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” though entirely unaware and\r\nunexpectant of the importance which would be attached to its statements\r\nand opinions, the author of that work was anxious, from love of\r\nconsistency, to have some understanding of the laws of the slave system.\r\nShe had on hand for reference, while writing, the Code Noir of\r\nLouisiana, and a sketch of the laws relating to slavery in the different\r\nstates, by Judge Stroud, of Philadelphia. This work, professing to have\r\nbeen compiled with great care from the latest editions of the\r\nstatute-books of the several states, the author supposed to be a\r\nsufficient guide for the writing of a work of fiction.[3] As the\r\naccuracy of those statements which relate to the slave-laws has been\r\nparticularly contested, a more especial inquiry has been made in this\r\ndirection. Under the guidance and with the assistance of legal gentlemen\r\nof high standing, the writer has proceeded to examine the statements of\r\nJudge Stroud with regard to statute-law, and to follow them up with some\r\ninquiry into the decisions of courts. The result has been an increasing\r\nconviction on her part that the impressions first derived from Judge\r\nStroud’s work were correct; and the author now can only give the words\r\nof St. Clare, as the best possible expression of the sentiments and\r\nopinion which this course of reading has awakened in her mind.\r\n\r\n  This cursed business, accursed of God and man,—what is it? Strip it\r\n  of all its ornament, run it down to the root and nucleus of the\r\n  whole, and what is it? Why, because my brother Quashy is ignorant\r\n  and weak, and I am intelligent and strong,—because I know how, and\r\n  _can_ do it,—therefore I may steal all he has, keep it, and give him\r\n  only such and so much as suits my fancy! Whatever is too hard, too\r\n  dirty, too disagreeable for me, I may set Quashy to doing. Because I\r\n  don’t like work, Quashy shall work. Because the sun burns me, Quashy\r\n  shall stay in the sun. Quashy shall earn the money, and I will spend\r\n  it. Quashy shall lie down in every puddle, that I may walk over dry\r\n  shod. Quashy shall do my will, and not his, all the days of his\r\n  mortal life, and have such a chance of getting to heaven at last as\r\n  I find convenient. This I take to be about what slavery is. I defy\r\n  anybody on earth to read our slave-code, as it stands in our\r\n  law-books, and make anything else of it. Talk of the _abuses_ of\r\n  slavery! Humbug! The _thing itself_ is the essence of all abuse. And\r\n  the only reason why the land don’t sink under it, like Sodom and\r\n  Gomorrah, is because it is _used_ in a way infinitely better than it\r\n  is. For pity’s sake, for shame’s sake, because we are men born of\r\n  women, and not savage beasts, many of us do not, and dare not,—we\r\n  would _scorn_ to use the full power which our savage laws put into\r\n  our hands. And he who goes the furthest, and does the worst, only\r\n  uses within limits the power that the law gives him!\r\n\r\nThe author still holds to the opinion that slavery in itself, as legally\r\ndefined in law-books and expressed in the records of courts, _is_ the\r\nSUM AND ESSENCE OF ALL ABUSE; and she still clings to the hope that\r\nthere are _many_ men at the South _infinitely_ better than their laws;\r\nand after the reader has read all the extracts which she has to make,\r\nfor the sake of a common humanity they will hope the same. The author\r\nmust state, with regard to some passages which she must quote, that the\r\nlanguage of certain enactments was so incredible that she would not take\r\nit on the authority of any compilation whatever, but copied it with her\r\nown hand from the latest edition of the statute-book where it stood and\r\nstill stands.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  In this connection it may be well to state that the work of Judge\r\n  Stroud is now out of print, but that a work of the same character is\r\n  in course of preparation by William I. Bowditch, Esq., of Boston,\r\n  which will bring the subject out, by the assistance of the latest\r\n  editions of statutes, and the most recent decisions of courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                            WHAT IS SLAVERY?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author will now enter into a consideration of slavery as it stands\r\nrevealed in slave law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil Code, Art. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2 Brev. Dig. 229. Prince’s Digest, 446.]\r\n\r\nWhat is it, according to the definition of law-books and of legal\r\ninterpreters? “A slave,” says the law of Louisiana, “is one who is in\r\nthe power of a master, to whom he belongs. The master may sell him,\r\ndispose of his person, his industry and his labor; he can do nothing,\r\npossess nothing, nor acquire anything, but what must belong to his\r\nmaster.” South Carolina says “slaves shall be deemed, sold, taken,\r\nreputed and adjudged in law, to be chattels personal in the hands of\r\ntheir owners and possessors, and their executors, administrators, and\r\nassigns, TO ALL INTENTS, CONSTRUCTIONS AND PURPOSES WHATSOEVER.” The law\r\nof Georgia is similar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wheeler’s Law of Slavery, 246. State _v._ Mann.]\r\n\r\nLet the reader reflect on the extent of the meaning in this last clause.\r\nJudge Ruffin, pronouncing the opinion of the Supreme Court of North\r\nCarolina, says, a slave is “one doomed in his own person, and his\r\nposterity, to live without knowledge, and without the capacity to make\r\nanything his own, and to toil that another may reap the fruits.”\r\n\r\nThis is what slavery _is_,—this is what it is to be a slave! The\r\nslave-code, then, of the Southern States, is designed to keep millions\r\nof human beings in the condition of chattels personal; to keep them in a\r\ncondition in which the master may sell them, dispose of their time,\r\nperson and labor; in which they can do nothing, possess nothing, and\r\nacquire nothing, except for the benefit of the master; in which they are\r\ndoomed in themselves and in their posterity to live without knowledge,\r\nwithout the power to make anything their own,—to toil that another may\r\nreap. The laws of the slave-code are designed to work out this problem,\r\nconsistently with the peace of the community, and the safety of that\r\nsuperior race which is constantly to perpetrate this outrage.\r\n\r\nFrom this simple statement of what the laws of slavery are designed to\r\ndo,—from a consideration that the class thus to be reduced, and\r\noppressed, and made the subjects of a perpetual robbery, are _men_ of\r\nlike passions with our own, men originally made in the image of God as\r\nmuch as ourselves, men partakers of that same humanity of which Jesus\r\nChrist is the highest ideal and expression,—when we consider that the\r\nmaterial thus to be acted upon is that fearfully explosive element, the\r\nsoul of man; that soul elastic, upspringing, immortal, whose free will\r\neven the Omnipotence of God refuses to coerce,—we may form some idea of\r\nthe tremendous force which is necessary to keep this mightiest of\r\nelements in the state of repression which is contemplated in the\r\ndefinition of slavery.\r\n\r\nOf course, the system necessary to consummate and perpetuate such a\r\nwork, from age to age, must be a fearfully stringent one; and our\r\nreaders will find that it is so. Men who make the laws, and men who\r\ninterpret them, may be fully sensible of their terrible severity and\r\ninhumanity; but, if they are going to preserve the THING, they have no\r\nresource but to make the laws, and to execute them faithfully after they\r\nare made. They may say, with the honorable Judge Ruffin, of North\r\nCarolina, when solemnly from the bench announcing this great foundation\r\nprinciple of slavery, that “THE POWER OF THE MASTER MUST BE ABSOLUTE, TO\r\nRENDER THE SUBMISSION OF THE SLAVE PERFECT,”—they may say, with him, “I\r\nmost freely confess my sense of the harshness of this proposition; I\r\nfeel it as deeply as any man can; and, as a principle of moral right,\r\nevery person in his retirement must repudiate it;”—but they will also be\r\nobliged to add, with him, “But, in the _actual condition_ of things, it\r\nMUST BE SO. * * This discipline belongs to the state of slavery. * * *\r\nIt is INHERENT in the relation of master and slave.”\r\n\r\nAnd, like Judge Ruffin, men of honor, men of humanity, men of kindest\r\nand gentlest feelings, are _obliged_ to interpret these severe laws with\r\ninflexible severity. In the perpetual reaction of that awful force of\r\nhuman passion and human will, which necessarily meets the compressive\r\npower of slavery,—in that seething, boiling tide, never wholly\r\nrepressed, which rolls its volcanic stream underneath the whole\r\nframe-work of society so constituted, ready to find vent at the least\r\nrent or fissure or unguarded aperture,—there is a constant necessity\r\nwhich urges to severity of law and inflexibility of execution. So Judge\r\nRuffin says, “We cannot allow the _right_ of the matter to be brought\r\ninto discussion in the courts of justice. The slave, to remain a slave,\r\nmust be made sensible that there is NO APPEAL FROM HIS MASTER.”\r\nAccordingly, we find in the more southern states, where the slave\r\npopulation is most accumulated, and slave property most necessary and\r\nvaluable, and, of course, the determination to abide by the system the\r\nmost decided, _there_ the enactments are most severe, and the\r\ninterpretation of courts the most inflexible.[4] And, when legal\r\ndecisions of a contrary character begin to be made, it would appear that\r\nit is a symptom of leaning towards emancipation. So abhorrent is the\r\nslave-code to every feeling of humanity, that just as soon as there is\r\nany hesitancy in the community about perpetuating the institution of\r\nslavery, judges begin to listen to the voice of their more honorable\r\nnature, and by favorable interpretations to soften its necessary\r\nseverities.\r\n\r\nSuch decisions do not commend themselves to the professional admiration\r\nof legal gentlemen. But in the workings of the slave system, when the\r\nirresponsible power which it guarantees comes to be used by men of the\r\nmost brutal nature, cases sometimes arise for trial where the consistent\r\nexposition of the law involves results so loathsome and frightful, that\r\nthe judge prefers to be illogical, rather than inhuman. Like a spring\r\noutgushing in the desert, some noble man, now and then, from the fulness\r\nof his own better nature, throws out a legal decision, generously\r\ninconsistent with every principle and precedent of slave jurisprudence,\r\nand we bless God for it. All we wish is that there were more of them,\r\nfor then should we hope that the day of redemption was drawing nigh.\r\n\r\nThe reader is now prepared to enter with us on the proof of this\r\nproposition: That the slave-code is designed _only for the security of\r\nthe master, and not with regard to the welfare of the slave_.\r\n\r\nThis is implied in the whole current of law-making and\r\nlaw-administration, and is often asserted in distinct form, with a\r\nprecision and clearness of legal accuracy which, in a literary point of\r\nview, are quite admirable. Thus, Judge Ruffin, after stating that\r\nconsiderations restricting the power of the master had often been drawn\r\nfrom a comparison of slavery with the relation of parent and child,\r\nmaster and apprentice, tutor and pupil, says distinctly:\r\n\r\n  The court does not recognize their application. There is no likeness\r\n  between the cases. They are in opposition to each other, and there\r\n  is an impassable gulf between them. * * * *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wheeler’s Law of Slavery, page 246.]\r\n\r\n  In the one [case], the end in view is the _happiness of the youth_,\r\n  born to equal rights with that governor, on whom the duty devolves\r\n  of training the young to usefulness, in a station which he is\r\n  afterwards to assume among freemen. * * * * With slavery it is far\r\n  otherwise. The _end is the profit of the master_, his security and\r\n  the public safety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wheeler’s Law of Slavery, p. 239.]\r\n\r\nNot only is this principle distinctly asserted in so many words, but it\r\nis more distinctly implied in multitudes of the arguings and reasonings\r\nwhich are given as grounds of legal decisions. Even such provisions as\r\nseem to be for the benefit of the slave we often find carefully\r\ninterpreted so as to show that it is only on account of his property\r\nvalue to his master that he is thus protected, and not from any\r\nconsideration of humanity towards himself. Thus it has been decided that\r\na master can bring no action for assault and battery on his slave,\r\n_unless the injury be such as to produce a loss of service_.\r\n\r\nThe spirit in which this question is discussed is worthy of remark. We\r\ngive a brief statement of the case, as presented in Wheeler, p. 239.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cornfute _v._ Dale, April Term, 1800. 1 Har. & Johns. Rep. 4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2 Lutw. 1481; 20 Viner’s Abr. 454.]\r\n\r\nIt was an action for assault and battery committed by Dale on one\r\nCornfute’s slave. It was contended by Cornfute’s counsel that it was not\r\nnecessary to _prove loss of service_, in order that the action should be\r\nsustained; that an action might be supported for beating plaintiff’s\r\n_horse_; and that the lord might have an action for the battery of his\r\nvillein, which is founded on this principle, that, as the villein could\r\nnot support the action, _the injury would be without redress, unless the\r\nlord could_. On the other side it was said that Lord Chief Justice\r\nRaymond had decided that an assault on a horse was no cause of action,\r\nunless accompanied with _a special damage of the animal_, which would\r\nimpair his value.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Chase decided that no redress could be obtained in the\r\ncase, because the value of the slave had not been impaired, and _without\r\ninjury or wrong to the master_ no action could be sustained; and\r\nassigned this among other reasons for it, that there was no reciprocity\r\nin the case, as the master was not liable for assault and battery\r\ncommitted by his slave, neither could he gain redress for one committed\r\nupon his slave.\r\n\r\nLet any reader now imagine what an amount of wanton cruelty and\r\nindignity may be heaped upon a slave man or woman or child without\r\nactually impairing their power to do service to the master, and he will\r\nhave a full sense of the cruelty of this decision.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tate _v._ O’Neal, 1 Hawks, 418. U. S. Dig. Sup. 2, p. 797, §\r\n           121.]\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit it has been held in North Carolina that patrols\r\n(night watchmen) are not liable to the master for inflicting punishment\r\non the slave, unless their conduct clearly demonstrates _malice against\r\nthe master_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: State _v._ Maner, 2 Hill’s Rep. 453. Wheeler’s Law of\r\n           Slavery, page 243.]\r\n\r\nThe cool-bloodedness of some of these legal discussions is forcibly\r\nshown by two decisions in Wheeler’s Law of Slavery, p. 243. On the\r\nquestion whether the criminal offence of assault and battery can be\r\ncommitted on a slave, there are two decisions of the two States of South\r\nand North Carolina; and it is difficult to say which of these decisions\r\nhas the preëminence for cool legal inhumanity. That of South Carolina\r\nreads thus.\r\n\r\nJudge O’Neill says:\r\n\r\n  The criminal offence of assault and battery can not, at common law,\r\n  be committed upon the person of a slave. For notwithstanding (for\r\n  some purposes) a slave is regarded by law as a _person_, yet\r\n  generally he is a mere chattel personal, and his right of personal\r\n  protection belongs to his master, who can maintain an action of\r\n  trespass for the battery of his slave. There can be therefore no\r\n  offence against the state for a _mere beating of a slave\r\n  unaccompanied with any circumstances of cruelty_ (!!), or an attempt\r\n  to kill and murder. The peace of the state _is not thereby broken_;\r\n  for a slave is not generally regarded as legally capable of being\r\n  within the peace of the state. He is not a citizen, and is not in\r\n  that character entitled to her protection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: See State _v._ Hale. Wheeler, p. 239. 2 Hawk. N. C. Rep.\r\n           582.]\r\n\r\nWhat declaration of the utter indifference of the state to the\r\nsufferings of the slave could be more elegantly cool and clear? But in\r\nNorth Carolina it appears that the case is argued still more\r\nelaborately.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Taylor thus shows that, after all, there are reasons why\r\nan assault and battery upon the slave may, on the whole, have some such\r\ngeneral connection with the comfort and security of the community, that\r\nit may be construed into a breach of the peace, and should be treated as\r\nan indictable offence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1 Rev. Code 448.]\r\n\r\n  The instinct of a slave may be, and generally is, tamed into\r\n  subservience to his master’s will, and from him he receives\r\n  chastisement, whether it be merited or not, with perfect submission;\r\n  for he knows the extent of the dominion assumed over him, and that\r\n  the law ratifies the claim. But when the same authority is wantonly\r\n  usurped by a stranger, nature is disposed to assert her rights, and\r\n  to prompt the slave to a resistance, often momentarily successful,\r\n  sometimes fatally so. The public peace is thus broken, as much as if\r\n  a free man had been beaten; for the party of the aggressor is always\r\n  the strongest, and such contests usually terminate by overpowering\r\n  the slave, and inflicting on him a severe chastisement, without\r\n  regard to the original cause of the conflict. There is,\r\n  consequently, as much reason for making such offences indictable as\r\n  if a white man had been the victim. A wanton injury committed on a\r\n  slave _is a great provocation to the owner, awakens his resentment,\r\n  and has a direct tendency to a breach of the peace, by inciting him\r\n  to seek immediate vengeance_. If resented in the heat of blood, it\r\n  would probably extenuate a homicide to manslaughter, upon the same\r\n  principle with the case stated by Lord Hale, that if A riding on the\r\n  road, B had whipped his horse out of the track, and then A had\r\n  alighted and killed B. These offences are usually committed by men\r\n  of dissolute habits, hanging loose upon society, _who, being\r\n  repelled from association with well-disposed citizens, take refuge\r\n  in the company of colored persons and slaves, whom they deprave by\r\n  their example, embolden by their familiarity, and then beat, under\r\n  the expectation that a slave dare not resent a blow from a white\r\n  man_. If such offences may be committed with impunity, the public\r\n  peace will not only be rendered extremely insecure, but _the value\r\n  of slave property must be much impaired_, for the offenders can\r\n  seldom make any reparation in damages. Nor is it necessary, in any\r\n  case, that a person who has received an injury, real or imaginary,\r\n  from a slave, should carve out his own justice; _for the law has\r\n  made ample and summary provision for the punishment of all trivial\r\n  offences committed by slaves, by carrying them before a justice, who\r\n  is authorized to pass sentence for their being publicly whipped_.\r\n  This provision, while it excludes the necessity of private\r\n  vengeance, would seem to forbid its legality, since it effectually\r\n  protects all persons from the insolence of slaves, even where their\r\n  masters are unwilling to correct them upon complaint being made. The\r\n  common law has often been called into efficient operation, for the\r\n  punishment of public cruelty inflicted _upon animals_, for needless\r\n  and wanton barbarity exercised even by masters upon their slaves,\r\n  and for various violations of _decency, morals, and comfort_. Reason\r\n  and analogy seem to require that a human being, _although the\r\n  subject of property_, should be _so far protected as the public\r\n  might be injured through him_.\r\n\r\n  For all purposes necessary to enforce the obedience of the slave,\r\n  and to render him useful as property, the law secures to the master\r\n  a complete authority over him, and it will not lightly interfere\r\n  with the relation thus established. _It is a more effectual\r\n  guarantee of his right of property, when the slave is protected from\r\n  wanton abuse from those who have no power over him_; for it cannot\r\n  be disputed that a slave is rendered less capable of performing his\r\n  master’s service when he finds himself exposed by the law to the\r\n  capricious violence of every turbulent man in the community.\r\n\r\nIf this is not a scrupulous disclaimer of all humane intention in the\r\ndecision, as far as the slave is concerned, and an explicit declaration\r\nthat he is protected only out of regard to the comfort of the community,\r\nand his property value to his master, it is difficult to see how such a\r\ndeclaration could be made. After all this cool-blooded course of remark,\r\nit is somewhat curious to come upon the following certainly most\r\nunexpected declaration, which occurs in the very next paragraph:\r\n\r\n  Mitigated as slavery is by the _humanity of our laws_, the\r\n  refinement of manners, and by _public opinion, which revolts at\r\n  every instance of cruelty towards_ them, it would be an anomaly in\r\n  the system of police which affects them, if the offence stated in\r\n  the verdict were not indictable.\r\n\r\nThe reader will please to notice that this remarkable declaration is\r\nmade of the State of North Carolina. We shall have occasion again to\r\nrefer to it by and by, when we extract from the statute-book of North\r\nCarolina some specimens of these humane laws.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jourdain _v._ Patton, July term, 1818. 5 Martin’s Louis Rep.\r\n           615.]\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit it is decided, under the law of Louisiana, that if an\r\nindividual injures another’s slave so as to make him _entirely useless_,\r\nand the owner recovers from him the full value of the slave, the slave\r\nby that act becomes thenceforth the property of the person who injured\r\nhim. A decision to this effect is given in Wheeler’s Law of Slavery, p.\r\n249. A woman sued for an injury done to her slave by the slave of the\r\ndefendant. The injury was such as to render him entirely useless, his\r\n_only_ eye being put out. The parish court decreed that she should\r\nrecover twelve hundred dollars, that the defendant should pay a further\r\nsum of twenty-five dollars a month from the time of the injury; also the\r\nphysician’s bill, and two hundred dollars for the sustenance of the\r\nslave during his life, and that he should remain forever in the\r\npossession of his mistress.\r\n\r\nThe case was appealed. The judge reversed the decision, and delivered\r\nthe slave into the possession of the man whose slave had committed the\r\noutrage. In the course of the decision, the judge remarks, with that\r\ncalm legal explicitness for which many decisions of this kind are\r\nremarkable, that\r\n\r\n  The principle of humanity, which would lead us to suppose that the\r\n  mistress, whom he had long served, would treat her miserable blind\r\n  slave with more kindness than the defendant, to whom the judgment\r\n  ought to transfer him, cannot be taken into consideration in\r\n  deciding this case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jan. term, 1828. 9 Martin La. Rep. 350.]\r\n\r\nAnother case, reported in Wheeler’s Law, page 198, the author thus\r\nsummarily abridges. It is Dorothee _v._ Coquillon _et al._ A young girl,\r\nby will of her mistress, was to have her freedom at twenty-one; and it\r\nwas required by the will that in the mean time she should be educated in\r\nsuch a manner as to enable her to earn her living when free, her\r\nservices in the mean time being bequeathed to the daughter of the\r\ndefendant. Her mother (a free woman) entered complaint that no care was\r\ntaken of the child’s education, and that she was cruelly treated. The\r\nprayer of the petition was that the child be declared free at\r\ntwenty-one, and in the mean time hired out by the sheriff. The suit was\r\ndecided against the mother, on this ground,—that she could not sue _for_\r\nher daughter in a case where the daughter could not sue for herself were\r\nshe of age,—the object of the suit being _relief from ill-treatment\r\nduring the time of her slavery, which a slave cannot sue for_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jan. term, 1827. 4 M’Cord’s Rep. 161. Wheeler’s Law of\r\n           Slavery, p. 201.]\r\n\r\nObserve, now, the following case of Jennings _v._ Fundeberg. It seems\r\nJennings brings an action of trespass against Fundeberg for killing his\r\nslave. The case was thus: Fundeberg with others, being out hunting\r\nrunaway negroes, surprised them in their camp, and, as the report says,\r\n“_fired his gun towards them_ as they were running away, _to induce them\r\nto stop_.” One of them, being shot through the head, was thus _induced\r\nto stop_,—and the master of the boy brought action for trespass against\r\nthe firer for killing his slave.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the inferior court was as follows:\r\n\r\nThe court “thought the killing accidental, and that the defendant ought\r\nnot to be made answerable as a trespasser.” * * * *\r\n\r\n“When one is lawfully interfering with the property of another, and\r\naccidentally destroys it, he is no trespasser, and ought not to be\r\nanswerable for the value of the property. In this case, the defendant\r\nwas engaged in a lawful and _meritorious_ service, and if he really\r\nfired his gun in the manner stated it was an allowable act.”\r\n\r\nThe superior judge reversed the decision, on the ground that in dealing\r\nwith another person’s property one is responsible for any injury which\r\nhe could have avoided by any degree of circumspection. “The firing ...\r\nwas _rash_ and _incautious_.”\r\n\r\nDoes not the whole spirit of this discussion speak for itself?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jan. T. 1827. 4 M’Cord’s Rep. 156.]\r\n\r\nSee also the very next case in Wheeler’s Law. Richardson _v._ Dukes, p.\r\n202.\r\n\r\n  Trespass for killing the plaintiff’s slave. It appeared the slave\r\n  was stealing potatoes from a bank near the defendant’s house. The\r\n  defendant fired upon him with a gun loaded with buckshot, and killed\r\n  him. The jury found a verdict for plaintiff for one dollar. Motion\r\n  for a new trial.\r\n\r\n  _The Court._ _Nott_ J. held, there must be a new trial; that the\r\n  jury ought to have given the plaintiff the value of the slave. That\r\n  if the jury were of opinion the slave was of bad character, some\r\n  deduction from the usual price ought to be made, but the plaintiff\r\n  was certainly entitled to his actual damage for killing his slave.\r\n  Where property is in question, the value of the article, as nearly\r\n  as it can be ascertained, furnishes a rule from which they are not\r\n  at liberty to depart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wheeler’s Law of Slavery, 220.]\r\n\r\nIt seems that the value of this unfortunate piece of property was\r\nsomewhat reduced from the circumstance of his “stealing potatoes.”\r\nDoubtless he had his own best reasons for this; so, at least, we should\r\ninfer from the following remark, which occurs in one of the reasonings\r\nof Judge Taylor, of N. Carolina.\r\n\r\n  “The act of 1786 (Iredell’s Revisal, p. 588) does, in the preamble,\r\n  recognize the fact, that many persons, _by cruel treatment to their\r\n  slaves, cause_ them to commit crimes for which they are executed.\r\n  * * The cruel treatment here alluded to must consist in _withholding\r\n  from them the necessaries of life_; and the crimes thus resulting\r\n  are such as are calculated to _furnish them with food and raiment_.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps “stealing potatoes” in this case was one of the class of crimes\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Witsell _v._ Earnest & Parker. Wheeler, p. 202.]\r\n\r\nAgain we have the following case:\r\n\r\n  The defendants went to the plantation of Mrs. Witsell for the\r\n  purpose of hunting for runaway negroes; there being many in the\r\n  neighborhood, and the place in considerable alarm. As they\r\n  approached the house with loaded guns, a negro ran from the house,\r\n  or near the house, towards a swamp, when they fired and killed him.\r\n\r\n  The judge charged the jury, that such circumstances might exist, by\r\n  the excitement and alarm of the neighborhood, as to authorize the\r\n  killing of a negro without the sanction of a magistrate.\r\n\r\nThis decision was reversed in the Superior Court, in the following\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n  By the statute of 1740, any white man may apprehend and moderately\r\n  correct any slave who may be found out of the plantation at which he\r\n  is employed, and if the slave assaults the white person, _he may be\r\n  killed_; but a slave who is merely flying away cannot be killed. Nor\r\n  can the defendants be justified by common law, IF _we consider the\r\n  negro as a person_; for they were not clothed with the authority of\r\n  the law to apprehend him as a felon, and without such authority he\r\n  could not be killed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wheeler, p. 252. June T., 1820. Walker’s Rep. 83.]\r\n\r\nIF _we consider the negro a person_, says the judge; and, from his\r\ndecision in the case, he evidently intimates that he has a strong\r\nleaning to this opinion, though it has been contested by so many eminent\r\nlegal authorities that he puts forth his sentiment modestly, and in an\r\nhypothetical form. The reader, perhaps, will need to be informed that\r\nthe question whether the slave is to be considered a person or a human\r\nbeing in any respect has been extensively and ably argued on both sides\r\nin legal courts, and it may be a comfort to know that the balance of\r\nlegal opinion inclines in favor of the slave. Judge Clarke, of\r\nMississippi, is quite clear on the point, and argues very ably and\r\nearnestly, though, as he confesses, against very respectable legal\r\nauthorities, that the slave _is_ a person,—that he _is_ a reasonable\r\ncreature. The reasoning occurs in the case State of Mississippi _v._\r\nJones, and is worthy of attention as a literary curiosity.\r\n\r\nIt seems that a case of murder of a slave had been clearly made out and\r\nproved in the lower court, and that judgment was arrested and the case\r\nappealed on the ground whether, in that state, murder could be committed\r\non a slave. Judge Clarke thus ably and earnestly argues:\r\n\r\n  The question in this case is, whether murder can be committed on a\r\n  slave. Because individuals may have been deprived of many of their\r\n  rights by society, it does not follow, that they have been deprived\r\n  of all their rights. In some respects, slaves may be considered as\r\n  chattels; but in others, they are regarded as men. The law views\r\n  them as capable of committing crimes. This can only be upon the\r\n  principle, that they are _men_ and rational beings. The Roman law\r\n  has been much relied on by the counsel of the defendant. That law\r\n  was confined to the Roman empire, giving the power of life and death\r\n  over captives in war, as slaves; but it no more extended here, than\r\n  the similar power given to parents over the lives of their children.\r\n  Much stress has also been laid by the defendant’s counsel on the\r\n  case cited from Taylor’s Reports, decided in North Carolina; yet, in\r\n  that case, two judges against one were of opinion, that killing a\r\n  slave was murder. Judge Hall, who delivered the dissenting opinion\r\n  in the above case based his conclusions, as we conceive, upon\r\n  erroneous principles, by considering the laws of Rome applicable\r\n  here. His inference, also, that a person cannot be condemned\r\n  capitally, because he may be liable in a civil action, is not\r\n  sustained by reason or authority, but appears to us to be in direct\r\n  opposition to both. At a very early period in Virginia, the power of\r\n  life over slaves was given by statute; but Tucker observes, that as\r\n  soon as these statutes were repealed, it was at once considered by\r\n  their courts that the killing of a slave might be murder.\r\n  Commonwealth _v._ Dolly Chapman: indictment for maliciously stabbing\r\n  a slave, under a statute. It has been determined in Virginia that\r\n  slaves are persons. In the constitution of the United States, slaves\r\n  are expressly designated as “persons.” In this state the legislature\r\n  have considered slaves as reasonable and accountable beings; and it\r\n  would be a stigma upon the character of the state, and a reproach to\r\n  the administration of justice, if the life of a slave could be taken\r\n  with impunity, or if he could be murdered in cold blood, without\r\n  subjecting the offender to the highest penalty known to the criminal\r\n  jurisprudence of the country. Has the slave no rights, because he is\r\n  deprived of his freedom? He is still a human being, and possesses\r\n  all those rights of which he is not _deprived by the positive\r\n  provisions of the law_; but in vain shall we look for any law passed\r\n  by the enlightened and philanthropic legislature of this state,\r\n  giving even to the master, much less to a stranger, power over the\r\n  life of a slave. Such a statute would be worthy the age of Draco or\r\n  Caligula, and would be condemned by the unanimous voice of the\r\n  people of this state, where even cruelty to slaves, much [more] the\r\n  taking away of life, meets with universal reprobation. By the\r\n  provisions of our law, a slave may commit murder, and be punished\r\n  with death; why, then, is it not murder to kill a slave? Can a mere\r\n  chattel commit murder, and be subject to punishment?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _The right of the master exists not by force of the law of nature or\r\n  nations, but by virtue only of the positive law of the state_; and\r\n  although that gives to the master the right to command the services\r\n  of the slave, requiring the master to feed and clothe the slave from\r\n  infancy till death, yet it gives the master no right to take the\r\n  life of the slave; and, if the offence be not murder, it is not a\r\n  crime, and subjects the offender to no punishment.\r\n\r\n  The taking away the life of a reasonable creature, under the king’s\r\n  peace, with malice aforethought, express or implied, is murder at\r\n  common law. Is not a slave a reasonable creature?—is he not a human\r\n  being? And the meaning of this phrase, _reasonable creature_, is, a\r\n  human being. For the killing a lunatic, an idiot, or even a child\r\n  unborn, is murder, as much as the killing a philosopher; and has not\r\n  the slave as much reason as a lunatic, an idiot, or an unborn child?\r\n\r\nThus triumphantly, in this nineteenth century of the Christian era and\r\nin the State of Mississippi, has it been made to appear that the slave\r\nis a reasonable creature,—a human being!\r\n\r\nWhat sort of system, what sort of a public sentiment, was that which\r\nmade this argument _necessary_?\r\n\r\nAnd let us look at some of the admissions of this argument with regard\r\nto the _nature_ of slavery. According to the judge, it is depriving\r\nhuman beings of _many of their rights_. Thus he says: “Because\r\nindividuals may have been deprived of many of their rights by society,\r\nit does not follow that they have been deprived of _all_ their rights.”\r\nAgain, he says of the slave: “He is still a human being, and possesses\r\nall those _rights_ of which he is not deprived by the _positive\r\nprovisions of the law_.” Here he admits that the provisions of law\r\ndeprive the slave of natural _rights_. Again he says: “The right of the\r\nmaster exists not by force of the law of nature or of nations, but by\r\nvirtue only of the positive law of the state.” According to the decision\r\nof this judge, therefore, slavery exists by the same right that robbery\r\nor oppression of any kind does,—the right of _ability_. A gang of\r\nrobbers associated into a society have rights over all the neighboring\r\nproperty that they can acquire, of precisely the same kind.\r\n\r\nWith the same unconscious serenity does the law apply that principle of\r\nforce and robbery which is the essence of slavery, and show how far the\r\nmaster may proceed in appropriating another human being as his property.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wheeler, p. 28. Banks, Adm’r, _v._ Marksbury. Spring T. 1823.\r\n           3 Little’s Rep. 275.]\r\n\r\nThe question arises, May a master give a woman to one person, and her\r\n_unborn children_ to another one? Let us hear the case argued. The\r\nunfortunate mother selected as the test point of this interesting legal\r\nprinciple comes to our view in the will of one Samuel Marksbury, under\r\nthe style and denomination of “my negro wench Pen.” Said Samuel states\r\nin his will that, for the good will and love he bears to his _own_\r\nchildren, he gives said negro wench Pen to son Samuel, and all her\r\nfuture increase to daughter Rachael. When daughter Rachael, therefore,\r\nmarries, her husband sets up a claim for this increase,—as it is stated,\r\nquite off-hand, that the “wench had several children.” Here comes a\r\nbeautifully interesting case, quite stimulating to legal acumen.\r\nInferior court decides that Samuel Marksbury could not have given away\r\nunborn children on the strength of the legal maxim, “_Nemo dat quod non\r\nhabet_,”—i. e., “Nobody can give what he has not got,”—which certainly\r\none should think sensible and satisfactory enough. The case, however, is\r\nappealed, and reversed in the superior court; and now let us hear the\r\nreasoning.\r\n\r\nThe judge acknowledges the force of the maxim above quoted,—says, as one\r\nwould think any man might say, that it is quite a correct maxim,—the\r\nonly difficulty being that it does not at all apply to the present case.\r\nLet us hear him:\r\n\r\n  He who is the absolute owner of a _thing_ owns all its faculties for\r\n  profit or increase; and he may, no doubt, grant the profits or\r\n  increase, as well as the _thing_ itself. Thus, it is every day’s\r\n  practice to grant the future rents or profits of real estate; and it\r\n  is held that a man may grant the wool of a flock of sheep for years.\r\n\r\nSee also p. 33, Fanny _v._ Bryant, 4 J. J. Marshall’s Rep., 368. In this\r\nalmost precisely the same language is used. If the reader will proceed,\r\nhe will find also this principle applied with equal clearness to the\r\nhiring, selling, mortgaging of unborn children; and the perfect legal\r\nnonchalance of these discussions is only comparable to running a\r\ndissecting-knife through the course of all the heart-strings of a living\r\nsubject, for the purpose of demonstrating the laws of nervous\r\ncontraction.\r\n\r\nJudge Stroud, in his sketch of the slave-laws, page 99, lays down for\r\nproof the following assertion: That the penal codes of the slave states\r\nbear much more severely on slaves than on white persons. He introduces\r\nhis consideration of this proposition by the following humane and\r\nsensible remarks:\r\n\r\n  A being, ignorant of letters, unenlightened by religion, and\r\n  deriving but little instruction from good example, cannot be\r\n  supposed to have right conceptions as to the nature and extent of\r\n  moral or political obligations. This remark, with but a slight\r\n  qualification, is applicable to the condition of the slave. It has\r\n  been just shown that the benefits of education are not conferred\r\n  upon him, while his _chance_ of acquiring a knowledge of the\r\n  precepts of the gospel is so remote as scarcely to be appreciated.\r\n  He may be regarded, therefore as almost without the capacity to\r\n  comprehend the force of laws; and, on this account, such as are\r\n  designed for his government should be recommended by their\r\n  simplicity and mildness.\r\n\r\n  His condition suggests another motive for tenderness on his behalf\r\n  in these particulars. _He is unable to read_, and holding little or\r\n  no communication with those who are better informed than himself;\r\n  how is he to become acquainted with the fact that a law for his\r\n  observance has been made? To exact obedience to a law which has not\r\n  been promulgated,—which is unknown to the subject of it,—has ever\r\n  been deemed most unjust and tyrannical. The reign of Caligula, were\r\n  it obnoxious to no other reproach than this, would never cease to be\r\n  remembered with abhorrence.\r\n\r\n  The lawgivers of the slaveholding states seem, in the formation of\r\n  their penal codes, to have been uninfluenced by these claims of the\r\n  slave upon their compassionate consideration. The _hardened convict_\r\n  moves their sympathy, and is to be _taught_ the laws _before_ he is\r\n  expected to obey them; yet the _guiltless slave_ is subjected to an\r\n  extensive system of cruel enactments, of no part of which, probably,\r\n  has he ever heard.\r\n\r\n  Parts of this system apply to the slave exclusively, and for every\r\n  infraction a large retribution is demanded; while, with respect to\r\n  offences for which whites as well as slaves are amenable,\r\n  _punishments of much greater severity are inflicted upon the latter_\r\n  than upon the former.\r\n\r\nThis heavy charge of Judge Stroud is sustained by twenty pages of proof,\r\nshowing the very great disproportion between the number of offences made\r\ncapital for slaves, and those that are so for whites. Concerning this,\r\nwe find the following cool remark in Wheeler’s Law of Slavery, page 222,\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n  Much has been said of the disparity of punishment between the white\r\n  inhabitants and the slaves and negroes of the same state; that\r\n  slaves are punished with much more severity, for the commission of\r\n  similar crimes, by white persons, than the latter. The charge is\r\n  undoubtedly true to a considerable extent. It must be remembered\r\n  that the primary object of the enactment of penal laws, is the\r\n  protection and security of those who make them. The slave has no\r\n  agency in making them. He is indeed one cause of the apprehended\r\n  evils to the other class, which those laws are expected to remedy.\r\n  That he should be held amenable for a violation of those rules\r\n  established for the security of the other, is the natural result of\r\n  the state in which he is placed. And the severity of those rules\r\n  will always bear a relation to that danger, real or ideal, of the\r\n  other class.\r\n\r\n  It has been so among all nations, and will ever continue to be so,\r\n  while the disparity between bond and free remains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The State _v._ Mann. Dec. Term, 1829. 2 Devereaux’s North\r\n           Carolina Rep. 265.]\r\n\r\nA striking example of a legal decision to this purport is given in\r\nWheeler’s Law of Slavery, page 224. The case, apart from legal\r\ntechnicalities, may be thus briefly stated:\r\n\r\nThe defendant, Mann, had hired a slave-woman for a year. During this\r\ntime the slave committed some slight offence, for which the defendant\r\nundertook to chastise her. While in the act of doing so the slave ran\r\noff, whereat he shot at and wounded her. The judge in the inferior court\r\ncharged the jury that if they believed the punishment was cruel and\r\nunwarrantable, and disproportioned to the offence, in law the defendant\r\nwas guilty, _as he had only a special property in the slave_. The jury\r\nfinding evidence that the punishment _had_ been cruel, unwarrantable and\r\n_disproportioned to the offence_, found verdict against the defendant.\r\nBut on what ground?—Because, according to the law of North Carolina,\r\ncruel, unwarrantable, disproportionate punishment of a slave from a\r\nmaster, is an indictable offence? No. They decided against the\r\ndefendant, not because the punishment was cruel and unwarrantable, but\r\nbecause _he_ was not the person who had the right to inflict it, “as he\r\nhad only a SPECIAL _right of property in the slave_.”\r\n\r\nThe defendant appealed to a higher court, and the decision was reversed,\r\non the ground that the hirer has for the time being all the rights of\r\nthe master. The remarks of Judge Ruffin are so characteristic, and so\r\nstrongly express the conflict between the feelings of the humane judge\r\nand the logical necessity of a strict interpreter of slave-law, that we\r\nshall quote largely from it. One cannot but admire the unflinching\r\ncalmness with which a man, evidently possessed of honorable and humane\r\nfeelings, walks through the most extreme and terrible results and\r\nconclusions, in obedience to the laws of legal truth. Thus he says:\r\n\r\n  A judge cannot but lament, when such cases as the present are\r\n  brought into judgment. It is impossible that the reasons on which\r\n  they go can be appreciated, but where institutions similar to our\r\n  own exist, and are _thoroughly understood_. The struggle, too, in\r\n  the judge’s own breast, between the feelings of the man and the duty\r\n  of the magistrate, is a severe one, presenting strong temptation to\r\n  put aside such questions, if it be possible. It is useless, however,\r\n  to complain of things inherent in our political state. And it is\r\n  criminal in a court to avoid any responsibility which the laws\r\n  impose. With whatever reluctance, therefore, it is done, the court\r\n  is compelled to express an opinion upon the extent of the dominion\r\n  of the master over the slave in North Carolina. The indictment\r\n  charges a battery on Lydia, a slave of Elizabeth Jones.... The\r\n  inquiry here is, whether a cruel and unreasonable battery on a slave\r\n  by the hirer is indictable. The judge below instructed the jury that\r\n  it is. He seems to have put it on the ground, that the defendant had\r\n  but a special property. Our laws uniformly treat the master, or\r\n  other person having the possession and command of the slave, as\r\n  entitled to the same extent of authority. _The object is the same,\r\n  the service of the slave_; and the same powers must be confided. In\r\n  a criminal proceeding, and, indeed, in reference to all other\r\n  persons but the general owner, the hirer and possessor of the slave,\r\n  in relation to both rights and duties, is, for the time being, the\r\n  owner.... But, upon the general question, whether the owner is\r\n  answerable _criminaliter_, for a battery upon his own slave, or\r\n  other exercise of authority of force, not forbidden by statute, the\r\n  court entertains but little doubt. That he is so liable, has never\r\n  been decided; nor, as far as is known, been hitherto contended.\r\n  There has been no prosecution of the sort. The established habits\r\n  and uniform practice of the country, in this respect, is the best\r\n  evidence of the portion of power deemed by the whole community\r\n  requisite to the preservation of the master’s dominion. If we\r\n  thought differently, we could not set our notions in array against\r\n  the judgment of everybody else, and say that this or that authority\r\n  may be safely lopped off. This has indeed been assimilated at the\r\n  bar to the other domestic relations; and arguments drawn from the\r\n  well-established principles, which _confer_ and _restrain_ the\r\n  authority of the parent over the child, the tutor over the pupil,\r\n  the master over the apprentice, have been pressed on us.\r\n\r\n  The court does not recognize their application. There is no likeness\r\n  between the cases. They are in opposition to each other, and there\r\n  is an impassable gulf between them. The difference is that which\r\n  exists between freedom and slavery; and a greater cannot be\r\n  imagined. In the one, the end in view is the happiness of the youth\r\n  born to equal rights with that governor on whom the duty devolves of\r\n  training the young to usefulness, in a station which he is\r\n  afterwards to assume among freemen. To such an end, and with such a\r\n  subject, moral and intellectual instruction seem the natural means;\r\n  and, for the most part, they are found to suffice. Moderate force is\r\n  superadded only to make the others effectual. If that fail, it is\r\n  better to leave the party to his own headstrong passions, and the\r\n  ultimate correction of the law, than to allow it to be immoderately\r\n  inflicted by a private person. With slavery it is far otherwise. The\r\n  end is the profit of the master, his security and the public safety;\r\n  the subject, one doomed, in his own person and his posterity, to\r\n  live without knowledge, and without the capacity to make anything\r\n  his own, and to toil that another may reap the fruits. What moral\r\n  considerations shall be addressed to such a being, to convince him\r\n  what it is impossible but that the most stupid must feel and know\r\n  can never be true,—that he is thus to labor upon a principle of\r\n  natural duty, or for the sake of his own personal happiness? Such\r\n  services can only be expected from one who has no will of his own;\r\n  who surrenders his will in implicit obedience to that of another.\r\n  Such obedience is the consequence only of uncontrolled authority\r\n  over the body. There is nothing else which can operate to produce\r\n  the effect. THE POWER OF THE MASTER MUST BE ABSOLUTE, TO RENDER THE\r\n  SUBMISSION OF THE SLAVE PERFECT. I most freely confess my sense of\r\n  the harshness of this proposition. I feel it as deeply as any man\r\n  can. And, as a principle of moral right, every person in his\r\n  retirement must repudiate it. But, in the actual condition of\r\n  things, it must be so. There is no remedy. This discipline belongs\r\n  to the state of slavery. They cannot be disunited without abrogating\r\n  at once the rights of the master, and absolving the slave from his\r\n  subjection. It constitutes the curse of slavery to both the bond and\r\n  the free portions of our population. But it is _inherent in the\r\n  relation_ of master and slave. That there may be particular\r\n  instances of cruelty and deliberate barbarity, where in conscience\r\n  the law might properly interfere, is most probable. The difficulty\r\n  is to determine where _a court_ may properly begin. Merely in the\r\n  abstract, it may well be asked which power of the master accords\r\n  with right. The answer will probably sweep away all of them. But we\r\n  cannot look at the matter in that light. The truth is that we are\r\n  forbidden to enter upon a train of general reasoning on the subject.\r\n  We cannot allow the right of the master to be brought into\r\n  discussion in the courts of justice. The slave, to remain a slave,\r\n  must be made sensible that there is no appeal from his master; that\r\n  his power is, in no instance, usurped, but is conferred by the laws\r\n  of man, at least, if not by the law of God. The danger would be\r\n  great, indeed, if the tribunals of justice should be called on to\r\n  graduate the punishment appropriate to every temper and every\r\n  dereliction of menial duty.\r\n\r\n  No man can anticipate the many and aggravated provocations of the\r\n  master which the slave would be constantly stimulated by his own\r\n  passions, or the instigation of others, to give; or the consequent\r\n  wrath of the master, prompting him to bloody vengeance upon the\r\n  turbulent traitor; a vengeance _generally practised with impunity,\r\n  by reason of its privacy_. The court, therefore, disclaims the power\r\n  of changing the relation in which these parts of our people stand to\r\n  each other.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  I repeat, that I would gladly have avoided this ungrateful question.\r\n  But, being brought to it, the court is compelled to declare that\r\n  while slavery exists amongst us in its present state, or until it\r\n  shall seem fit to the legislature to interpose express enactments to\r\n  the contrary, it will be the imperative _duty_ of the judges _to\r\n  recognize the full dominion of the owner over the slave_, except\r\n  where the exercise of it is forbidden by statute.\r\n\r\n  And this we do upon the ground that _this dominion is essential to\r\n  the value of slaves as property, to the security of the master and\r\n  the public tranquility, greatly dependent upon their subordination_;\r\n  and, in fine, as most effectually securing the general protection\r\n  and comfort of the slaves themselves. Judgment below reversed; and\r\n  judgment entered for the defendant.\r\n\r\nNo one can read this decision, so fine and clear in expression, so\r\ndignified and solemn in its earnestness, and so dreadful in its results,\r\nwithout feeling at once deep respect for the man and horror for the\r\nsystem. The man, judging him from this short specimen, which is all the\r\nauthor knows,[5] has one of that high order of minds, which looks\r\nstraight through all verbiage and sophistry to the heart of every\r\nsubject which it encounters. He has, too, that noble scorn of\r\ndissimulation, that straight-forward determination not to call a bad\r\nthing by a good name, even when most popular and reputable and legal,\r\nwhich it is to be wished could be more frequently seen, both in our\r\nNorthern and Southern States. There is but one sole regret; and that is\r\nthat such a man, with such a mind, should have been merely an\r\n_expositor_, and not a _reformer_ of law.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  We except the State of Louisiana. Owing to the influence of the French\r\n  code in that state, more really humane provisions prevail there. How\r\n  much these provisions avail in point of fact, will be shown when we\r\n  come to that part of the subject.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  More recently the author has met with a passage in a North Carolina\r\n  newspaper, containing some further particulars of the life of Judge\r\n  Ruffin, which have proved interesting to her, and may also to the\r\n  reader.\r\n\r\n                 _From the Raleigh_ (_N. C._) _Register._\r\n\r\n     RESIGNATION OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n  We publish below the letter of Chief Justice Ruffin, of the Supreme\r\n  Court, resigning his seat on the bench.\r\n\r\n  This act takes us, and no less will it take the state, by surprise.\r\n  The public are not prepared for it; and we doubt not there will\r\n  scarcely be an exception to the deep and general regret which will be\r\n  felt throughout the state. Judge Ruffin’s great and unsurpassed legal\r\n  learning, his untiring industry, the ease with which he mastered the\r\n  details and comprehended the whole of the most complicated cases, were\r\n  the admiration of the bar; and it has been a common saying of the\r\n  ablest lawyers of the state, for a long time past, that his place on\r\n  the bench could be supplied by no other than himself.\r\n\r\n  He is now, as we learn, in the sixty-fifth year of his age, in full\r\n  possession of his usual excellent health, unaffected, so far as we can\r\n  discover, in his natural vigor and strength, and certainly without any\r\n  symptom of mental decay. Forty-five years ago he commenced the\r\n  practice of the law. He has been on the bench twenty-eight years, of\r\n  which time he has been one of the Supreme Court twenty-three years.\r\n  During this long public career he has, in a pecuniary point of view,\r\n  sacrificed many thousands; for there has been no time of it in which\r\n  he might not, with perfect ease, have doubled, by practice, the amount\r\n  of his salary as judge.\r\n\r\n    “_To the Honorable the General Assembly of North Carolina, now in\r\n                                session._\r\n\r\n  “Gentlemen: I desire to retire to the walks of private life, and\r\n  therefore pray your honorable body to accept the resignation of my\r\n  place on the bench of the Supreme Court. In surrendering this trust, I\r\n  would wish to express my grateful sense of the confidence and honors\r\n  so often and so long bestowed on me by the General Assembly. But I\r\n  have no language to do it suitably. I am very sensible that they were\r\n  far beyond my deserts, and that I have made an insufficient return of\r\n  the service. Yet I can truly aver that, to the best of my ability, I\r\n  have administered the law as I understood it, and to the ends of\r\n  suppressing crime and wrong, and upholding virtue, truth and right;\r\n  aiming to give confidence to honest men, and to confirm in all good\r\n  citizens love for our country, and a pure trust in her law and\r\n  magistrates.\r\n\r\n  “In my place I hope I have contributed to these ends; and I firmly\r\n  believe that our laws will, as heretofore, be executed, and our people\r\n  happy in the administration of justice, honest and contented, as long\r\n  as they keep, and only so long as they keep, the independent and sound\r\n  judiciary now established in the constitution; which, with all other\r\n  blessings, I earnestly pray may be perpetuated to the people of North\r\n  Carolina.\r\n\r\n  “I have the honor to be, gentlemen, your most obliged and obedient\r\n  servant,\r\n\r\n                                                          THOMAS RUFFIN.\r\n\r\n  “_Raleigh, November 10, 1852._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n   SOUTHER _v._ THE COMMONWEALTH—THE NE PLUS ULTRA OF LEGAL HUMANITY.\r\n\r\n“Yet in the face of _such_ laws and decisions as _these_! Mrs. Stowe,\r\n&c.”—_Courier & Enquirer_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe case of Souther _v._ the Commonwealth has been cited by the _Courier\r\n& Enquirer_ as a particularly favorable specimen of judicial proceedings\r\nunder the slave-code, with the following remark:\r\n\r\n  And yet, in the face of such laws and decisions as these, Mrs. Stowe\r\n  winds up a long series of cruelties upon her other black personages,\r\n  by causing her faultless hero, Tom, to be literally whipped to death\r\n  in Louisiana, by his master, Legree; and these acts, which the laws\r\n  make criminal, and punish as such, she sets forth in the most\r\n  repulsive colors, to illustrate the institution of slavery!\r\n\r\nBy the above language the author was led into the supposition that this\r\ncase had been conducted in a manner so creditable to the feelings of our\r\ncommon humanity as to present a fairer side of criminal jurisprudence in\r\nthis respect. She accordingly took the pains to procure a report of the\r\ncase, designing to publish it as an offset to the many barbarities which\r\nresearch into this branch of the subject obliges one to unfold. A legal\r\ngentleman has copied the case from Grattan’s Reports, and it is here\r\ngiven. If the reader is astounded at it, he cannot be more so than was\r\nthe writer.\r\n\r\n          _Souther v. The Commonwealth. 7 Grattan, 673, 1851._\r\n\r\n    The killing of a slave by his master and owner, by wilful and\r\n      excessive whipping, is murder in the first degree: though it\r\n      may not have been the purpose and intention of the master and\r\n      owner to kill the slave.\r\n\r\n  Simeon Souther was indicted at the October Term, 1850, of the\r\n  Circuit Court for the County of Hanover, for the murder of his own\r\n  slave. The indictment contained fifteen counts, in which the various\r\n  modes of punishment and torture by which the homicide was charged to\r\n  have been committed were stated singly, and in various combinations.\r\n  The fifteenth count unites them all: and, as the court certifies\r\n  that the _indictment was sustained by the evidence_, the giving the\r\n  facts stated in that count will show what was the charge against the\r\n  prisoner, and what was the proof to sustain it.\r\n\r\n  The count charged that on the 1st day of September, 1849, the\r\n  prisoner tied his negro slave, Sam, with ropes about his wrists,\r\n  neck, body, legs and ankles, to a tree. That whilst so tied, the\r\n  prisoner first whipped the slave with switches. That he next beat\r\n  and cobbed the slave with a shingle, and compelled two of his\r\n  slaves, a man and a woman, also to cob the deceased with the\r\n  shingle. That whilst the deceased was so tied to the tree, the\r\n  prisoner did strike, knock, kick, stamp and beat him upon various\r\n  parts of his head, face and body; that he applied fire to his body;\r\n  * * * * that he then washed his body with warm water, in which pods\r\n  of red pepper had been put and steeped; and he compelled his two\r\n  slaves aforesaid also to wash him with this same preparation of warm\r\n  water and red pepper. That after the tying, whipping, cobbing,\r\n  striking, beating, knocking, kicking, stamping, wounding, bruising,\r\n  lacerating, burning, washing and torturing, as aforesaid, the\r\n  prisoner untied the deceased from the tree in such way as to throw\r\n  him with violence to the ground; and he then and there did knock,\r\n  kick, stamp and beat the deceased upon his head, temples, and\r\n  various parts of his body. That the prisoner then had the deceased\r\n  carried into a shed-room of his house, and there he compelled one of\r\n  his slaves, in his presence, to confine the deceased’s feet in\r\n  stocks, by making his legs fast to a piece of timber, and to tie a\r\n  rope about the neck of the deceased, and fasten it to a bed-post in\r\n  the room, thereby strangling, choking and suffocating the deceased.\r\n  And that whilst the deceased was thus made fast in stocks as\r\n  aforesaid, the prisoner did kick, knock, stamp and beat him upon his\r\n  head, face, breast, belly, sides, back and body; and he again\r\n  compelled his two slaves to apply fire to the body of the deceased,\r\n  whilst he was so made fast as aforesaid. And the count charged that\r\n  from these various modes of punishment and torture the slave Sam\r\n  then and there died. It appeared that the prisoner commenced the\r\n  punishment of the deceased in the morning, and that it was continued\r\n  throughout the day: and that the deceased died in the presence of\r\n  the prisoner, and one of his slaves, and one of the witnesses,\r\n  whilst the punishment was still progressing.\r\n\r\n  Field J. delivered the opinion of the court.\r\n\r\n  The prisoner was indicted and convicted of _murder in the second\r\n  degree_, in the Circuit Court of Hanover, at its April term last\r\n  past, and was sentenced to the _penitentiary for five years_, the\r\n  period of time ascertained by the jury. The murder consisted in the\r\n  killing of a negro man-slave by the name of Sam, the property of the\r\n  prisoner, by cruel and excessive whipping and torture, inflicted by\r\n  Souther, aided by two of his other slaves, on the 1st day of\r\n  September, 1849. The prisoner moved for a new trial, upon the ground\r\n  that the offence, _if any_, amounted only to manslaughter. The\r\n  motion for a new trial was overruled, and a bill of exceptions taken\r\n  to the opinion of the court, setting forth the facts proved, or as\r\n  many of them as were deemed material for the consideration of the\r\n  application for a new trial. The bill of exception states: That the\r\n  slave Sam, in the indictment mentioned, was the slave and property\r\n  of the prisoner. That for the purpose of chastising the slave for\r\n  the offence of getting drunk, and dealing as the slave confessed and\r\n  alleged with Henry and Stone, two of the witnesses for the\r\n  Commonwealth, he caused him to be tied and punished in the presence\r\n  of the said witnesses, with the exception of slight whipping with\r\n  peach or apple-tree switches, before the said witnesses arrived at\r\n  the scene after they were sent for by the prisoner (who were present\r\n  by request from the defendant), and of several slaves of the\r\n  prisoner, in the manner and by the means charged in the indictment;\r\n  and the said slave died under and from the infliction of the said\r\n  punishment, in the presence of the prisoner, one of his slaves, and\r\n  of one of the witnesses for the Commonwealth. But it did not appear\r\n  that it was the design of the prisoner to kill the said slave,\r\n  unless such design be properly inferable from the manner, means and\r\n  duration of the punishment. And, on the contrary, it did appear that\r\n  the prisoner frequently declared, while the said slave was\r\n  undergoing the punishment, that he believed the said slave was\r\n  feigning, and pretending to be suffering and injured when he was\r\n  not. The judge certifies that the slave was punished in the _manner\r\n  and by the means charged in the indictment_. The indictment contains\r\n  fifteen counts, and sets forth a case of the most cruel and\r\n  excessive whipping and torture.[6]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  It is believed that the records of criminal jurisprudence do not\r\n  contain a case of more atrocious and wicked cruelty than was\r\n  presented upon the trial of Souther; and yet it has been gravely and\r\n  earnestly contended here by his counsel that his offence amounts to\r\n  manslaughter only.\r\n\r\n  It has been contended by the counsel of the prisoner that a man\r\n  cannot be indicted and prosecuted for the cruel and excessive\r\n  whipping of his own slave. That it is lawful for the master to\r\n  chastise his slave, and that if death ensues from such chastisement,\r\n  unless it was intended to produce death, it is like the case of\r\n  homicide which is committed by a man in the performance of a lawful\r\n  act, which is manslaughter only. It has been decided by this court\r\n  in Turner’s case, 5 Rand, that the owner of a slave, for the\r\n  malicious, cruel and excessive beating of his own slave, cannot be\r\n  indicted; yet it by no means follows, when such malicious, cruel and\r\n  excessive beating results in death, though not intended and\r\n  premeditated, that the beating is to be regarded as lawful for the\r\n  purpose of reducing the crime to manslaughter, when the whipping is\r\n  inflicted for the sole purpose of chastisement. _It is the policy of\r\n  the law, in respect to the relation of master and slave, and for the\r\n  sake of securing proper subordination and obedience on the part of\r\n  the slave, to protect the master from prosecution in all such cases,\r\n  even if the whipping and punishment be malicious, cruel and\r\n  excessive._ But in so inflicting punishment for the sake of\r\n  punishment, the owner of the slave acts at his peril; and if death\r\n  ensues in consequence of such punishment, the relation of master and\r\n  slave affords no ground of excuse or palliation. The principles of\r\n  the common law, in relation to homicide, apply to his case without\r\n  qualification or exception; and according to those principles, the\r\n  act of the prisoner, in the case under consideration, amounted to\r\n  murder. * * * The crime of the prisoner is not manslaughter, but\r\n  murder in the first degree.\r\n\r\nOn the case now presented there are some remarks to be made.\r\n\r\nThis scene of torture, it seems, occupied about twelve hours. It\r\noccurred in the State of Virginia, in the County of Hanover. Two white\r\nmen were witnesses to nearly the whole proceeding, and, so far as we can\r\nsee, made no effort to arouse the neighborhood, and bring in help to\r\nstop the outrage. What sort of an education, what habits of thought,\r\ndoes this presuppose in these men?\r\n\r\nThe case was brought to trial. It requires no ordinary nerve to read\r\nover the counts of this indictment. Nobody, one would suppose, could\r\nwillingly read them twice. One would think that it would have laid a\r\ncold hand of horror on every heart;—that the community would have risen,\r\nby an universal sentiment, to shake out the man, as Paul shook the viper\r\nfrom his hand. It seems, however, that they were quite self-possessed;\r\nthat lawyers calmly sat, and examined, and cross-examined, on\r\nparticulars known before only in the records of the Inquisition; that it\r\nwas “ably and earnestly argued” by educated, intelligent, American men,\r\nthat this catalogue of horrors did not amount to a murder! and, in the\r\ncool language of legal precision, that “the offence, IF ANY, amounted to\r\nmanslaughter;” and that an American jury found that the offence was\r\nmurder _in the second degree_. Any one who reads the indictment will\r\ncertainly think that, if this be murder in the _second degree_, in\r\nVirginia, one might earnestly pray to be murdered in the first degree,\r\nto begin with. Had Souther walked up to the man, and shot him through\r\nthe head with a pistol, before white witnesses, _that_ would have been\r\nmurder in the _first_ degree. As he preferred to spend _twelve hours_ in\r\nkilling him by torture, under the name of “_chastisement_,” that, says\r\nthe verdict, is murder in the second degree; “_because_,” says the bill\r\nof exceptions, with admirable coolness, “_it did not appear that it was\r\nthe design of the prisoner to kill the slave_, UNLESS SUCH DESIGN BE\r\nPROPERLY INFERABLE FROM THE MANNER, MEANS AND DURATION, OF THE\r\nPUNISHMENT.”\r\n\r\nThe bill evidently seems to have a leaning to the idea that twelve hours\r\nspent in beating, stamping, scalding, burning and mutilating a human\r\nbeing, might possibly be considered as presumption of something beyond\r\nthe limits of lawful chastisement. So startling an opinion, however, is\r\nexpressed cautiously, and with a becoming diffidence, and is balanced by\r\nthe very striking fact, which is also quoted in this remarkable paper,\r\nthat the prisoner frequently declared, while the slave was undergoing\r\nthe punishment, that he believed the slave was feigning and pretending\r\nto be suffering, when he was not. This view appears to have struck the\r\ncourt as eminently probable,—as going a long way to prove the propriety\r\nof Souther’s intentions, making it at least extremely probable that only\r\n_correction_ was intended.\r\n\r\nIt seems, also, that Souther, so far from being crushed by the united\r\nopinion of the community, found those to back him who considered five\r\nyears in the penitentiary an unjust severity for his crime, and hence\r\nthe bill of exceptions from which we have quoted, and the appeal to the\r\nSuperior Court; and hence the form in which the case stands in\r\nlaw-books, “_Souther v. the Commonwealth_.” Souther evidently considers\r\nhimself an ill-used man, and it is in this character that he appears\r\nbefore the Superior Court.\r\n\r\nAs yet there has been no particular overflow of humanity in the\r\ntreatment of the case. The manner in which it has been discussed so far\r\nreminds one of nothing so much as of some discussions which the reader\r\nmay have seen quoted from the records of the Inquisition, with regard to\r\nthe propriety of roasting the feet of children who have not arrived at\r\nthe age of thirteen years, with a view to eliciting evidence.\r\n\r\nLet us now come to the decision of the Superior Court, which the editor\r\nof the _Courier & Enquirer_ thinks so particularly enlightened and\r\nhumane. Judge Field thinks that the case is a very atrocious one, and in\r\nthis respect he seems to differ materially from judge, jury and lawyers,\r\nof the court below. Furthermore, he doubts whether the annals of\r\njurisprudence furnish a case of equal atrocity, wherein certainly he\r\nappears to be not far wrong; and he also states unequivocally the\r\nprinciple that killing a slave by torture under the name of correction\r\nis murder in the first degree; and here too, certainly, everybody will\r\nthink that he is also right: the only wonder being that any man could\r\never have been called to express such an opinion, judicially. But he\r\nstates, quite as unequivocally as Judge Ruffin, that awful principle of\r\nslave-laws, that the law cannot interfere with the master for any amount\r\nof torture inflicted on his slave which does not result in death. The\r\ndecision, if it establishes anything, establishes this principle quite\r\nas strongly as it does the other. Let us hear the words of the decision:\r\n\r\n  It has been decided by this court, in Turner’s case, that _the owner\r\n  of a slave, for the malicious, cruel and excessive beating of his\r\n  own slave, cannot be indicted. * * * * * * It is the policy of the\r\n  law, in respect to the relation of master and slave, and for the\r\n  sake of securing proper subordination and obedience on the part of\r\n  the slave, to protect the master from prosecution in all such cases,\r\n  even if the whipping and punishment be malicious, cruel and\r\n  excessive._\r\n\r\nWhat follows as a corollary from this remarkable declaration is\r\nthis,—that if the victim of this twelve hours’ torture had only\r\npossessed a little stronger constitution, and had not actually died\r\nunder it, there is no law in Virginia by which Souther could even have\r\nbeen indicted for misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nIf this is not filling out the measure of the language of St. Clare,\r\nthat “he who goes the furthest and does the worst only uses within\r\nlimits the power which the law gives him,” how could this language be\r\nverified? Which is “_the worst_,” death outright, or torture\r\nindefinitely prolonged? This decision, in so many words, gives every\r\nmaster the power of indefinite torture, and takes from him only the\r\npower of terminating the agony by merciful death. And this is the\r\njudicial decision which the _Courier & Enquirer_ cites as a perfectly\r\nconvincing specimen of legal humanity. It must be hoped that the editor\r\nnever read the decision, else he never would have cited it. Of all who\r\nknock at the charnel-house of legal precedents, with the hope of\r\ndisinterring any evidence of humanity in the slave system, it may be\r\nsaid, in the awful words of the Hebrew poet:\r\n\r\n            “He knoweth not that the dead are there,\r\n            And that her guests are in the depths of hell.”\r\n\r\nThe upshot of this case was, that Souther, instead of getting off from\r\nhis five years’ imprisonment, got simply a judicial _opinion_ from the\r\nSuperior Court that he ought to be hung; but he could not be tried over\r\nagain, and, as we may infer from all the facts in the case that he was a\r\nman of tolerably resolute nerves and not very exquisite sensibility, it\r\nis not likely that the _opinion_ gave him any very serious uneasiness.\r\nHe has probably made up his mind to get over his five years with what\r\ngrace he may. When he comes out, there is no law in Virginia to prevent\r\nhis buying as many more negroes as he chooses, and going over the same\r\nscene with any one of them at a future time, if only he profit by the\r\ninformation which has been so explicitly conveyed to him in this\r\ndecision, that he must take care and stop his tortures short of the\r\npoint of death,—a matter about which, as the history of the Inquisition\r\nshows, men, by careful practice, can be able to judge with considerable\r\nprecision. Probably, also, the next time, he will not be so foolish as\r\nto send out and request the attendance of two white witnesses, even\r\nthough they may be so complacently interested in the proceedings as to\r\nspend the whole day in witnessing them without effort at prevention.\r\n\r\nSlavery, as defined in American law, is no more capable of being\r\nregulated in its administration by principles of humanity, than the\r\ntorture system of the Inquisition. Every act of humanity of every\r\nindividual owner is an illogical result from the legal definition; and\r\nthe reason why the slave-code of America is more atrocious than any ever\r\nbefore exhibited under the sun, is that the Anglo-Saxon race are a more\r\ncoldly and strictly logical race, and have an unflinching courage to\r\nmeet the consequences of every premise which they lay down, and to work\r\nout an accursed principle, with mathematical accuracy, to its most\r\naccursed results. The decisions in American law-books show nothing so\r\nmuch as this severe, unflinching accuracy of logic. It is often and\r\nevidently, not because judges are inhuman or partial, but because they\r\nare logical and truthful, that they announce from the bench, in the\r\ncalmest manner, decisions which one would think might make the earth\r\nshudder, and the sun turn pale.\r\n\r\nThe French and the Spanish nations are, by constitution, more impulsive,\r\npassionate and poetic, than logical; hence it will be found that while\r\nthere may be more instances of individual barbarity, as might be\r\nexpected among impulsive and passionate people, there is in their\r\nslave-code more exhibition of humanity. The code of the State of\r\nLouisiana contains more really humane provisions, were there any means\r\nof enforcing them, than that of any other state in the Union.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that there is no code of laws in the world which contains\r\nsuch a perfect cabinet crystallization of every tear and every drop of\r\nblood which can be wrung from humanity, so accurately, elegantly and\r\nscientifically arranged, as the slave-code of America. It is a case of\r\nelegant surgical instruments for the work of dissecting the living human\r\nheart;—every instrument wrought with exactest temper and polish, and\r\nadapted with exquisite care, and labelled with the name of the nerve or\r\nartery or muscle which it is designed to sever. The instruments of the\r\nanatomist are instruments of earthly steel and wood, designed to operate\r\nat most on perishable and corruptible matter; but these are instruments\r\nof keener temper, and more ethereal workmanship, designed in the most\r\nprecise and scientific manner to DESTROY THE IMMORTAL SOUL, and\r\ncarefully and gradually to reduce man from the high position of a free\r\nagent, a social, religious, accountable being, down to the condition of\r\nthe brute, or of inanimate matter.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  The following is Judge Field’s statement of the punishment:\r\n\r\n  The negro was tied to a tree and whipped with switches. When Souther\r\n  became fatigued with the labor of whipping, he called upon a negro man\r\n  of his, and made him cob Sam with a shingle. He also made a negro\r\n  woman of his help to cob him. And, after cobbing and whipping, he\r\n  applied fire to the body of the slave. * * * * He then caused him to\r\n  be washed down with hot water, in which pods of red pepper had been\r\n  steeped. The negro was also tied to a log and to the bed-post with\r\n  ropes, which choked him, and he was kicked and stamped by Souther.\r\n  This sort of punishment was continued and repeated until the negro\r\n  died under its infliction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n                          PROTECTIVE STATUTES.\r\n\r\n  Apprentices protected.—Outlawry.—Melodrama of Prue in the\r\n    Swamp.—Harry the Carpenter, a Romance of Real Life.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the question now occurs, Are there not protective statutes, the\r\navowed object of which is the protection of the life and limb of the\r\nslave? We answer, there are; and these protective statutes are some of\r\nthe most remarkable pieces of legislation extant.\r\n\r\nThat they were dictated by a spirit of humanity, charity, which hopeth\r\n_all_ things, would lead us to hope; but no newspaper stories of bloody\r\nmurders and shocking outrages convey to the mind so dreadful a picture\r\nof the numbness of public sentiment caused by slavery as these so-called\r\nprotective statutes. The author copies the following from the statutes\r\nof North Carolina. Section 3d of the act passed in 1798 runs thus:\r\n\r\n  Whereas by another Act of the Assembly, passed in 1774, the killing\r\n  of a slave, however wanton, cruel and deliberate, is only punishable\r\n  in the first instance by imprisonment and paying the value thereof\r\n  to the owner, which _distinction of criminality between the murder\r\n  of a white person and one who is equally a human creature, but\r\n  merely of a different complexion, is_ DISGRACEFUL TO HUMANITY, AND\r\n  DEGRADING IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE TO THE LAWS AND PRINCIPLES OF A\r\n  FREE, CHRISTIAN AND ENLIGHTENED COUNTRY, Be it enacted, &c., That if\r\n  any person shall hereafter be guilty of wilfully and maliciously\r\n  killing a slave, such offender shall, upon the first conviction\r\n  thereof, be adjudged guilty of murder, and shall suffer the same\r\n  punishment as if he had killed a free man: “_Provided always, this\r\n  act shall not extend to the person killing a slave_ OUTLAWED BY\r\n  VIRTUE OF ANY ACT OF ASSEMBLY OF THIS STATE, _or to any slave in the\r\n  act of resistance to his lawful owner or master, or to any slave\r\n  dying under moderate correction_.”\r\n\r\nA law with a like proviso, except the outlawry clause, exists in\r\nTennessee. _See Caruthers and Nicholson’s Compilation_, 1836, p. 676.\r\n\r\nThe language of the constitution of Georgia, art. iv., sec. 12, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Any person who shall maliciously dismember or deprive a slave of\r\n  life shall suffer such punishment as would be inflicted in case the\r\n  like offence had been committed on a free white person, and on the\r\n  like proof, except in case of insurrection by such slave, and\r\n  _unless such death should_ happen _by accident in giving such slave\r\n  moderate correction_.—_Cobb’s Dig._ 1851, p. 1125.\r\n\r\nLet now any Englishman or New Englander imagine that such laws with\r\nregard to apprentices had ever been proposed in Parliament or State\r\nLegislature under the head of _protective acts_;—laws which in so many\r\nwords permit the killing of the subject in three cases, and those\r\ncomprising all the acts which would generally occur under the law;\r\nnamely, if the slave resist, if he be outlawed, or if he die under\r\n_moderate_ correction.\r\n\r\nWhat rule in the world will ever prove correction immoderate, if the\r\nfact that the subject _dies_ under it is not held as proof? How many\r\nsuch “accidents” would have to happen in Old England or New England,\r\nbefore Parliament or Legislature would hear from such a protective law.\r\n\r\n“But,” some one may ask, “what is the _outlawry_ spoken of in this act?”\r\nThe question is pertinent, and must be answered. The author has copied\r\nthe following from the Revised Statutes of North Carolina, chap. cxi,\r\nsec. 22. It may be remarked in passing that the preamble to this law\r\npresents rather a new view of slavery to those who have formed their\r\nideas from certain pictures of blissful contentment and Arcadian repose,\r\nwhich have been much in vogue of late.\r\n\r\n  Whereas, MANY TIMES _slaves run away and be out, hid and lurking in\r\n  swamps, woods, and other obscure places_, killing cattle and hogs,\r\n  and committing other injuries to the inhabitants of this state; in\r\n  all such cases, upon intelligence of any slave or slaves lying out\r\n  as aforesaid, any two justices of the peace for the county wherein\r\n  such slave or slaves is or are supposed to lurk or do mischief,\r\n  shall, and they are hereby empowered and required to issue\r\n  proclamation against such slave or slaves (reciting his or their\r\n  names, and the name or names of the owner or owners, if known),\r\n  thereby requiring him or them, and every of them, forthwith to\r\n  surrender him or themselves; and also to empower and require the\r\n  sheriff of the said county to take such power with him as he shall\r\n  think fit and necessary for going in search and pursuit of, and\r\n  effectually apprehending, such outlying slave or slaves; which\r\n  proclamation shall be published at the door of the court-house, and\r\n  at such other places as said justices shall direct. And if any slave\r\n  or slaves against whom proclamation hath been thus issued stay out,\r\n  and do not immediately return home, it shall be lawful for any\r\n  person or persons whatsoever to kill and destroy such slave or\r\n  slaves by _such ways and means as he shall think fit_, without\r\n  accusation or impeachment of any crime for the same.\r\n\r\nWhat ways and means _have been_ thought fit, in actual experience, for\r\nthe destruction of the slave? What was done with the negro McIntosh, in\r\nthe streets of St. Louis in open daylight, and endorsed at the next\r\nsitting of the Supreme Court of the state, as transcending the sphere of\r\nlaw, because it was “an act of the majority of her most respectable\r\ncitizens”?[7] If these things are done in the green tree, what will be\r\ndone in the dry? If these things have once been done in the open streets\r\nof St. Louis, by “a majority of her most respectable citizens,” what\r\nwill be done in the lonely swamps of North Carolina, by men of the stamp\r\nof Souther and Legree?\r\n\r\nThis passage of the Revised Statutes of North Carolina is more terribly\r\nsuggestive to the imagination than any particulars into which the author\r\nof Uncle Tom’s Cabin has thought fit to enter. Let us suppose a little\r\nmelodrama quite possible to have occurred under this act of the\r\nlegislature. Suppose some luckless Prue or Peg, as in the case we have\r\njust quoted, in State _v._ Mann, getting tired of the discipline of\r\nwhipping, breaks from the overseer, clears the dogs, and gets into the\r\nswamp, and there “lies out,” as the act above graphically says. The act\r\nwhich we are considering says that _many_ slaves do this, and doubtless\r\nthey have their own best reasons for it. We all know what fascinating\r\nplaces to “lie out” in these Southern swamps are. What with alligators\r\nand moccasin snakes, mud and water, and poisonous vines, one would be\r\napt to think the situation not particularly eligible; but still, Prue\r\n“lies out” there. Perhaps in the night some husband or brother goes to\r\nsee her, taking a hog, or some animal of the plantation stock, which he\r\nhas ventured his life in killing, that she may not perish with hunger.\r\nMaster overseer walks up to master proprietor, and reports the accident;\r\nmaster proprietor mounts his horse, and assembles to his aid two\r\njustices of the peace.\r\n\r\nIn the intervals between drinking brandy and smoking cigars a\r\nproclamation is duly drawn up, summoning the contumacious Prue to\r\nsurrender, and requiring sheriff of said county to take such power as he\r\nshall think fit to go in search and pursuit of said slave; which\r\nproclamation, for Prue’s further enlightenment, is solemnly published at\r\nthe door of the court-house, and “at such other places as said justices\r\nshall direct.”[8] Let us suppose, now, that Prue, given over to hardness\r\nof heart and blindness of mind, pays no attention to all these means of\r\ngrace, put forth to draw her to the protective shadow of the patriarchal\r\nroof. Suppose, further, as a final effort of long-suffering, and to\r\nleave her utterly without excuse, the worthy magistrate rides forth in\r\nfull force,—man, horse, dog and gun,—to the very verge of the swamp, and\r\nthere proclaims aloud the merciful mandate. Suppose that, hearing the\r\nyelping of the dogs and the proclamation of the sheriff mingled\r\ntogether, and the shouts of Loker, Marks, Sambo and Quimbo, and other\r\nsuch posse, black and white, as a sheriff can generally summon on such a\r\nhunt, this very ignorant and contumacious Prue only runs deeper into the\r\nswamp, and continues obstinately “lying out,” as aforesaid;—now she is\r\nby act of the assembly _outlawed_, and, in the astounding words of the\r\nact, “it shall be lawful for any person or persons whatsoever to kill\r\nand destroy her, by such ways and means as he shall think fit, without\r\naccusation or impeachment of any crime for the same.” What awful\r\npossibilities rise to the imagination under the fearfully suggestive\r\nclause “_by such ways and means as he shall think fit_!” Such ways and\r\nmeans as ANY man shall think fit, of _any_ character, of _any_ degree of\r\nfiendish barbarity!! Such a permission to kill even a dog, by “any ways\r\nand means which anybody should think fit,” never ought to stand on the\r\nlaw-books of a Christian nation; and yet this stands against one bearing\r\nthat same humanity which Jesus Christ bore,—against one, perhaps, who,\r\nthough blinded, darkened and ignorant, he will not be ashamed to own,\r\nwhen he shall come in the glory of his Father, and all his holy angels\r\nwith him!\r\n\r\nThat this law has not been a dead letter there is sufficient proof. In\r\n1836 the following proclamation and advertisement appeared in the\r\n“Newbern (N. C.) Spectator:”\r\n\r\n  STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, LENOIR COUNTY.—Whereas complaint hath been\r\n  this day made to us, two of the justices of the peace for the said\r\n  county, by William D. Cobb, of Jones County, that two negro-slaves\r\n  belonging to him, named Ben (commonly known by the name of Ben Fox)\r\n  and Rigdon, have absented themselves from their said master’s\r\n  service, and are lurking about in the Counties of Lenoir and Jones,\r\n  committing acts of felony; these are, in the name of the state, to\r\n  command the said slaves forthwith to surrender themselves, and turn\r\n  home to their said master. And we do hereby also require the sheriff\r\n  of said County of Lenoir to make diligent search and pursuit after\r\n  the above-mentioned slaves.... And we do hereby, by virtue of an act\r\n  of assembly of this state concerning servants and slaves, intimate\r\n  and declare, if the said slaves do not surrender themselves and\r\n  return home to their master immediately after the publication of\r\n  these presents, that any person may kill or destroy said slaves by\r\n  such means as he or they think fit, without accusation or\r\n  impeachment of any crime or offence for so doing, or without\r\n  incurring any penalty or forfeiture thereby.\r\n\r\n  Given under our hands and seals, this 12th of November, 1836.\r\n\r\n                                             B. COLEMAN, J. P. [Seal.]\r\n                                             JAS. JONES, J. P. [Seal.]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  $200 REWARD.—Ran away from the subscriber, about three years ago, a\r\n  certain negro-man, named Ben, commonly known by the name of Ben Fox;\r\n  also one other negro, by the name of Rigdon, who ran away on the 8th\r\n  of this month.\r\n\r\n  I will give the reward of $100 for each of the above negroes, to be\r\n  delivered to me, or confined in the jail of Lenoir or Jones County,\r\n  _or for the killing of them, so that I can see them_.\r\n\r\n  _Nov. 12, 1836._\r\n\r\n                                                           W. D. COBB.\r\n\r\nThat this act was _not_ a dead letter, also, was plainly implied in the\r\nprotective act first quoted. If slaves were not, as a matter of fact,\r\never outlawed, why does the act formally recognize such a\r\nclass?—“provided that this act shall not extend to the killing of any\r\nslave _outlawed_ by any act of the assembly.” This language sufficiently\r\nindicates the existence of the custom.\r\n\r\nFurther than this, the statute-book of 1821 contained two acts: the\r\nfirst of which provides that all masters in certain counties, who have\r\nhad slaves killed in consequence of outlawry, shall have a claim on the\r\ntreasury of the state for their value, unless cruel treatment of the\r\nslave be proved on the part of the master: the second act extends the\r\nbenefits of the latter provision to all the counties in the state.[9]\r\n\r\nFinally, there is evidence that this act of outlawry was executed so\r\nrecently as the year 1850,—the year in which “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” was\r\nwritten. See the following from the Wilmington Journal of December 13,\r\n1850:\r\n\r\n  STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, NEW HANOVER COUNTY.—Whereas complaint upon\r\n  oath hath this day been made to us, two of the justices of the peace\r\n  for the said state and county aforesaid, by Guilford Horn, of\r\n  Edgecombe County, that a certain male slave belonging to him, named\r\n  Harry, a carpenter by trade, about forty years old, five feet five\r\n  inches high, or thereabouts; yellow complexion; stout built; with a\r\n  scar on his left leg (from the cut of an axe); has very thick lips;\r\n  eyes deep sunk in his head; forehead very square; tolerably loud\r\n  voice; has lost one or two of his upper teeth; and has a very dark\r\n  spot on his jaw, supposed to be a mark,—hath absented himself from\r\n  his master’s service, and is supposed to be lurking about in this\r\n  county, committing acts of felony or other misdeeds; these are,\r\n  therefore, in the name of the state aforesaid, to command the said\r\n  slave forthwith to surrender himself and return home to his said\r\n  master; and we do hereby, by virtue of the act of assembly in such\r\n  cases made and provided, intimate and declare that if the said slave\r\n  Harry doth not surrender himself and return home immediately after\r\n  the publication of these presents, that any person or persons may\r\n  KILL and DESTROY the said slave by such means as he or they may\r\n  think fit, without accusation or impeachment of any crime or offence\r\n  for so doing, and without incurring any penalty or forfeiture\r\n  thereby.\r\n\r\n  Given under our hands and seals, this 29th day of June, 1850.\r\n\r\n                                      JAMES T. MILLER, J. P.   [Seal.]\r\n                                      W. C. BETTENCOURT, J. P. [Seal.]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS REWARD will be paid for the\r\n  delivery of the said Harry to me at Tosnott Depot, Edgecombe County,\r\n  or for his confinement in any jail in the state, so that I can get\r\n  him; or _One Hundred and Fifty Dollars will be given for his head_.\r\n\r\n  He was lately heard from in Newbern, where he called himself Henry\r\n  Barnes (or Burns), and will be likely to continue the same name, or\r\n  assume that of Copage or Farmer. He has a free mulatto woman for a\r\n  wife, by the name of Sally Bozeman, who has lately removed to\r\n  Wilmington, and lives in that part of the town called Texas, where\r\n  he will likely be lurking.\r\n\r\n  Masters of vessels are particularly cautioned against harboring or\r\n  concealing the said negro on board their vessels, as the full\r\n  penalty of the law will be rigorously enforced.\r\n\r\n  _June 29th, 1850._\r\n\r\n                                                        GUILFORD HORN.\r\n\r\nThere is an inkling of history and romance about the description of this\r\nsame Harry, who is thus publicly set up to be killed in any way that any\r\nof the negro-hunters of the swamps may think the most piquant and\r\nenlivening. It seems he is a carpenter,—a powerfully made man, whose\r\nthews and sinews might be a profitable acquisition to himself. It\r\nappears also that he has a wife, and the advertiser intimates that\r\npossibly he may be caught prowling about somewhere in her vicinity. This\r\nindicates sagacity in the writer, certainly. Married men generally have\r\na way of liking the society of their wives; and it strikes us, from what\r\nwe know of the nature of carpenters here in New England, that Harry was\r\nnot peculiar in this respect. Let us further notice the portrait of\r\nHarry: “_Eyes deep sunk in his head;—forehead very square_.” This\r\npicture reminds us of what a persecuting old ecclesiastic once said, in\r\nthe days of the Port-Royalists, of a certain truculent abbess, who stood\r\nobstinately to a certain course, in the face of the whole power,\r\ntemporal and spiritual, of the Romish church, in spite of fining,\r\nimprisoning, starving, whipping, beating, and other enlightening\r\nargumentative processes, not wholly peculiar, it seems, to that age.\r\n“You will never subdue that woman,” said the ecclesiastic, who was a\r\nphrenologist before his age; “she’s got a _square head_, and I have\r\nalways noticed that people with _square heads_ never can be turned out\r\nof their course.” We think it very probable that Harry, with his “square\r\nhead,” is just one of this sort. He is probably one of those articles\r\nwhich would be extremely valuable, if the owner could only get the use\r\nof him. His head is well enough, but he will use it for himself. It is\r\nof no use to any one but the wearer; and the master seems to symbolize\r\nthis state of things, by offering twenty-five dollars more for the head\r\nwithout the body, than he is willing to give for head, man and all. Poor\r\nHarry! We wonder whether they have caught him yet; or whether the\r\nimpenetrable thickets, the poisonous miasma, the deadly snakes, and the\r\nunwieldy alligators of the swamps, more humane than the slave-hunter,\r\nhave interposed their uncouth and loathsome forms to guard the only\r\nfastness in Carolina where a slave can live in freedom.\r\n\r\nIt is not, then, in mere poetic fiction that the humane and graceful pen\r\nof Longfellow has drawn the following picture:\r\n\r\n             “In the dark fens of the Dismal Swamp\r\n               The hunted negro lay;\r\n             He saw the fire of the midnight camp,\r\n             And heard at times the horse’s tramp,\r\n               And a bloodhound’s distant bay.\r\n\r\n             “Where will-o’the-wisps and glow-worms shine,\r\n               In bulrush and in brake;\r\n             Where waving mosses shroud the pine,\r\n             And the cedar grows, and the poisonous vine\r\n               Is spotted like the snake;\r\n\r\n             “Where hardly a human foot could pass,\r\n               Or a human heart would dare,—\r\n             On the quaking turf of the green morass\r\n             He crouched in the rank and tangled grass,\r\n               Like a wild beast in his lair.\r\n\r\n             “A poor old slave! infirm and lame,\r\n               Great scars deformed his face;\r\n             On his forehead he bore the brand of shame,\r\n             And the rags that hid his mangled frame\r\n               Were the livery of disgrace.\r\n\r\n             “All things above were bright and fair,\r\n               All things were glad and free;\r\n             Lithe squirrels darted here and there,\r\n             And wild birds filled the echoing air\r\n               With songs of liberty!\r\n\r\n             “On him alone was the doom of pain,\r\n               From the morning of his birth;\r\n             On him alone the curse of Cain[10]\r\n             Fell like the flail on the garnered grain,\r\n               And struck him to the earth.”\r\n\r\nThe civilized world may and will ask, in what state this law has been\r\ndrawn, and passed, and revised, and allowed to appear at the present day\r\non the revised statute-book, and to be executed in the year of our Lord\r\n1850, as the above-cited extracts from its most respectable journals\r\nshow. Is it some heathen, Kurdish tribe, some nest of pirates, some\r\nhorde of barbarians, where destructive gods are worshipped, and\r\nlibations to their honor poured from human skulls? The civilized world\r\nwill not believe it,—but it is actually a fact, that this law has been\r\nmade, and is still kept in force, by men in every other respect than\r\nwhat relates to their slave-code as high-minded, as enlightened, as\r\nhumane, as any men in Christendom;—by citizens of a state which glories\r\nin the blood and hereditary Christian institutions of Scotland.\r\nCuriosity to know what sort of men the legislators of North Carolina\r\nmight be, led the writer to examine with some attention the proceedings\r\nand debates of the convention of that state, called to amend its\r\nconstitution, which assembled at Raleigh, June 4th, 1835. It is but\r\njustice to say that in these proceedings, in which all the different and\r\nperhaps conflicting interests of the various parts of the state were\r\ndiscussed, there was an exhibition of candor, fairness and moderation,\r\nof gentlemanly honor and courtesy in the treatment of opposing claims,\r\nand of an overruling sense of the obligations of law and religion, which\r\ncertainly have not always been equally conspicuous in the proceedings of\r\ndeliberative bodies in such cases. It simply goes to show that one can\r\njudge nothing of the religion or of the humanity of individuals from\r\nwhat seems to us objectionable practice, where they have been educated\r\nunder a system entirely incompatible with both. Such is the very\r\nequivocal character of what we call virtue.\r\n\r\nIt could not be for a moment supposed that such men as Judge Ruffin, or\r\nmany of the gentlemen who figure in the debates alluded to, would ever\r\nthink of availing themselves of the savage permissions of such a law.\r\nBut what then? It follows that the law is a direct permission, letting\r\nloose upon the defenceless slave that class of men who exist in every\r\ncommunity, who have no conscience, no honor, no shame,—who are too far\r\nbelow public opinion to be restrained by that, and from whom accordingly\r\nthis provision of the law takes away the only available restraint of\r\ntheir fiendish natures. Such men are not peculiar to the South. It is\r\nunhappily too notorious that they exist everywhere,—in England, in New\r\nEngland, and the world over; but they can only arrive at full maturity\r\nin wickedness under a system where the law clothes them with absolute\r\nand irresponsible power.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  This man was burned alive.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  The old statute of 1741 had some features still more edifying. That\r\n  provides that said “proclamation shall be published on a Sabbath day,\r\n  at the door of every church or chapel, or, for want of such, at the\r\n  place where divine service shall be performed in the said county, by\r\n  the parish clerk or reader, _immediately_ after divine service.”\r\n  _Potter’s Revisal_, i. 166. What a peculiar appropriateness there must\r\n  have been in this proclamation, particularly after a sermon on the\r\n  love of Christ, or an exposition of the text “thou shalt love thy\r\n  neighbor as thyself!”\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Potter’s Revisal, ch. 467, § 2.]\r\n\r\n  _Be it further enacted_, That when any slave shall be legally outlawed\r\n  in any of the counties within mentioned, the owner of which shall\r\n  reside in one of the said counties, and the said slave shall be killed\r\n  in consequence of such outlawry, the value of such slave shall be\r\n  ascertained by a jury which shall be empanelled at the succeeding\r\n  court of the county where the said slave was killed, and a certificate\r\n  of such valuation shall be given by the clerk of the court to the\r\n  owner of said slave, who shall be entitled to receive two-thirds of\r\n  such valuation from the sheriff of the county wherein the slave was\r\n  killed. [Extended to other counties in 1797.—Potter, ch. 480, § 1.]\r\n  _now obsolete_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Gen. 4:14.—“And it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me\r\n  shall slay me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n  PROTECTIVE ACTS OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND LOUISIANA.—THE IRON COLLAR OF\r\n                     LOUISIANA AND NORTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far by way of considering the protective acts of North Carolina,\r\nGeorgia and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nCertain miscellaneous protective acts of various other states will now\r\nbe cited, merely as specimens of the spirit of legislation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud, p. 39. 2 Brevard’s Digest, p. 241.]\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, the act of 1740 punished the wilful, deliberate\r\nmurder of a slave by disfranchisement, and by a fine of seven hundred\r\npounds current money, or, in default of payment, imprisonment for seven\r\nyears. But the wilful murder of a slave, in the sense contemplated in\r\nthis law, is a crime which would not often occur. The kind of murder\r\nwhich was most frequent among masters or overseers was guarded against\r\nby another section of the same act,—_how adequately_ the reader will\r\njudge for himself, from the following quotation:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud’s Sketch, p. 40. 2 Brevard’s Digest, 241. James’\r\n           Digest, 392.]\r\n\r\n  If any person shall, on a sudden heat or passion, or by _undue\r\n  correction_, kill his own slave, or the slave of any other person,\r\n  he shall forfeit the sum of _three hundred and fifty pounds_ current\r\n  money.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 the act punishing the wilful murder of the slave only with fine\r\nor imprisonment was mainly repealed, and it was enacted that such crime\r\nshould be punished by death; but the latter section, which relates to\r\nkilling the slave in sudden heat or passion, or by undue correction, has\r\nbeen altered only by _diminishing_ the pecuniary penalty to a fine of\r\nfive hundred dollars, authorizing also imprisonment for six months.\r\n\r\nThe next protective statute to be noticed is the following from the act\r\nof 1740, South Carolina.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud, p. 40. 2 Brevard’s Digest, 241.]\r\n\r\n  In case any person shall wilfully cut out the tongue, put out the\r\n  eye, * * * or cruelly scald, burn, or deprive any slave of any limb,\r\n  or member, or shall inflict any other cruel punishment, _other than_\r\n  by whipping or beating with a horse-whip, cowskin, switch or small\r\n  stick, or by putting irons on, or confining or imprisoning such\r\n  slave, every such person shall, for every such offence, forfeit the\r\n  sum of one hundred pounds, current money.\r\n\r\nThe language of this law, like many other of these protective\r\nenactments, is exceedingly suggestive; the first suggestion that occurs\r\nis, What sort of an institution, and what sort of a state of society is\r\nit, that called out a law worded like this? Laws are generally not made\r\nagainst practices that do not exist, and exist with some degree of\r\nfrequency.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of slavery are very fond of comparing it to the apprentice\r\nsystem of England and America. Let us suppose that in the British\r\nParliament, or in a New England Legislature, the following law is\r\nproposed, under the title of An Act for the Protection of Apprentices,\r\n&c. &c.\r\n\r\n  In case any person shall wilfully cut out the tongue, put out the\r\n  eye, or cruelly scald, burn, or deprive any apprentice of any limb\r\n  or member, or shall inflict any other cruel punishment, other than\r\n  by whipping or beating with a horse-whip, cowskin, switch or small\r\n  stick, or by putting irons on or confining or imprisoning such\r\n  apprentice, every such person shall, for every such offence, forfeit\r\n  the sum of one hundred pounds, current money.\r\n\r\nWhat a sensation such a proposed law would make in England may be best\r\nleft for Englishmen to say; but in New England it would simply\r\nconstitute the proposer a candidate for Bedlam. Yet that such a statute\r\nis necessary in South Carolina is evident enough, if we reflect that,\r\nbecause there is no such statute in Virginia, it has been decided that a\r\nwretch who perpetrates all these enormities on a slave cannot even be\r\nindicted for it, unless the slave dies.\r\n\r\nBut let us look further:—What is to be the penalty when any of these\r\nfiendish things are done?\r\n\r\nWhy, the man forfeits a hundred pounds, current money. Surely he ought\r\nto pay as much as that for doing so very unnecessary an act, when the\r\nLegislature bountifully allows him to inflict any torture which\r\nrevengeful ingenuity could devise, by means of horse-whip, cowskin,\r\nswitch or small stick, or putting irons on, or confining and\r\nimprisoning. One would surely think that here was sufficient scope and\r\nvariety of legalized means of torture to satisfy any ordinary appetite\r\nfor vengeance. It would appear decidedly that any more piquant varieties\r\nof agony ought to be an extra charge. The advocates of slavery are fond\r\nof comparing the situation of the slave with that of the English\r\nlaborer. We are not aware that the English laborer has been so\r\nunfortunate as to be protected by any enactment like this, since the\r\ndays of villeinage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud’s Sketch, p. 41. 1 Mar. Digest, 654.]\r\n\r\nJudge Stroud says, that the same law, substantially, has been adopted in\r\nLouisiana. It is true that the civil code of Louisiana thus expresses\r\nits humane intentions.\r\n\r\n  The slave is entirely subject to the will of his master, who may\r\n  correct and chastise him, though not with unusual rigor, nor so as\r\n  to maim or mutilate him, or to expose him to the danger of loss of\r\n  life, or to cause his death.—_Civil Code of Louisiana, Article 173._\r\n\r\nThe expression “unusual rigor” is suggestive, again. It will afford\r\nlarge latitude for a jury, in states where slaves are in the habit of\r\n_dying_ under _moderate_ correction; where outlawed slaves may be killed\r\nby any means which any person thinks fit; and where laws have to be\r\nspecifically made against scalding, burning, cutting out the tongue,\r\nputting out the eye, &c. What will be thought unusual rigor? This is a\r\nquestion, certainly, upon which persons in states not so constituted can\r\nhave no means of forming an opinion.\r\n\r\nIn one of the newspaper extracts with which we prefaced our account, the\r\nfollowing protective act of Louisiana is alluded to, as being\r\nparticularly satisfactory and efficient. We give it, as quoted by Judge\r\nStroud in his Sketch, page 58, giving his reference.\r\n\r\n  No master shall be compelled to sell his slave, but in one of two\r\n  cases, to wit: the first, when, being only co-proprietor of the\r\n  slave, his co-proprietor demands the sale, in order to make\r\n  partition of the property; _second_, when the master shall be\r\n  CONVICTED of cruel treatment of his slave, AND THE JUDGE SHALL DEEM\r\n  IT PROPER TO PRONOUNCE, besides the penalty established for such\r\n  cases, that the slave shall be sold at public auction, in order to\r\n  place him out of the reach of the power which his master has\r\n  abused.—_Civil Code, Art. 192._\r\n\r\nThe question for a jury to determine in this case is, What is cruel\r\ntreatment of a slave? Now, if all these barbarities which have been\r\nsanctioned by the legislative acts which we have quoted are not held to\r\nbe cruel treatment, the question is, What _is_ cruel treatment of a\r\nslave?\r\n\r\nEverything that fiendish barbarity could desire can be effected under\r\nthe protection of the law of South Carolina, which, as we have just\r\nshown, exists also in Louisiana. It is true the law restrains from some\r\nparticular forms of cruelty. If any person has a mind to scald or burn\r\nhis slave,—and it seems, by the statute, that there have been such\r\npeople,—these statutes merely provide that he shall do it in decent\r\nprivacy; for, as the very keystone of Southern jurisprudence is the\r\nrejection of colored testimony, such an outrage, if perpetrated most\r\ndeliberately in the presence of hundreds of slaves, could not be proved\r\nupon the master.\r\n\r\nIt is to be supposed that the fiendish people whom such statutes have in\r\nview will generally have enough of common sense not to perform it in the\r\npresence of white witnesses, since this simple act of prudence will\r\nrender them entirely safe in doing whatever they have a mind to. We are\r\ntold, it is true, as we have been reminded by our friend in the\r\nnewspaper before quoted, that in Louisiana the deficiency caused by the\r\nrejection of negro testimony is supplied by the following most\r\nremarkable provision of the Code Noir:\r\n\r\n  If any slave be mutilated, beaten, or ill treated, contrary to the\r\n  true intent and meaning of this section, when no one shall be\r\n  present, in such case the owner, or other person having the charge\r\n  or management of said slave thus mutilated, shall be deemed\r\n  responsible and guilty of the said offence, and shall be\r\n  prosecuted without further evidence, unless the said owner, or\r\n  other person so as aforesaid, can prove the contrary by means of\r\n  good and sufficient evidence, or can clear himself by his own\r\n  oath, which said oath every court under the cognizance of which\r\n  such offence shall have been examined and tried is by this act\r\n  authorized to administer.—_Code Noir. Crimes and Offences_, 56.\r\n  xvii. _Rev. Stat._ 1852, p. 550, § 141.\r\n\r\nWould one have supposed that sensible people could ever publish as a law\r\nsuch a specimen of utter legislative nonsense—so ridiculous on the very\r\nface of it!\r\n\r\nThe object is to bring to justice those fiendish people who burn, scald,\r\nmutilate, &c. How is this done? Why, it is enacted that the fact of\r\nfinding the slave in this condition shall be held presumption against\r\nthe owner or overseer, unless—unless what? Why, unless he will prove to\r\nthe contrary,—or swear to the contrary, it is no matter which—either\r\nwill answer the purpose. The question is, If a man is bad enough to do\r\nthese things, will he not be bad enough to swear falsely? As if men who\r\nare the incarnation of cruelty, as supposed by the deeds in question,\r\nwould not have sufficient intrepidity of conscience to compass a false\r\noath!\r\n\r\nWhat was this law ever made for? Can any one imagine?\r\n\r\nUpon this whole subject, we may quote the language of Judge Stroud, who\r\nthus sums up the whole amount of the protective laws for the slave, in\r\nthe United States of America:\r\n\r\n  Upon a fair review of what has been written on the subject of this\r\n  proposition, the result is found to be—that the master’s power to\r\n  inflict corporal punishment to any extent, short of life and limb,\r\n  is fully sanctioned by law, in _all_ the slave-holding states; that\r\n  the master, in at least two states, is _expressly_ protected in\r\n  using the horse-whip and cowskin as instruments for _beating_ his\r\n  slave; that he may with entire impunity, in the same states, load\r\n  his slave with irons, or subject him to perpetual imprisonment,\r\n  whenever he may so choose; that, for cruelly scalding, wilfully\r\n  cutting out the tongue, putting out an eye, and for any other\r\n  dismemberment, if proved, a fine of one hundred pounds currency only\r\n  is incurred in South Carolina; that, though in all the states the\r\n  wilful, deliberate and malicious murder of the slave is now\r\n  _directed_ to be punished with death, yet, as in the case of a\r\n  _white_ offender none except whites can give evidence, a conviction\r\n  can seldom, if ever, take place.—_Stroud’s Sketch_, p. 43.\r\n\r\nOne very singular antithesis of two laws of Louisiana will still further\r\nshow that deadness of public sentiment on cruelty to the slave which is\r\nan inseparable attendant on the system. It will be recollected that the\r\nremarkable _protective_ law of South Carolina, with respect to scalding,\r\nburning, cutting out the tongue, and putting out the eye of the slave,\r\nhas been substantially enacted in Louisiana; and that the penalty for a\r\nman’s doing these things there, if he has not sense enough to do it\r\nprivately, is not more than five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nNow, compare this other statute of Louisiana, (Rev. Stat. 1852, p. 552,\r\n§ 151):\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud, p. 41.]\r\n\r\n  If any person or persons, &c., shall cut or break any iron chain or\r\n  collar, which any master of slaves should have used, in order to\r\n  prevent the running away or escape of any such slave or slaves, such\r\n  person or persons so offending shall, on conviction, &c., be fined\r\n  not less than two hundred dollars, nor exceeding one thousand\r\n  dollars; and suffer imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years,\r\n  nor less than six months.—_Act of Assembly of March 6, 1819.\r\n  Pamphlet, page 64._\r\n\r\nSome Englishmen may naturally ask, “What is this iron collar which the\r\nLegislature have thought worthy of being protected by a special act?” On\r\nthis subject will be presented the testimony of an unimpeachable\r\nwitness, Miss Sarah M. Grimké, a personal friend of the author. “Miss\r\nGrimké is a daughter of the late Judge Grimké, of the Supreme Court of\r\nSouth Carolina, and sister of the late Hon. Thomas S. Grimké.” She is\r\nnow a member of the Society of Friends, and resides in Bellville, New\r\nJersey. The statement given is of a kind that its author did not mean to\r\ngive, nor wish to give, and never would have given, had it not been made\r\nnecessary to illustrate this passage in the slave-law. The account\r\noccurs in a statement which Miss Grimké furnished to her brother-in-law,\r\nMr. Weld, and has been before the public ever since 1839, in his work\r\nentitled _Slavery as It Is_, p. 22.\r\n\r\n  A handsome mulatto woman, about eighteen or twenty years of age,\r\n  whose independent spirit could not brook the degradation of slavery,\r\n  was in the habit of running away: for this offence she had been\r\n  repeatedly sent by her master and mistress to be whipped by the\r\n  keeper of the Charleston workhouse. This had been done with such\r\n  inhuman severity as to lacerate her back in a most shocking manner;\r\n  a finger could not be laid between the cuts. But the love of liberty\r\n  was too strong to be annihilated by torture; and, as a last resort,\r\n  she was whipped at several different times, and kept a close\r\n  prisoner. A heavy iron collar, with three long prongs projecting\r\n  from it, was placed round her neck, and a strong and sound front\r\n  tooth was extracted, to serve as a mark to describe her, in case of\r\n  escape. Her sufferings at this time were agonizing; she could lie in\r\n  no position but on her back, which was sore from scourgings, as I\r\n  can testify from personal inspection; and her only place of rest was\r\n  the floor, on a blanket. These outrages were committed in a family\r\n  where the mistress daily read the Scriptures, and assembled her\r\n  children for family worship. She was accounted, and was really, so\r\n  far as almsgiving was concerned, a charitable woman, and\r\n  tender-hearted to the poor; and yet this suffering slave, who was\r\n  the seamstress of the family, was continually in her presence,\r\n  sitting in her chamber to sew, or engaged in her other household\r\n  work, with her lacerated and bleeding back, her mutilated mouth, and\r\n  heavy iron collar, without, so far as appeared, exciting any\r\n  feelings of compassion.\r\n\r\nThis iron collar the author has often heard of from sources equally\r\nauthentic.[11] That one will meet with it every day in walking the\r\nstreets, is not probable; but that it must have been used with some\r\ngreat degree of frequency, is evident from the fact of a law being\r\nthought necessary to protect it. But look at the penalty of the two\r\n_protective_ laws! The fiendish cruelties described in the act of South\r\nCarolina cost the perpetrator not more than five hundred dollars, if he\r\ndoes them before white people. The act of humanity costs from two\r\nhundred to one thousand dollars, and imprisonment from six months to two\r\nyears, according to discretion of court! What public sentiment was it\r\nwhich made these laws?\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  The iron collar was also in vogue in North Carolina, as the following\r\n  extract from the statute-book will show. The wearers of this article\r\n  of apparel certainly have some reason to complain of the “tyranny of\r\n  fashion.”\r\n\r\n  “When the keeper of the said public jail shall, by direction of such\r\n  court as aforesaid, let out any negro or runaway to hire, to any\r\n  person or persons whomsoever, the said keeper shall, at the time of\r\n  his delivery, cause an iron collar to be put on the neck of such negro\r\n  or runaway, with the letters P. G. stamped thereon; and thereafter the\r\n  said keeper shall not be answerable for any escape of the said negro\r\n  or runaway.”—_Potter’s Revisal_, i. 162.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n      PROTECTIVE ACTS WITH REGARD TO FOOD AND RAIMENT, LABOR, ETC.\r\n\r\n  Illustrative Drama of Tom _v._ Legree, under the Law of South\r\n    Carolina.—Separation of Parent and Child.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wheeler, p. 220. State _v._ Sue, Cameron & Norwood’s C. Rep.\r\n           54.]\r\n\r\nHaving finished the consideration of the laws which protect the life and\r\nlimb of the slave, the reader may feel a curiosity to know something of\r\nthe provisions by which he is protected in regard to food and clothing,\r\nand from the exactions of excessive labor. It is true, there are\r\nmultitudes of men in the Northern States who would say, at once, that\r\nsuch enactments, on the very face of them, must be superfluous and\r\nabsurd. “What!” they say, “are not the slaves property? and is it likely\r\nthat any man will impair the market value of his own property by not\r\ngiving them sufficient food or clothing, or by over-working them?” This\r\nprocess of reasoning appears to have been less convincing to the\r\nlegislators of Southern States than to gentlemen generally at the North;\r\nsince, as Judge Taylor says, “the act of 1786 (Iredell’s Revisal, p.\r\n588) does, in the preamble, recognize the fact, that _many_ persons, by\r\ncruel treatment of their slaves, cause them to commit crimes for which\r\nthey are executed;” and the judge further explains this language, by\r\nsaying, “The cruel treatment here alluded to must consist in withholding\r\nfrom them the necessaries of life; and the crimes thus resulting are\r\nsuch as are necessary to furnish them with food and raiment.”\r\n\r\nThe State of South Carolina, in the act of 1740 (see Stroud’s Sketch, p.\r\n28), had a section with the following language in its preamble:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud, p. 29.]\r\n\r\n  Whereas _many_ owners of slaves, and _others_ who have the care,\r\n  management, and overseeing of slaves, _do confine them so closely to\r\n  hard labor that they have not sufficient time for natural rest_;—\r\n\r\nAnd the law goes on to enact that the slave shall not work more than\r\nfifteen hours a day in summer, and fourteen in winter. Judge Stroud\r\nmakes it appear that in three of the slave states the time allotted for\r\nwork to convicts in prison, whose punishment is to consist in hard\r\nlabor, cannot exceed _ten_ hours, even in the summer months.\r\n\r\nThis was the protective act of South Carolina, designed to reform the\r\nabusive practices of masters who confined their slaves so closely that\r\nthey had not time for natural rest! What sort of habits of thought do\r\nthese humane provisions show, in the makers of them? In order to protect\r\nthe slave from what they consider undue exaction, they humanely provide\r\nthat he shall be obliged to work only four or five hours longer than the\r\nconvicts in the prison of the neighboring state! In the Island of\r\nJamaica, besides many holidays which were accorded by law to the slave,\r\nten hours a day was the extent to which he was compelled by law\r\nordinarily to work.—See _Stroud_, p. 29.\r\n\r\nWith regard to protective acts concerning food and clothing, Judge\r\nStroud gives the following example from the legislation of South\r\nCarolina. The author gives it as quoted by _Stroud_, p. 32.\r\n\r\n  In case any person, &c., who shall be the owner, or who shall have\r\n  the care, government or charge, of any slave or slaves, shall deny,\r\n  neglect or refuse to allow, such slave or slaves, &c., sufficient\r\n  clothing, covering or food, it shall and may be lawful for any\r\n  person or persons, on behalf of such slave or slaves, to make\r\n  complaint to the next neighboring justice in the parish where such\r\n  slave or slaves live, or are usually employed, * * * and the said\r\n  justice shall summons the party against whom such complaint shall be\r\n  made, and shall inquire of, hear and determine, the same; and, if\r\n  the said justice shall find the said complaint to be true, or that\r\n  such person will not exculpate or clear himself from the charge, by\r\n  his or her own oath, which _such person shall be at liberty to do in\r\n  all cases_ where positive proof is not given of the offence, such\r\n  justice shall and may make such orders upon the same, for the relief\r\n  of such slave or slaves, as he in his discretion shall think fit;\r\n  and shall and may set and impose a fine or penalty on any person who\r\n  shall offend in the premises, in any sum not exceeding twenty pounds\r\n  current money, for each offence.—_2 Brevard’s, Dig. 241._ Also\r\n  _Cobb’s Dig. 827_.\r\n\r\nA similar law obtains in Louisiana.—_Rev. Stat._ 1852, p. 557, § 166.\r\n\r\nNow, would not anybody think, from the virtuous solemnity and gravity of\r\nthis act, that it was intended in some way to amount to something? Let\r\nus give a little sketch, to show how much it does amount to. Angelina\r\nGrimké Weld, sister to Sarah Grimké, before quoted, gives the following\r\naccount of the situation of slaves on plantations:[12]\r\n\r\n  And here let me say, that the treatment of _plantation_ slaves\r\n  cannot be fully known, except by the poor sufferers themselves, and\r\n  their drivers and overseers. In a multitude of instances, even the\r\n  master can know very little of the actual condition of his own\r\n  field-slaves, and his wife and daughters far less. A few facts\r\n  concerning my own family will show this. Our permanent residence was\r\n  in Charleston; our country-seat (Bellemont) was two hundred miles\r\n  distant, in the north western part of the state, where, for some\r\n  years, our family spent a few months annually. Our _plantation_ was\r\n  three miles from this family mansion. There all the field-slaves\r\n  lived and worked. Occasionally,—once a month, perhaps,—some of the\r\n  family would ride over to the plantation; but I never visited the\r\n  _fields where the slaves were at work_, and knew almost nothing of\r\n  their condition; but this I do know, that the overseers who had\r\n  charge of them were generally unprincipled and intemperate men. But\r\n  I rejoice to know that the general treatment of slaves in that\r\n  region of country was far milder than on the plantations in the\r\n  lower country.\r\n\r\n  Throughout all the eastern and middle portions of the state, the\r\n  planters very rarely reside permanently on their plantations. They\r\n  have almost invariably _two_ residences, and spend less than half\r\n  the year on their estates. Even while spending a few months on them,\r\n  politics, field-sports, races, speculations, journeys, visits,\r\n  company, literary pursuits, &c., absorb so much of their time, that\r\n  they must, to a considerable extent, take the condition of their\r\n  slaves on _trust_, from the reports of their overseers. I make this\r\n  statement, because these slaveholders (the wealthier class) are, I\r\n  believe, almost the only ones who visit the North with their\r\n  families; and Northern opinions of slavery are based chiefly on\r\n  their testimony.\r\n\r\nWith regard to overseers, Miss Grimké’s testimony is further borne out\r\nby the universal acknowledgment of Southern owners. A description of\r\nthis class of beings is furnished by Mr. Wirt, in his Life of Patrick\r\nHenry, page 34. “Last and lowest,” he says, [of different classes in\r\nsociety] “a _feculum_ of beings called overseers,—a most abject,\r\ndegraded, unprincipled race.” Now, suppose, while the master is in\r\nCharleston, enjoying literary leisure, the slaves on some Bellemont or\r\nother plantation, getting tired of being hungry and cold, form\r\nthemselves into a committee of the whole, to see what is to be done. A\r\nbroad-shouldered, courageous fellow, whom we will call Tom, declares it\r\nis too bad, and he won’t stand it any longer; and, having by some means\r\nbecome acquainted with this benevolent protective act, resolves to make\r\nan appeal to the horns of this legislative altar. Tom talks stoutly,\r\nhaving just been bought on to the place, and been used to better\r\nquarters elsewhere. The women and children perhaps admire, but the\r\nvenerable elders of the plantation,—Sambo, Cudge, Pomp and old Aunt\r\nDinah,—tell him he better mind himself, and keep clar o’ dat ar. Tom,\r\nbeing young and progressive, does not regard these conservative maxims;\r\nhe is determined that, if there is such a thing as justice to be got, he\r\nwill have it. After considerable research, he finds some white man in\r\nthe neighborhood verdant enough to enter the complaint for him. Master\r\nLegree finds himself, one sunshiny, pleasant morning, walked off to some\r\nJustice Dogberry’s, to answer to the charge of not giving his niggers\r\nenough to eat and wear. We will call the infatuated white man who has\r\nundertaken this fool’s errand Master Shallow. Let us imagine a\r\nscene:—Legree, standing carelessly with his hands in his pockets,\r\nrolling a quid of tobacco in his mouth; Justice Dogberry, seated in all\r\nthe majesty of law, reinforced by a decanter of whiskey and some\r\ntumblers, intended to assist in illuminating the intellect in such\r\nobscure cases.\r\n\r\n_Justice Dogberry._ Come, gentlemen, take a little something, to begin\r\nwith. Mr. Legree, sit down; sit down, Mr.—a’ what’s-your-name?—Mr.\r\nShallow.\r\n\r\nMr. Legree and Mr. Shallow each sit down, and take their tumbler of\r\nwhiskey and water. After some little conversation, the justice\r\nintroduces the business as follows:\r\n\r\n“Now, about this nigger business. Gentlemen, you know the act\r\nof——um—um,—where the deuce _is_ that act? [Fumbling an old law-book.]\r\nHow plagued did you ever hear of that act, Shallow? I’m sure I’m forgot\r\nall about it;—O! here ‘tis. Well, Mr. Shallow, the act says you must\r\nmake proof, you observe.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Shallow._ [Stuttering and hesitating.] Good land! why, don’t\r\neverybody see that them ar niggers are most starved? Only see how ragged\r\nthey are!\r\n\r\n_Justice._ I can’t say as I’ve observed it particular. Seem to be very\r\nwell contented.\r\n\r\n_Shallow._ [Eagerly.] But just ask Pomp, or Sambo, or Dinah, or Tom!\r\n\r\n_Justice Dogberry._ [With dignity.] I’m astonished at you, Mr. Shallow!\r\nYou think of producing negro testimony? I hope I know the law better\r\nthan that! We must have direct proof, you know.\r\n\r\nShallow is posed; Legree significantly takes another tumbler of whiskey\r\nand water, and Justice Dogberry gives a long ahe-a-um. After a few\r\nmoments the justice speaks:\r\n\r\n“Well, after all, I suppose, Mr. Legree, you wouldn’t have any\r\nobjections to swarin’ off; that settles it all, you know.”\r\n\r\nAs swearing is what Mr. Legree is rather more accustomed to do than\r\nanything else that could be named, a more appropriate termination of the\r\naffair could not be suggested; and he swears, accordingly, to any\r\nextent, and with any fulness and variety of oath that could be desired;\r\nand thus the little affair terminates. But it does not terminate thus\r\nfor Tom or Sambo, Dinah, or any others who have been alluded to for\r\nauthority. What will happen to them, when Mr. Legree comes home, had\r\nbetter be left to conjecture.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed, by the author of certain paragraphs quoted at the\r\ncommencement of Part II., that there exist in Louisiana ample protective\r\nacts to prevent the separation of young children from their mothers.\r\nThis writer appears to be in the enjoyment of an amiable ignorance and\r\nunsophisticated innocence with regard to the workings of human society\r\ngenerally, which is, on the whole, rather refreshing. For, on a certain\r\nincident in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” which represented Cassy’s little\r\ndaughter as having been sold from her, he makes the following _naïf_\r\nremark:\r\n\r\n  Now, the reader will perhaps be surprised to know that such an\r\n  incident as the sale of Cassy apart from Eliza, upon which the whole\r\n  interest of the foregoing narrative hinges, never could have taken\r\n  place in Louisiana, and that the bill of sale for Eliza would not\r\n  have been worth the paper it was written on.—Observe. George Shelby\r\n  states that Eliza was _eight or nine years old_ at the time his\r\n  father purchased her in New Orleans. Let us again look at the\r\n  statute-book of Louisiana.\r\n\r\n  In the _Code Noir_ we find it set down that\r\n\r\n  “Every person is expressly prohibited from selling separately from\r\n  their mothers _the children who shall not have attained the full age\r\n  of ten years_.”\r\n\r\n  And this humane provision is strengthened by a statute, one clause\r\n  of which runs as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Be it further enacted, that if any person or persons shall sell the\r\n  mother of any slave child or children _under the age of ten years,\r\n  separate from said child or children, or shall, the mother living,\r\n  sell any slave child or children of ten years of age or under,\r\n  separate from said mother_, such person or persons shall incur the\r\n  penalty of the sixth section of this act.”\r\n\r\n  This penalty is a fine of not less than one thousand nor more than\r\n  two thousand dollars, and imprisonment in the public jail for a\r\n  period of not less than six months nor more than one year.—_Vide\r\n  Acts of Louisiana, 1 Session, 9th Legislature_, 1828–9, No. 24,\r\n  Section 16. (_Rev. Stat._ 1852, p. 550, § 143.)\r\n\r\nWhat a charming freshness of nature is suggested by this assertion! A\r\nthing could not have happened in a certain state, because there is a law\r\nagainst it!\r\n\r\nHas there not been for two years a law forbidding to succor fugitives,\r\nor to hinder their arrest?—and has not this thing been done thousands of\r\ntimes in all the Northern States, and is not it more and more likely to\r\nbe done every year? What is a law, against the whole public sentiment of\r\nsociety?—and will anybody venture to say that the public sentiment of\r\nLouisiana _practically_ goes against separation of families?\r\n\r\nBut let us examine a case more minutely, remembering the bearing on it\r\nof two great foundation principles of slave jurisprudence: namely, that\r\na slave cannot bring a suit in any case, except in a suit for personal\r\nfreedom, and this in some states must be brought by a guardian; and that\r\na slave cannot bear testimony in any case in which whites are\r\nimplicated.\r\n\r\nSuppose Butler wants to sell Cassy’s child of nine years. There is a\r\nstatute forbidding to sell under ten years;—what is Cassy to do? She\r\ncannot bring suit. Will the state prosecute? Suppose it does,—what then?\r\nButler says the child is ten years old; if he pleases, he will say she\r\nis ten and a half, or eleven. What is Cassy to do? She cannot testify;\r\nbesides, she is utterly in Butler’s power. He may tell her that if she\r\noffers to stir in the affair, he will whip the child within an inch of\r\nits life; and she knows he can do it, and that there is no help for\r\nit;—he may lock her up in a dungeon, sell her on to a distant\r\nplantation, or do any other despotic thing he chooses, and there is\r\nnobody to say Nay.\r\n\r\nHow much does the protective statute amount to for Cassy? It may be very\r\nwell as a piece of advice to the public, or as a decorous expression of\r\nopinion; but one might as well try to stop the current of the\r\nMississippi with a bulrush as the tide of trade in human beings with\r\nsuch a regulation.\r\n\r\nWe think that, by this time, the reader will agree with us, that the\r\nless the defenders of slavery say about protective statutes, the better.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  Slavery as It Is; Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses. New York, 1839,\r\n  pp. 52, 53.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                       THE EXECUTION OF JUSTICE.\r\n\r\n State _v._ Eliza Rowand.—The “Ægis of Protection” to the Slave’s Life.\r\n\r\n  “We cannot but regard the fact of this trial as a salutary\r\n    occurrence.”—_Charleston Courier._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving given some account of what sort of statutes are to be found on\r\nthe law-books of slavery, the reader will hardly be satisfied without\r\nknowing what sort of trials are held under them. We will quote one\r\nspecimen of a trial, reported in the _Charleston Courier_ of May 6th,\r\n1847. The _Charleston Courier_ is one of the leading papers of South\r\nCarolina, and the case is reported with the utmost apparent innocence\r\nthat there was anything about the trial that could reflect in the least\r\non the character of the state for the utmost legal impartiality. In\r\nfact, the _Charleston Courier_ ushers it into public view with the\r\nfollowing flourish of trumpets, as something which is forever to\r\nconfound those who say that South Carolina does not protect the life of\r\nthe slave:\r\n\r\n                         THE TRIAL FOR MURDER.\r\n\r\n  Our community was deeply interested and excited, yesterday, by a\r\n  case of great importance, and also of entire novelty in our\r\n  jurisprudence. It was the trial of a lady of respectable family, and\r\n  the mother of a large family, charged with the murder of her own or\r\n  her husband’s slave. The court-house was thronged with spectators of\r\n  the exciting drama, who remained, with unabated interest and\r\n  undiminished numbers, until the verdict was rendered acquitting the\r\n  prisoner. We cannot but regard the fact of this trial as a salutary,\r\n  although in itself lamentable occurrence, as it will show to the\r\n  world that, however panoplied in station and wealth, and although\r\n  challenging those sympathies which are the right and inheritance of\r\n  the female sex, no one will be suffered, in this community, to\r\n  escape the most sifting scrutiny, at the risk of even an ignominious\r\n  death, who stands charged with the suspicion of murdering a\r\n  slave,—to whose life our law now extends the ægis of protection, in\r\n  the same manner as it does to that of the white man, _save only in\r\n  the character of the evidence necessary for conviction or defence_.\r\n  While evil-disposed persons at home are thus taught that they may\r\n  expect rigorous trial and condign punishment, when, actuated by\r\n  malignant passions, they invade the life of the humble slave, the\r\n  enemies of our domestic institution abroad will find, their\r\n  calumnies to the contrary notwithstanding, that we are resolved, in\r\n  this particular, to do the full measure of our duty to the laws of\r\n  humanity. We subjoin a report of the case.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the trial are thus given:\r\n\r\n                    TRIAL FOR THE MURDER OF A SLAVE.\r\n\r\n         _State_ v. _Eliza Rowand_.—_Spring Term, May 5, 1847._\r\n\r\n                 Tried before his Honor Judge O’Neall.\r\n\r\n  The prisoner was brought to the bar and arraigned, attended by her\r\n  husband and mother, and humanely supported, during the trying scene,\r\n  by the sheriff, J.

And as the jurors aforesaid, upon their oaths aforesaid, do\r\n  say, that the said Eliza Rowand her the said slave named Maria, in\r\n  the manner and by the means, aforesaid, feloniously, maliciously,\r\n  wilfully, deliberately, and of her malice aforethought, did kill and\r\n  murder, against the form of the act of the General Assembly of the\r\n  said state in such case made and provided, and against the peace and\r\n  dignity of the same state aforesaid.\r\n\r\n  And the jurors aforesaid, upon their oaths aforesaid, do further\r\n  present, that the said Eliza Rowand, not having the fear of God\r\n  before her eyes, but being moved and seduced by the instigation of\r\n  the devil, on the sixth day of January, in the year of our Lord one\r\n  thousand eight hundred and forty-seven, with force and arms, at\r\n  Charleston, in the district of Charleston, and state aforesaid, in\r\n  and upon a certain other female slave of Robert Rowand, named Maria,\r\n  in the peace of God, and of the said state, then and there being,\r\n  feloniously, maliciously, wilfully, deliberately, and of her malice\r\n  aforethought, did make an assault; and that the said Eliza Rowand,\r\n  with a certain piece of wood, which she, the said Eliza Rowand, in\r\n  both her hands then and there had and held, her the said\r\n  last-mentioned slave named Maria did then and there strike, and\r\n  beat, in and upon the head of her the said Maria, then and there\r\n  giving to her the said Maria, by such striking and beating\r\n  aforesaid, with the piece of wood aforesaid, divers mortal bruises,\r\n  on the top, back, and side of the head, of her the said Maria, of\r\n  which said several mortal bruises she the said Maria then and there\r\n  instantly died. And so the jurors aforesaid, upon their oaths\r\n  aforesaid, do say, that the said Eliza Rowand her the said\r\n  last-mentioned slave named Maria, in the manner and by the means\r\n  last mentioned, feloniously, maliciously, wilfully, deliberately,\r\n  and of her malice aforethought, did kill and murder, against the\r\n  form of the act of the General Assembly of the said state in such\r\n  case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the\r\n  same state aforesaid.\r\n\r\n                                        H. BAILEY, _Attorney-general_.\r\n\r\nAs some of our readers may not have been in the habit of endeavoring to\r\nextract anything like common sense or information from documents so very\r\nconcisely and luminously worded, the author will just state her own\r\nopinion that the above document is intended to charge Mrs. Eliza Rowand\r\nwith having killed her slave Maria, in one of two ways: either with\r\nbeating her on the head with her own hands, or having the same deed\r\nperformed by proxy, by her slave-man Richard. The whole case is now\r\npresented. In order to make the reader clearly understand the arguments,\r\nit is necessary that he bear in mind that the law of 1740, as we have\r\nbefore shown, punished the murder of the slave only with fine and\r\ndisfranchisement, while the law of 1821 punishes it with death.\r\n\r\n  On motion of Mr. Petigru, the prisoner was allowed to remove from\r\n  the bar, and take her place by her counsel; the judge saying he\r\n  granted the motion only because the prisoner was a woman, but that\r\n  no such privilege would have been extended by him to any man.\r\n\r\n  The Attorney-general, Henry Bailey, Esq., then rose and opened the\r\n  case for the state, in substance, as follows: He said that, after\r\n  months of anxiety and expectation, the curtain had at length risen,\r\n  and he and the jury were about to bear their part in the sad drama\r\n  of real life, which had so long engrossed the public mind. He and\r\n  they were called to the discharge of an important, painful, and\r\n  solemn duty. They were to pass between the prisoner and the state—to\r\n  take an inquisition of blood; on their decision hung the life or\r\n  death, the honor or ignominy, of the prisoner; yet he trusted he and\r\n  they would have strength and ability to perform their duty\r\n  faithfully; and, whatever might be the result, their consciences\r\n  would be consoled and quieted by that reflection. He bade the jury\r\n  pause and reflect on the great sanctions and solemn responsibilities\r\n  under which they were acting. The constitution of the state invested\r\n  them with power over all that affected the life and was dear to the\r\n  family of the unfortunate lady on trial before them. They were\r\n  charged, too, with the sacred care of the law of the land; and to\r\n  their solution was submitted one of the most solemn questions ever\r\n  intrusted to the arbitrament of man. They should pursue a direct and\r\n  straight-forward course, turning neither to the right hand nor to\r\n  the left—influenced neither by prejudice against the prisoner, nor\r\n  by a morbid sensibility in her behalf. Some of them might\r\n  practically and personally be strangers to their present duty; but\r\n  they were all familiar with the laws, and must be aware of the\r\n  responsibilities of jurymen. It was scarcely necessary to tell them\r\n  that, if evidence fixed guilt on this prisoner, they should not\r\n  hesitate to record a verdict of guilty, although they should write\r\n  that verdict in tears of blood. They should let no sickly\r\n  sentimentality, or morbid feeling on the subject of capital\r\n  punishments, deter them from the discharge of their plain and\r\n  obvious duty. They were to administer, not to make, the law; they\r\n  were called on to enforce the law, by sanctioning the highest duty\r\n  to God and to their country. If any of them were disturbed with\r\n  doubts or scruples on this point, he scarcely supposed they would\r\n  have gone into the jury-box. The law had awarded capital punishment\r\n  as the meet retribution for the crime under investigation, and they\r\n  were sworn to administer that law. It had, too, the full sanction of\r\n  Holy Writ; we were there told that “the land cannot be cleansed of\r\n  the blood shed therein, except by the blood of him that shed it.” He\r\n  felt assured, then, that they would be swayed only by a firm resolve\r\n  to act on this occasion in obedience to the dictates of sound\r\n  judgments and enlightened consciences. The prisoner, however, had\r\n  claims on them, as well as the community; she was entitled to a fair\r\n  and impartial trial. By the wise and humane principles of our law,\r\n  they were bound to hold the prisoner _innocent_, and she stood\r\n  _guiltless_ before them, until proved guilty, by legal, competent,\r\n  and satisfactory evidence. Deaf alike to the voice of sickly\r\n  humanity and heated prejudice, they should proceed to their task\r\n  with minds perfectly equipoised and impartial; they should weigh the\r\n  circumstances of the case with a nice and careful hand; and if, by\r\n  legal evidence, circumstantial and satisfactory, although not\r\n  positive, guilt be established, they should unhesitatingly,\r\n  fearlessly and faithfully, record the result of their convictions.\r\n  He would next call their attention to certain legal distinctions,\r\n  but would not say a word of the facts; he would leave _them_ to the\r\n  lips of the witnesses, unaffected by any previous comments of his\r\n  own. The prisoner stood indicted for the murder of a slave. This was\r\n  supposed not to be murder at common law. At least, it was not murder\r\n  by our former statute; but the act of 1821 had placed the killing of\r\n  the white man and the black man on the same footing. He here read\r\n  the act of 1821, declaring that “any person who shall wilfully,\r\n  deliberately, and maliciously murder a slave, shall, on conviction\r\n  thereof, suffer death without benefit of clergy.” The rules\r\n  applicable to murder at common law were generally applicable,\r\n  however, to the present case. The inquiries to be made may be\r\n  reduced to two: 1. Is the party charged guilty of the fact of\r\n  killing? This must be clearly made out by proof. If she be not\r\n  guilty of killing, there is an end of the case. 2. The character of\r\n  that killing, or of the offence. Was it done with malice\r\n  aforethought? Malice is the essential ingredient of the crime. Where\r\n  killing takes place, malice is presumed, unless the contrary appear;\r\n  and this must be gathered from the attending circumstances. Malice\r\n  is a technical term, importing a different meaning from that\r\n  conveyed by the same word in common parlance. According to the\r\n  learned Michael Foster, it consists not in “malevolence to\r\n  particulars,” it does not mean hatred to any particular individual,\r\n  but is general in its import and application. But even killing, with\r\n  intention to kill, is not always murder; there may be justifiable\r\n  and excusable homicide, and killing in sudden heat and passion is so\r\n  modified to manslaughter. Yet there may be murder when there is no\r\n  ill-feeling,—nay, perfect indifference to the slain,—as in the case\r\n  of the robber who slays to conceal his crime. Malice aforethought is\r\n  that depraved feeling of the heart, which makes one regardless of\r\n  social duty, and fatally bent on mischief. It is fulfilled by that\r\n  recklessness of law and human life which is indicated by shooting\r\n  into a crowd, and thus doing murder on even an unknown object. Such\r\n  a feeling the law regards as hateful, and visits, in its practical\r\n  exhibition, with condign punishment, because opposed to the very\r\n  existence of law and society. One may do fatal mischief without this\r\n  recklessness; but when the act is done, regardless of consequences,\r\n  and death ensues, it is murder in the eye of the law. If the facts\r\n  to be proved in this case should not come up to these requisitions,\r\n  he implored the jury to acquit the accused, as at once due to law\r\n  and justice. They should note every fact with scrutinizing eye, and\r\n  ascertain whether the fatal result proceeded from passing accident\r\n  or from brooding revenge, which the law stamped with the odious name\r\n  of malice. He would make no further preliminary remarks, but proceed\r\n  at once to lay the facts before them, from the mouths of the\r\n  witnesses.\r\n\r\n                              _Evidence._\r\n\r\n  _J. Porteous Deveaux_ sworn.—He is the coroner of Charleston\r\n  district; held the inquest, on the seventh of January last, on the\r\n  body of the deceased slave, _Maria_, the slave of Robert Rowand, at\r\n  the residence of Mrs. T. C. Bee (the mother of the prisoner), in\r\n  Logan-street. The body was found in an outbuilding—a kitchen; it was\r\n  the body of an old and emaciated person, between fifty and sixty\r\n  years of age; it was not examined in his presence by physicians; saw\r\n  some few scratches about the face; adjourned to the City Hall. Mrs.\r\n  Rowand was examined; her examination was in writing; it was here\r\n  produced, and read, as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Mrs. _Eliza Rowand_ sworn.—Says _Maria_ is her nurse, and had\r\n  misbehaved on yesterday morning; deponent sent Maria to Mr. Rowand’s\r\n  house, to be corrected by Simon; deponent sent Maria from the house\r\n  about seven o’clock, A. M.; she returned to her about nine o’clock;\r\n  came into her chamber; Simon did not come into the chamber at any\r\n  time previous to the death of Maria; deponent says Maria fell down\r\n  in the chamber; deponent had her seated up by Richard, who was then\r\n  in the chamber, and deponent gave Maria some asafœtida; deponent\r\n  then left the room; Richard came down and said Maria was dead;\r\n  deponent says Richard did not strike Maria, nor did any one else\r\n  strike her, in deponent’s chamber. Richard left the chamber\r\n  immediately with deponent; Maria was about fifty-two years of age;\r\n  deponent sent Maria by Richard to Simon, to Mr Rowand’s house, to be\r\n  corrected; Mr. Rowand was absent from the city; Maria died about\r\n  twelve o’clock; Richard and Maria were on good terms; deponent was\r\n  in the chamber all the while that Richard and Maria were there\r\n  together.\r\n\r\n                                                        “ELIZA ROWAND.\r\n\r\n  “Sworn to before me this seventh January, 1847.\r\n\r\n                                     “J. P. DEVEAUX, _Coroner, D. C._”\r\n\r\n  Witness went to the chamber of prisoner, where the death occurred;\r\n  saw nothing particular; some pieces of wood in a box, set in the\r\n  chimney; his attention was called to one piece, in particular,\r\n  eighteen inches long, three indies wide, and about one and a half\r\n  inch thick; did not measure it; the jury of inquest did; it was not\r\n  a light-wood knot; thinks it was of oak; there was some pine wood\r\n  and some split oak. Dr. Peter Porcher was called to examine the body\r\n  professionally, who did so out of witness’ presence.\r\n\r\n  Before this witness left the stand, B. F. Hunt, Esq., one of the\r\n  counsel for the prisoner, rose and opened the defence before the\r\n  jury, in substance as follows:\r\n\r\n  He said that the scene before them was a very novel one; and whether\r\n  for good or evil, he would not pretend to prophesy. It was the first\r\n  time, in the history of this state, that a lady of good character\r\n  and respectable connections stood arraigned at the bar, and had been\r\n  put on trial for her life, on facts arising out of her domestic\r\n  relations to her own slave. It was a spectacle consoling, and\r\n  cheering, perhaps, to those who owed no good will to the\r\n  institutions of our country; but calculated only to excite pain and\r\n  regret among ourselves. He would not state a proposition so\r\n  revolting to humanity as that crime should go unpunished; but\r\n  judicial interference between the slave and the owner was a matter\r\n  at once of delicacy and danger. It was the first time he had ever\r\n  stood between a slave-owner and the public prosecutor, and his\r\n  sensations were anything but pleasant. _This is an entirely\r\n  different case from homicide between equals in society._\r\n  Subordination is indispensable where slavery exists; and in this\r\n  there is no new principle involved. The same principle prevails in\r\n  every country; on shipboard and in the army a large discretion is\r\n  always left to the superior. Charges by inferiors against their\r\n  superiors were always to be viewed with great circumspection at\r\n  least, and especially when the latter are charged with cruelty or\r\n  crime against subordinates. In the relation of owner and slave there\r\n  is an absence of the usual motives for murder, and strong\r\n  inducements against it on the part of the former. Life is usually\r\n  taken from avarice or passion. The master gains nothing, but loses\r\n  much, by the death of his slave; and when he takes the life of the\r\n  latter deliberately, there must be more than ordinary malice to\r\n  instigate the deed. The policy of altering the old law of 1740,\r\n  which punished the killing of a slave with fine and political\r\n  disfranchisement, was more than doubtful. It was the law of our\r\n  colonial ancestors; it conformed to their policy and was approved by\r\n  their wisdom, and it continued undisturbed by their posterity until\r\n  the year 1821. It was engrafted on our policy in counteraction of\r\n  the schemes and machinations, or in deference to the clamors, of\r\n  those who formed plans for our improvement, although not interested\r\n  in nor understanding our institutions, and whose interference led to\r\n  the tragedy of 1822. He here adverted to the views of Chancellor\r\n  Harper on this subject, who, in his able and philosophical memoir on\r\n  slavery, said: “It is a somewhat singular fact, that when there\r\n  existed in our state no law for punishing the murder of a slave,\r\n  other than a pecuniary fine, there were, I will venture to say, at\r\n  least ten murders of freemen for one murder of a slave. Yet it is\r\n  supposed that they are less protected than their masters.” “The\r\n  change was made in subserviency to the opinions and clamor of\r\n  others, who were utterly incompetent to form an opinion on the\r\n  subject; and a wise act is seldom the result of legislation in this\r\n  spirit. From the fact I have stated, it is plain they need less\r\n  protection. Juries are, therefore, less willing to convict, and it\r\n  may sometimes happen that the guilty will escape all punishment.\r\n  _Security_ is one of the compensations of their humble position. We\r\n  challenge the comparison, that with us there have been fewer murders\r\n  of slaves than of parents, children, apprentices, and other murders,\r\n  cruel and unnatural, in society where slavery does not exist.”\r\n\r\n  Such was the opinion of Chancellor Harper on this subject, who had\r\n  profoundly studied it, and whose views had been extensively read on\r\n  this continent and in Europe. Fortunately, the jury, he said, were\r\n  of the country, acquainted with our policy and practice; composed of\r\n  men too independent and honorable to be led astray by the noise and\r\n  clamor out of doors. All was now as it should be;—at least, a court\r\n  of justice had assembled, to which his client had fled for refuge\r\n  and safety; its threshold was sacred; no profane clamors entered\r\n  there; but legal investigation was had of facts, derived from the\r\n  testimony of sworn witnesses; and this should teach the community to\r\n  shut their bosoms against sickly humanity, and their ears to\r\n  imaginary tales of blood and horror, the food of a depraved\r\n  appetite. _He warned the jury that they were to listen to no\r\n  testimony but that of free white persons, given on oath in open\r\n  court._ They were to _imagine_ none that came not from them. It was\r\n  for this that they were selected,—their intelligence putting them\r\n  beyond the influence of unfounded accusations, unsustained by legal\r\n  proof; of legends of aggravated cruelty, founded on the evidence of\r\n  negroes, and arising from weak and wicked falsehoods. Were slaves\r\n  permitted to testify against their owner, it would cut the cord that\r\n  unites them in peace and harmony, and enable them to sacrifice their\r\n  masters to their ill will or revenge. Whole crews had been often\r\n  leagued to charge captains of vessels with foulest murder, but\r\n  judicial trial had exposed the falsehood. Truth has been distorted\r\n  in this case, and murder manufactured out of what was nothing more\r\n  than _ordinary domestic discipline_. Chastisement must be inflicted\r\n  until subordination is produced; and the extent of the punishment is\r\n  not to be judged of by one’s neighbors, but by himself. The event in\r\n  this case has been unfortunate and sad; but there was no motive for\r\n  the taking of life. There is no pecuniary interest in the owner to\r\n  destroy his slave; the murder of his slave can only happen from\r\n  ferocious passions of the master, filling his own bosom with anguish\r\n  and contrition. This case has no other basis but unfounded rumor,\r\n  commonly believed, _on evidence that will not venture here_, the\r\n  offspring of that passion and depravity which make up falsehood. The\r\n  hope of freedom, of change of owners, revenge, are all motives with\r\n  slave witnesses to malign their owners; and to credit such testimony\r\n  would be to dissolve human society. Where deliberate, wilful, and\r\n  malicious murder is done, whether by male or female, the retribution\r\n  of the law is a debt to God and man; but the jury should beware lest\r\n  it fall upon the innocent. The offence charged was not strictly\r\n  murder at common law. The act of 1740 was founded on the practical\r\n  good sense of our old planters, and its spirit still prevails. The\r\n  act of 1821 is, by its terms, an act only to increase the punishment\r\n  of persons convicted of murdering a slave,—_and this is a refinement\r\n  in humanity of doubtful policy_. But, by the act of 1821, the murder\r\n  must be wilful, deliberate and malicious; and, when punishment is\r\n  due to the slave, the master must not be held to strict account for\r\n  going _an inch beyond the mark_; whether for doing so he shall be a\r\n  felon, is a question for the jury to solve. The master must conquer\r\n  a refractory slave; and deliberation, so as to render clear the\r\n  existence of malice, is necessary to bring the master within the\r\n  provision of the act. He bade the jury remember the words of Him who\r\n  spake as never man spake,—“_Let him that has never sinned throw the\r\n  first stone_.” _They, as masters, might regret excesses to which\r\n  they have themselves carried punishment._ He was not at all\r\n  surprised at the course of the attorney-general; it was his wont to\r\n  treat every case with perfect fairness. He (Colonel H.) agreed that\r\n  the inquiry should be—\r\n\r\n  1. Into the fact of the death.\r\n\r\n  2. The character or motive of the act.\r\n\r\n  The examination of the prisoner showed conclusively that the slave\r\n  died a natural death, and not from personal violence. She was\r\n  chastised with a lawful weapon,—was in weak health, nervous, made\r\n  angry by her punishment,—excited. The story was then a plain one;\r\n  the community had been misled by the creations of imagination, or\r\n  the statements of interested slaves. The negro came into her\r\n  mistress’ chamber; fell on the floor; medicine was given her; it was\r\n  supposed she was asleep, but she slept the sleep of death. To show\r\n  the wisdom and policy of the old act of 1740 (this indictment is\r\n  under both acts,—the punishment only altered by that of 1821), he\r\n  urged that a case like this was not murder at common law; nor is the\r\n  same evidence applicable at common law. There, murder was presumed\r\n  from killing; not so in the case of a slave. The act of 1740 permits\r\n  a master, when his slave is killed in his presence, there being no\r\n  other white person present, to exculpate himself by his own oath;\r\n  and this exculpation is complete, unless clearly contravened by the\r\n  evidence of two white witnesses. This is exactly what the prisoner\r\n  has done; she has, as the law permits, by calling on God, exculpated\r\n  herself. And her oath is good, at least against the slander of her\r\n  own slaves. Which, then, should prevail, the clamors of others, or\r\n  the policy of the law established by our colonial ancestors? There\r\n  would not be a tittle of positive evidence against the prisoner,\r\n  nothing but circumstantial evidence; and ingenious combination might\r\n  be made to lead to any conclusion. Justice was all that his client\r\n  asked. She appealed to liberal and high-minded men,—and she rejoiced\r\n  in the privilege of doing so,—to accord her that justice they would\r\n  demand for themselves.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Deveaux was not cross-examined.\r\n\r\n                          _Evidence resumed._\r\n\r\n  _Dr. E. W. North_ sworn.—(Cautioned by attorney-general to avoid\r\n  hearsay evidence.) Was the family physician of Mrs. Rowand. Went on\r\n  the 6th January, at Mrs. Rowand’s request, to see her at her\r\n  mother’s, in Logan-street; found her down stairs, in sitting-room.\r\n  She was in a nervous and excited state; had been so for a month\r\n  before; he had attended her; she said nothing to witness of slave\r\n  Maria; found Maria in a chamber, up stairs, about one o’clock, P.\r\n  M.; she was dead; she appeared to have been dead about an hour and a\r\n  half; his attention was attracted to a piece of pine wood on a trunk\r\n  or table in the room; it had a large knot on one end; had it been\r\n  used on Maria, it must have caused considerable contusion; other\r\n  pieces of wood were in a box, and much smaller ones; the corpse was\r\n  lying one side in the chamber; it was not laid out; presumed she\r\n  died there; the marks on the body were, to witness’ view, very\r\n  slight; some scratches about the face; he purposely avoided making\r\n  an examination; observed no injuries about the head; had no\r\n  conversation with Mrs. Rowand about Maria; left the house; it was on\r\n  the 6th January last,—the day before the inquest; knew the slave\r\n  before, but had never attended her.\r\n\r\n  _Cross-examined._—Mrs. Rowand was in feeble health, and nervous; the\r\n  slave Maria was weak and emaciated in appearance; sudden death of\r\n  such a person, in such a state, from apoplexy or action of nervous\r\n  system, not unlikely; her sudden death would not imply violence; had\r\n  prescribed asafœtida for Mrs. Rowand on a former visit; it is an\r\n  appropriate remedy for nervous disorders. Mrs. Rowand was not of\r\n  bodily strength to handle the pine knot so as to give a severe blow;\r\n  Mrs. Rowand has five or six children, the elder of them large enough\r\n  to have carried pieces of the wood about the room; there must have\r\n  been a severe contusion, and much extravasation of blood, to infer\r\n  death from violence in this case; apoplexy is frequently attended\r\n  with extravasation of blood; there were two Marias in the family.\r\n\r\n  _In reply._—Mrs. Rowand could have raised the pine knot, but could\r\n  not have struck a blow with it; such a piece of wood could have\r\n  produced death, but it would have left its mark; saw the fellow\r\n  Richard; he was quite capable of giving such a blow.\r\n\r\n  _Dr. Peter Porcher._—Was called in by the Coroner’s jury to examine\r\n  Maria’s body; found it in the wash-kitchen; it was the corpse of one\r\n  feeble and emaciated; partly prepared for burial; had the clothes\r\n  removed; the body was lacerated with stripes; abrasions about face\r\n  and knuckles; skin knocked off; passed his hand over the head; no\r\n  bone broken; on request, opened her thorax, and examined the\r\n  viscera; found them healthy; heart unusually so for one of her age;\r\n  no particular odor; some undigested food; no inflammation; removed\r\n  the scalp, and found considerable extravasation between scalp and\r\n  skull; scalp bloodshot; just under the scalp, found the effects of a\r\n  single blow, just over the right ear; after removing the scalp,\r\n  lifted the bone; no rupture of any blood-vessel; some softening of\r\n  the brain in the upper hemisphere; there was considerable\r\n  extravasation under the scalp, the result of a succession of blows\r\n  on the top of the head; this extravasation was general, but that\r\n  over the ear was a single spot; the butt-end of a cowhide would have\r\n  sufficed for this purpose; an ordinary stick, a heavy one, would\r\n  have done it; a succession of blows on the head, in a feeble woman,\r\n  would lead to death, when, in a stronger one, it would not; saw no\r\n  other appearance about her person, to account for her death, except\r\n  those blows.\r\n\r\n  _Cross-examined._—To a patient in this woman’s condition, the blows\r\n  would probably cause death; they were not such as were calculated to\r\n  kill an ordinary person; witness saw the body twenty-four hours\r\n  after her death; it was winter, and bitter cold; no disorganization,\r\n  and the examination was therefore to be relied on; the blow behind\r\n  the ear might have resulted from a fall, but not the blow on the top\r\n  of the head, unless she fell head foremost; came to the conclusion\r\n  of a succession of blows, from the extent of the extravasation; a\r\n  single blow would have shown a distinct spot, with a gradual\r\n  spreading or diffusion; one large blow could not account for it, as\r\n  the head was spherical; no blood on the brain; the softening of the\r\n  brain did not amount to much; in an ordinary dissection would have\r\n  passed it over; anger sometimes produces apoplexy, which results in\r\n  death; blood between the scalp and the bone of the skull; it was\r\n  evidently a fresh extravasation; twenty-four hours would scarcely\r\n  have made any change; knew nothing of this negro before; even after\r\n  examination, the cause of death is sometimes inscrutable,—not usual,\r\n  however.\r\n\r\n  _In reply._—Does not attribute the softening of the brain to the\r\n  blows; it was slight, and might have been the result of age; it was\r\n  some evidence of impairment of vital powers by advancing age.\r\n\r\n  _Dr. A. P. Hayne._—At request of the coroner, acted with Dr.\r\n  Porcher; was shown into an outhouse; saw on the back of the corpse\r\n  evidences of contusion; arms swollen and enlarged; laceration of\r\n  body; contusions on head and neck; between scalp and skull\r\n  extravasation of blood, on the top of head, and behind the right\r\n  ear; a burn on the hand; the brain presented healthy appearance;\r\n  opened the body, and no evidences of disease in the chest or\r\n  viscera; attributed the extravasation of blood to external injury\r\n  from blows,—blows from a large and broad and blunt instrument;\r\n  attributes the death to those blows; supposes they were adequate to\r\n  cause death, as she was old, weak and emaciated.\r\n\r\n  _Cross-examined._—Would not have caused death in a young and robust\r\n  person.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The evidence for the prosecution here closed, and no witnesses were\r\n  called for the defence.\r\n\r\n  The jury were then successively addressed, ably and eloquently, by\r\n  J. L. Petigru and James S. Rhett, Esqrs., on behalf of the prisoner,\r\n  and H. Bailey, Esq., on behalf of the state, and by B. F. Hunt,\r\n  Esq., in reply. Of those speeches, and also of the judge’s charge,\r\n  we have taken full notes, but have neither time nor space to insert\r\n  them here.\r\n\r\n  His Honor, Judge O’Neall, then charged the jury eloquently and ably\r\n  on the facts, vindicating the existing law, making death the penalty\r\n  for the murder of a slave; but, on the law, intimated to the jury\r\n  that he held the act of 1740 so far still in force as to admit of\r\n  the prisoner’s exculpation by her own oath, unless clearly disproved\r\n  by the oaths of two witnesses; and that they were, therefore, in his\r\n  opinion, bound to acquit,—although he left it to them, wholly, to\r\n  say whether the prisoner was guilty of murder, killing in sudden\r\n  heat and passion, or not guilty.\r\n\r\n  The jury then retired, and, in about twenty or thirty minutes,\r\n  returned with a verdict of “Not Guilty.”\r\n\r\nThere are some points which appear in this statement of the trial,\r\nespecially in the plea for the defence. Particular attention is called\r\nto the following passage:\r\n\r\n  “Fortunately,” said the lawyer, “the jury were of the\r\n  country;—acquainted with our policy and practice; composed of men\r\n  too honorable to be led astray by the _noise and clamor out of\r\n  doors_. All was now as it should be; at least, a court of justice\r\n  had assembled to which his client had fled for refuge and safety;\r\n  its threshold was sacred; _no profane clamors entered there_; but\r\n  legal investigation was had of facts.”\r\n\r\nFrom this it plainly appears that the case was a notorious one; so\r\nnotorious and atrocious as to break through all the apathy which\r\nslave-holding institutions tend to produce, and to surround the\r\ncourt-house with noise and clamor.\r\n\r\nFrom another intimation in the same speech, it would appear that there\r\nwas abundant testimony of slaves to the direct fact,—testimony which\r\nleft no kind of doubt on the popular mind. Why else does he thus\r\nearnestly warn the jury?\r\n\r\n  He warned the jury that they were to listen to no evidence but that\r\n  of free white persons, given on oath in open court; they were to\r\n  imagine none that came not from them. It was for this that they were\r\n  selected;—their intelligence putting them beyond the influence of\r\n  unfounded accusations, unsustained by legal proof; of legends of\r\n  aggravated cruelty, founded on the evidence of negroes, and arising\r\n  from weak and wicked falsehoods.\r\n\r\nSee also this remarkable admission:—“Truth had been distorted in this\r\ncase, and murder manufactured out of what was nothing more than ORDINARY\r\nDOMESTIC DISCIPLINE.” If the reader refers to the testimony, he will\r\nfind it testified that the woman appeared to be about sixty years old;\r\nthat she was much emaciated; that there had been a succession of blows\r\non the top of her head, and one violent one over the ear; and that, in\r\nthe opinion of a surgeon, these blows were sufficient to cause death.\r\nYet the lawyer for the defence coolly remarks that “murder had been\r\n_manufactured_ out of what was _ordinary domestic discipline_.” Are we\r\nto understand that beating feeble old women on the head, in this manner,\r\nis a specimen of _ordinary domestic discipline_ in Charleston? What\r\nwould have been said if any anti-slavery newspaper at the North had made\r\nsuch an assertion as this? Yet the _Charleston Courier_ reports this\r\nstatement without comment or denial. But let us hear the lady’s lawyer\r\ngo still further in vindication of this ordinary domestic discipline:\r\n“Chastisement must be inflicted until subordination is produced; and the\r\nextent of the punishment is not to be judged by one’s neighbors, but by\r\nhimself. The event, IN THIS CASE, has been unfortunate and sad.” The\r\nlawyer admits that the result of thumping a feeble old woman on the head\r\nhas, _in this case_, been “unfortunate and sad.” The old thing had not\r\nstrength to bear it, and had no greater regard for the convenience of\r\nthe family, and the reputation of “the institution,” than to die, and so\r\nget the family and the community generally into trouble. It will appear\r\nfrom this that in most cases where old women are thumped on the head\r\nthey have stronger constitutions—or more consideration.\r\n\r\nAgain he says, “When punishment is due to the slave, the master must not\r\nbe held to strict account _for going an inch beyond the mark_.” And\r\nfinally, and most astounding of all, comes this: “_He bade the jury\r\nremember the words of him who spake as never man spake_,—‘LET HIM THAT\r\nHATH NEVER SINNED THROW THE FIRST STONE.’ They, as masters, might regret\r\nexcesses to which they themselves might have carried punishment.”\r\n\r\nWhat sort of an insinuation is this? Did he mean to say that almost all\r\nthe jurymen had probably done things of the same sort, and therefore\r\ncould have nothing to say in this case? and did no member of the jury\r\nget up and resent such a charge? From all that appears, the jury\r\nacquiesced in it as quite a matter of course; and the _Charleston\r\nCourier_ quotes it without comment, in the record of a trial which it\r\nsays “will show to the world HOW the law extends the ægis of her\r\nprotection alike over the white man and the humblest slave.”\r\n\r\nLastly, notice the decision of the judge, which has become law in South\r\nCarolina. What point does it establish? That the simple oath of the\r\nmaster, in face of all circumstantial evidence to the contrary, may\r\nclear him, when the murder of a slave is the question. And this trial is\r\nparaded as a triumphant specimen of legal impartiality and equity! “If\r\nthe _light_ that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                          THE GOOD OLD TIMES.\r\n\r\n            “A refinement in humanity of doubtful policy.”\r\n\r\n                                                B. F. HUNT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author takes no pleasure in presenting to her readers the shocking\r\ndetails of the following case. But it seems necessary to exhibit what\r\nwere the actual workings of the ancient law of South Carolina, which has\r\nbeen characterized as one “conformed to the policy, and approved by the\r\nwisdom,” of the fathers of that state, and the reform of which has been\r\ncalled “a refinement in humanity of doubtful policy.”\r\n\r\nIt is well, also, to add the charge of Judge Wilds, partly for its\r\nintrinsic literary merit, and the nobleness of its sentiments, but\r\nprincipally because it exhibits such a contrast as could scarcely be\r\nfound elsewhere, between the judge’s high and indignant sense of\r\njustice, and the shameful impotence and imbecility of the laws under\r\nwhich he acted.\r\n\r\nThe case was brought to the author’s knowledge by a letter from a\r\ngentleman of Pennsylvania, from which the following is an extract:\r\n\r\n  Some time between the years 1807 and 1810, there was lying in the\r\n  harbor of Charleston a ship commanded by a man named Slater. His\r\n  crew were slaves: one of them committed some offence, not specified\r\n  in the narrative. The captain ordered him to be bound and laid upon\r\n  the deck; and there, in the harbor of Charleston, in the broad\r\n  daylight, compelled another slave-sailor to chop off his head. The\r\n  affair was public—notorious. A prosecution was commenced against\r\n  him; the offence was proved beyond all doubt,—perhaps, indeed, it\r\n  was not denied,—and the judge, in a most eloquent charge or rebuke\r\n  of the defendant, expressed his sincere regret that he could inflict\r\n  no punishment, under the laws of the state.\r\n\r\n  I was studying law when the case was published in “Hall’s American\r\n  Law Journal, vol. I.” I have not seen the book for twenty-five or\r\n  thirty years. I may be in error as to names, &c., but while I have\r\n  life and my senses the facts of the case cannot be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe following is the “charge” alluded to in the above letter. It was\r\npronounced by the Honorable Judge Wilds, of South Carolina, and is\r\ncopied from Hall’s Law Journal, I. 67.\r\n\r\n  John Slater! You have been convicted by a jury of your country of\r\n  the wilful murder of your own slave; and I am sorry to say, the\r\n  short, impressive, uncontradicted testimony, on which that\r\n  conviction was founded, leaves but too little room to doubt its\r\n  propriety.\r\n\r\n  The annals of human depravity might be safely challenged for a\r\n  parallel to this unfeeling, bloody and diabolical transaction.\r\n\r\n  You caused your unoffending, unresisting slave to be bound hand and\r\n  foot, and, by a refinement in cruelty, compelled his companion,\r\n  perhaps the friend of his heart, to chop his head with an axe, and\r\n  to cast his body, yet convulsing with the agonies of death, into the\r\n  water! And this deed you dared to perpetrate in the very harbor of\r\n  Charleston, within a few yards of the shore, unblushingly, in the\r\n  face of open day. Had your murderous arm been raised against your\r\n  equals, whom the laws of self-defence and the more efficacious law\r\n  of the land unite to protect, your crimes would not have been\r\n  without precedent, and would have seemed less horrid. Your personal\r\n  risk would at least have proved, that though a murderer, you were\r\n  not a coward. But you too well knew that this unfortunate man, whom\r\n  chance had subjected to your caprice, had not, like yourself,\r\n  chartered to him by the laws of the land the sacred rights of\r\n  nature; and that a stern, but necessary policy, had disarmed him of\r\n  the rights of self-defence. Too well you knew that to you alone he\r\n  could look for protection; and that your arm alone could shield him\r\n  from oppression, or avenge his wrongs; yet, that arm you cruelly\r\n  stretched out for his destruction.\r\n\r\n  The counsel, who generously volunteered his services in your behalf,\r\n  shocked at the enormity of your offence, endeavored to find a\r\n  refuge, as well for his own feelings as for those of all who heard\r\n  your trial, in a derangement of your intellect. Several witnesses\r\n  were examined to establish this fact; but the result of their\r\n  testimony, it is apprehended, was as little satisfactory to his\r\n  mind, as to those of the jury to whom it was addressed. I sincerely\r\n  wish this defence had proved successful, not from any desire to save\r\n  you from the punishment which awaits you, and which you so richly\r\n  merit, but from the desire of saving my country from the foul\r\n  reproach of having in its bosom so great a monster.\r\n\r\n  From the peculiar situation of this country, our fathers felt\r\n  themselves justified in subjecting to a very slight punishment him\r\n  who murders a slave. Whether the present state of society require a\r\n  continuation of this policy, so opposite to the apparent rights of\r\n  humanity, it remains for a subsequent legislature to decide. Their\r\n  attention would ere this have been directed to this subject, but,\r\n  for the honor of human nature, such hardened sinners as yourself are\r\n  rarely found, to disturb the repose of society. The grand jury of\r\n  this district, deeply impressed with your daring outrage against the\r\n  laws both of God and man, have made a very strong expression of\r\n  their feelings on the subject to the legislature; and, from the\r\n  wisdom and justice of that body, the friends of humanity may\r\n  confidently hope soon to see this blackest in the catalogue of human\r\n  crimes pursued by appropriate punishment.\r\n\r\n  In proceeding to pass the sentence which the law provides for your\r\n  offence, I confess I never felt more forcibly the want of power to\r\n  make respected the laws of my country, whose minister I am. You have\r\n  already violated the majesty of those laws. You have profanely\r\n  pleaded the law under which you stand convicted, as a justification\r\n  of your crime. You have held that law in one hand, and brandished\r\n  your bloody axe in the other, impiously contending that the _one_\r\n  gave a license to the unrestrained use of the _other_.\r\n\r\n  But, though you will go off unhurt in person, by the present\r\n  sentence, expect not to escape with impunity. Your bloody deed has\r\n  set a mark upon you, which I fear the good actions of your future\r\n  life will not efface. You will be held in abhorrence by an impartial\r\n  world, and shunned as a monster by every honest man. Your\r\n  unoffending posterity will be visited, for your iniquity, by the\r\n  stigma of deriving their origin from an unfeeling murderer. Your\r\n  days, which will be but few, will be spent in wretchedness; and, if\r\n  your conscience be not steeled against every virtuous emotion, if\r\n  you be not entirely abandoned to hardness of heart, the mangled,\r\n  mutilated corpse of your murdered slave will ever be present in your\r\n  imagination, obtrude itself into all your amusements, and haunt you\r\n  in the hours of silence and repose.\r\n\r\n  But, should you disregard the reproaches of an offended world,\r\n  should you hear with callous insensibility the gnawings of a guilty\r\n  conscience, yet remember, I charge you, remember, that an awful\r\n  period is fast approaching, and with you is close at hand, when you\r\n  must appear before a tribunal whose want of power can afford you no\r\n  prospect of impunity; when you must raise your bloody hands at the\r\n  bar of an impartial omniscient Judge! Remember, I pray you,\r\n  remember, whilst yet you have time, that God is just, and that his\r\n  vengeance will not sleep forever!\r\n\r\nThe penalty that followed this solemn denunciation was a fine of _seven\r\nhundred pounds_, current money, or, in default of payment, imprisonment\r\nfor seven years.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it seems that there have not been wanting those who consider the\r\nreform of this law “_a refinement in humanity of doubtful policy_”! To\r\nthis sentiment, so high an authority as that of Chancellor Harper is\r\nquoted, as the reader will see by referring to the speech of Mr. Hunt,\r\nin the last chapter. And, as is very common in such cases, the old law\r\nis vindicated, as being, on the whole, a surer protection to the life of\r\nthe slave than the new one. From the results of the last two trials,\r\nthere would seem to be a fair show of plausibility in the argument. For\r\nunder the old law it seems that Slater had at least to pay seven hundred\r\npounds, while under the new Eliza Rowand comes off with only the penalty\r\nof “a most sifting scrutiny.”\r\n\r\nThus, it appears, the penalty of the law goes with the murderer of the\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nHow is it executed in the cases which concern the life of the master?\r\nLook at this short notice of a recent trial of this kind, which is given\r\nin the _Alexandria_ (Va.) _Gazette_, of Oct. 23, 1852, as an extract\r\nfrom the _Charlestown_ (Va.) _Free Press_.\r\n\r\n                         TRIAL OF NEGRO HENRY.\r\n\r\n  The trial of this slave for an attack, with intent to kill, on the\r\n  person of Mr. Harrison Anderson, was commenced on Monday and\r\n  concluded on Tuesday evening. His Honor, Braxton Davenport, Esq.,\r\n  chief justice of the county, with four associate gentlemen justices,\r\n  composed the court.\r\n\r\n  The commonwealth was represented by its attorney, Charles B.\r\n  Harding, Esq., and the accused ably and eloquently defended by Wm.\r\n  C. Worthington and John A. Thompson, Esqs. The evidence of the\r\n  prisoner’s guilt was conclusive. A majority of the court thought\r\n  that he ought to suffer the extreme penalty of the law; but, as this\r\n  required a unanimous agreement, he was sentenced to receive five\r\n  hundred lashes, not more than thirty-nine at one time. The physician\r\n  of the jail was instructed to see that they should not be\r\n  administered too frequently, and only when, in his opinion, he could\r\n  bear them.\r\n\r\nIn another paper we are told that the _Free Press_ says:\r\n\r\n  A majority of the court thought that he ought to suffer the extreme\r\n  penalty of the law; but, as this required a unanimous agreement, he\r\n  was sentenced to receive five hundred lashes, not more than\r\n  thirty-nine at any one time. The physician of the jail was\r\n  instructed to see that they should not be administered too\r\n  frequently, and _only_ when, in his opinion, he could bear them.\r\n  This _may seem_ to be a harsh and inhuman punishment; but, when we\r\n  take into consideration that it is in accordance with the _law of\r\n  the land_, and the further fact that the insubordination among the\r\n  slaves of that state has become truly alarming, we cannot question\r\n  the righteousness of the judgment.\r\n\r\nWill anybody say that the master’s life is in more danger from the slave\r\nthan the slave’s from the master, that this disproportionate retribution\r\nis meted out? Those who countenance such legislation will do well to\r\nponder the solemn words of an ancient book, inspired by One who is no\r\nrespecter of persons:\r\n\r\n     “If I have refused justice to my man-servant or maid-servant,\r\n     When they had a cause with me,\r\n     What shall I do when God riseth up?\r\n     And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?\r\n     Did not he that made me in the womb make him?\r\n     Did not the same God fashion us in the womb?”\r\n\r\n                                         JOB 31:13–15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n     MODERATE CORRECTION AND ACCIDENTAL DEATH—STATE _v._ CASTLEMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author remarks that the record of the following trial was read by\r\nher a little time before writing the account of the death of Uncle Tom.\r\nThe shocking particulars haunted her mind and were in her thoughts when\r\nthe following sentence was written:\r\n\r\n  What man has nerve to do, man has not nerve to hear. What brother\r\n  man and brother Christian must suffer, cannot be told us, even in\r\n  our secret chamber, it so harrows up the soul. And yet, O my\r\n  country, these things are done under the shadow of thy laws! O\r\n  Christ, thy church sees them almost in silence!\r\n\r\nIt is given precisely as prepared by Dr. G. Bailey, the very liberal and\r\nfair-minded editor of the National Era.\r\n\r\n  _From the National Era, Washington, November 6, 1851._\r\n\r\n               HOMICIDE CASE IN CLARKE COUNTY, VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n  Some time since, the newspapers of Virginia contained an account of\r\n  a horrible tragedy, enacted in Clarke County, of that state. A slave\r\n  of Colonel James Castleman, it was stated, had been chained by the\r\n  neck, and whipped to death by his master, on the charge of stealing.\r\n  The whole neighborhood in which the transaction occurred was\r\n  incensed; the Virginia papers abounded in denunciations of the cruel\r\n  act; and the people of the North were called upon to bear witness to\r\n  the justice which would surely be meted out in a slave state to the\r\n  master of a slave. We did not publish the account. The case was\r\n  horrible; it was, we were confident, exceptional; it should not be\r\n  taken as evidence of the general treatment of slaves; we chose to\r\n  delay any notice of it till the courts should pronounce their\r\n  judgment, and we could announce at once the crime and its\r\n  punishment, so that the state might stand acquitted of the foul\r\n  deed.\r\n\r\n  Those who were so shocked at the transaction will be surprised and\r\n  mortified to hear that the actors in it have been tried and\r\n  _acquitted_; and when they read the following account of the trial\r\n  and verdict, published at the instance of the friends of the\r\n  accused, their mortification will deepen into bitter indignation:\r\n\r\n                   _From the “Spirit of Jefferson.”_\r\n\r\n  “COLONEL JAMES CASTLEMAN.—The following statement, understood to\r\n  have been drawn up by counsel, since the trial, has been placed by\r\n  the friends of this gentleman in our hands for publication:\r\n\r\n  “At the Circuit Superior Court of Clarke County, commencing on the\r\n  13th of October, Judge Samuels presiding, James Castleman and his\r\n  son Stephen D. Castleman were indicted jointly for the murder of\r\n  negro Lewis, property of the latter. By advice of their counsel, the\r\n  parties elected to be tried separately, and the attorney for the\r\n  commonwealth directed that James Castleman should be tried first.\r\n\r\n  “It was proved, on this trial, that for many months previous to the\r\n  occurrence the money-drawer of the tavern kept by Stephen D.\r\n  Castleman, and the liquors kept in large quantities in his cellar,\r\n  had been pillaged from time to time, until the thefts had attained\r\n  to a considerable amount. Suspicion had, from various causes, been\r\n  directed to Lewis, and another negro, named Reuben (a blacksmith),\r\n  the property of James Castleman; but by the aid of two of the\r\n  house-servants they had eluded the most vigilant watch.\r\n\r\n  “On the 20th of August last, in the afternoon, S. D. Castleman\r\n  accidentally discovered a clue, by means of which, and through one\r\n  of the house-servants implicated, he was enabled fully to detect the\r\n  depredators, and to ascertain the manner in which the theft had been\r\n  committed. He immediately sent for his father, living near him, and\r\n  after communicating what he had discovered, it was determined that\r\n  the offenders should be punished at once, and before they should\r\n  know of the discovery that had been made.\r\n\r\n  “Lewis was punished first; and in a manner, as was fully shown, to\r\n  preclude all risk of injury to his person, by stripes with a broad\r\n  leathern strap. He was punished severely, but to an extent by no\r\n  means disproportionate to his offence; nor was it pretended, in any\r\n  quarter, that this punishment implicated either his life or health.\r\n  He confessed the offence, and admitted that it had been effected by\r\n  false keys, furnished by the blacksmith, Reuben.\r\n\r\n  “The latter servant was punished immediately afterwards. It was\r\n  believed that he was the principal offender, and he was found to be\r\n  more obdurate and contumacious than Lewis had been in reference to\r\n  the offence. Thus it was proved, both by the prosecution and the\r\n  defence, that he was punished with greater severity than his\r\n  accomplice. It resulted in a like confession on his part, and he\r\n  produced the false key, one fashioned by himself, by which the theft\r\n  had been effected.\r\n\r\n  “It was further shown, on the trial, that Lewis was whipped in the\r\n  upper room of a warehouse, connected with Stephen Castleman’s store,\r\n  and near the public road, where he was at work at the time; that\r\n  after he had been flogged, to secure his person, whilst they went\r\n  after Reuben, he was confined by a chain around his neck, which was\r\n  attached to a joist above his head. The length of this chain, the\r\n  breadth and thickness of the joist, its height from the floor, and\r\n  the circlet of chain on the neck, were accurately measured; and it\r\n  was thus shown that the chain unoccupied by the circlet and the\r\n  joist was a foot and a half longer than the space between the\r\n  shoulders of the man and the joist above, or to that extent the\r\n  chain hung loose above him; that the circlet (which was fastened so\r\n  as to prevent its contraction) rested on the shoulders and breast,\r\n  the chain being sufficiently drawn only to prevent being slipped\r\n  over his head, and that there was no other place in the room to\r\n  which he could be fastened, except to one of the joists above. His\r\n  hands were tied in front; a white man, who had been at work with\r\n  Lewis during the day, was left with him by the Messrs. Castleman,\r\n  the better to insure his detention, whilst they were absent after\r\n  Reuben. It was proved by this man (who was a witness for the\r\n  prosecution) that Lewis asked for a box to stand on, or for\r\n  something that he could jump off from; that after the Castlemans had\r\n  left him he expressed a fear that when they came back he would be\r\n  whipped again; and said, if he had a knife, and could get one hand\r\n  loose, he would cut his throat. The witness stated that the negro\r\n  ‘stood firm on his feet,’ that he could turn freely in whatever\r\n  direction he wished, and that he made no complaint of the mode of\r\n  his confinement. This man stated that he remained with Lewis about\r\n  half an hour, and then left there to go home.\r\n\r\n  “After punishing Reuben, the Castlemans returned to the warehouse,\r\n  bringing him with them; their object being to confront the two men,\r\n  in the hope that by further examination of them jointly all their\r\n  accomplices might be detected.\r\n\r\n  “They were not absent more than half an hour. When they entered the\r\n  room above, Lewis was found hanging by the neck, his feet thrown\r\n  behind him, his knees a few inches from the floor, and his head\r\n  thrown forward—the body warm and supple (or relaxed), but life was\r\n  extinct.\r\n\r\n  “It was proved by the surgeons who made a post-mortem examination\r\n  before the coroner’s inquest that the death was caused by\r\n  strangulation by hanging; and other eminent surgeons were examined\r\n  to show, from the appearance of the brain and its blood-vessels\r\n  after death (as exhibited at the post-mortem examination), that the\r\n  subject could not have fainted before strangulation.\r\n\r\n  “After the evidence was finished on both sides, the jury from their\r\n  box, and of their own motion, without a word from counsel on either\r\n  side, informed the court that they had agreed upon their verdict.\r\n  The counsel assented to its being thus received, and a verdict of\r\n  “_not guilty_” was immediately rendered. The attorney for the\r\n  commonwealth then informed the court that all the evidence for the\r\n  prosecution had been laid before the jury; and as no new evidence\r\n  could be offered on the trial of Stephen D. Castleman, he submitted\r\n  to the court the propriety of entering a _nolle prosequi_. The judge\r\n  replied that the case had been fully and fairly laid before the jury\r\n  upon the evidence; that the court was not only satisfied with the\r\n  verdict, but, if any other had been rendered, it must have been set\r\n  aside; and that if no further evidence was to be adduced on the\r\n  trial of Stephen, the attorney for the commonwealth would exercise a\r\n  proper discretion in entering a _nolle prosequi_ as to him, and the\r\n  court would approve its being done. A _nolle prosequi_ was entered\r\n  accordingly, and both gentlemen discharged.\r\n\r\n  “It may be added that two days were consumed in exhibiting the\r\n  evidence, and that the trial was by a jury of Clarke County. Both\r\n  the parties had been on bail from the time of their arrest, and were\r\n  continued on bail whilst the trial was depending.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Let us admit that the evidence does not prove the legal crime of\r\n  homicide: what candid man can doubt, after reading this _ex parte_\r\n  version of it, that the slave died in consequence of the punishment\r\n  inflicted upon him?\r\n\r\n  In criminal prosecutions the federal constitution guarantees to the\r\n  accused the right to a public trial by an impartial jury; the right\r\n  to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be\r\n  confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory\r\n  process for obtaining witness in his favor; and to have the\r\n  assistance of counsel; guarantees necessary to secure innocence\r\n  against hasty or vindictive judgment,—absolutely necessary to\r\n  prevent injustice. Grant that they were not intended for slaves;\r\n  every master of a slave must feel that they are still morally\r\n  binding upon him. He is the sole judge; he alone determines the\r\n  offence, the proof requisite to establish it, and the amount of the\r\n  punishment. The slave then has a peculiar claim upon him for\r\n  justice. When charged with a crime, common humanity requires that he\r\n  should be informed of it, that he should be confronted with the\r\n  witnesses against him, that he should be permitted to show evidence\r\n  in favor of his innocence.\r\n\r\n  But how was poor Lewis treated? The son of Castleman said he had\r\n  discovered who stole the money; and it was forthwith “determined\r\n  that the offenders should be punished at once, and _before they\r\n  should know of the discovery that had been made_.” Punished without\r\n  a hearing! Punished on the testimony of a house-servant, the nature\r\n  of which does not appear to have been inquired into by the court!\r\n  Not a word is said which authorizes the belief that any careful\r\n  examination was made, as it respects their guilt. Lewis and Reuben\r\n  were assumed, on loose evidence, without deliberate investigation,\r\n  to be guilty; and then, without allowing them to attempt to show\r\n  their evidence, they were whipped, until a confession of guilt was\r\n  extorted by bodily pain.\r\n\r\n  Is this Virginia justice?\r\n\r\n  Lewis was punished with “a _broad leathern strap_,”—he was “punished\r\n  severely:” this we do not need to be told. A “broad leathern strap”\r\n  is well adapted to severity of punishment. “Nor was it pretended,”\r\n  the account says, “in any quarter, that this punishment implicated\r\n  either his life or his health.” This is false; it was expressly\r\n  stated in the newspaper accounts at the time, and such was the\r\n  general impression in the neighborhood, that the punishment did very\r\n  severely implicate his life. But more of this anon.\r\n\r\n  Lewis was left. A chain was fastened around his neck, so as not to\r\n  choke him, and secured to the joist above, leaving a slack of about\r\n  a foot and a half. Remaining in an upright position, he was secure\r\n  against strangulation, but he could neither sit nor kneel; and\r\n  should he faint, he would be choked to death. The account says that\r\n  they fastened him thus for the purpose of securing him. If this had\r\n  been the sole object, it could have been accomplished by safer and\r\n  less cruel methods, as every reader must know. This mode of securing\r\n  him was intended probably to intimidate him, and, at the same time,\r\n  afforded some gratification to the vindictive feeling which\r\n  controlled the actors in this foul transaction. The man whom they\r\n  left to watch Lewis said that, after remaining there about half an\r\n  hour, he went home; and Lewis was then alive. The Castlemans say\r\n  that, after punishing Reuben, they returned, having been absent not\r\n  more than half an hour, and they found him hanging by the neck,\r\n  dead. We direct attention to this part of the testimony, to show how\r\n  loose the statements were which went to make up the evidence.\r\n\r\n  Why was Lewis chained at all, and a man left to watch him? “To\r\n  secure him,” say the Castlemans. Is it customary to chain slaves in\r\n  this manner, and set a watch over them, after severe punishment, to\r\n  prevent their running away? If the punishment of Lewis had not been\r\n  unusual, and if he had not been threatened with another infliction\r\n  on their return, there would have been no necessity for chaining\r\n  him.\r\n\r\n  The testimony of the man left to watch represents him as desperate,\r\n  apparently, with pain and fright. “Lewis asked for a box to stand\r\n  on:” why? Was he not suffering from pain and exhaustion, and did he\r\n  not wish to rest himself, without danger of slow strangulation?\r\n  Again: he asked for “something he could jump off from;” “after the\r\n  Castlemans left, he expressed a fear when they came back that he\r\n  would be whipped again; and said, if he had a knife, and could get\r\n  one hand loose, he would cut his throat.”\r\n\r\n  The punishment that could drive him to such desperation must have\r\n  been horrible.\r\n\r\n  How long they were absent we know not, for the testimony on this\r\n  point is contradictory. They found him hanging by the neck, dead,\r\n  “his feet thrown behind him, his knees a few inches from the floor,\r\n  and his head thrown forward,”—just the position he would naturally\r\n  fall into, had he sunk from exhaustion. They wish it to appear that\r\n  he hung himself. Could this be proved (we need hardly say that it is\r\n  not), it would relieve but slightly the dark picture of their guilt.\r\n  The probability is that he sank, exhausted by suffering, fatigue and\r\n  fear. As to the testimony of “surgeons,” founded upon a post-mortem\r\n  examination of the brain and blood-vessels, “that the subject could\r\n  not have fainted before strangulation,” it is not worthy of\r\n  consideration. We know something of the fallacies and fooleries of\r\n  such examinations.\r\n\r\n  From all we can learn, the only evidence relied on by the\r\n  prosecution was that white man employed by the Castlemans. He was\r\n  dependent upon them for work. Other evidence might have been\r\n  obtained; why it was not is for the prosecuting attorney to explain.\r\n  To prove what we say, and to show that justice has not been done in\r\n  this horrible affair, we publish the following communication from an\r\n  old and highly-respectable citizen of this place, and who is very\r\n  far from being an Abolitionist. The slave-holders whom he mentions\r\n  are well known here, and would have promptly appeared in the case,\r\n  had the prosecution, which was aware of their readiness, summoned\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “_To the Editor of the Era_:\r\n\r\n  “I see that Castleman, who lately had a trial for whipping a slave\r\n  to death, in Virginia, was ‘_triumphantly acquitted_,’—as many\r\n  expected. There are three persons in this city, with whom I am\r\n  acquainted, who staid at Castleman’s the same night in which this\r\n  awful tragedy was enacted. They heard the dreadful lashing and the\r\n  heart-rending screams and entreaties of the sufferer. They implored\r\n  the only white man they could find on the premises, not engaged in\r\n  the bloody work, to interpose; but for a long time he refused, on\r\n  the ground that he was a dependent, and was afraid to give offence;\r\n  and that, moreover, they had been drinking, and he was in fear for\r\n  his own life, should he say a word that would be displeasing to\r\n  them. He did, however, venture, and returned and reported the cruel\r\n  manner in which the slaves were chained, and lashed, and secured in\r\n  a blacksmith’s vice. In the morning, when they ascertained that one\r\n  of the slaves was dead, they were so shocked and indignant that they\r\n  refused to eat in the house, and reproached Castleman with his\r\n  cruelty. He expressed his regret that the slave had died, and\r\n  especially as he had ascertained that he _was innocent_ of the\r\n  accusation for which he had suffered. The idea was that he had\r\n  fainted from exhaustion; and, the chain being round his neck, he was\r\n  strangled. The persons I refer to are themselves slave-holders,—but\r\n  their feelings were so harrowed and lacerated that they could not\r\n  sleep (two of them are ladies); and for many nights afterwards their\r\n  rest was disturbed, and their dreams made frightful, by the\r\n  appalling recollection.\r\n\r\n  “These persons would have been material witnesses, and would have\r\n  willingly attended on the part of the prosecution. The knowledge\r\n  they had of the case was communicated to the proper authorities, yet\r\n  their attendance was not required. The only witness was that\r\n  dependent who considered his own life in danger.\r\n\r\n                                              “Yours, &c.,      J. F.”\r\n\r\n  The account, as published by the friends of the accused parties,\r\n  shows a case of extreme cruelty. The statements made by our\r\n  correspondent prove that the truth has not been fully revealed, and\r\n  that justice has been baffled. The result of the trial shows how\r\n  irresponsible is the power of a master over his slave; and that\r\n  whatever security the latter has is to be sought in the humanity of\r\n  the former, not in the guarantees of law. Against the cruelty of an\r\n  inhuman master he has really no safeguard.\r\n\r\n  Our conduct in relation to this case, deferring all notice of it in\r\n  our columns till a legal investigation could be had, shows that we\r\n  are not disposed to be captious towards our slave-holding\r\n  countrymen. In no unkind spirit have we examined this lamentable\r\n  case; but we must expose the utter repugnance of the slave system to\r\n  the proper administration of justice. The newspapers of Virginia\r\n  generally publish the account from the _Spirit of Jefferson_,\r\n  without comment. They are evidently not satisfied that justice was\r\n  done; they doubtless will deny that the accused were guilty of\r\n  homicide, legally; but they will not deny that they were guilty of\r\n  an atrocity which should brand them forever, in a Christian country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n  PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED.—STATE _v._ LEGREE; A CASE NOT IN THE BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a review of all the legal cases which have hitherto been presented,\r\nand of the principles established in the judicial decisions upon them,\r\nthe following facts must be apparent to the reader:\r\n\r\n_First_, That masters do, now and then, kill slaves by the torture.\r\n\r\n_Second_, That the fact of so killing a slave is not of itself held\r\npresumption of murder, in slave jurisprudence.\r\n\r\n_Third_, That the slave in the act of resistance to his master may\r\nalways be killed.\r\n\r\nFrom these things it will be seen to follow, that, if the facts of the\r\ndeath of Tom had been fully proved by two white witnesses, in open\r\ncourt, Legree could not have been held by any _consistent_ interpreter\r\nof slave-law to be a murderer; for Tom was in the act of resistance to\r\nthe will of his master. His master had laid a command on him, in the\r\npresence of other slaves. Tom had deliberately refused to obey the\r\ncommand. The master commenced chastisement, to reduce him to obedience.\r\nAnd it is evident, at the first glance, to every one, that, if the law\r\ndoes not sustain him in enforcing obedience in such a case, there is an\r\nend of the whole slave power. No Southern court would dare to decide\r\nthat Legree did wrong to continue the punishment, as long as Tom\r\ncontinued the insubordination. Legree stood by him every moment of the\r\ntime, pressing him to yield, and offering to let him go as soon as he\r\ndid yield. Tom’s resistance was _insurrection_. It was an example which\r\ncould not be allowed, for a moment, on any Southern plantation. By the\r\nexpress words of the constitution of Georgia, and by the understanding\r\nand usage of all slave-law, the power of life and death is always left\r\nin the hands of the master, in exigences like this. This is not a case\r\nlike that of Souther v. The Commonwealth. The victim of Souther was not\r\nin a state of resistance or insurrection. The punishment, in his case,\r\nwas a simple vengeance for a past offence, and not an attempt to reduce\r\nhim to subordination.\r\n\r\nThere is no principle of slave jurisprudence by which a man could be\r\npronounced a murderer, for acting as Legree did, in his circumstances.\r\nEverybody must see that such an admission would strike at the\r\nfoundations of the slave system. To be sure, Tom was in a state of\r\ninsurrection for conscience’ sake. But the law does not, and cannot,\r\ncontemplate that the negro shall have a conscience independent of his\r\nmaster’s. To allow that the negro may refuse to obey his master whenever\r\nhe thinks that obedience would be wrong, would be to produce universal\r\nanarchy. If Tom had been allowed to disobey his master in this case, for\r\nconscience’ sake, the next day Sambo would have had a case of\r\nconscience, and Quimbo the next. Several of them might very justly have\r\nthought that it was a sin to work as they did. The mulatto woman would\r\nhave remembered that the command of God forbade her to take another\r\nhusband. Mothers might have considered that it was more their duty to\r\nstay at home and take care of their children, when they were young and\r\nfeeble, than to work for Mr. Legree in the cotton-field. There would be\r\nno end to the havoc made upon cotton-growing operations, were the negro\r\nallowed the right of maintaining his own conscience on moral subjects.\r\nIf the slave system is a right system, and ought to be maintained, Mr.\r\nLegree ought not to be blamed for his conduct in this case; for he did\r\nonly what was absolutely essential to maintain the system; and Tom died\r\nin fanatical and foolhardy resistance to “the powers that be, which are\r\nordained of God.” He followed a sentimental impulse of his desperately\r\ndepraved heart, and neglected those “solid teachings of the written\r\nword,” which, as recently elucidated, have proved so refreshing to\r\neminent political men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                    THE TRIUMPH OF JUSTICE OVER LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving been obliged to record so many trials in which justice has been\r\nturned away backward by the hand of law, and equity and common humanity\r\nhave been kept out by the bolt and bar of logic, it is a relief to the\r\nmind to find one recent trial recorded, in North Carolina, in which the\r\nnobler feelings of the human heart have burst over formalized limits,\r\nand where the prosecution appears to have been conducted by _men_, who\r\nwere not ashamed of possessing in their bosoms that very dangerous and\r\nmost illogical agitator, a human heart. It is true that, in giving this\r\ntrial, very sorrowful, but inevitable, inferences will force themselves\r\nupon the mind, as to that state of public feeling which allowed such\r\noutrages to be perpetrated in open daylight, in the capital of North\r\nCarolina, upon a hapless woman. It would seem that the public were too\r\ntruly instructed in the awful doctrine pronounced by Judge Ruffin, that\r\n“THE POWER OF THE MASTER MUST BE ABSOLUTE,” to think of interfering\r\nwhile the poor creature was dragged, barefoot and bleeding, at a horse’s\r\nneck, at the rate of five miles an hour, through the streets of Raleigh.\r\nIt seems, also, that the most horrible brutalities and enormities that\r\ncould be conceived of were _witnessed_, without any efficient\r\ninterference, by a number of the citizens, among whom we see the name of\r\nthe Hon. W. H. Haywood, of Raleigh. It is a comfort to find the\r\nattorney-general, in this case, speaking as a man ought to speak.\r\nCertainly there can be no occasion to wish to pervert or overstate the\r\ndread workings of the slave system, or to leave out the few comforting\r\nand encouraging features, however small the encouragement of them may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThe case is now presented, as narrated from the published reports, by\r\nDr. Bailey, editor of the _National Era_; a man whose candor and\r\nfairness need no indorsing, as every line that he writes speaks for\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe reader may at first be surprised to find slave testimony in the\r\ncourt, till he recollects that it is a slave that is on trial, the\r\ntestimony of slaves being only null when it concerns whites.\r\n\r\n                         AN INTERESTING TRIAL.\r\n\r\n  We find in one of the Raleigh (North Carolina) papers, of June 5,\r\n  1851, a report of an interesting trial, at the spring term of the\r\n  Superior Court. Mima, a slave, was indicted for the murder of her\r\n  master, William Smith, of Johnston County, on the night of the 29th\r\n  of November, 1850. The evidence for the prosecution was Sidney, a\r\n  slave-boy, twelve years old, who testified that, in the night, he\r\n  and a slave-girl, named Jane, were roused from sleep by the call of\r\n  their master, Smith, who had returned home. They went out, and found\r\n  Mima tied to his horse’s neck, with two ropes, one round her neck,\r\n  the other round her hands. Deceased carried her into the house,\r\n  jerking the rope fastened to her neck, and tied her to a post. He\r\n  called for something to eat, threw her a piece of bread, and, after\r\n  he had done, beat her on her naked back with a large piece of\r\n  light-wood, giving her many hard blows. In a short time, deceased\r\n  went out of the house, for a special purpose, witness accompanying\r\n  him with a torchlight, and hearing him say that he intended “to use\r\n  the prisoner up.” The light was extinguished, and he reëntered the\r\n  house for the purpose of lighting it. Jane was there; but the\r\n  prisoner had been untied, and was not there. While lighting his\r\n  torch, he heard blows outside, and heard the deceased cry out, two\r\n  or three times, “O, Leah! O, Leah!” Witness and Jane went out, saw\r\n  the deceased bloody and struggling, were frightened, ran back, and\r\n  shut themselves up. Leah, it seems, was mother of the prisoner, and\r\n  had run off two years, on account of cruel treatment by the\r\n  deceased.\r\n\r\n  Smith was speechless and unconscious till he died, the following\r\n  morning, of the wounds inflicted on him.\r\n\r\n  It was proved on the trial that Carroll, a white man, living about a\r\n  mile from the house of the deceased, and whose wife was said to be\r\n  the illegitimate daughter of Smith, had in his possession, the\r\n  morning of the murder, the receipt given the deceased by sheriff\r\n  High, the day before, for jail fees, and a note for thirty-five\r\n  dollars, due deceased from one Wiley Price, which Carroll collected\r\n  a short time thereafter; also the chest-keys of the deceased; and no\r\n  proof was offered to show how Carroll came into possession of these\r\n  articles.\r\n\r\n  The following portion of the testimony discloses facts so horrible,\r\n  and so disgraceful to the people who tolerated, in broad daylight,\r\n  conduct which would have shamed the devil, that we copy it just as\r\n  we find it in the Raleigh paper. The scene, remember, is the city of\r\n  Raleigh.\r\n\r\n  “The defence was then opened. James Harris, C. W. D. Hutchings, and\r\n  Hon. W. H. Haywood, of Raleigh; John Cooper, of Wake; Joseph Hane\r\n  and others, of Johnston, were examined for the prisoner. The\r\n  substance of their testimony was as follows: On the forenoon of\r\n  Friday, 29th of November last, deceased took prisoner from Raleigh\r\n  jail, tied her round the neck and wrist; ropes were then latched to\r\n  the horse’s neck; he cursed the prisoner several times, got on his\r\n  horse, and started off; when he got opposite the Telegraph office,\r\n  on Fayetteville-street, he pulled her shoes and stockings off,\r\n  cursed her again, went off in a swift trot, the prisoner running\r\n  after him, doing apparently all she could to keep up; passed round\r\n  by Peck’s store; prisoner seemed very humble and submissive; took\r\n  down the street east of the capitol, going at the rate of five miles\r\n  an hour; continued this gait until he passed O. Rork’s corner, about\r\n  half or three-quarters of a mile from the capitol; that he reached\r\n  Cooper’s (one of the witnesses), thirteen miles from Raleigh, about\r\n  four o’clock, P. M.; that it was raining very hard; deceased got off\r\n  his horse, turned it loose with prisoner tied to its neck; witness\r\n  went to take deceased’s horse to stable; heard great lamentations at\r\n  the house; hurried back; saw his little daughter running through the\r\n  rain from the house, much frightened; got there; deceased was\r\n  gouging prisoner in the eyes, and she making outcries; made him\r\n  stop; became vexed, and insisted upon leaving; did leave in a short\r\n  time, in the rain, sun about an hour high; when he left, prisoner\r\n  was tied as she was before; her arms and fingers were very much\r\n  swollen; the rope around her wrist was small, and had sunk deep into\r\n  the flesh, almost covered with it; that around the neck was large,\r\n  and tied in a slipknot; deceased would jerk it every now and then;\r\n  when jerked, it would choke prisoner; she was barefoot and bleeding;\r\n  deceased was met some time after dark, in about six miles of home,\r\n  being twenty-four or twenty-five from Raleigh.”\r\n\r\n  Why did they not strike the monster to the earth, and punish him for\r\n  his infernal brutality?\r\n\r\n  The attorney-general conducted the prosecution with evident\r\n  loathing. The defence argued, first, that the evidence was\r\n  insufficient to fasten the crime upon the prisoner; secondly, that,\r\n  should the jury be satisfied beyond a rational doubt that the\r\n  prisoner committed the act charged, it would yet be only\r\n  manslaughter.\r\n\r\n  “A single blow between equals would mitigate a killing instanter\r\n  from murder to manslaughter. It could not, in law, be anything more,\r\n  if done under the _furor brevis_ of passion. But the rule was\r\n  different as between master and slave. It was necessary that this\r\n  should be, to preserve the subordination of the slave. The\r\n  prisoner’s counsel then examined the authorities at length, and\r\n  contended that the prisoner’s case came within the rule laid down in\r\n  The State _v._ Will (1 Dev. and Bat. 121). The rule there given by\r\n  Judge Gaston is this: ‘If a slave, in defence of his life, and under\r\n  circumstances strongly calculated to excite his passions of terror\r\n  and resentment, kill his overseer or master, the homicide is, by\r\n  such circumstances, mitigated to manslaughter.’ The cruelties of the\r\n  deceased to the prisoner were grievous and long-continued. They\r\n  would have shocked a barbarian. The savage loves and thirsts for\r\n  blood; but the acts of civilized life have not afforded him such\r\n  refinement of torture as was here exhibited.”\r\n\r\n  The attorney-general, after discussing the law, appealed to the jury\r\n  “not to suffer the prejudice which the counsel for the defence had\r\n  attempted to create against the deceased (_whose conduct, he\r\n  admitted, was disgraceful to human nature_) to influence their\r\n  judgments in deciding whether the act of the prisoner was criminal\r\n  or not, and what degree of criminality attached to it. He desired\r\n  the prisoner _to have a fair and impartial trial_. He wished her to\r\n  receive _the benefit of every rational doubt_. It _was her right,\r\n  however humble her condition; he hoped he had not that heart, as he\r\n  certainly had not the right by virtue of his office, to ask in her\r\n  case for anything more than he would ask from the highest and\r\n  proudest of the land on trial_, that the jury should decide\r\n  according to the evidence, and vindicate the violated law.”\r\n\r\n  These were honorable sentiments.\r\n\r\n  After an able charge by Judge Ellis, the jury retired, and, after\r\n  having remained out several hours, returned with a verdict of NOT\r\n  GUILTY. Of course, we see not how they could hesitate to come to\r\n  this verdict at once.\r\n\r\n  The correspondent who furnishes the _Register_ with a report of the\r\n  case says:\r\n\r\n  “It excited an intense interest in the community in which it\r\n  occurred, and, although it develops a series of cruelties shocking\r\n  to human nature, the result of the trial, nevertheless, vindicates\r\n  the benignity and justice of our laws towards that class of our\r\n  population whose condition Northern fanaticism has so carefully and\r\n  grossly misrepresented, for their own purposes of selfishness,\r\n  agitation, and crime.”\r\n\r\n  We have no disposition to misrepresent the condition of the slaves,\r\n  or to disparage the laws of North Carolina; but we ask, with a\r\n  sincere desire to know the truth, Do the _laws_ of North Carolina\r\n  allow a master to practise such horrible cruelties upon his slaves\r\n  as Smith was guilty of, and would the _public sentiment_ of the city\r\n  of Raleigh permit a repetition of such enormities as were\r\n  perpetrated in its streets, in the light of day, by that miscreant?\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as the accounts of these various trials contain so many\r\nshocking incidents and particulars the author desires to enter a caution\r\nagainst certain mistaken uses which may be made of them, by\r\nwell-intending persons. The crimes themselves, which form the foundation\r\nof the trials, are not to be considered and spoken of as specimens of\r\nthe _common_ working of the slave system. They are, it is true, the\r\nlogical and legitimate fruits of a system which makes every individual\r\nowner an irresponsible despot. But the actual number of them, compared\r\nwith the whole number of masters, we take pleasure in saying, is small.\r\nIt is an injury to the cause of freedom to ground the argument against\r\nslavery upon the _frequency_ with which such scenes as these occur. It\r\nmisleads the popular mind as to the real issue of the subject. To hear\r\nmany men talk, one would think that they supposed that unless negroes\r\nactually were whipped or burned alive at the rate of two or three dozen\r\na week, there was no harm in slavery. They seem to see nothing in the\r\nsystem but its gross bodily abuses. If these are absent, they think\r\nthere is no harm in it. They do not consider that the twelve hours’\r\ntorture of some poor victim, bleeding away his life, drop by drop, under\r\nthe hands of a SOUTHER, is only a symbol of that more atrocious process\r\nby which the divine, immortal soul is mangled, burned, lacerated, thrown\r\ndown, stamped upon, and suffocated, by the fiend-like force of the\r\ntyrant Slavery. And as, when the torturing work was done, and the poor\r\nsoul flew up to the judgment-seat, to stand there in awful witness,\r\nthere was not a vestige of humanity left in that dishonored body, nor\r\nanything by which it could be said, “See, this was a man!”—so, when\r\nSlavery has finished her legitimate work upon the soul, and trodden out\r\nevery spark of manliness, and honor, and self-respect, and natural\r\naffection, and conscience, and religious sentiment, then there is\r\nnothing left _in the soul_, by which to say, “This was a man!” and it\r\nbecomes necessary for judges to construct grave legal arguments to prove\r\nthat the slave is a human being.\r\n\r\nSuch _extreme_ cases of bodily abuse from the despotic power of slavery\r\nare comparatively rare. Perhaps they may be paralleled by cases brought\r\nto light in the criminal jurisprudence of other countries. They might,\r\nperhaps, have happened anywhere; at any rate, we will concede that they\r\nmight. But where under the sun did _such_ TRIALS, of such cases, ever\r\ntake place, in any nation professing to be free and Christian? The\r\nreader of English history will perhaps recur to the trials under Judge\r\nJeffries, as a parallel. A moment’s reflection will convince him that\r\nthere is no parallel between the cases. The decisions of Jeffries were\r\nthe decisions of a monster, who violently wrested law from its\r\nlegitimate course, to gratify his own fiendish nature. The decisions of\r\nAmerican slave-law have been, for the most part, the decisions of\r\nhonorable and humane men, who have wrested from their natural course the\r\nmost humane feelings, to fulfil the mandates of a cruel law.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Jeffries, the sacred forms of the administration of\r\njustice were violated. In the case of the American decisions, every form\r\nhas been maintained. Revolting to humanity as these decisions appear,\r\nthey are strictly logical and legal.\r\n\r\nTherefore, again, we say, Where, ever, in any nation professing to be\r\ncivilized and Christian, did _such_ TRIALS, of _such cases_, take place?\r\nWhen were ever _such_ legal arguments made? When, ever, such legal\r\nprinciples judicially affirmed? Was ever such a trial held in England as\r\nthat in Virginia, of SOUTHER _v._ THE COMMONWEALTH? Was it ever\r\nnecessary in England for a judge to declare on the bench, contrary to\r\nthe opinion of a lower court, that the death of an apprentice, by twelve\r\nhours’ torture from his master, _did_ amount to murder in the first\r\ndegree? Was such a decision, if given, accompanied by the affirmation of\r\nthe principle, that any amount of torture inflicted by the master,\r\n_short of the point of death_, was not indictable? Not being read in\r\nEnglish law, the writer cannot say; but there is strong impression from\r\nwithin that such a decision as this would have shaken the whole island\r\nof Great Britain; and that such a case as _Souther_ v. _The\r\nCommonwealth_ would never have been forgotten under the sun. Yet it is\r\nprobable that very few persons in the United States ever heard of the\r\ncase, or ever would have heard of it, had it not been quoted by the New\r\nYork _Courier and Enquirer_ as an overwhelming example of legal\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nThe horror of the whole matter is, that more than one such case should\r\never need to happen in a country, in order to make the whole community\r\nfeel, as one man, that such power ought not to be left in the hands of a\r\nmaster. How many such cases do people _wish_ to have happen?—how many\r\n_must_ happen, before they will learn that utter despotic power is not\r\nto be trusted in any hands? If one white man’s son or brother had been\r\ntreated in this way, under the law of _apprenticeship_, the whole\r\ncountry would have trembled, from Louisiana to Maine, till that law had\r\nbeen altered. They forget that the black man has also a father. It is\r\n“He that sitteth upon the circle of the heavens, who bringeth the\r\nprinces to nothing, and maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.” He\r\nhath said that “When he maketh inquisition for blood, he FORGETTETH NOT\r\nthe cry of the humble.” That blood which has fallen so despised to the\r\nearth,—that blood which lawyers have quibbled over, in the quiet of\r\nlegal nonchalance, discussing in great ease whether it fell by murder in\r\nthe first or second degree,—HE will one day reckon for as the blood of\r\nhis own child. He “is not slack concerning his promises, as some men\r\ncount slackness, but is long-suffering to usward;” but the day of\r\nvengeance is surely coming, and the year of his redeemed is in his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAnother court will sit upon these trials, when the Son of Man shall come\r\nin his glory. It will be not alone Souther, and such as he, that will be\r\narraigned there; but all those in this nation, north and south, who have\r\nabetted the system, and made the laws which MADE Souther what he was. In\r\n_that_ court negro testimony will be received, if never before; and the\r\njudges and the counsellors, and the chief men, and the mighty men,\r\nmarshalled to that awful bar, will say to the mountains and the rocks,\r\n“Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne,\r\nand from the wrath of the Lamb.”\r\n\r\nThe wrath of the Lamb! Think of it! Think that Jesus Christ has been\r\npresent, a witness,—a silent witness through every such scene of torture\r\nand anguish,—a silent witness in every such court, calmly hearing the\r\nevidence given in, the lawyers pleading, the bills filed, and cases\r\nappealed! And think what a heart Jesus Christ has, and with what\r\nage-long patience he has suffered! What awful depths are there in that\r\nword, LONG-SUFFERING! and what must be that wrath, when, after ages of\r\nendurance, this dread accumulation of wrong and anguish comes up at last\r\nto judgment!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n      A COMPARISON OF THE ROMAN LAW OF SLAVERY WITH THE AMERICAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer has expressed the opinion that the American law of slavery,\r\ntaken throughout, is a more severe one than that of any other civilized\r\nnation, ancient or modern, if we except, perhaps, that of the Spartans.\r\nShe has not at hand the means of comparing French and Spanish\r\nslave-codes; but, as it is a common remark that Roman slavery was much\r\nmore severe than any that has ever existed in America, it will be well\r\nto compare the Roman with the American law. We therefore present a\r\ndescription of the Roman slave-law, as quoted by William Jay, Esq., from\r\nBlair’s “_Inquiry into the State of Slavery among the Romans_,” giving\r\nsuch references to _American authorities_ as will enable the reader to\r\nmake his own comparison, and to draw his own inferences.\r\n\r\n  I. _The slave had no protection against the avarice, rage, or lust\r\n  of the master, whose authority was founded in absolute property; and\r\n  the bondman was viewed less as a human being subject to arbitrary\r\n  dominion, than as an inferior animal, dependent wholly on the will\r\n  of his owner._\r\n\r\nSee law of South Carolina, in Stroud’s “_Sketch of the Laws of\r\nSlavery_,” p. 23.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2 Brev. Dig. 229. Prince’s Dig. 446. Cobb’s Dig. 971.]\r\n\r\n  Slaves shall be deemed, sold, taken, reputed and adjudged in law to\r\n  be _chattels personal_ in the hands of their owners and possessors,\r\n  and their executors, administrators and assigns, to all intents,\r\n  constructions, and purposes whatever.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lou. Civil Code, art. 35. Stroud’s Sketch, p. 22.]\r\n\r\n  A slave is one who is in the power of a master to whom he belongs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Judge Ruffin’s Decision in the case of The State _v._ Mann.\r\n           Wheeler’s Law of Slavery, 246.]\r\n\r\n  ——Such obedience is the consequence only of uncontrolled authority\r\n  over the body. There is nothing else which can operate to produce\r\n  the effect. The power of the master must be _absolute_, to render\r\n  the submission of the slave perfect.\r\n\r\n  II. _At first, the master possessed the uncontrolled power of life\r\n  and death._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Judge Clarke, in case of State of Miss. _v._ Jones.\r\n           Wheeler, 252.]\r\n\r\n  At a very early period in Virginia, the power of life over slaves\r\n  was _given by statute_.\r\n\r\n  III. _He might kill, mutilate or torture his slaves, for any or no\r\n  offence; he might force them to become gladiators or prostitutes_.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of killing is now somewhat abridged; as to mutilation and\r\ntorture, see the case of _Souther_ v. _The Commonwealth_, 7 _Grattan_,\r\n673, quoted in Chapter III., above. Also _State_ v. _Mann_, in the same\r\nchapter, from _Wheeler_, p. 244.\r\n\r\n  IV. _The temporary unions of male with female slaves were formed and\r\n  dissolved at his command; families and friends were separated when\r\n  he pleased._\r\n\r\nSee the decision of Judge Mathews in the case of _Girod_ v. _Lewis_,\r\nWheeler, 199:\r\n\r\n  It is clear, that slaves have no legal capacity to assent to any\r\n  contract. With the consent of their master, they may marry, and\r\n  their moral power to agree to such a contract or connection as that\r\n  of marriage cannot be doubted; but whilst in a state of slavery it\r\n  cannot produce any civil effect, because slaves are deprived of all\r\n  civil rights.\r\n\r\nSee also the chapter below on “the separation of families,” and the\r\nfiles of _any_ southern newspaper, _passim_.\r\n\r\n  V. _The laws recognized no obligation upon the owners of slaves, to\r\n  furnish them with food and clothing, or to take care of them in\r\n  sickness._\r\n\r\nThe extent to which this deficiency in the Roman law has been supplied\r\nin the American, by “_protective acts_,” has been exhibited above.[13]\r\n\r\n  VI. _Slaves could have no property but by the sufferance of their\r\n  master, for whom they acquired everything, and with whom they could\r\n  form no engagements which could be binding on him._\r\n\r\nThe following chapter will show how far American legislation is in\r\nadvance of that of the Romans, in that it makes it a penal offence on\r\nthe part of the master to permit his slave to hold property, and a crime\r\non the part of the slave to be so permitted. For the present purpose, we\r\ngive an extract from the Civil code of Louisiana, as quoted by Judge\r\nStroud:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil Code, Article 35. Stroud, p. 22.]\r\n\r\n  A slave is one who is in the power of a master to whom he belongs.\r\n  The master may sell him, dispose of his person, his industry, and\r\n  his labor; he can do nothing, possess nothing, nor acquire anything\r\n  but what must belong to his master.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wh’ler’s Law of Slavery, p. 246. State _v._ Mann.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Judge Ruffin, a slave is “one doomed in his own person, and\r\nhis posterity, to live without knowledge, and without the capacity to\r\nmake anything his own, and to toil that another may reap the fruits.”\r\n\r\nWith reference to the binding power of engagements between master and\r\nslave, the following decisions from the United States Digest are in\r\npoint (7, p. 449):\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gist _v._ Toohey, 2 Rich. 424.]\r\n\r\n  All the acquisitions of the slave in possession are the property of\r\n  his master, notwithstanding the promise of his master that the slave\r\n  shall have certain of them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n  A slave paid money which he had earned over and above his wages, for\r\n  the purchase of his children into the hands of B, and B purchased\r\n  such children with the money. Held that the master of such slave was\r\n  entitled to recover the money of B.\r\n\r\n  VII. _The master might transfer his rights by either sale or gift,\r\n  or might bequeath them by will._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Law of S. Carolina. Cobb’s Digest, 971.]\r\n\r\n  Slaves shall be deemed, sold, taken, reputed and adjudged in law, to\r\n  be chattels personal in the hands of their owners and possessors,\r\n  and their executors, administrators, and assigns, to all intents,\r\n  constructions, and purposes whatsoever.\r\n\r\n  VIII. _A master selling, giving, or bequeathing a slave, sometimes\r\n  made it a provision that he should never be carried abroad, or that\r\n  he should be manumitted on a fixed day; or that, on the other hand,\r\n  he should never be emancipated, or that he should be kept in chains\r\n  for life._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Williams _v._ Ash, 1 How. U. S. Rep. 1. 5 U. S. Dig. 792, §\r\n           5.]\r\n\r\nWe hardly think that a provision that a slave should never be\r\nemancipated, or that he should be kept in chains for life, would be\r\nsustained. A provision that the slave should not be carried out of the\r\nstate, or sold, and that on the happening of either event he should be\r\nfree, has been sustained.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Blair’s account of Roman slavery is devoted rather to\r\nthe practices of masters than the state of the law itself. Surely, the\r\nwriter is not called upon to exhibit in the society of enlightened,\r\nrepublican and Christian America, in the nineteenth century, a parallel\r\nto the atrocities committed in pagan Rome, under the sceptre of the\r\npersecuting Cæsars, when the amphitheatre was the favorite resort of the\r\nmost refined of her citizens, as well as the great “school of morals”\r\nfor the multitude. A few references only will show, as far as we desire\r\nto show, how much safer it is now to trust man with absolute power over\r\nhis fellow, than it was then.\r\n\r\n  IX. _While slaves turned the hand-mill they were generally chained,\r\n  and had a broad wooden collar, to prevent them from eating the\r\n  grain. The_ FURCA, _which in later language means a gibbet, was, in\r\n  older dialect, used to denote a wooden fork or collar, which was\r\n  made to bear upon their shoulders, or around their necks, as a mark\r\n  of disgrace, as much as an uneasy burden._\r\n\r\nThe reader has already seen, in Chapter V., that this instrument of\r\ndegradation has been in use, in our own day, in certain of the slave\r\nstates, under the express sanction and protection of statute laws;\r\nalthough the material is different, and the construction doubtless\r\nimproved by modern ingenuity.\r\n\r\n  X. _Fetters and chains were much used for punishment or restraint,\r\n  and were, in some instances, worn by slaves during life, through the\r\n  sole authority of the master. Porters at the gates of the rich were\r\n  generally chained. Field laborers worked for the most part in irons\r\n  posterior to the first ages of the republic._\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of South Carolina specially sanctions the same\r\npractices, by excepting them in the “_protective enactment_,” which\r\ninflicts the penalty of _one hundred pounds_ “in case any person shall\r\nwilfully cut out the tongue,” &c., of a slave, “or shall inflict _any\r\nother cruel_ punishment, _other than_ by whipping or beating with a\r\nhorse-whip, cowskin, switch, or small stick, _or by putting irons on, or\r\nconfining or imprisoning such slave_.”\r\n\r\n  XI. _Some persons made it their business to catch runaway slaves._\r\n\r\nThat such a profession, constituted by the highest legislative authority\r\nin the nation, and rendered respectable by the commendation expressed or\r\nimplied of statesmen and divines, and of newspapers political and\r\nreligious, exists in our midst, _especially in the free states_, is a\r\nfact which is, day by day, making itself too apparent to need testimony.\r\nThe matter seems, however, to be managed in a more perfectly open and\r\nbusiness-like manner in the State of Alabama than elsewhere. Mr. Jay\r\ncites the following advertisement from the _Sumpter County_ (Ala.)\r\n_Whig_:\r\n\r\n                              NEGRO DOGS.\r\n\r\n  The undersigned having bought the entire pack of Negro Dogs (of the\r\n  Hay and Allen stock), he now proposes to catch runaway negroes. His\r\n  charges will be Three Dollars per day for hunting, and Fifteen\r\n  Dollars for catching a runaway. He resides three and one half miles\r\n  north of Livingston, near the lower Jones’ Bluff road.\r\n\r\n                                                       WILLIAM GAMBEL.\r\n\r\n  _Nov. 6, 1845._—6m.\r\n\r\nThe following is copied, _verbatim et literatim_, and with the pictorial\r\nembellishments, from _The Dadeville_ (Ala.) _Banner_, of November 10th,\r\n1852. _The Dadeville Banner_ is “_devoted to politics, literature,\r\neducation, agriculture, &c._”\r\n\r\n                                NOTICE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  The undersigned having an excellent pack of HOUNDS, for trailing and\r\n  catching runaway slaves, informs the public that his prices in\r\n  future will be as follows for such services:\r\n\r\n          For each day employed in hunting or trailing, $2.50\r\n          For catching each slave,                      10.00\r\n          For going over ten miles and catching slaves, 20.00\r\n\r\n  If sent for, the above prices will be exacted in cash. The\r\n  subscriber resides one mile and a half south of Dadeville, Ala.\r\n\r\n                                                             B. BLACK.\r\n\r\n  _Dadeville, Sept. 1, 1852._      1tf\r\n\r\n  XII. _The runaway, when taken, was severely punished by authority of\r\n  the master, or by the judge, at his desire; sometimes with\r\n  crucifixion, amputation of a foot, or by being sent to fight as a\r\n  gladiator with wild beasts; but most frequently by being branded on\r\n  the brow with letters indicative of his crime._\r\n\r\nThat severe punishment would be the lot of the recaptured runaway, every\r\none would suppose, from the “_absolute power_” of the master to inflict\r\nit. That it _is_ inflicted in many cases, it is equally easy and\r\nneedless to prove. The peculiar forms of punishment mentioned above are\r\nnow very much out of vogue, but the following advertisement by Mr.\r\nMicajah Ricks, in the _Raleigh_ (N. C.) _Standard_ of July 18th, 1838,\r\nshows that something of classic taste in torture still lingers in our\r\ndegenerate days.\r\n\r\n  Ran away, a negro woman and two children; a few days before she went\r\n  off, I burnt her with a hot iron, on the left side of her face. I\r\n  tried to make the letter M.\r\n\r\nIt is charming to notice the _naïf_ betrayal of literary pride on the\r\npart of Mr. Ricks. He did not wish that letter M to be taken as a\r\nspecimen of what he could do in the way of writing. The creature would\r\nnot hold still, and he fears the M may be illegible.\r\n\r\nThe above is only one of a long list of advertisements of maimed,\r\ncropped and branded negroes, in the book of Mr. Weld, entitled _American\r\nSlavery as It Is_, p. 77.\r\n\r\n  XIII. _Cruel masters sometimes hired torturers by profession, or had\r\n  such persons in their establishments, to assist them in punishing\r\n  their slaves. The noses and ears and teeth of slaves were often in\r\n  danger from an enraged owner; and sometimes the eyes of a great\r\n  offender were put out. Crucifixion was very frequently made the fate\r\n  of a wretched slave for a trifling misconduct, or from mere\r\n  caprice._\r\n\r\nFor justification of such practices as these, we refer again to that\r\nhorrible list of maimed and mutilated men, advertised by slaveholders\r\nthemselves, in Weld’s _American Slavery as It Is_, p. 77. We recall the\r\nreader’s attention to the evidence of the monster Kephart, given in Part\r\nI. As to crucifixion, we presume that there are wretches whose religious\r\nscruples would deter them from this particular form of torture, who\r\nwould not hesitate to inflict equal cruelties by other means; as the\r\nGreek pirate, during a massacre in the season of Lent, was\r\nconscience-stricken at having tasted a drop of blood. We presume?—Let\r\nany one but read again, if he can, the sickening details of that twelve\r\nhours’ torture of Souther’s slave, and say how much more merciful is\r\nAmerican slavery than Roman.\r\n\r\nThe last item in Blair’s description of Roman slavery is the following:\r\n\r\n  _By a decree passed by the Senate, if a master was murdered when his\r\n  slaves might possibly have aided him, all his household within reach\r\n  were held as implicated, and deserving of death; and Tacitus relates\r\n  an instance in which a family of four hundred were all executed._\r\n\r\nTo this alone, of all the atrocities of the slavery of old heathen Rome,\r\ndo we fail to find a parallel in the slavery of the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThere are other respects, in which American legislation has reached a\r\nrefinement in tyranny of which the despots of those early days never\r\nconceived. The following is the language of Gibbon:\r\n\r\n  Hope, the best comfort of our imperfect condition, was not denied to\r\n  the Roman slave; and if he had any opportunity of rendering himself\r\n  either useful or agreeable, he might very naturally expect that the\r\n  diligence and fidelity of a few years would be rewarded with the\r\n  inestimable gift of freedom. * * * Without destroying the\r\n  distinction of ranks, a distant prospect of freedom and honors was\r\n  presented even to those whom pride and prejudice almost disdained to\r\n  number among the human species.[14]\r\n\r\n  The youths of promising genius were instructed in the arts and\r\n  sciences, and their price was ascertained by the degree of their\r\n  skill and talents. Almost every profession, either liberal or\r\n  mechanical, might be found in the household of an opulent\r\n  senator.[15]\r\n\r\nThe following chapter will show how “the best comfort” which Gibbon knew\r\nfor human adversity is taken away from the American slave; how he is\r\ndenied the commonest privileges of education and mental improvement, and\r\nhow the whole tendency of the unhappy system, under which he is in\r\nbondage, is to take from him the consolations of religion itself, and to\r\ndegrade him from our common humanity, and common brotherhood with the\r\nSon of God.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  See also the case of _State_ v. _Abram, 10 Ala. 928. 7 U.

II.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  Ibid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n                    THE MEN BETTER THAN THEIR LAWS.\r\n\r\n         Judgment is turned away backward,\r\n         And Justice standeth afar off;\r\n         For Truth is fallen in the street,\r\n         And Equity cannot enter.\r\n         Yea, Truth faileth;\r\n         And HE THAT DEPARTETH FROM EVIL MAKETH HIMSELF A PREY.\r\n\r\n                                             ISAIAH 59: 14, 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one very remarkable class of laws yet to be considered.\r\n\r\nSo full of cruelty and of unmerciful severity is the slave-code,—such an\r\natrocity is the institution of which it is the legal definition,—that\r\nthere are multitudes of individuals too generous and too just to be\r\nwilling to go to the full extent of its restrictions and deprivations.\r\n\r\nA generous man, instead of regarding the poor slave as a piece of\r\nproperty, dead, and void of rights, is tempted to regard him rather as a\r\nhelpless younger brother, or as a defenceless child, and to extend to\r\nhim, by his own good right arm, that protection and those rights which\r\nthe law denies him. A religious man, who, by the theory of his belief,\r\nregards all men as brothers, and considers his Christian slave, with\r\nhimself, as a member of Jesus Christ,—as of one body, one spirit, and\r\ncalled in one hope of his calling,—cannot willingly see him “doomed to\r\nlive without knowledge,” without the power of reading the written Word,\r\nand to raise up his children after him in the same darkness.\r\n\r\nHence, if left to itself, individual humanity would, in many cases,\r\npractically abrogate the slave-code. Individual humanity would teach the\r\nslave to read and write,—would build school-houses for his children, and\r\nwould, in very, very many cases, enfranchise him.\r\n\r\nThe result of all this has been foreseen. It has been foreseen that the\r\nresult of education would be general intelligence; that the result of\r\nintelligence would be a knowledge of personal rights; and that an\r\ninquiry into the doctrine of personal rights would be fatal to the\r\nsystem. It has been foreseen, also, that the example of\r\ndisinterestedness and generosity, in emancipation, might carry with it a\r\ngenerous contagion, until it should become universal; that the example\r\nof educated and emancipated slaves would prove a dangerous excitement to\r\nthose still in bondage.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the American slave-code, which, as we have already\r\nseen, embraces, substantially, all the barbarities of that of ancient\r\nRome, has had added to it a set of laws more cruel than any which\r\nancient and heathen Rome ever knew,—laws designed to shut against the\r\nslave his last refuge,—the humanity of his master. The master, in\r\nancient Rome, might give his slave whatever advantages of education he\r\nchose, or at any time emancipate him, and the state did not interfere to\r\nprevent.[16]\r\n\r\nBut in America the laws, throughout all the slave states, most\r\nrigorously forbid, in the first place, the _education_ of the slave. We\r\ndo not profess to give all these laws, but a few striking specimens may\r\nbe presented. Our authority is Judge Stroud’s “Sketch of the Laws of\r\nSlavery.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud’s Sketch, p. 88.]\r\n\r\nThe legislature of South Carolina, in 1740, enounced the following\r\npreamble:—“Whereas, the having of slaves taught to write, or suffering\r\nthem to be employed in writing, may be attended with _great\r\ninconveniences_;” and enacted that the crime of teaching a slave to\r\nwrite, or of employing a slave as a scribe, should be punished by a fine\r\nof _one hundred pounds_, current money. If the reader will turn now to\r\nthe infamous “protective” statute, enacted by the same legislature, in\r\nthe same year, he will find that the _same penalty_ has been appointed\r\nfor the cutting out of the tongue, putting out of the eye, cruel\r\nscalding, &c., of any slave, as for the offence of teaching him to\r\nwrite! That is to say, that to teach him to write, and to put out his\r\neyes, are to be regarded as equally reprehensible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud’s Sketch, p. 89. 2 Brevard’s Digest, pp. 254–5.]\r\n\r\nThat there might be no doubt of the “great and fundamental policy” of\r\nthe state, and that there might be full security against the “_great\r\ninconveniences_” of “having of slaves taught to write,” it was enacted,\r\nin 1800, “That assemblies of slaves, free negroes, &c., * * * * for the\r\npurpose of _mental instruction_, in a confined or secret place, &c. &c.,\r\nis [are] declared to be an unlawful meeting;” and the officers are\r\nrequired to enter such confined places, and disperse the “unlawful\r\nassemblage,” inflicting, at their discretion, “_such corporal\r\npunishment_, not exceeding twenty lashes, upon such slaves, free\r\nnegroes, &c., as they may judge _necessary for deterring them from the\r\nlike unlawful assemblage in future_.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud, pp. 88, 89.]\r\n\r\nThe statute-book of Virginia is adorned with a law similar to the one\r\nlast quoted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud’s Sketch, pp. 89, 90.]\r\n\r\nThe offence of teaching a slave to write was early punished, in Georgia,\r\nas in South Carolina, by a pecuniary fine. But the city of Savannah\r\nseems to have found this penalty insufficient to protect it from “_great\r\ninconveniences_,” and we learn, by a quotation in the work of Judge\r\nStroud from a number of “The Portfolio,” that “the city has passed an\r\nordinance, by which any person that teaches any person of color, _slave\r\nor free_, to _read or write_, or causes such person to be so taught, is\r\nsubjected to a fine of thirty dollars for _each_ offence; and every\r\nperson of color who shall keep a school, to teach reading or writing, is\r\nsubject to a fine of thirty dollars, or to be imprisoned ten days, and\r\nwhipped thirty-nine lashes.”\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ In regard to religious privileges:\r\n\r\nThe State of Georgia has enacted a law, “To _protect_ religious\r\nsocieties in the exercise of their religious duties.” This law, after\r\nappointing rigorous penalties for the offence of interrupting or\r\ndisturbing a congregation of _white persons_, concludes in the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud, p. 92. Prince’s Digest, p. 342.]\r\n\r\n  No congregation, or company of _negroes_, shall, under _pretence of\r\n  divine worship_, assemble themselves, contrary to the act regulating\r\n  patrols.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud, p. 93. Prince’s Digest, p. 447.]\r\n\r\n“The act regulating patrols,” as quoted by the editor of Prince’s\r\nDigest, empowers _every justice of the peace to disperse_ ANY _assembly\r\nor meeting of slaves_ which _may_ disturb the peace, &c., of his\r\nmajesty’s subjects, and permits that every slave found at such a meeting\r\nshall “_immediately_ be corrected, WITHOUT TRIAL, _by receiving on the\r\nbare back twenty-five stripes with a whip, switch, or cowskin_.”\r\n\r\nThe history of legislation in South Carolina is significant. An act was\r\npassed in 1800, containing the following section:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud, p. 93. 2 Brevard’s Dig. 254, 255.]\r\n\r\n  It shall not be lawful for any number of slaves, free negroes,\r\n  mulattoes or mestizoes, even in company with white persons, to meet\r\n  together and assemble for the purpose of mental instruction _or\r\n  religious worship_, either before the rising of the sun, or after\r\n  the going down of the same. And all magistrates, sheriffs, militia\r\n  officers, &c. &c., are hereby vested with power, &c., for dispersing\r\n  such assemblies, &c.\r\n\r\nThe law just quoted seems somehow to have had a prejudicial effect upon\r\nthe religious interests of the “slaves, free negroes,” &c., specified in\r\nit; for, three years afterwards, on the petition of certain religious\r\nsocieties, a “_protective act_” was passed, which should secure them\r\nthis _great religious privilege_; to wit, that it should be unlawful,\r\nbefore nine o’clock, “to break into a place of meeting, wherein shall be\r\nassembled the members of any religious society of this state, _provided\r\na majority of them shall be white persons_, or otherwise to disturb\r\ntheir devotion, _unless_ such person shall have first obtained * * * * a\r\nwarrant, &c.”\r\n\r\n_Thirdly._ It appears that many masters, who are disposed to treat their\r\nslaves generously, have allowed them to accumulate property, to raise\r\ndomestic animals for their own use, and, in the case of intelligent\r\nservants, to go at large, to hire their own time, and to trade upon\r\ntheir own account. Upon all these practices the law comes down, with\r\nunmerciful severity. A penalty is inflicted on the owner, but, with a\r\nrigor quite accordant with the tenor of slave-law the offence is\r\nconsidered, in law, as that of the slave, rather than that of the\r\nmaster; so that, if the master is generous enough not to regard the\r\npenalty which is imposed upon himself, he may be restrained by the fear\r\nof bringing a greater evil upon his dependent. These laws are, in some\r\ncases, so constructed as to make it for the interest of the lowest and\r\nmost brutal part of society that they be enforced, by offering half the\r\nprofits to the informer. We give the following, as specimens of slave\r\nlegislation on this subject:\r\n\r\nThe law of South Carolina:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud, pp. 46, 47. James’ Digest, 385, 386. Act of 1740.]\r\n\r\n  It shall not be lawful for any slave to buy, sell, trade, &c., for\r\n  any goods, &c., without a license from the owner, &c.; nor shall any\r\n  slave be permitted to keep any boat, periauger,[17] or canoe, or\r\n  raise and breed, for the benefit of such slave, any horses, mares,\r\n  cattle, sheep, or hogs, under pain of forfeiting all the goods, &c.,\r\n  and all the boats, periaugers, or canoes, horses, mares, cattle,\r\n  sheep or hogs. And it shall be lawful for any person whatsoever to\r\n  seize and take away from any slave all such goods, &c., boats, &c.\r\n  &c., and to deliver the same into the hands of any justice of the\r\n  peace, nearest to the place where the seizure shall be made; and\r\n  such justice shall take the oath of the person making such seizure,\r\n  concerning the manner thereof; and if the said justice shall be\r\n  satisfied that such seizure has been made according to law, he shall\r\n  pronounce and declare the goods so seized to be forfeited, and order\r\n  the same to be sold at public outcry, one half of the moneys arising\r\n  from such sale to go to the state, and the other half to him or them\r\n  that sue for the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2 Cobb’s Dig. 284.]\r\n\r\nThe laws in many other states are similar to the above; but the State of\r\nGeorgia has an additional provision, against permitting the slave to\r\nhire himself to another for his own benefit; a penalty of thirty dollars\r\nis imposed for every weekly offence, on the part of the master, unless\r\nthe labor be done on his own premises. Savannah, Augusta, and Sunbury,\r\nare places excepted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud, p. 47]\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, “if the master shall permit his slave to hire himself out,”\r\nthe _slave_ is to be apprehended, &c., and the _master_ to be fined.\r\n\r\nIn an early act of the legislature of the orthodox and Presbyterian\r\nState of North Carolina, it is gratifying to see how the judicious\r\ncourse of public policy is made to subserve the interests of Christian\r\ncharity,—how, in a single ingenious sentence, provision is made for\r\npunishing the offender against society, rewarding the patriotic\r\ninformer, and feeding the poor and destitute:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud’s Sketch, p. 47.]\r\n\r\n  All horses, cattle, hogs or sheep, that, one month after the passing\r\n  of this act, shall belong to any slave, or be of any slave’s mark,\r\n  in this state, shall be seized and sold by the county wardens, and\r\n  by them applied, the one-half to the support of the poor of the\r\n  county, and the other half to the informer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud, p. 48.]\r\n\r\nIn Mississippi a fine of fifty dollars is imposed upon the master who\r\npermits his slave to cultivate cotton for his own use; or who licenses\r\nhis slave to go at large and trade as a freeman; or who is _convicted_\r\nof permitting his slave to keep “_stock of any description_.”\r\n\r\nTo show how the above law has been interpreted by the highest judicial\r\ntribunal of the sovereign State of Mississippi, we repeat here a portion\r\nof a decision of Chief Justice Sharkey, which we have elsewhere given\r\nmore in full.\r\n\r\n  Independent of the principles laid down in adjudicated cases, our\r\n  statute-law prohibits slaves from owning certain kinds of property;\r\n  and it may be inferred that the legislature supposed they were\r\n  extending the act as far as it could be necessary to exclude them\r\n  from owning _any_ property, as the prohibition includes that kind of\r\n  property which they would most likely be permitted to own without\r\n  interruption, to wit: hogs, horses, cattle, &c. They cannot be\r\n  prohibited from holding such property in consequence of its being of\r\n  a dangerous or offensive character, but because _it was deemed\r\n  impolitic for them to hold property of any description_.\r\n\r\nIt was asserted, at the beginning of this head, that the permission of\r\nthe master to a slave to hire his own time is, by law, considered the\r\noffence of the slave; the slave being subject to prosecution therefor,\r\nnot the master. This is evident from the tenor of some of the laws\r\nquoted and alluded to above. It will be still further illustrated by the\r\nfollowing decisions of the courts of North Carolina. They are copied\r\nfrom the Supplement to the U. S. Digest, vol. II. p. 798:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The State _v._ Clarissa. 5 Iredell, 221.]\r\n\r\n  139. An indictment charging that a certain negro did hire her own\r\n  time, contrary to the form of the statute, &c., is defective and\r\n  must be quashed, because it was omitted to be charged that _she was\r\n  permitted by her master to go at large, which is one essential part\r\n  of the offence_.\r\n\r\n  140. Under the first clause of the thirty-first section of the 111th\r\n  chapter of the Revised Statutes, prohibiting masters from hiring to\r\n  slaves their own time, the master is not _indictable_; he is only\r\n  subject to a penalty of forty dollars. Nor is the master indictable\r\n  under the second clause of that section; the process being _against\r\n  the slave_, not against the master.—Ib.\r\n\r\n  142. To constitute the offence under section 32 (Rev. Stat. c. cxi.\r\n  § 32) it is not necessary that the slave should have hired his time;\r\n  it is sufficient if the master permits him to go at large as a\r\n  freeman.\r\n\r\nThis is maintaining the ground that “_the master can do no wrong_” with\r\ngreat consistency and thoroughness. But it is in perfect keeping, both\r\nin form and spirit, with the whole course of slave-law, which always\r\nupholds the supremacy of the master, and always depresses the slave.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly._ Stringent laws against emancipation exist in nearly all the\r\nslave states.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud, 147. Prince’s Dig. 456. James’ Dig. 398. Toulmin’s\r\n           Dig. 632. Miss. Rev. Code, 386.]\r\n\r\nIn four of the states,—South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and\r\nMississippi,—emancipation cannot be effected, except by a special act of\r\nthe legislature of the state.\r\n\r\nIn Georgia, the _offence_ of setting free “any slave, or slaves, in any\r\nother manner and form than the one prescribed,” was punishable,\r\naccording to the law of 1801, by the forfeiture of two hundred dollars,\r\nto be recovered by action _or indictment_; the slaves in question still\r\nremaining, “_to all intents and purposes, as much in a state of slavery\r\nas before they were manumitted_.”\r\n\r\nBelievers in human progress will be interested to know that since the\r\nlaw of 1801 there has been a reform introduced into this part of the\r\nlegislation of the republic of Georgia. In 1818, a new law was passed,\r\nwhich, as will be seen, contains a grand remedy for the abuses of the\r\nold. In this it is provided, with endless variety of specifications and\r\nsynonyms, as if to “let suspicion double-lock the door” against any\r\npossible evasion, that, “All and every will, testament and deed, whether\r\nby way of trust or otherwise, contract, or agreement, or stipulation, or\r\nother instrument in writing or by parol, made and executed for the\r\npurpose of effecting, or endeavoring to effect, the manumission of any\r\nslave or slaves, either directly ... or indirectly, or virtually, &c.\r\n&c., shall be, and the same are hereby, declared to be utterly null and\r\nvoid.” And the guilty author of the outrage against the peace of the\r\nstate, contemplated in such deed, &c. &c., “and all and every person or\r\npersons concerned in giving or attempting to give effect thereto, ... in\r\nany way or manner whatsoever, shall be severally liable to a penalty not\r\nexceeding one thousand dollars.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud’s Sketch, pp. 147–8. Prince’s Dig. 466.]\r\n\r\nIt would be quite anomalous in slave-law, and contrary to the “great and\r\nfundamental policy” of slave states, if the negroes who, not having the\r\nfear of God before their eyes, but being instigated by the devil, should\r\nbe guilty of being thus manumitted, were suffered to go unpunished;\r\naccordingly, the law very properly and judiciously provides that “each\r\nand every slave or slaves in whose behalf such will or testament, &c.\r\n&c. &c., shall have been made, shall be liable to be _arrested_ by\r\nwarrant, &c.; and, _being thereof convicted_, &c., shall be liable to be\r\nsold as a slave or slaves by public outcry; and the proceeds of such\r\nslaves shall be appropriated, &c. &c.”\r\n\r\nJudge Stroud gives the following account of the law of Mississippi:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud’s Sketch, 149. Miss. Rev. Code, 385–6 (Act June 18,\r\n           1822).]\r\n\r\n  The emancipation must be by an _instrument in writing_, a last will\r\n  or deed &c., _under seal_, attested by at least _two credible\r\n  witnesses_, or _acknowledged in the court_ of the county or\r\n  corporation where the emancipator resides; _proof satisfactory to\r\n  the General Assembly_ must be adduced that the slave has done _some\r\n  meritorious act for the benefit of his master_, or rendered _some\r\n  distinguished service to the state_; all which circumstances are but\r\n  _pre-requisites_, and are of no efficacy until a special _act of\r\n  assembly_ sanctions the emancipation; to which may be added, as has\r\n  been already stated, a saving of the _rights of creditors_, and the\r\n  protection of _the widow’s thirds_.\r\n\r\nThe same _pre-requisite_ of “_meritorious services_, to be adjudged of\r\nand allowed by the county court,” is exacted by an act of the General\r\nAssembly of North Carolina; and all slaves emancipated contrary to the\r\nprovisions of this act are to be committed to the jail of the county,\r\nand at the next court held for that county are to be sold to the highest\r\nbidder.\r\n\r\nBut the law of North Carolina does not refuse opportunity for\r\nrepentance, even after the crime has been proved: accordingly,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud’s Sketch, 148. Haywood’s Manual, 525, 526, 529,\r\n           537.]\r\n\r\n  The sheriff is directed, five days before the time for the sale of\r\n  the _emancipated_ negro, to give notice, in writing, to the person\r\n  by whom the emancipation was made, to the end,\r\n\r\nand with the hope that, smitten by remorse of conscience, and brought to\r\na sense of his guilt before God and man,\r\n\r\n  such person may, if he thinks proper, renew his claim to the negro\r\n  so emancipated by him; on failure to do which, the sale is to be\r\n  made by the sheriff, and one-fifth part of the net proceeds is to\r\n  become the property of the freeholder by whom the apprehension was\r\n  made, and the remaining four-fifths are to be paid into the public\r\n  treasury.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stroud, pp. 148–154.]\r\n\r\nIt is proper to add that we have given examples of the laws of states\r\nwhose legislation on this subject has been most severe. The laws of\r\nVirginia, Maryland, Missouri, Kentucky and Louisiana, are much less\r\nstringent.\r\n\r\nA striking case, which shows how inexorably the law contends with the\r\nkind designs of the master, is on record in the reports of legal\r\ndecisions in the State of Mississippi. The circumstances of the case\r\nhave been thus briefly stated in the _New York Evening Post_, edited by\r\nMr. William Cullen Bryant. They are a romance of themselves.\r\n\r\n  A man of the name of Elisha Brazealle, a planter in Jefferson\r\n  County, Mississippi, was attacked with a loathsome disease. During\r\n  his illness he was faithfully nursed by a mulatto slave, to whose\r\n  assiduous attentions he felt that he owed his life. He was duly\r\n  impressed by her devotion, and soon after his recovery took her to\r\n  Ohio, and had her educated. She was very intelligent, and improved\r\n  her advantages so rapidly that when he visited her again he\r\n  determined to marry her. He executed a deed for her emancipation,\r\n  and had it recorded both in the States of Ohio and Mississippi, and\r\n  made her his wife.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Brazealle returned with her to Mississippi, and in process of\r\n  time had a son. After a few years he sickened and died, leaving a\r\n  will, in which, after reciting the deed of emancipation, he declared\r\n  his intention to ratify it, and devised all his property to this\r\n  lad, acknowledging him in the will to be such.\r\n\r\n  Some poor and distant relations in North Carolina, whom he did not\r\n  know, and for whom he did not care, hearing of his death, came on to\r\n  Mississippi, and claimed the property thus devised. They instituted\r\n  a suit for its recovery, and the case (it is reported in Howard’s\r\n  Mississippi Reports, vol. II., p. 837) came before Judge Sharkey,\r\n  our new consul at Havana. He decided it, and in that decision\r\n  declared the act of emancipation _an offence against morality_, and\r\n  pernicious and detestable as an example. He set _aside the will,\r\n  gave the property of Brazealle to his distant relations, condemned\r\n  Brazealle’s son, and his wife, that_ son’s mother, again to bondage,\r\n  and made them the slaves of these North Carolina kinsmen, as part of\r\n  the assets of the estate.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Sharkey, after narrating the circumstances of the case,\r\ndeclares the validity of the deed of emancipation to be the main\r\nquestion in the controversy. He then argues that, although according to\r\nprinciples of national comity “contracts are to be construed according\r\nto the laws of the country or state where they are made,” yet these\r\nprinciples are not to be followed when they lead to conclusions in\r\nconflict with “the great and fundamental policy of the state.” What this\r\n“great and fundamental policy” is, in Mississippi, may be gathered from\r\nthe remainder of the decision, which we give in full.\r\n\r\n  Let us apply these principles to the deed of emancipation. To give\r\n  it validity would be, in the first place, a violation of the\r\n  declared policy, and contrary to a positive law of the state.\r\n\r\n  The policy of a state is indicated by the general course of\r\n  legislation on a given subject; and we find that free negroes are\r\n  deemed offensive, because they are not permitted to emigrate to or\r\n  remain in the state. They are allowed few privileges, and subject to\r\n  heavy penalties for offences. They are required to leave the state\r\n  within thirty days after notice, and in the mean time give security\r\n  for good behavior; and those of them who can lawfully remain must\r\n  register and carry with them their certificates, or they may be\r\n  committed to jail. It would also violate a positive law, passed by\r\n  the legislature, expressly to maintain this settled policy, and to\r\n  prevent emancipation. No owner can emancipate his slave, but by a\r\n  deed or will properly attested, or acknowledged in court, and proof\r\n  to the legislature that such slave has performed some meritorious\r\n  act for the benefit of the master, or some distinguished service for\r\n  the state; and the deed or will can have no validity until ratified\r\n  by special act of legislature. It is believed that this law and\r\n  policy are too essentially important to the interests of our\r\n  citizens to permit them to be evaded.\r\n\r\n  The state of the case shows conclusively that the contract had its\r\n  origin in an offence against morality, pernicious and detestable as\r\n  an example. But, above all, it seems to have been planned and\r\n  executed with a fixed design to evade the rigor of the laws of this\r\n  state. The acts of the party in going to Ohio with the slaves, and\r\n  there executing the deed, and his immediate return with them to this\r\n  state, point with unerring certainty to his purpose and object. The\r\n  laws of this state cannot be thus defrauded of their operation by\r\n  one of our own citizens. If we could have any doubts about the\r\n  principle, the case reported in 1 Randolph, 15, would remove them.\r\n\r\n  As we think the validity of the deed must depend upon the laws of\r\n  this state, it becomes unnecessary to inquire whether it could have\r\n  any force by the laws of Ohio. If it were even valid there, it can\r\n  have no force here. The consequence is, that the negroes, John\r\n  Monroe and his mother, are still slaves, and a part of the estate of\r\n  Elisha Brazealle. They have not acquired a right to their freedom\r\n  under the will; for, even if the clause in the will were sufficient\r\n  for that purpose, their emancipation has not been consummated by an\r\n  act of the legislature.\r\n\r\n  John Monroe, being a slave, cannot take the property as devisee; and\r\n  I apprehend it is equally clear that it cannot be held in trust for\r\n  him. 4 Desans. Rep. 266. Independent of the principles laid down in\r\n  adjudicated cases, our statute law prohibits slaves from owning\r\n  certain kinds of property; and it may be inferred that the\r\n  legislature supposed they were extending the act as far as it could\r\n  be necessary to exclude them from owning any property, as the\r\n  prohibition includes that kind of property which they would most\r\n  likely be permitted to own without interruption, to wit, hogs,\r\n  horses, cattle, &c. They cannot be prohibited from holding such\r\n  property in consequence of its being of a dangerous or offensive\r\n  character, but because it was deemed impolitic for them to hold\r\n  property of any description. It follows, therefore, that his heirs\r\n  are entitled to the property.\r\n\r\n  As the deed was void, and the devisee could not take under the will,\r\n  the heirs might, perhaps, have had a remedy at law; but, as an\r\n  account must be taken for the rents and profits, and for the final\r\n  settlement of the estate, I see no good reason why they should be\r\n  sent back to law. The remedy is, doubtless, more full and complete\r\n  than it could be at law. The decree of the chancellor overruling the\r\n  demurrer must be affirmed, and the cause remanded for further\r\n  proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice Sharkey who pronounced this decision is stated by the\r\n_Evening Post_ to have been a principal agent in the passage of the\r\nsevere law under which this horrible inhumanity was perpetrated.\r\n\r\nNothing more forcibly shows the absolute despotism of the slave-law over\r\nall the kindest feelings and intentions of the master, and the\r\ndetermination of courts to carry these severities to their full lengths,\r\nthan this cruel deed, which precipitated a young man who had been\r\neducated to consider himself free, and his mother, an educated woman,\r\nback into the bottomless abyss of slavery. Had this case been chosen for\r\nthe theme of a novel, or a tragedy, the world would have cried out upon\r\nit as a plot of monstrous improbability. As it stands in the law-book,\r\nit is only a specimen of that awful kind of truth, stranger than\r\nfiction, which is all the time evolving, in one form or another, from\r\nthe workings of this anomalous system.\r\n\r\nThis view of the subject is a very important one, and ought to be\r\nearnestly and gravely pondered by those in foreign countries, who are\r\ntoo apt to fasten their condemnation and opprobrium rather on the\r\n_person_ of the slave-holder than on the horrors of the legal system. In\r\nsome slave states it seems as if there was very little that the\r\nbenevolent owner could do which should permanently benefit his slave,\r\nunless he should seek to _alter the laws_. Here it is that the highest\r\nobligation of the Southern Christian lies. Nor will the world or God\r\nhold _them_ guiltless who, with the elective franchise in their hands,\r\nand the full power to speak, write and discuss, suffer this monstrous\r\nsystem of legalized cruelty to go on from age to age.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  In and after the reign of Augustus, certain restrictive regulations\r\n  were passed, designed to prevent an increase of unworthy citizens by\r\n  emancipation. They had, however, nothing like the stringent force of\r\n  American laws.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  _i. e._ Periagua.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n       THE HEBREW SLAVE-LAW COMPARED WITH THE AMERICAN SLAVE-LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving compared the American law with the Roman, we will now compare it\r\nwith one other code of slave-laws, to wit, the Hebrew.\r\n\r\nThis comparison is the more important, because American slavery has been\r\ndefended on the ground of God’s permitting Hebrew slavery.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry now arises, What kind of slavery was it that was permitted\r\namong the Hebrews? for in different nations very different systems have\r\nbeen called by the general name of slavery.\r\n\r\nThat the patriarchal state of servitude which existed in the time of\r\nAbraham was a very different thing from American slavery, a few graphic\r\nincidents in the scripture narrative show; for we read that when the\r\nangels came to visit Abraham, although he had three hundred servants\r\nborn in his house, it is said that _Abraham_ hasted, and took a calf,\r\nand killed it, and gave it to a young man to dress; and that he told\r\n_Sarah_ to take three measures of meal and knead it into cakes; and\r\nthat, when all was done, he himself set it before his guests.\r\n\r\nFrom various other incidents which appear in the patriarchal narrative,\r\nit would seem that these servants bore more the relation of the members\r\nof a Scotch clan to their feudal lord than that of an American slave to\r\nhis master;—thus it seems that if Abraham had died without children, his\r\nhead servant would have been his heir.—Gen. 15:3.\r\n\r\nOf what species, then, was the slavery which God permitted among the\r\nHebrews? By what laws was it regulated?\r\n\r\nIn the New Testament the whole Hebrew system of administration is spoken\r\nof as a relatively imperfect one, and as superseded by the Christian\r\ndispensation.—Heb. 8:13.\r\n\r\nWe are taught thus to regard the Hebrew system as an educational system,\r\nby which a debased, half-civilized race, which had been degraded by\r\nslavery in its worst form among the Egyptians, was gradually elevated to\r\nrefinement and humanity.\r\n\r\nAs they went from the land of Egypt, it would appear that the most\r\ndisgusting personal habits, the most unheard-of and unnatural\r\nimpurities, prevailed among them; so that it was necessary to make laws\r\nwith relation to things of which Christianity has banished the very name\r\nfrom the earth.\r\n\r\nBeside all this, polygamy, war and slavery, were the universal custom of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nIt is represented in the New Testament that God, in educating this\r\npeople, proceeded in the same gradual manner in which a wise father\r\nwould proceed with a family of children.\r\n\r\nHe selected a few of the most vital points of evil practice, and forbade\r\nthem by positive statute, under rigorous penalties.\r\n\r\nThe worship of any other god was, by the Jewish law, constituted high\r\ntreason, and rigorously punished with death.\r\n\r\nAs the knowledge of the true God and religious instruction could not\r\nthen, as now, be afforded by printing and books, one day in the week had\r\nto be set apart for preserving in the minds of the people a sense of His\r\nbeing, and their obligations to Him. The devoting of this day to any\r\nother purpose was also punished with death; and the reason is obvious,\r\nthat its sacredness was the principal means relied on for preserving the\r\nallegiance of the nation to their king and God, and its desecration, of\r\ncourse, led directly to high treason against the head of the state.\r\n\r\nWith regard to many other practices which prevailed among the Jews, as\r\namong other heathen nations, we find the Divine Being taking the same\r\ncourse which wise human legislators have taken.\r\n\r\nWhen Lycurgus wished to banish money and its attendant luxuries from\r\nSparta, he did not forbid it by direct statute-law, but he instituted a\r\ncurrency so clumsy and uncomfortable that, as we are informed by Rollin,\r\nit took a cart and pair of oxen to carry home the price of a very\r\nmoderate estate.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner the Divine Being surrounded the customs of polygamy,\r\nwar, blood-revenge and slavery, with regulations which gradually and\r\ncertainly tended to abolish them entirely.\r\n\r\nNo one would pretend that the laws which God established in relation to\r\npolygamy, cities of refuge, &c., have any application to Christian\r\nnations now.\r\n\r\nThe following summary of some of these laws of the Mosaic code is given\r\nby Dr. C. E. Stowe, Professor of Biblical Literature in Andover\r\nTheological Seminary:\r\n\r\n  1. It commanded a Hebrew, even though a married man, with wife and\r\n  children living, to take the childless widow of a deceased brother,\r\n  and beget children with her.—Deut. 25:5–10.\r\n\r\n  2. The Hebrews, under certain restrictions, were allowed to make\r\n  concubines, or wives for a limited time, of women taken in\r\n  war.—Deut. 21:10–19.\r\n\r\n  3. A Hebrew who already had a wife was allowed to take another also,\r\n  provided he still continued his intercourse with the first as her\r\n  husband, and treated her kindly and affectionately.—Exodus 21:9–11.\r\n\r\n  4. By the Mosaic law, the nearest relative of a murdered Hebrew\r\n  could pursue and slay the murderer, unless he could escape to the\r\n  city of refuge; and the same permission was given in case of\r\n  accidental homicide.—Num. 35:9–39.\r\n\r\n  5. The Israelites were commanded to exterminate the Canaanites, men,\r\n  women and children.—Deut. 9:12; 20:16–18.\r\n\r\n  Any one, or all, of the above practices, can be justified by the\r\n  Mosaic law, as well as the practice of slave-holding.\r\n\r\n  Each of these laws, although in its time it was an ameliorating law,\r\n  designed to take the place of some barbarous abuse, and to be a\r\n  connecting link by which some higher state of society might be\r\n  introduced, belongs confessedly to that system which St. Paul says\r\n  made nothing perfect. They are a part of the commandment which he\r\n  says was annulled for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof, and\r\n  which, in the time which he wrote, was waxing old, and ready to\r\n  vanish away. And Christ himself says, with regard to certain\r\n  permissions of this system, that they were given on account of the\r\n  “hardness of their hearts,”—because the attempt to enforce a more\r\n  stringent system at that time, owing to human depravity, would have\r\n  only produced greater abuses.\r\n\r\nThe following view of the Hebrew laws of slavery is compiled from\r\nBarnes’ work on slavery, and from Professor Stowe’s manuscript lectures.\r\n\r\nThe legislation commenced by making the great and common source of\r\nslavery—kidnapping—a capital crime.\r\n\r\nThe enactment is as follows: “He that stealeth a man and selleth him, or\r\nif he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.”—Exodus\r\n21:16.\r\n\r\nThe sources from which slaves were to be obtained were thus reduced to\r\ntwo: first, the voluntary sale of an individual by himself, which\r\ncertainly does not come under the designation of involuntary servitude;\r\nsecond, the appropriation of captives taken in war, and the buying from\r\nthe heathen.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the servitude of the Hebrew by a voluntary sale of\r\nhimself, such servitude, by the statute-law of the land, came to an end\r\nonce in seven years; so that the worst that could be made of it was that\r\nit was a voluntary contract to labor for a certain time.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the servants bought of the heathen, or of foreigners in\r\nthe land, there was a statute by which their servitude was annulled once\r\nin fifty years.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed, from a disconnected view of one particular passage\r\nin the Mosaic code, that God directly countenanced the treating of a\r\nslave, who was a stranger and foreigner, with more rigor and severity\r\nthan a Hebrew slave. That this was not the case will appear from the\r\nfollowing enactments, which have express reference to strangers:\r\n\r\n  The stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born\r\n  among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself.—Lev. 19:34.\r\n\r\n  Thou shalt neither vex a stranger nor oppress him; for ye were\r\n  strangers in the land of Egypt.—Exodus 22:21.\r\n\r\n  Thou shalt not oppress a stranger, for ye know the heart of a\r\n  stranger.—Exodus 23:9.\r\n\r\n  The Lord your God regardeth not persons. He doth execute the\r\n  judgment of the fatherless and the widow, and loveth the stranger in\r\n  giving him food and raiment; love ye therefore the stranger.—Deut.\r\n  10:17–19.\r\n\r\n  Judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the\r\n  stranger that is with him.—Deut. 1:16.\r\n\r\n  Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger.—Deut.\r\n  27:19.\r\n\r\nInstead of making slavery an oppressive institution with regard to the\r\nstranger, it was made by God a system within which heathen were adopted\r\ninto the Jewish state, educated and instructed in the worship of the\r\ntrue God, and in due time emancipated.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they were protected by law from personal violence.\r\nThe loss of an eye or a tooth, through the violence of his master, took\r\nthe slave out of that master’s power entirely, and gave him his liberty.\r\nThen, further than this, if a master’s conduct towards a slave was such\r\nas to induce him to run away, it was enjoined that nobody should assist\r\nin retaking him, and that he should dwell wherever he chose in the land,\r\nwithout molestation. Third, the law secured to the slave a very\r\nconsiderable portion of time, which was to be at his own disposal. Every\r\nseventh year was to be at his own disposal.—Lev. 25:4–6. Every seventh\r\nday was, of course, secured to him.—Ex. 20:10.\r\n\r\nThe servant had the privilege of attending the three great national\r\nfestivals, when all the males of the nation were required to appear\r\nbefore God in Jerusalem.—Ex. 34:23.\r\n\r\nEach of these festivals, it is computed, took up about three weeks.\r\n\r\nThe slave also was to be a guest in the family festivals. In Deut.\r\n12:12, it is said, “Ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God, ye, and\r\nyour sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your\r\nmaid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates.”\r\n\r\nDr. Barnes estimates that the whole amount of time which a servant could\r\nhave to himself would amount to about twenty-three years out of fifty,\r\nor nearly one-half his time.\r\n\r\nAgain, the servant was placed on an exact equality with his master in\r\nall that concerned his religious relations.\r\n\r\nNow, if we recollect that in the time of Moses the God and the king of\r\nthe nation were one and the same person, and that the civil and\r\nreligious relation were one and the same, it will appear that the slave\r\nand his master stood on an equality in their civil relation with regard\r\nto the state.\r\n\r\nThus, in Deuteronomy 29, is described a solemn national convocation,\r\nwhich took place before the death of Moses, when the whole nation were\r\ncalled upon, after a solemn review of their national history, to renew\r\ntheir constitutional oath of allegiance to their supreme Magistrate and\r\nLord.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Moses addressed them thus:—“Ye stand this day, all of\r\nyou, before the Lord your God; your captains of your tribes, your\r\nelders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel, your little ones,\r\nyour wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, _from the hewer of thy\r\nwood unto the drawer of thy water_; that _thou_ shouldest enter into\r\ncovenant with the Lord thy God, and into his oath, which the Lord thy\r\nGod maketh with thee this day.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wheeler’s Law of Slavery, p. 243.]\r\n\r\nHow different is this from the cool and explicit declaration of South\r\nCarolina with regard to the position of the American slave:—“A slave is\r\nnot generally regarded as legally _capable of being within the peace of\r\nthe state_. He is not a citizen, and is not in that character entitled\r\nto her protection.”\r\n\r\nIn all the religious services, which, as we have seen by the\r\nconstitution of the nation, were civil services, the slave and the\r\nmaster mingled on terms of strict equality. There was none of the\r\ndistinction which appertains to a distinct class or caste. “There was no\r\nspecial service appointed for them at unusual seasons. There were no\r\nparticular seats assigned to them, to keep up the idea that they were a\r\ndegraded class. There was no withholding from them the instruction which\r\nthe word of God gave about the equal rights of mankind.”\r\n\r\n_Fifthly._ It was always contemplated that the slave would, as a matter\r\nof course, choose the Jewish religion, and the service of God, and enter\r\nwillingly into all the obligations and services of the Jewish polity.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnes cites the words of Maimonides, to show how this was commonly\r\nunderstood by the Hebrews.—_Inquiry into the Scriptural Views of\r\nSlavery._ By Albert Barnes, p. 132.\r\n\r\n  Whether a servant be born in the power of an Israelite, or whether\r\n  he be purchased from the heathen, the master is to bring them both\r\n  into the covenant.\r\n\r\n  But he that is in the _house_ is entered on the eighth day; and he\r\n  that is bought with money, on the day on which his master receives\r\n  him, unless the slave be _unwilling_. For, if the master receive a\r\n  grown slave, and he be _unwilling_, his master is to bear with him,\r\n  to seek to win him over by instruction, and by love and kindness,\r\n  for one year. After which, should he refuse so long, it is forbidden\r\n  to keep him longer than a year. And the master must send him back to\r\n  the strangers from whence he came. For the God of Jacob will not\r\n  accept any other than the worship of a _willing_ heart.—_Maimon._\r\n  _Hilcoth Miloth_, chap. I., sec. 8.\r\n\r\nA sixth fundamental arrangement with regard to the Hebrew slave was that\r\nhe _could never be sold_. Concerning this Mr. Barnes remarks:\r\n\r\n  A man, in certain circumstances, _might be bought_ by a Hebrew; but\r\n  when once bought, that was an end of the matter. There is not the\r\n  slightest evidence that any Hebrew ever sold a slave; and any\r\n  provision contemplating that was unknown to the constitution of the\r\n  Commonwealth. It is said of Abraham that he had “servants bought\r\n  with money;” but there is no record of his having ever sold one, nor\r\n  is there any account of its ever having been done by Isaac or Jacob.\r\n  The only instance of a _sale_ of this kind among the patriarchs is\r\n  that act of the brothers of Joseph, which is held up to so strong\r\n  reprobation, by which they sold him to the Ishmaelites. Permission\r\n  is given in the law of Moses to _buy_ a servant, but none is given\r\n  to _sell_ him again; and the fact that no such permission is given\r\n  is full proof that it was not contemplated. When he entered into\r\n  that relation, it became certain that there could be no change,\r\n  unless it was voluntary on his part (comp. Ex. 21:5,6), or unless\r\n  his master gave him his freedom, until the not distant period fixed\r\n  by law when he could be free. There is no arrangement in the law of\r\n  Moses by which servants were to be taken in payment of their\r\n  master’s debts, by which they were to be given as pledges, by which\r\n  they were to be consigned to the keeping of others, or by which they\r\n  were to be given away as presents. There are no instances occurring\r\n  in the Jewish history in which any of these things were done. This\r\n  law is positive in regard to the Hebrew servant, and the principle\r\n  of the law would apply to all others. Lev. 25:42.—“They shall not be\r\n  sold as bond men.” In all these respects there was a marked\r\n  difference, and there was doubtless intended to be, between the\r\n  estimate affixed to servants and to property.—_Inquiry_, &c., p.\r\n  133–4.\r\n\r\nAs to the practical workings of this system, as they are developed in\r\nthe incidents of sacred history, they are precisely what we should\r\nexpect from such a system of laws. For instance, we find it mentioned\r\nincidentally in the ninth chapter of the first book of Samuel, that when\r\nSaul and his servant came to see Samuel, that Samuel, in anticipation of\r\nhis being crowned king, made a great feast for him; and in verse\r\ntwenty-second the history says: “And Samuel took Saul _and his servant_,\r\nand brought them into the parlor, and made _them_ sit in the chiefest\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\nWe read, also, in 2 Samuel 9:10, of a servant of Saul who had large\r\nestates, and twenty servants of his own.\r\n\r\nWe find, in 1 Chron. 2:34, the following incident related: “Now, Sheshan\r\nhad no sons, but daughters. And Sheshan had a servant, an Egyptian,\r\nwhose name was Jarha. And Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha, his\r\nservant, to wife.”\r\n\r\nDoes this resemble American slavery?\r\n\r\nWe find, moreover, that this connection was not considered at all\r\ndisgraceful, for the son of this very daughter was enrolled among the\r\nvaliant men of David’s army.—1 Chron. 2:41.\r\n\r\nIn fine, we are not surprised to discover that the institutions of Moses\r\nin effect so obliterated all the characteristics of slavery, that it had\r\nceased to exist among the Jews long before the time of Christ. Mr.\r\nBarnes asks:\r\n\r\n  On what evidence would a man rely to prove that slavery existed at\r\n  all in the land in the time of the later prophets of the Maccabees,\r\n  or when the Saviour appeared? There are abundant proofs, as we shall\r\n  see, that it existed in Greece and Rome; but what is the evidence\r\n  that it existed in Judea? So far as I have been able to ascertain,\r\n  there are no declarations that it did to be found in the canonical\r\n  books of the Old Testament, or in Josephus. There are no allusions\r\n  to laws and customs which imply that it was prevalent. There are no\r\n  coins or medals which suppose it. There are no facts which do not\r\n  admit of an easy explanation on the supposition that slavery had\r\n  ceased.—_Inquiry_, &c., p. 226.\r\n\r\nTwo objections have been urged to the interpretations which have been\r\ngiven of two of the enactments before quoted.\r\n\r\n1. It is said that the enactment, “Thou shalt not return to his master\r\nthe servant that has escaped,” &c., relates only to servants escaping\r\nfrom heathen masters to the Jewish nation.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks on this passage are from Prof. Stowe’s lectures:\r\n\r\nDeuteronomy 23:15,16.—These words make a statute which, like every other\r\nstatute, is to be strictly construed. There is nothing in the language\r\nto limit its meaning; there is nothing in the connection in which it\r\nstands to limit its meaning; nor is there anything in the history of the\r\nMosaic legislation to limit the application of this statute to the case\r\nof servants escaping from foreign masters. The assumption that it is\r\nthus limited is wholly gratuitous, and, so far as the Bible is\r\nconcerned, unsustained by any evidence whatever. It is said that it\r\nwould be absurd for Moses to enact such a law while servitude existed\r\namong the Hebrews. It would indeed be absurd, were it the object of the\r\nMosaic legislation to sustain and perpetuate slavery; but, if it were\r\nthe object of Moses to limit and to restrain, and finally to extinguish\r\nslavery, this statute was admirably adapted to his purpose. That it was\r\nthe object of Moses to extinguish, and not to perpetuate, slavery, is\r\nperfectly clear from the whole course of his legislation on the subject.\r\nEvery slave was to have all the religious privileges and instruction to\r\nwhich his master’s children were entitled. Every seventh year released\r\nthe Hebrew slave, and every fiftieth year produced universal\r\nemancipation. If a master, by an accidental or an angry blow, deprived\r\nthe slave of a tooth, the slave, by that act, was forever free. And so,\r\nby the statute in question, if the slave felt himself oppressed, he\r\ncould make his escape, and, though the master was not forbidden to\r\nretake him if he could, every one was forbidden to aid his master in\r\ndoing it. This statute, in fact, made the servitude voluntary, and that\r\nwas what Moses intended.\r\n\r\nMoses dealt with slavery precisely as he dealt with polygamy and with\r\nwar: without directly prohibiting, he so restricted as to destroy it;\r\ninstead of cutting down the poison-tree, he girdled it, and left it to\r\ndie of itself. There is a statute in regard to military expeditions\r\nprecisely analogous to this celebrated fugitive slave law. Had Moses\r\ndesigned to perpetuate a warlike spirit among the Hebrews, the statute\r\nwould have been preëminently absurd; but, if it was his design to crush\r\nit, and to render foreign wars almost impossible, the statute was\r\nexactly adapted to his purpose. It rendered foreign military service, in\r\neffect, entirely voluntary, just as the fugitive law rendered domestic\r\nservitude, in effect, voluntary.\r\n\r\nThe law may be found at length in Deuteronomy 20:5–10; and let it be\r\ncarefully read and compared with the fugitive slave law already adverted\r\nto. Just when the men are drawn up ready for the expedition,—just at the\r\nmoment when even the hearts of brave men are apt to fail them,—the\r\nofficers are commanded to address the soldiers thus:\r\n\r\n  “What man of you is there that hath built a new house, and hath not\r\n  dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the\r\n  battle, and another man dedicate it.\r\n\r\n  “And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard and hath not yet\r\n  eaten of it? Let him also go and return to his house, lest he die in\r\n  the battle, and another man eat of it.\r\n\r\n  “And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not\r\n  taken her? Let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the\r\n  battle, and another man take her.”\r\n\r\n  And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall\r\n  say, “What man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted? Let him\r\n  go and return unto his house, lest his brethren’s heart faint, as\r\n  well as his heart.”\r\n\r\nNow, consider that the Hebrews were exclusively an agricultural people,\r\nthat warlike parties necessarily consist mainly of young men, and that\r\nby this statute every man who had built a house which he had not yet\r\nlived in, and every man who had planted a vineyard from which he had not\r\nyet gathered fruit, and every man who had engaged a wife whom he had not\r\nyet married, and every one who felt timid and faint-hearted, was\r\npermitted and commanded to go home,—how many would there probably be\r\nleft? Especially when the officers, instead of exciting their military\r\nardor by visions of glory and of splendor, were commanded to repeat it\r\nover and over again that they would probably die in the battle and never\r\nget home, and hold this idea up before them as if it were the only idea\r\nsuitable for their purpose, how excessively absurd is the whole statute\r\nconsidered as a military law,—just as absurd as the Mosaic fugitive law,\r\nunderstood in its widest application, is, considered as a slave law!\r\n\r\nIt is clearly the object of this military law to put an end to military\r\nexpeditions; for, with this law in force, such expeditions must always\r\nbe entirely volunteer expeditions. Just as clearly was it the object of\r\nthe fugitive slave law to put an end to compulsory servitude; for, with\r\nthat law in force, the servitude must, in effect, be, to a great extent,\r\nvoluntary,—and that is just what the legislator intended. There is no\r\npossibility of limiting the law, on account of its absurdity, when\r\nunderstood in its widest sense, except by proving that the Mosaic\r\nlegislation was designed to perpetuate and not to limit slavery; and\r\nthis certainly cannot be proved, for it is directly contrary to the\r\nplain matter of fact.\r\n\r\nI repeat it, then, again: there is nothing in the language of this\r\nstatute, there is nothing in the connection in which it stands, there is\r\nnothing in the history of the Mosaic legislation on this subject, to\r\nlimit the application of the law to the case of servants escaping from\r\nforeign masters; but every consideration, from every legitimate source,\r\nleads us to a conclusion directly the opposite. Such a limitation is the\r\narbitrary, unsupported _stet voluntas pro ratione_ assumption of the\r\ncommentator, and nothing else. The only shadow of a philological\r\nargument that I can see, for limiting the statute, is found in the use\r\nof the words _to thee_, in the fifteenth verse. It may be said that the\r\npronoun _thee_ is used in a _national_ and not _individual_ sense,\r\nimplying an escape from some other nation to the Hebrews. But, examine\r\nthe statute immediately preceding this, and observe the use of the\r\npronoun _thee_ in the thirteenth verse. Most obviously, the pronouns in\r\nthese statutes are used with reference to the _individuals_ addressed,\r\nand not in a collective or national sense exclusively; very rarely, if\r\never, can this sense be given to them in the way claimed by the argument\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\n2. It is said that the proclamation, “Thou shalt proclaim liberty\r\nthrough the land to all the inhabitants thereof,” related only to Hebrew\r\nslaves. This assumption is based entirely on the supposition that the\r\nslave was not considered, in Hebrew law, as a person, as an inhabitant\r\nof the land, and a member of the state; but we have just proved that in\r\nthe most solemn transaction of the state the hewer of wood and drawer of\r\nwater is expressly designated as being just as much an actor and\r\nparticipator as his master; and it would be absurd to suppose that, in a\r\nstatute addressed to all the inhabitants of the land, he is not included\r\nas an inhabitant.\r\n\r\nBarnes enforces this idea by some pages of quotations from Jewish\r\nwriters, which will fully satisfy any one who reads his work.\r\n\r\nFrom a review, then, of all that relates to the Hebrew slave-law, it\r\nwill appear that it was a very well-considered and wisely-adapted system\r\nof education and gradual emancipation. No rational man can doubt that if\r\nthe same laws were enacted and the same practices prevailed with regard\r\nto slavery in the United States, that the system of American slavery\r\nmight be considered, to all intents and purposes, practically at an end.\r\nIf there is any doubt of this fact, and it is still thought that the\r\npermission of slavery among the Hebrews justifies American slavery, in\r\nall fairness the experiment of making the two systems alike ought to be\r\ntried, and we should then see what would be the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n                         SLAVERY IS DESPOTISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is always important, in discussing a thing, to keep before our minds\r\nexactly what it is.\r\n\r\nThe only means of understanding precisely what a civil institution is\r\nare an examination of the laws which regulate it. In different ages and\r\nnations, very different things have been called by the name of slavery.\r\nPatriarchal servitude was one thing, Hebrew servitude was another, Greek\r\nand Roman servitude still a third; and these institutions differed very\r\nmuch from each other. What, then, is American slavery, as we have seen\r\nit exhibited by law, and by the decisions of courts?\r\n\r\nLet us begin by stating what it is not.\r\n\r\n1. It is not apprenticeship.\r\n\r\n2. It is not guardianship.\r\n\r\n3. It is in no sense a system for the education of a weaker race by a\r\nstronger.\r\n\r\n4. The happiness of the governed is in no sense its object.\r\n\r\n5. The temporal improvement or the eternal well-being of the governed is\r\nin no sense its object.\r\n\r\nThe object of it has been distinctly stated in one sentence, by Judge\r\nRuffin,—“The end is the profit of the master, his security, and the\r\npublic safety.”\r\n\r\nSlavery, then, is absolute despotism, of the most unmitigated form.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be doing injustice to the absolutism of any\r\n_civilized_ country to liken American slavery to it. The absolute\r\ngovernments of Europe none of them pretend to be founded on a _property_\r\nright of the governor to the persons and entire capabilities of the\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\nThis is a form of despotism which exists only in some of the most savage\r\ncountries of the world; as, for example, in Dahomey.\r\n\r\nThe European absolutism or despotism, now, does, to some extent,\r\nrecognize the happiness and welfare of the _governed_ as the foundation\r\nof government; and the ruler is considered as invested with power _for\r\nthe benefit of the people_; and his right to rule is supposed to be\r\nsomewhat predicated upon the idea that he better understands how to\r\npromote the good of the people than they themselves do. No government in\r\nthe _civilized_ world now presents the pure despotic idea, as it existed\r\nin the old days of the Persian and Assyrian rule.\r\n\r\nThe arguments which defend slavery must be substantially the same as\r\nthose which defend despotism of any other kind; and the objections which\r\nare to be urged against it are precisely those which can be urged\r\nagainst despotism of any other kind. The customs and practices to which\r\nit gives rise are precisely those to which despotisms in all ages have\r\ngiven rise.\r\n\r\nIs the slave suspected of a crime? His master has the power to examine\r\nhim by torture (see State _v._ Castleman). His master has, in fact, in\r\nmost cases, the power of life and death, owing to the exclusion of the\r\nslave’s evidence. He has the power of banishing the slave, at any time,\r\nand without giving an account to anybody, to an exile as dreadful as\r\nthat of Siberia, and to labors as severe as those of the galleys. He has\r\nalso unlimited power over the character of his slave. He can accuse him\r\nof any crime, yet withhold from him all right of trial or investigation,\r\nand sell him into captivity, with his name blackened by an unexamined\r\nimputation.\r\n\r\nThese are all abuses for which despotic governments are blamed. They are\r\npowers which good men who are despotic rulers are beginning to disuse;\r\nbut, under the flag of every slave-holding state, and under the flag of\r\nthe whole United States in the District of Columbia, they are committed\r\nindiscriminately to men of any character.\r\n\r\nBut the worst kind of despotism has been said to be that which extends\r\nalike over the body and over the soul; which can bind the liberty of the\r\nconscience, and deprive a man of all right of choice in respect to the\r\nmanner in which he shall learn the will of God, and worship Him. In\r\nother days, kings on their thrones, and cottagers by their firesides,\r\nalike trembled before a despotism which declared itself able to bind and\r\nto loose, to open and to shut the kingdom of heaven.\r\n\r\nYet this power to control the conscience, to control the religious\r\nprivileges, and all the opportunities which man has of acquaintanceship\r\nwith his Maker, and of learning to do his will, is, under the flag of\r\nevery slave state, and under the flag of the United States, placed in\r\nthe hands of any men, of any character, who can afford to pay for it.\r\n\r\nIt is a most awful and most solemn truth that the greatest republic in\r\nthe world does sustain under her national flag the worst system of\r\ndespotism which can possibly exist.\r\n\r\nWith regard to one point to which we have adverted,—the power of the\r\nmaster to deprive the slave of a legal trial while accusing him of\r\ncrime,—a very striking instance has occurred in the District of\r\nColumbia, within a year or two. The particulars of the case, as stated,\r\nat the time, in several papers, were briefly these: A gentleman in\r\nWashington, our national capital,—an elder in the Presbyterian\r\nchurch,—held a female slave, who had, for some years, supported a good\r\ncharacter in a Baptist church of that city. He accused her of an attempt\r\nto poison his family, and immediately placed her in the hands of a\r\nslave-dealer, who took her over and imprisoned her in the slave-pen at\r\nAlexandria, to await the departure of a coffle. The poor girl had a\r\nmother, who felt as any mother would naturally feel.\r\n\r\nWhen apprized of the situation of her daughter, she flew to the pen,\r\nand, with tears, besought an interview with her only child; but she was\r\ncruelly repulsed, and told to be gone! She then tried to see the elder,\r\nbut failed. She had the promise of money sufficient to purchase her\r\ndaughter, but the owner would listen to no terms of compromise.\r\n\r\nIn her distress, the mother repaired to a lawyer in the city, and begged\r\nhim to give form to her petition in writing. She stated to him what she\r\nwished to have said, and he arranged it for her in such a form as she\r\nherself might have presented it in, had not the benefits of education\r\nbeen denied her. The following is the letter:\r\n\r\n                                          _Washington, July 25, 1851._\r\n\r\n  MR. ——.\r\n\r\n  SIR: I address you as a rich Christian freeman and father, while I\r\n  am myself but a poor slave-mother! I come to plead with you for an\r\n  only child whom I love, who is a professor of the Christian religion\r\n  with yourself, and a member of a Christian church; and who, by your\r\n  act of ownership, now pines in her imprisonment in a loathsome\r\n  man-warehouse, where she is held for sale! I come to plead with you\r\n  for the exercise of that blessed law, “Whatsoever ye would that men\r\n  should do unto you, do ye even so to them.”\r\n\r\n  With great labor, I have found friends who are willing to aid me in\r\n  the purchase of my child, to save us from a cruel separation. You,\r\n  as a _father_, can judge of my feelings when I was told that you had\r\n  decreed her banishment to _distant_ as well as to _hopeless_\r\n  bondage!\r\n\r\n  For nearly six years my child has done for you the hard labor of a\r\n  slave; from the age of sixteen to twenty-two, she has done the hard\r\n  work of your chamber, kitchen, cellar, and stables. By night and by\r\n  day, your will and your commands have been her highest law; and all\r\n  this has been unrequited toil. If in all this time her scanty\r\n  allowance of tea and coffee has been sweetened, it has been at the\r\n  cost of her slave-mother, and not at yours.\r\n\r\n  You are an office-bearer in the church, and a man of _prayer_. As\r\n  such, and as the absolute owner of my child, I ask candidly whether\r\n  she has enjoyed such mild and gentle treatment, and amiable example,\r\n  as she ought to have had, to encourage her in her monotonous\r\n  bondage? Has she received at your hands, in faithful religious\r\n  instruction in the Word of God, a full and fair compensation for all\r\n  her toil? It is not to me alone that you must answer these\r\n  questions. You acknowledge the high authority of His laws who\r\n  preached a deliverance to the captive, and who commands you to give\r\n  to your servant “that which is just and equal.” O! I entreat you,\r\n  withhold not, at this trying hour, from my child that which will cut\r\n  off her last hope, and which may endanger your own soul!\r\n\r\n  It has been said that you charge my daughter with crime. Can this be\r\n  really so? Can it be that you would set aside the obligations of\r\n  honor and good citizenship,—that you would dare to sell the guilty\r\n  one away for money, rather than bring her to trial, which you _know_\r\n  she is ready to meet? What would you say, if you were accused of\r\n  guilt, and refused a trial? Is not her fair name as precious to her,\r\n  in the church to which she belongs, as yours can be to you?\r\n\r\n  Suppose, now, for a moment, that _your_ daughter, whom you love,\r\n  instead of mine, was in these hot days incarcerated in a\r\n  _negro-pen_, subject to my control, fed on the coarsest food,\r\n  committed to the entire will of a brute, denied the privilege\r\n  commonly allowed even to the murderer—that of seeing the face of his\r\n  friends? O! then, you would FEEL! Feel soon, then, for a poor\r\n  slave-mother and her child, and do for us as you shall wish you had\r\n  done when we shall meet before the Great Judge, and when it shall be\r\n  your greatest joy to say, “I _did_ let the oppressed free.”\r\n\r\n                                                          ELLEN BROWN.\r\n\r\nThe girl, however, was sent off to the Southern market.\r\n\r\nThe writer has received these incidents from the gentleman who wrote the\r\nletter. Whether the course pursued by the master was strictly legal is a\r\npoint upon which we are not entirely certain; that it was a course in\r\nwhich the law did not in fact interfere is quite plain, and it is also\r\nvery apparent that it was a course against which public sentiment did\r\nnot remonstrate. The man who exercised this power was a professedly\r\nreligious man, enjoying a position of importance in a Christian church;\r\nand it does not appear, from any movements in the Christian community\r\nabout him, that they did not consider his course a justifiable one.\r\n\r\nYet is not this kind of power the very one at which we are so shocked\r\nwhen we see it exercised by foreign despots?\r\n\r\nDo we not read with shuddering that in Russia, or in Austria, a man\r\naccused of crime is seized upon, separated from his friends, allowed no\r\nopportunities of trial or of self-defence, but hurried off to Siberia,\r\nor some other dreaded exile?\r\n\r\nWhy is despotism any worse in the governor of a state than in a private\r\nindividual?\r\n\r\nThere is a great controversy now going on in the world between the\r\ndespotic and the republican principle. All the common arguments used in\r\nsupport of slavery are arguments that apply with equal strength to\r\ndespotic government, and there are some arguments in favor of despotic\r\ngovernments that do not apply to individual slavery.\r\n\r\nThere are arguments, and quite plausible ones, in favor of despotic\r\ngovernment. Nobody can deny that it possesses a certain kind of\r\nefficiency, compactness, and promptness of movement, which cannot, from\r\nthe nature of things, belong to a republic. Despotism has established\r\nand sustained much more efficient systems of police than ever a republic\r\ndid. The late King of Prussia, by the possession of absolute despotic\r\npower was enabled to carry out a much more efficient system of popular\r\neducation than we ever have succeeded in carrying out in America. He\r\ndistricted his kingdom in the most thorough manner, and obliged every\r\nparent, whether he would or not, to have his children thoroughly\r\neducated.\r\n\r\nIf we reply to all this, as we do, that the possession of absolute power\r\nin a man qualified to use it right is undoubtedly calculated for the\r\ngood of the state, but that there are so few men that know how to use\r\nit, that this form of government is not, on the whole, a safe one, then\r\nwe have stated an argument that goes to overthrow slavery as much as it\r\ndoes a despotic government; for certainly the chances are much greater\r\nof finding one man, in the course of fifty years, who is capable of\r\nwisely using this power, than of finding thousands of men every day in\r\nour streets, who can be trusted with such power. It is a painful and\r\nmost serious fact, that America trusts to the hands of the most brutal\r\nmen of her country, equally with the best, that despotic power which she\r\nthinks an unsafe thing even in the hands of the enlightened, educated\r\nand cultivated Emperor of the Russias.\r\n\r\nWith all our republican prejudices, we cannot deny that Nicholas is a\r\nman of talent, with a mind liberalized by education; we have been\r\ninformed, also, that he is a man of serious and religious character;—he\r\ncertainly, acting as he does in the eye of all the world, must have\r\ngreat restraint upon him from public opinion, and a high sense of\r\ncharacter. But who is the man to whom American laws intrust powers more\r\nabsolute than those of Nicholas of Russia, or Ferdinand of Naples? He\r\nmay have been a pirate on the high seas; he may be a drunkard; he may,\r\nlike Souther, have been convicted of a brutality at which humanity turns\r\npale; but, for all that, American slave-law will none the less trust him\r\nwith this irresponsible power,—power over the body, and power over the\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nOn which side, then, stands the American nation, in the great\r\ncontroversy which is now going on between self-government and despotism?\r\nOn which side does America stand, in the great controversy for liberty\r\nof conscience?\r\n\r\nDo foreign governments exclude their population from the reading of the\r\nBible?—The slave of America is excluded by the most effectual means\r\npossible. Do we say, “Ah! but we read the Bible to our slaves, and\r\npresent the gospel orally?”—This is precisely what religious despotism\r\nin Italy says. Do we say that we have no objection to our slaves reading\r\nthe Bible, if they will stop there; but that with this there will come\r\nin a flood of general intelligence, which will upset the existing state\r\nof things?—This is precisely what is said in Italy.\r\n\r\nDo we say we should be willing that the slave should read his Bible, but\r\nthat he, in his ignorance, will draw false and erroneous conclusions\r\nfrom it, and for that reason we prefer to impart its truths to him\r\norally?—This, also, is precisely what the religious despotism of Europe\r\nsays.\r\n\r\nDo we say, in our vain-glory, that despotic government dreads the coming\r\nin of anything calculated to elevate and educate the people?—And is\r\nthere not the same dread through all the despotic slave governments of\r\nAmerica?\r\n\r\nOn which side, then, does the American nation stand, in the great, last\r\nQUESTION of the age?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PART III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n                 DOES PUBLIC OPINION PROTECT THE SLAVE?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe utter inefficiency of the law to protect the slave in any respect\r\nhas been shown.\r\n\r\nBut it is claimed that, precisely because the law affords the slave no\r\nprotection, therefore public opinion is the more strenuous in his\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\nNothing more frequently strikes the eye, in running over judicial\r\nproceedings in the courts of slave states, than announcements of the\r\nutter inutility of the law to rectify some glaring injustice towards\r\nthis unhappy race, coupled with congratulatory remarks on that\r\nbeneficent state of _public sentiment_ which is to supply entirely this\r\nacknowledged deficiency of the law.\r\n\r\nOn this point it may, perhaps, be sufficient to ask the reader, whether\r\nNorth or South, to review in his own mind the judicial documents which\r\nwe have presented, and ask himself what inference is to be drawn, as to\r\nthe state of public sentiment, from the cases there presented,—from the\r\npleas of lawyers, the decisions of judges, the facts sworn to by\r\nwitnesses, and the general style and spirit of the whole proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn order to appreciate this more fully, let us compare a trial in a free\r\nstate with a trial in a slave state.\r\n\r\nIn the free State of Massachusetts, a man of standing, learning and high\r\nconnections, murdered another man. He did not torture him, but with one\r\nblow sent him in a moment from life. The murderer had every advantage of\r\nposition, of friends; it may be said, indeed, that he had the sympathy\r\nof the whole United States; yet how calmly, with what unmoved and awful\r\ncomposure, did the judicial examination proceed! The murderer was\r\ncondemned to die—what a sensation shook the country! Even sovereign\r\nstates assumed the attitude of petitioners for him.\r\n\r\nThere was a voice of entreaty, from Maine to New Orleans. There were\r\nremonstrances, and there were threats; but still, with what passionless\r\ncalmness retributive justice held on its way! Though the men who were\r\nher instruments were men of merciful and bleeding hearts, yet they bowed\r\nin silence to her sublime will. In spite of all that influence and\r\nwealth and power could do, a cultivated and intelligent man, from the\r\nfirst rank of society, suffered the same penalty that would fall on any\r\nother man who violated the sanctity of human life.\r\n\r\nNow, compare this with a trial in a slave state. In Virginia, Souther\r\nalso murdered a man; but he did not murder him by one merciful blow, but\r\nby twelve hours of torture so horrible that few readers could bear even\r\nthe description of it. It was a mode of death which, to use the language\r\nthat Cicero in his day applied to crucifixion, “ought to be forever\r\nremoved from the sight, hearing, and from the very thoughts of mankind.”\r\nAnd to this horrible scene two white men were WITNESSES!\r\n\r\nObserve the mode in which these two cases were tried, and the general\r\nsensation they produced. Hear the lawyers, in this case of Souther,\r\ncoolly debating whether it can be considered any crime at all. Hear the\r\ndecision of the inferior court, that it is murder in the _second\r\ndegree_, and apportioning as its reward five years of imprisonment. See\r\nthe horrible butcher coming up to the Superior Court in the attitude of\r\nan injured man! See the case recorded as that of _Souther_ VERSUS _The\r\nCommonwealth_, and let us ask any intelligent man, North or South, what\r\nsort of public sentiment does this show!\r\n\r\nDoes it show a belief that the negro is a man? Does it not show\r\ndecidedly that he is _not_ considered as a man? Consider further the\r\nhorrible principle which, reäffirmed in the case, is the law of the land\r\nin Virginia. _It is the policy of the law, in respect to the relation of\r\nmaster and slave, and for the sake of securing proper subordination on\r\nthe part of the slave, to protect the master from prosecution in all\r\nsuch cases, even if the whipping and punishment be malicious, cruel and\r\nexcessive!_\r\n\r\nWhen the most cultivated and intelligent men in the state formally,\r\ncalmly and without any apparent perception of saying anything inhuman,\r\nutter such an astounding decision as this, what _can_ be thought of it?\r\nIf they do not consider this cruel, what is cruel? And, if their\r\nfeelings are so blunted as to see no cruelty in such a decision, what\r\nhope is there of any protection to the slave?\r\n\r\nThis law is a plain and distinct permission to such wretches as Souther\r\nto inflict upon the helpless slave any torture they may choose, without\r\nany accusation or impeachment of crime. It distinctly tells Souther, and\r\nthe white witnesses who saw his deed, and every other low, unprincipled\r\nman in the court, that it is the policy of the law to protect him in\r\nmalicious, cruel and excessive punishments.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of an education is this for the intelligent and cultivated men\r\nof a state to communicate to the lower and less-educated class? Suppose\r\nit to be solemnly announced in Massachusetts, with respect to free\r\nlaborers or apprentices, that it is the policy of the law, for the sake\r\nof producing subordination, to protect the master in inflicting any\r\npunishment, however cruel, malicious and excessive, short of death. We\r\ncannot imagine such a principle declared, without a rebellion and a\r\nstorm of popular excitement to which that of Bunker Hill was calmness\r\nitself;—but, supposing the State of Massachusetts were so “twice dead\r\nand plucked up by the roots” as to allow such a decision to pass without\r\ncomment concerning her working classes,—suppose it did pass, and become\r\nan active, operative reality, what kind of an educational influence\r\nwould it exert upon the commonwealth? What kind of an estimate of the\r\nworking classes would it show in the minds of those who make and execute\r\nthe law?\r\n\r\nWhat an immediate development of villany and brutality would be brought\r\nout by such a law, avowedly made to protect men in cruelty! Cannot men\r\nbe cruel enough, without all the majesty of law being brought into\r\noperation to sanction it, and make it reputable?\r\n\r\nAnd suppose it were said, in vindication of such a law, “O, of course,\r\nno respectable, humane man would ever think of taking advantage of it.”\r\nShould we not think the old State of Massachusetts sunk very low, to\r\nhave on her legal records direct assurances of protection to deeds which\r\nno decent man would ever do?\r\n\r\nAnd, when this shocking permission is brought in review at the\r\njudgment-seat of Christ, and the awful Judge shall say to its makers,\r\naiders, and abettors, Where is thy brother?—when all the souls that have\r\ncalled from under the altar, “How long, O Lord, dost thou not judge and\r\navenge our blood,” shall rise around the judgment-seat as a great cloud\r\nof witnesses, and the judgment is set and the books are opened,—what\r\nanswer will be made for such laws and decisions as these?\r\n\r\nWill they tell the great Judge that it was necessary to preserve the\r\nslave system,—that it could not be preserved without them?\r\n\r\nWill they dare look upon those eyes, which are as a flame of fire, with\r\nany such avowal?\r\n\r\nWill He not answer, as with a voice of thunders, “Ye have killed the\r\npoor and needy, and ye have forgotten that the Lord was his helper”?\r\n\r\nThe deadly sin of slavery is its denial of humanity to man. This has\r\nbeen the sin of oppression, in every age. To tread down, to vilify and\r\ncrush, the image of God, in the person of the poor and lowly, has been\r\nthe great sin of man since the creation of the world. Against this sin\r\nall the prophets of ancient times poured forth their thunders. A still\r\nstronger witness was borne against this sin when God, in Jesus Christ,\r\ntook human nature, and made each human being a brother of the Lord. But\r\nthe last and most sublime witness shall be borne when a MAN shall judge\r\nthe whole earth—a Man who shall acknowledge for His brother the meanest\r\nslave, equally with the proudest master.\r\n\r\nIn most singular and affecting terms it is asserted in the Bible that\r\nthe Father hath committed all judgment to the Son, BECAUSE HE IS THE SON\r\nOF MAN. That human nature, which, in the person of the poor slave, has\r\nbeen despised and rejected, scoffed and scorned, scourged and tortured,\r\nshall in that day be glorified; and it shall appear the most fearful of\r\nsins to have made light of the sacredness of humanity, as these laws and\r\ninstitutions of slavery have done. The fact is, that the whole system of\r\nslave-law, and the whole practice of the slave system, and the public\r\nsentiment that is formed by it, are alike based on the greatest of all\r\nheresies, _a denial of equal human brotherhood_. A whole race has been\r\nthrown out of the range of human existence, their immortality\r\ndisregarded, their dignity as children of God scoffed at, their\r\nbrotherhood with Christ treated as a fable, and all the law and public\r\nsentiment and practice with regard to them such as could be justified\r\nonly on supposition that they were a race of inferior animals.\r\n\r\nIt is because the negro is considered an _inferior animal_, and not\r\nworthy of any better treatment, that the system which relates to him and\r\nthe treatment which falls to him are considered humane.\r\n\r\nTake any class of white men, however uneducated, and place them under\r\nthe same system of laws, and make their civil condition in all respects\r\nlike that of the negro, and would it not be considered the most\r\noutrageous cruelty?\r\n\r\nSuppose the slave-law were enacted with regard to all the Irish in our\r\ncountry, and they were parcelled off as the property of any man who had\r\nmoney enough to buy them. Suppose their right to vote, their right to\r\nbring suit in any case, their right to bear testimony in courts of\r\njustice, their right to contract a legal marriage, their right to hold\r\nproperty or to make contracts of any sort, were all by one stroke of law\r\nblotted out. Furthermore, suppose it was forbidden to teach them to read\r\nand write, and that their children to all ages were “doomed to live\r\nwithout knowledge.” Suppose that, in judicial proceedings, it were\r\nsolemnly declared, with regard to them, that the _mere beating_ of an\r\nIrishman, “apart from any circumstances of cruelty, or any attempt to\r\nkill,” was no offence against the peace of the state. Suppose that it\r\nwere declared that, for the better preservation of subjection among\r\nthem, the law would protect the master in any kind of punishment\r\ninflicted, even if it should appear to be malicious, cruel and\r\nexcessive; and suppose that monsters like Souther, in availing\r\nthemselves of this permission, should occasionally torture Irishmen to\r\ndeath, but still this circumstance should not be deemed of sufficient\r\nimportance to call for any restriction on the part of the master.\r\nSuppose it should be coolly said, “O yes, Irishmen are occasionally\r\ntortured to death, we know; but it is not by any means a _general_\r\noccurrence; in fact, no men of position in society would do it; and when\r\ncases of the kind do occur, they are indignantly frowned upon.”\r\n\r\nSuppose it should be stated that the reason that the law restraining the\r\npower of the master cannot be made any more stringent is, that the\r\ngeneral system cannot be maintained without allowing this extent of\r\npower to the master.\r\n\r\nSuppose that, having got all the Irishmen in the country down into this\r\ncondition, they should maintain that such was the public sentiment of\r\nhumanity with regard to them as abundantly to supply the want of all\r\nlegal rights, and to make their condition, on the whole, happier than if\r\nthey were free. Should we not say that a public sentiment which saw no\r\ncruelty in thus depriving a whole race of every right dear to manhood\r\ncould see no cruelty in anything, and had proved itself wholly unfit to\r\njudge upon the subject? What man would not rather see his children in\r\nthe grave than see them slaves? What man, who, should he wake to-morrow\r\nmorning in the condition of an American slave, would not wish himself in\r\nthe grave? And yet all the defenders of slavery start from the point\r\nthat this legal condition is not _of itself_ a cruelty! They would hold\r\nit the last excess of cruelty with regard to themselves, or any white\r\nman; why do they call it no cruelty at all with regard to the negro?\r\n\r\nThe writer in defence of slavery in _Fraser’s Magazine_ justifies this\r\ndepriving of a whole class of any legal rights, by urging that “the good\r\nthere is in human nature will supply the deficiencies of human\r\nlegislation.” This remark is one most significant, powerful index of the\r\nstate of public sentiment, produced even in a generous mind, by the\r\nslave system. This writer thinks the good there is in human nature will\r\nsupply the absence of all legal rights to thousands and millions of\r\nhuman beings. He thinks it right to risk their bodies and their souls on\r\nthe good there is in human nature; yet this very man would not send a\r\nfifty-dollar bill through the post-office, in an unsealed letter,\r\ntrusting to “the good there is in human nature.”\r\n\r\nWould this man dare to place his children in the position of slaves, and\r\ntrust them to “the good in human nature”?\r\n\r\nWould he buy an estate from the most honorable man of his acquaintance,\r\nand have no legal record of the deed, trusting to “the good in human\r\nnature”? And if “the good in human nature” will not suffice for him and\r\nhis children, how will it suffice for his brother and his brother’s\r\nchildren? Is his happiness of any more importance in God’s sight than\r\nhis brother’s happiness, that his must be secured by legal bolts, and\r\nbonds, and bars, and his brother’s left to “the good there is in human\r\nnature”? Never are we so impressed with the utter deadness of public\r\nsentiment to protect the slave, as when we see such opinions as these\r\nuttered by men of a naturally generous and noble character.\r\n\r\nThe most striking and the most painful examples of the perversion of\r\npublic sentiment, with regard to the negro race, are often given in the\r\nwritings of men of humanity, amiableness and piety.\r\n\r\nThat devoted laborer for the slave, the Rev. Charles C. Jones, thus\r\nexpresses his sense of the importance of one African soul:\r\n\r\n  Were it now revealed to us that the most extensive system of\r\n  instruction which we could devise, requiring a vast amount of labor\r\n  and protracted through ages, would result in the tender mercy of our\r\n  God in the salvation of the soul of _one poor African_, we should\r\n  feel warranted in cheerfully entering upon our work, with all its\r\n  costs and sacrifices.\r\n\r\nWhat a noble, what a sublime spirit, is here breathed! Does it not show\r\na mind capable of the very highest impulses?\r\n\r\nAnd yet, if we look over his whole writings, we shall see painfully how\r\nthe moral sense of the finest mind may be perverted by constant\r\nfamiliarity with such a system.\r\n\r\nWe find him constructing an appeal to masters to have their slaves\r\n_orally_ instructed in religion. In many passages he speaks of oral\r\ninstruction as confessedly an imperfect species of instruction, very\r\nmuch inferior to that which results from personal reading and\r\nexamination of the Word of God. He says, in one place, that in order to\r\ndo much good it must be begun very early in life, and intimates that\r\npeople in advanced years can acquire very little from it; and yet he\r\ndecidedly expresses his opinion that slavery is an institution with\r\nwhich no Christian has cause to interfere.\r\n\r\nThe slaves, according to his own showing, are cut off from the best\r\nmeans for the salvation of their souls, and restricted to one of a very\r\ninferior nature. They are placed under restriction which makes their\r\nsouls as dependent upon others for spiritual food as a man without hands\r\nis dependent upon others for bodily food. He recognizes the fact, which\r\nhis own experience must show him, that the slave is at all times liable\r\nto pass into the hands of those who will not take the trouble thus to\r\nfeed his soul; nay, if we may judge from his urgent appeals to masters,\r\nhe perceives around him many who, having spiritually cut off the slave’s\r\nhands, refuse to feed him. He sees that, by the operation of this law as\r\na matter of fact, thousands are placed in situations where the perdition\r\nof the soul is almost certain, and yet he declares that he does not feel\r\ncalled upon at all to interfere with their civil condition!\r\n\r\nBut, if the soul of every poor African is of that inestimable worth\r\nwhich Mr. Jones believes, does it not follow that he ought to have the\r\nvery best means for getting to heaven which it is possible to give him?\r\nAnd is not he who can read the Bible for himself in a better condition\r\nthan he who is dependent upon the reading of another? If it be said that\r\nsuch teaching cannot be afforded, because it makes them unsafe property,\r\nought not a clergyman like Mr. Jones to meet this objection in his own\r\nexpressive language:\r\n\r\n  Were it now revealed to us that the most extensive system of\r\n  instruction which we could devise, requiring a vast amount of labor\r\n  and protracted through ages, would result in the tender mercy of our\r\n  God in the salvation of the soul of _one poor African_, we should\r\n  feel warranted in cheerfully entering upon our work, with all its\r\n  costs and sacrifices.\r\n\r\nShould not a clergyman, like Mr. Jones, tell masters that they should\r\nrisk the loss of all things seen and temporal, rather than incur the\r\nhazard of bringing eternal ruin on these souls? All the arguments which\r\nMr. Jones so eloquently used with masters, to persuade them to give\r\ntheir slaves oral instruction, would apply with double force to show\r\ntheir obligation to give the slave the power of reading the Bible for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAgain, we come to hear Mr. Jones telling masters of the power they have\r\nover the souls of their servants, and we hear him say,\r\n\r\n  We may, according to the power lodged in our hands, forbid religious\r\n  meetings and religious instruction on our own plantations; we may\r\n  forbid our servants going to church at all, or only to such churches\r\n  as we may select for them. We may literally shut up the kingdom of\r\n  heaven against men, and suffer not them that are entering to go in.\r\n\r\nAnd, when we hear Mr. Jones say all this, and then consider that he must\r\nsee and know this awful power is often lodged in the hands of wholly\r\nirreligious men, in the hands of men of the most profligate character,\r\nwe can account for his thinking such a system right only by attributing\r\nit to that blinding, deadening influence which the public sentiment of\r\nslavery exerts even over the best-constituted minds.\r\n\r\nNeither Mr. Jones nor any other Christian minister would feel it right\r\nthat the eternal happiness of their own children should be thus placed\r\nin the power of any man who should have money to pay for them. How,\r\nthen, can they think it right that this power be given in the case of\r\ntheir African brother?\r\n\r\nDoes this not show that, even in case of the most humane and Christian\r\npeople, who theoretically believe in the equality of all souls before\r\nGod, a constant familiarity with slavery works a practical infidelity on\r\nthis point; and that they give their assent to laws which practically\r\ndeclare that the salvation of the servant’s soul is of less consequence\r\nthan the salvation of the property relation?\r\n\r\nLet us not be thought invidious or uncharitable in saying, that where\r\nslavery exists there are so many causes necessarily uniting to corrupt\r\npublic sentiment with regard to the slave, that the best-constituted\r\nminds cannot trust themselves in it. In the northern and free states\r\npublic sentiment has been, and is, to this day, fatally infected by the\r\ninfluence of a past and the proximity of a present system of slavery.\r\nHence the injustice with which the negro in many of our states is\r\ntreated. Hence, too, those apologies for slavery, and defences of it,\r\nwhich issue from Northern presses, and even Northern pulpits. If even at\r\nthe North the remains of slavery can produce such baleful effects in\r\ncorrupting public sentiment, how much more must this be the case where\r\nthis institution is in full force!\r\n\r\nThe whole American nation is, in some sense, under a paralysis of public\r\nsentiment on this subject. It was said by a heathen writer that the gods\r\ngave us a fearful power when they gave us the faculty of becoming\r\naccustomed to things. This power has proved a fearful one indeed in\r\nAmerica. We have got used to things which might stir the dead in their\r\ngraves.\r\n\r\nWhen but a small portion of the things daily done in America has been\r\ntold in England, and France, and Italy, and Germany, there has been a\r\nperfect shriek and outcry of horror. America alone remains cool, and\r\nasks, “What is the matter?”\r\n\r\nEurope answers back, “Why, we have heard that men are _sold_ like cattle\r\nin your country.”\r\n\r\n“Of course they are,” says America; “but what then?”\r\n\r\n“We have heard,” says Europe, “that millions of men are forbidden to\r\nread and write in your country.”\r\n\r\n“We know that,” says America; “but what is this outcry about?”\r\n\r\n“We have heard,” says Europe, “that Christian girls are sold to shame in\r\nyour markets!”\r\n\r\n“That isn’t quite as it should be,” says America; “but still what is\r\nthis _excitement_ about?”\r\n\r\n“We hear that three millions of your people can have no legal marriage\r\nties,” says Europe.\r\n\r\n“Certainly that is true,” returns America; “but you made such an outcry,\r\nwe thought you saw some great _cruelty_ going on.”\r\n\r\n“And you profess to be a free country!” says indignant Europe.\r\n\r\n“Certainly we are the freest and most enlightened country in the\r\nworld,—what are you talking about?” says America.\r\n\r\n“You send your missionaries to Christianize us,” says Turkey; “and our\r\nreligion has abolished this horrible system.”\r\n\r\n“You! you are all heathen over there,—what business have you to talk?”\r\nanswers America.\r\n\r\nMany people seem really to have thought that nothing but horrible\r\nexaggerations of the system of slavery could have produced the sensation\r\nwhich has recently been felt in all modern Europe. They do not know that\r\nthe thing they have become accustomed to, and handled so freely in every\r\ndiscussion, seems to all other nations the sum and essence of villany.\r\nModern Europe, opening her eyes and looking on the legal theory of the\r\nslave system, on the laws and interpretations of law which define it,\r\nsays to America, in the language of the indignant Othello, If thou wilt\r\njustify a thing like this,\r\n\r\n            “Never pray more; abandon all remorse;\r\n            On Horror’s head horrors accumulate;\r\n            Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;\r\n            For nothing canst thou to damnation add\r\n            Greater than this.”\r\n\r\nThere is an awful state of familiarity with evil which the apostle calls\r\nbeing “dead in trespasses and sins,” where truth has been resisted, and\r\nevil perseveringly defended, and the convictions of conscience stifled,\r\nand the voice of God’s Holy Spirit bidden to depart. There is an awful\r\nparalysis of the moral sense, when deeds unholiest and crimes most\r\nfearful cease any longer to affect the nerve. That paralysis, always a\r\nfearful indication of the death and dissolution of nations, is a doubly\r\ndangerous disease in a republic, whose only power is in intelligence,\r\njustice and virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                  PUBLIC OPINION FORMED BY EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Charles C. Jones, in his interesting work on the Religious\r\nInstruction of Negroes, has a passage which so peculiarly describes that\r\ninfluence of public opinion which we have been endeavoring to\r\nillustrate, that we shall copy it.\r\n\r\n  Habits of feeling and prejudices in relation to any subject are wont\r\n  to take their rise out of our _education_ or circumstances. Every\r\n  man knows their influence to be great in shaping opinions and\r\n  conduct, and ofttimes how unwittingly they are formed; that while we\r\n  may be unconscious of their existence, they may grow with our growth\r\n  and strengthen with our strength. Familiarity converts deformity\r\n  into comeliness. Hence we are not always the best judges of our\r\n  condition. Another may remark inconveniences, and, indeed, real\r\n  evils, in it, of which we may be said to have been all our lives\r\n  scarcely conscious. So, also, evils which, upon first acquaintance,\r\n  revolted our whole nature, and appeared intolerable, custom almost\r\n  makes us forget even to see. Men passing out of one state of society\r\n  into another encounter a thousand things to which they feel that\r\n  they can never be reconciled; yet, shortly after, their\r\n  sensibilities become dulled,—a change passes over them, they\r\n  scarcely know how. They have accommodated themselves to their new\r\n  circumstances and relations,—they are Romans in Rome.\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire what are the educational influences which bear upon\r\nthe mind educated in constant familiarity with the slave system.\r\n\r\nTake any child of ingenuous mind and of generous heart, and educate him\r\nunder the influences of slavery, and what are the things which go to\r\nform his character? An anecdote which a lady related to the writer may\r\nbe in point in this place. In giving an account of some of the things\r\nwhich induced her to remove her family from under the influence of\r\nslavery, she related the following incident: Looking out of her nursery\r\nwindow one day, she saw her daughter, about three years of age, seated\r\nin her little carriage, with six or eight young negro children harnessed\r\ninto it for horses. Two or three of the older slaves were standing\r\naround their little mistress, and one of them, putting a whip into her\r\nhand, said, “There, Misse, whip ‘em well; make ‘em go,—they’re all your\r\nniggers.”\r\n\r\nWhat a moral and religious lesson was this for that young soul! The\r\nmother was a judicious woman, who never would herself have taught such a\r\nthing; but the whole influence of slave society had burnt it into the\r\nsoul of every negro, and through them it was communicated to the child.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a child is old enough to read the newspapers, he sees in\r\nevery column such notices as the following from a late _Richmond Whig_,\r\nand other papers.\r\n\r\n           LARGE SALE OF NEGROES, HORSES, MULES, CATTLE, &c.\r\n\r\n  The subscriber, under a decree of the Circuit Superior Court for\r\n  Fluvanna County, will proceed to sell, by public auction, at the\r\n  late residence of William Galt, deceased, on TUESDAY, the 30th day\r\n  of November, and WEDNESDAY, the 1st day of December next, beginning\r\n  at 11 o’clock, the negroes, stock, &c., of all kinds, belonging to\r\n  the estate, consisting of 175 _negroes, amongst whom are_ SOME\r\n  CARPENTERS AND BLACKSMITHS,—10 horses, 33 mules, 100 head of cattle,\r\n  100 sheep, 200 hogs, 1500 barrels corn, oats, fodder, &c., the\r\n  plantation and shop tools of all kinds.\r\n\r\n  The Negroes will be sold for cash; the other property on a credit of\r\n  nine months, the purchaser giving bond, with approved security.\r\n\r\n                                       JAMES GALT, _Administrator of\r\n                                               William Galt, deceased_\r\n\r\n  _Oct. 19._\r\n\r\nFrom the _Nashville Gazette_, Nov. 23, 1852:\r\n\r\n               GREAT SALE OF NEGROES, MULES, CATTLE, &c.\r\n\r\n  On TUESDAY, the 21st day of December next, at the Plantation of the\r\n  late N.

After advertising the landed\r\nestate of Madeline Lanoux, deceased, comes the following enumeration of\r\nchattels:\r\n\r\n  Twelve slaves, men and women; a small, quite new schooner; a\r\n  ferrying flat-boat; some cows, calves, heifers and sheep; a lot of\r\n  household furniture; the contents of a store, consisting of\r\n  hardware, crockery ware, groceries, dry goods, etc.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose all parents to be as pious and benevolent as Mr. Jones,—a\r\nthing not at all to be hoped for, as things are;—and suppose them to try\r\ntheir very best to impress on the child a conviction that all souls are\r\nof equal value in the sight of God; that the negro soul is as truly\r\nbeloved of Christ, and ransomed with his blood, as the master’s; and is\r\nthere any such thing as making him believe or realize it? Will he\r\nbelieve that that which he sees, every week, advertised with hogs, and\r\nhorses, and fodder, and cotton-seed, and refuse furniture,—bedsteads,\r\ntables and chairs,—is indeed so divine a thing? We will suppose that the\r\nlittle child knows some pious slave; that he sees him at the\r\ncommunion-table, partaking, in a far-off, solitary manner, of the\r\nsacramental bread and wine. He sees his pious father and mother\r\nrecognize the slave as a Christian brother; they tell him that he is an\r\n“heir of God, a joint heir with Jesus Christ;” and the next week he sees\r\nhim advertised in the paper, in company with a lot of hogs, stock and\r\nfodder. Can the child possibly believe in what his Christian parents\r\nhave told him, when he sees this? We have spoken now of only the common\r\nadvertisements of the paper; but suppose the child to live in some\r\ndistricts of the country, and advertisements of a still more degrading\r\ncharacter meet his eye. In the State of Alabama, a newspaper devoted to\r\npolitics, literature and EDUCATION, has a standing weekly advertisement\r\nof which this is a copy:\r\n\r\n                                NOTICE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  The undersigned having an excellent pack of HOUNDS, for trailing and\r\n  catching runaway slaves, informs the public that his prices in\r\n  future will be as follows for such services:\r\n\r\n          For each day employed in hunting or trailing, $2.50\r\n          For catching each slave,                      10.00\r\n          For going over ten miles and catching slaves, 20.00\r\n\r\n  If sent for, the above prices will be exacted in cash. The\r\n  subscriber resides one mile and a half south of Dadeville, Ala.\r\n\r\n                                                             B. BLACK.\r\n\r\n  _Dadeville, Sept. 1, 1852._      1tf\r\n\r\nThe reader will see, by the printer’s sign at the bottom, that it is a\r\nseason advertisement, and, therefore, would meet the eye of the child\r\nweek after week. The paper from which we have cut this contains among\r\nits extracts passages from Dickens’ _Household Words_, from Professor\r\nFelton’s article in the _Christian Examiner_ on the relation of the\r\nsexes, and a most beautiful and chivalrous appeal from the eloquent\r\nsenator Soulé on the legal rights of women. Let us now ask, since this\r\npaper is devoted to education, what sort of an educational influence\r\nsuch advertisements have. And, of course, such an establishment is not\r\nkept up without patronage. Where there are negro-hunters advertising in\r\na paper, there are also negro-hunts, and there are dogs being trained to\r\nhunt; and all this process goes on before the eyes of children; and what\r\nsort of education is it?\r\n\r\nThe writer has received an account of the way in which dogs are trained\r\nfor this business. The information has been communicated to the\r\ngentleman who writes it by a negro man, who, having been always\r\naccustomed to see it done, described it with as little sense of there\r\nbeing anything out of the way in it as if the dogs had been trained to\r\ncatch raccoons. It came to the writer in a recent letter from the South.\r\n\r\n  The way to train ‘em (says the man) is to take these yer pups,—any\r\n  kind o’ pups will do,—fox-hounds, bull-dogs, most any;—but take the\r\n  pups, and keep ‘em shut up and don’t let ‘em never see a nigger till\r\n  they get big enough to be larned. When the pups gits old enough to\r\n  be set on to things, then make ‘em run after a nigger; and when they\r\n  cotches him, give ‘em meat. Tell the nigger to run as hard as he\r\n  can, and git up in a tree, so as to larn the dogs to tree ‘em; then\r\n  take the shoe of a nigger, and larn ‘em to find the nigger it\r\n  belongs to; then a rag of his clothes; and so on. Allers be carful\r\n  to tree the nigger, and teach the dog to wait and bark under the\r\n  tree till you come up and give him his meat.\r\n\r\nSee also the following advertisement from the _Ouachita Register_, a\r\nnewspaper dated “Monroe, La., Tuesday evening, June 1, 1852.”\r\n\r\n                              NEGRO DOGS.\r\n\r\n  The undersigned would respectfully inform the citizens of Ouachita\r\n  and adjacent parishes, that he has located about 2½ miles east of\r\n  John White’s, on the road leading from Monroe to Bastrop, and that\r\n  he has a fine pack of Dogs for catching negroes. Persons wishing\r\n  negroes caught will do well to give him a call. He can always be\r\n  found at his stand when not engaged in hunting, and even then\r\n  information of his whereabouts can always be had of some one on the\r\n  premises.\r\n\r\n  _Terms._—Five dollars per day and found, when there is no track\r\n  pointed out. When the track is shown, twenty-five dollars will be\r\n  charged for catching the negro.\r\n\r\n                                                           M. C. GOFF.\r\n\r\n  Monroe, Feb. 17, 1852.      15–3m\r\n\r\nNow, do not all the scenes likely to be enacted under this head form a\r\nfine education for the children of a Christian nation? and can we wonder\r\nif children so formed see no cruelty in slavery? Can children realize\r\nthat creatures who are thus hunted are the children of one heavenly\r\nFather with themselves?\r\n\r\nBut suppose the boy grows up to be a man, and attends the courts of\r\njustice, and hears intelligent, learned men declaring from the bench\r\nthat “the mere beating of a slave, unaccompanied by any circumstances of\r\ncruelty, or an attempt to kill, is no breach of the peace of the state.”\r\nSuppose he hears it decided in the same place that no insult or outrage\r\nupon any slave is considered worthy of legal redress, unless it impairs\r\nhis property value. Suppose he hears, as he would in Virginia, that it\r\nis the policy of the law to protect the master even in inflicting cruel,\r\nmalicious and excessive punishment upon the slave. Suppose a slave is\r\nmurdered, and he hears the lawyers arguing that it cannot be considered\r\na murder, because the slave, in law, is not considered a human being;\r\nand then suppose the case is appealed to a superior court, and he hears\r\nthe judge expending his forces on a long and eloquent dissertation to\r\nprove that the slave _is_ a human being; at least, that he is as much so\r\nas a lunatic, an idiot, or an unborn child, and that, therefore, he can\r\nbe murdered. (See Judge Clark’s speech, on p. 75.) Suppose he sees that\r\nall the administration of law with regard to the slave proceeds on the\r\nidea that he is absolutely nothing more than a bale of merchandise.\r\nSuppose he hears such language as this, which occurs in the reasonings\r\nof the Brazealle case, and which is a fair sample of the manner in which\r\nsuch subjects are ordinarily discussed. “The slave has no more political\r\ncapacity, no more right to purchase, hold or transfer property, than the\r\nmule in his plough; he is in himself but a mere chattel,—the subject of\r\nabsolute ownership.” Suppose he sees on the statute-book such sentences\r\nas these, from the civil code of Louisiana:\r\n\r\n  Art. 2500. The latent defects of slaves and animals are divided into\r\n  two classes,—vices of body and vices of character.\r\n\r\n  Art. 2501. The vices of body are distinguished into absolute and\r\n  relative.\r\n\r\n  Art. 2502. The absolute vices of slaves are leprosy, madness and\r\n  epilepsy.\r\n\r\n  Art. 2503. The absolute vices of horses and mules are short wind,\r\n  glanders, and founder.\r\n\r\nThe influence of this language is made all the stronger on the young\r\nmind from the fact that it is not the language of contempt, or of\r\npassion, but of calm, matter-of-fact, legal statement.\r\n\r\nWhat effect must be produced on the mind of the young man when he comes\r\nto see that, however atrocious and however well-proved be the murder of\r\na slave, the murderer uniformly escapes; and that, though the cases\r\nwhere the slave has fallen a victim to passions of the white are so\r\nmultiplied, yet the fact of an execution for such a crime is yet almost\r\nunknown in the country? Does not all this tend to produce exactly that\r\nestimate of the value of negro life and happiness which Frederic\r\nDouglass says was expressed by a common proverb among the white boys\r\nwhere he was brought up: “It’s worth sixpence to kill a nigger, and\r\nsixpence more to bury him”?\r\n\r\nWe see the public sentiment which has been formed by this kind of\r\neducation exhibited by the following paragraph from the _Cambridge\r\nDemocrat_, Md., Oct. 27, 1852. That paper quotes the following from the\r\n_Woodville Republican_, of Mississippi. It seems a Mr. Joshua Johns had\r\nkilled a slave, and had been sentenced therefor to the penitentiary for\r\ntwo years. The _Republican_ thus laments his hard lot:\r\n\r\n                        STATE _v._ JOSHUA JOHNS.\r\n\r\n  This cause resulted in the conviction of Johns, and his sentence to\r\n  the penitentiary for two years. Although every member of the jury,\r\n  together with the bar, and the public generally, signed a petition\r\n  to the governor for young Johns’ pardon, yet there was no fault to\r\n  find with the verdict of the jury. The extreme youth of Johns, and\r\n  the circumstances in which the killing occurred, enlisted universal\r\n  sympathy in his favor. There is no doubt that the negro had provoked\r\n  him to the deed by the use of insolent language; but how often must\r\n  it be told that words are no justification for blows? There are\r\n  _many_ persons—and we regret to say it—_who think they have the same\r\n  right to shoot a negro, if he insults them, or even runs from them,\r\n  that they have to shoot down a dog_; but there are laws for the\r\n  protection of the slave as well as the master, and the sooner the\r\n  _error above alluded to is removed_, the better will it be for both\r\n  parties.\r\n\r\n  The unfortunate youth who has now entailed upon himself the penalty\r\n  of the law, we doubt not, had no idea that there existed such\r\n  penalty; and even if he was aware of the fact, the repeated insults\r\n  and taunts of the negro go far to mitigate the crime. Johns was\r\n  defended by I. D. Gildart, Esq., who probably did all that could\r\n  have been effected in his defence.\r\n\r\nThe _Democrat_ adds:\r\n\r\n  We learn from Mr. Curry, deputy sheriff, of Wilkinson County, that\r\n  Johns has been pardoned by the governor. We are gratified to hear\r\n  it.\r\n\r\nThis error above alluded to, of thinking it is as innocent to shoot down\r\na negro as a dog, is one, we fairly admit, for which young Johns ought\r\nnot to be very severely blamed. He has been educated in a system of\r\nthings of which this opinion is the inevitable result; and he,\r\nindividually, is far less guilty for it, than are those men who support\r\nthe system of laws, and keep up the educational influences, which lead\r\nyoung Southern men directly to this conclusion. Johns may be, for aught\r\nwe know, as generous-hearted and as just naturally as any young man\r\nliving; but the horrible system under which he has been educated has\r\nrendered him incapable of distinguishing what either generosity or\r\njustice is, as applied to the negro.\r\n\r\nThe public sentiment of the slave states is the sentiment of men who\r\nhave been thus educated, and in all that concerns the negro it is\r\nutterly blunted and paralyzed. What would seem to them injustice and\r\nhorrible wrong in the case of white persons, is the coolest matter of\r\ncourse in relation to slaves.\r\n\r\nAs this educational influence descends from generation to generation,\r\nthe moral sense becomes more and more blunted, and the power of\r\ndiscriminating right from wrong, in what relates to the subject race,\r\nmore and more enfeebled.\r\n\r\nThus, if we read the writings of distinguished men who were\r\nslave-holders about the time of our American Revolution, what clear\r\nviews do we find expressed of the injustice of slavery, what strong\r\nlanguage of reprobation do we find applied to it! Nothing more forcible\r\ncould possibly be said in relation to its evils than by quoting the\r\nlanguage of such men as Washington, Jefferson, and Patrick Henry. In\r\nthose days there were no men of that high class of mind who thought of\r\nsuch a thing as defending slavery on principle: now there are an\r\nabundance of the most distinguished men, North and South, statesmen,\r\ncivilians, men of letters, even clergymen, who in various degrees\r\npalliate it, apologize for or openly defend it. And what is the cause of\r\nthis, except that educational influences have corrupted public\r\nsentiment, and deprived them of the power of just judgment? _The public\r\nopinion even of free America, with regard to slavery, is behind that of\r\nall other civilized nations._\r\n\r\nWhen the holders of slaves assert that they are, as a general thing,\r\nhumanely treated, what do they mean? Not that they would consider such\r\ntreatment humane if given to themselves and their children,—no,\r\nindeed!—but it is humane _for slaves_.\r\n\r\nThey do, in effect, place the negro below the range of humanity, and on\r\na level with brutes, and then graduate all their ideas of humanity\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nThey would not needlessly kick or abuse a dog or a negro. They may pet a\r\ndog, and they often do a negro. Men have been found who fancied having\r\ntheir horses elegantly lodged in marble stables, and to eat out of\r\nsculptured mangers, but they thought them horses still; and, with all\r\nthe indulgences with which good-natured masters sometimes surround the\r\nslave, he is to them but a negro still, and _not_ a man.\r\n\r\nIn what has been said in this chapter, and in what appears incidentally\r\nin all the facts cited throughout this volume, there is abundant proof\r\nthat, notwithstanding there be frequent and most noble instances of\r\ngenerosity towards the negro, and although the sentiment of honorable\r\nmen and the voice of Christian charity does everywhere protest against\r\nwhat it _feels_ to be inhumanity, yet the popular sentiment engendered\r\nby the system must _necessarily_ fall deplorably short of giving\r\nanything like sufficient protection to the rights of the slave. It will\r\nappear in the succeeding chapters, as it must already have appeared to\r\nreflecting minds, that the whole course of educational influence upon\r\nthe mind of the slave-master is such as to deaden his mind to those\r\nappeals which come from the negro as a fellow-man and a brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                        SEPARATION OF FAMILIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “What must the difference be,” said Dr. Worthington, with startling\r\n  energy, “between Isabel and her servants! To _her_ it is loss of\r\n  position, fortune, the fair hopes of life, perhaps even health; for\r\n  she must inevitably break down under the unaccustomed labor and\r\n  privations she will have to undergo. But to them it is _merely a\r\n  change of masters_”!\r\n\r\n  “Yes, for the neighbors won’t allow any of the families to be\r\n  separated.”\r\n\r\n  “Of course not. We read of such things in _novels_ sometimes. But I\r\n  have yet to see it in real life, except in rare cases, or where the\r\n  slave has been guilty of some misdemeanor, or crime, for which, in\r\n  the North, he would have been imprisoned, perhaps for life.”—_Cabin\r\n  and Parlor_, by J. Thornton Randolph, p. 39.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “But they’re going to sell us all to Georgia, I say. How are we to\r\n  escape that?”\r\n\r\n  “Spec dare some mistake in dat,” replied Uncle Peter, stoutly. “I\r\n  nebber knew of sich a ting in dese parts, ‘cept where some niggar’d\r\n  been berry bad.”—_Ibid._\r\n\r\nBy such graphic touches as the above does Mr. Thornton Randolph\r\nrepresent to us the patriarchal stability and security of the slave\r\npopulation in the Old Dominion. Such a thing as a slave being sold out\r\nof the state has never been heard of by Dr. Worthington, except in rare\r\ncases for some crime; and old Uncle Peter never heard of such a thing in\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nAre these representations true?\r\n\r\nThe worst abuse of the system of slavery is its outrage upon the family;\r\nand, as the writer views the subject, it is one which is more notorious\r\nand undeniable than any other.\r\n\r\nYet it is upon this point that the most stringent and earnest denial has\r\nbeen made to the representations of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” either\r\nindirectly, as by the romance-writer above, or more directly in the\r\nassertions of newspapers, both at the North and at the South. When made\r\nat the North, they indicate, to say the least, very great ignorance of\r\nthe subject; when made at the South, they certainly do very great\r\ninjustice to the general character of the Southerner for truth and\r\nhonesty. All sections of country have faults peculiar to themselves. The\r\nfault of the South, as a general thing, has not been cowardly evasion\r\nand deception. It was with utter surprise that the author read the\r\nfollowing sentences in an article in _Fraser’s Magazine_, professing to\r\ncome from a South Carolinian.\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Stowe’s favorite illustration of the master’s power to the\r\n  injury of the slave is the separation of families. We are told of\r\n  infants of ten months old being sold from the arms of their mothers,\r\n  and of men whose habit it is to raise children to sell away from\r\n  their mother as soon as they are old enough to be separated. Were\r\n  our views of this feature of slavery derived from Mrs. Stowe’s book,\r\n  we should regard the families of slaves as utterly unsettled and\r\n  vagrant.\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n  We feel confident that, if statistics could be had to throw light\r\n  upon this subject, we should find that there is less separation of\r\n  families among the negroes than occurs with almost any other class\r\n  of persons.\r\n\r\nAs the author of the article, however, is evidently a man of honor, and\r\nexpresses many most noble and praiseworthy sentiments, it cannot be\r\nsupposed that these statements were put forth with any view to\r\nmisrepresent or to deceive. They are only to be regarded as evidences of\r\nthe facility with which a sanguine mind often overlooks the most glaring\r\nfacts that make against a favorite idea or theory, or which are\r\nunfavorable in their bearings on one’s own country or family. Thus the\r\ncitizens of some place notoriously unhealthy will come to believe, and\r\nassert, with the utmost sincerity, that there is actually less sickness\r\nin their town than any other of its size in the known world. Thus\r\nparents often think their children perfectly immaculate in just those\r\nparticulars in which others see them to be most faulty. This solution of\r\nthe phenomena is a natural and amiable one, and enables us to retain our\r\nrespect for our Southern brethren.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance, also, to be taken into account, in\r\nreading such assertions as these. It is evident, from the pamphlet in\r\nquestion, that the writer is one of the few who regard the possession of\r\nabsolute irresponsible power as the highest of motives to moderation and\r\ntemperance in its use. Such men are commonly associated in friendship\r\nand family connection with others of similar views, and are very apt to\r\nfall into the error of judging others by themselves, and thinking that a\r\nthing may do for all the world because it operates well in their\r\nimmediate circle. Also it cannot but be a fact that the various\r\ncircumstances which from infancy conspire to degrade and depress the\r\nnegro in the eyes of a Southern-born man,—the constant habit of speaking\r\nof them, and hearing them spoken of, and seeing them advertised, as mere\r\narticles of property, often in connection with horses, mules, fodder,\r\nswine, &c., as they are almost daily in every Southern paper,—must tend,\r\neven in the best-constituted minds, to produce a certain obtuseness with\r\nregard to the interests, sufferings and affections, of such as do not\r\nparticularly belong to himself, which will peculiarly unfit him for\r\nestimating their condition. The author has often been singularly struck\r\nwith this fact, in the letters of Southern friends; in which, upon one\r\npage, they will make some assertion regarding the condition of Southern\r\nnegroes, and then go on, and in other connections state facts which\r\napparently contradict them all. We can all be aware how this familiarity\r\nwould operate with ourselves. Were we called upon to state how often our\r\nneighbors’ cows were separated from their calves, or how often their\r\nhousehold furniture and other effects are scattered and dispersed by\r\nexecutor’s sales, we should be inclined to say that it was not a\r\nmisfortune of very common occurrence.\r\n\r\nBut let us open two South Carolina papers, published in the very state\r\nwhere this gentleman is residing, and read the advertisements FOR ONE\r\nWEEK. The author has slightly abridged them.\r\n\r\n               COMMISSIONER’S SALE OF 12 LIKELY NEGROES.\r\n\r\n                          FAIRFIELD DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n                R. W.

They make no impression upon him. His own family\r\nservants, and those of his friends, are not in the market, and he does\r\nnot realize that any are. Under the advertisements, a hundred such\r\nscenes as those described in “Uncle Tom” may have been acting in his\r\nvery vicinity. When Mr. Dickens drew pictures of the want and\r\nwretchedness of London life, perhaps a similar incredulity might have\r\nbeen expressed within the silken curtains of many a brilliant parlor.\r\n_They_ had never seen such things, and they had always lived in London.\r\nBut, for all that, the writings of Dickens awoke in noble and\r\naristocratic bosoms the sense of a common humanity with the lowly, and\r\nled them to feel how much misery might exist in their immediate\r\nvicinity, of which they were entirely unaware. They have never accused\r\nhim as a libeller of his country, though he did make manifest much of\r\nthe suffering, sorrow and abuse, which were in it. The author is led\r\nearnestly to entreat that the writer of this very paper _would_ examine\r\nthe “statistics” of the American internal slave-trade; that he would\r\nlook over the exchange files of some newspaper, and, for a month or two,\r\nendeavor to keep some inventory of the number of human beings, with\r\nhearts, hopes and affections, like his own, who are constantly subjected\r\nto all the uncertainties and mutations of property relation. The writer\r\nis sure that he could not do it long without a generous desire being\r\nexcited in his bosom to become, not an apologist for, but a reformer of,\r\nthese institutions of his country.\r\n\r\nThese papers of South Carolina are not exceptional ones; they may be\r\nmatched by hundreds of papers from any other state.\r\n\r\nLet the reader now stop one minute, and look over again these two weeks’\r\nadvertisements. This is not novel-writing—_this_ is fact. See these\r\nhuman beings tumbled promiscuously out before the public with horses,\r\nmules, second-hand buggies, cotton-seed, bedsteads, &c. &c.; and\r\nChristian ladies, in the same newspaper, saying that they prayerfully\r\nstudy God’s word, and believe their institutions have his sanction! Does\r\nhe suppose that here, in these two weeks, there have been no scenes of\r\nsuffering? Imagine the distress of these families—the nights of anxiety\r\nof these mothers and children, wives and husbands, when these sales are\r\nabout to take place! Imagine the scenes of the sales! A young lady, a\r\nfriend of the writer, who spent a winter in Carolina, described to her\r\nthe sale of a woman and her children. When the little girl, seven years\r\nof age, was put on the block, she fell into spasms with fear and\r\nexcitement. She was taken off—recovered and put back—the spasms came\r\nback—three times the experiment was tried, and at last the sale of the\r\n_child_ was deferred!\r\n\r\nSee also the following, from Dr. Elwood Harvey, editor of a western\r\npaper, to the _Pennsylvania Freeman_, Dec. 25, 1846.\r\n\r\n  We attended a sale of land and other property, near Petersburg,\r\n  Virginia, and unexpectedly saw slaves sold at public auction. The\r\n  slaves were told they would not be sold, and were collected in front\r\n  of the quarters, gazing on the assembled multitude. The land being\r\n  sold, the auctioneer’s loud voice was heard, “Bring up the\r\n  _niggers_!” A shade of astonishment and affright passed over their\r\n  faces, as they stared first at each other, and then at the crowd of\r\n  purchasers, whose attention was now directed to them. When the\r\n  horrible truth was revealed to their minds that they were to be\r\n  sold, and nearest relations and friends parted forever, the effect\r\n  was indescribably agonizing. Women snatched up their babes, and ran\r\n  screaming into the huts. Children hid behind the huts and trees, and\r\n  the men stood in mute despair. The auctioneer stood on the portico\r\n  of the house, and the “men and boys” were ranging in the yard for\r\n  inspection. It was announced that no warranty of _soundness_ was\r\n  given, and purchasers must examine for themselves. A few old men\r\n  were sold at prices from thirteen to twenty-five dollars, and it was\r\n  painful to see old men, bowed with years of toil and suffering,\r\n  stand up to be the jest of brutal tyrants, and to hear them tell\r\n  their disease and worthlessness, fearing that they would be bought\r\n  by traders for the southern market.\r\n\r\n  A white boy, about fifteen years old, was placed on the stand. His\r\n  hair was brown and straight, his skin exactly the same hue as other\r\n  white persons and no discernible trace of negro features in his\r\n  countenance.\r\n\r\n  Some vulgar jests were passed on his color, and two hundred dollars\r\n  was bid for him; but the audience said “that it was not enough to\r\n  begin on for such a likely young nigger.” Several remarked that they\r\n  “would not have him as a gift.” Some said a white nigger was more\r\n  trouble than he was worth. One man said it was wrong to sell _white_\r\n  people. I asked him if it was more wrong than to sell black people.\r\n  He made no reply. Before he was sold, his mother rushed from the\r\n  house upon the portico, crying, in frantic grief, “My son, O! my\r\n  boy, they will take away my dear—” Here her voice was lost, as she\r\n  was rudely pushed back and the door closed. The sale was not for a\r\n  moment interrupted, and none of the crowd appeared to be in the\r\n  least affected by the scene. The poor boy, afraid to cry before so\r\n  many strangers, who showed no signs of sympathy or pity, trembled,\r\n  and wiped the tears from his cheeks with his sleeves. He was sold\r\n  for about two hundred and fifty dollars. During the sale, the\r\n  quarters resounded with cries and lamentations that made my heart\r\n  ache. A woman was next called by name. She gave her infant one wild\r\n  embrace before leaving it with an old woman, and hastened\r\n  mechanically to obey the call; but stopped, threw her arms aloft,\r\n  screamed and was unable to move.\r\n\r\n  One of my companions touched my shoulder and said, “Come, let us\r\n  leave here; I can bear no more.” We left the ground. The man who\r\n  drove our carriage from Petersburg had two sons who belonged to the\r\n  estate—small boys. He obtained a promise that they should not be\r\n  sold. He was asked if they were his only children; he answered, “All\r\n  that’s left of eight.” Three others had been sold to the south, and\r\n  he would never see or hear from them again.\r\n\r\n  As Northern people do not see such things, they should hear of them\r\n  often enough to keep them awake to the sufferings of the victims of\r\n  their indifference.\r\n\r\nSuch are the _common_ incidents, not the _admitted cruelties_, of an\r\ninstitution which people have brought themselves to feel is in\r\naccordance with God’s word!\r\n\r\nSuppose it be conceded now that “the family relation is protected, _as\r\nfar as possible_.” The question still arises, _How far is it possible_?\r\nAdvertisements of sales to the number of those we have quoted, more or\r\nless, appear from week to week in the same papers, in the same\r\nneighborhood; and professional traders make it their business to attend\r\nthem, and buy up victims. Now, if the inhabitants of a given\r\nneighborhood charge themselves with the care to see that no families are\r\nseparated in this whirl of auctioneering, one would fancy that they\r\ncould have very little else to do. It _is_ a fact, and a most honorable\r\none to our common human nature, that the distress and anguish of these\r\npoor, helpless creatures does often raise up for them friends among the\r\ngenerous-hearted. Southern men often go to the extent of their means,\r\nand beyond their means, to arrest the cruel operations of trade, and\r\nrelieve cases of individual distress. There are men at the South who\r\ncould tell, if they would, how, when they have spent the last dollar\r\nthat they thought they could afford on one week, they have been\r\nimportuned by precisely such a case the next, and been unable to meet\r\nit. There are masters at the South who could tell, if they would, how\r\nthey have stood and bid against a trader, to redeem some poor slave of\r\ntheir own, till the bidding was perfectly ruinous, and they have been\r\nobliged to give up by sheer necessity. Good-natured auctioneers know\r\nvery well how they have often been entreated to connive at keeping a\r\npoor fellow out of the trader’s clutches; and how sometimes they\r\nsucceed, and sometimes they do not.\r\n\r\nThe very struggle and effort which generous Southern men make to stop\r\nthe regular course of trade only shows them the hopelessness of the\r\neffort. We fully concede that many of them do as much or more than any\r\nof us would do under similar circumstances; and yet _they know_ that\r\nwhat they do amounts, after all, to the merest trifle.\r\n\r\nBut let us still further reason upon the testimony of advertisements.\r\nWhat is to be understood by the following, of the _Memphis Eagle and\r\nInquirer_, Saturday, Nov. 13, 1852?

We have as safe a jail as\r\n  any in the country, where we can keep negroes safe for those that\r\n  wish them kept.\r\n\r\n                                                 BOLTON, DICKINS & CO.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of advertisements No. 1, let us humbly inquire what\r\n“_assorted A No. 1 Negroes_” means. Is it likely that it means negroes\r\nsold in families? What is meant by the invitation. “_Call soon if you\r\nwant to get the first choice_”?\r\n\r\nSo much for Advertisement No. 1. Let us now propound a few questions to\r\nthe initiated on No. 2. What does Mr. Benjamin Little mean by saying\r\nthat he “_will pay as high a cash price for a few likely young negroes\r\nas any trader in the city_”? Do _families_ commonly consist exclusively\r\nof “_likely young negroes_”?\r\n\r\nOn the third advertisement we are also desirous of some information.\r\nMessrs. BOLTON, DICKINS & CO. state that they expect to receive a large\r\nlot of _Virginia_ negroes in the fall.\r\n\r\nUnfortunate Messrs. Bolton, Dickins & Co.! Do you suppose that Virginia\r\nfamilies will sell their negroes? Have you read Mr. J. Thornton\r\nRandolph’s last novel, and have you not learned that old Virginia\r\nfamilies _never_ sell to traders? and, more than that, that they\r\n_always_ club together and buy up the negroes that are for sale in their\r\nneighborhood, and the traders when they appear on the ground are hustled\r\noff with very little ceremony? One would really think that you had got\r\nyour impressions on the subject from “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” For we are\r\ntold that all who derive their views of slavery from this book “regard\r\nthe families of slaves as utterly unsettled and vagrant.”[18]\r\n\r\nBut, before we recover from our astonishment on reading this, we take up\r\nthe _Natchez_ (Mississippi) _Courier_ of Nov. 20th, 1852, and there\r\nread:\r\n\r\n                                NEGROES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  The undersigned would respectfully state to the public that he has\r\n  leased the stand in the Forks of the Road, near Natchez, for a term\r\n  of years, and that he intends to keep a large lot of NEGROES on hand\r\n  during the year. He will sell as low or lower than any other trader\r\n  at this place or in New Orleans.\r\n\r\n  He has just arrived from Virginia with a very likely lot of Field\r\n  Men and Women; also, House Servants, three Cooks, and a Carpenter.\r\n  Call and see.\r\n\r\n  A fine Buggy Horse, a Saddle Horse and a Carryall, on hand, and for\r\n  sale.\r\n\r\n                                                       THOS. G. JAMES.\r\n\r\n  _Natchez, Sept. 28, 1852._\r\n\r\nWhere in the world did this lucky Mr. THOS. G. JAMES get this likely\r\nVirginia “assortment”? Probably in some county which Mr. Thornton\r\nRandolph never visited. And had no families been separated to form the\r\nassortment? We hear of a lot of field men and women. Where are their\r\nchildren? We hear of a lot of house-servants,—of “three cooks,” and “one\r\ncarpenter,” as well as a “fine buggy horse.” Had these unfortunate cooks\r\nand carpenters no relations? Did no sad natural tears stream down their\r\ndark checks, when they were being “assorted” for the Natchez market?\r\nDoes no mournful heart among them yearn to the song of\r\n\r\n                  “O, carry me back to old Virginny”?\r\n\r\nStill further, we see in the same paper the following:\r\n\r\n                        SLAVES! SLAVES! SLAVES!\r\n\r\n  FRESH ARRIVALS WEEKLY.—Having established ourselves at the Forks of\r\n  the Road, near Natchez, for a term of years, we have now on hand,\r\n  and intend to keep throughout the entire year, a large and\r\n  well-selected stock of Negroes, consisting of field-hands, house\r\n  servants, mechanics, cooks, seamstresses, washers, ironers, etc.,\r\n  which we can and will sell as low or lower than any other house here\r\n  or in New Orleans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  Persons wishing to purchase would do well to call on us before\r\n  making purchases elsewhere, as our regular arrivals will keep us\r\n  supplied with a good and general assortment. Our terms are liberal.\r\n  Give us a call.\r\n\r\n                                                     GRIFFIN & PULLAM.\r\n\r\n  _Natchez, Oct. 15, 1852._—6m.\r\n\r\n  _Free Trader_ and _Concordia Intelligencer_ copy as above.\r\n\r\nIndeed! Messrs. Griffin and Pullam, it seems, are equally fortunate!\r\nThey are having fresh supplies weekly, and are going to keep a large,\r\nwell-selected stock constantly on hand, to wit, “field-hands,\r\nhouse-servants, mechanics, cooks, seamstresses, washers, ironers, etc.”\r\n\r\nLet us respectfully inquire what is the process by which a trader\r\nacquires a well-selected stock. He goes to Virginia to _select_. He has\r\nhad orders, say, for one dozen cooks, for half a dozen carpenters, for\r\nso many house-servants, &c. &c. Each one of these individuals have their\r\nown ties; besides being cooks, carpenters and house-servants, they are\r\nalso fathers, mothers, husbands, wives; but what of that? They must be\r\n_selected_—it is an _assortment_ that is wanted. The gentleman who has\r\nordered a cook does not, of course, want her five children; and the\r\nplanter who has ordered a carpenter does not want the cook, his wife. A\r\ncarpenter is an expensive article, at any rate, as they cost from a\r\nthousand to fifteen hundred dollars; and a man who has to pay out this\r\nsum for him cannot always afford himself the luxury of indulging his\r\nhumanity; and as to the children, they must be left in the slave-raising\r\nstate. For, when the ready-raised article is imported _weekly_ into\r\nNatchez or New Orleans, is it likely that the inhabitants will encumber\r\nthemselves with the labor of raising children? No, there must be\r\ndivision of labor in all well-ordered business. The northern slave\r\nstates raise the article, and the southern ones consume it.\r\n\r\nThe extracts have been taken from the papers of the more southern\r\nstates. If, now, the reader has any curiosity to explore the _selecting_\r\nprocess in the northern states, the daily prints will further enlighten\r\nhim. In the _Daily Virginian_ of Nov. 19, 1852, Mr. J. B. McLendon thus\r\nannounces to the Old Dominion that he has settled himself down to attend\r\nto the selecting process:\r\n\r\n                            NEGROEES WANTD.\r\n\r\n  The subscriber, having located in Lynchburg, is giving the highest\r\n  cash prices for negroes _between the ages of 10 and 30 years_. Those\r\n  having negroes for sale may find it to their interest to call on him\r\n  at the Washington Hotel, Lynchburg, or address him by letter.\r\n\r\n  All communications will receive prompt attention.\r\n\r\n                                                       J. B. MCLENDON.\r\n\r\n  Nov. 5-dly.\r\n\r\nMr. McLendon distinctly announces that he is not going to take any\r\nchildren under ten years of age, nor any grown people over thirty.\r\nLikely _young_ negroes are what he is after:—families, of course, never\r\nseparated!\r\n\r\nAgain, in the same paper, Mr. Seth Woodroof is desirous of keeping up\r\nthe recollection in the community that he also is in the market, as it\r\nwould appear he has been, some time past. He, likewise, wants negroes\r\nbetween ten and thirty years of age; but his views turn rather on\r\nmechanics, blacksmiths, and carpenters,—witness his hand:\r\n\r\n                            NEGROES WANTED.\r\n\r\n  The subscriber continues in market for Negroes, of both sexes,\r\n  _between the ages of 10 and 30_ years, including Mechanics, such as\r\n  Blacksmiths, Carpenters, and will pay the highest market prices in\r\n  cash. His office is a newly erected brick building on 1st or Lynch\r\n  street, immediately in rear of the Farmers’ Bank, where he is\r\n  prepared (having erected buildings with that view) to board negroes\r\n  sent to Lynchburg for sale or otherwise on as moderate terms, and\r\n  keep them as secure, as if they were placed in the jail of the\r\n  Corporation.\r\n\r\n  Aug 26.\r\n\r\n                                                        SETH WOODROOF.\r\n\r\nThere is no manner of doubt that this Mr. Seth Woodroof is a gentleman\r\nof humanity, and wishes to avoid the separation of families _as much as\r\npossible_. Doubtless he ardently wishes that all his blacksmiths and\r\ncarpenters would be considerate, and never have any children under ten\r\nyears of age; but, if the thoughtless dogs have got them, what’s a\r\nhumane man to do? He has to fill out Mr. This, That, and the Other’s\r\norder,—that’s a clear case; and therefore John and Sam must take their\r\nlast look at their babies, as Uncle Tom did of his when he stood by the\r\nrough trundle-bed and dropped into it great, useless tears.\r\n\r\nNay, my friends, don’t curse poor Mr. Seth Woodroof, because he does the\r\nhorrible, loathsome work of tearing up the living human heart, to make\r\ntwine and shoe-strings for you! It’s disagreeable business enough, he\r\nwill tell you, sometimes; and, if you must have him to do it for you,\r\ntreat him civilly, and don’t pretend that you are any better than he.\r\n\r\nBut the good trade is not confined to the Old Dominion, by any means.\r\nSee the following extract from a Tennessee paper, the _Nashville\r\nGazette_, Nov. 23, 1852, where Mr. A. A. McLean, general agent in this\r\nkind of business, thus makes known his wants and intentions:\r\n\r\n                                WANTED.\r\n\r\n  I want to purchase immediately 25 likely NEGROES,—male and\r\n  female,—_between the ages of 15 and 25 years_; for which I will pay\r\n  the highest price in cash.\r\n\r\n                                    A. A. MCLEAN, _General Agent_,\r\n                                                      _Cherry Street_.\r\n\r\n  Nov. 9\r\n\r\nMr. McLean, it seems, only wants those between the ages of fifteen and\r\ntwenty-five. This advertisement is twice repeated in the same paper,\r\nfrom which fact we may conjecture that the gentleman is very much in\r\nearnest in his wants, and entertains rather confident expectations that\r\nsomebody will be willing to sell. Further, the same gentleman states\r\nanother want.\r\n\r\n                                WANTED.\r\n\r\n  I want to purchase, immediately, a Negro man, Carpenter, and will\r\n  give a good price.\r\n\r\n  Sept. 29\r\n\r\n                                          A. A. MCLEAN, _Gen’l Agent_.\r\n\r\nMr. McLean does not advertise for his wife and children, or where this\r\nsame carpenter is to be sent,—whether to the New Orleans market, or up\r\nthe Red River, or off to some far bayou of the Mississippi, never to\r\nlook upon wife or child again. But, again, Mr. McLean in the same paper\r\ntells us of another want:\r\n\r\n                          WANTED IMMEDIATELY.\r\n\r\n  A Wet Nurse. Any price will be given for one of good character,\r\n  constitution, &c. Apply to\r\n\r\n                                          A. A. MCLEAN, _Gen’l Agent_.\r\n\r\nAnd what is to be done with the baby of this wet nurse? Perhaps, at the\r\nmoment that Mr. McLean is advertising for her, she is hushing the little\r\nthing in her bosom, and thinking, as many another mother has done, that\r\nit is about the brightest, prettiest little baby that ever was born;\r\nfor, singularly enough, even black mothers do fall into this delusion\r\nsometimes. No matter for all this,—she is wanted for a wet nurse! Aunt\r\nPrue can take her baby, and _raise it_ on corn-cake, and what not. Off\r\nwith her to Mr. McLean!\r\n\r\nSee, also, the following advertisement of the good State of Alabama,\r\nwhich shows how the trade is thriving there. Mr. S. N. Brown, in the\r\n_Advertiser and Gazette_, Montgomery, Alabama, holds forth as follows:\r\n\r\n                           NEGROES FOR SALE.\r\n\r\n  S. N. BROWN takes this method of informing his old patrons, and\r\n  others waiting to purchase Slaves, that he has now on hand, of his\r\n  own selection and purchasing, a lot of likely young _Negroes_,\r\n  consisting of Men, Boys, and Women, Field Hands, and superior House\r\n  Servants, which he offers and will sell as low as the times will\r\n  warrant. Office on Market-street, above the Montgomery Hall, at\r\n  Lindsay’s Old Stand, where he intends to keep slaves for sale on his\r\n  own account, and not on commission,—therefore thinks he can give\r\n  satisfaction to those who patronize him.\r\n\r\n  _Montgomery, Ala., Sept. 13, 1852._      twtf (J)\r\n\r\nWhere were these boys and girls of Mr. Brown _selected_, let us ask. How\r\ndid their fathers and mothers feel when they were “_selected_”? Emmeline\r\nwas taken out of one family, and George out of another. The judicious\r\ntrader has travelled through wide regions of country, leaving in his\r\ntrack wailing and anguish. A little incident, which has recently been\r\nthe rounds of the papers, may perhaps illustrate some of the scenes he\r\nhas occasioned:\r\n\r\n                          INCIDENT OF SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n  A negro woman belonging to Geo. M. Garrison, of Polk Co., killed\r\n  four of her children, by cutting their throats while they were\r\n  asleep, on Thursday night, the 2d inst., and then put an end to her\r\n  own existence by cutting her throat. Her master knows of no cause\r\n  for the horrid act, unless it be that she heard him speak of selling\r\n  her and two of her children, and keeping the others.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty of the master in this case is edifying. He knows that\r\nnegroes cannot be expected to have the feelings of cultivated\r\npeople;—and yet, here is a case where the creature really acts\r\nunaccountably, and he can’t think of any cause except that he was going\r\nto sell her from her children.\r\n\r\nBut, compose yourself, dear reader; there was no great harm done. These\r\nwere all _poor_ people’s children, and some of them, though not all,\r\nwere black; and that makes all the difference in the world, you know!\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Brown is not alone in Montgomery. Mr. J. W. Lindsey wishes to\r\nremind the people of his dépôt.\r\n\r\n                         100 NEGROES FOR SALE.\r\n\r\n  At my depot, on Commerce-street, immediately between the Exchange\r\n  Hotel and F. M. Gilmer, Jr.’s Warehouse, where I will be receiving,\r\n  from time to time, large lots of Negroes during the season, and will\r\n  sell on as accommodating terms as any house in this city. I would\r\n  respectfully request my old customers and friends to call and\r\n  examine my stock.\r\n\r\n                                                      JNO. W. LINDSEY.\r\n\r\n  _Montgomery, Nov. 2, 1852._\r\n\r\nMr. Lindsey is going to be receiving, from time to time, all the season,\r\nand will sell as cheap as anybody; so there’s no fear of the supply’s\r\nfalling off. And, lo! in the same paper, Messrs. Sanders & Foster press\r\ntheir claims also on the public notice.\r\n\r\n                           NEGROES FOR SALE.\r\n\r\n  The undersigned have bought out the well-known establishment of\r\n  Eckles & Brown, where they have now on hand a large lot of likely\r\n  young Negroes, to wit: Men, Women, Boys and Girls, good field-hands.\r\n  Also, several good House Servants and Mechanics of all kinds. The\r\n  subscribers intend to keep constantly on hand a large assortment of\r\n  Negroes, comprising every description. Persons wishing to purchase\r\n  will find it much to their interest to call and examine previous to\r\n  buying elsewhere.\r\n\r\n                                                     SANDERS & FOSTER.\r\n\r\n  _April 13._\r\n\r\nMessrs. Sanders & Foster are going to have an _assortment_ also. All\r\ntheir negroes are to be young and likely; the trashy old fathers and\r\nmothers are all thrown aside like a heap of pig-weed, after one has been\r\nweeding a garden.\r\n\r\nQuery: Are these Messrs. Sanders & Foster, and J. W. Lindsey, and S. N.\r\nBrown, and McLean, and Woodroof, and McLendon, all members of the\r\nchurch, in good and regular standing? Does the question shock you? Why\r\nso? Why should they not be? The Rev. Dr. Smylie, of Mississippi, in a\r\ndocument endorsed by two presbyteries, says distinctly that the Bible\r\ngives a right to buy and sell slaves.[19]\r\n\r\nIf the Bible guarantees this right, and sanctions this trade, why should\r\nit shock you to see the slave-trader at the communion-table? Do you feel\r\nthat there is blood on his hands,—the blood of human hearts, which he\r\nhas torn asunder? Do you shudder when he touches the communion-bread,\r\nand when he drinks the cup which “whosoever drinketh unworthily drinketh\r\ndamnation to himself”? But who makes the trader? Do not you? Do you\r\nthink that the trader’s profession is a healthy one for the soul? Do you\r\nthink the scenes with which he must be familiar, and the deeds he must\r\ndo, in order to keep up an _assortment_ of negroes for your convenience,\r\nare such things as Jesus Christ approves? Do you think they tend to\r\npromote his growth in grace, and to secure his soul’s salvation? Or is\r\nit so important for you to have _assorted_ negroes that the traders must\r\nnot only be turned out of good society in this life, but run the risk of\r\ngoing to hell forever, for your accommodation?\r\n\r\nBut let us search the Southern papers, and see if we cannot find some\r\nevidence of that humanity which avoids the separation of families, _as\r\nfar as possible_. In the _Argus_, published at Weston, Missouri, Nov. 5,\r\n1852, see the following:\r\n\r\n                           A NEGRO FOR SALE.\r\n\r\n  I wish to sell a black girl about 24 years old, a good cook and\r\n  washer, handy with a needle, can spin and weave. I wish to sell her\r\n  in the neighborhood of Camden Point; if not sold there in a short\r\n  time, I will hunt the best market; or I will trade her for two small\r\n  ones, a boy and girl.\r\n\r\n                                                             M. DOYAL.\r\n\r\nConsiderate Mr. Doyal! He is opposed to the separation of families, and,\r\ntherefore, wishes to sell this woman in the neighborhood of Camden\r\nPoint, where her family ties are,—perhaps her husband and children, her\r\nbrothers or sisters. He will not separate her from her family if it is\r\npossible to avoid it; that is to say, if he can get as much for her\r\nwithout; but, if he can’t, he will “_hunt the best market_.” What more\r\nwould you have of Mr. Doyal?\r\n\r\nHow speeds the blessed trade in the State of Maryland?—Let us take the\r\n_Baltimore Sun_ of Nov. 23, 1852.\r\n\r\nMr. J. S. Donovan thus advertises the Christian public of the\r\naccommodations of his jail:\r\n\r\n                           CASH FOR NEGROES.\r\n\r\n  The undersigned continues, at his old stand, No. 13 CAMDEN ST., to\r\n  pay the highest price for NEGROES. Persons bringing Negroes by\r\n  railroad or steamboat will find it very convenient to secure their\r\n  Negroes, as my Jail is adjoining the Railroad Depot and near the\r\n  Steamboat Landings. Negroes received for safe keeping.\r\n\r\n                                                        J. S. DONOVAN.\r\n\r\nMessrs. B. M. & W. L. Campbell, in the respectable old stand of Slatter,\r\nadvertise as follows:\r\n\r\n                             SLAVES WANTED.\r\n\r\n  We are at all times purchasing SLAVES, paying the highest cash\r\n  prices. Persons wishing to sell will please call at 242 PRATT ST.\r\n  (Slatter’s old stand). Communications attended to.\r\n\r\n                                               B. M. & W. L. CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\nIn another column, however, Mr. John Denning has his season\r\nadvertisement, in terms which border on the sublime:\r\n\r\n                          5000 NEGROES WANTED.\r\n\r\n  I will pay the highest prices, in cash, for 5000 NEGROES, with good\r\n  titles, slaves for life or for a term of years, in large or small\r\n  families, or single negroes. I will also purchase Negroes restricted\r\n  to remain in the State, that sustain good characters. Families never\r\n  separated. Persons having Slaves for sale will please call and see\r\n  me, as I am always in the market with the cash. Communications\r\n  promptly attended to, and liberal commissions paid, by JOHN N.\r\n  DENNING, No. 18 S. Frederick street, between Baltimore and Second\r\n  streets, Baltimore, Maryland. Trees in front of the house.\r\n\r\nMr. John Denning, also, is a man of humanity. He never separates\r\nfamilies. Don’t you see it in his advertisement? If a man offers him a\r\nwife without her husband, Mr. John Denning won’t buy her. O, no! His\r\nfive thousand are all unbroken families; he never takes any other; and\r\nhe transports them whole and entire. This is a comfort to reflect upon,\r\ncertainly.\r\n\r\nSee, also, the _Democrat_, published in Cambridge, Maryland, Dec. 8,\r\n1852. A gentleman gives this pictorial representation of himself, with\r\nthe proclamation to the slave-holders of Dorchester and adjacent\r\ncounties that he is again in the market:\r\n\r\n                            NEGROES WANTED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  I wish to inform the slave-holders of Dorchester and the adjacent\r\n  counties that I am again in the Market. Persons having negroes that\r\n  are slaves for life to dispose of will find it to their interest to\r\n  see me before they sell, as I am determined to pay the highest\r\n  prices in cash that the Southern market will justify. I can be found\r\n  at A. Hall’s Hotel in Easton, where I will remain until the first\r\n  day of July next. Communications addressed to me at Easton, or\r\n  information given to Wm. Bell in Cambridge, will meet with prompt\r\n  attention.\r\n\r\n                                                           WM. HARKER.\r\n\r\nMr. Harker is very accommodating. He keeps himself informed as to the\r\nstate of the southern market, and will give the very highest price that\r\nit will justify. Moreover, he will be on hand till July, and will answer\r\nany letters from the adjoining country on the subject. On one point he\r\nought to be spoken to. He has not advertised that he does not separate\r\nfamilies. It is a mere matter of taste, to be sure; but then some\r\nwell-disposed people like to see it on a trader’s card, thinking it has\r\na more creditable appearance; and probably, Mr. Harker, if he reflects a\r\nlittle, will put it in next time. It takes up very little room, and\r\nmakes a good appearance.\r\n\r\nWe are occasionally reminded, by the advertisements for runaways, to how\r\nsmall an extent it is found _possible to avoid_ the separation of\r\nfamilies: as in the _Richmond Whig_ of Nov. 5, 1852:\r\n\r\n                              $10 REWARD.\r\n\r\n  We are requested by Henry P. Davis to offer a reward of $10 for the\r\n  apprehension of a negro man named HENRY, who ran away from the said\r\n  Davis’ farm near Petersburg, on Thursday, the 27th October. Said\r\n  slave came from near Lynchburg, Va., purchased of —— Cock, and has a\r\n  wife in Halifax county, Va. He has recently been employed on the\r\n  South Side Railroad. He may be in the neighborhood of his wife.\r\n\r\n                                  PULLIAM & DAVIS, _Aucts., Richmond_.\r\n\r\nIt seems to strike the advertiser as _possible_ that Henry may be in the\r\nneighborhood of his wife. We should not at all wonder if he were.\r\n\r\nThe reader, by this time, is in possession of some of those statistics\r\nof which the South Carolinian speaks, when he says,\r\n\r\n  We feel confident, if statistics could be had, to throw light upon\r\n  the subject, we should find that there is less separation of\r\n  families among the negroes than occurs with almost any other class\r\n  of persons.\r\n\r\nIn order to give some little further idea of the extent to which this\r\nkind of property is continually changing hands, see the following\r\ncalculation, which has been made from sixty-four Southern newspapers,\r\ntaken very much at random. The papers were all published in the last two\r\nweeks of the month of November, 1852.\r\n\r\nThe negroes are advertised sometimes by name, sometimes in definite\r\nnumbers, and sometimes in “lots,” “assortments,” and other indefinite\r\nterms. We present the result of this estimate, far as it must fall from\r\na fair representation of the facts, in a tabular form.\r\n\r\nHere is recorded, in _only eleven papers_, the sale of eight hundred\r\nforty-nine slaves in _two weeks_ in Virginia; the state where Mr. J.\r\nThornton Randolph describes such an event as a separation of families\r\nbeing a thing that “we read of in _novels_ sometimes.”\r\n\r\n          ────────────┬──────────┬───────────┬─────┬──────────\r\n          States where│  No. of  │  No. of   │ No. │  No. of\r\n           published. │  Papers  │  Negroes  │ of  │ Runaways\r\n                      │consulted.│advertised.│Lots.│described.\r\n          ────────────┼──────────┼───────────┼─────┼──────────\r\n          Virginia,   │        11│        849│    7│        15\r\n          Kentucky,   │         5│        238│    1│         7\r\n          Tennessee,  │         8│        385│    4│        17\r\n          S.

Verily, we must apply to the\r\nnewspapers of his state the same language which he applies to “Uncle\r\nTom’s Cabin:” “Were our views of the system of slavery to be derived\r\nfrom _these papers_, we should regard the families of slaves as utterly\r\nunsettled and vagrant.”\r\n\r\nThe total, in _sixty-four papers_, in different states, for only two\r\nweeks, is four thousand one hundred, besides ninety-two _lots_, as they\r\nare called.\r\n\r\nAnd now, who is he who compares the hopeless, returnless separation of\r\nthe negro from his family, to the voluntary separation of the freeman,\r\nwhom necessary business interest takes for a while from the bosom of his\r\nfamily? Is not the lot of the slave bitter enough, without this last of\r\nmockeries and worst of insults? Well may they say, in their anguish,\r\n“Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of them that are at\r\nease, and with the contempt of the proud!”\r\n\r\nFrom the poor negro, exposed to bitterest separation, the law jealously\r\ntakes away the power of writing. For him the gulf of separation yawns\r\nblack and hopeless, with no redeeming signal. Ignorant of geography, he\r\nknows not whither he is going, or where he is, or how to direct a\r\nletter. To all intents and purposes, it is a separation hopeless as that\r\nof death, and as final.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  Article in _Fraser’s Magazine_ for October, by a South Carolinian.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  “If language can convey a clear and definite meaning at all, I know\r\n  not how it can more unequivocally or more plainly present to the mind\r\n  any thought or idea than the twenty-fifth chapter of Leviticus clearly\r\n  or unequivocally establishes the fact that slavery or bondage was\r\n  sanctioned by God himself; and that ‘_buying, selling, holding and\r\n  bequeathing_’ slaves, as property, are regulations which were\r\n  established by himself.”—_Smylie on Slavery._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n                            THE SLAVE-TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it that constitutes the vital force of the institution of\r\nslavery in this country? Slavery, being an unnatural and unhealthful\r\ncondition of society, being a most wasteful and impoverishing mode of\r\ncultivating the soil, would speedily run itself out in a community, and\r\nbecome so unprofitable as to fall into disuse, were it not kept alive by\r\nsome unnatural process.\r\n\r\nWhat has that process been in America? Why has that healing course of\r\nnature which cured this awful wound in all the northern states stopped\r\nshort on Mason & Dixon’s line? In Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and\r\nKentucky, slave labor long ago impoverished the soil almost beyond\r\nrecovery, and became entirely unprofitable. In all these states it is\r\nwell known that the question of emancipation has been urgently\r\npresented. It has been discussed in legislatures, and Southern men have\r\npoured forth on the institution of slavery such anathemas as only\r\nSouthern men can pour forth. All that has ever been said of it at the\r\nNorth has been said in four-fold thunders in these Southern discussions.\r\nThe State of Kentucky once came within one vote, in her legislature, of\r\ntaking measures for gradual emancipation. The State of Virginia has come\r\nalmost equally near, and Maryland has long been waiting at the door.\r\nThere was a time when no one doubted that all these states would soon be\r\nfree states; and what is now the reason that they are not? Why are these\r\ndiscussions now silenced, and why does this noble determination now\r\nretrograde? The answer is in a word. It is the extension of slave\r\nterritory, the opening of a great southern slave-market, and the\r\norganization of a great internal slave-trade, that has arrested the\r\nprogress of emancipation.\r\n\r\nWhile these states were beginning to look upon the slave as one who\r\nmight possibly yet become a man, while they meditated giving to him and\r\nhis wife and children the inestimable blessings of liberty, this great\r\nsouthern slave-mart was opened. It began by the addition of Missouri as\r\nslave territory, and the votes of two Northern men were those which\r\ndecided this great question. Then, by the assent and concurrence of\r\nNorthern men, came in all the immense acquisition of slave territory\r\nwhich now opens so boundless a market to tempt the avarice and cupidity\r\nof the northern slave-raising states.\r\n\r\nThis acquisition of territory has deferred perhaps for indefinite ages\r\nthe emancipation of a race. It has condemned to sorrow and\r\nheart-breaking separation, to groans and wailings, hundreds of thousands\r\nof slave families; it has built, through all the Southern States,\r\nslave-warehouses, with all their ghastly furnishings of gags, and\r\nthumb-screws, and cowhides; it has organized unnumbered slave-coffles,\r\nclanking their chains and filing in mournful march through this land of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nThis accession of slave territory hardened the heart of the master. It\r\nchanged what was before, in comparison, a kindly relation, into the most\r\nhorrible and inhuman of trades.\r\n\r\nThe planter whose slaves had grown up around him, and whom he had\r\nlearned to look upon almost as men and women, saw on every sable\r\nforehead now nothing but its market value. This man was a thousand\r\ndollars, and this eight hundred. The black baby in its mother’s arms was\r\na hundred-dollar bill, and nothing more. All those nobler traits of mind\r\nand heart which should have made the slave a brother became only so many\r\nstamps on his merchandise. Is the slave intelligent?—Good! that raises\r\nhis price two hundred dollars. Is he conscientious and faithful?—Good!\r\nstamp it down in his certificate; it’s worth two hundred dollars more.\r\nIs he religious? Does that Holy Spirit of God, whose name we mention\r\nwith reverence and fear, make that despised form His temple?—Let that\r\nalso be put down in the estimate of his market value, and the gift of\r\nthe Holy Ghost shall be sold for money. Is he a minister of\r\nGod?—Nevertheless, he has his price in the market. From the church and\r\nfrom the communion-table the Christian brother and sister are taken to\r\nmake up the slave-coffle. And woman, with her tenderness, her\r\ngentleness, her beauty,—woman, to whom mixed blood of the black and the\r\nwhite have given graces perilous for a slave,—what is her accursed lot,\r\nin this dreadful commerce?—The next few chapters will disclose facts on\r\nthis subject which ought to wring the heart of every Christian mother,\r\nif, indeed, she be worthy of that holiest name.\r\n\r\nBut we will not deal in assertions merely. We have stated the thing to\r\nbe proved; let us show the facts which prove it.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this fearful traffic is known to many,—the particulars\r\nand dreadful extent of it realized but by few.\r\n\r\nLet us enter a little more particularly on them. The slave-exporting\r\nstates are Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee and\r\nMissouri. These are slave-raising states, and the others are\r\nslave-consuming states. We have shown, in the preceding chapters, the\r\nkind of advertisements which are usual in those states; but, as we wish\r\nto produce on the minds of our readers something of the impression which\r\nhas been produced on our own mind by their multiplicity and abundance,\r\nwe shall add a few more here.

JAMES.\r\n\r\nThe slave-raising business of the northern states has been variously\r\nalluded to and recognized, both in the business statistics of the\r\nstates, and occasionally in the speeches of patriotic men, who have\r\njustly mourned over it as a degradation to their country. In 1841, the\r\nBritish and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society addressed to the executive\r\ncommittee of the American Anti-Slavery Society some inquiries on the\r\ninternal American slave-trade.\r\n\r\nA labored investigation was made at that time, the results of which were\r\npublished in London; and from that volume are made the following\r\nextracts:\r\n\r\n  The _Virginia Times_ (a weekly newspaper, published at Wheeling,\r\n  Virginia) estimates, in 1836, the number of slaves exported for sale\r\n  from that state alone, during “the twelve months preceding,” at\r\n  _forty thousand_, the aggregate value of whom is computed at\r\n  twenty-four millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n  Allowing for Virginia one-half of the whole exportation during the\r\n  period in question, and we have the appalling sum total of _eighty\r\n  thousand slaves_ exported in a single year from the breeding states.\r\n  We cannot decide with certainty what proportion of the above number\r\n  was furnished by each of the breeding states, but Maryland ranks\r\n  next to Virginia in point of numbers, North Carolina follows\r\n  Maryland, Kentucky, North Carolina, then Tennessee and Delaware.\r\n\r\n  The _Natchez_ (Mississippi) _Courier_ says “that the States of\r\n  Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas, imported _two hundred\r\n  and fifty thousand_ slaves from the more northern states in the year\r\n  1836.”\r\n\r\n  This seems absolutely incredible, but it probably includes all the\r\n  slaves introduced by the immigration of their masters. The\r\n  following, from the _Virginia Times_, confirms this supposition. In\r\n  the same paragraph which is referred to under the second query, it\r\n  is said:\r\n\r\n  “We have heard intelligent men estimate the number of slaves\r\n  exported from Virginia, within the last twelve months, at a hundred\r\n  and twenty thousand, each slave averaging at least six hundred\r\n  dollars, making an aggregate of seventy-two million dollars. Of the\r\n  number of slaves exported, not more than _one-third_ have been sold;\r\n  the others having been carried by their masters, who have removed.”\r\n\r\n  Assuming one-third to be the proportion of the sold, there are more\r\n  than eighty thousand imported for sale into the four States of\r\n  Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas. Supposing one-half of\r\n  eighty thousand to be sold into the other buying states,—S.\r\n  Carolina, Georgia, and the territory of Florida,—and we are brought\r\n  to the conclusion that more than a hundred and twenty thousand\r\n  slaves were, for some years previous to the great pecuniary pressure\r\n  in 1837, exported from the breeding to the consuming states.\r\n\r\n  The _Baltimore American_ gives the following from a Mississippi\r\n  paper of 1837:\r\n\r\n  “The report made by the committee of the citizens of Mobile,\r\n  appointed at their meeting held on the 1st instant; on the subject\r\n  of the existing pecuniary pressure, states that so large has been\r\n  the return of slave labor, that purchases by Alabama of that species\r\n  of property from other states, since 1833, have amounted to about\r\n  _ten million dollars annually_.”\r\n\r\n  “Dealing in slaves,” says the _Baltimore_ (Maryland) _Register_ of\r\n  1829, “has become a large business; establishments are made in\r\n  several places in Maryland and Virginia, at which they are sold like\r\n  cattle. These places of deposit are strongly built, and well\r\n  supplied with iron thumb-screws and gags, and ornamented with\r\n  cowskins and other whips, oftentimes bloody.”\r\n\r\n  Professor Dew, now President of the University of William and Mary,\r\n  in Virginia, in his review of the debate in the Virginia legislature\r\n  in 1831–2, says (p. 120):\r\n\r\n  “A full equivalent being left in the place of the slave (the\r\n  purchase-money), this emigration becomes an advantage to the state,\r\n  and does not check the black population as much as at first view we\r\n  might imagine; because it furnishes every inducement to the master\r\n  to attend to the negroes, _to encourage breeding, and to cause the\r\n  greatest number possible to be raised_.” Again: “_Virginia is, in\r\n  fact, a negro-raising state for the other states._”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Goode, of Virginia, in his speech before the Virginia\r\n  legislature, in January, 1832, said:\r\n\r\n  “The superior usefulness of the slaves in the South will constitute\r\n  an _effectual demand_, which will remove them from our limits. We\r\n  shall send them from our state, because it will be _our interest_ to\r\n  do so. But gentlemen are alarmed _lest the markets of other states_\r\n  be closed against the introduction of our slaves. Sir, the demand\r\n  for _slave labor must increase,” &c._\r\n\r\n  In the debates of the Virginia Convention, in 1829, Judge Upshur\r\n  said:\r\n\r\n  “The value of slaves as an article of property depends much on the\r\n  state of the market abroad. In this view, it is the value of land\r\n  _abroad_, and not of land here, which furnishes the ratio. Nothing\r\n  is more fluctuating than the value of slaves. A late law of\r\n  Louisiana reduced their value twenty-five per cent. in two hours\r\n  after its passage was known. _If it should be our lot, as I trust it\r\n  will be, to acquire the country of Texas, their price will rise\r\n  again._”\r\n\r\n  Hon. Philip Doddridge, of Virginia, in his speech in the Virginia\r\n  Convention, in 1829 (Debates p. 89), said:\r\n\r\n  “The acquisition of Texas will greatly enhance the value of the\r\n  property in question (Virginia slaves).”\r\n\r\n  Rev. Dr. Graham, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, at a Colonization\r\n  meeting held at that place in the fall of 1837, said:\r\n\r\n  “There were nearly seven thousand slaves offered in New Orleans\r\n  market, last winter. From Virginia alone six thousand were annually\r\n  sent to the South, and from Virginia and North Carolina there had\r\n  gone to the South, in the last twenty years, THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND\r\n  SLAVES.”\r\n\r\n  Hon. Henry Clay, of Kentucky, in his speech before the Colonization\r\n  Society, in 1829, says:\r\n\r\n  “It is believed that nowhere in the farming portion of the United\r\n  States would slave labor be generally employed, if the proprietor\r\n  were not tempted to _raise slaves by the high price of the southern\r\n  markets_, which keeps it up in his own.”\r\n\r\n  The _New York Journal of Commerce_ of October 12th, 1835, contains a\r\n  letter from a Virginian, whom the editor calls “a very good and\r\n  sensible man,” asserting that _twenty thousand_ slaves had been\r\n  driven to the South from Virginia that year, but little more than\r\n  three-fourths of which had then elapsed.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Gholson, of Virginia, in his speech in the legislature of that\r\n  state, January 18, 1831 (see _Richmond Whig_), says:\r\n\r\n  “It has always (perhaps erroneously) been considered, by steady and\r\n  old-fashioned people, that the owner of land had a reasonable right\r\n  to its annual profits; the owner of orchards to their annual fruits;\r\n  the owner of brood mares to their product; and the owner of _female\r\n  slaves to their increase_. We have not the fine-spun intelligence\r\n  nor legal acumen to discover the technical distinctions drawn by\r\n  gentlemen (that is, the distinction between _female slaves_ and\r\n  _brood mares_). The legal maxim of _partus sequitur ventrem_ is\r\n  coëval with the existence of the right of property itself, and is\r\n  founded in wisdom and justice. It is on the justice and\r\n  inviolability of this maxim that the master foregoes the service of\r\n  the female slave, has her nursed and attended during the period of\r\n  her gestation, and raises the helpless infant offspring. The value\r\n  of the property _justifies the expense_, and I do not hesitate to\r\n  say that in its _increase consists much of our wealth_.”\r\n\r\nCan any comment on the state of public sentiment produced by slavery\r\nequal the simple reading of this extract, if we remember that it was\r\nspoken in the Virginia legislature? One would think the cold cheek of\r\nWashington would redden in its grave for shame, that his native state\r\nhad sunk so low. That there were Virginian hearts to feel this disgrace\r\nis evident from the following reply of Mr. Faulkner to Mr. Gholson, in\r\nthe Virginia House of Delegates, 1832. See _Richmond Whig_:\r\n\r\n  “But he (Mr. Gholson) has labored to show that the abolition of\r\n  slavery would be impolitic, because your slaves constitute the\r\n  entire wealth of the state, all _the productive capacity_ Virginia\r\n  possesses; and, sir, as things are, _I believe he is correct_. He\r\n  says that the slaves constitute the entire available wealth of\r\n  Eastern Virginia. Is it true that for two hundred years the only\r\n  increase in the wealth and resources of Virginia has been a remnant\r\n  of the natural increase of this miserable race? Can it be that on\r\n  this increase she places her sole dependence? Until I heard these\r\n  declarations, I had not fully conceived the horrible extent of this\r\n  evil. These gentlemen state the fact, which the history and _present\r\n  aspect of the commonwealth_ but too well sustain. What, sir! have\r\n  you lived for two hundred years without personal effort or\r\n  productive industry, in extravagance and indolence, sustained alone\r\n  by the return from the sales of the increase of slaves, and\r\n  retaining merely such a number as your now impoverished lands can\r\n  sustain as STOCK?”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Thomas Jefferson Randolph in the Virginia legislature used the\r\n  following language (_Liberty Bell_, p. 20):\r\n\r\n  “I agree with gentlemen in the necessity of arming the state for\r\n  internal defence. I will unite with them in any effort to restore\r\n  confidence to the public mind, and to conduce to the sense of the\r\n  safety of our wives and our children. Yet, sir, I must ask upon whom\r\n  is to fall the burden of this defence? Not upon the lordly masters\r\n  of their hundred slaves, who will never turn out except to retire\r\n  with their families when danger threatens. No, sir; it is to fall\r\n  upon the _less wealthy class of our citizens, chiefly upon_ the\r\n  non-slaveholder. I have known patrols turned out where _there was\r\n  not a slave-holder among them_; and this is the practice of the\r\n  country. I have slept in times of alarm quiet in bed, without having\r\n  a thought of care, while these individuals, owning none of this\r\n  property themselves, were patrolling under a compulsory process, for\r\n  a pittance of seventy-five cents per twelve hours, the very\r\n  curtilage of my house, and guarding that property which was alike\r\n  dangerous to them and myself. After all, this is but an expedient.\r\n  As this population becomes more numerous, it becomes less\r\n  productive. Your guard must be increased, until finally its profits\r\n  will not pay for the expense of its subjection. Slavery has the\r\n  effect of lessening the free population of a country.\r\n\r\n  “The gentleman has spoken of the increase of the female slaves being\r\n  a part of the profit. It is admitted; but no great evil can be\r\n  averted, no good attained, without some inconvenience. It may be\r\n  questioned how far it is desirable to foster and encourage this\r\n  branch of profit. It is a practice, and an increasing practice, in\r\n  parts of Virginia, to rear slaves for market. How can an honorable\r\n  mind, a patriot, and a lover of his country, bear to see this\r\n  Ancient Dominion, rendered illustrious by the noble devotion and\r\n  patriotism of her sons in the cause of liberty, converted into one\r\n  grand menagerie, where men are to be reared for the market, like\r\n  oxen for the shambles? Is it better, is it not worse, than the\r\n  slave-trade;—that trade which enlisted the labor of the good and\r\n  wise of every creed, and every clime, to abolish it? The trader\r\n  receives the slave, a stranger in language, aspect and manners, from\r\n  the merchant who has brought him from the interior. The ties of\r\n  father, mother, husband and child, have all been rent in twain;\r\n  before he receives him, his soul has become callous. But here, sir,\r\n  individuals whom the master has known from infancy, whom he has seen\r\n  sporting in the innocent gambols of childhood, who have been\r\n  accustomed to look to him for protection, he tears from the mother’s\r\n  arms, and sells into a strange country, among strange people,\r\n  subject to cruel taskmasters.\r\n\r\n  “He has attempted to justify slavery here because it exists in\r\n  Africa, and has stated that it exists all over the world. Upon the\r\n  same principle, he could justify Mahometanism, with its plurality of\r\n  wives, petty wars for plunder, robbery and murder, or any other of\r\n  the abominations and enormities of savage tribes. Does slavery exist\r\n  in any part of civilized Europe?—No sir, in no part of it.”\r\n\r\nThe calculations in the volume from which we have been quoting were made\r\nin the year 1841. Since that time, the area of the southern slave-market\r\nhas been doubled, and the trade has undergone a proportional increase.\r\nSouthern papers are full of its advertisements. It is, in fact, the\r\ngreat trade of the country. From the single port of Baltimore, in the\r\nlast two years, a thousand and thirty-three slaves have been shipped to\r\nthe southern market, as is apparent from the following report of the\r\ncustom-house officer:\r\n\r\n ABSTRACT OF THE NUMBER OF VESSELS CLEARED IN THE DISTRICT OF BALTIMORE\r\n    FOR SOUTHERN PORTS, HAVING SLAVES ON BOARD, FROM JAN. 1, 1851, TO\r\n                           NOVEMBER 20, 1852.\r\n\r\n ────────┬──────────────┬────────────────────┬──────────────────┬───────\r\n  Date.  │ Denomina’s.  │ Names of Vessels.  │   Where Bound.   │ Nos.\r\n ────────┼──────────────┼────────────────────┼──────────────────┼───────\r\n   1851  │              │                    │                  │\r\n Jan.   6│Sloop,        │Georgia,            │Norfolk, Va.      │     16\r\n Jan.  10│Sloop,        │Georgia,            │Norfolk, Va.      │      6\r\n Jan.  11│Bark,         │Elizabeth,          │New Orleans.      │     92\r\n Jan.  14│Sloop,        │Georgia,            │Norfolk, Va.      │      9\r\n Jan.  17│Sloop,        │Georgia,            │Norfolk, Va.      │      6\r\n Jan.  20│Bark,         │Cora,               │New Orleans.      │     14\r\n Feb.   6│Bark,         │E.

But this\r\nis only one port, and only one mode of exporting; for multitudes of them\r\nare sent in coffles over land; and yet Mr. J. Thornton Randolph\r\nrepresents the negroes of Virginia as living in pastoral security,\r\nsmoking their pipes under their own vines and fig-trees, the venerable\r\npatriarch of the flock declaring that “he nebber hab hear such a ting as\r\na nigger sold to Georgia all his life, unless dat nigger did someting\r\nvery bad.”\r\n\r\nAn affecting picture of the consequences of this traffic upon both\r\nmaster and slave is drawn by the committee of the volume from which we\r\nhave quoted.\r\n\r\nThe writer cannot conclude this chapter better than by the language\r\nwhich they have used.\r\n\r\n  This system bears with extreme severity upon the slave. It subjects\r\n  him to a perpetual fear of being sold to the “soul-driver,” which to\r\n  the slave is the realization of all conceivable woes and horrors,\r\n  more dreaded than death. An awful apprehension of this fate haunts\r\n  the poor sufferer by day and by night, from his cradle to his grave.\r\n  SUSPENSE hangs like a thunder-cloud over his head. He knows that\r\n  there is not a passing hour, whether he wakes or sleeps, which may\r\n  not be THE LAST that he shall spend with his wife and children.\r\n  Every day or week some acquaintance is snatched from his side, and\r\n  thus the consciousness of his own danger is kept continually awake.\r\n  “Surely my turn will come next,” is his harrowing conviction; for he\r\n  knows that he was reared for this, as the ox for the yoke, or the\r\n  sheep for the slaughter. In this aspect, the slave’s condition is\r\n  truly indescribable. _Suspense_, even when it relates to an event of\r\n  no great moment, and “endureth but for a night,” is hard to bear.\r\n  But when it broods over all, absolutely all that is dear, chilling\r\n  the present with its deep shade, and casting its awful gloom over\r\n  the future, it _must_ break the heart! Such is the suspense under\r\n  which every slave in the breeding states lives. It poisons all his\r\n  little lot of bliss. If a father, he cannot go forth to his toil\r\n  without bidding a mental farewell to his wife and children. He\r\n  cannot return, weary and worn, from the field, with any certainty\r\n  that he shall not find his home robbed and desolate. Nor can he seek\r\n  his bed of straw and rags without the frightful misgiving that his\r\n  wife may be torn from his arms before morning. Should a white\r\n  stranger approach his master’s mansion, he fears that the\r\n  _soul-driver_ has come, and awaits in terror the overseer’s mandate,\r\n  “You are sold; follow that man.” There is no being on earth whom the\r\n  slaves of the breeding states regard with so much horror as the\r\n  _trader_. He is to them what the prowling kidnapper is to their less\r\n  wretched brethren in the wilds of Africa. The master knows this, and\r\n  that there is no punishment so effectual to secure labor, or deter\r\n  from misconduct, as the threat of being delivered to the\r\n  soul-driver.[20] Another consequence of this system is the\r\n  prevalence of licentiousness. This is indeed one of the foul\r\n  features of slavery everywhere; but it is especially prevalent and\r\n  indiscriminate where _slave-breeding_ is conducted as a business. It\r\n  grows directly out of the system, and is inseparable from it. * * *\r\n  The pecuniary inducement to general pollution must be very strong,\r\n  since the larger the slave increase the greater the master’s gains,\r\n  and especially since the _mixed blood_ demands a considerably\r\n  _higher price than the pure black_.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the extract contains specifications too dreadful to be\r\nquoted. We can only refer the reader to the volume, p. 13.\r\n\r\nThe poets of America, true to the holy soul of their divine art, have\r\nshed over some of the horrid realities of this trade the pathetic light\r\nof poetry. Longfellow and Whittier have told us, in verses beautiful as\r\nstrung pearls, yet sorrowful as a mother’s tears, some of the incidents\r\nof this unnatural and ghastly traffic. For the sake of a common\r\nhumanity, let us hope that the first extract describes no _common_\r\nevent.\r\n\r\n                           THE QUADROON GIRL.\r\n\r\n              The Slaver in the broad lagoon\r\n                Lay moored with idle sail;\r\n              He waited for the rising moon,\r\n                And for the evening gale.\r\n\r\n              Under the shore his boat was tied\r\n                And all her listless crew\r\n              Watched the gray alligator slide\r\n                Into the still bayou.\r\n\r\n              Odors of orange-flowers and spice\r\n                Reached them, from time to time,\r\n              Like airs that breathe from Paradise\r\n                Upon a world of crime.\r\n\r\n              The Planter, under his roof of thatch,\r\n                Smoked thoughtfully and slow;\r\n              The Slaver’s thumb was on the latch,\r\n                He scorned in haste to go.\r\n\r\n              He said, “My ship at anchor rides\r\n                In yonder broad lagoon;\r\n              I only wait the evening tides,\r\n                And the rising of the moon.”\r\n\r\n              Before them, with her face upraised,\r\n                In timid attitude,\r\n              Like one half curious, half amazed,\r\n                A Quadroon maiden stood.\r\n\r\n              Her eyes were large, and full of light,\r\n                Her arms and neck were bare;\r\n              No garment she wore, save a kirtle bright,\r\n                And her own long raven hair.\r\n\r\n              And on her lips there played a smile\r\n                As holy, meek, and faint,\r\n              As lights in some cathedral aisle\r\n                The features of a saint.\r\n\r\n              “The soil is barren, the farm is old,”\r\n                The thoughtful Planter said;\r\n              Then looked upon the Slaver’s gold,\r\n                And then upon the maid.\r\n\r\n              His heart within him was at strife\r\n                With such accursed gains;\r\n              For he knew whose passions gave her life,\r\n                Whose blood ran in her veins.\r\n\r\n              But the voice of nature was too weak;\r\n                He took the glittering gold!\r\n              Then pale as death grew the maiden’s cheek,\r\n                Her hands as icy cold.\r\n\r\n              The Slaver led her from the door,\r\n                He led her by the hand,\r\n              To be his slave and paramour\r\n                In a strange and distant land!\r\n\r\n

Gone, gone,—sold and gone,\r\n                 To the rice-swamp dank and lone;\r\n               Toiling through the weary day,\r\n               And at night the spoiler’s prey.\r\n               O, that they had earlier died,\r\n               Sleeping calmly, side by side,\r\n               Where the tyrant’s power is o’er,\r\n               And the fetter galls no more!\r\n                 Gone, gone, &c.\r\n\r\n                 Gone, gone,—sold and gone,\r\n                 To the rice-swamp dank and lone.\r\n               By the holy love He beareth,\r\n               By the bruised

mother’s love!\r\n                 Gone, gone, &c.\r\n\r\n                                   JOHN G. WHITTIER.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter of Dr. Bailey, in the _Era_, 1847,\r\npresents a view of this subject more creditable to some Virginia\r\nfamilies. May the number that refuse to part with slaves except by\r\nemancipation increase!\r\n\r\n  The sale of slaves to the south is carried to a great extent. The\r\n  slave-holders do not, so far as I can learn, raise them for that\r\n  special purpose. But, here is a man with a score of slaves, located\r\n  on an exhausted plantation. It must furnish support for all; but,\r\n  while they increase, its capacity of supply decreases. The result\r\n  is, he must emancipate or sell. But he has fallen into debt, and he\r\n  sells to relieve himself from debt, and also from an excess of\r\n  mouths. Or, he requires money to educate his children; or, his\r\n  negroes are sold under execution. From these and other causes, large\r\n  numbers of slaves are continually disappearing from the state, so\r\n  that the next census will undoubtedly show a marked diminution of\r\n  the slave population.\r\n\r\n  The season for this trade is generally from November to April; and\r\n  some estimate that the average number of slaves passing by the\r\n  southern railroad weekly, during that period of six months, is at\r\n  least two hundred. A slave-trader told me that he had known one\r\n  hundred pass in a single night. But this is only one route. Large\r\n  numbers are sent off westwardly, and also by sea, coastwise. The\r\n  Davises, in Petersburg, are the great slave-dealers. They are Jews,\r\n  who came to that place many years ago as poor peddlers; and, I am\r\n  informed, are members of a family which has its representatives in\r\n  Philadelphia, New York, &c.! These men are always in the market,\r\n  giving the highest price for slaves. During the summer and fall they\r\n  buy them up at low prices, trim, shave, wash them, fatten them so\r\n  that they may look sleek, and sell them to great profit. It might\r\n  not be unprofitable to inquire how much Northern capital, and what\r\n  firms in some of the Northern cities, are connected with this\r\n  detestable business.\r\n\r\n  There are many planters here who cannot be persuaded to sell their\r\n  slaves. They have far more than they can find work for, and could at\r\n  any time obtain a high price for them. The temptation is strong, for\r\n  they want more money and fewer dependants. But they resist it, and\r\n  nothing can induce them to part with a single slave, though they\r\n  know that they would be greatly the gainers in a pecuniary sense,\r\n  were they to sell one-half of them. Such men are too good to be\r\n  slave-holders. Would that they might see it their duty to go one\r\n  step further, and become emancipators! The majority of this class of\r\n  planters are religious men, and this is the class to which generally\r\n  are to be referred the various cases of emancipation _by will_, of\r\n  which from time to time we hear accounts.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  This horribly expressive appellation is in common use among the slaves\r\n  of the breeding states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n   SELECT INCIDENTS OF LAWFUL TRADE, OR FACTS STRANGER THAN FICTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe atrocious and sacrilegious system of breeding human beings for sale,\r\nand trading them like cattle in the market, fails to produce the\r\nimpression on the mind that it ought to produce, because it is lost in\r\ngeneralities.\r\n\r\nIt is like the account of a great battle, in which we learn, in round\r\nnumbers, that ten thousand were killed and wounded, and throw the paper\r\nby without a thought.\r\n\r\nSo, when we read of sixty or eighty thousand human beings being raised\r\nyearly and sold in the market, it passes through our mind, but leaves no\r\ndefinite trace.\r\n\r\nSterne says that when he would realize the miseries of captivity, he had\r\nto turn his mind from the idea of hundreds of thousands languishing in\r\ndungeons, and bring before himself the picture of one poor, solitary\r\ncaptive pining in his cell. In like manner, we cannot give any idea of\r\nthe horribly cruel and demoralizing effect of this trade, except by\r\npresenting facts in detail, each fact being a specimen of a class of\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nFor a specimen of the public sentiment and the kind of morals and\r\nmanners which this breeding and trading system produces, both in slaves\r\nand in their owners, the writer gives the following extracts from a\r\nrecent letter of a friend in one of the Southern States.\r\n\r\n  DEAR MRS. S:—The sable goddess who presides over our bed and\r\n  wash-stand is such a queer specimen of her race, that I would give a\r\n  good deal to have you see her. Her whole appearance, as she goes\r\n  giggling and curtseying about, is perfectly comical, and would lead\r\n  a stranger to think her really deficient in intellect. This is,\r\n  however, by no means the case. During our two months’ acquaintance\r\n  with her, we have seen many indications of sterling good sense, that\r\n  would do credit to many a white person with ten times her\r\n  advantages.\r\n\r\n  She is disposed to be very communicative;—seems to feel that she has\r\n  a claim upon our sympathy, in the very fact that we come from the\r\n  North; and we could undoubtedly gain no little knowledge of the\r\n  practical workings of the “peculiar institution,” if we thought\r\n  proper to hold any protracted conversation with her. This, however,\r\n  would insure a visit from the authorities, requesting us to leave\r\n  town in the next train of cars; so we are forced to content\r\n  ourselves with gleaning a few items, now and then, taking care to\r\n  appear quite indifferent to her story, and to cut it short by\r\n  despatching her on some trifling errand;—being equally careful,\r\n  however, to note down her peculiar expressions, as soon as she has\r\n  disappeared. A copy of these I have thought you would like to see,\r\n  especially as illustrating the views of the marriage institution\r\n  which is a necessary result of the great human property relation\r\n  system.\r\n\r\n  A Southern lady, who thinks “negro sentiment” very much exaggerated\r\n  in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” assures us that domestic attachments cannot\r\n  be very strong, where one man will have two or three wives and\r\n  families, on as many different plantations.(!) And the lady of our\r\n  hotel tells us of her cook having received a message from her\r\n  husband, that he has another wife, and she may get another husband,\r\n  with perfect indifference; simply expressing a hope that “she won’t\r\n  find another here during the next month, as she must then be sent to\r\n  her owner, in Georgia, and would be more unwilling to go.” And yet,\r\n  both of these ladies are quite religious, and highly resent any\r\n  insinuation that the moral character of the slaves is not far above\r\n  that of the free negroes at the North.\r\n\r\n  With Violet’s story, I will also enclose that of one of our waiters;\r\n  in which, I think, you will be interested.\r\n\r\n  Violet’s father and mother both died, as she says, “‘fore I had any\r\n  sense,” leaving eleven children—all scattered. “To sabe my life,\r\n  Missis, couldn’t tell dis yer night where one of dem is. Massa lib\r\n  in Charleston. My first husband,—when we was young,—nice man; he had\r\n  seven children; den he sold off to Florida—neber hear from him\r\n  ‘gain. Ole folks die. O, dat’s be my boderation, Missis,—when ole\r\n  people be dead, den we be scattered all ‘bout. Den I sold up\r\n  here—now hab ‘noder husband—hab four children up here. I lib bery\r\n  easy when my young husband ‘libe—and we had children bery fast. But\r\n  now dese yer ones tight fellers. Massa don’t ‘low us to raise\r\n  noting; no pig—no goat—no dog—no noting; won’t allow us raise a bit\r\n  of corn. _We has to do jist de best we can._ Dey don’t gib us a\r\n  single grain but jist two homespun frocks—no coat ‘t all.\r\n\r\n  “Can’t go to meetin, ‘cause, Missis, get dis work done—den get\r\n  dinner. In summer, I goes ebery Sunday ebening; but dese yer short\r\n  days, time done get dinner dishes washed, den time get supper.\r\n  Gen’lly goes Baptist church.”\r\n\r\n  “Do your people usually go there?”\r\n\r\n  “Dere bees tree shares ob dem—Methodist gang, Baptist gang,\r\n  ‘Piscopal gang. Last summer, use to hab right smart[21] meetins in\r\n  our yard, Sunday night. Massa Johnson preach to us. Den he said\r\n  couldn’t hab two meetins—we might go to church.”\r\n\r\n  “Why?”\r\n\r\n  “Gracious knows. I lubs to go to meetin allers—‘specially when dere\r\n  ‘s good preaching—lubs to hab people talk good to me—likes to hab\r\n  people read to me, too. ‘Cause don’t b’long to church, no reason why\r\n  I shan’t.”\r\n\r\n  “Does your master like to have others read to you?”\r\n\r\n  “He won’t hinder—I an’t bound tell him when folks reads to me. I hab\r\n  _my_ soul to sabe—he hab _his_ soul to sabe. Our owners won’t stand\r\n  few minutes and read to us—dey tink it too great honor—dey’s bery\r\n  hard on us. Brack preachers sometimes talk good to us, and pray wid\r\n  us,—and _pray a heap for_ DEM _too_.\r\n\r\n  “I jest done hab great quarrel wid Dinah, down in de kitchen. I\r\n  tells Dinah, ‘De way you goes on spile all do women’s\r\n  character.’—She say she didn’t care, she do what she please wid\r\n  herself. Dinah, she slip away somehow from her first husband, and\r\n  hab ‘noder child by Sambo (he b’long to Massa D.); so she and her\r\n  first husband dey fall out somehow. Dese yer men, yer know, is so\r\n  queer, Missis, dey don’t neber like sich tings.\r\n\r\n  “Ye know, Missis, tings we lub, we don’t like hab anybody else hab\r\n  ‘em. Such a ting as dat, Missis, tetch your heart so, ef you don’t\r\n  mind, ‘t will fret you almost to death. Ef my husband was to slip\r\n  away from me, Missis, dat ar way, it ud wake me right up. I’m brack,\r\n  but I wouldn’t do so to my husband, neider. What I hide behind de\r\n  curtain now, I can’t hide it behind de curtain when I stand before\r\n  God—de whole world know it den.\r\n\r\n  “Dinah’s (second) husband say what she do for her first husband\r\n  noting to him;—now, my husband don’t feel so. He say he wouldn’t do\r\n  as Daniel do—he wouldn’t buy tings for de oder children—dem as has\r\n  de children might buy de tings for dem. Well, so dere dey\r\n  is.—Dinah’s first husband come up wheneber he can, to see his\r\n  children,—and Sambo, he come up to see _his_ child, and gib Dinah\r\n  tings for it.\r\n\r\n  “You know, Missis, Massa hab no nigger but me and one yellow girl,\r\n  when he bought me and my four children. Well, den Massa, he want me\r\n  to breed; so he say, ‘Violet, you must take some nigger here in C.’\r\n\r\n  “Den I say, ‘No, Massa, I can’t take any here.’ Den he say, ‘You\r\n  _must_, Violet;’ ‘cause you see he want me breed for him; so he say\r\n  plenty young fellers here, but I say I can’t hab any ob dem. Well,\r\n  den, Missis, he go down Virginia, and he bring up two niggers,—and\r\n  dey was pretty ole men,—and Missis say, ‘One of dem’s for you,\r\n  Violet;’ but I say, ‘No, Missis, I can’t take one of dem, ‘cause I\r\n  don’t lub ‘em, and I can’t hab one I don’t lub.’ Den Massa, he say,\r\n  ‘You _must take one of dese_—and _den, ef you can’t lub him, you\r\n  must find somebody else you can lub_.’ Den I say, ‘O, no, Massa! I\r\n  can’t do dat—_I can’t hab one ebery day_.’ Well, den, by-and-by,\r\n  Massa he buy tree more, and den Missis say, ‘Now, Violet, ones dem\r\n  is for you.’ I say, ‘I do’no—maybe I can’t lub one dem neider;’ but\r\n  she say, ‘You _must_ hab one ob dese.’ Well, so Sam and I we lib\r\n  along two year—he watchin my ways, and I watchin his ways.\r\n\r\n  “At last, one night, we was standin’ by de wood-pile togeder, and de\r\n  moon bery shine, and I do’no how ‘t was, Missis, he answer me, he\r\n  wan’t a wife, but he didn’t know where he get one. I say, plenty\r\n  girls in G. He say, ‘Yes—but maybe I shan’t find any I like so well\r\n  as you.’ Den I say maybe he wouldn’t like my ways, ‘cause I’se an\r\n  ole woman, and I hab four children by my first husband; and anybody\r\n  marry me, must be jest kind to dem children as dey was to me, else I\r\n  couldn’t lub him. Den he say, ‘Ef he had a woman ‘t had\r\n  children,’—mind you, he didn’t say me,—‘he would be jest as kind to\r\n  de children as he was to de moder, and dat’s ‘cordin to how she do\r\n  by him.’ Well, so we went on from one ting to anoder, till at last\r\n  we say we’d take one anoder, and so we’ve libed togeder eber\r\n  since—and I’s had four children by him—and he neber slip away from\r\n  me, nor I from him.”\r\n\r\n  “How are you married in your yard?”\r\n\r\n  “We jest _takes_ one anoder—we asks de white folks’ leave—and den\r\n  takes one anoder. Some folks, dey’s married by de book; but den,\r\n  what’s de use? Dere’s my fus husband, we’se married by de book, and\r\n  he sold way off to Florida, and I’s here. Dey wants to do what dey\r\n  please wid us, so dey don’t want us to be married. Dey don’t care\r\n  what we does, so we jest makes money for dem.\r\n\r\n  “My fus husband,—he young, and he _bery_ kind to me,—O, Missis, he\r\n  _bery kind indeed_. He set up all night and work, so as to make me\r\n  comfortable. O, we got ‘long bery well when I had him; but he sold\r\n  way off Florida, and, sence then, Missis, _I jest gone_ to noting.\r\n  Dese yer white people dey hab here, dey won’t ‘low us noting—noting\r\n  at all—jest gibs us food, and two suits a year—a broad stripe and a\r\n  narrow stripe; you’ll see ‘em, Missis.”—\r\n\r\n  And we did “see ‘em;” for Violet brought us the “narrow stripe,”\r\n  with a request that we would fit it for her. There was just enough\r\n  to cover her, but no hooks and eyes, cotton, or even lining; these\r\n  extras she must get as she can; and yet her master receives from our\r\n  host eight dollars per month for her services. We asked how she got\r\n  the “broad stripe” made up.\r\n\r\n  “O, Missis, my husband,—he working now out on de farm,—so he hab\r\n  ‘lowance four pounds bacon and one peck of meal ebery week; so he\r\n  stinge heself, so as to gib me four pounds bacon to pay for making\r\n  my frock.” [Query.—Are there any husbands in refined circles who\r\n  would do more than this?]\r\n\r\n  Once, finding us all three busily writing, Violet stood for some\r\n  moments silently watching the mysterious motion of our pens, and\r\n  then, in a tone of deepest sadness, said,\r\n\r\n  “O! dat be great comfort, Missis. _You_ can write to _your_ friends\r\n  all ‘bout ebery ting, and so hab dem write to you. Our people can’t\r\n  do so. Wheder dey be ‘live or dead, we can’t neber know—_only\r\n  sometimes we hears dey be dead_.”\r\n\r\nWhat more expressive comment on the cruel laws that forbid the slave to\r\nbe taught to write!\r\n\r\nThe history of the serving-man is thus given:\r\n\r\n  George’s father and mother belonged to somebody in Florida. During\r\n  the war, two older sisters got on board an English vessel, and went\r\n  to Halifax. His mother was very anxious to go with them, and take\r\n  the whole family; but her husband persuaded her to wait until the\r\n  next ship sailed, when he thought he should be able to go too. By\r\n  this delay opportunity of escape was lost, and the whole family were\r\n  soon after sold for debt. George, one sister, and their mother, were\r\n  bought by the same man. He says, “My old boss cry powerful when she\r\n  (the mother) die; say he’d rather lost two thousand dollars. She was\r\n  part Indian—hair straight as yourn—and she was white as dat ar\r\n  pillow.” George married a woman in _another_ yard. He gave this\r\n  reason for it: “‘Cause, when a man sees his wife ‘bused, he can’t\r\n  help feelin’ it. When he _hears_ his wife’s ‘bused, ‘t an’t like as\r\n  how it is when he _sees_ it. Then I can fadge for her better than\r\n  when she’s in my own yard.” This wife was sold up country, but after\r\n  some years became “lame and sick—couldn’t do much—so her massa gabe\r\n  her her time, and paid her fare to G.”—[The sick and infirm are\r\n  always provided for, you know.]—“Hadn’t seen her for tree years,”\r\n  said George; “but soon as I heard of it, went right down,—hired a\r\n  house, and got some one to take care ob her,—and used to go to see\r\n  her ebery tree months.” He is a mechanic, and worked sometimes all\r\n  night to earn money to do this. His master asks twenty dollars per\r\n  month for his services, and allows him fifty cents per week for\r\n  clothes, etc. J. says, if he could only save, by working nights,\r\n  money enough to buy himself, he would get some one he could trust to\r\n  buy him; “den work hard as eber, till I could buy my children, den\r\n  I’d get away from dis yer.”—\r\n\r\n  “Where?”\r\n\r\n  “O! Philadelphia—New York—somewhere North.”\r\n\r\n  “Why, you’d freeze to death.”\r\n\r\n  “O, no, Missis! I can bear cold. I want to go _where I can belong to\r\n  myself_, and do as I want to.”\r\n\r\nThe following communication has been given to the writer by Captain\r\nAustin Bearse, ship-master in Boston. Mr. Bearse is a native of\r\nBarnstable, Cape Cod. He is well known to our Boston citizens and\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\n  I am a native of the State of Massachusetts. Between the years 1818\r\n  and 1830 I was, from time to time, mate on board of different\r\n  vessels engaged in the coasting trade on the coast of South\r\n  Carolina.\r\n\r\n  It is well known that many New England vessels are in the habit of\r\n  spending their winters on the southern coast in pursuit of this\r\n  business. Our vessels used to run up the rivers for the rough rice\r\n  and cotton of the plantations, which we took to Charleston.\r\n\r\n  We often carried gangs of slaves to the plantations, as they had\r\n  been ordered. These slaves were generally collected by slave-traders\r\n  in the slave-pens in Charleston,—brought there by various causes,\r\n  such as the death of owners and the division of estates, which threw\r\n  them into the market. Some were sent as punishment for\r\n  insubordination, or because the domestic establishment was too\r\n  large, or because persons moving to the North or West preferred\r\n  selling their slaves to the trouble of carrying them. We had on\r\n  board our vessels, from time to time, numbers of these\r\n  slaves,—sometimes two or three, and sometimes as high as seventy or\r\n  eighty. They were separated from their families and connections with\r\n  as little concern as calves and pigs are selected out of a lot of\r\n  domestic animals.\r\n\r\n  Our vessels used to lie in a place called Poor Man’s Hole, not far\r\n  from the city. We used to allow the relations and friends of the\r\n  slaves to come on board and stay all night with their friends,\r\n  before the vessel sailed.\r\n\r\n  In the morning it used to be my business to pull off the hatches and\r\n  warn them that it was time to separate; and the shrieks and\r\n  heart-rending cries at these times were enough to make anybody’s\r\n  heart ache.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1828, while mate of the brig Milton, from Boston, bound\r\n  to New Orleans, the following incident occurred, which I shall never\r\n  forget:\r\n\r\n  The traders brought on board four quadroon men in handcuffs, to be\r\n  stowed away for the New Orleans market. An old negro woman, more\r\n  than eighty years of age, came screaming after them, “My son, O, my\r\n  son, my son!” She seemed almost frantic, and when we had got more\r\n  than a mile out in the harbor we heard her screaming yet.\r\n\r\n  When we got into the Gulf Stream, I came to the men, and took off\r\n  their handcuffs. They were resolute fellows, and they told me that I\r\n  would see that they would never live to be slaves in New Orleans.\r\n  One of the men was a carpenter, and one a blacksmith. We brought\r\n  them into New Orleans, and consigned them over to the agent. The\r\n  agent told the captain afterwards that in forty-eight hours after\r\n  they came to New Orleans they were all dead men, having every one\r\n  killed themselves, as they said they should. One of them, I know,\r\n  was bought for a fireman on the steamer Post Boy, that went down to\r\n  the Balize. He jumped over, and was drowned.\r\n\r\n  The others,—one was sold to a blacksmith, and one to a carpenter.\r\n  The particulars of their death I didn’t know, only that the agent\r\n  told the captain that they were all dead.\r\n\r\n  There was a plantation at Coosahatchie, back of Charleston, S. C.,\r\n  kept by a widow lady, who owned eighty negroes. She sent to\r\n  Charleston, and bought a quadroon girl, very nearly white, for her\r\n  son. We carried her up. She was more delicate than our other slaves,\r\n  so that she was not put with them, but was carried up in the cabin.\r\n\r\n  I have been on the rice-plantations on the river, and seen the\r\n  cultivation of the rice. In the fall of the year, the plantation\r\n  hands, both men and women, work all the time above their knees in\r\n  water in the rice-ditches, pulling out the grass, to fit the ground\r\n  for sowing the rice. Hands sold here from the city, having been bred\r\n  mostly to house-labor, find this very severe. The plantations are so\r\n  deadly that white people cannot remain on them during the\r\n  summer-time, except at a risk of life. The proprietors and their\r\n  families are there only through the winter, and the slaves are left\r\n  in the summer entirely under the care of the overseers. Such\r\n  overseers as I saw were generally a brutal, gambling, drinking set.\r\n\r\n  I have seen slavery, in the course of my wanderings, in almost all\r\n  the countries in the world. I have been to Algiers, and seen slavery\r\n  there. I have seen slavery in Smyrna, among the Turks. I was in\r\n  Smyrna when our American consul ransomed a beautiful Greek girl in\r\n  the slave-market. I saw her come aboard the brig Suffolk, when she\r\n  came on board to be sent to America for her education. I have seen\r\n  slavery in the Spanish and French ports, though I have not been on\r\n  their plantations.\r\n\r\n  My opinion is that American slavery, as I have seen it in the\r\n  internal slave-trade, as I have seen it on the rice and sugar\r\n  plantations, and in the city of New Orleans, is _full as bad_ as\r\n  slavery in any country of the world, heathen or Christian. People\r\n  who go for visits or pleasure through the Southern States cannot\r\n  possibly know those things which can be seen of slavery by\r\n  ship-masters who run up into the back plantations of countries, and\r\n  who transport the slaves and produce of plantations.\r\n\r\n  In my past days the system of slavery was not much discussed. I saw\r\n  these things as others did, without interference. Because I no\r\n  longer think it right to see these things in silence, I trade no\r\n  more south of Mason & Dixon’s line.\r\n\r\n                                                        AUSTIN BEARSE.\r\n\r\nThe following account was given to the writer by Lewis Hayden. Hayden\r\nwas a fugitive slave, who escaped from Kentucky by the assistance of a\r\nyoung lady named Delia Webster, and a man named Calvin Fairbanks. Both\r\nwere imprisoned. Lewis Hayden has earned his own character as a free\r\ncitizen of Boston, where he can find an abundance of vouchers for his\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n  I belonged to the Rev. Adam Runkin, a Presbyterian minister in\r\n  Lexington, Kentucky.\r\n\r\n  My mother was of mixed blood,—white and Indian. She married my\r\n  father when he was working in a bagging factory near by. After a\r\n  while my father’s owner moved off and took my father with him, which\r\n  broke up the marriage. She was a very handsome woman. My master kept\r\n  a large dairy, and she was the milk-woman. Lexington was a small\r\n  town in those days, and the dairy was in the town. Back of the\r\n  college was the Masonic lodge. A man who belonged to the lodge saw\r\n  my mother when she was about her work. He made proposals of a base\r\n  nature to her. When she would have nothing to say to him, he told\r\n  her that she need not be so independent, for if money could buy her\r\n  he would have her. My mother told old mistress, and begged that\r\n  master might not sell her. But he did sell her. My mother had a high\r\n  spirit, being part Indian. She would not consent to live with this\r\n  man, as he wished; and he sent her to prison, and had her flogged,\r\n  and punished her in various ways, so that at last she began to have\r\n  crazy turns. When I read in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” about Cassy, it put\r\n  me in mind of my mother, and I wanted to tell Mrs. S—— about her.\r\n  She tried to kill herself several times, once with a knife and once\r\n  by hanging. She had long, straight black hair, but after this it all\r\n  turned white, like an old person’s. When she had her raving turns\r\n  she always talked about her children. The jailer told the owner that\r\n  if he would let her go to her children, perhaps she would get quiet.\r\n  They let her out one time, and she came to the place where we were.\r\n  I might have been seven or eight years old,—don’t know my age\r\n  exactly. I was not at home when she came. I came in and found her in\r\n  one of the cabins near the kitchen. She sprung and caught my arms,\r\n  and seemed going to break them, and then said, “I’ll fix _you_ so\r\n  they’ll never get you!” I screamed, for I thought she was going to\r\n  kill me; they came in and took me away. They tied her, and carried\r\n  her off. Sometimes, when she was in her right mind, she used to tell\r\n  me what things they had done to her. At last her owner sold her, for\r\n  a small sum, to a man named Lackey. While with him she had another\r\n  husband and several children. After a while this husband either died\r\n  or was sold, I do not remember which. The man then sold her to\r\n  another person, named Bryant. My own father’s owner now came and\r\n  lived in the neighborhood of this man, and brought my mother with\r\n  him. He had had another wife and family of children where he had\r\n  been living. He and my mother came together again, and finished\r\n  their days together. My mother almost recovered her mind in her last\r\n  days.\r\n\r\n  I never saw anything in Kentucky which made me suppose that\r\n  ministers or professors of religion considered it any more wrong to\r\n  separate the families of slaves by sale than to separate any\r\n  domestic animals.\r\n\r\n  There may be ministers and professors of religion who think it is\r\n  wrong, but I never met with them. My master was a minister, and yet\r\n  he sold my mother, as I have related.\r\n\r\n  When he was going to leave Kentucky for Pennsylvania, he sold all my\r\n  brothers and sisters at auction. I stood by and saw them sold. When\r\n  I was just going up on to the block, he swapped me off for a pair of\r\n  carriage-horses. I looked at those horses with strange feelings. I\r\n  had indulged hopes that master would take me into Pennsylvania with\r\n  him, and I should get free. How I looked at those horses, and walked\r\n  round them, and thought for _them_ I was sold!\r\n\r\n  It was commonly reported that my master had said in the pulpit that\r\n  there was no more harm in separating a family of slaves than a\r\n  litter of pigs. I did not hear him say it, and so cannot say whether\r\n  this is true or not.\r\n\r\n  It may seem strange, but it is a fact,—I had more sympathy and kind\r\n  advice, in my efforts to get my freedom, from gamblers and such sort\r\n  of men, than Christians. Some of the gamblers were very kind to me:\r\n\r\n  I never knew a slave-trader that did not seem to think, in his\r\n  heart, that the trade was a bad one. I knew a great many of them,\r\n  such as Neal, McAnn, Cobb, Stone, Pulliam and Davis, &c. They were\r\n  like Haley,—they meant to repent when they got through.\r\n\r\n  Intelligent colored people in my circle of acquaintance, as a\r\n  general thing, _felt no security whatever for their family ties_.\r\n  Some, it is true, who belonged to rich families, felt some security,\r\n  but those of us who looked deeper, and knew how many were not rich\r\n  that seemed so, and saw how fast money slipped away, were always\r\n  miserable. The trader was all around, the slave-pens at hand, and we\r\n  did not know what time any of us might be in it. Then there were the\r\n  rice-swamps, and the sugar and cotton plantations; we had had them\r\n  held before us as terrors, by our masters and mistresses, all our\r\n  lives. We knew about them all; and when a friend was carried off,\r\n  why, it was the same as death, for we could not write or hear, and\r\n  never expected to see them again.\r\n\r\n  I have one child who is buried in Kentucky, and that grave is\r\n  pleasant to think of. I’ve got another that is sold nobody knows\r\n  where, and that I never can bear to think of.\r\n\r\n                                                         LEWIS HAYDEN.\r\n\r\nThe next history is a long one, and part of it transpired in a most\r\npublic manner, in the face of our whole community.\r\n\r\nThe history includes in it the whole account of that memorable capture\r\nof the Pearl, which produced such a sensation in Washington in the year\r\n1848. The author, however, will preface it with a short history of a\r\nslave woman who had six children embarked in that ill-fated enterprise.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  _Right smart of_—that is, a great many of—an idiom of Anglo-Ethiopia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilly Edmondson is an aged woman, now upwards of seventy. She has\r\nreceived the slave’s inheritance of entire ignorance. She cannot read a\r\nletter of a book, nor write her own name; but the writer must say that\r\nshe was never so impressed with any presentation of the Christian\r\nreligion as that which was made to her in the language and appearance of\r\nthis woman during the few interviews that she had with her. The\r\ncircumstances of the interviews will be detailed at length in the course\r\nof the story.\r\n\r\nMilly is above the middle height, of a large, full figure. She dresses\r\nwith the greatest attention to neatness. A plain Methodist cap shades\r\nher face, and the plain white Methodist handkerchief is folded across\r\nthe bosom. A well-preserved stuff gown, and clean white apron, with a\r\nwhite pocket-handkerchief pinned to her side, completes the inventory of\r\nthe costume in which the writer usually saw her. She is a mulatto, and\r\nmust once have been a very handsome one. Her eyes and smile are still\r\nuncommonly beautiful, but there are deep-wrought lines of patient sorrow\r\nand weary endurance on her face, which tell that this lovely and\r\nnoble-hearted woman has been all her life a slave.\r\n\r\nMilly Edmondson was kept by her owners and allowed to live with her\r\nhusband, with the express understanding and agreement that her service\r\nand value was to consist in breeding up her own children to be sold in\r\nthe slave-market. Her legal owner was a maiden lady of feeble capacity,\r\nwho was set aside by the decision of court as incompetent to manage her\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThe estate—that is to say, Milly Edmondson and her children—was placed\r\nin the care of a guardian. It appears that Milly’s poor, infirm mistress\r\nwas fond of her, and that Milly exercised over her much of that\r\nascendency which a strong mind holds over a weak one. Milly’s husband,\r\nPaul Edmondson was a free man. A little of her history, as she related\r\nit to the writer, will now be given in her own words:\r\n\r\n“Her mistress,” she said, “was always kind to her ‘poor thing!’ but then\r\nshe hadn’t _sperit_ ever to speak for herself, and her friends wouldn’t\r\nlet her have her own way. It always laid on my mind,” she said, “that I\r\nwas a slave. When I wan’t more than fourteen years old, Missis was doing\r\nsome work one day that she thought she couldn’t trust me with, and she\r\nsays to me, ‘Milly, now you see it’s I that am the slave, and not you.’\r\nI says to her, ‘Ah, Missis, I am a poor slave, for all that.’ I’s sorry\r\nafterwards I said it, for I thought it seemed to hurt her feelings.\r\n\r\n“Well, after a while, when I got engaged to Paul, I loved Paul very\r\nmuch; but I thought it wan’t right to bring children into the world to\r\nbe slaves, and I told our folks that I was never going to marry, though\r\nI did love Paul. But that wan’t to be allowed,” she said, with a\r\nmysterious air.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” said I.\r\n\r\n“Well, they told me I must marry, or I should be turned out of the\r\nchurch—so it was,” she added, with a significant nod.—“Well, Paul and\r\nme, we was married, and we was happy enough, if it hadn’t been for that;\r\nbut when our first child was born I says to him, ‘There ‘t is, now,\r\nPaul, our troubles is begun; this child isn’t ours.’ And every child I\r\nhad, it grew worse and worse. ‘O, Paul,’ says I, ‘what a thing it is to\r\nhave children that isn’t ours!’ Paul he says to me, ‘Milly, my dear, if\r\nthey be God’s children, it an’t so much matter whether they be ours or\r\nno; they may be heirs of the kingdom, Milly, for all that.’ Well, when\r\nPaul’s mistress died, she set him free, and he got him a little place\r\nout about fourteen miles from Washington; and they let me live out there\r\nwith him, and take home my tasks; for they had that confidence in me\r\nthat they always know’d that what I said I’d do was as good done as if\r\nthey’d seen it done. I had mostly sewing; sometimes a shirt to make in a\r\nday,—it was coarse like, you know,—or a pair of sheets, or some such;\r\nbut, whatever ‘t was, I always got it done. Then I had all my house-work\r\nand babies to take care of; and many’s the time, after ten o’clock, I’ve\r\ntook my children’s clothes and washed ‘em all out and ironed ‘em late in\r\nthe night, ‘cause I couldn’t never bear to see my children dirty,—always\r\nwanted to see ‘em sweet and clean, and I brought ‘em up and taught ‘em\r\nthe very best ways I was able. But nobody knows what I suffered; I never\r\nsee a white man come on to the place that I didn’t think, ‘There, now,\r\nhe’s coming to look at my children;’ and when I saw any white man going\r\nby, I’ve called in my children and hid ‘em, for fear he’d see ‘em and\r\nwant to buy ‘em. O, ma’am, mine’s been a long sorrow, a long sorrow!\r\nI’ve borne this heavy cross a great many years.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said I, “the Lord has been with you.”\r\n\r\nShe answered, with very strong emphasis, “Ma’am, if the Lord hadn’t held\r\nme up, I shouldn’t have been alive this day. O, sometimes my heart’s\r\nbeen so heavy, it seemed as if I _must_ die; and then I’ve been to the\r\nthrone of grace, and when I’d poured out all my sorrows there, I came\r\naway _light_, and felt that I could live a little longer.”\r\n\r\nThis language is exactly her own. She had often a forcible and\r\npeculiarly beautiful manner of expressing herself, which impressed what\r\nshe said strongly.\r\n\r\nPaul and Milly Edmondson were both devout communicants in the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church at Washington, and the testimony to their blamelessness\r\nof life and the consistence of their piety is unanimous from all who\r\nknow them. In their simple cottage, made respectable by neatness and\r\norder, and hallowed by morning and evening prayer, they trained up their\r\nchildren, to the best of their poor ability, in the nurture and\r\nadmonition of the Lord, to be sold in the slave-market. They thought\r\nthemselves only too happy, as one after another arrived at the age when\r\nthey were to be sold, that they were hired to families in their\r\nvicinity, and not thrown into the trader’s pen to be drafted for the\r\ndreaded southern market!\r\n\r\nThe mother, feeling, with a constant but repressed anguish, the weary\r\nburden of slavery which lay upon her, was accustomed, as she told the\r\nwriter, thus to warn her daughters:\r\n\r\n“Now, girls, don’t you never come to the sorrows that I have. Don’t you\r\nnever marry till you get your liberty. Don’t you marry, to be mothers to\r\n_children that an’t your own_.”\r\n\r\nAs a result of this education, some of her older daughters, in\r\nconnection with the young men to whom they were engaged, raised the sum\r\nnecessary to pay for their freedom before they were married. One of\r\nthese young women, at the time that she paid for her freedom, was in\r\nsuch feeble health that the physician told her that she could not live\r\nmany months, and advised her to keep the money, and apply it to making\r\nherself as comfortable as she could.\r\n\r\nShe answered, “If I had only two hours to live, I would pay down that\r\nmoney to die free.”\r\n\r\nIf this was setting an extravagant value on liberty, it is not for an\r\nAmerican to say so.\r\n\r\nAll the sons and daughters of this family were distinguished both for\r\ntheir physical and mental developments, and therefore were priced\r\nexceedingly high in the market. The whole family, rated by the market\r\nprices which have been paid for certain members of it, might be\r\nestimated as an estate of fifteen thousand dollars. They were\r\ndistinguished for intelligence, honesty and faithfulness, but above all\r\nfor the most devoted attachment to each other. These children, thus\r\nintelligent, were all held as slaves in the city of Washington, the very\r\ncapital where our national government is conducted. Of course, the high\r\nestimate which their own mother taught them to place upon liberty was in\r\nthe way of being constantly strengthened and reinforced by such\r\naddresses, celebrations and speeches, on the subject of liberty, as\r\nevery one knows are constantly being made, on one occasion or another,\r\nin our national capital.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th day of April, the little schooner PEARL, commanded by Daniel\r\nDrayton, came to anchor in the Potomac river, at Washington.\r\n\r\nThe news had just arrived of a revolution in France, and the\r\nestablishment of a democratic government, and all Washington was turning\r\nout to celebrate the triumph of Liberty.\r\n\r\nThe trees in the avenue were fancifully hung with many-colored\r\nlanterns,—drums beat, bands of music played, the houses of the President\r\nand other high officials were illuminated, and men, women and children,\r\nwere all turned out to see the procession, and to join in the shouts of\r\nliberty that rent the air. Of course, all the slaves of the city,\r\nlively, fanciful and sympathetic, most excitable as they are by music\r\nand by dazzling spectacles, were everywhere listening, seeing, and\r\nrejoicing, in ignorant joy. All the heads of department, senators,\r\nrepresentatives, and dignitaries of all kinds, marched in procession to\r\nan open space on Pennsylvania Avenue, and there delivered congratulatory\r\naddresses on the progress of universal freedom. With unheard-of\r\nimprudence, the most earnest defenders of slave-holding institutions\r\npoured down on the listening crowd, both of black and white, bond and\r\nfree, the most inflammatory and incendiary sentiments. Such, for\r\nexample, as the following language of Hon. Frederick P. Stanton, of\r\nTennessee:\r\n\r\n  We do not, indeed, propagate our principles with the sword of power;\r\n  but there is one sense in which we are propagandists. We cannot help\r\n  being so. Our example is contagious. In the section of this great\r\n  country where I live, on the banks of the mighty Mississippi river,\r\n  we have the true emblem of the tree of liberty. There you may see\r\n  the giant cotton-wood spreading his branches widely to the winds of\r\n  heaven. Sometimes the current lays bare his roots, and you behold\r\n  them extending far around, and penetrating to an immense depth in\r\n  the soil. When the season of maturity comes, the air is filled with\r\n  a cotton-like substance, which floats in every direction, bearing on\r\n  its light wings the living seeds of the mighty tree. Thus the seeds\r\n  of freedom have emanated from the tree of our liberties. They fill\r\n  the air. They are wafted to every part of the habitable globe. And\r\n  even in the barren sands of tyranny they are destined to take root.\r\n  The tree of liberty will spring up everywhere, and nations shall\r\n  recline in its shade.\r\n\r\nSenator Foote, of Mississippi, also, used this language:\r\n\r\n  Such has been the extraordinary course of events in France, and in\r\n  Europe, within the last two months, that the more deliberately we\r\n  survey the scene which has been spread out before us, and the more\r\n  rigidly we scrutinize the conduct of its actors, the more confident\r\n  does our conviction become that the _glorious work_ which has been\r\n  so well begun cannot possibly fail of complete accomplishment; that\r\n  the age of TYRANTS AND SLAVERY is rapidly drawing to a close; and\r\n  that the happy period to be signalized by the _universal\r\n  emancipation of man_ from the _fetters of civil oppression_, and the\r\n  recognition _in all countries_ of the great principles of _popular\r\n  sovereignty, equality, and_ BROTHERHOOD, is, at this moment, visibly\r\n  commencing.\r\n\r\nWill any one be surprised, after this, that seventy-seven of the most\r\nintelligent young slaves, male and female, in Washington city, honestly\r\ntaking Mr. Foote and his brother senators at their word, and believing\r\nthat the age of tyrants and slavery was drawing to a close, banded\r\ntogether, and made an effort to obtain their part in this reign of\r\nuniversal brotherhood?\r\n\r\nThe schooner Pearl was lying in the harbor, and Captain Drayton was\r\nfound to have the heart of a man. Perhaps he, too, had listened to the\r\naddresses on Pennsylvania Avenue, and thought, in the innocence of his\r\nheart, that a man who really _did_ something to promote universal\r\nemancipation was no worse than the men who only made speeches about it.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, Drayton was persuaded to allow these seventy-seven slaves\r\nto secrete themselves in the hold of his vessel, and among them were six\r\nchildren of Paul and Milly Edmondson. The incidents of the rest of the\r\nnarrative will now be given as obtained from Mary and Emily Edmondson,\r\nby the lady in whose family they have been placed by the writer for an\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nSome few preliminaries maybe necessary, in order to understand the\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nA respectable colored man, by the name of Daniel Bell, who had purchased\r\nhis own freedom, resided in the city of Washington. His wife, with her\r\neight children, were set free by her master, when on his death-bed. The\r\nheirs endeavored to break the will, on the ground that he was not of\r\nsound mind at the time of its preparation. The magistrate, however,\r\nbefore whom it was executed, by his own personal knowledge of the\r\ncompetence of the man at the time, was enabled to defeat their\r\npurpose;—the family, therefore, lived as free for some years. On the\r\ndeath of this magistrate, the heirs again brought the case into court,\r\nand, as it seemed likely to be decided against the family, they resolved\r\nto secure their legal rights by flight, and engaged passage on board the\r\nvessel of Captain Drayton. Many of their associates and friends, stirred\r\nup, perhaps, by the recent demonstrations in favor of liberty, begged\r\nleave to accompany them, in their flight. The seeds of the cotton-wood\r\nwere flying everywhere, and springing up in all hearts; so that, on the\r\neventful evening of the 15th of April, 1848, not less than seventy-seven\r\nmen, women and children, with beating hearts, and anxious secrecy,\r\nstowed themselves away in the hold of the little schooner, and Captain\r\nDrayton was so wicked that he could not, for the life of him, say “Nay”\r\nto one of them.\r\n\r\nRichard Edmondson had long sought to buy his liberty; had toiled for it\r\nearly and late; but the price set upon him was so high that he despaired\r\nof ever earning it. On this evening, he and his three brothers thought,\r\nas the reign of universal brotherhood had begun, and the reign of\r\ntyrants and slavery come to an end, that they would take to themselves\r\nand their sisters that sacred gift of liberty, which all Washington had\r\nbeen informed, two evenings before, it was the peculiar province of\r\nAmerica to give to all nations. Their two sisters, aged sixteen and\r\nfourteen, were hired out in families in the city. On this evening Samuel\r\nEdmondson called at the house where Emily lived, and told her of the\r\nprojected plan.\r\n\r\n“But what will mother think?” said Emily.\r\n\r\n“Don’t stop to think of her; she would rather we’d be free than to spend\r\ntime to talk about her.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, if Mary will go, I will.”\r\n\r\nThe girls give as a reason for wishing to escape, that though they had\r\nnever suffered hardships or been treated unkindly, yet they knew they\r\nwere liable at any time to be sold into rigorous bondage, and separated\r\nfar from all they loved.\r\n\r\nThey then all went on board the Pearl, which was lying a little way off\r\nfrom the place where vessels usually anchor. There they found a company\r\nof slaves, seventy-seven in number.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o’clock at night the silent wings of the little schooner were\r\nspread, and with her weight of fear and mystery she glided out into the\r\nstream. A fresh breeze sprang up, and by eleven o’clock next night they\r\nhad sailed two hundred miles from Washington, and began to think that\r\nliberty was gained. They anchored in a place called Cornfield Harbor,\r\nintending to wait for daylight. All laid down to sleep in peaceful\r\nsecurity, lulled by the gentle rock of the vessel and the rippling of\r\nthe waters.\r\n\r\nBut at two o’clock at night they were roused by terrible noises on deck,\r\nscuffling, screaming, swearing and groaning. A steamer had pursued and\r\novertaken them, and the little schooner was boarded by an infuriated set\r\nof armed men. In a moment, the captain, mate and all the crew, were\r\nseized and bound, amid oaths and dreadful threats. As they, swearing and\r\nyelling, tore open the hatches on the defenceless prisoners below,\r\nRichard Edmondson stepped forward, and in a calm voice said to them,\r\n“Gentlemen, do yourselves no harm, for we are all here.” With this\r\nexception, all was still among the slaves as despair could make it; not\r\na word was spoken in the whole company. The men were all bound and\r\nplaced on board the steamer; the women were left on board the schooner,\r\nto be towed after.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of their capture was this: In the morning after they had\r\nsailed, many families in Washington found their slaves missing, and the\r\nevent created as great an excitement as the emancipation of France had,\r\ntwo days before. At that time they had listened in the most complacent\r\nmanner to the announcement that the reign of slavery was near its close,\r\nbecause they had not the slightest idea that the language meant\r\nanything; and they were utterly confounded by this practical application\r\nof it. More than a hundred men, mounted upon horses, determined to push\r\nout into the country, in pursuit of these new disciples of the doctrine\r\nof universal emancipation. Here a colored man, by the name of Judson\r\nDiggs, betrayed the whole plot. He had been provoked, because, after\r\nhaving taken a poor woman, with her luggage, down to the boat, she was\r\nunable to pay the twenty-five cents that he demanded. So he told these\r\nadmirers of universal brotherhood that they need not ride into the\r\ncountry, as their slaves had sailed down the river, and were far enough\r\noff by this time. A steamer was immediately manned by two hundred armed\r\nmen, and away they went in pursuit.\r\n\r\nWhen the cortege arrived with the captured slaves, there was a most\r\nfurious excitement in the city. The men were driven through the streets\r\nbound with ropes, two and two. Showers of taunts and jeers rained upon\r\nthem from all sides. One man asked one of the girls if she “didn’t feel\r\npretty to be caught running away,” and another asked her “if she wasn’t\r\nsorry.” She answered, “No, if it was to do again to-morrow, she would do\r\nthe same.” The man turned to a bystander and said, “Han’t she got good\r\nspunk?”\r\n\r\nBut the most vehement excitement was against Drayton and Sayres, the\r\ncaptain and mate of the vessel. Ruffians armed with dirk-knives and\r\npistols crowded around them, with the most horrid threats. One of them\r\nstruck so near Drayton as to cut his ear, which Emily noticed as\r\nbleeding. Meanwhile there mingled in the crowd multitudes of the\r\nrelatives of the captives, who, looking on them as so many doomed\r\nvictims, bewailed and lamented them. A brother-in-law of the Edmondsons\r\nwas so overcome when he saw them that he fainted away and fell down in\r\nthe street, and was carried home insensible. The sorrowful news spread\r\nto the cottage of Paul and Milly Edmondson; and, knowing that all their\r\nchildren were now probably doomed to the southern market, they gave\r\nthemselves up to sorrow. “O! what a day that was!” said the old mother\r\nwhen describing that scene to the writer. “Never a morsel of anything\r\ncould I put into my mouth. Paul and me we fasted and prayed before the\r\nLord, night and day, for our poor children.”\r\n\r\nThe whole public sentiment of the community was roused to the most\r\nintense indignation. It was repeated from mouth to mouth that they had\r\nbeen kindly treated and never abused; and what could have induced them\r\nto try to get their liberty? All that Mr. Stanton had said of the\r\ninsensible influence of American institutions, and all his pretty\r\nsimiles about the cotton-wood seeds, seemed entirely to have escaped the\r\nmemory of the community, and they could see nothing but the most\r\nunheard-of depravity in the attempt of these people to secure freedom.\r\nIt was strenuously advised by many that their owners should not forgive\r\nthem,—that no mercy should be shown, but that they should be thrown into\r\nthe hands of the traders, forthwith, for the southern market,—that\r\nSiberia of the irresponsible despots of America.\r\n\r\nWhen all the prisoners were lodged in jail, the owners came to make oath\r\nto their property, and the property also was required to make oath to\r\ntheir owners. Among them came the married sisters of Mary and Emily, but\r\nwere not allowed to enter the prison. The girls looked through the iron\r\ngrates of the third-story windows, and saw their sisters standing below\r\nin the yard weeping.\r\n\r\nThe guardian of the Edmondsons, who acted in the place of the real\r\nowner, apparently touched with their sorrow, promised their family and\r\nfriends, who were anxious to purchase them, if possible, that they\r\nshould have an opportunity the next morning. Perhaps he intended at the\r\ntime to give them one; but, as Bruin and Hill, the keepers of the large\r\nslave warehouse in Alexandria, offered him four thousand five hundred\r\ndollars for the six children, they were irrevocably sold before the next\r\nmorning. Bruin would listen to no terms which any of their friends could\r\npropose. The lady with whom Mary had lived offered a thousand dollars\r\nfor her; but Bruin refused, saying he could get double that sum in the\r\nNew Orleans market. He said he had had his eye upon the family for\r\ntwelve years, and had the promise of them should they ever be sold.\r\n\r\nWhile the girls remained in the prison they had no beds or chairs, and\r\nonly one blanket each, though the nights were chilly; but, understanding\r\nthat the rooms below, where their brothers were confined, were still\r\ncolder, and that no blankets were given them, they sent their own down\r\nto them. In the morning they were allowed to go down into the yard for a\r\nfew moments; and then they used to run to the window of their brothers’\r\nroom, to bid them good-morning, and kiss them through the grate.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock, Thursday night, the brothers were handcuffed, and, with\r\ntheir sisters, taken into carriages by their new owners, driven to\r\nAlexandria, and put into a prison called a Georgia Pen. The girls were\r\nput into a large room alone, in total darkness, without bed or blanket,\r\nwhere they spent the night in sobs and tears, in utter ignorance of\r\ntheir brothers’ fate. At eight o’clock in the morning they were called\r\nto breakfast, when, to their great comfort, they found their four\r\nbrothers all in the same prison.\r\n\r\nThey remained here about four weeks, being usually permitted by day to\r\nstay below with their brothers, and at night to return to their own\r\nrooms. Their brothers had great anxieties about them, fearing they would\r\nbe sold south. Samuel, in particular, felt very sadly, as he had been\r\nthe principal actor in getting them away. He often said he would gladly\r\n_die_ for them, if that would save them from the fate he feared. He used\r\nto weep a great deal, though he endeavored to restrain his tears in\r\ntheir presence.\r\n\r\nWhile in the slave-prison they were required to wash for thirteen men,\r\nthough their brothers performed a great share of the labor. Before they\r\nleft, their size and height were measured by their owners. At length\r\nthey were again taken out, the brothers handcuffed, and all put on board\r\na steamboat, where were about forty slaves, mostly men, and taken to\r\nBaltimore. The voyage occupied one day and a night. When arrived in\r\nBaltimore, they were thrown into a slave-pen kept by a partner of Bruin\r\nand Hill. He was a man of coarse habits, constantly using the most\r\nprofane language, and grossly obscene and insulting in his remarks to\r\nwomen. Here they were forbidden to pray together, as they had previously\r\nbeen accustomed to do. But, by rising very early in the morning, they\r\nsecured to themselves a little interval which they could employ,\r\nuninterrupted, in this manner. They, with four or five other women in\r\nthe prison, used to meet together, before daybreak, to spread their\r\nsorrows before the Refuge of the afflicted; and in these prayers the\r\nhard-hearted slave-dealer was daily remembered. The brothers of Mary and\r\nEmily were very gentle and tender in their treatment of their sisters,\r\nwhich had an influence upon other men in their company.\r\n\r\nAt this place they became acquainted with Aunt Rachel, a most godly\r\nwoman, about middle age, who had been sold into the prison away from her\r\nhusband. The poor husband used often to come to the prison and beg the\r\ntrader to sell her to _his_ owners, who he thought were willing to\r\npurchase her, if the price was not too high. But he was driven off with\r\nbrutal threats and curses. They remained in Baltimore about three weeks.\r\n\r\nThe friends in Washington, though hitherto unsuccessful in their efforts\r\nto redeem the family, were still exerting themselves in their behalf;\r\nand one evening a message was received from them by telegraph, stating\r\nthat a person would arrive in the morning train of cars prepared to\r\nbargain for the family, and that a part of the money was now ready. But\r\nthe trader was inexorable, and in the morning, an hour before the cars\r\nwere to arrive, they were all put on board the brig _Union_, ready to\r\nsail for New Orleans. The messenger came, and brought nine hundred\r\ndollars in money, the gift of a grandson of John Jacob Astor. This was\r\nfinally appropriated to the ransom of Richard Edmondson, as his wife and\r\nchildren were said to be suffering in Washington; and the trader would\r\nnot sell the girls to them upon any consideration, nor would he even\r\nsuffer Richard to be brought back from the brig, which had not yet\r\nsailed. The bargain was, however, made, and the money deposited in\r\nBaltimore.\r\n\r\nOn this brig the eleven women were put in one small apartment, and the\r\nthirty or forty men in an adjoining one. Emily was very sea-sick most of\r\nthe time, and her brothers feared she would die. They used to come and\r\ncarry her out on deck and back again, buy little comforts for their\r\nsisters, and take all possible care of them.\r\n\r\nFrequently head winds blew them back, so that they made very slow\r\nprogress; and in their prayer-meetings, which they held every night,\r\nthey used to pray that head winds might blow them to New York; and one\r\nof the sailors declared that if they could get within one hundred miles\r\nof New York, and the slaves would stand by him, he would make way with\r\nthe captain, and pilot them into New York himself.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived near Key West, they hoisted a signal for a pilot, the\r\ncaptain being aware of the dangers of the place, and yet not knowing how\r\nto avoid them. As the pilot-boat approached, the slaves were all\r\nfastened below, and a heavy canvas thrown over the grated hatchway door,\r\nwhich entirely excluded all circulation of air, and almost produced\r\nsuffocation. The captain and pilot had a long talk about the price, and\r\nsome altercation ensued, the captain not being willing to give the price\r\ndemanded by the pilot; during which time there was great suffering\r\nbelow. The women became so exhausted that they were mostly helpless; and\r\nthe situation of the men was not much better, though they managed with a\r\nstick to break some holes through the canvas on their side, so as to let\r\nin a little air, but a few only of the strongest could get there to\r\nenjoy it. Some of them shouted for help as long as their strength would\r\npermit; and at length, after what seemed to them an almost interminable\r\ninterview, the pilot left, refusing to assist them; the canvas was\r\nremoved, and the brig obliged to turn tack, and take another course.\r\nThen, one after another, as they got air and strength, crawled out on\r\ndeck. Mary and Emily were carried out by their brothers as soon as they\r\nwere able to do it.\r\n\r\nSoon after this the stock of provisions ran low, and the water failed,\r\nso that the slaves were restricted to a gill a day. The sailors were\r\nallowed a quart each, and often gave a pint of it to one of the\r\nEdmondsons for their sisters; and they divided it with the other women,\r\nas they always did every nice thing they got in such ways.\r\n\r\nThe day they arrived at the mouth of the Mississippi a terrible storm\r\narose, and the waves rolled mountain high, so that, when the pilot-boat\r\napproached, it would sometimes seem to be entirely swallowed by the\r\nwaves, and again it would emerge, and again appear wholly buried. At\r\nlength they were towed into and up the river by a steamer, and there,\r\nfor the first time, saw cotton plantations, and gangs of slaves at work\r\non them.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at New Orleans in the night, and about ten the next day\r\nwere landed and marched to what they called the show-rooms, and, going\r\nout into the yard, saw a great many men and women sitting around, with\r\nsuch sad faces that Emily soon began to cry, upon which an overseer\r\nstepped up and struck her on the chin, and bade her “stop crying, or he\r\nwould give her something to cry about.” Then pointing, he told her\r\n“there was the calaboose, where they whipped those who did not behave\r\nthemselves!” As soon as he turned away, a slave-woman came and told her\r\nto look cheerful, if she possibly could, as it would be far better for\r\nher. One of her brothers soon came to inquire what the woman had been\r\nsaying to her; and when informed, encouraged Emily to follow the advice,\r\nand endeavored to profit by it himself.\r\n\r\nThat night all the four brothers had their hair cut close, their\r\nmustaches shaved off, and their usual clothing exchanged for a blue\r\njacket and pants, all of which so altered their appearance that at first\r\ntheir sisters did not know them. Then, for three successive days, they\r\nwere all obliged to stand in an open porch fronting the street, for\r\npassers by to look at, except, when one was tired out, she might go in\r\nfor a little time, and another take her place. Whenever buyers called,\r\nthey were paraded in the auction-room in rows, exposed to coarse jokes\r\nand taunts. When any one took a liking to any girl in the company, he\r\nwould call her to him, take hold of her, open her mouth, look at her\r\nteeth, and handle her person rudely, frequently making obscene remarks;\r\nand she must stand and bear it, without resistance. Mary and Emily\r\ncomplained to their brothers that they could not submit to such\r\ntreatment. They conversed about it with Wilson, a partner of Bruin and\r\nHill, who had the charge of the slaves at this prison. After this they\r\nwere treated with more decency.\r\n\r\nAnother brother of the girls, named Hamilton, had been a slave in or\r\nnear New Orleans for sixteen years, and had just purchased his own\r\nfreedom for one thousand dollars; having once before earned that sum for\r\nhimself, and then had it taken from him. Richard being now really free,\r\nas the money was deposited in Baltimore for his ransom, found him out\r\nthe next day after their arrival at New Orleans, and brought him to the\r\nprison to see his brothers and sisters. The meeting was overpoweringly\r\naffecting.\r\n\r\nHe had never before seen his sister Emily, as he had been sold away from\r\nhis parents before her birth.\r\n\r\nThe girls’ lodging-room was occupied at night by about twenty or thirty\r\nwomen, who all slept on the bare floor, with only a blanket each. After\r\na few days, word was received (which was _really incorrect_), that half\r\nthe money had been raised for the redemption of Mary and Emily. After\r\nthis they were allowed, upon their brothers’ earnest request, to go to\r\ntheir free brother’s house and spend their nights, and return in the\r\nmornings, as they had suffered greatly from the mosquitos and other\r\ninsects, and their feet were swollen and sore.\r\n\r\nWhile at this prison, some horrible cases of cruelty came to their\r\nknowledge, and some of them under their own observation. Two persons,\r\none woman and one boy, were whipped to death in the prison while they\r\nwere there, though they were not in the same pen, or owned by the same\r\ntrader, as themselves.\r\n\r\nNone of the slaves were allowed to sleep in the day-time, and sometimes\r\nlittle children sitting or standing idle all day would become so sleepy\r\nas not to be able to hold up their eyelids; but, if they were caught\r\nthus by the overseer, they were cruelly beaten. Mary and Emily used to\r\nwatch the little ones, and let them sleep until they heard the overseers\r\ncoming, and then spring and rouse them in a moment.\r\n\r\nOne young woman, who had been sold by the traders for the worst of\r\npurposes, was returned, not being fortunate (?) enough to suit her\r\npurchaser; and, as is their custom in such cases, was most cruelly\r\nflogged,—so much so that some of her flesh mortified, and her life was\r\ndespaired of. When Mary and Emily first arrived at New Orleans they saw\r\nand conversed with her. She was then just beginning to sit up; was quite\r\nsmall, and very fine-looking, with beautiful straight hair, which was\r\nformerly long, but had been cut off short by her brutal tormentors.\r\n\r\nThe overseer who flogged her said, in their hearing, that he would never\r\nflog another girl in that way—it was too much for any one to bear. They\r\nsuggest that perhaps the reason why he promised this was because he was\r\nobliged to be her nurse, and of course saw her sufferings. She was from\r\nAlexandria, but they have forgotten her name.\r\n\r\nOne young man and woman of their company in the prison, who were engaged\r\nto be married, and were sold to different owners, felt so distressed at\r\ntheir separation that they could not or did not labor well; and the\r\nyoung man was soon sent back, with the complaint that he would not\r\nanswer the purpose. Of course, the money was to be refunded, and he\r\nflogged. He was condemned to be flogged each night for a week; and,\r\nafter about two hundred lashes by the overseer, each one of the male\r\nslaves in the prison was required to come and lay on five lashes with\r\nall his strength, upon penalty of being flogged himself. The young\r\nwoman, too, was soon sent there, with a note from her new mistress,\r\nrequesting that she might be whipped a certain number of lashes, and\r\nenclosing the money to pay for it; which request was readily complied\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nWhile in New Orleans they saw gangs of women cleaning the streets,\r\nchained together, some with a heavy iron ball attached to the chain; a\r\nform of punishment frequently resorted to for household servants who had\r\ndispleased their mistresses.\r\n\r\nHamilton Edmondson, the brother who had purchased his own freedom, made\r\ngreat efforts to get good homes for his brothers and sisters in New\r\nOrleans, so that they need not be far separated from each other. One\r\nday, Mr. Wilson, the overseer, took Samuel away with him in a carriage,\r\nand returned without him. The brothers and sisters soon found that he\r\nwas sold, and gone they knew not whither; but they were not allowed to\r\nweep, or even look sad, upon pain of severe punishment. The next day,\r\nhowever, to their great joy, he came to the prison himself, and told\r\nthem he had a good home in the city with an Englishman, who had paid a\r\nthousand dollars for him.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining about three weeks in this prison, the Edmondsons were\r\ntold that, in consequence of the prevalence of the yellow fever in the\r\ncity, together with the fact of their not being acclimated, it was\r\ndeemed dangerous for them to remain there longer;—and, besides this,\r\npurchasers were loth to give good prices under these circumstances. Some\r\nof the slaves in the pen were already sick; some of them old, poor or\r\ndirty, and for these reasons greatly exposed to sickness. Richard\r\nEdmondson had already been ransomed, and must be sent back; and, upon\r\nthe whole, it was thought best to fit out and send off a gang to\r\nBaltimore, without delay.\r\n\r\nThe Edmondsons received these tidings with joyful hearts, for they had\r\nnot yet been undeceived with regard to the raising of the money for\r\ntheir ransom. Their brother who was free procured for them many comforts\r\nfor the voyage, such as a mattress, blankets, sheets and different kinds\r\nof food and drink; and, accompanied to the vessel by their friends\r\nthere, they embarked on the brig Union just at night, and were towed out\r\nof the river. The brig had nearly a full cargo of cotton, molasses,\r\nsugar, &c., and, of course, the space for the slaves was exceedingly\r\nlimited. The place allotted the females was a little close, filthy room,\r\nperhaps eight or ten feet square, filled with cotton within two or three\r\nfeet of the top of the room, except the space directly under the\r\nhatchway door. Richard Edmondson kept his sisters upon deck with him,\r\nthough without a shelter; prepared their food himself, made up their bed\r\nat night on the top of barrels, or wherever he could find a place, and\r\nthen slept by their side. Sometimes a storm would arise in the middle of\r\nthe night, when he would spring up and wake them, and, gathering up\r\ntheir bed and bedding, conduct them to a little kind of a pantry, where\r\nthey could all three just stand, till the storm passed away. Sometimes\r\nhe contrived to make a temporary shelter for them out of bits of boards,\r\nor something else on deck.\r\n\r\nAfter a voyage of sixteen days, they arrived at Baltimore, fully\r\nexpecting that their days of slavery were numbered. Here they were\r\nconducted back to the same old prison from which they had been taken a\r\nfew weeks before, though they supposed it would be but for an hour or\r\ntwo. Presently Mr. Bigelow, of Washington, came for Richard. When the\r\ngirls found that they were not to be set free too, their grief and\r\ndisappointment were unspeakable. But they were _separated_,—Richard to\r\ngo to his home, his wife and children, and they to remain in the\r\nslave-prison. Wearisome days and nights again rolled on. In the mornings\r\nthey were obliged to march round the yard to the music of fiddles,\r\nbanjoes, &c.; in the day-time they washed and ironed for the male\r\nslaves, slept some, and wept a great deal. After a few weeks their\r\nfather came to visit them, accompanied by their sister.\r\n\r\nHis object was partly to ascertain what were the very lowest terms upon\r\nwhich their keeper would sell the girls, as he indulged a faint hope\r\nthat in some way or other the money might be raised, if time enough were\r\nallowed. The trader declared he should soon send them to some other\r\nslave-market, but he would wait two weeks, and, if the friends could\r\nraise the money in that time, they might have them.\r\n\r\nThe night their father and sister spent in the prison with them, he lay\r\nin the room over their heads; and they could hear him groan all night,\r\nwhile their sister was weeping by their side. None of them closed their\r\neyes in sleep.\r\n\r\nIn the morning came again the wearisome routine of the slave-prison. Old\r\nPaul walked quietly into the yard, and sat down to see the poor slaves\r\nmarched around. He had never seen his daughters in such circumstances\r\nbefore, and his feelings quite overcame him. The yard was narrow, and\r\nthe girls, as they walked by him, almost brushing him with their\r\nclothes, could just hear him groaning within himself, “O, my children,\r\nmy children!”\r\n\r\nAfter the breakfast, which none of them were able to eat, they parted\r\nwith sad hearts, the father begging the keeper to send them to New\r\nOrleans, if the money could not be raised, as perhaps their brothers\r\nthere might secure for them kind masters.\r\n\r\nTwo or three weeks afterwards Bruin & Hill visited the prison, dissolved\r\npartnership with the trader, settled accounts, and took the Edmondsons\r\nagain in their own possession.\r\n\r\nThe girls were roused about eleven o’clock at night, after they had\r\nfallen asleep, and told to get up directly, and prepare for going home.\r\nThey had learned that the word of a slave-holder is not to be trusted,\r\nand feared they were going to be sent to Richmond, Virginia, as there\r\nhad been talk of it. They were soon on their way in the cars with Bruin,\r\nand arrived at Washington at a little past midnight.\r\n\r\nTheir hearts throbbed high when, after these long months of weary\r\ncaptivity, they found themselves once more in the city where were their\r\nbrothers, sisters and parents. But they were permitted to see none of\r\nthem, and were put into a carriage and driven immediately to the\r\nslave-prison at Alexandria, where, about two o’clock at night, they\r\nfound themselves in the same forlorn old room in which they had begun\r\ntheir term of captivity!\r\n\r\nThis was the latter part of August. Again they were employed in washing,\r\nironing and sewing by day, and always locked up by night. Sometimes they\r\nwere allowed to sew in Bruin’s house, and even to eat there. After they\r\nhad been in Alexandria two or three weeks, their eldest married sister,\r\nnot having heard from them for some time, came to see Bruin, to learn,\r\nif possible, something of their fate; and her surprise and joy were\r\ngreat to see them once more, even there. After a few weeks their old\r\nfather came again to see them. Hopeless as the idea of their\r\nemancipation seemed, he still clung to it. He had had some encouragement\r\nof assistance in Washington, and he purposed to go North to see if\r\nanything could be done there; and he was anxious to obtain from Bruin\r\nwhat were the very lowest possible terms for which he would sell the\r\ngirls. Bruin drew up his terms in the following document, which we\r\nsubjoin:\r\n\r\n                                     _Alexandria, Va., Sept. 5, 1848._\r\n\r\n  The bearer, Paul Edmondson, is the father of two girls, Mary Jane\r\n  and Emily Catharine Edmondson. These girls have been purchased by\r\n  us, and once sent to the south; and, upon the positive assurance\r\n  that the money for them would be raised if they were brought back,\r\n  they were returned. Nothing, it appears, has as yet been done in\r\n  this respect by those who promised, and we are on the very eve of\r\n  sending them south the second time; and we are candid in saying\r\n  that, if they go again, we will not regard any promises made in\r\n  relation to them. The father wishes to raise money to pay for them;\r\n  and intends to appeal to the liberality of the humane and the good\r\n  to aid him, and has requested us to state in writing _the conditions\r\n  upon which we will sell his daughters_.\r\n\r\n  We expect to start our servants to the south in a few days; if the\r\n  sum of twelve hundred ($1200) dollars be raised and paid to us in\r\n  fifteen days, or we be assured of that sum, then we will retain them\r\n  for twenty-five days more, to give an opportunity for the raising of\r\n  the other thousand and fifty ($1050) dollars; otherwise we shall be\r\n  compelled to send them along with our other servants.\r\n\r\n                                                         BRUIN & HILL.\r\n\r\nPaul took his papers, and parted from his daughters sorrowfully. After\r\nthis, the time to the girls dragged on in heavy suspense. Constantly\r\nthey looked for letter or message, and prayed to God to raise them up a\r\ndeliverer from some quarter. But day after day and week after week\r\npassed, and the dreaded time drew near. The preliminaries for fitting up\r\nthe gang for South Carolina commenced. Gay calico was bought for them to\r\nmake up into “show dresses,” in which they were to be exhibited on sale.\r\nThey made them up with far sadder feelings than they would have sewed on\r\ntheir own shrouds. Hope had almost died out of their bosoms. A few days\r\nbefore the gang were to be sent off, their sister made them a sad\r\nfarewell visit. They mingled their prayers and tears, and the girls made\r\nup little tokens of remembrance to send by her as parting gifts to their\r\nbrothers and sisters and aged father and mother, and with a farewell\r\nsadder than that of a death-bed the sisters parted.\r\n\r\nThe evening before the coffle was to start drew on. Mary and Emily went\r\nto the house to bid Bruin’s family good-by. Bruin had a little daughter\r\nwho had been a pet and favorite with the girls. She clung round them,\r\ncried, and begged them not to go. Emily told her that, if she wished to\r\nhave them stay, she must go and ask her father. Away ran the little\r\npleader, full of her errand; and was so very earnest in her\r\nimportunities, that he, to pacify her, said he would consent to their\r\nremaining, if his partner, Captain Hill, would do so. At this time\r\nBruin, hearing Mary crying aloud in the prison, went up to see her. With\r\nall the earnestness of despair, she made her last appeal to his\r\nfeelings. She begged him to make the case his own, to think of his own\r\ndear little daughter,—what if she were exposed to be torn away from\r\nevery friend on earth, and cut off from all hope of redemption, at the\r\nvery moment, too, when deliverance was expected! Bruin was not\r\nabsolutely a man of stone, and this agonizing appeal brought tears to\r\nhis eyes. He gave some encouragement that, if Hill would consent, they\r\nneed not be sent off with the gang. A sleepless night followed, spent in\r\nweeping, groaning and prayer. Morning at last dawned, and, according to\r\norders received the day before, they prepared themselves to go, and even\r\nput on their bonnets and shawls, and stood ready for the word to be\r\ngiven. When the very last tear of hope was shed, and they were going out\r\nto join the gang, Bruin’s heart relented. He called them to him, and\r\ntold them they might remain! O, how glad were their hearts made by this,\r\nas they might _now_ hope on a little longer! Either the entreaties of\r\nlittle Martha or Mary’s plea with Bruin had prevailed.\r\n\r\nSoon the gang was started on foot,—men, women and children, two and two,\r\nthe men all handcuffed together, the right wrist of one to the left\r\nwrist of the other, and a chain passing through the middle from the\r\nhandcuffs of one couple to those of the next. The women and children\r\nwalked in the same manner throughout, handcuffed or chained. Drivers\r\nwent before and at the side, to take up those who were sick or lame.\r\nThey were obliged to set off _singing_! accompanied with fiddles and\r\nbanjoes!—“_For they that carried us away captive required of us a song,\r\nand they that wasted us required of us mirth._” And this is a scene of\r\ndaily occurrence in a Christian country!—and Christian ministers say\r\nthat the right to do these things is _given by God himself_!!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile poor old Paul Edmondson went northward to supplicate aid. Any\r\none who should have travelled in the cars at that time might have seen a\r\nvenerable-looking black man, all whose air and attitude indicated a\r\npatient humility, and who seemed to carry a weight of overwhelming\r\nsorrow, like one who had long been acquainted with grief. That man was\r\nPaul Edmondson.\r\n\r\nAlone, friendless, unknown, and, worst of all, black, he came into the\r\ngreat bustling city of New York, to see if there was any one there who\r\ncould give him twenty-five hundred dollars to buy his daughters with.\r\nCan anybody realize what a poor man’s feelings are, who visits a great,\r\nbustling, rich city, alone and unknown, for such an object? The writer\r\nhas now, in a letter from a slave father and husband who was visiting\r\nPortland on a similar errand, a touching expression of it:\r\n\r\n  I walked all day, till I was tired and discouraged. O! Mrs. S——,\r\n  when I see so many people who seem to have so many more things than\r\n  they want or know what to do with, and then think that I have worked\r\n  hard, till I am past forty, all my life, and don’t own even my own\r\n  wife and children, it makes me feel sick and discouraged!\r\n\r\nSo sick at heart and discouraged felt Paul Edmondson. He went to the\r\nAnti-Slavery Office, and made his case known. The sum was such a large\r\none, and seemed to many so exorbitant, that, though they pitied the poor\r\nfather, they were disheartened about raising it. They wrote to\r\nWashington to authenticate the particulars of the story, and wrote to\r\nBruin and Hill to see if there could be any reduction of price.\r\nMeanwhile, the poor old man looked sadly from one adviser to another. He\r\nwas recommended to go to the Rev. H. W. Beecher, and tell his story. He\r\ninquired his way to his door,—ascended the steps to ring the door-bell,\r\nbut his heart failed him,—he sat down on the steps weeping!\r\n\r\nThere Mr. Beecher found him. He took him in, and inquired his story.\r\nThere was to be a public meeting that night, to raise money. The hapless\r\nfather begged him to go and plead for his children. He did go, and spoke\r\nas if he were pleading for his own father and sisters. Other clergymen\r\nfollowed in the same strain,—the meeting became enthusiastic, and the\r\nmoney was raised on the spot, and poor old Paul laid his head that night\r\non a grateful pillow,—not to sleep, but to give thanks!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the girls had been dragging on anxious days in the\r\nslave-prison. They were employed in sewing for Bruin’s family, staying\r\nsometimes in the prison and sometimes in the house.\r\n\r\nIt is to be stated here that Mr. Bruin is a man of very different\r\ncharacter from many in his trade. He is such a man as never would have\r\nbeen found in the profession of a slave-trader, had not the most\r\nrespectable and religious part of the community defended the right to\r\nbuy and sell, as being conferred by God himself. It is a fact, with\r\nregard to this man, that he was one of the earliest subscribers to the\r\n_National Era_, in the District of Columbia; and, when a certain\r\nindividual there brought himself into great peril by assisting fugitive\r\nslaves, and there was no one found to go bail for him, Mr. Bruin came\r\nforward and performed this kindness.\r\n\r\nWhile we abhor the horrible system and the horrible trade with our whole\r\nsoul, there is no harm, we suppose, in wishing that such a man had a\r\nbetter occupation. Yet we cannot forbear reminding all such that, when\r\nwe come to give our account at the judgment-seat of Christ, every man\r\nmust speak _for himself alone_; and that Christ will not accept as an\r\napology for sin the word of all the ministers and all the synods in the\r\ncountry. He has given fair warning, “Beware of false prophets;” and if\r\npeople will not beware of them, their blood is upon their own heads.\r\n\r\nThe girls, while under Mr. Bruin’s care, were treated with as much\r\nkindness and consideration as could possibly consist with the design of\r\nselling them. There is no doubt that Bruin was personally friendly to\r\nthem, and really wished most earnestly that they might be ransomed; but\r\nthen he did not see how he was to lose two thousand five hundred\r\ndollars. He had just the same difficulty on this subject that some New\r\nYork members of churches have had, when they have had slaves brought\r\ninto their hands as security for Southern debts. He was sorry for them,\r\nand wished them well, and hoped Providence would provide for them when\r\nthey were sold, but still he could not afford to lose his money; and\r\nwhile such men remain elders and communicants in churches in New York,\r\nwe must not be surprised that there remain slave-traders in Alexandria.\r\n\r\nIt is one great art of the enemy of souls to lead men to compound for\r\ntheir participation in one branch of sin by their righteous horror of\r\nanother. The slave-trader has been the general scape-goat on whom all\r\nparties have vented their indignation, while buying of him and selling\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nThere is an awful warning given in the fiftieth Psalm to those who in\r\nword have professed religion and in deed consented to iniquity, where\r\nfrom the judgment-seat Christ is represented as thus addressing them:\r\n“What hast _thou_ to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldst\r\ntake my covenant into thy mouth, seeing thou hatest instruction, and\r\ncastest my words behind thee? When thou sawest a thief, then thou\r\nconsentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.”\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain, that all who do these things, openly or secretly,\r\nmust, at last, make up their account with a Judge who is no respecter of\r\npersons, and who will just as soon condemn an elder in the church for\r\nslave-trading as a professed trader; nay, He may make it more tolerable\r\nfor the Sodom and Gomorrah of the trade than for them,—for it may be, if\r\nthe trader had the means of grace that they have had, that he would have\r\nrepented long ago.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our history.—The girls were sitting sewing near the\r\nopen window of their cage, when Emily said to Mary, “There, Mary, is\r\nthat white man we have seen from the North.” They both looked, and in a\r\nmoment more saw their own dear father. They sprang and ran through the\r\nhouse and the office, and into the street, shouting as they ran,\r\nfollowed by Bruin, who said he thought the girls were crazy. In a moment\r\nthey were in their father’s arms, but observed that he trembled\r\nexceedingly, and that his voice was unsteady. They eagerly inquired if\r\nthe money was raised for their ransom. Afraid of exciting their hopes\r\ntoo soon, before their free papers were signed, he said he would talk\r\nwith them soon, and went into the office with Mr. Bruin and Mr. Chaplin.\r\nMr. Bruin professed himself sincerely glad, as undoubtedly he was, that\r\nthey had brought the money; but seemed much hurt by the manner in which\r\nhe had been spoken of by the Rev. H. W. Beecher at the liberation\r\nmeeting in New York, thinking it hard that no difference should be made\r\nbetween him and other traders, when he had shown himself so much more\r\nconsiderate and humane than the great body of them. He, however, counted\r\nover the money and signed the papers with great good will, taking out a\r\nfive-dollar gold piece for each of the girls, as a parting present.\r\n\r\nThe affair took longer than they supposed, and the time seemed an age to\r\nthe poor girls, who were anxiously walking up and down outside the room,\r\nin ignorance of their fate. Could their father have brought the money?\r\nWhy did he tremble so? Could he have failed of the money, at last? Or\r\ncould it be that their dear mother was dead, for they had heard that she\r\nwas very ill!\r\n\r\nAt length a messenger came shouting to them, “You are free, you are\r\nfree!” Emily thinks she sprang nearly to the ceiling overhead. They\r\njumped, clapped their hands, laughed and shouted aloud. Soon their\r\nfather came to them, embraced them tenderly and attempted to quiet them,\r\nand told them to prepare them to go and see their mother. This they did\r\nthey know not how, but with considerable help from the family, who all\r\nseemed to rejoice in their joy. Their father procured a carriage to take\r\nthem to the wharf, and, with joy overflowing all bounds, they bade a\r\nmost affectionate farewell to each member of the family, not even\r\nomitting Bruin himself. The “good that there is in human nature” for\r\nonce had the upper hand, and all were moved to tears of sympathetic joy.\r\nTheir father, with subdued tenderness, made great efforts to soothe\r\ntheir tumultuous feelings, and at length partially succeeded. When they\r\narrived at Washington, a carriage was ready to take them to their\r\nsister’s house. People of every rank and description came running\r\ntogether to get a sight of them. Their brothers caught them up in their\r\narms, and ran about with them, almost frantic with joy. Their aged and\r\nvenerated mother, raised up from a sick bed by the stimulus of the glad\r\nnews, was there, weeping and giving thanks to God. Refreshments were\r\nprepared in their sister’s house for all who called, and amid greetings\r\nand rejoicings, tears and gladness, prayers and thanksgivings, but\r\nwithout sleep, the night passed away, and the morning of November 4,\r\n1848, dawned upon them free and happy.\r\n\r\nThis last spring, during the month of May, as the writer has already\r\nintimated, the aged mother of the Edmondson family came on to New York,\r\nand the reason of her coming may be thus briefly explained. She had\r\nstill one other daughter, the guide and support of her feeble age, or,\r\nas she calls her in her own expressive language, “the last drop of blood\r\nin her heart.” She had also a son, twenty-one years of age, still a\r\nslave on a neighboring plantation. The infirm woman in whose name the\r\nestate was held was supposed to be drawing near to death, and the poor\r\nparents were distressed with the fear that, in case of this event, their\r\ntwo remaining children would be sold for the purpose of dividing the\r\nestate, and thus thrown into the dreaded southern market. No one can\r\nrealize what a constant horror the slave-prisons and the slave-traders\r\nare to all the unfortunate families in the vicinity. Everything for\r\nwhich other parents look on their children with pleasure and pride is to\r\nthese poor souls a source of anxiety and dismay, because it renders the\r\nchild so much more a merchantable article.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder, therefore, that the light in Paul and Milly’s cottage\r\nwas overshadowed by this terrible idea.\r\n\r\nThe guardians of these children had given their father a written promise\r\nto sell them to him for a certain sum, and by hard begging he had\r\nacquired a hundred dollars towards the twelve hundred which were\r\nnecessary. But he was now confined to his bed with sickness. After\r\npouring out earnest prayers to the Helper of the helpless, Milly says,\r\none day she said to Paul, “I tell ye, Paul, I’m going up to New York\r\nmyself, to see if I can’t get that money.”\r\n\r\n“Paul says to me, ‘Why, Milly dear, how can you? Ye an’t fit to be off\r\nthe bed, and ye’s never in the cars in your life.’\r\n\r\n“‘Never you fear, Paul,’ says I; ‘I shall go trusting in the Lord; and\r\nthe Lord, He’ll take me, and He’ll bring me,—that I know.’\r\n\r\n“So I went to the cars and got a white man to put me aboard; and, sure\r\nenough, there I found two Bethel ministers; and one set one side o’ me,\r\nand one set the other, all the way; and they got me my tickets, and\r\nlooked after my things, and did every thing for me. There didn’t\r\nanything happen to me all the way. Sometimes, when I went to set down in\r\nthe sitting-rooms, people looked at me and moved off so scornful! Well,\r\nI thought, I wish the Lord would give you a better mind.”\r\n\r\nEmily and Mary, who had been at school in New York State, came to the\r\ncity to meet their mother, and they brought her directly to the Rev.\r\nHenry W. Beecher’s house, where the writer then was.\r\n\r\nThe writer remembers now the scene when she first met this mother and\r\ndaughters. It must be recollected that they had not seen each other\r\nbefore for four years. One was sitting each side the mother, holding her\r\nhand; and the air of pride and filial affection with which they\r\npresented her was touching to behold. After being presented to the\r\nwriter, she again sat down between them, took a hand of each, and looked\r\nvery earnestly first on one and then on the other; and then, looking up,\r\nsaid, with a smile, “O, these children,—how they do lie round our\r\nhearts!”\r\n\r\nShe then explained to the writer all her sorrows and anxieties for the\r\nyounger children. “Now, madam,” she says, “that man that keeps the great\r\ntrading-house at Alexandria, _that man_,” she said, with a strong,\r\nindignant expression, “has sent to know if there’s any more of my\r\nchildren to be sold. That man said he wanted to see _me_! Yes, ma’am, he\r\nsaid he’d give twenty dollars to see me. I wouldn’t see him, if he’d\r\ngive me a hundred! He sent for me to come and see him, when he had my\r\ndaughters in his prison. I wouldn’t go to see him,—I didn’t want to see\r\nthem there!”\r\n\r\nThe two daughters, Emily and Mary, here became very much excited, and\r\nbroke out in some very natural but bitter language against all\r\nslave-holders. “Hush, children! you must forgive your enemies,” she\r\nsaid. “But they’re so wicked!” said the girls. “Ah, children, you must\r\nhate the _sin_, but love the _sinner_.” “Well,” said one of the girls,\r\n“mother, if I was taken again and made a slave of, I’d kill myself.” “I\r\ntrust not, child,—that would be wicked.” “But, mother, I _should_; I\r\nknow I never could bear it.” “Bear it, my child?” she answered, “it’s\r\nthey that bears the sorrow here is they that has the glories there.”\r\n\r\nThere was a deep, indescribable pathos of voice and manner as she said\r\nthese words,—a solemnity and force, and yet a sweetness, that can never\r\nbe forgotten.\r\n\r\nThis poor slave-mother, whose whole life had been one long outrage on\r\nher holiest feelings,—who had been kept from the power to read God’s\r\nWord, whose whole pilgrimage had been made one day of sorrow by the\r\ninjustice of a Christian nation,—she had yet learned to solve the\r\nhighest problem of Christian ethics, and to do what so few reformers can\r\ndo,—hate the _sin_, but love the _sinner_!\r\n\r\nA great deal of interest was excited among the ladies in Brooklyn by\r\nthis history. Several large meetings were held in different parlors, in\r\nwhich the old mother related her history with great simplicity and\r\npathos, and a subscription for the redemption of the remaining two of\r\nher family was soon on foot. It may be interesting to know that the\r\nsubscription list was headed by the lovely and benevolent Jenny Lind\r\nGoldschmidt.\r\n\r\nSome of the ladies who listened to this touching story were so much\r\ninterested in Mrs. Edmondson personally, they wished to have her\r\ndaguerreotype taken; both that they might be strengthened and refreshed\r\nby the sight of her placid countenance, and that they might see the\r\nbeauty of true goodness beaming there.\r\n\r\nShe accordingly went to the rooms with them, with all the simplicity of\r\na little child. “O,” said she, to one of the ladies, “you can’t think\r\nhow happy it’s made me to get here, where everybody is _so kind_ to me!\r\nWhy, last night, when I went home, I was so happy I couldn’t sleep. I\r\nhad to go and tell my Saviour, over and over again, how happy I was.”\r\n\r\nA lady spoke to her about reading something. “Law bless you, honey! I\r\ncan’t read a letter.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said another lady, “how have you learned so much of God, and\r\nheavenly things?”\r\n\r\n“Well, ‘pears like a _gift_ from above.”\r\n\r\n“Can you have the Bible read to you?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes; Paul, he reads a little, but then he has so much work all\r\nday, and when he gets home at night he’s so tired! and his eyes is bad.\r\nBut then the _Sperit_ teaches us.”\r\n\r\n“Do you go much to meeting?”\r\n\r\n“Not much now, we live so far. In winter I can’t never. But, O! what\r\nmeetings I have had, alone in the corner,—my Saviour and only me!” The\r\nsmile with which these words were spoken was a thing to be remembered. A\r\nlittle girl, daughter of one of the ladies, made some rather severe\r\nremarks about somebody in the daguerreotype rooms, and her mother\r\nchecked her.\r\n\r\nThe old lady looked up, with her placid smile. “That puts me in mind,”\r\nshe said, “of what I heard a preacher say once. ‘My friends,’ says he,\r\n‘if you know of anything that will make a brother’s heart glad, _run\r\nquick and tell it_; but if it is something that will only cause a sigh,\r\n‘bottle it up, bottle it up!’ O, I often tell my children, ‘Bottle it\r\nup, bottle it up!’”\r\n\r\nWhen the writer came to part with the old lady, she said to her: “Well,\r\ngood-by, my dear friend; remember and pray for me.”\r\n\r\n“Pray for _you_!” she said, earnestly. “Indeed I shall,—I can’t help\r\nit.” She then, raising her finger, said, in an emphatic tone, peculiar\r\nto the old of her race, “Tell you what! we never gets no good bread\r\nourselves till we begins _to ask for our brethren_.”\r\n\r\nThe writer takes this opportunity to inform all those friends, in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, who generously contributed for the\r\nredemption of these children, that they are _at last free_!\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the letter of a lady in Washington may be\r\ninteresting to them:\r\n\r\n  I have seen the Edmondson parents,—Paul and his wife Milly. I have\r\n  seen the _free_ Edmondsons,—mother, son, and daughter,—the very day\r\n  after the great era of _free life_ commenced, while yet the\r\n  inspiration was on them, while the mother’s face was all light and\r\n  love, the father’s eyes moistened and glistening with tears, the son\r\n  calm in conscious manhood and responsibility, the daughter (not more\r\n  than fifteen years old, I think) smiling a delightful appreciation\r\n  of joy in the present and hope in the future, thus suddenly and\r\n  completely unfolded.\r\n\r\nThus have we finished the account of one of the families who were taken\r\non board the _Pearl_. We have another history to give, to which we\r\ncannot promise so fortunate a termination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong those unfortunates guilty of loving freedom too well, was a\r\nbeautiful young quadroon girl, named Emily Russell, whose mother is now\r\nliving in New York. The writer has seen and conversed with her. She is a\r\npious woman, highly esteemed and respected, a member of a Christian\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nBy the avails of her own industry she purchased her freedom, and also\r\nredeemed from bondage some of her children. Emily was a resident of\r\nWashington, D. C., a place which belongs not to any state, but to the\r\nUnited States; and there, under the laws of the United States, she was\r\nheld as a slave. She was of a gentle disposition and amiable manners;\r\nshe had been early touched with a sense of religious things, and was on\r\nthe very point of uniting herself with a Christian church; but her heart\r\nyearned after her widowed mother and after freedom, and so, on the fatal\r\nnight when all the other poor victims sought the Pearl, the child Emily\r\nwent also among them.\r\n\r\nHow they were taken has already been told. The sin of the poor girl was\r\ninexpiable. Because she longed for her mother’s arms and for liberty,\r\nshe could not be forgiven. Nothing would do for such a sin, but to throw\r\nher into the hands of the trader. She also was thrown into Bruin &\r\nHill’s jail, in Alexandria. Her poor mother in New York received the\r\nfollowing letter from her. Read it, Christian mother, and think what if\r\nyour daughter had written it to you!\r\n\r\n  To Mrs. NANCY CARTWRIGHT, New York.\r\n\r\n                                          _Alexandria, Jan. 22, 1850._\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR MOTHER: I take this opportunity of writing you a few lines,\r\n  to inform you that I am in _Bruin’s Jail_, and Aunt Sally and all of\r\n  her children, and Aunt Hagar and all her children, and grandmother\r\n  is almost crazy. My dear mother, will you please to come on as soon\r\n  as you can? I expect to go away very shortly. O, mother! my dear\r\n  mother! come now and see your distressed and heart-broken daughter\r\n  once more. Mother! my dear mother! do not forsake me, for I feel\r\n  desolate! Please to come now.\r\n\r\n                                                Your daughter,\r\n                                                        EMILY RUSSELL.\r\n\r\n  P. S.—If you do not come as far as Alexandria, come to Washington,\r\n  and do what you can.\r\n\r\nThat letter, blotted and tear-soiled, was brought by this poor\r\nwasherwoman to some Christian friends in New York, and shown to them.\r\n“What do you suppose they will ask for her?” was her question. All that\r\nshe had,—her little house, her little furniture, her small earnings,—all\r\nthese poor Nancy was willing to throw in; but all these were but as a\r\ndrop to the bucket.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done, then, was to ascertain what Emily could be\r\nredeemed for; and, as it may be an interesting item of American trade,\r\nwe give the reply of the traders in full:\r\n\r\n                                          _Alexandria, Jan. 31, 1850._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR: When I received your letter I had not bought the negroes\r\n  you spoke of, but since that time I have bought them. All I have to\r\n  say about the matter is, that we paid very high for the negroes, and\r\n  cannot afford to sell the girl Emily for less than EIGHTEEN HUNDRED\r\n  DOLLARS. This may seem a high price to you, but, cotton being very\r\n  high, consequently slaves are high. We have two or three offers for\r\n  Emily from _gentlemen_ from the south. _She is said to be the\r\n  finest-looking woman in this country._ As for Hagar and her seven\r\n  children, we will take two thousand five hundred dollars for them.\r\n  Sally and her four children. We will take for them two thousand\r\n  eight hundred dollars. You may seem a little surprised at the\r\n  difference in prices, but the difference in the negroes makes the\r\n  difference in price. We expect to start south with the negroes on\r\n  the 8th February, and if you intend to do anything, you had better\r\n  do it soon.\r\n\r\n                                                 Yours, respectfully,\r\n                                                         BRUIN & HILL.\r\n\r\nThis letter came to New York before the case of the Edmondsons had\r\ncalled the attention of the community to this subject. The enormous\r\nprice asked entirely discouraged effort, and before anything of\r\nimportance was done they heard that the coffle had departed, with Emily\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nHear, O heavens! and give ear, O earth! Let it be known, in all the\r\ncountries of the earth, that the market-price of a beautiful Christian\r\ngirl in America is from EIGHTEEN HUNDRED to TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS; and\r\nyet, judicatories in the church of Christ have said, in solemn conclave,\r\nthat AMERICAN SLAVERY AS IT IS IS NO EVIL![22]\r\n\r\nFrom the table of the sacrament and from the sanctuary of the church of\r\nChrist this girl was torn away, because her beauty was a salable article\r\nin the slave-market in New Orleans!\r\n\r\nPerhaps some Northern apologist for slavery will say she was kindly\r\ntreated here—not handcuffed by the wrist to a chain, and forced to walk,\r\nas articles less choice are; that a wagon was provided, and that she\r\nrode; and that food abundant was given her to eat, and that her clothing\r\nwas warm and comfortable, and therefore no harm was done. We have heard\r\nit told us, again and again, that there is no harm in slavery, if one is\r\nonly warm enough, and full-fed, and comfortable. It is true that the\r\nslave-woman has no protection from the foulest dishonor and the utmost\r\ninsult that can be offered to womanhood,—none whatever in law or gospel;\r\nbut, so long as she has enough to eat and wear, our Christian fathers\r\nand mothers tell us it is not so bad!\r\n\r\nPoor Emily could not think so. There was no eye to pity, and none to\r\nhelp. The food of her accursed lot did not nourish her; the warmest\r\nclothing could not keep the chill of slavery from her heart. In the\r\nmiddle of the overland passage, sick, weary, heart-broken, the child\r\nlaid her down and died. By that lonely pillow there was no mother. But\r\nthere was one Friend, who loveth at all times, who is closer than a\r\nbrother. Could our eyes be touched by the seal of faith, where others\r\nsee only the lonely wilderness and the dying girl, we, perhaps, should\r\nsee one clothed in celestial beauty, waiting for that short agony to be\r\nover, that He might redeem her from all iniquity, and present her\r\nfaultless before the presence of his Grace with exceeding joy!\r\n\r\nEven the hard-hearted trader was touched with her sad fate, and we are\r\ncredibly informed that he said he was sorry he had taken her.\r\n\r\nBruin & Hill wrote to New York that the girl Emily was dead. A friend of\r\nthe family went with the letter, to break the news to her mother. Since\r\nshe had given up all hope of redeeming her daughter from the dreadful\r\ndoom to which she had been sold, the helpless mother had drooped like a\r\nstricken woman. She no longer lifted up her head, or seemed to take any\r\ninterest in life.\r\n\r\nWhen the friend called on her, she asked, eagerly,\r\n\r\n“Have you heard anything from my daughter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I have,” was the reply, “a letter from Bruin & Hill.”\r\n\r\n“And what is the news?”\r\n\r\nHe thought best to give a direct answer,—“_Emily is dead_.”\r\n\r\nThe poor mother clasped her hands, and, looking upwards, said, “The Lord\r\nbe thanked! He has heard my prayers at last!”\r\n\r\nAnd, now, will it be said this is an exceptional case—it happens one\r\ntime in a thousand? Though we know that this is the foulest of\r\nfalsehoods, and that the case is only a specimen of what is acting every\r\nday in the American slave-trade, yet, for argument’s sake, let us, for\r\nonce, admit it to be true. If only once in this nation, under the\r\nprotection of our law, a Christian girl had been torn from the altar and\r\nthe communion-table, and sold to foulest shame and dishonor, would that\r\nhave been a light sin? Does not Christ say, “Inasmuch as ye have done it\r\nunto _one of the least_ of these, ye have done it unto me”? O, words of\r\nwoe for thee, America!—words of woe for thee, church of Christ! Hast\r\nthou trod them under foot and trampled them in the dust so long that\r\nChrist has forgotten them? In the day of judgment every one of these\r\nwords shall rise up, living and burning, as accusing angels to witness\r\nagainst thee. Art thou, O church of Christ! praying daily, “Thy kingdom\r\ncome”? Darest thou pray, “Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly”? O, what if He\r\nshould come? What if the Lord, whom ye seek, should _suddenly_ come into\r\nhis temple? If his soul was stirred within him when he found within his\r\ntemple of old those that changed money, and sold sheep and oxen and\r\ndoves, what will he say now, when he finds them selling body, blood and\r\nbones, of his own people? And is the Christian church, which justifies\r\nthis enormous system,—which has used the awful name of her Redeemer to\r\nsanction the buying, selling and trading in the souls of men,—is this\r\nchurch the bride of Christ? Is she one with Christ, even as Christ is\r\none with the Father? O, bitter mockery! Does this church believe that\r\nevery Christian’s body is a temple of the Holy Ghost? Or does she think\r\nthose solemn words were idle breath, when, a thousand times, every day\r\nand week, in the midst of her, is this temple set up and sold at\r\nauction, to be bought by any godless, blasphemous man, who has money to\r\npay for it!\r\n\r\nAs to poor Daniel Bell and his family, whose contested claim to freedom\r\nwas the beginning of the whole trouble, a few members of it were\r\nredeemed, and the rest were plunged into the abyss of slavery. It would\r\nseem as if this event, like the sinking of a ship, drew into its\r\nmaëlstrom the fate of every unfortunate being who was in its vicinity. A\r\npoor, honest, hard-working slave-man, of the name of Thomas Ducket, had\r\na wife who was on board the _Pearl_. Tom was supposed to know the men\r\nwho countenanced the enterprise, and his master, therefore, determined\r\nto sell him. He brought him to Washington for the purpose. Some in\r\nWashington doubted his legal right to bring a slave from Maryland for\r\nthe purpose of selling him, and commenced legal proceedings to test the\r\nmatter. While they were pending, the counsel for the master told the men\r\nwho brought action against his client that Tom was anxious to be sold;\r\nthat he preferred being sold to the man who had purchased his wife and\r\nchildren, rather than to have his liberty. It was well known, that Tom\r\ndid not wish to be separated from his family, and the friends here,\r\nconfiding in the representations made to them, consented to withdraw the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nSome time after this, they received letters from poor Tom Ducket, dated\r\nninety miles above New Orleans, complaining sadly of his condition, and\r\nmaking piteous appeals to hear from them respecting his wife and\r\nchildren. Upon inquiry, nothing could be learned respecting them. They\r\nhad been sold and gone,—sold and gone,—no one knew whither; and as a\r\npunishment to Tom for his contumacy in refusing to give the name of the\r\nman who had projected the expedition of the _Pearl_, he was denied the\r\nprivilege of going off the place, and was not allowed to talk with the\r\nother servants, his master fearing a conspiracy. In one of his letters\r\nhe says, “I have seen more trouble here in one day than I have in all my\r\nlife.” In another, “I would be glad to hear from her [his wife], but I\r\nshould be more glad to hear of her death than for her to come here.”\r\n\r\nIn his distress, Tom wrote a letter to Mr. Bigelow, of Washington.\r\nPeople who are not in the habit of getting such documents have no idea\r\nof them. We give a _facsimile_ of Tom’s letter, with all its poor\r\nspelling, all its ignorance, helplessness, and misery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                                 [_February 18, 1852._\r\n\r\n  MR.

He who is not so is an\r\nexception, rather than a specimen. If he has anything good about him\r\nwhen he begins the business, it may well be seen that he is in a fair\r\nway to lose it.\r\n\r\nAround the trader are continually passing and repassing men and women\r\nwho would be worth to him thousands of dollars in the way of trade,—who\r\nbelong to a class whose rights nobody respects, and who, if reduced to\r\nslavery, could not easily make their word good against him. The\r\nprobability is that hundreds of free men and women and children are all\r\nthe time being precipitated into slavery in this way.\r\n\r\nThe recent case of _Northrop_, tried in Washington, D. C., throws light\r\non this fearful subject. The following account is abridged from the _New\r\nYork Times_:\r\n\r\n  Solomon Northrop is a free colored citizen of the United States; he\r\n  was born in Essex county, New York, about the year 1808; became\r\n  early a resident of Washington county, and married there in 1829.\r\n  His father and mother resided in the county of Washington about\r\n  fifty years, till their decease, and were both free. With his wife\r\n  and children he resided at Saratoga Springs in the winter of 1841,\r\n  and while there was employed by two gentlemen to drive a team South,\r\n  at the rate of a dollar a day. In fulfilment of his employment, he\r\n  proceeded to New York, and, having taken out free papers, to show\r\n  that he was a citizen, he went on to Washington city, where he\r\n  arrived the second day of April, the same year, and put up at\r\n  Gadsby’s Hotel. Soon after he arrived he felt unwell, and went to\r\n  bed.\r\n\r\n  While suffering with severe pain, some persons came in, and, seeing\r\n  the condition he was in, proposed to give him some medicine, and did\r\n  so. This is the last thing of which he had any recollection, until\r\n  he found himself chained to the floor of Williams’ slave-pen in this\r\n  city, and handcuffed. In the course of a few hours, James H. Burch,\r\n  a slave-dealer, came in, and the colored man asked him to take the\r\n  irons off from him, and wanted to know why they were put on. Burch\r\n  told him it was none of his business. The colored man said he was\r\n  free, and told where he was born. Burch called in a man by the name\r\n  of Ebenezer Rodbury, and they two stripped the man and laid him\r\n  across a bench, Rodbury holding him down by his wrists. Burch\r\n  whipped him with a paddle until he broke that, and then with a\r\n  cat-o’-nine-tails, giving him a hundred lashes; and he swore he\r\n  would kill him if he ever stated to any one that he was a free man.\r\n  From that time forward the man says he did not communicate the fact\r\n  from fear, either that he was a free man, or what his name was,\r\n  until the last summer. He was kept in the slave-pen about ten days,\r\n  when he, with others, was taken out of the pen in the night by\r\n  Burch, handcuffed and shackled, and taken down the river by a\r\n  steamboat, and then to Richmond, where he, with forty-eight others,\r\n  was put on board the brig _Orleans_. There Burch left them. Tho brig\r\n  sailed for New Orleans, and on arriving there, before she was\r\n  fastened to the wharf, Theophilus Freeman, another slave-dealer,\r\n  belonging in the city of New Orleans, and who in 1833 had been a\r\n  partner with Burch in the slavetrade, came to the wharf, and\r\n  received the slaves as they were landed, under his direction. This\r\n  man was immediately taken by Freeman and shut up in his pen in that\r\n  city, he was taken sick with the small-pox immediately after getting\r\n  there, and was sent to a hospital, where he lay two or three weeks.\r\n  When he had sufficiently recovered to leave the hospital, Freeman\r\n  declined to sell him to any person in that vicinity, and sold him to\r\n  a Mr. Ford, who resided in Rapides Parish, Louisiana, where he was\r\n  taken and lived more than a year, and worked as a carpenter, working\r\n  with Ford at that business.\r\n\r\n  Ford became involved, and had to sell him. A. Mr. Tibaut became the\r\n  purchaser. He, in a short time, sold him to Edwin Eppes, in Bayou\r\n  Beouf, about one hundred and thirty miles from the mouth of Red\r\n  river, where Eppes has retained him on a cotton plantation since the\r\n  year 1843.\r\n\r\n  To go back a step in the narrative, the man wrote a letter, in June,\r\n  1841, to Henry B. Northrop, of the State of New York, dated and\r\n  postmarked at New Orleans, stating that he had been kidnapped and\r\n  was on board a vessel, but was unable to state what his destination\r\n  was; but requesting Mr. N. to aid him in recovering his freedom, if\r\n  possible. Mr. N. was unable to do anything in his behalf, in\r\n  consequence of not knowing where he had gone, and not being able to\r\n  find any trace of him. His place of residence remained unknown until\r\n  the month of September last, when the following letter was received\r\n  by his friends:\r\n\r\n                                          _Bayou Beouf, August, 1852._\r\n\r\n  MR. WILLIAM PENY, or MR. LEWIS PARKER.\r\n\r\n  GENTLEMEN: It having been a long time since I have seen or heard\r\n  from you, and not knowing that you are living, it is with\r\n  uncertainty that I write to you; but the necessity of the case must\r\n  be my excuse. Having been born free just across the river from you,\r\n  I am certain you know me; and I am here now a slave. I wish you to\r\n  obtain free papers for me, and forward them to me at Marksville,\r\n  Louisiana, Parish of Avovelles, and oblige\r\n\r\n                                 Yours,\r\n\r\n                                                     SOLOMON NORTHROP.\r\n\r\n  On receiving the above letter, Mr. N. applied to Governor Hunt, of\r\n  New York, for such authority as was necessary for him to proceed to\r\n  Louisiana as an agent to procure the liberation of Solomon. Proof of\r\n  his freedom was furnished to Governor Hunt by affidavits of several\r\n  gentlemen, General Clarke among others. Accordingly, in pursuance of\r\n  the laws of New York, Henry B. Northrop was constituted an agent, to\r\n  take such steps, by procuring evidence, retaining counsel, &c., as\r\n  were necessary to secure the freedom of Solomon, and to execute all\r\n  the duties of his agency.\r\n\r\nThe result of Mr. Northrop’s agency was the establishing of the claim of\r\nSolomon Northrop to freedom, and the restoring him to his native land.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular coincidence that this man was carried to a plantation\r\nin the Red river country, that same region where the scene of Tom’s\r\ncaptivity was laid; and his account of this plantation, his mode of life\r\nthere, and some incidents which he describes, form a striking parallel\r\nto that history. We extract them from the article of the _Times_:\r\n\r\n  The condition of this colored man during the nine years that he was\r\n  in the hands of Eppes was of a character nearly approaching that\r\n  described by Mrs. Stowe as the condition of “Uncle Tom” while in\r\n  that region. During that whole period his hut contained neither a\r\n  floor, nor a chair, nor a bed, nor a mattress, nor anything for him\r\n  to lie upon, except a board about twelve inches wide, with a block\r\n  of wood for his pillow, and with a single blanket to cover him,\r\n  while the walls of his hut did not by any means protect him from the\r\n  inclemency of the weather. He was sometimes compelled to perform\r\n  acts revolting to humanity, and outrageous in the highest degree. On\r\n  one occasion, a colored girl belonging to Eppes, about seventeen\r\n  years of age, went one Sunday, without the permission of her master,\r\n  to the nearest plantation, about half a mile distant, to visit\r\n  another colored girl of her acquaintance. She returned in the course\r\n  of two or three hours, and for that offence she was called up for\r\n  punishment, which Solomon was required to inflict. Eppes compelled\r\n  him to drive four stakes into the ground at such distances that the\r\n  hands and ankles of the girl might be tied to them, as she lay with\r\n  her face upon the ground; and, having thus fastened her down, he\r\n  compelled him, while standing by himself, to inflict one hundred\r\n  lashes upon her bare flesh, she being stripped naked. Having\r\n  inflicted the hundred blows, Solomon refused to proceed any further.\r\n  Eppes tried to compel him to go on, but he absolutely set him at\r\n  defiance, and refused to murder the girl. Eppes then seized the\r\n  whip, and applied it until he was too weary to continue it. Blood\r\n  flowed from her neck to her feet, and in this condition she was\r\n  compelled the next day to go into the field to work as a field-hand.\r\n  She bears the marks still upon her body although the punishment was\r\n  inflicted four years ago.\r\n\r\n  When Solomon was about to leave, under the care of Mr. Northrop,\r\n  this girl came from behind her hut, unseen by her master, and,\r\n  throwing her arms around the neck of Solomon, congratulated him on\r\n  his escape from slavery, and his return to his family; at the same\r\n  time, in language of despair, exclaiming, “But, O God! what will\r\n  become of me?”\r\n\r\n  These statements regarding the condition of Solomon while with\r\n  Eppes, and the punishment and brutal treatment of the colored girls,\r\n  are taken from Solomon himself. It has been stated that the nearest\r\n  plantation was distant from that of Eppes a half-mile, and of course\r\n  there could be no interference on the part of neighbors in any\r\n  punishment, however cruel, or how ever well disposed to interfere\r\n  they might be.\r\n\r\nHad not Northrop been able to write, as few of the free blacks in the\r\nslave states are, his doom might have been sealed for life in this den\r\nof misery.\r\n\r\nTwo cases recently tried in Baltimore also unfold facts of a similar\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe following is from\r\n\r\n              THE CASE OF RACHEL PARKER AND HER SISTER....\r\n\r\n  It will be remembered that more than a year since a young colored\r\n  woman, named Mary Elizabeth Parker, was abducted from Chester county\r\n  and conveyed to Baltimore, where she was sold as a slave, and\r\n  transported to New Orleans. A few days after, her sister, Rachel\r\n  Parker, was also abducted in like manner, taken to Baltimore, and\r\n  detained there in consequence of the interference of her Chester\r\n  county friends. In the first case, Mary Elizabeth was, by an\r\n  arrangement with the individual who had her in charge, brought back\r\n  to Baltimore, to await her trial on a petition for freedom. So also\r\n  with regard to Rachel. Both, after trial,—the proof in their favor\r\n  being so overwhelming,—were discharged, and are now among their\r\n  friends in Chester county. In this connection we give the narratives\r\n  of both females, obtained since their release.\r\n\r\n                      _Rachel Parker’s Narrative._\r\n\r\n  “I was taken from Joseph C. Miller’s about twelve o’clock on Tuesday\r\n  (Dec. 30th, 1851), by two men who came up to the house by the _back_\r\n  door. One came in and asked Mrs. Miller where Jesse McCreary lived,\r\n  and then seized me by the arm, and pulled me out of the house. Mrs.\r\n  Miller called to her husband, who was in the _front_ porch, and he\r\n  ran out and seized the man by the collar, and tried to stop him. The\r\n  other, with an oath, then told him to take his hands off, and if he\r\n  touched me he would kill him. He then told Miller that I belonged to\r\n  Mr. Schoolfield, in Baltimore. They then hurried me to a wagon,\r\n  where there was another large man, put me in, and drove off.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Miller ran across the field to head the wagon, and picked up a\r\n  stake to run through the wheel, when one of the men pulled out a\r\n  sword (I think it was a sword, I never saw one), and threatened to\r\n  cut Miller’s arm off. Pollock’s wagon being in the way, and he\r\n  refusing to get out of the road, we turned off to the left. After we\r\n  rode away, one of the men tore a hole in the back of the carriage,\r\n  to look out to see if they were coming after us, and they said they\r\n  wished they had given Miller and Pollock a blow.\r\n\r\n  “We stopped at a tavern near the railroad, and I told the landlord\r\n  (I think it was) that I was free. I also told several persons at the\r\n  car-office; and a very nice-looking man at the car-office was\r\n  talking at the door, and he said he thought that they had better\r\n  take me back again. One of the men did not come further than the\r\n  tavern. I was taken to Baltimore, where we arrived about seven\r\n  o’clock the same evening, and I was taken to jail.\r\n\r\n  “The next morning, a man with large light-colored whiskers took me\r\n  away by myself, and asked me if I was not Mr. Schoolfield’s slave. I\r\n  told him I was not; he said that I was, and that if I did not say I\r\n  was he would ‘cowhide me and salt me, and put me in a dungeon.’ I\r\n  told him I was free, and that I would say nothing but the truth.”\r\n\r\n                     _Mary E. Parker’s Narrative._\r\n\r\n  “I was taken from Matthew Donnelly’s on Saturday night (Dec. 6th, or\r\n  13th, 1851); was caught whilst out of doors, soon after I had\r\n  cleared the supper-table, about seven o’clock, by two men, and put\r\n  into a wagon. One of them got into the wagon with me, and rode to\r\n  Elkton, Md., where I was kept until Sunday night at twelve o’clock,\r\n  when I left there in the cars for Baltimore, and arrived there early\r\n  on Monday morning.\r\n\r\n  “At Elkton a man was brought in to see me, by one of the men, who\r\n  said that I was not his father’s slave. Afterwards, when on the way\r\n  to Baltimore in the cars, a man told me that I must say that I was\r\n  Mr. Schoolfield’s slave, or he would shoot me, and pulled a ‘rifle’\r\n  out of his pocket and showed it to me, and also threatened to whip\r\n  me.\r\n\r\n  “On Monday morning, Mr. Schoolfield called at the jail in Baltimore\r\n  to see me; and on Tuesday morning he brought his wife and several\r\n  other ladies to see me. I told them I did not know them, and then\r\n  Mr. C. took me out of the room, and told me who they were, and took\r\n  me back again, so that I might appear to know them. On the next\r\n  Monday I was shipped to New Orleans.\r\n\r\n  “It took about a month to get to New Orleans. After I had been there\r\n  about a week, Mr. C. sold me to Madame C., who keeps a large\r\n  flower-garden. She sends flowers to sell to the theatres, sells milk\r\n  in market, &c. I went out to sell candy and flowers for her, when I\r\n  lived with her. One evening, when I was coming home from the\r\n  theatre, a watchman took me up, and I told him I was not a slave. He\r\n  put me in the calaboose, and next morning took me before a\r\n  magistrate, who sent for Madame C., who told him she bought me. He\r\n  then sent for Mr. C., and told him he must account for how he got\r\n  me. Mr. C. said that my mother and all the family were free, except\r\n  me. The magistrate told me to go back to Madame C., and he told\r\n  Madame C. that she must not let me go out at night; and he told Mr.\r\n  C. that he must prove how he came by me. The magistrate afterwards\r\n  called on Mrs. C., at her house, and had a long talk with her in the\r\n  parlor. I do not know what he said, as they were by themselves.\r\n  About a month afterwards, I was sent back to Baltimore. I lived with\r\n  Madame C. about six months.\r\n\r\n  “There were six slaves came in the vessel with me to Baltimore, who\r\n  belonged to Mr. D., and were returned because they were sickly.\r\n\r\n  “A man called to see me at the jail after I came back to Baltimore,\r\n  and told me that I must say I was Mr. Schoolfield’s slave, and that\r\n  if I did not do it he would kill me the first time he got a chance.\r\n  He said Rachel [her sister] said she came from Baltimore and was Mr.\r\n  Schoolfield’s slave. Afterwards some gentlemen called on me [Judge\r\n  Campbell and Judge Bell, of Philadelphia, and William H. Norris,\r\n  Esq., of Baltimore], and I told them I was Mr. Schoolfield’s slave.\r\n  They said they were my friends, and I must tell them the truth. I\r\n  then told them who I was and all about it.\r\n\r\n  “When I was in New Orleans Mr. C. whipped me because I said that I\r\n  was free.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Elizabeth, by her own account above, was seized and taken from\r\n  Pennsylvania, Dec. 6th or 13th, 1851, which is confirmed by other\r\n  testimony.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded that such cases, when brought into Southern courts, are\r\ngenerally tried with great fairness and impartiality. The agent for\r\nNorthrop’s release testifies to this, and it has been generally admitted\r\nfact. But it is probably only one case in a hundred that can get into\r\ncourt:—of the multitudes who are drawn down in the ever-widening\r\nmaëlstrom only now and then one ever comes back to tell the tale.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding chapter of advertisements will show the reader how many\r\nsuch victims there may probably be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n              SLAVES AS THEY ARE, ON TESTIMONY OF OWNERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigation into the actual condition of the slave population at\r\nthe South is beset with many difficulties. So many things are said _pro_\r\nand _con_,—so many said in one connection and denied in another,—that\r\nthe effect is very confusing.\r\n\r\nThus, we are told that the state of the slaves is one of blissful\r\ncontentment; that they would not take freedom as a gift; that their\r\nfamily relations are only now and then invaded; that they are a stupid\r\nrace, almost sunk to the condition of animals; that generally they are\r\nkindly treated, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nIn reading over some two hundred Southern newspapers this fall, the\r\nauthor has been struck with the very graphic and circumstantial\r\npictures, which occur in all of them, describing fugitive slaves. From\r\nthese descriptions one may learn a vast many things. The author will\r\nhere give an assortment of them, taken at random. It is a commentary on\r\nthe contented state of the slave population that the writer finds two or\r\nthree always, and often many more, in every one of the hundreds of\r\nSouthern papers examined.\r\n\r\nIn reading the following little sketches of “slaves as they are,” let\r\nthe reader notice:\r\n\r\n1. The color and complexion of the majority of them.\r\n\r\n2. That it is customary either to describe slaves by some _scar_, or to\r\nsay “_No scars recollected_.”\r\n\r\n3. The _intelligence_ of the parties advertised.\r\n\r\n4. The number that _say they are free_ that are to be _sold to pay\r\njail-fees_.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these slaves has a history,—a history of woe and crime,\r\ndegradation, endurance, and wrong.

Such a rarity ought to be choice!\r\n\r\n_Savannah Daily Georgian_, 6th Sept., 1852:\r\n\r\n                               ARRESTED.\r\n\r\n  ABOUT three weeks ago, under suspicious circumstances, a negro\r\n  woman, who calls herself PHEBE, or PHILLIS. _Says she is free_, and\r\n  lately from Beaufort District, South Carolina. Said woman is about\r\n  50 years of age, stout in stature, mild-spoken, 5 feet 4 inches\r\n  high, and weighs about 140 pounds. Having made diligent inquiry by\r\n  letter, and from what I can learn, said woman is a runaway. Any\r\n  person owning said slave can get her by making application to me,\r\n  properly authenticated.\r\n\r\n                                                   WARING RUSSELL,\r\n                                                     County Constable.\r\n\r\n  Savannah, Oct. 25, 1852.      6      Oct. 26.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                          250 DOLLARS REWARD.\r\n\r\n  RANAWAY from Sparta, Ga., about the first of last year my boy\r\n  GEORGE. He is a good carpenter, about 35 years; a bright mulatto,\r\n  tall and quite likely. _He was brought about three years ago from\r\n  St. Mary’s, and had, when he ran away, a wife there, or near there,\r\n  belonging to a Mr. Holzendorff._ I think he has told me he has been\r\n  about Macon also. He had, and perhaps still has, a brother in\r\n  Savannah. _He is very intelligent._ I will give the above reward for\r\n  his confinement in some jail in the State, so that I can get him.\r\n  Refer, for any further information, to Rabun & Whitehead, Savannah,\r\n  Ga.\r\n\r\n                                                       W.

That the arguments for the enslaving of the _negro_ do not apply to a\r\nlarge part of the actual slaves.\r\n\r\n2. That they are not, in the estimation of their masters, very stupid.\r\n\r\n3. That they are not remarkably contented.\r\n\r\n4. That they have no particular reason to be so.\r\n\r\n5. That multitudes of men claiming to be free are constantly being sold\r\ninto slavery.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the complexion of these slaves, there are some points\r\nworthy of consideration. The writer adds the following advertisements,\r\npublished by Wm. I. Bowditch, Esq., in his pamphlet “Slavery and the\r\nConstitution.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Richmond_ (Va.) _Whig_:\r\n\r\n                           100 DOLLARS REWARD\r\n\r\n  WILL be given for the apprehension of my negro (!) Edmund Kenney.\r\n  _He has straight hair, and complexion so nearly white that it is\r\n  believed a stranger would suppose there was no African blood in\r\n  him._ He was with my boy Dick a short time since in Norfolk, _and\r\n  offered him for sale_, and was apprehended, _but escaped under\r\n  pretence of being a white man_!\r\n\r\n                                                      ANDERSON BOWLES.\r\n\r\n  January 6, 1836.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Republican Banner and Nashville Whig_ of July 14, 1849:\r\n\r\n                          200 DOLLARS REWARD.\r\n\r\n  RANAWAY from the subscriber, on the 23d of June last, a bright\r\n  mulatto woman, named Julia, about 25 years of age. She is of common\r\n  size, _nearly white_, and very likely. She is a good seamstress, and\r\n  can read a little. _She may attempt to pass for white_,—dresses\r\n  fine. She took with her Anna, her child, 8 or 9 years old, and\r\n  considerably darker than her mother.... She once belonged to a Mr.\r\n  Helm, of Columbia, Tennessee.\r\n\r\n  I will give a reward of $50 for said negro and child, if delivered\r\n  to me, or confined in any jail in this state, so I can get them;\r\n  $100, if caught in any other Slave state, and confined in a jail so\r\n  that I can get them; and $200, if caught in any Free state, and put\r\n  in any good jail in Kentucky or Tennessee, so I can get them.\r\n\r\n                                                        A.

Said woman\r\n  is 20 years old; is rather tall; can read and write, and so forge\r\n  passes for herself. Carried away with her a pair of ear-rings,—a\r\n  Bible with a red cover; is very pious. She prays a great deal, and\r\n  was, as supposed, contented and happy. _She is as white as most\r\n  white women, with straight, light hair, and blue eyes, and can pass\r\n  herself for a white woman._ I will give $500 for her apprehension\r\n  and delivery to me. She is very intelligent.\r\n\r\n  Tuscaloosa, May 29, 1845.\r\n\r\n                                                           JOHN BALCH.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Newbern_ (N.

William is about 19 years old, _quite\r\n  white, and would not readily be taken for a slave_.\r\n\r\n                                                         JOHN J. LANE.\r\n\r\n  March 13, 1837.\r\n\r\nThe next two advertisements we cut from the _New Orleans Picayune_ of\r\nSept. 2, 1846:\r\n\r\n                           25 DOLLARS REWARD.\r\n\r\n  Ranaway from the plantation of Madame Fergus Duplantier, on or about\r\n  the 27th of June, 1846, a bright mulatto, named Ned, very stout\r\n  built, about 5 feet 11 inches high, _speaks English and French_,\r\n  about 35 years old, waddles in his walk. _He may try to pass himself\r\n  for a white man, as he is of a very clear color, and has sandy\r\n  hair._ The above reward will be paid to whoever will bring him to\r\n  Madame Duplantier’s plantation, Manchac, or lodge him in some jail\r\n  where he can be conveniently obtained.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                          200 DOLLARS REWARD.\r\n\r\n  Ran away from the subscriber, last November, _a white negro_ man,\r\n  about 35 years old, height about 5 feet 8 or 10 inches, _blue eyes,\r\n  has a yellow woolly head, very fair skin_.\r\n\r\nThese are the characteristics of three races. The copper-colored\r\ncomplexion shows the Indian blood. The others are the mixed races of\r\nnegroes and whites. It is known that the poor remains of Indian races\r\nhave been in many cases forced into slavery. It is no less certain that\r\nwhite children have sometimes been kidnapped and sold into slavery. Rev.\r\nGeorge Bourne, of Virginia, Presbyterian minister, who wrote against\r\nslavery there as early as 1816, gives an account of a boy who was stolen\r\nfrom his parents at seven years of age, immersed in a tan-vat to change\r\nhis complexion, tattooed and sold, and, after a captivity of fourteen\r\nyears, succeeded in escaping. The tanning process is not necessary now,\r\nas a fair skin is no presumption against slavery. There is reason to\r\nthink that the grandmother of poor Emily Russell was a _white child_,\r\nstolen by kidnappers. That kidnappers may steal and sell white children\r\nat the South now, is evident from these advertisements.\r\n\r\nThe writer, within a week, has seen a fugitive quadroon mother, who had\r\nwith her two children,—a boy of ten months, and a girl of three years.\r\nBoth were surpassingly fair, and uncommonly beautiful. The girl had blue\r\neyes and golden hair. The mother and those children were about to be\r\nsold for the division of an estate, which was the reason why she fled.\r\nWhen the mind once becomes familiarized with the process of slavery,—of\r\nenslaving first black, then Indian, then mulatto, then quadroon, and\r\nwhen blue eyes and golden hair are advertised as properties of\r\n_negroes_,—what protection will there be for poor white people,\r\nespecially as under the present fugitive law they can be carried away\r\nwithout a jury trial?\r\n\r\nA Governor of South Carolina openly declared, in 1835, that the laboring\r\npopulation of any country, bleached or unbleached, were a _dangerous\r\nelement_, unless reduced to slavery. Will not this be the result, then?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n                          “POOR WHITE TRASH.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the public sentiment of Europe speaks in tones of indignation of\r\nthe system of American slavery, the common reply has been, “_Look at\r\nyour own lower classes_.” The apologists of slavery have pointed England\r\nto _her own poor_. They have spoken of the heathenish ignorance, the\r\nvice, the darkness, of her crowded cities,—nay, even of her agricultural\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nNow, in the first place, a country where the population is not crowded,\r\nwhere the resources of the soil are more than sufficient for the\r\ninhabitants,—a country of recent origin, not burdened with the worn-out\r\ninstitutions and clumsy lumber of past ages,—ought not to be satisfied\r\nto do _only_ as well as countries which have to struggle against all\r\nthese evils.\r\n\r\nIt is a poor defence for America to say to older countries, “We are no\r\nworse than you are.” She ought to be infinitely better.\r\n\r\nBut it will appear that the institution of slavery has produced not only\r\nheathenish, degraded, miserable slaves, but it produces a class of white\r\npeople who are, by universal admission, more heathenish, degraded, and\r\nmiserable. The institution of slavery has accomplished the double feat,\r\nin America, not only of degrading and brutalizing her black working\r\nclasses, but of producing, notwithstanding a fertile soil and abundant\r\nroom, a poor white population as degraded and brutal as ever existed in\r\nany of the most crowded districts of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe way that it is done can be made apparent in a few words. 1. The\r\ndistribution of the land into large plantations, and the consequent\r\nsparseness of settlement, make any system of common-school education\r\nimpracticable. 2. The same cause operates with regard to the preaching\r\nof the gospel. 3. The degradation of the idea of labor, which results\r\ninevitably from enslaving the working class, operates to a great extent\r\nin preventing respectable working men of the middling classes from\r\nsettling or remaining in slave states. Where carpenters, blacksmiths and\r\nmasons, are advertised every week with their own tools, or in company\r\nwith horses, hogs and other cattle, there is necessarily such an\r\nestimate of the laboring class that intelligent, self-respecting\r\nmechanics, such as abound in the free states, must find much that is\r\nannoying and disagreeable. They may endure it for a time, but with much\r\nuneasiness; and they are glad of the first opportunity of emigration.\r\n\r\nThen, again, the filling up of all branches of mechanics and agriculture\r\nwith slave labor necessarily depresses free labor. Suppose, now, a\r\nfamily of poor whites in Carolina or Virginia, and the same family in\r\nVermont or Maine; how different the influences that come over them! In\r\nVermont or Maine, the children have the means of education at hand in\r\npublic schools, and they have all around them in society avenues of\r\nsuccess that require only industry to make them available. The boys have\r\ntheir choice among all the different trades, for which the organization\r\nof free society makes a steady demand. The girls, animated by the spirit\r\nof the land in which they are born, think useful labor no disgrace, and\r\nfind, with true female ingenuity, a hundred ways of adding to the family\r\nstock. If there be one member of a family in whom diviner gifts and\r\nhigher longings seem a call for a more finished course of education,\r\nthen cheerfully the whole family unites its productive industry to give\r\nthat one the wider education which his wider genius demands; and thus\r\nhave been given to the world such men as Roger Sherman and Daniel\r\nWebster.\r\n\r\nBut take this same family and plant them in South Carolina or\r\nVirginia—how different the result! No common school opens its doors to\r\ntheir children; the only church, perhaps, is fifteen miles off, over a\r\nbad road. The whole atmosphere of the country in which they are born\r\nassociates degradation and slavery with useful labor; and the only\r\nstandard of gentility is ability to live without work. What branch of\r\nuseful labor opens a way to its sons? Would he be a blacksmith?—The\r\nplanters around him prefer to _buy_ their blacksmiths in Virginia. Would\r\nhe be a carpenter?—Each planter in his neighborhood owns one or two now.\r\nAnd so coopers and masons. Would he be a shoe-maker?—The plantation\r\nshoes are made in Lynn and Natick, towns of New England. In fact,\r\nbetween the free labor of the North and the slave labor of the South,\r\nthere is nothing for a poor white to do. Without schools or churches,\r\nthese miserable families grow up heathen on a Christian soil, in\r\nidleness, vice, dirt and discomfort of all sorts. They are the pest of\r\nthe neighborhood, the scoff and contempt or pity even of the slaves. The\r\nexpressive phrase, so common in the mouths of the negroes, of “poor\r\nwhite trash,” says all for this luckless race of beings that can be\r\nsaid. From this class spring a tribe of keepers of small groggeries, and\r\ndealers, by a kind of contraband trade, with the negroes, in the stolen\r\nproduce of plantations. Thriving and promising sons may perhaps hope to\r\ngrow up into negro-traders, and thence be exalted into overseers of\r\nplantations. The utmost stretch of ambition is to compass money enough,\r\nby any of a variety of nondescript measures, to “buy a _nigger_ or two,”\r\nand begin to appear like other folks. Woe betide the unfortunate negro\r\nman or woman, carefully raised in some good religious family, when an\r\nexecution or the death of their proprietors throws them into the market,\r\nand they are bought by a master and mistress of this class! Oftentimes\r\nthe slave is infinitely the superior, in every respect,—in person,\r\nmanners, education and morals; but, for all that, the law guards the\r\ndespotic authority of the owner quite as jealously.\r\n\r\nFrom all that would appear, in the case of Souther, which we have\r\nrecorded, he must have been one of this class. We have certain\r\nindications, in the evidence, that the two white witnesses, who spent\r\nthe whole day in gaping, unresisting survey of his diabolical\r\nproceedings, were men of this order. It appears that the crime alleged\r\nagainst the poor victim was that of getting drunk and trading with these\r\ntwo very men, and that they were sent for probably by way of showing\r\nthem “what a nigger would get by trading with them.” This circumstance\r\nat once marks them out as belonging to that band of half-contraband\r\ntraders who spring up among the mean whites, and occasion owners of\r\nslaves so much inconvenience by dealing with their hands. Can any words\r\nso forcibly show what sort of white men these are, as the idea of their\r\nstanding in stupid, brutal curiosity, a whole day, as _witnesses_ in\r\nsuch a hellish scene?\r\n\r\nConceive the misery of the slave who falls into the hands of such\r\nmasters! A clergyman, now dead, communicated to the writer the following\r\nanecdote: In travelling in one of the Southern States, he put up for the\r\nnight in a miserable log shanty, kept by a man of this class. All was\r\ndirt, discomfort and utter barbarism. The man, his wife, and their stock\r\nof wild, neglected children, drank whiskey, loafed and predominated over\r\nthe miserable man and woman who did all the work and bore all the\r\ncaprices of the whole establishment. He—the gentleman—was not long in\r\ndiscovering that these slaves were in person, language, and in every\r\nrespect, superior to their owners; and all that he could get of comfort\r\nin this miserable abode was owing to their ministrations. Before he went\r\naway, they contrived to have a private interview, and begged him to buy\r\nthem. They told him that they had been decently brought up in a\r\nrespectable and refined family, and that their bondage was therefore the\r\nmore inexpressibly galling. The poor creatures had waited on him with\r\nmost assiduous care, tending his horse, brushing his boots, and\r\nanticipating all his wants, in the hope of inducing him to buy them. The\r\nclergyman said that he never so wished for money as when he saw the\r\ndejected visages with which they listened to his assurances that he was\r\ntoo poor to comply with their desires.\r\n\r\nThis miserable class of whites form, in all the Southern States, a\r\nmaterial for the most horrible and ferocious of mobs. Utterly ignorant,\r\nand inconceivably brutal, they are like some blind, savage monster,\r\nwhich, when aroused, tramples heedlessly over everything in its way.\r\n\r\nSingular as it may appear, though slavery is the cause of the misery and\r\ndegradation of this class, yet they are the most vehement and ferocious\r\nadvocates of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe reason is this. They feel the scorn of the upper classes, and their\r\nonly means of consolation is in having a class below them, whom they may\r\nscorn in turn. To set the negro at liberty would deprive them of this\r\nlast comfort; and accordingly no class of men advocate slavery with such\r\nfrantic and unreasoning violence, or hate abolitionists with such\r\ndemoniac hatred. Let the reader conceive of a mob of men as brutal and\r\ncallous as the two white witnesses of the Souther tragedy, led on by men\r\nlike Souther himself, and he will have some idea of the materials which\r\noccur in the worst kind of Southern mobs.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the community, those men who play on other men with as\r\nlittle care for them as a harper plays on a harp, keep this blind,\r\nfurious monster of the MOB, very much as an overseer keeps\r\nplantation-dogs, as creatures to be set on to any man or thing whom they\r\nmay choose to have put down.\r\n\r\nThese leading men have used the cry of “_abolitionism_” over the mob,\r\nmuch as a huntsman uses the “set on” to his dogs. Whenever they have a\r\npurpose to carry, a man to put down, they have only to raise this cry,\r\nand the monster is wide awake, ready to spring wherever they shall send\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nDoes a minister raise his voice in favor of the slave?—Immediately, with\r\na whoop and hurra, some editor starts the mob on him, as an\r\nabolitionist. Is there a man teaching his negroes to read?—The mob is\r\nstarted upon him—he must promise to give it up, or leave the state. Does\r\na man at a public hotel-table express his approbation of some\r\nanti-slavery work?—Up come the police, and arrest him for seditious\r\nlanguage;[23] and on the heels of the police, thronging round the\r\njustice’s office, come the ever-ready mob,—men with clubs and\r\nbowie-knives, swearing that they will have his heart’s blood. The more\r\nrespectable citizens in vain try to compose them; it is quite as hopeful\r\nto reason with a pack of hounds, and the only way is to smuggle the\r\nsuspected person out of the state as quickly as possible. All these are\r\nscenes of common occurrence at the South. Every Southern man knows them\r\nto be so, and they know, too, the reason _why_ they are so; but, so much\r\ndo they fear the monster, that they dare not say what they know.\r\n\r\nThis brute monster sometimes gets beyond the power of his masters, and\r\nthen results ensue most mortifying to the patriotism of honorable\r\nSouthern men, but which they are powerless to prevent. Such was the case\r\nwhen the Honorable Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, with his daughter,\r\nvisited the city of Charleston. The senator was appointed by the\r\nsovereign State of Massachusetts to inquire into the condition of her\r\nfree colored citizens detained in South Carolina prisons. We cannot\r\nsuppose that men of honor and education, in South Carolina, can\r\ncontemplate without chagrin the fact that this honorable gentleman, the\r\nrepresentative of a sister state, and accompanied by his daughter, was\r\nobliged to flee from South Carolina, because they were told that the\r\nconstituted authorities would not be powerful enough to protect them\r\nfrom the ferocities of a mob. This is not the only case in which this\r\nmob power has escaped from the hands of its guiders and produced\r\nmortifying results. The scenes of Vicksburg, and the succession of\r\npopular whirlwinds which at that time flew over the south-western\r\nstates, have been forcibly painted by the author of “The White Slave.”\r\n\r\nThey who find these popular outbreaks useful when they serve their own\r\nturns are sometimes forcibly reminded of the consequences\r\n\r\n                “Of letting rapine loose, and murder,\r\n                To go _just so far_, and no further;\r\n                And setting all the land on fire,\r\n                To burn _just so high_, and no higher.”\r\n\r\nThe statements made above can be substantiated by various\r\ndocuments,—mostly by the testimony of residents in slave states and by\r\nextracts from their newspapers.\r\n\r\nConcerning the class of poor whites, Mr. William Gregg, of Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina, in a pamphlet, called “Essays On Domestic Industry, or\r\nan Inquiry into the expediency of establishing Cotton Manufactories in\r\nSouth Carolina, 1845,” says, p. 22:\r\n\r\n  “Shall we pass unnoticed the thousands of poor, ignorant, degraded\r\n  white people among us, who, in this land of plenty, live in\r\n  comparative nakedness and starvation? Many a one is reared in\r\n  _proud_ South Carolina, from birth to manhood, who has never passed\r\n  a month in which he has not, some part of the time, been stinted for\r\n  meat. Many a mother is there who will tell you that her children are\r\n  but scantily provided with bread, and much more scantily with meat;\r\n  and, if they be clad with comfortable raiment, it is at the expense\r\n  of these scanty allowances of food. These may be startling\r\n  statements, but they are nevertheless true; and if not believed in\r\n  Charleston, the members of our legislature who have traversed the\r\n  state in electioneering campaigns can attest their truth.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Henry Duffner, D.D., President of Lexington College, Va.,\r\nhimself a slave-holder, published in 1847 an address to the people of\r\nVirginia, showing that slavery is injurious to public welfare, in which\r\nhe shows the influence of slavery in producing a decrease of the white\r\npopulation. He says:\r\n\r\n  It appears that, in the ten years from 1830 to 1840, Virginia lost\r\n  by emigration no fewer than three hundred and seventy-five thousand\r\n  of her people; of whom East Virginia lost three hundred and four\r\n  thousand, and West Virginia seventy-one thousand. At this rate,\r\n  Virginia supplies the West, every ten years, with a population equal\r\n  in number to the population of the State of Mississippi in 1840.\r\n  * * * * * She has sent—or, we should rather say, she has driven—from\r\n  her soil at least one-third of all the emigrants who have gone from\r\n  the old states to the new. More than another third have gone from\r\n  the other old slave states. Many of these multitudes, who have left\r\n  the slave states, have shunned the regions of slavery, and settled\r\n  in the free countries of the West. These were generally industrious\r\n  and enterprising white men, who found, by sad experience, that a\r\n  country of slaves was not the country for them. It is a truth, a\r\n  certain truth, _that slavery drives free laborers—farmers, mechanics\r\n  and all, and some of the best of them, too—out of the country, and\r\n  fills their places with negroes_. * * * * * Even the common\r\n  mechanical trades do not flourish in a slave state. Some mechanical\r\n  operations must, indeed, be performed in every civilised country;\r\n  but the general rule in the South is, to import from abroad every\r\n  fabricated thing that can be carried in ships, such as household\r\n  furniture, boats, boards, laths, carts, ploughs, axes, and\r\n  axe-helves; besides innumerable other things, which free communities\r\n  are accustomed to make for themselves. What is most wonderful is,\r\n  that the forests and iron mines of the South supply, in great part,\r\n  the materials out of which these things are made. The Northern\r\n  freemen come with their ships, carry home the timber and pig-iron,\r\n  work them up, supply their own wants with a part, and then sell the\r\n  rest at a good profit in the Southern markets. Now, although\r\n  mechanics, by setting, up their shops in the South, could save all\r\n  these freights and profits, yet so it is that Northern mechanics\r\n  will not settle in the South, and the Southern mechanics are\r\n  undersold by their Northern competitors.\r\n\r\nIn regard to education, Rev. Theodore Parker gives the following\r\nstatistics, in his “Letters on Slavery,” p. 65:\r\n\r\n  In 1671, Sir William Berkely, Governor of Virginia, said, “I thank\r\n  God that there are no free schools nor printing-presses (in\r\n  Virginia), and I hope we shall not have them these hundred years.”\r\n  In 1840, in the fifteen slave states and territories, there were at\r\n  the various primary schools 201,085 scholars; at the various primary\r\n  schools of the free states, 1,626,028. The State of Ohio alone had,\r\n  at her primary schools, 17,524 more scholars than all the fifteen\r\n  slave states. New York alone had 301,282 more.\r\n\r\n  In the slave states there are 1,368,325 free white children between\r\n  the ages of five and twenty; in the free states, 3,536,689 such\r\n  children. In the slave states, at schools and colleges, there are\r\n  301,172 pupils; in the free states, 2,212,444 pupils at schools or\r\n  colleges. Thus, in the slave states, out of twenty-five free white\r\n  children between five and twenty, there are not quite five at any\r\n  school or college; while out of twenty-five such children in the\r\n  free states, there are more than fifteen at school or college.\r\n\r\n  In the slave states, of the free white population that is over\r\n  twenty years of age, there is almost one-tenth part that are unable\r\n  to read and write; while in the free states there is not quite one\r\n  in one hundred and fifty-six who is deficient to that degree.\r\n\r\n  In New England there are but few born therein, and more than twenty\r\n  years of age, who are unable to read and write; but many foreigners\r\n  arrive there with no education, and thus swell the number of the\r\n  illiterate, and diminish the apparent effect of her free\r\n  institutions. The South has few such emigrants; the ignorance of the\r\n  Southern States, therefore, is to be ascribed to other causes. The\r\n  Northern men who settle in the slave-holding states have perhaps\r\n  about the average culture of the North, and more than that of the\r\n  South. The South, therefore, gains educationally from immigration,\r\n  as the North loses.\r\n\r\n  Among the Northern States Connecticut, and among the Southern States\r\n  South Carolina, are to a great degree free from disturbing\r\n  influences of this character. A comparison between the two will show\r\n  the relative effects of the respective institutions of the North and\r\n  South. In Connecticut there are 163,843 free persons over twenty\r\n  years of age; in South Carolina, but 111,663. In Connecticut there\r\n  are but 526 persons over twenty who are unable to read and write,\r\n  while in South Carolina there are 20,615 free white persons over\r\n  twenty years of age unable to read and write. In South Carolina, out\r\n  of each 626 free whites more than twenty years of age there are more\r\n  than 58 wholly unable to read or write; out of that number of such\r\n  persons in Connecticut, not quite two! More than the sixth part of\r\n  the adult freemen of South Carolina are unable to read the vote\r\n  which will be deposited at the next election. It is but fair to\r\n  infer that at least one-third of the adults of South Carolina, if\r\n  not of much of the South are unable to read and understand even a\r\n  newspaper. Indeed, in one of the slave states this is not a matter\r\n  of mere inference; for in 1837 Gov. Clarke, of Kentucky, declared in\r\n  his message to the legislature that “one-third of the adult\r\n  population were unable to write their names;” yet Kentucky has a\r\n  “school-fund,” valued at $1,221,819, while South Carolina has none.\r\n\r\n  One sign of this want of ability even to read, in the slave states,\r\n  is too striking to be passed by. The staple reading of the\r\n  least-cultivated Americans is the newspapers, one of the lowest\r\n  forms of literature, though one of the most powerful, read even by\r\n  men who read nothing else. In the slave states there are published\r\n  but 377 newspapers, and in the free 1135. These numbers do not\r\n  express the entire difference in the case; for, as a general rule,\r\n  the circulation of the Southern newspapers is 50 to 75 per cent.\r\n  less than that of the North. Suppose, however, that each Southern\r\n  newspaper has two-thirds the circulation of a Northern journal, we\r\n  have then but 225 newspapers for the slave states! The more valuable\r\n  journals—the monthlies and quarterlies—are published almost entirely\r\n  in the free States.\r\n\r\n  The number of churches, the number and character of the clergy who\r\n  labor for these churches, are other measures of the intellectual and\r\n  moral condition of the people. The scientific character of the\r\n  Southern clergy has been already touched on. Let us compare the more\r\n  external facts.\r\n\r\n  In 1830, South Carolina had a population of 581,185 souls;\r\n  Connecticut, 297,675. In 1836, South Carolina had 364 ministers;\r\n  Connecticut, 498.\r\n\r\n  In 1834, there were in the slave states but 82,532 scholars in the\r\n  Sunday-schools; in the free states, 504,835; in the single State of\r\n  New York, 161,768.\r\n\r\nThe fact of constant emigration from slave states is also shown by such\r\nextracts from papers as the following, from the _Raleigh_ (N. C.)\r\n_Register_, quoted in the columns of the _National Era_:\r\n\r\n                    THEY WILL LEAVE NORTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n  Our attention was arrested, on Saturday last, by quite a long train\r\n  of wagons, winding through our streets, which, upon inquiry, we\r\n  found to belong to a party emigrating from Wayne county, in this\r\n  state, to the “far West.” This is but a repetition of many similar\r\n  scenes that we and others have witnessed during the past few years;\r\n  and such spectacles will be still more frequently witnessed, unless\r\n  something is done to retrieve our fallen fortunes at home.\r\n\r\n  If there be any one “consummation devoutly to be wished” in our\r\n  policy, it is that our young men should remain at home, and not\r\n  abandon their native state. From the early settlement of North\r\n  Carolina, the great drain upon her prosperity has been the spirit of\r\n  emigration, which has so prejudicially affected all the states of\r\n  the South. Her sons, hitherto neglected (if we must say it) by an\r\n  un-parental government, have wended their way, by hundreds upon\r\n  hundreds, from the land of their fathers,—that land, too, to make it\r\n  a paradise, wanting nothing but a market,—to bury their bones in the\r\n  land of strangers. We firmly believe that this emigration is caused\r\n  by the laggard policy of our people on the subject of internal\r\n  improvement, for man is not prone by nature to desert the home of\r\n  his affections.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _Era_ also quotes the following from the _Greensboro_\r\n(Ala.) _Beacon_:\r\n\r\n  “An unusually large number of movers have passed through this\r\n  village, within the past two or three weeks. On one day of last\r\n  week, upwards of thirty wagons and other vehicles belonging to\r\n  emigrants, mostly from Georgia and South Carolina, passed through on\r\n  their way, most of them bound to Texas and Arkansas.”\r\n\r\n  This tide of emigration does not emanate from an overflowing\r\n  population. Very far from it. Rather it marks an abandonment of a\r\n  soil which, exhausted by injudicious culture, will no longer repay\r\n  the labor of tillage. The emigrant, turning his back upon the homes\r\n  of his childhood, leaves a desolate region, it may be, and finds\r\n  that he can indulge in his feelings of local attachment only at the\r\n  risk of starvation.\r\n\r\n  How are the older states of the South to keep their population? We\r\n  say nothing of an increase, but how are they to hold their own? It\r\n  is useless to talk about strict construction, state rights, or\r\n  Wilmot Provisos. Of what avail can such things be to a sterile\r\n  desert, upon which people cannot subsist?\r\n\r\nIn the columns of the _National Era_, Oct. 2, 1851, also is the\r\nfollowing article, by its editor:\r\n\r\n                           STAND YOUR GROUND.\r\n\r\n  A citizen of Guilford county, N. C., in a letter to the _True\r\n  Wesleyan_, dated August 20th, 1851, writes:\r\n\r\n  “You may discontinue my paper for the present, as I am inclined to\r\n  go Westward, where I can enjoy religious liberty, and have my family\r\n  in a free country. Mobocracy has the ascendency here, and there is\r\n  no law. Brother Wilson had an appointment on Liberty Hill, on\r\n  Sabbath, 24th inst. The mob came armed, according to mob law, and\r\n  commenced operations on the meeting-house. They knocked all the\r\n  weather-boarding off, destroying doors, windows, pulpit, and\r\n  benches; and I have no idea that, if the mob was to kill a Wesleyan,\r\n  or one of their friends, that they would be hung.\r\n\r\n  “There is more moving this fall to the far West than was ever known\r\n  in one year. People do not like to be made slaves, and they are\r\n  determined to go where it is no crime to plead the cause of the poor\r\n  and oppressed. They have become alarmed at seeing the laws of God\r\n  trampled under foot with impunity, and that, too, by legislators,\r\n  sworn officers of the peace, and professors of religion. And even\r\n  ministers (so called) are justifying mobocracy. They think that such\r\n  a course of conduct will lead to a dissolution of the Union, and\r\n  then every man will have to fight in defence of slavery, or be\r\n  killed. This is an awful state of things, and, if the people were\r\n  destitute of the Bible, and the various means of information which\r\n  they possess, there might be some hope of reform. But there is but\r\n  little hope, under existing circumstances.”\r\n\r\n  We hope the writer will reconsider his purpose. In his section of\r\n  North Carolina there are very many anti-slavery men, and the\r\n  majority of the people have no interest in what is called slave\r\n  property. Let them stand their ground, and maintain the right of\r\n  free discussion. How is the despotism of Slavery to be put down, if\r\n  those opposed to it abandon their rights, and flee their country?\r\n  Let them do as the indomitable Clay does in Kentucky, and they will\r\n  make themselves respected.\r\n\r\nThe following is quoted, without comment, in the _National Era_, in\r\n1851, from the columns of the _Augusta Republic_ (Georgia).\r\n\r\n                     FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN GEORGIA.\r\n\r\n                                          {         _Warrenton (Ga.),_\r\n                                          { _Thursday, July 10, 1851._\r\n\r\n  This day the citizens of the town and county met in the court-house\r\n  at eight o’clock, A. M. On motion, Thomas F. Parsons, Esq., was\r\n  called to the chair, and Mr. Wm. H. Pilcher requested to act as\r\n  secretary.\r\n\r\n  The object of the meeting was stated by the chairman, as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_, our community has been thrown into confusion by the\r\n  presence among us of one Nathan Bird Watson, who hails from New\r\n  Haven (Conn.), and who has been promulgating abolition sentiments,\r\n  publicly and privately, among our people,—sentiments at war with our\r\n  institutions, and intolerable in a slave community,—and also been\r\n  detected in visiting suspicious negro houses, as we suppose for the\r\n  purpose of inciting our slaves and free negro population to\r\n  insurrection and insubordination.\r\n\r\n  The meeting having been organized, Wm. Gibson, Esq., offered the\r\n  following resolution, which, after various expressions of opinion,\r\n  was unanimously adopted, to wit:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That a committee of ten be appointed by the chairman for\r\n  the purpose of making arrangements to expel Nathan Bird Watson, an\r\n  avowed abolitionist, who has been in our village for three or four\r\n  weeks, by twelve o’clock this day, by the Georgia Railroad cars; and\r\n  that it shall be the duty of said committee to escort the said\r\n  Watson to Camak, for the purpose of shipment to his native land.\r\n\r\n  The following gentlemen were named as that committee:\r\n\r\n  William Gibson, E. Cody, J. M. Roberts, J. B. Huff, E. H. Pottle, E.\r\n  A. Brinkley, John C. Jennings, George W. Dickson, A. B. Rogers, and\r\n  Dr. R. W. Hubert.\r\n\r\n  On motion, the chairman was added to that committee.\r\n\r\n  It was, on motion,\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the proceedings of this meeting, with a minute\r\n  description of the said Watson, be forwarded to the publishers of\r\n  the Augusta papers, with the request that they, and all other\r\n  publishers of papers in the slave-holding states, publish the same\r\n  for a sufficient length of time.\r\n\r\n  DESCRIPTION.—The said Nathan Bird Watson is a man of dark\r\n  complexion, hazel eyes, black hair, and wears a heavy beard;\r\n  measures five feet eleven and three-quarter inches; has a quick\r\n  step, and walks with his toes inclined inward, and a little\r\n  stooped-shouldered; now wears a checked coat and white pants; says\r\n  he is twenty-three years of age, but will pass for twenty-five or\r\n  thirty.\r\n\r\n  On motion, the meeting was adjourned.\r\n\r\n                                        THOMAS F. PARSONS, _Chairman_.\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM H. PILCHER, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\nThis may be regarded as a specimen of that kind of editorial halloo\r\nwhich is designed to rouse and start in pursuit of a man the bloodhounds\r\nof the mob.\r\n\r\nThe following is copied by the _National Era_ from the _Richmond Times_:\r\n\r\n                               LYNCH LAW.\r\n\r\n  On the 13th inst. the vigilance committee of the county of Grayson,\r\n  in this state, arrested a man named John Cornutt [a friend and\r\n  follower of Bacon, the Ohio abolitionist], and, after examining the\r\n  evidence against him, required him to renounce his abolition\r\n  sentiments. This Cornutt refused to do; thereupon, he was stripped,\r\n  tied to a tree, and whipped. After receiving a dozen stripes, he\r\n  caved in, and promised, not only to recant, but to sell his property\r\n  in the county [consisting of land and negroes], and leave the state.\r\n  Great excitement prevailed throughout the country, and the\r\n  _Wytheville Republican_ of the 20th instant states that the\r\n  vigilance committee of Grayson were in hot pursuit of other\r\n  obnoxious persons.\r\n\r\nOn this outrage the _Wytheville Republican_ makes the following\r\ncomments:\r\n\r\n  Laying aside the white man, humanity to the negro, the slave,\r\n  demands that these abolitionists be dealt with summarily, and above\r\n  the law.\r\n\r\n  On Saturday, the 13th, we learn that the committee of vigilance of\r\n  that county, to the number of near two hundred, had before them one\r\n  John Cornutt, a citizen, a friend and backer of Bacon, and\r\n  promulgator of his abolition doctrines. They required him to\r\n  renounce abolitionism, and promise obedience to the laws. He\r\n  refused. They stripped him, tied him to a tree, and appealed to him\r\n  again to renounce, and promise obedience to the laws. He refused.\r\n  The rod was brought; one, two, three, and on to twelve, on the bare\r\n  back, and he cried out; he promised—and, more, he said he would sell\r\n  and leave.\r\n\r\n  This Mr. Cornutt owns land, negroes and money, say fifteen to twenty\r\n  thousand dollars. He has a wife, but no _white_ children. He has\r\n  among his negroes some born on his farm, of mixed blood. He is\r\n  believed to be a friend of the negro, even to amalgamation. He\r\n  intends to set his negroes free, and make them his heirs. It is\r\n  hoped he will retire to Ohio, and there finish his operations of\r\n  amalgamation and emancipation.\r\n\r\n  The vigilance committees were after another of Bacon’s men on\r\n  Thursday; we have not heard whether they caught him, nor what\r\n  followed. There are not more than six of his followers that adhere;\r\n  the rest have renounced him, and are much outraged at his\r\n  imposition.\r\n\r\nMr. Cornutt appealed for redress to the law. The result of his appeal is\r\nthus stated in the _Richmond_ (Va.) _Times_, quoted by the _National\r\nEra_:\r\n\r\n                        MORE TROUBLE IN GRAYSON.\r\n\r\n  The clerk of Grayson County Court having, on the 1st inst. (the\r\n  first day of Judge Brown’s term) tendered his resignation, and there\r\n  being no applicant for the office, and it being publicly stated at\r\n  the bar that no one would accept said appointment, Judge Brown found\r\n  himself unable to proceed with business, and accordingly adjourned\r\n  the court until the first day of the next term.\r\n\r\n  Immediately upon the adjournment of the court, a public meeting of\r\n  the citizens of the county was held, when resolutions were adopted\r\n  expressive of the determination of the people to maintain the stand\r\n  recently taken; exhorting the committees of vigilance to increased\r\n  activity in ferreting out all persons tinctured with abolitionism in\r\n  the county, and offering a reward of one hundred dollars for the\r\n  apprehension and delivery of one Jonathan Roberts to any one of the\r\n  committees of vigilance.\r\n\r\n  We have a letter from a credible correspondent in Carroll county,\r\n  which gives to the affair a still more serious aspect. Trusting that\r\n  there may be some error about it, we have no comments to make until\r\n  the facts are known with certainty. Our correspondent, whose letter\r\n  bears date the 13th inst., says:\r\n\r\n  “I learn, from an authentic source, that the Circuit Court that was\r\n  to sit in Grayson county during last week was dissolved by violence.\r\n  The circumstances were these. After the execution of the negroes in\r\n  that county, some time ago, who had been excited to rebellion by a\r\n  certain Methodist preacher, by the name of Bacon, of which you have\r\n  heard, the citizens held a meeting, and instituted a sort of\r\n  inquisition, to find out, if possible, who were the accomplices of\r\n  said Bacon. Suspicion soon rested on a man by the name of Cornutt,\r\n  and, on being charged with being an accomplice, he acknowledged the\r\n  fact, and declared his intention of persevering in the cause; upon\r\n  which he was severely lynched. Cornutt then instituted suit against\r\n  the parties, who afterwards _held a meeting and passed resolutions,\r\n  notifying the court and lawyers not to undertake the case, upon pain\r\n  of a coat of tar and feathers_. The court, however, convened at the\r\n  appointed time; and, true to their promise, _a band of armed men\r\n  marched around the court-house, fired their guns by platoons, and\r\n  dispersed the court in confusion_. _There was no blood shed._ This\r\n  county and the county of Wythe have held meetings and passed\r\n  resolutions sustaining the movement of the citizens of Grayson.”\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder that people emigrate from states where such things go\r\non?\r\n\r\nThe following accounts will show what ministers of the gospel will have\r\nto encounter who undertake faithfully to express their sentiments in\r\nslave states. The first is an article by Dr. Bailey, of the _Era_ of\r\nApril 3, 1852:\r\n\r\n                         LYNCHING IN KENTUCKY.\r\n\r\n  The _American Baptist_, of Utica, New York, publishes letters from\r\n  the Rev. Edward Matthews, giving an account of his barbarous\r\n  treatment in Kentucky.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Matthews, it seems, is an agent of the American Free Mission\r\n  Society, and, in the exercise of his agency, visited that state, and\r\n  took occasion to advocate from the pulpit anti-slavery sentiments.\r\n  Not long since, in the village of Richmond, Madison county, he\r\n  applied to several churches for permission to lecture on the moral\r\n  and religious condition of the slaves, but was unsuccessful.\r\n  February 1st, in the evening, he preached to the colored\r\n  congregation of that place, after which he was assailed by a mob,\r\n  and driven from the town. Returning in a short time, he left a\r\n  communication respecting the transaction at the office of the\r\n  _Richmond Chronicle_, and again departed; but had not gone far\r\n  before he was overtaken by four men, who seized him, and led him to\r\n  an out-of-the-way place, where they consulted as to what they should\r\n  do with him. They resolved to duck him, ascertaining first that he\r\n  could swim. Two of them took him and threw him into a pond, as far\r\n  as they could, and, on his rising to the surface, bade him come out.\r\n  He did so, and, on his refusing to promise never to come to\r\n  Richmond, they flung him in again. This operation was repeated four\r\n  times, when he yielded. They next demanded of him a promise that he\r\n  would leave Kentucky, and never return again. He refused to give it,\r\n  and they threw him in the water six times more, when, his strength\r\n  failing, and they threatening to whip him, he gave the pledge\r\n  required, and left the state.\r\n\r\n  We do not know anything about Mr. Matthews, or his mode of\r\n  promulgating his views. The laws in Kentucky for the protection of\r\n  what is called “slave property” are stringent enough, and nobody can\r\n  doubt the readiness of public sentiment to enforce their heaviest\r\n  penalties against offenders. If Mr. Matthews violated the law, he\r\n  should have been tried by the law; and he would have been, had he\r\n  committed an illegal act. No charge of the kind is made against him.\r\n\r\n  He was, then, the victim of Lynch law, administered in a ruffianly\r\n  manner, and without provocation; and the parties concerned in the\r\n  transaction, whatever their position in society, were guilty of\r\n  conduct as cowardly as it was brutal.\r\n\r\n  As to the manner in which Mr. Matthews has conducted himself in\r\n  Kentucky we know nothing. We transfer to our columns the following\r\n  extract from an editorial in the _Journal and Messenger_ of\r\n  Cincinnati, a Baptist paper, and which, it may be presumed, speaks\r\n  intelligently on the subject:\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Matthews is likewise a Baptist minister, whose _ostensible_\r\n  mission is one of love. If he has violated that mission, or _any\r\n  law_, he is amenable to God and _law_, and not to LAWLESS VIOLENCE.\r\n  His going to Kentucky is a matter of conscience to him, in which he\r\n  has a right to indulge. Many good anti-slavery men would question\r\n  the wisdom of such a step. None would doubt his RIGHT. Many, as a\r\n  matter of taste and propriety, cannot admire the way in which he is\r\n  reputed to do his work. But they believe he is conscientious, and\r\n  they know that ‘oppression maketh even a wise man mad.’ We do not\r\n  think, in obedience to Christ’s commands, he sufficiently counted\r\n  the cost. For no one in his position should go to Kentucky to\r\n  agitate the question of slavery, unless he EXPECTS TO DIE. No man in\r\n  this position, which Mr. Matthews occupies, can do it, without\r\n  falling a martyr. Liberty of speech and thought is not, _cannot_ be,\r\n  enjoyed in slave states. Slavery could not exist for a moment, if it\r\n  did. It is, doubtless, the duty of the Christian not to surrender\r\n  his life cheaply, for the sake of being a martyr. This would be an\r\n  unholy motive. It is his duty to preserve it until the last moment.\r\n  So Christ enjoins. It is no mark of cowardice to flee. ‘When they\r\n  persecute you in one city, flee into another,’ said the Saviour. But\r\n  he did not say, Give a _pledge_ that you will not exercise your\r\n  _rights_. Hence, he nor his disciples never did it. But it _is a\r\n  question_, after one has deliberated, and conscientiously entered a\r\n  community in the exercise of his constitutional and religious\r\n  rights, whether he should give a _pledge_, under the influence of a\r\n  _love of life, never to return_. If he does, he has not counted the\r\n  cost. A Christian should be as conscientious in pledging solemnly\r\n  not to do what he has an undoubted _right_ to do, as he is in\r\n  laboring for the emancipation of the slave.”\r\n\r\nThe following is from the _National Era_, July 10, 1851.\r\n\r\nMr. McBride wished to form a church of non-slaveholders.\r\n\r\n                      CASE OF REV. JESSE M’BRIDE.\r\n\r\n  This missionary, it will be remembered, was expelled lately from the\r\n  State of North Carolina.\r\n\r\n  We give below his letter detailing the conduct of the mob. His\r\n  letter is dated Guilford, May 6. After writing that he is suffering\r\n  from temporary illness, he proceeds:\r\n\r\n  “I would have kept within doors this day, but for the fact that I\r\n  mistrusted a mob would be out to disturb my congregation, though\r\n  such a hint had not been given me by a human being. About six\r\n  o’clock this morning I crawled into my carriage and drove eighteen\r\n  miles, which brought me to my meeting place, eight miles east of\r\n  Greensboro’,—the place I gave an account of a few weeks since,—where\r\n  some seven or eight persons gave their names to go into the\r\n  organization of a Wesleyan Methodist church. Well, sure enough, just\r\n  before meeting time (twelve o’clock) I was informed that a pack of\r\n  rioters were on hand, and that they had sworn I should not fulfil my\r\n  appointment this day. As they had heard nothing of this before, the\r\n  news came upon some of my friends like a clap of thunder from a\r\n  clear sky; they scarcely knew what to do. I told them I should go to\r\n  meeting or die in the attempt, and, like ‘good soldiers,’ they\r\n  followed. Just before I got to the arbor, I saw a man leave the\r\n  crowd and approach me at the left of my path. As I was about to\r\n  pass, he said:\r\n\r\n  “‘Mr. McBride, here’s a letter for you.’\r\n\r\n  “I took the letter, put it into my pocket, and said, ‘I have not\r\n  time to read it until after meeting.’\r\n\r\n  “‘No, you must read it _now_.’\r\n\r\n  “Seeing that I did not stop, he said, ‘I want to speak to you,’\r\n  beckoning with his hand, and turning, expecting me to follow.\r\n\r\n  “‘I will talk to you after meeting,’ said I, pulling out my watch;\r\n  ‘you see I have no time to spare—it is just twelve.’\r\n\r\n  “As I went to go in at the door of the stand, a man who had taken\r\n  his seat on the step rose up, placed his hand on me, and said, in a\r\n  very excited tone,\r\n\r\n  “‘Mr. McBride, you can’t go in here!’\r\n\r\n  “Without offering any resistance, or saying a word, I knelt down\r\n  outside the stand, on the ground, and prayed to my ‘Father;’ plead\r\n  His promises, such as, ‘When the enemy comes in like a flood, I\r\n  _will_ rear up a standard against him’; ‘I am a present help in\r\n  trouble;’ ‘I will fight all your battles for you;’ prayed for grace,\r\n  victory, my enemies, &c. Rose perfectly calm. Meantime my enemies\r\n  cursed and swore some, but most of the time they were rather quiet.\r\n  Mr. Hiatt, a slave-holder and merchant from Greensboro’, said,\r\n\r\n  “‘You can’t preach here to-day; we have come to prevent you. We\r\n  think you are doing harm—violating our laws,’ &c.\r\n\r\n  “‘From what authority do you thus command and prevent me from\r\n  preaching? Are you authorized by the civil authority to prevent me?’\r\n\r\n  “‘No, sir.’\r\n\r\n  “‘Has God sent you, and does he enjoin it on you as a duty to stop\r\n  me?’\r\n\r\n  “‘I am unacquainted with _Him_.’\r\n\r\n  “‘Well, acquaint now thyself with Him, and be at peace,’ and he will\r\n  give you a more honorable business than stopping men from preaching\r\n  his gospel. The judgment-day is coming on, and I summon you there,\r\n  to give an account of this day’s conduct. And now, gentlemen, if I\r\n  have violated the laws of North Carolina, by them I am willing to be\r\n  judged, condemned, and punished; to go to the whipping-post, pillory\r\n  or jail, or even to hug the stake. But, gentlemen, you are not\r\n  _generally_ a pack of ignoramuses; your good sense teaches you the\r\n  impropriety of your course; you _know_ that you are doing wrong; you\r\n  know that it is not right to trample all law, both human and divine,\r\n  in the dust, out of professed love for it. You must see that your\r\n  course will lead to perfect anarchy and confusion. The time may come\r\n  when Jacob Hiatt may be in the minority, when _his_ principles may\r\n  be as unpopular as Jesse McBride’s are _now_. What then? Why, if\r\n  _your_ course prevails, he must be lynched—whipped, stoned, tarred\r\n  and feathered, dragged from his own house, or his house burned over\r\n  his head, and he perish in the ruins. The persons became food for\r\n  the beasts they threw Daniel to; the same fire that was kindled for\r\n  the ‘Hebrew children’ consumed those who kindled it; Haman stretched\r\n  the same rope he prepared for Mordecai. Yours is a dangerous course,\r\n  and you must reap a retribution, either here or hereafter. We will\r\n  sing a hymn,’ said I.\r\n\r\n  “‘O yes,’ said H., ‘you may sing.’\r\n\r\n  “‘The congregation will please assist me, as I am quite unwell;’ and\r\n  I lined off the hymn, ‘Father, I stretch my hands to thee,’ &c.,\r\n  rioters and all helping to sing. All seemed in good humor, and I\r\n  almost forgot their errand. When we closed, I said, ‘Let us pray.’\r\n\r\n  “‘G—d d——n it, that’s not singing!’ said one of the company, who\r\n  stood back pretty well.\r\n\r\n  “While we invoked the divine blessing, I think many could say, ‘It\r\n  is good for us to be here.’ Before I rose from my knees, after the\r\n  friends rose, I delivered an exhortation of some ten or fifteen\r\n  minutes, in which I urged the brethren to steadfastness, prayer,\r\n  &c., some of the mob crying, ‘Lay hold of him!’ ‘Drag him out!’\r\n  ‘Stop him!’ &c.\r\n\r\n  “My voice being nearly drowned by the tumult, I left off. I was then\r\n  called to have some conversation with H., who repeated some of the\r\n  charges he preferred at first,—said I was bringing on insurrection,\r\n  causing disturbance, &c.; wishing me to leave the state; said he had\r\n  some slaves, and he himself was the most of a slave of any of them,\r\n  had harder times than they had, and he would like to be shut of\r\n  them, and that he was my true friend.\r\n\r\n  “‘As to your friendship, Mr. H., you have acted quite friendly,\r\n  remarkably so—fully as much so as Judas when he kissed the Saviour.\r\n  As to your having to be so much of a slave, I am sorry for you; you\r\n  _ought to be freed_. As to insurrection, I am decidedly opposed to\r\n  it, have no sympathy with it whatever. As to raising disturbance and\r\n  leaving the state, I left a little motherless daughter in Ohio, over\r\n  whom I wished to have an oversight and care. When I left, I only\r\n  expected to remain in North Carolina one year; but the people\r\n  dragged me up before the court under the charge of felony, put me in\r\n  bonds, and kept me; and now would you have me leave my securities to\r\n  suffer, have me lie and deceive the court?’\r\n\r\n  “‘O! if you will leave, your bail will not have to suffer; that can,\r\n  I think, be settled without much trouble,’ said Mr H.\r\n\r\n  “‘They _shall not_ have trouble on my account,’ said I.\r\n\r\n  “After talking with Mr. H. and one or two more on personal piety,\r\n  &c., I went to the arbor, took my seat in the door of the stand for\r\n  a minute; then rose, and, after referring to a few texts of\r\n  Scripture, to show that all those who will live godly shall suffer\r\n  persecution, I inquired, 1st, What is persecution? 2ndly, noticed\r\n  the fact, ‘shall suffer;’ gave a synoptical history of persecution,\r\n  by showing that Abel was the first martyr for the right—the\r\n  Israelites’ sufferings. The prophets were stoned, were sawn asunder,\r\n  were tempted, were slain with the sword, had to wander in deserts,\r\n  mountains, dens and caves of the earth, were driven from their\r\n  houses, given to ferocious beasts, lashed to the stake, and\r\n  destroyed in different ways. Spoke of John the Baptist; showed how\r\n  he was persecuted, and what the charge. Christ was persecuted for\r\n  doing what John was persecuted for not doing. Spoke of the\r\n  sufferings of the apostles, and their final death; of Luther and his\r\n  coadjutors; of the Wesleys and early Methodists; of Fox and the\r\n  early Quakers; of the early settlers in the colonies of the United\r\n  States. Noticed why the righteous were persecuted, the advantages\r\n  thereof to the righteous themselves, and how they should treat their\r\n  persecutors—with kindness, &c. Spoke, I suppose, some half an hour,\r\n  and dismissed. Towards the close, some of the rioters got quite\r\n  angry, and yelled, ‘Stop him!’ ‘Pull him out!’ ‘The righteous were\r\n  never persecuted for d——d abolitionism,’ &c. Some of them paid good\r\n  attention to what I said. And thus we spent the time from twelve to\r\n  three o’clock, and thus the meeting passed by.\r\n\r\n  “Brother dear, I am more and more confirmed in the righteousness of\r\n  our cause. I would rather, much rather, die for good principles,\r\n  than to have applause and honor for propagating false theories and\r\n  abominations. You perhaps would like to know how I feel. Happy, most\r\n  of the time; a religion that will not stand persecution will not\r\n  take us to heaven. Blessed be God, that I have not, thus far, been\r\n  suffered to deny Him. Sometimes I have thought that I was nearly\r\n  home. I generally feel a calmness of soul, but sometimes my\r\n  enjoyments are rapturous. I have had a great burden of prayer for\r\n  the dear flock; help me pray for them. Thank God, I have not heard\r\n  of one of them giving up or turning; and I believe some, if not most\r\n  of them, would go to the stake rather than give back. I forgot to\r\n  say I read a part of the fifth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles\r\n  to the rioters, commencing at the 17th verse. I told them, if their\r\n  institutions were of God, I could not harm them; that if our cause\r\n  was of God, _they could not stop it_—that they could kill me, but\r\n  they could _not kill_ the truth. Though I talked plainly, I talked\r\n  and felt kindly to them.\r\n\r\n  “I have had to write in such haste, and being fatigued and unwell,\r\n  my letter is disconnected. I meant to give you a copy of the letter\r\n  of the mob. Here it is:\r\n\r\n  “‘Mr. MCBRIDE:\r\n\r\n  “‘We, the subscribers, very and most respectfully request you not to\r\n  attempt to fulfil your appointment at this place. If you do, you\r\n  will surely be interrupted.\r\n\r\n                                               [Signed by 32 persons.]\r\n\r\n  “‘_May 6, 1851._’\r\n\r\n  “Some were professors of religion—Presbyterians, Episcopal\r\n  Methodists, and Methodist Protestants. One of the latter was an\r\n  ‘exhorter.’ I understand some of the crowd were negro-traders\r\n\r\n                                          “Farewell,      J. MCBRIDE.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  The writer is describing here a scene of recent occurrence in a slave\r\n  state, of whose particulars she has the best means of knowledge. The\r\n  work in question was “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n            THE INFLUENCE OF THE AMERICAN CHURCH ON SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no country in the world where the religious influence has a\r\ngreater ascendency than in America. There is no country where the clergy\r\nare more powerful. This is the more remarkable, because in America\r\nreligion is entirely divorced from the state, and the clergy have none\r\nof those artificial means for supporting their influence which result\r\nfrom rank and wealth. Taken as a body of men, the American clergy are\r\ngenerally poor. The salaries given to them afford only a bare support,\r\nand yield them no means of acquiring property. Their style of living can\r\nbe barely decent and respectable, and no more. The fact that, under\r\nthese circumstances, the American clergy are probably the most powerful\r\nbody of men in the country, is of itself a strong presumptive argument\r\nin their favor. It certainly argues in them, as a class, both\r\nintellectual and moral superiority.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that the influence of the clergy is looked upon\r\nby our statesmen as a most serious element in making up their political\r\ncombinations; and that that influence is so great, that no statesman\r\nwould ever undertake to carry a measure against which all the clergy of\r\nthe country should unite. Such a degree of power, though it be only a\r\npower of opinion, argument and example, is not without its dangers to\r\nthe purity of any body of men. To be courted by political partisans is\r\nalways a dangerous thing for the integrity and spirituality of men who\r\nprofess to be governed by principles which are not of this world. The\r\npossession, too, of so great a power as we have described, involves a\r\nmost weighty responsibility; since, if the clergy do possess the power\r\nto rectify any great national immorality, the fact of its not being done\r\nseems in some sort to bring the sin of the omission to their door.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken, thus far, of the clergy alone; but in America, where the\r\nclergyman is, in most denominations, elected by the church, and\r\nsupported by its voluntary contributions, the influence of the church\r\nand that of the clergy are, to a very great extent, identical. The\r\nclergyman is the very ideal and expression of the church. They choose\r\nhim, and retain him, because he expresses more perfectly than any other\r\nman they can obtain, their ideas of truth and right. The clergyman is\r\nsupported, in all cases, by his church, or else he cannot retain his\r\nposition in it. The fact of his remaining there is generally proof of\r\nidentity of opinion, since if he differed very materially from them,\r\nthey have the power to withdraw from him and choose another.\r\n\r\nThe influence of a clergyman, thus retained by the free consent of the\r\nunderstanding and heart of his church, is in some respects greater even\r\nthan that of a papal priest. The priest can control only by a blind\r\nspiritual authority, to which, very often, the reason demurs, while it\r\nyields an outward assent; but the successful free minister takes captive\r\nthe affections of the heart by his affections, overrules the reasoning\r\npowers by superior strength of reason, and thus, availing himself of\r\naffection, reason, conscience, and the entire man, possesses a power,\r\nfrom the very freedom of the organization, greater than can ever result\r\nfrom blind spiritual despotism. If a minister cannot succeed in doing\r\nthis to some good extent in a church, he is called unsuccessful; and he\r\nwho realizes this description most perfectly has the highest and most\r\nperfect kind of power, and expresses the idea of a successful American\r\nminister.\r\n\r\nIn speaking, therefore, of this subject, we shall speak of the church\r\nand the clergy as identical, using the word church in the American sense\r\nof the word, for that class of men, of all denominations, who are\r\n_organized_ in bodies distinct from nominal Christians, as professing to\r\nbe actually controlled by the precepts of Christ.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the influence of the church on this great question of\r\nslavery?\r\n\r\nCertain things are evident on the very face of the matter.\r\n\r\n1. It has not put an end to it.\r\n\r\n2. It has not prevented the increase of it.\r\n\r\n3. It has not occasioned the repeal of the laws which forbid education\r\nto the slave.\r\n\r\n4. It has not attempted to have laws passed forbidding the separation of\r\nfamilies and legalizing the marriage of slaves.\r\n\r\n5. It has not stopped the internal slavetrade.\r\n\r\n6. It has not prevented the extension of this system, with all its\r\nwrongs, over new territories.\r\n\r\nWith regard to these assertions it is presumed there can be no\r\ndifference of opinion.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, have they done?\r\n\r\nIn reply to this, it can be stated,\r\n\r\n1. That almost every one of the leading denominations have, at some\r\ntime, in their collective capacity, expressed a decided disapprobation\r\nof the system, and recommended that something should be done with a view\r\nto its abolition.\r\n\r\n2. One denomination of Christians has pursued such a course as entirely,\r\nand in fact, to free every one of its members from any participation in\r\nslave-holding. We refer to the Quakers. The course by which this result\r\nhas been effected will be shown by a pamphlet soon to be issued by the\r\npoet J. G. Whittier, one of their own body.\r\n\r\n3. Individual members, in all denominations, animated by the spirit of\r\nChristianity, have in various ways entered their protest against it.\r\n\r\nIt will be well now to consider more definitely and minutely the\r\nsentiments which some leading ecclesiastical bodies in the church have\r\nexpressed on this subject.\r\n\r\nIt is fair that the writer should state the sources from which the\r\nquotations are drawn. Those relating to the action of Southern\r\njudicatories are principally from a pamphlet compiled by the Hon. James\r\nG. Birney, and entitled “The Church the Bulwark of Slavery.” The writer\r\naddressed a letter to Mr. Birney, in which she inquired the sources from\r\nwhich he compiled. His reply was, in substance, as follows: That the\r\npamphlet was compiled from original documents, or files of newspapers,\r\nwhich had recorded these transactions at the time of their occurrence.\r\nIt was compiled and published in England, in 1842, with a view of\r\nleading the people there to understand the position of the American\r\nchurch and clergy. Mr. Birney says that, although the statements have\r\nlong been before the world, he has never known one of them to be\r\ndisputed; that, knowing the extraordinary nature of the sentiments, he\r\ntook the utmost pains to authenticate them.\r\n\r\nWe will first present those of the Southern States.\r\n\r\n1. The Presbyterian Church.\r\n\r\n                 HARMONY PRESBYTERY, OF SOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n  Whereas, sundry persons in Scotland and England, and others in the\r\n  north, east and west of our country, have denounced slavery as\r\n  obnoxious to the laws of God, some of whom have presented before the\r\n  General Assembly of our church, and the Congress of the nation,\r\n  memorials and petitions, with the avowed object of bringing into\r\n  disgrace slave-holders, and abolishing the relation of master and\r\n  slave: And whereas, from the said proceedings, and the statements,\r\n  reasonings and circumstances connected therewith, it is most\r\n  manifest that those persons “know not what they say, nor whereof\r\n  they affirm;” and with this ignorance discover a spirit of\r\n  self-righteousness and exclusive sanctity, &c., therefore,\r\n\r\n  1. _Resolved_, That as the kingdom of our Lord is not of this world,\r\n  His church, as such, has no right to abolish, alter, or affect any\r\n  institution or ordinance of men, political or civil, &c.\r\n\r\n  2. _Resolved_, That slavery has existed from the days of those good\r\n  old slave-holders and patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (who are\r\n  now in the kingdom of heaven), to the time when the apostle Paul\r\n  sent a runaway home to his master Philemon, and wrote a Christian\r\n  and fraternal letter to this slave-holder, which we find still\r\n  stands in the canon of the Scriptures; and that slavery has existed\r\n  ever since the days of the apostle, and does now exist.\r\n\r\n  3. _Resolved_, That as the relative duties of master and slave are\r\n  taught in the Scriptures, in the same manner as those of parent and\r\n  child, and husband and wife, the existence of slavery itself is not\r\n  opposed to the will of God; and whosoever has a conscience too\r\n  tender to recognize this relation as lawful is “righteous over\r\n  much,” is “wise above what is written,” and has submitted his neck\r\n  to the yoke of men, sacrificed his Christian liberty of conscience,\r\n  and leaves the infallible word of God for the fancies and doctrines\r\n  of men.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    THE CHARLESTON UNION PRESBYTERY.\r\n\r\n  It is a principle which meets the views of this body, that slavery,\r\n  as it exists among us, is a political institution, with which\r\n  ecclesiastical judicatories have not the smallest right to\r\n  interfere; and in relation to which, any such interference,\r\n  especially at the present momentous crisis, would be _morally\r\n  wrong_, and fraught with the most dangerous and pernicious\r\n  consequences. The sentiments which _we_ maintain, _in common with\r\n  Christians at the South of every denomination_, are sentiments which\r\n  so fully approve themselves to our consciences, are so identified\r\n  with our solemn convictions of duty, that we should maintain them\r\n  under any circumstances.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That in the opinion of this Presbytery, the holding of\r\n  slaves, so far from being a SIN in the sight of God, is nowhere\r\n  condemned in his holy word; that it is in accordance with the\r\n  example, or consistent with the precepts, of patriarchs, apostles\r\n  and prophets, and that it is compatible with the most fraternal\r\n  regard to the best good of those servants whom God may have\r\n  committed to our charge.\r\n\r\nThe New-school Presbyterian Church in Petersburgh, Virginia, Nov. 16,\r\n1838, passed the following:\r\n\r\n  Whereas, the General Assembly did, in the year 1818, pass a law\r\n  which contains provisions for slaves irreconcilable with our civil\r\n  institutions, and solemnly declaring slavery to be sin against God—a\r\n  law at once offensive and insulting to the whole Southern community,\r\n\r\n  1. _Resolved_, That, as slave-holders, we cannot consent longer to\r\n  remain in connection with any church where there exists a statute\r\n  conferring the right upon slaves to arraign their masters before the\r\n  judicatory of the church—_and that, too, for the act of selling them\r\n  without their consent first had been obtained_.\r\n\r\n  2. _Resolved_, That, as the Great Head of the church has recognized\r\n  the relation of _master and slave_, we conscientiously believe that\r\n  slavery is not a sin against God, as declared by the General\r\n  Assembly.\r\n\r\nThis sufficiently indicates the opinion of the Southern Presbyterian\r\nChurch. The next extracts will refer to the opinions of Baptist\r\nChurches. In 1835 the Charleston Baptist Association addressed a\r\nmemorial to the Legislature of South Carolina, which contains the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  The undersigned would further represent that the said association\r\n  does not consider that the Holy Scriptures have made the fact of\r\n  slavery _a question of morals at all_. The Divine Author of our holy\r\n  religion, in particular, found slavery a part of the existing\r\n  institutions of society; with which, if not sinful, it was not his\r\n  design to _intermeddle_, but to leave them entirely to the control\r\n  of men. Adopting this, therefore, as one of the allowed arrangements\r\n  of society, he made it the province of his religion only to\r\n  prescribe the reciprocal duties of the relation. The question, it is\r\n  believed, is purely one of political economy. It amounts, in effect,\r\n  to this,—_Whether the operatives of a country shall be bought and\r\n  sold, and themselves become property, as in this state; or whether\r\n  they shall be hirelings, and their labor only become property, as in\r\n  some other states_. In other words, whether an employer may buy the\r\n  whole time of laborers at once, of those who have a right to dispose\r\n  of it, with a permanent relation of protection and care over them;\r\n  or whether he shall be restricted to buy it in certain portions\r\n  only, subject to their control, and with no such permanent relation\r\n  of care and protection. _The right of masters to dispose of the time\r\n  of their slaves has been distinctly recognized by the Creator of all\r\n  things_, who is surely at liberty to vest the right of property over\r\n  any object in whomsoever he pleases. That the lawful possessor\r\n  should retain this right at will, is no more against the laws of\r\n  society and good morals, than that he should retain the personal\r\n  endowments with which his Creator has blessed him, or the money and\r\n  lands inherited from his ancestors, or acquired by his industry. And\r\n  neither society nor individuals have any more authority to demand a\r\n  relinquishment, without an equivalent, in the one case, than in the\r\n  other.\r\n\r\n  As it is a question purely of political economy, and one which in\r\n  this country is reserved to the cognizance of the state governments\r\n  severally, it is further believed, that the State of South Carolina\r\n  alone has the right to regulate the existence and condition of\r\n  slavery within her territorial limits; and we should resist to the\r\n  utmost every invasion of this right, come from what quarter and\r\n  under whatever pretence it may.\r\n\r\nThe Methodist Church is, in some respects, peculiarly situated upon this\r\nsubject, because its constitution and book of discipline contain the\r\nmost vehement denunciations against slavery of which language is\r\ncapable, and the most stringent requisitions that all members shall be\r\ndisciplined for the holding of slaves; and these denunciations and\r\nrequisitions have been reäffirmed by its General Conference.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be necessary, therefore, for the Southern Conference to\r\ntake some notice of this fact, which they did, with great coolness and\r\ndistinctness, us follows:\r\n\r\n                     THE GEORGIA ANNUAL CONFERENCE.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved, unanimously_, That, whereas there is a clause in the\r\n  discipline of our church which states that we are as much as ever\r\n  convinced of the great evil of _slavery_; and whereas the said\r\n  clause has been _perverted_ by some, and used in such a manner as to\r\n  produce the impression that the Methodist Episcopal Church believed\r\n  _slavery_ to be a _moral evil_:—\r\n\r\n  Therefore _Resolved_, That it is the sense of the Georgia Annual\r\n  Conference that slavery, as it exists in the United States, _is not\r\n  a moral evil_.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That we view _slavery_ as a civil and domestic\r\n  institution, and one with which, as ministers of Christ, we have\r\n  nothing to do, further than to ameliorate the condition of the slave\r\n  by endeavoring to impart to him and his master the benign influences\r\n  of the religion of Christ, and aiding both on their way to heaven.\r\n\r\n  On motion, it was _Resolved_, unanimously, That the Georgia Annual\r\n  Conference regard with feelings of profound respect and approbation\r\n  the dignified course pursued by _our several superintendents_, or\r\n  bishops, _in suppressing_ the attempts that have been made by\r\n  various individuals to get up and protract an excitement in the\r\n  churches and country on the subject of _abolitionism_.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, further, That they shall have our cordial and zealous\r\n  support in sustaining them in the ground they have taken.\r\n\r\n                       SOUTH CAROLINA CONFERENCE.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. W. Martin introduced resolutions similar to those of the\r\nGeorgia Conference.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. W. Capers, D.D., after expressing his conviction that “the\r\nsentiment of the resolutions was universally held, not only by the\r\nministers of that conference, but of the whole South;” and after stating\r\nthat the only true doctrine was, “it belongs to Cæsar, and not to the\r\nchurch,” offered the following as a substitute:\r\n\r\n  Whereas, we hold that the subject of slavery in these United States\r\n  is not one proper for the action of the church, but is exclusively\r\n  appropriate to the civil authorities,\r\n\r\n  Therefore _Resolved_, That this conference will not intermeddle with\r\n  it, further than to express our regret that it has ever been\r\n  introduced, in any form, into any one of the judicatures of the\r\n  church.\r\n\r\n  Brother Martin accepted the substitute.\r\n\r\n  Brother Betts asked whether the substitute was intended _as implying\r\n  that slavery, as it exists among us, was not a moral evil_? _He\r\n  understood it as equivalent to such a declaration._\r\n\r\n  Brother Capers explained _that his intention was to convey that\r\n  sentiment fully and unequivocally_; and that he had chosen the form\r\n  of the substitute for the purpose, _not only of reproving some wrong\r\n  doings at the North_, but with reference also to the General\r\n  Conference. If slavery were a _moral evil_ (that is, _sinful_), _the\r\n  church would be bound to take cognizance of it_; but our affirmation\r\n  is, that it is not a matter for _her_ jurisdiction, but is\r\n  exclusively appropriate to the _civil government_, and _of course\r\n  not sinful_.\r\n\r\nThe substitute was then unanimously adopted.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, an Episcopal clergyman in North Carolina, of the name of\r\nFreeman, preached, in the presence of his bishop (Rev. Levi. S. Ives,\r\nD.D., a native of a free state), two sermons on the rights and duties of\r\nslave-holders. In these he essayed to justify from the Bible the slavery\r\nboth of white men and negroes, and insisted that “_without a new\r\nrevelation from heaven, no man was authorized to pronounce slavery_\r\nWRONG.” The sermons were printed in a pamphlet, prefaced with a letter\r\nto Mr. Freeman from the Bishop of North Carolina, declaring that he had\r\n“listened with most unfeigned pleasure” to his discourses, and advised\r\ntheir publication, as being “urgently called for at the present time.”\r\n\r\n“The Protestant Episcopal Society for the advancement of Christianity\r\n(!) in South Carolina” thought it expedient to republish Mr. Freeman’s\r\npamphlet as _a religious tract_![24]\r\n\r\nAfterwards, when the addition of the new State of Texas made it\r\nimportant to organize the Episcopal Church there, this Mr. Freeman was\r\nmade Bishop of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe question may now arise,—it must arise to every intelligent thinker\r\nin Christendom,—Can it be possible that American slavery, _as defined by\r\nits laws_, and the decisions of its courts, including all the horrible\r\nabuses that the laws recognize and sanction, is considered to be a right\r\nand proper institution? Do these Christians merely recognize the\r\nrelation of slavery, in the abstract, as one that, under proper\r\nlegislation, might be made a good one, or do they justify it _as it\r\nactually exists_ in America?\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that there is a large party at the South who justify not\r\nonly slavery in the abstract, but slavery just as it exists in America,\r\nin whole and in part, and even its worst abuses.\r\n\r\nThere are four legalized parts or results of the system, which are of\r\nespecial atrocity.\r\n\r\nThey are,—\r\n\r\n1. _The prohibition of the testimony of colored people in cases of\r\ntrial._\r\n\r\n2. The forbidding of education.\r\n\r\n3. The internal slave-trade.\r\n\r\n4. The consequent separation of families.\r\n\r\nWe shall bring evidence to show that every one of these practices has\r\nbeen either defended on principle, or recognized without condemnation,\r\nby decisions of judicatories of churches, or by writings of influential\r\nclergymen, without any expression of dissent being made to their\r\nopinions by the bodies to which they belong.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the exclusion of colored testimony in the church. In\r\n1840, the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church passed\r\nthe following resolution: “THAT IT IS INEXPEDIENT AND UNJUSTIFIABLE FOR\r\nANY PREACHER TO PERMIT COLORED PERSONS TO GIVE TESTIMONY AGAINST WHITE\r\nPERSONS IN ANY STATE WHERE THEY ARE DENIED THAT PRIVILEGE BY LAW.”\r\n\r\nThis was before the Methodist Church had separated on the question of\r\nslavery, as they subsequently did, into Northern and Southern\r\nConferences. Both Northern and Southern members voted for this\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nAfter this was passed, the conscience of many Northern ministers was\r\naroused, and they called for a reconsideration. The Southern members\r\nimperiously demanded that it should remain as a compromise and test of\r\nunion. The spirit of the discussion may be inferred from one extract.\r\n\r\nMr. Peck, of New York, who moved the reconsideration of the resolution,\r\nthus expressed himself:\r\n\r\n  That resolution (said he) was introduced under peculiar\r\n  circumstances, during considerable excitement, and he went for it\r\n  _as a peace-offering to the South_, without sufficiently reflecting\r\n  upon the precise import of its phraseology; but, after a little\r\n  deliberation, he was sorry; and he had been sorry but once, and that\r\n  was all the time; he was convinced that, if that resolution remain\r\n  upon the journal, _it would be disastrous to the whole Northern\r\n  church_.\r\n\r\nRev. Dr. A. J. Few, of Georgia, the mover of the original resolution,\r\nthen rose. The following are extracts from his speech. The Italics are\r\nthe writers.\r\n\r\n  Look at it! What do you declare to us, in taking this course? Why,\r\n  simply, as much as to say, “We cannot sustain you in the condition\r\n  which you cannot avoid!” We cannot sustain you in the _necessary\r\n  conditions_ of slave-holding; one of its _necessary conditions_\r\n  being the rejection of negro testimony! If it is not sinful to hold\r\n  slaves, under all circumstances, _it is not sinful to hold them in\r\n  the only condition, and under the only circumstances, which they can\r\n  be held_. The rejection of negro testimony is one of the necessary\r\n  circumstances under which slave-holding can exist; indeed, it is\r\n  utterly impossible for it to exist without it; therefore it is not\r\n  sinful to hold slaves _in the condition and under the circumstances\r\n  which they are held at the South, inasmuch as they can be held under\r\n  no other circumstances_. * * * If you believe that slave-holding is\r\n  necessarily sinful, come out with the abolitionists, and honestly\r\n  say so. If you believe that slave-holding is necessarily sinful, you\r\n  believe we are necessarily sinners; and, if so, come out and\r\n  honestly declare it, _and let us leave you_. * * * We want to know\r\n  distinctly, precisely and honestly, the position which you take. We\r\n  cannot be tampered with by you any longer. We have had enough of it.\r\n  We are tired of your sickly sympathies. * * * If you are not opposed\r\n  to the principles which it involves, unite with us, _like honest\r\n  men_, and go home, and boldly meet the consequences. We say again,\r\n  you are responsible for this state of things; for it is _you_ who\r\n  have driven us to the alarming point where we find ourselves. * * *\r\n  _You_ have made that resolution absolutely necessary to the quiet of\r\n  the South! But _you_ now revoke that resolution! And you pass the\r\n  Rubicon! Let me not be misunderstood. I say, _you_ pass the Rubicon!\r\n  If you revoke, you revoke the principle which that resolution\r\n  involves, and you array the whole South against you, _and we must\r\n  separate_! * * * If you accord to the principles which it involves,\r\n  arising from the necessity of the case, stick by it, “though the\r\n  heavens perish!” But, if you persist on reconsideration, I ask in\r\n  what light will your course be regarded in the South? What will be\r\n  the conclusion, there, in reference to it? Why, that you cannot\r\n  sustain us as long as we hold slaves! It will declare, in the face\r\n  of the sun, “We cannot sustain you, gentlemen, while you retain your\r\n  slaves!” Your opposition to the resolution is based upon your\r\n  opposition to slavery; you cannot, therefore, maintain your\r\n  consistency, unless you come out with the abolitionists, and condemn\r\n  us at once and forever; or else refuse to reconsider.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was therefore left in force, with another resolution\r\nappended to it, expressing _the undiminished regard of the General\r\nConference for the colored population_.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that it _was undiminished_, for the best of reasons.\r\nThat the colored population were not properly impressed with this last\r\nact of condescension, appears from the fact that “the official members\r\nof the Sharp-street and Asbury Colored Methodist Church in Baltimore”\r\nprotested and petitioned against the motion. The following is a passage\r\nfrom their address:\r\n\r\n  The adoption of such a resolution, by our highest ecclesiastical\r\n  judicatory,—a judicatory composed of the most experienced and wisest\r\n  brethren in the church, the choice selection of twenty-eight Annual\r\n  Conferences,—has inflicted, we fear, an irreparable injury upon\r\n  eighty thousand souls for whom Christ died—souls, who, by this act\r\n  of your body, have been stripped of the dignity of Christians,\r\n  degraded in the scale of humanity, and treated as criminals, for no\r\n  other reason than the color of their skin! Your resolution has, in\r\n  our humble opinion, _virtually_ declared, that a mere physical\r\n  peculiarity, the handiwork of our all-wise and benevolent Creator,\r\n  is _prima facie_ evidence of incompetency to tell the truth, or is\r\n  an unerring indication of unworthiness to bear testimony against a\r\n  fellow-being whose skin is denominated white. * * *\r\n\r\n  Brethren, out of the abundance of the heart we have spoken. _Our\r\n  grievance is before you!_ If you have any regard for the salvation\r\n  of the eighty thousand immortal souls committed to your care; if you\r\n  would not _thrust_ beyond the pale of the church _twenty-five\r\n  hundred souls in this city_, who have felt determined never to leave\r\n  the church that has nourished and brought them up; if you regard us\r\n  as children of one common Father, and can, upon reflection,\r\n  sympathize with us as members of the body of Christ,—if you would\r\n  not incur the fearful, the tremendous responsibility of offending\r\n  not only one, but many thousands of his “little ones,” we conjure\r\n  you to wipe from your journal the odious resolution which is ruining\r\n  our people.\r\n\r\n“A Colored Baltimorean,” writing to the editor of _Zion’s Watchman_,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  The address was presented to one of the secretaries, a delegate of\r\n  the Baltimore Conference, and subsequently given by him to the\r\n  bishops. How many of the members of the conference saw it, I know\r\n  not. One thing is certain, _it was not read to the conference_.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second head,—of defending the laws which prevent the\r\nslave from being taught to read and write,—we have the following\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1835, the Chillicothe Presbytery, Ohio, addressed a\r\nChristian remonstrance to the presbytery of Mississippi on the subject\r\nof slavery, in which they specifically enumerated the respects in which\r\nthey considered it to be unchristian. The eighth resolution was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  That any member of our church, who shall advocate or speak in favor\r\n  of such laws as have been or may yet be enacted, for the purpose of\r\n  keeping the slaves in ignorance, and preventing them from learning\r\n  to read the word of God, is guilty of a great sin, and ought to be\r\n  dealt with as for other scandalous crimes.\r\n\r\nThis remonstrance was answered by Rev. James Smylie, stated clerk of the\r\nMississippi Presbytery, and afterwards of the Amity Presbytery of\r\nLouisiana, in a pamphlet of eighty-seven pages, in which he defended\r\nslavery generally and particularly, in the same manner in which all\r\nother abuses have always been defended—by the word of God. The tenth\r\nsection of this pamphlet is devoted to the defence of this law. He\r\ndevotes seven pages of fine print to this object. He says (p. 63):\r\n\r\n  There are laws existing in both states, Mississippi and Louisiana,\r\n  accompanied with heavy penal sanctions, prohibiting the teaching of\r\n  the slaves to read, _and meeting the approbation of the religious\r\n  part of the reflecting community_.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe adds, still further:\r\n\r\n  _The laws preventing the slaves from learning to read are a fruitful\r\n  source of much ignorance and immorality among the slaves._ The\r\n  printing, publishing, and circulating of abolition and emancipatory\r\n  principles in those states, was the cause of the passage of those\r\n  laws.\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to say that the ignorance and vice which are the\r\nconsequence of those laws do not properly belong to those who made the\r\nlaws, but to those whose emancipating doctrines rendered them necessary.\r\nSpeaking of these consequences of ignorance and vice, he says:\r\n\r\n  Upon whom must they be saddled? If you will allow me to answer the\r\n  question, I will answer by saying, Upon such great and good men as\r\n  John Wesley, Jonathan Edwards, Bishop Porteus, Paley, Horsley,\r\n  Scott, Clark, Wilberforce, Sharpe, Clarkson, Fox, Johnson, Burke,\r\n  and other great and good men, who, without examining the word of\r\n  God, have concluded that it is a true maxim that slavery is in\r\n  itself sinful.\r\n\r\nHe then illustrates the necessity of these laws by the following simile.\r\nHe supposes that the doctrine had been promulgated that the authority of\r\nparents was an unjust usurpation, and that it was getting a general hold\r\nof society; that societies were being formed for the emancipation of\r\nchildren from the control of their parents; that all books were\r\nbeginning to be pervaded by this sentiment; and that, under all these\r\ninfluences, children were becoming restless and fractious. He supposes\r\nthat, under these circumstances, parents meet and refer the subject to\r\nlegislators. He thus describes the dilemma of the legislators:\r\n\r\n  These meet, and they take the subject seriously and solemnly into\r\n  consideration. On the one hand, they perceive that, if their\r\n  children had access to these doctrines, they were ruined forever. To\r\n  let them have access to them was unavoidable, if they taught them to\r\n  read. To prevent their being taught to read was cruel, and would\r\n  prevent them from obtaining as much knowledge of the laws of Heaven\r\n  as otherwise they might enjoy. In this sad dilemma, sitting and\r\n  consulting in a legislative capacity, they must, of two evils,\r\n  choose the least. With indignant feelings towards those, who, under\r\n  the influence of “seducing spirits,” had sent and were sending among\r\n  them “doctrines of devils,” but with aching hearts towards their\r\n  children, they resolved that their children should not be taught to\r\n  read, until the storm should be overblown; hoping that Satan’s being\r\n  let loose will be but for a little season. And during this season\r\n  they will have to teach them orally, and thereby guard against their\r\n  being contaminated by these wicked doctrines.\r\n\r\nSo much for that law.\r\n\r\nNow, as for the internal slave-trade,—the very essence of that trade is\r\nthe buying and selling of human beings _for the mere purposes of gain_.\r\n\r\nA master who has slaves transmitted to him, or a master who buys slaves\r\nwith the purpose of retaining them on his plantation or in his family,\r\ncan be supposed to have some object in it besides the _mere purpose of\r\ngain_. He may be supposed, in certain cases, to have some regard to the\r\nhappiness or well-being of the slave. The trader buys and sells _for the\r\nmere purpose of gain_.\r\n\r\nConcerning this abuse the Chillicothe Presbytery, in the document to\r\nwhich we have alluded, passed the following resolution:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the buying, selling, or holding of a slave, _for\r\n  the sake of gain_, is a heinous sin and scandal, requiring the\r\n  cognizance of the judicatories of the church.\r\n\r\nIn the reply from which we have already quoted, Mr. Smylie says (p. 13):\r\n\r\n  _If the buying, selling and holding of a slave for the sake of\r\n  gain_, is, as you say, a heinous sin and scandal, then verily\r\n  three-fourths of all Episcopalians, Methodists, Baptists and\r\n  Presbyterians, in the eleven states of the Union, are of the devil.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n  To question whether slave-holders or slave-buyers are of the devil,\r\n  seems to me like calling in question whether God is or is not a true\r\n  witness; that is, provided it is God’s testimony, and not merely the\r\n  testimony of the Chillicothe Presbytery, that it is a “heinous sin\r\n  and scandal” to buy, sell and hold slaves.\r\n\r\nAgain (p. 21):\r\n\r\n  If language can convey a clear and definite meaning at all, I know\r\n  not how it can more plainly or unequivocally present to the mind any\r\n  thought or idea, than the twenty-fifth chapter of Leviticus clearly\r\n  and unequivocally establishes the fact that slavery was sanctioned\r\n  by God himself, and that buying, selling, holding and bequeathing\r\n  slaves, _as property, are regulations which are established by\r\n  himself_.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  What language can more explicitly show, not that God winked at\r\n  slavery merely, but that, to say the least, he gave a _written\r\n  permit_ to the Hebrews, then the best people in the world, to _buy,\r\n  hold and bequeath, men and women_, to perpetual servitude! What,\r\n  now, becomes of the position of the Chillicothe Presbytery? * * * *\r\n  Is it, indeed, a fact, that God once gave a written permission to\r\n  his own dear people [“_ye shall buy_”] to do that which is in itself\r\n  sinful? Nay, to do that which the Chillicothe Presbytery says “is a\r\n  heinous sin and scandal”?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  God resolves that his own children may, or rather “_shall_,” “_buy,\r\n  possess and hold_,” bond-men and bond-women, in bondage, _forever_.\r\n  But the Chillicothe Presbytery resolves that “_buying, selling, or\r\n  holding slaves_, for the sake of gain, is a _heinous sin and\r\n  scandal_.”\r\n\r\nWe do not mean to say that Mr. Smylie had the internal slave-trade\r\ndirectly in his mind in writing these sentences; but we do say that no\r\nslave-trader would ask for a more explicit justification of his trade\r\nthan this.\r\n\r\nLastly, in regard to that dissolution of the marriage relation, which is\r\nthe necessary consequence of this kind of trade, the following decisions\r\nhave been made by judicatories of the church.\r\n\r\nThe Savannah River (Baptist) Association, in 1835, in reply to the\r\nquestion,\r\n\r\n  Whether, in a case of involuntary separation, of such a character as\r\n  to preclude all prospect of future intercourse, the parties ought to\r\n  be allowed to marry again?\r\n\r\nanswered,\r\n\r\n  That such a separation, among persons situated as our slaves are, is\r\n  _civilly_ a separation by _death_, and they believe that, in the\r\n  sight of God, it would be so viewed. To forbid second marriages, in\r\n  such cases, would be to expose the parties, not only to stronger\r\n  hardships and strong temptation, but to _church censure_, for acting\r\n  in obedience to their masters, who cannot be expected to acquiesce\r\n  in a regulation at variance with justice to the slaves, and to the\r\n  spirit of that command which regulates marriage among Christians.\r\n  _The slaves are not free agents_, and a dissolution by death, is not\r\n  more entirely without their consent, and beyond their control, than\r\n  by such separation.\r\n\r\nAt the Shiloh Baptist Association, which met at Gourdvine, a few years\r\nsince, the following query, says the _Religious Herald_, was presented\r\nfrom Hedgman church, viz:\r\n\r\n  Is a servant, whose husband or wife has been sold by his or her\r\n  master into a distant country, to be permitted to marry again?\r\n\r\nThe query was referred to a committee, who made the following report;\r\nwhich, after discussion, was adopted:\r\n\r\n  That, in view of the circumstances in which servants in this country\r\n  are placed, the committee are unanimous in the opinion that it is\r\n  better to permit servants thus circumstanced to take another husband\r\n  or wife.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Charles C. Jones, who was an earnest and indefatigable\r\nlaborer for the good of the slave, and one who, it would be supposed,\r\nwould be likely to feel strongly on this subject, if any one would,\r\nsimply remarks, in estimating the moral condition of the negroes, that,\r\nas husband and wife are subject to all the vicissitudes of property, and\r\nmay be separated by division of estate, debts, sales or removals, &c.\r\n&c., the marriage relation naturally loses much of its sacredness, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  It is a contract of convenience, profit or pleasure, that may be\r\n  entered into and dissolved at the will of the parties, and that\r\n  without heinous sin, or injury to the property interests of any one.\r\n\r\nIn this sentence he is expressing, as we suppose, the _common_ idea of\r\nslaves and masters of the nature of this institution, and not his own.\r\nWe infer this from the fact that he endeavors in his catechism to\r\nimpress on the slave the sacredness and perpetuity of the relation. But,\r\nwhen the most pious and devoted men that the South has, and those\r\nprofessing to spend their lives for the service of the slave, thus\r\ncalmly, and without any reprobation, contemplate this state of things as\r\na state with which Christianity does not call on them to interfere, what\r\ncan be expected of the world in general?\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked, with regard to the sentiments of Mr. Smylie’s\r\npamphlet, that they are endorsed in the appendix by a document in the\r\nname of two presbyteries, which document, though with less minuteness of\r\ninvestigation, takes the same ground with Mr. Smylie. This Rev. James\r\nSmylie was one who, in company with the Rev. John L. Montgomery, was\r\nappointed by the synod of Mississippi, in 1839, to write or compile a\r\ncatechism for the instruction of the negroes.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones says, in his “History of the Religious Instruction of the\r\nNegroes” (p. 83): “The Rev. James Smylie and the Rev. C. Blair are\r\nengaged in this good work (of enlightening the negroes) systematically\r\nand constantly in Mississippi.” The former clergyman is characterized as\r\nan “aged and indefatigable father.” “His success in enlightening the\r\nnegroes has been very great. A large proportion of the negroes in his\r\nold church can recite both Williston’s and the Westminster Catechism\r\nvery accurately.” The writer really wishes that it were in her power to\r\nmake copious extracts from Mr. Smylie’s pamphlet. A great deal could be\r\nlearned from it as to what style of mind, and habits of thought, and\r\nmodes of viewing religious subjects, are likely to grow up under such an\r\ninstitution. The man is undoubtedly and heartily sincere in his\r\nopinions, and appears to maintain them with a most abounding and\r\ntriumphant joyfulness, as the very latest improvement in theological\r\nknowledge. We are tempted to present a part of his _Introduction_,\r\nsimply for the light it gives us on the style of thinking which is to be\r\nfound on our south-western waters:\r\n\r\n  In presenting the following review to the public, the author was not\r\n  entirely or mainly influenced by a desire or hope to correct the\r\n  views of the Chillicothe Presbytery. He hoped the publication would\r\n  be of essential service to others, as well as to the presbytery.\r\n\r\n  From his intercourse with religious societies of all denominations,\r\n  in Mississippi and Louisiana, he was aware that the abolition maxim,\r\n  namely, _that slavery is in itself sinful_, had gained on and\r\n  entwined itself among the religious and conscientious scruples of\r\n  many in the community so far as not only to render them unhappy, but\r\n  to draw off the attention from the great and important duty of a\r\n  householder to his household. The eye of the mind, resting on\r\n  slavery itself as a corrupt fountain, from which, of necessity,\r\n  nothing but corrupt streams could flow, was incessantly employed in\r\n  search of some plan by which, with safety, the fountain could, in\r\n  some future time, be entirely dried up; never reflecting, or\r\n  dreaming, that slavery, in itself considered, was an innoxious\r\n  relation, and that the whole error rested in the neglect of the\r\n  relative duties of the relation.\r\n\r\n  If there be a consciousness of guilt resting on the mind, it is all\r\n  the same, as to the effect, whether the conscience is or is not\r\n  right. Although the word of God alone ought to be the guide of\r\n  conscience, yet it is not always the case. Hence, conscientious\r\n  scruples sometimes exist for neglecting to do that which the word of\r\n  God condemns.\r\n\r\n  The Bornean who neglects to kill his father, and to eat him with his\r\n  dates, when he has become old, is sorely tortured by the wringings\r\n  of a guilty conscience, when his filial tenderness and sympathy have\r\n  gained the ascendency over his apprehended duty of killing his\r\n  parent. In like manner, many a slave-holder, whose conscience is\r\n  guided, not by the word of God, but by the doctrines of men, is\r\n  often suffering the lashes of a guilty conscience, even when he\r\n  renders to his slave “that which is just and equal,” according to\r\n  the Scriptures, simply because he does not emancipate his slave,\r\n  irrespective of the benefit or injury done by such an act.\r\n\r\n  “How beautiful upon the mountains,” in the apprehension of the\r\n  reviewer, “would be the feet of him that would bring” to the Bornean\r\n  “the glad tidings” that his conduct, in sparing the life of his\r\n  tender and affectionate parent, was no sin! * * * * Equally\r\n  beautiful and delightful, does the reviewer trust, will it be, to an\r\n  honest, scrupulous and conscientious slave-holder, to learn, from\r\n  the word of God, the glad tidings that slavery itself is not sinful.\r\n  Released now from an incubus that paralyzed his energies in\r\n  discharge of duty towards his slaves, he goes forth cheerfully to\r\n  energetic action. It is not now as formerly, when he viewed slavery\r\n  as in itself sinful. He can now pray, with the hope of being heard,\r\n  that God will bless his exertions to train up his slaves “in the\r\n  nurture and admonition of the Lord:” whereas, before, he was\r\n  retarded by this consideration,—“If I regard iniquity in my heart,\r\n  the Lord will not hear me.” Instead of hanging down his head, moping\r\n  and brooding over his condition, as formerly, without action, he\r\n  raises his head, and moves on cheerfully, in the plain path of duty.\r\n\r\n  He is no more tempted to look askance at the word of God, and\r\n  saying, “Hast thou found me, O mine enemy,” come to “filch from me”\r\n  my slaves, which, “while not enriching” them, “leaves me poor\r\n  indeed?” Instead of viewing the word of God, as formerly, come with\r\n  whips and scorpions to chastise him into paradise, he feels that its\r\n  “ways are ways of pleasantness, and its paths peace.” Distinguishing\r\n  now between the real word of God and what are only the doctrines and\r\n  commandments of men, the mystery is solved, which was before\r\n  insolvable, namely, “The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing\r\n  the heart.”\r\n\r\nIf you should undertake to answer such a man by saying that his argument\r\nproves too much,—that neither Christ nor his apostles bore any explicit\r\ntestimony against the gladiatorial shows and the sports of the arena,\r\nand, therefore, it would be right to get them up in America,—the\r\nprobability seems to be that he would heartily assent to it, and think,\r\non the whole, that it might be a good speculation. As a further specimen\r\nof the free-and-easy facetiousness which seems to be a trait in this\r\nproduction, see, on p. 58, where the Latin motto _Facilis descensus\r\nAverni sed revocare_, &c., receives the following quite free and truly\r\nWestern translation, which, he good-naturedly says, is given for the\r\nbenefit of those who do not understand Latin,—“It is easy to go to the\r\ndevil, but the devil to get back.”\r\n\r\nSome uncharitable people might, perhaps, say that the preachers of such\r\ndoctrines are as likely as anybody to have an experimental knowledge on\r\nthis point. The idea of this jovial old father instructing a class of\r\nblack “Sams” and young “Topsys” in the mysteries of the Assembly’s\r\nCatechism is truly picturesque!\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Smylie’s opinions on the subject of slavery have been amply\r\nsupported and carried out by leading clergymen in every denomination, we\r\nmight give volumes of quotations to show.\r\n\r\nA second head, however, is yet to be considered, with regard to the\r\ninfluence of the Southern church and clergy.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the Southern political community have taken their\r\nstand upon the position that the institution of slavery shall not be\r\nopen to discussion. In many of the slave states stringent laws exist,\r\nsubjecting to fine and imprisonment, and even death, any who speak or\r\npublish anything upon the subject, except in its favor. They have not\r\nonly done this with regard to citizens of slave states, but they have\r\nshown the strongest disposition to do it with regard to citizens of free\r\nstates; and when these discussions could not be repelled by regular law,\r\nthey have encouraged the use of illegal measures. In the published\r\nletters and speeches of Horace Mann the following examples are given (p.\r\n467). In 1831 the Legislature of Georgia offered five thousand dollars\r\nto any one who would arrest and bring to trial and conviction, in\r\nGeorgia, a citizen of Massachusetts, named William Lloyd Garrison. This\r\nlaw was approved by W. Lumpkin, Governor, Dec. 26, 1831. At a meeting of\r\nslave-holders held at Sterling, in the same state, September 4, 1835, it\r\nwas formally recommended to the governor to offer, by proclamation, five\r\nthousand dollars reward for the apprehension of any one of ten persons,\r\ncitizens, with one exception, of New York and Massachusetts, whose names\r\nwere given. The _Milledgeville_ (Ga.) _Federal Union_ of February 1st,\r\n1836, contained an offer of ten thousand dollars for the arrest and\r\nkidnapping of the Rev. A. A. Phelps, of New York. The committee of\r\nvigilance of the parish of East Feliciana offered, in the _Louisville\r\nJournal_ of Oct. 15, 1835, fifty thousand dollars to any person who\r\nwould deliver into their hands Arthur Tappan, of New York. At a public\r\nmeeting at Mount Meigs, Alabama, Aug. 13, 1836, the Hon. Bedford Ginress\r\nin the chair, a reward of fifty thousand dollars was offered for the\r\napprehension of the same Arthur Tappan, or of Le Roy Sunderland, a\r\nMethodist clergyman of New York. Of course, as none of these persons\r\ncould be seized except in violation of the laws of the state where they\r\nwere citizens, this was offering a public reward for an act of felony.\r\nThroughout all the Southern States associations were formed, called\r\ncommittees of vigilance, for the taking of measures for suppressing\r\nabolition opinions, and for the punishment by Lynch law of suspected\r\npersons. At Charleston, South Carolina, a mob of this description forced\r\nopen the post-office, and made a general inspection, at their pleasure,\r\nof its contents; and whatever publication they found there which they\r\nconsidered to be of a dangerous and anti-slavery tendency, they made a\r\npublic bonfire of, in the street. A large public meeting was held, a few\r\ndays afterwards, to complete the preparation for excluding anti-slavery\r\nprinciples from publication, and for ferreting out persons suspected of\r\nabolitionism, that they might be subjected to Lynch law. Similar popular\r\nmeetings were held through the Southern and Western States. At one of\r\nthese, held in Clinton, Mississippi, in the year 1835, the following\r\nresolutions were passed:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That slavery through the South and West is not felt as\r\n  an evil, moral or political, but it is recognized in reference to\r\n  the _actual_, and not to any Utopian condition of our slaves, as a\r\n  blessing both to master and slave.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That it is our decided opinion that any individual who\r\n  dares to circulate, with a view to effectuate the designs of the\r\n  abolitionists, any of the incendiary tracts or newspapers now in a\r\n  course of transmission to this country, is justly worthy, in the\r\n  sight of God and man, of immediate death; and we doubt not that such\r\n  would be the punishment of any such offender in any part of the\r\n  State of Mississippi where he may be found.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the clergy of the State of Mississippi be hereby\r\n  recommended at once to take a stand upon this subject; and that\r\n  their further silence in relation thereto, at this crisis, will, in\r\n  our opinion, be subject to serious censure.\r\n\r\nThe treatment to which persons were exposed, when taken up by any of\r\nthese vigilance committees, as suspected of anti-slavery sentiments, may\r\nbe gathered from the following account. The writer has a distinct\r\nrecollection of the circumstances at the present time, as the victim of\r\nthis injustice was a member of the seminary then under the care of her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n  Amos Dresser, now a missionary in Jamaica, was a theological student\r\n  at Lane Seminary, near Cincinnati. In the vacation (August 1835) he\r\n  undertook to sell Bibles in the State of Tennessee, with a view to\r\n  raise means further to continue his studios. Whilst there, he fell\r\n  under suspicion of being an abolitionist, was arrested by the\r\n  vigilance committee whilst attending a religious meeting in the\r\n  neighborhood of Nashville, the capital of the state, and, after an\r\n  afternoon and evening’s inquisition, condemned to receive twenty\r\n  lashes on his naked body. The sentence was executed on him, between\r\n  eleven and twelve o’clock on Saturday night, in the presence of most\r\n  of the committee, and of an infuriated and blaspheming mob. The\r\n  vigilance committee (an unlawful association) consisted of sixty\r\n  persons. Of these, twenty-seven were members of churches; one, a\r\n  religious teacher; another, the _Elder_ who but a few days before,\r\n  in the Presbyterian church, handed Mr. Dresser the bread and wine at\r\n  the communion of the Lord’s supper.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be seen that the principle involved in such proceedings\r\nas these involves more than the question of slavery. The question was,\r\nin fact, this,—whether it is so important to hold African slaves that it\r\nis proper to deprive free Americans of the liberty of conscience, and\r\nliberty of speech, and liberty of the press, in order to do it. It is\r\neasy to see that very serious changes would be made in the government of\r\na country by the admission of this principle: because it is quite plain\r\nthat, if all these principles of our free government may be given up for\r\none thing, they may for another, and that its ultimate tendency is to\r\ndestroy entirely that freedom of opinion and thought which is considered\r\nto be the distinguishing excellence of American institutions.\r\n\r\nThe question now is, Did the church join with the world in thinking the\r\ninstitution of slavery so important and desirable as to lead them to\r\nlook with approbation upon Lynch law, and the sacrifice of the rights of\r\nfree inquiry? We answer the reader by submitting the following facts and\r\nquotations.\r\n\r\nAt the large meeting which we have described above, in Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, the _Charleston Courier_ informs us “that the clergy of all\r\ndenominations attended in a body, lending their sanction to the\r\nproceedings, and adding by their presence to the impressive character of\r\nthe scene.” There can be no doubt that the presence of the clergy of all\r\ndenominations, in a body, at a meeting held for such a purpose, was an\r\n_impressive scene_, truly!\r\n\r\nAt this meeting it was Resolved,\r\n\r\n  That the thanks of this meeting are due to the reverend gentlemen of\r\n  the clergy in this city, who have so promptly and so effectually\r\n  responded to public sentiment, by suspending their schools in which\r\n  the _free colored population_ were taught; and that this meeting\r\n  deem it a patriotic action, worthy of all praise, and proper to be\r\n  imitated by other teachers of similar schools throughout the state.\r\n\r\nThe question here arises, whether their Lord, at the day of judgment,\r\nwill comment on their actions in a similar strain.\r\n\r\nThe alarm of the Virginia slave-holders was not less; nor were the\r\nclergy in the city of Richmond, the capital, less prompt than the clergy\r\nin Charleston to respond to “public sentiment.” Accordingly, on the 29th\r\nof July, they assembled together, and Resolved, _unanimously_,\r\n\r\n  That we earnestly deprecate the unwarrantable and highly improper\r\n  interference of the people of any other state with the domestic\r\n  relations of master and slave.\r\n\r\n  That the example of our Lord Jesus Christ and his apostles, in not\r\n  interfering with the question of slavery, but uniformly recognizing\r\n  the relations of master and servant, and giving full and\r\n  affectionate instruction to both, is worthy of the imitation of all\r\n  ministers of the gospel.\r\n\r\n  That we will not patronize nor receive any pamphlet or newspaper of\r\n  the anti-slavery societies, and that we will discountenance the\r\n  circulation of all such papers in the community.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. C. Postell, a Methodist minister of South Carolina,\r\nconcludes a very violent letter to the editor of _Zion’s Watchman_, a\r\nMethodist anti-slavery paper published in New York, in the following\r\nmanner. The reader will see that this taunt is an allusion to the offer\r\nof fifty thousand dollars for his body at the South which we have given\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n  But, if you desire to educate the slaves, I will tell you how to\r\n  raise the money without editing _Zion’s Watchman_. You and old\r\n  Arthur Tappan come out to the South this winter, and they will raise\r\n  one hundred thousand dollars for you. New Orleans, itself, will be\r\n  pledged for it. Desiring no further acquaintance with you, and never\r\n  expecting to see you but once in time or eternity, that is at the\r\n  judgment, I subscribe myself the friend of the Bible, and the\r\n  opposer of abolitionists,\r\n\r\n                                                        J. C. POSTELL.\r\n\r\n  _Orangeburgh, July 21st, 1836._\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Thomas S. Witherspoon, a member of the Presbyterian Church,\r\nwriting to the editor of the _Emancipator_, says:\r\n\r\n  I draw my warrant from the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament,\r\n  to hold the slave in bondage. The principle of holding the heathen\r\n  in bondage is recognized by God. * * * When the tardy process of the\r\n  law is too long in redressing our grievances, we of the South have\r\n  adopted the summary remedy of Judge Lynch—and really I think it one\r\n  of the most wholesome and salutary remedies for the malady of\r\n  Northern fanaticism that can be applied, and no doubt my worthy\r\n  friend, the Editor of the _Emancipator and Human Rights_, would feel\r\n  the better of its enforcement, provided he had a Southern\r\n  administrator. I go to the Bible for my warrant in all moral\r\n  matters. * * Let your emissaries dare venture to cross the Potomac,\r\n  and I cannot promise you that their fate will be less than Haman’s.\r\n  Then beware how you goad an insulted but magnanimous people to deeds\r\n  of desperation!\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Robert N. Anderson, also a member of the Presbyterian Church,\r\nsays, in a letter to the Sessions of the Presbyterian Congregations\r\nwithin the bounds of the West Hanover Presbytery:\r\n\r\n  At the approaching stated meeting of our Presbytery, I design to\r\n  offer a preamble and string of resolutions on the subject of the use\r\n  of wine in the Lord’s Supper: and also a preamble and string of\r\n  resolutions on the subject of the treasonable and abominably wicked\r\n  interference of the Northern and Eastern fanatics with our political\r\n  and civil rights, our property and our domestic concerns. You are\r\n  aware that our clergy, whether with or without reason, are more\r\n  suspected by the public than the clergy of other denominations. Now,\r\n  _dear Christian brethren_, I humbly express it as my earnest wish,\r\n  that you _quit yourselves like men_. If there be any stray goat of a\r\n  minister among you, tainted with the bloodhound principles of\r\n  abolitionism, let him be ferreted out, silenced, excommunicated, and\r\n  left to the _public to dispose of him in other respects_.\r\n\r\n                                Your affectionate brother in the Lord,\r\n                                                  ROBERT N. ANDERSON.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. William S. Plummer, D.D., of Richmond, a member of the\r\nOld-school Presbyterian Church, is another instance of the same sort. He\r\nwas absent from Richmond at the time the clergy in that city purged\r\nthemselves, in a body, from the charge of being favorably disposed to\r\nabolition. On his return, he lost no time in communicating to the\r\n“Chairman of the Committee of Correspondence” his agreement with his\r\nclerical brethren. The passages quoted occur in his letter to the\r\nchairman:\r\n\r\n  I have carefully watched this matter from its earliest existence,\r\n  and everything I have seen or heard of its character, both from its\r\n  patrons and its enemies, has confirmed me, beyond repentance, in the\r\n  belief, that, let the character of abolitionists be what it may in\r\n  the sight of the Judge of all the earth, this is the most\r\n  meddlesome, impudent, reckless, fierce, and wicked excitement I ever\r\n  saw.\r\n\r\n  If abolitionists will set the country in a blaze, it is but fair\r\n  that they should receive the first warming at the fire.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Lastly. Abolitionists are like infidels, wholly unaddicted to\r\n  martyrdom for opinion’s sake. Let them understand that _they will be\r\n  caught_ [Lynched] if they come among us, and they will take good\r\n  heed to keep out of our way. There is not one man among them who has\r\n  any more idea of shedding his blood in this cause than he has of\r\n  making war on the Grand Turk.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Hill, of Virginia, said, in the New School Assembly:\r\n\r\n  The abolitionists have made the servitude of the slave harder. If I\r\n  could tell you some of the dirty tricks which these abolitionists\r\n  have played, you would not wonder. Some of them have been Lynched,\r\n  and it served them right.\r\n\r\nThese things sufficiently show the estimate which the Southern clergy\r\nand church have formed and expressed as to the relative value of slavery\r\nand the right of free inquiry. It shows, also, that they consider\r\nslavery as so important that they can tolerate and encourage acts of\r\nlawless violence, and risk all the dangers of encouraging mob law, for\r\nits sake. These passages and considerations sufficiently show the stand\r\nwhich the Southern church takes upon this subject.\r\n\r\nFor many of these opinions, shocking as they may appear, some apology\r\nmay be found in that blinding power of custom and all those deadly\r\neducational influences which always attend the system of slavery, and\r\nwhich must necessarily produce a certain obtuseness of the moral sense\r\nin the mind of any man who is educated from childhood under them.\r\n\r\nThere is also, in the habits of mind formed under a system which is\r\nsupported by continual resort to force and violence, a necessary\r\ndeadening of sensibility to the evils of force and violence, as applied\r\nto other subjects. The whole style of civilization which is formed under\r\nsuch an institution has been not unaptly denominated by a popular writer\r\n“the bowie-knife style;” and we must not be surprised at its producing a\r\npeculiarly martial cast of religious character, and ideas very much at\r\nvariance with the spirit of the gospel. A religious man, born and\r\neducated at the South, has all these difficulties to contend with, in\r\nelevating himself to the true spirit of the gospel.\r\n\r\nIt was said by one that, after the Reformation, the best of men, being\r\neducated under a system of despotism and force, and accustomed from\r\nchildhood to have force, and not argument, made the test of opinion,\r\ncame to look upon all controversies very much in a Smithfield light,—the\r\nquestion being not as to the propriety of burning heretics, but as to\r\nwhich party ought to be burned.\r\n\r\nThe system of slavery is a simple retrogression of society to the worst\r\nabuses of the middle ages. We must not therefore be surprised to find\r\nthe opinions and practices of the middle ages, as to civil and religious\r\ntoleration, prevailing.\r\n\r\nHowever much we may reprobate and deplore those unworthy views of God\r\nand religion which are implied in such declarations as are here\r\nrecorded,—however blasphemous and absurd they may appear,—still, it is\r\napparent that their authors uttered them with sincerity: and this is the\r\nmost melancholy feature of the case. They are as sincere as Paul when he\r\nbreathed out threatenings and slaughter, and when he thought within\r\nhimself that he _ought_ to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus.\r\nThey are as sincere as the Brahmin or Hindoo, conscientiously supporting\r\na religion of cruelty and blood. They are as sincere as many\r\nenlightened, scholarlike and Christian men in modern Europe, who, born\r\nand bred under systems of civil and religious despotism, and having them\r\nentwined with all their dearest associations of home and country, and\r\nhaving all their habits of thought and feeling biased by them, do most\r\nconscientiously defend them.\r\n\r\nThere is something in conscientious conviction, even in case of the\r\nworst kind of opinions, which is not without a certain degree of\r\nrespectability. That the religion expressed by the declarations which we\r\nhave quoted is as truly Antichrist as the religion of the Church of\r\nRome, it is presumed no sensible person out of the sphere of American\r\ninfluences will deny. That there may be very sincere Christians under\r\nthis system of religion, with all its false principles and all its\r\ndisadvantageous influences, liberality must concede. The Church of Rome\r\nhas had its Fenelon, its Thomas â Kempis; and the Southern Church, which\r\nhas adopted these principles, has had men who have risen above the level\r\nof their system. At the time of the Reformation, and now, the Church of\r\nRome had in its bosom thousands of praying, devoted, humble Christians,\r\nwhich, like flowers in the clefts of rocks, could be counted by no eye,\r\nsave God’s alone. And so, amid the rifts and glaciers of this horrible\r\nspiritual and temporal despotism, we hope are blooming flowers of\r\nParadise, patient, prayerful, and self-denying Christians; and it is the\r\ndeepest grief, in attacking the dreadful system under which they have\r\nbeen born and brought up, that violence must be done to their cherished\r\nfeelings and associations. In another and better world, perhaps, they\r\nmay appreciate the motives of those who do this.\r\n\r\nBut now another consideration comes to the mind. These Southern\r\nChristians have been united in ecclesiastical relations with Christians\r\nof the northern and free states, meeting with them, by their\r\nrepresentatives, yearly, in their various ecclesiastical assemblies. One\r\nmight hope, in case of such a union, that those debasing views of\r\nChristianity, and that deadness of public sentiment, which were the\r\ninevitable result of an education under the slave system, might have\r\nbeen qualified by intercourse with Christians in free states, who,\r\nhaving grown up under free institutions, would naturally be supposed to\r\nfeel the utmost abhorrence of such sentiments. One would have supposed\r\nthat the church and clergy of the free states would naturally have used\r\nthe most strenuous endeavors, by all the means in their power, to\r\nconvince their brethren of errors so dishonorable to Christianity, and\r\ntending to such dreadful practical results. One would have supposed\r\nalso, that, failing to convince their brethren, they would have felt it\r\ndue to Christianity to clear themselves from all complicity with these\r\nsentiments, by the most solemn, earnest and reiterated protests.\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire what has, in fact, been the course of the Northern\r\nchurch on this subject.\r\n\r\nPrevious to making this inquiry, let us review the declarations that\r\nhave been made in the Southern church, and see what principles have been\r\nestablished by them.\r\n\r\n1. That slavery is an innocent and lawful relation, as much as that of\r\nparent and child, husband and wife, or any other lawful relation of\r\nsociety. (Harmony Pres., S. C.)\r\n\r\n2. That it is consistent with the most fraternal regard for the good of\r\nthe slave. (Charleston Union Pres., S. C.)\r\n\r\n3. That masters ought not to be disciplined for selling slaves without\r\ntheir consent. (New-school Pres. Church, Petersburg, Va.)\r\n\r\n4. That the right to buy, sell, and hold men for purposes of gain, was\r\ngiven by express permission of God. (James Smylie and his Presbyteries.)\r\n\r\n5. That the laws which forbid the education of the slave are right, and\r\nmeet the approbation of the reflecting part of the Christian community.\r\n(Ibid.)\r\n\r\n6. That the fact of slavery is not a question of morals at all, but is\r\npurely one of political economy. (Charleston Baptist Association.)\r\n\r\n7. The right of masters to dispose of the time of their slaves has been\r\ndistinctly recognized by the Creator of all things. (Ibid.)\r\n\r\n8. That slavery, as it exists in these United States, is not a moral\r\nevil. (Georgia Conference, Methodist.)\r\n\r\n9. That, without a new revelation from heaven, no man is entitled to\r\npronounce slavery wrong.\r\n\r\n10. That the separation of slaves by sale should be regarded as\r\nseparation by death, and the parties allowed to marry again. (Shiloh\r\nBaptist Ass., and Savannah River Ass.)\r\n\r\n11. That the testimony of colored members of the churches shall not be\r\ntaken against a white person. (Methodist Church.)\r\n\r\nIn addition, it has been plainly avowed, by the expressed principles and\r\npractice of Christians of various denominations, that they regard it\r\nright and proper to put down all inquiry upon this subject by Lynch law.\r\n\r\nOne would have imagined that these principles were sufficiently\r\nextraordinary, as coming from the professors of the religion of Christ,\r\nto have excited a good deal of attention in their Northern brethren. It\r\nalso must be seen that, as principles, they are principles of very\r\nextensive application, underlying the whole foundations of religion and\r\nmorality. If not true, they were certainly heresies of no ordinary\r\nmagnitude, involving no ordinary results. Let us now return to our\r\ninquiry as to the course of the Northern church in relation to them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  Birney’s pamphlet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first place, have any of these opinions ever been treated in the\r\nchurch as heresies, and the teachers of them been subjected to the\r\ncensures with which it is thought proper to visit heresy?\r\n\r\nAfter a somewhat extended examination upon the subject, the writer has\r\nbeen able to discover but one instance of this sort. It may be possible\r\nthat such cases have existed in other denominations, which have escaped\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nA clergyman in the Cincinnati N. S. Presbytery maintained the doctrine\r\nthat slaveholding was justified by the Bible, and for persistence in\r\nteaching this sentiment was suspended by that presbytery. He appealed to\r\nSynod, and the decision was confirmed by the Cincinnati Synod. The New\r\nSchool General Assembly, however, reversed this decision of the\r\npresbytery, and restored the standing of the clergyman. The presbytery,\r\non its part, refused to receive him back, and he was received into the\r\nOld School Church.\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian Church has probably exceeded all other churches of the\r\nUnited States in its zeal for doctrinal opinions. This church has been\r\nshaken and agitated to its very foundation with questions of heresy;\r\nbut, except in this individual case, it is not known that any of these\r\nprinciples which have been asserted by Southern Presbyterian bodies and\r\nindividuals have ever been discussed in its General Assembly as matters\r\nof heresy.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Smylie’s pamphlet came out, the Presbyterian Church\r\nwas convulsed with the trial of the Rev. Albert Barnes for certain\r\nalleged heresies. These heresies related to the federal headship of\r\nAdam, the propriety of imputing his sin to all his posterity, and the\r\nquestion whether men have any ability of any kind to obey the\r\ncommandments of God.\r\n\r\nFor advancing certain sentiments on these topics, Mr. Barnes was\r\nsilenced by the vote of the synod to which he belonged, and his trial in\r\nthe General Assembly on these points was the all-engrossing topic in the\r\nPresbyterian Church for some time. The Rev. Dr. L. Beecher went through\r\na trial with reference to similar opinions. During all this time, no\r\nnotice was taken of the heresy, if such it be, that the right to buy,\r\nsell, and hold men for purposes of gain, was expressly given by God;\r\nalthough that heresy was publicly promulgated in the same Presbyterian\r\nChurch, by Mr. Smylie, and the presbyteries with which he was connected.\r\n\r\nIf it be accounted for by saying that the question of slavery is a\r\nquestion of _practical morals_, and not of dogmatic theology, we are\r\nthen reminded that questions of morals of far less magnitude have been\r\ndiscussed with absorbing interest.\r\n\r\nThe Old School Presbyterian Church, in whose communion the greater part\r\nof the slave-holding Presbyterians of the South are found, has never\r\nfelt called upon to discipline its members for upholding a system which\r\ndenies legal marriage to all slaves. Yet this church was agitated to its\r\nvery foundation by the discussion of a question of morals which an\r\nimpartial observer would probably consider of far less magnitude,\r\nnamely, whether a man might lawfully marry his deceased wife’s sister.\r\nFor the time, all the strength and attention of the church seemed\r\nconcentrated upon this important subject. The trial went from Presbytery\r\nto Synod, and from Synod to General Assembly; and ended with deposing a\r\nvery respectable minister for this crime.\r\n\r\nRev. Robert P. Breckenridge, D.D., a member of the Old School Assembly,\r\nhas thus described the state of the slave population as to their\r\nmarriage relations: “The system of slavery denies to a whole class of\r\nhuman beings the sacredness of marriage and of home, compelling them to\r\nlive in a state of concubinage; for in the eye of the law no colored\r\nslave-man is the husband of any wife in particular, nor any slave-woman\r\nthe wife of any husband in particular; no slave-man is the father of any\r\nchildren in particular, and no slave-child is the child of any parent in\r\nparticular.”\r\n\r\nNow, had this church considered the fact that three million men and\r\nwomen were, by the laws of the land, obliged to live in this manner, as\r\nof equally serious consequence, it is evident, from the ingenuity,\r\nargument, vehemence, Biblical research, and untiring zeal, which they\r\nbestowed on Mr. McQueen’s trial, that they could have made a very strong\r\ncase with regard to this also.\r\n\r\nThe history of the united action of denominations which included\r\nchurches both in the slave and free states is a melancholy\r\nexemplification, to a reflecting mind, of that gradual deterioration of\r\nthe moral sense which results from admitting any compromise, however\r\nslight, with an acknowledged sin. The best minds in the world cannot\r\nbear such a familiarity without injury to the moral sense. The facts of\r\nthe slave system and of the slave laws, when presented to disinterested\r\njudges in Europe, have excited a universal outburst of horror; yet, in\r\nassemblies composed of the wisest and best clergymen of America, these\r\nthings have been discussed from year to year, and yet brought no results\r\nthat have, in the slightest degree, lessened the evil. The reason is\r\nthis. A portion of the members of these bodies had pledged themselves to\r\nsustain the system, and peremptorily to refuse and put down all\r\ndiscussion of it; and the other part of the body did not consider this\r\nstand so taken as being of sufficiently vital consequence to authorize\r\nseparation.\r\n\r\nNobody will doubt that, had the Southern members taken such a stand\r\nagainst the divinity of our Lord, the division would have been immediate\r\nand unanimous; but yet the Southern members do maintain the right to buy\r\nand sell, lease, hire and mortgage, multitudes of men and women, whom,\r\nwith the same breath, they declared to be members of their churches and\r\ntrue Christians. The Bible declares of all such that they are temples of\r\nthe Holy Ghost; that they are members of Christ’s body, of his flesh and\r\nbones. Is not the doctrine that men may lawfully sell the members of\r\nChrist, his body, his flesh and bones, for purposes of gain, as really a\r\nheresy as the denial of the divinity of Christ; and is it not a dishonor\r\nto Him who is over all, God blessed forever, to tolerate this dreadful\r\nopinion, with its more dreadful consequences, while the smallest\r\nheresies concerning the imputation of Adam’s sin are pursued with eager\r\nvehemence? If the history of the action of all the bodies thus united\r\ncan be traced downwards, we shall find that, by reason of this tolerance\r\nof an admitted sin, the anti-slavery testimony has every year grown\r\nweaker and weaker. If we look over the history of all denominations, we\r\nshall see that at first they used very stringent language with relation\r\nto slavery. This is particularly the case with the Methodist and\r\nPresbyterian bodies, and for that reason we select these two as\r\nexamples. The Methodist Society especially, as organized by John Wesley,\r\nwas an anti-slavery society, and the Book of Discipline contained the\r\nmost positive statutes against slave-holding. The history of the\r\nsuccessive resolutions of the conference of this church is very\r\nstriking. In 1780, before the church was regularly organized in the\r\nUnited States, they resolved as follows:\r\n\r\n  The conference acknowledges that slavery is contrary to the laws of\r\n  God, man and nature, and hurtful to society; contrary to the\r\n  dictates of conscience and true religion; and doing what we would\r\n  not others should do unto us.\r\n\r\nIn 1784, when the church was fully organized, rules were adopted\r\nprescribing the times at which members who were already slave-holders\r\nshould emancipate their slaves. These rules were succeeded by the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  Every person concerned, who will not comply with these rules, shall\r\n  have liberty quietly to withdraw from our society within the twelve\r\n  months following the notice being given him, as aforesaid; otherwise\r\n  the assistants shall exclude him from the society.\r\n\r\n  No person holding slaves shall in future be admitted into society,\r\n  or to the Lord’s Supper, till he previously comply with these rules\r\n  concerning slavery.\r\n\r\n  Those who buy, sell, or give [slaves] away, unless on purpose to\r\n  free them, shall be expelled immediately.\r\n\r\nIn 1801:\r\n\r\n  We declare that we are more than ever convinced of the great evil of\r\n  African slavery, which still exists in these United States.\r\n\r\n  Every member of the society who sells a slave shall, immediately\r\n  after full proof, be excluded from the society, &c.\r\n\r\n  The Annual Conferences are directed to draw up addresses, for the\r\n  gradual emancipation of the slaves, to the legislature. Proper\r\n  committees shall be appointed by the Annual Conferences, out of the\r\n  most respectable of our friends, for the conducting of the business;\r\n  and the presiding elders, deacons, and travelling preachers, shall\r\n  procure as many proper signatures as possible to the addresses; and\r\n  give all the assistance in their power, in every respect, to aid the\r\n  committees, and to further the blessed undertaking. Let this be\r\n  continued from year to year, till the desired end be accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 let us notice the change. The General Conference held its annual\r\nsession in Cincinnati, and resolved as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, By the delegates of the Annual Conferences in General\r\n  Conference assembled, That they are decidedly opposed to modern\r\n  abolitionism, and _wholly disclaim any right, wish, or intention_,\r\n  to interfere in the civil and political relation between master and\r\n  slave, as it exists in the slave-holding states of this Union.\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were passed by a very large majority. An address was\r\nreceived from the Wesleyan Methodist Conference in England,\r\naffectionately remonstrating on the subject of slavery. The Conference\r\nrefused to publish it. In the pastoral address to the churches are these\r\npassages:\r\n\r\n  It cannot be unknown to you that the question of slavery in the\r\n  United States, by the constitutional compact which binds us together\r\n  as a nation, is left to be regulated by the several state\r\n  legislatures themselves; and thereby is put beyond the control of\r\n  the general government, as well as that of all ecclesiastical\r\n  bodies; it being manifest that in the slave-holding states\r\n  themselves the entire responsibility of its existence, or\r\n  non-existence, rests with those state legislatures. * * * * These\r\n  facts, which are only mentioned here as a reason for the friendly\r\n  admonition which we wish to give you, constrain us, as your pastors,\r\n  who are called to watch over your souls as they must give account,\r\n  to exhort you to abstain from all abolition movements and\r\n  associations, and to refrain from patronizing any of their\r\n  publications, &c. * *\r\n\r\nThe subordinate conferences showed the same spirit.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 the New York Annual Conference resolved that no one should be\r\nelected a deacon or elder in the church, unless he would give a pledge\r\nto the church that he would refrain from discussing this subject.[25]\r\n\r\nIn 1838 the conference resolved:\r\n\r\n  As the sense of this conference, that any of its members, or\r\n  probationers, who shall patronize _Zion’s Watchman_, either by\r\n  writing in commendation of its character, by circulating it,\r\n  recommending it to our people, or procuring subscribers, or by\r\n  collecting or remitting moneys, shall be deemed guilty of\r\n  indiscretion, and dealt with accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that _Zion’s Watchman_ was edited by Le Roy\r\nSunderland, for whose abduction the State of Alabama had offered fifty\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, the General Conference at Baltimore passed the resolution that\r\nwe have already quoted, forbidding preachers to allow colored persons to\r\ngive testimony in their churches. It has been computed that about eighty\r\nthousand people were deprived of the right of testimony by this act.\r\nThis Methodist Church subsequently broke into a Northern and Southern\r\nConference. The Southern Conference is avowedly all pro-slavery, and the\r\nNorthern Conference has still in its communion slave-holding conferences\r\nand members.\r\n\r\nOf the Northern conferences, one of the largest, the Baltimore, passed\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That this conference disclaims having any fellowship\r\n  with abolitionism. On the contrary, while it is determined to\r\n  maintain its well-known and long-established position, by keeping\r\n  the travelling preachers composing its own body free from slavery,\r\n  it is also determined not to hold connection with any ecclesiastical\r\n  body that shall make non-slaveholding a condition of membership in\r\n  the church; but to stand by and maintain the discipline as it is.\r\n\r\nThe following extract is made from an address of the Philadelphia Annual\r\nConference to the societies under its care, dated Wilmington Del., April\r\n7, 1847:\r\n\r\n  If the plan of separation gives us the pastoral care of you, it\r\n  remains to inquire whether we have done anything, as a conference,\r\n  or as men, to forfeit your confidence and affection. We are not\r\n  advised that even in the great excitement which has distressed you\r\n  for some months past, any one has impeached our moral conduct, or\r\n  charged us with unsoundness in doctrine, or corruption or tyranny in\r\n  the administration of discipline. But we learn that the simple cause\r\n  of the unhappy excitement among you is, that some suspect us, or\r\n  affect to suspect us, of being abolitionists. Yet no particular act\r\n  of the conference, or any particular member thereof, is adduced, as\r\n  the ground of the erroneous and injurious suspicion. We would ask\r\n  you, brethren, whether the conduct of our ministry among you for\r\n  sixty years past ought not to be sufficient to protect us from this\r\n  charge. Whether the question we have been accustomed, for a few\r\n  years past, to put to candidates for admission among us, namely,\r\n  _Are you an abolitionist?_ and, without each one answered in the\r\n  negative, he was not received, ought not to protect us from the\r\n  charge. Whether the action of the last conference on this particular\r\n  matter ought not to satisfy any fair and candid mind that we are\r\n  not, and do not desire to be, abolitionists. * * * We cannot see how\r\n  we can be regarded as abolitionists, without the ministers of the\r\n  Methodist Episcopal Church South being considered in the same light.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Wishing you all heavenly benedictions, we are, dear brethren, yours,\r\n  in Christ Jesus,\r\n\r\n                        J. P. DURBIN,    }\r\n                        J. KENNADAY,     }\r\n                     IGNATIUS T. COOPER, } _Comm._\r\n                     WILLIAM H. GILDER,  }\r\n                       JOSEPH CASTLE,    }\r\n\r\nThese facts sufficiently define the position of the Methodist Church.\r\nThe history is melancholy, but instructive. The history of the\r\nPresbyterian Church is also of interest.\r\n\r\nIn 1793, the following note to the eighth commandment was inserted in\r\nthe Book of Discipline, as expressing the doctrine of the church upon\r\nslave-holding:\r\n\r\n  1 Tim. 1:10. The law is made for MAN-STEALERS. This crime among the\r\n  Jews exposed the perpetrators of it to capital punishment, Exodus\r\n  21:15; and the apostle here classes them with sinners of the first\r\n  rank. The word he uses, in its original import, comprehends all who\r\n  are concerned in bringing any of the human race into slavery, or _in\r\n  retaining them in it_. _Hominum fures, qui servos vel liberos\r\n  abducunt, retinent, vendunt, vel emunt._ Stealers of men are all\r\n  those who bring off slaves or freemen, and KEEP, SELL, or BUY THEM.\r\n  To steal a free man, says Grotius, is the highest kind of theft. In\r\n  other instances, we only steal human property; but when we steal or\r\n  retain men in slavery, we seize those who, in common with ourselves,\r\n  are constituted by the original grant lords of the earth.\r\n\r\nNo rules of church discipline were enforced, and members whom this\r\npassage declared guilty of this crime remained undisturbed in its\r\ncommunion, as ministers and elders. This inconsistency was obviated in\r\n1816 by expunging the passage from the Book of Discipline. In 1818 it\r\nadopted an expression of its views on slavery. This document is a long\r\none, conceived and written in a very Christian spirit. The Assembly’s\r\nDigest says, p. 341, that it was _unanimously_ adopted. The following is\r\nits testimony as to the nature of slavery:\r\n\r\n  We consider the voluntary enslaving of one part of the human race by\r\n  another as a gross violation of the most precious and sacred rights\r\n  of human nature: as utterly inconsistent with the law of God, which\r\n  requires us to love our neighbor as ourselves; and as totally\r\n  irreconcilable with the spirit and principles of the gospel of\r\n  Christ, which enjoin that “all things whatsoever ye would that men\r\n  should do to you, do ye even so to them.” Slavery creates a paradox\r\n  in the moral system—it exhibits rational, accountable, and immortal\r\n  beings in such circumstances as scarcely to leave them the power of\r\n  moral action. It exhibits them as dependent on the will of others,\r\n  whether they shall receive religious instruction; whether they shall\r\n  know and worship the true God; whether they shall enjoy the\r\n  ordinances of the gospel; whether they shall perform the duties and\r\n  cherish the endearments of husbands and wives, parents and children,\r\n  neighbors and friends; whether they shall preserve their chastity\r\n  and purity, or regard the dictates of justice and humanity. Such are\r\n  some of the consequences of slavery,—consequences not imaginary, but\r\n  which connect themselves with its very existence. The evils to which\r\n  the slave is _always_ exposed often take place in fact, and in their\r\n  very worst degree and form: and where all of them do not take\r\n  place,—as we rejoice to say that in many instances, through the\r\n  influence of the principles of humanity and religion on the minds of\r\n  masters, they do not,—still the slave is deprived of his natural\r\n  right, degraded as a human being, and exposed to the danger of\r\n  passing into the hands of a master who may inflict upon him all the\r\n  hardships and injuries which inhumanity and avarice may suggest.\r\n\r\nThis language was surely decided, and it was _unanimously_ adopted by\r\nslave-holders and non-slaveholders. Certainly one might think the time\r\nof redemption was drawing nigh. The declaration goes on to say:\r\n\r\n  It is manifestly the duty of all Christians who enjoy the light of\r\n  the present day, when the inconsistency of slavery both with the\r\n  dictates of humanity and religion has been demonstrated and is\r\n  _generally seen and acknowledged_, to use honest, earnest, unwearied\r\n  endeavors to correct the errors of former times, and as speedily as\r\n  possible to efface this blot on our holy religion, and to OBTAIN THE\r\n  COMPLETE ABOLITION of slavery throughout Christendom and throughout\r\n  the world.\r\n\r\nHere we have the Presbyterian Church, slave-holding and\r\nnon-slaveholding, virtually formed into one great _abolition society_,\r\nas we have seen the Methodist was.\r\n\r\nThe assembly then goes on to state that the slaves are not _at present_\r\nprepared to be free,—that they tenderly sympathize with the portion of\r\nthe church and country that has had this evil entailed upon them, where\r\nas they say “a great and the most virtuous part of the community ABHOR\r\nSLAVERY and wish ITS EXTERMINATION.” But they exhort them to commence\r\nimmediately the work of instructing slaves, with a view to preparing\r\nthem for freedom; and to let no greater delay take place than “a regard\r\nto public welfare _indispensably_ demands.” “To be governed by no other\r\nconsiderations than an _honest and impartial regard to the happiness of\r\nthe injured party, uninfluenced by the expense and inconvenience_ which\r\nsuch regard may involve.” It warns against “_unduly extending this plea\r\nof necessity_,” against making it a cover for the _love and practice of\r\nslavery_. It ends by recommending that any one who shall sell a\r\nfellow-Christian without his consent be immediately disciplined and\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nIf we consider that this was _unanimously_ adopted by slave-holders and\r\nall, and grant, as we certainly do, that it was adopted in all honesty\r\nand good faith, we shall surely expect something from it. We should\r\nexpect forthwith the organizing of a set of common schools for the\r\nslave-children; for an efficient religious ministration; for an entire\r\ndiscontinuance of trading in Christian slaves; for laws which make the\r\nfamily relations sacred. Was any such thing done or attempted? Alas! Two\r\nyears after this came the ADMISSION OF MISSOURI, and the increase of\r\ndemand in the southern slave-market and the internal slave-trade.\r\nInstead of schoolteachers, they had slave-traders; instead of gathering\r\n_schools_, they gathered _slave-coffles_; instead of building\r\nschool-houses, they built slave-pens and slave-prisons, jails,\r\nbarracoons, factories, or whatever the trade pleases to term them; and\r\nso went the plan of gradual emancipation.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, sixteen years after, a committee of the Synod of Kentucky, in\r\nwhich state slavery is generally said to exist in its mildest form,\r\nappointed to make a report on the condition of the slaves, gave the\r\nfollowing picture of their condition. First, as to their spiritual\r\ncondition, they say:\r\n\r\n  After making all reasonable allowances, our colored population can\r\n  be considered, at the most, but semi-heathen. As to their temporal\r\n  estate—Brutal stripes, and all the various kinds of personal\r\n  indignities, are not the only species of cruelty which slavery\r\n  licenses. The law does not recognize the family relations of the\r\n  slave, and extends to him no protection in the enjoyment of domestic\r\n  endearments. The members of a slave-family may be forcibly\r\n  separated, so that they shall never more meet until the final\r\n  judgment. And cupidity often induces the masters to practise what\r\n  the law allows. Brothers and sisters, parents and children, husbands\r\n  and wives, are torn asunder, and permitted to see each other no\r\n  more. _These acts are daily occurring in the midst of us._ The\r\n  shrieks and the agony often witnessed on such occasions proclaim\r\n  with a trumpet-tongue the iniquity and cruelty of our system. The\r\n  cries of these sufferers go up to the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.\r\n  _There is not a neighborhood where these heart-rending scenes are\r\n  not displayed._ There is not a village or road that does not behold\r\n  the sad procession of manacled outcasts, whose chains and mournful\r\n  countenances tell that they are exiled by force from all that their\r\n  hearts hold dear. Our church, years ago, raised its voice of solemn\r\n  warning against this flagrant violation of every principle of mercy,\r\n  justice, and humanity. Yet we blush to announce to you and to the\r\n  world that this warning has been often disregarded, even by those\r\n  who hold to our communion. _Cases have occurred, in our own\r\n  denomination, where professors of the religion of mercy have torn\r\n  the mother from her children, and sent her into a merciless and\r\n  returnless exile._ Yet acts of discipline have rarely followed such\r\n  conduct.\r\n\r\nHon. James G. Birney, for years a resident of Kentucky, in his pamphlet,\r\namends the word _rarely_ by substituting _never_. What could show more\r\nplainly the utter inefficiency of the past act of the Assembly, and the\r\nnecessity of adopting some measures more efficient? In 1835, therefore,\r\nthe subject was urged upon the General Assembly, entreating them to\r\ncarry out the principles and designs they had avowed in 1818.\r\n\r\nMr. Stuart, of Illinois, in a speech he made upon the subject, said:\r\n\r\n  I hope this assembly are prepared to come out fully and declare\r\n  their sentiments, that slave-holding is a most flagrant and heinous\r\n  SIN. Let us not pass it by in this indirect way, while so many\r\n  thousands and tens of thousands of our fellow-creatures are writhing\r\n  under the lash, often inflicted, too, by ministers and elders of the\r\n  Presbyterian Church.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  In this church a man may take a free-born child, force it away from\r\n  its parents, to whom God gave it in charge, saying “Bring it up for\r\n  me,” and sell it as a beast or hold it in perpetual bondage, and not\r\n  only escape corporeal punishment, but really be esteemed an\r\n  excellent Christian. Nay, even ministers of the gospel and doctors\r\n  of divinity may engage in this unholy traffic, and yet sustain their\r\n  high and holy calling.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Elders, ministers, and doctors of divinity, are, with both hands,\r\n  engaged in the practice.\r\n\r\nOne would have thought facts like these, stated in a body of Christians,\r\nwere enough to wake the dead; but, alas! we can become accustomed to\r\nvery awful things. No action was taken upon these remonstrances, except\r\nto refer them to a committee, to be reported on at the next session, in\r\n1836.\r\n\r\nThe moderator of the assembly in 1836 was a slave-holder, Dr. T. S.\r\nWitherspoon, the same who said to the editor of the _Emancipator_, “I\r\ndraw my warrant from the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to hold\r\nmy slaves in bondage. The principle of holding the heathen in bondage is\r\nrecognized by God. When the tardy process of the law is too long in\r\nredressing our grievances, we at the South have adopted the summary\r\nprocess of Judge Lynch.”\r\n\r\nThe majority of the committee appointed made a report as follows:\r\n\r\n  Whereas the subject of slavery is inseparably connected with the\r\n  laws of many of the states in this Union, with which it is by no\r\n  means proper for an ecclesiastical judicature to interfere, and\r\n  involves many considerations in regard to which great diversity of\r\n  opinion and intensity of feeling are known to exist in the churches\r\n  represented in this Assembly; And whereas there is great reason to\r\n  believe that any action on the part of this Assembly, in reference\r\n  to this subject, would tend to distract and divide our churches, and\r\n  would probably in no wise promote the benefit of those whose welfare\r\n  is immediately contemplated in the memorials in question.\r\n\r\n  Therefore, _Resolved_,\r\n\r\n  1. That it is not expedient for the Assembly to take any further\r\n  order in relation to this subject.\r\n\r\n  2. That as the _notes_ which have been expunged from our public\r\n  formularies, and which some of the memorials referred to the\r\n  committee request to have restored, were introduced irregularly,\r\n  never had the sanction of the church, and therefore never possessed\r\n  any authority, the General Assembly has no power, nor would they\r\n  think it expedient, to assign them a place in the authorized\r\n  standards of the church.\r\n\r\nThe minority of the committee, the Rev. Messrs. Dickey and Beman,\r\nreported as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_,\r\n\r\n  1. That the buying, selling, or holding a human being as property,\r\n  is in the sight of God a heinous sin, and ought to subject the doer\r\n  of it to the censures of the church.\r\n\r\n  2. That it is the duty of every one, and especially of every\r\n  Christian, who may be involved in this sin, to free himself from its\r\n  entanglement without delay.\r\n\r\n  3. That it is the duty of every one, especially of every Christian,\r\n  in the meekness and firmness of the gospel to plead the cause of the\r\n  poor and needy, by testifying against the principle and practice of\r\n  slave-holding; and to use his best endeavors to deliver the church\r\n  of God from the evil; and to bring about the emancipation of the\r\n  slaves in these United States, and throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe slave-holding delegates, to the number of forty-eight, met _apart_,\r\nand _Resolved_,\r\n\r\n  That if the General Assembly shall undertake to exercise authority\r\n  on the subject of slavery, so as to make it an immorality, or shall\r\n  in any way declare that Christians are criminal in holding slaves,\r\n  that a declaration shall be presented by the Southern delegation\r\n  declining their jurisdiction in the case, and our determination not\r\n  to submit to such decision.\r\n\r\nIn view of these conflicting reports, the Assembly resolved as follows:\r\n\r\n  Inasmuch as the constitution of the Presbyterian Church, in its\r\n  preliminary and fundamental principles, declares that no church\r\n  judicatories ought to pretend to make laws to bind the conscience\r\n  _in virtue of their own authority_; and as the urgency of the\r\n  business of the Assembly, and the shortness of the time during which\r\n  they can continue in session, render it impossible to deliberate and\r\n  decide judiciously on the subject of slavery in its relation to the\r\n  church; therefore, _Resolved_, That this whole subject be\r\n  indefinitely postponed.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the slave-trade at the time when the General Assembly\r\nrefused to act upon the subject of slavery at all, may be inferred from\r\nthe following items. The _Virginia Times_, in an article published in\r\nthis very year of 1836, estimated the number of slaves exported for sale\r\nfrom that state alone, during the twelve months preceding, at forty\r\nthousand. The _Natchez_ (Miss.) _Courier_ says that in the same year the\r\nStates of Alabama, Missouri and Arkansas, received two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand slaves from the more northern states. If we deduct from these\r\nall who may be supposed to have emigrated with their masters, still what\r\nan immense trade is here indicated!\r\n\r\nThe Rev. James H. Dickey, who moved the resolutions above presented, had\r\nseen some sights which would naturally incline him to wish the Assembly\r\nto take some action on the subject, as appears from the following\r\naccount of a slave-coffle, from his pen.\r\n\r\n  In the summer of 1822, as I returned with my family from a visit\r\n  to the Barrens of Kentucky, I witnessed a scene such as I never\r\n  witnessed before, and such as I hope never to witness again.\r\n  Having passed through Paris, in Bourbon county, Ky., the sound of\r\n  music (beyond a little rising ground) attracted my attention. I\r\n  looked forward, and saw the flag of my country waving. Supposing\r\n  that I was about to meet a military parade, I drove hastily to the\r\n  side of the road; and, having gained the ascent, I discovered (I\r\n  suppose) about forty black men all chained together after the\r\n  following manner: each of them was handcuffed, and they were\r\n  arranged in rank and file. A chain perhaps forty feet long, the\r\n  size of a fifth-horse-chain, was stretched between the two ranks,\r\n  to which short chains were joined, which connected with the\r\n  handcuffs. Behind them were, I suppose, about thirty women, in\r\n  double rank, the couples tied hand to hand. A solemn sadness sat\r\n  on every countenance, and the dismal silence of this march of\r\n  despair was interrupted only by the sound of two violins; yes, as\r\n  if to add insult to injury, the foremost couple were furnished\r\n  with a violin apiece; the second couple were ornamented with\r\n  cockades, while near the centre waved the republican flag, carried\r\n  by a hand _literally in chains_. I could not forbear exclaiming to\r\n  the lordly driver who rode at his ease along-side, “Heaven will\r\n  curse that man who engages in such traffic, and the government\r\n  that protects him in it!” I pursued my journey till evening, and\r\n  put up for the night, when I mentioned the scene I had witnessed.\r\n  “Ah!” cried my landlady, “that is my brother!” From her I learned\r\n  that his name is Stone, of Bourbon county, Kentucky, in\r\n  partnership with one Kinningham, of Paris; and that a few days\r\n  before he had purchased a negro-woman from a man in Nicholas\r\n  county. She refused to go with him; he attempted to compel her,\r\n  but she defended herself. Without further ceremony, he stepped\r\n  back, and, by a blow on the side of her head with the butt of his\r\n  whip, brought her to the ground; he tied her, and drove her off. I\r\n  learned further, that besides the drove I had seen, there were\r\n  about thirty shut up in the Paris prison for safe-keeping, to be\r\n  added to the company, and that they were designed for the Orleans\r\n  market. And to this they are doomed for no other crime than that\r\n  of a black skin and curled locks. Shall I not visit for these\r\n  things? saith the Lord. Shall not my soul be avenged on such a\r\n  nation as this?\r\n\r\nIt cannot be possible that these Christian men realized these things,\r\nor, at most, they realized them just as we realize the most tremendous\r\ntruths of religion, dimly and feebly.\r\n\r\nTwo years after, the General Assembly, by a sudden and very unexpected\r\nmovement, passed a vote exscinding, without trial, from the communion of\r\nthe church, four synods, comprising the most active and decided\r\nanti-slavery portions of the church. The reasons alleged were, doctrinal\r\ndifferences and ecclesiastical practices inconsistent with\r\nPresbyterianism. By this act about five hundred ministers and sixty\r\nthousand members were cut off from the Presbyterian Church.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the Presbyterian Church called New School, considering\r\nthis act unjust, refused to assent to it, joined the exscinded synods,\r\nand formed themselves into the New School General Assembly. In this\r\ncommunion only three slave-holding presbyteries remained. In the old\r\nthere were between thirty and forty.\r\n\r\nThe course of the Old School Assembly, after the separation, in relation\r\nto the subject of slavery, may be best expressed by quoting one of their\r\nresolutions, passed in 1845. Having some decided anti-slavery members in\r\nits body, and being, moreover, addressed on the subject of slavery by\r\nassociated bodies, they presented, on this year, the following\r\ndeliberate statement of their policy. (Minutes for 1845, p. 18.)\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, 1st. That the General Assembly of the Presbyterian\r\n  Church in the United States was originally organized, and has since\r\n  continued the bond of union in the church, upon the _conceded\r\n  principle that the existence of domestic slavery, under the\r\n  circumstances in which it is found in the Southern portion of the\r\n  country, is no bar to Christian communion_.\r\n\r\n  2. That the petitions that ask the Assembly to make the holding of\r\n  slaves in itself a matter of discipline do virtually require this\r\n  judicatory to _dissolve itself_, and _abandon the organization_\r\n  under which, by the divine blessing, it has so long prospered. The\r\n  tendency is evidently to separate the Northern from the Southern\r\n  portion of the church,—a result which every good Christian must\r\n  deplore, as tending to the dissolution of the Union of our beloved\r\n  country, and which every enlightened Christian will oppose, as\r\n  bringing about a ruinous and unnecessary schism between brethren who\r\n  maintain a common faith.\r\n\r\n  _Yeas, Ministers and Elders, 168._\r\n  _Nays, Ministers and Elders, 13._\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add a comment to this very explicit\r\ndeclaration. It is the plainest possible disclaimer of any protest\r\nagainst slavery; the plainest possible statement that the existence of\r\nthe ecclesiastical organization is of more importance than all the moral\r\nand social considerations which are involved in a full defence and\r\npractice of American slavery.\r\n\r\nThe next year a large number of petitions and remonstrances were\r\npresented, requesting the Assembly to utter additional testimony against\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the petitions, the General Assembly reäffirmed all their\r\nformer testimonies on the subject of slavery for sixty years back, and\r\nalso affirmed that the previous year’s declaration must not be\r\nunderstood as a retraction of that testimony; in other words, they\r\nexpressed it as their opinion, in the words of 1818, that slavery is\r\n“WHOLLY OPPOSED TO THE LAW OF GOD,” and “TOTALLY IRRECONCILABLE WITH THE\r\nPRECEPTS OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST;” and yet that they “had formed their\r\nchurch organization upon the _conceded principle_ that the existence of\r\nit, under the circumstances in which it is found in the Southern States\r\nof the Union, is no bar to Christian communion.”\r\n\r\nSome members protested against this action. (Minutes, 1846. Overture No.\r\n17.)\r\n\r\nGreat hopes were at first entertained of the New School body. As a body,\r\nit was composed mostly of anti-slavery men. It had in it those synods\r\nwhose anti-slavery opinions and actions had been, to say the least, one\r\nvery efficient cause for their excision from the church. It had only\r\nthree slave-holding presbyteries. The power was all in its own hands.\r\nNow, if ever, was their time to cut this loathsome incumbrance wholly\r\nadrift, and stand up, in this age of concession and conformity to the\r\nworld, a purely protesting church, free from all complicity with this\r\nmost dreadful national immorality.\r\n\r\nOn the first session of the General Assembly, this course was most\r\nvehemently urged, by many petitions and memorials. These memorials were\r\nreferred to a committee of decided anti-slavery men. The argument on one\r\nside was, that the time was now come to take decided measures to cut\r\nfree wholly from all pro-slavery complicity, and avow their principles\r\nwith decision, even though it should repel all such churches from their\r\ncommunion as were not prepared for immediate emancipation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the majority of the committee were urged by opposing\r\nconsiderations. The brethren from slave states made to them\r\nrepresentations somewhat like these: “Brethren, our hearts are with you.\r\nWe are with you in faith, in charity, in prayer. We sympathized in the\r\ninjury that had been done you by excision. We stood by you then, and are\r\nready to stand by you still. We have no sympathy with the party that\r\nhave expelled you, and we do not wish to go back to them. As to this\r\nmatter of slavery, we do not differ from you. We consider it an evil. We\r\nmourn and lament over it. We are trying, by gradual and peaceable means,\r\nto exclude it from our churches. We are going as far in advance of the\r\nsentiment of our churches as we consistently can. We cannot come up to\r\nmore decided action without losing our hold over them, and, as we think,\r\nthrowing back the cause of emancipation. If you begin in this decided\r\nmanner, we cannot hold our churches in the union; they will divide, and\r\ngo to the Old School.”\r\n\r\nHere was a very strong plea, made by good and sincere men. It was an\r\nappeal, too, to the most generous feelings of the heart. It was, in\r\neffect, saying, “Brothers, we stood by you, and fought your battles,\r\nwhen everything was going against you; and, now that you have the power\r\nin your hands, are you going to use it so as to cast us out?”\r\n\r\nThese men, strong anti-slavery men as they were, were affected. One\r\nmember of the committee foresaw and feared the result. He felt and\r\nsuggested that the course proposed conceded the whole question. The\r\nmajority thought, on the whole, that it was best to postpone the\r\nsubject. The committee reported that the applicants, for reasons\r\nsatisfactory to themselves, had withdrawn their papers.\r\n\r\nThe next year, in 1839, the subject was resumed; and it was again urged\r\nthat the Assembly should take high and decided and unmistakable ground;\r\nand certainly, if we consider that all this time not a single church had\r\nemancipated its slaves, and that the power of the institution was\r\neverywhere stretching and growing and increasing, it would certainly\r\nseem that something more efficient was necessary than a general\r\nunderstanding that the church agreed with the testimony delivered in\r\n1818. It was strongly represented that it was time something was done.\r\nThis year the Assembly decided to refer the subject to presbyteries, to\r\ndo what they deemed advisable. The words employed were these: “Solemnly\r\nreferring the whole subject to the lower judicatories, to take such\r\naction as in their judgment is most judicious, and adapted to remove the\r\nevil.” This of course deferred, but did not avert, the main question.\r\n\r\nThis brought, in 1840, a much larger number of memorials and petitions;\r\nand very strong attempts were made by the abolitionists to obtain some\r\ndecided action.\r\n\r\nThe committee this year referred to what had been done last year, and\r\ndeclared it inexpedient to do anything further. The subject was\r\nindefinitely postponed. At this time it was resolved that the Assembly\r\nshould meet only once in three years.[26] Accordingly, it did not meet\r\ntill 1843. In 1843, several memorials were again presented, and some\r\nresolutions offered to the Assembly, of which this was one (Minutes of\r\nthe General Assembly for 1843, p. 15):\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That we affectionately and earnestly urge upon the\r\n  Ministers, Sessions, Presbyteries and Synods connected with this\r\n  Assembly, that they treat this as all other sins of great magnitude;\r\n  and, by a diligent, kind and faithful application of the means which\r\n  God has given them, by instruction, remonstrance, reproof and\r\n  effective discipline, seek to purify the church of this great\r\n  iniquity.\r\n\r\nThis resolution they declined. They passed the following:\r\n\r\n  Whereas there is in this Assembly great diversity of opinion as to\r\n  the proper and best mode of action on the subject of slavery; and\r\n  whereas, in such circumstances, any expression of sentiment would\r\n  carry with it but little weight, as it would be passed by a small\r\n  majority, and must operate to produce alienation and division; and\r\n  whereas the Assembly of 1839, with great unanimity, referred this\r\n  whole subject to the lower judicatories, to take such order as in\r\n  their judgment might be adapted to remove the evil;—_Resolved_, That\r\n  the Assembly do not think it for the edification of the church for\r\n  this body to take any action on the subject.\r\n\r\nThey, however, passed the following:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the fashionable amusement of promiscuous dancing is\r\n  so entirely unscriptural, and eminently and exclusively that of “the\r\n  world which lieth in wickedness,” and so wholly inconsistent with\r\n  the spirit of Christ, and with that propriety of Christian\r\n  deportment and that purity of heart which his followers are bound to\r\n  maintain, as to render it not only improper and injurious for\r\n  professing Christians either to partake in it, or to qualify their\r\n  children for it, by teaching them the _art_, but also to call for\r\n  the faithful and judicious exercise of discipline on the part of\r\n  Church Sessions, when any of the members of their churches have been\r\n  guilty.\r\n\r\nThree years after, in 1846, the General Assembly published the following\r\ndeclaration of sentiment:\r\n\r\n  1. The system of slavery, as it exists in these United States,\r\n  viewed either in the laws of the several states which sanction it,\r\n  or in its actual operation and results in society, is intrinsically\r\n  unrighteous and oppressive; and is opposed to the prescriptions of\r\n  the law of God, to the spirit and precepts of the gospel, and to the\r\n  best interests of humanity.\r\n\r\n  2. The testimony of the General Assembly, from A. D. 1787 to A. D.\r\n  1818, inclusive, has condemned it; and it remains still the recorded\r\n  testimony of the Presbyterian Church of these United States against\r\n  it, from which we do not recede.\r\n\r\n  3. We cannot, therefore, withhold the expression of our deep regret\r\n  that slavery should be continued and countenanced by any of the\r\n  members of our churches; and we do earnestly exhort both them and\r\n  the churches among whom it exists to use all means in their power to\r\n  put it away from them. Its perpetuation among them cannot fail to be\r\n  regarded by multitudes, influenced by their example, as sanctioning\r\n  the system portrayed in it, and maintained by the statutes of the\r\n  several slave-holding states, wherein they dwell. Nor can any mere\r\n  mitigation of its severity, prompted by the humanity and Christian\r\n  feeling of any who continue to hold their fellow-men in bondage, be\r\n  regarded either as a testimony against the system, or as in the\r\n  least degree changing its essential character.\r\n\r\n  4. But, while we believe that many evils incident to the system\r\n  render it important and obligatory to bear testimony against it, yet\r\n  would we not undertake to determine the degree of moral turpitude on\r\n  the part of individuals involved by it. This will doubtless be found\r\n  to vary, in the sight of God, according to the degree of light and\r\n  other circumstances pertaining to each. In view of all the\r\n  embarrassments and obstacles in the way of emancipation interposed\r\n  by the statutes of the slave-holding states, and by the social\r\n  influence affecting the views and conduct of those involved in it,\r\n  we cannot pronounce a judgment of general and promiscuous\r\n  condemnation, implying _that_ destitution of Christian principle and\r\n  feeling which should exclude from the table of the Lord all who\r\n  should stand in the legal relation of masters to slaves, or justify\r\n  us in withholding our ecclesiastical and Christian fellowship from\r\n  them. We rather sympathize with, and would seek to succor them in\r\n  their embarrassments, believing that separation and secession among\r\n  the churches and their members are not the methods God approves and\r\n  sanctions for the reformation of his church.\r\n\r\n  5. While, therefore, we feel bound to bear our testimony against\r\n  slavery, and to exhort our beloved brethren to remove it from them\r\n  as speedily as possible, by all appropriate and available means, we\r\n  do at the same time condemn all divisive and schismatical measures,\r\n  tending to destroy the unity and disturb the peace of our church,\r\n  and deprecate the spirit of denunciation and inflicting severities,\r\n  which would cast from the fold those whom we are rather bound, by\r\n  the spirit of the gospel, and the obligations of our covenant, to\r\n  instruct, to counsel, to exhort, and thus to lead in the ways of\r\n  God; and towards whom, even though they may err, we ought to\r\n  exercise forbearance and brotherly love.\r\n\r\n  6. As a court of our Lord Jesus Christ, we possess no legislative\r\n  authority; and as the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church,\r\n  we possess no judiciary authority. We have no right to institute and\r\n  prescribe a test of Christian character and church membership, not\r\n  recognized and sanctioned in the sacred Scriptures, and in our\r\n  standards, by which we have agreed to walk. We must leave,\r\n  therefore, this matter with the sessions, presbyteries and\r\n  synods,—the judicatories to whom pertains the right of judgment to\r\n  act in the administration of discipline, as they may judge it to be\r\n  their duty, constitutionally subject to the General Assembly only in\r\n  the way of general review and control.\r\n\r\nWhen a boat is imperceptibly going down stream on a gentle but strong\r\ncurrent, we can see its passage only by comparing objects with each\r\nother on the shore.\r\n\r\nIf this declaration of the New-school General Assembly be compared with\r\nthat of 1818, it will be found to be far less outspoken and decided in\r\nits tone, while in the mean time slavery had become four-fold more\r\npowerful. In 1818 the Assembly states that the most virtuous portion of\r\nthe community in slave states abhor slavery, and wish its\r\n_extermination_. In 1846 the Assembly states with regret that slavery is\r\nstill continued and countenanced by any of the members of our churches.\r\nThe testimony of 1818 has the frank, outspoken air of a unanimous\r\ndocument, where there was but one opinion. That of 1846 has the guarded\r\nair of a compromise ground out between the upper and nether millstone of\r\ntwo contending parties,—it is winnowed, guarded, cautious and careful.\r\n\r\nConsidering the document, however, in itself, it is certainly a very\r\ngood one; and it would be a very proper expression of Christian feeling,\r\nhad it related to an evil of any common magnitude, and had it been\r\nuttered in any common crisis; but let us consider what was the evil\r\nattacked, and what was the crisis. Consider the picture which the\r\nKentucky Synod had drawn of the actual state of things among them:—“The\r\nmembers of slave-families separated, never to meet again until the final\r\njudgment; brothers and sisters, parents and children, husbands and\r\nwives, daily torn asunder, and permitted to see each other no more; the\r\nshrieks and agonies, proclaiming as with trumpet-tongue the iniquity and\r\ncruelty of the system; the cries of the sufferers going up to the ears\r\nof the Lord of Sabaoth not a neighborhood where those heart-rending\r\nscenes are not displayed; not a village or road without the sad\r\nprocession of manacled outcasts, whose chains and mournful countenances\r\ntell they are exiled by force from all that heart holds dear; Christian\r\nprofessors rending the mother from her child, to sell her into\r\nreturnless exile.”\r\n\r\nThis was the language of the Kentucky Synod fourteen years before; and\r\nthose scenes had been going on ever since, and are going on now, as the\r\nadvertisements of every Southern paper show; and yet the church of\r\nChrist since 1818 had done nothing but express regret, and hold grave\r\nmetaphysical discussions as to whether slavery was an “evil _per se_,”\r\nand censure the rash action of men who, in utter despair of stopping the\r\nevil any other way, tried to stop it by excluding slave-holders from the\r\nchurch. As if it were not better that one slave-holder in a hundred\r\nshould stay out of the church, if he be peculiarly circumstanced, than\r\nthat all this horrible agony and iniquity should continually receive the\r\nsanction of the church’s example! Should not a generous Christian man\r\nsay, “If church excision will stop this terrible evil, let it come,\r\nthough it does bear hardly upon me! Better that I suffer a little\r\ninjustice than that this horrible injustice be still credited to the\r\naccount of Christ’s church. Shall I embarrass the whole church with my\r\nembarrassments? What if I am careful and humane in my treatment of my\r\nslaves,—what if, in my heart, I have repudiated the wicked doctrine that\r\nthey are my property, and am treating them as my brethren,—what am I\r\nthen doing? All the credit of my example goes to give force to the\r\nsystem. The church ought to reprove this fearful injustice, and\r\nreprovers ought to have clean hands: and if I cannot really get clear of\r\nthis, I had better keep out of the church till I can.”\r\n\r\nLet us consider, also, the awful intrenchments and strength of the evil\r\nagainst which this very moderate resolution was discharged. “A money\r\npower of two thousand millions of dollars, held by a small body of able\r\nand desperate men; that body raised into a political aristocracy by\r\nspecial constitutional provisions: cotton, the product of slave-labor,\r\nforming the basis of our whole foreign commerce, and the commercial\r\nclass thus subsidized; the press bought up; the Southern pulpit reduced\r\nto vassalage; the heart of the common people chilled by a bitter\r\nprejudice against the black race; and our leading men bribed by ambition\r\neither to silence or open hostility.”[27] And now, in this condition of\r\nthings, the whole weight of these churches goes in support of slavery,\r\nfrom the fact of their containing slave-holders. No matter if they did\r\nnot participate in the abuses of the system; nobody wants them to do\r\nthat. The slave-power does not wish professors of religion to separate\r\nfamilies, or over-work their slaves, or do any disreputable thing,—that\r\nis not _their part_. The slave power wants pious, tender-hearted,\r\ngenerous and humane masters, and must have them, to hold up the system\r\nagainst the rising moral sense of the world; and the more pious and\r\ngenerous the better. Slavery could not stand an hour without these men.\r\nWhat then? These men uphold the system, and that great anti-slavery body\r\nof ministers uphold these men. That is the final upshot of the matter.\r\n\r\nPaul says that we must remember those that are in bonds, as bound with\r\nthem. Suppose that this General Assembly had been made up of men who had\r\nbeen fugitives. Suppose one of them had had his daughters sent to the\r\nNew Orleans slave-market, like Emily and Mary Edmondson; that another’s\r\ndaughter had died on the overland passage in a slave-coffle, with no\r\nnurse but a slave-driver, like poor Emily Russell; another’s wife died\r\nbroken-hearted, when her children were sold out of her bosom; and\r\nanother had a half-crazed mother, whose hair had been turned prematurely\r\nwhite with agony. Suppose these scenes of agonizing partings, with\r\nshrieks and groans, which the Kentucky Synod says have been witnessed so\r\nlong among the slaves, had been seen in these ministers’ families, and\r\nthat they had come up to this discussion with their hearts as scarred\r\nand seared as the heart of poor old Paul Edmondson, when he came to New\r\nYork to beg for his daughters. Suppose that they saw that the horrid\r\nsystem by which all this had been done was extending every hour; that\r\nprofessed Christians in every denomination at the South declared it to\r\nbe an appointed institution of God; that all the wealth, and all the\r\nrank, and all the fashion, in the country, were committed in its favor;\r\nand that they, like Aaron, were sent to stand between the living and the\r\ndead, that the plague might be stayed.\r\n\r\nMost humbly, most earnestly, let it be submitted to the Christians of\r\nthis nation, and to Christians of all nations, for such an hour and such\r\na crisis was this action sufficient? Did it _do_ anything? Has it had\r\nthe least effect in stopping the evil? And, in such a horrible time,\r\nought not something to be _done_ which will have that effect?\r\n\r\nLet us continue the history. It will be observed that the resolution\r\nconcludes by referring the subject to subordinate judicatories. The New\r\nSchool Presbytery of Cincinnati, in which were the professors of Lane\r\nSeminary, suspended Mr. Graham from the ministry for teaching that the\r\nBible justified slavery; thereby establishing the principle that this\r\nwas a heresy inconsistent with Christian fellowship. The Cincinnati\r\nSynod confirmed this decision. The General Assembly reversed this\r\ndecision, and restored Mr. Graham. The delegate from that presbytery\r\ntold them that they would _never_ retrace their steps, and so it proved.\r\nThe Cincinnati Presbytery refused to receive him back. All honor be to\r\nthem for it! Here, at least, was a principle established, as far as the\r\nNew School Cincinnati Presbytery is concerned,—and a principle as far as\r\nthe General Assembly is concerned. By this act the General Assembly\r\nestablished the fact that the New School Presbyterian Church _had_ not\r\ndecided the Biblical defence of slavery to be a heresy.\r\n\r\nFor a man to teach that there are not three persons in the Trinity is\r\nheresy.\r\n\r\nFor a man to teach that all these three Persons authorize a system which\r\neven Mahometan princes have abolished from mere natural shame and\r\nconscience, is no heresy!\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly proceeded further to show that it considered this\r\ndoctrine no heresy, in the year 1846, by inviting the Old School General\r\nAssembly to the celebration of the Lord’s supper with them. Connected\r\nwith this Assembly were, not only Dr. Smylie, and all those bodies who,\r\namong them, had justified not only slavery in the abstract, but some of\r\nits worst abuses, by the word of God; yet the New School body thought\r\nthese opinions _no heresy_ which should be a bar to Christian communion!\r\n\r\nIn 1849 the General Assembly declared[28] that there had been no\r\ninformation before the Assembly to prove that the members in slave\r\nstates were not doing all that they could, in the providence of God, to\r\nbring about the possession and enjoyment of liberty by the enslaved.\r\nThis is a remarkable declaration, if we consider that in Kentucky there\r\nare no stringent laws against emancipation, and that, either in Kentucky\r\nor Virginia, the slave can be set free by simply giving him a pass to go\r\nacross the line into the next state.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 a proposition was presented in the Assembly, by the Rev. H.\r\nCurtiss, of Indiana, to the following effect: “That the enslaving of\r\nmen, or holding them as property, is an offence, as defined in our Book\r\nof Discipline, ch. 1, sec. 3; and as such it calls for inquiry,\r\ncorrection and removal, in the manner prescribed by our rules, and\r\nshould be treated with a due regard to all the aggravating or mitigating\r\ncircumstances in each case.” Another proposition was from an elder in\r\nPennsylvania, affirming “that slaveholding was, _prima facie_, an\r\noffence within the meaning of our Book of Discipline, and throwing upon\r\nthe slave-holder the burden of showing such circumstances as will take\r\naway from him the guilt of the offence.”[29]\r\n\r\nBoth these propositions were rejected. The following was adopted: “That\r\nslavery is fraught with many and great evils; that they deplore the\r\nworkings of the whole system of slavery; that the holding of our\r\nfellow-men in the condition of slavery, except in those cases where it\r\nis unavoidable _from the laws of the state, the obligations of\r\nguardianship, or the demands of humanity_, is an offence, in the proper\r\nimport of that term, as used in the Book of Discipline, and should be\r\nregarded and treated in the same manner as other offences; also\r\nreferring this subject to sessions and presbyteries.” The vote stood\r\neighty-four to sixteen, under a written protest of the minority, who\r\nwere for no action in the present state of the country. Let the reader\r\nagain compare this action with that of 1818, and he will see that the\r\nboat is still drifting,—especially as even this moderate testimony was\r\nnot unanimous. Again, in this year of 1850, they avow themselves ready\r\nto meet, in a spirit of fraternal kindness and Christian love, any\r\novertures for reünion which may be made to them by the Old School body.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 was passed the cruel fugitive slave law. What deeds were done\r\nthen! Then to our free states were transported those scenes of fear and\r\nagony before acted only on slave soil. Churches were broken up.\r\nTrembling Christians fled. Husbands and wives were separated. Then to\r\nthe poor African was fulfilled the dread doom denounced on the wandering\r\nJew,—“Thou shalt find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have\r\nrest; but thy life shall hang in doubt before thee, and thou shalt fear\r\nday and night, and shalt have no assurance of thy life.” Then all the\r\nworld went one way,—all the wealth, all the power, all the fashion. Now,\r\nif ever, was a time for Christ’s church to stand up and speak for the\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly met. She was earnestly memorialized to speak out.\r\nNever was a more glorious opportunity to show that the kingdom of Christ\r\nis not of this world. A protest then, from a body so numerous and\r\nrespectable, might have saved the American church from the disgrace it\r\nnow wears in the eyes of all nations. O that she had once spoken! What\r\nsaid the Presbyterian Church? She said _nothing_, and the thanks of\r\npolitical leaders were accorded to her. She had done _all_ they desired.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, under this course of things, the number of presbyteries in\r\nslave-holding states had increased from _three_ to _twenty_! and this\r\nchurch has now under its care from fifteen to twenty thousand members in\r\nslave states.\r\n\r\nSo much for the course of a decided anti-slavery body in union with a\r\nfew slave-holding churches. So much for a most discreet, judicious,\r\ncharitable, and brotherly attempt to test by experience the question,\r\nWhat communion hath light with darkness, and what concord hath Christ\r\nwith Belial? The slave-system is darkness,—the slave-system is Belial!\r\nand every attempt to harmonize it with the profession of Christianity\r\nwill be just like these. Let it be here recorded, however, that a small\r\nbody of the most determined opponents of slavery in the Presbyterian\r\nChurch seceded and formed the _Free Presbyterian Church_, whose terms of\r\ncommunion are, an entire withdrawal from slave-holding. Whether this\r\nprinciple be a correct one, or not, it is worthy of remark that it was\r\nadopted and carried out by the Quakers,—the only body of Christians\r\ninvolved in this evil who have ever succeeded in freeing themselves from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhether church discipline and censure is an appropriate medium for\r\ncorrecting such immoralities and heresies in individuals, or not, it is\r\nenough for the case that this has been the established opinion and\r\npractice of the Presbyterian Church.\r\n\r\nIf the argument of Charles Sumner be contemplated, it will be seen that\r\nthe history of this Presbyterian Church and the history of our United\r\nStates have strong points of similarity. In both, at the outset, the\r\nstrong influence was anti-slavery, even among slave-holders. In both\r\nthere was no difference of opinion as to the desirableness of abolishing\r\nslavery ultimately; both made a concession, the smallest which could\r\npossibly be imagined; both made the concession in all good faith,\r\ncontemplating the speedy removal and extinction of the evil; and the\r\nhistory of both is alike. The little point of concession spread, and\r\nabsorbed, and acquired, from year to year, till the United States and\r\nthe Presbyterian Church stand _just where they do_. Worse has been the\r\nhistory of the Methodist Church. The history of the Baptist Church shows\r\nthe same principle; and, as to the Episcopal Church, it has never done\r\nanything _but_ comply, either North or South. It differs from all the\r\nrest in that it has never had any resisting element, except now and then\r\na protestant, like William Jay, a worthy son of him who signed the\r\nDeclaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nThe slave power has been a united, consistent, steady, uncompromising\r\nprinciple. The resisting element has been, for many years, wavering,\r\nself-contradictory, compromising. There has been, it is true, a deep,\r\nand ever increasing hostility to slavery in a decided majority of\r\nministers and church-members in free states, _taken as individuals_.\r\nNevertheless, the sincere opponents of slavery have been unhappily\r\ndivided among themselves as to principles and measures, the extreme\r\nprinciples and measures of some causing a hurtful reaction in others.\r\nBesides this, other great plans of benevolence have occupied their time\r\nand attention; and the result has been that they have formed altogether\r\ninadequate conceptions of the extent to which the cause of God on earth\r\nis imperilled by American slavery, and of the duty of Christians in such\r\na crisis. They have never had such a conviction as has aroused, and\r\ncalled out, and united their energies, on this, as on other great\r\ncauses. Meantime, great organic influences in church and state are, much\r\nagainst their wishes, neutralizing their influence against\r\nslavery,—sometimes even arraying it in its favor. The perfect\r\ninflexibility of the slave-system, and its absolute refusal to allow any\r\ndiscussion of the subject, has reduced all those who wish to have\r\nreligious action in common with slave-holding churches to the\r\nalternative of either giving up the support of the South for that\r\nobject, or giving up their protest against slavery.\r\n\r\nThis has held out a strong temptation to men who have had benevolent and\r\nlaudable objects to carry, and who did not realize the full peril of the\r\nslave-system, nor appreciate the moral power of Christian protest\r\nagainst it. When, therefore, cases have arisen where the choice lay\r\nbetween sacrificing what they considered the interests of a good object,\r\nor giving up their right of protest, they have generally preferred the\r\nlatter. The decision has always gone in this way: The slave power _will\r\nnot_ concede,—we _must_. The South says, “We will take no religious book\r\nthat has anti-slavery principles in it.” The Sunday School Union drops\r\nMr. Gallaudet’s History of Joseph. Why? Because they approve of slavery?\r\nNot at all. They look upon slavery with horror. What then? “The South\r\nwill not read our books, if we do not do it. They will not give up, and\r\nwe must. We _can do more good_ by introducing gospel truth with this\r\nomission than we can by using our protestant power.” This, probably, was\r\nthought and said honestly. The argument is plausible, but the concession\r\nis none the less real. The slave power has got the victory, and got it\r\nby the very best of men from the very best of motives; and, so that it\r\nhas the victory, it cares not how it gets it. And although it may be\r\nsaid that the amount in each case of these concessions is in itself but\r\nsmall, yet, when we come to add together all that have been made from\r\ntime to time by every different denomination, and by every different\r\nbenevolent organization, the aggregate is truly appalling; and, in\r\nconsequence of all these united, what are we now reduced to?\r\n\r\nHere we are, in this crisis,—here in this nineteenth century, when all\r\nthe world is dissolving and reconstructing on principles of universal\r\nliberty,—we Americans, who are sending our Bibles and missionaries to\r\nChristianize Mahometan lands, are upholding, with all our might and all\r\nour influence, a system of worn-out heathenism which even the Bey of\r\nTunis has repudiated!\r\n\r\nThe Southern church has baptized it in the name of the Father, the Son,\r\nand the Holy Ghost. This worn-out, old, effete system of Roman slavery,\r\nwhich Christianity once gradually but certainly abolished, has been dug\r\nup out of its dishonored grave, a few laws of extra cruelty, such as\r\nRome never knew, have been added to it, and now, baptized and sanctioned\r\nby the whole Southern church, it is going abroad conquering and to\r\nconquer! The only power left to the Northern church is the protesting\r\npower; and will they use it? Ask the Tract Society if they will publish\r\na tract on the sinfulness of slavery, though such tract should be made\r\nup _solely_ from the writings of Jonathan Edwards or Dr. Hopkins! Ask\r\nthe Sunday School Union if it will publish the facts about this\r\nheathenism, as it has facts about Burmah and Hindostan! Will they? O,\r\nthat they would answer _Yes_!\r\n\r\nNow, it is freely conceded that all these sad results have come in\r\nconsequence of the motions and deliberations of good men, who meant\r\nwell; but it has been well said that, in critical times, when one wrong\r\nstep entails the most disastrous consequences, to _mean_ well is not\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nIn the crisis of a disease, to mean well and lose the patient,—in the\r\nheight of a tempest, to mean well and wreck the ship,—in a great moral\r\nconflict, to mean well and lose the battle,—these are things to be\r\nlamented. We _are_ wrecking the ship,—we _are_ losing the battle. There\r\nis no mistake about it. A little more sleep, a little more slumber, a\r\nlittle more folding of the hands to sleep, and we shall awake in the\r\nwhirls of that maëlstrom which has but one passage, and that downward.\r\n\r\nThere is yet one body of Christians whose influence we have not\r\nconsidered, and that a most important one,—the Congregationalists of New\r\nEngland and of the West. From the very nature of Congregationalism, she\r\ncannot give so united a testimony as Presbyterianism; yet\r\nCongregationalism has spoken out on slavery. Individual bodies have\r\nspoken very strongly, and individual clergymen still stronger. They have\r\nremonstrated with the General Assembly, and they have very decided\r\nanti-slavery papers. But, considering the whole state of public\r\nsentiment, considering the critical nature of the exigency, the mighty\r\nsweep and force of all the causes which are going in favor of slavery,\r\nhas the vehemence and force of the testimony of Congregationalism, _as a\r\nbody_, been equal to the dreadful emergency? It has testimonies on\r\nrecord, very full and explicit, on the evils of slavery; but testimonies\r\nare not all that is wanted. There is abundance of testimonies on record\r\nin the Presbyterian Church, for that matter, quite as good and quite as\r\nstrong as any that have been given by Congregationalism. There have been\r\nquite as many anti-slavery men in the New School Presbyterian Church as\r\nin the Congregational,—quite as strong anti-slavery newspapers; and the\r\nPresbyterian Church has had trial of this matter that the Congregational\r\nChurch has never been exposed to. It has had slave-holders in its own\r\ncommunion; and from this trial Congregationalism has, as yet, been\r\nmostly exempt. Being thus free, ought not the testimony of\r\nCongregationalism to have been more than equal? ought it not to have\r\ndone more than testify?—ought it not to have fought for the question?\r\nLike the brave three hundred in Thermopylæ left to defend the liberties\r\nof Greece, when all others had fled, should they not have thrown in\r\nheart and soul, body and spirit? Have they done it?\r\n\r\nCompare the earnestness which Congregationalism has spent upon some\r\nother subjects with the earnestness which has been spent upon this. Dr.\r\nTaylor taught that all sin consists in sinning, and therefore that there\r\ncould be no sin till a person had sinned; and Dr. Bushnell teaches some\r\nmodifications of the doctrine of the Trinity, nobody seeming to know\r\nprecisely what. The South Carolina presbyteries teach that slavery is\r\napproved by God, and sanctioned by the example of patriarchs and\r\nprophets. Supposing these, now, to be all heresies, which of them is the\r\nworst?—which will bring the worst practical results? And, if\r\nCongregationalism had fought this slavery heresy as some of her leaders\r\nfought Dr. Bushnell and Dr. Taylor, would not the style of battle have\r\nbeen more earnest? Have not both these men been denounced as dangerous\r\nheresiarchs, and as preaching doctrines that tend to infidelity? And\r\npray where does this other doctrine tend? As sure as there is a God in\r\nheaven is the certainty that, if the Bible really did defend slavery,\r\nfifty years hence would see every honorable and high-minded man an\r\ninfidel.\r\n\r\nHas, then, the past influence of Congregationalism been according to the\r\nnature of the exigency and the weight of the subject? But the late\r\nconvention of Congregationalists at Albany, including ministers both\r\nfrom New England and the Western States, did take a stronger and more\r\ndecided ground. Here is their resolution:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That, in the opinion of this convention, it is the\r\n  tendency of the gospel, wherever it is preached in its purity, to\r\n  correct all social evils, and to destroy sin in all its forms; and\r\n  that it is the duty of Missionary Societies to grant aid to churches\r\n  in slave-holding states in the support of such ministers only as\r\n  shall so preach the gospel, and inculcate the principles and\r\n  application of gospel discipline, that, with the blessing of God, it\r\n  shall have its full effect in awakening and enlightening the moral\r\n  sense in regard to slavery, and in bringing to pass the speedy\r\n  abolition of that stupendous wrong; and that wherever a minister is\r\n  not permitted so to preach, he should, in accordance with the\r\n  directions of Christ, “depart out of that city.”\r\n\r\nThis resolution is a matter of hope and gratulation in many respects. It\r\nwas passed in a very large convention,—the largest ever assembled in\r\nthis country, fully representing the Congregationalism of the United\r\nStates,—and the occasion of its meeting was considered, in some sort, as\r\nmarking a new era in the progress of this denomination.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was passed unanimously. It is decided in its expression,\r\nand looks to practical action, which is what is wanted. It says it will\r\nsupport no ministers in slave states whose preaching does not tend to\r\ndestroy slavery; and that, if they are not allowed to preach freely on\r\nthe subject, they must depart.\r\n\r\nThat the ground thus taken will be efficiently sustained, may be\r\ninferred from the fact that the Home Missionary Society, which is the\r\norgan of this body, as well as of the New School Presbyterian Church,\r\nhas uniformly taken decided ground upon this subject in their\r\ninstructions to missionaries sent into slave states. These instructions\r\nare ably set forth in their report of March, 1853. When application was\r\nmade to them, in 1850, from a slave state, for missionaries who would\r\nlet slavery alone, they replied to them, in the most decided language,\r\nthat it could not be done; that, on the contrary, they must understand\r\nthat one grand object in sending missionaries to slave states is, as far\r\nas possible, to redeem society from all forms of sin; and that, “if\r\nutter silence respecting slavery is to be maintained, one of the\r\ngreatest inducements to send or retain missionaries in the slave states\r\nis taken away.”\r\n\r\nThe society furthermore instructed their missionaries, if they could not\r\nbe heard on this subject in one city or village, to go to another; and\r\nthey express their conviction that their missionaries have made progress\r\nin awakening the consciences of the people. They say that they do not\r\nsuffer the subject to sleep; that they do not let it alone because it is\r\na delicate subject, but they discharge their consciences, whether their\r\nmessage be well received, or whether, as in some instances, it subjects\r\nthem to opposition, opprobrium, and personal danger; and that where\r\ntheir endeavors to do this have not been tolerated, they have, in\r\nrepeated cases, at great sacrifice, resigned their position, and\r\ndeparted to other fields. In their report of this year they also quote\r\nletters from ministers in slave-holding states, by which it appears that\r\nthey have actually secured, in the face of much opposition, the right\r\npublicly to preach and propagate their sentiments upon this subject.\r\n\r\nOne of these missionaries says, speaking of slavery, “We are determined\r\nto remove this great difficulty in our way, or die in the attempt. As\r\nChristians and as freemen, we will suffer this libel on our religion and\r\ninstitutions to exist no longer.”\r\n\r\nThis is noble ground.\r\n\r\nAnd, while we are recording the protesting power, let us not forget the\r\nScotch seceders and covenanters, who, with a pertinacity and decision\r\nworthy of the children of the old covenant, have kept themselves clear\r\nfrom the sin of slavery, and have uniformly protested against it. Let us\r\nremember, also, that the Quakers did pursue a course which actually\r\nfreed all their body from the sin of slave-holding, thus showing to all\r\nother denominations that what has been done once can be done again.\r\nAlso, in all denominations, individual ministers and Christians, in\r\nhours that have tried men’s souls, have stood up to bear their\r\ntestimony. Albert Barnes, in Philadelphia, standing in the midst of a\r\ngreat, rich church, on the borders of a slave state, and with all those\r\ntemptations to complicity which have silenced so many, has stood up, in\r\ncalm fidelity, and declared the whole counsel of God upon this subject.\r\nNay, more: he recorded his solemn protest, that “NO INFLUENCES OUT OF\r\nTHE CHURCH COULD SUSTAIN SLAVERY AN HOUR, IF IT WERE NOT SUSTAINED IN\r\nIT;” and, in the last session of the General Assembly, which met at\r\nWashington, disregarding all suggestions of policy, he boldly held the\r\nPresbyterian Church up to the strength of her past declarations, and\r\ndeclared it her duty to attempt the entire abolition of slavery\r\nthroughout the world. So, in darkest hour, Dr. Channing bore a noble\r\ntestimony in Boston, for which his name shall ever live. So, in\r\nIllinois, E. P. Lovejoy and Edward Beecher, with their associates,\r\nformed the Illinois Anti-slavery Society, amid mobs and at the hazard of\r\ntheir lives; and, a few hours after, Lovejoy was shot down in attempting\r\nto defend the twice-destroyed anti-slavery press. In the Old-school\r\nPresbyterian Church, William and Robert Breckenridge, President Young,\r\nand others, have preached in favor of emancipation in Kentucky. Le Roy\r\nSunderland, in the Methodist Church, kept up his newspaper under ban of\r\nhis superiors, and with a bribe on his life of fifty thousand dollars,\r\nTorrey, meekly patient, died in a prison, saying, “If I am a guilty man\r\nI am a very guilty one, for I have helped four hundred slaves to\r\nfreedom, who but for me would have died slaves.” Dr. Nelson was expelled\r\nby mobs from Missouri for the courageous declaration of the truth on\r\nslave soil. All these were in the ministry. Nor are these all. Jesus\r\nChrist has not wholly deserted us yet. There have been those who have\r\nlearned how joyful it is to suffer shame and brave death in a good\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nAlso there have been private Christians who have counted nothing too\r\ndear for this sacred cause. Witness Richard Dillingham, and John\r\nGarrett, and a host of others, who took joyfully the spoiling of their\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nBut yet, notwithstanding this, the awful truth remains, that the whole\r\nof what has been done by the church has not, as yet, perceptibly abated\r\nthe evil. The great system is stronger than ever. It is confessedly the\r\ndominant power of the nation. The whole power of the government, and the\r\nwhole power of the wealth, and the whole power of the fashion, and the\r\npractical organic workings of the large bodies of the church, are all\r\ngone one way. The church is familiarly quoted as being on the side of\r\nslavery. Statesmen on both sides of the question have laid that down as\r\na settled fact. Infidels point to it with triumph; and America, too, is\r\nbeholding another class of infidels,—a class that could have grown up\r\nonly under such an influence. Men, whose whole life is one study and\r\npractice of benevolence, are now ranked as infidels, because the\r\nposition of church organizations misrepresents Christianity, and they\r\nseparate themselves from the church. We would offer no excuse for any\r\ninfidels who take for their religion mere anti-slavery zeal, and, under\r\nthis guise, gratify a malignant hatred of real Christianity. But such\r\ndefences of slavery from the Bible as some of the American clergy have\r\nmade are exactly fitted to make infidels of all honorable and\r\nhigh-minded men. The infidels of olden times were not much to be\r\ndreaded, but such infidels as these are not to be despised. Woe to the\r\nchurch when the moral standard of the infidel is higher than the\r\nstandard of the professed Christian! for the only armor that ever proved\r\ninvincible to infidelity is the _armor of righteousness_.\r\n\r\nLet us see how the church organizations work now, practically. What do\r\nBruin & Hill, Pulliam & Davis, Bolton, Dickins & Co., and Matthews,\r\nBranton & Co., depend upon to keep their slave-factories and\r\nslave-barracoons full, and their business brisk? Is it to be supposed\r\nthat they are not men like ourselves? Do they not sometimes tremble at\r\nthe awful workings of fear, and despair, and agony, which they witness\r\nwhen they are tearing asunder living hearts in the depths of those\r\nfearful slave-prisons? What, then, keeps down the consciences of these\r\ntraders? It is the public sentiment of the community where they live;\r\nand that public sentiment is made by ministers and church-members. The\r\ntrader sees plainly enough a logical sequence between the declarations\r\nof the church and the practice of his trade. He sees plainly enough\r\nthat, if slavery is sanctioned by God, and it is right to set it up in a\r\nnew territory, it is right to take the means to do this; and, as slaves\r\ndo not grow on bushes in Texas, it is necessary that there should be\r\ntraders to gather up coffles and carry them out there;—and, as they\r\ncannot always take whole families, it is necessary that they should part\r\nthem; and, as slaves will not go by moral suasion, it is necessary that\r\nthey should be forced; and, as gentle force will not do, they must whip\r\nand torture. Hence come gags, thumb-screws, cowhides, blood,—all\r\n_necessary_ measures of carrying out what Christians say God sanctions.\r\n\r\nSo goes the argument one way. Let us now trace it back the other. The\r\nSouth Carolina and Mississippi Presbyteries maintain opinions which, in\r\ntheir legitimate results, endorse the slave-trader. The Old School\r\nGeneral Assembly maintains fellowship with these Presbyteries, without\r\ndiscipline or protest. The New School Assembly signifies its willingness\r\nto reünite with the Old, while, at the same time, it declares the system\r\nof slavery an abomination, a gross violation of the most sacred rights,\r\nand so on. Well, now the chain is as complete as need be. All parts are\r\nin; every one standing in his place, and saying just what is required,\r\nand no more. The trader does the repulsive work, the Southern church\r\ndefends him, the Northern church defends the South. Every one does as\r\nmuch for slavery as would be at all expedient, considering the latitude\r\nthey live in. This is the practical result of the thing.\r\n\r\nThe melancholy part of the matter is, that while a large body of New\r\nSchool men, and many Old School, are decided anti-slavery men, this\r\ndenominational position carries their influence on the other side. As\r\ngoes the General Assembly, so goes their influence. The following\r\naffecting letter on this subject was written by that eminently pious\r\nman, Dr. Nelson, whose work on Infidelity is one of the most efficient\r\npopular appeals that has ever appeared:\r\n\r\n  I have resided in North Carolina more than forty years, and been\r\n  intimately acquainted with the system, and I can scarcely even think\r\n  of its operations without shedding tears. It causes me excessive\r\n  grief to think of my own poor slaves, for whom I have for years been\r\n  trying to find a free home. It strikes me with equal astonishment\r\n  and horror to hear Northern people make light of slavery. Had they\r\n  seen and known as much of it as I, they could not thus treat it,\r\n  unless callous to the deepest woes and degradation of humanity, and\r\n  dead both to the religion and philanthropy of the gospel. But many\r\n  of them are doing just what the hardest-hearted tyrants of the South\r\n  most desire. Those tyrants would not, on any account, have them\r\n  advocate or even apologize for slavery in an _unqualified_ manner.\r\n  This would be bad policy with the North. I wonder that Gerritt Smith\r\n  should understand slavery so much better than most of the Northern\r\n  people. How true was his remark, on a certain occasion, namely, that\r\n  the South are laughing in their sleeves, to think what dupes they\r\n  make of most of the people at the North in regard to the real\r\n  character of slavery! Well did Mr. Smith remark that the system,\r\n  carried out on its fundamental principle, would as soon enslave any\r\n  laboring white man as the African. But, _if it were not for the\r\n  support of the North, the fabric of blood would fall at once_. And\r\n  of all the efforts of public bodies at the North to sustain slavery,\r\n  the Connecticut General Association has made the best one. I have\r\n  never seen anything so well constructed in that line as their\r\n  resolutions of June, 1836. The South certainly could not have asked\r\n  anything more effectual. But, of all Northern periodicals, the _New\r\n  York Observer_ must have the preference, as an efficient support of\r\n  slavery. I am not sure but it does more than all things combined to\r\n  keep the dreadful system alive. It is just the succor demanded by\r\n  the South. Its abuse of the abolitionists is music in Southern ears,\r\n  which operates as a charm. But nothing is equal to its harping upon\r\n  the “religious privileges and instruction” of the slaves of the\r\n  South. And nothing could be so false and injurious (to the cause of\r\n  freedom and religion) as the impression it gives on that subject. I\r\n  say what I know when I speak in relation to this matter. I have been\r\n  intimately acquainted with the religious opportunities of slaves,—in\r\n  the constant habit of hearing the sermons which are preached to\r\n  them. And I solemnly affirm, that, during the forty years of my\r\n  residence and observation in this line, I never heard a single one\r\n  of these sermons but what was taken up with the obligations and\r\n  duties of slaves to their masters. Indeed, I never heard a sermon to\r\n  slaves but what made obedience to masters by the slaves the\r\n  fundamental and supreme law of religion. Any candid and intelligent\r\n  man can decide whether such preaching is not, as to religious\r\n  purposes, worse than none at all.\r\n\r\n  Again: it is wonderful how the credulity of the North is subjected\r\n  to imposition in regard to the _kind treatment_ of slaves. For\r\n  myself, I can clear up the apparent contradictions found in writers\r\n  who have resided at or visited the South. The “majority of\r\n  slave-holders,” say some, “treat their slaves with kindness.” Now,\r\n  this may be true in certain states and districts setting aside all\r\n  questions of treatment except such as refer to the _body_. And yet,\r\n  while the “majority of slave-holders” in a certain section may be\r\n  kind, the majority of _slaves_ in that section will be treated with\r\n  cruelty. This is the truth in many such cases, that while there may\r\n  be thirty men who may have but one slave apiece, and that a\r\n  house-servant, a _single_ man in their neighborhood may have a\r\n  hundred slaves,—all field-hands, half-fed, worked excessively, and\r\n  whipped most cruelly. This is what I have often seen. To give a\r\n  case, to show the awful influence of slavery upon the master, I will\r\n  mention a Presbyterian elder, who was esteemed one of the best men\r\n  in the region,—a very kind master. I was called to his death-bed to\r\n  write his will. He had what was considered a favorite house-servant,\r\n  a female. After all other things were disposed of, the elder paused,\r\n  as if in doubt what to do with “Su.” I entertained pleasing\r\n  expectations of hearing the word “liberty” fall from his lips; but\r\n  who can tell my surprise when I heard the master exclaim, “What\r\n  shall be done with Su? I am afraid she will never be under a master\r\n  severe enough for her.” Shall I say that both the dying elder and\r\n  his “Su” were members of the same church, the latter statedly\r\n  receiving the emblems of a Saviour’s dying love from the former!\r\n\r\nAll this temporizing and concession has been excused on the plea of\r\nbrotherly love. What a plea for us Northern freemen! Do we think the\r\nslave-system such a happy, desirable thing for our brothers and sisters\r\nat the South? Can we look at our common schools, our neat, thriving\r\ntowns and villages, our dignified, intelligent, self-respecting farmers\r\nand mechanics, all concomitants of free labor, and think slavery any\r\nblessing to our Southern brethren? That system which beggars all the\r\nlower class of whites, which curses the very soil, which eats up\r\neverything before it, like the palmer-worm, canker and locust,—which\r\nmakes common schools an impossibility, and the preaching of the gospel\r\nalmost as much so,—this system a blessing! Does brotherly love require\r\nus to help the South preserve it?\r\n\r\nConsider the educational influences under which such children as Eva and\r\nHenrique must grow up there! We are speaking of what many a Southern\r\nmother feels, of what makes many a Southern father’s heart sore. Slavery\r\nhas been spoken of in its influence on the family of the slave. There\r\nare those, who never speak, who could tell, if they would, its influence\r\non the family of the master. It makes one’s heart ache to see generation\r\nafter generation of lovely, noble children exposed to such influences.\r\nWhat a country the South might be, could she develop herself without\r\nthis curse! If the Southern character, even under all these\r\ndisadvantages, retains so much that is noble, and is fascinating even in\r\nits faults, what might it do with free institutions?\r\n\r\nWho is the real, who is the true and noble lover of the South?—they who\r\nlove her with all these faults and incumbrances, or they who fix their\r\neyes on the bright ideal of what she might be, and say that these faults\r\nare no proper part of her? Is it true love to a friend to accept the\r\nravings of insanity as a true specimen of his mind? Is it true love to\r\naccept the disfigurement of sickness as a specimen of his best\r\ncondition? Is it not truer love to say, “This curse is no part of our\r\nbrother; it dishonors him; it does him injustice; it misrepresents him\r\nin the eyes of all nations. We love his better self, and we will have no\r\nfellowship with his betrayer. This is the part of true, generous,\r\nChristian love.”\r\n\r\nBut will it be said. “The abolition enterprise was begun in a wrong\r\nspirit, by reckless, meddling, impudent fanatics”? Well, supposing that\r\nthis were true, how came it to be so? If the church of Christ had begun\r\nit _right_, these so-called fanatics would not have begun it _wrong_. In\r\na deadly pestilence, if the right physicians do not prescribe, everybody\r\nwill prescribe,—men, women and children, will prescribe,—because\r\nsomething must be done. If the Presbyterian Church in 1818 had pursued\r\nthe course the Quakers did, there never would have been any fanaticism.\r\nThe Quakers did all by brotherly love. They melted the chains of Mammon\r\nonly in the fires of a divine charity. When Christ came into Jerusalem,\r\nafter all the mighty works that he had done, while all the so-called\r\nbetter classes were non-committal or opposed, the multitude cut down\r\nbranches of palm-trees and cried Hosanna! There was a most indecorous\r\ntumult. The very children caught the enthusiasm, and were crying\r\nHosannas in the temple. This was contradictory to all ecclesiastical\r\nrules. It was a highly improper state of things. The Chief Priests and\r\nScribes said unto Jesus, “Master, speak unto these that they hold their\r\npeace.” That gentle eye flashed as he answered, “I TELL YOU, IF THESE\r\nSHOULD HOLD THEIR PEACE, THE VERY STONES WOULD CRY OUT.”\r\n\r\nSuppose a fire bursts out in the streets of Boston, while the regular\r\nconservators of the city, who have the keys of the fire-engines, and the\r\nregulation of fire-companies, are sitting together in some distant part\r\nof the city, consulting for the public good. The cry of fire reaches\r\nthem, but they think it a false alarm. The fire is no less real, for all\r\nthat. It burns, and rages, and roars, till everybody in the neighborhood\r\nsees that something must be done. A few stout leaders break open the\r\ndoors of the engine-houses, drag out the engines, and begin, regularly\r\nor irregularly, playing on the fire. But the destroyer still advances.\r\nMessengers come in hot haste to the hall of these deliberators, and, in\r\nthe unselect language of fear and terror, revile them for not coming\r\nout.\r\n\r\n“Bless me!” says a decorous leader of the body, “what horrible language\r\nthese men use!”\r\n\r\n“They show a very bad spirit,” remarks another; “we can’t possibly join\r\nthem in such a state of things.”\r\n\r\nHere the more energetic members of the body rush out, to see if the\r\nthing be really so: and in a few minutes come back, if possible more\r\nearnest than the others.\r\n\r\n“O! there is a fire!—a horrible, dreadful fire! The city is\r\nburning,—men, women, children, all burning, perishing! Come out, come\r\nout! As the Lord liveth, there is but a step between us and death!”\r\n\r\n“I am not going out; everybody that goes gets crazy,” says one.\r\n\r\n“I’ve noticed,” says another, “that as soon as anybody goes out to look,\r\nhe gets just so excited.—I won’t look.”\r\n\r\nBut by this time the angry fire has burned into their very neighborhood.\r\nThe red demon glares into their windows. And now, fairly aroused, they\r\nget up and begin to look out.\r\n\r\n“Well, there _is_ a fire, and no mistake!” says one.\r\n\r\n“Something ought to be done,” says another.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” says a third; “if it wasn’t for being mixed up with such a crowd\r\nand rabble of folks, I’d go out.”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” says another, “there are _women_ in the ranks, carrying\r\npails of water! There, one woman is going up a ladder to get those\r\nchildren out. What an indecorum! If they’d manage this matter properly,\r\nwe would join them.”\r\n\r\nAnd now come lumbering over from Charlestown the engines and\r\nfire-companies.\r\n\r\n“What impudence of Charlestown,” say these men, “to be sending over\r\nhere,—just as if we could not put our own fires out! They have fires\r\nover there, as much as we do.”\r\n\r\nAnd now the flames roar and burn, and shake hands across the streets.\r\nThey leap over the steeples, and glare demoniacally out of the\r\nchurch-windows.\r\n\r\n“For Heaven’s sake, DO SOMETHING!” is the cry. “Pull down the houses!\r\nBlow up those blocks of stores with gunpowder! _Anything_ to stop it.”\r\n\r\n“See, now, what ultra, radical measures they are going at,” says one of\r\nthese spectators.\r\n\r\nBrave men, who have rushed into the thickest of the fire, come out, and\r\nfall dead in the street.\r\n\r\n“They are impracticable enthusiasts. They have thrown their lives away\r\nin foolhardiness,” says another.\r\n\r\nSo, church of Christ, burns that awful fire! Evermore burning, burning,\r\nburning, over church and altar; burning over senate-house and forum;\r\nburning up liberty, burning up religion! No _earthly_ hands kindled that\r\nfire. From its sheeted flame and wreaths of sulphurous smoke glares out\r\nupon thee the eye of that ENEMY who was a murderer from the beginning.\r\nIt is a fire that BURNS TO THE LOWEST HELL!\r\n\r\nChurch of Christ, there _was_ an hour when this fire might have been\r\nextinguished by thee. Now, thou standest like a mighty man\r\nastonished,—like a mighty man that cannot save. But the Hope of Israel\r\nis not dead. The Saviour thereof in time of trouble is yet alive.\r\n\r\nIf every church in our land were hung with mourning,—if every Christian\r\nshould put on sack-cloth,—if “the priest should weep between the porch\r\nand the altar,” and say, “Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thy\r\nheritage to reproach!”—that were not too great a mourning for such a\r\ntime as this.\r\n\r\nO, church of Jesus! consider what hath been said in the midst of thee.\r\nWhat a heresy hast thou tolerated in thy bosom! _Thy_ God the defender\r\nof slavery!—_thy_ God the patron of slave-law! Thou hast suffered the\r\ncharacter of thy God to be slandered. Thou hast suffered false witness\r\nagainst thy Redeemer and thy Sanctifier. The Holy Trinity of heaven has\r\nbeen foully traduced in the midst of thee; and that God whose throne is\r\nawful in justice has been made the patron and leader of oppression.\r\n\r\nThis is a sin against every Christian on the globe.\r\n\r\nWhy do we love and adore, beyond all things, our God? Why do we say to\r\nhim, from our inmost souls, “Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there\r\nis none upon earth I desire beside thee”? Is this a bought up\r\nworship?—is it a cringing and hollow subserviency, because he is great\r\nand rich and powerful, and we _dare_ not do otherwise? His eyes are a\r\nflame of fire;—he reads the inmost soul, and will accept no such\r\nservice. From our souls we adore and love him, because he is holy and\r\njust and good, and will not at all acquit the wicked. We love him\r\nbecause he is the father of the fatherless, the judge of the\r\nwidow;—because he lifteth all who fall, and raiseth them that are bowed\r\ndown. We love Jesus Christ, because he is the _Lamb without spot_, the\r\none altogether lovely. We love the Holy Comforter, because he comes to\r\nconvince the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment. O,\r\nholy church universal, throughout all countries and nations! O, ye great\r\ncloud of witnesses, of all people and languages and tongues!—differing\r\nin many doctrines, but united in crying Worthy is the Lamb that was\r\nslain, for he hath redeemed us from all iniquity!—_awake!_—arise up!—be\r\nnot silent! Testify against this heresy of the latter day, which, if it\r\nwere possible, is deceiving the very elect. Your God, your glory, is\r\nslandered. Answer with the voice of many waters and mighty thunderings!\r\nAnswer with the innumerable multitude in heaven, who cry, day and night,\r\nHoly, holy, holy! _just_ and _true_ are thy ways, O King of saints!\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  This resolution is given in Birney’s pamphlet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  The synods were also made courts of last appeal in judicial cases.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Speech of W. Phillips, Boston.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  Minutes of the New School Assembly, p. 188.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  These two resolutions are given on the authority of Goodel’s History.\r\n  I do not find them in the Minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                               MARTYRDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time when the Methodist and Presbyterian Churches passed the\r\nanti-slavery resolutions which we have recorded, the system of slavery\r\ncould probably have been extirpated by the church with comparatively\r\nlittle trouble. Such was the experience of the Quakers, who tried the\r\nexperiment at that time, and succeeded. The course they pursued was the\r\nsimplest possible. They districted their church, and appointed regular\r\ncommittees, whose business it was to go from house to house, and urge\r\nthe rules of the church individually on each slave-holder, one by one.\r\nThis was done in a spirit of such simplicity and brotherly love that\r\nvery few resisted the appeal. They quietly yielded up, in obedience to\r\ntheir own consciences, and the influence of their brethren. This mode of\r\noperation, though gentle, was as efficient as the calm sun of summer,\r\nwhich, by a few hours of patient shining, dissolves the iceberg on which\r\nall the storms of winter have beat in vain. O, that so happy a course\r\nhad been thought of and pursued by all the other denominations! But the\r\nday is past when this monstrous evil would so quietly yield to gentle\r\nand persuasive measures.\r\n\r\nAt the time that the Quakers made their attempt, this Leviathan in the\r\nreeds and rushes of America was young and callow, and had not learned\r\nhis strength. Then he might have been “drawn out with a hook;” then they\r\nmight have “made a covenant with him, and taken him for a servant\r\nforever;” but now Leviathan is full-grown. “Behold, the hope of him is\r\nvain. Shall not men be cast down even at the sight of him? None is so\r\nfierce that dare stir him up. His scales are his pride, shut up together\r\nas with a close seal; one is so near to another that no air can come\r\nbetween them. The flakes of his flesh are joined together. They are firm\r\nin themselves, they cannot be moved. His heart is as firm as a stone,\r\nyea, as hard as the nether millstone. The sword of him that layeth at\r\nhim cannot hold. He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.\r\nArrows cannot make him flee; sling-stones are turned with him into\r\nstubble. He laugheth at the shaking of a spear. Upon the earth there is\r\nnot his like: he is king over all the children of pride.”\r\n\r\nThere are those who yet retain the delusion that, somehow or other,\r\nwithout any very particular effort or opposition, by a soft, genteel,\r\nrather apologetic style of operation, Leviathan is to be converted,\r\nbaptized and Christianized. They can try it. Such a style answers\r\nadmirably as long as it is understood to mean nothing. But just the\r\nmoment that Leviathan finds they are in earnest, then they will see the\r\nconsequences. The debates of all the synods in the United States, as to\r\nwhether he is an evil _per se_, will not wake him. In fact, they are\r\nrather a pleasant humdrum. Nor will any resolutions that they “behold\r\nhim with regret” give him especial concern; neither will he be much\r\nannoyed by the expressed expectation that he is to die somewhere about\r\nthe millennium. Notwithstanding all the recommendations of synods and\r\nconferences, Leviathan himself has but an indifferent opinion of his own\r\nChristianity, and an impression that he would not be considered quite in\r\nkeeping with the universal reign of Christ on earth; but he doesn’t much\r\nconcern himself about the prospect of giving up the ghost at so very\r\nremote a period.\r\n\r\nBut let any one, either North or South, take the sword of the Spirit and\r\nmake one pass under his scales that he shall feel, and then he will know\r\nwhat sort of a conflict Christian had with Apollyon. Let no one, either\r\nNorth or South, undertake this warfare, to whom fame, or ease, or\r\nwealth, or anything that this world has to give, are too dear to be\r\nsacrificed. Let no one undertake it who is not prepared to hate his own\r\ngood name, and, if need be, his life also. For this reason, we will give\r\nhere the example of one martyr who died for this cause; for it has been\r\nwell said that “the blood of the martyr is the seed of the church.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Elijah P. Lovejoy was the son of a Maine woman, a native of\r\nthat state which, barren in all things else, is fruitful in noble\r\nsentiments and heroic deeds. Of his early days we say nothing. Probably\r\nthey were like those of other Maine boys. We take up his history where\r\nwe find him a clergyman in St. Louis, Mo., editing a religious\r\nnewspaper. Though professing not to be a technical abolitionist, he took\r\nan open and decided stand against slavery. This aroused great\r\nindignation, and called forth threats of violence. Soon after, a mob,\r\ncomposed of the most respectable individuals of the place, burned alive\r\na negro-man in the streets of St. Louis, for stabbing the officers who\r\ncame to arrest him. This scene of protracted torture lasted till the\r\ndeed was completed, and the shrieks of the victim for a more merciful\r\ndeath were disregarded. In his charge to the grand jury, Judge Lawless\r\ndecided that no legal redress could be had for this outrage, because,\r\nbeing the act of an infuriated multitude, it was above the law. Elijah\r\nLovejoy expressed, in determined language, his horror of the transaction\r\nand of the decision. For these causes, his office was torn down and\r\ndestroyed by the mob. Happening to be in St. Charles, a mob of such men\r\nas only slavery could raise attacked the house to take his life. His\r\ndistracted wife kept guard at his door, struggling with men armed with\r\nbludgeons and bowie-knives, who swore that they would have his heart’s\r\nblood. A woman’s last despair, and the aid of friends, repelled the\r\nfirst assault; but when the mob again returned, he made his escape.\r\nLovejoy came to Alton, Illinois, and there set up his paper. The mob\r\nfollowed him. His press was twice destroyed, and he was daily threatened\r\nwith assassination.\r\n\r\nBefore his press was destroyed the third time, a call was issued in his\r\npaper for a convention of the enemies of slavery and friends of free\r\ninquiry in Illinois, for the purpose of considering and recommending\r\nmeasures adapted to meet the existing crisis. This call was signed by\r\nabout two hundred and fifty persons from different parts of the state,\r\namong whom was the Rev. E. Beecher, then President of Illinois College.\r\nThis gathering brought together a large number. When they met for\r\ndiscussion, the mobocrats came also among them, and there was a great\r\nferment. The mob finally out-voted and dissolved the convention. It was\r\nthen resolved to form an anti-slavery society, and to issue a\r\ndeclaration of sentiments, and an address to the people of the state.\r\nThreats were expressed that, if Mr. Lovejoy continued to print his\r\npaper, the mob would destroy his expected press. In this state of\r\nexcitement, Mr. Beecher, at the request of the society, preached two\r\nsermons, setting forth the views and course of conduct which were\r\ncontemplated in the proposed movement. They were subsequently set forth\r\nin a published document, an extract from which will give the reader an\r\nidea of what they were:\r\n\r\n  1. We shall endeavor to induce all our fellow-citizens to elevate\r\n  their minds above all selfish, pecuniary, political, and local\r\n  interests; and, from a deep sense of the presence of God, to regard\r\n  solely the eternal and immutable principles of truth, which no human\r\n  legislature or popular sentiment can alter or remove.\r\n\r\n  2. We shall endeavor to present the question as one between this\r\n  community and God,—a subject on which He deeply feels, and on which\r\n  we owe great and important duties to Him and to our fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n  3. We shall endeavor, as far as possible, to allay the violence of\r\n  party strife, to remove all unholy excitement, and to produce mutual\r\n  confidence and kindness, and a deep interest in the welfare of all\r\n  parts of our nation; and a strong desire to preserve its union and\r\n  promote its highest welfare.\r\n\r\n  Our entire reliance is upon truth and love, and the influences of\r\n  the Holy Spirit. We desire to compel no one to act against his\r\n  judgment or conscience by an oppressive power of public sentiment;\r\n  but to arouse all men to candid thought, and impartial inquiry in\r\n  the fear of God, we do desire.\r\n\r\n  And, to accomplish this end, we shall use the same means that are\r\n  used to enlighten and elevate the public mind on all other great\r\n  moral subjects,—personal influence, public address, the pulpit and\r\n  the press.\r\n\r\n  4. We shall endeavor to produce a new and radical investigation of\r\n  the principles of human rights, and of the relations of all just\r\n  legislation to them, deriving our principles from the nature of the\r\n  human mind, the relations of man to God, and the revealed will of\r\n  the Creator.\r\n\r\n  5. We shall then endeavor to examine the slave-laws of our land in\r\n  the light of these principles, and to prove that they are\r\n  essentially sinful, and that they are at war alike with the will of\r\n  God and all the interests of the master, the slave, and the\r\n  community at large.\r\n\r\n  6. We shall then endeavor to show in what manner communities where\r\n  such laws exist may relieve themselves at once, in perfect safety\r\n  and peace, both of the guilt and dangers of the system.\r\n\r\n  7. And, until communities can be aroused to do their duties, we\r\n  shall endeavor to illustrate and enforce the duties of individual\r\n  slave-holders in such communities.\r\n\r\nTo views presented in this spirit and manner one would think there could\r\nhave been no rational objection. The only difficulty with them was,\r\nthat, though calm and kind, they were felt to be in earnest; and at once\r\nLeviathan was wide awake.\r\n\r\nThe next practical question was, Shall the third printing-press be\r\ndefended, or shall it also be destroyed?\r\n\r\nThere was a tremendous excitement, and a great popular tumult. The\r\ntimid, prudent, peace-loving majority, who are to be found in every\r\ncity, who care not what principles prevail, so they promote their own\r\ninterest, were wavering and pusillanimous, and thus encouraged the mob.\r\nEvery motive was urged to induce Mr. Beecher and Mr. Lovejoy to forego\r\nthe attempt to reëstablish the press. The former was told that a price\r\nhad been set on his head in Missouri,—a fashionable mode of meeting\r\nargument in the pro-slavery parts of this country. Mr. Lovejoy had been\r\nso long threatened with assassination, day and night, that the argument\r\nwith him was something musty. Mr. Beecher was also told that the\r\ninterests of the college of which he was president would be sacrificed,\r\nand that, if he chose to risk his own safety, he had no right to risk\r\nthose interests. But Mr. Beecher and Mr. Lovejoy both felt that the very\r\nfoundation principle of free institutions had at this time been\r\nseriously compromised, all over the country, by yielding up the right of\r\nfree discussion at the clamors of the mob; that it was a precedent of\r\nvery wide and very dangerous application.\r\n\r\nIn a public meeting, Mr. Beecher addressed the citizens on the right of\r\nmaintaining free inquiry, and of supporting every man in the right of\r\npublishing and speaking his conscientious opinions. He read to them some\r\nof those eloquent passages in which Dr. Channing had maintained the same\r\nrights in very similar circumstances in Boston. He read to them extracts\r\nfrom foreign papers, which showed how the American character suffered in\r\nforeign lands from the prevalence in America of Lynch law and mob\r\nviolence. He defended the right of Mr. Lovejoy to print and publish his\r\nconscientious opinions; and, finally, he read from some Southern\r\njournals extracts in which they had strongly condemned the course of the\r\nmob, and vindicated Mr. Lovejoy’s right to express his opinions. He then\r\nproposed to them that they should pass resolutions to the following\r\neffect:\r\n\r\n  That the free communication of opinion is one of the invaluable\r\n  rights of man; and that every citizen may freely speak, write or\r\n  print, on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of the\r\n  liberty.\r\n\r\n  That maintenance of these principles should be independent of all\r\n  regard to persons and sentiments.\r\n\r\n  That they should be especially maintained with regard to unpopular\r\n  sentiments, since no others need the protection of law.\r\n\r\n  That on these grounds alone, and without regard to political and\r\n  moral differences, we agree to protect the press and property of the\r\n  editor of the _Alton Observer_, and support him in his right to\r\n  publish whatever he pleases, holding him responsible only to the\r\n  laws of the land.\r\n\r\nThese resolutions, so proposed, were to be taken into consideration at a\r\nfinal meeting of the citizens, which was to be held the next day.\r\n\r\nThat meeting was held. Their first step was to deprive Mr. Beecher, and\r\nall who were not citizens of that county, of the right of debating on\r\nthe report to be presented. The committee then reported that they deeply\r\nregretted the excited state of feeling; that they cherished strong\r\nconfidence that the citizens would refrain from undue excitements; that\r\nthe exigences of the time required a course of moderation and\r\ncompromise; and that, while there was no disposition to prevent free\r\ndiscussion in general, they deemed it indispensable to the public\r\ntranquillity that Mr. Lovejoy should not publish a paper in that city;\r\nnot wishing to reflect in the slightest degree upon Mr. Lovejoy’s\r\ncharacter and motives. All that the meeting waited for now was, to hear\r\nwhether Mr. Lovejoy would comply with their recommendation.\r\n\r\nOne of the committee arose, and expressed his sympathy for Mr. Lovejoy,\r\ncharacterizing him as an unfortunate individual, hoping that they would\r\nall consider that he had a wife and family to support, and trusting that\r\nthey would disgrace him as little as possible; but that he and all his\r\nparty would see the necessity of making a compromise, and departing from\r\nAlton. What followed is related in the words of Mr. Beecher, who was\r\npresent at the meeting:\r\n\r\n  As Brother Lovejoy rose to reply to the speech above mentioned, I\r\n  watched his countenance with deep interest, not to say anxiety. I\r\n  saw no tokens of disturbance. With a tranquil, self-possessed air,\r\n  he went up to the bar within which the chairman sat, and, in a tone\r\n  of deep, tender and subdued feeling, spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  “I feel, Mr. Chairman, that this is the most solemn moment of my\r\n  life. I feel, I trust, in some measure the responsibilities which at\r\n  this hour I sustain to these my fellow-citizens, to the church of\r\n  which I am a minister, to my country, and to God. And let me beg of\r\n  you, before I proceed further, to construe nothing I shall say as\r\n  being disrespectful to this assembly. I have no such feeling; far\r\n  from it. And if I do not act or speak according to their wishes at\r\n  all times, it is because I cannot conscientiously do it.\r\n\r\n  “It is proper I should state the whole matter, as I understand it,\r\n  before this audience. I do not stand here to argue the question as\r\n  presented by the report of the committee. My only wonder is that the\r\n  honorable gentleman the chairman of that committee, for whose\r\n  character I entertain great respect, though I have not the pleasure\r\n  of his personal acquaintance,—my only wonder is how that gentleman\r\n  could have brought himself to submit such a report.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Chairman, I do not admit that it is the business of this\r\n  assembly to decide whether I shall or shall not publish a newspaper\r\n  in this city. The gentlemen have, as the lawyers say, made a wrong\r\n  issue. I have the _right_ to do it. I know that I have the right\r\n  freely to speak and publish my sentiments, subject only to the laws\r\n  of the land for the abase of that right. This right was given me by\r\n  my Maker; and is solemnly guaranteed to me by the constitution of\r\n  these United States, and of this state. What I wish to know of you\r\n  is, whether you will protect me in the exercise of this right; or\r\n  whether, as heretofore, I am to be subjected to personal indignity\r\n  and outrage. These resolutions, and the measures proposed by them,\r\n  are spoken of as a compromise—a compromise between two parties. Mr.\r\n  Chairman, this is not so. There is but one party here. It is simply\r\n  a question whether the law shall be enforced, or whether the mob\r\n  shall be allowed, as they now do, to continue to trample it under\r\n  their feet, by violating with impunity the rights of an innocent\r\n  individual.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Chairman, what have I to compromise? If freely to forgive those\r\n  who have so greatly injured me, if to pray for their temporal and\r\n  eternal happiness, if still to wish for the prosperity of your city\r\n  and state, notwithstanding all the indignities l have suffered in\r\n  it,—if this be the compromise intended, then do I willingly make it.\r\n  My rights have been shamefully, wickedly outraged; this I know, and\r\n  feel, and can never forget. But I can and do freely forgive those\r\n  who have done it.\r\n\r\n  “But if by a compromise is meant that I should cease from doing that\r\n  which duty requires of me, I cannot make it. And the reason is, that\r\n  I fear God more than I fear man. Think not that I would lightly go\r\n  contrary to public sentiment around me. The good opinion of my\r\n  fellow-men is dear to me, and I would sacrifice anything but\r\n  principle to obtain their good wishes; but when they ask me to\r\n  surrender this, they ask for more than I can, than I dare give.\r\n  Reference is made to the fact that I offered a few days since to\r\n  give up the editorship of the _Observer_ into other hands. This is\r\n  true; I did so because it was thought or said by some that perhaps\r\n  the paper would be better patronized in other hands. They declined\r\n  accepting my offer, however, and since then we have heard from the\r\n  friends and supporters of the paper in all parts of the state. There\r\n  was but one sentiment among them, and this was that the paper could\r\n  be sustained in no other hands than mine. It is also a very\r\n  different question, whether I shall voluntarily, or at the request\r\n  of friends, yield up my post; or whether I shall forsake it at the\r\n  demand of a mob. The former I am at all times ready to do, when\r\n  circumstances occur to require it; as I will never put my personal\r\n  wishes or interests in competition with the cause of that Master\r\n  whose minister I am. But the latter, be assured. I NEVER will do.\r\n  God, in his providence,—so say all my brethren, and so I think,—has\r\n  devolved upon me the responsibility of maintaining my ground here;\r\n  and, Mr. Chairman, I am determined to do it. A voice comes to me\r\n  from Maine, from Massachusetts, from Connecticut, from New-York,\r\n  from Pennsylvania,—yea, from Kentucky, from Mississippi, from\r\n  Missouri,—calling upon me, in the name of all that is dear in heaven\r\n  or earth, to stand fast; and, by the help of God, I WILL STAND. I\r\n  know I am but one, and you are many. My strength would avail but\r\n  little against you all. You can crush me, if you will; but I shall\r\n  die at my post, for I cannot and will not forsake it.\r\n\r\n  “Why should I flee from Alton? Is not this a free state? When\r\n  assailed by a mob at St. Louis, I came hither, as to the home of\r\n  freedom and of the laws. The mob has pursued me here, and why should\r\n  I retreat again? Where can I be safe, if not here? Have not I a\r\n  right to claim the protection of the laws? What more can I have in\r\n  any other place? Sir, the very act of retreating will embolden the\r\n  mob to follow me wherever I go. No, sir, there is no way to escape\r\n  the mob, but to abandon the path of duty; and that, God helping me,\r\n  I will never do.\r\n\r\n  “It has been said here, that my hand is against every man, and every\r\n  man’s hand against me. The last part of the declaration is too\r\n  painfully true. I do indeed find almost every hand lifted against\r\n  _me_; but against whom in this place has my hand been raised? I\r\n  appeal to every individual present; whom of you have I injured?\r\n  Whose character have I traduced? Whose family have I molested? Whose\r\n  business have I meddled with? If any, let him rise here and testify\r\n  against me.—No one answers.\r\n\r\n  “And do not your resolutions say that you find nothing against my\r\n  private or personal character? And does any one believe that, if\r\n  there was anything to be found, it would not be found and brought\r\n  forth? If in anything I have offended against the law, I am not so\r\n  popular in this community as that it would be difficult to convict\r\n  me. You have courts and judges and juries; they find nothing against\r\n  me. And now you come together for the purpose of driving out a\r\n  confessedly innocent man, for no cause but that he dares to think\r\n  and speak as his conscience and his God dictate. Will conduct like\r\n  this stand the scrutiny of your country, of posterity, above all, of\r\n  the judgment-day? For remember, the Judge of that day is no\r\n  respecter of persons. Pause, I beseech you, and reflect! The present\r\n  excitement will soon be over; the voice of conscience will at last\r\n  be heard. And in some season of honest thought, even in this world,\r\n  as you review the scenes of this hour, you will be compelled to say,\r\n  ‘He was right; he was right.’\r\n\r\n  “But you have been exhorted to be lenient and compassionate, and in\r\n  driving me away to affix no unnecessary disgrace upon me. Sir, I\r\n  reject all such compassion. You cannot disgrace me. Scandal and\r\n  falsehood and calumny have already done their worst. My shoulders\r\n  have borne the burthen till it sits easy upon them. You may hang me\r\n  up, as the mob hung up the individuals of Vicksburg! You may burn me\r\n  at the stake, as they did McIntosh at St. Louis; or you may tar and\r\n  feather me, or throw me into the Mississippi, as you have often\r\n  threatened to do; but you cannot disgrace me. I, and I alone, can\r\n  disgrace myself; and the deepest of all disgrace would be, at a time\r\n  like this, to deny my Master by forsaking his cause. He died for me;\r\n  and I were most unworthy to bear his name, should I refuse, if need\r\n  be, to die for him.\r\n\r\n  “Again, you have been told that I have a family, who are dependent\r\n  on me; and this has been given as a reason why I should be driven\r\n  off as gently as possible. It is true, Mr. Chairman, I am a husband\r\n  and a father; and this it is that adds the bitterest ingredient to\r\n  the cup of sorrow I am called to drink. I am made to feel the wisdom\r\n  of the apostle’s advice; ‘It is better not to marry.’ I know, sir,\r\n  that in this contest I stake not my life only, but that of others\r\n  also. I do not expect my wife will ever recover the shock received\r\n  at the awful scenes through which she was called to pass at St.\r\n  Charles. And how was it the other night, on my return to my house? I\r\n  found her driven to the garret, through fear of the mob, who were\r\n  prowling round my house. And scarcely had I entered the house ere my\r\n  windows were broken in by the brickbats of the mob, and she so\r\n  alarmed that it was impossible for her to sleep or rest that night.\r\n  I am hunted as a partridge upon the mountains; I am pursued us a\r\n  felon through your streets; and to the guardian power of the law I\r\n  look in vain for that protection against violence which even the\r\n  vilest criminal may claim.\r\n\r\n  “Yet think not that I am unhappy. Think not that I regret the choice\r\n  that I have made. While all around me is violence and tumult, all is\r\n  peace within. An approving conscience, and the rewarding smile of\r\n  God, is a full recompense for all that I forego and all that I\r\n  endure. Yes, sir, I enjoy a peace which nothing can destroy. I sleep\r\n  sweetly and undisturbed, except when awaked by the brickbats of the\r\n  mob.\r\n\r\n  “No, sir, I am not unhappy. I have counted the cost, and stand\r\n  prepared freely to offer up my all in the service of God. Yes, sir,\r\n  I am fully aware of all the sacrifice I make, in here pledging\r\n  myself to continue this contest to the last.—(Forgive these tears—I\r\n  had not intended to shed them, and they flow not for myself but\r\n  others.) But I am commanded to forsake father and mother and wife\r\n  and children for Jesus’ sake; and as his professed disciple I stand\r\n  prepared to do it. The time for fulfilling this pledge in my case,\r\n  it seems to me, has come. Sir, I dare not flee away from Alton.\r\n  Should I attempt it, I should feel that the angel of the Lord, with\r\n  his flaming sword, was pursuing me wherever I went. It is because I\r\n  fear God that I am not afraid of all who oppose me in this city. No,\r\n  sir, the contest has commenced here; and here it must be finished.\r\n  Before God and you all, I here pledge myself to continue it, if need\r\n  be, till death. If I fall, my grave shall be made in Alton.”\r\n\r\nIn person Lovejoy was well formed, in voice and manners refined; and the\r\npathos of this last appeal, uttered in entire simplicity, melted every\r\none present, and produced a deep silence. It was one of those moments\r\nwhen the feelings of an audience tremble in the balance, and a grain may\r\nincline them to either side. A proposition to support him might have\r\ncarried, had it been made at that moment. The charm was broken by\r\nanother minister of the gospel, who rose and delivered a homily on the\r\nnecessity of compromise, recommending to Mr. Lovejoy especial attention\r\nto the example of Paul, who was let down in a basket from a window in\r\nDamascus; as if Alton had been a heathen city under a despotic\r\ngovernment! The charm once broken, the meeting became tumultuous and\r\nexcited, and all manner of denunciations were rained down upon\r\nabolitionists. The meeting passed the resolutions reported by the\r\ncommittee, and refused to resolve to aid in sustaining the law against\r\nillegal violence; and the mob perfectly understood that, do what they\r\nmight, they should have no disturbance. It being now understood that Mr.\r\nLovejoy would not retreat, it was supposed that the crisis of the matter\r\nwould develop itself when his printing-press came on shore.\r\n\r\nDuring the following three days there seemed to be something of a\r\nreäction. One of the most influential of the mob-leaders was heard to\r\nsay that it was of no use to go on destroying presses, as there was\r\nmoney enough on East to bring new ones, and that they might as well let\r\nthe fanatics alone.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat encouraged the irresolute city authorities, and the\r\nfriends of the press thought, if they could get it once landed, and safe\r\ninto the store of Messrs. Godfrey & Gilman, that the crisis would be\r\nsafely passed. They therefore sent an express to the captain to delay\r\nthe landing of the boat till three o’clock in the morning, and the\r\nleaders of the mob, after watching till they were tired, went home; the\r\npress was safely landed and deposited, and all supposed that the trouble\r\nwas safely passed. Under this impression Mr. Beecher left Alton, and\r\nreturned home.\r\n\r\nWe will give a few extracts from Mr. Beecher’s narrative, which describe\r\nhis last interview with Mr. Lovejoy on that night, after they had landed\r\nand secured the press:\r\n\r\n  Shortly after the hour fixed on for the landing of the boat, Mr.\r\n  Lovejoy arose, and called me to go with him to see what was the\r\n  result. The moon had set and it was still dark, but day was near;\r\n  and here and there a light was glimmering from the window of some\r\n  sick room, or of some early riser. The streets were empty and\r\n  silent, and the sounds of our feet echoed from the walls as we\r\n  passed along. Little did he dream, at that hour, of the contest\r\n  which the next night would witness; that these same streets would\r\n  echo with the shouts of an infuriate mob, and be stained with his\r\n  own heart’s blood.\r\n\r\n  We found the boat there, and the press in the warehouse; aided in\r\n  raising it to the third story. We were all rejoiced that no conflict\r\n  had ensued, and that the press was safe; and all felt that the\r\n  crisis was over. We were sure that the store could not be carried by\r\n  storm by so few men as had ever yet acted in a mob; and though the\r\n  majority of the citizens would not aid to defend the press, we had\r\n  no fear that they would aid in an attack. So deep was this feeling\r\n  that it was thought that a small number was sufficient to guard the\r\n  press afterward; and it was agreed that the company should be\r\n  divided into sections of six, and take turns on successive nights.\r\n  As they had been up all night, Mr. Lovejoy and myself offered to\r\n  take charge of the press till morning; and they retired.\r\n\r\n  The morning soon began to dawn; and that morning I shall never\r\n  forget. Who that has stood on the banks of the mighty stream that\r\n  then rolled before me can forget the emotions of sublimity that\r\n  filled his heart, as in imagination he has traced those channels of\r\n  intercourse opened by it and its branches through the illimitable\r\n  regions of this western world? I thought of future ages, and of the\r\n  countless millions that should dwell on this mighty stream; and that\r\n  nothing but the truth would make them free. Never did I feel as then\r\n  the value of the right for which we were contending thoroughly to\r\n  investigate and fearlessly to proclaim that truth. O, the sublimity\r\n  of moral power! By it God sways the universe. By it he will make the\r\n  nations free.\r\n\r\n  I passed through the scuttle to the roof, and ascended to the\r\n  highest point of the wall. The sky and the river were beginning to\r\n  glow with approaching day, and the busy hum of business to be heard.\r\n  I looked with exultation on the scenes below. I felt that a\r\n  bloodless battle had been gained for God and for the truth; and that\r\n  Alton was redeemed from eternal shame. And as all around grew\r\n  brighter with approaching day, I thought of that still brighter sun,\r\n  even now dawning on the world, and soon to bathe it with floods of\r\n  glorious light.\r\n\r\n  Brother Lovejoy, too, was happy. He did not exult; he was tranquil\r\n  and composed, but his countenance indicated the state of his mind.\r\n  It was a calm and tranquil joy, for he trusted in God that the point\r\n  was gained: that the banner of an unfettered press would soon wave\r\n  over that mighty stream.\r\n\r\n  Vain hopes! How soon to be buried in a martyr’s grave! Vain, did I\r\n  say? No: they are not vain. Though dead he still speaketh; and a\r\n  united world can never silence his voice.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the tragedy is briefly told. A volunteer company, of\r\nwhom Lovejoy was one, was formed to act under the mayor in defence of\r\nthe law. The next night the mob assailed the building at ten o’clock.\r\nThe store consisted of two stone buildings in one block, with doors and\r\nwindows at each end, but no windows at the sides. The roof was of wood.\r\nMr. Gilman, opening the end door of the third story, asked what they\r\nwanted. They demanded the press. He refused to give it up, and earnestly\r\nentreated them to go away without violence, assuring them that, as the\r\nproperty had been committed to their charge, they should defend it at\r\nthe risk of their lives. After some ineffectual attempts, the mob\r\nshouted to set fire to the roof. Mr. Lovejoy, with some others, went out\r\nto defend it from this attack, and was shot down by the deliberate aim\r\nof one of the mob. After this wound he had barely strength to return to\r\nthe store, went up one flight of stairs, fell and expired.\r\n\r\nThose within then attempted to capitulate, but were refused with curses\r\nby the mob, who threatened to burn the store, and shoot them as they\r\ncame out. At length the building was actually on fire, and they fled\r\nout, fired on as they went by the mob. So terminated the Alton tragedy.\r\n\r\nWhen the noble mother of Lovejoy heard of his death, she said, “It is\r\nwell. I had rather he would die so than forsake his principles.” All is\r\nnot over with America while such mothers are yet left. Was she not\r\nblessed who could give up such a son in such a spirit? Who was that\r\nwoman whom God pronounced blessed above all women? Was it not she who\r\nsaw her dearest crucified? So differently does God see from what man\r\nsees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n   SERVITUDE IN THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH COMPARED WITH AMERICAN SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n           “Look now upon _this_ picture!——and on _this_.”\r\n\r\n                                                     HAMLET.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the standing claim of those professors of religion at the South\r\nwho support slavery that they are pursuing the same course in relation\r\nto it that Christ and his apostles did. Let us consider the course of\r\nChrist and his apostles, and the nature of the kingdom which they\r\nfounded, and see if this be the fact.\r\n\r\nNapoleon said, “Alexander, Cæsar, Charlemagne and myself, have founded\r\nempires; but upon what did we rest the creation of our genius? Upon\r\nforce. Jesus Christ alone founded his empire upon LOVE.”\r\n\r\nThe desire to be above others in power, rank and station, is one of the\r\ndeepest in human nature. If there is anything which distinguishes man\r\nfrom other creatures, it is that he is _par excellence_ an _oppressive\r\nanimal_. On this principle, as Napoleon observed, all empires have been\r\nfounded; and the idea of founding a kingdom in any other way had not\r\neven been thought of when Jesus of Nazareth appeared.\r\n\r\nWhen the serene Galilean came up from the waters of Jordan, crowned and\r\nglorified by the descending Spirit, and began to preach, saying, “The\r\n_kingdom_ of God is at hand,” what expectations did he excite? Men’s\r\nheads were full of armies to be marshalled, of provinces to be\r\nconquered, of cabinets to be formed, and offices to be distributed.\r\nThere was no doubt at all that he could get all these things for them,\r\nfor had he not miraculous power?\r\n\r\nTherefore it was that Jesus of Nazareth was very popular, and drew\r\ncrowds after him.\r\n\r\nOf these, he chose, from the very lowest walk of life, twelve men of the\r\nbest and most honest heart which he could find, that he might make them\r\nhis inseparable companions, and mould them, by his sympathy and\r\nfriendship, into some capacity to receive and transmit his ideas to\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nBut they too, simple-hearted and honest though they were, were\r\nbewildered and bewitched by the common vice of mankind; and, though they\r\nloved him full well, still had an eye on the offices and ranks which he\r\nwas to confer, when, as they expected, this miraculous kingdom should\r\nblaze forth.\r\n\r\nWhile his heart was struggling and laboring, and nerving itself by\r\nnights of prayer to meet desertion, betrayal, denial, rejection, by his\r\nbeloved people, and ignominious death, _they_ were forever wrangling\r\nabout the offices in the new kingdom. Once and again, in the plainest\r\nway, he told them that no such thing was to be looked for; that there\r\nwas to be no distinction in his kingdom, except the distinction of pain,\r\nand suffering, and self-renunciation, voluntarily assumed for the good\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nHis words seemed to them as idle tales. In fact, they considered him as\r\na kind of a myth,—a mystery,—a strange, supernatural, inexplicable\r\nbeing, forever talking in parables, and saying things which they could\r\nnot understand.\r\n\r\nOne thing only they held fast to: he was a king, he would have a\r\nkingdom; and he had told them that they should sit on twelve thrones,\r\njudging the twelve tribes of Israel.\r\n\r\nAnd so, when he was going up to Jerusalem to die,—when that anguish long\r\nwrestled with in the distance had come, almost face to face, and he was\r\nwalking in front of them, silent, abstracted, speaking occasionally in\r\nbroken sentences, of which they feared to ask the meaning,—they, behind,\r\nbeguiled the time with the usual dispute of “who should be greatest.”\r\n\r\nThe mother of James and John came to him, and, breaking the mournful\r\ntrain of revery, desired a certain thing of him,—that her two sons might\r\nsit at his right hand and his left, as prime ministers, in the new\r\nkingdom. With his sad, far-seeing eye still fixed upon Gethsemane and\r\nCalvary, he said, “Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the\r\ncup which I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism\r\nwherewith I shall be baptized?”\r\n\r\nJames and John were both quite certain that they were able. They were\r\nwilling to fight through anything for the kingdom’s sake. The ten were\r\nvery indignant. Were they not as willing as James and John? And so there\r\nwas a contention among them.\r\n\r\n“But Jesus called them to him and said, Ye know that the princes of the\r\nGentiles exercise dominion over them, and their great ones exercise\r\nauthority upon them; but it shall not be so among you.\r\n\r\n“Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and\r\nwhosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant,—yea, the\r\nservant of all. For even the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto,\r\nbut to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.”\r\n\r\nLet us now pass on to another week in this history. The disciples have\r\nseen their Lord enter triumphantly into Jerusalem, amid the shouts of\r\nthe multitude. An indescribable something in his air and manner\r\nconvinces them that a great crisis is at hand. He walks among men as a\r\ndescended God. Never were his words so thrilling and energetic. Never\r\nwere words spoken on earth which so breathe and burn as these of the\r\nlast week of the life of Christ. All the fervor and imagery and fire of\r\nthe old prophets seemed to be raised from the dead, etherealized and\r\ntransfigured in the person of this Jesus. They dare not ask him, but\r\nthey are _certain_ that the kingdom must be coming. They feel, in the\r\nthrill of that mighty soul, that a great cycle of time is finishing, and\r\na new era in the world’s history beginning. Perhaps at this very feast\r\nof the Passover is the time when the miraculous banner is to be\r\nunfurled, and the new, immortal kingdom proclaimed. Again the ambitious\r\nlongings arise. This new kingdom shall have ranks and dignities. And who\r\nis to sustain them? While therefore their Lord sits lost in thought,\r\nrevolving in his mind that simple ordinance of love which he is about to\r\nconstitute the sealing ordinance of his kingdom, it is said again,\r\n“There was a strife among them which should be accounted the greatest.”\r\n\r\nThis time Jesus does not remonstrate. He expresses no impatience, no\r\nweariness, no disgust. What does he, then? Hear what St. John says:\r\n\r\n“Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and\r\nthat he was come from God and went to God, he riseth from supper, and\r\nlaid aside his garments, and took a towel and girded himself. After\r\nthat, he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples’\r\nfeet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.” “After\r\nhe had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was sat down\r\nagain, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me\r\nMaster and Lord: and ye say well, for so I am. If I, then, your Lord and\r\nMaster, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another’s feet;\r\nfor I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Verily, verily I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his\r\nlord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If ye know\r\nthese things, happy are ye if ye do them.”\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have the king, and the constitution of the kingdom. The\r\nking on his knees at the feet of his servants, performing the lowest\r\nmenial service, with the announcement, “I have given you an example,\r\nthat ye should do as I have done to you.”\r\n\r\nAnd when, after the descent of the Holy Ghost, all these immortal words\r\nof Christ, which had lain buried like dead seed in the heart, were\r\nquickened and sprang up in celestial verdure, then these twelve became,\r\neach one in his place, another Jesus, filled with the spirit of him who\r\nhad gone heavenward. The primitive church, as organized by them, was a\r\nbrotherhood of strict equality. There was no more contention who should\r\nbe greatest; the only contention was, who should suffer and serve the\r\nmost. The Christian church was an _imperium in imperio_; submitting\r\noutwardly to the laws of the land, but professing inwardly to be\r\nregulated by a higher faith and a higher law. They were dead to the\r\nworld, and the world to them. Its customs were not their customs; its\r\nrelations not their relations. All the ordinary relations of life, when\r\nthey passed into the Christian church, underwent a quick, immortal\r\nchange; so that the transformed relation resembled the old and heathen\r\none no more than the glorious body which is raised in incorruption\r\nresembles the mortal one which was sown in corruption. The relation of\r\nmarriage was changed, from a tyrannous dominion of the stronger sex over\r\nthe weaker, to an intimate union, symbolizing the relation of Christ and\r\nthe church. The relation of parent and child, purified from the harsh\r\nfeatures of heathen law, became a just image of the love of the heavenly\r\nFather; and the relation of master and servant, in like manner, was\r\nrefined into a voluntary relation between two equal brethren, in which\r\nthe servant faithfully performed his duties _as to the Lord_, and the\r\nmaster gave him a full compensation for his services.\r\n\r\nNo one ever doubted that such a relation as this is an innocent one. It\r\nexists in all free states. It is the relation which exists between\r\nemployer and employed generally, in the various departments of life. It\r\nis true, the master was never called upon to perform the legal act of\r\nenfranchisement,—and why? Because the very nature of the kingdom into\r\nwhich the master and slave had entered enfranchised him. It is not\r\nnecessary for a master to write a deed of enfranchisement when he takes\r\nhis slaves into Canada, or even into New York or Pennsylvania. The\r\nmoment the master and slave stand together on this soil, their whole\r\nrelations to each other are changed. The master may remain master, and\r\nthe servant a servant; but, according to the constitution of the state\r\nthey have entered, the service must be a voluntary one on the part of\r\nthe slave, and the master must render a just equivalent. When the water\r\nof baptism passed over the master and the slave, both alike came under\r\nthe great constitutional law of Christ’s empire, which is this:\r\n\r\n“Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and\r\nwhosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant, yea, the\r\nservant of all.” Under such a law, servitude was dignified and made\r\nhonorable, but slavery was made an impossibility.\r\n\r\nThat the church was essentially, and in its own nature, such an\r\ninstitution of equality, brotherhood, love and liberty, as made the\r\nexistence of a slave, in the character of a slave, in it, a\r\ncontradiction and an impossibility, is evident from the general scope\r\nand tendency of all the apostolic writings, particularly those of Paul.\r\n\r\nAnd this view is obtained, not from a dry analysis of Greek words, and\r\ndismal discussions about the meaning of _doulos_, but from a full tide\r\nof celestial, irresistible spirit, full of life and love, that breathes\r\nin every description of the Christian church.\r\n\r\nTo all, whether bond or free, the apostle addresses these inspiring\r\nwords: “There is one body, and one spirit, even as ye are called in one\r\nhope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and\r\nFather of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.” “For\r\nthrough him we all have access, by one Spirit, unto the Father.” “Now,\r\ntherefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens\r\nwith the saints, and of the household of God, and are built upon the\r\nfoundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ, himself, being\r\nthe chief corner-stone.” “Ye are all the children of God, by faith in\r\nJesus Christ; there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor\r\nfree, there is neither male nor female, for ye are all one in Christ\r\nJesus.”\r\n\r\n“For, as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of\r\nthat one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ; for by one\r\nSpirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or\r\nGentiles, whether we be bond or free; and whether one member suffer, all\r\nthe members suffer with it, or one member be honored, all the members\r\nrejoice with it.”\r\n\r\nIt was the theory of this blessed and divine unity, that whatever gift,\r\nor superiority, or advantage, was possessed by one member, was possessed\r\nby every member. Thus Paul says to them, “All things are yours; whether\r\nPaul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or life, or death, all are yours, and ye\r\nare Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus represented the church as one living body, inseparably\r\nunited, the apostle uses a still more awful and impressive simile. The\r\nchurch, he says, is one body, and that body is the fulness of Him who\r\nfilleth all in all. That is, He who filleth all in all seeks this church\r\nto be the associate and complement of himself, even as a wife is of the\r\nhusband. This body of believers is spoken of as a bright and mystical\r\nbride, in the world, but not of it; spotless, divine, immortal, raised\r\nfrom the death of sin to newness of life, redeemed by the blood of her\r\nLord, and to be presented at last unto him, a glorious church, not\r\nhaving spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.\r\n\r\nA delicate and mysterious sympathy is supposed to pervade this church,\r\nlike that delicate and mysterious tracery of nerves that overspreads the\r\nhuman body; the meanest member cannot suffer without the whole body\r\nquivering in pain. Thus says Paul, who was himself a perfect realization\r\nof this beautiful theory: “Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is\r\noffended, and I burn not?” “To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive\r\nalso.”\r\n\r\nBut still further, individual Christians were reminded, in language of\r\nawful solemnity, “What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the\r\nHoly Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God, and that ye are not\r\nyour own?” And again, “Ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath\r\nsaid, I will dwell in them and walk in them.” Nor was this sublime\r\nlanguage in those days passed over as a mere idle piece of rhetoric, but\r\nwas the ever-present consciousness of the soul.\r\n\r\nEvery Christian was made an object of sacred veneration to his brethren,\r\nas the temple of the living God. The soul of every Christian was hushed\r\ninto awful stillness, and inspired to carefulness, watchfulness and\r\nsanctity, by the consciousness of an indwelling God. Thus Ignatius, who\r\nfor his preëminent piety was called, _par excellence_, by his church,\r\n“Theophorus, _the_ God-bearer,” when summoned before the Emperor Trajan,\r\nused the following remarkable language: “No one can call Theophorus an\r\nevil spirit * * * * for, bearing in my heart Christ the king of heaven,\r\nI bring to nothing the arts and devices of the evil spirits.”\r\n\r\n“Who, then, is ‘the God-bearer’?” asked Trajan.\r\n\r\n“He who carries Christ in his heart,” was the reply. * * * *\r\n\r\n“Dost thou mean him whom Pontius Pilate crucified?”\r\n\r\n“He is the one I mean,” replied Ignatius. * * *\r\n\r\n“Dost thou then bear the crucified one in thy heart?” asked Trajan.\r\n\r\n“Even so,” said Ignatius; “for it is written, ‘I will dwell in them and\r\nrest in them.’”\r\n\r\nSo perfect was the identification of Christ with the individual\r\nChristian in the primitive church, that it was a familiar form of\r\nexpression to speak of an injury done to the meanest Christian as an\r\ninjury done to Christ. So St. Paul says, “When ye sin so against the\r\nweak brethren, and wound their weak consciences, ye sin against Christ.”\r\nHe says of himself, “I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.”\r\n\r\nSee, also, the following extracts from a letter by Cyprian, Bishop of\r\nCarthage, to some poor Numidian churches, who had applied to him to\r\nredeem some of their members from slavery among bordering savage tribes.\r\n(Neander Denkw. I. 340.)\r\n\r\n  We could view the captivity of our brethren no otherwise than as our\r\n  own, since we belong to one body, and not only love, but religion,\r\n  excites us to redeem in our brethren the members of our own body. We\r\n  must, even if affection were not sufficient to induce us to keep our\r\n  brethren,—we must reflect that the temples of God are in captivity,\r\n  and these temples of God ought not, by our neglect, long to remain\r\n  in bondage. * * *\r\n\r\n  Since the apostle says “as many of you as are baptized have put on\r\n  Christ,” so in our captive brethren we must see before us CHRIST,\r\n  who hath ransomed us from the danger of captivity, who hath redeemed\r\n  us from the danger of death; _Him_ who hath freed us from the abyss\r\n  of Satan, and who now remains and dwells in us, to free _Him_ from\r\n  the hands of barbarians! With a small sum of money to ransom _Him_\r\n  who hath ransomed us by his cross and blood; and who hath permitted\r\n  this to take place that our faith may be proved thereby!\r\n\r\nNow, because the Greek word _doulos_ may mean a slave, and because it is\r\nevident that there were men in the Christian church who were called\r\n_douloi_, will anybody say, in the whole face and genius of this\r\nbeautiful institution, that these men were held actually as slaves in\r\nthe sense of Roman and American law? Of all dry, dull, hopeless\r\nstupidities, this is the most stupid. Suppose Christian masters did have\r\nservants who were called _douloi_, as is plain enough they did, is it\r\nnot evident that the word _douloi_ had become significant of something\r\nvery different in the Christian church from what it meant in Roman law?\r\nIt was not the business of the apostles to make new dictionaries; they\r\ndid not change words,—they changed things. The baptized, regenerated,\r\nnew-created _doulos_, of one body and one spirit with his master, made\r\none with his master, even as Christ is one with the Father, a member\r\nwith him of that church which is the fulness of Him who filleth all in\r\nall,—was his relation to his Christian master like that of an American\r\nslave to his master? Would he who regarded his weakest brother as being\r\none with Christ hold his brother as a chattel personal? Could he hold\r\nChrist as a chattel personal? Could he sell Christ for money? Could he\r\nhold the temple of the Holy Ghost as his property, and gravely defend\r\nhis right to sell, lease, mortgage or hire the same, at his convenience,\r\nas that right has been argued in the slave-holding pulpits of America?\r\n\r\nWhat would have been said at such a doctrine announced in the Christian\r\nchurch? Every member would have stopped his ears, and cried out,\r\n“Judas!” If he was pronounced accursed who thought that the gift of the\r\nHoly Ghost might be purchased with money, what would have been said of\r\nhim who held that the very temple of the Holy Ghost might be bought and\r\nsold, and Christ the Lord become an article of merchandise? Such an idea\r\nnever was thought of. It could not have been refuted, for it never\r\nexisted. It was an unheard-of and unsupposable work of the devil, which\r\nPaul never contemplated as even possible, that one Christian could claim\r\na right to hold another Christian as merchandise, and to trade in the\r\n“member of the body, flesh and bones” of Christ. Such a horrible\r\ndoctrine never polluted the innocence of the Christian church even in\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nThe directions which Paul gives to Christian masters and servants\r\nsufficiently show what a redeeming change had passed over the\r\ninstitution. In 1st Timothy, St. Paul gives the following directions,\r\nfirst to those who have heathen masters, second, to those who have\r\nChristian masters. That concerning heathen masters is thus expressed:\r\n“Let as many servants as are under the _yoke_ count their own masters\r\nworthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not\r\nblasphemed.” In the next verse the direction is given to the servants of\r\nChristian masters: “They that have believing masters, let them not\r\ndespise them because they are brethren, but rather do them service\r\nbecause they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit.”\r\nNotice, now, the contrast between these directions. The servant of the\r\nheathen master is said to be under the yoke, and it is evidently implied\r\nthat the servant of the Christian master was not under the yoke. The\r\nservant of the heathen master was under the severe Roman law; the\r\nservant of the Christian master is an equal, and a brother. In these\r\ncircumstances, the servant of the heathen master is commanded to obey\r\nfor the sake of recommending the Christian religion. The servant of the\r\nChristian master, on the other hand, is commanded not to despise his\r\nmaster because he is his brother; but he is to do him service because\r\nhis master is faithful and beloved, a partaker of the same glorious\r\nhopes with himself. Let us suppose, now, a clergyman, employed as a\r\nchaplain on a cotton plantation, where most of the members on the\r\nplantation, as we are informed is sometimes the case, are members of the\r\nsame Christian church as their master, should assemble the hands around\r\nhim and say, “Now, boys, I would not have you despise your master\r\nbecause he is your brother. It is true you are all one in Christ Jesus;\r\nthere is no distinction here; there is neither Jew nor Greek, neither\r\nnegro nor white man, neither bond nor free, but ye are all brethren,—all\r\nalike members of Christ, and heirs of the same kingdom; but you must not\r\ndespise your master on this account. You must love him as a brother, and\r\nbe willing to do all you can to serve him; because you see he is a\r\npartaker of the same benefit with you, and the Lord loves him as much as\r\nhe does you.” Would not such an address create a certain degree of\r\nastonishment both with master and servants; and does not the fact that\r\nit seems absurd show that the relation of the slave to his master in\r\nAmerican law is a very different one from what it was in the Christian\r\nchurch? But again, let us quote another passage, which slave-owners are\r\nmuch more fond of. In Colossians 4:22 and 5:1,—“Servants, obey, in all\r\nthings, your masters, according to the flesh; not with eye-service as\r\nmen-pleasers, but in singleness of heart as fearing God; and whatsoever\r\nye do, do it heartily as unto the Lord, and not unto men, knowing that\r\nof the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance, for ye serve\r\nthe Lord Christ.” “Masters, give unto servants that which is just and\r\nequal, knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.”\r\n\r\nNow, there is nothing in these directions to servants which would show\r\nthat they were chattel servants in the sense of slave-law; for they will\r\napply equally well to every servant in Old England and New England; but\r\nthere is something in the direction to masters which shows that they\r\nwere not considered chattel servants by the church, because the master\r\nis commanded to give unto them that which is just and equal, as a\r\nconsideration for their service. Of the words “just and equal,” “just”\r\nmeans that which is legally theirs, and “equal” means that which is in\r\nitself equitable, irrespective of law.\r\n\r\nNow, we have the undoubted testimony of all legal authorities on\r\nAmerican slave-law that American slavery does not _pretend_ to be\r\nfounded on what is just or equal either. Thus Judge Ruffin says: “Merely\r\nin the abstract it may well be asked which power of the master accords\r\nwith right. The answer will probably sweep away all of them;” and this\r\nprinciple, so unequivocally asserted by Judge Ruffin, is all along\r\nimplied and taken for granted, as we have just seen, in all the\r\nreasonings upon slavery and the slave-law. It would take very little\r\nlegal acumen to see that the enacting of these words of Paul into a\r\nstatute by any state would be a practical abolition of slavery in that\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nBut it is said that St. Paul sent Onesimus back to his master. Indeed!\r\nbut _how_? When, to our eternal shame and disgrace, the horrors of the\r\nfugitive slave-law were being enacted in Boston, and the very Cradle of\r\nLiberty resounded with the groans of the slave, and men harder-hearted\r\nthan Saul of Tarsus made havoc of the church, entering into every house,\r\nhaling men and women, committing them to prison; when whole churches of\r\nhumble Christians were broken up and scattered like flocks of trembling\r\nsheep; when husbands and fathers were torn from their families, and\r\nmothers, with poor, helpless children, fled at midnight, with bleeding\r\nfeet, through snow and ice, towards Canada;—in the midst of these\r\nscenes, which have made America a by-word and a hissing and an\r\nastonishment among all nations, there were found men, Christian men,\r\nministers of the gospel of Jesus, even,—alas! that this should ever be\r\nwritten,—who, standing in the pulpit, in the name and by the authority\r\nof Christ, justified and sanctioned these enormities, and used this most\r\nloving and simple-hearted letter of the martyr Paul to justify these\r\nunheard-of atrocities!\r\n\r\nHe who said, “Who is weak and I am not weak? Who is offended and I burn\r\nnot?”—he who called the converted slave his own body, the son begotten\r\nin his bonds, and who sent him to the brother of his soul with the\r\ndirection, “Receive him as myself, not now as a slave, but above a\r\nslave, a brother beloved,”—this beautiful letter, this outgush of\r\ntenderness and love passing the love of woman, was held up to be pawed\r\nover by the polluted hobgoblin-fingers of slave-dealers and\r\nslave-whippers as their _lettre de cachet_, signed and sealed in the\r\nname of Christ and his apostles, giving full authority to carry back\r\nslaves to be tortured and whipped, and sold into perpetual bondage, as\r\nwere Henry Long and Thomas Sims! Just as well might a mother’s letter,\r\nwhen, with prayers and tears, she commits her first and only child to\r\nthe cherishing love and sympathy of some trusted friend, be used as an\r\ninquisitor’s warrant for inflicting imprisonment and torture upon that\r\nchild. Had not every fragment of the apostle’s body long since mouldered\r\nto dust, his very bones would have moved in their grave, in protest\r\nagainst such slander on the Christian name and faith. And is it come to\r\nthis. O Jesus Christ! have such things been done in thy name, and art\r\nthou silent yet? Verily, thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of\r\nIsrael, the Saviour!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut why did not the apostles preach against the legal relation of\r\nslavery, and seek its overthrow in the state? This question is often\r\nargued as if the apostles were in the same condition with the clergy of\r\nSouthern churches, members of republican institutions, law-makers, and\r\npossessed of all republican powers to agitate for the repeal of unjust\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nContrary to all this, a little reading of the New Testament will show us\r\nthat the apostles were almost in the condition of outlaws, under a\r\nsevere and despotic government, whose spirit and laws they reprobated as\r\nunchristian, and to which they submitted, just as they exhorted the\r\nslave to submit, as to a necessary evil.\r\n\r\nHear the apostle Paul thus enumerating the political privileges incident\r\nto the ministry of Christ. Some false teachers had risen in the church\r\nat Corinth, and controverted his teachings, asserting that they had\r\ngreater pretensions to authority in the Christian ministry than he. St.\r\nPaul, defending his apostolic position, thus speaks: “Are they ministers\r\nof Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labors more abundant, in\r\nstripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the\r\nJews five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten\r\nwith rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a\r\nday have I been in the deep; in journeyings often, in perils of waters,\r\nin perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the\r\nheathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils\r\nin the sea, in perils among false brethren: in weariness and\r\npainfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings\r\noften, in cold and nakedness.”\r\n\r\nWhat enumeration of the hardships of an American slave can more than\r\nequal the hardships of the great apostle to the Gentiles? He had nothing\r\nto do with laws except to suffer their penalties. They were made and\r\nkept in operation without asking him, and the slave did not suffer any\r\nmore from them than he did.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the clergymen of the South, when they imitate the\r\nexample of Paul, in letting entirely alone the civil relation of the\r\nslave, have left wholly out of their account how different is the\r\nposition of an American clergyman, in a republican government, where he\r\nhimself helps make and sustain the laws, from the condition of the\r\napostle, under a heathen despotism, with whose laws he could have\r\nnothing to do.\r\n\r\nIt is very proper for an outlawed slave to address to other outlawed\r\nslaves exhortations to submit to a government which neither he nor they\r\nhave any power to alter.\r\n\r\nWe read, in sermons which clergymen at the South have addressed to\r\nslaves, exhortations to submission, and patience, and humility, in their\r\nenslaved condition, which would be exceedingly proper in the mouth of an\r\napostle, where he and the slaves were alike fellow-sufferers under a\r\ndespotism whose laws they could not alter, but which assume quite\r\nanother character when addressed to the slave by the very men who make\r\nthe laws that enslave them.\r\n\r\nIf a man has been waylaid and robbed of all his property, it would be\r\nvery becoming and proper for his clergyman to endeavor to reconcile him\r\nto his condition, as, in some sense, a dispensation of Providence; but\r\nif the man who robs him should come to him, and address to him the same\r\nexhortations, he certainly will think that that is quite another phase\r\nof the matter.\r\n\r\nA clergyman of high rank in the church, in a sermon to the negroes, thus\r\naddresses them:\r\n\r\n  Almighty God hath been pleased to make you slaves here, and to give\r\n  you nothing but labor and poverty in this world, which you are\r\n  obliged to submit to, as it is his will that it should be so. And\r\n  think within yourselves what a terrible thing it would be, after all\r\n  your labors and sufferings in this life, to be turned into hell in\r\n  the next life; and, after wearing out your bodies in service here,\r\n  to go into a far worse slavery when this is over, and your poor\r\n  souls be delivered over into the possession of the devil, to become\r\n  his slaves forever in hell, without any hope of ever getting free\r\n  from it. If, therefore, you would be God’s freemen in heaven, you\r\n  must strive to be good and serve him here on earth. Your bodies, you\r\n  know, are not your own; they are at the disposal of those you belong\r\n  to; but your precious souls are still your own, which nothing can\r\n  take from you, if it be not your own fault. Consider well, then,\r\n  that if you lose your souls by leading idle, wicked lives here, you\r\n  have got nothing by it in this world, and you have lost your all in\r\n  the next. For your idleness and wickedness is generally found out,\r\n  and your bodies suffer for it here; and, what is far worse, if you\r\n  do not repent and amend, your unhappy souls will suffer for it\r\n  hereafter.\r\n\r\nNow, this clergyman was a man of undoubted sincerity. He had read the\r\nNew Testament, and observed that St. Paul addressed exhortations\r\nsomething like this to slaves in his day.\r\n\r\nBut he entirely forgot to consider that Paul had not the rights of a\r\nrepublican clergyman; that he was not a maker and sustainer of those\r\nlaws by which the slaves were reduced to their condition, but only a\r\nfellow-sufferer under them. A case may be supposed which would\r\nillustrate this principle to the clergyman. Suppose that he were\r\ntravelling along the highway, with all his worldly property about him,\r\nin the shape of bank-bills. An association of highwaymen seize him, bind\r\nhim to a tree, and take away the whole of his worldly estate. This they\r\nwould have precisely the same right to do that the clergyman and his\r\nbrother republicans have to take all the earnings and possessions of\r\ntheir slaves. The property would belong to these highwaymen by exactly\r\nthe same kind of title,—not because they have earned it, but simply\r\nbecause they have got it and are able to keep it.\r\n\r\nThe head of this confederation, observing some dissatisfaction upon the\r\nface of the clergyman, proceeds to address him a religious exhortation\r\nto patience and submission, in much the same terms as he had before\r\naddressed to the slaves. “Almighty God has been pleased to take away\r\nyour entire property, and to give you nothing but labor and poverty in\r\nthis world, which you are obliged to submit to, as it is his will that\r\nit should be so. Now, think within yourself what a terrible thing it\r\nwould be, if, having lost all your worldly property, you should, by\r\ndiscontent and want of resignation, lose also your soul; and, having\r\nbeen robbed of all your property here, to have your poor soul delivered\r\nover to the possession of the devil, to become his property forever in\r\nhell, without any hope of ever getting free from it. Your property now\r\nis no longer your own; we have taken possession of it; but your precious\r\nsoul is still your own, and nothing can take it from you but your own\r\nfault. Consider well, then, that if you lose your soul by rebellion and\r\nmurmuring against this dispensation of Providence, you will get nothing\r\nby it in this world, and will lose your all in the next.”\r\n\r\nNow, should this clergyman say, as he might very properly, to these\r\nrobbers,—“There is no necessity for my being poor in this world, if you\r\nwill only give me back my property which you have taken from me,” he is\r\nonly saying precisely what the slaves to whom he has been preaching\r\nmight say to him and his fellow-republicans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it may still be said that the apostles might have commanded\r\nChristian masters to perform the act of legal emancipation in all cases.\r\nCertainly they might, and it is quite evident that they did not.\r\n\r\nThe professing primitive Christian regarded and treated his slave as a\r\nbrother, but in the eye of the law he was still his chattel personal,—a\r\nthing, and not a man. Why did not the apostles, then, strike at the\r\nlegal relation? Why did they not command every Christian convert to\r\nsunder that chain at once? In answer, we say that every attempt at\r\nreform which comes from God has proceeded uniformly in this manner,—to\r\ndestroy the _spirit_ of an abuse first, and leave the _form_ of it to\r\ndrop away, of itself, afterwards,—to girdle the poisonous tree, and\r\nleave it to take its own time for dying.\r\n\r\nThis mode of dealing with abuses has this advantage, that it is\r\ncompendious and universal, and can apply to that particular abuse in all\r\nages, and under all shades and modifications. If the apostle, in that\r\noutward and physical age, had merely attacked the legal relation, and\r\nhad rested the whole burden of obligation on dissolving that, the\r\ncorrupt and selfish principle might have run into other forms of\r\noppression equally bad, and sheltered itself under the technicality of\r\navoiding legal slavery. God, therefore, dealt a surer blow at the\r\nmonster, by singling out the precise spot where his heart beat, and\r\nsaying to his apostles, “Strike there!”\r\n\r\nInstead of saying to the slave-holder, “manumit your slave,” it said to\r\nhim. “treat him as your brother,” and left to the slave-holder’s\r\nconscience to say how much was implied in this command.\r\n\r\nIn the directions which Paul gave about slavery, it is evident that he\r\nconsidered the legal relation with the same indifference with which a\r\ngardener treats a piece of unsightly bark, which he perceives the\r\ngrowing vigor of a young tree is about to throw off by its own vital\r\nforce. He looked upon it as a part of an old, effete system of\r\nheathenism, belonging to a set of laws and usages which were waxing old\r\nand ready to vanish away.\r\n\r\nThere is an argument which has been much employed on this subject, and\r\nwhich is specious. It is this. That the apostles treated slavery as one\r\nof the lawful relations of life, like that of parent and child, husband\r\nand wife.\r\n\r\nThe argument is thus stated: The apostles found all the relations of\r\nlife much corrupted by various abuses.\r\n\r\nThey did not attack the _relations_, but reformed the _abuses_, and thus\r\nrestored the relations to a healthy state.\r\n\r\nThe mistake here lies in assuming that slavery is the lawful relation.\r\nSlavery is the corruption of a lawful relation. The lawful relation is\r\n_servitude_, and slavery is the _corruption_ of servitude.\r\n\r\nWhen the apostles came, all the relations of life in the Roman empire\r\nwere thoroughly permeated with the principle of slavery. The relation of\r\nchild to parent was slavery. The relation of wife to husband was\r\nslavery. The relation of servant to master was slavery.\r\n\r\nThe power of the father over his son, by Roman law, was very much the\r\nsame with the power of the master over his slave.[30] He could, at his\r\npleasure, scourge, imprison, or put him to death. The son could possess\r\nnothing but what was the property of his father; and this unlimited\r\ncontrol extended through the whole lifetime of the father, unless the\r\nson were formally liberated by an act of manumission three times\r\nrepeated, while the slave could be manumitted by performing the act only\r\nonce. Neither was there any law obliging the father to manumit;—he could\r\nretain this power, if he chose, during his whole life.\r\n\r\nVery similar was the situation of the Roman wife. In case she were\r\naccused of crime, her husband assembled a meeting of her relations, and\r\nin their presence sat in judgment upon her, awarding such punishment as\r\nhe thought proper.\r\n\r\nFor unfaithfulness to her marriage-vow, or for drinking wine, Romulus\r\nallowed her husband to put her to death.[31] From this slavery, unlike\r\nthe son, the wife could never be manumitted; no legal forms were\r\nprovided. It was lasting as her life.\r\n\r\nThe same spirit of force and slavery pervaded the relation of master and\r\nservant, giving rise to that severe code of slave-law, which, with a few\r\nfeatures of added cruelty, Christian America, in the nineteenth century,\r\nhas reënacted.\r\n\r\nWith regard, now, to all these abuses of proper relations, the gospel\r\npursued one uniform course. It did not command the Christian father to\r\nperform the legal act of emancipation to his son; but it infused such a\r\ndivine spirit into the paternal relation, by assimilating it to the\r\nrelation of the heavenly Father, that the Christianized Roman would\r\nregard any use of his barbarous and oppressive legal powers as entirely\r\ninconsistent with his Christian profession. So it ennobled the marriage\r\nrelation by comparing it to the relation between Christ and his church;\r\ncommanding the husband to love his wife, even as Christ loved the\r\nchurch, and gave himself for it. It said to him, “No man ever yet hated\r\nhis own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the\r\nchurch;” “so ought every one to love his wife, even as himself.” Not an\r\nallusion is made to the barbarous, unjust power which the law gave the\r\nhusband. It was perfectly understood that a Christian husband could not\r\nmake use of it in conformity with these directions.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner Christian masters were exhorted to give to their\r\nservants that which is just and equitable; and, so far from coercing\r\ntheir services by force, to forbear even threatenings. The Christian\r\nmaster was directed to receive his Christianized slave, “NOT now as a\r\nslave, but above a slave, a brother beloved;” and, as in all these other\r\ncases, nothing was said to him about the barbarous powers which the\r\nRoman law gave him, since it was perfectly understood that he could not\r\nat the same time treat him as a brother beloved and as a slave in the\r\nsense of Roman law.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the question is asked, why did not the apostles seek\r\nthe abolition of slavery, we answer, they did seek it. They sought it by\r\nthe safest, shortest, and most direct course which could possibly have\r\nbeen adopted.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  See Adams’ Roman Antiquities.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  Dionys, Hal. II. 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut did Christianity abolish slavery as a matter of fact? We answer, it\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nLet us look at these acknowledged facts. At the time of the coming of\r\nChrist, slavery extended over the whole civilized world. Captives in war\r\nwere uniformly made slaves, and, as wars were of constant occurrence,\r\nthe ranks of slavery were continually being reinforced; and, as slavery\r\nwas hereditary and perpetual, there was every reason to suppose that the\r\nnumber would have gone on increasing indefinitely, had not some\r\ninfluence operated to stop it. This is one fact.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at another. At the time of the Reformation,\r\nchattel-slavery had entirely ceased throughout all the civilized\r\ncountries of the world;—by no particular edict, by no special laws of\r\nemancipation, but by the steady influence of some gradual, unseen power,\r\nthis whole vast system had dissolved away, like the snow-banks of\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThese two facts being conceded, the inquiry arises, What caused this\r\nchange? If, now, we find that the most powerful organization in the\r\ncivilized world at that time did pursue a system of measures which had a\r\ndirect tendency to bring about such a result, we shall very naturally\r\nascribe it to that organization.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish writer, Balmes, in his work entitled “Protestantism compared\r\nwith Catholicity,” has one chapter devoted to the anti-slavery course of\r\nthe church, in which he sets forth the whole system of measures which\r\nthe church pursued in reference to this subject, and quotes, in their\r\norder, all the decrees of councils. The decrees themselves are given in\r\nan appendix at length, in the original Latin. We cannot but sympathize\r\ndeeply in the noble and generous spirit in which these chapters are\r\nwritten, and the enlarged and vigorous ideas which they give of the\r\nmagnanimous and honorable nature of Christianity. They are evidently\r\nconceived by a large and noble soul, capable of understanding such\r\nviews,—a soul grave, earnest, deeply religious, though evidently\r\npenetrated and imbued with the most profound conviction of the truth of\r\nhis own peculiar faith.\r\n\r\nWe shall give a short abstract, from M. Balmes, of the early course of\r\nthe church. In contemplating the course which the church took in this\r\nperiod, certain things are to be borne in _mind_ respecting the\r\ncharacter of the times.\r\n\r\nThe process was carried on during that stormy and convulsed period of\r\nsociety which succeeded the breaking up of the Roman empire. At this\r\ntime, all the customs of society were rude and barbarous. Though\r\nChristianity, as a system, had been nominally very extensively embraced,\r\nyet it had not, as in the case of its first converts, penetrated to the\r\nheart, and regenerated the whole nature. Force and violence was the\r\norder of the day, and the Christianity of the savage northern tribes,\r\nwho at this time became masters of Europe, was mingled with the\r\nbarbarities of their ancient heathenism. To root the institution of\r\nslavery out of such a state of society, required, of course, a very\r\ndifferent process from what would be necessary under the enlightened\r\norganization of modern times.\r\n\r\nNo power but one of the peculiar kind which the Christian church then\r\npossessed could have effected anything in this way. The Christian church\r\nat this time, far from being in the outcast and outlawed state in which\r\nit existed in the time of the apostles, was now an organization of great\r\npower, and of a kind of power peculiarly adapted to that rude and\r\nuncultured age. It laid hold of all those elements of fear, and mystery,\r\nand superstition, which are strongest in barbarous ages, as with\r\nbarbarous individuals, and it visited the violations of its commands\r\nwith penalties the more dreaded that they related to some awful future,\r\ndimly perceived and imperfectly comprehended.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with slavery, the church did not commence by a proclamation\r\nof universal emancipation, because, such was the barbarous and unsettled\r\nnature of the times, so fierce the grasp of violence, and so many the\r\ncauses of discord, that she avoided adding to the confusion by infusing\r\ninto it this element;—nay, a certain council of the church forbade, on\r\npain of ecclesiastical censure, those who preached that slaves ought\r\nimmediately to leave their masters.\r\n\r\nThe course was commenced first by restricting the power of the master,\r\nand granting protection to the slave. The Council of Orleans, in 549,\r\ngave to a slave threatened with punishment the privilege of taking\r\nsanctuary in a church, and forbade his master to withdraw him thence,\r\nwithout taking a solemn oath that he would do him no harm; and, if he\r\nviolated the spirit of this oath, he was to be suspended from the church\r\nand the sacraments,—a doom which in those days was viewed with such a\r\ndegree of superstitious awe, that the most barbarous would scarcely dare\r\nto incur it. The custom was afterwards introduced of requiring an oath\r\non such occasions, not only that the slave should be free from corporeal\r\ninfliction, but that he should not be punished by an extra imposition of\r\nlabor, or by any badge of disgrace. When this was complained of, as\r\nbeing altogether too great a concession on the side of the slave, the\r\nutmost that could be extorted from the church, by way of retraction, was\r\nthis,—that in cases of very _heinous offence_ the master should not be\r\nrequired to make the two latter promises.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain punishment among the Goths which was more dreaded\r\nthan death. It was the shaving of the hair. This was considered as\r\ninflicting a lasting disgrace. If a Goth once had his hair shaved, it\r\nwas all over with him. The fifteenth canon of the Council of Merida, in\r\n666, forbade ecclesiastics to inflict this punishment upon their slaves,\r\nas also all other kind of violence, and ordained that if a slave\r\ncommitted an offence, he should not be subject to private vengeance, but\r\nbe delivered up to the secular tribunal, and that the bishops should use\r\ntheir power only to procure a moderation of the sentence. This was\r\nsubstituting public justice for personal vengeance—a most important\r\nstep. The church further enacted, by two councils, that the master who,\r\nof his own authority, should take the life of his slave, should be cut\r\noff for two years from the communion of the church,—a condition, in the\r\nview of those times, implying the most awful spiritual risk, separating\r\nthe man in the eye of society from all that was sacred, and teaching him\r\nto regard himself, and others to regard him, as a being loaded with the\r\nweight of a must tremendous sin.\r\n\r\nBesides the protection given to life and limb, the church threw her\r\nshield over the family condition of the slave. By old Roman law, the\r\nslave could not contract a legal, inviolable marriage. The church of\r\nthat age availed itself of the catholic idea of the sacramental nature\r\nof marriage to conflict with this heathenish doctrine. Pope Adrian I.\r\nsaid, “According to the words of the apostle, as in Jesus Christ we\r\nought not to deprive either slaves or freemen of the sacraments of the\r\nchurch so it is not allowed in any way to prevent the _marriage_ of\r\nslaves; and if their marriages have been contracted _in spite of the\r\nopposition and repugnance of their masters_, nevertheless they _ought\r\nnot to be dissolved_.” St. Thomas was of the same opinion, for he openly\r\nmaintains that, with respect to contracting marriage, “_slaves are not\r\nobliged to obey their masters_.”\r\n\r\nIt can easily be seen what an effect was produced when the personal\r\nsafety and family ties of the slaves were thus proclaimed sacred by an\r\nauthority which no man living dared dispute. It elevated the slave in\r\nthe eyes of his master, and awoke hope and self-respect in his own\r\nbosom, and powerfully tended to fit him for the reception of that\r\nliberty to which the church by many avenues was constantly seeking to\r\nconduct him.\r\n\r\nAnother means which the church used to procure emancipation was a\r\njealous care of the freedom of those already free.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows how in our Southern States the boundaries of slavery are\r\ncontinually increasing, for want of some power there to perform the same\r\nkind office. The liberated slave, travelling without his papers, is\r\ncontinually in danger of being taken up, thrown into jail, and sold to\r\npay his jail-fees. He has no bishop to help him out of his troubles. In\r\nno church can he take sanctuary. Hundreds and thousands of helpless men\r\nand women are every year engulfed in slavery in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe church, at this time, took all enfranchised slaves under her\r\nparticular protection. The act of enfranchisement was made a religious\r\nservice, and was solemnly performed in the church; and then the church\r\nreceived the newly-made freeman to her protecting arms, and guarded his\r\nnewly-acquired rights by her spiritual power. The first Council of\r\nOrange, held in 441, ordained in its seventh canon that the church\r\nshould check by ecclesiastical censures whoever desired to reduce to any\r\nkind of servitude slaves who had been emancipated within the enclosure\r\nof the church. A century later, the same prohibition was repeated in the\r\nseventh canon of the fifth Council of Orleans, held in 549. The\r\nprotection given by the church to freed slaves was so manifest and known\r\nto all, that the custom was introduced of especially recommending them\r\nto her, either in lifetime or by will. The Council of Agde, in\r\nLanguedoc, passed a resolution commanding the church, in all cases of\r\nnecessity, to undertake the defence of those to whom their masters had,\r\nin a lawful way, given liberty.\r\n\r\nAnother anti-slavery measure which the church pursued with distinguished\r\nzeal had the same end in view, that is, the _prevention of the increase\r\nof slavery_. It was the ransoming of captives. As at that time it was\r\ncustomary for captives in war to be made slaves of, unless ransomed, and\r\nas, owing to the unsettled state of society, wars were frequent, slavery\r\nmight have been indefinitely prolonged, had not the church made the\r\ngreatest efforts in this way. The ransoming of slaves in those days held\r\nthe same place in the affections of pious and devoted members of the\r\nchurch that the enterprise of converting the heathen now does. Many of\r\nthe most eminent Christians, in their excess of zeal, even sold\r\nthemselves into captivity that they might redeem distressed families.\r\nChateaubriand describes a Christian priest in France who voluntarily\r\ndevoted himself to slavery for the ransom of a Christian soldier, and\r\nthus restored a husband to his desolate wife, and a father to three\r\nunfortunate children. Such were the deeds which secured to men in those\r\ndays the honor of saintship. Such was the history of St. Zachary, whose\r\nstory drew tears from many eyes, and excited many hearts to imitate so\r\nsublime a charity. In this they did but imitate the spirit of the early\r\nChristians; for the apostolic Clement says, “We know how many among\r\nourselves have given up themselves unto bonds, that thereby they might\r\nfree others from them.” (1st letter to the Corinthians, § 55, or ch.\r\nXXI. V. 20.) One of the most distinguished of the Frankish bishops was\r\nSt. Eloy. He was originally a goldsmith of remarkable skill in his art,\r\nand by his integrity and trustworthiness won the particular esteem and\r\nconfidence of King Clotaire I., and stood high in his court. Of him\r\nNeander speaks as follows. “The cause of the gospel was to him the\r\ndearest interest, to which everything else was made subservient. While\r\nworking at his art, he always had a Bible open before him. The abundant\r\nincome of his labors he devoted to religious objects and deeds of\r\ncharity. Whenever he heard of captives, who in these days _were often\r\ndragged off in troops as slaves that were to be sold at auction_, he\r\nhastened to the spot and paid down their price.” Alas for our\r\nslave-coffles!—there are no such bishops now! “Sometimes, by his means,\r\na hundred at once, men and women, thus obtained their liberty. He then\r\nleft it to their choice, either to return home, or to remain with him as\r\nfree Christian brethren, or to become monks. In the first case, he gave\r\nthem money for their journey; in the last, which pleased him most, he\r\ntook pains to procure them a handsome reception into some monastery.”\r\n\r\nSo great was the zeal of the church for the ransom of unhappy captives,\r\nthat even the ornaments and sacred vessels of the church were sold for\r\ntheir ransom. By the fifth canon of the Council of Macon, held in 585,\r\nit appears that the priests devoted church property to this purpose. The\r\nCouncil of Rheims, held in 625, orders the punishment of suspension on\r\nthe bishop who shall destroy the sacred vessels FOR ANY OTHER MOTIVE\r\nTHAN THE RANSOM OF CAPTIVES; and in the twelfth canon of the Council of\r\nVerneuil, held in 844, we find that the property of the church was still\r\nused for this benevolent purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen the church had thus redeemed the captive, she still continued him\r\nunder her special protection, giving him letters of recommendation which\r\nshould render his liberty safe in the eyes of all men. The Council of\r\nLyons, held in 583, enacts that bishops shall state, in the letters of\r\nrecommendation which they give to redeemed slaves, the date and price of\r\ntheir ransom. The zeal for this work was so ardent that some of the\r\nclergy even went so far as to induce captives to run away. A council\r\ncalled that of St. Patrick, held in Ireland, condemns this practice, and\r\nsays that the clergyman who desires to ransom captives must do so with\r\nhis own money, for to induce them to run away was to expose the clergy\r\nto be considered as robbers, which was a dishonor to the church. The\r\ndisinterestedness of the church in this work appears from the fact that,\r\nwhen she had employed her funds for the ransom of captives she never\r\nexacted from them any recompense, even when they had it in their power\r\nto discharge the debt. In the letters of St. Gregory, he reässures some\r\npersons who had been freed by the church, and who feared that they\r\nshould be called upon to refund the money which had been expended on\r\nthem. The Pope orders that no one, at any time, shall venture to disturb\r\nthem or their heirs, because the sacred canons allow the employment of\r\nthe goods of the church for the ransom of captives. (L. 7, Ep. 14.)\r\nStill further to guard against the increase of the number of slaves, the\r\nCouncil of Lyons, in 566, excommunicated those who unjustly retained\r\nfree persons in slavery.\r\n\r\nIf there were any such laws in the Southern States, and all were\r\nexcommunicated who are doing this, there would be quite a sensation, as\r\nsome recent discoveries show.\r\n\r\nIn 625, the Council of Rheims decreed excommunication to all those who\r\npursue free persons in order to reduce them to slavery. The\r\ntwenty-seventh canon of the Council of London, held 1102, forbade the\r\nbarbarous custom of trading in men, like animals; and the seventh canon\r\nof the Council of Coblentz, held 922, declares that he who takes away a\r\nChristian to sell him is guilty of homicide. A French council, held in\r\nVerneuil in 616, established the law that all persons who had been sold\r\ninto slavery on account of poverty or debt should receive back their\r\nliberty by the restoration of the price which had been paid. It will\r\nreadily be seen that this opened a wide field for restoration to liberty\r\nin an age where so great a Christian zeal had been awakened for the\r\nredeeming of slaves, since it afforded opportunity for Christians to\r\ninterest themselves in raising the necessary ransom.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Jews occupied a very peculiar place among the nations.\r\nThe spirit of trade and commerce was almost entirely confined to them,\r\nand the great proportion of the wealth was in their hands, and, of\r\ncourse, many slaves. The regulations which the church passed relative to\r\nthe slaves of Jews tended still further to strengthen the principles of\r\nliberty. They forbade Jews to compel Christian slaves to do things\r\ncontrary to the religion of Christ. They allowed Christian slaves, who\r\ntook refuge in the church, to be ransomed, by paying their masters the\r\nproper price.\r\n\r\nThis produced abundant results in favor of liberty, inasmuch as they\r\ngave Christian slaves the opportunity of flying to churches, and there\r\nimploring the charity of their brethren. They also enacted that a Jew\r\nwho should pervert a Christian slave should be condemned to lose all his\r\nslaves. This was a new sanction to the slave’s conscience, and a new\r\nopening for liberty. After that, they proceeded to forbid Jews to have\r\nChristian slaves, and it was allowed to ransom those in their possession\r\nfor twelve sous. As the Jews were among the greatest traders of the\r\ntime, the forbidding them to keep slaves was a very decided step toward\r\ngeneral emancipation.\r\n\r\nAnother means of lessening the ranks of slavery was a decree passed in a\r\ncouncil at Rome, in 595, presided over by Pope Gregory the Great. This\r\ndecree offered liberty to all who desired to embrace the monastic life.\r\nThis decree, it is said, led to great scandal, as slaves fled from the\r\nhouses of their masters in great numbers, and took refuge in\r\nmonasteries.\r\n\r\nThe church also ordained that any slave who felt a calling to enter the\r\nministry, and appeared qualified therefor, should be allowed to pursue\r\nhis vocation: and enjoined it upon his master to liberate him, since the\r\nchurch could not permit her minister to wear the yoke of slavery. It is\r\nto be presumed that the phenomenon, on page 176, of a preacher with both\r\ntoes cut off and branded on the breast, advertised as a runaway in the\r\npublic papers, was not one which could have occurred consistently with\r\nthe Christianity of that period.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of all these regulations, it is not surprising that\r\nthere are documents cited by M. Balmes which go to show the following\r\nthings. First, that the number of slaves thus liberated was very great,\r\nas there was universal complaint upon this head.\r\n\r\nSecond, that the bishops were complained of as being _always in favor of\r\nthe slaves_, as carrying their protection to very great lengths,\r\nlaboring in all ways to realize the doctrine of man’s equality; and it\r\nis affirmed in the documents that complaint is made that there is hardly\r\na bishop who cannot be charged with reprehensible compliances in favor\r\nof slaves, and that slaves were aware of this spirit of protection, and\r\nwere ready to throw off their chains, and cast themselves into the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary longer to extend this history. It is as perfectly\r\nplain whither such a course tends, as it is whither the course pursued\r\nby the American clergy at the South tends. We are not surprised that\r\nunder such a course, on the one hand, the number of slaves decreased,\r\ntill there were none in modern Europe. We are not surprised by such a\r\ncourse, on the other hand, that they have increased until there are\r\nthree millions in America.\r\n\r\nAlas for the poor slave! What church befriends him? In what house of\r\nprayer can he take sanctuary? What holy men stand forward to rebuke the\r\nwicked law that denies him legal marriages? What pious bishops visit\r\nslave-coffles to redeem men, women and children, to liberty? What holy\r\nexhortations in churches to buy the freedom of wretched captives? When\r\nhave church velvets been sold, and communion-cups melted down, to\r\nliberate the slave? Where are the pastors, inflamed with the love of\r\nJesus, who have sold themselves into slavery to restore separated\r\nfamilies? Where are those honorable complaints of the world that the\r\nchurch is always on the side of the oppressed?—that the slaves feel the\r\nbeatings of her generous heart, and long to throw themselves into her\r\narms? Love of brethren, holy charities, love of Jesus,—where are ye?—Are\r\nye fled forever?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n    “Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said in the last chapter, it is presumed that it will\r\nappear that the Christian church of America by no means occupies that\r\nposition, with regard to slavery, that the apostles did, or that the\r\nchurch of the earlier ages did.\r\n\r\nHowever they may choose to interpret the language of the apostles, the\r\nfact still remains undeniable, that the church organization which grew\r\nup immediately after these instructions did intend and did effect the\r\nabolition of slavery.\r\n\r\nBut we wish to give still further consideration to one idea which is\r\noften put forward by those who defend American slavery. It is this. That\r\nthe institution is not of itself a sinful one, and that the only sin\r\nconsists in the neglect of its relative duties. All that is necessary,\r\nthey say, is to _regulate_ the institution by the precepts of the\r\ngospel. They admit that no slavery is defensible which is not so\r\nregulated.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, it shall appear that American slave-law _cannot_ be\r\nregulated by the precepts of the gospel, without such alterations as\r\nwill entirely do away the whole system, then it will appear that it is\r\nan unchristian institution, against which every Christian is bound to\r\nremonstrate, and from which he should entirely withdraw.\r\n\r\nThe Roman slave-code was a code made by heathen,—by a race, too,\r\nproverbially stern and unfeeling. It was made in the darkest ages of the\r\nworld, before the light of the gospel had dawned. Christianity gradually\r\nbut certainly abolished it. Some centuries later, a company of men, from\r\nChristian nations, go to the continent of Africa; there they kindle\r\nwars, sow strifes, set tribes against tribes with demoniac violence,\r\nburn villages, and in the midst of these diabolical scenes kidnap and\r\ncarry off, from time to time, hundreds and thousands of miserable\r\ncaptives. Such of those as do not die of terror, grief, suffocation,\r\nship-fever, and other horrors, are, from time to time, landed on the\r\nshores of America. Here they are. And now a set of Christian legislators\r\nmeet together to construct a system and laws of servitude, with regard\r\nto these unfortunates, which is hereafter to be considered as a\r\nChristian institution.\r\n\r\nOf course, in order to have any valid title to such a name, the\r\ninstitution must be regulated by the principles which Christ and his\r\napostles have laid down for the government of those who assume the\r\nrelation of masters. The New Testament sums up these principles in a\r\nsingle sentence: “Masters, give unto your servants that which is just\r\nand equal.”\r\n\r\nBut, forasmuch as there is always some confusion of mind in regard to\r\nwhat is just and equal in our neighbor’s affairs, our Lord has given\r\nthis direction, by which we may arrive at infallible certainty. “All\r\nthings whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, evident that if Christian legislators are about to\r\nform a Christian system of servitude, they must base it on these two\r\nlaws, one of which is a particular specification under the other.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine some of the particulars of the code which they have\r\nformed, and see if it bear this character.\r\n\r\nFirst, they commence by declaring that their brother shall no longer be\r\nconsidered as a person, but deemed, sold, taken, and reputed, as a\r\nchattel personal.—This is “just and equal!”\r\n\r\nThis being the fundamental principle of the system, the following are\r\nspecified as its consequences:\r\n\r\n1. That he shall have no right to hold property of any kind, under any\r\ncircumstances.—Just and equal!\r\n\r\n2. That he shall have no power to contract a legal marriage, or claim\r\nany woman in particular for his wife.—Just and equal!\r\n\r\n3. That he shall have no right to his children, either to protect,\r\nrestrain, guide or educate.—Just and equal!\r\n\r\n4. That the power of his master over him shall be ABSOLUTE, without any\r\npossibility of appeal or redress in consequence of any injury whatever.\r\n\r\nTo secure this, they enact that he shall not be able to enter suit in\r\nany court for any cause.—Just and equal!\r\n\r\nThat he shall not be allowed to bear testimony in any court where any\r\nwhite person is concerned.—Just and equal!\r\n\r\nThat the owner of a servant, for “malicious, cruel, and excessive\r\nbeating of his slave, cannot be indicted.”—Just and equal!\r\n\r\nIt is further decided, that by no indirect mode of suit, through a\r\nguardian, shall a slave obtain redress for ill-treatment. (Dorothea _v._\r\nCoquillon et al, 9 Martin La. Rep. 350.)—Just and equal!\r\n\r\n5. It is decided that the slave shall not only have no legal redress for\r\ninjuries inflicted by his master, but shall have no redress for those\r\ninflicted by any other person, unless the injury impair his property\r\nvalue.—Just and equal!\r\n\r\nUnder this head it is distinctly asserted as follows:\r\n\r\n“There can be no offence against the peace of the state, by the mere\r\nbeating of a slave, unaccompanied by any circumstances of cruelty, or an\r\nintent to kill and murder. The peace of the state is not thereby\r\nbroken.” (State _v._ Maner, 2 Hill’s Rep. S. C.)—Just and equal!\r\n\r\nIf a slave strike a white, he is to be condemned to death; but if a\r\nmaster kill his slave by torture, no white witnesses being present, he\r\nmay clear himself by his own oath. (Louisiana.)—Just and equal!\r\n\r\nThe law decrees fine and imprisonment to the person who shall release\r\nthe servant of another from the torture of the iron collar.\r\n(Louisiana.)—Just and equal!\r\n\r\nIt decrees a much smaller fine, without imprisonment, to the man who\r\nshall torture him with red-hot irons, cut out his tongue, put out his\r\neyes, and scald or maim him. (Ibid.)—Just and equal!\r\n\r\nIt decrees the same punishment to him who teaches him to write as to him\r\nwho puts out his eyes.—Just and equal!\r\n\r\nAs it might be expected that only very ignorant and brutal people could\r\nbe kept in a condition like this, especially in a country where every\r\nbook and every newspaper are full of dissertations on the rights of man,\r\nthey therefore enact laws that neither he nor his children, to all\r\ngenerations, shall learn to read and write.—Just and equal!\r\n\r\nAnd as, if allowed to meet for religious worship, they might concert\r\nsome plan of escape or redress, they enact that “no congregation of\r\nnegroes, under pretence of divine worship, shall assemble themselves;\r\nand that every slave found at such meetings shall be immediately\r\ncorrected, _without trial_, by receiving on the bare back twenty-five\r\nstripes with a whip, switch or cowskin.” (Law of Georgia. Prince’s\r\nDigest, p. 447.)—Just and equal!\r\n\r\nThough the servant is thus kept in ignorance, nevertheless in his\r\nignorance he is punished more severely for the same crimes than\r\nfreemen.—Just and equal!\r\n\r\nBy way of protecting him from over-work, they enact that he shall not\r\nlabor more than five hours longer than convicts at hard labor in a\r\npenitentiary!\r\n\r\nThey also enact that the master or overseer, not the slave, shall decide\r\nwhen he is too sick to work.—Just and equal!\r\n\r\nIf any master, compassionating this condition of the slave, desires to\r\nbetter it, the law takes it out of his power, by the following\r\ndecisions:\r\n\r\n1. That all his earnings shall belong to his master, notwithstanding his\r\nmaster’s promise to the contrary; thus making them liable for his\r\nmaster’s debts.—Just and equal!\r\n\r\n2. That if his master allow him to keep cattle for his own use, it shall\r\nbe lawful for any man to take them away, and enjoy half the profits of\r\nthe seizure.—Just and equal!\r\n\r\n3. If his master sets him free, he shall be taken up and sold\r\nagain.—Just and equal!\r\n\r\n4. If any man or woman runs away from this state of things, and, after\r\nproclamation made, does not return, any two justices of the peace may\r\ndeclare them outlawed, and give permission to any person in the\r\ncommunity to kill them by any ways or means they think fit.—Just and\r\nequal!\r\n\r\nSuch are the laws of that system of slavery which has been made up by\r\nChristian masters late in the Christian era, and is now defended by\r\nChristian ministers as an eminently benign institution.\r\n\r\nIn this manner Christian legislators have expressed their understanding\r\nof the text, “Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and\r\nequal,” and of the text, “All things whatsoever ye would that men should\r\ndo to you, do ye even so to them.”\r\n\r\nIt certainly presents the most extraordinary view of justice and equity,\r\nand is the most remarkable exposition of the principle of doing to\r\nothers as we would others should do to us that it has ever been the good\r\nfortune of the civilized world to observe. This being the _institution_,\r\nlet any one conjecture what its abuses must be; for we are gravely told,\r\nby learned clergymen, that they do not feel called upon to interfere\r\nwith the _system_, but only with its _abuses_. We should like to know\r\nwhat abuse could be specified that is not provided for and expressly\r\nprotected by slave-law.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, Christian republicans, who, with full power to repeal this law,\r\nare daily sustaining it, talk about there being no harm in slavery, if\r\nthey regulate it according to the apostle’s directions, and give unto\r\ntheir servants that which is just and equal. Do they think that, if the\r\nChristianized masters of Rome and Corinth had made such a set of rules\r\nas this for the government of their slaves, Paul would have accepted it\r\nas a proper exposition of what he meant by just and equal?\r\n\r\nBut the Presbyteries of South Carolina say, and all the other religious\r\nbodies at the South say, that the church of our Lord Jesus Christ has no\r\nright to interfere with civil institutions. What is this church of our\r\nLord Jesus Christ, that they speak of? Is it not a collection of\r\nrepublican men, who have constitutional power to alter these laws, and\r\nwhose duty it is to alter them, and who are disobeying the apostle’s\r\ndirections every day till they do alter them? Every minister at the\r\nSouth is a voter as much as he is a minister; every church-member is a\r\nvoter as much as he is a church-member; and ministers and church-members\r\nare among the masters who are keeping up this system of atrocity, when\r\nthey have full republican power to alter it; and yet they talk about\r\ngiving their servants that which is just and equal! If they are going to\r\ngive their servants that which is just and equal, let them give them\r\nback their manhood; they are law-makers, and can do it. Let them give to\r\nthe slave the right to hold property, the right to form legal marriage,\r\nthe right to read the word of God, and to have such education as will\r\nfully develop his intellectual and moral nature; the right of free\r\nreligious opinion and worship; let them give him the right to bring suit\r\nand to bear testimony; give him the right to have some vote in the\r\ngovernment by which his interests are controlled. This will be something\r\nmore like giving him that which _is_ “just and equal.”\r\n\r\nMr. Smylie, of Mississippi, says that the planters of Louisiana and\r\nMississippi, when they are giving from twenty to twenty-five dollars a\r\nbarrel for pork, give their slaves three or four pounds a week; and\r\nintimates that, if that will not convince people that they are doing\r\nwhat is just and equal, he does not know what will.\r\n\r\nMr. C. C. Jones, after stating in various places that he has no\r\nintention ever to interfere with the civil condition of the slave,\r\nteaches the negroes, in his catechism, that the master gives to his\r\nservant that which is just and equal, when he provides for them good\r\nhouses, good clothing, food, nursing, and religious instruction.\r\n\r\nThis is just like a man who has stolen an estate which belongs to a\r\nfamily of orphans. Out of its munificent revenues, he gives the orphans\r\ncomfortable food, clothing, &c., while he retains the rest for his own\r\nuse, declaring that he is thus rendering to them that which is just and\r\nequal.\r\n\r\nIf the laws which regulate slavery were made by a despotic sovereign,\r\nover whose movements the masters could have no control, this mode of\r\nproceeding might be called just and equal; but, as they are made and\r\nkept in operation by these Christian masters, these ministers and\r\nchurch-members, in common with those who are not so, they are every one\r\nof them refusing to the slave that which is just and equal, so long as\r\nthey do not seek the repeal of these laws; and, if they cannot get them\r\nrepealed, it is their duty to take the slave out from under them, since\r\nthey are constructed with such fatal ingenuity as utterly to nullify all\r\nthat the master tries to do for their elevation and permanent benefit.\r\n\r\nNo man would wish to leave his own family of children as slaves under\r\nthe care of the kindest master that ever breathed; and what he would not\r\nwish to have done to his own children, he ought not to do to other\r\npeople’s children.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be said that it is not becoming for the Christian church to\r\nenter into political matters. Again, we ask, what is the Christian\r\nchurch? Is it not an association of republican citizens, each one of\r\nwhom has his rights and duties as a legal voter?\r\n\r\nNow, suppose a law were passed which depreciated the value of cotton or\r\nsugar three cents in the pound, would these men consider the fact that\r\nthey are church-members as any reason why they should not agitate for\r\nthe repeal of such law? Certainly not. Such a law would be brittle as\r\nthe spider’s web; it would be swept away before it was well made. Every\r\nlaw to which the majority of the community does not assent is, in this\r\ncountry, immediately torn down.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, does this monstrous system stand from age to age? Because the\r\ncommunity CONSENT TO IT. They _reënact_ these unjust laws every day, by\r\ntheir silent permission of them.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ is not of this world, say the South\r\nCarolina Presbyteries; therefore, the church has no right to interfere\r\nwith any civil institution; but yet all the clergy of Charleston could\r\nattend in a body to give sanction to the proceedings of the great\r\nVigilance Committee. They could not properly exert the least influence\r\n_against_ slavery, because it is a civil institution, but they could\r\ngive the whole weight of their influence in _favor_ of it.\r\n\r\nIs it not making the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ quite as much of\r\nthis world, to patronize the oppressor, as to patronize the slave?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n    IS THE SYSTEM OF RELIGION WHICH IS TAUGHT THE SLAVE THE GOSPEL?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ladies of England, in their letter to the ladies of America, spoke\r\nin particular of the denial of the gospel to the slave. This has been\r\nindignantly resented in this country, and it has been claimed that the\r\nslaves do have the gospel communicated to them very extensively.\r\n\r\nWhoever reads Mr. Charles C. Jones’ book on the religious instruction of\r\nthe negroes will have no doubt of the following facts:\r\n\r\n1. That from year to year, since the introduction of the negroes into\r\nthis country, various pious and benevolent individuals have made efforts\r\nfor their spiritual welfare.\r\n\r\n2. That these efforts have increased, from year to year.\r\n\r\n3. That the most extensive and important one came into being about the\r\ntime that Mr. Jones’ book was written, in the year 1842, and extended to\r\nsome degree through the United States. The fairest development of it was\r\nprobably in the State of Georgia, the sphere of Mr. Jones’ immediate\r\nlabor, where the most gratifying results were witnessed, and much very\r\namiable and commendable Christian feeling elicited on the part of\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\n4. From time to time, there have been prepared, for the use of the\r\nslave, catechisms, hymns, short sermons, &c. &c., designed to be read to\r\nthem by their masters, or taught them orally.\r\n\r\n5. It will appear to any one who reads Mr. Jones’ book that, though\r\nwritten by a man who believed the system of slavery sanctioned by God,\r\nit manifests a spirit of sincere and earnest benevolence, and of\r\ndevotedness to the cause he has undertaken, which cannot be too highly\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nIt is a very painful and unpleasant task to express any qualification or\r\ndissent with regard to efforts which have been undertaken in a good\r\nspirit, and which have produced, in many respects, good results; but, in\r\nthe reading of Mr. Jones’ book, in the study of his catechism, and of\r\nvarious other catechisms and sermons which give an idea of the religious\r\ninstruction of the slaves, the writer has often been painfully impressed\r\nwith the idea that, however imbued and mingled with good, it is not the\r\n_true and pure gospel system_ which is given to the slave. As far as the\r\nwriter has been able to trace out what is communicated to him, it\r\namounts in substance to this; that his master’s authority over him, and\r\nproperty in him, to the full extent of the enactment of slave-law, is\r\nrecognized and sustained by the tremendous authority of God himself. He\r\nis told that his master is God’s overseer; that he owes him a blind,\r\nunconditional, unlimited submission; that he must not allow himself to\r\ngrumble, or fret, or murmur, at anything in his conduct; and, in case he\r\ndoes so, that his murmuring is not against his master, but against God.\r\nHe is taught that it is God’s will that he should have nothing but labor\r\nand poverty in this world; and that, if he frets and grumbles at this,\r\nhe will get nothing by it in this life, and be sent to hell forever in\r\nthe next. Most vivid descriptions of hell, with its torments, its worms\r\never feeding and never dying, are held up before him; and he is told\r\nthat this eternity of torture will be the result of insubordination\r\nhere. It is no wonder that a slave-holder once said to Dr. Brisbane, of\r\nCincinnati, that religion had been worth more to him, on his plantation,\r\nthan a wagon-load of cowskins.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the slave is taught that to endeavor to evade his master by\r\nrunning away, or to shelter or harbor a slave who has run away, are sins\r\nwhich will expose him to the wrath of that omniscient Being, whose eyes\r\nare in every place.\r\n\r\nAs the slave is a movable and merchantable being, liable, as Mr. Jones\r\ncalmly remarks, to “all the vicissitudes of property,” this system of\r\ninstruction, one would think, would be in something of a dilemma, when\r\nit comes to inculcate the Christian duties of the family state.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Jones takes a survey of the field, previous to commencing his\r\nsystem of operations, he tells us, what we suppose every rational person\r\nmust have foreseen, that he finds among the negroes an utter\r\ndemoralization upon this subject; that polygamy is commonly practised,\r\nand that the marriage-covenant has become a mere temporary union of\r\ninterest, profit or pleasure, formed without reflection, and dissolved\r\nwithout the slightest idea of guilt.\r\n\r\nThat this state of things is the necessary and legitimate result of the\r\nsystem of laws which these Christian men have made and are still keeping\r\nup over their slaves, any sensible person will perceive; and any one\r\nwould think it an indispensable step to any system of religious\r\ninstruction here, that the negro should be placed in a situation where\r\nhe _can_ form a legal marriage, and _can_ adhere to it after it is\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Jones and his coadjutors commenced by declaring that it was not\r\ntheir intention to interfere, in the slightest degree, with the legal\r\nposition of the slave.\r\n\r\nWe should have thought, then, that it would not have been possible, if\r\nthese masters intended to keep their slaves in the condition of chattels\r\npersonal, liable to a constant disruption of family ties, that they\r\ncould have the heart to teach them the strict morality of the gospel\r\nwith regard to the marriage relation.\r\n\r\nBut so it is, however. If we examine Mr. Jones’ catechism, we shall find\r\nthat the slave is made to repeat orally that one man can be the husband\r\nof but one woman, and if, during her lifetime, he marries another, God\r\nwill punish him forever in hell.\r\n\r\nSuppose a conscientious woman, instructed in Mr. Jones’ catechism, by\r\nthe death of her master is thrown into the market for the division of\r\nthe estate, like many cases we may read of in the Georgia papers every\r\nweek. She is torn from her husband and children, and sold at the other\r\nend of the Union, never to meet them again, and the new master commands\r\nher to take another husband;—what, now, is this woman to do? If she take\r\nthe husband, according to her catechism she commits adultery, and\r\nexposes herself to everlasting fire; if she does not take him, she\r\ndisobeys her master, who, she has been taught, is God’s overseer; and\r\nshe is exposed to everlasting fire on that account, and certainly she is\r\nexposed to horrible tortures here.\r\n\r\nNow, we ask, if the teaching that has involved this poor soul in such a\r\nlabyrinth of horrors can be called the gospel?\r\n\r\nIs it the gospel,—is it glad tidings in any sense of the words?\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, this catechism goes on to instruct parents to bring\r\nup their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, that they\r\nshould guide, counsel, restrain and govern them.\r\n\r\nAgain, these teachers tell them that they should search the Scriptures\r\nmost earnestly, diligently and continually, at the same time declaring\r\nthat it is not their intention to interfere with the laws which forbid\r\ntheir being taught to read. Searching the Scriptures, slaves are told,\r\nmeans coming to people who are willing to read to them. Yes, but if\r\nthere be no one willing to do this, what then? Any one whom this\r\ncatechism has thus instructed is sold off to a plantation on Red river,\r\nlike that where Northrop lived; no Bible goes with him; his Christian\r\ninstructors, in their care not to interfere with his civil condition,\r\nhave deprived him of the power of reading; and in this land of darkness\r\nhis oral instruction is but as a faded dream. Let any of us ask for what\r\nsum we would be deprived of all power of ever reading the Bible for\r\nourselves, and made entirely dependent on the reading of\r\nothers,—especially if we were liable to fall into such hands as slaves\r\nare,—and then let us determine whether a system of religious\r\ninstruction, which begins by declaring that it has no intention to\r\ninterfere with this cruel legal deprivation, is the gospel!\r\n\r\nThe poor slave, darkened, blinded, perplexed on every hand, by the\r\ninfluences which the legal system has spread under his feet, is,\r\nfurthermore, strictly instructed in a perfect system of morality. He\r\nmust not even covet anything that is his master’s; he must not murmur or\r\nbe discontented; he must consider his master’s interests as his own, and\r\nbe ready to sacrifice himself to them; and this he must do, as he is\r\ntold, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. He must\r\nforgive all injuries, and do exactly right under all perplexities; thus\r\nis the obligation on his part expounded to him, while his master’s\r\nreciprocal obligations mean only to give him good houses, clothes, food,\r\n&c. &c., leaving every master to determine for himself what is _good_ in\r\nrelation to these matters.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, when such a system of utter injustice is justified to the\r\nnegro by all the awful sanctions of religion, that now and then a strong\r\nsoul rises up against it. We have known under a black skin shrewd minds,\r\nunconquerable spirits, whose indignant sense of justice no such\r\nrepresentations could blind.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Jones has met such is evident; for, speaking of the trials of a\r\nmissionary among them, he says (p. 127):\r\n\r\n  He discovers Deism, Scepticism, Universalism. As already stated, the\r\n  various perversions of the gospel, and all the strong objections\r\n  against the truth of God,—objections which he may, perhaps, have\r\n  considered peculiar only to the cultivated minds, the ripe\r\n  scholarship and profound intelligence, of _critics_ and\r\n  _philosophers_!—extremes here meet on the natural and common ground\r\n  of a darkened understanding and a hardened heart.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the Tenth Annual Report of the “Association for the Religious\r\nInstruction of the Negroes in Liberty County Georgia,” he says:\r\n\r\n  Allow me to relate a fact which occurred in the spring of this year,\r\n  illustrative of the character and knowledge of the negroes at this\r\n  time. I was preaching to a large congregation on the _Epistle to\r\n  Philemon_; and when I insisted upon fidelity and obedience as\r\n  Christian virtues in servants, and, upon the authority of Paul,\r\n  condemned the practice of _running away_, one-half of my audience\r\n  deliberately walked off with themselves, and those that remained\r\n  looked anything but satisfied, either with the preacher or his\r\n  doctrine. After dismission, there was no small stir among them: some\r\n  solemnly declared that there was no such epistle in the Bible;\r\n  others, “that it was not the gospel;” others, “that I preached to\r\n  please masters;” others, “that they did not care if they ever heard\r\n  me preach again.”—pp. 24, 25.\r\n\r\nLundy Lane, an intelligent fugitive who has published his memoirs, says\r\nthat on one occasion they (the slaves) were greatly delighted with a\r\ncertain preacher, until he told them that God had ordained and created\r\nthem expressly to make slaves of. He says that after that they all left\r\nhim, and went away, because they thought, with the Jews, “This is a hard\r\nsaying; who can hear it?”\r\n\r\nIn these remarks on the perversion of the gospel as presented to the\r\nslave, we do not mean to imply that much that is excellent and valuable\r\nis not taught him. We mean simply to assert that, in so far as the\r\nsystem taught justifies the slave-system, so far necessarily it vitiates\r\nthe fundamental ideas of justice and morality; and, so far as the\r\nobligations of the gospel are inculcated on the slave in their purity,\r\nthey bring him necessarily in conflict with the authority of the system.\r\nAs we have said before, it is an attempt to harmonize light with\r\ndarkness, and Christ with Belial. Nor is such an attempt to be justified\r\nand tolerated, because undertaken in the most amiable spirit by amiable\r\nmen. Our admiration of some of the laborers who have conducted this\r\nsystem is very great; so also is our admiration of many of the Jesuit\r\nmissionaries who have spread the Roman Catholic religion among our\r\naboriginal tribes. Devotion and disinterestedness could be carried no\r\nfurther than some of both these classes of men have carried them.\r\n\r\nBut, while our respect for these good men must not seduce us as\r\nProtestants into an admiration of the system which they taught, so our\r\nesteem for our Southern brethren must not lead us to admit that a system\r\nwhich fully justifies the worst kind of spiritual and temporal despotism\r\ncan properly represent the gospel of him who came to preach deliverance\r\nto the captives.\r\n\r\nTo prove that we have not misrepresented the style of instruction, we\r\nwill give some extracts from various sermons and discourses.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, to show how explicitly religious teachers disclaim\r\nany intention of interfering in the legal relation (see Mr. Jones’ work,\r\np. 157):\r\n\r\n  By law or custom, they are excluded from the advantages of\r\n  education; and, by consequence, from the reading of the word of God;\r\n  and this immense mass of immortal beings is thrown, for religious\r\n  instruction, upon _oral_ communications entirely. And upon whom?\r\n  Upon their _owners_. And their owners, especially of late years,\r\n  claim to be the _exclusive guardians_ of their religious\r\n  instruction, and the almoners of divine mercy towards them, thus\r\n  assuming the responsibility of their _entire_ Christianization!\r\n\r\n  All approaches to them from abroad are rigidly guarded against, and\r\n  no ministers are allowed to break to them the bread of life, except\r\n  such as have _commended themselves to the affection and confidence\r\n  of their owners_. I do not condemn this course of self-preservation\r\n  on the part of our citizens; I merely mention it to show their\r\n  _entire dependence_ upon ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn answering objections of masters to allowing the religious instruction\r\nof the negroes, he supposes the following objection, and gives the\r\nfollowing answer:\r\n\r\n  If we suffer our negroes to be instructed, the tendency will be to\r\n  change the civil relations of society as now constituted.\r\n\r\n  To which let it be replied, that we separate entirely their\r\n  _religious_ and their _civil_ condition, and contend that the one\r\n  may be attended to without interfering with the other. Our\r\n  _principle_ is that laid down by the holy and just One: “Render unto\r\n  Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s, and unto God the things which\r\n  are God’s.” And Christ and his apostles are our _example_. Did they\r\n  deem it proper and consistent with the good order of society to\r\n  preach the gospel to the servants? They did. In discharge of this\r\n  duty, did they interfere with their civil condition? They did not.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the description of heaven and the torments of hell, the\r\nfollowing is from Mr. Jones’ catechism, pp. 83, 91, 92:\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Are there two places only spoken of in the Bible to which the\r\n  souls of men go after death?—_A._ Only two.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Which are they?—_A._ Heaven and hell.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ After the Judgment is over, into what place do the righteous\r\n  go?—_A._ Into heaven.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What kind of a place is heaven?—_A._ A most glorious and happy\r\n  place.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Shall the righteous in heaven have any more hunger, or thirst,\r\n  or nakedness, or heat, or cold? Shall they have any more sin, or\r\n  sorrow, or crying, or pain, or death?—_A._ No.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Repeat “And God shall wipe away all tears from their\r\n  eyes.”—_A._ “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and\r\n  there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying; neither\r\n  shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed\r\n  away.”\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Will heaven be their everlasting home?—_A._ Yes.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And shall the righteous grow in knowledge and holiness and\r\n  happiness for ever and ever?—_A._ Yes.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ To what place should we wish and strive to go, more than to all\r\n  other places?—_A._ Heaven.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Into what place are the wicked to be cast?—_A._ Into hell.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Repeat “The wicked shall be turned.”—_A._ “The wicked shall be\r\n  turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.”\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What kind of a place is hell?—_A._ A place of dreadful\r\n  torments.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What does it burn with?—_A._ Everlasting fire.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Who are cast into hell besides wicked men?—_A._ The devil and\r\n  his angels.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What will the torments of hell make the wicked do?—_A._ Weep\r\n  and wail and gnash their teeth.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What did the rich man beg for when he was tormented in the\r\n  flame?—_A._ A drop of cold water to cool his tongue.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Will the wicked have any good thing in hell? the least comfort?\r\n  the least relief from torment?—_A._ No.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Will they ever come out of hell?—_A._ No, never.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Can any go from heaven to hell, or from hell to heaven?—_A._\r\n  No.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What is fixed between heaven and hell?—_A._ A great gulf.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What is the punishment of the wicked in hell called?—_A._\r\n  Everlasting punishment.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Will this punishment make them better?—_A._ No.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Repeat “It is a fearful thing.”—_A._ “It is a fearful thing to\r\n  fall into the hands of the living God.”\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What is God said to be to the wicked?—_A._ A consuming fire.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What place should we strive to escape from above all\r\n  others?—_A._ Hell.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Alex. Glennie, rector of Allsaints parish, Waccamaw, South\r\nCarolina, has for several years been in the habit of preaching with\r\nexpress reference to slaves. In 1844 he published in Charleston a\r\nselection of these sermons, under the title of “Sermons preached on\r\nPlantations to Congregations of Negroes.” This book contains twenty-six\r\nsermons, and in twenty-two of them there is either a more or less\r\nextended account, or a reference to eternal misery in hell as a motive\r\nto duty. He thus describes the day of judgment (Sermon 15, p. 90):\r\n\r\n  When all people shall be gathered before him, “he shall separate\r\n  them, one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the\r\n  goats; and he shall set the sheep on the right hand, but the goats\r\n  on the left.” That, my brethren, will be an awful time, when this\r\n  separation shall be going on; when the holy angels, at the command\r\n  of the great Judge, shall be gathering together all the obedient\r\n  followers of Christ, and be setting them on the right hand of the\r\n  Judgment-seat, and shall place all the remainder on the left.\r\n  Remember that each of you must be present; remember that the Great\r\n  Judge can make no mistake; and that you shall be placed on one side\r\n  or on the other, according as in this world you have believed in and\r\n  obeyed him or not. How full of joy and thanksgiving will you be, if\r\n  you shall find yourself placed on the right hand! but how full of\r\n  misery and despair, if the left shall be appointed as your portion!\r\n  * * * *\r\n\r\n  But what shall he say to the wicked on the left hand? To them he\r\n  shall say, “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,\r\n  prepared for the devil and his angels.” He will tell them to depart;\r\n  they did not, while here, seek him by repentance and faith; they did\r\n  not obey him, and now he will drive them from him. He will call them\r\n  cursed.\r\n\r\n  (Sermon 1, p. 42.) The death which is the wages of sin is this\r\n  everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. It is a fire\r\n  which shall last forever; and the devil and his angels, and all\r\n  people who will not love and serve God, shall there be punished\r\n  forever. The Bible says, “The smoke of their torment ascendeth up\r\n  for ever and ever.” The fire is not quenched, it never goes out,\r\n  “their worm dieth not;” their punishment is spoken of as a worm\r\n  always feeding upon but never consuming them; it never can stop.\r\n\r\nConcerning the absolute authority of the master, take the following\r\nextract from Bishop Mead’s sermon. (Brooke’s Slavery, pp. 30, 31, 32.)\r\n\r\n  Having thus shown you the chief duties you owe to your great Master\r\n  in heaven, I now come to lay before you the duties you owe to your\r\n  masters and mistresses here upon earth; and for this you have one\r\n  general rule that you ought always to carry in your minds, and that\r\n  is, to do all service for them as if you did it for God himself.\r\n  Poor creatures! you little consider, when you are idle and\r\n  neglectful of your masters’ business, when you steal and waste and\r\n  hurt any of their substance, when you are saucy and impudent, when\r\n  you are telling them lies and deceiving them; or when you prove\r\n  stubborn and sullen, and will not do the work you are set about\r\n  without stripes and vexation; you do not consider, I say, that _what\r\n  faults you are guilty of towards your masters and mistresses are\r\n  faults done against God himself_, who hath set your masters and\r\n  mistresses over you in his own stead, and expects that you will do\r\n  for them just as you would do for Him. And, pray, do not think that\r\n  I want to deceive you when I tell you that _your masters and\r\n  mistresses are God’s overseers_; and that, if you are faulty towards\r\n  them, God himself will punish you severely for it in the next world,\r\n  unless you repent of it, and strive to make amends by your\r\n  faithfulness and diligence for the time to come; for God himself\r\n  hath declared the same.\r\n\r\n  Now, from this general rule,—namely, that you are to do all service\r\n  for your masters and mistresses as if you did it for God\r\n  himself,—there arise several other rules of duty towards your\r\n  masters and mistresses, which I shall endeavor to lay out in order\r\n  before you.\r\n\r\n  And, in the first place, you are to be obedient and subject to your\r\n  masters in all things.... And Christian ministers are commanded to\r\n  “exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to\r\n  please them well in all things, not answering them again, or\r\n  gainsaying.” You see how strictly God requires this of you, that\r\n  whatever your masters and mistresses order you to do, you must set\r\n  about it immediately, and faithfully perform it, without any\r\n  disputing or grumbling, and take care to please them well in all\r\n  things. And for your encouragement he tells you that he will reward\r\n  you for it in heaven; because, while you are honestly and faithfully\r\n  doing your master’s business here, you are serving your Lord and\r\n  Master in heaven. You see also that you are not to take any\r\n  exceptions to the behavior of your masters and mistresses; and that\r\n  you are to be subject and obedient, not only to such as are good,\r\n  and gentle, and mild, towards you, but also to such as may be\r\n  froward, peevish, and hard. For you are not at liberty to choose\r\n  your own masters; but into whatever hands God hath been pleased to\r\n  put you, you must do your duty, and God will reward you for it.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _You are to be faithful and honest to your masters and mistresses,\r\n  not purloining or wasting their goods or substance, but showing all\r\n  good fidelity in all things...._ Do not your masters, under God,\r\n  provide for you? And how shall they be able to do this, to feed and\r\n  to clothe you, unless you take honest care of everything that\r\n  belongs to them? _Remember that God requires this of you; and, if\r\n  you are not afraid of suffering for it here, you cannot escape the\r\n  vengeance of Almighty God, who will judge between you and your\r\n  masters, and make you pay severely in the next world for all the\r\n  injustice you do them here._ And though you could manage so\r\n  cunningly as to escape the eyes and hands of man, yet think what a\r\n  dreadful thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God, who\r\n  is able to cast both soul and body into hell!\r\n\r\n  _You are to serve your masters with cheerfulness, reverence, and\r\n  humility. You are to do your masters’ service with good will, doing\r\n  it as the will of God from the heart, without any sauciness or\r\n  answering again._ How many of you do things quite otherwise, and,\r\n  instead of going about your work with a good will and a good heart,\r\n  dispute and grumble, give saucy answers, and behave in a surly\r\n  manner! There is something so becoming and engaging in a modest,\r\n  cheerful, good-natured behavior, that a little work done in that\r\n  manner seems better done, and gives far more satisfaction, than a\r\n  great deal more, that must be done with fretting, vexation, and the\r\n  lash always held over you. It also gains the good will and love of\r\n  those you belong to, and makes your own life pass with more ease and\r\n  pleasure. Besides, you are to consider that this grumbling and\r\n  ill-will do not affect your masters and mistresses only. They have\r\n  ways and means in their hands of forcing you to do your work,\r\n  whether you are willing or not. _But your murmuring and grumbling is\r\n  against God, who hath placed you in that service, who will punish\r\n  you severely in the next world for despising his commands._\r\n\r\nA very awful query here occurs to the mind. If the poor, ignorant slave,\r\nwho wastes his master’s temporal goods to answer some of his own present\r\npurposes, be exposed to this heavy retribution, what will become of\r\nthose educated men, who, for their temporal convenience, make and hold\r\nin force laws which rob generation after generation of men, not only of\r\ntheir daily earnings, but of all their rights and privileges as immortal\r\nbeings?\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Glennie, in one of his sermons, as quoted by Mr. Bowditch,\r\np. 137, assures his hearers that none of them will be able to say, in\r\nthe day of judgment, “I had no way of hearing about my God and Saviour.”\r\n\r\nBishop Meade, as quoted by Brooke, pp. 34, 35, thus expatiates to slaves\r\non the advantages of their condition. One would really think, from\r\nreading this account, that every one ought to make haste and get himself\r\nsold into slavery, as the nearest road to heaven.\r\n\r\n  _Take care that you do not fret or murmur, grumble or repine at your\r\n  condition; for this will not only make your life uneasy, but will\r\n  greatly offend Almighty God._ Consider that it is not yourselves, it\r\n  is not the people that you belong to, it is not the men that have\r\n  brought you to it, but _it is the will of God, who hath by his\r\n  providence made you servants, because, no doubt, he knew that\r\n  condition would be best for you in this world, and help you the\r\n  better towards heaven, if you would but do your duty in it_. So that\r\n  any discontent at your not being free, or rich, or great, as you see\r\n  some others, is quarrelling with your heavenly Master, and finding\r\n  fault with God himself, who hath made you what you are, and hath\r\n  promised you as large a share in the kingdom of heaven as the\r\n  greatest man alive, if you will but behave yourself aright, and do\r\n  the business he hath set you about in this world honestly and\r\n  cheerfully. Riches and power have proved the ruin of many an unhappy\r\n  soul, by drawing away the heart and affections from God, and fixing\r\n  them on mean and sinful enjoyments; so that, when God, who knows our\r\n  hearts better than we know them ourselves, sees that they would be\r\n  hurtful to us, and therefore keeps them from us, it is the greatest\r\n  mercy and kindness he could show us.\r\n\r\n  You may perhaps fancy that, if you had riches and freedom, you could\r\n  do your duty to God and man with greater pleasure than you can now.\r\n  But, pray, consider that, if you can but save your souls, through\r\n  the mercy of God, you will have spent your time to the best of\r\n  purposes in this world; and he that at last can get to heaven has\r\n  performed a noble journey, let the road be ever so rugged and\r\n  difficult. Besides, you really have a great advantage over most\r\n  white people, who have not only the care of their daily labor upon\r\n  their hands, but the care of looking forward and providing\r\n  necessaries for to-morrow and next day, and of clothing and bringing\r\n  up their children, and of getting food and raiment for as many of\r\n  you as belong to their families, which often puts them to great\r\n  difficulties, and distracts their minds so as to break their rest,\r\n  and take off their thoughts from the affairs of another world.\r\n  Whereas, you are quite eased from all these cares, and have nothing\r\n  but your daily labor to look after and, when that is done, take your\r\n  needful rest. Neither is it necessary for you to think of laying up\r\n  anything against old age, as white people are obliged to do; for the\r\n  laws of the country have provided that you shall not be turned off\r\n  when you are past labor, but shall be maintained, while you live, by\r\n  those you belong to, whether you are able to work or not.\r\n\r\nBishop Meade further consoles slaves thus for certain incidents of their\r\nlot, for which they may think they have more reason to find fault than\r\nfor most others. The reader must admit that he takes a very\r\nphilosophical view of the subject.\r\n\r\n  There is only one circumstance which may appear grievous, that I\r\n  shall now take notice of, and that is correction.\r\n\r\n  Now, when correction is given you, you either deserve it, or you do\r\n  not deserve it. But, whether you really deserve it or not, it is\r\n  your duty, and Almighty God requires, that you bear it patiently You\r\n  may perhaps think that this is hard doctrine; but if you consider it\r\n  right, you must needs think otherwise of it. Suppose, then, that you\r\n  deserve correction; you cannot but say that it is just and right you\r\n  should meet with it. Suppose you do not, or at least you do not\r\n  deserve so much, or so severe a correction, for the fault you have\r\n  committed; you perhaps have escaped a great many more, and at last\r\n  paid for all. Or, suppose you are quite innocent of what is laid to\r\n  your charge, and suffer wrongfully in that particular thing; is it\r\n  not possible you may have done some other bad thing which was never\r\n  discovered, and that Almighty God, who saw you doing it, would not\r\n  let you escape without punishment, one time or another? And ought\r\n  you not, in such a case, to give glory to him, and be thankful that\r\n  he would rather punish you in this life for your wickedness, than\r\n  destroy your souls for it in the next life? But, suppose even this\r\n  was not the case (a case hardly to be imagined), and that you have\r\n  by no means, known or unknown, deserved the correction you suffered;\r\n  there is this great comfort in it, that, if you bear it patiently,\r\n  and leave your cause in the hands of God, he will reward you for it\r\n  in heaven, and the punishment you suffer unjustly here shall turn to\r\n  your exceeding great glory hereafter.\r\n\r\nThat Bishop Meade has no high opinion of the present comforts of a life\r\nof slavery, may be fairly inferred from the following remarks which he\r\nmakes to slaves:\r\n\r\n  Your own poor circumstances in this life ought to put you\r\n  particularly upon this, and taking care of your souls; for you\r\n  cannot have the pleasures and enjoyments of this life like rich free\r\n  people, who have estates and money to lay out as they think fit. If\r\n  others will run the hazard of their souls, they have a chance of\r\n  getting wealth and power, of heaping up riches, and enjoying all the\r\n  ease, luxury and pleasure their hearts should long after. But you\r\n  can have none of these things; so that, if you sell your souls, for\r\n  the sake of what poor matters you can get in this world, you have\r\n  made a very foolish bargain indeed.\r\n\r\nThis information is certainly very explicit and to the point. He\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n  Almighty God hath been pleased to make you slaves here, and to give\r\n  you nothing but labor and poverty in this world, which you are\r\n  obliged to submit to, as it is his will that it should be so. And\r\n  think within yourselves, what a terrible thing it would be, after\r\n  all your labors and sufferings in this life, to be turned into hell\r\n  in the next life, and, after wearing out your bodies in service\r\n  here, to go into a far worse slavery when this is over, and your\r\n  poor souls be delivered over into the possession of the devil, to\r\n  become his slaves forever in hell, without any hope of ever getting\r\n  free from it! If, therefore, you would be God’s freemen in heaven,\r\n  you must strive to be good, and serve him here on earth. Your\r\n  bodies, you know, are not your own; they are at the disposal of\r\n  those you belong to; but your precious souls are still your own,\r\n  which nothing can take from you, if it be not your own fault.\r\n  Consider well, then, that if you lose your souls by leading idle,\r\n  wicked lives here, you have got nothing by it in this world, and you\r\n  have lost your all in the next. For your idleness and wickedness is\r\n  generally found out, and your bodies suffer for it here; and, what\r\n  is far worse, if you do not repent and amend, your unhappy souls\r\n  will suffer for it hereafter.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones, in that part of the work where he is obviating the objections\r\nof masters to the Christian instruction of their slaves, supposes the\r\nmaster to object thus:\r\n\r\n  You teach them that “God is no respecter of persons;” that “He hath\r\n  made of one blood, all nations of men;” “Thou shalt love thy\r\n  neighbor as thyself;” “All things whatsoever ye would that men\r\n  should do to you, do ye even so to them;” what use, let me ask,\r\n  would they make of these sentences from the gospel?\r\n\r\nMr. Jones says:\r\n\r\n  Let it be replied, that the effect urged in the objection might\r\n  result from _imperfect_ and _injudicious_ religious instruction;\r\n  indeed, religious instruction may be communicated _with the express\r\n  design_, on the part of the instructor, to produce the effect\r\n  referred to, instances of which have occurred.\r\n\r\n  But who will say that neglect of duty and insubordination are the\r\n  _legitimate_ effects of the gospel, purely and sincerely imparted to\r\n  servants? Has it not in all ages been viewed as the greatest\r\n  civilizer of the human race?\r\n\r\nHow Mr. Jones would interpret the golden rule to the slave, so as to\r\njustify the slave-system, we cannot possibly tell. We can, however, give\r\na specimen of the manner in which it has been interpreted in Bishop\r\nMeade’s sermons, p. 116. (Brooke’s Slavery, &c., pp. 32, 33.)\r\n\r\n  “All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye\r\n  even so unto them;” that is, do by all mankind just as you would\r\n  desire they should do by you, if you were in their place, and they\r\n  in yours.\r\n\r\n  Now, to suit this rule to your particular circumstances, suppose you\r\n  were masters and mistresses, and had servants under you: would you\r\n  not desire that your servants should do their business faithfully\r\n  and honestly, as well when your back was turned as while you were\r\n  looking over them? Would you not expect that they should take notice\r\n  of what you said to them? that they should behave themselves with\r\n  respect towards you and yours, and be as careful of everything\r\n  belonging to you as you would be yourselves? You are servants: do,\r\n  therefore, as you would wish to be done by, and you will be both\r\n  good servants to your masters, and good servants to God, who\r\n  requires this of you, and will reward you well for it, if you do it\r\n  for the sake of conscience, in obedience to his commands.\r\n\r\nThe reverend teachers of such expositions of scripture do great\r\ninjustice to the natural sense of their sable catechumens, if they\r\nsuppose them incapable of detecting such very shallow sophistry, and of\r\nproving conclusively that “it is a poor rule that wont work both ways.”\r\nSome shrewd old patriarch, of the stamp of those who rose up and went\r\nout at the exposition of the Epistle to Philemon, and who show such\r\ngreat acuteness in bringing up objections against the truth of God, such\r\nas would be thought peculiar to cultivated minds, might perhaps, if he\r\ndared, reply to such an exposition of scripture in this way: “Suppose\r\nyou were a slave,—could not have a cent of your own earnings during your\r\nwhole life, could have no legal right to your wife and children, could\r\nnever send your children to school, and had, as you have told us,\r\nnothing but labor and poverty in this life,-how would you like it? Would\r\nyou not wish your Christian master to set you free from this condition?”\r\nWe submit it to every one who is no respecter of persons, whether this\r\ninterpretation of Sambos is not as good as the bishops. And if not, why\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nTo us, with our feelings and associations, such discourses as these of\r\nBishop Meade appear hard-hearted and unfeeling to the last degree. We\r\nshould, however, do great injustice to the character of the man, if we\r\nsupposed that they prove him to have been such. They merely go to show\r\nhow perfectly use may familiarize amiable and estimable men with a\r\nsystem of oppression, till they shall have lost all consciousness of the\r\nwrong which it involves.\r\n\r\nThat Bishop Meades, reasonings did not thoroughly convince himself is\r\nevident from the fact that, after all his representations of the\r\nsuperior advantages of slavery as a means of religious improvement, he\r\ndid, at last, emancipate his own slaves.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to what has been said, this whole system of religious\r\ninstruction is darkened by one hideous shadow,—THE SLAVE-TRADE. What\r\ndoes the Southern church do with her catechumens and communicants? Read\r\nthe advertisements of Southern newspapers, and see. In every city in the\r\nslave-raising states behold the dépôts, kept constantly full of assorted\r\nnegroes from the ages of ten to thirty! In every slave-consuming state\r\nsee the receiving-houses, whither these poor wrecks and remnants of\r\nfamilies are constantly borne! Who preaches the gospel to the\r\nslave-coffles? Who preaches the gospel in the slave-prisons? If we\r\nconsider the tremendous extent of this internal trade,—if we read papers\r\nwith columns of auction advertisements of human beings, changing hands\r\nas freely as if they were dollar-bills instead of human creatures,—we\r\nshall then realize how utterly all those influences of religious\r\ninstruction must be nullified by leaving the subjects of them exposed\r\n“to all the vicissitudes of property.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n                          WHAT IS TO BE DONE?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thing to be done, of which I shall chiefly speak, is that the whole\r\nAmerican church, of all denominations, should unitedly come up, not _in\r\nform_, but _in fact_, to the noble purpose avowed by the Presbyterian\r\nAssembly of 1818, to seek the ENTIRE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY THROUGHOUT\r\nAMERICA AND THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM.\r\n\r\nTo this noble course the united voice of Christians in all other\r\ncountries is urgently calling the American church. Expressions of this\r\nfeeling have come from Christians of all denominations in England, in\r\nScotland, in Ireland, in France, in Switzerland, in Germany, in Persia,\r\nin the Sandwich Islands, and in China. All seem to be animated by one\r\nspirit. They have loved and honored this American church. They have\r\nrejoiced in the brightness of her rising. Her prosperity and success\r\nhave been to them as their own, and they have had hopes that God meant\r\nto confer inestimable blessings through her upon all nations. The\r\nAmerican church has been to them like the rising of a glorious sun,\r\nshedding healing from his wings, dispersing mists and fogs, and bringing\r\nsongs of birds and voices of cheerful industry, and sounds of gladness,\r\ncontentment and peace. But, lo! in this beautiful orb is seen a\r\ndisastrous spot of dim eclipse, whose gradually widening shadow\r\nthreatens a total darkness. Can we wonder that the voice of remonstrance\r\ncomes to us from those who have so much at stake in our prosperity and\r\nsuccess? We have sent out our missionaries to all quarters of the globe;\r\nbut how shall they tell their heathen converts the things that are done\r\nin Christianized America? How shall our missionaries in Mahometan\r\ncountries hold up their heads, and proclaim the superiority of our\r\nreligion, when we tolerate barbarities which they have repudiated!\r\n\r\nA missionary among the Karens, in Asia, writes back that his course is\r\nmuch embarrassed by a suspicion that is afloat among the Karens that the\r\nAmericans intend to steal and sell them. He says:\r\n\r\n  I dread the time when these Karens will be able to read our books,\r\n  and get a full knowledge of all that is going on in our country.\r\n  Many of them are very inquisitive now, and often ask me questions\r\n  that I find it very difficult to answer.\r\n\r\nNo, there is no resource. The church of the United States is shut up, in\r\nthe providence of God, to one work. She can never fulfil her mission\r\ntill this is done. So long as she neglects this, it will lie in the way\r\nof everything else which she attempts to do\r\n\r\nShe must undertake it for another reason,—because she alone can perform\r\nthe work peaceably. If this fearful problem is left to take its course\r\nas a mere political question, to be ground out between the upper and\r\nnether millstones of political parties, then what will avert agitation,\r\nangry collisions, and the desperate rending the Union? No, there is no\r\nsafety but in making it a religious enterprise, and pursuing it in a\r\nChristian spirit, and by religious means.\r\n\r\nIf it now be asked what means shall the church employ, we answer, this\r\nevil must be abolished by the same means which the apostles first used\r\nfor the spread of Christianity, and the extermination of all the social\r\nevils which then filled a world lying in wickedness. Hear the apostle\r\nenumerate them: “BY PURENESS, BY KNOWLEDGE, BY LONG-SUFFERING, BY THE\r\nHOLY GHOST, BY LOVE UNFEIGNED, BY THE ARMOR OF RIGHTEOUSNESS ON THE\r\nRIGHT HAND AND ON THE LEFT.”\r\n\r\nWe will briefly consider each of these means.\r\n\r\nFirst, “by Pureness.” Christians in the Northern free states must\r\nendeavor to purify themselves and the country from various malignant\r\nresults of the system of slavery; and, in particular, they must endeavor\r\nto abolish that which is the most sinful,—the unchristian prejudice of\r\ncaste.\r\n\r\nIn Hindostan there is a class called the Pariahs, with which no other\r\nclass will associate, eat or drink. Our missionaries tell the converted\r\nHindoo that this prejudice is unchristian; for God hath made of one\r\nblood all who dwell on the face of the earth, and all mankind are\r\nbrethren in Christ. With what face shall they tell this to the Hindoo,\r\nif he is able to reply, “In your own Christian country there is a class\r\nof Pariahs who are treated no better than we treat ours. You do not\r\nyourselves believe the things you teach us.”\r\n\r\nLet us look at the treatment of the free negro at the North. In the\r\nStates of Indiana and Illinois the most oppressive and unrighteous laws\r\nhave been passed with regard to him. No law of any slave state could be\r\nmore cruel in its spirit than that recently passed in Illinois, by which\r\nevery free negro coming into the state is taken up and sold for a\r\ncertain time, and then, if he do not leave the state, is sold again.\r\n\r\nWith what face can we exhort our Southern brethren to emancipate their\r\nslaves, if we do not set the whole moral power of the church at the\r\nNorth against such abuses as this? Is this course justified by saying\r\nthat the negro is vicious and idle? This is adding insult to injury.\r\n\r\nWhat is it these Christian states do? To a great extent they exclude the\r\ncolored population from their schools; they discourage them from\r\nattending their churches by invidious distinctions; as a general fact,\r\nthey exclude them from their shops, where they might learn useful arts\r\nand trades; they crowd them out of the better callings where they might\r\nearn an honorable livelihood; and, having thus discouraged every\r\nelevated aspiration, and reduced them to almost inevitable ignorance,\r\nidleness and vice, they fill up the measure of iniquity by making cruel\r\nlaws to expel them from their states, thus heaping up wrath against the\r\nday of wrath.\r\n\r\nIf we say that every Christian at the South who does not use his utmost\r\ninfluence against their iniquitous slave-laws is guilty, as a republican\r\ncitizen, of sustaining those laws, it is no less true that every\r\nChristian at the North who does not do what in him lies to procure the\r\nrepeal of such laws in the free states is, so far, guilty for their\r\nexistence. Of late years we have had abundant quotations from the Old\r\nTestament to justify all manner of oppression. A Hindoo, who knew\r\nnothing of this generous and beautiful book, except from such pamphlets\r\nas Mr. Smylie’s, might possibly think it was a treatise on piracy, and a\r\ngeneral justification of robbery. But let us quote from it the\r\ndirections which God gives for the treatment of the stranger: “If a\r\nstranger sojourn with you in your land, ye shall not vex him. But the\r\nstranger that dwelleth among you shall be as one born among you: thou\r\nshall love him as thyself.” How much more does this apply when the\r\nstranger has been brought into our land by the injustice and cruelty of\r\nour fathers!\r\n\r\nWe are happy to say, however, that the number of states in which such\r\noppressive legislation exists is small. It is also matter of\r\nencouragement and hope that the unphilosophical and unchristian\r\nprejudice of caste is materially giving way, in many parts of our\r\ncountry, before a kinder and more Christian spirit.\r\n\r\nMany of our schools and colleges are willing to receive the colored\r\napplicant on equal terms with the white. Some of the Northern free\r\nstates accord to the colored free man full political equality and\r\nprivileges. Some of the colored people, under this encouragement, have,\r\nin many parts of our country, become rich and intelligent. A very fair\r\nproportion of educated men is rising among them. There are among them\r\nrespectable editors, eloquent orators, and laborious and well-instructed\r\nclergymen. It gives us pleasure to say that among intelligent and\r\nChristian people these men are treated with the consideration they\r\ndeserve; and, if they meet with insult and ill-treatment, it is commonly\r\nfrom the less-educated class, who, being less enlightened, are always\r\nlonger under the influence of prejudice. At a recent ordination at one\r\nof the largest and most respectable churches in New York, the moderator\r\nof the presbytery was a black man, who began life as a slave; and it was\r\nundoubtedly a source of gratification to all his Christian brethren to\r\nsee him presiding in this capacity. He put the questions to the\r\ncandidate in the German language, the church being in part composed of\r\nGermans. Our Christian friends in Europe may, at least, infer from this\r\nthat, if we have had our faults in times past, we have, some of us, seen\r\nand are endeavoring to correct them.\r\n\r\nTo bring this head at once to a practical conclusion, the writer will\r\nsay to every individual Christian, who wishes to do something for the\r\nabolition of slavery, begin by doing what lies in your power for the\r\ncolored people in your vicinity. Are there children excluded from\r\nschools by unchristian prejudice? Seek to combat that prejudice by fair\r\narguments, presented in a right spirit. If you cannot succeed, then\r\nendeavor to provide for the education of these children in some other\r\nmanner. As far as in you lies, endeavor to secure for them, in every\r\nwalk of life, the ordinary privileges of American citizens. If they are\r\nexcluded from the omnibus and railroad-car in the place where you\r\nreside, endeavor to persuade those who have the control of these matters\r\nto pursue a more just and reasonable course. Those Christians who are\r\nheads of mechanical establishments can do much for the cause by\r\nreceiving colored apprentices. Many masters excuse themselves for\r\nexcluding the colored apprentice by saying that if they receive him all\r\ntheir other hands will desert them. To this it is replied, that if they\r\ndo the thing in a Christian temper and for a Christian purpose, the\r\nprobability is that, if their hands desert at first, they will return to\r\nthem at last—all of them, at least, whom they would care to retain.\r\n\r\nA respectable dressmaker in one of our towns has, as a matter of\r\nprinciple, taken colored girls for apprentices, thus furnishing them\r\nwith a respectable means of livelihood. Christian mechanics, in all the\r\nwalks of life, are earnestly requested to consider this subject, and see\r\nif, by offering their hand to raise this poor people to respectability\r\nand knowledge and competence, they may not be performing a service which\r\nthe Lord will accept as done unto himself.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which is earnestly commended to Christians is the raising\r\nand comforting of those poor churches of colored people, who have been\r\ndiscouraged, dismembered and disheartened, by the operation of the\r\nfugitive slave law.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Boston is a church, which, even now, is struggling with\r\ndebt and embarrassment, caused by being obliged to buy its own deacons,\r\nto shield them from the terrors of that law.\r\n\r\nLastly, Christians at the North, we need not say, should abstain from\r\nall _trading in slaves_, whether direct or indirect, whether by\r\npartnership with Southern houses or by receiving immortal beings as\r\nsecurity for debt. It is not necessary to expand this point. It speaks\r\nfor itself.\r\n\r\nBy all these means the Christian church at the North must secure for\r\nitself purity from all complicity with the sin of slavery, and from the\r\nunchristian customs and prejudices which have resulted from it.\r\n\r\nThe second means to be used for the abolition of slavery is “Knowledge.”\r\n\r\nEvery Christian ought thoroughly, carefully and prayerfully, to examine\r\nthis system of slavery. He should regard it as one upon which he is\r\nbound to have right views and right opinions, and to exert a right\r\ninfluence in forming and concentrating a powerful public sentiment, of\r\nall others the most efficacious remedy. Many people are deterred from\r\nexamining the statistics on this subject, because they do not like the\r\nmen who have collected them. They say they do not like abolitionists,\r\nand therefore they will not attend to those facts and figures which they\r\nhave accumulated. This, certainly, is not wise or reasonable. In all\r\nother subjects which deeply affect our interests, we think it best to\r\ntake information where we can get it, whether we like the persons who\r\ngive it to us or not.\r\n\r\nEvery Christian ought seriously to examine the extent to which our\r\nnational government is pledged and used for the support of slavery. He\r\nshould thoroughly look into the statistics of slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia, and, above all, into the statistics of that awful system of\r\nlegalized piracy and oppression by which hundreds and thousands are\r\nyearly torn from home and friends, and all that heart holds dear, and\r\ncarried to be sold like beasts in the markets of the South. The smoke\r\nfrom this bottomless abyss of injustice puts out the light of our\r\nSabbath suns in the eyes of all nations. Its awful groans and wailings\r\ndrown the voice of our psalms and religious melodies. All nations know\r\nthese things of us, and shall we not know them of ourselves? Shall we\r\nnot have courage, shall we not have patience, to investigate thoroughly\r\nour own bad case, and gain a perfect knowledge of the length and breadth\r\nof the evil we seek to remedy?\r\n\r\nThe third means for the abolition of slavery is “Long-suffering.”\r\n\r\nOf this quality there has been some lack in the attempts that have\r\nhitherto been made. The friends of the cause have not had patience with\r\neach other, and have not been able to treat each other’s opinions with\r\nforbearance. There have been many painful things in the past history of\r\nthis subject; but is it not time when all the friends of the slave\r\nshould adopt the motto, “_forgetting_ the things that are behind, and\r\nreaching forth unto those which are before”? Let not the believers of\r\nimmediate abolition call those who believe in gradual emancipation\r\ntime-servers and traitors; and let not the upholders of gradual\r\nemancipation call the advocates of immediate abolition fanatics and\r\nincendiaries. Surely some more brotherly way of convincing good men can\r\nbe found, than by standing afar off on some Ebal and Gerizim, and\r\ncursing each other. The truth spoken in love will always go further then\r\nthe truth spoken in wrath: and, after all, the great object is to\r\npersuade our Southern brethren to admit the idea of _any_ emancipation\r\nat all. When we have succeeded in persuading them that _anything_ is\r\nnecessary to be done, then will be the time for bringing up the question\r\nwhether the object shall be accomplished by an immediate or a gradual\r\nprocess. Meanwhile, let our motto be, “Whereto we have already attained,\r\nlet us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same things; and if any\r\nman be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto him.” “Let us\r\nreceive even him that is weak in the faith, but not to doubtful\r\ndisputations.” Let us not reject the good there is in any, because of\r\nsome remaining defects.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the consideration of a power without which all others\r\nmust fail,—“the Holy Ghost.”\r\n\r\nThe solemn creed of every Christian church, whether Roman, Greek,\r\nEpiscopal or Protestant, says, “_I believe in the Holy Ghost_.” But how\r\noften do Christians, in all these denominations, live and act, and even\r\nconduct their religious affairs, as if they had “never so much as heard\r\nwhether there be any Holy Ghost.” If we trust to our own reasonings, our\r\nown misguided passions, and our own blind self-will, to effect the\r\nreform of abuses, we shall utterly fail. There is a power, silent,\r\nconvincing, irresistible, which moves over the dark and troubled heart\r\nof man, as of old it moved over the dark and troubled waters of Chaos,\r\nbringing light out of darkness, and order out of confusion.\r\n\r\nIs it not evident to every one who takes enlarged views of human society\r\nthat a gentle but irresistible influence is pervading the human race,\r\nprompting groanings and longings and dim aspirations for some coming era\r\nof good? Worldly men read the signs of the times, and call this power\r\nthe _Spirit of the Age_,—but should not the church acknowledge it as the\r\nspirit of God?\r\n\r\nLet it not be forgotten, however, that the gift of his most powerful\r\nregenerating influence, at the opening of the Christian dispensation,\r\nwas conditioned on prayer The mighty movement that began on the day of\r\nPentecost was preceded by united, fervent persevering prayer. A similar\r\nspirit of prayer must precede the coming of the divine Spirit, to effect\r\na revolution so great as that at which we aim. The most powerful\r\ninstrumentality which God has delegated to man, and around which cluster\r\nall his glorious promises, is prayer. All past prejudices and\r\nanimosities on this subject must be laid aside, and the whole church\r\nunite as one man in earnest, fervent prayer. Have we forgotten the\r\npromise of the Holy Ghost? Have we forgotten that He was to abide with\r\nus forever? Have we forgotten that it is He who is to convince the world\r\nof sin, of righteousness and of judgment? O, divine and Holy Comforter!\r\nThou promise of the Father! Thou only powerful to enlighten, convince\r\nand renew! Return, we beseech thee, and visit this vine and this\r\nvineyard of thy planting! With thee nothing is impossible; and what we,\r\nin our weakness, can scarcely conceive, thou canst accomplish!\r\n\r\nAnother means for the abolition of slavery is “Love unfeigned.”\r\n\r\nIn all moral conflicts, that party who can preserve, through every\r\ndegree of opposition and persecution, a divine, un-provokable spirit of\r\nlove, must finally conquer. Such are the immutable laws of the moral\r\nworld. Anger, wrath, selfishness and jealousy, have all a certain degree\r\nof vitality. They often produce more show, more noise and temporary\r\nresults, than love. Still, all these passions have, in themselves, the\r\nseeds of weakness. Love, and love only, is immortal; and when all the\r\ngrosser passions of the soul have spent themselves by their own force,\r\nlove looks forth like the unchanging star, with a light that never dies.\r\n\r\nIn undertaking this work, we must love both the slave-holder and the\r\nslave. We must never forget that both are our brethren. We must expect\r\nto be misrepresented, to be slandered, and to be hated. How can we\r\nattack so powerful an interest without it? We must be satisfied simply\r\nwith the pleasure of being true friends, while we are treated as bitter\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nThis holy controversy must be one of principle, and not of sectional\r\nbitterness. We must not suffer it to degenerate, in our hands, into a\r\nviolent prejudice against the South; and, to this end, we must keep\r\ncontinually before our minds the more amiable features and attractive\r\nqualities of those with whose principles we are obliged to conflict. If\r\nthey say all manner of evil against us, we must reflect that we expose\r\nthem to great temptation to do so when we assail institutions to which\r\nthey are bound by a thousand ties of interest and early association, and\r\nto whose evils habit has made them in a great degree insensible. The\r\napostle gives us this direction in cases where we are called upon to\r\ndeal with offending brethren, “Consider thyself, lest thou also be\r\ntempted.” We may apply this to our own case, and consider that if we had\r\nbeen exposed to the temptations which surround our friends at the South,\r\nand received the same education, we might have felt and thought and\r\nacted as they do. But, while we cherish all these considerations, we\r\nmust also remember that it is no love to the South to countenance and\r\ndefend a pernicious system; a system which is as injurious to the master\r\nas to the slave; a system which turns fruitful fields to deserts; a\r\nsystem ruinous to education, to morals, and to religion and social\r\nprogress; a system of which many of the most intelligent and valuable\r\nmen at the South are weary, and from which they desire to escape, and by\r\nemigration are yearly escaping. Neither must we concede the rights of\r\nthe slave; for he is also our brother, and there is a reason why we\r\nshould speak for him which does not exist in the case of his master. He\r\nis poor, uneducated and ignorant, and cannot speak for himself. We must,\r\ntherefore, with greater jealousy, guard his rights. Whatever else we\r\ncompromise, we must not compromise the rights of the helpless, nor the\r\neternal principles of rectitude and morality.\r\n\r\nWe must never concede that it is an honorable thing to deprive working\r\nmen of their wages, though, like many other abuses, it is customary,\r\nreputable, and popular, and though amiable men, under the influence of\r\nold prejudices, still continue to do it. Never, not even for a moment,\r\nshould we admit the thought that an heir of God and a joint heir of\r\nJesus Christ may lawfully be sold upon the auction-block, though it be a\r\ncommon custom. We must repudiate, with determined severity, the\r\nblasphemous doctrine of property in human beings.\r\n\r\nSome have supposed it an absurd refinement to talk about separating\r\nprinciples and persons, or to admit that he who upholds a bad system can\r\nbe a good man. All experience proves the contrary. Systems most unjust\r\nand despotic have been defended by men personally just and humane. It is\r\na melancholy consideration, but no less true, that there is almost no\r\nabsurdity and no injustice that has not, at some period of the world’s\r\nhistory, had the advantage of some good man’s virtues in its support.\r\n\r\nIt is a part of our trial in this imperfect life;—were evil systems only\r\nsupported by the evil, our moral discipline would be much less severe\r\nthan it is, and our course in attacking error far plainer.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we cannot but think that there was much Christian wisdom\r\nin the remark, which we have before quoted, of a poor old slave-woman,\r\nwhose whole life had been darkened by this system, that we must “_hate\r\nthe sin, but love the sinner_.”\r\n\r\nThe last means for the abolition of slavery is the “Armor of\r\nRighteousness on the right hand and on the left.”\r\n\r\nBy this we mean an earnest application of all straight-forward,\r\nhonorable and just measures, for the removal of the system of slavery.\r\nEvery man, in his place, should remonstrate against it. All its\r\nsophistical arguments should be answered, its biblical defences unmasked\r\nby correct reasoning and interpretation. Every mother should teach the\r\nevil of it to her children. Every clergyman should fully and continually\r\nwarn his church against any complicity with such a sin. It is said that\r\nthis would be introducing politics into the pulpit. It is answered, that\r\nsince people will have to give an account of their political actions in\r\nthe day of judgment, it seems proper that the minister should instruct\r\nthem somewhat as to their political responsibilities. In that day Christ\r\nwill ask no man whether he was of this or that party; but he certainly\r\nwill ask him whether he gave his vote in the fear of God, and for the\r\nadvancement of the kingdom of righteousness.\r\n\r\nIt is often objected that slavery is a distant sin, with which we have\r\nnothing to do. If any clergyman wishes to test this fact, let him once\r\nplainly and faithfully preach upon it. He will probably then find that\r\nthe roots of the poison-tree have run under the very hearth-stone of New\r\nEngland families, and that in his very congregation are those in\r\ncomplicity with this sin.\r\n\r\nIt is no child’s play to attack an institution which has absorbed into\r\nitself so much of the political power and wealth of this nation, and\r\nthey who try it will soon find that they wrestle “not with flesh and\r\nblood.” No armor will do for this warfare but the “armor of\r\nrighteousness.”\r\n\r\nTo our brethren in the South God has pointed out a more arduous\r\nconflict. The very heart shrinks to think what the faithful Christian\r\nmust endure who assails this institution on its own ground; but it _must\r\nbe done_. How was it at the North? There was a universal effort to put\r\ndown the discussion of it here by mob law. Printing-presses were broken,\r\nhouses torn down, property destroyed. Brave men, however, stood firm;\r\nmartyr blood was shed for the right of free opinion and speech; and so\r\nthe right of discussion was established. Nobody tries that sort of\r\nargument now,—its day is past. In Kentucky, also, they tried to stop the\r\ndiscussion by similar means. Mob violence destroyed a printing-press,\r\nand threatened the lives of individuals. But there were brave men there,\r\nwho feared not violence or threats of death; and emancipation is now\r\nopen for discussion in Kentucky. The fact is, the South _must_ discuss\r\nthe matter of slavery. She _cannot_ shut it out, unless she lays an\r\nembargo on the literature of the whole civilized world. If it be,\r\nindeed, divine and God-appointed, why does she so tremble to have it\r\ntouched? If it be of God, all the free inquiry in the world cannot\r\noverthrow it. Discussion must and will come. It only requires courageous\r\nmen to lead the way.\r\n\r\nBrethren in the South, there are many of you who are truly convinced\r\nthat slavery is a sin, a tremendous wrong: but, if you confess your\r\nsentiments, and endeavor to propagate your opinions, you think that\r\npersecution, affliction, and even death, await you. How can we ask you,\r\nthen, to come forward? _We_ do not ask it. Ourselves weak, irresolute\r\nand worldly, shall we ask you to do what perhaps we ourselves should not\r\ndare? But we will beseech _Him_ to speak to you, who dared and endured\r\nmore than this for your sake, and who can strengthen you to dare and\r\nendure for His. He can raise you above all temporary and worldly\r\nconsiderations. He can inspire you with that love to himself which will\r\nmake you willing to leave father and mother, and wife and child, yea, to\r\ngive up life itself, for his sake. And if he ever brings you to that\r\nplace where you and this world take a final farewell of each other,\r\nwhere you make up your mind solemnly to give all up for his cause, where\r\nneither life nor death, nor things present nor things to come, can move\r\nyou from this purpose,—then will you know a joy which is above all other\r\njoy, a peace constant and unchanging as the eternal God from whom it\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\nDear brethren, is this system to go on forever in your land? Can you\r\nthink these slave-laws anything but an abomination to a just God? Can\r\nyou think this internal slave-trade to be anything but an abomination in\r\nhis sight?\r\n\r\nLook, we beseech you, into those awful slave-prisons which are in your\r\ncities. Do the groans and prayers which go up from those dreary mansions\r\npromise well for the prosperity of our country?\r\n\r\nLook, we beseech you, at the mournful march of the slave-coffles; follow\r\nthe bloody course of the slave-ships on your coast. What, suppose you,\r\ndoes the Lamb of God think of all these things? He whose heart was so\r\ntender that he wept, at the grave of Lazarus, over a sorrow that he was\r\nso soon to turn into joy,—what does he think of this constant,\r\nheart-breaking, yearly-repeated anguish? What does he think of Christian\r\nwives forced from their husbands, and husbands from their wives? What\r\ndoes he think of Christian daughters, whom his church first educates,\r\nindoctrinates and baptizes, and then leaves to be sold as merchandise?\r\n\r\nThink you such prayers as poor Paul Edmondson’s, such death-bed scenes\r\nas Emily Russell’s, are witnessed without emotion by that generous\r\nSaviour, who regards what is done to his meanest servant as done to\r\nhimself?\r\n\r\nDid it never seem to you, O Christian! when you have read the sufferings\r\nof Jesus, that you would gladly have suffered with him? Does it never\r\nseem almost ungenerous to accept eternal life as the price of such\r\nanguish on his part, while you bear no cross for him? Have you ever\r\nwished you could have watched with him in that bitter conflict at\r\nGethsemane, when even his chosen slept? Have you ever wished that you\r\ncould have stood by him when all forsook him and fled,—that you could\r\nhave owned when Peter denied,—that you could have honored him when\r\nbuffeted and spit upon? Would you think it too much honor, could you,\r\nlike Mary, have followed him to the cross, and stood a patient sharer of\r\nthat despised, unpitied agony? _That_ you cannot do. That hour is over.\r\nChrist, now, is exalted, crowned, glorified,—all men speak well of him;\r\nrich churches rise to him, and costly sacrifice goes up to him. What\r\nchance have you, among the multitude, to prove your love,—to show that\r\nyou would stand by him discrowned, dishonored, tempted, betrayed, and\r\nsuffering? Can you show it in any way but by espousing the cause of his\r\nsuffering poor? Is there a people among you despised and rejected of\r\nmen, heavy with oppression, acquainted with grief, with all the power of\r\nwealth and fashion, of political and worldly influence, arrayed against\r\ntheir cause,—Christian, you can acknowledge Christ in them!\r\n\r\nIf you turn away indifferent from this cause,—“if thou forbear to\r\ndeliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that be ready to be\r\nslain; if thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not, doth not he that\r\npondereth the heart consider it, and he that keepeth the soul, doth he\r\nnot know it, shall he not render to every man according to his works?”\r\n\r\nIn the last judgment will He not say to you, “I have been in the\r\nslave-prison,—in the slave-coffle. I have been sold in your markets; I\r\nhave toiled for naught in your fields; I have been smitten on the mouth\r\nin your courts of justice; I have been denied a hearing in my own\r\nchurch,—and ye cared not for it. Ye went, one to his farm, and another\r\nto his merchandise.” And if ye shall answer, “_When_, Lord?” He shall\r\nsay unto you, “Inasmuch as ye have done it to the least of these, my\r\nbrethren, ye have done it unto me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n            FACT _vs._ FIGURES; OR, THE NINE ARAB BROTHERS.\r\n               BEING A NEW ARABIAN NIGHT’S ENTERTAINMENT.\r\n\r\nIt is a favorite maxim that “_figures cannot lie_.” We are loth to\r\nassail the time-honored reputation for veracity of this ancient and most\r\nrespectable race. There may have been days of pastoral innocence and\r\nprimitive simplicity, when they did not lie. When Abraham sat\r\ncontemplatively in his tent-door, with nothing to do, all the long day,\r\nbut compose psalms and pious meditations, it is likely that he had\r\nimplicit faith in this maxim, and never thought of questioning the\r\nstatistical tables of Eliezer of Damascus, with regard to the number of\r\ncamels, asses, sheep, oxen and goats, which illustrated the prairie\r\nwhere he was for the time being encamped. Alas for those good old days!\r\nFigures did not lie then, we freely admit; but we are sadly afraid, from\r\ntheir behavior in recent ages, that this arose from no native innocence\r\nof disposition, but simply from want of occasion and opportunity. In\r\nthose days, they were young and green, and had not learned what they\r\ncould do. The first inventor, who commenced making a numeration table,\r\nwith the artless primeval machine of his toes and fingers, had, like\r\nother great inventors, very little idea of what he was doing, and what\r\nwould be the mighty uses of these very simple characters, when men got\r\nto having republican governments, and elections, and discussions of all\r\nsorts of unheard-of questions in politics and morals, and to\r\nelectioneering among these poor simple Arab herdsmen, the nine digits,\r\nfor their votes on all these complicated subjects. No wonder that\r\nfigures have had their heads turned! Such unprecedented power and\r\npopularity is enough to turn any head. We are sorry to speak ill of\r\nthem; but really we must say, that, like many of our political men, they\r\nhave been found on all sides of every subject to an extent that is\r\nreally very confusing. Of course, there is no doubt of their veracity\r\n_somewhere_; the only problem being, on which side, and where. Is any\r\ngreat measure to be carried, now-a-days? Of course, the statistics, cut\r\nand dried, in regular columns, on both sides of the question, contradict\r\neach other point-blank as two opposite cannons; and each party marshals\r\nbehind them, firing them off with infinite alacrity, but with no\r\nparticular effect, except the bewilderment of the few old-fashioned\r\npeople, who, like Mr. Pickwick at the review, stand on the middle\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIf that most respectable female person, Mrs. Partington, who, like most\r\nunsophisticated old ladies, is a most vehement and uncompromising\r\nabolitionist, could only hear the statistics that are to be shown up in\r\nfavor of slavery, she would take off her spectacles and wipe her eyes in\r\npious joy, and think that the millennium, and nothing less, had come\r\nupon earth. Such statistics they are, about the woe, and want, and\r\nagony, and heathenish darkness of Africa, which, by that eminent foreign\r\nmissionary operation, the slave-trade, have been turned into light and\r\njoy and thanksgiving; here she has them, in round figures; she only\r\nneeds to put on her spectacles and look. “Here, ma’am, you have it,”\r\nsays the illustrator; “look on this side of the column: here are three\r\nhundred million of heathen,—don’t spare the figures,—down in Africa,\r\nsunk in heathenism—never heard the sound of the gospel—actually eating\r\neach other alive. Now, turn to this side of the column, and here they\r\nall are, over in America, clothed and in their right mind, going to\r\nchurch with their masters, and finding the hymns in their own\r\nhymn-books. Now, ma’am, can you doubt the beneficial results of the\r\nslave-trade?”\r\n\r\nBut Mrs Partington has heard something about that middle passage which\r\nshe thought was horrid.\r\n\r\n“By no means, my dear madam,” says the illustrator, whisking over his\r\npapers. “I have that all in figures,—average of deaths in the first\r\ncargoes, 25 _per cent._,—large average, certainly; they didn’t manage\r\nthe business exactly right; but then the rate of increase in a Christian\r\ncountry averages twenty-five per cent. over what it would have been in\r\nAfrica. Now, Mrs. Partington, if these had been left in Africa, they\r\nwould have been all heathen; by getting them over here, you have just as\r\nmany, and all Christians to boot. Because, you see, the excess of\r\nincrease balances the percentage of loss, and we make no deduction for\r\ninterest in those cases.”\r\n\r\nNow, as Mrs. Partington does not know with very great clearness what\r\n“percentage” and “average” mean, and as mental philosophers have\r\ndemonstrated that we are always powerfully affected by the unknown, she\r\nis all the more impressed with this reasoning, on that account; being\r\none of the simple, old-fashioned people, who have not yet gotten over\r\nthe impression that “figures cannot lie.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now, really,” says she, “strange what these figures will do! I\r\nalways thought the slave-trade was monstrous wicked. But it really,\r\nseems to be quite a missionary work.”\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that these nomadic Arabs, the digits, are making a very\r\nunfair use, among us, of the family reputation gotten up during the\r\npalmy days of their innocence, when they were a breezy, contemplatively\r\nunsophisticated race of shepherds, and, to use an American elegance of\r\nexpression, had not yet “cut their eye-teeth.” All that remains of their\r\nOriental origin in this country seems to be a characteristic turn for\r\nromancing. Not an addition of slave territory has been made to the\r\nUnited States, wherein these same Arab brothers have not, with grave\r\nfaces, been brought in as witnesses, to swear, by the honor of the\r\nfamily, that it was absolutely essential, for the best interest of the\r\nAfrican race, that there should be more slavery and more slave\r\nterritory. To be sure, it was for the pecuniary gain of the _American_\r\nrace, but that was not the point insisted on. O no! we are always very\r\nglad when our interest coincides with that of the African race; but the\r\nextension of slavery is not to be considered in that light principally;\r\nit is entirely a system of Christian education, and evangelization of\r\none race by another. Left to himself, Quashy goes right back into\r\nheathenism. His very body deteriorates; he becomes idiotic, insane,\r\ndeaf, dumb, blind,—everything that can be thought of. “Is this an actual\r\nfact?” asks some incredulous Congress man, as innocent as Mrs.\r\nPartington. “O yes! for only look; here are the statistics. Just see;\r\nhere in the town of Kittery, in Maine, are twenty-seven insane and\r\nidiotic black people, and down here in the town of Dittery, South\r\nCarolina, not a single one. Some simple-minded Kittery man, who\r\noverhears this conversation in the lobby, perhaps opens his eyes, and\r\nreflects with wonder that he never knew that there were so many black\r\npeople in the town. But the Congress man shows it to him in the census,\r\nand he concludes to look for them when he goes home, as figures cannot\r\nlie.”\r\n\r\nOn the census of 1840 conclusions innumerable as to the capacity of the\r\ncolored race to subsist in freedom have been based. It has been the very\r\nbeetle, sledge-hammer and broad-axe; and when all other means fail, the\r\nobjector, with a triumphant flourish, exclaims, “There, sir, what do you\r\nthink of the census of 1840? You see, sir, the thing’s been tried, and\r\nit’s _no go_.” We poor common folks cannot tell what to think. Some of\r\nus suppose that we know that there were more insane and idiotic and\r\nvariously dilapidated negroes reported in certain states than their\r\nentire negro population. But, of course, as it’s down in the census, and\r\nas “figures never lie,” we must believe our own eyes. We can only say\r\nwhat some people have thought.\r\n\r\nThat most inconvenient and pertinacious man, John Quincy Adams, made a\r\ngood deal of trouble in Congress about this same matter. At no less than\r\nfive different times did this very persistent old gentleman rise in\r\nCongress, with the statement that the returns of the census had been\r\nnotoriously and grossly falsified in this respect; and that he was\r\nprepared, if leave were given, to present before the House the most\r\ncomplete, direct, and overwhelming evidence to this effect. The\r\nfollowing is an account of Mr. Adams’ endeavors on this subject,\r\ncollected from the _Congressional Globe_, and _Niles’s Register_:\r\n\r\n              TWENTY-EIGHTH CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. _February 26, 1844._—Mr. Adams, on leave,\r\n  offered the following resolution:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the Secretary of State be directed to inform this\r\n  House whether any gross errors have been discovered in the “Sixth\r\n  Census, or Enumeration of the Inhabitants of the United States, as\r\n  corrected at the Department of State in 1841,” and, if so, how these\r\n  errors originated, what they are, and what, if any, measures have\r\n  been taken to rectify them.\r\n\r\n  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. _May 6, 1844._—The journal having been\r\n  read, Mr. Adams moved a correction of the same by striking out from\r\n  the communication of the Secretary of State (in answer to a\r\n  resolution of this House inquiring whether any gross errors had been\r\n  discovered in the printing of the Sixth Census), as copied upon the\r\n  journal, the following words: “That no such errors had been\r\n  discovered.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Adams accompanied his motion with some remarks. It could not\r\n  possibly (Mr. Adams said) be a correct representation, as very gross\r\n  errors had been discovered, as he intended and would pledge himself\r\n  to show. He said they referred to the number of insane, blind, &c.,\r\n  among the colored population. This had been made the subject of a\r\n  pamphlet on the annexation of Texas, and of a speech by a gentleman\r\n  from Mississippi (Mr. Hammett), which had been refuted on this\r\n  floor. The United States were at this time placed in a condition\r\n  very little short of war with Great Britain, as well as Mexico, on\r\n  the foundation of these very errors. It was important, therefore,\r\n  that the true state of facts should be made to appear.\r\n\r\n  The Speaker remarked that whether errors existed or not would be\r\n  matter of investigation. In the opinion of the chair, there was no\r\n  error of the journal, because it contained only a faithful\r\n  transcript of the communication made by the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Adams persisted in his motion. It was (he said) the most\r\n  extraordinary communication ever made from the State Department. He\r\n  would pledge himself to produce documents to prove that gross errors\r\n  did exist. He would produce such proof as no man would be able to\r\n  contradict.\r\n\r\n  The House refused to amend the journal.\r\n\r\n  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. _May 16, 1844._—Mr. Adams wished to\r\n  present a memorial from certain citizens in relation to errors which\r\n  they say have been committed in compiling and printing the last\r\n  census of the United States.\r\n\r\n  Objection being made, he moved to suspend the rules for the purpose\r\n  of offering the resolution, and moving to refer it to a committee of\r\n  five members. The yeas and nays were ordered, and, being taken, the\r\n  rules were not suspended,—ayes 96, nays 49,—less than two-thirds\r\n  voting in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. _Dec. 10, 1844._—Mr. Adams presented a\r\n  petition from the American Statistical Society, in relation to\r\n  certain errors in the last or sixth census.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Adams said a petition on this subject at the last session was\r\n  referred to a select committee, and he hoped this petition would\r\n  take the same direction. He moved the appointment of a select\r\n  committee of nine members, and that the memorial be printed.\r\n\r\n  The speaker announced that a majority had decided in favor of a\r\n  select committee. The motion to print was laid on the table.\r\n\r\n  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. _Dec. 13, 1844._—The following is the\r\n  Select Committee appointed, on the motion of Mr. Adams, to consider\r\n  the petition from the American Statistical Society in relation to\r\n  the errors in the sixth census: Messrs. Adams, Rhett, Rayner,\r\n  Stiles, Maclay, Brengle, Foster, Sheppard, Cary, and Caleb B. Smith.\r\n\r\nThis was the end of the affair in Congress. _The false returns stand to\r\nthis day in the statistical tables of the census_, to convince all\r\ncavillers of the unfitness of the negro for freedom. That the reader may\r\nknow what kind of evidence Mr. Adams had with which to sustain his\r\nallegations, we append, as a specimen, an extract from the American\r\nAlmanac for 1845, p. 156.\r\n\r\n  The “American Statistical Association,” established in Boston,\r\n  Mass., sent a memorial to Congress during the past winter, drawn up\r\n  by Messrs. William Brigham, Edward Jarvis, and J. W. Thornton, in\r\n  which, though they “confined their investigations to the reports\r\n  respecting education and nosology,” they exposed an extraordinary\r\n  mass of errors in the census. We can find room only for a few\r\n  extracts from this memorial.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “The most glaring and remarkable errors are found in the statements\r\n  respecting nosology, the prevalence of insanity, blindness, deafness\r\n  and dumbness, among the people of this nation.\r\n\r\n  “The undersigned have compared these statements with information\r\n  obtained from other more reliable sources, and have found them\r\n  widely varying from the truth; and, more than all, they have\r\n  compared the statements in one part of the census with those in\r\n  another part, and have found most extraordinary discrepances. They\r\n  have also examined the original manuscript copy of the census,\r\n  deposited by the marshal of the District of Massachusetts in the\r\n  clerk’s office in Boston, and have compared this with the printed\r\n  edition of both Blair and Rives, and Thomas Allen, and found here,\r\n  too, a variance of statements.\r\n\r\n  “Your memorialists are aware that some of these errors in respect to\r\n  Massachusetts, and perhaps also in respect to other states, were\r\n  committed by the marshals. Mr. William H. Williams, deputy marshal,\r\n  states that there were one hundred and thirty-three colored pauper\r\n  lunatics in the family of Samuel B. Woodward, in the town of\r\n  Worcester; but on another page he states that there are no colored\r\n  persons in said Woodward’s family.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Benali Blood, deputy marshal, states, on one page, that there\r\n  were fourteen colored pauper lunatics and two colored lunatics, who\r\n  were supported at private charge, in the family of Charles E.\r\n  Parker, in the town of Pepperell; while on another page he states\r\n  that there are no colored persons in the family of said Parker. Mr.\r\n  William M. Packson states, on one page, that there are in the family\r\n  of Jacob Cushman, in the town of Plympton, four pauper colored\r\n  lunatics, and one colored blind person; while on another page he\r\n  states that there are no colored persons in the family of said\r\n  Cushman.\r\n\r\n  “But, on comparing the manuscript copy of the census at Boston with\r\n  the printed edition of Blair and Rives, the undersigned are\r\n  convinced that a large portion of the errors were made by the\r\n  printers, and that hardly any of the errors of the original document\r\n  are left out. The original document finds the colored insane in\r\n  twenty-nine towns, while the printed edition of Blair and Rives\r\n  places them in thirty-five towns, and each makes them more than\r\n  ten-fold greater than the state returns in regard to the paupers.\r\n  And one edition has given twenty, and the other twenty-seven,\r\n  self-supporting lunatics, in towns in which, according to private\r\n  inquiry, none are to be found. According to the original and\r\n  manuscript copy of the census, there were in Massachusetts ten deaf\r\n  and dumb and eight blind colored persons; whereas the printed\r\n  editions of the same document multiply them into seventeen of the\r\n  former and twenty-two of the latter class of unfortunates.\r\n\r\n  “The printed copy of the census declares that there were in the\r\n  towns of Hingham and Scituate nineteen colored persons who were deaf\r\n  and dumb, blind, or insane. On the other hand, the undersigned are\r\n  informed, by the overseers of the poor and the assessors, who have\r\n  cognizance of every pauper and tax-payer in the town, that in the\r\n  last twelve years no such diseased persons have lived in the town of\r\n  Scituate; and they have equally certain proof that none such have\r\n  lived in Hingham. Moreover, the deputy marshals neither found nor\r\n  made record of such persons.\r\n\r\n  “The undersigned have carefully compared the number of colored\r\n  insane and idiots, and of the deaf and dumb and blind, with the\r\n  whole number of the colored population, as stated in the printed\r\n  edition of the census, in every city, town, and county of the United\r\n  States; and have found the extraordinary contradictions and\r\n  improbabilities that are shown in the following tables.\r\n\r\n  “The errors of the census are as certain, if not as manifest, in\r\n  regard to the insanity among the whites, as among the colored\r\n  people. Wherever your memorialists have been able to compare the\r\n  census with the results of the investigations of the state\r\n  governments, of individuals, or societies, they have found that the\r\n  national enumeration has fallen far short of the more probable\r\n  amount.\r\n\r\n  “According to the census, there were in Massachusetts six hundred\r\n  and twenty-seven lunatics and idiots supported at public charge;\r\n  according to the returns of the overseers of the poor, there were\r\n  eight hundred and twenty-seven of this class of paupers.\r\n\r\n  “The superintendents of the poor of the State of New York report one\r\n  thousand and fifty-eight pauper lunatics within that state; the\r\n  census reports only seven hundred and thirty-nine.\r\n\r\n  “The government of New Jersey reports seven hundred and one in that\r\n  state; the census discovers only four hundred and forty-two.\r\n\r\n  “The Medical Society of Connecticut discovered twice as many\r\n  lunatics as the census within that state. A similar discrepancy was\r\n  found in Eastern Pennsylvania, and also in some counties in\r\n  Virginia.\r\n\r\n  “Your memorialists deem it needless to go further into detail in\r\n  this matter. Suffice it to say, that these are but specimens of the\r\n  errors that are to be found in the ‘sixth census’ in regard to\r\n  nosology and education, and they suspect also in regard to other\r\n  matters therein reported.\r\n\r\n  “In view of these facts, the undersigned, in behalf of said\r\n  Association, conceive that such documents ought not to have the\r\n  sanction of Congress, nor ought they to be regarded as containing\r\n  true statements relative to the condition of the people and the\r\n  resources of the United States. They believe it would have been far\r\n  better to have had no census at all than such an one as has been\r\n  published; and they respectfully request your honorable body to take\r\n  such order thereon, and to adopt such measures for the correction of\r\n  the same,—or, if the same cannot be corrected, for discarding and\r\n  disowning the same,—as the good of the country shall require, and as\r\n  justice and humanity shall demand.\r\n\r\n  “We have room for the tables for only three of the states.” [We will\r\n  caution the reader not to skip this statistical table, as he\r\n  probably never saw one like it before.]\r\n\r\n                                 MAINE.\r\n\r\n               Towns.
