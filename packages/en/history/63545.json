No method of taking the impressions simpler than\r\nthat employed by him can be imagined, unless it be with a “buffer,”\r\nor by means of a brush rubbed over the paper laid upon the “form”\r\nof type, after the manner of the Chinese in printing from engraved\r\nblocks. His printing press consisted of two upright timbers, with\r\ncross pieces of wood to stay them together at the top and bottom.\r\nThere were also intermediate cross timbers, one of which supported\r\nthe flat “bed” upon which the type was placed, and through another\r\na wooden screw passed, its lower point resting on the centre of a\r\nwooden “platen,” which was thus screwed down upon the type. After\r\ninking the form with a ball of leather stuffed with wool, the printer\r\nspread the paper over it, laying a piece of blanket upon the paper to\r\nsoften the impression of the platen and remove inequalities. This was\r\nthe machine which Gutenberg used. The mechanical principle embodied\r\nin it was found in the old cheese and linen presses ordinarily seen\r\nin the houses of medieval times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EARLIEST FORM OF PRINTING PRESS]\r\n\r\nWere Gutenberg called upon to print his Bible to-day he would find\r\nvirtually the same type ready for his purpose as that made by\r\nhim, no change having taken place in its general conformation; but\r\nhe would be bewildered in the maze of printing machinery of the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nThe simple form of wooden press, worked with a screw by means of a\r\nmovable bar, continued in use for about one hundred and fifty years,\r\nor until the early part of the seventeenth century, without any\r\nmaterial change. The forms of type were placed upon the same wooden\r\nand sometimes stone beds, incased in frames called “coffins,” moved\r\nin and out laboriously by hand, and after each impression the platen\r\nhad to be screwed up with the bar so that the paper which had been\r\nprinted upon it might be removed and hung up to dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLAEW PRESS]\r\n\r\nThe first recorded improvements in this press were made by William\r\nJensen Blaew, a printer of Amsterdam, some time about 1620. They\r\nconsisted in passing the spindle of the screw through a square block\r\nwhich was guided in the wooden frame, and from this block the platen\r\nwas suspended by wires or cords; the block, or box, preventing any\r\ntwist in the platen, and insuring a more equal motion to the screw.\r\nHe also placed a device upon the press for rolling in and out the\r\nbed, and added a new form of iron hand lever for turning the screw.\r\nBlaew’s press was introduced into England, and used there as well\r\nas on the continent, being substantially the same as that Benjamin\r\nFranklin worked upon as a journeyman in London, early in the last\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STANHOPE PRESS]\r\n\r\nLittle further improvement was made in the printing press before\r\nthe year 1798, when the Earl of Stanhope caused one to be made,\r\nthe frame of which, instead of being of wood, was one piece of\r\ncast-iron. A necessity had arisen for greater power in giving the\r\nimpression, especially in the printing of woodcuts, and the tendency\r\nwas naturally toward larger forms of type, requiring greater exertion\r\non the part of the printer; the labor in working one of the old\r\nscrew presses was about equal to that of the plowman in the field.\r\nThe Earl of Stanhope reserved the screw, but caused to be added a\r\ncombination of levers to assist the pressman in gaining greater\r\npower, when giving the impression, with less expenditure of energy.\r\nThese machines were very heavy and extremely cumbersome. They were\r\nthe first iron printing presses ever constructed, and came into\r\nuse to some extent. The printers, seizing upon this new idea of a\r\ncombination of levers to increase the power, were induced to place\r\nthem upon their wooden presses, the improvement resulting generally\r\nin the destruction of the latter, which were not adapted to stand\r\nthe strain. The iron platen employed by the Earl of Stanhope had,\r\nhowever, previously been used upon the wooden presses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLYMER’S COLUMBIAN PRESS]\r\n\r\nThe next practical improvement was made by George Clymer of\r\nPhiladelphia, who, about 1816, devised an iron machine, entirely\r\ndispensing with a screw. A long, heavy cast-iron lever was placed\r\nover the platen, one end attached to one of the uprights of the\r\ncast-iron frame, and the other susceptible of being raised and\r\nlowered by a combination of smaller levers, worked by the pressman\r\nafter the manner of the ordinary hand press. The impression was given\r\nand the platen raised and lowered by a spindle, or pin, attached to\r\nthe centre of the large cross lever at the top, this being properly\r\nbalanced to facilitate its being raised with greater ease. Mr. Clymer\r\ncarried his invention to England, where it was introduced to some\r\nextent and was known as the “Columbian” press.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETER SMITH HAND PRESS]\r\n\r\nIn England there were iron hand presses made by Rutheven, by Brown\r\nand by others, all, more or less, improvements upon the Stanhope.\r\n\r\nIn 1822 Peter Smith, an American, connected with the firm of R. Hoe\r\n& Co. in New York, devised a machine which was in many respects\r\nsuperior to any up to that time. The frame was of cast-iron, and in\r\nplace of the screw with levers, he substituted a toggle joint, at\r\nonce simple and effective.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, however, Samuel Rust of New York, perfected an invention\r\nwhich was a great improvement on the Smith press. The frame, instead\r\nof being all of cast-iron, had the uprights at the sides hollowed\r\nfor the admission of wrought-iron bars, which were securely\r\nriveted at the top and bottom of the casting. This gave not only\r\nadditional strength, but greatly diminished the amount of metal used\r\nin construction. This patent was purchased by R. Hoe & Co., who\r\nimproved upon it, and proceeded with the manufacture of the presses,\r\nalthough the “Smith” continued to be used to some extent. The new\r\ninvention was known as the “Washington” press, and in principle\r\nand construction has never been surpassed by any hand printing\r\nmachine. They were manufactured in great numbers, and continue to be\r\nmanufactured and sold at the present time for taking fine proofs,\r\nalthough the universal adoption of the cylinder press has almost\r\nentirely superseded them for other printing. The number made and sold\r\nby Hoe & Co. alone, a majority of which are now in use, is over six\r\nthousand. They have been sent all over the world. This style of press\r\nis made in seven sizes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHINGTON HAND PRESS]\r\n\r\nThe following is a description of this press: The bed slides on a\r\ntrack and is run in and out from under the platen by turning a crank\r\nwhich has belts attached to a pulley upon its shaft. The impression\r\nof the platen is given by means of a curved lever acting on a toggle\r\njoint, and the platen is lifted by springs on either side. Attached\r\nto the bed is a “tympan” frame covered with cloth, and standing\r\ninclined, to receive the sheet to be printed. Another frame, called\r\nthe “frisket,” is attached to the tympan, and covered with a sheet\r\nof paper, having the parts which otherwise would be printed upon cut\r\naway, so as to prevent the “chase” and “furniture” from blacking\r\nor soiling the sheet. The frisket is turned down over the sheet\r\nand tympan and all are folded down when the impression is taken.\r\nAutomatic inking rollers were attached to this machine, operated by a\r\nweight raised by the pull of the pressman, the descent of the weight\r\ndrawing the rollers over the type and returning them to the inking\r\ncylinder while the pressman placed another sheet upon the tympan.\r\nStill further improvements in this inking apparatus were made and\r\npatented by Hoe & Co., in which the distribution of the ink on the\r\nrollers was effected by means of an apparatus driven by steam power\r\nand which also caused the inking rollers to move forward over the\r\ntype at the will of the pressman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TREADWELL’S WOODEN-FRAME BED AND PLATEN POWER PRESS]\r\n\r\nThe bed and platen system of printing was, up to the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, the favorite method of printing fine books and\r\ncuts. The first “power” or steam press upon this principle was made\r\nby Daniel Treadwell, of Boston, in 1822. The frames were of wood, and\r\nit does not appear that more than three or four of these were ever\r\nconstructed. The best machines of this description were those devised\r\nand patented by Isaac Adams, of Boston, in 1830 and 1836, and by Otis\r\nTufts, of the same place, in 1834. They were first made with wooden\r\nand afterward with iron frames. In 1858 Adams’s business became the\r\nproperty of Hoe & Co., who continued to manufacture the machines with\r\nadded improvements. In all more than a thousand, in no less than\r\nfifty-seven sizes, were sold for use in the United States, some being\r\nsent to other countries. In these machines, the type is placed upon\r\nan iron bed, after the usual manner of the hand press, and this bed\r\nis raised and lowered by straightening and bending a toggle joint\r\nby means of a cam, thus giving the impression upon the iron platen\r\nfixed above it, and firmly held in position by upright iron rods\r\nsecured to the bottom bar, a strong cross-piece, at the base of the\r\nmachine. The ink fountain is at one end of the press; the inking\r\nrollers travel twice over the form, in a movable frisket frame, while\r\nthe bed is down; the paper is taken in by grippers on the frisket\r\nand carried over the form, when the bed rises and the impression is\r\ngiven; and finally the sheets pass forward from the frisket by tapes\r\nto a sheet flier, which delivers them on the fly board. One thousand\r\nsheets per hour is the maximum speed of the larger sizes of the Adams\r\npress. Although many of these machines were made and great numbers\r\nare still used, and notwithstanding the fact that it was thought by\r\nmany experienced printers that fine book and cut work could be done\r\nin no other way than by flat pressure, this system of printing has\r\ngiven place to that of the cylinder press.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ISAAC ADAMS’S BED AND PLATEN PRESS]\r\n\r\nThe idea of printing from plates or forms carried upon a flat\r\nbed beneath a cylinder was not a new one, having been employed\r\nby printers of copper-plate engravings in the fifteenth century.\r\nTheir machines, however, were rude in form, and made of wood, the\r\nroller revolving in stationary bearings, while the bed, with the\r\nplate upon it and carrying the paper, covered by a blanket, on its\r\nsurface, moved backward and forward under the roller. The inking was\r\ndone by hand with balls. With the inauguration of this system of\r\nprinting from type or forms placed upon a flat bed moved forwards\r\nand backwards under a revolving cylinder, commenced an entirely new\r\nera in the history of the printing press. It should be understood,\r\nhowever, that the vast number of patents granted for printing\r\nmachines in which the cylinder is connected with the bed, or by\r\nthe operation of two cylinders together, one holding the form and\r\nthe other giving the impression, are almost all for improvements\r\nand devices of detail, the radical principles upon which these are\r\nfounded remaining the same. Thus, Sir Rowland Hill, in the early\r\npart of the nineteenth century, projected a machine for printing from\r\nan endless roll, or “web” of paper; and in 1790 an Englishman named\r\nWilliam Nicholson (author, inventor, patent agent, editor and school\r\nteacher) took out a patent covering the idea of cylinder presses in\r\nwhich the forms should be placed upon either a flat bed or cylinder\r\nat will and receive the impression from a cylinder covered with cloth\r\nor some similar material. Between the bed and cylinder, or between\r\nthe two cylinders, the sheet was to be fed in and printed. The ink\r\nwas to be put on by a roller built up of cloth and covered with\r\nleather. There is, however, a great difference between an actual\r\ninvention and a scheme. If the simple proposition advanced to make a\r\nmachine upon this principle, without its consummation, or without any\r\npress being produced, can be considered an invention, then Nicholson\r\nmay (as a writer on the subject states) have been “so far ahead of\r\nhis time as to leap over three generations” by his invention. As a\r\nmatter of fact, however, his patents were mostly schemes, and little\r\nmore, as a moment’s reflection will convince. He did not know how\r\nto curve the plates to be put upon the cylinders, nor how to secure\r\nthem properly for good work--in fact, he did not know how to make the\r\nplates in any practicable manner. All these questions remained to be\r\nsolved in order that the printing press might be an invention. On\r\nthis account, therefore, I do not give descriptions of proposals to\r\nmake machines, but of presses that have been actually made, and used\r\nsufficiently to entitle them to recognition as practical improvements\r\nexemplifying the progressive evolution of the printing press.\r\n\r\nThe foundation and growth of newspapers first published periodically,\r\nand finally each day, created a demand for machines which should\r\nprint with rapidity, and fine work was delegated for the time being\r\nto the flat bed and platen press, most of it, as has been seen, being\r\nturned out upon the hand press.\r\n\r\nThe credit of actually introducing into use a flat bed Cylinder\r\nPress is due to a Saxon named Friederich Koenig, who visited England\r\nin 1806, and through the assistance of Thomas Bensley, a printer\r\nin London, devised a machine which in 1812-1813 was worked by him,\r\nand printed, among other publications, a part of “Clarkson’s Life\r\nof William Penn.” Koenig was assisted by a mechanic named Andrew\r\nBauer, a fellow-countryman. The form of type was placed on a flat\r\nbed, the cylinder above it having a three-fold motion, or stopping\r\nthree times; the first third of the turn receiving the sheet upon\r\none of the tympans and securing it by the frisket; the second giving\r\nthe impression and allowing the sheet to be removed by hand, and the\r\nthird returning the tympan empty to receive another sheet.\r\n\r\nThese men also devised what has proved, even to this day, to be a\r\nmost efficient reciprocating motion of the type bed. It consists of\r\na pinion carried on the inner end of a long shaft which is turned by\r\ngearing from the outside of the press frame and has in its length a\r\nuniversal joint, allowing an up-and-down motion of the pinion as it\r\nrevolves. To the outer end of the shaft the wheel connecting with\r\nthe impression cylinder is attached. Underneath the bed and fastened\r\nto it is a “rack,” or a row of teeth, with a crescent-shaped segment\r\nof hard metal at each end. In this rack, in addition to the teeth,\r\nare pins, or studs, at each end. The wheel before referred to, at\r\nthe outer end of the shaft, being set in motion revolves the pinion\r\nand moves the bed by means of the teeth in this rack. At the proper\r\nmoment, calling for the reversal of the bed, the pinion turns around\r\nover one of the pins or studs, against the segment on the rack, and\r\nimmediately re-engages its teeth in the opposite side of the rack, so\r\ncarrying the bed back again. This motion is repeated at the opposite\r\nend of the rack, and the bed again stopped and returned by the pinion\r\nrevolving against the segment and again over the rack, thus giving a\r\nreciprocating motion to the bed.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 Koenig patented a continuously revolving Cylinder Press.\r\nThe part of the periphery of the cylinder not used for giving the\r\nimpression is slightly reduced in diameter, so as to allow the form\r\nto return under it freely after giving an impression. He showed\r\ndesigns adapting it for use as a single Cylinder Press, and also a\r\ntwo Cylinder Press, both for printing one side of the paper at a\r\ntime; likewise a two Cylinder Press for printing both sides of the\r\npaper at one operation. In this later press, the two forms were\r\nplaced one at each end of a long bed, and the paper after being\r\nprinted on one side by one cylinder, was carried by tapes over a\r\nregistering roller to the other cylinder, where it was printed\r\nupon the reverse side. This press, termed a “perfecting press,”\r\nwas afterwards improved by Applegath & Cowper so as to be a very\r\nefficient machine.\r\n\r\nKoenig erected in the office of the London “Times” in 1814 two of the\r\ntwo Cylinder Presses mentioned above, which printed on one side of\r\nthe paper only, at the rate of 800 sheets per hour.\r\n\r\nKoenig, however, was not alone in his efforts to perfect a Cylinder\r\nPress. Various patents were gotten out by Bacon & Donkin in 1813; by\r\nCowper in 1816 and again in 1818; and by Applegath in 1818. But the\r\nmost ingenious and practical device in connection with the movements\r\nof a flat bed and a cylinder for printing machines was patented by\r\nNapier in 1828 and 1830. He was the first who introduced “grippers,”\r\nor “fingers,” for the conveyance of the sheets around the cylinder\r\nduring the impression, and for delivering them after printing. Tapes\r\nor strings had previously been employed for this purpose. He was also\r\nthe first to manufacture presses in which the impression cylinders\r\nare of small size and make two or more revolutions to each sheet\r\nprinted, and he devised the toggles for bringing the cylinders down\r\nto print on the form and for raising them to let the form run back\r\nwithout touching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SINGLE SMALL CYLINDER PRESS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE CYLINDER PRESS]\r\n\r\nThe news of these later inventions reached New York in due time,\r\nand in 1832 Robert Hoe, who had been some time established in the\r\nmanufacture of printing presses, sent a young man, Sereno Newton\r\n(whom he afterwards took in partnership with him), to England to\r\ninvestigate the subject and see what improvements were worthy of\r\nadoption. The result was the construction of the machines known as\r\nthe “Single Small Cylinder” and “Double Small Cylinder,” also the\r\nlarge Cylinder “Perfecting” Press, which have continued, with many\r\nalterations and improvements, to be manufactured up to the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SINGLE LARGE CYLINDER PRESS]\r\n\r\nHoe & Co. had previously made the first flat bed and cylinder press\r\never used in the United States. It was the pattern known as the\r\n“Single Large Cylinder,” the whole circumference of the cylinder\r\nbeing equivalent to the entire travel of the bed forwards and\r\nbackwards, the cylinder making one revolution for each impression\r\nin printing, without stopping. Only a portion of the cylinder was\r\nemployed to take the impression, the remainder of its circumference\r\nbeing turned down small enough to allow the type on the bed to pass\r\nback under it without touching. Hundreds of these machines were made\r\nand are now in use, and they are still made at the present day, with\r\npatented sheet fliers and other devices and improvements in the\r\nmethods of manufacture. Other similar presses were made later by\r\nthe press-makers A. B. Taylor, A. Campbell, C. B. Cottrell, and C.\r\nPotter, Jr.\r\n\r\nThe patented sheet flier before referred to, and which was used on\r\nthe “Adams” bed and platen press, was greatly improved by Hoe & Co.\r\nand placed upon all their cylinder presses.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further with an account of the faster newspaper\r\npresses, it may be well to complete the history of machines employed\r\nup to this time for book, job and woodcut printing. For this purpose\r\nthe “Single Large Cylinder,” already described, was first used. In\r\nEngland there were the “Napier” presses, the “Wharfdale” and many\r\nothers, all involving the same general principle, and capable of\r\nturning out more or less satisfactory work, in proportion to the\r\nperfection of their construction and the skill of those operating\r\nthem. Most of the English machines, however, show defects in\r\nmechanical construction. In fact, the supremacy of the American\r\nprinting press is maintained in a large measure by the simplicity,\r\naccuracy and perfection of its mechanism. Foreign presses, made by\r\nthe cheap labor of Europe, have been repeatedly brought to this\r\ncountry and introduced into printing offices. They have never,\r\nhowever, lasted long, most of them having perished in the using or\r\nbeen found unprofitable.\r\n\r\nThere have been various modifications of the principle underlying the\r\nNapier movement for flat-bed presses, i. e., having the driving wheel\r\nengage the rack at all times, reversing the movement by turning about\r\nthe ends of the rack and driving the bed alternately in opposite\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1847 Hoe & Co. patented an entirely new bed driving\r\nmechanism. To a hanger fixed on the lower side of the bed were\r\nattached two racks facing each other, but not in the same vertical\r\nplane, and separated by a distance equal to the diameter of the\r\ndriving wheel, which was on a horizontal shaft and movable sideways\r\nso as to engage in either one or other of the racks. By this means, a\r\nuniform movement was obtained in each direction.\r\n\r\nThe reversal of the bed was accomplished by a roller at either end\r\nof the bed entering a recess in a disc on the driving shaft, which\r\nin a half revolution brought the bed to a stop and started it in the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nThis involved a new principle; a crank action operating directly\r\nupon the bed from a shaft having a fixed centre, and within recent\r\nyears modifications of this patent have been successfully employed to\r\ndrive the type bed at a high velocity and reverse it without shock or\r\nvibration.\r\n\r\nThe “Miehle” Press is a modified form of this movement; the crank pin\r\nor roller is attached to the side of the bed wheel, and at the ends\r\nof the uniform movement it is enclosed within the walls of a vertical\r\nguideway formed at each end of the rack supporting frame, and passes\r\nthrough the length of this guide as it performs its function of\r\nreversing the bed.\r\n\r\nAn improvement in this class of bed motions has lately been made and\r\npatented by Hoe & Co. In this machine the crank pin, which controls\r\nthe reversal of the motion of the type bed, moves in a rectilinear\r\ninstead of a circular pathway. As the motion of the crank is thus\r\ndirectly in line with the travel of the bed, it is possible to lock\r\nthe journal box, enclosing the pin, securely to the bed, while the\r\nbed is being controlled by the action of the crank, and thereby\r\navoids the friction and consequent wear of parts that occur when the\r\ncrank pin moves in a circular line. The movement of the crank is\r\nobtained from the rotatory motion of the bed wheel, and has the same\r\nvarying velocities as would be derived from a crank traveling in a\r\ncircular pathway. It, therefore, checks the momentum of the bed with\r\nease, brings the bed to rest, and returns it with an accelerating\r\nmotion while under positive control. The wearing of parts is thus\r\nreduced to the minimum, insuring an accuracy of register and\r\nexactness of motion hitherto unattainable. A press with a bed\r\nmeasuring 48 × 65 inches runs without jar or vibration at a speed of\r\n1,800 impressions an hour.\r\n\r\nThe press of the present day from which the finest letterpress and\r\nwoodcut work is turned off is known as the “Stop Cylinder.” This\r\nwas devised and patented by a Frenchman named Dutartre, in 1852,\r\nand introduced into this country about 1853 by Hoe & Co., who have\r\nsince patented many improvements upon it. It was a surprise to many\r\nprinters to find that this machine could do work which heretofore it\r\nhad been supposed the hand press only was capable of performing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STOP CYLINDER LITHOGRAPHIC PRESS]\r\n\r\nThe Stop Cylinder Press may be described as follows: The type is\r\nsecured upon a traveling iron bed, which moves back and forth upon\r\nfriction rollers of steel, the bed being driven by a simple crank\r\nmotion, stopping and starting it without noise or jar. All the\r\nrunning portions of this bed are made of fine steel as hard as it\r\ncan be worked. The cylinder is stopped by a cam motion pending the\r\nbackward travel of the bed, and during the interval of rest the sheet\r\nis fed down against the guides and the grippers closed upon it before\r\nthe cylinder starts, thus insuring the utmost accuracy of register.\r\nAfter the impression, the sheet is transferred to a skeleton\r\ncylinder, also containing grippers, which receives, and delivers it,\r\nover fine cords, upon the sheet flier, which in turn deposits it\r\nupon the table. The distribution of the ink is effected partly by a\r\nvibrating, polished, steel cylinder, and partly upon a flat table\r\nat the end of the traveling bed, the number of form-inking rollers\r\nvarying from four to six. This is without doubt the most perfect flat\r\nbed cylinder printing machine that has ever been devised. It is\r\nmade in various sizes. The average output of one of these presses\r\nwith a bed 36 × 54 inches is from 1,000 to 1,500 impressions per hour.\r\n\r\nThe demand being constantly for machines taking on larger sized\r\nforms, there has been lately constructed and patented by R. Hoe & Co.\r\nan entirely new Stop Cylinder Press, having a bed 45 × 62 inches, and\r\nwhich can be run at a speed of 1,700 impressions an hour. The main\r\npoints of difference between the Stop Cylinder Press for type forms\r\nand the Lithographic Press is in the form of the bed only, the other\r\nportions, including the driving apparatus, being almost identical;\r\ntherefore the same general description applies to these new machines\r\nfor both classes of work. A great objection to flat-bed presses of\r\nlarge size has always been the height of the cylinder from the floor,\r\nnecessitated by the increased dimensions of the driving apparatus\r\nunder the bed. In these new presses the bed is reciprocated as usual\r\nby a crank motion, but made exceptionally strong and compounded. This\r\nmethod of construction not only gives the increased speed but makes\r\nthe bed of the machine low down, so that it is better under the hand\r\nand eye of the operator. The product of the machine is delivered\r\nprinted side up, by a patented take-off apparatus, which takes the\r\nsheets from the impression cylinder by grippers in a reciprocating\r\ncarriage and deposits them upon a table. No tapes or guides come in\r\ncontact with the freshly printed ink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROTARY ZINCOGRAPHIC OR ALUMINUM PRESS]\r\n\r\nKeeping pace with the improved methods and machines employed in\r\ntypographic printing, and influenced thereby, the lithographic and\r\nkindred branches of printing have also made progress, induced mainly,\r\nhowever, by the general striving for more rapid and economical\r\nproduction. This has been accomplished by using larger stones, paper\r\nand machines, and by employing rotary machines for some work. The\r\nuse of curved stones for lithography being impracticable for many\r\nreasons, a substitute was found in plates or sheets made of zinc\r\nor aluminum, which, when properly prepared, possess properties akin\r\nto those in lithographic stones. Being flexible, these sheets are\r\neasily stretched over the curved surface of a cylinder. Although\r\nthe development of this branch of printing is due, chiefly, to\r\nthe French and Germans, much has been done in this country toward\r\nits improvement, and work is produced upon Rotary Zincographic or\r\nAluminum Presses that compares favorably with that produced from\r\nstones, and at double the speed. The smaller of these presses,\r\nprinting only one color at a time, prints on sheets 30 × 44 inches,\r\nat a speed up to 2,000 impressions per hour; the larger presses of\r\nthe same kind print on sheets 44 × 64 inches, at a speed up to 1,700\r\nimpressions per hour, although the machines may be run even faster,\r\naccording to the dexterity of the feeder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO-COLOR ROTARY ZINCOGRAPHIC OR ALUMINUM PRESS]\r\n\r\nTwo-Color Rotary Presses are in successful operation in different\r\nparts of this country. In these machines there are two plate\r\ncylinders and one impression cylinder, each of the plate cylinders\r\nhaving its own inking and dampening appliances. The sheet of paper,\r\nafter being fed to the grippers of the impression cylinder, receives\r\none printing from the first plate cylinder, and a second printing,\r\nin a different color, from the second plate cylinder, and is then\r\nreleased from the grippers and delivered in the usual manner by\r\nthe sheet flier. The size of the sheets printed is 44 × 64 inches,\r\nand running at a speed of 1,700 revolutions per hour, the number\r\nof printings is 3,400, or double that obtained from the one-color\r\nmachine of the same size.\r\n\r\nWe now return to a further consideration of the newspaper press.\r\nThe “Single Small Cylinder” and “Double Small Cylinder” machines\r\nheretofore described as primarily the invention of Napier, and\r\nperfected by Hoe & Co. and made by them, came into general use in the\r\nUnited States. In construction and for the quantity and quality of\r\nwork produced they excelled any made in England; the output of one\r\nof the “Single Cylinder” presses reaching 2,000 impressions per hour,\r\nor about as fast as the feeder could lay down the sheets. When still\r\ngreater speed was required the “Double Cylinder” press was used, the\r\ntravel of the bed being of such length that the form of type passed\r\nbackward and forward under both cylinders. Two feeders accordingly\r\nput in the sheets; the maximum speed obtained being about 2,000 from\r\neach cylinder, or 4,000 from the two cylinders per hour, printed on\r\none side. It was evident, both in England and America, that something\r\nfaster must be devised. The growing demand for papers containing\r\nthe latest news necessitated increasing effort on the part of the\r\nmachine-makers. The presses of Dryden & Ford, Middleton, and others\r\nin England failed to meet the requirements there, as did the “Single”\r\nand “Double” Cylinders in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUR CYLINDER ROTARY TYPE-REVOLVING PRESS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEN CYLINDER ROTARY TYPE-REVOLVING PRESS]\r\n\r\nIn 1845 and 1846 the firm of R. Hoe & Co. in New York were busily\r\nengaged upon plans and inventions for presses which should meet the\r\nincreased requirements of the newspapers in America. The result\r\nwas the construction of a press known as the “Hoe Type Revolving\r\nMachine,” embodying patents taken out by Richard M. Hoe. The\r\nfirst one of these machines was placed in the “Ledger” office in\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1846. The basis of these inventions consisted in\r\nan apparatus for securely fastening the forms of type on a central\r\ncylinder placed in a _horizontal_ position. This was accomplished\r\nby the construction of cast-iron beds, one for each page of the\r\nnewspaper. The column rules were made “V” shaped; i. e., tapering\r\ntoward the feet of the type. It was found that, with proper\r\narrangement for locking up or securing the type upon these beds, it\r\ncould be held firmly in position, the surface form a true circle,\r\nand the cylinder revolved at any speed required without danger of\r\nthe type falling out. Around this central cylinder from four to\r\nten impression cylinders, according to the output required, were\r\ngrouped. The sheets were fed in by boys, and taken from the feed\r\nboard by automatic grippers, or fingers, operated by cams in the\r\nimpression cylinders, and which conveyed them around against the\r\nrevolving form of the central cylinder. Here again a great advantage\r\nwas gained by the use of the patented sheet flier, consisting of\r\na row of long wooden fingers fastened to the shaft, and operated\r\nby a cam and springs; the sheet after printing being conducted out\r\nunderneath each feed board by means of tapes to the sheet fliers,\r\nwhich laid them in piles on tables; the number of fliers and tables\r\ncorresponding to the number of impression cylinders. The inking was\r\naccomplished by the use of composition rollers placed between each of\r\nthe impression cylinders; the fountain being below, underneath the\r\nmain type cylinder. The portion of the surface of this type cylinder,\r\nnot occupied by the type itself, was utilized as a distributing\r\ntable, its surface being lower than that of the type, and the inking\r\nrollers rising and falling alternately to place the ink on the type\r\nand receive a new supply from the distributing surface. The first of\r\nthese presses had only four impression cylinders, necessitating four\r\nboys to feed the sheets. The running speed obtained was about 2,000\r\nsheets to each feeder per hour, thus giving, with what was called\r\na “Four Feeder” or “Four Cylinder” machine, a running capacity of\r\nabout 8,000 papers, per hour, printed upon one side. As the demands\r\nof the newspapers increased, more impression cylinders were added,\r\nuntil these machines were made with as many as ten grouped around\r\nthe central cylinder, giving an aggregate speed of about 20,000\r\npapers per hour printed upon one side. A revolution in newspaper\r\nprinting took place. Journals which before had been limited in\r\ntheir circulation by their inability to furnish the papers rapidly\r\nincreased their issues, and many new ones were started. The new\r\npresses were adopted not only throughout the United States, but also\r\nin Great Britain. The first one put up abroad was erected in 1848, in\r\nthe office of “La Patrie” in Paris, but the downfall of the Republic\r\nand the re-imposition of a stamp duty, soon put an end to all\r\nenterprise in French newspaper publishing. The English, always slow\r\nto adopt improvements, did not appreciate the value of these presses\r\nuntil the year 1856, when Edward Lloyd of “Lloyd’s Weekly Newspaper”\r\nin London, having seen the one in the office of “La Patrie,” ordered\r\na “Six-Cylinder” machine. This was erected in his office in Salisbury\r\nSquare, Fleet Street, London, in the following year. It was no sooner\r\nin operation and seen by the other newspaper proprietors than orders\r\nwere received from the London “Times” for two “Ten-Cylinder” presses,\r\nto replace the Applegath machine they were then using. The order\r\nfor these machines was a gratifying tribute to American ingenuity,\r\nfor the “Times” in December, 1848, in an article on the starting\r\nof the Applegath vertical cylinder press, stated that “No art of\r\npacking could make the type adhere to a cylinder revolving around a\r\nhorizontal axis and thereby aggravating centrifugal impulse by the\r\nintrinsic weight of the metal.” Eventually orders from almost all of\r\nthe leading newspapers in Great Britain and Ireland were received.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime various experiments had demonstrated the possibility\r\nof casting stereotype plates on a curve. The process was brought to\r\nperfection by the use of flexible paper matrices, upon which the\r\nmetal was cast in curved moulds to any circle desired, and these\r\nplates were placed upon the Hoe “Type Revolving Machine” upon beds\r\nadapted to receive them instead of the type forms. The newspaper\r\npublishers were thus enabled to duplicate the forms, and run several\r\nmachines at the same time with a view of turning out the papers\r\nwith greater rapidity. In some large offices, such as the New York\r\n“Herald,” London “Daily Telegraph,” and the London “Standard,” as\r\nmany as five of these machines were in constant operation. About\r\nthis time the stamp duty in England of one penny upon each sheet of\r\nprinted matter was repealed. This in itself aided materially in the\r\ndevelopment of the newspaper press.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPLEGATH’S TYPE-REVOLVING PRESS]\r\n\r\nAfter the return of Koenig to Germany, an Englishman named\r\nApplegath, in connection with a machinist named Cowper, made\r\nvarious improvements, mostly in the way of simplifying Koenig’s\r\npresses. After many experiments, they in 1848 constructed for the\r\nLondon “Times” an elaborate machine, entirely upon the cylindrical\r\nprinciple. All of the cylinders of this machine instead of being\r\nhorizontal, as in presses heretofore used, were vertical. The\r\ntype was placed upon a large upright central cylinder, but the\r\ncircumference instead of presenting a complete circle represented\r\nas many flat surfaces as there were columns in the newspaper, the\r\nforms thus being polygonal. Around this central or form cylinder were\r\nplaced eight smaller vertical cylinders for taking the impression,\r\ninking rollers being introduced to ink the type as it passed\r\nalternately from one of these impression cylinders to another. The\r\nsheets were fed down by hand from eight flat horizontal feed-boards\r\nthrough tapes; then grasped by another set of tapes and passed\r\nsideways between the impression cylinder and the type cylinder, thus\r\nobtaining sheets printed upon one side. The impression cylinder\r\ndelivered them, still in a vertical position, into the hands of boys,\r\none stationed at each cylinder to receive them. The results obtained\r\nfrom this machine were in a measure satisfactory, as the number of\r\npapers printed per hour upon one side, from one form of type, was\r\nmaterially increased; not, however, in proportion to the number of\r\nimpression cylinders placed around it, as the press at its best could\r\nproduce but 8,000 impressions per hour, on one side of the sheets.\r\nHaving devised no means to lock up the type other than in flat\r\ncolumns, the polygonal form was a necessity, and the irregularities\r\nin it were made up by underlaying the blankets on the impression\r\ncylinders to take up these inequalities. Although this press, used in\r\nthe London “Times” office, was the only one of the kind ever made,\r\nits size and importance warrant some record and description of it.\r\nThis machine was taken out to make way for Hoe Type Revolving\r\nPresses.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 Sir Rowland Hill had suggested the possibilities of a machine\r\nwhich should print both sides at once from a roll of paper. It is\r\nwell known that for many years cotton cloths had been printed in\r\nthis way, the cylinders being engraved and the cloth after printing\r\nbeing reeled up again. The suggestion, however, was accompanied by no\r\npractical knowledge as to the details, and, above all, no practical\r\nprovision for the rapid cutting off and delivery of the paper either\r\nbefore or after it had been printed. It remained for an American,\r\nWilliam Bullock, of Philadelphia, to construct, in 1865, the first\r\nprinting machine to print from a continuous web or roll of paper.\r\nHis machine consisted of two pairs of cylinders, i. e., two form or\r\nplate cylinders and two impression cylinders. The second impression\r\ncylinder was made of large size to provide additional tympan surface,\r\nto lessen the offset from the first printed side of the paper. The\r\nstereotype plates were not made to fill the whole circumference of\r\neach of the form cylinders, as the sheets were cut before printing.\r\nOne difficulty he had to contend with was the cutting off of the\r\nsheets with sufficient accuracy and rapidity. This he accomplished by\r\nsevering them by means of knives in cylinders. The sheets were then\r\ncarried through the press by tapes and fingers, and delivery sought\r\nto be accomplished by means of a series of automatic metal nippers\r\nplaced upon endless leather belts at such distance apart as to grasp\r\neach sheet successively as it came from the last printing cylinders.\r\nThis machine was put up in several offices and rejected because of\r\nits unreliability, especially in the delivery of the papers, but it\r\nwas finally so far perfected that it came into use to a considerable\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULLOCK PRESS]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the proprietors of the London “Times” inaugurated\r\nexperiments with the view of making a rotary perfecting press, and\r\nfinally started the first one in that office about 1868. It was\r\nsimilar in construction to the “Bullock” press so far as the printing\r\napparatus was concerned, excepting that the cylinders were all of one\r\nsize and placed one above the other. The sheets were severed after\r\nprinting, brought up by tapes, and carried down to a sheet flier\r\nwhich moved back and forth, and “flirted” the sheets alternately into\r\nthe hands of two boys seated opposite one another on either side of\r\nthe sheet flier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONDON TIMES ROTARY MACHINE]\r\n\r\nMarinoni, of Paris, also devised a machine on a similar principle,\r\nmaking the impression and the form cylinder of one size, and placed\r\nthem one above the other. The “Marinoni” machine had separate fly\r\nboards for the delivery of the sheets.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 R. Hoe & Co. also turned their attention to the construction\r\nof a rotary perfecting press to print from a roll or continuous web\r\nof paper.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, the greatest difficulties to be encountered were:--\r\n\r\nFirst. The set-off of the first side.\r\n\r\nDevices were used to overcome this and the ink-makers were induced\r\nto pay special attention to the manufacture of rapid-drying or\r\nnon-setting-off inks.\r\n\r\nSecond. The difficulties in obtaining paper in the roll of uniform\r\nperfection and strength. The paper-makers were led to make a study of\r\nproducing large rolls of paper meeting these requirements, and became\r\nmuch more experienced in its manufacture. The “Walter” press in the\r\n“Times” office had necessitated a very strong and expensive paper,\r\nwhich could not be afforded by the cheap daily press.\r\n\r\nThird. The difficulty of the rapid severing of the sheets after\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\nFourth. A reliable and accurate delivery of the printed papers.\r\n\r\nThese last two operations were not accomplished satisfactorily\r\nuntil the appearance of the Hoe machine. In this press the sheets\r\nwere not entirely severed by the cutters, but simply perforated after\r\nthe printing. They were then drawn by accelerating tapes, which\r\ncompletely separated them, onto a gathering cylinder so constructed\r\nthat six perfect papers, or any other desired number, could be\r\ngathered one over the other. These, by means of a switch, were at\r\nthe proper moment turned off onto one sheet flier, which deposited\r\nthem on the receiving board. This gathering and delivery cylinder,\r\npatented by Stephen D. Tucker, a member of the firm of R. Hoe &\r\nCo., solved the problem of rapid flat delivery. The first of these\r\nmachines was placed in the office of “Lloyd’s Weekly Newspaper,” in\r\nLondon, and the first one used in the United States in the “Tribune”\r\noffice in New York. There was no limit to their capacity for printing\r\nexcepting the ability of the paper to stand the strain of passing\r\nthrough the press, which produced, when put to its speed, 18,000\r\nperfect papers an hour, delivered accurately on one feed-board. The\r\naverage speed, however, in printing offices was 12,000, although in\r\nsome offices they were run at about 14,000 per hour.\r\n\r\nThe “Walter” press, made by the London “Times,” was used by it, and\r\nalso by the London “Daily News” and by the New York “Times.” Further\r\nthan that it made no progress and has now gone entirely out of use,\r\nthe presses of this kind in the London “Times” office having been\r\nreplaced by machines made by R. Hoe & Co. Meantime their machines\r\nwere adopted by most of the large newspapers in the United States and\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nThese new methods, of course, entirely superseded the “Hoe Type\r\nRevolving Machine,” which had reigned supreme in the newspaper world\r\nfor over twenty years, and of which one hundred and seventy-five had\r\nbeen made, almost all of which have now disappeared.\r\n\r\nUp to the middle of the last century the paper had been made from\r\nrags, but as these became unobtainable in sufficient quantity some\r\nsubstitute had to be found. First straw and afterwards wood pulp\r\nwas successfully employed, and paper made from the latter is now in\r\nuniversal use. Its cheapness (averaging now about three cents per\r\npound) materially aided the newspapers, and stimulated the printing\r\nmachine manufacturers to renewed efforts in devising presses of still\r\ngreater speed and efficiency.\r\n\r\nIt was desirable also that the papers should be delivered folded\r\nready for the carrier or mail. The first apparatus to accomplish this\r\nwas similar in design to the hand-fed folding machine in common use\r\nin printing offices. The sheets, fed separately into these machines,\r\nwere carried by tapes running upon pulleys under striking blades,\r\nwhich forced them between pairs of folding rollers. After the first\r\nfold they were again carried in a similar manner under striking\r\nblades, placed at right angles to the first, and again struck down\r\nbetween rollers to receive a second fold. This action was continued\r\nuntil the desired number of folds had been secured. Folders of this\r\ndescription were attached to the fast presses, but none made could\r\nbe worked at a greater speed than about 8,000 per hour, until in\r\n1875 Stephen D. Tucker patented a rotating folding cylinder which\r\nfolded papers as fast as they came from the press, or 15,000 in the\r\nhour. The striking blade folders were used in the “Bullock” press, in\r\nmachines made by C. Potter, Jr., & Co. and others. Andrew Campbell,\r\na printing press manufacturer, also constructed a rotary perfecting\r\npress, but his devices were not original. Four or five machines were\r\nmade by him, and these soon went out of use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST HOE WEB PRESS]\r\n\r\nThe first folders made by Hoe & Co. consisted of the combination\r\nof a “gathering cylinder” with a rotary folding cylinder and tapes\r\nconveying the printed sheets under horizontal folding blades,\r\nsomewhat similar to those before described, which thrust them at the\r\nproper moment between folding rollers placed at alternate angles,\r\nfinally delivering them on travelling belts by a small flier. The\r\nfirst of these folding machines were put upon the presses made for\r\nthe Philadelphia “Times” and operated in the Centennial Exhibition,\r\nin 1876.\r\n\r\nThese folders, however, were only the commencement of a long series\r\nof experiments undertaken by the makers in the development of still\r\nfaster printing and folding mechanisms, and from this time forward\r\nthe progress made has been phenomenal. With great ingenuity, added\r\nto long experience, and by the acquisition and adaptation of every\r\ndevice which should aid them in their efforts, Hoe & Co. succeeded in\r\nproviding machines of unrivalled designs, efficiency and speed.\r\n\r\nAbout 1876 Messrs. Anthony & Taylor of England (the former one of\r\nthe owners of a newspaper in Hereford) took out patents for devices\r\nby which the webs of paper could be turned over after printing on\r\none side and the opposite or reversed side presented to the printing\r\ncylinder. Mr. Hoe, who was in England at the time, appreciating the\r\npossible use and development of these patents, became possessed of\r\nthem for England and the United States.\r\n\r\nE. L. Ford, engaged in the publication of a newspaper in New\r\nYork, patented the uniting of the product of two or more printing\r\nmechanisms and thus producing (in restricted form) a multiple number\r\nof pages at one time. He was unable, however, to develop his plans to\r\nany practical result; but deserves the credit of being the first to\r\npatent, if not to conceive, the idea of the association of printed\r\nsheets for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE SUPPLEMENT PRESS]\r\n\r\nIn the various experiments of Hoe & Co. bearing upon the manipulation\r\nof webs of paper some of their devices appeared to encroach upon\r\npatents secured by Luther C. Crowell, inventor, of Boston, who had\r\nmade an ingenious machine for forming paper bags. These patents were\r\nimmediately secured by purchase and the experimental work proceeded\r\nwith the view of adapting some of them to the requirements of the\r\nprinting press. After many efforts, and the failure and destruction\r\nof several machines which had been constructed at great expense, the\r\nHoe “Double Supplement” machine was produced, the first one being\r\npurchased by James Gordon Bennett of the New York “Herald” and put\r\nto work in his office. The result of these efforts has been, for a\r\nthird time, a complete revolution of the methods of fast newspaper\r\nprinting. The most remarkable features of this machine are: Its\r\nextreme simplicity, considering the varied work it performs, and its\r\ngreat speed, accuracy and efficiency. It turns out either four, six,\r\neight, ten or twelve page papers at 24,000 per hour, and sixteen\r\npage papers at 12,000 per hour; the odd pages being in every case\r\naccurately inserted and pasted in, and the papers cut at top and\r\ndelivered folded. This machine is constructed in two parts, the\r\ncylinders in one portion being twice the length of those in the\r\nother; the short cylinders being used for the supplements of the\r\npaper when it is desired to print more than eight pages. The plates\r\nbeing secured on the cylinders, the paper enters from the two rolls\r\ninto the two portions of the machine, through each of which it is\r\ncarried between the two pairs of type and impression cylinders, and\r\nprinted on both sides, after which the two broad ribbons or “webs”\r\npass over turning bars and other devices, by which they are laid\r\nevenly one over the other, and pasted together. The webs of paper\r\nthen pass down upon a triangular “former,” which folds them along\r\nthe center margin. They are then taken over a cylinder, from which\r\nthey receive the final fold, a revolving blade within this cylinder\r\nprojecting and thrusting the paper between folding rollers, while at\r\nthe same moment a knife in the same cylinder severs the sheet, and\r\na rapidly revolving mechanism, resembling in its motion the fingers\r\nof a hand, causes their accurate disposal upon traveling belts,\r\nwhich convey them on for final removal. From this rather summary\r\ndescription it will be apparent that the principle of retaining the\r\npaper in the web, or unsevered form, up to the final fold and\r\ndelivery, and performing all the operations without retarding the\r\nonward run of the paper, effectually prevents chokes or stoppages\r\nthrough any miscarriage of sheets severed before the folding. Several\r\nhundred of these machines have been made and put in operation by\r\nthe United States; and in offices of the large newspapers in Great\r\nBritain and other countries.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the introduction of the “Double Supplement” press,\r\nhowever, Hoe & Co. had made what is known as the “Double Perfecting”\r\nmachine. The success of this press, which embraces substantially the\r\nprinting and folding devices embodied in the “Double Supplement”\r\nmachine, was the connecting link between the ordinary “single” or\r\ntwo-page-wide press and the “Double Supplement” machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUADRUPLE PRESS]\r\n\r\nThe next improvement in fast presses was the construction of the\r\nmachine known as the “Quadruple” Newspaper Press. This was a\r\nstep in advance of anything heretofore attempted. The first one\r\nwas constructed in 1887 and placed in the office of the New York\r\n“World.” The same principles were embraced in this as in the “Double\r\nSupplement,” but developed to a greater extent. The supplement\r\nportion of the press was increased in width. By means of ingenious\r\narrangements and manipulation of the webs of paper this press was\r\nmade to produce eight-page papers at a running speed of 48,000 per\r\nhour; also 24,000 per hour of either ten, twelve, fourteen or sixteen\r\npage papers; all delivered with great exactness and perfection; cut\r\nat the top, pasted and folded ready for the carrier or the mails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRAIGHT-LINE PRESS]\r\n\r\nAnother form of the Double Supplement and Quadruple machines,\r\nembodying substantially the same principles, is what has been termed\r\nthe “straight-line” press. In this form of construction the cylinders\r\nare arranged in horizontal rows, or tiers, one above the other, there\r\nbeing two pairs of cylinders in each tier, with the folding and\r\ndelivery apparatus at the end of the machine. Some of these presses,\r\nmade under the patent of Joseph L. Firm, and which belong to R. Hoe &\r\nCo., have been constructed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEXTUPLE PRESS]\r\n\r\nIt was thought that the limit of printing capacity in one machine\r\nhad been reached in this new invention, but in 1889 the same firm\r\nundertook the task of constructing a machine for Mr. Bennett of the\r\n“New York Herald,” which would even eclipse the “Quadruple” machine,\r\nwhich had, together with the “Double Supplement” press, superseded\r\nalmost all others in the large offices of the United States, as well\r\nas in Great Britain and Australia. The press made for the “New York\r\nHerald” and known as the “Sextuple” machine, occupied about eighteen\r\nmonths in construction. It is composed of about sixteen thousand\r\npieces. The general arrangement differs entirely from that of the\r\n“Quadruple” machine. The form and impression cylinders are all placed\r\nparallel, instead of any being at right angles as in the “Quadruple”\r\nand “Double Supplement” Presses. To give an idea of this machine, we\r\ncannot do better than to quote the description of it in the “New York\r\nHerald” of May 10th, 1891.\r\n\r\n  “The new Hoe press which is being set up in the ‘Herald,’ Building\r\n  is nothing less than a miracle of mechanism. To say that it is the\r\n  only one of the kind ever built and that it throws all previous\r\n  inventions into the background are facts which the following\r\n  figures abundantly prove.\r\n\r\n  “Its consumption of white paper is so astounding that even the\r\n  imagination grows tired and sits down to catch its breath. It is\r\n  fed from three rolls, each being more than five feet wide. When\r\n  it settles down to show its best work it will use up in one hour\r\n  nearly twenty-six miles of this paper, or to make the matter more\r\n  significant, it will use up about fifty-two miles of paper the\r\n  ordinary width of the ‘Herald’ every sixty minutes.\r\n\r\n  “Our readers will be startled to learn that it can print and\r\n  fold ninety thousand four-page ‘Heralds’ in an hour. This is,\r\n  to the mind, which is not versed in the problem of rapid printing,\r\n  a feat which makes Aladdin’s lamp an old woman’s fable. Ninety\r\n  thousand per hour means fifteen hundred copies per minute, or\r\n  twenty-five copies for every second of time ticked by the clock in\r\n  Trinity’s steeple.\r\n\r\n  “It is, of course, the last and best result of modern\r\n  invention--the highest attainment of genius at the present time.\r\n\r\n  “This new press will print, cut, paste, fold, count and deliver\r\n  72,000 eight-page ‘Heralds’ in one hour, which is equivalent to\r\n  1,200 a minute and 20 a second.\r\n\r\n  “It will print, cut, paste, fold, count and deliver complete 48,000\r\n  ten or twelve-page ‘Heralds’ in one hour, which is equivalent to\r\n  800 a minute and a fraction over 13 a second.\r\n\r\n  “It will print, cut, paste, fold, count and deliver complete 36,000\r\n  sixteen-page ‘Heralds’ an hour, which is at the rate of 600 a\r\n  minute or 10 a second.\r\n\r\n  “It will print, cut, paste, fold, count and deliver complete 24,000\r\n  fourteen, twenty or twenty-four page ‘Heralds’ an hour, which is at\r\n  the rate of 400 a minute, or very nearly seven a second.\r\n\r\n  “This is lightning work with a vengeance and yet it is possible\r\n  that there may be some who read this who will live to call it slow.\r\n  That will probably be when they have found out all about how to put\r\n  a harness on electricity. No one can predict when inventive genius\r\n  will reach its limit in the printing press. But for the present\r\n  this new press marks high water mark.\r\n\r\n  “Before this press was built the fastest presses in the world were\r\n  Hoe’s ‘Quadruple’ Presses, of which the ‘Herald’ has two. These\r\n  presses turn out 48,000 four, six or eight-page papers an hour,\r\n  24,000 ten, twelve, fourteen or sixteen-page papers an hour, and\r\n  12,000 twenty or twenty-four-page papers an hour, all cut, pasted\r\n  and folded.\r\n\r\n  “This new press has a well-nigh insatiable appetite for white\r\n  paper. To satisfy it, it is fed from three rolls at the same time,\r\n  one roll being attached at either end of the press and the third\r\n  suspended near the center. It is the only press that has ever been\r\n  able to accomplish that feat. Each roll is sixty-three inches wide,\r\n  or twice the width of the ‘Herald.’ When doing its best this press\r\n  will consume 25⅞ miles of sixty-three-inch-wide paper--equivalent\r\n  to 51¾ miles of paper the width of the ‘Herald’--in one hour, and\r\n  eject it at the two deliveries in the shape of ‘Heralds,’ each copy\r\n  containing an epitome of the news of the world for the preceding\r\n  twenty-four hours, and each copy cut, pasted and folded ready for\r\n  delivery to the ‘Herald’ readers. It is a sight worth seeing to see\r\n  it done. Certainly we know of nothing else which affords such a\r\n  striking example of the triumph of mechanical genius.\r\n\r\n  “A man turns a lever, shafts and cylinders begin to revolve, the\r\n  whirring noise settles into a steady roar, you see three streams\r\n  of white paper pouring into the machine from the three huge rolls,\r\n  and you pass around to the other side--it is literally snowing\r\n  newspapers at each of the two delivery outlets. So fast does one\r\n  paper follow the other that you catch only a momentary glitter from\r\n  the deft steel fingers that seize the papers and cast them out.\r\n\r\n  “The machine weighs about fifty-eight tons. It is massive and\r\n  strong, with the strength of a thousand giants. And yet though its\r\n  arms are of steel and its motions are all as rapid as lightning,\r\n  its touch is as tender as that of a woman when she carries her\r\n  babe. How else does the machine avoid tearing the paper? It tears\r\n  very readily, as you often ascertain accidentally when turning over\r\n  the leaves. Truly wonderful it is, and mysterious to anybody but an\r\n  expert, how this huge machine can make newspapers at the rate of\r\n  twenty-five a second without rending the paper all to shreds.\r\n\r\n  “It has six plate cylinders, each cylinder carrying eight\r\n  stereotype plates, which represent eight pages of the ‘Herald,’\r\n  and six impression cylinders. These cylinders, when the press is\r\n  working at full speed make 200 revolutions a minute. The period\r\n  of contact between the paper and the plate cylinders is therefore\r\n  inconceivably brief, and how in that fractional space of time a\r\n  perfect impression is made, even to the reproduction of such fine\r\n  lines as are shown in these illustrations, is one of those things\r\n  which, to the man who is not ‘up’ in mechanics, must forever remain\r\n  a mystery. But that it does it you know, because you have the\r\n  evidence of your own eyes.\r\n\r\n  “A double folder forms part of this machine. A single folder would\r\n  not be equal to the task imposed upon it. As it is, this double\r\n  folder has to exercise such celerity to keep up with the streams\r\n  of printed paper that descend upon it that its operations are too\r\n  quick for the eye to follow.\r\n\r\n  “The press has two delivery outlets. At each the papers are\r\n  automatically counted in piles of fifty. No matter how rapidly\r\n  the papers come out, there is never a mistake in the count. It is\r\n  as sure as fate. By an ingenious contrivance--if I should attempt\r\n  to describe it more definitely most people would be none the\r\n  wiser--each fiftieth paper is shoved out an inch beyond the others\r\n  that have been dropped onto the receiving tapes, thus serving as a\r\n  sort of tally mark.\r\n\r\n  “Truly it is a marvelous machine--this Sextuple press. Nowhere\r\n  will you find a more perfect adaption of means to ends; nowhere in\r\n  any branch of industry a piece of mechanism which offers a finer\r\n  example of what human skill and ingenuity is capable of. And it\r\n  is free from that reproach which is sometimes brought against the\r\n  greatest triumph of inventive genius in other departments of human\r\n  activity--that they make mere automatons out of human beings.\r\n\r\n  “The printing press is synonymous with progress, with the\r\n  diffusion of knowledge and the spread of ideas. Without the great\r\n  improvements that have been made in it within the memory of many\r\n  men now living the modern newspaper, the best friend of liberty,\r\n  and the greatest foe of tyranny, would be an impossibility. It\r\n  has more than kept pace with the advancement in other departments\r\n  of industry. In 1829 the Washington Hand Press was introduced and\r\n  regarded as quite a mechanical triumph. At its best it printed 250\r\n  impressions an hour on one side, or 125 complete newspapers of\r\n  insignificant dimensions. Now, a little over sixty years later, a\r\n  machine is brought out which, when the number of papers alone is\r\n  compared, does 150 times as much work in the same time, and which,\r\n  if the comparison is extended to the actual amount of printing\r\n  done, does over 2,000 times as much work.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPLETON ROTARY BOOK PRESS]\r\n\r\nAbout 1871 a machine called the “Prestonian” was made by Foster, a\r\nmachinist of Preston, England, and two or three were set to work, but\r\ndid not enjoy any great degree of favor. They embodied a combination\r\nof the “Hoe Type Revolving Machine” with the “endless sheet\r\nperfecting press.” The form of type for one side of the paper was\r\nplaced upon one cylinder, with impression cylinders around it, in the\r\nmanner of the Hoe press, and the form for the other side on another\r\ncylinder, and the paper passed from one set of impression cylinders\r\nto the other. The principal objection to this machine was its lack of\r\nspeed. The same principle, however, had been developed years before\r\nin the “type revolving perfecting” presses (made by Hoe & Co.) which\r\nhave two sets of type forms on separate large cylinders, the sheets\r\nbeing fed in by hand and conveyed from one impression cylinder to\r\nthe other and against the forms by means of fingers or grippers.\r\nThe sheets were then delivered on a sheet flier. These presses were\r\nespecially designed for printing books, of which large numbers were\r\nrequired, such as text books and spelling books. The contents of\r\na whole book could be placed on these cylinders and printed and\r\ndelivered at one impression. One of these machines constructed\r\nin 1852 (fifty years ago) is still in operation at Messrs. D.\r\nAppleton & Co.’s printing office in Brooklyn, as active and efficient\r\nas ever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROTARY TYPE-REVOLVING WEB PERFECTING PRESS]\r\n\r\nIn 1881 Hoe & Co. turned their attention to the making of a machine\r\nwhich should print FROM ONE FORM OF TYPE at a greater speed than had\r\never yet been attained. The result was the “Rotary Type Endless-sheet\r\nPerfecting Press.” The principle of this machine was in a measure\r\nthat of their “Type-Revolving” press. The forms of type for both\r\nsides of the paper were placed on a central cylinder, which was\r\nsurrounded by impression cylinders and inking rollers.\r\n\r\nThere, were, however, no feeders and no grippers. The roll of paper\r\nwas placed at the end of the press, passed around the impression\r\ncylinders arranged at one side of the form cylinder, and then turned\r\nupside down at the lower part of the machine, thence being carried\r\nupwards. The opposite or unprinted side was presented in turn between\r\neach impression cylinder and the forms. If four impression cylinders\r\nwere placed around the central cylinder then at each revolution of\r\nthe latter four perfect papers were printed. If eight impression\r\ncylinders were placed around the central cylinder then eight perfect\r\npapers were printed at one revolution of the main or form cylinder.\r\nThe speed attained by this machine with four impression cylinders\r\nwas about 12,000 per hour, and from machines with eight impression\r\ncylinders 24,000 copies per hour were printed. This press was\r\nespecially adapted for afternoon papers when the time or expense\r\nnecessarily involved in stereotyping could not be afforded. The\r\nmajority of the machines made were provided with four impression\r\ncylinders only. In the machines with eight impression cylinders two\r\nrolls were used, one at either end of the machine, the paper from\r\neach roll passing under the two first impression cylinders on either\r\nside, each web then being turned over, and paper passed between the\r\ntwo remaining cylinders on either side to print the opposite sides of\r\nthe sheets.\r\n\r\nIn this machine a folding apparatus was placed at each end to receive\r\nthe product of the rolls, but in the machine with four impression\r\ncylinders only one folder was placed, at the end of the machine\r\nopposite that at which the paper entered.\r\n\r\nThe experience gained in the construction of these fast newspaper\r\nmachines, and the accumulation of patented devices entering into\r\nthem, which were numbered by the score, had their influence in the\r\nimprovements which were made upon presses for the printing of weekly\r\nnewspapers, periodicals and magazines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE PAGE WIDE PRESS]\r\n\r\nIn 1888 was introduced a patented Hoe machine called the\r\n“Three-page-wide Press.” It has a capacity of printing, perfecting\r\nand delivering two-page papers, with one fold, at the rate of 60,000\r\nper hour; four-page papers, with two folds, at 24,000 per hour,\r\nsix-page papers at 24,000 per hour; eight-page papers, folded twice,\r\nor to carrier size, at 12,000 per hour, and twelve-page papers,\r\nfolded in the same manner as the eight-page, at the same speed, viz.,\r\n12,000 per hour; all the supplement sheets being inset and pasted if\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nThe prominent features of this machine are:\r\n\r\nThe outside pages may receive the first or the last impression at\r\nwill, thus enabling large cuts and other similar work to be printed\r\nwithout offset.\r\n\r\nGrippers and horizontal folding knives and all tapes but short\r\nleaders are done away with in the delivery and folding mechanisms,\r\nthe movements being all rotary.\r\n\r\nThe press occupies but a small space on the floor, being 6 feet 1\r\ninch high, 8 feet wide and 15 feet 5 inches long over all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEWSPAPER AND PAMPHLET PRESS]\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Hoe & Co. constructed a patented perfecting machine in which\r\nthe plates, or forms, for both sides are placed upon one cylinder,\r\none side of the form of matter being placed upon one end, or half\r\nof the cylinder, and the other side upon the opposite portion of\r\nthe cylinder. One impression cylinder only is used, and the inking\r\napparatus is greatly extended. This machine is remarkable for the\r\ngreat variety of work it will do. At a high rate of speed, sheets of\r\neight, sixteen, twenty-four and so on up to ninety-six or one hundred\r\nand twenty-eight pages may be printed and delivered folded in either\r\n12mo, 8vo, 4to or folio sizes, ready for the binder. The press does\r\nthe work of ten flat-bed cylinder presses and ten hand-feed folding\r\nmachines. The paper is supplied to the machine from the roll, and\r\nafter printing passes over the “former” into the folding machine,\r\nwhere the folding and cutting cylinders produce the required number\r\nof pages in the form desired. Curved electrotypes are now made\r\nsuccessfully and this press was the first to bring the printing of\r\nthe average book and catalogue within the range of web press work.\r\nWhile in general principles this machine is similar to the large\r\nnewspaper perfecting presses, though very much smaller in bulk, it\r\nhas increased facilities for distribution, and finer adjustments\r\nthroughout. The plates admit of underlays and overlays the same as\r\non a flat-bed press. There are no tapes, the folding being done on\r\nrollers and small cylinders without smutting the printing. In the\r\nfolding apparatus there are knives which cut the sheet into the\r\nright size for folding, after which they are automatically delivered\r\ncounted in lots of fifty each. The speed on a thirty-two page form\r\nis about 16,000 copies per hour. This style of machine is probably\r\ndestined to revolutionize book and pamphlet printing, as it combines\r\nthe finest construction and facility of operation with the greatest\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 a further advance was made toward perfection in the rotary\r\nsystem of printing as adapted to doing fine work, in the construction\r\nfor Theodore L. De Vinne, the printer of the “Century” Magazine,\r\nby Hoe & Co., of a perfecting press to do the plain forms of that\r\nperiodical. The machine was described in the magazine, in an article\r\nwritten by Mr. De Vinne, here quoted from:\r\n\r\n(Extract from article published in the “Century” Magazine, November,\r\n1890.)\r\n\r\n  “At the end of a long row of machinery stands the web press--a\r\n  massive and complicated construction, especially built by Hoe & Co.\r\n  for printing, cutting and folding the plain and advertising pages\r\n  of the ‘Century.’ Web presses for newspapers are common enough,\r\n  but this press has distinction as the first, and for three years\r\n  the only, web press used in this country, for good book work. At\r\n  one end of the machine is a great roll of paper more than two\r\n  miles long when unwound, and weighing about 750 pounds. As the\r\n  paper unwinds it passes first over a jet of steam which slightly\r\n  dampens and softens its hard surface and fits it for receiving\r\n  impressions, without leaving it wet or sodden. It passes under a\r\n  plate cylinder, on which are thirty-two curved plates, inked by\r\n  seven large rollers, which print thirty-two pages on one side.\r\n  Then it passes around a reversing cylinder which presents the\r\n  other side of the paper to another plate cylinder, on which are\r\n  thirty-two plates which print exactly on the back the proper pages\r\n  for the thirty-two previously printed. This is done quickly--in\r\n  less than two seconds--but with exactness. But the web of paper is\r\n  still uncut. To do this it is drawn upward under a small cylinder\r\n  containing a concealed knife, which cuts the printed web in strips\r\n  two leaves wide and four leaves long. As soon as cut the sheets\r\n  are thrown forward on endless belts of tape. An ingenious but\r\n  undetectable mechanism gives to every alternate sheet a quicker\r\n  movement, so that it falls exactly over its predecessor, making\r\n  two lapped strips of paper. Busy little adjusters now come in\r\n  play, placing these lapped sheets of paper accurately up to a\r\n  head and a side guide. Without an instant of delay down comes\r\n  a strong creasing blade over the long center of the sheet, and\r\n  pushes it out of sight. Pulleys at once seize the creased sheet\r\n  and press it flat, in which shape it is hurried forward to meet\r\n  three circular knives on one shaft, which cut it across in four\r\n  equal pieces. Disappearing for an instant from view, it comes out\r\n  on the other side of the upper end of the tail of the press in\r\n  the form of four folded sections of eight pages each. Immediately\r\n  after, at the lower end of the tail of the press, out come four\r\n  entirely different sections of eight pages each. This duplicate\r\n  delivery shows the product of the press to be at every revolution\r\n  of the cylinder sixty-four pages, neatly printed, truly cut, and\r\n  accurately registered and folded, ready for the binder. Two boys\r\n  are kept fully employed in seizing the folded sections and putting\r\n  them in box trucks, by which they are rolled out to the elevator,\r\n  and on these sent to the bindery. This web press is not so fast as\r\n  the web press of daily newspapers, but it performs more operations\r\n  and does more accurate work. It is not a large machine, nor is\r\n  it noisy, nor does it seem to be moving fast, but the paper goes\r\n  through the cylinders at the rate of nearly two hundred feet a\r\n  minute. It does ten times as much work as the noisier and more\r\n  bustling presses by its side.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROTARY ART PRESS]\r\n\r\nThe success of this perfecting press induced the makers to devise\r\na machine on the rotary principle adapted for the finest kind of\r\nillustrations--in short, to make a press which should do work as fine\r\nas it was possible to do on the hand press or the stop cylinder.\r\nThe result was the setting up, in 1890, at the De Vinne Press, of a\r\nmachine known as the “Rotary Art” press. This machine is described in\r\nthe “Century” of November, 1890, as follows:--“Sixty-four plates of\r\nthe ‘Century’ truly bent to the proper curve, are firmly fastened on\r\none cylinder sixty inches long, and about thirty inches in diameter;\r\nsixteen inking rollers, supplied with ink from two fountains,\r\nsuccessfully ink these sixty-four plates with a delicacy and yet\r\nwith a fullness of color never before attained. The shafts of the\r\nimpression cylinder and the plate cylinders, 4½ inches in diameter,\r\ndo not give or spring under the strongest impression. Although rigid\r\nin every part, in the hands of an expert pressman it can be made\r\nresponsive to the slightest overlay. This machine is fed by four\r\nfeeders from single sheets in the usual manner, and does the work of\r\nfour stop cylinders in superior style. The gain in performance is\r\nnot as great as the gain in quality of presswork, but quality was\r\nconsidered more than speed. The performance of the machine could have\r\nbeen more than doubled by adding to it other cylinders which would\r\nprint on both sides of the paper; but careful experiment has proved\r\nthat the _finest_ woodcuts cannot be properly printed with this\r\nrapidity. To get the best results the ink on one side of the paper\r\nmust be dry before it is printed on the other side.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “TIT BITS” PRESS]\r\n\r\nAmong the most interesting modern printing machines are those\r\nconstructed by Hoe & Co. at their London works, after drawings and\r\npatterns sent from New York, for weekly English journals, such as\r\n“Tit-Bits,” “Sunday Stories,” and similar periodicals. These machines\r\nembody to a certain extent the principles of the “Double Supplement”\r\npress before referred to. Double sets of plates are placed upon\r\nthe main machine, which is capable of taking on an aggregate of\r\ntwenty-four pages; and by using narrower rolls the number of pages\r\nof the body of the journal may be reduced to sixteen or twenty, so\r\nthat the publisher may have the option of printing his paper either\r\nsixteen, twenty or twenty-four pages. In addition to this it prints\r\na cover on a different colored paper, and all at the rate of 24,000\r\ncopies per hour; the whole product, including the cover, being cut on\r\nthe edges and pasted together at the back. The supplement or cover of\r\nthe press portion, however, instead of having two pairs of cylinders,\r\nas in the “Double Supplement” machine, consists of one form cylinder\r\nand one impression cylinder. This portion of the machine prints the\r\ncover, which is fed from a narrower roll, and, as before stated, of\r\nan entirely different color or quality of paper from the body of the\r\njournal. The form for one side of the cover is placed on one end of\r\nthe form cylinder, and that for the other side on the other end\r\nof the cylinder. This ingenious combination results in the printing\r\nof one cover to every copy of the journal issued and no more.\r\n\r\nThe demand for printed matter seems to increase with the ability to\r\nfurnish it, and much attention is now being directed to the subject\r\nof color printing on the rotary system. From present appearances,\r\nand from the enterprise displayed by the publisher, the artist and\r\nthe press maker, it would seem as though the day is not far distant\r\nwhen this subject alone would furnish matter for a new chapter in the\r\nhistory of the printing press.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to give in a short article even a summary of\r\nthe various kinds of machines to print newspapers of various sizes,\r\nin black as well as in colors, weekly periodicals, magazines, books,\r\npamphlets, in short every class of printing, in connection with\r\nfolding, which have been evolved and perfected up to the present\r\ntime. The work still goes on, one step in advance leading to another,\r\nuntil now a printer can obtain a great variety of machines to print\r\nfrom the roll or fed from separate sheets, and which, especially in\r\nthe production of large numbers, economize both time and labor. Nor\r\nis this constant advance in mechanical construction confined to the\r\nmachines themselves or the manipulation of the paper. It extends to\r\nthe manufacture of the paper and the inks, although the manufacturers\r\nof the latter have not advanced in the same proportion as the\r\npaper-maker, who every year produces finer paper in the roll and in\r\ngreater quantities than ever before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OCTUPLE PRESS]\r\n\r\nThe latest and most elaborate newspaper machine is the Octuple\r\nPerfecting Press with Folders, which prints from four rolls, each\r\nfour pages wide, and gives (from the four deliveries) a running speed\r\nper hour of: 96,000 4, 6 or 8-page papers; 72,000 10-page papers;\r\n60,000 12-page papers; 48,000 14 or 16-page papers; 42,000 18-page\r\npapers; 36,000 20-page papers; 24,000 24-page papers.\r\n\r\nThis machine has been further developed into the Improved Combination\r\nOctuple (or Double Quadruple) and Color Machine, lately patented by\r\nR. Hoe & Co., which, in addition to giving the above mentioned output\r\nwhen printing in black only, will also produce papers in colors at\r\nthe rate per hour of: 96,000 4-pages; 48,000 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 or 16\r\npages; 24,000 18, 20, 24 or 28 pages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE SEXTUPLE PRESS BUILT FOR THE NEW YORK JOURNAL]\r\n\r\nR. Hoe & Co. have now in process of construction four mammoth\r\nprinting machines, which will give a greater product and a greater\r\nvariety of products than any machines that have hitherto been\r\ndevised. They are Double Sextuple Presses and so called, but in\r\nreality are much more than this, inasmuch as they combine the ability\r\nto do printing in colors as well as in black. This machine is\r\ncomposed, so to speak, of two separate, complete printing mechanisms,\r\neach fed from three four-page-wide rolls of paper; the apparatus for\r\nthe gathering and folding of these webs of paper after printing being\r\nin the centre between the two sections of the machine. The “formers”\r\nand folders (placed back to back) enable a manipulation or gathering\r\nof the webs which could not be readily obtained in any other way.\r\nAll these devices and methods have been patented by Hoe & Co. The\r\nfollowing is a summary description of these new machines and what\r\nthey will accomplish. The two sections may be used separately if\r\ndesired, as independent machines.\r\n\r\nEach of the two portions of the machine is composed of six pairs of\r\ncylinders, arranged, with their axles parallel, in three tiers of two\r\npairs each and printing on both sides (or perfecting) three webs of\r\npaper from separate rolls, each four pages wide. One of the sections\r\nis also arranged so that all six sets of cylinders will print upon a\r\nsingle web in colors and black, this web being associated with the\r\nthree webs from the other portion to form a colored cover for the\r\nproducts, when required.\r\n\r\nThe rolls of paper are placed at the end of the machine--three at\r\neach end--and the two folders for each portion are placed back to\r\nback midway in the length of the machine. The runs of all the webs\r\nare therefore approximately the same and as short as it is possible\r\nto have them--a matter of much importance in the running of multiple\r\nwebs.\r\n\r\nAltogether there are twelve plate cylinders in the machine, each\r\ncarrying eight plates the size of a newspaper page. Either stereotype\r\nor electrotype plates may be used. To receive the latter, which are\r\nmuch thinner than stereotype plates, special base or jacket plates\r\nare secured to the cylinders. The ink is applied to the plates by\r\nfour form rollers, after having been thoroughly distributed by\r\nvibrating rollers and cylinders.\r\n\r\nThe full capacity of the machine, when printing all black, on six\r\nrolls, is 96,000 twelve-page papers per hour, and other numbers\r\nof pages at proportionate speeds, namely, four, six, eight and\r\nten-page papers, at the same speed as twelve-page; fourteen and\r\nsixteen-page papers at 72,000 per hour; eighteen, twenty, twenty-two\r\nand twenty-four page papers at 48,000 per hour. The three webs from\r\neach portion of the machine are led to the top of the folders, where\r\nthey are divided along their centre line into webs two pages wide,\r\nand then run down each of the four “formers,” by which they are\r\nfolded along their centre. They are then led through cylinders which\r\ncut them into page lengths and give them a fold across the page to\r\nhalf-page size. In this way twenty-four page papers may be obtained\r\nat the rate of 48,000 copies per hour, by collecting two twelve-page\r\nsections on the cylinder just before the half-page fold is made.\r\nAnother method of running twenty-four page papers is to associate the\r\nsix webs, from both portions of the machine, and run them over one\r\npair of “formers,” thus folding all six webs together, or insetting\r\nthem, in the first fold.\r\n\r\nLesser number of pages may be obtained by making various\r\ncombinations, the number of which is almost limitless. Angle bars\r\nare placed in the machine for transferring half-width webs of\r\npaper from one side of the press to the other, facilitating these\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nThe maximum product of the machine when running as a color press\r\nis 48,000 sixteen-page papers per hour, with the two outside pages\r\nprinted in four colors and black; the other pages in black only. If,\r\nhowever, it is not desired to have so many colors on the outside\r\npages, it is possible to obtain twenty-page papers, at the rate of\r\n48,000 per hour, with the two outside pages in two colors and black;\r\nall the other pages in black only. Papers with any number of pages\r\nfrom four to sixteen, with four colors and black on the outside\r\npages, the other pages in black only, can be obtained at a speed of\r\n48,000 per hour. By running the full product of the color section of\r\nthe machine into one folder and associating therewith webs of paper\r\nfrom the other section of the machine, papers with any number of\r\npages from eight to twenty-four, with the two outside pages and two\r\nof the inside pages printed in four colors and black, the other pages\r\nin black only, can be produced at a speed of 24,000 per hour.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of this machine are as follows: Length, 35 feet;\r\nheight, 17 feet; width, 9 feet; the weight, about 225,000 pounds; and\r\nthe number of parts of which it is composed, approximately 50,000.\r\n\r\nThe last three or four years have also witnessed an immense advance\r\nin the art of color printing. The magazine without an elaborate color\r\ncover, or perhaps colored illustrations, is now an exception, whereas\r\nit was the reverse not long ago. After satisfactory experiments it\r\nwas ascertained by the writer that, with the inks properly prepared,\r\nand suitable plates to print from, colors could be printed almost\r\nsimultaneously upon the paper, without mingling; in short that the\r\nsupposed necessity, in much of the work done, of drying the sheets\r\nafter the impression of each color on the paper, was not necessary\r\nfor the production of a good quality of printing. Further experiments\r\nalso proved the mechanical possibility of obtaining most accurate\r\nregister in printing from a roll and that the number of impressions,\r\nor colors, could be increased to advantage. These various experiments\r\nresulted in the construction by Hoe & Co. of color presses which were\r\nalmost simultaneously installed by the proprietors of the New York\r\n“Herald” and the New York “World,” who commenced the publication\r\nof colored supplements, upon a system which has been adopted by\r\nthe papers in most of the large cities, and which they have never\r\ndiscontinued. The practicability of printing in colors has been so\r\nfully demonstrated that color attachments are being added to very\r\nmany of the large newspaper presses throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive of the color presses, and the largest printing\r\nmachine ever constructed, is the color press made by Hoe & Co.\r\nfor the New York “Journal” and now used in printing portions of\r\nthe Sunday editions of that paper, although others of approximate\r\nproportions and capacity have been made for the New York “World,”\r\nthe New York “Herald,” the Chicago “Tribune,” the Boston “Post” and\r\nother newspapers. This machine gives as many as eleven separate\r\nimpressions, or colors, on a single copy of the paper; that is, it\r\nwill print in six colors on one side of the sheet and five on the\r\nother, or it may be arranged to print three colors on one side and\r\nsix on the other, giving a speed of about 16,000 eight-page papers\r\nan hour, or at every revolution of the cylinders the equivalent of\r\ntwo perfect eight-page papers printed in colors. Four, six, eight,\r\nten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, twenty, twenty-four, twenty-eight or\r\nthirty-two-page papers may be printed on this machine, as required,\r\nfrom one, two or three double-width (or four-page-wide) rolls of\r\npaper. It will also produce magazine forms (with pages half the\r\nsize of those of the regular issue of the paper) at from 16,000 to\r\n24,000 an hour, either 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 40 or 48 pages, delivered\r\nfolded, cut, and automatically wire-stitched, with all the pages\r\nprinted in colors or half-tones.\r\n\r\nSuch a development of the art of printing, especially in colors,\r\nin which accurate register is not only necessary, but must be\r\nmaintained, would have seemed incredible a few years ago, but this\r\nis now a daily occurrence and many newspaper offices produce colored\r\nsupplements in the same manner and with the same results, having\r\nadditions placed upon their quadruple, sextuple and other presses for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “COLLIER’S WEEKLY” PRESS]\r\n\r\nNor has this development of colors been confined entirely to the\r\ndemands of the newspaper world. It is gradually finding its way\r\ninto the weekly periodical and the monthly magazines. It had been\r\nconsidered impossible to print half-tone illustrations on both\r\nsides of the sheet at one operation and deliver them flat, without\r\nsmutting. Not only has this difficulty been overcome, but in the\r\nlatest presses, such as used by Collier’s Weekly, the finest\r\nhalf-tone work is done on a perfecting press printing on a roll of\r\npaper. The periodical is printed in multiple pages, as required, and\r\ndelivered from the machine folded, cut apart and pasted, ready for\r\nthe binder. It is not desirable, of course, when using fine inks, to\r\nmake immediate delivery from the press; therefore the papers, after\r\nhaving been perfected, folded and pasted, are left to stand for\r\nsome hours before they are distributed to the readers. Satisfactory\r\nmethods of doing this have also been devised. The capacity for\r\nprinting fine half-tone illustrations on a rotary press having thus\r\nbeen demonstrated the next step is evidently the production of\r\ncolored half-tones, and the time is undoubtedly near at hand when\r\nthe monthly magazine as well as the weekly periodical will appear,\r\ninstead of in black half-tones, now so popular, with these same\r\nillustrations printed in the most delicate manner in colors and all\r\ndelivered in perfection from rotary presses, folded in entirety, or\r\nin signatures, ready for the binder.\r\n\r\nIt must now be evident to every experienced observer that the time\r\nhas arrived when printing upon the rotary system will in a large\r\nmeasure supersede that now done upon flat-bed cylinder presses,\r\nalthough the latter will always be retained for some kinds of work.\r\nSatisfactory methods will be devised for attaching upon the cylinders\r\nelectrotype or stereotype plates of varying sizes. In addition to\r\nthis, new and improved methods are constantly being brought forward\r\nfor the transferring of type forms, photographs and illustrations\r\nof every description, upon prepared sheets of metal, which receive\r\nthe ink and give impressions either from a raised surface, as in the\r\nordinary letter-press printing, or in the manner of lithographic\r\nprinting. These and other new methods of making plates will\r\nundoubtedly lead in the future to great economy, as well as to\r\nimportant improvements in the process of printing.\r\n\r\n                                                          ROBERT HOE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (Colophon)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (FROM MEDAL BY SCHARFF)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n  The List of Illustrations at the beginning of the book was created\r\n  by the transcriber.\r\n\r\n  Placement of Illustrations have been slightly adjusted to better\r\n  coordinate with the text.\r\n\r\n  Inconsistencies in hyphenation and spelling such as “flat-bed/flat\r\n  bed” and “letter-press/letterpress” have been maintained.\r\n\r\n  Page 31: Added double quote to “Double”.",
